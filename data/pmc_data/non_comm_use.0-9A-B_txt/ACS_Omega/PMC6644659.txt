MCMap
is a tool particularly well-suited for analyzing energy landscapes
of transient macromolecular complexes. The program applies a Monte
Carlo strategy, where the ligand moves randomly in the electrostatic
field of the receptor. By applying importance sampling, the major
interaction sites are mapped, resulting in a global distribution of
ligand–receptor complexes. This approach displays the dynamic
character of transiently interacting protein complexes where not a
single complex but an ensemble of complexes better describes the protein
interactions. The software provides a broad range of analysis options
which allow for relating the simulations to experimental data and
for interpreting them on a structural level. The application of MCMap
is exemplified by the electron-transfer complex of cytochrome c peroxidase and cytochrome c from baker’s
yeast. The functionality of MCMap and the visualization of simulation
data are in particular demonstrated by studying the dependence of
the association on ionic strength and on the oxidation state of the
binding partner. Furthermore, microscopically, a repulsion of a second
ligand can be seen in the ternary complex upon the change of the oxidation
state of the bound cytochrome c. The software is
made available as open source software together with the example and
can be downloaded free of charge from http://www.bisb.uni-bayreuth.de/index.php?page=downloads.

Introduction
Protein–protein interactions play
a central role in many
cellular processes such as signal transduction, gene regulation, and
molecular bioenergetics. The formed protein complexes can be very
stable with low dissociation rates as, for instance, in the case of
antigen–antibody complexes, or they can be very short-living,
having only a transient nature, as, for instance, in the case of electron-transfer
protein complexes. Especially for electron-transfer protein complexes,
it is important to find a reasonable balance between directional association
to ensure correct pairing of partners and the possibility of quick
exchange.1,2 Thus, the interactions between the electron-transfer
proteins are often very dynamic compared to other complexes.3−5 In many cases, a single complex structure cannot describe the diversity
of complexes for transiently interacting proteins very well but can
be better described by an ensemble of complexes assuming different
orientations and binding sites. This behavior can also be observed
in crystal structures of several electron-transfer complexes, where
the electron density of the smaller protein is often not as well defined
as that of the receptor.6−8 Multiple binding conformations
and orientations of the ligand result in a structure ensemble, which
causes a more or less smeared electron density of the smaller binding
partner. A similar observation was made before, where a combination
of specific and loosely bound complexes was used to describe the diversity
of an encounter complex.9 The combination
of replica exchange Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and experimental
paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements revealed that
certain key residues often account for protein contacts in both, the
specific and unspecific ones. Transient complexes have usually high
dissociation rates, and the proteins often have only minor surface
complementarity. Protein association processes for these types of
proteins can be classified in two to three association steps. If the
two molecules are far away from each other, mainly long-range interactions
such as electrostatic interactions are important for attractive forces
bringing them in the vicinity of each other, forming the so-called
encounter complex.10 When the proteins are in contact distance, they can scan
the surfaces of each other.11 This phase
of the association is often described by an ensemble of energetically
favorable orientations. During this phase, short-range interactions
such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions become more and
more important and contribute to the complex formation and stabilization
of the final complex.12,13 In order to get a first idea
of binding, mainly long-range interactions need to be considered.
Interactions such as electrostatic attraction and repulsion mainly
contribute to the primal complex formation and direct the proteins
toward the binding areas. The theoretical analysis of protein–protein
association is a major challenge, especially for transient protein
complexes. Many different approaches are commonly used.14 An example of a widely used tool for evaluating
binding affinities to a certain extent is docking simulations. For
many docking tools, it is, however, a major challenge to predict yet
unknown binding sites. Different tools have been applied for finding
and validating first guesses of docking sites, for example, molecular
dynamics simulations,15−18 Brownian dynamics,19−21 and MC dockings involving random movements.22−25 In previous studies, we could demonstrate that such MC predictions
can be well-correlated with experimental data, namely, with NMR studies,
in which spin labels causing PREs have been attached to the proteins
in order to visualize the lowly populated states of the encounter
ensemble of transient complexes.5,9,13,22,26−31 The simulated encounter ensemble reflected the dynamic behavior
of the transient complexes well, which cannot be described by a single
protein complex.

In this paper, we present the background and
usage of the program
MCMap, which approximates the distribution of possible protein interactions
by generating an ensemble of protein complexes (distributed over the
surface of a receptor). The program uses a Metropolis MC algorithm32 to evaluate the interaction energy and, with
this, the probability of an encounter to occur. It can be used as
a tool to identify binding sites in a rigid-body docking approach,
especially if the association is driven by electrostatic interactions,
which is often the case for protein–protein complexes. Hydrophobic
interactions are currently not included in the energy calculation.
The inclusion of these interactions is, however, planned for future
development of MCMap. As a ligand, a small molecule, another protein,
or a nucleic acid can be used. For demonstrating the usage and the
capabilities of the software, we analyze the well-studied complex
of cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and cytochrome c (Cc) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CcP and Cc are located in the intermembrane section of mitochondria,
where the ferrous form of Cc forms a complex with CcP to reduce hydrogen
peroxide to water.33,34 The complex formation of the
two electron-transfer proteins is mainly driven by electrostatics.
Thus, long-range charge–charge attraction allows for preorientation
of proteins and thus limits the conformational search for the final
complex formation.28 Recently, it was shown
that not only long-range interactions play a role in protein association
but also the local interactions can have some impact on the association
process of two proteins.35 In the first
section of the paper, we introduce the algorithm used in MCMap and
the methods for analyzing the simulation results. In the second part,
we illustrate the analysis of the complex distributions obtained by
MCMap. In particular, we analyze the association of CcP and Cc in
different oxidation states and at different ionic strength values.

Software Features
MC Simulation of Association
The
program MCMap generates
a distribution of encounter complexes by randomly translating and
rotating one molecule in the field of the other using Metropolis MC.
This ensemble characterizes the transient complex and possible interactions
in this complex. The density of complexes resembles the probability
of an encounter at the specific position. Because the program samples
all translational and rotational degrees of freedom, MCMap can even
be applied if little is known about the binding site. The protein
structures of the two partners, which we, from now on, refer to as
the ligand and the receptor, are kept fixed during the MC simulation
while translational and rotational movements are allowed. A general
overview of the workflow of MCMap can be seen in Figure 1. For computational reasons,
it is advantageous to use the smaller docking partner as the ligand.
The structures have to be provided in the PQRM-format, which is a
modified PDB-format containing partial charges, radii, and masses
of the atoms in the last three columns after the xyz coordinates. Such a PQRM-file can, for instance, be obtained from
CHARMM36 results with the help of the converter
program psfcrd2pqr, which is provided together with MCMap. The electrostatic
potentials are provided as OpenDX-files (a format for representing
volumetric data) that can, for instance, be calculated by the program
APBS,37 which solves the Poisson–Boltzmann
equation for a heterogeneous dielectric environment.38 The electrostatic potential is provided on two grids, a
large coarse grid and a small fine grid. The fine grid allows a more
detailed representation of the electrostatic potential when the two
proteins are in closer proximity.

Figure 1 Overall workflow diagram for the usage
of MCMap: MCMap needs structural
information, the electrostatic potentials, and an exclusion grid as
a starting point. After simulating the association, the results are
processed with print-coor. Depending on the chosen analysis, the simulation
results can be visualized with the focus on either the receptor or
the ligand. Alternatively, the whole simulation can be analyzed by
contact map histograms.

The overall flowchart of the MC algorithm is shown in Figure 2. A schematic representation
of an MCMap run is depicted in Figure 3. In the beginning of a simulation, the center of mass
of the ligand is randomly placed on the surface of a sphere with the
radius Rin. The center of mass of the
receptor is placed at the center of this sphere. The electrostatic
potential of the receptor at this sphere should be very close to zero
or at least have a spherical symmetry to a good approximation in order
to avoid a bias in the calculation stemming from the initialization.
The interaction energy Eint between the
ligand and the receptor is obtained by multiplying the charges qn,lig of the ligand with the
electrostatic potential Φrec(r)
of the receptor (eq 1). 1  where Nlig is
the number of atoms of the ligand. The potential Φrec at the position rn of
the charge qn,lig is
obtained by linear interpolation of the surrounding grid points. Subsequently,
the ligand is randomly translated and rotated, and the energy is re-evaluated
using eq 1. This random
move is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion.39 The next steps in the simulation are performed
equivalently. In order to allow for a more detailed sampling of the
interaction surface in the vicinity of the proteins, the MC moves
are scaled down. In each MC move, it is checked whether the ligand
reaches a specified distance Rout originating
from the center of mass of the receptor. If the ligand reaches this
distance, it is being considered to be too far away from the receptor
for a proper interaction and the ligand is reinitialized at the starting
surface with the radius Rin. This approach
shows clear similarities to the Brownian dynamics procedure11,19−21,40 but has the advantage
that no forces need to be calculated and the generated ensemble directly
represents a Boltzmann ensemble without further data manipulation.

Figure 2 Flowchart
of the algorithm implemented in MCMap: the simulation
starts by placing the ligand on the surface of the inner sphere (see Figure 3). Then, the ligand
moves randomly in space. If the proteins do not collide, the ligand
energy is calculated and the step is evaluated by the Metropolis MC
criterion. This cycle is repeated until the maximum number of steps
is reached.

Figure 3 Schematic illustration
of two exemplary MC runs. The inner and
outer boxes around the receptor represent its electrostatic potential
on fine and coarse grids, respectively. In trajectory 1, the ligand
starts at radius Rin and proceeds to the
surface of the receptor with each MC step visualized by connected
lines. In trajectory 2, the ligand starts at a different position
on Rin and moves to the radius Rout, where the MC run is aborted.

In addition to the evaluation of the electrostatic
energy, it has
to be made sure that the two molecules do not penetrate each other.
The usage of a Lennard-Jones type of energy term would be computationally
too expensive because it would require Nlig × Nrec distance evaluations. Instead,
we use an exclusion grid, which is a regular grid describing the shape
of the receptor. The exclusion grid is generated by the program make-excl
and saved as a binary file. Each point of the exclusion grid is flagged
being either in the receptor or in the solvent. If, during the simulation,
the distance between the ligand and the receptor is such that the
two molecules can collide, the exclusion grid is invoked. Thereby,
it is tested if a surface atom of the ligand is entering a grid cell
of the exclusion grid that is occupied by the receptor. If that is
the case, the move is rejected. The test is computationally very inexpensive
and requires only a few rounding processes to identify the appropriate
grid points. Moreover, the number of operations just scales linearly
with the number of surface atoms of the ligand. In case of several
consecutive rejections, it is assumed that the simulation got stuck
in a (local) minimum and the ligand is reinitialized at the starting
radius Rin.

The MC simulation proceeds
until the maximum number of MC runs
is reached. The ensemble is stored in an orientation file, which contains
information on the energy and the coordinate transformation required
for generating the orientation from the initial structure. Each line
of this orientation file, which is a compressed ASCII file, contains
one orientation. Storing the ensemble in this form has several advantages.
Besides saving storage space compared to a storage of full structures,
it is also possible to use only a subset of the original structure,
for instance, only the prosthetic groups, for the generation of the
orientation. This method substantially speeds up the analysis. Moreover,
this orientation file can, for instance, be resorted by energy, facilitating
the use of only orientations with energies below a certain threshold
for further investigation. Thus, the way how MCMap saves its generated
ensemble gives a large flexibility for the subsequent analysis.

The runtime of the simulation does not depend on the size of the
receptor but mainly depends on the number of atoms in the ligand.
Hence, it is recommended to use the smaller molecule as a ligand to
speed up the simulation. In our example, a MCMap simulation with a
ligand of 1772 atoms and 103 MC runs, each run consisting
of 2.5 × 104 MC steps, results in about 2.6 ×
104 different orientations and takes approximately 20 min
on a single core Intel Core i7-4790 with a speed of 3.6 GHz.

Ensemble
Analysis and Processing
The MCMap suite provides
a couple of tools to analyze the generated ensemble of configurations.
The main utility for processing the distribution of configurations
is the program print-coor. This program can, on the one hand, be used
for generating representations of the ensemble, which can be visualized
with molecular viewers such as VMD41 or
PyMOL.42 On the other hand, print-coor
can reduce the encounter ensemble to highlight regions of interest.
In the way MCMap stores the results, that is, representing each structure
of the ensemble by a linear transformation of the reference orientation,
the distribution of ensemble structures can be inspected not only
with respect to the receptor but also vice versa with respect to the
ligand. This possibility allows for the easy identification of high-affinity
binding patches on the surface of either the ligand or the receptor.

The program print-coor can analyze the ensemble contained in the
orientation file of MCMap in different modes. One possibility is to
generate each individual orientation of the ligand or of the receptor,
which allows for analyzing individual orientations directly. Another
way to analyze the ensemble of configurations is to generate the center
of mass of either the ligand around the receptor or the receptor around
the ligand. This information can also be visualized as a density (in
OpenDX format). This density gives a fast overview of the simulation
results and can be inspected with many molecular viewers in different
representations such as isocontour plots or volume density slices.
An example for such representations can be seen in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Overview of different
representations of the center of mass density
obtained from the MCMap runs. CcP is represented with the electrostatic
potential mapped on the surface ranging from −5 (red) to 5
kcal/e° (blue). Cc is
shown in silver, with the heme being highlighted in red. The green
isosurface represents the positions where the center of mass of Cc
was found at least 100 times in the ensemble. The blue color in the
background illustrates a slice through the volume of the obtained
ensemble ranging from 0 (white) to at least 40 (dark blue) orientations.

The program print-coor can not
only help to visualize the structure
ensemble but also reduce it as follows. Print-coor creates subensembles,
which make a deeper inspection of specific regions easier. For this
purpose, the program determines the distance between the ligand and
the receptor and only orientations in which the distance between any
given atom of the ligand and receptor is smaller than a given threshold d are taken into account for this subensemble. Another way
to alter the ensemble is to invoke an inclusion grid. The idea thereby
is similar to the procedure for excluding structures in case of protein
collisions, as described in the section of the MCMap algorithm. Instead
of excluding a ligand orientation entering the region that is occupied
by the receptor, all orientations entering the regions that are defined
by an inclusion grid are saved in a new subensemble. The inclusion
grid presents a more efficient way for estimating whether certain
regions of ligand and receptor are in proximity of each other upon
complex formation. Similar to the exclusion grid, the inclusion grid
can be generated by the program make-excl; the probe sphere radius
needs to be adjusted to include larger regions around the receptor.
This approach is computationally efficient and particularly of interest
if the receptor molecule is nonspherical.

An overview of the
simulations can also be obtained by creating
a contact map histogram of all orientations, allowing for mapping
major interaction regions to single atoms or amino acids. If the distance
of an amino acid or atom of the ligand to an amino acid or atom of
the receptor is smaller than a specified threshold, the counter in
the 2D histogram is increased. The resulting histogram is written
as an ASCII file, which can be plotted with PyCoALA (the Python Contact
Area Localization and Analysis tool, distributed with MCMap) or any
plotting tool such as GMT43 or alternatively
be further processed. For relating histograms of different simulations
to each other, each histogram is normalized to the total amount of
orientations saved in the individual MC simulation. This normalization,
which prevents misinterpretation by comparing simulations resulting
in ensembles which are differing in size, can be easily performed
with PyCoALA. For a better representation, the histogram is then scaled
such that the maximal occurrence is set to one.

Together with
MCMap, we provide PyCoALA, i.e., a tool that supports
a representation of a contact map histogram on the protein structure
using two different modes, namely, (i) hot spot visualization or (ii)
difference mapping by histogram subtraction. For both types of modes,
contact map histograms are used as inputs, which can have either atomic
or amino acid resolution. The contact surface regions of interest
are represented on the respective protein surface. For this purpose,
the residues that are involved in more than a certain number of contacts
are colored on the surface of the receptor and ligand by a PyMOL script.42 If differences between various simulations need
to be examined, a subtraction of the results can help to identify
the areas where the major differences occur. Positive values of the
subtracted data are visualized in blue, and negative values are visualized
in red. Analogous to the heatmap representation, the contact differences
can be mapped back on the protein surface. An example for a visualization
with the PyCoALA back-mapping strategy is described in the example
below.

Example: Interaction Mapping for Yeast CcP
and Yeast Cc
In this section, we demonstrate the usage of
the MCMap suite by
applying the software to the complex of CcP and Cc. This complex has
been analyzed in many previous experimental and also some theoretical
studies.21,40,44−48 Moreover, structurally, this complex was characterized by X-ray
crystallography49 and NMR.28,29,50 The complex shows many interesting
features. Most notably, its association is largely governed by electrostatic
interactions. Consequently, the association depends strongly on the
ionic strength of the solution. Moreover, because the two reaction
partners perform an electron-transfer reaction, their association
is influenced by the redox state of the reaction partners. In the
following parts, we will demonstrate how the influence of these different
parameters can be simulated, analyzed, and visualized using MCMap.

Influence
of Ionic Strength on the Association
The
complex formation of CcP and Cc depends strongly on electrostatic
interactions and is therefore well-suited to be studied with MCMap.
In order to determine how protein association is influenced by the
salt concentrations, we studied complex formation at 0, 10, 20, 50,
and 100 mM ionic strength. A change in the ionic environment can result
in a relocation of binding sites. An overview of such a docking analysis
for different ionic strength values is shown in Figure 5. At a lower ionic strength, two binding
sites can be seen, a major one at a negatively charged surface area
of CcP at the crystallographic binding site and a minor one at the
site distal from the primary site.28,50 Inspection
of the density of Cc around CcP and vice versa shows that the specific
interaction surface of Cc shrinks with increasing ionic strength,
causing random encounters to be more populated at higher ionic strength.

Figure 5 Distribution
of MC configurations for Cc (left) and CcP (middle)
in dependency of ionic strength (0, 10, 20, 50, 100 mM). The green
isosurfaces represent the count of the center of mass of CcP (left)
and Cc (middle). The cutoff was set to 150 for the representation.
The electrostatic potential is mapped on the surfaces of CcP and Cc
ranging from −5 (red) to 5 kcal/e° (blue). The plots on
the right show the scaled normalized population of the obtained ensemble
in dependency of the heme-to-heme distance of Cc and CcP and the energy
of the orientation.

Because CcP and Cc are
electron-transfer proteins, the distance
between the redox cofactors, namely, the hemes, is an important parameter
that can be analyzed in the generated ensemble. If one plots the probability
of occurrence of encounter complexes in dependence of the shortest
heme-to-heme distance of CcP and Cc and the corresponding energy,
two minima can be identified at low ionic strength. These two minima
represent two preferred binding orientations. With increasing ionic
strength, the interaction weakens, though the previously identified
hot spots are still present to an extent of about 20%. To inspect
the interacting regions and the binding orientations in more detail,
we generate contact map histograms. Such histograms for Cc and CcP
at an ionic strength of 0 and 100 mM are depicted in Figure 6. Comparing the contact map
histogram of 0 mM with the contact map of the crystal structure, it
can be seen that the contacts of the crystal structure can be well-reproduced
(Figure 6A,B). Some
additional contacts can be identified, which arise from the analysis
of the whole ensemble of complex formations. These contacts are located
on the surface in the vicinity of main interacting residues. When
key residues are engaged in contacts stemming from many different
orientations, neighboring residues also get involved to a certain
extent. These more distributed interactions underline the transient
character of the encounter complex. Interestingly, for the key residues
D148 and K149 of the secondary binding site, contacts with a population
up to 11–25% can also be identified at low ionic strength.
At 100 mM, the total docking events decrease, whereas the relative
specificity of individual amino acids can still be sustained, as is
expected with increasing ionic strength (Figure 6C). However, subtracting the normalized contact
map histograms at 0 and 100 mM from each other allows identification
of differences between the ensembles at different ionic strength values
and highlights which residues are less involved in contacts at higher
salt concentrations (Figure 6D). With the combination of contact map histograms and energy
distribution plots, we can show that the experimentally characterized
loss of the lowly populated binding sites and the shift of the contact
surface induced by a higher salt concentration45,48 can be reproduced by our MC simulations. The various analysis and
plotting methods provide a powerful tool to connect experimental data
with structural information derived from the MC simulation.

map histograms of the docked CcP–Cc complexes at 0 (B) and
100 mM (C) ionic strength. The difference between the contact map
histograms at 0 and 100 mM can be seen in part D. The x- and y-axes correspond to the amino acids of the
respective protein. Any contact within a distance of 8 Å or less
is counted, and counts are color-coded, as shown in the legends.

Influence of Cc Heme Oxidation
States on the Formation of the
Complex
An important parameter that influences the association
of electron-transfer proteins is their oxidation state. Experimentally,
such an influence is often hard to access because many experimental
methods are only applicable in certain redox states. Simulations are
therefore a good alternative for analyzing the influence of this parameter.
In MCMap, different redox states are modeled by assigning appropriate
partial charges to the redox centers. For CcP, reduced Cc (Fe2+ state) is the natural electron donor. In order to guarantee
a high turnover, it would be biologically advantageous if oxidized
Cc (Fe3+) would not bind as tightly. To probe this possibility,
we simulated the association of CcP with both oxidized and reduced
Cc at an ionic strength of 100 mM.

At first glance, the density
distributions obtained for the two oxidation states of Cc are quite
similar. However, the differences can be seen when the encounter density
obtained for oxidized Cc is subtracted from the density obtained for
reduced Cc (Figure 7A,B). The binding site of reduced Cc is more distributed, whereas
the oxidized form with its more positive charge is more focused on
the main interaction patch (Figure 7C,D).

Figure 7 MC distribution of configurations for different oxidation
states
of Cc with CcP at an ionic strength of 100 mM. The ensemble is shown
as “original” ensemble (A,B) and as a difference between
the Fe2+ and the Fe3+ (C,D) ensemble: density
of encounters for CcP around Cc (A/C) and vice versa (B/D). The total
docking density is highlighted in green for Fe2+ and in
iceblue for Fe3+. The difference density in red shows the
region with a difference of at least −6 (C) or −40 (D)
encounter formation events; that is, encounter formations of the Fe3+ oxidation state were predominant in these regions. A difference
of +6 (C) or +40 (D) is shown as a blue isosurface.

While the difference map gives a reasonable approximation
of the
extent of the encounter complexes, the surface mapping tool PyCoALA
grants a more detailed overview of which residues are mainly contributing
to the complex formation. Utilizing PyCoALA, the difference between
contact map histograms for the different oxidation states can be plotted
and mapped to the protein surface. The residues that show a difference
are depicted in Figure 8. It becomes clear that many interacting residues on CcP are the
same for both oxidized and reduced states of Cc (shown in purple);
however, the contacting areas of Cc shift slightly. With the interaction
difference mapped on the surface, two distinct separated regions on
Cc can be identified. Whereas K87 and K89 exclusively show many interactions
with the peroxidase for reduced Cc, the interaction profile shifts
to a region located around R13 and G83 for the oxidized Cc. Even if
this change in the binding area is not dramatic, a difference between
the oxidized and reduced ensembles can be seen, which may also influence
the binding affinity.

visualized
with the most affected residues highlighted: (A) difference of the
contact map histogram between amino acids of CcP and Cc after subtraction
of Cc Fe3+ oxidation state from Cc Fe2+ oxidation
state results. (B) Overview of the complex between Cc and CcP with
the regions with the highest differences between both oxidation states
color-coded. Residues highlighted in red have the most negative values
in the subtraction; that is they are more populated for Fe3+ oxidation state, whereas residues in blue show the most positive
values. Residues highly populated in both oxidation states are colored
purple. The major binding region is highlighted separately on the
surfaces of Cc (C) and CcP (D). The amino acids are labeled like in
the crystal structure.

Ternary Complexes
For the reduction of hydrogen peroxide
to water, two electrons are required. Because CcP may bind several
copies of Cc,48,51 two different mechanistic scenarios
are possible. Either, two reduced molecules of Cc bind consecutively;
that is, the first Cc dissociates after the first electron transfer,
giving way to a second Cc as an electron donor; or, two reduced Cc
molecules bind to CcP at the same time and the two electron transfers
occur without the necessity for dissociation.

We use our MC
docking method to test if two copies of Cc could bind simultaneously
to CcP. For this purpose, we use the crystal structure of the complex
between CcP and one Cc49 as the receptor
for two different MC simulations. In one simulation, we assume that
the bound Cc is reduced, and in the other simulation, it is oxidized.
The calculated electrostatic potential of the receptor represents
thus the complex of CcP and the first bound Cc molecule. The ligand,
that is, Cc that binds to the binary complex of Cc and CcP is always
assumed to be reduced. For the simulation in which the bound Cc is
reduced (Figure 9A),
we obtained two binding spots: a small one near the interface between
the bound Cc and CcP and a more extended one at the position of the
secondary binding site.28,40 In the simulation with
the bound oxidized Cc, the small binding spot instead virtually disappears
(Figure 9B). In order
to visualize the difference between the simulations, the density for
the oxidized state was subtracted from the density for the reduced
state (Figure 9C).
The difference density confirms the lower population of the binding
spot near the interface but also shows that the outer part of the
secondary binding site has a higher population in the reduced state.
It seems that if a Cc molecule is already bound to the main binding
site of CcP, the secondary binding site is highly promoted for interactions.
The small binding spot near the interface can be explained by the
influence of the remaining potential of the main binding site of CcP.
The potential of CcP is not completely neutralized by the bound Cc
and attracts a second Cc molecule. The changed binding behavior of
the ligand to the different redox states of the CcP-bound Cc can also
be seen in the population diagrams, where the energies of the different
orientations are related to the distances between ligand heme and
CcP heme (Figure 9D)
and their probability of occurrence. The distributions look similar
for both oxidation states with the energetically favored encounters
being higher populated and more widely spread in the reduced form.
Apparently, the oxidized form of Cc repels another Cc molecule more
strongly, which can be seen by less low-energy encounters and a shift
of the distribution to a higher heme-to-heme distance. Considering
the plot of the distances between the ligand heme and CcP heme and
the one between ligand heme and bound Cc heme (Figure 9E), we can clearly identify two clusters
being predominant for the reduced simulation. Upon oxidation of the
bound Cc, a shift of the hot spots from a short distance to a widely
spread cluster equally distant to Cc and CcP heme can be observed.
These findings agree with the idea that two binding Cc molecules repel
each other electrostatically.46,52

Figure 9 Distribution of configurations
for the ternary complex consisting
of the crystal complex CcP–Cc (PDB: 2PCC) and an additional Cc molecule as a ligand.
In one simulation, the bound Cc is oxidized (A), and in the other,
it is reduced (B). The isosurfaces represent half the maximal density
of all orientations. The difference between the ensembles (Fe2+–Fe3+) is shown in (C), with the positive
and the negative isosurfaces colored blue and red, respectively. For
each simulation, the shortest heme-to-heme distance for the ligand
to the CcP is plotted vs the electrostatic interaction energy (D).
Another way to identify orientational changes is to analyze the population
of the various heme-to-heme distances from the ligand Cc to the complex
Cc as a function of the heme-to-heme distance of the ligand Cc to
CcP. In all distance mappings, the ensemble distribution seems to
have a clear edge at the top border. This edge is caused by the maximal
separation of the ligand and the receptor considered in the analysis
and is not a feature of the encounter complex (E).

Our simulation leads to a view that the oxidation
state in the
ternary complex influences the binding behavior of a second Cc molecule.
From our analysis, we would support a model in which two Cc molecules
bind at the same time. The binding is electrostatically favored and
even promotes the binding of Cc to the secondary binding site, while
for a consecutive binding, the interactions are slightly destabilized,
as long as an oxidized Cc molecule is still bound to CcP.

Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced the software suite MCMap and demonstrated
the usage of the software for mapping protein–protein interaction
of transient protein complexes highly depending on electrostatic interactions.
The software uses a rigid-body docking approach and is particularly
well-suited for analyzing transient protein complexes, for instance,
involved in electron-transfer processes. In MCMap, an MC method with
a ligand moving randomly in the electrostatic field of a receptor
is applied. Acceptance of MC moves and thereby weighting of the electrostatic
interaction energies is done according to the Metropolis MC criterion,
resulting in a Boltzmann distribution of states. This approach allows
for the identification of orientations that are energetically not
favored but still have a certain likelihood of occurrence. Recent
studies showed that also relatively high energy intermediates contribute
to the successful formation of a complex and that the complex formation
follows an energy path in an energy landscape containing specific
and nonspecific complexes.53 The obtained
ensemble covers a distribution of complexes which are characteristic
for transient protein complexes. In this way, MCMap covers not only
the surface regions of a receptor but maps also its adjacent surroundings
for interactions. The program comes with a variety of analysis options
which we demonstrate in this paper. These analysis tools help to relate
the simulation results to experimental data, which can then be explained
on a structural level. In particular, with PyCoALA, we present an
analysis method to rapidly link 2D contact histograms to 3D structures
of the receptor and the ligand. This tool allows for analyzing predicted
protein–protein interaction hot spots for their structural
properties. In the context of growing efforts to find drugs modulating
interactions between proteins, an application of such an analysis
strategy in a drug design context is conceivable. Furthermore, the
possibility to map the difference between two related simulations
to the protein surfaces provides insight in microscopic factors contributing
to an altered system behavior. Such an approach may find application
not only in the context of studying the impact of redox states on
the binding behavior. It may also provide more insights on the effect
of post-translational modifications or mutations on binding ensembles,
for instance, in gene regulation. In addition to the analysis demonstrated
herein of protein–protein interaction, MCMap is well-suited
to also analyze heavily charged molecules, such as DNA or RNA. MCMap
also opens the possibility to linearly scale up the mapping simulations.
In the way, MCMap saves orientations, and all MC runs are independent
of each other. By this means, MCMap can be executed multiple times
in parallel with the same parameters but different starting seeds
in order to get one big encounter ensemble. In the application to
the complex of CcP and Cc, we demonstrate how, for instance, the ionic
strength of the solution or oxidation states of proteins can influence
the binding. Moreover, our simulations suggest that a second Cc molecule
can be repelled by a bound Cc in the ternary complex. These results
give insights into how the complex formation is microscopically achieved
and how theoretical modeling can be used as a computational microscope
for a better understanding of experimental data.54

Materials and Methods
Preparation of the Protein Models
The structure of
the yeast complex Cc:CcP (PDB code: 2PCC, chain A and B)49 was used in our analysis. We used the fitting method CHELPG55 within ORCA56 (B3LYP,
def2-TZVP basis set) to derive partial charges for cofactor, which
were not part of the CHARMM27 force field.57 For Cc, we derived charges for a c-type heme, typically linked to
the protein by two cysteines and coordinated by histidine and methionine
in both states, reduced (Fe2+) and oxidized (Fe3+).

We added hydrogens and energy-minimized their position using
CHARMM36 with steepest descent and conjugate
gradient methods in cycles of 500 steps each. During minimization,
heavy atoms were kept fixed. The protonation states of all amino acids
were determined with titration studies using an in-house modified
version of MEAD58 and GMCT.59 The residues E11, D224, D235, and E267 in CcP
were found to be protonated at pH = 7 and were treated as such in
further analysis.

Calculation of the Electrostatic Potentials
Electrostatic
potentials were calculated using APBS.37 The ionic strength was set to 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mM. Relative
permittivity constants of 4 and 80 were used for the protein and the
solvent, respectively. For the MC simulation, the electrostatic potential
was represented on cubic grids with 225 grid points in each direction
and grid spacings of 2.0 and 1.0 Å for the coarse and the fine
grid, respectively. The temperature was set at 300 K. Radii of 1.4
and 2.0 Å were used for the solvent and the ions, respectively.

Simulation of Association Using MCMap
For protein–protein
docking, we used MCMap, our software for performing MC docking simulations
presented herein. We performed 104 runs with a total of
105 MC steps each for 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mM ionic strength.
The simulations were initiated with a center of mass separation of Rin = 130 Å between the receptor and the
ligand. A maximum center of mass separation of Rout = 180 Å was allowed. The MC run was reset after 50
consecutively rejected MC steps. The temperature was set to 300 K.
The electrostatic potential maps with grid spacings of 1 and 2 Å
were used as inner and outer potential grids, respectively. A maximal
displacement of 3 Å and a maximal rotation of 5 rad were used.
Calculations using OpenDX files (such as subtractions of densities)
were done using the tool DXMATH, which is a part of APBS.37

Analysis of the Simulation Results
For analyzing all
orientations of a simulation ensemble, print-coor was used. For generating
the contact map histograms, a distance of 8.0 Å was chosen. The
heme-to-heme distances were calculated with the subprogram min-dist,
which determines the minimal distance between two given structures
or structural elements. In order to compare MCMap runs with a different
number of orientations in the encounter ensemble, the histograms were
normalized to the total number of orientations. In this way, the histograms
can be subtracted from each other to identify differences. For a better
graphical representation, the histograms were scaled by the inverse
of the highest absolute value of the histogram to lead to a maximal
value of one for all histograms. For visualizing residues with major
differences in the contacts between two simulations, PyCoALA and PyMOL
were used.42
