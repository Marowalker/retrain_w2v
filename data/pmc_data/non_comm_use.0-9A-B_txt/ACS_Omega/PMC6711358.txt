Adjuvants are components of vaccine
that enhance the specific immune
response against co-inoculated antigens. Recently, we reported the
characterization of a synthetic sulfolipid named Sulfavant A (1) as a promising candidate of a novel class of molecular
adjuvants based on the sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerol skeleton. Here,
we report an improved synthesis of the sulfolipid scaffold, as well
as the preparation of two analogs named Sulfavant-S (2) and Sulfavant-R (3) with enhanced property to modulate
master immune targets such as human dendritic cells (DCs). According
to the present approach, synthesis of 1 is reduced from
14 to 11 steps with nearly triplication of the overall yield (11%).
The new members 2 and 3 elicit DC maturation
at a concentration of 10 nM, which is 1000 times more potent than
the parent molecule 1. Analysis of dynamic light scattering
indicates self-assembly of Sulfavants and formation of colloidal particles
with a small hydrodynamic radius (50 nm) for the epimers 2 and 3 and a larger radius (150 nm) for 1. The colloidal aggregates are responsible for the bell-shaped dose–response
curve of these products. We conclude that the particle size also affects
the equilibrium with free monomers, thus determining the effective
concentration of the sulfolipid molecule at the cellular targets and
the different immunological efficacy of 1–3. Sulfavants
(1–3) do not show in vitro cytotoxicity at concentrations
105 higher than the dose that triggers maximal immune response,
thus predicting a low level of toxicological risk in their formulation
in vaccines.

Introduction
Adjuvants
are aspecific components of vaccines that improve the
capacity of the immune system to build a long standing and efficient
response to antigens. Adjuvants achieve these effects through different
mechanisms, including modulation of T helper subsets.1−4 In the last years, there has been a considerable effort to introduce
a rational approach to the identification of novel adjuvants that
increase safety of vaccines and reinforce the immune response in weakened
immune patients.5−10

A major breakthrough of these studies has been the identification
of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the characterization
of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as convenient targets of novel
molecules or delivery systems.11 Sulfavant
A (1) is a synthetic sulfolipid that activates human
dendritic cells (DCs), a specific type of APCs that operate as master
regulators of the initiation of adaptive immune response. Exposure
of cultured DC to Sulfavant A (1) triggers the transformation
of DC to the “mature” stage with upregulation of T-cell
co-stimulatory factors (HLA-DR, CD83, CD86) and expression of specific
cytokine subsets (e.g., IL-12p40 and INF-γ).12 In mice, this process induced antigen-specific immunization
with antibody titers that are comparable to traditional adjuvants
(e.g., TiterMax). In agreement with these results, vaccination with
hgp10 peptide antigen and Sulfavant A elicited a protective response
with reduction of tumor growth and increase of survival in the murine
B16 melanoma model.12

Although the
mechanism has not been fully elucidated, activity
of Sulfavant A (1) is independent of toll-like receptor
2 and 4.12 This marks a clear difference
with other glycolipid adjuvants (e.g., monophosphoryl lipid A) currently
under investigation13−18 and suggests that the sulfoquinovosyl-glycerol backbone may be a
distinctive trait of a novel family of immunomodulators.19 The aim of the present study was the additional
characterization of the chemical determinants that affect the biological
activity of this group of molecular adjuvants, as well as the preparation
of new analogs with a higher immune efficacy. Here, we report a new
synthetic strategy of the sulfolipid scaffold and synthesis of two
epimers, named Sulfavant-S (2) and Sulfavant-R (3), that induce maturation and cytokine gene expression of
DCs at nanomolar concentrations. We also show that these compounds
form colloidal nanoparticle aggregates that are first responsible
of the difference in the cellular response to 1–3.

Results and Discussion
Sulfavant A (1)
is an epimeric mixture at C-2 (R/S
about 1.3:1) of β-sulfoquinovoside-distearoyl glycerol that
is prepared starting with acetylation of d-glucose, followed
by selective deacetylation of the anomeric hydroxyl group with benzylamine.
Coupling with 1,2-O-isopropylidene glycerol by trichloroacetimidate
methodology gave 3-O-(2′,3′,4′,6′-tetra-acetyl)-β-d-glucosyl-glycerol that was after derivatized by stearoyl groups
to obtain the key intermediate 1,2-distearoyl-3-O-β-d-glucosyl glycerol.12,19 In the original
work (route A of Scheme 1),12,19a sulfonation at carbon-6′ of glucose
was achieved by multiple steps of protection and deprotection that
affected negatively the overall synthetic yield. In order to overtake
this issue, we tested the direct sulfonation of the 6′-carbon
through an iodinate derivative in agreement with Traboni and co-workers.20

Scheme 1 Improved Synthesis of Sulfavant A (1)
With Sulfavant A (1), iodination of 1,2-distearoyl-3-O-β-d-glucosyl glycerol followed by conversion
to thioacetate reduced the number of steps from 14 to 11, as well
as triplicated the overall yield from 4 to 11.2% (route B of Scheme 1). The new approach
preserved the versatility of the original synthesis and was also tested
on the preparation of the two epimers Sulfavant S (2)
and Sulfavant R (3) from (S)- or (R)-1,2-O-isopropilidene glycerol, respectively
(Scheme 2).

h; If Not Stated Otherwise, Steps Are Identical to Those Described
in Ref (12)
As depicted in Scheme 2, the single stereoisomers
were both prepared with overall
yield higher than 10%. MS and NMR data of the two new products were
identical to Sulfavant A (1) in all aspects but for the
signals of the protons H2-1 that fall at δ 4.40 (1H,
dd, J = 2.7, 12.0 Hz, H-1a) and 4.24 (1H, dd, J = 6.9, 12.0 Hz, H-1b) in the S epimer (2)
and at δ 4.45 (1H, dd, J = 2.6, 12.1 Hz, H-1a)
and 4.17 (1H, dd, J = 6.7, 12.1 Hz, H-1b) in the
R epimer (3) (Figure 1). While the stereochemistry of 3 is preserved
throughout the sequence of reactions, synthesis of 2 showed
a partial epimerization of C-2 due to the diastereoselective opening
and subsequent closure of the acetonide during the coupling step.
Therefore, Sulfavant S (2) was composed of a mixture
of 4:1 S/R diastereomers at C-2 of glycerol (Scheme 2) and, in this respect, it was similar to
Sulfavant A (1) but with a different diastereomeric ratio
(S/R about 1:1.3).

Figure 1 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD/CDCl3 1/1)
spectra of 1–3. Partial epimerization of Sulfavant
S (2) is clearly detectable by the presence of the double
doublets at 4.45 and 4.17 ppm due to the R epimer.

The new analogs up-regulated expression of the
maturation markers
HLA-DR, CD83, and CD86 at 10 nM (Figure 2). This was drastically different from the
reported response to Sulfavant A (1) that triggers clear
differentiation only of the CD83 + DC population at 10 μM.12 The activity of both epimers decreased at the
higher concentrations even if Sulfavant S (2) stimulated
residual overexpression of CD83 in the whole range. CD83 is highly
expressed on mature DCs and is not detectable in other APCs that do
not prime naive T cells. Thus, CD83 + DCs are considered a hallmark
of the ability to prime a protective T cell response and have a profound
clinical implication for vaccines against many widespread infectious
diseases, including HIV-AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, or for therapeutic
treatment of cancers.11

of maturation phenotyping markers (HLA-DR,
CD86, CD83) in moDCs stimulated with (A) Sulfavant A
(1), (B) Sulfavant S (2), and
(C) Sulfavant R (3) at concentrations of
0.01, 0.1, and 10 μM; gray = isotype control; dark gray = unstimulated
cells; orange = stimulated.

After 24 h, compounds 2 and the 3 also
enhanced IL-12p40 gene expression (Figure 3) and no effect on expression of IL-10. IL-12
is a pro-inflammatory cytokine released by DC in response to infection
of bacteria and virus,21,22 whereas IL-10 downregulates immune
and inflammatory response and mediates many of the tolerogenic effects
exerted by DCs.23,24 On the whole, the effect of 2 and 3 on these cytokines is qualitatively similar
to the results previously reported with Sulfavant-A (1) even if the new analogs 2 and 3 gave
a maximal activation at 10 nM, whereas 1 showed the strongest
effect only at 10 μM.12 As previously
noted for the surface markers, IL-12p40 expression decreased with
the increase of the concentration of both epimers and only 2 conserved a residual activity at 10 μM. Compounds 1–3 did not show toxic activity on DCs and other primary cells at concentration
up to 105 times higher than the effective dose (Supporting Information Figure S5).

increasing dose of Sulfavants 1–3. Asterisks indicate
significant differences from the control group at a 95% (P < 0.05) confidence level, as determined using two-way ANOVA analysis.

These tests indicate that 1–3 are all safe
DC activators but also underline a divergent response that correlates
with stereochemical aspects, as the diastereomixture 2 (S/R 4:1) and the diastereopure 3 are significantly
more potent than their epimeric mixture 1 (S/R about
1:1.3). As reported by diagnostic expression of CD83 (Figure 4A), efficacy of single epimers 2 and 3 did not increase sigmoidally with concentration
but followed a typical “bell-shaped” curve with decrease
of activity above 10 nM. A similar response is also observable with
Sulfavant A (1) but only at a concentration higher than
10 μM. Bell-shaped dose–response curves are not the rule
but several drugs show this behavior. Recently, occurrence of colloidal
species has been related to the biological response of these products.25 Colloidal properties are also reported to affect
biological activity26−29 and chemical reactivity30 of sulfoquinovosides
in aqueous or polar environment.

of particles of 1–3 in aqueous suspension at 0.2
mM as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) on three independent
measurements. Red = Sulfavant A (1); blue = Sulfavant
S (2); green = Sulfavant R (3).

DLS is commonly used for the analysis of supramolecular
lipid aggregation.31Figure 4B shows the hydrodynamic radius of the aggregates
of 1–3 at 0.2 mM in Milli-Q water as measured
by DLS.
Sulfavant S (2) and R (3) have a smaller
hydrodynamic radius (around 50 nm), whereas the self-aggregation of
Sulfavant A (1) led to vesicles of 150 nm with higher
size dispersity. Surface tension measurements performed with Sulfavant
A, S, and R (1–3) further highlighted the marked
difference between the aggregation behaviors of these molecules. Indeed,
analysis of the surface tension as a function of concentrations of 1–3 showed a different slope in the premicellar region
with indication of a minimum surface area per molecule (Amin) larger for Sulfavant A (1) than for Sulfavant S (2) and R (3).

These data proved a different
supramolecular organization among 1–3 in water,
as well as a remarkable parallelism between
self-aggregation behavior and biological response. In agreement with
Shoichet and co-workers,25 we suggest that
formation of colloidal particles of Sulfavants reduces the activity
because it affects the effective concentration of the free sulfolipids
at the target site. In line with this view, we suggest that the concentration
of free monomers is higher with the small colloidal aggregates made
by the epimers 2 and 3, whereas it is lower
with the larger aggregates of Sulfavant A (1) (Figure 5). With the increase
of the concentration, the size of both colloid particles change and
the monomers are tied up, thus leading to the bell-shaped curves measured
experimentally around 10 nM with 2 and 3 and around 10 μM with 1.

Figure 5 Representation of the
proposed colloidal mechanism of action of
Sulfavants. Self-association of the sulfolipids into colloidal particles
depends on diasteropurity of the organic molecules. With epimers 2 and 3 (left side), the concentration of free
monomers in equilibrium with small aggregates is high and the products
occupy effectively the receptor target at very low dose (EC50 10 nM). With the increase of the concentration, there is a gradual
loss of the activity leading to a typical bell-shaped dose response
curve that we attribute to occurrence of larger colloidal nanoparticles.
The epimeric mixture 1 (right side) produces large aggregates
that are able to hold the monomers, thus reducing the effective concentration
of the monomers and the biological potency (EC50 10 μM).
Increase of the concentration of 1 induces loss of activity
for the formation of very large aggregates that cannot interact with
the cell target in an effective manner. At the moment, we have no
direct cue to explain the dependence of the size of the colloidal
aggregates on the diastereomeric purity of the glycerol center. However,
it is reasonable that the presence of both epimers can break the symmetry
of the packing of the alkyl chains, thus leading to less dense and
less tightly packed structures.

Conclusions
Modern vaccines are no longer made with inactivated
or attenuated
pathogens, indeed they use pathogen-related proteins obtained by molecular
biology techniques. Therefore, all vaccines require adjuvants to stimulate
innate immune cells or additional receptors on lymphocytes such as
complement receptors.32 Here, we report
an enhancement of the synthesis and activity of immunomodulatory compounds
based on the sulfoquinovoside-glycerol skeleton. The two new analogs,
Sulfavant S (2) and Sulfavant R (3), trigger
maturation of the innate immune DCs at 10 nM, which is 3 orders of
magnitude lower than the prototype molecule Sulfavant A (1). The increase of the biological potency correlates with the assembling
of different colloidal particles that is dependent on diasteropurity
of 1–3. We suggest that epimers 2 and 3 can form aggregates smaller and less “cohesive”,
thus in equilibrium with a “more effective” fraction
of monomers that can freely diffuse and interact with cell targets.
The colloid hypothesis also well explains the bell-shaped dose–response
curve that seems to be typical of this family of compounds. Notably,
it has been already reported that stereochemical characteristics can
determine the supramolecular organization of amphipathic substances
and change the biological activity by interfering with interaction
and binding affinity with protein and cellular structures.33−37 DCs are emerging as a critical cell type in controlling the immune
response; therefore, the stimulation of DC by Sulfavants must be considered
a promising feature to generate therapeutic vaccines and, in view
of in vivo tests, the formation of stable self-aggregates and the
absence of in vitro toxic effects are predictive of a low level of
toxicological risk.

Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures
NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE-400 (400.13 MHz). HR-MS spectra were acquired by
a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific). TLC plates (Kieselgel 60 F254) and silica
gel powder (Kieselgel 60, 0.063–0.200 mm) were from Merck.

All the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without
any further purification. DLS measurements were performed with a home-made
instrument composed by a Photocor compact goniometer, an SMD 6000
Laser Quantum 50 mW light source operating at 5325 Å, a photomultiplier
(PMT-120-OP/B), and a correlator (Flex02-01D, correlator.com). The
surface tension of aqueous Sulfavant samples was measured with a Sigma
70 tensiometer (KSV, Stockholm, Sweden) using the Du Noüy ring
method.

1,2-Distearoyl-3-O-[(2′,3′,4′-tri-acetyl-6′-thioacetyl)-β-D-glucosyl]-R/S-glycerol (5)
1,2-distearoyl-3-O-[(2′,3′,4′-tri-acetyl-6′-iodo)-β-d-glucosyl]-glycerol (4) (170 mg, 0.166 mmol) was
dissolved in 2-butanone (15 mL) and potassium thioacetate (94 mg,
0.830 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 2
h, and then, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The
resulting material was purified by silica gel chromatography using
a light petroleum ether/diethyl ether gradient to give 1,2-distearoyl-3-O-[(2′,3′,4′-tri-acetyl-6′-thioacetyl)-β-d-glucosyl]-glycerol (161 mg, 0.166 mmol, 100%) as a colorless

Characterization
of Colloidal Nanoparticles
After purification
by high-performance liquid chromatography, samples were prepared in
1 mL of Millipore water at 0.2 mM (170 μg) of each compound.
After sonication for 40 min at 35 °C, the solutions were maintained
at room temperature (20 °C) for 24 h. The mean diffusion coefficient
was obtained as an average of at least three measurements at 25 °C.
Stability of the systems over time (1 week) was systematically controlled
by the reproducibility of the diffusion coefficients.
