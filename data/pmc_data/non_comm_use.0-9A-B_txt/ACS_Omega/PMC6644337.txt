The
activation process of carbon–iodine (C–I) bond
on neutral and cationic niobium metcars (Nb8C12) is investigated using density functional theory and related computational
techniques. Metallocarbohedrenes or metcars are a class of stable
metal–carbide clusters of specific stoichiometry and of great
interest to cluster chemists since their first discovery. The detailed
reaction mechanism along with the overall energy profile of the C–I
dissociation reaction on niobium metcar and its cations is presented
in this paper. The tunneling-corrected rate constants and their related
reaction parameters such as the pre-exponential factor are also included
alongside. The major differences between the reaction mechanism of
the neutral and cationic metcars are also highlighted as well. Despite
the available experimental results, the C–I bond dissociation
on metcars has remained an unexplored problem in the theoretical and
computational domains. Thus, the present investigation can fill in
the gap and may also provide new insights provoking further developments
in cluster and materials chemistry in future.

1 Introduction
In
the realm of inorganic and materials chemistry, atomic clusters
are small-sized multiatomic particles with variable composition and
unique properties. Being the only link between the atoms and the bulk
materials known to mankind till date, atomic clusters have been the
prime motif of material investigation since past four or five decades.
Throughout all these years, both theoretical and experimental investigations
have not only enriched the respective research fields with interesting
outcomes but also introduced the scientific community to a vast new
domain of material chemistry which was never explored before. Starting
from the concept of the third dimension of the periodic table as alternate
building blocks1−3 to novel motifs with fascinating magnetic, optical,
and catalytic properties,4−19 the studies in the field of clusters are no short of captivating
outcomes for practical manifestation in near future. In spite of these
promises, there lies a major complication to incorporate these marvelous
ideas into reality. Most atomic clusters are usually metastable and
highly reactive in nature and therefore can only be synthesized in
vacuum or inert atmosphere. Hence, past few years have seen a substantial
increment in the number of experimental or theoretical research focused
on the stabilization of nanoclusters.8,20−22 Beginning with the concept of jellium shell closure23,24 in either pristine or impure clusters, rigid matrix-based stabilization
to the implementation of superatomic complex theory,8,20−22,25,26 it is fortuitous that cluster chemists now have an entire set of
arsenal for stabilizing the metastable clusters to some extent just
enough to make them suitable for small-scale experimental manifestation.
In addition to that, the added insights by the latest theoretical
developments have further enhanced the in-depth understanding of the
stabilization process of nanoclusters, resulting in new types of artificial
stable motifs. However, beside the new developments, at this point,
it is also important to recollect the fact that although somewhat
rare, there are a few classes of clusters which are naturally stable.
One of the most well-known examples of these types is the family of
fullerenes, the first prototype (i.e., C60) of which was
invented in 1985 at Rice University.27,28 The legacy
of fullerenes which followed soon after the innovation and their impact
on modern materials science is certainly a familiar topic to every
material chemists. However, fullerenes are not the only species that
can be classified as stable clusters. The second example of similar
carbon-containing stable clusters is the metallocarbohedrenes, discovered
by Castleman and co-workers29−31 nearly 7 years after the innovation
of C60. Metallocarbohedrenes, commonly abbreviated as “metcar”
is a class of stable metal carbide clusters with chemical stoichiometry
M8C12, where “M” is usually an
early “d” block element. The presence of first metcar
(Ti8C12+) was detected as a dominant
“supermagic” peak much similar to that
of C60 in the mass spectrum during an attempt to dehydrogenate
hydrocarbons by titanium metal.29 Related
experiments soon established the fact that the term “metcar”
indicates an entire class of clusters including binary ones, rather
than a single entity.30,32−35 This captivating innovation paved
the ground for new studies including physical and chemical properties,
reactivities, and structural characterizations including bonding and
stability of individual metcars.36−54 The most remarkable among these is definitely the structural characterization
of titanium metcar (Ti8C12). On the basis of
the stoichiometry of the cluster as obtained from the mass spectrometry,
the initial structural prediction of Ti8C12 was
a regular dodecahedron with Th symmetry, similar to that of C20 fullerene.29−31 This speculated structure was definitely a logical choice, primarily
because of two separate reasons. First, as the total atom count of
both Ti8C12 and C20 is the same,
the Ti8C12 cluster can be considered a derivative
of C20 simply by replacing two carbon atoms from each pentagonal
ring by titanium keeping the skeleton intact. Second , the reaction
of polar molecules with Ti8C12 and V8C12 results in the adsorption of upto eight molecules,
which signifies that all the eight metal sites are equivalent by coordination
and also that the regular dodecahedron structure is among the five
platonic solids, all of which are very well-known abundant stable
structures, often preferred by nature. However, theoretical calculations
showed the possibility of two different structures which are of D2d and Td symmetry, and they were found to be lower
in energy than the Th symmetric structure proposed earlier.55−61 Detailed investigations in this regard soon established the fact
that the theoretical calculations are indeed correct, and the distorted Td structure is confirmed to
be the ground state geometry, later verified by experiments.62

Aside from the structural characterization
of metcars, the chemical
response of the clusters also attracts considerable attention of chemists
since their first discovery. Reaction with polar (e.g., H2O, CH3OH, NH3, and (CH3)2CO) as well as non-polar molecules (e.g., benzene, methane, and ethylene)
is studied in-depth and also supported by theoretical calculations.36,41−43,45,63−65 The studies with non-polar molecules are of special
importance because it is observed that only a maximum of four non-polar
molecules can be attached with a single metcar. This observation indirectly
proves the existence of two separate set of metal sites in the cluster,
thus confirming the tetrahedral-shaped ground state consisting of
a smaller inner tetrahedron surrounded by a larger outer tetrahedron
each composed with four metal atoms around each vertices. These investigations
further elucidate the reactivity trend of different metcars, and it
is observed that the titanium metcar cation is more chemically stable
compared to the vanadium or niobium metcar cations which are found
to be more reactive in comparison. The difference in reactivity in-between
different metcars is also observed in the dissociation reaction of
carbon–halogen bond using metcar as a catalyst.62,66 Upon using methyl iodide as the reactant, experimental observation
reveals that while Ti8C12+ is only
able to abstract single halogen atom from CH3I, the vanadium
and niobium metcar cations are able to form bonds with multiple number
of iodine atoms. Even both these metcar cations are able to dissociate
much stronger halocarbon bonds such as C–Br and C–Cl
and also form bonds with multiple number of chlorine and bromine atoms.
Throughout all these years, studies on metcars have still remained
popular and investigations regarding hydrogen storage67−71 or related to the synthesis of novel materials72,73 are still widely available in the modern literature.

The oxidative
dissociation of carbon–halogen bond is one
of the pivotal reaction steps in common chemistry, especially, because
carbon–iodine (C–I) bond dissociation is one of the
major intermediate steps of the coupling reactions which are among
the very few techniques available to organic chemists which results
in the direct formation of the important C–C bond.74 Because of this reason, a significant portion
of recent investigations has solely been focused on the understanding
of detailed mechanisms including thermodynamic and kinetic data of
carbon–halogen bond dissociation. Aside from the most commonly
used catalysts75,76 such as palladium, platinum,
and nickel, in-depth theoretical and experimental studies on more
unconventional materials such as gold77,78 and even aluminum
clusters5 are also available. However,
to the best of our knowledge, no such theoretical investigation encompassing
the reaction mechanism and other related aspects of C–I activation
on metcars has been carried out earlier. The present paper includes
such a theoretical investigation of C–I dissociation on niobium
metcars using density functional theory (DFT) as a computational tool
of choice. The calculated results are analyzed and compared with the
earlier experimental results available in the literature. The next
section (section 2)
contains the computational details of the calculations presented in
the paper. Section 3 includes the results and discussion regarding the thermodynamic
and kinetic data of C–I dissociation on both neutral and cationic
niobium metcars in addition to other associated calculations. Section 4 concludes the article.

2 Computational Details
The initial guess geometry of
tetrahedral Nb8C12 is taken from the Td symmetric metcar structure
reported in the earlier literature.55−61 The neutral and the cationic structures of Nb–metcar are
optimized by assigning different spin multiplicities using both M06-2X
and B3LYP functional using Triple Zeta Valence Plus Polarization (TZVP)
basis for “C” atoms and LANL2DZ-ECP basis for niobium.
It is observed that with both the functionals, the neutral and cationic
Nb8C12 clusters with minimum spin multiplicity
are lowest in energy (see Supporting Information). As organic molecules containing C–I bond, we have chosen
three common molecules similar to our earlier works.79,80 The pre-reaction complexes (P.R.Cs) are derived by attaching the
R–I molecule in all possible sites within the cluster, and
only the lowest energy conformer is considered in each case. Similar
to the neutral and cationic metcars, all the P.R.Cs are further optimized
incorporating different spin multiplicities to identify the lowest
energy conformer, which is found to be of minimum spin as earlier.
The binding energies of R–I molecule with Nb8C12 and Nb8C12+ metcars are
calculated by the following formula 1  

All the optimizations included in the present
paper are performed
using the Berny optimization method in Gaussian 09.81 The normal modes of vibration in all the optimized structures
are scrutinized, and it is made sure that all normal modes of vibration
are real for global minima, whereas only one significant imaginary
frequency that corresponds to the C–I bond is present in the
case of the first-order saddle points (transition states). Intrinsic
reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations are further performed for the
transition states, and it is verified that the IRC path properly connects
to the complexes on both sides of the saddle point. The condensed
Fukui indices (fA+) at each
stationary point of the overall reaction coordinate are calculated
using Hirshfeld population analysis using M06-2X functional. The condensed
Fukui indices for the nucleophilic attack of an atom “A”
within a molecule containing a subtotal of “N” electron
are expressed as 2  where qA,N+1 and qA,N are
the Hirshfeld population of atom A in the (N + 1)
and N electronic molecular systems, respectively,
both having the same equilibrium geometry. All the thermodynamic parameters
and related data presented in the paper are calculated in 298.15 K
temperature and 1 atm pressure. The classical as well as Wigner tunneling-corrected
rate constants (denoted as TST and TSTW, respectively) and other associated
kinetic data are calculated using an open source Kinetic and Statistical
Thermodynamical Package (KiSThelP).82 The
classical rate constant, that is, kTST is defined as 3  and the expression for the Wigner tunneling-corrected
rate constant (kTSTW) is 4  where
all the included terms have their usual
significance. χ(T) is the transmission coefficient
which is calculated by the imaginary frequency of the unbound mode
at the respective saddle point 5  

The three
parametric Arrhenius equation is defined as83 6  where A is the pre-exponential
factor, and “n” is a constant. The
other used terms have their usual significance. The deformation density
plot is constructed by subtracting the respective three-dimensional
density data of the complex from its individual components. The bond
polarity index (BPI) and the atoms in molecules (AIM) analysis are
performed by an open source Multiwfn package84 utilizing the output file obtained from the Gaussian 09 package.
The common definition of BPI of a bond between atom “A”
and “B” within a molecule is given as85,86 7  

The EIA and EIB terms
denote the energy index
(EI) of respective atoms within the molecule, and EIref terms are the EI obtained from homonuclear reference molecules of
atoms A and B. The definition of EI of an atom “A” within
a molecule is presented as 8  where Θi,A signifies the composition
of atom A in the ith
molecular orbital (MO). ηi and εi are the occupation number and energy of
the ith MO, respectively. The summation of eq 8 only runs over all the
valence MOs. The Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) are calculated for individual
geometries as well as geometries along the IRC path as required using
the NBO 3.1 package87 as implemented in
Gaussian 09.

3 Results and Discussion
To acquire a brief understanding of the C–I bond dissociation
process on neutral and cationic Nb8C12 clusters,
both the structures were first optimized using an appropriate guess
structure as a starting point. The global minima for both neutral
and cationic Nb8C12 are found to be slightly
distorted from the ideal tetrahedral structure. This observation is
indeed consistent and can be confirmed from the earlier studies on
other metcars as well.88 By comparing the
optimized (M06-2X) structures of both Nb8C12 and Nb8C12+ metcars with the standard Td symmetric reference structure
reveals that the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) are 0.139 and
0.146 Å, respectively. The RMSD value within the neutral and
cationic Nb8C12 clusters is found to be much
smaller 0.0246 Å, signifying a small structural deviation in-between
the neutral and the cationic Nb metcars. As already mentioned, three
very common organic compounds with variable C–I bond strength,
namely, methyl (−CH3), vinyl (−C2H3), and phenyl (−C6H5) iodide,
are chosen for the study. Except CH3I, which is the only
one with experimental validation,5 the
choice of other two iodides is completely arbitrary and included only
to ensure enough variation in the calculated results because of their
uneven bond strength. The bond dissociation enthalpy (ΔH298K0 in kcal/mol) order of these three iodides is observed to be89  

Thus, the C–I
bond in phenyl
iodide is the strongest where
methyl iodide can be considered as the weakest among the three. These
variations in the bond dissociation energies among the iodides are
expected to influence the computed reaction parameters which in turn
may provide more insights into the C–I dissociation process
on both the metcars. All the necessary thermodynamic and kinetic data
presented in this paper are evaluated for all three iodides by using
three different DFT functionals. However, for specific mechanistic
related discussions, we have solely restricted ourselves with the
results obtained for CH3I in M06-2X functional. The major
reason of this choice is twofold. First, as already mentioned,
methyl iodide is the only organoiodide with available experimental
results. Second, Minnesota functionals such as M06-2X are very well-known
for their superior performance in determining accurate molecular structures
and activation barrier and even can take care of small-to-medium range
dispersion effects.90−92 Hence, the structure and thermochemical parameters
included in the figures also consist solely of results obtained from
the M06-2X functional if not stated otherwise.

3.A Account
of Reaction Mechanism
The
overall energy landscape of C–I bond dissociation of all three
iodides on Nb8C12 and Nb8C12+ metcars is depicted in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
The thermodynamic parameters calculated using three different functionals
are enlisted in Tables 1 and 2 as well. As predicted, the first step
of the reaction is the formation of P.R.C via the adsorption of an
R–I molecule on the surface of the metcar. Because of the dual
tetrahedral structure of the metcar, the incoming R–I molecule
can either attach itself with Nb atoms located in either inner (Nbi) or outer (Nbo) tetrahedra. DFT investigations
indicate that the P.R.C in which the R–I molecule is attached
with Nbo is more thermodynamically stable than the other
structure. The electronic energy difference between the two structures
in M06-2X functional is calculated to be about 6 kcal/mol for the
attachment of CH3I on neutral Nb8C12. The binding energies (Tables 1 and 2) of the R–I molecules
on both neutral and cationic metcars are also found to be quite significant,
possibly because of energetically favorable orbital matching between
iodine and niobium resulting in higher stability. Comparing with other
results available in the current literature, the calculated binding
energies are found to be much higher than that of the small-sized
neutral aluminum cluster79 and also than
most of the neutral and cationic gold clusters78 of similar size range (3 ≤ n ≤
20). It is interesting to observe that the binding energies of R–I
molecules with Nb8C12+ are relatively
higher (about ∼6 kcal/mol) than the neutral metcar. To understand
these discrepancies, we have studied the formation process and the
characteristic of the newly formed Nb–I bond in both the clusters.
The top panels of Figure 3a,b depict the snapshots of deformation density plots of the
initial approach of the CH3I molecule toward the neutral
and cationic clusters, respectively. From the plots, it is pretty
evident that there exist slight differences in the bond formation
process of CH3I with Nb metcar and its cation. In the case
of neutral Nb8C12 (Figure 3a), it is observed that a significant amount
of charge density is accommodated around the R–I molecule.
As a result, the formation of Nb–I bond results from the major
contribution of iodine atom and the Nbo atom of the metcar
provides minor contribution as a donor. However, when the system is
cationic (Figure 3b),
it can be seen that the electron density around the incoming iodine
atom is widely depleted and in this case, the Nbo atom
acts as the major donor to form the bond with the iodine atom. These
variations in the bond formation process of R–I with neutral
and cationic metcars create a difference in the ionic nature of both
bonds, and the resulting bond in the cationic metcar shows higher
binding energy because of its high ionic character. This conclusion
is further confirmed via the calculation of BPI in M06-2X functional.
The BPI is a direct representation of the polarity of a chemical bond
in terms of numerics rather than simple visualization, allowing quantitative
characterization of the type of that particular bond in the process.
Calculation of BPI of Nb–I bond for both metcars reveals that
the BPINb–I of [Nb8C12···ICH3] is higher (−0.118 a.u.) than the BPINb–I obtained for [Nb8C12···ICH3]+ complex (−0.154 a.u.). The lower (more
negative) value of BPINb–I bond in [Nb8C12···ICH3]+ complex
indicates that the Nb–I bond in the cationic complex is more
ionic in nature than its neutral counterpart. The bond order of Nb–I
in the cationic P.R.C is also observed to be slightly higher than
that in the neutral P.R.C. Thus, while the WBI of the Nb–I
bond in [Nb8C12···ICH3] complex is found to be 0.59, the WBINb–I for
the same in the cationic complex is observed to be slightly higher
(0.70). As expected, the calculated WBIs of the newly formed Nb–I
bond indicate that they are indeed partial in nature in both neutral
and cationic P.R.Cs, signifying that the bond formation process is
not yet complete. It is also important to mention that although the
binding energies of the R–I molecule differ because of the
nature of the newly formed Nbo–I bond on the Nb8C12 and Nb8C12+ metcars, the binding energy values seem nearly invariant on the
type of the “R” group attached with iodine. Thus, for
both the neutral and cationic Nb metcars, the binding energies for
all three R–I molecules are observed to be very close, as evident
from the rightmost column of Tables 1 and 2.

From the reaction coordinates as depicted in Figures 1 and 2, it is observed
that the overall reaction pathway toward the most thermodynamically
stable product is not as simple as that expected from the first glance.
Although the dissociation of the C–I bond is found to be a
one-step process goes via the first transition state (TS-1), DFT investigations
indicate that the resulting C–I dissociated complex ([A]) is
certainly not the most thermodynamically stable postreaction complex.
There exists a possibility of another postreaction complex [B] along
the reaction coordinate which is thermodynamically more stable than
complex [A] and connected with [A] via a second transition state (TS-2).
Thus, the overall reaction pathway for each individual R–I
molecule must be characterized by two separate activation barriers
ΔEa1 and ΔEa2, as presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The existence
of two separate postreaction complexes along the reaction coordinate
may seem baffling at first look, but the explanation of this observation
is rather simple and can be provided by recollecting the structure
of the cluster itself. As mentioned earlier, because of the tetrahedral
structure of metcars, the metal atoms present on the surface can be
classified into two separate categories (inner (Nbi) and
outer (Nbo) for our present case) based on the coordination
of the metal atoms. Attaching the dissociated “–R”
functional group with each types of Nb atoms yields two separate postreaction
complexes with different thermodynamic stabilities. Hence, for each
iodide, the TS-1 leads to the cleavage of C–I bond from the
P.R.C, resulting in simultaneous attachment of the dissociated R group
to the nearest Nbi atom (structure [A] in Figures 1 and 2). The second reaction step starts from the resulting complex [A]
and directs toward the most thermodynamically stable postreaction
complex. This proceeds via TS-2 which involves a direct intracluster
migration of the R group from the Nbi atom to the Nbo atom via a three-membered transition state. The final structure
(structure [B] in Figures 1 and 2) where the “R”
functional group is attached to the Nbo atom is observed
to be the most thermodynamically stable postreaction complex within
the whole reaction coordinate. Thus, structure [A] serves as an intermediate
between the TS-1 and TS-2, which connects with the stable postreaction
complex [B]. The enthalpy difference (ΔH) between
[A] and [B] is observed to be 24.6 and 18.3 kcal/mol for the reaction
of MeI on neutral and cationic Nb8C12, respectively.
Structure [C] shown in both Figures 1 and 2 is the dissociated postreaction
complex as included in the corresponding experimental paper.62 The dissociated complex [C] is observed to be
energetically closure with [A] than [B] for each iodide. Also from Figures 1 and 2, it is observed that the gaps (both ΔH and ΔG) with either [A] or [B] complex with
[C] are found to be higher in the cationic systems than that in the
neutral ones. The increments are usually found to be ∼10 kcal/mol
for the ΔH and ΔG separation
between [A] and [C] and ∼4–7 kcal/mol for the ΔH and ΔG separation between [B] and
[C]. This whole reaction coordinate is further confirmed by IRC calculations. Figure 4 collects two sample
IRC plots for both steps of the reaction between CH3I and
Nb8C12 clusters in M06-2X functional. The resulting
changes of the bond lengths of specific preselected bonds along the
IRC are also presented in Figure 4b,d. As can be seen from Figure 4a,c, both the transition states properly
connect with the predicted chemical species on both positive and negative
sides of their respective IRCs. Thus, the TS-1 connects to the P.R.C
on the negative direction of the IRC and smoothly converges to complex
[A] on the positive direction of the IRC (Figure 4a). The next reaction step is confirmed by
a second IRC calculation included in Figure 4c. The TS-2 also connects with complex [A]
on the left-hand side and converges to the thermodynamically stable
complex [B] on the positive direction of the IRC. Similar conclusion
can be drawn from the other calculated IRCs on both neutral and cationic
Nb–metcars, thus validating the reliability of the results.

3.B Account
of Thermodynamics and Kinetics
As mentioned earlier, the
thermodynamic parameters regarding TS-1
and TS-2 and also the exothermicity values in M06-2X, B3LYP, and BHandHLYP
functionals are enlisted in Tables 1 and 2. The overall range of
both the activation barriers (ΔG⧧) in all three DFT functionals is found to be varied from low to
medium range (∼4.6–26 kcal/mol), ensuring decent catalytic
activity of the metcar on the C–I bond. A close look of the
first activation barrier (ΔEa1)
reveals that for all three iodides and in all three functionals, the
cationic Nb8C12 shows lower activation barrier
than the neutral one, which signifies the higher catalytic activity
of Nb8C12+ compared to Nb8C12 toward the dissociation of C–I bond. The ΔEa1 values calculated for Nb8C12+ are observed to be often comparable with the
activation barrier obtained for the case of small-sized aluminum clusters.79 The lowest first activation barrier is calculated
to be ΔG⧧ = 4.65 kcal/mol,
which is obtained in BHandHLYP functional for the oxidative addition
of C6H5I on Nb8C12+. As a matter of fact, the Ea1
obtained for C6H5I in all three functionals
is observed to be the lowest among all three iodides, whereas the
activation barriers calculated for CH3I and H2C=CHI are usually either in close proximity with each other
or one is higher than the other without any predictable patterns.
The result is interesting because the C–I bond in C6H5I has the maximum dissociation energy among the three
iodides. The observed low activation barrier of Nb8C12+ compared to the neutral metcar can be justified
by the calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/singly
occupied molecular orbital (SOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) gaps of the respective metcar. The SOMO–LUMO
gap of Nb8C12+ is found to be 2.47
eV (1.03 eV in B3LYP), which is lower by 0.3 eV compared to the HOMO–LUMO
gap obtained for the neutral metcar (2.77 eV in M06-2X and 1.25 in
B3LYP functional). The lower energy gap signifies slightly high reactivity
of the cationic metcar over the neutral one and thus explains the
trend obtained in the calculated activation barrier. The variation
of the activation barriers can be viewed in a more prominent way by
looking at the respective rate constants for Nb8C12 and Nb8C12+ presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. As already mentioned in the computational
details, the rate constants included in the present paper are calculated
using two different methods, the classical transition state theory
(TST) and the Wigner tunneling corrected version of classical transition
state theory (TSTW). The calculated rate constants are also associated
with pre-exponential factor (A) and the constant
(n) in accordance with the three-parameter Arrhenius
equation. From Tables 3 and 4, it is observed that the value of temperature-dependent
constant (n) of the three-parametric Arrhenius equation
is found to be usually higher (>1) for the first reaction barrier,
whereas for the second reaction barrier, the values of “n” lie below 1 and in one specific case a small negative
value close to zero is also observed. From theoretical perspective,
the higher value of “n” for the first
reaction barrier signifies that the first reaction barrier of C–I
dissociation on both Nb8C12 and Nb8C12+ is more sensitive on the temperature than
the second barrier. The exothermicity values (which is the enthalpy
difference between the complex [B] and the P.R.C) listed in Tables 1 and 2 are observed to be really high, ranging within ∼−70
to −81 kcal/mol for neutral Nb8C12 and
within ∼−60 to −75 kcal/mol for Nb8C12 cation as calculated for all three iodides and using
the three different DFT functionals.

To gain further insights into the overall reaction
mechanism, we
have presented additional calculations in this research article. One
of such calculations included in Figure 5a,b represents the change of the WBI of selected
bonds in the natural atomic orbital (NAO) basis along the IRC of the
TS-1 of both neutral and cationic Nb8C12. The
WBIs of both the dissociated C–I bond as well as newly forming
Nbo–I bond are included in the figure. The crossover
point, that is, where the bond indices of both the breaking and newly
forming bonds are become equal to each other, is also clearly shown
in Figure 5a,b. Figure 5a shows that for
neutral Nb8C12 the WBI promptly converges from
∼1 in the P.R.C to nearly zero at the end of the corresponding
plot. At the same time, the Nbo–I bond index starts
to increase from 0.6 in the P.R.C and finally proceed toward a WBI
value of 1.23 in complex [A]. In a similar fashion, according to Figure 5b, in cationic Nb8C12, the WBI of the C–I bond decreases from
∼1 and converges toward zero, whereas in the case of the newly
formed Nbo–I bond, the WBI starts to increase from
a value of 0.7 in the P.R.C and finally converges toward the value
of 1.46 as calculated in [A]. The observed higher bond order of Nbo–I as obtained in complex [A] of cationic Nb8C12 can again be attributed to the ionic character of
the respective bond as described earlier. In Figure 6, we have included the change of the Fukui
function (f+) (Figure 6a,b) and the HOMO–LUMO or SOMO–LUMO
gap (Figure 6c,d) along
the reaction pathway for the reaction of CH3I with Nb8C12 and Nb8C12+. The major differences of the C–I dissociation process on
both neutral and cationic Nb–metcars are evident from all the
four plots (Figure 6a–d). The dissimilarities are especially prominent at the
position of TS-1 in comparison to other portions of the plots. Focusing
first on the change of f+ along the reaction
pathway, it can be seen that at the position of TS-1, the trend of f+ values of Nbo and the attached
I atom follows an opposite pattern in the neutral Nb–metcar
compared to the cation. Thus, in neutral Nb8C12, the f+ value of the I atom shows a
large increment and the respective f+ value
of the Nbo atom is significantly lowered compared to the
value obtained in the P.R.C. However, in Nb8C12+, an opposite trend is noticed, in which the f+ value of the attached iodine in TS-1 is found
to be lower than that in the P.R.C, and the f+ value of the Nbo atom seems to have a higher value
in TS-1 than in the P.R.C. The explanation of this unusual trend can
be provided by reciting the charge-transfer trend in between Nbo and iodine atoms as observed in the P.R.C. As explained earlier,
in the neutral Nb–metcar, as iodine is electron-rich, a major
portion of the electron density needed to form the Nbo–I
bond is contributed by the iodine atom. Because the Nbo–I bond is still partial in the P.R.Cs, it is therefore expected
that the flow of electron density will continue until the WBI of the
Nbo–I bond reaches a value of ∼1 and therefore
provides a stronger coordination. Thus, in the neutral metcar, the f+ value of iodine shows a gradual increase because
of the loss of electron density. On the other hand, the f+ value of the Nbo atom shows a slight decrement
as the incoming electron density from iodine is much greater than
the contribution provided by the Nbo atom for the bond
formation. An opposite situation occurs for the cationic system, where
the Nbo atom provides the major contribution toward the
bond formation and iodine atom plays a minor part. The WBI calculation
indeed confirms this explanation, and the Nbo–I
bond formation process is observed to be nearly complete in the TS-1
itself. For neutral system, the WBI of the Nbo–I
bond is found to be 0.98 and is observed to be about 1.21 for the
cationic system, that is, higher than the neutral one. The C–I
bond is also found to be mostly cleaved at the TS-1 as expected, having
a WBI of 0.38 and 0.34 in neutral and cationic systems, respectively.
After the intermediate ([A]), f+ values
of both the atoms follow a near parallel path upto complex [B] in
both neutral and cationic Nb–metcars. The value of the nucleophilic
Fukui index for the Nbi atom in both neutral and cationic
Nb–metcars is observed to be nearly constant till TS-1; then
after a sudden drop at the intermediate [A], it again steadily increases
and converges to the value obtained in complex [B]. The f+ value of the “C” atom is observed to be
the least perturbed throughout the reaction coordinate, and only a
single minor increment is noticed at the TS-1 on neutral Nb8C12. The unperturbed nature of f+ of the carbon atom throughout the reaction coordinate may
be due to the simultaneous bond breaking and formation process as
observed in both the transition states. In both Figure 6a,b, the Nbo atom, in which the
CH3 group finally gets migrated to form complex [B] (denoted
as NbCo in Figure 6a,b), shows a continuous decrement in the
respective Fukui function value from TS-1 up to complex [B]. Similar
to the Fukui index, the trend in the HOMO/SOMO–LUMO gaps (Figure 6c,d) along the reaction
coordinate is also found to be unique for the neutral and the cationic
clusters. The overall range of the HOMO–LUMO gap calculated
by using both M06-2X and BHandHLYP functional is found to be within
2–3 eV. The prime differences in between Figure 6c,d are again found to be located at the
position of the TS-1. In Figure 6a, the HOMO–LUMO gap shows a sudden drop at
TS-1, signifying a low HOMO–LUMO gap of the TS-1 compared to
the P.R.C. On the contrary, the SOMO–LUMO gap in the case of
cationic metcars shows a steady increase till reaching maximum at
complex [A] followed by a steady decrease and finally reaching a value
of 2.66 (2.7 in BHandHLYP) at complex [B]. Except for the BHandHLYP
calculated results shown in Figure 6c, the intermediate complex [A] is shown to have a
high HOMO/SOMO–LUMO gap, ensuring its high stability as an
intermediate. To have further information, we have performed an AIM
analysis on the optimized structures of key complexes as obtained
along the reaction pathway for the dissociation of CH3I
on both neutral and cationic Nb–metcars. The molecular graphs
of such a kind are assembled into two groups in Figure 7. The position of four different types of
critical points along with the bond paths is clearly visible. The
values of four important parameters, for example, electron density
(ρ), Laplacian of electron density (∇2ρ),
local energy density (H(r)), and
the electron localization function at two of the most important bond
critical points are also included in Figure 7.

4 Conclusions
The present article presents a concise theoretical account of the
reaction mechanism along with the kinetic and thermodynamic details
of the C–I bond dissociation reaction on niobium metcar and
its cation. The C–I dissociation reaction is the only experimentally
validated abstraction reaction observed on metcars till date. The
C–I activation process is also of enormous significance to
synthetic chemists. In-depth DFT investigation has shown that although
the dissociation process is a single step, the “R” group
migration is completed within an overall of two reaction steps consisting
of two transition states separated by an intermediate complex. This
investigation also signifies that there exists few fundamental differences
of the C–I dissociation process on neutral and cationic metcars
which are responsible for significantly altering the calculated reaction
parameters. Considering the overall range of calculated activation
barriers, Nb8C12+ is found to be
more reactive toward C–I dissociation. The first activation
barrier is observed to be of low-to-medium range, signifying a decent
catalytic activity of Nb–metcar toward monohalogen abstraction
compared to the commonly used catalysts. Aside from the mechanistic
details, few other useful reaction parameters such as the rate constants,
pre-exponential factor, and the temperature-dependent constant in
accordance to the three parametric Arrhenius equation are also included.
Further insights are gathered from the Fukui indices, HOMO/SOMO–LUMO
gap, and via the AIM analysis. The detailed mechanism of C–I
dissociation on metcars is still mostly unexplored, and hence the
current study may be able to provide a decent contribution to enlighten
some of the riddles encompassing metcars till this day.
