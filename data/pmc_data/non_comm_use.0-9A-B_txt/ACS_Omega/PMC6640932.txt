Efficient
hydrochlorination of 2-ethynylpyridines was achieved
without the use of special reagents. Ethynylpyridine readily reacts
with hydrochloric acid to form a pyridinium salt. The salt formation
considerably enhances the electrophilicity of the ethynyl group and
attracts a chloride ion as the counteranion. The spatial proximity
facilitates the nucleophilic addition of the halide anion to the ethynyl
group, producing 2-(2-chloroethenyl)pyridine in high yields. This
protocol could also be applied for hydrobromination and hydroiodination
using hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids, respectively. In the case
of acetic acid, the reaction did not proceed because of the low acidity
and lack of salt formation. This problem was overcome by exchanging
the counteranion using silver acetate; the resultant pyridinium acetate
underwent hydroacetoxylation.

Introduction
Hydrohalogenation of
a multiple bond is a fundamental approach
for the synthesis of halogenated compounds. Although the carbon–carbon
double bonds of alkenes undergo electrophilic addition of hydrogen
halides to afford alkyl halides, the carbon–carbon triple bonds
of alkynes cannot undergo similar reactions efficiently,1,2 primarily because of the lower stability of the cationic intermediate
derived from the electronegative sp carbon as compared with that from
an sp2 carbon. Moreover, the produced haloalkene exhibits
a higher reactivity when compared with the starting alkyne and undergoes
a second hydrohalogenation reaction.3 To
avoid this undesired second reaction, metal catalysts or reagents
other than hydrohalic acids are often used.4 On the other hand, alkynes undergo nucleophilic addition fairly
easily to yield substituted alkenes; however, the addition of hydrogen
halides initiated by the nucleophilic attack of a halide ion has not
been reported to date because of the low nucleophilicity.

To
this end, we focused on 2-ethynylpyridine 1, which
has both a basic ring nitrogen and an electrophilic ethynyl group
(Scheme 1), as it was
considered to be a suitable substrate for hydrohalogenation via nucleophilic
addition. In other words, the nitrogen of 1 forms a pyridinium
salt 3 upon treatment with hydrohalic acid 2, which enhances the electrophilicity of the ethynyl group. Furthermore,
the spatial proximity between the ethynyl group and the counteranion
facilitates the nucleophilic addition to afford 2-(2-haloethenyl)pyridine 4.

Scheme 1 Reaction Design of Hydrohalogenation of 2-Ethynylpyridine 1
The 2-(2-haloethenyl)pyridine
framework is often found in biologically
active compounds5 and is also used as a
synthetic intermediate for the synthesis of versatile compounds.6 Despite their high utility, only a few methods
are available for the preparation of ethenylpyridines. Specifically,
Guinchard et al. synthesized 2-(2-chloroethenyl)pyridine by the cross-coupling
reaction of potassium(2-chloroethenyl)trifluoroborates with 2-bromopyridine.7 Wittig bromoolefination of pyridinecarbaldehyde
leading to the synthesis of 2-(2-bromoethenyl)pyridine was also reported
by Kaloko and Hayford.8 However, these
approaches suffer from the poor availability of the starting materials
and low reaction efficiencies. There is no report regarding the preparation
of 4 upon addition of hydrogen halide 2 to 1, except for a single description,9 which prompted us to study this reaction.

Results and Discussion
When a suspension of pyridinium salt 3Aa, derived
from 1A (R = Ph) and hydrochloric acid 2a, was heated in benzene at 100 °C for 14 h, a small amount of
2-(2-chloro-2-phenylethenyl)pyridine hydrochloride (5Aa) was detected as a single isomer (Table 1, entry 1). The regio- and stereochemistries
of the product were confirmed using X-ray crystallography for the
hydrobrominated product 5Ab (Table 3, entry 1). Ethenylpyridine 4Aa was readily liberated upon treatment of 5Aa with an
equimolar amount of triethylamine. Among the several tested solvents,
aprotic polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetonitrile
were found to be effective; however, the yield was rather poor when
methanol was used (Table 1, entries 2–4). Although acetonitrile afforded the
best result, the yield of 5Aa was still 50%, and 50%
of 1A was recovered by the proton transfer from 3Aa to the more basic ethenylpyridine 4Aa formed
in situ (entry 4). Hence, the reaction was conducted in the presence
of additional 1 equiv of 2a. Although the reaction did
not proceed at room temperature, heating at higher than 60 °C
resulted in hydrochlorination (entries 5–7). Heating at 100
°C could shorten the reaction time, and all 3Aa was
consumed within 14 h to afford 5Aa in 82% yield (entry
8–10). Even though large amounts of hydrochloric acid were
used, the second hydrohalogenation was not observed because the sp2 carbon of 5Aa is less electrophilic than the
sp carbon of 3Aa (entry 11).

a 50% of 1A was recovered.

Several alkynes were used for this
reaction under optimized conditions
(Table 2). Diphenylacetylene
(6A) and 2-(phenylethynyl)nitrobenzene (6B) caused no change (entries 1 and 2). These results indicate that
the 2-pyridyl group is crucial for this reaction, as the pyridine
ring serves not only as an electron-withdrawing group but also as
a base to attract hydrogen chloride by forming pyridinium salt 3.

Ethynylpyridines 7 and 8, positional
isomers of 1A, revealed different reactivities. 3-Ethynylpyridine 7 was inert and was recovered quantitatively (entry 3). On
the other hand, 4-ethynylpyridine 8 underwent hydrochlorination,
although the reaction efficiency was low (entry 4). Although the nitrogen
activates the ethynyl group by an electron-withdrawing resonance effect,
the distance cannot diminish the electron density of the ethynyl group
because of the lack of electron-withdrawing inductive effects. Thus,
the distance between the basic site and the reaction sites is also
important for the hydrochlorination. In other words, the chloride
anion attacks the ethynyl group intramolecularly rather than intermolecularly.
Indeed, the reaction of 3Aa afforded 5Aa in a similar yield, even though the reaction mixture was diluted
from 0.5 to 0.05 M.

Next, other hydrohalic acids 2b–d were subjected to the reaction (Table 3). Hydrobromic acid 2b and hydroiodic acid 2c underwent the reaction
smoothly to give 2-(bromoethenyl)pyridine 5Ab and 2-(iodoethenyl)pyridine 5Ac in excellent yields (entries 1 and 2). Although hydrofluoric
acid 2d formed pyridinium salt 3Ad, the
subsequent addition reaction did not proceed, presumably because of
the low nucleophilicity of the fluoride anion (entry 3). Sulfonic
acids 2e and 2f and trifluoroacetic acid 2g exhibited similar reactivities and afforded salts 3Ae, 3Af, and 3Ag, respectively
(entries 4–6). On the other hand, the less acidic carboxylic
acids 2h and 2i could not form pyridinium
acetate 3Ah and 3Ai (entries 7 and 8). The
issue was resolved by anion exchange using silver acetate. When 2-(phenylethynyl)pyridinium
chloride (3Aa) and 2 equiv of silver acetate were heated
at 120 °C in acetonitrile, hydroacetoxylated product 4Ai was obtained, albeit in a low yield, and considerable amounts of 1A were obtained owing to the deprotonation of 3Aa by the more basic acetate anion (Scheme 2).10 Although
the formation of 4Ai was confirmed using 1H NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), it could not
be isolated using column chromatography because it hydrolyzed to form
phenacylpyridine, the hydrated form of 1A, on silica
gel. However, all attempts to exchange the chloride ion of 3Aa with the other halide ion using tetrabutylammonium fluoride, cesium
fluoride, potassium bromide, and potassium iodide failed under the
same reaction conditions.

Several ethynylpyridine hydrochlorides 3Ba–3Oa were used to expand the scope of substrates (Table 4). Hydrochlorides
of ethynylpyridines 3Ba–3Da, having
an electron-donating or an electron-withdrawing group on the benzene
ring, underwent the desired reaction to afford the corresponding chloroethenylpyridines 5Ba–5Da (entries 1–3). The ethynyl
group is not required to have an aryl group, as hexynylpyridine 3E furnished the hydrochlorinated product 5Ea in high yield (entry 4). Although a bulky tert-butyl
group diminished the reaction efficiency, the hydrochlorinated product 5Fa was obtained in a high yield at a higher reaction temperature
(entry 5). Substrates 3G–I, possessing
functional groups such as trimethylsilyl, methoxycarbonyl, or a hydroxymethyl,
afforded the corresponding products 5Ga–5Ia in moderate to excellent yields, highlighting the functional
group tolerance of the reaction under the employed conditions (entries
6–8). This reaction was applicable to terminal alkyne 3J, leading to the formation of 5Ja (entry 9).
Because olefinic protons have a coupling constant of 13.6 Hz, the E-form might be formed to avoid the steric repulsion between
a chloro and a pyridyl group. In cases of substrates possessing an
electron-withdrawing group, a small amount of inseparable isomer was
also formed (entries 3, 7, and 12). Although the structure of the
minor isomer has not been determined, it is considered to be a regioisomer
of 5 because the electron density at the α-carbon
of the pyridine moiety is also diminished.

Next, substituent
effects of the pyridine ring were studied because
electron-donating groups increase the basicity of the ring nitrogen
and electron-withdrawing groups diminish the electron density of the
ethynyl group.11 In the case of 3Ka, the reaction was suppressed, and severe conditions were required
because stabilization of the pyridinium cation by the electron-donating
group, especially in the case of 3Ka, could not diminish
the electron density of the ethynyl group sufficiently (entries 10
and 11, Scheme 3).
On the other hand, electron-withdrawing groups promoted the reactivity
for hydrochlorination to afford the corresponding products 5Ma and 5Na in moderate yields (entries 12 and 13). Hence,
the activation of the ethynyl group was found to be an influential
factor. When 2,3-bis(phenylethynyl)pyridinium salt 3Oa was used as a substrate, only the ethynyl group at the 2-position
was hydrochlorinated without any reaction on the ethynyl group at
the 3-position (entry 14).

Scheme 3 Resonance Structures of the Protonated 3Ja
Furthermore, this
protocol was applicable to other ethynylated
azaheterocycles 12 (Table 5). Although ethynylquinoline 12a and ethynylisoquinoline 12d underwent the hydrohalogenation to afford the corresponding
haloalkenes 13a–d in high yields,
8-ethynylquinoline 12e afforded a complex mixture because
the ethynyl group was not activated by the resonance effects of the
ring nitrogen. Pyrimidine 12f and benzimidazole 12g also underwent the reaction efficiently to afford the
corresponding haloalkenes 13f and 13g, respectively.

Azaheterocycles
The obtained 2-(2-bromoethenyl)pyridine 4Ab was subjected
to the Suzuki coupling. Both electron-rich and electron-poor boronic
acids underwent the cross-coupling reactions to afford triarylated
alkenes 14h–j in high yields (Scheme 4).12

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Triarylated Alkenes 14
Haloalkene 4Eb was a viable substrate for Sonogashira
coupling, affording corresponding enynes 15k and 15l (Scheme 5).8,13 On the other hand, when trimethylsilylacetylene
was used as a coupling partner, enyne 15m was not obtained,
and desilylation occurred under the employed conditions. Instead,
3,3′-bis(indolizine) 16 was isolated as a result
of double coupling and tandem cyclization (Scheme 6).14 Modification
of the 3,3′-positions of the bis(indolizine) framework was
easily achieved by changing the starting 2-(bromoethenyl)pyridines 4.

Conclusions
We
established a nucleophilic hydrohalogenation protocol using
ethynylpyridines containing a basic nitrogen and electrophilic ethynyl
group. The initial salt formation is crucial to attract a halide ion
and facilitate the nucleophilic addition to the ethynyl group. Each
hydrohalogenation afforded single stereoisomer, which is presumably
a Z form, although regioisomers were obtained in
some cases. The obtained 2-(haloethenyl)pyridines serve as substrates
for cross-coupling reactions to afford triarylalkenes and enynes,
which will be useful scaffolds for the development of new functional
materials.

General Procedure for Hydrohalogenation
To a solution
of 2-phenylethynylpyridine 1A (0.5 mmol, 89.5 mg) in
MeCN (10 mL), 12 M HCl (0.5 mmol, 0.042 mL) was added at room temperature,
and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Then, the mixture was heated
at 100 °C for 14 h in a sealed tube. Triethylamine (0.5 mmol,
0.07 mL) was added, and the mixture was extracted with CHCl3 (10 mL × 3), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated.
Purification was achieved using flash column chromatography on silica
gel to afford 2-(2-chloro-2-phenylethenyl)pyridine 4Aa (94 mg, 82%, 0.41 mmol eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate = 9/1) as
yellow oil.

When other substrates were used, reactions were
performed in a similar way.

Hydroacetoxylation
To a solution
of 2-(phenylethynyl)pyridinium
chloride (0.5 mmol, 115 mg) in MeCN (10 mL), silver acetate (1.0 mmol,
167 mg) was added. After heating the resultant mixture at 120 °C
for 6 h in a sealed tube, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure
to afford the reaction mixture as a residue.

The formation of
hydroacetoxylated product 4Ai was confirmed using 1H NMR, GC–MS, and HRMS spectra of the reaction mixture.
However, the product could not be isolated because of the instability
in the silica gel column chromatography.

Synthesis of Bis(indolizine)
To a solution of bromoethenylpyridine 4Eb (0.2 mmol, 48 mg) in NEt3 (1 mL) were added
PdCl2(PPh3)2 (0.02 mmol, 14 mg) and
CuI (0.2 mmol, 38 mg) under argon. After adding (trimethylsilyl)acetylene
(0.4 mmol, 0.056 mL) dropwise, the resultant mixture was stirred at
room temperature for 1 day. The reaction mixture was filtered using
Celite (10 g) with washing with CH2Cl2 (10 mL).
After the filtrate was concentrated, the residue was subjected to
flash chromatography on silica gel to give enyne 16n (13
mg, 58%, 0.058 mmol, eluted with hexane/EtOAc = 8/2) as blue oil.

When other enynes were used, the experiments were conducted in a
similar way.
