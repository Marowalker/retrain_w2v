Being
an optical semiconductor, tin disulfide (SnS2)
attracts increasing interest in the fields of heterogeneous photocatalysis
and photovoltaics. However, support from a graphene sheet in the form
of a nanocomposite is expected to increase the stability and effectiveness
of a SnS2 material in potential applications. We report
here novel nanocomposites of graphene-oxide-stacked hexagonal-shaped
pristine SnS2 nanodiscs (NDs of two different sizes) and
nanosheets synthesized using an in situ one-pot hydrothermal synthesis
process and the application of the nanocomposite as an efficient heterogeneous
photocatalyst. The as-synthesized morphology-oriented nanoparticles
and nanocomposites were comprehensively characterized, and finally,
excellent photocatalytic activity of reduced graphene oxide/SnS2 nanocomposites under visible-light irradiation was analyzed
using UV–vis spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography,
and gas chromatography. While precisely manipulating the nanocomposite
formation, we observed efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic
application of graphene-stacked SnS2 NDs in the quantitative
synthesis of aniline (99.9% yield, absolute selectivity) from nitrobenzene
(>99.9% conversion), in the reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to nontoxic
Cr(III), and in the degradation of mutagenic organic dyes. A possible
synergetic electrical and chemical coupling leads to effective carrier
separation in the semiconductor and charge transport in the nanocomposite,
which finally gives rise to efficient tandem photocatalysis reactions.

1 Introduction
Graphene
analogues of various inorganic layered materials with
two-dimensional (2D) morphology, mainly the transition metal chalcogenides,
have attracted considerable interest in recent years.1,2 Chemically modified graphene has many uses, such as in sensors,
energy materials, paper-like materials, field-effect transistors,
and biomedical applications, because of its excellent electrical,
thermal, and mechanical properties.3−5 Among various transition
metal chalcogenides, MoS2,6 MoSe2,7 WS2,8 WSe2,9 VS2,10 and HfS211 have layered structures preferably used in the formation
of binary nanocomposites with graphene or reduced graphene oxide (RGO)
for various applications. Tin disulfide (SnS2) is another
interesting semiconductor material with a layered structure analogous
to graphene, showing acceptability in potential applications such
as sensing, anodic material, photovoltaics, and energy storage.12−14 SnS2 exists in the CdI2 structure and can
be synthesized in a wide range of morphologies;15 moreover, because of the numerous vacant sites present
in the sandwiched structure of SnS2, it can be an important
host material for various intercalation reactions. This metal disulfide
with a moderate optical band gap usually has light-absorbing capabilities
in the visible-light region, thus serving as a promising class of
sensitizer for solar-light-driven photocatalysts. In terms of its
lower toxicity and wider spectral response, SnS2 is considered
as a potential material for photocatalytic activity as well.16−18

However, it would be interesting if nanoparticles (NPs) of
layered
SnS2 could be embedded in layered graphene oxide sheets
to
make nanocomposites and to extend the scope of applications that use
nanocomposites.19,20 In this scenario, exciton generation
and charge separation in the SnS2 semiconductor and charge
transport in graphene should result in a profitable synergetic effect.21−23 This could be a new concept for accessing most of the active sites
of the semiconductor’s NPs and the functional groups of partially
reduced GO for solar light harvesting and utilizing the excitons generated
thereof for multiple photocatalytic reactions. A high surface area
is expected for this system, which helps with the adsorption of substrate
molecules or reactants for photocatalytic reactions.

Herein,
we report a low-cost and environmentally friendly one-pot
hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of 2D SnS2 nanodiscs
(NDs) and nanosheets (NSs) and also developed an in situ synthesis
method to make their binary nanocomposites with RGO (see Scheme 1). The as-synthesized
nanocomposites (RGO/SnS2) were found to give an excellent
efficiency in the photocatalytic synthesis of aniline from nitrobenzene
(NB) (complete conversion of the substrate and absolute selectivity
of a product, quantitative yield), degradation of dyes [methylene
blue (MB) and rhodamine blue (Rh B)], and reduction of carcinogenic
Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III) in visible-light exposures under ambient
conditions. Hence, these visible-light-driven multiple photocatalytic
reactions make our RGO/SnS2 (GSnS2) ND and NS
samples promising heterogeneous photocatalysts for multiple important
environmental remediation reactions, including the removal of carcinogenic
and mutagenic dyes and toxic Cr(VI), the removal of volatile NB from
polluted water, or the production of aniline under green conditions.
Nevertheless, ND morphology is found to be more effective than NS
morphology in the present study.

an RGO/SnS2 Nanocomposite
by a One-Pot Hydrothermal Approach in the Presence of Either SDS or
AOT Surfactant
2 Results
and Discussion
A hydrothermal approach to synthesize SnS2 particles
in the presence of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
gives a hexagonal ND-like morphology but with a wide particle size
distribution. Thermal dissociation of thioacetamide (TAA) in an aqueous
solution gives sulfur ions at high temperature (180 °C),24 which would react with Sn4+ for the
nucleation of SnS2. SDS plays an important role in the
formation of the 2D irregular hexagonal ND-like morphology of SnS2 particles by considerably accelerating the growth of the
{100} and {101} facets specifically rather than other facets. However,
during in situ synthesis of the binary nanocomposite GSnS2, it is predicted that Sn4+ is tightly anchored on the
surface of exfoliated graphene oxide (GO) sheets by electrostatic
interactions25 owing to the presence of
many functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy groups,
over the surface of a GO sheet (shown in Scheme 1). After that, dissociated S ions from TAA
would result in nucleation, growth, and aggregation, and finally,
SDS-oriented growth of SnS2 NDs over the GO sheet is obtained.
The high temperature used and the presence of sulfur ions reduced
the initial GO sheets to RGO by excreting residual oxide functional
groups,26 giving the RGO nanocomposite
of SnS2 as GSnS2. Because of the presence of
RGO sheets as substrates, the SnS2 NPs are uniformly distributed
on the RGO surface. RGO could bind to SnS2 nuclei and restrain
their self-assembly into NDs. Moreover, the presence of SnS2 particles between RGO sheets prevents the restacking of graphene
layers and hence preserves their intriguing properties relative to
a few-layer structure. In another hydrothermal approach, we synthesized
NSs of SnS2 by changing the metal precursor, S source,
and type of surfactant. It followed a similar kind of formation and
growth mechanism as that mentioned for NDs; however, the morphology
transformation is facilitated by the amount of dioctyl sulfosuccinate
sodium salt (AOT) surfactant.12 The reaction
time and temperature were the same in both cases, which were 10 h
and 180 °C, respectively. As predicted, AOT strongly binds to
sulfur-terminated {001} facets, hence considerably accelerating the
growth of the (100) and (101) planes of the layered structure beyond
the disc to sheet morphology.

2.1 Structure, Surface, and
Morphology
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
as-synthesized ND
samples are compared in Figure 1a with that of bulk pristine SnS2. All reflections
in the diffraction patterns of as-synthesized SnS2 and
GSnS2 were well-indexed with bulk hexagonal SnS2, with calculated lattice parameters a = b = 3.648 Å and c = 5.894 Å (space
group P3̅m1; JCPDS file no.
22-0951).12−14 Interestingly, it was found that the intensity of
the (001) peak is lower and much more broad than the corresponding
bulk XRD peak of hexagonal SnS2, which indicates restricted
growth of SnS2 particles along this crystal facet and hence
results in a 2D hexagonal flake-like morphology. In addition, a small
peak in GSnS2 that belongs to RGO appeared at 26°
corresponding to the (100) plane, which is usually indexed at 9°
in pristine GO (shown in the inset of Figure 1a), hence confirming the formation of an
RGO-stacked SnS2 nanocomposite (GSnS2).27 Raman spectroscopy determined that hexagonal
SnS2 has a pure phase by locating the characteristic A1g mode at 314 cm–1.28 In the case of the GSnS2 sample, the intensity ratio
(ID:IG) is
about 2.206, which is higher than that of graphene sheets, with the
D band located at 1361 cm–1 and the G band located
at 1604 cm–1, as shown in Figure 1b. On the growth of SnS2 NPs over
graphene sheets, a more disordered carbon structure is expected because
of defects generated on the formed nanocomposite. The formation of
a nanocomposite is further confirmed from FTIR measurements (see Figure 1c), where an intense
peak for the surface hydroxyl groups of GO completely vanished in
the GSnS2 sample and the peak intensities of the carbonyl
and epoxy groups decreased.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of as-synthesized SnS2 NDs, GSnS2 nanocomposite, GO, and bulk SnS2. (b) Raman spectra
of as-synthesized SnS2 NDs, GSnS2, and GO. (c)
FTIR and (d) BET characterization of as-synthesized SnS2 NDs and GSnS2 nanocomposite.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) plots using the
multipoint
BET equation indicate a type IV isotherm with H3/H4 type hysteresis,
as shown in Figure 1d. Specific surface areas of 29.4 and 85.5 m2/g were determined
from N2 adsorption–desorption BET isotherm plots
of SnS2 and GSnS2, respectively. Thus, the high
surface area of the SnS2/RGO nanocomposite compared with
that of SnS2 NPs is due to the presence of graphene sheets,
which additionally enhance the catalytic property of GSnS2 by offering more surface area for substrate adsorption. Furthermore,
optical absorption measurements were carried out followed by band
gap determination for the as-synthesized SnS2 and GSnS2 NDs (Figure S1). A direct band
gap value of 2.32 eV was determined by the Tauc and Davis–Mott
model (see the Supporting Information for
calculations) for both SnS2 and GSnS2, which
is consistent with earlier reports for SnS2 samples,29 confirming a pure phase for our as-synthesized
SnS2 and GSnS2. The important aspect of the
obtained band gap and the semiconductor is that 2.32 eV corresponds
to a visible-light wavelength of 534 nm, which is the most intense
region in the solar spectrum. Thus, we expect that photons will be
maximally absorbed by SnS2 and GSnS2 and that
charge separation for photocatalytic reactions will be maximal.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) images of as-synthesized SnS2 ND particles and
their nanocomposites detailing their morphologies, topographies, and
crystal structures are summarized in Figure 2. As-synthesized SnS2 has a ND-like
morphology and was found to be aligned in two different orientations
on the TEM grid, one that is flat-lying and another that is face-to-face
stacked on its edges, as seen in Figure 2a. The distribution of an ND particle diameter
(edge to edge) was found to be broad; however, the average size was
calculated to be 35 × 9 nm (diameter, thickness). Further crystallographic
orientations of hexagonal NDs were confirmed from HRTEM analyses by
studying the facets that were flat-lying or standing on their edges
in a stacked pillar. Distinctive sets of lattice fringes, which correspond
to the reticular planes of hexagonal pristine SnS2 lying
flat on a hexagonal facet , were identified. The 2D fast Fourier transform
(2D FFT) calculated from Figure 2c, shown in Figure 2d, also further confirmed the presence of (100) planes,
whereas HRTEM from a side view indexed the presence of another characteristic
plane (001) with a lattice spacing of 0.58 nm for hexagonal SnS2. The FFT shown in Figure 2f with a bright spot at d001 = 0.58 nm indicates that hexagonal NDs are preferably stacked along
their hexagonal facet in the ⟨001⟩ direction. Herein,
the morphology of the 2D SnS2 NDs is mainly attributed
to the accelerated growth of six degenerate crystalline planes {100}
and prohibited growth of the {001} plane. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analyses demonstrated the topographies and elemental ratios
(electron diffraction for X-ray analysis, EDAX) for SnS2 and GSnS2 NDs (Figure S2).
A membrane-like morphology was more easily visualized for graphene in GSnS2 over SnS2 NDs relative to their respective TEM images. EDAX analysis
gave a 1:2 stoichiometric ratio of Sn to S. Moreover, carbon (41%)
from RGO and oxygen (29%) were also observed in the GSnS2 system. Thus, from XRD and low-magnification TEM and HRTEM data,
it is evident that SnS2 formed a layered morphology analogous
to graphene and a stacked topology, which is helpful for adsorbing
more substrate and for the efficient movement of the charge carriers
(electrons and holes) generated from photoexcitation.

Two other sets of ND
samples (SnS2 ND15 and GSnS2 ND15) were prepared
by increasing the reaction time to 15
h, as mentioned in the Experimental Section
(see Figure S3 for TEM image and XRD).
For the SnS2 material, the powder XRD pattern suggested
a pure phase and the TEM image depicted a larger (∼90 nm) hexagonal
ND-like morphology. A control reaction was also carried out for 5
h; however, this reaction yielded phase impurity (Figure S3c).

Structural, surface, and morphology characterizations
of SnS2 NSs and the corresponding composites with RGO are
elaborated
in Figure 3. All characteristic
XRD peaks in Figure 3a in as-synthesized SnS2 and GSnS2 NSs are
well-indexed to the hexagonal structure of SnS2 (JCPDS
no. 23-0677; space group P3m1).12,13 On the other hand, the intensity of the (100) plane was found to
be higher than its intensity in the bulk pattern compared to that
of the (001) and (101) planes, revealing the growth of SnS2 NPs along the ⟨100⟩ direction and hence the possible
formation of a 2D-type morphology in this case as well. The specific
surface area was calculated from BET plots (Figure 3b) and found to be ∼20 m2 g–1 for the SnS2 NSs, which increased
for the graphene nanocomposite up to 100 m2 g–1. The N2 adsorption–desorption curve indicates
that the structure is mesoporous, which, according to the IUPAC classification,
is a type IV isotherm with an H3-type hysteresis loop attributed to
non-rigid aggregates of plate-like particles giving rise to slit-type
pores.30 The mesoporosity of the GSnS2 NS sample is observed from the pore size distribution curve,
with a pore size of 3–4 nm and pore volume of ∼0.132
cm3 g–1, shown in the inset of Figure 3b. This high surface
area and porosity are major advantages for the efficient adsorption
of reactant molecules on our proposed photocatalyst’s surface.
The low-magnification TEM images in Figure 3c,d depict the NS morphology of the as-synthesized
SnS2 particles with an average diameter of 140–160
nm. Stacking of RGO sheets is seen in the case of the GSnS2 NS sample. A top-view HRTEM image of the GSnS2 NS sample
shows clear lattice fringes of the (100) plane with d = 0.31 nm (Figure 3e). Interestingly, we were able to see reticular planes of the edges
of SnS2 NSs in only a few particles, and one such edge
is shown in Figure 3f, where the sheet thickness was found to be 7.5 nm. Furthermore,
RGO-stacked SnS2 NSs are seen in SEM imaging (Figure 3f). Optical absorption
measurements have been carried out followed by band gap determination
of as-synthesized SnS2 NSs (Figure S4), and the calculated direct band gap value is 2.45 eV.

2.2 Spectroscopy Studies of SnS2 and
GSnS2 NDs
To study the exciton separation behavior
of the semiconductor and its nanocomposite, we carried out photoluminescence
(PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. A strong
PL peak at 425 nm was observed for SnS2 NDs, which is weak
in the case of the GSnS2 ND sample (Figure 4a), suggesting that the recombination of
photoinduced charge carriers is inhibited greatly by interfacial charge
transfer between RGO and SnS2 NDs. To understand this process,
TRPL spectroscopy was performed and data are shown in Figure 4b. The emission decay data
were fitted triexponentially. On calculating average lifetime (⟨τ⟩),
it was found that τ for GSnS2 NDs (0.8 ns) is less
than that for SnS2 NDs (1.05 ns). This shortening of the
lifetime in GSnS2 NDs indicates the emergence of a nonradiative
pathway, that is, the delocalization of electrons from SnS2 to RGO and hence effective carrier separation.31 This happens because of the transfer of electrons from
the conduction band (CB) of SnS2 to the Fermi level of
RGO, and this assumption is corroborated with the quenching of emission.

(⟨τ⟩).

2.3 Photocatalytic Degradation of Dyes
To determine the optimal amount of photocatalyst for all reactions,
we carried out a few controlled reactions by varying the amount of
the catalyst with time, keeping the substrate concentration the same.
In the photochemical reactor vessel, 25 mL of 0.01 mM MB was taken
and a dye degradation reaction was carried out by using 5.0, 7.5,
10.0, 12.5, or 15.0 mg of GSnS2 NDs. The results are summarized
in Table 1, which shows
that 12.5 mg of catalyst is the optimum amount for maximum efficiency
at a given time. Another controlled reaction was carried out to determine
the SnS2:GO ratio that achieves the best photocatalytic
performance. For this purpose, GSnS2 ND composites were
prepared by varying the amount of GO. Figure S5 shows a comparison of the degradation of 0.1 mM Rh B in 15 min using
bare SnS2 NDs, GSnS2 NDs with 5 mg of GO, GSnS2 NDs with 10 mg of GO, and GSnS2 NDs with 15 mg
of GO, resulting in 75.2, 91.8, 99, and 95.2% degradation, respectively.
Hence, we found that the GSnS2 ND with 10 mg of GO is the
best photocatalyst for the proposed photocatalytic reactions, and
we used the same ratio for further studies.

Therefore, aniline synthesis, dye degradation, and
Cr(VI) reduction
reactions were carried out by taking 12.5 mg of photocatalyst. Similar
controlled reactions were carried out using GSnS2 NS as
the photocatalyst (data not shown), where 12.5 mg of the catalyst
sample was also found to be the most effective. Furthermore, no reaction
occurred in the absence of GSnS2 samples, implying the
necessity of the photocatalyst for the conversion.

For the investigation
of the SnS2 and GSnS2 nanocomposites as visible-light
photocatalysts for the degradation
of MB and Rh B dyes, the obtained results are summarized in Figure 5 (see the Supporting Information for calculations).32 Complete degradation (99.9%) of 0.01 mM MB dye
takes place in 5 min in the presence of the GSnS2 ND photocatalyst
(Figure 5a), where
the intensity of the peak at λmax = 655 nm decreased
gradually without shifting the peak position to the baseline, indicating
complete degradation. However, the amount of time required for the
complete degradation of MB dye using GSnS2 ND15 and GSnS2 NS was found to be 8 and 14 min, respectively (Figure 5b,c). A similar trend appeared
when all three nanostructured GSnS2 samples were studied
for the photocatalytic degradation of Rh B dye. The amount of time
required for the complete degradation of Rh B dye using GSnS2 NDs, a corresponding 15 h sample, and GSnS2 NSs was found
to be 15, 18, and 35 min, respectively. In all of these cases, the
activities of simple SnS2 samples (without RGO) were also
compared and found to be less effective than the corresponding RGO
nanocomposites.

Rh B dyes

and GSnS2 NSs, respectively. (d–f) Photocatalytic
degradation of Rh B (0.01 mM, 25 mL) with a gradual decrease in the

Apparent rate constants (kap,
pseudo-first-order
kinetics) for each of the photocatalytic reactions were calculated,
and the reaction kinetics graphs are shown in Figure 6. kap was found
to be maximal for the degradation reactions in which GSnS2 ND was used as the photocatalyst (Figure 6a,d). kap gradually
decreased to a minimum for the degradation of both dyes when GSnS2 NS was used as the photocatalyst (Figure 6c,e). Thus, Figures 5 and 6 together imply
that GSnS2 ND is
the best RGO/SnS2 nanocomposite-based photocatalyst among
the three RGO/SnS2 samples with different morphologies
studied in the present work. To compare the catalytic activity of
our photocatalyst with those reported in the literature, we calculated
the activity parameter K = kap/m, where kap is the apparent rate constant and m is the mass
of the catalyst loaded. The activity parameters of some recently reported
highly active catalysts were compared with our measured activity parameter.
The high activity of our catalyst was noted compared with that of
a few of the best reported activities for the same photocatalytically
induced reaction33−37 using different types of NPs and their composites.

Rh B dye degradation reactions depicted in Figure 4 using samples (d) GSnS2 NDs,

The reusability of the photocatalysts was studied
over 10 continuous
cycles, and the photocatalytic activities versus the number of cycles
are shown in Figure 7a–d. GSnS2 NDs were found to be excellent in this
case as well, which showed only a 5% decrease in photocatalytic efficiency
even after 10 cycles (Figure 7a,b), which is better than that of the simple SnS2 ND, GSnS2 ND15, and GSnS2 NS samples. The
enhanced photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized GSnS2 nanocomposite is due to the presence of more active sites as compared
with that of bare SnS2 NDs, which facilitates the adsorption
of dye molecules, efficient charge separation in SnS2,
and transportation of photoelectrons during photocatalysis. On the
other hand, the enhanced activity of GSnS2 NDs over GSnS2 ND15 and GSnS2 NSs is attributed to the former
having smaller particles and possibly to its smaller band gap. Notably,
in any case, no degradation of the dye is observed under dark for
a prolonged period in the presence of the GSnS2 ND catalyst
with the highest activity (Figure 7e), corroborating the photocatalytic nature of our
as-synthesized nanocomposite products.

GSnS2 photocatalysts up to 10
cycles at 25 °C. (a, b) Recyclability of GSnS2 ND

for all photocatalytic reactions (degradation of dyes, hydrogenation
of NB, and reduction of Cr(VI) in the presence of GSnS2 NDs).

At this point, the question arises
as to whether the dyes are truly
decomposed or just decolorized to a colorless solution. To study this
phenomenon, we chose the crucial dye MB for the decomposition study
and carried out high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
optical absorption measurements (in the UV region) to observe the
nature of both the mixture after the photocatalytic reaction and the
original MB solution. As per the HPLC data, there is only one peak
observed in a standard (0.01 mM) MB solution at a retention time of
30 min (Figure S6a), whereas no such peak
was observed at the same retention time in the MB-degraded extract
obtained after a 5 min photocatalytic reaction using GSnS2 NDs, which indicates the complete degradation of MB instead of decolorization.
Furthermore, from the optical absorption spectra, it was found that
two peaks appeared for MB at positions of 291 and 655 nm because of
its aromatic ring and heteroaromatic skeleton, respectively (Figure S6b). With increasing photocatalytic reaction
time, the sharp peak at 655 nm disappeared because of the cleavage
of a C=N bond. At the same time, a significant reduction in
the 291 nm peak was observed, which is due to the multistep breaking
of an aromatic fragment to CO2 molecules.38

To check the long-term durability of the GSnS2 ND sample,
characterizations of the photocatalysts were done after 50 cycles
of Rh B degradation. The photocatalysts were separated after 50 cycles
(only 20% efficiency loss) and washed with distilled water, and then
XRD and TEM analyses were performed (see Figure S7). The XRD pattern after catalysis shows a pure phase of
SnS2 without the observation of any other impurity or phase,
and the TEM image shows the retainment of the ND-like morphology,
which proves the long-term stability of the photocatalyst beyond degradation.

2.4 Photocatalytic Synthesis of Aniline from Nitrobenzene
The GSnS2 ND sample was found to be the best among the
three photocatalysts used in the present study, as demonstrated earlier.
Hence, we used a GSnS2 ND sample for further photocatalytic
activity exploration. The as-synthesized nanocomposite GSnS2 ND was used for the synthesis of aminoarenes from nitroarenes. Interestingly,
the results are very impressive, and finally, we obtained >99.9%
conversion
of 2.0 mM NB to aniline in the presence of 12.5 mg of GSnS2 NDs. The reaction was carried out under green conditions with the
addition of ammonium formate as a quencher for photogenerated holes
under a nitrogen atmosphere and visible-light illumination.39,40Figure 8a shows the
optical absorption spectra of disappearing NB and newly forming aniline
in the presence of the GSnS2 and SnS2 samples.
The characteristic peak of NB at 267 nm decreases with an increase
in time, with a 99.9% yield and selectivity (calculated from GC data;
see Figure 8c). GC
was performed after extracting the reaction mixture and dissolving
it in a chloroform solvent. Aniline was observed within 90 min, and
the peak position was shifted toward λ = 300 nm.
The present visible-light (≥400 nm)-driven reaction was found
to be very efficient at room temperature and atmospheric pressure
compared to that in recent reports with other photocatalysts under
similar reaction conditions,39 hence making
the as-synthesized GSnS2 NDs applicable as a future photocatalyst
for such organic conversions over a wide range. The apparent rate
constant was found to be 0.027 min–1 for this reaction
when the GSnS2 nanocomposite was used as the photocatalyst
(Figure 8b). After
each photocatalytic reaction, the catalyst was recycled by air-drying
and reused. Only a 7% decrease in the efficiency of the catalyst up
to 5 cycles was observed (Figure 8d), indicating the stability and reusability of GSnS2. The minor efficiency loss may be attributed to a loss of
the catalyst during the centrifugation and washing processes.

2.5 Photoreduction
of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
Figure 9 shows the
results of the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) in an acidic solution
(at pH 3) using SnS2 and GSnS2 as catalysts
under visible-light irradiation. Results of dark condition reactions
are depicted in Figure 7e. The reduction of Cr(VI) occurs quite rapidly, with an apparent
reaction rate 0.040 min–1, and approaches 94% reduction
to reach equilibrium in 90 min in the presence of the GSnS2 catalyst, in contrast to SnS2, which shows only 71% reduction,
hence making as-synthesized GSnS2 as an efficient photocatalyst
for Cr(VI) reduction compared to photocatalysts in earlier reports.41 On performing the recyclability test for 5 cycles,
only a 3% efficiency loss was observed for GSnS2, whereas
the efficiency loss was 20–25% in the case of SnS2 NDs (shown in Figure S8). To check whether
Cr(VI) is really reduced to Cr(III) rather than adsorbed on the catalyst
surface to produce the decrease in the intensity of the optical absorption
peak at λmax = 372 nm, a qualitative analysis was
carried out on the supernatant solution after the photocatalysis reaction.
To 1 mL of the supernatant solution of the reaction mixture was added
a 0.1 M NaOH solution (2 mL), which produced a gray-green gelatinous
precipitate of Cr(OH)3, which was further dissolved in
the presence of additional acid (H2SO4); hence,
a light green solution of Cr(III) was obtained,42 confirming that the photocatalytic reduction reaction took
place. TEM analysis was performed on the separated catalyst after
the completion of the 5th reaction cycle, and no adsorbed chromium
ions were observed as an adsorbate over the catalyst surface, as shown
in Figure S9.

2.6 Mechanism
of Photocatalytic Reactions
A schematic diagram to understand
the mechanism of all three photocatalytic
reactions using GSnS2 nanomaterials is shown in Figure 10 and is based on
a few of our new findings and a few earlier reports.39,43,44 The reactions occurred by electron–hole
pair generation from the SnS2 semiconductor under visible-light-driven
conditions followed by efficient exciton separation. It is well-known
that the Fermi level of graphene lies lower than the CB of SnS2. Hence, excitation of the semiconductor with suitable wavelengths
leads to the drifting of electrons from the SnS2 CB to
the Fermi level of graphene. Notably, reverse movement is not expected;
otherwise, we would not observe any photocatalytic reaction. Graphene-supported
GSnS2 nanocomposites have more active sites because of
the presence of functional groups, and the electron transfer process
is fast. In NB reduction, as shown in Figure 10a, the NB molecule accepts an electron and
a hydrogen ion from water under a nitrogen environment and is converted
to the aniline molecule. Ammonium formate acts as a quencher for photogenerated
holes, confirming the occurrence of a free radical reaction. In addition,
the presence of 2D monolayers of graphene also increases the concentration
of the reactants accumulating over the surface of the photocatalysts
because of the high surface area. Hence, the graphene support provided
an increased opportunity for spatial contact between photogenerated
electrons and reactant NB molecules.

Figure 10 Schematic representation showing all
three photocatalytic reactions
using the graphene-stacked SnS2 ND composite system (GSnS2) as the photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation. (a)
Mechanism of photocatalytic conversion of NB to aniline using ammonium
formate as a hole quencher, (b) mechanism of photocatalytic degradation
of dyes (MB and Rh B), and (c) mechanism of photoreduction of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III) in acidic medium.

In the photodegradation of dyes and the photoreduction of
Cr(VI),
as shown in Figure 10b,c, mainly oxyradicals, such as hydroxyl, superoxide, and HO2• radicals, are formed in the aqueous solution
under visible-light irradiation when sufficient e– and h+ separation occurs from graphene-supported SnS2 semiconductor NDs. The cationic dyes are adsorbed over the
surface of the photocatalyst and react with OH• to
generate a cationic dye radical (dye+•),36 which leads to nontoxic byproducts. In the case
of chromium reduction, at pH 3, aqueous Cr(VI) is reduced to Cr(III)
by more hydrogen ions (8H+), and 4 water molecules are
generated in the whole process, as shown in Figure 10c.

From the above analyses, it is clear that the efficiency of the
present photocatalytic reactions is based on (a) the suitable band
gap of SnS2, (b) the position of the band gap in visible-light
irradiation (solar spectrum) for maximum photon absorption that results
in (c) maximum exciton generation, (d) effective electron mobility
by graphene sheets to the reactants, and (e) better adsorption of
reactants/substrates due to the high surface area with recycling.
The overall photocatalytic activities of the RGO/SnS2 ND
composite, which are better than those in recent reports33−37 on similar materials, in the synthesis of aniline for the degradation
of dyes (MB and Rh B) and Cr(VI) reduction reactions are summarized
in Table 2.

3 Conclusions
In summary, 2D SnS2 hexagonal NDs (of two different
sizes) and NSs and their graphene-loaded nanocomposites (GSnS2) were successfully synthesized by a simple, economic, one-pot
hydrothermal approach. Superior visible-light-driven photocatalytic
conversions were demonstrated by all three materials and their corresponding
RGO-based nanocomposites. However, it is emphasized that as-synthesized
GSnS2 NDs exhibited visible-light (≥400 nm)-driven
powerful photocatalytic activity in the synthesis of aniline from
NB by a hydrogenation reaction. The conversion of substrate was >99.9%,
and the yield and selectivity of the product, aniline, were 99.9%
at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure. The same nanocomposite catalyst
very efficiently degraded mutagenic dyes (MB and Rh B) to nontoxic
products in a shorter time period. In addition, as a multifunctional
photocatalyst, GSnS2 NDs effectively reduced carcinogenic
Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III) under ambient conditions. In all cases,
the reusability of the GSnS2 photocatalyst was excellent
over many cycles. The layered structure, specific 2D morphology, and
enhanced electron mobility in the stacked graphene sheets due to the
small size, large specific surface area, and efficient charge carrier
separation in the material led to an excellent photocatalytic behavior
of GSnS2. All of these attractive features of low-cost
GSnS2 obtained from a simple synthesis make it ideal as
an efficient visible-light-driven heterogeneous photocatalyst for
industrial waste/polluted water treatment and in the synthesis of
commodity organic chemicals.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Graphite powder (99%),
tin(IV) acetate (Sn(CH3COO)4, 99%), tin(IV)
bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (99%), AOT (96%), hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS), and TAA (99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA. Ortho-phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 98%)
and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 80%) were obtained from Thomas Baker,
India. Sulfuric acid (98%), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 98.5%), ammonium formate (98%), MB (99%), Rh B (99%), sodium sulfide
(Na2S, 98.5%), and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, 99%) were obtained from Merck, India. Hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2, 59%) was obtained from Fischer
Scientific, India. SDS (99%) was obtained from SRL, India. NB (99%)
was obtained from Spectrochem, India. All chemicals were used without
any further purification.

4.2 Synthesis of SnS2 NDs
In a typical synthesis process, 1 mmol of tin(IV) acetate
(in 2 mL
of water) was added to 3 mmol of SDS (dissolved in 5 mL of water),
and the mixture was stirred for 5 min. To this solution was added
4 mmol of TAA (dissolved in 1 mL of water), and it was further stirred
for 30 min. Thereafter, 2 mL of HMDS was added to the mixture while
stirring. The total volume of a 50 mL reaction mixture was made by
adding 40 mL of water. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at
180 °C for 10 h. After the reaction was completed, the product
was rinsed with absolute ethanol and distilled water two times and
finally dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol for further characterization.
This sample is SnS2 ND. In another reaction, all of the
above reaction parameters were kept the same except for the reaction
time, which was increased to 15 h to produce larger particles. This
sample is SnS2 ND15.

4.3 One-Pot
Synthesis of RGO/SnS2 ND
Nanocomposites (GSnS2 ND)
RGO nanocomposites of
SnS2 NDs were synthesized in a similar manner as that mentioned
above (Scheme 1), except
that a solution of 10 mg of as-synthesized exfoliated GO sheets (synthesized
by a modified version of Hummer’s method)45 in 10 mL of water was added first to the Sn(IV) precursor
solution before adding the S precursor (TAA) solution. The rest of
the process is the same as that described earlier. This sample is
GSnS2 ND. Another set of RGO/SnS2 nanocomposites
was prepared following a similar procedure, except that the reaction
time was increased to 15 h. This sample is GSnS2 ND15.

4.4 Synthesis of SnS2 NSs
Tin(IV)
bis(acetylacetonate) dichloride (1 mmol) dissolved in a minimum
amount of distilled water (2 mL) was added to 5 mmol of AOT, which
was dissolved in 10 mL of water and stirred for 30 min. Thereafter,
3 mmol of Na2S (dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water) was
added slowly to the above mixture and stirred for another 30 min.
This reaction mixture was then transferred to an autoclave that was
sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 10 h. After completing the
reaction, the product was rinsed with absolute ethanol and distilled
water several times and dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol for further characterization
or dried for photocatalytic studies. This sample is SnS2 NS.

4.5 One-Pot Synthesis of RGO/SnS2 NS
Nanocomposites (GSnS2 NS)
RGO nanocomposites of
SnS2 NSs were synthesized in a similar manner as that mentioned
earlier (Scheme 1),
except that a solution of 10 mg of as-synthesized exfoliated GO sheets
(synthesized by modified version of Hummer’s method)45 in 10 mL of water was added first to the Sn(IV)
precursor solution before adding an S precursor (Na2S)
solution. The rest of the process is the same as that described earlier.
This sample is GSnS2 NS.

4.6 Characterization
XRD patterns of
the as-synthesized products were collected at room temperature using
a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer system using a monochromatized
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) source. Optical absorption
measurements were carried out using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV–visible
spectrophotometer. A diluted, well-dispersed solution of NDs in absolute
ethanol was used for the absorption study. PL spectra were recorded
on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with an intense
Xenon flash lamp. A TRPL study was carried out at room temperature
using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoro Hub and a single photon counting
controller having a Nano LED of 370 nm and pulse duration of 1.2 ns.
The band edge PL lifetime was examined by monitoring time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy. Time-decay spectra were obtained for nanocomposites
excited at λex = 370 nm. TEM and phase-contrast HRTEM
measurements were performed using an FEI Technai G2-20
transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV. SEM and EDAX measurements were performed using a JEOL JSM
6610 at 20 kV, with a width distance of 10 mm and spot size of 30.
EDAX was performed at a resolution of 135.2 eV. BET surface area and
porosity measurements of the as-synthesized material were evaluated
using a surface area and pore size analyzer (Gemini-V, Micromeritics,
USA) at 77 K. Before analysis, samples were degassed in situ at 100
°C for 8 h. FTIR spectra were recorded by the KBr method using
a PerkinElmer FTIR 2000 spectrophotometer. GC was performed using
a Shimadzu-14A instrument connected to a HP-5 capillary column (30
m, HP-5). An HPLC technique was performed using a Waters 2996 multiwavelength
(λ) fluorescence detector instrument.

4.7 Photocatalytic
Activity Test
All
of the photocatalytic tests were performed under standard conditions,
as reported recently,46 and under visible-light
irradiation. A conventional mercury vapor lamp of 250 W, 12 750
lumens (Philips, HPL-N, Color Rendering Index 45 Ra8, color temperature
4100 K) was used as the light source, and the wavelength distribution
of the light source was 400–700 nm (white light). The distance
between the light source and the reaction mixture was 12 cm, and the
optical irradiance at the sample position was calculated using a solar
meter to be 525 × 100 lux at room temperature. A photocatalyst
(SnS2 or GSnS2; 12.5 mg) was added to 25 mL
of an NB (2.0 mM), MB (0.01 mM), Rh B (0.01 mM), or Cr(VI) (0.5 mM
of pH 3) aqueous solution, and then the reaction mixture was ultrasonicated
for 15 s to completely disperse the catalyst in the reaction solution.
After this, all reaction mixtures were stirred under dark for 1 h
to ensure the establishment of the adsorption–desorption equilibrium
between the catalyst and reactants under the N2 environment
at room temperature. Then, the suspension was positioned inside a
cylindrical vessel surrounded by circulating water to control the
temperature and irradiated with the 250 W light source. The circulation
of water over the reaction vessel ensured the cancellation of IR heating
of the substrates. After regular intervals of time, 1 mL of a sample
was taken and centrifuged at 4000 rpm to remove the catalyst, and
concentrations of the reaction mixture were measured in the supernatant
solution by recording absorption spectra and noting the gradual decrease
in the characteristic absorption peak at 655 (MB), 554 (Rh B), 372
(Cr(VI)), or 267 nm (NB).

4.8 Qualitative Inorganic Analysis
of Cr(III)
To 1 mL of the supernatant solution of the reaction
mixture after
the completion of the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) was added
a 0.1 M NaOH solution (2 mL), which produced the gray–green
gelatinous precipitate of Cr(OH)3; this was dissolved in
the presence of additional acid (H2SO4), and
a light green solution of Cr(III) was confirmed.42
