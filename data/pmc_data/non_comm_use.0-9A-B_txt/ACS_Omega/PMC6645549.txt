The removal possibility of sorbed
Cs from
weathered biotite (WB), which is considered a major Cs adsorbent in
the soil of Fukushima, has been investigated by the addition of an
NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt powder with a 1:1 ratio of
Na and Ca and subsequent heat treatment under a reduced pressure of
14 Pa. X-ray fluorescence analysis was used to determine the Cs removal
rate at elevated temperatures. The structural changes and new phases
formed were determined using powder X-ray diffraction as well as electron
diffraction and X-ray microanalysis in a transmission electron microscope.
We found that Cs was completely removed from the specimen heated at
700 °C, where WB completely decomposed and augite was formed.
On the basis of this finding, we propose the Cs-free mineralization
method as a new soil-decontamination process in which Cs minerals
are transformed by heating with certain additives into minerals that
cannot incorporate Cs.

Introduction
A large quantity of radioactive nuclides
was scattered by the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident that occurred in March 2011.
Most of them were deposited on the soil around Fukushima prefecture,
and more than 20 million m3 of radioactive contaminated
soil was placed in temporary storage facilities as a result of the
decontamination process of the land. This soil is to be managed in
middle storage facilities for the next 30 years. Therefore, volume
reduction of the contaminated soil is an emergent problem.1−5 Among the scattered radioactive nuclides, 137Cs is the
major source of radiation because of its large quantity and relatively
long half-life. Most of the 137Cs has been reported to
be strongly fixed to clay minerals, especially weathered biotite (WB),
in the soil.6 WB is derived from granite
and has a structure with interstratifications of biotite and vermiculite
(or hydrated) layers formed by weathering. Such WB is ubiquitous in
the soil in the eastern region of Fukushima prefecture.7 Removing Cs absorbed by WB using, for example,
an ion-exchange process with other cations is difficult,8 although the efficient removal of Cs from soil
by hydrothermal treatment with Mg2+ has been reported.9

Heat treatment is a highly efficient soil-decontamination
treatment.
The basic concept of the treatment involves heating with the addition
of an alkali chloride to the soil. As a result, clay minerals in the
soil melt and Cs sorbed to the minerals sublimates as a chloride.
According to a previous report, more than 99% of Cs can be removed
using this method.10 However, heating to
temperatures greater than 1000 °C is necessary to melt clay minerals,
which leads to a high cost of this process. By contrast, we have developed
a new process to remove most Cs from WB. This process involves adding
a mixed salt to WB and heating the mixture to 650 °C under a
reduced pressure of 14 Pa; thereafter, the mixture is washed with
water to remove Cs effectively.11 In addition,
we have clarified that the chemical bonding of Cs changes from Cs–O
bonding to Cs–Cl bonding upon heat treatment at 700 °C.12 Thus, Cs can be eluted into the salt from WB
and subsequently removed at low temperatures by washing away the excess
salt. Because Cs is washed away, we need to consider its effect on
the surrounding physical environment.

In this study, we have
investigated the Cs removal rate and structural
changes in WB resulting from heat treatment in the presence of added
NaCl–CaCl2 mixed salt. We analyzed the removal rate
and the structural change by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis and
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, respectively. In addition, the characteristics
of the crystal structure before and after the treatment were examined
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As a result, new crystal
phases were observed to emerge at approximately 500 °C, and Cs
was completely removed at 700 °C, where WB decomposed completely
and a pyroxene (augite) was formed. On the basis of the results, we
propose our method of Cs-free mineralization (CFM) as a new soil-decontamination
process.

Result and Discussion
The Cs/Si molar ratio obtained
by the XRF analysis is shown in Figure 1. The Cs removal
rate at 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C was 45, 47, 82, and 100%, respectively.

molar ratio at each heating temperature (no heating, 400,
500, 600, and 700 °C) determined by the XRF analysis.

The XRD pattern of the specimen heated at each
temperature is shown
in Figure 2a. The pattern
of the specimen heated at 400 °C was almost identical to that
of the specimen before heating, i.e., the Cs-sorbed WB. By contrast,
several new peaks, including those at 2θ = 29.4°, were
observed in the pattern of the specimen heat-treated at 500 °C.
Additional new peaks, including those at 33.2°, appeared after
the heat treatment at 600 °C. Furthermore, the peak at approximately
8° disappeared after the heat treatment at 700 °C. Because
this peak is the basal reflection of WB, its disappearance indicates
that the WB was completely decomposed.

These new crystalline phases were
successfully identified using
the TEM analysis (Figure 2b). The peaks that appeared in the patterns of specimens treated
at 500 and 600 °C are attributed to calcite (CaCO3) and hematite (Fe2O3), respectively. As previously
mentioned, the peaks of WB disappeared completely and a number of
intense new peaks appeared. The TEM analysis revealed numerous fine
crystals, as shown in Figure 2c. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis
in conjunction with the TEM observations indicated a composition with
Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe as the major cations. The SAED patterns obtained
from the crystals were reproduced using the cell parameters and space
group of a clinopyroxene such as diopside (CaMgSi2O6), as shown in Figure 2d,e. Hence, the crystals should be termed augite, (Ca,Na)(Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)2O6. Most of the major peaks in the XRD pattern
of the specimen treated at 700 °C were also reproduced on the
basis of this mineral (Figure 2b). The TEM analysis also revealed crystals containing Cl
as well as Ca, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, whose SAED patterns are not attributable
to augite. Moreover, unidentified peaks existed in the XRD pattern
of the specimen treated at 700 °C. These peaks are explained
by wadalite, a Ca- and Cl-bearing silicate with a nominal formula
(Ca,Mg)6(Al5Si2)O16Cl3.13 Although quantitative analysis
was not performed, augite was clearly the most abundant phase in the
specimen heated at 700 °C.

The crystal structure of augite
viewed perpendicular to the (100)
plane is shown in Figure 3a. Augite is a clinopyroxene, or single-chain inosilicate
mineral, in which the M1 site is coordinated by six oxygens, forming
a regular octahedron, and the M2 site is coordinated by eight oxygens
between the single chains of silicon or aluminum tetrahedra (T sites).14 Larger cations such as Fe2+, Ca2+, or Na+ occupy M2 sites, whereas smaller ones
such as Al3+, Fe3+, or Mg2+ occupy
M1 sites. In general, a K+ ion does not easily enter an
M2 site because its ionic radius is too large to be accommodated (Figure 3b).15 Hence, the incorporation of K+ into augite has
not been reported. Because the ionic radius of Cs+ is greater
than that of K+ (Figure 3b), Cs+ is reasonably assumed to seldom
enter the pyroxene structure, even in trace amount (Figure 3b). This situation is also
similar to that of other mineral phases (wadalite, hematite, and calcite)
formed by the heat treatment. Hence, Cs+ originally incorporated
into WB could not find a host mineral phase and vaporized or was incorporated
into the remaining salt and subsequently washed away.

of augite viewed perpendicular to the (001)
plane. The blue, yellow, and green polyhedrons are corresponding to
T, M1, and M2 sites, respectively. (b) Comparison of ionic radii of
several cations for the octahedral coordination, according to Shannon
and Prewitt.14

With regard to the process by which Cs is removed
from WB, the
formation of other mineral phases (anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) and Ca2SiO3Cl2, not determined by mineral analysis) was confirmed using XRD and
TEM analyses. The aforementioned results suggest that radioactive
Cs can be removed from contaminated soil via the phase transition
of clay minerals into different silicate minerals upon heat treatment
in the presence of additives. We propose this concept of cesium-free
mineralization (CFM) as a new decontamination process on the basis
of these findings. This process works at a considerably lower temperature
than the fusion of clay minerals, which generally requires temperatures
greater than 1000 °C. In addition, with judicious selection of
the materials used as additives, their quantities, and the heating
conditions, the contaminated soil could potentially be converted into
products that can be used industrially. The dependence of the performance
of the CFM process—specifically, the Cs removal rate, minimum
heating temperature required, and the final products—on the
nature and quantity of the additives is currently being investigated
systematically.

Conclusions
In this study, we have
investigated the Cs removal rate and the
structural change of Cs-absorbed weathered biotite (WB) by heating
it with mixed salt. The Cs removal rate reached 100% by heating at
700 °C. Structure analyses revealed complete decomposition of
WB and formation of augite and several new phases at 700 °C.
The complete removal of Cs from the specimen was ascribed to the refusal
of these new phases to incorporate Cs with a large ionic radius. We
believe that this concept, named cesium-free mineralization (CFM),
is promising for decontamination of the radioactive soil in Fukushima.

Materials
and Methods
WB for the experiment was collected from outcrops
in Ono-town,
Fukushima prefecture. The WB was ground to a fine powder, and particles
smaller than 1.8 μm were screened. The difference between the
structures of WB16 and vermiculite has
already been reported by Motokawa et al.17 Cs sorption was performed according to a well-known method. First,
clay minerals were dispersed into a 1.0 × 10–1 mol L–1 CsCl solution for 24 h with slow stirring.
The sample was then washed repeatedly with distilled water until no
free Cl was detected using silver nitrate. The sample was then dried
using a freeze-drying machine. The concentration of Cs in the WB samples
was 0.8 wt %, as determined by the XRF analysis.

We initially
added 40 mg of NaCl–CaCl2 mixed
salt with a molar ratio of 1:1 to 40 mg of WB powder and placed the
sample onto a Pt sample plate. We then added several drops of water
to the mixture and dried it by heating at approximately 80 °C.
The Pt sample plate was heat-treated at temperatures of 400, 500,
600, and 700 °C for 2 h under a reduced pressure of 14 Pa. After
natural cooling, the sample was dispersed in 10 mL of distilled water
by ultrasonication. It was then subjected to centrifugal separation
at 4000 rpm for 30 min. After the supernatant liquid was removed,
the sediment was dried on a hot plate at approximately 100 °C.

Composition analysis of the sample was performed on a wavelength-dispersion-type
XRF spectrometer (Rigaku ZSX PrimusII), and the structural analysis
was performed by XRD (Rigaku RINT2500HLB) using Ni-filtered Cu Kα
radiation. In addition, TEM analysis (JEOL, JEM-2010 operated at 200
kV) was conducted to investigate the structural change and identify
minerals formed by the treatment. In the analysis, selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) and X-ray microanalysis by energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS, JEOL JED-2200) were used to identify the mineral
phases.
