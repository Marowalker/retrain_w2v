The
appearance of foam in various industrial processes can cause
challenges. Antifoaming agents are widely added to suppress foam.
To exert a defoaming effect, affinity between the main foam-generating
component and the antifoaming agent is an important criterion for
selection of an antifoaming agent. The Hansen solubility parameter
(HSP) can be used as an index to show the affinity between substances
more quantitatively, simply, and accurately. The Hansen solubility
sphere method was used to measure the HSPs of antifoaming agents and
a foam-forming surfactant. Various antifoaming agents were added to
a surfactant solution, and the defoaming effect was evaluated. Correlations
of 0.953–0.860 confirmed a relationship between affinity of
the antifoaming agents for the surfactant based on HSP theory and
the defoaming effect. It is suggested that use of HSP as an indicator
can facilitate selection of the most suitable antifoaming agent for
the process.

1 Introduction
In the paint and food industries, among others, “foam”
appears in various processes. Foam may be effectively used in separation
operations such as flotation or foam fractionation;1 however, its appearance may also cause defects in the manufacturing
process and product quality deterioration, such as a decrease in density,
and therefore, it is often regarded as a problem. Antifoaming agents
have been widely used as additives to suppress foam in such processes.
When the component that produces the foam is a surfactant, it comprises
regularly arranged hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups that face the
liquid and air sides of a foam bubble, respectively; the forces are
balanced, thus the foam has a constant film thickness and becomes
stable. To exert an antifoaming effect, an antifoaming agent should
be introduced between the surfactant groups to inhibit stabilization
of the foam.2 The affinity between the
component that generates the foam and the antifoaming agent is very
important and is one of the criteria for selecting an antifoaming
agent.3 In general, antifoaming agents
are examined for their defoaming effect under actual conditions of
use, by considering whether their action adversely affects the process,
and selection of an antifoaming agent is usually based on empirical
data. There is a wide and diverse range of commercially available
antifoaming agents; hence, selection of the optimal reagent is often
laborious. There is a need for an effective indicator that more simply
and accurately enables selection of an antifoaming agent; thus, we
focused on use of the Hansen solubility parameter (HSP).4,5 HSP can evaluate the affinity between substances quantitatively.
Therefore, it is useful for application as an index in various systems
that show dispersion stability, solubility, and the like.6−9

The solubility parameter δ ((MPa)1/2) is
a physical
property defined by Hildebrand as an indicator of the solubility of
a material. The HSP is defined as the solubility parameter δt ((MPa)1/2) divided into three terms: a dispersion
force term, a polar force term, and a hydrogen-bonding force term.4

Three methods are used to determine the
HSP: the Hansen solubility
sphere method,4 the molecular group contribution
method,6 and a method involving calculations
using correlations between physical properties and various parameters.10 The Hansen solubility sphere method calculates
the HSP using an affinity evaluation that takes into consideration
interactions with various organic solvents. This method can be used
regardless of the state of the sample. The molecular group contribution
method involves applying parameters for various molecular groups and
is suitable for calculating the HSP of a single component with a known
structure. The physical property estimation method is used to estimate
an HSP from its correlation formulae for relationships with various
physical properties and is suitable for calculating the HSP of a liquid
sample.

In this study, the affinity between surfactant solutions
that generate
foam and various antifoaming agents was quantitatively evaluated using
HSP. By showing a relationship between the defoaming effect and the
HSP affinity, we propose the introduction of HSP theory to the industrial
selection of antifoaming agents.

2 Theory
2.1 Solubility Parameter
The Hildebrand
solubility parameter δ ((MPa)1/2) was defined by
Hildebrand as an index describing solubility, expressed in terms of
cohesive energy and molar volume. The Hildebrand solubility parameter
is calculated using the equation4,5 1  where ΔE and Vm are the cohesive energy (J) and molar volume
(cm3/mol) of a substance, respectively. The Hildebrand
solubility parameter, which represents the cohesive energy density,
has been used to evaluate the compatibilities and dispersibilities
of materials. However, it is a nonspecific physical property parameter
and does not distinguish between polar interactions, nonpolar interactions,
and other interactions; therefore, the affinity between two similar
materials, such as alcohols, cannot be appropriately evaluated, and
the parameter does not conform to theory.

To solve this problem,
C. M. Hansen divided the Hildebrand solubility parameter δ into
three components, defined by the following equations5,10 2  where 3  in which ΔEd, ΔEp, and ΔEh are dispersion
cohesion energy, polar cohesion energy,
and hydrogen cohesion energy, respectively, and δd, δp, and δh are the dispersion
force, polar force, and hydrogen-bonding force terms, respectively.
The dispersion force term δd describes general van
der Waals interactions between substances. There will be a powerful
attractive force between any two molecules that are located a fraction
of a nanometer apart. These forces are everywhere and thus tend to
be ignored, but they dominate most interactions. The polar force term
δp describes the familiar “positive attracts
negative” electrical attraction caused by dipole moments. These
forces are important for almost every type of molecule except some
hydrocarbons and certain molecules that contain only carbon and fluorine.
The hydrogen-bonding force term δh describes forces
that are arguably polar, but their predictive value goes beyond that
of simple polar forces, and therefore, they are considered to be distinct.
Hydrogen-bonding forces can generally be considered to describe electron
exchange, thus CO2 has strong hydrogen-bonding forces that
make it a good solvent.5,9,10

Quantitatively evaluating the affinity between two substances can
be achieved using Ra ((MPa)1/2), which reflects the distance between their HSPs. Ra can be calculated using the equation 4  in which subscripts 1 and 2 indicate
components
1 and 2, respectively.4,5 A smaller Ra value will indicate that the HSPs for the two substances
are similar, and the substances have more affinity for each other.

2.2 Hansen Solubility Sphere Method
The
Hansen solubility sphere method is a method for calculating HSPs from
the results of affinity evaluation tests with organic solvents. Affinities
are initially evaluated using organic solvents with known HSPs. Affinity
evaluation methods that consider compatibility, swelling properties,
and dispersibility are available. A method suitable for the sample
of interest is selected. HSPs for solvents with good and poor affinities
are plotted on a three-dimensional Hansen graph. The smallest radius
sphere (Hansen solubility sphere) is then created by ensuring that
data for the good solvent fall within the sphere and that for the
poor solvent fall outside the sphere. The center coordinates of the
sphere and give the HSP of the target substance.4,5

The HSP of a substance will generally be a single value, that is,
the Hansen solubility sphere gives one HSP. It has recently become
clear that certain substances have two types of HSP (i.e., two Hansen
solubility spheres). Abbott et al. found that a surfactant (a substance
with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties) will have both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic Hansen solubility spheres.11 Agata and Yamamoto found that an ionic liquid, which has both polar
and nonpolar components, will also have two Hansen solubility spheres.12 In summary, substances with different components
(e.g., surfactants and ionic liquids) will have two Hansen solubility
spheres, one related to each component. HSPiP software (Steven Abbott
TCNF Ltd., UK, version 5.1.07) is able to create two kinds of Hansen
solubility spheres.

2.3 Foam Formation and Defoaming
Mechanism
Foam occurs when a liquid forms a membrane that
surrounds a gas.
In pure water and pure organic solvents, foam hardly ever appears;
if foam is generated, its stability is extremely small. When a second
component such as a surfactant or polymer is added, foam tends to
develop and stabilize.3,5 As shown in Figure 1, in a surfactant solution, hydrophilic groups
are regularly arranged on the liquid side of the membrane and hydrophobic
groups on the air side; therefore, the forces on the foam surface
are balanced, so that the foam has a constant film thickness and becomes
stable. By adding an antifoaming agent, the balance of the forces
on the foam surface is broken because the antifoaming agent inserts
between the hydrophilic groups of each surfactant molecule and the
film thickness becomes uneven; as a result, the foam loses stability
and disappears. One criterion for an effective antifoaming agent is
that it can easily enter between the surfactant molecules. Its affinity
for the foam component is important in considering whether the antifoaming
agent can easily enter the foam. The affinity between the foaming
component in a process and the antifoaming agent is, therefore, an
important factor when selecting an antifoaming agent for industrial
use.2,3,5

surfactants and (b) after adding antifoaming

The nonionic surfactant,
polyoxyethylene(23)lauryl ether (PEL;
FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp., Japan), was used as the foam component.
This surfactant is a solid; therefore, we evaluated its affinity for
organic solvents by HSP measurement using a dissolution test. Ten
milliliters of each of 23 organic solvents were added to 0.3 g PEL.
The affinity was visually evaluated after allowing the mixtures to
stand for 1 h. The criteria for determining the affinity are described
in Section 4. Poor
and good solvents were judged, and HSP values were determined using
the Hansen solubility sphere method.

The antifoaming agents
(with their abbreviations given in brackets)
were KM-71 (Af: A), KM-73 (Af: B), KM-73A (Af: C), and KM-73E (Af:
D), supplied by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan and Shirikaton-SN-400A
(Af: E), supplied by Taki Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan. These are emulsion
type antifoaming agents in which silicone oil compounds are emulsified
with nonionic surfactants. The various antifoaming agents are liquids,
therefore, the compatibility evaluation method was used to determine
the affinity for HSP measurement. Two milliliters of each of the 23
organic solvents were added to 2 mL of various antifoaming agents.
After sonication for 5 min, the mixtures were allowed to stand for
24 h, and the affinity was similarly visually evaluated. Poor and
good solvents were judged from the affinity evaluation, and HSP values
were determined using the Hansen solubility sphere method. The affinities
between PEL and each antifoaming agent were compared using eq 4.

3.2 Defoaming
Tests
A surfactant solution
of 0.05% PEL was prepared with pure water. There are two methods for
adding an antifoaming agent: one is premixing in the solution and
the other is adding on top of foams, but the defoaming mechanism is
considered to be almost the same. Therefore, in this experiment, the
former was selected because of quantitative evaluation and ease of
operation. Various antifoaming agents were added to give an active
ingredient concentration of 10 ppm. After stirring each mixture for
30 min, 150 mL of the test solution was placed in a measuring cylinder
and aerated for 30 s using a fixed amount of pure nitrogen gas. The
foam height was measured at 0, 30, 90, 150, and 210 s after cessation
of aeration. The highest position reached by the bubbles was taken
as the bubble height. These experiments were performed at room temperature.

Table 2 shows the affinities of PEL and the antifoaming agents (Af) for
the various organic solvents. Figure 2 shows evaluation criteria of PEL. In the affinity
evaluation of PEL, the evaluation criteria were that the organic solvent
in which PEL dissolved completely was assigned a score of 1 and that
in which PEL was insoluble was assigned a score of zero.

Good solvents in the Hansen solubility sphere method had a score
of 1, which indicated that the affinity between PEL and the solvent
was good; poor solvents had a score of zero, which indicated that
the relative affinity was poor. The Hansen solubility sphere results
obtained using the Hansen solubility sphere method are shown in Figure 4. PEL exhibited two
spheres: one with a high δh and another with a low
δh. The HSP values of the high δh sphere were δd = 15.3 (MPa)1/2, δp = 20.2 (MPa)1/2, and δh = 20.4
(MPa)1/2. It is considered that these values represent
the hydrophilic group of the surfactant. HSP values of the low δh sphere were δd = 19.1 (MPa)1/2, δp = 9.7 (MPa)1/2, and δh = 5.3 (MPa)1/2; these are considered to indicate
the hydrophobic group of the surfactant.11

Figure 3 shows
evaluation
criteria of antifoaming agents. In the affinity evaluation of antifoaming
agents, the evaluation criteria for affinity were that a compatible
system was assigned a score of 1, while the partially miscible system
was scored as 2 and two-phase systems were scored as zero.

Figure 3 Examples of
the affinity evaluation scores for the antifoaming
agent.

Good solvents in the Hansen solubility
sphere method had scores
of 1, which indicated that affinity between the antifoaming agent
and solvent was good; poor solvents had a score of 2 and zero, which
indicated that affinity was poor. The Hansen solubility sphere results
of antifoaming agents obtained using the Hansen solubility sphere
method are shown in Figure 4. Considering the positional relationship
between the good and poor solvents, antifoaming agents D and E were
represented by two spheres. The HSP values obtained from the abovementioned
results are summarized in Table 3.

4.2 Affinity
Evaluation of Surfactant and Antifoaming
Agents Using HSP Theory
The HSP distance Ra between PEL and the various antifoaming agents was calculated
using eq 4. The results
are shown in Table 3. A surfactant forms a bubble by arranging a hydrophobic group on
the outside and a hydrophilic group on the inside; therefore, affinity
between the hydrophilic group of the surfactant and the antifoaming
agent is considered to be important in defoaming. We compared the
HSPs of PEL high δh spheres and the antifoaming agents
(high δh spheres in the case of two spheres). A smaller Ra value indicated that the HSPs for the two
substances are similar and that the substances have more affinity. Table 3 indicates that the
best affinity was exhibited by the Af: D system, with an Ra of 1.0 (MPa)1/2. Hence, it was inferred that
antifoaming agent D exerted the best defoaming effect on PEL.

4.3 Defoaming Tests
The results of defoaming
tests for the five antifoaming agents are shown in Figure 5. In the test solution with
no antifoaming agent, a slight decrease in foam height occurred immediately
after nitrogen gas aeration, but, after a lapse of time, the foam
height was stable without any change. When the antifoaming agent was
added, the initial foam height and the height measured after all elapsed
times tended to decrease. Differences were exhibited by the various
antifoaming agents: for example, the foam heights of A and B continuously
decreased immediately after addition, but those of C and E decreased
and then became constant. It is believed that this behavior is affected
by the rate of penetration of the antifoaming agent into the foam.
In addition, this is because that the ratio of hydrophilicity and
hydrophobicity in the defoamer is related. From Figure 4, Hansen solubility spheres of Af: E have
a larger interaction radius in the low δh sphere
than in the high δh sphere. In other words, it is
presumed that Af: E also has a hydrophilic property but has a relatively
dominant property of hydrophobicity. Therefore, some reduction of
foam was observed in the initial stage of addition. But the hydrophobic
part was dominant and the influence on the foam part was small, and
the height of the foam was considered to be constant as in the case
without the defoamer.

Figure 5 Changes in the foam height over time when adding various
antifoaming
agents.

The relationships between the
foam height at each time and Ra of the
antifoaming agents are shown in Figure 6. A high correlation
coefficient (R) was observed between Ra and the bubble height at each elapsed time. The best
correlation was R = 0.953 at an elapsed time of 30
s; R decreased somewhat as the elapsed time increased.
This is considered to be because of differences in foam stability
with the elapsed time, as described above, but some correlation (R = 0.860) could be confirmed even after 210 s.

Figure 6 Relationship
between the foam height and affinity (Ra) of PEL and antifoaming agents at each time.

Confirmed correlations between the antifoaming agent and PEL affinity
(Ra) and the defoaming effect at each
elapsed time suggested that evaluation of the affinity between an
antifoaming agent and the foaming liquid component by Ra using HSP can serve as a guideline for selecting the
optimal antifoaming agent for a process. Moreover, it can be predicted
that the best result can be obtained by designing an antifoaming agent
having a small Ra with the foaming liquid.

5 Conclusions
Selection of an antifoaming agent
using HSPs is discussed. The
HSP of a surfactant, which is a foam component, and antifoaming agents
were measured using the Hansen solubility sphere method, and a comparative
study of their affinities was conducted. A correlation was confirmed
between the defoaming effect and the affinity (Ra). It is suggested that use of HSP can be effective for selection
of an antifoaming agent.
