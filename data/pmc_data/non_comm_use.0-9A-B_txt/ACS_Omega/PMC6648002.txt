The number of peptide-based active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)
has increased enormously in recent years. Furthermore, the emerging
new peptide drug candidates are more complex and larger. For the industrial
solid-phase synthesis of C-carboxylic acid peptides, the two main
resins available, Wang and chlorotrityl chloride (CTC), have a number
of drawbacks. In this context, resins that form an amide bond with
the first amino acid are more robust than Wang and CTC resins. Here,
we address the use of the backbone (BAL) resin for the synthesis of
the peptide liraglutide. The BAL resin, in conjunction with the use
of pseudoprolines to avoid aggregation, allows the stepwise solid-phase
synthesis of this API in excellent purity and yield.

Introduction
Recent years have witnessed
a significant increase in the number
of peptides based on active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).1 Furthermore, during the last decade, peptides
on the market have evolved from being small and linear, with approximately
10 amino acids, to being much more complex.2 This has led to an increasing number of cyclic, longer (20–40
amino acids) peptides receiving approval from regulatory agencies.
Thus, these organisms are increasingly approving cyclic peptides,
longer peptides (20–40 amino acids), and peptides containing
fatty acids.3

Industrially, all of
these peptides are prepared at a multi-kilogram
scale using the solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) strategy first
developed by Merrifield in the early 1960s.4 The idea behind this approach is straightforward, namely the use
of a polymeric protecting group for one of the functions present in
the amino acid. The elongation of the peptide chain is then carried
out by successive introduction of the amino acid with the other function
temporally protected, removal of the temporal protecting group, and
repetition of the sequence. As the presence of the polymer makes the
growing peptide chain insoluble in the reaction medium, the work-up
is easily carried out by simple filtration and washings. This allows
the use of excesses of the incoming protected amino acid (3–5
equiv in research; 1.5 equiv in production) and of the deprotection
reagent, thus making the reaction almost quantitative in many of the
cases.

Peptides are synthesized from C to N, which implies that
the carboxylic
group of the first amino acid is protected with the polymeric support,
and the rest of amino acids are introduced through the carboxylic
group with a protected α-amino function and the side chain if
required. The C–N strategy was attempted by Merrifield5 and later by our group,6 but it is not practical because of a large number of associated
drawbacks, related mainly to poor coupling yields, the formation of
diketopiperazines (DKP) with the termination of the growing chain,
and of oxazolones with the concomitant racemization.

Most research
and industrial peptides require either a carboxamide
or a carboxylic acid at the extreme C-terminal. Rink Amide,7 PAL,8 and Sieber9 are the most widely used resins when carboxamide
peptides are desired, whereas Wang10 and
chlorotrityl chloride (CTC)11 are the resins
of choice for carboxylic acids. The precursors of cyclic peptides
are also synthesized as carboxylic acids. The CTC resin is excellent
for the synthesis of small–medium molecules, but the synthesis
of longer peptides can be jeopardized by the instability of the CTC–ester
bond.12 This limiting feature gains relevance
in an industrial context. Although the Wang resin is more stable,
the introduction of the first amino acid is not straightforward, and
the presence of free hydroxyl groups can lead to the presence of peptides
with deletion peptides as impurities in the final product.13 Furthermore, the Wang resin is susceptible to
forming DKP after the removal of the Fmoc group of the second residue.

Sieber and CTC resins allow the release of peptides using a low
concentration of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (4 and 1–2%, respectively),
which is suitable for the preparation of protected peptides. In contrast,
the other resins require high concentrations of TFA.

In terms
of robustness, the preparation of amide peptides is preferred,
due to the higher stability of the amide against the ester (DKP formation
takes place with esters and not with amides)14 and the greater ease of formation of the amide bond vs the ester.
Thus, the synthesis of Asn/Gln C-terminal peptides is best carried
out using carboxamide resins and by introducing the first amino acid
in the form of Fmoc-Asp/Glu-OtBu through the side
chain.15 Similarly, Lys can be anchored
through the ε-amino function.16 Other
trifunctional amino acids can be also anchored through the side chain.17 In all of these cases and for the preparation
of C-acid peptides, the α-carboxylic group
will be protected in the form of a tBu ester, which
is removed during global deprotection and cleavage.

Less attention
has been paid to starting the synthesis through
the backbone. This approach can be carried out using formyl trialkoxyphenyl
(BAL) resin.18 This support allows the
introduction of the first amino C-terminal amino acid through the
α-amino by a reductive amination, rendering a secondary amine,
which is in turn acylated by the second protected amino acid for the
continuation of the synthesis. It is important to highlight that using
the BAL strategy, the anchoring of the growing peptide resin is also
through an amide bond and that the treatment of the peptide–BAL
resin with TFA releases a linear peptide. The main drawback of the
BAL resin is the difficulty to acetylate the second amino acid of
the secondary amino acid. However, this acylation is performed safely
when the first amino acid is not hindered, such as for Ala, Leu, and
Phe, and in the case of Gly. Figure 1 shows the four tentative possibilities of starting
SPPS.

Figure 1 Options for resin anchoring in solid-phase peptide synthesis: C-terminal
anchoring (most used); side-chain anchoring (very useful for trifunctional
first amino acids); N-terminal anchoring (not recommended);
backbone anchoring (this work).

As the size of the peptide sequence increases, the probability
of intra- and interchain interactions rises considerably, which is
the main cause for the appearance of a large number of deletion peptides
as side products.19 Many approaches have
been developed to reduce chain interactions.19 However, when residues of Ser and Thr are present in the peptide
sequence, the use of pseudoprolines (ψ-Pros) is probably the
best approach.20 ψ-Pro is a backbone
amide-protecting group built with the hydroxyl group of Ser and Thr,
and it has a structure of dimethyloxazolidine, which allows the release
of the Ser and Thr under TFA treatment. The five-member ring is very
similar to that of Pro, thus disrupting the hydrogen bond on the backbone
and destabilizing the β-sheet folding of peptides, processes
that induce aggregation.

Within this project, we aimed to demonstrate
the feasibility of
backbone anchoring using the BAL resin in the synthesis of a difficult
and long C-terminal carboxylic acid peptide, thus avoiding the disadvantages
presented by both Wang and CTC resins. For the synthesis of C-terminal
carboxylic acid peptides, the carboxylic group of the first amino
acid was protected in the form of a tBu ester. Then,
during the TFA cleavage treatment, the traceless BAL resin would release
the peptide as a C-terminal carboxylic acid (Figure 2).

Figure 2 General example of the BAL linker use.

To evaluate our strategy, we chose
the API liraglutide, which is
currently a blockbuster sold under the name of Victoza.21 Liraglutide has a linear sequence of 31 amino
acids that is branched at the Lys27 side chain with a palmitoyl-γ-Glu
moiety (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Sequence
of liraglutide.

It is important to highlight
that a 31-amino acid peptide such
as liraglutide could represent the limit for being synthesized in
a stepwise mode (amino acid after amino acid). For peptides around
this size or longer, a hybrid (solid-phase/solution) approach should
be more appropriate.22,23

Results
As we
were targeting a long linear peptide, liraglutide, we used
the aminomethyl-ChemMatrix (CM) resin as support for SPPS. This full
polyethylene glycol support has been developed for long and difficult
peptides, thus making it the most suitable resin for the synthesis
of this 31-amino acid peptide.24 This resin
is compatible with the introduction of any of the linkers available
and also with the Fmoc/tBu strategy.

First,
the BAL linker was safely anchored to the CM resin using
DIC/OxymaPure as the coupling reagent cocktail for 4 h (Figure 4). Both the ninhydrin and the
aldehyde test confirmed that the linker was effectively anchored.
After that, reductive amination was used to introduce the C-terminal-protected
H-Gly-OtBu, using NaBH3CN as the reducing
agent. The next amino acid to be coupled, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, was initially
introduced in 90 min using DIC/OxymaPure. However, the chloranyl test
showed that the reaction was incomplete.25 Recoupling under the same conditions led to coupling completion,
as confirmed by Fmoc determination. Before continuing the synthesis,
acylation with Ac2O/diisopropyl ethylamine (DIEA) in dimethylformamide
(DMF) is highly recommended, to prevent further acylation of those
non-arginylated reactive groups that would lead to Arg-deletion peptides.

Figure 4 Initial
design of the synthetic scheme for liraglutide.

The coupling of the next 20 amino acids was carried out with
DIC/OxymaPure,
and the performance was checked by the ninhydrin test.26 To assess the correct progress of the peptide,
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of the peptide
from minicleavages (approx. 5 mg of resin) were performed every six
amino acids.

Initially, the synthesis was carried out without
the recourse of
ψ-Pro. Recouplings were established when incomplete couplings
were detected (ninhydrin positive), but the main problems arose during
the introduction of the last 10 amino acids, because they required
repetitive recouplings. We opted to explore the use of various coupling
cocktails for the introduction of amino acids 8–18 (N-terminal)
of the sequence. AA/HCTU/DIEA (3 equiv) showed the best results, without
the need of recoupling. Nevertheless, the purity continued to be unsatisfactory
(Figure 5A).

The sequence of liraglutide contains pairs of amino acids,
namely,
Gly11-Thr12, Phe13-Thr14, and Val17-Ser18, which are suitable to be
introduced as ψ-Pros in the N-terminal part of the peptide.
As such, we explored their coupling as ψ-Pros instead of individual
Fmoc-amino acids. When Fmoc-l-Val-l-Ser[ψ-(Me,Me)Pro]-OH
was used for the coupling of Val9-Ser10, the
desired product was obtained with much greater quality (Figure 5B). However, the impurities
were very close to the main peak, thus hindering the purification
step. The presence of these impurities close to the target was also
reduced when the Phe13-Thr14 pair was also introduced
as ψ-Pro (Figure 5C). When the three ψ-Pros were used, high purity was achieved
(Figure 5D). Of note,
the impurities that were difficult to remove during purification were
negligible using this approach. In addition, the overall time required
for the synthesis was reduced (Table 1).

As stated
initially, liraglutide is branched at the Lys27 side chain
with a palmitoyl-γ-Glu moiety. We expected the
presence of this long aliphatic chain to hinder the elongation of
the peptidic backbone, and so the introduction point was studied in
depth. The Lys27 residue was introduced as Fmoc-Lys(Alloc)-OH,
thus allowing us to orthogonally remove the Nε-protecting group and selectively attach the Palm moiety.
Initially, we attempted this introduction as the last step of the
synthesis, just before the final cleavage, by using Palm-Glu(OSu)-OtBu/DIEA (5/10 equiv). However, no reaction was detected
and only the starting material was recovered. This was not surprising
because, in our experience, the peptide has a great tendency to aggregate
during the introduction of the last 10 residues. We therefore decided
to focus on the amino acids that were next to Lys27, whose
sequence was -Gln(Trt)-Ala-Ala-Lys(X)-Glu(OtBu)-.
Although the intuitive point for the incorporation of the Palm moiety
could be thought to be just after the introduction of Fmoc-Lys27(Alloc)-OH, it is well known that the ε-NH2 of the Lys side chain causes the removal of the Fmoc of the α-amino
after Alloc removal. As it has been described that this premature
and undesirable Fmoc removal can also take place on one or even on
two amino acids after the Lys residue,27 we attempted to introduce the Palm moiety after the coupling of
Gln24(Trt). However, and although the reaction took place,
the conversion was not quantitative. Furthermore, given the price
of the commercial Palm-Glu(OSu)-OtBu, we decided
to optimize its introduction. In this regard, we attempted to introduce
the Palm moiety after the introduction of the two Ala residues. In
both cases, the reaction evolved slowly, but reached completion with
no secondary reactions. As the removal of the Alloc group is safer
when further away from Lys, for practical reasons, this group was
removed after the second Ala in the final liraglutide synthesis. The
presence of this large aliphatic side chain had no significant influence
on the coupling efficiency, and so the peptide elongation was performed
without further issues but did require the presence of the three ψ-Pros.

Once the peptide sequence was completed, the resin was extensively
washed with MeOH and then treated with TFA/H2O/TIS (94:3:3)
for 4 h. After precipitation, the peptide crude was analyzed, showing
outstanding purity (84%) and almost quantitative yield (Figure 6). Of note, no important impurities
were found close to the target peptide.

(A) before purification and (B)
after purification (5–100% ACN (0.1% TFA) in 10 min, 220 nm).

The peptide was finally purified
by semipreparative HPLC, rendering
liraglutide (final yield, 69%). The identity was further confirmed
by MS (electrospray and MALDI-TOF). Finally, characterization coelution
in HPLC with commercial liraglutide validated the identity of our
synthetic compound.

Discussion
In conclusion, the preparation
of peptides by SPPS can be initiated
not only by anchoring the C-terminal carboxylic group to the corresponding
resin but also by backbone anchoring. This is particularly relevant
in the synthesis of C-carboxylic acid peptides, because
the two most popular resins available, namely CTC and Wang, show several
important drawbacks. The BAL resin forms an amide bond with the first
amino acid, which is stable throughout the synthetic process, showing
no release of the peptide from the resin.

The stepwise synthesis
of medium–large peptides is often
jeopardized by intra- and interchain interactions that lead to aggregations.
However, our results show that these can be minimized by the introduction
of ψ-Pros when Ser and Thr residues are present in the difficult
part of the sequence.

The excellent synthesis of the important
commercial peptide liraglutide
using the BAL–CM resin and ψ-Pros has exemplified the
robustness of SPPS for the synthesis of large and complex peptides.28

General Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis Procedures
Peptide
syntheses were performed manually in a polypropylene syringe fitted
with a polyethylene porous disc. Solvents and soluble reagents were
removed by suction. Washings between deprotection, coupling, and subsequent
deprotection steps were carried out with DMF (5 × 1 min) and
DCM (5 × 1 min) using 10 mL of solvent per gram of resin for
each wash. Coupling of amino acids 19–37 was carried out by
adding the reagents AA/DIC/OxymaPure (0.3 M solution) in a ratio of
3/3/3 equiv and then shaking for 90 min, unless stated otherwise.
The resin was washed with DMF (5 × 1 min) and DCM (5 × 1
min) after each coupling. Couplings were monitored by the ninhydrin
test. Introduction of amino acids 8–18 (in their respective
forms) was performed by using AA/HCTU/DIEA (3 equiv) in 120 min couplings.

BAL Incorporation
The ChemMatrix resin (0.6 g) (f = 0.58 mmol/g) was washed with DCM (3 × 3 min). The
BAL linker (6 equiv 560 mg) was then coupled onto the resin with DIC/OxymaPure
(6 equiv 263 μL/296 mg) in DMF. The resin was then stirred for
4 h, followed by filtering and washing with DMF (5 × 1 min) and
DCM (5 × 1 min). The ninhydrin test was performed (negative),
and the aldehyde test (positive) confirmed that the BAL linker had
been effectively coupled.

Gly Addition by Reductive Amination
The resin was suspended
in DMF and the free amine H-Gly-OtBu (10 equiv 579
mg) was added in the form of a solution in 1% (v/v) AcOH in DMF (approx.
100 μL of AcOH per gram of resin) for 30 min prior to the addition
of a solution of NaBH3CN (10 equiv 218 mg, 300 mM) in MeOH.
The resin was shaken overnight. After that, the resin was washed with
DMF (5 × 1 min) and DCM (5 × 1 min). The reaction was monitored
by the aldehyde test (negative).29

First
Arg Acylation
Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH (3 equiv 677 mg)
was then coupled using DIC/OxymaPure (3 equiv 131 μL/148 mg)
in 45 mL of DMF as the coupling cocktail for 90 min. To ensure optimal
amino acid incorporation, the coupling of Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH was repeated
overnight. After that, a sample of loaded resin was taken to test
for proper incorporation by Fmoc determination. Finally, the Fmoc
group was removed, and the ninhydrin test was performed (positive)
prior to continuation of the peptide synthesis.

Use of Pseudoprolines
Some amino acids within the sequence
can be introduced as pseudoprolines. This makes the synthesis faster
and cleaner. However, these compounds are expensive and their use
is discouraged. Nevertheless, the introduction of the first pseudoproline
in the sequence is required to obtain good purity. If pseudoprolines
are not used and DIC/Oxyma is the coupling cocktail, recouplings will
become mandatory and, still, purity will be very low. If HCTU/DIEA
are used as coupling reagents for amino acids 11–18 with no
pseudoprolines, the product is obtained but with a large amount of
impurities.

Fmoc Determination
An aliquot of
loaded resin was washed
with DMF (3 × 5 mL) and DCM (3 × 5 mL). It was then dried
under vacuum. The dried resin (10 mg) was added to a 2 mL polypropylene
tube, 0.8 mL of DMF was added, and the resin was allowed to swell
for 10 min. Then, 0.2 mL of piperidine was added and the mixture was
shaken for 20 min. Next, 10 μL of the supernatant was pipetted
into a cuvette and diluted with 0.990 mL of DMF. The absorbance at
301 nm was determined. The piperidine–dibenzofulvene adduct
formed upon Fmoc deprotection had a ε = 7800 L/mol/cm; thus,
the loading value was determined using the Beer–Lambert law.

Fmoc Group Removal
(i) DMF (5 × 1 min); (ii) piperidine/DMF
(2:8) (1 × 1 min + 2 × 10 min); (iii) DMF (5 × 1 min).

Alloc Group Removal
(i) DCM (5 × 1 min); (ii)
Pd(PPh3)3/PhSiH (0.1:10) (2 × 10 min in
DCM); (iii) DCM (5 × 1 min).

Palm Moiety Introduction
During the synthesis, Lys27 was introduced as Fmoc-Lys(Alloc)-OH.
After removal of the
Alloc group, the resin was treated with Palm-Glu(OSu)-OtBu (5 equiv) and DIEA (10 equiv) in DCM for 16 h.

Chloranil
Test25
A piece
of resin (approx. 1 mg) was transferred to a small test tube, and
250 μL of acetone was added. Then, 50 μL of a saturated
solution of chloranil was added. The tube was shaken for 5 min at
room temperature. When free secondary amines are present, the beads
turn a strong greenish/bluish color. In the case of primary amines,
the beads become brown. No change in color is detected when there
is no free amine.

Aldehyde Test29
A few methanol-washed
beads of the resin were placed into a small test tube. The test solution
(300 μL) was added, and the tube was heated at 110 °C for
4 min (a blank control test using only the MBHA resin is advisable).

When no free CHO is present, the beads should be colorless, as
is the blank. If color appears, CHO groups are present on the resin.
The use of a microscope is recommended for low aldehyde content.

To prepare the test solution, ethanol (88 mL), sulfuric acid (9
mL), acetic acid (1 mL), and p-anisaldehyde (2.55
mL) were mixed, and the resulting solution was stored at 4 °C.
The solution can be kept for a few days, but the use of freshly prepared
solution is advisable.

Cleavage
After the peptide backbone
was finished, the
peptidyl resin was washed with DCM (5 × 1 min) and MeOH (5 ×
1 min). Cleavage was carried out with 10 mL of a mixture of TFA/H2O/TIS (94:3:3) per gram of resin for 4 h. After filtration,
the resin was washed twice with the same mixture (5 mL). The TFA solution
was concentrated to one-third and triturated. The centrifuged solid
was resolved in a solution of 3% AcOH in H2O and lyophilized.
HPLC trace showed that the crude purity of the product was 84% by
HPLC (UV detection).

Purification
The crude unprotected
liraglutide was
purified by means of semipreparative RP-HPLC [Waters (Milford, MA)
chromatography system using a Symmetry C18 (3 × 10 cm2, 5 μm) column]. Starting conditions:
95% H2O with 0.1% TFA (phase A) and 5% ACN with 0.1% TFA
(phase B). Gradient used: 3 min under starting conditions, then 1
min to 49% of B in A; after that, 5 min to 51.5% of B in A, rising
to 100% of B in 1 min and clean during 2 min before going back to
the starting material. Liraglutide elutes around minute 7 of the gradient.
