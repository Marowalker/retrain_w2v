The treatment of
propolis and poplar bud exudates with laccase
from Trametes versicolor and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
free radical increased the antioxidant activity, as evaluated by the
2,2′-diphenyl picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)- and t-butyl-OOH-induced DNA breakage comet assay analyses. The effect
was highest for shorter reaction times. Propolis showed the highest
antioxidant activity in the DPPH test, whereas poplar bud exudates
were more active in reducing the t-butyl-OOH-induced
lesions in the Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Even if the concentration
of polyphenols decreased during the oxidation, the formation of low-molecular-weight
phenols phloroglucinol 4 (1,3,5-trihydroxy benzene),
hydroquinone 5 (1,4-dihydroxy benzene), and catechol 6 (1,2-dihydroxy benzene), characterized by the radical-scavenging
activity, can account for the observed increase in the antioxidant
activity.

Introduction
Propolis is a dark-colored
resinous substance collected by Apis mellifera from various tree buds for the construction
and adaptation of nests.1−3 The composition of propolis is
chemically related to that of bud exudates from which it derives, reflecting the specificity of
the local ecological conditions.4,5 Propolis and poplar
bud exudates show antitumoral,6 antibacterial,7 anti-inflammatory,8 antiviral,9 and antioxidant properties.10−14 Phenyl propanoid acids and flavonoids (polyphenols) are mainly responsible
for the antioxidant activity.15,16 The position and stereoelectronic
properties of the substituents on the aromatic rings of polyphenols17,18 as well as the presence of catechol and pyrogallol pharmacophores
tune the antioxidant effect.19−21

The main transformations
of polyphenols during food processing
are catalyzed by phenol oxidases, such as laccases.22,23 Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2, para-diphenol, dioxygen
oxidoreductase) are multicopper enzymes that catalyze the oxidation
of four molecules of substrate through the reduction of dioxygen (O2) to water.24 They are tolerant
to non-natural media (organic solvents and ionic liquids) and resistant
to different types of inhibitors.25 Examples
of the applications of nonaqueous enzymology in the oxidation of polyphenols
with laccases have already been reported.26,27 The reactivity of laccases (E0 = 0.5–0.8
V vs normal hydrogen electrode)28 toward
high-redox-potential substrates can be increased in the presence of
redox mediators in the so-called laccase-mediator systems (LMSs).29 Redox mediators, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
free radical (TEMPO; E0 = 0.75 V),30 diffuse far away from the active site of the
enzyme in the bulk of the solution, increasing the possible biotechnological
applications.31 TEMPO undergoes a one-electron
transfer mechanism to form the oxoammonium ion intermediate.32 TEMPO-based LMSs were shown to be the best catalytic
systems in the oxidation of different recalcitrant compounds.33 LMSs oxidize polyphenols by radical cross-coupling
reactions,34 oxidative ring-opening reactions,35 and aromatic ring hydroxylations.36,37 The oxidation of catechins to theaflavins by laccases is recognized
as a model for the chemical transformation of green tea into black
tea.38 Moreover, laccases and vanillin
(i.e., a natural redox mediator) act as sensoring systems to analyze
poplar hydrolysates.39 Preliminary data
reported that the oxidation of different propolis (geographical locations
and floral origin: Livada, Carei, Cristian, Fagaras, and Gura) with
laccase from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum without redox mediators generally leads to the pro-oxidant activity
in a complex laccase–hemoglobin system. In this latter case,
the pro-oxidant activity was not correlated with the redox potential.40 We describe here that the oxidation of propolis
and poplar bud exudates with laccase from Trametes
versicolor in the presence of TEMPO increased the
antioxidant activity for a shorter reaction time, as evaluated by
the 2,2′-diphenyl picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)41 test and by the t-butyl-OOH-induced DNA
breakage in the alkaline comet assay.42 The antioxidant activity was compared with the oxidation pathway
of polyphenols because they are recognized to be the main factors
responsible for the antioxidant activity of propolis and poplar bud
exudates.43,44

Results and Discussion
Commercially
available black bud poplar exudate (Populus nigra) and propolis (from China) were extracted
with MeOH (80% v/v water) to afford PN-A and PROP samples, respectively.
The extraction of the black bud poplar exudate was also performed
with EtOH (80% v/v water) to afford PN-B. The samples were preliminarily
characterized by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
after treatment with N,O-bis-trimethylsilyl
trifluoroacetamide (NBSA) in the presence of oleic acid as internal
standard. The GC profiles of PROP, PN-A, and PN-B samples are in Supporting Information SI #1 (Figures SI1A–C). To identify the chemical structure
of polyphenols, two strategies were followed. First, the spectra of
identifiable peaks were compared with commercially available mass
spectrum libraries, such as NIST (Fison, Manchester, U.K.). In contrast,
the GC–MS analyses were repeated using commercially available
standard compounds (method of addition). Tables 1–3 report the most abundant polyphenols detected in the samples
[mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values
and the abundance of peaks of identified polyphenols are in Table SI2A; mass-to-charge ratio fragmentation
spectra of identified polyphenols are in SI #3]. We identified a large panel of compounds, including (a) phenol
derivatives: 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, salicylic acid, and vanillin;
(b) phenyl propanoid derivatives: cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid,
4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid methyl ester, 3,4-dimethoxy
cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and caffeic acid phenethyl
ester; (c) flavanons: pinostrobin, naringenin, and sakuranetin; (d)
diidro flavonols: pinobanksin and 3-O-acetyl pinobanksin;
(e) flavons: chrysin, tectochrysin, and genkwanin; and (f) flavanols:
galangin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and quercetin (only in the case
of PN-A and PN-B samples). The structures of the identified polyphenols
are presented in SI #4.

The oxidation of PROP, PN-A,
and PN-B samples was performed with
laccase from T. versicolor,45 in the presence of TEMPO.46−51 Laccase from T. versicolor showed
the optimal pH value of 5.5 and the following kinetic parameters: Km = 1.6 mM, Vmax = 1381 × 10–3 ΔAbs (min μgenzyme)−1, Vmax/Km = 8752 (average errors in the kinetic
parameters were ±2–4% for Km and ±1–3% for Vmax). Briefly,
the appropriate sample (0.1 g) was treated with laccase (10 U) and
TEMPO (6 mM) in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (3.0 mL, pH 5–5.5)
at 40 °C, in the presence of a low amount of CH2Cl2 (5.0% v/v).31 Nonaqueous enzymology
shows numerous advantages with respect to traditional conditions,
such as increased solubility of substrates, improved stability and
selectivity, and limited side reactions.52 The reaction mixtures were vigorously stirred at room temperature,
quenched after 1, 7, and 15 h, and analyzed by GC–MS. The GC
profiles at 1 h are reported in Supporting Information SI #1 (Figures SI #1D–SI #1F). The reaction mixtures quenched at 7 h were also purified by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, as selected samples) to isolate possible
degradation products. Tables 1–3 report the composition of
polyphenols in the reaction mixtures (columns 4–6). Figure 1 depicts the pattern
of different types of polyphenols at different reaction times.

Figure 1 Variation of
the concentration of polyphenols (mg/g) with the reaction
time (h) in the oxidation of PROP, PN-A, and PN-B samples with T. versicolor and TEMPO.

Regardless of the experimental conditions, polyphenols decreased
continuously during the oxidation process, reaching ca. 50% of the
initial concentration at 15 h. The PN-A sample showed a higher depletion
of polyphenols than the PN-B sample (Figure 1) probably due to the presence of an appreciable
amount of vanillin, which is a natural redox mediator for laccase.53 The general order of the reactivity of flavonoids
observed in all samples was: flavonols > flavanones, dihydro flavonols
> flavones (very low reactivity). Phenyl propanoid derivatives
were
all efficiently oxidized by laccase (Tables 1–3, Figure 1).

The high
reactivity of flavonols was in accordance with the data
previously reported for the oxidation of purified flavonoids with
laccase from T. versicolor. This latter
study highlighted the important role played by the hydroxy group at
C3 of the chromene ring in the first step of the reaction. The mechanism
requires the initial H abstraction from C3-OH followed by the formation
of a carbocation at C-2 (by dismutation reaction between two radicals),
nucleophilic addition, and rearrangement of the C-ring (see Figure 2 for the nomenclature
of the aromatic rings in flavonols).54 The
occurrence of this oxidative pathway was confirmed by the detection
of 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6-trihydroxy-3(2H)-benzofuranone 1, 2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6-trihydroxy-3(2H)-benzofuranone 2, and the galangin dimer 3 in the reaction mixtures quenched at 7 h after HPLC purification
(at a selected reaction time) (Scheme 1).54 Compounds 1 and 2 were produced by the addition of water to the
respective C2 carbocation intermediates, followed by the C-ring rearrangement,
whereas compound 3 was derived from the addition of a
second molecule of galangin on the first formed C2 galangin carbocation.54−58 Under similar experimental conditions, flavones were found to be
stable, thereby highlighting the crucial role of the C3-OH group in
the oxidation of flavonoids with laccase.59

Scheme 1 Oxidation Products Detected during the Treatment of PROP, PN-A,
and
PN-B Samples with T. versicolor and
TEMPO
Simple low-molecular-weight
phenols phloroglucinol 4, hydroquinone 5, and catechol 6 were also
detected in appreciable amounts by GC–MS analyses (Tables 1–3, Figure 1, and Scheme 1). Phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxy benzene) is usually produced
during the degradation of the A-ring of kaempferol and naringenin
by oxidative metabolism.60,61 Moreover, 2,4,6-trihydroxy
benzoic acid, which is a chemical precursor of phloroglucinol by decarboxylation,
was obtained by the treatment of quercetin with the peroxyl-radical-generating
agent, azobisisobutyronitrile.55 Hydroquinone
(1,4-dihydroxy benzene) and catechol (1,2-dihydroxy benzene) have
been observed during the oxidation of flavonoids and other complex
phenols.62 The concentration of compounds 4–6 was highest at 7 h of the oxidation
(Figure 1).

The
antioxidant activities of the PROP, PN-A, and PN-B samples
before and after the treatment with laccase were initially evaluated
by the DPPH radical-scavenging analysis.63 Briefly, the appropriate sample was dissolved in EtOH (0.01–100
mg/mL) and added to a freshly prepared DPPH solution (6 × 10–5 M in EtOH). The decrease in absorbance (475 nm) was
determined at different times until the reaction reached a plateau.
The kinetics of the process was analyzed for each concentration tested,
and the DPPH activity remaining at the steady state was estimated.
This value was used to calculate IC50 (i.e., the concentration
of substrate in milligrams per milliliter that causes 50% loss of
the DPPH activity).64 PROP showed an IC50 value (110 μg/mL) of the same order of magnitude as
Brazilian, Korean, and Australian red propolis (Table 4, entry 1).65,66 The IC50 values of the PN-A and PN-B samples were higher than those
of PROP (300 and 290 μg/mL, respectively) and similar to those
of Populus tremula and P. nigra (337 and 485 μg/mL, respectively).67 Irrespective of the nature of the sample, the
DPPH antioxidant activity increased during the first hour of the treatment,
reaching the lowest IC50 value (35 μg/mL) in the
case of PROP (Table 4, entry 2). For a longer reaction time, a progressive increase in
the IC50 values was observed (Table 4, entries 3 and 4).

was performed in
triplicate.

To have a more
realistic scenario of the complex interactions within
the cell in biological systems, the PROP and the more DPPH-active
PN-A samples were selected for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity
in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Mammalian cells are endowed
with several levels of defense mechanisms against oxidative damage,
the first of which is based on the quenching of reactive oxygen species
by antioxidants, such as ferritin and ceruloplasmin.68 The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ability to
reduce the extent of DNA breakage [single-strand breaks (SSBs)] induced
by tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (t-butyl-OOH),
using a slightly modified version of the alkaline comet assay, which
is a rapid and sensitive procedure to quantify DNA lesions in mammalian
cells.69,70 The frequency of SSBs of DNA and “alkali-labile
sites” was measured immediately after the treatment and at
different recovery times in CHO, with and without pretreatment with
the samples. This technique detects both SSBs and the so-called alkali-labile
sites, which are observed as SSBs after denaturation under alkaline
condition (both types of lesions will be referred to as SSBs because
real SSBs and alkali-labile sites in this assay cannot be distinguished).
The results obtained in control cells and in cells pretreated with
the samples after treatment with t-butyl-OOH are
reported in Figures 2 and 3. Pretreatment with the samples alone
did not increase the TM values (i.e., the product of the tail length
and the fraction of total DNA in the tail), suggesting the absence
of pro-oxidant activity in the samples after the laccase treatment,
whereas the presence of t-butyl-OOH significantly
enhanced the frequencies of SSBs, as shown by the increase of TM.
The kinetics of the repair of the oxidative DNA damage was assessed
at 0, 0.5, and 1 h after treatment with t-butyl-OOH
(with or without pretreatment with the selected samples). We observed
a statistically significant reduction in the mean TM in the presence
of PROP with respect to t-butyl-OOH, except for the
sample treated at 15 h. In particular, the most effective compound
in reducing the t-butyl-OOH-induced DNA damage was
PROP after 7 h of treatment with laccase (Figure 2).

Figure 3 Mean TM values obtained at different recovery
times for both control
and t-butyl-OOH-treated samples with and without
pretreatment with PN-A. Student’s t-test,
§ t-butyl-OOH vs control, p < 0.01; * PN-A 1, 7, and 15 h vs t-butyl-OOH, p < 0.01.

In a similar way, we observed a statistically significant
reduction
in the mean TM in the presence of PN-A treated with laccase for short
time compared with t-butyl-OOH alone. In this latter
case, the most effective compound in reducing the t-butyl-OOH-induced DNA damage was the PN-A sample after 1 h of treatment
(Figure 3).

Conclusions
In conclusion, polyphenols decreased during the treatment of propolis
and poplar bud exudates with laccase from T. versicolor and TEMPO. Phenyl propanoid acids and flavonoids (with the only
exception of recalcitrant flavones) were efficiently oxidized. Low-molecular-weight
phenols hydroquinone, catechol, and phloroglucinol were produced as
degradation products during the first period of the oxidation, in
addition to some flavonol derivatives modified on the C-ring.71 The antioxidant activities of propolis and poplar
bud exudates did not display a reactivity-related similarity to the
trend of polyphenol derivatives. The antioxidant activity increased
immediately (from 0 to 7 h) and then decreased rapidly for higher
reaction times. In the mammalian cells (comet assay), t-butyl-OOH markedly induced primary damage, whereas pretreatments
with propolis and poplar bud exudates did not have effects on the
DNA integrity, indicating the absence of pro-oxidant effects. The
comet assay data clearly indicated that the samples treated with laccase
and TEMPO were able to enhance significantly the extent and the rate
of DNA repair of t-butyl-OOH-induced lesions. A marked
protection against the oxidative DNA breakage was observed for PN-A
(treatment at 1 h) and PROP (treatment at 7 h). On the basis of these
data, the enhancement of the antioxidant properties of propolis and
poplar bud exudates after treatment with laccase and TEMPO could be
reasonably attributed to the formation of hydroquinone, catechol,
and phloroglucinol because of their ability to scavenge radical species,72−75 even if a general modulatory effect on the endogenous antioxidant
systems of the cell cannot be completely ruled out.76 Noteworthy, the PROP sample showed the highest antioxidant
activity in the DPPH test, whereas PN-A was most effective in the
comet assay, confirming a different responsiveness of the mammalian
cells with respect to the DPPH analysis.

Laccase from T. versicolor (Sigma-Aldrich)
is a monomer, organized in three sequentially arranged domains with
a molecular mass of approximately 62–70 kDa, having dimensions
of about 6.5 nm × 5.5 nm × 4.5 nm and isoelectric point
of 4,2.77,78 TEMPO, tert-butyl-hydroperoxide
(t-butyl-OOH) [75-91-2], and organic solvents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Commercially available black bud poplar
exudates (P. nigra) and propolis were
obtained from Shaanxi Teng Yun Biotechnology Co. Ltd (Lianhu District,
Xian, China). All spectrophotometric measurements were made with a
Varian Cary 50 UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with a single-cell
Peltier thermostated cell holder. Spectrophotometric data were analyzed
with Cary UV software. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
GC–MS analysis was performed using a combined LC–GC–MS
instrument by Varian. The following are the parameters used for the
analysis: SLB-5ms capillary GC column; film thickness, 30 m ×
0.25 mm × 0.25 mm (Supelco-28471-U); flow velocity of the carrier
(helium), 1.0 mL min–1; column gradient temperature,
140 °C (2 min) to 300 °C (5 min) at the rate of 5.0 °C
min–1; and injection temperature, 250 °C. The
analysis was performed using an electron impact ion source (70 eV)
and interface (transfer-line temperature) of 250 °C. The MS Data
Review software was applied for the remote control of the instrument.
The HPLC analyses were performed by Agilent 1260 Infinity II DAD Detector
equipped with a Capcell Pak C18 column. The NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrophotometer.

Preparation of Propolis
and Poplar Samples
Raw propolis
and poplar (10 g) were manually ground, pretreated with petroleum
ether to remove resins (600 mL, 6 h at 45 °C), and extracted
in Soxhlet with MeOH (80% v/v water) or EtOH (80% v/v water) at reflux
temperature for 48 h. The obtained macerate was removed by filtration,
and the solid portion was discarded. The recovered extract was distilled
under reduced pressure (650 mmHg, 80 rpm) to yield PROP and PN-A/PN-B
samples. For the GC–MS analysis, the appropriate sample (10
mg) was treated with 300 μL of NBSA (stabilized with 1% trimethylchlorosilane)
in 100 μL of pyridine, in the presence of oleic acid as internal
standard at 90 °C for 2 h.

Treatment of Propolis and
Poplar Samples with Laccase from T. versicolor and TEMPO
The activity of
laccase from T. versicolor was determined
spectrophotometrically using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid (ABTS) as a substrate. Briefly, ABTS (300 μL, 5 mM) and
sodium acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5, 2.6 mL) were incubated under vigorous
stirring at 40 °C for 10 min. Then, an appropriate amount of
laccase in the sodium acetate buffer (100 μL) was added to the
mixture and the initial rate was immediately measured with an increase
in the optical density at 436 nm. One activity unit (U) is defined
as the amount of enzyme that oxidized 1.0 μL of ABTS per minute.
The kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, Vmax/Km) were determined by measuring the enzyme activity at
different concentrations of ABTS (0.1–5 mM) and plotting the
data in a double-reciprocal Lineweaver–Burk plot. The reaction
was carried out by the same procedure as for the activity assay, using
laccase (0.1 μg) and measuring the absorbance at 436 nm, as
described above.79 The appropriate sample
(1.0 g) and TEMPO (6 mM) were treated with laccase (100 U) in 0.1
M sodium acetate buffer (10 mL, pH 5–5.5) in the presence of
a low amount of organic solvent CH2Cl2 (5.0%
v/v). The amount of TEMPO was selected on the basis of data recently
reported on the use of the LMS for the oxidation of recalcitrant aldehydes.31 At defined reaction times (1, 7, and 15 h),
the reaction was extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (30 mL ×
2). The organic layers were treated with a saturated solution of NaCl,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and then filtered
and concentrated under vacuum to yield the crude to be analyzed, as
previously reported for parent substrates.

In the case of the
reactions quenched at 7 h, the crude was purified by HPLC using a
procedure previously reported for the isolation of flavonol derivatives,
with some modifications.80 The operating
conditions were as follows: MeCN/H2O (30%) containing 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid; flow rate, 0.8 mL/min; and UV detection at 254
nm. The retention times of compounds 1–3 were identified by co-injection with standard compounds.54 NMR data of compounds 1–3 were consistent with those reported previously.80

Antioxidant Activities of PROP, PN-A, and
PN-B Samples as Evaluated
by the DPPH Method
The quantitative assessment of the antioxidant
activity of propolis and poplar samples was performed with a slight
modification of the procedures reported in the literature.81 EtOH was used as blank. The inhibition of free
radical DPPH by the samples was monitored by measuring the decrease
in the absorbance of solutions with different concentrations. In particular,
the sample at an initial concentration of 1.0 mg mL–1 was diluted with ethanol until it achieved final concentrations
of 25.0, 15.0, 10.0, 5.0, and 2.5 μg mL–1.
Then, 1.0 mL of 0.3 mM DPPH in ethanol was added to 2.5 mL of the
appropriate solution and they were left to react in dark at room temperature
(26 °C) over 30 min. The absorbance readings were then taken
with a spectrophotometer at 518 nm. To make the results more reliable,
the measurements were performed on five different concentrations of
the same sample and, for each concentration, three readings were taken.
The antioxidant activity was expressed as the IC50 value.
The results were expressed as the obtained values plus standard deviation
(SD) of three independent experiments for each extract analyzed. The
results were statistically processed through the GraphPad Prism 5.1
software.82

Antioxidant Activities
of PROP, PN-A, and PN-B Samples as Evaluated
by the Comet Assay
CHO cell line was cultured in Ham’s
F10 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine (Lonza), and 1%
streptomycin and penicillin (Lonza) at 37 °C in a humified atmosphere
of 95% air and 5% CO2. Moreover, to eliminate variations
due to culture conditions, control and treated cultures were maintained
concurrently and the same batches of the culture medium and preparation
methods of chemicals were used for each experiment. t-Butyl-OOH (tert-butyl peroxide) was diluted with
distilled water at the appropriate treatment concentration and used
freshly made. In particular, a dose of 500 μM was used. The
samples were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 500 μg/mL.
For the experiments, the stock solutions were diluted with DMSO at
the appropriate treatment concentration of 100 μg/mL and used
freshly made.

Cell Treatments with t-Butyl-OOH
and Selected
Compounds
Briefly, the cell lines were seeded at a density
of 5 × 105 cells/mL in Ham’s F10 complete medium
and pretreated with the selected compounds (100 μg/mL) for 3
h at 37 °C. The cells were exposed to t-butyl-OOH
for 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the oxidative
agent, and suspended again in Ham’s F10 complete medium. The
treated cells were used for the comet assay (t =
0, 1/2, and 1 h). All of the doses used here were chosen on the basis
of pilot experiments.

Single-Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) Analysis
(Comet Assay)
The standard alkaline (pH > 13) SCGE, or
comet assay, analysis
was performed as described earlier under visible fluorescent light.83 After the treatment, the cells were collected
and processed for the assay. In short, 20 μL of the cell suspension
(5 × 105 cells) was mixed with 80 μL of 0.75%
low-melting-point agarose in PBS at 37 °C and immediately pipetted
onto a frosted glass microscope slide precoated with a layer of 1%
normal-melting-point agarose, similarly prepared in PBS. Two slides
for each experimental point were then incubated in a lysis solution
(2.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl, 100 mM EDTA, pH 10, with 1% Triton
and 10% DMSO freshly added) for 1 day at 4 °C. After lysis, the
slides were placed on a horizontal electrophoresis unit containing
fresh electrophoresis buffer (1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH, pH 13) and incubated
for 15 min to allow unwinding of DNA. Electrophoresis was then conducted
for 20 min at 25 V, 300 mA, and 4 °C. Subsequently, the slides
were gently washed three times in a neutralization solution (0.4 M
Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) for 5 min and fixed in fresh 100% methanol
for 3 min. The slides were stained with 50 μL of ethidium bromide
(20 μg/mL) and covered with a coverslip. The stained nucleoids
were examined at 400× magnification with an automatic image analyzer
(Comet Assay III; Perceptive Instruments, U.K.) connected to a fluorescence
microscope (Axioskop 2; Zeiss). To evaluate the amount of DNA damage,
computer-generated TM values and percentages of DNA damage were used.
For each experimental point, 100 cells were scored from two slides,
for a total of 200 cells. The significance of the induction of mean
TM in the effect of the t-butyl-OOH treatment versus
that in control samples and the effects of the oxidative agent under
different experimental conditions (i.e., with and without propolis
or PN-A) were analyzed by Student’s t-test
for paired samples (p < 0.01). The results are
represented as the mean ± standard error of repeated experiments.
