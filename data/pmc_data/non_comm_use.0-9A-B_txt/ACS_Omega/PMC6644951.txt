Novel waterborne UV-curable hyperbranched
polyurethane acrylate/silica
(HBWPUA/SiO2) nanocomposites were prepared by a three-step
procedure and sol–gel method. 1H NMR and 13C NMR results indicate that HBWPU is successfully synthesized. Surface
tension and contact angle tests both demonstrate the good wettability
of the nanocomposites. Besides, the kinetics of photopolymerization
of HBWPUA/SiO2 films were analyzed by attenuated total
reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which reveals
that the modified SiO2 could accelerate the curing speed
of HBWPUA coatings. Thermal gravity analysis indicates that the HBWPUA/SiO2 hybrid films have a better thermal stability than the pure
HBWPUA cured films. Furthermore, the hybrid films show enhanced pencil
hardness, abrasion resistance, and adhesion. On the basis of the above,
HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites were finally applied to waterborne
UV-curing flexographic printing ink, which is printed on poly(ethylene
terephthalate) and glass. The nanocomposite presents good rheological
behavior because the ink has a lower Z0, a higher Z∞, and the viscosity
rebuild time is 375 s. Three colors (red, yellow, and blue) of ink
were used to test its printing quality, the curing time was below
30 s, and the adhesion was excellent without being stripped. All of
the inks show good water resistance and abrasion resistance. Moreover,
the red and blue inks possess better solid densities than the value
of 1.07 of yellow ink, and are 1.83 and 1.84, respectively. The current
study suggests that the process has promise in applications of food
packages.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Flexographic printing,
which is environmental friendly, has become
the second largest printing method in European and American countries,
and it is the fastest growing printing method in the world.1 Currently, flexographic printing has been widely
applied in various fields, such as packaging materials, magazines,
miscellaneous pieces of printing sectors, etc. The flexographic printing
ink can be divided into three categories: solvent ink (most are linear
polymer), water-based ink, and UV-curing ink,2 which are all widely used. However, solvent-based flexographic printing
ink has a particularly stimulating odor, causing environmental pollution
and threatening human health, and water-based flexographic printing
ink has some problems like weak mechanical properties, slow drying
rate, and paper shrinkage defects. Besides, the traditional UV-curable
ink also has some disadvantages: the UV ink needs a reactive diluent
to decrease its viscosity, which increases its toxicity. The waterborne
UV flexographic ink with waterborne UV-curable resin as binder, which
combines advantages of both the UV ink and water-based ink, has great
rheological properties and can be cured at ambient temperature by
short exposure to UV light, earning it more and more attention.

At present, linear polymer solvent-based ink is mainly used in
flexographic ink, it has a high viscosity, slow dry rate, and moreover,
the use of active diluent is also harmful to the environment and human
health. Therefore, the development of a green, low viscosity, fast
drying, and high quality flexographic ink is particularly important.
Hyperbranched polymer has aroused attention in recent years; it was
firstly reported by Flory.3 In recent years,
it has gained increasing attention as a novel type of binder material
for waterborne UV-curable ink. Compared to its linear counterpart,
hyperbranched polymer displays low viscosity, high activity, good
oxygen resistance ability, and excellent compatibility because of
its highly branched structure, low degree of intermolecular entanglement,
and a great number of end functional groups, which can be produced
for large-scale application with improved properties.4−9 Geiser et al.6 prepared the thermoplastic
hyperbranched polyurethanes with Boltorn H30, which acts as a precursor.
Mishra et al.10 illustrated the synthesis
of UV-curable hyperbranched polyurethane acrylate/ZnO hybrid coatings
and studied their thermal, viscoelastic, and surface morphology properties.
In 2014, Ren and Liu11 introduced the research
and development process of linear waterborne polyurethane UV flexographic
ink applied to label printing (patent no. 201310178593.6, China) with
fast curing rate, good intermiscibility, and improved adhesion, pencil
hardness, and abrasive resistance. Overall, the research of waterborne
UV flexographic printing ink is still in the knowledge accumulation
stage, the in-depth and comprehensive research on its application
has yet to start.

Organic/inorganic nanocomposites can be compounded
through physical
action between the inorganic and organic surfaces (van der Waals force
and hydrogen bond) or chemistry (covalent bonds, coordination bond,
etc.) at the nanometer level.12 Organic–inorganic
hybrid materials have undergone rapid development in recent years
because of their good mechanical properties, wear resistance, and
thermal stability,13 where the hyperbranched
polymer gives flexibility and toughness and the inorganic part acts
as filler in different polymer matrices giving hardness, durability,
high thermal stability, and other superior mechanical properties.14,15 At present, they are widely used in light-emitting materials, biodegradable,
smart packaging materials, and other fields. Geiser16 prepared UV-curable HBPUA/SiO2 by a physical
blending method using acrylic acid, Blotorn H30, and nano-SiO2 as raw materials, which can be used in coatings. Tests showed
that the nano-SiO2 system has a small influence on the
curing process, and can reduce the curing shrinkage rate of the system.

To sum up, the waterborne UV flexographic ink prepared in this
article can be applied in food packaging as it is environmentally
friendly and has excellent properties including low viscosity, high
activity, good compatibility, and energy saving.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization and Properties
of HBWPUA/SiO2 Nanocomposites
Usually, waterborne
UV ink consists
of binder, pigment, solvent, additives, and so on, of which the binder
occupies the most proportion and is the most critical component, thus
it has a great impact on the many properties of ink. Therefore, the
preparation of binder is particularly important. In this section,
many tests were carried out to confirm the successful synthesis and
properties of the HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites, which acts
as the binder in waterborne UV flexographic ink.

2.1.1 NMR
Analysis
The NMR spectra of
the first to fourth generations of HBWPU are shown in Figures 1 and 2, and these are based on tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard
and heavy water as the solvent. They were measured at room temperature.
The peaks of the first to fourth generations of HBWPU are at δ
= 1.21 ppm (−NHCOO−), δ = 2.16 ppm (−CH2CH2−), and δ = 2.83 ppm (−OH).
As they have similar H atoms in their chemical environment, different
generations of HBWPU have the same peaks in similar locations, which
is in accordance with the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra.
Furthermore, the heights of the peaks present regular change: with
the increase of generations, the overall changes are that the heights
of the peaks at δ = 2.16 ppm (−CH2CH2−) and δ = 2.83 ppm (−OH) decrease and then increase;
the peak at δ = 1.21 ppm (−NHCOO−) exhibiting
sustained growth, meanwhile, moves left after the first reaction.
The decrease in height of the peak at δ = 1.21 ppm (−NHCOO−)
may result from the remaining hydroxyl of the PEG-400 continuing to
react in the next stage, and the increased number of terminated hydroxyls
may cause the following increase of height of the peak at δ
= 1.21 ppm (−NHCOO−), indirectly showing the existence
of the hyperbranched structure. Besides, its left chemical shift may
be explained by the hydrogen atoms in the carbonate generating a hydrogen
bond with the carboxyl group because of a hydrogen bonding effect,
which results in an increase of chemical shift; the carbonate groups
of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-400 and 2,2-dimethylol propionic acid
(DMPA) participating in the reaction may lead to the decrease in height
of the peak at δ = 2.16 ppm, which then shows significant growth
because of the polycondensation reaction of the product mentioned
above. The peak at δ = 1.21 ppm comes from the carbonate, which
proves the existence of the branched structure in the hyperbranched
waterborne polyurethane (HBWPU), and the growth of their peak heights
in turn proves that the higher the generation is, the more macromolecular
the chain will be.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra of different generations of
HBWPU.

Figure 2 13C NMR spectra of HBWPUA.

The degree of branching (DB) of
the hyperbranched polyester was
calculated from 13C NMR spectroscopy (shown in Figure 2) with reference
to three compound models possessing branched units, a linear unit,
and a terminal unit, respectively.14 The
peaks at 154.61, 155.68, and 156.63 ppm are the branched units, the
linear unit, and the terminal unit, respectively. According to its
integral area and the formula: DB = (D + T)/(L + D + T), the DB of the final product can be calculated.17

Therefore, the above results obtained by 1H NMR spectroscopy
confirm the formation of HBWPU as a branched structure. Further, from 13C NMR spectroscopy, the degree of branching was calculated,
which is 0.402. Next, we used infrared analysis to confirm whether
the SiO2 is successfully introduced.

2.1.2 Infrared Analysis
FTIR spectra
of the 2,4-diisocyanatotoluene–2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (TDI–HEA),
HBWPU, HBWPUA, and HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites are shown
in Figure 3, traces
(a)–(f). From spectrum (a) of TDI–HEA, the characteristic
peaks of N–H stretching vibration, −NCO, C=O,
N–H bending vibration, and C–O could be found at 3342,
2274, 1727, and 1540 cm–1, respectively. The peaks
at 1632, 1409, and 810 cm–1 associated with the
double bond indicate the existence of an acrylate group. The two peaks
of 2920 and 2860 cm–1 are attributed to the C–H
stretching vibration of alkane. The FTIR spectra of HBWPU and HBWPUA
are shown in traces (b) and (c), respectively. Spectrum (b) with no
absorption peak at 2274 cm–1 showed a broad terminal
hydroxyl group at 3448 cm–1 and −NHCON–
at 1655 cm–1, suggesting that all −NCO groups
were consumed and HBWPU had been synthesized. Compared with spectrum
(b), peaks at 1641, 1409, and 806 cm–1 were characteristic
of the acrylate group in spectrum (c). Furthermore, the peak at 2274
cm–1 disappeared due to −NCO in trace (c),
revealing that the reaction between TDI–HEA and HBWPU had completed.18

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of TDI–HEA, HBWPU, HBWPUA, and hybrid
film:
(a) TDI–HEA, (b) HBWPU, (c) HBWPUA resin, (d) HBWPUA emulsion,
(e) HBWPUA cured film, and (f) HBWPUA/SiO2 cured film with
4 wt % SiO2.

The HBWPUA and HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites are
shown
in traces (d)–(f). The characteristic absorption of C=C
at 1639 cm–1 is prominent in spectrum (d), but disappeared
in spectrum (e) of the HBWPUA cured film, which indicated that after
being exposed to UV irradiation, C=C completely participated
in radical polymerization. From spectrum (f) of the cured hybrid film
with 4 wt % SiO2, the peaks at 1092 and 804 cm–1, which are the characteristic absorptions of the asymmetric and
symmetric stretching vibrations of Si–O–Si, respectively,
became stronger. Moreover, a new peak appeared at 471 cm–1, which was attributed to the bending vibration absorption of Si–O–Si,
indicating that SiO2 could be successfully introduced into
HBWPUA and then form a network structure with the help of methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane
(MPTS), as desired through this method.

The successfully introduced
SiO2 can enhance the hardness
and abrasion resistance of binder, thus enhancing the performance
of waterborne UV ink.

2.1.3 Kinetics of Photopolymerization
Analysis
For UV-curing products, FTIR spectroscopy is a method
to measure
the change of the absorption peak of C=C bonds and further
characterize the UV-curing process, which is one of the most important
parameters of curing kinetics. The kinetics of photopolymerization
reactions of HBWPUA were studied by attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR
(Figure 4a); the spectrum was recorded every 3 s and the gel
content (Figure 4b) of the HBWPUA/SiO2 hybrid films at different
curing times was 300 μm thick. Figure 6a shows that the C=C bond peaks of
the ATR-FTIR spectrum in the 1635 cm–1 region disappeared
gradually with the extension of curing time under UV exposure. When
the curing time is 6 s, the C=C bond peak nearly disappears.
Also, the gel content of all the hybrid films rises rapidly at first,
and then slowly approaches a constant value with the extension of
curing time (Figure 4b). These results both imply that C=C bonds participate in
radical polymerization by UV radiation constantly until they are almost
used up. In addition, the curing speed and gel content of the hybrid
films increase with increasing SiO2 content. When the SiO2 content is increased to 6 wt %, the curing speed declines
slightly and its final gel content is close to that of the hybrid
film with 4 wt % SiO2. This phenomenon can be explained
as follows: nanoparticles usually absorb UV light. The increasing
SiO2 content will add more free radicals to the system.
The greater amount of C=C bonds leads to a faster curing speed
and greater cross-linking density, resulting in the increase in gel
content. When the SiO2 content reaches 6 wt %, excessive
free silica will be spread around the polymer, creating a shielding
effect for UV light, and this SiO2 will also compete with
2959 for UV light, which might slow down the curing speed to some
degree.19

Figure 4 ATR-FTIR spectra (a) of the HBWPUA film
and gel content (b) of
the hybrid films at different curing times.

2.1.4 Wettability and Hydrophobicity of HBWPUA/SiO2 Film
The polymeric binder of waterborne ink should
have a good wettability for substrates during the printing process,
and a favorable hydrophobicity to resist adverse conditions after printing. Typically,
the wettability and hydrophobicity of the polymer is usually measured
by surface tension (σ) and contact angle (θ), respectively. Figure 5 shows that σ
decreased first and then increased with the increase of SiO2 mass content. The nanocomposites with 2 and 4 wt % SiO2 content had better wettability than pure HBWPUA according to the
smaller σ, and the polymer had better wettability.20 This might result from the addition of SiO2 modified by MPTS, leading to more polar groups going into
the hyperbranched chains, which increased the volume and quantity
of polar groups, thus making σ smaller.21 But, when the wt(SiO2)% was 6%, σ increased due
to SiO2 coagulation.21Figure 5 also shows that
θ rose with the increase of SiO2 mass content, and
when the wt(SiO2)% = 6%, θ reached 94.12°. The
reason for this phenomenon might be that the more modified SiO2 was introduced, the more cross-linking density and siloxane
hydrophobic groups will be induced, which made θ bigger, improving
the hydrophobicity of the hybrid films.

curve and contact angle (θ) of
HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites with different SiO2 mass contents.

and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curve
of HBWPUA/SiO2-0% (a) and HBWPUA/SiO2-4% (b).

2.1.5 Thermal
Stability
Figure 6a,b demonstrates the thermogravimetric
and first derivative TG thermograms of HBWPUA/SiO2-0% and
HBWPUA/SiO2-4% cured films, respectively. The TG and DTG
curves of HBWPUA/SiO2-0% and HBWPUA/SiO2-4%
cured films suggest the cured films had a similar process of thermal
decomposition, which appears as three obvious weight loss regions.
The initial region occurred below 250 °C due to evaporation of
solvent in the cured films. The second weight loss region occurring
around 250–350 °C may be assigned to the decomposition
of urethane linkages. And the third region occurring around 350–500
°C may be related to the decomposition of the organic portion
of the polymer attached to the inorganic moiety. The degradation process
is illustrated by maximum peak temperatures of the three regions of
the HBWPUA/SiO2-0% and HBWPUA/SiO2-4% hybrid
films at 195, 301, and 433 °C, and 203, 310, and 438 °C,
respectively. The characteristic decomposition data implies that the
HBWPUA/SiO2-4% hybrid films have a better thermal stability
than the pure HBWPUA/SiO2-0% cured film, which may be because
the addition of SiO2 can increase the cross-linking density,
and SiO2 also causes a “barrier effect” that
delays the volatilization of degraded product, all of which are responsible
for giving an improved thermal stability.22,23

2.1.6 Mechanical Properties
The results
of Table 1 display
the effect of SiO2 mass content on the surface properties
of the HBWPUA/SiO2 hybrid films, such as pencil hardness,
abrasion resistance, and adhesion. With the increase of SiO2 mass content, the pencil hardness distinctly improved, the abrasion
resistance became better first and then decreased slightly, and the
adhesion was slightly reduced from grade 0 to 1. The reason for this
may be due to both the increase of Si–O–Si inorganic
network and cross-linking density by the addition of SiO2, which improves the hardness and abrasion resistance. However, excessive
SiO2 aggregating on the HBWPUA surface causes reduced cross-linking
density and volume shrinkage of the cured films, which lead to the
abrasion resistance and adhesion decreasing slightly.21 The pencil hardness, abrasion loss rate, and adhesion of
the HBWPUA/SiO2-4% hybrid film are 4 H, 0.92%, and grade
0, respectively.

Table 1 Surface Property Data of HBWPUA/SiO2 Hybrid Films
sample code	pencil hardness
(H)	abrasion
resistance (abrasion loss rate, %)	adhesion
(grade)	
HBWPUA/SiO2-0%	2	1.34	0	
HBWPUA/SiO2-2%	3	1.03	0	
HBWPUA/SiO2-4%	4	0.92	0	
HBWPUA/SiO2-6%	5	1.19	1	
From the tests above, we can conclude that the hyperbranched structure
is confirmed and the SiO2 is successfully introduced into
HBWPUA. Moreover, the HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites have good
curing kinetics properties, excellent wettability, and thermal stability,
which also lays the groundwork for the good performance of UV flexographic
printing ink.

2.2 Properties of the Waterborne
UV Flexographic
Printing Inks
2.2.1 Rheological Behavior
of Inks
A
good ink should have a lower zero shear viscosity (Z0) and a higher infinite shear viscosity (Z∞), so that the ink can have good fluidity in the
printing process and a good ability to avoid ink dot expansion after
printing.24 Typically, waterborne UV flexographic
ink behaves like Newtonian fluid with viscosity in the range of 100–1000
mPa s–1. Figure 7a shows that the viscosity of ink will decrease with
increasing content of HBWPUA/SiO2, which can be explained
by the fact that viscosity is affected by intermolecular forces.25,26 The higher the HBWPUA/SiO2 content, the lower the number
of particles in the multiunit system, causing less twine and physical
interaction between particles, which decreases the viscosity. With
the increase of shear rate, at first, the ink remains stable like
Newtonian fluid, and then the viscosity decreases and the ink behaves
like pseudo-plastic fluid, finally approaching a constant value. This
is because the viscosity of ink is also related to the molecular arrangement.
At low shear rates, network structures of HBWPUA molecular chains
and modified SiO2 chains with HBWPUA can be rebuilt rapidly
after being slightly damaged to achieve a balance, thus leading to
stable viscosity. As the shear rate increases, damaged network structures
cannot be fully rebuilt, and the molecular chains are forced to reorient
and arrange, thus thinning the viscosity, which is beneficial to ink
transfer during printing. But, when the shear rate is large enough
to damage all network structures, making it impossible to rebuild
the structures, the viscosity reaches the lowest and constant value.27

Figure 7 Viscosity vs shear rate dependencies measured for flexographic
printing red inks with different contents of HBWPUA/SiO2 binder (a) and dyes (b).

As also shown in Figure 7, viscosity increases with the addition of dye, and
all inks
show three stages of viscosity, like the binder, with the increase
of shear rate. This is mainly related to the dispersion state of dyes
in ink. Dyes can be uniformly dispersed in HBWPUA/SiO2 to
form condensate at high-speed stirring, and the higher the dye content,
the greater the condensate. Therefore, the viscosity almost remains
unchanged due to the stable condensate at lower shear rates, and with
the increase of shear rate, it gradually becomes thinner owing to
the smaller damaged condensate. Finally, the viscosity will slowly
become closer to a stable value because of balance occurring between
the damaged and rebuilt condensate.28

In addition, viscosity decreases when ink is transferred from printing
plate to substrate, and rebuilds after being transferred to the substrate
to ensure good printing quality, without ink overspilling, namely,
ink thixotropy. Generally, the viscosity of ink decreases rapidly
and rebuilds slowly. Therefore, the rebuild time of viscosity can
be used to characterize the ink thixotropy (as shown in Figure 8). The longer the rebuild time,
the stronger the thixotropy, and strengthened thixotropy may cause
incomplete ink delivery.24Figure 9 shows that the rebuild time
of all ink viscosities is in the range of 200–500 s. As shown
in Figure 9a, with
the addition of HBWPUA/SiO2, the rebuild time extends,
which means that the thixotropy becomes stronger. The higher the HBWPUA/SiO2 content, the weaker the force of the network structure in
the multiunit system. So, the damaged network structure at high shear
rate (1000 s–1) was restored more slowly in a sudden
return to the low shear rate (0.1 s–1), leading
to a longer rebuild time with stronger thixotropy. Also, Figure 9b displays the rebuild
time shortens with the increase of dye, causing weak thixotropy. This
is because the condensate of ink was larger with the increase of the
dye, and the force of the condensate was stronger. Thus, the damaged
condensate at 1000 s–1 shear rate can be easily
restored to a new condensate when returned to 0.1 s–1 shear rate with a greater chance of particle collision, resulting
in a shorter rebuild time with weaker thixotropy. Figures 7 and 8 show that waterborne UV flexographic red ink including 70% binder
and 14% dye displayed a lower Z0 and a
higher Z∞ with 375 s viscosity
rebuild time.

Figure 8 Ink thixotropy characterized with rebuild time of viscosity.

Figure 9 Viscosity vs time of three-step shear rate dependencies
measured
for flexographic printing red inks with different contents of HBWPUA/SiO2 binder (a) and dye (b).

2.2.2 Influence of Dye on Solid Density and Curing
Time of Inks
Dye, as a coloring material, can absorb UV light,
determines the printing solid density of ink, and also influences
the curing process of ink. Figure 10a displays the UV–vis spectrum of red, yellow,
and blue dye with the same content (0.0003 wt %). All of them use
deionized water as solvent. In comparison with the red and blue dye,
yellow dye has a stronger capacity for UV absorption with minimum
UV transmittance and maximum UV absorbance, causing a big influence
on UV-curing rate.29 In addition, the UV
absorbance increased with the increase of dye. Therefore, it is better
to have less dye to ensure a solid density. Generally, the solid densities
of red, yellow, and blue ink are required to be 1.8, 1.0, and 1.8,
respectively.29Figure 10 also shows the dependence of solid density
and curing time of flexographic printing red (b), yellow (c), and
blue (d) inks on dye content. With the addition of dye, the solid
densities of the three inks increased, but when the dye content increased
to a certain value, the solid density increased slowly. The reason
for that is because the dye oil absorption value is constant, and
binder with predetermined content accommodates a limited number of
dyes.30 Furthermore, the curing time of
inks become longer with the increase of dye. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the higher the dye content, the harder it is for UV
light to penetrate the ink film, leading to a reduced curing rate.

spectrum of dyes with the same content (a), and influence
of dye content on solid density and curing time of flexographic printing
ink: red (b), yellow (c), and blue (d).

2.2.3 Printing Quality of Inks
In this
work, the properties were tested after being printed on poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) and glass. The print quality of three kinds of
ink (Table 2) was measured
by curing time, solid density, gloss, water resistance, and mechanical
properties of printing. On the basis of the enhanced properties of
binder, the prepared ink shows a shorter UV-curing time, better abrasion
resistance, excellent water resistance, and stronger adhesion. Moreover,
the printing solid density and gloss effect become more ideal.

Table 2 Print Performance and Mechanical Properties
of Red, Yellow, and Blue Waterborne UV Flexographic Inks
 	printing quality	
tested performance	red ink	yellow ink	blue ink	
curing
time (s)	27	30	30	
solid density	1.83	1.07	1.84	
gloss (%)	79.6	70.7	72.4	
water resistance (loss rate, wt %)	0.1870	0.1930	0.1850	
adhesion (grade)	0	0	0	
abrasion resistance (loss rate, wt %)	0.0181	0.0183	0.0180	
We can learn from Table 2 that the waterborne UV flexographic ink
using HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites as binder can show enhanced
rheological behavior
and printing quality, which is an important property of ink, and forms
a good foundation for research of its potential application in food
packaging.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, the waterborne UV-curable HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites
were successfully prepared and applied to flexographic ink as binder.
Through 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis, the degree
of branching of hyperbranched polyester was calculated, which is 0.402;
TG and DTG curves of HBWPUA/SiO2 cured films where silica
content was 2 and 4 wt % demonstrated that the hybrid films show a
better thermal stability than pure HBWPUA cured films, and better
wettability was observed after analyzing the σ data. Furthermore,
the effect of SiO2 content on surface properties of HBWPUA/SiO2 hybrid films was measured, such as pencil hardness, abrasion
resistance, and adhesion, and therefore, we can give the conclusion
that the films have better adhesion, especially when the silica content
is 4%, the abrasion loss rate is the lowest at the same time. Furthermore,
the waterborne UV-curable flexographic ink possesses excellent rheological
behavior, such as the rebuild time of viscosity.

In the meantime,
the printing quality using the optimized formulation
shows better performance. The rheological properties of red waterborne
UV flexographic ink were studied using a rotational rheometer. Results
show that the shear viscosity of red ink shows three different “zones”
of change when the shear rate ranges from 0.1 to 1000 s–1, which is beneficial to transfer ink. Moreover, the best red, yellow,
and blue pigment contents were determined to be 14, 12, and 14%, respectively.
Besides, the three different colors of ink in the optimized formulation
all have a shorter curing rate, higher printing solid density, and
water resistance, pencil hardness, adhesion, and abrasion resistance.

Waterborne UV-curable HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites in
this article are nontoxic, and on the basis of the performances above,
we can further explore their potential application in food packaging.
Because this is the first time that HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites
have been successfully applied to printing inks, there is also more
work on printability to be done in the future.

of HBWPUA/SiO2 Nanocomposites
4.2.1 Preparation
of HBWPUA Emulsion
The emulsion was synthesized via a three-step
procedure in a 1000
mL four-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a motor stirrer,
an inlet of dry nitrogen, a constant pressure dropping funnel, and
a reflux condenser with a drying tube. The process of synthesis (shown
in Figure 11) is described
in the following paragraphs.

Figure 11 Synthesis scheme to prepare HBWPUA and HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites.

In the first step, hyperbranched waterborne polyurethane
(HBWPU)
was obtained with acetone and the coupling monomer method by reacting
PEG (39.36 g) with TDI (37.68 g) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 60
°C for 2 h with continuous motor stirring in the presence of
DBTDL (four drops). Specifically, TDI was added dropwise at a constant
flow rate to avoid imploding and agglomeration. Next, DMPA (6.60 g)
dissolved in NMP (20.00 g) was added into the flask and reacted at
70 °C for 2 h. At that moment, the isocyanate (−NCO) content
was tested by the standard dibutylamine back-titration method and
found to be 3.15%. After being cooled down to −4 °C in
a low temperature constant temperature bath, DEOA (5.32 g) dissolved
in NMP (20.00 g) was dropped slowly into the reaction vessel with
continuous motor stirring at −4 °C and kept for 40 min.
Afterwards, the mixture was heated to 65 °C for 3.5 h, and then
HBWPU was acquired. At that moment, the −NCO content that was
determined by the infrared spectroscopy method was close to zero.

In the second step, semiterminated TDI–HEA with a light
curing group was prepared with a one-step method by reacting TDI (7.00
g) and HEA (5.56 g) at 45 °C for 4 h under continuous magnetic
stirring until the −NCO content reached half that of the original,
which was determined by the di-n-butylamine titration
method. The solvent and the catalyst are acetone and hydroquinone,
respectively.

In the third step, a HBWPUA emulsion was formed
with the anionic
self-emulsifying method. The hyperbranched waterborne polyurethane
acrylate (HBWPUA) resin was synthesized by adding dropwise TDI–HEA
(24.00 g) into HBWPU at 65 °C for 4.5 h with continuous motor
stirring until the peak at 2274 cm–1 for −NCO
groups completely disappeared. After cooling the HBWPUA resin to 35
°C, a mixture containing TEA (5.60 g), absolute ethyl alcohol
(32.00 g), and deionized water (128.00 g) was dropwise added with
high-speed motor stirring (300–800 rpm) to make the HBWPUA
resin fully neutralized and emulsified. One hour later, a stable HBWPUA
emulsion was obtained.

4.2.2 Preparation of HBWPUA/SiO2 Nanocomposites
HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites
were formulated by the sol–gel
method with the addition of aqueous colloidal silica and MPTS successively
to the HBWPUA emulsion at room temperature for 1 h under vigorous
stirring (800–1300 rpm).

4.2.3 Preparation
of HBWPUA/SiO2 Film
By varying the contents of
aqueous colloidal silica and MPTS in
the HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites over the range of 0, 2,
4, and 6 wt %, a series of nanocomposite films were prepared by the
following method and coded as HBWPUA/SiO2-0%, HBWPUA/SiO2-2%, HBWPUA/SiO2-4%, and HBWPUA/SiO2-6%, respectively. Photoinitiator 2959 (3 wt %) was added to different
amounts of HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites, the mixtures were
blended at room temperature for 15 min with ultrasonic cleaner and
then spread on clean slides and PET films, then they were left for
10 min at room temperature, and after that they were dried at 105
°C for 30 min to ensure the complete removal of water. After
cooling to room temperature, the films were irradiated using a full
automatic UV-curing machine at room temperature, and then demoulded
for properties measurement (shown in Figure 12).

binder.

4.3 Preparation
of Waterborne UV Ink for Flexographic
Printing on Food Packaging
The waterborne UV ink for flexographic
printing on food packaging was prepared by mixing HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites as binder, dye (red, yellow, and blue) (Shenzhen
Yonghui pigment Technology Co. Ltd., China), photoinitiator 2959,
cosolvent (ethanol and water), monomer (pentaterythritol triacrylate
(PETA)), and assistant (defoamer) for 1 h with continuous motor stirring,
grinding for 2 h with a planetary ball mill, and homogenizing with
ultrasonic cleaner for 15 min at room temperature. The dye was obtained
by high-speed dispersion of the HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites
and dyes for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:3 dye to binder mass
ratio. Furthermore, red, yellow, and blue, three kinds of waterborne
UV flexographic ink formulations were screened (shown in Table 3).

4.4 Characterization
1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra of HBWPU and HBWPUA samples were recorded
on a Mercury VX-300 MHz (Varian) and a AV 400 MHz (Bruker, Switzerland)
spectrometer in chloroform-d and deuterium oxide,
respectively. Me4Si (TMS) is the internal standard at room
temperature. For FTIR analysis, HBWPU, HBWPUA, and HBWPUA/SiO2 samples were prepared by drying the emulsion on a KBr wafer
and FTIR spectra were obtained with a iS10 spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) by scanning 16 times within a spectral range of
400–4000 cm–1. For cured films, an affix
of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) was necessary. Mean particle
sizes of the HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposites were measured at
25 °C by a BT-90 laser particle size instrument (Dandong Bettersize,
China).

Kinetics of the curing process were studied by ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy and a gel content test.31 The
gel content was calculated by eq 1. 1  where “m0” is the mass of the cured film and “m1” is the mass of the cured film after
extracting
for 48 h in a soxhlet extractor with acetone.19

The contact angle and surface tension were obtained by using
an
A10 dynamic/static surface/interface tension instrument (Kenuo Industries
Ltd.); surface tension was obtained by the Wilhelmy Plate method.

The thermal decomposition profiles of the HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposite
films were studied by a TG and DTG Setsys16 (Aetaram,
France). Approximately 5 mg of the sample was heated at a constant
rate of 10 °C min–1 in an inert nitrogen atmosphere
from 20 to 600 °C. Optical properties were characterized by a
UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) in the 300–800
nm region. Pencil hardness of the HBWPUA/SiO2 nanocomposite
films and coated waterborne UV flexographic inks was measured with
a QHQ hardness tester (Jingke, China) according to GB/T 6739-2006
standards of China. Adhesion was test by a QFH paint film scriber
(Aice, China) in accordance with GB/T 9286-1998 standards. Abrasion
resistance was studied through the rotating abrasive rubber wheel
method according to GB/T 1768-2006 standards and calculated with eq 2(19) 2  where “S” is
abrasion loss rate, “S0”
and “S1” are the mass of
films before and after 500 abrasion cycles at 500 g load, respectively.

After setting the appropriate printing pressure, the printing process
was conducted by a printability tester C1-5 (IGT, Holland). A soda
glass substrate was sonicated with deionized water for cleaning, and
PET was purchased from Hubei Yunhe Salt Packing Co., Ltd. without
further cleaning.

Solid densities of waterborne UV flexographic
inks were measured
by a Spectra Eye spectrophotometer (Gretag Macbeth, America) at the
following settings: D50 illuminant using a 2° observer, 45°/0°
(DIN5033) measuring geometry. Gloss was measured by a WGG-60 microgloss
meter (Shanghai INESA Physical Optical Instrument Co., Ltd., China)
according to GB/T 132.17.2-2009. Rheological behavior (viscosity and
thixotropy) of the waterborne UV flexographic inks was investigated
using a Kinexus Pro+ rotational rheometer (Malvern, England)
equipped with a CP1/60:PL60 (a 60 mm diameter 1° angle cone over
a 60 mm plate) at 25 °C. The shear viscosity testing was performed
with a controlled applied shear rate increasing from 0.1 to 1000 s–1, and the thixotropy was measured by a peak hold step
test and characterized with time of the third step shear viscosity
rebuild to the first step shear viscosity, where the three-step shear
rate and test time were 0.1, 1000, 0.1 s–1, and
30, 30, and 600 s, respectively.18
