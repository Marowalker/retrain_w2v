In this study, natural clay (NC)
was collected from Saudi Arabia
and modified by cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) at different conditions
(CAPB concentration, reaction time, and reaction temperature). NC
and modified clay (CAPB-NC) were characterized using X-ray diffraction,
thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption
at 77 K. The adsorption efficiency of NC and CAPB-NC toward Pb2+ and reactive yellow 160 dye (RY160) was evaluated. The adsorption
process was optimized in terms of solution initial pH and adsorbent
dosage. Finally, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were studied.
The results indicated that NC consists of agglomerated nonporous particles
composed of quartz and kaolinite. CAPB modification reduced the specific
surface area and introduced new functional groups by adsorbing on
the NC surface. The concentration of CAPB affects the adsorption of
RY160 tremendously; the optimum concentration was 2 times the cation
exchange capacity of NC. The equilibrium adsorption capacity of CAPB-NC
toward RY160 was about 6 times that of NC and was similar for Pb2+. The adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order
kinetics for both adsorptive. RY160 adsorption on CAPB-NC occurs via
multilayer formation while Pb2+ adsorption on NC occurs
via monolayer formation..

Introduction
Water resources are
indispensable for life and biodiversity conservation
and human development. Regrettably, humans’ industrial and
agricultural activities have caused a serious degradation in the quality
of water resources.1,2 Although a number of effective
regulations aim to guarantee safe disposal of industrial effluents,
over 80% of global wastewater is still disposed of without appropriate
treatment.1 These effluents represent a
serious threat to humans and ecosystem because of the presence of
hazardous chemicals such as potentially toxic metals and organic dyes.3

Potentially toxic metal contaminants are
a widespread and long-lasting
environmental problem that has drawn the scientists’ attention
worldwide because of their persistency, nonbiodegradability, bioaccumulation,
and toxicity.2,4,5 Lead
(Pb2+) is one of the most prevalent hazardous contaminants
in aquatic systems. Pb2+ contamination results from industrial
processes (such as painting, electroplating, and battery manufacturing)
and corrosion of the old lead-containing plumbing systems.4,6 The high toxicity of Pb2+ makes it one of the most toxic
metal contaminants in aquatic environments and can induce considerable
permanent damage to humans and the environment. Exposure to Pb2+ at levels >15 μg/L may cause abortion, stillbirths,
sterility, neonatal deaths, and intellectual disability.6 Even at low levels, Pb2+ can cause
behavior, liver, hearing, learning, and cognition disorders.2,4,5

On the other hand, synthetic
dye contaminants are now an emerging
area of study owing to their effects on humans, aquatic systems, and
biodiversity.7 Synthetic dyes are extensively
used in several industries such as textile dyeing, leather tanning,
paper printing, color photography, pharmaceutical, food, cosmetics,
and plastic.3,8,9 Among
the different classes of synthetic dyes, azo dyes are the largest
and the most commercially important one. They represent 70% of the
worldwide production of synthetic dyes.8,9 Regrettably,
they have poor exhaustion properties;9 about
15% are wasted during the industrial processes and contaminate aquatic
systems.3,8,9 Introducing
azo dyes into the aquatic system degrades its quality via reducing
sunlight penetration, dissolved oxygen, and photosynthesis efficiency.1,3,8,9 The
azo group plays a key role in the functions and environmental behavior
of azo dyes. First, it, along with the complex aromatic structure,
makes azo dye degradation difficult; consequently, azo dyes accumulate
in the aquatic systems, and they will persist in the environment for
long time in the absence of appropriate treatment.8,9 Second,
it renders the azo dyes high toxicity, so even small amounts of dyes
are toxic to aquatic organisms. In addition, exposure to azo dyes
can lead to allergy, skin and eye irritation, mutation, cancer, and
dysfunction of the kidneys, reproductive system, liver, brain, and
central nervous system.1,3,8,9

For these reasons, the removal of
Pb2+ and azo dyes
from water resources is an urgent need to conserve the human life
and biodiversity. Among the several water treatment methods, adsorption
has been widely applied to remove potentially toxic metals and azo
dyes.10 The adsorbent is a key factor in
the adsorption process; it defines the adsorption capacity, rate,
and cost. Reducing the cost and maintaining high adsorption capacity
can be realized by using low-cost materials or their modified forms.
Several low-cost materials have been used as adsorbents for water/wastewater
treatment.11−17 Natural clays (NCs) have acquired scientists’ attention for
remediation and containment of pollutants. They are characterized
by their abundance, nontoxicity, low cost, porosity, thermal stability,
and ion exchange capacity.18 Several structural
and surface modifications of the raw clay can be pursued to enhance
its efficiency in the removal of pollutants.

In this context,
this study aims to utilize an abundant and inexpensive
NC for treating water polluted by potentially toxic metals or azo
dyes. Pb2+ and reactive yellow 160 (RY160) were selected
as models for potentially toxic metals and azo dyes, respectively.
NC was modified by the zwitterionic surfactant cocamidopropyl betaine
(CAPB). Although there are a number of studies on the modification
of clay with surfactants,19−25 to the best of our knowledge, the effects of modification reaction
time and temperature on the adsorption performance have not been explored
yet. This study tackles this gap in the literature by investigating
the effect of modification reaction time and temperature along with
the concentration of CAPB on the adsorption efficiency. NC and modified
clay (CAPB-NC) were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and N2 adsorption
at 77 K. The adsorption efficiency of NC and CAPB-NC (at optimum conditions)
was compared. The best adsorption conditions (solution initial pH,
contact time, and adsorbent dosage) and kinetic and equilibrium studies
were also applied.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
Cation Exchange
Capacity (CEC)
CEC of a clay plays
a vital role in its adsorption capacity. Also, investigating the CEC
enables better understanding of the adsorption mechanism. The net
amounts of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ released from NC are 0.26, 0.50, 3.21, and 5.49 mequiv/100
g, respectively, with a total CEC of 9.45 mequiv/100 g. Therefore,
the above-mentioned cations can be exchanged by metals during the
adsorption process. The value of the total CEC is in line with those
of Ecuadorian kaolinite,26 Brazilian kaolinite,26 and Malaysian quartz-rich kaolinite.27

XRD Crystalline Phase Identification
The XRD diffractograms
of NC and CAPB-NC are shown in Figure 1. NC has reflection peaks at 2θ = 20.8°
(4.2 Å), 26.6° (3.3 Å), 36.5° (2.4 Å), 39.4°
(2.2 Å), 40.2° (2.2 Å), 42.3° (2.1 Å), 50.1°
(1.8 Å), 54.8° (1.6 Å), 59.9° (1.5 Å), 68.1°
(1.3 Å), and 75.6° (1.2 Å), which are characteristic
for quartz (JCPDS no. 46-1045). The reflections at 2θ = around
12.2° (7.2 Å), 19.8° (4.4 Å), 24.9° (3.5
Å), 34.9° (2.5 Å), 38.4° (2.3 Å), 45.7°
(1.9 Å), 62.1° (1.4 Å), and 64.0° (1.4 Å)
indicate the presence of kaolinite (JCPDS no. 29-1488). Accordingly,
it can be concluded that NC is mainly composed of quartz and kaolinite.
The quantification of the phase’s percentage indicates that
quartz was the dominant phase (89.52%), while kaolinite was the minor
phase (7.11%). The XRD patterns of CAPB-NC prepared at different conditions
are very similar to that of NC. This observation indicates that the
modification of NC by CAPB did not cause any changes in the clay fraction
diffractogram.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of NC and CAPB-NC.

Arrangement of CAPB and NC in the CAPB-NC Samples
The
potential of CAPB intercalation between the interlayer of the NC was
investigated using the XRD technique. According to XRD analyses, modification
by CAPB did not change either the d(001) values or
the intensity of the reflection peaks. Thus, CAPB molecules are not
intercalated into the interlayer of NC but adsorbed on its surface.
Kaolinite, the minor component of the NC, is a nonswelling layered
clay mineral consisting of silica and alumina and develops intrinsic
negative surface charge at its edge surface.28,29 The length of the alkyl chain of CAPB, the exchangeability of interlayer
cations, and/or the nonswelling nature of kaolinite could hinder the
intercalation of CAPB into kaolinite interlayers. On the other hand,
the surface charge of kaolinite could promote the adsorption of CAPB
on the surface via electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the driving
forces for the adsorption of CAPB on NC could be electrostatic attraction
between the positively charged group of CAPB and negative surface
of NC. Similar trend has been reported before. For example, Liu et
al. reported that the modification of a commercial vermiculite with
the amphoteric surfactants dodecyl dimethyl(3-sulfonate)ammonium and
dodecyl dimethyl(N-carboxylate)ammonium occurs via
adsorption on the surface not via intercalation into the interlayer.20 Similarly, Mudzielwana et al. found that the
cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide gets adsorbed
on the surface of South African natural kaolin clay and did not intercalate
into the layers.30 Also, Jin et al. concluded
that the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride covers
the surface of a commercial kaolinite and did not enter into the layers.31

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The TGA
profiles of NC and
CAPB-NC are displayed in Figure 2. Generally, the structure of clay materials has three
types of water molecules: (a) physisorbed and interlayer water: these
are loosely bound and mobile and removed below 200 °C; (b) water
molecules in the first coordination sphere of the interlayer ions:
these are strongly bonded and are removed at 300–500 °C;
and (c) structural hydroxyl groups: these dehydrate at 500–800
°C.22,32 In this study, NC shows the aforementioned
three weight loss events; specifically, loss of physisorbed water
and volatile matters (below 200 °C), slow dehydration of coordinated
water (200–400 °C), and dehydroxylation of the crystal
network (400–600 °C). Modifying NC with CAPB has a significant
effect on the TGA profile. First, the mass loss below 200 °C
decreases as the CAPB concentration increases because of the removal
of physisorbed water during modification.24,33 Second, the two decomposition events at 200–400 and 400–600
°C overlap and the mass loss above 200 °C increases significantly
with increasing CAPB concentration. Finally, the total mass loss steeply
increases with increasing CAPB concentration, indicating the successful
modification of the clay.

Figure 2 TGA curves of NC and CAPB-NC.

On the other hand, it is argued that because there are three
types
of binding between the modifier and clay (surface adsorption, interlayer
adsorption, and intercalation), the modifier would decompose at different
temperatures.24 In the current study, both
NC and CAPB-NC show the same decomposition events, and no additional
decomposition events were observed in the TGA curves of CAPB-NC, indicating
that only one type of binding between CAPB and the clay takes place.
Combining this observation with XRD results, it can be inferred that
CAPB is adsorbed on the surface of NC.

The amount of CAPB incorporated
into CAPB-NC was estimated by subtracting
the mass loss at 200–600 °C from NC to CAPB-NC.22,34 CAPB represents about 0.8, 1.8, 3.6, and 7.7 m % of the whole CAPB-NC
mass of CAPB-NC0.5-60-24, CAPB-NC1-60-24, CAPB-NC2-60-24, and CAPB-NC4-60-24, respectively.

Morphological Analysis
The morphologies
of NC and CAPB-NC
are shown in Figure 3. Both NC and CAPB-NC presented large agglomerated particles built
up of smaller nonporous particles. The agglomerated particles have
irregular shapes and uneven sizes. Similar morphology for Chilean
kaolin has been reported before.35 The
surface of NC is rough and contains numerous interparticle cavities
(Figure 3a). Such surface
is favorable for adsorption because of the predicted high surface
area and ease of pollutant diffusion through cavities.36 In contrast, the surface of CAPB-NC is smooth
with less interparticle cavities (Figure 3b). Therefore, the surface area of CAPB-NC
is predicted to be less than that of NC. It is obvious that the surface
of CAPB-NC was wrapped by a layer of the CAPB surfactant, which indicates
the adsorption of CAPB molecules on the surface of NC. This observation
is in support of the aforementioned XRD and TGA findings. The adsorption
of CAPB on the NC surface occurs via two consecutive mechanisms: first,
electrostatic interaction between the positively charged quaternary
ammonium ions of CAPB and the negatively charged surface of NC and
second, hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl chains of CAPB.
Liu et al.20 reported similar behavior
upon modifying vermiculites by amphoteric surfactants.

and CAPB-NC (b).

Textural Characteristics
Figure 4 shows the
nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms and the pore size distribution curves of NC and CAPB-NC.
The NC adsorption isotherm (Figure 4a) presents a sharp knee and unrestricted adsorption
up to high p/po. Therefore,
the NC adsorption isotherm can be classified as type II according
to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification.37 Type II adsorption isotherm is typical for nonporous
or microporous materials and indicates multilayer N2 adsorption.
On the other hand, the CAPB-NC2-60-3 adsorption
isotherm (Figure 4a)
has no knee, and the amount of N2 adsorbed remains finite
at p/po = 1. Thus, the
CAPB-NC2-60-3 adsorption isotherm is type
III based on the IUPAC classification.37 Type III is characteristic of nonporous or macroporous solids. Both
NC and CAPB-NC2-60-3 adsorption isotherms
present type H3 hysteresis loop which is given by either nonrigid
aggregates of platelike particles or macropores partially filled with
a pore condensate.37 The pore size distribution
curves (Figure 4b)
indicate that the pores of NC and CAPB-NC2-60-3 have average sizes of 7 and 2 nm, respectively. Thus, both NC and
CAPB-NC2-60-3 are mesoporous; however, CAPB-NC2-60-3 is narrower. The calculated SBET and total pore volume (Vtot) of NC are 28 m2/g and 0.06 cm3/g, respectively.
This value of SBET is higher than the
values reported for other NCs26 and comparable
to others.24,27 The SBET and Vtot, 2 m2/g and 0.01
cm3/g, respectively, of CAPB-NC2-60-3 are substantially lower than that of NC.

isotherms (a) and the
NLDFT/GCMC pore size distribution analyses (b) of NC (red lines) and
CAPB-NC2-60-3 (black lines). Closed symbols
indicate adsorption, and open symbols indicate desorption.

Correlating the results of textural analysis and FE-SEM indicates
that NC and CAPB-NC are basically nonporous particles which agglomerate
into larger particles having mesoporous structures resulting from
the interparticle void spaces. The adsorption of CAPB on the surface
of NC leads to clogging the interparticle void spaces and makes the
surface of CAPB-NC smooth; consequently, it decreases the specific
surface area, total pore volume, and average pore size. Similar trend
has been documented in the literature.20,24

FTIR Spectral
Analysis
Figure 5 depicts the FTIR spectra of NC and different
CAPB-NC samples. The absorption band at 3697 cm–1 is assigned to combined in-phase and out-of-phase stretching frequency
of hydroxyl groups of kaolinite.26,38 Bands around
3438 and 1625 cm–1 are attributed to adsorbed water
stretching and bending vibration, respectively.26 The bands at 2970 and 2920 cm–1 are attributed
to the asymmetric stretching vibration of C–C in the alkyl
chain, while the bands at 2856 and 1390 cm–1 are
attributed to the symmetric stretching and bending mode, respectively,
of the same group.24,39 The intense band at 1045 cm–1 with a shoulder at 1090 cm–1 is
ascribed to perpendicular stretching vibrations of the Si–O–Si
group, while the bands at 685 and 468 cm–1 are the
bending mode of the same group.25,26,40 Absorption bands at 920 and 534 cm–1 are ascribed
to Al(IV)–OH and Si–O–Al(VI) stretching vibrations,40 respectively. The band at 790 cm–1 corresponds to Si–O symmetric stretching.40

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of NC and CAPB-NC.

Comparing the spectra of NC and different CAPB-NC samples shows
the existence of the same bands in all samples. This observation indicates
that the structure of NC was maintained unchanged after CAPB modification.
Also, an obvious increase in the relative intensities of the absorption
bands at 3438, 2970, 2920, 2856, and 1390 cm–1 after
CAPB modification can be observed. This increase in the case of the
absorption band at 3438 cm–1 could be due to overlapping
of the N–H stretching of CAPB and the adsorbed water stretching.
It has been reported that the N–H stretching vibrations overlap
with the adsorbed water stretching and cannot be separately detected.41,42 On the other hand, the relative increase in the intensity of the
absorption bands related to C–C in the alkyl chain is indicative
of highly ordered chains of methylene groups and proves the presence
of CAPB and the successful interaction between NC and CAPB during
the modification process. Similar behavior has been reported for other
organically modified clays.21,22,25,43

Adsorption Properties
The isometric substitution in
the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the NC endows it negative
charge.19 This negative charge, along with
the CEC and pore volume of the NC, makes it a very effective adsorbent
of potentially toxic metal cations.18 Modifying
NC with cationic or zwitterionic surfactants occurs via replacing
the inorganic cations of the NC with the quaternary ammonium cations
of the surfactant.44 Modification with
long carbon chain zwitterionic surfactant such as CAPB makes the NC
hydrophobic,44 enables the adsorption of
nonionic organic compounds (via partitioning into the alkyl chain
of CAPB), and had little, if any, effect on their CEC (because CAPB
carries both a cationic and an anionic group, each exchanged site
on the NC will be replaced by an exchangeable site on the CAPB molecule).23

Effect of CAPB Modification Conditions on
the Adsorption Properties
Figure 6 displays
the time-course variation of the adsorption efficiency as a function
of CAPB concentration and modification reaction time and temperature.
The R % of the RY160 dye increases as the concentration
of CAPB increased from 0.5 to 2 times the CEC of NC (Figure 6a). Further increase in CAPB
concentration has an insignificant effect on the removal of the RY160
dye. The CAPB molecule contains a quaternary ammonium group, a carboxylate
group, and a secondary amide group (Table S1). The modification of NC with CAPB occurs via replacing the inorganic
cations of NC with the quaternary ammonium group of CAPB.44 Thus, each exchanged site on the NC will be
replaced by a carboxylate group and an amide group, that is, the potential
adsorption sites are increased. At acidic conditions, both the carboxylate
and amide groups become protonated and electrostatically attract the
negatively charged sulfonate (−SO3–) groups
of RY160. Increasing the concentration of CAPB results in an increase
in the amount of CAPB adsorbed on the NC surface; consequently, the
adsorption sites increase, leading to an increase in the R % of the RY160 dye. Similar behavior has been reported before.19,20 To acquire the best adsorption efficiency and reduce the cost of
modification, the sample prepared with CAPB concentration 2 times
the CEC of NC was selected as the optimal.

Figure 6 Adsorption characteristics
of CAPB-NC prepared at different modification
conditions. CAPB concentration (a) RY160 and (b) Pb2+;
reaction time (c) RY160 and (d) Pb2+; and reaction temperature
(e) RY160 and (f) Pb2+. Experimental conditions: RY160; Ci 20 mg/L, dosage 2.5 g/L (the dose for the
CAPB concentration test is 5 g/L), pHi 2. Pb2+; Ci 20 mg/L, dosage 0.5 g/L, pHi 6.2.

Figure 6e shows
that increasing the modification reaction temperature to 60 °C
caused an increase in the R % of the RY160 dye, which
could be due to an increase in the amount of CAPB adsorbed on the
NC surface. Increasing the modification reaction temperature decreases
the viscosity of the surfactant;45 consequently,
it increases its mobility and enables better contact with the active
sites on the surface of clay. Also, the CEC of clay increases at higher
temperature by releasing some bound functional groups and making it
free for ionization.46 This observation
implies that the modification reaction temperature plays a key role
in CAPB adsorption on the NC surface. Also, it indicates that the
CAPB adsorption on the surface of NC is an endothermic process. Hence,
a modification reaction temperature of 60 °C was chosen as the
optimal. Figure 6c
discloses that the time of modification reaction has insignificant
effect on the removal of the RY160 dye. This indicates that the adsorption
of CAPB on the NC surface is likely a quick process. Therefore, a
time for the modification reaction of 3 h was considered as the optimum.

For Pb2+, it can be observed from Figure 6b,d,f that the studied different modification
conditions do not affect the R % of Pb2+. This is due to the fact that the CAPB modification has no effect
on the CEC of the clay as stated above. Overall, the sample CAPB-NC2-60-3 was chosen as the optimum and will be
used in the following studies.

Comparing the Adsorption
Efficiency of NC and Optimal CAPB-NC
Figure 7a shows
that NC was inefficient to adsorb the RY160 dye and the adsorbed amount
was very less (2 mg/g). Modifying NC by CAPB induced a great enhancement
in the adsorption efficiency, and the adsorbed amount became 12 mg/g
for CAPB-NC2-60-3. Correlating this observation
to the results of textural analysis suggests that the inserted functional
groups on the surface of the clay as a result of CAPB modification
play a key role in the adsorption of RY160 not the SBET. This result highlights the importance of CAPB modification
and indicates that it is a key factor in the RY160 adsorption. This
trend is consistent with the previous literature.43 On the other hand, Figure 7b shows that both NC and CAPB-NC2-60-3 can efficiently adsorb Pb2+. The adsorbed amount of Pb2+ by CAPB-NC2-60-3 (40 mg/g) was
comparable to that of NC (43 mg/g). This comparable efficiency in
spite of the lower SBET of CAPB-NC indicates
that the adsorption of Pb2+ depends mainly on the CEC rather
than on the SBET. Ma et al. reported that
modifying clay with the zwitterionic surfactant had little, if any,
effect on their CEC.23 Similar behavior
has been reported before.23 It is noteworthy
that the adsorption of Pb2+ on NC was faster than that
on CAPB-NC2-60-3. NC reached equilibrium
within 30 min and achieved about the same amount of Pb2+ adsorbed on CAPB-NC2-60-3 after 60 min.
It seems that the steric effect of CAPB long alkyl chains hinders
the interaction between Pb2+ and the surface of CAPB-NC2-60-3 and slows down the adsorption process.33,47 Based on these results, the study of the effects of adsorptive solution
chemistry on the adsorption process was performed using the sample
CAPB-NC2-60-3 for RY160 dye and the NC for
Pb2+.

Figure 7 Comparison of the efficiency of NC (square) and CAPB-NC2-60-3 (circle) for the adsorption of (a) RY160
(dosage 2.5 g/L, Ci 20 mg/L, pHi 2) and (b) Pb2+ (dosage 0.5 g/L, Ci 20 mg/L,
pHi 6.2).

Effects of Adsorptive Solution
Chemistry on the Adsorption Process
The adsorption time profile
of RY160 on CAPB-NC2-60-3 and Pb2+ on NC as a function of material dosage is illustrated
in Figure 8a,b, respectively.
It is evidently perceived that the R % of RY160 and
Pb2+ increased with increasing adsorbent dosage up to 1.5
g/L (87%) and 1.0 g/L (96%), respectively, and then it remained constant.
Intuitively, increasing the adsorbent dosage ensures an increase in
the adsorption sites, subsequently increasing the R %. However, the adsorbent particles agglomerate when high dosage
is used. This agglomeration hides some adsorption sites, decreases
the surface area available for adsorption, increases the diffusional
path length, and ultimately causes a decrease in the adsorption amount.15,48,49 Accordingly, the optimum dosage
was 1.5 g/L for RY160 adsorption on CAPB-NC2-60-3 and 1.0 g/L for Pb2+ adsorption on NC.

Figure 8 Effect of experimental
conditions on the adsorption characteristics.
Dosage effect (a) RY160 (CAPB-NC2-60-3, Ci 20 mg/L, pHi 2) and (b) Pb2+ (NC, Ci 20 mg/L, pHi 6.2) and adsorptive solution initial pH (c) RY160 (CAPB-NC2-60-3, Ci 20 mg/L, dosage 1.5 g/L) and (d)
Pb2+ (NC, Ci 20 mg/L, dosage
1 g/L).

The initial pH (pHi) of the adsorptive solution is a
decisive factor in the adsorption process because it controls the
extent of adsorption by controlling the surface charge of the adsorbent
and the ionization of the adsorptive.20,39,50

Figure 8c,d depicts
the effect of pHi on the R % of RY160
and Pb2+ with time. It is evident that the amount of RY160
and Pb2+ removed depends on the solution pHi. A steeper decrease in R % can be observed upon
raising the pHi of the RY160 solution from 2 (87%) to ≥5
(43%) (Figure 7c).
The sulfonate groups of RY160 are very weak bases and stable anions
in aqueous solutions. On the other hand, at pHi 2, the
functional groups on the surface of CAPB-NC2-60-3 become protonated and acquire net positive charges. The electrostatic
interactions between the sulfonate groups of RY160 and the positively
charged surface functional groups of CAPB-NC2-60-3 drive the adsorption process and result in high R %. Raising the pHi to ≥5 reduces the protonation
of the functional groups on the surface of CAPB-NC2-60-3; consequently, repulsion between the anionic RY160 and the surface
functional groups of CAPB-NC2-60-3 takes
place and leads to a sharp reduction in R %. This
result agrees with the previously published literature.51

In contrast, a steeper increase in R % can be
observed upon raising the pHi of the Pb2+ solution
from 2 (8%) to 4 (75%) and then to 6.2 (96%) (Figure 8d). At pHi 2, the hydronium ions
exist in the solution and compete with Pb2+ for the adsorption
sites on NC, so R % tremendously decreases. Raising
the pHi to 4 or 6.2 decreases or diminishes, respectively,
the presence of hydronium ions; hence, the adsorption sites on NC
become available for Pb2+ and R % increases.
Above pHi 6.5, Pb2+ would precipitate.49,52 Similar findings have been reported earlier.11,49,52 Further experiments were performed at pHi 2 for RY160 and 6.2 for Pb2+.

Effect of
Contact Time and Kinetic Study
The effect
of contact time on RY160 and Pb2+ adsorption is shown in Figure 9. The adsorption
of RY160 is fairly rapid and reaches equilibrium within 20 min (Figure 9a). This fast adsorption
indicates strong adsorption interaction between CAPB-NC2-60-3 and RY160. On the other hand, Figure 9b shows that the adsorption of Pb2+ is a
gradual process that occurs via three stages: a fast adsorption in
the initial period up to 5 min, followed by slower adsorption up to
45 min and finally reaches equilibrium within 60 min.

Figure 9 Variation of the amount
adsorbed of (a) RY160 (CAPB-NC2-60-3, Ci 20 mg/L, dosage 1.5 g/L, pHi 2)
and (b) Pb2+ (NC, Ci 20 mg/L,
dosage 1 g/L, pHi 6.2) as a function of contact
time along with the nonlinear pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order
(PSO) model fit.

The kinetic data were
analyzed by the PFO and PSO models. The fitting
parameters are listed in Table 1. For both adsorptives, the R2 values indicate that both PFO and PSO fit well the kinetic data,
but the values of χ2 and SSE indicate PSO as the best model
that can accurately describe the kinetic data. Therefore, the assumption
of the chemisorptive nature of adsorption is valid for RY160/CAPB-NC2-60-3 and Pb2+/NC adsorption systems.

Isotherm Study and Adsorption Capacity
The adsorption
isotherms of RY160 by CAPB-NC2-60-3 and Pb2+ by NC along with the fitted models are presented in Figure 10, and the calculated
isotherm parameters are summarized in Table 2. The adsorption isotherm of both RY160/CAPB-NC2-60-3 and Pb2+/NC rises very fast
over the whole adsorptive concentration range. This suggests a strong
affinity between the adsorptives and the adsorbents. Comparing the
values of R2, χ2, and
SSE in Table 2, it
can be concluded that among the different investigated isotherm models,
the Freundlich model gives the best fit to RY160 adsorption on CAPB-NC2-60-3. Therefore, the assumption of multilayer
adsorption and heterogeneous distribution of active sites is valid
for RY160/CAPB-NC2-60-3. The value of 1/n is <1, indicating that the adsorption is a favorable
and physical process.50 This situation
is analogous to the adsorption behavior on other organically modified
clays.53 It is worth pointing out that
the suggestion of physical adsorption conflicts with that of chemical
adsorption from fitting to PSO kinetics model. However, it has been
reported that both physisorption and chemisorption can occur simultaneously.
In this case, a layer of molecules is physically adsorbed above the
chemisorbed layer.54

On the other hand, the adsorption process of Pb2+ on
NC was better fitted by the R–P model according to the values
of R2, χ2, and SSE. The
R–P model consolidates the characteristics of both Langmuir
and Freundlich isotherms and overcomes their inaccuracy in some adsorption
systems.55,56 The R–P equation is reduced to Langmuir
when the value of the exponent g is close to 1 and
to Henry’s law when g is close to 0. The value
of g calculated in this study (Table 2) is close to 1, indicating that the R–P
equation can be reduced to Langmuir. This finding is in line with
the high R2 and the low χ2 and SSE calculated from the fitting of the Langmuir model. In other
words, the Langmuir model can satisfactorily describe the adsorption
of Pb2+ on NC. The good fitting to the Langmuir model indicates
that Pb2+ binds to homogeneous active sites in the form
of monolayers on the surface of NC. The separation factor (RL) is usually used to show if the adsorption
process is unfavorable (RL > 1), linear
(RL = 1), favorable (0 < RL> 1), or irreversible (RL = 0). The value of RL in Table 2 implies that the adsorption
of Pb2+ on NC is favorable. The calculated Langmuir theoretical
monolayer saturation capacity for Pb2+ adsorption on NC
was compared to other clay-based adsorbents reported in the literature. Table 3 clearly shows that
the NC used in this study has superior adsorption capacity relative
to other clay-based adsorbents; consequently, it could be applied
as an excellent adsorbent for removing Pb2+ from contaminated
water.

Conclusions
In this work, efforts were made to utilize
and enhance the adsorption
properties of copious low-cost NC. The physical, chemical, and adsorption
properties of the NC were assessed before and after modification with
the zwitterionic surfactant CAPB. Modification was a key factor in
RY 160 adsorption and was ineffectual in Pb2+ adsorption.
The sample that was heated at 60 °C for 3 h with a concentration
of CAPB equal to 2 CEC of NC achieved the highest removal of RY160.
The adsorption interaction between RY160 and CAPB-NC was strong and
favored at pHi 2 and resulted in the formation of multilayers.
On the other hand, Pb2+ adsorption on NC occurred via monolayer
formation and was favored at pHi 6.2. To sum up, NC and
CAPB-NC can efficiently remove Pb2+ and RY160, respectively,
from the aqueous medium.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The
RY160 dye was provided by a local textile
plant. Commercial CAPB was purchased from Mystic Moments and used
as received. Table S1 shows some properties
of the RY160 dye and CAPB. Analytical grade Pb(NO3)2, NaOH, and HCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Egypt)
and used for the preparation of Pb2+ stock and working
solutions, and solution pHi adjustment. Deionized (DI)
water was used during the whole study. The NC was collected from Wadi
Kadid, Khulais governorate, Saudi Arabia. The clay was ground using
ball milling, sieved using a 0.45 μm mesh, washed with DI water,
and dried at 105 °C overnight. The NC sample was denoted as NC.

Determination of the NC CEC
CEC was determined by saturating
the cation exchange sites of the NC with ammonium acetate, followed
by measuring the concentration of exchangeable cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions) released
from the NC.65 Specifically, 0.2 g of the
NC was shaken in 100 mL of 1.0 mol/L ammonium acetate for 120 min,
and then the concentration of exchangeable cations was measured by
inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES)
(Agilent 5100, USA) following the American Public Health Association
(APHA) methods.66

Preparation of the Zwitterionic
Surfactant-Modified Clay
The NC (10 g) was dispersed in DI
water (200 mL) by vigorous shaking.
An initial amount of CAPB equivalent to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 times
of the NC CEC was added slowly to the suspension at constant temperature
(25, 40, 60, or 80 °C) and vigorous shaking. The shaking was
continued for 3, 6, 12, or 24 h, and then the mixture was left to
equilibrate for 12 h at room temperature. Afterward, CAPB-NC was collected
by centrifugation, washed several times with DI water, air-dried at
70 °C, and ground. The samples were denoted as CAPB-NCa-b-c where the subscripts a, b, and c indicate the CEC multiplier, the reaction temperature,
and the reaction time, respectively.

Characterization of NC
and CAPB-NC
The XRD analyses
of NC and CAPB-NC were performed using a PANalytical X’Pert
Pro diffractometer (The Netherlands) with Cu Kα source (λ
= 1.5406 Å). The collected XRD pattern was compared with standard
ASTM cards to identify the crystallized phases. Quantitative phase
analysis of the NC was performed using DIFFRAC.EVA V4 software. TGA
was performed using a Shimadzu TG-50H thermal analyzer. A known weight
of the samples was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at
a rate of 10 °C/min under the high-purity N2 atmosphere.
FTIR was used to identify the surface functional groups of NC and
CAPB-NC. The FTIR spectra of the samples were collected using a Jasco
FT/IR-6100A instrument. KBr disks were prepared by pressing a mixture
of powdered sample and KBr. All spectra were recorded at room temperature
over the range of 4000–400 cm–1. The morphologies
of NC and CAPB-NC were observed by a field emission scanning electron
microscope (JEOL 6400 F, USA); the accelerating voltage and working
distance were 5 kV and 20 mm, respectively. Prior to SEM observation,
a small amount of the material was fixed on conductive carbon tape,
mounted on the support, and sputtered with gold. Textural analysis
was performed using nitrogen adsorption at 77 K by a BELSORP-max (BEL
Japan Inc). Before analysis, the samples were degassed for 24 h at
150 °C under a helium flow. The specific surface area and the
pore size distribution were obtained by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method (SBET) and the nonlocal density
functional theory (NLDFT) method, respectively.

Adsorption
Studies
The adsorption experiments were
performed in a single component batch mode system. A precisely weighed
amount of NC or CAPB-NC was shaken with 100 mL of adsorptive (RY160
dye or Pb2+) solution using a shaking water bath (MaXturdy18,
DAIHAN Scientific Co, Korea) at 26 °C and 120 rpm. At preset
times, aliquots were withdrawn and filtered, and the residual concentrations
of adsorptives were determined. The RY160 dye was quantified by a
UV–vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V630, Japan) at λ = 425
nm using a standard calibration curve. Figures S1 and S2 show the UV–visible spectrum and standard
calibration curve of the RY160 dye, respectively. While Pb2+ was quantified using ICP–OES (Agilent 5100, USA) following
the APHA methods.66 The adsorption process
was optimized in terms of material dosage, adsorptive solution initial
pH (pHi), contact time, and adsorptive initial concentration
(Ci). The exact experimental conditions
are given in the figure captions. The amount of adsorptive removed
(R, %) and weight retained by the material at time t (qt, mg/g)
were calculated by eqs 1 and 2, respectively. 1   2  where Ct (mg/L) is the concentration of the
adsorptive at time t, V (L) is the
volume of the adsorptive
solution, and w (g) is the weight of the material.

The adsorption kinetic data were analyzed by the nonlinear forms
of the PFO and PSO equations, while the equilibrium data were analyzed
by the nonlinear forms of two-parameter (Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin–Radushkevich,
Temkin) and three-parameter [Redlich–Peterson (R–P)]
models. Table S2 lists the equations and
the parameter definition of the used models. The nonlinear regression,
chi-square (χ2) test, sum of squared errors (SSEs),
and the kinetic and equilibrium isotherm model constants were calculated
using the OriginPro 2016 Ver. 9.3.226 software program. The best model
that fits the experimental data was identified based on the values
of χ2, SSE, and coefficient of determination (R2). The model that gives the highest R2 value and the lowest χ2 and SSE value
is the one that best describes the adsorption data.
