High-molecular-weight poly(propylene
carbonate) (PPC) [number-average
molecular mass (Mn): 80 000–100 000]
is readily alcoholized into PPC macrodiols in the presence of 1,2-propanediol
(PDO), 1,4-butanediol (BDO), or 1,6-hexanediol (HDO). The high-molecular-weight
PPC and small amount of diols, such as PDO, BDO, or HDO, were stirred
at elevated temperatures to convert the extremely viscous high-molecular-weight
polymer to low-molecular-weight macrodiols with gel permeation chromatography-measured Mn of about 3000 Da. The chopping reaction of
the high-molecular-weight PPC was studied in detail, such as the influences
of the catalyst residue, the kinds of alcoholysis agents, reaction
temperature, and time. The reaction mechanism of alcoholysis is proposed
according to the experimental results. The results indicate that the
presence of a trace residue of zinc catalyst (Zn-G-III) in PPC, excess
diol feeding, and higher temperature can accelerate the alcoholysis.
Moreover, different diols can produce different PPC macrodiols with
varying end-capping. Finally, polycarbonate ether urethane can be
successfully synthesized using as-synthesized PPC macrodiols and poly(propylene
glycol) (Mn ≈ 3000) as the soft
segment and 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate or BDO as the
hard segment. The full evaluation for the synthesized PPC macrodiols
demonstrates their potential applications in the polyurethane industry.

Introduction
Owing to their good
mechanical properties, polyurethanes are widely
used as therapeutic materials. Oligoethers and oligoesters are typically
used as the soft segments in the preparation of polyurethanes to acquire
the desired elasticity and good biological affinities. Typical polyurethanes
based on oligoethers undergo autoxidation, metal ion oxidation, and
environmental stress cracking and have poor strength. However, the
polyurethanes prepared from aliphatic polycarbonate diols (PCDLs)
have superior strength and hardness, together with a better in vitro,
in vivo, and chemical stability when compared with poly(ether urethane).1−3 In this connection, poly(carbonate urethane)s (PCUs) are often used
in long-term and high mechanical strength applications.

For
the polyurethanes containing a carbonate moiety, there are
many innovative studies for preparing new polyurethanes with superior
properties. With new functional properties,4−7 the polyurethanes containing a
carbonate moiety can be found in many advanced applications. Moreover,
because of environmental concerns, the synthesis of sustainable and
environmentally friendly polyurethanes has attracted increasing attention.
In this connection, an alternative approach to synthesize environmentally
friendly polyurethanes is to switch from petro-based ones to bio-based
polyhydroxyurethanes,8 most of which are
synthesized from bio-based polyols like vegetable oil.9 However, the synthesized polyols are still ester-type ones
rather than carbonate-type ones.

The most typical preparation
method of PCDLs is the polycondensation
of phosgene and aliphatic diol, which has been eliminated because
of the toxicity of the phosgene. So far, many investigations on the
preparation of PCDLs using immortal copolymerization have been reported.
For example, Gao and his co-workers have synthesized the PCDLs with
tunable carbonate by immortal copolymerization of CO2/propylene
oxide (PO) in the presence of sebacic acid (SA) as the chain transfer
agent and zinc–cobalt double metal cyanide complex (Zn–Co–DMCC)
as the catalyst.10 The synthesis of PCDLs
is also disclosed via polycondensation of diethyl carbonate with an
aliphatic diol.11 Meanwhile, ring-opening
polymerization has been used to synthesize PCDLs as well.12 Nevertheless, many of these methods will suffer
the problem of high polyether (PE) segment content.10

As mentioned above, PCDLs can be synthesized through
various routes.
However, most of the concerns focus on developing new highly active
and selective catalysts with well-defined structure for preparing
PCDLs “from bottom to top”, whereas much less attention
has been paid for the synthesis of PCDLs “from top to bottom”,
even though lots of preparation methods of the high-molecular-weight
aliphatic polycarbonates have been reported and even commercialized.13−15

Poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) is a carbon dioxide-based
polymer,
which is the copolymerization of CO2 and PO in the presence
of Zn-G-III as the catalyst. Being well-known, CO2 is a
low-cost, renewable, and sustainable feedstock. PPC derived from CO2 is an innocuous and biodegradable material. Using PPC as
the feedstock to synthesize polyols has the advantages of being innocuous
and sustainable. For the past 15 years, our research group has already
developed the entire industrial technology to produce high-molecular-weight
PPC in a capacity of 25 000 t/a in Tianguan Enterprise Group
Company (Nanyang City of Henan Province, China). Zn-G-III is kind
of support zinc glutarates catalyst for the industrial copolymerization
of carbon dioxide and PO. High-molecular-weight PPC has already been
commercialized in Tianguan Enterprise Group Co. Ltd. Its well-defined
structure has been reported in the previous literature.16 Because of the very high catalytic activity
and structural selectivity, this industrial synthetic method can produce
high-molecular-weight PPC with superior comprehensive properties.14,16,17 However, there is an increasing
need for aliphatic carbonate macrodiols for various applications.
This drives researchers to develop simple and low-cost methodology
to produce the said macrodiols.

Herewith, in this article, we
report a method to prepare PPC macrodiols
by the alcoholysis of high-molecular-weight PPC in the presence of
small molecular diols. The side reaction mechanism and influence factors
of alcoholysis are summarized, proposed, and discussed accordingly.
Moreover, the possible catalytic mechanisms and the end-capping mechanisms
are also suggested. Consequently, the PPC macrodiols were used to
synthesize a series of PPC-based polyurethane, followed by the investigation
of its mechanical properties. This article provides a new methodology
to synthesize the PPC oligomer. Compared with the traditional ways
of producing PPC oligomer, this method does not need a high pressure
reaction process. This is the first report that successfully synthesizes
the PPC oligomer in bulk with a high carbonate content.

Results and Discussion
Alcoholytic
Chopping of High-Molecular-Weight PPC
PCU,
possessing good biocompatibility and mechanical properties, is known
as a new kind of biomaterial used in the long-term implantation devices.18 In this connection, the synthesis of carbonate
macrodiols from a polycarbonate falls into an interesting topic. Being
well-known, many kinds of polyesters, such as polycaprolactone and
polylactide, can undergo transesterification reaction with or without
the presence of a catalyst, resulting in low-molecular-weight oligomers.
However, the alcoholysis of high-molecular-weight polycarbonate has
rarely been reported.

Commercially available PPC with a very
high molecular weight of 82 kDa (Figure 1a) was chopped using 1,2-propylene glycol
as an alcoholysis reagent at 180 °C. Liquid 1,2-propanediol (PDO)
can also serve as a rheological additive to accelerate the reaction
rate of alcoholysis of PPC and to decrease the reaction temperature.
The viscosity of the reaction system decreased gradually owing to
the decrease in molecular weight of the resulting macrodiols. Finally,
viscous, turbid liquid was obtained. After removing the trace amount
of byproduct, a colorless and a transparent waxy solid (Figure 1b) was afforded upon being
washed with 5% HCl and deionized water.

Figure 1 Photographs of (a) commercial
PPC, (b) PPC macrodiols, and (c)
synthesized polycarbonate ether urethane (PCEU).

The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)
and the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technologies were adopted to investigate
the composition of the alcoholysate and predict the reactions occurred.
The 1H NMR spectrum of alcoholysate is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen
that the peaks at δ 1.3, 4.2, and 5.0 are assigned to CH3, CH2, and CH, respectively, in turn in the PPC
chain, whereas the weak signals at δ 3.4–3.7 and δ
1.2 are ascribed to CH (and CH2) and CH3 in
small amounts of PE segments. The peaks at δ 1.50, 4.55 (and
4.0), and 4.85 correspond to CH3, CH2, and CH
of propylene carbonate (PC), respectively, and the CH3,
CH2, and CH of 1,2-propylene glycol signals are separately
observed at δ 1.15, 3.40 (and 3.60), and 3.90, respectively.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectrum of alcoholysate obtained using PDO as
an alcoholysis reagent (entry 2).

According to the above 1H NMR assignment, the
alcoholysate
contains not only PPC macrodiols and unreacted PDO but also PE segments
and PC byproducts. The formation of PC byproducts and PE segments
results from the occurrence of unzipping and decarboxylation reaction,
respectively, during the alcoholysis process. There is no evidence
for the occurrence of a random chain-scission reaction because no
signal of C=CH2 group is observed in 1H NMR spectrum.

As shown in Figure S1, there are almost
no unsaturated segments of C=C signal at 1640 cm–1 were observed, demonstrating no occurrence of random chain-scission,
which leads to the formation of vinyl end-ground. Consequently, the
random chain-scission contributes little to the decrease in the molecular
weight of PPC.

Factors Influencing the Alcoholysis
First, commercial
PPC contains about 2 wt % residual catalyst, which has an obvious
effect on the alcoholysis of PPC. However, the catalyst concentration
can be readily controlled by washing with 5% HCl. The alcoholysis
results of PPCs with different residual catalyst concentrations are
listed at entry 2–4 in Table 1. It is interesting to note that the alcoholysis rate
decreases with the decrease in the content of the catalyst in PPC,
suggesting that the zinc catalyst also acts as a catalyst for the
alcoholysis reaction. Consequently, the catalyst residue favors the
alcoholysis of PPC in the presence of small molecular diols.

Second, the molecular
weight of PPC macrodiols is a critical factor
in the synthesis of PCU. In this connection, the feeding amount of
alcoholysis agent, reaction temperature, and time was changed to investigate
their effect on the molecular weight of PPC macrodiols. The experimental
results are summarized in Table 1; from the results of entry 2, 5, and 6, it can be
seen that the alcoholysis rate increases obviously with the increase
in the feeding amount of PDO. It took only 30 min to obtain PPC macrodiols
with an Mn of about 3 kDa in the case
when 30 mmol diol was charged. Compared with entry 5, 7, and 8, it
is apparent that higher reaction temperature can decrease the reaction
time to obtain PPC macrodiols with low Mn, indicating that the alcoholysis reaction follows the time–temperature
equivalence principle. This means that we can design and afford any
molecular weight PPC by simply adjusting the reaction temperature
and time.

Besides the molecular weight, the composition of the
resulted PPC
macrodiols can greatly affect the practical application in the synthesis
of polyurethane. Therefore, the PPC, PE unit, and PC contents of the
alcoholysate can be calculated from 1H NMR results and
are listed in Table 2. Three component contents can be calculated from the following equations 1   2   3  where the letter “A”
refers to the integral area of the signal, the subscript
nearby showing the corresponding signal location.

For entry 2 with 1,2-propylene
glycol as the alcoholysis agent,
the alcoholysate contains 58.1% PPC segment, 9.1% PE segment, and
32.8% PC byproduct subjected to the alcoholysis at 180 °C for
60 min. The existence of relatively large amount of PC indicates that
the unzipping reaction dominates the side reaction during alcoholysis.

To increase the yield of PPC macrodiols, 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and
1,6-hexanediol (HDO) were further used as the alcoholysis reagent. Table 2 presents the comparison
among PDO, BDO, and HDO as alcoholysis reagents. From this table,
it can be seen that both BDO and HDO can obviously increase the selectivity
of the formation of PPC macrodiols. The content of the PC byproduct
decreases from 32.8 to 19.4% (entry 9) and 17.2% (entry 10). Nevertheless,
it should be mentioned that the formation of PC byproduct cannot be
completely avoided (see Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Possible Side Reaction
during the Alcoholysis
Proposed Mechanism of the Alcoholysis
In previous works,17,19,20 it has been well-documented that
PPC exhibits a relatively poor thermal stability. The thermal decomposition
may occur at temperatures higher than 180 °C. This phenomenon
can be observed as the molecular weight decreases in the absence of
the alcoholysis agent (entry 1 in Table 1). For the thermal decomposition mechanism
of PPC, several proposals have been reported elsewhere in the literature.
It has been reported that, at a relatively high temperature, unzipping
reaction and random chain-scission occur in PPC polymer chain. In
the unzipping reaction, the hydroxyl end group backbites and reacts with the nearest carbonyl carbon atom in the PPC backbone,
leading to the formation of a 5-member ring compound, that is, PC.17,20 Compared with the unzipping reaction, random chain-scission reaction
needs higher energy to induce the cleavage C–O bond leading
to the formation of CO2 and two PPC chains with lower molecular
weight.21 The occurrence of unzipping PPC
can explain the existence of PC in alcoholysate (entry 2 in Table 2). It should be noted
that other poly(aliphatic carbonate) also suffer the same thermal
degradation.22 In this work, Li et al.
reported that during the decomposition of poly(butylene carbonate)
(PBC), the decarboxylation reaction occurs and yields the PE segment
that was found in the alcoholysate (entry 2 in Table 2).22 These proposals
are summarized into three mechanisms as shown in Scheme 2, that is, unzipping, random
chain scission, and decarboxylation.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Scheme
of PCEU
In conclusion, the
PC byproducts and the PE segments of the alcoholysate
result mainly from its unzipping and decarboxylation, which do not
contribute to the decrease in the molecular weight of PPC. The main
contribution to the decrease in the molecular weight of PPC lies on
the alcoholysis or random chain scission. From the results of 1H NMR (Figure 2) and FTIR (Figure S1) techniques, the
absence of C=C signal demonstrates that the alcoholysis is
the predominant reaction to yield PPC macrodiols.

As discussed
above, the catalyst residue favors the alcoholysis
of PPC in the presence of diols. It is apparent that the catalyst
residue acts as the catalyst of alcoholysis as well. Presumably, carbonyl
oxygen coordinates with the zinc catalyst and withdraws the electron
on the carbonyl carbon. The hydroxyl oxygen of PDO then attacks the
carbonyl carbon and forms a tetrahedron transient state, resulting
in the chopping of PPC chains. In this mechanism, BDO inserts into
the PPC polymer chain and terminated it with hydroxyl, resulting in the formation
of PBC segments as verified by the existence of PBC segment in PPC
macrodiols in both 1H NMR (chemical shift δ 4.2 and
δ 1.77) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time
of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrum (Figure 3). Moreover, this proposed mechanism is analogous to
the alcoholysis of PBC catalyzed by alkoxide reported by Lee’s
group.23

Figure 3 MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of PPC macrodiols
(entry 9). A = −[OCH2CH(CH3)OCO]–;
B = −[OCH2CH(CH3)]–; and C = −[OCH2CH2CH2CH2]–.

It has been disclosed in the previous
paper20 that the unzipping degradation
is because of the backbiting
of the terminal hydroxyl groups at the carbonyl carbon of the adjoined
PC segments to form thermodynamic stable cyclic carbonate with a five-membered
ring. In case that the adjacent position to the terminal hydroxyl
is propylene ether segments, or other structural segments that are
difficult to form the cyclic compound, then the repeating PC release
can be stopped. When using PDO as an alcoholysis reagent to attack
the carbonyl carbon and chop the long polymer chain, two more terminal
hydroxyl groups with adjoining PC segments will be formed leading
to an autoacceleration of the unzipping process.

Unlike PDO
that yields two extra PPC ends for each polymer chain
chopping, the alcoholysis using BDO (or HDO) produces one PBC or [polyhexylene
carbonate (PHC)] chain end. As the corresponding backbite product,
butylene carbonate (or hexylene carbonate) is thermodynamically unstable
and PBC or PHC chain end is rather difficult to suffer the unzipping
reaction. In a word, PBC and PHC play the role of end-capping the
PPC polymer. The end-capped PPC shows high resistance to the unzipping
reaction as reported by Dixon et al.24 In
this sense, the unzipping reaction can be effectively eliminated to
an extremely low content (the yield of PC was reduced to about 19.4
and 17.2% for using BDO and HDO as an alcoholysis reagent compared
with 32.8% while using PDO). However, it should be emphasized that
the formation of PC cannot be completely avoided. The reason is that
the formed new PPC end groups cannot be completely eliminated, even
though longer chain diols are used as an alcoholysis reagent.

Chemical
Structure of PPC Macrodiols
Figure 3 shows the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum
of PPC macrodiols obtained using BDO as the alcoholysis reagent (entry
9). Similar to common polymers, the molecular weight distribution
of the synthesized PPC macrodiols also exhibits a Gaussian model.
However, the PPC macrodiols possess diversity because of the varying
structural segments of the alcoholysate. As shown in Figure 3, there are more than seven
kinds of structures in the PPC macrodiols, implying its very complicated
structure. From these macrodiols, it can be observed that there are
pretty little ether units because of their low content in original
PPC. When BDO was used as the alcoholysis reagent, BDO units can then
be found in the resulted PPC macrodiols backbone (Figure 3). This shows the evidence
that BDO was inserted into the PPC macrodiols backbone and did take
part in the alcoholysis. Most macrodiols contain one or two BDO units,
suggesting that BDO functions as an end-capping agent and can effectively
inhibit the thermally unzipping degradation. Conclusively, the as-prepared
PPC macrodiols show a relatively wide molecular dispersity and complicated
composition.

Synthesis of PCEU
For ease of comparison,
both PCEU
and PE urethane were synthesized. The appearance of the products is
shown in Figure 1c. Figure 4 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of the synthesized PCEU. The peaks at δ 3.75,
7.0 (b, and 7.3b), and 9.5 are assigned to CH2 between
the benzene rings, CH on the benzene ring, and the NH on the urethane
bond, in their turns. While the signals at δ 4.0 and δ
1.68 are ascribed to BDO linkages as another part of the hard segment,
the peaks at δ 1.2, 4.1, and 4.88 correspond to CH3, CH2, and CH of the PPC soft segment, respectively, when
using DMSO-d6 as the solvent, in which
the chemical shifts of each peak are slightly different when using
chloroform as the solvent. For PE soft segment, the chemical shifts
of CH3 and CH2 (and CH) of the PE segment are
observed at δ 1.1 and δ 3.4, respectively. The disappearance
of the signal ascribed to 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate
(MDI) implies the successful synthesis of PCEU.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectrum
of the synthesized PCEU(40% PPC/PPG).

From the integral area in 1H NMR, the
composition ratio
of the synthesized PU can be calculated. The content of the carbonate
unit in the soft segment and the total hard segment in the synthesized
PCEU can be calculated by the following formula and are summarized
in Table 3. 4   5  

Table 3 Composition of the Synthesized PCEU
and PU(PPG)

PCEU(80% PPC/PPG)	80 (88)	30	79.94	30.67	92.15	
a Calculated from 1H NMR
according to eqs 4 and 5.

It should
be pointed out that both the carbonate content in the
soft segment and the content of the hard segment of resulting PCEU
are very close to the feeding ratio. For example, in PCEU(80% PPC/PPG), the feeding ratio of carbonate (in soft segment) and the hard segment
(MDI) are 80% and 30 wt %, respectively, whereas the calculated ratio
is 79.94% and 30.67 wt %, demonstrating that the synthesized PPC macrodiols
exhibit similar reactivity as the ether diols during the polyurethane
synthesis.

Mechanical Properties and Hardness of PCEU
The mechanical
performance and hardness (Shore A) of PCEU and PU are shown in the Table 4. The PU synthesized
from poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) is named PU(PPG), whereas
the one from the mixture of PPG and PPC is called PCEU(80% PPC/PPG); the number following the “PPC” indicates the mole
percent of the carbonate unit in the soft segment.

a Molecular weight

Because of the low glass transition temperature of
PPG, PU(PPG) behaves in a very soft nature with a Shore
A hardness
of 31. Similarly, tensile strength (σb) of PU(PPG) is lower than 2 MPa with an elongation at break (εb) of greater than 88%. In case that 40% carbonate was inserted
into the soft segment, Shore A hardness of PCEU(40% PPC/PPG) increases dramatically from 31 to 81. Meanwhile, the tensile strength
and elongation at break increase to 29.81 MPa and 1198%, respectively.
With a further increase in the carbonate content, Shore A hardness
of PCEU(80% PPC/PPG) slightly increases to 88 as shown
in Figure 5. On the
other hand, the tensile strength at 100 and 300% elongation increase
with an increase in the carbonate content. For example, the tensile
strength of PCEU(80% PPC/PPG) at 300% elongation increases
to 29.85 MPa. The strain–stress curve versus the carbonate
contents is presented in Figure 6.

Figure 5 Hardness of PCEU and PU(PPG).

Figure 6 Tensile strength and elongation at the break of PCEU and
PU(PPG).

In this study, five types
of polyurethanes with varying contents
of PPC moiety were synthesized under the same reaction conditions.
As shown in Table 4, although
the molecular weights and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polyurethanes
are different, it can be easily seen that the contributions of the
polycarbonate content and molecular weights to mechanical properties.
For example, comparing the samples with similar molecular weight (PCEU(40% PPC/PPG), PCEU(60% PPC/PPG), and
PCEU(80% PPC/PPG)), it is apparent that the mechanical
strength increases with the increase in the content of the PPC moiety.
The increase in the carbonate content can increase both tensile strength
and hardness of the synthesized PCEU because of both rigidity of carbonate
moiety and the hydrogen-bond formation between carbonate groups with
urethane. In conclusion, the performance of synthesized PCEU can be
readily tailored by simply adjusting the ratio of the carbonate group
content to the PPG content.

Conclusions
An
effective method to prepare low-molecular-weight PPC macrodiols
by alcoholysis of high-molecular-weight PPC has been successfully
developed. The residual zinc catalyst in commercial PPC was confirmed
to be also a catalyst for the alcoholysis reaction. The PPC macrodiols
with desirable molecular weight can be readily synthesized by controlling
the amount of alcoholysis agent, reaction temperature, and time. Thermal
decarboxylation and unzipping reaction were observed during the alcoholysis
reaction, but it can be eliminated to very limited content. When using
BDO and HDO as alcoholysis agents, the formation of cyclic carbonate
“byproduct” can be greatly decreased owing to the formation
of PPC macrodiols with BDO or HDO end-capped groups. The as-synthesized
PPC macrodiols can be used as a diol to synthesize PCU or PCEU. The
performance of the synthesized PCEU can be readily tailored by simply
adjusting the ratio of the carbonate group content to the PPG content.
Moreover, PPC macrodiol is a special polyol with its biodegradability;
this character can produce a biodegradable polyurethane. In conclusion,
the PPC macrodiols synthesized by alcoholysis show a bright future
in the potential applications of the polyurethane industry.

from Jining Baiyi Co. Ltd.

Preparation of Macrodiol
A typical
process for the
preparation of PPC macrodiols is as follows: PDO (0.57 g 7.5 mmol)
and high-molecular-weight PPC (5.1 g 50 mmol) were added to a three-necked
flask (25 mL), which was connected to a manifold equipped with vacuum
and N2 gas lines and equipped with a mechanical stirrer.
The flask was purged and vacuumed several times using nitrogen to
guarantee free of oxygen and moisture before it was immersed in a
hot-oil bath (180 °C). The chopping reaction was performed for
120 min. After cooling to room temperature under the protection of
an inert atmosphere, the resultant PPC macrodiols were washed using
5% hydrochloric acid and deionized water thrice to remove the trace
residual catalyst.

The residual zinc catalyst content in the commercial high-molecular-weight PPC can
be controlled by washing it times with 5% hydrochloric acid. High-molecular-weight
PPC was dissolved in the chloroform before washing with HCl. Vigorous
stirring was carried out for at least 5 min to afford a satisfactory
purification, followed by precipitating into ethanol and drying under
vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h.

Preparation of PCEU
In this study, PCEU was synthesized
by the traditional two-step solution polymerization. Both MDI and
BDO were used as hard segments and chain extenders, respectively,
and their total contents were set to be 30 wt %. The soft segment
was the mixture of PPC macrodiols (Mn ≈
3000 kDa, obtained from alcoholysis) and PPG (Mn ≈ 3000 kDa).

PPC macrodiols (8.38 g, OH 10.34
mmol) and PPG (5.84 g, −OH grounds 5.76 mmol) were charged
into a three-necked flask (100 mL), which was connected to a manifold
equipped with vacuum and N2 gas lines, and equipped with
a mechanical stirrer. Before MDI was added into the flask, the system
was dried for 2 h at 120 °C and 300 Pa. After the completion
of vacuum drying, N2 gas was charged into the system. When
the system temperature was cooled to 70 °C, MDI [5.00 g, −isocyanate
(NCO) grounds 40 mmol] was charged into the flask. The prepolymerization
was performed until the NCO groups decreased to the theoretical value
that can be detected by titration using dibutylamide. The calculated
amount of DMAC (51 mL), BDO (1.11 g, −OH grounds 24.67 mmol),
and stannous octoate (21 μL) were added into the flask in turn,
and the reaction temperature was increased to 75 °C. The reaction
was performed until no existence of the NCO group by FTIR confirmation
was found. Upon cooling to ambient temperature, the resulting mixture
was slowly poured into methanol. The final product was filtered and
dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. The schematic synthesis
of the PCEU is shown in Scheme 2.

Measurement
1H NMR spectra of the synthesized
PPC macrodiols were recorded on a Bruker DRX-400 NMR spectrometer
at room temperature using CDCl3 as a solvent. The Mn and PDI of the resultant PPC macrodiols were
measured using a GPC system (Waters 515 HPLC Pump, Waters 2414 detector)
with a set of three columns (Waters Styragel 500, 10 000, and
100 000 Å) and chloroform [high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) grade] as an eluant. When GPC was used to measure the Mn and PDI of PU, tetrahydrofuran (THF) (HPLC
grade) was used as an eluant. The GPC system was calibrated by a series
of polystyrene standards with polydispersities of 1.02 standards.
MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded on a Bruker ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF
spectrometer, with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix and THF
as solution.

The residual catalyst in commercial PPC was measured
using a PerkinElmer thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer
(TG/DTG) instrument against alumina as a reference. For each measurement,
10 mg of the samples were used. The experiments were performed under
dry air atmosphere at 100 mL/min flow rates. Heating rates were adopted
at 10 °C/min, from room temperature to 600 °C. Equation 1 shows the calculation formula
of the content of the catalyst (Zn-G-III) in commercial PPC 6  where m600, m350, and m30 mean
the residual mass at 600, 350, and 30 °C, respectively, while MZn-G-III and MZnO refer to the molar mass of Zn-G-III and ZnO.

The THF solution of PPC–PU and PPG–PU were casted
on the Teflon culture dish to obtain a roundness film. The dumb-bell-shaped
samples were cut from the film, with the same length and width of
25 mm and 4 mm, respectively. The stress–strain test was performed
on a temperature-controlled universal testing machine at 25 °C
with an extension rate of 50 mm/min. Shore A hardness test of PPC–PU
and PPG–PU was characterized by a Shandu sclerometer; each
sample should have a thickness over 6 mm.
