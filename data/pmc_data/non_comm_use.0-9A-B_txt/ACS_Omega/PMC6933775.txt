In this work, nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanoparticles
were synthesized by dextrin from corn-mediated sol–gel combustion
method and were annealed at 600, 800, and 1000 °C. The structural
and physical characteristics of prepared nanoparticles were studied
in detail. The average crystallite size was 20.6, 34.5, and 68.6 nm
for NiFe2O4 nanoparticles annealed at 600 °C
(NFD@600), 800 °C (NFD@800), and 1000 °C (NFD@1000), respectively.
The electromagnetic interference shielding performance of prepared
nanocomposites of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (NFD@600

(SET) for the prepared nanocomposites have been noticed
to be 45.56, 36.43, and 35.71 dB for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP,
and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposites, respectively, at the thickness
of 2 mm in microwave X-band range (8.2–12.4 GHz). The evaluated
values of specific EMI shielding effectiveness (SSE) were 38.81, 32.79,
and 31.73 dB·cm3/g, and the absolute EMI shielding
effectiveness (SSE/t) values were 388.1, 327.9, and 317.3 dB·cm2/g for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP,
respectively. The prepared lightweight and flexible sheets can be
considered useful nanocomposites against electromagnetic radiation
pollution.

1 Introduction
Recently, the continuous
development and the utilization of electronic
devices in our daily life have raised the serious issue of electromagnetic
interference pollution.1,2 It has become an extensive concern
owing to its potential influence on human health and electronic safety.3,4 Therefore, substantial attempts have been carried out to develop
high-performance electromagnetic interference shielding materials.5,6 Traditional electromagnetic shielding materials associated with
single dielectric loss or magnetic loss characteristics have provided
an unsatisfactory electromagnetic shielding performance due to the
issue of impedance mismatching.7 One of
the effective approaches to improve the performance of shielding material
is to decorate spinel ferrite nanoparticles with reduced graphene
oxide as impedance matching can be regulated with the synergistic
impact of magnetic and dielectric loss.8 An ideal electromagnetic interference shielding material should
possess strong absorption characteristics, low density, light weight,
design flexibility, thermal stability, etc.9 Therefore, preparation of nanocomposite consisting of polymer-magnetic
and dielectric inorganic material with high magnetic and dielectric
losses could be a better choice. In addition, the physical properties
of nanocomposites depend on their microstructures such as particle
size, interfaces, density, etc.10 Therefore,
the physical characteristics of nanocomposites could be improved by
the optimization of microstructure. It is of great interest to investigate
the impact of microstructure on the electromagnetic interference shielding
characteristics.11,12 Spinel ferrite nanoparticles
have received a great potential in the wide range of applications
such as information storage, electronic devices to medical diagnostics,
drug delivery, supercapacitors, anode materials for lithium-ion batteries,
and microwave- and radar-absorbing material.13,14 Nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) is one of the important
candidates among the spinel ferrite family because of its application
in microwave, electronic, magnetic, and electrochemical devices.15 It exhibits a low coercivity, eddy and hysteresis
loss; therefore, it is beneficial for electronic devices such as telecommunications
and high-frequency devices.16 It has been
also noticed that the electromagnetic wave absorption capability of
spinel ferrite nanoparticles depends on its structural characteristics
such as crystallinity, particle size, cation distribution, morphology,
dopant ions, etc.17,18 Accordingly, considerable efforts
have been devoted to prepare spinel ferrite nanoparticles by various
chemical synthesis techniques such as co-precipitation, hydrothermal/solvothermal
method, microwave-assisted synthesis, microemulsion method, sonochemical
synthesis, sol–gel combustion method, etc.19−21 Among various
chemical synthesis approaches, the sol–gel combustion method
has various advantages such as a rapid synthesis approach, formation
of high-purity product, homogeneous composition, stabilization of
metastable phases, low energy consumption, and a simple, economic,
and scalable synthesis method.22,23

Recently, polymer
nanocomposites-based advanced electromagnetic
interference shielding materials have received an interest among researchers
and academicians due to their advantages of light weight, easy preparation,
tunable conductivity, corrosion resistance, etc. in comparison to
traditional metal-based shielding material.24 Carbon material-based fillers in the polymer matrix have shown promising
electromagnetic interference shielding characteristics.25 This type of polymer composite cannot offer
effective magnetic loss effect; therefore, it has limitation in electromagnetic
waves absorption. To achieve the presence of both electric and magnetic
dipoles for excellent electromagnetic interference shielding nanocomposites,
various magnetic nanoparticles with carbon-based materials have been
used as fillers in the polymer matrix.26,27 The natural
resonance, eddy current loss, and hysteresis losses generated by NiFe2O4 spinel ferrite can provide efficient magnetic
loss in shielding material to efficiently absorb the electromagnetic
waves.28 Reduced graphene oxide exhibits
a high dielectric loss; therefore, it provides attenuation characteristics
to electromagnetic waves because of its high conductivity.29 The combination of conducting reduced graphene
oxide and spinel ferrite can provide high dielectric and magnetic
loss in the polymer matrix, which can generate efficient electromagnetic
interference shielding composite material.30 Polypropylene is one of the most common thermoplastics, and it is
chosen as the polymer matrix due to its extremely low cost and excellent
characteristics such as chemical inertness, facile processing, good
mechanical properties, etc.31,32 In our previous work,
our research group reported the effect of graphite, graphene oxide,
and reduced graphene oxide as a filler with NiFe2O4 nanoparticles in polypropylene matrix on its electromagnetic
interference shielding properties.33 In
that work, NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized
by the honey-mediated sol–gel autocombustion method. Further,
our research group investigated the electromagnetic interference shielding
characteristics of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles in
the presence of in situ thermally reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in
polypropylene matrix with the variation of reduced graphene oxide
content.34 In that article, NiFe2O4 spinel ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized by the
starch-mediated sol–gel combustion synthesis approach.

In this present work, the major objective is to prepare NiFe2O4 spinel ferrite nanoparticles via a simple, cost-effective,
and greener approach and to further perform a detailed investigation
on the impact of size of NiFe2O4 spinel ferrite
nanoparticle as a filler with reduced graphene oxide in polypropylene
on its electromagnetic interference shielding characteristics. Therefore,
NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were prepared by dextrin
from the corn-mediated sol–gel combustion method. To the best
of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on the
synthesis of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles by dextrin
from the corn-mediated sol–gel combustion method. Further,
the correlation among particle size, physical properties of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, and electromagnetic interference
shielding characteristics (permittivity, permeability, dielectric
and magnetic loss) with reduced graphene oxide in the polypropylene
matrix is investigated in detail. In addition, the obtained results
indicate that the NiFe2O4–polypropylene
nanocomposite engineered with reduced graphene oxide has provided
high-performance electromagnetic interference shielding characteristics.
A lightweight and flexible nanocomposite with excellent electromagnetic
interference characteristics can be achieved by appropriate-sized
NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with reduced graphene
oxide in the polypropylene matrix. This preparation strategy can be
also utilized to prepare other ferrite nanoparticles and its nanocomposites
for its considerable potential applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction Study
Figure 1a presents the X-ray
diffraction pattern of prepared NiFe2O4 nanoparticles
with annealing at 600, 800, and 1000 °C. All of the XRD patterns
of the prepared NiFe2O4 nanoparticles exhibited
diffraction peaks of the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422),
(511), (440), and (533) crystal planes, corresponding to the spinel
ferrite structure of the NiFe2O4.35 The absence of impurity peak in the XRD patterns
indicate high purity of the synthesized NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. It can be also noticed that the intensity of diffraction
peaks increased with increase of annealing temperature, which signified
the higher crystallinity of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles
prepared at a higher annealing temperature. The average crystallite
size of the prepared spinel ferrite nanoparticles was evaluated through
the Debye–Scherrer equation36  with k = 0.9, λ is
the X-ray wavelength (Cu Kα, 1.5418 Å), β is the
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (311) diffraction peak, and
θ is the diffraction angle. The evaluated crystallite size was
20.6, 34.5, and 68.6 nm for NiFe2O4 nanoparticles
annealed at 600, 800, and 1000 °C, respectively, as mentioned
in Table S1. In addition, the Williamson–Hall
method (Figure S1) and structural parameter
investigation of the prepared nanoparticles are mentioned in detailed Supporting Information. Further, the crystal-phase
information of the prepared reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene
oxide (GO) was acquired by XRD studies, as shown in Figure 1b. The graphene oxide prepared
by Hummer’s method possesses a strong X-ray diffraction peak
at 11.2° associated with the (001) reflection plane. In addition,
the X-ray diffraction pattern of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) exhibits
a diffraction peak at 24.81° corresponding to the (002) plane
and another peak at 43.4° corresponds to the (100) crystal plane
of graphene. Furthermore, the crystal phases of prepared nanocomposites
were acquired by XRD studies, as shown in Figure 1c. It can be noticed that the XRD pattern
of prepared nanocomposite is similar to nanoparticles, and no diffraction
peak corresponding to rGO was noticed due to low X-ray diffraction
intensity of rGO in the prepared nanocomposites.37 In other words, the presence of high diffraction peak intensities
of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles with disappeared peak
of rGO and PP indicates high crystallinity and weight percentage (wt
%) of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles in the prepared
nanocomposite.

Figure 2a depicts
the TEM image of prepared NFD@600 nanoparticles, which indicates the
formation of spherical nanoparticles of size 10–25 nm. Figure 2b presents the HRTEM
image of this nanoparticle, which suggest a lattice distance of 0.25
nm corresponding to the (311) lattice plane of nickel ferrite. It
confirms the crystalline nature of prepared nanoparticles. The TEM
image of the prepared reduced graphene oxide is shown in Figure 2c. It indicates that
the sample exhibits aggregated and crumpled few layers of rGO enclosed
together. Furthermore, the HRTEM image (Figure 2d) of prepared reduced graphene oxide has
a lattice spacing of 0.33 nm.38

Figure 3a–c
depicts the FE-SEM image of the cross section of prepared nanocomposites
NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP. The FE-SEM image
indicates the presence of nickel ferrite and reduced graphene oxide
fillers in the polypropylene matrix. It can be also noticed from Figure 3a–c that smaller
nanosized NiFe2O4 nanoparticles have better
dispersion with reduced graphene oxide in the polypropylene matrix.
The dispersion of nanoparticles in polymer depends on the interfacial
area and interfacial interaction.39 In
addition, the poor dispersion of graphene in nonpolar polymer such
as polypropylene is associated with the large polarity difference
and low interaction energy.40 Further detailed

nanocomposites engineered with reduced graphene oxide characterized

spectroscopy (Figure S3), Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (Figure S4), and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figures S5 and S6) is given in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Magnetic Property of Nanoparticles and Nanocomposites
Figure 4 depicts
magnetic hysteresis curves of the prepared nanoparticles and nanocomposites
at room temperature. It is clear from Figure 4a that all of the samples exhibited ferromagnetic
behavior. The saturation magnetization (Ms), coercivity (Hc), and remanent magnetization
(Mr) for all of the prepared nanoparticles
powder samples are tabulated in Table S2. It is clear from Table S2 that the saturation
magnetization is increased with increase of the crystallite size,
while coercivity and remanent magnetization vary randomly. The values
of saturation magnetization were 32.37, 37.74, and 43.15 emu/g for
NFD@600, NFD@800, and NFD@1000 samples, respectively. Further, the
values of coercivity were 63.65, 93.66, and 9.94 Oe for NFD@600, NFD@800,
and NFD@1000 samples, respectively.

Figure 4 Magnetic hysteresis curves of (a) nanoparticles
and (b) nanocomposites.
The inset is its enlarged view.

It is well known that the magnetic parameters such
as saturation
magnetization, coercivity, and remanent magnetization depend on the
preparation method, microstructure, chemical composition, particle
size, morphology, and cation distribution.41 The increase in saturation magnetization with increase of annealing
temperature is related to the larger particle size and high degree
of crystallinity, resulting in negligible surface spin canting.42 The coercivity of the ferrite nanoparticles
depends on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, strain, interparticle
interaction, particle size, and morphology.43 The value of anisotropy constant can be evaluated by utilizing the
value of coercivity and saturation magnetization in the following
relation44  The evaluated value of anisotropy constant
is listed in Table S2. The magnetic moment
(ηB) observed per unit formula in the Bohr magneton
(μB) is evaluated by the following equation45  where M is the molecular
weight and Ms is the saturation magnetization.
The observed magnetic moments are 1.35, 1.58, and 1.81 μB for NFD@600, NFD@800, and NFD@1000 samples, respectively. Figure 4b presents the magnetic
hysteresis curves of polypropylene (PP) and its prepared nanocomposites
with nickel ferrite nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide. It can
be observed that PP symbolizes nonmagnetic behavior and nanocomposites
ferromagnetic characteristics. The evaluated values of saturation
magnetization (Ms), coercivity (Hc), and remanent magnetization (Mr) from magnetic hysteresis curves for nanocomposites
samples are tabulated in Table S3. The
saturation magnetization values of the nanocomposites were 19.26,
22.95, and 25.29 emu/g for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP
nanocomposite samples, respectively. The saturation magnetization
values of the nanocomposites are smaller than those of nickel ferrite
nanoparticles because of the existence of nonmagnetic rGO and PP in
nanocomposites. Nevertheless, the value of coercivity of nanocomposites
increases as listed in Table S3. The high
value of coercivity can enhance the absorption performance at GHz
due to increased natural resonance frequency of spinel ferrite.46 In addition, the detailed frequency dependence
of dielectric constant (permittivity), ac conductivity, and modulus
spectroscopy characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles in the
frequency range of 1–107 Hz is given in the Supporting
Information (Figure S7).

2.3 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Effectiveness
and Electromagnetic Properties of Nanocomposites
The electromagnetic
interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) is defined as the ratio
of the incident power (PI) and transmitted power (PT) of electromagnetic wave and generally expressed
in the unit of decibel (dB). The electromagnetic interference shielding
effectiveness of the prepared nanocomposites over the frequency range
of 8.2–12.4 GHz with a vector network analyzer has been investigated
using the waveguide method. In addition, the theoretical details of
electromagnetic interference shielding are given in the Supporting Information. Further, Figure 5a–c presents the frequency-dependent
total EMI shielding effectiveness (SET) and its reflection
part (SER) and the absorption loss part (SEA) of prepared nanocomposites. For reflection of incident EM waves,
the shielding material should exhibit mobile charge carriers. It means
that the shielding material should possess good conductivity. For
absorption of incident EM waves, the shielding material must possess
electric and magnetic dipoles. In shielding material, the electric
dipole can be obtained from the material having a high value of dielectric
constant and further the magnetic dipole can be achieved from the
material possessing a high value of magnetic permeability. It can
be noticed from Figure 5 that the values of SET were 45.56, 36.43, and 35.71 dB
for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposites,
respectively. Further, the values of SEA were 28.14, 16.53,
and 18.84 dB for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP,
respectively. In addition, the values of SER were 18.05,
16.34, and 17.28 dB for the prepared nanocomposites NFD@600-rGO-PP,
NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP, respectively.

Figure 5 Frequency-dependent electromagnetic
interference: (a) total shielding
effectiveness (SET), (b) reflection loss (SER), and (c) absorption loss (SEA) for nanocomposites.

The performance of the EMI shielding composite
could be described
in more reality, in terms of specific EMI shielding effectiveness
(SSE, EMI shielding effectiveness divided by density) and absolute
EMI shielding effectiveness (SSE/t, SSE divided by thickness of material)
for its space and defense application where weight and thickness are
important parameter. The evaluated values of SSE were 38.81, 32.79,
and 31.73 dB·cm3/g for the prepared nanocomposites
NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP, respectively.
Further, the calculated values of SSE/t was 388.1, 327.9, and 317.3
dB·cm2/g for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP,
respectively. Recently, Jiantong Li et al.47 have noticed the SSE value of 21.3 dB·cm3/g for
microcellular epoxy/multiwall carbon nanotube nanocomposite foam.
Another research team, Hao-Bin Zhang et al.48 observed the SSE value of 25 dB·cm3/g for graphene–polymer
microcellular foams. Further, Haijun Liu et al.49 reported the SSE value of 37.03 dB·cm3/g
for porous graphene nanoplatelets/Fe3O4/epoxy
nanocomposites. Furthermore, Hongming Zhang et al.50 noticed the SSE value of 50 dB·cm3/g for
microcellular PMMA/Fe3O4@MWCNTs nanocomposite
foam.

The electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness
characteristic
is highly dependent on the complex permittivity (εr = ε′ + ε″) and complex permeability (μr = μ′ + μ″) of the shielding material.
The real part of the permittivity (ε′) and permeability
(μ′) signifies the storage ability, and the imaginary
part of the permittivity (ε″) and permeability (μ″)
signifies the loss ability of electric and magnetic energy51Figure 6a represents the variation of the real part of permittivity
(ε′) of the prepared nanocomposites in the frequency
range of 8.2–12.4 GHz. The values of the real part of permittivity
(ε′) were 5.70–5.86, 5.75–5.97, and 5.67–5.85
for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposite
samples, respectively. The variation of the imaginary part of permittivity
(ε″) over the frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz
is shown in Figure 6b. The observed values of the imaginary part of permittivity (ε″)
were in the ranges of 0.21–0.38, 0.20–0.37, and 0.15–0.36
for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposite
samples, respectively. The results show the variation of complex permittivity
of nanocomposites with variation of particle size of nickel ferrite
nanoparticles in the presence of reduced graphene oxide in the polypropylene
matrix. It can be noticed that the nanocomposite which is consisted
of smaller-size nickel ferrite nanoparticles have improved complex
permittivity, which is associated with the improvement of the degree
of polarization in combination of reduced graphene oxide with smaller-sized
nickel ferrite nanoparticles in the polypropylene matrix.52 Generally, the values of the imaginary part
of permittivity of EMI shielding material are related with the electrical
conductivity and further the high conductivity is beneficial for the
high value of complex permittivity.53 The
relation between electrical conductivity and the imaginary part of
the permittivity (ε″) can be expressed as54  where σAC is the electrical
conductivity, εo is the dielectric constant of the
free space, ε″ is the imaginary part of the permittivity,
and f is the frequency. Figure 6c depicts the variation of electrical conductivity
of prepared nanocomposites over the frequency range of 8.2–12.4
GHz. The values of electrical conductivity were in the ranges of (0.80–1.87)
× 10–3, (0.74–1.82) × 10–3, and (0.58–1.77) × 10–3 S/cm for NFD@600-rGO-PP,
NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposite samples, respectively.
The magnetic filler NiFe2O4 nanoparticles provide
magnetic characteristics to the prepared nanocomposites, which further
improves the EMI shielding characteristics.

Figure 6 (a) Frequency-dependent
real part of permittivity, (b) frequency-dependent
imaginary part of permittivity, (c) ac conductivity, and (d) Cole–Cole
plots, for nanocomposites.

In general, the dielectric loss is generated from
polarization,
namely, Debye dipolar relaxation, interface polarization, and electron
polarization. In addition, the most important mechanism for an electromagnetic
wave-absorbing material is the dielectric relaxation. The polarization
and their related relaxation processes enhance the performance of
shielding material. Cole–Cole plots have been utilized to understand
polarization and their related relaxation process in nanocomposite
shielding material. In view of the Debye theory, the relationship
between ε′ and ε″ can be expressed as55  The plot between ε′ and ε″
should be a single semicircle, corresponding to one Debye relaxation
process, which is assigned as the Cole–Cole semicircle.

Figure 6d depicts
the Cole–Cole plots for prepared nanocomposites. Several multiple
semicircles can be noticed from the Cole–Cole plots of the
nanocomposites, as shown in Figure 6d, which represents diverse relaxation mechanisms such
as Debye dipolar polarization and interface polarization at the heterogeneous
junction among nickel ferrite nanoparticles, reduced graphene oxide,
and polypropylene.56,57 The presence of interfaces in
the heterogeneous nanocomposites provides the interfacial polarizations,
and it is easy to happen in the reduced graphene oxide with relatively
high conductivity, consequently accumulation of charges at interfaces
and the creation of large dipoles on NiFe2O4 nanoparticles.58 Therefore, the interfacial
polarizations and associated relaxations contribute to the EMI shielding
characteristics.

The real part of permeability (μ′)
of the prepared
nanocomposites is shown in Figure 7a. The values of the real part of permeability are
in the ranges of 1.19–2.08, 0.96–1.03, and 0.99–1.91
for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposite
samples, respectively. Figure 7b presents the imaginary part of the permeability (μ″)
of the nanocomposites. The values of the imaginary part of permeability
are in the ranges of 0.06–0.14, 0.01–0.05, and 0.01–0.09
for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP samples, respectively.
The dielectric loss tangent (tan δε =
ε″/ε′) and magnetic loss tangent (tan δμ = μ″/μ′) are two effective
electromagnetic parameters to determine the contribution of dielectric
loss and magnetic loss to the performance of EMI shielding nanocomposites.

Figure 7 Frequency
dependence of (a) the real part of permeability, (b)
the imaginary part of permeability, (c) dielectric tangent loss values,
and (d) magnetic tangent loss values for nanocomposites.

The frequency dependence dielectric loss of the
nanocomposites
is shown in Figure 7c. It can be observed that the dielectric tangent loss values are
in the ranges of 0.030–0.065, 0.027–0.064, and 0.022–0.062
for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP samples, respectively.
It is well known that the dielectric loss is associated with mainly
electric dipole and interfacial polarization. Specially, interfacial
polarization occurs when neighboring fillers have different complex
permittivities and conductivities59 In
prepared nanocomposites, the interface is mainly created between nickel
ferrite nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide in the polypropylene
matrix. The presence of reduced graphene oxide may create electric
dipole due to the presence of defects, chemical species on the surface,
etc.60,61Figure 7d depicts the frequency dependence variation of magnetic
loss of the prepared nanocomposites. The magnetic tangent loss values
are noticed in the ranges of 0.047–0.110, 0.008–0.047,
and 0.010–0.087 for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP
samples, respectively. Normally, the EMI shielding characteristics
of nanocomposites are results of combined contribution of dielectric
and magnetic loss, and consequently, a higher value supports the efficient
performance of the EMI shielding nanocomposites. As shown in Figure 7c,d, the magnetic
tangent loss value is higher than the dielectric loss value, suggesting
that the magnetic loss is the main contributor to the high performance
of the NFD@600-rGO-PP nanocomposite. In general, the magnetic loss
of classified ferrites is associated with eddy current loss, hysteresis
loss, natural resonance, and domain wall resonance.62 For NiFe2O4-rGO-PP nanocomposites,
magnetic loss is due to the time lag of the magnetization vector M, behind the magnetic field vector H. In addition,
a reversible rotational magnetization process occurs under an applied
weak magnetic field to NiFe2O4-rGO nanocomposites.
The permeability at a high frequency is caused by the reversible rotation
of the magnetization vector.63 Under weak
magnetic field, the hysteresis loss is negligible. The domain wall
resonance takes place at a very low frequency range in multidomain
materials. The eddy current is an important parameter for electromagnetic
wave absorption. It is associated with the electrical conductivity
(σ) and thickness (d) of the samples by the
following relation64  where μo and σ are
the permeability in the vacuum and electrical conductivity of the
material, respectively. If with the variation of frequency, Co is constant, then the magnetic loss is caused
by eddy current loss.65 It can be noticed
from Figure 8a that
the value of Co decreases with serious
fluctuations in the whole frequency range, which signifies that the
eddy current effect has no significant contribution to the electromagnetic
wave absorption. In addition, it implies that magnetic loss is caused
by natural resonance instead of the eddy current effect. Further,
the natural resonance loss can be expressed by the following expression66    where |K| is the anisotropic
coefficient, r is the gyromagnetic ratio (2.8 GHz·kOe–1), Ha is the anisotropic
energy, and Ms is the saturation magnetization.
On the one hand, a smaller-size nanoparticle has higher anisotropy
energy due to the surface anisotropic field by the small-size effect.67 On the other hand, it is observed in Figure 4b and Table S3 that the Ms value of the NFD@600-rGO-PP nanocomposite is lower than that of
the NFD@800-rGO-PP and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposites. Therefore,
the anisotropy energy of the NFD@600-rGO-PP nanocomposite is higher.
The higher anisotropy energy is helpful in the improvement of electromagnetic
wave absorption characteristics, particularly at high frequency.68

constant,
and (d) impedance matching coefficient (η) for nanocomposites.

To elucidate the capability of prepared nanocomposites
to shield
the electromagnetic waves, the skin depth, attenuation constant, and
impedance matching coefficient were studied. The high-frequency electromagnetic
wave penetrates only near-surface within the material. This is known
as the skin-depth effect. Skin depth is defined as the depth at which
field drops up to 1/e or 37% times of its original
value.69 It is expressed by the following
relation70  where f is the frequency,
μ is the magnetic permeability of the material, and σ
is the electrical conductivity. Therefore, skin depth has dependence
on frequency, electrical conductivity, and permeability. Figure 8b displays the skin
depth of prepared nanocomposites as a function of frequency. It can
be noticed that the prepared nanocomposites exhibited skin depth in
the range of 0.9–2.6 μm. Generally, a low skin depth
is found in high conductive metals.71 Hence,
the prepared nanocomposites exhibited shielding characteristics as
metals, while in metals, the primarily shielding is due to reflection,
but in our prepared nanocomposites, the primary shielding is due to
absorption.

Further, electromagnetic wave attenuation by EMI
shielding material
is an important factor which plays an important role in the performance
of shielding characteristics. The attenuation constant (α) signifies
the attenuation ability of the shielding material, which can be expressed
by the following relation72  where f and c are the frequency of the electromagnetic wave and velocity of the
light, respectively. The evaluated value of attenuation constant (α)
of the prepared nanocomposites is displayed in Figure 8c. It can be noticed that the NFD@600-rGO-PP
nanocomposite has a larger attenuation constant (α) in comparison
to other nanocomposites with variation of frequency, which implies
better shielding performance of this nanocomposite.

Furthermore,
the impedance matching coefficient (η) can be
evaluated by using the following expression73      where Zo is the
impedance in free space, Z is the impedance of the
shielding nanocomposite material, εr and μr are the relative complex permittivity and permeability of
the shielding nanocomposite material, respectively, εo and μo are the permittivity and permeability of
the vacuum, respectively. The higher impedance matching coefficient
signifies the better impedance matching possessed by the shielding
material.74 In addition, impedance matching
decides how much of electromagnetic wave to propagate into the shielding
material.75Figure 8d depicts the frequency dependence impedance
matching coefficient for prepared nanocomposites. It can be noticed
from Figure 8d that
the NFD@600-rGO-PP nanocomposite provides a high impedance matching
coefficient, resulting in a superior electromagnetic wave absorber.
The prepared NFD@600-rGO-PP nanocomposite exhibited a high value of
attenuation constant as well as impedance matching coefficient; consequently,
it has a superior electromagnetic interference shielding performance.
A detailed schematic demonstration of the electromagnetic interference
shielding mechanism, as discussed above, is shown in Figure 9. The above results demonstrate
that the prepared nanocomposites could be utilized as a high-performance
electromagnetic interference shielding material.

shielding for prepared nanocomposites of nickel ferrite nanoparticles

2.4 Mechanical Properties of Nanocomposites
The mechanical properties of nanocomposites strongly depend on
size, morphology, and interfacial adhesion between the components.76,77Figure 10 displays
a typical stress–strain behavior of the prepared nanocomposites.
The tensile properties of the prepared nanocomposites are shown in Table S4. The values of evaluated Young’s
modulus are 33.34, 28.19, and 24.55 MPa for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP,
and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposites, respectively. Further, the values
of tensile strength are 1.89, 2.21, and 2.36 MPa for NFD@600-rGO-PP,
NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposites, respectively.
In addition, the values of elongation at break are 24.01, 77.38, and
259.34% for NFD@600-rGO-PP, NFD@800-rGO-PP, and NFD@1000-rGO-PP nanocomposites,
respectively. The above results indicate that the size of nickel ferrite
nanoparticle evidently also affects the mechanical characteristics
of prepared nanocomposites.78

curves of prepared nanocomposites.

3 Conclusions
In this work, various sizes
of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles
were synthesized by dextrin-mediated sol–gel combustion method,
followed by annealing at 600, 800, and 1000 °C. The annealing
temperature played an important role in tuning particle size and physical
characteristics of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. In
addition, the particle size played an important role in controlling
the electromagnetic interference shielding performance and the electromagnetic
properties of nanocomposites based on nickel ferrite nanoparticles
with reduced graphene oxide as a nanofiller in the polypropylene matrix.
For nanocomposites with a smaller-sized NiFe2O4 nanoparticle as a filler with reduced graphene oxide, the maximum
total shielding effectiveness reaches 45.56 dB at thickness 2 mm.
The main electromagnetic interference shielding mechanism is magnetic
loss, dielectric loss, synergetic effect, high value of attenuation
constant, and good impedance matching. The prepared nanocomposites
are a promising material for electromagnetic interference shielding
application.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Dextrin from corn Type
I powder, graphite flakes, and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were the products of Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. Sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was purchased from Lach-Ner, the Czech Republic. Nickel
nitrate and iron nitrate were products of Alfa Aesar GmbH & Co.
KG (Germany). Polypropylene (Vistamaxx 6202) was a product of Exxon
Mobil (Machelen, Belgium). Vitamin C (Livsane) was a product of Dr.
Kleine Pharma GmbH, Germany.

4.2 Synthesis of Nanoparticles
Nanofiller
spinel ferrite NiFe2O4 was prepared by the dextrin-mediated
sol–gel combustion method. Analytical-grade nickel nitrate
(Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), iron nitrate
(Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), and dextrin
from corn, (C6H10O5)n, were utilized as the starting materials and were
dissolved in deionized water. The mixed solution was stirred and heated
at 110 °C. After 3 h of continuous stirring and heating, the
mixed solution was converted into a viscous gel. This formed gel was
heated at 310 °C until it is automatically converted into a fluffy
spinel ferrite powder by self-combustion. Then, the as-prepared powder
was further annealed at 600, 800, and 1000 °C to achieve a set
of spinel ferrite nanoparticles of varied particle size. A schematic
illustration of the synthesis of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles
by the dextrin-mediated sol–gel combustion method is shown
in Figure 11. The
resultant NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were termed
as NFD@600, NFD@800, and NFD@1000 corresponding to annealing at 600,
800, and 1000 °C. The formation of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles by the dextrin-mediated sol–gel combustion
method can be expressed by the following equation  

Figure 11 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of
NiFe2O4 nanoparticles by the dextrin-mediated
sol–gel combustion
method.

4.3 Synthesis of Graphene Oxide (GO) and Reduced
Graphene Oxide (rGO)
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized
by the modified Hummer’s method.79 The detailed preparation procedure of graphene oxide (GO) is shown
in the Supporting Information. For the
preparation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), vitamin C was utilized
as a reducing agent. The prepared graphene oxide was mixed in deionized
water with ultrasonication for 15 min. Then, vitamin C was added slowly
to the solution, and the suspension was stirred for 3 h at 90 °C.
The obtained product was centrifuged and washed with deionized water.
Finally, it was annealed at 60 °C for 15 h to get reduced graphene
powder (rGO) powder.

4.4 Preparation of Nanocomposites
Nanocomposites
of polypropylene (40 wt %) with nanofiller (55 wt % NiFe2O4 + 5 wt % rGO) were prepared. Nanofillers and polypropylene
were premixed and then compounded by Micro-compounder Xplore MC15
(DSM Xplore Instruments BV, Sittard, the Netherlands). Melt treatment
was conducted at 200 °C for 5 min with a speed of 50 rpm. The
sheets of nanocomposites were prepared by the hot-press method. These
sheets of nanocomposites were utilized for structural and physical
characterization of nanocomposites. Three nanocomposite samples, namely,
(i) NFD@600-rGO-PP, (ii) NFD@800-rGO-PP, and (iii) NFD@1000-rGO-PP,
were prepared. A digital photograph of the prepared NFD@600-rGO-PP
nanocomposite is shown in Figure 12.

and efficient

4.5 Characterization
The crystal structure
and phase purity of nanoparticles and nanocomposites were examined
by X-ray powder diffraction (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Raman
spectroscopy measurements of nanoparticles and nanocomposites were
examined by a Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The morphology of the nanoparticles
was studied with a scanning electron microscope (FEI NanoSEM450).
The cross section of nanocomposites was prepared by freeze-fracturing
in liquid nitrogen and then utilized for the field emission scanning
electron microscope. Further, the morphology of nanoparticles was
characterized by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope
Jeol JEM 2100. XPS images of nanoparticles were measured with an X-ray
photoelectron spectroscope (Kratos Analytical Ltd.). The magnetic
hysteresis curves of nanoparticles and nanocomposites were measured
by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM 7407, Lake Shore). The
electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of
the prepared nanocomposite was investigated using vector network analyzer
(Agilent N5230A) in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz (X
band). The EMI SE of the nanocomposite was measured using a 23.4 ×
10.2 × 2.0 mm3 sheet of prepared nanocomposites, which
was fit into a waveguide sample holder. The EMI SE characteristics
of the prepared nanocomposites were evaluated from the scattering
(S) parameters, which was utilized to estimate total shielding effectiveness
(SET), reflection loss (SER), and absorption
loss (SEA). A tensile test of the prepared nanocomposites
was carried out on a Testometric universal testing machine of type
M 350-5CT (Testometric Co. Ltd., Rochdale, UK), equipped with a load
cell of 300 kN.
