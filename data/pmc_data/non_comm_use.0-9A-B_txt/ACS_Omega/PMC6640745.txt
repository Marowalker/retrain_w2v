We
observed the crystallization process in poly(l-lactic
acid) (PLLA) and poly(d-lactic acid) (PDLA) blends using
in situ simultaneous small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements
with a high-speed temperature control cell. In situ X-ray scattering
measurements revealed that density fluctuations larger than the long
spacing periods grew during crystallization above 130 °C. In
particular, the time evolution of the density fluctuations has a strong
dependence on the crystallization temperature. The density fluctuations
will promote the crystal nucleation and growth processes of the stereocomplex
and increase with increasing crystallization temperature, which is
strongly correlated with the complexation of PLLA and PDLA chains.
On the other hand, below 120 °C, the kinetics of stereocomplex
formation might be hindered by the decreased mobility, and no density
fluctuations were observed in the case of homo crystal growth of PLLA
or PDLA.

Introduction
Plant-derived poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) has been widely
used as an alternative to petroleum-based polymers because of its
superior eco-friendliness.1−6 PLLA materials are preferred for practical use and are now manufactured
commercially. However, the application of PLLA materials is limited
because of their high cost, inferior thermal stability, mechanical
properties, and processability compared with conventional petroleum-based
polymers such as isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene. Acceleration
of crystal nucleation or the increase in crystallinity has been investigated
to overcome these disadvantages. For example, cross-linking PLLA,7−9 the use of nucleating agents,10−12 and stereocomplex (Sc) crystallization13−17 were reported owing to the improvement in PLLA crystallization processes.18,19

However, the cross-linking PLLA and the use of nucleating
agents
might be effective but are limited to improving the properties. In
particular, Sc crystallization achieved by blending PLLA with poly(d-lactic acid) (PDLA) is known to improve the mechanical performance,
thermal properties, hydrolytic degradation, and gas barrier properties
of PLLA.15,20 This is in part because of the higher melting
temperature (Tm) of the Sc crystals (Tm = 210–230 °C) relative to the
α crystalline forms of PLLA or PDLA (Tm = 160–180 °C). This elevated Tm is, in turn, attributed to the structures of the Sc
crystals, which comprise equimolar l- and d-lactide
unit sequences packed side by side. As a result of this packing, the
interactions between the PLLA and PDLA chains are stronger than those
among the PLLA or PDLA chains within the respective α crystalline
forms of these materials. The growth of Sc crystals of PLLA and PDLA
is much faster than that of the α crystalline form at the same
crystallization temperature (Tc).

In the previous studies, Sc crystal fibers were prepared from mixed
solutions of PLLA and PDLA using wet- and dry-spinning processes,
and the higher-order structures and the mechanical properties of melt-spun
fibers from blends of PLLA and PDLA were characterized.21,22 Polarized optical microscopy (POM) images of the fibril crystals
revealed shish-kebab-like crystals of PLLA formed from the sheared
melt.23 To improve the mechanical and thermal
properties of polylactic acid (PLA), it is very important to enhance
the overall crystallization rate. Therefore, our group previously
investigated the nucleation and the crystal growth processes under
shear flow using the blends of PLLA and PDLA.24 The time required for nucleation decreased with increasing shear
rate and strain, and we observed a weak lamellar crystal orientation
parallel to the shear direction rather than an oriented crystal lattice
and shish-kebab structure. Because the shear rates were larger than
the inverse of the estimated reptation time, convective constraint
release was identified as the dominant mode. Thus, it was concluded
that the crystal nucleation was enhanced by the stretched chains produced
upon the disentanglement of the PLLA or PDLA chain network. Furthermore,
density fluctuations before crystal nucleation were observed above
100 nm. These results suggest that the density fluctuations might
form only in the mixed PLLA/PDLA phase even in the quiescent state.
In the previous reports, we observed the precursor on a micron scale
during the crystallization process. The precursor was formed from
a stretched polymer network owing to entanglements and small crystallites25,26 under shear flow. Furthermore, the precursors, that is, the density
fluctuations grown during the induction time before crystallization,
were observed in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET),27 polyethylene (naphthalate),28 and isotactic polypropylene (iPP)29 crystallization. A similar time evolution of the density fluctuations
before the crystallization process was observed and described as a
spinodal-decomposition-type phase separation.30 Furthermore, Nishida et al.27 found that
the micron-scale density fluctuations could be observed immediately
after fast quenching below Tm in polypropylene
crystallization.

However, in the case of PLLA/PDLA blend, it
is not clear whether
these density fluctuations were observed. Then, it is necessary to
observe the structure formation processes before nucleation even below Tm of the homo crystal. In the case of PLLA,
melting and reorganization of the δ-phase31−33 have been analyzed
as a function of heating rate for heating rates between 10–1 and 103 °C/s.34 The reorganization
from the δ-phase to the α-phase occurs when the heating
rate is lower than 30 °C/s and under isothermal annealing at
150–160 °C. Therefore, we investigate the crystallization
of PLLA/PDLA blends under high-speed quenching, which is similar to
polymer processing, with a high-speed temperature jump hot stage.
The cell developed
by Nishida et al. was installed in a synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering
apparatus.35 This hot stage enabled the
observation of very fast structural formations, similar to those in
polymer processing. Furthermore, the formation of mesophase iPP was
observed by a fast differential scanning calorimetry (fast DSC).36 In this study, to analyze the structure formation
from nanometers to microns in PLLA/PDLA blends during isothermal crystallization
from the melt, we performed in situ POM and synchrotron X-ray scattering
measurements using a high-speed temperature jump hot stage.

Experimental
Procedure
Materials
PLLA and PDLA samples with weight average
molecular masses Mw of 1.66 × 105 and 1.79 × 105, respectively, and a polydispersity Mw/Mn of 2.0 were
provided by Teijin Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). A PLLA/PDLA blend with a 1:1
weight ratio was extruded for 3 min at 240 °C and pelletized.
The pellets were melted in a vacuum oven at 240 °C for 2 min
and then quenched to 0 °C using a cooling gas to obtain amorphous
blend films. Subsequently, the amorphous films were dried for 1 day
in a vacuum oven at room temperature to remove water. We confirmed
the amorphous nature of the quenched samples using wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS).

High-Speed Temperature Jump Stage
The temperature jump
stage consists of two thermally separated heat blocks developed by
Nishida et al.35 The temperature of each
heat block was regulated independently. The sample cell consisted
of a spacer rim and a pair of window materials (aluminum foil for
X-ray scattering measurements and glass for optical microscopy). The
sample films were cooled from the molten state to various Tc values using the temperature jump stage and
annealed within the sample stage according to the protocol depicted
in Figure 1. The sample
thickness in the cell was 200 μm for all experiments. The temperatures
used in the analysis were the temperatures calibrated using the actual
temperatures measured at the sample position.

protocol for the PLLA/PDLA blends.

Simultaneous Small- and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering Measurements
Simultaneous time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
and WAXS measurements were performed at the BL40B2 beam lines at SPring-8
in Nishi-Harima, Japan. The wavelength of the incident X-ray beams
was 0.10 nm. Time-resolved SAXS profiles were recorded using charge-coupled
device cameras (C4742-98, Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Japan),
and an image intensifier was used for time-resolved WAXS measurements
(C9728DK-10, Hamamatsu Photonics KK). The sample-to-detector lengths
for SAXS and WAXS profiles were 1765 and 75 mm, respectively. The
lengths of the scattering vector q in the SAXS and
WAXS measurements were 0.07–1.5 and 5–22 nm–1, respectively, where q = 4π sin θ/λ
(where 2θ and λ are the scattering angle and the wavelength,
respectively). The scattered X-ray beams were detected at 3 s intervals.

Crystallinity Evaluation
The fractions of Sc and homo
crystals in the isothermally crystallized samples were estimated using
WAXS. The time evolution of the crystallinities of the Sc and homo
crystals [Xc,Sc(t) and Xc,H(t), respectively] was determined
from the WAXS profiles. In particular, for a q-range
of 5.0–18.0 nm–1, Xc,Sc and Xc,H were calculated using
the area of the diffraction peaks for the corresponding crystals relative
to the total area between the diffraction profile and the baseline.
These peaks were located at q = 8.5, 14.9, and 17.0
nm–1 for the Sc crystals and q =
8.9, 10.6, 12.1, 13.5, 15.9, and 16.6 nm–1 for the
homo crystals. These calculations were conducted using the following
equations    where ISc, IH, and IA are the
diffraction peak areas for the Sc crystal, homo crystal, and amorphous
fraction, respectively.

Results and Discussion
We observed
the linear growth of spherulites above 140 °C
using polarized optical microscopy [VHX-900 digital microscope manufactured
by Keyence Corp. (Osaka, Japan)]. The morphologies of spherulites
of the homo and Sc crystals were the same as shown in Figures S1 and S2. Therefore, it is difficult
to discuss whether the spherulites consist of Sc and/or homo crystals
only from the results of POM images. We conducted simultaneous WAXS
and SAXS measurements to analyze the crystal growth and nucleation
processes in more detail.

The time evolution of the WAXS profiles
of the samples crystallized
from the melt at various temperatures is shown in Figure 2. At 190 °C, which is
above the Tm of homo crystals, the most
intense peak is observed at q = 8.5 nm–1, which is attributed to the (110) plane. In the cases of Tc values above the Tm of homo crystals, the profiles are assigned to the β-form
of Sc crystals, which is triclinic with parameters a = 0.916 nm, b = 0.916 nm, c (fiber
axis) = 0.870 nm, α = 109.2°, β = 109.2°, and
γ = 109.8°, where the molecules are assumed to have a 3/1
helical conformation.37 By contrast,
at 150 °C, which is just below the Tm of homo crystals, the most intense peak was observed at q = 8.5 nm–1, which is attributed to the
(110) plane. The weak peaks at q = 10.6 nm–1 are assigned to the (110) and/or (200) planes of the PLLA homo crystals.
For Tc values between the Tm of the homo crystals and 120 °C, the profiles comprise
both the β-form of the Sc crystals and the α-form of the
homo crystals, which is orthorhombic with parameters a = 1.07 nm, b = 0.645 nm, and c (fiber axis) = 2.78 nm, where the molecules are assumed to have
a 10/3 helical conformation.33 Furthermore,
at 110 °C, the most intense peak is attributed to the (200) and/or
(110) planes of the PLLA (or PDLA) homo crystals. The profiles comprise
both Sc crystals and the α′-form of the homo crystals,
which is pseudohexagonal with a = b = 0.62 nm, and c (fiber axis) = 2.78 nm, where
the molecules are assumed to have a 3/1 helical conformation.6

Figure 2 WAXS profiles for samples crystallized at 190 °C
(a), 150
°C (b), and 110 °C (c). The boxes of the attribution peaks
were assigned to PLLA (or PDLA) homo crystal diffractions.

Figure 3a–c
shows the time evolution of Xc,Sc, Xc,H, and the fraction of the amorphous region Am [Am(t) = 1 – (Xc,Sc(t) + Xc,H(t)] for samples
crystallized at 190, 150, and 110 °C, respectively. At 190 °C
(Figure 3a), Xc,Sc increases with crystallization time after
an induction period of 30 s. The induction period is defined as the
onset time of increasing crystallinity from the baseline. Under this
temperature condition, (110) and (030)/(300) diffraction peaks are
observed at 8.5 and 14.9 nm–1, respectively, as
shown in Figure 2a.
After 1000 s of crystallization, only the β-form of the Sc crystals
is observed because the temperature is above the Tm of the homo crystals. At this time, Xc,Sc is approximately 0.20. Figure 3b shows that the Sc crystallization starts
after an induction period of 30 s and that the homo crystallization
of PLLA or PDLA starts after 200 s. The growth of Sc crystals begins
much sooner than the growth of homo crystals because the quenching
depth of the Sc crystal is much larger than that of the homo crystal. Xc,Sc is larger than Xc,H for the first 400 s; however, the growth rate of the homo crystal
increases after this point. Thus, Xc,Sc (0.20) is smaller than Xc,H (0.33) after
1800 s. This finding suggests that Sc crystals could accelerate the
growth of homo crystal under this condition. Even in the deeper quenching
case at 110 °C, as shown in Figure 3c, we observe strong diffraction peaks for
homo crystals in the induction period of 60 s. After homo crystallization,
the growth of Sc crystals is observed for 200 s. Under these low Tc conditions, the crystal growth of Sc was prevented.
In general, the growth rate and the nucleation rate of crystals depend
on the quenching depth, that is, Tc. The
highest crystallization rate occurs between Tm and the glass transition temperature (Tg = 63.0 °C), whereas the rates near Tg and Tm are quite slow. Even
after 1200 s of crystallization at 110 °C, Xc,Sc is only 0.03. In this case, Sc crystallization was
inhibited because Tc was too close to
the Tg of PLLA/PDLA blends.

Figure 3 Time evolution
of the fraction of the crystallinity of Sc crystals
(Xc,Sc), crystallinity of homo crystals
(Xc,H), and the amorphous region (Am) for the crystallization temperatures of 190
(a), 150 (b), and 110 °C (c). The induction period is defined
as the onset time of increasing crystallinity from the baseline.

To analyze the crystal nucleation
process, we focused on the time
at which Xc,Sc(t) and Xc,H(t) began to increase under
various crystallization temperatures. Figure 4a shows the dependence of the onset time
on Tc. At high temperatures (above 180
°C), the onset time of the growth of Sc crystals increases with
temperature because of a reduction in the quenching depth. Between
180 and 120 °C, the onset time of the growth of Sc crystals is
almost independent of Tc within error
bars. These results suggest that Sc nucleation is quite slow even
when the quenching is deep; this highly unexpected phenomenon is discussed
below using the SAXS profiles recorded. By contrast, the homo crystal
nucleation became faster with the increasing quenching depth of the
homo crystals. Below 110 °C, the onset of homo crystallization
occurs sooner than that of Sc crystallization. Tsuji found that the Tg value of Sc crystals for a PLLA/PDLA blend
is higher than that for pure PLLA or PDLA samples.18,19 This might be one of the possible reasons for the homo crystallization
process that takes place sooner than the Sc crystallization process.

Figure 4 Temperature
dependence of the time at which the crystallinities
of the Sc and homo crystals [Xc,Sc(t) and Xc,H(t), respectively] begin to increase (onset time) (a) and Xc,Sc(t) and Xc,H(t) at crystallization after 1800 s (b).

We investigated the time evolution of the nano-
and submicron-scale
structures via in situ SAXS measurements for a more detailed analysis
of the crystal nucleation process. Figure 4b shows Xc,Sc and Xc,H after 1800 s. Between 210 and
180 °C, only the diffraction pattern for Sc crystals could be
observed because Tc is higher than the Tm of the homo crystals. Below 170 °C, diffraction
patterns were observed for both Sc and homo crystals. In general,
PLLA (or PDLA) crystallization is quite slow, and it is difficult
to observe homo crystals at Tc above 170
°C because of the shallow quenching depth. In our measurement
of this PLLA sample, crystallization at 150 °C begins after 300
s of annealing, and no crystal growth occurs above 160 °C. These
results suggest that the Sc crystal could act as a nucleating agent
for the homo crystals. In the case of crystallization near Tg, both crystallinity values decreased rapidly
with the decreasing temperature. In particular, the Sc crystallinity
is less than 2%, the homo crystallinity is above 10%, and the onset
of homo crystallization occurs sooner than Sc crystallization below
120 °C. On the basis of these results, homo crystals do not seem
to act as nucleating agents for Sc crystallization because of the
proximity of Tc and Tg. In these cases, the polymer chains undergo a less diffusive
motion.

Figure 5 shows the
time evolution of the SAXS profiles for samples crystallized at 190
(a), 150 (b), and 110 °C (c). After crystallization,
the long spacing period can be observed around q =
0.2–0.3 nm–1. The long spacing period L was evaluated from the peak positions qpeak using the relation L = 2π/qpeak. In general, L increases with Tc because
of the increasing thickness of the lamellar structure and the amorphous
region. Furthermore, very-large-scale fluctuations were noted during
the crystal growth below q = 0.1 nm–1, as shown by arrows in Figure 5a,b. Such large-scale fluctuations were previously
observed in the crystallization of PLLA/PDLA blends under shear flow.24 By contrast, no increasing intensity in the
low-q region was observed after crystallization (Figure 5c); therefore, the
large density fluctuations could not grow. On the basis of these results,
these large fluctuations might be observed only in the case of the
nucleation of Sc crystals. We subtracted the SAXS profiles of the
molten state from each SAXS profile to clarify the growth process
from the molten state.28Figure 6 shows the time evolution of
the subtracted intensity immediately after quenching to Tc at 190 °C (Figure 6a) and 150 °C (Figure 6b). The onset of crystallization occurs at
30 s for these crystallization temperatures. Even before nucleation,
the difference in intensity increases with time, especially below q = 0.10 nm–1; therefore, the submicron-scale
density fluctuations increased with time. The intensity continues
to grow after crystal nucleation because of the growth of the lamellar
structure. Of course, the subtracted intensity in the case of 110
°C crystallization is approximately zero after crystallization
below q = 0.10 nm–1; then there
are no density fluctuations before the nucleation of homo crystals.

Figure 5 SAXS profiles
recorded at various times during crystallization
at 190 (a), 150 (b), and 110 °C (c). The arrows show the very-large-scale
fluctuations in (a) and (b).

Figure 6 Difference in intensity in the low-q region (q = 0.072–0.18 nm–1) measured at
different times during crystallization at 190 (a) and 150 °C
(b).

To evaluate the time evolution
of the submicron-scale density fluctuations
on Sc crystallization excluding the growth of the lamellar crystal,
we calculated the integrated intensity of the SAXS profiles in the
region of q = 0.072–0.1 nm–1; the results are presented in Figure 7. In the case of crystallization above 180 °C,
only the growth of Sc crystals was observed because this temperature
is above the Tm of the homo crystals.
A previous study insisted that density fluctuations before nucleation
were present only in the case of Sc crystallization at 190 °C.24 Additionally, in this study, density fluctuations
could be observed before the nucleation of Sc crystals for Tc even below the Tm of the homo crystal. The integrated intensity decreases with decreasing Tc. Below 120 °C, we could not note any
growth of the submicron-scale density fluctuations; however, above
130 °C, the density fluctuations increased with crystallization
time even before nucleation. There are two possible reasons for such
a growth of density fluctuations before crystallization. One reason
is that these fluctuations might be due to incomplete mixing of the
PLLA and PDLA chains in the molten state of the sample blended above
240 °C.24 The melting temperatures
of homo and Sc crystals were observed using DSC measurements even
in the case of both melt-pressed and cast films mixed in a dilute
solution because of the incomplete mixing of these chains. However,
it is quite strange
due to the same chemical structural formulas between PLLA and PDLA;
therefore, the interaction parameter (i.e., the χ parameter)
between PLLA and PDLA will be zero, and it looks inconsistent. The
other reason is that Sc nucleation and growth processes induce the
submicron-scale density fluctuations.24,38Figure 7 shows that the density fluctuations
increase with Tc. Furthermore, the crystallinity
of Sc increases with Tc until just below
200 °C in Figure 4b. From these results, the submicron-scale density fluctuations have
a strong correlation with the formation of Sc crystals and/or Sc nucleation.
Furthermore, even before crystal nucleation, we could observe the
density fluctuations. Some research groups suggest density fluctuation-assisted
crystallization,39−41 especially before nucleation. However,
the density fluctuations of PLLA/PDLA blends might be different from
density-fluctuation-assisted crystallization because of the absence
of phase separation processes in PLLA/PDLA blends. In our previous
study on the crystallization of PLLA/PDLA blend samples under shear
flow, we found that the scale of the density fluctuations ranged from
several tens to hundreds of nanometers.24 From Figure 7, the
density fluctuations above 60 nm (q = 0.1 nm–1) might depend on the crystallinity of Sc shown in Figure 4b. However, it is
difficult to discuss the growth process of these density fluctuations
because of observation of only the tails of peaks. These results suggest
that the submicron-scale density fluctuations are strongly correlated
with the complexation process composed of PLLA and PDLA chains. In
other words, the nucleation process of Sc crystals was accelerated
by density fluctuations above 60 nm. In the case of low Tc, the kinetics of Sc crystals might be hindered by the
decreased mobility; then no density fluctuations were observed, especially
in the case of the homo crystal growth of PLLA or PDLA.

at q = 0.072–0.1 nm–1 for
various Tc values.

Conclusions
During the PLLA/PDLA blend crystallization,
density fluctuations
larger than the long spacing period grow over time, even before the
nucleation of Sc crystals. We could observe the very large density
fluctuations above 130 °C. The density fluctuations will promote
the crystal nucleation and growth processes of Sc crystals and increase
with increasing Tc. Especially, the time
evolution of the density fluctuations has a strong dependence on Tc. The nucleation processes of Sc crystals were
accelerated by the submicron-scale density fluctuations. In the case
of low Tc, the kinetics of Sc might be
hindered by the decreased mobility; then no density fluctuations were
observed, especially in the case of the homo crystal growth of PLLA
or PDLA.
