Recent research results report that
extracellular vesicles (EVs)
have a central role in both physiological and pathological processes
involving intercellular communication. Herein, a simple EVs labeling
procedure based on the metabolic labeling of secreting cells (mesenchymal
stroma cells, MSCs) with a fluorescein-containing bio-orthogonal dye
is described. This procedure was carried out by incubating cells for
72 h with tetraacetylated N-azidoacetyl-d-mannosamine (Ac4ManNAz), a modified sugar containing
an azido group that, upon incorporation on the external surface of
the cytoplasmatic cell membrane, is specifically conjugated with cyclooctyne-modified
fluorescein isothiocyanate (ADIBO-FITC). MSCs released fluorescent
EVs did not need any further purification. Finally, cellular uptake
and tracking of the fluorescein-labeled EVs were successfully assessed
by targeting experiments with MSCs. The method appears of general
applicability and it may be very useful opening new horizon on diagnostic
and therapeutic protocols exploiting EVs.

Introduction
It is now well established
that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are
a powerful tool for intercellular communication.1 They consist of a heterogeneous population of double layers
membrane fragments that are released by most cell types.2 EVs can carry a payload made of molecules such
as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that are uptaken by target
cells, influencing their fate.3−6 In particular, a pro-regenerative ability has been
ascribed to EVs released by stem cells, that act by stimulating recipient
cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, and favoring immune escape.7−10 The use of stem cell derived EVs is currently under intense scrutiny,
as a novel putative therapeutic option. In fact, it has been reported
that EVs released by mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) resulted highly
efficient in the treatment of several pathologies in preclinical experimental
models.11,12 A very promising characteristics of EVs
relies in their ability to transport genetic information, as well
as drugs and proteins, to target cells. In addition, EVs possess unique
properties including (i) enhanced passive targeting due to their small
size, (ii) excellent biological acceptance due to their endogenous
nature, and (iii) ability to cross biological barriers. Their natural
potential to transfer biological materials from one cell to another
can be enhanced or customized to enable a wide range of therapeutic
applications through the introduction of molecules that facilitate
targeting, uptake, and loading of EVs. To improve the use of MSC EVs,
it is essential to track EV biodistribution in vivo. Moreover, conjugation
of imaging probes to the surface of EVs that allows their not-invasive
detection is an important challenge. Currently, labeling strategies
used are based essentially on the use of highly lipophilic fluorescent
dyes, able to stain artificial and biological membranes thanks to
the presence of lipophilic long-chains functionalized with cyanine
moieties (i.e., PKH, DiD, DiI, and R18).13−15 The aliphatic
chain rapidly intercalates into the EVs lipid bilayer, thus providing
the fluorescent labeling of the particles. Unfortunately, the protocols
used to remove dye aggregates nonbound to EVs lipidic membrane are
often insufficient, leading to the occurrence of many false positive
results.16,17 For these reasons, it appears useful to
find alternative, easy, and fast labeling procedures that avoid the
unspecific incorporation into the membrane of both EVs and MSCs as
in the case of lipophilic dyes. Herein, we report our results on an
EV labeling procedure with fluorescent dyes based on the bio-orthogonal
copper-free click chemistry approach. In recent years, the bio-orthogonal
approach has attracted considerable attention for cell labeling and/or
tracking because of its high specificity and low toxicity to cells.18−20 Among the possible bio-orthogonal approaches, the rapid, biocompatible,
and specific chemical reaction between the functionalized dibenzocyclooctyne
and azido-sugars generated on the cell surface by metabolic glycoengineering
has shown great potential.21−23 Thus, applying this approach,
cancer cells labeling strategies and targeted delivery of nanoparticles
have been recently developed and validated also in vivo.24−28

Thus, first, the metabolic labeling of MSCs with tetraacetylated N-azidoacetyl-d-mannosamine (Ac4ManNAz)
was carried out to generate unnatural azide groups on the surface
of the cells. This task was accomplished by growing MSC cells in the
presence of the modified sugar, and then the azide groups specifically
and efficiently reacted with fluorescein conjugated aza-dibenzocyclooctyne
(ADIBO-FITC) (Figure 1) via the Cu-free 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. A similar bio-orthogonal
approach has been very recently used by Lee et al.29 to label exosomes isolated by breast cancer cells (MCF7
and MDA-MB-231) with a Cy3 fluorescent dye. However, stem cells and
MSCs used in this work possess completely different characteristics
compared with tumor cells, in terms of metabolism, size, growth rate,
and phenotypic markers. In addition, MSCs may have different extent
of extracellular glycan formation with respect to tumor cells and
different amount of exosomes secreted.

Figure 1 Description of the bio-orthogonal
labeling procedure of EVs.

Results and Discussion
Mesenchymal Stroma Cells Labeling
To expose azide groups
on the surface of MSCs, the cells were incubated in the presence of
a solution of Ac4ManNAz (50 μM in 0.25 v/v % ethanol
in MSC basal medium) for 72 h at 37 °C (5% CO2). Azide-modified
sugars were incorporated through existing biosynthetic pathways both
onto the cell surface and on internal glycans. After incorporation,
the unnatural azide group is available for reaction with the stable
ADIBO-FITC (Figure 1). Thus, a further incubation of 30′ at 37 °C in the
presence of 40 μM ADIBO-FITC (0.2 v/v % ethanol in MSC basal
medium) was carried out to allow the Cu-free click chemistry reaction
to occur on cell surface. Then, after washing, the fluorescent labeling
on MSCs was assessed by flow cytometry. As reported in Figure 2A, the fluorescence signal
of MSCs treated with Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC was much
higher with respect to control cells treated only with ADIBO-FITC,
confirming the successful labeling of the cells via the click reaction.
Different aliquots of the same cell samples were then lysated and
analyzed by spectrofluorimetry (Figure 2B). The amount of FITC bound to MSCs was quantified
based on a FITC standard curve, and it was normalized to the total
protein content of cells determined by the Bradford method. Figure 2B confirms the results
obtained by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, thus
evidencing the absence of a nonspecific binding of ADIBO-FITC to the
cell cytosolic membrane in comparison with Ac4ManNAz-treated
cells. This clearly demonstrated that the amount of exposed azide
groups was sufficient to allow the detection of labeled MSCs. No 
advantages were observed when different concentrations of ADIBO-FITC
(15 and 60 μM) were used (Supporting Information Figure S1).

or in the absence of Ac4ManNAz. Fluorescence values measured
on cell lysates (upon treatment with triton 0.1%) were normalized
to the total cell protein content determined by Bradford assay. Data
are the mean ± SE of seven different experiments. **p = 0.0024, Student t-test.

To assess whether MSC labeling was maintained over time,
cells
previously treated with Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC were kept
in culture for additional 5 days. FACS analysis of MSCs was performed
at day 3 and day 5. Figure 3 shows that 5 days after cell labeling the fluorescence decreased
of about 30% according to the MSC growth rate. Importantly, the incubation
of MSCs with Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC did not affect morphology
and surface markers (Supporting Information Figure S2) and showed a 70 ± 5% cells viability, measured by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay, compared with not-treated control cells. In addition, treatment
with Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC did not alter the MSCs endocytic
pathway as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence for specific
molecules of different endocytic compartments. Figure 4 shows that MSCs with ADIBO-FITC with or
without Ac4ManNAz have similar distribution and intensity
of EEA1, Rab 5, that localize in early endosome, and they are involved
in vesicle trafficking and Lamp-1 a lysosomal marker. Moreover, MSCs
treated or not with Ac4ManNAz did not reveal significant
changes of Tia-1 expression, that is, mRNA binding proteins that during
stress conditions localize into stress granules.

magnification 63x.

Labeled MSCs Released Fluorescent
EVs
Cell supernatants
were collected from fluorescent MSCs (Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC
treated) cultured overnight in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
without serum, for EVs purification. Labeled EVs were then obtained
by ultracentrifugation. The advantage of the labeling protocol herein
proposed is that unbound dyes are eliminated directly during MSC cells
washing, and fluorescent exosomes are produced directly by cells and
do not need any further purification. On the contrary, the procedure
reported by Lee et al.29 was more laborious
and required a purification through a PD SpinTrap G25 column. In particular,
breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) were metabolically labeled
with Ac4ManNAz and then exosomes were isolated by the cells
and then labeled with the ADIBO-fluorescent dye molecules (1 h at
37 °C), and finally purified by gel filtration.

Labeled
EVs were characterized by NanoSight analyses, Guava cytofluorimeter,
and spectrofluorimetric analysis. EVs’ number and size were
quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). As shown in Figure 5A, the size distribution
(nm) of EVs released by Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC (165.5
± 11 nm) or ADIBO-FITC (173 ± 7 nm) treated MSCs was similar
to the one of nonlabeled EVs (174 ± 2 nm), demonstrating that
the ADIBO-FITC exposure on the EV membranes did not affect the EV
size. Moreover, cytofluorimetric analyses, performed using Guava cytofluorimeter,
of EVs released by Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC treated MSCs
and by cells treated only with ADIBO-FITC, did not show any difference
between the two EV types (Figure 5B). In particular, both EVs expressed several exosomal
markers (Figure 5B)
such as CD81, CD9, CD107, and CD63, known to be present on EVs and
some mesenchymal stromal cells markers as CD73, CD44, and CD105, highly
expressed on MSCs (Figure 5C). Moreover, both EVs showed the presence of the adhesion
molecule CD29. It should be noted that MSC EVs enter into target cells
by a receptor-mediated mechanism through CD44 and CD29 molecules,
as previously demonstrated by Camussi et al.30 Therefore, the presence of these molecules at a comparable level
on EVs derived from Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC-treated MSCs
and from cells treated only with ADIBO-FITC implies the retention
of their excellent ability to enter into target cells.

Figure 6A shows
the fluorescence intensity of FITC analyzed by Guava cytofluorimeter
in unlabeled EVs derived from nontreated MSCs (control) compared with
EVs produced after MSCs treatment with ADIBO-FITC or with Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC. The last EVs population showed a higher fluorescence
intensity with respect to ADIBO-FITC-treated EVs, thus demonstrating
that the fluorescent dye introduced in the parent cells by the bio-orthogonal
approach translates to a highly specific labeling of EVs. The level
of different labeling of EVs was then also assessed by spectrofluorimetric
measurements of their suspensions treated with triton 0.1% in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (Figure 6B). It is important to outline that the advantage of the herein proposed
labeling protocol relies on the fact that the separation of unbound
fluorescent dye occurs immediately after the cell incubation step,
thus avoiding to carry out the ultracentrifugation of EVs in the presence
of an excess of unbound dye. The unbound dye, being often highly hydrophobic,
can form aggregates that can precipitate during the centrifugation
step thus raising to an unspecific fluorescence.

Ac4ManNAz. Fluorescence values were normalized to the total
EVs protein content determined by the Bradford assay. Data are the
mean ± SE of three different experiments. **p = 0.0067, Student t-test.

Tracking of Labeled EVs in MSCs Cells
Finally, to assess
whether the labeled EVs were still able to be uptaken into target
MSCs, a dedicated incorporation assay was performed. Target cells
were incubated for 1 h with EVs labeled as described above. Then,
the cells were washed and the presence of fluorescent EVs within cells
were evaluated by using a fluorescence microscope. As reported in Figure 7, EVs were clearly
incorporated in the target cells generating a detectable fluorescent
signal, definitely more intense in the case of Ac4ManNAz
and ADIBO-FITC containing EVs thus confirming the validity of this
labeling procedure based on the exploitation of a bio-orthogonal reaction.
In conclusion, in the present study, a rapid, biocompatible, and specific
chemical reaction between the FITC-functionalized cyclooctyne and
azido-sugars, previously produced on the cell surface by metabolic
glycoengineering, has been exploited to produce fluorescent exosomes.
This approach aims at the development of an advanced strategy for
direct and clean EVs labeling. The use of this labeling protocol can
also be adapted to label EVs surface with drugs or other imaging agents
that can be delivered to the pathological site, thanks to the specific
recruitment properties of these EVs. Moreover, this method may allow
the development of protocols for “in vivo” specific
labeling of target cells with Ac4ManNAz followed by ADIBO-dye/drug
administration and thus tracking biodistribution and drug delivery.

in the presence of EVs released by MSCs untreated (A,D), treated with
ADIBO-FITC (B,E) or Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC (C,F). Nuclei
were stained with DAPI (blue). FITC fluorescence (green) was evaluated
using an Apotome fluorescent microscope, magnification 20× (A–C)
and 40× (D–F).

Experimental Procedures
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar unless
otherwise stated and were used without further purification.

The synthesis of Ac4ManNAz and ADIBO-FITC was carried
out following literature procedures.31 Briefly,
Ac4ManNAz was synthesized by 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride and N-hydroxybenzotriazole mediated
amidation of d-mannosamine hydrochloride with azidoacetic
acid in methanol in the presence of triethylamine, followed by acetylation
of the hydroxyl groups with acetic anhydride. Final Ac4ManNAz was obtained after column chromatographic purification in
90% overall yield.

ADIBO-C6-NH2 was synthesized
starting from
dibenzosuberenone by treatment with hydroxylamine to obtain dibenzosuberenone-oxime
that was then rearranged to lactam by polyphosphoric acid-catalyzed
Beckman rearrangement. The lactam was then reduced with LiAlH4 to give dihydrodibenzoazocine which was then acylated with
6-(trifluoroacetamido)hexanoyl chloride. The alkyne was finally obtained
via a bromination-dehydrobromination procedure to give the amino-functionalized
aza-dibenzocyclooctyne (ADIBO-C6-NH2) after
saponification of the trifluoroacetamide moiety with K2CO3 in aqueous methanol. The product ADIBO-FITC was synthesized
by treating ADIBO-C6-NH2 with equimolar amounts
of fluorescein isothiocyanate in dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence
of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and finally purified by column chromatography.

Cell Labeling
Experiments
Human bone marrow MSCs were
purchased from Lonza and cultured and as previously described.32,33 MSCs derived from six preparations were used up to the seven passages
of culture. MSCs were grown in T75 flasks and when they reached 80%
confluence, they were incubated in the presence of 50 μM Ac4ManNAz (0.25 v/v % ethanol in MSC basal medium, Lonza) for
72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After the incubation, they
were washed three times with PBS and incubated for further 30′
at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the absence or in the presence
of 40 μM ADIBO-FITC (0.2 v/v % ethanol in MSC basal medium).
Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS, detached with 1
mM EDTA, resuspended in 250 μL of PBS and analyzed for their
FITC fluorescence and for mesenchymal stroma cell markers (CD 29,
CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD146) by FACS. FACS analyses were performed
immediately (day 0) or after 3 or 5 days post labeling using a BD
FASCalibur, (Franklin Lakes, NY, USA); nontreated MSCs were used as
control. Aliquots of the samples analyzed by FACS were exploited for
total cell protein determination by the Bradford assay and spectrofluorometric
analysis. Samples were sonicated in ice at 30% power for 30 s and
after proteins determination they were diluted 1:10 in triton 0.1%
in PBS and analyzed for their FITC fluorescence according to a FITC
calibration curve (ex 492 nm em 517 nm in the range 0.5–30
nM). The obtained nanomoles of FITC calculated for each cell samples
were normalized to milligrams of total cell proteins measured by Bradford
assays.

Immunofluorescence Experiment
Immunofluorescence analysis
of endocytic markers on MSCs treated with ADIBO-FITC with or without
Ac4ManNAz was performed on MSCs cultured on glass wells.
MSCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 2% sucrose and permeabilized
with HEPES–Triton X100 buffer (Sigma) immediately after the
labeling procedure. The following primary antibodies (Santa Cruz)
were used: EEA1 (sc-365652), Rab5 (sc-28570), Lamp-1 (sc-8098), Tia-1(sc-1751).
Omission of the primary antibodies was used as control. Alexa Fluor
596 anti-rabbit, or anti-goat or anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) were
used as secondary antibodies. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed
using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal model confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss International).
Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma) was added for nuclear staining.

MTT Assay
The MTT assay is based on the tetrazolium
salts reduction to formazan by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase,
which is quantified spectrophotometrically. MSCs cells previously
treated with 50 μM Ac4ManNAz for 72 h and 40 μM
ADIBO-FITC for 30′ were seeded at a density of 3 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well microtiter plate at 37 °C and
5% CO2 air atmosphere for 24 h. After this time, the medium
was removed and 100 μL of thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide
dissolved in medium at the concentration of 0.45 mg/mL was added into
each well and the plate was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5%
CO2. Then, the medium was removed, 150 μL of dimethyl
sulfoxide was added into each well to solubilize the formazan salt
crystals produced by the metabolism of live cells and the microplate
was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, absorbance
was read at 570 nm with iMark microplate reader (Biorad). Cell viability
was reported as percentage of death cells observed in treated samples
relative to that observed in not treated control cells. The experiment
was performed in triplicate, and the data were presented as mean ±
SD.

EVs Labeling Experiments
In agreement with the MSCs
labeling procedure described above, the EVs were produced from MSCs
cells pre-incubated with ADIBO-FITC in the presence or in the absence
of Ac4ManNAz. EVs were obtained from supernatants of MSCs
cultured overnight in RPMI deprived of FCS. Cell supernatant was centrifuged
at 3000g for 20 min to remove cell debris and apoptotic
bodies and subsequently was ultracentrifuged for 2 h at 100 000g (Beckman Coulter) as previously described.30

EVs Quantification
EVs were analyzed
by NTA, using
the NanoSight NS300 system (NanoSight Ltd, Amesbury, UK), equipped
with a 405 nm laser and a high sensitivity digital camera system (OrcaFlash2.8,
Hamamatsu C1 1440, Nanosight Ltd as previously described).33 For each sample, three videos of 30 s duration
were recorded. The settings of acquisition and analysis were optimized
and kept constant between samples. The final analysis reports the
mean, mode, and median vesicle size and an estimation of the concentration.

EVs Cytofluorimetric Analysis
Cytofluorimetric analysis
was performed using a Guava easyCyte flow cytometer (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) to detect EV fluorescence. In addition, the following PE-conjugated
antibodies were used to characterize EV surface markers: anti-CD81,
anti-CD9, anti-CD107, anti-CD63, anti-CD73, anti-CD44, anti-CD105,
and anti CD29 (all from Becton Dickinson). All experiments were analyzed
with InCyte software.

EVs Spectrofluorometric Analysis
EVs were lysated in
the presence of triton 0.1% in PBS and analyzed by spectrofluorimetry
(HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer, Edison, NY, USA).
The nanomoles of FITC calculated for each EV samples were normalized
to mg of total EVs proteins previously determined by the Bradford
assay. EVs derived from not treated MSCs were used as control in all
the performed studies.

Uptake of FITC-Labeled EVs on Target Cells
MSCs were
cultured onto glass dishes and when they reached 80% confluence, they
were incubated in the presence of 20 000 FITC-labeled EVs/cell
produced from MSCs pre-incubated with ADIBO-FITC in the presence or
in the absence of Ac4ManNAz. After 1 h of incubation at
37 °C 5% CO2, the cells were extensively washed with
PBS, they were fixed in PAF and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma).
Cells fluorescence was evaluated using an Apotome fluorescent microscope
(Zeiss), magnification 20× and 40×.
