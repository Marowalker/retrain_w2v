Bioconjugation
through oxime or hydrazone formation is a versatile
strategy for covalent labeling of biomolecules in vitro and in vivo.
In this work, a mass spectrometry-based method was developed for the
bioconjugation of small carbonyl compounds (CCs) with an aminoalkylhydrazine
to form stable hydrazone conjugates that are readily detectable with
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Out of all hydrazine
reagents tested, 2-(dimethylamino)ethylhydrazine (DMAEH) was selected
for further analysis due to the fastest reaction rates observed. A
thorough study of the reaction kinetics between structurally varied
short-chain CCs and DMAEH was performed with the second-order reaction
rate constants spanning in the range of 0.23–208 M–1 s–1. In general, small aldehydes reacted faster
than the corresponding ketones. Moreover, a successful reaction monitoring
of a deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase-catalyzed reversible retro–aldol
cleavage of deoxyribose was demonstrated. Thus, the developed method
shows potential also for ESI-MS-based enzyme kinetics studies.

Introduction
Various bioconjugation
reactions have become an essential route
to investigate the chemical and biological molecules in vitro and
in vivo.1 Hydrazone and oxime formations
are the examples of widely utilized covalent labeling reactions for
biomolecules under physiological conditions.2 These reactions are older than many other bioconjugation reactions
and have already been studied by German scientists in the late 1800s.3−6 In particular, hydrazines are commonly used as nucleophiles due
to their high reactivity toward carbonyl compounds (CCs), forming
stable hydrazone conjugates. Hydrazone conjugates are of great interest
due to their high specificity and bioorthogonality (i.e., potential
use in living systems without interfering with biological processes).1 The hydrazone formation follows a two-step mechanism:
first, an α-effect nucleophile (hydrazine) reacts with an electrophile
(aldehyde or ketone) to form a tetrahedral hemiaminal intermediate,
which then dehydrates to produce the final product (Figure 1).1 In general, the reaction is slow, especially at neutral pH; thus,
a general acid catalyst can be used to enhance the reaction rate.
The fastest rates are observed around pH ∼4.5, where carbonyl
carbon is protonated but hydrazine is not yet protonated. This limits
the use of hydrozone conjugation in in vivo applications where physiological
pH is desired. Another approach is to use nucleophilic catalysts such
as aromatic amines and phenols.7−9 However, many of these are toxic
to human cells; therefore, new types of nontoxic catalysts, like imidazoles
or bifunctional amines, have been proposed for cellular applications.10

R1, R2, and R3 are varying alkyl,
substituted alkyl, or aryl groups. Breakdown of the hemiaminal intermediate
is usually the rate-limiting step of the reaction.

Different CCs are widespread organic molecules in nature,
particularly
in environmental samples and food stuff, including milk products,
meat, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruits.11 Moreover, they can be used as preservatives in food processing,
brewery, and beverage industry due to their sensory nature.12 Certain aldehydes are produced during the process
of fermentation of alcoholic beverages13 and in high-temperature frying via degradation of fatty acids, lipids,
and proteins.14 Many of them are toxic
and potentially carcinogenic, especially formaldehyde,15,16 acetaldehyde,16 benzaldehyde,11,14 and furfural.13,17 For instance, according to the
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the daily reference dose
(RfD) of formaldehyde is about 0.2 mg kg–1 of body
weight.11 Thus, sensitive detection of
these compounds is an important task. However, sampling and detection
of short-chain CCs are challenging due to their low molecular weight
and high volatility. One way to overcome these challenges is to transform
CCs into the corresponding hydrazone or oxime conjugates, which improves
their chromatographic separation and detection sensitivity in conventional
GC–MS or LC–MS analysis.18,19 Most common
reagents used for this purpose are 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), o-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine (PFBHA),20 methoxyphenylhydrazine (MPH), and 4-hydrazinobenzoic
acid (HBA) (Figure 2). For example, DNPH has been successfully used for a simultaneous
detection of various aldehydes and ketones from cigarette smoke and
urine samples.21,22 PFBHA is one of the first synthesized
derivatization reagents to determine volatile carbonyl compounds present
in air samples23,24 or, e.g., uric acid in human
serum.25 Both are also chromophores, making
it possible to use UV–vis for their detection. The drawbacks
of DNPH and PFBHA are that they are electron-deficient α-nucleophiles
and perform relatively slowly at pH ≈7.1 Moreover, DNPH has a poor solubility in water, which hinders the
determination of some endogenous aldehydes like formaldehyde.26 Kool and co-workers have recently reported alternative
“fast α-nucleophiles”, which react much faster
at physiological pH and even without a catalyst.1,27,28 These compounds can be used for rapid bioconjugation
reactions of various biomolecules in vitro or in vivo.

for the bioconjugation of various carbonyl compounds.

In this study, a mass spectrometry based method was developed
for
the bioconjugation of small carbonyl compounds (CCs) with an aminoalkylhydrazine
to form stable hydrazone conjugates, which are readily detectable
with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Due to their
small size and high volatility, many CCs are difficult to detect directly
with ESI-MS or other atmospheric-pressure ionization (API) techniques.
Moreover, previous studies have relied on the chromophoric nature
of the formed hydrazone conjugates when utilizing UV–vis spectrophotometry
for detection.27,28 Thus, the ESI-MS-based method
should be more universal, as it can also be used to detect aliphatic
or alicyclic compounds without the need for chromophores in the structure.
Here, bioconjugation of four hydrazines and a hydroxylamine was performed
with a wide variety of small CCs (i.e., 9 aldehydes, 6 ketones, and
2 sugars) and 2-(dimethylamino)ethylhydrazine (DMAEH) was selected
for further analysis due to the fastest reaction rates observed in
the applied conditions. Moreover, a successful reaction monitoring
of a deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) catalyzed retro–aldol
reaction of d-deoxyrobise (DR) to form d-glyceraldehyde
and acetaldehyde was demonstrated, suggesting that the developed method
holds a vast potential also for ESI-MS-based enzyme kinetics studies.

Results
and Discussion
Bioconjugation of Short-Chain CCs for Detection
with ESI-MS
To compare the efficiency of different compounds
promoting hydrazone/oxime-based
bioconjugation of various CCs at neutral pH, we selected four hydrazines
(DNPH, MPH, HBA, and DMAEH) for initial reaction kinetics studies
(Figure 2). In the
previous study of Kool and co-workers, relative rate constants (krel) of DNPH, MPH, HBA, and DMAEH (at 25 °C
and pH 7.4) with 2-formylpyridine were determined to be 1.4, 2.0,
4.9, and 23, respectively. Additionally, PFBHA (hydroxylamine) was
included in our study since it is frequently used for the fast derivatization
of aldehydes for GC-MS detection.29

Among all hydrazine reagents tested, DMAEH was clearly the fastest
nucleophile as compared to three phenylhydrazines or hydroxylamine
(data not shown), consistent with the studies of Kool and co-workers.27,28 In addition, the terminal dimethylamino group present in DMAEH provides
a very high ionization efficiency in the positive-ion ESI, which is
beneficial for the detection of both free hydrazine (m/z 104.1181 for [DMAEH + H]+) and the
corresponding bioconjugate. Besides, DMAEH was fully converted into
specific hydrazone products with all CCs studied, except with a few
low-reactive ketones due to their less electrophilic nature (Figures S1–S3). In addition, not only
the small aldehydes and ketones but also the sugar molecules (DR and
DRP) reacted with DMAEH and yielded the corresponding conjugated products
(Figure S4). Thus, DMAEH was selected for
further reaction kinetics studies.

Reaction Kinetics Analysis
of CCs with DMAEH
A representative
ESI-MS-based reaction-monitoring analysis for the bioconjugation of
formaldehyde (FA) with DMAEH is presented in Figure 3. The reaction rate plots (ln R vs treact) at an increasing formaldehyde
concentration were sufficiently linear (R2 > 0.99), showing that the reactions in these conditions followed
a pseudo-first-order kinetics. Only at the highest aldehyde concentrations
tested (i.e., fastest rates), a slight deviation from linearity can
be seen. Therefore, we limited the reaction times generally to treact < 4000 s and/or the extent of the reaction
to ∼60% conversion (ln R > −1.0).
The second-order rate constant (obtained from the secondary plot, k1 vs [FA]) for formaldehyde was determined to
be k2 = 4.7 M–1 s–1, which is slightly higher than that observed for
2-formylpyridine in the previous study.28

ESI-MS. (b) Pseudo-first-order reaction rate plots at five different
formaldehyde concentrations. The concentration of DMAEH was always
10 μM. (c) Plot of the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant
(k1) as a function of formaldehyde concentration

Table 1 shows the
structures and the determined reaction rate constants (k2 and krel) for the other
investigated CCs with DMAEH at neutral pH by using ESI-MS (the reaction
rate plots can be found as Supporting Figures S5–S21). The slowest rate was observed with acetophenone
(k2 = 0.23 M–1 s–1; krel = 1) and the fastest
rate with pyruvaldehyde (k2 = 208 M–1 s–1; krel = 910.1). Pyruvaldehyde (also known as methylglyoxal) is a ketoaldehyde
that exists exclusively in its hydrated form in aqueous solution (Keq ≈ 8 × 103).30

Table 1 Second-Order (k2) and Relative (krel) Rate Constants
for Hydrazone Formation of Various Carbonyl Compounds (CCs) with 2-(Dimethylamino)ethylhydrazine
(DMAEH) at Neutral pH Determined with ESI-MSa
a Conditions used: The DMAEH concentration
was 5 μM for CCs 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 16; 10 μM for CCs
1–3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 17, and 18; 50 μM for CC 4; and 200
μM for CC 15. The relative second-order rate constants (krel) are relative to that of acetophenone (CC
15), which had the lowest k2 among all
the CCs studied (given krel = 1).

Some general trends can be observed
from the kinetics data presented
in Table 1. First,
aldehydes reacted faster than the corresponding methyl ketones. For
example, acetaldehyde (entry 2) had ∼2.6-fold higher rate than
acetone (11), butyraldehyde (5) had ∼3.9-fold higher rate than
2-pentanone (13), and isovaleraleraldehyde/valeraldehyde (7/8) had
∼2.5-fold higher rate than 2-hexanone (14). Also, benzaldehyde
(9) reacted much faster (17.6-fold) than acetophenone (15). Second,
the rates generally increased with increasing carbon chain length,
except for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which reacted faster than
propionaldehyde. In aqueous solution, formaldehyde exists exclusively
in its hydrated form (Keq ≈ 2000)
and acetaldehyde is partially hydrated (Keq ≈ 1); thus, it is possible that these two compounds may react
in hydrazone formation via an SN2-type substitution reaction
(Figure S22), which should have a lower
activation energy than nucleophilic addition, especially in the absence
of an acid catalyst and/or nonbulky substituents.

Kool et al. previously studied the reaction
rates of aliphatic
vs aromatic CCs and confirmed that simple aliphatic compounds react
more rapidly than aromatic ones, and that the steric effects are moderate
to small, except in case of very bulky aldehydes.27,28 It was concluded that electron-deficient CCs generally react faster
than electron-rich ones in hydrazone formation. This is in line with
our observations. However, there were some notable exceptions. Butanone
(12) had a 3.4-fold higher rate than propionaldehyde (3), which cannot
be explained by either electronic or steric effects. In addition,
lactaldehyde (4) reacted rather slowly (krel = 3.6) as compared to other aldehydes, although the hydroxyl group
present at the α-carbon should increase the reactivity. However,
lactaldehyde exists mainly in the dimeric form in aqueous solution,31 which may considerably decrease its reactivity.
The fastest rate observed for pyruvaldehyde (krel = 910.1) is probably because the compound has two adjacent
carbonyl groups, both of which can react in hydrazone formation with
a very little steric hindrance. Moreover, pyruvaldehyde also exists
mainly in its hydrated form in water,30 which may increase its reactivity via an SN2-type reaction
(Figure S23). In both cases, the hemiaminal
intermediate can be stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond.
In comparison, some aromatic dialdehydes have been reported to undergo
very rapid bioconjugation reactions with hydroxylamines by virtue
of a cyclic intermediate formed during the reaction.32 Due to the very rapid reactions in the applied conditions,
the rate constants for pyruvaldehyde were determined in the molar
excess of DMAEH rather than CC.

The trend in the observed rates
for ketones was not so clear. Unlike
aldehydes showing an increasing rate with an increasing carbon chain
length, aliphatic ketones did not show a clear dependence; 2-butanone
(12) reacted considerably faster (krel = 24.4) than acetone (11; krel = 4.6),
but 2-pentanone (13) and 3-pentanone (16) had very comparable rates
(krel = 6.6 and 6.1, respectively) to
that of acetone. The lower rate observed for 3-pentanone could be
explained by a greater steric hindrance (two ethyl groups) as compared
to the other aliphatic methyl ketones but not for 2-pentanone. Overall,
these results cannot simply be rationalized in terms of electronic
and steric effects, and more detailed studies are therefore needed.
The lowest rate among all CCs was observed for acetophenone (15; krel = 1), which can be explained by the disturbed
aryl conjugation upon the formation of a tetrahedral hemiaminal intermediate.27

Reactive carbonyl groups (aldehydes and/or
ketones) are naturally
present in many carbohydrates. Therefore, we tested whether DMAEH
can also be used for the bioconjugation of some simple sugar molecules.
Two monosaccharides, 2-deoxy-d-ribose (DR) and 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate (DRP), were evaluated in this context.
Both DR and DRP were converted into the corresponding hydrazone conjugates
within the extended reaction times, proving that the developed method
is equally good for detecting reactive sugar molecules. Interestingly,
DR had a comparable reaction rate (krel = 5.8) with the smallest aliphatic aldehydes but DRP had a roughly
7-fold higher rate than DR (krel = 41.3),
which suggests that the phosphate group present in the structure can
enhance the breakdown of the hemiaminal intermediate, which is believed
to be the rate-limiting step of the reaction. Figure 4 presents a bar plot to compare the relative
reaction rate constants of all CCs studied (Figure 4).

Hydrazone Formation of DERA Substrates and Products
Deoxyribose-5-phosphate
aldolase (DERA; E.C. 4.1.2.4) is an enzyme
that catalyzes the enantioselective formation of carbon–carbon
(C–C) bonds under mild reaction conditions.33,34 DERA has an important role in nucleic acid metabolism in bacteria
and attracted attention as a potential industrial biocatalyst for
the synthesis of pharmaceutically important intermediates. Naturally,
DERA catalyzes a retro–aldol cleavage of DRP into two aldehydes,
namely, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and acetaldehyde
(AA), as part of the pentose phosphate pathway. However, the reaction
is reversible and the reverse C–C bond formation in aldol reaction
has high potential in
synthetic chemistry. DERA also shows weaker activity in the cleavage
of DR.35 Consequently, DERA has been subjected
to biochemical engineering to tailor its activity, specificity, and
stability against high aldehyde concentrations.33 Since we observed efficient bioconjugation of both DR and
DRP with DMAEH, we further tested if the DERA-catalyzed C–C
bond cleavage of DR could be efficiently monitored by using the developed
ESI-MS-based method. Figure 5 shows a representative ESI-MS spectrum of the DMAEH bioconjugates
of the DERA-catalyzed retro–aldol reaction products of DR,
glyceraldehyde and acetaldehyde. Indeed, both the substrate and the
two aldehyde products can be efficiently detected directly from the
reaction mixture. The results indicate that the developed ESI-MS method
is suitable for the simultaneous detection and further quantitation
of substrates and products of enzyme-catalyzed reactions (here demonstrated
for the DERA enzyme) and also holds a vast potential for ESI-MS-based
enzyme kinetics assays, especially in the case of small molecules
that are difficult to detect with conventional API techniques.

retro–aldol reaction products of deoxyribose (m/z 220.1649), glyceraldehyde (m/z 176.1389), and acetaldehyde (m/z 130.1336). The unlabeled peaks are impurities
coming from the enzyme preparation. For details, see Experimental Section.

Conclusions
We have developed a bioconjugation method for
small carbonyl compounds
based on DMAEH to form the corresponding hydrazone conjugates. This
methodology allows successful measurements of small aldehydes, ketones,
or sugars by using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and can
be utilized in diverse applications such as measuring small volatile
organic compounds or following enzymatic reactions.

Conjugation
Reactions and Reaction Kinetic Analysis
The stock solutions
of hydrazines, DNPH, DMAEH, PFBHA, MPH, and HBA,
were prepared in water to the concentration of 2 mg mL–1. The stock solutions of CCs were prepared in methanol to 500 μM
concentration. The conjugation reactions were performed at room temperature
(23 ± 2 °C) by mixing appropriate aliquots of hydrazine
and CC stock solutions to obtain 5–200 μM hydrazine concentration
and a varying CC concentration. The reaction rates were measured under
pseudo-first-order conditions, i.e., excess amount of CC. All reactions
were performed in water/methanol (50:50, v/v) solvent mixture. The
MS data were collected at 5 min intervals, and the reaction time (treact) was calculated as the time between the
reagent mixing and the data acquisition. For each reaction, the intensities
of the free hydrazine (IH) and the corresponding
hydrazone conjugate (IHC) were tabulated
and the reaction rate constant (k1) was
determined as the slope of the primary linear fit to the integrated
rate equation ln R = −k1treact, where R = IH/(IH + IHC). It was presumed that the relative
ion intensities represent the true solution concentrations, [H] and
[HC], and that the reaction follows first-order kinetics. The latter
was proven by sufficient linearity (R2 > 0.99) observed for the primary linear fits. The second-order
rate
constant (k2) was then obtained from the
slope of the secondary linear fit k1 vs
[CC], which is essentially k2 = k1/[CC] at any concentration. All linear fittings
were performed with OriginPro 15.0 software (Origin Lab, Northampton,
MA). Finally, the relative second-order rate constants (krel) for different CCs were calculated as krel = k2,CC/k2,ref, where k2,ref is the
rate constant observed for acetophenone, which was the slowest among
the all CCs studied.

Enzyme Reaction
For the DERA-catalyzed
aldol reaction
to cleave DR (deoxyribose), 1 mL of substrate (6 mM) in 50 mM ammonium
acetate (pH 7.1) was mixed with 50.6 μL of DERA enzyme (1.1
mg mL–1 in 50 mM sodium phosphate solution). This
mixture was then incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After this,
10 μL of the reaction mixture was mixed with 100 μL of
methanol, which essentially quenches the enzymatic reaction, and then
90 μL of DMAEH (1 mM in water) was added and the mixture was
further incubated for 15 min before the analysis. The control experiment
was conducted in the absence of enzyme.

Mass Spectrometry
All experiments were performed using
a 12-T Bruker solariX XR Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
(FT-ICR) instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), coupled with
an Apollo-II ESI source. The samples were injected into the ion source
at a flow rate of 2 μL min–1 with dry nitrogen
serving as a nebulizing (4 L min–1) and drying gas
(80 °C, 1 bar). The ESI-generated positive ions were accumulated
for 0.08 s in the hexapole ion trap and subsequently transferred to
a dynamically harmonized ICR cell (Paracell) for trapping, excitation,
and detection. The ion flight time was set to 0.25 ms. One hundred
(1 M word) time-domain transients at m/z 40–1500 were summed for each spectrum, zero-filled once,
and full-sine apodized prior fast Fourier transform and magnitude
calculation. The mass spectra were externally calibrated using ESI-L
Tuning Mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The data acquisition
was performed using Bruker ftmsControl 2.1 software, and the data
postprocessing and analysis were accomplished with Bruker DataAnalysis
4.4 SR1 software.
