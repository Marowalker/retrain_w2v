Tomatoes (Solanum
lycopersicum)
are heavy nutrient feeding crops and require high amounts of nitrogen
to maximize fruit production. The type of nitrogen applied and timing
of fertilizer applications are important to reduce losses due to volatilization
and leaching. Previous research suggested that nitrogen stable isotopes
are a useful fingerprinting system for indicating if a crop has been
grown with synthetic or organic nitrogen applications. To study the
effects of fertilization systems on nitrogen isotopic patterns, “Better
Bush” tomatoes were grown in a 2 year greenhouse experiment
to analyze nitrogen isotopic composition, nitrogen content, and fruit
yield. Three main soil fertility treatments were evaluated, and the
results were compared to those obtained on plants grown in unfertilized
soil: conventional inorganic (synthetic Miracle Grow (MG)), organic
(bonemeal and bloodmeal (BB), BB with liquid Earth Juice (BBL), BB
with 25% vermicompost (VC), BBL with 25% VC, and 25% VC), and mixed
(MG with 25% VC). The soil fertilizers, treated and untreated soil,
immature and mature leaflets tomato fruit peels, and fruit juices
were analyzed for both nitrogen isotope ratios and nitrogen concentrations.
Plant δ15Nair decreased in the order organic
treatment-no fertilizer-mixed treatment-conventional treatment. The
average δ15Nair values in leaves, fruit
peels, and juice from plants grown with organic treatments ranged
from 4.5 to 11.9, 5.4 to 10.1, and 6.1 to 11.1‰, respectively,
whereas in the case of the inorganic treatment, the average δ15Nair values varied between −3.0 and 0.4,
−1.1 and 0.4, and −0.9 and 1.9‰, respectively.
Plant nitrogen concentrations in tomato decreased in the following
order (from highest to lowest): inorganic soil fertility treatment,
mixed treatments, and organic and control (no fertilizer) treatment.
The average weight %N values in leaves and fruit peels from plants
grown with organic treatments ranged from 1.3 to 4.2 and 1.1 to 2.3%,
respectively, whereas in the case of the inorganic treatment, the
average weight %N values varied between 3.7 and 5 and 1.3 and 2.8%,
respectively. Plants grown under organic treatments have higher δ15Nair, lower weight %N, and are enriched in 15N compared with the original soil than plants grown with
inorganic fertilizer, suggesting that the synthetic nitrogen sources
are more readily available for plant uptake than the organic ones.
The addition of vermicompost increases both δ15Nair and weight %N in plants. Tomato fruit yields did not differ
between cluster 1 and cluster 2 harvest, however, total tomato fruit
yields differed indicating that synthetically fertilized plants produced
the highest total yields (g) (P ≤ 0.05). However,
all treatments with VC soil applications indicated an increase in
the amount of plant nitrogen, fruit yield, soil cation exchange capacity,
soil organic matter content, and released soil nitrogen. Nitrogen
isotope ratios of tomatoes can be used to distinguish among various
soil fertility treatments, therefore fingerprinting the organic fertilizer
applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Many
aspects of vegetable production are similar among “organic”
or “conventional” systems, yet there are several important
differences, which are mostly related to fertility and pesticide management.1 Conventional agricultural systems rely on synthetic
chemical solutions, whereas sustainable or organic methods tend to
rely more on natural fertilizers and longer-term systems that are
considered more preventative than reactive.2 Nutrient management is crucial to both conventional and organic
crop production with nitrogen being the element that most limits plant
growth and causes yield reductions.3,4 Moreover, the
nitrogen fertilizer source and timing of applications are both important
to maximize crop yields and reduce nitrogen losses that occur through
volatilization and soil leaching.

One specific type of technique
for assessing nitrogen dynamics
includes measuring nitrogen isotope ratios in plants and other ecosystem
pools (i.e., the soil profile). Nitrogen isotope ratios have previously
proved useful because they reflect the total sum of fertilization
inputs, nitrogen outputs, and fractionation processes within the plant.5 However, previous literature suggested gaps when
studying the soil processes that control many key nitrogen transformations.
The 15N/14N ratios in soil ecosystems and corresponding
plant parts provide a useful tool to differentiate between plants
grown with various nitrogen fertilization methods.6,7

Plant isotope fractionation is a process that affects the relative
abundance of isotopes of the same element due to the preferential
uptake of the lighter and more abundant element, such as 14N, and it occurs during plant conversion of nitrogen compounds to
reduced forms.8 Mycorrhizal fungi are key
mediators of N flux and movement in the plant–soil system strongly
influencing isotopic patterns. These fungal interfaces provide heavy
feeding crops, like tomatoes, access to organic N forms. Assimilation
of N onto carbon skeletons has significant effects on plant productivity,
biomass, and resulting crop yields as nitrogen deficiency decreases
the photosynthetic capacity of the plant.9,10 Chemical
and biological processes often discriminate against 15N
in agricultural systems.11 However, mycorrhizal
fungi preferentially retain 15N and, as a consequence,
transfer 15N-depleted forms to plant hosts, allowing for
easier assimilation. These fungi also lower N losses in terrestrial
ecosystems during denitrification. Generally, organic nitrogen sources
have higher δ15Nair values, between 3.5
and 16.2‰, than those grown with inorganic or synthetic nitrogen
sources with values ranging between −4 and 4‰. Minimal
information is available with respect to integrated production systems
and their corresponding plant parts (i.e., the soils, plant leaves,
fruit peels, and juices). This information can be used to better understand
plant nitrogen usage, the denitrification process, plant–microbe
interactions, and enrichments or depletions form the soil system.
Nitrogen stable isotopes can also determine if a vegetable or fruit
product was grown in either an organic, conventional, or integrated
manner.6,12−14

A greater understanding
of nitrogen isotope ratios that develop
in plants is important because plant isotope discrimination reflects
the type of nitrogen applied to soil and soil microbe interactions
within cropping systems. These differences are essential to understand
plant nitrogen allocations to developed plant parts and better explain
how heavy nutrient feeding plants utilize all forms of nitrogen that
are available to them. Thus, the objective of this research was to
determine the influence of soil fertilization methods on the nitrogen
isotope composition of tomato leaves, fruit peels, and fruit juice,
as well as to corroborate the isotope data with the nitrogen content
of the mentioned plant parts and tomato fruit yields. To date, minimal
information is available on plant isotope discrimination from the
roots and shoots to leaves and fruit. Understanding plant isotope
discrimination can potentially help researchers to understand exactly
when a plant is assimilating N, which isotope of N (either 15N or 14N) the plant is uptaking, and where that nutrient
is moving within the plant system.

Results and Discussion
Soil Properties
The main characteristics of the soil
mixtures used for tomato plants growth are listed in Table 1. For the soil prepared in 2014,
the cation exchange capacity, pH, organic matter content, and nitrogen
release varied between 5.8 and 15.5 mequiv/100 g, 6.2 and 7.5, 2.0
and 6.4%, and 67.2 and 119.8 kg/ha, respectively. For the 2015 soil,
the same parameters ranged from 7.0 to 17.2 mequiv/100 mg, 4.9 to
7.7, 2.6 to 8.8%, and 109.8 to 177.0 kg/ha, respectively. The most
acidic soils were those treated in 2014 with Miracle Grow (MG) and
in 2015 the one treated with bonemeal and bloodmeal (BB). The addition
of vermicompost (VC) increased the cation exchange capacity, organic
matter content, and nitrogen release for each treatment.

Isotopes
In general, the organic soil
fertilizers have lower δ15Nair than the
inorganic ones (Table 2). Fertilizer δ15Nair varied from 3.7
(bloodmeal) to 18.6 ‰ (Earth Juice Grow). MG had a δ15Nair of 18.1‰. Nitrogen isotope data of
samples collected during both 2014 and 2015 revealed marked differences
among the soil–fertilizer treatments listed in Table 3. The nitrogen isotope composition
of sampled soil did not reflect that of the fertilizers used because
of the plant nitrogen uptake and microbiological activity that had
taken place prior to sampling.

In
the case of the 2014 experiment, the δ15Nair ranges in plants were 1.0 (MG) to 4.8‰ (BBL w/VC)
for soil, 0.4 (MG) to 8.3‰ (VC only) for the immature leaves,
−0.3 (MG) to 8.1‰ (VC only) for the mature leaves, 0.4
(MG) to 10.1‰ (VC only) for the cluster 1 skins, 0.3 (MG) to
9.2‰ (BBL w/VC) for the cluster 2 fruit skins, 1.9 (MG) to
11.1‰ (BB w/VC) for cluster 1 tomato juice, and 1.9 (MG) to
9.1‰ (VC only for cluster 2 tomato juice). For 2015, the δ15Nair ranges were −1.4 (MG) to 4.4‰
(BBL w/VC) for soil, −3.0.9 (MG) to 11.8‰ (VC only)
for the immature leaves, −0.9 (MG) to 8.1‰ (BB w/VC)
for the mature leaves, −1.1 (MG) to 9.4‰ (BB w/VC) for
the cluster 1 skins, 0.3 (MG) to 8.8‰ (VC only) for the cluster
2 fruit skins, −0.9 (MG) to 9.4‰ (BB w/VC) for cluster
1 tomato juice, and −0.8 (MG) to 8.0‰ (VC only) (Table 3). Generally, over
both growing seasons, plants grown using conventional inorganic soil
fertilizers displayed lower δ15Nair than
those grown under organic or mixed treatments. Furthermore, the addition
of VC resulted in an isotopic enrichment for all treatments and made
possible to distinguish the nitrogen isotope composition of the leaves
from plants grown in unfertilized soil from those leaves that developed
under organic fertilization. Vermicompost in soil enhanced the soil
organic matter content, therefore increasing the soil’s ability
to retain nutrients, leading to higher δ15Nair values.13,15 VC applications to the soil also increased
microbial activity. It is harder for living microbes to breakdown 15N-enriched organic matter into ammonium and nitrate because
this form of nitrogen is heavier with a slower vibrational energy.8 As the plants continued to mature into fruit
production, nitrogen uptake was maximized in the root and shoot assimilation.
Therefore, when VC was added to the other organic fertilizers, leaf
δ15Nair increased less at the mature than
at the immature one. Neither 14N nor 15N were
preferentially assimilated, and the plants utilized all forms of nitrogen
that were available in the soil.3 This
can also explain why no consistent temporal trends of leaf δ15Nair were present. Furthermore, the addition of
VC to the inorganic treatment brought closer the δ15Nair values of immature and mature leaves.

The tomato
fruit skins and juice was enriched in 15N
compared to leaves except when inorganic fertilizer was used. Overall,
plant δ15Nair decreased in the order organic
treatment-no fertilizer-mixed treatment-conventional treatment.

Nitrogen Fractionation and 15N/14N Ratios
The difference between the δ15Nair values
of tomato leaves and fruit skin and juice and those of the soil that
was collected together with the immature leaves can be seen as a measure
of isotopic enrichment/depletion during plant maturation and proved
useful in distinguishing among the different soil treatments present
in Table 4. Plant–soil
δ15Nair difference varied in 2014 between
−2.9 (mixed fertilization; MG with VC) and 4.4‰ (organic
fertilization; BB and BBL) for leaves, −3 (mixed fertilization;
MG with VC) and 5.8‰ (organic fertilization; BB) for peels,
and −1.1 (mixed fertilization; MG with VC) and 5.7‰
(VC only) for juice. For the 2015 growing season, the same difference
varied between −1.0 (mixed fertilization; MG with VC) and 9.5
(control no fertilizer) in leaves, −3.3 (mixed fertilization;
MG with VC) to 8.5‰ (control no fertilizer) in peels, and −2.8
(mixed fertilization; MG with VC) and 6.4‰ (organic fertilization;
BBL). Plants fertilized with only conventional inorganic fertilizers
did not fractionate during uptake as δ15Nair values were close to 0.0‰, in both 2014 and 2015 immature
and mature tomato leaflets. Positive discrimination occurs when 14N is incorporated more readily than 15N, causing
the δ15Nair of the plant to be less than
the δ15Nair of the nitrogen source. This
isotopic fractionation during plant growth occurs because nitrate-reductase
and glutamine-synthetase both discriminate against 15N
during assimilation, which causes an influx of nitrate, with the lower
δ15Nair values on the conventionally fertilized
plants. Moreover, the lack of discrimination resulting from the conventionally
fertilized tomatoes suggests that fractionation does not occur with
high influxes of nitrogen due to high-affinity transport mechanisms
of both ammonium and nitrate.3 Plants supplied
with organic fertilizer sources had higher δ15Nair values compared to those of the conventionally fertilized
tomatoes. At the fruit expansion and mature leaf stages, 15N values were higher in plant parts than in the soils for the organic
fertilization treatments, whereas the conventional fertilization treatments
had low 15N values in plant parts.11

The use of conventional
inorganic fertilizers led to the lowest
enrichment and even depletion in plants. This suggests that nitrogen
was easily available from the soil source. Ammonium and nitrate are
nitrogen forms found in Miracle Grow, and this synthetic fertilizer
is readily soluble in water and easier for plant uptake compared with
organic nitrogen sources. In comparison, the addition of VC resulted
in depletion only for the inorganic treatments. Organically fertilized
tomatoes had higher δ15Nair values than
the soil. This suggests that both mineralization and biological transformations
were occurring in the soil system and were the main reasons for an
increase in the nitrogen isotopic values.11

The organic treatments indicated differences in isotopic abundance
between the various fertilization treatments and their corresponding
plant growth stages. The organic and mixed fertilizer applications
with VC had the highest δ15Nair values
in the leaf, peel, and juice samples. In contrast, the organic treatments
with only rock fertilizers (i.e., bonemeal and bloodmeal) indicated
slightly lower δ15Nair values. Since VC
applications to the soil increase organic matter content, they also
increase microbial activity. However, VC also enriches the 15N isotopic abundance in the soil profile. Due to this increase, it
is harder for living microbes to breakdown organic matter into ammonium
and nitrate because this form of nitrogen has a slower vibrational
energy.8 As the plants continued to mature
into fruit production, nitrogen uptake was maximized in the root and
shoot assimilation. Thus, there is a slight decrease in δ15Nair abundance in all organic treatments because
neither 14N nor 15N were preferentially assimilated
and the plants utilized all forms of nitrogen that were available
in the soil.3

The nitrogen isotope
patterns in the plants grown under the conventional
inorganic, mixed, and organic soil fertility treatments are explained
by the type and availability of nitrogen, also by the changes in the
physicochemical characteristics that occur when organic fertilizers
and especially vermicompost are added. The synthetic and readily available
MG-containing NH4+ is immediately assimilated
in the roots through a single assimilation event. In contrast, NO3– assimilation occurs in the roots and shoots
via two-assimilation events.3,16 The average isotopic
composition of ammonia fluctuates between −42.4 and 7.1‰
and for nitrate from −2 to 3‰.15,17−19 The availability of both nitrogen sources led to
a preferential incorporation of 14N, which was amplified
by the addition of soil-improving VC. This explains why the plants
grown under the conventional inorganic soil treatment displayed the
lowest δ15Nair values. However, in 2014,
plants fertilized with MG indicated an increase in δ15Nair content only in fruit juices. The majority of beneficial
nutrients found in tomatoes are concentrated in the tomato flesh and
juice, which may explain the increase in nitrogen isotopic abundance
as compared to that in the leaflets and fruit peel. This increase
in 15N is also due to preferential uptake of 14N during plant growth and maturation. The heavier nitrogen isotope
remained in the soil and was assimilated during the fruit ripening
stages.8,17

Despite the increased cation exchange
capacity, organic matter
content, and nitrogen release of the soils fertilized with organic
mixtures, it is probable that nitrogen was not so readily available
to plants. Moreover, there could have been a competition for the many
nitrogen sources. Therefore, as the plant matured, different parts
become enriched in 15N compared with the supporting soil.
Applying nitrogen fertilizer to soil changes the abundance of 15N/14N ratios in plant parts, as reported previously.11

Nitrogen Content
The weight percent
nitrogen (wt %N)
values obtained in soils, tomato plant leaves, and fruit peels were
influenced by fertilizer treatments in 2014 and 2015 (Table 5). In 2014, soil was lowest
in wt %N compared with plant material and soil values ranged from
0.1 (MG) to 0.4% (BB w/VC). For the immature and mature leaves, nitrogen
content ranged from 1.1 (no fertilization) to 4.2% (MG w/VC). For
cluster 1 tomato peel, nitrogen content ranged from 1.5 (no fertilization)
to 2.0% (BB) and for cluster 2 peel, from 1.5 (no fertilization) to
1.9% (BB). In 2015, the soil wt %N was again lower than all other
plant parts and ranged from 0.02 (no fertilization) to 0.66% (VC only).
For immature leaves, nitrogen content ranged from 1.5 (VC only) to
4.2% (MG w/VC). Similarly, mature leaf nitrogen content was between
1.9 (no fertilization) and 4.8 wt %N (MG w/VC). Cluster 1 peel had
values between 1.5 (no fertilization) and 2.8% (MG only), and similarly
cluster 2 peel values were between 1.2 (VC only) and 2.8% (MG only).
Over both growing seasons, the soil nitrogen values were lower than
plant parts. The synthetically fertilized treatments with MG and MG
w/VC had the highest wt %N values.

Tomato Fruit
Yield
Tomato yield parameters were influenced
by the various fertilization treatments listed in Table 6. In 2014, our results indicated
that there were no differences in tomato yields for both cluster 1
and cluster 2. However, total tomato yields differed between treatments
with the conventionally fertilized tomatoes (MG and MG w/VC) having
higher fruit weights compared with all other fertilization treatments.
In 2015, tomato fruit parameters were also influenced by fertilizer
treatments. Differences in fruit yield were apparent in cluster 1,
with mixed nitrogen fertilization sources (BB w/VC, BBL w/VC, and
MG w/VC) having the highest tomato fruit weight compared with all
other treatments; however, no differences were seen in cluster 2.
Total tomato yields were also influenced by fertilization treatment,
with conventional inorganic fertilizers (MG and MG w/VC) having highest
total yield weights compared with all other treatments.

a Mean weight of
tomato fruit yields
represented in gram for each of eight soil fertilization treatments.

Tomatoes are considered high-value
horticultural crops as they
can generate great revenue in comparison to many other vegetables.20 Optimizing fruit yields in both organic and
conventional growing systems is important in tomato production. Thus,
the results of our study compared the differences found in the 15N/14N ratios based upon fertilization treatment
and how this translated to plant growth and fruit yields. Few differences
were seen in cluster 1 and cluster 2 fruit yields for both 2014 and
2015 (Table 6). During
early plant growth and initial mineral uptake, immature plants photosynthesize
less and uptake nutrients similarly in both conventionally and organically
fertilized soils.21 As the plants continued
to mature, differences were detected in total fruit yields between
the conventionally and organically fertilized plants and generally
indicated that tomatoes fertilized with conventional inorganic sources
indicated greater fruit yields. Organic production by use of manures
(e.g., vermicompost) can be difficult to manage due to variability
in nutrient concentrations and mineralization release.20,21 Organic fertilizers applied to the soil take time to breakdown and
N sources are more difficult for plant uptake due to enrichments of
δ15Nair remaining in the soil, which related
to a slight decrease in fruit.22,23 In comparison, conventionally
fertilized soils with ammonium and nitrate tend to have a more consistent
supply of nitrogen throughout the production.24

Nitrogen Assimilation
The differences in yields and
isotopic abundance result from where the various assimilates are moving
in the tomato plant. Tomato crop yield and productivity is related
to assimilation processes and source to sink capacities. Under normal
conditions, assimilate availability (source capacity) is lower than
assimilate demand (sink capacity) and fruit growth is source limited.24 Leaf photosynthetic capacity can also strongly
depend on source to sink balance, as well as the types of nitrogen
fertilizers utilized during crop production. Nitrogen availability
is an important factor that may limit source-sink assimilates.25 For example, when conventional inorganic nitrogen
was applied, tomato roots had sufficient nitrogen conditions and increased
N uptake sufficiently to the shoots. This availability of 14N maximized tomato photosynthetic capacity and increased fruit yields.
However, in the organic fertilization treatments heavier in 15N, both the roots and shoots expanded photosynthetic energy to uptake
N assimilates, decreasing source capacities and lowering fruit yields.26 Tomato plants also indicated thrips during both
growing seasons. This damage may have interfered with tomato production,
leading to lower yield weights. Tomatoes also indicated necrosis and
chlorosis half-way through fruit production. This discoloration could
have been from disease or nutrient deficiency and also may have resulted
in lower fruit production and yields. However, these growing discrepancies
would not change the nitrogen isotopic composition due to root and
shoot assimilation events that have been previously discussed.16

Conclusions
This research indicates
that plant nitrogen isotope analyses can
provide useful intelligence to detect differences between organically
and conventionally fertilized tomatoes. When various forms of nitrogen
are applied to the soil, the method of nitrogen uptake differs between
conventional and organic production systems and this also leads to
differences in plant enrichment and depletion from the soil source.
Moreover, the applications of various nitrogen sources change the
water holding capacity of the soil system, which is reflected in tomato
foliage and fruit isotopic compositions. By utilizing systems that
are more sustainable and environmentally friendly, we can help build
soil structure and organic matter, which will lead to a decrease in
nitrogen applications and potential environmental pollution. With
a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in nitrogen uptake
from various production systems, we can potentially maximize plant
productivity and profitability, leading to an increased economic gain
while reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs.

Organic certification
agencies are highly interested in whether
vegetable products such as tomato have been grown using organic or
inorganic origins; plant δ15Nair values
have the potential to be utilized in this process. Organic growers
producing over U.S. $5000 gross income a year must go through organic
certification processes, and there are several rules that farmers
must implement regarding fertilization and pesticide usage.27 Stable isotope analyses could be utilized during
the certification process to determine if crops have been grown using
the correct nitrogen fertilizers. We suggest that mature tomato leaflets
are best suited for sampling nitrogen isotope analyses because at
the mature growth stages, plants are maximizing nutrient uptake and
photosynthetic capacity. Thus, on the basis of results of this study,
nitrogen stable isotope patterns in mature tomato plants can indicate
whether a crop has been fertilized by organic or inorganic methods.

Materials
and Methods
A greenhouse experiment was set up in a randomized
complete block
design with three replications and eight tomatoes per replication.
Tomatoes were fertilized with the same fertilizer applications repeated
for two growing seasons. The experiment was conducted from 10 July
to 15 Dec 2014 and 11 July to 11 Dec 2015 at the Horticulture Research
Center Greenhouse at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois.
“Better Bush” tomatoes (Tomato Growers Supply Company,
Fort Meyers, FL) were grown from seed in 8 L plastic pots filled with
1:1:1 steamed-sterilized Belknap silt loam/sand/peat mix. During both
growing seasons, the average temperature of the greenhouse fluctuated
between 13 and 36 °C and the plants received only natural sunlight.
Three main soil fertility treatments were studied, and the results
were compared with those obtained on plants grown in unfertilized
soil: conventional inorganic, organic, and mixed. The inorganic fertilization
treatment applied synthetic Miracle Grow (24.0N-3.5P-13.3K, Scotts,
Marysville, OH) (MG) to soil in addition to all-purpose 12-12-12 fertilizer
(12.0N-5.2P-10.0K). The average percentage of ammonia found in Miracle
Grow is monabasic ammonia phosphate at 11% and nitrate is found at
17%. The organic treatments made use of the following: (1) organic
bonemeal (6.0N-3.9P-0.0K, Whitney Farms, Independence, OR) and bloodmeal
(12.0N-0.0P-0.0K, Whitney Farms, Independence, OR) (BB), (2) organic
BB with liquid Earth Juice Grow (2.0N-0.5P-0.8K, Hydro-Organics, Chico,
CA) and liquid Earth Juice Bloom (0.0N-1.4P-0.8K, Hydro-Organics,
Chico, CA) (BBL), (3) organic BB with 25% vermicompost (VC), (4) organic
BBL with 25% VC, and (5) 25% VC only. The mixed treatment consisted
in the application of MG with 25% VC. In addition, potassium sulfate
was added to the organic treatments. For each growing season, a new
batch of steamed soil was used prior to being mixed with fertilizers.

The soil–fertilizer mixtures were prepared using a cement
mixer and placed into plastic pots. The vermicompost was developed
using red wiggler earthworms (Eisenia fetida) feeding on coffee grounds and vegetable wastes. The rock fertilizers
(e.g., bonemeal, bloodmeal, and potassium sulfate) and vermicompost
were added separately prior to tomato planting. Each homogenized soil
mixture was analyzed for pH, cation exchange capacity, organic matter
content, and nitrogen release (Table 1). The pots were watered for 7–10 days to induce
volunteer vegetable seedlings from the vermicompost, which were then
hand-weeded prior to sowing of tomato seeds. At seeding, three tomato
seeds were covered with about 0.5 cm of soil and watered daily. At
the four-leaf stage, tomato plants were thinned to one plant per pot.
The pots were watered once or twice daily, and the tomato plants were
pruned and topped to one main stem with several side shoots and trellised
onto bamboo stakes once the plants were 0.5 m tall.

Sample Collection
Tomato leaves were collected at two
growth stages (immature leaflets harvested in Sept and mature leaflets
harvested in Oct), and fruits were collected from the first two fruit
clusters at the red-ripe stage in Nov 2014 and Dec 2015. Five tomato
leaflets were harvested from each plant and were collected from the
tip, middle, and closest to the stem of the topmost branch (branch
1) and from only the very tip of the next two lower branches (branches
two and three). Soil samples were taken concomitant with the immature
plant leaves at a depth of 5–7 cm where the average temperature
was 22 °C and from an area with no root material.

Tomato
harvest began on 12 Oct 2014 and 8 Oct 2015. Tomatoes were harvested
at the red-ripe stage with harvest completed on 28 Nov 2014 and 1
Dec 2015. Two marketable tomatoes were harvested from clusters 1 and
2 and were placed into separately labeled paper bags to decrease chances
of contamination and brought to the laboratory for sample preparation.
The yield weight (g) of each tomato was taken at the time of harvest.
However, two treatments did not produce cluster 2 tomatoes due to
small amounts of N fertilizer applied to the soil media (e.g., no
fertilization and BB).

Sample Preparation for Nitrogen Stable Isotope
Analyses
The fertilizers utilized in this study were analyzed
for isotopic
composition. The fertilizers and VC were oven dried for 2–3
days at 70 °C, ground to a fine powder, and dried for another
1 day longer (Table 2). All collected leaf samples were oven dried for 1–2 days
at 75 °C, ground to a fine powder with mortar and pestle, and
further dried for 1–2 days at 75 °C.28 Between 1.5 and 1.9 mg of each leaf sample were packed
into a Costech Analytical 3.5 × 5 mm2 tin capsule.
Soil samples were oven dried for 3–4 days at 70 °C, ground
to a powder, and oven dried again for another 1–2 days at 70
°C. The ground soil samples (1–1.5 mg) were packed into
tin capsules, as described previously. Tomatoes were prepared by making
a circular incision 3–5 cm in diameter about 0.5 cm deep into
the tomato peel with scapula and blade. The tomato peel was removed
from each fruit and immediately oven dried for 3–4 days at
75 °C. The samples were ground into a fine powder and oven dried
for an additional 1–2 days. For each peel sample, 1.5–2
mg was packed into a tin capsule. The peeled tomatoes were placed
into large beakers and ground into juice with a large pestle. After
macerating the tomatoes, roughly 35–40 g were placed into large
test tubes and centrifuged at 3951g-force for 5 min
to obtain the supernatant (tomato juice) on a Thermo Scientific Sorvall
ST 16 centrifuge. The resulting juice was filtered through Sterlitech
micropore filters and immediately frozen at roughly −18 °C.
Just prior to packing in tin capsules, tomato juice samples were thawed,
and approximately 0.4 mL dropped with a syringe on 20 mg of inert
Sigma-Aldrich silicon dioxide powder placed into a 5 × 9 mm2 tin capsule.

Elemental Combustion-Continuous Flow-Isotope
Ratio Mass Spectrometer
(IRMS)
All packed samples (fertilizer, tomato leaf, fruit
peel, fruit juice, and soil) were combusted in a Costech 4010 elemental
combustion system. The temperatures of the combustion/oxidation tube,
which contained chromium oxide as oxidation catalyst, reduction tube,
which contained reduced copper wire for the removal of excess oxygen,
and gas chromatography column, which was used to separate the N2 from CO2 gas, were 1020, 680, and 57 °C,
respectively. The gases were carried in an ultrapure He stream, passed
through a magnesium perchlorate water trap, and entered into a DELTA
V Plus IRMS, where the nitrogen isotope ratios were measured, via
a ConFlo IV unit, both from Thermo Scientific.

The nitrogen
isotopic ratios (15N/14N ratio) were expressed
as  Rstandard is the
ratio of the heavy isotope to the light isotope in the standard, and Rsample is the ratio of the heavy isotope to
the light isotope in the sample. δ is reported on the basis
of the intensities of ion signals measured in the IRMS and provides
a means of expressing the small changes in isotopic ratios between
specific samples and standards.8

Both δ15Nair and weight %N were determined.
δ13CVPDB data was collected but is not
presented. USGS 40 and 41 (l-glutamic acid) were used as
bracketing certified standards for nitrogen isotopes; analytical precision
for δ15Nair was ±0.07‰. Acetanilide
was used as a certified standard to calculate weight %N; analytical
precision was ±0.15% for wt %N.

Statistical Analysis
Data were processed statistically
and expressed as the isotopic means ± standard deviation (SD),
wt %N means ± standard deviation (SD), and tomato yield means
(g) ± standard deviation (SD). To study the differences among
sample groups, the data was processed using a two-tailed analysis
of variance (JMP Statistical Discovery Software, JMP, 2014 and 2015
Cary, NC). The least significant difference (LSD) and Student’s t multiple range tests were used to separate fertilizer
treatment means at P ≤ 0.05. Orthogonal contrast
was used to compare the treatments with vermicompost from those without
any (SAS: Analytics, Business Intelligence and Data management, SAS,
2014, Cary NC).
