We
describe a versatile cascade route for manufacturing MQ resins
using alkoxysilanes (e.g., tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)) or equivalent
oligomers (e.g., ethyl polysilicate (polyTEOS)), a carboxylic acid
(typically acetic acid), and hexamethyldisiloxane (MM) as starting
materials; a strong acid catalyst is also employed in the one-pot
reaction. The siloxane resin synthesis is accompanied by esterification
of the carboxylic acid to give ethyl acetate, which acts as an important
solvent, making the process more controllable. Contrary to traditional
sol–gel methods, no water is introduced in the experiments,
but is generated in situ. The strategy offers several advantages,
including reproducibility, high yields of siloxane resins with excellent
batch-to-batch consistency and without gel formation, narrow dispersity,
low Si-hydroxyl residues in the final products, and the ability of
increasing the molecular weight by thermal treatment. The process
utilizes the green chemistry concepts of lower pollutant formation
and higher atom efficiency.

==== Body
Introduction
MQ resins (M = Me3SiO1/2, Q = SiO4/2) are attracting increasing attention because
of their excellent
heat resistance, flexibility over an extremely wide temperature range,
film-forming properties, water resistance, and ability of acting as
performance modifiers. Therefore, they are utilized in a broad range
of applications including liquid silicone rubber, pressure-sensitive
adhesive, light-emitting diode encapsulation, electronics, personal
care, nanomaterials, and so on.1 MQ resins
have been interested increasingly by the silicone industrial community
and were rediscovered by academics in the report of Flagg and McCarthy
in 2016.2

Traditionally, the synthesis
of siloxane resins involves hydrolysis/condensation
processes that were invented and patented by Hyde3 for silsesquioxanes and by Daudt and Tyler for MQ resins
(Figure 1).4 These processes and the properties of silsesquioxanes
were reviewed by Baney et al.5 There are
several disadvantages associated with traditional hydrolysis/condensation
synthetic processes using chlorosilanes or organoalkoxysilanes as
starting materials. Most problematically, the reactions occur too
rapidly to permit effective control, and the formation of gels or
insoluble white powders is a common outcome.

Figure 1 Traditional hydrolysis/condensation
processes used to create MQ
resins.

One modified strategy to avoid
this problem, in part, involves
a slower and more controlled hydrolysis typically carried out in an
organic solvent/water biphase system capable of dissolving chlorosilanes
and/or siloxane oligomers; commonly used solvents include aromatics
and chlorinated hydrocarbons. The product of the process is a dispersion
of SiOH-rich siloxane resins. Even when the reaction temperature is
well controlled carefully, these processes are still associated with
challenges in terms of process complexity, including the need for
solvent extraction, separation, and purification. Batch inconsistency,
broad molecular weight (Mw) dispersity,
formation of gels, and low yields are often associated with the process.2 At a commercial level, the manufacture of MQ
resins is associated with the need to responsibly dispose of large
amounts of wastewater containing acids, salts, alcohol, and organic
solvents to meet environmental regulations. To address many of the
problems listed above, we have investigated a cascade esterification
route to MQ resins based on silane reagents.

Sumrell and Ham
showed that SiCl4 catalyzed the esterification
of carboxylic acids with alkylorthosilicates (alkyl = methyl, ethyl,
and isopropyl). Although they were not concerned with the end state
of the silicon compounds, the method shows precedent for this work.6 HCl is presumably the active acid catalyst. Milder
acids are also effectively employed in the siloxane resin formation.
Eisenberg et al. reported silsesquioxanes derived from formic acid
and functional methoxysilanes, without acid catalyst; polycondensation
was performed for a period of time from 2 days to 1 month.7 In an analogous process, Egorova et al. investigated
in detail the mechanism and kinetics of the polycondensation of dimethoxydimethylsilane
with excess anhydrous deuterated acetic acid (CD3COOD)
as an active medium. They demonstrated that, in the absence of strong
acids, esterification is the slowest step of the multistep process
that leads to siloxanes, in this case, linear dimethylsilicone fluids.8 This process can be used to synthesize MQ copolymers,
as reported by Vasil’ev et al., product formation using tetraethoxysilane
(TEOS) ((SiOEt)4), trimethylmethoxysilane, and a large
excess of acetic acid required 35 h at reflux with toluene as the
solvent.9

The rates of both transesterification
and polysiloxane formation
are accelerated when both weak and strong Brønsted acids are
present in the reaction medium. Ivanova et al. reported that partial
polycondensation of RSi(OMe)3 (R = C6H5, CH3) to give polycyclic structures with branched fragments,
accompanied by transesterification, was rapid in the presence of HCl
and an excess of acetic acid. The reaction has an induction period
that could be substantially shortened by the addition of HCl or methanol.10

These studies and related work by Muzafarov
demonstrated that siloxane
bond formation can be elicited by acidic transesterification processes.11 As noted, the reaction is slow in the absence
of strong acids. The above processes described typically utilized
excess acetic acid as an active medium. These reactions have failed
to find their industrial value and applications because of the inefficiencies,
slow reaction times, and, especially in manufacturing processes, the
difficulty in eliminating excess, corrosive acetic acid.

Results
We report that a one-pot cascade esterification reaction of either
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) or its partially hydrolyzed product, polyTEOS,
at reflux using only stoichiometric quantities of carboxylic acid
with respect to OEt groups, Me3SiOSiMe3 (MM)
as the “M” reagent rather than an alkoxytrimethylsilane,
and in the presence of a strong acid significantly enhances the efficiency
and utility of the process for MQ resin synthesis (Figure 2). We judge efficiency by considering
ease of isolation, product yield, and product constitution, including
molecular weight and the dispersity (ĐM) of the MQ resin by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).

Figure 2 Cascade
esterification process for siloxane resin formation.

Initial experiments were undertaken with Si(OEt)4 to
facilitate an understanding of the MQ synthesis process. Siloxane
resins were synthesized concomitant with esterification of the carboxylic
acid, generally using ∼1 equiv of acetic acid/OEt group (Table 1). The results were
compared to those obtained by traditional hydrolysis (Table 2). The generated “byproduct”—ethyl
acetate—acted as a solvent such that the reaction is homogeneous
throughout the reaction process. An exotherm was observed once the
strong acidic catalyst was added (Figure 3). Siloxane resin products were obtained
simply via neutralization, typically using Na2CO3 (aq), separation by filtration, and distillation of the ethyl acetate
coproduct from the siloxane product. The process was completed by
gentle heating to remove residual solvent.

A variety of strong acidic catalysts was tested, including
strong
acids such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, 98% sulfuric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and some other acidic substances,
including Lewis acid (FeCl3, AlCl3, SnCl2), acetyl chloride, trimethylchlorosilane, and tetrachlorosilane
(Tables 3 and 4). Although the most effective
catalyst was triflic acid based on the (small) amount required, a
unimodal GPC curve (Figure 4), an enhanced rate of reaction, and the lowest SiOH concentration
(see below), the best balance of performance and cost was provided
by sulfuric acid; similar products were observed (1 vs 2, Tables 1 and 3). Use of 98% H2SO4 at 2 wt % was found
to balance the speed and efficiency of the reaction (Table 4).

Having demonstrated the key characteristics of the
reaction with
TEOS, analogous reactions were examined with its hydrolyzate, which
comprises partly condensed TEOS (Q-oligomers, with one-half the OEt
groups), requiring less acetic acid and producing less ethyl acetate;
safety issues associated with TEOS are avoided. In addition, longer
reaction times led to higher Mw products,
but with accompanying higher dispersities. Otherwise, compared to
TEOS, it was found that very similar reaction outcomes could be observed
(9 vs 10; Tables 1 and 5). Surprisingly, small changes in the acid concentration
and drying protocol can lead to increases in Mw of the products, but little change in dispersity (Tables 4 and 6; Figure 5).
Reaction times of about 4 h were optimal (Table 7).

An approximately stoichiometric amount
of acetic acid (CH3COOH/OEt = 1.1:1 or less) was used in
the described manufacturing
route, which is a key distinction from previous research. The absence
of excess acetic acid or water reduces the technical challenges and
costs of workup, as the “byproduct” of the reaction
is primarily ethyl acetate. An analysis of the distillate fraction
by gas chromatography (GC) showed that MM was completely consumed
in the reaction, which means that all MM is converted into MQ copolymers
(Figure 6). This is
too beneficial, as the distilled ethyl acetate stream is not contaminated
by MM.

Figure 6 GC analysis showing no MM in the MQ resin product.

Characterization of the product MQ resins showed
them to be quite
different from products of hydrolysis (5–7 vs 11, Table 1). In particular,
there was less residual SiOH (or SiOEt) in the resins produced by
this cascade esterification, as shown by infrared analysis. Preliminary
studies showed that the Si–OH concentration could be further
reduced by gentle heating. For example, the low concentration of SiOH
groups apparent from the signal near 3450 cm–1 after
drying at 60 °C for 3 h had nearly disappeared if instead the
drying temperature was 120 °C for 3 h (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Infrared analysis of (A) MQ resin produced by
hydrolysis and produced
by the described method using TfOH as the catalyst; (B) a polyTEOS-derived
resin dried under vacuum at low temperature (60 °C) or higher
temperature (120 °C) for 3 h.

A second difference found with products from this process
involved
the molecular weight distributions. Lower M/Q ratios, unsurprisingly,
led to higher Mw materials (5–7, Tables 1 and 8). Samples dried at 60 °C exhibited a nearly unimodal
distribution with ĐM near 1.4. By
contrast, samples heated at 120 °C for 3 h showed a bimodal weight
distribution almost without Si–OH residues but with a wider
bimodal peak and ĐM of 1.6–1.8
(Table 6). Thus, practically,
one can tune residual SiOH and Mw profiles
by the time/temperature of postreaction heat cure treatment.

The process showed
excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility and
consistency. Repetitions using sulfuric acid as the catalyst led to
MQ resins with consistent yields and with almost the same molecular
weight and ĐM (Table 9).

One common manifestation of the differences in MQ

ability of adding tack to polymer elastomers or gels.12 A comparison with a commercial MQ resin showed distinct
differences in tack provided at the same loading (Table 10).Table 10 Effect

Discussion
The Fischer esterification of an alcohol with
a carboxylic acid
is a time-honored, reliable route to esters (Figure 2A). The efficiency of the process relies
on a strong acid catalyst and a mechanism to distort the equilibrium
to favor products. The use of excess alcohol or carboxylic acid can
satisfy the latter requirement, but of course dehydration by distillation
or by physical means has an analogous effect.

Slow release and
consumption of water in situ are key to the efficient
MQ resin synthesis observed (Figure 2B–F). Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of alkoxysilanes
produces a silanol and alcohol (Figure 2C); silanols are also formed from hydrolysis of Me3SiOSiMe3 (Figure 2B). Acid-catalyzed condensation of two silanols leads
to disiloxanes and water (Figure 2E,F). The overall cascade progress is precisely controlled
by the rate of liberation of water in situ.

It is noted that
silicone polymers can be formed by redistribution
polymerization under acidic conditions with MM and D4 ((Me2SiO)4). The redistribution process favors (more
basic) M end groups compared to D units (Me2SiO). As a
consequence, slow growth in molecular weight occurs as D units are
inserted into the growing M-capped silicone chain (Figure 8A,B).13 In an analogous process, the hydrolysis and condensation of tetraalkoxysilanes
lead initially to linear silica fibrils that, at high conversion,
condense to form loose silica networks (Figure 8C–E);14 by contrast, under basic conditions, highly reticulated 3D structures
form.15,16Figure 8 Acid-catalyzed siloxane insertion reactions.



We speculate that the formation of MQ resins
using esterification
follows analogous pathways. That is, Q units derived from TEOS slowly
undergo hydrolysis and insertion into an M-rich structure, such that
relatively low Mw, mostly linear oligomers
are formed. A speculative model compound 1 is proposed
in Figure 2F,G. Such
a process would account for the narrow dispersity observed in the
product; because little water is present at any given time, evolving
products will have a relatively low concentration of SiOH groups remained
(as shown by IR; Figure 7). This proposal is further supported by the ability of almost completely
removing SiOH groups by gentle heating. This is likely the consequence
of the condensation of the few free SiOH groups to give compound 2, leading to a bimodal distribution, a mixture of monomers
and dimers/trimers/tetramers (Figure 2J). By contrast, normal hydrolytic processes of alkoxysilanes
that generate high SiOH concentrations in the MQ resin products are
able to undergo multiple condensations giving higher Mw, broader dispersity MQ resins.

The many methods
used to prepare MQ resins typically result in
complex mixtures with high dispersity and high alkoxy and/or SiOH
content. The described process, which hinges on the slow generation
of water provided by esterification to give ester solvents, avoids
these problems. In addition, the ester coproduct has commercial value.
Almost no waste is generated in this chlorine-free reaction, particularly
when compared to traditional reactions, which produce a complex mixture
of solvents, acid, salts, and alcohol in wastewater. This alternative
is completely greener.

Although this preparative method is still
in the early stage of
development, with respect to process optimization and also full molecular
and property characterizations of the products, it offers many advantages
over current processes. The main benefit is the narrower range of
mixtures of the products, the ability of tuning the molecular weight
in a programmed way, and the low SiOH content, which provides more
stable products over time. In addition, the process offers significant
environmental benefits and higher atom efficiency.

Conclusions
MQ resins constitute an important class of materials used to broaden
the properties and utility of silicone elastomers and gels. The use
of a cascade esterification process of acetic acid with alcohols generated
from tetraalkoxysilanes (and MM as the capping agent) only very slowly
generates water in situ. As a consequence, MQ resins of low dispersity
and of low SiOH and SiOR concentrations are produced. The Mw is readily increased by gentle thermal treatment.

Synthesis of MQ Silicone Resins by Hydrolysis: PolyTEOS
A general procedure is described for an M/Q ratio of 1:1. A mixture
of polyTEOS (152.00 g, 1.0 mol), hexamethyldisiloxane (81.00 g, 0.50
mol), ethanol (15.00 g, 0.33 mol), toluene (56.4 g, 0.61 mol), and
an acidic catalyst (36.5 wt % hydrochloric acid (6.33 g, 63 mmol))
was employed in a 1 L round-bottomed flask. Water (54.00 g, 3.0 mol)
was slowly added dropwise with stirring over 90 min and then the mixture
was heated to reflux (76 °C) for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature,
the mixture was allowed to stand to obtain a silanol-rich toluene
solution. Potassium hydroxide (0.26 g, 4.64 mmol) was added and the
mixture was refluxed for 3 h; a small amount of 36.5 wt % hydrochloric
acid was required to return the mixture to neutrality; residual ethanol
and water were removed by distillation under vacuum (6.0 kPa) and
dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent
was removed from the MQ siloxane resin by vacuum distillation, leaving
a white MQ siloxane resin powder (Table 2).

Synthesis of MQ Siloxane Resins by Cascade
Esterification: TEOS
Influence of Strong Acid Catalysts on the
Esterification Reaction:
TEOS
A comparison was made of several potential acid catalysts
for the esterification reaction starting from TEOS. The general procedure
described below was followed, with the exception of the specific strong
acid catalyst used (HOAc/TEOS mole ratio 4.4, M unit/Q unit mole feed
ratio 0.8, catalyst amount 3.0 wt % based on TEOS; Tables 3 and 4). Reaction temperature curves (Figure 3) and molecular weight distributions of the
samples by GPC were recorded (Figure 4).

The general procedure is described for the
sulfuric acid catalyst. TEOS (104 g, 0.5 mol), hexamethyldisiloxane
(32.4 g, 0.2 mol), and acetic acid (132 g, 2.2 mol) were added to
a 1 L three-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with high-speed mechanical
stirring, a condensing reflux tube, and a thermometer. The mixture
was warmed to 30 °C with stirring. The acidic catalyst, 98 wt
% H2SO4 (3.18 g, 31.8 mmol), was added dropwise
and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h without external heating.
Then, the mixture was heated to 78 °C (reflux temperature for
ethyl acetate) for 4 h. A Na2CO3 aqueous solution
(12.0%, 304.72 g) was used to neutralize the mixture after allowing
the mixture to cool to room temperature (with stirring); the MQ resin
solution was collected by draining away the aqueous layer and then
anhydrous sodium sulfate (10.07 g, 0.07 mol) was added to the organic
phase to remove water. The resulting transparent, colorless solution
was heated under a 6.0 kPa vacuum to remove the generated solvents
by distillation and then left at 120 °C for 3 h to give the MQ
resin as a solid white powder. When other catalysts were used, there
was a distinct difference in the observed exotherms (Figure 3).

It can be seen (Table 3) that the efficiency
of the reaction was high except for
ferric chloride. The catalyst used affected the dispersity of the
product. Me3SiCl and ferric chloride led to broad dispersities,
sulfuric acid and acetyl chloride led to bimodal distributions, whereas
triflic acid led cleanly to a unimodal distribution of low ĐM (Table 3). Sulfuric acid was chosen for further studies.

Effect of Catalyst Dosage (98% Concentrated Sulfuric Acid):
TEOS
The general procedure for an M/Q ratio = 0.80, HOAc/OEt
ratio = 1.1:1, 80 °C × 4 h is described. A mixture of TEOS
(26.0 g, 0.125 mol), hexamethyldisiloxane (8.1 g, 0.05 mol), HOAc
(33.0 mL, 0.55 mol), and 98% H2SO4 was added
into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask. The reaction mixture was stirred
at 30 °C for 60 min and then heated to 78 °C and allowed
to react for 4 h. Each vessel was quenched with Na2CO3 aqueous solution (15.0 wt %, to pH = 7) after the reaction
had cooled to room temperature. The MQ resin solution was collected
by draining away the aqueous layer and then anhydrous sodium sulfate
was added to the organic phase to remove water. The resulting transparent,
colorless solution was heated under a 6.0 kPa vacuum to remove the
generated solvents by distillation. The MQ resin solution in the organic
phase was heated at 80 °C at 6.0 kPa for 3 h (Table 4).

Effect of Silicon Starting
Material on Transesterification Product
Characteristics: TEOS vs PolyTEOS
Analogous recipes were
used to compare any differences in the MQ resins produced from TEOS
or polyTEOS. As can be seen in Table 5, both polysilicate and TEOS produced similar primary
resins under transesterification conditions.

TEOS (52.00 g,
0.25 mol); MM (16.20 g, 0.1 mol); HOAc (66.00 g, 1.1 mol); H2SO4 (98%, 0.53 g, 5.3 mmol); 15% Na2CO3 (aq) (109.75 g); Na2SO4 (5.17 g); yield
93.2%.

PolyTEOS (37.50 g, 0.25 mol); MM (16.20 g, 0.1 mol);
HOAc (33.00
g, 0.55 mol); H2SO4 (98%, 0.38 g, 3.8 mmol);
15% Na2CO3 (aq) (40.98 g); Na2SO4 (3.51); yield 96.5%.

Effect of Drying Time on
Product Characteristics: PolyTEOS (M/Q
0.8; HOAc/OEt 1.1:1)
PolyTEOS (225.00 g, 1.5 mol), MM (97.20
g, 0.6 mol), acetic acid (198.00 g, 3.3 mol), and sulfuric acid (3.31
g, 33.1 mmol) were used to establish whether removal of solvent played
an important role in the final product structure. Eight thermal protocols
were utilized, all of which involved drying under a vacuum of 6.0
kPa (Table 6). The
samples were characterized by IR and GPC (Figures 5 and 7). Figure 7 demonstrates that
the higher temperature process leads to materials that have, essentially
completely, lost the SiOH groups, as shown by the loss of signal between
3100 and 3700 cm–1 in the infrared spectrum. This
is consistent both with loss of water or residual alcohols and with
silanol condensation processes.

Effect of Reaction Time
on Product Characteristics: PolyTEOS
M/Q ratio = 0.80, HOAc/OEt
ratio = 1.1:1 (polyTEOS (225.00 g, 1.5
mol), MM (97.20 g, 0.6 mol), acetic acid (198.00 g, 3.3 mol), and
sulfuric acid (3.29 g, 32.9 mmol)). The reactants were allowed to
mix, which generated an exotherm in the case of sulfuric acid catalysis
(Figure 3). After 60
min, heating was started; reflux of EtOAc occurred at 78 °C;
reactions were allowed to proceed for an additional 1–5 h (t = 0 was designated as the onset of reflux). After cooling,
the resulting mixture was neutralized with sodium carbonate aqueous
solution (15.0 wt %, 326 mL). The MQ resin solution was collected
by draining away the aqueous layer. After drying the organic phase
over anhydrous sodium sulfate (51 g, 0.36 mol), the solution was filtered
and solvents were removed with heating under reduced pressure (6.0
kPa) and then heated at elevated temperature. The resulting filtrate
was dried at 150 °C under vacuum (6.0 kPa) to give the white
power (Table 7). The Mn did not substantially change over time, and
there was a narrowing of the dispersity (ĐM) over time.

Capping Agent (MM) Residues in the Products:
PolyTEOS
GC analyses of the products were performed to establish
whether residues
of the reaction had been removed. As shown in Figure 6, no evidence of the capping agent (MM) or
ethyl acetate could be detected in the product.

Effect of
M/Q Ratio on MQ Siloxane Resin Characteristics: PolyTEOS
The general procedure is described for a M/Q ratio of 1:1. A mixture
of polyTEOS (152.00 g, 1.0 mol), MM (81.00 g, 0.5 mol), acetic acid
(144.00 g, 2.4 mol), and sulfuric acid (4.71 g, 47 mmol) was stirred
for 1 h without external heating in a 1 L three-neck round-bottomed
flask equipped with strong stirring, a condensing reflux tube, and
a thermometer. The reaction mixture was heated at 78 °C (reflux
temperature of EtOAc) for 4 h. After cooling, the resulting mixture
was neutralized with sodium carbonate aqueous solution (15.0 wt %,
261.97 mL); the MQ resin solution was collected by draining away the
aqueous layer. After drying the organic phase over anhydrous sodium
sulfate (18.75 g, 0.13 mol), the solution was filtered and solvents
were removed with heating under reduced pressure (6.0 kPa) and then
heated at elevated temperature (150 °C) for 3 h to obtain the
MQ siloxane resin (Table 8).

Note: polyTEOS is partly hydrolyzed TEOS that (upon
drying) leads to 40 wt % SiO2. Assuming the other 60% is
ethanol, the nominal structure of the material is (HO)2Si(OEt)2 with an Mw of 152.

Batch Consistency: TEOS
Three repetitions of an identical
reaction were made to examine batch consistency following the general
procedure (Introduction section) described
above: TEOS (6.24 g, 0.03 mol), hexamethyldisiloxane (1.65 g, 10.2
mmol), HOAc (5.26 mL, 0.092 mol), and 98% H2SO4 (33.9 μL, 62.4 mg, 0.64 mmol) were mixed in a 15 mL glass
bottle. The solution was separated into three aliquots, in round-bottomed
flasks of 4.4263, 4.4176, and 4.3240 g. Following three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles to replace air with nitrogen, the reaction was stirred at 30
°C for 30 min, heated to 80 °C, and reacted for 4 h (in
the same oil bath at the same time). Each vessel was quenched with
Na2CO3 aqueous solution (20 wt %, 2.0 mL) after
it cooled to room temperature. The MQ resin solution was collected
by draining away the aqueous layer and then anhydrous sodium sulfate
(10.07 g, 0.07 mol) was added to the organic phase to remove water.
The resulting transparent, colorless solution was heated under a 6.0
kPa vacuum to remove the generated solvents by distillation. The MQ
resin solutions in the organic phase were heated at 70 °C at
20 mmHg until a constant mass was reached. The obtained MQ resin was
characterized by GPC (see Table 9).
