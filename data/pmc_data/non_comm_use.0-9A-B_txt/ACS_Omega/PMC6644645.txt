A model is established
to investigate the release and condensation
of inorganics for a wood steam/oxygen-blown fluidized-bed gasification
process. In the established model, fates of major elements (C, H,
O, N, S, and Cl) and minor elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P,
Si, Ti, and Zn) are modeled separately. The composition of gaseous
species involving major elements is predicted using Aspen Plus based
on a semiempirical model. The release of minor elements and the condensation
of inorganics are predicted using software SimuSage. The combination
of Aspen Plus with SimuSage is achieved by manually inputting the
stream parameters calculated from Aspen Plus into SimuSage. On the
basis of this developed model, effects of gasification temperature
on the condensation of Na-, K-, and Cl-containing species during gas
cooling are studied. Results show that the process model established
by combining Aspen Plus and SimuSage is valid and can be used to investigate
the release of inorganics during gasification and condensation of
inorganics during gas cooling. Under the investigated gasification
conditions, regardless of the bed material, there are two temperature
ranges within which no salt melt is formed during gas cooling. As
the gasification temperature increases, the high-temperature range
without salt melt formation becomes successively wider.

1 Introduction
Gasification, as one of
the thermochemical conversion pathways,
efficiently converts different biomass feedstock into a product gas,
comprising permanent gas components such as CO, CO2, CH4, and H2. The product gas can be utilized to produce
high-value-added chemicals, transportation fuels, and other energy
carriers after upgrading.1,2 However, the product
gas from a biomass-fueled gasifier commonly contains contaminants
such as alkalis, particulates, HCl, H2S, COS, NH3, and HCN.3 The contaminant, alkalis,
could poison catalysts in downstream process equipment.4 In addition, gaseous alkalis are condensable
and can condense out of the gas phase when gas temperature decreases,
generally resulting in problems such as ash deposition and equipment
corrosion.5,6 It is therefore necessary to investigate
the release and condensation of alkalis to eliminate these problems.

Both experimental measurement7−15 and chemical equilibrium calculation7,8,16 have been conducted for the release of alkali metals
during biomass gasification. It is well known that factors including
gasifier type,17 gasification conditions,18 feedstock impurities,4,19,20 tars,9 and bed
materials8,21 can affect the release of alkali metals
during biomass gasification. In terms of the condensation of inorganics
during gas cooling, studies are generally performed based on thermodynamic
equilibrium calculations. One typical equilibrium calculation study
was conducted by Froment et al.,17 using
FactSage 5.4.1 to investigate the speciation of the condensed phase
during gas cooling from 1300 to 25 °C. In FactSage, the product
composition calculation is based on a global thermodynamic equilibrium
model. This kind of model is characterized by underestimating the
yields of CO2, tars, light hydrocarbons, and char, as well
as overestimating the yields of H2 and CO.22,23 The inaccurate yields of major gas species may affect the release
of alkali metals during gasification16 and
may also affect the fate of inorganics during gas cooling. Furthermore,
melts are not taken into account in the thermodynamic database used
by Froment et al.17 This may lead to inaccurate
prediction of the speciation of the condensed phase during both gasification
and gas cooling. Therefore, a more accurate model and a proper thermodynamic
database are required to improve the prediction of the release and
condensation of inorganics.

Besides investigating the release
of inorganics during gasification
in a gasifier and the condensation of inorganics in equipment such
as heat exchanger, there is a need to investigate the fate of inorganics
at other positions of a gasification system. This is most practicably
performed by means of process modeling. At present, most developed
process models do not consider inorganic elements, apart from nitrogen
and sulfur.24−26 Moreover, ash is generally treated as an unconventional
inert component, not participating in the chemical and phase equilibriums.
Font Palma and Martin27 utilized process
simulation software Aspen Plus to investigate the partition of inorganic
constituents formed in a gasification process of 200 kW on-site power
generation using poultry litter as the feedstock; only six inorganic
elements and a limited number of species are considered in their work.
Michael Stemmler et al.28 developed a process
model using SimuSage with a pure substance database of FactSage 5.3.
In their process model, the formation of only methane and ethylene
is considered by reducing the amount of carbon and hydrogen. Other
nonequilibrium factors such as the formation of char and tar are not
considered. In short, there is a lack of accurate process modeling
and use of thermodynamic databases involving both organic and inorganic
elements.

In the present study, a process model is established
by combining
Aspen Plus with SimuSage. Because Aspen Plus has abundant model blocks
and can also establish a user model by programming subroutines, it
is used for predicting the composition of major gas components, light
hydrocarbons, tars, unconverted carbon, and NH3 based on
a semiempirical model. SimuSage is a ChemApp-based set of Delphi components
for flowsheeting, which can be used for process simulation using a
customized thermodynamic database, despite that only limited types
of blocks are available for the modeling. Because of the convenience
of importing a customized thermodynamic database, SimuSage is used
for determining the release of inorganics during gasification and
condensation of inorganics during gas cooling. A comprehensive thermodynamic
database extracted from FactSage 7.1 is used for SimuSage calculations,
including data for gas, solid, and liquid phases (and solution phases).
On the basis of the established model and the customized thermodynamic
database, effects of gasification temperature on the condensation
of Na-, K-, and Cl-containing species during gas cooling were investigated.
This study is part of our ongoing research to develop a tool for predicting
the fate of inorganics in the downstream processing equipment of a
steam/oxygen pressurized fluidized-bed gasification system from feedstock
to the end product. In our previous study,29 experimental and modeling work of biomass gasification and inorganics
condensation has been performed. Results from the developed model
have been compared with the experimental results, and a reasonable
agreement is achieved. In this work, the developed model is further
improved on the method of obtaining the composition of main gas components.
The composition of main gas components is measured using online gas
chromatography in our previous study. In this study, the composition
of main gas components is calculated on the basis of a semiempirical
model developed using Aspen Plus. In this way, effects of various
parameters on the system involving inorganics can be directly investigated.

2 Methodologies
2.1 Overall Model Description
The developed
process model is based on the following assumptions: the process is
at a steady state; all reactions associated with inorganic elements
reach equilibrium; there is no pressure loss along the process stream;
reactions involving major elements such as C, H, O, N, S, and Cl occur
first, followed by reactions involving minor elements (Al, Ca, Fe,
K, Mg, Na, P, Si, and Ti).

The methodology for process model
development is depicted in Figure 1. Overall, fates of major elements and minor elements
are modeled separately. The composition of gaseous species, involving
major elements, is predicted using a semiempirical model. The parameters
for gaseous species, formed by major elements, serve as input data
for the chemical equilibrium model for minor elements. The condensation
of gaseous inorganics during gas cooling is calculated on the basis
of an equilibrium model. The developed process model can predict the
release and condensation of inorganics under nearly actual process
conditions.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of model development.

2.2 Semiempirical Model for Major Elements
At large, a biomass gasification process includes several steps such
as drying, devolatilization, and gasification (oxidation and gasification).23,30 The drying and devolatilization steps occur instantaneously under
the environment of high temperature and intense heat transfer. Then,
in the presence of the injected gasification agent, both homogeneous
and heterogeneous gasification reactions occur. Therein, exothermic
oxidation reactions provide the heat for endothermic reduction reactions.
One point to note is that there are no obvious boundaries for the
above-mentioned three steps because of the boundary overlap.

In an actual gasification process, the carbon in biomass is not completely
converted and the gas residence time in the gasifier is also limited.
Because of the presence of these nonequilibrium factors, the yields
of H2 and CO are overpredicted and the yields of CO2, light hydrocarbons, tars, and char are underpredicted by
the global thermodynamic equilibrium calculations.22,23 In terms of nitrogen, experimental results by de Jong et al.31 show that the primary N-containing component
is NH3. The experimental measurements, performed by Zhou
et al.,32 also imply that NH3 and N2 are two dominant components derived from the nitrogen
in the fuel, whereas equilibrium models predict that most of the nitrogen
in the fuel is released in the form of N2. Therefore, reactions
involving nitrogen are far from equilibrium under real gasification
conditions. In the present study, a semiempirical model is used to
predict the composition of major gaseous species from gasifier using
empirical correlations to predict the yields of nonequilibrium species.
These empirical correlations, shown in Table 1, are fitted with experimental data from
pressurized steam/O2-blown fluidized-bed gasification with
forest residues and crushed wood pellets as feedstock.33

a T represents gasifier

The correlations shown in Table 1 are valid only for a gasification process
using a
similar feedstock (crushed wood pellets and forest residues) and a
similar gasifier type and configuration. Furthermore, these correlations
are valid only within the range of the data used for fitting the model
parameters.33

The semiempirical model
for the major elements is established using
five blocks, as depicted in Figure 2. A Ryield block is used to model the biomass drying
and devolatization processes, where biomass (CHαOβClγNχSδ(ash)ε(H2O)ø) is decomposed
into C, H, O, N, S, Cl, ash, and H2O according to ultimate
and proximate analyses. This is fulfilled by a programed FORTRAN subroutine. R1  wherein φ means the percentage of carbon
participating in the actual gasification process; the carbon conversion
is estimated using empirical correlations (see Table 1). The unconverted carbon ((1 – φ)C)
is separated out using a Sep block. Q represents
the heat energy used for decomposing the biomass, which is derived
from the gasification section.

Figure 2 Semiempirical model established using
Aspen Plus for major elements.

A RGibbs block is adopted to model the gasification section,
predicting
the chemical composition of the product gas based on the principle
of Gibbs free energy minimization.34,35 The possible
products, specified in the Gibbs block, include H2, CO,
CO2, H2O, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8,
C6H6, C10H8, N2, NH3, HCN, HCl, H2S, COS, and ash components.
In Aspen Plus, ash is generally regarded as an unconventional inert
component and therefore it does not participate in chemical and phase
equilibriums. To study the fate of the actual ash components and to
avoid a doubling input of the ash content, inert ash (ε ash)
is first removed by using a Sep block with a subsequent addition of
various ash components in the gasification section. Because the removed
inert ash takes a part of heat away, to sustain the energy balance
of the system, the heat carried by the inert ash is supplemented to
the gasification section. Because the release of inorganic elements
during gasification is modeled in SimuSage, these added ash components
are still set as nonreacting components in Aspen Plus.

2.3 Model for Studying the Fate of Inorganics
during Gasification and Gas Cooling
Figure 3 depicts the schematic diagram of a model
for studying the fate of inorganics during both gasification and gas
cooling. The release of minor elements during biomass gasification
is modeled using TPbGttBalance and TPbPhaseSplitter. Gas cooling is
modeled using TPbHeatExch with TPbGttBalance. TPbPhaseSplitter is
used to model separation of the condensed phase from the gas phase.
The parameters of gaseous species, calculated by Aspen Plus, serve
as input data for SimuSage. Because TPbGttBalance performs complete
equilibrium calculations based on the parameters of inlet streams
and reaction conditions, nonequilibrium factors cannot be taken into
account. Therefore, nonequilibrium species, including CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C6H6, C10H8, and NH3, are removed before
the SimuSage calculations. To consider the potential effects of CH4 and other hydrocarbons on the fate of inorganics during both
gasification and gas cooling, formations of CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C6H6,
and C10H8 are taken into account during SimuSage
calculations. This leads to the formation of minor amounts of CH4 (around 0.001 vol % level) and other light hydrocarbons (less
than 0.001 vol % level). In view of the large volume of major gas
species, the minor amounts of the formed CH4 and light
hydrocarbons can be neglected.

Figure 3 Model established using SimuSage for studying
the release and condensation
of inorganics.

The thermodynamic database
used in SimuSage comprises 17 elements
(C, H, O, N, P, S, Cl, Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Si, Ti, Mn, K, Na, and Zn),
100 pure liquids, 677 pure solids, 144 gaseous species, and 18 solution
phases (15 solid solution phases and 3 liquid solution phases). A
more comprehensive description of this customized thermodynamic database
can be found in our previous study.29

2.4 Model Parameters
Because of ash component
analysis data not being given in the study fitting empirical correlations,33 a wood with similar proximate, ultimate and
heating value data is used as feedstock for calculations. Table 2 presents the proximate
analysis, the ultimate analysis, the high heating value, and the ash
analysis of wood. The ash content in wood is measured by ashing the
wood at 750 °C. The elements in wood contain C, H, O, N, S, Cl,
Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Si, and Ti.

Table 3 shows the
gasifier operating parameters. Table 4 shows the feeding conditions of feedstock. The data
shown in Tables 3 and 4 are the same as or within the range of parameters
that are used for fitting empirical correlations.33 For a given gasification temperature, the flow rate of
oxygen is calculated based on the energy balance.

is within the experimentally used range of the ratio of the bed material
feed rate to the biomass feed rate.36

3 Model Validation
In terms of the semiempirical
model for the major elements, the
predicted composition of main product gas components including H2, CO, CO2, and H2O in the wet gas is
compared with the wet gas composition measured for the experiments
using similar feedstock composition, as illustrated in Figure 4. For the modeling case using
a gasification temperature of 823 °C, the mass ratio of steam
to fuel is set as 0.50 to be consistent with the experimental operating
conditions. Figure 4 shows that for the concentrations of H2, CO, CO2, and H2O, the averaged relative error between the calculated
and measured values is 19%. The relative error is defined as the ratio
of the absolute value of the difference between the calculated value
and measured value to the measured value. The relative errors predicted
by the complete thermodynamic equilibrium model are 55.6% for the
molar fraction of CO2, 84% for the molar fraction of CO,
and 111.1% for the molar fraction of H2.88 Compared with the composition
predicted by the complete thermodynamic equilibrium model,8 the composition of main product gas components
predicted using the developed semiempirical model has been much closer
to the experimentally measured composition. Additionally, the experimental
data is expected to have an error of around 5%.33 Judging by the results, reasonably good agreement between
the measured values and the values predicted by the model developed
using Aspen Plus has been achieved. One point should be noted that
the experimental data used for comparison are derived from the gasification
experiments using a similar feedstock. On condition that good experimental
data are collected for fitting empirical correlations, the predicted
composition would be more accurate.

Figure 4 Comparison of the predicted composition
with the experimentally
measured composition of main product gas components in the wet product
gas.

In the case of the model for studying
the fate of inorganics during
both gasification and gas cooling, the predicted elemental compositions
of the condensed phase under different cooling temperatures are in
general consistent with the elemental compositions identified using
scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(SEM/EDS).29 This demonstrates that this
model, developed using SimuSage, is valid for the investigation of
the release and condensation of inorganics.

In summary, the
model established by combining Aspen Plus and SimuSage
is valid and can be used to investigate the release of inorganics
during gasification and the condensation of inorganics during gas
cooling.

4 Model Application
The developed model
is applied to investigate the condensation
of Na-, K-, and Cl-containing species during gas cooling from four
initial gasification temperatures (885 °C, 870 °C, 855 °C,
and 840 °C) to 350 °C. The four gasification temperatures
are within the range of the data used for fitting the empirical correlations.
The developed model is valid to be used to investigate the effects
of gasification temperature. Other model parameters (wood composition
and gasification conditions) are the same as given in Section 2.4. The equilibrium calculation
and experimental measurement performed by Scott Q. Turn showed that
only a part of bed material actually participates in the elemental
partition during gasification.8 The study
by Porbatzki et al.7 also indicated that
the releases of inorganic species such as KCl(g), HCl(g), and H2S(g) are strongly affected by other elements (e.g., Si and
Ca) in the fuel. Additionally, because of the poor mixing of the bed
material and biomass in the gasifier, not all biomass can interact
with the bed material during gasification. Therefore, two boundary
cases including with and without addition of bed material in the gasifier
are modeled in the present study. This could help have a comprehensive
understanding on the effects of gasification temperature. The calculation
threshold for all cases is set as 1 × 10–6. Figure 5 quantitatively presents
the proportion of Na, K, and Cl remained in the gas phase (Rg) after gas cooling. Rg is defined as eq 1. 1  where ng is the
initial amount of element in the gas phase, equal to the amount of
each element released into the gas phase during gasification, and ngc represents the amount of element remained
in the gas phase after gas cooling.

Figure 5 Relationship between cooling temperature
and proportion of each
element remained in the gas phase after gas cooling under different
gasification temperatures (885 °C, 870 °C, 855 °C,
and 840 °C). Bed material is included.

For the case without addition of bed material during gasification,
the trends between the cooling temperature and the proportion of each
element (Na, K, and Cl) remained in the gas phase are the same as
those for the case with the addition of bed material. Therefore, only
the relationships between the cooling temperature and Rg of Na, K, and Cl in the case of addition of bed material
are presented in Figure 5.

Overall, regardless of the gasification temperature, proportions
of Na, K, and Cl remained in the gas phase decrease with the cooling
temperature until being constant. Additionally, the three elements
have different condensation rates. For the investigated four gasification
temperatures, the sodium-related species are first condensed out of
the gas phase, followed by potassium- and chlorine-related species.
The different condensation rates of Na and K have also been observed
in the study by Froment et al.17 Because
gaseous alkalis are primarily condensed in the form of carbonates
and only a little amount of gaseous alkalis is condensed as chlorides
(see Figure 6), the
fraction of Cl remained in the gas phase is higher than the fractions
of Na and K during gas cooling. Under the specified calculation threshold
(1 × 10–6), the sodium- and potassium-related
species can be completely condensed out of the gas phase after 660
°C and 410 °C, respectively (see Figure 5). There are nearly no Na- and K-containing
species in the gas phase, as the cooling temperature is lower than
410 °C. However, chlorine remains in the gas phase in the form
of HCl(g).17 In short, gas cooling is beneficial
for removing alkalis in the product gas but not useful for removing
some chlorine-containing species such as HCl(g).

Figure 6 Relationship between
cooling temperature and accumulated mass of
each condensate under different gasification temperatures (885 °C,
870 °C, 855 °C, and 840 °C): (a) with bed material
addition and (b) without bed material addition.

Figure 6 shows
that
for both cases with and without addition of bed material, the amount
of condensate increases with the increase of gasification temperature.
This can be explained that for these investigated gasification temperatures
more volatile elements can be released into the gas phase at a higher
gasification temperature;17,19 more gaseous inorganics
are consequently condensed out of the gas phase during gas cooling
for the case using a higher gasification temperature.

Figure 6 depicts
that for both the cases with and without addition of bed material
under all investigated gasification temperatures Na and K in the condensed
phases are mainly present in the forms of chlorides, hydroxides, and
carbonates. For some gasification temperatures, minor amounts of K2S(l) and Na2S(l) are also formed in the condensed
phase (see Figure 6). The presence of S, K, and Na in the condensates is also observed
using SEM/EDS in the inorganics condensation experiments.29 For the case with addition of bed material,
potassium carbonates (K2CO3(ss) and K2CO3(s)) and potassium chloride (KCl(ss)) are main condensates
(see Figure 6a). For
the case without addition of bed material, K2CO3(ss) and KCl(ss) are dominant condensates followed by K2CO3(l) (see Figure 6b). The cooling calculations performed by Froment et al.17 also indicated that K2CO3(s) is the main condensate followed by KCl(s), whereas no liquid
condensates are predicted to be present. This difference in the mass
distribution of condensates between our and Froment’s studies
can be attributed to the thermodynamic database. Because solution
phases are not taken into account in the database used by Froment
et al.,17 no formation of melt and solid
solution phases can be predicted during condensation calculations
in their study.

Regardless of the gasification temperature and
bed material, two
temperature ranges are present within which no salt melt is formed
during gas cooling. The two temperature ranges are separately distributed
in a low-temperature zone (less than 660 °C) and a high-temperature
zone (higher than 685 °C, less than Tm). Tm represents the maximum temperature
of the corresponding temperature range. Within the temperature range
from 660 °C to 685 °C, the salt melt is formed during gas
cooling.

Figure 7 shows the
high-temperature range without melt formation during gas cooling for
each gasification temperature. For the case without addition of bed
material, the theoretical high-temperature ranges without melt formation
are within 685–835 °C, 685–835 °C, 685–810
°C, and 685–785 °C for gasification temperatures
885 °C, 870 °C, 855 °C, and 840 °C, respectively.
For the case with addition of bed material, the corresponding high-temperature
ranges are 685–885 °C, 685–860 °C, 685–855
°C, and 685–840 °C. For a specific gasification temperature,
the temperature range without salt melt formation is wider for the
case with addition of bed material compared with the case without
addition of bed material. Furthermore, with the increasing gasification
temperature, the high-temperature range without salt melt formation
becomes successively wider.

Figure 7 Temperature range in the high-temperature zone
without melt formation
during gas cooling under different gasification temperatures (885
°C, 870 °C, 855 °C, and 840 °C): (a) with bed
material addition and (b) without bed material addition.

Beacuse no salt melt can be formed within the temperature
ranges
shown in Figure 7,
high-temperature filters can be operated within these temperature
ranges to avoid ash deposition and corrosion. One point should be
noted that steam and tars may be condensed of the gas phase as the
gas temperature is decreased. For this point, water saturation temperature
and tar dew point are calculated. The saturated temperature of water
at 2.5 bar is calculated to be 127.4 °C. The tar dew points are
calculated using a complete tar dew point model developed by Energy
Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN).37 A detailed description of the tar dew point model can be found elsewhere.37,38 The calculated tar dew point is around 72 °C, which is obviously
lower than the given temperature ranges shown in Figure 7. Actually, except for the
two tar model compounds (C6H6 and C10H8) used in the present study, other tar compounds with
much higher boiling points are also present in the gasification product
gas. Despite this, the measured tar dew point is reported to be lower
than 370 °C,39,40 which is also below the high-temperature
ranges given in Figure 7. Therefore, there is no possibility of forming liquid condensed
water and condensed tars under these temperature ranges where no salt
melt can be formed. To remove the fine ash and other particles from
the raw product gas without causing filter failure, the operating
temperature of high-temperature filters can be fixed within these
predicted temperature ranges. It should be noted that the given temperature
ranges without forming the salt melt are merely theoretical ranges.
The detailed temperature ranges and the possibility of applying the
temperature ranges of not forming salt melt still need to be experimentally
demonstrated.

5 Conclusions
A model
is established to investigate the release and condensation
of inorganics for a wood steam/oxygen-blown fluidized-bed gasification
process. In the established model, fates of major elements (C, H,
O, N, S, and Cl) and minor elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P,
Si, Ti, and Zn) are modeled separately. The composition of gaseous
species, involving major elements, is predicted using Aspen Plus based
on a semiempirical model. The model established using Aspen Plus consists
of five sections including biomass decomposition, ash separation,
ash heat recovery, unconverted carbon separation, and gasification.
The release of minor elements and the condensation of inorganics are
predicted using SimuSage. The release of minor elements during biomass
gasification is modeled using TPbGttBalance and TPbPhaseSplitter.
The gas cooling is modeled using TPbHeatExch with TPbGttBalance. TPbPhaseSplitter
is used for modeling the separation of condensed phase from the gas
phase. The combination of Aspen Plus with SimuSage is achieved by
manually inputting the stream parameters calculated from Aspen Plus
into SimuSage. On the basis of this established model, effects of
gasification temperature on the condensation of Na-, K-, and Cl-containing
species during gas cooling are studied. From the obtained results,
the following conclusions can be made. The process model established
by combining Aspen Plus and SimuSage is valid and can be used to investigate
the release of inorganics during gasification and condensation of
inorganics during gas cooling. Under the investigated gasification
conditions, regardless of the bed material, there are two temperature
ranges within which no salt melt is formed during gas cooling. As
gasification temperature increases, the high-temperature range without
salt melt formation becomes successively wider.
