The
use of ionic liquids (ILs) in the biorefinery process has been
increasing for the past few decades. In biorefinery, the separation
process with respect to sugars needs to be evaluated for an efficient
process design. Therefore, the present work aims to investigate the
separation of sugars and ILs by means of a precipitation process using
an antisolvent method. For this purpose, both theoretical and experimental
studies were conducted. Initially, the conductor-like screening model
for real solvents model was employed to screen the suitable antisolvents
for the separation of sugars from the ILs. From the screening study,
dichloromethane (DCM) and 1,2-dichloroethane were found to be the
better antisolvents for the separation process. With the selected
antisolvents, precipitation experiments were conducted for the mixtures
involving four different sugars and three ILs at different experimental
conditions. The process variables such as different antisolvents,
sugars, ILs, antisolvent–IL molar ratios, and temperatures
were examined in terms of their effect on sugar removal and IL recovery.
DCM was found to be the most suitable antisolvent in this study with
90–99% of sugar removal and 80–98% of IL recovery. Further,
molecular dynamics simulations were adopted to understand the structural
properties of carbohydrates with ILs and antisolvents via interaction
energies, hydrogen bonding, and coordination numbers. It was observed
that the interaction energy between the sugars and IL plays a critical
role in the removal of sugar. Higher the interaction energy between
the sugars and IL, lower is the sugar removal.

Introduction
The continuous population
growth has led to an increased consumption
of fossil fuels for the production of energy and chemicals.1 However, the changes made to harness the fossil
resources have made a significant impact on the economic and environmental
processes. To decrease the usage of fossil resources and nonrenewable
resources, an alternative approach is required.2,3 The
utilization of lignocellulosic biomass is one such alternative which
can act as a suitable energy source.1,4 Biomass is
an environmentally favorable and the most abundant renewable raw material
that can be used as a fuel source.5 The
major components of lignocellulosic biomass are cellulose (30–50%),
hemicellulose (25–35%), and aromatic polymer lignin (5–30%).1,2,4 Currently, an extensive research
is carried out for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to value-added
chemicals.6−8 The conversion of biomass consists of a set of chemical
and biological processes, including separation, conversion of biopolymers
into other valuable products, and fermentation reactions.5,9−11 Because of the complex structure and strong intra-
and intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the biomass, these processes
require suitable solvents for the dissolution of its components.5

Over the past few decades, ionic liquids
(ILs) are currently being
explored as an alternative class of solvents in biorefinery processes.12 ILs possess several significant properties such
as negligible vapor pressure and high thermal and chemical stability
which are useful for biorefinery processing.7,12 Apart
from the dissolution of carbohydrates, ILs also have been reported
to solubilize the major polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin) and convert them into amorphous compounds which accelerate
further enzymatic hydrolysis.13,14 On the other hand,
ILs can also be used as cocatalysts in the acidic hydrolysis of biomass
for the production of sugars, thereby yielding a higher conversion
at faster rates when compared with the process without ILs.15 Several studies have reported the solubility
of simple carbohydrates and sugar alcohols in ILs.16−22 However, the recovery data of sugars and ILs from their mixtures
are scarce.

The separation of carbohydrates from ILs as well
as their further
recycling is extremely important with respect to the process economics,
particularly in biorefineries using ILs. The recovery of ILs is essential
so as to retain the economic feasibility because of the high prices
associated with the ILs. For the separation of ILs and polysaccharides,
it is comparatively easy to precipitate polysaccharides from the IL
solutions. However, the separation of simple carbohydrates such as
monosaccharides and sugar alcohols (xylitol or sorbitol) from ILs
remains an interesting task. A few attempts with techniques such as
chromatographic method, aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), solid-phase
extraction, and crystallization/precipitation using antisolvents have
been made so far.23−28

Feng et al. (2011)29 studied the
separation
of glucose from the dimethylphosphate anion-based ILs by applying
liquid chromatography. They achieved more than 90% of IL and glucose
recovery. Further, Mai et al. (2012)30 separated
glucose and xylose from 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc])
using simulated moving bed chromatography coupled with an ion-exclusion
column. The amounts of 71.38% of glucose, 99.37% of xylose, and 98.92%
of [Emim][OAc] were recovered from the aqueous mixtures. Despite being
very effective, these chromatographic methods require very expensive
columns which make the operation costs high. Recently, Tonova (2012)23 reported the use of ABS to separate xanthan
and maltose from water/1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
and 3-methyl-1-octylimidazolium chloride/K2HPO4. To separate maltose from IL, the solution mixture was cooled down
to 0 °C. It resulted in the formation of two liquid phases, namely
an upper layer containing maltose and a lower phase (IL-rich) for
IL recycling and reutilization. ABS requires another additional nonvolatile
solvent to completely recover the sugars from the salt/sugar mixtures.
This can be achieved by using the antisolvent methods or the “solventing
out” phenomenon. The antisolvent methods have already gained
importance for drug recovery, separation of nanoparticles, separation
of taurine, fractionation of biomass, and other applications.26,31−33

Liu et al. (2011) and Hassan et al. (2013)
have reported the potential
of the antisolvent method to separate glucose from different ILs at
different conditions in the mixtures containing antisolvents and ILs.
The effects of various experimental variables such as temperature,
antisolvents, different ILs, antisolvent to IL molar ratios, and water
content were reported.34,35 In addition, Carneiro et al.
(2014) studied the experimental separation of sugar and sugar alcohols
from different IL–antisolvent mixtures at room temperatures
by varying the antisolvent to IL molar ratio (R)
from 5 to 35. At optimal conditions, more than 80% of IL recovery
and 83% of sugar removal were observed (R = 20).26 However, the screening of antisolvents and their
interactions with sugars and ILs are not yet reported. Therefore,
the application of antisolvents in separating the monomeric sugars
from ILs has to be explored in terms of theoretical and experimental
aspects.

In the present study, the separation of carbohydrates
from ILs
using an antisolvent method was studied by applying both computational
and experimental aspects. Initially, the conductor-like screening
model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) model was employed to screen the
suitable antisolvents for the separation of sugars from ILs. Thereafter,
the selected antisolvents were used for the precipitation experiments
for the mixtures containing four different sugars (glucose, xylose,
fructose, and galactose) and three ILs at different experimental conditions.
The experimental environments such as different antisolvents, antisolvent
to IL molar ratios, and temperatures were also investigated. Furthermore,
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to understand
the basic mechanism of sugar–IL separations using antisolvents.

Results
and Discussion
In the present study, the mixture of carbohydrate
+ IL was separated
by using an antisolvent method. The solubility data of carbohydrates
in different ILs were taken from previous literature (Figure S1), and the antisolvents were screened
by the COSMO-RS model. In our earlier work, we have successfully validated
the COSMO-RS model with the available experimental infinite dilution
activity coefficients (IDAC) of different solutes in ILs.12 Nevertheless, a separate benchmark study was
also performed for the solubility of monosaccharides in ILs using
the COSMO-RS model.22 Furthermore, the
COSMO-RS model was again revalidated with the known experimental data
of sugar (fructose and sucrose) separation from [Emim][EtSO4] using different antisolvents.26 The
summary of the benchmarked predicted results is presented in Figure 1a (fructose–[Emim][EtSO4]–antisolvents) and Figure 1b (sucrose–[Emim][EtSO4]–antisolvents) as a function of logarithmic IDAC (ln γ).
From Figure 1, it is
observed that lower the IDAC value (i.e., ln γ < 1) of an
antisolvent in IL, higher is the recovery of IL. On the other hand,
a higher IDAC value of sugar in the antisolvent effects a higher removal
of sugar from IL. The results from the above validation study gave
a good agreement with the experimental recovery data. After the successful
benchmarking study, we shall now move to the screening exercise which
will be done in two steps, namely (a) screening of antisolvents in
IL and (b) screening of sugars in antisolvents. The results of both
will then be used to choose the suitable antisolvent.

antisolvents. The antisolvent experimental data were taken from Carneiro
et al. (2014).26

Screening of Antisolvents by the COSMO-RS Model
In
this section, 35 antisolvents, 11 different carbohydrates, and 27
ILs (composed of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium [Emim]+ cation
and 27 different anions) have been screened by the COSMO-RS model.
The main aim of the COSMO-RS screening study is to provide a suitable
antisolvent(s) for the separation of sugar and sugar alcohols from
ILs by computing the IDAC values.

Figures 2 and 3 represent the
predicted logarithmic IDAC of 35 antisolvents. The logarithmic activity
coefficients of antisolvents in ILs (Figure 2) and carbohydrates in antisolvents (Figure 3) at infinite dilution
are considered together as a quantitative measurement for the solvation
power of the antisolvent. The antisolvents were sorted according to
their miscibility capacity and arranged in such a way that the antisolvents
with high dissolving power (logarithmic negative values of γ,
i.e., ln γ ≤ 1) are situated in the left portion of Figures 2 and 3 and the weaker ones (positive values of ln γ, i.e.,
ln γ ≫ 1) are situated in the right portion of Figures 2 and 3. Lower the activity coefficient values, greater is the tendency
for the antisolvent to solvate the IL and carbohydrate. For the separation
process using an antisolvent method, the antisolvent should be miscible
with IL (ln γ ≤ 1), but immiscible with carbohydrate
(ln γ ≫ 1). As can be seen from Figure 2, the antisolvents such as acetic acid, ethylene
glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, chloroform, formamide, dichloromethane
(DCM), and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) are predicted to be miscible with
ILs more efficiently, whereas in the case of the carbohydrate–antisolvent
system (Figure 3),
the antisolvents, namely acetonitrile, nitromethane, DCM, and DCE
are predicted to be immiscible with the carbohydrates. Therefore,
according to the precipitation concept, the chosen antisolvent should
be miscible with IL and immiscible with the carbohydrate. Therefore,
the following antisolvents, namely DCM and DCE have been preferred
for both experiments and MD simulations.

Moreover, from a close look at Figures 2 and 3, nitromethane
also seemed to be a potential antisolvent as similar to DCE; however,
DCE was preferred owing to its lower boiling point and economic aspects.
The boiling points of DCM, DCE, and nitromethane and other antisolvents
are listed in Table S1. On the other hand,
nitromethane gave less IDAC values of carbohydrates as compared to
DCE (e.g., ln γ of glucose in DCE is 12.37, whereas in the case
nitromethane, it is 6.98). Hence, we have excluded nitromethane from
the separation experiments, although nitromethane could be used as
a potential antisolvent in the carbohydrate separation process.

Experimental Separation of Sugars from ILs
After the
successful screening of antisolvents using the COSMO-RS model, the
precipitation experiments were performed for sugars such as glucose,
fructose, xylose, and galactose from ILs ([Emim][EtSO4],
[Emim][SCN], and [Emim][MeSO3]) using DCM and DCE as the
antisolvents. As can be seen from Figure 2, in terms of IDAC values, lower the IDAC
values from unity, that is, the blue shaded region, better is the
IL. Thus, [Emim][OAc] is the best solvent. It should be noted that
other than the solubility of IL and the antisolvent, the recovery
of sugar is also a critical issue. This is primarily done by boiling
the solution such that the antisolvent, because of its lower boiling
point, separates out easily from the IL–antisolvent mixture.
Therefore, for an overall selection of an IL and antisolvent pair,
one should have negative values of ln γ (Figure 2) and highly positive values of ln γ
(Figure 3) for the
sugars in the antisolvent. The IL [Emim][OAc] is known to be a powerful
solvent in the dissolution of biomass and its derived components,
namely cellulose, hemicellulose, disaccharides, and monosaccharides.7,34,36 When we attempted the separation
of glucose from [Emim][acetate] using DCM as an antisolvent, the glucose
removal (55%) and IL recovery (40%) percentages were found to be lower
because of the strong interactions between [Emim][acetate] and glucose.
In the separation of sugars from IL, the interaction between sugar
and IL also plays a significant role (lower IDAC values). The solubility
of the investigated sugars in [Emim][acetate] is higher than that
in other ILs (Figure S2). Thus, the recovery
of sugars and the [Emim][acetate] IL is lower. Figure S2 represents the predicted logarithmic IDAC of 11
sugars in 27 different ILs. Another set of ILs, namely, amino acid-based
ILs, have shown higher interactions or solubility with sugars (Figure S2), which could lead to the solubilization
of the biomass as well. Therefore, the amino acid-based ILs are selected
for the screening study. It should be noted that the experimental
solubility data for the investigated sugars are absent in the amino
acid-based ILs. Further, the synthesis of amino acid-based ILs was
economically not easy, which is the reason they were omitted. This
is the very reason that the next set of ILs ([Emim][EtSO4], [Emim][SCN], and [Emim][MeSO3]) was used for the separation
process.

It is also a fact that the selected ILs have already
proven to be the best in the dissolution of sugars.20,22,34,37 For the COSMO-RS
screening study, the sugars, namely monosaccharides, disaccharides,
and sugar alcohols are selected for separation from ILs. In the sugar
separation process, the monosaccharides and sugar alcohols are difficult
to recover as compared to the disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and
polysaccharides, owing to their higher solubility in ILs. From the
results of Carneiro et al. (2014), the removal percentage of the disaccharide,
that is, sucrose is ≥93–99%, whereas the removal percentages
of glucose and fructose are 8–75.3% and 5.3–90%, respectively.26 Therefore, we have given more attention for
the recovery of monomeric sugars from ILs. The equilibrium solubility
data of sugars in the respective ILs are taken from previous literature
(Figure S1), except for the glucose–[Emim][MeSO3] system. The solubility of glucose in [Emim][MeSO3] was measured at 298.15 K (Table 1). Table 1 reports the percentage of IL recovered (% ILR) and percentage of
carbohydrate removal (% CR) with different sugar–IL–antisolvent
mixtures at 298.15 K and with different antisolvent to IL molar ratios
(Rantisolvent). From Table 1, it
can be observed that the solubility of fructose was higher than that
of other sugars. This solubility difference was attributed to the
difference in the phase transition properties (such as melting temperature
and heat of fusion values) of sugars. Lower the melting temperature
and heat of fusion value, higher will be the solubility of the solute
in the respective solvents.20,22 The melting properties
of the investigated sugars are reported in the Supporting Information, Table S2.

Effect of Antisolvent to
IL Molar Ratio in Sugar Separation
The effect of the antisolvent
to IL molar ratio in sugar separation
was studied by varying from 5 to 20, which is shown in Table 1. From Table 1 (for glucose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM and glucose–[Emim][SCN]/DCM), the recovery and removal
percentage of ILs and carbohydrates were found to increase with the
increase in the antisolvent to IL molar ratio. In the recovery of
IL, a significant difference was observed with the increase in the
antisolvent molar ratio. At higher antisolvent molar ratio (R = 20), the recovery of [Emim][EtSO4] was about
93% for the glucose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM system. In
the case of carbohydrate removal percentage, the difference in % CR
was minor, that is, 98–99% from R = 10 to
20. As expected, higher the molar ratio of the antisolvent to IL,
lower will be the solubility of the carbohydrate in the mixtures.

According to the results of Carneiro et al. (2014), a further increase
in the antisolvent molar ratio (R > 20) did not
show
a significant effect in the recovery and removal percentages of both
IL and the carbohydrate.26 It was also
reported that for the case of ethanol as an antisolvent, a lower molar
ratio is preferable, as the solubility of carbohydrate in pure ethanol
is higher as compared with that in DCM, acetonitrile, and DCE. Therefore,
in the solubility aspects, R should not be too high
as it may lead to a lower carbohydrate removal. For this purpose,
ethanol can only be used as an antisolvent at lower molar ratios,
that is, R < 3, for efficient carbohydrate removal.26 Therefore, the optimum value of R should be a balance between the separation performance and antisolvent
loading. Thus, R = 20 was considered as the optimal
molar ratio for the separation of carbohydrates from ILs.

For
further investigations, three important phases are involved
in the experimental design for the separation of sugars from ILs.
In the first phase, the separation experiments are performed with
ILs [Emim][EtSO4] and [Emim][SCN] in the presence of the
DCM antisolvent with four different sugars. This step provides the
effect of sugar removal with different sugars in the separation process.
In the second phase, the IL [Emim][MeSO3] was tested with
glucose in the DCM antisolvent to understand the effect of the third
IL. Finally, to understand the effect of different antisolvents, two
different antisolvents, namely, DCM and DCE, were tested for four
different sugars using [Emim][EtSO4] at R = 20. Hence, to avoid all the combinations, the representative combinations
were chosen.

Effect of Different Sugars
The effects
of different
sugars such as glucose, xylose, fructose, and galactose were studied
in [Emim][EtSO4] and [Emim][SCN] with DCM as an antisolvent.
As can be seen from Table 1, the recovery percentage of ILs in the galactose-based system
was higher than that of the other sugars. This is mainly due to the
weaker interactions and lower solubility of galactose in ILs. Galactose
exhibits higher melting properties than other sugars which lead to
lower solubility. It should be noted that the lower solubility of
a solute in the solvent causes weaker interactions. On the contrary,
the recovery percentage of ILs in fructose-based systems was lower
than that of other sugars. This is due to the lower melting properties
of fructose (Table S2) which lead to higher
solubility. Therefore, the higher solubility of sugar in IL yielded
a less percentage of IL recovery (see Table 1).

Further, the recovery percentage
of [Emim][EtSO4] and [Emim][SCN] ILs with the mixture of
different sugars was also assessed. Except for the glucose-based system,
the recovery percentage of [Emim][EtSO4] IL was found to
be higher than that of [Emim][SCN] at R = 20 (Table 1). The solubility
of carbohydrates in [Emim][SCN] was lower than that in [Emim][EtSO4] because of the weaker interactions between the carbohydrates
and [Emim][SCN]. Despite this fact, the recovery percentage of [Emim][EtSO4] in DCM was higher when compared to that of [Emim][SCN] because
of the disturbance in the hydrogen-bonding network between the carbohydrates
and [Emim][EtSO4] (see Table S3). As can be seen from Table S3, with
the addition of an antisolvent to the sugar–IL system, the
H bonding and interaction energy (IE) values were found to be significantly
decreased. Furthermore, the activity coefficient of [Emim][EtSO4] in DCM is also lower than that of [Emim][SCN] (Table 2). This leads to a
higher miscibility of [Emim][EtSO4] in DCM, resulting in
a higher recovery percentage.

5	fructose	7.50	11.46	
6	xylose	7.32	10.76	
7	galactose	7.16	11.94	
On the other hand, the removal percentage of glucose
was higher
than that of other sugars, even though glucose exhibits lower melting
properties than galactose. Here, the COSMO-RS results also suggested
that the ln γ values of glucose in the DCM and DCE antisolvents
are higher than those of other sugars (i.e., as per Table 2, higher the IDAC value, lower
are the interactions). Further observations from Table 1 showed that the removal of
xylose was lower than that of fructose, although fructose had higher
solubility in ILs. This is due to the fact that two parameters actually
effect the removal of carbohydrates from ILs, that is, the sugar–IL
and sugar–antisolvent interactions. If the sugar–IL
interactions are weaker and the sugar–antisolvent interactions
are stronger, it leads to a lower removal of carbohydrate. Thus, lower
the IE value, lesser is the removal of sugar. Xylose has weaker interactions
with ILs and stronger interactions with the antisolvents (Table 2) as compared to fructose.
Therefore, xylose achieved a lower removal percentage.

Effect of Different
ILs
ILs such as [Emim][EtSO4], [Emim][SCN], and
[Emim][MeSO3] were used to
separate glucose from a mixture in the presence of DCM as an antisolvent.
The ILs [Emim][MeSO3] and [Emim][EtSO4] gave
higher solubility (xsugar) of glucose
at 298.15 K in the studied systems, indicating that these ILs have
a strong dissolving capacity for glucose. However, [Emim][SCN] has
a higher recovery percentage as compared to the other two ILs when
they were mixed with glucose in the presence of DCM. On the other
hand, the COSMO-RS results suggest that [Emim][MeSO3] and
[Emim][EtSO4] have lower activity coefficient values in
DCM as compared to [Emim][SCN] (Table 2), resulting in a lower recovery percentage of IL.
This is due to the fact that [Emim][MeSO3] and [Emim][EtSO4] have strong interactions with glucose than DCM. Therefore,
the recovery percentages of [Emim][MeSO3] and [Emim][EtSO4] were lower than that of [Emim][SCN], whereas in the case
of glucose removal percentage, it does not have a general trend. A
lower removal percentage of glucose was obtained in [Emim][MeSO3] because of the higher solubility of glucose. However, the
percentage of glucose removal in all the three different ILs gave
a similar value (∼97–99%).

Effect of Different Antisolvents
Two different antisolvents,
namely DCM and DCE were tested for the experimental separation of
four different sugars from [Emim][EtSO4] at R = 20. From Table 1, it was observed that there is a remarkable difference on the ability
of the antisolvents in the recovery of [Emim][EtSO4] from
these mixtures. As compared with the recovery percentage of [Emim][EtSO4] in both antisolvents, a significant difference was not observed
in the removal of carbohydrates. The results from Table 1 indicate that the recovery
percentage of [Emim][EtSO4] was higher in DCM as compared
with that in the DCE antisolvent. This may be due to the higher interaction
between [Emim][EtSO4] and DCM. On the other hand, the removal
percentage of carbohydrate was higher in DCE when compared to that
in DCM. This ascription was attained because of the weaker interactions
between the carbohydrates and DCE, which cause a lower solubility
of carbohydrates in the DCE antisolvent.

It should be noted
that the investigated antisolvents DCM and DCE are not environmentally
benign as compared to ethanol. However, the separation of these antisolvents
from the IL phase can be easily performed by using distillation at
a lower pressure. However, when ethanol is used as an antisolvent
in the separation of carbohydrates from ILs, the removal percentage
of carbohydrates is lower because of the higher interactions between
ethanol and carbohydrates.26 Recently,
Hassan et al. (2013) performed the glucose dissolution in different
ILs and further extracted glucose from ILs using the antisolvent method
with different antisolvents.35 Glucose
(80%) was extracted from [Emim][SCN] in the presence of ethanol as
an antisolvent, whereas in the case of acetonitrile, 90% of glucose
was extracted from [Emim][SCN] at R = 20. In our
case, 97.3 and 99.23% of glucose were recovered from [Emim][SCN] with
the DCM antisolvent at R = 10 and 20, respectively,
whereas for ethanol, at R = 10, 37.15% of glucose
was recovered.

In another study, Carneiro et al. (2014) investigated
the separation
of carbohydrates from ILs using an antisolvent method.26 They reported a recovery of 5.3% of fructose
from [Emim][EtSO4] and 8.1% of glucose from [Emim][TFA]
when using ethanol as an antisolvent (at R = 20).
Moreover, when acetone and acetonitrile were used as antisolvents,
67 and 76.7% of fructose were recovered from [Emim][EtSO4], respectively. On the other hand, when DCM and DCE were used as
antisolvents, 90% of fructose and 99% of glucose were extracted from
[Emim][EtSO4], respectively. Further, our COSMO-RS predictions
(Figures 2 and 4) also prove the fact that the lower ln γ
value of sugars in ethanol results in a higher solubility of sugar
in ethanol. Therefore, in the present study, DCM and DCE solvents
have been used to separate carbohydrates from ILs.

on the separation of glucose and [Emim][SCN]
in the presence of DCM at R = 20.

Effect of Temperature on Sugar Separation
Furthermore,
the effect of temperature in the separation of glucose from the [Emim][SCN]/DCM
(at R = 20) mixture was studied at different temperatures
(298.15, 303.15, and 313.15 K). As can be seen from Figure 4, the recovery percentage of
[Emim][SCN] and the removal percentage of glucose were found to decrease
with increasing temperature. An increase of temperature will promote
the molecular thermal motion of the entire system and the volatility
of the nonvolatile solute, resulting in an increase in the solubility
of glucose in the [Emim][SCN]/DCM mixtures. Hence, low temperature
is favorable for the separation of carbohydrates from ILs. A similar
observation was also reported by Liu et al. (2011)34 during their study on the extraction of glucose from different
ILs using ethanol as an antisolvent.

Results of MD Simulations
Apart from the experimental
evidence, the MD simulations were also carried out to understand the
structural properties of carbohydrates with ILs and antisolvents via
IEs, average hydrogen bonding (hydrogen bonds (HBs)), and coordination
numbers (CN). For the MD simulation system, the carbohydrates, namely, glucose,
xylose, and fructose are considered. Figure S3 shows the optimized geometries of glucose, xylose, fructose, [Emim]+, anions, and two antisolvents (DCM and DCE).

Nonbonded IE
The MD-simulated nonbonded IE is the sum
of the electrostatic and van der Waals energies. Table 3 reports the IEs of glucose
with three different IL–antisolvent mixtures at 298.15 K and R = 20. The IE results of glucose are compared with the
other two carbohydrate systems, namely, xylose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM and fructose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM.

Interactions of Different IL–Antisolvents
with Glucose
The nonbonded IEs of anions, [Emim]+, and antisolvents
with glucose were computed, as shown in Table 3. As can be seen from Table 3, the anions possessed
a higher IE with glucose and DCM when compared to the [Emim]+ cation. This higher IE is obtained because of the formation of a
stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the glucose–anion
(1.75 Å) and anion–DCM (≤2.15 Å) pairs (Figure S4). For the glucose–[Emim]+, glucose–DCM, and [Emim]+–DCM systems,
the intermolecular distances were found within the range of 2.20–3.05
Å (Figure S4), indicating a weak HB
formation. Therefore, it reveals that the anionic part of the IL plays
a predominating role as compared to the cation. The IE between glucose
and [Emim][MeSO3] was found to be higher than that between
glucose and [Emim][EtSO4] and glucose and [Emim][SCN].
From the experimental data, the solubility of glucose (x) was reported to be higher in [Emim][MeSO3] than in the
other two ILs (Table 1). A similar result was reflected in their IEs, that is, higher the
IE value, higher is the solubility. However, the removal percentage
of glucose was lower in [Emim][MeSO3] (96%) because of
the stronger IE between glucose and [Emim][MeSO3]. Further,
the IE between glucose and DCM was higher in the glucose–[Emim][MeSO3]/DCM system; as a result, the recovery of glucose was lower.
Therefore, the IE between glucose and IL and that between glucose
and DCM is crucial in the removal of glucose from IL. On the other
hand, the removal percentage of glucose was higher in [Emim][SCN]
(99.23%) because of lower solubility and weaker interactions between
glucose and [Emim][SCN] and glucose and DCM (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Effect of different ILs on the recovery of glucose
from ILs in
sugar–IL separations by using the DCM antisolvent at 298.15
K and R = 20. (a) MD-simulated IEs and (b) experimental
% ILR and % CR.

Furthermore, on comparing
the IL recoveries, the recovery percentage
of [Emim][SCN] was higher than the other two ILs. It was also noted
that the recovery percentage of [Emim][SCN] was found to be higher
than that of [Emim][EtSO4] at R = 10 and
20. According to the definition, the antisolvent should be miscible
or marginally miscible with IL. However, the IE between [Emim][SCN]
and DCM was weaker as compared to that between [Emim][EtSO4] and DCM and [Emim][MeSO3] and DCM (Figure 5). The recovery of [Emim][EtSO4] and [Emim][MeSO3] was lower because of the stronger
IE between glucose and [Emim][MeSO3] and glucose and [Emim][EtSO4] (see Figure 5). Hence, the IE between glucose and IL and IL and antisolvent has
a dominating influence on the recovery of IL. It was also worthwhile
to note that higher the difference in IE between IL and sugar and
IL and antisolvent, higher is the recovery percentage of IL. The magnitude
of difference in IE between glucose–[Emim][SCN] and [Emim][SCN]–DCM
(−67.55 kJ mol–1) is higher than [Emim][EtSO4] and [Emim][MeSO3] (−61.73 and −41.60
kJ mol–1). Therefore,
the recovery of [Emim][SCN] is higher than that of [Emim][EtSO4].

In addition, the effects of the antisolvent (DCM
and DCE) interactions
on glucose–[Emim][EtSO4] were also investigated
and are shown in Table 3 and Figure 5. From Figure 5, it is seen that
the recovery of [Emim][EtSO4] in DCM was higher as compared
with that in DCE. It is due to the stronger interactions between [Emim][EtSO4] and the DCM antisolvent. On the other hand, the higher removal
percentage of glucose was found in the DCE antisolvent. It should
be noted that DCE possessed a lower IE (−27.80 kJ mol–1) with glucose when compared to DCM (−31.02 kJ mol–1). Even though the difference between the IEs is −3.22 kJ
mol–1, it highly alters the glucose removal percentage
from [Emim][EtSO4].

From Table 3, it
is noted that higher the difference in IEs between IL and sugar and
that between IL and the antisolvent, higher is the recovery percentage
of IL. However, a contrary trend is obtained for the sugar removal
percentage. Here, as the energy difference between IL and sugar and
that between sugar and antisolvent decreases, the removal percentage
of sugar is found to increase for [Emim][SCN], [Emim][EtSO4], and [Emim][MeSO3] with the DCM antisolvent. For the
systems with [Emim][EtSO4]–DCM and [Emim][EtSO4]–DCE, the energy difference between IL and glucose
and that between glucose and antisolvent increases with an increasing
removal percentage of glucose. This attribution may be due to the
difference in the physiochemical properties of the antisolvents.

IEs of Different Sugars with [Emim][EtSO4]/DCM
The IEs of glucose, xylose, and fructose with [Emim][EtSO4]/DCM are reported in Table 3 and shown in Figure 6. The IL recovery and sugar removal percentage were higher
in glucose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM as compared with the
xylose- and fructose-based systems (Figure 6). The IE between fructose and IL (−120.35
kJ mol–1) was much stronger than that between xylose
and IL (−79.05 kJ mol–1) and glucose and
IL (−61.87 kJ mol–1), which leads to a higher
removal percentage of glucose (98.60%). Further, it should be noted
that higher the IE between the molecules, stronger is the formation
of HBs between them. This makes it difficult to disturb the HBs formed
between them. In addition, the IE difference between glucose and [Emim][EtSO4] and that between glucose and DCM is lower than that between
fructose and xylose, whereas in the case of IL recovery percentage,
the IE difference between the sugar and [Emim][EtSO4] and
that between [Emim][EtSO4] and DCM is lower in the fructose-based
system (3.04 kJ mol–1) than in the xylose (−51.63
kJ mol–1)- and glucose (−61.73 kJ mol–1)-based systems (see Figure 6). Consequently, the recovery percentage
of IL was less in the fructose-based system because of their lower
interaction between IL and DCM and stronger interaction between fructose
and IL.

IL–sugar separations by using the antisolvent method at 298.15

Hydrogen Bonding and CN
Table 4 reports
the average number of HBs per glucose
and IL molecule established between sugar–IL–antisolvent.
The criteria for the calculation of HBs are as follows: the distance
between the acceptor and donor molecules is kept at 3.2 Å, and
the cutoff angle for acceptor–H–donor is 120°.
For reliability, we have used the same distance and angle for all
simulated systems. Table 4 also reports the CN and the total nonbonded IE between the
simulated molecules. From Table 4, it is observed that the average number of HBs formed
was higher with increasing CN. However, this trend excludes the [Emim]+–sugar and [Emim]+–antisolvent systems.
It should be noted that HB and CN are two different descriptors. HBs
are a type of dipole–dipole interactions formed between the
proton of a donor group X–H (X: electronegative atom) and one
or more other electronegative atoms (Y) having a pair of nonbonded
electrons.38,39 CN is computed from the integration
of radial distribution function (RDF) peaks and provides an estimate
of the number of molecules in the surrounding environment of the reference
molecule. In these calculations, along with the height and width of
the RDF peaks, the density of the system is also accounted.40,41 Therefore, HB and CN in Table 4 do not provide a direct correlation.

From Table 4, it
is observed that the anion of IL forms a higher number of HBs with
the sugar molecule than either the cation of IL or the antisolvent.
Contrary to HBs, the CN between the anion and antisolvent is higher
than that between the anion and sugar molecules. This is due to the
fact that the cutoff distance between the acceptor and donor molecules
is only 3.2 Å. On the other hand, the first solvation peak for
anion–sugar was obtained at around 2.35–2.65 Å,
whereas in the case of anion–antisolvent, the solvation peak
was attained at 3.45–3.75 Å (see Table 4). Furthermore, the anions possess a higher
IE with the sugar molecules as a result of the stronger HBs formed
between the anion and sugar molecules. It is interesting to note that
in the DCE-based system, the IE between the cation and antisolvent
is higher than that in the DCM-based system. Nevertheless, DCE-based
systems had lower H-bonding and CN values than the DCM-based systems
(Table 4). The trend
is due to the lower electrostatic interactions of [Emim]+–DCE. The IE, average HBs, and CNs for glucose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM was lower than those for xylose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM and fructose–[Emim][EtSO4]/DCM, which
revealed a higher recovery of IL and glucose. Furthermore, a close
look at Table S3 reveals that the IE between
IL and sugar is much stronger in a pure IL–sugar system. However,
with the addition of antisolvent to the sugar–IL system, the
H-bonding and IE values were lowered. In summary, the antisolvent
was indeed efficient in disturbing the hydrogen-bonding network between
the carbohydrates and IL.

Correlation between Theoretical and Experimental
Separation
Data
Figure 7 depicts the relationship between the predicted activity coefficient
(COSMO-RS), MD-simulated IE, and experimental fructose removal from
[Emim][EtSO4] in the presence of different antisolvents.
The experimental separation data for [Emim][EtSO4]/ethanol
and [Emim][EtSO4]/acetonitrile were taken from the literature.26 From Figure 7, it is observed that an increase in IE between fructose
and antisolvent lowers the removal percentage of fructose. The higher
IE between the molecules leads to a higher solubility of solute in
the solvent. The COSMO-RS calculations suggest that lower the ln γ
value, lower is the removal of fructose (Figure 7). It was reported that the solubility of
monomeric sugars in ethanol was higher as compared to that in DCM
and acetonitrile.34 Therefore, the removal
percentage of fructose was less in ethanol as compared to that in
the other two antisolvents. Overall, this agrees well with the sugar
removal, but fails in few cases for IL recovery. In Table S4, DCM shows a lower ln γ value with [Emim][EtSO4] than with ethanol and acetonitrile, as DCM gave less recovery
of IL. This is mainly attributed to the fact that although COSMO-RS
predictions are performed on an IL–antisolvent mixture only,
it neglects the presence of sugar. Hence, the predicted activity coefficient
follows a separate trend. On the contrary, the MD simulations are
conducted with the entire mixture, namely, the sugar–IL/antisolvent,
and the IEs showed a good correlation with the experimental recovery
(Table S4). Further, to elucidate the strength
of the HBs formed between fructose and antisolvents, separate quantum
chemical calculations have been performed and are presented in the Supporting Information.

predicted activity coefficient (COSMO-RS),

data for ethanol and acetonitrile were taken from Carneiro et al.
(2014).26

Conclusions
In the current study, 35 antisolvents were
screened by the COSMO-RS
model for the separation of sugars and ILs by means of the precipitation
process. From the COSMO-RS screening study, DCM and DCE were found
to be the efficient antisolvents for the separation process. Thereafter,
the precipitation experiments were conducted with the selected antisolvents
for the separation of four different sugars from ILs at different
process variables. From the experimental results, 90–99% of
carbohydrate removal and 80–98% of IL recovery were achieved
with the DCM antisolvent at an optimal antisolvent molar ratio (R = 20). At higher temperatures, the recovery percentage
of [Emim][SCN] and the removal of glucose were found to decrease.
Hence, low temperature is favorable for the separation of carbohydrates
from ILs. Furthermore, MD simulations were performed to elucidate
the structural properties of carbohydrates with the IL–antisolvent
mixtures. The IE between glucose and IL was found to be weaker than
that between xylose and IL and fructose and IL. This led to a higher
removal percentage of glucose than xylose and fructose. The higher
the difference in IE between IL and sugar and that between IL and
antisolvent, higher is the recovery percentage of IL. A higher removal
percentage of glucose was also found in the DCE antisolvent. DCE possessed
a lower IE (−27.80 kJ mol–1) with glucose
when compared to DCM (−31.02 kJ mol–1). The
IEs between carbohydrate and IL and that between carbohydrate and
antisolvent hence have a dominating influence on the removal of carbohydrate
from IL. Overall, a higher IE (MD) and lower activity coefficient
(COSMO-RS) yield a lower removal of carbohydrates (experimental).
In summary, these results prove that the usage of the DCM antisolvent
for the separation of carbohydrates from ILs is feasible.

Computational
Details
COSMO-RS Model
COSMO-RS is a quantum chemical-based
solvation model which can be used for screening of a large number
of solvents or potential cation and anion combinations in ILs. The
model can be used to predict the activity coefficient and chemical
potential of any solute in the mixture. It requires the chemical structure
of the component as the only information.42,43 Initially, the structures of sugars, antisolvents (organic solvents),
anions, and cations were drawn with the help of Avogadro freeware
software.44 The molecular geometries of
all molecules were fully optimized by B3LYP/6-31G* via Gaussian09
package.37,45 After molecular geometry optimization, the
next step is to generate the COSMO file using the SCRF = COSMO-RS
keyword with the final optimized structure. The detailed methodology
of the COSMO-RS calculations is described in our previous work, hence
not discussed here.12,22,37,46

MD Simulations
The microscopic interactions
between
the sugars (glucose, xylose, and fructose) and IL–antisolvent
mixtures were studied by employing the MD simulations. The partial
charges of all the studied molecules were attained by the restrained
electrostatic potential charge derivation method.47 For all the molecules, the generalized AMBER force-field
(GAFF) parameters were employed.48 The
GAFF parameters were developed by Antechamber.49

All the MD simulations were performed with the NAMD
ver2.1050 at constant temperature (298.15
K) and atmospheric pressure using a Langevin thermostat and a Nose–Hoover
Langevin barostat.51,52 The SHAKE algorithm was implemented
to constrain the lengths of all the covalent bonds to hydrogen.53 The Particle Mesh Ewald method was applied to
account for the long-range electrostatic interactions at the cutoff
distance of 12 Å.54 The initial configuration
of the sugar–IL–antisolvents is prepared by PACKMOL
in a cubic box with a random distribution of molecules.55 Initially, the simulation system was minimized
for 1 ns and then gradually heated to its desired temperature (298.15
K) for 0.5 ns. At the desired temperature, the system was then equilibrated
for 10 ns under an isothermal–isobaric ensemble (NPT) to get
the system converge to its experimental condition. Consequently, the
production run lasted for 40 ns with a canonical (NVT) ensemble. At
every 5 ps, the production run data were saved for structural analysis
from the simulated trajectories using VMD software.56 In the mixture of sugar–IL–antisolvent, the
IE and HBs between IL and sugar and those between IL and antisolvent
are calculated per mole of IL, and for the sugar–antisolvent
system, the IE and HBs are calculated per mole of sugar.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose,
xylose, and galactose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the carbohydrates
have purities greater than 99% as per the supplier specification.
The ILs 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate [Emim][SCN] (≥95%),
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate [Emim][EtSO4]
(≥95%), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate [Emim][MeSO3] (≥95%) were supplied from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany.
These chemicals were used without further purification. The antisolvents
such as DCM (≥99.5%) and DCE (≥99.5%) were purchased
from Merck, India.

Separation of Sugars from ILs
The
experimental solubility
data of sugars, namely, glucose, xylose, fructose, and galactose in
[Emim][EtSO4] and [Emim][SCN] were taken from the available
literature where the experiments were conducted at various temperatures
in different ILs. The results are presented in Figures S5 and S6 (Supporting Information).20,22 The saturated solubility data of sugars in ILs ([Emim][EtSO4] and [Emim][SCN]) at 298.15 K are reported in Figure S1 and herein used for the separation
process. The mixture containing sugar + IL was used without any further
pretreatment or drying. For the separation process, the specified
amount of sugar + IL (2 g) mixture with a known composition was mixed
with a desired amount of antisolvent in a 30 mL flask. The flask was
sealed and the mixture was magnetically stirred for 8–10 h
to make sure that all the carbohydrate was precipitated. The precipitation
experiments were conducted at different sugar–IL–antisolvents,
different antisolvent to IL molar ratios (R = 5,
10, 15, 20), and temperatures. All the experiments were performed
in duplicate.

After precipitation, the carbohydrates were collected
by vacuum filtration and dried at 45 °C for 48 h. Subsequently,
the vacuum-filtrated liquid portion was collected, and the solution
was submitted to evaporation of antisolvent by heating to its boiling
point and continued till the constant weight of IL was achieved. The
recovered IL fraction was weighed and the final concentration of carbohydrates
in IL was measured by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis as described in our previous work.41 The final liquid solution was filtered with a 0.2 μm nylon
membrane filter paper (diameter: 25 mm, purchased from Axiva, India)
through a 0.22 μm syringe filter prior to HPLC analysis. The
quantitative estimation of carbohydrates was achieved by HPLC (PerkinElmer
Series 200, USA) with the Hi-Plex H column (7.7 × 300 mm) connected
to the guard column (Agilent, USA). The column oven temperature was
kept at 65 °C with 0.5 mL min–1 flow rate.
The samples were analyzed with a refractive index detector using 0.01
M H2SO4 as the mobile phase. The sampling and
quantification of the liquid phase were performed in triplicate, and
the average values are reported here. The % CR was calculated according
to the following equation 1  where, m0 and mf are the mass of the
initial sample (IL + sugar)
and mass of the recovered IL, respectively. C0 and Cf are the concentrations
of sugar in the initial and recovered IL, respectively. The % ILR
is defined as 2
