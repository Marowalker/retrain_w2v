We describe a rapid electrophoresis-based
method for profiling
of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. In addition to the pharmacophore
moiety intended for reversible interaction with a target enzyme, a
fluorescent template with a built-in azide group for photoaffinity
labeling is also included as a part of the inhibitor design. Following
incubation and irradiation, gel electrophoresis with visualization
under UV allows assessment of the efficiency of cross-linking. The
relative efficiency of cross-linking of various probes can be regarded
as a reflection of their inhibition potencies, an assumption supported
by the trend in their IC50/Ki values. The method has the advantage of being applicable to impure
enzyme preparations and also can be used to screen several inhibitors
including their promiscuity in parallel in a short time as has been
currently demonstrated with HCA II.

Introduction
Identification of target
receptors/enzymes whose over- or underexpression
is often correlated with a disease plays a primary role in the drug
discovery process.1 Once the target is
identified, the classical screening can be performed for small-molecule
libraries against a purified form of these receptors or enzymes using
in vitro assays.2 However, this approach
usually provides little information about target selectivity and interaction
with potential off-targets in a complex proteomic mixture present
in the system (Figure 1). It would be more convenient if the assay can be carried out in
whole cell lysates, which not only provides information about the
affinity of the small molecule substrates toward the protein but also
reveals any off-target interactions. In this respect, affinity-guided
targeting of a protein of interest in a mixture has emerged as a viable
technique.3 In the 1960s,4 affinity-guided probes have a long history since their
inception. The technology was recently applied for the identification
of irreversible inhibitors by Bogyo and co-workers5 using radio-labeled probes and a subsequent electrophoresis-based
assay. This rapid screening approach resulted in the identification
of a cathepsin B-selective inhibitor.6

Figure 1 Classical
method of potential inhibitor screening of a mixture of proteins
A, B, C, and D.

More recently, Li et
al.7 used activity-based
protein profiling (ABPP) for competitive profiling to screen libraries
of carbamates as irreversible inhibitors of uncharacterized serine
hydrolases. Subsequently, Cravatt et al.8 have successfully applied the completive affinity-based technique
for screening of reversible inhibitors using a competitive fluorescent
rhodamine-based assay (Figure 2). The advantage of this method is that promiscuous inhibitors
lacking
specificity can be readily rejected without any further processing.
The method, though ingenious and novel, can be technically challenging
as it requires previous knowledge of the kinetics of binding.

Figure 2 Cravatt’s
strategy for screening of reversible inhibitors.

Figure 3 Strategy for inhibitor screening described in this paper.

A comparatively straightforward method would be
to have a fluorescent
photo-cross-linker part (acting as a reporter) included in the inhibitor
design by attaching it to a possible pharmacophore. In that case,
the reversible enzyme–inhibitor complex can be permanently
bonded to the target enzyme via photoirradiation. Subsequent gel electrophoresis
of the photo-cross-linking experiment followed by visualization, for
example, under UV and using Coomassie blue, should indicate the efficacy
of the inhibitor. However, one issue could be the combined size of
the fluorophore and the photo-cross-linker, which may weaken the binding.
For this not to happen, one needs to use a photoaffinity group-embedded
fluorescent label of smaller steric size as compared to the frequently
used ones like rhodamine/fluorescein (Figure 3). To have a minimal effect of the reporter
moiety on the pharmacophore activity, this has been kept apart by
a linker of optimized length (reported earlier9) with three methylene groups. Keeping this in mind, we have designed
and synthesized a series of naphthalimide–aryl sulfonamide
hybrids (1–11) and have shown that
it is possible to compare their relative inhibition potencies by their
relative cross-linking efficiencies. The method is validated by doing
the cross-linking experiment against a control compound (vide infra)
as well as by comparison of IC50/Ki values. The design, synthesis, and screening of potential
inhibitors are described in this paper in detail.

Results and Discussion
Our starting point was the recently described9 linker-based azidonaphthalimide template, which serves
three functions simultaneously. It has the in-built photo-cross-linker
in the form of an azide, a less sterically bulky naphthalimide moiety
as a fluorescence template, and a variable linker ending up in the
carboxylic acid functionality. This 3-in-1 template has been shown
to considerably improve the utility of template-based affinity probes.
It could be easily connected to the selectivity hands that are potential
reversible binders of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II)10 or penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).11 We were able to detect the presence of these
enzymes in the presence of other proteins as well as in cell lysates.

To expand the scope of this 3-in-1 template, we attached various
zinc binding motifs such as sulfonamide and its derivatives, carboxamide,
terpyridine, and hydroxamate to produce the inhibitor molecules (structures 1–11 as shown in Figure 4). Our design was also inspired by the report
by Supuran et al.12 of excellent inhibition
shown by a naphthalimide–sulfonamide hybrid (12) (Ki in a low nanomolar level). As a
positive control for our photo-cross-linking studies, we synthesized
the azido version (13) of Supuran’s molecule.

inhibitors.

Synthesis of the target
inhibitors started with the GABA-attached
azido naphthalimide as depicted in Scheme 1. Sulfonamides 1–5 and 7–9 and carboxamide 6 were synthesized by esterification with the corresponding
bromoacylated derivatives. Hydroxamate 11 was prepared
via nucleophilic displacement of the ethyl ester with free hydroxylamine.13 For the synthesis of terpyridine derivative 10, the 4-methyl phenyl terpyridine was first brominated,14 which was then esterified with the GABA-naphthalimide
carboxylic acid. The control compound 13 was prepared
via direct imide formation from azidonaphthalic anhydride and aminomethyl
benzene 4-sulfonamide. All the compounds were isolated by simple crystallization
from hexane ethyl acetate and were fully characterized by NMR and
HRMS analysis (included in the Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Potential Inhibitors
With the target compounds in hand, we then proceeded to
investigate
their photo-cross-linking ability for HCA II. The enzyme (at a fixed
concentration) was incubated for 15 min with each compound (20 μM)
separately and then photoirradiated (30 min). The irradiated mixture
was then subjected to gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions.
The gel was first visualized under UV and then stained with Coommassie
blue. In both cases, the results were documented and then analyzed
by Image J software.15 The gel pictures
and the relative efficiency of cross-linking are shown in Figure 5.

HCA II cross-linked with the final compounds.

compound (20 μM) has been used in each respective lane. (B)

cross-linking efficiencies of the control compound 13 and the two analogous compounds 2 and 3. Bottom: Image J analysis of the gel picture at the top.

Analysis of the gel pictures along with an overall
image analysis
clearly shows that all the 4-substituted benzene sulfonamides (1–3) showed the highest and also similar
(considering the error range of ±5%) cross-linking efficiencies
when compared with the control compound 13 (Figure 5C). Interestingly,
the 3-aminosulfonamide
(4) behaves similarly to the 4-susbtituted derivatives.
Except for the benzoyl sulfonamide (8), which showed
low but perceptible cross-linking efficiency, all other compounds
including the 2-aminosulfonamide (5) showed insignificant
cross-linking.

To check the selectivity and any off-targets,
compounds 3 and 4 were incubated with the
lysate of Escherechia coli cells overexpressed
with HCA II.16 Sulfonamide 3 was found to be selective,
while sulfonamide 4 was found to cross-link with other
proteins to a significant extent (comparison of lanes 2 and 3 in Figure 6).

Figure 6 Cross-linking of compounds 3 and 4 with
cell lysate. Lane 1: molecular weight marker. Lane 2: compound 4. Lane 3: compound 3. The gel picture was taken
under UV and then stained with Coomassie blue. The amount of compound
used in each lane is 20 μM.

To validate the results based on cross-linking, we determined
the
IC50 values of some of the compounds with strong and weak
photo-cross-linking activity and compared these with those of the
reference compound 13. The IC50 values (shown
along with the curves in Figure 7) also follow the same order as that observed from
the gel-based assay. The Ki values for
compound 3 showing the highest cross-linking efficiency
were compared with those of compounds 5 and 6 with insignificant cross-linking. The trend remains similar. Incidentally,
the reference compound 13 having a similar cross-linking
efficiency to that observed for 3 also has a nanomolar Ki value (table in Figure 7).

Figure 7 Determination of IC50 and Ki values of some key compounds.

In conclusion, the present method offers a rapid
way of initial
screening of potential inhibitors, and based on the efficiency of
photo-cross-linking, compounds can be selected for proceeding further,
and weakly cross-linked or promiscuous inhibitors showing lack of
selectivity can be discarded. To check whether the fluorescent photoreactive
template works for other enzymes, derivatives with an appropriate
selectivity functionality were made to target the penicillin-binding
protein (PBP), metallo-β-lactamases like NDMs, and the fatty
acid dehydratase enzymes HadAB and HadBC. In all cases, we could detect
successful cross-linking demonstrating that the template has little
effect on the binding efficiency of the selectivity hand. While the
details of successful cross-linking with PBP and NDMs have already
been published,9,17 the cross-linking results with
other enzymes will be reported after more elaborative studies.

Experimental
Section
General Procedure
All the reactions under an inert
atmosphere were conducted with oven-dried glassware with anhydrous
solvents dried using standard methods and purified by distillation
prior to use. All common reagents were of commercial grade unless
otherwise specified. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed
on aluminum-backed plates coated with Silica gel 60. A locally available
ultraviolet light chamber was used as the TLC spot indicator. All
new compounds were characterized using 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The NMR spectra
were recorded using Bruker 400 MHz and 600 MHz spectrometers. Proton
and carbon spectra were referenced internally to solvent signals using
values of δ = 2.50 for proton and δ = 39.52 for carbon
(middle peak) in DMSO-d6, of δ =
7.26 for proton and δ = 77.16 for carbon (middle peak) in chloroform-d, and of δ = 2.05 for proton and δ = 206.26
and 29.84 for carbon (middle peak) in acetone-d6. The following abbreviations have been used for NMR peak
assignments: s = singlet, bs = broad singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet,
p = pentet, m = multiplet, and dd = double of doublet. All biochemical
experiments have been done as described in our previous papers.18,17

Preparation of GABA-Carboxylic Acid (14)
The
procedure for preparation of the GABA-carboxylic acid derivative
is same as that reported earlier.9 To a
solution of 4-azido-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (0.05 g, 0.2 mmol) in
dry ethanol (7 mL), DMAP (0.002 g, 0.02 mmol) was added and stirred
for 10 min. 4-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) (0.272 mmol) was added and
the mixture was refluxed for 12 h. After cooling, the precipitated
yellow solids were separated from the solution, washed with cold ethanol,
and air-dried to furnish the azidonaphthalimide GABA-carboxylic acid.
The compound was reprecipitated from the DCM–hexane mixture
and washed with hexane to get the carboxylic acid as a yellow solid.

General Method for Preparation of the Bromoacetyl Derivative
of Sulfonamides (15–19 and 21–23) and Carboxamide (20)
To a solution of sulfanilamide/carboxamide (0.35 g, 2.03
mmol) in dry THF (10 mL), K2CO3 (0.561 g, 4.06
mmol) was added and stirred for 30 min. It was cooled to 0 °C,
and bromoacetyl chloride (0.2 mL, 2.44 mmol) was added dropwise to
the reaction mixture and was stirred for 30 min at 0 °C. Water
was added, and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (50 mL ×
2), washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and
concentrated in vacuo to get the product as a white crystalline solid.

To a
solution of azidonaphthalimide
GABA-carboxylic acids (0.15 mmol) in dry DMF (5 mL) under N2, anhydrous K2CO3 (0.18 mmol) was added and
