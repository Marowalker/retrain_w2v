Understanding the
release of drugs and contrast agents from nanocarriers
is fundamental in the development of new effective nanomedicines.
However, the commonly used method based on dialysis frequently fails
to quantify the release of molecules poorly soluble in water, and
it is not well-suited for in situ measurements in biological media.
Here, we have developed a new methodology for quantifying the release
of fluorescent molecules from lipid nanocarriers (LNCs) using fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS). LNCs based on nanoemulsion droplets,
encapsulating the hydrophobic Nile red derivative NR668 as a model
cargo, were used. Our studies revealed that the standard deviation
of fluorescence fluctuations in FCS measurements depends linearly
on the dye loading in the nanocarriers, and it is insensitive to the
presence of less-bright molecular emissive species in solution. In
sharp contrast, classical FCS parameters, such as the number and the
brightness of emissive species, are strongly influenced by the fluorescence
of molecular species in solution. Therefore, we propose to use the
standard deviation of fluorescence fluctuations for the quantitative
analysis of dye release from nanocarriers, which is unaffected by
the “parasite” fluorescence of the released dyes or
the auto-fluorescence of the medium. Using this method, we found that
LNCs remain intact in water, whereas in serum medium, they release
their content in a temperature-dependent manner. At 37 °C, the
release was relatively slow reaching 50% only after 6 h of incubation.
The results are corroborated by qualitative observations based on
Förster resonance energy transfer between two different encapsulated
dyes. The developed method is simple because it is only based on the
standard deviation of fluorescence fluctuations and, in principle,
can be applied to nanocarriers of different types.

Introduction
Nanocarriers have attracted a lot of interest
in the last years
because of their possible application as tools for drug delivery,1,2 in vivo imaging, and image-guided surgery.3,4 These
systems include polymer nanoparticles and lipid-based nanocarriers
such as nanoemulsions, liposomes,5 micelles,
and inorganic nanoparticles. Interest in studies of the nanocarrier
behavior is increasing, and a lot of research has been devoted to
novel ways to characterize their properties.6 One of the most important properties is their ability to encapsulate
hydrophobic or hydrophilic molecules, depending on their composition
and morphology.7

Optimal application
of nanocarriers (NCs) in the drug delivery
requires that the drug is maintained inside the nanocarriers until
it reaches the target, such as a tumor, followed by controlled release
of the drug inside the target. The most common method to study the
release of drugs from nanocarriers is dialysis.8 However, it has limitations when applied to highly hydrophobic
drugs poorly soluble in water,9 and it
cannot really be applied to study the release directly in cells and
animals. Other methods such as size-exclusion chromatography, continuous
flow, and flow cytometry have also been used,10 but they have limitations similar to those of dialysis. Therefore,
understanding the drug release requires simple and effective assays
capable to operate directly in situ in complex biological media. Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) is the method of choice in this case.
Several reports have already shown the strong potential of FRET to
study cargo release in biological liquids, cells, and even in living
animals.11−15 However, this method requires double labeling of the nanocarriers
(i.e., with donor and acceptor). Moreover, it is still challenging
to achieve a quantitative characterization of the cargo release using
FRET-based methods, although some calibration-based approaches have
been suggested recently.12

A promising
technique for the characterization of nano-objects
in situ is fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS).16−18 It is a powerful technique used in biological and biophysical research19,20 for investigating fundamental processes such as molecular diffusion,21 particularly in lipid membranes,22,23 and inside the cells,24 interaction of
biomolecules,25,26 and (bio)chemical reactions,17,27,28 with sensitivity reaching single-molecule
level.29 FCS is based on measuring the
fluorescence intensity fluctuations of emissive species diffusing
across a small-excitation focal volume. Autocorrelation analysis of
the fluorescence intensity in the focal volume provides information
on the concentration, diffusion constant, and brightness of the fluorescent
particles. Moreover, analysis of the fluorescence intensity fluctuations
by the so-called fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy enables quantitative
analysis of the brightness distribution, which allows characterization
of heterogeneous samples containing assembled molecules.30,31 FCS serves as a tool for measuring the size32 and polydispersity33 of nanoparticles,
as well as for evaluating their behavior in complex biological media34 and their stability.35,36 Also in many reports, FCS has been used to characterize the formation
of the protein corona on the surface of nanoparticles37−39 or the interaction of human serum albumin with liposomes.40 However, only few studies have reported the
use of FCS to study the release of cargo from nanoparticles. Andresen
et al. used FCS for quantification of leakage of dyes from unilamellar
lipid vesicles,41 proposing a mathematical
framework for the data analysis. In addition, we used FCS to characterize
the leakage of fluorescent dyes from lipid nanoparticles directly
into biological media, but these measurements were performed without
quantification of release processes.11

The aim of our study is to develop a simple FCS-based technique
for the quantification of cargo release from NCs. To this end, we
selected lipid NCs (LNCs), the so-called nanoemulsion droplets (Figure 1). These systems
are composed of substances generally regarded as safe and therefore,
they constitute a promising nontoxic platform for drug delivery.42 However, the liquid nature of their core raises
questions about their stability in vivo and capacity to maintain their
cargo until the target. Our recent work has shown that LNCs can retain
their contents even in vivo and accumulate in tumors in an almost
intact form.12 However, in this case, the
cargo should be sufficiently hydrophobic to remain inside LNCs in
a biological environment.11 Therefore,
LNCs can be a suitable platform for encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs
and contrast agents. In the present work, we explored a possibility
to study by FCS the release from LNCs of a model cargo, hydrophobic
Nile red derivative NR668 (Figure 1). In addition to classical FCS parameters, such as
the number and brightness of the emissive species, we also studied
the standard deviation (SD)43 of fluorescence
fluctuations as a function of dye loading and the degree of dye release.
Remarkably, this SD showed an almost linear dependence on the degree
of the dye release with minimal perturbation by the fluorescent
species outside LNCs. Thus, we propose to use a very simple parameter
of FCS measurements to monitor the release of a fluorescent cargo
directly in situ in a complex biological context.

to solubilize hydrophobic dyes.

Results and Discussion
We first wanted to find conditions
under which the content of LNCs
is released as a function of time. To this end, we used FRET, which
is a well-established technique for studying the stability of nanocarriers.
FRET has been used to follow the integrity of different nanoparticles
in vivo, such as polymeric micelles,13 LNCs,11,12,14,44 and HDL.45 It acts similar to a molecular
ruler46 to monitor the proximity between
the fluorophores inside LNCs, so that FRET is lost as soon as the
dyes are released from the nanocarriers and diluted into the medium.
In our case, NR668 was selected as an energy acceptor, whereas another
highly hydrophobic dye F888 was chosen as an energy donor, as shown
in our earlier report.11 Nanoemulsion droplets
prepared by spontaneous emulsification had a hydrodynamic diameter
of 34 nm and a good polydispersity (<0.1) according to dynamic
light scattering (DLS). The presence of the dyes did not affect the
polydispersity and size of LNCs. An increase in the loading of the
FRET pair resulted in the growth of the relative intensity of the
acceptor emission, which is an indication of FRET (Figure 2A). The highest acceptor to
donor ratio (∼0.75) was obtained for LNCs with 0.5 wt % of
F888 and NR668. This formulation was selected for the release studies.

Figure 2 (A) Fluorescence
spectra of FRET NCs at different concentrations
of donor (F888) and acceptor (NR668), encapsulated at a 1:1 molar
ratio. The black solid line corresponds to LNCs containing only the
donor (1% loading). Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 390 nm excitation
wavelength. Nanoemulsions were diluted to the same absorbance at 390
nm. The dotted line corresponds to the direct excitation of the acceptor
(NR668 only, 1% loading) at 390 nm (the same dilution as for the F888
nanoemulsion). (B) Acceptor to donor intensity ratio as a function
of time, for a mixture of LNCs (0.5 wt % F888-NR668) and 10-fold excess
of blank LNCs for three different temperatures (20, 37, and 60 °C).
Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 3).

The release experiments were performed
in the presence of a 10-time
excess of blank LNCs, which was our model of the recipient medium
for hydrophobic dye molecules. This mixture was incubated at three
different temperatures (20, 37, and 60 °C), and the acceptor
to donor intensity ratio was measured after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h
of incubation. As shown in Figure 2B, at 20 and 37 °C, the acceptor to donor intensity
ratio reflecting the FRET efficiency did not change even after 6 h.
In contrast, at 60 °C, we observed a decrease in this ratio after
the first 30 min, and it continued decreasing during 6 h of the experiment.
This decrease is due to an increase in the distance between the donor
and acceptor, which implies that dyes are released from our FRET LNCs.
These data show that our LNCs can retain the cargo dyes in the release
medium even at 37 °C at least for 6 h, which is in line with
our earlier work performed in serum.11 Moreover,
we found that 60 °C is a convenient model condition generating
dye release on the time scale of hours. However, it is difficult to
directly connect FRET efficiency with the degree of dye leakage, unless
a dedicated model and corresponding calibrations are realized.

Having set up our model release system, we then explored the possibility
to quantify the release of dyes using FCS measurements. Because dye
release should affect the nanodroplet brightness and the quantity
of emissive species in solution,36 FCS
appears as a promising method to quantify this release. Following
this logic, the release of hydrophobic dye into the recipient medium
should result in an increase in the number of emissive species and
a decrease in the particle brightness, as we showed in our earlier
work.11 However, the problem comes when
we do not know much about the biological medium, where the dye is
released. In this case, the fluorescence of the released dyes as well
as the autofluorescence of the medium can alter the measurements of
FCS. To model the effect of the latter, we introduced another fluorescent
dye, calcein, into the external medium. Calcein is highly soluble
and should provide a background fluorescence that models the emission
of the released dye and/or the autofluorescence of the medium. In
one series of experiments, we kept the NR668 loading constant but
increased the calcein concentration, whereas in the second series,
the NR668 loading was increased while keeping the concentration of
calcein constant. An increase in the concentration of calcein would
mimic the release of free dye into the medium, whereas an increase
in the NR668 loading would mimic the changes in the dye content in
LNCs because of dye leakage. For FCS measurements, a two-photon excitation
at 830 nm was used and the emission was collected over the entire
visible spectrum, so that fluorescence signal from both NR668 and
calcein could be recorded. The following FCS parameters were studied:
(i) brightness (B), (ii) number of emissive species
(N), and (iii) SD of signal fluctuations.

As
shown in Figure 3A,B,
an increase in the calcein concentration increased the N value but decreased the B value. This
was expected because higher concentrations of calcein should increase
the number of emissive species. Indeed, the studied calcein concentrations
(0.1–3.6 μM) were much larger than that of LNCs. The
concentration of LNCs at 10 000-fold dilution, estimated based
on FCS focal volume (0.34 fL) and the observed N value
(0.58, without calcein), was ∼2.8 nM. Moreover, because LNCs,
containing a large number of NR668, are much brighter than single
calcein molecules (∼74 times brighter according to the FCS
measurement of brightness per particle at 10 mW, 830 nm illumination),
an increase in the number of the less bright species decreased the
overall brightness per particle. Remarkably, the SD parameter remained
unchanged in the broad concentration range of calcein. This parameter
did not change probably because LNCs, being much brighter than calcein,
were the main source of light fluctuations, totally controlling the
SD value. On the other hand, the SD value showed an almost linear
dependence on the NR668 dye loading (Figure 3C). The brightness also increased with NR668
loading, although the dependence was clearly not linear with a moderate
increase at low NR668 loadings, followed by a stronger increase at
higher loadings (Figure 3D). Remarkably, the number of emissive species showed a complicated
behavior: it rapidly decreased at low dye loadings and then decreased
much slower at higher loadings. The behavior of B and N parameters is complex because at very low
dye loading, the contribution of the calcein emission to the autocorrelation
curve is important, which increases the overall N values and decreases B. At higher loading, LNCs
become much brighter than calcein, so that they start dominating the
fluctuation analysis. Nevertheless, even at the highest loading the N and B parameters in the presence of 0.2
μM calcein were quite different from those for LNCs in Milli-Q
water, whereas SD showed practically the same value for these two
conditions (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Classical FCS parameters and SD of intensity fluctuations recorded
for dye-loaded LNCs in the presence of calcein (0.2 μM) in solution.
(A) Number of emissive species N and SD and (B) brightness

(corresponding to ∼2.8 nM LNCs) at different concentrations
of calcein. N and SD (C) and brightness of emissive
species (D) as a function of NR668 concentration inside LNCs. LNCs
are diluted 10 000 times in water containing 0.2 μM calcein.
Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 3). The empty symbols in (C,D) represent the parameters N, SD, and B for LNCs (NR668) in water
(without calcein).

These two experiments,
which model the release of dyes from LNCs,
suggest that B and N are not suitable
parameters for quantification of the release because they are nonlinearly
affected by the molecules present in the medium. The only parameter,
which appears useful for the leakage quantification is SD. Indeed,
it is only affected by the change in the dye content inside bright
LNCs but is practically independent from free single molecules of
calcein in solution, which are much less bright than single LNCs.
Thus, SD can directly indicate the dye content in LNCs without being
influenced by the fluorescence of the released dye.

However,
SD is not an absolute parameter, being strongly dependent
on instrument settings, such as laser power and instrumental alignment
as well as on LNC concentration. Therefore, we introduced a normalized
parameter SD/SD0, where SD0 represents the SD
of the fluorescence fluctuations for 1% NR668 LNCs in the absence
of leakage. The dependence of the SD/SD0 parameter on the
NR668 loading was verified for different laser powers and concentrations
of LNCs.

LNCs loaded with different NR668 concentrations were
measured by
FCS at two laser powers (7 and 10 mW) and at different LNC concentrations.
We found that the SD/SD0 parameter was not affected by
a change in the laser power (Figure 4A) or LNC concentration (Figure 4B), showing that it is a robust parameter.
The linear dependence of SD/SD0 on dye loading was then
used as a calibration curve (Figure 4A). It should be mentioned that the data point corresponding
to 1% loading slightly deviates from the fit (Figure 4A), probably because of some self-quenching
of the dyes at this high loading.

dye content inside LNCs. (A) Parameter SD/SD0 as a function
of NR668 content inside LNCs, using different two-photon excitation
powers. Linear fit of the obtained data. (B) Parameter SD/SD0 as a function of NR668 content inside LNCs, at different LNC concentrations.
Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 3).

Finally, we applied our new FCS-based
methodology to study the
release of the model cargo NR668 from LNCs. To this end, a release
experiment was performed by incubating LNCs loaded with 1 wt % NR668
at 20, 37, and 60 °C in three different media: (i) pure water,
(ii) water with blank LNCs, and (iii) water with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). During incubation in pure water, the NR668 LNCs were
very stable in water, showing no dye release even at 60 °C (Figure 5A), probably because
NR668 is very hydrophobic and cannot leak into neat water. In the
presence of blank LNCs or FBS, capable to solubilize NR668, we observed
dye release at 60 °C. Approximately 50 and 75% release was observed
after 6 h incubation for blank LNCs and FBS, respectively (Figure 5B,C). At 37 °C,
the dye release was observed only for FBS medium with nearly 50% release
after 6 h. The results observed with blank LNCs are perfectly in line
with our FRET data showing dye release exclusively at 60 °C (Figure 2B). However, in contrast
to the FRET approach, our methodology based on FCS enabled a quantitative
description of the dye release.

from LNCs (1 wt % dye load)
at different temperatures (20, 37, and 60 °C) in three different
media: (A) water, (B) water with blank LNCs, and (C) water with 10%
FBS. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 3).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed a new methodology for quantifying
the release of fluorescent dyes from LNCs. This methodology is based
on the SD of fluorescence fluctuations in FCS measurements. The proof
of concept was validated using the hydrophobic Nile red dye, NR668,
encapsulated in lipid nanoemulsions. The results suggest that LNCs
remain intact in water, whereas in FBS medium, they release their
content in a temperature-dependent manner. At 37 °C, the release
is relatively slow reaching 50% after 6 h of incubation. This method
of quantification is simple because it requires only measurement of
the SD of the fluorescence signal. This means that the recording can
be done in principle without any analysis of the autocorrelation curve.
Therefore, we expect that this method could be further extended to
basic confocal microscopy, where the release kinetics could be directly
followed by recording signal fluctuations in the focal volume.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
All chemicals and solvents for synthesis
were from Sigma-Aldrich. Labrafac WL (medium chain triglycerides)
by Gattefossé (Saint-Priest, France). Kolliphor HS15 (non-ionic
surfactant) was obtained from BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Ultrapure
water was obtained using a Milli-Q filtration system (Millipore, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines,
France). FBS was acquired from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium) and Gibco-Invitrogen
(Grand Island, USA). Dihexylamino-2-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-benzo[a]phenoxazin-5-one (NR668) and 4′-dioctylamino-3-octyloxyflavone
(F888) were synthesized as described before.11

Preparation and Characterization of Lipid Nanocarrier LNCs
Dye-loaded nanoemulsions were prepared by spontaneous nanoemulsification.47 We dissolved the dyes (NR668 or F888) in Labrafac
WL (35 mg) at concentrations of 1% by weight (unless indicated). Then,
Kolliphor HS15 was added (65 mg), and the mixture was homogenized
under magnetic stirring at 90 °C for 5 min. Finally, nanoemulsions
were generated by the addition of ultrapure (Milli-Q) water (230 mg)
under stirring. Size distribution was determined by DLS using a Zetasizer
Nano series DTS 1060 (Malvern Instruments SA). In DLS, measurement
statistics by volume was used.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence spectra were
recorded on a FluoroMax 4 (Jobin Yvon, HORIBA) spectrofluorometer.
Fluorescence emission spectra were performed at room temperature with
520 nm excitation wavelength for NR668 dye and 390 nm for F888 dye.
Emission spectra were corrected for lamp fluctuations and for wavelength-dependent
response of the detector. All fluorescence measurements were carried
out using solutions with absorbance ≤0.1 at the wavelength
of excitation.

FRET-Based Stability Test
The stability
of the dye-loaded
LNCs was estimated at three different temperatures 20, 37, 60 °C,
by FRET between two encapsulated dyes, 0.5 wt % of F888 (with respect
to Labrafac WL) used as energy donor and 0.5 wt % of NR668 used as
energy acceptor. The LNCs were diluted 1000 times from the original
formulation and incubated in water and 10-fold excess (100-fold dilution
from the original formulation) of blank nanocarriers (without encapsulated
dyes). The donor in the nanocarriers was excited at 390 nm, and the
emission spectra were recorded for both donor and acceptor.

FCS and
Data Analysis
FCS measurements were performed
on a two-photon platform based on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope,
as described previously.11 Two-photon excitation
at 830 nm (10 or 7 mW laser output power) was provided by a mode-locked
femtosecond Ti:Sa laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) pumped by a solid-state
laser (Millennia V, Spectra Physics). The measurements were performed
in a 96-well plate (Krystal, Porvair Science) using a 200 mL volume
per well at 25 °C. The focal spot was set about 20 μm above
the bottom of the well. This condition was found to provide an optimal
signal/noise ratio and to minimize the probe photobleaching. Emitted
fluorescence was filtered using a short-pass filter with a cutoff
wavelength of 680 nm (F75-680; AHF). The fluorescence was directed
to a fiber-coupled APD (SPCM-AQR-14-FC; PerkinElmer), and the fluorescence
fluctuation signals (F(t)) were
collected directly by a Multiple Tau correlation ALV-5000E correlator
(ALV GmbH). The autocorrelation curves were obtained in real time
by the correlator with the autocorrelation function (G(τ)) (eq 1) 1  where ⟨F(t)⟩ is the mean of the fluorescence signal (F(t)) and t is the lag time. Assuming
that LNCs diffuse freely in the excitation volume, each correlation
function, G(τ), was analyzed independently
on a homemade MATLAB (v.2010, MathWorks) program48 using the standard 3D diffusion model with one diffusing
species (eq 2), according
to Thompson49 2  where τd is the diffusion
time, N is the mean number of fluorescent species
within the two-photon excitation volume, and s is
the ratio between the axial and lateral radius of the excitation volume.
The excitation volume was calibrated with a solution of 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine
(TMR, Sigma-Aldrich) at 50 nM in phosphate buffer. The focal volume
obtained in these conditions was about 0.34 fL and s was between 3 and 4 (calibration before each acquisition series).

In parallel, the SD of the fluorescence signal was calculated by eq 3 and the brightness per
molecule (B) with eq 4 3   4  with n scalar observations.

The dye-loaded LNCs used for FCS measurements were diluted 10 000-fold
from the originally prepared LNCs. For each measurement, 20 acquisitions
of 10 s duration for LNCs (30 s for TMR) were performed, and the results
correspond to the median value obtained from these 20 repeats. For
each condition, the measurement was made in triplicate.

Samples for
FCS
The FCS parameters for in situ release
quantification were evaluated by measuring SD, N,
and B in two different series of samples. The first
one consisted 1 wt % NR668 LNCs and different concentrations of free
calcein dyes (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3.6 μM). The second one
consisted a fixed concentration of calcein (0.2 μM) and variable
concentrations of NR668 in LNCs (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 wt
%). The SD parameter was calibrated using LNCs in Milli-Q water (without
calcein) with different concentrations of encapsulated NR668. The
obtained SD values were normalized by dividing by SD0,
the SD of control LNCs without leakage (1 wt % NR668 LNCs in Milli-Q
water). The SD/SD0 ratio was plotted versus the wt % of
NR668 in LNCs, and the data were fitted with a linear function y = A + B × x, where a = 0.116; b =
0.994; y is SD/SD0, and x is the dye loading in LNCs (wt %).

Dye-Release Studies by
FCS
Dye-loaded LNCs were diluted
10 000-fold (∼2.8 nM) in three different media: pure
water, water with blank nanocarriers at 1000-fold dilution (10-fold
excess with respect to dye-loaded droplets), and water with 10% of
FBS. Then, samples were incubated at three different temperatures
20, 37, and 60 °C, for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. SD was measured
as a function of time and then converted into SD/SD0 to
obtain quantitative data on the dye release.
