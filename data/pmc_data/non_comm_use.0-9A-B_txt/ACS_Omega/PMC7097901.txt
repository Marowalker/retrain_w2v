SrRuO3, a 4d ferromagnet with multiple Weyl nodes at
the Fermi level, offers a rich playground to design epitaxial heterostructures
and superlattices with fascinating magnetic and magnetotransport properties.
Interfacing ultrathin SrRuO3 layers with large spin–orbit
coupling 5d transition-metal oxides, such as SrIrO3, results
in pronounced peaklike anomalies in the magnetic field dependence
of the Hall resistivity. Such anomalies have been attributed either
to the formation of Néel-type skyrmions or to modifications
of the Berry curvature of the topologically nontrivial conduction
bands near the Fermi level of SrRuO3. Here, epitaxial multilayers
based on SrRuO3 interfaced with 5d perovskite oxides, such
as SrIrO3 and SrHfO3, were studied. This work
focuses on the magnetotransport properties of the multilayers, aiming
to unravel the role played by the interfaces with 5d perovskites in
the peaklike anomalies of the Hall resistance loops of SrRuO3 layers. Interfacing with large band gap insulating SrHfO3 layers did not influence the anomalous Hall resistance loops, while
interfacing with the nominally paramagnetic semimetal SrIrO3 resulted in pronounced peaklike anomalies, which have been lately
attributed to a topological Hall effect contribution as a result of
skyrmions. This interpretation is, however, under strong debate and
lately alternative causes, such as inhomogeneity of the thickness
and the electronic properties of the SrRuO3 layers, have
been considered. Aligned with these latter proposals, our findings
reveal the central role played in the anomalies of the Hall resistivity
loops by electronic inhomogeneity of SrRuO3 layers due
to the interfacing with semimetallic 5d5 SrIrO3.

1 Introduction
Epitaxial
heterostructures and superlattices of perovskite oxides
have become a fascinating playground for solid-state physics researchers
over the past two decades. Tailoring physical properties by heterostructuring
dissimilar perovskites, to yield functionalities that do not exist
in the single compounds, has been the main driving force behind the
efforts to master the epitaxial growth of perovskite oxides. Lately,
there is a strongly motivated turn of attention toward 5d materials
with large spin–orbit coupling (SOC)-dominated properties and
this has been impacting the research of perovskite superlattices as
well.1−3 A highly appealing prospect has been that the proximity
of the 5d ions with large SOC to a ferromagnet in a heterostructure
that breaks the inversion symmetry may result in a strong Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya
interaction (DMI). If the resulting interfacial DMI is on a competitive
footing with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the Heisenberg
exchange interaction of the ferromagnet, noncollinear magnetic structures
with nontrivial topology can be stabilized in heterostructures or
multilayers. The heterostructure scenario, which has been highly successful
to generate nontrivial magnetic textures for metal multilayers, may
be tested also for perovskite superlattices. Moreover, the prospect
of forming skyrmions in epitaxial oxide heterostructures is very exciting,
as electric field effects may be employed to generate and/or manipulate
skyrmions.

Over the last couple of years, studies on magnetotransport
properties
of epitaxial ultrathin heterostructures involving the 4d transition-metal
oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) and the 5d semimetal SrIrO3 have sparked great interest, ignited by the proposal that very small
skyrmions (i.e., about 10 nm diameter)4−6 or noncoplanar magnetic
textures3 can form in ultrathin ferromagnetic
SrRuO3 layers interfaced with the large spin–orbit
coupling SrIrO3, as a result of a strong interfacial DMI.
The formation of skyrmions was primarily inferred from the observation
of anomalies in the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) resistivity loops
resembling contributions from a topological Hall effect (THE),7 which appeared in a range around the temperature
at which the anomalous Hall constant changes sign.4,8 However,
the origin of these unconventional features is still under debate.
Recently, the anomalies were attributed to spatial,8 structural,9 or electronic10 sample inhomogeneities that impact the anomalous
Hall effect by modifications of the band structure.

Here, we
studied a set of multilayers and heterostructures, in
which we interfaced the ferromagnetic SrRuO3 with the 4d
band insulator SrZrO3 and, on the other side, with the
5d SrIrO3 or with the 5d band insulator SrHfO3. Such asymmetric multilayers break the inversion symmetry at both
top and bottom interfaces of the ferromagnetic layer. We were motivated
to grow these complex multilayers by the expectation that in epitaxial
SrIrO3/SrRuO3/SrZrO3 multilayers
the possibly resulting interfacial DMI can be enhanced if additive
DMI can be obtained due to DMI of opposite signs at the top and bottom
interfaces, similar to the way in which DMI arises for metallic dipolar-coupled
asymmetric multilayers of Pt/Co/Ir or Pt/Co/Ta.11,12 DMI was experimentally and theoretically well studied and proved
for metallic multilayers,12 but no similar
studies of DMI at epitaxial oxide interfaces have been published so
far. The magnitude of interfacial DMI at the SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interface was addressed by preliminary calculations in ref (4), predicting a DMI of a
magnitude able to yield 10 nm small skyrmions. A large interfacial
DMI can significantly reduce the size of the magnetic domains with
nontrivial topology. Furthermore, the increased magnetic volume in
multilayers may reinforce the stability of metastable magnetic domains
against thermal fluctuations and thus expand their temperature stability
range closer to the Curie temperature of SrRuO3 layers.
However, as we will show later, it is unlikely that the anomalies
observed in the Hall effect resistivity loops are caused by skyrmions.

In the second part of this study, the role played by the electronic
structure of the 5d perovskite oxide SrIrO3 in the overall
anomalous Hall resistivity loops of the heterostructures was addressed
by substituting the strong SOC paramagnetic semimetal SrIrO3 (5d5 Ir ion) with the band insulator SrHfO3 (5d0 Hf ion). Unconventional anomalies resembling a THE
contribution were found only in all of the multilayers in which SrRuO3 was interfaced with SrIrO3 but not when SrIrO3 was replaced with insulating SrHfO3.

2 Results and Discussion
A summary of the microstructural
investigations by high-angle annular
dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
and high-resolution energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) of
two multilayers is presented in Figure 1, showing low-magnification overview micrographs in Figure 1a,f. The multilayer
6RIZ, possessing SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces, is
compared to the multilayer 6RHZ where the SrRuO3 is interfaced
with SrHfO3 instead of SrIrO3 (see Table 1 for their description).
The imaged multilayers exhibit good uniformity and thicknesses, matching
the expected thickness values from the monitoring by reflective high-energy
electron diffraction (RHEED) during their growth (see the Supporting Information). The five different perovskites
that we employ here, SrTiO3 (STO), SrRuO3, SrIrO3, SrHfO3, and SrZrO3, have at room temperature
(RT) pseudocubic lattice parameters increasing between 3.905 Å
(for SrTiO3) and ≈4.13 Å (for SrZrO3 that has the largest pseudocubic lattice parameter from the five
perovskites under study), resulting in compressive epitaxial strain
values of up to about 6%.13 Therefore,
strain relaxation is expected to occur, e.g., by formation of structural
domains and/or structural defects, such as misfit dislocations. For
example, orthorhombic domains with the long orthorhombic c axis oriented in-plane in two perpendicular directions could be
detected for multilayer 6RIZ by selective area electron diffraction
(SAED), taken during transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging
of the specimen (see the SAED patterns in Figure 1b,c). We note that at room temperature (RT)
all of the bulk compounds under study, except the cubic SrTiO3, have an orthorhombic structure (Pbnm space
group). The characteristic reflections yielded by orthorhombic distortions
(due to A-site atom displacements in Figure 1b and to oxygen octahedral rotations in Figure 1c) of the perovskite
layers are marked by the red circles. Additionally, misfit dislocations
were found in the upper part of the 6RIZ multilayer, for example,
in the top right area marked in Figure 1d by the yellow rectangle, at the interface between
the SrIrO3 layer and the topmost SrZrO3 capping
layer. In the case of sample 6RHZ, misfit dislocations form already
in the lower part of the multilayer: sample 6RHZ has larger levels
of epitaxial misfit strain, as SrHfO3 (pseudocubic lattice
parameter ≈4.07 Å14) has a
significantly larger lattice parameter than that of SrIrO3 (pseudocubic lattice parameter ≈3.96 Å15) and relatively large defects propagate through the whole
stack, as marked in Figure 1f,g. For zoomed-in HAADF-STEM images of the defects marked
by yellow rectangles, see Figure S2, Supporting
Information. High-resolution EDXS enabled us to observe the distribution
of the B-site cations (i.e., Ru, Ir/Hf, and Zr) in the individual
layers of the two different multilayers (Figure 1e,h), and the spatial extent of these cations
matches the expected layer thickness based on the RHEED monitoring
of the individual layer growth. The three-component layer sequence
was preserved across the entire multilayer (see Figure 1h).

and SrZrO3/SrRuO3/SrHfO3 (f–h)
multilayers, with nominally 6 ML-thick SrRuO3 layers (samples
6RIZ and 6RHZ). The overview STEM micrographs in (a) and (f) show
that the layers are uniform. The high-magnification micrographs in
(d) and (g) highlight the quality of the interfaces for both types
of multilayers. SAED patterns (displayed in (b) and (c)) acquired
by the transmission electron microscope allowed us to observe reflections
related to orthorhombic distortion (marked by red circles). The yellow
arrow in (b) marks the growth direction of multilayers. EDXS elemental
mapping images across the entire stacks with six repeats of the individual
layers of the two multilayers are shown in (e) and (h).

In Figure 2, we
summarized an overview of the total Hall resistance hysteresis loops
of the samples possessing SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces
as well as of a six monolayer (ML)-thick bare SrRuO3 thin
film studied as a reference sample (sample SRO in Table 1, see Figure 2a). The magnetic field was applied perpendicular
to the sample surface for all Hall resistance measurements reported
here. The trilayer RIZ, where we interfaced SrRuO3 with
SrIrO3 on one side and capped it with SrZrO3, shown in (c), is compared to the multilayer 5RIZ (see Figure 2d), which is a stacking
of 6 times the trilayer (see Table 1 for their description).

Figure 2 Hysteresis loops of the
total Hall resistance at different temperatures
for (a) 6 ML bare SrRuO3 (SRO), (b) bilayer sample RI (4
ML SrRuO3/2 ML SrIrO3), (c) trilayer sample
RIZ (4 ML SrRuO3/2 ML SrIrO3/2 ML SrZrO3), and (d) multilayer sample 5RIZ ([5 ML SrRuO3/2 ML SrIrO3/2 ML SrZrO3]6), capturing
the change of sign of the anomalous Hall effect around a sample-specific
temperature, TAHE.

The Hall resistivity, ρxy, of conventional ferromagnets is determined by two contributions,
resulting from the ordinary Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect,16,17 usually scaling with the perpendicular applied magnetic field and
the out-of-plane magnetization M, respectively. The
scaling factors R0 and Rs are the ordinary and anomalous Hall constants, respectively.
Accordingly, the ordinary Hall constant, R0, of the ferromagnetic thin films is determined by the slope of ρxy in the high magnetic
field range, where the magnetization is saturated and the anomalous
Hall resistivity is assumed to be field-independent. Typically, SrRuO3 epitaxial layers exhibit a negative ordinary Hall constant, R0, in a broad temperature range within the ferromagnetic
phase, consistent with electron-dominated transport, as observed in
bare SrRuO3 thin films18 and
SrRuO3-based multilayers19 grown
on SrTiO3(100) substrates.

As the temperature increases,
the anomalous Hall constant, Rs, of all
of the investigated heterostructures
has a complex temperature dependence and reverses sign from negative
to positive at a sample-specific temperature, subsequently named TAHE, which is usually close to the Curie temperature
of SrRuO3.

As we expect that the SrRuO3 layers of the multilayers
have an orthorhombic structure (confirmed by SAED patterns acquired
at RT, Figure 1b,c),
such behavior is in good agreement with the literature, where the
nonmonotonous temperature dependence of Rs was observed20−23 and also theoretically predicted23 for
orthorhombic SrRuO3 single crystals and thin films. The
change of Rs sign as a function of temperature
was attributed to the dominant contribution of the intrinsic AHE mechanism.
The total Berry curvature changes due to the Fermi level shift around
the crossing points of the conduction band through the temperature
scan and results in the change of sign of the intrinsic AHE conductivity.23−26

The anomalous Hall constant, Rs, of
the 6 ML bare SrRuO3 film (sample SRO) reverses its sign
a little below 130 K (see Figure 2a), close to the Curie temperature. In contrast, TAHE was decreased for the heterostructures exhibiting
SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces, accompanied by the
reduction of the ferromagnetic transition temperature (see Table 1 for further details).
For the bilayer RI, TAHE was about 25
K (Figure 2b, second
panel from the top). TAHE was about 60
K for the RIZ trilayer (see Figure 2c, second panel from the top) and about 90 K (Figure 2d, second panel from
the top) for the multilayer 5RIZ. These important variations of TAHE stress that not only the individual SrRuO3 layer thickness determines the AHE behavior but also the
particular interfaces and sample configurations play central roles.
The oxygen octahedra tilts may be slightly different for the SrRuO3 layer in the case of the RI and RIZ samples due to the extra
capping of the sample RIZ with 2 ML orthorhombic SrZrO3 with large oxygen octahedral tilts. Recently, there have been reports
that the inhomogeneity of the structure across SrRuO3 layers,
due to variations of the RuO6 octahedral tilts, may result
in inhomogeneous anomalous Hall conductivity and THE-like additional
contributions to the AHE resistivity loops.9,27

The AHE resistance loops of the investigated bare SrRuO3 sample (SRO) exhibited a square shape resembling closely the expected
magnetization hysteresis of ferromagnetically hard SrRuO3 epitaxial films when the magnetic field is applied close to the
magnetic easy axis.19 When SrRuO3 layers were interfaced with layers of the large SOC SrIrO3, peaklike features were observed for the AHE resistance loops of
the heterostructures close to TAHE. Such
anomalies were absent for the bare SrRuO3 film at any temperature
down to 10 K, which agrees with previous magnetotransport studies
of high-quality, orthorhombic SrRuO3 thin films.28 The peaklike anomalies were clearly present
in the heterostructures between 10 and 25 K for the bilayer RI, whereas
the temperature range was increased and shifted to higher temperatures,
50–60 K, for the trilayer RIZ and to 80–100 K for the
5RIZ superlattice. The AHE resistance loops of the RIZ and 5RIZ multilayers
had a square shape at low temperatures only (see the loops measured
at 30 or 50 K in Figure 2c,d).

In the last couple of years, similar anomalies of the
AHE resistance
loops were observed in a variety of bare SrRuO3 ultrathin
films or SrRuO3-based heterostructures, and their origins
were considered to be related to various mechanisms. A number of studies
assigned these peaklike features to the manifestation of the topological
Hall effect generated by the formation of skyrmions, when the magnetization
is being reversed between the opposite saturation states.4−6 However, such effects in the Hall resistivity and the formation
of skyrmions were reported also for ultrathin SrRuO3 films
interfaced with the ferroelectric BaTiO3. The DMI in the
absence of a 5d ion with strong spin–orbit coupling at the
SrRuO3/BaTiO3 interface29 was related to the ferroelectric off-centering of the ions at the
interface. Recently, similar THE-like contributions were observed
in bare SrRuO3 thin films grown under nonoptimal conditions30,31 or after postdeposition protonation,32 as well. Alternative interpretations for the origin of these anomalies
take into account that the electronic conduction bands of SrRuO3, which exhibits multiple Weyl nodes in proximity to the Fermi
level, are strongly dependent on external perturbations and on temperature.
The Berry curvature of these topologically nontrivial bands determines
the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity, which
is considered to be the dominant asymmetric scattering mechanism in
the case of SrRuO3.8 Therefore,
the origins of the observed anomalies in the Hall resistivity of SrRuO3-based heterostructures were assigned to changes in the band
structure of SrRuO3 induced by defects such as Ru vacancies
or H implantation,30,32 to inhomogeneity because of domains
with a distribution of coercive fields and of anomalous Hall constants,8 to interface-induced electronic effects,10 or to structural inhomogeneity.9,27

Moreover, very similar peaklike anomalies of the Hall loops
were
recently reported for other epitaxial films of ferromagnetic oxides,
such as the n-doped EuTiO3 (by La substitution of Eu) epitaxial
films.33 Nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence
of the anomalous Hall resistivity was measured, which was ascribed
to the change of electronic bands induced by Zeeman splitting during
the magnetization process. The anomalous Hall resistivity measurement
in La-doped EuTiO3 films showed additional terms in the
AHE during the magnetization process, which were not proportional
to the magnetization. Theoretical calculations indicated that the
change of the Zeeman field in the process of canting the magnetic
moments causes a shift of the Weyl nodes in the conduction bands,
resulting in a peculiar magnetic field dependence of the AHE, closely
resembling an additional THE contribution. In contrast to n-doped
EuTiO3 films, it is hard to expect that doping of SrRuO3 due to either charge transfer at SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces34 or to Ir substitution
of Ru in SrRuO3 films can tune the position of the Fermi
level around the conduction band crossings strongly because SrRuO3 typically has a large density of charge carriers. However,
ultrathin SrRuO3 films such as in our heterostructures
have lower electron densities. Moreover, in ABO3 perovskites,
B-site substitutions may result in distortions of the B–O–B
bond angles and lengths, thereby affecting the structural symmetry
and consequently the band structure. We therefore consider as a plausible
explanation that Ir replacement of Ru in the SrRuO3 due
to intermixing at SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces may
cause a similar effect on the anomalous Hall conductivity such as
that observed for the La-doped EuTiO3 films.

In addition,
oxygen ions might migrate across the interfaces, as
it has been observed in ferromagnet/oxide heterostructures.35,36 This would induce oxygen vacancies in one layer and oxygen excess
in the neighboring layer, which can influence the electronic properties
of the SrRuO3-based heterostructures.37 However, the oxygen surface exchange and the oxygen diffusion
coefficients were found to be comparably small in SrRuO3,38 and here, we did not address the details
of the stoichiometry of the layers by any techniques.

To test
whether the AHE resistance loops were proportional to the
magnetization loops and in which temperature range, in Figure 3, we compared the magnetic
moment hysteresis loops determined from superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) magnetometry measurements with the AHE resistance loops
(after subtraction of the ordinary Hall effect linear contribution).
We focused on comparing the data for the multilayers 5RIZ and 10RIZ,
with 5 ML-thick SrRuO3 and 10 ML-thick SrRuO3, respectively. In high magnetic fields (larger than 1 T), as the
magnetization of the multilayers was saturated, the anomalous Hall
resistance appeared to be proportional to the magnetization. Below
50 K, for the 5RIZ multilayer, the coercive field of the magnetic
moment loops and the magnetic field for which the anomalous Hall resistance
is zero are in good agreement, within the measurement accuracy. At
temperatures close to TAHE (at 85 K for
sample 5RIZ and at 110 K for sample 10RIZ, see Figure 3, upper panels), the AHE resistance loops
exhibit peaks, when, starting from a saturated state, the magnetization
direction starts reversing in the applied magnetic field of opposite
polarity. The magnetic moment hysteresis loops (black full symbol
curves in Figure 3)
do not show such peaklike features. The assumption of direct proportionality
of the anomalous Hall resistance to the magnetization23 fails to describe the AHE resistance loops in this particular
case, whereas it describes fairly well the AHE resistance loops of
the SRO sample (see Figure S7, Supporting
Information). Additionally, especially for the measurements of sample
10RIZ at 110 K (Figure 3b, upper panel), the value of the coercive field for the magnetic
moment loops and the value at which the AHE resistance is zero in
the AHE loops are dramatically different. Even at lower temperatures,
in the absence of any peaklike features (see the lower panel of Figure 3), discrepancies
in the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization and the anomalous
Hall resistance are present in the intermediate field range before
reaching the saturation of the magnetization. We note here that the
measurements summarized in Figure 3 were performed in different experimental setups (SQUID
magnetometer for the magnetic moment loops and physical property measurement
system (PPMS) for the AHE loops) so that slight differences in the
measurement temperature and also the effect of different ways how
the magnetic field was varied during running the hysteresis measurements
could not be ruled out (see the Supporting Information for further discussion).

Figure 3 Comparison between the anomalous Hall resistance
and the magnetic
moment loops for (a) sample 5RIZ [5 ML SrRuO3/2 ML SrIrO3/2 ML SrZrO3]6 and for (b) sample 10RIZ
[10 ML SrRuO3/2 ML SrIrO3/2 ML SrZrO3]6 at temperatures close to TAHE and much below TAHE (at 50 K). For the
sake of comparison with the Hall loops, the y axis
for the magnetic moment loops has inverted values.

We stress out that according to the experimental results
and the
theoretical calculations from ref (4), an effective DMI should vanish in bilayers with
SrRuO3 layers thicker than seven ML and thus no contribution
from an interface-driven THE should be observed any longer. However,
peaklike contributions of similar shape are also observed in the AHE
of our 10RIZ heterostructure that has 10 ML-thick SrRuO3 layers. This indicates that either the upper limit of 7 ML-thick
SrRuO3 layer for the SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces was an invalid prediction4 or the effective interfacial DMI is larger for SrRuO3 layers in our 10RIZ multilayers or the peaklike structures have
nothing to do with interfacial DMI. Therefore, we ought to look for
alternative explanations for the unconventional features of the AHE
resistivity loops of the samples with SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces. One possibility is the existence of inhomogeneity
within the SrRuO3 layers, exhibiting a distribution of
coercive fields, AHE constants, Rs, and
temperatures at which the AHE changes sign, TAHE. Considering the procedure proposed by Kan et al.,8 the general trend of the AHE curves can be reproduced
under the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of sample regions
possessing the temperature Ti (see Figure S9, Supporting Information).

Another
explanation may be that the anomalous Hall effect in SrRuO3 is dominated by the intrinsic mechanism due to the nontrivial
topology of some electronic conduction bands, with multiple Weyl nodes.
Effective intermixing of ordinary and anomalous Hall effect was observed
by Roy et al.39 In ref (39), it was concluded that
the AHE resistivity of SrRuO3 films cannot be described
as a sum of a term that depends linearly on the magnetic field and
a term that depends linearly on magnetization. This was attributed
to the dependence of the Weyl node contribution to the intrinsic AHE
conductivity on the magnetic field and the magnetization.

Imaging
of the magnetic domains is very helpful to elucidate whether
the formation of skyrmions is a viable explanation. Matsuno et al.4 and more recently Meng et al.6 performed magnetic force microscopy (MFM) investigations
of the domains in SrRuO3/SrIrO3 bilayers and
found small bubblelike domains, which formed in the temperature and
magnetic field range for which the AHE resistivity loops exhibited
the peaklike features. However, here, we have multilayers with many
repeats of the SrRuO3/SrIrO3, and in a previous
study on the magnetic interlayer coupling, we demonstrated that SrRuO3 layers separated by SrIrO3/SrZrO3 spacers
with a total thickness of 2–4 ML are only very weakly ferromagnetically
coupled.40 This rendered very difficult
our attempts to investigate the domains by MFM for the multilayers
studied here as the nucleation of domains occurred independently in
the individual SrRuO3 layers of the multilayers and the
magnetization switching process proceeded independently in the six
layers. The MFM measurements confirmed that the layers are decoupled
by observing that at many sites switching of the local magnetization
occurred six times for a multilayer with six SrRuO3 layers.
Consequently, no conclusive information on the formation of skyrmions
could be derived from our MFM investigations of the multilayers with
decoupled ferromagnetic layers (e.g., sample 5RIZ). MFM measurements
performed on the asymmetric heterostructure RIZ that has a single
SrRuO3 layer allowed, however, unambiguous imaging of the
magnetic domains. The summary of the MFM study of the RIZ sample can
be found in the preprint by Malsch et al.41 The MFM investigations of RIZ sample did not indicate the formation
of skyrmions in the temperature and magnetic field range where peaklike
anomalies were present in the AHE resistivity loops (see, for example, Figure 2c, 55–60 K).
The hump features of the AHE loops started to develop at values of
the magnetic field where, in the MFM experiments, the magnetization
was not yet changing as no observable nucleation of domains was occurring.
For example, at 55 K, in the prior saturated SrRuO3 layer
(in a field of 2 T), the first domains of reversed magnetization appear
to nucleate at fields larger than −95 mT, whereas the humps
of the corresponding AHE loops start developing at much lower fields.41 Inhomogeneities of the SrRuO3 layer
due to one unit cell thickness variation along the terrace ledges
were found to affect the local switching fields and suggested to impact
the global coercive fields.

To get more insight into the role
played by the interfacing of
SrRuO3 with SrIrO3 (with large SOC 5d5 Ir4+ ions), we fabricated multilayers in which the large
band gap insulator SrHfO3 (5d0 Hf4+ ions) layers substituted the SrIrO3 layers (see microstructure
investigations in Figure 1f–h and details of the samples in Table 1). The total Hall resistance
loops of the samples 5RHZ and 6RHZ are shown in Figure 4. In contrast to the multilayers possessing
SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces, the anomalous Hall
resistance of the multilayers with SrRuO3/SrHfO3 interfaces behaved rather conventionally: the AHE loops did not
show any peaklike anomalies resembling THE contributions. As typical
for SrRuO3, the sign of AHE was negative for the 5RHZ multilayer
up to 120 K (Figure 4a). For the 6RHZ multilayer, the sign of the AHE changed from negative
to positive at about 130 K, in close vicinity of the Curie temperature
of the sample (see Figure 4b). Anomalous Hall resistance loops from which the ordinary
Hall contribution was subtracted were compared with the Kerr rotation
angle loops and are shown in Figure 5. The Kerr rotation angle is assumed to be proportional
to the perpendicular component of the total heterostructure magnetization.
We emphasize here that the Hall and magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE)
measurements were performed in the same setup simultaneously, ensuring
identical measurement conditions in view of temperature and external
magnetic field orientation (further details can be found in the Supporting Information).

and at 30 K ((c) for 5RHZ, (d) for 6RHZ). For the sake of comparison
with the Hall loops, the y axis for the Kerr loops
has inverted values.

For the heterostructures
with SrRuO3/SrHfO3 interfaces, the anomalous
Hall resistance can be described by considering
the total thin film magnetization and an AHE constant, Rs, that is independent of the magnetic field. However,
we point out here that small deviations in the magnetic field dependence
of MOKE response and Hall resistance are still present due to the
imperfect corrections of the background, substrate, and impurity contributions,
affecting the loops measured by each technique (see also the discussion
in the Supporting Information, concerning
background corrections of the SQUID loops, Figure S4). Often, the anomalous Hall resistance is calculated by
taking input parameters from the measured MOKE loops4,5 or a predicted magnetization loop,42 but
the correction of the loops is not made available for the readership.
Subtracting thus-derived anomalous Hall resistance loops from the
total Hall resistance loops will generate a nonzero result, even for
loops without obvious peaklike anomalies. This should be taken into
account when magnetotransport measurements are used exclusively to
investigate the existence of skyrmions.

Compared to the SrRuO3/SrIrO3/SrZrO3 multilayers, the dislocation
density of the SrRuO3/SrHfO3/SrZrO3 multilayers is higher and clear variations
in SrRuO3 layer thickness were observed in the HAADF-STEM
investigations (summarized in Figure 1). If structural defects or SrRuO3 layer
thickness variations resulted in the deterioration of the physical
properties of the multilayers, the effect would be expected to be
more pronounced in the heterostructures possessing SrRuO3/SrHfO3 interfaces. However, we point out first that the
Curie temperature of the multilayers with SrHfO3 is considerably
larger than that of the multilayers with SrIrO3 (see Table 1 and Figure S5, Supporting Information). Furthermore, if thickness
variation of the individual SrRuO3 layers across the multilayers
was the dominant cause for the observed anomalies of the AHE resistance
loops,43 these anomalies should occur also
for the multilayers with SrHfO3. We also stress out that
as all of the heterostructures were grown under the same pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) conditions, we assume that the stoichiometry of the
SrRuO3 layers is very similar for the two types of multilayers,
and hence, the possibility that Ru vacancies resulted in the observed
peaklike anomalies30 can be ruled out for
our samples. However, it may be that intermixing at SrRuO3/SrHfO3 interfaces that resulted in Hf replacing Ru had
a benign effect on the electronic band structure of the SrRuO3, unlike the replacement of Ru with Ir at SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces. However, we have not had so far the
opportunity to analyze the intermixing issues quantitatively.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, interfacing ferromagnetic
SrRuO3 layers
with 5d perovskite oxides possessing large spin–orbit coupling
has been proposed as a route to generate interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya
interaction, which can result in the formation of noncollinear magnetic
texture and even ultrasmall skyrmions. Here, the magnetic and magnetotransport
properties of ultrathin SrRuO3 asymmetric heterostructures
with 5d perovskites were investigated and compared to those of a bare
SrRuO3 film of a similar thickness. For SrRuO3 layers interfaced with SrIrO3 (5d5 Ir4+ ions), unconventional features appear in the field dependence
of the anomalous Hall resistance. The substitution of the paramagnetic
semimetal SrIrO3 by the band insulator SrHfO3 (5d0 Hf4+ ions) resulted in drastic changes
in the anomalous Hall resistance loops of the SrRuO3 layers
and also the global magnetic properties. The ferromagnetic Curie temperature
and the temperature at which anomalous Hall constant, Rs, changes from negative to positive values were larger
for the multilayers with SrHfO3. The Hall resistivity loops
of the heterostructures with SrRuO3/SrHfO3 interfaces
can be described by a term that is linear in the magnetic field and
a term that is linear in magnetization and do not show any unconventional
behavior as, for instance, peaklike features. Our microstructural
investigations, showing an increased defect density for the multilayers
with SrRuO3/SrHfO3 interfaces, indicate that
the anomalies observed for the heterostructures possessing SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interfaces might originate in our case
from electronic inhomogeneity of the SrRuO3 layers rather
than from structural defects or thickness variation. We are reluctant
to consider that skyrmions could be at the origin of the THE-like
humps because MFM investigations of the RIZ sample (with a single
SrRuO3/SrIrO3 interface) did not reveal the
formation of any domains resembling skyrmions. The precise microscopic
mechanism driving the occurrence of the anomalies in the Hall resistance
loops is still to be determined and requires more input from theoretical
calculations of the band structure for SrRuO3/SrIrO3 and SrRuO3/SrHfO3 bilayers of similar
thickness as under study here. However, our results highlight the
importance of the details of interfacial interactions and structural
modifications of epitaxial SrRuO3 with a central role being
played most likely by the interactions with the large spin–orbit
coupling 5d5 Ir4+ ions.

4 Materials
and Experimental Methods
The samples (see the summary in Table 1) were fabricated
by pulsed laser deposition
(PLD) with a KrF excimer laser using stoichiometric targets of SrRuO3, SrIrO3, SrZrO3, and SrHfO3. The epitaxial layers were deposited on (100) SrTiO3 single-crystal
substrates that were etched in NH4F-buffered HF solution
for 2–2.5 min and annealed in air at 1000 °C for 2 h.
The substrate temperature was 650 °C and the partial oxygen pressure
was 0.133 mbar for the growth of all of the layers. The laser fluence
was about 1.5 J/cm2 for the ablation of all materials,
and the pulse repetition rate of the laser was 5 Hz for the SrRuO3 layers and 1–2 Hz for all of the other materials.

The deposition was monitored by reflective high-energy electron
diffraction (RHEED) (see Figure S1a–c, Supporting Information) under high oxygen pressure to observe the
growth mode and control the thicknesses of the SrZrO3,
SrIrO3, SrHfO3 layers, which grew in a layer-by-layer
growth mode. For all of the compounds grown here, a monolayer (ML)
is about 0.4 nm thick. To ensure the stoichiometric oxygen content
of the layers, the heterostructures were cooled down at a rate of
10 °C/min, in an oxygen atmosphere of 200 mbar. The morphologies
of the STO substrates and heterostructures were observed by atomic
force microscopy (see Figure S1d–f, Supporting Information). Scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) of cross-sectional specimens was conducted to investigate the
microstructure of the multilayers and their interfaces. High-angle
annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDXS) were performed with an FEI Titan 80200 ChemiSTEM
microscope. HAADF-STEM imaging enabled us to determine the thickness
of the individual layers and compare the values with those expected
based on RHEED data. The magnetization of the heterostructures, as
a function of temperature and magnetic field, was measured with a
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS
XL7 from Quantum Design). Magnetic background measurements of the
diamagnetic SrTiO3 substrates were performed and subtracted
from the total magnetic response (see the Supporting Information).

Hall effect measurements were carried out
in the four-point van
der Pauw geometry with permutating contacts for antisymmetrization.
Hall resistivity loops were recorded both with a physical property
measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design, Inc.) and with a homemade
setup enabling the simultaneous measurement of the transverse Hall
resistance and magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE). The polar MOKE studies
were performed with the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the
thin film surface by utilizing incoherent light. The probe wavelength
was chosen individually for each sample to reduce optical artifacts
like interference effects that can be present in ultrathin films of
SrRuO3. In the case of the MOKE investigations of the samples
5RHZ and 6RHZ, incoherent light of 650 nm wavelength was used.
