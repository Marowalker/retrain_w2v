Mesoporous SiO2 adsorbents
were combined with Fe oxide
nanoparticles (∼10 nm) that can catalyze thermal oxidation
of organic compounds at low temperatures. Fe oxide nanoparticle (∼10
nm)-incorporated SiO2 adsorbents were prepared via a temperature-regulated
chemical vapor deposition method followed by a thermal annealing process.
The removal efficiency and reusability of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles were examined and compared to those of bare SiO2. Upon deposition of Fe oxide nanoparticles, not only the equilibrium
adsorption capacity of mesoporous SiO2 for methylene blue
(MB) was improved but also the reusability of SiO2 adsorbent
was increased significantly. The adsorption ability of fresh Fe oxide/SiO2 particles can be almost fully recovered by simple thermal
annealing at atmospheric conditions (400 °C), whereas that of
bare SiO2 reduced significantly under same conditions.
In addition, full recovery of initial MB adsorption ability of Fe
oxide/SiO2 can be achieved by a 100 °C annealing process.
Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicated that Fe oxide nanoparticles
catalyzed thermal degradation of adsorbed MB molecules, resulting
in the improved reusability of the Fe oxide/SiO2 adsorbent.
In addition to reusability, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of
mesoporous SiO2 particles for various cationic dye molecules,
such as MB, malachite green, and rhodamine B, can be improved by combining
Fe oxide nanoparticles.

1 Introduction
Rapid
industrialization in the past decades has caused water pollution
and it has become one of the greatest environmental concerns in the
recent years. Many industries have utilized various synthetic dyes
to color their products, e.g., textile, paper, food, cosmetics, and
plastics.1−6 Most of the synthetic dyes are complex organic molecules and they
are not easily biodegraded when discharged into the water.6−10 These dyes can cause serious environmental problems even in their
low quantities. For instance, a small amount of dyes can readily change
the color of water, resulting in the reduction of sunlight penetration
into the water, which, in turn, inhibits the growth of aquatic bacteria.6,7 Besides, some of the synthetic dyes are carcinogenic or mutagenic
in various aquatic organisms.6,11,12

Many different methods such as adsorption, coagulation, advanced
oxidation, and membrane separation can be utilized for the removal
of synthetic dyes from the wastewater.6,9,13−19 Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages;15 however, among various methods, removal of dyes
using adsorbents has been considered as the most viable solution due
to its simplicity, cheapness, and effectiveness.6,13,20−22 The main drawback of
the adsorption method is that it only converts the phase of dye molecules
from aqueous to adsorbed phase but does not decompose them into harmless
species. That is to say, an additional treatment is required to decompose
the adsorbed dyes (often thermal annealing is utilized), otherwise
the used adsorbents are needed to be carefully disposed as waste.
After the additional treatments, the regenerated adsorbents can be
reused for the removal of dyes from wastewater; however, the loss
of their initial adsorption efficiencies often occurs. It has been
demonstrated that the regeneration of spent adsorbent can be achieved
using various techniques, such as solvent extraction,23 microwave radiation-assisted desorption,24 chemical decomposition,25 biological
degradation,26 and thermal degradation
of adsorbates.27−29 Among them, the thermal treatment has been considered
as one of the most viable methods due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness
and it has been already utilized to reactivate the granular activated
carbon.27−29

Owing to its excellent stability and ease of
separation from aqueous
phase together with large abundancy, SiO2-based materials
has been extensively used as adsorbents for organic pollutants and
supporting materials of heterogeneous catalysts.30−33 Recently, the fabrication pathway
of mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticles has been also investigated31,32 and SiO2 nanoparticle-based organic–inorganic
hybrid materials as heterogeneous catalysts have been investigated.33

Recently, we successfully synthesized
small Fe oxide nanoparticles
embedded into mesoporous substrates using a temperature-regulated
chemical vapor deposition (TR-CVD) followed by a thermal annealing
process.34 Our previous results demonstrated
that these Fe oxide nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic activity
toward thermal degradation of carbon-based compounds in their gas
phases (CO, acetaldehyde, and toluene).34−36 In this work, Fe oxide
nanoparticles were combined with mesoporous SiO2 based
on the aforementioned methods34−36 and, for the first time, we demonstrated
the utilization of the Fe oxide/SiO2 sample in the removal
of organic dyes from the aqueous phase. The performance of Fe oxide/SiO2 as an adsorbent for the removal of organic dyes from aqueous
phase, and its efficiency was compared to that of bare SiO2 not only in terms of its adsorption ability but also reusability
after the simple thermal annealing process at atmospheric conditions
(≤400 °C).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Fe Oxide/SiO2
Figure 1 shows cross-sectional
energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping
images of a TR-CVD-prepared Fe oxide/SiO2 particle before
the postannealing process. The elemental EDS mapping image of Fe indicates
that both inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous SiO2 particles
were covered by evenly distributed Fe oxide nanoparticles. After 8
h of postannealing (at 750 °C, 30 sccm of dry air flow), the
Fe oxide/SiO2 sample was further analyzed by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Figure 2a). The lattice structure of small Fe oxide
nanoparticles can be identified from the amorphous SiO2 in the HR-TEM image, which allowed us to determine the size of Fe
oxide nanoparticles (diameter of ∼10 nm) formed by the TR-CVD
and a subsequent annealing process. The lattice parameter of Fe oxide
nanoparticles obtained from HR-TEM corresponded to the (311) plane
of Fe oxide (α-Fe2O3 or Fe3O4).37,38

can be found. (b) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of bare SiO2 and the postannealed Fe oxide/SiO2. XRD peaks

Fe oxide, respectively, are marked as arrows. (c) Fe 2p3/2 core-level X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) of the postannealed
Fe oxide/SiO2.

Figure 2b
shows
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 annealed at 750 °C after the TR-CVD process. The bare
SiO2 sample did not show any feature in the XRD pattern
because of its amorphous nature. For the Fe oxide/SiO2 sample,
one can notice the appearance of peaks at 36 and 63°, which can
be attributed to (311) and (440) planes, respectively, of Fe oxide
(α-Fe2O3 or Fe3O4)37,38 and these results are in line with those
of the HR-TEM image. However, one cannot discriminate two different
phases of Fe oxide (α-Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) based on the results of TEM and XRD analyses
since both phases of Fe-oxides (α-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) exhibit almost the same lattice
constants.37,38 That is to say, Fe oxide/SiO2 consists of either α-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, or their mixture. Figure 2c shows Fe 2p3/2 core-level XPS
spectrum of the postannealed Fe oxide/SiO2 particles. A
broad peak extended from 716 to 706 eV was found in the binding energy
region of the Fe 2p3/2 core-level. The central position
of the binding energy of the Fe 2p3/2 core-level peak (∼710
eV) was closer to Fe3O4 states (∼710.4
eV) rather than α-Fe2O3 states (∼710.9
eV).39 However, one should note that many
elements resulting from final state effects were contributed to the
Fe 2p3/2 XPS peak;40−42 the Fe 2p3/2 peak
of Fe oxide can be fitted using six components arising from final
state relaxation effects (Figure S1).40−42 Considering this complexity and broadness of the Fe 2p core-level
peak resulted from the final state effect, we cannot exclude the possibility
of coexistence of Fe3O4 and α-Fe2O3 states.

The geometrical structure of Fe oxide-loaded
mesoporous SiO2 particles after postannealing was further
analyzed by obtaining
a nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm. The nitrogen isotherms
of bare SiO2 samples without and with the annealing process
(750 °C, 8 h, at a constant dry air flow of 30 sccm) were also
measured. The pore size distributions of bare SiO2 and
Fe oxide/SiO2 particles were obtained using Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) methods with each nitrogen isotherm (Figure 3). Pore volumes with a specific size (∼11
nm) decreased, whereas those of other sizes did not undergo noticeable
change upon the deposition of Fe oxide nanoparticles (∼10 nm).
It implied that Fe oxide nanoparticles (∼10 nm) were mostly
formed into the pores of SiO2 with a pore volume of ∼11
nm, although the formation of Fe oxide nanoparticles on exterior surface
of mesoporous SiO2 cannot be completely ruled out.

Figure 3 Pore size distributions
(BJH plots) of bare SiO2 and
Fe oxide/SiO2 particles.

The surface area and average pore diameter of three samples
were
estimated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) methods, respectively, based on each nitrogen isotherm, and
the results are summarized in Table 1. Original mesoporous SiO2 particles exhibit
a specific surface area of 302.6 m2/g and an average pore
size of 13.1 nm. These values remained almost the same after the annealing
process at 750 °C, indicating that the mesoporous structure of
SiO2 is highly stable even at the elevated temperature.
On the other hand, upon deposition of Fe oxide on SiO2 particles
and subsequent annealing at 750 °C, the specific surface area
decreased to 224.3 m2/g, whereas the mean pore size slightly
increased to 14.8 nm. This can be attributed to the formation of Fe
oxide nanoparticles (∼10 nm) whose size is less than the average
pore size (13 nm) of the SiO2 substrate. The pores of the
substrates smaller than the average pore size were occupied by Fe
oxide nanoparticles (Figure 3), increasing the average pore size and decreasing the specific
surface area. However, it is also possible that the Fe oxide nanoparticles
induced rupturing of porous structures of the SiO2 substrate
especially upon the annealing process at such a high temperature (750
°C). The amount of Fe loading of Fe oxide/SiO2 was
determined to be ∼8.3 wt % by the inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis (Table 1).

results, whereas the amount of Fe loading was determined by the ICP-OES
analysis.

2.2 Methylene
Blue (MB) Adsorption (Regeneration
of Adsorbents and Repeated MB Adsorption)
SiO2 particles loaded with Fe oxide nanoparticles via TR-CVD and subsequent
annealing (750 °C, 8 h) were tested as an adsorbent for MB removal
from solution, and hereafter, they are referred as Fe oxide/SiO2. MB adsorption experiments were repeatedly performed using
two adsorbents (bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2)
for 3 h at room temperature under dark conditions. Figure 4a schematically shows the sequence
of the experiments including the MB adsorption and annealing processes
conducted before each MB adsorption test. Prior to the 1st MB adsorption
experiment, each adsorbent was annealed at 400 °C for 3 h under
atmospheric air conditions. After the 1st MB adsorption test, each
adsorbent was collected from MB solution and annealed at 400 °C
for 3 h under atmospheric air conditions, referred as regeneration
process in Figure 4a. Then, MB adsorption experiments were performed again using each
regenerated adsorbent under the same experimental conditions as the
1st MB adsorption test.

Figure 4 (a) Procedures of repeated MB adsorption and
regeneration experiments
are shown. The absorbance changes of MB peaks (peak height at 664
nm) as a function of reaction time during 2 h of 1st and 2nd MB adsorption
experiments with (b) bare SiO2 and (c) Fe oxide/SiO2 are shown. The absorbance changes during the 1st MB adsorption
experiment (conducted with each of the fresh sample) are denoted as
empty markers, whereas those during the 2nd MB adsorption experiment
(conducted with each of the regenerated sample) are denoted as filled
markers. (d) Removal efficiencies of bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 calculated with the MB concentrations measured after 3 h
of each MB experiment are compared. (e) Removal efficiencies of Fe
oxide/SiO2 calculated with the MB concentrations measured
after 3 h of each MB experiment (performed before and after thermal
annealing at 200 or 100 °C, either) are compared.

UV/vis absorbance spectrum of MB solution was measured
every 20
min for the 2 h, and 1 h after that, the absorbance spectrum was obtained
again to follow the concentration change of MB solution due to the
adsorption of MB molecules on each adsorbent. A characteristic MB
absorbance peak with a maximum peak height at 664 nm was observed
in the range of 450–750 nm. For all cases of MB adsorption
experiments, decreases of the characteristic MB peak intensities were
found with increasing the reaction time, whereas the position and
shape of the MB absorbance peaks remained the same, indicating that
the adsorption of MB molecules on each adsorbent took place.

MB adsorption behaviors during the 1st and 2nd MB adsorption experiments
with each sample (bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2) are shown in Figure 4b,c. The MB absorbance peak heights at 664 nm (Abs. at λmax) were measured after background subtraction and plotted
as a function of reaction time during the 2 h of the 1st and 2nd MB
adsorption experiments (Figures 4b and 3c). Gradual decreases
of MB absorbance at 664 nm due to MB adsorption were observed as a
function of reaction time for all cases of experiments. Bare SiO2 exhibited a slightly better MB adsorption ability than Fe
oxide/SiO2 during the 1st MB adsorption test; the MB absorbance
peak intensity at 664 nm decreased by ∼44% after 2 h of the
1st MB adsorption test, whereas it decreased by ∼36% when Fe
oxide/SiO2 was used as an adsorbent under same experimental
conditions. However, the MB adsorption ability of bare SiO2 was significantly reduced when it was reused (the 2nd MB adsorption)
after 3 h of the 1st MB adsorption test and the regeneration process
(Figure 4b). On the
other hand, Fe oxide/SiO2 exhibited almost the same MB
adsorption behaviors when the 2nd MB adsorption experiment was repeatedly
performed after the regeneration process under the same conditions
(Figure 4c).

The MB adsorption abilities of bare SiO2 and Fe oxide
adsorbents at the 1st and 2nd MB adsorption experiments are compared
with their removal efficiency (%) (Figure 4d). The removal efficiency (%) is defined
as follows  where Co is the
concentration of MB solution at time zero (without any adsorbent)
and C is the concentration of MB solution after 3 h of each adsorption
experiment. The concentration of MB solution (C)
was calculated by converting the absorbance of the MB peak at 664
nm measured after 3 h of each MB adsorption experiment to the respective
MB concentration based on a linear relationship between the MB concentration
and absorbance peak height at 664 nm (data are not shown).

Figure 4d clearly
shows different behaviors of bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 adsorbents when each adsorbent was reused after the regeneration
process. The removal efficiency of bare SiO2 (∼54%)
was slightly higher than that of Fe oxide/SiO2 (∼47%)
for the case of the 1st MB adsorption test where each of the fresh
sample was used. When each adsorbent was reused (the 2nd MB adsorption
test) after the regeneration process (thermal annealing at 400 °C
for 3 h), the removal efficiency of bare SiO2 decreased
to 33 from 54%, whereas the efficiency of Fe oxide/SiO2 was only slightly reduced (from 47 to 42%). For the case of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles, the MB adsorption experiments were further performed
repeatedly using the same experimental procedures (regeneration by
3 h of annealing at 400 °C and repeated MB adsorption test) and
the removal efficiency at each repeated adsorption test is calculated
(denoted as the 3rd and 4th in Figure 4d). The removal efficiency values obtained from four
repeated MB adsorption experiments with Fe oxide/SiO2 particles
are very similar, indicating that the MB adsorption ability of Fe
oxide/SiO2 particles can be almost fully recovered by a
simple annealing process (at 400 °C, 3 h, under atmospheric air
conditions), whereas that of bare SiO2 cannot be fully
recovered by the same annealing process.

Additional experiments
were conducted with Fe oxide/SiO2 particles using lower
temperatures (200 and 100 °C) of thermal
annealing as the regeneration process. Prior to the regeneration process
at lower temperatures (200 and 100 °C), the collected samples
were dried at 60 °C for 4 h to remove remaining water molecules
absorbed by Fe oxide/SiO2 particles. Other experimental
conditions were the same as aforementioned cases except for the regeneration
process.

There were no noticeable differences in MB adsorption
behaviors
of Fe oxide/SiO2 before and after the regeneration process
at each lower temperature (at 200 and 100 °C) (Figure S2). The removal efficiency (%) of each case of study
after 3 h of the MB adsorption experiment was calculated and compared
in Figure 4e. The removal
efficiency of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles was almost fully
recovered upon 3 h of annealing at lower temperatures (200 and 100
°C) under atmospheric air conditions. The additional experiments
were performed with decreasing time duration (3 → 2 →
1 h) of 100 and 400 °C annealing to study the influence of annealing
temperature on the regeneration rate of the spent Fe oxide/SiO2 particles (please see Supporting Information, Figure S3). The equilibrium adsorption capacity
of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles was almost fully recovered irrelevant
to the time duration (1 or 2 h) of 100 and 400 °C annealing,
implying that the regeneration rate of Fe oxide/SiO2 was
not significantly influenced by the annealing temperature under our
experimental conditions (Figure S3).

Furthermore, we analyzed the surface of bare SiO2 and
Fe oxide/SiO2 before and after the regeneration process
by means of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to understand
the origin of the improved recoverability of MB adsorption ability
of Fe oxide/SiO2 compared to that of bare SiO2 (Figure 5). After
the 1st MB adsorption experiment, FT-IR spectrum of each sample (bare
SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2) surface was measured
in an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode and each sample surface
was analyzed again by the FT-IR after regeneration process (400 °C
annealing for 3 h under atmospheric air conditions). Characteristic
SiO2 peaks were observed in the wavenumber range of 1400–500
cm–1, and intensity of each IR spectrum was normalized
by the respective intensity of the Si–O–Si stretching
peak at 1056 cm–1.43

Figure 5 (a, c)
FT-IR spectra of bare SiO2 particles measured
after the 1st MB adsorption experiment (before the regeneration) and
after the regeneration process. (b, d) FT-IR spectra of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles measured after the 1st MB adsorption experiment
(before the regeneration) and after the regeneration process. The
spectra measured after the 1st MB adsorption experiments are denoted
as dotted lines, while those measured after the regeneration process
are marked as solid lines.

Figure 5 shows
FT-IR
spectra of bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 measured
after MB adsorption and regeneration processes in two wavenumber ranges
of 1900–1400 and 4000–2500 cm–1. After
MB adsorption (before the regeneration process), MB-related IR peaks
were observed both on two samples (bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2). The pronounced peak at ∼1630 cm–1 corresponds to vibrations of the dimethyl amino group (C=N+(CH3)2) of MB molecules, and the lower-intensity
peak at 1602 cm–1 corresponds to C=C and
C=N heterocyclic vibrations.44 The
intense and broad band of vibration of OH groups extended from 3600
to 3100 cm–1 is also observed after MB adsorption.
This broad band can be associated with a complex set of bonded OH
groups included in interacting with various forms of MB molecules
in solution (monomer, dimer, and H-aggregates) through the nitrogen
atoms of MB heterocycle or dimethyl amino group.44

In the case of bare SiO2 (Figure 5a,c), marginal intensity decreases
of MB-related
IR bands were observed after the regeneration process (400 °C
annealing for 3 h under atmospheric air conditions). On the other
hand, the MB-related IR bands underwent much dramatic changes on the
surface of Fe oxide/SiO2 upon the same regeneration process.
In the wavenumber regime of 1900–1400 cm–1 (Figure 5b), the
intensity of the characteristic MB peaks (C=N+(CH3)2) centered at ∼1630 cm–1 decreased by more than 50%, whereas two additional peaks at 1477
and 1456 cm–1 appeared upon regeneration, which
can be attributed to the C–H bending vibrations of −CH3 groups. Similar changes were also observed in the other wavelength
range (4000–2500 cm–1), as shown in Figure 5d. The broad vibration
band of bonded −OH groups relating to the various forms of
MB molecule complexes almost disappeared upon regeneration, whereas
new peaks relating to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of −CH3 groups appeared in the wavenumber range of 2910–2858
cm–1.

Our experimental observations imply
that, in the presence of Fe
oxide nanoparticles, thermal decomposition of MB molecules adsorbed
on SiO2 particles took place during the regeneration process
(400 °C annealing for 3 h under ambient air conditions). These
results indicate that Fe oxide nanoparticles loaded on the SiO2 adsorbents acted as a catalytic active center for the thermal
degradation of MB molecules under our experimental conditions. It
is worth mentioning that Fe oxide nanoparticles synthesized on mesoporous
substrates via similar processes used in this work (TR-CVD and postannealing
processes) have been previously proved to exhibit high catalytic activities
for thermal degradation of organic compounds (CO, acetaldehyde, and
toluene).34−36

One might already notice the appearance of
the characteristic IR
peak of molecular water at high wavenumber region (>3600 cm–1) upon the regeneration of Fe oxide/SiO2 adsorbent (Figure 5d), and this can
be associated to the formation of molecular water45 during the oxidation of MB molecules adsorbed on the Fe
oxide/SiO2 surface. Please note that the total oxidation
of organic compounds produces CO2 and H2O as
final products. Thus, it seems that total oxidation of adsorbed MB
molecules on Fe oxide/SiO2 also took place during the regeneration
process, although some of them underwent partial oxidation leaving
intermediates mostly consisting of CH3 bonds. Based solely
on the results of IR analyses, however, one cannot determine the exact
products or intermediates of the oxidation of adsorbed MB molecules
upon the regeneration of Fe oxide/SiO2 adsorbents. Further
investigations, e.g., surface analysis during the regeneration process
using operando FT-IR, are ongoing to understand the detailed mechanism
of MB degradation on Fe oxide/SiO2 particles.

Nevertheless,
these findings can already explain the reason behind
the higher recoverability of MB adsorption capacity of Fe oxide/SiO2 than that of bare SiO2 upon the same thermal annealing
process. Most of the adsorbed MB molecules did not undergo the thermal
degradation on the surface of bare SiO2 during the regeneration
process. They occupied the adsorption sites of SiO2 adsorbents
after regeneration, resulting in the decrease of the MB adsorption
ability as bare SiO2 was reused for MB adsorption. However,
in the case of Fe oxide/SiO2, Fe oxide nanoparticles catalyzed
thermal degradation of adsorbed MB molecules, regenerating the adsorption
sites on the surface of adsorbents either by total oxidation or by
partial oxidation of adsorbed MB molecules. Some of the MB molecules
were partially oxidized, leaving some intermediate carbon species
on the Fe oxide/SiO2 surface; however, these smaller species
did not disturb MB molecules to be adsorbed on Fe oxide/SiO2 when Fe oxide/SiO2 was reused for MB adsorption. Therefore,
the MB adsorption ability of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles can
be almost fully recovered by the regeneration process (400 °C
thermal annealing for 3 h under atmospheric air conditions).

2.3 Further Analysis of the Regeneration Process
(TGA and XPS Analyses)
Regeneration processes on both SiO2 particles (bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2) were further studied by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To increase the MB-related
signal on both analyses, the MB concentration was doubled (5 to 10
mg/L) and the solution was agitated using a shaker at a constant speed
(300 rpm). More details on sample preparation for TGA and XPS analyses
are provided in the Materials and Methods section.

Figure 6a,b shows
TGA results of MB-adsorbed two SiO2 particles (bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2), and those of the fresh sample
are also shown in Figure 6c,d for comparison. Weight loss below 200 °C was attributed
to the desorption of water molecules, and it was pronounced on MB-adsorbed
SiO2 particles than MB-adsorbed Fe oxide/SiO2 particles, indicating that a higher amount of water molecules remained
on the bare SiO2 particles. Both MB-adsorbed samples exhibited
gradual weight loss after 200 °C with the increasing temperature.
The amount of weight loss after 200 °C for both cases of SiO2 particles (MB-adsorbed bare SiO2 and MB-adsorbed
Fe oxide/SiO2) was larger than that for the respective
fresh sample, which can be attributed to the degradation of adsorbed
MB molecules. Figure 6e shows the TG spectrum of each MB-adsorbed SiO2 particles
subtracted by the respective TG spectrum of the fresh sample. This
plot more clearly indicates that weight loss relating to thermal degradation
of MB molecules is pronounced for the case of Fe oxide/SiO2 than that of the bare SiO2 sample. We would like to mention
that the amount of adsorbed MB molecules on both SiO2 particles
was very similar, which implies that the thermal degradation of MB
molecules can facilitate on mesoporous SiO2 in the presence
of Fe oxide nanoparticles.

Figure 6 (a, b) TG and DTG spectra of MB-adsorbed SiO2 and MB-adsorbed
Fe oxide/SiO2 particles. (c, d) TG and DTG spectra of as-prepared
SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 particles. (e) TG spectra
of each MB-adsorbed SiO2 particle (SiO2 or Fe
oxide/SiO2) subtracted by the respective TG spectrum of
the as-prepared sample.

Figure 7 shows
the
result of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of each MB-adsorbed
SiO2 particle together with that of each of the as-prepared
sample. Various processes can take place simultaneously during the
thermal treatment of DSC analysis, such as evaporation of weakly bound
species (endothermic), bond breaking (endothermic), oxidation (endo-
or exothermic), and combustion of surface carbon (exothermic), which
resulted in a very broad feature especially in the temperature range
of 200–600 °C (Figure 7). Moreover, these make it very difficult to assign
each broad peak to a specific thermal process. Nevertheless, we observed
the difference in DSC spectra measured with each of SiO2 before and after MB adsorption, which was much pronounced in the
case of Fe oxide/SiO2 than that of bare SiO2. These results are in line with other analysis results (FT-IR and
TGA), indicating the pronounced thermal processes relating to the
decomposition of adsorbed MB on the surface of Fe oxide/SiO2 (e.g., formation of −CH3 species by partial oxidation
of MB and combustion of −CH3 species) than the bare
SiO2 surface.

Figure 7 (a) DSC spectra of as-prepared SiO2 and MB-adsorbed
SiO2. (b) DSC spectra of as-prepared Fe oxide/SiO2 and MB-adsorbed Fe oxide/SiO2.

Figure 8 shows
the
Fe 2p core-level XPS spectrum of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles
regenerated at 400 °C for 3 h following the MB adsorption experiments
using a shaker (experimental details can be found in the Materials and Methods section). For comparison,
the Fe 2p core-level XPS spectrum of as-prepared Fe oxide/SiO2 particles is also displayed in Figure 8. The extension of the Fe 2p XPS peak to
a lower binding energy region was observed after the regeneration
process; the Fe 2p3/2 peak extended to a lower binding
energy region (<710 eV) upon the regeneration process. The extension
of lower binding energy can be attributed to the formation of metallic
Fe of which the Fe 2p3/2 peak is located at ∼707
eV. By adding an additional component centered at 707 eV (metallic
Fe states) to the Fe 2p3/2 peak of as-prepared Fe oxide/SiO2, the shape of the Fe 2p3/2 peak of regenerated
Fe oxide/SiO2 can be well fitted (Figure S1); the Fe 2p3/2 peak of regenerated Fe oxide/SiO2 was well fitted by adding an component at 707 eV (metallic
Fe states) to six components (oxidized Fe states), which were used
for peak fitting of the as-prepared sample case. Our XPS analysis
results imply that some of Fe oxide were reduced into metallic Fe
states during the regeneration process at 400 °C, whereas the
remaining Fe oxide did not undergo significant changes in their oxidation
states, i.e., between Fe(II) and Fe(III) states.

oxide/SiO2 particles (denoted as-prepared and after regeneration,
respectively).

It had been demonstrated
that the metal–support interaction
can play a role on catalytic performance of Fe oxide nanoparticles;36,40 however, further investigations utilizing an operando technique
are required to understand the origin of catalytic activity of Fe
oxide nanoparticles and determine the exact oxidation states of Fe
oxide nanoparticles responsible for the catalytic activity for MB
degradation.

2.4 Equilibrium Adsorption
Capacity for Various
Organic Dyes
The equilibrium adsorption capacity of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles for three different cationic organic dyes (methylene
blue (MB), malachite green (MG), and rhodamine B (RhB)) were examined
and compared to that of bare SiO2 particles. Organic dye
adsorption experiments were performed with 30 mL of each organic dye
solution (10 ppm) and 0.03 g of each SiO2 particle (bare
SiO2 or Fe oxide/SiO2). After 3 h of agitation
(at 300 rpm and 20 °C) of each dye solution containing the adsorbent,
no obvious decrease of concentration was found for all cases, implying
that the dye adsorption reached its equilibrium states within 3 h.

Figure 9 shows the
equilibrium removal efficiency (%) of bare SiO2 and Fe
oxide/SiO2 for three organic dyes (MB, MG, and RhB) obtained
from 3 h of adsorption experiments using a shaker. For all three cationic
organic dyes, the equilibrium removal efficiency (%) of mesoporous
SiO2 was improved upon incorporation of Fe oxide nanoparticles
into the pore structure of SiO2. Considering that the BET
surface area decreased upon the formation Fe oxide nanoparticles,
the surface of Fe oxide nanoparticles seems to exhibit higher affinity
for cationic dye adsorption than that of the bare SiO2 surface.
We would like to mention that both bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 particles did not exhibit noticeable adsorption ability toward
methyl orange, which is an anionic organic dye molecule, implying
that the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and organic
dyes might come into play. Further investigations are now ongoing
to derive kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that can give a deeper
understanding of the organic dye adsorption process on mesoporous
SiO2 with and without Fe oxide nanoparticles in the aqueous
phase.

Figure 9 Equilibrium removal efficiency (%) of bare SiO2 and
Fe oxide/SiO2 for three cationic organic dyes (MB, MG,
and RhB) are compared. The efficiency was obtained from 3 h of the
adsorption experiment with each organic dye solution (10 ppm) using
a shaker (300 rpm).

Furthermore, we studied
the effect of the amount of Fe oxide on
mesoporous SiO2 on the equilibrium adsorption capacity
of Fe oxide/SiO2. Three Fe oxide/SiO2 samples
with different amounts of Fe loadings (1.4, 7.23, and 8.3 wt %) were
prepared, and their equilibrium adsorption capacities for MB molecules
were examined. Details on sample preparation and MB adsorption experiments
can be found in the Materials and Methods section.

Figure 10 shows
that the equilibrium removal efficiencies of Fe oxide/SiO2 can be further improved by reducing the amount of Fe loading on
mesoporous SiO2 particles, although the surface of Fe oxide
has higher affinity for MB adsorption than that of SiO2 surface. This is mainly because of the increase of the surface area
of Fe oxide/SiO2 with the decreasing Fe loading. Please
note that the trend of equilibrium removal efficiency (%) change upon
the variation of Fe loading is well matched with that of BET surface
area (m2/g) (Figure 10). It is worth mentioning that the adsorption capacity
of the Fe oxide/SiO2 sample with a Fe loading of 1.4 wt
% can be also fully recovered by the regeneration process.

Figure 10 Equilibrium
removal efficiency (%) of Fe oxide/SiO2 for
MB adsorption are displayed as a function of Fe loading (wt %). The
BET specific surface areas (m2/g) of Fe oxide/SiO2 as a function of Fe loading (wt %) are also shown.

3 Conclusions
Fe oxide
nanoparticles (∼10 nm) were synthesized by a TR-CVD
method followed by a thermal annealing process (at 750 °C, 8
h, a constant dry air flow of 30 sccm) on mesoporous SiO2 particles. The formation of Fe oxide nanoparticles with a size of
∼10 nm into the porous structure of SiO2 was evidenced
by HR-TEM, XRD, and N2 isotherm analyses. The performances
of mesoporous SiO2 with and without Fe oxide nanoparticles
toward MB removal from an aqueous phase were examined. The adsorption
ability of fresh Fe oxide/SiO2 examined for 3 h of MB adsorption
experiments using a magnetic stirrer was comparable to that of fresh
SiO2 particles, although the BET surface area decreased
upon the formation of Fe oxide/SiO2. Each of the used SiO2 particle was collected from the solution and annealed at
400 °C, and then, the adsorption ability of each SiO2 particle was examined again under the same conditions. The original
MB adsorption ability of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles can be
almost fully recovered after the regeneration process (3 h of annealing
at 400 °C), whereas that of bare SiO2 decreased significantly
under the same conditions of regeneration. Besides, the MB adsorption
ability of Fe oxide/SiO2 was maintained even after further
repeated MB adsorption following each regeneration process (for four
times of repeated MB adsorption tests) and its MB adsorption ability
was almost fully recovered by annealing at low temperatures (200,
100 °C). The regeneration process of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles was further studied by means of FT-IR, TGA, and XPS analyses,
and the results indicated that Fe oxide nanoparticles can catalyze
the thermal degradation of adsorbed MB molecules, reproducing the
adsorption sites. In addition, it was found that the equilibrium capacity
of mesoporous SiO2 for the cation organic dye (MB, MG,
RhB) adsorption can be further improved by the formation of Fe oxide
nanoparticles in the porous structure of the SiO2 adsorbent.
Our experimental observations demonstrate the potential application
of the combined structure of Fe oxide nanoparticles and mesoporous
adsorbents in a water purification system.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Sample Preparation
The Fe oxide/SiO2 particles were prepared by a TR-CVD method and a subsequent
postannealing process, which were previously introduced.34 Commercially available mesoporous SiO2 particles bought from Sigma Aldrich (a particle size of 250–500
μm (35–60 mesh) and a mean pore size of 15 nm) were used
as a substrate. Bis(cyclopentadienyl) iron (Fe(Cp)2, Aldrich)
was used as a metal precursor, whereas oxygen and water originally
existing in the reactor served as oxidizing agents during TR-CVD of
the iron oxide on SiO2 particles. More details on the reactor
setup can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S4). TR-CVD of iron oxide on SiO2 particles
was proceeded via two steps. First, the temperature of the chamber
was increased to 60 °C and then maintained for 2 h. During this
first step, solid Fe(Cp)2 precursors were vaporized and
the vaporized precursor molecules were diffused into the internal
porous structure of SiO2 particles, probably adsorbed on
both outer and inner surfaces of mesoporous SiO2 particles.
As a second step, the temperature of the chamber was further increased
to 200 °C and maintained for 12 h. At this higher temperature,
oxygen or water already existing in the reactor now reacted with adsorbed
Fe(Cp)2 on SiO2 particles, converting it to
iron oxides. After TR-CVD of iron oxides on SiO2 particles,
the particles were further annealed at 750 °C for 8 h using a
furnace at a constant dry air flow (30 sccm) condition (Figure S4). The sample (1.3 g) was put on a quartz
boat, and the boat was place on the center of a quartz reactor. Dry
air flow was controlled by a mass flowmeter controller (MFC), and
the temperature of the reactor was monitored and controlled using
a furnace equipped with a K-type thermocouple. Two Fe oxide/SiO2 samples with lower amounts of Fe loading (1.4 and 7.23 wt
%) were prepared using a furnace (PMF-3, U1TECH). Ferrocene powder
samples (0.5 and 2.5 g) were mixed with 10.0 g of SiO2 particles
and placed in a quartz crucible (100 mL), and the crucible was placed
in the furnace. The temperature was regulated as aforementioned (60
°C for 2 h and 120 °C for 12 h), and 1.3 g of samples were
taken and annealed at 750 °C for 8 h at dry air flow (30 sccm).

4.2 Sample Characterization
After the
TR-CVD process for Fe oxide deposition on mesoporous SiO2 particles, the particles were mechanically fractured and the element
distribution of the cutting planes was analyzed using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-7100F) equipped with EDS. After the postannealing
process (at 750 °C for 8 h under a dry air flow), the geometrical
structure of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles was analyzed by HR-TEM
(JEOL, JEM ARM 200F). Prior to TEM measurements, samples were grounded.
Crystallinity of Fe oxide/SiO2 samples was analyzed by
obtaining XRD patterns by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Ultima
IV) using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 1.54 A) with
a scanning rate of 4°/min. For comparison, the XRD pattern of
bare SiO2 was also gathered under the same conditions.
More information about the internal structure of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles was obtained by determining the surface area and
average pore diameter of Fe oxide/SiO2 particles by BET
and BJH methods, respectively, based on N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms (3Flex, Micromerities), and the results of BET and BJH plots
were compared to the respective data of bare SiO2 without
and with annealing. The amount of Fe loading on the Fe oxide/SiO2 sample was determined using ICP-OES. XPS spectra of the as-prepared
and regenerated Fe oxide/SiO2 sample were obtained at room
temperature using an Mg Kα line and a concentric hemispherical
analyzer (CHA, PHOIBOS-Has 2500, SPECS). TGA and DSC analyses were
performed at a constant heating rate (10 °C/min) under atmospheric
air conditions using a thermogravimetric analyzer (SDT Q600, TA Instruments).
FT-IR spectra (4000–400 cm–1) were obtained
in an ATR mode by accumulating signals of 64 scans using an FT-IR
spectrometer (optics-vertex 70, Bruker). Each IR spectrum (4000–400
cm–1) was obtained by accumulating signals of 64
scans measured at a scanning velocity of 1.6 kHz under room temperature.

4.3 MB Adsorption Test
The MB adsorption
tests on bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 were proceeded
by placing 0.05 g of each sample on the bottom of a glass beaker (250
mL) containing 70 mL of MB solution with an MB concentration of 5
ppm (5 mg/L). Prior to the MB adsorption experiments, each sample
was annealed at 400 °C for 3 h under atmospheric air conditions.
During the adsorption experiments, MB solution was agitated using
a magnetic stirrer (spinning speed of 120 rpm) placed at the center
of the beaker bottom. The magnetic stirrer was physically separated
from SiO2 particles (bare SiO2 or Fe oxide/SiO2) by a glass dish to prevent particles from possible cracking
induced by a physical collision with the spinning stirrer. MB adsorption
experiments were conducted for 3 h at room temperature under dark
conditions. To follow the change of MB concentration due to the adsorption
on SiO2 particles (bare SiO2 or Fe oxide/SiO2), a 4 mL aliquot was collected and its UV–vis absorbance
in the wavelength range of 400–900 nm was measured using a
UV–vis spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Genesys 10S UV–vis
spectrometer). After the measurement, the aliquot was reinfused into
the beaker containing MB solution and SiO2 particles. The
UV–vis absorbance measurement was carried out every 20 min
for the first 2 h of MB adsorption experiments, and then, the absorbance
was again measured after 1 h (total 3 h of MB adsorption experiments).
The pH values of MB solution before and after the MB adsorption experiments
were measured using a pH meter (Seven Compact S210, Mettler Toledo),
and there were no changes of solution pH upon MB adsorption experiments
for all cases of study (pH = 7).

4.4 Regeneration
of the Adsorbent and the Repeated
MB Adsorption Test
After 3 h of MB adsorption experiments,
SiO2 particles (bare SiO2 or Fe oxide/SiO2) were collected and annealed at 400 °C for 3 h under
ambient conditions using a furnace. During this annealing process,
collected samples were put on a quart boat and the boat was placed
at the central part of a quartz tube. The setup used for this annealing
process was the same as the one shown in Figure S5, except for, in this case, both sides of the quartz reactor
were opened to the ambient air. After the regeneration process via
thermal annealing, MB adsorption experiments were performed with each
sample (0.05 g) under the same experimental conditions mentioned above.

4.5 Examination of the Equilibrium Adsorption
Capacity for Organic Dyes
Each SiO2 particle (0.03
g) (bare SiO2 or Fe oxide/SiO2) preannealed
at 400 °C for 3 h was placed at the bottom of a glass vial containing
30 mL of organic dye solutions (MB, MG, RhB, and MO) with a concentration
of 10 ppm (10 mg/L). The upper part of vials was covered with a Teflon
cap, and the vials were agitated at a constant shaking speed (300
rpm) using a shaker (IST-4075R, JEIO TECH) for 3 h. At a certain time-interval,
the shaker was turned off and a 4 mL aliquot of the solution was taken
from the vial for the measurement of UV–vis absorbance. After
the absorbance measurements, the aliquot was reinfused into the vial
containing MB solution and SiO2 particles and the vial
was covered again by the cap. Then, the agitation was restarted using
the shaker to continue the MB adsorption on SiO2 particles.
After 3 h of MB adsorption experiments, collected bare SiO2 and Fe oxide/SiO2 particles were dried at 60 °C
for 3 h at ambient air conditions and then samples were analyzed by
TGA. Fe oxide/SiO2 particles collected from the solution
after 3 h of MB adsorption experiment were annealed at 400 °C
for 3 h at ambient air conditions prior to XPS analysis. The ground
Fe oxide/SiO2 particles were pelletized for XPS analysis.

4.6 Examination of Equilibrium Adsorption Capacity
of Fe Oxide/SiO2 with Different Fe Loading Amounts
Equilibrium adsorption capacities of three Fe oxide/SiO2 samples with various amounts of Fe loading (1.4, 7.23, and 8.3 wt
%) were examined using 30 mL of MB solution with a concentration of
20 ppm (20 mg/L) for 3 h. MB solution (30 mL) and 0.03 g of each sample
were placed in a glass vial, and the vial was sealed by a Teflon cap.
The vial was agitated for 3 h at 300 rpm using a shaker, and then,
4 mL of the aliquot was taken for UV–vis measurements.
