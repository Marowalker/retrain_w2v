To detect hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water content in
dimethyl sulfoxide, the fluorescent probe (Probe 1) was
used, as it not only detects H2S but also detects the water
content. After H2S was added into Probe 1,
the intensity of fluorescence increased and was up to 1300 times.
In case the H2S concentration was in the range 0–20
μM, it was able to be detected by Probe 1, and
the limit of detection was 0.851 nM. When Probe 1 and
H2S underwent a reaction, the solution color had some changes.
These colors changed in terms of the concentration changes of H2S, ranging from colorless to yellow. The Probe 1 test paper only needed to be exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas for
20 s for the color change to occur. Besides, Probe 1–H2S was used to detect water content in dimethyl sulfoxide which
ranged from 0 to 100%. The color change of the solution was opposite
to that of H2S, ranging from yellow to colorless.

Introduction
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a typical active sulfide compound.1,2 H2S is of great importance physiologically and pathophysiologically.3,4 Increased H2S content may increase the risk of various
diseases, including ischemic disease,5 atherosclerosis,6 tumor,7 diabetes,8 and cardiac hypertension.9 As H2S has a characteristic rotten egg smell, excessive
H2S may be detrimental to the flavor of wine.10,11 Commonly, water is regarded as an impurity in organic solvents.
The water content plays an important role in chemical reactions and
industrial fields.12

The Karl Fischer
titration is often adopted for the detection of
water content in organic solvents.13 At
present, by means of a resort to fluorescent probes, water in organic
solvents has been traced and analyzed.13 A slew of ways have been used to detect H2S, ranging
from high-performance liquid chromatography14 and gas chromatography15 to nanomaterial-based
sensors.16,17 Nowadays, fluorescent probes have enticed
people as they can be effective in a short time, highly sensitive,
easy in operation, and convenient for observation.18−28 A lot of H2S-oriented fluorescent probes owing to their
good nucleophilic activity have emerged, such as probes involving
the nucleophilic substitution reactions with 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate,
7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole, and 2,4-dinitrobenzene.29−38 For H2S detection, plenty of organic fluorescent probes
with double sites had been used in aqueous medium and living cells.39−43 However, the dual-function fluorescent probes for the detection
of water content in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and detection of H2S have not been reported.

In light of the above issue,
a fresh probe (Probe 1) is explored in the paper with
a view to detect water content in
DMSO and to detect H2S. Naphthalene is taken as fluorophore
and 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate and aldehyde is selected for the reaction
group. The one-time function relationship between luminescent intensity
of Probe 1–H2S and water content is
conductive to the detection of the water content in DMSO.

Results and Discussion
Probe
Prepared
The esterification reaction of compound 1 with compound 2 is used to generate Probe 1 (Scheme 1). The synthesis
is not complicated and this is true for purification
under the reaction of recrystallization as well. To confirm Probe 1, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), EA, and 1H NMR were used (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of Probe 1
Sensing Properties of Probe 1 toward H2S
The fluorescence response
of Probe 1 to H2S in DMSO (Figure 1a), CH3CN (Figure 1b), and C2H5OH (Figure 1c) solutions was verified.
The fluorescence intensity was detected at 0, 0.5, and 1–30
min after H2S (200 μM, 20 μL) was added. The
fluorescence signal increased rapidly from 0 to 0.5 min, decreased
gradually from 0.5 min, and reached an equilibrium at 11 min in DMSO,
20 min in CH3CN, and 26 min in C2H5OH (Figure 1d). The
fluorescence intensity of Probe 1 increased by almost
1300-fold in DMSO after H2S was added. Probe 1 in DMSO had a faster reaction time and greater fluorescence intensity
changes than in CH3CN and C2H5OH.

Figure 1 (a) Time
response of Probe 1 (10 μM) added to
H2S (200 μM) in DMSO at 25 °C, λex = 425 nm; (b) in CH3CN; (c) in C2H5OH; and (d) time response of Probe 1 added to H2S in different solvents. Repeated three times.

DMSO, CH3CN, and C2H5OH solutions
make a difference in the water content. In these solutions, the fluorescence
response of Probe 1–H2S (10 μM
Probe 1 + 200 μM H2S) was verified.
After Probe 1 (20 μL, 10 μM) and H2S (20 μL, 200 μM) were added to a DMSO–water system
(2 mL), the luminescent intensity was reduced with the increasing
water content and the optical emission spectra were red-shifted (Figure 2a). There was a one-time
function relationship between Probe 1–H2S with the water level (R2 = 0.9963; Figure 2b). As the concentration
of H2O increased (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%), there was
a change from yellow to colorless. The observer could find out this
under natural light (Figure 2c). Regarding the 365 nm ultraviolet lamp, the color changed
from a light blue to blue-green color (Figure 2d). From these data, it could be seen that
the detection of H2O content in DMSO within the range of
0–100% can be completed by the Probe 1 + H2S system. In the CH3CN–water and C2H5OH–water systems, the fluorescence intensity
did not show a concentration-dependent change with the increasing
water content (Figures S3a,b and S4a,b, Supporting Information). The color gradually changed from yellow to colorless,
and it could be seen by the naked eye (Figure S3c, Supporting Information). Under an ultraviolet lamp (365 nm),
the color gradually changed from light blue to blue-green color (Figure
S4c, Supporting Information). As a result,
DMSO was chosen as the most suitable solution for Probe 1 toward H2S, and the best reaction time was 11 min.

level DMSO under ambient light; (d) under 365 nm UV light.

When H2S was gradually added (0, 2,
4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
14, 16, and 18 μM), the maximal ultraviolet absorption peak
of Probe 1 gradually increased (Figure 3a), which was linearly and positively dependent
on the concentration of H2S (R2 = 0.9972; Figure 3b,c). At 487 nm, the luminescent intensity was increased 1300 times.
There was a one-time function relationship between luminescent intensity
and H2S concentration (R2 =
0.9991; Figure 3d).
The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.851 nM (S/N = 3). With the rising
H2S concentration, the solution color changed to yellow
and then deepened. This was seen under natural light by researchers.
When a 365 nm ultraviolet lamp was used, there was an increase in
the fluorescence intensity and there was color change from colorlessness
to light blue (Figure 3f).

three times. (e) Photograph of Probe 1 solutions with

To examine the selectivity of Probe 1 for H2S, some compounds and ions, such as hydrazine, Hcy, PhSH,
ammonia
solution, Cys, H2O2, GSH, NH4+, Na+, Br–, K+, SO32–, Mg2+, Cl–, Ca2+, F–, and I–, were tested. None of these competitors (10 μM) led to a significant
fluorescent response by Probe 1. Moreover, with an addition
of H2S to the solutions with hydrazine, Hcy, PhSH, ammonia
solution, Cys, H2O2, GSH, NH4+, Na+, Br–, K+, SO32–, Mg2+, Cl–, Ca2+, F–, and I–, a competition experiment was carried out. The experiment showed
that the luminescent intensities of Probe 1–H2S and Probe 1 + H2S + competitors
were almost the same (Figure 4). After comparison, it could be found that Probe 1 is an excellent selective tool to detect H2S. Another
finding from the experiment was that there was no negative action
from NH2NH2, PhSH, Cys, Hcy, and GSH.

Mg2+; 18, Ca2+; 19, K+. 10 μM
for H2S). Repeated three times.

Reaction Mechanism
Likely, two reaction paths may contribute
to the response mechanism. Because of the primary response mechanism,
the nucleophile substitution reaction of Probe 1 with
H2S occurred and yielded compound 3 and compound 4 which was turned to compound 1 after protonation
in a direct manner (Scheme 2, route a). Under the action of the secondary response mechanism,
the nucleophilic addition reaction of Probe 1 with H2S was done and brought about compound 7 which
involved in the nucleophile substitution reaction of compound 7 with H2S and yielded compound 6 (Scheme 2, route b). To identify
the mechanism, 1H NMR, HMBC, HPLC, and MS were carried
out.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for Probe 1–H2S
With 1H NMR titration
methods, the response mechanism
between Probe 1 and H2S was determined. As
0.5 equiv H2S was added, proton signals at 10.02 ppm (Hb), 10.40 ppm (Hc), 6.10 (H1) ppm, and
5.16 ppm (H2) appeared. As the concentration of H2S increased to 1 equivalent and 2 equiv, the proton signal at 10.15
ppm (Ha) disappeared and the signals at 5.90 (H3) ppm and 5.10 ppm (H4) appeared (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The proton signal of
Hc disappeared because O–H changed to O–Na.
The proton signals of Hb, Hc, H3,
and H4 were confirmed by HMQC (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). As 0.5 equi H2S was added to compound 1, the proton signals at 6.10
(H1) ppm and 5.16 ppm (H2) did not appear, which
indicates that H2S could not participate in the nucleophilic
addition reaction with compound 1, so compound 1 could not react with H2S to compound 5 (Figure S8, Supporting Information).

The ratio between route a and route b had been calculated using 1H NMR (Figure S5, Supporting Information) of Probe 1–H2S (1:0.5), the ratio
accounting for 1/0.36. Therefore, the primary response mechanism was
the nucleophile substitution reaction of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate
with H2S; the secondary response mechanism was the nucleophilic
addition reaction of aldehyde with H2S and then nucleophile
substitution reaction of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate with H2S.

HPLC was used for the verification of the response mechanism.
With
the addition of 1 equiv H2S, the peak of compound 1 appeared and Probe 1 disappeared, and three
new peaks appeared (Figure S9, Supporting Information). By performing MS, it could be seen that there was a peak at m/z = 171.1855, and this was related to
the compound 1 formation (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The peak at m/z = 199.1293 was related to the compound 3 formation
(Figure S11, Supporting Information). The
peak at m/z = 206.2636 was related
to the compound 6 formation (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The peak at m/z = 458.1605 (M + Na) was related to
compound 7 formation (Figure S13, Supporting Information).

The capture of hydrogen by
the oxygen negative ions of compound 4 to give compound 1 was proved by the fluorescence
intensity of compound 1 and compound 4 (Figure
S14, Supporting Information). The fluorescence
intensity of compound 1 was weak in water (−OH)
but strong in pH 7.4 buffer solution (−O–). This capture was also proved by the fluorescence intensity of
Probe 1 with H2S first increasing and then
decreasing (Figures 1d and 4b). The data laid a foundation for
the detection of H2O content in DMSO via the Probe 1–H2S system because its fluorescence intensity
was decreased as the H2O content increased.

Detection of
H2S
To demonstrate the applicability
of Probe 1, the ability performance of Probe 1 for detecting H2S in water samples was demonstrated and
investigated. Water from the Yellow River, tap water, and mineral
water were added to Probe 1 solution, and the concentration
of H2S was determined in these water samples. Next, different
amounts of H2S (10 and 12 μM) were added and the
recovery values ranged from 98.17 to 102.00% (Table 1). From the data, it could be found that
Probe 1 had capability to detect H2S.

Application
of Probe 1
The test strips
were prepared using our previous approach.23 The test strip was directly exposed to H2S gas. After
20 s, the color of test paper changed to yellow (Figure 5a). Under an ultraviolet lamp
(365 nm), there was obvious luminescence (Figure 5b).

sulfide gas
under skylight; (b) photograph of a test strip exposed to H2S gas under UV light (365 nm); (c) photograph of Probe 1 (10 μM, 20 μL) added to H2S solution (0,
0.01, 0.06, 0.1, 1, and 10 mM) under ambient light; and (d) photograph
of Probe 1 added to H2S solution (0, 0.01,
0.06, 0.1, 1, and 10 mM) under 365 nm UV light.

After Probe 1 (20 μL, 10 μM) was
added
to real hydrogen sulfide solution samples (2 mL), the sample solutions
changed from colorless to yellow (Figure 5c). Under a 365 nm ultraviolet lamp, it changed
from colorless to yellowish green (Figure 5d). The mutation point of color was the third
sample (0.06 mM, 2 mg/L). This concentration (2 mg/L) is a low limit
value of H2S solution for the bathing therapy. All the
above data indicate that Probe 1 had capability to detect
H2S solution.

Conclusions
In summary, a dual-function
fluorescent probe (Probe 1) was prepared to detect H2S and water content in DMSO.
The recognition mechanism of probe to H2S was confirmed.
The discriminative detection of H2S was achieved by comparing
and analyzing the difference in the reaction time and solution color
of Probe 1–H2S. The fluorescence intensity
of Probe 1 was increased by almost 1300-fold when H2S was added. The detection range of Probe 1 to
H2S was 0–20 μM and the LOD was 0.851 nM.
Via the reaction with H2S with different concentrations,
Probe 1 brought color changes from colorlessness to yellow.
The color deepened little by little. The atmosphere was observed by
the researcher under natural light. The vital finding was that the
color of the Probe 1 test paper went through change from
colorlessness to yellow when it was subjected to H2S gas
for 20 s in a direct manner. Furthermore, the water content in DMSO
was determined by Probe 1–H2S in the
range 0–100% and the color change of the solution was opposite
to that of H2S, ranging from yellow to colorless.
