Clofazimine is an antimycobacterial agent that
is routinely used for the treatment of leprosy. Clofazimine has also
been shown to have high clinical potential for the treatment of many
Gram-positive pathogens, including those that exhibit high levels
of antibiotic resistance in the medical community. The use of clofazimine
against these pathogens has largely been limited by the inherently
poor water solubility of the drug substance. In this work, the possibility
of repurposing and reformulating clofazimine to maximize its clinical
potential is investigated. To achieve this, the potential of novel
salt forms of clofazimine as supersaturating drug-delivery vehicles
to enhance the aqueous solubility and gastrointestinal solubility
of the drug substance was explored. The solution properties of seven
novel salt forms, identified during an initial screening process,
were examined in water and in a gastrointestinal-like media and were
compared and contrasted with those of the free base, clofazimine,
and the commercial formulation of the drug, Lamprene. The stability
of the most promising solid forms was tested, and their bioactivity
against Staphylococcus aureus was also
compared with that of the clofazimine free base and Lamprene. Salts
forms which showed superior stability as well as solubility and activity
to the commercial drug formulation were fully characterized using
a combination of spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray diffraction,
solid-state NMR, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance
(AR) is a prominent global threat which
has been accelerated by decades of constant selection pressures from
the human use of antibiotic resources.1−3 It has been estimated
that if action is not taken to slow the spread of AR, the financial
cost to the global economy between now and 2050 will be around $100
trillion as well as result in the loss of countless human lives.4,5 AR has resulted in the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains
of dangerous pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and Staphylococcus aureus,1−3 as well as an increase in drug resistance among bacteria that cause
common healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).1−3 HAIs are largely
the product of 19 pathogens that have developed worrying levels of
resistance and are now capable of causing serious and difficult-to-treat
infections.1 Six of these pathogens are
known by the acronym “ESKAPE” and are the most common
cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections amongst the critically
ill and immunocomprised.5−9

There have been many suggestions on how best to tackle the
looming
AR problem, and the generation of novel antimicrobial agents with
new and specific modes of actions is often suggested as the solution.10 Such an approach is likely to take decades for
sufficient numbers of new antimicrobial drug substances to be identified
and to get regulatory approval to treat the ever increasing number
of pathogens that are showing dangerous levels of resistance.6 A more immediate strategy is to repurpose existing
drug substances to fill the antibiotic discovery void until new treatments
become available.6 This has proven successful
in the past, for example, with the administration of β-lactamases
inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid, along with β-lactamases
antibiotics such as amoxicillin.6,11,12 Recently, researchers have begun to screen libraries of Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs against biological threats
in vitro. Madrid et al. screened 1012 regulatory-approved drugs against
various viral and bacterial agents, resulting in the identification
of 333 unique hits,13 Chopra et al. identified
five compounds that showed significant antibiotic activity against
drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii,(14) and Kim et al. discovered 15 approved
drugs that were able to kill Candida albicans in vitro, one of which showed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity.15

Clofazimine (CFZ) is an antimicrobial
drug that is currently employed
as part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) triple drug
regimen for the treatment of leprosy.16 CFZ is known to exhibit good in vitro activity against most Gram-positive
bacteria species, including strains that are multidrug resistant,
with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the range 0.5–2
mg/L in most cases.17 Gram-negative bacteria,
on the other hand, are uniformly resistant to CFZ.17,18 Gram-positive bacteria susceptible to CFZ include the aforementioned
ESKAPE pathogens, Enterococcus faecium and S. aureus, as well as several
pathogens which contribute to HAIs, namely Clostridium
difficile, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.(17−24) CFZ is also categorized as a group 5 medicine for the treatment
of extensively drug-resistant TB and is included on the WHO list of
essential medicines for both adults and children.17,25,26 The clinical use of CFZ in the treatment
of many pathogens has been greatly limited due to its poor aqueous
solubility (<0.01 mg/L).16,17,27,28 The limited water solubility
and high lipophilicity (log P = 7.66) of CFZ
result in the accumulation of this drug substance in fatty tissue.27,29−31 However, the antimicrobial potential of CFZ has resulted
in a renewal of interest in the drug in recent times, and in 2016
CFZ was re-patented for the treatment of Clostridium
difficile infections in humans.32,33 Despite the reports of good activity in vitro, CFZ has consistently
performed poorly in vivo.17 For example,
CFZ has never been successfully used in the treatment of MDR-TB despite
being reportedly active against the pathogen in vitro and being recommended
by the WHO to this end.17,28 To overcome the poor
water solubility of CFZ, in vitro bioactivity assays are usually carried
out using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solubilizing agent.17,19,23,28,34−37 Thus, the poor correlation between
in vitro and in vivo activities is likely related to the poor water
solubility of CFZ. If the aqueous solubility of CFZ could be improved,
then the therapeutic potential of this drug substance might be reached
in vivo.

Formulation strategies to improve solubility are broadly
characterized
as either solubilizing strategies (i.e., formulation with solubilizing
agents) or supersaturating drug-delivery systems (SDDS).38,39 The latter involves the administration of high-energy solid forms,
such as amorphous solids, crystalline salts or cocrystals and allows
the generation of supersaturated solutions.38,39 The main disadvantage of these systems is their tendency to precipitate
from solution and to revert to the equilibrium solubility of a more
stable solid form.38,39 Several previous attempts to
address the aqueous solubility of CFZ have been made with varying
degrees of success. These included solubilizing strategies, such as
the formulation of CFZ with bile salts,40 encapsulation of the drug into liposomes,41,42 formulation with water-soluble polymer carriers,43−45 conjugation
onto modified cyclodextrin,46 and formulation
as amorphous solid dispersions.47 The failure
of these previous studies was likely due to the large hydrophobic
structure of the CFZ molecules, and it associated inherently poor
aqueous solubility. Of the various SDDS approaches, the use of crystalline
salts is arguably the most well known. In the pharmaceutical industry,
salt formation has become a commonly applied technique for increasing
solubility and dissolution rates during the drug product development
process.48 The resulting crystalline salts
dissociate in solution to form ionized species that are more soluble
in water compared to the unionized molecules.38,48 Even without crystallization inhibitors, pharmaceutical salts often
generate supersaturation levels where precipitation out of solution
is slow enough to improve drug bioavailability.49 CFZ itself is a weak base (pKa = 8.51129) and has previously been shown
to readily form salts with a variety of acid coformers and with acidic
polymers forming ionic solid dispersions.50,51 The salts were characterized, and their solution properties were
studied in a dissolution medium of ethanol and water. This choice
of media may have been due to the poor aqueous solubility of these
CFZ salts, and the choice of counterion had no apparent rationality.
In this study, the optimal solid form of CFZ is isolated based on
its solubility and supersaturation in water and, more importantly,
in a gastrointestinal-like environment. This should maximize the potential
of the resulting solid form to increase absorption in the gastrointestinal
tract and thus improve the bioavailability of the drug.

Results and Discussion
To improve the aqueous solubility of CFZ, a systematic screening
process for new salt forms of the drug was developed based on supersaturation
potential in water and in gastrointestinal-like media (Scheme 1). Acid coformers were selected
such that ΔpKa, the difference between
the pKa values of the acid coformers and
that of CFZ (pKa = 8.51129), remained greater than 2 pKa units (Table 1).
This is in keeping with the hypothesis that if ΔpKa is greater than 2, salt formation occurs.50,52 During these slurry experiments,
the formation of a novel solid phase was confirmed by powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) (Figure 1).

monitoring of the solid phase present via vacuum filtration and PXRD.

Solution Properties of
CFZ Solid Forms in Water
Following
the identification of these new solid forms via PXRD, their melting
points and solution properties in deionized water were studied (Figure 2, Table 2). From these supersaturation
profiles values for maximum supersaturation (Smax), the time to reach Smax (tSmax) and initial
dissolution rate (Dinitial) were obtained
and are compared in Table 2. In deionized water, each new solid form of CFZ increased
the aqueous concentration of CFZ, whereas the CFZ polymorphs or the
commercial formulation (Lamprene) did not dissolve to any detectable
extent (detection limit < 0.1 mg/L) (Figure 2). The order of supersaturation (relative
to CFZ F III) for these salts observed in deionized water was seen
to be phosphate > sulfate > acetate > formate > citrate
> oxalate
> nitrate > chloride ≫ CFZ (free base)/Lamprene. Following
the dissolution of the various solid forms, de-supersaturation and
precipitation occurred, removing CFZ from solution. The rate of precipitation
from solution differed depending on the solid form administrated and
the resulting supersaturation level in solution. For each new solid
form administered to deionized water, the solid form precipitating
out of solution was always found to be the triclinic polymorph of
CFZ, F I (Figure 3).
Crystallization of CFZ F I can only happen following the deprotonation
of the CFZH+ solution species back to the unionized free
base species, CFZ. Thus, the rate of precipitation likely depends
on the rate at which CFZH+ converts back to CFZ. The unprotonated
CFZ species is highly insoluble in water and therefore there is a
strong driving force for it to crystallize. Interestingly, of the
four CFZ polymorphs known, CFZ F I is the least thermodynamically
stable and thus the first available crystal structure, according to
the Oswald rule of stages.53

Solution Properties
of CFZ Solid Form in FaSSGF
The
solid forms with the best aqueous solubility, i.e., sulfate, phosphate,
citrate, formate and acetate, were then screened for supersaturation
potential in fasted-state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF), where
they were once again compared with CFZ F I and the commercial formulation,
Lamprene. From these supersaturation profiles, values for Smax, tSmax, and Dinitial were
obtained for FaSSGF and are also presented in Table 2. The maximum supersaturation in FaSSGF followed
the order, phosphate > sulfate > citrate > acetate > Lamprene
> formate
> CFZ F I, and these results are shown in Figure 4. In the FaSSGF media, there was also a stark
reduction in the amount of CFZ that could be held in solution, or Smax, compared to that in deionized water (Table 2). The phosphate and
sulfate salts, which reach concentrations as high as 104 and 82 mg/L
respectively, in deionized water, struggled to surpass 20 mg/L in
FaSSGF, and the stability of the resulting solutions was poor (Figure 4, Table 2). This apparent supersaturation
limit of ∼20 mg/L was common across all novel salts of CFZ
administered to FaSSGF media (Figure 4). Moreover, regardless of which solid form of CFZ
was administered into the FaSSGF, the solid form which precipitated
out of solution was found to be a hydrochloride salt of CFZ (Figure 3). The driving force
for the observed conversion into the hydrochloric acid salt is likely
the high chloride concentration of the FaSSGF. The fact that the CFZ
F I also converts to the hydrochloric acid salt suggests that this
salt form is a more thermodynamically stable crystalline form of the
drug in the high chloride content of the FaSSGF media. De-supersaturation
and crystallization from solution happened much faster for the salts
in FaSSGF as compared to deionized water, and again this is likely
due to the high chloride concentration of the FaSSGF. These findings
are in agreement with a previous study in which this hydrochloride
acid salt was first identified and was shown to be the form in which
CFZ accumulates in animal tissues31 but
contradicts dissolution studies carried out on amorphous CFZ loaded onto silica nanoparticles in a different
gastrointestinal-like media.54 In FaSSGF
media, the phosphate and sulfate salts reached the highest concentration
but also precipitated out of solution faster than the citrate and
acetate salts (Figure 4). Solution stability of all salts in the FaSSGF media appeared to
be limited by supersaturation. If the concentration increased above
∼20 mg/L, rapid de-supersaturation occurred (Figure 4). The citrate and acetate
salts maintain their supersaturation levels in FaSSGF better than
the sulfate and phosphate, as they do not exceed this critical concentration
threshold of ∼20 mg/L. The rapid onset of crystallization,
which repeatedly occurs above a concentration of 20 mg/L, must be
due to the supersaturation level entering the labile zone, where spontaneous
nucleation occurs. Thus, there appears to be an inherent instability
to solutions of CFZH+ in this FaSSGF medium at concentrations
above 20 mg/L.

CFZ salts
with CFZ F I and the commercial formulation of the drug (Lamprene).

Solution Properties of
CFZ Solid Form in FaSSIF
One
common failure of salt forms of basic drugs is their tendency to precipitate
from solution in the more basic conditions of the intestinal tract.
The intestine is the major location for the absorption of oral drugs,
and thus dissolution and supersaturation properties in FaSSIF are
arguably more relevant than in FaSSGF. Given the adequate stability
and enhanced solution behavior of the phosphate, sulfate and citrate
salts in FaSSGF, the solution properties of these three salts were
examined in FaSSIF, where they were compared with CFZ F I and Lamprene
(Figure 5). From their
dissolution profiles, values for Smax, tSmax, and Dinitial were obtained as before and are presented
in Table 2. In FaSSIF,
the citrate, phosphate and sulfate salts all showed improved dissolution
profiles compared to those of Lamprene or CFZ F I and supersaturation
in this media followed the order, citrate > phosphate > sulfate
>
Lamprene > CFZ F I. Compared to the FaSSGF media, there was a significant
reduction in the dissolution rates of the CFZ salts in FaSSIF and
a significant reduction in the amount of CFZ which went into solution
in the more basic FaSSIF (Figure 5 and Table 2). This was, however, unsurprising, as the fast dissolution
rates associated with salt forms of basic drugs is a result of differences
in the pH of the diffusion layer of the salt and the pH of the bulk
media.55 If the latter is changed, then
the dissolution rate of the salt in that media will consequently change.
It was found to be CFZ F I, or the basic form of the drug, that precipitated
from solution in the FaSSIF and not the chloride salt, as was the
case in the lower pH FaSSGF media. This was unsurprising as significant
work has been done to show how salts of basic drugs will convert to
and precipitate from solution as their respective free bases above
some theoretical pH value, termed pHmax.55 In the FaSSGF media, the high chloride concentration and
fast dissolution rate of the salts result in a critical concentration
of CFZH+ being reached around ∼20 mg/L, which results
in rapid de-supersaturation. However, in the FaSSIF media, the maximum
solution concentration reached was ∼10 mg/mL and thus de-supersaturation
occurs slower even though the chloride concentration is higher. Chlorine
concentration in the FaSSIF appears to have no effect on solution
stability as it is CFZ F I and not the hydrochloride salt of CFZ which
precipitates. Thus, the crystallization of CFZ F I from solution in
FaSSIF is not driven by
the common ion effect, as was the case in FaSSGF.

Figure 5 Comparison of the dissolution
profiles in FaSSIF of CFZ salts with
CFZ F I and the commercial formulation of the drug (Lamprene).

Antimicrobial Activity
of Novel Salts
The antimicrobial
activity of CFZ F I was compared to that of the salts that exhibited
acceptable solution properties in FaSSGF and FaSSIF and long-term
stability, i.e., the phosphate, sulfate, and citrate salts. These
solid forms were tested for activity against S. aureus, and this data is presented in Figure 6. As mentioned previously, CFZ is routinely
used in the treatment of leprosy; however, it has also been reported
to display activity against S. aureus at concentrations of less than 5 μg/mL,23,56 albeit in the presence of DMSO, which acts as a solubilizing agent.
During the microtiter activity studies of CFZ F I and the citrate,
phosphate, and sulfate salts, varying degrees of inhibition of bacterial
growth against S. aureus were observed.
There was no inhibition of bacterial growth from bacteria incubated
in the presence of CFZ F I at either 20 or 40 μg/mL (Figure 6). Bacterial growth
initially was slower with the citrate salts for up to ∼8 h;
however, final populations were similar in numbers to those of the
control and therefore no MIC50 was determined (Figure 6). Similarly, initial
growth of the bacteria in the presence of the sulfate salt at 20 μg/mL
was much lower than that of the control; however, final populations
after 24 h were similar (Figure 6). The sulfate salt caused a significant decrease in
bacterial population when compared to that of the control at 24 h,
giving an MIC50 of 40 μg/mL. In the case of the phosphate
salts, an MIC50 was established at 20 μg/mL over
the 24 h analysis when compared with the control (Figure 6). Although not all of the
salts exhibited sufficient killing for the determination of a MIC50 value, each of them showed an improvement in activity against S. aureus when compared with CFZ F I. Indeed, without
DMSO present in the assay to solubilize the CFZ, no activity was noted
against S. aureus for the free base.
There is a trend in the literature where antimicrobial activity assays
for hydrophobic drugs such as CFZ are usually carried out by dissolving
the drug substance in DMSO or ethanol, thereby overcoming the hydrophobic
nature of the drug for the sake of the in vitro assay.17,19,23,28,34−37 The results of such tests has
led to a library of low MIC values for CFZ against a range of different
pathogens.17,19,23,28,34−37 Yet, in vivo activity data has remained largely inconclusive and
these discrepancies have been alluded to in a recent review.17 The salt forms of CFZ isolated here overcome
the hydrophobic nature of the pure drug temporarily, resulting in
enhanced killing against S. aureus.

incubated with the drugs for 24 h at 37 °C.

Solid-State Characterization
The solid forms generated
in solutions with phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and citric acid
coformers, having the best solution properties in the FaSSGF medium,
were characterized using a combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (SSNMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and stability testing. For a new solid form
to make it from the lab to the market, it must be stable under storage
conditions for prolonged periods of time. The salts with the most
promising solubility in FaSSGF, i.e., the acetate, citrate, phosphate,
and sulfate, were exposed to the FDA-recommended accelerated stability
testing conditions.57 The results of these
stability tests are summarized in Figure 7. The phosphate, citrate, and sulfate salts
retained their respective structures under these conditions for the
duration of the test (3 months). The acetate salt did not retain its
structure during the testing and was seen to undergo a phase transformation
into the monoclinic polymorph, CFZ F II, during the first week of
the test. When a sample of the acetate salt was heated up to around
100 °C, it was found that acetate molecules evaporated to leave
CFZ F II (Figure 8).
Thus, the acetate salt would be unlikely to have a drug delivery application
due to its poor stability and was excluded from further studies.

diffractograms of the CFZ-acetate solid

Salts are defined by the transfer
of a hydrogen atom from an acid
to a base and thus the formation of an ionic bond.58,59 The challenge in characterizing a salt from a cocrystal stems from
the difficulty in clearly defining hydrogen atom positions using XRD,
although recently it has been suggested that in some cases, hydrogen
atom positions can be accurately defined to within one standard deviation
using the Hirshfeld atom refinement computational analysis.60 Nevertheless, it is also possible to characterize
ionic bond formation indirectly using spectroscopic techniques, such
as FTIR and NMR, as well as by monitoring changes in the crystal structures
caused by protonation of molecules.

Crystallographic data obtained
from single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SCXRD) experiments for the citrate, sulfate and phosphate is summarized
in Table 3. For each
of these salts, there was good correlation between the experimental
PXRD diffractograms and those calculated from the single-crystal structures
(Figure 9). The crystal
structures of these salts and the previously reported CFZ polymorphs
were analyzed using the Cambridge Structural Databank (CSD) software,
Mercury. The bonding angle of the secondary ketimine groups (C=NC–C) in each crystal was measured. The bond angle C=NC–C, which undergoes protonation, was seen to increase
from around 120° in each polymorph of CFZ to around 125°
in each of the salt forms (Figure 10). However, the bond angle C–NB=C,
which does not become protonated, remained unchanged in the range 118–119° in the various solid
forms. Once protonated, the central nitrogen (NC), of the
secondary ketimine (C=NC–C), develops a +1
charge and a new coordination number of 3, which explains the observed
increase of the C=NC–C bond angle by about
5°. This increase in the bond angle was observed in the structure
of each salt characterized here and is consistent with observations
made during previous studies on the crystal structures of salts formed
between pyridine derivatives and acidic coformers.61 When previously reported CFZ salts were analyzed in this
way, a similar increase in the C=NC–C bonding
angle was noted.50

FTIR and SSNMR spectroscopy
were used to further validate this
salt formation hypothesis. Ionic bonds themselves do not resonate
in the presence of infrared radiation, so FTIR spectroscopy was used
to probe for a new NC+–H bond in the potential salt forms and to monitor
the stretching of the C=NC double bond of the ketimine
group. The FTIR spectra obtained for the different CFZ polymorphs
were found to be indistinguishable (Figure S2), and thus only F III was compared with the potential salt forms.
The presence of the new NC+–H bond for each salt form was observable
in the range 3250–3350 cm–1, and by comparison,
no such peak was present in the free base (CFZ F III) (Figure 11). Protonation of NC caused a bathochromic shift in the peak representative of the C=NC double bond (1626.5 cm–1, in F III) to
a lower wavenumber in each salt form of CFZ (Figure 11). This movement to a lower wavenumber indicates
a weakening this C=NC double bond, giving further
proof of protonation. These observations are consistent with accounts
of reported ionic bond formation between CFZ and hypromellose phthalate as well as in other salts of CFZ with acidic
coformers.50,51 A comparison of the full FTIR
spectra for these solid forms can be found in the Supporting Information
(Table S1, Figure S2).

Figure 11 Overlay of the FTIR
spectra of CFZ F III with sulfate, phosphate
and citrate salts, showing evidence for (a) new NC–H
bond formation in the range 3350–3250 cm–1 and (b) weakening of C=NC bond following protonation
in the range 1650–1600 cm–1.

SSNMR was used to investigate changes in the chemical
shifts of
the carbon atoms of CFZ following salt formation. The peak positions
of the carbon atoms in CFZ and its respective salt forms were assigned
through a combination of molecular modeling and solution NMR. These
peak assignments were in agreement with previous studies.27,51,6213C cross-polarization
magic-angle spinning (CPMAS) solid-state NMR spectra were collected
for the phosphate, sulfate and citrate salts as well as CFZ F III.
During these 13C CPMAS experiments, the chemical shift
of the ketimine carbons (NB=C and NC=C)
were monitored in the range 140–155 ppm, whereas the chemical
shift of the isopropyl carbon adjacent to NC was monitored
in the range 40–65 ppm. The resulting peak position from the 13C CPMAS spectra is shown in Figure 12. A full comparison of the 13C CPMAS spectra for these salts with CFZ F III can be found in the Supporting Information as well as a table of
the chemical shifts of the carbon atoms bound to the nitrogen atoms
in the secondary ketimine functional groups of CFZ, i.e., C=NC–C and C–NB=C, and their respective
bond lengths from the crystal structures of solid form (Table S2, Figure S3). These new salts of CFZ
had several drug molecules in their unit cells, some of these being
chemically inequivalent, leading to broad or several peaks for individual
carbons in the 13C CPMAS spectra (Figure S3). In general, following salt formation, the chemical shift
of the isopropyl carbon (NC–C) shifted upfield (Figure 12), indicating shielding
of this carbon nucleus from the magnetic field of the spectrometer.
This shielding is likely due to electron density being donated from
the adjacent methyl groups in response to the protonation of NC. A similar upfield shift was seen for the ketimine carbon
bonded to NC (C=NC) (Figure 12). This shift is expected
due to electron density migrating from the phenazine nucleus toward
the protonated nitrogen (NC+–H), causing local shielding of the
ketimine carbon (C=NC). By comparison, the carbon
atom in the conjugated ketimine (C–NB=C)
did not shift upfield following protonation and was seen to be resonant
at ∼151 ppm in the four CFZ salts (Figure 12). These observations are in agreement with
previous studies where protonation of NC in CFZ occurring
from HPMCP resulted in similar upfield shifts in the chemical shift
of these ketimine carbons.51

Figure 12 Comparison
of the 13C CPMAS spectra obtained for the
citrate, phosphate, and sulfate salts with CFZ F III (top) in the
range 140–155 ppm to monitor the chemical shift of the ketimine
carbons highlighted and (bottom) in the range 40–65 ppm, to
monitor the chemical shift of the isopropyl carbon highlighted.

Thus, the increase in C=NC–C bonding angle
following interaction with acidic coformers, the subsequent weakening
of the C=NC bond, and presence of a new NC–H bond in the FTIR spectra of these solid forms, as well
as the shielding of both the ketimine carbon and the isopropyl carbon
adjacent to the protonation site (C=NC–C)
indicate that salt formation occurs between phosphoric acid, sulfuric
acid, and citric acid with CFZ, as was suspected from the ΔpKa of CFZ with these acid coformers.50,52

Conclusions
Novel solid forms of drugs are of value
provided that, compared
with the existing solid forms, their physicochemical properties are
more favorable. For many drugs, solubility and dissolution rates are
properties that will determine the drug bioavailability in vivo, and
thus being able to manipulate these properties is of great importance.
Eight salts of CFZ were identified using an in situ salt screening
approach during this work, seven of which were novel salts, and three
of these were then selected for further characterization based on
their solubility and dissolution rates in simulated gastrointestinal
fluids. The CFZ salts exhibited fast dissolution rate and enhanced
solution properties in the low pH FaSSGF media, but there was an intrinsic
instability to supersaturated solutions of CFZH+ above
∼20 mg/L in this medium. In the FaSSIF media, each salt tested
showed a much reduced dissolution rate and a lower maximum solution
concentration compared to those in FaSSGF media. This was due to the
higher pH of the FaSSIF. However, in every case, the CFZ salts exhibited
increased dissolution rates and increased solution concentrations
compared with the commercial formulation or the basic drug. The improved
solubility profiles of the sulfate, phosphate, and citrate CFZ salts
also enhanced killing against S. aureus compared with the free base (CFZ F I) in vitro. Thus, supersaturating
delivery systems can improve the solubility and antimicrobial activity
of CFZ in vitro but whether this is sufficient to enable the antimicrobial
potential of CFZ in vivo remains to be seen.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Clofazimine (CAS registry number 2030-63-9)
was purchased from Beijing Mesochem Technology Co., Ltd. Coformers,
including hydrochloric acid (37%, Sigma-Aldrich), sulfuric acid (95–97%,
Sigma-Aldrich), nitric acid (70%, Sigma-Aldrich), oxalic acid anhydrous
(>99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ortho-phosphoric acid (85%,
Sigma-Aldrich), citric acid monohydrate (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
formic
acid (acetic acid (>95%, Sigma-Aldrich)), and acetic acid (99.8%,
Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received. Methanol (>99%) being of
HPLC
grade and used without further purification was also purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Ingredients for the dissolution media; pepsin (extracted
from porcine mucosa, Amresco), sodium taurocholate hydrate (NaTc,
>97%, Sigma-Aldrich), L-α-phosphatidylcholine (lecithin,
∼
99% purity, from bovine brain, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium chloride (Fisher
Scientific), maleic acid (>99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and hydrochloric
acid
(37%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received from suppliers. Brain Heart
Infusion Broth (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a medium for bioactivity
assays.

Screening for Salt Formation
Ten milliliters of 1 M
acid solution was placed into 20 mL vials along with a magnetic stir
bar and 100 mg of CFZ (F I). The resulting suspensions were stirred
at 400 rpm for 24 h, at which point the solid form was monitored.
Twenty milligrams of the solid was removed, dried under vacuum, and
then immediately analyzed using reflection PXRD.

Preparation
of Salts
One gram of CFZ (F I) and 1.2
equiv of coformer were added to a 100 mL Duran flask containing 50
mL of methanol. The solution was slurried for 24 h and then filtered
under vacuum. The resulting crystalline powder was placed in an oven
at 40 °C overnight to dry.

Growth of Single Crystals
Hundred milligrams of CFZ
F I and coformer (1:1 molar ratio) were added to 100 mL of methanol
and heated to 50 °C and stirred at 600 rpm for 1 h. The solution
was then filtered (using preheated syringe and filter) into a second
100 mL Duran flask, which had been preheated to 50 °C, sealed
with parafilm, and pierced with a single hole. The solution was left
to cool and evaporated until ∼25 mL of solvent remained, which point the crystals were harvested under vacuum.

Preparation
of Simulated Body Fluid (FaSSGF and FaSSIF)
Fasted-state
simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF) was prepared at pH
1.6 using a previously reported recipe,63 with a small modification to control the final chloride-ion concentration.
The final composition of the FaSSGF consisted of pepsin (0.1 mg/mL),
sodium taurocholate (80 μM), lecithin (20 μM), sodium
chloride (7.2 mM), and hydrochloric acid (25 mM). Fasted-state simulated
intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) was prepared at pH 6.5, in accordance with
a recipe previously reported by Marques et al.64 The final composition of the FaSSIF consisted of sodium
taurocholate (3 mM), lecithin (0.2 mM), maleic acid (19.12 mM), sodium
hydroxide (34.8 mM), and sodium chloride (68.62 mM).

Supersaturation
Studies on CFZ Solid Forms
Dissolution
experiments were carried out in deionized water, FaSSGF, and FaSSIF.
These experiments were conducted in 100 mL Duran flasks containing
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) stir bars and 100 mL of dissolution
medium. Solutions were stirred at 150 rpm on a submersible stir plate
in a water bath at 37 °C. All samples were ground and passed
through particle size sieves (Fisher scientific) to obtain a particle
size distribution of 63–90 μm. Following grinding and
sieving of the solids, reflection PXRD confirmed no change in their
solid form. For the dissolution experiments, samples containing 20
mg of CFZ were added to the dissolution medium. The flask was inverted
several times due to the poor wettability of CFZ. Samples were withdrawn
at predetermined time intervals using preheated (40 °C) 5 mL
syringes and hypodermic needles and then filtered using preheated
(40 °C) PTFE syringe filters (0.2 μm, 25 mm diameter, Fisher
Scientific). The CFZ concentration was then immediately determined
using a double beam UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1800)
at a detection wavelength of 488 nm. For calibration of the instrument,
standard solutions were prepared in the concentration range 0.1–20
mg/L and good linearity was observed (R2 > 0.999).

Slurry Experiments to Monitor Solid Form
Slurry experiments
were carried out in the various dissolution media to determine the
solid phase present during and after the dissolution experiments.
Fifty milligrams of the solid sample was added to 20 mL of the dissolution
medium to mimic supersaturation conditions of the dissolution experiments.
This was inverted several times and then stirred on a submersible
stir plate at 150 rpm and 37 °C. Solid samples were removed via
filtration under vacuum at predetermined time points and characterized
by reflection PXRD.

Stability Testing of Optimal Salt Forms
Accelerated
stability testing was carried out for selected CFZ salts at 40 °C/75%
relative humidity in a sealed humidity chamber. Glass vials, without
caps, containing 20–30 mg of a salt were kept in the humidity
chamber and then removed at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
Upon removal, each solid sample was characterized via PXRD, where
full retention of the PXRD pattern indicated compound stability.

Antibacterial Activity Assays
The minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) against S. aureus (DSMZ 20231) was calculated using a microtiter assay. More specifically,
the minimum concentration required to kill 50% of the bacterial population,
the MIC50, in this case after 24 h, was calculated. An
overnight culture was grown up in Brain Heart Infusion Broth at 37
°C, shaking at 250 rpm. First, the CFZ F I and CFZ salts were
dissolved/suspended in water and shaken at room temperature for 10
min. Following this, the drug solution/suspension was added to a 96-well
plate to give a final concentration of 20 or 40 μg/mL of CFZ
in each well. Sterile water was added to each well to bring the volume
to 20 μL. Then, 180 μL of the diluted bacterial culture
(OD = 0.1) was added, so the total volume in each well was 200 μL.
Blanks were set up with media only and media plus different test concentrations
of each salt. Control wells were also set up with bacterial culture
only. The 96-well plates were incubated in a Biotek ELx808 Ultra microplate
reader (Mason Technologies, Dublin, Ireland) at 37 °C for 24
h, and wavelength was read at 590 nm. The plate was shaken mildly
before each reading, and readings were taken every 30 min. Three wells
were set up for each test concentration, control and blank.

Solid-State
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed
using an Empyrean
diffractometor (PANalytical, Phillips) in reflection mode, with Cu
Kα radiation (γ = 1.5406 Å) operating at 40 kV and
40 mA and at room temperature. Samples were scanned from 4 to 35°
(2θ) at 4 rpm and scan conditions of a scan step size of 0.0131°
(2θ) and 48.195 s per step.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(SCXRD) measurements were collected
at room temperature (299.86 K), on a Bruker Quest D8 Mo Sealed Tube
(λ = 0.71073 Å), equipped with a CMOS Photon Detector.
Data were corrected for absorption using empirical methods (SADABS)
based upon symmetry-equivalent reflections combined with measurements
at different azimuthal angles. Crystal structures were solved and
refined against all F2 values using the
SHELX interfaced with the X-SEED program. Nonhydrogen atoms were refined
anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions
refined using idealized geometries (riding model) and assigned fixed
isotropic displacement parameters.

Melting points of solid forms
were determined using a Stuart melting
point apparatus (SMP10). Solid samples in the size range 63–90
μm were added into capillary tubes and heated until melting
was observed.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the
solid samples
were collected on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer equipped
with a Universal ATR sampling accessory (single reflection and diamond/zinc
selenide material). Spectra for each solid form were collected at
room temperature using an average of 32 scans and a spectral resolution
of 4 cm–1 in the spectral region 4000–650
cm–1.

Carbon-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (SSNMR) spectra
were acquired on a Bruker Avance III HD NMR spectrometer operating
at B0 = 9.4 T, with corresponding 1H and 13C resonance frequencies of ν0(1H) = 400.1 MHz and ν0(13C) = 100.6 MHz. CFZ solid forms were packed in 4 mm o.d. zirconia
rotors with Kel-F caps under ambient atmosphere, and experimental 13C NMR spectra were acquired at natural abundance using a
4 mm triple channel (H/X/Y) Bruker MAS probe operating in double resonance
mode. The magic angle was optimized using a rotor packed with KBr
and spun at 5 kHz. NMR spectra were referenced to TMS at δiso = 0 ppm by setting the high frequency 13C resonance
in adamantane to 38.48 ppm.65 The 13C CPMAS NMR spectra were acquired in a single spectral window
using the cross-polarization pulse sequence, with a magic-angle spinning
(MAS) rotor frequency of 10 kHz, a 1H 90° pulse width
of 2.5 μs, and 50 kHz 1H decoupling during acquisition.
Proton decoupling was carried out with the SPINAL6466 decoupling sequence at 100%. For each sample, the 1H T1 relaxation time(s) were checked
using the saturation recovery pulse sequence to ensure that the recycle
delay allowed for adequate relaxation between the collection of subsequent
transients. 13C CPMAS spectra were collected using optimized contact
times (2.5 μs) and relaxation delays (at least 1.4 × T1 values) for each sample. The optimized parameters
for CFZ F III were a contact time of 2 ms, relaxation delay of 6 s,
and 128 scans; for CFZ phosphate, contact time was 3 ms, relaxation
delay 2 s, and 500 scans; for CFZ citrate, contact time was 4 ms,
relaxation delay 7 s, and 500 scans; for CFZ sulfate, contact time
was 1 ms, relaxation delay 3 s, and 500 scans.
