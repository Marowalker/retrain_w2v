In this study, a simple one-pot method
was proposed to synthesize
water-soluble nucleoside-templated fluorescent silver nanoparticles
(Ag NPs) and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The nucleoside-templated
fluorescent Ag NPs and Au NPs were further characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), and fluorescence spectroscopy (FLS). The effects of the molar
ratio of reactants, reaction environment, and nucleotides on the synthesis
of Ag NPs and Au NPs were also discussed. The results showed that
nucleoside and ascorbic acid acted as a stabilizer and reductant,
respectively, in the synthesis of Ag NPs and Au NPs, while citrate
buffer acted as both a pH regulator and reductant. The synthesized
nucleoside-templated fluorescent Ag NPs and Au NPs have good fluorescence
stability and easy water solubility. In this study, a simple one-pot
method was proposed to synthesize water-soluble nucleoside-templated
fluorescent silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and gold nanoparticles (Au
NPs).

1 Introduction
In
recent years, fluorescent noble metal nanomaterials stabilized
by nucleosides have become one of the most popular fluorescent nanomaterials
due to their stable photochemical properties, adjustable fluorescence
spectra, and good biocompatibility.1−3 With the rapid development
of nanoscience and nanotechnology, nucleosides are not confined to
some surface functions. Many studies have reported that nucleosides
are excellent templates (scaffolds) for the preparation of fluorescent
nanomaterials, which broaden the methods for the preparation of nanomaterials
and promote biochemical analysis.1,4−6 At present, the main research areas are as follows: quantum dots
prepared with nucleosides as templates, but their wide application
is inevitably hindered by the toxic side effects of quantum dots themselves;7,8 fluorescent copper nanoparticles prepared with single/double chains
as templates have gradually attracted the attention of researchers
in the field of biochemistry, but the problems of poor optical stability
and stringent buffer solution requirements are serious.9,10 The application of fluorescent silver nanoclusters and gold nanoclusters
with nucleoside stabilization have been studied extensively. Their
advantages such as mild preparation conditions, good optical properties,
and good biocompatibility make them widely used in analysis and detection.11−13

Nucleoside-templated fluorescent Ag NPs and Au NPs have been
extensively
studied because of their good biocompatibility, stable antiaggregation,
large Stokes shift, and high emissivity.14−17 Generally speaking, the reduction
of metal ions in aqueous solution will lead to the formation of larger
nanoparticles rather than smaller nanoclusters because nanoclusters
will form aggregates over a long period of time. Therefore, it is
of great significance to select suitable agents, which can stabilize
the formation of nanoclusters and enhance their fluorescence properties,
so as to obtain metal nanoclusters with small particles and high fluorescence.13,18−20 Because of the strong interaction between mercaptan
and Ag/Au, the main stabilizers reported at present are mainly those
containing a small-molecule mercaptan and dendrimers, which are chosen
as stabilizers based on their retention capacity. Polymers and biological
macromolecules with rich carboxylic acid groups, such as peptides,
proteins, and DNA, also interact strongly with metal cations.21−24 Studies have shown that metal ions have high affinity for cytosine
bases in nucleosides, so nucleotides containing cytosine bases become
good stabilizers for the preparation of metal nanoclusters.25 Liu and co-workers26 found that gold nanoclusters with blue fluorescence could be prepared
by citrate as a reductant in the presence of DNA containing multiple
cytosine bases at low pH. In addition, Petty and co-workers27 found that base groups also had some effect
on the formation of silver nanoclusters. Although DNA-templated fluorescent
silver/gold nanoclusters have been widely reported, the synthesis
of silver/gold nanoclusters by nucleoside-templated synthesis is more
challenging because DNA can be designed to place some metal ions in
affinity before reduction.28−31

On the other hand, nucleosides are the basic
units of DNA. Different
nucleosides also play different roles in biological activities. Therefore,
the development of a simple and inexpensive nucleoside identification
method has been the focus of attention of researchers. In this paper,
a simple and rapid preparation method of water-soluble Ag nanoparticles
and Au nanoparticles was developed by using nucleosides as templates.
Then, nucleosides can be distinguished by fluorescence spectra of
silver nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles synthesized from different
nucleosides combined with other chemical analysis methods. This brief
protocol is schematically described in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Schematic of Aqueous Synthesis of Nucleoside-Templated
Fluorescent
Ag NPs and Au NPs
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Reagents
and Chemicals
Adenine (A),
cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) were purchased from Biotopped.
Ascorbic acid and citric acid were bought from Sheng’ao Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Auric chloride acid (HAuCl4) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were obtained from
Kaima Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). All chemicals were used
as received without further purification. Milli-Q water was used throughout.

2.2 Apparatus
All fluorescence (FL) spectra
were recorded on a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL-2100F
transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded in a wavelength range of
4000–500 cm–1 with a Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR
spectrophotometer.

2.3 Synthesis of Nucleoside-Templated
Fluorescent
Ag NPs and Au NPs
Silver nitrate solution (final concentration:
5 mM) was mixed with various nucleoside solution (final concentration:
10 mM), followed by citrate buffer (final concentration: 40 mM, pH
7). Then, an ascorbic acid solution (final concentration: 5 mM) was
added into the resulting solution. After that, the mixture was heated
under 80 °C water bath for 3 h to form fluorescent Ag NPs solution.
The preparation method of Au NPs was similar to that of Ag NPs. The
concentration of various nucleotide was different (final concentration:
5 mM), and the Au NPs reacted in a water bath at 90 °C for 4
h.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Optimization
of Synthetic Condition of Ag
NPs and Au NPs
Some controlled contrast experiments were
carried out to explore the influencing factors in the process of synthesizing
Ag NPs and Au NPs. AgNO3/nucleoside and HAuCl4/nucleoside molar ratio (AgNO3/nucleoside = 1:1, 1:2,
2:1, 1:3 mol/mol; HAuCl4/nucleoside = 1:1, 1:2, 2:1 mol/mol)
were researched, and the corresponding fluorescence spectra were shown
in Figure 1a–h,
it seemed that the optimal AgNO3/nucleoside molar ratio
was 1:2 and the HAuCl4/nucleoside molar ratio was 1:1. Figure 2a–h showed
that the nucleoside-templated fluorescent Ag NPs and Au NPs achieved
the maximum fluorescence intensity under a heating condition for 3
and 4 h, respectively. Ag NPs and Au NPs were formed after heating
the reaction in a water bath for a certain time. In Figure 3a–h, the optimum water
bath temperatures of Ag NPs and Au NPs were 80 and 90 °C, respectively.
The pH values of citrate buffer also play an important role in the
synthesis of nucleoside-templated fluorescent Ag NPs and Au NPs (Figure 4a–h). The
four bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T)
are the basic units of four deoxyribonucleic acids that make up DNA
molecules. DNA, known as deoxyribonucleic acid, is the main component
of chromosomes and also the main genetic material. In the normal state
of human body, the pH value should be maintained between 7.3 and 7.4,
which is slightly alkaline. In this study, the pH of the reaction
environment is 7, which is close to the human body’s required
pH, that is, the appropriate pH of deoxyribonucleic acid. When the
pH value of citrate buffer is 7, the relevant fluorescence reached
maximum. The results show that citrate buffer can also be used as
a reductant, but its reducibility is only effective in the presence
of ascorbic acid

3.2 Characterization
of Nucleoside-Templated Fluorescent
Ag NPs and Au NPs
The fluorescence characteristics of Ag
NPs and Au NPs in the presence or absence of four different nucleosides,
that is, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T), are
shown in Figure 5.
It is easy to observe that when A, C, G, and T are used as templates,
the fluorescence intensity of synthesized Ag NPs is G > C >
A > T,
respectively. High fluorescence Ag NPs are formed due to specific
C–Ag+ interaction. When the pH of the reaction environment
is 7, N3 in cytosine is easy to bind to Ag+ (Figure S1), while N1 and N3 in guanine are easier to bind to Ag+ (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Therefore, the fluorescence
of G-Ag NPs was slightly higher than that of C-Ag NPs. When A, C,
G, and T are not used as templates, the synthesized Ag NPs have no
fluorescence properties (Figure 5a). Similarly, the fluorescence intensity of Au NPs
is G > T > C > A. When the pH of the reaction environment
is 7, the
binding of N1, N3, and carbonyl groups in guanine
with Au3+ is very easy (Figure S1, Supporting Information),
while that of N3 and carbonyl groups in thymine with Au3+ is easy (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Therefore,
the fluorescence of G-Au NPs was slightly higher than that of T-Au
NPs. Without A, C, G, and T as templates, the prepared Au NPs also
have no fluorescence properties (Figure 5b). The fluorescence spectrum of the A-templated
Ag NPs (A-Ag NPs) displayed an emission and excitation maximum wavelengths
at 439 and 360 nm, respectively. The C-templated Ag NPs (C-Ag NPs)
and T-templated Ag NPs (T-Ag NPs) possessed fluorescence maxima at
365/443 nm (Ex/Em) and 365/443 nm (Ex/Em), respectively. The G-templated
Ag NPs (G-Ag NPs) displayed an emission and excitation maximum wavelengths
at 441 and 363 nm, respectively. In addition, the A-templated Au NPs
(A-Au NPs) and C-templated Au NPs (C-Au NPs) possessed fluorescence
maxima at 350/435 nm (Ex/Em) and 366/444 nm (Ex/Em), respectively.
The G-templated Au NPs (G-Au NPs) and T-templated Au NPs (T-Au NPs)
possessed fluorescence maxima at 368/440 nm (Ex/Em) and 365/438 nm
(Ex/Em), respectively.

Figure 5 Fluorescence emission spectra of the (a) Ag NPsand (b)Au
NPs synthesized
with and without nucleoside. Reaction conditions: CAg+ = 5 mM, CAu3+ = 5 mM, Cnucleoside = 10 mM and 5 mM, Cascorbic acid = 5 mM, Ccitrate buffer = 40 mM, pH 7.0, T = 80 and 90 °C, t = 3 and 4 h.

The four nucleoside-templated Ag NPs and Au NPs were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM),
and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was clearly
noticed from HRTEM and TEM images that the Ag NPs and Au NPs were
quasi-spherical (Figure 6 and Figures S2 and S3, Supporting Information),
the sizes of A-Ag NPs, C-Ag NPs, G-Ag NPs, and T-Ag NPs were respectively
estimated to be 25 ± 0.7 nm, 22 ± 0.3 nm, 15 ± 0.4
nm, and 40 ± 0.5 nm. Moreover, G-Ag NPs and T-Ag NPs have very
clear lattice spacings of 0.2322 and 0.2447 nm, respectively (Figure
S2e–h and Figure 6c,d). The sizes of A-Au NPs, C-Au NPs, G-Au NPs, and T-Au NPs were
respectively estimated to be 40 ± 0.6 nm, 13 ± 0.5 nm, 50
± 0.3 nm, and 30 ± 0.4 nm. In addition, C-Au NPs have a
clear lattice spacing of 0.2584 nm (Figure S3e–h and Figure 6f). The
FTIR study of nucleoside-templated Ag NPs and Au NPs shows the presence
of citrate. The characteristic peaks, that is, at around 1394 and
1591 cm–1 for the symmetric stretching and antisymmetric
stretching of COO–, respectively, are clearly seen
in the FTIR spectrum of pure trisodium citrate. Nevertheless, these
characteristic peaks have a red-shift to 1395 and 1602 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of nucleoside-templated Ag NPs and Au NPs.
In addition, it seems to be a strong broad peak band, covering a wide
range of about 3000–3700 cm–1, which may
correspond to O–H stretching (Figure 7a–h). All these FTIR results indicate
that nucleoside-templated Ag NPs and Au NPs may contain COO– and O–H functional groups. In addition, the fluorescence
stability of Ag NPs and Au NPs templated by nucleosides was also discussed.
From Figure 8, we can
clearly see that the fluorescence intensity of nucleoside-templated
Ag NPs changed very slightly in 60 days, while that of nucleoside-templated
Au NPs changed slightly in 35 days. In addition, we also discussed
the fluorescence stability of Ag NPs and Au NPs in different buffer
solutions. The results show that the fluorescence properties of Ag
NPs and Au NPs in PBS (pH = 7.0) and tris-HCl (pH = 7.0) buffer solutions
are inferior to those in citrate buffer solutions as shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). This is because
citrate buffer is not only used as a buffer solution but also as a
reductant. PBS and tris-HCl buffer solutions are only used as buffer
solutions. In addition, the effects of metal ions (including Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, K+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, Ni2+, Sn2+, etc.) on the fluorescence stability of
Ag NPs and Au NPs were also discussed. As shown in Figures S5, S6, and S7 (Supporting Information), the fluorescence
properties of Ag NPs and Au NPs were obviously weakened when metal
ions are added. This is because metal ions destroy the structure of
Ag NPs and Au NPs protected by nucleosides, thus weakening their fluorescence
properties.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully
synthesized nucleoside-templated
fluorescent Ag NPs and Au NPs in the presence of ascorbic acid and
citrate buffer. In addition, the effects of the molar ratio of reactants,
reaction time, reaction temperature, pH of citrate buffer solution,
and nucleotides on the synthesis of Ag NPs and Au NPs were also discussed.
The TEM, fluorescence, and FTIR characterizations validate that nucleoside-templated
Ag NPs and Au NPs, indicating that their morphology is similar to
spherical, have good fluorescence stability and easy water solubility.
The combination of fluorescent nanoparticles and molecular species
can enable us to attempt to use a variety of technologies to understand
medical biological processes more comprehensively. It has potential
and promising applications in related biological analysis and biomedical
diagnosis.
