Introduction
The interactions between carbohydrate
molecules and protein receptors
are essential for diverse processes of biological and biomedical importance.1 Undeniably, the sugar molecules that decorate
lipids or proteins, forming glycolipid and glycoproteins, play key
roles as contact points for a multitude of molecular recognition events
that steer specific biological phenomena (Figure 1).2 In this context,
the malfunction of either partner, the glycan (ligand) or the protein
(receptor), may lead to detrimental outcomes for health. For instance,
it is rather frequent that tumor cells display altered glycosylation
patterns in the initial periods of tumor growth.3 In fact, several glycans have been directly associated
with various cancer types. From the receptor’s perspective,
the partners, glycan-binding proteins (lectins), may also be modified
under different disease conditions with respect to their “correct”
structures or cellular concentrations.4

summary of the typical protein–carbohydrate recognition
events that mediate the cell–cell and host–pathogen
interactions and relationship.

Therefore, revealing the fine details of glycan–protein
interactions (Figure 2) should permit advancing in the scientific understanding, at the
highest possible resolution, of different biological events linked
to health and disease. It is nowadays accepted that many factors influence
glycan recognition events, including multivalency5 and presentation of epitopes.6 Obviously, kinetics effects are also important, as well as the interplay
between enthalpy (van der Waals, CH−π,7 electrostatic, water–ligand, and water–receptor
interactions) and entropy factors (rigidification, desolvation–solvation,
and hydrophobic effects).8

Figure 2 Typical intermolecular
interactions involved in protein–ligand
recognition events.

There are different techniques
that can be employed to unravel
the structural features of protein–carbohydrate interactions
(Figure 3). Very frequently,
the experimental data acquired by structural techniques (cryo-electron
microscopy,9 X-ray crystallography,10 and/or NMR spectroscopy)11 are complemented with additional information generated
by complementary biophysical techniques (SPR,12 ITC,13 BLI,14 etc.). The assistance of molecular modeling procedures is also fairly
frequent to provide a full picture of the structure and dynamics of
the glycan/lectin complex under investigation. Although cryo-electron
microscopy methods have started to be employed to characterize glycan-binding
events,15 the high level of structural
details afforded by employing X-ray crystallography makes this technique
the reference for studying these complexes,16 despite the drawbacks that have been identified by experts regarding
the refinement protocols of the electron density of the glycans to
get their correct structures.17

Figure 3 Different approaches
to provide insights into the interaction between
carbohydrates and receptors.

NMR has also been extensively used to study the conformation of
glycans for several decades.18 However,
novel methodologies and protocols have recently permitted discovering
new concepts associated with structural features that may permit extraordinary
advances in the understanding of how the three-dimensional (3D) structure
of glycans is regulated and how the presentation of the key epitope
is achieved.

Generally speaking, NMR-based strategies usually
include nuclear
Overhauser effect (NOE)- and rotating-frame Overhauser effect (ROE)-derived
distance constraints19 and/or measurements
in the presence of paramagnetic tags (pseudo-contact shifts, PCS,
and paramagnetic enhanced relaxation, PRE), as will be described in
a specific section, to provide structural details about the sugar
arrangement and/or flexibility of the glycan-containing biomolecules.
Besides, standard relaxation parameters, diffusion ordered spectroscopy
(DOSY)20 and/or J couplings can offer useful
information about local flexibility around the glycosidic linkages21 and the ring conformer distribution22 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Common NMR methodologies used for studying dynamics and conformation
of complex oligosaccharides.

A typical limitation in oligosaccharide conformational studies
is the poor NOE enhancement factor for small- and medium-sized oligosaccharides,
which generates close-to-zero NOEs. However, such a drawback can be
overcome by different alternatives: decreasing the temperature below
10 °C, using very large magnetic fields or conducting ROE-based
experiments. An alternative strategy is to covalently attach the glycan
to a protein, thus drastically reducing the molecular tumbling of
the saccharide and favoring the detection of strongly negative NOE
effects. This approach has been masterly employed to assess the conformation
of LeX-type antigens.23

Alternatively, in this perspective article, we will focus on the
latest advances in NMR spectroscopy that permit spectacular advances
in the analysis of glycan–receptor interactions. The enormous
variety of NMR methods and protocols make this spectroscopy highly
suitable to explore the conformation, dynamics, and interactions of
glycans. Since a recent survey on the status of the field was presented
in 2018 to the scientific community,24 we
will specially focus herein on our perspective of the latest advances
and how we feel that they will provide a revolution in the field.

Glycoproteins
and Protein–Sugar Interactions
One of the frontiers
of NMR in this field is in the study of intact
glycoproteins.25 These molecules are intrinsically
heterogeneous, and the glycan chains provide them with an additional
level of chemical complexity, which may, in turn, be also linked to
its biological function.26 Nevertheless,
in the past few years, NMR has emerged as a very powerful tool to
work with complex glycosylated proteins, providing detailed information
on the structure and dynamics of glycans attached to proteins, and
enabling the study of recognition events involving such glycoproteins.27 The observation of these events from the protein
point of view normally requires uniform isotopic labeling to carry
out a consistent NMR-based analysis. However, the major drawback associated
with this NMR-based study arises from the slow protein tumbling motion,
which precludes, in many cases, that the glycosylation pattern provides
an extra layer of solvation, and the effective size of the molecule
becomes tremendously high.28 Thus, the
acquisition of 3D experiments with multiple coherence transfer steps
turns out to be complicated due to faster relaxation processes. A
promising solution to decrease relaxation is complete protein deuteration
by growing cells in D2O, usually employing insect cells.29 Glycan truncation could be another option to
reduce fast relaxation in solution (Figures 5 and 6), as long as
the suppressed branches or sugar units do not significantly affect
the protein stability or biological properties.30 A more radical option would be directly mutating the asparagine
residues attached to the glycans, although these chemical changes
will surely affect the structural stability, interaction ability,
and the biological function.31

of a glycoprotein using different glycosidases
and its effect on the 1H/13C-heteronuclear single
quantum coherence (HSQC) resonances observed in the anomeric region
(4.5–5.5 ppm) showing the sugars attached to the protein. Each
removed sugar unit will entail the disappearance of one peak, corresponding
to its C1 position.

Figure 6 Effect of glycosylation
in the 1H–15N backbone resonances of
proteins observed by two-dimensional (2D)
heteronuclear NMR.

Nevertheless, some of
these strategies have been employed to study
glycoproteins by NMR, suppressing the entire glycan ramifications
that are not or barely important for structural integrity and activity.32 Alternative studies on large glycan-containing
proteins have made use of specific amino acid labeling strategies
to simplify the 2D-HSQC spectra and to cope with line-broadening issues.
These methodologies include [13C]-labeling of methyl groups
of methionines and/or the aliphatic amino acids (Ile, Leu, and Val),
as well as labeling of the carbonyl groups.33

Alternatively, sugar labeling has also been used to exclusively
extract information from the external N-glycans. This method has been
efficiently used to observe the first sugar residue directly attached
to the asparagine side chain, which displays a particular carbon resonance
around δ 80 ppm, derived from its linkage to a nitrogen atom.34 Another approach would be the so-called postpurification
labeling, consisting in ordinarily expressing the unlabeled glycoprotein
and then using [13C]-labeled sugar nucleotides with specific
glycosyltransferases to attach them to the terminal positions of glycan
branches.35

Chemical shifts provide
key information on perturbations arising
from particular chemical environments, and this parameter is used
as a tool to detect flexibility changes in glycoproteins. This approach
has been employed to study the interaction of Skp1 from the ameba Dictyostelium (DdSkp1) with its F-box counterpart protein,36 which are involved in protein polyubiquitination
processes. This protein is unusually hydroxylated at Pro143 and subsequently
glycosylated with a pentameric glycan chain. Isotopic enrichment of
the Skp1 fragments with 2H, 15N, and 13C enabled the collection of the corresponding 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13CO backbone chemical shifts for further conformational analysis.
As expected, the mono- and polyglycosylated forms of Skp1 (Gn-DdSkp1
and GGFGGn-DdSkp1, respectively) displayed noticeable chemical shift
perturbations (CSP) around residues 139–153 upon glycosylation.
The analysis of the chemical shift index (CSI) for the unmodified
DdSkp1 strongly predicted a random coil conformation in the C-termini.
However, the same CSI values were consistent with the presence of
a short α-helix region for the glycosylated Gn-DdSkp1, thus
demonstrating that this conformational change actually takes place
and specifically affects the C-terminal segment of DdSkp1. 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra confirmed
this finding by providing the typical sequential 1HN–1HN NOE cross-peaks for an α-helix,
whereas the random coil index values from 15N{1H} NOE data supported a reduction in the degree of structural disorder
upon glycosylation, although the global mobility of this segment is
still high, as assessed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. From
these conclusions, this glycan-mediated structural rearrangement has
been proposed to enhance the association with the F-box counterpart
by defining a distribution of preferential conformational states.

Apart from the effect of the attached sugars on the glycoprotein
conformations, the influence of the natural, external glycan substrates
upon binding can also lead to notorious changes in the 3D structure
of the protein counterpart, as exemplified by the human blood group
A and B glycosyltransferases (GTA and GTB).38 Both enzymes experience transitions between “open”,
“semi-closed”, and “closed” conformations
when interacting with the corresponding substrates, the histo-blood
group H (HBG-H) and the sugar donor (UDP-Gal/GalNAc). For this particular
system, “hot-spot labeling” enabled conformational studies
through the observation of the HN side chain from 15N-Trp
and the ε-methyl of 13C-Met. Monitoring of CSP through 1H–15N-HSQC–TROSY and 1H–13C-HSQC–TROSY provided key information
on GTA and GTB dynamics during binding events. HSQC-based titrations
revealed different exchange kinetics depending on the presence of
one substrate or both at the same time. The progressive addition of
UDP led to continuous CSP on the HN side chain signals of Trp residues,
indicative of a fast exchange binding process. Fittingly, some methionine
methyl groups showed fast and intermediate exchange. These near-to-coalescence
trajectories allowed calculating exchange rates, with kex values of up to 70 Hz (fast–intermediate regime).
Interestingly, the subsequent addition of HBG-H to the UDP-saturated
enzyme revealed a slow exchange process in the NMR chemical shift
time scale, as supported by the estimated exchange rates and the presence
of two different peaks for some methionine residues. Consistently,
these results highlight the allosteric regulation of HBG-H binding
mediated by the prior interaction with the sugar donor, and how this
allosteric control affects enzyme dynamics. In fact, a mutual allosteric
regulation is observed since first titrating both enzymes with HBG-H
and then with UDP actually guide to the same results. The large CSP
detected for some remote methionines provided further evidence on
local conformational rearrangements in regions far away from the binding
site, as a potential consequence of transitions from the open to the
“close” states. How these local movements contribute
to switch between conformational states remains unclear yet, and can
be exemplified, for instance, by the differences in protein motions
reported for some mutants, which suggest the existence of more intermediate
conformers.

Amazingly, Schubert et al. have shown how recognition
of glycosylation
patterns can be achieved by simple NMR experiments.37 By means of 2D correlation NMR spectra acquired at natural
isotopic abundance, they have been able to distinguish among differentiated
patterns of glycosylation present in glycoproteins from different
organisms (bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals). This analysis relies
on the fingerprint patterns characteristic of each monosaccharide
and linkage type: in the [1H, 13C]-HSQC 2D NMR
experiment, the N-linked glycans can be easily differentiated from
the O-linked ones. The remaining components of the saccharidic skeleton
can be deduced from a thorough examination of the visible spin systems
through the set of 2D experiments. Then, the monosaccharide fragments
can be reasonably linked step by step, inferring the entire glycan
structure. In this procedure, no labeled protein samples are needed
and the experiments are independent of the macromolecule size. However,
high concentrations of the protein are required. With lower protein
concentrations, assignment of oligosaccharides could be still accomplished
but would necessarily require [13C]-labeling as well as
sequential assignments via 3D NMR spectra.

As mentioned above,
the enormous compositional heterogeneity of
sugars in glycoproteins is a notorious disadvantage for NMR assignment,
which becomes an arduous work when the structure of the oligosaccharide
is unknown. To identify saccharides making use of the available NMR
data, several databases and computer algorithms have been developed
over time. GlycoNMRSearch is a new promising bioinformatics tool39 that could boost the applicability of NMR for
complex glycan identification and assignment. This search algorithm
novelty combines experimental chemical shift values with a new library
of assigned spin systems, not contained in other databases. It is
designed to efficiently find correlations between any chemical shift
in a given spin system and all described spin systems deposited in
the NMR database.

The increasing amount of deposited NMR data
regarding oligosaccharides
has also eased the observation of novel spatial arrangements that
glycans with certain scaffolds tend to adopt, highlighting the importance
of developing tools for studying complex, unaltered structures instead
of individual fragments. A particular case has recently gained increasing
interest. The LeX-type branched oligosaccharides display
an intramolecular C–H···O hydrogen bond, associated
with the stacking of two nonvicinal sugar residues.40 The detection of this nonconventional hydrogen bond has
raised the question on its actual importance for the conformational
stabilization of the particular 3D geometry and whether this particular
C–H···O interaction could have any relevant
biological role, not only in glycans but also in proteins and nucleic
acids.41 A detailed inspection of the oligosaccharides
that show this feature has revealed that all of them share a common
set of structural features: the interacting fucose (Fuc) residue and
its stacked residue are both bound to a third central one through
α(1–3) and β(1–4) glycosidic linkages, respectively,
or through the α(1–4) and β(1–3) alternatives
(Figure 7). The central
residue is always Glc or GlcNAc, whereas the residue involved in the
interaction with the Fuc unit may be Gal, GalNAc, Glc, or GlcNAc.
Consequently, this unusual hydrogen bond does not appear in other
histo-blood groups (HBG) such as HBG-A or HBG-B, for which the Fuc
unit is α(1–2)-linked to the core residue.42

Figure 7 (A) Nine categories of glycan motifs that share the same
kind of
stabilizing hydrogen bond C–H···O between the
H5-Fuc and the stacking residue. The percentage corresponds to the
amount of glycan structures in the Glycosciences.de database which
contain each trisaccharide. (B) The generic structure of the fucose-containing
trisaccharide that possesses the mentioned inter-residue hydrogen
bond and the possible substitutions that have been reported in the

Use
of Paramagnetic NMR
This methodology, which is transferred
from the protein field,
has provoked a revolution in the glycan conformational analysis in
the past few years.43 Indeed, the use of
oligosaccharides decorated with lanthanide-binding tags has arisen
as new NMR protocols to unravel the 3D shape of complex glycans and
to afford key elements for unraveling fine details of their interactions.44 From the physics perspective, the origin of
this methodology is perfectly established. The occurrence of a paramagnetic
nucleus in a molecule generates strong chemical shift variations,
pseudo-contact shifts45 (PCS), in the NMR
resonance signals of its adjacent nuclei. These PCS depend on the
distance with the inverse of the third power of the distance; therefore,
they decrease more slowly with the distance than the NOEs and paramagnetic
relaxation enhancements (PRE). Thus, these PCS can be employed to
deduce distance constraints in a quantitative manner (Figure 4).

Using this methodology,
insights into the conformational details
of simple oligosaccharides46 and, in particular,
bi-antennary47 and tetra-antennary complex
type48 and high mannose N-glycans have
been deduced.49 The different NMR-active
nuclei in these molecules show isochronous chemical shifts for the
units located at the end of the arms, and therefore, their complete
NMR analysis is highly difficult or almost impossible.50 Nevertheless, the initial employment of this
approach has also allowed the direct evaluation of the interaction
of saccharides (lactose-type), decorated with the lanthanide-binding
tag, with a lectin (human galectin-3).51 More recently, the experimental conformational analysis of extremely
complex bi- and tetra-antennary oligosaccharides has also been achieved,
since the use of the paramagnetic approach permits distinguishing
all specific NMR signals of these molecules, thus removing the intrinsic
2-fold or 4-fold pseudosymmetry of the glycans. In this manner, their
interactions with different lectins have also been studied. This approach
represents a key breakthrough in the field, beyond current expertise.52 Obviously, using regular NMR experiments, the 1H and 13C nuclei belonging to the four terminal
Gal residues at the tetra-antennary N-glycan display chemical shift
degeneracy and are indistinguishable. As a major recent innovation
in the field, the analysis of the conformation, dynamics, and molecular
recognition properties of a long sialylated tetradecasaccharide bi-antennary
N-glycan with two LacNAc repetitions at each arm has been effectively
achieved. In fact, this complex N-glycan is the receptor of the hemagglutinin
of several pathogenic influenza viruses.53 Using the paramagnetic approach, the 1H and 13C signals of each sugar unit in the glycan were identified and the
combined use of PCS and STD data allowed deducing the binding epitope
of the N-glycan toward Hong-Kong HK/68 hemagglutinin.54

For molecular recognition studies, there is one alternative
strategy,
which involves the use of either a spin label or a paramagnetic ion,
but now placed at the receptor. In this case, a metal locus for attaching
the paramagnetic ion to the protein should be designed, which involves
a precise design. As examples, short lanthanide-binding peptides have
been synthesized using a fusion construct for protein expression.55 This approach may also permit obtaining complementary
NMR parameters, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) without
employing external alignment media. RDC and PCS data have been employed
to build the three-dimensional model of a lectin/lactose complex using
this methodology. The use of a similar strategy, inserting a lanthanide-binding
peptide into the loop between two helixes of a known IgG binding protein,
has allowed the characterization of the dynamic properties of Fc glycans.56

Moreover, paramagnetic relaxation enhancements
(PRE) constitute
another source of detailed structural information, extensively used
in NMR to gain insights into conformational features of highly complex
oligosaccharides and for analyzing protein–carbohydrate interactions
as well. They are particularly useful as they provide long-range structural
information. In this regard, the radical marker TEMPO is one of the
frequent choices to undertake these kinds of studies. A recent work
by Moure et al. exemplifies the rational use of TEMPO to unveil the
structural details underlying the interaction between the human Roundabout
1 (Robo1) protein and heparan sulfate.57 In particular, for the introduction of TEMPO into the protein, the
authors employed enzyme-catalyzed glycosylation reactions. The protein
was expressed in mammalian cells that lack N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase,
preventing extension of the glycans and leaving only the core that
was cleaved to a single GlcNAc residue. Thus, a monosaccharide with
an azide group was coupled to this GlcNAc moiety and afterward, the
paramagnetic tag was attached by a Cu-mediated “click”
reaction. The presence of TEMPO caused PRE effects, giving rise to
a complete loss of the NMR cross-peak intensities in the 1H–15N-HSQC for those nuclei closer than 10 Å
and a decrease for those at distances up to 24 Å, depending on
their proximity to the TEMPO ring. The combination of these experimental
data with MD simulations allowed describing protein dynamics and examining
the binding of a ligand. In this case, the use of diffusion ordered
spectroscopy58 (DOSY) permitted exclusively
obtaining the NMR spectra of the bound ligand, whose analysis allowed
inferring the exact position and orientation of the ligand in the
binding site.

Use of Stable Isotopes: 13C- and 19F-Labeled
Oligosaccharides
Advances in synthesis and molecular biology
methods now permit
accessing extremely complex oligosaccharides, which were almost impossible
to access a few years ago for detailed structural, conformational,
and interaction studies.59 The use of these
methodologies permits the generation of extremely valuable saccharide
samples that contain one or several residues labeled with stable NMR-active
isotopes (13C, 15N).60 Clearly, 13C-labeling offers significant advantages for
oligosaccharide NMR analyses: The large spectral dispersion of this
nucleus and the option of combining this information with that of 1H through 2D or 3D NMR experiments allow solving the usual
signal overlapping in glycan NMR spectroscopy61 (Figure 8). However,
an important concern when using 13C-labeled carbohydrates
is the suppression of the large 13C–13C couplings. Over the past few years, the application of constant-time
periods (CT) in the indirect dimension or the use of virtual decoupling
schemes have been proved to be very useful to avoid the 13C–13C coupling problem.62

Figure 8 Scheme

carbohydrates for NMR studies. (A) 2D-1H–13C-HSQC experiments to study interactions and recognition
events involving carbohydrates. (B) Selective labeling strategies
to reduce overlapping and signal crowding of NMR spectra in long and
complex oligosaccharides. (C) 13C-labeling applied to study
conformations through the analysis of 1H–13C coupling constants.

The presence of a labeled
molecule opens the possibility of using 13C- and/or 15N-filtered NOESY experiments, which
are ideally suited to extract intermolecular interactions.63 NMR approaches that use 13C/15N-labeled proteins in conjunction with 13C-labeled
carbohydrates have been efficiently applied by Nestor et al. to describe
the interaction between the 13C-labeled Manα(1–2)Manα(1–2)ManαOMe
(Man3) trisaccharide core and cyanovirin-N (CV-N) P51G.64 This protein displays binding sites, A and B,
which preferentially bind to the Man3 trisaccharide and
Man2 disaccharide, respectively.65 Due to the known slow-exchange regime in which this interaction
takes place, STD-NMR experiments66 cannot
be used for directly monitoring the ligand signals. Instead, the use
of 1H–13C-CT–HSQC spectra, complemented
with 1H–13C-HSQC–NOESY data, allowed
assessing the CV-N bound conformation of Man3, which was
very similar to that in the free state. Noteworthily, the authors
efficiently exploited the 1H–13C and 15N–13C heteronuclear correlations to accurately
describe the protein–ligand close contacts in the complex of 13C-Man3 with the 15N-labeled protein.
Fittingly, all of these results led to a description of the binding
pose that appropriately correlated with the X-ray structure (PDB: 3GXZ).67

In a parallel work, the 13C-labeled Man3 trisaccharide
has been shown to display well-resolved NMR signals for its polar
hydroxyl protons even at room temperature.68 The presence of these signals encouraged the characterization of
additional recognition features not feasible with regular unlabeled
carbohydrates. The assignment of the hydroxyl groups was performed
with simple 1H,13C-HSQC–TOCSY
experiments that also allowed estimating the different 3JCHOH values, and thus deducing the major H–C–O–H
rotamer for each hydroxyl group. Nevertheless, the most remarkable
output of this work is the very detailed description of the hydrogen
bond network present in the complex, an unprecedented result if considering
that these protons are usually inaccessible by NMR due to the typical
proton-water exchange that affects the polar 1H nuclei.69

Although 13C-labeled saccharides
have been proved to
be highly advantageous for NMR studies on carbohydrates, their synthesis
is still troublesome.70 Hence, there are
multiple lines of work that keep focusing on improving the synthetic
routes to afford these biomolecules. An interesting synthetic strategy
is the automated glycan assembly scheme,71 which has been recently used to readily synthesize several well-defined
oligosaccharides, containing selectively 13C-labeled residues.72 This selective labeling enables breaking the
chemical shift degeneracy, making possible the precise NMR analysis
of each residue. One advantage of the chemical shift degeneracy is
that the 1JCH values for each
residue are accessible. Since it is widely known that the 1JCH values provide information on the
preferred axial or equatorial orientation of the anomeric hydrogen,73 the observed 1JCH values for the different β-pyranose rings served to
deduce the percentage of the 4C1 chair and the
alternative 1C4 chair conformations in each
case. For some of the synthesized structures, differences in the 4C1–1C4 ratio were
found between internal and external sugar residues, which nicely concurred
with the results obtained from MD simulations.

Besides 13C-labeling, carbohydrates are often labeled
with fluorine nuclei. The advantages of using this probe in 19F NMR studies are enormous: the active isotope is highly abundant
in nature and its intrinsic sensitivity is almost as good as that
of the 1H nucleus. Moreover, the spectral dispersion of 19F NMR signals is remarkably larger than that of the protons.
Usually, only one or a few 19F atoms are chemically introduced
in the studied molecule, thus increasing the simplicity of the recorded
spectra and facilitating their interpretation.74

Broadening effects in ligand signals upon binding
may be successfully
used to describe protein–ligand interactions.75 For this purpose, T2-filtered NMR relaxation
experiments constitute a robust method to characterize such recognition
events, and fluorinated probes provided the simplest way to observe
linewidth changes regarding the aforementioned advantages.7619F-NMR-based experiments have been
employed for screening a library of analogues of 2-deoxy-2-trifluoroacetamido-α-mannoside
to the C-type lectin, Langerin, to target the additional pockets on
the Langerin surface, close to the calcium-binding site.77 These analogues are decorated with different
molecular fragments on the acetyl branch, substituting the −CF3 group of the reference compound. Indeed, the −CF3 group of the reporter molecule showed substantial line broadening,
evidencing binding to the protein, and the interaction was quantified
by competition experiments. In particular, the observed relaxation
rates R2,obs were measured for the probe
in the presence of increasing amounts of glycomimetics (Figure 9). The recovery of the trifluoroacetamide
peak afforded the corresponding dissociation constants for the library.

affinities of a library of compounds using a monofluorinated probe.
The signal recovery after displacing the probe from the binding site
can be correlated with differences in binding constants.

Toward in-Cell NMR: Recognizing Carbohydrates in Crowded Environments
The last frontier in glycan recognition by NMR is to explore these
interactions in cells. As a general rule, most of the NMR studies
oriented to get insights into molecular recognition processes are
performed in vitro. Those conditions usually include the sole presence
of the macromolecule of interest under diluted conditions and a few
ligands, as well as other buffer components, commonly salts and/or
small organic compounds. In contrast, the biological milieu is far
from these experimental conditions: a complex and crowded environment
in which several additional factors can simultaneously affect the
nature of protein–ligand interactions in different ways as
they are detected under in vitro conditions.78 Thus, the challenge is to employ NMR methods in cells, but still
there are many examples of these applications, which have been specially
focused on the study of the interaction of the histo-blood group antigens
with virus-like particles, as a previous step to monitor their recognition
by specific capsid viral proteins.79

Molecular crowding primarily affects the viscosity, which consequently
disturbs the diffusion-related processes and causes an important reduction
in the available volume, enhancing steric repulsion phenomena.80 Whereas repulsions tend to favor protein stability
by self- and non-self-assembly, the existence of nonspecific protein–protein
soft interactions, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, contributes to
misfolding and aggregation. In cellular environments, protein interactions
at this level of complexity have already been shown to be crucial
for establishing signaling cascades and organizing multi-enzyme complexes
through the electrostatic interaction of specific residues at protein
surfaces.81 Therefore, an expanded understanding
of recognition processes in crowded media requires considering these
so-called “quinary interactions”.81 Part of the most recent studies related to this issue have
been primarily focused on antibodies,82 since such therapeutic biomolecules function in the blood stream,
a very heterogeneous environment.83 In
this context, NMR may be used as a tool to elucidate the structural
details that play a key role in molecular recognition events in solution
involving glycans. Obviously, all of these studies imply using isotopic
labeling as a strategy to distinguish the system of interest in the
heterogeneous media.

Along this line, the receptor–ligand
interactions between
human galectin-3 and β-galactoside-containing glycans have been
studied in a crowded milieu.84 This work
exemplifies the effects of the viscosity and steric repulsion combined
with additional specific interactions ascribed to other glycoproteins
present in the heterogeneous environment. Line broadening was observed
in the 1H–15N-HSQC spectrum when 15N-Gal-3 was titrated with increasing amounts of four different
crowding agents: bovine serum albumin (BSA-I), human serum albumin
(HSA-I), Ficoll, and PEG 3350. The decrease in signal intensities
is strongly correlated with the increment in solution viscosity. However,
the addition of both polymers, Ficoll and PEG 3350, increased the
viscosity much more than in the case of both albumins. The intense
signal broadening observed in the presence of HSA and BSA could be,
therefore, ascribed to the formation of large-sized Gal-3/crowder
complexes through additional specific and nonspecific interactions.
Instead, Ficoll and PEG 3350 seemed to be more inert although still
evoked line-broadening effects in the Gal-3 1H–15N-HSQC. Since HSA and BSA samples contained other serum glycoproteins
and Gal-3 recognizes the β-Gal epitope, it would be reasonable
to think about an actual specific recognition process between both
proteins. Indeed, the subsequent addition of saturating amounts of
lactose to the BSA-I/Gal-3 and HSA-I/Gal-3 samples allowed disrupting
the suggested interactions, which led to a partial recovery of Gal-3
signal intensities. The lactose did not significantly affect the viscosity
of the samples, and the same experiments with Ficoll and PEG 3350
showed no changes in the HSQC spectra, thus confirming the specificity
of this recognition event. Similarly, the 1H–15N-HSQC in the presence of the non-glycosylated serum albumin
HSA-II displayed negligible line-broadening effects, exclusively due
to viscosity issues. The addition of lactose also gave rise to the
corresponding chemical shift perturbations that were identical to
those measured on diluted Gal-3/lactose samples.85 This observation underlines the ability of the lactose
to find the proper binding site even in physiological crowded media,
even though the Kd would reasonably be
lower due to slower diffusion processes (reduced kon) and competition with other substrates for the Gal-3
binding site. Finally, the interaction of Gal-3 with serum glycoproteins
from both HSA and BSA samples was demonstrated to occur via recognition
of the nonreducing 2,3-sialyllactose motif present in those glycoproteins,
as evidenced by the identical set of CSP obtained for the Gal-3 HSQC
spectrum when titrated with the pure 2,3-sialyllactose trisaccharide.

Glycan
Interactions Monitored by Solid-State NMR
Solid-State NMR,
ssNMR, has emerged in the last decades as a formidable,
realistic, and versatile tool in structural biology.86 Indeed, the ssNMR approach may also be very informative
to observe the behavior of different oligosaccharides in their intact
chemical form and when bound to prokaryotic or eukaryotic receptors.

As one of the first examples in the area, Simorre et al.87 studied the structure and dynamics of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan, an essential component
of the bacterial cell wall, which was obtained in its double labeled
form using 13C, 15N-isotopically labeled E. coli BL21 cells as medium. The important flexibility
of the PG was inferred from the observed reduced dipolar coupling
values. Moreover, its interaction with YajG, a E. coli protein, with a yet unknown role in PG metabolism was later evaluated
through the changes in the relaxation behavior of the partners.88

In a related context, Baldus and co-workers
have investigated the
structure and dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterial cell.89 This is characterized by a molecular complex
that consists of two lipid bilayers, inner and outer membranes, separated
by the peptidoglycan layer. The outer membrane is asymmetrical and
consists of phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoproteins,
and membrane proteins.90 In this particular
case, the PG and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components could be assigned
through 1H–13C and 13C–13C correlation experiments.91

As landmarks in the molecular recognition field, the interaction
between Colicin N, an antibacterial protein toxin secreted by E. coli, with the lipopolysaccharide close to the
membrane surface has also been investigated,92 while the interaction of the intact PG from Bacillus
subtilis with the L,D-transpeptidase LdtBS has also been scrutinized using U-[13C, 15N]-labeled LdtBS and PG molecules.93 A detailed NMR analysis of the behavior of PG in its free
and bound forms was carried out through relaxation and RDC measurements
to deduce the effect of protein binding on PG conformations and dynamics.
Interestingly, PG dynamics was clearly affected, although no drastic
chemical shift perturbations in the PG signals were observed in the
presence of the protein. More recently,94 two different and archetypal LPS have been studied in a membrane-like
environment. In particular, the structures of LPS from different bacterial
strains, a rough-type LPS from E. coliK-12 and a smooth-type LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 strains, were used as
systems. P. aeruginosa PAO1 displays
variable LPS O-antigens, which are composed of the same lipid-A-core
oligosaccharide but decorated with two different O-antigens.95 The A-band O-antigen is based on a D-rhamnose
repeating unit, whereas the B-band shows a complex trisaccharide with
two N-acylated mannuronic acids and one FucNAc moiety. Initial studies
permitted assigning the last four carbons of the lipid chains only
a few resonances of the inner core oligosaccharides.95 However, the analysis of the ssNMR data permitted identifying
the signals of the major B-band O-antigen trisaccharide, allowing
the study of the chemical shift perturbations and the relaxation behavior
in the presence of gentamicin, allowing confirming that a specific
oligosaccharide is indeed involved in the recognition of the antibiotic.96

Obviously, the use of ssNMR for the direct
observation of LPS endotoxins
in their natural environments constitutes an important step in the
field of molecular microbiology with special emphasis on the investigation
of novel antibiotic molecules.

Perspectives
Glycosciences are enjoying
from exciting developments in the field.
Novel NMR methodologies, technologies, and applications are emerging
continuously, advancing our knowledge on glycans, glycan interactions,
and their key roles in health and disease. Indeed, the application
of novel NMR methodologies (paramagnetic, RDC, and RCSA constraints)97 will allow further advances and breakthroughs
in the structural and dynamic analysis of many complex glycans as
well as to disentangle key features of their interactions with receptors.
These methodologies together with the impressive synthetic efforts98 carried out by expert chemists around the world
will allow breaking the limits in accessing information for highly
complex glycan structures and providing a detailed understanding of
the molecular mechanisms behind the concomitant recognition events.
In fact, the application of NMR methodologies is of enormous importance
to uncover the glycan epitope presentation to the receptors, a key
information for vaccine development, drug discovery programs, and
for the invention of novel therapeutics for combating different pathologies,
including infection and immune diseases and cancer.99 The new NMR methodologies described herein together with
the continuous advances in sensitivity provided by the manufacturers
(new probes, hardware, and technologies) will also permit directly
studying intact glycoproteins100 and their
interactions so that, together with chemoenzymatic remodeling tools,
they will have applications for designing novel glycosylated therapeutic
antibodies. Concomitantly, novel glycan biomarkers will be characterized.
In this context, we also expect a tremendous development of the application
of high-field NMR methods in cells, in the true biological environment.
Thus, we envisage a large contribution of NMR methods and applications
to the exciting glycoscience field.
