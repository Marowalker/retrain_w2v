Carbonic
anhydrase (CA) is a family of metalloenzymes that has
the potential to sequestrate carbon dioxide (CO2) from
the environment and reduce pollution. The goal of this study is to
apply protein engineering to develop a modified CA enzyme that has
both higher stability and activity and hence could be used for industrial
purposes. In the current study, we have developed an in silico method
to understand the molecular basis behind the stability of CA. We have
performed comparative molecular dynamics simulation of two homologous
α-CA, one of thermophilic origin (Sulfurihydrogenibium sp.) and its mesophilic counterpart (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), for 100 ns each at 300, 350, 400, and 500 K. Comparing the trajectories
of two proteins using different stability-determining factors, we
have designed a highly thermostable version of mesophilic α-CA
by introducing three mutations (S44R, S139E, and K168R). The designed
mutant α-CA maintains conformational stability at high temperatures.
This study shows the potential to develop industrially stable variants
of enzymes while maintaining high activity.

Introduction
Ever-increasing
concentration of CO2 is a pertinent
threat, whose major contributor is flue gas from coal-fired power
plants. Because of its low cost and high availability, there is a
rapid increase in the usage of coal, especially in power plants. Hence,
there is an urgent demand for developing techniques that would capture
the generated carbon dioxide to prevent its excessive emission to
the atmosphere.1 Current procedures, including
amine absorption, calcium hydroxide absorption, gas separation, and
so forth, are of limited or no success, due to very high energy consumption.2 Amine absorption, which is the most energy-efficient
CO2 capture technology to date, is associated with around
85% “cost of electricity”. This indicates that 85% of
the energy generated by a coal-fired power plant will be consumed
in capturing the CO2 emitted by the same power plant, making
development of novel CO2 capture technology absolutely
essential for the carbon-constraint world in the 21st century. The
ultimate goal of our research is to develop a biological method using
enzymes to capture CO2.3,4

In nature,
bacteria transforms CO2 to bicarbonate at
physiological pH, using the carbonic anhydrase (CA) class of enzymes
as catalysts.5−7 CA is a family of zinc-containing metalloenzymes
that stimulates the interconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into bicarbonate and proton,8−10 and hence,
this enzyme helps in transporting CO2 in the form of water-soluble
bicarbonate.11,12    Therefore,
the above-mentioned enzymatic mechanism
can be used in tackling the pollution problem caused by the emission
of CO2 from industries.13,14 CA is found
ubiquitously in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria), algae, plants
as well as in higher eukaryotic animals. There are five classes of
evolutionary distinct CAs, namely, α, β, γ, δ,
and ζ. All of these classes are found in bacteria,15,16 except for the δ class, which is found in diatoms. These different
classes of CAs share very low sequence identity and have different
structural folds (Figures 1 and S1). Differences in sequence
homology and structure along with identity in function make CA an
ideal example of convergent evolution.17,18 To adapt with
environmental changes, different classes of CAs change their overall
secondary structure without altering their active site. All of these
classes are of ancient origin and appear to have evolved independently
from one another, having a zinc metal ion in their active site. α-CA
has three conserved histidine residues in the active site (Figure S2).19,20

and Ssp α-CA, b. Structural alignment of Ng α-CA and Ssp
α-CA. These two alignments clearly show the presence of similarity
in the protein tertiary structure in spite of differences in the amino
acid sequence.

In this study, we have
chosen prokaryotic α-CAs, as they
are inexpensive as well as easily available for experimental validation
and concurrent production using cell lines. One of the major requirements
to make the project successful is the productivity of the enzyme.
To develop the protein, we depend on an Escherichia
coli-based bacterial expression system for simple
reasons: E. coli (1) is well characterized,
(2) has a faster growth rate, and (3) requires optimized growth conditions
both in shake flasks and bioreactors. Thus, there is
a need for selecting a CA of mesophilic origin. We have selected α-CA
from Neisseria gonorrhoeae because
of its mesophilic origin, considering that it would be better to express
the protein in the E. coli expression
system. In addition to this, α-CA from N. gonorrhoeae has a high sequence identity and a structure nearly similar to that
of E. coli α-CA (Figure 2). Moreover, there are also
some other attributes for choosing a mesophilic model compared to
a thermophilic one. Besides the similarity
of α-CA between N. gonorrhoeae and E. coli, both organisms are Gram-negative
and inhabit similar types of environments, which further supports
our choice of mesophilic systems.

Figure 2 Sequence (left) and structure (right)
alignments between E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae α-CA. Remarkable similarities
have been observed from both sequence and structural points of view.

α-CAs are among the fastest
catalyzing enzymes; however,
one of the biggest challenges of using them in industries is that
they are not stable enough to withstand the harsh environment found
in the power plant exhaust. We have taken a highly interdisciplinary
approach including in silico techniques followed by genetic engineering
to develop an industrially stable, engineered α-CA that can
tolerate harsh operating conditions (in terms of temperature and pH)
typically encountered in CO2 capture processes for power
plant flue gas. The engineered enzyme could be immobilized to a membrane,
and the enzyme-tagged membrane could be used as a nanodevice to sequester
carbon dioxide from the flue gas outlet of the power plant.

In this study, our goal is to design a mesophilic α-CA (N. gonorrhoeae) with higher thermal stability while
retaining its enzyme activity. To gain insight into the unfolding
mechanism prior to the rationally designing the mutations,
comparative molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on
the mesophilic α-CA (N. gonorrhoeae)21 and a thermophilic α-CA (Sulfurohydrogenibium sp.)22,23 at temperatures
of 300, 350, 400, and 500 K, each for 100 ns. Using MD simulation
trajectories, different stability-determining variables such as root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), hydrogen bonds,
salt bridges,24−28 unfolding pathway, principal component analysis (PCA), and free-energy
landscape (FEL) were analyzed.29,30 On the basis of the
analyzed results, by comparing differences in those analyses of stability-determining
factors,31−34 a mutant variant of mesophilic α-CA was designed, containing
the variant residues: S44R, S139E, and K168R (Figure 3). This was followed by MD simulations at
the above-mentioned temperatures for the designed mutant. Analysis
not only reveals a sharp increase in the stability of the engineered
variant of α-CA but also predicts the stability to be comparable
to that of the thermophilic homologue.35,36 This study
would be a good platform for experimentally designing a construct
to develop a thermostable variant of industrially important enzyme.

Figure 3 The structure
with β sheets in yellow is mesophilic Ng α-CA,
and the structure with β sheets in blue is thermophilic Ssp
α-CA. On the basis of our comparative analysis of the distribution
of salt bridges in these two structures and their effect on stability,
we have designed a mutant variant of mesophilic Ng α-CA, whose
β sheets are shown in brown.

Results and Discussion
Salt Bridge Analysis
The bonds formed between the negatively
charged side chains of aspartic or glutamic acid and the positively
charged side chain of lysine or arginine are salt bridges, which stabilize
the secondary structure of proteins. The stability increases with
both increased number of salt bridges and the reduced distance between
two salt bridge-forming side chains.

In Ssp α-CA, there
are five salt bridges: Lys36NZ–Glu99OE1, Lys41NZ–Glu223OE1, Lys39NZ–Glu223OE1, Lys136NZ–Glu133OE1, and Arg165NH2–Glu223OE1. In place of
these salt bridges, Ng α-CA has four salt bridges: Arg136NH1–Asp194OD1, Arg136NH1–Asp194OD2, Arg136NH2–Asp194OD1, and Arg136NH2–Asp194OD2. In Ng α-CA,
these salt bridges are responsible only for the local stabilization
of Ng α-CA; however, in the case of Ssp α-CA, four salt
bridges are shown to stabilize a specific domain of the protein and
the remaining one stabilizes another domain. In Ssp α-CA, there
are a total of eight residues involved in salt bridge formation. MD
simulations show that the salt bridges of Ssp α-CA maintain
an overall fixed length throughout all of the temperature simulations.
But in the case of Ng α-CA, the salt bridge lengths vary in
a broad range and they are very unstable. The stable salt bridges
in Ssp α-CA are majorly responsible for its greater thermostability
compared to Ng α-CA.

On the basis of these observations,
we have introduced three mutations
in mesophilic Ng α-CA. From sequence and structure alignment,
we have found that the residues Lys41, Glu136, and Arg165 form salt
bridges in thermophilic α-CA, whereas they are absent in its
mesophilic counterpart. Mesophilic Ng α-CA contains Ser44, Ser139,
and Lys168 in place of those salt bridge-forming residues. From this
observation, we have designed a mutant variant consisting of S44R,
S139E, and K168R. As a result, the mutant variant contains five new
salt bridges. Glu226 in the mutant variant is involved in forming
four salt bridges with Arg44 and Arg168. Another salt bridge is formed
between Glu139 and Arg136. So, the mutant variant now contains a total
of nine salt bridges, resulting in enhanced stability compared to
its thermophilic counterpart.

We have analyzed the salt bridge
length variation of all of the
CA systems at four different simulation temperatures (300, 350, 400,
and 500 K) (Figure 4, Table 1). We have
found that the lengths of all of the salt bridges for mesophilic α-CA
fluctuate considerably, and at high temperatures, the salt bridges
become destabilized. At 300 K, the salt bridge-forming residues (Arg136
and Asp194) of Ng α-CA are located at α3 and β11.
With increasing temperature, the β11 secondary structure disintegrates,
making Asp194 flexible. This causes weakening of the Arg136–Asp194
salt bridge. In addition, it stimulates the loss of an α3 secondary
structure imposing instability to Arg136. These cumulative effects
make the Arg136–Asp194 salt bridge fully unstable at 500 K.

simulations. c. mutant Ng α-CA: Change in three residues results
in several new salt bridges; as in Ssp-CA, the length remains intact
at higher temperatures.

In the case of thermophilic α-CA, all of the
five salt bridges
remain stabilized and the lengths of the four salt bridges, Lys36–Glu99,
Lys39–Glu223, Arg165–Glu223, and Lys136–Glu133,
remain unchanged for all four temperature simulations. It has also
been observed that three salt bridge-forming residues of Ssp α-CA,
Lys39, Lys41, and Glu223 remain in the loop at 300 K but occupy β1
and β11 secondary structures at higher temperatures (350, 400,
and 500 K). It can be concluded that it is this strong interaction
and the salt bridge network between these three residues that help
in the formation of the secondary structure in the thermophilic protein.
Also the two residues, Glu133–Lys136, which form a salt bridge,
maintain the stability of the α-helix in which they reside.

In the mutant variant, three modified residues, S44R, S139E, and
K168R, resulted in five new salt bridge interactions (Arg44NH1–Glu226OE2, Arg44NH2–Glu226OE2, Arg168NH1–Glu226OE1,
Arg168NH2–Glu226OE1, and Arg136NH1–Glu139OE2). These five new salt bridges show extra stability
at all four temperatures. In particular, the salt bridges formed between
mutant residues Arg44 and Arg168 with Glu226 remain significantly
stable even at 400 and 500 K. Salt bridges between Arg136 and Asp194,
which are common in both the wild-type and mutant variants, show differences
in bond length (6.6 and 4.0 Å respectively). Another stabilized
salt bridge in mutant α-CA (Arg136-Glu39) is found to maintain
its length within 4.0–4.9 Å throughout all temperature
simulations.

From the MD study of average salt bridge length
of all of the α-CA
systems, it is evident that more number of strong and comparatively
stable salt bridges in both thermophilic and mutant α-CA are
responsible for their greater thermal adaptability compared to the
mesophilic one. These stable salt bridges are also important for retaining
the local secondary structure content in thermophilic and mutant α-CA.
Modified residues in mutant α-CA form extra salt bridges, resulting
in a further increase in stability compared to the mesophilic α-CA,
as supported by other analyses such as RMSD, RMSF, PCA, and FEL.

Hydrogen Bonding Pattern
Like salt bridges, hydrogen
bonds are also important for maintaining the protein secondary structure.
Hydrogen bond from two different residues remains connected with each
other within 3.5 Å. In this study, we have considered two different
types of hydrogen bonds: (a) intramolecular hydrogen bonds (protein–protein)
and (b) intermolecular hydrogen bonds (protein–solvent) (Table S1).

Intramolecular Hydrogen
Bonds
This type of hydrogen
bond is responsible for maintaining the protein integrity and helps
in increasing the protein thermostability. With an increase in temperature,
the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds decreases, and the protein
becomes unstable. The average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds
in mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA are 168.20, 168.84, 160.62,
and 145.50 and 163.20, 164.19, 163.65, and 154.07, respectively at
300, 350, 400, and 500 K. The number of hydrogen bonds that maintain
the protein integrity decreases rapidly in the case of mesophilic
CA compared to the thermophilic one. This clearly depicts the importance
of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in maintaining the protein thermostability.
Mutant CA shows an even higher average number of hydrogen bonds at
300 K (170.18), which is nearly maintained up to 350 and 400 K (162.78
and 161.64). The number of average intramolecular hydrogen bonds in
the mutant also decreases to 148.72, which is higher than that in
the case of mesophilic CA at 500 K (145.50). These values of intramolecular
hydrogen bonds suggest that the mutant gains extra stability due to
the induced mutations (Table S1). A salt
bridge is the crucial reason here for the stability of those hydrogen
bonds in mutant α-CA. Five additional salt bridges were observed
in the mutant variant compared to mesophilic Ng α-CA (Arg44NH1–Glu226OE2, Arg44NH2–Glu226OE2, Arg168NH1–Glu226OE1, Arg168NH2–Glu226OE1, and Arg136NH1–Glu139OE2). But a more important factor is
the position of those salt bridges. They are distributed in the protein
rather than being on one particular side and bringing the loops together
(Figure S9). This distribution helps the
protein to hold the entire structural architecture, especially at
higher temperatures, enhancing stability.

Intermolecular Hydrogen
Bonds
Intermolecular hydrogen
bonds maintain the interactions between the protein and solvent. The
interaction between the protein and solvent molecule increases when
the hydrophobic core region of the protein gradually becomes unwrapped
with its unfolding. Surfacing of the hydrophobic region of protein
increases the affinity of the protein core to the solvent molecule.
The average number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in mesophilic
and thermophilic α-CA are 465.94, 432.88, 388.79, and 303.38
and 510.85, 457.73, 412.06, and 319.65, respectively. The decrease
in the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is less in the case
of mesophilic CA compared to its thermophilic counterpart across the
entire range of temperatures. Increased temperature also
causes the loss of intermolecular H-bonding in a protein–solvent
system even when the protein gradually unwraps from its native state
to an unfolded state. The number of protein–solvent intramolecular
hydrogen bonds rapidly decreases in the case of a comparatively stable
protein, as we can see in the case of Ssp α-CA and mutant Ng
α-CA. In such cases, fewer protein residues remain free for
interacting with the solvent and hence they are able to retain more
secondary content even at a high temperature. But in the case of mesophilic
protein such a rapid decrease in intramolecular H-bonds is not usual.
So, residues in the relatively less stable mesophilic Ng α-CA
remain bound to solvent molecules through intramolecular H-bonds.
This phenomenon causes structural instability of mesophilic Ng α-CA
at high temperatures. In the case of the mutant, average values of
intermolecular hydrogen bonds are 467.05, 434.24, 396.30, and 301.46,
respectively, for 300, 350, 400, and 500 K. So, the decrease in the
number of average intermolecular hydrogen bonds observed in thermophilic
and mutant proteins indicates that they have less unwrapping of their
hydrophobic core region compared to the mesophilic protein. Thus,
thermophilic and mutant proteins make fewer contacts with the outer
solvent molecule with increasing temperature and maintain their higher
stability (Table S1).

Unfolding Pathway
Analysis of the unfolding pathway
of a protein predicts the pattern in which it unwraps from its native
fully folded form to a completely unfolded state. Different protein
conformations obtained from successive time scales throughout the
MD simulation trajectory present specific stable and unstable domains
in the protein structure. Different secondary structure contents,
which stabilize protein’s three-dimensional (3D) conformations,
can also be determined by this method. In this study, the detection
of unfolding pathway suggests that the induced mutations in mesophilic
α-CA have a stabilizing influence on their corresponding secondary
structure elements, which in turn contribute to the overall rigidity
of the conformation (Figure 5). In short, we can look
through a protein at the intramolecular level to find important interactions
responsible for maintaining its stability during its proper folding.
Unfolding pathway of all three (mesophilic, thermophilic and mutant)
α-CAs were studied according to successive time scales of increased
temperature through their respective MD simulation trajectory.

Figure 5 Unfolding pathway
of (a) Ng α-CA, (b) Ssp α-CA, and
(c) mutant Ng α-CA. The study of unfolding pathway describes
how a protein unwraps from its fully folded form. (a) Ng α-CA:
presented in red and yellow; shows rapid loss in its secondary structure
contents along its unfolding pathway, mostly at all different temperatures.
(b) Ssp α-CA: in different shades
of blue; no significant loss observed at the initial temperature,
but with an increase in temperature, shortening of the α1 and
α2 helices has been observed at higher temperatures but later
reappear with greater stability. (c) mutant Ng α-CA: presented
in brown shades; follows a pathway more similar to the thermophilic
protein, secondary structure contents are mostly maintained in compact
form during all of the temperature simulations.

Mesophilic α-CA shows significant
loss in its secondary structure
contents along its unfolding pathway, mostly at all different temperatures.
The α4 helix gradually decreases in size for the 300 K temperature
simulation and is eliminated from the 20 to 80 ns time scale. This
is probably caused by a certain increase in RMSF values of the residues
Ala159–Leu162 in this region. Moreover, the N-terminus of the
largest β-sheet in the core hydrophobic twisted β-sheet
region becomes shorter at 50 ns and onward during the 300 K temperature
simulation. This N-terminal region of the β-sheet in mesophilic
α-CA shows visible loss of its contents also at 10, 30, 40,
80, and 100 ns time scale of the 350 K temperature simulation. This
extended fragment of core β-sheet is so unstable that it turns
into a loop at the 30–100 ns time scale at 400 K. At higher
temperatures like 500 K, no trace is found for this region between
the time scale of 40 and 100 ns. The residue, Arg84, at the tip of
the N-terminus of the above-mentioned β-sheet has a salt bridge
interaction with Asp116 of its next β-sheet. This salt bridge
becomes distorted between those time scales at 500 K, causing the
deformation of the β-sheet part. The N-terminus of the α3
helix disappears and transforms into a loop in mesophilic α-CA
at 50–100 ns at 350 K. This part of the α3 helix also
disappears at 40 and 80 ns at 500 K. Arg136 of α3 forms a salt
bridge with Asp194 from β11 at the beginning time scale of the
350 K simulation. This salt bridge breaks up between 50 and 100 ns
at 350 K and 40 and 80 ns at 500 K, causing the disappearance of both α3
and β11. Both α1 and α2 helices disappear at 40
and 50 ns of the 400 K temperature simulation in mesophilic α-CA
and transform into a loop. The α1 helix is shown to reappear
after 50 ns and exist till the end of the 400 K simulation. Lys25
of α1 has a salt bridge interaction with Glu12 from the N-terminus
loop of the protein. This salt bridge remains stable up to the 1–30
ns time scale of the 400 K simulation but after that, the salt bridge
breaks down, resulting in the deformation of α1. Lys37 of α2
makes two salt bridges with Asp35 from the adjacent N-terminus loop.
These salt bridges remain stable up to the 1–30 ns time scale
of the 400 K simulation. After that, the amine side chain of Lys37
moves toward a direction in which the salt bridges deform and α2
transforms into a loop. Between the time range of 20 and 60 ns of
the 500 K simulation, a short 310 helix appears at the
C-terminus of mesophilic α-CA. Another 310 helix
appears adjacent to the previously mentioned 310 helix
at the end of the 500 K simulation. Frequent formation of such 310 helices indicates weak interatomic interactions between
the backbone residues at different local regions of mesophilic α-CA,
leading to the massive loss of secondary structure contents. All of
the α-helices gradually decrease in size and finally disappear
at 70 ns at 500 K. The β-sheets in the core of the twisted hydrophobic
region also become very short in size, imparting structural instability
to mesophilic α-CA at 500 K.

For thermophilic α-CA,
no significant loss or deviation of
the secondary structure content from the initial conformation has
been noticed. All of the β-sheets, especially the largest sheet
in the central region of the hydrophobic twisted β-sheet region,
remain structurally intact and stable all along the temperature simulations.
A 310 helix in the structure of thermophilic α-CA
frequently appears at 10, 50, 70, and 100 ns time scale of the 300
K simulation. The salt bridges between Lys37 and Asp35 remain stable
at those time scale of the 300 K simulation, which might be the cause
of the repetitive appearance of this 310 helix. Shortening
of the N-terminal of α1 and α2 helices has been observed
at 350 and 400 K, but later these helices, especially α1, reappear
with greater stability and remain intact for the rest of the simulations,
even at the end of the 500 K temperature simulation. The stabilization
of both α1 and α2 helices is mainly caused by the formation
of salt bridges between Gln16 of α1 and Lys25 of α2.

In the case of mutant α-CA, most of its secondary structure
contents are maintained in a compact form for an extended time scale
during all of the temperature simulations. There are no visible changes
or significant loss in its secondary structure up to 80 ns at 300
K. Specifically small structural fluctuation has been observed in
the core twisted β-sheet region and the surface β-8 region.
At 90 ns of the 300 K simulation, the N-terminus of the largest β-sheet
in the central hydrophobic core becomes reduced in size. The reduced
part of this β-sheet reappears at 100 ns at the same temperature.
The β8 sheet of mutant α-CA disappears at 20 ns in the
300 K simulation. The reduction of the N-terminus of the largest β-sheet
occurs again at 10, 20, 50, and 80 ns of the 350 K temperature simulation.
But this part remained fully compact for the rest of the time scale
at 350 K. At 400 K, this part of the largest core β-sheet reduces
at 30, 80, and 90 ns. At 500 K, the N-terminus of the β-sheet
remains obsolete from 10 to 40 ns. But after that time scale, this β-sheet
remains intact in full length for the rest of the simulation time
at 500 K. The stability and reappearance of the core β-sheet
in all of the above-mentioned cases are mainly because of the existence
of a strong salt bridge between Arg104 and Glu129. Interestingly,
at the end of the simulation at 500 K, an extra β-sheet is formed.
The appearance of the small fragment of this β-sheet might be
due to the formation of an adjacent 310 helix. Asp194 of
the small β-sheet fragment has a salt bridge interaction with
Arg136 of the 310 helix. On the other hand, the 310 helix is formed due to the generation of a salt bridge between the
mutant residue Glu139 and Arg136. The contributions from both this
β-sheet and 310 helix probably have some impact in
retaining the other secondary structure of the mutant α-CA,
mostly intact at higher temperatures.

The protein secondary
structure loses its integrity with increasing
temperature. Increasing temperature also results in a high rate of
dynamism in the structure. This leads to the possibility of formation
of newer bonds, which is not possible at normal temperature. If two
amino acids have side chains far apart while forming some interaction,
then with increasing temperature, the kinetic energy increases and
the side chains come together. That would lead to the formation of
some stronger bonds, which is not possible at lower temperatures.

Comparative unfolding pathway depicts that Ng α-CA lost most
of its secondary structure significantly from 70 to 100 ns at 500
K. Notably, it can be found that helical contents are totally absent
at the 70 ns time scale of the 500 K simulation in Ng α-CA,
and all of them transform into extended and flexible loops. On the
other hand, both Ssp α-CA and mutant Ng α-CA retain all
their secondary contents at those high temperatures. Moreover, we
have also reported that, during the time scale of 70, 80, and 100
ns of the 500 K temperature simulation, Ssp α-CA and Ng α-CA
show some small β-plated sheets on their surface, which seem
to be responsible for their higher thermostability.

The energy
compensation for the formation of such secondary structures
with increasing temperature has already been discussed in the section
of FEL. A protein has to cross a high-energy barrier for the deformation
of those types of temporarily stable secondary structures. In our
study, for thermophilic Ssp α-CA and mutant Ng α-CA, the
frequency of occurrence of such structures is more than that in its
mesophilic counterpart, which make them more thermostable.

Constraint
Network Analysis (CNA)
CNA is a graph-theory-based
rigidity analysis approach that determines global and local flexibility
and rigidity characteristics of any protein from the trajectory of
thermal unfolding simulations. By this method, relative differences
between a structurally weak and a stable region of a protein can be
detected with respect to thermal stability. We have used this method
to predict the thermostability of proteins and to identify structural
weak spots, that is, residues that upon mutation would improve a protein’s
thermostability. In this approach, a protein is modeled as a constraint
network where atoms are connected by sets of bars representing different
covalent and noncovalent interactions. A rigidity analysis performed
on this network results in the decomposition of the protein into rigid
parts and flexible links. Different noncovalent interactions (salt
bridges and hydrogen bonds) remain involved in maintaining the temperature-dependent
structural stability of a protein. By analyzing a series of networks
of such a protein and determining the involvement of those noncovalent
interactions, we are able to correlate the stability retention or
the rigidity loss with a thermal unfolding study. Throughout the temperature
gradient MD simulation study, we have that the rigid network becomes
almost flexible in mesophilic α-CA. Comparatively, we have observed
that both thermophilic and mutant α-CA are prone to retain most
of their interaction networks even at a high temperature. These phase
transitions in all of the α-CA have been related to the thermodynamics
of structural compactness provided by FEL.

Mutant residues Arg44
and Arg168 form additional salt bridge interactions with Glu226 in
the newly engineered α-CA. These additional salt bridges are
supposed to be responsible for the formation of a greater and rigid
interaction network adjacent to those newly formed salt bridges in
the mutant α-CA. This type of rigid interaction network is the
main reason for acquiring increased thermal stability in both thermophilic
and mutant α-CA.

PCA
PCA is used to determine the
movement of the protein
backbone during the MD simulation. The majority of the protein backbone
motion is determined by the first two principal components. The protein
backbone motion is plotted in two-dimensional covariance matrices
as a function of principal component 1 (PC1) and principal component
2 (PC2).

Both eigenvalues (PC1 and PC2) of mesophilic Ng α-CA
fluctuate between −50 and +50 Å at 300 K, whereas PC1
of Ssp α-CA ranges between −100 and +50 and PC2 from
−50 to +50 Å. For the mutant, both PC1 and PC2 values
range between −50 and +100 Å. The range of both PC1 and
PC2 of mesophilic α-CA increases compared to thermophilic α-CA,
which is (−150, +150) at 350 K. In the case of thermophilic
α-CA, the PC1 value ranges between −200 and +100 Å,
and the PC2 value remains in the range −100 to +100 Å.
For mutant α-CA, the PC1 and PC2 values range between −50
to +100 Å and −50 to +50 Å, respectively. Visible
changes in backbone motion have been reported in the case of Ng α-CA
at 400 K, in which the PC1 value fluctuates from −200 to +200
and the PC2 value from −250 to +200. On the other hand, the
PC1 and PC2 values of thermophilic α-CA range within a small
scale, −150, +150 Å (PC1) and −100, +100 Å
(PC2). For the mutant, the PC1 value ranges between −150 and
+250 Å, and PC2 ranges between −200 and +75 Å. Similarly,
at 500 K, larger flexibility along both eigenvectors (PC1: −35,
+45 Å; PC2: −35, +30 Å) is shown by Ng α-CA.
In the case of thermophilic α-CA, the fluctuations of the protein
backbone along with the eigenvectors are less (PC1: −300, +250
Å and PC2: −200, +150 Å). In mutant α-CA, PC1
ranges between −270 and +300 Å, and PC2 ranges between
−250 and +200 Å.

Essential Dynamics (ED)
ED analyses
during PCA have
been performed to monitor the overall concerted motion of all of the
three proteins, mesophilic, thermophilic, and mutant α-CA, at
different temperatures. To examine the efficiency of the sampling
of conformational space, we have calculated the cosine content of
the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) at all of the temperatures.

In ED calculations, we have calculated the degree of backbone overlap
of an individual protein at different temperatures. As mesophilic
α-CA is comparatively unstable compared to thermophilic and
mutant ones, it shows less percentage of overlap between the backbones
of different conformations at various temperatures. Thermophilic and
mutant α-CA show comparatively larger number of conformations
with their backbone overlap. This pattern of ED reveals that thermophilic
and mutant α-CA have smaller fluctuations at different local
domains compared to mesophilic α-CA. In this analysis, it is
also reported
that the comparatively stable thermophilic and mutant α-CA proteins
have their backbone motion mostly in the same direction for different
conformations throughout the trajectories of temperature gradient,
whereas the relatively less stable mesophilic α-CA shows residual
backbone motion mostly in the opposite two directions for different
conformations throughout the time scale of the temperature gradient
MD simulation trajectory. The width of the ribbon in all of the three
types of α-CA proteins represents the degree of backbone motion.
The ribbon representation of the ED for all of these proteins shows
different amplitudes of motion of a specific region of those proteins.
From our study, it is clear that mesophilic α-CA has visible
expansion and a larger dimension of the ribbon compared with thermophilic
and mutant α-CA. The region of the largest β-sheet in
the core hydrophobic β-twisted region and the surface β8
region in mesophilic α-CA shows a greater dispersion in backbone
motion. Compared to that in this scenario, thermophilic and mutant
α-CA show less amplitude of motion in those regions. This observation
is also supported by the finding of the unfolding pathway.

From
the comparative ED and PCA, we are able to correlate the role
of stabilizing and destabilizing salt bridge-forming residues in maintaining
thermal stability. There are some destabilizing salt bridge-forming
residue pairs in mesophilic Ng α-CA: Lys102–Arg104, Arg136–Lys165,
Lys165–arg166, Arg166–Lys168, and Lys132–Arg136,
which are mainly responsible for the larger domain-specific fluctuation
compared to the thermophilic one. The corresponding residue pairs
in the case of thermophilic α-CA are Glu99–Lys101, Glu133–Lys162,
Lys162–Asp163, Asp163–Arg165, and Lys99–Glu133.
Among them Glu99, Glu133, Asp163, and Arg165 are shown to form stabilizing
salt bridges and assumed to have an impact on the small fluctuations
of backbone atoms along the two principal eigenvectors. In
the case of mutant α-CA, stabilizing salt bridge-forming residues
Glu139 and Arg168 are responsible for the lower backbone atom fluctuation,
as in thermophilic α-CA.

The above-mentioned comparative
PCA values of mesophilic and thermophilic
α-CA reveal that thermophilic and mutant Ssp α-CA have
less backbone motion than their mesophilic counterpart. Less backbone
motion and atomic degree of motion indicate rigid and stable conformations
of thermophilic and mutant α-CA at higher temperatures (Figures 6 and S7).

Figure 6 PCA for a. Ng α-CA, b. Ssp α-CA,
and c. mutant Ng α-CA.
PCA determines the movement of protein backbone during the MD simulation,
which is extremely critical to understand protein unfolding. a. Ng
α-CA: shows rapid increase in backbone movement with increasing
temperature, b. Ssp α-CA: relatively less spreading throughout
the simulations at all temperatures and c. mutant Ng α-CA: shows
movement quite similar to Ssp-CA but increases significantly for the
500 K simulation.

FEL
The corresponding FEL as a function of the principal
components describes the energy distribution of a protein-folding
pathway. It depicts the stability of protein in terms of the Gibbs
free energy and analyzes different conformational states as a function
of energy for each residue involved.  Here, ΔG defines the
Gibbs Free energy and is a function of K and TB, which are the equilibrium constant and gas
constant, respectively, PA and PB are the probabilities of the occurrence of
the A conformation and B conformation, respectively, of a protein
in its dynamics pathway .

We have analyzed FEL from the MD simulation
trajectories of the simulated systems of the wild-type mesophilic,
thermophilic, and mutant α-CA. Interactive 3D plots have been
generated by using the Gibbs free energy as a function of two eigenvectors
(PC1 and PC2), obtained from the principal component analysis. The
principal component projected covariance matrix has been highlighted
with a contour map, showing different coloring patterns at the bottom
of each FEL plot. Each coloring pattern defines a range of energy
distribution in which the protein shows its different configurations.
Blue and red define the conformational spaces of a protein with minimum
energy (stable state) and maximum energy (unstable state), respectively.
Intermediate color patterns highlight the other transient local energy
states. In the case of α-CA, we get different intermediate states
for different temperature simulations. By detecting the intermediate
states and the energy profile of residues corresponding to each state,
we can detect the residues that are important for stabilizing those
intermediate states and regulating the activity. In combination, FEL
and conformation path sampling methods analyzed from MD simulation
trajectories help us locate different important states of α-CAs
during their folding pathways, which have biological significance
in maintaining thermal stability. A comparative analysis of FEL of
thermophilic, mesophilic, and mutant α-CA shows greater stability
for thermophilic and mutant α-CA.

A comparative analysis
of FEL of different temperatures shows that
the expansion of the energy funnel opening in Ng α-CA is more
than that of Ssp α-CA and the mutant one. Ng α-CA has
a larger sampling for the two principal component values than that
of Ssp α-CA. Significant difference in the expansion of the
FEL opening can be observed at a temperature of 350 K. At high temperatures,
that is, 500 K, the differences in the principal component values
become much higher between the mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA.
The number of intermediate states in Ng α-CA is more than that
in Ssp α-CA with multiple lower free-energy barriers in the
case of Ng α-CA. Because of this, the surface of FEL for Ng
α-CA is more rugged than that of Ssp α-CA. The higher
number of free-energy barriers in the Ng α-CA FEL than that
in Ssp α-CA and mutant α-CA indicates that each local
minimum of the landscape contains a stable conformation. Because of
the presence of a large number of intermediate conformations, Ng α-CA
takes longer time scales to fold into its native state. In addition,
the global minimum of free energy of Ng α-CA is higher than
that of the Ssp α-CA and mutant α-CA FEL. Another
cause of the slow folding of the mesophilic Ng α-CA protein
is that this protein has to cross more number of larger energy barriers
to transform from one intermediate conformation to the other. The
RMSD and Rg value differences are significantly
higher between the intermediate states of Ng α-CA compared to
those of Ssp α-CA and mutant α-CA. Because of this large
number of intermediate states between any two global minima in the
Ng α-CA protein, it has to transverse a large energy barrier
for proceeding along its folding pathway to achieve the native state.
Analyzing different conformations of mesophilic Ng α-CA from
the FEL plots of increasing temperature gradient compared to thermophilic
Ssp α-CA and mutant α-CA, it is clear that mesophilic
Ng α-CA is highly flexible and more unstable than its thermophilic
counterpart and mutant α-CA.

All of the FELs at different
temperatures show a trend that the
expansion of the opening of the landscape is much larger in the mesophilic
protein than its thermophilic counterpart and the mutant one (Figure 7). The sampling of
landscape becomes comparatively more with increasing temperature in
the case of mesophilic protein. It is further evident as the mesophilic
protein has more fluctuations in backbone motion and increased degree
of freedom compared to others. Because of its greater unfolding rate
and flexibility, the possibility of the occurrence of intermediate
conformations is much more than other variants. The wild-type mesophilic
α-CA sampled wider regions on the FEL than thermophilic and
mutant ones, significantly at 400 and 500 K. From 350 K onward to
500 K, the FELs of both thermophilic and mutant α-CA show the
presence of distinct basins separated by a relatively high free-energy
barrier compared to the wild-type mesophilic α-CA. At 350, 400,
and 500 K, thermophilic and mutant α-CA show a greater coverage
of conformational space along the first two PCs compared to the wild-type
mesophilic α-CA. In contrast, the wild-type mesophilic α-CA
is found to sample overlapping regions of conformational space, wherein
the conformations are largely clustered in regions along PC1 and PC2
due to the formation of weak hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic collapses.
Mesophilic α-CA shows large concerted motions in different parts
of the trajectories, represented by the movements along PC1 and PC2
eigenvectors. In contrast, thermophilic and mutant α-CA show
restricted motions, significantly in the N-terminal region (α-helix,
twisted β-sheets in the protein hydrophobic core, and loops)
and in the surface loops of the protein. Mesophilic α-CA possesses
a higher free energy of unfolding than thermophilic and mutant α-CA.
For this reason, thermophilic and mutant α-CA show more thermostability
than mesophilic α-CA.

Figure 7 FEL of a. Ng α-CA, b. Ssp α-CA,
and c. mutant Ng α-CA.
Coloring pattern defines the energy distribution; blue and red defines
the conformational space of a protein with minimum energy (stable
state) and maximum energy (unstable state), respectively. Intermediate
color patterns highlight the other transient local energy states. Energy
landscape follows similar pattern like PCA; i.e., the more spread
the landscape is, the more unfolded is the protein.

We have also characterized different
states and their free-energy
values. Different states of protein unfolding pathway, such as folded,
partially unfolded, hydrophobic collapsed, and unfolded states, are
labeled with 1, 2, 3, and 4 (major basins), respectively, in the energy
contour map at the bottom of the FEL plot (Figure 7). Thermophilic and mutant α-CA show
the least conformational fluctuation and movement in native (folded
states) or near-to-native basins, suggesting the existence of large
free energy barriers between native and non-native states (partially
unfolded states). In contrast, mesophilic α-CA shows rapid transitions
from native to non-native FEL basins, suggesting its increased tendency
to sample conformationally distant non-native states at high temperatures.
Notably, the wild-type mesophilic α-CA shows a higher fluctuation
than thermophilic and mutant α-CA and follows a constricted
transition pathway from native to non-native FEL basins (Figure 7).

Comparing
the average RMSD
values and analyzing the variation in hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
between major FEL basins, it was evident that thermophilic and mutant
α-CA resist the breaking of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
and hence, remain close to the native conformations at high temperatures
(Tables S2–S4).

pKa Calculation
From pKa calculations, we have found that Ssp α-CA
has a pKa value (6.9) near 7 at a pH of
8, whereas mesophilic Ng α-CA has a comparatively lower pKa value of 6.7 at the same pH. This result implicates
that the histidine (His64 in Ssp α-CA) remain in a more deprotonated
state relative to mesophilic Ng α-CA His66. Thus, His64 from
Ssp α-CA is more capable of abstracting the proton from the
water attached to the zinc ion. Therefore, the rate of nucleophilic
attack on the carbon of CO2 by the deprotonated hydroxyl
group (Zn–OH) is more in Ssp α-CA. More
interestingly, in the case of the newly designed mutant Ng α-CA,
we have calculated the pKa value of His66
to be 6.8, higher than that of the wild-type histidine. From this,
it can be assumed that mutant Ng α-CA comes up with more enzymatic
activity than the wild-type Ng α-CA in addition to its thermal
stability, as in thermophilic Ssp α-CA.

Dynamics Study of Zn–HisND1
Involved in the Proton Shuttle
From the MD simulation trajectories,
we have compared the conformations
of the catalytic histidine residue (involved in the proton shuttle)
and the Zn–HisND1 distance for all of the three systems: Ng
α-CA, Ssp α-CA, and mutant Ng α-CA. Considering
the HisND1–Zn distance of up to 8 Å for the optimum catalytic
activity of α-CA, we have identified those “in”
conformers that facilitate the proton shuttle. At 300 K, we have reported
two “in” conformers of the catalytic histidine each
for Ng α-CA (50, 80 ns) and Ssp α-CA (20, 60 ns). The
distances of HisND1–Zn for Ng α-CA for these two conformers
are 7.4 and 7.5 Å, whereas in the case of Ssp α-CA, these
distances are 7.2 and 7.4 Å, respectively. At 350 K, His66 of
Ng α-CA shows a comparatively larger number of “in”
conformations for time scales 10–50, 70, and 90 ns. The HisND1–Zn
distances in Ng α-CA for those time scales at 350 K are 7.6,
7.7, 8.0, 7.2, 7.3, 7.9, and 6.7, respectively. At the same temperature,
Ssp α-CA shows an “in” conformer of His64 only
at the 90 ns time scale, which has a HisND1–Zn distance of
7.4. At 400 K, mesophilic Ng α-CA shows five “in”
conformers of His66 within a HisND1–Zn distance of 8 Å
at the time scale of 20 ns and from 50 to 80 ns. For thermophilic
Ssp α-CA, we have reported three “in” conformers
of His64 at the 50, 70, and 80 ns time scale. In these three conformers,
the distances between Zn and HisND1 are much less, which are 4.5,
4.2, and 4.0 Å, respectively. The comparative HisND1–Zn
distance between those “in” conformers of catalytic
histidine of Ng α-CA and Ssp α-CA implies that less HisND1–Zn
distance is more compatible for a fast proton transfer in the case
of Ssp α-CA to attain its maximum enzymatic activity even at
temperatures as high as 400 K. In the case of mutant Ng α-CA,
three “in” conformers have been observed at 400 K, which
have HisND1–Zn distances of 7.5, 7.7, and 7.2 at 40, 60, and
100 ns, respectively. At 500 K, mesophilic Ng α-CA has two “in”
conformers of His66 with HisND1–Zn distances of 6.9 and 7.8
Å at 50 and 70 ns, respectively. Even for thermophilic Ssp α-CA,
there are two “in” conformers of His64 with HisND1–Zn
distances of 6.8 and 6.7 Å at 10 and 20 ns, respectively. At
500 K, the mutant Ng α-CA shows two “in” conformers
of its His66 with HisND1–Zn distances of 6.3 and 7.5 Å
at 20 and 40 ns, respectively. More interestingly, if we successively
compare the HisND1–Zn distance of mutant Ng α-CA at 10
ns with the wild-type Ng α-CA HisND1–Zn distance at 50
ns and the same at 40 ns for mutant Ng α-CA and at 70 ns for
wild-type Ng α-CA, then we can find that the distances are comparatively
less for mutant Ng α-CA (Table 2). In addition, for thermophilic Ssp α-CA, the
HisND1–Zn distances for the two “in” conformers
of His64 are also less compared to those for mesophilic Ng α-CA.
This quantitative analysis of HisND1–Zn distance and the conformation
of catalytic histidine residues among Ng α-CA, Ssp α-CA,
and mutant Ng α-CA imply that the rate of proton shuttle is
faster in both Ssp α-CA and mutant Ng α-CA. Faster
proton shuffling results higher enzymatic activity of thermophilic
Ssp α-CA and mutant Ng α-CA, compared to the wild-type
mesophilic Ng α-CA at a high temperature of 500 K. The higher
enzymatic activity of Ssp α-CA and mutant Ng α-CA compared
to that of wild-type Ng α-CA is also supported by the relative
pKa values that we have estimated later
and is in good agreement with the analysis of the HisND1–Zn
distance from the MD simulation study.

Determination of the Melting Temperature
(Tm)
In this study, we have tried
to complement
the experimental evidence with one of the most efficient theoretical
predictions. Here, we have theoretically calculated the denaturation
temperature or Tm of mesophilic Ng α-CA,
thermophilic Ssp α-CA, and mutant Ng α-CA, using the CNA.
The method
of Tm prediction can well mimic the experimental
method of Circular Dichroism (CD), which determines the effects of
mutations and ligands on protein and polypeptide stability with respect
to the change in CD as a function of temperature. This also determines
the enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of unfolding, the midpoint of the unfolding transition
(TM), and the free energy (ΔG) of unfolding
(1). Likewise, in the Tm prediction method,
a thermal unfolding simulation has been performed on each of the system.
During the calculation of Tm, two other
order parameters have also been considered, which are protein’s
backbone rigidity and deformation energy for intraprotein hydrogen
bonds. The unfolding transition calculated in CD is calibrated as
a phase transition in the Tm prediction
method (2). A comparative stability graph of the calibrated melting
temperatures of the three proteins reveals that thermophilic Ssp α-CA
has the highest Tm among all, and it is
348 K (75 °C), whereas its mesophilic counterpart Ng α-CA
has the lowest Tm of 312 K (39 °C)
compared to the other two protein systems. Mutant Ng α-CA has
a Tm of 333 K (60 °C), close to that
of thermophilic Ssp α-CA (Figure 8). The other two factors, rigidity and H-bond energy,
calculated along with the melting temperature are also in good agreement
with the comparative stability of the above three proteins. The melting
temperature actually defines the moment when the rigidity of the protein
backbone and the H-bond energy suddenly drop to a significantly low
level. In the figure, the red bar indicates the melting temperature
for individual proteins. It can be commented from the figure that
mesophilic Ng α-CA starts to denature quickly than thermophilic
Ssp α-CA and mutant Ng α-CA. Thermophilic Ssp α-CA
is shown to retain its backbone rigidity the most, even at a high
temperature of 348 K (75 °C). Mutant Ng α-CA is
also shown to contain more number of high-energy H-bonds and a higher
rigidity index up to a temperature of 333 K (60 °C), reflecting
its greater stability than wild-type Ng α-CA.

Conclusions
In the current study, comparative MD simulation
has been used for
understanding the molecular basis of different thermostabilities in
mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA. Different stability comparing
factors, such as RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA,
hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, secondary structure content, unfolding
pathway, PCA, CNA, ED and FEL, pKa, melting
temperature, have been detected for both the mesophilic and thermophilic
α-CA. Comparative analyses of those stability-determining factors
of mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA guided us to develop a set
of mutations in mesophilic α-CA in search for increased thermostability.
Finally, we have designed
to induce three mutations (S44R, S139E, and K168R) in mesophilic α-CA
through a detailed analysis from sequence comparison, RMSF values,
and detection of stabilizing and destabilizing salt bridges. All of
the above-mentioned stability-determining factors have also been analyzed
for mutant α-CA, and the results clearly show that the mutant
becomes more thermostable than the wild type and becomes comparable
to thermophilic α-CA with regard to stability. Salt bridge analysis
shows that mutant α-CA evolves to form five new salt bridges
that impart extra thermostability. In addition, the RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA values for mutant α-CA become
reduced compared to the mesophilic one at higher temperatures. PCA
shows
that mutant α-CA traverses through comparatively fewer conformational
spaces than wild-type mesophilic α-CA, representing greater
structural rigidity of mutant α-CA. The Comparative ED analysis
of these three proteins explains the difference in thermal stability
in accordance with PCA results. CNA also proves that the newly designed
mutant α-CA has a more compact interaction network compared
to the wild-type protein. The FEL analysis shows that wild-type mesophilic
α-CA follows a constricted pathway from a native to a non-native
state through less populated intermediate states. This actually supports
the experimental observation regarding the irreversible folding-to-unfolding
transition of wild-type mesophilic α-CA at higher temperatures.
The comparative FEL analysis reveals that mutant α-CA has more
number of native-like intermediate states with lower aggregation propensities
compared to wild-type mesophilic α-CA. This finding explains
the variation in stabilities between mesophilic and mutant α-CA,
which is also in good agreement with other different analyses from
the MD simulation trajectory. The newly designed mutant revealed that
the improved stability has resulted from a reduced rate of protein
unfolding and a decreased rate of precipitation of the unfolding intermediates.
In contrast to mesophilic α-CA, mutant α-CA, like the
thermophilic homologue, shows a deep and rugged FEL surface near the
native state at 500 K. Throughout the analysis of different states
of FEL, we have shown that mutant α-CA stays mostly in those
conformations that retain stable salt bridges and hydrogen bonds.
Such conformations help the mutant variant to remain stable even at
extremely high temperatures. On the basis of the discussed results,
we propose that mutant α-CA possesses both structural rigidity
required to adapt in high temperatures (like the thermophilic homologue)
and flexibility in catalytically important regions (like its originator,
mesophilic α-CA) needed for optimum enzymatic activity at those
high temperatures.

The in silico approach followed in this study
provides new insights
into protein engineering. Mutational study to understand or alter
protein functions has been a very powerful tool for decades, but there
is less correlation between the structural and functional roles of
an amino acid. This frequently leads to the design of unstable proteins,
resulting in poor or no expression of the mutant variants when treated
experimentally. This clearly results in huge loss of manpower and
money. The most interesting analyses of this study are the pKa calculation and the determination of melting
temperature (Tm), both of which actually
compensate for the experimental study. The pKa calculation shows that the designed mutant mesophilic α-CA
is a more active enzyme than the wild-type one, and the Tm calculation confirms its thermal stability as being
close to that of thermophilic α-CA. In future, this study would
work as a platform not only to help further design thermally stable
and industrially important proteins, which would be applicable in
diverse biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and biomedical fields at
relatively high temperatures, but also to provide a basis for designing
mutants with better chance to be produced successfully under experimental
conditions.

Materials and Methods
Basis of Mutant Construction of α-CA
To construct
a thermostable mutant α-CA, we have gone through successive
steps of analyzing the sequence, structure and then detecting its
stability using MD simulations of the mutant protein.36,37We
have first analyzed a number of comparative sequence and structural
factors, such as number of proline and charged residues, total SASA,
number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, for mesophilic and thermophilic
α-CA.38 From their corresponding
sequence alignments, we have found that the number of proline residues
is greater in the mesophilic α-CA protein than that in the thermophilic
one. Proline residues take part in secondary structure deformation
and hence are mostly found in the loop region. Proline is also known
for making the loops rigid. Structural analysis shows that thermophilic
α-CA has all its proline residues in the loop region, whereas
in its mesophilic counterpart, two proline residues are excluded from
the loop, and thus, we have hypothesized that they might have some
role in destabilizing the secondary structure contents. Thermophilic
α-CA has more number of charged residues (Arg, Lys, Asp, and
Glu) than its mesophilic homologue. In particular, there are more
surface-oriented charged residues in the case of thermophilic α-CA
compared to the mesophilic one.39 The number
of intrachain hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are also greater in
thermophilic α-CA. The total SASA is greater for mesophilic
α-CA than thermophilic, which implies rapid unpacking of the
core hydrophobic region of the mesophilic protein than its thermophilic
counterpart. All of the above results support the enhanced stability
of thermophilic α-CA over mesophilic α-CA (Table 3).

From the above sequence and
structure-based analysis, we accumulate
some ideas about the significant flexible region in the mesophilic
protein compared to its thermophilic homologue, where we can introduce
mutation to enhance its stability. We have first used the RMSF values
obtained from the MD simulation to identify these types of flexible
regions in mesophilic proteins.40 From
the sequence alignment between mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA,
we have then further identified the residues in the mesophilic protein,
which correspond to the salt bridge-forming residues in the thermophilic
one. Then, we have selected the surrounding residues (8 Å radius)
of those individual mesophilic residues and have further compared
the RMSF values of all of those residues with their thermophilic counterpart.
We have found some residues of mesophilic α-CA showing high
RMSF values at all of the temperatures as compared to the thermophilic
one. Residues of mesophilic α-CA that show approximately two
to four times greater RMSF than the corresponding thermophilic α-CA
residues are Ser44, Asn134, Arg136, Ser139, Trp141, Pro164, Arg166,
Lys168, Tyr169, Arg171, Leu188, and Tyr193. In addition to that, in
thermophilic α-CA there is a compact network between the salt
bridge-forming residues, such as Lys36, Lys39, Lys41, Glu99, Arg165,
and Glu223. Structural analysis also revealed that the main differences
between wild-type mesophilic α-CA and its thermophilic homologue
are the organization of salt bridges involved in the above-mentioned
surface residues. The corresponding mesophilic α-CA residues
in this region are Glu41, Ser44, Lys102, Lys168, and Glu226, which
show comparatively increased RMSF value at all temperatures.41,42 Increased RMSF values might also be a reason for not forming any
salt bridges in this region in the case of mesophilic α-CA.
We have also found some destabilizing salt bridges in the mesophilic
protein, which are Lys102–Arg104, Arg136–Lys165, Lys165–Arg166,
Arg166–Lys168, and Lys132–Arg136. The corresponding
residues in the thermophilic protein for these positions are interestingly
a pair of two oppositely charged residues. In thermophilic α-CA,
these pairs of residues are Glu99–Lys101, Glu133–Lys162,
Lys162–Asp163, Asp163–Arg165, and Lys129–Glu133
(Table 4).43 All of these residues of thermophilic α-CA
show significantly low RMSF values than the corresponding mesophilic
α-CA residues (Table 5). Glu99, Glu133, Asp163, and Arg165 from those pairs of oppositely
charged residues are shown to form salt bridges in thermophilic α-CA.

a RMSF values in bold represent comparatively
less fluctuation of thermophilic residues corresponding to its mesophilic
residues at the respective temperature.

According to the significant changes in RMSF values
and destabilizing
salt bridges in the mesophilic protein, we have introduced some mutations.
Our first choice of mutation is S44R because we have found that the
residue Serine in this position of mesophilic α-CA does not
form any salt bridge, whereas at the same position, Lysine form a
salt bridge with Glu223 in thermophilic α-CA. Moreover, the
RMSF value of Ser44 is about double in mesophilic α-CA compared
to Lys41 of thermophilic α-CA because of the absence of the
salt bridge. By mutating Ser44 to arginine, we want to develop maximum
number of salt bridges, contributing to higher stability. From the
structure and chemistry of amino acids, it is known that the side
chain of lysine contains only one charged amino group, whereas arginine
has two. So, arginine has the potential of forming more number of
salt bridges with surrounding oppositely charged residues. And our
hypothesis is duly supported by the outcome. In the case of the mutant,
Arg44 has formed three salt bridges with the Glu226 residue, whereas
in the case of its thermophilic counterpart, two salt bridges were
observed between Lys41 and Glu223. Moreover, the presence of more
salt bridges between Arg44 and Glu226 in the mutant imparts higher
rigidity to the system, enhancing the structural stability in comparison
to its thermophilic counterpart. This could be confirmed by comparing
the 400 and 500 K MD simulation frames for thermophilic and mutant
proteins. An increment in the distance between these two residues
(Lys41 and Glu223) would be observed in the case of thermophilic proteins,
whereas such an alternation is absent in the mutant protein. Because
of the above-mentioned facts, we have decided to choose arginine over
lysine in place of Ser44 to achieve better thermal stability for mutant
α-CA (Figure S10). Arg136 already
forms salt bridges with Asp194 in mesophilic α-CA, so we did
not substitute it in spite of having two destabilizing salt bridge
partners: Lys132 and Lys165. Arg136 of mesophilic α-CA shows
larger RMSF than the corresponding salt bridge-forming residue Glu133
in thermophilic α-CA. Searching for an alternative, we have
found that by altering Ser139 to Glutamate, there is a chance for
the formation of a salt bridge between Arg136 and Glu139. The newly
constructed salt bridge might have some effect to hold the destabilizing
salt bridge partner Arg136 and thereby provide additional stability.
We have predicted that the salt bridge between Glu139 and Arg136 might
also make Glu139 less flexible in the designed mutant than the Ser139
in wild-type mesophilic α-CA. In mesophilic α-CA, the
residue Lys168 cannot form any salt bridge with its nearby oppositely
charged residue Glu226 because it also has a destabilizing salt bridge
partner Arg166. So, we have postulated that by constructing the mutant
K168R, we might be able to diminish the effect of the destabilizing
salt bridge (Figure S8). From the RMSF
value, it can also be shown that Lys168 of mesophilic α-CA is
larger than the corresponding Arg165 of the thermophilic protein,
which also supports our approach to mutate Lys168 to arginine. We
have hypothesized
that in the mutant, we might have a high probability of finding salt
bridges between substituted residues Arg168 and Glu226, and this will
play a key role in enhancing thermal stability.44

System-Setup
The crystal structures
of two homologous
α-CA from mesophilic N. gonorrhoeae (PDB ID: 1KOQ)21 and thermophilic Sulfurohydrogenibium sp. (PDB ID: 4G7A)22 were used as starting models for the
MD simulations.45 Crystal structures of
mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA have resolutions of 1.80 and
1.90 Å and the B-factors of 22.94 and 17 Å2 with
residue numbers 2-225 and 5-226, respectively. We have performed MD
simulations of both wild-type and mutant α-CAs. We have introduced
three mutations into mesophilic Ng α-CA (S44R, S139E, and K168R)
by using the COOT46 software. We have then
performed MD simulations of mutant protein and have shown comparative
thermal stabilities for both wild-type α-CAs.

MD Simulation
We have used GROMACS 4.5.445 and OPLS-AA
all atom force field47,48 for MD simulations, on an Intel
Xeon Quad Core W3530 2.8 8 M 1366
Processor with LINUX environment. Mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA
were solvated in a cubic box (dimension with 74.8 × 74.8 ×
74.8 and 74.6 × 74.6 × 74.6, respectively) filled with SPC216
water molecules (12 655 and 12 604, respectively).49 To simulate the solvated system in a neutral
pH, we have replaced solvent molecules with counter ions (5 Cl– for mesophilic α-CA and 11 Cl– for thermophilic α-CA).

The steepest descent method
of energy minimization was applied for all of the systems for an iteration
cycle of maximum 50 000 steps.50 The minimized systems were then equilibrated at four different temperatures
(300, 350, 400, and 500 K) to relax the system and maintain the constant
temperature and pressure of the system. A production run of 100 ns
was performed. Periodic boundary conditions were applied under isothermal
and isobaric conditions, using Berendsen coupling algorithm with relaxation
times of 0.1 and 0.2 ps, respectively.51 The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain bond lengths using a time
step of 2 fs for both systems.52 Electrostatic
interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald method,
and van der Waals and Coulombic interactions were calculated with
a cutoff at 1.0 nm.53

The tools provided
by the GROMACS package were utilized to analyze
different MD trajectories. Secondary structure analyses were performed
using the program DSSP.54 We used a web-based
server 2Struc55 that provides detailed
information regarding secondary structures, including α helices,
310 helices, β strands, β bridges, β
turns, and bends. Web server ESBRI56 was
used for salt bridge calculation and PyMOL,57 Chimera,58 VMD,59 COOT46 was used as the visualizing software.
PyMOL,57 Xmgrace,60 and MATLAB61 programs were used to analyze
and prepare the figures.

We have analyzed the key order parameters
that determine the molecular
basis of the thermal stability for each of the wild-type mesophilic
α-CA, thermophilic α-CA, and mutant mesophilic α-CA.
RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA have been calculated
and analyzed for the determination of thermal stability and their
differences.62

The salt bridges in
both homologues of α-CA protein were
calculated using a web-based tool ESBRI,56 using a cutoff value of 4.0 Å for salt bridge lengths. By comparing
the salt bridges in both mesophilic and thermophilic α-CA, we
identified some extra salt bridges, which maintain greater stability
in thermophilic α-CA, and replaced the corresponding residues
in mesophilic α-CA without perturbing the salt bridges already
present in wild-type mesophilic α-CA. After introducing those
residues, we have found that the initial structure of the mutant mesophilic
α-CA gained some extra salt bridges. In this way, we have designed
a mutant mesophilic α-CA containing three mutations (S44R, S139E,
and K168R) (Figure 6). Then, we investigated the increasing thermostability due to the
newly originated salt bridges in mutant α-CA. We have also analyzed
the variation of salt bridge length in all of the α-CA systems
as a function of different temperatures. The length variation of salt
bridges was analyzed with respect to the average PDB at a given temperature.
Improvement of the side chain conformation of each residue from all
of the average PDBs was performed using Scwrl4.63

The covariance matrices of the positional fluctuations
of Cα atoms were analyzed with PCA or ED.64,65 The first two principal components (PC1, PC2) contribute to the
major protein backbone motion and have been used for the PCA. The
covariance matrix was diagonalized to obtain the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues that provide information about correlated motions throughout
the protein. The FEL prepared using MATLAB61 describes the energy distribution and biological interrelation between
thermodynamics and protein stability.
