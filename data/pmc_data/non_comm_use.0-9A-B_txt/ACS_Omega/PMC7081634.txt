A phenyl-substituted diazaperylenediium
dication (DAP) was synthesized that shows concentration-dependent
aggregation in water. The host–guest complexation of DAP was
studied with the macrocyclic host cucurbit[n]uril
(n = 7, 8) in water. With CB[7], it forms a 1:2 complex
by placing two aryl substituents inside the CB[7]; whereas, with CB[8],
a supramolecular polymer is formed. The resulting complex and supramolecular
polymer have been characterized by ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry),
ESI-MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry), 1H
NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance), 2D NOESY (two-dimensional
nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), and DOSY (diffusion-ordered
spectroscopy) spectra.

Introduction
Polycyclic hydrocarbons
have unique optical1 and redox2 properties, which make them ideal candidates
for real-world applications.3 To tune these
properties, two main approaches have been used: aryl or alkyl substitution4 and introduction of a heteroatom5 in the core skeleton. Both of these approaches change the
key properties, and such derivatives have applications as dyes,6 fluorescence sensors,7 organic semiconducting molecules,5c ligands,8 to name a few. However, polycyclic hydrocarbons
have not been thoroughly explored with host–guest chemistry.9

Host–guest chemistry is known to
change the optical properties of organic molecules. Various host molecules
have been used, such as crown ether,10 calixarene,11 pillarene,12 and
cucurbit[n]uril.13 Among
these hosts, cucurbit[n]uril has the advantage of
high binding constants that are comparable to biological systems.
Cucurbit[n]uril is well known for stabilizing reactive
intermediates14 and redox states15 and its ability to increase fluorescence properties.16 Cucurbit[n]uril is a macrocyclic
molecule made of glycoluril and a methylene bridge17 (Figure 1). It is expressed as CB[n], where n is the number of methylene bridges in the molecule. For guests with
similar size, CB[7] forms a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry but becomes
2:1 for CB[8] because there is enough inner volume to accommodate
two guest molecules inside the CB[8].18

In this work, 2,8-diphenyl-N,N′-dimethyl-3,9-diazaperylenediium
dichloride (DAP) was synthesized, and its interaction with CB[n] (n = 7, 8), the resulting host–guest
complex, and supramolecular polymer are presented.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of DAP
A free DAP base was synthesized from commercially
available 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone and acetophenone based on a previously
reported method.19 The quaternization of
free base with methyl iodide followed by ion exchange afforded DAP
with chloride anions as a target compound (Figure 1). DAP has low solubility and undergoes aggregation
in aqueous and organic solvents.20 The
concentration-dependent 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic
resonance) shows that DAP primarily exists as aggregates with broadened
NMR signals at around 5.19 × 10–3 M and de-aggregates
forming well-resolved NMR signals at 6.54 × 10–4 M. (Figure S5).

Interaction
of DAP with CB[7]
It is well documented that CB[n] binds with neutral and cationic molecules by ion–dipole,
hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding interactions.13a DAP has three potential binding centers: the central core
and two aryl substituents. The mode and stoichiometry of the intercalation
between DAP and CB[n] are compelling for this study.

The interaction of CB[7] with DAP was monitored by 1H NMR (Figure 2).
With 2.86 × 10–3 M in D2O, DAP NMR
signals are broad. With the incremental addition of CB[7], upfield
and downfield shifts of NMR signals were noted. After the addition
of 2.92 mol equiv of CB[7], sharp signals were observed and adding
more CB[7] had no effect, which indicated that the complexation was
complete. The CB[n]-induced shielding and deshielding
effect of 1H NMR signals give structural information of
guest molecules inside the CB[n].21

Figure 2 Schematic representation of the interaction of DAP with CB[7] (top). 1H NMR titration of DAP (2.86 × 10–3 M in D2O) with incremental addition of CB[7] (bottom).

1H NMR titration shows that DAP exists
as aggregates in a free state with broadened NMR signals, and as CB[7]
is added, it breaks the aggregation and forms an intercalation complex
with CB[7].20

Closer inspection of
the 1H NMR titration revealed that the two aryl groups,
in a free state, produce one signal at 7.62 ppm. Following the addition
of 2.92 mol equiv of CB[7], the aryl signal not only resolved into
three signals but also showed the shielding effect of 0.54, 0.73,
and 0.87 ppm for ortho, meta, and para protons, respectively. The
same shielding effect of 0.60 ppm was also observed for the N-methyl group.

The signals for perylenediium core
protons of H1, H4, H5, and H6 were deshielded with a maximum effect
of 1.06 ppm for H6 and minimum of 0.15 ppm for H5, which indicate
that the protons are located outside of the CB[7] molecule. The magnitude
of deshielding and shielding suggests that H6 is located at the periphery
of CB[7] and interacts with the carbonyl group of CB7; whereas, the N–Me and aryl substituents are located inside the
hydrophobic cavity.

Even though DAP has three
potential binding regions, the central core and two aryl substituents,
CB[7] prefers to interact with aryl substituents against the central
core. To understand the mode of intercalation, a theoretical calculation
was performed. CB[7] and DAP were optimized with the DFT-B3LYP-6-316(d)
basis set. PM3-optimized host–guest complexes showed an energy
of −0.50 a.u for 2:1 (Figure 3) versus 0.10 a.u for the perylenediium core CB[7]
1:1 complex (Figure S4). These structures
show that CB[7] undergoes more significant distortion to accommodate
the perylenediium core than it does to accommodate the aryl group,
which indicates that CB[7] prefers to bind the terminal aryl substituents
rather than the central core for the perylenediium molecule.

CB[7] (1.0 × 10–4 M) in water at 25 °C
(left). PM3-optimized 2:1 complex of DAP–CB [7] (right).

The complexation of CB[7] with DAP was further
probed by ESI-MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) and isothermal
titration calorimetry. ESI-MS gives m/z = 1380.91 (expected m/z = 1380.94)
and m/z = 799.25 (expected m/z = 799.26) for 2:1 and 1:1 complexes, respectively (Figure S2). Isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) titration was carried out to calculate the binding constant
between DAP and CB[7]. The technique provides both the binding constant
and the contribution of thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy
and entropy on the binding interactions. The triplicate titrations
of DAP with CB[7] showed K1 = 1.67 ±
0.06 × 106 M–1, K2 = 1.07 ± 0.10 × 103 M–1, ΔH1 = −10.21 ± 0.06
kcal/mole, ΔH2 = −19.29 ±
1.30 kcal/mole, TΔS1 = −1.73 ± 0.06 kcal/mole, TΔS2 = −15.16 ± 1.31 kcal/mole as average
values. The magnitude of K2 is smaller
than K1, indicating that the formation
of the 2:1 complex is less favored than that of the 1:1 complex, which
can be explained by taking into consideration the entropy and enthalpy
components during the binding process. During the formation of the
2:1 complex, entropy decreases and is compensated by a decrease in
enthalpy, indicating that the process is entropically disfavored and
enthalpically favored. The decrease in entropy can be attributed to
the steric repulsion between the incoming CB[7] and the CB[7] of the
1:1 complex. The magnitude of these binding constants is within the
range of values reported for similar guest molecules. For example,
sanguinarine has K1 = 106 M–1 and K2 = 103 M–1 with CB[7].22

Interaction with CB[8]
The interaction of DAP with CB[8]
was monitored by 1H NMR titration (Figure 4). The incremental addition of CB[8] to DAP
(6.52 × 10–4 M) in D2O results in
a slow exchange, forming complexed and free DAP signals. As more CB[8]
was added and the molar ratio of DAP–CB[8] reached 1.0:2.0,
signals that correspond to free DAP disappeared and the appearance
of complexed DAP was noted. The 1H NMR signals of DAP–CB[8]
were assigned using 1H–1H COSY (correlation
spectroscopy) (Figure S13). 1H NMR titration reveals that N-Me and Ar-ortho,
Ar-meta, and Ar-para protons are shielded by 0.39 and 0.96, 0.76,
and 0.51 ppm respectively. Meanwhile, perylenediium core protons H1,
H4, H5, and H6 are deshielded with a maximum of 0.64 ppm for H6 and
a minimum of 0.21 ppm for H5. This titration shows that CB[8] binds
aryl substituents of DAP in the same manner as CB[7].

of interaction of DAP with CB[8] (top). 1H NMR titration
of DAP (6.52 × 10–4 M) with incremental addition
of CB[8] in D2O (bottom).

1H NMR titration of DAP with CB[8] not only showed the
effects of shielding and deshielding but also, upon closer inspection,
showed the broadening of DAP signals. After adding
2.48 equiv of CB[8], the DAP signals were broadened, which indicated
the formation of a supramolecular polymer.23

Characterization of DAP–CB[8] by ESI-MS demonstrates
the presence of 1:1 and 1:2 complexes, but there was no indication
of a supramolecular polymer or multicharged species (Figure S3). This may be due to the unstable nature of these
species under ESI-MS thermal conditions, which has been observed by
other researchers using similar systems.24

2D NMR Study of DAP, DAP–CB[7], and DAP–CB[8]
The presence of supramolecular polymer is supported by 2D NOESY (two-dimensional
nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) and DOSY spectra.24 The comparison of 2D NOESY spectra of DAP, DAP–CB[7],
and DAP–CB[8] clearly indicates that CB[8] has two molecules
of DAP inside the hydrophobic cavity.

2D NOESY of free DAP shows
cross peaks of N-Me-Ar, N-Me-H4,
H1-Ar, H5-H6, and H1-H6. The cross peak between Ar and N-Me shows that the aryl groups adopt a conformation in which they
are in close proximity to the N-Me groups (Figure 5 and Figure S8).

Figure 5 2D NOESY spectrum of DAP (1.58 ×
10–3 M) in D2O showing cross peaks between N-Me-H4 and N-Me-Ar (left). 2D NOESY spectrum
of DAP–CB[7] (1.18 × 10–3M with 2.41
mol equiv of CB[7]) showing cross peaks between N-Me-H4 (right).

2D NOESY of DAP–CB[7] retains
all cross peaks observed for free DAP except for the N-Me-Ar interaction. The absence of an N-Me-Ar cross
peak shows that aryl substituents undergo significant rotation to
accommodate the incoming CB[7] host, increasing the distance between
the aryl ortho protons and the N-Me. The corresponding
increase in the distance results in the disappearance of the cross
peaks in the 2D NOESY spectrum (Figure 5 and Figure S9).

The
2D NOESY spectrum of CB[8]–DAP showed the presence of long
range through the space interactions that are only feasible if DAPs
are in close proximity to each other. The N-Me group
interacts with Ho, Hm, H4, and H5; and aryl protons Ho and Hm interact with perylenium core
protons of H6, H1, H4, and H5 and form the cross peaks. These interactions
are not observed with the DAP–CB[7] complex. The presence of
these cross peaks shows that DAP molecules are located in close proximity
to one another inside the CB[8] and such species are not observed
in free DAP or with the DAP–CB[7] complex (Figure 6 and Figures S10 and S11).

spectrum of DAP–CB[8] (right) (C: 1H NMR for cucurbit[8]uril).
Both spectra are 2.36 × 10–3 M DAP with 2.8
mol equiv of CB[8].

Diffusion-ordered NMR
spectroscopy (DOSY) was used to characterize the interaction between
DAP and CB[n] (n = 7, 8). The DOSY
spectra of DAP–CB[8] (Figure 6), DAP–CB[7] (Figure S12), and free DAP (Figure S11) were recorded
in D2O. The diffusion coefficients are 1.37 × 10–9, 2.28 × 10–10, and 1.65 ×
10–10 m2s–1 for free
DAP, DAP–CB[7], and DAP–CB[8], respectively. The magnitude
of these diffusion coefficients indicates that the average molecular
weight increases from free DAP to DAP–CB[8], which further
supports the formation of a supramolecular polymer with DAP–CB[8].24 The diffusion coefficient for DAP–CB[8]
is comparable to similar polymer reported in literature. For example,
1.53 × 10–10 and 1.09 × 10–10 m2s–1 are the diffusion coefficients
for CB[8]-based functionalized naphthalene and stilbazolium25 polymer, respectively.

Conclusions
Water-soluble DAP was synthesized, and it exists as aggregates
at higher concentration and de-aggregates at low concentration in
water. The interaction of DAP as a guest was studied with two macrocyclic
hosts of CB[n] (n = 7, 8). DAP forms
a 1:2 complex with CB[7] as confirmed by NMR and ESI-MS and supported
by theoretical calculations. The interaction of DAP with CB[8], a
larger host, was studied by NMR and ESI-MS. 1H NMR shows
broadening of the DAP–CB[8] complex, indicating the formation
of supramolecular polymer and was supported by 2D NOESY and DOSY NMR
experiments. The 2D NOESY spectra confirmed the presence of long range
through the space interactions of DAP molecules, which supports the
presence of supramolecular polymer. 2D DOSY NMR experiments were used
to calculate diffusion coefficients, which decreased from DAP to DAP–CB[8],
further supporting the formation of species with higher molecular
weights. Future research efforts will focus on synthesizing unsymmetrical
donor–acceptor-substituted DAP and studying the redox activity
as a function of host–guest interactions.

Experimental Conditions
Synthesis
of DAP
Unmethylated DAP was synthesized based on a previously
reported method.19 Quaternization of free
base was done as follows: 0.10 g (2.46 × 10–4 mole) of free base was suspended with 3 mL of methyl iodide in nitromethane
(5 mL) and refluxed under an N2 atmosphere. After reacting
overnight, the solvent was removed by evaporation, and the resulting
solid was suspended in methanol and passed through Dowex ion exchange
resin. The product was purified by precipitating in acetonitrile with
diethyl ether to afford pure DAP (weight of DAP obtained: 0.08 g;
yield: 64%). The compound has low solubility in aqueous and organic
solvents, and it showed concentration-dependent aggregation (Figure S5), preventing the acquisition of 13C NMR. HRMS (ESI-TOF) m/z: Calcd for [C32H24N2]2+ 218.0964; found 218.0956. 1H NMR (400 MHz, deuterium
