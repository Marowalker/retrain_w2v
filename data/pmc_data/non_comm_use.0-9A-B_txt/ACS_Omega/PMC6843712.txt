Cerium oxide has constantly attracted
intense attention during
the past decade both in research and industry as an appealing catalyst
or a noninert support for catalysts, for instance, in the water-gas
shift reaction and hydrogenation of the ketone group. Herein, the
cerium oxide surface has been chosen to investigate the adsorption
and decomposition behaviors of the N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxdiimide
(EP-PTCDI) molecule by photoelectron spectroscopy. As expected, EP-PTCDI
molecules self-assemble on the cerium oxide surface comprising both
trivalent and tetravalent cerium at room temperature. Interestingly,
the EP-PTCDI molecule exhibits selective adsorption on cerium oxide
after the heating treatment. It was found that the ketone group of
EP-PTCDI first undergoes hydrogenation after annealing to 400 °C,
which is probably related to the fact that high temperature annealing
provides sufficient thermal energy to trigger the reaction between
the ketone group and trivalent cerium. Furthermore, EP-PTCDI molecules
are discovered to start to decompose hierarchically on the ceria substrate
from annealing at 400 °C due to the strong molecule–substrate
interaction and the effective catalysis by the trivalent cerium, whereas
the decomposition sequence of functional groups is revealed to be,
first, the ethyl propyl group (−C5H9),
followed by the hydrogenated ketone (alcohols) group. Finally, our
study may provide a new platform for the fundamental understanding
of complex organic reactions on the cerium oxide surface.

Introduction
Cerium oxide (CeOx) has become a ubiquitous
catalytic constituent in a wide range of applications such as photocatalysis,
water-gas shift reaction, thermochemical water splitting, and organic
reactions.1,2 For example, fuel cells with CeO2-based materials have almost entered into markets; meanwhile, ceria
emerges as a novel material for other catalytic reactions, holding
appealing promise for industrial applications in the future.3,4 Among these encouraging applications, one of the most attractive
properties of cerium is the controllably converted chemical states
between the trivalent (Ce(III)) and tetravalent (Ce(IV)) ceria, while
Ce(III) is mostly perceived to be the active site for catalysis.5 Because of such convenient conversion, cerium
or cerium-based structures can easily promote catalytic reaction by
gaining or losing one electron. It has been widely accepted that because
of the low redox potential between Ce(III) and Ce(IV), CeO2 usually dominates in the oxidative atmosphere, whereas in the reducing
circumstances, Ce2O3 becomes predominant: CeO2 ⇌ CeO2–x + x/2O2. Accordingly, the cerium oxides can either
provide oxygen for the oxidation or remove oxygen from the gas phase.
The amounts of oxygen reversibly provided in and removed from the
gas phase are called “oxygen storage capacities”.6 Consequently, under oxygen deficiency conditions
such as ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), ceria oxide can easily release oxygen
in the form of lattice oxygen, and oxygen vacancy is created accordingly.
Nevertheless, varying oxygen vacancies can be created under different
conditions which have already been reported experimentally before,
for example, single surface oxygen vacancy and single subsurface oxygen
vacancy are dominant when ceria is annealed at 900 °C for 1 min
under UHV, whereas linear surface oxygen vacancy clusters are dominant
when ceria is annealed at 900 °C with longer annealing under
UHV7 or other different annealing temperatures
under UHV.8 Moreover, ordered vacancy clusters
consisting of several oxygen vacancies were observed in the thin ceria
film on Cu(111) after annealing to 527 °C under UHV,9 whereas ordered oxygen vacancy was obtained in
one monolayer cerium film deposited on Rh(111) under an oxygen atmosphere
at 527 °C annealing.10 Encouragingly,
oxygen vacancies can reduce the potential barrier to facilitate on-surface
reactions and, therefore, have different implications. For instance,
the C–C coupling reaction is activated by oxygen vacancy dimers,11 the NO molecules can be converted into N2 via the catalysis of surface vacancies.12

In addition, oxygen vacancies have also been always
utilized together
with Ce(III) as the reaction center site. For example, cerium oxide
has been used as the catalyst for the water-gas shift reaction (CO
+ H2O → CO2 + H2), methanol
synthesis (CO2 + H2 → CH3OH),
and carbon monoxide oxidation (CO + O2 → CO2)13−15 with the transformation between the C=O and
C–O bonding during these reactions, which is considered to
be associated with the participation of Ce(III). Nevertheless, such
bonding conversion reported in literature occurs in the relatively
small molecules or groups, and it is not yet clear whether the C=O/C–O
bond from macromolecules with complex functions can be activated or
not by Ce(III). On the other hand, the exploiting of adsorption and
reaction mechanism of functional macrocycles/molecules on cerium oxide
surface is relatively limited. In order to investigate the catalytic
behavior of Ce(III) in complicated systems, herein, functionalized
perylene tetracarboxylic diimide, namely, N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxdiimide
(EP-PTCDI, C34H30N2O4)
has been chosen in this work, which comprises four C=O bonds
and is shown in Scheme 1. As reported, this kind of molecules belonging to the class of perylene
derivatives are versatile candidates toward organic optoelectronic
applications due to their electronic, optical, and charge-transport
properties,16,17 as well as the commercial availability
and low cost. In practice, decomposition of the EP-PTCDI molecule
has been explored on various substrates in literature reports, and
it was figured out that the ketone (C=O) group was directly
cleaved from the EP-PTCDI molecule,18,19 although the
underlying mechanism has not been addressed yet. Based on these considerations,
herein, we have comprehensively investigated the adsorption and decomposition
behaviors of EP-PTCDI on cerium oxide as a function of molecular coverage
and post-annealing temperature by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and valence band spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the interfacial
interaction between EP-PTCDI molecules and the ceria substrate is
related to molecular thickness. Furthermore, different parts in the
EP-PTCDI molecule such as the perylene backbone or functional groups
interact distinctly with the ceria substrate. Moreover, it has been
revealed that the ketone group was first hydrogenated before decomposition,
whereas the cracking of functional groups occurs at different elevated
temperatures in sequence.

Results and Discussion
As discussed before, cerium
oxide is a good oxygen storage material;
therefore, the cerium oxide foil might release oxygen under oxygen
deficiency conditions, such as UHV or high-temperature annealing,
tuning the oxidation state of ceria.20,21 Based on this
consideration, XPS measurements of the sputtered cerium oxide foil
are performed as a function of post-annealing temperatures which are
illustrated in Figure 1. First, it is found from Figure 1a that the Ce 3d spectrum is rather complicated, where
both tetravalent and trivalent components are observed. Surprisingly,
there are in total five pairs of Ce 3d components resolved after peak
fitting, of which three pairs belong to the tetravalent cerium and
two belong to the trivalent cerium.3 In
order to explain complex Ce 3d core level spectra, it has been proposed
that the ground state of CeO2 is in the mixed state of
4f0 and 4f1L–1 (L–1 denotes a hole in the valence band), and three pairs of peaks are
caused by screening effect of 4f electron with the O 2p orbital involved.4 Accordingly, final states of tetravalent cerium
are Ce3d94f0O2p6, Ce3d94f1O2p5, and Ce3d94f2O2p4. The paired components with the highest binding energy
(BE) located at 917.1 and 898.6 eV, labeled as U3 and V3 in the Ce 3d spectrum, are related to the Ce3d94f0O2p6 final state, which is characteristic
feature of the tetravalent cerium. Meanwhile, the paired components
located at 908.0/889.4 eV are assigned to the Ce3d94f1O2p5 final state marked with U2/V2, and the U/V paired peaks located at 901.5/883.1 eV are,
therefore, attributed to the Ce3d94f2O2p4 final state. Similarly, final states of trivalent cerium
are Ce3d94f1O2p6 and Ce3d94f2O2p5, in correspondence to the paired peaks
located at 904.5 and 886.3 eV (U1 and V1) and
the pairs located at 899.7 and 881.4 eV (U0 and V0).22,23 Herein, as revealed in Figure 1a for the foil after annealing
to 100 °C in UHV, the tetravalent Ce 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 splitting pairs are located at 917.1/898.6, 908.0/889.4,
and 901.5/883.1 eV of BE,23−25 while the trivalent Ce 3d splitting
components are positioned with the BE at 904.5/886.3 and 899.7/881.4
eV.23−25 The coexistence of both tetravalent and trivalent
cerium suggests the rich chemical states in the treated ceria foil
with appealing applications in the surface catalysis field.

Figure 1 Investigations
on the ceria foil as a function of post-annealing
temperatures in UHV. (a) Typical Ce 3d core levels recorded after
annealing to 100 and 460 °C as examples. Raw data and fitted
components are represented in different color; Ce(III) and Ce(IV)
states are labeled as V0, V1 and V, V2, V3, respectively. (b) Work function variations of the
cerium oxide foil as a function of post-annealing temperatures and
the ratio changes between the trivalent and tetravalent cerium atoms.
(c) Evolution of valence band structures of the ceria foil during
thermal annealing taken with photon energy of 1486.6 eV.

As the post-annealing temperature increases successively
from 100
to 550 °C, the evolution of the tetravalent and trivalent cerium
peaks has also been investigated and depicted in Figure 1b. For easy illustration, Ce
3d spectrum recorded at 100 and 460 °C annealing were selected
and depicted in Figure 2a as a typical example. It is apparent from the Ce 3d spectrum on
the top of Figure 1a that the tetravalent ceria has not completely transformed into
trivalent cerium after annealing at 460 °C, retaining the mixed
states comprising both trivalent and tetravalent ceria. However, the
ratio of the trivalent and tetravalent cerium is increasing almost
linearly as a function of annealing temperature according to the peak
fitting analysis, say, from the initial 0.59 at 100 °C annealing
to 1.22 after heated to 460 °C in UHV, as presented in Figure 1b, and the ratio
of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) continually rises with elevating annealing temperature,
which gets to 1.56 after heating to 550 °C. The rising proportion
of Ce(III) during annealing in UHV is probably induced by the reaction
between the residual H2 gas from the UHV chamber and the
ceria substrate, which partially transforms the Ce(IV) into Ce(III).
In addition, work function of the ceria foil after each heating treatment
was calculated by measuring the exact position of the secondary cutoff
in valence band spectroscopy, and the variation of work function is
summarized in Figure 1b as well. Interestingly, work function of the cerium oxide surface
increases from 3.8 eV at beginning to 5.4 eV in the end, while the
change is relatively big. At first sight, the increase of work function
might be related to the increase of trivalent cerium on surface after
thermal annealing: the more the trivalent cerium, the larger the work
function, while the increment of both the trivalent cerium and surface
work function is almost linear to the temperature elevation.

lines, while fitted components are displayed by colored solid curves.

It is known that the 4f orbital
of the trivalent cerium is partly
occupied, splitting into two bands: one occupied orbital and another
unoccupied orbital, whereas that of the tetravalent cerium is completely
unoccupied. Consequently, the appearance and variation of trivalent
cerium can be directly detected by monitoring the existence of occupied
4f orbital from the valence band structure.21,26 The monochromatic X-ray source (hν = 1486.6
eV) was utilized to measure valence band structures, as the typical
valence orbitals of heavy-metal elements is much more visible with
high-energy photons as compared to ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy.27−29 As expected, it is clear in Figure 1c that the intensity of the Ce 4f occupied state gradually
increases with elevating annealing temperature, indicating the increase
of the trivalent cerium. Additionally, we found a slight BE shift
of the Ce 4f occupied state to a lower position as the percentage
of trivalent cerium increases, that is, from 1.9 to 1.8 eV, which
might be related to the change of work function of the cerium oxide
substrate after annealing.

When EP-PTCDI was deposited on the
ceria foil, uniform adsorption
and growth of organic molecules can be recognized as judged from the
sequential measurements of the Ce 3d core level in Figure 2a. First, the ratio of Ce(III)/Ce(IV)
remains substantially during molecular deposition and adsorption.
As can be clearly seen, the ratio is 1.56 before adsorption, and varies
slightly with the increasing of molecular thickness, getting to the
final value of 1.53, as summarized in Figure 2b. Notably, no BE shift or shape evolution
is observed for all Ce 3d peaks regardless of molecular coverage,
which is not surprising as the Ce 3d spectrum is not only contributed
by atoms from the first cerium layer on surface but dominantly by
the subsurface cerium atoms. Evaluated from the exponential decay
of the Ce 3d peak intensity with respect to the organic film thickness,
the growth of EP-PTCDI can be assigned to a layer-by-layer mode.30 Based on this, the film thickness, thereafter,
can be approximately calculated from the intensity attenuation of
Ce 3d peaks, which are labeled in Figure 2a, starting from submonolayer (2.9 Å)
to multilayer (17.8 Å). It is seen from the molecular structure
that the EP-PTCDI molecule has four chemically different carbon atoms,
which are sp3 hybridized C (H–C–C), sp2 hybridized C, nitrogen-bounded C, and carbonyl C bound to
a nitrogen atom. As the sp2 and sp3 hybridized
carbon atoms are not easy to distinguish in conventional XPS by judging
the difference in BE, consequently, there is a relatively broad peak
resolved at 285.3 eV in Figure 2a at the molecular coverage of 2.9 Å.31 In addition, the second fitted component located at 289.0
eV can be attributed to the carbonyl carbon in the ketone (C=O)
group, whereas the component from the nitrogen-bounded C is assigned
to the peak at 286.8 eV. Besides, additional tiny features can also
be resolved at high BE, which are probably satellite related peaks.32 As the EP-PTCDI film thickness increases, peak
shift of the C 1s spectrum is apparent in Figure 2c. For example, the component from the ketone
group shifts toward lower BE from the initial position of 289.0 eV
to the final position of 288.6 eV with the coverage increased to 17.8
Å, whereas the BE of the nitrogen-bonded C peak moves from 286.8
to 286.5 eV. Similarly, peak shifting is also observed in the N 1s
spectra as illustrated in Figure 2d. Undoubtedly, one main N 1s peak located at 400.7
eV is resolved from the nitrogen atoms in the EP-PTCDI molecule. As
the thickness of organics rises, the N 1s peak moves to 400.8 eV at
the coverage of 3.7 Å, which continues to go up to 401.0 eV when
the coverage is about 8.3 Å. However, the N 1s peak position
remains at about 401.0 eV in the final thickness of 17.8 Å.

Nevertheless, charge transfer always occurs at the adsorption interface,
whereas the influence from interface gets ignorable or disappears
as the adsorption film becomes fairly thicker. The general shift of
C 1s and N 1s components toward high BE position as a function of
film thickness can, therefore, be ascribed to the interfacial dipole
effect.33 However, the shift of C 1s peaks
in the opposite direction toward lower BE, for instance, 0.4 eV for
the carbonyl carbon and 0.3 eV for nitrogen-bonded carbon, is fairly
interesting, which might indicate the can-not-be-ignored interaction
between the carbon atoms from functional groups and the cerium oxide
substrate, resulting in charge transfer from substrate to the carbon
atom. Meanwhile, it has been reported in previous studies that the
interaction between the backbone carbon atoms (sp2/sp3 hybridization) and substrate is relatively weak.32,34 Therefore, we can conclude that EP-PTCDI molecules in general are
weakly adsorbed on the cerium oxide surface with resolvable molecule–substrate
interaction.

To further exploit the adsorption stability of
the EP-PTCDI molecule
on the oxidized cerium substrate, a thin layer of EP-PTCDI adsorbed
on the ceria substrate (with coverage of around 4.0 Å) was treated
by post-annealing in sequence from 100 to 500 °C. It can be recognized
from the Ce 3d spectra that no obvious change was induced with annealing
below 300 °C except the decline of peak intensity due to molecular
desorption after thermal annealing. However, visible changes are found
in the Ce 3d spectrum when the annealing temperature reaches 300 °C.
First, the ratio of Ce(III)/Ce(IV) changes dramatically, as shown
in Figure 3b. The ratio
of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) atoms first goes up sharply to 6.5 at 300 °C
annealing, gradually drops slowly to 5.6 after annealing to 400 °C,
followed by a considerable decrease to about 3 when annealed at 500
°C. Interestingly, the characteristic tetravalent paired components
(Ce 3d5/2 and 3d3/2) originally positioned at
917.1 and 898.6 eV disappear after annealing to 300 °C, and recover
until 500 °C annealing. The disappearance of the paired components
does not say that the tetravalent cerium is completely gone because
the other two pairs of Ce(IV) component are still apparent. However,
the fine electronic structure of the tetravalent cerium has been apparently
modified within the annealing temperature range between 300 and 500
°C. As discussed, the paired 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks located at 917.1 and 898.6 eV are the typical features of
the tetravalent cerium embedded with the Ce3d94f0O2p6 orbital structure. Triggered by high-temperature
annealing, on-surface reaction of cerium oxide with the residual H2 from the UHV chamber might happen without too much difficulty
and the Ce3d94f0O2p6 hybridized orbital
can be changed into Ce3d94f1O2p6 by
gaining one electron, resulting in partial transformation from tetravalent
to trivalent cerium, which is in agreement with the observations on
the pristine CeOx substrate mentioned
earlier and the previous report of CO molecules reacted on CeOx.35,36 The drop of the proportion
of Ce(III) and the recovery of characteristic Ce(IV) ions at annealing
to 500 °C, may suggest the active involvement of Ce(III) in the
on-surface reaction between EP-PTCDI molecules and substrate.

heating treatment after molecular adsorption. (a) Evolution of Ce
3d core levels from 100 to 500 °C. (b) Ratio variation of Ce(III)/Ce(IV)
as a function of annealing temperature. (c) Changes of the C 1s spectra
during critical annealing steps. (d) Variation of the N 1s core levels
in sequential annealing.

Elaborate investigation of the C 1s spectra during annealing
might
provide more insight into the on-surface reaction mechanism. It is
discovered that the shape of C 1s core level signal is well preserved
during annealing until 300 °C. Interestingly, as seen in Figure 3c, the peak located
at 289.0 eV disappears after annealing to 400 °C, indicating
the vanishing of C=O double bonding. Meanwhile, the component
at 286.8 eV gets much stronger. As the N-bonded carbon cannot apparently
increase, the visible spectrum change at 286.8 eV can be assigned
to formation of the single C–O bond with the alcohols group,
which has a similar BE to the nitrogen-bounded carbon37 and is probably induced by the hydrogenation of the original
C=O bonding assisted by the catalysis of the trivalent cerium38 [Ce(III) is consequently converted into Ce(IV)
after hydrogenation], in agreement with the slight proportion drop
of Ce(III) after annealing to 400 °C. Furthermore, only the main
sp2/sp3 component is retained after annealing
to 500 °C, it is therefore expected that only the perylene backbone
of the EP-PTCDI molecule is left on the oxide surface. Besides changes
of C 1s spectra during step-by-step thermal annealing of the adsorption
complex, fascinating variations have also been revealed in N 1s core
level spectra. Similar to the C 1s spectra, no visible change among
the N 1s spectra is found when the annealing temperature is below
400 °C. However, as the annealing temperature is further increased
to 400 °C, a new peak appears at the BE of 399.3 eV in the N
1s spectrum, which shall be connected to the metal-bounded nitrogen.39 Therefore, we can infer that nitrogen atoms
strongly interact with the cerium atoms underneath, indicating that
the ethyl propyl (EP) functional group begins to disassociate from
the molecule with the C–N bonding broken, while the EP group
has not been completely detached as the original component from C–N
bonding still dominantly exists in the N 1s core level. Surprisingly,
the original carbon-bounded N peak is gone completely leaving only
the cerium-bonded peak, which strongly suggests that the EP group
is completely detached from the molecule as it is heated to 500 °C,
although the metal-connected nitrogen is still adsorbed on the substrate.

Based on these results, we can conclude the following. When thermal
annealing is promoted to 300 °C, it is found that the ratio of
trivalent to tetravalent cerium increases sharply from 2.8 to 6.5,
with the characteristic feature of Ce(IV) removal. At the same time,
no visible change of C 1s or N 1s has been witnessed yet. Subsequently,
once the annealing temperature gets to 400 °C, the cleavage of
the EP functional group is triggered with partial detachment, whereas
hydrogenation of the carbonyl group into the alcohols group happens
as well, both of which are expected to be assisted by the trivalent
ceria.13 Surprisingly, the proportion of
trivalent cerium was found to drop back when the annealing temperature
reaches 500 °C, which means the Ce(III) atoms greatly participate
in the on-surface reaction, for instance, cleavage of the alcohols
functional group. As known, Ce(III) is converted into Ce(IV) because
of the interaction between the residual nitrogen and cerium atoms
on the surface, as discovered in the N 1s spectrum in Figure 3d with the metal-bounded N.
Consequently, the ratio of Ce(III)/Ce(IV) returns to the initial value.
Interestingly, metal-bounded nitrogen atoms are robustly adsorbed
on the oxide surface after the decomposition of molecule, indicating
a strong N–Ce bonding/interaction, whereas only the perylene
backbone is left on surface. For easy illustration, the on-surface
adsorption and reaction mechanism of P-PTCDI on CeOx surface has been summarized in a cartoon diagram and presented
in Figure 4.

Conclusions
We
have comprehensively investigated the adsorption and on-surface
reaction of the EP-PTCDI molecule adsorbed on a ceria foil and demonstrated
the robust thermal stability of EP-PTCDI on the CeOx substrate. To start with, sole heating treatment was applied
to the CeOx foil to check the variation
of trivalent cerium, which is expected to be the active center for
catalysis. It was found that the proportion of trivalent cerium increases
together with the work function of the foil as a function of annealing
temperatures, implying the occurrence of on-surface reaction. Thereafter,
EP-PTCDI molecules are deposited onto the cerium oxide substrate kept
at room temperature, where weak molecule–substrate interaction
is revealed. Followed by sequential thermal annealing, it is surprisingly
discovered that the EP-PTCDI molecule is stably adsorbed on the CeOx foil until annealed to 400 °C, while
the ratio of Ce(III)/Ce(IV) increases sharply at annealing to 300
°C. Interestingly, the EP group starts to detach from molecules
and the carbonyl group undergoes hydrogenation by the catalysis of
the trivalent cerium after 400 °C heating. As expected, the interaction
between functional groups and cerium is much stronger than that between
the perylene backbone and substrate. As the annealing temperature
rises to 500 °C, it is inferred that the perylene backbone is
left on the surface, which might be further transformed into other
carbon-based species via cross linking, together with the Ce-bounded
nitrogen atoms detached from EP-PTCDI. In the end, our report provides
new insights toward the explicit understanding of surface/interface
reactions in the CeOx system widely utilized
in catalysis.

Experimental Methods
XPS measurements
were carried out with a SPECS PHOIBOS 100 spectrometer
using a monochromatic Al Kα source (hν
= 1486.6 eV). The base pressure in the vacuum chamber was maintained
better than 1.0 × 10–9 mbar throughout the
whole measurement. Work function of the analyzer was calibrated to
give the Au 4f7/2 core level a BE of 84.1 eV. High-resolution
spectra were obtained by choosing a 3 × 7 mm2 spot
size and the pass energy of 10 eV, resulting in the full width at
half maximum of 0.2 eV in the Au 4f7/2 spectrum.

The cerium foil was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with a purity
of 99.9%, while the oxidized cerium was obtained by gradual oxidation
in air on purpose. Before loading into the UHV chamber, it was first
polished in alcohol with fine sandpaper followed by ultrasonic cleaning
for 20 min in ethanol and acetone, respectively. In order to remove
surface impurity and contamination, the oxide foil was further cleaned
by argon sputtering in the UHV chamber with an ion energy of 1.0 k
eV for 8 h, and the cleanness of the foil was checked by XPS. Interestingly,
there is a very tiny and negligible carbon impurity with the peak
position located at 285.4 eV, which cannot be completely removed from
the surface, and is most probably related to the intrinsic impurity
from the ceria bulk. Deposition of EP-PTCDI molecules was carried
out in situ in the XPS chamber, and the coverage was monitored by
a quartz microbalance and double checked by evaluating the intensity
attenuation of Ce 3d peak in core level spectra. Post-annealing of
the ceria foil was performed in sequence with each step having the
duration of half an hour.

XPS peaks were fitted afterwards utilizing
the XPSPEAK software.
During the fitting process, the Lorentzian–Gaussian ratio of
paired peaks was kept at a constant value, the same as that for the
peak area; for example, the peak intensity ratio of Ce 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 components is set to 1.5 according to the spin-orbital
splitting of Ce 3d. In addition, difference in peak positions of paired
peaks was also kept to a fixed value in accordance with the XPS database.40,41 Afterwards, proportions of chemically different cerium atoms can
be precisely evaluated by comparing the peak area of the trivalent
and tetravalent cerium.42,43
