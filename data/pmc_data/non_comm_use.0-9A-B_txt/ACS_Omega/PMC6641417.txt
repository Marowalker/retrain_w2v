The green fluorescence emission of 9-aminoanthracence (9AA) was maintained
by controlling the oxidation of 9AA with oxygen in the
solid state and in solution. The solid-state fluorescence of 9AA was maintained for a longer time when lauric acid was
used because the equilibrium between 9AA and 9-anthrylammonium
salt (9AAH+) inclines toward
the right-hand side in the presence of an acid. A solution of 9AA in CDCl3, to which nitrogen had been bubbled
through for 5 min, continued to emit green fluorescence for more than
3 days, whereas the fluorescence emission disappeared within 3 days
for the solution that had been bubbled with oxygen for 5 min. 9AA is oxidized by oxygen in MeOH under dark conditions to
give almost nongreen fluorescent anthraquinone monoimine (AQNH), whereas dimerization of 9AA occurs under UV irradiation
at 365 nm, much faster than the generation of AQNH. These
results suggest that 9AA is oxidized by the triplet rather
than the singlet oxygen in MeOH. Some of the organic molecules, proteins,
and biological tissues were successfully stained with 9AA on microscope slides within 10 min because the green fluorescence
emission of 9AA was successfully maintained in the presence
of an acid and under hypoxic conditions of the used materials.

Introduction
Bioimaging
fluorescent probes featuring xanthene, dipyrromethene, and porphyrin
have been developed to visualize biomolecules like proteins, DNA,
carbohydrate chains, and phospholipids in cells and tissues.1−3 Rhodamine and fluorescein are molecules featuring a xanthene skeleton
that have been widely used as organic fluorescent probes because they
can be synthesized in a few steps from the corresponding starting
materials, emit strong fluorescence, and can be easily modified to
give many biochemically usable derivatives by introduction of suitable
substituents into the parent skeletons.1,4 Fluorescent
compounds are functionalized by modifying the mother skeleton to work
as specific pH, metal ion, and oxygen sensors.5−8 Sensors are characterized by reversible
or irreversible structural changes in response to variations in the
surrounding environment.

9-Aminoanthracene (9AA), synthesized from 9-nitroanthracene
in moderate yield, is expected to play an important role as a fluorescent
probe, similar to fluorescein4 and green
fluorescence protein9 because it emits
green fluorescence.10,11 Polymers constructed with 1-amino
and 9AA units are also found to emit green fluorescence
similar to their monomers,12 whose absorption
spectra have been compared to those of 2-aminoanthracenes.13,14

However, owing to its auto-oxidation, functionalization of 9AA has been limited to N-substitution, which
reduces the reactivity of the nitrogen atom. Auto-oxidation of 9AA, which involves its decomposition in air to give anthraquinone
(AQ) through anthraquinone monoimine (AQNH),14 is classified as an irreversible
process, whereas hemoglobin and hemocyanin oxidations are known to
act through reversible auto-oxidation processes.15 The mechanism of auto-oxidation is not yet fully understood
because it is not known whether singlet or triplet oxygen is the operative
species; however, the structural change from 9AA to AQNH can be used as an oxygen sensor.

In this study,
we describe how the fluorescence emission of 9AA is retained
in the solid state and in solution by controlling
its auto-oxidation because the extinction of fluorescence is linked
to the structural change from 9AA to AQNH.16 Moreover, we report its application
as a bioimaging reagent to successfully stain organic compounds, proteins,
and rat organ tissues on microscope slides.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Fluorescence Properties
9AA was obtained
in 69% yield with >99% purity by reduction of 9-nitroanthracene 1, which was prepared in two steps from anthracene via 9-chloro-10-nitro-9,10-dihydroanthracene,
with a slurry of SnCl2 and conc. HCl in acetic acid under
thermal conditions.10,11 A solution of 9AA in CHCl3 was treated with conc. HCl at 0 °C to give
9-anthrylammonium chloride (9AAH+·Cl–) as a pale
red solid in 84% yield (Scheme 1). A solution of 9AA in MeOH exhibited an absorption
band at λmax = 420 nm, which is similar to the reported
values in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and CH3CN.17 The fluorescence emission of 9AA in MeOH was observed at λmax = 510 nm with a quantum
yield of 19%, which was similar (20%) to that of 9AAH+·Cl– in MeOH.a The excitation and fluorescence
spectra of 9AAH+·Cl– observed in DMSO and MeOH have the
same spectral profile and maxima as those of 9AA, whereas
the fluorescence intensity of 9AAH+·Cl– is lower
than that of 9AA (see Supporting Information, Figures S-1 and S-2), thus indicating that 9AAH+·Cl– emits green fluorescence owing to its equilibrium
in solution with 9AA.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 9AA and 9AAH+·Cl–
Fluorescence Spectra in the Solid State on a Thin-Layer Chromatography
(TLC) Plate
Solid-state fluorescence spectroscopy of 9AA was carried out on a TLC plate coated with silica gel.
The TLC plate loaded with 9AA was irradiated with excitation
light of 420 nm, and the fluorescence spectra were measured in the
range of 450–700 nm. The fluorescence intensity was monitored
at λmax = 507 nm. The fluorescence emission of 9AA was recorded within the first 5 min after loading the
TLC plate with 9AA. It was noted that the second scan,
recorded after 15 min, did not display enough intense fluorescence
owing to auto-oxidation of 9AA at ambient atmosphere.
On the other hand, upon loading a 10 mg/mL solution of lauric acid
in MeOH on the TLC plate, using a capillary, and superimposing a 10
mg/mL solution of 9AA in MeOH, fluorescence emission
at λmax = 510 nm was detected after 19 min of TLC
plate preparation, and then the fluorescence intensity gradually increased
and maximized after ca. 10 h (584 min) even if the TLC plate was exposed
to air. These results indicate that the emission can be maintained
on the TLC plate in the presence of lauric acid (Figure 1). Fluorescence emission was
not maintained when lauric acid was replaced by tetradecanol and laurylamine
(see Figures S-3–S-5). Each fluorescence
spectrum of 9AA in the presence of lauric acid, tetradecanol,
or laurylamine finally converged to that of AQNH. The
continuous fluorescence emission under acidic conditions on the TLC
plate indicates that the equilibrium between 9AA and
9-anthrylammonium salt (9AAH+) inclined toward the right-hand side, resulting in a slower auto-oxidation
of 9AA and a reproducible fluorescence emission of 9AA (Scheme 2).

presence of lauric acid.

Scheme 2 Equilibrium between 9AA and 9AAH+ and Auto-Oxidation of 9AA
Monitoring the Conversion
of 9AA to AQNH in Solution by 1H NMR Spectroscopy
To investigate
the relationship between the auto-oxidation18−22 and the green fluorescence emission of 9AA, its conversion to AQNH was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy as a CDCl3 solution under a nitrogen
or oxygen atmosphere. A solution of 9AA in CDCl3 was stable in an NMR tube for 16, 24, and 72 h after bubbling nitrogen
for 5 min (Figure 2). Oxidation of 9AA by oxygen started after bubbling
oxygen for 5 min, and some amounts of AQNH were already
formed after 1.5 h, together with trace amounts of AQ, which is the hydrolysis product of AQNH. The oxidation
gradually proceeded, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy
at 16 and 24 h, and almost all 9AA had disappeared after
72 h. Green fluorescence emission of 9AA was observed
over 72 h for the solution under a nitrogen atmosphere; on the other
hand, it slowly decreased after bubbling oxygen and disappeared after
72 h. These results indicated that the extinction of green fluorescence
emission of 9AA is linked to its oxidation by oxygen,
that is, auto-oxidation.

Figure 2 Monitoring of 1H NMR spectra of 9AA in
CDCl3 under nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres.

Monitoring Dimerization versus Oxidation
in Solution by 1H NMR Spectroscopy
During an attempt
to recrystallize 9AA from MeOH, dimer 2 was
obtained as a colorless
crystal instead of 9AA, together with AQNH and AQ. This dimer was also observed in the NMR tube
while monitoring a sample of 9AA in MeOH-d4 under sunlight by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 3). Therefore, we
investigated the relationship between the oxidation and dimerization
processes of 9AA to determine the influence of oxygen
and light irradiation. Thus, the irradiation of a degassed solution
of 9AA in MeOH-d4 in a sealed
tube with light at 365 nm was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy
(Figure 3). After 1
h of irradiation, dimer 2 was detected and after 3 h,
a single crystal precipitated owing to its low solubility in MeOH-d4. The bimolecular reaction of 9AA to form dimer 2 proceeds via a [4 + 4] cycloaddition
at the 9- and 10-positions of the anthracene skeleton and requires
light irradiation because bimolecular thermal [4 + 4] cycloaddition
of 9AA is forbidden according to the Woodward–Hoffmann
rule. X-ray crystallographic analysis shows that the dimer forms hydrogen
bonds between its NH2 groups and the OH group of MeOH to
form the corresponding 1:2 complex in the single crystal (see Figures S-6 and S-7). The dimer was also identified
by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which displayed signals due to
a benzene ring (two doublets and two triplets) and a methine proton
(singlet) derived from the proton at the 10-position of 9AA. The identified structure in MeOH-d4 solution was in good agreement with that analyzed by X-ray crystallographic
analysis. AQNH was also detected, but the ratio between
the dimer and AQNH was different in each run even under
the same conditions, and the amount of AQNH did not increase
in the degassed and sealed NMR tube even under light irradiation.
Almost all of dimer 2 was isolated from a solution of
the reaction mixture in MeOH by deposition, resulting in a 1H NMR spectrum with only signals assigned to 9AA and AQNH. To confirm the influence of light toward the oxidation
of 9AA, a nondegassed and nonsealed solution of 9AA in MeOH-d4 was irradiated
at 365 nm for 3 h (Figure 4). Formation of AQNH and 2 were
detected after 1 h by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and the signals
assigned to the products gradually increased after 3 h. However, oxidation
of 9AA proceeded to give AQNH when the reaction
mixture in the NMR tube was kept in the dark and oxygen was bubbled
through for 5 min. These results ascertain that the formation of dimer 2 requires light irradiation, whereas AQNH is
formed by oxidation with oxygen. Triplet oxygen was assumed to be
the reacting species because the oxidation occurred in the dark. However,
this is inconsistent with a previous report describing how anthracene
and its derivatives react with singlet oxygen under UV irradiation,
giving AQs through decomposition of the intermediate
endoperoxides.23−28 Therefore, the above reaction was conducted in the presence of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(DABCO), which is known to inhibit singlet oxygen oxidations (see Figure S-8).29,30 In air, a
solution of 9AA in MeOH was oxidized in the presence
of DABCO at a rate similar to that in the absence of DABCO, indicating
that singlet oxygen is not the oxidative species. Next, the reaction
was carried out in the presence of ethanolamine, which is commonly
used as an antioxidizing reagent in material sciences (see Figure S-9).31 Unexpectedly,
the oxidation in the presence of ethanolamine proceeded faster than
that in its absence, probably because the solubility of oxygen increases
in the presence of ethanolamine in MeOH.b These
results indicate that 9AA is oxidized by triplet oxygen
and that the reaction rate is dependent on the solubility of oxygen
in the solvent.

Scheme 3 Auto-Oxidation and Dimerization of 9AA
Staining of Organic Compounds
and Proteins with 9AA
We considered that if we could retain
the green fluorescence of 9AA under acidic conditions
in the solid state and avoid the
extinction of the fluorescence by the oxidation with oxygen, then 9AA could be used as a bioimaging reagent. At first, a solution
of 9AA in MeOH was sprayed onto organic compounds and
proteins on microscope slides, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Organic compounds and proteins stained with 9AA. The
horizontally arrayed pictures are the dried materials on the microscope
slides of (1) lauric acid, (2) tetradecanol, (3) laurylamine, (4)
triphenylphosphine (Ph3P), (5) glucose, (6) bovine serum
albumin (BSA), (7) histone, and (8) casein. Times of fluorescence
measurements are displayed at the top. All bright fields were observed
with 1/2000 s exposure time. For comparison of fluorescence intensity,
exposure times, labeled on the pictures, were varied depending on
the fluorescence intensity of the materials, which is constant over
all observation times for each material. Bright-field views before
and 18 h after staining are omitted for clarity. Scale = 100 μm.

Figure 5-1 shows
the fluorescence of 9AA at 0 and 10 min and 18 h after
spraying lauric acid with a MeOH solution of 9AA on the
microscope slide. Lauric acid dissolves in the solution after spraying,
and then its mixture with 9AA crystallizes by evaporation
of MeOH on the microscope slide under an ambient atmosphere. Green
fluorescence emission of the mixture was observed at an exposure time
of 1/4 s, within 10 min of the microscope observation, and even after
18 h. Fluorescence emission was also observed for the sprayed samples
of tetradecanol, laurylamine, Ph3P, and glucose (Figure 5-2–5). However,
the intensity of the lauric acid-sprayed sample was stronger than
that of the tetradecanol- and glucose-sprayed samples, which can be
rationalized from the equilibrium between 9AA and 9AAH+ under acidic conditions, as
mentioned earlier. On the other hand, the intensity of the fluorescence
emission was stronger for the laurylamine- and Ph3P-sprayed
samples than that for the lauric acid-sprayed sample. This result
can be justified because amines, except for the abovementioned ethanolamine,
create a hypoxic state more readily than acids, and Ph3P is considered to be a hypoxic material due to its high reactivity
with oxygen to form triphenylphosphine oxide; thus, the degradation
by oxidation of 9AA to AQNH is slower.32,33 Fluorescence emission was observed after 18 h, although with a much
weaker intensity than that after 10 min because of the eventual oxidation
of 9AA on the microscope slide at ambient atmosphere.

Proteins like BSA, histone, and casein sprayed with a solution
of 9AA in MeOH produced strong fluorescence emission
even after 18 h (Figure 5-6–8). Molecular weights of BSA, casein, and histone are 66,
15, and 25 kDa, respectively, which are about 100 times larger than
organic compounds, and contain acidic, neutral, and basic moieties.
The acid/base character of proteins depends on the difference in the
number of carboxyl and amino groups in those proteins. The strong
fluorescence emission observed for each protein is rationalized by
the conversion of 9AA to 9AAH+ under acidic conditions and the robustness of 9AA in hypoxic conditions created by the amino groups of the
proteins.

Staining of the Digestive Tract with 9AA
Because 9AA retained green fluorescence for a longer period on pure
organic compounds and proteins, we expected similar behavior on animal
tissues. Therefore, we stained tissues of adult rat digestive tract
organs by simply spraying a MeOH solution of 9AA (Figure 6). These organs are
formed of four common constituent tissues composed of various types
of cells, mucosa (Mc), which is the innermost layer of the gut wall
and faces the gut lumen and processes food; submucosa (Sm), which
lies underneath the Mc and contains blood and lymphatic vessels, glands,
and nerve networks, which regulate the gut wall movements through
smooth muscles; muscularis (Ms), which consist of smooth muscle cells;
and serosa, which is the outermost thin layer of the gut wall and
holds the digestive tract.34,35 Owing to the structural
characteristics of these organs, they are suitable for determining
whether 9AA is able to attach to various cells or not.
The studied tissues emitted almost no green fluorescence before staining.
Only the jejunum and ileum showed slight signals, assigned to the
autofluorescence from vegetable foods contained in the gut lumen.
Immediately after the staining processes, which took about 10 min,
all tissues of the stomach, jejunum, ileum, and colon were intensely
green fluorescent under blue excitation light. This is based on the
fact that the fluorescence emission takes place in all areas of the
stomach, jejunum, ileum, and colon tissues on the plate, whereas it
does not emit in their absence. All of the studied tissues, which
were stored in air, emitted weak but obvious fluorescence 18 h after
staining.

Conclusions
We
have described two methods to retain fluorescence emission of 9AA in the solid state and in solution by controlling the
auto-oxidation of 9AA. Thus, 9AA was preserved
on a TLC plate by a coexisting acid and in solution under a low concentration
of oxygen. Organic compounds, proteins, and tissues of upper and lower
digestive tracts were successfully stained with 9AA within
10 min of application and without any treatment after staining; the
stained organic compounds, proteins, and tissues emitted green fluorescence
even after 18 h. These results indicate that 9AA can
be used as a bioimaging reagent and oxygen sensor in a simple procedure.
At present, digestive tract organs are among the top five origins
of newly developed malignant tumors in humans, and such malignancies
are the leading cause of death of cancer patients worldwide.36 The present study indicates that 9AA is effective as a rapid bioimaging reagent at least in the diagnoses
or treatments of the organ-derived cancers of these organs. In this
respect, it is necessary to evaluate whether 9AA staining
is an alternative method to the standard hematoxylin and eosin (HE)
staining, which is generally used in histopathological analysis. Synthesis
of 9AA derivatives and comparison between 9AA staining and other staining methods, like HE staining,c are currently in progress.

Observation of Fluorescence Spectra
Fluorescence spectra
of 9AA in the presence of lauric acid, tetradecanol,
and laurylamine on silica gel 60F254 TLC aluminum sheets
(1 cm × 4 cm) in a nonfluorescence-four-faced quartz cell with
a 1 cm light-path length were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5300PC fluorospectrometer.
The lower part of the TLC sheets were first loaded with 10 mg/mL solutions
of lauric acid, tetradecanol, and laurylamine in MeOH followed by
the loading of 10 mg/mL 9AA in MeOH. The first scan of
the fluorescence spectrum, in the range of 430–700 nm, was
obtained at a scan rate of 2 nm/s by light at an excitation wavelength
of 420 nm. After measuring the first scan, the excitation shutter
was closed. The second and following scans were performed after the
shutter was reopened. The fluorescence spectra were recorded in the
same region and at the same scan rate as the first scan.

Monitoring
the Dimerization and Oxidation of 9AA by 1H NMR Spectroscopy
First, the 1H NMR spectrum
of a solution of 9AA in MeOH-d4 (0.75 mL) was recorded in an NMR tube with
a J Young valve. The NMR tube was irradiated with UV light at 365
nm for 3 h. 1H NMR spectra were recorded after 1 and 3
h. The solution was then kept in a steel dewar in the dark for 48
h by surrounding the NMR tube with aluminum foil. 1H NMR
spectra were recorded after 24 and 48 h. Afterward, oxygen was bubbled
into the solution for 5 min through a capillary glass, and the solution
was left to stand in the dark for another 72 h. 1H NMR
spectra were recorded after 24, 48, and 72 h.(1) A solution of 9AA (4.13
mg, 21.4 μmol) in MeOH-d4 was degassed
by the freeze–pump–thaw method.

(2) A solution of 9AA (4.20
mg, 21.8 μmol) in MeOH-d4 was used
without the freezing and degassing treatment.



Staining of Organic Compounds, Proteins, and Tissues with 9AA
Solutions of organic compounds (lauric acid,
tetradecanol, laurylamine, Ph3P, and glucose) in MeOH and
proteins (BSA, histone, and casein) in water were placed on microscope
slides with the aid of a capillary. The organ tissues (stomach, jejunum,
ileum, and colon) were prepared on microscope slides after cutting
the paraffin-embedded organs extirpated from rats as follows.

Rats were anesthetized and sacrificed by bleeding from the axillary
vein for tissue preparations. Excised tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate-buffered saline on ice and dehydrated in graded ethanol
series (70–100%), cleared in xylene at room temperature and
embedded in paraffin wax. Paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into
serial sections and mounted onto slides. After deparaffinization in
Clear Plus (FALMA, Tokyo, Japan) and rehydration, the tissues were
dried in air. Staining was performed by spraying a solution of 9AA (1.0 × 10–3 mM) in MeOH, prepared
in a 10 mL spraying bottle, onto dried tissues. The sprayed samples
were left until the residual MeOH had completely evaporated. All rat
studies were performed according to the guidance issued by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Kitasato University.

Bright
areas were observed under the microscope in natural light,
and green-fluorescent areas were recorded through a 460–495
nm filter by exciting at 420 nm. Each recording was performed before
and from 10 min to 18 h after staining the organic compounds (lauric
acid, tetradecanol, laurylamine, Ph3P, and glucose), proteins
(BSA, histone, and casein), and the organ tissue sections (stomach,
jejunum, ileum, and colon) of a rat.

a Fluorescence quantum
yields of 9AA and 9AAH+·Cl– were measured as the
absolute values.

b We measured
the relative oxygen concentration
in 5.0 mL of H2O and in 4.5 mL of H2O and 0.5
mL of MeOH in the presence and absence of ethanolamine. Oxygen concentrations
in H2O in the presence of ethanolamine (37 mg, 0.61 mmol)
and (74 mg, 1.2 mmol) were determined to be 99 and 100% toward the
reference value (100%) in H2O. Oxygen concentrations in
H2O−MeOH solution in the presence of ethanolamine
(24 mg, 0.39 mmol) and (48 mg, 0.79 mmol) were determined to be 96
and 93% as the reference value (100%) in H2O−MeOH
solution. Oxygen concentration in H2O after N2 bubbling for 5 min was determined to be 9% as the reference value
(100%) in H2O.

c Microscope observation could be conducted
within 10 min after staining a tissue with 9AA, whereas
it needed 1 h after staining a tissue by the HE stain because excess
of HE had to be removed by washing with EtOH.37,38
