In
the present study, chitosan poly(methacrylate) composites were
prepared and applied for adsorption of bromocresol green from aqueous
solutions. The synthesized composites were characterized with scanning
electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and
thermogravimetric analysis. The bromocresol green removal by the developed
adsorbent was investigated, and the effects of experimental parameters,
including sample pH and adsorption time, were also examined. Furthermore,
the adsorption characteristics of the synthesized adsorbent, including
kinetics, adsorption isotherms, and thermodynamics, were comprehensively
studied. The adsorption isotherm was well described by the Freundlich
model, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 39.84 μg mg–1 by shaking for 40 min at pH 2.0. Bromocresol green
adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model,
indicating that adsorption was the rate-limiting step. Thermodynamic
parameters and the negative values of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) showed that adsorption was a spontaneous process.
The positive values of entropy change (ΔS°)
implied that the adsorption of bromocresol green on chitosan poly(methacrylate)
composites was an increasing random process. In addition, enthalpy
change (ΔH°) values were positive, suggesting
that the adsorption of bromocresol green was endothermic. The adsorption
percentage of bromocresol green with chitosan poly(methacrylate) composites
remained above 97% after three times of recycling test.

1 Introduction
Bromocresol green (BCG)
(2,6-dibromo-4-[7-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-phenyl)-9,9-dioxo-8-oxa-9λ6-thiabicyclo[4.3.0]nona-1,3,5-trien-7-yl]-3-methyl-phenol)
belongs to the triphenylmethane family dyes that is used as a pH indicator
and as a tracking dye for DNA agarose gel electrophoresis.1 It is more stable, and its biodegradation is
more difficult because of complex aromatic molecular structures.2,3 Furthermore, it has an impact on the aquatic life and food web even
in low concentrations. Many of the industrial dyes disturb both the
environment and living beings and have even proved as cancer-causing
substances.4−6 Therefore, removing them from aqueous solutions is
of great interest. It is for this reason that analytical methods have
been developed, such as liquid–liquid extraction,7 membrane separation,8 solid-phase microextraction,9 catalysis,10,11 and adsorption,2,4,12,13 and so forth. Adsorption methods based on
application of efficient adsorbent are extensively employed.12,14,15 A variety of materials such as
activated carbon,1,16 zeolite,17 imprinted materials,18 inorganic materials,19,20 sorption resins,21 and polymers22,23 have been reported for adsorption of dyes in this technique. Nonetheless,
researchers are attracted toward finding new materials to develop
novel adsorbents.

Of the above-mentioned materials, polymers
have been widely used
in many fields because of their abundant recognition sites, high loading
capacity, and easy modification.21 In particular,
they are used as adsorbents for adsorption of various organic substances
due to their advantages of low cost, good regeneration ability, and
easy recyclability.22 However, the defects
of swelling and shrinkage lead to weak mechanical stability when polymers
are exposed to different organic solvents.23 Recently, new polymer materials have been designed by modification
with inorganic materials that have specific chemical properties, high
surface-to-volume ratio, strong mechanical stability, high regenerability,
and so on.24

Chitosan, a linear polysaccharide
composed of randomly distributed
β-(1–4)-linked d-glucosamine (deacetylated unit)
and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (acetylated unit),
is made from chitin. It is an ideal polymer and possesses special
characteristics such as nontoxicity, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility,
biodegradability, adsorption properties, and so on.25 Chitosan carries a large number of −OH and −NH2 groups, which is suitable for the formation of hydrogen bonds.
When it is combined with polymer as cross-linking agent, the prepared
composites can be used in the environment and in other fields. For
instance, Kang et al. prepared hydrogels adsorbent with exfoliated
montmorillonite nanosheets and chitosan for removing Methylene Blue
from water.26 Wang et al. successfully
prepared magnetic composites Fe3O4@SiO2@CS-TETA-GO and applied it for the fast adsorption of Methylene Blue
and Cu(II).20

In this work, chitosan
poly(methacrylate) composite was prepared
and characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) to identify the structures and morphology. The obtained adsorbent
was used for adsorption of bromocresol green from aqueous solutions
with ultraviolet–visible spectrometry. pH value and adsorption
time were investigated in the experiment. The adsorption experimental
data were studied based on isotherm and kinetic models (Langmuir/Freundlich
and pseudo-first-order/pseudo-second-order models). Thermodynamic
parameters, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°), and entropy
change (ΔS°) were obtained. The results
were analyzed to get sufficient knowledge of the mechanism, isotherm,
kinetics, and thermodynamics of the adsorption process.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemicals and Instruments
BCG, chitosan,
glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA), α-methacrylic
acid (MAA), cyclohexanol, dodecanol, and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN)
were purchased from Macklin Reagent (Shanghai, China). Methanol, sodium
dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4), sodium hydrogen
phosphate (Na2HPO4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH),
hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and acetone were obtained from Jiangsu
Qiangsheng Chemical Co., Ltd. (Changshu, China). The properties of
BCG are shown in Table 1. All other reagents were obtained from various commercial sources
and were of analytical or HPLC grade.

Table 1 Properties
of BCG
A CARY100 ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrophotometer
(Agilent Technologies Inc.) was used for the spectrophotometric analysis.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded on an S-3400N
analyzer (JEOL Company, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra were performed using an IR200 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Corporation).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Q500 apparatus
(TA) from 30 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under air atmosphere. A B11-2 magnetic stirrer (Shanghai
Sile Instrument Co. Ltd, China) was applied to mix the reaction solutions.
An H1650-W centrifuge (Hunan Xiangyi, China) was used for centrifuging.
A pHS-3E digital pH meter (Shanghai INESA Electron Co. Ltd., China)
was used for pH measurements of sample solutions.

2.2 Preparation of Chitosan Poly(methacrylate)
Composites
The prepolymerization solution containing monomer
(1.13 mmol GMA + 0.46 mmol MAA), cross-linker (0.62 mmol EDMA), porogen
(8.99 mmol cyclohexanol + 0.54 mmol dodecanol), and initiator (0.024
mmol AIBN) was degassed by ultrasonication for about 30 min. The obtained
homogeneous solution was initiated at 55 °C for 24 h to synthesize
poly(MAA-GMA-EDMA) composite. Then, chitosan (1% w/v in 1% acetic
acid) was added to the above-prepared composite, and this mixture
was reacted at 65 °C for 4 h.27 After
the reaction is complete, chitosan poly(methacrylate) composites (poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT)
were obtained and washed with methanol. The product was dried in an
oven at 50 °C and kept in a desiccator for further use. The preparation
process of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT.

2.3 Adsorption Experiments
The stock
solutions of BCG were prepared in double-distilled water, and the
UV–vis absorption wavelength of BCG was 614 nm.

To study
the adsorption of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT toward BCG, a series of 5.0
mL of standard solutions were prepared and adjusted to pH values (1.0–10.0)
with appropriate buffer solutions. Then, 10.0 mg of the poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
was added to the standard solution and the mixture was shaken vigorously
for 40 min to facilitate adsorption of the BCG onto the poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT.
The adsorption percentage of BCG was calculated according to eq 1 1  where C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations
of BCG (μg mL–1), respectively.

For
the equilibrium study and construction of the adsorption isotherm
of BCG by poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT, a series of concentrations of 5.0,
10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, and 100.0
μg mL–1 BCG standard solutions were prepared
as above, adjusted to the optimum pH 2.0, and individually mixed with
10.0 mg of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT. The mixtures were mechanically
shaken for 40 min at room temperature, and the adsorption capacity
at equilibrium for BCG by poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT was calculated using eq 2 2  where m corresponds to the
mass of adsorbent in (mg), V is the volume of solution
in (mL), and Qe is the adsorption capacity
at equilibrium (μg mg–1).

For the kinetic
study, based on the effect of adsorption time on
the BCG adsorption by poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT, it was studied at different
periods of time: 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min,
under the same batch conditions using 5.0 μg mL–1 BCG at a pH value of 2.0, and individually mixed with 10.0 mg of
poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characteristics of Poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
Figure 2 shows the
SEM image of the fractured surface of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT. As can
be seen in the figure, poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT has a homogeneous and
multiple-pore integral structure, which provided sufficient void volume
and sufficient active sites.28 Addition
of chitosan as a modifier to change the chemical or physical characteristics
of polymer due to its −NH2 and −OH groups
can avoid the shrinkage and cracking of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT in
the preparation process.29

Figure 2 SEM image of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT.

FTIR spectra of chitosan and poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
are illustrated
in Figure 3. In the
spectrum of chitosan, the peak at 1028 cm–1 was
due to the C–O streching of glucosamine ring30 and the peak at 1545 cm–1 was ascribed
to the N–H bending of amino group. The broad signal ranging
from 3200 to 3450 cm–1 comes from the O–H
stretching or N–H in primary amines,31,32 and it weakens in poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT, which could be attributed
to the interaction between epoxy group of GMA and primary amines of
chitosan. Poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT showed bands at 1730 and 1640 cm–1 corresponding to C=O and C=C bonds.
The chitosan present in the structure of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT could
be ascribed to O–H and/or N–H bonds (3400 cm–1) and C–H bonds (2880 cm–1) in the related
FTIR spectrum.33 Accordingly, it was concluded
that chitosan successfully bonded to the poly(methacrylate) composite.

Figure 3 FT-IR
spectra of chitosan and poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT.

TGA curve of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT indicated a three-stage
process
as shown in Figure 4. The first weight loss of about 5% existed in the temperature range
of 30–100 °C because of the evaporation of water and the
decomposition of labile oxygen. The second weight loss of 14% starting
near 180 °C could be attributed to the thermal degradation of
chemically bonded chitosan groups. The third weight loss of 76% in
the temperature range of 360–450 °C might be due to the
decomposition of monolithic material. The TGA curve tended to be constant
when the temperature was higher than 450 °C, indicating a complete
decomposition of the poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT materials.

3.2 Effects
of Sample pH
Sample pH has
important influence on the nature and surface properties of the adsorbent
and ionization/dissociation of the adsorbate molecule. The effect
of sample pH on the adsorption of BCG was investigated in the range
of 1.0–10.0. Figure 5 shows that the adsorption percentage of BCG decreased when
pH was increased from 1.0 to 2.0 and decreased when pH was decreased
from 2.0 to 10.0.34 At pH = 1.0, due to
excess of protons, the charges of BCG (anionic dye) and poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
were positive, and the electrostatic attraction was less compared
to that at pH = 2.0.1 At pH = 2.0, the
electrostatic attraction favored the adsorption of BCG onto the poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
surface due to the decrease of positive charge of BCG. Lower adsorption
was expected at pH > 2.0 due to the electrostatic repulsion between
BCG and anionic surface of adsorbent.35,36 Therefore,
pH = 2.0 was selected as an optimum parameter.

Figure 5 Effect of sample pH on
the adsorption of BCG onto poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
(dosage of adsorbent: 10 mg, concentration of BCG: 5 μg mL–1).

3.3 Effect
of Adsorption Time
The effect
of adsorption time is one of the essential key factors for studying
the kinetics of the adsorption process. The percentage adsorption
of BCG by poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT was investigated at different adsorption
times ranging from 2 to 120 min. Studies were conducted using a mechanical
shaker (10.0 mg of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT, 5.0 mL of 5.0 μg
mL–1 BCG, at a pH of 2.0), and the results were
calculated and are presented in Figure 6. It is clear from the figure that the adsorption percentage
of BCG increased considerably until the adsorption time reached 40
min; 90.9% adsorption was achieved after 2 min, and observably increased
to 98.5% after 40 min, until the maximum adsorption of 99.0% was reached
after 120 min. It could also be noted that the equilibration was not
linear, which may be due to the saturation of binding sites of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
with BCG at the specified adsorption time. No further increase in
the adsorption percentage was observed beyond 40 min of adsorption
time. A contact time of 40 min was selected for all of the equilibrium
tests.

(dosage of adsorbent: 10 mg, concentration of BCG: 5 μg mL–1, pH 2.0).

3.4 Adsorption Kinetics
Adsorption kinetics
is important for better understanding the adsorption mechanism, which
is expressed as the adsorbate removal rate that controls the residence
time of the adsorbate in the solid–solution interface.37 To investigate the adsorption kinetics of BCG
with the adsorbents, the adsorption data were analyzed using two kinetic
models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order). The linear forms
are shown in eqs 3 and 4(4,15) 3   4  where qt and qe are the amounts of BCG adsorbed at time t and at
equilibrium (μg mg–1),
respectively; k1 is the rate constant
of the pseudo-first-order models (min–1); and k2 is the rate constant of the pseudo-second-order
models (mg μg–1 min–1).

The kinetic parameters obtained from eqs 3 and 4 are shown in Table 2. The comparison made
between the experimental adsorption capacity (qexp) values and the calculated adsorption capacity (qcal) values showed that qcal values were very close to qexp values for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. However, the qcal values obtained from the pseudo-first-order
kinetic model were different from the qexp values. Moreover, the plot of pseudo-first-order kinetic model did
not converge well and did not give a straight line (R2 = 0.719). Figure 7 shows that the experimental data fit the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model, which suggests that the description of the adsorption
of BCG by poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT from aqueous solution can be well
described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.19

Figure 7 Pseudo-second-order kinetic model plots for the adsorption of BCG
onto poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT (dosage of adsorbent: 10 mg, concentration
of BCG: 5 μg mL–1, pH 2.0).

3.5 Adsorption Isotherms
Isotherm studies
are also undertaken to simulate the BCG adsorption by poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT.
The two most frequently used isotherms are the Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms.14,38

The Langmuir isotherm assumes
that monolayer adsorption can occur on the surface of the adsorbent.
The adsorption saturates, and no further adsorption can occur.39 The expression for the Langmuir isotherm is 5  where qe and Ce are the adsorption capacity (μg mg–1) and the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate
(μg mL–1), respectively; qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbents (μg
mg–1); and b is a constant (mL
μg–1). The slope and intercept of the linear
plot of Ce/qe versus Ce yied the values qmax and b, respectively.

The equilibrium
parameter (RL) was
used to evaluate the fundamental characteristics and practicability
of the Langmuir isotherm. 6  where C0 is the
highest initial concentration of BCG (μg mL–1) and b is the Langmuir constant. The value of RL indicates the shape of the isotherm as follows: RL > 1 (unfavorable), RL = 1 (linear), and 0 < RL <
1 (favorable).15,39

The Freundlich isotherm
is considered as model multilayer adsorption
which occurs on a heterogeneous surface with uniform energy. It can
be described as 7  

where k and n are the Freundlich
constants, which represent the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent
and the energy of adsorption, respectively. These values can be obtained
from the intercept and slope of the linear plot of log(qe) versus log(Ce).

The
adsorption isotherms were fitted with Langmuir and Freundlich
adsorption equations. The parameters are summarized in Table 3. The R2 values obtained from both models also fit well with the Freundlich
model. The 1/n value of 0.5686 obtained from the
Freundlich isotherm indicated a moderate multilayer adsorption intensity
of BCG over the heterogeneous surface of poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT.

3.6 Thermodynamic Studies
To understand
the influence of temperature on BCG adsorption with poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT,
Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy
change (ΔH°), and entropy change (ΔS°) were obtained by using the following equations37 8   9   10  where Kd is the
equilibrium constant, R is the ideal gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1), T is the temperature (K), and ΔH° and ΔS° were calculated from the
slopes and intercepts of eq 10.

Figure 8 shows that the adsorption capacity of BCG onto poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
increased with increase of temperature from 293.15 to 313.15 K. The
thermodynamic parameters calculated are listed in Table 4. The negative values of ΔG° indicate that adsorption was a spontaneous process.
The positive values of ΔS° imply that
the adsorption of BCG on poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT was an increasing
random process. In addition, ΔH° values
were positive, suggesting that the adsorption of BCG onto poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
was endothermic.

(dosage of adsorbent: 10 mg, concentration of BCG: 5 μg mL–1, adsorption time: 40 min, pH 2.0).

3.7 Comparison of Poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT Performance
with the Other Adsorbents
In Table 5, the maximum adsorption capacity of BCG
with poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT has been compared to that of other absorbents.
In addition, Table 6 shows a comparison of the kinetic and isotherm model constants for
BCG adsorption with other absorbents. It can be seen that poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
has a relatively large adsorption capacity and short contact time
for BCG, which is attributed to the composites structures and surface
properties. The results showed that poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT can be
considered as a very effective adsorbent for the removal of BCG dyes.

3.8 Regeneration of Adsorbent
Regeneration
of adsorbent for repeated reuse is one of the most important factors
for performance evaluations. After the adsorption process is complete,
the loaded poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT was sequentially treated with NaOH
(0.1 mol L–1) and deionized water. Through these
simple processes, the adsorbed BCG was washed out and poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
was regenerated. The adsorption percentage of BCG with poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
remained above 97% after three times of recycling test (99.6% for n = 1, 99.0% for n = 2, and 97.9% for n = 3). Results of the recovery tests indicated that poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
can be employed as a kind of recyclable adsorbents for the adsorption
of BCG.

4 Conclusions
In the
present study, poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT was prepared and employed
for adsorption of BCG from aqueous solution. Effects of pH and adsorption
time were studied in batch experiments. Kinetics, adsorption isotherms,
and thermodynamics were also examined. The kinetics study revealed
that adsorption rate was high and fit a pseudo-second-order kinetic
model. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for BCG onto poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
were studied, and it was demonstrated that the Freundlich model fit
the adsorption data better. Thermodynamic parameters suggested that
the adsorption process was a spontaneous and endothermic one. Compared
to other absorbents, poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT has a relatively large
adsorption capacity (39.84 μg mg–1) and short
contact time (40 min) for BCG. Furthermore, poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
was sequentially treated with NaOH (0.1 mol L–1)
and deionized water for the goal of regeneration. The adsorption percentage
of BCG with poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT remained above 97% after three
times of recycling test. Because of the high adsorption capacity,
short equilibrium time, and easy recycling, poly(GMA-MAA-EDMA)-CHT
has a potential for the adsorption of BCG in solutions.
