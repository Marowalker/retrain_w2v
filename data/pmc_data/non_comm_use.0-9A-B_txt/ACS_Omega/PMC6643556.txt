A new family of iodoplumbates
based on phosphonium cations have
been synthesized and characterized via X-ray crystallography. Thermogravimetric
analysis demonstrates that these materials have a remarkably high
thermal stability and show potential for applications as organic–inorganic
hybrid semiconductors. We also present the synthesis of three novel
phosphonium salts and the crystallographic elucidation of these compounds.

Introduction
In
the past two decades, lead(II) iodide–organic hybrids
(iodoplumbates) have emerged as promising materials for a myriad of
applications ranging from photovoltaics and nonlinear optics to semiconductors
and dielectric materials.1 This great diversity
of applications is a consequence of their variable and interesting
optical and electronic properties. The topology of the anionic lead(II)
iodide component (which largely determines the electronic and optical
properties) is controlled by the packing of the cationic organic components.1,2 Typically, small cations like methylammonium and formamidinium yield
three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, which make useful light-harvesting
materials.1,3 Larger polycationic organic components give
rise to two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) iodoplumbate
networks,4,5 which can exhibit interesting optical properties
(e.g., efficient photoluminescence,6 nonlinear
optics) or magnetic properties,7 respectively.
Nitrogen-centered organic cations are components in most examples
of iodoplumbate materials, with there being only a few examples containing
phosphorus-centered organic cations.8 Thus,
we present a few novel examples of phosphonium-templated iodoplumbates
that contain an extended network of PbI3– fragments with the potential of being semiconducting materials.

Monophosphonium-Templated
Iodoplumbates
Group 14 iodometalates have demonstrated the
ability to form perovskitic
structures of the formula ABI3, where “A”
is a monocation and “BI3” is a monoanion.3 Historically, the A cation site is occupied by
a larger alkali metal such as Rb or Cs2,9,10 or an alkylammonium.11−14 These cations render 3D perovskite
structures because of their smaller size. When a larger cation is
used, a 2D- or 1D- perovskitic structure is observed with possible
formulae of the general form ABI3, A2BI4, and A3BI5.13−17 Given that different-sized alkylammonium cations
produce different dimensionalities of anion connectivity, and in light
of the interesting structures obtained with trimethyl sulfonium cations,17 we sought to elucidate the structures obtained
using alkyl- and arylphosphonium cations. Tetramethylphosphonium,
tri(n-butyl)phosphonium, and methyltriphenylphosphonium
iodide salts were used to react with lead(II) iodide in the hope of
obtaining distorted perovskitic structures.

Two of the monophosphonium
iodide salts used were synthesized specifically
for these reactions. Tetramethylphosphonium iodide has been prepared
before;18 however, it was not crystallographically
characterized. We isolated colorless crystals of tetramethylphosphonium
iodide and performed single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure 1). The P–C bond lengths
in tetramethylphosphonium iodide of 1.761(7) Å are comparable
to those in the analogous tetramethylphosphonium fluoride salt,19 which has P–C bond lengths averaging
at 1.778(13) Å. The bond angles in the cation at 109.5(3)°
are similar to those previously reported,19 indicating that the methyl groups are tetrahedrally arranged in
the phosphonium cation. Furthermore, we report a cleaner, more facile,
and higher-yielding synthesis for this salt, which consists of adding
iodomethane to trimethylphosphine in toluene at room temperature and
stirring the mixture for 24 h. The reported method to produce this
salt is considerably less convenient:18 calcium phosphide and iodomethane are mixed in a methanol–water
solution at 0 °C for 3 h, and then, the mixture is heated to
boiling for 48 h. The volatiles are then removed in vacuo and the
resulting residue is mixed with ethanol and heated to boiling, hot-filtered,
exposed again to reduced pressure, and then the residue is recrystallized
from anhydrous ethanol. Not only is the reported synthesis lengthy,
NMR spectroscopy of the resultant material identifies the presence
of three other byproduct phosphonium cations,18 whereas the NMR spectrum of our synthesis contains only the target
phosphonium. Lastly, our synthesis has a 78% yield, whereas the other
method18 reports a 53% yield.

Figure 1 Tetramethylphosphonium
iodide ([PMe4][PbI3]).

Tri-(n-butyl)phosphonium iodide
was also synthesized
for the first time via addition of hydroiodic acid to a solution of
tri(n-butyl)phosphine in toluene. Although no crystals
suitable for X-ray diffraction were isolated, NMR and elemental analysis
are consistent with the synthesis of this new phosphonium salt. The 1H NMR chemical shift that arises from the proton directly
attached to the phosphorus atom occurs at 7.40 ppm as a doublet of
septets and is clearly indicative of the protonation of tri(n-butyl)phosphine.

Crystals of the reactions of the
three monophosphonium ions of
varying substituent size with lead(II) iodide were obtained using
two different methods. For tetramethylphosphonium, the starting materials
were combined in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and heated at 120 °C
to remove the solvent. After 2 days, mustard-yellow crystals suitable
for X-ray diffraction were collected ([PMe4][PbI3]). Alternatively, crystals for the reaction of lead(II)
iodide with tri(n-butyl)phosphonium ([PH(n-butyl)3][PbI3]) and methyltriphenylphosphonium
iodide ([PPh3Me][PbI3]) were obtained
by slow evaporation from acetonitrile (Figure 2).

From left: tetramethyphosphonium
iodide [PMe4][I], tri-(n-butyl)phosphonium
iodide [PH(n-butyl)3][I], and methyltriphenylphosphonium
iodide [PPh3Me][I].

NMR data revealed that the phosphonium cations persisted
in the
product mixture. Interestingly, the single-crystal X-ray diffraction
data of the monophosphonium-lead iodide reactions did not yield traditional
perovskites of the form ABI3, but provided instead an extended
1D network of PbI3– fragments in which
each lead atom has an octahedral geometry and the resultant octahedra
are linked to each other in a face-sharing fashion. A Cambridge structural
database (CSD) search indicated that the P–C bond lengths and
angles in the cations are typical of those reported in other phosphoniums,
ranging from 1.781 to 1.793 Å and 108.97(10) to 109.5(2)°,
respectively. The bond lengths of the PbI3– fragments in the 1D network range from 3.1379(4) to 3.398(3) Å,
which is similar to the iodoplumbate networks that have been previously
reported.4,5,11,14,16,17,20 The bond angles in this network
deviate from those observed in a perfectly octahedral network. The
trans I–Pb–I bond angles in this 1D network average
175.37(4)°, with the range being 165.87(11) to 180.00(12)°.
Consequently, the bond angles of cis iodine atoms in the molecule
have an average of 90.96(3)° with the minimum at 81.93(3)°
and the maximum at 96.90(2)°. It is not surprising that the bond
angles deviate from the ideal, since [PbI3–]∞ networks that have previously been reported
feature trans-molecule and cis bond angles of less than 180°
and greater or less than 90°, respectively (Figures 3, 4, and 5).4,5,14,17,20−22

Diphosphonium-Templated
Iodoplumbates
Given that the monophosphonium cations generated
an interesting
1D face-sharing octahedral structure, we synthesized a diphosphonium
cation to probe the effect of a dication in the reaction with lead
iodide. A novel diphosphonium iodide salt, bis(trimethylphosphonio)ethane
iodide, was synthesized by adding iodomethane to bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane
(Dmpe) in toluene. Bis(trimethylphosphonio)ethane iodide was then
dissolved in DMSO with lead iodide, which produced a yellow solution,
and evaporation of the DMSO yielded pale yellow crystals ([P2C8H22][Pb2I6]). NMR spectroscopy revealed that the phosphonium ions persisted
in the product and single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed an extended
1D face-sharing network of octahedral PbI3– fragments charge-balanced with the diphosphonium in the same manner
as the monophosphonium-templated iodoplumbates (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Bis(trimethylphosphonio)ethane
iodide.

The average P–C bond length
is 1.792(12)Å, which is
typical of other P–C bond lengths in phosphonium ions in the
CSD. Furthermore, the C–P–C bond angles average at 109.6(9)°,
indicating a tetrahedral coordination environment around the phosphorus
atoms. As for the 1D iodoplumbate network, the average Pb–I
bond length is 3.219(4) Å, which is in agreement with our monophosphonium
iodoplumbate networks and with those reported previously.4,5,14,17,20−24 The I–Pb–I bond angles are close to
that of the ideal for an octahedral network, with the angle between
cis iodide ions averaging at 90.0(10)°, the minimum angle being
83.644(12)°, and the maximum angle being 96.356(12)°. The
angles between trans iodide ions were all 180.0(0)° (Figure 7).

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC)
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to assess
the thermal
stability of the phosphonium iodoplumbates and the results are outlined in Figure 8. We observed that the mono- and diphosphonium with methyl substituents
afforded the best stability at higher temperatures, with [PMe4][PbI3] having no significant mass loss
up to 400 °C and [P2C8H22][Pb2I6] having lost approximately 8%
of its original mass. Conversely, the phosphoniums with longer alkyl
and aryl substituents showed decomposition and significant mass loss
at much lower temperatures. The TGA curves for [PH(n-butyl)3][PbI3] and [PPh3Me][PbI3] display two events, with the first occurring at approximately
129 °C, which can be attributed to evaporation of the residual
toluene used to prepare the starting material. The second event at
approximately 300 °C for [PH(n-butyl)3][PbI3] and 325 °C for [PPh3Me][PbI3] represents a significant mass loss due to decomposition
of the product, with [PH(n-butyl)3][PbI3] losing approximately 25% of its original mass and [PPh3Me][PbI3] losing 34% of its original
mass.

Figure 8 TGA curves of phosphonium-templated iodoplumbates.

Importantly, the TGA curves of
our phosphonium-templated iodoplumbates
show that they have a much greater thermal stability in comparison
with the previously reported amide-templated iodoplumbates. Conversely,
the transition metal-templated iodoplumbates decompose at approximately
270 °C,7 which is just below the decomposition
temperature of our compounds. Most notably, the phosphonium-templated
iodoplumbates’ decomposition pattern resembles that of the
methylammonium-PbI3– perovskite, which
initiates decomposition after 300 °C.3 Both the phosphonium-templated iodoplumbates and the methylammonium-PbI3– perovskite display a one-step decomposition,
which likely corresponds to the loss of the organic cation and iodide
content. These similarities between perovskites and our compounds
with respect to thermal stability point toward a potential for making
functional organic–inorganic hybrid materials from phosphonium-templated
iodoplumbates.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses
were performed
on each of the samples over the temperature range of 25–225
°C. The experiments revealed no unanticipated phase transitions
for any of the materials: de-solvation events were observed for systems
containing solvents of crystallization, and melting and crystallization
points were observed only for [PPh3Me][PbI3].

Conclusions
This work has demonstrated that phosphonium-templated
iodoplumbates
can be synthesized via direct addition of a phosphonium salt to lead(II) iodide in solution. The
materials have been crystallographically characterized, revealing
an extended network of anionic lead iodide fragments charge-balanced
with phosphonium cations. Thermogravimetric analysis indicates that
these compounds exhibit remarkable thermal stability. Study of these
materials as potential high-temperature semiconductors is currently
underway.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
All manipulations
were carried out
using standard inert atmosphere techniques. All chemicals and reagents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, except for tri(n-butyl)phosphine, which was purchased from Strem Chemicals, and used
without further purification. Deuterated solvents were dried according
to literature procedures when necessary, and all other solvents were
dried over a series of Grubbs’-type columns and degassed prior
to use. NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker
Avance III 500 MHz, Bruker Avance Ultrashield 300 MHz, or Bruker Avance
DPX 300 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative
to internal standards for 1H and 13C (the given
deuterated solvent) and the external standard for 31P (85%
H3PO4). Coupling constants |J| are given in Hertz. Elemental analysis was performed by the University
of Windsor Mass Spectrometry Service Laboratory using a PerkinElmer
2400 combustion CHN analyzer. UV–vis absorption spectra were
recorded on a Varian Cary 50 Conc UV–vis spectrophotometer.
All samples were dissolved in DMSO and run in a quartz cuvette with
a path length of 1 cm. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted on
a Mettler Toledo TGA SDTA 851e. Helium (99.99%) was used to purge
the system at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. Samples were held at 25 °C
for 30 min before being heated to 400 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min.
All samples were run in aluminum crucibles. Calorimetric studies were
performed on Mettler Toledo DSC 822e.

X-ray Crystallography
Crystals for investigation were
covered in Paratone, mounted into a goniometer head, and then rapidly
cooled under a stream of cold N2 of the low-temperature
apparatus (Oxford Cryostream) attached to the diffractometer. Data
were then collected using the APEXII software suite25 on a Bruker Photon 100 CMOS diffractometer using a graphite
monochromator with Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) or Cu Kα
(λ = 1.54178 Å) radiation. For each sample, data were collected
at low temperature. The APEXII software was used for data reductions
and SADABS26 was used for absorption corrections
(multiscan; semiempirical from equivalents). XPREP was used to determine
the space group, and the structures were solved and refined using
the SHELX27 software suite as implemented
in the WinGX28 or OLEX229 program suites. Validation of the structures was conducted
using PLATON.30
