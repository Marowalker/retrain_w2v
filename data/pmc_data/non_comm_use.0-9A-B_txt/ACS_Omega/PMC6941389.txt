A ZnO sol–gel precursor (ZnOPr) and graphene nanoplatelets
(GnPs) are mixed into a composite ink for inkjet printing photodetectors
with bulk heterojunctions of ZnO/GnP on a heated SiO2/Si
substrate. Heating of the SiO2/Si wafers at ∼50
°C was found optimal to prevent segregated droplets on the hydrophobic
surface of the SiO2/Si substrate during printing. After
printing the ZnO/GnP channels, thermal annealing at 350 °C for
2 h was performed for crystallization of ZnO and formation of the
ZnO/GnP heterojunctions. The GnP concentration was varied from 0,
5, 20, and 30 mM to evaluate optimal formation of the ZnO/GnP bulk
heterojunction nanocomposites based on ultraviolet photoresponse performance.
The best performance was observed at the 20 mM GnP concentration with
the photoresponsivity reaching 2.2 A/W at an incident ultraviolet
power of 2.2 μW and a 5 V bias. This photoresponsivity is an
order of magnitude better than the previously reported counterparts,
including 0.13 mA/W for dropcasted ZnO-graphite composites and much
higher than 0.5 A/W for aerosol printed ZnO. The improved performance
is attributed to the ZnO/GnP bulk heterojunctions with improved interfaces
that enable efficient exciton dissociation and the charge transport.
The developed inkjet printing of sol–gel composite inks approach
can be scalable and low cost for practical applications.

Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO) and graphene, especially
their nanohybrids, have
been extensively studied for a wide variety of applications ranging
from photodetectors,1−11 gas sensors,12,13 and stress/strain sensors.10,14−16 The appeal of ZnO and graphene for these applications
is that ZnO is a wide direct bandgap (3.4 eV) material, piezoelectric,
biocompatible, and inexpensive, while graphene has high charge mobility,
transparent, environmentally stable, and chemically inert.17−20 Nanohybrids of ZnO and graphene are typically fabricated by predepositing
graphene first via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and then incorporating
the ZnO on the top through hydrothermal growth,21,22 sputtering,8 atomic layer deposition
(ALD),23 spin-coating sol–gel precursors,3 electrochemical deposition,24 vapor transport,20 and dropcasting
prefabricated ZnO nanostructures.4 However,
synthesis methods such as CVD require high temperatures and a controlled
gaseous environment and other methods such as sputtering and ALD require
expensive high-vacuum systems.8,19,23 In addition, these methods deposit a film everywhere and require
additional steps of advanced lithography to define the active channels
for devices.

Inkjet printing provides a unique approach to deposit
functional
materials directly to a select region without a direct contact with
the substrate. In particular, inkjet printing of nanocomposites of
ZnO and graphite nanocomposites is appealing for flexible photodetectors25 and stress/strain sensors.26 Compared to other inkjet-printed ZnO devices, which commonly
have photoresponsivity on an order of ∼10–3 A/W,25,27,28 the inkjet-printed
ZnO/graphene nanocomposites, such as composites consisting of presynthesized
ZnO mixed with graphene flakes, have enhanced photoresponsivity on
an order of ∼10–2 A/W and rise and fall times
of ∼0.1 s.4,29,30 The ZnO/graphene composite devices can have above two orders of
magnitude improvement in photoresponsivity; however, they still lack
a poor interface between prefabricated ZnO and graphene structures.4,13,27 One way to resolve this issue
is to use a nanocomposite ink by mixing a ZnO precursor and graphene
nanoplatelets to allow a clean ZnO/graphene interface to form during
the ZnO crystallization while graphene is maintained intact. To do
this, the challenges in inkjet printing due to the effect of the substrate
surface hydrophobicity and ink fluidity on the morphology of the printed
films must be addressed. For example, in recent works by our group,
heat-assisted printing was explored on the hydrophobicity of SiO2. It has been found that the formation of large droplets can
be suppressed with moderate heating of the substrates to ∼50
°C for printing while also keeping the nozzle near the surface
to form a liquid bridge for capillary action-assisted printing to
avoid spraying that is prevalent in printing highly fluid inks.31,32 In addition, the composite ink has to satisfy specific requirements
to be considered printable. These requirements are known as the Reynolds,
Weber, and Ohnesorge numbers, which are defined as the following NR= vρa/η, NW= ρav2/γ, and NO= (NW)1/2/NR= η/(γρa)1/2, where γ, η, ρ, a, and v are the surface tension, dynamic
velocity, drop diameter, and velocity, respectively.33,34 Together, these numbers give rise to the “Z” parameter, which is defined as the inverse Ohnesorge number, Z = 1/NO, and should be in a
range of 1–10 for printability, too small or too large of a Z value will give a very viscous or too fluid ink, respectively.33,34 This indicates the importance in controlling the ink fluidity characteristic
for printability, especially for nanocomposite inks.

In this
work, graphene nanoplatelets (GnP) were incorporated in
a ZnO precursor (ZnOPr) solution to make a nanocomposite ink (ZnOPrGnP)
for printing ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors consisting of a network
of bulk heterojunctions of ZnO/GnP formed during post crystallization
of ZnO. The GnP concentration was varied from 0 to 30 mM in the ZnO
precursor to define an optimal ink for inkjet printing of a ZnO/GnP
network structure for photodetection. At an optimal GnP concentration
of 20 mM, the UV photoresponsivity reached up to 2.2 A/W and the on/off
ratio reached up to 102–10.3 This is four orders of magnitude higher in photoresponsivity than
the previously reported inkjet-printed ZnO/graphene nanocomposite
UV photodetectors4 and one order of magnitude
larger than an inkjet-printed flexible ZnO UV photoconductor.27 This improved responsivity can be ascribed to
the introduction of the ZnO/GnP heterojunctions for more efficient
exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the ZnO/GnP interface.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a illustrates
schematically the inkjet printing of the ZnOPrGnP nanocomposite ink
onto the SiO2/Si channel between two Au electrodes at a
substrate temperature of 50 °C. With assistance of the piezoelectric
vibration in the boron/silicate glass nozzle, the ZnOPrGnP nanocomposite
ink was dispersed from the nozzle to form a ZnOPrGnP precursor film.
Afterward, the annealing was performed to convert the ZnO precursor
to the polycrystalline ZnO/GnP composite film. It should be noted
that GnPs remain intact during the ZnO annealing process, which is
consistent to our previous works using graphene made in chemical vapor
deposition.3,21 By keeping GnPs intact during
the annealing, the embedded GnPs can form Schottky junctions with
crystalline ZnO at the ZnO/GnP interface.6,7,9,10,19 Specifically, the Schottky junction at the ZnO/GnP
interface is formed due to the charge transfer from ZnO to graphene,
which is induced by the energy work function offset of ZnO (qχ
= 4.4 eV) and graphene (qφm = 4.6 eV).35 As a result, the Fermi energy of the graphene
(ZnO) is increased (decreased), resulting in band bending near the
interface and an energy barrier (qφB = 0.2 eV) formation
between the graphene and ZnO (Figure 1b).35 Alternatively, this
same mechanism can also be used as a method for trapping charges on
the ZnO/GnP Schottky interface, which can reduce charge carrier concentration
in ZnO as shown in Figure 1c. This gives the ZnO/GnP nanocomposites several advantages
over the ZnO only photoconductive photodetectors.25,27 First, the dark current of the device is greatly reduced by introduction
of the Schottky junctions created at the graphene ZnO/GnP interfaces.
In addition, the ZnO/GnP Schottky junctions can facilitate exciton
dissociation into free electrons and holes and therefore increase
the photocurrent Iph. Finally, the effective
electron–hole recombination will be reduced in the nanocomposite
devices due to the more effective charge transport from well-distributed
Schottky junctions throughout the nanocomposite to electrodes. Last,
the efficiency of exciton dissociation and the follow-up charge transfer
would rely on the concentration of the ZnO/GnP heterojunctions based
on the minority diffusion length in the nanocomposite, which in turn
determines the photoresponsivity of the device in a similar way to
bulk heterojunction photovoltaics.36 Under
ultraviolet irradiation above the cutoff of a ZnO energy bandgap of
3.4 eV, an electron–hole pair is created (Figure 1b) and the electron and holes
are drawn away from one another due to the band bending at the interface
with the holes (electrons) moving to higher energy (lower energy)
in the valence band (conduction band).

(ZnOPr)/graphene nanoplatelet composite
ink, (b) energy band diagram of graphene and ZnO Schottky interface,
and (c) a schematic of graphene nanoplatelets with the Schottky interface.

Figure 2a,b,c,d
exhibits the optical images of the printed ZnO/GnP samples with GnP
concentrations of 0, 5, 20, and 30 mM, respectively. With increasing
GnP concentrations, features appear in the printed nanocomposite films
and the dimension of the features increases as well primarily due
to clumping of GnPs at higher concentrations. It should be pointed
out that the clumping of GnPs is unfavorable since it will reduce
the number of the Schottky junctions due to reduced ZnO/GnP interface
area and the performance of the optoelectronic devices based on the
ZnO/GnP nanocomposites. Figure 2e,f,g,h includes SEM images taken on the same set of samples
shown in Figure 2a,b,c,d,
respectively. At 5 mM GnP concentration, the features on the printed
ZnO/GnP nanocomposite film have the dimension of approximately 3–4
μm. The feature size remains approximately the same, with a
few larger ones of 5–7 μm on the sample with 20 mM GnP.
At 30 mM GnP concentration, the features become significantly larger
to about 6–12 μm in lateral dimension, indicating clumping
of the GnP flakes becomes serious at 30 mM or concentrations.

Figure 2 Optical images
are depicted for (a) 0 mM, (b) 5 mM, (c) 20 mM,
and (d) 30 mM GnP in ZnO/GnP nanocomposite films and (e–h)
the respective SEM images.

The Raman spectrum on a representative ZnO/GnP
nanocomposite film
of 20 mM GnP concentration is shown in Figure 3a, graphene is known to have two peaks, the
G peak at approximately 1584 cm–1 and the 2D peak
at 2729 cm–1, and a 2D/G peak ratio greater than
1.5 indicates single layer; otherwise, it is assumed to be multilayer
graphene.37−39 It should be noted that the difference in the Raman
spectra of the ZnO/GnP nanocomposite films with the GnP concentration
varied in the range of this experiment is negligible as the relative
peaks all showed similar traits (Figures S1). The shifts in the 2D peak and G peak away from single layer graphene
are consistent with multilayer graphene and graphite nanoplatelets.37,38 In addition, there is a peak at 436 cm–1 called
the E2 peak, which is associated with the c axis of the sol–gel-grown ZnO wurzite structure being perpendicular
to the substrate.40 The other peaks in Figure 3a are associated
with the Si/SiO2 wafer and the most intensive one is the
peak at 520 cm–1. From the Raman map in Figure 3b,c,d, we can see
that the flake sizes for the GnPs are approximately 2–4, 5–8,
and 8–12 μm, which can be observed for the 5, 20, and
30 mM GnP concentrations, respectively, which are consistent with
the SEM images. Specifically, the areal density of the features is
103 flakes/mm2 at 5 mM GnP, which increased
to 104 flakes/mm2 at 20 mM GnP. While the density
at 30 mM does not increase proportionally with the GnP concentration,
the dimension of the features is 10.2 ± 1.9 μm, while at
20 mM, the dimension of features is 5.4 ± 1.0 that is two times
different in average size and variation, indicating an increase in
segregation of the GnPs to GnP clumps in the ZnO/GnP nanocomposites
at 30 mM.

Figure 3 (a) Raman spectrum of the 20 mM ZnO/GnP film and (b–d) Raman
maps of graphene 2D peak for GnP/ZnO nanocomposite samples of 5, 20,
and 30 mM GnP concentrations.

The photocurrent as a function of the bias voltage
is shown in Figure 4a, where the photocurrent
is defined as Iph= IUV– IDark, where IUV and IDark are
the currents of the device under UV illumination and no illumination,
respectively, with the UV light source being 340 nm in wavelength
at a power of P = 4.6 ± 0.3 μW. In the
photocurrent–voltage characteristic curves, the photocurrent
increases monotonically with the GnP concentration up to 20 mM, confirming
the benefits of the ZnO/GnP Schottky junctions for efficient exciton
dissociation and charge transfer. At a higher GnP concentration of
30 mM, this benefit is reduced due to the GnP clumping. This trend
can be seen clearly in the photoresponsivity as a function of GnP
concentration in Figure 4b, where the photoresponsivity R is defined as R = Iph/P.41 The photoresponsivity was measured with a 5 V bias at a
wavelength of 340 nm and power of P = 4.6 ±
0.3 μW. Specifically, the photoresponsivity increases from 0.20
A/W for the printed ZnO only device to 0.22 A/W for the 5 mM ZnO/GnP
sample and to 0.82 A/W for 20 mM ZnO/GnP. At a higher GnP concentration
of 30 mM, it decreases to 0.71 A/W. In addition, the photoresponsivity
as a function of voltage was also calculated and shows a similar trend
as shown in Figure S2. The detectivity
(D*) as a function of voltage is also show in Figure S3 and shows a similar trend to the photoresponsivity
as a function of voltage (Figure S2) and
to the photocurrent as a function of voltage with the highest detectivity
being 20 mM GnP with D* = 2.03 × 1011 cm·Hz1/2·W–1 at a voltage
bias of −5 V. Here, D* is defined as , where A is the area,
which for our device is 0.45 mm2, R is
the photoresponsivity, and the root-mean-squared of the noise current
is . The mechanism responsible for the decrease
in photoresponsivity is shown in Figure 4c on the dynamic photoresponses measured
on these four samples. Interestingly, the dark current for the three
samples with lower GnP concentrations has comparable IDark, while the sample with 30 mM GnP concentration has
a considerably increased IDark. This means
that the reduced Iph in the ZnO/GnP nanocomposite
sample with 30 mM GnP concentration is primarily caused by the higher IDark. The rise times (fall times) are determined
from the time required to go from 10 to 90% (90 to 10%) of the photocurrent
and are depicted in Figure 4d. For the ZnO/GnP nanocomposite samples with for 0, 5, 20,
and 30 mM GnP concentrations, the rise/fall times are 9.6 s/17.2 s,
13.5 s/10.8 s, 20.6 s/15.7 s, and 16.2 s/23.6 s, respectively. These
rise and fall times and all photoresponsivity measurements were taken
at a bias voltage of 5 V. Basically, the rise and fall times remain
comparable at zero or low GnP concentrations. The moderately increased
rise and fall times at higher GnP concentrations of 20 and 30 mM may
be associated with large ZnO/GnP interfaces for charge trapping and
a highly conductive percolation path through GnPs. This is caused
by the GnP becoming dominant conducting materials at higher GnP concentration
much like other graphene-based photoconductors, and the high conductivity
of graphene can cause charges to the cycle through the material much
easier and allows for a longer photoconductive decay.

GnP concentrations. (c) Dynamic UV photoresponse (340 nm) at a 5 V
bias of the same four samples in (a) and (d) the extracted rise and
fall times from (c) for the four samples.

The photoresponsivity as a function of the UV light
power is depicted
in Figure 5a. The best
performance can be observed on the ZnO/GnP nanocomposite samples with
a GnP concentration of 20 mM. While the sample with a GnP concentration
of 30 mM suffers an increased IDark, it
considerably outperforms the samples with a low GnP concentration
of 5 mM and without any GnPs. The ZnO/GnP nanocomposite samples of
20 mM GnP concentration show the highest photoresponsivity of 2.2
A/W at 0.2 μW at a wavelength of 340 nm, which are 2.8 times
and 4.5 times higher than those of the samples with 0 mM (0.78 A/W)
and 5 mM (0.41 A/W) GnP concentrations at comparable UV light powers
of 0.20 and 0.27 μW, respectively. It should be noted that the
photoresponsivity decreases with increasing light power and is associated
with the device reaching complete saturation of charge in the conduction
band under increasing UV illumination, which means a reduction in
quantum efficiency at higher intensity.1,31 In Figure 5b, the spectral photoresponsivities
(normalized to the maximum responsivity value for feasibility of comparison)
for the samples with 0 and 20 mM GnP concentrations are compared.
The UV–vis transmission spectra were taken on the ZnO/GnP nanocomposite
samples, and the result is depicted in Figure S4. The absorption cutoff at approximately around 380 nm is
anticipated from the crystalline ZnO with a bandgap of 3.26 eV. The
similar cutoffs indicate that ZnO dominates the light absorption in
both samples. However, the ZnO/GnP nanocomposites induce a small red
shift of 20 nm in the cutoff to 380 nm, which corresponds to the bandgap
of ∼3.26 eV as opposed to ∼3.44 eV for the ZnO only
sample. While the mechanism for this shift requires further investigations,
we hypothesize moderate doping in ZnO through introduction of the
GnPs may occur resulting in better absorption of photons as indicated
in Figure S4. Nevertheless, this doping
is unlikely significant as illustrated in the moderate cutoff shift
and no bandgap state formation in the visible spectrum.

as a function of power of the ZnO/GnP nanocomposite
photodetectors with 0, 5, 20, and 30 mM GnP concentrations. Similarly,
we have (b) the spectral photoresponse comparing the best result to
pure ZnO, (c) dynamic photoresponse, and (d) dark current and photocurrent
as a function of time before and after the UTA treatment. PMMA passivation
was applied to the sample after UTA.

In Figure 5c, a
series of dynamic photoreseponse curves taken on ZnO/GnP nanocomposite
films of 20 mM GnPs over the course of approximately 17.7 weeks are
depicted. A clear trend of elongation of rise and fall times can be
observed between the solid black and red curves. This issue can be
attributed to the ZnO surface contamination by air molecule attachment.
To alleviate this issue, the ZnO/GnP device was treated with UTA 800
°C for 2 s.42 Remarkably, the optoelectronic
performance was resumed after the UTA as illustrated in the dynamic
response comparable (blue curve) to the initial red curve. In Figure 5c, the dynamic response
curves on a ZnO/GnP nanocomposite sample with PMMA printed on the
top as passivation to ambient exposure are also included. The much
reduced impact of the ambient exposure can be observed. To further
investigate, the dark current and photocurrent are plotted as a function
of time in Figure 5d where it is observed that the photocurrent and dark current increase
significantly from initial fabrication to 17.7 with no passivation;
however, there is severe elongation in rise and fall times as previously
mentioned. After UTA indicated by the dashed vertical line in Figure 5d, it is observed
that the dark current and photocurrent return to comparable values;
however, a few weeks after, the photocurrent increases significantly
again while maintaining a low dark current, which might be due to
the PMMA slowly aging and drying over time. As time increases, the
dark current more or less stays constant while the photocurrent shows
an exponential decay and then begins to level off. Interestingly,
the photocurrent levels off to a larger photocurrent than it had previously
obtained before UTA and passivation, while also maintaining a relatively
stable dark current, which indicates methods of passivation such as
with PMMA that can offer a viable method for stable packaging of devices
that show instability in ambient air.

Table 1 compares
the device performance of the ZnO/GnP nanocomposite UV detectors in
this work with a few other ZnO/graphene UV photodetectors. Basically,
the photodetectors in the table can be classified into two types:
nanocomposites that have advantages of low cost and scalability and
heterostructured nanohybrids by stacking semiconductor photosensitizers
on graphene. The UV detectors based on nanocomposites can be made
by inkjet printing or other low-cost approaches from premixed ZnO/GnP
inks or precursors.4,30 Particularly, in this work, through
introduction of ZnO/GnP Schottky junctions for better exciton dissociation
and photocarrier transfer, high photoresponsivity up to 0.82 A/W has
been obtained, which is 36 times and 6307 times better than nanocomposite
UV photodetector devices ZnO/graphene nanodot arrays and ZnO/graphite
nanocomposites, respectively, and 9 times better than a nanohybrid
device of Ag/Graphene/ZnO photodetectors.4,29,30 It should be noted that better device performance
has been observed in nanohybrid UV detectors by optimal device design
to take advantages of high carrier mobility of graphene, while scaling
up the nanohybrid detectors remains challenging.1,43−45 This means that further improvement of nanocomposite
UV detectors is possible through implementing nanohybrid device designs.

Conclusions
In this work, a new ZnOPrGnP composite
ink has been developed for
inkjet printing ZnO/GnP bulk heterojunction nanocomposite photoconductors
for ultraviolet detection. This ZnOPrGnP composite ink consists of
well-dispersed GnPs of concentrations of 0, 5, 20, and 30 mM mixed
with ZnOPr solution. The unique advantage of this composite ink is
in optimal formation of the ZnO/GnP interface during the ZnO crystallization
in the post-annealing after inkjet printing of the UV detectors. This
Schottky ZnO/GnP interface plays a critical role in exciton dissociation
and charge transfer as shown in the enhanced photoreponse with increasing
GnP concentration in the printed ZnO/GnP bulk heterojunction nanocomposites.
At an optimal GnP concentration of 20 mM, remarkable UV photoresponsivity
up to 2.2 A/W has been achieved at 2.2 μW and 5 V voltage biasing,
in contrast to 0.78 A/W in the samples with 0 mM GnPs measured the
at similar conditions. At a higher GnP concentration of 30 mM, a noticeable
increase in dark current was observed, resulting in reduction of the
photoresponsivity. Finally, we have explored refreshing the the ZnO/GnP
bulk heterojunction nanocomposite UV detectors using the UTA process
at 800 °C for 2 s in air and confirmed that the UTA is effective
in removing air molecule contamination of ZnO. Passivating the surface
of the ZnO/GnP with a PMMA after UTA treatment has shown promising
in prevention of the ambient degradation ZnO-based devices.

Experimental Details
The ZnOPrGnP nanocomposite ink
was obtained by mixing the GnPs
into ZnO precursor solution. The ZnO sol–gel precursor solution
was made following our previous works by dissolving equimolar amounts
of zinc acetate dihydrate and ethanolamine (500 mL, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich)
together and stirring under a heat of 60 °C until a clear gel
formed. 2-Methoxyethanol was then added such that the concentration
of zinc acetate dihydrate was approximately 0.3 M. The few-layer graphene
nanoplatelets (GnPs) (5–8 nm thick, XGnP-M-5, XG Sciences)
of 5, 20, and 30 mM concentrations were added into the ZnO sol–gel
precursor solution and ultrasonicated for 1 h until evenly dispersed
throughout the solution. Gold electrodes were deposited on SiO2/Si substrates to form a 0.3 mm × 3.0 mm effective printing
area using e-beam evaporation of Au (40 nm)/Ti (5 nm) with a shadow
mask. The substrate was heated with a hot plate to a temperature of
50 °C before printing. The ink was then dispensed utilizing a
piezoelectric vibration with the nozzle placed at a distance of ∼20
μm from the surface so that a capillary attraction of the liquid
to the substrate forms for easy dispensing. The printed area of the
ink is approximately 0.40 ± 0.1 mm2 and was cured
at 180 °C for 10 min after printing. The inkjet printer used
is a SonoPlot Microplotter Proto (Sonoplot) operated with SonoGuide
and SonoDraw software. The inkjet printer tips are boron silica glass
pipettes stretched out using a laser puller (P-2000 Micropipette Puller
System, Sutter Instrument Company), and the nozzle diameters are roughly
∼150 μm. Once the curing of the printed ink was completed,
the samples were placed into a furnace set to ramp up at a rate of
5 °C/min to a temperature of 350 °C for 2 h in air followed
with cooling with furnace power off. After samples were cooled down,
their optoelectronic performance was characterized immediately. Since
ZnO nanostructures have a large surface area that can be post-contaminated
in air and degraded performance afterward, some samples of long air
exposure were treated with the ultrafast thermal annealing (UTA) that
turned out to be efficient to remove the surface contamination as
illustrated in the comparable optoelectronic performance to that of
freshly fabricated ZnO/GnP bulk heterojunction devices.42 Optical images and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, JEOL JSM-6380) images were taken to reveal the sample morphology
and uniformity. Raman spectra and maps (Alpha 300 Confocal Raman,
WiTec) were collected to analyze the sample phase and crystallinity
and the distribution of GnPs in the printed GnP/ZnO films. Photoresponse
measurements were performed using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation
with a Newport Oriel Apex monochromator and Oriel Cornerstone 140
1/8m monochromator filter in the UV–visible spectra.
