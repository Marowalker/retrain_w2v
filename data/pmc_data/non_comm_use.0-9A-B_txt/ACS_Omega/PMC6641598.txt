A novel methodology for the epoxidation
of a broad range of primary,
secondary, and tertiary allylic alcohols is described using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant and Ti(III) species
generated by reduction of Ti(IV) complexes, with manganese (0) in
1,4-dioxane under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded
with wide substrate scope and high chemo- and diastereoselectivity.
A mechanistic pathway for the reaction is also discussed.

Introduction
The
epoxidation of allylic alcohols has attracted a considerable
interest in the industry since chiral epoxy alcohols are considered
useful building blocks for the synthesis of biologically active molecules.1 Currently, sharpless epoxidation is the most
efficient procedure for catalytic enantioselective epoxidation of
allylic alcohols.2 2,3-Epoxyalcohols have
also been synthesized by oxidation of allylic alcohols with alkylhydroperoxids,
catalyzed by d0 transition metal complexes.3,4

Titanocene monochloride, Cp2TiIIICl,5 has emerged as a useful reagent in organic chemistry
because of its versatility to generate single-electron-transfer reactions.6 It is involved in a wide range of organic transformations
including reduction reactions, additions to alkenes or alkynes, pinacol
couplings, Barbier-type reactions and C–C bond-forming reactions.7

Recently, our research group has reported
new mild reaction methodologies
mediated by the Ti(III) species, which have allowed us the cyclopropanation
of allylic alcohols,8 transesterification
of alcohols and phenols,9 and the protection
of alcohols as their 2-O-tetrahydrofuranyl and 2-O-tetrahydropyranyl ethers.10

Although epoxidations catalyzed by metallocenes have been
reported
previously,11 the use of the Ti(III) species
for epoxidation of allylic alcohols has hitherto not been reported.
As a part of our program for the development of new methods mediated
by metallocenes that can be applied in organic synthesis,8−10 in this article we report the first epoxidation of allylic alcohols
mediated by the Ti(III) complexes using tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxygen donor.

Results and Discussion
Our initial efforts focused on the use of geraniol (1) as a model substrate for the epoxidation. Cp2TiIIICl was prepared in situ by reduction of commercial Cp2TiCl2 (0.5 equiv) with manganese powder (12 equiv)
in deoxygenated tetrahydrofuran (THF). After the solution turned to
dark green (15 min),12 a solution of 1 (1 equiv) and anhydrous TBHP (1.5 equiv) were sequentially
added at room temperature (r.t.) and the mixture was stirred overnight.
However, the reaction only afforded 2,3-epoxygeraniol ((±)-1a) in 8% yield and with a poor conversion (entry 1, Table 1 and Scheme 1). Furthermore, the corresponding
2-O-tetrahydrofuranyl ether was also obtained (42%).10

b n.r. = no reaction.

Consequently, different reaction
conditions and solvents were evaluated
using geraniol as a model substrate, with the aim of improving the
yield of the epoxidation reaction. Formation of the Ti(III) species
in dry and deoxygenated 1,4-dioxane gave an enhanced yield (entry
2, Table 1). Further
experiments showed that the yield of (±)-1a was
increased to 40% by adding 4.0 equiv of TBHP (entry 3, Table 1). The yield was highly enhanced
when the reaction was performed at 45 °C affording (±)-1a in 86% yield (entry 5, Table 1). However, smaller amounts of TBHP (2.0
equiv) gave a lower yield (43%) under the same reaction conditions
(entry 4, Table 1).

Interestingly, when these latter reaction conditions were applied
but THF was used as a solvent, compound (±)-1a was
only isolated in 3% yield (compare entries 4 and 6, Table 1) together with a 55% yield
of the corresponding 2-O-tetrafuranyl ether.10 In the light of previous reports, this change
in the reactivity may be explained by any free coordination site in
the catalyst being occupied by a THF molecule.10,13 DME was a poorer solvent, generating (±)-1a in
moderate yield (entry 7, Table 1).

The results showed that not only was 1,4-dioxane
the best solvent
for this reaction but also the amounts of both Cp2TiCl2 and manganese were essential. Thus, the use of a lower equivalent
of Mn(0) (entry 8, Table 1) or stoichiometric and catalytic (0.2 equiv) amounts of Cp2TiCl2 (entries 9 and 10, Table 1) led to a decreased yield of (±)-1a. Finally, the reaction did not occur when the oxidant was
changed to H2O2 (entry 11, Table 1).

With the optimized
reaction conditions to hand, the roles of the
reagents in the course of the reaction were evaluated (Table 2). Compound (±)-1a was only obtained in 7% yield when the reaction was carried out
using just TBHP (entries 1 and 2, Table 2). Besides, it was noted that 2,3-epoxygeraniol
((±)-1a) was also obtained in poor yield when the
epoxidation was only performed either with Cp2TiCl2 or Mn(0), suggesting that the generation of a Ti(III) species
is necessary for the success of the reaction (entries 3 and 4, Table 2).

were evaluated by GC.

The
optimized epoxidation conditions were then evaluated with a
series of primary, secondary, and tertiary allylic alcohols and with
different substitution patterns of the alkene to define the scope
of the reaction (Table 3).

The 2,3-epoxyalcohols (±)-1a–5a, (±)-8a–b, (±)-9a–b, and (±)-12 that
contained 1,1,2- and 1,2,2-trisubstituted alkenes were all obtained
in excellent yields (entries 1–5, 8, 9, and 12, Table 3). Furthermore, the secondary
allylic alcohols were slightly more reactive than the primary alcohols
and the epoxides (±)-8a–b and
(±)-9a–b were obtained almost quantitatively
(entries 8 and 9, Table 3). However, the sterically more congested allylic alcohol 11 only gave epoxide 11a in a moderate yield (entry 11, Table 3). Disubstituted alkenes
were epoxidized in moderate yields (entries 6, 7, 10, and 13, Table 3). A larger amount
of TBHP (8 equiv) was required to increase the conversion of the primary
disubstituted allylic alcohols 6 and 7 (entries
6 and 7, Table 3).
The reaction was also applicable to tertiary allylic alcohols. Thus,
2,3-epoxyalcohol (±)-14a was obtained in 34% yield
from the tertiary monosubstituted alkene 14 (entry 14, Table 3). Finally, the epoxidation
did not proceed with nonallylic hydroxyl groups (entry 15, Table 3) or with protected
hydroxyl groups (entry 16, Table 3). Thereby, a free hydroxyl group that coordinates
to the titanium complex is demanded for this epoxidation.

The
reaction is chemoselective for the proximal double bond (entries
1–3, 10, and 11, Table 3). A remarkable feature of the reaction is its diastereoselectivity
achieving the isomer with syn orientation to the hydroxyl group. Thus,
the epoxide 11a obtained was enantiomerically pure from cis-carveol (11) and the epoxides (±)-12a and (±)-13a obtained were the only diastereoisomers
(entries 11–13, Table 3). A good erythroselectivity was observed for the A1,2 strained substrates (±)-8 and (±)-10, typical of Ti(OiPr)4-catalyzed epoxidations
(entries 8 and 10, Table 3).14 The A1,3 strained
substrate (±)-9 reacted with high threoselectivity
(entry 9, Table 3).

An unexpected product accompanied all of these epoxidations. Analysis
of its NMR spectroscopic data led to its identification as 2-hydroxy-1,4-dioxane,
which has been previously reported.15 The
formation of this oxidation product may be explained by hydrogen bonding
of TBHP to the solvent facilitating a radical hydroxylation adjacent
to the oxygen of the 1,4-dioxane. This has been reported in the presence
of other metals such as Cu and Ni.16 Consequently,
it is necessary to use higher amounts of TBHP to obtain good yields
in the presence of electron-poorer alkenes.

To obtain a deeper
insight into the reaction mechanisms, the enantioselectivity
of the reaction was explored with Brintzinger’s ansa-titanocene
catalyst A(17) and the chiral
titanium complex B(10) (Figure 1), using geraniol
as a model substrate. These complexes were reduced by manganese powder
in dry and deoxygenated 1,4-dioxane to obtain a green solution of
the corresponding Ti(III) species. Unfortunately, the reaction did
not proceed with any enantioselectivity.

titanium complexes A and B.

Nevertheless, epoxyalcohol (±)-1a was obtained
in a slightly higher yield using a catalytic amount of complex B (0.1 equiv) and milder reaction conditions (r.t. and only
2.0 equiv of TBHP) (entry 1, Table 4). Consequently, representative examples of allylic
alcohols with different substitution patterns (3, 5, 6, (±)-8, (±)-9, 11, and 14) were subjected to
these reaction conditions and to our delight, the corresponding 2,3-epoxyalcohols
were also obtained in better yields compared to those in the Cp2TiIIICl reaction (entries 3, 5–8, 10, and
11, Table 4). Compounds
(±)-5a–6a, (±)-8a–b, and (±)-9a–b were obtained almost quantitatively. There was also a remarkable
enhancement in diastereoselectivity of the reaction with the substrates
(±)-8 and (±)-9 compared with
epoxidation in the presence of Cp2TiIIICl (entries
7 and 8, Table 4).
The use of a stoichiometric amount of TBHP also led to compound (±)-9b in excellent yield (entry 9, Table 4), and only traces of 2-hydroxy-1,4-dioxane
were detected. However, this result could not be extended to the less
reactive alkenes 1 and 3 (entries 2 and
4, Table 4) probably
due to their slower rate of reaction. In these cases, an extra equivalent
of TBHP was required to obtain a good conversion.

by B
a Yields were evaluated

b Ratios were determined
by 1H NMR.

On
the basis of the experimental results and observed chemoselectivity
and diasteroselectivity, we propose the following mechanism. In the
first step, Cp2TiCl2 in 1,4-dioxane is reduced
by Mn(0) to Cp2TiIIICl and this complexes with
the allylic alcohol to give complex C.6b,8−10 Then, homolysis of the O–H bond affords an
activated alkyloxytitanium(IV) species (D), which has
been established in other reports.7e Reduction
of D by an excess of Mn(0) would achieve E. Then, TBHP is added, which is coordinated to E, obtaining
the Ti(III)–TBHP species (F). The reaction with
the oxygen from TBHP produces the corresponding epoxyalcohol complex
(G), with the concomitant loss of a tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) molecule. Finally, the epoxyalcohol
is released by coordination of a new molecule of the allylic alcohol.
Thereby, complex E is again regenerated (Scheme 2). It is worth noting that
the characteristic green color of a Ti(III) species is retained throughout
the reaction after the addition of TBHP, confirming the involvement
of this species in the epoxidation reaction. Besides, the high coordination
ability of allylic alcohols to form the complex E would
imply that the amounts of unbounded Cp2TiIIICl are so low that the epoxide opening was not detected.18 Finally, the formation of t-BuOH in the epoxidation was confirmed by GC–MS analysis of
the reaction mixture.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for Allylic Alcohol Epoxidation
Accordingly, the epoxidation
promoted by complex B could be explained following an
analogous mechanism. The higher
reactivity of this complex could be explained by its greater steric
rigidity and lower conformational mobility.10

Conclusions
A new mild and highly chemoselective and diastereoselective
method
for the epoxidation of allylic alcohols has been developed using either
bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium chloride or the reduced form of complex B and TBHP in 1,4-dioxane. This latter complex has been shown
to be a more efficient catalyst and the corresponding 2,3-epoxyalcohols
were obtained in higher yields at r.t. When the reaction was performed
in THF, the major reaction product was the corresponding 2-O-tetrafuranyl ether. Interestingly, 1,4-dioxane played
a crucial role in the accomplishment of the reaction since it was
poorly bonded to the free coordination site of the catalyst. Then,
the allylic alcohol and TBHP can be coordinated to the catalyst to
yield the epoxide instead of the protected alcohol.

Epoxides
from electron-rich alkenes were obtained in excellent
yields, whereas the epoxidation of disubstituted and monosubstituted
alkenes proceeded with moderate yields. The major advantage of the reaction
is its substrate scope taking place with epoxidation not only from
primary and secondary allylic alcohols but also from tertiary allylic
alcohols, which do not react under Sharpless epoxidation conditions,
this methodology being an alternative to other widely known allylic
alcohol epoxidation methods.

Experimental Section
All reactions
were carried out in flame-dried flasks under argon
atmosphere. The starting materials were obtained from commercial suppliers,
and solvents used for column chromatography were purchased in reagent
grade. THF, DME, and 1,4-dioxane were dried from Na-benzophenone and
degassed for 30 min under argon before use. 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on an Agilent 500 MHz spectrometer (tetramethylsilane
at δH 0 ppm, CHCl3 at δH 7.25 ppm as an internal reference), and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded with an Agilent 125 MHz spectrometer (CHCl3 at δC 77.00 ppm as an internal reference). Coupling
constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). IR spectra
were obtained on a Fourier transform infrared instrument. High resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight
mass spectrometer using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)
in positive mode at 20 V cone voltage. GC analysis was performed using
a CycloSil-B chiral column. Column chromatography was carried out
on silica gel (Merck, 0.05–0.20 mesh), and thin-layer chromatography
was carried out with 0.25 mm Merck silica gel plates (F254) and visualized either under UV light or by staining
with vanillin solution followed by heating. High performance liquid
chromatography was performed on a Hitachi/Merck L-6270 equipment using
a LiChrospher Si 60 (5 μm) column.

Sodium borohydride
(450.1 mg, 11.9 mmol) was added at r.t. to a solution of trans-2-methylbut-2-enal (1000 mg, 11.9 mmol) and CeCl3·7H2O (4433.3 mg, 11.9 mmol) in methanol (144 mL) and THF (72
mL) and stirred for further 15 min until consumption of the aldehyde.
Then, it was poured with 10 mL of a solution of 1 M HCl and 50 mL
of water. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the aqueous phase
was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic
layers were washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (100 mL) and then dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4. Lastly, the solvent was
removed in vacuo and the residue was purified by flash chromatography
using hexane/ethyl acetate (90:10) to afford trans-2-methylbut-2-enol (4) (891.7 mg, 87% yield). Physical
data of 4 were consistent to those previously reported
for this compound.19

General Procedure

To a solution of the
corresponding aldehydes (6 mmol) in THF (15 mL) at 0 °C was added
dropwise pentylmagnesium bromide (6 mL, 2 M solution in Et2O). After 3 h at r.t., saturated NH4Cl (20 mL) was added.
The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with
ethyl acetate (3 × 30 mL). The organic layers were combined,
washed with brine (70 mL), and then dried over Na2SO4. The corresponding alcohols, (±)-8 and
(±)-9, were isolated after evaporation of the solvent
by flash chromatography column on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate
90:10).

in rigorously degassed THF, DME, or 1,4-dioxane (12.7 mL) was stirred
at r.t. until a color change from red to dark green (15 min for THF

(0.64 mmol) was added via syringe and stirred for further 15 min.
TBHP (0.42 mL, 5.0 M solution in nonane) was added and the reaction
crude was heated at 45 °C overnight. The mixture was filtered
through a pad of celite after pouring water (0.5 mL). Evaporation
of the solvent followed by purification of the crude product by column
chromatography on silica gel gave the corresponding epoxy alcohols
