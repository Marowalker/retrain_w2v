Electron-withdrawing/coordinating o-phenolacetyl-substituted
viologen can act as a visual sensor for solvents, bases, and temperature
in organic solvents. Due to chelating phenolacetyl groups, this viologen
can coordinate to Fe(III), Cu(II), and ZnCl2 in aqueous
and DMF solutions. Interestingly, this viologen can respond to temperature,
grind, and NH3 vapor in its solid state. Stimuli response
is visible, fast, and fully reversible in air at room temperature.
The color change is attributed to the enolic and/or free radical structure.
This is the most versatile chromic material that responds to chemical
and physical stimuli in both solution and solid state.

Introduction
Viologens (1,1′-disubstituted
4,4′-bipyridinium)
have gained much attention over the past 80 years.1 Acting as strong electron acceptors, viologens undergo
two reversible reduction steps generating a radical cation (V•+) and a neutral form (V0) under appropriate
external chemical or physical stimuli, such as pH, light, or electric
potential.2−5 Interest in viologen derivatives has grown, amongst other things,
because of the simplicity of synthesis and tunability, the high degree
of control over their reversible redox process, the range of colors
from being colorless (V2+) to green/blue/purple (V•+), the paramagnetic nature of V•+, and the strong structural templating effects (V2+).6 These possibilities have led to the incorporation
of viologens in a series of donor–acceptor complexes developed
for various applications such as photochromic and electrochromic displays,2−4,7 solar energy storage devices,8,9 fluorescence,10,11 supramolecular host–guest
complexes12,13 and molecular machines,14 and ferroelectrics.15

Key to the design and successful use of viologens is a basic understanding
of their physical and chemical responses to external stimuli. Recently,
two viologen-based covalent organic polymers have been reported by
Trabolsi et al.16 Their research showed
that the viologen-based polymer displayed solid-state thermochromism
owing to the formation of radical cations. Crystalline materials of
viologens also showed thermochromism mostly caused by the donor–acceptor
interactions in a complex that lead to charge-transfer absorption
due to the donor–acceptor interactions in a complex. They showed
the chromic properties only in solid state,17−20 possibly because solution studies
are hindered by an unsteady color change and the poor solubility of
these materials in proper solvents. Thermochromism of viologens in
solution has no precedent and is a challenge that remains to be explored.

Mechanochromic dyes are a unique type of stimuli responsive materials
that change their color in response to external stimuli such as hydrostatic
pressure or shear force. Tetraphenylethylene and carbazole have shown
mechanochromism because of fluorescence change after grinding.21−25 By introducing electron-poor aromatics in organic sulfide, Verolet
et al. studied a planarizable push–pull mechanofluorochromic
material.26 Recently, Qi et al. reported
high-contrast mechanochromism and polymorphism-dependent fluorescence
of difluoroboron β-diketonate complexes.22 The mechanofluorochromic effect is based on aggregation-induced
emission. Existing mechanochromic dyes are generally monitored by
fluorescence but not by the naked eye.27 Thus, high-contrast, naked-eye-detectable mechanochromic material
is of great interest. Thermochromic materials have wide applications
and have received great attention of late. Although viologen compounds
as thermochromic compounds have been reported at temperatures higher
than 200 °C, their response is slow (20 min) and insignificant28,29 with a continuous need to improve sensitivity and contrast.

Ammonia is widely used for industrial applications, such as fertilizers
and refrigeration. It is a hazardous material with toxic, corrosive
effects and is difficult to handle as contact with skin or its inhalation
is extremely dangerous to health. Development of new materials for
ammonia sensory and capture, therefore, is essential for the safe
containment and management of ammonia. Trabolsi et al. synthesized
viologen polymer as an NH3 sensor, which darkens in color
upon exposure to gaseous NH3 for ∼1 min. The NH3-fumed dark-colored polymer can then be re-oxidized into light
color species using gaseous HCl (7 min).16 For practical applications, faster response is needed, in our opinion.

Taking into account that the chromism of viologen is due to the
electron transfer from donor to acceptor (viologen), electron-withdrawing
substituents tend to increase the electron-deficiency and thus may
increase their chromic sensitivity. Although viologen-containing metal–organic
frameworks have been reported, viologen as a ligand that interacts
with metal ions in solution is still absent. To investigate viologen
complexes in solution, we introduce o-phenolacetyl
as the coordination/chelate group (Scheme 1). Interestingly, this phenolacetyl viologen
(1,1′-bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4,4′-bipyridinium
bromide, abbreviated as H4pavBr2) with highly
active methylene can respond to bases (halochromic), solvents, temperature,
metal ions in solution, as well as temperature, grind, and gaseous
NH3 and HCl in solid state instantly. These stimuli responses
are not only fast but also fully reversible and obvious to the naked
eye. To our knowledge, this is the most versatile chromic material
that produces visually obvious responses to different chemical and
physical stimuli.

Scheme 1 Structure of Phenolacetyl Functionalized Viologen
H4pavBr2
Experimental Section
4,4-Bipyridine (Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent), 2-bromo-2′-hydroxyacetophenone
(ENERGY Reagent), all other chemicals were used as received without
further purification. Solutions were prepared with subboiled distilled
water in an all-quartz apparatus. Synthetic details are summarized
in Supporting Information.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a
Bruker AV 500 MHz spectrometer. TOF mass spectra were collected on
an Agilent 6510Q. ESI mass spectra were performed on a Shimadzu LCMS-2020.
The elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were obtained on a Vario EL III
analyzer. UV–vis absorption spectra were performed using a
Puxi TU-1900 spectrometer with a 1.0 and 0.1 cm quartz cell equipped
with a temperature-controlled water bath (25 °C). Pure solvents
were used as references. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra
were recorded using a JES-FA 200 spectrometer fitted with the DICE
ENDOR accessory, EN801 resonator, and an ENI A-500 rf power amplifier.

NH3 and HCl vapor sensing was performed in air at room
temperature. NH3 vapor (on top of 25% NH3 aqueous
solution) was withdrawn using a syringe. The vapor in the syringe
was injected on the surface of the sample or paper from ∼5
cm. HCl vapor was taken from 36% HCl aqueous solution. Other experimental
procedures were identical to those reported in the literature.30

Results and Discussion
Solvatochromic and Halochromic
H4pavBr2 was synthesized according to a reported
procedure and characterized
by elemental analysis, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR,
and MS (see Supporting Information). 1H NMR indicates that free H4pavBr2 exists
in the ketone form (Figure S1). The color
of H4pavBr2 in solution depends on concentrations,
solvents, and NaOH (Figure 1). The spectrometric data in different solvents are summarized
in Table S1. Regressing maximum absorption
wavelength λ (1.0 × 10–5 M) with solvent
polarity (ETN)31 (i.e., λ
= aETN + b), we have a = −45
and b = 580. Stronger polarity shifted wavelength
shorter. H4pavBr2 turned out to be a negative
solvatochromic dye.

Figure 1 Photographic images exhibiting the solvatochromic and
halochromic
behaviors. 1.0 × 10–4 M (a) and 1.0 ×
10–5 M (b) H4pavBr2 in different
solvents. The color in the presence of different equivalents of NaOH
in H2O (5.0 × 10–5 M, c), DMSO (1.0
× 10–5 M, d), and DMF (1.0 × 10–4 M, e). NaOH equivalence and pH (in H2O) are labeled in
black and red, respectively.

The color of H4pavBr2 in the presence
of
NaOH differs greatly in different equivalents of NaOH in H2O, DMF, and DMSO (Figure 1). From Figure 1, it can be seen that H4pavBr2 is not only
solvatochromic but also halochromic. The halochromic effect is much
more effective in organic solvents than in H2O. These phenomena
are roughly comparable with previous reports.30,32 For reference, spectra details are shown in Figures S2–S4.

1H NMR of H4pavBr2 shows quite
clean spectra in DMSO (Figure S5, red line).
Upon adding 0.5 equiv NaOD (purple color), the CH2 group
splits into two signal in a 2:1 ratio (Figure S5). This may indicate that one ketone is tautomerized into
the enolic structure (Scheme 1) or ylide.33,34 The purple-blue color that peaked
at 610 nm (in 1–2 equiv NaOD) refers to obviously deprotonated
enolic species.

Figure S2 shows UV–vis
spectral
changes of 5.0 × 10–5 M H4pav2+ upon gradually adding NaOH in aqueous solution. At 0.5,
1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 equiv NaOH (half-protonation), the pH values are
6.46, 6.58, 7.14, and 8.61, respectively, indicating the four pKas. The first two pKas correspond to the enolic protons, whereas the last two correspond
to the phenol hydroxyl pKas.32 A weakly acidic medium can deprotonate enolic
protons, whereas a basic medium will deprotonate the phenol protons.
The disappearance of phenol proton in 1–3 equiv NaOD in DMSO
(Figure S5) is possibly due to proton exchange
with D2O (in the NaOD solution). Based on the pH titration
(Figure S2), the proposed deprotonation
processes are illustrated in Scheme S1.

EPR spectra were investigated to elucidate the possible species.
H4pavBr2 at 1.0 × 10–3 M is colorless and EPR-silent. After 5 equiv NaOH was added, it
became pale blue with an EPR signal of free radical at g = 2.00. Adding hyposulfite will deepen the color and strengthen
the EPR signal (Figure S6).30,32 It is worth to mention that the colored sample in DMSO seems EPR-silent.
The color in organics is from the enolic and/or deprotonated enolic
structure.

Interaction with Metal Ions
As the
phenolacetyl contains
two coordinating oxygen atoms, it may interact with metal ions. Fosso
et al. reported that there were no differences between the curves
obtained in the absence and presence of CuCl2, suggesting
that this phenol ketone (2′-hydroxychalcone) does not bind
Cu(II) at room temperature from pH 2 to 12 in aqueous solution.35 Although Křikavová have recently
proved that 2′-hydroxychalcone can coordinate with Cu(II) in
the chelate mode in the presence of triethylamine in methanol solution,36 there is no report on whether viologen-containing
ligands can interact with metal ions and how metal ions influence
the color of viologen compounds in solution.

Figure S7 shows the spectral changes of 1.0 × 10–3 M H4pavBr2 upon gradually adding
4 equiv metal ions into DMF solution. NiCl2, CoCl2, and BaCl2 have insignificant interactions with H4pavBr2 in DMF as the 562 nm peak is almost identical
to that of free H4pavBr2. Although AlCl3, FeCl3, and CuCl2 can significantly
decrease the 562 nm absorbance, ZnCl2 can obviously increase
the 562 nm absorbance. Figure 2a shows the spectral changes of 1.0 × 10–3 M H4pavBr2 upon gradually adding ZnCl2 into DMF solution. The color deepens as the 562 nm absorbance
increases with the increase in ZnCl2. 1H NMR
spectra (Figure 2b)
show the deprotonated enolic structure in the presence of ZnCl2, which is similar to that of NaOH. This indicates that Zn(II)
is chelated to the enolic structure of phenolacetyl. However, there
is essentially no interaction between ZnCl2 and H4pavBr2 in aqueous solution.

Figure 2 Metal ion response of
H4pavBr2. (a) UV–vis
spectral changes of 1.0 × 10–3 M H4pavBr2 upon gradual addition of ZnCl2 in DMF
solution. Color changes from purple to deep blue. (b) 1H NMR of H4pavBr2 in the absence or presence
of different amounts of ZnCl2 in DMSO. (c) Spectra of a
5.0 × 10–4 M H4pavBr2 and 1.0 × 10–3 M Fe(NO3)2 aqueous solution in the presence of different amounts of NaOH (0.10
cm cell). (d) Spectra of a 5.0 × 10–4 M H4pavBr2 and 1.0 × 10–3 M
Cu(NO3)2 aqueous solution in the presence of
different amounts of NaOH (0.10 cm cell).

Fe(III) and Cu(II) have a significant interaction with H4pavBr2 in the presence of NaOH (Figure 2). H4pavBr2 is essentially
colorless (Figures 1 and S2) in aqueous solution at pH 6–10.
In the presence of 2 equiv Fe(NO3)3, the solution
is colorless at pH < 4 (4 equiv NaOH or less). The solution becomes
pink-orange at pH 4–5.7 (Figure 2c). Further increase in pH will significantly darken
the color (5 equiv NaOH or higher). The purple-blue color peaked at
∼544 and ∼650, which are different from those in the
absence of metal ions. This also indicates that enolic phenolacetyl
may possibly chelate to Fe(III). Cu(II) has a similar spectral change
except higher pH is needed, indicating less chromic sensitivity compared
with Fe(III). Different from those of Fe(III), there is no peak at
>600 nm. A similar structure, 2′-hydroxychalcone (without
viologen),
can form copper complex with maximum absorbance at 533 nm.36 The color of Cu(II) complex is obviously lighter
than that of the corresponding Fe(III) complex at the same pH. Further
increase will form a very dark precipitation of the corresponding
complex. The FT-IR spectra clearly show the deprotonation of phenol
proton (3392 cm–1) and the carbonyl shifted from
1646 cm–1 in H4pavBr2 to 1557
(Fe complex) and 1569 cm–1 (Cu complex), which agrees
well with the enolic phenolacetyl chelate. H4pavBr2 can sense Fe(III) and Cu(II) in aqueous solution and ZnCl2 in DMF solution.

Thermochromic in Solution
The color
of H4pavBr2 is also temperature-sensitive both
in organic solution
and in solid state. Figure 3 shows 562 nm absorbance of 1.0 × 10–3 M H4pavBr2 at different temperatures in DMF
solution. The 562 nm absorbance gradually increases with the increase
in temperature. Once the solution has cooled, the color reverts. The
thermochromic behavior is relatively stable up to 5 cycles (Figure 3). Variable-temperature
NMR in DMSO solution did provide evidence for thermochromism (Figure S9). The chemical shift of phenolic hydroxyl
hydrogen shifted to a higher field as temperature increases, whereas
the methylene hydrogen shifted to a lower field. All aromatic protons
remained constant. The single methylene peak splits slightly into
two peaks at 60 °C or higher (Figure S9). Higher temperature favors enolic tautomerism. Thermochromic behavior
in solid state is also visible to the naked eye. Increased temperature
will also significantly deepen the color, especially at 80 °C.
The thermochromic change in solid state has a much better reversibility.
Deepening of color with increase in temperature is quite fast (<1
min), whereas color bleach in lower temperature needed much longer
times (∼5 min). We were able to recycle the material tens of
times without observable degradation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first example of a thermochromic viologen in solution.
The thermochromic behavior in solid state at 60–80 °C
is also much sensitive than the literature values at higher than 200
°C and 20 min.28,29 We believe this viologen may
open an avenue for future development of thermochromic materials for
daily life and industry.

(top) and solid state (bottom). Absorbance at 562 nm of 1.0 ×
10–3 M H4pavBr2 at different
temperatures in DMF (top). Filter paper (soaked in 1.0 × 10–3 M H4pavBr2 aqueous solution
and dried in air) as the temperature indicator at different temperatures.

Mechanochromic and Thermochromic
in Solid State
In
running IR experiments, we found that H4pavBr2 changes color after grinding, which directed us to investigate its
mechanochromism. Mechanochromics are manifolds ranging from simple
changes in the molecular geometries and phase transitions from one
structure to another to distinct disturbance of the ground and excited
states.23,24 The color of H4pavBr2 turns from pale yellow to dark green after grinding (Figure 4). Reflectance spectra indicate
that H4pavBr2 essentially has no absorbance
at >450 nm. The green ground sample has very strong absorbance
at
600 nm. 1H NMR of H4pavBr2 before
and after grinding (in DMSO) shows that protons adjacent to pyridinium
have the largest shift (−0.025 ppm for aromatic H and −0.022
for methylene H). This indicates that the positive charge on pyridinium
decreased. EPR spectra show free radical formation after grinding
(Figure S11). The XRD patterns of H4pavBr2 before and after grinding are essentially
the same except for slightly broader and weaker signals in the ground
sample (Figure S12). The TG–DSC
curve of the ground green sample is almost identical to that of the
unground one (Figure S14) except that the
ground sample decomposes at 10 °C lower than the unground sample.
This value is obviously larger than the 3 °C difference reported
in the literature.21

presentation of mechanochromic and NH3 sensor (samples
are numbered). (b) 1.0 × 10–4 M H4pavBr2 aqueous solution written on filter paper that responds
to NH3 gas instantly. (c) Reflectance spectra of H4pavBr2 before and after grinding and NH3 fume.

NH3 Vapor Sensor
in Solid State
H4pavBr2 can respond
to bases not only in solution but also
in solid state (Figures 4, S11, and S12). Light yellow H4pavBr2 immediately becomes purple-blue once fumed with
NH3 vapor (from 25% ammonia aqueous solution). This purple-blue
sample immediately reverts to light yellow when fumed with HCl vapor.
The result is similar to that of our previous work and attributed
to the formation of viologen radicals (Figure S11).30 The ground H4pavBr2 changes from dark green to black-purple once fumed
with NH3 and reverted to yellow when fumed with HCl. The
NH3 coloration and HCl bleaching are fast and fully reversible
at room temperature. Notably, the ground sample (green) underwent
self-recovery to its original light yellow after standing at room
temperature for several days. The ground sample is more sensitive
to NH3 than the original unground sample as it has a much
dark color compared with the unground H4pavBr2 (Figure 4a). Reflectance
spectra of H4pavBr2 before and after grinding
and their response to NH3 (gas) and HCl (gas) are shown
in Figure 4. Sample
4 is almost black as it has no reflectance at <700 nm. Unground
H4pavBr2 has strong absorbance at ∼590
nm after NH3 fume, whereas the ground green sample has
absorbance at ∼620 nm. All colored samples reverted to their
original yellow after standing at room temperature for days.

To better/conveniently use this compound as an NH3 sensor,
1.0 × 10–4 M H4pavBr2 aqueous solution was used as invisible ink written on cellulose
filter paper. The colorless paper (dried at room temperature) immediately
became purple-blue when fumed with NH3. Removal from fume
rendered it completely colorless within 5 s (Supporting Information video). HCl fume will immediately bleach the paper.
This paper can be used in NH3 production, transportation,
and storage as an indicator of vapor leakage. Such a sensor can also
be reused several hundred times without observable degradation. With
electron-withdrawing ketone group, H4pavBr2 has
much better sensitivity than the literature-reported viologen polymer,
which has NH3 response (1 min) and HCl (7 min).16

Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel
phenolacetyl viologen was synthesized. This
viologen not only exhibits solvatochromism, halochromism, thermochromism,
and mechanochromism and sensors solvents, pH, temperature, and mechanical
force but also exhibits metallochromism and vapochromism and can respond
to Zn(II), Cu(II), and Fe(III) in solution and NH3 in vapor.
No other compounds have such versatile chromic properties. The chromic
behavior is mainly due to the enolic structure in solution and free
radicals in solid state.
