In
this work, CdS quantum dots (QDs)-sensitized self-doped Bi2MoO6 has been
synthesized using glucose as reducing agent by hydrothermal method,
followed by in situ deposition of the QDs. The synthesized catalyst
has been employed to reduce toxic Cr(VI) and degrade phenol from the
aqueous solution. The structural, optical,
and electrochemical characterizations are performed using X-ray diffraction,
UV–vis diffuse reflection, photoluminescence (PL), scanning
electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
The optical properties were precisely investigated by calculating
the Urbach energy, PL, and photoluminescence excitation spectra. The
orderly distribution of QDs is confirmed from the correlation between
full width at half-maximum of PL spectra, Urbach energy, and TEM analysis.
The versatile photocatalytic activity has been tested toward Cr(VI)
reduction and degradation of phenol. 3% CdS QDs-sensitized self-doped
Bi2MoO6 showed highest activity, i.e., 97 and
47.5% toward reduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol under solar
light. The reduction of Cr(VI) by the catalyst is supported by the
kinetics and determination of the pHPZC value. In addition
to this, the photostability and reusability test showed that the catalyst
can be reused up to five cycles without diminishing its activity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Bi2MoO6 is an active and simplest member
of the Aurivillius oxide family of layered perovskites that has attracted
increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis because of its
luminescence, photocatalytic properties, low band gap energy, layered
structure, and suitable band edge potential.1−3 Additionally,
its resistivity toward corrosion, mesoporosity, low cost, outstanding
chemical stability, and attractive physicochemical properties also
contribute to its improved photocatalytic activity. The Aurivillius
oxide (γ-Bi2MoO6) possesses a distinctive
layered structure with perovskite wedges of MoO6 octahedra
sandwiched between alternating (Bi2O2)2+ layers.4 It should be mentioned here
that depending on the proportions of bismuth and molybdenum present
bismuth molybdate (BMO) may exist in a variety of phases, among which
the Bi2Mo3O12 or α-phase,5 the Bi2Mo2O9 or β-phase,6 and the Bi2MoO6 or γ-phase are commonly studied.7 The ratio of Bi to Mo in α-, β-,
and γ-phases are 2/3, 2/2, and 2/1, respectively. Of these phases,
γ-phase is known to possess more mobile oxygen, whereas α-
and β-phases provide more absorption sites for hydrocarbons.
However, the consensus is that mixture of both γ-phase and α-
or β-phase shows better photocatalytic activity than any single
phase of bismuth molybdate due to the synergy effect8 that takes place in the mixture. This modification of the
individual γ-phase is performed to optimize its photocatalytic
activity, viz., to overcome its inherent bottlenecks, which include
low efficiency toward utilization of visible light, fast recombination
and transport of photogenerated charge carriers, modest surface area,
less active sites, and poor selectivity toward redox reactions. Apart
from the synergic mixture of interphase composites, the photocatalytic
activity has also been improved by making composite with noble metal
(Ag, Pt). Yuan et al.9 decorated a Bi2MoO6 microsphere uniformly with Ag nanoparticles
for the photodegradation of methyl orange, methylene blue, and rhodamine
B. Ag here acts as electron sink, which facilitates charge transfer
via the Schottky barrier at the interface of the noble metal and Bi2MoO6. Zhang and co-workers10 synthesized ultrathin Bi2MoO6 nanoplates loaded
with Pt nanoparticles as co-catalyst and demonstrated their superior
photocatalytic performance toward aerobic selective oxidation of benzyl
alcohol. Understanding the significance of surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) and sidestepping the high cost of noble metals, Zhao et al.11 synthesized Bi co-catalyst loaded on Bi2MoO6 microspheres nanohybrid inspiring by the fact
that Bi also exhibits the noble metal behavior, i.e., direct plasmonic
resonance and the matched band edge positions with Bi2MoO6.

To improve the visible light absorption ability, the
effective
separation of the electron–hole pairs, and the photocatalytic
activity of Bi/Bi2MoO6, in this work, CdS quantum
dots (QDs) have been incorporated into the reaction system to activate
the substrate and effectively lower the activation energy of the desired
reaction because of their quantum confinement effect, high dispersity,
large absorption coefficient, ultrasmall particle size, narrow band
gap of around 2.29 eV, and the wavelength- and size-dependent photoluminescence
(PL) emission.12

In this work, we
have designed solar light-driven CdS QDs-sensitized
self-doped Bi2MoO6 for the reduction of Cr(VI)
and degradation of phenol. Detailed investigation of the prepared
materials like phase purity, crystal structure, optical and photoluminescence
properties, and effect of point of zero charge (PZC) was carried out.
The prepared material exhibit the synergistic effect of Bi and CdS
QDs for better photocatalytic activity toward fast reduction of Cr(VI)
and phenol degradation. The mechanisms of both Cr(VI) and degradation
of phenol have been studied in detail. The mechanistic pathway is
well explained by employing the scavenger test and the involvement
of active species, which is established from the respective confirmatory
tests.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis
of Bismuth Molybdate (BMO) and Self-Doped
Bismuth Molybdate (BBMO)
For the synthesis of BMO, the typical
procedure involves the dissolution of 0.242 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.06 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O in 10 mL of ethylene glycol separately.
The two solutions were mixed and dropwise added to 30 mL of isopropanol,
followed by stirring for 20 min. Then, the prepared solution was transferred
to a stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 24 h,
followed by cooling to room temperature. The BMO sample was collected
by centrifugation and washed several times with water and once with
ethanol and finally dried at 80 °C for few hours.13

To synthesize BBMO, 5 mL of ethylene glycol
(EG; Merck) containing 1.6866 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Merck) marked as solution A and 5 mL of EG containing 0.4210
g of Na2MoO4·2H2O marked as
solution B were prepared. Solution B was then added dropwise to solution
A with continuous stirring. To this mixture, 20 mL of EG was added
and stirred to get a clear solution. A small amount of glucose
(0.616 g; Merck) was added to get suspension with strong stirring.
Then, the solution was transferred to a 100 mL stainless steel Teflon-lined
autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 20 h. After the hydrothermal
treatment, the product was collected by centrifugation and subsequent
washing with water and ethanol two times each. The deep gray Bi/Bi2MoO6 was dried overnight at 60 °C and symbolized
as BBMO.11

2.2 Synthesis
of CdS QDs-Sensitized BBMO
To prepare CdS QDs-sensitized
Bi/Bi2MoO6 (CBBMO),
particular amount of BBMO was taken and the procedure to deposit required
weight percentage of CdS QDs was followed according to our previous
work.12 Briefly, appropriate amount of
BBMO was added to a 75 mM Cd(NO3)2·2H2O solution. Requisite amount of thioglycolic acid (TGA) was
added to the solution so that the mole ratio of 1:2 was maintained
between TGA and CdS QDs, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to
10.5 with 1 M NaOH. After this, Na2S was added and the
prepared solution was stirred at 65 °C for 30 min. Then, after
90 min aging, the prepared sample was collected by centrifugation,
followed by three times washing with water and once with ethanol.
Finally, the composite was dried in a vacuum desiccator.

2.3 Experimental Protocol for Reduction of Cr(VI)
and Phenol Degradation
For the reduction of Cr(VI), the aqueous
solution of K2Cr2O7 was used. A 20
mL volume of 100 ppm hexavalent Cr solution was taken with 0.02 g
of catalysts to test the photocatalytic activity. To check the effect
of pH on the photocatalytic reduction process, the pH of the solution
was maintained at 2, 4, 6, and 8. Then, the suspension was stirred
under dark condition for 30 min to attain the adsorption and desorption
equilibrium before irradiation under solar light (100 000 lx).
At different time intervals, the catalysts were separated by centrifugation
and the supernatant was used for colorimetric analysis at 540 nm by
1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) method using a JASCO V-750 UV−Vis
spectrophotometer.14 Additionally, the
remained Cr in the sample after the experiment was also determined.15

Photocatalytic degradation of phenol was
carried out by taking 20 mg of catalyst with 20 mL of 10 ppm phenol.
Then, the suspension was stirred under dark condition for 30 min to
attain the adsorption and desorption equilibrium before irradiation
of solar light. Then, the pH of phenol solution was maintained at
2, 4, 6, and 8. After the photocatalytic experiment, the catalyst
was extracted from the phenol solution by centrifugation and the residue
was directly analyzed by a JASCO V-750 UV−Vis spectrophotometer.

2.4 Analytical Characterization
The phase
purity and crystal structure of the CdS QDs-sensitized self-doped
bismuth molybdate samples were analyzed by a Rigaku Miniflex instrument
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) in the 2θ
range of 20–80°. A JASCO V-750 UV−Vis
spectrophotometer was used to measure the diffuse reflection UV–vis
(DRUV–vis) spectra in the wavelength range of 200–800
nm. The photoluminescence property of the prepared samples was analyzed
by a JASCO-FP-8300 fluorescence spectrometer. The emission and excitation
spectra were taken to explain the uniform distribution of QDs on the
surface of BBMO. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out
using ZEISS SUPRA 55. The microsphere structure of BBMO and ultrasmall
particle size of CdS QDs were investigated by a TEM-JEOL-2010- 200
kV instrument. The mode of molecular vibration was determined by a
FT/IT-4600 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the range of
4000–400 cm–1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was performed with a VG Microtech Multilab ESCA 3000 spectrometer
using a nonmonochromatized Mg Kα X-ray source. The C 1s peak
was used for binding energy correction, which arises from adventitious
source. The electrochemical study of the prepared samples was carried
out by a multichannel Ivium potentiostat to know the photoelectrochemical
properties. This was carried out in a Pyrex electrochemical cell using
the synthesized catalysts as the working electrode, platinum sheet
as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.
The electrolyte utilized here to analyze the study was 0.1 M Na2SO4, and a 300 W Xe lamp was used for light irradiation
with a 400 nm cutoff filter.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Phase Structure
Figure 1a shows the
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern describing the crystal structure and phase purity of
the as-prepared photocatalysts. The XRD pattern of Bi/Bi2MoO6 (BBMO) consists of diffraction peaks for both orthorhombic
Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS no. 21-0102) and rhombohedral
Bi (JCPDS no. 44-1246). Several diffraction peaks at 2θ values
of 27.01, 31.2, 44.2, 53.6, 53.8, and 55.7° are indexed as (131),
(200), (202), (062), (133), and (191) crystal planes of Bi2MoO6. In addition to these, diffraction peaks at 27.8,
37.5, 39.2, and 45.6° are observed corresponding to the (012),
(104), (110), and (006) planes in prepared composite materials, which
confirms the occurrence of Bi in metallic state. The XRD result confirmed
the formation of well crystalline materials without any impurities.
In addition to this, no characteristic diffraction peaks of CdS QDs
are observed, which is attributed to low CdS QDs content in the prepared
samples.12 As the XRD peaks of Bi2MoO6 and metallic Bi are overlapped in the range of 27–28
and 44–46°, the corresponding planes are deconvoluted
as presented in Figure 1c,d. It represents the existence of metallic Bi peaks at 27.8 and
45.6° corresponding to the (012) and (006) planes. With gradual
increase in the loading amount of CdS QDs in Bi/Bi2MoO6, there is shifting of peaks to higher angles owing to the
synergistic interaction between CdS QDs and Bi/Bi2MoO6.16 Additionally, the loading amount
of CdS QDs could inhibit the crystal growth of Bi/Bi2MoO6, resulting in a weaker and broader peak.17

pattern showing peak position of both Bi and Bi2MoO6.

3.2 Optical
Studies
The optical absorption
properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated by UV–vis
diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) in the range of 200–800
nm. Figure 2a depicts
that photoabsorption of pure BMO, BBMO, and CBBMO composites reflects
in both UV and visible regions with strong light absorption between
300 and 700 nm. Its absorption range is also extended to near-IR region,
which is contributed to light scattering and SPR effects of Bi metal.11 It is also observed from Figure 2a that the absorbance spectra of BBMO and
CBBMO consist of one strong and one small shoulder band in the UV
region. The small shoulder band around 220–330 nm is attributed
to the interband transition from valence band (consists of O 2p orbitals)
to conduction band, which is made up of Mo 4d orbitals and Bi 6p orbitals.5 In addition to this, CdS QDs have high absorbance
value that shows strong absorption up to 580 nm and the steep shape
is due to band gap transitions.12 Moreover,
no distinct maxima is found, rather a plateau-shaped spectrum is observed,
which is attributed to different electronic structure. With increasing
the loading amount of CdS QDs, the optical absorption shifted toward
higher wavelength, which played a vital role in photocatalytic activity.
This broad absorption band is attributed to uniform particle size
distribution, and the red shift absorbance is attributed to the present
localized states.12 Also the observed red
shift is consistent with the change in color of photocatalysts from
deep gray to dark green. Consensus is that, on account of SPR effect,
Bi-modified nanocomposites show improved light absorption, which is
one of the important characteristics of enhanced photocatalytic activity.
The direct band gaps of CdS QDs and BMO are calculated by the equation
αhυ = K(hυ – Eg)1/2, where
the symbols bear their usual designations values, that is, “α”
is the absorption coefficient, hυ is the photon
energy, K is a constant, and Eg is the optical band gap energy. It should be mentioned here
that absorption coefficient (α) can be replaced by absorbance
(A) because the concentration (c) and the optical path length (l) are invariable
in the present situation.

(d) band gap of bismuth molybdate.

3.3 Calculation of Urbach Energy
Urbach
tail gives information about defects, disorder, band structure, and
electron–phonon interaction in almost all amorphous semiconductors,
degenerately doped crystalline materials, and in many ionic crystals
in the weak absorption or low-energy side of the optical spectra.
In Figure 2b, the absorption
coefficient follows an exponential change, and this type of exponential
decay is known as Urbach tail, which follows eq 1. 1  where α0 is a constant, E is the incident energy, and EU is the
Urbach energy.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides,
we have 2  From eq 2, the reciprocal of the slope of this exponential graph plotted
between ln α and incident energy (E)
determines the Urbach energy value (EU). Additionally, EU is an expected explanation
for density of states, especially in low-dimensional semiconductors
in a nonvacated environment.18−20 If the width of the exponential
tail is large, there is more density of defect states in the material,
which indicates fast recombination of charge carriers.18 So, to delay the recombination of charge carriers
and improve the photocatalytic application, it is important to find
a material having small Urbach energy (EU). Table 1 shows the
calculated Urbach energy and band gap values of all of the prepared
samples. From Table 1 and Figure 2b, it
is observed that CBBMO-3 has the lowest EU value among the prepared composites, which is an indication of containing
less density of states and have undergone delayed recombination of
photoexcited charge carriers. This characteristic property is also
in well agreement with the PL behavior of CBBMO-3, which is discussed
in the next section.

at Half-Maximum
(FWHM), and Urbach Energy of Prepared BBMO Samples
catalyst	band gap
(eV)	FWHM of PL peak (nm)	Urbach energy (eV)	
CBBMO-1	2.70	45.83	3.71	
CBBMO-3	2.65	44.99	2.56	
CBBMO-5	2.51	45.74	2.80	
3.4 Photoluminescence
Behavior
To provide
evidence about the transfer and degree of recombination of photoexcited
charge carriers in semiconductors, PL spectroscopy is proved to be
an effective method. As shown in Figure 3a, the prepared neat material and all of
the composites show a strong emission peak at ca. 415 nm and a small
peak at 468 nm. The former peak is due to defect-related luminescence
(blue luminescence), and the latter is because of band gap transition.
To acquire more information about the optoelectronic properties of
the as-synthesized samples, photoluminescence (PL) emission and photoluminescence
excitation (PLE) spectroscopy is performed in detail. In addition
to this, it is very clear from Figure 3a that CBBMO-3 shows the lowest PL intensity compared
to the other made composites, which is an indication of delayed recombination
of excited charge carriers and better photocatalytic activity of the
concerned sample. Figure 3b shows a comparison study between FWHM of PL emission peak
calculated from Figure 3a and Urbach energy calculated from absorption coefficient in the
previous section. It is clearly observed that both the factors follow
a similar trend with increasing loading amount of CdS QDs, which indicates
that the source of foundation of both absorption and emission ascends
from similar states.21 The FWHM and EU values of the prepared composites follow the
following order CBBMO-1 > CBBMO-5 > CBBMO-3. All of the values
of
calculated band gap, FWHM from PL peak, and Urbach energy are compiled
in Table 1. It is observed
from Table 1 that CBBMO-3
shows the least FWHM and Urbach energy compared to the CBBMO composites,
which indicates the low disorder among these. Uniform distribution
of QDs on BBMO surface is analyzed by varying different excitation
wavelengths in support of wavelength-dependent PL behavior of QDs.

spectra of BMO, BBMO, CdS QDs, and the prepared
composites at excitation wavelength of 330 nm; (b) comparison of change

of CBBMO-3 at excitation wavelengths of 320, 325, 330, 335, and 340
nm; and (d) normalized PLE spectra of CBBMO-3 at emission wavelengths
of 410, 415, 420, 425, and 430 nm.

Figure 3c,d
represents
PL and PLE spectra of CBBMO-3 at different excitation and emission
wavelengths, respectively. The observed data are presented in Table 2.

Table 2 Extracted Data from Figure 3c,da
fixed excitation	observed emission	fixed emission	observed excitation	
320	401.46	410	325.54	
325	408.89	415	329.98	
330	415.32	420	333.94	
335	419.76	425	338.16	
340	424.74	430	341.37	
a Note: All of the given data in this
table are in nanometer scale.

In Figure 3c, when
the excitation wavelengths are varied in the range of 320–340
nm at an interval of 5 nm, it has been observed that the emission
spectra are gradually and periodically shifted toward higher wavelength
(401.46–424.74 nm). On the contrary, when emission wavelengths
are varied in the range of 410–430 nm at the same interval,
PLE spectra are exhibited at the wavelength nearly same as that of
the fixed excitation wavelength, as mentioned in Figure 3c. From this analysis, the
Stokes shift is calculated to be 84 nm (Figure S1), which indicates the weak self-absorption and low energy
loss of the composites.22 Because the broad
symmetric emission peaks are not at constant wavelength when excited
with various excitation wavelengths, it can be suggested that the
CBBMO composites are not with a monodisperse set of CdS QDs.

3.5 SEM
The structure and morphology
of the BBMO and all of the prepared composites were investigated by
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As shown in Figure 4a,b, the microsphere
morphology of BBMO is clearly revealed with average particle size
of 1.5 μm and also with some interspaced nanoparticles of the
same. The interspaced nanoparticles are formed because of the reducing
agent taken (glucose). During the synthesis, although the amount of
glucose taken for the purpose of formation of microsphere morphology
of BBMO, still it has inhibited somehow the anisotropic development
of BBMO.11Figure 4c–h represents the distinctive SEM
images of all CBBMO composites, where the deposition of CdS QDs on
the surface of BBMO is clearly visible, which confirms the formation
of the QDs. In Figure 4c,d (magnified image), the deposition of the QDs is less noticeable
compared to other SEM images of CBBMO composites as a result of its
small loading amount (1 wt %). The deposition of CdS QDs on the BBMO
surface is more prominent in CBBMO-3 and CBBMO-5, as shown in Figure 4e–h. It is
observed from the SEM images of all of the CBBMO composites (Figure 4c–h) that
irregular spherical and apparent agglomerated QDs have partially covered
the BBMO surface.

CBBMO-1;
(e, f) CBBMO-3; and (g, h) CBBMO-5.

3.6 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The microsphere morphology of BBMO and ultrasmall particle size of
the as-prepared CdS QDs are clearly visible from the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images. Figure 5a represents the TEM image
and Figure 5b represents
the HRTEM image of microspherical BBMO, which is in resemblance with
the corresponding FESEM analysis. The d spacing value
mentioned in the figure corresponds to the (131) and (012) planes
of Bi2MoO6 and Bi, respectively. The ultrasmall
size of CdS QDs is confirmed from Figure 5c,d, which is representative of about 3.5
nm CdS QDs. The inset of Figure 5c clearly reveals the lattice spacing of CdS QDs, which
corresponds to (111) crystal plane (0.33 nm). All of these obtained
values of d spacing are in well coincidence with
the XRD analysis. The TEM image of composite CBBMO-3 is represented
in Figure 5e. The coexistence
of Bi2MoO6, Bi, and CdS QDs is evidenced from
the HRTEM image (Figure 5f).

3.7 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
To explore the chemical
composition and mode of molecular vibration,
FTIR spectra of BBMO and CBBMO catalysts were analyzed in the range
of 4000–400 cm–1, which is demonstrated in Figure 6. The peak at 448
cm–1 is the representative peak for Bi–O
stretching vibrational modes, and the band at 584 cm–1 is the bending vibration mode of MoO6 octahedron.23 The peaks positioned at 796 and 842 cm–1 can be correspondingly ascribed to the symmetric and asymmetric
Mo–O stretching vibration modes of the corner sharing MoO6 octahedron.24 The peak retained
at 2360 cm–1 is attributed to the antisymmetrical
stretching mode of carbon dioxide.25 Peaks
centered at 1620 and 3415 cm–1 correspond to H–O–H
bending and O–H stretching vibration modes of absorbed free
water.26 As the prepared QDs
are capped with thioglycolic acid (TGA), the C–O stretching
is observed in the range of 990–1150 and the peaks at 400–700
cm–1 are attributed to Cd–S stretching.27 It should be mentioned here that the S–H
stretching at 2550–2970 cm–1 is absent in
TGA-capped CdS QDs, which is due to the covalent bonding between thiols
and Cd atom of CdS QDs.28 The FTIR spectra
for pure TGA and TGA-capped CdS QDs are given in Figure S2.

Figure 6 FTIR spectra of BBMO and the prepared composites.

3.8 Chemical
Composition
The XPS analysis
represents the surface chemical composition of CBBMO-3 composite.
The presence of constituent elements, i.e., Bi, Mo, O, Cd, and S,
is confirmed from the survey scan (Figure 7a). As shown in Figure 7b, two high-resolution and strong peaks are
centered at 159.2 and 164.5 eV, which are due to 4f7/2 and
4f5/2, respectively, of Bi3+. In addition to
these two peaks, other two peaks at 156.7 and 162.4 eV are obtained,
which confirms the metallic state of Bi.11Figure 7c reveals
that peaks at 232.5 and 235. 6 eV correspond to 3d5/2 and
3d3/2 of Mo6+ oxidation state in CBBMO-3.29 The symmetric peak at 530.5 eV (O 1s) is attributed
to Bi–O chemical bonding. Two peaks at 405.3 and 412.2 eV are
ascribed to Cd5/2 and Cd3/2, respectively, and
confirm the +2 state of Cd (Figure 7e). The presence of S at the junction is also proved
from Figure 7f.30

3.9 Photoelectrochemical Analysis
Mott–Schottky
(MS) analysis, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy of BBMO and CBBMO composites were investigated to conclude
the high performance toward electrochemical properties. Generally,
the band edge position as well as the type of semiconductor, the photocurrent
response, the charge carrier separation or transport, etc. are being
examined from these above-mentioned analysis.

3.9.1 Mott–Schottky
Analysis
To
check the photocatalytic activity of the prepared composite toward
degradation of phenol and reduction of hexavalent chromium, favorable
band alignment is necessary for the flow of charge carriers and formation
of the active radicals. To evaluate experimentally the band edge positions,
Mott–Schottky analysis is carried out, and the Mott–Schottky
plots of bare bismuth molybdate (BMO) and CdS QDs are given in Figure 8a,b.

Figure 8 Mott–Schottky
plots of (a) BMO and (b) CdS QDs.

The graph is plotted by taking inverse of the square of measured
space charge capacitance (CSC) in unit
of Farad (F) as ordinate and the applied potential (Vapp) in volt (V) as abscissa using the following equation
(eq 3). 3  where Vfb is the flat band potential,
which is calculated by the extrapolation of the graph and intersection
point of abscissa, and k, T, e, ND, ε, ε0, and A are the Boltzmann constant in J K–1, absolute temperature in K, electronic charge in
C, donor density in cm3, semiconductor dielectric constant,
dielectric constant in vacuum, and area in cm2, respectively.
The slope of this equation can also be helpful in calculating the
value of ND if the values of ε and A are known. The positive slope of the plot reveals the
obvious n-type behavior for both BMO and CdS QDs, and the intersection
point is independent of applied frequency. It is very well known that
the Mott–Schottky plot is representative of the flat band potential
of the semiconductor. Negative flat band potential of −0.86
and −0.63 V versus Ag/AgCl is found for both BMO and CdS QDs.
The flat band potential in NHE scale is calculated to be −0.31
and −0.08 V for BMO and CdS QDs, respectively. As the conduction
band of n-type semiconductors is 0.1 V more negative than the flat
band potential,31 the CB edge potential
of BMO and CdS are at −0.40 and −0.18 V (vs NHE). Hence,
the valence band potential of BMO and CdS QDs is calculated to be
+2.08 and +2.11 V, respectively.

3.9.2 Linear
Sweep Voltammetry
The typical
n-type behavior is represented here from the increasing anodic current
density, which has been increased with applied positive potential.
As shown in Figure 9a, under dark condition, BBMO shows 0.14 mA/cm2 of photocurrent
density, and there is enhancement of the photocurrent value in case
of CBBMO composites. With the increase of loading content of CdS QDs
from CBBMO-1 to CBBMO-3, there is a steady enhancement of photocurrent
density, but after that, 5 wt % loading amount of CdS QDs inhibits
the increment of photocurrent generation.

Figure 9 J–E curves under (a) dark
and (b) light conditions of BBMO and CBBMO composites coated on FTO
measured in 0.1 M Na2SO4.

Under dark condition, maximum 0.58 mA/cm2 of current
was generated by CBBMO-3 composite. But the CBBMO-3 photoanode under
front-side photoillumination could generate 0.8 mA/cm2 of
current at the applied potential.

3.9.3 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
Figure 10 shows
the Nyquist plot (Zimg vs Zreal), which is a measure of intrinsic electrical properties,
especially conductivity. The idea about conductivity or charge-transfer
resistance can be easily best evaluated from the radius of the semicircle.
The smaller the radius of semicircle, the better is the conductivity
of the semiconductor, which is CBBMO-3 in our case. This is also well
supported by the catalytic activity, which will be discussed later.
The values of charge-transfer resistance of the prepared samples follow
the order: CBBMO-3 (50.00 Ω) < CBBMO-5 (51.22 Ω) <
CBBMO-1 (52.34 Ω) < BBMO (58.74 Ω). The plot was fitted
with the circuit model, which consists of Rs, Rct, Ws, and CPE, where Rs is the ohmic series
resistance (charge-transfer resistance and contact resistance at electrolyte/electrode), Rct is the electron-transfer resistance for the
reaction, Ws is the Warburg resistance,
and CPE is the constant phase element.

and CBBMO composites in the frequency range

3.10 Determination of Point of Zero Charge
The surface charge is a key point in the reduction of Cr(VI) as Cr
species in anionic form get attracted by the catalyst surface. For
this, the catalyst surface should be positively charged and hence
to determine the surface charge of catalyst, drift method15 is used. This method is useful to calculate
the point of zero charge (PZC) of prepared samples. The typical procedure
involves the preparation of 0.005 M NaCl aqueous solution, followed
by boiling to remove dissolved CO2. The pH of the solution
was maintained at 2, 4, 6, and 8 by 0.5 M HCl and 0.5 M NaOH. In the
next step, 20 mL of the above-prepared solution with 0.02 g of CBBMO-3
was stirred for 24 h to attain the adsorption–desorption equilibrium.
Then, the final pH of a required solution is plotted against the pH
of the solution before treatment. This graph (Figure 11) results a pH value of pHinitial = pHfinal, which is called the point of zero charge (pHPZC). The consensus is that if the pH is less than the pHPZC, the surface of catalyst is positively charged, and if
the pH succeeds pHPZC, the surface becomes negatively charged.15

Figure 11 Drift method of calculation of pHPZC of CBBMO-3.

4 Photocatalytic
Activity
4.1 Photocatalytic Reduction of Cr(VI)
Due to the wide-range light absorption ability and photostability
of CBBMO, it was utilized to reduce toxic Cr(VI). Its photocatalytic
nature was due to certain control experimental conditions. During
the reaction, there is no significant reduction of Cr(VI) in the absence
of either light or catalyst (Figure 12a), which confirms the admirable stability of K2Cr2O7 solution. As shown in Figure 12a, 20 and 82% reduction
was observed by neat BBMO and CdS QDs, respectively. Interestingly,
the rate of reduction was greatly enhanced after loading of CdS QDs
on BBMO. It was observed that by the end of the reaction period, CBBMO-3
could reduce 97% of hexavalent Cr in 1 h. The Cr remediation efficiencies
of the other prepared composites are 86, 97, and 90% over CBBMO-1,
CBBMO-3, and CBBMO-5, respectively. This result shows the best photocatalytic
activity of CBBMO-3 toward the photocatalytic reduction of hexavalent
Cr in comparison to the other reported work (Table 3). The spectral changes during the removal
of Cr(VI) over all prepared catalysts were tested at various intervals
of time and are represented in Figure 12b.

reduction of Cr(VI) over CBBMO-3 at various intervals of time; and
(c) spectral changes during reduction of Cr(VI) at different pHs.

4.1.1 Effect of pH on Cr(VI) Reduction
pH plays a very essential role in the reduction of hexavalent Cr;
hence, to investigate its influence, a series of experiments were
performed at pHs 2, 4, 6, and 8. The pictorial representation is shown
in Figure 12c, which
indicates that the suitable pH value is 2. On this basis, the entire
experiment toward photocatalytic removal of Cr(VI) was carried out
at pH 2. The lower pH value is maintained as reaction condition because,
at this pH, Cr is predominantly present in anionic form, i.e., as
Cr2O72–, and it is quite less
than the pHPZC value (pHPZC = 6.8). As mentioned
earlier, if the pH is less than pHPZC, the CBBMO surface
is positively charged, resulting in effective interaction between
catalyst surface and Cr2O72–, which is a suitable condition for the removal of hexavalent Cr.
The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) proceeds as per the following equation. 4  From this equation, it is clear that due to
plethora of protons available the photocatalytic activity is encouraged
at lower pH.

4.1.2 Confirmation of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III)
After the experiment, Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III),
and this was
analyzed by KMnO4. To verify the existence of nontoxic
Cr(III), KMnO4 solution was used to oxidize Cr(III) back
to Cr(VI), which was confirmed colorimetrically by the DPC method.15 In a typical experiment, 0.02 M KMnO4 aqueous solution was prepared, 0.1 mL of which was added to 1.9
mL of the residual solution after irradiated with sunlight for 1 h,
and the same DPC method was used for the detection of concentration
for Cr(VI). From the above experiment, it is clear that Cr(VI) is
reduced to Cr(III).

4.2 Detection of Active Species
As it
is known that electrons in CB of catalysts are the active species
for Cr(VI) reduction, to prove this, methanol can be used as hole
scavenger, which reacts with the photoinduced holes in the VB of the
catalysts to achieve fast photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). The
typical procedure involves addition of various amounts of CH3OH and citric acid to the acidic Cr(VI) solution at pH 2.

Figure 13a depicts that
the addition of methanol decreases the photoreduction time and makes
it a fast photocatalytic removal of hexavalent Cr. In addition to
methanol, 1 mL of aqueous citric acid solution (1 g/10 mL) was also
used to completely reduce Cr(VI) within 40 min. Complete reduction
of Cr(VI) was observed in 20 min when both methanol (2 mL) and citric
acid (1 mL) were in the reaction medium. This suggests that the main
active species may be electron; this statement has also been proved
by taking various amounts of AgNO3 and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) as electron scavenger, as shown in Figure 13b. As shown in the figure, 0.2 mmol AgNO3 shows higher electron-trapping capacity than 0.3 and 0.4
mmol AgNO3. But, it was observed that the electron-trapping
ability of DMSO is higher compared to AgNO3. It was studied
experimentally that 4 mM DMSO is sufficient compared to 3 and 5 mM
DMSO to scavenge the photoexcited electrons. Still some reduction
occurred, which will be discussed in Section 4.4.

(a) hole and
(b) electron scavengers.

4.2.1 Kinetics Followed by CBBMO-3 in Cr(VI) Reduction
Zero-order kinetics (Figure 14) was followed by CBBMO for the reduction of Cr(VI),
which was concluded by fitting the experimental data with zero-, first-,
and second-order kinetics model equations (eqs 5–7). The obtained
fitting results, i.e., slope (rate constant, k),
coefficient of determination, R2, and
standard error, are tabulated in Table 4. 5   6   7  Here, C0 and C are concentrations of Cr(VI) at time
= 0 and t, respectively, in mg/L, and k0, k1, and k2 are zero-,
first-, and second-order rate constants in mg/L min, min–1, and L/mg min, respectively.

4.3 Photocatalytic Degradation of Phenol
The
versatile photocatalytic activity of CBBMO samples was investigated
by degrading 10 ppm phenol as model organic environmental pollutant. Figure 15a shows spectral
presentation of phenol degradation under solar light irradiation,
and it was measured by a UV–vis spectrometer at ca. 269 nm.
The effect of pH was also checked in this process, and pH 6 was found
to be a suitable condition for the degradation. The degradation activity
follows the sequence as pH 6 > pH 2 > pH 4 > pH 8 (Figure 15b). So, pH 6 was
taken as
the optimum pH condition to carry out further experiment, and 47.5%
phenol was degraded in the presence of CBBMO-3 under solar light in
60 min.

Figure 15 (a) Absorption spectra of prepared catalysts in phenol degradation;
(b) comparison of rate of degradation of phenol by CBBMO-3 at different
pHs; (c) second-order kinetics observed in the degradation process;
and (d) histogram representing the comparison of second-order rate
constants of prepared samples at pH 6.

The kinetics through which the phenol degradation mechanism
was
performed is shown in Figure 15c. The kinetics process involves 0.02 g of CBBMO-3 at pH 6,
and the same procedure was surveyed to investigate the kinetics. Results
showed that it is the second-order kinetics followed by the degradation
process. The symbols in this equation bear their usual meaning. Figure 15d indicates the
second-order rate constants; when examined, it was observed that CBBMO-3
possesses a higher rate constant of 0.014 L/mg min, which is 14 and
7 times higher than that of the CBBMO-1 (0.001 L/mg min) and CBBMO-5
(0.002 L/mg min) composites, respectively. The conclusion drawn from
the observation is that CBBMO-3 catalyst accelerates the photodegradation
of 10 ppm phenol compared to all other prepared samples.

4.4 Mechanism Involved in Cr(VI) Reduction and
Phenol Degradation
All of the above experimental procedure
directs the following acceptable mechanistic pathway for the reduction
of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol, which is embodied in Scheme 1. CdS QDs and Bi
in CBBMO-3 act here as the absorption center due to their high absorption
capacity and SPR property, respectively. In addition to this, the
obtained Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area data
of the as-prepared samples (Table S1 of
SI) and their respective photocatalytic activities signify that surface
area is not the whole criteria in deciding the efficiency of photocatalysts.38 Rather than charge separation efficiency, light
absorption capacity, band gap, band edge potential, active sites,
and photostability are key factors in determining the photocatalytic
efficiency of the material.

Scheme 1 Schematic Presentation of Reduction
of Cr(VI) and Degradation of
Phenol over CBBMO-3
Upon solar light irradiation, photoinduced electrons and
holes
get separated. As a result of this, holes are in VB, whereas electrons
are in CB of BBMO and CdS QDs. As per the CB edge positions of involved
semiconductors, electrons
migrate from CB of both BMO and CdS QDs to Fermi level of Bi (−0.17
V),11 meanwhile holes transfer from VB
of BMO to CdS QDs and eventually oxidize the hole scavenger (methanol,
citric acid) to CO2, H2O, and other mineralized
products. At the surface of Bi, some migrated electrons are utilized
to reduce Cr(VI) as per eq 4 and some electrons are engaged in the production of superoxide
radicals (•O2–), which indirectly reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) through a two-step process.39 As E0 (O2/•O2) = −0.046 eV versus NHE,39 which is less negative than the CB potential
value of BMO, CdS QDs, and Bi, electrons are transferred to generate •O2–. This
mechanism is proposed because even in the presence of DMSO (e– scavenger), CBBMO-3 could reduce 60% Cr(VI); hence,
it is supposed that •O2– is also participating in Cr(VI) reduction. The generation of •O2– is confirmed from
the NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium chloride) test.40 In CBBMO-3, less •O2– are formed compared to the neat materials, which is confirmed from
the high absorbance value from Figure 16a. So, partial involvement of •O2– is confirmed
from this NBT test.

Figure 16 Absoption spectra of (a) NBT in neat and CBBMO-3 sample
and (b)
fluorescence spectra of BBMO and CBBMO-3 in basic solution of 5 ×
10–5 M terephthalic acid.

From the scavenger test of phenol, it was concluded that
the major
active species behind this is •OH and
the minor species is •O2–. In neutral and basic medium, •O2– formation is favorable, whereas
the formation of H2O• is
favorable in acidic medium. Both the species are responsible for the
generation of •OH radical.35 The confirmation of production of these radicals
is graphically presented in Figure 16a,b. The formation and role of •O2– is similar in this regard,
as explained previously. The formation of •OH radical might be proposed in two ways. One is direct formation
from holes at VB of CdS QDs because E0 (OH–/•OH) = 1.99
versus NHE32 and the other is indirect
formation via H2O2, as proposed in the following
equations.                The resultant degradation reaction is phenol
+ •O2– + •OH → degradation

4.5 Stability and Reusability of CBBMO Composite
For the
practical application (wastewater remediation) of this
catalyst, the stability must be retained so that it can be reused
several times. Figure 17 shows the repeated use of this catalyst up to five cycles of Cr(VI)
reduction and phenol degradation. Average reduction and
degradation of Cr(VI) and phenol of 95.76 and 47% are maintained,
respectively, for five cycles. CBBMO-3 obtained after Cr(VI) reduction
was characterized by FTIR analysis, and it is very prominent from Figure 18a that there is
shifting of peak toward lower wavenumber. This is an indication of
good interaction between CBBMO-3 and Cr(VI). Even after five cycles
of treatment in Cr(VI), the characteristic peaks still persist. Additionally,
UV-DRS spectra (Figure 18b) are also provided here, which conclude little change in
absorption region after reduction of Cr(VI).

phenol degradation efficiency versus reaction
cycles of CBBMO-3.

5 Conclusions
A systematic methodology
has been followed to evaluate the versatile
photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared composite (CBBMO-3) for
Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation. Comparative study of using
different hole scavengers has also been investigated, which significantly
reduces the reaction time to achieve the target. The zero- and second-order
kinetics are followed by reduction of Cr species and degradation of
phenol, respectively. Cr(VI) removal and phenol degradation efficiencies
are found to be 97 and 47.5%, respectively, over CBBMO-3. From the
scavenger test, electron is found to be the main key active species, •O2– is partially
involved in the reduction of Cr(VI), and the lion’s share goes
to both •O2– and •OH in the degradation of phenol.
The present work suggests that low-cost Bi acts as a substitute for
noble metals and CdS QDs greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity.
This work possibly provides industrial applications toward removal
of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol.
