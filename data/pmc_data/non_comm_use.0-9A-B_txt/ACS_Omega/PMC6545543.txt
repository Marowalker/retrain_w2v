The
primary objective of this article is to gain fundamental insights
into the dependences of component permeances Πi in microporous membranes on the operating conditions (upstream
partial pressures, temperature, and feed composition). It is argued
that the permeances Πi for unary
systems and mixtures need to be compared on the basis of the adsorption
potential πA/RT, a convenient
and practical proxy for the spreading pressure π that is calculable
using the ideal adsorbed solution theory for mixture adsorption equilibrium.
The use of πA/RT as a yardstick
serves to elucidate and rationalize a wide variety of published experimental
Πi data on unary and mixture permeances
in microporous membranes. For cage-type host structures such as SAPO-34,
DDR, and ZIF-8, the Πi values are
uniquely dictated by the magnitude of πA/RT, irrespective of the partner species in the mixture.
For MFI membranes, the tardier species slows down the more mobile
partners due to correlated molecular motion within the channels; the
degree of correlation is also a function of πA/RT.

1 Introduction
Membrane technologies find applications in a variety of separation
applications such as gas separations and water/alcohol pervaporation.1,2 The permselective membrane layers often consist of microporous materials
such as zeolites (aluminosilicates), metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), or carbon molecular
sieves.3−16 Experimental data on membrane permeation are most commonly presented
in terms of the component permeances defined by 1  where Ni is the permeation flux and pi0 – piδ is the difference in the partial
pressures at the upstream
(subscript 0) and downstream (subscript δ) faces of the membrane
layer of thickness δ. The permeance of any guest species is
influenced by a variety of factors such as the connectivity and pore
topology of the microporous host material, operating conditions (temperature,
pressure, and feed mixture composition), and the choice of the partner
species in the mixture. The pore landscapes of four important host
materials CHA, DDR, ZIF-8, and MFI that have membrane applications
are shown in Figure 1. CHA zeolite consists of cages of 316 Å3 volume,
separated by 8-ring windows of 3.8 Å × 4.2 Å size.
DDR zeolite has cages of 278 Å3 volume, separated
by 8-ring windows of 3.65 Å × 4.37 Å size. ZIF-8 has
an SOD (sodalite) topology, consisting of cages of 1168 Å3 volume, separated by 3.3 Å windows; the windows are
flexible. MFI zeolite consists of a set of intersecting straight channels
and zigzag (or sinusoidal) channels of 5.5 Å size.

Figure 1 Pore landscapes
of (a) CHA, (b) DDR, (c) ZIF-8, and (d) MFI zeolite,
along with computational snapshots of guest molecules.

Figure 2a,b presents
experimental data for permeances of CO2 and H2 determined for unary and mixture permeation across the SAPO-34 membrane.
SAPO-34 has the same structural topology as CHA zeolite. Compared
at the same partial pressures, the H2 permeance is significantly
reduced due to the presence of partner species CO2, CH4, and N2; the reduction is significantly higher
with CO2 as a partner. In sharp contrast, CO2 permeance is only marginally influenced by the presence and choice
of the partner species in the mixtures: CH4, N2, and H2.

Figure 2 (a,b) Experimental data of Li et al.41−43 for permeances
of (a)
CO2 and (b) H2 determined for unary and equimolar
binary mixture permeation across the SAPO-34 membrane at 295 K. The x axis represents the partial pressures in the feed mixture
in the upstream membrane compartment.

Figure 3a
compares
the experimental data on permeances of CO2 and H2 determined for unary and binary mixture permeation across an MFI
membrane. The CO2 and H2 mixture permeances
are both lower than the corresponding values for unary systems when
compared at the same partial pressures in the upstream compartment.
For H2, the more mobile guest, the lowering is by about
1 order of magnitude, while the permeance of the tardier CO2 is lowered by a factor of about 2. The data based on unary permeation
anticipates H2-selective separation whereas the data for
mixture permeation displays CO2-selective separations.

Figure 3 (a) Experimental
data of Sandström et al.44 for the
component permeances for unary species and 50:50
CO2/H2 feed mixtures across the MFI membrane
at 296 K. (b) Experimental data of van de Graaf et al.45 for component permeances of CH4/C2H6 and CH4/C3H8 mixtures in the MFI membrane at 303 K. (c) Experimental data of
Vroon et al.46 for unary and 50:50 CH4/n-C4H10 mixture permeation
across the MFI membrane at a total pressure of 100 kPa and varying
temperatures.

Consider the experimental
data for permeation of CH4/C2H6 and
CH4/C3H8 mixtures across an MFI membrane
at 303 K presented in Figure 3b. The two sets of
experimental permeance data are plotted as functions of the mole fraction
of the more mobile guest, CH4, in the feed gas mixture
in the upstream compartment. Increasing the proportion of the tardier
component C2H6 in the CH4/C2H6 feed mixture has the effect of progressively reducing
the permeance of the more mobile CH4 by up to an order
of magnitude. The reduction of CH4 permeance is significantly
higher, by up to 2 orders of magnitude, for CH4/C3H8 mixture permeation.

For 50:50 CH4/n-C4H10 mixture permeation across
an MFI membrane, the experimental
data show that the reduction of CH4 permeance due to the
presence of the tardier partner n-C4H10 is considerably more significant at lower temperatures (see Figure 3c). As the temperature
is increased, the component permeances become closer in values.

The experimental data for permeation of mixtures of n-hexane (nC6) and 2,2-dimethylbutane (22DMB) across
an MFI membrane are remarkable in that the permeance of the tardier
22DMB is further reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude by the
presence of the more mobile nC6 partner (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 Experimental data of
Gump et al.47 for
unary and 50:50 nC6/22DMB mixture permeances across
the MFI membrane M2 at 398 K.

The wide variety of characteristics of membrane permeances
witnessed
in Figures 2–4 is a reflection of a combination of mixture adsorption
equilibrium and mixture diffusion. The mixture adsorption equilibrium
dictates the component loadings within the membrane layer; the component
loadings, in turn, affect the guest mobilities, and slowing-down,
or correlation, effects that often influence mixture permeation.17−20 The primary objective of this article is to gain fundamental insights
into the characteristics of unary and mixture permeances. Specifically,
we aim to show that the fundamentally appropriate choice of the x axes in Figures 2–4 is the spreading pressure
π calculated by use of the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)
of Myers and Prausnitz21 for mixture adsorption.
We shall demonstrate that the spreading pressure not only is a reflection
of mixture adsorption equilibrium but also dictates the loading dependence
of the guest diffusivities and correlation effects.20

2 Methodology for Modeling of Mixture Adsorption
and Diffusion
2.1 IAST for Mixture Adsorption
Equilibrium
Within microporous crystalline host materials,
the guest constituent
molecules exist entirely in the adsorbed phase. The Gibbs adsorption
equation in differential form is22−24 2  

In eq 2, A represents
the surface area per kilogram of the framework, qi is the molar loading, μi is the molar chemical potential, and π is the spreading pressure.
At phase equilibrium, equating the component chemical potentials μi in the adsorbed phase and in the bulk gas phase
mixture in the upstream membrane compartment, we write 3  

Briefly, the basic equation of the IAST theory
is the analogue
of Raoult’s law for vapor–liquid equilibrium, that is 4  where xi is the mole fraction in the adsorbed phase defined by 5  and Pi0 is the pressure for sorption of every component i, which yields the same spreading pressure, π, for
each of
the pure components, as that for the mixture: 6  

In eq 6, qi0(f) is the pure component
adsorption isotherm.
Since the surface area A is not directly accessible
from experimental data, the adsorption potential πA/RT, with a unit of mole per kilogram, serves as
a convenient and practical proxy for the spreading pressure π.
For the simple case of a binary mixture in which each isotherm is
described by the single-site Langmuir model with equal saturation
capacities for each constituent 7  the following explicit expression
can be derived 8  

For the more general case in which the saturation
capacities of
the constituents are unequal, the entire set of equations must be
solved numerically. The unary isotherm data for all guest/host combinations
analyzed in this article, along with the numerical details for determination
of πA/RT, are provided in
the Supporting Information.

2.2 Maxwell–Stefan Description of Mixture
Diffusion
The Maxwell–Stefan (M–S) approach
is the most convenient and practical formulation that relates the
molar permeation fluxes to the gradients of the molar chemical potential
of the guest constituents.20,25−27 For binary mixtures, the M–S equations are 9  where ρ represents the
framework density of the microporous crystalline material. The Đ1 and Đ2 characterize the guest–wall interactions. The exchange coefficient Đ12 reflects how the facility for transport
of species i correlates with that of species j. The ratios Đ1/Đ12 and Đ2/Đ12 quantify the degrees of correlation.
The magnitude of Đ1, relative to
that of Đ12, determines the extent
to which the flux of species 1 is influenced by the chemical potential
gradient of species 2. The larger is the degree of correlation, Đ1/Đ12, the stronger is the influence of diffusional “coupling”.

The persuasive advantage of using the M–S formulation is
that the M–S diffusivities Đi can be identified with the corresponding diffusivities for unary
systems provided that the values are determined at the same adsorption
potential πA/RT; this has
been established in earlier work20 with
the aid of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a vast number of
mixture diffusion in several zeolites and MOFs. As illustrated, Figure 5a compares the M–S
diffusivity Đi of CO2 determined for MD simulation data for diffusion of equimolar (q1 = q2) CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 mixtures in MFI zeolite with the corresponding unary
diffusivity. Compared at the same value of πA/RT, the M–S diffusivities Đi have practically the same value, confirming that
the adsorption potential is the correct yardstick to compare diffusivities.
To rationalize the lowering of the M–S diffusivity with increasing
values of πA/RT, we plot in Figure 5b the diffusivity
data as a function of the fractional occupancy θ determined
from 10  

Figure 5 (a,b) Maxwell–Stefan diffusivity Đi of CO2 determined for MD
simulation data20 for diffusion of a variety
of equimolar (q1 = q2) CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 mixtures in MFI zeolite at 300
K plotted as a function
of the (a) adsorption potential πA/RT and (b) the occupancy θ. Also shown in open symbols
are the MD simulations of Đi for
unary CO2 diffusion. (c) MD simulation data20 for degree of correlations Đ1/Đ12 for equimolar
(q1 = q2)
CO2/H2, CO2/CH4, CO2/N2, CH4/C2H6,
CH4/C3H8, and CH4/n-C4H10 mixtures in MFI zeolite at
300 K. (d) MD simulation data20 for degree
of correlations Đ2/Đ12 for equimolar (q1 = q2) CO2/H2 mixtures in
MFI, MgMOF-74, and LTA at 300 K.

For a binary mixture, the saturation capacity qsat is defined as follows20 11  

Increasing the fractional occupancy lowers the values of Đi because the channels of MFI become increasingly
crowded; indeed, Đi → 0 as
θ → 1 for all guest species. For binary mixtures in which
the unary isotherms are described by eq 7, eqs 10 and 11 are simplified to yield 12  

The simplest model to describe the occupancy dependence is
indicated
by the dashed line in Figure 5b 13  where Đi(0) is the M–S diffusivity at “zero
loading”. Equation 13 is essentially based on a simple hopping model in which a
molecule can jump from one adsorption site to an adjacent one, provided
that it is not already occupied.28,29 Using a simple
two-dimensional square lattice model, the M–S diffusivity in
the limit of vanishingly small occupancies is , where ζ = 4 is the coordination
number of the 2D array of lattice sites, λ is the jump distance
on the square lattice, and νi(0)
is the jump frequency at a vanishingly small occupancy.29 More generally, molecule–molecule interactions
serve to influence the jump frequencies by a factor that depends on
the energy of interaction w. For repulsive interactions, w > 0, whereas for attractive interactions, w < 0. The quasichemical approach of Reed and Ehrlich30 can be used to quantify such interactions.29,31,32

The implication of the
plots in Figure 5a,b
is that πA/RT and θ
are the appropriate thermodynamic measures
of the loadings within the pores of microporous materials.

MD
simulation data20 for several mixture/host
combinations also show that the degree of correlation increases with
pore occupancy, practically linearly, as illustrated in Figure 5c for binary mixtures in MFI
zeolite. For CO2/H2 mixtures, the degrees of
correlation for MFI, MgMOF-74, and LTA are compared in Figure 5d. For LTA with narrow windows
separating adjacent cages, the degree of correlation is significantly
lower than those for MFI and MgMOF-74.

From the IAST and M–S
theories, it emerges that the adsorption
potential πA/RT not only encapsulates
mixture adsorption equilibrium but also serves as the proper measure
of the loading dependence of the M–S diffusivities Đ1 and Đ2 and the degree of correlation Đ1/ Đ12. We should therefore expect
πA/RT to be the correct yardstick
to compare component permeances for unary and mixture permeation in Figures 2–4.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Permeation across SAPO-34, DDR, and ZIF-8
Membranes
Figure 6 presents plots of the component permeances for CO2 and H2 determined for unary and equimolar binary mixture
permeation across the SAPO-34 membrane at 295 K, plotted as a function
of πA/RT calculated at the
upstream face of the membrane, in equilibrium with the feed mixture
in the upstream compartment. The CO2 and H2 permeances
appear to be uniquely dependent on the adsorption potential and are
independent of the partner species. The reasons for this simple and
convenient finding are threefold: (i) the mixture adsorption equilibrium
between the feed mixture and the upstream face of the membrane is
properly quantified by the choice of πA/RT as x axes, (ii) the loading dependence
of the diffusivities is also described by πA/RT, and (iii) the correlation effects are of negligible
importance in SAPO-34 because the guest molecules jump one at a time
across the narrow windows, resulting in Đ1/Đ12 → 0 as evidenced
by MD data.17−20

Figure 6 Experimental
data of Li et al.41−43 for permeances of (a)
CO2 and (b) H2 determined for unary and equimolar
binary mixture permeation across the SAPO-34 membrane at 295 K. The x axes in panels (a) and (b) represent the adsorption potential,
corresponding to the conditions at the upstream face of the membrane.

In Figure 7a–c,
the experimental data on component permeances for 50:50 CO2/CH4 and 50:50 N2/CH4 mixture permeation
across a DDR membrane are plotted as a function of the adsorption
potential at the upstream face of the membrane. The intercage hopping
of guest molecules is uncorrelated, and there are no slowing-down
effects experienced by the more mobile partner species. The component
permeances in the mixture have the same values as those in the corresponding
unary systems. The CH4 permeance is independent of the
choice of CO2 or N2 as a partner in the mixture
(see Figure 7c).

Figure 7 (a–c)
Experimental data of Van den Bergh et al.48,49 for component permeances for 50:50 CO2/CH4 and 50:50 N2/CH4 binary mixture permeation
across the DDR membrane at 303 K. The x axes in panels
(a), (b), and (c) represent the adsorption potential, corresponding
to the conditions at the upstream face of the membrane.

Experimental data for component permeances for
50:50 C3H6/C3H8 binary
mixture permeation
across the ZIF-8 membrane at 308 K have practically the same magnitudes
as the corresponding unary permeances when compared at the same πA/RT at the upstream face of the membrane
(see Figure 8). The
explanation is precisely analogous to that for SAPO-34 and DDR membranes.

Figure 8 Experimental
data of Liu et al.50 for
component permeances for 50:50 C3H6/C3H8 binary mixture permeation across the ZIF-8 membrane
at 308 K, compared to unary permeation data. The data are plotted
as a function of adsorption potential πA/RT at the upstream face of the membrane.

3.2 Permeation across an MFI
Membrane
Correlation or slowing-down effects are of significant
importance
for guest diffusion in MFI zeolite, as has been established by MD
simulations17−20 (see data on degrees of correlation in Figure 5c,d). Consequently, the permeance of more
mobile partners should be expected to be lowered due to correlated
jumps with the tardier partner species within the pores. Figure 9a,b compares the
component permeances of 50:50 CO2/H2 feed mixtures
in the MFI membrane with the corresponding values for the unary species.
Also shown by continuous solid lines are the estimations using the
M–S model.19 In the model calculations,
the occupancy dependence of each guest is assumed to follow eq 13 wherein the zero-loading
diffusivities are fitted from the unary permeance data: ρĐ1(0)/δ = 3.2 and ρĐ2(0)/δ = 100 kg m–2 s–1. The degree of correlation is taken to increase
linearly with occupancy θ. The H2 permeance is significantly
influenced by correlation effects, as evidenced in Figure 9b for calculations with Đ2/Đ12 = 1.0θ, 3.0θ, and 10.0θ; the choice Đ2/Đ12 = 10.0θ
affords the best match with experimental data and is also in accordance
with the MD data in Figure 5d.

Figure 9 (a,b) Experimental data of Sandström et al.44 for component permeances in 50:50 CO2/H2 feed mixtures across the MFI membrane at 296 K compared with
the estimates using the M–S model (indicated by the continuous
solid lines). The x axes represent the adsorption
potential, corresponding to the conditions at the upstream face of
the membrane.

Figure 10a,b compares
the permeances for (a) CH4/C2H6 and
(b) CH4/C3H8 mixtures in MFI with
the corresponding values for unary systems as a function of πA/RT. For both mixtures, the permeances
of the more strongly adsorbed but tardier components in the two mixtures,
C2H6 and C3H8, are practically
the same as the unary values. The permeance of the more mobile CH4 is reduced significantly below the unary values due to two
separate reasons: (i) the M–S diffusivity of CH4 reduces with increasing values of πA/RT20 and (ii) the CH4 mobility in the intersecting channel structures is strongly correlated
with those of the tardier partners C2H6 and
C3H8. The correlation effects increase with
increasing values of πA/RT, as evidenced in the MD simulation data in Figure 5c. It is also noteworthy that the degree
of correlations for CH4/C3H8 mixtures
is higher than that for CH4/C2H6;
this rationalizes the stronger reduction in the CH4 permeance
due to partnership with C3H8.

Figure 10 Experimental data of
van de Graaf et al.45 for component permeances
of (a) CH4/C2H6 and (b) CH4/C3H8 mixtures
in MFI membrane at 303 K. (c) Experimental data of Vroon et al.46 for 50:50 CH4/n-C4H10 mixture permeation across the MFI membrane
at a total pressure of 100 kPa and varying temperatures. The x axes in panels (a), (b), and (c) represent the adsorption
potential, corresponding to the conditions at the upstream face of
the membrane.

The influence of the
operating temperature for CH4/n-C4H10 mixture permeation across
the MFI membrane (cf. Figure 3d) is simply elucidated by plotting the permeances as a function
of πA/RT, calculated at the
upstream face of the membrane (see Figure 10c). The permeance of the tardier, more strongly
adsorbed n-C4H10 is practically
the same as the corresponding values for unary diffusion. The permeance
of the more mobile, poorly adsorbed CH4 is reduced significantly
below the unary values due to reduction in the M-S diffusivity of
CH4 with increased pore occupancy and the increasing influence
of correlations, as evidenced in the MD simulation data in Figure 5c.

The explanation
of the nC6/22DMB mixture permeation
data in Figure 4 requires
insights into entropy effects in mixture adsorption,33−38 gained from configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations25,36,37 for nC6/22DMB
mixture adsorption. The linear nC6 molecule can locate
along both the straight channels and zigzag channels, whereas the
more compact but bulkier dibranched isomer 22DMB can locate only at
the intersections (see computational snapshots in Figure 11a). Per unit cell of MFI,
there are only four intersection sites, and therefore, the saturation
capacity of 22DMB is restricted to four molecules per unit cell. On
the other hand, the saturation capacity for nC6 is
eight molecules per unit cell. CBMC simulations for nC6/22DMB mixture adsorption show that, for bulk phase partial pressure pi = 1 kPa, the 22DMB loading reaches a maximum
value at an adsorption potential πA/RT of 1.2 mol kg–1 (see Figure 11b). For pi > 1 kPa and πA/RT > 1.2 mol kg–1, the increase of bulk phase
partial
pressures results in the decrease in the 22DMB loading, engendered
by entropy effects that can be elucidated by invoking the entropy
maximization principle of Boltzmann S = kB ln(W).33,39 The experimental
permeance data for 50:50 nC6/22DMB mixtures were
obtained under conditions corresponding to πA/RT > 1.2 mol kg–1 (cf. Figure 11c), and the sharp
reduction in 22DMB permeance below the unary permeance values is entirely
ascribable to configurational entropy effects that cause 22DMB loading
at the upstream to decrease despite the increase in the bulk phase
partial pressures. Unusually, both adsorption and diffusion act in
synergy to suppress 22DMB permeation; this synergy is also observed
for transient uptake of hexane isomers in MFI zeolite.40

4 Conclusions
The following major conclusions
emerge from our investigations.(1) The adsorption potential, πA/RT, calculable from the IAST, is the
proper yardstick to compare permeances in mixtures with the corresponding
data for unary systems.

(2) The adsorption potential quantifies
the thermodynamic equilibrium between the fluid mixture in the upstream
compartment and the adsorbed phase in the upstream face of the membrane.
The IAST prescribes that the adsorption potential πA/RT, a practical proxy for the spreading pressure
π, be equal for each of the pure constituents and the mixture
(see eq 6).

(3) The same parameter πA/RT also dictates the variation of the
Maxwell–Stefan diffusivities, Đ1 and Đ2 and the degree of
correlations Đ1/Đ12 with pore occupancy (see Figure 5). The degree of correlations depends on
the guest/host combination.

(4) For cage-type zeolite structures such
as SAPO-34, DDR, and ZIF-8, the intercage hopping of guest molecules
is practically uncorrelated. Therefore, the component permeances in
such structures are uniquely dictated by the magnitude of πA/RT, irrespective of the partner species
in the mixture.

(5) In
topologies such as MFI, correlation
effects cause the permeance of the more mobile, less strongly adsorbed
component to be lowered due to correlations with the tardier, more
strongly adsorbed partners; the extent of lowering also correlates
with πA/RT.

(6) Also highlighted in this article is
the permeation of nC6/22DMB mixtures in the MFI membrane;
here, configurational entropy effects cause a significant lowering
in the permeance of the tardier dibranched isomer.
