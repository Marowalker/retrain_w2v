The
active site of the purple acid phosphatase enzyme has been
successfully modeled by a series of hetero-dinuclear M(II)–Fe(III)
[M = Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu] type complexes of an unsymmetrical [N6O] ligand that contained a bridging phenoxide moiety and one
imidazoyl and three pyridyl moieties as the terminal N-binding sites.
In particular, the hetero-dinuclear complexes, {L[MII(μ-OAc)2FeIII]}(ClO4)2 [M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)], were obtained directly from the phenoxy-bridged ligand
(HL), namely 2-{[bis(2-methylpyridyl)amino]methyl}-6-{[((1-methylimidazol-2-yl)methyl)(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}-4-t-butylphenol (2), upon sequential addition
of Fe(ClO4)3·XH2O and M(ClO4)2·6H2O (M = Zn
and Ni) or M(OAc)2·XH2O (M = Co and Cu), in a low-to-moderate (ca. 32–53%) yield.
The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated
weak antiferromagnetic coupling interactions occurring between the
two metal centers in their high-spin states. All of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes successfully carried out the hydrolysis of the bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl)phosphate
(2,4-BDNPP) substrate in a mixed CH3CN/H2O (v/v
1:1) medium in the pH range of 5.5–10.5 at room temperature,
thereby mimicking the functional activity of the native enzyme. The
spectrophotometric titration suggested a monoaquated and dihydroxo
species of the type {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+ to be the catalytically active species
for the phosphodiester hydrolysis reaction within the pH range of
ca. 5.80–7.15. Last, the kinetic studies on the hydrolysis
of the model substrate, 2,4-BDNPP, divulge a Michaelis–Menten-type
behavior for all complexes.

Introduction
Ubiquitous in the higher
and lower order of life forms,1−4 purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are nonspecific phosphomonoesterases
containing a hetero-dinuclear M(II)–Fe(III) [M(II) = Fe, Zn,
and Mn] type metal core in their active sites.5−10 The enzyme is distinguishable from other acid phosphatases by their
purple coloration that arises from a tyrosinate-to-Fe(III) charge
transfer transition observed at ca. 560 nm in their native forms.3,11 The hetero-dinuclear M(II)–Fe(III) [M(II) = Fe, Zn, and Mn]
core in the active site of the PAP enzyme is stabilized by seven amino
acid residues, of which a tyrosine, histidine, and monodentate aspartate
residue stabilizes the Fe(III) center, while two histidine residues
and an asparagine residue stabilize the M(II) center, and a seventh
amino acid residue, namely an aspartate moiety, bridges the two metal
centers.12

In its active state, the
hetero-bimetallic core of the enzyme contains
a M(II)-bound terminal aqua [M(II)–H2O] moiety and
a Fe(III)-bound terminal hydroxo [Fe(III)–OH] moiety and a
bridging hydroxo [M(II)–(μ-OH)–Fe(III)] moiety
between them.8,10 The enzymatic catalysis proceeds
by the activation of the phosphoester substrate by the binding of
its P-donor site to the divalent metal M(II) ion by replacing the
coordinated H2O molecule. Subsequent nucleophilic attack
by the terminal hydroxo [Fe(III)–OH] moiety onto the metal
bound P-atom of the phosphoester substrate leads to the hydrolysis
of the phosphoester bond.2,3 Another pathway involving
the nucleophilic attack by the bridging hydroxo [M(II)–(μ-OH)–Fe(III)]
moiety has also been proposed for some PAP enzyme activity.5,13,14

Extensive modeling studies
have been performed on PAP15−17 with several symmetrical18−21 and unsymmetrical ligand scaffolds.22−27 A primary challenge in designing such a ligand framework lies in
achieving the selectivity in binding the two metal ions at their respective
sites and also in preventing the disproportion of metal ions.19,28,29

In particular, the variation
of N/O donor functionalities yielded
several binucleating ligands containing {[N3O], [N3O]},25,30,31 {[N3O], [N2O2]},32−42 {[N3O], [NO3]},43,44 {[N3O], [N2O]},26 {[N2O2], [NO3]},24 and
{[N2O2], [N2O]}45−47 donor sites
that successfully stabilized a large number of hetero-dinuclear M(II)–M′(III)
[M(II) = Fe(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Co(II), and Ni(II) and M′(III)
= Fe(III) and Ga(III)] cores mimicking the PAP enzyme active site.
Of these, notable are the {[N3O], [N2O2]} ligand systems containing Zn(II)–Fe(III),18,35,39 Co(II)–Fe(III),32,34 Cu(II)–Fe(III),33,36 Mn(II)–Fe(III),38 and Ni(II)–Fe(III)37 cores and the {[N2O2], [N2O]} ligand systems containing Zn(II)–Fe(III), Co(II)–Fe(III),
Mn(II)–Fe(III), and Ni(II)–Fe(III)45−47 cores that
exhibited high PAP activities. In this regard, it is noteworthy that
although a great amount of studies has been performed with these PAP
model complexes using electronic spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR), and X-ray crystallography,2,3 providing
significant insights into the catalysis mechanism, mass spectrometric
detection of the catalysis intermediates has not been performed thus
far, and hence we decided to explore the same in our PAP modeling
study.

With one of our interest being in designing small-molecule
synthetic
analogues of a variety of metalloenzymes, namely catechol oxidase,48 catechol dioxygenase,49 and galactose oxidase,50 we became interested
in constructing model complexes of the more intriguing active site
of the PAP enzyme that contained a more challenging mixed valent hetero-bimetallic
M(II)–Fe(III) [M(II) = Fe, Zn, and Mn] core. For this purpose,
we intended to employ an unsymmetrical [N6O] ligand containing
a phenolate moiety capable of bridging the two metal centers, and
one imidazoyl, one pyridyl, and an N-amine for stabilizing the Fe(III)
center, and two pyridyl and an N-amine for stabilizing the M(II) center.

Here, in this manuscript, we report a series of mixed valence hetero-dinuclear
complexes of the type {L[MII(μ-OAc)2FeIII]}(ClO4)2 [M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)] supported over a new unsymmetrical [N6O] ligand framework
as small-molecule functional mimics of the PAP enzyme (Figure 1).

over unsymmetrical [N6O] ligand 2.

Results and Discussion
The ligand
framework, namely 2-{[bis(2-methylpyridyl)amino]methyl}-6-{[((1-methylimidazol-2-yl)methyl)(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}-4-t-butylphenol (HL) (2) was synthesized using
a modified procedure reported (Scheme 1).40 In particular, it was
constructed from two subunits, which were joined to obtain the desired
ligand (2). First, sidearm 1a was constructed
by the reaction of 2-(chloromethyl)-6-carbaldehyde-4-t-butylphenol and bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine in the presence of Et3N following a sequence of reactions, and the subsequent reduction
of 1a with NaBH4 yielded ligand fragment 1b. The reaction of 1b with (1-methylimidazol-2-ylmethyl)(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)-amine
in the presence of SOCl2 and NEt3 finally gave
ligand (2).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Unsymmetrical [N6O] Ligand 2
The dinuclear M(II)–Fe(III) type complexes of the
formulation
{L[MII(μ-OAc)2FeIII]}(ClO4)2 [M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)] were synthesized
from the Fe(ClO4)3·XH2O precursor, chosen for the Fe(III) site, and from the two
sources of metal salts, M(ClO4)2·6H2O (M = Zn and Ni) and M(OAc)2·XH2O (M = Co, X = 4 and M = Cu, X = 1), similarly chosen for the other M(II) site (Scheme 2). In particular,
the sequential reaction of ligand (2) with Fe(ClO4)3·XH2O and M(ClO4)2·6H2O (M = Zn and Ni) in the
presence of NaOAc gave dinuclear Zn(II)–Fe(III) complex (3a) and dinuclear Ni(II)–Fe(III) complex (3b). Similarly, the sequential reaction of ligand (2)
with Fe(ClO4)3·XH2O and M(OAc)2·XH2O (M = Co, X = 4 and M = Cu, X =
1) in the presence of NaOAc gave dinuclear Co(II)–Fe(III) complex
(4a) and dinuclear Cu(II)–Fe(III) complex (4b).

The electronic spectroscopy studies of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes
recorded in CH3CN showed two ligand-based transitions occurring
at ca. 208–215 and 250–254 nm and a ligand-to-metal
charge transfer (LMCT) transition appearing at ca. 518–559
nm (ε = 792–941 M–1 cm–1)40 (Table 1 and Supporting Information Figures S20, S24, S25, S86, S87, S147, S148, S209, and S210). The
LMCT transition at ca. 518–559 nm (ε = 792–941
M–1 cm–1) is consistent with the
tyrosine-to-Fe(III) charge transfer transition at ca. 546 nm (ε
= 2000 M–1 cm–1) in the PAP enzyme.1,51

All of the 3(a–b)
and 4(a–b) complexes were structurally
characterized
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies (Table 2 and Figures 2–5), which confirmed their heteronuclear bimetallic
nature, with two hexacoordinated metal centers being bridged by a
O-phenolate moiety and by the O-carboxylate groups of two acetate
ligands. Indeed, the infrared (IR) spectrum of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes
showed a symmetrical C–O stretching band at ca. 1606 cm–1 and an unsymmetrical C–O stretching band at
ca. 1412 cm–1 with a difference of ca. 187 cm–1 between the two stretching frequencies, in agreement
with those of the reported ionic carboxylate moieties bridging the
two metal centers.46 The overall coordination
environments in these two distorted octahedral sites are of the [N3O3] type, with the hard Fe(III) metal center attached
to a tertiary amine-N, a pyridyl-N, and a terminal imidazol-N atom
while the soft M(II) [M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)] center remains
coordinated to a tertiary amine-N and two pyridyl-N atoms of the bis-picolylamine
ligand fragment.

Further verification
of the hetero-dinuclear M(II)–Fe(III)
core came from the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICPAES) data of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes that gave Fe(III)/M(II)
[M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)] ratios of ca. 1:1, consistent with the
X-ray data (Table 3).

Of particular interest is the M···M
distance in
these binuclear 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes because the same in the
native enzyme contributes to the observed antiferromagnetic coupling
between the two metal centers.1 In this
regard, the M···M distance of 3.415(12) Å between
the Fe···Zn centers in 3a, 3.404(21) Å
between the Fe···Ni centers in 3b, 3.409(13)
Å between the Fe···Co centers in 4a, and 3.431(19) Å between the Fe···Cu centers
in 4b are slightly longer than the binuclear M···M
distance of 3.1 Å between the Fe···Zn centers
in the red kidney bean purple acid phosphatase10 and 3.31 Å between the Fe···Fe centers
in the mammalian purple acid phosphatase.7 The slightly longer M···M distances [3.404(21)–3.431(19)
Å] in the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes can be attributed to the presence
of two bridging acetate moieties present between the two metal centers
compared to one hydroxide moiety bridging the two metal centers in
the enzyme active site.7,10

To gain insight into the
nature of the interaction prevalent between
the two metal centers in these dinuclear PAP enzyme models, detailed
magnetic property studies were performed on the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes.
In particular, the magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried
out on the complexes at a magnetic field of 5000 Oe in the temperature
range of 4–300 K, and the data so obtained were fitted using
PHI software.52 It must be noted that weak
antiferromagnetic couplings were obtained in all of the complexes
except for 3a that contained only one magnetically active
metal ion (Tables 4 and 5 and Figure 6 and Supporting Information Figures S26–S28, S88–S90, S149–S151, and S211–S213).

fit curve).

Specifically, dinuclear Zn(II)–Fe(III)
complex 3a showed an effective magnetic moment (μeff) of 5.95μB consistent with only one magnetically
active center in the
form of high-spin Fe(III) (S = 5/2) having five unpaired
electrons (μs = 5.9μB).53 The variable temperature magnetic susceptibility
measurement gave a constant χMT value
of 4.39 cm3 mol–1 K as a function of
temperature with a gFe value of 1.96 as
obtained after fitting with PHI software (Figure 6).

The dinuclear Ni(II)–Fe(III)
core in 3b with
two unpaired electrons on the Ni(II) (S = 1) center
and five unpaired electrons on the high-spin Fe(III) (S = 5/2) center gave an effective magnetic moment (μeff) of 6.50μB at room temperature in agreement with
a weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the Ni(II) and Fe(III) centers.
Further substantiation came from the variable temperature χMT plot, which showed a decrease of the χMT value with decreasing temperature, arising
from the antiferromagnetic coupling between the Ni(II) and Fe(III)
centers (Figure 6).
The curve fitting analysis using the PHI software gave g values of gNi = 1.99 and gFe = 2.24 and an exchange coupling J =
−11.5 cm–1 comparable to the earlier observed
ranges of gNi (2.11–2.19) and gFe (1.96–2.0) and the exchange coupling
in the range of J [−(11.2–13.7) cm–1] for related dinuclear Ni(II)–Fe(III) complexes
known in the literature.46,54,55

which too contained a high-spin Co(II) (S = 3/2)
center and a high-spin Fe(III) (S = 5/2) center having
three and five unpaired electrons, respectively, exhibited an antiferromagnetic
coupling, as evident from the observed effective magnetic moment (μeff) of 6.49μB at room temperature. The variable
temperature μeff plot showed the familiar decrease
of μeff with the declining temperature up to 4.24μB at 4 K, in concurrence with the antiferromagnetic behavior
of the complex. The curve fitting of the variable temperature χMT plot gave g values of gCo = 1.98 and gFe = 2.01 and an exchange coupling of J = −3.82
cm–1 (Figure 6), which too are in good agreement with the earlier observed
ranges of gCo (1.92–2.10) and gFe (2.00–2.09)34,46 and the exchange coupling in the range of J [−(5.0–6.0)
cm–1] for related high-spin Co(II)–Fe(III)
complexes known in the literature.34,46,56

Last, complex 4b containing a
Cu(II)–Fe(III)
core showed even a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the Cu(II)
(S = 1/2) and high-spin Fe(III) (S = 5/2) centers containing one and five unpaired electrons, respectively,
and exhibited an effective magnetic moment (μeff)
of 6.12μB at room temperature. The variable temperature
χMT plot showed a decrease in the
χMT value with temperature, which
reaches a constant value in the region of ca. 35–4 K, with
an effective magnetic moment (μeff) of 4.50μB corresponding to the ground state of S =
2, consistent with the weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the
two metal centers (Figure 6). The curve fitting of the χMT plot resulted in g values of gCu = 2.00 and gFe = 1.98 and
an exchange coupling of J = −24.0 cm–1 and are comparable to the earlier observed values of gCu (1.85–2.21) and gFe (1.85–2.00)44,57 and the exchange coupling in
the range of J [−(20.0–58.1) cm–1] of the high-spin Cu(II)–Fe(III) complexes
reported.44,56,57 It is worth
mentioning that the phenoxide bridge moiety mediates the exchange
coupling in these dinuclear 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes, whereas
the bridging acetate plays a very small role in the magnetic property.34

To obtain an insight into the various
aquated species of the dinuclear
metal complexes, 3(a–b) and 4(a–b), present in equilibrium in solution,
the spectrophotometric titration experiment was undertaken under kinetic
conditions in a mixed medium of CH3CN/H2O (v/v
1:1) in the pH range of ca. 5.45–7.60 (Scheme 3 and Tables 6 and 7 and Supporting Information Tables S1–S3). It is noteworthy
that the λmax value of the characteristic LMCT band
of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes exhibited a hypsochromic shift from
ca. 518–559 nm in CH3CN to ca. 496–497 nm
in the mixed medium of CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1),
in concurrence with the replacement of bridging acetate moieties in
the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes by H2O molecules, thereby
suggesting the presence of different aquated species of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes in equilibrium.

Indeed, three isosbestic
points were observed in the pH range of
ca. 5.45–6.30, 5.85–7.15, and 6.70–7.60, consistent
with the conversion of the triaquated species, {L[(H2O)MII(μ-H2O)FeIII(H2O)]}4+, (3aA), (3bA), (4aA), and (4bA), to the diaquated and monohydroxo species,
{L[(H2O)MII(μ-H2O)FeIII(OH)]}3+, (3aB), (3bB), (4aB), and (4bB), to the monoaquated and dihydroxo
species, {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC), and finally to the trihydroxo
species, {L[(HO)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}+, (3aD), (3bD), (4aD), and (4bD), (Scheme 3), which correspond to the pKa values of 5.56–6.05 (pKa1), 6.37–6.79 (pKa2), and 6.98–7.48
(pKa3). Significantly enough, the monoaquated
and dihydroxo species of the intermediates, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC), and the
trihydroxo species of the intermediates, (3aD), (3bD), (4aD), and (4bD), have been
detected for the first time using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESIMS) studies (Supporting Information Figures S29, S30, S91, S92, S152, S153, S214, and S215). Of these
species, the monoaquated and dihydroxo species, {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC),
displaying pKa2 of 6.37–6.79 in
the pH range of ca. 5.85–7.15 are presumed to be the active
species of the phosphoester cleavage reaction.1,51

Indeed, all of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes performed the phosphodiester
cleavage of the bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl)phosphate (2,4-BDNPP) substrate
in CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1) medium in the pH range
of 5.5–10.5 at room temperature, in concurrence with the PAP
enzyme-like activity (Chart 1 and Scheme 4). The hydrolysis reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at
400 nm [ε = 12 100 M–1 cm–1 of the 2,4-dinitrophenolate (2,4-DNP–) anion]
at 25 °C.39

Scheme 4 Proposed Mechanism
for the Hydrolysis of 2,4-BDNPP as Catalyzed by
Dinuclear {L[MII(μ-OAc)2FeIII]}(ClO4)2 [M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)] Type
Complexes Supported over Unsymmetrical [N6O] Ligand 2
Bell-shaped profiles
spanning the pH range of 5.5–9.5 having
maxima at pH 6.5 for 3a and 4a and at pH
7.0 for 4b were observed analogous to that of the other
related hetero-dinuclear complexes34,36,39 and also to that of the PAP enzyme (Figure 7 and Supporting Information Figures S64, S187, and S249).58 Sigmoidal fit to the decline part of the pH profile graph
of the complexes gave pKa values of 7.52
(3a), 7.24 (4a), and 8.03 (4b) (Supporting Information Figures S65,
S188 and S250), which are in good agreement with the pKa3 values of 7.13 (3a), 7.14 (4a), and 7.48 (4b) as obtained by spectrophotometric titration
studies. The 3b complex (Supporting Information Figure S126), however, showed a different profile,
for which the rate at pH 7.0 was taken for the saturation kinetics
studies on the basis of the fact that PAPs do not show enzymatic activity
in an alkaline medium.51

Figure 7 pH profile overlay of
the initial rates for the hydrolysis of 2,4-BDNPP
as catalyzed by {L[MII(μ-OAc)2FeIII]}(ClO4)2 [M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)] type
complexes in CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1).

As the initial rates (V0) are proportional
to the concentration of the active species, the maximum value of the
initial rate (V0) at a particular pH signifies
the highest concentration of the active species at that pH. For the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes, the maximum initial rates were observed at the pH ranges
that fall between pKa1 and pKa2, thereby indicating the monoaquated and dihydroxo species
of the type {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC), to be the active species analogous
to that of the mammalian58,59 and plant purple acid
phosphatases60 and to a small-molecule
enzyme model consisting of a dinuclear Zn(II)–Fe(III) complex.35,61

It is interesting to note that the monoaquated and dihydroxo
species
of the type {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC), contains a labile M(II)–(H2O) moiety, which can be easily replaced by the 2,4-BDNPP substrate,
after which, the other metal center consisting of a Fe(III)–(OH)
moiety can partake a nucleophilic attack on the P atom of the adjacent
metal-bound 2,4-BDNPP moiety. Under limiting conditions, that is,
at pH lower than pKa1, the Fe(III)–(OH)
moiety in {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC) gets protonated, resulting in
a decrease in the reaction rates, whereas at pH higher than pKa3, the M(II)–(H2O) moiety
gets deprotonated, resulting in a loss of lability of the −OH
moiety from the M(II) center, thereby inhibiting the 2,4-BDNPP coordination
to the metal center.

Thus, the kinetics data with respect to
the substrate concentration
under saturation kinetics conditions were obtained at pH 6.5 for complexes 3a and 4a and at pH 7.0 for complexes 3b and 4b and fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation.
The linearization of the curves was achieved using the Lineweaver–Burk
method providing the Km, Vmax, and kcat parameters (Table 8 and Figure 8 and Supporting Information Figures S81, S142, S204, and S266).

(3a/3b/4a/4b),
0.5–4.0 mM 2,4-BDNPP, and 0.05 M buffer (pH = 6.5 for 3a and 4a and pH = 7.0 for 3b and 4b) with ionic strength of 0.1 M NaClO4 in 2.5
mL of CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1) at 25 °C. kuncat = 3.2 × 10–8 s–1.62

Quite interestingly, the high Kass values
of ca. (0.37–1.06) mM–1 obtained from Km (Kass ≅
1/Km) for the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes indicate
a stronger affinity of the 3(a–b)
and 4(a–b) complexes toward the 2,4-BDNPP
substrate. Furthermore, the comparable Km values for the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes suggest an analogous
mode of interaction of these complexes with the 2,4-BDNPP substrate.

For the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes, the kcat values appear in the range of ca. 1.4 × 10–6–1.9 × 10–4 s–1 and
are smaller than the reported ones.34,36,37,39,46 Under similar reaction conditions, the rate of hydrolysis of the
2,4-BDNPP substrate as catalyzed by the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes are ca. 40–5900
times faster than the uncatalyzed reaction,62 with the 3b complex being the most active.

On
the basis of the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
experiments and saturated kinetics studies, a mechanism for the hydrolysis
of the 2,4-BDNPP substrate by the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes has been
proposed in Scheme 4.

Under the experimental conditions at a pH range
of ca. 5.80–7.15,
the monoaquated and dihydroxo-type active species, {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+,
(3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC), so formed, would react with the 2,4-BDNPP substrate
with the loss of a H2O molecule from the metal-bound H2O site, [M(II)–(H2O)], yielding a metal-bound
2,4-BDNPP species of type {L[(R2PO4)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}+, (3aE), (3bE), (4aE), and (4bE).
Significantly enough, the monoaquated and dihydroxo-type active species,
{L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+, has been detected using mass spectrometry for representative
intermediates, namely (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC).

Subsequent intramolecular
attack of the Fe(III)–(OH) moiety
onto the P atom of the metal-bound 2,4-BDNPP species results in {L[MII(μ-OH)(μ-RPO4)FeIII]}+ type intermediates, (3aF), (3bF), (4aF), and (4bF), all of which have
been detected for the first time using mass spectrometry (Supporting Information S82, S143, S205, and S267).
Last, the {L[MII(μ-OH)(μ-RPO4)FeIII]}+ type intermediates, (3aF), (3bF), (4aF), and (4bF), would react
with H2O yielding the phosphodiester cleavage product,
2,4-DNP along with the regeneration of the {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+ type active
species, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC).

Conclusions
In summary, a series
of mixed valence hetero-dinuclear M(II)–Fe(III)
complexes of the type {L[MII(μ-OAc)2FeIII]}(ClO4)2 [M = Zn (3a), Ni (3b), Co (4a), and Cu (4b)] supported over an unsymmetrical [N6O] ligand has been
synthesized and structurally characterized. The temperature-dependent
magnetic susceptibility measurements on these complexes showed an
exchange coupling in the range of J [−(3.82–24.0)
cm–1], indicating the presence of a weak antiferromagnetic
coupling between the two metal centers. All of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes
successfully catalyzed the hydrolysis of the 2,4-BDNPP substrate in
CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1) medium in line with that
of the native enzyme. Furthermore, the spectrophotometric and kinetic
data suggested a monoaquated and dihydroxo species, {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+,
(3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC) to be the catalytically active species for the hydrolysis
reaction. On the basis of the mass spectrophotometric evidences, a
catalytic pathway has been proposed that involves the intramolecular
nucleophilic attack of an Fe(III)-bound terminally hydroxo [Fe(III)–OH]
moiety on the P atom of the M(II)-bound substrate 2,4-BDNPP, yielding
the hydrolyzed 2,4-dinitrophenol product. Finally, it can thus be
concluded that the hetero-dinuclear mixed valence 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes
successfully mimic the functional aspects of the PAP enzyme.

General Procedures
All manipulations were carried out
using the combination of a glovebox and standard Schlenk techniques.
2-Aminomethylpyridine, Fe(ClO4)3·XH2O, Zn(ClO4)3·6H2O, Ni(ClO4)3·6H2O, and nBuLi were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co., whereas
all other chemicals used were purchased from S D Fine-Chem (India)
and Spectrochem (India) and were used without any further purification.
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide (DMF) were dried over
a Na wire and calcium hydride, respectively.63 2,6-Bis(hydroxymethyl)-4-t-butylphenol,64 2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-carbaldehyde-4-t-butylphenol,40 2-(chloromethyl)-6-carbaldehyde-4-t-butylphenol,40 bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine,41 1-methylimidazole-2-carbaldehyde,65 (1-methylimidazol-2-ylmethyl)(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)-amine,66 and 2,4-BDNPP62 were
synthesized according to modified literature procedures. 1H and 13C{1H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectra were recorded on Bruker 400 MHz and Bruker 500 MHz NMR spectrometers,
respectively. 1H NMR peaks are labeled as singlet (s),
doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), quartet-of-doublets (qd), doublet-of-doublets
(dd), septet (sept), and broad (br). The electronic spectra of 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes were recorded in CH3CN using a UV 3600 Shimadzu
spectrophotometer. Mass spectrometry measurements were done on a Micromass
Q-Tof spectrometer and a Bruker maxis impact spectrometer. Elemental
analysis was carried out on a Thermo Finnigan FLASH EA 1112 SERIES
(CHNS) elemental analyzer. The variable temperature magnetic experiments
were executed in a SQUID-VSM magnetometer (Quantum Design, USA), and
the data were fitted using PHI software.52

X-ray Crystallography
X-ray diffraction data for compounds 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) were collected on a Rigaku Hg 724+ diffractometer for unit cell
determination and intensity data collection. The crystals diffracted
weakly. Data integration and indexing were carried out using the Rigaku
suite of programs, CrystalClear and CrystalStructure. Structure refinement
and geometrical calculations were carried out using programs in the
WinGX module.67 The final structure refinement
was carried out using the full least-squares method on F2 using SHELXL-2014
software.68 The diffuse electron density
in solvent-accessible regions that could not be modeled was handled
with a routine SQUEEZE procedure of the PLATON program.69 The squeezed electron density of 21.1 electrons
in the solvent accessible voids per unit cell occupying a volume of
202.9 Å3 approximately corresponds to one water solvate
per two molecules in the unit cell. The residual high-density electron
density peaks near the imidazole ring could not be modeled and have
been left untreated. The disordered perchlorate anions in the lattice
have been modeled with PART instruction. The final refinement converged
at R[I > 2σ(I)] values of 0.0769 (3a), 0.1198 (3b),
0.0870 (4a), and 0.0905 (4b), the higher
values being a result of weak diffraction data. Crystal data collection
and refinement parameters are summarized in Table 2. CCDC-990172 (for 3a), CCDC-1420070
(for 3b), CCDC-1403981 (for 4a), and CCDC-1412192

added, resulting in a white precipitate. The reaction mixture was
then stirred overnight at room temperature, after which it was filtered,
and the volatiles were removed under vacuum. The residue was further
purified by column chromatography over silica gel as a stationary

To a solution of
2-{[bis(2-methylpyridyl)amino]methyl}-6-carbaldehyde-4-t-butylphenol (1a) (4.31 g, 11.1 mmol) in MeOH (ca. 50
mL), NaBH4 (1.27 g, 33.6 mmol) was added portion wise.
The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min at room temperature and
then refluxed for another 30 min. The solution was acidified to pH
2 using concentrated HCl solution and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated
under reduced pressure to obtain a residue, which was redissolved
in saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (ca. 50 mL). The aqueous
medium was extracted with CH2Cl2 (ca. 3 ×
30 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and filtered,
and the volatiles were removed under vacuum to give a crude product.
The crude product was further purified by washing with hot petroleum
ether to yield product 1b as a yellow viscous liquid

Synthesis
of 2-{[Bis(2-methylpyridyl)amino]methyl}-6-{[((1-methylimidazol-2-yl)methyl)(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}-4-t-butylphenol (2)
To a solution of
2-{[bis(2-methylpyridyl)amino]methyl}-6-(hydroxymethyl)-4-t-butylphenol (1b) (2.83 g, 7.23 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (ca. 30 mL), a solution of SOCl2 (1.72 g, 14.4 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (ca. 10 mL)
was added dropwise, resulting in a bright yellow solution that was
stirred for 6 h at room temperature. The volatiles were then removed
under vacuum to give a residue, which was further washed with hexane
(ca. 3 × 20 mL) and CH2Cl2 (ca. 3 ×
20 mL) and dried under a reduced pressure to get a white solid. The
resultant solid was dissolved in MeOH (ca. 20 mL) and added dropwise
to a solution of (1-methylimidazol-2-ylmethyl)(pyrid-2-ylmethyl)-amine
(1.46 g, 7.22 mmol) and NEt3 (1.10 g, 10.8 mmol) in MeOH
(ca. 20 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for another 24 h at
room temperature. The volatiles were evaporated, and the residue was
redissolved in KH2PO4 buffer (ca. 50 mL, pH
7, 0.1 M). The aqueous medium was extracted with CH2Cl2 (ca. 3 × 30 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and filtered, and the volatiles were removed under
vacuum to give the crude product. The crude product was further purified
by column chromatography over silica gel as a stationary phase by
elution with the CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1 v/v) mixed
medium to yield product 2 as a yellow solid (1.04 g,
25%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz, 25 °C): δ

General Procedure for ICPAES
For inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES), 2.5 mg of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes were dissolved in ca. 5 mL of aqua regia and diluted
to ca. 25 mL using distilled water, and the data were collected using
ICPAES.

General Procedure for Spectrophotometric Titration
A 6.0 × 10–4 M solution of the 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes in CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1) having the
ionic strength of 0.1 M KCl was titrated with 0.1 M NaOH solution,
and a change in the position of λmax was observed
at the pH range of ca. 5.50–7.60.

General Procedure for Phosphoester
Hydrolysis
By using
a UV 3600 Shimadzu spectrophotometer, the increase in the concentration
of the product 2,4-DNP was monitored at 25 °C by UV–vis
spectroscopy at 400 nm in quartz cuvettes. The kinetics measurements
were done in CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1). For the study
of pH dependence, the substrate and complex concentrations were 0.002
and 3.75 × 10–4 M, respectively, and the ionic
strength and pH were kept constant by using total concentrations of
0.1 M NaClO4 and 0.05 M buffer 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES, pH 5.5–6.5), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES, pH 7.0–8.0), N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid (CHES, pH 8.5–9.0), and N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic
acid (CAPS, pH 9.5–10.5). The pH value of the buffer was adjusted
in standard solutions using a calibrated pH meter. Each cuvette was
prepared by the successive addition of 1062.5 μL of CH3CN, 62.5 μL of 0.080 M standard solution of 2,4-BDNPP in CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1), and 1250 μL of 0.1 M buffer
solution containing 0.2 M NaClO4. After mixing, the background
absorption was measured. Then, 125 μL of 0.0075 M standard solution
of complex (3a/3b/4a/4b) in CH3CN was added, and the increase in absorption
over time was measured at 400 nm. The initial rates were calculated
by fitting a linear line to the curve corresponding to absorbance
<5%. The total concentration of 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) from
the absorption of the 2,4-dinitrophenolate (2,4-DNP−) anion at 400 nm was calculated from the molar extinction coefficient
(ε) of 2,4-DNP anion (12 100 M–1 cm–1).

For the study of dependence of the substrate
concentration on the initial rate, varying volumes of a stock solution
of 2,4-BDNPP (0.080 M) were added to the cuvette to give a total concentration
of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mM while the complex concentration
was kept constant at 0.05 mM. Kinetic measurements were done using
the Michaelis–Menten equation, and the results were evaluated
from the Lineweaver–Burk plots.

Mass Spectrometry
General
Procedure
The molecular weight of the monoaquated
and dihydroxo species, {L[(H2O)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}2+, (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), and (4bC), the trihydroxo species,
{L[(HO)MII(μ-OH)FeIII(OH)]}+, (3aD), (3bD), (4aD), and
(4bD), and the metal-bound 2,4-BDNPP species {L[MII(μ-OH)(μ-RPO4)FeIII]}+, (3aF), (3bF), (4aF), and (4bF) of the proposed mechanistic cycle were
characterized by direct-injection ESIMS (DIESIMS) studies performed
on a Bruker maxis impact mass spectrometer. The measurements were
obtained in positive-ion detection modes on an ion trap mass spectrometer
with an ESI source.

General Procedure for the Direct Ionization
ESIMS Detection
of (3aC), (3bC), (4aC), (4bC), (3aD), (3bD), (4aD), and (4bD)
The 3(a–b) and 4(a–b) complexes were dissolved
in the CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1) mixed medium (ca.
1 mL) at room temperature and was further diluted with CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1) (ca. 5 mL). An aliquot of the sample
solution was directly injected into an ESI mass spectrometer to obtain
the mass spectrometric data.

General Procedure for the
Direct Ionization ESIMS Detection
of (3aF), (3bF), (4aF), and
(4bF)
The data were collected under kinetic
conditions. Each vial was prepared by the successive addition of 1062.5
μL of CH3CN, 62.5 μL of 0.080 M standard solution
of 2,4-BDNPP in CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1), 1250 μL
of 0.1 M buffer solution containing 0.2 M NaClO4 (pH =
6.5), and 125 μL of 0.0075 M standard solution of complex (3a/3b/4a/4b) in CH3CN. The reaction mixture was then diluted with CH3CN/H2O (v/v 1:1) (ca. 5 mL), and an aliquot of the sample
solution was directly injected into an ESI mass spectrometer to obtain
the mass spectrometric data.
