We have studied degradation of photocatalytic activity
of TiOxNy for
water
splitting under visible light irradiation with heat treatment in O2/N2 mixed gas. The reduction of the N content by
oxidation through the formation of O–N–O species (NOx) was confirmed as the result of the reduction
of the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity is not simply related
to the amount of N remained but that of N taking the chemical state
of O–Ti–N in TiOxNy, which is the active species for visible light responsiveness
on hydrogen evolution. N in TiOxNy is first oxidized to NO2 species
during the oxidation, which reduces the activity. Then, O–N–O
species (NOx) is removed as NOx gas from the surface. Because the formation of O–N–O
in TiOxNy could
induce an impurity energy level to enhance charge recombination, the
loss of catalytic activity might be influenced by the formation of
O–N–O species (NOx) rather
than the loss of the N content from TiOxNy.

Introduction
In recent days, the oxynitride of Ti (TiO1–xNy)
has been extensively
studied as photocatalysts for the water splitting and decomposition
of organic pollutants.1,2 However, the role and/or chemical
state of N doped in TiOxNy on photocatalytic activity has not been examined
in detail. In addition, there are concerns on the stability of N in
TiOxNy under
photocatalytic water splitting or other reductive reactions3−5 and also stability of N in TiOxNy under some heat treatments required for
its industrial use such as calcination or heat treatment in air.6 This research situation motivates us to investigate
the chemical state of N in TiOxNy and its role for photocatalytic water splitting
and to examine the stability of N in TiOxNy or TiOxNy itself under mild oxidation conditions.

The results are reported in two series of papers. In paper I, entitled
as “Characterization of N in TiOxNy/TiO2 photocatalyst”,
we have given results that TiOxNy consisting of the fcc phase on the TiO2 core (TiOxNy/TiO2) shows photocatalytic activity to generate hydrogen
from methanol aqueous solution under visible light irradiation, in
particular, formation of N–Ti–O species is critical
to have the catalytic activity. In the present paper, referred as
paper II, entitled as “Degradation of photocatalytic activity
of TiOxNy with
mild oxidation”, stability of N in TiOxNy/TiO2 or TiOxNy/TiO2 itself
under mild oxidation condition was examined. The results of papers
I and II were used comprehensively in the Discussion section.

For industrial use of photocatalysts, some engineering
processes
are required to make the configuration or shape of the catalysts to
attain efficient use of photon. For evaluation of photocatalytic activity,
micrometer- to nanometer-sized catalysts are often used as dispersion
or suspension of them in water including reactants.6 However, the photocatalysts used in industries are generally
fixed on a substrate shaped as a board, panel, and so forth for the
following two reasons; (1) in case of surface contamination of the
photocatalysts, periodic cleaning is required. The cleaning of fixed
photocatalysts on a substrate is easier than that of dispersion or
suspension and (2) a fixed panel array has an advantage in cost compared
to a particle suspension system on water splitting.7−9 The fixation
of the photocatalysts to the substrate is usually performed by calcination
or heat treatment in air.10 Considering
a report by Tajima et al.,11 in which annealing
of N-doped TiO2 in the presence of oxygen gas decreased
its N content and photocatalytic activity, TiOxNy/TiO2 would be unstable
at high temperature in the presence of oxygen. However, details of
chemical state changes in TiOxNy under mild oxidation and relationship between the
chemical state change and photocatalytic activity have not been examined
yet. Hence, in this paper, we have investigated the effect of the
mild oxidation of TiOxNy/TiO2 on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in methanol
aqueous solution under visible light irradiation with detailed analysis
of the oxidation of TiOxNy/TiO2 and characterization of N in it.

Results
Figure 1 shows the
integrated amount of hydrogen evolution as the function of reaction
time for three samples [(a) TON, (b) OXTON-573 K (2%),
and (c) OXTON-673 K (2%)]. No hydrogen evolution was observed
in the sample without nitriding (JRC-TIO-7), as described in paper
I. As seen in Figure 1, TON showed photocatalytic activity and continued its activities
for 5 h showing nearly a constant hydrogen production rate. This is
consistent with the results of the paper I. Among the oxidized samples,
only OXTON-573 K (2%) remained the activity of nearly half
of TON, and the others showed no photocatalytic activity.

Figure 1 Hydrogen production

under visible light irradiation over (a) TON, (b) OXTON-573
K (2%), and (c) OXTON-673 K (2%). All samples were deposited
with 1 wt % Pt as the cocatalyst.

X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples are compared
in Figure 2. As noted
in the
paper I, TON was consisted of the fcc phase of TiOxNy covering TiO2 showing
anatase. Although some N could be doped in the anatase phase, the
diffraction patterns of the anatase phase in Figure 2 are quite similar to anatase crystalline.
The oxidation reduced the peaks of the TiOxNy phase, and the heavier oxidation made
most of the sample to be of fully the anatase phase. The oxidation
resulted in appreciable changes in the diffraction patterns, that
is, a peak appeared at around 43° because (200) diffraction of
TiOxNy decreased
its intensity and shifted to a higher angle with heating at higher
temperature and higher oxygen concentration. This indicates that N
was removed by the oxidation, and the average distances of Ti–N
and Ti–O in TiOxNy phase decreased because the lattice spacing of (200) in TiOxNy corresponds
to the average distance of a mixture of Ti–O and Ti–N.
On the other hand, peaks at 25 and 48° corresponding to (101)
and (200) diffractions of the anatase hardly changed. This suggests
that even if some N were doped in the anatase phase, its influence
on the hydrogen evolution should be quite small.

side figures are enlarged views at
around 43° and 48°.

UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the
samples are shown
in Figure 3. The original
TiO2 (JRC-TIO-7) showed a clear cut-off at around 380 nm,
corresponding to its band gap, while TON showed large and broad absorption
in the wavelength region from 500 to 800 nm, which has been attributed
to the existence of Ti3+ corresponding to the formation
of the TiOxNy phase.12,13 Oxidation at 673 K reduced the broad absorption
because of the oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+. As
given in Table 1, little
change was observed in specific surface area with the oxidation, maintaining
at around 30 m2/g. N K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge
spectroscopy (XANES) spectra also showed significant changes with
the oxidation, as given in Figure 4. The characteristic double-peaked structure appeared
at around 396–402 eV in TON is a typical indication of the
existence of the TiOxNy phase. The oxidation clearly reduced the double peaks and
gave a new single peak at around 400 eV. However, the 400 eV peak
mostly disappeared with the heavier oxidation condition. N 1s and
O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the samples
are shown in Figure 5. In the N 1s spectra, TON had a single peak at 396 eV, while OXTON-673 K (2%) had double peaks at 396 and 402 eV. The double
peaks are assigned to N bonded to Ti (NTi) and O–N–O
(NOx) species (NNO).14,15 The intensity of NTi significantly decreased after the
oxidation, showing a decrease in the N content. The O 1s XPS spectrum
in TON is divided into three species, Ti–O–Ti bonding
of lattice oxygen (OL) at 530.1 eV, OH groups on the surface
(OOH) at 532.3 eV, and C–O bonding (OC) at 534 eV caused by surface contaminants in air, respectively.16 On the other hand, the spectrum in OXTON-673 K (2%) shows four kinds of oxygen species, (OL, OOH, and OC) and O–N–O species
at 533.6 eV (ONO).17 In addition,
OL in OXTON-673 K (2%) shifted lower binding
energy rather than that in TON, indicating a decrease in the N content.
Both N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra showed the formation of O–N–O
species and decrease in the N content by the oxidation of TON.

Discussion
The present results clearly show that TiOxNy/TiO2 giving high
photocatalytic activity on the hydrogen evolution was oxidized under
rather mild oxidation conditions and lost its catalytic activity.
Oxidation must result in the removal of N in TiOxNy and even doped N in TiO2. In the following, details of N removal process in the oxidation
are discussed. As concluded in paper I, active species for visible
light responsiveness is most likely O–Ti–N species in
the TiOxNy phase. Therefore, either or both the removal of N from TiOxNy/TiO2 or
changes of the chemical state of N in TiOxNy/TiO2 could be the cause
for the loss of the activity.

Considering a higher angle shift
of the 43° peak corresponding
to lattice spacing of (200) in TiOxNy, the oxidation induced the replacement of
the N atom with an O atom to make the average distance of Ti–O
and Ti–N shorter because the ionic radius of O2– is smaller than that of N3– (see Table 1).18 On the other hand, in (200) in anatase TiO2, no peak
shift was observed. If N atoms were doped in TiO2 by nitriding,
the oxidation should change the (200) peak in TiO2 to higher
angle corresponding to the decrease in photocatalytic activity. However,
no such change was observed. Thus, we concluded that the anatase phase,
even if they contained some N, was hardly contributing to the hydrogen
evolution. This indicates that the removal of N from TiOxNy by heavy oxidation
actually caused the loss of the photocatalytic activity.

In
milder oxidation, it is found that changes of the chemical state
of N in TiOxNy also reduced the photocatalytic activity, as discussed in the following.
As shown in Figure 3, the oxidation reduced the absorption in the visible region drastically.
However, referring the absorption spectra of the samples reported
in paper I, the loss of photocatalytic activity caused by the oxidation
was more appreciable than that expected from the reduction in optical
absorption. This suggests some changes in the chemical state of N
in TiOxNy before
its removal.

The oxidation gave significant changes in the UV-vis
diffuse reflectance,
as seen in Figure 3 and N K-edge XANES, as seen in Figure 4b–d. The characteristic double-peaked
structure appeared at around 396–402 eV in TiOxNy decreased with the
oxidation temperature. Instead, a sharp single peak at 400 eV appeared
which was attributed to the formation of O–N–O in TiOxNy.19 With higher temperature oxidation (see OXTON-673 K (2%) in Figure 4), the double-peaked structure changed to the single
peak. As N K-edge XANES in the total electron yield mode gives information
on depth within 10 nm from the surface, the oxidation changed the
boding of O–Ti–N near the surface of TiOxNy to O–N–O.
If many O–N–O were formed in the bulk of TiOxNy, the lower angle shift
of (200) diffraction of TiOxNy should be observed because O–N–O is
larger than the N atom. Nevertheless, the higher angle shift was observed
(see Figure 2). Hence,
under milder oxidation condition, before the removal of N, O–N–O
species (or bonding) appeared near the surface region of TiOxNy.

The
formation of O–N–O (NOx)
species was also confirmed in N 1s and O 1s XPS spectra of
the oxidized samples (Figure 5). Because of limited analyzing depth of XPS, the formation
of these species in the deeper region over 10 nm from the surface
was not clear.

Thus, in milder oxidation, the formation of O–N–O
near the surface region of TiOxNy is likely the main cause for the reduction of the
photocatalytic activity on the hydrogen evolution. Also, the oxidation
process seems to proceed as following; first, O attacks N in O–Ti–N–Ti
to break Ti–N bonding to make O–N–O in surface
layers, and further oxidation makes N a fully oxidized state to be
released. Asahi and Morikawa20 calculated
density of states of TiO2 with various nitrogen complex
species including substitutional NO2-doping. Their calculation
showed that substitutional NO2-doping species created an
impurity energy state between the conduction band and the valence
band. An impurity energy state has been known to trap the photogenerated
carriers and to inhibit moving to the surface of the carrier.11 This calculation well corresponds to the present
results. Similar to NO2-doped TiO2, the formation
of O–N–O in TiOxNy could induce an impurity level to enhance charge
recombination resulting some inhibition of the photocatalytic activity
of TiOxNy.
Actually, the photocatalytic activity of OXTON-673 (2%)
disappeared, though O–Ti–N species still remained (see
lines (c) in Figures 1, 4 and line (b) of O 1s in Figure 5).

Thus, even when N
remained in TiOxNy, the photocatalytic activity could be significantly
reduced owing to the formation of O–N–O species, and
the loss of photocatalytic activity by the oxidation is totally different
from the loss of activity during the photocatalytic reaction, as indicated
in paper I, because of different N loss mechanisms.

For industrial
use of TiOxNy as a photocatalyst for water splitting, development
of methods for fixing TiOxNy photocatalyst powder on a substrate plate under
soft oxidation condition is necessary, for example, calcination in
air must be done far below 573 K.

Conclusions
We have investigated degradation of photocatalytic
activity of
TiOxNy/TiO2 with heat treatment in the presence of O2 gas
considering its industrial use making panel array configuration with
deposition and/or calcination of TiOxNy on a substrate panel. At first, TiOxNy/TiO2 with a structure of the TiO2 core covered by TiOxNy layers was
synthesized, and its photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution
under visible light irradiation was confirmed. In paper I, O–Ti–N
species in TiOxNy is found to be the cause of the photocatalytic activity on
water splitting. Oxidation of TiOxNy/TiO2 even under rather mild oxidation
condition, that is, at 573 K in N2 with 2% O2, significantly reduced the photocatalytic activity. Although the
N content was reduced by the oxidation, the N removal or the N content
remained did not simply correspond to the reduction of the activity.
It is very likely that N in O–Ti–N species in TiOxNy is first changed
to O–N–O (NOx) species by
the oxidation, and further oxidation caused phase change from TiOxNy to anatase
(TiO2) by removing N as NOx from the surface. Because the formation of O–N–O in
TiOxNy could
induce an impurity level to enhance charge recombination, the loss
of photocatalytic activity is likely caused by the formation of O–N–O
(NOx) rather than the removal of N or
reduction of the N content in TiOxNy. Because N solubility or the amount N possibly
doped in TiO2 is quite small, the TiO2 phase
would not have photocatalytic activity on water splitting.

In
conclusion, the photocatalytic activity of TiOxNy on water splitting should be
easily lost by calcination of TiOxNy, for its deposition on a panel or a plate
under mild oxidation condition is observed (heating above 573 K).
To retain the photocatalytic activity, maintaining the chemical state
of N as the O–Ti–N species is more important than maintaining
the N content. Considering these points, it is desirable to develop
methods for fixing TiOxNy photocatalyst powder on a substrate plate under soft oxidation
conditions. For example, calcination must be done at far below 573
K; otherwise, we have to develop a new method to synthesize TiOxNy resistant
to oxidation.

Experiments
Synthesis of TiOxNy/TiO2 Photocatalyst Samples
TiOxNy/TiO2 photocatalyst
samples were prepared in the same way as reported in the paper I;
In brief, anatase type TiO2 (JRC-TIO-7, Japan Reference
Catalyst) was nitrided under NH3 gas flow at 1050 K. The
sample used here consisted of the TiOxNy phase covering the TiO2 core (referred as TON hereafter) and showed the highest photocatalytic
activity for hydrogen evolution from methanol aqueous solution as
half reaction of water splitting under visible light irradiation in
the synthesized sample.

To investigate the degradation of photocatalytic
activity of TON for the hydrogen evolution by heat treatment in the
presence of O2 gas, TON was heat treated at 573 K or 673
K for 2 h in the mixed gases of N2 and O2 with
two different oxygen contents, that is, 2% for milder oxidation and
21% for air except minor elements. Thus, oxidized samples are referred
as OXTON-573 K (2%), and OXTON-673 K (2%) or
OXTON-673 K (21%).

Characterization of the Samples
Diffuse reflectance
spectra of the TON sample and the oxidized ones were obtained by using
a UV–vis–NIR spectrometer (JASCO, V-670) in the wavelength
range of 200–850 nm. The reflectance was converted to the absorbance
by the Kubelka–Munk function referring that of BaSO4 as a standard. The crystal structure of the samples was identified
by X-ray diffraction analysis (Rigaku, RINT-TTRIII). Concentration
and the chemical state of nitrogen or oxygen in the samples were investigated
by XPS (Shimadzu, ESCA-3400HSE). N K edge XANES spectra of the samples
were measured with the BL7U at the Aichi Synchrotron Radiation Center
at room temperature in the total electron yield mode. The specific
surface area of the samples was determined by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) method (Mountech, Macsorb HM-1220).

Photocatalytic Activity
Photocatalytic activities of
TON and the oxidized samples were examined by the same way as in the
paper I for the half reaction of water splitting under visible light
irradiation in methanol aqueous solution. The reaction is referred
simply as hydrogen evolution hereafter. Pt nanoparticles (1 wt %)
as the cocatalyst was deposited on the samples by a photodeposition
method.21 The sample (0.1 g) was put into
10 mL of 20 vol % methanol aqueous solution in a quartz cell under
He gas flow at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The cell was irradiated with
visible light (λ > 440) given by a 300 W xenon lamp with
cutting
UV light by a cut-off filter, L-44 (OptoSigma, SCF-50S-44Y). The production
of hydrogen was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, TCD-GC,
GC-8A).
