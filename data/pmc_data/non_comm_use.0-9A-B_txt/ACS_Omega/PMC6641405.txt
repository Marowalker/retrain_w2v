One-dimensional photonic crystals
or multilayer films produce colors
that change depending on viewing and light illumination angles because
of the periodic refractive index variation in alternating layers that
satisfy Bragg’s law. Recently, we have developed multilayered
photonic hydrogels of two distinct bulk geometries that possess an
alternating structure of a rigid polymeric lamellar bilayer and a
ductile polyacrylamide (PAAm) matrix. In this paper, we focus on fabrication
of composite gels with variable photonic band gaps by controlling
the PAAm layer thickness. We report programmable angle-dependent and
angle-independent structural colors produced by composite hydrogels,
which is achieved by varying bulk and internal geometries. In the
sheet geometry, where the lamellae are aligned parallel to the sheet
surface, the photonic gel sheet exhibits strong angle-dependent colors.
On the other hand, when lamellae are coaxially aligned in a cylindrical
geometry, the gel rod exhibits an angle-independent color, in sharp
contrast with the gel sheet. Rocking curves have been constructed
to justify the diverse angle-dependent behavior of various geometries.
Despite varying the bulk geometry, the tunable photonic gels exhibit
strong mechanical performances and toughness. The distinct angle dependence
of these tough photonic materials with variable band gaps could benefit
light modulation in displays and sensor technologies.

Introduction
Photonic hydrogels,
which possess a three-dimensional polymer network
structure with periodic variations of refractive index, are potential
candidates for soft and tactile displays, sensor systems, packaging,
and advertising.1−10 The ordering present in these soft hydrogels causes them to exhibit
a “structural color” that can be reversibly tuned by
varying the periodic spacing through external stimuli such as stress,11−14 temperature,15−18 pH,19,20 and solvent exchange21−23 or by varying
the refractive index of the material.24 Therefore, photonic hydrogels are promising materials for displays
and sensors through utilizing stimuli-responsive structural colors
rather than requiring colored filters or additional optical elements.2 The structural color of materials that possess
one-dimensional photonic crystal structures or multilayer films8,25 shows distinct variations depending on viewing and light illumination
angles. In contrast, amorphous photonic structural arrays are responsible
for viewing-angle-independent colors.8 Angle-dependent
continuous color filtering allows the multicolor appearance of see-through
organic photovoltaics26 and plasmonic chips
for the construction of reflection-based spatial light modulators.27 On the other hand, changes in color associated
with viewing or illumination angle variation can also pose major challenges
for the development of full-color displays with wide viewing angles.8,24 Therefore, both tunable angle-dependent and angle-independent colors
in photonic materials are high in demand for optical devices. Researchers,
to date, have shown that materials having a short-range order in periodic
structures display angle-independent colors originating from a wavelength-specific
constructive interference in the visible region.28−30 Structurally
colored materials that exhibit angle-dependent colors most likely
possess long-range periodic structures.31−33 Takeoka reported angle-dependent
colors by constructing colloidal crystalline arrays and angle-independent
colors by assembling colloidal amorphous arrays.8 To the best of our knowledge, tuning between angle-dependent
and angle-independent colors by modifying the photonic nanostructure
in line with the bulk geometry has rarely been reported.

On
the basis of long-range periodic lamellar structures, we have
recently developed a tough photonic hydrogel that exhibits tunable
colors through various stimuli including stress, temperature, and
pH.34−40 The photonic hydrogel consists of an alternate packing of rigid
polymeric bilayers [self-assembly of amphiphilic poly(dodecyl glyceryl
itaconate) (PDGI)] and ductile polyacrylamide (PAAm) layers (Figure 1). Long-range periodic
photonic structures have been fabricated by shear-induced orientation
of dodecyl glyceryl itaconate (DGI) bilayer domains during preparation.
A gel precursor solution containing DGI monomers undergoes self-assembly
to form lamellar bilayers that can be aligned along the shear direction.
Given this ability, long-range ordering of lamellar bilayers can be
controlled by the geometry of the reaction cell, which determines
the shear flow of the precursor solution during injection. When the
precursor solution is injected into a rectangular reaction cell consisting
of two parallel glass plates, lamellar bilayers are aligned parallel
to the glass wall. Upon UV curing, hydrogel sheets are formed, where
lamellar bilayers uniaxially appeared along the sheet surface and
trapped between PAAm matrices (Figure 1, left). On the other hand, rod-shaped hydrogels, in
which bilayers form a concentric multicylindrical packing, have been
achieved by applying suction to a precursor solution into a cylindrical
polyethylene tube (Figure 1, right).

Figure 1 Schematic illustrations, preparation methods, and photographs
of
photonic hydrogel sheets (left) and rods (right). The photonic hydrogel
consists of self-assembled bilayers (several-nanometer thick) of PDGI
and ductile PAAm layers (few-hundred-nanometer thick). PDGI/PAAm gel
sheets were prepared by applying shear flow of the precursor solution
between two parallel glass plates prior to polymerization. On the
other hand, gel rods were fabricated by using suction to incorporate
the precursor solution into a polyethylene tube. PDGI bilayer sheets
are aligned parallel to the glass substrates for gel sheets and coaxially
to the cylindrical tubes for gel rods. The scale bars are ∼2
mm.

Herein, we report the fabrication
of composite hydrogels (PDGI/PAAm)
with variable photonic band gaps and the resulting angle-dependent
or angle-independent structural colors based on the specific photonic
nanostructure and bulk gel geometry. Gel sheets and rods of varying
photonic band gaps within the visible spectrum were fabricated by
controlling the swelling degree of the PAAm matrix. Photonic gel rods
exhibited angle-independent colors, in sharp contrast to gel sheets,
which showed strong angle dependence. The contrasting angle dependence
of both the gels is characterized by constructing rocking curves and
comparing their lamellar geometries. Despite various bulk geometries
with a distinct lamellar packing, both the gels are soft and ductile,
exhibiting high mechanical strength and toughness. Understanding the
relationship between the photonic nanostructure and the angle dependence
of these soft and tough hydrogels could impact the material design
for light modulation, visualization, optical sensing, and display
technologies.

Results and Discussion
Photonic
hydrogel sheets possess several thousands of rigid PDGI
lamellar bilayers stacked periodically into a soft and ductile PAAm
matrix. PDGI lamellae are entrapped in a chemically cross-linked PAAm
network by one-step polymerization in the presence of a small amount
of a chemical cross-linker. In the as-prepared state, gel sheets [0.1
M DGI, 2.0 M acrylamide (AAm), and 0.1 mol % N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBAA) of AAm] are almost
transparent and exhibit a pale violet color (Figure S1). However, visible colors appeared depending on the swelling
degree in pure water. PDGI bilayers are impermeable to water and other
hydrophilic molecular species. Because of the uniaxial orientation
of the PDGI bilayers, the water-permeable PAAm network can swell freely
in the direction perpendicular to the bilayers and the bulk thickness
of the gel sheet almost doubled. The swelling is related to the increase
in the PAAm layer thickness and a corresponding increase in the inter-bilayer
distance d, which leads to a red shift in the gel
color. The thickness of a single PDGI bilayer (dPDGI) was reported in the literature previously as ∼4.7
nm.41 Therefore, the thickness of each
PAAm layer (dPAAm) can be estimated from d. dPAAm of the water-swollen
gel sheet, which exhibits an orange-red color, is estimated as ∼250
nm. At room temperature, the single PDGI bilayer membrane is rigid
with a modulus on the order of several megapascals and the PAAm matrix
is soft with a modulus of few kilopascals.34,39 The refractive index of a PDGI bilayer membrane is considered to
be that of a lipid bilayer, which is reported in the range of 1.42–1.45.42 The refractive index of a PAAm layer is considered
to be ∼1.33 (the refractive index of water) as it contains
mostly water (98%).43 Therefore, the PDGI/PAAm
composite gel exhibits visible colors at various wavelength bands
because of the periodic refractive index variation of alternating
layers that satisfy the Bragg’s law for diffraction of visible
light.

The periodic lamellar spacing, d, of
the gel sheets
and correspondingly their color can be tuned by varying the DGI concentration
during preparation, mechanical stress, and so forth.34 In this work, d was varied by regulating
the PAAm layer thickness. This was achieved by controlling the swelling
degree of the PAAm matrix. The PDGI/PAAm gel sheets were prepared
at various cross-linking concentrations using MBAA as a cross-linker
in the PAAm network. The photographs of the gel sheets prepared with
various MBAA concentrations are shown in Figure 2a. With increasing MBAA concentration, a
blue shift is observed in accordance with the corresponding reflection
spectra, as shown in Figure 2b. The wavelength of maximum intensity (λmax) and bilayer spacing (d) decrease accordingly (Figure 2c). Therefore, a
shift in the gel color is attributed to the decrease in d. At a high cross-linking density, the swelling degree of the PAAm
matrix was reduced, which resulted in a decrease in d. The bulk swelling ratio along the thickness of the gel (T/T0) also decreased in accordance
with the d-ratio (d/d0) (Figure 2d), where T0 and d0 and T and d are the reference
states (as-prepared) and swollen states, respectively, for gels with
various cross-linking concentrations.

Figure 2 (a) Photographs of the gel sheets prepared
at various cross-linker
concentrations (MBAA) show a blue shift with an elevated MBAA content.
(b) Reflection spectra of the gels are measured at various cross-linker
concentrations. Both incident and detection angles (θ) were
set at 60° for the spectra measurements. (c) Wavelength of maximum
intensity (λmax) and interlamellar distance (d) are plotted as a function of cross-linker concentration. d was calculated from λmax using Bragg’s
law, 2nd sin θ = mλ,
where n, d, θ, m, and λ are the refractive index of water, periodic lamellar
spacing, Bragg’s angle, diffraction order, and wavelength of
diffracted light, respectively. (d) Bulk swelling ratio of gel thickness
(T/T0) and d-ratio (d/d0) are shown
as a function of cross-linker concentration, where T0 and d0 and T and d stand for the reference state (as-prepared)
and swollen state, respectively, of gels with various cross-linking
densities. Cross-linker concentrations are expressed as mol % with
respect to AAm molar concentrations. The scale bar is ∼5 mm.

The gel rods were prepared with
compositions identical to those
of the gel sheets (0.1 M DGI, 2.0 M AAm, and 0.1 mol % MBAA of AAm),
resulting in an almost transparent gel that exhibits a pale violet
color in the as-prepared state (Figure S1). However, the gel rods with a preparation composition identical
to that of the gel sheets appear greenish-blue after swelling in water.
The difference in color between swollen gel sheets and rods is due
to the swelling process. The gel sheets swelled in the thickness direction
by a factor of more than 2, whereas the gel rods swelled in the diameter
direction by less than a factor of 2.34,36 The bilayer
spacing, d, of the gel rods can also be varied by
controlling the swelling degree of the PAAm layer, which is achieved
by varying the concentrations of the cross-linker. The gel rod exhibits
a blue shift, similar to the gel sheet, at higher MBAA concentrations
(Figure 3a). The swelling
ratio of the gel rod in the diameter direction (D/D0) decreased with increasing MBAA concentration,
indicating a decrease in d as a result of the reduced
swelling of the PAAm matrix.

Figure 3 (a) Photographs of gel rods prepared at various
cross-linker concentrations
(MBAA) show a blue shift at a higher MBAA content. (b) Gel rod bulk
swelling ratios in the diameter direction (D/D0) decrease with increasing cross-linker concentration.
The scale bar is ∼2 mm.

The flat periodic lamellar structures in the gel sheets were
previously
confirmed by various techniques.34,39 In the present
work, polarizing optical microscopy (POM) images are shown to justify
the contrasting microstructure of both flat (gel sheet) and cylindrically
symmetric (gel rod) lamellar structures (Figure 4). The gel sheets were observed under cross-polarizers
in the presence of a tint plate (530 nm) using POM (Figure 4a). In the cross-sectional
view at 0° to the polarizer, the POM image appears magenta (Figure 4a(i)). However, the
images show orange (Figure 4a(ii)) and blue (Figure 4a(iii)) interference colors at −45° and
+45° rotations, respectively. These results indicate monodomain
lamellar bilayers in parallel to the top surface of the gel sheets.
The top-view images, which show solid magenta colors for all sample
angles, indicate no in-plane alignment, further justifying the in-plane
flat lamellae (Figure 4a(iv–vi)).

Figure 4 POM images of gel sheets (a) and rods (b). All of the
images are
taken under cross-polarizers in the presence of a tint plate (530
nm) [except for b(ii)]. The birefringence of the samples is assigned
to the monodomain bilayers and elongated PAAm chains because of the
anisotropic swelling. [a(i–iii)] Cross-sectional images of
a gel sheet at 0° to the polarizer (i) appear magenta but orange
at −45° (ii) and blue at +45° (iii), indicating uniaxially
aligned lamellae parallel to the top surface of the gel. [a(iv–vi)]
Top-view POM images of the gel sheet show only magenta color at all
angles when the sample stage is rotated, which indicates no in-plane
sheet lamellae. [b(i,ii)] Images taken from the cross-section of the
gel rod in the presence (i) and absence (ii) of a tint plate show
a Maltese cross, which clearly indicates the concentric alignment
of lamellae to form a multicylindrical packing. [b(iii–v)]
Images taken perpendicularly to the long axis of the rod (top view)
are completely magenta (iii) over the whole sample when placed at
0° to the polarizer but orange (iv) and blue (v), separated by
a solid magenta line, when placed at −45° and +45°,
respectively. This further indicates a large-scale concentric cylindrical
alignment of lamellae in the gel rods. The scale bars are 1.0 mm.

The rod-shaped gel was also observed
under cross-polarizers from
the top as well as from a cross-sectional view (Figure 4b). POM images, which were taken from the
cross-section of the rod in the presence (Figure 4b(i)) and absence (Figure 4b(ii)) of a tint plate, show a Maltase cross,
which clearly indicates a concentric alignment of bilayers along the
periphery of the rod. Large-scale concentric cylindrical lamellae
of the gel rods were further revealed by the POM images taken perpendicular
to the long axis of the rod. POM produces completely dark images over
the whole sample when the long axis of the rod was positioned in the
polarizer direction (Figure 4b(iii)). However, at −45° and +45° rotations,
orange and blue birefringences were observed, respectively, together
with a thin line of magenta color in the center along the long axis
(Figure 4b(iv,v)).
These birefringence micrographs clearly justify the existence of large-scale
cylindrical lamellae with a concentric alignment in the gel rods.

Although the gel sheets and rods possess a distinct bulk geometry
as well as internal nanostructured packing, they exhibit comparable
mechanical strength and toughness (Figure 5). Both the gels possess a modulus of ∼100
kPa and a work of extension on the order of several MJ m–3.

Figure 5 Nominal stress vs strain curves of a gel sheet and a gel rod indicate
comparable levels of mechanical properties. The modulus of both the
gels is ∼100 kPa. Compositions of these two gels at preparation
are identical (0.1 M DGI, 2.0 M AAm, and 0.1 mol % MBAA of AAm). The
deformation velocity was 200 mm/min.

To observe the angle dependence of the structural color,
real-time
movies and photographs of both gel sheets (0.1 mol % MBAA) and rods
in the red photonic band (0.025 mol % MBAA) were taken at different
viewing angles (Figure 6a,b and Movies S1 and S2). The gel sheet exhibits an orange-red color at a viewing
angle of 0°. The color changes from red to blue with increasing
viewing angle on both directions (±30, ±45, and ±60°)
(Figure 6a). This angle-dependent
behavior is similar to some natural phenomena such as soap bubbles,
beetle’s exoskeletons, and bird’s feathers.44−46 The gel rods, which possess an orange-red color at 0°, do not
undergo any noticeable shift in color by changing the viewing angle
in both directions, which is in sharp contrast to the sheets (Figure 6b and Movie S2). It should be noted here that we chose
gel rods of different preparation conditions (0.025 mol % MBAA) to
achieve a color identical to that of the gel sheet for the angle-dependent
study. Although long-range, flat multilayer structures produce high
angle dependence in the case of gel sheets, rods with cylindrical
lamellar structures exhibit negligible angle dependence, which is
analogous to the structural color in Morpho butterflies that show no angle dependence.24

Figure 6 Viewing
angle dependence of lamellar gels with different geometries.
(a) Photographs of gel sheets taken at various viewing angles in both
directions show a blue shift. (b) Photographs of gel rods taken at
various viewing angles in both directions exhibit no significant change
in color. Reflection spectra of the sheets (c) and rods (d) taken
at various viewing angles (θview) while keeping the
incident (θin) and reflection (θref) angles identical to 90 – θview (θin = θref = 90 – θview). The reflection peak of the gel sheets shifts from red to blue,
but that of the rods remains almost unchanged with increasing viewing
angle. (e) Change of λmax with the viewing angle
for both gel sheets and rods. The scale bars are 2.0 mm.

The reflection spectra of both gel sheets and rods
were measured
at various viewing angles using an angle-measuring reflection apparatus.
During the measurement, incident (θin) and reflection
(θref) angles were identical, where θin = θref (=90 – θview), where
θview is the viewing angle. The reflection spectra
of the gel sheets showed a blue shift in the peak wavelength (Figure 6c), whereas the peak
wavelength of the rods does not change with increasing θview (Figure 6d), which is in consistence with their appearance. The wavelength
at maximum intensity (λmax) for both the gels was
plotted as a function of θview and is demonstrated
in Figure 6e. A large
shift in the peak wavelength (∼120 nm) is observed for the
gel sheet by changing the viewing angle from 10 to 55°. In contrast,
no significant change in λmax for the gel rod is
observed. However, the peak intensity of the gel rod is much lower
than that of the sheet geometry. The angle dependence of the gels
is related to Bragg’s law, 2nd sin θ
= mλ, where n, d, θ, m, and λ are the refractive index
of water, periodic lamellar spacing, Bragg’s angle, diffraction
order, and wavelength of diffracted light, respectively.47−49 As the sheet geometry possesses flat lamellae, the Bragg’s
angle (θ) is equivalent to θin or (90 –
θview). According to Bragg’s law, lower wavelength
light is reflected at a smaller Bragg’s angle, which is why
a blue shift occurred in the gel sheet when observed at a higher viewing
angle. On the other hand, because the rod geometry possesses cylindrical
lamellae, incident/reflected light impinges on the circular lamellar
surface at various angles. Although the viewing angle is changed spatially,
the true angle of incidence and reflection with respect to the sample
position remains unchanged. Therefore, the phenomena of Bragg’s
diffraction do not vary upon rotation of the cylindrical lamellar
gel. Regardless of the sample position or viewing angle, incidence
and reflection always appeared at an angle of 90° on cylindrical
lamellae for the gel rods.

To quantitatively characterize the
angle dependence, we further
construct rocking curves where the incident (θin)
and detected (θref) beams with respect to the initial
position of samples were set in such a way that the angle between
the incident and detected beams (ω) remains fixed upon rocking
the sample (Figure 7a,b). Keeping ω = 50°, both the gel samples were rocked
at various angles (ψ).

Figure 7 Schematic representation of the reflection spectra
measurement
when the gel sheets (a) and rods (b) were rocked at different angles
(ψ). Reflection spectra of the gel sheet (c) and rod (d) taken
at various rocking angles (ψ). A significant decrease in the
peak intensity, even at small rocking angles, for the gel sheet was
noticed, whereas the peak intensity for the gel rod is almost independent
of the rocking angle. (e) Rocking curves, a plot of intensity ratio
(I/I0) vs rocking angle,
for both the sheet and rod geometries, where I and I0 represent the reflection peak intensities
at various rocking angles and at 0 rocking angle, respectively. The
angle between the incident beam and reflected light, ω, was
kept constant at 50°. (f) Full width at half-maximum (fwhm) for
the gel sheets and rods is also plotted as a function of rocking angle.

The reflection spectra of both
gels taken at various rocking angles
are shown in Figure 7c,d. The reflection peak intensity of the gel sheet falls sharply
by rocking the sample at a small angle of only ∼10°, whereas
a negligible change in the peak intensity is noticed for the rod while
rocking even at an angle of 30°. The rocking curves, intensity
ratio (I/I0) versus rocking
angle, for both gels are plotted, where I and I0 are the reflection peak intensities at various
rocking angles and at zero rocking angle, respectively (Figure 7e). A sharp rocking impact
is apparent for the gel sheets, whereas a broad impact can be seen
for the rods. The maximum intensity observed at 0 rocking angle for
the gel sheet confirms that lamellar bilayers are mostly aligned parallel
to the top surface. In the case of the gel rods, the angle of the
incident beam and detector remained unchanged with respect to the
sample position regardless of the rocking angle, indicative of angle-independent
structural colors. With the gel sheet, the incident and detection
angles with respect to the sample position always change with varying
rocking angle, demonstrating highly angle-dependent structural colors.
Similar results were obtained when the angle, ω, between the
incident and reflected beams is varied for both gels (Figure S2). Full width at half-maximum (fwhm)
for both gels is also plotted as a function of rocking angle in Figure 7f. The bilayer undulation
in the gel sheet may affect its rocking intensity distribution, whereas
there is negligible influence on rocking for the gel rod. Therefore,
the rocking curves clearly confirmed the distinct angle dependence
of both gels.

The distinct angle-dependent behavior has been
previously demonstrated
by constructing colloidal crystalline arrays or by assembling colloidal
amorphous arrays.8 These photonic systems
are isotropic on the macroscale and have limited applications because
their structure rarely influences their mechanical performances. Although
rolled-up multilayered photonic fibers25 show moderately improved mechanical functions, they exhibit only
angle-independent colors. On the other hand, our photonic gel system
is anisotropic (on both the macro- and microscales) and exhibits excellent
mechanical functions as well as color tunability and promising optical
occurrences by modifying the external geometry along with the internal
photonic nanostructure. Moreover, our photonic system could guide
us to understand the unique optical occurrences in nature as well
as various biological organisms, such as soap bubbles, beetles, fishes,
cuticles, butterflies, and some types of bird feathers.

Conclusions
Photonic hydrogels with tunable angle-dependent structural colors
have been developed, which is achieved by varying the bulk geometry
and their photonic nanostructures. Hydrogel sheets with uniform lamellar
domains exhibit strong angle-dependent structural colors, whereas
gel rods with concentric cylindrical lamellae show angle-independent
colors, in sharp contrast to the sheet geometry. Rocking curves have
been constructed to justify the diverse angle dependence of lamellar
photonic hydrogels with various bulk geometries. Both gel sheets and
rods with variable photonic band gaps have been fabricated by varying
the swelling degree of the PAAm layer. Despite varying the bulk geometry,
softness, and ductility, both gels exhibit high mechanical performances
and toughness. Owing to the soft and tough nature of these materials,
stimuli-responsive photonic band gap, and distinct angle dependence,
these promising photonic nanocomposite materials could be potentially
useful in display technologies and to uncover unique optical occurrences
in nature.

Experimental Section
Materials
An amphiphilic monomer,
DGI (n-C12H25–OCOCH2C(=CH2)COOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH), was synthesized
following the procedure described earlier.34 After completion of two-step reactions, the crude product was purified
at least twice by a silica gel column (silica gel 60 N, Kanto Chemical
Co., Inc.). The DGI fraction was eluted with a hexane/ethyl acetate
mixture (1:1 by volume) and was further purified twice by recrystallization
from an acetone/hexane mixture (1/1 by weight). MBAA was recrystallized
from ethanol, AAm was recrystallized from chloroform, and Irgacure
2959 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as received. Millipore
deionized water was used to prepare the monomer solutions and for
the swelling of the gel.

Preparation of Gel Sheets and Rods
PDGI/PAAm gel sheets
and rods were prepared by simultaneous free-radical polymerization
from an aqueous solution of 0.1 M DGI, 0.025 mol % SDS of DGI, 2 M
AAm, 0.025–5.0 mol % MBAA of AAm as a cross-linker, and 2 mM
Irgacure as an initiator.34,36 The precursor solution
was prepared by mixing all components which contained random microdomains
of self-assembled DGI lamellar bilayers dispersed in an AAm solution.
Gel sheets with flat lamellar bilayer structures parallel to the sheet
surface were fabricated by applying shear flow of an equilibrated
precursor solution between two parallel glass plates. Prior to polymerization,
the precursor solutions were injected in a rectangular-shaped glass
mold (100 × 10 × 0.5 mm3) at a shear rate of
∼200 s–1, where the two parallel glass plates
were separated by a 0.5 mm thick silicon spacer (Figure 1, left). Because of the strong
shear flow between the two parallel glass plates, random lamellar
bilayer domains were aligned in the direction parallel to the glass
substrate. After 8 h of UV polymerization, uniform, flat lamellae
were stacked periodically and entrapped in a chemically cross-linked
PAAm matrix to create the hydrogel sheet. On the other hand, PDGI/PAAm
gel rods were fabricated by using a polyethylene tube (1.0 mm diameter
and 200 mm long) as a reaction cell to apply strong shear flow along
the axial direction of the tube (Figure 1, right). The gel precursor solution was
prepared in the same manner as above. One end of the tube was immersed
in the precursor solution, and the other end was connected to a syringe.
Suction was applied to the precursor solution at a high speed (shear
rate > 200 s–1) until the tube was filled. Under
strong shear flow, random lamellar domains in the precursor solution
were oriented along the wall of the tube to form multicylinder lamellae.
The rod structure was stabilized in the PAAm matrix after 8 h of UV
polymerization. Both gels were immersed in water to achieve an equilibrium
swollen state.

Reflection Spectra Measurements
Variable angle reflection
measurement optics (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., C10027A10687) were used
for exposing the gels to white light and detecting the reflected light.
A xenon lamp was used as a light source to measure the reflection
spectrum. A photonic multichannel analyzer (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.,
C10027) was used for analyzing the detected signal. To observe the
angle-dependent color, the reflection spectra of the gel samples were
measured at various viewing angles (θview) while
setting both incident (θin) and reflection (θref) angles to 90 – θview (θin = θref = 90 – θview). Reflection spectra measurements for the rocking curves were performed
by rocking the sample in both directions (Figure 7a,b). The incident beam angle (θin) and detection angle (θref) with respect
to the initial sample position were set in such a way that the angle
between the incident beam and the detector (ω) remained unchanged
during rocking. When ω = 50°, θin = θref = 65° at 0 rocking angle (ψ). At ψ = 5°,
ω = 50° and θin = 60° while θref = 70°.

Tensile Test
Tensile stress–strain
properties
of both gel sheets and rods were measured with a commercial test machine
(Tensilon RTC-1310A, Orientec Co.). Prior to testing, the gel sheets
were cut into a dumbbell-shaped standardized size with a gel cutter
(JIS-K6251-7) in such a way that the tensile elongation could be performed
parallel to the top surface of the gel, that is, in the direction
along the lamellae. The gel rods were clamped as is. The distance
between the two clamps was considered as the initial length of the
gel rod. Deformation was applied along the long axis of the gel rod.
The stretching velocity was 200 mm/min for both gels.
