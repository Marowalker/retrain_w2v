With
the aim of developing efficient and useful processes for the
preparation of polycyclic organic compounds, intramolecular [3 + 2]
photoreactions of 9-cyanophenanthrene-linked arylcyclopropanes were
investigated. Photoreactions of 6a,b, which contain respective p-methoxyphenylcyclopropane and phenylcyclopropane moieties,
form the intramolecular [3 + 2] photocycloadducts, endo- and exo-7a,b, along with the dihydroisochroman derivatives, cis- and
trans-8a,b. The efficiency of the photoreaction of 6a is higher when benzene rather than acetonitrile is used
as a solvent. Interestingly, this solvent effect is reversed in the
photoreaction of 6b, where the efficiency is higher in
acetonitrile than that in benzene. On the basis of the observed effects
of substituents and solvents, fluorescence emission from intramolecular
exciplexes, and ΔGs for intramolecular single
electron transfer (SET), we propose that the photoreactions proceed
through pathways involving the initial formation of singlet intramolecular
exciplexes and/or SET between the excited 9-cyanophenanthrene and
the ground-state arylcyclopropane moieties.

Introduction
Photocycloaddition
reactions between unsaturated compounds, such
as alkenes, alkynes, allenes, 1,3-dienes, and arenes, are useful for
the preparation of polycyclic organic compounds. As a result, these
processes have been extensively studied from both synthetic and mechanistic
perspectives.1 We envisioned that cyclopropane
derivatives would be interesting replacements for the unsaturated
compounds employed in these photocycloaddition reactions because they
would serve as precursors of C3 units in the generated polycylic products.
To date, studies of [3 + 2] photocycloaddition reactions of cyclopropanes
with alkenes have focused on processes involving the additions of
methylenecyclopropanes to tetracyanoethylene,2 triarylcyclopropanes to vinyl ethers,3 vinylidenecyclopropanes to electron-deficient alkenes,4 and tricyclo[3.3.0.02,8]octan-3-ones
to 2-trimethylsiloxybutadiene.5 In addition,
intramolecular photoreactions of pentacyclo[6.3.1.13,6.02,7.09,11]tridec-4-ene6 and photocatalytic [3 + 2] cycloaddition of benzoylcyclopropanes
with alkenes in the presence of Ru catalysts and Lewis acids7 have been probed. However, only a few reports
exist which describe the photoreactions of cyclopropanes with arenes.
Included in the processes explored thus far are [4 + 3] photocycloaddition
reactions of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene with 1,2-diarylcyclopropanes,8 1-amino-2-phenylcyclopropanes,9 and methylenecyclopropanes;10 [3 + 2] photocycloaddition reactions of 9-cyanophenanthrene with
1,2-diarylcyclopropanes;11 and [3 + 2]
photocycloaddition reactions of 1-phenyl-2-vinylcyclopropanes with
C60.12

In contrast to
their intermolecular counterparts, intramolecular
reactions often proceed with increased efficiencies and high levels
of regio- and stereoselectivity owing to the entropic and preorientaion
effects.13 We have also encountered these
phenomena in recent studies of linked naphthalene-cyclopropane derivatives
that undergo intramolecular [3 + 2] and [4 + 3] photocycloaddition
reactions with high levels of regio- and stereochemical control.14 The earlier results prompted us to investigate
the photochemistry of 9-cyanophenanthrene–arylcyclopropane-linked
systems because of several reasons including the expectations that
the extended π-system in the phenanthrene ring would enable
ready formation of intramolecular exciplexes15 and that reactions of the exciplexes would lead to complex polycyclic
ring systems that are difficult to prepare using other approaches.
In an effort driven by these considerations, we observed that photoreactions
of 9-cyanophenanthrene-linked arylcyclopropanes lead to the production
of intramolecular [3 + 2] photocycloadducts along with unexpected
dihydroisochroman derivatives. The results of this investigation are
described below.

Results and Discussion
The 9-cyanophenanthrene-linked
arylcyclopropanes 6a–d used in this study were
designed and synthesized in expectation
of moderate π–π and donor–acceptor (D–A)
interactions of aryl groups (Scheme 1). Bromination of 9-methylphenanthrene 1a and its derivatives 1b,c produced 2a–c whose methyl groups were further brominated to give 3a–c, respectively. Williamson ether synthesis of 3a–c with cinnamyl alcohols followed by cyanation and cyclopropanation
gave the substances 6a–d.

Scheme 1 Preparation of 9-Cyanophenanthrene-Linked
Arylcyclopropanes 6a–d
Solutions containing 6a–d in Pyrex
vessels
were degassed by argon bubbling, sealed, and irradiated by using a
300 or 450 W high-pressure mercury lamp (>280 nm). Separation of
each
crude product mixture using silica gel column chromatography followed
by recycling preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
led to the isolation of four photoproducts including the expected
pentacyclic derivatives endo-7 and exo-7 arising by intramolecular [3 + 2] photocycloaddition and the unexpected
tetracyclic dihydroisochromans cis-8 and trans-8 (Scheme 2 and Table 1). The
structure of trans-8a was determined by using X-ray crystallographic
analysis (Figure 1),
and those of the other products were determined by comparing their
spectroscopic and analytical data with those of trans-8a and substances characterized in previous studies of intermolecular
photoreactions of arenes with cyclopropanes.11,14

Photoreaction of 6a, in which the 9-cyanophenanthrene
moiety is linked to a p-methoxyphenylcyclopropane
group through an ether bridge, in benzene produces four photoproducts
in yields that gradually increase with increasing reaction time (entries
1–3). In this process, endo-7a and trans-8a are produced in higher yields than exo-7a and
cis-8a, and as expected, the overall yields of the products
are higher when a 450 W high-pressure mercury lamp is used instead
of a 300 W lamp (entry 4). In contrast, photoreaction of 6a in acetonitrile takes place less efficiently, leading to 70% recovery
of 6a even after 288 h of irradiation (entry 5).

This solvent change has a reverse effect on the photoreaction of 6b, in which the 9-cyanophenanthrene group is linked to a
phenylcyclopropane moiety. In this case, the photoreaction proceeds
smoothly in acetonitrile but only sluggishly in benzene and CH2Cl2 (entries 6–8). In addition, in contrast
to that of 6a, the photoreaction of 6b generates
a more complex product mixture containing 9-cyano-10-methylphenanthrene
(9) and other unidentified substances.

The respective
substrates 6c and 6d,
which have a second cyano group at either C-6 or C-3 of the phenanthrene
ring system, were explored in this effort to determine the effects
of enhancing D–A interactions in intramolecular exciplexes
on the course of these processes. However, photoreactions of these
substances were found to occur highly inefficiently in benzene and
acetonitrile (entries 9–13), and the only products isolated
from the former process are the [3 + 2] photocycloadduct endo-7d and dihydroisochroman trans-8c.

Absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopic studies were carried
out to gain information about the nature of the excited states of
9-cyanophenanthrene-linked arylcyclopropanes. UV absorption spectra
of 10–4 M benzene and acetonitrile solutions of 6a–d were recorded and compared to those of 9-cyanophenanthrene
(10) (Figure 2). The absorption maxima of 6a (317 nm) and 6b (317 nm) in benzene occur at 3 nm longer wavelengths than
that of 10 (314 nm), and the absorption maxima of the
dicyano derivatives 6c (325 nm) and 6d (329
nm) are shifted to even longer wavelengths. The UV absorption spectra
of 6a–d and 10 in acetonitrile display
changes that are similar to those in benzene. Because the absorption
bands of 6a–d are attributed to phenanthrene chromophore,
the phenanthrene part is electronically excited by irradiation under
the present photoreaction conditions (>280 nm).

(10) in (a) benzene and (b) acetonitrile, 1.0 ×
10–4 M.

Fluorescence spectra of 10–4 M benzene
and acetonitrile
solutions of 6a–d and 10 are displayed
in Figure 3. Unlike
the absorption spectra of these substances, their fluorescence spectra
show large solvent dependencies. The observation that the fluorescence
band of 6b has a shape and position similar to that of 10 in both benzene and acetonitrile demonstrates that it has
a phenanthrene-localized singlet excited (LE; locally excited) state
and that this excited state is less quenched by the tethered phenylcyclopropane
group. On the other hand, emission from the LE state of 6a in benzene is quenched, and weak intramolecular exciplex emission
occurs in the 400–500 nm region, whose maximum is estimated
to be 429 nm by a subtracted spectrum (Figure S1). Moreover, emission from the LE state of 6a in acetonitrile is even more profoundly quenched, but intramolecular
exciplex emission is not observed. In the fluorescence spectra of 6c,d, the degrees of quenching of the LE states of 6c and 6d in benzene are larger than that of 6a, and respective intramolecular exciplex emission bands with maxima
at 442 (6c) and 462 (6d) nm are more intense.
The excitation spectra of 6a–d at fluorescence
bands of LE states and intramolecular exciplexes correspond reasonably
well with the absorption spectra (Figure S2). These observations suggest that the phenanthrene LE states of 6a,c and 6d are quenched by the formation of
intramolecular exciplexes in benzene. The fact that fluorescence emission
from intramolecular exciplexes of 6c,d is more prominent
than that from 6a suggests that exciplexes serving as
intermediates in the pathways for the photoreactions are nonemissive,
whereas unreactive exciplexes fluoresce. Finally, in acetonitrile,
quenching of the LE singlet states might involve single electron transfer
(SET).

Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanistic
pathways are known16 to be followed in
intermolecular photoreactions
of arylcyclopropanes with cyanoarenes in acetonitrile. To evaluate
the possibility that PET proceeds in the intramolecular photoreactions
of 6, free energy changes (ΔG)
for SET from arylcyclopropanes to the excited singlet state of 9-cyanophenanthrene
(10) were estimated by using the Rehm–Weller equation17 (Table 2). On the basis of the oxidation potentials of p-methoxyphenylcyclopropane (11a) and phenylcyclopropane
(11b) and the reduction potential and excited singlet
energy of 9-cyanophenanthrene (10), the ΔG values for SET were calculated to be −13.4 (11a) and −5.1 (11b) kcal/mol. The negative
ΔG values indicate that SET can occur when
mixtures of these substrates, especially 10 and 11a, or their tethered counterparts are irradiated in acetonitrile
solutions.

The results described
above enable us to propose plausible mechanisms
for the solvent effects on the photoreactions described above (Scheme 3). Irradiation of
9-cyanophenanthrene-linked arylcyclopropanes 6 results
in the production of 9-cyanophenanthrene LE singlet states 12. In the route for the photoreaction of 6a in benzene,
two diastereomeric exciplexes up-13 and down-13 formed from 12 undergo C–C bond formation at
C-10 of phenanthrene ring to generate the respective biradicals cis-14 and trans-14. Alternatively, C–C bond
formation at the 9-position of the phenanthrene ring in 13 produces the corresponding biradicals cis-15 and trans-15. Intramolecular C–C bond formation in biradical
cis-14 gives the intramolecular [3 + 2] photocycloadducts
endo-7 and exo-7. In contrast, trans-14 cannot undergo intramolecular radical coupling to give 16 because of the development of much higher ring strain associated
with the formation of the trans-fused bicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton
than that of the cis-fused bicyclo[3.3.0]octane counterpart.20 Instead, intramolecular hydrogen transfer in
biradicals cis-15 and trans-15 takes place
to produce cis-8 and trans-8, respectively.
The cis-configuration of the double bonds of 8 may support
an assumption that the π–π interaction of arenes
also acts at the hydrogen transfer process. Thus, the product formation
in these photochemical processes occurs in a stepwise manner similar
to related intermolecular processes.11

Scheme 3 Mechanistic Pathways for the Photoreactions of 6a–d
The low reactivity of 6b in benzene appears to be
a consequence of an inadequate D–A interaction that is required
for the formation of intramolecular exciplexes. This proposal is supported
by the fact that emission is only observed from the LE singlet state
of 6b and not from intramolecular exciplexes. In the
reactions of 6 in acetonitrile, intramolecular radical
ion pairs 17, generated by PET, could be involved in
forming biradicals 14 and 15 in competition
with undergoing back electron transfer (BET) to regenerate 6. Particularly, the fact that photoreaction of 6a does
not occur in acetonitrile might be a consequence of fast BET. In the
reaction of 6b in acetonitrile, both mechanisms are possible,
because ΔG value for SET is less negative,
and the exciplex with weak D–A interaction may be more stabilized
in acetonitrile than in benzene. Finally, the low reactivities of
dicyanophenanthrene-linked arylcyclopropanes 6c and 6d can be attributed to either the existence of strong D–A
interactions causing the intramolecular exciplexes in benzene to be
too stable or the operation of highly efficient PET followed by fast
BET in acetonitrile.

Conclusions
In the effort described
above, we uncovered the first examples
of intramolecular photocycloaddition reactions of substrates containing
linked cyclopropanes and phenanthrene ring systems. Distinct substituent
and solvent effects are observed to govern the efficiencies of photoreactions
that produce [3 + 2] photocycloadducts endo- and exo-7a and unexpected dihydroisochroman derivatives cis- and trans-8. The observations along with those arising from the fluorescence
studies show that both intramolecular exciplex formation and PET are
involved in these processes. Although the uncovered [3 + 2] photocycloaddition
reactions, which utilize cyclopropanes as C3 units, serve as useful
methods to prepare highly complex, polycyclic five-membered ring-containing
compounds, the current processes do not have high enough efficiencies
and chemoselectivities to have practical applications in synthesis.
Further studies are underway to develop the synthetic potential of
this strategy.

Photoreaction of 6d (Table 1, Entry 11)
Benzene solutions (10
mL × 8) containing 6d (42 mg × 8) in eight
cylindrical Pyrex vessels (ϕ = 12 mm) were degassed by argon
bubbling for 10 min, and then the vessel was sealed. The solution
was irradiated by using a 450 W high-pressure mercury lamp (Ushio,
UM-452) at rt for 24 h, maintained by using circulated cooling water.
The combined solutions were concentrated in vacuo. Purification by
silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2–AcOEt
= 40:1) followed by recycling preparative HPLC (silica gel, normal
phase, hexane–AcOEt = 3:1) gave endo-7d (33 mg,
10% yield).
