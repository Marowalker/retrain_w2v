T-20 peptide is the first FDA-approved
fusion inhibitor against
AIDS/HIV-1 gp41 protein. Part of it, the gp41[659–671] peptide,
that contains the complete epitope for the neutralizing 2F5 monoclonal
antibody, has been found experimentally in a number of divergent structures.
Herein, we attempt to reconcile them by using unbiased large-scale
all-atom molecular dynamics folding simulations. We show that our
approach can successfully capture the peptide’s heterogeneity
and reach each and every experimentally determined conformation in
sub-angstrom accuracy, whilst preserving the peptide’s disordered
nature. Our analysis also unveils that the minor refinements within
the AMBER99SB family of force fields can lead to appreciable differences
in the predicted conformational stability arising from subtle differences
in the helical- and β-region of the Ramachandran plot. Our work
underlines the contribution of molecular dynamics simulation in structurally
characterizing pharmacologically important peptides of ambiguous structure.

1 Introduction
Deletions
or mutations in the tryptophan-rich C-terminal region
(residues 660–683) of the AIDS/HIV-1 gp41 protein can prevent
fusion with the host cell membrane.1,2 This region
of gp41 encompasses the synthetic peptide T-20 that corresponds to
residues 638–673, which has been approved by the FDA (under
the names Fuzeon or Enfuvirtide) as the first fusion inhibitor targeting
gp41 with an EC50 of 1 ng/mL denoting a new class of anti-HIV
drugs that prevent infection of new cells.3−7 Part of T-20 is the gp41[659–671] peptide
which contains the complete epitope (sequence ELDKWA) for the broad-spectrum
neutralizing 2F5 monoclonal antibody.8−11 Notably, the affinity of the
2F5 antibody is reduced after the binding between gp120 and CD4, suggesting
that the gp41[659–671] epitope is solvent exposed in the prefusogenic
form but becomes less accessible or restructured after fusion.12−14 It is for these reasons that the solution structure (in prefusogenic
form) of the gp41[659–671] has been long recognised as being
important for the development of new peptide antigens targeting AIDS/HIV
infection.

The structure and dynamics of the gp41[659–671]
peptide
in solution are a source of controversy in the literature. The NMR/CD
study by Anglister’s group15 showed
that the peptide takes-up a mostly 310-helical conformation
in solution and based on a sufficient number of NOE restraints they
deposited their structure (PDB entry 1LCX), lending support to previously published
CD data.16 Later UV resonance Raman scattering
studies revealed instead a variety of motifs, with half the peptide
bonds in helical conformation (mainly 310 and π-helix,
less α-helix) and the rest in extended and unfolded conformations
(mainly β-turn and polyproline II).17 Follow-up studies by Pessi’s group using a combination of
experimental and computational approaches suggested that the initially
proposed 310-helical structure by Anglister’s group
may be an error: their NMR (PDB entry 1MZI) and CD data suggested that the peptide
is mostly disordered, spanning an ensemble of conformers, including
helices and turns.18 On top of that, Crain’s
group argued as well for a conformational plasticity using a combination
of CD and MD data.19,20 However, there was inconsistency
even between the experimental findings with their MD data. The group
chose for the simulations the CHARMM force field, which has repeatedly
been demonstrated to suffer from an α-helical bias.21−27 The result was that only at elevated temperatures their MD data
were in qualitative agreement with the experiment, whereas the β-turn
motif suggested by Pessi’s group was found unstable.19 Furthermore in a later study, the peptide was
found to exhibit autonomous helical folding in the presence of membrane
mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles, which was tunable by pH
variation, a behaviour that was not observed in aqueous solutions.20

Given the indications for the highly dynamic
nature of the gp41[659–671]
peptide in solution a direct experimental attack on elucidating the
peptide’s structure has been problematic. Herein, we aim to
study the folding behaviour of this malleable peptide using unbiased
large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. Using a previously
validated force field25−33 coupled with an adaptive tempering protocol and a sufficient simulation
length to guarantee the convergence of the peptide’s derived
atomic structures we attempt to thoroughly characterise its structure
and dynamics. We show that simulations can bridge the gap among divergent
structure determinations by reaching in sub-angstrom accuracy every
experimentally available peptide structure, whilst preserving its
disordered nature. Detailed analysis of the simulations interestingly
showed that even the best performing force fields still suffer from
imbalance between the different secondary structural elements. This
diversity seems to impact inadvertently the accurate structural characterisation
of highly dynamic peptides such as gp41[659–671]. Our simulations
contribute to a better characterisation of the structure and dynamics
of this pharmacologically and therapeutically important peptide and
to the unceasing refinement of current generation force fields.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Heterogeneity
of the T-20 Derived
gp41[659–671] Peptide
Even a cursory examination of
the collection of structures deposited in the PDB database (Figure 1 and Table S1) reveals that the structures of the
T-20 derived peptide, from the 7-mer to the 17-mer, free (PDB entry 1LCX,15 PDB entry 1MZI(18)) or in complex with the 2F5 antibody
(PDB entries 1TJG, 1TJH, 1TJI(34)) can vary from helical to turn to almost fully extended.

diversity of the T20 peptide. Schematic diagram of a
collection of peptide structures deposited in the PDB database that
entail the sequence of the T20 peptide, corresponding to residues
[659–671] of gp41. All structures are superimposed on the central
ELDKWA epitope. Secondary structural elements are highlighted using
cartoon representation and color coded using STRIDE-derived secondary
structure assignments (as shown in the color-box). More information
on the sequence context and the structure determination details are
provided in Table S1.

Turn structures seem to be the dominant population when the
peptide
7-mer, 9-mer, 11-mer or 13-mer is in complex with the 2F5 monoclonal
antibody (PDB entries 1U8I, 1U8J, 1U8K, 2F5B, 2P8L, 2P8M, 2P8P, 3D0V, 3DRO, 3DRQ, 3DRT, 3MOA, 3MOB, 3MOD(35−37)). It is worth
mentioning however the inconsistency among the studies regarding the
resolution of the electron density data for the C-terminal residues 668SLWN671. This was attributed to either the end-capping
of the peptide through amidation that deprives the extra end-charge
or to the extension of the end by just a couple of residues (670WN671). In both cases, the formation of a key
hydrogen bond of the peptide’s end with the heavy chain of
the antibody stabilises the C-terminal part of the peptide.36 This conformational stabilisation was found
particularly persistent under high ionic strength conditions (PDB
entry 3D0L(36)) mostly due to an additional intrachain hydrogen
bond between the carbonyl oxygen of 666Trp with the backbone
amide of 669Leu (i, i + 4), denoting the start of an α-helix extending through the
C-terminus. This helix is also observed in the longer peptides (PDB
entries 2LP7, 2M7W, 2M8M, 2M8O, 2ME1, 2PV6, 3MNW, 3MNZ, 4G6F, 4NRX(38−43)).

Indeed, helical structures seem to be favoured in the larger
context
like in the 59-mer, that is extended towards the N-terminus this time
to include the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), especially
in the lipid environment of the viral membrane, with a bend around
the epitope to expose the amino acids involved in the antibody binding
(PDB entries 2LP7, 2M7W, 4G6F, 4NRX(38,42,43)). A significant helical tendency for the
gp41[657–669] peptide fragment in water was also found in later
studies by the Anglister group in the longer gp41[636–677]
peptide, with the preceding N-terminal part unstructured.44

Both findings regarding turn and helical
preferences were confirmed
by later studies in non-aqueous environments revealing the folding
of the 28-mer gp41[656–683] to a continuous kinked helix (PDB
entries 2M8M, 2M8O(39)) whilst shorter or longer peptides showed non-continuous
partial structuring to 310 and α-helix. In particular,
the kink comprised residues 665KW666 preceded
by 310-helical conformation for residues 661LEL663, consistent with the type I β-turn for the 664DKW666 core epitope sequence. This kink or tilt
in the N-terminal α-helix (664–672, MPER region) that
connects via a short hinge to the flat C-terminal helical segment
(675–683) was observed by yet another group (PDB entries 2ME1, 2PV6(40,41)) and it was also observed when the peptide was in complex with another
broad neutralising antibody, 10E8 (PDB entry 4G6F(42)). In this case, the N-terminal α-helix extends from
residues 657–667, tightens to a 310-helix for 668SL669 followed by a turn for 670WN671 to continue to the C-terminal α-helix for residues
672–683. This longer peptide displayed also an independent
capability to interact with a membrane surface, with different segmental
secondary structures being adopted during the fusion process. The
bias towards helical folding seems to be pH tuned, with no defined
fold type at basic pH and helical near physiological and acidic pH
environment.20

The common characteristic
amongst all helical structures is the
exposure of five key residues 660Leu, 663Leu, 664Asp, 665Lys, 666Trp, with the last
three involved directly in antibody binding (pdb entry 4NRX(43)). It seems that antibody recognition requires a continuous
helical structure interrupted by a flexible kink/turn/loop conformation
for residues 664DKW666 that redirects the gp41
backbone at the pre-transmembrane region, thus orienting the 666Trp and 669Leu side-chains in parallel and the 664Asp side-chain negative charge projecting from the main
chain axis in different direction.39,43 This crucial
involvement of side-chain interactions gives the epitope specificity.
In total, the conformation of residues 651LELDKWAS668 when bound to neutralizing antibodies is conserved in most
observed structures, whereas the conformation of residues 669LW670 varies significantly, like in structures 2P8P, 1TJH, and 3D0L.36 One of the most distinct structures is that of a 310-helix supported by the seminal study of Anglister’s
group.15 This type of helix was attributed
mainly to the strong presence of an i, i + 3 hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of 664Asp
and the amide proton of 667Ala together with 3JHNα coupling constants and chemical
shifts supporting helical conformations and only minor populations
of random coil, arguing that the presence of this hydrogen bond could
be key to deter antibody interaction. Indeed it seems that the most
potent short constrained peptides that inhibit HIV-1 entry are not
the ones with high helical propensity.45 Both proper 664DKW666 β-turn conformation
and side-chain positioning are crucial for designing immunogens capable
of eliciting neutralizing antibodies.

2.2 Excellent
Agreement between Experimental and
Simulation-Derived Structures
The performance of the force
fields against folding a peptide with such divergent structures is
examined in Figure 2. By using a straightforward root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) calculation,
we can identify simulation-derived structures that match each one
of the experimental structures to sub-angstrom accuracy. Some of the
structures are scarcely visited, as expected due to lesser secondary
structural content and consequently increased dynamics. These structures
are expected to be further stabilised in the presence of the interacting
antibody. On the other hand, helical populations seem to be preferred
for this isolated peptide in solution, even though the length of the
peptide is smaller compared to the experimental ones’ for which
helical conformations were found (see Table S1 for respective peptide lengths per structure). In general, we observe
a high agreement on the relative percentage preference for each experimental
structure among the two force fields. This means that the delicate
balance between helical, beta, turn and coil structures is preserved,
as expected for two so closely related force field versions. However,
it cannot be overlooked that the ILDN* force field gives constantly
higher representation of all the structures. This phenomenically better
performance cannot be fully evaluated since its highly disordered
nature prevents an accurate description of the peptide’s folding
landscape. Nonetheless, when it comes to describe the stable peptide
conformations, the ILDN* force field presents itself as a better choice.

Figure 2 Similarity
to experimental structures. Superposition of the closest
simulation-derived structure for the ILDN (left) and ILDN* (right)
force fields to each one of the experimentally known structures (see
also Figure 1 and Table S1). Secondary structural elements are
highlighted using cartoon representation and color coded using STRIDE-derived
secondary structure assignments as in Figure 1. The experimental structures are overlayed
in transparency for clarity. The occupancy of each ensemble of structures
is noted next to each PDB code. The occupancies were calculated using
an rmsd cut-off of 2.0 Å as determined from the rmsd histogram
distributions in Figure S1, over the stable
conformations of the trajectory (T < 340 K).

To elaborate further, the two
earliest solution NMR structures
of the 13-mer peptide, 1LCX(15) and 1MZI,18 although they are the closest to our simulation system,
they seem to present only a fraction of the peptide’s available
conformations, occupying 10–30% of the stable conformers (see
also Figure S1). The 310-helix
in particular, was proposed after using the 664Asp–667Ala hydrogen bond as a restrain, as mentioned in the previous
sections. This hydrogen bond even though is observed, is not persistent
(see also Figure S2). In the simulation
with the ILDN force field, that hydrogen bond is present in 57% of
the low-temperature associated frames (22% of the total simulation
time) and in the simulation with the ILDN* force field, in 88% of
the low-temperature associated frames (33% of the total simulation
time). This implies that the presence of that hydrogen bond is not
enough to restrain the conformation to a 310-helix, as
the persistence of the hydrogen bond is 3–4 times higher than
the occupancy of this set of structures. The imposition of this restrain
could thus affect the accurate determination of a representative NMR
ensemble.

Likewise, turn structures that are observed in the
context of the
short 7-mer, 9-mer and 11-mer in complex with the 2F5 antibody are
restrained by 3 intrapeptide hydrogen bonds (Figure S2). These hydrogen bonds constrain the peptide to a straight
conformation with side-chain arrangement that favors antibody recognition.34,35 Apparently one of them, between 664Asp–667Ala, is the same one that contributes to the 310-helix
formation discussed above. The second hydrogen bond between 666Trp–669Leu, is quite persistent as well, being
present in 65% of the low-temperature associated frames (26% of the
total simulation time) for the ILDN force field and in 86% of the
low-temperature associated frames (32% of the total simulation time)
for the ILDN* force field. This hydrogen bond, as discussed in the
previous section, was often associated with the initiation of an α-helix
extending through the C-terminus of the longer peptides. On the other
hand, the third hydrogen bond between 664Asp–666Trp is quite scarce with only 2.2% presence in the low-temperature
associated frames (0.9% of the total simulation time) for the ILDN
force field and 1.8% presence in the low-temperature associated frames
(0.7% of the total simulation time) for the ILDN* force field. This
last hydrogen bonds seems to “lock” the 664DKW666 β-turn conformation that is crucial for antibody
recognition. Thereby, these short turn structures comprising the central
peptide epitope residues are visited more often, with 35–45%
occupancy, whilst peptide structures with mixed turn/coil conformations
along the whole peptide length are still visited but with occupancies
of around 5%.

Helical conformations persist longer, with occupancies
of no less
than 25% that can reach up to 66% of simulation time (accounting for
the low-temperature associated frames). This seems contradictory to
the fact that the peptide is found experimentally in helical conformations
only in a larger context (21-mer to 59-mer) and either in complex
with an antibody or in membrane-mimicking environment. It seems though
that there is an intrinsic helical preference for this isolated 13-mer
peptide in aqueous solutions as well. If this is the case, then such
a computational approach to characterise the full ensemble of available
structures for a highly disordered peptide as this, is extremely valuable
as it presents all the peptide’s accessible conformations with
their relative stabilities and preferences.

Closing this section
of successfully reproducing all available
experimental structures, it is worth mentioning that no other significant
population (with occupancy of more than 1% of the low-temperature
associated frames) of stable structures was found during our simulations,
that differed by more than 2 Å from at least one of the experimental
structures included in the collection of structures in Figure 1.

2.3 Differential
Secondary Structure Preferences
between ILDN and ILDN* Force Fields
From a general perspective,
the ILDN and ILDN* simulations show an overall agreement on the preferred
peptide structures, in the sense that they give similar relative representation
of the helical structures, over the turn/coil ones, with minimal interstitial
β-structures. This is nicely captured in Figure 3, where we calculate the per residue secondary
structural preferences for the two force fields. A closer look reveals
that the first and last couple of residues are quite flexible, as
expected for such a short peptide. On the other hand, the central
part of the peptide comprising the 651LELDKWAS668 epitope sequence shows some discrepancy between the two force fields.
The preference for turn conformation of each residue is preserved
among them but there is difference in the preference for α-helix
and 310-helix. The ILDN* force field is prone to helical
conformations overall, as is also observed in the per residue secondary
structure analysis over time (Figure S3, bottom panel). But this helical preference is closer to an α-helix
and lesser to a 310-helix, the last one being more favoured
by the ILDN force field. Likewise, most of the helical experimental
structures (9 out of 30) are found in α-helical conformations,
a couple of them present with a combination of turn and 310-helix and only one (out of 30) folds to a 310-helix,
as discussed previously. From this perspective, ILDN* force field
seems to capture this behaviour more accurately. Nonetheless, the
balance between these conformations is critical for accurate representation
of the peptide’s conformations which can play a role in antibody
recognition and interaction.

Figure 3 Secondary structure preferences of the gp41[659–671]
peptide.
Weblogo-like representation of the per residue STRIDE-derived secondary
structure assignments for ILDN (left) and ILDN* (right) force fields,
calculated for all the trajectory. The symbols used correspond to
coil (C, grey), turn (T, blue), 310-helix (G, purple),
α-helix (H, magenta), extended β (E, yellow) and bridge
(B, tan).

To explore further the source
of this discrepancy, we calculated
the fraction of each secondary structure assignment for each residue
as a function of temperature (Figure S4). This updated view reveals that α-helical conformations are
favourably assigned to the central part of the peptide by both force
fields, but they are more stable in the case of the ILDN* force field,
as supported by the higher occupancy in the low temperature regime
(see blue-coloured region in the difference-plot in the middle column).
These same residues have a higher preference for 310-helix
in the ILDN force field simulation, whilst ILDN* force field assigns
a small 310-helical population only to residues in the
right end part of the epitope sequence (notice the two small red and
blue regions in the difference-plot in the middle column). On the
other hand, β-structures are not observed in any of the experimentally
determined peptide structures (Figure 1). The ILDN* force field again seems to represent this
feature better as they are only slightly visited at elevated temperatures
(note also the almost complete absence of β-structures in the
per residue secondary structure assignment over simulation time in Figure S3, bottom panel). On the contrary, ILDN
force field allows the peptide to accommodate these structures at
low temperatures, and particularly for residues in both the ends of
the central epitope sequence, 660LL661 and 668SL669 (Figures 3, S3, and S4). On the other
hand, turn and coil preferences among the two force fields seem very
comparable with no outstanding differences, apart from some slightly
higher preference for turn conformation on the N-terminal part and
for coil conformation on the C-terminal part of the peptide by the
ILDN* force field.

ILDN’s bias over 310-helix
is illustrated in
the dihedral angle calculation presented in Figure 4 (see also the per residue Ramachandran plots
and corresponding difference-Ramachandran plots in Figure S5). In these Ramachandran plots, the prevalence of
helical populations is clear, but with subtle differences in the exact
area that is occupied: ILDN’s helical population tends more
to 310-helix (note the slightly raised values in the helical
region, coloured red in the middle difference Ramachandran plot),
ILDN*’s helical population tends more to α-helix (note
the characteristic blue-coloured region in the difference Ramachandran
plot in the lower part of the helical region) and there is an oversampling
of the β-region by ILDN force field. This behaviour is replicated
if we repeat the calculation only for the stable structures of the
trajectory associated with low temperatures (data not shown). Furthermore,
it is transferred on a per residue level calculation (see Figure S5) and is particularly evident for the
central epitope residues 665KWAS668, which are
critical for antibody recognition. This implies that the calculated
secondary structure preferences cannot be an artifact of the end-effect
due to the peptide’s small size or of the insufficient simulation
length, as it is highly unlikely for both force fields to have not
sampled a stable peptide structure (Figure 5), but rather represent an inherent better
secondary structure balance of the ILDN* over the ILDN force field.

and ILDN* (right) force field, with yellow-red colours representing
high densities. The middle graph is the difference plot between the
two force fields where blue colors correspond to higher preferences
for ILDN* (right) and yellow-red colors correspond to higher preference
for ILDN (left) force field.

observed ones, for ILDN (black curve) and ILDN* (orange curve) force
fields as produced by the GoodTuring MD program (https://github.com/pkoukos/GoodTuringMD). The main curves are the estimates obtained using structures of
the whole trajectories whereas the curves in the inset are estimates
for only structures that are associated with temperatures of T < 340 K (corresponding to structurally more stable
peptide conformations).

To conclude, it seems that the two force fields agree on
the turn/coil
representation even on a per-residue level, but the ILDN* force field
is more α-helical whereas ILDN force field gives higher 310-helical content and emerges a minor yet unseen β-structure
population. This trend has been observed recently in folding simulations
using both helical and β-hairpin peptides.32,33 Surprisingly, the force fields’ agreement covers the end-residues
of the peptide that are quite flexible, leaving the central supposedly
structured part a point of controversy.

3 Conclusions
In this communication we tried to present the divergent structure
determinations for this debatable small peptide and unravel its structural
complexity by gathering the collection of representative available
structures. From our perspective, the view of Anglister’s group
of a 310-helix (PDB entry 1LCX(15)) holds only
partially true for this peptide, due to the imposition of a hydrogen
bond, which seems that is a necessary but not a sufficient condition
for the folding to a 310 type of helix. On the other hand,
Pessi’s group argued that this 310-helix might be
false and proposed instead that the peptide exists in solution as
a complex mixture of conformers (PDB entry 1MZI(18)), with some
local stable conformation for residues 660Leu, 663LD664, 666Trp and 670Trp. In particular,
they argued for a helical tendency for 659ELLEL663 residues followed by β-turn for 664DKW666 and coil for 667ASLWN671 residues. According
to our simulations, their ensemble of conformations (PDB entry 1MZI(18)) is not that often visited (10–20% of the low-temperature
associated frames and 3–6% of the total simulation time, Figures 2 and S1). However, the local conformations that they
proposed for certain residues are indeed supported by both our simulations
and from other experimental structures (Figures 2 and 3). This highlights
the difficulty in interpreting complex NMR data of disordered peptides
to build accurate models that can cover the entire peptide’s
landscape.

In a recent MD study, the peptide was found to have
significant
amount of helical population, though less in explicit solvent compared
to implicit solvent and visited the two experimental peptide structures
that were examined (PDB entries 1LCX(15) and 1TJH(34)) only upon end-to-end distance restrains.46 We believe that our unbiased molecular dynamics simulation
with the properly selected force field successfully managed to capture
the peptide’s heterogeneity and offered the plethora of accessible
peptide conformations with relative probabilities. Thus, our folding
simulations offer an invaluable method to tackle such a disordered
peptide that can accommodate different structures depending on the
sequence context, the interaction partner and the surrounding environment.

What’s more, the peptide’s structural variance allowed
us to compare the performance of two very closely related force field
versions, ILDN and ILDN*, and look for signs of discrepancy. Both
these refined force field versions reproduced all available experimental
structures in sub-angstrom accuracy while preserving the disordered
nature of the peptide. Nonetheless, the ILDN* force field offered
a better representation of all the structures by accommodating them
for a longer simulation time (although the actual simulation time
was 3 times less compared to the ILDN force field). Last but not least,
the backbone corrections in this modified ILDN* force field version
provided a better balance between the different secondary structural
elements with discrete differences in the helical region in the Ramachandran
plot: ILDN force field shows an overestimation of 310-helical
conformations wherein ILDN* force field favours α-helices instead.

Closing this section and based on this study, ILDN* force field
emerges out of the AMBER99SB-ILDN family, as the choice of preference.
The gp41[659–671] peptide through the availability of many
divergent structure determinations served as an excellent candidate
to examine the performance of molecular dynamics and current generation
force fields not only to reproduce all of them but also to indicate
structural preferences and nevertheless reveal sensitivities of the
force fields. We believe that current generation force fields have
matured enough in predicting peptide structure and dynamics that could
complement current experimental schemes that suffer from the weakness
of mixed folded/unfolded populations and the dependency on each experimental
condition and aim to a better interpretation of experiments.

4 Methods
4.1 Selection of Experimental
Structures
Figure 1 illustrates
the collection of experimental structures deposited in the PDB to
date, that comprise the complete 13-mer peptide sequence 659ELLELDKWASLWN671 as well as smaller 7-mer, 9-mer and 11-mer
peptide sequences that contain the complete central epitope sequence 662ELDKWA667. PDB entries that contain partially
the sequence of gp41[659–671] (like PDB entry 2X7R(47)), were not included for structural comparison with the
full 13-mer peptide sequence.

4.2 System
Preparation and Simulation Protocol
The starting peptide
structure, 659ELLELDKWASLWN671, was in the fully
extended form, as obtained from the program
Ribosome with both terminal ends unprotected. Addition of missing
hydrogen atoms and solvation–ionisation were performed with
the program LEAP from the AMBER tools distribution.48 The simulation was performed using periodic boundary conditions
and a cubic unit cell sufficiently large to guarantee a minimum separation
between the PBC-related images of the peptide of at least 16 Å,
filled with pre-equilibrated TIP3P water molecules.49 We followed the dynamics of the peptide’s folding
simulation using the program NAMD50 for
a grant total of 13 μs [10 μs with the AMBER99SB-ILDN,51 hereafter referred to as “ILDN”
and 3 μs with the AMBER99SB-STAR-ILDN52 force field, hereafter referred to as “ILDN*”] and
adaptive tempering with an inclusive temperature range of 280–480
K53 as implemented in the program NAMD
(adaptive tempering can be considered as a single-copy replica exchange
method with a continuous temperature range).

The simulation
protocol was the following: the system was first energy minimised
for 1000 conjugate gradient steps. Then the temperature was increased
with a ΔT step of 20 K until a final temperature
of 300 K over a period of 32 ps. Subsequently the systems were equilibrated
for 10 ps under NpT conditions without any restrains
until the volume equilibrated. This was followed by the production NpT runs with the temperature and the pressure controlled
using the Nosè–Hoover Langevin dynamics and Langevin
piston barostat control methods as implemented by the NAMD program,
with adaptive tempering applied through the Langevin thermostat, while
the pressure was maintained at 1 atm. The Langevin damping coefficient
was set to 1 ps–1 and the pistons oscillation period
to 200 fs, with a decay time of 100 fs. The production run was performed
with the impulse Verlet-I multiple timestep integration algorithm54 as implemented by NAMD. The inner time step
was 2 fs, with non-bonded interactions calculated every 1 time steps
and full electrostatics every 2 time steps using the particle mesh
Ewald method55 with a grid spacing of approximately
1 Å and a tolerance of 10–6. A cutoff for the
van der Waals interactions was applied through a switching function,
acting between 7 and 9 Å. The SHAKE algorithm56 with a tolerance of 10–8 was used to
restrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Trajectories were obtained
by saving the atomic coordinates of the whole system every 0.8 ps.

4.3 Extend of Sampling and Convergence
Given
the highly dynamic nature of the gp41[659–671] peptide
in solution, even 13 μs of cumulative folding simulation time
might be insufficient to characterise its folding landscape, especially
the vast configurational space of the disordered/unfolded conformations.
This can be nicely illustrated in Figure 5, where we demonstrate the application of
a recently proposed probabilistic method that applies Good–Turing
statistics to molecular dynamics trajectories.57 According to that, there is a small probability (1 out
of 10) to find structures that differ by more than 4 Å rmsd from
the ones already observed, if you account for the whole trajectory
and all-heavy atoms. This value drops down to 2.6–2.8 Å
if you consider the central peptide epitope sequence 662ELDKWA667 or the backbone atoms of the 13mer peptide (data
not shown). However for the
stable peptide conformations (T < 340 K), it seems
improbable to find structures with statistically significant difference
as there is a probability 1 out of 1000 to observe a structure with
rmsd > 0.5 Å from the ones already observed (inset in Figure 5, 13mer, all-heavy
atoms). This demonstrates the fine sampling of the stable peptide
conformations, offering statistical significance to our observations
regarding the experimentally observed structures (Figure 1 and Table S1). As for the unfolded fraction for which convergence is
difficult to achieve, parameters that are affected by this shortcoming
are explicitly discussed in the corresponding sections.

4.4 Trajectory Analysis
The programs
CARMA58 and GRCARMA59 together with custom scripts were used for most of the
analyses, including removal of overall rotations/translations, calculation
of the evolution of the Cα distances, calculation of rmsd’s
from a chosen reference structure, calculation of frame-to-frame rmsd
matrices, principal component analysis in both Cartesian60,61 and dihedral space62,63 and corresponding cluster analysis,
calculation of phi/psi dihedral angles, calculation of average structures
and of the atomic root mean square fluctuations and production of
PDB files from the trajectories. Secondary structure assignments were
calculated with the program STRIDE.64 All
molecular graphics work and figure preparation was performed with
the programs VMD65 and CARMA.58
