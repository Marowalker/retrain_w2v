A novel plant-based
dual-cure coating system based on a Michael
addition reaction between bismaleimide (BDM) and modified acetoacetylated
castor oil was developed. The BDM has a high reactivity toward acetylacetate
groups, and the catalyst 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (TEDA) was optimized by the rheological
viscosity. The gel was characterized by Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy. Then, three films were prepared with the TEDA
catalyst and analyzed with solid-state 13C NMR and FTIR
spectroscopy. The thermal and mechanical properties of the three films
were characterized by differential mechanical analysis, thermogravimetric
analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. We found that the
cross-linking density, glass transition temperature (Tg), and Young’s modulus of the
coating films increased with an increase in the ratio of acetylacetate
groups from the modified acetoacetylated castor oil. This is the first
study of the reaction of BDM with plant-based acetylacetate groups.
Importantly, a quantitative ratio of acetylacetate groups can be obtained
by a thiol–ene coupling reaction and a transesterification
reaction, resulting in the formation of films having excellent performance.

Introduction
Currently,
paint is present in many aspects of our lives, and it
can be said that where materials are used, there is paint. With the
increase in oil prices and the presence of global warming or the other
environmental problems, the development of resins from renewable resources
that can be replaced by petroleum-based coatings has become a priority.1−5 Vegetable oil is a promising renewable resource to prepare new coating
systems because it has a unique chemical structure with ester groups
and unsaturated sites, and this unique structure produces low-molecular-weight
polymeric materials with versatile applications.6−8

It is
an important method for preparing coating films by a Michael
addition reaction, which has been used in ships, aircraft, and other
fields.9 To date, the use of petrochemicals
as the raw coating materials with this method has been reported in
many papers,10,11 but a few articles report the use of raw coating materials
from renewable resources. In 2002, the Trumbo group12 found a novel Michael addition reaction between acetoacetylated
castor oil and multifunctional alamine for a curable coating film.
These films had different properties, but the maximum pencil hardness
of the coating film was HB. In 2012, the Webster group13 invented the Michael addition reaction based
on acetoacetylated sucrose to produce a high-performance coating,
but the acetoacetylated sucrose was obtained directly by a transesterification
reaction. Recently, our group14 reported
a novel Michael addition reaction between multifunctional acrylate
and acetoacetylated castor oil, but these coatings have poor mechanical
properties.

Bismaleimide (BDM) resins are high-performance thermosetting
polymers
that have great promise in applications such as in elastomers, printed
circuit boards, structural laminates, and aerospace.15−17 The advantages of bismaleimide resins include mechanical stability,
excellent processability, and thermal properties.18 For commercial purposes, bismaleimide resins are usually
used for curing with petroleum-based co-monomers such as polyesters,
epoxies, and polyimides.19,20 However, to the best
of our knowledge, it has not been reported that bismaleimides react
with plant-based acetylacetate groups.

Because the thiol–ene
coupling reaction has many advantages,
such as simplicity, rapidity, and high yield, its use to modify the
vegetable oils (or derivatives) is becoming a very promising research
topic.21−25 In this work, we show a novel dual-cure coating film between bismaleimide
(BDM) and acetoacetylated castor oil. The different ratios of the
acetylacetate groups from the castor oil were determined by a thiol–ene
coupling reaction and a transesterification reaction. The primary
novelties for this paper include (1) expanding the BDM structure based
on a Michael addition reaction into plant-based coating films, (2)
obtaining a quantitative ratio of acetylacetate groups by a thiol–ene
reaction and a transesterification reaction, and (3) demonstrating
that this method has a very wide application value for renewable plant
oils because vegetable oils contain many unsaturated C=C bonds.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of the Gel Time
In the initial study,
we used the rheological properties to study the gel time of acetoacetylated
castor oil and BDM in different catalysts [1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(TEDA), triethylamine (TEA), or piperidine]. At the gel point, the
loss modulus value (G″) is equal to the storage
modulus value (G′) and the viscosity (η)
also increases dramatically.26−28 As shown in Figure 1, compared with the TEA and piperidine
catalysts, the TEDA catalyst has the fastest gel time. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used to confirm the gel in Figure 2. The characteristic
peak at 3098 cm–1 is assigned to the C–H
stretching vibrations of BDM, and it is weakened significantly for
the spectra from the gel. Moreover, the −C=C–
stretching in the gel at 1584 cm–1 disappears, and
the C–N–C asymmetry stretching vibration at 1389 cm–1 is found in all spectra.29

Characterization of Film
After studying the catalysts
by rheological testing, we prepared a coating using the optimum cross-linking
time. According to the abovementioned cross-linking system, we prepared
film P1 and found that this film has a low pencil hardness. The possible
reason is that the cross-linking density of the system is low. To
improve the performance of the system, we increased the ratio of acetylacetate
groups from the castor oil (for details, see the sections Preparation of Modified Castor Oil and Preparation of Modified Acetoacetylated Castor Oil), thus increasing the cross-linking
density. As shown in Table 1, as the proportion of modified acetoacetylated castor oil
increases, the pencil hardness of the system gradually increases,
the curing time and acetone swelling decrease, and the gel rate and
gloss are similar.

Table 1 Properties of the Three Sample Films

P1	H	140	91	91	86	
P2	3H	80	93	78	89	
P3	4H	45	93	35	87	
These films (P1–P3) were first characterized
by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. As shown in Figure 3a, the characteristic
peaks of C–H stretching vibrations at 3098 cm–1 and stretching vibrations of C=C at 1584 cm–1 disappear and the C–N–C asymmetry stretching vibrations
at 1389 cm–1 are found in the spectra of all films.30,31 The results reveal that these films were connected with the bismaleimides.
A solid-state 13C NMR spectrum was also used to characterize
these films (in Figure 3b). The three films have similar chemical shift type of carbon signals at 202, 177, 168, 141, 129,
41, 30, and 18 ppm. The broad peaks at 18 and 30 ppm are attributed
to the overlap of the peaks from the alkyl group. The peak at 43 ppm
is attributed to the overlap of methyne peaks. The other peaks at 129, 141, 177, and 202 ppm can
be assigned to the no substituted aromatic carbon, the imide carbon, the substituted
aromatic carbon, and the carbon group in the acetoacetate, respectively.
Similar results were reported by the Li group.32,33 These FTIR and solid-state 13C NMR results confirm the
successful Michael addition reaction between the modified acetoacetylated
castor oil and the bismaleimides.

and modified acetoacetylated
castor oil. (b) Solid-state 13C NMR spectra of the three
films.

The storage modulus and loss factor
(tan δ) as a function
of the temperature of the three polymer films (P1–P3) are shown
in Figure 4. As the
temperature increased, the storage modulus exhibited (E′) a sharp drop, and it was followed by a modulus balance
at higher temperatures. The loss factor (tan δ) curves
for the three films are shown in Figure 4b. A peak maximum is observed in loss factor
(tan δ) curves, which is taken as the glass transition
temperature (Tg) for the three films.
The cross-linking density (ve) was calculated by
the following equation: ve = E′/3RT, where R is the universal gas constant, E′ is the storage modulus of the thermoset polymer
in the rubbery plateau region at Tg +
50 °C, and T is the absolute temperature. The
equation was reported by the Raju group,34 Soucek group,35 and Gu group.36 The storage modulus, Tg, and cross-linking density of the three films (P1–P3)
are shown in Table 2.

The stress–strain
curves of the three films (P1–P3)
are shown in Figure 5. From the three films, it can be seen that as the cross-linking
density increases, the mechanical properties gradually increase, which
increases the tensile strength from 3.46 to 7.68 MPa (Table 2). From Young’s modulus
in Table 2 (P1 = 0.2057
± 0.0070, P2 = 0.6331 ± 0.0215, and P3 = 1.0642 ± 0.0390),
it is obvious that the mechanical properties of the films based on
modified acetoacetylated castor oil improved.

curves of the three films based on BDM with
modified acetoacetylated castor oil.

Figure 6 shows
the
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves (and their derivative curves)
of the three films (P1–P3). All three films show a two-stage
degradation process. In the range of 160–330 °C, first-stage degradation takes place,
which is mainly due to the cleavage of unstable ester groups and sulfur–carbon
bonds.37 In the range of 330–480
°C, second-stage degradation takes place, which is related to
the corresponding polymer skeleton.38 The
loss derivative temperatures at a loss of 10 and 50 wt % mass and
maximum mass are summarized in Table 3. The main differences in the thermal degradation profiles
of these three samples are in the first stage, which is related to
the corresponding
thermal stability of sulfur–carbon bonds.

Conclusions
We demonstrated a novel
plant-based dual-cure coating film based
on a Michael addition reaction between bismaleimide (BDM) and modified
acetoacetylated castor oil. The catalyst (TEDA) was optimized by the
rheological viscosity and characterized by Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy. Three films were prepared using the TEDA catalyst
based on modified acetoacetylated castor oil obtained via a thiol–ene
coupling reaction and a transesterification reaction. These films
were characterized by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy
and FTIR, and the mechanical and thermal properties were characterized
by differential mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), and TGA. The results show that with the increased ratio of
acetylacetate groups from the modified acetoacetylated castor oil,
Young’s modulus, cross-linking density, and Tg of the coating films increased. This coating system
enabled a room temperature (25 °C) method and improved the performance
of the coating film by a thiol–ene coupling reaction, thus
increasing its range of application. Because vegetable oils contain
many unsaturated C=C bonds, this method has a very wide application
value in renewable plant oils.

Characterization of Coatings
The FTIR spectra were
obtained using a Bruker-Veretex70 spectrometer, and averages of 32
scans of each simple (P1–P3) ranging from 4000 to 500 cm–1 were determined. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
was performed on a GPC apparatus (Waters 515, Waters) at 25 °C.
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were collected
using a Bruker AV-400 NMR instrument, and the deuterated chloroform
was used as the solvent. The solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy was performed using a WB 600 MHz Bruker Avance
III spectrometer, and the measurement was made with a 4 mm magic-angle
spinning probe spinning at 12 kHz. Differential scanning calorimetry
was performed on a TA calorimeter (Q800, TA) with a heating rate of
10 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The viscosity was determined
using a TA Discovery HR-2 rheometer. Pencil hardness testing was performed
by the ASTM D 3363 protocol. DMA tensile testing was performed using TA
Instruments Q800 (New Castle, DE). Acetone swelling was calculated
by the following equation: M (%) = [(W1 – W2)/W2] × 100%, with a film with a known weight (W1) in an
acetone bath and the towel-dried sample weight (W2). The gel content was calculated by the following equation: M (%) = W2/W1 × 100%, with a film (2 cm × 2 cm pieces) with
a known weight (W1), and the dried film
was dipped in acetone for 48 h and dehydrated for 48 h at 60 °C
to provide a weight of W2.
