Cadmium sulfide (CdS) used in dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs)
is currently mainly synthesized by chemical bath deposition, vacuum
evaporation, spray deposition, chemical vapor deposition, electrochemical
deposition, sol–gel, solvothermal, radio frequency sputtering,
and hydrothermal process. In this paper, CdS was synthesized by hydrothermal
process and used with a mixture of titanium dioxide anatase and rutile
(TiO2(A+R)) to build the photoanode, whereas the counter
electrode was made of nanocomposites of conductive polymer polyaniline
(PANI) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) deposited on a fluorine-doped
tin oxide substrate. Two morphologies of CdS have been obtained by
using hydrothermal process: branched nanorods (CdSBR) and
straight nanorods (CdSNR). The present work indicates that
controlling the morphology of CdS is crucial to enhance the efficiency
of DSSCs device. Indeed, the higher power conversion energy of 1.71%
was achieved for a cell CdSBR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWCNTs under 100 mW/cm2, whereas the power
conversion energy of 0.97 and 0.83% for CdSNR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWCNTs and TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWCNTs,
respectively. Therefore, by increasing the surface to volume ratio
of CdS nanostructures and the crystallite size into those structures
opens the way to low-cost chemical production of solar cells.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar
cell (DSSC) has been extensively studied
and appears as a powerful substitute to other thin-film solar cells,
like silicon solar cells, largely because of the low cost of the materials
used and its relatively simple fabrication process. In DSSCs, light
absorption and charge-carrier transport occur in different steps (dissimilar
to what happen in solar cells using inorganic p–n junctions).1−9 DSSCs comprise three key parts: a transparent conducting oxide dispersed
on glass, a layer of mesoporous metal oxide semiconductor that is
photosensitized by a monolayer of dye molecules fixed onto the oxide
surface, and a counter electrode, which is most frequently a platinum-coated
fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The cell is filled by an
electrolyte to ensure hole transport and close the circuit.10,11

By incorporating a photoanode made of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures using ruthenium-dye sensitizers, certain
DSSCs demonstrated a power conversion efficiency greater than 12.5%.12 Currently, DSSCs based on zinc oxide (ZnO) continue
to show low efficiency numbers, compared to TiO2-based
DSSCs. The photocatalytic features of TiO2 are dependent
on its crystalline phase, its pore structure, its specific surface
area, and its crystallite size. TiO2 occurs in three crystalline
phases: rutile (the thermodynamic stable phase), anatase and brookite
(the two metastable phases). Numerous studies have established the
anatase phase of TiO2 as a highly effective photocatalytic
material for multiple uses.13 It is still
poorly understood why the anatase phase exhibits higher photocatalytic
activity than rutile phase. TiO2 acts as a catalyst in
the ultraviolet region because of its wide band gap (∼3.2 eV)
and this restricts its ability to harvest light. To overcome this
drawback, sensitized composites of two or more semiconducting materials
with offset band gaps and positions are used (Bi2S3, CuInS2, CdTe, CdS, CdSe, PbS are examples). These
semiconductors capture light in the visible region and function as
useful sensitizers due to their capacity to transfer electrons to
larger band gap semiconductors, including TiO2.14 Cadmium sulfide (CdS) recently became a promising
alternative material because of its 2.3 eV direct band gap absorbing
into the visible region of the spectrum.15−18

A huge effort has been
focused on controlling the shape and size
of CdS nanocrystals. As a result, several new methods have been published
for synthesizing CdS nanostructures, especially CdS nanowires.19 Inducing the formation of branches on existing
nanowires or nanorods results in enlarged surface areas that can boost
charge-transportation channels and increase light absorption. These
techniques may have significant industrial applications in optoelectronics.20

Numerous chemical and physical techniques
have been employed, such
as colloidal, solvothermal, vapor deposition, template, and laser
ablation methods, to synthesize CdS micro/nanostructures.21 Yao et al. and Peng et al.  synthesized
CdS nanowires by using laser ablation of a metal catalyst mixed target
and CdS.22,23 Solution deposition protocols, with or without
organic surfactants, chemical vapor deposition, and high-temperature
thermal decomposition methods, were used to synthesize one-dimensional
CdS nanostructures. These structures include nanobelts,22,24 nanowires,22,25 nanorods,22,26 and nanotubes.20,22,27 Chen et al. have developed a simple one-step, no template hydrothermal
technique for fabricating CdS nanorod arrays on an indium tin oxide
substrate.20,28 Hydrothermal process was defined
by Byrappa and Yoshimura (2008) as any homogeneous (nanoparticles)
or heterogeneous (bulk materials) reaction occurring at high temperature
and pressure larger than 1 atm.29 Hydrothermal
fabrication has numerous benefits compared to other conventional processes.
The technique can produce homogeneous and pure-phase materials, as
well as speeding up reaction rates by improving solid and fluid species
interactions. Indeed, hydrothermal fluids have lower viscosity, higher
diffusion rates, which consequently enable efficient mass transport.
There are a number of practical and environmental benefits to this
process: pollution free (reactions are completed within a closed system),
low process temperatures (possible within a suitable solvent), overall
low energy consumption, better dispersion, better shape regulation,
improved control of nucleation, simplicity of the technique, and cost
effectiveness.29 Hossain et al. presented
CdS deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD) on TiO2 to fabricate DSSCs, and the conversion efficiency was 1.13%.30 Abdulelah et al. reported an improvement
in the conversion efficiency of DSSCs  (∼1.25%) by
producing porous CdS via CBD.31 The incorporation
of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polyaniline (PANI) enhances the DSSC
performance. Benetti et al. were the first to fabricate CNTs–polymer
composites by mixing epoxy resin with multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs).10 Since then, many studies have
studied various configurations and formulations of CNTs–polymer
composites. PANI is extremely stable in air. In addition, its physical
properties and electronic structure display extensive changes when
in a protonated form. These properties make PANI an exceptionally
useful contender for numerous applications.32−34 Conductive
PANI-packed nanotubes might produce innovative materials with very
useful optical, electronic, or thermal characteristics.32,35

In this study, TiO2(A+R) were deposited by spray-coating
onto CdS nanorods, which were prepared by hydrothermal deposition
technique on top of a commercial FTO transparent conductive glass.
Branched cadmium sulfide (CdSBR) or straight cadmium sulfide
nanorods (CdSNR) with TiO2(A+R) were used as
a photoelectrode in DSSCs, whereas PANI–MWCNTs nanocomposites
were used as a counter electrode. The DSSC fabrication and characterization
are described in Sections 2 and 3, respectively.

oxide
anatase TiO2 99.7% were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Iodine I2 was purchased from Mallinckodi chemical work.
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate, with a resistivity
of 12–17 Ω cm, was purchased from Nanocs. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone (C3H6O), cadmium nitrate Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium iodide (KI), and ethanol
(C2H6O) were purchased from Fisher Scientific.
Aniline C6H7N ≥ 99% and sulfuric acid
H2SO4 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All of
the chemicals were used without any further purification.

2.2 Fabrication of the Photoanode
FTO-coated
glass with dimensions of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 was used as
substrate. Prior to the deposition, the substrate was cleaned ultrasonically
within acetone, methanol, and deionized water (DI water, 18.20 MΩ
cm) for 5 min each. CdSNR and CdSBR were synthesized
to fabricate the photoanode of the DSSC. Initially, CdSNR was synthesized by using an hydrothermal process,20 specifically an aqueous solution with thiourea, cadmium
nitrate, and glutathione was prepared according to the following molar
ratio (1:1:0.6) and stirred for a few minutes. Then, the solution
was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (20
cm3 capacity). Finally, the FTO substrate was placed into
the autoclave and then loaded into the oven at 200 °C for 3.5
h. The sample was rinsed with DI water after being cooled down naturally
to room temperature. Then, the sample was naturally dried in air at
room temperature.

To functionalize CdSBR, the resultant
CdSNR was rinsed in dilute HCl with a ratio (1:9) for 30
s and then cleaned with DI water. The product was then placed into
a fresh solution, and the hydrothermal approach was repeated for 3.45
h at 200 °C to get the branched CdS structure (CdSBR). A mass of 3 g from each titanium dioxide phase (anatase and rutile,
TiO2(A+R)) was mixed with acetic acid and DI water (10:90%)
to create a suspension. After stirring it for nearly 35 min, the suspension
was deposited by spray deposition onto CdSBR and CdSNR. The deposition occurred on a hot plate at 180 °C to
produce a porous layer of TiO2(A+R) nanoparticles on FTO/CdSBR and FTO/CdSNR. The photoanode was then annealed
in an oven at 450 °C for 1 h. Finally, the FTO/CdSBR–TiO2(A+R) and FTO/CdSNR–TiO2(A+R) photoanodes were sensitized under dark conditions using
an ethanol solution containing the N719 dye (0.01 g of N719 in 20
mL of ethanol) for 24 h.

2.3 Fabrication of the Counter
Electrode
PANI was synthesized by electrochemical polymerization.34,36 Specifically, aniline monomer (2 M) was dissolved into sulfuric
acid (1 M), and the solution was stirred for a few minutes until a
clear solution was obtained. The polymerization process of aniline
was performed on a clean FTO substrate at room temperature for 3 min
at 2 V, then the dark green produced electrode was rinsed with DI
water to remove the remaining aniline. MWCNTs were deposited on PANI
to improve the electrical conductivity and chemical stability of PANI.
The purified MWCNTs were initially dispersed into DMF (0.3 g/mL) and
sonicated for 3 h.36 The resultant suspension
is then simultaneously deposited by spray deposition onto FTO/PANI.
The deposition occurred at 130 °C on a hot plate. A liquid electrolyte
containing the I3–/I– redox couple
(RE) of potassium iodide (0.83 g) and iodine (0.127 g) was dissolved
into 10 mL of ethylene glycol. The electrolyte was then added between
the photoanode and the counter electrode (FTO PANI–MWCNTs).
The experimental steps are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 General procedure used to build the DSSCs structure.

2.4 Solar
Cell Fabrication
The DSSC consists
of FTO/CdSBR or FTO/CdSNR as photoelectrode,
whereas FTO/PANI–MWCNTs was the counter electrode. The dimensions
of the DSSC are 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 for the outer area and
0.9 × 0.9 cm2 the inner area, which is filled with
the electrolyte. The schematic diagram of FTO/CdSBR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT/FTO device is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of
FTO/CdSBR/PANI–MWNT/FTO
device.

The photoelectrode (anode) of
the DSSC was made of CdSNR or CdSBR covered
by a thin layer of nonporous TiO2(A+R) used on top of a
conducting substrate (FTO). PANI coated
by MWNTs was used as the counter electrode (cathode). The high surface
area of CdS nanorods with nonporous TiO2(A+R) enable FTO/CdS–TiO2(A+R) to adsorb dye molecules (N719). Iodide electrolyte containing
I–/I3– redox filled
the space between the dye-sensitized n-type (CdS with nonporous TiO2(A+R)) and p-type (PANI–MWNTs). When the DSSC was exposed
to light, the photoexcitation occurred in the dye molecules, then
the electron transferred from the highest occupied molecular orbital
to the lowest molecular orbital states, as illustrated in Figure 3. An electron transfers
to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2(A+R) results by the
oxidation of the dye molecules, which consequently transfers the electron
into the CB of CdS. The oxidized dye molecules were regenerated by
electrons coming from the reduced state of the redox couple (RE),
which consequently oxidized to I3– (OX).
Finally, the I3– was regenerated by accepting
electron from the counter electrode.

3 Characterization
The morphology and
the structure of the CdS nanorods were observed
within a scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM7000F with energy dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDS). The crystallinity of the products was studied
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and carried out on a Rigaku Miniflex 600
X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a 1.54056 Å
wavelength. Raman spectroscopy was also used to characterize the CdSBR and CdSNR. Optical absorption of the samples
and substrate were recorded by acquiring the spectra with a UV–vis
spectrometer from 300 to 900 nm. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were evaluated and measured
using a Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark and under illumination
at AM 1.5. The solar light simulator had an intensity of 100 mW/cm2.

4 Results and Discussion
The CdS nanorods
(CdSNR) and branched nanorods (CdSBR) have been
characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Figure 4). CdSNR and CdSBR were grown by using a hydrothermal
process to cover uniformly the FTO substrate. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the dimensions
of the vertically ordered CdSNR are ∼100 nm in diameter,
∼230 nm in length, which are consistent with the dimensions
reported by Chen et al.37 The hexagonal
cross-section of the CdSNR was clearly observed in Figure 4a. Furthermore, the
EDS analysis exhibited the presence of Cd and S elements with a ratio
∼1:1, whereas the compositions for Cd and S in the compound
are 48.55 and 51.45%, respectively, as shown in Figure 4e,f. EDS analysis of the CdSBR revealed that the composition of Cd = 51.09% and S = 48.91%. Figure 4c,d shows the CdSBR morphology at low and high magnifications, which indicate
a uniform coverage of CdSBR onto the surface of the FTO
substrate. CdSBR consists of straight CdSNR backbones
with length of ∼250 nm and hexagonal branches dimensions of
∼200 nm length and ∼100 nm diameter. As expected, the
reaction time for hydrothermal process has an effect on the dimensions
of CdSNR and CdSBR. The presence of thin branches
along the CdSNR backbones, which form the CdSBR structure, improves the performance of DSSCs due to a decrease in
recombination.

The fractal geometry characterizes
the scaling structure of a surface
by a number Dfractal called the fractal
dimension that varies between 2 (when the surface is flat) and 3.
Considering the growth of thin films, the surface contains lakes within
islands and islands within lakes, which we will refer to simply as
islands. When the islands are characterized by a surface with a fractal
dimension Dfractal, the coastlines formed
by the islands sectioning by a plane are with a dimension D′fractal = Dfractal – 1. The surface of the island A is linked
to its radius R by the relationship A ∝ R2. And the perimeter of the
island P is linked to the fractal dimension of the
thin-film D′fractal with the relation P ∝ RD′fractal. So, the relationship linking the perimeter with
the surface is a power law given by P = μAαfractal, where μ is
the proportionality factor between the perimeter and the surface,
αfractal = D′fractal/2.38,39 The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements
are carried out with a Bruker Dimension-Icon AFM (peak force) in tapping
mode (f = 300 kHz). The tip was a silicon AFM probe
Tap300 Al-G with a constant force of 40 N/m. AFM images are shown
in Figure 5. The fractal
dimension was extracted with the WSxM software.40 The measured fractal dimensions of straight and branched
CdS nanorods are 1.670 ± 0.049 and 1.705 ± 0.045, respectively.
Further analysis showed that the typical densities of CdSBR and CdSNR are ∼57 and ∼46 nanorods/μm2, respectively.

Figure 6a illustrates
the absorbance spectra from (300–900) nm of CdSNR, CdSBR, and FTO substrate. The CdSBR structure
absorbs mainly in the visible region ranging from 326 to 573 nm, whereas
the CdSNR structure absorbs in the region ranging from
320 to 520 nm. Since, both structures absorb mainly the violet and
blue wavelengths, the remaining transmitted light will exhibit the
complementary color to the wavelengths absorbed, i.e., yellow–orange.
Apparently, the absorbance peak for the CdSBR structure
is higher than that of CdSNR structure, which is attributed
to the high surface area covered by CdSBR compared to CdSNR, and thus absorbing and harvesting more photons. The band
gaps of CdSNR and CdSBR were established to
be 2.37 and 2.28 eV, respectively, as shown in Figure 6b, which indicates that the absorption edge
of CdSNR is identified to be at lower wavelength than that
of the CdSBR. On Figure 6c, the XRD patterns of as-prepared CdSNR, CdSBR, and FTO are presented. The hexagonal wurtzite
phase of CdS is confirmed and the intensity peak (002) at 2θ
= 24.6° referring the formation of the CdSBR grown
on FTO with better crystallization than CdSNR. The mean
crystallite sizes of CdSNR and CdSBR have been
determined by using the Debye–Scherrer’s equation, D = Kλ/β cos θ,
where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation in nanometer
(nm), D is the crystallite size, β is the full
width at the half-maximum of the peak, θ the diffraction angle,
and K is a constant, usually taken as 0.94.34,41−43 The measurements indicate that the mean crystallite
sizes were 42.97 ± 4.2 and 49.37 ± 1.5 nm for CdSNR, CdSBR, respectively. On Figure 6d, the Raman spectra of the as-prepared CdSNR and CdSBR are shown at room temperature. The
longitudinal optical phonon modes 1LO and 2LO of CdS were measured
at 297 cm–1 and at 600 cm–1 for
both structures. These values are in agreement with the literature.44−46 It can be clearly seen that there is no difference in the peak position
between the Raman spectra of CdSNR and CdSBR because the same growth technique was used. However, there is a
difference in the shape of the peak, which indicates a better crystalline
structure for CdSBR compared to CdSNR.34 This enhanced crystalline structure is confirmed
by XRD in Figure 6c.

The morphology of the CdSBR/TiO2(A+R) is
presented in Figure 7a, it is seen obviously that the surface of CdSBR was
perfectly attached to the TiO2(A+R) nanoparticles. Figure 7b displays the typical
SEM image tilted view at low and high magnifications of MWCNTs deposited
on FTO. The good coverage of nanotube network onto the FTO substrate
is visible in the Figure 7b, due to the dissolution of the MWCNTs in the DMF. Figure 7c shows the SEM image
of PANI network after polymerization onto the FTO substrate. Figure 7d demonstrates a
good interface between PANI–MWCNTs due to the diffusion of
MWCNTs between the porous PANI film.

The UV–vis light absorption
of rutile is more efficient
compared to anatase, however, the reflectivity of anatase is higher
than rutile in the UV–vis region.47 Therefore, a mixture of anatase and rutile provides better optical
properties for the photoanode. On Figure 8a, the UV–vis absorption spectra of
dye-sensitized CdSBR + TiO2(A+R), dye-sensitized
CdSNR + TiO2(A+R), TiO2(A+R), and
dye were recorded. It is noticed, as expected, that the absorbance
of sensitized CdSBR + TiO2(A+R) is higher than
CdSNR + TiO2(A+R) in the 450–500 and
575–675 nm regions due to increasing the surface area of CdSBR + TiO2(A+R) in comparison to CdSNR + TiO2(A+R). Although the absorption peak of TiO2(A+R) shows up near 540 and 700 nm, it shows that the presence
of CdS enhances light absorption edge in the visible light regions
at around 400–540 and 550–700 nm by harvesting more
photons.48Figure 8a shows a typical XRD patterns of TiO2(A+R) before and after annealing. The largest intensity of
XRD peaks of TiO2(A+R) after annealing as compared to product
before annealing indicates a better crystallization due to the removal
of DI water from the nanoparticles.

The current density versus
voltage (J–V curves) of the
DSSCs are shown at room temperature under
illumination and dark conditions in Figure 9a,b respectively. The device parameters for
each DSSC, i.e., the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), current
short circuit (JSC), open-circuit voltage
(VOC), fill factor (FF), shunt resistance
(Rsh), and series resistance (Rs) are enlisted in Table 1.

Table 1 Photovoltaic Parameters
of DSSCs Devices
devices	JSC (mA/cm2)	VOC (V)	FF (%)	Rsh (Ω cm2)	Rs (Ω cm2)	PCE (%)	
CdSBR/TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWCNTs	12.16	0.46	30	5.09	2.09	1.71	
CdSNR/TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWCNTs	6.73	0.42	34	8.84	3.42	0.97	
TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWCNTs	6.87	0.41	29	7.25	3.84	0.83	
Among all of the DSSCs devices, CdSBR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT shows a significantly
higher PCE (1.71%)
than CdSNR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT
(0.98%) and TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT (0.83%). The incorporation
of CdSBR into TiO2(A+R) as photoanode improves
the charge transport and reduces the recombination of charges due
to the larger surface area, which results in a continuous path for
electrons and more dye-binding sites. Moreover, the branched structure
of CdS (CdSBR) absorbs more light than the straight structure
of CdS (CdSNR), which consequently exhibits strong higher
power conversion efficiency.49 Thus, it
is reasonable to say that the PCE is enhanced by the morphology of
CdSBR due to larger crystallite size for CdSBR49 37 ± 1.5 nm in comparison to CdSNR 42.97 ± 4.2 nm, meaning less grain boundaries, which
consequently increase the electrical conductivity, and therefore the
efficiency of solar cell is improved.

The performance of the
displayed CdSBR in DSSCs could
be compared with previous studies based on CdS prepared by CBD. Table 2 shows highest power
conversion efficiency for the presented work, which in terms refers
that the current design of CdS synthesized via hydrothermal process
is very effective for enhancing the performance of DSSCs.

FF module depends on both Rsh and Rs. The series resistances Rs (should be low) under illumination for CdSBR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT, CdSNR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT, and TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT
were 2.09, 3.42, and 3.84 Ω cm2, respectively. This
means that the lowest Rs based on the
cell containing CdSBR gives the largest current, Isc = 12.16 mA, and high Rs reduces FF of the module and Isc. Although shunt resistance (should be high) is one of the factors
that effects Voc, low shunt resistance
resulting from cracks, pin holes, or impurities in and near the junction
leads to an increasing shunt current, and then low Rsh decreases both of Pmax and
FF of the module,51,52 and hence the performance of
the DSSCs, as shown in Table 1. Another reason to explain the high efficiency of CdSBR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWNT is  the
large surface area of TiO2(A+R) nanoparticles. It should
be mentioned that if CdS is deposited on top of TiO2 then the PCE will be higher than having TiO2 deposited on top of CdS, due to the difference between conduction
bands of CdS and TiO2. However, this situation actually
depends on the nature of deposition, since the CdS deposited here
is produced via hydrothermal process, the growth should be performed
on the top of the conduction substrate and cannot be on top of TiO2. The PCE (η) of DSSCs was calculated by the equation
η = FF × JSC × VOC/Pin where FF
is the fill factor, JSC the short-circuit
current, VOC is the open-circuit voltage,
and Pin is the power of incident light.
The fill factor (FF) was calculated by equation FF = JmVm/JSCVOC where Jm is the current density at the maximum power point and Vm is the voltage at the maximum power point.2,34,53,54

5 Conclusions
In this paper, the effect of
CdS nanorods on the performance of
DSSCs has been studied. The low cost and simple solution deposition
technique work reliably for high performance of DSSCs. CdSNR and CdSBR produced via hydrothermal technology and two-step
hydrothermal process, respectively, allowed  higher absorbance
in the visible region, larger crystallite size, better junctions,
and uniform morphology. To design DSSCs devices, three cells
were fabricated with one hybrid counter electrode PANI–MWCNTs,
and the most efficient device was CdSBR–TiO2(A+R)/PANI–MWCNTs due to the high surface area of the hybrid
working electrode compared to CdSNR–TiO2(A+R) and TiO2(A+R) devices. Therefore,
CdSBR  morphology is an interesting nanostructure
to improve the efficiency of  DSSCs.
