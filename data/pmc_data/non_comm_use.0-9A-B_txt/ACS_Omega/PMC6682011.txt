Stabilization of polymer nanocomposites
in aqueous environment with high salinity has been a constant challenge
for their applications. This work aimed to improve the stability of
graphene oxide (GO) polyacrylamide nanocomposites at high-temperature
and high-ionic-strength brines. GO was synthesized via a modified
Hummers’ method and the copolymer of acrylamide (COPAM) was
obtained via free-radical polymerization. The covalent functionalization
of COPAM with the partially reduced GO (rGO) was successfully achieved.
1,3-Propane sultone was used to further functionalize the obtained
rGO–COPAM composites to accomplish the zwitterionic character
on the rGO–COPAM surface to get a material with excellent temperature
stability and dispersibility in the presence of high ionic strength
brines. The synthesized materials were characterized by 1H NMR, gel permeation chromatography, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy analysis,
and so forth. The thermal stability of the dispersion at 80 °C
for 120 days was observed by visual inspection and spectroscopic analysis.
The results showed that the zwitterionic polymer produced
excellent brine stability with GO nanosheets and suggested promising
applications of zwitterionic polyacrylamide–GO systems especially
for enhanced oil recovery.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polymer nanocomposite stabilization in aqueous
environment with extreme salinity (high ionic strength) has been considered
recently as a key subject in the research field. For instance, in
petroleum industries, nanomaterials have been recently proposed to
deliver into oil reservoirs acting as sensors or imaging enhancers
to provide useful information regarding the reservoir conditions.
However, delivering nanomaterials into a reservoir is a challenging
task because of the high salinity and high temperature of the environment,
which can easily destabilize the injected nanomaterials.

Several
approaches such as physical dispersion methods, covalent bonding,
and noncovalent bonding methods have been implemented to address this
stabilization issue. A composite of carbon nanoparticles and ionic
polymer (poly(vinyl alcohol)) was shown to be stable in American Petroleum
Institute brine (APIB). The polymer was grafted onto the nanoparticle
surface by acidic treatment using chlorosulfonic acid. It has been
reported that the nanoparticles that are partially sulfonated showed
better dispersion stability at 100 °C in APIB than highly sulfonated
nanoparticles, while unsulfonated nanoparticles were not dispersed.
The long-term temperature stability, however, was not examined, which
prevented their use as reservoir sensors.1 Vancso et al. also observed the stability of polyimidazole betaine
in 22.6 wt % NaCl solution without reporting the long-term thermal
stability.2 Johnston and co-workers3 attempted to stabilize nanocomposites containing
poly-acrylate-/acrylamide-type polymers and iron oxide nanoparticles
wrapped with sulfonic salt in reservoir conditions with APIB for the
duration of 1 month at 90 °C. The finding showed that the stabilization
was favored by the ionic nature of the polymer and nanoparticle repulsion
against agglomeration.

The copolymer of acrylamide (COPAM) is
a popular polymer that has extensive use in different areas including
oil and gas because of its excellent properties.4−11 Several investigations have been
conducted on the graphene oxide (GO)-based polyacrylamide composites;12−20 for example, in oil and gas exploitation and production, it was
primarily used as an additive in an advanced drilling fluid for fluid-loss
control.21 It has been reported that GO
improved the rheology and thermal stability of polyacrylamide under
a high temperature of up to 85 °C;22 this improvement is attributed to the presence of the large number
of the anionic group on the edge of the GO sheet, which contributes
to the electrostatic repulsion.21−24 However, despite the tremendous
use of polyacrylamide/GO nanocomposites, its stability in aqueous
solution with high ionic strength is a challenging issue because of
GO sheet aggregation and restacking, which is due to the strong intersheet
van der Waals forces.25,26 However, for EOR applications,
these nanocomposites are required to be stable under high-temperature
and high-salinity conditions. Our recent preliminary study showed
an unsuccessful dispersion stability in GO–COPAM solution at
ambient temperature and higher under the influence of both APIB and
formation brine (FB). This is probably due to the electrostatic cross-linking
between the GO sheets caused by divalent ions and consequently led
to destabilization of the solution.

Aiming to address the stability
challenges of GO/polyacrylamide nanocomposites in harsh conditions,
this work proposed a novel stabilization approach via surface modification
of the COPAM and reduced GO (rGO) using 1,3-propane sultone in order
to accomplish a zwitterionic character on the material surface. It
has been reported that zwitterion molecules possess outstanding solubility
and stability in the presence of brines because of their antipolyelectrolyte
effect.27,28 Addition of electrolyte materials results
in chain expansion and later promotes stabilization and de-agglomeration
via electrostatic chemistry (steric effects).29 Zwitterion molecules have been applied as antifouling coatings in
seawater30 and suggested to be used potentially
in enhanced oil recovery.31 Recently, the
zwitterionic rGO/poly(vinylimidazole)-co-poly(aminostyrene)
composite was reported to be stable at high temperature under the
influence of high-ionic-strength brines for over 90 days.28

Therefore, a successful GO–COPAM
composite was synthesized by covalently attaching the COPAM of acrylamide (AA) and 2-acrylamido-(3-acrylamdopropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (ATAC) monomers onto the partial rGO sheets. The resulting rGO–COPAM
composite was further exposed to post-functionalization chemistry
using 1,3-propane sultone to create zwitterion groups (species with
functional groups, of which at least one has a positive and one has
a negative electrical charge). This approach has an advantage including
chemical reactivity between the polymer and large surface area of
the GO basal plane,32,33 which further promote the functionalization
and ability of the adsorbed nanomaterials to be used in the area of
interest.34−37 The synthesized zwitterionic rGO–COPAM composites
were dispersed in APIB and FB, their long-term temperature stability
was monitored both spectroscopically and visually upon standing for
120 days at 80 °C. The dispersed zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
solution demonstrated excellent dispersion ability in both APIB and
FB.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Graphite
powder, acrylamide (AA, 99%), ATAC monomers, 4-4′-azo-bis-4-cyanopentanoic
acid (ACPA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 36%),
potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 99%), 1,3-propane sultone,
sodium nitrite, ascorbic acid, and all salt components were ordered
from Sigma-Aldrich, and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95%) and nitric acid (HNO3, 69%) were obtained from
VWR chemicals. No further purification was performed on the chemicals
before use.

2.2 Synthesis
of GO
Modified Hummers’ method was used to synthesize
stable GO nanosheets.38 Approximately 20
μm of graphite powder was used as the starting material. Nitric
and sulfuric acids were mixed in water and used for oxidation of graphite
solution. Graphite powder (12 g) was dissolved in a mixture of 50
mL of HNO3 and 100 mL of H2SO4 and
stirred at ambient condition for 24 h. Subsequently, distilled water
(100 mL) was added to the mixture followed by continuous stirring
for 24 h. KMnO4 (12 g) was gently included in the solution
and then stirred for another 5 h under ambient temperature. To keep
the temperature low, an ice back containing 60 mL of 36% H2O2 solution was added and stirred overnight. A Whatman
filter paper was used to extract the resulting suspension. The filtrate
was washed three times using 10% HCL after centrifugation for 1 h
at 13 000 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded.

2.3 Synthesis of COPAM
The
COPAM and ATAC were synthesized via free-radical polymerization.39,40 The polymerization was carried out in a three-neck bottom reactor,
equipped with a reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet gas, and a mechanical
stirrer as shown in Figure S1. Initially,
the reactor was charged with a dissolved mixture of AA and ATAC monomers
in 80 mL of degassed and distilled water. An oil bath was prepared,
and the reactor was placed inside. The solution was sprinkled under
inert atmosphere for 30 min while stirring. Water-soluble ACPA initiator
(10 mg) was added to the reactor to trigger the reaction. The mixture
undergoes 6 h of heating at 80 °C while string and then cooled
down at room temperature to obtain the clear and viscous product.
The solution was precipitated into acetone and allowed to dry overnight
under vacuo at 60 °C.

2.4 Synthesis (Preparation) of GO Polymer Composites
GO was dispersed in distilled water to obtain 1 mg/mL with up to
30 mL of total solution. In order to obtain partial rGO, 15.1 mg of l-ascorbic acid was included in the solution, followed by 1
h gentle stirring at 60 °C, and the solution was cooled down
and used immediately in the next stage. In a separate container, 3
mg/mL of COPAM was dissolved in 50 mL of water while stirring for
5 min under sonication and allowed to cool down. The cooled rGO dispersion
was then slowly added to the COPAM solution, followed by 30 min of
stirring. The mixture of rGO–COPAM was sonicated for 30 min,
followed by overnight stirring at 60 °C, and later reduced in
vacuo (concentrated). Subsequently, the solution was centrifuged for
15 min at 5000 rpm to induce flocculation after acetone was added.
The product was freeze-dried to obtain a solid rGO–COPAM composite.

2.5 Synthesis of Zwitterionic
Polymer Composites
The zwitterionic rGO–COPAM composites
were prepared by modification using 1,3 propane sultone following
the procedure published in the previous literature.28 The amount of 1,3 propane sultone was experimentally decided
after conducting many experiments to determine the effect of different
1,3 propane sultone concentrations in COPAM solubility and viscosity.
Different concentrations of 1, 3 propane sultone (0.05, 0.15, 0.25,
0.35, 0.45, and 0.55 wt %) were dispersed into the COPAM solution
followed by gentle stirring at room temperature and observed their
changes in solubility overnight; their viscosity was also subsequently
measured. However, both the solubility (Figure S2a) and viscosity (Figure S2b)
remain the same in all the concentrations. Therefore, the amount of
1,3 propane sultone was selected based on the previously published
procedure.28 rGO–COPAM was dispersed
in 100 mL of water under sonication at room temperature, followed
by the addition of 350.2 mg of 1,3-propane sultone.28 The above combination was then transferred into a three-neck
bottom flask and refluxed overnight under inert atmosphere. The mixture
undergoes 15 min centrifugation at a speed of 2500 rpm and then the
supernatant was decanted. The resulting solution was then cleaned
with methanol and distilled water (1:9). The obtained zwitterionic
rGO–COPAM composite was sealed and stored in a clean container
after removing methanol in vacuo.

2.6 Preparation of Brine Solutions
APIB was
obtained by dissolving 5.0 g of calcium chloride dihydrate and 20.0
g of sodium chloride in 225 mL of distilled water. FB was achieved
by dissolving 24.9 g of calcium chloride dehydrate, 37.3 g of sodium
chloride, 0.26 g of sodium bicarbonate, 0.3 g of sodium sulfate, 6.6
g of magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and 5 mg of barium chloride in
500 mL of distilled water. The percentages of individual salts are
shown in Table 1.

2.7 Stability of Zwitterionic
rGO–COPAM in Brine Solutions
First, 90 mL of the respective
brine solutions was added into each of the two separate capped containers
labeled APIB and FB containing 10 mL of zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
composite to obtain a 9:1 ratio. After sonicating the solutions for
5 min, it was then stored at 80 °C uninterrupted in an oven.
A portion of each sample was taken for characterization prior to the
storage and after 24 h (1 day) and then subsequently after the intervals
of 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. The photos of the extracted solutions
were taken on those days for comparison as shown in Figure 6.

2.8 Characterization
The proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) of the polymer was carried out on a JEOL-600
NMR spectrometer. Deuterium oxide (D2O) solvent was used
for field-frequency lock, and the observed proton chemical shifts
are reported in parts per million. The Agilent Technologies Infinity
gel permeation chromatography (1260 MDS, GPC) was applied for determining
the molecular weight of the polymer. NaNO3 (0.1 M) was
used as the mobile phase for the molecular weight and polydispersity
analysis. The samples were filtered by 0.22 μm pore size GVWP
hydrophilic membrane before injection. The functionality of the samples
was measured by attenuated total reflection (ATR)–Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR, Nicolet iS10). The data were recorded within the frequency
range of 4000–400 cm–1 at a spectral resolution
of 4 cm–1. The percentage of chemical composition
was determined on an elemental (CHNS–O) analyzer (CHNS–O
analyzer, Thermo Scientific FLASH 2000). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was also used to evaluate the elemental analysis for prepared
composites. The thermal stability was performed using a DSC-3/TGA/(Mettler
Toledo) stare system. It was operated under nitrogen gas
at 50 mL/min flow rate and heating range between 35 and 900 °C
with an interval of 10 °C/min. A scanning electron microscope
with high-performance cold-field emission (SU8230 Hitachi, Leeds Electron
Microscopy and Spectroscopy Centre, UK) operated at 2 kV and a transmission
electron microscope operated at 300 (FEI Titan Themis Cubed 300, Leeds
Electron Microscopy and Spectroscopy Centre, UK) were used to observe
the surface morphology. An energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
(Oxford INCA 350) attached to the scanning electron microscope was
used to identify the elemental compositions and location of the element.
The sedimentation behavior of both GO–COPAM and zwitterionic
rGO–COPAM composites was evaluated after the initial preparation
stage in APIB and FB using Turbiscan, a vertical scan analyzer (MA
2000, Toulouse, France), using the procedure reported in the literature.41 The percent transmittance (% T) spectra of zwitterionic rGO–COPAM solution in both APIB
and FB samples were recorded using Varian Cary 6000i UV–vis
spectroscopy in quartz cuvettes. The zeta potential together with
the particle size distribution was measured by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) technique using a Malvern Nanosizer. The dispersion stability
of zwitterionic rGO–COPAM composite was observed to investigate
the sedimentation and flocculation behavior by measuring the transmission
of near-infrared light under the influence of centrifugal force using
(LUMiSizer, Lum GmbH, Germany) a dispersion analyzer centrifuge. The
measurement was conducted by pipetting 400 μL of the sample
into a polycarbonate tube cell. The tube was then inserted into an
equipment to measure the sedimentation profiles along the sample length
during the centrifugation. The software attached to the system recorded
the real-time transmission profiles at the certain intervals.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterizations
The polydispersity index (PDI), weight, and number-average molecular
weight (Mw and Mn) of the polymer observed using GPC are shown in Table 2. The 1H NMR spectra of the COPAM were recorded after the sample was dissolved
in D2O, as shown in Figure S3. The peak at 1.4 ppm and around 3.1–3.7 ppm showed the presence
of methyl and ethylene protons in the polymer units. The peaks between
2.0 and 2.4 ppm indicate the existence of methane (−CH3) in the polymer backbone. R–CO–NH2 and C–H absorption peaks were observed at 7.6 and 6.9 ppm,
revealing the formation of major polyacrylamide functional groups
in the polymer spectrum.42 The XPS (Figure S4) and CHNS–O (Table 2) analysis of the dried samples
confirmed that C, N, and O are present in both GO–COPAM and
zwitterionic rGO–COPAM composites, with the addition of sulfur
in the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM sample, which confirmed the successful
functionalization of the material using 1,3-propane sultone.

Figure 1 depicted
the ATR–FTIR spectra of GO, COPAM, and zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
composites. The spectrum of GO sheets displayed the bands at 1069.7,
1395.5, and 3420 cm–1, representing C–O stretching,
O–H bending, and O–H asymmetric/symmetric vibrations
of the GO epoxide group.43,44 In the COPAM spectrum,
it has been observed that the vibration peak at 967 cm–1 is representing the quaternary ethoxylated group of ammonium molecules
in the ATAC cationic monomer.45,46 The peaks at 1649 and
1117 cm–1 denoted the adsorption bands of C–O–C
bonds and C–H stretching vibrations, the 3321 and 1700 cm–1 peaks correspond to the carbonyl (C=O) functionalities,
while the amide vibrational bands emerged around 2923 and 1548 cm–1, respectively.47 Contrarily,
the spectrum of the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM sample showed the
combination of peaks found in GO and COPAM samples. However, in the
GO spectrum, the peak at 1069.7 cm–1 became weaker
and the peak at 1395.5 cm–1 shifted to the higher
wavenumber, which might be due to the hydrolyzable covalent cross-links
formed between COPAM and GO.48,49 Similarly, the peaks
observed at 2923 and 3321 cm–1 in the COPAM spectra
were also observed in the composites while shifted slightly to lower
wavelengths (2859 and 3302 cm–1), elucidating the
formation of hydrogen bonds. The additional adsorption peak at 1040
cm–1 on the composite materials corresponds to the
SO3 group from 1,3-propane sultone, leading to the formation
of anionic character of the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM structure
that promotes the dispersion stability in the presence of high ionic
strength brines.28,50,51 TGA
was carried out between 25 and 900 °C heating, the TGA curves
of COPAM, GO–COPAM, and zwitterionic rGO–COPAM samples
are shown in Figure 2. The TGA analysis demonstrated that between 50 and 150 °C,
all the three samples displayed a negligible weight loss, as a result
of the surface desorption of water molecules. It can also be observed
that compared to COPAM and GO–COPAM samples, the zwitterionic
rGO–COPAM composites show smaller weight loss overall, indicating
a highly stable material at harsh conditions, which is due to the
presence of the SO3 group of zwitterion character. However,
the weight lost on COPAM is roughly divided into three stages: at
around 400 °C, almost 20% of the sample weight was lost; at around
700 °C, almost 12% loss was observed; and more than 3% weight
loss was observed after heating up to 900 °C, corresponding to
the minor disintegration of the surface components on the polymer.
Contrarily, the neat polymer showed significant loss of weight (∼45%)
until 350 °C, probably because of the polymer decompositions
at elevated temperature, and more weight loss followed on the same
material to around 80% from 450 °C and above, which is because
of ammonia evolution and chain scission of the polymer at high temperature.52−54 Overall, the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
composites have high-temperature durability because of the covalent
functionalization that occurred between the COPAM and rGO.

and zwitterionic rGO–COPAM nanocomposites.

Figure 2 TGA profiles of COPAM, GO–COPAM and zwitterionic-rGO–COPAM nanocomposites.

The
TEM and SEM images of the GO nanosheets are shown in Figure 3a,b, the TEM images show exemplarily
crumble and wrinkle-like nature of GO. The SEM image described the
smooth surface of GO, confirming that the sheets in GO are linked
to one another. Figure 3c,d shows the SEM structure of the freeze-dried zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
composites showing the stable dispersion and microstructure of materials,
indicating that the polymer has been grafted to the GO sheets, confirming
the appearance of chemical bonds in the composites. Moreover, the
superimposition of GO with the COPAM confirms that the zwitterionic
rGO–COPAM interaction is not only a physical contact but also
a strong chemical adhesion.28,55 SEM–EDX reaffirm
the existence of C, N, O, and S in the composite material, as illustrated
in Figure 3e. The presence
of C, O, N, and S is also confirmed by elemental analysis, and the
percentage of each element is shown in Table 2. Interestingly, the presence of S in the
EDS mapping and elemental analysis of the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
proposed that some functionalization of the sample has successfully
occurred together with the polymer chain alkylation which results
after reacting with 1,3-propane sultone. The concentration of zwitterionic
rGO–COPAM in aqueous dispersion was obtained when the known
volume of the sample was dried in vacuo.

3.2 Dispersion Stability Analysis
The ability to address the challenges of polymer nanoparticle composite
stability at high temperature and high ionic strength into oil reservoir
conditions is presented in this work. First, in our preliminary evaluation,
we pursue to select polyacrylamide and GO nanosheets as a nanocomposite
of interest to produce a modified composite that is stabilized under
high ionic strength. To establish the guideline for stability and
dispersion, two testing brines were selected: (1) APIB and (2) FB,
which are normally discovered predominantly in deep oil reservoirs.
The composition and relative weight percentage of salts are shown
in Table 1. In comparison
to APIB, FB possesses a much complex variety of salts and unquestionably
greater number of divalent ions. A preliminary study was initiated
on the synthesized composite (GO–COPAM), which reveals that
the composite was unstable in both mixtures of APIB and FB after sample
preparation stage and aging for 1 day at 80 °C, as illustrated
in Figure 4. This is
due to the electrostatic cross-linking between GO sheets caused by
divalent ions and consequently led to destabilization of the solution.

Figure 4 GO–COPAM
dispersion in APIB and FB showing an unstable mixture after preparation
stage and 1 day of aging at 80 °C.

As discussed in the Introduction section, zwitterionic species and
poly-zwitterions provide good dispersibility in harsh conditions such
as high ionic strength brines because they exhibit the antipolyelectrolyte
effect.27 Therefore, a copolymer containing
sulfobetaine zwitterionic groups was developed in this project. In
the first instance, a COPAM of AA and ATAC were prepared via free-radical
polymerization at 80 °C for 6 h using ACPA as the initiator,
as shown in Scheme 1 (stage 1). The interaction between COPAM and GO sheets occurred
through hydrogen bonding and covalent functionalization of amino groups
in the polymer chain producing a covalent attachment with graphene
basal plane as depicted by FTIR analysis as shown in Figure 1.

Scheme 1 Schematic
of Synthesis Methods of COPAM, GO–COPAM, and Zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
Composites
In the first place,
GO was partially reduced through the interaction of l-ascorbic
acid to enhance the GO graphitic domains that improve the stability
and enable interaction with the polymer chains. The cooled solution
of partial rGO was later added to the COPAM solution as illustrated
in Scheme 1 (stage
2). The obtained rGO–COPAM was separated by precipitation,
cleaned, as well as a further consequent reaction was carried out
with 1,3-propane sultone, which lead to the formation of zwitterionic
character on the rGO–COPAM composites (zwitterionic rGO–COPAM),
as can be seen in Scheme 1 (stage 3). It would be expected from the purely zwitterionic
polymer to be charge free, but this new zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
probably has anionic groups arising from the sheets of rGO enabling
material stabilization. In our finding, the zeta potential (Figure 8b) showed that the
surface charge of the prepared material is anionic in nature (negative
charge), which is due to the ionization of phenolic and carboxylic
acid groups in the solution,5,56,57 confirming that the formation of stable GO–COPAM solution
should be promoted not just by hydrophilicity of GO but the electrostatic
repulsion.

The long-term thermal stability and dispersibility
of the aqueous zwitterionic rGO–COPAM mixture in APIB and FB
at 80 °C was investigated. Composites (10 mL) were added to 90
mL of each of the individual brine solution to obtain 100 mL of mixture.
Sonication of the mixture was conducted for 5 min to obtain a homogeneous
dispersion, whose aggregates are free after visual inspection. Before
aging the samples, both GO–COPAM and zwitterionic rGO–COPAM
composites undergo initial stability testing using the turbiscan analyzer
to monitor the sedimentation behavior by the transmission or backscattering
profile against the sample height with scan every 5 min for different
time intervals (2, 6, 12, and 24 h), as shown in Figure 5, while transmission and backscattering
data are presented in Figures S5 and S6. The transmission/backscattering profiles use the light rays to
capture the changes in the particle sedimentation within the measuring
cell. At a certain interval of time, when sedimentation occurs, the
changes in transmission or backscattering vary with the sample height.
In this work, the GO–COPAM sample showed significant sedimentation
in both APIB and FB after 24 h scan, as shown in Figure 5a,b, whereas the zwitterionic
rGO–COPAM composites displayed excellent stability in both
APIB and FB throughout the scanning period, as can be seen in Figure 5c,d.

in (c) APIB and (d) FB after preparation, with scan every 5 min for
the duration of, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h.

To understand
the long-term stability of zwitterionic rGO–COPAM composites,
the solution was stored and left undisturbed at 80 °C for 120
days. A small portion of each of the prepared dispersion was taken
for spectroscopic analysis at the initial preparation stage and after
1 day (24 h), followed by 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days for the purpose
of characterization. Photos of the aliquots are taken for visual stability
test and no notable indication of settling, sedimentation, or instability
of the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM dispersion was observed in each
of the APIB or FB, as shown in Figure 6. However, for quantitative
analysis, we first examined the dispersion stability by measuring
the UV–vis spectroscopy of the samples. As can be seen in Figure 7, the results at
the preparation stage and after aging until 120 days at 80 °C
showed a slight difference in the APIB solution, but changes was observed
in FB dispersion especially at 120 days of storage, showing a superimposable
character where the peak of GO dispersion shifted from >230, and
the absorption in the whole spectral region increases with time, proving
that the composite stability in the FB reduces at 120 days.

portion

and FB (bottom).

solution after 1, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of aging at 80 °C
in APIB (a) and FB (b).

The stability of the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM composite at high
temperature in the brines was further confirmed by the changes in
hydrodynamic diameter (HD) or size and zeta potential using DLS technique,
as shown in Figure 8. The DLS results revealed that the average
HD of the pure GO sheet in water was 701 ± 80 nm. At the initial
preparation stage of the composite, the average HD was found to be
900 ± 10 and 1015 ± 11 nm in the API and FB brine solution,
respectively. However, the diameters reduce to 870 and 928 after 1
day of aging, displaying a good stability with time, showing a diameter
approximately 750 nm over the storage period in both APIB and FB.
Zeta potential analysis also showed the improvement in stability with
zwitterionic rGO–COPAM composite at both APIB and FB over the
storage time, and it was also observed that the zeta potential value
of both solutions start to improve after aging at 80 °C compared
to that of the initial preparation, which became approximately −38
± 3 mV in APIB and −32 ± 2 in FB. However, in FB
after 120 days of aging, the zeta potential decreases to around −24
± 2 mV, which is consistent with the obtained UV–vis spectroscopy
analysis results. The composite dispersion in brine was assumed to
agree with the behavior of pseudo-spherical nanoparticles where the
rGO nanosheets wrapped by the chains of zwitterionic COPAM. At high
ionic strength brines, the presence of electrolyte ions can enhance
the interactions of the ionic groups in the zwitterionic sulfobetaine
polymers, creating the chain expansion by providing adequate steric
repulsion, thereby preventing the flocculation/aggregation of the
composite materials.27,29

(b) of zwitterionic rGO–COPAM solution after 0, 1, 10, 30,
60, 90, and 120 days of aging at 80 °C in APIB and FB.

The dispersion stability
of zwitterionic rGO–COPAM was also investigated using LUMiSizer-6110
to understand the sedimentation behavior as described in the literature.58,59 As we can see from Figures 9 and S7, the stability of the dispersion
become more obvious with aging in both APIB and FB, although after
120 days in FB, the instability index starts to increase, which is
also supporting the observation made in UV–vis and zeta potential
analysis. This is probably because the GO nanosheets start to agglomerate
after 120 days because of the presence of complex salt, thereby creating
higher open particle bed structure, which aggregated more by the applied
centrifugal force. Overall, based on the visual and spectroscopic
analysis, the zwitterionic rGO–COPAM displayed an outstanding
and promising stability in the presence of high-ionic-strength brines
including CaCl2 and MgCl2 because there is no
observable flocculation or precipitation and only negligible differences
were observed over time in the monitored transmittance. Therefore,
it could be revealed that the relative stability of the composite
dispersion may have likely prolonged above 120 days in APIB28 because up to the storage period spent in this
experiment, there was negligible formation in the destabilization
of the formed materials, but no longer than 90 days in complex FB.

4 Conclusions
Stabilization of polymer nanocomposites in high-ionic-strength brines
is a challenging issue. This study developed a new way to enhance
the stability of GO polyacrylamide nanocomposites at high-temperature
and high-ionic-strength brines. COPAM was covalently attached to the
partial rGO via free-radical polymerization and reacted further with
1,3-propane sultone to accomplish zwitterionic groups. Compared to
GO–COPAM, zwitterionic rGO–COPAM dispersions showed
that no noticeable sedimentation or flocculation observed, the particle
size measured was smaller with large zeta potentials, and the instability
index derived from LUMiSizer was smaller over a storage of 120 days
at 80 °C under both APIB and FB conditions. It also showed that
the dispersion stability was better in APIB than in FB, where the
GO-sheet conjugated structure may have been altered after 90 days
in the FB. FTIR and other chemical analysis suggested that the formation
of zwitterionic character on the rGO–COPAM composites was responsible
for the excellent temperature stability and dispersibility in the
presence of high salinity and high temperature. Such results suggest
that the zwitterionic molecules could be used as a stability enhancer
for different particles, and the zwitterionic polyacrylamide–GO
systems possess greater potential for future enhanced oil recovery
applications.
