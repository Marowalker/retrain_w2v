In
this study, pressurized method was used to dry lignite at moderate
temperature to change its pore structure but preserve its oxygen-containing
functional groups. The effects of drying conditions (time, pressure,
and temperature) on equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and pore structure
of dewatered coals were investigated, and the correlations between
pore structure and EMC were also evaluated. The pore structure parameters
of raw coal and dewatered coals were measured by nitrogen adsorption
experiments. The EMC of dewatered coals was obtained by gravimetric
method. The results indicated that the porous structure of dewatered
coal was jointly affected by three factors (drying time, pressure,
and temperature) in the initial pressurized drying stage. The drying
pressure exhibited obvious effect in the initial stage of drying lignite.
Destruction of pores under pressure was prevented due to the water
present in these pores. To further improve the pore structures of
dehydrated coals obtained by high-pressure treatment, the temperature
was increased to above 140 °C under 3 MPa; thus, a large number
of macropores were evolved into mesopores. Furthermore, the experiments
on water reabsorption by dewatered coals indicated that the EMC (0.15–0.18)
of dehydrated coal was the lowest when the pressure was 3 MPa, temperature
was 140–160 °C, and the time required was 30 min. The
moisture readsorption contents of dehydrated coals were found to be
positively correlated with its pore volume at high relative humidity.
When the relative humidity was below 20%, they were related to specific
surface areas or oxygen-containing functional groups. Therefore, pressure
in the process of drying lignite was the main factor influencing the
pore structure and the water reabsorption of dewatered coals, and
the drying temperature was dominant under the pressurizing conditions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lignite is a primary and important energy source that constitutes
significant supplies for both energy and chemical feedstock because
of its abundance, easy access, and low mining cost.1 It has been estimated that nearly half of the world’s
total coal reserves consists of lignite.2 However, its high moisture content (25–65%) results in its
low heat value and utilization efficiency and high transportation
cost.3,4 Most lignite is exclusively used as fuel
in power plants built near coal mines or as raw material in the chemical
industry. Nonetheless, the use of lignite in practical applications
has several disadvantages, including low energy efficiency, environmental
pollution, and high costs.5

The high
moisture content of lignite is mainly determined by its
porous structure and the presence of abundant oxygen-containing functional
groups in it structure.6,7 Reduction in the moisture content
of lignite is extremely important before its industrial applications.
Therefore, lignite needs to be dried for its effective utilization.
Park et al.8 and Pusat et al.9 confirmed that the removal of moisture from coal
particles increased with the increase in the drying gas temperature
and gas velocity. Internal heat and mass were found to transfer better
through smaller particles because of their larger surface area. Zhang
et al.10 studied a new dewatering process,
namely, vibration mechanical thermal expression (VMTE) process. The
water content in lignite was found to decrease with increase in temperature,
time, pressure, and vibration. The dewatering process of VMTE is better
than the mechanical thermal expression (MTE) process. During the dewatering
process of lignite, its physicochemical structure was affected obviously
by different drying conditions. Based on previous studies,11,12 changes in pore structure of lignite include the collapse of pore
structure caused by shrinkage stress; opening, closing, and cross-linking
of pores; and thermal decomposition of organic macromolecular structures
at high temperature.13 Moreover, according
to literature reports, in the drying process, the pore structure shrank
with the evaporation of moisture, and the shrinkage was found to be
irreversible.14,15 Evans16 reported that pore structure collapsed a little at the beginning
of drying; smaller pore structure was destroyed when more than 80%
of water content was removed; and finally, pore structure did not
change when more than 90% of water content was removed in the drying
process of Yallourn lignite. Zhang et al.17 studied the changing rules of the course of lignite thermally upgraded
and found that specific surface area and most probable pore size decreased
with increasing drying temperature and time. Bergins et al.18,19 studied three different types of lignite by MTE and concluded that
the volume of macropores decreased and that of mesopores increased
with increasing temperature. Lester et al.20 reported that rapid diffusion of water vapor in lignite was the
main reason for the collapse of the pore structure.

For the
water reabsorption behavior of lignite, Tahmasebi et al.21 reported that physical and chemical structure
(pore structure and oxygen-containing functional groups) of lignite
exhibited important influence on water readsorption. Notably, the
oxygen-containing functional groups (the carboxyl groups, in particular)
of lignite play an important role in water adsorption, and the hydrogen
bond formed between the oxygen-containing functional groups and water
contributes significantly to the water adsorption process.17,22,23 Some researchers24,25 studied water readsorption mechanism of lignite and found that water
was readsorbed as a monolayer on the surface of dewatered coal (DC)
through hydrogen bond, followed by multilayer adsorption by readsorption
on the monolayer. It has been concluded that the correlation between
oxygen-containing functional groups of lignite and water readsorption
behavior of lignite has been validated effectively; however, the correlation
between pore structure and water readsorption behavior of lignite
has not been reported in relevant literatures under the condition
that oxygen-containing functional groups of lignite remain unchanged.

Not only does the pore structure of lignite change at high temperature
but also its oxygen-containing functional groups exhibit variation.
Therefore, the pressurized method was used to dry lignite at moderate
temperature to preserve the oxygen-containing functional groups in
this study. The effects of drying conditions (time, pressure, and
temperature) on equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and pore structure
of dewatered coals were investigated, and the correlations between
pore structure and EMC were also evaluated.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Drying Behavior of Lignite
under Different
Operating Conditions
Figure 1 exhibits the effects of drying time and pressure on
the drying efficiency (DE) of lignite at the temperature of 110 °C. Figure 1a demonstrates that
the DE increases with increasing drying time. When drying pressure
is 0.1 MPa at 110 °C, the DE with a drying time of 60 min is
4.5 times with that of 10 min. However, the DE increased gently when
the drying time was more than 30 min under other pressures. Figure 1b exhibits that with
the increase in drying pressure to 3 MPa, the DE sharply increases.
When the drying times were 60, 45, 30, 20, and 10 min at 110 °C,
the DE of dewatered coal obtained under 3 MPa was 1.06, 1.25, 1.44,
1.67, and 2.07 times with that under 0.1 MPa pressure, respectively.
When drying pressure increases from 3 to 10 MPa, DE presents a significant
downward trend, thus moisture could not easily escape from lignite
when the coal was densified under higher pressure. The thickness of
the samples prepared under different pressures (1, 3, 5, 7, and 10
MPa) was 9.22, 8.80, 8.42, 7.00, and 6.21 mm; and their specific volume
was 407.7, 389.2, 372.3, 309.6, and 274.6 mm3 g–1, respectively. It could be considered that the effect of drying
pressure on the removal of water from lignite was obvious, and it varied under different conditions.

Figure 1 Effect
of (a) drying time and (b) pressure on DE of lignite (T = 110 °C).

The DE of dewatering
coal was the highest under 3 MPa, and the
influences of temperature and time on DE could not be objectively
investigated. So in Figure 2, the effect of temperature and time on DE was investigated
at 5 MPa instead of 3 MPa. Effects of drying time and temperature
on the DE of lignite at the pressure of 5 MPa are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2b shows that drying temperature
has obvious influence on DE. When drying temperature exceeds 110 °C,
rapid variations in DE are observed. The higher the temperature, the
higher the DE of lignite. When temperature is above 100 °C, the
state of water is rapidly transited from liquid to vapor. Thus, when
drying temperature is below 110 °C, only the surface moisture
of lignite is slowly removed; however, at above 110 °C, part
of inherent moisture is also removed in vapor state. When the drying
temperature is 50, 80, 110, 140, and 160 °C at 5 MPa, respectively,
the DE of dewatered coal obtained at 60 min (drying time) is 1.76,
1.24, 1.14, 1.05, and 1.03 times with that at 10 min, respectively.
When the drying time is 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min, respectively,
the DE of dewatered coal at 160 °C (drying temperature) is 4.39,
3.29, 2.78, 2.66, and 2.58 times that at 50 °C, respectively.
Compared to drying temperature, drying time had smaller effect on
DE under pressurized condition, which was significantly different
from that under room pressure (0.1 MPa in Figure 1a). The water in lignite generally undergoes
two processes including evaporation of surface water and removal of
internal water during drying. The experimental results showed that
pressure affected the initial stage of lignite drying and temperature
might eliminate the decrease in DE by high pressure, which should
be closely related to the pore structure of lignite.

Figure 2 Effect of (a) drying
time and (b) temperature on DE of lignite
(p = 5 MPa).

Figure 3 shows
infrared
spectrograms of raw coal (RC) and different coals obtained under different
dewatering temperatures. The peaks corresponding to oxygen-containing
functional groups are located at 3500–3000 and 1650–1600
cm–1. The oxygen-containing functional groups of
the samples (RC, DC110, DC140, and DC160) hardly exhibited any variation.
When the drying temperature was below 160 °C, the oxygen-containing
functional groups of the samples were preserved. Thus, it could be
concluded that there was no release of volatiles in the process of
pressurized dewatering. Therefore, volatile substances did not affect
the DE of lignite during drying.

different dewatered coals

2.2 Evolution of Pore Structural Parameters of
Lignite under Different Drying Conditions
2.2.1 Effects
of Drying Time on Pore Structure
Parameter of Lignite
Table 1 lists pore structural parameters of raw lignite and
dewatered coals obtained at different drying times. The pore structural
parameters decreased gradually with increasing drying time, and they
were significantly lower than those of raw lignite. Pore shrank and
swelled into a gel-like structure with the removal or absorption of
water in coal.11,12 As mentioned above, water in
coal was removed faster at the beginning of drying of lignite, which
completely corresponds to the changes in pore structure. Compared
to raw coal, the DCP3T110t10 dewatered
coal obtained from raw lignite was jointly affected by three factors
(drying time, pressure, and temperature). In contrast, dewatered coals
dried for more than 10 min were affected by only one factor (drying
time) compared to dewatered coals obtained at 10 min of drying. Isothermal
adsorption/desorption curves of raw coal and dewatered coals under
different drying times are shown in Figure 4. Clearly, little change is observed in p/p0 < 0.1, which indicates
that operating conditions did not affect the micropores. The macropores
were destroyed in lignite and adsorption/desorption quantities generally
decreased according to p/p0 > 0.9. The types of pore structures were cylindrical bore or
flaky
and did not lead to any change in lignite-based hysteresis of the
isothermal adsorption/desorption curve.

coals obtained under different drying times.

2.2.2 Effects
of Drying Pressure on Pore Structural
Parameters of Lignite
Table 2 summarizes pore structural parameters of raw lignite
and dewatered coal under different drying pressures. The pore structural
parameters of dewatered coals first decreased and then increased with
increasing pressure and were also significantly lower than those of
raw lignite. This was not the same variation trend as that of DE vs
pressure. This phenomenon illustrated that the destruction of the
pore structure was affected by two factors including pressurization
and removal of water. However, the transition points of two factor
actions were different, the former was 5 MPa and the latter was 3
MPa. Thus, it could be considered that destruction of the pore structure
not only exhibited a relationship with removal of water but also with
outside effect factor (e.g., pressure). Therefore, two dewatered coals
with similar DEs when drying pressure was 1 and 10 MPa, respectively,
presented obviously different pore structural parameters. Compared
to raw coal, the saltation occurred in dewatered coal under drying
pressure of 1 MPa was the same as time went. There were obvious changes
in specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore diameter.
This was probably attributed to the fact that raw lignite was subjected
to different pressures, temperatures, and drying times. Moreover,
water in macropores was removed and then macropores were compressed
and even broken; however, this was not observed in case of smaller
pores. Therefore, this process mainly influenced the specific surface
area, pore volume, and average pore diameter. Figure 5 shows the isothermal adsorption/desorption
curves of raw coal and dewatered coal under different drying pressures.
Clearly, micropores were not affected by these operating conditions,
and macropores were destroyed in lignite when p/p0 > 0.9. The types of pore structures were
cylindrical
bore or flaky and did not exhibit any change in lignite-based hysteresis
of isothermal adsorption/desorption curve.

2.2.3 Effects
of Drying Temperature on Pore Structural
Parameters of Lignite
Table 3 presents the pore structural parameters of raw lignite
and dewatered coals obtained under different temperatures. The specific
surface area and pore volume reduced gradually; and the average pore
diameter decreased a little and then increased with increase in drying
temperature. This indicated that bigger pores turned into smaller
pores when water in the coal was removed and then the pore structures
were destroyed. Moreover, the pore structural parameters of dewatered
coal obtained at 140 °C decreased abruptly. Figure 2b exhibits that the DE also
increases suddenly. The pores were destroyed when the temperature
was higher than 140 °C. Moreover, a relationship was also observed
between pore structure and water content in the coal.

Water in pores prevented
them from being destroyed. The isothermal
adsorption/desorption curves of raw coal and dewatered coals under
different drying temperatures are shown in Figure 6. Clearly, adsorption quantity gradually
reduces for p/p0 <
0.1 when temperature is above 110 °C, which indicates that operating
conditions affect the micropores and decrease their volume. Moreover,
macropores were also destroyed in lignite with p/p0 > 0.9. At the same time, the types of pore
structures were cylindrical bore or flaky and did not exhibit any
change in lignite-based hysteresis of isothermal adsorption/desorption
curve.

dewatered coals under different drying temperatures.

2.3 Effects of Operating Conditions
on Equilibrium
Moisture Content of Dewatered Coal
The equilibrium moisture
content (EMC) of dewatered coal at 30 °C and under relative humidity
of 95% was measured, and the results are presented in Figure 7. Both drying time and pressure
reduce the EMC of dewatered coal; however, EMC changes little when
drying time is above 30 min or drying pressure is above 3 MPa. This
phenomenon indicates that excessive increase in drying time and pressure
is not a good choice. Comparative analysis of the two factors reveals
that the effect of drying pressure is more powerful on properties
of lignite.

Figure 7 Effects of (a) drying time and (b) pressure on EMC of the dewatered
lignite (T = 110 °C).

Figure 8 shows
the
effects of drying time and temperature on EMC of the dewatered coal
at 30 °C and under relative humidity of 95%. Figure 8a demonstrates that drying
time has little effect on EMC. On the other hand, the EMC of dewatered
coal decreases obviously with increasing drying temperature. Comparison
of these three factors indicates that the pressure in the process
of drying lignite is the main factor influencing the water reabsorption
of dewatered coal, and drying temperature is dominant under the pressurizing
condition.

Figure 8 Effects of (a) drying time and (b) temperature on EMC of the dewatered
lignite (p = 5 MPa).

Figure 9 shows
EMC
results of raw coal and dewatered coals obtained under different drying
conditions (time, pressure, and temperature), at 30 °C, and under
relative humidity of 95%. The EMC values of dewatered coals first
decreased and then changed slightly with increasing drying time and
pressure.

Figure 9 Relations of EMC of the raw coal and dewatered coals prepared under
the drying conditions.

Water in lignite was removed and pore structure was destroyed
when
pressure impacted raw lignite in the drying process. Open pores were
transformed into close pores when drying pressure was increased excessively,
which restrained pore volume change and water readsorption of dewatered
coal. For the EMC of dewatered coal obtained under different temperatures,
it does not change obviously with the increase of drying temperature
from 50 to 80 °C. The EMC of dewatered coal obtained under different
pressure conditions was almost the same. The EMC of dewatered coal
obtained above 110 °C reduced faster. The phenomenon should be
related to water types and porous structure of the dewatered coal.
There are three forms of water, namely, free water, water bound in
pores (capillary water), and water bound to surface functional groups
(bound water: multilayer water and monolayer water). The first stage
involves the removal of free water. The second stage is the desorption
of capillary water. The third and fourth stages of dewatering correspond
to the loss of molecular (multilayer and monolayer) water.26 Free water was mainly removed at lower drying
temperature, whereas multilayer water even monolayer water could be
removed at higher drying temperatures. Consequently, lower drying
temperature and pressure are beneficial to the water readsorption
of dewatered coal.

In other words, the porous structure of dewatered
coal obtained
under different drying conditions is closely related to its water
readsorption behavior. The correlations between the pore volume of
dewatered coal and different drying conditions are shown in Figure 10. The pore volume
of lignite decreases with increase of drying time, temperature, and
pressure. The effect of drying temperature on pore volume of lignite
is the most significant; the pore volume of dehydrated coal prepared
at 160 °C is half that of the sample at 50 °C. The pore
volume of dehydrated coal prepared under 10 MPa is only 0.28 times
that of the sample obtained under 1 MPa. Drying time has little effect
on pore volume. The pore volume of dewatered coal prepared under 5
MPa and 50 °C is the largest among all samples. With the increase
of drying temperature, the pore volume of lignite decreases sharply.
Combination of the results of Figures 7 and 8 indicate that pore volume
is one of the important physical parameters for the water readsorption
capacity of dewatered coal. The more pore volume of dewatered coal
decreases, the less water is reabsorbed on it. The dewatered lignite
undergoes water readsorption on multimolecular layers by hydrogen
bond, which is also related to its large pore volume. Larger pore
volume leads to more moisture content and formation of more hydrogen
bonds, which result in more content of reabsorbed water of dewatered
coal. The EMC (0.15) of dewatered coal DCP5T160t30 obtained under optimum drying conditions is the lowest.
The pore volume of raw lignite is largest among all samples; therefore,
the EMC of raw lignite (0.34) is the highest. The EMC of raw lignite
is more than twice the EMC of dewatered coal (60 min, 5 MPa, 160 °C).

Figure 10 Relationship
between pore volume of dewatered coal and drying conditions.

2.4 Relationships
between Pore Structural Parameters
and Moisture Readsorption Content of Dewatered Coal
Figure 11 shows the relationship
between total pore volume (Vtotal), mesopore
volume (Vmeso-), and specific surface
area and EMC or moisture readsorption content of dewatered coals. Figure 11a exhibits a linear
relation between EMC of dewatered coals and total pore volume at 30
°C and under relative humidity of 97%. Figure 11b demonstrates a linear relation between
moisture readsorption content of dewatered coal and mesopore volume
at 30 °C and under different relative humidity (RH = 21–75%).
The adsorption of water molecule on micropore is initially monolayer
adsorption, and thus the water readsorption capacity of dewatered
coal at the initial stage should be related to specific surface area. Figure 11c shows a linear
relation between moisture readsorption content of dewatered coal and
specific surface area at 30 °C and under relative humidity of
11.3%, which exhibits that the occurrence of the monolayer water readsorption
at a relative humidity of 11% is mainly affected by specific surface
area.

Figure 11 Relationships among (a) Vtotal, (b) Vmeso-, and (c) specific surface area
with EMC or moisture readsorption content of dewatered coals.

To verify the validity of the
rules mentioned above, raw coal was
placed under high temperature to remove the oxygen-containing functional
groups, and then this sample pretreated at high temperature was used
as typical example for detecting the effects of pore structural changes. Figure 12 shows infrared
spectrograms of different coals obtained under different temperatures.
The peaks corresponding to oxygen-containing functional groups affecting
water readsorption are located at 3500–3000 and 1650–1600
cm–1.27,28 The spectrograms show
the presence of few oxygen-containing functional groups when temperature
was above 600 °C. The peak corresponding to infrared absorption
of ash is located in the range of 3730–3600 cm–1. The oxygen-containing functional groups of demineralized coal are
less than that of raw coal. Thus, 600 and 700 °C were selected
as proximate temperatures to conduct coal treatment. Previous researchers
have reported that ash content shows a relationship with water readsorption.29Table 5 presents that raw lignite has a higher ash content (Ad = 27.78%). Table 5 presents that kind of lignite has a higher
ash content (Ad = 27.78%). Therefore,
raw coal was subjected to ash removal treatment using hydrochloric
acid and hydrofluoric acid, and then it was calcined at 700 °C.
As a result, the treated raw coal showed very little ash content (Ad = 1.34%), and the infrared peak of ash (3730–3600
cm–1) disappeared.

Figure 12 Infrared spectrogram of different coals
obtained under different
temperatures.

Table 4 shows the
pore structural parameters of different dried samples at high temperature.
The order of specific surface area and total pore volume of the three
samples is as follows: DCP0.1T700t60Afree > DCP0.1T700t60 > DCP0.1T600t60. Figure 13 shows relationship between
pore structural parameters and moisture readsorption content of dewatered
coals. Water readsorption capacity in coal was positively correlated
with total pore volume and specific surface area when the coal was
placed under a higher-relative-humidity (p/p0 > 0.38) environment. The order of EMC of
the
three samples is as follows: DCP0.1T700t60Afree > DCP0.1T700t60 > DCP0.1T600t60. Although
DCP0.1T600t60 contains the most oxygen-containing
functional groups among these samples, its water readsorption capacity
is independent at the relative humidity of p/p0 > 0.38. In the lower relative humidity
environment
of p/p0 < 0.38, the
moisture readsorption content order of the three samples is DCP0.1T600t60 > DCP0.1T700t60 > DCP0.1T700t60Afree, which shows that EMC is positively correlated
with the
quantities of oxygen-containing functional groups in the samples and
independent of their pore structures. When the drying temperature
was below 160 °C, it did not affect the total oxygen-containing
functional groups in coals.17,30 Therefore, water readsorption
content in coal was found to be related to specific surface area when
coal was placed in a lower-relative-humidity environment. Above all,
water readsorption content in coal is related to the total pore volume
when coal is placed in a higher-relative-humidity environment; however,
in a lower-relative-humidity environment, water readsorption content
in coal is related to specific surface area. Water readsorption content
in coal is not related to ash content in the samples.

content curves of samples.

3 Conclusions
A new
drying method (involving preservation of oxygen-containing
functional groups), namely, pressurized dewatering, was used for lignite
drying for the first time in this study. The pressure influenced the
initial stage of drying lignite and the effect on the removal of internal
water from lignite was obvious. The increase of drying temperature
might eliminate the decrease in drying efficiency (DE) under high
pressure. The porous structures of dewatered coals were jointly affected
by three factors (drying time, pressure, and temperature) for less
than 10 min of drying under pressurized drying, and dewatered coals
dried for more than 10 min were only affected by one factor (drying
time). Water in pores could prevent the pores of lignite from being
destroyed under pressure; as a result, porous structural parameters
of dehydrated coals obtained under higher pressure were large and
their equilibrium moisture contents (EMCs: 0.23–0.30) were
relatively high. However, the internal water of lignite could be effectively
removed when temperature was elevated to above 140 °C, and therefore
it had significant effect on pore structure and could decrease the
EMC of dehydrated coals under higher pressure. Consequently, the experimental
results indicated that the EMC (0.15–0.18) of dehydrated coal
was the lowest when the pressure was 3 MPa, the temperature was 140–160
°C, and the time was 30 min. By correlating the moisture readsorption
contents of dehydrated coals with their pore structures at different
relative humidity, the results showed that the moisture readsorption
contents of dehydrated coals were positively correlated with its pore
volume at high humidity, and they were related to specific surface
areas or oxygen-containing functional groups in a lower-relative-humidity
environment. Over all, pressure during the drying process of lignite
was the main factor affecting the pore structure and the water reabsorption
of dewatered coal, and temperature played a dominant role under the
pressurizing conditions.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Coal Sample and Its Preparation
Lignite
from Inner Mongolia in China was selected for this study. The raw
coal (RC) was ground and sieved to the particle sizes of 0.150–0.178
mm under N2 atmosphere prior to its use. If the sample
size is larger than 0.178 mm, the coal sample will be very hard pressurized
to be a 13 mm diameter wafer, whereas if the sample size is smaller
than 0.15 mm, the moisture content would decrease obviously during
grinding. So, the sample was kept in a tightly closed container. The
proximate and ultimate analysis results of the coal sample are listed
in Table 5, wherein the full moisture content (Mt) was measured at 105 °C in a nitrogen oven according
to the Chinese national standard GB/TB 212-2008.

4.2 Dewatering of Lignite
Figure 14 shows the schematic illustration
of a hydraulic press equipment used for drying raw coal under N2 atmosphere. During drying, the pressure and temperature controlled
using the pressure and temperature controllers varied from 0.1 to
10 MPa and 50 to 160 °C, respectively, to prevent the change
of oxygen-containing functional groups. The samples obtained under
different drying conditions are represented as DCPxTytz. For example, DCP1T50t20 indicates
a dehydrated coal obtained under the drying conditions of 1 MPa, 50
°C, and 20 min. The drying efficiency (DE) was calculated by
using eq 1 as follows 1  where mR is the
initial weight of the coal sample (g) and mD is the weight of the coal sample after drying (g).

Figure 14 Schematic illustration
of the drying equipment.

4.3 Measurement of Equilibrium Moisture Content
The moisture readsorption behaviors of raw coal (RC) and dewatered
coal (DC) samples were measured using a constant temperature and humidity
equipment at 30 °C under different relative humidity ranging
from 6.4 to 97%. During the measurement, the samples were weighed
in glass dishes and then placed into the equipment for 72 h to reach
the moisture adsorption equilibrium. The equilibrium moisture content
(EMC, g g–1 db) was calculated by using eq 2 as follows 2  where ma is the
weight of the coal sample after moisture readsorption (g) and md is the weight of the coal sample after drying
according to the Chinese national standard GB/TB 212-2008 (g).

Equilibrium adsorption time under relative humidity of 75% is shown
in Figure 15, which
exhibits that three dewatered coal samples obtained under ordinary
pressure and different drying temperatures can reach water readsorption
equilibrium after 10 h. As a result, 72 h were enough for different
samples to reach water readsorption equilibrium.

readsorption equilibrium time of dewatered
coal.

4.4 Analysis
of Pore Structure
The pore
structural parameters of raw coal and dewatered coals were measured
using a N2 adsorption analyzer (JW-BK122W, China) at −196
°C. Before the experiments, the coal samples were degassed at
a relatively low temperature of 50 °C for 24 h under vacuum to
avoid obvious changes of pore structure caused by the pretreatment
process. The pore size distribution and specific surface area of the
samples were calculated, respectively, by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equations31,32 according to adsorption isotherm.
