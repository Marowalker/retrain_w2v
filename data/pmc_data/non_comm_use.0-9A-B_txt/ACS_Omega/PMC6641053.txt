Organic bulk heterojunction solar
cells with a high fullerene content (larger than 70%) have been studied
in this work. The device performances of this kind of solar cell could
be tuned by adjusting the blend ratio in the active layer. An appropriate
amount of p-type semiconductor in the high fullerene content active
blend layer is beneficial for light absorbance and exciton dissociation.
The proper energy alignment between the highest occupied molecular
orbital of a p-type material and an n-type fullerene derivative has
a strong influence on the exciton dissociation efficiency. In addition,
the mechanism of photogenerated charge recombination in the solar
cells has been identified through intensity-dependent current density–voltage
(J–V) measurements and results show that the
mechanisms governing the recombination are crucial for solar cell
performance.

Introduction
Owing
to the advantages of light weight, low cost, easy processability,
and compatibility with flexible substrates, organic solar cells (OSCs)
have attracted extensive attention in both academic and industrial
areas. Key processes determining the energy conversion ability of
such solar cells are much different from those of the traditional
inorganic solar cells; as a result, despite the intense research conducted
in this field, many fundamental aspects of OSCs are still not fully
understood.1 Charge generation dynamics
in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is vitally important for
photoelectric conversion.2 Because light
absorption from fullerene acceptors is weak in the visible spectral
region, the contribution of fullerene excitons to the photocurrent
has been frequently underestimated or even ignored.3 However, fullerene excitons may make a significant contribution
to free charges.3 For example, Zhang et
al.4 have reported a fullerene-based OSC
with a very low donor content and found that only 5% (in volume) of
1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane (TAPC) was
needed for the dissociation of fullerene excitons and that the photocurrent
generation was not limited by the exciton diffusion or dissociation
but rather by the transport of holes through the blending matrix.
Yang et al.5 have demonstrated that an
internal quantum efficiency as high as 80% could be obtained by adjusting
the donor–acceptor ratio to 5:95; this was an indication of
a Frenkel exciton dissociation process, whereafter, the output device
performance was profoundly influenced by the polymer aggregation within
the active film.6 Through femtosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy, Dimitrov et al.7 found that charge generation from PC71BM excitons primarily
occurs on the 0.5 ns time scale, and light absorption by fullerenes
can result in high photocurrents. Burkhard et al.8 showed that a large amount of free carriers could be generated
spontaneously at room temperature in fullerene molecules and then
be extracted to an external circuit.

Herein, organic BHJ solar
cells with a high fullerene content are studied and the charge generation
and recombination processes are particularly investigated. Reflectance
spectra measurement and photoluminescence (PL) quenching results revealed
that 10% poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was appropriate for efficient
exciton photogeneration and dissociation. We found that the large
open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the high
fullerene content devices results from the much higher relative dielectric
constant, and it is also affected by the charge recombination. By
comparing the performances of P3HT-based devices with N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methyl-phenyl)-[1,1′biphenyl]-4,4′-diamine
(TPD) and 4,4′-bis(9-carbazolyl)-biphenyl (CBP) based devices,
we found that proper energy alignment between the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the p-type material and the n-type
fullerene derivative is of great importance for PC71BM
exciton dissociation. The dominant charge recombination mechanism
in the solar cells was checked through intensity-dependent J–V measurements, and it can be
concluded that nongeminate recombination is the main charge recombination
mechanism in the P3HT- and TPD-based cells, whereas geminate recombination
dominates the loss way in the CBP-based devices.

Results and Discussion
In the devices employed herein,
P3HT and PC71BM were first employed as the p-type and n-type
constituents of the BHJ layer. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated
with a standard indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped
poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS)/BHJ/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/Al structure, where
PEDOT:PSS and PFN were the hole-extracting and electron-extracting
layers, respectively.9 We studied the impact
of the P3HT content on the devices with a constant BHJ layer thickness
of 55–60 nm (Figure S1). Current
density–voltage (J–V) characteristics obtained from devices with a P3HT concentration
ranging from 0 to 30% are displayed in Figure 1a; the corresponding performance data are
reported in Table 1. Within this concentration range, the optimum blend ratio of P3HT
to PC71BM is found to be 1:9, corresponding to a maximum
solar cell efficiency of 3.07%, with a short circuit current density
(Jsc) of 7.38 mA cm–2, a Voc of 0.90 V and a fill factor (FF)
of 46.13%. These results are very close to the reported values in
the literature.6 To facilitate the comparison,
photovoltaic parameters from all devices are presented in Figure 1b,c. It is easy to
see that the Jsc, FF, and power conversion
efficiency (PCE) values strongly depended on the P3HT content. After
adding P3HT from 0 to 10%, Jsc increased
from 0.16 to 7.38 mA cm–2, FF increased from 27.54
to 46.13%, and PCE increased from 0.03 to 3.07%. Further increase
in the P3HT content up to 30% resulted in a slight decrease in the
FF to 42.16%, whereas Jsc dramatically
dropped to 3.95 mA cm–2, thus resulting in a poor
PCE of 1.48%. To confirm the accuracy of these measurements, external
quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Figure S2) were carried out; the difference between the measured Jsc and the integrated photocurrent was found
to be negligible. Interestingly, the Voc parameter behaved quite differently with respect to Jsc and FF for a low P3HT concentration (0–5%); Voc increased with the P3HT weight fraction (from
0.75 to 0.88 V), whereas for a higher P3HT content (5–30%) Voc exhibited a relatively stable value.

a The average PCE was obtained from more than 20 devices.

To understand the impact of a small
amount of P3HT on the device
performance, reflectance spectra measurements were performed to inspect
the absorption of incident photons under real conditions. Figure 2a allows comparing
the reflectance spectra of devices with different P3HT contents. As
the P3HT loading ratio increased from 0 to 30%, devices showed an
increased reflectance in the range above 400 nm, implying that the
increasing of the P3HT content hinders light absorption in the active
layer; therefore, the P3HT content influences the exciton photogeneration.
Normalized PL spectra from thin films excited at 480 nm are shown
in Figure 2b. As indicated
by the absorption spectrum (Figure S3),
both P3HT and PC71BM could be well excited at this wavelength.
For the pure PC71BM film, the emission peak observed at
about 713 nm could be attributed to the emission from PC71BM singlet excitons.10 With the addition
of a small amount of P3HT into PC71BM, the peak value of
the emission at 713 nm was sensibly reduced. By further increasing
the P3HT content until 10%, a steadily depressed PC71BM
exciton emission is observed. This lowering of the emittance is a
direct indication of the PC71BM singlet exciton dissociation.
When the proportion of P3HT within the blend film is increased above
20%, a new emission peak located at about 645 nm, with a shoulder
around 713 nm, is observed. As there was no obvious emission from
the pure PC71BM film at 645 nm, this newly emerging peak
is assigned to the emission from P3HT; this is in agreement with previous
observations.11 Concerning the re-appearance
of the emission at 713 nm, it is possible that a 10% P3HT content
is sufficient for ensuring the efficient dissociation of PC71BM excitons, therefore, further increasing of the P3HT content is
unfavorable for the best use of fullerene excitons. Results from PL
measurements suggest that unquenched excitons less than or above 10%
loading are the reason for the decreased Jsc values.

with different P3HT contents. All curves were normalized to the excitation
light intensity. (c) Variation of charge mobility with the P3HT content.

Because of the close relationship
between the solar
cell device performance and charge carrier transport properties, the
space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was adopted to determine
the charge carrier mobility.12Figure 2c depicts both electron
mobility and hole mobility in devices as a function of the P3HT content.
The corresponding single-carrier J–V characteristics are presented in Figure S4. Clearly, the measured electron and hole mobilities, respectively,
showed a monotonic decrease and increase as the P3HT weight fraction
is increased. Results from the mobility test were consistent with
expectations because the increase in the P3HT content would increase
hole transport pathways in the blend film and at the same time hinder
the continuous motion of electrons. The hole mobility starts at a
value of 1.65 × 10–7 cm2 V–1 s–1 (for 1% P3HT) and then grows up to 1.26 ×
10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 (for 30% P3HT). Obviously, the hole transport is
quite inefficient in these devices, as testified by the low FF (<50%).
In accordance with this idea, the FF should increase monotonically
with the P3HT content. However, the steady drop in the electron mobility
with an increase in the P3HT ratio is the reason for the slight decrease
in the FF value in the higher P3HT loading regime (10–30%).
Although the charge transport seems to be more balanced for a higher
P3HT content, we deem that the value of the mobility itself has a
more profound influence on the FF than having a balanced charge transport.13

To further clarify the origin of the low
FF in high PC71BM content OSCs, voltage-dependent EQE spectra
were examined. Figure 3 shows EQE spectra from a device with 10% P3HT measured at different
electrical biases. As the applied voltage turned from 1 to −2
V, the EQE value increased markedly in the entire wavelength range.
However, the strong electric field dependence of the EQE is not a
common phenomenon in high-efficiency BJH solar cells because photogenerated
charges can be separated at the BHJ interface and then extracted to
the outside circuit efficiently.8 It is
well known that Frenkel excitons in the fullerene can transform directly
into free carriers; these free carriers either may undergo recombination
or may be extracted to the outside circuit.14 In our case, as PC71BM domains are very large, there
is a great possibility for directly generated holes and electrons
to meet and then be lost through recombination. Also, as the shape
of the EQE curves does not change with the applied voltage, it could
be confirmed that the nongeminate recombination is the primary carrier
loss pathway. When the internal electric field in the device is enhanced
(going from a positive to a negative bias), the recombination rate
of free charges can be strongly reduced, leading to a higher quantum
efficiency. Thus, the strong
dependence of the EQE upon the applied voltage is an indication of
the severe charge recombination, which is also the cause of the low
FF in the devices.

biases.

In our P3HT-based high fullerene
content
cells, Voc is dependent on the P3HT concentration
(Figure 1c) and is
much higher than that in most reported devices (blend ratio of 1:1
and Voc is typically around 0.6 V).15,16 This interesting phenomenon may be explained by the variation of
the dielectric constant (ε) of blend layers and the charge recombination
in devices because Voc in OSCs could be
determined using eVoc = Eeff – Eε– Erec,17 where Eeff is the effective bandgap, Eε describes the dielectric-related Voc loss, and Erec is the energy
loss caused by charge recombination. The composition-dependent relative
dielectric constant of the blend layer was studied by measuring the
device geometric capacitance using a simple device structure of ITO/blend
layer/Al. The relative dielectric constants of the blend layer with
different P3HT contents are shown in Figure 4, which are derived from the capacitance–voltage
measurement (the inset of Figure 4).18 It is clear that the
addition of P3HT results in a small relative dielectric constant.
For example, ε(3.74) of the 10% P3HT containing blend layer
is higher than that of the 50% P3HT containing blend layer (ε
= 2.87). As a large dielectric constant of the blend layer helps the
dissociation of charge transfer excitons,19,20 the
dielectric-related Voc loss in the high-ε
system is less serious (with a small Eε), and this is the main reason for the much larger Voc observed in high-PC71BM devices. When the
P3HT content is less than 10%, ε increases but Voc decreases. This is because the unbalanced charge transport
induces charge recombination and leads to a larger Erec value. This inference has to be confirmed by the SCLC
charge mobility measurements (Figure 2c). Beyond that, the fact that severe charge recombination
happens in extremely low P3HT content devices (<10%) could also
be verified by the dark J–V characteristics because the leakage current in the reverse bias
is larger in the low P3HT containing devices, as shown in Figure S5.

the relative dielectric constant with P3HT content. Inset: capacitance–voltage
characteristics of the blend layers measured to calculate the relative
dielectric constant.

To gain a more in-depth understanding
of the role of the p-type material in the photoactive layer, two other
p-type semiconductors, TPD and CBP, were used to fabricate high fullerene
content OSCs. It should be noted that TPD and CBP are typical hole-transporting
materials in organic light-emitting diodes,21 and they have weak absorption in the visible range.22,23 In Figure 5, current–voltage
curves measured under illumination from devices based on P3HT, TPD,
and CBP are shown. The content of P3HT, TPD, and CBP in the blend
layers is 10%. To facilitate the discussion, the output characteristic
curve of the device with 10% P3HT content is also presented, and the
parameters from J–V characterization
are summarized in Table 2. A comparison between devices with P3HT:PC71BM and TPD:PC71BM blend layers shows a simultaneous decrease in Jsc, Voc, and FF.
However, it is worth mentioning that in the TPD-based device, the Jsc value is almost half of that measured in
the P3HT-based device, and only a moderate PCE of 1.09% is achieved.
This implies that, to a certain extent, the small amount of TPD could
provide the appropriate function in terms of photoelectric conversion.
In contrast to the P3HT-based reference cell, the CBP-based device
showed very poor photovoltaic properties with a PCE of only 0.02%
and a Jsc of 0.08 mA cm–2; this was even lower than what was measured in the pure PC71BM device (Table 1), indicating the ineffectiveness of CBP in the high PC71BM content devices.

devices with

a The average PCE was obtained from more than 20 devices.

To understand the above phenomena,
the
hole transport ability in the devices was investigated through a SCLC
model.13 Current density–voltage
characteristics of hole-only devices (Figure 6a) could be described by J = (9/8)εε0μ0V2 exp(0.89(V/E0L))1/2/L3, where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer,
ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, E0 is the
characteristic field, J is the current density, L is the thickness of the blended film, V = Vapp – Vbi, Vapp is the applied potential,
and Vbi is the built-in potential, which
results from the difference in the work function of the anode and
the cathode. The hole mobilities in devices containing P3HT, TPD,
and CBP are 3.74 × 10–6, 9.06 × 10–6, and 1.51 × 10–6 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. Obviously,
the difference in charge transport ability itself could not account
for the wide variation of the device performance. EQE measurements
were performed, and spectra for all devices are shown in Figure 6b. The EQE of the
P3HT-based device exhibited a maximum value of 53%, whereas the TPD-based
device showed a much lower value of 31%, and the CBP-based device
was very close to zero quantum efficiency in the entire wavelength
range.

devices with different blend layer compositions.

Figure 7 shows
the molecular structures of the p-type materials employed
in this work and the energy level alignment in the blend layers.21,24 It is well known that during a typical exciton dissociation process
in an organic BHJ solar cell, electrons hop from the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of the p-type material to the LUMO of the
n-type material, and holes stay in the p-type material. To ensure
a high dissociation efficiency, the gap between the LUMO levels of
the p-type material and n-type material should be large enough to
overcome the exciton binding energy.25,26 However, in
the present study, as most excitons in the blend layer originate from
the photoexcitation of the n-type PC71BM, the dominant
exciton dissociation process is the hole transfer from the HOMO of
PC71BM to the HOMO of the p-type material, and this process
requires that the p-type material has a much shallower HOMO level
than that of PC71BM to provide the driving force. In P3HT-
and TPD-based devices, the value of ΔHOMO (HOMOp-type – HOMOn-type) is 0.9 and 0.5 eV, respectively,
which are believed to be large enough for allowing for the exciton
dissociation.27−29 However,
in the CBP-based device, the ΔHOMO value is −0.3 eV,
which is thus very unfavorable for the generation of free charges.
The lack of a driving force for the PC71BM exciton dissociation
in the CBP-based device directly leads to the extremely poor photovoltaic
performance.

energy level alignment of these materials. Hole transfer process from
the HOMO of PC71BM to the HOMO of the p-type materials
is also presented. ΔHOMO values of P3HT-, TPD-, and CBP-based
blends are 0.9, 0.5, and −0.3 eV, respectively.

To understand the device operation, it is important
to know the charge recombination process that is responsible for losses
in the solar cell. Measuring the light intensity dependence of the
FF and Voc has been proved to be a powerful
tool for probing dominant recombination mechanisms.30−32 The light intensity
dependence of J–V curves
is presented in Figure S6, and the extracted
FF and Voc are shown in Figure 8a,b. For P3HT- and TPD-based
devices, the FF decreases
with increasing light intensity. It is an indication that the nongeminate
recombination process is the dominant charge recombination mechanism
in these two devices because the nongeminate recombination process
is heavily dependent on the charge carrier density.33,34 The
FF of the CBP-based cell is relatively stable (around 36%) within
the test range, indicating that geminate recombination is the main
loss channel in this device because this kind of recombination is
independent of the light intensity.28 This
inference is reasonable because excitons in the CBP-based device could
not be separated into free charges, just as mentioned above. The recombination
mechanisms were further investigated by studying the dependence of Voc on the light intensity. Typically, when bimolecular
(Langevin) recombination is the loss mechanism in a BHJ solar cell,
the slope of Voc versus the natural logarithm
of the light intensity is kT/e (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature,
and e is the elementary charge), whereas a 2kT/e value will be obtained when trap-assisted
(Shockley–Read–Hall) recombination is the sole loss
mechanism.35,36 As shown in Figure 8b, Voc–light
intensity curves of P3HT- and TPD-based devices could be well fitted
with a linear curve. The slope for the P3HT-based device is 1.11kT/e, implying that the bimolecular recombination
process dominates under open-circuit conditions. A stronger dependence
of Voc on the light intensity is observed
for the TPD-based device with a slope of 1.39kT/e, which is a signal of relatively severe trap-assisted
recombination under open-circuit conditions.37 This also explains why the device performance of the TPD-based device
is not as good as that of P3HT-based devices. A linear correlation
could not be found in the CBP:PC71BM system, which is consistent
with the aforementioned result that the primary recombination mechanism
is totally different from the one in the P3HT- and TPD-based devices.

Conclusions
In this study, BHJ
solar cells with a small amount of photoactive p-type materials were
investigated. The variation of device performance with the P3HT loading
ratio suggests that at very low P3HT content, the P3HT ratio has a
profound influence on solar cell parameters. Reflectance spectra measurements
indicated that the increase in the P3HT content hinders light absorption
in the active layer, thus influencing the exciton photogeneration.
PL quenching results revealed that 10% P3HT was enough for ensuring
an efficient PC71BM exciton dissociation; further increase
in P3HT content was found to be unfavorable for the best use of the
fullerene exciton. Charge transport properties were investigated by
the SCLC method; the inference that can be drawn is that the low FF
in the devices should be ascribed to the low mobility of charge carriers;
the high Voc in the high PC71BM content devices results from the higher relative dielectric constant,
and it is also affected by the charge recombination. Moreover, we
compared the performance of P3HT:PC71BM devices with that
of TPD:PC71BM and CBP:PC71BM devices, the upshot
is that to ensure efficient PC71BM exciton dissociation,
the HOMO of the p-type material should be below the HOMO of the n-type
material. Intensity-dependent J–V characteristics demonstrated that nongeminate recombination is the
dominant charge recombination mechanism in P3HT- and TPD-based devices;
a more serious trap-assisted charge recombination found in the TPD-based
cell is thought to be responsible for the relatively poor device performance.
By rationally choosing the p-type material in the blend, it is possible
to regulate the charge recombination, thus providing good insight
into the fundamental physical processes involved.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The acceptor material PC71BM was
purchased
from Solenne BV, TPD and CBP were from Luminescence Technology Corp.,
PEDOT:PSS was from H.C. Starck Clevios, and PFN was synthesized according
to the literature.9 All materials were
used as received without further purification.

Device Fabrication
Prepatterned ITO glass substrates
were first cleaned by successive ultrasonication steps in acetone,
detergent, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol. Substrates were
then treated with an oxygen plasma for 5 min, and then a 40 nm thick
PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass. The substrates
were subsequently left to dry at 150 °C for 15 min in air and
then transferred to an N2-glovebox. The active blend layer
with a thickness of 55–60 nm were prepared by spin-coating
chlorobenzene solution on the resulting substrates followed by thermal
annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. Then, the PFN layer was deposited
by spin-casting from a 0.02% (w/v) solution in methanol at 2000 rpm
for 30 s. Finally, the 100 nm Al cathode was evaporated through a
shadow mask under a vacuum pressure lower than 10–4 Pa to define the device active area of 0.16 cm2. All
fabricated devices were encapsulated in epoxy resin inside a glovebox.

Characterization
The PCE values
were determined from the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics determined using a Keithley
2400 source-measurement unit under AM1.5G illumination by a solar
simulator. The incident light was adjusted using a set of neutral
density filters (Chroma Technology), and the illumination intensity
of the simulator was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference
cell containing a KG-5 visible color filter. The absorption spectra
were recorded with a UV–vis–near-infrared spectrophotometer
(UV2550, SHIMADZU, Japan). PL measurements were carried out through
a fluorescence spectrometer (FLSP920, Edinburgh, United Kingdom).
The capacitance spectra were recorded using an electrochemical workstation
(PGSTAT204, Metrohm Autolab).
