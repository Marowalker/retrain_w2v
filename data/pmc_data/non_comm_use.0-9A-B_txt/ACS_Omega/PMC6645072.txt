Synthesis and photophysical characterizations of two novel small molecules SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR with D–A–D
molecular structure consisting of squaraine as central unit and benzothiophene
and benzofuran as end groups are being reported. Apart from very sharp
and intense light absorption by these molecular sensitizers in near-infrared
(NIR) wavelength region, their possibility as small molecular organic
semiconductor was also explored after fabricating organic field-effect
transistors (OFETs). Results obtained from photophysical, electrochemical,
and quantum chemical studies were combined to elucidate the structural
and optoelectronic properties. Electrical characterization pertaining
to the charge-transport properties carried after OFET fabrication
exhibited field-effect mobilities of 4.0 × 10–5 and 5.4 × 10–5 cm2/(V s) for SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR, respectively. After
thermal annealing at 130 °C, the field-effect mobility was found
to increase for both squaraine dyes. Relatively facile carrier transport
in SQ-BEN-FUR compared to that of SQ-BEN-THI could be attributed to relatively higher backbone planarity as indicated
from optimized molecular structure obtained after density functional
theory calculations. This work may guide for further molecular design
and synthesis of novel squaraine dyes for high-performance OFET applications.

Introduction
Organic semiconductors
are the main class of π-conjugated
materials, which have been applied for next-generation optoelectronic
applications particularly with regard to organic field-effect transistors
(OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and organic photovoltaic
cells.1−5 Organic molecular semiconductors for OFETs have fascinated considerable
interest pertaining to their widespread applications in sensors, high-region
displays, radiofrequency identification tags, logic circuits with
low production cost, and higher plasticity.6−11 Many π-conjugated organic small molecules and polymers have
been extensively developed and applied in OFETs as n-type, p-type,
and ambipolar semiconducting materials such as pentacene,12 fused thiophene derivatives,13 diketopyrrolopyrroles,14−17 merocyanines,18,19 dinaphtho-thienothiophene,20 naphthalene-diimides,21−23 etc. with appreciable charge-carrier mobilities. Compared to polymeric
materials, small molecules have captivated more observation in OFET
applications because of their modular design allowing facile tuning
of their electronic structure and energetics like highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
energy levels. They have many intrinsic advantages, i.e., well-elucidated
molecular structures, molecular weights, high purity, and good charge-carrier
mobility.1−5 The performance of OFETs mainly depends on the structural characteristics
of the active semiconducting material as well as the processing method
employed during thin-film fabrication.24 To reduce the fabrication cost for large-area manufacturing, implementation
of solution process techniques like spin coating, blade coating, and
inkjet printing are more favorable compared to vacuum deposition methods.
However, such type of molecules should have facile solubility in organic
solvents to employ solution-based processing along with relatively
lower annealing temperatures to achieve stable and high device performance.

Squaraines come under polymethine class of dyes having zwitterionic
structures. They possess an electron-deficient four-membered squaric
acid ring at the center surrounded by two electron-donating moieties
consisting of the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D)
molecular framework. This class of organic molecules has been utilized
for organic solar cells,25 gas sensor,26 biosensing,27 nonlinear
optics,28 etc. due to intense and tunable
absorption and emission from visible to near-infrared (NIR) wavelength
region, but their application potential in the area of organic electronics
has not been well explored. In 2007, Smits et al. reported solution-processable
guaiazulenyl-derived squarylium dye29 for
NIR-sensitive light-emitting OFET applications with an ambipolar charge-carrier
mobility of 10–4 cm2/(V s). Later, Wöbkenberg
et al. reported a squaraine dye for solution-processable single-layer
organic phototransistors exhibiting ambipolar charge mobilities with
balanced hole and electron transport.30 A series of indole-based squaraine dyes were reported as air-stable
semiconductors for OFETs with the highest carrier mobility of 4.8
× 10–3 cm2/(V s) by Qiu group.31 In 2014, Gsänger et al. reported32 solution-processable squaraine dyes for OFET
application exhibiting carrier mobility in the order of 10–4–10–2 cm2/(V s). Interestingly,
there was a series of magnitude increase in the charge-carrier mobility
when J-aggregate-assisted solution shearing method was used for thin-film
processing emphasizing the importance processing technique on the
film morphology and carrier transport. Squaraine dyes are structurally
highly coplanar π-conjugated organic molecules, which have good
charge-transport property through overlapping of π-orbitals
and possess good film-forming ability. These properties of squaraine
prompted us to design and synthesize two novel solution-processable
squaraine-based small organic molecules like SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR with D–A–D molecular structure
consisting of benzothiophene and benzofuran, respectively, as π-conjugated
donor end groups, as shown in Figure 1. We have systematically studied the effect of heteroatom
(oxygen and sulfur) substitution on their photophysical properties
along with electrical characterization to explore their application
as active semiconducting molecule for solution-processed OFETs. The
synthetic route is represented in Scheme 1.

dyes.

Results and Discussion
Optical Characterization
Optical characterizations
were performed using absorption and emission spectroscopies. Electronic
absorption spectra for both of SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR recorded in dichloromethane (DCM) solution and solid-state spin-coated
thin films are shown in Figure 2. At the same time, corresponding optoelectronic data extracted
from the optical characterizations are presented in Table 1. The maximum optical absorption
(λmax) in the solution corresponding to lower energy
bands was found at 672 and 674 nm for SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR, respectively. These bands originated from the
electronic transitions between the HOMO and LUMO and are associated
with charge transfer (CT). Other higher-energy bands near 351 and
347 nm for SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR are
due to the π–π* electronic transitions, respectively.
Both of the molecules show very high molar extinction coefficients
of about 2 × 105 M–1 cm–1 in solution. A perusal of the solid-state electronic absorption
spectra reveals that both of the molecules exhibit red-shifted and
broadened spectral features compared to the solution state. This red
shift of λmax in the solid-state along with the spectral
broadening is attributed to molecular aggregation due to enhanced
intermolecular π–π interactions. Molecular aggregation
is a commonly observed phenomenon in the π-extended planer molecular
systems, and depending on the nature of molecules, there is formation
of H-aggregation (blue-shifted) and J-aggregation33,34 (red-shifted). It is very important to note that spectral broadening
in the solid state extends toward the higher wavelength region compared
to that in the solution state. This indicates the possibility of the
development of J-aggregates in the solid state by molecular stacking.
At the same time, thin-film absorption spectrum of the SQ-BEN-FUR appeared slightly red-shifted than SQ-BEN-THI, indicating
the stronger molecular stacking compared to SQ-BEN-THI. This could be attributed to the presence of more electronegative
O-atom of benzofuran ring of SQ-BEN-FUR compared to that
of S-atom of benzothiophene in SQ-BEN-THI.

(Fc/Fc+) has been considered to be +0.63 V vs normal hydrogen
electrode (NHE).

Fluorescence
emission spectra of both the molecules in DCM solution,
as shown in Figure 2b, exhibited emission maximum λmax(em) at 692 and
696 nm for SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR, respectively.
Difference between λmax for electronic absorption
and fluorescence emission spectrum is known as Stokes shift, which
is considered to be originated from the energy losses due to vibrational
relaxation, conformational changes, or molecular reorganization. It
can be seen from the Table 1 that both of the molecules exhibit very small Stokes shift
of only 20–22 nm, which suggests the molecular rigidity and
conformational stability of the molecules in both the excited and
ground states.35 Optical band gap (Eg) is an important parameter especially of organic
semiconductors and has been widely employed for the construction of
energy band diagrams. Actually, the LUMO energy level for organic
semiconductors has been determined by adding the energy corresponding
to Eg to the HOMO energy level. Eg has been widely estimated from the absorption
edge of the electronic absorption spectrum, which is good for the
materials having a sharp and clear spectral onset. On the other hand,
in many polymeric semiconductors where absorption spectrum is broad,
determining the onset is prone to the errors. Intersection of absorption
and emission spectrum has been defined as Eo–o and widely used to estimate Eg and LUMO,
which has been used and shown in Table 1 for both the newly designed molecules.36

Electrochemical Characterization
Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) has been widely used for the electrochemical characterizations
pertaining to the determination of HOMO/LUMO and electrochemical band
gap of organic semiconductors. CV was conducted for both molecules
in DCM solution, and the three-electrode electrochemical cell consisted
of platinum wire/coil as the counter electrode/working electrode and
saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The
tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M) and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple is used as an external standard. Cyclic voltammogram
for both dye molecules SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR, as shown in Figure 3, exhibited two reversible oxidation waves, and the potential for
the first oxidation wave was used for the estimation of HOMO energy
level. After running the CV for standard Fc/Fc+ redox couple,
CV for the dyes was recoded under similar conditions and potentials
were rescaled with respect to the Fc/Fc+ reference. Considering
the well-accepted redox potential of Fc/Fc+ to be at +0.63
V versus NHE (−5.07 eV vs vacuum), the HOMO energy level was
calculated from the first oxidation wave.37 The value of this HOMO energy level estimated by CV for respective
dye molecules was used to calculate the LUMO energy level by adding Eg (discussed in Section 3.1) and the calculated
results are presented in Table 1.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammogram for dye molecules SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR recorded in DCM solution.

Quantum Chemical Calculations
Molecular orbital (MO)
calculations have been widely adopted for designing novel functional
molecules to predict their energetics and electronic absorption spectra
before performing the experiments to save experimental time. The geometries
of SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR dyes in isolated
gaseous state were optimized by using (6-311G) basis set and linear
spin density approximation (LSDA) exchange correlation function in
Gaussian 09 programs.38 The optimized geometry,
HOMO and LUMO energy levels, with electronic distribution is represented
in Figure 4. The electron
cloud in HOMO for both the dye molecules is mainly centralized at
the central squaric acid core and slightly extended to the π-framework
attached near to the core of the dye molecules.

Figure 4 Computational result
of the optimized structure and electron density
distribution in HOMO and LUMO of the newly designed squaraine dyes
utilized in this work.

However, the LUMO energy level is concerned with π*
MO and
the electron density is present over the squaric acid core and neighboring
indole units along with a slight decrease of electron density at squaric
acid core, indicating the possibility of intramolecular charge transfer
upon photoexcitation. Energetics of the photofunctional molecules
plays a dominant role for their utilization toward the optoelectronic
application. Energy of HOMO calculated using 6-311G/LSDA predicts
the HOMO energy values of −5.05 and −5.02 eV for both SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR, respectively, which
are in very good agreement with their respective experimental values
determined from the CV and presented in Table 1. Considering the experimental values of
HOMO of −5.12 and −5.11 eV (Table 1) for SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR along with most commonly used value for work function of −5.10
eV for Au, it seems that Au can function as an Ohmic contact (source–drain
(S–D)) material for fabricating electronic devices like field-effect
transistors.39

To better understand
the electronic transition, oscillator strength
and molar extinction coefficients of both the dyes, the time-dependent
density functional theory (TD-DFT) method was performed using similar
exchange correlation functional and basis set in Gaussian 09 programs
after optimization of geometry. Figure 5 represents the calculated vertical excitation energies
from the ground state to the lowest singlet excited states and theoretical
electronic absorption. Theoretical absorption spectra show the intense
band centered at 659 and 661 nm having oscillator strengths of 2.055
and 2.050 for SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR,
respectively, mainly attributed to the π–π* electronic
transition from the HOMO–LUMO energy level. A perusal of this
calculated λmax of about 660 nm for both the squaraine
dyes reveals that calculated λmax is slightly hypsochromically
shifted in comparison to experimental values (about 672 and 674 nm)
as shown in Table 1. This very small difference (12–14 nm (about 0.01 eV)) between
the experimentally observed values λmax and theoretical
calculation ones indicates that this is the potentiality methodology
for the theoretical calculation of absorption spectra.

and SQ-BEN-FUR (b) using TD-DFT under 6-311G/LSDA in
isolated gaseous state.

Electrical Characterization
Results pertaining to the HOMO energy values for both the newly designed symmetrical squaraine
dye molecules obtained by combined theoretical and experimental approaches
and optical Eg, as shown in Table 1, indicate that these molecules
may behave as moderate-band-gap organic semiconductors. To explore
this possibility, electrical characterization experiments were performed
by fabricating the OFETs in the bottom gate top contact device architecture
and utilizing both these dyes as organic semiconductor. Schematic
representation of the device architecture used in this work is shown
in the Figure 6a.

and output characteristics for OFETs utilizing (b) SQ-BEN-THI and (c) SQ-BEN-FUR as active semiconducting material.

Results obtained from the I–V characteristics
of the OFETs based on both SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR are shown in Figure 6b,c. It can be clearly seen that both the OFETs operate after application
of negative gate bias reflecting p-type charge-transport behavior
with relatively larger output current observed in the case of OFETs
based on SQ-BEN-FUR. Transfer characteristics of the
fabricated OFETs based on both the dye molecules are shown in Figure 7a,b. Device parameters
such as field-effect mobility (μ), on/off ratio, and threshold
voltage (Vth) were extracted from the
transfer curves in the saturation regime of the transfer properties
using eq 1 along with
summarization of the extracted results in Table 2. 1  Field-effect mobilities
of 4.0 × 10–5 and 5.4 × 10–5 cm2/(V s) were found to be for the SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR molecules, respectively. This slightly
higher observed
mobility for the OFET-based on SQ-BEN-FUR has been confirmed
for multiple devices using this dye molecule. As can be seen from Figure 7, annealing the films
for 10 min led to a slight increase in the charge-carrier mobility;
however, there was no significant trend observed for the on/off ratio
of the OFETs.

Conclusions
Synthesis and photophysical characterizations for two novel and
near-infrared sensitive small molecules, namely, SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR, with D–A–D molecular
structure consisting of squaraine as central unit, benzothiophene,
and benzofuran as end groups have been reported. Photophysical, electrochemical,
and quantum chemical calculation results were combined to describe
the structural, optical, and electronic properties of two newly designed
squaraine dyes. Electrical characterization has been made using these
molecules as active organic semiconductor after FET fabrication in
bottom gate top contact device architecture. OFETs thus fabricated
showed field-effect mobilities of 4.0 × 10–5 and 5.4 × 10–5 cm2/(V s) for SQ-BEN-THI and SQ-BEN-FUR, respectively. After
thermal annealing at 130 °C, the field-effect mobility slightly
increased up to 7.4 × 10–5 cm2/(V
s) for SQ-BEN-FUR and 5.0 × 10–5 for SQ-BEN-THI. We have systematically studied the
effect of heteroatom (oxygen and sulfur) substitution on the optical,
electrochemical, and electrical properties. Considering all of the
results, we assume that more efforts to design and synthesize new
squaraine-based p-type semiconductors are extremely pivotal to further
pursue their scope as carriers and structure–property connectivity.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Method
All starting materials, benzo[b]thien-2-ylboronic acid, 2-benzofuranylboronic acid, iododecane,
and squaric acid, were purchased from Alfa-Aesar, Aldrich. Final synthesized
dyes were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution
mass spectroscopy (HRMS) for structural verification. 1H (400, 300, and 500 MHz) and 13C (150 MHz) NMR spectra
were recorded using Avance-400, AMX2-500, and Avance ACP-300 NMR spectrometers;
tetramethylsilane (TMS) is used as an internal standard. HRMS images
were obtained on a Shimadzu LCMS-2010 EV model equipped with an ESI
probe. Absorption spectra in dichloromethane (DCM) solution and solid
state (spin-coated thin film on glass) were recorded on a UV–visible–NIR
spectrophotometer (model and make). Fluorescence emission spectra
of dyes were recorded in DCM solution using a fluorescence spectrometer
(model and make). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) for electrochemical characterization
was conducted on a CH Instruments three-electrode system consisting
of Pt working electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode, counter electrodes.
CV of the dyes was performed in DCM solution containing 2 mM respective
dyes and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate electrolyte at a scan
rate of 100 mV s–1. Optimized geometries of final
dyes along with the HOMO, LUMO, and absorption spectra were calculated
using TD-DFT without any symmetry restriction using linear spin density
approximation as optimized functional for squaraine dyes and 6-311G
basis set as executed in Gaussian 09 program package.40−42

Synthetic Procedure
Newly designed symmetrical squaraine
dyes with molecular structure displayed in Figure 1 were synthesized by Pd-assisted Suzuki cross-coupling
between the dye intermediate (Z)-4-((5-bromo-1-decyl-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indol-1-ium-2-yl)methylene)-2-((E)-(5-bromo-1-decyl-3,3-dimethylindolin-2-ylidene)methyl)-3-oxocyclobut-1-enolate

mixture and degassed for about 15 min. The reaction was carried out
at 60 °C for 15 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent was
removed under vacuum and then the residue was taken up with dichloromethane
(DCM) and washed with water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous

Device Fabrication
A highly p-doped
silicon possessing
300 nm of SiO2 as gate dielectric insulator with a gate
capacitance (Ci) of 10 nF/cm2 was used for fabricating OFETs. A 2% (w/w) solution of both of the
dyes was prepared in dehydrated chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) and spin-coated
on SiO2 at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Annealing was performed under
argon atmosphere at 130 °C for 10 min prior to electrode deposition.
Gold (Au) was utilized for source (S) and drain (D) electrodes and
thermally deposited on the spin-coated dye layer having a thickness
of 50 nm at a base pressure of 10–6 Torr using Nickel
shadow mask. Channel length (L) and width (W) of the mask were 20 μm and 2 mm, respectively.
All OTFTs were electrically isolated prior to the characterization
by removing the semiconductor film around the device by cotton bud
dipped in chloroform. Drain current–drain voltage (IDS–VDS) as
well as the drain current gate voltage (IDS–VGS) characteristics were measured
using a computer-controlled two-channel electrometer (Keithley 2612).
Device parameters were extracted from the transfer curves.
