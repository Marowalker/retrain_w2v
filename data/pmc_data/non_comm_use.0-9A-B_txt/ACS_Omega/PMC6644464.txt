Herein,
we report the role of surface oxygen vacancies and lanthanide
contraction phenomenon on HS– anion adsorption and
desorption in the sulfide-mediated photoelectrochemical water splitting
of Ln(OH)3 (Ln = La, Pr, and Nd). The Ln(OH)3 were synthesized via a solvothermal route using ethylenediamine
as the solvent. The surface defects are characterized by Raman, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses.
The photoelectrochemical water-splitting behavior of Ln(OH)3 enriched with surface oxygen vacancies has been examined in a 1
M Na2S solution under illumination conditions. La(OH)3 exhibited a highly stable and saturated current density of
∼26 mA/cm2 at 0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Similarly, the
hydroxides of Pr and Nd demonstrated current densities of 18 and 14
mA/cm2, respectively, at 0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl). A reduction
trend in the saturated current densities from La to Nd indicates the
lanthanide contraction phenomenon, where the basicity decreases in
the same order. The results also demonstrate that the surface adsorption
of the HS– anion in the active sites of the surface
oxygen vacancies played a vital role in enhancing the photoelectrochemical
water-splitting behavior of Ln(OH)3. The stability of Ln(OH)3 was examined after 4 h of chronoamperometry studies at 0.8
V (vs Ag/AgCl) and analyzed using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
infrared, Raman, and EPR and XPS analyses. The results show that the
Ln(OH)3 exhibited excellent stability by demonstrating
their phase purity after photoelectrochemical water splitting. We
propose Ln(OH)3 as highly stable photoelectrochemical water-splitting
catalysts in highly concentrated sulfide-based electrolytes and anticipate
Ln(OH)3 systems to be explored in a major scale for the
production of H2 as an ecofriendly process.

Introduction
The utilization of
solar energy (1.3 × 105 TW irradiates
on the surface of earth) as an ecofriendly and renewable energy source
to address the global warming issues is considered as an important
field in the recent research and development across the world.1−3 The discovery of visible light-driven photochemical and electrochemical
processes to produce hydrogen as a clean fuel is one of the promising
routes to hinder the utilization of fossil fuels. In this regard,
in 1972, Fujishima and Honda developed the TiO2 catalyst
and demonstrated the photoelectrochemical water-splitting process
as a highly efficient direction to produce hydrogen from water,4 and since then much research has been focused
on developing photoactive semiconductor-based catalysts. Recently,
rare-earth hydroxides Ln(OH)3 are attracting greater interest
because of their unique electronic configuration in 4f shells, and
owing to this advantage, rare-earth hydroxides are being explored
as sensors,5 capacitors,6 catalysts,7 and sorbents.8 To highlight, Wang et al.9 demonstrated an enhanced photocatalytic degradation of Congo red
dye using Ln (Ln = Sm, Er, Gd, Dy, and Eu)-doped La(OH)3 in the presence of lattice defects which influenced the electron–hole
separation. In addition to this, Dong et al.10 articulated that the surface oxygen vacancies in La(OH)3 drive excellent photocatalytic activity in NO removal because of
the extended ultraviolet (UV) light capture. Though the surface oxygen
vacancies in Ln(OH)3 are extensively studied,10 the use of rare-earth hydroxides as catalysts
in photoelectrochemical water splitting is extremely sparse.

In this work, we have synthesized the rare-earth hydroxides of
lanthanum (La), praseodymium (Pr), and neodymium (Nd) by a simple
solvothermal method using ethylenediamine (ED) as the solvent and
explored them as photoelectrocatalysts in 1 M Na2S electrolyte.
The results demonstrated that the Ln(OH)3 systems exhibited
highly stable and saturated photocurrent densities because of the
presence of surface oxygen vacancies, as active sites, for the surface
adsorption of HS– anion, and promoted the extensive
hole (h+) utilization and subsequently enhanced the hydrogen
generation under illumination in the sulfide-based electrolytes. Our
results also reveal the surface adsorption of the HS– anion is more significant than that of the OH– anion in an enhanced photoelectrochemical water-splitting activity
of Ln(OH)3. The chronoamperometry tests of Ln(OH)3 demonstrated the highly stable and saturated photocurrent densities
for a period of 4 h. We have also carried out a 12 h chronoamperometry
test for La(OH)3 and verified the stability issues in the
long run. The photocurrent densities that tend to decrease from La
to Nd reveal the lanthanide contraction phenomenon, where the basicity
decreases in the same order. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Raman,
and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results before and after the
photoelectrochemical tests demonstrated the excellent stability of
the Ln(OH)3 systems. Our results pave the pathway of stable
and prolonged activity for the Ln(OH)3 systems and can
be anticipated on a large-scale photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation.
This would be the first report on Ln(OH)3 in photoelectrochemical
water splitting.

Results and Discussion
X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The crystallinity and phase
purity of the synthesized La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3,
and Nd(OH)3 were analyzed using XRD (Figure 1a). The XRD spectrum for La(OH)3 exhibits the planes (100), (101), (200), (201), (300), (112), (311),
(302), and (410) at 2θ of 15.66°, 27.97°, 31.62°,
39.47°, 48.26°, 55.26°, 64.02°, 69.70°, and
77.27°, respectively.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray powder diffraction patterns for La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3; (b) variation
of lattice parameter
“a” from La to Nd hydroxides; and (c)
variation in the crystallite size from La to Nd hydroxides.

The planes indicate the high purity
and crystallinity of La(OH)3. The broadened peaks elucidate
the “nano” structure
of La(OH)3 particles. All the reflected planes are well-matched
with the standard JCPDS file no. 36-1481 (a = b = 6.528 Å and c = 3.858 Å),
which demonstrates a hexagonal phase for La(OH)3 with the P63/m space group. The XRD spectrum
for Pr(OH)3, exhibited the planes (100), (101), (201),
(211), and (220), at 2θ of 15.9°, 28.7°, 40.44°,
49.56°, and 56.37°, respectively, indicating high crystallinity
and high phase purity. The obtained planes are well-matched with the
standard JCPDS file no. 45-0086 (a = b = 6.524 Å and c = 3.780 Å) and demonstrates
a hexagonal phase for Pr(OH)3 with the P63/m space group. Further, the XRD spectrum
for Nd(OH)3 exhibited the planes (100), (101), (200), (201),
(211), (220), (131), (302), and (410) at 2θ of 16.66°,
28.87°, 32.27°, 40.47°, 49.77°, 57.14°, 65.58°,
71.73°, and 78.77°, respectively, indicating high crystallinity
and high phase purity. These patterns are well-matched with the standard
JCPDS file no. 70-0215 (a = b =
6.422 Å and c = 3.742 Å) and demonstrates
a hexagonal phase for Nd(OH)3 which also belongs to the P63/m space group.

The
lattice parameter “a” is decreased
from La to Nd because of the lanthanide contraction phenomenon (shrinking
of the unit cell volume) (Figure 1b). As the ionic size of the lanthanides in Ln3+ decreases from La to Nd, the covalent character of Ln-(OH)3 increases and hence the basicity decreases.11 Thus, La(OH)3 is more basic, whereas Nd(OH)3 is less basic. The addition of electrons in the 4f shell
increases the nuclear charge and the outer electrons become constricted
(changes in the crystallite size, Figure 1c). The broadness or the full width at half-maximum
of the planes for Ln(OH)3 decreased from La to Nd, which
is again also realized from the lanthanide contraction phenomenon.12

High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy
Analysis
Figure 2 illustrates
the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images
of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3,
giving insight into the morphology, lattice fringes, and the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. Figure 2a represents the La(OH)3 nanoparticles
(NPs) and elucidates the uniform size distribution in the range of
5–20 nm in diameter, which were derived from the solvothermal
synthesis. The nanosize nature of particles is also supported from
the broadness of the XRD pattern for La(OH)3. Figure 2b depicts the fast
Fourier transform (FFT) patterns for the La(OH)3 NPs and
elucidates clear lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.318
and 0.228 nm that correspond to the (101) and (201) planes of the
hexagonal system with the P63/m space group, respectively. The SAED pattern of the La(OH)3 system is depicted in Figure 2c and reveals the polycrystallinity. The indexed circles
(bright spot array) represent the (101), (201), and (102) planes,
which are consistent with the XRD patterns of La(OH)3.
Further, Figure 2d
represents the morphology of the Pr(OH)3 particles, and
it is observed that the formation of NPs in the size range of 10–40
nm is achieved via solvothermal synthesis. Figure 2e demonstrates the lattice fringes of the
Pr(OH)3 NPs with interplanar distances of 0.314 and 0.225
nm. The corresponding SAED patterns shown in Figure 2e and the indexed planes of (101), (201),
and (211) correspond to the hexagonal phase of Pr(OH)3 with
the P63/m space group
with polycrystallinity. Likewise, the morphology of Nd(OH)3 is shown in Figure 2g. Interestingly, Nd(OH)3 demonstrates the one-dimensional
nanorod formation with the size in the range of 100–300 nm
in length and 30–50 nm in width. Figure 2h represents the lattice fringes of the Nd(OH)3 nanorods with interplanar distances of 0.310 and 0.223 nm.
The corresponding SAED patterns are shown in Figure 2i, with the indexed planes of (100), (101),
and (201) that correspond to the hexagonal phase of Nd(OH)3 with the P63/m space
group. The size of the rare-earth hydroxides is increased from La(OH)3 to Nd(OH)3 because of the nature of the rare-earth
elements, chemical potential of the reaction solution, and the capping
agents. However, in the presence of surfactants or capping agents,
the growth mechanism can be varied. In the current work, ED acts as
both a surfactant and a capping agent.13 As a basic solvent, it triggers the controlled oxidation of the
rare-earth nitrate salt into hydroxides. By covering the surface of
the nanocrystals as a layer, ED further prevents the inward diffusion
of the elements, thus restricting the grain growth. The change in
the size from La to Nd hydroxides may be due to the amount of ED covering,
which is based on the positive charge of the crystallites. As the
covalent nature of Ln-(OH)3 increases from La to Nd, the
electrostatic forces between Ln-(OH)3 and ED will be suppressed,
driving the lower ionic radii containing element “Nd”
to grow anisotropically. In most of the studies,10,14 Ln-(OH)3 synthesized without surfactants and templates
reveals that the anisotropic growth is mainly directed by the inherent
nature of the rare-earth elements and the chemical potential of the
reaction solution.14 Here, the surface
morphologies of La, Pr, and Nd hydroxides are found to be dissimilar
in comparison with the reported literature, which is attributed to
the role of the surfactant and the covalent nature of Ln-(OH)3.

UV–Vis Analysis
Figure 3 represents
the UV–visible diffuse
reflectance spectra (UV-DRS) of the powdered samples of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3. La(OH)3 shows the absorption band at 275 nm (Figure 3a), which can be assigned to the intrinsic
band absorption, and further, the broad absorption in the range of
280–350 nm elucidates the surface oxygen vacancies.10 The direct band gap of La(OH)3 is
calculated and found to be 4.5 eV. Similarly, the absorption spectra
of Pr(OH)315 illustrate well-defined
and sharp absorption bands at 450, 475, 488, and 595/600 nm. The first
three bands are called blue bands and are attributed to the absorption
from the ground-state term (3H4) to 3P2, 1l6 + 3P1, and 3P0. A red band is observed at 595/600
nm because of the transition from the ground-state term (3H4) to 1D2 and 1G4. This band appeared because of the water molecules attached
to the Pr3+ ion.16 Further,
in the case of Nd(OH)3, we have noticed well-defined bands
at 358 nm in the UV region and at 430, 470, 524, and 578 nm in the
visible region, attributed to the absorption from the ground-state
term (4I9/2) to 2H11/2, 2G9/2, 4G7/2 + 4G9/2 + 2K13/2, and 4G5/2 + 2G7/2, respectively. The
absorption bands beyond 600 nm, found at 682, 746, 800, and 872 nm,
are due to the absorption from 4I9/2 to the 4F9/2, 4F7/2 + 4S3/2, 4F5/2 + 2H9/2, and 4F3/2 transitions of Nd3+ ions, respectively.16,17

Nd(OH)3.

Photoluminescence Analysis
Figure 4 represents
the emission bands ranging from
400 to 500 nm because of the crystal defects arising from the 4f to
O 2p bands of the rare-earth metals.18 According
to the literature, surface oxygen vacancies play a vital role in creating
trap-state emissions which enhance the photoluminescence of the rare-earth
hydroxides.19 The room-temperature emission
photoluminescence spectra of the hydroxides of La, Pr, and Nd powders
with an excitation wavelength at 230 nm are reported in Figure 4. Because of the vacant f-orbital
in La(OH)3, the La3+ ionic center is not regarded
as an emission center and does not emit light from the inner 4f atomic
orbital. The oxygen vacancies that exist in the La(OH)3 lattice act as the trap states for photoinduced electrons. A strong
blue-emission band is observed at 469 nm and other small bands appear
because of the trap-state emission from a deep-level charge transfer
of the La(OH)3 crystal lattice.19 The photoluminescence (PL) spectra
of Pr(OH)3 demonstrated peaks at 434, 464, and 482 nm.
These bands are obtained from the f–f transitions of the ground-state 3H4 absorption to the next higher orbital (3H4 → 3P2, 3H4 → 3P1, and 3H4 → 3P0).20 The PL spectra of Nd(OH)3 show peaks at 428,
451, and 469 nm. The blue band is obtained at around 469 nm from the 4D3/2 → 4I15/2 or 2P3/2 → 4I13/2 transition.21 The bands at 425 and 451 nm are obtained from
the 2P1/2 → 4I9/2 and 4G11/2 → 4I9/2 transitions, respectively.22 The UV-DRS
and PL spectra of Ln(OH)3 indicate that the synthesized
compounds do possess the surface defects and oxygen vacancies. These
observations are further analyzed by EPR.

(c) Nd(OH)3.

EPR Analysis
The EPR analysis was employed to detect
the nature of defect on the La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 systems. The EPR experiments were conducted
at 100 K. The EPR spectra of the rare-earth hydroxides of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 are reported
in Figure 5a. The rare-earth
hydroxides exhibited a dominant signal with a g factor
of 2.02788, 2.01488, and 2.0006 for La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3, respectively. The demonstrated g values are not equal to the free-electron g-value, 2.0023.23 As reported recently
by Kakazey et al., the g value for the oxygen vacancies
was found to be ∼2.003 because of the chemisorbed O2–.24 To highlight, Zhu
et al.25 acquired a dominant EPR signal
at a g factor of ∼2.0190 for the surface oxygen
vacancies in ZnO. Likewise, Jing et al.26 demonstrate that the O2– (oxygen vacancies) gave
signals at g ≈ 2.0106 and is confirmed in
the ZnO crystals. On the basis of these reported works, the elucidated g factors for La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and
Nd(OH)3 clearly authenticated the presence of the surface
oxygen vacancies. Figure 5b shows that the surface oxygen vacancies are more for La(OH)3 than that for Pr and Nd hydroxides. These oxygen vacancies
can serve as photoinduced charge traps10 (as observed from the UV and PL studies) and can be anticipated
to demonstrate the enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity of the
rare-earth hydroxides of the La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 crystals.

Figure 5 (a) EPR spectra of La(OH)3,
Pr(OH)3, and
Nd(OH)3; (b) g factor value variation
from La(OH)3 to Nd(OH)3; and (c) EPR signal
intensity variation from La(OH)3 to Nd(OH)3.

The intensity of signals decreased
from La(OH)3 to Nd(OH)3, elucidating the decrease
in the surface oxygen vacancies
(Figure 5c). The formation
of oxygen vacancies depends on the conditions favorable for the crystal
growth of these rare-earth hydroxides. As discussed earlier, the surfactant
ED suppresses the OH bonding with the rare-earth metal node. As the
covalent nature of Ln(OH)3 increases from La to Nd, the
role of the surfactant on Nd(OH)3 will decrease. Further,
the presence of oxygen vacancies is confirmed by the HR-TEM images
of these rare-earth hydroxides of the La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 crystals and is represented in Figure 6. Figure 6 clearly indicates the formation
of surface defects in the HR-TEM images on the surfaces of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3, and similar
lattice defects were also reported by Dong et al. in an earlier work.10 In Ln(OH)3, along with the surface
oxygen vacancies, defects such as edge dislocations and screw dislocations
are observed.

Raman Spectra
The Raman spectra of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 obtained with an excitation
wavelength of 360 nm are depicted in Figure 7. By the factor group analysis on the space
group P63/m, the hexagonal
Ln(OH)3 structures are realized as the irreducible representations
of the Raman-active vibrations A1g, E2g, and
E1g.27 The Raman-active modes
E2g and A1g are obtained from the anion translation
behavior, whereas the Raman-active mode E1g is due to liberation
mode of −OH dipole.27 The Raman
spectrum of La(OH)3 that reveals the bands at 282, 340,
and 451 cm–1 corresponding to the irreducible representations
of A1g, E2g, and E1g clearly indicates
the Raman-active modes of La(OH)3,28 as reported by Hoang et al., Similarly, the Raman bands obtained
at 292, 354, and 466 cm–1 corresponding to the irreducible
representations of A1g, E2g, and E1g designate the Raman-active modes of Pr(OH)3.29 Further, the Raman bands observed at 294, 365,
and 472 cm–1 corresponding to the irreducible representations
A1g, E2g, and E1g signify the Raman-active
modes of Nd(OH)3.30

Figure 7 Raman spectra
of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3.

These Raman-active modes (A1g, E2g, and E1g) are found to shift
to a higher wavenumber from La to Nd,
which specifies the decrease in the cation to anion distance or, in
other words, Ln to OH distance, also known as the lanthanide contraction
phenomenon. However, a sharp band at around 3601 cm–1 has been identified for all Ln(OH)3 and can be assigned
to the surface OH groups.31 In addition
to this, this band also demonstrates the crystal defects and impurities.32 As the covalent nature increases from La to
Nd, it is anticipated that more OH groups attach to Nd (see the discussion
in the TEM analysis for size variation and surface oxygen vacancies).
In contrast, the relative intensities of the Raman vibration modes
at around 3601 cm–1 reveal the reduction from La
to Nd, and based on this observation, the vibration mode may be attributed
to the surface defects, rather than the surface OH group alone. This
trend indirectly demonstrates that the surface defects are more for
La(OH)3 and less for Nd(OH)3.

XPS Analysis
The chemical speciation of the rare-earth
hydroxides (Ln(OH)3) is examined by XPS. The full survey
of the La(OH)3 electrodes shows the presence of La, O,
C, F, and Sn elements (Figure S1a). The
elements F and Sn are acquired from the base fluorine-doped tin oxide
(FTO) plate. The photoelectron spectra of La 3d and O 1s were recorded
and depicted correspondingly in Figure 8a,b. Typically, the La 3d spectrum exhibits multiplet
split for the binding energies of the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 regions with four Gaussian components. The peaks at 834
and 851 eV are attributed to the corresponding two spin–orbits
of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, and the same is also authenticated
from the reported literature.33−35 Further, the peaks at 837 and
854 eV can be attributed to the satellite peaks of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin–orbits, respectively. As stated
by Mullica et al.,35 the electronic state
configurations of [3d9]hole 4f0[L]
(a core hole) and [3d9]hole 4f1[L]hole (a core hole with an electron transferred from L’s
valence band to an empty 4f orbital) (L stands for the oxygen ligand)
are responsible for the spin–orbits in La(OH)3,
where f0 and f1 are acquired at low and high
binding energies, respectively.36−39 The binding energy separation (ΔE) between f1 and f0 is found to be 3.9 eV,
and ratio of f0/f1 is more than 1, which confirms
the La3+ state of La(OH)3 and matches well with
the earlier reports.33,35

Figure 8 XPS (a) 3d spectra of La(OH)3, (b) O 1s spectrum of
La(OH)3, (c) 3d spectra of Pr(OH)3, (d) O 1s
spectrum of Pr(OH)3, (e) 3d spectra of Nd(OH)3, and (f) O 1s spectrum of the Nd(OH)3 electrodes.

The La 4p spectrum (Figure S1b) also
reveals the La(OH)3 system based on the main peak (195.3
eV) and the satellite peak (199.3 eV) positions.33 The O 1s spectrum demonstrated a fine deconvolution with
the two peaks. The peak at 530.1 eV is designated to the metallic
oxygen (La–O) and the other peak at a higher binding energy
of 532.1 eV can be assigned to the hydroxyl group.33,40−42 Similarly, XPS analysis is also carried out on the
Pr(OH)3 electrode, and the full survey is presented in Figure S2. The full survey of the Pr(OH)3 electrodes shows the presence of the Pr, O, C, F, and Sn
elements. The elements F and Sn are acquired from the base FTO conducting
glass plate. The photoelectron spectra of Pr 3d and O 1s were recorded
and depicted in Figure 8c,d. The Pr 3d spectrum shows two prominent peaks at 934 and 954
eV, which can be designated to the spin–orbits of Pr 3d5/2 and Pr 3d3/2, respectively, with a separation
of 20 eV. The shoulder peaks at 928 and 949 eV are attributed to the
well-screened [3d9] 4f3 satellite peaks. The
main peaks and satellite peaks indicate the trivalent Pr in the Pr(OH)3 system and is well-matched with the earlier reports.15,43−45Figure 8d represents the O 1s spectrum of Pr(OH)3 that is deconvoluted
into two peaks at 529.5 and 531.6 eV, which correspond to the oxygen
with Pr (Pr–O) and the oxygen in the hydroxyl groups, respectively.

Further, XPS analysis was also carried out on the Nd(OH)3 electrode, and the full survey is illustrated in Figure S3. The full survey of the Nd(OH)3 electrodes
shows the presence of the elements Nd, O, C, F, and Sn. The elements
F and Sn are acquired from the base FTO conducting glass plate. The
photoelectron spectra of Nd 3d and O 1s were recorded and depicted
in Figure 8e,f. The
O KLL auger electron signals appear in the same range with Nd 3d and
approximated with the clean KLL signals of La(OH)3 and
Pr(OH)3 and subtracted by constructing the average oxygen
KLL spectrum. In the photoelectron spectrum of Nd 3d, two prominent
peaks are observed at 982 and 1006 eV, which are attributed to the
spin–orbits of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 with the
[Nd4+ (3d5/2)1 4f3, 9OH–] final state I distribution46 and state II distribution for satellite peaks [Nd3+ (3d5/2)1 4f3, 9OH– –
e–].47Figure 8f represents the
O 1s spectrum of Nd(OH)3 that is deconvoluted into three
peaks at 529.5, 531.5, and
534.2 eV, which correspond to the oxygen with Nd (Nd–O), the
oxygen in the hydroxyl groups, and that in carbonate (CO32–), respectively. An extra deconvoluted peak is
obtained at 534.2 eV, which may be because of the consumption of CO2 by the surface rare-earth hydroxides. The molar ratios of
O 1s/Ln 3d were found to be less than 3, which indicate the oxygen
vacancies in all the three compounds.

Photoelectrochemical Studies
Photoelectrochemical tests
were conducted in a typical three-electrode system, in which platinum
electrode was used as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference
electrode, and the rare-earth Ln(OH)3 coated on FTO served
as a working electrode. All these tests were conducted in 1 M Na2S solution as a sacrificial electrolyte, under the light illumination
of 100 mW/cm2. Figure 9a represents the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves
of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3,
demonstrating the current densities of 19.5, 17, and 14 mA/cm2, respectively, at 0.8 V (Ag/AgCl) with a scan rate of 5 mV/s. Figure 9b represents the
photoactivities of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 which were found to be 2, 1.5, and 1.0 mA/cm2 at
0.8 V (Ag/AgCl), respectively. Figure 9c represents the chronoamperometry of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 for a period of 4 h.

(c) chronoamperometry studies for a period of 4 h, and (d) amount
of hydrogen evolution for the duration of 4 h for each electrode.

The La(OH)3 electrode
shows a saturated photocurrent
density of 26.5 mA/cm2, and this saturation in current
density was obtained after 1.3 h of the chronoamperometry test. The
gradual increase in the current density of La(OH)3 clearly
indicates that the surface reactions might take place on the electrode,
which are time-dependent. This is due to the sluggish adsorption kinetics
of the anionic species HO– and HS– present in the electrolyte and to the desorption of the SO42– species, as mentioned in the mechanism (eqs 1–14). In case of Pr(OH)3 and Nd(OH)3, the saturation photocurrent densities of
17.5 and 14 mA/cm2 are obtained in an early stage of 0.5
h of chronoamperometry. In case of La(OH)3, we have noticed
a 2-fold increase in the photocurrent density when compared with Nd(OH)3. This is due to the fact that the basicity of La(OH)3 is more and reactivity is high when compared with the other
rare-earths hydroxides. Figure 9d indicates a pictorial representation of the hydrogen evolution
diagram of La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3 for a period of 4 h.

The La(OH)3 photoelectrode
exhibited 1.1 mmol for 4
h, whereas Pr(OH)3 and Nd(OH)3 photoelectrodes
exhibited 0.5 and 0.38 mmol, respectively. As mentioned above, the
reduction in the basicity from La to Nd would decrease the activity.
The adsorption and desorption processes on the rare-earth electrodes
in the Na2S electrolyte played a vital role, where the
sulfide ions are electrochemically very active components that are
adsorbed on the anode surface and donate electrons to undergo oxidation
to produce sulfate as the end product. The mechanism48−50 for hydrogen production in a sulfide medium involves various reactions
as described below.

By the absorption
of photons from light, the catalyst produces
electron–hole pairs. Because of the presence of the oxygen
vacancies on the surface of the photoanode, the electrons trapped
on those catalytic sites and the Na2S sacrificial electrolyte
consume the photogenerated holes and reduces the recombination of
the electron–hole pairs. The surface adsorption of the sulfide,
bisulfide, and hydroxyl ions is greatly influenced by the surface
oxygen vacancies, which provide space for the adsorption sites. The
sulfide and bisulfide species are very active species compared with
the hydroxyl ions and thus greatly enhance the photoelectrochemical
activity. As shown in eq 8, the sulfide ions are converted into sulfate ions directly or indirectly
through a number of intermediate products such as polysulfides, sulfites
and thiosulfates.51 Thus, the ultimate formation of
sulfate ions taken place and go back to the electrolytic solution
through the process of desorption. The bisulfide ions, as shown in eq 9, act as hole scavengers,
which are responsible for the higher photocatalytic activity of the
Na2S solution. Thus, the formed oxygen is consumed by the
Na2S sacrificial electrolyte and eventually converted into
hydroxide ions (eq 12) and finally converted into sulfate ions. The photogenerated electrons
are consumed by the hydrogen ions and are converted into hydrogen
gas at the cathode.

The long-term chronoamperometry study of
the La(OH)3 electrode is depicted in Figure 10. The chronoamperometry studies
of the La(OH)3 electrode reveal the stability of the photoanode
for a 12 h period.
We have obtained a stable current density of 26 mA/cm2,
which indicates the stability of the rare-earth hydroxides in the
case of photoelectrochemical water splitting. In the photoelectrochemical
studies of these rare-earth hydroxides in other electrolytes like
KOH and Na2SO4, the electrodes exhibited a poor
performance (0.45 mA/cm2 at 0.8 V Ag/AgCl) (Figure S4). In the KOH electrolyte, the surface
adsorption and desorption of OH– are not realized
as the major contributing reactions for enhanced water splitting.
Also, from the photoelectrochemical studies of the Na2SO4 electrolytes (Figure S5), it is
understood that the concentration of HS– is important
for enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting, and the HS– concentration is higher in Na2S than in
the Na2SO4 electrolyte.

of the La(OH)3 electrode in
1 M Na2S electrolyte for the period of 12 h.

After the photoelectrochemical water-splitting
tests, we have performed
a series of characterizations on the Ln(OH)3 electrodes
using XRD, FTIR, Raman, and XPS analyses to demonstrate the extended
stability in the sulfide media. XPS is employed on the surface of
the electrodes to discover the changes in the chemical potentials
of the rare-earth hydroxides. The full surveys of the Ln(OH)3 electrodes after the test are presented in Figures S1–S3. The La(OH)3 electrode exhibited the
presence of extra elements of Na and S when compared before and after
the test and is deconvoluted, as shown in Figure S6. The La 3d spectrum
reveals a good match with the condition before the test and confirms
that the La3+ state corresponds to that of La(OH)3. The two spin–orbit peaks at 834 and 851 eV and the satellite
peaks at 837 and 854 eV of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 exactly
fit with the condition before the test. This observation affirms that
the chemical potential of the La(OH)3 system has not been
altered. Further, the O 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into two peaks,
which are assigned to the metallic oxygen at 530.1 eV and the hydroxyl
groups at 532.1 eV. Interestingly, the ratio of the peak areas of
the metallic oxygen to the hydroxyl group is found to be lower than
that before the test condition, which indicates that the surface is
enriched with more hydroxyl groups, attributed to the surface adsorption
of the OH– species in the oxygen vacancy sites on
the electrode during the photoelectrochemical water splitting. The
scans were also extended to the Na 1s and S 2p regions. The XPS spectrum
of Na 1s is presented in Figure S6c and
is deconvoluted into a single peak at 1071.6 eV, which indicates that
Na+ is in the form of either sulfate or polysulfide.52 This observation is further supported by the
S 2p spectrum (Figure S6d), which demonstrated
two doublet peaks at 161.7 and 163.3 eV and another peak at a higher
binding energy of 171.1 eV. As per the literature,52 the peak at 161.7 eV is assigned to the terminal polysulfide
and the peak at 163.3 eV is assigned to the central polysulfide. The
peak at the higher binding energy of 171.1 eV is assigned to the sulfates.
Though the central polysulfides exhibit a peak at 160.8 eV for the
Na2S salts reported by Sartz et al.53 in 1971, in the recent work, the peak at the binding energy
of 163.3 eV is assigned to the central polysulfides,52 and the same is followed in this work. From these observations, it is confirmed that Na is chemically
bound with S and forms sodium sulfide and sodium sulfate. These results
also confirm that sulfides and sulfates are formed over the electrode
during photoelectrochemical water splitting.51

Further, the Pr(OH)3 electrode also exhibited the
presence
of extra elements of Na and S when compared before and after the test
and is deconvoluted, as presented in Figure S7. The Pr 3d spectrum divulges a perfect match with the condition
before the test and confirms the Pr3+ state corresponds
to Pr(OH)3. The two spin–orbit peaks at 934 and
954 eV and the satellite peaks at 928 and 949 eV of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 exactly fit with the same peaks with before
condition.
This observation asserts that the chemical potential of the Pr(OH)3 system has not been altered after the photoelectrochemical
water-splitting test. The O 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into two peaks
which correspond to the metallic oxygen at 530.1 eV and the hydroxyl
groups at 532.1 eV. The XPS spectrum for Na 1s (Figure S7c) is deconvoluted into a single peak at 1071.6 eV
and indicates that Na+ is in the form of either sulfates
or polysulfides.52 Again, this observation
is further supported by the S 2p spectrum (Figure S7d), which demonstrated two doublet peaks at 161.7 and 163.3
eV and another peak at a higher binding energy of 171.1 eV. As per
the literature,52 the peak at 161.7 eV
is assigned to the terminal polysulfide and the peak at 163.3 eV is
assigned to the central polysulfides. The peak at the higher binding
energy of 171.1 eV is assigned to the sulfates. From these observations,
it is confirmed that Na is chemically bound with S and forms sodium
sulfide and sodium sulfate. These results also confirm that sulfides
are adsorbed and sulfates are formed over the electrode during photoelectrochemical
water splitting.51

Similarly, the
Nd(OH)3 electrode also exhibited the
presence of extra elements of Na and S, and the Nd 3d spectrum notifies
a perfect match with the condition before the test (Figure S8), confirming the Nd3+ state corresponds
to Nd(OH)3. This observation declares that the chemical
potential of the Nd(OH)3 system has not been altered. The
O 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into three peaks which correspond to
the metallic oxygen at 530.1 eV, the hydroxyl groups at 532.1 eV,
and the carbonate at 534.2 eV. The XPS spectrum of Na 1s (Figure S8c) is deconvoluted into a single peak
at 1071.6 eV and indicates that Na+ is in the form of either
sulfates or polysulfides.52 The S 2p spectrum
demonstrated two doublet peaks at 161.7 and 163.3 eV and another peak
at a higher binding energy of 171.1 eV. Again, based on the literature,52 the peak at 161.7 eV is assigned to the terminal
polysulfide and that at 163.3 eV is assigned to the central polysulfides.
The peak at the higher binding energy of 171.1 eV is assigned to the
sulfates.

For all the three electrodes of the rare-earth hydroxides,
before
the test, the ratio of O/Ln was found to be lower than 3, which indicates
the existence of surface oxygen vacancies on the electrodes. After
the test, the ratio of O/Ln was found to more than 3, which further
reveals the extra hydroxylation that induced more surface-adsorbed
OH groups over the surface of the electrodes. Interestingly, the sulfate
formation over the electrodes is decreased from La to Nd hydroxides
during the 4 h photoelectrochemical tests. Similarly, the central
and terminal polysulfides also follow the same trend from La to Nd
hydroxides. The sulfate and polysulfide formation rate depends on
the photoelectrochemical activity; as a higher activity is attained
for the La(OH)3 electrodes, the formation of sulfate and
polysulfides is higher in the La(OH)3 electrodes than that
in the other electrodes. These observations are further supported
by the FTIR analysis before and after the tests of the rare-earth
hydroxide electrodes.

The FTIR analysis is carried out on Ln(OH)3 after long-term
photoelectrochemical tests and is reported in Figure S9. La(OH)3 shows the bands at 649, 1388,
1496, 3425, and 3612 cm–1 before the test (Figure S9a). The vibration mode at 649 cm–1 is attributed to the characteristic La–O–H
bending vibrations; the vibrations at 1388 and 1496 cm–1 are due to the N–H stretching of the amine group of the ED
surfactant; and that at 3425 cm–1 is attributed
to the O–H vibrations of the surface-adsorbed water molecules.54 The vibration at 3612 cm–1 is attained as a result of the O–H tension in the hydroxyl
group. Interestingly, after the test, La(OH)3 shows the
presence of extra vibrations at 1002 and 1136 cm–1 along with the vibrations that were present before the test. The
vibration bands at 1002 and 1136 cm–1 are the characteristic
peaks of the inorganic ions and indicate the resonance interaction
attributed to the polysulfides and sulfates.55,56 To highlight, Moraes et al.56 describes
that the vibration mode around 1150 cm–1 is due
to the adsorbed SO42–, and this observation
is further supported by Peak et al.57 Further,
the intensity of the vibration mode at 3425 cm–1 increased when compared before and after the test, which indicates
the extra OH surface adsorption during photoelectrochemical water
splitting.

Similarly, Pr(OH)3 shows the bands at
665, 1382, 1506,
3427, and 3608 cm–1 before the test (Figure S9b). The vibration mode at 665 cm–1 is attributed to the Pr–O–H bending
vibrations;15 the 1382 and 1506 cm–1 vibrations are due to the N–H stretch of the
amine group of the ED surfactant; and that at 3427 cm–1 is attributed to the O–H vibrations of the surface-adsorbed
water molecules.54 The vibration at 3608
cm–1 is attained as a result of the O–H tension
in the adsorbed hydroxyl group. Interestingly, after the test, Pr(OH)3 shows the presence of extra vibrations at 1002 and 1132 cm–1 along with the other vibrations that were present
before the test. The vibration bands at 1002 and 1132 cm–1 are the characteristic peaks of inorganic ions and indicate the
resonance interaction attributed to the polysulfides and sulfates.55,56 The intensity of the vibration mode at 3427 cm–1 increased when compared before and after the test, which indicates
the OH surface adsorption during photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Further, Nd(OH)3 shows the bands at 675, 1390, 1514,
3425, and 3608 cm–1 before the test (Figure S9c). The vibration mode at 675 cm–1 is attributed to the Nd–O–H bending
vibrations;58 the 1382 and 1506 cm–1 vibrations are due to the N–H stretch of the
amine group of the ED surfactant; and the 3425 cm–1 vibration is attributed to the O–H vibrations of the surface-adsorbed
water molecules.54 The vibration at 3608
cm–1 is attained as a result of the O–H tension
in the adsorbed hydroxyl group. Interestingly, after the test, Nd(OH)3 shows the presence of extra vibrations at 1004 and 1136 cm–1 along with the other vibrations that were present
before the test. The vibration bands at 1004 and 1136 cm–1 are the characteristic peaks of the inorganic ions and indicate
the resonance interaction attributed to the polysulfides and sulfates.55,56 The intensity of the vibration mode at 3425 cm–1 increased when compared before and after the test, which indicates
the OH surface adsorption during photoelectrochemical water splitting.
The Ln–O–H stretching is found to shift to a higher
frequency from La to Nd hydroxides because of the increase in the
covalent bonding nature (before the test condition) and reveals the
lanthanide contraction phenomenon, which is also supported by Raman
spectroscopy.

The Raman spectroscopy results of the electrodes
after the tests
are presented in Figure S10. The Raman
spectrum of La(OH)3 reveals the bands at 273, 334, and
456 cm–1, corresponding to the irreducible representations
of the A1g, E2g, and E1g active modes.
Similarly, the Raman bands are obtained at 281, 349, and 452 cm–1 corresponding to the A1g, E2g, and E1g modes of Pr(OH)3. Further, the Raman
bands observed at 287, 354, and 453 cm–1 corresponding
to the A1g, E2g, and E1g signifies
the Raman-active modes of Nd(OH)3. These Raman-active modes
(A1g, E2g, and E1g) are found to
shift to a higher wavenumber from La to Nd, which specifies the decrease
in the cation to anion distance or, in other words, Ln to OH distance,
also known as the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. In addition to
this, a sharp band at around 3601 cm–1 has been
identified in all Ln(OH)3 and can be assigned to the surface
OH groups31 and surface defects.32 In contrast, for each rare-earth hydroxide,
compared before and after tests, the respective values for A1g, E2g, and E1g were found to shift to a lower
wavenumber, which might be due to the extra adsorbed OH group-induced
relaxation in the electrostatic forces between the cation and anion
in the unit cell. Further, the vibration peak at around 3601 cm–1 does not exhibit an appreciable change when compared
before and after the tests for all the rare-earth hydroxide electrodes.
However, these vibration mode peak intensities are decreased for all
hydroxides when compared with those before the tests. The reduction
percentages are found to be 93.4, 80.9, and 26.4 for La(OH)3, Pr(OH)3, and Nd(OH)3, respectively. This
could be explained based on the reduction of the surface defects because
of the adsorption of the anionic species over the surfaces of the
electrodes. According to the photoelectrochemical water-splitting
studies, SH– would be the rate-limiting anionic
species than OH– in Na2S solutions.48 As the SH– anionic species
is more active, according to eq 8, the oxidation reaction forms X–SO42– (as Na2SO4) on the surface.
At higher photoelectrochemical current densities, the formation rate
is higher over the electrodes, and hence the XPS results demonstrated
a higher quantity of sulfides and sulfates on the La(OH)3 surface, which decreased gradually to Nd(OH)3. The EPR
analyses on the after-test rare-earth hydroxide materials reveal the
reduction in the intensities (Figure S11) and confirm the reduction in the surface defects by the strong
adsorption of OH– ions, which is supported by XPS,
Raman, and FTIR. Even though the XRD results (Figure S12) before and after the photoelectrochemical water-splitting
tests did not reveal any of the sulfate-based compounds, indicating
the negligible quantity for identification, it is strongly demonstrated
that Ln(OH)3 remains in the same phase and purity (Figure S12). From this, it can be concluded
that the rare-earth hydroxides have a strong stability in the Na2S electrolyte; adsorption and desorption are realized as the
major mechanisms; and surface defects play a vital role in enhancing
the photoelectrochemical water-splitting behavior of Ln(OH)3.

On the basis of these
findings, this work eradicates the ambiguity
of the rare-earth hydroxides in the solar water-splitting application
as photoelectrocatalysts. As the other catalysts can degrade or exhibit
photocorrosion in high alkaline mediums, the proposed rare-earth hydroxides
stand first in elucidating their stability in the long run and pave
the pathway for their application in solar water splitting.

Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated Ln(OH)3 as efficient
and stable catalysts in sulfide-mediated photoelectrochemical water
splitting and also provided clear insights into the role of the surface
oxygen vacancies and lanthanide contraction phenomenon for rare-earth
hydroxides in solar water splitting. The excellent stability demonstrated
for the La(OH)3 electrode for 12 h duration elucidates
the immensity of Ln(OH)3. We propose Ln(OH)3 as highly stable photoelectrochemical water-splitting catalysts
in highly concentrated sulfide-based electrolytes and anticipate the
Ln(OH)3 systems to be explored in a major scale for the
production of hydrogen.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Ln(OH)3
One gram of rare-earth
nitrates (La, Pr, and Nd) are added to 30 mL of ED under stirring
and transferred to 50 mL of autoclave and kept in a hot air oven at
180 °C for 8 h. Then, the autoclave is cooled to room temperature,
and the precipitate is washed several times with ethanol–water
by centrifugation and dried in vacuum at 65 °C.

Preparation
of Photoanode
The Ln(OH)3 powders
of 3 mg each were mixed with 5–6 μL of Nafion and 50
μL ethanol solution until it becomes a paste. For conductivity
purpose, 0.15 mg of graphite powder is added to the above paste and
ground well. Then, the paste is applied as a thin layer on a PEDOT:PSS
(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate)-coated FTO
glass in a 1 cm2 area, dried, and used in photoelectrochemical
studies.

Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting
The photoelectrochemical
water-splitting activities of Ln(OH)3 were recorded using
a typical three-electrode potentiostat system (Autolab, PGSTAT 302N,
Metrohm, model: AUT 83515 and Nova 1.8 software) where a Pt counter
electrode was used as the cathode, Ag/AgCl was the reference electrode,
and a photocatalyst material-coated FTO plate was used as the photoanode
(with 1 cm2 exposure area). The exposure area of the photoanode
was illuminated with a solar-simulated light source with a power intensity
of 100 mW/cm2 generated from a 300 W Xe lamp. The LSVs
were recorded between −0.8 and 0.8 V potential with a scan
rate of 5 mV/s. The nitrogen gas was bubbled in the 1 M Na2S (pH = 13) electrolyte to remove the dissolved oxygen effect in
photoelectrochemical studies.
