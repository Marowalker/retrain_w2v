Telmisartan (TLM),
a nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist, is widely
prescribed for treating arterial hypertension and marketed by the
innovator with the trade name of Micardis and Micardis plus. Telmisartan
exhibits low aqueous solubility in the pH range of 3–7, which
is the physiological pH. For addressing the issue of poor solubility
of TLM, its commercial form makes use of inorganic alkalinizers. The
present work illustrates the attempt to improve the solubility of
telmisartan via a crystal engineering approach. A novel solid form
of telmisartan with phthalic acid was obtained through the solution
crystallization method (TPS) and the reaction crystallization method
(TPR). Both the forms (TPS and TPR) were thoroughly characterized
by powder diffraction X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry,
thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
and 1H NMR and were identified to be two different crystalline
forms. Solubility studies of TPS and TPR were conducted at varying
pH of phosphate buffer, and they exhibited 11-fold and 22-fold increased solubility, respectively,
when compared to that of the pure drug at pH 5, which is within the
pH of small intestine at which telmisartan is best absorbed orally
from the systemic circulation.

Introduction
With the rise in the
number of poorly soluble drugs in the pipeline
and market place, manipulating aqueous solubility of these drugs has
become a crucial step in preformulation research. Physicochemical
properties of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), such as solubility,
dissolution, bioavailability, stability, etc., are directed by the
arrangement of molecules in its three-dimensional crystal lattice.1,2 Thus, a variation in the structural arrangement of an API in its
solid state through noncovalent interactions will aid in the development
of an ideal crystal form with desired properties, and, at the same
time, the intrinsic biological activity will be retained. Through
exploitation of the crystal engineering technique, it has been possible
to anticipate probable intermolecular interactions and design new
solid forms with desired properties.3,4 This in turn
has spurred the growth and development of multicomponent solid forms
such as salt,5,6 cocrystals,7−9 etc. and proved
to be a promising approach to address issues such as poor solubility,10−12 dissolution,13 bioavailability,14 stability,15,16 mechanical
properties,17,18 etc.

In this regard, we
aimed to investigate the applicability of the
crystal engineering technique and explore a novel solid form of a
poorly soluble drug, telmisartan (TLM). Telmisartan (TLM, Figure 1), chemically referred
to as 2-[4-[[4-methyl-6-(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)-2-propylbenzimidazol-1-yl]methyl]phenyl]benzoic
acid, is a nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist, prescribed for the
treatment of arterial hypertension.19 TLM
exists in three crystalline forms, two polymorphs and one pseudopolymorph.20 The aqueous solubility of TLM is strongly pH-dependent.
The maximum solubility was observed at extremely low and high pH.
TLM is practically insoluble at pH 3–7 (0.09 μg/mL in
water), which is the physiological pH.19 This poor solubility becomes a major hurdle in the bioavailability
of TLM, which is only 42–58%. Nonetheless, TLM is commercially
available and marketed by the innovator under the trade name of Micardis
and Micardis plus. To resolve the issue of pH-dependent solubility
of TLM, the marketed formulations make use of strong alkalinizers
such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, meglumine, or combination
thereof as pH modulators.21 The inorganic
alkalinizers increase the microenvironmental pH for achieving the
optimum solubility required for absorption. However, this leads to
disruption and degeneration of duodenal and jejunal mucosal tissues.22 Apart from the solubility issues, telmisartan
is rapidly absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.23 However, the maximum absorption is found to
be in the small intestine where the intraluminal pH is within the
range of 5–7.23,24 Therefore, the aim of our study
is to improve the aqueous solubility of telmisartan within the pH
range of small intestine (pH 5–7) to achieve the best possible
oral absorption without using any alkalinizers. In comparison with
formulation approaches for improving the solubility of telmisartan,25−28 the investigations through the crystal engineering approach are
less and limited to only four reports in the literature.29−32 Hence, there is a need to limit the use of inorganic alkalinizers
and find a suitable crystal form of TLM that can address its poor
aqueous solubility and may be an alternative to the existing dosage
form.

CH2 in color and phthalic acid (PA) used in this study.

In this article, we describe the
screening studies for a new solid
form of telmisartan, isolation and preparation of novel multicomponent
solid forms (TPS and TPR) of telmisartan with phthalic acid (PA, Figure 1), and their comprehensive
characterization by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), 1H
NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) followed
by solubility measurements at various pH.

Results and Discussion
The structure of TLM possesses one acidic and two basic functionalities,
or, in other words, it offers one hydrogen bond donor and two acceptor
sites. Thus, it is expected to form hydrogen bonds with certain coformers
that are having acid or amide functional groups. For modulating pH-dependent
solubility, pKa of the coformers was also
taken into consideration. Therefore, in this study, a series of coformers
containing carboxylic group and amide group with varying pKa values were selected for the screening purpose
(Table S1, Supporting Information) by employing
the solution crystallization method. A novel multicomponent solid
form of telmisartan with phthalic acid was obtained by the solution
crystallization method (TPS), which was further prepared by the reaction
crystallization method (TPR). The obtained forms (TPS and TPR) were
characterized through various analytical techniques.

Powder X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The PXRD pattern with new diffraction
peaks and absence of characteristic peaks of the individual components
confirms that a new crystalline form is produced as the peaks are
representatives of reflections of each atomic plane.33 The characteristic peak of TLM appeared at 2θ values
of 6.8, 14.18, 20.10, and 22.19, and phthalic acid showed the characteristic
reflection at 15.44, 18.62, and 26.92. The PXRD pattern of TPS and
TPR compared with the starting material, telmisartan (TLM) and phthalic
acid (PA), is presented in Figure 2. The PXRD pattern revealed that the characteristic
peaks of the drug and coformer were absent in it. New diffraction
peaks at 2θ values of 4.9, 12.76, 17.04, 22.62, 25.3, 28.02,
and 28.72 were observed in TPS. In TPR, unique diffraction peaks were
present at 2θ values of 13.12, 13.98, 17.04, 20.66, 23.94, 25.32,
28.32, and 28.72. The characteristic peaks of telmisartan and phthalic
acid shifted, and the appearance of new peaks in TPS and TPR confirmed
the formation of a new crystalline phase. The literature suggests
that various methods used for the synthesis of cocrystals do not lead
to the production of the same cocrystal form or composition.34 Chow et al. suggested that accelerated crystallization
by rapid solvent removal often yields a metastable solid, as speculated
by Ostwald’s rule of successive stages.34 In this case too, the obtained TPS and TPR possess different
cocrystalline forms owing to their different synthesis methods. The
difference in the PXRD pattern, thermal behavior, and solubility studies
of TPR and TPS proved the same.

Figure 2 Powder X-ray diffractograms of TPS and
TPR compared with those
of starting materials.

Calculation of Stoichiometric Proportion in TPS and TPR
Solution 1H NMR was used to identify and confirm the chemical
components and the stoichiometry in the new crystalline phase.35,36 The resulting 1H NMR spectrum of the TPS and TPR cocrystal
systems comprises the peaks from TLM, PA, and ethanol. It is evident
from NMR that the acidic protons from the carboxylic group of TPS
and TPR are in downfield at 13.35 ppm (Figure S1) and 13.26 ppm (Figure S4), respectively,
which confirms H-bonded acidic protons and voids any proton transfer.
This study further confirms the existence of a solvated cocrystal for
both TPS and TPR. Both the D2O exchange spectra of TPS
(Figure S1) and TPR (Figure S5) show the disappearance of the peaks corresponding to acidic protons.
The peak assignment from 1H NMR data confirms the distinguished
peak of two CH2, as shown in blue and red (Figure 1) at δ 2.90 (t, 2H) and
δ 5.54 (s, 2H), respectively, for TLM in the TPS cocrystal system.
A total of 14 aromatic protons (ArHs) appear as multiples in the region
of δ 7.14–7.57. Furthermore, phthalic acid has 4 ArHs as multiplets
in the region of δ 7.64–7.69, which merge with aromatic
protons of TLM. The relative integration of distinguished CH2 (red as in Figure 1) of TLM at δ 5.54 shows integration of 2H and 18H found in the aromatic
region. Thus, quantitative integration (Figure S2) confirms the 1:1 ratio of TLM (14 ArHs) and PA (4 ArHs)
in the TPS cocrystal system. Similar results were obtained for the
TPR cocrystal system, which confirmed the 1:1 ratio of TLM (14 ArHs) and PA (4 ArHs) in
this system. In another quantitative integration study from 1H NMR spectrum of TPS cocrystal system showing distinguished CH2 peak of TLM (blue δ: 2.90, t, 2H) with 1 integration
in comparison to 0.5 integration for CH2 proton of ethanol
(δ: 3.35–3.40). Thus, the presence of half ratio of ethanol in comparison
to unit ratio of TLM confirms the presence of TLM/ethanol in 1:0.5
ratio (Figure S3) in TPS cocrystal. Thus,
overall, the ratio of TLM, PA, and ethanol was stoichiometrically
confirmed as 1:1:0.5 in the TPS cocrystal system. Similar quantitative
integration studies were conducted to identify the stoichiometric
proportion of TLM, PA, and ethanol in the TPR cocrystal system, and it was found
to be 1:1:0.3, as shown in Figure S5.

It is interesting to note that the presence of TLM, PA, and ethanol
was further confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD)
analysis. The asymmetric unit comprises TLM, PA, and ethanol in the
TPS cocrystal, as shown in the Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Plot (ORTEP)
diagram with 30% probability displacement ellipsoids (Figure 3).37 The single-crystal parameters of TPS are mentioned in the foot note
of Figure 3.

Thermal Analysis
The distinct melting points of TPS
and TPR from those of TLM (270.24 °C) and PA (209.94 °C)
suggested the formation of a new crystalline phase. However, TPS and
TPR exhibited an unfamiliar thermal behavior (Figures 4A and 5A). Desolvation
of the ethanol molecule occurred in TPS and TPR at 124 and 156 °C,
respectively, indicating the different binding energy of ethanol in
TPS and TPR. Melting of desolvated TPS and TPR was observed at 199.8
°C, heat of fusion (ΔHf) =
136.40 J/g, and at 200.53 °C, ΔHf = 157.66 J/g, respectively. Upon desolvation, TPS and TPR converted
into the same form, similar to the phenomenon observed in the telmisartan–saccharine
cocrystal.29 The melting of desolvated
TPS and TPR was found to be accompanied by decomposition of PA (endothermic
event) and subsequent recrystallization (exothermic event) of TLM.
The recrystallization peak of TLM does not appear in any of the DSC
thermogram due to partial cancellation of the exothermic and endothermic
events occurring simultaneously.38,39 Surprisingly,
the endothermic melting peak of recrystallized TLM did not appear
in TPR. A DSC experiment was conducted to unveil the reason behind
the phenomenon. After melting of the desolvated TPR form, it was isothermally
held at 200 °C for 1 h and then cooled to 30 °C to ensure
complete recrystallization of TLM from the melt. The endothermic peak
of recrystallized TLM appeared in the second heating cycle and is
presented in Figure 6.

Figure 5 (A) DSC thermogram of TPR and (B) TGA curve of TPR.

Figure 6 DSC thermogram of TPR (heating–cooling
cycle).

On analyzing the TGA profile of
TPS and TPR (Figures 4B and 5B), there was
a weight loss of 26.13 and 26.38% in the temperature range of 144.44–215.84
and 146–238 °C, respectively. The weight loss in TPS corroborates
with the theoretical weight loss of 27.16% for the loss of 0.5 mol
of ethanol and 1 mol of phthalic acid from the crystal lattice. In
the same manner, the weight loss in TPR corroborates with the theoretical
weight loss of 25.90% for the loss of 0.3 mol of ethanol and 1 mol
of phthalic acid from the crystal lattice. This suggests that stoichiometry
of TLM/PA/EtOH in TPS and TPR is 1:1:0.5 and 1:1:0.3, respectively,
and this also corroborates with the stoichiometry established from 1H NMR analysis.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can be used as a reliable technique
to detect the formation of the multicomponent crystal. The FTIR spectra
of telmisartan, phthalic acid, TPS, and TPR are shown in Figure 7, and relevant bands
are presented in Table 1. Carboxylic acid (COOH) absorbs strongly at 1700 cm–1 for the C=O stretching band and a weaker C–O stretch
around 1200 cm–1, whereas the carboxylate group
(COO−) exhibits two characteristic coupled carbonyl absorption
band at 1550–1650 cm–1 (asymmetric) and around
1400 cm–1 (symmetric).6,12,39,40 The carbonyl stretches
of carboxylic acid of TLM were observed at 1697 cm–1, which is not affected and appeared at 1693 cm–1 in TPS and TPR. Furthermore, one of the C=O stretches of
PA was also merged within 1693 cm–1. The second
C=O stretch of PA appeared at 1585 cm–1,
which downshifted to 1573 and 1566 cm–1 in TPS and
TPR, respectively, due to the formation of H-bonding in the cocrystal
system. The identification of C–N stretching is rather difficult
because the mixing of bands is possible in this region. Hence, the
FTIR bands at 1303 and 1381 cm–1 have been attributed
to the C–N stretching in TLM, which is observed at 1369 and
1361 cm–1 for TPS and TPR, respectively.

TPR in Their FTIR Spectra

O–H stretching vibrations	3059	3691, 3008	3336, 3055, 3032	3329, 3059, 3032	
The appearance of an additional OH stretching vibration at 3032
cm–1 in TPS and TPR implies the presence of ethanol
in the crystal lattice. The ethanol molecule possibly interacts only
with C=O of PA, as there in no change in the C=O stretch
of TLM. Thus, the FTIR spectra corroborate with 1H NMR
and SCXRD, confirming that the new solid form (TPS, TPR) is a solvated
cocrystal.

pH-Dependent Solubility Studies
The pH-dependent solubility
of telmisartan is attributed to its three pKa values 3.5, 4.1, and 6.0 corresponding to its carboxylic
(acidic) and two benzimidazole (basic) functional groups, respectively.19,41,42 At acidic pH, the N of benzimidazole
of TLM gets ionized, forming a cationic center, and at basic pH, the
carboxylic group of TLM is ionized, forming an anionic center, which
is responsible for its maximum solubility at extremely high and low
pH. Even though TLM exhibits a good solubility profile at extremely
high and low pH, it exhibits low solubility in the pH range of 3–7,
i.e., in the physiological pH range. When the cocrystal gets dissolved
in aqueous solvent, both the drug and coformer ionize in aqueous solvent;
therefore, the solution pH is an important factor in determining its
solubility as well as stability. It is important to determine the
thermodynamic stability with respect to pH for understanding the transformation
of the multicomponent form of telmisartan to its free form. This result
will help us achieve the desired dissolution rate and bioavailability
over a wide pH range. Thus, the solubility measurement of TPS and
TPR was carried out at various pH values in phosphate buffer.

In Figure 8, solubility–pH
profiles of telmisartan, TPS, and TPR have been presented. A “U”-shaped
solubility–pH profile was obtained for telmisartan due to its
amphoteric nature. The ionizing nature of the coformer imparted modification
in the solubility–pH profile of telmisartan and increased its
solubility at a lower pH. The solubilities of TPS and TPR have been
greatly enhanced by 11-fold and 22-fold at solution pH 5, thereby
showing its pH dependency, which can be visualized in Figure 9. The systemic absorption of
TLM is found to be highest in small intestine where the pH lies in
the range of 5–7.23,43 Thereby, enhanced solubility
of telmisartan at its best site of systemic absorption has been achieved
through its cocrystalline form.

Figure 8 Solubility of TPS, TPR, and TLM at varying
pHs (3–10).

Figure 9 Solubility comparison
of TPS, TPR, and TLM at varying pHs (3–10).

Due to the acidic nature of the coformer, the solution
pH was found
to be decreased. Therefore, the equilibrium pH was noted upon completion
of the solubility experiment and is presented in Table S2, Supporting Information.

Determination of pHmax
Another important
aspect in the solubility–pH profile of an ionizable drug (acidic/basic/amphoteric)
is the determination of pHmax. pHmax aids in
understanding the stability of the new solid form with respect to
pH and subsequently its in vivo and in vitro performance.44 pHmax is referred to as the intersection
point of two independent curves, where one curve represents the drug
as the saturating or equilibrium species and the other curve represents
the salt as the equilibrium species.45 The
same concept holds for determining the pHmax of the cocrystal.
From Figure 8, pHmax of TPS and TPR can be observed at just below pH 8.

Theoretically, when pH is below pHmax, the cocrystal is
the saturation species; above that, the saturation species is the
free base/drug; and pHmax is the pH where both the phases
coexist. For analyzing this, the residual solids collected from the
solubility study of TPS and TPR at different pH were characterized
by PXRD and is shown in Figures 10 and 11. The diffraction peaks
corresponding to the TPS cocrystal, i.e., at 9.82, 13.96, 19.6, and
20.16, were almost retained in all residual samples collected from
the solubility study within the pH of 3–7. Moreover, the diffraction
peaks corresponding to the TPR cocrystal at 2θ, 13.63, 17.01,
and 20.63, were almost retained in all residual samples collected
from the solubility study within the pH of 3–7. In between
pHs 6 and 7, for TPS and TPR, both cocrystals and telmisartan were
found to be present in the residual solid, confirmed by the appearance
of characteristic peaks of telmisartan at 2θ 6.78 and 14.18°
in the PXRD diffractogram along with the peaks of TPS and TPR. This
may be concluded that the pHmax for TPS and TPR lies around
pH 7. When pH is above the pHmax, the saturated species
would be free base, telmisartan. The appearance of characteristic
peaks of telmisartan and disappearance of the characteristic peak
of TPS and TPR from the PXRD diffractogram from pH 8 (which is above
pHmax) onwards confirmed that the saturation species is
telmisartan. Therefore, the PXRD result corroborated well with the
concept of pHmax in the case of the cocrystal of basic
drugs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this work demonstrates the
finding of a novel solid
form of telmisartan through the crystal engineering approach. Of several
coformers used for screening, phthalic acid formed a new multicomponent
solid phase with telmisartan. The new multicomponent solid forms were
prepared by two methods, namely, the solution crystallization method
(TPS) and reaction crystallization method (TPR). Both the forms were
characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), 1H NMR,
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analyses
(TGA), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). TPS and
TPR were found to be a solvated cocrystal of telmisartan. The objective
of this work of enhancing the solubility of telmisartan within the
physiological range was achieved. TPS and TPR markedly increased the
solubility of telmisartan by 11-fold and 22-fold at pH 5, the pH at
which telmisartan gets absorbed from systemic circulation. The experimental
solubility result suggests the selection of coformer to be a crucial
step and its pKa to modulate the physicochemical
properties of an amphoteric API. Thus, by the cocrystallization technique
it is possible to improve the pH-dependent solubility of telmisartan,
which may eliminate the use of inorganic alkalinizers in its marketed
dosage form.

Experimental Section
Materials
Polymorph
A of telmisartan (TLM, 99.7% pure)
was obtained as a gift sample from Unichem Laboratories Ltd. (Himachal
Pradesh, India). Phthalic acid was procured from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals
and was used without any further purification. The solvents (chloroform,
ethanol) used for crystallization were of high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) grade (Rankem, India).

Synthesis of the New Solid
Form by the Solution Crystallization
Method (TPS)
Equimolar quantity of telmisartan (25 mg, 0.0485
mmol) and phthalic acid (8.05 mg, 0.0485 mmol) was ground in a mortar
and pestle for 10 min and the ground mixture was dissolved in 6–7
mL of chloroform:ethanol (2:1 v/v) and allowed to evaporate at room
temperature. After 6–7 days, single crystals of suitable size
for XRD analysis were obtained. The formation of a new solid phase
was preliminarily confirmed by PXRD and then analyzed by DSC, TGA,
FTIR, 1H NMR, and SCXRD.

Synthesis of the New Solid
form by the Reaction Crystallization
Method (TPR)
A saturated solution of telmisartan was prepared
in chloroform and ethanol (1:1 v/v). To it, phthalic acid was added
in an amount under its solubility limit. The solid precipitate was
collected and initially confirmed by PXRD. It was then further analyzed
by DSC, TGA, FTIR, and 1H NMR.

Characterization
of the New Solid Form
Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)
PXRD patterns were
collected on a Rigaku Smart Lab diffractometer system with a 1.5406
Ǻ radiation wavelength. The tube voltage and current were
set at 45 kV and 200 mA, respectively. Each sample was placed in an
aluminum sample holder and measured by a continuous scan between 3
and 40° in 2θ with a step size of 0.02°/min at room
temperature and with a scan speed of 5°/min using a semiconductor
detector. The experimental PXRD patterns were refined using Smart
Lab Guidance software.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
1H NMR analysis
of TPS and TPR was performed on a 400 MHz JEOL NMR spectrometer using
DMSO-d6 as a solvent at 25 °C. The
D2O exchange experiment was conducted to identify the chemical
shift of acidic protons. Stoichiometry of TPS and TPR cocrystal systems
was estimated using relative integration of the distinguished −CH2 peak (Figure 1) of TLM in comparison to distinguished protons of phthalic acid
and ethanol.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Analysis
of TPS
X-ray
diffraction data were recorded on a SuperNova Eos diffractometer using
monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data
collection was performed at room temperature (293 K) for the samples
studied. Olex2 was used to solve the structure using ShelXS and refined
with the ShelXL refinement package using least-squares minimization.
The observed disordered atoms C17 (C17A and C17B) and C18 (C18A and
C18B) from the propyl side chain of TLM were refined using Olex2 and
are shown in the ORTEP diagram (Figure 3). All of the nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically,
and the hydrogen atoms were placed on the basis of the mixed mode
through Fourier difference maps and geometrical assignment.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC of all
samples was conducted using a DSC 4000 instrument (PerkinElmer). Samples
(3–5 mg) were crimped in nonhermetic aluminum pans and scanned
from 30 to 300 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a
continuously purged dry nitrogen atmosphere at a constant flow rate
(20 mL/min). The data were processed using Pyris manager software.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA was performed
on a TGA 4000 (PerkinElmer) instrument. The samples (5–8 mg)
were placed into a ceramic pan and heated from 30 to 700 °C at
a rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen purge at a flow rate of 20
mL/min. The data were managed by Pyris manager software.

Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The
infrared spectra of the drug, coformer, and salts were recorded individually
by a FTIR-8400S spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) using the potassium
bromide (KBr) pellet method. The IR absorption spectra of samples
with 50 scans were measured over the range of 4000–500 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1 for
each sample. The data were analyzed using IR solution software.

Solubility Measurement
All solubility measurements
were carried out in phosphate buffer at 25 °C. pH was adjusted
with potassium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. Aliquots (0.2 mL)
were withdrawn at 72 and 96 h (for ensuring equilibrium conditions)
and filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (AXIVA). The concentrations
of telmisartan and phthalic acid were analyzed by an HPLC system (Waters
TM 486, tunable absorbance detector) equipped with a UV/Vis detector.
A C18 Nova-Pak column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) at ambient temperature
with a flow rate of 1 mL/min was used to separate telmisartan and
phthalic acid. An isocratic method with methanol and phosphate buffer
(10 mM) mixed in a ratio of 72:28 (v/v) was opted for quantitative
determination of telmisartan and phthalic acid at an optimum wavelength
of 296 nm. Sample injection was 20 μL. EMPOWER software was
used for collection and processing the data. The concentrations of
telmisartan and phthalic acid were calculated using the standard curve
(linearity range 2–16 μg/mL for both the analytes), which
was prepared in a mobile phase. The samples were diluted by methanol
prior to analysis. The experiments were conducted in triplicate and
were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
