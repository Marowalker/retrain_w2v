Recently, there is
an increase in interest to develop user-friendly
monitoring devices in healthcare, environmental, and agrofood fields
for a fast detection of contaminants. Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group
of toxic substances produced by the fungi of species Aspergillus that contaminate cereals and dried fruits. When dairy cows ingest
feed contaminated with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), it is metabolized and
transformed in the liver into a carcinogenic form aflatoxin M1 (AFM1),
which is eliminated through the milk. In this work, we developed a
sensor assay to detect low amounts of AFM1 directly in whole milk.
For this purpose, we produced monospecific polyclonal antibody (IgGMS-M1)
that was able to bind with high avidity to AFM1. Then, we conjugated
the antibody to the invertase enzyme from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. This enzyme is able to convert sucrose
into fructose and glucose. After incubation of invertase-conjugated
anti-AFM1 antibody with milk containing AFM1, we measured the produced
glucose by a glucometer. The produced glucose was then correlated
to the amount of AFM1 present in the milk. The obtained results show
that the assay is easily customizable as a portable instrument for
on-site AFM1 measurements. In addition, the results point out that
the assay is very sensitive since it can detect the presence of 27
parts per trillion (ppt) of AFM1 in whole milk, a value lower than
the AFM1 quantities in milk and dairy products set by the European
Commission (50 ppt).

==== Body
1 Introduction
Recently, researchers
have shown an increased interest in developing
user-friendly devices to monitor the presence of contaminants in food,
feed, and environment. In 2011, Lu and group published a study1 in which they reported a method for expanding
the principle of the glucose meter to detect different analytes. Sia
and Curtis2 showed the design and realization
of a small device able to analyze whole blood samples in a few seconds
and provided quantitative measurements.

In the agrofood sector,
user-friendly devices represent a valid
tool for on-site determination of contaminants. Food contaminants
such as aflatoxins (AFs), a group of toxic substances produced by
fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, represent a major public
health problem due to their carcinogenic activity.3 The ability of these species of fungi to grow on different
cereals (corn, wheat, rice, and peanuts) and dried fruits extend their
presence in the food chain.4,5

AFM1 detection
in whole milk is a crucial issue for farmers for
the production of good and safe milk. The current methods used to
monitor the presence of AFM1 in milk are time consuming and require
a highly trained personnel.6−8 In this study, we developed a
new method for the rapid detection of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk-collected
daily by farmers in less than 2 h. In particular, we developed an
immune-detection strip containing invertase-conjugated antibody anti-AFM1.
We showed that it is possible to detect the presence of 27 parts per
trillion (ppt) of AFM1 in whole milk by measuring the glucose produced
by the invertase-conjugated antibody anti-AFM1 strip after 1 h of
incubation. The novelty of this method is that it only requires to
produce glucose by an invertase-linked immunosorbent assay (InLISA)
and monitors it by a simple glucose detection. The method, therefore,
provides an important opportunity to advance the rapid detection of
the presence of AFM1 in whole milk.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
All reagents were of the
highest commercially available quality and were used as received.
1-[3-(Dimethylamino)-propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC), carboxymethoxylamine
hemihydrochloride, EAH Sepharose 4B resin, bovine serum albumin (BSA)-aflatoxin
M1 (AFM1), invertase, and all buffers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
AFM1 was purchased from Apollo Scientific. Nitrocellulose transfer
membrane Protran and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents,
used in western blot experiments, were purchased from Schleicher &
Schuell and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Goat polyclonal antibody
to rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (secondary antibody)
was purchased from Abcam. BSA was from Pierce. Glutamine-binding protein
(GlnBP) was purified in our laboratory according to Staiano.9 Ovalbumin (OVA) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.
Aflatoxin-HRP was purchased from Beacon Analytical Systems (ORSell).
Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and EAH Sepharose 4B resins were purchased
from GE Healthcare. Sera against AFM1 were from Covalab.

2.2 Antibodies Antiaflatoxin M1 Production and
Purification
Rabbits were immunized through a standard protocol,
by intradermal injection of commercial BSA-aflatoxin M1. At the end
of the immunization period, blood from rabbits was recuperated and
centrifuged to isolate serum from blood cells. A 2.0 mL of sample
(1 mL for each rabbits) was diluted 1/1 in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0
(binding buffer) and applied to 0.5 mL of resin Protein A Sepharose
4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). The IgG samples were purified as reported
by Varriale.10 The immunoglobulin G (IgG)
samples were eluted with glycine (0.1 M), pH 2.8, and promptly buffered
with 1.0 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.8. The IgG elutions were checked following
the absorbance at λ = 278 nm, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out to assess the purity
of the samples. The obtained total IgG was dialyzed against 10 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.

2.3 Synthesis
of Aflatoxin M1 Derivative and Production
of Aflatoxin M1-GlnBP Conjugate
The AFM1 derivative compound
was obtained as described by Chu11 using
1.0 mg of AFM1 (99%, 3.05 μmol, Sigma-Aldrich). To avoid interference,
the AFM1 derivative was conjugated to the glutamine-binding protein
(GlnBP). The following procedure was used: 3 μmol (1.0 mg) AFM1
derivative was suspended in ethanol and mixed with an aqueous solution
of 4.84 μmol EDC. The solution was diluted up to 840 μL
with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and incubated for 20
min at room temperature. Then, the mixture was incubated with 4.84
nM of GlnBP, dissolved in 160 μL of 10 mM potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 6.0, and again incubated for 24 h at room temperature under continuous stirring.

2.4 Aflatoxin M1-EAH Sepharose Resin Preparation
and Purified Antibodies against Aflatoxin M1
The affinity
resin was obtained by conjugating the AFM1 derivative to EAH Sepharose
4B. For this purpose, the protocol reported by Varriale10 was used. In brief, 1.2 mL of Sepharose resin
suspension was washed sequentially with deionized water at pH 4.5
(160 mL), with 0.5 M NaCl (100 mL), and again with deionized water
at pH 4.5 (100 mL). Then, the resin was packed into a polystyrene
column, suspended in 2.0 mL of water at pH 4.5, and gently shaken.

AFM1-oxime (15.3 μmol) diluted with methanol was preincubated
for 10 min with 400 μmol EDC (0.1 M at pH 4.5) and then added
to a slurry resin and gently shaken overnight at 4 °C. At the
end of this step, the resin was washed with a solution of 0.5 M NaCl
in 50% methanol (15 mL) and treated with 15 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid,
pH 4.0, 0.5 M NaCl in 50% methanol (blocking buffer), 0.1 M Tris/HCl,
pH 7.0, and 0.5 M NaCl in 50 % methanol (washing buffer). The obtained
EAH-AFM1 resin was used to purify the monospecific antibody against
AFM1. In brief, 8.0 mg of IgG (2.0 mg/mL) was diluted to 1:1 with
50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and incubated on the affinity column. The
column was previously washed with 20 column volumes of 50 mM Tris/HCl,
pH 7.0, to eliminate the presence of unspecific antibodies, and then,
a solution of 0.1 M glycine/HCl, pH 3.0, was used to elute the monospecific
antibody. Throughout this paper, the term IgGM1-MS will refer to purified
monospecific IgG against AFM1. The samples were collected, and the
concentration of the antibodies was determined by the absorbance value
at λ = 278 nm, using as ε1% = 14. The samples
were recovered and stored at 4 °C.

2.5 Western
Blotting Experiments
SDS-PAGE
at 12% of proteins, AFM1-GlnBP, and GlnBP (10 μg each) was performed
and then was transferred overnight at 4 °C onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in
50 mL of the blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% skim milk, 0.2% Tween-20,
and 0.05% Triton (PBS-TT)).

At the end of the blocking step,
two washing steps with PBS-TT and PBS sequentially (10 min for each
washing) were performed before incubating the membrane with anti-AFM1
(1:500 diluted in the blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature.

After these steps, the membrane was washed (with PBS-TT and PBS)
incubated with the secondary antibody (goat antirabbit HRP conjugate,
1:3000 in the blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature and then
it was washed and incubated with the detection reagent ECL.

2.6 Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA)
The titer of anti-AFM1 produced was determined by
an indirect ELISA test. In brief, the antigen GlnBP-AFM1 was diluted
at different concentrations in the coating buffer (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4)
and used to coat the wells of microplates (100 μL per well).
As control, BSA was used in this experiment. At the end of the overnight
incubation and the washing steps (three times with 0.1 PBS and 0.05%
Tween, at pH 7.4), a blocking step was performed through incubation
with PBS containing Tween
(PBS-T) detergent and 5% milk (100 μL each well) for 2 h at
room temperature.

Then, the wells were washed and incubated
with serially diluted antibody (from 1/500 to 1/12 000) IgGM1-MS
at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, the wells were rinsed three
times with PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
antirabbit IgG antibodies, diluted 1:4000 in PBS-T, 1% milk, and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed with PBS-T, the
enzyme substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine was
added (100 μL per well), and the color reaction was quenched
after 5 min by addition of 1.0 M H2SO4 (100
μL per well). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The antibody
titer was graphically determined by plotting the reciprocal of the
antibody dilution vs absorbance for each dilution of antibodies (data
not shown). The antibody titer was determined as reported by Varriale,10 and the value for purified IgGM1-MS was found
to be 1/25 000.

2.7 Competitive ELISA
The resulting purified
monospecific IgG anti-AFM1 (IgGMS-M1) were used for an indirect competitive
ELISA. In this assay, 25 ng of GlnBP-AFM1 was used for each well.
Each experiment was performed in triplicate. For the competitive assay,
the selected antibody dilution (1:6000 that is 1.0 μL in 6.0
mL of buffer) was preincubated with an increasing amount of AFM1 diluted
in a methanol solution before performing the standard ELISA. We performed
the preincubation step for 30 min of IgGMS-M1 with increasing concentrations
of AFM1, from 0.125 to 8 ppt. After this step, we performed the standard
protocol of ELISA as reported above. Data management and analysis
were performed using the OriginPro 7.5 program.

2.8 Production of IgGMS-M1-Invertase Conjugate
To obtain
a suitable conjugate with IgGs, the invertase was activated
by glutaraldehyde as a homo-bifunctional linker.6 For this purpose, 10 mg of yeast invertase was dialyzed
four times for 2 h at room temperature against 250 mL of 0.01 M sodium
phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. Afterward, glutaraldehyde was added to
a final concentration of 1.25% to 1.0 mL of invertase solution (6.5
mg/mL). The solution was placed under mild stirring conditions overnight
at room temperature. Afterward, the excess of glutaraldehyde was removed
by dialyzing three times for 2 h at 4 °C against 250 mL of 100
mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 150 mM NaCl. The molar ratio
between the invertase and IgGs in this reaction was 5:1. To achieve
this, 200 μL of a new preparation of IgGs at a concentration
of 8 mg/mL (1.6 mg total), obtained from the rabbit sera, was dissolved
in 800 μL of solution comprising 500 mM sodium carbonate buffer,
pH 9.6, and placed in a 2.0 mL Eppendorf tube. Later, 1.0 mL of invertase
containing 6.5 mg of invertase activated with glutaraldehyde was added.
It was placed under mild stirring for overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently,
100 μL of a solution of 200 mM ethanolamine, pH 7.0, was added
and the solution was placed under stirring for 2 h at 4 °C. The
conjugate was centrifuged at 16 000g for 20
min at 4 °C and dialyzed five times against 200 mL of 50 mM Tris/HCl
buffer, pH 7.4. The sample was recovered and stored at 4 °C.
Different dilutions 1:100 (2 μL of conjugate and 198 μL
of sample for each assay) were used for each experiment, and the experiments
were performed in triplicate.

2.9 Production
of the Aflatoxin Strip
The purified conjugate IgGMS-M1-INV
was tested on nitrocellulose
strips previously incubated with different protein solutions.

The strips (1.0 x 3.0 cm2) were placed in an Eppendorf
tube and incubated with 1.0 mL of different protein solutions. For
this purpose, 150 μg of OVA and 150 μg of GlnBP were used
as negative controls. This experiment was performed to verify the
ability of the conjugates to detect a commercial protein conjugated
to various aflatoxins used in the competitive ELISA kit. A solution
of peroxidase-conjugated aflatoxin (50 μL, aflatoxin-HRP, 6
mg/mL) was diluted in 1.0 mL of TBS (20 mM Tris/HCl, 130 mM NaCl)
before incubating with the nitrocellulose strip for 1 h at room temperature
under mild stirring. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose strips were
incubated with 1 mL of 0.5% OVA TBS-T (0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h at
room temperature under mild stirring. Three washing steps were performed
in 1.0 mL of TBS-T, and the strips were incubated overnight at 4 °C
with a dilution of IgGMS-M1-INV. The IgGMS-M1-INV conjugates were
used at a dilution of (1:100 of 0.5 % OVA in TBS-T). Three washing
steps were performed (10 min with TBS-T). The strips were incubated
at room temperature with 500 μL of a buffer solution containing
an excess of substrate (2:3 of 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.6, and
1:3 of a solution at 10% w/v sucrose) to verify the invertase activity.
After performing various incubations at varying durations, withdrawals
of 33 μL and final 100 μL were tested with the d-glucose kit (Megazyme) for the detection of glucose produced by
the immunoconjugate IgGMS-M1-INV. To perform a test in real matrices,
the conjugate (IgGMS-M1-INV) was added to a solution of milk and methanol
for extraction/dilution of AFM1. The assay was performed by diluting
the IgGMS-M1-INV conjugate in a solution of whole milk at 33% in 0.25%
OVA TBS-T; in all samples, 10% of methanol with or without AFM1 dilution
was added. All experiments were performed three times.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis of the Aflatoxin
M1 Derivative and
Aflatoxin M1-GlnBP Conjugate
AFM1 (Figure 1A) lacks anchoring sites for conjugation
with biomolecules. Consequently, a short linker arm was introduced
by condensation on the carbonyl to form an oxime.11 The obtained AFM1-oxime (Figure 1B) derivative was conjugated through the
well-known EDC conjugation procedure at two different protein carriers.
BSA-AFM1 conjugate was used to produce polyclonal antibodies against
AFM1.12,13 The total IgGs obtained were purified (Figure 2A) and tested for
their ability to bind with AFM1. For this purpose, to avoid carrier
interference, the AFM1 derivative was conjugated to GlnBP isolated
from Escherichia coli.9

Figure 1 Aflatoxin M1 structure and synthesis of the AFM1 derivate used
in the conjugation reaction with GlnBP.

Figure 2 New SDS-PAGE of anti-AFM1 purified antibodies (IgGMS-M1) on EAH-AFM1
resin (A). ELISA test performed against different antigens (BSA/GlnBP/GlnBP-AFM1)
with different collected samples during immunoaffinity purification
(B) and western blotting (C).

In Figure 2B, the
results of the ELISA tests are reported. The purified monospecific
IgG anti-AFM1 (IgGMS-M1) are able to recognize GlnBP-AFM1 and BSA
(immunization carrier), but they are not able to bind to GlnBP (negative
control). The same results were obtained from the western blotting
experiment (Figure 2C).

3.2 Competitive Indirect ELISA with IgGMS-M1
In Figure 3, the
competitive ELISA experiments are reported in which the binding efficiency
of IgGMS-M1 was tested in the presence of different concentrations
of AFM1. The data show that the purified IgGMS-M1 are able to recognize
the AFM1 conjugate to GlnBP. This allowed the setup of a sensitive
assay for the detection of AFM1 up to 125 ppq (0.125 ppt). In fact,
an increasing inhibition of IgGMS-M1 binding from 40% up to 80% on
coated GlnBP-AFM1 inside the wells was obtained (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Indirect competitive
ELISA in the presence of an increasing concentration
of AFM1 from 0.125 ppt up to 8 ppt, during the preincubation time
of IgGMS-M1 purified on EAH-AFM1 resin.

3.3 Production of the IgGMS-M1-Invertase Conjugate
A suitable strip assay derivatized with the IgGMS-M1-invertase
conjugate was tested on whole milk samples. First, we prepared an
invertase-IgGMS-M1 conjugate using glutaraldehyde as homo-bifunctional
cross-linkers14 and obtained the IgGMS-M1-INV
conjugate. Then, a dilution of this preparation (IgGMS-M1-INV) was
used in the dot blot experiment for the detection of AFM1 directly
in milk (data not shown). For the production of the AFM1 strip, several
strips of nitrocellulose of 1 cm2 were incubated with aflatoxin-HRP,
GlnBP, and OVA as negative controls for about 2 h and then incubated
with an excess of OVA (5 mg/mL) to saturate all of the binding sites
on the nitrocellulose strips. The IgGMS-M1-INV was diluted (a ratio
of 1:100) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washing steps, it was possible
to detect the invertase activity only on the strip on which aflatoxin-HRP
was spotted and not with other immobilized proteins such as OVA and
GlnBP.

3.4 Competitive Strip Assay in Real Matrix (InLISA)
In Figure 4, the
principle of the assay using the developed strip is shown. The absence
or the presence of AFM1 in the sample modulates the glucose concentration
produced. In particular, the absence of the toxin in the milk sample
allows for binding of IgGMS-M1-INV on the surface of the strip. Consequently,
a high concentration of glucose will be detected. On the contrary,
the presence of the toxin in the milk sample will get
out the IgGMS-M1-INV from the solution and only few molecules will
be able to bind at the strip. As a consequence, a low amount of glucose
will be produced.

Figure 4 Cartoon representation of the immunoreaction of the IgGMS-M1-INV
conjugate on the strip derivatized with aflatoxin-protein.

In Figure 5, the
absorption values of the absorbance at 510 nm against the AFM1 concentration
are reported. The data show that the absorption is directly proportional
to glucose concentrations, and after an incubation of 1 h in the absence
of AFM1, 1.5 μg of glucose is produced. In the presence of AFM1,
a decrease in glucose production by 80% and 50% was recorded after
preincubation with the IgGMS-M1-INV conjugate in diluted milk-AFM1
at 54 and 27 ppt, respectively. A positive control was performed on
the strip derivatized with aflatoxin-protein incubated with IgGMS-M1-INV
without AFM1, and a a negative control was performed on a strip derivatized
with OVA incubated with IgGMS-M1-INV in whole milk without AFM1.

Figure 5 Direct
competitive (InLISA) assay in the presence of 27 and 54
ppt of AFM1 during the preincubation time of the IgGMS-M1-INV conjugate
in whole milk. Positive control: strip derivatized with aflatoxin-protein
incubated with IgGMS-M1-INV without AFM1; negative control: strip
derivatized with ovalbumin incubated with IgGMS-M1-INV in whole milk,
also without AFM1.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we have developed an innovative assay for the detection
of AFM1 directly in whole milk. The assay is based on the principle
that the amount of toxin present in milk can be easily correlated
to the amount of glucose produced by the invertase.

In the literature,
the main advantages of the use of glucose detection
as an analytical tool are reported.15,16 In fact, due
to its simple usability, glucometer can be used by millions of unskilled
young and old potential users around the world. The possibility to
engineer commercial glucometers to sense lower amounts of glucose
will allow to perform the analyses directly on-site.
