A new
class of TiO2-doped CeO2 nanorods was
synthesized via a modified hydrothermal method, and these nanorods
were first used as catalysts for the direct synthesis of dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) from CO2 and CH3OH in a fixed-bed
reactor. The micromorphologies and physical–chemical properties
of nanorods were characterized by transmission electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and
temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and carbon dioxide (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD). The effects of the TiO2 doping ratio on the catalytic performances were fully investigated.
By doping TiO2, the surface acid–base sites of CeO2 nanorods can be obviously promoted and the catalytic activity
can be raised evidently. Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalysts exhibited remarkably high activity with a methanol
conversion of 5.38% with DMC selectivity of 83.1%. Furthermore, kinetic
and mechanistic investigations based on the initial rate method were
conducted. Over the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst, the apparent activation energy of the reaction
was 46.3 kJ/mol. The reaction rate law was determined to be of positive
first-order to the CO2 concentration and the catalyst loading
amount. These results were practically identical with the prediction
of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism in which the steps of
CO2 adsorption and activation are considered as rate-determining
steps.

==== Body
Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major greenhouse gas that
contributes to Earth’s global warming.1 The emission of CO2 has been significantly increased
within the past years and is still increasing each year. Over the
last decade, the utilization of CO2 has attracted scientists’
attention because it is known as a naturally plentiful and recyclable
carbon source for the production of chemical feedstocks.2,3

Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is an important chemical material4−6 because it serves as an environmentally friendly intermediate and
a nontoxic substitute for poisonous and corrosive phosgene and dimethyl
sulfate in the reaction of carbonylation and methylation,7−10 as well as a promising fuel additive.11,12 Because of
the high demand, a lot of efforts have been made to find a sustainable
way to mass-produce DMC13 and several routes
have been developed: carbonylation of methanol,14 transesterification of carbonates,15 methanolysis of urea,16 and direct synthesis
of DMC from CO2 and methanol17−20 technologies.17−20

Among all of these routes,
the first three synthesis methods are
still far from perfect with rigorous conduct conditions, highly toxic
and severely corrosive.13,21 Therefore, the direct
synthesis of DMC from CO2 and methanol has gradually become
the most attractive approach as such a method is environmentally friendly
not only for developing new carbon resources but also for reducing
greenhouse gas emission.22 However, there
also exist significant challenges. DMC productivity is relatively
low due to the fact that CO2 is highly thermodynamically
stable and kinetically inert as well as because of the deactivation
of catalysts induced by water formation in the reaction process.9,23

A number of methods to improve the DMC yield have been developed,24 including adding coreagents25 and removing water by dehydrants26 in the reaction systems. Furthermore, some new technologies, such
as the photoassistant,27 electroassistant,28 membrane separation,29 and supercritical CO210,30 technologies
have been introduced. However, the DMC yield is far from satisfaction.
Although all of these approaches are pursued today, developing efficient
catalysts, especially heterogeneous catalysts, is still considered
to be the most effective route.31,32 Compared with homogeneous
catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts are difficult to deactivate, convenient
to separate, easy to recycle, and environmentally friendly.13,33 Hence, the exploitation of heterogeneous catalysts is regarded as
the first choice for the direct synthesis of DMC, especially metal
oxide catalysts,34,35 heteropoly acid catalysts,36 and bimetallic supported catalysts.23

As an excellent metal oxide catalyst with
both Lewis acid and base
properties, CeO2 particularly shows high catalytic activities
in the direct synthesis of DMC.37,38 There are a number
of references in which it is also employed as a catalyst in the reaction
involving dehydration.39 In addition, on
the basis of previous studies, various morphologies of dispersible
CeO2 nanocrystals have been synthesized including nanoparticles,
polyhedra, nanocubes, and nanorods.40−42 Also, through theoretical
simulation, it was found that three low-index crystal planes exposed
on CeO2 nanocrystals were strongly affected by their morphology,
exhibiting different properties and further influencing the catalytic
activity for the direct synthesis of DMC.43,44 Previous studies of Wang et al. have revealed that the CeO2 nanorod catalyst with the most (1 1 0) facet exhibited the most
favorable catalytic activities for the direct synthesis of DMC when
compared to those of CeO2 nanocubes with the (1 0 0) facet
and CeO2 nano-octahedra with the (111) facet.45

In addition to neat CeO2, TiO2-modified CeO2 has attracted significant attention
for catalytic applications
due to the enhanced properties. Various studies on TiO2-doped CeO2 catalysts have shown enhancements in redox
reactions.46,47 It was proved that the oxygen
deficiency and acidity of the surface can be significantly enhanced
by doping TiO2 into CeO2.48 Thus, we carried out further research on TiO2-doped CeO2 nanorod catalysts.

In this work, we
first report a new class of TiO2-promoted
CeO2 nanorod catalysts for the direct synthesis of DMC
from CO2 and methanol. The recyclability of the catalysts
was also explored. We also presented a detailed kinetic model for
the direct synthesis of DMC in a continuous fixed bed reactor over
CeO2-based catalysts. These will be certainly helpful for
a comprehensive understanding of the reaction.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
of the Prepared Catalysts
The morphology
of CeO2 and TixCe1–xO2 nanorod catalysts was observed by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and the images are shown in Figure S1. From TEM images of pure CeO2 nanorods (Figure S1a,b), it can be seen
that CeO2 exhibits intact nanorods. The morphological parameters
measured from TEM observation show that CeO2 nanorods have
an average length of around 50–100 nm with an external diameter
of about 10 nm. After being modified by TiO2, the nanorod
structure was not destroyed and the size of nanorods remained almost
unchanged, suggesting the well dispersion of TiO2 among
the nanorods.

Microstructure of the Prepared Catalysts
The crystal
structures of CeO2 and TixCe1–xO2 nanorod catalysts
were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the spectra are
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 XRD patterns

CeO2, (b) Ti0.02Ce0.98O2, (c) Ti0.04Ce0.96O2, (d) Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, (e) Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and (f) Ti0.1Ce0.9O2.

For neat CeO2 nanorods (Figure 1a), the diffraction peaks (at 2θ of
28.6° (111), 33.1° (200), 47.6° (220), 56.4° (311),
59.2° (222), and 69.5° (400)) can be assigned to the cubic
phase of CeO2 (JCPDS 65-5923). After doping, the spectra
of Ti0.02Ce0.98O2 and Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorods (Figure 1b,c) remained unchanged, indicating that
TiO2 disperses well among the nanorods. However, for Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and Ti0.1Ce0.9O2, diffraction peaks of TiO2 (2θ of 27.6°
(110) and 41.3° (111)) can be observed, suggesting that TiO2 particles are bigger and appear individually in nanorods.
Furthermore, the average grain size (Table 1) in the series of nanorods decreases from
11.04 to 8.19 nm in the fluorite structure along with the doping of
TiO2.

c Content of Ti in the bulk phase
was calculated with O elimination according to the ICP-AES result.

d Content of Ti on the surface
was
calculated with O elimination according to the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) result.

Textures of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area of the nanorods decreases slightly from
75.3 to 71.5 m2/g upon increasing the TiO2 doping
ratio to 0.04, indicating that the introduction of TiO2 almost has no effect on the surface area within a suitable ratio.
However, with a higher TiO2 content (Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and Ti0.1Ce0.9O2), the
specific surface area decreases significantly, which may cause the
exposure of less active sites and thus lead to a lower activity. It
also shows that the pore volume of nanorods increases slightly and
then drops evidently as TiO2 doping ratio increases. To
sum up, the samples of Ti0.02Ce0.98O2 and Ti0.04Ce0.69O2 nanorods have
almost the same specific surface area, larger pore volume, and smaller
average grain sizes when compared to those of neat CeO2 nanorods. The bulk phase and surface compositions of prepared nanorods
were investigated by ICP-AES and XPS, respectively. It can be seen
that the content of Ti matches well with the added proportion of raw
materials both on the surface and in bulk phase. This illustrates
that the composition of nanorods is homogeneous.

XPS Investigations
of the Prepared Catalysts
XPS analysis
was performed to lucubrate the surface chemical state of Ce, Ti, and
O in prepared nanorods. Ce 3d, Ti 2p, and O 1s spectra of CeO2 and TixCe1–xO2 nanorods are shown in Figures 2–4, respectively.

Figure 2 XPS Ce 3d spectra of CeO2 and TixCe1–xO2 nanorods:
(a) CeO2, (b) Ti0.02Ce0.98O2, (c) Ti0.04Ce0.96O2, (d) Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, (e) Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and (f) Ti0.1Ce0.9O2.

The labels used for identifying
Ce 3d XPS peaks were established
by Burroughs et al.,49 where V and U indicate
the spin–orbit couplings of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. The peaks referred to as v, v″, and v‴
are contributed by CeO2 and assigned to a mixture of Ce
IV (3d94f2) O (2p4), Ce IV (3d94f1) O (2p5), and Ce IV (3d94f0) O (2p6), respectively.48,50 The same peak assignment is applied to u structures. Peaks v0 and v′ are assigned to a mixture of Ce III (3d94f2) O (2p5) and Ce III (3d94f1) O (2p6), respectively. The Ce 3d spectrum
of CeO2 (Figure 2a) shows six peaks at 917.9, 908.3, 902.1, 899.9, 888.9, and
883.4 eV. These peaks indicate the existence of Ce4+ and
progressively decrease with the increased amount of Ti doping. In
contrast, the intensity of peaks at 903.7 and 887.8 eV increases as
the Ti doping ratio increases, which reveals the increase of Ce3+ concentration. On the basis of the curve-fitting method
established by Watanabe et al.,48 the XPS
spectra forecast that the surface concentration of Ce3+ in nanorods varies with the amount of Ti doping from 5.1% in CeO2 nanorods to 22.4% in Ti0.1Ce0.9O2 nanorods. Ce3+ concentration shows an apparently
linear relationship with Ti doping, as shown in Figure S3. As a consequence, introducing TiO2 into
CeO2 leads to the partial reduction of Ce4+.

Concomitant with the change of Ce in CeO2 nanorods upon
Ti doping, the chemical state of Ti also changes. Figure 3 shows Ti 2p1/2 and
Ti 2p3/2 spectra of TixCe1–xO2 nanorods. The Ti 2p3/2 peak shifts from 458.0 eV in Ti0.02Ce0.98O2 to 458.6 eV in Ti0.1Ce0.9O2, representing intermediate TiO2 incorporation
into nanorods. Thus, the XPS result reveals the significant reduction
and higher degree of oxygen deficiency of Ce and Ti due to the doping.

Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and (e) Ti0.1Ce0.9O2.

Figure 4 shows the O 1s spectra of prepared nanorods.
The binding
energy of the surface oxygen is pretty susceptible to the concentrations
of Ce and Ti in TixCe1–xO2 nanorods, shifting from 528.8 to 529.4
eV upon increasing the Ti concentration. Furthermore, O 1s peaks corresponding
to TiO2 and CeO2 do not appear in the spectra
individually, suggesting that Ti and Ce chemically interact with each
other in nanorods. Thus, TixCe1–xO2 nanorods are not simple mixtures of
two different oxides but rather a homogeneous solid solution with
chemical interactions.

Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) Investigations
of the
Prepared Catalysts
To further explore the surface acid–base
properties, NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD techniques were
employed and the results are shown in Figures S4 and S5, respectively. All profiles can be deconvoluted into
three Gaussian peaks.

Figure S4 displays
the NH3-TPD profiles of CeO2 and TixCe1–xO2 nanorods. The amount of acidic sites and peak positions are summarized
in Table 2. For all
nanorods, three small peaks assigned to weakly (100–200 °C),
moderately (200–400 °C), and strongly (400–600
°C) acidic sites can be found. For Ti0.02Ce0.98O2 and Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorods, more moderately acidic sites are formed and increase with
the increasing TiO2 content, which has already been proved
to be beneficial to the formation of DMC.51 However, for Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and Ti0.1Ce0.9O2 nanorods, the amount of moderately acidic
sites decreases, which can be ascribed to the following reasons: the
specific surface area decreases rapidly upon increasing the TiO2 content, which can then result in less exposed active sites.

Figure S5 displays CO2-TPD
profiles of CeO2 and TixCe1–xO2 nanorods. The amount
of basic sites and peak positions are summarized in Table 3. For all nanorods, three small
peaks assigned to weakly (100–200 °C), moderately (200–400
°C), and strongly (400–600 °C) basic sites can be
found. Similar to acidic sites, moderately basic sites increase first
for CeO2, Ti0.02Ce0.98O2, and Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorods and
then decrease in the following order: Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and
Ti0.1Ce0.9O2 nanorods. It can be
observed that the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod
possesses the largest amount of both acidity and basicity. This is
mainly due to the increase of Ce–O, Ti–O pairs on the
surface, which can provide more active sites, as well as keeping undiminished
specific surface area when compared to that of neat CeO2 nanorods.

Catalytic
Performance
The effects of TiO2 content on the
catalytic performance were investigated, and the
catalytic process was carried out in a 50 mL autoclave microreactor
with high-velocity mechanical stirring. The results are shown in Table 4 and serve as a basis
for original selection of nanorod catalysts.

a The nanorods were calcined in air

b The reaction conditions are as follow:
0.20 g of catalysts; 15 mL of MeOH; initial pressure, 5 MPa; reaction
temperature, 120 °C, reaction time, 5 h.

The neat CeO2 nanorod catalyst shows much
lower DMC
yield than that of TixCe1–xO2 nanorods. The DMC yield increases with
the increasing TiO2 content, reaching a maximum, and then
decreases with a further increase in the TiO2 amount. Among
the catalysts examined, the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst shows the highest DMC yield of 4.70 mmol
g/cat, much higher than that of the neat CeO2 nanorod catalyst,
which shows the activity of 3.20 mmol g/cat.

In association
to the result of N2 adsorption, Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and Ti0.1Ce0.9O2 nanorod
catalysts with a smaller surface area exhibit lower
catalytic performance, suggesting that the catalytic activity is correlated
to the surface area of the catalysts. Small surface area generally
causes the exposure of less active sites and leads to a lower catalytic
activity.52,53

In addition, according to the mechanism
of the synthesis of DMC
from CH3OH and CO2, methanol and CO2 are absorbed and activated on the acidic and basic sites of the
catalyst, respectively.54 Therefore, in
this study, the low catalytic activity of the neat CeO2 nanorod catalyst may result from the smaller amount of acidic and
basic sites on the surface, which leads to less activated methanol
and CO2. TixCe1–xO2 nanorod catalysts exhibit higher catalytic
activities than those of neat CeO2 nanorods. It can be
attributed to the increased amount of moderately acidic and basic
sites with the addition of TiO2.

Figures S6 and S7 show the relationships
between the catalytic activity and the amount of moderately acidic
and basic sites, respectively. It can be seen that the DMC yield increases
linearly upon increasing moderately acidic and basic sites. Combining
TPD, XRD, and N2 adsorption results, it is revealed that
the coexistence of nanorod structures of CeO2 and TiO2 favors the formation of moderately acidic and basic sites.
The lower catalytic activity of Ti0.06Ce0.94O2, Ti0.08Ce0.92O2, and
Ti0.1Ce0.9O2 nanorods is presumably
due to the decrease of specific surface area, which reduces the surface
moderately acidic and basic sites.

After the original selection,
further research of DMC formation
from methanol and CO2 with Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorods was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor
(Scheme S1). The effects of different catalytic
conditions on the activities of Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalysts for DMC synthesis were fully investigated,
and the results are summarized in Table 5. The catalytic performance gives a crest
value at 140 °C while the reaction temperature varies from 110
to 160 °C. Higher pressures are favorable for methanol conversion
but adverse to DMC selectivity, leading to the highest yield of DMC
at 1.0 MPa. The catalytic activities decline slightly with the increasing
space velocity. Therefore, reaction conditions were selected for further
exploration at 140 °C and 1.0 MPa and space velocity of 360 h–1.

Further investigation of the recyclability

out, and the
used nanorods were recovered by recalcination before reusing them
for DMC formation under the same catalytic conditions. SBET and catalytic activities of the recycled catalysts
are presented in Table 6. Both the catalytic activities and SBET were found dropping as the number of recycles increases, which is
mainly due to the redispersion of active sites during the regeneration
of catalyst. However, Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorods exhibit pretty good stability for the direct synthesis
of DMC from CO2 and methanol.

Effect of Dehydrant on DMC Formation
To explore the
effect of dehydrant, further DMC synthesis reactions were carried
out with various dehydrants, including 2,2-dimethoxypropane, cyclohexene
oxide, and 2-cyanopyridine dissolved in reactant methanol (dehydrants/methanol
= 5.0 wt %). As shown in Table 7, 2-cyanopyridine turned out to be the best, enhancing DMC
yield from 4.47 to 7.83%. In addition, 2,2-dimethoxypropane exhibited
excellently improved effect with DMC yield of 6.76%. Surprisingly,
cyclohexene oxide also showed pretty good promotion of DMC yield of
6.30%. These results indicate that the dehydrant played important
roles in direct DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol with
a positive effect on the DMC yield.

a Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorods were calcined in air under 600 °C for
4 h. Catalyst weight: 2.0 g. Time on stream: 7 h. The results were
the average data between 2 and 4 h with time on stream.

Kinetic Insights
Further kinetic
exploration for the
direct synthesis of DMC with the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst was conducted in an optimized fixed-bed
reactor (Schedule S2). On the basis of former literature reports,
two different mechanisms are involved and the apparent rate law can
be obtained based on the controlling step of each mechanism further
(Table 8).55,56 Regarding the Eley–Rideal (ER) mechanism, it assumes that
CO2 reacts directly with the activated MeOH group adsorbed
on the catalyst surface because the adsorption of MeOH seems to be
much stronger with the MeOH* and CO2 combination (S2) as
the rate-determining step. While considering the adsorption of all
species on the catalyst, the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism
declares that CO2 and methanol should interact with the
catalyst surface in two separate steps. However, there are controversial
opinions on the controlling step for the LH mechanism, of which Tomishige
et al.55 and Marin et al.57 regard the formation of DMC* (S3) and the activation of
CO2 (S1) as rate-determining steps, respectively. In this
research, we take both viewpoints into consideration. For convenience,
the apparent reaction rate expressions can be deduced from the mechanisms
considering each step as an elementary reaction and defining the controlling
step (full details are given in Supporting Information).

a * = Active sites; MC = methyl carbonate.

It can be inferred that the initial rate should be
a function contrast
the reactants concentration and catalysts loading amount. In addition,
the rate constant should be strictly controlled by the reaction temperature
and activation energy of the catalysts. Therefore, a series of initial
rate measurement experiments were carried out in which the amount
of CO2, methanol, and Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst was varied while retaining constant
pressure of 1.0 MPa and temperature of 140 °C. The reaction was
terminated at 120 min because the initial rate remains linear within
2 h, and the conversion of methanol and productivity of DMC were quantified
by gas chromatography. The detailed reaction conditions and results
of these experiments are shown in Table S1.

As predicted, there is an apparent direct positive correlation
between the consumption of catalyst versus the initial rate as the
catalyst load increases from 1.0 to 1.6 g (Figure 5). The ln–ln plot of the initial rate
versus active site concentration (measured in total surface area and
expressed in m2) reveals the existence of an approximately
first-order reaction, revealing that the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorods catalyzed heterogeneously without any mass
transport limitations. The result indicates that the amount of catalyst
loading strongly impacts the initial rate of the reaction, suggesting
that the rate-limiting step of the reaction occurs on the surface
of the catalysts.

Figure 5 Kinetic study of the initial rate of DMC production vs
catalyst
loading. Active sites are measured in total surface area and expressed
in m2.

Table 9 shows the
analysis results of DMC formation with different CO2 and
MeOH feedings. For the ER mechanism, we consider the combination of
MeOH* and CO2 as the rate-determining step; thus, there
should be a positive linear relationship between PCO2·PMeOH and
the initial rate. The ln–ln plots of these two parameters are
given in Figure S8, and the negative slope
of the fitting line suggests that the ER mechanism is inadequate to
expound the kinetic process of DMC formation with the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor.
These mainly account for wrongly ignoring the direct adsorption and
activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface though it is
much weaker than that of methanol.

For the LH mechanism, with the MeOH*
and CO2* combination
as the rate-determining step, there should be a positive linear relationship
between PCO2·PMeOH2 and the initial rate, which is drawn
as ln–ln plots in Figure S9 and
which shows a negative liner dependence actually. Moreover, regarding
the adsorption and activation of CO2 as the rate-controlling
step, there is a direct relationship between PCO2 and the initial rate as the feeding of reactants
varied (Figure 6),
giving a slope in close proximity to +1 (1.080). This indicates that
the observed experimental rate equation was roughly as follows: initial
rate = k [CO2]−1 [*]−1, which is consistent with the prediction of the LH
mechanism with CO2 activation as the rate-determining step.

study of the initial rate of DMC production with different
CO2 and methanol feedings based on the LH mechanism with
the activation of CO2 as the rate-controlling step.

Further investigation of the initial
rate was carried out at 125,
130, 135, and 140 °C while maintaining constant 1.0 g load of
the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst,
constant 1.0 MPa reaction pressure, and consistent feeding flow of
methanol and CO2. The results are summarized in the Arrhenius
plot (Figure 7). The
liner fitting slope of −5.565 indicates an apparent activation
energy of 46.3 ± 5.0 kJ/mol for the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst, which is lower than that of the neat
CeO2 nanorod catalyst (65 kJ/mol).57 This forcefully suggests that the incorporation of TiO2 in nanorods has improved the catalytic activity of the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst through the improvements
in surface active sites.

for the direct synthesis
of DMC with Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 and neat
CeO2 nanorod catalyst. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of this reaction was found to be 46.3 ±
5.0 kJ/mol for the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst and 67.9 ± 7.5 kJ/mol for the neat CeO2 nanorod catalyst.

Conclusions
In summary, a new class of TixCe1–xO2 nanorods catalysts
for the direct DMC formation in a fixed-bed reactor is first synthesized
and reported. The influences of the TiO2 doping ratio in
the nanorods and various reaction conditions on the catalytic performances
were investigated. It is found that the catalytic performance of ceria
nanorods can be greatly enhanced with the introduction of TiO2 because the nanorod catalysts with more surface acidic–basic
sites presented better catalytic activities. The Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst exhibits superior
catalytic performances than those of neat CeO2 and TixCe1–xO2 nanorods with other TiO2 doping ratios. Under
optimal reaction conditions, the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic performance
with a methanol conversion of 5.38% and DMC selectivity of 83.1% in
a fixed-bed reactor. On the basis of the kinetic experiments utilizing
an approach of the initial rate method, the reaction process and kinetics
were studied for the direct synthesis of DMC over the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst. An apparent rate
equation is given: initial rate = k · [CO2]−1· [*]−1. These
results are consistent with the prediction of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism where CO2 adsorbs directly on the catalyst surface
with the CO2 activation as the rate-controlling step. Moreover,
the activation energy barrier of the Ti0.04Ce0.96O2 nanorod catalyst is determined to be 46.3 ± 5.0
kJ/mol, which is lower than 67.9 ± 7.5 kJ/mol for neat CeO2 nanorods. However, the activation barrier of 46.3 kJ/mol
remains unsatisfying. As a consequence, we forecast that the yield
of DMC can be further improved by decreasing the activation energy
barrier required for CO2 activation, maximizing the surface
area of catalysts, and operating the catalytic process with a proper
ratio of CO2 to methanol in the feed gas.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Cerium(III) nitrate hydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O; 99.5% metal basis) was purchased
from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Titanium(IV) oxysulfate-sulfuric
acid hydrate (TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O; synthesis grade,
titanyl sulfate content 93.85%) was purchased from Macklin Biochemical
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai China). Sodium hydroxide (99.5%, AR) was obtained
from Guangdong Chemical Reagent Factory (Guangzhou, China). All of
the chemicals were used without further purification.

Catalyst Preparation
Titania-doped Ceria nanorod catalysts
with different TiO2 contents (x = 0.02,
0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10) were prepared using a modified hydrothermal
method42,57 that incorporated lyophilization to ensure
the dryness of the catalysts. Briefly, stoichiometric Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O were mixed with 40 mL of a 6 M sodium hydroxide aqueous
solution in a 100 mL Teflon liner. The liner was sealed in a stainless
steel autoclave and retained in a convection oven for 24 h at 100
°C. The solid products were centrifuged and washed with ethanol
and water several times until the supernatant became neutral. Afterward,
the presynthesized nanorods were frozen in liquid nitrogen (−196
°C) and then freeze-dried in a bulk tray dryer (Four-ring Science
Instrument Plant Beijing Corporation, Beijing, China) at a sublimating
temperature of −40 °C and a pressure of 3 mbar. Finally,
the catalysts were calcined at 600 °C under an air atmosphere
by placing on a quartz boat in the center of a Muffle furnace and
then slowly cool to room temperature. For contrast, ceria nanorod
catalysts were prepared by the same method without the addition of
TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O.

Catalyst Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) measurements were carried out on JEOL JSM-2010HR at 200 kV.
The samples were dispersed into ethanol by ultrasonication and then
dropped onto the copper grid and dried in air at room temperature.

X-ray powder diffraction was conducted on a Rigaku Dmax 2200 diffractometer.
Graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178
nm) at 40 kV/30 mA and a scan rate of 5°/min were applied in
this characterization. The grain sizes of the particles were calculated
based on the Scherrer equation.

N2 adsorption measurement
was performed on a Micrometrics
ASAP-2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus. The sample was pretreated
in a nitrogen flow at 200 °C for 2 h. When cooling to room temperature,
the sample adsorbed N2 in liquid nitrogen under a flow
rate of 110 mL/min. The parameters of the particles were calculated
from the adsorption results using the BET methods.

Inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES)
measurements were performed on an Atomscan Advantage spectrometer,
Thermo Ash Jarrell Corporation. The samples were digested by strong
nitric acid in a Teflon autoclave and then diluted by 5% nitric acid
solution. The content of TiO2 in nanorods was calculated
according to eq 1. 1  The X-ray photoelectron
spectrum (XPS) of
the sample was recorded on a ESCALAB250 (Thermo-VG Scientific) spectrometer
with a monochromatized Al Kα source at 1486.6 eV, 15 kV, and
150 w. Survey scan spectra in the 1100–0 eV binding energy
range were recorded with pass energy of 20 eV, and detailed spectra
were recorded for the sample. An estimation of the amount of Ce(III)
can be obtained from the intensity of the v0 (u0) and v′
(u′) lines according to eq 2.58,59 2  Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was
obtained on a Quantachrom Chem-BET 3000 apparatus according to the
method established in our former research.37 Samples were pretreated in nitrogen flow at 200 °C for 1 h.
After cooling to room temperature, the samples were saturated with
10%CO2/90%N2 or 10%NH3/90%N2 for 30 min under a flow rate of 60 mL/min. Then, the physically
adsorbed CO2 or NH3 was removed by streaming
with 30%N2/70% He for 2 h under a flow rate of 50 mL/min.
The samples were then heated up to 600 °C at a heating rate of
8 °C/min in N2/He. In addition, the amount of desorbed
NH3/CO2 (in mmol/g) was obtained by back-titration,
in which HCl/NaOH (0.01 mol/L) was used as the adsorbent of NH3/CO2 and NaOH/HCl (0.01 mol/L) was used as the
titrant with a mixed indicator (1% bromocresol green ethanol solution
and 2% methyl red ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1).60

Catalytic Performance Measurement
The original selection
of catalysts was conducted in a 50 mL autoclave with high-velocity
mechanical stirring. Fresh catalyst (0.2 g) and absolute methanol
(20 mL) were put into the autoclave. CO2 was purged into
the reactor and replaced the air inside several times to assure oxygen-free
reaction conditions. The initial pressure of CO2 was set
as 5 MPa, and then it was reacted at 120 °C for 5 h. The resultants
were filtrated by a PES membrane (pore size, 0.45 μm) and then
measured by GC-7900II equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).

Direct synthesis of DMC from methanol and CO2 was carried
out in a continuous tubular fixed-bed microreactor. The diagram of
the apparatus is shown as Schedule S1. Nitrogen was purged into the
tubular reactor to assure oxygen-free reaction conditions before the
catalyst bed was heated up to a set temperature. CO2 was
purged into the methanol container to get a CO2/methanol
mixed gas. The mixed gas was then charged into the reactor. The resulting
productions were measured by GC-7900II equipped with a flame ionization
detector (FID) through a six-way valve.

Further kinetics exploring
experiments were carried out in an optimized
fixed-bed reactor equipped with a high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) pump. The diagram of the apparatus is shown as Schedule S2.
Nitrogen was purged into the tubular reactor to replace the air inside.
CO2 was purged into the reactor directly. Liquid methanol
was pumped into the reactor through the HPLC pump. The resulting productions
were gathered offline and then measured by GC-7900II equipped with
a flame ionization detector (FID).
