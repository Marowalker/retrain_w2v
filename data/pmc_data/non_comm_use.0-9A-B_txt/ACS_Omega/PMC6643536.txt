A density function approach has been
used to screen an appropriate
surface modifier for oxidized coal to enhance its hydrophobicity in
a flotation process. Two oxidized coal surface models, coal–COOH
and coal–COONa, based on the substitution of 10-fused benzene
rings with COOH and COONa functional groups, have been constructed
to mimic the surface hydrophilic sites at acidic and alkaline pHs,
respectively. A nonpolar molecule and five polar candidate molecules
with different functional groups have been examined on each oxidized
coal model surface. Our present study indicates that octane is ineffective
toward increasing the surface hydrophobicity for both coal–COOH
and coal–COONa models due to its preferential adsorption on
hydrophobic aromatic sheet, although it can spontaneously bind to
the coal model surfaces at 298 K. Unlike octane, 4-pentylpyridine
will present the preferred hydrophobic conformation on both models.
However, its adsorption process is favorable energetically only on
the coal–COOH model. The optimized geometries of all four oxygen-containing
molecules (1-methoxyheptane, 1-octanol, octanal, and octanoic acid)
show that directional hydrogen bonds will be formed between their
oxygenated groups and the COOH group of coal–COOH model. This
results in the protrusion of the hydrocarbon chain toward the water
phase, which is beneficial for increasing coal surface hydrophobicity.
However, the calculated Gibbs free energies suggest that octanoic
acid is the best candidate. The adsorption of all four oxygen-containing
molecules on the coal–COONa model is a spontaneous process.
However, only sodium octanoate can be regarded as the effective surface
modifier according to its optimized adsorption conformation at alkaline
pH.

==== Body
1 Introduction
During
the coal oxidation process, the content of inherently hydrophobic
areas is decreased, whereas the content of oxygen-containing functional
groups on the coal surface, such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl
groups, is increased. These groups easily form hydrogen bonds with
water molecules, reducing the natural hydrophobicity of the coal surface.1

For industries that utilize fine coal processing,
froth flotation
is a widely used cleaning technology. The flotation behavior of coal
after oxidation has been widely investigated.2,3 It
was found that the adsorption of collector droplets at the coal–water
interface is strongly affected by the coal surface properties.4,5 Oily collectors such as kerosene and diesel oil have long been used
in coal flotation. However, the oxidized coal is difficult to float
with these oily collectors.6,7

It is evident
that the surface hydrophobicity of oxidized coals
can be improved using a polar molecule or a blend of a polar molecule
and a nonpolar oil. Harris et al.8 reported
that a much lower dosage of polyethoxylated nonylphenol was required
to achieve the same flotation performance for oxidized coals compared
to that of dodecane. Jia et al.6 proposed
that tetrahydrofurfuryl esters have the capability of restoring the
floatability of oxidized coal through the formation of hydrogen bond
with oxygen-containing functional groups on the oxidized coal surface.
Jena et al.9 found that a mixture of a
long-chain fatty acid and kerosene could promote flotation of oxidized
high-ash Indian coal. Qu et al.10 concluded
that the floatability of a Shendong low-rank coal can be enhanced
by the addition of 2-ethyl hexanol into the collector. Xia et al.11 showed that biodiesel, which contains much more
abundant fatty acids, was more effective collector than diesel. Chang
et al.12 demonstrated that a composite
collector of diesel and Triton X-100 could lead to a significant increase
in the flotation of oxidized coal compared with diesel alone. In the
above studies, the primary aim of the addition of polar molecules
is to render the oxidized coal surface hydrophobicity through the
interaction of the polar functional groups and the oxidized sites
on the coal surface. Hereafter, these polar molecules will be referred
to as coal surface modifiers.

In fact, due to the structural
differences, the adsorption strength of different types of oxygen-containing
groups on the coal surface should vary from one to another. To optimize
the effect of surface hydrophobicity, it is desirable to precisely
match a suitable surface modifier to every type of surface functional
group. What is the appropriate surface modifier for a particular type
of oxygen-containing group on the coal surface? How does the surface
modifier interact with it on the coal surface? A molecular-level understanding
about the adsorption behavior of a surface modifier on the coal surface
can provide answers to these two fundamental questions. However, because
of the complexity of the coal surface structure,13 the microscopic characterization of reagent–coal
surface interaction is very difficult. Until now, few reports in the
literature about these fundamental questions have been found.14 The screening of coal surface modifiers is still
a conventional trial-and-error method.

The purpose of our study
was to gain a general understanding about
how a range of organic molecules with various functional groups interact
with the oxidized coal models using a quantum chemical approach. For
studying the oxygenated group on the oxidized coal surface, we focus
on a carboxyl group attached to a simple coal model. The interactions
between the surface modifier and other oxygenated groups incorporated
into coal, such as phenolic and alcoholic hydroxyl groups and carbonyl
groups, are currently under investigation. This work may throw light
on the screening and design of new chemical reagents for coal flotation.

2 Quantum Chemistry Calculations
To understand the adsorption
mechanism of surface modifiers on
the coal surface at the molecular level, it is necessary to establish
a suitable model to simulate the oxidized coal surface. The structure
of coal is inherently complex and varies widely, depending on the
origin, history, and rank of the particular coal examined. The molecular
substructure of a typical bituminous coal has, on average, three or
four fused aromatic rings with pendant short chains.15 However, ring condensation in anthracite is believed to
be between 10 and 100.16 For anthracite,
few aliphatic chains and heteroatom-containing functional groups survive
in its molecule. In this study, a 10-fused benzene ring model was
chosen to represent the basic hydrophobic coal surface substructure,
which may be regarded as a simplified anthracite model. Aromatic carboxylic
acid is believed to be the major form of the carboxylic acid group
in an oxidized coal matrix.17 Therefore,
to model the local structure of the COOH site on the oxidized coal
surface, we place one COOH group on the edge of this cluster. In this
manner, a coal–COOH surface model was constructed, as presented
in Figure 1a. In alkaline
coal flotation pulp, the COOH group dissociates from the COO– group. The ion pair of COO– and Na+ could be formed when Na+ ions are abundant (for example,
the addition of NaOH, a basic pH adjuster). The Na+ ion
may form a salt bridge between COO– and the polar
molecule. On the basis of this assumption, a coal–COONa surface
model (Figure 1b) was
also constructed.

Figure 1 (a) Coal–COOH and (b) coal–COONa models
used to model
the oxidized coal surface. Gray, red, purple, and white balls represent
C, O, Na, and H atoms, respectively. Their electrostatic potentials
(ESPs) and representative extreme points (energies in kcal/mol) on
a 0.001 au molecular surface are also shown.

Six candidate model molecules were examined in this study.
As we
focus on the understanding about how different functional groups interact
with the oxidized coal surface, four polar oxygenated molecules, including
1-methoxyheptane (ether group), 1-octanol (hydroxyl group), octanal
(carbonyl group), and octanoic acid (carboxylic acid group, sodium
octanoate at alkaline pH), were used as the model modifiers. Pyridine
is a good solvent for the swelling and extraction of coal18 due to its strong adsorption and penetration
ability. Besides, it has also been proved that pyridine can form hydrogen
bond with the oxidized coal surface.19 Thus,
a molecule that contains a pyridine group may be a promising candidate
for a surface modifier for oxidized coal. In this study, we also evaluated
the interactions of a model molecule, 4-pentylpyridne, and the coal
models. It should be noted that the side chain length of all of these
molecules is approximately equal. The effect of side groups on adsorption
behavior will be considered in the further study. Finally, for comparison,
the binding effect of an octane molecule was also investigated, which
was used as a model of nonpolar collector.

All of the quantum
chemistry calculations were carried out using
the Gaussian 09 package.20 A meta-GGA M06-2X
functional,21 in conjunction with the 6-311G(d)
basis set, was used to optimize geometries. The M06-2X functional
has shown promising performance for studying main group thermochemistry
and noncovalent interactions.22 Following
the recommendations of the developers of the M06-2X functional,21 the basis set superposition error correction
has not been applied. All of the geometries were optimized using the
Berny algorithm. Single-point energy calculations were performed at
the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level. The effect of water as a solvent has
been modeled by means of the polarizable continuum model (PCM).23 In the framework of PCM, the solvent is represented
as a structureless continuum characterized mainly by its dielectric
permittivity. The molecular electrostatic potential on the van der
Waals surface (electron density = 0.001 au) was analyzed by the Multiwfn
program.24

To find the most stable
adsorption geometry for a particular molecule,
calculations were performed for various starting geometries, where
the molecule was placed on the coal model surface to promote possible
interactions between them via geometry optimization. For every modifier/coal
model system, only the most stable adsorption geometry was reported.

The adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGads) of the candidate molecule in the aqueous phase was calculated
at room temperature (298 K) and 1 atm pressure, corresponding to the
actual application conditions for coal flotation. This was determined
from  where Gsurface, Gmolecule, and Gmolecule–surface represent the total Gibbs free energies
of a clean oxidized coal surface, a candidate molecule, and a system
with the candidate molecule adsorbed on the coal surface, respectively.
A negative adsorption Gibbs free energy determined in this way corresponds
to a spontaneous process, and a larger negative value indicates stronger
interaction with the surface.

To obtain the Gibbs free energies
and confirm the nature of the
stationary points, vibrational frequency calculations have been performed
for all of the models. The thermodynamic analysis yielded zero point
energies and thermal corrections to the electronic energies due to
translational, electronic, and vibrational motions, which were used
to calculate Gibbs free energies. It was confirmed that geometries
corresponding to stable structures do not have imaginary vibration
frequencies.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Geometrical Structures
In this article,
we have chosen two models, coal–COOH (Figure 1a) and coal–COONa (Figure 1b), to represent the oxidized
coal fragments in acidic and alkaline coal pulps, respectively. The
aromatic sheet in these two models is used to represent the hydrophobic
region on the oxidized coal surface, whereas the COOH and COONa groups
are treated as the hydrophilic sites. It could be found that the atoms
of COOH and COONa groups and the aromatic sheet are coplanar in these
two models.

Figures 2 and 3 show the obtained adsorption
geometries for six candidate molecules on the coal–COOH and
coal–COONa models, respectively. For the coal–COOH model,
the most stable structure for an octane molecule adsorbed on the coal–COOH
is shown in Figure 2a. This straight-chain alkane is in direct contact with the fused
ring basal plane in a parallel orientation. However, the hydrophilic
COOH group cannot be covered by this nonpolar chain.

The preferred adsorption configurations
of four oxygen-containing
polar molecules, 1-methoxyheptane (Figure 2b), 1-octane (Figure 2c), octanal (Figure 2d), and octanoic acid (Figure 2e), were also determined. From Figure 2, it can be found that all
of these molecules can form hydrogen bonds with COOH groups present
on the model surface. The hydrogen bond exhibits strong orientation
preference.25 It has been reported that
a stable conventional hydrogen bond angle has a range of 140–180°.26 Interactions with hydrogen bond angle in the
range of 120–140° have reduced stabilization energies,
and angles below 120° are generally unlikely to correspond to
significant interactions. As shown in Figure 2, all of these four oxygen-containing polar
molecules can form stable hydrogen bonds with the COOH groups present
on the coal surface. However, unlike octane, their hydrophobic chains
cannot lie flat on the basal plane of fused rings. This can be understood
in terms of two competing energy contributions, hydrogen bond and
dispersion interaction. The stable hydrogen bonds between oxygen-containing
groups in surface modifiers and COOH group in the coal–COOH
model cause steric hindrance between the hydrophobic chains and fused
aromatic rings. For 4-pentylpyridine, the obtained geometry shows
that it acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor molecule. Its alkyl chain
also stays away from the basal plane of nonpolar aromatic fused rings.
For all of the adsorption systems, no obvious deviation was found
from planarity for the geometry of the coal–COOH model.

Next, the adsorption configurations of six candidate molecules
on the coal–COONa model were investigated, which is relevant
to the alkaline coal flotation pulp. In this situation, octane was
still adsorbed on the hydrophobic aromatic sheet region. The atom
positions of the COONa group are nearly unchanged after the adsorption
of octane. This suggests that the interaction between the COONa group
and octane is very weak. In addition to octane, 1-menthoxyheptane,
1-octanol, and octanal also lie flat on the basal plane of fused aromatic
rings (Figure 3b–d).
1-Menthoxyheptane, 1-octanol, and octanal attach to a Na site of the
model surface through their oxygen atoms in oxygen-containing groups.
As the positively charged Na+ ion acts as an electrophile,
it will seek electron density on other atoms. This leads to the association
of Na+ and oxygen atoms in the candidate molecules. Obviously,
the ion-pair association strength of Na+ and COO– of the coal–COONa model is weaker than that of the covalent
carboxylic OH bond of the coal–COOH model. Therefore, the position
of Na+ is more flexible and less directional than that
of hydrogen in the COOH group, which can be easily observed from Figure 3. As a result, the
hydrocarbon chains of 1-menthoxyheptane, 1-octanol, and octanal can
adsorb flat on the basal plane of fused aromatic rings, which maximize
the dispersion interaction. Under the conditions relevant for coal
flotation in an alkaline pH environment, similar to the case of the
coal–COOH model, we supposed that octanoic acid is deprotonated
to form sodium octanoate. Unlike octane as well as 1-menthoxyheptane,
1-octanol, and octanal, the obtained preferred adsorption geometries
of sodium octanoate and 4-pentylpyridine show that their hydrophobic
chains still stick out from the coal model.

Evidently, for all
of the studied candidate model molecules, two
distinctly different kinds of adsorption modes on the oxidized coal
surface can be identified. In model I, the molecule adheres to the
hydrophilic site of the coal surface through its polar group while
its hydrophobic end is projected away from the coal surface. In model
II, the candidate molecule binds to the hydrophobic basal surface
of coal in a parallel orientation.

3.2 Electrostatic
Potential on Molecular Surfaces
The adsorption of surface
modifiers will modify the surface characteristics,
which may influence the interaction between the coal surface and water
(i.e., the hydrophobicity of coal surface). The electrostatic interactions,
including hydrogen bonds, play dominant roles in the interactions
of the coal surface and water.27 The electrostatic
features of the coal surface can be predicted well by its electrostatic
potential (ESP) map computed on a 0.001 au molecular surface because
this map can reflect the specific feature of a molecule and is also
appropriate for studying noncovalent intermolecular interactions.28 Therefore, the ESP map of unmodified and modified
coal on the 0.001 au molecular surface is used to evaluate the effect
of coal surface modification.

First, the ESP maps of coal–COOH
and coal–COONa models were investigated. Figure 1a,b shows the calculated ESP surfaces and
representative extreme points of two oxidized coal models. It can
be seen that the hydrogen and double bond oxygen atoms of the carboxyl
acid group of the coal–COOH model have much more positive (51.14
kcal/mol) and negative (−30.58 kcal/mol) surface potentials,
respectively, than do those of the fused aromatic rings. This suggests
that these regions can easily adsorb polar molecules, like water.
For the coal–COONa model (Figure 1b), the two oxygen atoms of the carboxylate
functional group (COO–) and the Na+ ion
have strong negative (−35.55 and −31.65 kcal/mol) and
positive (134.72 kcal/mol) surface potentials, respectively, which
will result in the electrostatic association of the COO– group and the Na+ counterion in aqueous solution. In
addition, the Na+ in the coal–COONa model has stronger
ESP compared to that of hydrogen of the carboxyl acid group in the
coal–COOH model, indicating that the local polarity and hence
hydrophilicity of the coal–COONa model should be stronger than
that of the coal–COOH model.

Next, the ESP maps of octane/coal–COOH
and octane/coal–COONa
model systems were investigated (Figures 4a and S1e), which
offered an opportunity to evaluate the modification effect of coal
surface with the oily collector due to the fact that the properties
of this nonpolar molecule are similar to those of the conventional
oily collectors. Compared with those in the coal–COOH model,
it can be found that the ESP features of COOH group in the octane/coal–COOH
model remain unchanged (Figure 4a). Therefore, the hydrophobicity of the coal–COOH
model will not improve significantly after the adsorption of octane.
Similarly, the hydrophobicity of the coal–COONa model also
cannot be improved according to its ESP features (Figure S1e).

Figure 4 Electrostatic potentials and representative extreme points
(energies
in kcal/mol) of (a) octane/coal–COOH, (b) octanoic acid/coal–COOH,
and (c) 1-octanol/coal–COONa model systems on a 0.001 au molecular
surface. Gray, red, purple, and white balls represent C, O, Na, and
H atoms, respectively.

Corresponding to their adsorption modes, two kinds of ESP
maps
of coal surface could be found after the adsorption of the candidate
polar molecules. The first kind of ESP map applies to the adsorption
of 1-methoxyheptane (Figure S1a), 1-octanol
(Figure S1b), octanal (Figure S1c), octanoic acid (Figure 4b), and 4-pentylpyridne (Figure S1d) on the coal–COOH model as well as that
of sodium octanoate (Figure S1h) and 4-pentylpyridne
(Figure S1i) on the coal–COONa model
(adsorption model I), which would improve the hydrophobicity of oxidized
coal surface. The octanoic acid/coal–COOH system (Figure 4b) is a representative
case. From Figure 4b, it can be found that the strong negative ESP region is around
the two COOH groups in the octanoic acid/coal–COOH system.
After adsorption of octanoic acid, the ESP maximum (51.14 kcal/mol)
around the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid group in the coal–COOH
model (Figure 1b) disappeared.
At the same time, the adsorption of octanoic acid also weakened the
ESP value of the double bond oxygen of the COOH group of the coal–COOH
model (from −30.58 to −17.27 kcal/mol), but it increased
the ESP value of singly bonded oxygen of the studied coal model (from
−14.43 to −18.65 kcal/mol). In addition, two new ESP
minimum values emerged, around the oxygen atoms of carboxylic group
of octanoic acid. This should be attributed to the formation of hydrogen
bond. However, according to the present ESP results, it is difficult
to compare the slight difference in local hydrophilicity between the
hydrogen-bonded COOH groups in the octanoic acid/coal–COOH
system and the isolated COOH group in the original coal–COOH
model. However, this should not be a key factor to determine the hydrophobicity
of a modified coal surface. According to the optimized geometry of
the octanoic acid/coal–COOH system, the nonpolar hydrocarbon
chain of octanoic acid protruded into water solution. Meanwhile, the
associated two COOH groups are buried in the interior of octanoic
acid/coal–COOH system. In the flotation process, if an oil
droplet or an air bubble collides with this region, it will have to
interact with the exposed hydrocarbon chain. Thus, it is reasonable
to expect that the electrostatic potential of the hydrocarbon chain
will determine the surface hydrophobicity of modified coal. Obviously,
the ESP of the alkane chain of octanoic acid is very weak, just like
that of a fused aromatic sheet. Therefore, the hydrophilic site on
the coal surface is essentially converted into a hydrophobic site.
In this manner, the hydrophobic chain of octanoic acid could provide
a good hydrophobic anchor point for the oil droplet or the air bubble,
which is beneficial to coal flotation. This is applied to the adsorption
of 1-methoxyheptane (Figure S1a), 1-octanol
(Figure S1b), octanal (Figure S1c), and 4-pentylpyridne (Figure S1d) on the coal–COOH model as well as that of sodium
octanoate (Figure S1h) and 4-pentylpyridne
(Figure S1i) on the coal–COONa model.

The ESP maps of adsorption of 1-methoxyheptane (Figure S1f), 1-octanol (Figure 4c), and octanal (Figure S1g) on the coal–COONa model (adsorption model II) indicate that
this kind of adsorption mode cannot improve the hydrophobicity of
the oxidized coal surface. The 1-octanol/coal–COONa system
is a typical case. Figure 4c shows the ESP map and several extremes around the polar
region of the 1-octanol/coal–COONa system. It can be found
that Na+ in this system has a smaller ESP maximum value
(116.62 kcal/mol) as compared to that in the original unabsorbed coal–COONa
model (Figure 1b, 134.72
kcal/mol). However, a new maximum region around the hydroxyl hydrogen
of 1-octanol arises after its adsorption. In addition, the negative
ESP around two oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group became stronger.
Overall, no significant weakening of polarity around the hydrophilic
region of the 1-octanol/coal–COONa system can be observed at
all. More importantly, the polar hydrophilic region in the 1-octanol/coal–COONa
system will be exposed to the water phase. As a result, the flat adsorption
geometry of polar 1-octanol in model II cannot obviously improve the
hydrophobicity of coal in the flotation process. This analysis can
also be applied to 1-methoxyheptane/coal–COONa and octanal/coal–COONa
systems.

3.3 Gibbs Free Energies
It should be
noted that all of the geometries presented above were optimized at
0 K without consideration of the influence of temperature. The Gibbs
free energy accounts for the enthalpy contribution as well as the
entropic penalty, which is a predictor of the spontaneity of adsorption
at a certain temperature. Thus, the Gibbs free energy computed at
298 K and 1 atm was used to determine the adsorption possibility of
the candidate molecules.

Figures 2 and 3 present the adsorption
Gibbs free energy (ΔGads) for octane,
1-methoxyheptane, 1-octanol, octanal, octanoic acid/sodium octanoate,
and 4-pentylpyridine in the aqueous phase at 298 K and 1 atm pressure.
It is found that the candidate organic molecules bind to the coal–COOH
model in the order  This indicates that
among all of the above-mentioned
molecules the highest binding affinity toward the coal–COOH
model is seen for octane, and the negative ΔGads value (−0.49 kcal/mol) encourages its adsorption
on the coal–COOH model. However, its adsorption cannot shield
the COOH group present on the coal–COOH model according to
the ESP results. Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that the adsorption
of nonpolar oil cannot ineffectively improve the surface hydrophobicity
of oxidized coal, which is in agreement with the common experimental
results.6

For octanoic acid that
contains a COOH group, the negative ΔGads (−0.19 kcal/mol) indicates that its
adsorption on the coal–COOH model is spontaneous. Thus, our
calculations imply that octanoic acid should be the qualified surface
modifier for oxidized coal considering its adsorption geometry discussed
above, which is consistent with the experimental results.29 With respect to the other oxygen-containing
molecules, the ΔGads values for
those with ether, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups are positive (2.50
kcal/mol for 1-methoxyheptane, 3.97 kcal/mol for 1-octanol, and 3.99
kcal/mol for octanal). This indicates that the adsorption of those
surface modifiers that contain ether, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups
on the oal–COOH model may not be completed spontaneously at
298 K. Besides, 4-pentylpyridine that possesses a nitrogen-containing
group also can bind to the coal–COOH model although its binding
is not as strong as that of octanoic acid. On the basis of its adsorption
conformations and ΔGads value, 4-pentylpyridine
should also be effective toward shielding the COOH group on the coal
surface.

Interestingly, despite the formation of hydrogen bond
between their
oxygen-containing groups and the carboxyl acid group on the coal–COOH
model, the adsorption of all five polar candidate molecules is weaker
than that of nonpolar octane. This should be ascribed to the competing
result of hydrogen bond and dispersion interaction, as discussed above.
The oriental hydrogen bond between these oxygen-containing molecules
and carboxyl acid group incorporated into the coal model surface hinders
the dispersion interaction between their hydrophobic chains and the
aromatic sheet, resulting in their lower adsorption abilities.

Under the alkaline conditions, when the COONa group is present
on the coal surface, the adsorption strength of six selected model
molecules on the coal–COONa model is very different  The ΔGads values for all four oxygen-containing molecules are negative (Figure 3), meaning that they
can bind to the coal–COONa model spontaneously at 298 K. Unfortunately,
the adsorption configurations of 1-octanol, 1-methoxyheptane, and
octanal reveal that they cannot improve the hydrophobicity of the
coal–COONa model, as discussed in Section 3.2. Therefore, the only effective surface
modifier for the coal–COONa model is sodium octanoate. For
4-pentylpyridne, the positive ΔGads values discourage their adsorption in alkaline pH conditions. Like
the octane/coal–COOH system in the acidic conditions, the adsorption
of octane on the coal–COONa model is spontaneous. However,
its adsorption cannot improve the hydrophobicity of the oxidized coal
surface, as discussed in Section 3.2.

4 Conclusions
The
density function method has been used to screen the appropriate
surface modifier for oxidized coal flotation. It was found that the
effective modification of the COOH and COO– groups
on the coal surface by a polar molecule depends not only on the free
energy preferences of adsorption but also on the corresponding adsorption
conformation.

Without any polar groups in the molecule, octane
is ineffective
toward shielding the neutral and ionized carboxyl groups due to its
preferential adsorption on the hydrophobic region of the coal surface
despite the favorable ΔGads. When
the COOH group prevails on the oxidized coal surface, all five selected
polar model molecules can form hydrogen-bonded complexes with the
coal model. The strong orientation preference of hydrogen bond hinders
the binding of the hydrocarbon chain of the candidate polar molecules
on the coal hydrophobic region. The resulting protrusion of the hydrocarbon
chain will improve the hydrophobicity of the oxidized coal surface.
However, the calculated Gibbs free energies of adsorption evidence
that only octanoic acid and 4-pentypyridine may be able to adsorb
on the coal–COOH model in the aqueous phase at 298 K and the
adsorption of octanoic acid is energetically more favorable than that
of 4-pentypyridine. These results suggest that the molecule that contains
a carboxyl group should be the preferred surface modifier to impart
hydrophobicity toward the carboxyl site on the coal surface at acidic
pH. Under pH conditions where COONa groups exist on the oxidized coal
surface, the optimized geometries of surface modifier/coal–COONa
model systems show that the COONa group will attract the polar groups
of the candidate molecules. However, the orientation of this interaction
is less constrained than that of hydrogen bond, resulting in the binding
of hydrophobic end of 1-methoxyheptane, 1-octanol, and octanal to
the hydrophobic region of the coal model. Their adsorption geometry
cannot obviously improve the hydrophobicity of coal. From the calculated
ΔGads results, we propose that sodium
octanoate is the only qualified surface modifier.
