Liquid water is the most commonly used environmental-friendly
solvent and reactant in chemical reactions and physical processes.
Conventionally, it is considered as a passive reactant. In this work,
we investigate the potential of plasmon-activated water (PAW) with
intrinsically reduced hydrogen-bonded structures compared to normal
deionized (DI) water to serve as an active green energy resource.
The efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation of water performed
on a platinum electrode to form hydrogen peroxide is significantly
enhanced in PAW compared to that in DI water. In addition, the limiting
current density of the oxygen reduction reaction on a platinum/carbon-coated
disk electrode is also enhanced when using PAW (in 0.9 wt % NaCl or
in 0.1 M KOH). Moreover, the cell capacitance with semitransparent
platinum-coated fluorine-doped SnO2 electrodes is significantly
increased from ca. 2 × 10–9 to 6.1 × 10–7 F when decreasing the applied frequency from 10 to
0.1 Hz in a cell containing PAW instead of DI water (without the supporting
electrolyte). More interestingly, compared to that in DI water, the
efficiencies of the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acid solution
(0.05 M H2SO4) and the oxygen evolution reaction
in an alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH) performed with PAW in situ increase
by about 20% with nanoscale-granulated gold electrodes under resonant
illumination. These increases are more significant in neutral solutions
for hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.

Introduction
Due to increasing global energy consumption
and the corresponding burgeoning environmental pollution, renewable
fuels, such as hydrogen and oxygen, are being considered as clean
energy sources. Also, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an ideal
process for energy conversion as a renewable and environmental-friendly
strategy.1,2 On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a clean chemical with a wide range of applications.
The electrochemical generation of H2O2 from
water’s oxidation provides a straightforward green route.3,4 Also, efficient capacitors are important for energy storage in developing
green energies.5,6 It is recognized that platinum
(Pt) based electrode materials are the most effective catalysts for
the electrochemical production of hydrogen, oxygen, and H2O2 and for the ORR.7,8 However, the high cost
of noble Pt has spurred studies that focus on new and cheap catalysts
with different chemical compositions and structures to increase the
efficiencies of renewable energy-related reactions.9,10

The production of hydrogen and oxygen from water splitting, the preparation
of hydrogen peroxide from water, and the ORR in water all indicate
the important roles of water as a reactant and solvent. However, because
our knowledge of water’s structure on the molecular level is
limited, well-known water properties are mainly based on free bulk
water. As a result, the effects of the hydrogen-bond (HB) network
of water’s structure on the corresponding energy-related chemical
reactions have been less well reported in the literature. Actually,
the original tetrahedral HB network of bulk water can be destroyed
when liquid water is confined in a nanosized environment or localized
at the interfaces.11−13 Because
the amount of these kinds of waters is small and a dynamic HB network
exists on a picosecond time scale,14,15 there are limits
to scaling up the corresponding green technologies. Actually, the
density functional theory revealed that the interaction energy of
H3O+–OH– is 46.9 kJ
mol–1; this energy increases by ca. 2.5-fold when
H3O+ is associated with an additional four water
molecules through HBs.16 This fact promises
an alternative approach to efficient green-energy-related reactions
that utilize water molecules themselves with reduced HBs. Because
stable gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) possess well-defined localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) bands in the UV and near-IR regions,
they are commonly used in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)17,18 studies. In our previous reports,19,20 plasmon-activated
water (PAW) with reduced HBs and distinct properties was innovatively
prepared by utilizing the plasmonic absorption of light on resonantly
illuminated AuNPs. The liquid PAW thus created can be mass-produced.
Motivated by the above breakthroughs, in this work, we investigated
the potential of PAW as an active green energy resource in renewable
energy-related electrochemical reactions and electrochemical capacitors.
Moreover, we designed experiments to investigate the hydrogen
evolution reactions (HERs) and the oxygen evolution reactions (OERs)
that were performed on roughened Au electrodes under resonant illumination
to create PAW in situ to overcome decay issues of the prepared PAW.

Experimental Section
Preparations of PAW and PAW in Situ
To prepare PAW,
deionized (DI) water (at a temperature of 23.6 °C and pH 7.01)
was passed through a glass tube filled with ceramic particles onto
which AuNPs had been adsorbed under resonant illumination with green
light-emitting diodes (LEDs, with a wavelength maximum centered at
530 nm). Then, the created PAW (at a temperature of 23.9 °C and
pH 7.03) was collected in glass sample bottles for subsequent experiments
within 30 min. Then, the subsequent experiments were completed generally
in 1 h. As discussed in our previous study,20 the persistence of a metastable PAW is time-dependent (roughly linear),
as suggested from the measured ζ-potential of PAW. After the
storage of the created PAW for 2 days, its activity decayed by only
ca. 10% in magnitude. Therefore, there is no issue regarding the stability
of the created PAW used in this work. Differences in the pH and temperature
between DI water and PAW were, respectively, within 0.5 pH units and
0.5 °C for different batch experiments. In hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), PAW (or DI water)
in situ represents the active water being prepared in a PAW (or DI
water) filled glass cell containing an electrochemically roughened
Au electrode with AuNPs. In the experiments, a glass cell with water
was illuminated with green LEDs to create PAW (or DI water) in situ
at the AuNPs. To avoid a significant increase in water temperature,
the light strip was not directly pasted onto the glass cell but onto
a transparent plastic sheet that encircled the glass cell. Therefore,
the increase in water temperature remained below 1 °C. Throughout
this work, unless otherwise stated, the experiment was performed under
indoor fluorescent lamps.

Preparation
of Electrochemically Roughened Au Electrode with AuNPs
All
of the electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-compartment
cell at room temperature (24 °C) and controlled by a potentiostat
(model PGSTAT30, Eco Chemie). A gold sheet with a bare surface area
of 0.238 cm2, a 1 × 4 cm platinum sheet, and a KCl-saturated
silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode were, respectively,
employed as the working, counter, and reference electrodes. Before
oxidation–reduction cycle (ORC) treatment, the gold electrode
was mechanically polished (model Minimet 1000, Buehler) successively
with 1 and 0.05 μm alumina slurries to a mirror finish. Then,
the electrode was cycled in a deoxygenated 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution
(40 mL based on DI water) from −0.28 to +1.22 V vs Ag/AgCl
at 500 mV s–1 for 25 scans. Respective durations
at the cathodic and anodic vertices were 10 and 5 s. Finally, the
potential was held at the cathodic vertex before the roughened Au
electrode was removed from the solution and thoroughly rinsed with
DI water. The prepared substrate was dried in a dark vacuum dryer
for 1 h at room temperature for subsequent use. These ORC procedures
are generally employed in our21 and other
laboratories22,23 for SERS studies.

Results and Discussion
As shown in our
previous study,19 for examining the purity
of the prepared PAW further, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer
analyses indicated that the concentrations of the slightly dissolved
metals in the Au nanoparticle-treated (AuNT) water were ca. 0.62,
43, 25, 23, 13, 4.5, and 0.41 ppb for Au, Na, K, Al, Mg, Ca, and Fe,
respectively. Excluding Au, the total equivalent molar concentration
of these dissolved metals is equal to 6.9 × 10–6 M. This measured value is ca. 2.4 × 10–7 M
for DI water as a reference. Moreover, various blank experiments had
been carefully performed for excluding the possible case of the creation
of PAW.19 The AuNT water is the notation
for the Au nanoparticle-treated water. The AuNT water and PAW represent
the same water created using the same process, as described in this
work. The detailed discussions regarding the hot electron transfer
(HER) breaking the hydrogen bonds of bulk water and the charge-transfer
process affecting the hydrogen-bonding structure of water are shown
in our previous studies.19,20 Moreover, in our previous
work,20 a mechanism of persistence of metastable
PAW was proposed regarding the breaking of hydrogen bonds and the
occupying of hydrogen bonds. The former in a short effective distance
results from the high hot electron energy, whereas the latter in a
long effective distance results from the low hot electron energy.
Traditional methods of producing H2O2 include
anthraquinone autoxidation,24 oxidation
of alcohols, and electrochemical synthesis.25,26 However,
these are highly energy-consuming processes. Hence, a simple and green
process to synthesize H2O2 was proposed based
on photocatalysis, in which sunlight-driven production of H2O2 in water was achieved in the presence of oxygen and
graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4).27,28 In this work, we innovatively designed a more-efficient green process
using the g-C3N4 photocatalyst to produce H2O2 from DI water with reduced HBs in situ (see
the Supporting Information, SI). In the
experiments, the in situ productions of DI water with reduced HBs
(named as DI water in situ) and H2O2 were implemented
with saturated oxygen solutions to evaluate the efficiencies of H2O2 productions. Figure 1a demonstrates the idea of the in situ creation
of PAW from DI water for the efficient production of H2O2. Figure 1b shows the relationship of the optical density (OD) at 570 nm to
the reaction time under white light illumination. Meanwhile, the OD
value was proportional to the quantity of the produced H2O2. Compared to that of the blank DI water system, the
OD values based on the DI water in situ system, respectively, increased
by ca. 34, 59, 74, and 78% at sampling times of 3, 6, 9, and 12 h.
During the initial reaction, the creation of DI water with reduced
HBs did not reach a saturation state in the reaction cell. Thus, less
H2O2 was produced by the contribution of water
with reduced HBs. However, this difference became insignificant after
reacting for 9 h, indicating that the DI water in situ had reached
a saturation state with completely reduced HBs. The higher efficiency
of H2O2 production with DI water in situ could
be attributed to the catalytic activity of the plasmon-treated water
and the increased maximum content of dissolved O2.1919 Furthermore, the
weakly hydrogen-bonded DI water in situ with smaller water clusters
had an increased amount of H2O reactant. These two particular
features led to an obvious improvement in H2O2 production.

in situ creation of PAW from DI water for efficient hydrogen peroxide
production in water. (b) Hydrogen peroxide production in systems of
DI water (black square) and DI water in situ (blue circle) with time.

The ORR is a key process in renewable chemical–electrical
energy conversion.1 This process is recognized
as a four-electron electrochemical reaction as follows. 1  To accelerate
the chemical–electrical energy conversion, catalysts, like
precious metals such as Pt, are generally employed. In this work,
we report on an innovative idea for an efficient ORR that utilizes
liquid PAW with reduced HB structures instead of conventional DI water. Figure 2 shows the ORRs in
PAW-based (pH 6.36) and DI water-based (pH 5.91) saline solutions.
Electrochemical results indicated that when the electrode potential
was corrected for the pH (i.e., using a reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) scale), the onset potential of the ORR was more positive in
PAW (0.82 V vs RHE) compared to that measured in DI water (0.74 V
vs RHE; see Figure 2a). The positive shift in the onset potential of the ORR can possibly
be attributed to surface electronic structural modifications29 by the negatively charged PAW.20 In addition, the limiting current density of the ORR on
the Pt/C-coated disk electrode was also enhanced when using PAW. This
effect may have resulted from a higher diffusion rate and/or a higher
concentration of oxygen molecules dissolved in the PAW-based electrolyte
compared to DI water media.30 On the other
hand, the mean electron transfer numbers (n) of the
ORR with the Pt/C electrode in both PAW and deionized water (DIW)
were very close to 4 (see the SI for detailed
explanation), revealing that ORRs on the Pt/C electrode in both media
generally followed a four-electron transfer mechanism (Figure 2b). This phenomenon suggests
that interactions among O2, H+, H2O, and Pt atoms may determine the onset potential and the limiting
current density of the ORR in PAW. Note that the onset potential and
the limiting current density were more positive and more enhanced
in PAW-based systems regardless of the rotating speeds (Figure 2c,d).

in PAW- and DI water-based saline solutions, respectively.

Figure 3 shows the ORR in PAW-based
and DI water-based alkaline solutions containing 0.1 M KOH. The limiting
current density of the ORR on the Pt/C-coated disk electrode was also
enhanced when using PAW. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the
limiting current density of the ORR gradually decreased with the prolongation
of the residence time of PAW (Figure 3a). Similarly, the mean electron transfer numbers (n) of the ORR with the Pt/C electrode in all solutions were
very close to 4, revealing that ORRs on the Pt/C electrode in both
media generally followed a four-electron transfer mechanism (Figure 3b). Meanwhile, the
onset potential and the limiting current density were more positive
and more enhanced in PAW-based systems regardless of the rotating
speeds (Figure 3c).

PAW- and DI water-based solutions, respectively.

Figure 4 shows the
cell capacitance against the applied frequency for the same symmetrical
cell containing PAW, reverse osmosis (RO), and DI waters. From a comparison
of these three curves, there is no obvious difference when the applied
frequencies were >10 Hz. However, the cell capacitance significantly
increased from ca. 2 × 10–9 to 6.1 × 10–7 F with a decrease in the applied frequency from 10
to 0.1 Hz when the cell contained PAW. A gradual increase in the cell
capacitance from ca. 2 × 10–9 F to 4 ×
10–8 F with a decrease in the applied frequency
from 10 to 0.1 Hz was also detected when the cell contained the RO
and DI waters. The above result revealed that the cell capacitance
can be significantly enhanced from 4 × 10–8 F to 6 × 10–7 F (i.e., 15-fold) by changing
from DI water to PAW. Since the cell capacitance is directly proportional
to the dielectric constant of the medium filling the cell,31 the above interesting phenomenon indicates the
large dielectric constant of PAW. The dielectric constant of water
(εw) is a function of the water dipole moment and
the group of water molecules bound to the central water molecule 2  where μw is the dipole moment of water molecule, g is the number of water molecules in the cluster, and cos γ
is the average of the cosines of the angles between the dipole moment
of the central water molecules and the group of water molecules bound
to the central water molecules. The very large dielectric constant
of PAW is attributable to a change in the intrinsic dielectric constant
of water molecules (e.g., the negative charge on the surface of small
PAW water clusters may increase the intrinsic dielectric constant
of water molecules). Also note the significant change in the capacitance
of the above three cells at the applied frequencies of <10 Hz,
which suggests that the dipole moment rotation of PAW, RO, and DI
water clusters for enhancing the dielectric constant (i.e., electric
field shielding) may be induced by the applied electric field at the
frequencies of <10 Hz, although the lifetime of water clusters
is expected to be around 0.1 ns.31

Hydrogen is a clean fuel with a high energy density. The electrochemical
splitting of water is a green process to prepare hydrogen by the following
cathodic reaction 3  This HER is favorable
in an acidic solution. The weak hydrogen bonds of PAW encouraged us
to utilize it for efficient HERs because less energy is required to
electrolyze water.16

As shown in
our previous studies,19,20 noble-metal NPs and resonant
illumination are necessary to create PAW, and the activity of the
created PAW decreased a few days after its preparation. Moreover,
supersmall water clusters with extremely reduced HBs were obtained
by irradiating DIW-wetted ceramic-supported AuNPs with laser light
at 532 nm in an in situ Raman experiment. Thus, we designed the experiments
to be performed on roughened Au electrodes with AuNPs under resonant
illumination to create HERs with PAW in situ. Figure 5a shows linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs)
produced with DI water and PAW acidic solutions (0.05 M H2SO4) under resonant illumination with green LEDs or a
dark atmosphere. The onset potentials of the cathodic HERs were more
positive in PAW-based systems and especially with PAW in situ (the
experiment was performed using PAW and a reaction cell illuminated
with resonant light to maintain the optimum activity of PAW for the
entire HER). These results suggest that the required energy for HERs
can be reduced through a weakening of HBs. Meanwhile, magnitudes of
the recorded currents of cathodic HERs performed in the PAW-based
systems increased, compared to that performed in DI water in the dark
(the experiment was performed using DI water and a reaction cell covered
with foil paper to maintain the light-free condition for the entire
HER), especially for HERs performed with PAW in situ. Figure 5b shows the corresponding increased
efficiencies of HERs performed in different PAW-based systems compared
to the HER performed in a DI water-based system. The current was −5.92
± 0.48 mA at −0.7 V vs RHE for the HER performed in a
system of DI water in the dark. The currents were −6.02 ±
0.34 (an increase of 1.7%), −6.42 ± 0.16 (an increase
of 8.4%), and −7.07 ± 0.16 mA (an increase of 19%) at
−0.7 V vs RHE for the HERs performed in the systems of DI water
in situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ, respectively. A comparison
of the increased efficiencies for PAW in the dark and with PAW in
situ indicates that the efficiency was significantly enhanced by ca.
130% in magnitude for the HER performed with PAW in situ. Also, the
current was −11.85 ± 0.57 mA at −1.1 V vs RHE for
the HER performed in the system of DI water in the dark. The currents
were −12.41 ± 0.35 (an increase of 4.7%), −13.17
± 0.25 (an increase of 11%), and −13.98 ± 0.44 mA
(an increase of 18%) at −1.1 V vs RHE for the HERs performed
in the systems of DI water in situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ,
respectively. Similarly, this efficiency was more significantly enhanced
by ca. 60% in magnitude for the HER performed with PAW in situ compared
to PAW in the dark.

Figure S1a shows
LSVs performed on neutral DI water and PAW solutions (0.1 M Na2SO4) under resonant illumination with green LEDs
or a dark atmosphere. Similarly, magnitudes of the recorded currents
of the cathodic HERs performed in the PAW-based systems increased
compared to that performed in DI water in the dark, especially for
the HER performed with PAW in situ. Figure S1b shows the corresponding increased efficiencies of HERs performed
in different PAW-based systems compared to the HER performed in the
DI water-based system. Compared to the current at −0.7 V vs
RHE for the HER performed in the system of DI water in the dark, the
currents increased by 28, 21, and 31% at −0.7 V vs RHE for
the HERs performed in the systems with DI water in situ, PAW in the
dark, and PAW in situ, respectively. Comparing the increased efficiencies
with PAW in the dark and PAW in situ indicates that the efficiency
was significantly enhanced by ca. 50% in magnitude for the HER performed
with PAW in situ. Also, compared to the current at −1.1 V vs
RHE for the HER performed in the system of DI water in the dark, currents
significantly increased in PAW-based systems, especially with PAW
in situ. Similarly, this efficiency was significantly enhanced by
ca. 50% in magnitude for the HER performed with PAW in situ compared
to PAW in the dark. As discussed in our previous study,19 the PAW was created on the AuNPs under resonant
illumination (in light) via hot electron transfer. Thus, the PAW cannot
be created on the AuNPs in the dark.

The electrochemical OER
in water is a clean process to produce oxygen through an anodic reaction 4  Therefore, this OER
is favorable in an alkaline solution. Also, the weak hydrogen-bonded
water of PAW compared to conventional DI water should be an advantage
in the OER because less energy is required to electrolyze water.16Figure 6a shows LSVs performed on alkaline DI water and PAW solutions
(0.1 M KOH) under resonant illumination with green LEDs or dark atmosphere.
The onset potentials of the anodic OERs were more negative in the
PAW-based systems and especially for the PAW in situ (the experiment
was performed using PAW and a reaction cell illuminated with resonant
light to maintain the optimal activity of PAW for the entire OER).
These results suggest that the required energy for the OERs could
be reduced through the weakening of the hydrogen bonds of water molecules.
Meanwhile, magnitudes of the recorded currents of the anodic OERs
performed in the PAW-based systems increased compared to that performed
in DI water in the dark (the experiment was performed using DI water
and a reaction cell covered with foil to maintain a light-free condition
for the entire OER), especially for the OER performed with PAW in
situ. Figure 6b shows
the corresponding increased efficiencies of OERs performed in different
PAW-based systems compared to the OER performed in the DI water-based
system. Similar experiments, as shown in Figure 6a, were performed three times. Therefore,
the obtained values shown in Figure 6b were extracted by using the average values plus the
relative standard deviation based on these three experimental results.
The current was 5.65 ± 0.33 mA at 2.7 V vs RHE for the OER performed
in the system of DI water in the dark. The currents were 5.70 ±
0.32 (an increase of 0.88%), 6.96 ± 0.29 (an increase of 23%),
and 7.00 ± 0.09 mA (an increase of 24%) at 2.7 V vs RHE for the
OERs performed in the systems of DI water in situ, PAW in the dark,
and PAW in situ, respectively. Also, the current was 9.88 ± 0.37
mA at 3.1 V vs RHE for the OER performed in the system of DI water
in the dark. The currents were 10.02 ± 0.35 (an increase of 1.4%),
11.13 ± 0.22 (an increase of 13%), and 11.81 ± 0.36 mA (an
increase of 20%) at 3.1 V vs RHE for the OERs performed in the systems
of DI water in situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ, respectively.
A comparison of the increased efficiencies of PAW in the dark and
PAW in situ indicates that the efficiency was significantly enhanced
by ca. 50% for the OER at 3.1 V vs RHE performed with PAW in situ.

Figure S2a shows LSVs performed with
neutral DI water and PAW solutions (0.1 M Na2SO4) under resonant illumination with green LEDs or dark atmosphere.
Similarly, the magnitudes of the recorded currents of the anodic OERs
performed in PAW-based systems increased compared to that performed
in DI water in the dark, especially for the OER performed with in
situ PAW. Figure S2b shows the corresponding
increased efficiencies of the OERs performed in different PAW-based
systems compared to the OER performed in the DI water-based system.
Compared to the current at 2.4 V vs RHE for the OER performed in the
system of DI water in the dark, the currents significantly increased
by 32, 59, and 87% at 2.4 V vs RHE for the OERs performed in the systems
of DI water in situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ, respectively.
A comparison of the increased efficiencies in PAW in the dark and
PAW in situ indicates that the efficiency was significantly enhanced
by ca. 50% for the OER at 2.4 V vs RHE performed with PAW in situ.
Also, compared to the current at 2.8 V vs RHE for the OER performed
in the system of DI water in the dark, the currents significantly
increased by 33, 76, and 110% at 2.8 V vs RHE for the OERs performed
in the systems of DI water in situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ,
respectively. Similarly, this efficiency was significantly enhanced
by ca. 50% for the OER performed with PAW in situ compared to PAW
in the dark.

The HER is favored in an acidic solution, whereas
the OER is favored in an alkaline solution. Compared to DI water,
the experimental results indicated that the corresponding efficiencies
with PAW in situ increased by ca. 20% in magnitude. Although the HER
and OER in neutral solutions were relatively unfavorable according
to eqs 3 and 4, these increases were more significant in neutral
solutions for HERs (at ca. 30%) and OERs (at ca. 100%).

For
hydrogen production, the relationship between the current and the
electrolytic time at a cathodic potential of −0.8 V vs RHE
was investigated for DI water and PAW systems (0.5 M H2SO4) with and without resonant illumination. As shown
in Figure 7a, the current
in DI water in the dark very quickly reached a stable and an extremely
low value of −0.00396 ± 0.00116 mA, whereas the currents
for PAW-based systems took much longer time to achieve stable and
relatively high values. Steady currents were −0.0154 ±
0.0014 (an increase of 290% compared to that for DI water in the dark),
−0.0191 ± 0.0017 (an increase of 380%), and −0.0243
± 0.0013 mA (an increase of 610%) at −0.8 V vs RHE for
the hydrogen production performed in the systems with DI water in
situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ, respectively. A comparison
of these increased efficiencies in PAW in the dark and PAW in situ
indicated that the efficiency was significantly enhanced by ca. 60%
for the hydrogen production performed with PAW in situ. Moreover,
we supposed that ts as the steady-state
time for the recorded current was 110% of the current value at the
end in each experiment. The values of ts were 90.7 ± 4.0, 88.5 ± 0.7, and 96.5 ± 3.6 s for
the systems of DI water in situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ,
respectively. This suggests that a longer time to record a stable
current may represent a more efficient HER. For oxygen production,
the relationship between the current and the electrolytic time at
an anodic potential of 2.1 V vs RHE was investigated for DI water
and PAW systems (1 M KOH) with and without resonant illumination,
as shown in Figure 7b. Also, longer times to record stable currents in PAW-based systems
compared to the DI water system were similar. Compared to that of
the DI water system, the recorded currents increased by 3.4, 50, and
70% for the oxygen production performed in the systems of DI water
in situ, PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ, respectively. A comparison
of these increased efficiencies in PAW in the dark and PAW in situ
indicated that the efficiency was significantly enhanced by ca. 40%
for oxygen production at 2.1 V vs RHE performed with PAW in situ.
Meanwhile, the steady-state times increased by 17, 27, and 100% for
the oxygen production performed in the systems of DI water in situ,
PAW in the dark, and PAW in situ, respectively.

Figure 7 Comparison of current–time
plots of hydrogen
production and oxygen production at various applied potentials in
DI water and PAW containing different electrolytes at the same electrochemically
roughened Au electrode under illumination with green LEDs or dark
atmosphere. (a) Hydrogen production in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a cathodic potential of −0.8 V vs RHE. (b) Oxygen production
in 1 M KOH at a anodic potential of 2.1 V vs RHE.

Moreover, surface
morphologies of the electrochemically roughened Au electrodes before
and after the HERs or OERs were examined on SEM images, as shown in Figure S3. Similar images of the as-prepared
and used electrodes suggest that the roughened Au electrodes were
stable during HERs and OERs. In this work, the better results for
the electrochemical reactions have been acquired in the system of
PAW as solvent. These results come from the distinct property of PAW
with reduced HBs, as compared to conventional DI water. As discussed
in our previous study,30 the diffusion
coefficients and the electron-transfer rate constants in other electrochemical
reactions were higher for PAW system solutions compared to DI water
system solutions. Therefore, these distinct properties of PAW make
it a potentially comprehensive active green energy resource. As discussed
in our previous study,30 the diffusion
coefficients and the electron-transfer rate constants in other electrochemical
reactions were higher for PAW system solutions compared to DI water
system solutions. Higher electrochemical reaction rates (HER, OER,
and ORR) are also observed in this work. Therefore, the positive function
of PAW is universal in the electrochemical reactions/processes with
water as a solvent and an electrolyte.

Conclusions
From a basic approach of reducing HBs of water
itself, we successfully designed a system of PAW in situ to enhance
the efficiencies of various water-related green energy reactions.
Compared to those of conventional DI water, the efficiencies of HERs,
OERs, hydrogen production, and oxygen production performed with PAW
in situ significantly increased. Meanwhile, this strategy was effective
for the production of hydrogen peroxide. In the PAW systems, the ORR
was also markedly enhanced, and the cell capacitance significantly
increased. These investigations of the potential for PAW to be a comprehensive
active green energy resource are the first in the literature. These
promising systems of PAW in situ are applicable to water-related energy
fields to investigate innovative aspects of more-effective reactions.
