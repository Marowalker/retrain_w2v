Carboxyl-functionalized
graphene platelets (GP) and graphene oxide
(GO) sheets were added to a commercial aqueous adhesive dispersion
of thermoplastic polyurethane (TP) (Idrotex 200 from FacGB s.r.l.).
For both additives, the weight percentage was of industrial interest,
0.01 and 0.1 wt %. The addition of GP/GO was carried out in a simple
and scalable-up process that can be applied to other materials and
additives. Mechanical, peel tests were applied on polyurethane strips
(75 mm long, 15 mm wide, and 1.5 mm thick) prepared cutting extruded
sheets obtained using Estane 58091, a 70D aromatic polyester-based
TP. The tests with 0.01 wt % of GP showed statistically significant
higher forces at first failure and maximum forces with respect to
the pristine adhesive. Sample characterization was carried out with
scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
and thermal analysis. A mechanism is suggested for the improved performance
of the low-dose GP adhesive.

Introduction
In recent years, modern
adhesives have delivered numerous advantages
for constructors and processors alike. In particular, bonding materials
quickly and securely is a reason why in many cases their use is considered
a part of production processes.1

Synthetic thermoplastic adhesives are among the simplest forms
of adhesives to handle.2 In particular,
with respect to other types of materials, thermoplastic polyurethane
(TP) adhesives have an excellent low-temperature resistance, together
with good flexibility, toughness, and good wetting for a variety of
substrates. An important advantage of these materials is the capability
to tailor various products in order to meet different requirements
for diverse industrial applications.3

The majority of the TP adhesive market products are based on aromatic
isocyanates (e.g., methylene diphenyl diisocyanate). Aliphatic isocyanates
are also finding increased interest because of their nonyelding light
resistance.1

Essentially, these TP
adhesives are high-concentration polymer
solutions that can be spread on the surfaces to be bonded; the solvent
slowly evaporates giving a solid polymer, which forms an effective
bonded film. The surfaces are brought into contact before the solvent
evaporates completely or after the polymer has been thermally reactivated.

Key features of TP adhesive films are the crystallization degree,
the thermoplasticity, and the “open time” (time for
bonding). These properties can be combined in various ways by changing
the formulation of the TP starting material. In particular, the crystallization
degree of TP films can be tuned over a wide range of values with a
consequent increment of the hardness and the peel strength of adhesive.4

In order to influence the adhesive properties
of TP films, several
materials can be used as additives: organic molecules,5 nanoparticles (e.g., hydrophilic silica nanoparticles),6 and nanomaterials (e.g., graphene).7 For instance, adhesive nanocomposites of organically
modified montmorillonite and polyurethane have been synthesized and
their permeability to oxygen and water vapor has been measured. The
water vapor permeation through the polyurethane nanocomposites was
reduced more strongly than for oxygen, and a 50% reduction was observed
at 3 vol % silicate fraction.5

The
addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles of silica favored the
degree of phase separation between the hard (i.e., isocyanate + chain
extender) and soft (i.e., polyol) segments of the TP adhesive. The
tensile strength increased and the elongation at break of the TP adhesive
decreased by increasing the silanol content of the silica nanoparticles.6

Additives such as graphene and graphene
derivatives were used to
enhance the mechanical and thermal properties of polyurethane7−11 or to provide electrical conductivity (EC) and anticorrosion properties
of polyurethane coatings.12 Recent developments
in the field of polyurethane/graphene nanocomposite showed interesting
applications as shape memory, adsorbent, electromagnetic interference
shielding, and gas barrier materials.13

Further improvements in EC were obtained with hybrid graphene/carbon
nanotubes additives. At the same additive loading, the EC of hybrid
filler systems was significantly higher than single filler systems
(0.77 Ω–1 m–1 at 5 wt %
while the single filler system was not conductive). On the contrary,
the best anticorrosion properties were obtained with low additive
loading, which had better anticorrosion properties.12

Furthermore, a big issue that needs to be considered
is the use
of the solvent in adhesives. Recently, aqueous polyurethane dispersions
have emerged as important alternatives to their solvent-based counterparts
because of the increased awareness of health and environmental issues.14

The adhesive properties of TP dispersions
showed a decrease in
peel strength by increasing the molecular weight of polyethylenglycol.15 Moreover, solid content percentage, drying time,
and storage stability suggested fast drying and greater stability
of aqueous polyurethane dispersions.5

Choi et al.16 reported nanocomposites
of aqueous TP dispersions reinforced with functionalized graphene
sheets (up to 0.5 wt %). The preparation was carried out by casting
a suspension of graphene sheets into an aqueous polyurethane dispersion.
They observed that the addition of graphene brought some advantages
in terms of enhanced EC and thermal resistance but also a decrement
in tensile properties at high deformation (i.e., tensile strength
and elongation at break).16

The aim
of our study was to assess the improvement of the mechanical
properties obtained by the addition of a small (and hence commercially
relevant) amount of graphene to a commercial TP adhesive. More specifically,
the following hypotheses were tested.Does the addition of graphene improve the first failure
strength (defined as a drop of the force of 0.5 N) of a commercial
adhesive?

Does it increase the mechanical
energy absorbed before
failure initiation?

Does it increase
its maximal strength?



More in detail,
aqueous TP dispersions containing carboxyl-functionalized
graphene platelets (GP) and graphene oxide (GO) sheets were prepared
and their adhesive properties were measured. As the starting material,
a commercial aqueous TP adhesive dispersion (Idrotex 200 from FacGB
s.r.l.) was used. This aqueous TP adhesive dispersion was prepared
according to the acetone process.17 The
addition of the GP/GO additives was carried out having an industrial
perspective, thus applying just one step mixing to the pristine adhesive.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Idrotex 200 was kindly provided by Fac GB
s.r.l. Idrotex 200 is a 52 wt % dispersion of an alkylic polyurethane
anionomer (sulfinic) and silica particles (about 10 wt %). It was
prepared according to the so-called acetone process (ISBN 978-94-011-2924-4).
The graphene suspension of GP and GO were obtained by using G2Nan
and GO provided from Nanesa, Italy. The polyurethane strips (75 mm
long, 15 mm wide, and 1.5 mm thick) for mechanical tests were prepared
cutting extruded sheets obtained using Estane 58091, a 70D aromatic
polyester-based TP.

Composite TP Adhesive Preparation
Aqueous dispersions
of GP or GO in ultrapure Milli-Q water were prepared by vigorous mixing
of the starting materials in a concentration of 1 wt %. Aliquots of
GP or GO were added to the Idrotex 200. In a typical experiment, 20
mL of Idrotex 200 dispersion was poured in a 50 mL glass beaker and
mechanically stirred using a 1 cm magnetic stir bar rotating at 1000
rpm. GP or GO was added to the dispersion during the stirring that
ended after 30 min. The mixing was carried out at room temperature.
The composite dispersion was then bath-sonicated for 2 h in an ice
bath. Stability of the dispersion against centrifugation and aging
was investigated in order to optimize the carbon material loading
of the adhesive composition.

Samples prepared upon initial addition
of 0.01 or 0.1 wt % of GP or GO (with respect to the aqueous Idrotex
200 dispersion) were named GP0.01%, GP0.1%,
GO0.01%, and GO0.1% (Table SI1). All samples showed good homogeneity. The gray colored
suspensions, in fact, produced no precipitate upon centrifugation
at 30g for 5 min (Figure SI1), demonstrating that the carbon material had been completely, finely
dispersed. Moreover, these suspensions, GP0.01%, GP0.1%, GO0.01%, and GO0.1%, having a final
concentration of GP/GO of either 0.01 or 0.1 wt %, did not show formation
of any precipitate for six months, demonstrating a very long-term
shelf stability. On the contrary, suspensions prepared with a loading
of GP/GO > 0.1 wt % showed a tendency to stratify both during centrifugation
and in aging experiments, demonstrating unsuitability for actual application.
Mechanical properties will be analyzed only for GP0.01%, GP0.1%, GO0.01%, and GO0.1%. The
characterization of the samples was carried on by spreading the different
adhesive liquid dispersion on the surface of polyurethane strips,
using about 200 μL/cm2. The strip dimensions were
length 7.5 cm, width 1.5 cm, and thickness 1 mm. They were glued for
a length of 3.5 cm. After solvent (water) evaporation, at room temperature
and a relative humidity of less than 70%, an adhesive film was formed
with a thickness of about 150 μm. For mechanical peeling tests,
a procedure adapted from the European Standard procedure EN 1392:2006:E.
The adhesive films were heat-activated in a commercial oven at 80
°C for 15 min. This was done because heat-activated adhesives
(like Idrotex 200) do not form bonds until they are heated to a minimum
activation temperature (typically 50–100 °C). Then, we
bonded two strips by putting in contact the surfaces containing the
reactivated adhesive for 10 h under a load of 10 kg (Figure SI2).

Methods
The optical microscopy observations
of films
were made with a Leica microscope equipped with a digital camera.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a PANalytical
X’Pert Pro diffractometer, equipped with a copper anode and
a fast X’celerator counter (Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418
Å); 2θ range from 5° to 40°, step width 0.05°,
and counting time 120 s. Fourier-transform infrared spectra were collected
in attenuated total reflection (ATR–FTIR) mode using a Thermo
Scientific Nicolet iS10 FT-IR Spectrometer. Thermal gravimetrical
analysis (TGA) of a small portion of the samples (3–5 mg) was
carried out using a TA Instruments SDT 2960, at a heating rate of
10 °C/min from 30 to 600 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere (nitrogen
flow rate of 100 mL/min).

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
observations were conducted using a Phenom microscope (FEI) on uncoated
samples.

The electrical resistivity of each sample was measured
using a
four-point technique Jandel Multiheight Probe, an AMEL model 2053
potentiostat/galvanostat, and a Hewlett Packard 3478A multimeter.

Mechanical (peeling) tests were performed on polyurethane strips
(length 7.5 cm, width 1.5 cm). Pairs of strips were glued for a length
of 3.5 cm (Figures 1 and SI2). A typical T-peel test was carried
out because the bonded substrates were flexible. The experiment was
performed by anchoring the terminal 2 cm of the strips. With this
geometry, 2 cm of strip remain between the clamp and the end of the
bonded strips.

Figure 1 Photograph of a peeling test experiment. Scale bar: 1
cm.

The specimens were allowed to
season for at least 5 days at room
temperature with a relative humidity of less than 70%. The strength
of bonding was measured at room temperature using a testing machine
(model 4465, Instron Wolverhampton, UK) equipped with a 100 N load
cell. A crosshead speed of 1 mm/s was imposed, resulting in a test
duration between 20 and 50 s. N = 8 specimens were
tested for each composition.

The results of mechanical peeling
tests are reported in the force–displacement
plots (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Typical
force–displacement plot for the peel test. After
identifying the point of failure initiation (defined as a drop of
the force of 0.5 N), the following parameters were computed: force
to first failure (FFIRST FAIL), work
to first failure (WFIRST FAIL), and
maximal force (FMAX). The figure does
not report the scale on the axes as it shows a schematic profile.

These data were examined to identify
the following:(i) The point of failure initiation (defined
as a drop of the force of 0.5 N);

(ii) The force (in newton) required to
reach point of failure initiation together with the mechanical energy
(work, in joule) to reach this point;

(iii) The maximum force reached in the
test.



The work measured experimentally
includes the work required to
deform and peel the adhesives together with the work to deform (bending
and stretch) the polyurethane strips. This component can affect the
absolute value of the results but not their relative significance,
which therefore is evaluated by a statistical treatment.

In
order to analyze the significance of differences in variance
between samples, the F-test was applied. As most
differences were not statistically significant, parametric tests were
applied. The significance of the different treatments was assessed
with a one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance), with a least significant
difference post-hoc. All statistical analyses were performed with
StatPlus v6.0.3 for Mac (AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA).

Results
and Discussion
Composite TP Adhesive Structural Characterization
The
SEM images of composite TP adhesives films on polyurethane strips
are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 SEM images of films from composite aqueous TP adhesive containing
(a) GP0.01%; (b) GP0.1%; (c) GO0.01%; (d) GO0.1%; (e) pristine; and (f) surface of the polyurethane
strip. Scale bar: 5 μm.

In the absence of GP or GO, the adhesive displayed a very
compact
film that is morphologically similar to the surface of the polyurethane
strip support, as can be seen comparing Figure 3e,f. The presence of GP or GO causes an increase
of roughness of composite TP adhesive films, and this effect increases
with the concentration of GP or GO from 0.01 to 0.1 wt %, Figure 3a–c, compared
to Figure 3b–d
and Figure 3e. SEM
images also showed that a concentration of additive of 0.1 wt % lead
to a reorganization of the polymeric material in fibrous structures
that generated cavities and holes, Figure 3b–d. This textural change is more
marked in the presence of GP than GO. In addition, the images of Figure 3 demonstrated that
the presence of GP or GO additives favors the aggregation of the silica
nanoparticles (contained in the adhesive formulation), which appear
as bright particles. All these observations could be justified considering
a change in the drying mechanism of the adhesive induced by the presence
of GP or GO, to which it could be associated a structural re-organization
of the TP fibers and a phase separation. To evaluate if these changes
in the textural organization were associated to a structural reorganization
of the polyurethane fibers, the composite adhesive films were also
investigated by ATR–FTIR spectroscopy and XRD. In Figure 4 the ATR–FTIR
spectra were reported.

Figure 4 ATR–FTIR spectra of films from aqueous composite
TP adhesive
containing (a) GP0.01%; (b) GP0.1%; (c) GO0.01%; (d) GO0.1%; (e) pristine; and (f) surface
of the polyurethane strip.

They showed the typical absorption bands corresponding to
the hard
segments and to soft segments groups of polyurethanes.18 The main ATR–FTIR absorption bands are
reported and assigned in Table SI2. No
band shifts was observed, and only small differences in the relative
intensity of absorption bands in the region 3000–2800 and 1200–900
cm–1 were detected. These changes could be associated
to a minimal reorganization of soft segments, also considering the
observations of fibers by SEM only in the presence of GP0.1%, or GO0.1%. However, the absence of the ATR–FTIR
band shift suggests that the interactions among the functional groups
of the TP have not been altered by the addition of GP or GO. This
observation on the unaffected TP structural organization was further
supported by the analysis of the XRD patterns of the adhesive samples
containing GP0.01%, GP0.1%, GO0.01%, or GO0.1%. They were very similar to the one of the
reference TP adhesive, which was GP/GO-free. These patterns showed
a broad reflection centered around 2θ = 20°, suggesting
that the starting material is mainly in an amorphous state, and several
sharp diffraction peaks (Figure SI3) that
have been indexed according to the diffraction of cristobalite.19 Differently, the thermal properties of the adhesives
changed when GP or GO was present, as shown by the analyses of the
TGA profiles of the composite adhesives and of the pristine one (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Thermal analyses of the
composite TP adhesive containing (a) GP0.01%; (b) GP0.1%; (c) GO0.01%; (d) GO0.1%; and (e)
pristine.

The main weight loss event, which
for the pristine adhesive and
the GP0.01% or GO0.01% occurs at about 370 °C,
is increased at about 398 °C in the presence of GP0.1% or GO0.1%. That endothermic event has an enthalpy around
550 J/g for the pristine material and the GP0.01% or GO0.01%, which decreases to about 450 or 490 J/g in the presence
of GP0.1% or GO0.1%, respectively.

This
result may indicate that at the lower concentration GP or
GO disperse among TP fibers without affecting their organization,
the enthalpy of pyrolysis and the temperature of pyrolysis do not
change, in agreement with SEM observations and ATR–FTIR and
XRD investigations. On the contrary, when a high concentration of
GP or GO is present, the main effect of GP and GO appears to be on
the microfibrillar organization of TP, with a reduction of the enthalpy
of pyrolysis and an increase of the temperature of pyrolysis, in accord
with the SEM observations.

The samples did not show any conductivity,
which indicates that
the low concentrations of GP and GO present in the composite TP adhesive
do not result in percolation conductivity.

Composite TP Adhesive Mechanical
Characterization
All
the specimens exhibited a similar trend during the peel test, with
a monotonic trend up to the initiation of failure, followed by a marked
drop and a subsequent new increase of the force (Figure 2).

The composition had
a significant effect both on the force to initiate failure (FFIRST FAIL, ANOVA p =
0.015) and on the maximal force (FMX,
ANOVA p = 0.019). However, there was no influence
of the composition on the work to initiate failure (WFIRST FAIL, ANOVA p = 0.054).

Figure 6 presents
barcharts with p-values that show the following:The force to initiate failure (FFIRST FAIL) was significantly higher for
both percentages
of GP, compared to the pristine adhesive (respectively 1.65 and 1.87
times). Remarkably, the lower 0.01% of GP was also significantly stronger
than the higher 0.1%. Conversely, addition of GO caused a nonsignificant
variation of FFIRST FAIL, with a
slight increase and a slight decrease for the 0.1 and 0.01% additions,
compared to the pristine adhesive. The GP0.01% was also
significantly stronger GO0.01%. The interspecimen variability
for the FFIRST FAIL was similar (F-test, p > 0.05) for all the compositions
both in terms of standard deviation and as a coefficient of variation
(ratio between standard deviation and mean value).

When the maximum force (FMAX) was considered, addition of both percentages of GP significantly
increased the strength, compared to the pristine adhesive (respectively
1.36 and 1.76 times). Remarkably, the lower 0.01% of GP was again
stronger than the higher 0.1% (but this difference was not statistically
significant). Addition of GO caused a slight increase and a slight
decrease of FMAX for GO0.1% and GO0.01%, compared to the pristine adhesive (this
effect was not statistically significant). The GP0.01% was
also significantly stronger GO0.01%. The interspecimen
variability for the FMAX was slightly
larger for GP0.01% and GO0.1% than for the pristine
adhesive (F-test, p = 0.029 and
0.015 respectively). Similar interspecimen variability was observed
for all other compositions (F-test, p > 0.05).

The largest work to first
failure (WFIRST FAIL) was found with
a GP0.01%:
this was larger than for the pristine adhesive, and for GP0.1%. The work for GO0.1% was slightly larger than the pristine
adhesive, whereas GO0.01% required the minimum amount of
energy. All such differences for WFIRST FAIL were not statistically significant. The interspecimen variability
for the WFIRST FAIL was similar for
all the compositions both in terms of standard deviation and as a
coefficient of variation (ratio between standard deviation and mean
value), the GP0.1% and GP0.01% being slightly
more repeatable than all the others (F-test, p > 0.05).



Figure 6 Comparison of the mechanical
properties for the different compositions:
(a) force to reach the first failure (FFIRST FAIL); (b) maximum force throughout the test (FMAX); and (c) work to reach the first failure (WFIRST FAIL). The one-way ANOVA indicated an overall
significance of the effect of the composition on the force to first
failure and maximal force, but not for the work to first failure.
Consequently, the significance of differences between pairs is reported
where the post-hoc test indicated a significant difference; the p-values are not indicated when p >
0.1.

The rationale for the different
behavior in the presence of GP
and GO can be addressed considering their diverse chemical structure
and capability to affect the polyurethane fiber organization. In the
case of GP, the strength increases for the 0.01 wt % composite. As
the mass fraction is increased further, the strength falls to lower
values. This behavior is typical for composites and is usually explained
by aggregation effects.20−22 Almost identical behavior was
recently observed for composites of polyurethane reinforced with functionalized
nanotubes.23 The reduction in strength
was explained in terms of interactions between the nanotubes and the
polyurethane soft segments, resulting in failure at lower stress.
In the case of GO, on the contrary, the oxygen containing groups have
been reported to interact with the carbonyl group from the hard segment
of the polymer chain causing a disruption of hydrogen bonding of polyurethanes.24 This effect dominates at 0.01% loading causing
a decrease of the mechanical performances.

The beneficial effect
of GP on the mechanical properties of the
adhesive finds justification from the thermal, spectroscopic, and
morphological observations, all suggesting an incorporation GP within
the TP adhesive. This has to increase the chemical compatibility between
the composite TP adhesive and adherent surfaces, probably due to the
cumulative effects of intermolecular interactions between the GP and
TP networks, leading to a significant increase of the force to reach
first failure and the maximum force in comparison with the corresponding
joints with unfilled adherents.

In addition, the data reported
in Figure 6 indicate
that the increase of the concentration
of GP and GO by a factor of 10 (from 0.01 to 0.1 wt %) causes a decrease
of the force to the first failure and of the maximum force. This is
likely due to the agglomeration of GP and GO causing heterogeneity
in large domains at the interface between adherents and composite
TP adhesives. Accordingly, the SEM observations show that the higher
concentration of GP and GO makes inhomogeneity (presence of cavities)
in the composite TP adhesive film coverage. The influence of aggregation
effect of graphene on the mechanical properties of nanocomposite polymers
has been investigated.25,26 Interfacial interactions between
polymers and graphene-based materials play a key role in the mechanical
integrity of the corresponding nanocomposite and their mechanical
performance.27 A fine control of dispersion
and distribution of the graphene nanofillers ensures the optimal exposure
of the graphene surface to the polymer matrix and an effective reinforcement
of the mechanical properties.25 Once dispersed,
the graphene large surface to-volume ratio might result in high binding
efficiency, but strong interfacial binding can alter the macromolecular
conformation in the vicinity of the filler surface.28,29 Thus, the addition of an appropriate amount of graphene into an
adhesive formulation causes a significant improvement in the mechanical
performances. The reinforcement effect generated by the graphene is
due to the improvement of the attractive interactions between the
adhesive matrix and the dispersed graphene sheets. On the opposite,
the addition of an excessive amount of graphene is deleterious for
the mechanical properties because graphene sheets start to aggregate
into the matrix, forming heterogeneous domains that degrade the mechanical
properties of the composite.

Overall, the above observations
indicate a favorable effect of
low concentrations of GP, and also GO, on some mechanical performances
of the commercial Idrotec 200 adhesive.

These data are in line
with previous studies showing that the peculiar
properties of GP and GO sheets, among which there is high mechanical
resistance, electric conduction, and high surface area, have been
exploited in many industrial areas. In this case, the GP peculiarities
are used to improve two mechanical properties of composite TP adhesive,
of crucial importance for several applications (e.g., textile and
footwear industry).

GP and GO have been already used as additives
in epoxy-,20,30 polyvinyl acetate-,31 and polyurethane16-based adhesives. Epoxy adhesive based on tetraglycidylmethylene
dianiline filled with graphene at a concentration of 1 wt % significantly
enhanced the mechanical behavior of the bonded joints. The inclusion
of 4 wt % graphene did not have a significant effect on the mechanical
performance.20 While polyvinyl acetate
containing of 0.1 vol % of exfoliated graphene increased 50% in stiffness
and a 100% in tensile strength.31

It is important to emphasize that GP and GO have been added to
commercial aqueous TP dispersions (Idrotex 200, FacGB s.r.l.). The
synthesis of the composite TP adhesives is simple, based on commercially
available materials and easy to scale-up. All the processes are carried
out in water dispersions, making them environmentally attractive and
suitable to the principles of the green chemistry. Furthermore, the
low concentrations of GP and GO additives used in the samples make
the final product economically interesting.

Conclusions
This research fits well in the context of new aqueous adhesives
based on polyurethane, which having a growing commercial interest32 is a theme that gathers attention both for basic
and applied science. The experimental data show that the addition
of a concentration of GP as low as 0.01 wt % to Idrotex 200 allows
to obtain a significant increase of first failure and maximum force
in mechanical peeling tests. Interestingly, a less marked effect was
obtained using GO or increasing the concentration of GP/GO to 0.1
wt %. The addition of GP/GO is a simple and scalable-up process that
can be applied to other materials and additives.
