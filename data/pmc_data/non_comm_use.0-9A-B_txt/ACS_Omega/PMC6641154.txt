The
homogeneous transfer hydrogenation of benzonitrile with 2-propanol
or 1,4-butanediol produced N-benzylidene benzylamine
(BBA, 85% yield) using 5 mol % [Ni(COD)2] as a catalytic
precursor and a mixture of Cy2P(CH2)2PCy2 and Cy2P(CH2)2P(O)Cy2 as ancillary ligands, under mild reaction conditions (120
°C, 96 h, tetrahydrofuran). 1,4-Butanediol performed better than
2-propanol as a hydrogen donor and yielded γ-butyrolactone as
the product of transfer dehydrogenation. Selectivity toward dibenzylamine
(DBA, 62% yield) was achieved by varying the amount of 1,4-butanediol
in the catalytic system. A reaction mechanism was proposed, involving
a ligand-assisted O–H bond activation, end-on substrate coordination,
and a key dihydrido-Ni(II) intermediate, leading to the in situ formation
of primary imines and amines to ultimately yield the secondary imines
observed.

Introduction
The catalytic hydrogenation
of nitriles is a reaction with a high
atom economy to synthesize amines and Schiff bases.1 Because of the extended use of these derivatives as starting
materials for pharmaceuticals, fungicides, agrochemicals, dyes, fragrances,
and plastics,1a,1b the catalytic hydrogenation of
nitriles is an active field and has been reviewed recently.1c,1d This reaction is challenging in terms of selectivity (Scheme 1). The formation of primary
imine intermediates (a) combined with primary amines (b) leads to
the production of secondary imines (c), which undergo further hydrogenation
to yield the corresponding secondary amines (d).

Scheme 1 Hydrogenation of
Nitriles
Selectivity control
has mainly focused on primary amines, and in
homogeneous catalysis, most of the reports used Ru complexes for this
purpose.1c,1d Exploiting the use of earth-abundant metals,2 Beller and Milstein pioneered the synthesis of
primary amines with Fe,3a−3c Co,3d and Mn3e PNP and NNP pincers and Co3f phosphino complexes. Reports on the selective
homogeneous partial hydrogenation of nitriles to yield secondary imines
are scarce and comprise the use of Ru catalysts by Sabo-Etienne,4a Milstein,4b and Prechtl4c and W and Mo PNP pincers by Berke.4d Our group reported the hydrogenation of benzonitrile
(BN) to selectively yield N-benzylidene benzylamine
(BBA) using [(iPr2P(CH2)2PiPr2)Ni(H)]2 as a catalytic precursor.5

Hydrogenation with hydrogen gas generates no residues in stoichiometric
amounts; however, safety and environmental concerns arise with it.
Transfer hydrogenation (TH) allows using hydrogen-donating molecules
that are easily available and safe to handle.6 The catalytic TH of nitriles yielding primary amines was achieved
using Pd/C,7a NiPd alloy nanoparticles,7b and CuNi nanoparticles7c with either HCOOH/NEt3 or ammonia borane adduct (AB).
Co-Supported catalysts allowed for the synthesis of both primary amines
and secondary imines with isopropyl alcohol.7d The homogeneous Ru-catalyzed TH with 2-butanol led to primary amines8a and that with 2-propanol produced N-isopropyl8b and N-isopropylidene-amines.8c−8e These N-substituted products were also obtained with the heterogeneous
Raney Ni TH from 2-propanol.8f The use
of soluble Co pincers with AB selectively yielded primary, secondary,
and tertiary amines.8g

1,4-Butanediol
is a hydrogen source whose production from biomass
derivatives has been reported recently.9 Its dehydrogenation yields γ-butyrolactone (GBL) along with
two H2 units (Scheme 2).10 Lactones are an important
functional group as they occur in natural products and polymer synthesis.11 Thus, it has been reported that their synthesis
by catalytic (transfer) dehydrogenation of diols is also an environmentally
friendly protocol.12

Scheme 2 Dehydrogenation of
1,4-Butanediol
Regarding the TH from
1,4-butanediol to BN, there is only one example
in the literature, in which a dihydrido-Ru-NHC complex (5 mol %) catalyzed
nitrile and diol conversion to benzylamine and GBL, respectively,
to undergo further condensation, followed by dehydrogenation, to yield N-phenyl succinimide.13 In recent
years, our group has been interested in the catalytic TH of the unsaturated
compounds using low-valent Ni complexes and both amines and alcohols
as hydrogen donors.14 To the best of our
knowledge, there are no reports on the use of low-valent Ni species
in the homogeneous TH of nitriles with the use of 2-propanol or 1,4-butanediol.
Herein, we report a novel methodology to yield BBA by the Ni-catalyzed
TH of BN with both 2-propanol and 1,4-butanediol as the hydrogen source.

Results
and Discussion
The TH of a benchmark BN was first assessed
with an excess of 2-propanol
as the hydrogen source in the presence of 5 mol % [Ni(COD)2] (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) and a mixture of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 (dcype = 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane; dcypeO = dcype
monoxide; and dcypeO2 = dcype dioxide) in a [Ni(COD)2]/dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 3:3:2:1 ratio as a catalyst
precursor (1) (Scheme 3). Under these optimized conditions, we observed 88%
conversion of BN with 97% selectivity toward the formation of secondary
imine BBA (85% yield). Notably, in this catalytic system, the formation
of both N-alkenyl and N-alkylated byproducts was prevented almost
completely. Such species are formed by the condensation of primary
amines with acetone, which is produced by the transfer dehydrogenation
of 2-propanol. Additionally, the secondary amine formation [i.e.,
dibenzylamine (DBA)] was also negligible.

Scheme 3 Ni-Catalyzed TH of
BN with Excess 2-Propanol
Encouraged by this result, we switched the hydrogen source
to less
explored 1,4-butanediol, reacting an excess of it with BN (Scheme 4). In this case,
the quantitative conversion of nitrile was observed after 94 h, with
a selectivity of 62% toward the formation of DBA. This reaction was
monitored by analyzing the conversion and selectivity using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) at regular time intervals (Figure 1). During the first 23 h, BBA
was formed as the only product in 63% yield. In the next 71 h, the
secondary imine was gradually hydrogenated to yield DBA, reaching
the highest conversion of BN and a maximum yield of 62% for the secondary
amine, limited by the appearance of other byproducts.15 In view of this, we lowered the amount of 1,4-butanediol
used for the TH. Compared with the use of excess 1,4-butanediol (Table 1, entry 1), this change
enhanced the selectivity, up to 97%, selective to the production of
BBA (85% yield) after 96 h (Table 1, entry 2).

d 1,4-Butanediol-d2 was used.

Comparison between 2-propanol
and 1,4-butanediol shows that 1,4-butanediol
is a more efficient hydrogen donor because the same BN conversion
and selectivity toward BBA were achieved using a BN to 1,4-butanediol
1:1 molar ratio (Table 1, entry 2), whereas for 2-propanol, a 1:20 ratio, relative to BN,
was used (Scheme 3).
At this point, we reasoned that the in situ formed benzylamine (vide
supra) might also participate in the TH process. Without adding 2-propanol
or 1,4-butanediol, external benzylamine was reacted with BN in a 1:1
molar ratio (see Scheme 5). After 96 h, BBA was found to be the major component of the reaction
mixture. BN and benzylamine were also quantified, thus showing that
BBA might indeed be formed both by the condensation of in situ produced
primary imine with benzylamine and by the oxidative self-coupling
of benzylamine. We then used a stoichiometric 1,4-butanediol to BN
ratio, but it turned out to be detrimental for the conversion of BN
(Table 1, entry 3),
thus showing that a slight excess of 1,4-butanediol is required to
have an optimal performance and also that the in situ formed benzylamine
is not an efficient hydrogen donor in the presence of 1,4-butanediol.
Thus, the main role of benzylamine is to act as a nucleophile carrying
out the condensation reaction needed to produce the observed BBA (vide
infra).

Scheme 5 Ni-Catalyzed TH of BN with Benzylamine
To provide insight into the nature of the hydrogen transfer
from
1,4-butanediol, we performed a 1H NMR monitoring of the
Ni-catalyzed reaction between BN and 1,4-butanediol in a 1:1 molar
ratio (Figure 2). The
integration of signature signals for BBA (δ 8.41)16a and GBL (δ 4.22)16b accounted for an approximate 1:3 proton ratio through all
over the reaction time. Given the coefficients of the balanced redox
reaction shown in Figure 2, these integration values are consistent with a simultaneous
production of both BBA and GBL, thus discarding a dehydrogenation/hydrogenation
pathway and demonstrating that an actual TH takes place. The final
product of the hydrogen source is GBL, which is produced after formally
losing two H2 units from 1,4-butanediol by transfer dehydrogenation.
We observed 74% conversion of BN with 100% selectivity toward BBA
using GC–MS analysis of the final reaction crude. This was
in good agreement with the previously observed 85% chromatographic
yield for the model reaction.17

Figure 2 1H NMR (300 MHz, THF-d8)
monitoring of the Ni-catalyzed TH of BN with 1,4-butanediol.

Control tests were assayed excluding
[Ni(COD)2], dcype,
dcypeO, or dcypeO2 out of the reaction mixture, observing
a significant loss in the catalytic activity when no [Ni(COD)2], dcype, or dcypeO was added (Table S1). Importantly, no inhibition of the catalytic activity occurred
upon the addition of a mercury drop to the model reaction, consistent
with a homogeneous behavior of the system (Table 1, entry 4). Additionally, with the use of
deuterated 1,4-butanediol (1,4-butanediol-d2) bearing terminal O–D moieties, the yield of BBA remained
unchanged (Table 1,
entry 5), but a mixture of isotopologues was detected using an EI–MS
analysis (i.e., BBA + BBA-d1, Table S2). Given these facts, no kinetic isotope
effect is due to the use of O–D fragments; therefore, in the
mechanistic proposal displayed in Scheme 6, O–H/D bond activations (a,g) are
not rate-determining nor the insertions into Ni–H/D bonds (e,k)
or reductive eliminations from a Ni–H/D-type intermediate (f,m),
as they all involve such an isotope. Thus, in the current system,
β-hydride eliminations (b,h) should be rate-determining. On
the other hand, the unselective incorporation of deuterium into the
carbonated skeleton of BBA accounts for a dihydrido-Ni(II) intermediate,
which, according to Scheme 6, is formed by the oxidative addition (a,g) of the O–H/D
bonds to Ni(0) followed by β-hydride elimination (b,h) from
the corresponding alkoxo-ligand.

Scheme 6 Mechanistic Proposal for the TH of
BN with 1,4-Butanediol
With regard to the influence of the substrate electronic
properties,
we carried out the reaction of p-methoxy BN and p-trifluoromethyl BN with 1,4-butanediol (Scheme 7). We observed a preference
for the nitrile bearing an electron-releasing substituent, for which
the reaction exhibited 80% yield at a lower time (72 h) than that
required for BN to produce 85% BBA (96 h). On the contrary, this TH
became more sluggish for the electron-withdrawing-substituted nitriles
as only 30% yield of secondary imine was reached after 168 h.

Scheme 7 Influence of Electronic Properties on the TH of BN with 1,4-Butanediol
These experimental observations
fit well with the proposal given
in Scheme 6, invoking
a dihydrido-Ni(II) intermediate to which nitrile end-on coordinates
(d). The more coordinating the nitrile, the more probable the insertion
reaction into a Ni-hydride-type bond (e). The same stands for the
in situ formed primary imine to yield the corresponding primary amine
(j,k). The in situ generation of both primary imine and amine allows
for the formation of secondary imines by condensation with the corresponding
extrusion of ammonia (n). The simultaneous production of GBL (vide
supra) is consistent with two dehydrogenation steps: one yielding
an aldol (b) that undergoes 5-exo-trig cyclization to the corresponding
lactol (c) and the other in which hemiacetal oxidizes to the lactone
(g,h).

With regard to the role of dcype and dcypeO, because
these two
species are involved in the TH (Table S1), we reasoned that dcype acts as an ancillary ligand because its
strong σ-donor character favors key activation of the hydrogen
source by oxidative addition and stabilizes the Ni(II) intermediates
invoked in the catalytic cycle (Scheme 6). With regard to the role of dcypeO in the TH, given
the high hydrogen-bond-accepting character of the P=O moiety,
better than that of ethers or tertiary amines,18 such species might promote O–H bond cleavage. We
thus found it reasonable to use only dcypeO2 instead of
dcypeO; nevertheless, a significant decrement in the catalytic activity
was observed, producing 5% BBA (Table S1, entry 4). In view of this, we propose that dcypeO also acts as
a monodentate ligand, bound to Ni(0) through its trivalent phosphorus
atom. All in all, dcypeO behaves as a labile ligand, allowing for
the coordination of nitrile to the Ni(II) centers and promoting 1,4-butanediol
and hemiacetal activation onto the Ni(0) species (Scheme 8).

Scheme 8 Proposal for the
Activation of the Hydrogen Source
Conclusions
We successfully performed the selective
synthesis of BBA by the
catalytic homogeneous TH of BN with 2-propanol or 1,4-butanediol under
mild reaction conditions (120 °C, 96 h) using 5 mol % [Ni(COD)2] as a catalytic precursor along with a mixture of dcype and
dcypeO ligands. A significant excess of 2-propanol could be readily
replaced by 1,4-butanediol in a slight excess to achieve the very
same performance for both catalytic systems (88% conversion of BN
and 97% selectivity for BBA). GBL was shown to be the final product
of 1,4-butanediol, proving that this dehydrogenates irreversibly,
which accounts for its better performance. The added amount of 1,4-butanediol
allowed us to control selectivity either toward BBA (85% yield), whether
used in a BN to 1,4-butanediol 1:1 molar ratio, or DBA (62% yield)
in a 1:11 ratio. Control tests, assays with p-substituted BNs, isotopic
labeling, and the use of external benzylamine provided mechanistic
insights, which stand for dcypeO-assisted O–H bond activation
and a key dihydrido-Ni(II) intermediate, leading to the in situ formation
of primary amines and imines to ultimately yield secondary imines.
Current studies are underway in our group to develop novel Ni-based
catalytic settings for related selective nitrile TH reactions.

General Considerations
Unless otherwise noted, all
manipulations were performed using standard Schlenk techniques in
an inert-gas/vacuum double manifold or under an argon atmosphere (Praxair
99.998) in a MBRAUN UNIlab Pro SP glovebox (<1 ppm H2O and O2). All liquid reagents were purchased as reagent
grade and degassed before use. 1,4-Butanediol was stored in the glovebox
over 3 Å molecular sieves. Anhydrous BN, p-trifluoromethyl
BN, p-methoxy BN, [Ni(COD)2], and 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane
were purchased from Aldrich and stored in a glovebox for their use.
Regular THF and isopropyl alcohol (J. T. Baker, reagent grade) were
dried, distilled from sodium/benzophenone and magnesium/iodine, respectively,
and stored in the glovebox before use. Deuterated solvents were purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories and stored over 3 Å molecular
sieves for 24 h before use. NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature
on a 300 MHz Varian Unity spectrometer.

1H chemical
shifts (δ/ppm) are reported relative to the residual proton
resonance of the solvent THF-d8 3.58 (s),
1.73 (s); CDCl3 7.26 (s). 31P{1H}
NMR chemical shifts (δ/ppm) are reported relative to external
85% H3PO4. Coupling constants (J values) are given in hertz. The following abbreviations are used
for the NMR data: s = singlet; d = doublet; t = triplet, m = multiplet,
and br = broad. GC–MS determinations were performed using an
Agilent Technologies G3171A equipped with the following column: 5%
phenylmethylsilicone, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm.

Preparation of the Mixture dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2
In the inert-gas/vacuum double manifold, 5 μL of H2O2 (30% v/v) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring
to a THF solution of 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane (100 mg,
0.24 mmol). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure immediately
after the addition, and the remaining white solid was dried under
vacuum for 4 h. 31P{1H} NMR (121 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm) dcypeO2: 50.2 (s); dcypeO 49.2 (d, 3JPP = 38 Hz), 3.5 (d, 3JPP = 38 Hz); dcype 2.5 (s). Upon NMR
analysis, a mixture of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 in the molar
ratio of 3:2:1 was obtained.

Use of 1 as a Catalytic Precursor
in the TH of
BN with Excess 2-Propanol
In the glovebox, a mixture of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 in the molar ratio of 3:2:1 (6 mg, 7 μmol dcype, 4
μmol dcypeO, and 2 μmol dcypeO2) was dissolved
in THF and added dropwise to [Ni(COD)2] (2 mg, 7 μmol)
under stirring. To this mixture were added THF solutions of BN (14.8
mg, 0.14 mmol) and 2-propanol (172.4 mg, 2.9 mmol). In a THF total
volume of 1 mL, the reaction mixture was transferred to a Schlenk
tube and heated at 120 °C in an oil bath under continuous stirring.
After 96 h, the crude reaction mixture was exposed to air, and 1 μL
of aliquot was analyzed using GC–MS.

Use of 1 as
a Catalytic Precursor in the TH of
BN with 1,4-Butanediol
In the glovebox, a mixture of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 in the molar ratio of 3:2:1 (6 mg) was dissolved in THF and
added dropwise to [Ni(COD)2] (2 mg) under stirring. To
this mixture were added THF solutions of BN (14.8 mg, 0.14 mmol) and
1,4-butanediol (either 12.9 mg, 0.14 mmol; 142.3 mg, 1.6 mmol; or
9.7 mg, 0.11 mmol). In a THF total volume of 1 mL, the reaction mixture
was transferred to a Schlenk tube and heated at 120 °C in an
oil bath under continuous stirring. After 96 h, the crude reaction
mixture was exposed to air, and 1 μL of aliquot was analyzed
using GC–MS.

Homogeneity Test with 1 as a

In the glovebox, a mixture
of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 (6 mg) was dissolved in THF and
added dropwise to [Ni(COD)2] (2 mg) under stirring. To
this mixture were added THF solutions of BN (14.8 mg, 0.14 mmol) and
1,4-butanediol (12.9 mg, 0.14 mmol). In a THF total volume of 1 mL,
the reaction mixture was transferred to a Schlenk tube, and a drop
of distilled mercury was added. After heating for 96 h at 120 °C
in an oil bath under continuous stirring, the crude reaction mixture
was exposed to air and filtered to remove Hg, and 1 μL of aliquot
was analyzed using GC–MS.

1H NMR Monitoring
of the TH of BN with 1,4-Butanediol
In the glovebox, a mixture
of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 (6
mg) was dissolved in THF-d8 and added
dropwise to [Ni(COD)2] (2 mg) under stirring. To this mixture
were added THF-d8 solutions of BN (14.8
mg, 0.14 mmol) and 1,4-butanediol (12.9 mg, 0.14 mmol). In a THF-d8 total volume of 1 mL, the reaction mixture
was transferred to a Wilmad tube equipped with a J. Young valve. A 1H NMR spectrum of this just prepared mixture was acquired
at room temperature (t = 0 h trace in Figure 2). Then, the tube was heated
at 120 °C in an oil bath during successive time intervals of
24 h (t = 24 and 48 h traces) and 48 h (t = 96 h trace). After each interval, the corresponding 1H NMR spectrum was acquired at room temperature. 1H NMR
(300 MHz, THF-d8, δ/ppm) benzonitrile:
7.48–7.72 (m); 1,4-butanediol: 3.46–3.58 (m), 1.49–1.59
(m); BBA: 8.41 (t), 7.71–7.81 (m), 7.30–7.41 (m), 4.77
(br); GBL: 4.21 (t), 2.20–2.37 (m). In addition, after completing
96 h of heating, the crude reaction mixture was exposed to air, and
1 μL of aliquot was analyzed using GC–MS.

TH of p-Methoxy Benzonitrile (MeOPhCN) and p-Trifluoromethyl
Benzonitrile (CF3PhCN) Using
Precatalyst 1 and 1,4-Butanediol
In the glovebox,
a mixture of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 in the molar ratio of
3:2:1 (6 mg) was dissolved in THF and added dropwise to [Ni(COD)2] (2 mg) under stirring. To this mixture were added THF solutions
of either MeOPhCN (18.6 mg, 0.14 mmol) or CF3PhCN (23.9
mg, 0.14 mmol) and 1,4-butanediol (12.9 mg, 0.14 mmol). In a THF total
volume of 1 mL, each reaction mixture was transferred to a Schlenk
tube and heated at 120 °C in an oil bath under continuous stirring.
After 72 h for MeOPhCN and 168 h for CF3PhCN, each crude
reaction mixture was exposed to air, and 1 μL of aliquot was
analyzed using GC–MS.

Preparation of 1,4-Butanediol-d2
Under an uncontrolled atmosphere, 1,4-butanediol
(200 mg,
2.2 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of deuterium oxide (D2O
≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich). 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O, δ/ppm) 1,4-butanediol-d2: 3.47
(bs, 2H), 1.46 (bs, 2H). An additional signal was observed in δ
4.79, corresponding to H2O (bs, 1H)19 formed by isotope exchange. The solvent was evaporated,
and 1,4-butanediol-d2 was dried under
vacuum for 4 h, after which it was stored in the glovebox. A new NMR
spectrum was acquired. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm) 1,4-butanediol-d2: 5.09
(bs, 1H), 3.56 (bs, 20H), 1.58 (bs, 20H). From these data, 95% deuterium
incorporation was estimated.

Isotopic Labeling with 1,4-Butanediol-d2 Using 1 as a Precatalyst in the
TH of BN
In the glovebox, a mixture of dcype/dcypeO/dcypeO2 in
the molar ratio of 3:2:1 (6 mg) was dissolved in THF and added dropwise
to [Ni(COD)2] (2 mg) under stirring. To this mixture were
added THF solutions of BN (14.8 mg, 0.14 mmol) and 1,4-butanediol-d2 (12.9 mg, 0.14 mmol). In a THF total volume
of 1 mL, the reaction mixture was transferred to a Schlenk tube and
heated at 120 °C in an oil bath under continuous stirring. After
96 h, the crude reaction mixture was exposed to air, and 1 μL
of aliquot was analyzed using GC–MS. Deuterium incorporation
was confirmed by comparing the normalized abundance of the [M+]-isotopic peaks of the BBA obtained in this experiment with
the average normalized abundance of the [M+]-isotopic peaks
of five different MS of nondeuterated BBA obtained from five different
experiments.20 On the basis of this analysis,
a mixture of isotopologues, namely, BBA + BBA-d1 is proposed.
