Vinblastine and its
derivatives used in clinics as antitumor drugs
often cause drug resistance and some serious side effects; thus, it
is necessary to study new vinblastine analogues with strong anticancer
cytotoxicity and low toxicity. We designed a dimer molecule using
two vindoline-bonded dimer vindoline (DVB) and studied its interaction
with α,β-tubulin through the double-sided adhesive mechanism
to explore its anticancer cytotoxicity. In our work, DVB was docked
into the interface between α-tubulin and β-tubulin to
construct a complex protein structure, and then it was simulated for
100 ns using the molecular dynamics technology to become a stable
and refined complex protein structure. Based on such a refined structure,
the quantum chemistry at the level of the MP2/6-31G(d,p) method was
used to calculate the binding energies for DVB interacting with respective
residues. By the obtained binding energies, the active site residues
for interaction with DVB were found. Up to 20 active sites of residues
within α,β-tubulin interacting with DVB are labeled in
β-Asp179, β-Glu207, β-Tyr210, β-Asp211, β-Phe214,
β-Pro222, β-Tyr224, and β-Leu227 and α-Asn249,
α-Arg308, α-Lys326, α-Asn329, α-Ala333, α-Thr334,
α-Lys336, α-Lys338, α-Arg339, α-Ser340, α-Thr349,
and α-Phe351. The total binding energy between DVB and α,β-tubulin
is about −251.0 kJ·mol–1. The sampling
average force potential (PMF) method was further used to study the
dissociation free energy (ΔG) along the separation
trajectory of α,β-tubulin under the presence of DVB based
on the refined structure of DVB with α,β-tubulin. Because
of the presence of DVB within the interface between α- and β-tubulin,
ΔG is 252.3 kJ·mol–1. In contrast to the absence of DVB, the separation of pure β-tubulin
needs a free energy of 196.9 kJ·mol–1. The
data show that the presence of DVB adds more 55.4 kJ·mol–1 of ΔG to hinder the normal
separation of α,β-tubulin. Compared to vinblastine existing,
the free energy required for the separation of α,β-tubulin
is 220.5 kJ·mol–1. Vinblastine and DVB can
both be considered through the same double-sided adhesive mechanism
to give anticancer cytotoxicity. Because of the presence of DVB, a
larger free energy is needed for the separation of α,β-tubulin,
which suggests that DVB should have stronger anticancer cytotoxicity
than vinblastine and shows that DVB has a broad application prospect.

1 Introduction
Cancer has been one of
the most serious diseases endangering human
life and health.1 How to prevent and treat
various malignant tumors effectively is a great challenge for science
and medicine. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are the main
means to treat cancers. Chemotherapy can be used to treat systemically
and throughout the disease,2,3 at the same time, facing
drug resistance problems and serious side effects. Therefore, it is
necessary to study new drugs with strong anticancer cytotoxicity and
low toxicity. An important target for anticancer drugs is the tubulin
system4 because the cells enter the dividing
phase, that is, the M phase, and their cytoplasmic microtubules depolymerize
into tubulin and assemble into spindle microtubules. In the late stage
of the split, the spindle microtubules pull the sister chromatids
from the equatorial plane to the poles of the spindle. After the end
of mitosis, the spindle microtubules depolymerize and assemble into
cytoplasmic microtubules. Thus, the dynamic cycling (polymerization
and depolymerization process) between the tubulin and microtubules
is necessary for normal mitosis (M phase) of the cells.5−8 If this cycle is disrupted, cells entering the mitotic phase will
stop dividing and then apoptosis will be induced. Malignant tumor
cells have rapid proliferative capacity, and their mitotic process
is frequent and the cell cycle is significantly shorter than normal
cells. Therefore, if the above dynamic cycle is disrupted, the mitotic
process of the tumor cells is affected, and the growth thereof is
inhibited or the apoptosis of the tumor cells is induced. Tubulin
and microtubules are important targets for anticancer drugs because
of their important role in mitosis.

Tubulin is mainly composed
of α- and β-tubulin. Both
α- and β-tubulin contain about 450 amino acid residues,
have 42% homology in sequence, and can form heterodimer.9 As a target at α- and β-tubulin,
several drugs capable of disrupting the homeostasis of tubulin have
been developed. According to different mechanisms, drugs targeting
microtubulins can be divided into two categories: ones that promote
microtubulin polymerization, belonging to taxol compounds,10,11 and others that inhibit microtubulin polymerization, belonging to
colchicine compounds and vinblastine compounds.12,13

Vinblastine was isolated from the periwinkle. Because its
antitumor
activity had been verified, a variety of alkaloids have been isolated
from the periwinkle, and artificial semisynthetic analogues have also
been developed. Among them, vinblastine (VLB),14 vincristine (VCR),15 vindesin
(VDS),16 and vinorelbine (NVB)17 have good antitumor activity and are formally
applied in clinical practice.

Vinblastine and its derivatives
as anticancer drugs have the same
binding sites to get activity against cancer cells by double-sides
sticking mechanism interacting with α,β-tubulin.18 The combination of vinblastine with tubulin
inhibits the dynamics of microtubule polymerization, resulting in
the inability to form a spindle and termination of cells in the metaphase.19 However, after long-term use of vinblastine
as an anticancer drug, patients are prone to drug resistance and side
effects such as leukopenia, bone marrow suppression, and neurotoxicity
to varying degrees. Therefore, new vinblastine derivatives with high
anticancer cytotoxicity need to be discovered and developed.

At present, most studies on vinblastine derivatives focus on the
modification of the vinca alkaloid ring.20,21 One of the results was that vinflunine was obtained by modifying
the vinca alkaloid ring.22 It is generally
believed that the affinity of vinblastine using the vindoline ring
is stronger than that using the vinca alkaloid ring.23 Therefore, the vindoline ring of vinblastine has a relatively
few structural modifications. We hypothesized that if the vinca alkaloid
ring is replaced by the vindoline ring, it should be a very ideal
structural modification, which can evenly act as a real double-sided
adhesive mechanism, capable of symmetry interactions with α-
and β-tubulin, giving rise to a high activity of anticancer
cytotoxicity. Therefore, we design a dimer molecule from double vindoline-bonded
DVB shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Molecular structure of DVB bonded by a C–C bond.

We first optimized the structure of DVB using quantum
chemistry
and then docked it into the α,β-tubulin interface to construct
a complex structure. Using molecular dynamics technology, the complex
structure was optimized to obtain a stable and refined structure.
Based on the fine structure, we not only studied the active site residues
forming an active pocket for interaction with DVB but also investigated
the free energy along the separation trajectory of α,β-tubulin
under the presence of DVB. We explored the mechanism for DVB interacting
with α,β-tubulin to get its antitumor cell activity for
the development and application of DVB.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Results of Docking DVB
to α,β-Tubulin
The DVB molecular structure is
formed through the C–C bond
at the same position’s carbons in the benzene ring of the vindoline
ring. The DVB structure was optimized at the level of MP2/6-31G(d,p)
to get its minimum structure without negative frequency shown in Figures 1 and 12. Figure 2,
formed by Chimera program,24,25 shows the complex structure
docked for DVB with α,β-tubulin. The docking energy between
DVB and α,β-tubulin is −124.7 kJ·mol–1, composed of −103.8 kJ·mol–1 from
van der Waals interaction and −20.8 kJ·mol–1 from electrostatic interaction. In this figure, the small blue molecule
is DVB near guanosine 5′-diphosphate (GDP) which is shown in
red.

2.2 Molecular
Dynamics Simulation for the DVB-α,β-Tubulin
System
As usual, to characterize the stability using root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd),26−28 the values of rmsd for the total system and each
components are shown in Figure 3. In the total system, the rmsd of α,β-tubulin
is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a quick increment
of rmsd values takes place between 0 and 14 ns to arrive at a value
of 0.33 nm. During the period of 14–100 ns, rmsd is fluctuating
between 0.286 and 0.364 nm with a range of 0.081 nm at the center
around 0.320 nm, which indicates the structure of α,β-tubulin
to be a stable equilibrium state after 14 ns. The rmsd value of DVB
quickly reached to about 0.320 nm and fluctuated at the center of
0.320 nm. Because the component of water is relatively stable, their
rmsd values remained stable with a smooth line after 2 ns. The DVB-α,β-tubulin-H2O total system affected by the component of water reached
a stable state after 3.8 ns, and its rmsd value was fluctuating slightly
around 6.617 nm. After 100 ns of MD simulation, all the results of
rmsd showed the total system and respective components to be stable.

analysis of the total system DVB-α,β-tubulin-H2O and every component for 100 ns of MD simulation.

2.3 Active Site Residues for
Binding with DVB
within α,β-Tubulin
We determine the active site
residues using the binding energy (Eb)
between DVB and residues29 from the system
obtained after performing MD simulation for 100 ns with an additional
energy minimization. The MP2 method with the 6-31G(d,p) basis was
used to calculate Eb. The overlapping
error of basis was corrected by the Boys and Bernardi method. Table 1 shows the values
of Eb for DVB interacting with the residues
within a sphere of 6 Å radius around DVB. In Table 1, Eb(BSSE) includes the correction of basis overlap error (BSSE),30,31 and Eb is the values without correcting
basis overlap error. Similar to the previous studies,32−34 the active site residues are defined according to the value of Eb(BSSE) less than −4.0 kJ·mol–1.

of
DVB responsible for a binding energy of 4.11 kJ·mol–1 because of the distance of 0.2154 nm. The positively charged α-Arg308
also has an electrostatic interaction of −10.02 kJ·mol–1 with the carbonyl oxygen of −COOCH3 because of the distances of 0.4504 and 0.2381 nm, respectively.
The near distance of 0.2512 nm between β-Phe214 and DVB generates
a binding energy of −7.56 kJ·mol–1.

of −13.03 kJ·mol–1 with the carbonyl
oxygen of −OCOCH3 from DVB because of the distance
of 0.3510 nm. α-Ser340 forms a hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl
oxygen of −OCOCH3 responsible for the energy of
−5.53 kJ·mol–1 because of the distance
of 0.1534 nm. Similarly, α-Thr349 has a hydrogen bonding with
the carbonyl oxygen of −OCOCH3 in DVB to have an
energy of −4.59 kJ·mol–1 because of
the distance of 0.2778 nm. The phenolic OH from β-Tyr210 and
β-Tyr224 forms two hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen of C5N (6-member ring) to have the binding energies of −18.12
and −8.44 kJ·mol–1 because of the distances
of 0.1695 and 0.2643 nm, respectively. α-Ala333 has a weak hydrogen

discussion and comparisons, we can see the main interactions come
from the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between DVB
and the active site residues.

2.4 Free
Energy of α,β-Tubulin Moving
along Its Separation Trajectory
2.4.1 Free
Energy of Pure α,β-Tubulin
Separation
The free energy of pure α,β-tubulin
separation was reported.18 However, for
the sake of better understanding in comparison to the presence of
DVB, we briefly introduce the free energy for pure α,β-tubulin
moving along its separation trajectory.

On the basis of the
optimized pure α,β-tubulin structure, α-tubulin
was set as the reference group, β-tubulin was set as the moving
group, and GDP was set as a free group. An external force of no more
than 2000 kJ·mol–1 was applied to the x+ axis, thus to push β-tubulin moving along the x+ direction. In the actual process, the program provided
an appropriate external force less than 2000 kJ·mol–1 to make β-tubulin move and generate its separation trajectory.
The configurations of four points along the trajectory are shown in Figure 6, where (o) is the
starting point of the system, passing through the trajectory systems
of points (a) and (b), and reaching the trajectory system of point
(c), which shows that β-tubulin leaves from α-tubulin,
while GDP is moving with β-tubulin. The separated trajectory
has a total of 400 trajectory conformations recorded in a coordinate
file.

Figure 6 Four points of pure α,β-tubulin moving along its separation
trajectory. Panel (o) is the starting point of the system, with panel
(a) corresponding to sampling 147, panel (b) corresponding to sampling
260, and panel (c) corresponding to sampling 400.

The separation trajectory contained 400 sampling configurations,
from which, 81 umbrella sampling configurations were selected and
are listed in Table 2. The sampling system was rebalanced under the condition of a fixed
distance between the moving and reference groups after performing
MD simulation for 800 ps, during which the values of rmsd were used
to characterize the equilibrium of the sampling system (data not given).
The values of rmsd for the respective sampling systems were fluctuating
within a small range of 0.03 nm to indicate the sampling systems to
be rebalanced after 400 000 steps (800 ps) of MD simulation.

a N: sampling number, D: the distance between
two groups.

Then, the weighted
histogram analysis method (WHAM) from the Gromacs
4.5 program was used to convert the biased sampling into the unbiased
statistical results and obtain the free energy shown in Figure 7. For the sake of simplicity,
only key four configurations for β-tubulin moving along its
separation trajectory are given in Figure 6. Considering the distance and sampling number
together listed in Table 2, the position of β-tubulin along the protein system
can be determined to get the free-energy variety of β-tubulin
along the separation trajectory. The β-tubulin trajectory starts
from the starting point (o) (3.97, 0.00) corresponding to sampling
1, then point (a) (5.01, 142.54) corresponding to sampling 147 and
(b) (6.43, 194.82), corresponding to sampling 260, and reaches point

of β-tubulin along its trajectory goes up 196.85 kJ·mol–1, as shown in Figure 7.

2.4.2 Free
Energy of α,β-Tubulin with
DVB along the Separation Trajectory
Using the optimized DVB-α,β-tubulin
structure, the separation trajectory of β-tubulin was recorded,
during which β-tubulin was set as the moving group and the reference
group was α-tubulin, while DVB and GDP were set free. Four key
configurations along the trajectory are shown in Figure 8. Point (o) is the starting
system, after passing through points (a,b) and arriving at point (c),
to show β-tubulin leaving away from α-tubulin. DVB was
following α-tubulin, while GDP was moving with β-tubulin.
Ninety-five sampling systems were selected from the file of trajectory
coordinates recorded for β-tubulin to separate and are listed
in Table 3. All the
selected sampling systems were re-balanced after 800 ps of MD simulation
under the same conditions and characterized with rmsd fluctuating
within a small range of 0.03 nm.

Similarly, WHAM was used to convert the biased sampling
into the
unbiased statistical results and obtain the free energy shown in Figure 9. In combination
with the separation trajectory of α,β-tubulin shown in Figure 8, point (o) is the
initial state corresponding to sampling 1 with a distance of 3.98
nm between α- and β-tubulin. After point (a) (4.89, 162.23)
corresponding to sampling 131 and point (b) (6.46, 249.00) corresponding
to sampling 257, the system reaches point (c) (7.95, 250.10) corresponding
to sampling 398. Along the trajectory of α,β-tubulin separation,
the free-energy variation (ΔG) reaches 252.27
kJ·mol–1 under the presence of DVB in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Free energy variety of
α,β-tubulin along its separation
trajectory under the presence of DVB.

In Figure 10, the
weighted histograms of umbrella sampling are presented. The left panel
is for the separation trajectory of pure α,β-tubulin,
and the right panel is for the separation trajectory of α,β-tubulin
under the presence of DVB. Both weighted histograms of umbrella sampling
show good overlap to indicate that the calculated free energy is of
high reliability for α,β-tubulin separated along the trajectories.

Figure 10 Weight
histograms of umbrella sampling for pure α,β-tubulin
along its separation trajectory (left panel) and for α,β-tubulin
along its separation trajectory under the presence of DVB (right panel).

The interaction between DVB and
α,β-tubulin, calculated
by the quantum chemistry at the level of MP2/6-31G(d,p), is −250.98
kJ·mol–1 including the basis overlap error.
If no basis overlap error is included, the interaction is up to −470.34
kJ·mol–1. Because the calculation is performed
by the quantum chemistry, this interaction naturally includes the
hydrogen bonding and molecular interactions. However, our work did
not apply the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) to calculate
the independent hydrogen bonding energies between DVB and respective
residues, although a lot of very interesting work in relation to QTAIM
were published.35−39 Furthermore, the interaction of −250.98 kJ·mol–1 is very consistent with the separated free energy of −252.27
kJ·mol–1 between α- and β-tubulin
at the presence of DVB molecule. This result shows that the calculated
interaction between DVB and α,β-tubulin is reliable.

The free energy above along the trajectories of α,β-tubulin
separation was given under the presence and absence of DVB. Because
DVB is a vindoline dimer, its active sites are believed to be the
same as those of vinblastine because the same active sites are located
within the interface of α- and β-tubulin. It is known
that the essence of vinblastine for the treatment of various cancers
comes from its interaction with the active site residues within the
interface of α- and β-tubulin. Other factors have a little
effect. For reducing deviation like analytical chemistry, a relatively
pure sample is needed for obtaining the reliable results. Otherwise,
the results may be affected by some uncontrolled factors. Therefore,
we chose an interface system that is only associated with β-
and α-tubulin, which is directly related to DVB. Other structures,
which are not clearly associated with this interface, are not included
in our research system. In order to study the effect of DVB on the
interface of β- and α-tubulin, we specifically gave the
separation from pure β- and α-tubulin in the absence of
DVB. This investigation is like a blank experiment. The effects of
all backgrounds are included in the blank experiment. Under the same
experimental conditions, when DVB is present at the interface of β-
and α-tubulin, after considering the blank experiment, the results
of DVB interacting with α- and β-tubulin are readily available.
Therefore, we can obtain the significant results about the separation
trajectory and free energy of α,β-tubulin under the presence
of DVB compared with its absence. Furthermore, many experiments have
proved vinblastine and its derivatives to have strong anticancer cytotoxicity,
and then, vinblastine and its derivatives are currently still used
as antitumor drugs in clinics. Based on such experimental and clinical
basis from the vinblastine practice, the same method is used to study
the double-sided adhesive mechanism within α,β-tubulin
for the vindoline dimer compared with vinblastine to get anticancer
cytotoxicity; we can believe that the obtained result about DVB to
get better anticancer cytotoxicity also possesses the experimental
basis.

3 Conclusions
We dock
DVB to the α,β-tubulin interface to form the
DVB-α,β-tubulin system and get a docking energy of −124.7
kJ·mol–1. After 100 ns of MD simulation, the
stable and refined structure of DVB-α,β-tubulin was obtained.
Based on such a structure, we obtain as many as 20 active site residues
within α,β-tubulin interacting with DVB, which are β-Asp179,
β-Glu207, β-Tyr210, β-Asp211, β-Phe214, β-Pro222,
β-Tyr224, and β-Leu227 and α-Asn249, α-Arg308,
α-Lys326, α-Asn329, α-Ala333, α-Thr334, α-Lys336,
α-Lys338, α-Arg339, α-Ser340, α-Thr349, and
α-Phe351. The binding energy of DVB with α,β-tubulin
is up to −251.0 kJ·mol–1. The free energy
required for the dissociation of pure α,β-tubulin is 196.85
kJ·mol–1. Under the presence of DVB, the dissociation
of α,β-tubulin requires 252.27 kJ·mol–1 (ΔG). The data show that DVB increases the
free energy required for the separation of α,β-tubulin
through the double-sided adhesive mechanism, which disrupts the normal
dynamics between polymerization and depolymerization of α,β-tubulin.
Compared with vinblastine, the free energy required for the separation
of α,β-tubulin is going up 220.5 kJ·mol–1.18 Vinblastine and DVB can be considered
to acquire anticancer cytotoxicity using the same double-sided adhesive
mechanism. In the presence of DVB, larger free energy for the separation
of α,β-tubulin is required, which suggests that DVB would
possess a stronger anticancer cytotoxicity than vinblastine, thus
theoretically to imply that DVB has a broad application and a clear
development prospect.

4 Materials and Methods
The basic material of this paper is α,β-tubulin from
the protein crystal structure (CN: 1Z2B).40 In order to eliminate the influence of the external structure for
reducing errors and highlight the essence of interaction between DVB
and α,β-tubulin, we just extract the B chain (β-tubulin)
and C chain (α-tubulin) from the crystal structure (1Z2B). In Figure 11, the extracted
structure of α,β-tubulin contains a GDP molecule upon
the surface of the β-tubulin structure. In the end of α,β-tubulin,
some residues are missed; thus, the β-tubulin structure (B chain)
contains 427 residues and 1 GDP molecule and the α-tubulin structure
(C chain) contains 436 residues. The molecular structure of DVB (Figure 12) labeled in atomic numbers is optimized using the MP2/6-31G(d,p)
method from the Gaussian 03 program.41 The
optimized structure of DVB is determined without imaginary vibration
frequency calculated at the same method.

4.1 DVB Docked with α,β-Tubulin
To prepare the docking experiment, Sybyl 7.2 program was used to
give the correct atomic type of DVB,42 add
H atoms and Gasteiger–Hückel charge for DVB, and save
it as a file of MOL2 format. Meanwhile, H atoms and the charge of
Amber77 FF99 type were added to α,β-tubulin using the
Sybyl 7.2 program. The newly added H atoms need to be optimized. The
powell gradient method was used as an optimization method, and the
convergence standard was set as 0.04 kJ·mol–1, and the maximum number of steps was set as 10 000 with Tripos
force field applied and current charge used.43 It is the first step using the Dock6 program to construct the Sphgen
and then to select vinblastine originally existing in the crystal
structure as a docking active target.23,44,45 A sphere space within 8 Å was constructed to
generate a docking box. The max orientations were set to 5000. The
finale results were given by the grid scores performed with the DOCK6
program.

4.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulation for the DVB-α,β-Tubulin
System
The stable DVB conformation obtained by the docking
program was combined with α,β-tubulin to form a complex
structure. A top file of the complex protein was generated by the
pdb2gmx program from the Gromacs 4.5 program.46 A box of 12.0, 9.0, and 8.0 nm along x, y, and z axes, respectively, was set around
the complex protein as a center. It is along the vertical direction
set as the Z axis direction. SPC H2O was
added into the box.47,48 To ensure that the system is
electrically neutral, sodium ions are used to neutralize the negative
charge in the system. Figure 13 shows the structure of DVB-α,β-tubulin-H2O system containing 863 residues, a DVB, a GDP, 24 463
H2O, and 61 Na+. The force field parameters
of DVB were set according to gmx field format on its optimized structure.49−51 Some basic data were generated by the PRODRG program.52 The atomic charges of DVB were obtained from
the calculation by MP2/6-31G(d,p).

Figure 13 Structural picture of the DVB-α,β-tubulin-H2O complex system.

To eliminate possible particle overlap, the energy minimization
simulation (em step) using the Steep algorithm was performed for the
total system at the periodic boundary condition. The convergence standard
was set as 500.0 kJ·mol–1·nm–1, and the step length was given at 2 fs. The atomic electrostatic
interactions were calculated by the particle-mesh-ewald (PME) method,53,54 while the Coulomb threshold (rcoulomb) was set as 1.0 nm and the
van der Waals threshold (rvdw) was set as 1.0 nm too. When the system
temperature was increased to 310 K,55,56 the system
temperature balance (nvt step) was performed for
100 ps with a step length of 2 fs at the conditions of V-rescale used for temperature coupling and the coupling time constant
set to 0.1 ps.57

Then, the pressure
balance simulation (npt step)
was carried out for 3 ns using the Parrinello–Rahman method
at the conditions of 10 ps coupling time constant and a step length
of 2 fs. The temperature coupling was Nose–Hoover to increase
the pressure to 1 atm. After balancing the system pressure, MD simulation
of 100 ns was performed for the total system. During this simulation,
the temperature coupling time constant was set as 0.5 ps and pressure
coupling time constant was set as 10 ps. The coupling temperature
was 310 K, and the coupling pressure was 1 atm. The Coulomb force
threshold was set to 1.2 nm, van der Waals threshold (rvdw) was set
as 1.2 nm too, and simulation step size was set as 2 fs using a periodic
boundary condition.

4.3 Active Site Residues for
Binding with DVB
within Tubulin
The interaction of amino acids used as active
sites with small drug molecules directly affects the function of protein.47 We used the stable DVB-α,β-tubulin-H2O system after the dynamics simulation and further energy
minimization to study the active site residues. During the energy
minimization, the Steep algorithm and PME method was used to calculate
the atomic electrostatic interaction. The energy convergence was set
as 80 kJ·mol–1·nm–1.
After the energy minimization for the system, water and sodium ions
were removed to remain α,β-tubulin and DVB and then added
with H-bonding hydrogen and Gasteiger Hückel charges for the
DVB molecule and Amber7 FF99 for α,β-tubulin. Tripos field
was selected to optimize all added hydrogen atoms, and Powell mode
was selected as the optimization method. The gradient parameter was
0.04 kJ·mol–1 with step numbers of 10 000.
The optimization structure was saved in a file of MOL2 format. The
residues within the sphere of 6 Å radius around DVB as a center
were extracted to form a pair of DVB and respective residue, while
the carbonyl end and amino end of the residues were fixed with hydrogen
atoms.58,59 The binding energies of individual residues
with DVB were calculated using MP2/6-31G(d,p),60,61 and the overlapping error of basis was corrected by the Boys and
Bernardi method.62

4.4 Free-Energy
Surface along the Trajectory of
α,β-Tubulin Separation
Because α,β-tubulin
moves to separate and generate a trajectory, a large box needs to
ensure that the entire system has enough room for the movement. Therefore,
the simulation system box was reset to 18, 10, and 9 nm along the x, y, and z axis directions.
The number of water molecules filled in the system was changed to
49 733. Similarly, the constructed system was simulated by
MD simulation, and the energy minimization step (em step) was used
to balance the system and to eliminate particle overlap for promoting
a reasonable structure. After the completion of the energy minimization,
the equilibrium of the system temperature (nvt step)
and pressure (npt step) under the condition of allowing
the water molecules to move freely was performed. After the system
pressure was equilibrated, an MD simulation of 400 ps was performed
as an addition. The parameter settings for all steps were the same
as those in the previous section.

Based on the simulated DVB-α,β-tubulin-H2O system, a trajectory was generated by the Gromacs 4.5 program.
During this process, a protein chain was moving; thus, the complex
system is grouped in an ndx file. Chain B (β-tubulin) was grouped
into chain_A, and chain C (α-tubulin) was assigned to chain_B.
DVB was set as chain_C, and SOL and Na+ were used as a
component. The structural file obtained after the optimization of
MD simulation was used as the input file of the initial structure
for the trajectory dynamics with the same topology.

To study
the separation trajectory of α,β-tubulin under
the presence of DVB within the interface of α,β-tubulin,
it is necessary to apply an external force to a protein chain to move
away from another chain. In this work, external force was applied
to the B chain (β-tubulin) as a moving group, while chain_A
(α-tubulin) was used as a reference system. An external force
of no more than 2000 kJ·mol–1 along the X-axis direction forced β-tubulin to move and generate
its trajectory. The maximum movement speed was 10 nm·ns–1, and the step length was 2 fs with the number of steps set as 400 000.
The structural conformation was output once per 1 ps. The Coulomb
force threshold was set as 1.2 nm, and the van der Waals threshold
was 1.2 nm. The PME calculation was used, and the energies were divided
into five groups of DVB, protein, GDP, SOL, and Na. Temperature coupling
was Nose–Hoover with a coupling time constant of 0.5 ps. The
pressure coupling adopted Parrinello–Rahman with the coupling
time constant of 2 ps. Then, the system temperature was set to 310
K, and the pressure was set to 1.0 atm.63 We used VMD64 and Chimera65 programs to do the visual analysis for the output
trajectory data.

The umbrella sampling method from the Gromacs
4.5 program66,67 was used to obtain the free-energy
potential of α,β-tubulin
separation under the presence of DVB. The theoretical basis is on
the formula: ΔG = −RT ln K, where ΔG is free-energy
variety, R is ideal gas constant, T is kelvin temperature, and K is the equilibrium
constant of the system obtained by MD simulation.68

Using the g_dist program from the Gromacs 4.5 program,
the tpr
file generated in the previous step was calculated to give the umbrella
sampling recorded in the xvg file to contain 400 conformation data.
Starting from the minimum centroid distance between the reference
and moving groups, according to the 0.04 nm rule, a series of sampling
conformations was selected to rebalance the conformation systems.
The external forces to generate the movement of β-tubulin caused
the original complex system deviating from the equilibrium. Therefore,
before calculating the free-energy potential surface, it is necessary
to perform MD simulation on the selected umbrella sampling at the
defined centroid distance between the moving and reference groups,
so that each umbrella sampling system reached the equilibrium state
again. The molecular dynamics rebalancing umbrella sampling system
requires some files, including the umbrella sampling file, same topology
file, same pointer file, and parameter file. In the parameter file,
the centroid distance was set to be constant, and the motion speed
is set to 0 nm·ns–1, indicating that β-tubulin
did not move along the trajectory, except for vibration and rotating
at a given centroid distance for two groups. The number of simulation
steps was set to 400 000 (800 ps) with a step length of 2 fs.
rmsd was used to measure the balance of the sampling system.

WHAM (g_wham) in the Gromacs 4.5 program was adopted66 to convert the biased sampling above into unbiased
results. The potential of mean force was calculated from a series
of umbrella sampling, and the calculated deviation was below at 10–6 kJ·mol–1. By using average
force potential (PMF), the free-energy variety (ΔG) can be obtained. The g_wham program also outputs histogram data.
The weighted histogram can determine the reliability of free-energy
results. If the histogram has a high degree of overlap, the generated
PMF potential energy surface will be smooth and the free energy is
reliable.69−71
