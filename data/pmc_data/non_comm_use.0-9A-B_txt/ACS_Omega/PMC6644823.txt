This
study focuses on development of a new adsorption technique
by CO2-activated chitosan. Carbon dioxide was utilized
to form the functional chemical groups of chitosan on the adsorptions
of anionic dyes, Brilliant Blue FCF and Congo Red, in the aqueous
solution. CO2-activated chitosan results in the dye adsorption
significantly faster than that of chitosan in pure water. The adsorption
capacities and removal efficiencies of the dye are increased by CO2-activated chitosan. Furthermore, the dye adsorptions on CO2-activated chitosan were investigated at various temperatures
and initial dye concentrations in the aqueous solution. Interestingly,
the high temperature adsorption provides the enhancement of adsorption
capacities and removal efficiencies of the dye by the carbamate cross-linking
of chitosan with CO2. CO2-activated chitosan
was further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra, amino
group ratio, zeta potential, and thermal gravimetric analysis. These
characterizations can be used for understanding the unique adsorption
of the dye on CO2-activated chitosan. Carbon dioxide-activated
chitosan in this work will provide an effective operation and a clean
process of dye adsorption in wastewater treatment.

1 Introduction
Increment
of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has
become a recent concern because of the major cause of global warming.1 As the main product of fuel combustion, a huge
amount of CO2 is being released through industrial activities.
Although soil, plants, oceans, and rivers in the natural carbon cycle
can all absorb CO2, there is an urgent need to develop
effective and sustainable techniques to reduce and reuse CO2 in other applications.1,2 Supercritical CO2, for example, can be applied in many potential applications
such as fabrication process of porous materials,2,3 drug
delivery systems,4−7 and nanosuspensions.8,9 Carbon dioxide can be used for
switching polarity, hydrophilicity, or ionic strength of a solvent.10−13 Activated polymer systems by CO2 have been reported by
some research groups.13−17 Nagai et al.14 investigated the reactions
between CO2 and amines to form reversible cross-linked
carbamate polymers. Han et al.15,16 have also presented
the modification of lower critical solution temperature of polymers
activated by CO2. Carbamate polymers by CO2 were
also applied for separation of the complexes.17 The separation system using CO2-activated polymer is
expected to develop the simple separation process and provide CO2 utilization techniques.

Wastewater treatment is one
of the most important separation techniques
for human life. Synthetic dyes are used for many industrial fields;
however they usually come with some drawbacks resulting in environmental
and human body damages. The dye removal from the wastewater stream
has been demanded strongly because the dyes are difficult to separate
and are often carcinogenic.18 Adsorption
by chitosan has become an attractive separation process because of
the material’s abundance in the nature.18−26 Additionally, chitosan in the acidic aqueous solution can be a cationic
polymer, which possesses excellent interaction with the anionic pollutant
in the wastewater and increases the removal efficiencies of the dye.25,26 However, there are still challenges of chitosan in the acidic solution
on the actual wastewater stream because of the dissolution into the
acidic solution23,27−29 and the toxicity
and equipment damage by conventional acids, such as HCl or H2SO4. Although the cross-linked chitosan has been applied
for the wastewater treatment,30,31 the adsorption capacities
of the dye would be lower than that without cross-linking.

This
work gives a potential separation process using CO2-activated
chitosan applied for the dye adsorption in the aqueous
solution. The adsorption technique proposed in this work is expected
to provide an effective dye removal and “greener” separation
process in wastewater treatment and develop a new CO2 utilization
method. The pollutant dye adsorptions on CO2-activated
chitosan were investigated on the adsorption capacity, dye removal
efficiency, and the time required to reach adsorption equilibrium.
The stabilities of CO2-activated chitosan are discussed
by dissolution into the aqueous solution at various temperatures.
The chemical changes on chitosan activated by CO2 were
characterized by infrared (IR) spectra, NH2 group ratio,
thermal stability, and the surface charge in zeta potential.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Stability of Chitosan in
CO2-Activated
System
The stability of CO2-activated chitosan
can be important on dye adsorption because of being dissolved into
the low pH aqueous solution. Figure 1 gives the results of the weight of CO2-activated
chitosan treated at 25–55 °C, Wc in grams to that of the dried chitosan W0 in grams. Chitosan activated by CO2 at 25 and 35 °C
was dissolved in the aqueous solution by pH reduction. Interestingly,
CO2-activated chitosan treated at 45 and 55 °C were
not dissolved into the solution and stable with the swollen state
in the aqueous solution. This high stability of CO2-activated
chitosan at 45 and 55 °C could be resulted from cross-linking
of chitosan as mentioned at Section 2.2.

Figure 1 Stability of the CO2-activated chitosan
hydrogel in
the aqueous solution at 25 °C (red —●—),
35 °C (red —■—), 45 °C (red —▲—),
and 55 °C (red —◆—) and chitosan in pure
water at 25 °C (black --◆--) and 45 °C (black --■--).

2.2 Adsorption
of Brilliant Blue FCF on CO2-Activated Chitosan
The adsorption on CO2-activated chitosan is evaluated
in a removal efficiency E and adsorption capacity
of dye Qe is defined as follows 1   2  where C0 and Ce in mg L–1 are initial and
equilibrium concentrations of the dye in the aqueous solution, respectively. V is the volume of the aqueous solution in liters and Wc is the weight of the dried chitosan hydrogel
in grams. As given in Figure 1, the weight of CO2-activated chitosan at 25 °C
is reduced by dissolution during adsorption. The value of Wc at the adsorption time over 30 min was corrected
by the following equation 3  

The derivation
of eq 3 can be found
in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 shows the
results of Brilliant Blue FCF (BBF) removal efficiencies and the adsorption
capacities of CO2-activated chitosan at 25 °C in the
case of the initial dye concentration of 5.0 mg L–1. The results in the case of CO2-activated chitosan are
compared with those in the HCl aqueous solution (pH 3.0) and without
CO2 (pH 7.0). In Figure 2a, the removal of BBF by CO2-activated chitosan
can reach the saturation state in only 40 min, whereas the removal
of BBF by chitosan in pure water requires too long a time over 480
min for the saturation state. The results of CO2-activated
chitosan are similar to that in the HCl aqueous solution. CO2-activated chitosan can provide strong interaction with the sulfonic
group SO3– of the BBF molecule in the
aqueous solution because of the protonation of the amino group NH3+ as given in Figure 3a. The results of BBF adsorption capacities
on CO2-activated chitosan at 25 °C are shown in Figure 2b. The adsorption
capacities of BBF by CO2-activated chitosan are higher
than those by chitosan in pure water because of the interaction between
BBF and protonated amino groups of chitosan. The rapid increase of
the adsorption capacity of CO2-activated chitosan could
be by the dissolution of chitosan into the aqueous solution. This
result suggest that the benefits of CO2-activated chitosan
could be fully maximized by the improvement of the chitosan stability
in the aqueous solution.

Figure 4 gives the
effect of temperature on BBF removal efficiencies by CO2-activated chitosan in the initial concentration 5.0 mg L–1. The higher removal efficiencies of BBF are provided at the higher
temperature adsorption on CO2-activated chitosan. The removal
efficiencies by CO2-activated chitosan at the highest temperature
of 55 °C reach over 90% in the adsorption for 180 min. Chitosan
in pure water results in the reduction of the BBF removal efficiencies
by increasing temperatures from 25 to 45 °C as presented in the Supporting Information. This means an exothermic
adsorption by chitosan in pure water as reported well in other studies.21,32 Reddy and Lee also reported that most of the magnetic chitosan composites
adsorbed a reactive dye in exothermic nature.33 The temperature effect on the BBF adsorption by CO2-activated
chitosan tends to be opposite to those of chitosan in pure water.
Also, the adsorption on CO2-activated chitosan at high
temperatures increases the stabilities of chitosan in the aqueous
solution as given in Figure 5. To investigate these unique results, the pH value in the
dye aqueous solution during adsorption on CO2-activated
chitosan was measured. The pH value in the solution during adsorption
would be increased by dye adsorption on chitosan as reported in other
studies.20,32,34 It was found
that the initial pH value did not vary significantly by increasing
the temperatures as given in the Supporting Information. This means the stability of chitosan at high temperatures are not
affected by CO2 solubility and the pH value in the aqueous
solution. This unique phenomenon of CO2-activated chitosan
could be from the internal modification of the chitosan network. As
shown in Figure 6,
CO2 could form a carbamate cross-linking in the chitosan
network, which is reported in the system of CO2 and amine.14,17,35,36 The high temperature could reduce the activation energy for the
carbamate formation by CO2 and amine,37 consequently the chitosan stability in CO2-activated
system is enhanced. The formation of the carbamate cross-linking of
chitosan is investigated further by the chitosan characterization
at Section 2.4. These
synergistic effects on the dye removal efficiency and chitosan stability
at higher temperatures suggest the possibilities of the dye adsorption
by CO2-activated chitosan in wastewater for a longer period.

Figure 4 Effects
of temperature on removal efficiency of BBF by CO2-activated
chitosan in C0 = 5.0 mg L–1 at 25 °C (black ■), 35 °C (red ◆),
45 °C (blue ▲), and 55 °C (green ●).

°C.

Figure 6 Mechanism of chitosan cross-linking by CO2 at high temperatures.

The BBF adsorption on CO2-activated chitosan is
also
investigated at various initial BBF concentrations 5.0–2000.0
mg L–1 in the aqueous solution at 25 °C as
given in Figure 7.
In Figure 7a, the adsorption
capacities of CO2-activated chitosan at high initial BBF
concentration are much higher than those of chitosan in pure water
because of the interaction between BBF and the protonated chitosan.
The adsorption capacity of CO2-activated chitosan was around
3121 mg g–1 at initial 600 mg L–1. The removal efficiencies of BBF increase and then decrease gradually
with increasing the initial concentration as given in Figure 7b. This could be because of
the saturation of the protonated amino groups in chitosan by the adsorption
of BBF. It can also be seen that at very low initial BBF concentration
(less than 10 mg L–1), the dye adsorption capacity
of chitosan in pure water is higher than CO2-activated
chitosan. This is because at low initial BBF concentration, the SO3– groups on dye molecules can be attracted
to both protonated NH3+ groups on chitosan molecules
or H+ ions in the aqueous solution. When initial BBF concentration
is higher than 10 mg L–1, the attraction with H+ ions becomes negligible, whereas the strong electrostatic
attraction between protonated NH3+ groups on
chitosan molecules and the SO3– groups
on BBF molecules becomes dominant. Therefore, at initial BBF concentration
higher than 10 mg L–1, the adsorption capacity of
CO2-activated chitosan was found to be significantly higher
than chitosan in pure water. The time of reaching the adsorption equilibrium
was also found to be affected by the initial BBF concentration. An
increase of the initial concentration results in increasing in the
time of reaching adsorption equilibrium (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 7 Effects of initial BBF concentration on
(a) adsorption capacity
and (b) removal efficiency at 25 °C: CO2-activated
chitosan (blue ●) and chitosan in pure water (red ▲).

2.3 Adsorption
of Congo Red on CO2-Activated
Chitosan
Figure 8 shows the effect of the temperature on the removal efficiencies
of Congo Red (CR) by CO2-activated chitosan. The initial
CR concentration in the aqueous solution was 10.0 mg L–1. At temperatures 25–55 °C, the CR removal efficiencies
increase rapidly and then decrease gradually because of the chitosan
dissolution into the aqueous solution. The removal efficiencies of
BBF at 25 °C as given in Figure 2a are not reduced although chitosan was dissolved.
This might be because the interaction of CR with the protonated chitosan
is weaker than that of BBF. The protonated chitosan could be exposed
to water molecules faster than bonding with CR, consequently leading
to the dissolution faster than that in the case of BBF. The removal
efficiencies of CR on CO2-activated chitosan are lower
than those of BBF. The molecular structure of CR includes an amino
group which is protonated by CO2. The protonated amino
group of CR could be repulsive with chitosan protonated by CO2 as given in Figure 3b. The adsorption amount of CR on CO2-activated
chitosan is lower than that of BBF. At 65 °C, the removal efficiency
of CR is over 40%.

Figure 8 Effects of temperature on CR removal efficiency by CO2-activated chitosan in C0 = 10.0
mg L–1 at 25 °C (black ■), 35 °C
(red ◆),
55 °C (green ●), and 65 °C (yellow ▲).

2.4 Characterization
of CO2-Activated
Chitosan
2.4.1 IR Spectra
Figure 9 shows the IR spectra of chitosan after BBF
adsorption for 3 h in the initial concentration 5.0 mg L–1 in the CO2-activated system (a), pure water at 25 (b)
and 55 °C (c), and the IR spectra of pure chitosan (d). Typical
peaks include the overlapping of OH stretching and NH stretching vibrations
at around 3348 cm–1, NH bending vibration at 1657
cm–1, which have also been reported in other literature
studies.27,38 The CO2-activated chitosan for
adsorption at 55 °C shows a new peak at the wavenumber 1730 cm–1, although no peak is detected for chitosan treated
at 25 and 55 °C. This new peak is for C=O stretching
vibration, which could be the result of the carbamate cross-linking
in the chitosan network as mentioned at Section 2.2.

and (d) original chitosan.

2.4.2 Ratio of NH2 Group in Chitosan
The amino group NH2 in chitosan plays an important role
to both removal efficiency and stability of the chitosan hydrogel
because NH2 groups in chitosan work as the dye adsorption
site and the cross-linking part by carbamate formation. Table 1 lists the results of the NH2 ratio in CO2-activated chitosan treated for 1.5
h at 65 °C. CO2-activated chitosan results in a NH2 ratio lower that of the pure chitosan hydrogel, which is
very similar to the NH2 ratio in chitosan cross-linked
by tri-polyphosphate (TPP) 0.0082 M in the solution. Moreover, the
BBF adsorption capacity of CO2-activated chitosan and chitosan
cross-linked by TPP 0.0082 M was found to be almost the same (see Supporting Information). This result indicates
that CO2-activated chitosan at high temperatures can form
the cross-linking similar to that by TPP.

chitosan-TPP (0.0136 M)	0.011	
chitosan-TPP (0.0082 M)	0.070	
2.4.3 Zeta Potential
The results of the
zeta potentials for CO2-activated chitosan at 45, 55, and
65 °C are given in Table 2. CO2-activated chitosan has the positive surface
charge by the protonation of amino groups. McCann et al.39,40 have reported that chitosan and CO2 can form three functional
groups, the protonated amino group (NH3+), carbamate,
and bicarbonate. The reaction of chitosan with CO2 was
also investigated on the effect of amine types on the formation of
functional groups, NH3+, carbamate, and bicarbonate.41−45 It is reported that the primary and secondary amines lead to the
production of the stable carbamate. Chitosan could produce mainly
carbamate because of having the primary amino group in its molecular
structure. The carbamate formation with CO2 is exothermic
and not favorable at high temperatures. It is thought that the protonated
amino group NH3+ could be more dominant than
carbamate as the available adsorption site for the dye at high temperatures.
This is also explained from the results of the zeta potential in Table 2 as the zeta potential
increases with temperature. The results of zeta potential are used
for understanding the high removal efficiencies of BBF on CO2-activated chitosan at high temperatures as given in Figure 5.

Chitosan in Aqueous Solution

2.4.4 Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
The
results of thermal gravimetric analysis of CO2-activated
chitosan treated for 1.5 h at 65 °C are given in Figure 10 and compared with those of
pure chitosan and chitosan cross-linked by TPP 0.136 M. Chitosan activated
by CO2 gives the decomposition temperature lower than that
of pure chitosan. According to Neto et al.,46 the reduction of the decomposition temperature can be found in cross-linking
of the chitosan network due to the disruption of hydrogen bonding
inside the chitosan network. For the chitosan hydrogel cross-linked
by TPP, the concentration of the TPP solution was high (0.136 M),
which means a lot of amino groups of chitosan are cross-linked. The
decomposition temperature of chitosan cross-linked by TPP is much
lower than that of pure chitosan as given in Figure 10. At higher temperatures over than 350 °C,
CO2-activated chitosan results in weight reduction same
as that of pure chitosan because the carbamate cross-linking can be
easily decomposed by heating.14,47

3 Conclusions
Dye adsorption on carbon dioxide-activated chitosan in the aqueous
solution was investigated. CO2-activated chitosan possesses
dye adsorption more rapidly than that in pure water. The dye adsorption
capacities and stability of CO2-activated chitosan are
increased at high temperatures, in which the carbamate cross-linking
of chitosan is formed with CO2. The dye initial concentration
in the aqueous solution affects the adsorption capacities on CO2-activated chitosan, dye removal efficiencies, and the time
of reaching the adsorption equilibrium. The dye removal efficiencies
by CO2-activated chitosan decrease at the high initial
concentration in the aqueous solution. It is found that the BBF dye
results in the adsorption capacities of CO2-activated chitosan
higher than those in the case of CR with the repulsive amino group
to chitosan. The characterizations of CO2-activated chitosan
suggest the formation of carbamate cross-linking in the chitosan network.

The dye adsorption using CO2-activated chitosan is expected
to achieve a simple, low cost, and short operation in wastewater treatment.
Furthermore, the CO2 utilization proposed in this work
will provide an environmentally benign and no corrosive nature on
dye adsorption in wastewater.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Chitosan, acetic acid,
sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium TPP, disodium
2-[[4-[ethyl-[(3-sulfonatophenyl)methyl]amino]phenyl]-[4-[ethyl-[(3-sulfonatophenyl)methyl]azaniumylidene]cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]methyl]benzenesulfonate
(BBF), and disodium; 4-amino-3-[[4-[4-[(1-amino-4-sulfonatonaphthalen-2-yl)diazenyl]phenyl]phenyl]diazenyl]naphthalene-1-sulfonate
(CR) were all purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind. Ltd., Japan.
The purities of acetic acid, NaOH, HCl, TPP, and BBF were higher than
99.9, 97.0, 35.0–37.0, 85.0, and 85.0 by mass, respectively.
Chitosan had a degree of deacetylation of more than 80%. Ultrapure
water was produced by the Direct-Q UV3 water purification system (EMD
Millipore Co.), and the resistivity was 18.2 MΩ cm.

4.2 Fabrication of Chitosan Hydrogel
Two different types
of chitosan hydrogel were fabricated; those with
and without cross-linking by TPP. Chitosan was firstly dissolved into
a 2.0 wt % acetic acid aqueous solution with the chitosan composition
2.5 wt % in the solution. The viscous chitosan aqueous solution was
vigorously stirred for 5 h, sealed, and left overnight to remove any
bubbles remaining in the solution. After stirring, the chitosan solution
was dropped from a syringe (TERUMO SS-10SZ) into the coagulation mixture,
TPP aqueous solution, and 10.0 wt % NaOH aqueous solution in the case
of those with and without cross-linking. Various concentrations of
TPP solutions, 0.0082, 0.0136, and 0.136 M, were used. After coagulation,
the chitosan hydrogel formed was left overnight before being washed
extensively by ultrapure water. All fabricated chitosan hydrogel samples
were spherical in shape with an average diameter of 4.1 mm and were
stored in ultrapure water.

4.3 Dye Adsorption on CO2-Activated
Chitosan
Chitosan hydrogels fabricated at Section 2.2 without TPP cross-linking
were activated by CO2 bubbling in the aqueous solution
and used for dye adsorptions. A known amount of the dye powder, BBF,
or CR was firstly dissolved into ultrapure water for preparation of
the aqueous solution. The setup of the adsorption system with CO2-activated chitosan is illustrated in Figure 11. Carbon dioxide from a gas cylinder was
installed into the adsorption vessel. The flow rate of CO2 was controlled by a gas flow controller (Kofloc RK-1200) as 200
mL min–1. The temperature of the adsorption system
was kept in a water thermostatic bath (Yamato Thermomate BF 200).
Chitosan 1.0 g was loaded into the dye aqueous solution of 200 mL.
The initial pH of the dye aqueous solution before the adsorption was
3.9 because of the dissolution of CO2. The pH of the solution
was measured by Waterproof pHTestr 20 (Oaklon).

Figure 11 Schematic diagram of
the CO2-activated system for dye
adsorption on the chitosan hydrogel: (1) CO2 gas cylinder,
(2) pressure regulator, (3) gas flow rate controller, (4) CO2 inlet pipe, (5) CO2 outlet pipe, (6) adsorption vessel,
(7) water thermostatic bath, and (8) temperature controller unit.

The dye concentration in the aqueous
solution during the adsorption
experiment was measured by a UV–vis spectrometer (JASCO V730).
The absorbances at the wavelength 629 and 498 nm were used for the
determination of BBF and CR, respectively. In the case of CR, as the
dye color changes in the low pH solution which leads to a λmax shift, the peak area of absorbance at the wavenumbers 418–578
nm was used for the determination of the concentration.

4.4 Characterization of Chitosan
The
molecular vibrations of chitosan treated in the adsorption were investigated
by a Fourier transform IR spectrometer. The IR spectra of chitosan
were measured at the wavenumbers 600–4000 cm–1 using JASCO FT-IR 4100 after drying at 60 °C for 12 h.

The ratio of the NH2 group in chitosan was used for knowing
the cross-linking in the CO2-activated adsorption system.
The titration method was applied for the determination of the NH2 ratio in chitosan. Chitosan (0.5 g) was dispersed in 100
mL of ultrapure water, and then an aqueous HCl solution with pH 1.9
was slowly dropped at the rate of 0.1 mL min–1.
Because of the increased amount of H+ in the solution,
pH would decrease and then increase again by the protonation of NH2 groups in chitosan. Therefore, the ratio of the NH2 group in chitosan in the unit of mmol g–1 can
be given from the pH change of the solution.

The surface charge
of the chitosan hydrogel in the CO2-activated adsorption
system was studied by the measurement of zeta
potential. The chitosan treated in the CO2-activated adsorption
system at 45, 55, and 65 °C for 2 h were dried at 60 °C
for 12 h. The dried chitosan was ground into its fine powder and dispersed
into ultrapure water in 1.0 mg mL–1. The suspension
of chitosan was sonicated for 30 min, vigorously stirred at 500 rpm
for 2 h, and allowed to settle for 1 h. The supernatant phase of the
suspension was taken for zeta potential measurements by nano partica
SZ-100-Z, HORIBA Ltd.

The thermal gravimetric analysis of chitosan
was also conducted
to investigate the effect of CO2-activated adsorption system
on thermal stability. The chitosan activated by CO2 at
65 °C for 1.5 h and that cross-linked by TPP 0.136 M was dried
at 60 °C for 12 h and analyzed by using Shimadzu TGA-50.

The weight of CO2-activated chitosan treated in the
aqueous solution was measured to know the stability by the dissolution
at low pH.
