Here, we have discussed the preparation of a highly solution processable
graphene from a novel supramolecular assembly consisting of block
copolymer polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) and pyrenebutyric acid (PBA)-modified reduced graphene
oxide (RGO). The PBA molecules anchored on the graphene surface form
supramolecules with PS-b-P4VP through H-bonding between
the carboxylic acid group of 1-pyrenebutyric acid and the pyridine
ring of P4VP. The formation of a supramolecular assembly results in
a highly stable solution of reduced graphene oxide in common organic
solvents, such as 1,4-dioxane and chloroform. Highly transparent and
mechanically stable thin films can be deposited from these supramolecular
assemblies on a relatively smooth surface of different substrates
such as silicon wafer, glass, indium tin oxide, and flexible polymer
substrates like poly(ethylene terephthalate). The graphene surface
modifier (PBA) can be selectively removed from the thin film of the
hybrid material by simple dissolution, resulting in a porous structure.
Hybrid thin films of around 50 nm thickness exhibit interesting electrochemical
properties with an areal capacitance value of 17.73 μF/cm2 at a current density of 2.66 μA/cm2 and
good electrochemical stability. The pendent P4VP chains present in
the composite thin film were further exploited for electrochemical
detection of metal ions. The electrical measurement of the thin film
sandwich structure of the composite shows a bipolar resistive switching
memory with hysteresis-like current–voltage characteristics
and electrical bistability. The OFF state shows ohmic conduction at
a lower voltage and trap-free space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
conduction at high voltage, whereas the ON state conduction is controlled
by ohmic at low bias voltage, trap-free SCLC at moderate voltage, and
tarp-assisted SCLC at high voltage.

Introduction
Carbon-based materials
have attained considerable research attention
as electrode materials for different applications such as energy storage
devices (supercapacitors, batteries), electrochemical sensors, corrosion
inhibition materials, actuators, flexible electronic devices, etc.,
because of their unique properties such as high surface area, excellent
electrical conductivity, compatibility with other materials, and good
mechanical stability.1−8 Graphene, owing to its large in-plane conductivities, is one of
the most promising materials for the development of electrodes for
a wide range of potential applications.9 Graphene and its derivatives have been blended with different materials
such as metals, metal oxides, and polymers with an aim of fabricating
graphene-based composite materials with superior properties.7,8,10−13 However, achieving graphene–polymer
nanocomposites with good dispersion is an ongoing challenge because
of strong agglomeration and settling of graphene especially at a higher
loading.11−13 One smart approach is to assemble graphene into the
polymer matrix in a controllable manner by supramolecular chemistry
through specific noncovalent interactions like hydrogen bonding. Block
copolymers (BCPs) self-assemble into well-ordered periodic structures
(spherical, cylindrical, gyroidal, lamellar) depending on the ratio
of block lengths and segment–segment interaction parameters.14−16 Block copolymers have been widely used as a host matrix/template
to manipulate the guest additive in hybrid systems with physical and
chemical stability.17 There are few reports
of block copolymer graphene nanocomposite materials where graphene
oxide (GO) dispersion in a polymer matrix is improved by hydrogen
bonding interactions between the oxygen-containing functionality on
the graphene oxide sheet and one of the blocks of the block copolymer.18 The weak interaction force with block copolymers
which mainly relies on the extent of oxygen-containing functionalities
(−OH, COOH group) on the graphene oxide surface, strong stacking
force, and its hydrophilic nature make it still difficult for graphene oxide to produce homogeneous fully
organic solvent processable composites for fabrication of a highly
transparent and conducting coating. However, the noncovalent modification19 of graphene oxide is an elegant way to introduce
desired functionalities without creating defect sites and can be exploited
for the preparation of block copolymer supramolecular assembly (SMA).

In this article, we have reported a novel approach for preparing
block copolymer-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supramolecular assembly
consisting of block copolymer polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine)
(PS-b-P4VP) and pyrenebutyric acid (PBA)-modified
reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The supramolecular assembly is formed
through hydrogen bonding between the anchored PBA molecules of the
graphene surface and the pyridine ring of P4VP. The formation of supramolecular
assembly results in a highly stable solution of reduced graphene oxide
in common organic solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and chloroform. The
graphene surface modifier (PBA) can be selectively removed from the
thin film of the hybrid material by simple dissolution, resulting
in a porous structure.

Graphene-based ultrathin films have attracted
significant research
attention because of their superior electrochemical properties especially their use in
the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes.20 So far, different strategies such as layer-by-layer assembly, coating
from a dispersion of reduced graphene oxide-conducting polymer hybrid,
and spray coating are commonly used to fabricate such thin films.21−26 In our case, we have fabricated graphene-based porous thin films
simply by spin-coating of the reduced graphene oxide-block copolymer
composite solution. The study of the electrochemical properties of
these hybrid thin films shows an areal capacitance value of 17.73
μF/cm2 at a current density of 2.66 μA/cm2 with good electrochemical stability.

We are also aware
of the extensive previous investigation of the
transition metal complexes of P4VP by Agnew.27 There are several reports where the metal ion–P4VP interaction
is extensively used for the preparation of metal nanostructures or
patterns and gels.28−30 Ho et al.31 made a detailed
investigation on the association strength of different metal ions
with P4VP by studying the variation in the effective excluded volume
in inorganic/poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)
hybrids. The combined properties of the electrical double layer formed from graphene
and the binding affinity of the free 4VP moiety in the P4VP chain
with metal ion can be exploited for electrochemical applications like
detection of metal ions. Interestingly, such a composite electrode
shows selective, quantitative, and more sensitive detection toward
toxic Hg2+ ions.

However, development of new graphene–polymer
semiconducting
composite materials is one of the highest priority areas because of
their wide range of potential applications in organic field-effect
transistors, photovoltaics, sensing devices, memory devices, etc.32−34,18 For fabricating such composite
materials, different organic semiconducting polymers have been mainly
employed where the nature of interaction of the polymers with graphene
has been exploited to produce working electronic devices. Introduction
of a percolating graphene network within an insulating polymer matrix
to develop semiconducting materials was originally reported by Eda
and Chhowalla,35 who managed to fabricate
working transistors via blending reduced graphene oxide with an insulating
polymer. Here, we have shown that the composite film in a sandwich
structure shows nonlinear I–V characteristics typically of the semiconductor and exhibits bipolar
memristive switching with hysteresis-like current–voltage characteristics
and electrical bistability. We have also studied the conduction and
switching mechanisms of the composite film.

Results and Discussion
The schematic structure of the supramolecular assembly formation
between block copolymer (BCP) PS-b-P4VP and PBA-RGO
and the photograph of its solution in 1,4-dioxane are depicted in Figure 1. The formation of
a highly homogeneous stable colloidal solution stable up to 1 month
clearly indicates sufficient interaction between PBA-modified reduced
graphene oxide and the block copolymer. The percentage of reduction
in the oxygen functionality in RGO of PBA-RGO from GO was calculated
from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure S1, Supporting Information), and it is around 71%. Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected (Figure 2a,b) to elucidate the successful
supramolecular assembly formation through hydrogen bonding between
P4VP and PBA-RGO. As seen from Figure 2a, the decrease in the peak intensity of the free pyridine
ring at 1002 cm–1 and the appearance of a new broad
peak at 1014 cm–1 due to the hydrogen-bonded pyridine
ring from BCP to BCP-PBA-RGO clearly evidence the interaction of PS-b-P4VP and PBA-RGO through hydrogen bonding between the
pyridine ring of P4VP and the carboxylic group of PBA anchored on
the GO surface.36,37 The formation of hydrogen bonds
is further confirmed by the bifurcation of the band at 1694 cm–1 (corresponding to the stretching frequency of the
C=O bond from the carboxylic acid group of PBA) to 1696 and
1656 cm–1 in BCP-PBA-RGO (Figure 2b). This bifurcation of the C=O stretching
frequency in BCP-PBA-RGO may be due to the different types of arrangements
of the pyrenebutyric acid group inside the block copolymer microdomain
in BCP-PBA-RGO, which create different types of chemical environments
around the C=O bond compared to those in PBA-RGO.16,36,37 The increase of the C=O
bond length of PBA in PBA-RGO after hydrogen bonding with the block
copolymer also contributes to the lowering of the C=O stretching
frequency. A similar type of bifurcation or trifurcation of the C=O
bond stretching frequency of PBA in block copolymer supramolecular
assembly was also observed in our previous study.16Figure 3 shows the optical image of the BCP-PBA-RGO composite thin film on
different substrates. From the images, it is clear that the composite
thin films of thickness around 180 nm are highly transparent. The
transparency values of the films on the glass substrate were measured
by a UV–vis spectrometer to be 95 and 92% for 50 and 180 nm
thick films, respectively. The transparency values of the poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates after coating
with the PBA-RGO-BCP thin film are around 76 and 83%, respectively,
almost equal to the transparency of the original substrate.

Figure 3 Plot of the film thickness of the device vs the transmittance at
550 nm (the inset shows the image of the composite transparent film
on the glass substrate and flexible transparent substrate by depositing
BCP-PBA-RGO on an ITO-coated PET film).

Thin films from BCP-PBA-RGO on a glass or an ITO substrate
were
further washed in ethanol to remove PBA and make porous thin films
of BCP-RGO. The formation of a porous structure through removal of
PBA molecules through simple dissolution is already reported in our
previous work.10,37 The complete removal of PBA is
evidenced by UV–vis studies (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The porous structure developed from both
block copolymer microphase separation and removal of the PBA molecule
(through creation of void space) will increase the percolation of
the electrolyte and should enhance the electrochemical performance
of the composite film. The surface morphology of the composite thin
film on the ITO surface was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
(Figure 4). The pristine
block copolymer thin film deposited from 1,4-dioxane shows a hexagonally
packed ordered cylindrical morphology consisting of a P4VP cylinder
and PS matrix36,37 (Figure 4a). The BCP-PBA-RGO composite films deposited
on the ITO substrate exhibit (Figure 4b) good dispersion of graphene oxide layers of varying
aggregated sizes in the block copolymer matrix. The line scan of the
height profile (Figure S3, Supporting Information)
data clearly indicates that graphene oxide layers are present ranging
from nearly single layer to aggregates having multiple numbers of
layers. These aggregates may be attributed to supramolecular assembly
formation between PBA-modified RGO and block copolymer through hydrogen
bonding. The block copolymers may act as a binder to bind multiple
graphene sheets, which form aggregates of different heights, as observed
from AFM images. The higher-magnification image (Figure 4c) clearly indicates the microphase
separation of the block copolymer in the composite material. The microphase
separation is not as regular as in the pristine block copolymer because
of ill-defined microphase separation of the block copolymer guided
by large graphene sheets. The morphology of BCP-PBA-RGO was further
characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 5), which clearly
shows the good dispersion of the graphene layers in the block copolymer
matrix without very large agglomerates and the block copolymer shows
microphase separation, which is not ordered as a pure block copolymer.
For the electrochemical study, the thin films deposited from BCP-PBA-RGO
on the ITO substrate were washed in ethanol to remove PBA molecules
and denoted BCP-RGO. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of blank ITO, BCP,
and BCP-RGO thin film (∼50 nm thickness) on the ITO surface
taken in 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution at a scan rate
0.1 V/s are shown in Figure 6a. The voltammetry curves of BCP-RGO show a considerably rectangular
shape, characteristic of capacitive behavior of carbon materials.
The area under the CV curve of BCP-RGO is increased drastically compared
to that of blank ITO or pristine BCP thin film, clearly indicating
its better capacitance performance at this scan rate. The better capacitance
performance of BCP-RGO can be attributed to the extra double layer
capacitance contribution from the graphene material dispersed in the
block copolymer matrix. The porous structure of the BCP-RGO layer
with an interconnected network of graphene will further improve the
capacitance value. The CV curves of the BCP-RGO thin film deposited
on the ITO substrate at different scan rates are displayed in Figure 6b. The subsequent
increase of the redox current with the increasing scan rate clearly
indicates its good rate ability. The galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) experiments of the BCP-RGO thin film on the ITO substrate were
carried out at different current densities (Figure 6c). All of the curves exhibit an equatorial
triangle shape, indicating high reversibility of the ultrathin hybrid
electrode during the charge–discharge process. The charging/discharging
process took a longer time at a lower current density, attributed
to the sufficient insertion or release of ions during the charging/discharging
process. If we compare the charge–discharge plot of BCP-RGO
with blank ITO (Figure S5, Supporting Information)
or pristine BCP thin film, it can be easily concluded that the BCP-RGO
composite electrode shows a dramatic improvement in the electrochemical
capacitance performance compared to that of blank ITO or BCP. The
BCP-modified electrode does not show any stable charge–discharge
curve, whereas blank ITO shows very small discharge time of 3.0 s
at a current density of 1 μA/cm2. The areal capacitance
(C) of the electrode at different current densities
was calculated according to the following equation: C = (iΔt)/(AΔV), where “i”
is the charge–discharge current, Δt is
the discharge time, ΔV is the potential window,
and A is the active area of the electrode. The areal
capacitance values for the BCP-RGO-modified electrode are 17.73, 16.25,
and 16.66 μF/cm2 for current densities of 2.66, 1.33,
and 1 μA/cm2, respectively, which agree well with
the reported value for the graphene-based thin film of a similar thickness
in earlier literature.38−40 This better electrochemical capacitance performance
of BCP-RGO can be attributed to the double layer contribution from
the interconnecting graphene layer network in the composite materials
as well as its porous structure, which maximizes the percolation of
electrolyte throughout the materials. Figure 6d demonstrates the charge–discharge
cycles for the BCP-RGO-modified electrode for consecutive first 100
cycles at 2.66 A/cm2. The reproducible charge–discharge
curve for a larger number of cycles clearly implies its utilization
in real applications. As the graphene block copolymer composite films
contain free 4-vinyl moieties that can interact with different metal
ions, they may be
used for electrochemical detection of metal ions. The introduction
of reduced graphene oxide has improved the redox current as discussed
earlier and will increase the detection limit. For electrochemical
detection, glassy carbon electrodes are often used.41,42 However, the applications of glassy carbon electrodes are limited
due to their high price and the small size of the electrode tip. In
contrast, in our case, the electrode material with large surface area,
in square centimeters, can be easily fabricated by spin-coating. Previously,
graphene–polymer hybrid materials have been successfully exploited
for the detection of heavy metal ions such as Hg2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+.43−47 Li et al.46,47 developed a Nafion–graphene
composite film for the detection of metal ions Pb2+ and
Cd2+, where the synergistic effect of graphene and Nafion
improved the sensitivity compared to that form the individual component.
He et al.43 demonstrated a novel DNA-grafted
graphene biosensor based on the hybridization of a probe DNA with
a target DNA having four thymine–thymine (T–T) mismatches
through T–Hg2+–T coordination chemistry.
However, the P4VP homopolymer or its block copolymer-based hybrid
materials have been explored very little for electrochemical sensing
of metal ions. Figure 7a shows the CV curves of different electrodes (bare ITO and BCP-RGO-deposited
ITO) in the presence of the Hg2+ ion (1 mmol solution of
HgCl2 in water). CV from bare ITO produces an oxidative
peak at 0.32 V and a reductive peak at 0.08 V, corresponding to the
oxidation/reduction process of the Hg/Hg2+ species.4 In the case of the BCP-RGO electrode, the oxidation
and reduction peaks dramatically decreased compared to those in bare
ITO, clearly indicating its sensitivity toward the detection of metal
ions. Now, the selective detection of a particular metal ion is another
essential criterion for a detection technique to be useful for practical
application. We have chosen the potential window 0.7 to −0.3
V and tried with other commonly used transition metal ions, such as
Cr3+ (CrCl3·6H2O, E0 = −0.74 V), Cd2+ (CdCl2, E0 = −0.4 V), Fe3+ (Fe(NO3)·9H2O, E0 = −0.04 V), Fe2+ (FeCl2·4H2O, E0 = −0.44 V), Cu2+ (CuSO4·5H2O, E0 = +0.34 V), Zn2+ (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, E0 = −0.7618 V), Pb2+ (Pb(CH3COO)2, E0 = −0.13 V), and Ag+ (AgNO3, E0 = 0.80 V), where E0 is the standard electrode potential with respect to the hydrogen
electrode. As expected from their standard electrode potentials, Hg/Hg2+ and Ag/Ag+ should show complete oxidative/reductive
peaks in the scanned potential window (from −0.3 to +0.7 V).
The electrochemical study of both bare ITO and the composite-modified
ITO electrode was also performed in the presence of the Ag+ ion (AgNO3 solution, 1 mmol in water; Figure S6, Supporting Information). A similar reduction in
the peak current in the case of the composite-modified electrode was
observed, but Hg2+ produced more reduction in the peak
current compared with the blank ITO electrode (99%) and Ag+ (85%). Furthermore, as the oxidation and reduction potentials of
both the ions are different, one can easily differentiate between
the two ions. As the current electrochemical detection technique employs
both the standard electrode potential of a metal ion and its interaction
with the electrode surface, the employed electrode will have marked advantage
for selective detection. The more quenching of the reductive peak
current for Hg2+ may be attributed to the strong interaction
of the Hg2+ ion with P4VP chains compared to that of Ag+ ions31 (UV–vis spectra; Figure S7, Supporting Information). The relatively
strong coordination of Hg2+ to the P4VP chains anchored
to the graphene surface was also evidenced from the FTIR study (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The characteristic
absorption peak at 1602 cm–1 corresponding to the
CN stretching vibration of pyridine of P4VP chains31 shifted to 1614 cm–1 upon coordination
with Hg2+, whereas the peak at 1602 cm–1 remained unchanged after coordination with the Ag+ ion.
In the case of both ions, the dramatic decrease in the peak current
may be explained by strong binding of the metal ions with the P4VP
polymer chains located at the outer surface of the electrode, resulting
in a substantial reduction in charge transfer at the electrode–solution
interface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a very
useful technique to investigate the ability of the material to transfer
and exchange charges with the surrounding molecules/electrode surface.48Figure 7b shows the EIS spectra of blank ITO and BCP-RGO-modified
graphene in the presence of the Hg2+ ion. The drastic increase
in charge transfer resistance (Rct) from
the ITO to the BCP-RGO electrode may be due to the strong coordination
of Hg2+ to P4VP chains, resulting in resistance to charge
transfer to the electrode surface and increase in charge transfer
resistance. We further investigate the quantitative detection performance
of the BCP-RGO-modified electrode, which is essential for its practical
applications. It is observed that the peak current increases with
an increase in the concentration of both Hg2+ and Ag+ (Figure S7, Supporting Information).
The variation of the reductive peak current versus concentration of
Hg2+ is shown in Figure 7c. The linear nature of the plot clearly indicates
its real applicability for quantitative detection of metal ions in
an unknown solution. The relative decrease (%) of the reductive current
with respect to the blank electrode at a potential of 0.092 V is shown
in Figure 7d. Interestingly,
Hg2+ and Ag+ (for other transition metal ions,
the current also decreases depending on the ion) show a drastic reduction
in the relative current, whereas alkali or alkaline earth metal ions
show a significant increase in the relative current in the potential
range studied. The increase in the CV current in the case of alkali
or alkaline earth metal ions, such as K+, Ba2+, and Mg2+, may be attributed to their weak association
with P4VP chains compared to that of transition metal ions, resulting
in relatively low charge transfer resistance and their extra contribution
toward double layer formation from the graphene layers present in
the composite materials. The preliminary results clearly indicate
that the proposed composite material may be useful for electrochemical
detection of metal ions. The sensitivity and specificity can be further
improved by functionalizing the P4VP chains, i.e., with metal/metal
oxide nanoparticles. Figure 8a depicts the I–V characteristics of ITO/BCP-PBA-RGO/Al devices at room temperature
(for I–V characteristics
of a flexible device from ITO-coated PET, see Figure S9). The work function of ITO ranges from 4.2 to 4.7
eV, and for RGO, it varies between 4.7 and 4.9 eV depending upon the
material processing,49 whereas Al is known
to have a work function of 4.3 eV.50 The
device made from an insulating block copolymer shows a very low current
because of its insulating nature. As expected, devices of composites
containing a small amount of PBA-RGO (2 and 5%) do not show any electric
transition in the voltage sweep because of the high percolation threshold.
However, devices made from a block copolymer composite thin film with
a higher content of PBA-RGO, 10% (BCP-PBA-RGO-A, thickness ∼60
nm) and 15% (BCP-PBA-RGO-B, thickness ∼50 nm and BCP-PBA-RGO-C,
thickness ∼180 nm), result in a high current, indicating a
low electrical percolation threshold value. The thin film devices
of BCP-PBA-RGO-B and BCP-PBA-RGO-C are highly symmetrical in nature,
indicating the absence of the Schottky barrier. However, the device
made from the block copolymer composite having 10% PBA-RGO (BCP-PBA-RGO-A)
shows a rectifying characteristic (inset of Figure 8a). Resistive memory exhibits two distinct
resistive states, which can be written at a specific voltage and nondestructively
read with another voltage, resulting in hysteresis in its current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics. The
device can be reversibly switched between a high-resistance state
(HRS, OFF) and low-resistance state (LRS, ON) in direct current (dc)
sweep or pulse mode.51,52

Figure 8b
demonstrates
the memristive switching of composite thin film device BCP-PBA-RGO-C
by showing typical pinch hysteresis-like current–voltage characteristics
and electrical bistability on a linear scale obtained by sweeping
the dc bias in four steps (−6 → 0 → +6 →
0 → −6). Indeed, bipolar memristive switching characteristics
are observed. Multiple switching I–V curves (where each curve almost follows the same path
of its predecessor) from the same device (Figure S10, Supporting Information) clearly demonstrate its high degree
of repeatability.

The current after the application of a V-sweep
of positive and negative polarity demonstrated that a positive V-sweep (−6 to 0 V) induces a low-resistance state
(LRS, OFF) in the negative voltage region by the repeated read-out
at −4 V (Figure 8b and Supporting Information) and a subsequent
application of a large negative V-sweep (0 to −6)
induces a high-resistance state (HRS, ON) in the negative voltage
region by the repeated read-out at −4 V. Note that the resistance
switching states can also be established in the positive voltage region.
Therefore, application of a large positive V-sweep
(0 to +6 V) induces the HRS and a large negative V-sweep induces the LRS. The characteristics are reproducible in all
memory cells of the composite device. Both HRS and LRS are stable
at a read-out voltage of −4 V (Figure 9a). Space-charge-limited conduction (SCLC)
takes place in low-mobility semiconductors, when the injected charge
density exceeds the intrinsic free carrier density of the materials.
It is the dominant transport mechanism if at least one contact is
able to inject relatively higher carrier densities than those the material
has in thermal equilibrium. In the devices under investigation, ITO
is expected to form an ohmic contact with PBA-RGO by making the conduction
space-charge-limited. Therefore, the measured I–V data were analyzed in light of SCLC to get insight into
the conduction mechanism of BCP-PBA-RGO. At moderate voltage, the
current–voltage relationship becomes nonlinear as the SCLC
dominates. When the trap states are absent or do not affect the charge
transport, the current density is defined by the Mott–Gurney
law: J = (9/8)εε0μV2/L3, where J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant
of the polymer, ε0 is the permittivity of the free
space, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the thickness of the layer. To find the SCLC region,
we fitted measured data with the relation J ∝ V, where the symbols are experimental data points and solid
lines represent fit to them. Under the low voltage of the OFF state
(−5 to 0 V), the curve shows a linear relationship with m ≈ 1, signifying ohmic conduction that might be
controlled by the thermally generated free carriers. At a higher voltage,
the slope of the I–V curve
in the log–log scale increases to 2 (m ≈
2) at the high voltage bias that reveals predominated trap-free SCLC
conduction. However, the ON state (0 to −5) shows ohmic conduction
in the lower-voltage region and trap-free SCLC conduction in the intermediate-voltage
region. Above a voltage of 1.5 V, m > 2, indicating
that the conduction is governed by traps that are exponentially distributed
in energy.53,54 Such conduction is known as exponentially
distributed trap-limited SCLC. The bistable hysteresis properties
correspond to the amount of traps present in the composite thin film
layer, and charge hopping can occur with a coexisting charge trapping
environment. It is reported that graphene oxide can serve as a charge
trapping center from the structural defect.55,56 At a lower voltage, charge transport is limited because of the insulating
barrier provided by BCP and PBA molecules anchored on the graphene
surface, and RGO may capture the injected charge from the electrode.
At the switching voltage, interplane hopping occurs between the RGO
sheets, traps are filled, and the overall electrical conductivity
increases through the trap-free environment. In this case, the ON/OFF
ratio is lower compared
to that in other polymer graphene-based devices reported in the literature18 because of the less amount of structural defects
in PBA-RGO compared to those in GO, resulting in less trapping of

Conclusions
A novel strategy for
preparing highly solution processable graphene
through a supramolecular assembly consisting of block copolymer polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) and
pyrenebutyric acid (PBA)-modified reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is
reported here. The PBA molecules anchored on the graphene surface
form supramolecules with PS-b-P4VP through H-bonding
between the carboxylic acid group of 1-pyrenebutyric acid and the
pyridine ring of P4VP. The formation of a supramolecular assembly
results in a highly stable solution of reduced graphene in common
organic solvents. Transparent and mechanically stable thin films on
versatile substrates, such as silicon, glass, ITO, and flexible polymer
substrates like PET, can be fabricated from this supramolecular assembly
solution. The reduced graphene oxide surface modifier can be selectively
removed from the thin film to create a porous electrode material with
free pyridine moieties. The electrochemical properties of this ultrathin
electrode show an areal capacitance value of 17.73 μF/cm2 at a current density of 2.66 μA/cm2 with
good electrochemical stability. The pendent free P4VP chains that
can coordinate with metal ions were further exploited for their possible
use in the electrochemical detection of metal ions. Interestingly,
such a composite electrode exhibits selective, quantitative, and more
sensitive detection of toxic Hg2+ ions. The electrical
measurement of the thin film sandwich structure of the composite clearly
indicates a bipolar resistive switching memory with hysteresis-like
current–voltage characteristics and electrical bistability.
The conduction mechanism of the sandwich device was investigated.
The OFF state shows ohmic conduction at a lower voltage and trap-free
SCLC conduction at high voltage. The ON state conduction is controlled
by ohmic at low bias voltage, trap-free SCLC at moderate voltage,
and trap-assisted SCLC at high voltage. We believe that these types
of functional thin films will find application for thin film capacitors,
metal ion sensors, and electronic and memory devices.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Graphite powder, pyrenebutyric acid (PBA),
1,4-dioxane, and hydrazine monohydrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Other chemicals such as HgCl2, AgNO3, H2O2, KMnO4, NaNO3, sulfuric
acid (98%), and NaOH were purchased from commercial sources in analytical
grade. ITO (resistance 70–100 Ω/sq.) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and cleaned before use in thin film fabrication and
electrochemical measurements. PS (32 900)-b-P4VP (8000) (PDI = 1.06) was purchased from Polymer Source Inc.

Synthesis of the Materials
Graphene oxide was synthesized
following the modified Hummers and Offeman method.57,58 The preparation of PBA-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PBA-RGO)
was carried out according to the procedure reported in the earlier
literature with some modification.10

The block copolymer (BCP) supramolecular assembly with different
compositions of PBA-functionalized graphene oxide (BCP-PBA-RGO) was
prepared by dissolving PS-b-P4VP and PBA-RGO in 1,4-dioxane
by sonication for 1 h. PBA-RGO was taken as 15% by weight for all
measurements unless otherwise mentioned because this composition shows
the best results. The resulting solution in 1,4-dioxane (the total
concentration of PS-b-P4VP and PBA-RGO, 1–2%
(w/v)) was further heated at 60 °C for 3 h and kept overnight
at room temperature to complete the hydrogen-bond formation. The solution
is further centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to remove any undissolved
large coagulation. The resulting dark colloidal solution of the reduced
graphene oxide and block copolymer after centrifugation is quite stable
even for 1 month and more. Thin films of the composite solution on
the ITO/glass substrate were deposited by spin-coating from the filtered
solutions. Using varying spin rates and concentrations, films of different
thicknesses were deposited and the thicknesses were measured by AFM.
Before electrochemical measurements, the composite films were annealed
in the 1,4-dioxane vapor for 20 min to obtain the equilibrium structure.
The solvent-annealed thin films were immersed into ethanol for 10
min (a good solvent for P4VP and a nonsolvent for PS). The dipping
or washing process in ethanol will selectively remove PBA, and surface
reconstruction will occur with a porous and fine structure.16,36

Characterization
FTIR measurements in the region of
4000–500 cm–1 were performed at room temperature
using a KBr pellet of the samples in a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer
(Spectrum Two). UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on
Shimadzu UV-3600 plus (UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer).
AFM imaging was performed on spin-coated thin films (NT-MDT, Russia; Solver
Pro-4, atomic force microscope) in the tapping mode. All electrochemical
experiments, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) methods, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were
performed using a CHI6087E electrochemical workstation (CHI) by a
conventional three-electrode system. In the present study, Ag/AgCl
as the reference electrode, a Pt wire electrode as the counter electrode,
blank ITO or block copolymer graphene thin film deposited on an ITO-coated
glass substrate as a working electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the supporting electrolyte were used. For the electrochemical
sensing study, different metal salts of prerequisite concentrations
were dissolved in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution and
studied. I–V measurements
were carried out from the sandwich structures on the ITO-coated glass
substrate. Thin films were spin-casted from the solution of BCP-PBA-RGO
on a thoroughly cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate. The samples were
dried at 60 °C for an additional 3 h in a vacuum oven for the
complete removal of the solvent. A layer of Al was deposited on the
thin film to act as the top electrode. I–V characteristics of the samples were measured using a Keithley
SourceMeter, model 2450 SMU, under vacuum.
