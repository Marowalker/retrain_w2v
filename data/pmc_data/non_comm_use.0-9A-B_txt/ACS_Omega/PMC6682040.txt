Cetrimonium bromide (CTAB)-coated
water disperse magnetically separable
nanocatalysts CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@ML (M = Fe or
Mn, L = cyclohexane-1,2-diylbis(azanylylidene)bis(methanylylidene)bis(2,4-diXphenol;
X = Cl, Br, and I) have been synthesized using a simple synthetic
strategy. This approach provides a new fruitful strategy to reduce
the leaching of the active metal complex from the catalyst surface
to the aqueous media. The synthesized catalysts have been found to
be excellent for oxidation of alcohols in aqueous medium at room temperature.
A probable catalytic pathway involving the generation of hydroperoxo
intermediates has been assumed, and these intermediates have been
characterized using density functional theory and several spectroscopic
techniques. It is worthy of mention that the synthesized CTAB-coated
magnetically separable nanocatalysts can be magnetically recovered
from the aqueous reaction mixture after more than five cycles, which
renders this approach as a sustainable and accessible one.

1 Introduction
Cleaner and greener protocols coupled with safe and mild conditions
for oxidation of alcohols are high in demand in modern organic chemistry
because the oxidation products are the foundation of various natural,
unnatural, and biologically active molecules.1−7 To date, many reports for the oxidation of alcohols using environmentally
toxic metal oxidants or the combination of the oxidant and heavy metal-based
catalysts are available. However, most of the catalytic reactions
mainly suffer from low cost effectiveness and lack of green and sustainable
reaction conditions.8−12 Therefore, cheap and eco-friendly reaction procedures for the selective
oxidation of alcohols are demanded.

In this context, heterogeneous
metal-supported catalysts in an
aqueous medium may be one of the desirable solutions, considering
the ease of recovery and recyclability. Magnetic nanomaterials have
drawn extensive attention in the field of nanomaterials and catalysis
owing to their superparamagnetic property. Among the known magnetic
materials, catalysis iron oxide-based nanoparticles have harnessed
much attention with many attractive features like high surface area,
high loading, superior efficiency, high thermal stability, effortless
recovery, and a cost-effective nature.13−15

However, water
solubility of the organic starting materials is
the main problem that can be resolved by a new strategy based on the
use of surfactants that facilitate the formation of micelles. They
will effectively improve the possibility of contact between the organic
starting materials and the catalysts in water.16−18

The use
of surfactants will solve another critical problem regarding
the supported metal nanomaterials, that is, the leaching of the metal
complex/metal ions from the nanoparticle surface to the bulk phase,
which would render the entire process of heterogenization ineffective.
In this sense, Lee and coworkers have recently reported a water soluble
catalyst system involving Rh nanoparticles holding a cetrimonium bromide
(CTAB)/ionic liquid micelle structure which emerged as an efficient
catalyst in oxidation of alcohols in water.16

In this work, we describe the fabrication and full characterization
of water soluble iron(III) and manganese(III) Schiff base and complexes
immobilized on dopamine-stabilized Fe3O4 magnetic
nanoparticles bearing a CTAB micelle structure (CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@FeL and CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@MnL)
(see Scheme 1). These
water soluble nanocatalytic systems affords efficient oxidation of
alcohols with the aid of a green oxidant, H2O2, thereby rendering the present approach a much economical, safer,
and environmentally benign option. Apart from improving the reaction
conditions, we have assumed that hydroperoxo intermediates have a
relevant role in the reaction mechanism and we have characterized
them by theoretical calculations based on density functional theory
(DFT). The UV–visible and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) studies also support the formation of the hydroperoxo species.
To the best of our knowledge, such reports of admicelle formation
based on a composite nanoparticle system like the Fe3O4@dopa@complex have not yet been reported.

2 Results
and Discussion
As a part of our ongoing effort to elucidate
the role of the ligand
backbone on the oxidation capability of iron and manganese complexes,
we synthesized a series of iron(III) complexes namely 1, 2, and 3, and a series of Mn(III) complexes
namely 4, 5, and 6 from a series
of tetradentate ligands (H2L1, H2L2, H2L3) (see Schemes S1 and S2
at the Supporting Information). Initially,
treatment of H2L1, H2L2, and H2L3 with FeCl3·6H2O forms wine red solutions of FeL1, FeL2, and FeL3, respectively. Evaporation of the solvent from
solutions of FeL1 and FeL2 generated a solid
product that rendered dark red crystals of 1 and 2 upon recrystallisation from dimethylformamide solution,
while treatment of MnCl2·6H2O with H2L1, H2L2, and H2L3 forms deep brown solutions of 4, 5, and 6. Evaporation of the solvent from solutions
of 4 and 5 afforded a deep brown product
that yielded deep brown crystals of 4 and 5. Complexes 1, 2 and 4, 5 were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analyses (Figure 1).
(See Supporting Information for detailed
crystal structure elaboration and ORTEP view of complexes 2 and 5, Figure S1 at the Supporting Information). The crystallographic data and details of refinement
are given in Table S1 at the Supporting Information, bond length and bond angles for complexes 1, 2, 4, and 5 are given at Tables
S2–S5, respectively, at the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 ORTEP drawing (50% probability ellipsoid) of complex 1 (left) and complex 4 (right).

The oxidation of alcohols catalyzed by homogeneous
catalysts was
initially considered. The catalytic activity of FeL1, FeL2, FeL3, MnL1, MnL2, and MnL3, (1–6) was studied for alcohol oxidations
by H2O2 (Table S6 at the Supporting Information). At the onset of the study, benzyl
alcohol was selected as the model substrate to determine the optimum
reaction conditions such as solvent, amount of oxidant, amount of
catalyst, and time. All the reactions were performed at room temperature.
Because H2O2 decomposes rapidly in the presence
of iron and manganese catalysts,19 we checked
that the best way of adding it was drop wise. In the absence of the
catalysts, the control reaction gave very poor yield of aldehyde,
that is, <5% in 4 h, indicating the crucial role played by catalysts.
Oxidation of alcohols using acetonitrile as the solvent gave the best
results. To select the optimum catalyst concentration 0.05, 0.5, 1,
1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 mmol of each of the six homogeneous catalysts were
used. The reaction completed within 5 h with a concentration of 0.05
mmol of the catalyst with 80% conversion and a yield of 55%. The rate
of the reaction boosted within 3 h when the concentration of the catalyst
was elevated to 1 mmol. The bigger catalyst concentration up to 2
nm rendered >95% yield and 100% conversion within 4 h. Hence, a
catalyst
loading of 2 mmol was adjudged to be the optimal one. The role of
the concentration of H2O2 was also investigated.
Although slightly lower yields were obtained with a concentration
of 0.50 mmol of H2O2, it rapidly increased when
the concentration of H2O2 was increased to 3
mmol. Further reactions were performed with these optimal conditions.
All six homogeneous catalysts demonstrated excellent activity for
the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Table S2, entries 1–6). Interestingly, MnL1 and FeL1, with chloro substituents in the catalyst ligand,
performed better amongst the six homogeneous catalysts. Therefore,
these two homogeneous catalysts were considered for heterogenization
with Fe3O4@dopa followed by coating with the
surfactant.

The zeta potential experiment was performed to investigate
the
adsorption of surfactants on the nanoparticle surface (Figure 2). At pH7, zeta potential values
of Fe3O4@dopa@FeL (HCAT-1) and
Fe3O4@dopa@MnL (HCAT-2) were found
to be −31.3 and −29.8 mV, respectively. Considering
the surface charge of these nanoparticles, a positively charged surfactant
CTAB has been used for their surface modification. With the increasing
concentration of CTAB the zeta potential value continuously increases,
then, reversal of surface charge takes place, and, finally, it becomes
almost constant [31 and 33.4 mV for CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-2, respectively
(Figure 2)]. The mechanism
of adsorption of CTAB on the nanoparticle surface can be explained
considering electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions. Initially,
the zeta potential value shifted from negative to zero because of
formation of hemimicelles, that is, surfactant monolayers, at the
cost of electrostatic interaction between the head part of CTAB and
the negatively charged surface. Then, mixed hemimicelle formation
takes place in the concentration range 20–100 mg/L due to both
the electrostatic and lateral hydrophobic interaction between the
tail part of the CTAB molecules. Finally, at high concentration of
the CTAB surfactant, bilayers formed by hydrophobic interactions.
Therefore, the surface charge of the admicelles becomes positive.

of concentration of CTAB.

Figure 3 represents
the Z-average micelle diameters as a function of
CTAB concentrations. At pH 7 the average hydrodynamic radius of the
iron and manganese nanoparticles are 347 and 327 nm, respectively.
With the increasing concentration of CTAB the hydrodynamic radii gradually
increases up to a certain concentration; then, further increment of
CTAB concentration makes it decrease. This phenomenon can be explained
in terms of three consecutive processes. At a low concentration range,
with the increase of CTAB concentration formation of hemimicelles
takes place along with a slight increment of hydrodynamic radii; then,
agglomerations takes place among neighboring nanoparticles because
of hydrophobic interactions between the tail part of the CTAB molecules.
At a high concentration of CTAB, further agglomerations revert to
small nanoparticles.

CHCAT-2
as a function of concentration of CTAB.

Figure S2 shows the typical Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectrum of HCAT-1 and
CHCAT-1. Prepared nano HCAT-1 shows absorption peaks
at around 580 and 631 cm–1, which are the characteristic
absorptions of the Fe–O bond, confirming the presence of iron
oxide, as previously reported.20−23 Dopamine incorporation is confirmed by the presence
of a peak around 1480 cm–1, which can be attributed
to the vibration of the benzene ring present at the dopamine moiety.
In the case of CTAB-coated magnetically separable nanoparticle CHCAT-1,
a bunch of peaks at 2846, 2914, and 2953 cm–1 can
be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of −CH2-moieties of the long alkyl chain of CTAB and the antisymmetric
stretching mode of the trimethylammonium head group for CTAB are identified
by a peak around 3015 cm–1, which further proves
the presence of CTAB at the surface of our synthesized magnetically
separable nanoparticles CHCAT-1.

The dried powder samples HCAT-1, HCAT-2, CHCAT-1, and CHCAT-2 obtained
after washing with the solvent mixtures
were characterized by powder XRD (PXRD) for phase purity. The XRD
patterns of all four samples confirm the formation of the magnetite
phase (Fe3O4), without any other impurities
(Figure S3). From the PXRD spectrum of
CHCAT-1 in Figure S3, a peak at 2θ
= 21° indicates the coating of CTAB onto the surface of HCAT-1.24 Intensities of HCAT-1 are found to be lower than the CHCAT-1 ones, which
can be attributed to the alteration in orientation from HCAT-1 to CHCAT-1.

The morphologies of HCAT-1 and its
corresponding CTAB-coated
analogue CHCAT-1 were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
technique, which are shown in Figure 4. From Figure 4 (left) it is evident that in the absence of CTAB, roughly
spherical particles of HCAT-1 are formed of size ranging
from 200–250 nm. In the case of CHCAT-1, roughly oval shaped
particles are observed (Figure 4 (right)). In the case of CHCAT-1, the surface is rough as
compared to that of HCAT-1, which indicates CTAB-induced
surface modification.25,26 Similarly, from the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of HCAT-2 (Figure 5 (left)) it can be
seen that fiber-shaped nanoparticles of fibre width around 200 nm
were formed. After coating with CTAB, the nanosheet array of CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@MnL is formed.27 It is important to note that the CTAB-coated magnetically separable
nanoparticles CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-2 are well dispersed in aqueous solution,
whereas the analogous uncoated nanoparticles are not stable in aqueous
solution. Thus, CTAB plays an important role in the formation of stable
assembled structures of magnetically separable nanoparticles making
the system sufficiently hydrophilic.

Figure 5 (Left) SEM image of HCAT-2 (right) and SEM image of
CHCAT-2.

The magnetic measurements of HCAT-1 and CHCAT-1 have
been carried out at room temperature, and the results are displayed
in (Figure S4a–d at the Supporting Information). It is evident from the recorded M–H loop that both are ferromagnetic at this temperature.
The magnetization of the prepared iron oxide was 61.376 emu g–1 and it decreased to a value of 44.574 emu g–1 after coating with dopamine. The magnetization value of Fe3O4@dopa decreased further to a value of 37.5303 emu g–1 after the anchoring of complex 1. Finally,
surfactant CTAB-coated CHCAT-1 generated a magnetization value of
25.425 emu g–1. The low magnetization value exhibited
by CHCAT-1 compared to the HCAT-1 one, Fe3O4@dopa, Fe3O4 could be due to the
contribution of the nonmagnetic surfactant moiety on the surface of HCAT-1. Despite the low magnetization value of the catalyst
CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@FeL, it is still sufficient
for its efficient recovery from the reaction mixture with the help
of an external magnet.

As already said, the two most efficient
homogeneous catalysts,
FeL1 and MnL1, were chosen for surface modification
of our magnetic nanoparticles forming the newly synthesized CTAB-coated
heterogeneous catalysts CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-2. Unlike in the homogeneous
case, with these catalysts, all the oxidations were performed in aqueous
media. Taking 1 mmol of benzyl alcohol as the test substrate, the
catalyst concentration was varied between 80 and 120 mg. An increment
of the catalyst concentration from 100 to 110 mg, resulted in an increase
of the yield but further increase did not improve this yield. The
time was varied between 3 and 7 h. The optimum yield of products was
obtained in 5 h and it did not enlarge even after 8 h. As a consequence,
a typical heterogeneous catalytic reaction consisted of alcohols (1
mmol), H2O2 (4 mmol), and CHCAT (120 mg), with
a continuous stirring for 6 h. We have checked that CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-2
show significant catalytic activity for oxidation of a wide variety
of alcohols to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone (Table 1).

b Isolated yield.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that a composite
system of CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@ML (M = Mn or Fe)
was found to have an appreciable catalytic performance in oxidation
of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones only in aqueous medium. Transfer
of poorly aqueous soluble nanoparticles Fe3O4@dopa@ML(M = Mn or Fe) to water media could be achieved thanks to
the formation of an additional layer of the surfactant onto the nanoparticle
surface in the so-called admicelles, the zeta potential studies confirmed
this point. The admicelle motifs are a very crucial part of the entire
catalytic system of CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-4, because they prevent the
leaching of the potent metal ions from the catalyst surface as well
as increase the solubility of nanocatalysts CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-2 (Figure S5).

The most probable mechanism
of oxidation of alcohols by H2O2 in the presence
of nanocatalysts CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-2
involves two general steps. At first, the micelle structure will help
the nanocatalysts to trap the organic molecules in the micelle core
by dividing them into hundreds of small droplets providing a large
area of the contact surface of the organic starting materials with
the active site of the catalysts in an aqueous solution. In the next
step, the active site, that is, the metal centre of the catalyst,
plays the crucial role. According to previous proposals,28,29 the reaction mechanism involves generation of a highly unstable
metal-hydroperoxo species followed by an oxo-species. To obtain the
evidence of FeIII–OOH and MnIII–OOH
intermediates that can possibly undergo O–O bond cleavage to
generate a high-valent iron oxo and manganese oxo species, respectively,
we have focused our attention on trapping of [FeIIIL(OOH)]
and [MnIIIL(OOH)] (L = cyclohexane-1,2-diylbis(azanylylidene)bis(methanylylidene)bis(2,4-diXphenol))
after the addition of H2O2 to the corresponding
catalyst.

The reaction of a methanolic solution of each iron
complex 1–3 with 10 equiv of H2O2 led
to the formation of a purple species that was characterized by UV–vis
at −20 °C as the corresponding hydroperoxo intermediate.
The species comprising the FeIII–OOH unit absorb
around 550 nm. We show the UV–visible spectra of complex 1 as a representative of the three iron ones and that of complex 4 for the Mn ones, all after the reaction with H2O2. In the first case, the reaction of a CH3CN solution of 1 with 10 equiv of H2O2 at −20
°C led to the formation of a transient purple species characterized
by a band at 546 nm (Figure S6 (left) at the Supporting Information). This band can be assigned to an LMCT between
the hydroperoxo group and the Fe-III for Fe–OOH entity.30,31 Attempts to isolate L1FeIII–OOH species
as the crystalline material was futile; hence, the intermediate L1FeIII–OOH (Scheme 2) was characterized using various other techniques,
including ESI-MS and DFT calculations.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation
of the Formation of Metal Hydroperoxo Species
and Subsequent Conversion to Oxo Species
Similarly, in the case of 4, that is, MnL1,
addition
of 10 equiv H2O2 in a CH3CN solution
of MnL1 afforded a green intermediate L1MnIII–OOH with absorption bands at 385 and 425 nm, which
is similar to that of the previously reported manganese(III) hydroperoxo
complex.32 This intermediate species persisted
for several hours at 25 °C (Figure S7 at the Supporting Information).

[FeL1] (1) and [L1FeIII(OOH)], as well as [MnL1] (4) and [L1MnIII–(OOH)],
have been detected by ESI-MS.
In all cases CH3CN was used as the solvent. A major peak
at m/z = 513. 9358 amu has been
found for 1 [C20H16Cl4FeN2O2]+ (Figure S8 at the Supporting Information). After the addition of
10 equiv of H2O2 the ESI-MS spectrum (Figure
S8 at the Supporting Information) exhibits
a major peak at m/z = 685.4332 amu
which can be attributed to [L1FeIII(OOH)]K+ (C20H17Cl4FeN2O4)K+. Peak at m/z = 657.0252 amu can be attributed to the formation of [L1FeV(O)H2O]+ (Figure S9 at the Supporting Information).

Similarly, in
the case of [L1MnIII–(OOH)],
the ESI-spectrum of MnL1 (4) showed [C20H16Cl4MnN2O2]+ (Figure S10 at the Supporting Information). After addition of 10 equiv of H2O2 the ESI-MS
spectrum (Figure S11 at the Supporting Information) exhibits a major peak at m/z =
545.9350 amu, which can be attributed to [L1MnIII(OOH)]+ (C20H17Cl4MnN2O4)+.

2.1 Theoretical
Study on the Formation of Hydroperoxide
MS Intermediates
It has been experimentally checked that
Salen Fe(III) and Mn(III) complexes with Cl, Br, and I substituents
at the ortho and para positions of both aromatic rings of the Schiff
base ligand are able to oxidize different organic functionalities
using H2O2 as the oxidant. Among them, those
with Cl render better yields than those with Br and these better than
I complexes.22 In the assumption that the
size and electronic properties of the halogen affects the stability
of the hydroperoxo intermediates formed in the initial reaction stages,
it is useful to theoretically characterize these complexes and compute
their energy. However, it is not meaningful to compare the absolute
energy of chemical compounds made of different numbers or types of
atoms, so we have calculated the Gibbs energy associated with a common
process in which each an initial metal complex reacts with OOH– to render the corresponding hydroperoxo intermediate,
as schematically depicted in eq 1. 1  

Two spin
multiplicities are possible
for the Fe(III) and Mn(III) complexes, a low one with 2S + 1 = 2, 3, for Fe(III) and Mn(III), respectively, and a high one
with 2S + 1 = 6, 5, for Fe(III) and Mn(III), respectively. Figures S12–S15 collects the optimized
geometry of initial and hydroperoxo Fe(III) and Mn(III) complexes,
with high and low spin, in acetonitrile solution. At the high spin,
in Fe(III) hydroperoxide complexes the Schiff base acquires a dome
shape making all bonds between the metal and its coordinated atoms
longer than in the initial complexes. However, the distance between
ortho halogens reduces in hydroperoxide intermediates. Unlike for
Mn(III) high spin complexes, ortho halogens become further apart in
the hydroperoxo species than in the initial ones. At low spin, initial
Fe(III) complexes present a much more symmetric coordination around
the metal with bond distances shorter than in the corresponding high
spin counterparts. At both Fe(III) and Mn(III) low spin Fe(III) hydroxo
complexes, ortho halogens become further apart than in the initial
ones. Table S7 shows the absolute electronic
and Gibbs energies of all these complexes with both spin multiplicities,
whereas Table 2 displays
the relative electronic and Gibbs energies corresponding to the reactions
compactly displayed in eq 1 (calculated as the summation of the energy of the corresponding
product menus summation of the energy of the corresponding reactants
in eq 1). Data in Table S7 confirms that high spin complexes are
more stable than the corresponding low spin ones in all cases, so
high spin species have been considered as those involved in our process
of interest.

X = I	–47.2/–30.4	–36.1/–19.5	
In terms of both electronic and Gibbs
energies in acetonitrile
solution, all the hydroperoxide products are more stable than the
initial reactants, that is, the six reactions are exergonic at the
conditions considered in the calculation. Fe(III) complexes render
much more stable hydroperoxo intermediates than the Mn(III) ones.
Both electronic and Gibbs energies agree to show that the stabilization
of OOH complexes slightly increases from chlorine to bromine and iodine
complexes, in agreement with the experimental largest activity of
Cl catalysts. Geometries collected in Figures S12–S15 for the high spin complexes involved in the
studied processes show how the OOH group bonds closely to Fe(III)
and Mn(III). The increasing volume occupied by Cl, Br, and I substituents
slightly affects the relative position of both phenyl rings as well
as the repulsive interaction among the halogen groups. Obviously,
the larger the halogen, the larger this repulsion, as computationally
probed.

Because complex 1, that is, FeL1 among
the series of iron complexes and complex 4, that is,
MnL1Cl among the series of manganese ones, were the most
efficient in generating iron and manganese hydroperoxo species, respectively,
henceforth these two complexes were selected for surface modification
and further study regarding heterogeneous catalysis was performed
with them (Scheme 1).

3 Conclusions
This present study deals
with a green and sustainable synthetic
route for the oxidation of alcohols using magnetically separable nanocatalysts.
To be able to work in an aqueous medium and to avoid metal particle
lixiviation, we have successfully designed and synthesized CTAB-coated
Fe3O4 nanoparticles supporting iron and manganese
complexes previously confirmed as good homogeneous catalysts. The
magnetic character of the nanoparticles was not compromised with the
coating of the CTAB surfactant and, as a result, these catalysts could
be reused upto 6 oxidation cycles without any appreciable loss in
their catalytic activity (Figure 6). Actually, they have been successfully used for the
oxidation of a range of alcohols in an aqueous medium at room temperature.
The present approach of nanomaterial synthesis and catalytic oxidation
could serve as a greener alternative to the conventional oxidation
methods that involve toxic metal catalysts.

All chemicals
were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. Solvents
were dried according to standard procedures and distilled prior to
use.

Elemental analyses (carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen) were
performed using a PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra
(4000–500 cm–1) were recorded at 27 °C
using a PerkinElmer RXI FT-IR spectrophotometer with KBr pellets.
Electronic spectra (800–200 nm) were obtained at 27 °C
using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC with acetonitrile as the solvent and reference.
Thermal analyses (TG-DTA) were carried out on a Mettler Toledo (TGA/SDTA851)
thermal analyzer in flowing dinitrogen (flow rate: 30 cm3 min–1). Conductance of the methanolic solution
of complexes was measured using a SYSTRONICS 306 conductivity meter.
SEM measurements were carried out with a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission
microscope. X-ray powder diffraction was performed on a X’Pert-PRO
diffractometer monochromated Cu Kα radiation (40.0 kV, 30.0
mA) at room temperature. A vibrating sample magnetometer (EV-9, Microsense,
ADE) was utilized for obtaining the magnetization curves. Electrospray
mass spectra have been recorded on a WATERS Xevo G2-S QTof mass spectrometer
using high resolution mass spectrometry grade acetonitrile as the
solvent. The hydrodynamic diameters and ζ-potential of the gold

Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@dopa
nanoparticles were synthesized using methods previously reported.20−23 Fe3O4@dopa@FeL (HCAT-1) and Fe3O4@dopa@MnL (HCAT-2) were also synthesized
following earlier methods.20−23 CTAB-coated nanoparticles CHCAT-1 (CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@FeL) and CHCAT-2 (CTAB/Fe3O4@dopa@MnL) were prepared using the following procedure. An aqueous
solution of the cationic surfactant CTAB was initially prepared (conc
of CTAB = 0.89 × 10–3 mol L–1). HCAT-1 (1.2 g) and HCAT-2 (1.2 g) were
added separately to a 25 mL of the surfactant dissolved in water and
the final mixtures were rigorously stirred for 36 h at room temperature
and hence the dispersion obtained was centrifuged for 5 min at 11 000
rpm. The supernatant solution was discarded and the sediment was washed
twice with doubly distilled water followed by further washing with
acetone followed by drying overnight at room temperature (Scheme 1). The two final
coated solid samples namely CHCAT-1 and CHCAT-2 were then further
characterized.
