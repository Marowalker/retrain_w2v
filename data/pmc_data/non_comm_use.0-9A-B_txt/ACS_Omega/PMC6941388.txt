Small water clusters absorb heat and catalyze pivotal
atmospheric
reactions. Yet, experiments produced conflicting results on water
cluster distribution under atmospheric conditions. Additionally, it
is unclear which “phase transitions” such clusters exhibit,
at what temperatures, and what are their underlying molecular mechanisms.
We find that logarithmically small tails in the radial probability
densities of (H2O)n clusters
(n = 2 – 6) provide direct testimony for such
transitions. Using the best available water potential (MB-pol), an
advanced thermostating algorithm (g-BAOAB), and sufficiently
long trajectories, we map the “bifurcation”, “melting”,
and (hitherto unexplored) “vaporization” transitions,
finding that both melting and vaporization proceed via a “monomer
on a ring” conformer, exhibiting huge distance fluctuations
at the vaporization temperatures (Tv). Tv may play a role in determining the atmospheric
cluster size distribution such that the dimer and tetramer, with their
exceptionally low/high Tv values, are
under/over-represented in these distributions, as indeed observed
in nondestructive mass spectrometric measurements.

Introduction
Small water clusters, Wn ≡ (H2O)n,
are supposedly prevalent
in the atmosphere,1,2 catalyzing chemical reactions3,4 of profound environmental significance, such as acid rain formation,5 and absorbing heat radiated from the earth’s
surface, which contributes to global warming.1 Theoretical assessments of water cluster densities in the atmosphere
are commonly based on an equilibrium assumption that every cluster
can convert to any other cluster on the equilibration timescale.6−9 Under these conditions, the monomer dominates at all temperatures
and the cluster population diminishes nearly exponentially with n at all altitudes.8 This is
seemingly in agreement with rotation and vibrational spectroscopy,
which so far identified only the water dimer in water vapor under
ambient conditions10 and the trimer at
650 K.11 In contrast, various types of
“gentle” mass spectrometric methods (that avoid excessive
cluster fragmentation) suggest that humid air contains a wide distribution
of cluster sizes12−16 from which the monomer and dimer are conspicuously absent while
the tetramer probability is enhanced. There is no explanation to this
observation (nor to the stark differences between methods).

Water clusters have multiple conformers. At low temperatures (T), the most stable n ≤ 5 conformers
are cyclic, which is a manifestation of water’s cooperativity.17,18 Their average hydrogen-bond (HB) strength increases monotonically
up to n = 6, while the dissociation energy
(for Wn → Wn – 1 + W1) reaches a maximum for n = 4.18,19

The hexamer represents
the transition from monocyclic “two-dimensional”
to multicyclic “three-dimensional” structures.20 But what happens at higher T and are there stable water clusters in the tropospheric temperature
range (ca. 220–300 K)? “Many insightful spectroscopic
studies have been done at very low temperatures, ... conditions [that]
are far from those found in the much warmer atmosphere of Earth”.3 For example, vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT)
spectroscopy identified HB rearrangement events, such as the acceptor
switch (AS), interchange (I), and bifurcation rearrangements (B).21,23 The splittings in the VRT bands report on the tunneling barriers
of these events, but otherwise, there is no direct time or temperature
dependence in these data. Indeed, for neutral clusters, temperature
control is difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it recently became
possible to measure shifts in the IR OH bands of “warm”
neutral water clusters (up to rotational temperatures of 160 K).24

The large gap between the laboratory (∼160
K) and atmospheric
conditions (220–300 K) suggests turning to theory for advice.
In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can readily depict
the temperature dependence. For example, MD simulations of water clusters
observed a “melting transition” (at a melting temperature, Tm), for example, by using the empirical “Lindemann
criterion” for the root-mean-squared displacement (RMSD) of
the O atoms,25−29 from the heat capacity,29−34 or the Q4 order parameter.35 Unfortunately, there is a huge variability with the water model,34,36 which renders much of the current literature qualitative at best.
In addition, the molecular mechanism behind cluster melting is rarely
investigated,27 and finally, there is not
always a heat capacity maximum,27,34 hence no evidence for
any transition. Consequently, a more sensitive method for detecting
transitions is required.

While the literature focused on cluster
melting, there is hardly
any study of the analogous “vaporization transition”
(temperature Tv) where monomer dissociation
begins (Wn → Wn – 1 + W1). Indeed, Tv > 220 K implies that the cluster is stable in some
atmospheric
layers. However, melting simulations often restrain the system in
various ways to prevent dissociation;34 hence, such vital information is presently unavailable. In particular,
it is unknown whether vaporization has any characteristics of a phase
transition.

In terms of methodology, we have discovered a new
fundamental criterion
for determining the water cluster transition temperatures from (previously
unreported) logarithmically small tails in their OO radial distribution
function (RDF), g(r). We use these,
in conjunction with the most accurate water potential (see below),
for charting the HB rearrangements as a function of T and determining TB, Tm, and Tv. Although the (average)
HB strength increases up to the ring hexamer,18 we find that the tetramer is thermally the most stable cluster.
In particular, it is the only water cluster with Tv > 220 K, and therefore, it might play a major role
in
phenomena such as global warming and acid rain.

Methods
Accuracy Assessments
For the results to be relevant
to atmospheric science, the transition temperatures must be determined
within the atmospheric temperature range. We are particularly interested
in an accurate determination of the vaporization temperature because
a cluster is expected to be stable if T < Tv, where T is the outside air
temperature. Because we are not aware of experimental or computational
data of cluster vaporization, we test our methodology on the melting
transition. As a reference, we consider Tm for bulk ice. Different methods for determining the water potential
energy function (PEF) (e.g., empirical force fields vs density functional
theory (DFT)) show a huge variability (>200 K) in Tm.36 For example, the BLYP
and PBE exchange functionals of DFT give Tm = 411 and 417 K, respectively.37 Adding
dispersion corrects only a part of this error. For several of the
empirical PEFs, Tm is closer to 273 K
(the experimental value), but mostly because they were adjusted to
reproduce this value.38 Therefore, it is
not possible to determine how accurate the transition temperatures
predicted by empirical force fields are going to be for clusters,
where no experimental data exists. Further progress thus depends on
an accurate first-principles PEF for water.

A breakthrough in
accuracy was brought about with the development of many body (MB)
PEFs,38−40 such as the MB-pol of Paesani and co-workers.41,42 “At present, MB-pol achieves unprecedented accuracy in describing
water properties from the dimer to the condensed phase and is perhaps
one of the all-around best water models to date”.40 Our test, Table S1 in the Supporting Information, suggests that the MB-pol accuracy
in predicting water cluster energies is even better than previously
claimed (Figure 3 in
ref (41)). In particular,
we have also shown43 that with a suitable
correction to nuclear quantum effects (NQE), MB-pol reproduces the
intramolecular vibrational frequencies of small water clusters to
within about 5 cm–1 of the experimental values
(an order of magnitude better than previous results). Classical MB-pol
trajectories predict that Tm = 263.5 K
for bulk water,41 which is 9 K too low.

There are several additional error sources affecting the accuracy
of the simulations. First (Figures S1 and S2), classical MD at a constant particle number, volume, and temperature
(NVT) requires a stable integrator to eliminate errors from the thermostating
process. The recently developed g-BAOAB integrator was shown to be
“an order of magnitude more accurate for configurational averages
than existing alternatives”.44 Because
we also keep the timestep small (0.2 fs), the difference from conventional
Langevin dynamics exists but is not that large (Figure S3). Another factor is the length of the trajectory.
While it was previously observed that a 0.5 ns trajectory is sufficiently
long for the task,27 we have found that
detecting rare events near transition temperatures requires trajectories
of at least 3 ns (Figure S5). Undersampling
will cause shorter trajectories to overestimate the transition temperatures.

Finally, for classical MD simulations with light H atoms, it is
important to estimate the NQE on water cluster melting and vaporization.
Due to zero point energy and tunneling, the NQE can be large or negligible,
depending on the property studied and conditions.45 It is common to assume that, experimentally, the isotope
effect on water is a measure of its NQE. Table 1 shows the experimental melting and boiling temperatures of
bulk water isotopes under standard conditions (http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_properties.html). As the differences reduce sharply with mass, T2O is
already in the classical limit,46 suggesting
a 4.5 K decrease in Tm and 1.5 K decrease
in Tv due to NQE.

Table 1 Water Isotope Melting and Boiling
Temperatures at 101.325 kPa (in °C)
isotope	melting	boiling	
H2O	0.00	100.0	
D2O	3.82	101.40	
T2O	4.49	101.54	
Previously, a large NQE for bulk water melting (27
K) was calculated
from quantum path integral simulations on empirical, rigid water PEFs.47 This outcome is apparently due to inadequacies
in the PEF because when a flexible water model was parametrized on
the basis of quantum path integral simulations (q-TIP4P/F), the NQE
reduced to only 8 K.47 Extending these
calculations to isotope effects gave ΔTm ≡ Tm(T2O) – Tm(H2O) = 8.2 K,46 supporting the conjecture that the melting NQE ≈
ΔTm (experimentally 4.5 K).

For MB-pol, quantal simulations of bulk water melting have not
yet been performed, but its improved accuracy suggests NQE in the
range of 4.5 – 8 K (6 K on average). Classical MB-pol simulations
gave Tm that is already 9 K too low,41 and the NQE would further reduce it, resulting
in an underestimation of Tm by 9 + 6 =
15 K, which we term the “residual MB-pol error”.

Proceeding to the clusters, a quantum statistical simulation of
the water hexamer35 found about a 10 K
increase in Tm from (H2O)6 to (D2O)6. Based on Table 1, we add an estimated 20% for
(T2O)6, obtaining a 12 K NQE. By a direct comparison
of classical and quantal MB-pol simulations for (H2O)6, we find (below) NQE of ≈10 K. Thus, we estimate that
for correcting both the residual MB-pol error (+15 K) and the lack
of NQE in classical cluster simulations (−10 K), one should
add 5 K to our classical Tm values.

Performing quantum statistical simulations for equilibrium conformations
over the whole temperature range might be doable but will not produce
the time dependence, which is needed for determining the molecular
mechanisms underlying the transitions. While methods such as centroid
molecular dynamics (CMD) will generate the dynamics of quantal nuclei,
below 240 K they become highly inaccurate.48,49 Thus, quantal MD is presently not feasible. It is also not needed
at this stage as the NQE is small and we have established a procedure
for correcting it. Hence, we proceed with classical MD.

Computational Method Summary
We ran classical NVT MB-pol
trajectories for the Wn clusters (n = 2 – 6) using the g-BAOAB integrator for 3 ns
or more (see trajectory length column of Table S2). Excluding a brief equilibration period, we utilize the
oxygen atom coordinates to obtain the OO RDF, g(r), using the gofr function of VMD (ver. 1.9).50 For a liquid, g(r) → 1 at large r (uniform distribution).
For a finite cluster with no boundary conditions, g(r) → 0, and this allows to observe its logarithmically
small tails that would otherwise be submerged in the continuum.

We are interested in the radial probability density (RPD) P(r) ≡ r2g(r) that, up to normalization
by Z = ∫0∞r2g(r)-dr, is the probability
density for observing O atoms in a spherical shell around a chosen
O atom. P(r) for W2 and
W3 has a single peak so that <r >
≡
∫0∞rP(r)-dr/Z is the average HB length. For W4 and W5, there are two well-separated peaks corresponding to the
first- and second-shell neighbors, while most W6 isomers
have three solvation shells. In these cases, the HB length is obtained
by restricting the integrals to the first solvation shell.

Often, g(r) or P(r) are fitted to a Gaussian function, which is
inadequate for markedly anharmonic HBs. Anharmonicity leads to asymmetric
distributions, which were shown51 to be
adequately described by the skewed normal distribution (SND) 1  where x ≡
(r – μ)/σ and erf(x) is the error function (note the missing  in ref (51)). The four parameters, A, μ,
σ, and ξ, obtained from fitting eq 1 to the simulated P(r), are
presented in Tables S3–S8. A is for normalization, μ is the peak location, σ
is its width, and ξ is its asymmetry. Due to it, the average r is 2  

The SND is fitted to
each RPD peak separately. For the first peak,
ξ > 0 increases with T; μ decreases
but
<r> always increases with increasing T.51 These smooth variations
represent
thermal expansion in which HBs continuously lengthen, whereas HB rearrangements
manifest themselves as upward deviations from the SND with abrupt
onsets (“transitions”). Thus, the SND serves as a reference
whose subtraction from P(r) defines
the RPD tails.

Results and Discussion
Inadequacy of Current Methodologies
As discussed in
the Introduction, temperature-dependent structural
transitions in water clusters were usually elucidated using either
caloric curves or the Lindemann criterion. Caloric curves depict <E> versus T, and their slopes, CV = (∂<E>/∂T)V, are the constant volume
heat capacities. A maximum in CV(T) characterizes a phase transition.29−34Figure 1 shows that
the caloric curves for n = 2 – 6
are actually linear, and hence, CV is
constant (which depends on n, see inset). Note that
the temperature range extends to above Tv, and yet, there is no indication for any transition. Sometimes,
the averaged potential energy is used,29,30,32 and Figure S4 shows a
linear behavior in this case as well. Considering the Lindemann criterion,
we have calculated both <r> and <r2> as a function of T (where r is the OO distance), finding that these RPD moments can
show transitions under certain conditions (see Computational Methods in the Supporting Information). Nevertheless,
this evidence alone is not always sufficient (Figure S6).

classical
g-BAOAB trajectories using the MB-pol PEF for W2 (black
bars), W3 (red triangles), W4 (green squares),
W5 (blue circles), and W6 (cyan asterisks).
The best-fit linear functions are shown as lines, with their equations
written near each line. The black asterisks in the inset are the slopes
of the five lines, d<E>/dT kJ/(mol
K), seen to be a linear function of n. An analogous
plot for the average potential energy is given in Figure S4.

RDF Tails
Since the RPD moments do not always show
the transitions, we have considered the full distribution. The top
panels in Figure 2 show
the computed OO RPD for W4 at two values of T. As expected, there are two peaks corresponding to nearest and second-nearest
neighbors. While on a linear scale there seems to be nothing unexpected
with P(r), on a logarithmic scale
(bottom panels) we observe low amplitude tails that extend to large
distances. We shall now show that the emergence of these tails marks
the onset of new HB rearrangement events, particularly those connected
with cluster melting and vaporization.

Figure 2 (Top) linear vs (bottom)
logarithmic plots of the RPD for the water
tetramer (red line) at two different temperatures (calculated from
3 ns MB-pol trajectories using the g-BAOAB integrator). The tails
extend beyond SND2 (blue), namely, the SND fit to the second RPD peak.
Note that even the relatively heavy tail at 239 K is easily missed
in the linear plot.

Water Dimer
We first exemplify the analysis for W2. Figure 3A shows P(r) at the onset temperatures for the AS, I, and B events (i.e., the
lowest T where these are observed in our 3 ns trajectories,
see Movies S1–S3), which are denoted by TAS, TI and TB, respectively. Figure 3B shows their atomistic
depiction and estimated barriers according to VRT spectroscopy.22 AS corresponds to the donor H atom switching
between the two lone-pairs of the acceptor. An I event switches the
roles of the donor and acceptor by concerted rotation, while B exchanges
the two donor H atoms via a bifurcated HB. Figure 3A also shows P(r) at the melting (Tm) and vaporization
(Tv) temperatures, with vaporization dynamics
depicted in Movie S4.

seen in the water dimer. (A) Logarithmically
scaled r2g(r) at TAS, TI, TB, Tm,
and Tv (red lines). Blue lines show fits
to eq 1 with parameters
in Table S3. (B) Schematic depiction of
the AS, I, and B events (with their VRT activation barriers)22 and the long excursions taken by water molecules
near Tv.

At 20 K (not shown) P(r) coincides
with the SND, but at 30 K there are slight upward deviations due to
the onset of AS (Movie S1). This disturbs
the HB structure very mildly, with the donor H atom sliding along
the electron density connecting the two lone pairs.52 The I and B onsets occur at 40 and 50 K, respectively,
as verified from Movies S2 and S3. For W2, B is actually composed
of two consecutive I events, written schematically as  We term this an “I-assisted”
B-event. Here the initial geometry is as in Figure S1 of ref (43), H2′ being the
free H atom of the HB donor. It interchanges with H2 via two concerted
rotations.

While these onset temperatures may decrease when
NQEs are included,
their classical values are interesting because they reflect the barrier
heights. Indeed, we find that TI/TAS = 40/30, identical to the VRT barrier height
ratio, 207/157 = 1.32. However, TB/TI = 50/40 < 394/207 = 1.9, hence, I assistance
results in a smaller barrier as compared to pure B events. The general
agreement with the VRT HB rearrangements at low T and their order of appearance raise hopes that the experimentally
inaccessible melting and vaporization transitions are also properly
described by the present theory.

The first moment of P(r), <r> (the HB
length), is shown in Figure 4 (W2). Up to TB, <r> increases linearly with T, which
represents thermal HB expansion without the HB
cleavage (i.e., the effect of AS and I on this curve is negligible).
Near TB, we observe a small increase in
slope (dashed ochre line). At higher T, two new HB
rearrangement events induce larger slope changes. We attribute the
one near Tm = 110 K to “melting”.
Here, we observe more rapid HB rearrangements so that the large r tail extends beyond the SND into distances characterizing
second-shell water molecules (Figure 3A, 110 K).

Figure 4 Average OO distance, <r>
(<r2>), in W2 and W3 (W4 and W5) (red symbols). Calculated
from ∫rmin∞rP(r)dr/∫rmin∞P(r)dr, where rmin = 0 for <r1> and 3.26
Å (3.40 Å) for <r2> of
W4 (W5) (see Figure S6). Lines are piecewise linear fits (Figure S7) with parameters presented in Table S9: up to TB (bold ochre),
between TB and Tm (dashed ochre), between Tm and Tv (dashed blue), and above Tv (dashed red). Gray circles depict eq 2 with parameters obtained by fitting eq 1 to the first (second)
peak of P(r) for W2/W3 (W4/W5).

Of particular interest is the vaporization transition
at Tv ≈ 140 K. It is the most conspicuous,
with both an abrupt increase in slope and a jump in <r> (Figure 4). The
large r tail extends beyond 10 Å (Figure 3A), even when the pair does
not eventually separate to infinity. As Movie S4 shows, the pair may return to HB distances so that the “volume”
of the cluster undergoes huge fluctuations near Tv, which is reminiscent of the volume fluctuations at
the critical point of bulk liquids.53 Above Tv, the cluster lifetimes diminish rapidly with
increasing T (Table S2). For W2, Tv is exceptionally
low, which might explain its absence from the mass spectra of water
vapor in which care was taken to eliminate cluster fragmentation.12−16

The Cyclic Clusters, Trimer to Pentamer
The lowest
energy isomers for n = 3 – 5 are cyclic, with
monotonically increasing HB strengths.18 Thus, one might expect the transition temperatures to increase monotonically
with n. Figure 5 shows P(r) for these
three clusters from which the onset of bifurcation, melting, and vaporization
can be gleaned as upward deviating tails in comparison to the SND.
Contrary to the above expectation, all transition temperatures are
higher for W4 than for the other clusters, with W5 behaving similarly to W3. This is corroborated by the
changes of slope in Figure 4. In particular, only W4 has a Tv within the tropospheric temperature range.

Figure 5 Logarithmically
scaled P(r) (red
lines) from MB-pol simulations for (A–D) W3, (E–H)
W4, and (I–L) W5 near TB (A, E, I), near Tm (B, F,
J), just below Tv (C, G, K), and just
above Tv (D, H, L). Blue lines show fits
to eq 1 with parameters
in Tables S4–S8.

While in W3 all three O atoms are first-shell
neighbors,
in W4/W5, there are second-shell neighbors as
manifested by the doubly peaked P(r) in Figure 5. Because
the tails extend here beyond the second shell, we show in the bottom
panels of Figure 4 the
average r for the second shell, <r2>. It is indeed more sensitive to the transitions
than
the overall <r> (see Figure S6). Two exceptional behaviors are noted in Figure 4. First, for W4,
there is a negligible change in slope of <r2> at TB (b for
“solid1” vs “solid2” in Table S9). Rather, B is noted in filling up the trough between
the two peaks in Figure 5E. Experimentally, all clusters showed the B rearrangement except
W4.21 The simulations do show
B events also for W4 (Movie S5). Possibly, TB (hence the B barrier)
is too high to manifest itself in the VRT lines. Secondly, for W5, <r2> decreases with T, in contrast to W4 (and to <r1>). This may be due to the deviation of the W5 ring from planarity (ca. 50) that may increase
with T, thus reducing <r2>.

The melting transition (Movies S6–S8) is manifested by the
low amplitude tail in P(r) extending
to OO distances characteristic
of second- (W3) and third-shell (W4/W5) water neighbors (Figure 5B, F, J). As T increases further, a plateau
develops due to open chains having no clear minima (W3)
and/or populating higher energy isomers with third-shell neighbors
(W5). However, up to Tv, the
tails stop abruptly around 7–8 Å (Figure 5C, G, K), as if there is a small residual
barrier preventing complete dissociation.

At Tv, new OO tails appear, extending
to notably larger distances (Figure 5D, H, L), resulting from the huge fluctuations in cluster
volume (Movies S9 and S10), and reminiscent of critical behavior in bulk water.53 The long-range intermolecular forces between
water molecules in the clusters extend to 10–12 Å. Thus,
the spectacle of dissociation reversal at larger distances arises
exclusively from the thermal “bath” in the NVT ensemble.
The thermostat mimics an inert gas with a Boltzmann distribution of
velocities and, at the transition, the dissociating pair recedes at
sufficiently low velocities that can be reversed by the thermal collisions.

This can be further clarified by a depiction of a real time trajectory
just above Tv (Figure 6). This trajectory first undergoes dissociation
reversal (near 0.3 ns). However, the ultimate fate at T > Tv is the evaporation of a monomer,
leaving behind the tetrameric fragment, and this occurs near 6.26
ns. Shortly thereafter, their separation is nearly reversed, but a
final collision sends the fragments off to distances from which they
never recombine. The raggedness of the receding pair path is due to
the thermal collisions, and indeed, at constant energy (NVE ensemble),
the separation proceeds at constant relative velocity (not shown).

Figure 6 An exemplary
trajectory of W5 dissociation at 219 K, W5 → W4 + W1, just above its vaporization temperature
(210 K), showing the time dependence of the distance between the centers
of mass of the W4 and W1 fragments. (a) Short
time segment showing dissociation reversal from over 40 Å, leading
to the long-distance tail observed in P(r). The inset shows a magnification thereof. (b) Behavior at longer
times shows dissociation with no subsequent reversals.

Clearly, above Tv,
the cluster has
a finite lifetime (here, 6.26 ns). As Tv is approached from above, the lifetime becomes longer until it diverges
at Tv. The trajectory length in Table S2 is an integer number below Tv meaning that it has completed its preset lifetime without
dissociating. At Tv, the signature for
vaporization is attempted dissociation with concomitant reversal,
manifested statistically as long-distance tails of P(r) (Figure 5L). Because the reversal is a random event, such clusters
are bound to dissociate at sufficiently long times.

Transition Temperatures
For AS, I, and B, the transition
temperatures were deduced by visualizing the low-temperature trajectories,
searching for the lowest T at which each event appears.
For melting and vaporization, the transition temperatures were determined
from the first appearance of the RDF tails (Figure 5), agreeing semiquantitatively with the temperatures
at which a change of slope occurs in Figure 4. This is summarized in Table 2.

d Sole previous MD study reporting
multiple transitions found for W5: TAS = 35 K, TB = 120 K, and Tm = 150 K.27

Bifurcation, melting, and vaporization involve momentary
or more
permanent HB cleavage events, and thus, TB, Tm, and Tv show a similar n dependence (Table 2), with the transition temperatures notably
higher for the tetramer than for the other clusters. For Tv, this could have been anticipated from the qualitative
trend in monomer dissociation energies,18,19 but quantitative
results for high T are difficult to obtain from 0
K quantum chemistry calculations. To check this, consider the high-accuracy
CCSD(T)/CBS calculations of Temelso et al.19 for the free energy change, ΔG(T), for Wn → Wn – 1 + W1 at 1 atm pressure, using scaled harmonic frequencies
and assuming that the reaction occurs from the average Wn isomer. From the equilibrium condition ΔG(Tv) = 0, we obtain, by interpolating
in Table 5 of ref (19), Tv = 190, 250, 316, 291, and 226 K
for n = 2,...6, respectively. While the trend is
the same as in Table 2, these temperatures are markedly higher. Of course, the two calculations
are not precisely the same, as we only simulate the dissociation reaction
in vacuum (and not the recombination), albeit with the accurate anharmonicities
embedded in MB-pol. However, it is possible that the largest discrepancy
arises from Boltzmann averaging ΔG over all
the 0 K isomers,19 whereas the reactions in Table 2 occur from excited conformations having
lower dissociation barriers (see the vaporization mechanism below).
This two-step pathway is preferable when the excitation energy is
lower than the ground state barrier, leading to the lower Tv values (and showing that for quantitative
results, there is no alternative to the dynamical approach).

Underlying Molecular Mechanisms for Melting and Vaporization
Figure 7 shows a
sequence of HB rearrangements for W4 near Tm (Movie S7). First, a ring
HB temporarily cleaves, generating a chain with two free H atoms at
one end. One of these attacks the next nearest water, producing a
cyclic trimer with one external water molecule donating an HB to it
(the “3 + 1 isomer” in Figure 7B). This singly HBed molecule undergoes facile
rotation to become an HB acceptor (panel C). Now, it has two free
H atoms, one of which attacks the next nearest neighbor regenerating
a W4 ring in which two water molecules have been exchanged
(Figure 7D). Thus,
the tetramer is the smallest entity in which water exchange occurs,
a predecessor of water self-diffusion in the bulk.

Figure 7 Possible sequence of
HB rearrangements leading to water monomer
exclusion from the tetrameric ring (A–C) followed by (D) exchange
(Tm and above) or (E) vaporization (Tv and above). Double-headed arrows depict HB
cleavage whereas single headed arrows depict HB formation.

Near Tv, the HB of
the external water
molecule elongates, leading to dissociation by a single HB cleavage.
If vaporization was a one-step reaction involving double HB cleavage,
one would expect Tv ≈ 2Tm. As can be seen in Table 2, this is not the case. For W4, Tv is just 20% higher than Tm, which is explained by the two-step mechanism,
each step governed by a single HB cleavage.

The Hexamer
This cluster has a plethora of low lying
isomers (see Figure 1A in ref (35)). It
is the smallest water cluster whose lowest energy isomer (the cage
isomer) has a 3D structure, rather than being a planar ring. The tetramer
stability is manifested in the hexamer low-lying isomers (cage, prism,
and book), which are composed from several tetrameric rings. Next,
in order of stability, is a group of isomers constructed of a pentameric
ring with a water monomer forming two HBs to it. As of 90 K, we observe
structures from this group of isomers. At 110 – 120 K, the
sixth water molecule cleaves one of its HBs, remaining bound through
a single HB (“5 + 1” structure, see Movie S11). This is likely the origin of the tail seen, for
example, in Figure 8A at 119 K. Quantum statistical MB-pol simulations of (H2O)6 found a melting transition between 90 and 120 K (average
105 K).35 Our classical MD value is about
10 K higher, in excellent agreement with the 12 K NQE deduced
(Methods) from the isotope effect on Tm. It is also in excellent agreement with Tm= 116 K obtained using the TIP4P-ice water
model,34 which (contrary to MB-pol) has
been parametrized to reproduce the experimental melting point of bulk
ice.

Figure 8 Logarithmically scaled P(r) from
MB-pol simulations of the water hexamer (A) near the melting temperature
and (B) near the vaporization temperature. The dynamics giving rise
to the pronounced tail (cyan line) just above Tv are depicted by Movie S12. The
starting geometry in these simulations is that of the cage isomer.

The hexamer vaporization temperature is around
205 K (see Figure 8B). In spite of its
3D structure, we find a similar dissociation mechanism: W6 dissociates from a “5 + 1” structure, similar to W5 and W4 dissociating from “4 + 1”
and “3 + 1” structures, respectively. Movie S12 shows the dynamics at 214 K (just above Tv), with the water monomer making long excursions
(up to 25 Å) before returning to a book structure. In this example,
dissociation did not occur up to t = 3 ns (the preset
trajectory length), but we know it must occur at some later time,
when thermal collisions do not succeed in reversing the dissociation
attempt.

Conclusions
We have presented a first detailed dynamical
description of thermal
structural rearrangements of small water clusters (Wn = 2 – 6) with a reliable PEF, from
the low-temperature AS, I, and B events and up to vaporization, when
the cluster disintegrates. We have introduced a new operational measure
for the melting and vaporization transitions, manifested by logarithmically
small tails of the RDF. For n = 4 – 6, these
tails are attributed to the formation of an (n –
1) ring structure to which a monomer is attached. At Tm, such structures first appear, whereas at Tv, the single HB connecting the monomer to Wn – 1 cleaves. For W4,
this mechanism (“3 + 1”) is the least favorable because
it produces a strained W3 ring. As a result, both Tm and Tv are notably
higher for W4 than for the other clusters.

The first
appearance of the RDF tails is a particularly accurate
monitor of vaporization, offering a first quantitative determination
of Tv for water clusters. Tv marks the threshold of cluster stability toward unimolecular
dissociation and thus has characteristics of a phase transition, as
manifested also by the abrupt change in <rOO> vs T and the critical-like distance
fluctuations.
Interestingly, all investigated clusters have their Tv below the atmospheric temperature window except the
tetramer for which, after corrections (Methods), Tv ≈ 245 K.

The Persistent Tetramer
Theoretical assessments of
water cluster densities in the atmosphere are commonly based on an
equilibrium assumption that every cluster can convert to any other
cluster on the equilibration timescale,6−9  Our results cast doubts on
the equilibrium assumption in the sense that some of the rate constants
in this scheme vanish. First, Table S2 shows
that the dimer at 180 K is already very short-lived, so by 220 K,
it will not live long enough for undergoing bimolecular collisions.
Generally speaking, a typical molecule experiences about 1010 collisions per second at standard pressure and 25 °C,54 so that the typical time between collisions
is larger than 100 ps. Hence, the dimer at 220 K will not form trimers
and will dissociate faster than two water monomers collide. Second,
for T ≤ 245 K, the reaction W4 →
W3 + W1 would cease to occur. Thus, the cluster
distribution is expected to be depleted in dimers and enriched in
tetramers, as indeed observed in the “gentle” mass spectrometric
measurements of water cluster distributions in humid air.12−16

More quantitative work for unraveling water cluster distributions
in the atmosphere could involve the simulation of a large number of
MB-pol water molecules in the gas phase for various densities and
temperatures. Such simulations could test the hypothesis that, under
appropriate conditions, the tetramer is an important atmospheric “workhorse”,
absorbing IR radiation in its expanded ring system, energy which becomes
available for carrying out chemical reactions.
