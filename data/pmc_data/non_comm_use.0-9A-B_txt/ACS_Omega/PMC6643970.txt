Liquid-to-air membrane
energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are promising
in heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning applications because
they are able to use semipermeable membranes to transfer heat and
moisture between air and liquid desiccant streams. However, the development
of crystallization fouling in membranes may pose a great risk to the
long-term performance of LAMEEs. The main aim of this paper is to
characterize the evolution of crystallization fouling in membranes
through the use of both noninvasive and invasive methods. Noninvasive
methods are used to study the development of fouling in the LAMEE
by monitoring the changes in moisture flux through the membrane and
overall moisture-transfer resistance of the LAMEE. On the other hand,
invasive methods are implemented to characterize fouled membranes
by using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
to depict the morphology of crystal deposits and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to identify the composition of the deposits.
Experiments are performed by using air to dehydrate MgCl2(aq) at two operating conditions of low and high fouling rates. The
results show that the moisture flux decreases and the moisture-transfer
resistance increases more considerably during the test at the high
fouling rate than in the test at the low fouling rate. SEM micrographs
show that cake crystal deposits cover the membrane surface in the
test at the high fouling rate, whereas only few crystal particles
are observed on the membrane in the test at the low fouling rate.
Furthermore, the crystal deposits undergo more structural changes
in the tests at the high fouling rate than in the tests at the low
fouling rate, possibly because of the higher moisture transfer rate
through the membrane in the tests at the high fouling rate. Finally,
the SEM–EDX analysis confirms that the crystal deposits primarily
consist of Mg, Cl, and O elements.

==== Body
1 Introduction
1.1 Motivation
Fouling can be defined
as the amassing and attachment of unwanted matter to surfaces, such
as in heat exchangers1 or membranes.2 Fouling affects over 90% of industrial heat exchangers3 and degrades the overall heat-transfer coefficient4 and effectiveness5 of heat exchangers because of the additional resistance to heat
transfer caused by the buildup of deposits on surfaces. Fouling can
also reduce the quantity of fluid that passes through membranes when
substances are deposited internally within the pores of membranes
or externally on membrane surfaces.2

Fouling results in extra energy consumption and costs due to overdesigned
exchangers, cleaning, maintenance, and production losses.3,6−10 The increase in energy and material consumption caused by fouling
leads to an increase in the amount of CO2 emissions released
into the environment and reduces the sustainability of industrial
processes. For instance, a 300 μm-thick fouling layer in the
condenser of a power plant reportedly increased CO2 emissions
by 23 tons per day.11 In addition, it has
been estimated that fouling in crude oil refineries worldwide accounts
for about 2.5% of the global CO2 emissions caused by humans.12

Fouling has a significant impact on the
economy of industries and
nations. A 30–40% increase in the area of a heat exchanger
because of fouling can increase the capital cost of the exchanger
by 25%.13 Xu et al.6 conducted an economic evaluation of a coal-fired power plant in
China in 2000 and found that fouling resulted in a 29% increase in
heat-transfer surface area. A recent estimate of the national economic
cost of fouling reported that heat exchanger fouling costs 0.25–0.35%
of the gross national product of industrialized countries.14 Consequently, in 2016, fouling accounts for
up to US$ 6 billion in Canada and US$ 66 billion in the USA based
on data from The World Bank Group.15,16 It should
be noted that the costs associated with fouling may be higher for
a rapidly developing nation like China because of the substantial
market demand14 and high rate of industrialization
in the country.

1.2 Fouling Detection Methods
Several
methods are used to detect and monitor fouling in heat and membrane
exchangers. These fouling detection methods can be broadly categorized
into noninvasive and invasive methods. Invasive methods interrupt
the operation of equipment to inspect the existence of fouling and
are unsuitable for real-time inspection of exchangers. However, noninvasive
methods can be used to detect fouling without disrupting processes
and are useful for real-time monitoring of fouling growth. An overview
of fouling detection methods is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Classification of fouling detection methods.
Note: The methods
are compiled from refs.7,11,17−58

Figure 1 shows various
noninvasive and invasive methods, which are further divided into subcategories
that include lists of specific methods. As an example, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) is an invasive method that is classified under the
“imaging” subcategory because it can be used to image
the surface of a material to detect the presence of fouling deposits.
Experimental measurements (such as moisture flux or temperature) are
noninvasive methods that are placed under the “parameter”
subcategory. Parameters can be used to indirectly detect or monitor
fouling because they indicate the impact of deposit accumulation on
the performance of exchangers. Decision-based techniques are another
example of noninvasive methods. Decision-based techniques are classified
under the “analysis” subcategory and can be used to
detect fouling by analyzing process parameters (e.g., moisture flux).

1.3 Research Gaps
This paper addresses
the limited application of noninvasive and invasive methods to systematically
identify the evolution of: (i) fouling in heat and membrane exchangers
for diverse applications and (ii) crystallization fouling in membrane
exchangers for heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) applications.

1.3.1 Fouling in Heat and Membrane Exchangers
in Diverse Applications
Few studies have used both noninvasive
and invasive methods to characterize the evolution of fouling.42,59 However, many studies have used only noninvasive methods to observe
how fouling evolves,37,40,46,49,52,53,60−62 and some of these studies37,46,49 subsequently used invasive methods (e.g., SEM) to characterize the
morphology of fouling deposits after a test (and not during the test).

Although noninvasive methods can be used for real-time observation
of fouling, they do not provide information on how the boundary conditions
at the membrane interface affect the morphological transformations
of the fouling deposits. Consequently, both noninvasive and invasive
methods are needed to thoroughly understand the evolution of fouling
in membranes. The application of both noninvasive and invasive methods
to study the evolution of fouling is systematically pursued in this
paper.

1.3.2 Crystallization Fouling in Membrane Exchangers
for HVAC Applications
This paper also focuses on fouling
in membrane-based exchangers for HVAC applications. This is because
membranes are progressively gaining acceptance in HVAC technologies,
e.g., air-to-air membrane energy recovery ventilators.63,64 In addition, membranes can potentially reduce the energy consumption
of HVAC equipment,63 and HVAC systems consume
about half of the energy used in buildings and one-fifth of the total
energy produced in developed countries.65

The membrane exchanger studied in this paper is called a liquid-to-air
membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE). Unlike conventional heat exchangers
that can only transfer heat between fluid streams, the LAMEE can transfer
heat and moisture between air and liquid desiccant streams using a
semipermeable membrane.66−68 However, crystals may precipitate
from the desiccant solution and accumulate within the membrane and
degrade the performance of the LAMEE.69

In a recent study by the authors,69 the
rate of moisture transfer through the membrane was identified as a
key parameter that influences the likelihood of crystallization fouling
in LAMEEs. However, the effect of moisture-transfer rate on the evolution
of crystallization fouling in membranes was not assessed in the same
study.69 In addition, the papers on crystallization
fouling in LAMEEs27,49,69 have neither methodically identified the changes in the morphology
of deposits during a fouling test nor determined the composition of
deposits on fouled membranes.

1.4 Research
Objectives
The main aim
of this paper is to characterize the evolution of crystallization
fouling in membranes. The specific objectives of this paper are to1. Identify
the evolution of crystallization
fouling in membranes using noninvasive and invasive methods.

2. Identify the composition
and structure
of deposits on membranes using invasive methods.



2 Theoretical Background
Crystallization
fouling primarily involves the precipitation of
ions from a salt solution and subsequent attachment to a surface.70 Crystallization fouling is frequently encountered
in industrial processes and is also known as scaling70 or encrustation,71 because it
sometimes results in the attachment of precipitates to surfaces. The
mechanisms of crystallization fouling kinetics are influenced by several
interrelated parameters.71,72 Some parameters that
influence crystallization fouling include the properties of solutions
(concentration, pH), bulk and surface fluids (temperature, velocity),
and materials (roughness, surface energy).2,14,48,73,74

2.1 Mechanisms of Crystallization
Fouling
The primary condition for crystallization is the
supersaturation
of an aqueous solution.14,73,75 The supersaturation of a solution can be achieved by diverse means,
including evaporating a solution above its saturation concentration,
cooling a normally soluble solution below its saturation temperature
or heating an inversely soluble solution above its saturation temperature,
modifying the pH of a solution, and mixing solutions that can precipitate
their ions.76−78 Although supersaturation is an essential requirement,
it does not inevitably lead to crystallization.14

The supersaturation of an aqueous solution may be
succeeded by nucleation. Nucleation can be classified into primary
or secondary types,77 and primary nucleation
can either be homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogenous nucleation involves
the spontaneous formation of nuclei in a supersaturated solution without
the presence of foreign particles or surface defects, whereas heterogeneous
nucleation is often triggered by the presence of surface imperfections
or impurities in a solution.14,77 Bott suggested that
heterogeneous nucleation is more likely to be the cause of crystallization
fouling in heat exchangers in the industry,77 possibly because the total change in free energy required for heterogeneous
nucleation is less than that of homogenous nucleation.75 Secondary nucleation is initiated by seeded
crystals in a solution, as opposed to primary nucleation which does
not require the presence of crystals to occur.75

Nuclei can begin to grow if they exceed their critical
size after
nucleation.75 Crystal growth can be explained
by three main theories based on surface energy, adsorption layer,
and diffusion.77 The surface energy theory
postulates that the lowest surface energy controls the development
of crystals, whereas the adsorption layer theory suggests that the
crystal growth is intermittent and takes place by the buildup of crystal
layers.77 However, the diffusion theory
is often applied to explain crystal growth in heat exchanger fouling.72,76,77,79 The diffusion theory states that the development of crystals may
be primarily controlled by diffusion mass transfer, surface reaction
integration, or a combination of both mechanisms depending on the
operating condition.72 Mass diffusion is
driven by the difference between the bulk and interface concentrations,
whereas surface reaction integration is controlled by difference between
the saturation and interface concentrations.77

2.2 Crystallization Fouling in a LAMEE
As previously
stated, a LAMEE is a liquid-to-air membrane exchanger
which can be used to condition the temperature and humidity of an
air stream without direct contact between the air stream and the liquid
desiccant. During the operation of a LAMEE, the operating condition
may favor the seeding of crystals in the liquid desiccant, and the
crystals may block the membrane pores or form a layer on the membrane
surface. Figure 2 shows
the possible mechanisms of the development of crystallization fouling
in a LAMEE during the dehydration of a liquid desiccant solution.

Figure 2 Development
of crystallization fouling in a LAMEE (adapted from
ref (80)).

In Figure 2, the
first phase is stage 1. Stage 1 depicts the operation of a LAMEE without
the presence of fouling. As air flows on one side of the LAMEE, the
difference in the water vapor concentration (humidity ratio) between
the air and solution sides initiates the evaporation of water from
the desiccant solution. Afterward, moisture diffuses through the membrane
pores into the air stream. In Figure 2, stage 1 is also shown in the form of a resistance
circuit, in which the LAMEE consists of liquid-side, membrane, and
air-side moisture-transfer resistances.

The LAMEE may progress
to stage 2 as moisture continuously evaporates
from the desiccant solution, and the solution concentration increases
until supersaturation occurs at the solution–membrane interface.
Crystals may directly nucleate inside the membrane pores and obstruct
the permeation of moisture through the membrane. In stage 2, a resistance
is added to the LAMEE because of internal fouling from crystals that
accumulate in the membrane pores.

It is possible for the growth
of crystals in the LAMEE to reach
stage 3, where crystals agglomerate and form a cake layer on the membrane
surface. The formation of crystal cakes on the membrane surface is
known as external fouling because the deposits accumulate on the membrane
surface and are not lodged within the pores. Furthermore, a high rate
of crystal development may shorten the phase of internal fouling in
stage 2 and rapidly evolve into external fouling in stage 3. However,
internal fouling does not necessarily lead to external fouling, and
both mechanisms may occur either independently or simultaneously.
In stage 3, the LAMEE consists of two additional resistances from
internal and external fouling.

The presence of fouling in the
LAMEE at stage 2 (internal fouling)
and stage 3 (internal and external fouling) is expected to reduce
the moisture flux through the membrane and increase the overall moisture-transfer
resistance of the LAMEE. It should be noted that the development of
crystallization fouling along the vertical cross section of a membrane
as described in stages 2 and 3 are provided for description purposes
and will not be examined in this paper.

3 Methodology
In this section, a test facility that is developed to test crystallization
fouling in LAMEEs is first presented (Section 3.1). Second, the properties of the membrane
used in the LAMEE are highlighted (Section 3.2). Third, the noninvasive and invasive
methods that are used to characterize the evolution of crystallization
fouling in membranes are presented in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.

3.1 Test Facility
A test facility is
constructed to test the LAMEE under different operating conditions
in order to examine the development of crystallization fouling in
membranes. The LAMEE uses an air stream with a lower moisture content
to dehydrate a stationary liquid desiccant solution. As previously
explained (see Section 2.2), the continuous removal of moisture from the liquid desiccant
can lead to crystallization fouling in the membrane. A schematic of
the complete test facility is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic of the test facility.69 Note:
The schematic consists of the (a) upstream section, LAMEE, and downstream
section of the test facility, (b) side-view cross-section of the LAMEE,
and (c) arrangement of perforated holes on the inner pipe of the LAMEE.
The diagrams are not drawn to scale.

Figure 3 shows
(a)
an overview of the test facility (upstream section, LAMEE, and downstream
section), (b) side-view cross section of the LAMEE, and (c) configuration
of holes on the inner pipe of the LAMEE. The pipes that are used to
construct the LAMEE are impermeable to moisture transfer. Therefore,
holes are drilled into the inner pipe of the LAMEE to facilitate the
exchange of moisture between the air stream and desiccant solution
(see Figure 3c). The
operational procedure of the test facility and the details of its
instrumentation, uncertainty analysis, and mass and energy balances
are documented in ref (69).

The test facility can be used to test crystallization fouling
in
the LAMEE under different operating conditions by varying the air
relative humidity and solution concentration. In this paper, fouling
is studied under two operating conditions that are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Test Operating Conditions
parameter and unit	condition 1 (high fouling rate)	condition 2 (low fouling rate)	
relative humidity of air,
RHair [%]	10 ± 1	30 ± 2	
dimensionless solution concentration, Csol*a [-]	∼1.03 (supersaturated)	∼1.0 (saturated)	
temperature of air and desiccant
solution [°C]	23 ± 2	 	
a Csol* is the ratio
of the concentration of a desiccant solution to its saturated concentration.

In Table 1, Condition
1 has a higher fouling rate than Condition 2. This is because the
moisture-transfer rate is higher for Condition 1 because the air stream
is at a lower relative humidity (RHair = 10%) compared
with Condition 2 where RHair = 30%. In addition, Condition
1 involves the use of supersaturated solution (Csol*
= 1.03) which raises the propensity for a higher rate of crystallization
within the bulk solution than Condition 2 where the solution is only
saturated (Csol* = 1.0).

Experimental tests
are performed at different time intervals that
range from 30 min to 12 h, and repeated at certain time intervals
to ensure measurement repeatability.

3.2 Membrane
The membrane is perhaps
the most essential component of a LAMEE67 because it preferentially allows the passage of water vapor between
the air and solution. The membranes used in HVAC systems are usually
polymer-based,63,81 and either porous or nonporous.81 The micrographs of the membrane that is used
in the LAMEE in this paper is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Micrographs of the membrane used in the LAMEE.
Note: The image
on the right hand side of (a) was taken with an optical microscope,
whereas the images in (b) and the left hand side of (a) were taken
with a scanning electron microscope. The optical microscopy and SEM
methods are described in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2, respectively.

Figure 4a shows
images of a membrane which consists of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
support structure and expanded PTFE surface layer. The support structure
provides a strong backing for the membrane,63 whereas the surface layer is hydrophobic and serves to prevent liquid
from permeating through the membrane. A close-up image of the membrane
surface is shown in Figure 4b, and it comprises interwoven PTFE fibers and numerous stretched
pores. The pores are the areas where moisture diffuses through the
membrane.

Two important properties of membranes used in LAMEEs
are vapor
diffusion resistance (VDR) and liquid penetration pressure (LPP).82 Membranes with low VDR are desirable because
they have a high permeability to moisture transfer. Furthermore, the
LPP of a membrane should be sufficiently high to overcome the pressure
exerted on the membrane and prevent wetting. Although the VDR of a
membrane can be reduced by increasing the pore sizes and reducing
the thickness, this could result in the reduction of the membrane
LPP.63 Thus, a membrane with an appropriate
pore size should be selected to guarantee a low VDR and high LPP.63,67 The properties of the membrane used in this paper are given in Table 2.

the LAMEE82 (Adapted from ref (69))a

a The micrographs
of the membrane
are shown in Figure 4.

After each experimental
test, the membrane is detached from the
LAMEE and preserved in a sterilized desiccator at room temperature
(∼24 °C). This is done to ensure that crystals that may
have formed within the membrane do not absorb moisture from the environment
and dissolve. The sections of a membrane that are subsequently analyzed
are those that overlay on the holes in the inner pipe of the LAMEE
where moisture transfer occurs (see Figure 3c).

3.3 Noninvasive Methods
Noninvasive methods
are used to delineate the evolution of crystallization fouling by
monitoring the performance parameters of the LAMEE. These performance
parameters are calculated from in situ experimental measurements and
are namely moisture flux and moisture-transfer resistance.

The
moisture flux, ṁv″, represents the rate of mass
of water vapor that permeates from the desiccant solution to the air
stream per unit surface area of the membrane, and is given by 1  

The moisture-transfer resistance
of the LAMEE, R, is the overall resistance to moisture
transfer between the air
and solution sides, as given by 2  

The log-mean humidity ratio, ΔWlm, is given by 3  

The change in the concentration of
the desiccant solution (before
and after a test) is negligible for all the tests conducted. Therefore, eq 3 can be simplified into 4  

3.4 Invasive Methods
In this paper, three
invasive methods are used to characterize the buildup of deposits
on a membrane surface ex situ. The three methods are optical microscopy,
SEM, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and have been
widely used to study fouling in several studies (see review papers22,55).

3.4.1 Optical Microscopy
Optical microscopy
involves the use of lenses to magnify transmitted or reflected light
from a surface and has been described as the most direct way to monitor
fouling on a membrane.22 Although optical
microscopy instruments are affordable and time-saving, they are limited
by their need for a lucid fluid medium.25 In addition, optical microscopy is typically used in ambient environments
which are not conducive for the preservation of hygroscopic crystals
that may be deposited in membranes. Notwithstanding, optical microscopy
is used in this paper as a preliminary technique to confirm the presence
of crystal particles on a fouled membrane.

A fresh membrane
and a supposedly fouled membrane are selected for imaging. The membrane
samples are removed from the desiccator, firmly taped to a microscope
slide, and examined with a Zeiss AxioPlan microscope. The image processing
program of the microscope83 is used to
improve the contrast of the images to clarify and intensify the features
on the membrane surface. A comparison of the images of fresh and fouled
membranes is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Comparison of the surface sections of (a) fresh and (b) fouled
membranes from a 30 min test at the high fouling rate (RHair = 10%, Csol* = 1.03).

Figure 5a
clearly
shows the surface layer and support structures of the fresh membrane
(see Figure 4a), whereas
crystals are clearly visible as dark particles on the fouled membrane
image in Figure 5b.
The images in Figure 5b not only confirm the formation of crystal particles on the membrane
surface but also demonstrate that there was such a rapid and severe
fouling that the crystals formed a cake structure within a 30 min
period.

3.4.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM
is a widely used surface characterization technique, which involves
the bombardment of a surface with powerful electrons and subsequent
detection/image reconstruction of the reflected or scattered electrons
with electro-magnetic lenses.22 SEM does
not require the preparation of very thin samples like in transmission
electron microscopy and can typically achieve a resolution of 1–10
nm which exceeds the limit of optical microscopy.84 However, polymer membranes need to be coated with a conductive
metal before SEM analysis to increase the conductivity of the membrane
surface and resolution of the images obtained.22,55

In this paper, SEM is used to depict the morphological changes
in the development of crystallization fouling on a membrane. Before
imaging is performed, a preserved membrane is extracted from the desiccator
and several sections of the membrane sample are dissected, mounted
on stubs, and coated with a thin film of gold using an Edwards S150B
gold sputter coater. SEM imaging is mostly done using a Phenom G2
Pure desktop scanning electron microscope with a resolution of 30
nm. However, the shapes of full-grown crystals on fouled membranes
are imaged using a Hitachi SU8010 field emission scanning electron
microscope which can achieve a resolution of 1.0–1.3 nm. SEM
analysis is performed on membrane sections that are overlaid on the
holes in the inner pipe of the LAMEE where moisture transfer occurs.
For each test performed, several sections of a membrane are analyzed
with the scanning electron microscope to assess the similarity of
the crystal deposits.

Figure 6 shows some
SEM images of different sections of fouled membranes.

Figure 6 SEM micrographs of the
surface sections of membranes after 2 h
tests at the high fouling rate (RHair = 10%, Csol* = 1.03). Note: Images from a first test at different locations
of the membrane are shown in (a,b), while those from repeated tests
are shown in (c–e).

Figure 6 shows
that
the crystals appear in the form of cake layers on the membrane surface.
In addition, it can also be observed that the cake layers are fractured.
The images from different sections of the membranes in Figure 6 confirm that the structure
of the crystal particles is consistent across various sections of
a membrane from repeated tests. Similar findings were also obtained
for repeated tests at other operating conditions and time intervals.

3.4.3 Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
EDX involves the use of a semiconductor component to analyze the
electro-magnetic energy reflected from a substance to determine the
atomic composition of the substance.55,84 EDX machines
are typically used in conjunction with scanning electron microscopes
or transmission electron microscopes55 and
are effective for identifying the elemental composition of fouling
deposits in membranes.46,55

In this paper, an Oxford
Instruments X-MaxN 50 mm2 EDX machine is used
in combination with a Hitachi SU6600 field emission scanning electron
microscope to analyze the composition of deposits on a fouled membrane
sample. The EDX method is hereby used to qualitatively identify the
composition of crystal deposits observed in the SEM images of fouled
membranes rather than to quantify the composition of the deposits.

4 Results and Discussion
In this section,
the noninvasive and invasive methods presented
in Section 3 are used
to address the objectives of this paper (i.e., to identify the evolution
of crystallization fouling in membranes and identify the composition
and structure of the fouling deposits).

4.1 Evolution
of Fouling
4.1.1 Noninvasive Methods (Moisture Flux and Moisture-Transfer
Resistance)
Figure 7 depicts the evolution of fouling in a LAMEE at two operating
conditions of low and high fouling rates, using both the moisture
flux and moisture-transfer resistance parameters.

Figure 7 Evolution of crystallization
fouling in the LAMEE using (a) moisture
flux and (b) moisture-transfer resistance parameters for tests at
the low and high fouling rates.

Figure 7a
shows
a comparison of the evolution of moisture flux through the membrane
during the tests at the low and high fouling rates. It can be seen
that there is an initial overshoot of the moisture flux at the start
of the test at the low fouling rate. Afterward, the moisture flux
continuously decays during the entire duration of both tests. Expectedly,
the moisture flux is higher for the test at the high fouling rate
compared with the test at the low fouling rate. However, the higher
rate of moisture transfer in the test at the high fouling rate resulted
in the considerable development of crystallization fouling in the
LAMEE. The crystals possibly blocked the membrane pores and formed
a layer on the membrane surface, thereby drastically impeding the
permeation of moisture through the membrane. The slight decay in moisture
flux in the test at the low fouling rate may be attributed to a minimal
buildup of deposits on the membrane surface. The moisture flux decays
and reaches quasi-steady-state conditions at ∼4 h for the test
at the low fouling rate, whereas the moisture flux begins to flatten
out at ∼11 h for the test at the high fouling rate.

Figure 7b shows
that the moisture-transfer resistances of the LAMEE at the low and
high fouling rates are at a similar magnitude at the start of the
tests. The moisture-transfer resistance for the test at the low fouling
rate rises and attains quasi-steady-state conditions early at ∼4
h. For the test at the low fouling rate, the intermittent rise and
fall in the moisture-transfer resistance can be attributed to (i)
periodic changes (∼±1%) in the relative humidity of air
supplied to the LAMEE and (ii) low driving force for moisture transfer
between the desiccant solution and air stream (see eq 3). For the test at the high fouling
rate, the moisture-transfer resistance substantially increases during
the main part of the test and approaches an asymptotic limit toward
the end of the test.

The results of the noninvasive methods
in Figure 7 confirm
that crystallization fouling in
the LAMEE reduces the moisture flux through the membrane and increases
the overall moisture-transfer resistance of the LAMEE (see Section 2.2).

4.1.2 Invasive Method (SEM)
Figure 8 shows the SEM micrographs
of membranes for tests performed at different intervals.

Figure 8 Evolution of
crystallization fouling in membranes using the SEM
method for tests performed at the (a) low and (b) high fouling rates.
Note: The time that crystals are first observed on a membrane is indicated
by a check mark that is adjacent to the corresponding membrane image.
All the images are taken at a magnification of 1000 and the scale
bars are 120 μm in length.

Figure 8 shows
SEM
micrographs that depict the evolution of crystallization fouling in
membranes. The structural changes in the crystal deposits in Figure 8 are described in
succeeding paragraphs.

In Figure 8a, crystal
particles are not observed on the membrane surface within the first
30 min. A slow development of minute crystals is first seen at 1 h
(denoted by a check symbol that is adjacent to the corresponding image);
thereafter, there is negligible change in the structure or distribution
of the particles even at 12 h. Within 1–12 h, the crystals
remain mostly small and speckled which suggests that there is a very
low rate of deposit accumulation on the membrane surface rather than
the agglomeration of large-size crystals or development of cake layers.
Thus, minimal external fouling appears to be the dominant mechanism
at the low fouling rate.

In Figure 8b, coarse
loosely-structured rock-like crystal particles are observed within
the first 30 min (denoted by a check symbol that is adjacent to the
corresponding image), possibly because of the supersaturation of the
bulk solution coupled with a high rate of moisture transfer through
the membrane. At 1 h, several crystals had agglomerated into cake
formations which can be seen on the membrane. It is interesting to
observe that at the 2nd h, the crystals form into smooth and fractured
cake layers (see Figure 6). The continuous dehydration of MgCl2(aq) likely led
to the drying of the crystals, which resulted in the fragmentation
of the cake layer within 2–12 h.

The morphological transformation
of the crystal particles on the
membrane surface is more significant at the high fouling rate (Figure 8b) than at the low
fouling rate (Figure 8a). As mentioned in Section 2.2, it is highly probable that substantial external fouling
is the governing mechanism at the high fouling rate. The SEM method
is unable to confirm if crystals are deposited within the pores of
fouled membranes (i.e., internal fouling) because the electron beam
of the scanning electron microscope physically melts the PTFE fibers
of the membrane when the imaging magnification is significantly increased.
However, the SEM method is able to establish the presence of external
fouling for the tests at both low and high fouling rates.

The
results in Figures 7 and 8 strongly suggest that during
the dehydration of desiccant solutions in LAMEEs, a high moisture
flux increases the amount of crystals that amass on membranes. In
addition, a high rate of moisture transfer through membranes can lead
to considerable changes in the morphology of the crystal deposits.

4.2 Characterization of Fouling Deposits (SEM,
EDX)
The elemental composition of deposit formations on fouled
membranes is analyzed to confirm that the deposits are made up of
MgCl2·6H2O crystals. The fouling deposits
are first assessed with SEM to visualize the shape of a fully grown
crystal on a layer of agglomerated deposits (Figure 9), and the composition of the deposits is
identified using SEM–EDX (Figure 10).

Figure 9 SEM micrograph of a crystal on a membrane after
a 12 h test at
the high fouling rate (RHair = 10%, Csol*
= 1.03).

Figure 10 (a) SEM micrograph and (b) corresponding
EDX map profile of a membrane
after a 12 h test at the high fouling rate (RHair = 10%, Csol* = 1.03). Note: The map profile in (b) corresponds
to the area of the micrograph in (a). Note: cps = counts per second;
eV = electron volts.

Figure 9 clearly
depicts the octahedral shape of a MgCl2·6H2O crystal, which is consistent with what is reported in the literature.85 On the other hand, Figure 10 depicts a section of a fouled membrane
that completely overlays a perforated hole in the inner pipe (tube)
of the LAMEE (see Figure 3c). The SEM image in Figure 10a shows a cake layer on the membrane, whereas the EDX
plot in Figure 10b
shows the elemental constituents of the cake layer. Expectedly, the
highest peaks in Figure 10b correspond to Mg and Cl elements from MgCl2.
The O element in H2O is detected but H is not detected
because EDX is incapable of detecting hydrogen.86,87 The presence of Au is detected because of the sputter coating of
the membrane surface with gold. A low peak of C exists most likely
because the membrane surface layer is made of C, whereas the low peaks
of Ca may be attributed to the presence of trace quantities of CaCO3 in H2O(aq).

4.3 Comparison
of Methods
A comparison
of the noninvasive and invasive methods that are used to address the
objectives of this paper is presented in Table 3.

It can be seen from Table 3 that the main strength of the
noninvasive methods is in their
real-world applicability to detect and monitor fouling in operating
exchangers, whereas the invasive methods are better suited to characterize
fouling deposits. In addition, a comparison of the operational features
of the noninvasive and invasive methods indicates that the noninvasive
methods have an almost unlimited sampling rate but with a greater
demand for data processing, whereas there is a practical limitation
in the sampling rate of the invasive methods. Sampling rate refers
to the frequency in which data can be collected and analyzed to study
fouling.

5 Conclusion
The main
aim of this paper is to characterize the evolution of
crystallization fouling in membranes through the application of noninvasive
and invasive methods. Membranes are fouled during 12 h tests in which
MgCl2(aq) is dehydrated in a LAMEE at two operating conditions
of low and high fouling rates. The noninvasive methods consist of two parameters (moisture flux and moisture-transfer
resistance) that are used to monitor the development of fouling in
a LAMEE. The invasive methods consist of optical microscopy and SEM
which are used to visualize the morphology of crystal deposits, and
EDX which is used to identify the composition of the deposits.

The major findings from the paper are outlined as follows:1. Crystallization
fouling decreases the
moisture flux through the membrane and increases the moisture-transfer
resistance of the LAMEE more significantly in the test at the high
fouling rate than in the test at the low fouling rate.

2. SEM micrographs show that cake crystal
deposits are observed on membrane surfaces at the high fouling rate,
whereas only few crystal particles are deposited on membranes at the
low fouling rate.

3. The
crystal deposits undergo greater
structural transformations in tests performed at the high fouling
rate compared with tests performed at the low fouling rate. The high
rate of moisture transfer through the membrane is the likely reason
for the substantial changes observed in crystal deposits at the high
fouling rate.

4. The SEM
micrograph of a crystal deposit
on a membrane confirms the octahedral shape of MgCl2·6H2O.

5. EDX analysis
indicates that the crystal
deposits compose of mainly Mg, Cl, and O elements.
