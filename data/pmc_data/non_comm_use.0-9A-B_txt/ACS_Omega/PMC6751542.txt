The research for
gas–liquid two-phase flow is very important
for flow assurance and flow stability of chemical transportation.
In terms of transportation pipelines, the curved section is a very
significant part. Therefore, the present work proposes a transient
slug flow model for the curve pipes, and we conducted some experiments
to validate it. This slug flow model is a four-equation model that
contains mass and momentum balances with the closure relations. The
normal two-dimensional rectangular coordinate system is simplified
to the one-dimensional polar coordinate system, which will make the
simulation faster and easier. The common flow parameters, such as
the pressure profile along the pipeline, real-time pressure, and liquid
holdup, are calculated in this model. Three groups of experiments
with three different pipe curvatures were carried out to validate
this model; the experiments were under the same conditions as those
of the model calculations. The transient pressure and liquid holdup
were measured at the middle of the curved pipe. The experimental data
are compared to the calculated results, and there are error analyses
of pressure and liquid holdup that are made to review the model’s
performance. The analyses show that a large proportion of the pressure
errors is within 10%, and most of the liquid holdup errors are within
0.1. The comparisons between the model and experiments show good agreement.

1 Introduction
The gas–liquid two-phase flow occurs in the nuclear reactors,
oil and gas transportation pipelines,1,2 chemical transportation
pipelines, and heat exchangers. In the oil and chemical engineering
field, the study of the gas–liquid two-phase flow is mainly
on transportation of different chemical fluids. Almost all transportation
pipelines have a curved section due to the complex structure of different
terrains, which will cause some flow pattern changes in contrast with
straight sections. Various two-phase flow patterns exist in the pipe,
and the most unsteady one is the slug flow, which has influence on
the efficiency of transportation and reduces the service life of pipes.
In this flow pattern, the liquid phase exists intermittently in the
form of a liquid slug and liquid film along the pipe, and the gas
phase exists as an elongated bubble and tiny bubbles along the pipe.
This complicated flow pattern could appear in all the horizontal,
inclined, and curved pipelines, and it could cause fluctuations of
liquid holdup and pressure. Therefore, the accurate prediction of
the slug flow characteristics of the curved section is of great significance
in chemical transportation.

The development of the gas–liquid
two-phase flow has been
an important research for many years. In the earlier periods, studies
of two-phase flow in the vertical pipe were concentrated on the partition
of different flow patterns by experiments, and then researchers obtained
several steady-state models about pressure, density, and liquid holdup
along the pipe.3−8 Later on, some researchers proposed different flow patterns, new
flow pattern transition criteria, and new steady-state models to predict
liquid holdup and pressure drop, and they conducted experiments to
validate these models.9−15

As the number of requirements for the study on dynamic changes
of slug flow increases, transient models were developed for its two
different types, which are the slug tracking model and two-fluid model.

Barnea and Taitel16 came up with a slug
tracking model to simulate the movement of the bubbles by replacing
the unit cell with the bubble translational velocity. Then, Zheng
et al.17 added the liquid mass balance
on the kinematic model created by Barnea and Taitel;16 their model can describe all the simplified slug characteristics
of a slug unit in a hilly pipe. Nydal and Banerjee18 came up with a Lagrangian slug tracking model. There are
mass and momentum balances on each slug and bubble unit in their model,
which can calculate the pressure and the slug velocities. However,
the aeration of the slug was ignored in this model. Taitel and Barnea19 modified the slug tracking model. In their model,
the momentum equations assumed a local equilibrium force balance for
each cell. It can predict the slug growth and decay under transient
conditions. Ujang et al.20 obtained a new
slug tracking model by applying the liquid slug and the elongated
bubble as different objects, and a quasi-steady momentum equation
was used to obtain the pressure in the model. The distribution of
slug length at the inlet is highly sensitive in their model. Franca
et al.21 developed a model that can estimate
the convection heat transfer in a horizontal slug flow. The average
convective heat transfer is calculated based on the unit cell model.
Kjeldby et al.22 proposed a slug tracking
model that is called a slug capturing technique. Their model is mainly
used in capturing the slug in horizontal and nearly horizontal pipes,
which can present the properties of hydrodynamic slugs in the pipes.
However, it is not applied to vertical flows. Medina et al.23 coupled heat transfer-governing equations to
the slug tracking model with energy balance in developed, nonboiling
horizontal two-phase slug flows.

The two-fluid model was first
established by Ishii et al.,24 and then,
it was incorporated in several industrial
codes such as the OLGA model. This OLGA model was developed by Bendiksen
et al.,25 and it can simulate transient
pressure in a two-phase slug flow. Based on the two-fluid model, De
Henau26 proposed a new method for the drag
coefficient and the virtual mass force of the slug flow. What is more,
simulations and experimental results were compared in three slug flow
cases of horizontal pipes and inclined pipes. Lima and Yeung27 offered a two-fluid model to get the volumetric
liquid holdup, pressure, and velocities of the gas and liquid phases.
Issa and Kempf28 proposed the one-dimensional
transient two-fluid model that can capture slug initiation. They made
numerical simulations at the unsteady stratified flow in which instabilities
could grow to form slugs. The numerical results showed that the slug
flow can be simulated by their model, and continuous slugs can be
generated automatically. Chang and Liou29 introduced additional dissipation terms into the numerical flux.
This scheme, called AUSM +-up, can be applied to the liquid flow and
gas flow. Danielson et al.30 came up with
a transient three-phase 1D simulator that was developed for capturing
transient slug flow. It is a multifluid model consisting of mass,
momentum, and energy-conservative equations. Fullmer et al.31 found that the two-fluid model with their interfacial
pressure model is unconditionally stable. Recently, Panicker et al.32 proposed a closure relation based on the research
of Biesheuvel and Gorissen.33 This closure
relation has a dispersion coefficient determined to ensure the hyperbolic
attribute of the two-fluid model, which makes the convergence of the
two-fluid model to be well achieved without adding another pressure
term.

However, all these models were concentrated on the horizontal,
vertical, and inclined situations, and only few research studies focused
on the slug flow in the curved pipe, which almost exists in all transportation
pipelines as shown in Figure 1. In the present work, a slug flow model is proposed for the
curved sections, which can be applied to chemical transportation.
It can predict the real-time pressure profile, transient pressure,
and liquid holdup of the slug flow. The model is formed by mass and
momentum equations for each phase with closure relations. A polar
coordinate system is used instead of a rectangular coordinate system
to simplify the model to a 1D geometry. Three groups of curved-pipe
slug flow experiments were carried out in the Key Laboratory of Petroleum
Engineering of China University of Petroleum-Beijing. Then, the calculation
results are compared with experimental data in order to validate the
model.

2 Computational Methods
The governing equations are for an isothermal transient slug flow;
thus, the heat transfer between the liquid and gas has been ignored.
Only four equations are required without energy balances, which are
the mass and momentum balances of the gas phase and liquid phase.
The gas mass balance equation is 1  

The gas momentum balance equation
is 2  

The liquid mass balance equation is 3  

The liquid momentum balance
equation is 4  

The last term on the right
side of eq 4 indicates
the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid.

The slug model of the
curved pipe is two-dimensional in a rectangular
coordinate system. In order to make it easier to solve, it can be
simplified to a one-dimensional model. The rectangular coordinate
system is converted to a polar coordinate system by using the trait
of the curve. The relations between the two coordinate systems are 5   6  

Therefore,
the one-dimensional governing equations are written
as follows:Gas mass balance: 7   8  

Gas momentum
balance: 9  

Liquid mass balance: 10  

Liquid momentum balance: 11

volume balance in two-phase flow models: 12

2.1.1 Shear
Stress
As calculated by Issa
and Kempf,28 the Taitel and Dukler34 and Spedding and Hand35 relations are more accurate in inclined pipes, and the Wallis36 relation is more accurate in vertical pipes.
In the present study, the curved pipe is divided into several segments
by the angle θ, which are similar to the inclined segments,
so the Taitel and Dukler34 relation is
adopted. The liquid–wall, gas–wall, and gas–liquid
interfacial shear stresses are 13  

2.1.2 Friction Factor
The relations of
friction factor f are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, the Reynolds numbers of the gas, liquid, and interface
are defined as 14

As this work mainly focuses on the slug flow, the CD for the turbulent flow is used in the model. Re2φ is defined as 21  In this equation, rb and μm are the radius of
bubble and the viscosity of mixture: 22  

3 Numerical
Solution
The governing equations can be written in the matrix
form: 23   24  where the vector ϕ
is given as 25  

The matrices of A, B, B′, and C are written respectively
as 26   27   28  

3.1 Discretization
The partial differential
equations can be solved by several numerical methods. The present
study adopts a finite difference method, which is widely used in different
situations, and it is easier and faster than other methods. Discretizing eqs 1–6 with an implicit first-order scheme, the discretizations
are written as the following:Gas mass balance discretization: 29  

Gas
momentum balance discretization: 30  

Liquid mass balance discretization: 31  

Liquid
momentum balance discretization: 32  



The discretizations use a first-order upwind scheme
in space and use an implicit first-order scheme in time. The solution
procedure of eqs 29–32 can be summarized as the following steps:Step 1. Obtain the data of the initial
conditions.

Step 2. The gas–wall,
liquid–wall, and
gas–liquid interfacial shear stresses, friction factors, and
the drag force are calculated.

Step 3.
Every element of the coefficients’ matrix
and every independent vector are calculated using the initial conditions
given in Table 2.

Step 4. Calculations are repeated from cell i = 2 to cell i = n; use
the variables calculated in cell i = 2 as the input
variables to cell i = 3 and so on until the input
variables for cell i = n are calculated.

Step 5. When the variables are calculated
in all the
cells, a new time t + dt is assigned
to t, and the calculation is repeated from step 3
until the entire simulation is finished.

4.1 Experiment Arrangement
Air and water
are used as flow media in the experiments. The experimental system
includes a horizontal pipe connected to a curved pipe at its downstream,
and the outlet of the pipeline is connected to the air as shown in Figure 5. Measurements were
taken at a nominal temperature of 20 °C. These pipes are made
of transparent acrylic resin where the flow patterns can be observed
easily. The inner diameter of the pipes is 50 mm. The length of the
straight pipe is 1 m, and the curvature of the pipe can be changed
by replacing the curved pipe (the curvature r = 1,
1.5, and 2 m). As shown in Figure 4, there is a pressure measuring point in the middle
of the pipe.

Figure 4 Curved pipe of the experiment loop (the photo was taken
by S.S.).

The water is injected by a screw
pump from the water tank to the
mixer, which mixes water with air supplied from the gas tank. There
are several flow meters installed on the pipeline, including a turbine
flow meter for the water and a volume flow meter for the gas; the
experiments use electromagnetic valves to control the gas flow rate
within the range of 15–1000 L/min and liquid flow rate within
the range of 0.1–1 m3/h. The mixture flows through
the curved section and is discharged into a tank to separate the gas
from the liquid. The maximum uncertainties of liquid and gas flow
rate measurements are 2%.

4.2 Experimental Parameter
Measurement
As shown in Figure 5, three Rosemount
pressure gauges with a
measurement range of 0–500 kPa are installed on the experimental
loop; the three gauges are placed at the entrance of the curved pipe,
the middle of the curved pipe, and the outlet of the curved pipe.
The turbine flow meter for the water has a measurement range of 0.1–1.5
m3/h, and the gas volume flow meter has a measurement range
of 10–2000 L/min. A conductivity measurement device for liquid
holdup, proposed by Fossa,38 is installed
at the outlet of the curved pipe. The device can detect the liquid
holdup changes as the mixture flows through the curved pipe. Contrasted
with other approaches, this method is rather simple and can measure
the liquid holdup in real time without breaking the flow pattern.
This device is shown in Figure 6. Experimental initial and boundary conditions are listed
in Table 2, which are
also used in the numerical scheme.

two-phase slug
flow experiment loop.

unit (the photos were taken by S.S.).

4.3 Experimental Procedure
First, we
started the air compressor to inject air into the gas tank until it
reached a stable pressure state. Then, we injected water into the
pipe at the rate of 0.2 m/s. When the curved pipe was full of water,
we injected the gas into the mixer from the gas tank at the rate of
4 m/s. We recorded the pressures and liquid holdup for several seconds
and the flow pattern in the curved pipe. Then, we replaced the curved
pipe with different curvatures and repeated the above steps.

5 Results and Discussion
The slug model of the curved
pipe is also simulated for three groups.
We changed the curvature, and kept the other conditions the same.
Then, the results are compared with experimental results to validate
the model.

First, initial and boundary conditions for the numerical
simulations
are given the same as the experimental conditions, which are summarized
in Table 2. The pipeline
is divided into a grid of 1000 cells with the same angle θ.
The time step size is calculated by the number of CFL, which is an
important part for the transient simulation and is defined as 33  where the Δt and Δθ are the time step size and grid size
(Figure 3), respectively.
The constant value C is set to 0.5.

5.1 Transient
Pressure Profiles
Figures 7–9 are numerical results of transient
pressure profiles of cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These three
graphs show the pressure profiles along the pipeline as time elapses
(t = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 1.5 s are chosen
to be presented in the graphs), and the scattered points are experimental
data. It can be seen that the pressure curve has a descending middle
part, which basically corresponds to the curved pipe structure. In Figure 7, the maximum error
between the model and experimental data is 18.6%, and the average
error is 12.2%. In Figure 8, the maximum error between the model and experimental data
is 13.7%, and the average error is 9.8%. In Figure 9, the maximum error between the model and
experimental data is 19.9%, and the average error is 13.8%. It can
be inferred that all the errors between model calculations and experimental
data are in the range of 20%, which is relatively acceptable. The
simulation pipeline is full of the gas–liquid mixture at approximately
1.0, 1.1, and 1.25 s for cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Figure 9 indicates that a
larger pipe curvature has a higher pressure value. Because the air
is introduced in the pipe gradually, pressure oscillations grow along
the pipeline, and the pressure profile curve rapidly becomes the typical
shape of a slug flow wave like the phenomenon of a slug flow observed
in experiments (as shown in Figure 10 with pipe curvatures of 1 and 2 m).

by S.S.).

5.2 Transient
Pressure and Error Analysis
The pressures of model prediction
and experiments against time with
a pipe curvature of 1 m (case 1) are plotted in Figure 11. The maximum values of experimental
data and predicted data at the measuring point are 19.38 and 19.10
kPa, respectively; the minimum values of experimental data and predicted
data are 12.50 and 13.84 kPa, respectively. The liquid superficial
velocity (0.2 m/s) and gas superficial velocity (4 m/s) are used as
initial values of the model calculation, which are also used in the
experiment. As can be seen from Figure 11, the experimental pressure curve (orange
line) shows many tiny fluctuations because of the tiny gas bubbles
in the slug and the vortex motion by the liquid film. The simulation
of pressure (blue line) is performed relatively well from 2 to 4 s;
from 0 to 2 s, the predicted curve is averagely ahead of the experimental
curve, and after 4 s, the predicted curve lags behind the experimental
curve. Figure 12 shows
the error analysis of pressure data, and in order to make the error
analysis more visual, only the peak and trough values of the experimental
data points are compared with those of the predicted model curve.
The horizontal error bar is set to a fixed value of 0.1 s, and the
vertical error bar is set to 10%. It can be seen that three vertical
errors are larger than 10%; the maximum vertical error is 13.1%, and
the average pressure error between predication and experiments is
7.03%. Eight horizontal errors are larger than 0.1 s; the maximum
horizontal error is 0.16 s, and the average horizontal error is 0.08
s. In general, the model curve of case 1 is fitted well to the experimental
results.

data for pressure of case 1.

Figure 12 Pressure
error analysis of the curve model of case 1.

Figure 13 shows
the pressure curves of experimental data and predicted values of the
model with the pipe curvature of 1.5 m (case 2). The maximum values
of experimental pressure data and predicted data at the measuring
point are 22.57 and 22.53 kPa, respectively; the minimum values of
experimental data and predicted data at the measuring point are 13.23
and 14.15 kPa, respectively. From 2.6 to 6 s, the predicted curve
has an obvious time deviation compared to the experimental curve,
and the rest of the parts of the predicted curve perform relatively
well. With regard to error analysis, it can be seen in Figure 14 that all vertical errors
except four points are controlled within a margin of 10%; the maximum
vertical error is 14.15%, and the average pressure error between the
prediction and experiments is 7.74%. Horizontally, the maximum horizontal
error is 0.14 s, and the average horizontal error is 0.07 s. Therefore,
the model of case 2 is well fitted.

of pressure and the experimental
data for pressure of case 2.

error analysis of the curve model of case 2.

Figure 15 shows
the pressure curves of experimental data and predicted values of the
model with the pipe curvature of 2 m (case 3). The maximum values
of experimental pressure data and predicted data at the measuring
point are 26.33 and 25.51 kPa, respectively; the minimum values of
experimental data and predicted data at the measuring point are 18.98
and 19.71 kPa, respectively. There are only two points that have obvious
time deviations, and the rest of the parts of the predicted curve
perform relatively well. With regard to error analysis, it can be
seen in Figure 16 that
all vertical errors are controlled within a margin of 10%; the maximum
vertical error is 6.84%, and the average vertical error between predication
and experiments is 3.02%. Horizontally, the maximum horizontal error
is 0.14 s, and the average horizontal error is 0.06 s. It shows that
the model of case 3 is fitted very well.

numerical results of pressure and the experimental
data for pressure of case 3.

error analysis of the curve model of case 3.

5.3 Transient Liquid Holdup and Error Analysis
The liquid holdups against time are plotted in Figure 17. In this figure, the predicted
liquid holdup curve is compared to the experimental liquid holdup
curve (case 1). The maximum values of experimental data and predicted
data are 0.78 and 0.735, respectively; the minimum values of experimental
data and predicted data are 0.09 and 0.13, respectively. It is shown
that the liquid holdup curve of this model has severe oscillations,
which indicate different slugs flow through the pipe corresponding
to the phenomenon of a slug flow through the pipe as shown in Figure 10. It also can be
seen in Figure 17 that
the predicted liquid holdup values are fitted well to experimental
data, but some predicted liquid holdup oscillations have time deviations
from the experimental curve. Figure 18 is the error analysis of the liquid holdup of case
1, which is just like the pressure error analysis, and only values
of the peak points and trough points are selected. The horizontal
error bar is set to a fixed value of 0.1 s, and the vertical error
bar is set to a fixed value of 0.1. It is found that all the vertical
errors are controlled within the margin of 0.1; the maximum vertical
error is 0.09, and the average vertical error is 0.04. Most of the
horizontal errors are controlled within the margin of 0.1 s except
for five points; the maximum horizontal error is 0.25 s, and the average
horizontal error is 0.08 s. As a result, the error analysis is fairly
ideal. However, there are many irregular liquid holdup fluctuations
caused by the unstable churn flow at the slug tail and slug head that
can be seen on the experimental curve; therefore, the simulated result
cannot entirely reflect these irregular fluctuations in the present
study.

Figure 17 Comparison of the numerical results of liquid holdup and the experimental
data of liquid holdup of case 1.

Figure 18 Liquid
holdup error of the curve model of case 1.

Figure 19 shows
the comparison of liquid holdup curves between the experiments and
model predictions (case 2). The maximum values of the experiment and
prediction are 0.86 and 0.75, respectively; the minimum values of
the experiment and prediction are 0.12 and 0.11, respectively. In
case 2, oscillations of the liquid holdup curve are more severe than
those of case 1. However, the time deviations of case 2 are less than
those of case 1. Figure 20 shows the error analysis of liquid holdup of case 2. In terms
of the vertical errors, there is one point that exceeds the margin
of 0.1; the maximum liquid holdup error is 0.11, and the average liquid
holdup error is 0.05. When it comes to the horizontal errors, there
are five horizontal errors that are larger than 0.1 s; the maximum
horizontal error is 0.14 s, and the average horizontal error is 0.07
s. Overall, the errors are acceptable, and the predicted curve is
well matched to the experimental curve.

results of liquid holdup and the experimental
data of liquid holdup of case 2.

holdup error of the curve model of case 2.

In Figure 21, the
comparison between the model liquid holdup curve and experimental
liquid holdup curve of case 3 is shown. The maximum values of the
experiment and prediction are 0.90 and 0.75, respectively; the minimum
values of experiment and prediction are 0.10 and 0.12, respectively. Figure 22 shows the error
analysis of liquid holdup of case 3. In terms of the vertical errors,
there are two points that exceed the margin of 0.1; the maximum vertical
error is 0.16, and the average vertical error is 0.05. With regard
to the horizontal errors, there are three horizontal errors that are
larger than 0.1 s; the maximum horizontal error is 0.11 s, and the
average horizontal error is 0.05 s. In general, the predicted curve
is well matched to the experimental curve.

6 Conclusions
A transient slug flow model for
curved sections is proposed in
this study, which can closely reflect the characteristics of the slug
flow in a curved pipe. The simulation results are compared with experimental
results under same conditions. One of the main points of the model
is that the two-dimensional rectangular coordinate system is simplified
to a one-dimensional polar coordinate system of a curved section,
which saves time vastly and makes the simulations more convenient.

Three groups of slug flow experiments with different pipe curvatures
were conducted in the Key Laboratory of Petroleum Engineering of China
University of Petroleum-Beijing. The slug flow in the curved pipe
was observed in the visualized experiments. Subsequently, pressures
were measured at different locations of the curved pipe, and the liquid
holdup at the outlet of the curved pipe was also measured.

The
transient pressure profiles along the pipe can well reflect
the slug propagations in the pipeline at different times, which was
observed in the experiments. The pipe is full of the gas–liquid
mixture at approximately 1.0, 1.1, and 1.25 s for cases 1, 2, and
3, respectively. When comparing the experimental pressure data with
the calculated pressure profile, the average errors are 12.2, 9.8,
and 13.8%, respectively. The real-time pressure and liquid holdup,
the most common standards in a multiphase flow field, are calculated
to be compared with the experimental results. The comparison results
and error analyses of cases 1, 2, and 3 show that the model calculations
are well fitted to experimental results in general.

This work
could provide good guidance for predicting the characteristics
of the slug flow in the curved pipelines, which are important for
the improvement of flow stability.
