The assembly of noble-metal core–satellite (CS) nanostructures
is an appealing means to control their plasmonic properties for their
applications such as surface-enhanced fluorescence or Raman scattering.
However, till now there is a lack of some rapid or convenient methods
to construct stable CS nanostructures. Here, we proposed a “clicked-to-assembly”
strategy based on the fast and specific “click chemistry”
reaction between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (Tz).
The CS nanostructures were constructed within 8 min by simple mixing
of TCO- or Tz-modified nanoparticles (TCO-NPs or Tz-NPs) without any
catalysts or heating required. Transmission electron microscopy experiments
show that the constructed CS nanostructures are uniform, and particularly
the number of “satellite” nanoparticles in the core
surface is controllable by simply adjusting the feeding ratio of TCO-NPs
or Tz-NPs in the reaction. The strong surface plasmon coupling effect
(SPCE) was observed in these CS nanostructures, which was dependent
on the coverage degree, size and composition of the satellite, and
core NPs. The nanostructures with tuned surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) effect were tried for the surface-enhanced fluorescence in living
cells. Such well-defined CS nanostructures could potentially serve
as efficient SPR-enhanced fluorescent probes as diagnostics or biomedical
imaging agents in nanomedicine.

Introduction
Plasmonic core–satellite (CS) nanostructure constructed
with subwavelength noble-metal nanoparticles has been attracting great
interest due to their unique optoelectronic characteristics.1 The CS nanostructure may induce strong localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) different to individual nanoparticles
originating from the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons
between core and satellite nanoparticles.2 The LSPR properties have stimulated such a rapid advance in CS nanostructure
and its applications in such as resonant plasmonic-enhanced optical
signal.3

The enhancement of optical signal highly depends on the resonant
plasmonic effect from individual nanoparticles (NPs) or their assemblies,
which is influenced by size, shape, materials of particles, etc.4 Meanwhile, it is observed that their enhanced
fluorescence effect decreases sharply when their SPR wavelength moves
away from the excitation wavelength of the fluorophore or when the
SPR has only a partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the fluorophore.4b Herein, the regulation of its SPR wavelength
of nanoparticles or their assemblies is essential for resonant plasmonic
enhancement.5

To tune the SPR in a wide range of wavelengths, various methods
including top-down and bottom-up methods have been developed to construct
these nanoassemblies or nanostructures. The top-down method uses lithography
to build a special nanostructure on a substrate. Generally, it is
expensive and difficult for scale production.6 Now, the bottom-up approaches are the predominant strategy to construct
these CS nanostructures.7 In these approaches,
the surface of the core or satellite nanoparticles is modified with
certain molecules. Then CS nanostructures are self-assembled utilizing
the electrostatic interaction, van der Waals force, affinity reaction
between these molecules, etc. The used molecules include DNA,5c,8 proteins,9 polymers,10 small molecules,2,11 ions,12 etc. Despite the success, rapid, convenient, or controllable
methods are still expected with a shorter reaction time or more mild
reaction conditions.

Recently, click chemical reactions have demonstrated their importance
in material assembly as linking tools.13 In the CS nano-assemblies, Gandra and Singamaneni used a Huisgen
1, 3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azide and alkyne to assemble
gold CS nanostructures.14 The assembly
rate was relatively slow although catalyst was used in the reaction.
On comparison, the cycloaddition reaction between trans-cyclooctene
(TCO) and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (Tz) is more highly efficient.15 Here, based on the click reaction between TCO
and Tz, we developed a clicked-to-assembly method to construct stable
and controllable CS nanostructures using noble-metal nanoparticles.
The assembly can be completed within 8 min. The different CS nanostructures
with various ratios of satellite to core NPs were constructed by simply
adjusting their feeding ratio. The assembled nanostructures are uniform,
stable, and show high tolerance to salt similar to the TCO-NPs or
Tz-NPs, which demonstrates their potential applications in biological
system. The surface plasmon coupling effect (SPCE) between satellites
and core NPs was investigated in detail. It was observed that SPCE
was depended on the number of satellites (i.e., surface coverage)
and the size and composition of the building nanoparticles. As model,
the constructed CS nanostructures were applied for the surface-enhanced
fluorescence of fluorophores in the membrane of living cells.

Results and Discussion
The overall approach to assemble the CS nanostructures is shown
in Scheme 1. Gold nanoparticles
with TCO and Tz (TCO-GNPs or Tz-GNPs) were prepared by modifying GNPs
with PEG-TCO or PEG-Tz via the Au–S bond, respectively. PEG-TCO
and PEG-Tz was prepared by the fast reaction between the NHS ester
of PEG and the amine of TCO or Tz. The PEG was used as a bridge molecule
to modify GNPs, which may improve the chemical stability of GNPs in
the buffer containing high concentration of NaCl. Then, the CS nanostructures
with different number ratio of satellite to core NPs (S/C ratio) were
assembled via direct mixing and fast reaction at room temperature
(RT) by controlling the relative feeding ratio of two GNPs (Scheme 1a). Then these CS
nanostructures were used for surface-enhanced fluorescence experiments
of fluorophore in the cell membrane (Scheme 1b).

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagram of “Clicked-to-Assembly” Strategy
of Core–Satellite Nanostructures Based on the Click Reaction
between TCO and Tz (a) and Their Fluorescence Enhancement on the Fluorophores
in the Cell Membrane (b)
To understand the assembly strategy of CS nanostructures, two GNPs
with different diameters (70 and 30 nm) were prepared as core or satellite
NPs, respectively. The synthesis procedures of different sizes GNPs
are described in the Supporting Information. Their Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) photographs are shown
in Figure 1A,1B. Their average diameters are 69.3 ± 6.2 and
32.0 ± 3.1 nm, respectively. The visible absorption spectra of
Tz-GNPs and TCO-GNPs are shown in Figure S3. The minor absorption peak shifts observed indicate their good monodispersion
in the buffer after the modification and purification steps. Also,
these GNPs have their SPR maximum peak at 543 and 525 nm, which are
typical for their sizes.16 Meanwhile, to
finely control the feeding ratio of core and satellite GNPs in the
assembly step, the particle’s mole concentration of their concentrated
samples were measured with resonance light scattering correlation
spectroscopy (RLSCS) method. Its working principle is based on the
fact that the amplitude of correlation curve is equal to the reciprocal
of the particle number in the detection volume.17Figure 1E,F is the typical single-particle RLSCS (upper) and intensity trace
(lower) curves of TCO-GNPs and Tz-GNPs, respectively. Meanwhile, their
uniform scattering intensity traces also indicated that no NP aggregates
exist in the prepared GNP solutions.

(C and D) characterized with TEM. Single-particle resonance light
scattering correlation spectroscopy (RLSCS) of TCO-GNPs (E) and Tz-GNPs
(F).

The prepared TCO- or Tz-GNPs showed good stability. Figure S4 shows the change of visible absorption
spectra of TCO- or Tz-GNPs within days. It demonstrates that the SPR
peaks keep constant within one week. Figure S5 shows the change of the visible absorption spectra of TCO- or Tz-GNPs
in different concentrations of NaCl solution (from 0 to 1 M). Both
GNPs demonstrate a high resistance to salt, which is related with
the choosing of PEG as a linker. The good monodispersity and stability
of TCO- or Tz-GNPs can help to construct the “perfect”
CS nanostructure and for its bioapplications as nanoprobes.

Different CS nanostructures (Figure 2) were assembled with the click reaction between TCO
and Tz. Figure 2A(i–vi)
shows typical TEM micrographs of CS nanostructures prepared with different
satellite to core (S/C) feeding ratios from 1 to 8. The concentration
of Tz-GNPs as core NPs was fixed, but the mole concentration of TCO-GNPs
as satellite NPs changed. TEM results demonstrated that CS nanostructures
with different number of satellite NPs in the surface can be prepared.
Also, when the S/C feeding ratio is close to 8, the surface of core
NPs was completely covered with satellite NPs like a sunflower. Figure 2B shows the excellent
linear relationship between the numbers of satellite NPs in the core
surface with the S/C feeding ratio, which were extracted from no less
than 200 core–satellite nanostructures for different ratios.
The linear slope is close to 1. It suggests that two NPs reacted together
with high efficiency according to their relative concentration within
the S–C ratio range of 1 and 8. It should be related with the
high efficiency of the click reaction between TCO and Tz. This reported
reaction rate constant is far larger than those of other bioorthogonal
reactions without requiring a catalyst.15

Figure 2 CS nanostructures assembled with different feeding ratios of satellite
to core GNPs characterized with TEM (A) and the determined linear
relation between satellite number and feeding ratio (B). UV–vis
absorption spectra (C) and gel electrophoresis of different CS nanostructures
(D). The feeding ratios are 1.3 (i), 2.6 (ii), 4.1 (iii), 5.2 (iv),
6.2 (v), and 7.8 (vi), respectively.

Besides, the gel electrophoresis experiments of these CS nanostructures
also proved their uniformity and controllability. As shown in Figure 2D, CS nanostructure
with the least satellite GNPs bound (channel i) showed the fastest
mobility rate. When the number of satellite NPs increased, the electrophoretic
mobility gradually decreased, which should be attributed to the influence
of the increased sizes of CS nanostructures on mobility rates. It
also proved that these CS nanostructures had good stability and robustness
under harsh electrophoretic conditions. Meanwhile, the clear but color
change of the CS nanostructures with the S/C feeding ratio was observed
as shown in Figure S6. Also, no obvious
red shift was observed in the absorption peak when the NaCl concentration
was increased (Figure S7). These results
indicated that the chemically assembled CS nanostructures were stable
and did not agglomerate even in these NaCl solutions.

The assembling dynamics of CS nanostructures was investigated by
recording the change of SPR wavelength with time as shown in Figure 3A. The SPR maximum
absorption peaks were 572, 579, 585, and 589 nm with the reaction
time interval of 2 min, respectively. It is revealed in Figure 3B that the SPR maximum absorption
peak of the mixture reached the max value of 589 nm at 8 min and reached
an equilibrium, indicating that the assembly was completed within
8 min. This result suggests that the clicked-to-assembly strategy
based on the click reaction between TCO and Tz is far more efficient
than the reported assembly procedure based on azide-alkyne Huisgen
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction.14 The
simple but highly efficient assembly strategy is useful for the further
applications of CS nanostructures in nanophotonics.

Surface Plasmon Coupling Effect
The influence of the
number of satellites (i.e., surface coverage), size, and composition
of the building blocks on strong SPCE was investigated. It was observed
that the number of satellites greatly affects the SPCE in the CS nanostructures.
The red and black lines are the absorption spectrum of core Tz-GNPs
and satellite TCO-GNPs, and their maximum SPR is at 541 or 523 nm,
respectively. Figure 2C demonstrates that the SPR shifts to the red with the increased
S/C feeding ratio. Also, the red shift of SPR shows the linear dependence
on the satellite number per core NPs (Figure S8). These results were consistent with the simulations reported by
Ross and co-workers and the experiments by Yoon and co-workers.18

The influence of satellite size on the
SPCE was also investigated. As shown in Figure 4, the clicked-to-assembly strategy was extended
to the construct CS nanostructures with the same size of core NPs
but with different sizes of satellite NPs. The S/C feeding ratio was
adjusted to make the entire core NPs completely covered with satellite
NPs. For 30, 20, and 5 nm satellite NPs, the SPR peaks of the constructed
CS nanostructures are 589, 556, and 546 nm, respectively. The SPR
peaks red-shifted to long wavelength with the increased size of satellite
NPs due to the SPCE effect. It indicates that the size of satellite
NPs remarkably influences the SPR coupling effect between nanoparticles.

Figure 4 Surface plasmon coupling effect between Au–Au (A, B) and
Au–Ag CS nanostructures (C, D). The effect was influenced by
sizes or composites of core or satellite NPs. The sizes of GNPs as
satellite are 20 nm (A) and 5 nm (B) when using about 70 nm GNPs as
core. Accordingly, the size of AgNPs as satellite is about 15 nm when
using 70 nm (C) and 50 nm (D) GNPs as core.

Besides, the SPR coupling effect was observed in the compositionally
heterogeneous CS nanostructures where silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
instead of GNPs were used as satellite (Figures 4C,D). It was observed that the SPR peaks
at 408 and 568 nm in the extinction spectrum of CS nanostructure were
red-shifted from the SPR peak of AgNPs (404 nm) and GNPs (541 nm),
indicating the resonance coupling between the plasmas of GNPs and
AgNPs.

The influence of core sizes of NPs on the surface plasmon coupling
effect was further investigated. Compared with Figure 4A,B, 70 nm core GNPs were replaced with 50
nm GNPs to construct the CS nanostructure. It was found that the red-shift
of SPR peak decreased with the decreased size, which also happened
between the AgNP and GNPs (Figure 4C,D).

The above results suggest that the SPCE happened in these CS nanostructures
and the SPR red-shift can be tuned by controlling their size and composition
of satellite and core NPs, besides adjusting the coverage degree of
satellite NPs in the core.

SPR-Enhanced Fluorescence in Living Cells
To enhance
the fluorescence of Cy3 as much as possible, a CS nanostructure with
the number ratio of satellite to core NPs of 5 was constructed. The
measured SPR wavelength of this CS nanostructure may perfectly overlap
with the wavelength of excitation lamp and absorption spectrum of
Cy3, which agrees with the requirements reported by Khatua et al.4b In this designed aptamer, Cy3 was labeled in
the 3 terminal of the aptamer as a fluorophore for enhancement. The
DNA sequence of the aptamer can specifically recognize and bind with
Her2 receptor in the HeLa cells as reported.19 Meanwhile, the aptamer with the thiol group in the terminal was
used as a linker to bind CS nanostructures with cell via the Au–S
bond as shown in Scheme 1. The dark field images of the cells incubated with CS nanostructures
proved the function of the aptamer. Compared with Figure S9A, Figure S9B shows that
the Hela cells appeared to have a higher scattering intensity where
they were incubated with 100 nM aptamer in the binding with nanostructures.
After this interaction, Cy3 due to its flexible arm of DNA was pulled
to the surface of CS nanostructures, which may provides Cy3 a chance
to enter into the SPR hot spots of nanostructures for fluorescence
enhancement.3c

The SPR enhancement
effect on Cy3 is remarkable as shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5A, the fluorescence intensity of cells were
weak when no nanostructures were added. However, a strongly enhanced
fluorescence is observed in Figure 5B where the cells were incubated with CS nanostructures.
The transmission images of HeLa cells can be found in Figure S10A,B. Also, the influence of CS nanostructure
concentration on enhancement was studied as shown in Figure S11. Also, it was found that 50 pM nanostructures had
the optimal concentration to enhance fluorescence. This shows that
the average fluorescent intensity of cells increased from 1475 to
4525 compared with those of the cells without CS nanostructure. Figure 5C,D expresses the
PL decay curves of Cy3 in the cells incubated without or with 50 pM
CS nanostructures, respectively. They are well-fitted by a single
exponential. Figure S12 shows the instrument
response function of time-resolved fluorescence lifetime measurement
system. It was observed that the lifetime of Cy3 decreased from 4.10
to 3.43 ns when cells were incubated with nanostructure. This suggests
that the shorter fluorescence lifetimes are associated with the enhancements.4b

Conclusions
We have developed a facile and controllable clicked-to-assembly
strategy to prepare CS nanostructures based on the click reaction
between TCO and Tz. The time to assemble CS nanostructures is remarkably
shortened compared with that in the present methods. The constructed
nanostructures show excellent uniformity and a high salt tolerance.
The surface plasmon coupling effect occurred in the core, and satellite
NPs resulted in a red-shift effect of the SPR wavelength, which verified
that it may be controlled by number, size, and composition of satellite
and core NPs in these core–satellite nanostructures. The surface
plasmon coupling effect of CS nanostructure is important to construct
the enhancement matrix for fluorescence signal. We believe that this
new method will provide a new avenue for the assembly of core–satellite
nanostructures.

Malvern and gel electrophoresis instrument was from Jim-X Scientific
Instruments (Shanghai, China). Resonance light scattering correlation
spectroscopy system was home-built in the inverted fluorescence microscope
(IX71, Olympus, Japan).20

Synthesis and Characterization of Gold or Silver Nanoparticles
Colloidal citrate-coated GNPs (30, 50 and 70 nm) were synthesized
by a stepwise synthesis according to a reported procedure.16 Twenty nanometers of GNPs were synthesized by
the one-step citrate reduction method. Five nanometers of GNPs were
synthesized by one-step sodium borohydride reduction method. Fifteen
nanometers of silver nanoparticles were synthesized according to a
reported method.21 The details about the
synthesis procedures are described in the Supporting Information. All glassware used for the synthesis of nanoparticles
were soaked in the aqua regia overnight and rinsed with ultrapure
water thoroughly. TEM (JEM-2100HR, JEOL, Japan) and UV–vis
spectra (UV-3502) were used to characterize nanoparticles and their
assemblies such as size, SPR peak, or concentration (Figures S1 and S2).

Preparation of TCO- or Tz-Modified NPs
The TCO- or
Tz-NPs were prepared in three steps. In the first step, TCO or Tz
was reacted and linked with PEG based on the active group NHS and
amine. The same volume of 20 μM HS-PEG-NH2 and TCO–NHS
were mixed in ultrapure water and reacted at room temperature for
4 h to obtain HS-PEG-TCO. Similarly, HS-PEG-Tz was obtained by reacting
same volume of 20 μM PEG-NHS with Tz-NH2. In the
second step, the TCO- or Tz-modified nanoparticles were prepared via
the bonding of Au–S or Ag–S. The prepared Au or silver
nanoparticles (about 1 nM) were mixed with the same volume of HS-PEG-TCO
or HS-PEG-Tz (about 10 μM) and reacted for 12 h in a refrigerator
at 4 °C. Later, to ensure the stability of the modified nanoparticles,
20 μM HS-PEG-COOH was added and continued to react for 4 h.
In the third step, the centrifugation was used to remove free HS-PEG-COOH,
HS-PEG-Tz, and HS-PEG-TCO and the precipitate was redispersed in the
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. The molar concentration
of the prepared TCO- and Tz-NPs was determined based on their absorbance
at the SPR peak or measured with our developed RLSCS method.

Assembly of CS Nanostructures
Different CS nanostructures
were constructed by reacting Tz-NPs as the core with TCO-NPs as the
satellite particles at room temperature for about 8 min. Their feeding
ratio was adjusted according to the expected satellite number in the
surface of core GNPs. The product was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for
20 min, and the precipitate was redispersed in PBS solution.

Gel Electrophoresis
A 0.5% agarose gel was used and
10 μL of the sample mixed with the 6 × loading buffer was
added to the bottom of the sample well. The samples were subjected
to gel electrophoresis separation with a voltage of 120 V. After the
electrophoresis is completed, the experimental results are photographed
and collected.

Fluorescent Labeling of Her2 Receptor in Living Cells
HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells
were grown in a humidified air atmosphere with 5% CO2 at
37 °C. After reaching 70% confluence in a 35 mm culture dish,
the cells were rinsed with PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4). The cells were co-incubated
with different concentrations of Cy3-modified aptamers to bind with
Her2 receptor for 4 h. Then, the cells were rinsed with PBS buffer
for three times to remove the free aptamers.

Fluorescence Quenching of Cy3 with MV
Ten millimolar
of MV in PBS buffer was added into the HeLa cell labeled with Cy3
probe to quench the fluorescence of Cy3. The incubation time is 15
min. Then, the cells were rinsed with PBS solution for three times
to remove free MV. The obtained cells were used for further surface-enhanced
fluorescence experiments. Cellular images before fluorescence enhancement
were collected using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus,
Japan) with a 40× objective and an EMCCD (Evolve 512, Photometrics).
The fluorescence intensity of the cells was extracted with micromanager
software (NIH).

CS Nanostructure-Induced Surface-Enhanced Fluorescence
CS nanostructures of different concentrations were incubated with
the above cells. The incubation time is 2 h. Then, the cells were
rinsed with PBS solution for three times to remove the unbound CS
nanostructures. Then, fluorescent images of the cells were collected
and the extracted fluorescent intensity was compared with the cells
without CS nanostructures.
