A domino
synthesis of 3-indolylquinones was achieved successfully
via direct oxidative C–C coupling of hydroquinones with indoles
over Ag2O and Fe3O4/povidone–phosphotungstic
acid (PVP–PWA) catalysts using H2O2 in
tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. Ag2O catalyzed the
in situ oxidation of hydroquinone and 3-indolylhydroquinone intermediates,
whereas ferrite solid acid, Fe3O4/PVP–PWA,
with a 1:4:1 ratio of Fe3O4, PVP, and PWA, catalyzed
the activation of quinones. The efficiency of this catalytic domino
approach was established by a broad scope of substrates involving
a variety of hydroquinones and quinones to give high yields (81–97%)
of 3-indolylquinones. Fe3O4/PVP–PWA was
separated magnetically, whereas simple filtration could separate Ag2O, both of which could be recycled several times without losing
their activities.

Introduction
3-Indolylquinones are
core structures of highly significant biologically
active natural products called “asterriquinones”, which
are found in fungal species like Aspergillus terreus, Chaetomium sp., and Pseudomassaria sp.1−5 Asterriquinones are emerging as potential pharmacophores
due to their wide range of biological activities, including inhibition
of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase;6−8 these also act as antitumor agents to promote apoptotic cell death.9,10 Among these, demethylasterriquinone B1, an orally active insulin
mimetic with excellent antidiabetic activity, exhibits nonprotein
behavior (Figure 1).11 3-Indolylquinone represents a pharmacophore
for protein–protein interactions and thus should be antagonistic
toward bis-indolylquinones in asterriquinones. 3-Indolylquinone could
be used in the total synthesis of asterriquinones and also as reagents
to probe the biological activity of indolylquinones.

Figure 1 Structures of some biologically
active asterriquinone derivatives.

3-Indolylquinones were first synthesized by Möhlau
et al.
in 1911, who obtained a red product from the reaction of benzoquinone
and indole; however, this product was not isolated.12 Further, in 1951 Bu’Lock reinvestigated and isolated
3-indolylquinones in a very low yield.13 Thereafter, high-yield synthesis of 3-indolylquinones was achieved
using excess quinone in presence of a clay catalyst,14 InBr3,15 and Bi(OTf)216 under mild reaction conditions.
Similarly, various efforts have been made by Park and co-workers with
mineral acids, Zn(OTf)2, and mercury reagents along with
Pd(II)/Cu(OAc)2.17−19 Synthesis of 3-indolylquinones
was also attempted by ultrasound activation using molecular iodine
as a catalyst20 and using nano iron hydroxide21 and also through catalyst-free-water-promoted
reactions.22 The cheap external oxidant
DDQ with Ag2CO3 on celite was explored to avoid
excess use of costly quinone substrates to oxidize the intermediate
under intensive conditions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under reflux for
a long reaction time.23,24 Nevertheless, these protocols
suffered serious environmental problems, like cumbersome workup to
separate the byproducts, such as hydroquinones, and loss of reusability
and recyclability of the catalysts. Hence, we developed a novel catalytic
system for oxidation of hydroquinone followed by C–C bond formation,
resulting in efficient synthesis of 3-indolylquinones. Our approach
is unique in that it eliminates the use of excessive quinone, which
produces hydroquinone that necessitates separation from the crude
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 General
Reaction Scheme for the Synthesis of 3-Indolylquinone
In this article, we envisioned the direct oxidative
C–C
coupling of hydroquinones and indoles at room temperature (RT) over
recyclable Ag2O and Fe3O4/povidone–phosphotungstic
acid (PVP–PWA) (141) catalysts. The catalyst Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) has been recently reported by
us for the synthesis of 2-cyanoacrylamides.25 Characterization details, such as data from transmission electron
microscopy, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area measurements are provided in the Supporting Information
(Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S1). Although Ag2O and m-CPBA have been reported for the oxidation of hydroquinones and phenols
to benzoquinones, respectively,26,27 surprisingly, none
of them have yet been explored for the synthesis of 3-indolylquinones.
Hence, in situ production of quinones from hydroquinones over Ag2O was considered for the synthesis of 3-indolylquinones (Scheme 2). Subsequent activation
of quinones without isolation was achieved with the solid acid catalyst
Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) for addition to indoles.

Results and Discussion
Study
of Oxidizing Agents and Catalysts
As the first
step of our strategy involves in situ oxidation of hydroquinones to
quinones, the study of different oxidants and catalysts was mandatory,
and the results are presented in Table 1.

a Reactions were performed with 1:1
2-methylhydroquinone/2-methylindole, 0.1 g Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141), 3 mmol oxidant, 10 mL of THF, and 20 mol %
catalyst in 1 atm air/oxygen at RT for 2 h. NR, no reaction; isolated
yield of 3-indolylquinone after column chromatography. Bold values
represent maximum product yield under optimized reaction conditions.

b The product 3-indolylhydroquinone
is formed.

Initially, air,
oxygen, and H2O2 were used
for the oxidation of hydroquinone (1a) without any catalyst,
but no products were obtained, implying that not only the oxidant
but also a suitable catalyst was needed for the oxidation (Table 1, entries 1–3).
Therefore, MoO3 and WO3 were evaluated as oxidation
catalysts in presence of H2O2, which gave 10
and 15% yields, respectively (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141) was also evaluated as a catalyst for this oxidation due to the
presence of WO3, but only a 10% yield was obtained, similar
to that obtained with pure WO3 (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Although a well-known
oxidation catalyst, Ag2O when used alone yielded only 30%
3-indolylquinone (3a) and 40% 3-indolylhydroquinone (4). This is due to the fact that reduced Ag could not be reoxidized
to Ag2O (Table 1, entry 7). Surprisingly, Ag2O in presence of air
and oxygen as oxidants also showed poor performances, with yields
of 3a (about 25 and 27%, respectively) and 4 (45 and 41%, respectively) similar to those obtained in absence
of an oxidant (Table 1, entries 8 and 9). When Ag2O was combined with H2O2, the product yield increased to 94%. H2O2 when used as an oxidant with AgNO3 as a
catalyst gave only a 35% yield of 3a (Table 1, entries 10 and 11). Thus,
Ag2O in the presence of H2O2 served
as the best catalyst for the oxidation of 1a and 3-indolylhydroquinone
(4) during the synthesis of 3a. Various
other oxidants, like DDQ and KBrO3, gave product yields
of 41 and 10%, with 55 and 30% of 4, respectively (Table 1, entries 12 and 13).
Interestingly, K4FeCN6 and oxone did not furnish
any products (Table 1, entries 14 and 15).

Optimization of Acid Catalysts
Having
established the
first oxidation step catalyzed by Ag2O to give quinone,
we then screened several solid acid catalysts for the synthesis of
3-indolylquinones, and the results are summarized in Table 2.

a Reactions were performed with 1:1
2-methylhydroquinone/2-methylindole, 0.1 g Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141), 20 mol % Ag2O, 1.5 [quinone]/3
[hydroquinone] mmol H2O2, and 10 mL of THF at
RT for 5 h; isolated yields of 3a after column chromatography.
Bold values represent maximum product yield under optimized reaction
conditions.

b Reflux condition.

c Byproduct 2-methylbenzoquinone
was
obtained (5).

d 2-Methylbenzoquinone was used as
the reactant.

A control
reaction of 2-methylhydroquinone (1a) with
2-methylindole (2a) in the presence of Ag2O and H2O2 furnished 5a in 86%
yield, without the formation of 3a (Table 2, entry 1).

PVP and Fe3O4 did not produce 3a, and only 5a was produced (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). To accomplish C–C
coupling of the oxidation product quinone (5a) with indole
(2a), several acid catalysts were screened. Initially,
commercially available Amberlyst-15 gave only 12% of 3a, with 67% of 5a (Table 2, entry 4). The yield of 3a increased
to 71% with PWA which clearly indicated that strong acid sites were
necessary to catalyze the C–C coupling of 1a and 2a (Table 2, entry 5). PVP–PWA showed the highest yield of 3a, of 83%, as compared with other heteropoly acids, such as PMA and
STA, on PVP (Table 2, entries 6–8).

A triple composite of PVP–PWA
with Fe3O4, designated as Fe3O4/PVP–PWA, which
was previously reported by our group as the best solid acid catalyst,24 with varying mole ratios of Fe3O4, PVP, and PWA in this work exhibited different levels of
activity; for example, a 1:3:1 composition gave the product in 75%
yield, whereas a 1:4:1 composition enhanced the yield of 3a to 94% (Table 2,
entries 9 and 10). With a further increase in PVP, the yields of 3a and 5a markedly reduced to 42 and 32% (Table 2, entry 11). This
could be attributed to the masking of acid sites by a higher concentration
of PVP. At a higher temperature (under reflux) the yield of 3a remained almost same as that at RT (Table 2, entry 12). 5a when used as
a substrate yielded 97% of 3a, which clearly confirmed
the high reactivity of quinones under our standard reaction conditions
(Table 2, entry 13).
Thus, Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) was chosen
as the best catalyst for further studies on the synthesis of 3-indolylquinones.

Solvent Screening
Table 3 illustrates the results of screening solvents for
the synthesis of 3-indolylquinone (3a) by reacting 1a and 2-methylindole 2a over a combination of
Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) and Ag2O in H2O2 at RT.

3-indolylquinone after column chromatography. Bold values represent
maximum product yield under optimized reaction conditions.

b The byproduct is 4-methoxy-hydroquinone
(6).

c The byproduct
2-methylbenzoquinone
was formed.

A control experiment
without any solvent gave a very poor yield
of <10% of 3a even after a reaction time of 10 h,
due to lack of a homogeneous reaction phase (Table 3, entry 1). With water as a solvent, 3a was obtained in 12% yield even after a prolonged reaction
time, with oxidation product 5a (67%; Table 3, entry 2) being present in
majority. A highly polar and protic solvent like methanol gave the
desired C–C coupling product 3a in 45% yield,
but etherification was also observed to give 4-methoxy-hydroquinone
(6) (10%), along with 20% of 5a (Table 3, entry 3). 1,4-Dioxane
and DCM gave only 10 and 18% yields, respectively, after 8–9
h (Table 3, entries
4 and 5), whereas ACN as a solvent enhanced the yield of the desired
product to 68%, with 24% of 5a (Table 3, entry 6). The maximum yield of 3a achieved was 93%, when THF was used as a solvent, in a very short
reaction time of about 2 h (Table 3, entry 7). Hence, THF was identified as the most suitable
solvent for the synthesis of 3-indolylquinones under optimized reaction
conditions.

Effect of Catalyst Amount
As the
availability of active
sites varied with a variation in the catalyst amount, the latter had
a considerable effect on product yields, and the results are presented
in Table 4.

b Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141) (0.1 g).

c The byproduct
2-methyl benzoquinone
is formed.

Initially, the
amount of Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141) was varied from 0.025 to 0.150 g by keeping Ag2O
at a constant concentration of 20 mol %. It was observed that the
yield of the desired product, 3a, was also enhanced.
At 0.025 g, the catalyst produced only 60% of 3a, with
21% of 5a (Table 4, entry 1). The yield of product 3a increased
up to 82% on doubling the catalyst amount, but still, 6% of 5a was observed (Table 4, entry 2). On further increasing the catalyst amount to 0.1
g, 94% of the desired product, 3a, was obtained, without
the formation of the intermediate. Above 0.1 g, no effect of catalyst
amount on the product yield was observed (Table 4, entry 4). Keeping Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) at an optimum value of 0.1 g, an increase in
Ag2O led to an ascending trend in the yield of 3a. Ag2O at 5 mol % gave the lowest yield of 23%, whereas
an excellent yield of up to 95% was observed with 20 mol % of the
catalyst. Further increasing the Ag2O concentration to
40 mol % did not enhance the product yield (Table 4, entries 5–9); thus, 20 mol % Ag2O was most optimal for oxidation of hydroquinone to 3-indolylquinone.

Substrate
Scope
The excellent performance of the catalyst
system with Ag2O and Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141) in the single-pot synthesis of 3-indolylquinones encouraged
us to elaborate their applications for a broad substrate scope involving
a variety of hydroquinones and quinones with various indoles at RT.
As shown in Table 5, excellent yields of 3-indolylquinones (3a–n) of up to 96% were obtained upon reacting 1,4-naphthoquinone with
various indoles having electron-donating groups, as in the case of
1-methyl, 2-methyl, and 1-methyl-2-phenyl indoles. However, the activity
shown by 1H-indole was lower even after a prolonged
reaction time of 5 h (Table 5, entries 3b–e). Electron-donating groups
present on the phenyl ring of indoles also helped elevate the product
yields (Table 5, entries 3f–g).

Table 5 Substrate Scope for

Synthesis of 3-Indolylquinones from Hydroquinones Using Ag2O/H2O2 and Fe3O4/PVP–PWA

a Reactions were
performed with 1:1
hydroquinone/indole, 0.1 g Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141), 20 mol % Ag2O, 3 mmol H2O2, and 10 mL of THF at RT for 2–5 h; isolated yields after
column chromatography.

1,4-Benzoquinones
smoothly reacted with 2-methyl and 1-methyl indole
to give 93 and 97% yields of the corresponding products; however,
indole provided only a moderate yield (81%) (Table 5, entries 3h–k and 3a). 2,5-Dichloroquinones also reacted efficiently with indoles,
giving high product yields of 89–95% (Table 5, entries 3l–n). Thus,
the suitability of our approach for single-pot synthesis of 3-indolylquinones
starting from hydroquinones and involving oxidative C–C coupling
over Ag2O-Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141)
could be successfully demonstrated.

The conventional synthesis
of 3-indolylquinones from indoles and
quinones was also evaluated with our Ag2O/H2O2 and Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141)
catalyst system in THF at RT. Table 6 shows that 2-methylindole (2a) reacted
actively with 1,4-naphthoquinone and benzoquinone to produce excellent
yields of the products of up to 97 and 94% (Table 6, entries 3d and 3h). Similarly, 1-methyl-2-phenyl indole with benzoquinone also provided
a high yield of 91% (Table 6, entry 3i). 2-Methylbenzoquinone treated with
1H- and 2-methyl-indole gave 83 and 89% yields of
the products, respectively (Table 6, entries 3j and 3a). 2,5-Dichlorobenzoquinone
also provided 95–97% yields of the products with various indoles
(Table 6, entries 3l and 3m).

Reaction Pathway
The reaction pathway for the synthesis
of 3-indolylquinone, as proposed in Figure 2, commences with the in situ oxidation of
hydroquinone (A) to quinone (B) over a Ag2O catalyst. This
is followed by the activation of quinone, which forms a C–C
bond with indoles over Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141) to give 3-indolylhydroquinone (C), and the catalyst Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) is regenerated for the next cycle.
Finally, 3-indolylhydroquinone further oxidized to 3-indolylquinone
(D) by Ag2O regenerated by H2O2.

Figure 2 Proposed
reaction pathway for the direct oxidative synthesis of
3-indolylquinone.

Recycle Study
The magnetic nature of catalyst Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141) allowed its retention in
the flask, whereas simple filtration of the reaction crude could offer
easy recovery of Ag2O (Figure 3). Following this procedure, several catalyst-recycling
experiments were performed for both 2-methylhydroquinone and 2-methylbenzoquinone
substrates separately with 2-methylindole under our standard reaction
conditions to give 3-indolylquinones in 95 and 97% yields, respectively.
After repeating the reactions for four times with the reused catalysts,
only marginal decreases in the yields, up to 91 and 92%, respectively,
were observed for both substrates (Figure 4). The absence of “W”, “Fe”,
and “Ag” in the ICP-OES study in the filtrate after
the last recycle run also confirmed the stability of both the catalysts
under our standard reaction conditions. Thus, catalysts Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) and Ag2O could be efficiently
recycled, which also established the stability of the catalyst system.

experiment.

at RT for 2 h; isolated yield of the 3-indolylquinones after column
chromatography.

Stability of the Catalyst
Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141)
The stability of the Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
(141) catalyst was also confirmed by studying the Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of fresh and used catalyst samples. Characteristic
peaks of Keggin ions were distinctly observed at 1078, 976, 893, and
808 cm–1 for the fresh Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) sample in Figure 5, corresponding to the terminal oxygen of
P–O, W=O, the corner-sharing oxygen of W–Ob–W,
and the edge-sharing oxygen of W–Oc–W, respectively
(Figure 5A). All of
these peaks were also observed at nearly the same position in the
recovered catalyst sample after reaction (Figure 5B), which confirmed the retention of PWA
in the catalyst, Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141),
after reaction even under oxidation conditions.

Conclusions
We
newly developed an efficient catalytic system combining Ag2O in H2O2 and Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
for the domino synthesis of 3-indolylquinones in
high-to-excellent yields (81–97%). Various oxidizing agents
and catalysts were screened for oxidation, but Ag2O in
H2O2 was able to oxidize both hydroquinones
and 3-indolylhydroquinones over a very short reaction time. Among
the different Fe3O4/PVP–PWA catalytic
systems prepared with varying mole ratios of Fe3O4, PVP, and PWA, the Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141)
catalytic system showed rapid activation of the quinones. FT-IR study
also revealed the retention of the heteropoly acid structure in the
catalyst Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141) after reaction,
which confirmed the stability of the catalyst under H2O2. The applicability of our catalyst system was proven for
a broad substrate scope with various hydroquinones and benzoquinones
with indoles under the standard reaction conditions. Recycling experiments
proved that both the catalysts, Ag2O and Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141), were efficiently recycled at
least up to four times for hydroquinone and benzoquinone without any
loss of activity.

Experimental Section
Materials and General Methods
All reactions were carried
out in a flame-dried glass apparatus under an open atmosphere using
analytical reagent-grade dried solvents procured from Aldrich, Alfa
Aser, Thomas Baker, etc. Heteropoly acids were purchased from Thomas
Baker, and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates were purchased from
Loba. The products were separated using 100–200 mesh silica
for column chromatography, with 5% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether
as the mobile phase; characterized by 1H NMR, using DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 (0.01% TMS) as the solvent,
on a 200 MHz frequency Bruker instrument; and compared with authentic
samples reported in the literature. FT-IR spectroscopy was performed
on a PerkinElmer frontier instrument in the ATR (PIKE make) mode at
RT.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of the Catalyst Fe3O4/PVP–PWA
Fe3O4/PVP–PWA was synthesized with varying ratios of Fe3O4, PVP, and PWA, 1:4:1, 1:3:1, and 1:8:1, as required
and designated as Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (131),
Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (141), or Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (181).

PVP (0.333/0.444/0.888
g, 3/4/8 mmol) was taken in a 250 mL round-bottom flask as per requirement.
Thereafter, the solution of PWA (2.880 g, 1 mmol) in 30 mL of distilled
water was added dropwise with stirring using an addition funnel for
15 min. Simultaneously, Fe3O4 (0.231 g, 1 mmol)
was added and the mixture was stirred for 12 h at RT; a brown precipitate
was obtained. Water was removed from the mixture on a rotavapor for
2 h at 80 °C. Finally, the brown powdered catalyst was obtained
in 95% yield, which was then dried at 100 °C for 6 h.

Experimental
Procedure for the Synthesis of Quinones Using Ag2O
Some quinones were synthesized from hydroquinones
using the reported procedure, with slight modifications.25 To a mixture of hydroquinone (1 mmol), Ag2O (0.2 mmol), and THF (5 mL) stirred for 5 min was added dropwise
a solution of 30% aq. H2O2 (2.5 mmol) in THF
(5 mL) under stirring for 10 min at RT. Then, the mixture was continuously
stirred for 1–2 h at RT, and progress of the reaction was monitored
by TLC. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was diluted with water
(15 mL) and then extracted with diethyl ether (2 × 25 mL). The
combined organic layers were washed with brine (2 × 15 mL) and
dried over Na2SO4. The solvents were evaporated
under reduced pressure, affording quinones in up to 90% yield.

General
Procedure for the Synthesis of 3-Indolylquinones from
Hydroquinone and Benzoquinones
Catalyst Fe3O4/PVP–PWA (0.1 g) was added to a solution of benzoquinone
or hydroquinone (1 mmol) and indole (1 mmol) in a 25 mL round-bottom
flask containing 5 mL of THF. The solution was then stirred and Ag2O (0.2 mmol) was added to the mixture. Finally, 30% aq. H2O2 (1.5 mmol for benzoquinone and 3 mmol for hydroquinone)
in 5 mL of THF was added dropwise to the mixture using an addition
funnel over 15 min (the THF/H2O2 with Ag2O used here was completely safe and nonexplosive because the
ratio of THF/H2O2 was 46:1 and the reaction
was carried out at RT, 25 °C). Thereafter, the reaction mixture
was stirred again, and progress of the reaction was monitored using
TLC. After completion of the reaction, catalyst Fe3O4/PVP–PWA separated using a magnet and the solution
was filtered to separate the Ag2O. After evaporation of
THF, the crude was further extracted with ethyl acetate and washed
with 30 mL of water to remove excess H2O2. Finally,
the compounds were separated by column chromatography.
