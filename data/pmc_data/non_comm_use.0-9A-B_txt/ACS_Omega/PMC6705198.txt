The
graphitic carbon nitride/tin oxide (g-C3N4/SnO2) nanocomposite synthesized under microwave irradiation
was used for adsorptive removal of sulfur-containing dibenzothiophene
(DBT) from Tehran vehicular gasoline. High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy
techniques determined the adsorbent characteristics, and gas chromatography
with a flame ionization detector determined the DBT concentration
of the samples. Application of the experimental data into the solid/fluid
kinetic models indicated a chemisorption control regime that increased
the removal of sulfur from the commercial samples used. A pseudo-second-order
reaction with the rate constant of 0.015 (g mg–1 min–1) and total conversion time of 316 min described
the adsorption process. Based on the real fuel results, the adsorption
capacity of the g-C3N4/SnO2 adsorbent
reached 10.64 mg S g–1 adsorbent at equilibrium
conditions. This value was the highest adsorption capacity obtained
so far for a commercial gasoline sample. The g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite could, therefore, be introduced
as an inexpensive, easily obtainable adsorbent that can significantly
remove the sulfur from the vehicular gasoline fuels.

Introduction
Environmental concerns have compelled
fuel refineries to remove
the sulfur-containing compounds from transportation fuels.1,2 Removal of sulfur compounds leads to increase of combustion engine
lifetime and positive environmental attitudes. Research on clean fuel
has been considered for many years to reduce air pollution and prevent
the introduction of pollutants into the environment.3,4 Existing sulfur compounds in fuel cause emission of SOx, which increases the possibility of acid rain.4−6 Accordingly, many strict regulations have been established in many
countries to reduce sulfur content in public transportation fuels
such as diesel and gasoline.7 Recent regulations
for the reduction of the current sulfur content to less than 10 ppm
have been proposed.8

Improvement
of the fuel cell technology is now a hot issue in research
and development units of the industries. Fuel cells consume gasoline
and diesel as the direct or indirect primary fuels. Since a solid
oxide fuel cell works at high temperatures, the sulfur content should
be less than 10 ppm. Furthermore, deep desulfurization below 1 ppm
for proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell is also required.2,9,10

Traditional hydrodesulfurization
has been used to lower sulfur
content as a conventional process.11 This
process is complicated and costly especially for the removal of some
sulfur compounds like dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives that
are present in a few tens of ppm when a profound desulfurization goal
is usually required.5,12−14 Besides, about
90% of the sulfur content of the studied gasoline in this research
is in DBT. The removal of these compounds from transportation fuels
(primarily diesel and gasoline) has been a controversial topic in
the industry.15,16 In this regard, alternative or
complementary desulfurization processes for ultralow sulfur fuel production
have been evolved such as oxidative desulfurization,17−20 biodesulfurization,21 extraction,22−25 and adsorptive desulfurization.26−29 Investigations have shown that
adsorptive desulfurization is a promising procedure at the ambient
temperature and pressure because of its low-energy consumption and
investment costs.

Various adsorbents have been studied before.
Yang and co-workers
used π-complexation-based sorbents that were obtained by ion-exchanging
faujasite-type zeolites with Cu+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ cations. They reported Cu(I)-Y (VPIE) as the best sorbent
with adsorption capacities of 0.395 and 0.278 (mmol S g–1 sorbent) for commercial jet fuel and diesel, respectively.30 Over past 2 decades, several studies have been
conducted on using zeolite,31 alumina,27 mesoporous silica,32 and activated carbon33 as supports for
various sorbents to remove sulfur-containing compounds. For instance,
Sarda et al. prepared adsorbents by varying the Ni/Cu loadings onto
ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 20) and the activated alumina for removal of sulfur
from diesel fuel. Their results showed that sulfur removal strongly
depends on the nature and amount of the metal and the support material.
Their results showed that the activated alumina has a higher sulfur
removal power than ZSM-5 due to the more facile diffusion of the large
sulfur molecules to the larger pores of the activated alumina than
ZSM-5.27

Tin oxide has recently been
used in a variety of applications such
as gas sensors, dye-based solar cells, optoelectronic devices, electrode
materials, and catalysis.34 The presence
of active sites on the surface of SnO2 particles results
in a suitable catalytic behavior.35 In
a previous study, the authors presented the synthesis and characteristics
of the porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanocomposite,36 which seemed usable
for the construction of the support substance needed for sulfur removal
from the hydrocarbon fuels. According to our knowledge, the g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite has not been used
as the adsorbent of sulfur compounds in any studies until now. This
study aims to find a high-capacity adsorbent for the removal of sulfur
from a highly used commercial petroleum product. Effects of contact
time and adsorbent dose on sulfur-containing DBT removal from the
regular gasoline of a local Iranian gas station are investigated.
Different mathematical correlations are examined to find out the appropriate
kinetic model that governs the process. The implication of the devised
technique leads to the maximum adsorption capacity of 10.64 mg S g–1 adsorbent, which is obtainable after reaching the
equilibrium conditions.

Results and Discussion
The X-ray
powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite before and after calcination
are shown in Figure 1. The design of the calcined powder represents the significant formation
of the tetragonal-phase SnO2 according to JCPDS card no.
88-0287 with the characteristic peaks located at 2θ angles of
26.50, 33.86, and 51.84°. The magnified portion of the figure
indicates the existence of a peak at 26.74°. This peak belongs
to the g-C3N4 (002) crystallographic plane.37 g-C3N4 has another peak
at 13.66°, which is also observed in the XRD pattern shown in Figure 1. Overlapping of
the characteristic SnO2 (110) peak with the g-C3N4 (002) peak has been the source of confusion in analyzing
the XRD patterns of the g-C3N4/SnO2 composites, as reported in the previous papers.36,38 The current study resolved the issue by nanocomposite powder calcination
at 550 °C. Based on the JCPDS Card No. 26-1076, the third peak
seen in the magnified insets of Figures 1 and 9 attributes
to the carbon hexagonal phase. During powder calcination at 550 °C,
a meager amount of g-C3N4 decomposes to this hardly observable tiny
phase, plus evolving gaseous nitrogen. The crystallite average size
of different nanocomposite samples was evaluated from the Scherrer
equation.39 It was ∼14.59 nm before
heating and 18.83 nm after calcination, which confirmed particle size
growth during calcination.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite (a) before calcination (b) after calcination

°C for 1 h.

Field-emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM) and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to determine the
morphology of the g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite.
In Figure 2a, the stacked
layers of graphitic carbon nitride with a dimension of about 34.12
μm and highlighted pores are observable. The structure of the
sample is less porous than the g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite produced in our previous research.36 During irradiation with microwave, some urea
molecules decomposed to gaseous products that tended to exit from
the graphitic layers of C3N4 toward the root
to the porous structure.36 Consequently,
the lower amount of urea (the precursor for the fabrication of the
g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite) could
result in fewer porosities produced in this study sample.

nitride sheet, (b) SnO2 nanoparticles scattered on the
g-C3N4 sheets, (c) SnO2 nanoparticles’

g-C3N4 sheets, and (e) lattice fingers of the
SnO2 nanoparticles.

Figure 2b shows
the SnO2 nanoparticles scattered on g-C3N4 sheets. From image analysis, the average diameter of these
particles is ∼23.58 nm. Figure 2d displays the HRTEM image of the SnO2 nanoparticles
(the darker area) accumulated on a carbon nitride sheet. An average
diameter of ∼14 nm was obtained from the image. This value
agreed well with the crystallite size obtained from the XRD by the
Scherrer equation. Hindering the particle growth together with a hefty
gas evolution due to urea decomposition caused the decrease in average
size to ∼14 nm. The lattice fingers of the sample are illustrated
in Figure 2e. The lattice
distance measured is ∼0.26 nm, which is indexed as the (101)
plane of the SnO2 as depicted in the XRD pattern in Figure 1.

Figure 3 shows the
elemental maps, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum,
and the analysis of the g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite produced in this research. According to the maps,
all elements (carbon, nitrogen, tin, and oxygen) are uniformly distributed
in the sample. The overlap of the elemental maps supports a well-coupled
SnO2 structure on the g-C3N4 layers.40 The atomic ratio of the Sn–O in the studied
area of Figure 3b is
not far from 1:2 of a stable SnO2 molecule. The ratio higher
than 3:4 for carbon/nitrogen is due to the decomposition of the stray
hydrocarbon complexes that may have contaminated the production chamber.

Figure 4a illustrates
nitrogen adsorption/desorption for the g-C3N4/SnO2. The shape of the curves and hysteresis loop suggests
type IV isotherms for the sample, which indicates the existence of
mesopores.41 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of the sample was calculated to be 66.36 m2 g–1. Figure 4b shows the pore size distributions of the g-C3N4/SnO2 via the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda)
model. Accordingly, the BJH pore volume and the mean pore diameter
were measured to be 0.43 cm3 g–1 and
18.76 nm, respectively.

Figure 5 illustrates
the effect of contact time on the local gasoline DBT adsorption at
298 K. The original DBT content of the gasoline was 358.51 mg DBT
L–1 (62.38 mg S L–1), and its
final content after full adsorption was 168.89 mg DBT L–1 (28.68 mg S L–1). Figure 5 indicates that fast initial adsorption is
followed by a slow-down rate that tends to reach the equilibrium state
after 180 min. The equilibrium amount is, therefore, ∼3.37
mg S g–1 adsorbent. This change is due to the reduction
of the active adsorbent sites by adsorbing sulfur atoms.

time on S removal from gasoline by g-C3N4/SnO2 (adsorbent mass = 0.1 g; T = 25 °C).

Effect of Adsorbent Dose on Sulfur Removal
Different
doses of the adsorbent were added to each sample at 298 K to remove
sulfur from gasoline of the local gas station. The data obtained after
stirring the mixture for 360 min were plotted against the adsorbent
weight (see Figure 6). The best-fit curve plotted in Figure 6 was used to determine the equilibrium data
tabulated in Table 1. These data showed that the sulfur removal tends to 75.45% of the
initial value by an adsorbent amount approaching to 1 g in weight.
This increase indicated more favorable adsorption conditions with
a higher number of particles of larger specific surface areas.

adsorbent dose on the removal of the sulfur (V =
10 mL, T = 25 °C).

The gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector
(GC-FID)
chromatogram peaks of the DBT compound obtained from the initial and
the desulfurized gasoline samples are compared in Figure 7. The noticeable decline of
the areas under the curves by the adsorbent amount represents the
rising of desulfurization by the adsorbent amount. This rising trend
supports the data plotted in Figure 6.

Adsorption Isotherms
Removal of sulfur was due to the
adsorption of DBT by g-C3N4/SnO2 that
was modeled by two sorption isotherms, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevitch.
The characteristic parameters of the models were evaluated from the
slope and the intercept of the plots using regression analysis. The
linear form of the Freundlich isotherm is as follows42 1  where qe is the
removed amount of sulfur after stirring the mixture for 360 min (mg
S g–1 adsorbent), Ce is the equilibrium sulfur concentration (mg S L–1), and kf [in (mg g–1)(mg–1 L)1/n] and n
are the Freundlich constants representing the adsorption capacity
and rate, respectively.43

The linear
form of the Dubinin–Radushkevitch (D–R) isotherm is as follows43 2  where qm (mg g–1) is the theoretical saturation
capacity, β
(mol2 J–2) is the constant related to
the mean free energy of adsorption, and ε is the Polany potential
that is equal to44 3  In this equation, R (J mol–1 K–1) and T (K)
are the ideal gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively.
The adsorption average free energy (E, J mol–1) is related to the change of free energy when 1 mole
of the adsorbate transfers from infinity to the surface of the adsorbent
in the solution. E can be evaluated from constant
β using the following relationship45 4  The Freundlich constants kf and n were evaluated from
the data
plotted in Figure 8a and are summarized in Table 2. The values of β and qm of the the D–R isotherm
were also obtained from Figure 8b and are tabulated in Table 2. As can be seen in Figure 8 and also in Table 2, the experimental data for removal of sulfur
by g-C3N4/SnO2 fits better with the
Freundlich isotherm (R2 = 0.997) than
with the D–R isotherm (R2 = 0.973). The reason for better fitting of
the former is the heterogeneous surface bindings assumed in the Freundlich
isotherm.46 The low value of E (60.86 J mol–1) indicates that the physical adsorption
dominates the system.43,45 As a result, the main factor
contributing in the mechanism of adsorption is van der Waals interaction
forces between adsorbates and adsorbents.43

In this study, the maximum adsorption
capacity of g-C3N4/SnO2 was obtained
to be 8.60 mg S g–1 adsorbent, which is 80.83% of
the theoretical saturation
capacity generated from the D–R isotherm model. The desulfurization value obtained in this research
for the local commercial gasoline, which contained diverse aromatic
hydrocarbons, was the highest amount achieved so far. Previous researchers
had obtained a relatively low value of 3.5 mg S g–1 by graphenelike boron nitride,26 2.18
mg S g–1 by the Ni/SiO2-Al2O3 adsorbent and 1.57 mg S g–1 by activated
alumina,47 0.32 mg S g–1 by zeolite as an adsorbent,27 1.2 mg
S g–1 by 15%TiO2/C–SiO2,48 and 7.3 mg S g–1 by utilization of 55 wt % metallic Ni with silica–alumina
as support of the adsorbent.49 The authors
focused on the removal of sulfur from the DBT because it was the highest
sulfur-containing compound of the selected gasoline.

Removal Mechanism
The XRD pattern of the adsorbent
after adsorption was surveyed to confirm the adsorption of DBT on
the g-C3N4/SnO2. As shown in Figure 9, all of the characteristic peaks of the SnO2 can
be seen according to JCPDS card no. 88-0287. Also, the characteristic
g-C3N4 peaks were located at 2θ angles
of 27.04 and 13.54°. Therefore, the results indicate that the
adsorbent has been stable after the adsorption test. Besides, the
peaks at 2θ angles of 28.06, 23.19, and 17.40° belong to
the DBT compound according to JCPDS card no. 34-1687.

Figure 9 XRD pattern of the adsorbent
after the adsorption test.

The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) pattern was
studied to characterize the structure of the adsorbent (g-C3N4/SnO2) before and after the adsorption test.
As depicted in Figure 10a, the infra red (IR) peak at around 603.87 cm–1 corresponds to the Sn–O stretching vibration, which is related
to the characteristic peak of SnO2. The peaks at 1403,
1630, and 1722 cm–1 are attributed to the stretching
mode of C–N heterocycles. The peaks at 806 and 1047 cm–1 could be ascribed to the tri-s-triazine
ring.36,50 All of the reported IR peaks from 806 to
1722 cm–1 are characteristic of g-C3N4. Also, the peaks at 2858 cm–1 and in the
region from 300 to 3500 cm–1 are attributed to the
stretching vibrations of −CHx groups,
the N–H bond, and the surface-adsorbed OH groups. These results demonstrate the
synthesized adsorbent in which the g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite contains both g-C3N4 and
SnO2. According to Figure 10b, the characteristic peaks of the g-C3N4/SnO2 still can be seen in the FTIR spectrum of
the utilized adsorbent that represents the stability of the adsorbent
after the adsorption test. Besides, the main peaks corresponding to
DBT could be distinguished. The bands at 1376 and 2924 cm–1 could be allocated to the thiophene ring and C–H in the benzene
ring.51 Also, the band at 1376 cm–1 along with the weak band at 1413 cm–1 suggests
that thiophene coordinates via its sulfur atom to unoccupied metal
sites (Sn),52 as depicted in Figure 11. Some mechanisms
involving π-complexation, which is the formation of bonds between
a pair of electrons of sulfur and thin empty s-orbitals, could occur
in addition to van der Waals interactions. While for g-C3N4, the most DBT adsorption can probably rely on the physical
adsorption of pore channels.

Table 3 illustrates
the variation of the sulfur concentration against time. Fractional
conversion is evaluated from the following correlation 5  Heterogeneous models for two-phase reactions
can be examined with the experimental data for an explanation of the
process. The model assumed two steps comprising of mass transfer from
gasoline (ext) and adsorption reaction at the gasoline/nanocomposite
interface (ads). According to the additive stage times concept and
considering the necessary corrections for external mass transfer,
the time (t) to achieve a certain degree of conversion
(X) can be found as follows.53 6  where t is the overall adsorption
time, τext and τads are time constants
for external mass transfer and chemisorption of DBT, respectively,
and qfg(X) and qfg(X) are mathematical functions describing
individual conversion steps for spherical nanoparticles53 7   8  All other
combinations, including flat and
cylindrical shapes and mixed kinetic regimes, were mathematically
examined but did not show closer match with the experimental data.
Best-fit examination indicated a total conversion time of τads = 316 min with the possible chemisorption mechanism illustrated
in Figure 11.

Pseudo-first
and pseudo-second-order rate equations were also tested
for best-fit determination54,55 9   10  where k1 (min–1) and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) are the
pseudo-first and second-order rate
constants, respectively. Variations of the left-hand terms of eqs 9 and 10 were plotted against time. From the plots, the rate constants
and the coefficients of determination were obtained by the regression
analysis evaluation (Figure 12). The results are listed in Table 4. The pseudo-first-order model did not show
a straight line for ln(qe – qt) vs t, while the best-fit
result belonged to the pseudo-second-order model (Figure 12). The adsorption capacity
gained from this model was 3.56 (mg g–1), which
was close to the value of 3.37 (mg g–1) obtained
from Figure 5. Thus,
it was concluded that pseudo-second-order surface adsorption controls
the rate of sulfur removal by g-C3N4/SnO2.

Conclusions
The
previously introduced g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite having the BET surface area of 66.36 (m2 g–1) was used as a new sorbent for sulfur
removal from the commercial gasoline samples obtained from a domestic
gas station in Tehran. The experimental results showed the increase
in sulfur removal with the adsorbent dose, consistent with the well-known
Freundlich isotherm equation. Kinetic model calculations showed a
single-step mechanism consisting of a pseudo-second-order chemical
reaction with the rate constant of 0.015 g mg–1 min–1, which explained the chemisorption of sulfur on the
g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite sample.
The nanocomposite loaded with the sulfur was then removed by high-speed
centrifugation. Due to both ease in production and environmentally
friendly process, the
g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite was therefore
found to be a desirable and promising material for petroleum sulfur
elimination applications.

Experimental Methods
Preparation of the Adsorbent
Urea (Merck) as the precursor
of carbon nitride, 37% analytical-grade hydrochloric acid (HCl) (density
of 1.19 g cm–3), and 25% ammonium hydroxide were
all obtained from Merck. Commercially available pure tin, ethanol,
and deionized (DI) water were purchased from a local chemical supplier.
The g-C3N4/SnO2 nanocomposite was
synthesized following the procedure described in a previous paper.36 Microwave and urea were used to save energy
and reduce the adsorbent cost.

It took 3 h to mix and dissolve
0.175 g of tin in 10 mL of hydrochloric acid. The pH of the solution
was adjusted to 12 by adding 300 mL of ammonium hydroxide. One gram
of urea was added, and the beaker was placed in a microwave oven operated
at 2.45 GHz and 630 W for 30 min. The product was then washed with
DI water and ethanol and centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm. The product
was dried at 180 °C for 48 h and calcined at 550 °C for
1 h.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the adsorbents were recorded using a Philips X’Pert Pro MPD
with a Cu Kα radiation source. The BET surface areas of the
adsorbents were measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method (BELSORP MINI II) through N2 adsorption/desorption.
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were
recorded on AVATAR (Thermo). The morphology of the adsorbents was
investigated by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM, Tescan Mira 3-XMU). High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) was performed using a JEM-2100F device equipped
with a Gatan Orius SC1000 CCD camera, and the accelerating voltage
was 80 kV. The sample powder was ultrasonically dispersed in acetone
for approximately 10 min, and the suspensions were deposited on a
carbon-coated copper grid. EDS mapping and EDS spectrum were carried
out in scanning TEM mode using an Oxford XMax-80T EDS detector and
the mentioned FESEM equipped with a SAMX EDS detector, respectively.

Adsorption Process
Gasoline used in the present study
was obtained from a local petrol pump, and its total sulfur was determined
by a HORIBA SLFA-2800 X-ray fluorescence analyzer (71.6 mg S L–1). Gasoline contained 358.51 mg DBT L–1 sulfur-containing DBT (62.38 mg S L–1). Different
amounts of adsorbent’s dosage (0.025–1 g) were mixed
with 10 mL of gasoline in a shaker for 15–360 min at ambient
conditions. Gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID,
Agilent 7890A GC) equipped with a DB-5 column (L =
30 m; id = 0.25 mm) was utilized for detecting the remaining sulfur
concentration in the gasoline. The amount of sulfur compound adsorbed
onto the sorbent (qt, mg g–1) is calculated from 11  where C0 and Ct (mg L–1) are sulfur concentrations
at the beginning and at time t, respectively, V (L) is the volume of the gasoline, and m (g) is the mass of the adsorbent. The removal percentage of the
sulfur can be obtained from 12  After adsorption, the nanocomposite material
containing sulfur species was eliminated from the purified gasoline
by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 rpm.
