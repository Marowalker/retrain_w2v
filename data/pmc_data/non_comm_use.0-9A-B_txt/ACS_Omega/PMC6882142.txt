The conventional definition of asphaltenes
is based on their solubility
in toluene and their insolubility in heptane. We have utilized this
definition to study the influence of partial charge parametrization
on the aggregation behavior of asphaltenes using classical atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations performed on the microsecond time scale.
Under consideration here are toluene- and heptane-based systems with
different partial charges parametrized using the general AMBER force
field (GAFF). Systems with standard GAFF partial charges calculated
by the AM1-BCC and HF/6-31G*(RESP) methods were simulated alongside
systems without partial charges. The partial charges implemented differ
in terms of the resulting electrical negativity of the asphaltene
polyaromatic core, with the AM1-BCC method giving the greatest magnitude
of the total core charge. Based on our analysis of the molecular relaxation
and orientation, and on the aggregation behavior of asphaltenes in
toluene and heptane, we proposed to use the partial charges obtained
by the AM1-BCC method for the study of asphaltene aggregates. A good
agreement with available experimental data was observed on the sizes
of the aggregates, their fractal dimensions, and the solvent entrainment
for the model asphaltenes in toluene and heptane. From the results
obtained, we conclude that for a better predictive ability, simulation
parameters must be carefully chosen, with particular attention paid
to the partial charges owing to their influence on the electrical
negativity of the asphaltene core and on the asphaltenes aggregation.

Introduction
Asphaltenes, the heaviest
and the most polar fractions of oil,
are conventionally defined as a class of compounds that are soluble
in toluene and insoluble in heptane.1 They
present many industrial challenges for oil production, transportation,
and refining.2 Among these challenges are
increases in density and viscosity, stabilization of water–oil
emulsions, clogging of wells and pipelines, and equipment fouling.3 The tendency of asphaltenes to self-assemble
and form aggregates has become the main physical factor underlying
their negative impact.1,4,5 Therefore,
investigating interactions between asphaltenes and their aggregation
behavior at the molecular level is of great importance.

Significant
progress has already been made toward identifying the
driving forces behind asphaltene aggregation. The current assumption
is that the aggregation of asphaltenes is principally governed by
π–π interactions, the interplay between Coulomb
interactions and dominating dispersion forces.6−9 Nevertheless, it remains difficult
to study the aggregation experimentally because of the nanometer scale
of individual asphaltene molecules and even of their aggregates.1 A limited number of reported experimental studies
have focused on aggregation at the nanoscale.5,10−22 Therefore, it has become a promising line of inquiry to utilize
computer simulation methods, such as quantum-chemical calculations,
and classical atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, along with
experimental research, to describe asphaltene aggregation.23

To be predictive, any simulations being
run must capture the relevant
physics and chemistry of asphaltenes. As they are based on the solution
of the Schrödinger equation, quantum-chemical calculations
allow for the most complete description of interactions between asphaltenes.
However, at this level of theory, it becomes quite difficult to study
the aggregation of more than three asphaltene molecules, due to the
computational expense involved. Moreover, asphaltene aggregates usually
include about 3–10 molecules.19,21,24,25 Far fewer physical
details are captured in atomistic and coarse-grained simulations,
since quantum effects and electronic degrees of freedom are omitted.
For such simulations, the main challenges are the time scales and
the description of the interactions between the asphaltenes themselves.23,26 Currently, there is a demand to perform simulations over microseconds
not only to reach an equilibrium state but also to obtain sufficient
statistics.26−28 The interactions in the atomistic and coarse-grained
simulations are taken into account using sets of the potential energy
functions, so-called force fields. Existing force fields provide an
efficient framework to simulate tens or even hundreds of thousands
of atoms over microseconds and to study the aggregation of asphaltenes.23 Recent developments in atomistic simulations
utilizing polarizable force fields may provide the means to accurately
describe the interactions between asphaltenes.29 However, the accuracy and inherent complexity of these
simulations limit their ability to attain the required simulation
time scales because of the increase in the computational power required.30,31 In classical atomistic simulations, the intermolecular contributions
to the system potential energy mainly include the Lennard-Jones and
Coulomb terms.32 The former is defined
by the short-range repulsion and dispersion parts; this is the main
term used to model π–π interactions.33−35 The latter term describes the Coulomb interactions between the atomic
partial charges when, for example, π–π interactions
occur.7,8,33,36 The parametrization of the partial charges is, however,
a highly complex task that can be viewed as a mean to vary the predictive
abilities of simulations.37,38 Usually, the standard
partial charges supplied with the available atomistic force fields
are utilized.23 The use of quantum-chemical
calculations to obtain partial charges is a way to represent the chemical
features of the asphaltenes in the atomistic simulations.23,39,40 The replacement of groups of
asphaltene atoms with “grains” is a way to increase
the available time and length scales in comparison with simulations
based on the atomistic models.41−45 The coarse-graining procedure significantly simplifies the chemistry
of the asphaltenes and their interactions. For example, atomic partial
charges and the Coulomb interactions between them are often omitted
in coarse-grained simulations, while keeping only the Lennard-Jones
contribution to model π–π interactions.41−44 However, taking partial charges into account can be important for
the reproduction of the stacked geometry of asphaltene aggregates,
even at the coarse-grained level.45

Overall, to date, no consensus has been reached on the influence
and role of partial charge parametrization in the aggregation of asphaltenes
in computer simulations. The aim of this study was to address this
issue. To this end, the aggregation behavior of the asphaltenes in
toluene and heptane was analyzed using classical atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations over a time scale of several microseconds. Model
systems with different partial charges were considered using the general
AMBER force field (GAFF).

The rest of the paper is organized
as follows: in the following
section, we will set out our analysis of the mutual arrangement of
asphaltenes, the interactions between asphaltenes, the sizes and the
fractal dimensions of the asphaltene aggregates, and the solvent entrainment
inside the aggregates. We will then summarize our conclusions, and,
finally, we will provide the description of the models studied and
the details of our simulations.

Results and Discussion
Mutual
Arrangement of Asphaltenes
Let us start by analyzing
the mutual arrangement of the asphaltenes in the simulated systems.
To this end, the autocorrelation function Ppair(Δt) of the centers-of-mass distances between
the pairs of asphaltenes was calculated as 1  where d(t) and d(t + Δt) denote the centers-of-mass distances
between two asphaltenes at t and t + Δt simulation
times, respectively; ⟨···⟩t is the averaging over the time intervals and over
all of the asphaltenes in a system; and ⟨d⟩2 and ⟨d2⟩
are the square of the average centers-of-mass distance and the mean-square
center-of-mass distance for the pair of asphaltenes, respectively.

The dependence of the autocorrelation function Ppair(Δt) for the systems under
consideration is presented in Figure 1. Each Ppair(Δt) dependence was calculated using 5 μs long trajectories.

Figure 1 Autocorrelation
function Ppair(Δt) for asphaltenes in toluene- and heptane-based systems
(a) without partial charges, (b) with partial charges calculated by
the HF/6-31G*(RESP) method, and (c) with partial charges calculated
by the AM1-BCC method obtained using 5 μs long simulation trajectories.

As can be seen in Figure 1, the change in the mutual arrangement of
asphaltenes was
characterized by two relaxation processes in all of the systems studied:
fast and slow. The characteristic times of the relaxation processes
observed were evaluated using the sum of two exponentials; see the Supporting Information (Table s2). The fast process can be attributed to the fluctuations
of the asphaltene positions, while the slow process may indicate the
presence of asphaltene aggregation. Notably, the choice of partial
charges significantly influenced the relaxation in toluene and heptane.
In the case of the partial charges calculated by the HF/6-31G*(RESP)
method, the relaxation of the Ppair(Δt) autocorrelation function for the asphaltenes was very
similar in both solvents. In the toluene- and heptane-based systems
without partial charges, the fast processes decayed at different times,
whereas the slow processes appeared to be similar. The use of partial
charges calculated by the AM1-BCC method revealed a drastically different
trend: both relaxation processes were much slower in heptane than
in toluene. This may indicate that asphaltenes aggregate more strongly
in heptane than in toluene. It is worth noting that only the partial
charges obtained using the AM1-BCC method led to a prominent difference
in the relaxation of asphaltenes in toluene and heptane.

The
slow process can take up to ∼250 ns of simulation time,
depending on the partial charges; see Table s2. This estimate showed that on the scale of a few hundred nanoseconds
the asphaltenes lose their correlations (memory). Therefore, to ensure
that equilibration was reached in the systems, the first 300 ns were
defined as the equilibration time. The production run time was deemed
to be more than 4 μs, that is, 1 order of magnitude greater
than the slowest relaxation process in the systems. Thus, we believe
that such long simulations are necessary to carefully equilibrate
the systems and to obtain sufficient statistics.

Interactions
of Asphaltenes
We studied the interactions
of the asphaltenes in toluene and heptane, depending on the choice
of the partial charges. The pair correlation function46g(r) between the asphaltene
centers of masses has been analyzed as 2  where N0 = 50
is the number of asphaltenes in the systems, ⟨ρ⟩
is the asphaltene number density, δ is the Dirac delta function,
and rij is the distance
between the centers of mass of the ith and jth asphaltenes (i ≠ j).

This pair correlation function g(r) describes the local density of asphaltenes and is presented
in Figure 2 for the
systems with different partial charges.

Figure 2 Pair correlation function g(r) between the asphaltene centers of
mass for the toluene- and heptane-based
systems (a) without partial charges, (b) with partial charges calculated
by the HF/6-31G* method, and (c) with partial charges calculated by
the AM1-BCC method.

All g(r) dependences showed strong
maxima at short distances between the asphaltene centers of mass,
for all of the systems examined. This indicates the formation of asphaltene
aggregates. At the same time, the number of maxima and, consequently,
the microstructure of the aggregates were heavily dependent on the
partial charges.

In particular, there were two maxima located
at distances r ∼ 0.35 and 0.5 nm
in the systems without
partial charges, Figure 2a. These maxima may correspond to two possible distances between
the adjacent asphaltene centers of masses with cofacial parallel (face-to-face)
and parallel displaced (offset) stacked geometries in the aggregates,
respectively; see Figure 3a. In the systems with partial charges calculated by the HF/6-31G*(RESP)
method, the polyaromatic core carried the charge of −0.17;
see the Supporting Information. This could
result in a decreased overlap area between the cores.47 Indeed, it turned out that the configuration of the asphaltenes
with cofacial parallel stacked geometry was less preferable than the
parallel displaced stacked geometry, since the maximum at r ∼ 0.35 nm was much lower than the maximum
at r ∼ 0.5 nm; see Figure 2b. When the partial charges calculated by
the AM1-BCC method were used, the adjacent asphaltenes adopted parallel
displaced stacked geometry with r ∼ 0.6 nm;
see Figures 2c and 3b. This result could stem from the fact that the
electrical negativity of the polyaromatic core of the model asphaltenes
having a charge of −0.29 was large enough to prohibit the formation
of cofacial parallel stacked geometry in this case. The maxima at
larger r in Figure 2 can be attributed to the distances between the asphaltenes
separated by one or several molecules in the aggregates and also to
the distances between the asphaltenes in the configuration with T-shaped
(edge-to-face) geometry. Thus, the presence of π–π
interactions between the asphaltenes was established for all sets
of the partial charges, taking into account that the center-of-mass
distances between the asphaltenes were considered in the calculations.48

Figure 3 Aggregation of the asphaltenes with the adjacent asphaltenes
adopting
(a) both cofacial parallel (face-to-face) and parallel displaced (offset)
stacked geometries with r ∼ 0.35 and 0.5 nm,
respectively, and (b) mainly parallel displaced stacked geometry with r ∼ 0.6 nm.

We conclude that the molecular orientation of the asphaltenes in
the aggregates was influenced by the partial charges. The configuration
of the adjacent asphaltenes with parallel displaced stacked geometry
dominated in the asphaltene aggregates, in agreement with both previous
experiments and quantum-chemical calculations.13,49 This was not the case in the systems without partial charges, where
cofacial parallel stacked geometry was found to be the most likely
outcome.

It should also be noted that the values of g(r) in the case of heptane solutions were
always larger than
the corresponding values in the case of toluene solutions, even at
large values of r. It can be assumed that the strength
of the asphaltene interactions and the size of the aggregates were
larger in heptane than in toluene. The highest difference between
the g(r) curves was observed for
the partial charges calculated by the AM1-BCC method, whereas when
the HF/6-31G*(RESP) method was used, the dependences almost coincide.

Overall, the analyses of the mutual arrangement and the interactions
of asphaltenes complemented each other and revealed the necessity
of accounting for the partial charges. Among the partial charges considered,
the set calculated by the AM1-BCC method more accurately reproduced
the relaxation, molecular orientation, and aggregation behavior of
the asphaltenes in toluene and heptane. Therefore, this set was chosen
for the further analysis of the asphaltene aggregates presented below.

Sizes of Asphaltene Aggregates
The average number of
asphaltene molecules in the aggregates, in other words, the aggregation
number, is one of the main characteristics used in both experimental
and theoretical studies to evaluate aggregation behavior of asphaltenes
in various surroundings.14,15,25,26,50

In the present simulations, the aggregation number is estimated
by a neighbor search for asphaltenes using a geometric criterion.
The simplest geometric criterion was used. Any two individual asphaltenes
are neighbors if the nearest distance between their atoms does not
exceed a certain value, the so-called cutoff radius rcut.26 Here, rcut was set at 0.4 nm. Determining the groups of neighboring
asphaltenes allows one to describe their aggregates and, consequently,
the average number of molecules in the aggregates. Note that the individual
asphaltenes, i.e., those without neighbors, are not considered as
aggregates in this analysis.26 The time
dependence of the number-average aggregate sizes of asphaltenes ⟨N⟩(t) in toluene and heptane is
presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Time dependence of the number-average aggregate sizes ⟨N⟩(t) of the asphaltenes in (a)
toluene and (b) heptane in the systems with partial charges calculated
by the AM1-BCC method. The horizontal dotted line shows the total
number N0 = 50 of the asphaltenes in the
systems.

It can be seen in Figure 4a that the time dependence
of the number-average aggregate
sizes of asphaltenes in toluene fluctuated around the average value
of 7 ± 3 molecules. This estimate is in line with a number of
experimental studies.15,17,24 In heptane, large clusters of several aggregates were formed, which
comprised almost all of the asphaltenes in the system and were stable
on time scales on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds (Figure 4b). Large fluctuations were
observed, and the clusters could easily be destroyed by thermal fluctuations.

Important information on the behavior of asphaltenes in toluene
and heptane is contained in the distribution of the probability density
of the aggregate sizes P(N); see Figure 5.

Figure 5 Distribution of the probability
density of the aggregate sizes P(N) for asphaltenes in toluene and heptane.

In the case of toluene, the P(N) distribution decayed rapidly to N ∼ 35
molecules, with dimers constituting the dominant state of aggregation.
This means that the asphaltenes are dissolved and uniformly distributed
in toluene.26 In turn, the distribution
of the aggregate sizes was bimodal in the case of heptane, suggesting
the presence of two main populations of aggregates in the system:
dimers and large clusters of about 40–45 asphaltenes. These
results confirm the strong tendency of asphaltenes to aggregate in
heptane.41

Therefore, analysis of
the evolution of the aggregate sizes and
distribution confirms that the model asphaltenes matched their definition
based on solubility: in toluene, they dissolved, forming small aggregates,
while in heptane, they aggregated.

Fractal Dimension of the
Aggregates
We now turn to
a comparative analysis of the structure of aggregates composed of
a similar number of asphaltenes in toluene and heptane. One of the
characteristics widely used in experiments is the dependence of asphaltene
mass M in the aggregate on its radius of gyration Rg.14,19,22,51 The M(Rg) dependence allows one to study the influence
of the solvent type on the sizes of the aggregates with similar composition,
as well as to define the fractal dimension Df of the aggregates from the scaling dependence M ∼ RgDf; see Figure 6.

Figure 6 Mass M of asphaltene aggregates versus their radius
of gyration Rg in toluene and heptane.
The arrows indicate the scaling dependence M ∼ RgDf, where Df is the fractal dimension of the aggregates calculated as the slope
of the M(Rg) curve.

Figure 6 shows that
the Rg values of the aggregates with similar
masses in heptane were lower than the ones in toluene. Thus, the sizes
of aggregates were influenced by the solvent type. Given a similar
number of asphaltenes, the aggregates were more compact in heptane
than in toluene.

It can also be seen that the fractal dimension
of the aggregates
was equal to 2 in the case of toluene solution, M ∼ Rg2. The result obtained is in an excellent
agreement with the known experimental studies for asphaltene aggregates
in toluene, where Df = 1.7–2.1
was reported.14,19,22 Physically, this fractal dimension indicates that the structure
of the asphaltene aggregates in toluene is spherical with high porosity
or planar.51 The M(Rg) dependence in the case of heptane had a more
complex shape as compared to that for toluene. Two regions with different
slopes, at small and at large Rg values,
were observed. As in the case of toluene, the fractal dimension of
the aggregates was equal to 2 at small Rg below 2 nm, with the dependence showing a kink at Rg ≈ 2 nm. The number N of asphaltenes
forming the aggregate of such a size was about 15, while M
≈ 104 g/mol. At large Rg above 2 nm, the fractal dimension approached 3. A similar Df value was experimentally obtained for the
asphaltenes in heptane.51 According to
ref (14), this result
means that the model asphaltenes are insoluble in heptane. Moreover,
the data obtained for the large aggregates suggested that the aggregates
in heptane are rather compact and almost spherical in shape.

Therefore, the simulations reproduced not only the experimental
trends of asphaltene aggregation in toluene and heptane but also the
fractal dimension of the aggregates.

Solvent Entrainment inside
the Aggregates
To provide
a comparison with experiments, the volume fraction of the solvent
inside the asphaltene aggregates was estimated. Schematically, the
calculations are shown in Figure 7. First, an aggregate to analyze was selected, followed
by building its “convex shell”, searching for the solvent
molecules inside the “convex shell”, and, finally, evaluation
of the volume fraction of solvent inside the aggregate. “Convex
shell” can be viewed as a set of triangles that are built to
surround all of the asphaltene atoms within the aggregate, the vertices
of these triangles being the atoms of the aggregate surface. Qhull
library52 was used to build the “convex
shells” of the asphaltene aggregates based on the atom coordinate
files in the systems simulated.

aggregates. (a) Instant configuration of the selected asphaltene aggregate.

is colored in blue, the “convex shell” is red, and the
solvent is green. (d) Instant configuration of the selected asphaltene
aggregate (blue) together with solvent molecules (red) inside the

The dependence of the solvent volume fraction fv inside the aggregates on the number N of
asphaltenes in their composition, both for toluene and heptane
solutions, is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Number N of asphaltenes versus the volume fraction fv of toluene and heptane inside the aggregates.
The area colored in gray indicates the experimental range of toluene
entrainment inside the aggregates reported by Gawrys et al.18

It was established that
the volume fraction of the solvent inside
the aggregates with the same number of asphaltenes in heptane is lower
than in toluene; see Figure 8. The data obtained are in line with the analysis of the aggregate
sizes discussed above. For the aggregates consisting of 20–35
molecules (Rg ∼ 2.6–3.3
nm) in toluene, a comparison with experimental data can be made. To
the best of our knowledge, the reported fraction of toluene in large
(2.5–8 nm) asphaltene aggregates lies in the range from 30
to 50 vol % in the samples at 1 wt % asphaltenes.18 These data are in a good agreement with our results obtained
at 10 wt % asphaltenes. At the same time, the fraction of heptane
in the asphaltene aggregates turned out to be readily observable.

Thus, the asphaltene aggregates contained a significant amount
of the solvent. This result may stem from the fact that the aggregates
and their surfaces have a rather complex shape and thereby they are
filled by the solvent molecules.

Conclusions
The
influence of partial charge parametrization on the aggregation
behavior of asphaltenes was studied using microsecond-long atomistically
detailed classical molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, the
asphaltenes in toluene and heptane solutions were considered according
to their solubility-based definition, using the reliable and widely
utilized GAFF force field together with different atomic partial charges.
The standard sets of GAFF partial charges were calculated by the AM1-BCC
and HF/6-31G*(RESP) methods and implemented in the simulated models.
It was found that the two sets of partial charges result in different
electrical negativities of the polyaromatic core of the model asphaltenes.
The AM1-BCC method led to a more negative polyaromatic core than the
HF/6-31G*(RESP) method. Systems without partial charges were simulated
as well.

The mutual arrangement of the asphaltenes and the interactions
between them were analyzed, and a significant influence of the partial
charge parametrization on the relaxation, the molecular orientation,
and the aggregation behavior of the asphaltenes was established. In
the case of the partial charges calculated by the AM1-BCC method,
it was shown that the relaxation of asphaltene aggregates is much
slower in heptane than in toluene. In turn, the adjacent asphaltenes
in the aggregates mainly adopted a parallel displaced stacked geometry.
The strength of the asphaltene interactions and the size of the aggregates
were greater in heptane than in toluene. By contrast, the other set
of partial charges failed to reproduce these characteristics in toluene
and heptane, possibly due to the insufficient electrical negativity
of the polyaromatic core of the model asphaltenes. Thus, we found
that the set of partial charges obtained by the AM1-BCC method is
more promising, and this set was selected for all subsequent simulations.

The simulated systems were checked against experimental data on
asphaltene aggregation behavior in toluene and heptane, the fractal
dimension, and the solvent entrainment of the asphaltene aggregates.
In particular, the asphaltenes in toluene mainly formed small aggregates
composed of only a few molecules, while a strong tendency toward aggregation
was observed for the asphaltenes in heptane. Thus, the validity of
the solubility-based definition of the asphaltenes was confirmed.
The sizes of the aggregates with the same number of asphaltenes were
lower in heptane than in toluene. Moreover, the fractal dimension
of the large aggregates Df = 2
suggested the formation of planar or spherical porous structures in
toluene. The large aggregates having the radius of gyration greater
than 2 nm formed rather compact spherical structures in heptane, since
their fractal dimension was close to Df = 3. It was also established that the volume fraction of the solvent
inside the aggregates consisting of a similar number of asphaltene
molecules in heptane is lower than in toluene. Overall, a good agreement
was found between the simulation results and the experimental data.

To summarize, we considered a number of experimentally valuable
characteristics of asphaltenes in toluene and heptane. We conclude
that the choice of partial charges may have a significant impact on
the electrical negativity of the asphaltene core and the aggregation
behavior of the asphaltenes in toluene and heptane. The GAFF force
field together with the partial charges calculated by the AM1-BCC
method could be successfully used to study the nanoscale structure
of asphaltenes in toluene and heptane.

Model and Computational
Methods
Asphaltenes naturally occur in the environment as
a mixture of
molecules, and thousands of different chemical structures of asphaltenes
can potentially exist.3 This is the reason
why solubility in toluene and heptane, rather than a specific chemical
structure, is the basis for their definition. An important step in
the simulations of asphaltenes is the choice of their model mixture
and chemical structure. The choice of the mixture of asphaltenes can
never be universal, given that only a limited number of different
molecules can be examined in the simulations.26 Moreover, taking different molecules into account can significantly
increase the computational resources required for the simulations.53 Nevertheless, the definition of asphaltenes
assumes that a monodispersed sample can represent the solubility of
the asphaltenes in toluene and heptane.26 Such an assumption is common in simulational research.23 Therefore, a monodispersed sample of asphaltenes
was considered in this study.

In terms of their structure, asphaltenes
are complex polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the most common characteristics of
the behavior of asphaltenes in toluene and heptane can be investigated
using a model molecule with a “typical” chemical structure.26 Therefore, following the studies of Mullins1 and Li and Greenfield,54 we considered an asphaltene molecule with the “typical”
chemical structure shown in Figure 9, which has been successfully used in the past to describe
the structure of asphalt55−57 and the water–oil interface.58 This asphaltene model has a molecular weight
of 707.1 g/mol. It contains seven aromatic rings, several long and
short linear aliphatic side groups, and one sulfur heteroatom in the
polyaromatic core of the molecule. It should be pointed out that none
of the previous studies checked whether the model molecule can be
considered as an asphaltene based on its solubility as the main definition;
this check is performed in the simulations reported in this paper.

this study; see refs (1, 54−58).

The interactions in the simulated
systems studied were described
using the GAFF force field.59 This force
field has been found to be reliable in simulations of both asphaltenes39,40,60 and polyaromatic compounds.61 The simulation input files, containing information
on the atom parameters, as well as the bonded and Lennard-Jones interactions
between the atoms, were generated using the ACPYPE tool, as recommended
by the GAFF developers.59,62 It is also recommended
to use atomic partial charges calculated by the AM1-BCC or HF/6-31G*(RESP)
methods to account for the Coulomb interactions in GAFF.32,59 Therefore, in the present simulations, both standard sets of atomic
partial charges were utilized to analyze the influence of their parametrization
on the asphaltene aggregation behavior. The ACPYPE tool was used to
perform calculations by the AM1-BCC method. Another set of partial
charges was calculated by the HF/6-31G*(RESP) method with the aid
of the Gaussian 09 software.63 The calculated
sets of partial charges can be found in Table S1 reported in the Supporting Information. It should be mentioned that the two sets of partial charges are
quite different: when calculating the total charge of the polyaromatic
core of the model asphaltene molecule, we found that the AM1-BCC and
HF/6-31G*(RESP) methods gave charges of −0.29 and −0.17,
respectively. Thus, the former method resulted in an electrically
more negative polyaromatic core in comparison with the latter. Therefore,
it is reasonable to analyze which set of partial charges would allow
us to reproduce the aggregation behavior of asphaltenes. Additionally,
systems without partial charges were also considered for comparison,
i.e., zero partial charges were used.

The main goal of the present
simulations is twofold: (i) to choose
the most promising atomic partial charges on the basis of the solubility
of the model asphaltenes in toluene and heptane by studying their
aggregation behavior; (ii) to address the experimentally valuable
characteristics of the asphaltenes in toluene and heptane, such as
their sizes, fractal dimensions, and solvent entrainment in the asphaltene
aggregates. Therefore, two types of solutions were considered, and
a total of six systems were studied, which differed in terms of partial
charges and solvent type. Analysis of the simulation approaches of
asphaltenes in toluene and heptane using atomistic molecular dynamics
allowed us to adapt the existing protocols; see the review in ref (23). At the first stage, a simulation cell containing
the number N0 = 50 of asphaltenes was
generated. For this purpose, the asphaltenes and the solvent molecules
were randomly added into the periodic cubic cell. An example of the
configuration obtained for the heptane-based system filled with asphaltenes
is presented in Figure 10. The asphaltenes were simulated at the concentration of 10
wt % corresponding to their usual concentration in oil.3,64 Accordingly, the system contained 3453 toluene or 3175 heptane molecules.
To reach experimental densities, the obtained cells were compressed
for 5 ns at a temperature of 300 K and at a pressure of 150 bar.

Figure 10 Snapshot
of the instant configuration of the system composed of
asphaltenes after the addition of the heptane molecules. For visual
clarity, lines have been used to draw heptane molecules, while the
atoms inside the asphaltene molecules are depicted by spheres. The
blue lines indicate the simulation cell.

After the compression stage, systems with various sets of atomic
partial charges were simulated at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure
of 1 bar. Time scales on the order of 100 ns are the state of the
art for atomistic simulations.23 However,
the displacement of asphaltenes to a distance comparable with their
size can take hundreds of nanoseconds,65 suggesting that a lower estimate for the equilibration times is
required. It is therefore important to describe the aggregation behavior
of asphaltenes on the microsecond time scale. Thus, the simulation
was run for 5 μs for each system. The total time of the simulations
performed in this study was 30 μs.

The Gromacs 5.1.4 package
was used to perform the molecular dynamics
simulations.66 The equations of motion
were integrated with the time step of 2 fs. Temperature and pressure
were coupled using the Nosé–Hoover and Parrinello–Rahman
algorithms, with time constants of 0.4 and 1 ps, respectively.67−69 The nonbonded interactions were truncated at 1 nm, similar to that
in ref (70). The particle
mesh Ewald algorithm was used to deal with the electrostatic interactions
in the systems with partial charges.71 The
simulations were analyzed using Python scripts powered by the MDAnalysis
library,72,73 while the VMD software74 was utilized for the visualization of the trajectories.
