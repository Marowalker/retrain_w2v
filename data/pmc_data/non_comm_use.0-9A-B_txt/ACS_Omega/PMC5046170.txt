We describe a new
method for the detection of miRNA in biological
samples. This technology is based on the isothermal nicking enzyme
amplification reaction and subsequent hybridization of the amplification
product with gold nanoparticles and magnetic microparticles (barcode
system) to achieve naked-eye colorimetric detection. This platform
was used to detect a specific miRNA (miRNA-10b) associated with breast
cancer, and attomolar sensitivity was demonstrated. The assay was
validated in cell culture lysates from breast cancer cells and in
serum from a mouse model of breast cancer.

==== Body
Introduction
Micro RNAs (miRNAs)
are small noncoding single-stranded RNA molecules,
typically 21–25 nucleotides in length, that regulate gene expression.1 The first miRNA was discovered in 1993 in Caenorhabditis elegans by Lee et al.2 Since this discovery, miRNAs have been shown to be naturally
abundant and evolutionarily conserved in both plants and animals.3a−3c In fact, bioinformatic studies predict that the human genome may
contain up to 1000 miRNAs, of which 706 have already been identified.
Accordingly, it is estimated that miRNA sequences, which are spread
throughout the genome, account for 2–5% of human genes.4 The function of miRNAs is to downregulate gene
expression by binding to the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs)
of target mRNAs.5a,5b miRNA expression profiles exhibit
unique temporal and spatial patterns that are specific for developmental
stages and tissue types.6a,6b The expression of miRNAs
is determined by both intrinsic cellular factors and diverse environmental
variables.1,7a,7b Notably, it
is estimated that miRNAs regulate 10–30% of all protein-coding
genes.8 In humans, miRNAs typically exert
their effect by binding to imperfect complementary sites within the
3′UTRs of their target protein-coding mRNAs, thereby hindering
translation.9,10 Therefore, miRNAs can reduce
the protein levels of their target genes without affecting the mRNA
levels. On the contrary, in plants, miRNAs bind to protein-coding
mRNA sequences that are exactly complementary to the miRNA, consequently
inducing the RNA-mediated interference pathway, leading to cleavage
of mRNA by Argonaute in the RNA-induced silencing complex.11a,11b

Several studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are important
regulators
of a variety of fundamental biological processes, such as embryonic
development,12 cell proliferation,13 cell death,13,14 fat metabolism,15 hematopoiesis,16a,16b stress resistance,17a,17b neuronal development,18 and tumorigenesis.13,19 Furthermore, accumulating evidence demonstrates a crucial role of
miRNAs in cancer and other diseases.20a−20c In contrast to the
tightly regulated patterns of miRNA expression during development
and in normal tissues, miRNAs are often misregulated under pathological
conditions. For example, miRNAs that are overexpressed in cancer usually
function as oncogenes, whereas miRNAs with tumor-suppressing activity
are frequently downregulated.21a,21b Some studies provide
functional evidence that overexpression of a specific miRNA, miRNA-10b,
can contribute to the development of breast cancer metastasis.22

Traditional methods for detecting miRNAs
are northern blotting,
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and microarrays.23 However, all of these methods display some limitations.
For instance, northern blotting is a long and complex procedure that
requires radiolabeling and usually has a low detection limit, whereas
RT-PCR and microarrays have good sensitivity but require costly instrumentation.
Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and low-cost
miRNA detection methods. The rapid development of nanotechnology has
resulted in new tools for DNA24 and miRNA
detection, including nanoparticle-derived probes,25a−25c electrochemical methods,26a−26c and DNAzyme-based reporters.27a−27e Such newly developed methods combine an isothermal amplification
step with a signal output component to achieve a high detection efficiency.28a−28c

Nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) is a commonly
used
method for isothermal amplification of miRNA.27a,29 This technique exploits DNA polymerase and a nicking enzyme to rapidly
generate and release a desired sequence, obtaining an amplification
efficiency comparable to that of PCR.30 Notably, NEAR is especially suitable for the development of portable
devices for point-of-care (POC) testing, as it can proceed at a constant
temperature and does not require specialized instrumentation. In this
study, NEAR was combined with a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)/magnetic
microparticle (MMP) system to obtain highly sensitive colorimetric
miRNA detection in biological samples.

The miRNA detection process
used in this study is illustrated in Figure 1. In the first step
of the process, a DNA probe hybridizes with the target miRNA, and
brief RNase digestion is carried out to reduce unspecific interference.
Subsequently, polymerization is initiated by the addition of a DNA
polymerase. This latter enzyme recognizes the 3′-OH end of
miRNA and extends it using the adjacent sequence as a template. Polymerization
introduces a nicking enzyme recognition site, which is readily cleaved
by an endonuclease. Cleavage of the single strand generates a new
3′-OH group for subsequent initiation of strand extension.
A short single-stranded DNA sequence is released during polymerization.
This process of strand extension, cleavage, and displacement is repeated
for many cycles, thereby producing a large quantity of short DNA strands
(linker DNA). In the second step of the process, the linker DNA is
hybridized with complementary oligonucleotides immobilized on AuNPs
and MMPs. Magnetic washing is used to separate the unattached AuNPs
from the MMPs. AuNPs attached to the surface of MMPs serve as a colorimetric
marker for miRNA. Indeed, AuNPs are superior for colorimetric assays,
as they possess extinction coefficients that are several orders of
magnitude higher than those of traditional chromophores.31

Figure 1 miRNA detection process. (A) Schematic illustration of
the steps
required for colorimetric detection of miRNA. In step A, the probe
binds to the target miRNA and DNA polymerase extends the strand, displacing
the linker. Polymerization introduces a nicking enzyme recognition
site. Subsequently, enzymatic cleavage generates another linker and
3′-OH end that can be used for further polymerization. Strand
displacement amplification produces single-stranded DNA products (linker)
that trigger step B. In step B, the linker is used to attach AuNPs
to MMPs. Half of the linker sequence is complementary to the oligonucleotides
immobilized on AuNPs, whereas the other half is complementary to the
oligonucleotides immobilized on MMPs. A red-colored solution after
magnetic retrieval of the MMPs indicates binding of AuNPs and the
presence of target miRNA in the sample. (B) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) of strand displacement amplification components. First lane,
target miRNA; second lane, probe; third lane, negative control (reaction
performed without target); fourth lane, linker (reaction performed
with 100 nM of target miRNA).

Therefore, the proposed assay is based
on isothermal amplification and a barcode system composed of MMPs
conjugated with AuNPs by hybridization of a universal linker sequence,
namely, a linker with a fixed sequence, independent of the target
miRNA. This allows the development of multiplexed assays, as the probe
sequence is the only assay component that is target-specific.

Experimental
Section
AuNP Functionalization with Thiolated DNA Oligonucleotides
AuNPs conjugated with DNA oligonucleotides were prepared as previously
described.32 Briefly, thiolated DNA oligonucleotides
were digested with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (10 mM) for 3 h at
room temperature. The digested oligonucleotides were then incubated
with AuNPs (2000:1 molar ratio) overnight at room temperature in an
electric shaker (400 rpm). A solution of NaCl (0.3 M) in phosphate
buffer (10 mM; pH 7.4) with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; 0.01%) was
added stepwise to the AuNP–DNA mixture over the course of 8
h. After additional overnight incubation at room temperature, the
DNA-conjugated AuNPs were centrifuged (17 300g, 15 min) and washed with NaCl (0.3 M) in phosphate buffer (10 mM)
with SDS (0.01%) to remove excess unbound DNA. The probes were stored
at 4 °C until use. To determine the density of DNA probes on
the nanoparticle surface, DNA-conjugated AuNPs (10 μL) were
digested overnight with dithiolthreitol (1 mM) in phosphate buffer
(90 mM, pH 8) at 40 °C. The mixture was centrifuged (17 300g, 15 min), and the amount of oligonucleotides in the supernatant
was estimated using the Quant-iT OliGreen ssDNA kit (Invitrogen).
The concentration of AuNPs was measured by UV–vis spectroscopy
and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).
On average, 540 copies of DNA oligonucleotides were linked to each
nanoparticle. The size and zeta potential of pre- and post-functionalized
AuNPs were measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern).

ICP-AES
AuNPs (10 μL) were added to aqua regia
solution (500 μL), and the mixture was incubated overnight at
room temperature. After digestion, the total volume was brought to
5 mL and the samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies 700
series ICP-AES instrument. A wide calibration curve (0–3 mg/mL)
for Au3+ ions was obtained, with three absorbance peaks
(λAu = 242.794, 267.594, and 208.207 nm; λAr = 737.212 nm).

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Gel
electrophoresis was
carried out on agarose gels (0.7%), using sodium boric acid buffer
(pH 8.5), for 80 min at 70 V. AuNP samples (10 μL; 1.17 ×
1012 particles/mL) containing glycerol (25%) were loaded
into each well. A band with clearly reduced electrophoretic mobility
was observed for the DNA–AuNP probes (Figure S1) compared with the AuNPs without immobilized oligonucleotides,
confirming successful oligonucleotide conjugation (Figure S2A).

Preparation of MMPs Conjugated with DNA Oligonucleotides
The biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide stock was conjugated to streptavidin-coated
MMPs following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the
MMPs (10 mg/mL) were washed three times in RNase-free hybridization
buffer (HB; 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4 and 0.1% Tween 20) to remove
the preservative storage buffer. Next, they were suspended in RNase-free
buffer and incubated at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL with a 2
mM solution of oligonucleotides for 30 min at room temperature.

Finally, the obtained MMP–DNA oligonucleotide complex was
washed three times with RNase-free buffer to remove the unbound DNA
strands. To confirm successful conjugation of the oligonucleotides
on the MMP surface, the MMP–DNA oligonucleotide complex was
further characterized with a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern) (Figure S2B). The binding capacity of the MMPs
was estimated through DNA quantification using a Quant-iT OliGreen
ssDNA kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, the immobilized DNA molecules were
released from the MMPs following the manufacturer’s instructions
(2 min at 90 °C in 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.2, with 95% formamide) and
quantified through fluorescence measurements after MMP removal.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The sample solution
(10 μL) was deposited onto a copper grid for 10 min, after which
the excess solution was removed with a filter paper. Imaging was performed
using a JEOL 1200 microscope (TEM, JEOL; Peabody) operated at an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV (Figures S1A,B and S4).

Probe Preparation
The miRNA probe was prepared by mixing
sequences 1 and 2 at a final ratio of 1:0.95 (stock concentration
1 μM) in a total volume of 100 μL. The mixture was heated
at 95 °C for 10 min and slowly cooled to 4 °C (0.1 °C/s).

RNase Protection Assay
An RNase protection assay was
performed by incubating the probe (10 μL) in a stock solution
with 100 nM miRNA in 1× NEB buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH
7.9; 100 mM KCl; 10 mM MgCl2; and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum
albumin) at 37 °C (15 min). RNase was inactivated through heating
at 70 °C for 15 min.

NEAR
All of the amplification conditions,
such as the
nicking enzyme and DNA polymerase concentrations, were optimized,
starting from a previously published protocol.27a The final miRNA probe mixture (50 μL, 200 nM probe)
was incubated at 37 °C (30 min) with Klenow exopolymerase (0.25
units/μL; Bsm DNA polymerase), nicking enzyme (0.125 units/μL;
Nb.Bpu 10I), and dNTP mix (200 μM) in 1× NEB buffer (10
mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.9; 100 mM KCl; 10 mM MgCl2; and
0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin).

Native PAGE
Polyacrylamide
gels were prepared, containing
a 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide mix (19:1; Bio-Rad) in 1× Tris/borate/EDTA
(TBE) (Sigma-Aldrich). The amplified samples (5 μL) were loaded
onto the gels with a 1× DNA gel loading dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and the gels were run in 1× TBE at 90 V for 3 h. The gels were
then stained with GelRed (Biotium) for 15 min, and images were acquired
with a gel doc system (Bio-Rad). To confirm the size of the DNA bands,
a synthetic single-strand DNA oligonucleotide marker was used.

Hybridization
and Colorimetric Detection of miRNA
The
isothermal amplification product (10 μL) was incubated with
oligonucleotide–MMPs (4 μL, 10 min, room temperature).
Subsequently, oligonucleotide–AuNPs (10 μL, 1.7 ×
1012 particles/mL) were added to the solution (30 min,
room temperature). The mixture was then washed two times with HB and
once with 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20 buffer.
Quantification was performed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The sequences of all probes and miRNAs used in this study are reported
in Table 1.

is underlined. Single-base mutations are shown in red.

Cell Culture
MDA-MB-231 and 4T1
cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). The cells
were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with high
glucose (Corning Cellgro), supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%,
Atlas Biological, Fort Collins, CO) and penicillin/streptomycin solution
(1%; Sigma-Aldrich). MCF10A cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas,
VA) and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% of horse serum (Atlas
Biological, Fort Collins, CO), 1% of penicllin/streptomycin solution,
20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/mL insulin
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 250 μL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich).

Extraction of small RNAs (sRNAs) from the cell culture lysates was
performed with the miRVANA isolation kit (Ambiogen). The concentration
and purity of the extracted RNA were measured using a UV spectrophotometer.
The assay was performed with 1 or 10 μL of extracted sRNA from
4T1 cell culture lysates and with 10 μL of extracted sRNA from
MDA-MB-231 cell culture lysates. The sRNA was incubated with the miRNA
probe and 1.25 U/μL RNase to avoid interferences from unspecific
miRNA present in the sample. For qRT-PCR, 1 or 10 μL of extracted
sRNA from 4T1 cell culture lysates and 10 μL of extracted sRNA
from MDA-MB-231 cell culture lysates were analyzed using the Advanced
TaqMan miRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PCR was performed in duplicates for 40 cycles using
an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).
Subsequently, the quantity of miRNA-10b was determined by relative
quantification using miRNA-16 as a reference.

Mouse Breast Cancer Model
Animal studies were performed
following a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
at the Houston Methodist Research Institute and in adherence to the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. Female athymic nude mice (6–8 weeks of age) were acquired
from Charles River. MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended in 50% phosphate-buffered
saline/matrigel solution and injected into the mammary fat pad of
mice (3 million cells/mouse). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture
2, 3, or 4 weeks after tumor cell inoculation. The blood was kept
at room temperature for 30 min, after which it was centrifuged (1500g, 10 min), and the serum was collected and stored at −80
°C until use. sRNAs were extracted from 350 μL of serum
and processed as described in the Cell Culture section. For Advanced TaqMan miRNA assays, 1 μL of RNA was
reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan Advanced miRNA cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the company’s guidelines.

Limit of Detection (LoD)
The LoD was estimated in accordance
with the standard International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry
definition (doi:10.1351/goldbook. L03540) as 10 times the standard
deviation of the blank signal (five independent measurements).

Results
and Discussion
In this study, the AuNP/MMP colorimetric method
was used to detect
miRNA-10b. A probe was designed, containing the following three components:
(1) a sequence complementary to miRNA-10b, (2) a recognition site
for a nicking enzyme, and (3) a linker sequence. PAGE was initially
carried out to confirm that the designed NEAR reaction can successfully
be completed within 30 min at 37 °C. Indeed, a band corresponding
to the size of the linker DNA can be detected in the gel (Figure 1B).

The AuNPs
used in the assay were synthesized as previously described.33a−33c The size and morphology of the AuNPs pre and post functionalization
were assessed by TEM (Figure S1A,B), dynamic
light scattering (Figure S1C), and UV–vis
spectroscopy (Figure S1D). The nanoparticles
had a uniform size distribution, with an average diameter of ∼40
nm. Successful conjugation of thiolated oligonucleotides was confirmed
by an agarose gel retardation assay (Figure S2A).

After NEAR optimization (Figure S3),
the detection limit of the colorimetric assay was determined using
various concentrations of miR-10b (100 aM–100 fM) (Figure 2). Notably, quantification
of miRNA using conventional methods is usually challenging because
of its small size (17–25 nucleotides) and low concentration
(usually <pM) in biological samples. In this study, the colorimetric
assay was able to detect miRNA at concentrations as low as 100 aM
(Figure 2), and a linear
correlation was obtained between absorbance response and miRNA target
concentration in the range from 100 aM to 100 fM (Figure 2). Noticeably, color changes
could clearly be observed with the naked eye after a few minutes at
room temperature (due to target-induced capturing of the AuNP probes,
see also Figure S4).

Figure 2 Colorimetric detection

(100 aM–100 fM). Calibration curve of UV–vis absorbance
(λ = 540 nm) at different miRNA-10b concentrations. The solid
line indicates a logarithmic correlation, where absorbance A = 0.0218 ln(miRNA concentration) + 0.1114 (R2 0.969). Data are presented as mean ± SD of triplicates.

Moreover, the sequence specificity
of the proposed system was evaluated
using miR-10b with artificially introduced mutations. It is important
to be able to distinguish miRNAs that differ in a few nucleotides,
as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequently occurring
variations that may lead to unique traits and disease phenotypes.34a−34c
In particular, as miRNAs can regulate hundreds of genes, SNPs can
have drastic consequences on cell functions and physiological processes.35a,35b The existence of miRNA SNPs poses a great challenge for high-specificity
detection. The results in Figure 3 clearly suggest that this assay is capable of discriminating
specific targets from mismatched strands. The signal of the complementary
target was approximately 3.4- and 4.4-fold higher than that of the
single-base mismatched strand and two-base mismatched strand, respectively.
It is worth noting that sequence specificity was seen despite the
use of unnaturally high concentrations of mutated miRNA. In addition,
to confirm the specificity of our assay in biological samples, we
detected synthetic miRNA-10b (100 fM) after mixing with total sRNA
extracted from MCF10A cells, which lack miRNA-10b. As shown in Figure S5, the interference associated with nontarget
miRNA is very low, demonstrating the high specificity of our method
also under complex experimental conditions, in which similar interfering
sequences are present. The observed specificity suggests that this
assay could potentially be used for the analysis of miRNA SNPs.

and miRNA-10b with two mutations. Absorbance of miRNA-10b at a concentration

Data are presented as mean ± SD of triplicates.

Furthermore, the assay was applied successfully
for the detection
of miRNA in biological samples, indicating its practicality for bioanalysis.
Specifically, cell culture lysates from breast cancer cells and serum
collected from a mouse model of breast cancer were analyzed. MDA-MB-231
human breast cancer cells and 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were used
in this study, as they have previously been reported to express high
levels of miRNA-10b.35Figure 4 shows that miRNA-10b can be
detected in both 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. The performance of
the colorimetric assay was compared to that of RT-PCR analysis, a
gold standard technique for miRNA detection, finding good agreement
(Table 2).

Next,
serum samples were collected from mice bearing orthotopic
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumors. Specifically, blood was collected
2, 3, or 4 weeks after tumor inoculation. Detection of miRNAs in blood
samples can be used for cancer diagnosis, as tumor-derived miRNAs
frequently reach the circulation.36 The
results demonstrated that the signal from control serum (tumor-free
mouse) was similar to that from the background buffer, whereas the
levels of miRNA-10b were substantially increased in tumor-bearing
mice (Figure 5). In
particular, miRNA-10b could be detected in the blood as early as 2
weeks after cancer cell inoculation, and the levels were relatively
constant in mice assayed 3 and 4 weeks after inoculation. The levels
of miRNA-16 were also measured in the samples to ensure that the presence
of tumors did not cause a general increase in the serum levels of
miRNAs (Table 2).39 The results obtained from the colorimetric assay
reflected the relative quantification achieved with RT-qPCR (Table 2). Although miRNA-10b
did not allow the differentiation of tumor stages, as its serum level
does not directly correlate with tumor size,37a,37b the colorimetric detection of its upregulation is indeed of diagnostic
interest, as it enables early cancer detection, even before the tumor
becomes palpable or visible. In essence, the proposed assay can be
used for rapid quantitative isothermal detection of miRNA over a wide
range of concentrations that are clinically relevant.38

breast cancer tumors. The x axis represents weeks
after tumor inoculation. A non-tumor-bearing mouse was used as a control.
The blank value was subtracted from the absorbance results. Data are
presented as mean ± SD of triplicates.

This NEAR-based colorimetric assay exhibits a higher clinical
sensitivity
and specificity than those of previously proposed isothermal amplification-based
strategies.27a,40a,40b Our system provides three distinct advantages. First, the readout
of the assay is based on a clear color change, which can be observed
by the naked eye, avoiding the use of expensive facilities and skilled
labor. Second, the assay results can be obtained by simply mixing
the assay components together, so no complicated operations are needed.
Third, we successfully tested the colorimetric assay with biological
samples (cellular extracts and mouse serum), achieving a highly sensitive,
specific, and semiquantitative detection of miRNA-10b. Assays with
low-cost and simple operation and readout are equally critical for
managing human health, especially in resource-poor areas. Our colorimetric
assay showed interesting potential in POC applications.

Conclusions
In summary, this study describes the development of a colorimetric
isothermal NEAR assay for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of miRNA.
The results reveal that the assay is capable of detecting aM levels
of miRNA in biological samples without the use of conventional methods.
The performance of this AuNP/MMP-based assay was assessed using various
concentrations of miRNA-10b, and sequence sensitivity was evaluated
using single-base-mismatched sequences. Moreover, the ability of the
colorimetric assay to quantify miRNA levels in cell culture lysates
from breast cancer cells and in serum samples from tumor-bearing mice
was similar to that of RT-qPCR. Accordingly, this platform is a promising
analytical tool for the detection and quantification of miRNAs in
biological samples without the use of expensive and complex equipment.
