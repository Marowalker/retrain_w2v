Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525
can produce butanol, 1,3-propanediol, and ethanol from glycerol. The
product distribution can be tilted toward butanol when adding butyric
acid. The strain predominantly produces acetic and butyric acids when
grown on saccharides. Hence, butyrate formed from saccharide conversion
can be used to stimulate butanol production from glycerol under cosubstrate
cultivation. The optimal cosubstrate ratio was determined, and under
optimal conditions, a butanol yield and a productivity of 0.27 ±
0.01 gbutanol g–1(glycerol + sugar)–1 and 0.74 ± 0.02 g L–1 h–1 were obtained. On the basis of these results,
batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor was performed using Jerusalem
artichoke hydrolysate (carbohydrate source) and crude glycerol (residue
from biodiesel production) at the previously determined optimal condition.
A butanol yield and a productivity of 0.28 ± 0.007 gbutanol g(glycerol+sugar)–1 and 0.55 ±
0.008 g L–1 h–1 were achieved
after 27 h fermentation, indicating the suitability of those low-cost
carbon sources as cosubstrates for butanol production via C. pasteurianum.

Introduction
Butanol is a potential advanced biofuel
that can be blent with
gasoline and diesel.1−4 Because of increased substrate costs and availability of less expensive
petrochemically derived butanol in the 1950s, most of the acetone/butanol/ethanol
(ABE) fermentation plants were closed.4,5 However, in
the past decade, the interest in butanol fermentation has been revived,
which led multiple studies on strain development, fermentation improvement,
and in situ product removal technologies.6−9 This has resulted in a major reduction
of product toxicity to the respective microorganisms, improved substrate
utilization, as well as the overall performance of the bioreactors.
Nevertheless, the high cost and seasonal availability of conventional
substrates (corn, molasses) are still a disadvantage for fermentative
butanol processes compared to petroleum-based production.4,7 In order to realize industrial-scale butanol fermentation, it is
crucially important to identify available low-cost biomass feedstock
that is fermentable by Clostridium species.8,10−14 Glycerol is a byproduct generated during biodiesel
production. It is a potential substrate for bio-based production of
chemicals and fuels, leading to multiple recent studies.15−19 As a result of global increase in biodiesel production, surplus
quantities of biodiesel-derived glycerol (crude glycerol) are becoming
available.16 Crude glycerol is contaminated
with various impurities, which makes it unsuitable for conventional
outlets (cosmetics, soaps). Further purification is possible, though
the high cost is rendering it less attractive after significant decrease
of glycerol’s market price.20,21 Hence, effective
utilization of crude glycerol is crucial to enhance the economy of
biodiesel industry.20

The most studied
microorganism for butanol production from glycerol
is Clostridium pasteurianum. It can
utilize glycerol as a sole carbon source and converts it into 1,3-propanediol
(1,3-PDO), butanol, and ethanol, referred to as PBE fermentation.22−25 The process is different from the more common traditional Weizmann
process converting carbohydrates to ABE.26 When using saccharides as the sole carbon source for C. pasteurianum, it mainly produces organic acids
such as acetic and butyric acids.19,27 Butyrate is
an intermediate in the respective fermentation pathway, leading to
butanol, and the external addition of butyrate can significantly and
efficiently enhance butanol production when glycerol is the sole carbon
source.28−31 The addition of acetate has also been reported to enhance butanol
production for some Clostridium species.31,32 However, C. pasteurianum appears
to not fully convert these acids when grown on saccharides, a limitation
that does not exist with glycerol as the main carbon source. The addition
of butyric acid to fermentative glycerol conversion by C. pasteurianum has been shown to shift its product
distribution toward butanol.33−35 An alternative to adding butyrate
to the fermentation medium is to utilize a cosubstrate system, which
can take advantage of the substrate with lower costs than butyrate.

Jerusalem artichokes (Helianthus tuberosus L.) have been shown as an alternative source of saccharides for
the fermentative production of butanol in the ABE process; they can
be cultivated on the marginal land and are resistant to typical plant
diseases, hence there is no direct competition with grain crops for
the arable land.36−39 Jerusalem artichoke tuber (as all members of the Asteraceae family)
is a rich source of inulin, a carbohydrate storage polymer of linear
chains of β (2 → 1)-linked d-fructose units
with α (1 → 2) bond-linked fructose cap.39 Inulin is the principal storage carbohydrate in the tuber
(15–20%); however, monomeric sugars such as sucrose, glucose,
and fructose can also be present.40 The
vast number of microorganisms is incapable of directly fermenting
inulin; therefore, prior hydrolysis to fructose and glucose is required
(enzymatically or via an acid catalyst).36,41 By comparison, hydrolysis via an acid catalyst can reach up to 98.5%
conversion in 35 min with byproduct concentrations below the inhibitory
threshold, while enzymatic conversion of the same Jerusalem artichoke
extract requires 24 h.36 Hydrolysis time
and catalyst costs will likely render acid hydrolysis to be the favorable
option. Availability and cost competitiveness of crude glycerol and
Jerusalem artichoke tubers make both excellent candidates for butanol
production.

Using Jerusalem artichoke hydrolysate (JAH) as the
source of carbohydrates
and glycerol as the main carbon source for C. pasteurianum might lead to the conversion of carbohydrates to organic acids,
which then stimulate the simultaneous butanol formation from glycerol.
Therefore, this study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of
employing the aforementioned cosubstrate strategy for the enhanced
butanol production with the C. pasteurianum DSM 525. In order to establish such a system, the effect of adding
acetate and butyrate on butanol formation by C. pasteurianum DSM 525 (from glycerol) was first investigated and confirmed. The
product formation by the same strain using different monosubstrates
was studied, followed by an optimization study of the cosubstrate
ratio. On the basis of the estimated optimal conditions, JAH and crude
glycerol (from the biodiesel manufacturing waste) were used as low-cost
carbon sources for the cosubstrate-based butanol production in a 5
L laboratory bench bioreactor.

Results and Discussion
The main
carbon source of the proposed process is glycerol, with
Jerusalem artichoke-derived carbohydrates functioning as a secondary
substrate. Hence, monomeric sugars were produced through acid hydrolysis
of Jerusalem artichoke tubers. The Jerusalem artichoke tuber had a
total solid content of ∼30% (oven-dried at 80 °C for 72
h).42 The carbohydrate composition (inulin
and free sugars) of the material before and after acid hydrolysis
is shown in Table 1. Over 91% of the initial available carbohydrates were recovered
as monomeric sugars after the hydrolysis consistent with previously
reported data.41 The bulk material was
at random location to verify homogeneity, which was given as seen
by the small standard deviation.

The goal of
this study was to increase butanol formation from glycerol
through the cometabolism of organic acids produced by the same organism
from sugars. Therefore, initially, the effect of direct addition of
acetic and butyric acids was investigated in batch cultures with a
medium containing 50 g L–1 of pure glycerol. As
shown in Figure 1a,
the addition of acetate improved the butanol yield from 0.28 ±
0.008 to 0.31 ± 0.015 gbutanol g(glycerol+acetate)–1, as the added acetate increased from 0 to 5
g L–1. However, the butanol productivity started
to decrease from 0.180 ± 0.005 to 0.160 ± 0.006 g L–1 h–1 as acetate addition was increased
from 3 to 5 g L–1 (Figure 1a). The addition of 3.0 g L–1 acetate improved the butanol yield by 10.7% without reducing the
rate. A study on the effect of acetate addition (up to 6 g L–1) on solvent production from 60 g L–1 of glucose
by Clostridium beijerinckiiNCIMB 8052 and C. beijerinckiiBA 101 indicates that the addition of acetate could
improve the butanol production, but for acetate addition greater than
4.7 g L–1, the butanol production started to decrease.32 However, unlike the work in this study, the
respective strains followed the ABE pathway using carbohydrates. It
was also reported that the effect of acetate on increasing butanol
production was correlated to the increase in the coenzyme-A transferase,
an enzyme that plays a key role in the butanol pathway.32,43

Figure 1 Effect
of acetate (a) and butyrate (b) addition on butanol yield
and productivity [anaerobic, 50 mL (in 150 mL shake flasks), 30 °C,
200 rpm, 40 h, 50 g L–1 glycerol, pH 6.8]. The values
are average of triplicate measurements ± standard deviation.

As shown in Figure 1b, the addition of butyrate improved the butanol production
yield
from 0.28 ± 0.008 to 0.37 ± 0.005 gbutanol g(glycerol+butyrate)–1, as the butyrate concentration
added was increased from 0 to 5 g L–1. The influence
on the 1,3-PDO production and therefore on the butanol/1,3-PDO ratio
(data not shown) is of larger relevance to this study, as also reported
elsewhere.33,35 The concentration of 1,3-PDO
decreased from 6.4 ± 0.17 to 4.6 ± 0.12 g L–1 as the added butyrate concentration was increased from 0 to 5 g
L–1. The reported values for butanol yields are
within the range typically achieved in the literature for pure glycerol
(0.26–0.36 g g–1) and crude glycerol (0.21–0.30
g g–1), as reviewed elsewhere.22 The butanol production rate however started to decrease
from 0.37 to 0.26 g L–1 h–1 as
butyrate was increased from 4 to 5 g L–1. The results
show that the addition of 4.0 g L–1 butyrate improved
the butanol yield to 0.36 ± 0.004 gbutanol g(glycerol+butyrate)–1 (22%) without decreasing the butanol production
rate. A related study investigated the effect of butyrate addition
using a fermentation medium containing 100 g L–1 of glycerol supplemented with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 g L–1 of butyrate by C. pasteurianum CH4.28 The results show that the addition of butyrate
could improve the butanol yield, but any further addition of butyrate
greater than 6 g L–1 decreased the butanol production
rate. Another study investigated the impact of butyric acid on butanol
formation by C. pasteurianum DSM 525
under pH-controlled condition using 45 g L–1 glycerol
supplemented with butyric acid.35 It was
concluded that the addition of butyric acid could improve the butanol
yield in moderate amounts (3 g L–1) without decreasing
the production rate; however, the metabolic rate decreased, and the
initial lag phase increased at elevated concentrations (>4 g L–1) while still increasing the butanol yield. On the
basis of the current models of involved pathways, butyryl-CoA can
reversibly be converted to butyric acid or directly to butanol, as
reviewed elsewhere.22 The external addition
of butyrate can therefore be assumed to result in butanol formation
via butyryl-CoA. The result obtained in this work is in agreement
with the results of both studies. Therefore, this study confirms that
acetate and butyrate addition especially butyrate is beneficial to
butanol production with C. pasteurianum DSM 525 using pure glycerol as the carbon source. A substrate that C. pasteurianum DSM 525 can convert to acetate and
butyrate yielding between 3 and 4 g L–1 would therefore
be a desirable cosubstrate when utilizing glycerol as the main carbon
source.

The product formation by C. pasteurianum was therefore studied using pure glycerol, crude glycerol, fructose,
glucose, fructose and glucose (same ratio as in JAH), and JAH as the
sole carbon sources. The use of the pure substrates was investigated
for control purposes, as batch-to-batch variations are expected for
crude glycerol and JAH. As shown in Figure 2, the major products of the C. pasteurianum substrate are butanol and 1,3-PDO
when grown on pure and crude glycerol, respectively. However, when
the strain is cultivated on sugar (fructose, glucose, fructose and
glucose, JAH), it produces mostly acetic and butyric acids. The highest
butyric acid concentration was achieved using glucose as the substrate,
whereas using JAH resulted in the highest acetic acid titer (Figure 2a). The highest butanol
and 1,3-PDO concentrations were obtained using pure glycerol as the
substrate; however, the 1,3-PDO concentration decreased significantly
using crude glycerol (from 6.4 to 4.4 g L–1) and
no 1,3-PDO was produced when this bacterium was cultivated on sugar
(Figure 2b). These
results indicate that JAH (sugar source) can be utilized by C. pasteurianum to appropriately produce acids to
serve as the precursor to stimulate the subsequent butanol production
from glycerol. The results presented in Figure 1 indicate further that the optimal substrate
ratio might exist for a maximum butanol yield.

pasteurianum DSM 525 using different substrates. The
values are average of triplicate measurements ± standard deviation.

The measured product profile obtained from pure
glycerol, crude
glycerol, and glucose fermentation is in agreement with values typically
found for these feedstocks fermented with C. pasteurianum DSM 525.44,45 To the best knowledge of the
authors, this is the first attempt to use fructose, a mixture of fructose
and glucose, and JAH as the substrates for fermentative butanol production
by C. pasteurianum DSM 525.

The
effect of acetic and butyric acid addition on butanol fermentation
was investigated above, showing that direct addition of acetate and
butyrate into the fermentation broth enhances butanol yield and productivity
(Figure 1). The results
shown in Figure 2 indicate
the suitability of JAH as a sugar source to be fermented by C. pasteurianum DSM 525 to produce acetic and butyric
acids. Therefore, as already mentioned, JAH (sugar source) and crude
glycerol can be fermented at the same time (cosubstrate strategy)
to conduct acetate and butyrate formation and butanol fermentation
simultaneously. To prevent inhibition due to high acid concentration
arising from a high sugar concentration and to enhance butanol production
yield without decreasing the butanol production rate, the initial
glycerol and sugar concentration should be optimized to maximize the
butanol yield and productivity.

All optimization studies were
performed using pure glycerol and
a synthetic medium simulating JAH at otherwise optimal butanol fermentation
condition.45 A central composite design
(CCD) was used to determine the experimental conditions. Table 2 shows the values
of the independent parameters and the experimental response (averages
of triplicates ±standard deviation).

The fermentation process
successfully produced butanol from pure
glycerol and a synthetic medium simulating JAH as the cosubstrate
under the tested conditions. The full dataset was fitted with a quadratic
model for both butanol yield and productivity as described in eq 3. The estimated parameters
for both responses are shown in Table 3. Both F values (57.8 and 41.4 for
the butanol yield and productivity, respectively) are higher than
the critical value, hence both models are considered significant.
On the basis of the P values, both factors (sugar
and glycerol concentration) were significant for butanol yield and
productivity, while the interaction parameter was only significant
in the yield model. The high coefficients of determination (R2) and adjusted coefficients of determination
Adj. R2 confirm the goodness of fit of
both models (Table 3).

The analysis yields the following model equations
for yields and
productivity 1   2  where YP/S is
the butanol yield per total substrate (g g–1), PRP is the butanol productivity (g L–1 h–1), and S1 and S2 are the sugar and glycerol concentrations,
respectively.

Visual inspection of the residuals implies them
to be normally
distributed (data not shown).

The interaction of the two parameters
was studied via response
surface methodology. Surface plots of the effects of glycerol concentration
and sugar concentration on butanol yield and productivity are shown
in Figure 3a,b, respectively.
The butanol yield and productivity are both a function of glycerol
concentration and sugar concentration. The plots clearly indicate
that an optimum exists within the observed design space for both responses.

concentration on (a) butanol yield and (b) butanol productivity.

The optimal combinations of the two parameters
were determined
via numerical optimization of the two model equations, yielding 53.7
g L–1 of glycerol and 12.4 g L–1 of sugars for optimal butanol yield and 50.0 g L–1 of glycerol and 8.2 g L–1 of sugar for maximum
butanol productivity. Validation experiments were carried out around
the identified optima (Table 4). A T test at 95% confidence showed that
the measured values did not significantly deviate from the model predictions,
hence the model can be considered capable at identifying maximum butanol
yield and productivity.

The optimization studies were carried
out with pure substrates
for reproducibility purposes. To confirm the applicability to industrial
substrates, confirmatory fermentations were conducted with JAH and
crude glycerol. The fermentations were initially carried out at the
identified conditions at the same scale as used during the optimization
experiments and compared to a cosubstrate fermentation using pure
substrates as shown in Figure 4. For the pure substrates, sugars and glycerol
were used in the culture directly after the inoculation, and all the
sugars were utilized by the culture within 15 h (Figure 4a,b). However, a slight lag
phase was observed in glycerol and sugar consumption, as well as organic
acid and solvent production using JAH and crude glycerol as substrates
(Figure 4c,d). On the
pure substrates, C. pasteurianum DSM
525 produced 15.2 ± 0.4 g L–1 of butanol, 3.9
± 0.15 g L–1 of 1,3-PDO, and 2.95 ± 0.18
g L–1of ethanol at the end of fermentation, as shown
in Figure 4a. The butanol
yield and overall productivity were 0.27 ± 0.01 gbutanol g(glycerol+butyrate)–1 and 0.74 ±
0.02 g L–1 h–1, respectively.
At the end of fermentation, the acid concentration was 0.11 ±
0.03 g L–1 for butyrate and 2.58 ± 0.02 g L–1 for acetate (Figure 4b). Acetate did not appear to be used by C. pasteurianum DSM 525 in cosubstrate fermentation.
Fermentation with JAH and crude glycerol showed identical butanol
production yield (within error) compared to using pure substrates.
However, the butanol productivity decreased from 0.74 to 0.56 g L–1 h–1 using crude glycerol and JAH
as cosubstrates. This deviation is a direct result of the longer lag
phase. In general, the results clearly demonstrate the feasibility
of using JAH and crude glycerol as low-cost carbon sources to enhance
butanol production. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is
the first attempt to use JAH and crude glycerol as carbon sources
for fermentative butanol production in a cosubstrate system.

and cosubstrate condition by C. pasteurianum DSM 525 (anaerobic, 50 mL, 30 °C, 200 rpm).

Another study investigated the optimal glucose to pure glycerol
ratio (20:60 g L–1) for the strain C. pasteurianum CH4 (an isolate from anaerobic sludge).28 The simultaneous cosubstrate strategy obtained
a final butanol concentration, an overall productivity, and a yield
of 13.2 g L–1, 0.19 g L–1 h–1, and 0.21 gbutanol g(glycerol+glucose)–1, respectively, whereas using pure glycerol as
the sole carbon source resulted in a butanol concentration, productivity,
and yield of 11.5 g L–1, 0.13 g L–1 h–1, and 0.16 gbutanol g(glycerol+glucose)–1, respectively.28 Moreover,
bagasse and crude glycerol as cosubstrates were also converted into
butanol with a butanol concentration, an overall productivity, and
a yield of 11.8 g L–1, 0.14 g L–1 h–1, and 0.19 gbutanol g(glycerol+glucose)–1, respectively, with a fermentation time of 4–5
days (96–120 h),28 substantially
longer than the 35 h used in this study. Higher fermentation temperature
and iron-limiting condition may explain lower butanol yields and productivity.
It has been reported that the optimal fermentation temperature for
butanol production by C. pateurianum is 30 °C45,46 and that the iron-limited condition
enhances 1,3-PDO production over butanol.19 Additional deviation can be potentially explained by strain characteristics
of the Clostridia (CH4 vs DSM 525).
However, pure glycerol and glucose as carbon sources (wt ratio 1:1)
have been reported to be fermented by C. pateurianum DSM 525, with a butanol concentration, an overall productivity,
and a yield of 21.1 g L–1, 0.69 g L–1 h–1, and 0.23 gbutanol g(glycerol+glucose)–1, respectively.44 This
is one of the highest reported final butanol concentrations when using
conventional batch fermentation as butanol is toxic to Clostridia spp., and consequently, wild-type strains
of C. pasteurianum rarely achieve a
final concentration of butanol larger than 17 g L–1. Furthermore, biomass hydrolysate and pure glycerol as cosubstrates
were also fermented into butanol, and a butanol concentration, an
overall productivity, and a yield of 17.4 g L–1,
0.62 g L–1 h–1, and 0.2 gbutanol g(glycerol+glucose)–1 were
achieved, respectively, with a fermentation time of 50 h.44 Higher fermentation temperature and lower glycerol
to glucose ratio (1:1, 50 g L–1 of glycerol + 50
g L–1 of glucose) may explain the lower butanol
yield and productivity compared to the results obtained in this study.
Higher butanol yield (0.27 g L–1 vs 0.2 g L–1), higher butanol productivity (0.74 g L–1 h–1 vs 0.69 g L–1 h–1), and shorter fermentation time (35 h vs 50 h) of this study make
it more industrially advantageous. Utilizing crude glycerol instead
of pure glycerol in a cosubstrate strategy is also a more relevant
carbon source.

To verify the validity of the cosubstrate fermentation
method by C. pasteurianum DSM 525 in
larger scale, fermentations
were carried out in a 5 L benchtop bioreactor using JAH and crude
glycerol as feedstocks, and the results are presented in Figure 5. In addition to
the offline-determined substrate and product concentrations, pH, CO2 formation, and cell density were measured online (Figure 5b). A butanol yield
and a productivity of 0.28 ± 0.01 gbutanol g(glycerol+sugar)–1 and 0.55 ± 0.01 g L–1 h–1 were achieved after 27 h fermentation using
a cosubstrate strategy. The fermentation was considered complete after
27 h based on the online signals of CO2 formation and cell
dry weight (CDW). The online signal for CO2 represents
biological CO2 production as well as CO2 release
from the CaCO3 buffer with decreasing pH (Figure 5b). Therefore, the shown value
does not exclusively result in biological activity. The pH of the
fermentation medium was not controlled; it was initially adjusted
to 6.8 (optimal initial pH, estimated elsewhere45) and was subsequently allowed to decrease until it reached
5.01 (Figure 5b). Cell
growth was continuously measured with an online turbidity probe, and
a short lag phase is followed by exponential growth, leading to high
final CDW (Figure 5b).

using JAH and crude glycerol (a), CO2 formation pH and
CDW formation (b) under optimized fermentation conditions and glycerol-to-sugar
concentration by C. pasteurianum DSM
525. The discrete data points (a) are average of triplicate measurements
± standard deviation; the connecting lines are for visualization
purposes only. The smooth lines in (b) are the results of online measurements.

At optimized conditions, the butanol production
achieved in the
5 L reactor vessel and in anaerobic shake flasks were within error
of each other, indicating that the scaled-down shake flask conditions
used in the optimization study were a suitable representation of reactor
conditions.

This study focused on the cosubstrate fermentation
of Jerusalem
artichoke tubers and crude glycerol for the production of butanol.
The small-scale batch fermentation is not intended to represent an
industrial process, where more advanced fermentation process design
and control would be applied. Overall productivity improvements could
be achieved through continuous fermentation and/or in situ product
removal, as evaluated elsewhere for different feedstocks.47,48

Conclusions
Butanol production by C. pasteurianum DSM 525 from glycerol was significantly enhanced by adding organic
acids, especially butyric acid, directly to the fermentation medium.
These organic acids can be directly produced by C.
pasteurianum DSM 525 through the conversion of sugars.
A cosubstrate system was characterized and optimized for pure feedstocks
and could directly be transferred to the relevant carbon sources of
crude glycerol and JAH. The system is a potential way to utilize an
industrial waste stream and a dedicated energy crop for the efficient
production of an advanced biofuel.

Materials and Methods
Complex media ingredients (peptone, yeast/beef extract) were purchased
from BD-Becton, Dickinson and Company (New Jersey, USA). Sodium acetate,
soluble starch, thiamine, and resazurin were obtained from Alfa Aesar
(Massachusetts, USA), while CaCO3 and dextrose were purchased
from Amresco (Ohio, USA) and CaCl2 from EMD Millipore (Massachusetts,
USA). Sulfuric acid (18.0 M), MnSO4·H2O,
(NH4)2SO4, KH2PO4, MgSO4·7H2O, and K2HPO4 were obtained from Caledon (Ontario, Canada). l-Cysteine,
pure glycerol, NaCl, and FeSO4·7H2O were
purchased from BDH (Georgia, USA). Biotin, sodium butyrate, p-aminobenzoic acid, and 2-(N-morpholino)
ethanesulfonic acid (MES) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri,
USA).

Crude glycerol was kindly provided by Newalta Corp. (AB
Canada).
The received crude glycerol is a gel-like viscous material of dark
brownish color. For further use, the material was homogenized through
mechanical shaking, followed by preparing an aqueous solution (250
g of crude glycerol in 500 mL of deionized water) which was filtered
three times (0.2 μm grade filters) to remove solids. The stock
solution was diluted as required for fermentation trials and filter
prior to use. Glycerol analysis was conducted with a 250-fold dilution
of the stock solution (a clear liquid), indicating that the crude
glycerol concentration in the stock solution was 240 ± 3 g L–1, while the methanol concentration (residue) was considered
too low to negatively impact the microbial activity (data not shown).

Jerusalem artichoke tubers were kindly provided by the Institute
for Chemicals and Fuels from Alternative Resources (ICFAR), University
of Western Ontario. The raw material was prepared and characterized
as described elsewhere.41,42 In brief, tubers were
washed and cut to ∼2 cm3 cubes, dried (105 °C
for 72 h), ground (250 μm mesh), and stored at 4 °C.

JA characterization and inulin extraction: 15 g of JA powder and
300 mL of water were stirred for 1 h (300 rpm, 25 °C), and solids
were separated through centrifugation (20 min at 12 000g). The supernatant contained 0.52 g g–1 of inulin, 0.16 g g–1 of fructose, 0.1 g g–1 of glucose, and 0.05 g g–1 of sucrose
(extractables), while 0.03 g g–1 of cellulose and
0.02 g g–1 of hemicellulose were found in the precipitate
(nonextractable). Because of the low cellulose and hemicellulose content,
only the supernatant was used for further processing.

Batch
acid hydrolysis: Conditions were based on previously reported
data (pH 2.0 adjusted with sulfuric acid, 97 °C, 35 min).41 The final liquid was filtered (0.2 μm
grade filters) and stored at −20 °C for analysis. The
pH of the hydrolysate was adjusted to 6.8 (1 M NaOH) prior to fermentations.

Shake flask studies and all precultures were cultivated in an anaerobic
chamber (model 855-ACB, Plas Labs, Lansing, MI).

C. pasteurianum DSM 525 was obtained
from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms
and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) and cultivated on reinforced Clostridium medium (RCM): 10 g L–1 of peptone, 10 g L–1 of beef extract, 3 g L–1 of yeast extract, 5 g L–1 of dextrose,
5 g L–1 of NaCl, 1 g L–1 of soluble
starch, 0.5 g L–1 of l-cysteine, and 4
mL/L of resazurin (pH 6.8). Stock culture (OD600 of 0.8)
was stored at −80 °C in glycerol (20%, w/v). Precultures
(RCM) were obtained from the frozen stock after heat shock (2 min
at 90 °C) and used as inoculum once they reached ∼50 of
the final growth (∼16 h).

Fermentation and optimization
studies were conducted in 150 mL
flasks containing 50 mL of modified Biebl medium36,45,49 containing glycerol (as needed), 1 g L–1 of yeast extract, 0.5 g L–1 of
KH2PO4, 0.5 g L–1 of K2HPO4, 5 g L–1 of (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g L–1 of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.02 g L–1 of CaCl2·2H2O, 0.1 g L–1 of FeSO4·7H2O, 2 g L–1 of CaCO3, 0.01 mg/L of biotin, 1 mg/L of thiamine, 1 mg/L of p-aminobenzoic acid, 4 mL/L of trace element solution (SL7), as described elsewhere.24 Flasks
(40 mL medium) were inoculated with 0.4 g LCDW–1 of actively growing culture and cultivated for 40 h (anaerobic chamber,
30 °C, 200 rpm, initial pH of 6.8). Intermitted samples were
filtered (0.2 μm grade filters) and stored at −20 °C
prior to analysis.

A CCD was selected to evaluate the response
pattern and to determine
the optimal combination of glycerol and sugar concentration for maximizing
the butanol yield and productivity. The general design space was chosen
based on previous experiments (data not shown), yielding the following
parameter values (uncoded) [low star point, low central point, center
point, high central point, high star point]: glycerol concentration
in g L–1 [23.6, 30, 50.0, 70, 76.4] and sugar concentration
in g L–1 [1.8, 5, 15, 25, 28.2]. The resulting conditions
(including three center points) were tested in triplicates, resulting
in 33 experiments (12 factorial + 12 augmented + 9 center points)
that were randomized prior to testing.

The experimental data
were fitted to a second-order polynomial
model via linear regression analysis using Design-Expert 8.0.7.1 3  

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the significance
of each model term based on an α of 0.05 using the F-test. Numerical optimization was done via Design-Expert 8.0.7.1,
followed by the experimental validation point near the predicted optimum.

Lab-scale stirred-tank bioreactor fermentation: a Labfors 4 system
(Infors, Quebec, Canada) was used (5 L of nominal volume, 2.7 L of
modified Biebl medium, 0.3 L of preculture, 0.2 mL of antifoam, 30
°C, 150 rpm using one Rushton impeller). The pH was monitored
but not controlled (Hamilton EasyFerm, Switzerland), so were redox
potential (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) and cell density (TruCell2,
Finesse Solutions, LLC, USA). The online cell density signal was correlated
with CDW measurements from offline samples (CDW was determined via
filtration of 5 mL samples (cellulose filter) as the weight difference
of the filter before and after drying for 48 h at 80 °C). Anaerobic
conduction and flow for off-gas analysis (Infors, Quebec, Canada)
were achieved via nitrogen sparging (0.3 L min–1). Offline analysis was conducted on samples taken and prepared as
described above.

The fermentation broth was analyzed for substrates
and products
via Agilent 1260 infinity HPLC (Agilent USA, Santa Clara). The analytes
were separated on an Agilent Hi-plex H (7.7 × 300 mm) column
(Agilent USA, Santa Clara) at 35 °C and detected with a refractive
index detector. The mobile phase was 0.005 M H2SO4 (isocratic, 0.4 mL min–1).

Product yields
were calculated as the highest detected butanol
concentration divided by the sum of substrates consumed at the point
expressed as gbutanol g(glycerol+sugar)–1 for glycerol and carbohydrate fermentations or as
gbutanol g(glycerol+added acid)–1, when the medium was complimented with organic acids. Productivities
were expressed as the highest detected butanol concentration over
fermentation time (g L–1 h–1).
