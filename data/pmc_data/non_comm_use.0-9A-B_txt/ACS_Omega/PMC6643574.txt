A molecular
anion of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) was
generated by a pulsed discharge to the solid sample
under supersonic expansion and its photoelectron spectrum was recorded
after mass selection. The vertical detachment energy of Alq3– and the adiabatic electron affinity of Alq3 were determined to be 1.24 ± 0.01 and 0.89 ± 0.04
eV, respectively. By using these energies determined for monomeric
Alq3, the reorganization energy for the intermolecular
electron transport in bulk Alq3 was estimated to be 0.70
± 0.08 eV.

1 Introduction
Organic
semiconductors are widely used in various devices including
organic light-emitting diodes,1 organic
photovoltaics,2 and organic field-effect
transistors.3 However, the performance
of electron transport materials (ETMs) is more difficult to predict
than that of hole transport materials because electron affinity in
the solid phase (EAbulk), a key descriptor of the electron
transport properties, cannot be determined precisely. To circumvent
the problems, much effort has been made to directly determine the
EAbulk value using inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES)4,5 on a film and photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) on a negative ion
on the film. However, the EAbulk values determined by these
methods are significantly different: the EAbulk values
of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3; Scheme 1), for example, were determined
to be 2.066 and ∼2.5 eV7 by IPES and PES, respectively. This discrepancy
is partly due to the difference in the measurement schemes. IPES gives
the vertical energy required to attach the electron to a relaxed molecule
in the film, whereas PES gives the vertical energy to remove the electron
from the relaxed anion in the solvation shell.

Scheme 1 (a) Meridional and
(b) Facial Isomers of Alq3; Color Codes:
Pink (Al); Red (O); Blue (N); Black (C); and Gray (H)
The EAbulk can be estimated by an
indirect method based
on the EA value of the constituent monomer (EAmono): the
EAbulk is estimated by stabilizing the EAmono by the polarization energy and intermolecular electronic coupling.8,9 The EA of a monomer molecule is determined by PES of the corresponding
molecular anion in the gas phase. PES on size-selected cluster anions
of molecules also provides a novel opportunity to probe the evolutional
behavior of the unoccupied states as a function of the numbers of
the constituent molecules.10

The
first aim of this study is to develop a new production method
of a molecular anion from the solid sample for the PES experiment.
The second aim is to determine experimentally the vertical detachment
energy (VDE) of Alq3– and the adiabatic
electron affinity (AEA) of Alq3. Then, the PES results
on the Alq3 monomer were used to estimate the reorganization
energy for the intermolecular electron transport in bulk Alq3 (λbulk) following the previous treatment applied
for electron transfer (ET) between Fe ion complexes in solution11 and hole transport properties of solid materials.10,12 These results are compared with those of theoretical calculations.
Finally, we discuss reliability of the EAbulk values previously
reported6,7 by comparing the polarization energies of
the Alq3+ cation and the Alq3– anion.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 AEA and VDE
Figure 1a shows a typical mass spectrum of anionic
species of Alq3. Figure 1a exhibits the mass peaks for the parent ion Alq3– and the fragment ion Alq2–. This result demonstrates that the pulsed discharge
nozzle (PDN) is a convenient tool for desorbing intact molecular anions
from the solid samples. Figure 1b shows the photoelectron spectrum of Alq3– and exhibits a single peak at ∼1.2 eV: the
VDE value corresponding to the peak top was determined to be 1.24
± 0.01 eV by fitting three independent spectra with a Gaussian
function. The AEA value corresponding to the spectral onset could
not be determined unambiguously because the (0, 0) origin peak is
not visible in the spectrum. Thus, the AEA value was determined to
be 0.89 ± 0.04 eV by the energy at which the second derivative
of the spectrum took a local maximum. The AEA of solid Alq3 (2.06 eV)5 and photoemission threshold
from the Alq3– anion located on the surface
of Alq3 (2.5 eV)6 are significantly
larger than that of the Alq3 monomer mainly due to the
polarization energy.4

Figure 1 (a) Negative ion mass
spectrum of the anionic species generated
by the PDN source and (b) photoelectron spectrum of mass-selected
Alq3–.

The structures of the meridional and facial isomers of neutral
Alq3 in singlet states (1 and 2, respectively) and anionic Alq3– in
doublet states (3 and 4, respectively) were
optimized. The atomic coordinates of 1–4 are listed
in Table S1, and the relative stabilities
between the isomers are compared in Table 1. For neutral Alq3, meridional
isomer 1 is more stable than facial isomer 2 by 0.24 eV. This result is consistent with the fact that Alq3 molecules in the commercially available reagents are in the
meridional form.13 In the anionic state,
meridional isomer 3 was also more stable than facial
isomer 4 by 0.26 eV. The higher stability of meridional
isomers both in neutral and anionic states strongly suggests that
Alq3– in our beam takes meridional form 3. The AEA value of 1 was calculated as the energy
difference between 1 and 3 and that of 2 was calculated as the energy difference between 2 and 4. The experimental AEA value (0.89 ± 0.04
eV) is similar to that calculated for 1 (1.02 eV) (Table 1). The VDE values
of 3 and 4 were calculated to be 1.18 and
1.06 eV (Table 1),
respectively, from the energy differences between the corresponding
neutral states with the geometries of 3 and 4. The experimental VDE value (1.24 ± 0.01 eV) is comparable
to that predicted for 3 (1.18 eV). The vertical electron
affinities (VEAs) of 1 and 2 were calculated
from the energy difference between the corresponding anionic states
with the geometries of 1 and 2, respectively.
The VEA values of 1 and 2 (Table 1) are similar to those reported
previously (0.95 and 0.94 eV, respectively).14

2.2 Reorganization Energy
The electron
transporting properties of ETMs are described by a simple ET model,
in which the electron localized at a certain molecule hops to the
neighboring molecule. Within the framework of this hopping model,
the rate constant C for ET is given by the following
formula15,16 1  where k, ℏ, T, V, and λ represent
the Boltzmann
constant, the reduced Planck constant, temperature, electronic coupling
matrix element, and reorganization energy, respectively.16Equation 1 predicts that the ET rate increases with a decrease in λ,
indicating that the estimation of reorganization energy λ is
a key for rational development of useful ETMs.

We herein applied
a simple method for estimating the λbulk value for
the intermolecular ET in a solid of molecule M.17Figure 2a shows the schematic potential curves for ET from the anion M– to an adjacent M in the bulk film that accompanies
the change in inter- and intramolecular structures from geometry X
to Y. Because this ET process is thermoneutral, λbulk corresponds to the energy required for the ET from M– to another M while retaining both inter- and intramolecular structures
at geometry X. Namely, the λbulk value is given by 2  where
VDEbulk is the energy required
to remove an electron from M– in the bulk to vacuum
leaving internally excited M* at fixed geometry X. ΔE is the energy gained by the electron attachment to a molecule
M adjacent to M* at fixed geometry X. The energy gap ΔE is approximated by the energy gained by the electron attachment
to M in the bulk at the relaxed geometry (VEAbulk), if
we assume that the stabilization energies due to the structural relaxation
of M* and to the rearrangement of the intermolecular structure are
the same before (δ1) and after (δ2) the electron attachment (eq 3).16 λbulk is further approximated by the difference between VDE
and VEA of the monomer M because the cohesion energies before and
after the ET at geometry X are considered to be nearly the same (eq
4).  However, the VEA value cannot be determined
experimentally when it has a positive value.18 It is clear from Figure 2b that the difference between VDE and VEA in eq 4 is given
by the summation of the relaxation energy of M* after electron detachment
from M– (δn) and that of M–* after electron attachment to M (δa) (eq 5). When the structures of M and M– are similar,
δa and δn are approximated to be
equal (eq 6).11 In this case, the λbulk value is given in terms of VDE of M– and AEA of M as shown in eq 7.  

Figure 2 Potential
energy surfaces associated with (a) the intermolecular
ET in the film of M and (b) electron attachment to M and detachment
from M–. Red triangles and blue spheres represent
M– and M in their most stable structures, respectively.
Blue triangles (M*) and red spheres (M–*) represent
the neutral molecule with the same geometry as the ground state of
M– and the anionic molecule with the same geometry
as the ground state of M. VDE: vertical detachment energy; VEA: vertical
electron affinity; AEA: adiabatic electron affinity.

Namely, the amplitude of λbulk reflects the difference
between the stable structures in neutral and anionic states of the
corresponding monomer as can be seen from Figure 2b. The λbulk value of Alq3 was experimentally determined from eq 7 to be 0.70 ±
0.08 eV. This λbulk value is most probably overestimated
because the AEA value in eq 7 was underestimated because of tailing
of the spectral profile toward lower binding energy because of a limited
resolution of the spectrometer. The validity of the approximation
made in eq 7 was confirmed by the similarity in the λbulk values of calculated for Alq3 (1) using
eqs 4 and 7; 0.28 and 0.33 eV, respectively. The λbulk value of meridional Alq3 was reported to be 0.276 eV
by density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G*
level.13 According to Figure 2b, the small λbulk value is associated with the small structure change upon electron
attachment to meridional Alq3 and detachment from meridional
Alq3–. This interpretation is supported
by significant overlap of structures of 1 and 3 (Figure S1). Structure analysis revealed
that the difference in the Al–O and Al–N bond lengths
is 5% at the most and that the major difference is the angle of a
single ligand. The experimental λbulk value (0.70
± 0.08 eV) is larger than the calculated value (0.33 eV). However,
it is beyond the scope of this study to discuss which λbulk value determined experimentally or theoretically is more
reliable and is closer to the true λbulk value.

Finally, the λbulk values for other ETMs were
estimated using eqs 4 and 7 and are listed in Table 2. The structural formulae and atomic coordinates
of the optimized geometries for anionic and neutral states are listed
in Tables S2–S10. Overall, the λbulk values are small (<∼0.5 eV) because of the similarities
in the structures of anions and neutrals. The results of Table 2 support that small
λbulk values are fundamental requirements for efficient
electron transportation.

Finally, we discuss
reliability of the EAbulk values
reported previously [2.06 (LEIPS),6 2.5
(anion PES),7 and 3.27 eV (optical gap)6 by considering the polarization energies of the
Alq3+ cation and the Alq3– anion, P+ and P–, respectively. As discussed in ref (9), P+ and P– are stabilization
energies of Alq3 ions with surrounding Alq3 molecules
mainly via charge-permanent dipole (electrostatic) and charge-induced
dipole (electronic polarization) interactions. We can approximate
that P+ and P– are nearly equivalent because the permanent dipoles of Alq3 molecules are oriented randomly in the amorphous film. Under such
approximation, the P+ value is calculated
to be 1.8 eV from the difference of the ionization energy of the bulk
film (5.45 eV)19 and that of the isolated
monomer (7.25 eV).20 In contrast, the P– values estimated from the difference
between EAbulk and EAmono (0.89 eV) are 1.2,
1.6, and 2.4 eV when the values of 2.06,6 2.5,7 and 3.27 eV6 are used as EAbulk, respectively. We conclude from the
comparison between P+ and P– that the EAbulk value determined by
the anion PES7 is more reasonable than
those determined by LEIPS or optical gap.

3 Conclusion
PES was applied on a mass-selected beam of a molecular anion of
tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3) generated by
a PDN. The VDE of Alq3– and the AEA of
Alq3 were determined to be 1.24 ± 0.01 and 0.89 ±
0.04 eV, respectively. We estimated the reorganization energy for
the electron transport in the bulk Alq3 (λbulk) based on the AEA and VDE values of the corresponding monomer. Two
assumptions made for this estimation were: (1) the relaxation energies
for the photodetached neutral Alq3* are the same regardless whether the solvation
shell contains the Alq3– anion or not;
(2) the relaxation energy of the Alq3 monomer after photodetachment
and that of the Alq3– anion after the
electron attachment are the same. The λbulk value
estimated based on the PES data of Alq3– was 0.70 ± 0.08 eV, whereas the theoretical calculations gave
a value of 0.33 eV. The λ values theoretically estimated for
various ETMs were in the range of 0.05–0.6 eV, reflecting a
small structural change upon electron attachment to and detachment
from these molecules.

4 Methods
4.1 Experimental
Section
Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram
of the experimental apparatus. The apparatus consists of a PDN21−23 modified for solid samples, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS),
and a magnetic bottle-type photoelectron spectrometer (MBPS).24−26 The anion of Alq3 was generated using a PDN (inset, Figure 3). The PDN was operated
by applying a pulsed voltage (−1 to −2 kV, 10 Hz) to
the cathode onto which the solid sample of Alq3 was deposited
under the pulsed expansion of Ar gas (purity: >99.999%) with a
stagnation
pressure of ∼0.2 MPa. The product anions were extracted perpendicularly
to the initial beam direction by applying a pulsed electric field
to the grids, and then were accelerated to 3 keV, and analyzed by
the TOF-MS. The Alq3– thus produced was
mass-separated and introduced to the MBPS, and then irradiated by
an unfocused second harmonics output from an Nd:YAG laser (532 nm).
The photoelectrons were detected using a micro-channel plate. The
photoelectron spectra were obtained by the accumulations of 80 000
laser shots and were smoothed by averaging the photoelectron counts
of ten neighboring points after background subtraction. The binding
energies of the photoelectrons were calibrated against the photoelectron
spectrum of I– obtained by using the fourth harmonics
output from an Nd:YAG laser (266 nm). The energy resolution of the
MBPS was 65 meV at a kinetic energy of 1 eV.

apparatus. Inset shows a PDN source.

4.2 Computational Section
Alq3 has two isomers: a meridional isomer with C1 symmetry and a facial isomer with C3 symmetry (Scheme 1). Three oxygen and three nitrogen atoms of the quinoline
ligands are located on opposite ridges of the octahedron in the former,
whereas they form opposing faces of the octahedron in the latter.
Electronic and geometric structures of two isomers of Alq3– and Alq3 were calculated by DFT at
the level of B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) using the Gaussian 09 program.27 The AEA value of Alq3 corresponded
to the energy differences between Alq3– and Alq3 at their most stable structures. The VDE value
of Alq3– was obtained by subtracting
the energies from those of the corresponding neutral state with the
identical geometries. Zero-point corrections were not conducted.
