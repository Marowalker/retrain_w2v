Circular
dichroisms (CDs) of planar chiral 4-bromo[2.2]paracyclophane
(1) and three isomeric dibromo[2.2]paracyclophanes (p-2, m′-2, and o′-2) were investigated
experimentally and theoretically. They all exhibited strong multisignate
Cotton effects (CEs) at the 1Lb, 1La, and 1B transitions of the component (bromo)benzene
chromophore and were comparable to each other. For all of the cyclophanes
examined, the enantiomer that eluted earlier from a chiral high-performance
liquid chromatography column (Chiralcel IA or IB) exhibited negative
and positive CEs at the 1Lb and 1La bands, respectively, which were followed by a more
complicated pattern of CDs at the higher-energy bands. These CD features
were well reproduced by quantum chemical calculations, allowing us
to unambiguously assign the absolute configurations of the first-eluted
enantiomers as Rp in all of the cases
examined. Interestingly, the CDs of 1 and 2, although largely comparable in shape, were still sensitive to the
number and pattern of bromine substitution, showing closer resemblance
between m′-2 and o′-2 and between p-2 and 1. The theoretical calculations also reproduced
successfully these spectral resemblance between them. The anisotropy
(g) factors for the 1Lb bands
of these cyclophanes were considerably large (∼10–2), whereas those for the 1La band were conventional
in the order of 10–3. In addition, a weak CE was
observed in the low-energy region at around 320 nm, which turned out
to originate from the interplanar interaction and is hence assigned
to the “cyclophane band”. The experimental g factors of this band were fairly large in the order of 10–2, but the computation turned out to be quite challenging and were
less well reproduced theoretically, ascribable to the forbidden nature
of the transition.

Introduction
Possessing unique planar
chirality,1−3 [2.2]paracyclophanes
have been utilized in various applications, such as coordinated metal
catalysts and supramolecular assemblies.4−7 Brominated cyclophanes are versatile starting
materials for the preparation of more complex cyclophane derivatives.
Somewhat surprisingly, the study on the circular dichroism (CD) arising
from the planar chirality of these cyclophanes is still quite limited,8 and practically no systematic efforts have hitherto
been devoted to the investigation of the chiroptical properties of
substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes.9,10 In particular,
the “cyclophane band”,11 observed
in the low-energy region specifically for smaller [2.n]cyclophanes due to the interplanar interactions, has rarely been
examined comprehensively from the chiroptical viewpoint. In the present
study, we compared the CD spectra of monobrominated cyclophane (1) as well as all of the possible C2-symmetric chiral dibromo[2.2]paracyclophanes (p-2, m′-2, and o′-2) (see Chart 1).12 As anticipated,
all of these cyclophanes exhibited strong, mutually resembling Cotton
effects (CEs) at the 1Lb, 1La, and 1B transitions, owing to their planar chirality.
Additionally, the cyclophane band appearing in the low-energy region
gave appreciable CE with high anisotropy (g) factors
in the order of 10–2.

Chart 1 Planar Chiral Mono-
and Dibromo[2.2]paracylophanes 1–2
These brominated cyclophanes
serve as a model system suitable for
not only understanding the chiroptical consequences of planar chirality
but also evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the state-of-the-art
theoretical CD prediction. We found that the advanced theoretical
calculations successfully reproduce the characteristic experimental
CD patterns in sign and order for the strong 1Lb, 1La, and 1B transitions of 1–2, allowing unambiguous determination
of the absolute configurations. However, the overall reproducibility
was slightly lower, when compared with the results for other rigid
chiral organic molecules of similar or slightly larger sizes, due
to the complicated origin of transitions associated with the interplanar
π–π and linker-incorporated σ–π
interactions in the current system. Inspection of the weak CEs at
the cyclophane band will provide additional insights for better understanding
the nature of the interplanar interactions in cyclophane. It turned
out, however, to be more challenging to accurately reproduce the observed
CEs at the cyclophane band by any of the current theoretical methods,
possible reasons for which will be discussed below.

Results and Discussion
Structure
The structure of [2.2]paracyclophanes has
attracted much attention and has long been a target of extensive experimental
and theoretical investigations.13 The most
accurate X-ray crystallographic structure of parent [2.2]paracyclophane
shows twisted D2 symmetry with a dihedral
angle ΦC(Ar)–C–C–C(Ar) of 12.6°
and an interplane distance d of 3.10 Å (Table 1). The theoretical
reproduction of [2.2]paracyclophane structure has been challenged
by a number of methods, rendering this system a benchmark for assessing
the accuracy of the theory employed. The standard density functional
theory (DFT) with B3LYP functional failed to provide the correct structure,
and the structure with D2h symmetry (Φ = 0) was obtained as a minimum. Although the MP2
calculation circumvented such deficiency, it overestimated the dihedral
angle (Φ = 18.7°). The situation was slightly improved
using the spin-component scaled second-order Møller–Plesset
(SCS-MP2)14 method (Φ = 17.6°),
which has been frequently employed as an alternative to the gold standard
CCSD(T) ansatz. The recent investigation has underlined that the medium-range
dispersion correction is crucial for a cost-effective, yet accurate
prediction of the cyclophane structures.15 For instance, interplane distances of various [2.2]cyclophanes can
be precisely predicted with errors much less than 0.01 Å using
the dispersion-corrected DFT method with Becke–Johnson (BJ)
dumping function. Accordingly, we calculated the optimized geometries
for all of the brominated [2.2]paracyclophanes 1–2 at the DFT-D3(BJ)-TPSS/def2-TZVP level,16,17 which was quite successful indeed, affording the geometrical parameters
comparable to those obtained by X-ray crystallography (Table 1). Compatibility of the theoretical
method of choice with cyclophane structure has also been justified
by our recent investigations on pyridinophane systems.18−20 Because crystal structures are not available for some cyclophanes,
we employed these DFT-D3-optimized structures for the following theoretical
CD investigation. The parent [2.2]paracyclophane possesses a shallow
double-minimum potential along the dihedral-angle coordinate (two
minima at Φ = ±12.6°). As such, the weighted average
of the two conformers at the TD-DFT-B3LYP/TZV2P′//MP2/TZVP
level was used to reproduce the experimental CD spectrum of 4-fluoro[2.2]paracyclophane,8 whereas the minor conformer was missing at the
B3LYP/TZVP-level geometry optimization.21 In all of the brominated [2.2]paracyclophanes employed in this study,
the twisting of ethylene bridge toward the bromine atom is avoided
due to the greater steric hindrance in these brominated cyclophanes.
In this relation, Grimme and Bahlmann pointed out an additional possibility
in conformer structure, i.e., the parallel-displaced, rather than
twisted, conformer observed in methylcyclophane thoroughly discussed
previously.8 We were unable to find the
corresponding conformer in the case of brominated cyclophanes. Accordingly,
a single conformer possessing a positive dihedral angle was obtained
as the optimized structure for each of cyclophanes 1–2. The overall twist of Φ = 8.6–18.3° in
brominated cyclophanes was considerably larger than that of parent
[2.2]paracyclophane, whereas the interplane distance and the degree
of deformation were found quite comparable (vide infra).

Table 1 compares
the characteristic structural parameters for cyclophanes 1–2. The interplane distances measured at the
bottom center of each boat-shaped benzene unit (d) and at the bridgehead atom (d′) can be
used as indices for evaluating the interplanar orbital interactions,
which primarily affect the excitation energy and degree of degeneracy
in CD spectrum. The boat-type deformation in each benzene unit, which
is known to enhance the degeneracy in valence orbitals and increase
the energy separation, is represented by the deformation angles α
(for the bridgehead atom) and β (for the linker atom). Crucially,
these parameters (d, d′,
α, and β) were essentially the same in all of the brominated
[2.2]paracyclophanes examined, indicating that the common structural
features are preserved throughout the phenes employed, despite the
bromine substitution. Consequently, the interplanar interactions,
such as dispersion (van der Waals) and electrostatic (quadrupole–quadrupole)
contributions between any two of the dibromo-, monobromo-, and unsubstituted
benzene units, can be considered essentially the same for cyclophanes 1–2. In other words, the electronic contribution
of bromine atom(s) on the overall cyclophane structure is much less
pronounced than the steric effect of bromine(s) on the ethylene linker.
Accordingly, the twist angle, which is parameterized by C(Ar)–C–C–C(Ar)
dihedral angle (Φ), was found fairly sensitive to the number
and pattern of bromine substitution. It is to note that although the
formal classification defines the [2.2]paracyclophanes planar chiral,
the observed CEs at the main transitions are mostly determined by
the twisting between the phenes.8 Thus,
changing the twist angle is expected to significantly affect the chiroptical
properties of cyclophanes. In fact, the angle becomes progressively
larger by increasing the number of bromine substitution and the angle
is significantly larger on the brominated side (17.0–18.3°)
than on the nonbrominated side (7.1–11.0°). In brief,
the structural features of cyclophanes are very well reproduced by
the conventional theoretical calculations, when appropriately selected
for the required accuracy. The steric, rather than the electronic,
effect is more important in determining the structures of brominated
paracyclophanes.

Experimental CD Spectra
The experimental
CD spectra
of brominated [2.2]paracyclophens 1–2 were obtained in acetonitrile at 25 °C (Figure 1, left). The corresponding UV–vis
spectra and anisotropy (g = Δε/ε)
factor profiles are provided in Figures S5–S7 in the Supporting Information. The characteristic spectral features
based on the distinctive electronic structure of [2.2]paracyclophane
are apparent in their UV–vis spectra, exhibiting absorption
peaks at around 270, 230, and 200 nm, which are assignable to the 1La, 1Lb, and 1B bands, respectively. Additionally, weak absorption assignable to
the cyclophane band was observed as a tail at around 310 nm, which
is known as the specific transition observable only for [2.n]cyclophanes.11,24,25 In parent [2.2]paracyclophane, the lowest transition of B2u symmetry appears at 329
nm in single crystals at 20 K and at ≈305 nm in liquid media.26,27 The corresponding CD peaks were observed for all of the brominated
cyclophanes 1–2. Accordingly, the
band A with positive CE is assignable to the cyclophane band. Although
the intensity of CE was relatively weak (Δε ≤ 1),
the anisotropy factor was remarkably high in the order of 10–2, due to the forbidden nature of this transition. Naturally, the g factor is dependent on both the electronic and magnetic
transition moments, but the former seems more important as shown by
the weak absorption in the experimental UV spectra. Theoretical analysis
on the relevant transition moments was not feasible, as our current
theoretical calculations could not successfully reproduce the CD spectral
behavior of the cyclophane band (vide infra). The next CE of moderate
strength labeled band B was not decisive, but likely to originate
from the transition related to the 1Lb transition.
The bands C and D are attributed to the 1Lb and 1La transitions of phene chromophore. Their CE intensities
are high and comparable to each other (|Δε| = 16–38
M–1 cm–1), whereas the anisotropy
factor differs in 1 order of magnitude between the two bands, affording g = 10–3 for the former but much larger,
10–2, for the latter. The CE at band E and the higher-energy
portion of band D are mainly ascribable to the 1B transition.
It is to note that due to the complexity caused by the dense population
of various states, the assignment of the apparent CD peak to specific
transition(s) is not immediately feasible and hence our present assignment
is rather tentative and may be used for a guiding purpose only. For
more detailed band assignment, one can refer to the specific transition
configuration through the computational results (for the examples
of densely populated transitions, see the bar spectra in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). A more
precise assignment of the UV–vis spectra of unsubstituted cyclophanes
can be found in the literature.28,29

Figure 1 Experimental and calculated
CD spectra of brominated [2.2]paracyclophanes 1–2. Experimental spectra (left) for the
first high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) elutes were obtained
in acetonitrile at 25 °C. Theoretical spectra (right) for the Rp enantiomers were obtained at the RI-CC2/def2-TZVPP
level, where the intensities are scaled to 1/3 (top) or 1/5 (bottom).
The excitation energies are red-shifted by 0.2 eV to facilitate direct
comparison with experiment. For the theoretical spectra with different
methods, see Figure S9 in the Supporting
Information.

Table 2 summarizes
the CEs observed for brominated [2.2]paracyclophanes 1–2, where the signs are of the first elutes from
chiral HPLC. As clearly seen, all of these cyclophanes share the common
characteristics, affording the identical CE signs with similar magnitudes
at the closely located excitation wavelengths for all of the bands
A–E. It should be stressed that the CD spectral investigation
of disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes (although limited to the pseudo-metaisomers)
has appeared only recently.30 The CE sign
of the 1Lb band has been correlated with the
absolute configuration of substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes, assigning
negative and positive CEs to Rp and Sp configurations, respectively,31 which is theoretically validated by our calculations. Moreover,
the whole CD spectral pattern was well reproduced by the theoretical
calculation (vide infra), and the absolute configurations of the first
HPLC elutes of all brominated cyclophanes 1–2 were unequivocally assigned to Rp (Figure 1).

A closer look at the experimental
CD spectra (Figure 1) and their g factor profiles (Figure S7 in the Supporting
Information) provided us with additional insights into the planar
chirality of substituted cyclophanes. Although the apparent resemblance
is noted among all of the brominated cyclophanes 1–2, the similarity is much higher between 1 and p-2 (cf. black versus green line in Figure 1) and between m′-2 and o′-2 (red versus blue line). The strength of observed CEs is
slightly more enhanced in p-2 than in 1, except for the band E. In contrast, all CEs, but the band
A, are nearly comparable in strength between m′-2 and o′-2. This chiroptical
behavior seems reasonable, as two exactly the same bromobenzene chromophores
are aligned in the latter pair (m′-2 and o′-2), whereas the facing
chromophore units are not equal to each other in the former pair (1 and p-2; see Chart 2). In the former equal chromophore
pair, the relative orientation of electronic transition moments becomes
nearly identical between the phenes due to the existence of C2 axis. In the latter unequal pair, the enhanced
intensity in p-2 is explained by the
additional bromine substituent introduced to 1. It is
also to stress that the geometrical similarity is not a determining
factor, as the cyclophanes are more resembling between 1 and m′-2 and between p-2 and o′-2 in terms of the twist angle Φ (Table 1). The observed CD spectra, however, are
not simply explained by the conventional excitonic coupling between
the two substituted benzene chromophores.32,33 Due to the effective σ–π interaction with the
bridging linker, the relevant orbitals are degenerated to afford a
more complex mixture of states.34 The cyclophane
band is described by exciton and charge resonance interactions between
the two facing phenes.25,27 Thus, the apparent difference
in the CD shapes of 1 and p-2 and of m′-2 and o′-2 pairs is ascribable to the altered energy
splitting of relevant orbitals due to the different interplanar interaction
between the phenes. It is reasonable that the strengths of CEs in
dibromocyclophanes are always comparable, as the number of bromine
atoms or the steric hindrance derived therefrom is a decisive factor
for the cyclophane structure (i.e., dihedral angle Φ) rather
than the electronic factor. The CE at the cyclophane band was almost
negligible in 1 (Δε = +0.1 M–1 cm–1), which was enhanced to +0.6 M–1 cm–1 for p-2 and o′-2. This was doubled to +1.2 M–1 cm–1 in m′-2, where both the bromine atoms are located adjacent to the
same linker chain, which affects the associated σ–π
interaction more rigorously, leading to the higher anisotropy for
this transition.

Theoretical Investigation
When the theoretical calculation
successfully reproduces the experimental CD, all of the associated
estimates, including geometry, excitation energy, and rotational strength,
are well reproduced in required accuracy. With such a calculation
result, one can also extract a breadth of information regarding the
molecular orbital, electron/charge distribution, energy contribution,
intramolecular interaction, and so on. To better interpret the observed
CD spectra by theory, we employed the approximate second-order coupled
cluster approach and the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme
that combines perturbation theory with configuration interaction,
both combined with the density-fitting procedure. These methods, RI-CC235 and RI-ADC(2)36 methods
for short, have been successfully used recently for reproducing the
CD spectra of various molecular and supramolecular systems.37−43 Practically, these are often the only available options, where simulation
with more familiar time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)
method fails. Indeed, both methods successfully predicted the comparable
spectra for 1 and p-2 and
for m′-2 and o′-2, in nice agreement with the experimental
observations (Figure 1, right, see also Figure S9 in the Supporting
Information). The characteristic pattern in each pair was well predicted
by theory, but the individual (apparent) transition bands were not
reproduced at a level of accuracy that we commonly achieved in other
cases.37,38,43 For a comparison
purpose, we also employed the symmetry-adapted cluster configuration
interaction (SAC-CI)44 method as well as
the cost-efficient TD-DFT45 method with
several representative functionals, including the global and range-separated
hybrid functionals, Becke’s half-and-half nonlocal exchange
combined with the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functionals
(BHLYP),46 the hybrid meta-exchange–correlation
functionals of Truhlar and Zhao (M06-2X),47 and the long-range corrected hybrid exchange–correlation
functional (CAM-B3LYP).48 They all provided
comparable CE patterns with slight deviations in CD intensity and/or
excitation energy at the main bands, except for the cyclophane band
(Figure S9 in the Supporting Information).
A somewhat better performance has been observed with the SAC-CI method
in describing the chirality of a low-energy band of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane,43 but
was not the case in the present systems. Furthermore, the excitation
energies were considerably underestimated by this method. Among three
functionals in the TD-DFT method, the M06-2X method outperformed in
overall reproducibility for all of the cyclophanes examined here,
but in general, the TD-DFT method is not recommended for accurate
prediction of the CD spectra of planar chiral cyclophanes. Nevertheless,
direct comparison of the calculated spectra with the experimental
counterparts allows us to unambiguously determine the absolute configurations
of planar chirality of brominated [2.2]paracyclophanes 1–2 as Rp for the
first HPLC elutes.

Because both the RI-CC2 and RI-ADC(2) provided
essentially the same results and outperformed any of the TD-DFT and
SAC-CI methods, we focus on the results obtained by the RI-CC2/def2-TZVPP
method here (Figure 1, right). For better comparison with the experimental spectra, the
calculated spectra were scaled to 1/3 for 1 and p-2 or to 1/5 for m′-2 and o′-2, typical corrections
frequently employed for other cyclophane systems.18−20 Such scaling
against experiment was always observed in this level of calculation,
and presumably due, at least in part, to the possible ignorance of
molecular dynamic behavior as well as vibronic contributions, but
certainly requires further development in theory.

In the former
pair, bands A and B were properly reproduced for p-2 by theory but not for 1 for
reasons not clear at present. The strong negative CE at band C was
well reproduced, but two transitions predicted by theory were less
separated in energy and were essentially overlapped. Such disagreement
in excitation energy was more apparent for the band D of p-2, which apparently exhibited double maxima in theoretical
spectrum, but overlapped in experiment. The overall performance was
even worse for band E, where transitions are severely overlaid, and
additional peaks were noted in theory. For the latter pair, band A
was slightly overestimated in intensity and band B was not observed
well. Both bands C and D were properly reproduced, but the experimentally
observed energy splitting was not apparent in the theoretical spectra.
For band E, additional peaks were overlaid in theory. It is to note
that such observations were shared by o′-2 and m′-2.

Table 3 numerically
compares the first three low-energy transitions (including the cyclophane
band and the 1Lb transition) of brominated [2.2]paracyclophanes 1–2 calculated by a variety of theoretical
methods. The treatment of these transitions is relatively straightforward
due to the reduced complexity of possible mixing, changed order, and/or
missing transitions, which often complicate the analysis in higher-energy
regions. The very weak positive CE at band A observed for monobromocyclophane 1, however, was not correctly reproduced by any of the examined
calculations, all of which predicted a weak negative CE as the lowest-energy
transition. This may be related to the severely forbidden nature of
this transition, the calculated oscillator strength being far less
than 0.0001, which is in accord with the experimental UV–vis
spectral observation. The relative intensity of CE and the sign of
the cyclophane band (band A) were properly predicted for all of the
dibromocyclophanes by both the RI-CC2 and RI-ADC(2) methods, where
improved oscillator strengths were observed. The TD-DFT method with
M06-2X and CAM-B3LYP functionals afforded better results, at least
the correct signs, but that with the BHLYP functional did not provide
any satisfactory clue. The prediction of band B was most challenging
and generally not well reproduced by any examined methods. The CEs
at band C, which corresponds to the 1Lb transition,
were well reproduced by most of the theories for all cyclophanes 1–2, but the TD-DFT with CAM-B3LYP and
BHLYP functionals considerably underestimated the CE intensity.

a Calculated n-th
excitation energy (En in eV), oscillator
strength (fn), and rotatory strength (Rn) at the RI-CC2/def2-TZVPP, RI-ADC(2)/def2-TZVPP,
SAC-CI/def2-TZVP, or TD-DFT/def2-TZVP level. Excitation energies and
intensities were not shifted or scaled.

The CE in the low-energy region is known to be very
sensitive to
the conformation of cyclophanes, as these transitions are associated
with the states affected by the strong σ–π interaction
of the linker.8 These unsatisfactory theoretical
results would be ascribed at least in part to our failure to include
the parallel-displaced conformer or other minor conformers with various
dihedral angles that are thermally populated across the shallow dihedral-angle
coordinate and/or to the improper estimation through the single-referenced
theoretical ansatz, which is insufficient to describe the complex
transitions with interplanar interaction between phenes with severe
deformation. Thus, further experimental and theoretical investigations
are certainly needed to fully comprehend the chiroptical behavior
of the cyclophane band.

Conclusions
In this study, we investigated
the chiroptical properties of mono-
and dibromo[2.2]paracyclophanes 1–2 experimentally and theoretically. All of the cyclophanes exhibited
a common characteristic pattern of strong Cotton effects in the CD
spectra, owing to their planar chirality. In addition, a weak but
distinctive CE was also observed in the lowest-energy region due to
the interplanar interaction and is assignable to the cyclophane band
characteristic to [2.n]cyclophanes. In-depth analysis
revealed that these cyclophanes can be grouped into two different
families. Thus, the detailed pattern and relative intensity of CEs
are more resembling between cyclophanes 1 and p-2 and between m′-2 and o′-2, which is
attributable not to the subtle differences in cyclophane structure
but to the pattern of bromine substitution.

Theoretical calculations
of the CDs of these cyclophanes were successful
to properly reproduce the characteristic pattern (and the above resemblance)
of the strong CEs in the main bands, which also allowed effective
and unambiguous determination of the absolute configurations of planar
chiral cyclophanes 1–2, i.e., the
enantiomers that elute earlier from Chiralcel IA or IB column are Rp without any exceptions.

In contrast,
predicting CEs of the cyclophane band with a comparable
accuracy turned out to be more challenging, most probably due to the
severe interplanar interaction. The CEs at the cyclophane band calculated
for dibromocyclophanes 2 were reasonable at least in
relative strength, but that for simpler 4-bromo[2.2]paracyclophane 1 was not well reproduced. Despite the relatively simple model
systems exploited for the investigation of planar chirality of cyclophane,
we still encountered the unexpected chiroptical responses for the
most intriguing cyclophane band, i.e., none of the state-of-the-art
theoretical calculations, including RI-CC2, RI-ADC(2), SAC-CI, and
TD-DFT methods, could properly reproduce its chiroptical properties.
This fact urges us to further scrutinize the chiroptical properties
of the cyclophane band both experimentally and theoretically by employing
a wider variety of [2.n]cyclophanes and more accurate
theoretical calculations to comprehend the nature and behavior of
planar chirality.

Materials and Methods
Racemic 4-bromo[2.2]paracyclophane 1 was commercially
available (Strem Chemicals). Racemic dibromo[2.2]paracyclophanes (p-2,49m′-2,50 and o′-250) were prepared
as described in the literature. Optical resolution of each cyclophane
was achieved by chiral HPLC on Chiralcel IA or IB column (Figures S1–S4 in the Supporting Information).
For clarity, the CD spectra of first HPLC elutes are reported and
discussed throughout the work; the absolute configurations of these
cyclophanes were assigned as Rp by comparing
the experimental and theoretical CD spectra (vide infra). Details
of the spectral measurement as well as the computation can be found
in the Supporting Information.
