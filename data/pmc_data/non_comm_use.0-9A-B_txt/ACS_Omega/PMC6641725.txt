1 Introduction
To
meet the requirements of energy storage and conversion, research
efforts have been directed toward rechargeable nonaqueous Li–O2 batteries because of their extremely high theoretical specific
energy of 11 400 Wh kg–1. The energy density
is 5–10 times higher than that of the intercalation cathode
in the conventional lithium-ion batteries, and it is also competitive
to that of gasoline or diesel oil.1,2 However, lots
of challenges still need to be overcome before Li–O2 batteries can find practical applications in electric vehicles,
hybrid vehicles, and stationary energy storage.

Among various
issues, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reaction
is an essential problem resulting in high overpotentials and affecting
the performance of Li–O2 batteries, especially for
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).3,4 The high overpotential
leads to poor round-trip efficiency and cyclability. One promising
way of reducing the overpotentials is to add catalysts for the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) and OER.5−7 Attention has been paid
to explore effective catalysts to improve the energy efficiency of
Li–O2 batteries. Cathode materials have been explored
as effective catalysts in Li–O2 batteries, including
porous carbon materials,8−10 noble metals,11−16 noble metal oxides,17,18 transitional metal oxides,19−24 and perovskite-based25,26 and pyrochlore-based27 compounds. Among those mentioned above, carbon
materials, such as graphene,28,29 carbon nanotubes,30,31 and mesoporous carbon,9 show both high
specific capacity and high ORR activity due to their large specific
area and superior electronic conductivity. However, the OER activity
is insufficient. The noble metal-based materials have been attracting
much attention in this field because of their high activity for both
ORR and OER, but they are too expensive for general use. Thus, the transitional metal oxides
have been developed into promising electrocatalysts for ORR and OER
process because of their low cost and high activity. However, there
is still a huge gap in comparison to noble metals, so a lower overpotential
needs to be achieved by further study. Therefore, exploring new catalysts
to reduce the overpotential and increase the round-trip efficiency
is still an important challenge for Li–O2 batteries.
The transitional metals and their alloys in nanoscale have good electronic
conductivity, which is beneficial for the catalyst synergistic effect
to possess high electrocatalytic activity, and various active sites.
Previous studies have shown that Co32 and
Ni33 nanoparticles have a higher electrocatalytic
activity for OER or ORR. It has been proved that the transition metals
could accelerate the reaction process. The current research also demonstrates
that FeCo/CNT displays excellent electrocatalytic activity during
the OER and ORR processes, which is more superior than that of the
CNTs.34 Similarly, in comparison with the
single metal, FeNi3@C presents superior electrocatalytic
activity in the OER process with water system due to the optimized surface electronic structure as
a result of the introduction of Fe, which also contributed to the
synergistic effect of the alloy.35 All
of these above reports suggest that the transition metal alloys in
nanoscale are promising electrocatalysts in the Li–O2 batteries, as well as other electrocatalytic field.

Moreover, the earth-enriched
element of Fe and Ni were studied
as transition metal alloys to prepare cost-effective electrocatalysts.
Therefore, we have selected two stable structures Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3, which have a higher content of Fe atoms
and synergistic effect. In this work, uniform FexNiy nanospheres, including the
body-centered cubic Fe7Ni3 and the face-centered
cubic FeNi3, were synthesized via a simple solvothermal
method and employed in the Li–O2 battery for the
first time. The FexNiy nanospheres enhanced the performance of the Li–O2 batteries efficiently. In particular, the Fe7Ni3 nanosphere presents a superior performance with a higher
initial discharge capacity of 7266 mAh/gKB and a lower
overpotential during the charge–discharge process, wherein
the voltage gap is reduced by 250 mV compared with that of the Ketjen
Blank (KB) cathode.

2 Results and Discussion
The FexNiy nanospheres were prepared via a facile solvothermal method. During
the slow processes of nucleation and growth, some critical factors
needed to be controlled. First, before the reaction, the mixture must
be continuously stirred to be homogeneous. Simultaneously, the oxygen
of the system was removed by a swift Ar flow for about 5 min. In addition,
the octadecylamine served as a surfactant and was significant for
the reaction. It tended to form a polymer–metal complex prescursor
in the presence of the long-chain organic compounds and restricted
the nucleation and the growth of the crystal nucleus.36−38 The hydrazine hydrate acted as a reductant to reduce Fe3+ and Ni2+ and then formed an alloy in the alkaline system.
The FexNiy nanospheres served as electrocatalysts for Li–O2 batteries, and the Li–O2 batteries performance
were investigated, as shown in Figure 1. The Li–O2 batteries were assembled
with a Li foil serving as an anode and FexNiy nanospheres mixed with KB was employed
as the air cathode; the two ends were separated by a glass fiber filter
separator. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared
samples are presented in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, the XRD results show the diffraction peaks that matched
well with the body-centered cubic Fe7Ni3 phase
(JCPDS 65-7251) and the face-centered cubic FeNi3 phase
(JCPDS 38-0419). Through inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
spectrum (ICP-AES) measurement, the atomic ratios of the two samples
were determined to be 7:3 and 1:3 (Table 1), corresponding to the compositions of Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3, consistent with the XRD
results.

Figure 3 presents
the morphology and structure of Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3 nanospheres analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. A large number
of Fe7Ni3 spherelike secondary particles with
a size of ca. 150 nm are observed in Figure 3a. The TEM and HRTEM images of Fe7Ni3 nanospheres shown in Figures 3b and S1a give
further evidence that the as-prepared secondary particles are composed
of Fe7Ni3 primary nanoparticles with the size
of less than 10 nm. The composition of FeNi3 was similar
to that of Fe7Ni3, but the range of particle
size was different. The HRTEM image for Fe7Ni3 nanospheres shown in Figure 3c confirms the unidirectional fringe pattern and the measured
interlayer spacing of 0.203 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane.
The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
in this region is shown in the inset of Figure 3c, which shows that the clear diffraction
ring can be indexed to the cubic Fe7Ni3(110)
plane. Moreover, element mapping (Figure 3d) showed that Fe
and Ni elements are distributed uniformly, which indicated the formation
of an alloy.13,39 Similarly, FeNi3 spherelike
secondary particles with a size of ca. 200 nm consisted of primary
particles (Figure 3e,f) with the size of less than 10 nm (Figure S1b). The interlayer spacings were 0.208 and 0.180 nm, corresponding
to (111) and (200) planes, respectively, corresponding to the two
clear diffraction rings shown in the inset of Figure 3g. The elemental mapping images shown in Figure 3h offer the evidence
for the existence of FeNi3 alloy.39

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to further
distinguish the formation of Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3 alloys, whose spectra are illustrated in Figure 4. The peaks imply the presence
of iron (Fe 2p), nickel (Ni 2p), and oxygen (O 1s) coming from Fe7Ni3, FeNi3, and some surface oxide of
the alloys. The peaks shown in the spectra of Fe at 706.7 and 706.5
eV are attributed to the Fe 2p of metallic Fe, which indicates the
presence of a zero-valent Fe.39−41 Peaks at 710.2 and 710.7 eV are
attributed to Fe3+.39 Peaks
at 852.0 and 852.6 eV for Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3 indicate the existence of a zero-valent Ni.42,43 Peaks at 855.1 and 855.4 in Figure 4c,f, respectively, are assigned to Ni2+.39 These results suggest a large amount of Fe and
Ni on the surface of the as-prepared FexNiy nanospheres. The oxides were formed
due to exposure of the active metal nanoparticles to air, which caused
the surface oxidation. Combining the XPS and XRD results, we can prove
that FexNiy alloys were formed rather than the individual metals of Fe and Ni.44

The FexNiy nanospoheres generally reveal a higher electrical conductivity
than
metal oxides, which could decrease the resistance and facilitate the
transfer of electrons in the oxygen cathodes. Besides, the size of
the as-prepared samples is tiny which is endowed with large surface
area, resulting in abundant active sites in catalytic reactions. Therefore,
these FexNiy nanospheres are promising electrocatalysts for Li–O2 batteries, and their performance is being further studied. To prove
the electrocatalytic activity of the FexNiy nanospheres, they were assembled
as the oxygen electrode in Li–O2 batteries. For
a comparison, the pure Ketjen Blank (KB) electrode was used in the
same conditions. Figure 5a displays the discharge–charge curves of the electrodes of
KB, Fe7Ni3 (KB + Fe7Ni3 nanospheres), and FeNi3 (KB + FeNi3 nanospheres)
at the current density of 150 mA/gKB. Fe7Ni3 nanospheres showed the best electrochemical property. The
discharge plateau of Fe7Ni3 electrode was 2.72
V, 50 mV than that of KB (2.67 V) and 50 mV more than that of FeNi3 (2.67 V) electrodes, which indicated that Fe7Ni3 nanospheres can efficiently facilitate the ORR activity in
the Li–O2 batteries. As for the charge process,
the plateau of Fe7Ni3 electrode was about 200
mV lower than that of pure KB electrode. In addition, Fe7Ni3 electrode showed about 180 mV lower charge plateau
than FeNi3 electrode. Fe7Ni3 electrode
exhibited a high round-trip efficiency of 63.8%, which was higher
than that of FeNi3 electrode (60.0%) and KB electrode (59.8%),
indicating a higher energy density than what could be reached by Fe7Ni3 electrode.45 It
suggested that Fe7Ni3 had more efficient active
sites than FeNi3 for the OER process. As seen from Figure 5a, the initial specific
discharge capacity of Fe7Ni3, FeNi3, and KB electrode is 7608, 5507, and 5487 mAh/gKB, respectively.
The corresponding coulombic efficiency of Fe7Ni3, FeNi3, and KB electrodes was 95.5, 80.6, and 44.6%,
which indicated a high reversibility of Fe7Ni3 electrode.38 All of these results demonstrated
that Fe7Ni3 nanospheres can reduce the discharge–charge
overpotential and increase the specific capacity of the Li–O2 batteries to a great extent. To avoid serious polarization
of the electrode during the discharge process, the cycle stability
of the FexNiy electrodes was tested under a capacity-limited strategy of 1000
mAh/gKB and a current density of 150 mA/gKB.
As shown in Figure 5b, Fe7Ni3 electrode can remain discharged with
no decay after 15 cycles, whereas FeNi3 electrode only
operated for 10 cycles during the capacity-limited cycle test. This
result proved that Fe7Ni3 electrode exhibited
better performance with more number of cycles. The details of the
discharge–charge curves for the FexNiy nanospheres are illustrated in Figure 6. The correlation
between the discharge-medium voltage and the cycle numbers is presented
in Figure 5b. The discharge-medium
voltage was reduced with increasing cycle numbers, indicating the
overpotential was generally enhanced, which could be caused by the
increased impedance of the Li–O2 batteries after cycling Figure 7.45 In rechargeable Li–O2 batteries,
the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 were
the dominant reactions during discharge and charge processes. Simultaneously,
some byproducts were formed due to the reaction of electrolyte or
carbon materials. Undesirable byproducts, such as Li2CO3, cannot be decomposed completely during the charge process
and were accumulated on the air electrode after cycling and finally resulted in
an increase in the overpotential.45,46 In addition,
the electrocatalytic activity of OER was the significant factor to
affect the overpotential and the charge capacity. The linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) of OER and chronoamperometry profiles were measured
after the discharge capacity depth of 1000 mAh g–1 (Figure 8) and in
the Li–O2 battery with the Li2O2 cathode (Figure S2), respectively. As
shown in Figure 8a,
it is obvious that the current density of Fe7Ni3 is higher than that of FeNi3 electrode, which corresponded
with Figure S2a (a lower potential of oxidation
and a higher current density), indicating a higher electrocatalytic
acitivty of Fe7Ni3 electrode.38Figure 8b presents the chronoamperometry profiles of Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3, which was used to investigate the OER
kinetics. The current density of FeNi3 electrode was lower
than that of Fe7Ni3 electrode at the potential
of 4.0 V, corresponding with the result of Figure S2b (a lower current density of 0.05 mA cm–2), implying a fast kinetics process for OER on Fe7Ni3 electrode.47 On the basis of these
results, the possibility of the capacity decade was related with the
OER activity, which corresponded with the discharge–charge
profiles (Figure 5a).

As we all know, the generally accepted mechanism
of the Li–O2 battery during the discharge process
is that O2 undergoes a one-electron reduction to form LiO2 as an
intermediate, which is adsorbed on the electrocatalyst. Due to the
different adsorption energy, the LiO2 displays evident
selective adsorption on special crystal planes of electrocatalysts.
LiO2 with an oxygen-rich surface is beneficial to the formation
of Li2O2. Simultaneously, after continuously
charging to 4.5 V, the discharge product is decomposed completely.48,49 However, in this work, the battery operated through a different
process in which LiO2 was the main product of the discharge.
To investigate the mechanism of the reaction process, the Raman spectra
were employed to detect the intermediate product. Figure 7 illustrates the Raman spectra
of Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3 cathodes at different
states, including discharge to 2.6 V, discharge to 2.0 V, and charge
to 4.5 V. Figure 7a–e
shows the Raman spectra for Fe7Ni3. Figure 7a,b demonstrates
the presence of peaks at 1123 and 1505 cm–1, which
is associated with the formation of LiO2. The peak at 1123
cm–1 was a signature of the LiO2-like
component. The peak at 1505 cm–1 was attributed
to the distortion of the graphite ring stretching model, which is
a consequence of the strong interaction between LiO2 and
graphite carbon surface.15,50−52 There was a weak peak at about 820 cm–1 in Figure 7b, which could be
ascribed to Li2O2. The typical peak of the commercial
Li2O2 was appropriately 790 cm–1, which was lower than that given in this work. We and other authors
suspected that the electrochemically formed Li2O2 differed from the commercial Li2O2, resulting
from the interactions with the FexNiy and graphite carbon surface.49,53,54 The relatively intensity of LiO2 was much higher than that of Li2O2, which
indicated that LiO2 was the dominant product. After continuously
charging at 4.5 V, the peaks of Li2O2 and LiO2 disappeared, indicating the decomposition of Li2O2 and LiO2. The similar results were observed
for FeNi3 cathode in the discharge–charge process.
Thus, the FexNiy nanospheres tended to catalyze the formation of LiO2,
which could increase the battery life.

The morphology of the
FexNiy electrodes
at different states was characterized
by ex situ SEM. As shown in Figure 7b, the first discharged Fe7Ni3 electrode seemed like a ball-like composite with a diameter of approximately
1 μm packed on the electrode. The product disappeared and the
electrode surface recovered the same as the fresh one (Figure 7a) after the battery was recharged
(Figure 7c), indicating
Fe7Ni3 electrode has good reversibility over
cycling. The discharged product was further investigated by ex situ
XRD. The weak diffraction peaks at 32.9, 34.9, and 58.7° (magnified
in the inset in Figure 9g) corresponded
to Li2O2 (JCPDS 74-0115) and little Li2CO3 that appeared after the first discharge process. In
addition, no obvious diffraction peaks of LiO2 were detected
by XRD measurement due to the amorphous nature of the discharge products.51 As for FeNi3 electrode, there was
no evident difference at different states in comparison to Fe7Ni3 electrode at different states. The first charged
electrode of FeNi3 seemed blurry. It suggested that some
product was decomposed incompletely or some byproducts cannot be decomposed
on the surface of the electrode. This result was coincident with the
different performance, including the reversibility and overpotentials,
between Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3 electrodes
in discharge–charge curves. In this work, Fe7Ni3 cathode presents a higher specific capacity and a lower overpotential,
especially in the OER process. Previous researches reported that increasing
the mass of Fe in alloy enhanced the OER process, which was attributed
to the optimized electronic structure due to the introduction of Fe.35,42,55 It endowed the active sites with
appropriate adsorption energy, which benefited LiO2 adsorption
in the ORR process and improved LiO2 desorption in the
OER process. Fe7Ni3 and FeNi3 electrodes
exhibited big difference in the performances. Therefore, this result
may be caused by the mass of Fe, which could optimize the electron
structure of the material surface.35

3 Conclusions
In summary,
body-centered cubic Fe7Ni3 and
face-centered cubic FeNi3 nanospheres were successfully
synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. Fe7Ni3 nanospheres exhibited a much higher activity and durability
than FeNi3 nanospheres and served as electrocatalysts for
nonaqueous rechargeable Li–O2 batteries. Significantly,
the FexNiy nanospheres employed as electrocatalysts tend to change the discharge
products in nature, differing from other transition metal electrocatalysts.
This work would provide a new perspective for transition metals electrocatalysts
in Li–O2 batteries and broaden the scope for future
research.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation
of FexNiy Nanospheres
KOH (1 g) and
octadecylamine (2 g) were added into 35 mL N-methyl-pyrrolidone,
and then the certain amounts of iron(III) acetylacetonate and nickel(II)
acetylacetonate were added successively with continuous stirring.
When the solution became homogeneous, the mixture was transferred
to a Teflon-lined autoclave followed by adding 5 mL hydrazine hydrate
and removing the air by Ar flow for about 5 min. Then, the autoclave
was treated at a temperature of 180 °C in an electric oven for
2 h to produce FexNiy nanospheres. Finally, the products were obtained by centrifuging
at 12 000 rpm. The as-prepared samples were washed alternately
several times with n-hexane, acetone, and dried at
40 °C under vacuum.

4.2 Characterization
The crystalline
structures of the as-synthesized samples were analyzed by X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) using a Phillips X’pert Pro MPD diffractometer
(Cu Kα, λ = 1.54056 Å). The size distribution and
morphology of the products were characterized by a field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, acceleration voltage of 5 kV,
S-4800, Hitachi) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM, an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, JEM-2010, JEOL). The compositions
of the as-prepared samples were investigated by inductively coupled
plasma-atomic emission spectrum (ICP-AES, Jarrel-ASH, ICAP-9000).
The surface composition of the samples were characterized by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher) with Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source for
excitation.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
air electrode was assembled in the composition of FexNiy nanospheres 45 wt %, Ketjen
Black (KB) 45 wt %, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder 10
wt %. The pure KB electrode consisted of KB 90 wt % and PVDF 10 wt
%. N-Methyl-pyrrolidone was added to the powder mixture
to make a uniform slurry. Then, the slurry was pasted on the carbon
papers and dried at 80 °C overnight in a vacuum oven to form
air electrodes. Each of the composite electrode paste was ca. 0.8
mg. In comparison, the KB electrode was ca. 0.4 mg. Electrochemical
measurements were carried out in CR2032 coin cells with holes to allow
O2 diffusion. The coin cells consisted of a Li foil anode,
a glass fiber filter separator, an electrolyte (1 M LiTFSI-TEGDME)
and air electrode, were assembled in an Argon-filled glove box with
water and oxygen levels less than 0.5 ppm. Galvanostatic discharge–charge
measurements were carried out on a Neware battery test system, and
the current density and specific capacity was calculated based on
the amount of KB. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry
were measured on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium IM6 station)
after discharge at the depth of 1000 mAh g–1.
