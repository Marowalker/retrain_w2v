A highly efficient and convenient
one-pot sonochemical synthetic
strategy has been sophisticated for synthesizing a novel class of
polysubstituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines via [3 +
2] cycloaddition of dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates, ethyl propiolate,
and alkenes to 2-imino-1H-pyridin-1-amines under
catalyst-free conditions. A series of uniquely substituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines has been synthesized with a very good to excellent
yield, and the mechanistic pathway that involves a [3 + 2] annulation
process was also proposed. In this study, several spectroscopic tools
of analyses were employed for structure elucidation, and the X-ray
single-crystal technique was utilized to confirm the proposed mechanism
and the regioselectivity.

Introduction
The pyrazolopyridine
derivatives and their analogues represent
a remarkable category among the pharmaceutically active compounds,
for example, the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine heterocyclic
system, which was found as a part of the skeletal backbone of many
therapeutic drugs today.1 This class of
compounds has various pharmacological and biological activities including
antiplatelet,2 melatonin receptor agonist,3 antipsychotic, antiherpetic,4 and a D4 and D3 receptor antagonist and agonist.5 Consequently, they are applicable in the treatment
of several neurological disorders including anxiety, schizophrenia,
attention deficit disorder, drug dependency, and Parkinson’s
disease.5−7 Moreover, members of this family like the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivative 1 (Figure 1) has been shown to serve as a potent and
selective 5HT3 antagonist, which has been clinically applied to treat
vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy.8 In addition, pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives 2 and 3 (Figure 1) are adenosine A1 receptor antagonists with potent
diuretic activity.9,10

derivatives 1–3.

As a result of these interesting characteristics and applications,
the fused pyridine derivatives are of notable structures; consequently,
they have attracted continuing attention of the synthetic organic
chemists and pharmaceutical industry. Recently, numerous protocols
have been evaluated for the synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines; the most common and popular route involves the intermolecular
cyclization reactions of N-iminopyridinium ylides
with a dipolarophile like alkynes and alkenes.2,11−17 Moreover the intramolecular rearrangement reactions have also given
rise to the formation of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
derivatives, for example, the intramolecular cyclization of ethynylpyridines18,19 and transient nitrenes.20,21 Recently, in our laboratory,
we developed various protocols for synthesizing the pyridine derivatives
and their utility as valuable precursors to synthesize a novel pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine derivatives through a new distinctive [4 + 1]
cycloaddition process.22,23 In a commitment of our research
aimed at developing new approaches for polyfunctionally substituted
pyrazolopyridines, this investigation was aimed to develop a novel
route for polysubstituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines
via [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of acetylenedicarboxylate, ethyl
propiolate, and alkenes to 2-imino-1H-pyridin-1-amines
under catalyst-free conditions via a sonochemical approch. Herein,
the X-ray single-crystal technique was utilized as a distinctive tool
of analysis for structure elucidation and to confirm the proposed
mechanism and the regioselectivity for the reaction products.

Results
and Discussion
The synthetic strategy of our study to obtain
the targeted polysubstituted
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine compounds begins by preparing
the starting material 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine
derivatives 3a–g. These were synthesized
in two sequential steps: (i) the reaction of the arylethylidenemalononitriles 1a–g with DMF-DMA (dimethylformamide dimethyl
acetal) afforded the enaminonitriles 2a–g then (ii) the reaction of the latter with hydrazine hydrate
in refluxing ethanol obtained the enamines (cf. Scheme 1 and Figure 2).

Now, the utlity of 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine
derivatives 3 as valuable precursors for synthesizing
novel uniquely substituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
derivatives will be investigated to explore the limitations and opportunity
of this conversion. However, to the best of our knowledge and after
an extensive literature survey, it was noted that this is the first
synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine from the 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine derivatives 3, and the
synthetic route for the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines
involving the asymmetric N-aminopyridine salts has
some disadvantages like having poor yields and lacking regioselectivity,
since it is usually accompanied by the formation of unfavorable two
regioisomers.2,11 Thus, in this study, we try to
overcome these synthetic drawbacks by selecting the asymmetric 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imines as a novel precursor for synthesizing
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives as a regioselective
product with high yield. The first stage in this study was aimed to
explore a general protocol and establish the best reaction conditions
for the synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives
via an eco-friendly green synthetic methodology. Thus, the reaction
of an equimolar mixture of 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine
derivative (3a) and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD)
(4a) was selected as a model reaction; intially, this
reaction was examined in the presence of different types of solvents
without any addition of a catalyst or additive. In the beginning,
the reaction between 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine
derivative (3a) (5 mmol) and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate
(4a) (5 mmol) was conducted in ethanol (25 mL) under
both thermal heating and sonication at (85 °C) to study the effect
of an energy source on this model reaction. This reaction generates
a novel single product in 54% yield under conventional heating and
69% under sonication, and the results are outlined in Table 1 (entries 1 and 2). The structure
of this product was assigned as 7-amino-6-cyano-5-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (5a) and not pyrido[1,2-b]1,2,4-triazine 6 (Scheme 2) on the
basis of the data obtained from diversified spectrometric tools. The 1H NMR data of the obtained product in DMSO exhibited two singlet
signals at δ 8.48 ppm for NH2 protons and δ
7.18 ppm for pyridine hydrogen (H4), and the two methyl groups of
the two ester groups manifested as two singlets at δ 3.95 and
3.81 ppm, respectively, in addition to the aromatic protons signals
at δ 7.52–7.62 ppm. Moreover, all the data obtained from 13C NMR, IR, and mass and accurate mass determination support
the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine structure. This structure
was definitely confirmed via X-ray single crystallography for some
representative examples as shown later (cf. Figures 3–6). Then, we applied different solvents to
conduct the above model reaction like methanol, acetonitrile, propanol,
isopropanol, dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide,
water, and toluene. The obtained results for this solvent screening
study showed that acetonitrile is the most efficacious solvent for
conducting this reaction (70% yield under conventional heating and
92% under sonication), in comparison with the other used solvents
as illustrated in Table 1 ( entries 3–18). Furthermore, improvement was noted in both
the reaction yield and rate when this model reaction was carried out
under sonication (at 85 °C, 110 W) as a substitutional energy
source. The use of ultrasonic irradiation along with thermal activation
for conducting chemical reactions in solution has many specifications
like increasing and improving the reactivities and reaction rate in
a dramatic way, which proceeds by the generation, growth, and collapse
of acoustic bubbles in the reaction mixture. These directly help in
decreasing the reaction time and considerably improve the reaction
yield.24−26 Meanwhile, to check the effect of the catalyst on
the outcome of the above model reaction, we first conducted this reaction
in the presence 10 mol % of palladium(II) acetate Pd(OAc)2, utlizing the most effective solvent acetonitrile. The results summarized
in Table 1 (entries
19 and 20) showed that the obtained yields, either thermally or under
sonication, are very close to the results obtained without using the
catalytic agent. Moreover, the same reaction was conducted using Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst but also had a moderate effect on this reaction,
since the obtained yields were almost the same. This means that the
catalyst has no effect on the reaction yield.

a Reaction conditions: 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine derivatives (3a) (5 mmol),
dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (4a) (5 mmol), solvent

was 85 °C at 110 W).

b NR, no reaction.

With the
optimized set of the reaction conditions in our hand,
we were enthusiastic to explore the scope and limitations of the abovementioned
reaction. Moreover, in order to investigate the scalable synthetic
approach of this reaction, we conducted the reaction using 10 mmol
of each starting material instead of 5 mmol. Thus, the reactions of
an equimolar mixture of 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine
derivatives (3a–g) and acetylene
derivatives like dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (4a),
diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (4b), and ethyl propiolate
(4c) in refluxing acetonitrile only without any additives
were scrutinized thermally and under ultrasonic irradiation to compare
the reaction yields. The outlined data depicted in Scheme 3 showed that all the above
suggested interactions gave the same reaction output in excellent
yields via ultrasonic irradiation, which evidenced to be the corresponding
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives 5a–s (cf. Scheme 3). All the proposed pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine structures for the reaction products have been confirmed
based on various tools of spectrometric analysis, such as 1H NMR and 13C NMR, in addition to the mass and accurate
mass assignment. Moreover, the above structure was assured without
any doubt through the X-ray single-crystal structure determination
in some representative examples (cf. Figures 3–6).

Scheme 3 Reaction
of 1-Amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine Derivatives
(3) with Acetylenedicarboxylate 4
A conceivable mechanistic pathway
for the synthesis of 5a–s was proposed
as a concerted [3 + 2] annulation
process as outlined in Scheme 3. First, in this route, the exocyclic amino group in the 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine derivatives (3) underwent
Michael-type addition to the acetylenedicarboxylate derivatives 4 in a domino-like pathway to yield the congruent nonseparated
cyclic intermediate 6, which was then converted to the
corresponding intermediate 7 by means of 1,4-hydrogen
shift; eventually, the intermediate 7 underwent aromatization
through losing one hydrogen molecule to form the corresponding pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines 5 (cf. Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Mechanistic Pathway for the Formation
of Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines 5
Now, we will test the reaction
of the abovementioned 1-aminopyridine-2-imine
derivatives 3a–g with ethyl acrylate (8) as a representative example of an alkene. Thus, reacting an equimolar
ratio from 1-aminopyridine-2-imine derivatives 3a–g with ethyl acrylate (8) in acetonitrile without
any additives leads to the formation of compounds with structures
assigned as pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridines 5m–s based on various spectrometric analyses, which
is the same product that was obtained from the reaction of ethyl propiolate.
During the course of this reaction, it is believed that the intermediate 9 has been first formed through the cycloaddition of aminopyridine 3 with ethyl acrylate (8), which underwent losing
two molecules of hydrogen to furnish the final product pyrazolopyridines 5 (cf. Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Reaction of 1-Aminopyridine-2-imine Derivatives 3 with
Ethyl Acrylate (8)
In order to confirm the above mechanistic sequence and
to prove
that the 1,4-hydrogen shift step occurred before the aromatization
by losing hydrogen, we endeavored to isolate one of the above intermediates
by using various examples of alkynes and alkenes, and finally we succeeded
to isolate the intermediate of type 9. Therefore, reacting
of the aminopyridine 3d with acrylonitrile 10 afforded the corresponding tetrahydropyrazolopyridine derivative 11, and the structure of this tetrahydro product was exclusively
evidenced via the X-ray single-crystal analysis as shown in Figure 7. Then, the tetrahydropyrazolopyridine
derivative 11 was successfully converted to the corresponding
pyrazolopyridine derivative 12 via boiling in dimethylformamide
(DMF) (cf. Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Reaction of 1-Aminopyridine-2-imine 3d with Acrylonitrile 10
The obtained pyrazolopyridine 5 was found
as a versatile
substrate for synthesizing a novel and uniquely substituted tricyclic
system pyrazolo[2′,3′:1,6]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine by condensing pyrazolopyridines 5i and 5p with N,N-dimethylformamide
dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) to afford the corresponding amidine derivatives 13, which underwent heterocyclization with the cyano moiety
upon boiling in acetic acid containing ammonium acetate to afford
the corresponding pyrazolo[2′,3′:1,6]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 14 (cf. Scheme 7).

Conclusions
In the abovementioned
study, a convenient novel sonochemical synthetic
strategy for multisubstituted pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
derivatives has been explored through the reaction of 1-amino-2(1H)-pyridine-2-imine derivatives 3a–g with dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate or alkenyl derivatives.
This synthetic route has more inherent merits like high regioselectivity
and yields, in comparison to the aforementioned procedures, which
used asymmetric N-aminopyridines that gave two regioisomers
with poor selectivity and yields. The X-ray crystallography was successfully
utilized in this research for affirmation of the regioselectivity
and the [3 + 2] cycloaddition mechanism.

Experimental Section
General
Melting points were recorded on a Griffin melting
point apparatus and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded using
KBr disks using Jasco FT-IR-6300 spectrophotometer. 1H
NMR (400 MHz) or (600 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) or (150
MHz) spectra were recorded at 25 °C using DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 as a solvent with TMS as internal
standard on a Bruker DPX 400 or 600 superconducting NMR spectrometer.
Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm). Low-resolution
electron impact mass spectra [MS (EI)] and high-resolution electron
impact mass spectra [HRMS (EI)] were performed using a high-resolution
GC-MS (DFS) thermospectrometer at 70.1 eV and a magnetic sector mass
analyzer. Follow up of the reactions and checking the homogeneity
of the prepared compounds were made by using thin-layer chromatography
(TLC). The X-ray crystal structures were determined by using a Rigaku
R-AXIS RAPID diffractometer and Bruker X8 Prospector, and the collection
of single-crystal data was made at room temperature by using Cu Kα
radiation. The structures were solved by using direct methods and
expanded using Fourier techniques. The nonhydrogen atoms were refined
anisotropically. The structures were solved and refined using the
Bruker SHELXTL software package (structure solution program SHELXS-97
and refinement program SHELXL-97).27 Data
were corrected for the absorption effects using the multiscan method
(SADABS). Sonication was performed in MKC6, Guyson ultrasonic bath
(model MKC6, operating frequency of 38 kHz ± 10%, and an output
power of 110 W). The arylethylidenemalononitriles 1a–g28 and enaminonitriles 2a–g29 were prepared
according to the literature procedures.

General Procedure for the
Preparation of 1-Amino-2-imino-4-aryl-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitrile 3a–g
An equimolar mixture of
the enaminonitriles 2a–g (20 mmol)
and hydrazine hydrate (1.5 mL, 30 mmol) in 60 mL of ethanol was refluxed
for 1 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo, and the residual
solid was crystallized from the appropriate solvent to give 3a–g as pure products.

General Procedure
for the Preparation of the Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Derivatives 5a–s
Independent
mixtures of 1-amino-2-iminopyridine derivatives 3a–g (10 mmol) and the appropriate acetylene derivatives 4a-c (10 mmol) in acetonitrile (30 mL) were heated at the
refluxing temperature for 3 h or sonicated for 20 min at 85 °C,
and the reaction was followed up by TLC. The mixtures were cooled
to room temperature. The solid products that formed were filtered
off, washed with ethanol, dried, and recrystallized from the indicated
solvents to give 5a–s as pure products.
The reported yields here are from the sonication procedure.
