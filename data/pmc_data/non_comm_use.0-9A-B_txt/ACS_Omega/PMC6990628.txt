Our previous experimental study showed that Na+-exchanged
coal prepared from low-cost natural soda ash is an excellent catalyst
for steam gasification of low-rank coals using fixed-bed quartz reactors.
However, it is difficult to experimentally clarify the effect of Na
ion exchange on low-rank coal. In order to investigate the influence
of Na+ ions on low-rank coal, this study determined the
electronic state between the Na+-exchanged coal model and
raw coal model and compared them using RHF/6-311G* and B3LYP/6-31G*.
The experiments revealed that Na ion exchange has a significant effect
on low-rank coal gasification. The model structure of low-rank coal
is considered to change significantly in terms of the electronic state
before and after Na exchange even with a simple main molecular structure.
Molecular models where H of COOH/OH was ion-exchanged with one, two,
and three Na ions were developed, and quantum chemical calculations
were performed. The results showed that when the number of Na+-exchanged sites is increased, the electron state on the coal
molecule becomes more negatively charged in the case of the Na+-exchange coal model. It is presumed that this contributes
to enhancing the reactivity of low-rank coal and water vapor. In addition,
weak bonds in the Na+-exchanged coal molecule were examined
by calculating the difference in the value of the Mulliken and Löwdin
bond orders before and after Na+ exchange. The results
showed that the increase in the number of exchanged Na+ in the low-rank coal molecule model increased the number of weak
bonds in the molecule. It is presumed that this contributes to enhancing
the decomposition of low-rank coal.

Introduction
Coal
combustion accounts for about a fourth of the total world
energy consumption, and coal plays an important role in satisfying
the world’s primary energy demand.1 However, at the current rate of annual use, global coal deposits
will last for about 150 years.2 One means
of reducing coal consumption is improving the utilization efficiency
of heat obtained from coal. To achieve this aim, various technologies,
such as supercritical thermal power generation, integrated gasification
combined cycle, and polygeneration, have been developed. The use of
low-rank coal (brown coal), a potentially abundant resource, is also
important for establishing stable energy supply in the future. Nevertheless,
at present, the use of low-rank coal as energy source has few advantages
because of high production costs. Low-rank coal is generally characterized
by a high volatile component and moisture content and low ignition
temperature. In addition, low-rank coal has a higher oxygen content
(15–30%) in oxygen-containing functional groups than high-rank
coal does.3 Therefore, since low-rank coal
tends to adsorb moisture, a large amount of energy is required to
remove it.4

Accordingly, several
attempts have been made to overcome this limitation.
For example, the Strategic Technical Platform for Clean Coal Technology
in Japan has aimed to achieve low-rank coal gasification at 900 °C
or less using a catalyst. To achieve this aim, many studies have been
conducted on the use of Ni or K carbonate catalysts in the gasification
of low-rank coal.5−7 As an example, gasification at 600 °C using
Ni-supported Yallourn low-rank coal with a fluid bed reactor yielded
high conversion rates (≥80 wt %).8 K catalysts also have excellent gasification properties, and Exxon
has developed a pilot-scale fluidized-bed coal gasifier operating
at 3 MPa and 700 °C using steam or H2 with K catalysts.9,10 However, this process has been shown to produce methane-rich products,
and no commercially viable gasification catalysts have been developed
hitherto.

Numerous studies have attempted to understand the
chemical structure
of coal to gasify coal. Mathews and Chaffee11 summarized the structures of many types of coal. Quantum chemical
calculations of coal regarding the interaction between steam and benzene
rings have been conducted, and C=O–K bonds in the benzene
ring have been analyzed, completely neglecting differential overlap.12 Many studies have also investigated the interaction
between water and coal through computer simulations.13−16 However, the influence of substituting H with Na in carboxyl or
hydroxyl groups on the structure of low-rank coal has not been studied.

In a previous study, our group found that Na+ ion exchange
of H in Austrian Loy Yang (LY) low-rank coal and Indonesian Adaro
(AD) bituminous coal-promoted gasification.17 In particular, the samples used mainly had particle sizes of 250–500
μm, and ion exchange was performed at room temperature using
natural soda ash powder (Na2CO3 > 99%) produced
in the United States; a gasification test was also performed. Na+ was exchanged into LY and AD using the natural soda ash powder.
According to the results, 2.7 mass % Na+-exchanged LY and
1.6 mass % Na+-exchanged AD were obtained. Table 1 presents char conversion during
gasification after 1 and 2 h at 700 °C. The conversion was about
15–20% after 2 h irrespective of the coal type, but with the
addition of Na+, the conversion of LY reached approximately
100% after 1 h, and that of AD also increased to 75%. As described
above, our group clarified that Na+-exchanged coal remarkably
promoted steam gasification.

However, many other studies have only experimentally
shown that
these additives are effective for coal gasification. The effect of
Na catalyst ion exchange on the structure of coal has not been clarified.
Since the reaction between water molecules and low-rank coal occurs
at 700 °C, low-rank coal may decompose and react with water molecules.
Consequently, determining the decomposition reaction between water
molecules and low-rank coal via quantum chemical calculations involves
many uncertainties, and the effect of Na addition has not been accurately
evaluated. Therefore, this study focused on changes in the electronic
state of low-rank coal before and after ion exchange and performed
quantum chemistry calculations.

In this study, we used a molecular
model based on analytical values
of Yallourn low-rank coal (Australia), which is a typical structure
of low-rank coal, and analyzed using the molecular orbital method.18 The chemical structure of Yallourn low-rank
coal has been discussed in detail, and other researchers have used
it for molecular dynamics calculations.19 In addition, low-rank coal has a smaller number of atoms and smaller
molecular weight than bituminous coal, no large aromatic ring structure,
and a unique minimum unit structure. Therefore, examining the interaction
with the additive based on the minimum unit structure is significant
because it can simplify the characterization of low-rank coal. In
addition, the electronic state of Na+ ion-exchanged low-rank
coal is considered to change before the gasification reaction. It
is believed that changes in the electronic state facilitate reaction
and promote gasification. Therefore, if changes in the electronic
state and bond order during the exchange of H+ and Na+ in COOH and OH groups of simple low-rank coal are investigated,
the influence of Na+ on low-rank coal molecules can be
determined. Accordingly, this study extends the potential to the search
for additional coal gasification catalysts and discovery of more catalyst
species.

Results and Discussion
Structure of low-rank coal used in the calculation
and substitution
position of Na+
In the gasification of low-rank
coal, experimental results show that gasification is promoted by ion
exchange of the COOH group or OH group with an alkali metal, alkaline
earth metal, or the like.17,20 Therefore, we adopted
a molecular model constructed based on the analytical values of a
typical low-rank coal, namely, Yallourn low-rank coal. The unit structure
of the low-rank coal used for the calculations is shown in Figure 1. The ends of the
bond were capped with hydrogen atoms without nitrogen and sulfur.
Several possible combinations of reactions between Na+ and
the COOH and/or OH groups of the Yallourn coal model structure exist,
and all combinations are shown in Figure 2. Therefore, molecular orbital calculations
were performed on structures with one (Na-1, Na-2, Na-3), two (2Na-1,
2Na-2, 2Na-3), and three Na ions exchanged (3Na) per Yallourn coal
model structure (Figure 2).

and location of sodium exchange for low-rank coal.

Structure and total energy after structure optimization
Each structure substituted by Na+ was optimized, the most
stable structure with the lowest energy and the same substitution
number of Na+ were extracted, and their energies were compared. Figure 3 shows the calculation
results using the restricted Hartree–Fock method (RHF)/6-311G*,
and Figure 4 shows
those using Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP)/6-31G*
considering the interactions between electrons. According to the calculated
total energies, structures with Na+ ions reacting with
carboxyl groups were stable. The structure in which H in a COOH group
was ion-exchanged with Na was found to be the most stable regardless
of the number of Na. A previous study using infrared spectroscopy
confirmed that the Ca2+ ion reacted with a carboxyl group.20 Therefore, this calculation result could be
considered as correct. Furthermore, in the model with the substitution
of 1, 2, and 3 Na ions, the electronic and bonding states were examined
only for the structure in which H in the COOH group was ion-exchanged.
These structures with the lowest total energies were compared using
electrostatic potential maps.

using RHF/6-311G*.

Figure 4 Relationship between
the number of Na+ and total energy
using B3LYP/6-31G*.

Next, the electrostatic
potential was superimposed on the structure
of each low-rank coal. Figures 5 and 6 show the calculation results
using RHF/6-311G* and B3LYP/6-31G*, respectively. The electrostatic
potential map showed the interaction energy, which the positive charge
of unit electric quantity exerted on the electron distribution of
the molecule. It indicated the electrostatic potential at various
points on an electron density surface corresponding to the overall
molecular size. The map was used to determine the polar area of the
Na+-exchanged structures, encompassing the area of the
electron density surface where the electrostatic potential is indicated
in red (large negative values of potential) or blue (large positive
values of potential).21 Comparing the low-rank
coal before and after Na+ exchange, the Na+-exchanged
structure was found to be in the form of a horizontally elongated
rod. The interaction of Na with the opposite O atom was found to stabilize
the shape of the rod. Therefore, this part is blue when Na+ exchange increased. Furthermore, this part of the benzene ring is
indicated in red. That is, the positive charge accumulated in this
Na+ portion, and the negative charge was pushed out to
the benzene ring. In the case of low-rank coal without ion exchange,
the oxygen atom portion was negatively charged, and the electron state
was not charged in the benzene ring portion. In addition, the charge
of the benzene ring gradually became more negative in the case of
two or three Na substitutions. This suggested an enhancement of the
reactivity of the basic structure of low-rank coal, and Na+-exchanged low-rank coal is considered to react with molecules, such
as water vapor, during gasification to promote decomposition. It is
presumed that decomposition due to gasification was likely to occur
by increasing the Na+ ion exchange. In fact, although different
types of coal were used in the experiment, the gasification of 2.7
mass % LY coal was higher than that of 1.6 mass % AD coal (Table 1).

potential map using RHF/6-311G*.

potential map using B3LYP/6-31G*.

Furthermore, to determine the part of the structure of low-rank
coal affected by Na+, the strength of each bond in the
coal structures was determined using Mulliken population analysis.22 Löwdin population analysis was also performed
to support the Mulliken population analysis of symmetric orthogonal
basis functions.23 In this study, the difference
in bond order between the raw coal and ion-exchanged structure was
determined. Although the bond state from the bond order may change,
caution is required because absolute values have little physical significance.
A bond that has a large difference in the Mulliken and Löwdin
bond orders may have either a weak or strong bond. As a precaution,
the bond orders of benzene, (1R)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylic
acid, 4-methylbenzene-1,3-diol, and raw low-rank coal were calculated
using RHF/6-311G* (Figures 7 and 8). The calculations confirmed
that raw low-rank coal had a bond order that was similar to that of
each of the molecules that made up the structure. This suggested that
the raw low-rank coal had a unit structure similar to that of a very
stable single molecule.

Figure 7 Mulliken bond orders using RHF/6-311G*.

Figure 8 Löwdin bond orders using RHF/6-311G*.

The differences between the bond orders of Na+-exchanged
and raw coal are indicated in Figures 9 and 10. The values in red indicate
the bond order of Na+-exchanged coal, which is lower than
that of raw coal by 0.05 or less. The blue characters indicate the
bond order of Na+-exchanged coal, higher by 0.05 or more.
From this point onwards, the red lines indicate weaker bonds. The
blue characters mean that bonds became stronger. In addition, charge
transfer was found to occur between the C=O and C–ONa
bonds in the carboxyl group. However, because the conjugation suggested
charge transfer, only the change in the bond order of the main structure
was considered here. Therefore, the difference in cleaving energy
was estimated using B3LYP/6-31G* when the difference in Mulliken bond
order was 0.06 (Löwdin bond order was 0.05).

bond orders of Na+-exchanged coal by 0.05 or less, relative

orders by 0.05 or more).

increased bond orders of Na+-exchanged coal by 0.05 or

Figure 11 shows
the bond order of the raw low-rank coal. It was calculated to separate
bond A from 1.410 to 5.410 Å in 20 steps with respect to the
most stable structure of raw coal. The relationship between the bond
distance and total energy is also shown in Figure 11. In the raw coal, the energy for the cleaving
bond A was 171.692 kcal/mol. Next, as shown in Figure 12, calculation was performed to cleave bond
A in 20 steps from 1.425 to 5.425 Å in the model (2Na-1). The
energy for cleaving the bond at that time was 122.101 kcal/mol in
the model. Therefore, the cleavage energy of 49.591 kcal/mol was found
to decrease with decreasing Mulliken and Löwdin bond orders
(0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Accordingly, the ease of bond cleavage
was evaluated with a bond order difference of 0.05.

steps).

Next, Figures 13 and 14 show the
Mulliken and Löwdin
bonding orders of the molecular structures (Na-1, 2Na-1, and 3Na)
using RHF/6-311G*. Similar to Figures 9 and 10, red values indicate
that the bond order of the Na+-exchanged coal decreased
by 0.05 or less relative to that of raw coal. Blue values indicate
an increase in the bond order by 0.05 or more. Figures 13 and 14 further show
that the bonds weaken with the increasing number of Na+ ions. Figures 15 and 16 show the results of B3LYP/6-31G* considering
the interaction between electrons with Mulliken and Löwdin
bonding orders. Figures 13–16 show that the bond of the
benzene ring structure tended to weaken with Na+-exchange
in both calculation methods. That is, the electronic state of the
structure appeared to be biased, and the bond was easily broken when
H in the COOH or OH groups of low-rank coal was exchanged with Na
ions. Moreover, decomposition may be promoted by the progress of ion
exchange. In our experiment, although the coal differed, the decomposition
rate was faster for 2.7% LY coal than for 1.6% AD coal.17

orders by 0.05 or more).

In summary, in Na and
C atoms, electrons appear to be attracted
to C atoms even with a simple index such as Pauling’s electronegativity.
According to this study, the substituent in raw coal was located where
it was likely to affect the main structure via ion exchange. According
to the results of this study, the ease of steam gasification with
low-rank coal can conceivably be evaluated using the bond order of
the main structure before and after ion exchange, and, as an evaluation
method, it may be useful to future catalyst research and development.

Conclusions
The experiments in the previous study showed
that the steam gasification
reaction proceeded readily via ion exchange between low-rank coal
molecules and Na.17 The purpose of this
study was to investigate the effect of Na in low-rank coal molecules
on the molecule structure using quantum chemical calculations. As
a result, according to the calculated total energies, structures with
Na+ ions reacting with carboxyl groups were stable. The
structure in which H in a COOH group was ion-exchanged with Na was
found to be the most stable regardless of the number of Na+ ions. Previous research confirmed that Ca2+ ions reacted
with carboxyl groups.20 Therefore, the
calculation results in this study can be considered correct. Moreover,
the Na catalyst affected the electronic state and weak intramolecular
bonding of low-rank coal molecules and caused electron localization.
The quantum chemistry calculations for low-rank coal and Na+ exchange showed that the Na+-exchange model had a weak
bond compared to the bond strength (bond order) of the raw coal model.
Bond strength was found to decrease with increasing number of Na+ ions in Na+-exchanged coal. Although different
types of coal were used in the experiments, gasification of 2.7 mass
% LY coal occurred more readily than that of 1.6 mass % AD coal did.
Consequently, both thermal decomposition and steam gasification reactivity
may be improved. Analysis of the electronic state of the heating process
through quantum chemical calculations will likely be an important
research topic in the future.

Calculation Method
For geometry
optimization and estimation of the electronic states,
Spartan’16 V2.0.7 for Windows (Wavefunction, Inc.) installed
on DELL XPS 8930 (Intel Core i7–8700, system memory 16 GB Double-Data-Rate4
Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory 2666 MHz, and hard disk drive
1 TB, SSD 256 GB) was used for the quantum chemical calculation.21 The conformations of the model structure of
low-rank coal were first analyzed using a molecular dynamics method
(Merck molecular force field).24 Five low-energy
and roughly different structures were selected from the results. These
structures were then calculated using optimized geometry with RHF/3-21G*.25 For Na+-exchanged coal, all possible
combination models exchanged with Na+ in the raw coal were
constructed. These models were also subjected to geometrical optimization.
Finally, the structures calculated with RHF/3-21G* were used as input
data for the calculation using RHF/6-311G*, B3LYP (exchange-correlation
functional), and 6-31G* to obtain accurate results.26,27 B3LYP included all electron interactions other than classical Coulomb
interactions. Therefore, using B3LYP, an accurate solution considering
the relationship between exchange interaction and electron correlation
could be obtained, which is not included in the RHF method.
