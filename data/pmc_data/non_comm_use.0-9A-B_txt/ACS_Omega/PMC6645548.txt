Ferroelectric thin films have been extremely
studied for many applications such as nonvolatile memories, super
capacitors, and solar cells. For these devices, improving the polarization
properties of ferroelectric thin films is of great significance to
their performance. Here, Au–lead zirconate titanate (PZT) nanocomposite
thin films were prepared by a simple one-step chemical solution deposition
(CSD) method on silicon substrates, and the effects of Au concentration
on the ferroelectric properties were investigated. The experimental
results show that the remanent polarization of the Au–PZT films
with 1.2 mol % Au is about 80 μC/cm2, which is 50%
higher than that of the pure PZT thin films. On the basis of the analysis
of chemical valences, the enhanced polarization properties can be
ascribed to the interaction between Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) and
PZT at the Au–PZT interfaces. Our results demonstrate that
the incorporation of an appropriate amount of Au NPs is an effective
way to enhance the polarization properties of ferroelectric films.
The Au–PZT nanocomposite thin films with excellent polarization
properties on silicon substrates are expected to be widely used in
integrated ferroelectric devices.

1 Introduction
Ferroelectric thin films, such as Pb(ZrTi)O3, P(VDF-TrFE), and BiFeO3, have attracted much
attention owing to their applications in nonvolatile memories, super
capacitors, and solar cells.1−3 In general, these functional devices are realized by ferroelectric
polarization-controllable photovoltaic effect,4 resistive switching effect,5 magnetoelectric
coupling effect,6 and other effects.7,8 Therefore, the ferroelectric properties, such as large remnant polarization
value, are crucial to these novel applications. Recently, excellent
polarization properties are mostly achieved in epitaxial high-quality
ferroelectric thin films.9−12 By using suitable single-crystal
substrates and growth parameters, the epitaxial ferroelectric thin
films without defects could be prepared.11 In addition, the remanent polarization could be markedly enhanced
under biaxial compressive imposed by coherent epitaxy in strained
BaTiO3 thin films.12 However,
in these studies, nonsilicon-based single-crystal substrates and complicated
techniques are required, restricting the commercial applications.

On the other hand, to improve the electrical properties of ferroelectric
thin films, noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) owning unique dielectric,
optical, and conductive properties have been composited with ferroelectric
films.13−19 Yang et al. successfully incorporated
Au NPs into BaTiO3 thin films and found that the Au–BaTiO3 nanocomposite films exhibited unique surface plasma resonance
and superfast nonlinear optical response.16 Paik et al. have investigated the effect of Ag NPs on the remanent
polarization of the Ag–P(VDF-TrFE) composite films and found
that the remanent polarization value increased to 10–12 μC/cm2 with respect to P(VDF-TrFE) films (7–8 μC/cm2).17 The Pt–lead zirconate
titanate (PZT) composite powders could be synthesized by the conventional
solid-state reaction and showed an improved dielectric tunability
by 460% and ferroelectric properties by 13%.19 Although the remanent polarization could be increased in metal NPs/ferroelectric
nanocomposite, the values were still too small as compared with ferroelectric
epitaxial thin films. Furthermore, most of the previous studies on
metal NPs/ferroelectric composites have just focused on the composite
powders and dielectric and optical properties,13,16 which
are not very meaningful for the polarization-controllable functional
thin-film devices. In addition, the action mechanism of metal NPs
remains unclear.14,17,20 For
instance, Tsutsumi et al. attributed the enhanced polarization to
the interfacial polarization at the interface of NPs/ferroelectric
films.14 Cheng et al. thought that the
electric field could be locally intensified near the embedded Pt NPs
to promote domain nucleation.20 The enhancement
of effective field and the compensation of local polarization mismatch
have also been reported to explain the increased ferroelectric properties
in metal NPs/ferroelectric composite films.20 Therefore, it is still a key problem to understand the enhancement
mechanism of polarization properties in metal NPs/ferroelectric nanocomposite
films.

In this study, we attempted to use Au NPs to prepare
Au–PZT nanocomposite thin films by a simple one-step chemical
solution deposition (CSD) method on silicon substrates and systematically
study the effect of the amount of Au NPs on ferroelectric properties.
The experimental results show that the remanent polarization of Au–PZT
nanocomposite films can reach 80 μC/cm2, which is
almost the same as that of some high-quality epitaxial PZT thin films.
On the basis of the analysis of chemical valences of elements in the
nanocomposite films, the enhancement in electric properties can be
ascribed to the charge transfer at the PZT–Au interfaces. Our
results not only demonstrate that the ferroelectric films can present
remarkable ferroelectric properties with an appropriate amount of
Au NPs, but also reveal the mechanism of the effect of Au NPs on ferroelectricity.

2 Results and Discussion
In our previous work, we found that the crystallization temperature
of PZT was above 500 °C,21,22 and HAuCl4 decomposed easily to form Au NPs at a heating temperature over 200
°C.23 Accordingly, in the annealing
process, the Au NPs will form before the crystallization of amorphous
PZT matrix for the Au–PZT composite films. Figure 1 shows an ideal schematic of
the Au–PZT nanocomposite film in which the Au NPs are uniformly
distributed in the PZT matrix.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram for
the Au–PZT nanocomposite film and testing electric properties.

To determine the existing form
of Au in the composite films, the chemical valence of Au in the composite
films was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 2 shows the XPS spectra
of Au 4f for the Au–PZT composite films with different Au concentrations.
Compared with the pure PZT film (Figure 2a), Au 4f core-level spectrum can be detected
in the composite films (Figure 2b–d). One peak with a higher binding energy (87.7 eV)
is identified as Au 4f5/2 core-level line, and another
one with a lower binding energy (84.0 eV) is identified as Au 4f7/2 core-level line, which are consistent with the values reported
for pure metal Au.23,24 This result indicates that Au
exists in the composite films as the elementary substance rather than
the compound.

Figure 2 XPS spectra
of Au 4f for the Au–PZT nanocomposite films with (a) 0, (b)
0.6, (c) 1.2, and (d) 12 mol % Au.

Figure 3 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Au–PZT
composite films with different Au concentrations. As shown in Figure 3a, the pure PZT films
are crystallized into the perovskite phase without any secondary phase.
In the Au–PZT composite films with 0.6 mol % Au, in addition
to the diffraction peaks of the perovskite phase of PZT, two relatively
weak diffraction peaks can be observed (Figure 3b), which correspond to the diffraction peaks
of (111) and (200) planes of the face-centered cubic structure of
Au, respectively. The diffraction peaks of Au(111) and Au(200) become
more pronounced with the increasing Au concentration (Figure 3c–f). The results indicate
that there are two phases of the perovskite PZT and the face-centered
cubic structure of Au in the Au–PZT composite films. This is
in full agreement with the XPS results. As mentioned previously, the
XPS results reveal that elementary gold exists in the composite films.
It can also be seen from Figure 3 that compared with the pure PZT film, the location
of the diffraction peaks of the PZT perovskite phase in the composite
films has not changed. The result gives two important pieces of information:
(1) the Au atoms did not dissolve into the PZT perovskite phase, namely,
the addition of Au has no doping effect on the perovskite phase of
PZT and (2) the presence of Au particles did not change the stress
state of the films. Therefore, the effects of stress and doping on
the ferroelectric properties of the composite films can be ruled out
according to the above results.

of the Au–PZT
nanocomposite films with (a) 0, (b) 0.6, (c) 1.2, (d) 2.5, (e) 5,
and (f) 12 mol % Au.

Figure 4 shows the cross-sectional images of the
pure PZT film and the Au–PZT composite films with the Au concentrations
of 1.2 and 12 mol %. The pure PZT film shows a columnar grain structure
(Figure 4a). In the
Au–PZT composite film with 1.2 mol % Au, the columnar grain
structure can also be observed, but in which uniformly dispersed Au
NPs with an average size of about 5 nm appear (Figure 4b). As shown in Figure 4c, when the Au concentration increased to
12 mol %, the columnar grain structure of the perovskite PZT disappeared,
and Au NPs are aggregated into larger Au particles and distributed
unevenly. Namely, the size of Au NPs increases with the increasing
amount of the Au concentration. Even more serious is the emergence
of microcavity in the composite films with higher Au concentrations. Figure 5 shows a high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image for the Au nanoparticle
(Au NPs) in the PZT–Au nanocomposite films with 12 mol % Au.
There is an Au particle with a diameter of about 20 nm, and a microcavity
can be observed near the Au particle. It has been reported that HAuCl4 easily decompose to form Au NPs in composite films when the
heating temperature is above 200 °C.23 Thus, in annealing process, Au NPs were formed before the crystallization
of amorphous PZT matrix and may affect the growth of the perovskite
phase of PZT in the crystallization process. In the Au–PZT
composite film with a higher concentration of Au than 12 mol %, a
large number of relatively large Au particles can hinder the growth
of columnar PZT grains. Accordingly, the columnar grain structure
disappears because of the disordered growth of the PZT grains, even
leading to the formation of microcavities. According to the characteristics
of microstructures, it can be inferred that the electric properties
of the Au–PZT films may become poor with adding a high Au concentration.

films with (a) 0, (a) 1.2, and (c) 12 mol % Au.

Figure 6 shows P–V hysteresis loops of the Au–PZT
nanocomposite films with different Au concentrations measured at 1
kHz and 10 V. All of the films present symmetric P–V hysteresis loops. In addition, the P–V hysteresis loops are saturated
at higher voltages, meaning that there is almost no extrinsic contribution
caused by the leakage current to polarization measurement. The remanent
polarization of the composite films with 1.2 mol % Au concentration
can reach above 80 μC/cm2, which increased by almost
50% with respect to the pure PZT thin films. The enhancement in the
remanent polarization is quite considerable, which can even be compared
with some epitaxial PZT thin films.10,25,26 For comparison, the effects of Au concentration on
the coercive voltage (Vc), remanent polarization
(Pr), and saturation polarization (Ps) are summarized in Figure 7. It can be seen that with the increasing
Au concentration from 0 to 1.2 mol %, Vc drastically decreases, whereas Pr and Ps remarkably increase. However, with further
increase in Au concentration from 1.2 to 12 mol %, Vc slightly decreases, whereas Pr and Ps substantially decrease. Obviously,
the optimal Au concentration in the Au–PZT composite films
is about 1.2 mol % where the best ferroelectric properties are realized.
Also, the outstanding dielectric properties can be also achieved by
adding Au NPs (Figure S1).

Usually,
there are many factors, such as microstructure, stress, and element
doping, that can affect the ferroelectric properties of ferroelectric
films. First of all, the effect of microstructure on the ferroelectric
properties is relatively large. In the Au–PZT composite films,
when the Au concentration reaches 1.2 mol %, the columnar grain structure
of the perovskite PZT begins to disappear and the Au NPs aggregate
into the larger particles (Figure 4c). The density of the films also decreases because
of the emergence of microcavity (Figure 5). Therefore, the ferroelectric properties
in the Au–PZT composite films with the Au concentration of
1.2 mol % become poor. By contrast, the Au–PZT composite films
with the Au concentration of 1.2 mol % are very dense with no defect
owing to the fact that Au NPs uniformly dispersed in the columnar
grains of perovskite PZT (Figure 4b). Besides, the XPS and XRD results (Figures 2 and 3) proved that Au atoms did not enter the PZT lattice, and there was
no change in the stress state of the composite films, thus the stress
and doping effects can be excluded. To explain the increased ferroelectric
properties in metal NPs/ferroelectric composite films, many hypotheses,
such as the compensation of local polarization mismatch and enhancement
of effective field, have been reported.17,20,27 Unfortunately, they are not suitable for Au–PZT
composite films in this study because the content of Au NPs with a
diameter of about 5 nm is relatively small and evenly distributes
in the PZT grains. Hence, we think that the increased ferroelectric
properties in the Au–PZT composite films may be generated by
the interaction between Au NPs and PZT matrix at the Au–PZT
interface.

It has been accepted that the origin of ferroelectricity
can be explained by the delicate balance between long-range Coulomb
interactions favoring the ferroelectric phase and short-range forces
favoring the paraelectric phase. Cohen and Krakauer et al. have demonstrated
that the hybridization among lead 6s (Pb 6s), titanium 3d (Ti 3d),
and oxygen 2p (O 2p) states is essential to weaken the short-range
forces for PZT films by using the first-principles calculations.28,29 Therefore, ferroelectricity is strongly sensitive to Pb 6s, Ti 3d,
and O 2p hybridization, which means the chemical valences of Pb, Ti,
and O could indirectly reflect the ferroelectricity. Recently, the
investigation of chemical valences of elements for ferroelectric perovskite
oxides has been widely studied by XPS.30−32Figure 8 shows the XPS results of O 1s, Ti 2p3/2, Zr 3d5/2, and Pb 4f7/2 for the Au–PZT composite films with
different Au concentrations. The binding energy of O 1s is no significantly
different and Zr 3d5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 only vary
slightly in these Au–PZT films. However, the binding energy
of Ti 2p3/2 first decreases and then increases with the
increase in the Au concentration, and the lowest binding energy appears
at about 1.2 mol % Au. Compared with Figure 7, the variation trend of the polarization
properties and the binding energy of Ti are exactly the same, namely
the lowest binding energy of Ti corresponds to the best ferroelectric
properties at the Au concentration of about 1.2 mol %. In the analysis
of XPS spectra, the binding energy is proportional to the chemical
valences. Therefore, an enhancement in the ferroelectricity of Au–PZT
nanocomposite films could be related to the reduction of Ti valence.
At the PZT–Au interface, the different work functions between
PZT and Au may cause the charge transfer from Au NPs to the PZT matrix.

Figure 8 Changes of
binding energies
of O 1s, Ti 2p, Zr 3d, and Pb 4f for the Au–PZT nanocomposite
films with increase in the concentration of Au.

Figure 9 is a schematic
diagram showing the mechanism for the charge transfer at the PZT–Au
interface and energy band diagram of PZT in the Au–PZT films.
First, the O 2p state makes bonds with Pb 6s state by a σPbO state and the antibonding state of σPbO* state, and then
these σPbO and σPbO* states make bonds with the Ti 3d state
by σPbO–π, σPbO*–π, σPbO*–π*,
and σPbO–π* states. On the basis of
the discussions by Miura and Vanderbilt et al.,33−35 the occupancy of electrons in both π
states and no electrons in π* state make the π bonds between
the O 2p state and Ti 3d state the strongest, which corresponds to
the perfect PZT. If another electron enters the unit cell of PZT or
one electron escapes from the unit cell of PZT, the π bond will
be weakened leading to weakened ferroelectricity. For the actual preparation
of PZT films, the volatilization of lead is unavoidable and a few
holes will appear forming p-type PZT films as the dotted arrow shown
in Figure 9. Therefore,
the ferroelectricity cannot achieve the ideal value. However, the
absent electrons could be supplied by Au NPs in the Au–PZT
films. Considering the addition of Au, the charge transfer is inevitable
because of the different work functions between PZT film and Au NP.
The work functions for typical p-type PZT and metal Au are about 5.8
and 5.1 eV, respectively.31 At PZT–Au
interfaces, owing to the prerequisite of energy continuity, the direction
of charge transfer must be from Au NPs to PZT matrix to unify the
Fermi level.36 For perovskite ATiO3 (A: Pb, Ba, etc.) ferroelectric oxides, the bottom of the
conduction band is composed of Ti 3d orbitals, whereas the top of
the valence band consists of O 2p orbitals. Therefore, the charge
transfer takes place from Au 6s to Ti 3d at the PZT–Au interface,
and some electrons participate in the hybridization by the σPbO*–π
state as shown by the yellow arrow in Figure 9. As a result, the bonding states are full,
and the antibonding states are empty, which is the same as the ideal
unit cell of PZT. Hence, the change of orbital hybridization leads
to the improvement of ferroelectricity. It should be noted that exceeding
electron doping will also deteriorate ferroelectricity owing to the
occupancy of π* state.37,38 Thus, in addition to
the microstructure, this may be another reason for the reduction of
ferroelectric properties in the Au–PZT composite films with
relatively high Au concentrations. In this study, the Au concentration
in the Au–PZT composite films is about 1.2 mol % where the
best ferroelectric properties are realized. There is no doubt that
the ferroelectric properties can be further improved by optimizing
the Au concentration and preparation conditions. On the basis of our
results, it is believed that the Au–PZT nanocomposite thin
films with superior electric properties on silicon substrates will
be widely used in the integrated ferroelectric devices.

3 Conclusions
In this study,
the Au–PZT nanocomposite thin films were prepared by the one-step
CSD method on silicon substrates. In the composite films with the
Au concentration of about 1.2 mol %, the Au NPs are uniformly distributed
in PZT matrix. The composite films show an enhanced remanent polarization
of above 80 μC/cm2, which is 50% higher than that
of pure PZT films. On the basis of the analysis of chemical valences
of elements in the composite films, the enhancements in the electric
properties can be ascribed to the charge transfer at the PZT–Au
interface. The results demonstrate that adding an appropriate amount
of Au NPs is a valid method to improve the polarization properties
of ferroelectric thin films.

4 Experimental Details
Au–Pb(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 (Au–PZT) nanocomposite thin films
with a thickness of 200 nm were grown on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si
substrates by CSD. High-purity lead acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2), zirconium-n-propoxide (Zr(OCH2CH2CH3)4), titanium tetra-isopropoxide
(Ti((CH3)2CHO)4), 2-propanol ((CH3)2CHOH), and gold chloride acid (HAuCl4) were used to prepare the Au–PZT precursor solution. First,
considering the volatility of lead, excess 10% lead was added into
the PZT precursor solution to ensure the ideal atomic ratio of Pb/Zr/Ti
= 1.0:0.4:0.6 as our previous works reported.21,22 Then,
on the basis of the molar ratio of 0.006–0.14:1 (Au vs PZT),
HAuCl4 was dissolved by 2-propanol solution to form HAuCl4 solutions with 0, 0.0024, 0.00, 0.011, 0.021, and 0.055 mol/L.
Finally, the PZT precursor solution and the different HAuCl4 solutions were fully mixed together with a volume ratio of 1:1 to
form Au–PZT precursor solutions. After the above steps, the
Au–PZT precursor solutions were successfully prepared with
the addition of 0, 0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5, and 12 mol % Au, respectively.
After aging for 24 h, the Au–PZT precursor solutions were spin-coated
on the Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates, operated at 3000 rpm for
40 s. The coated films were dried at 120 °C for 10 min and then
pyrolyzed at 350 °C for 10 min. To obtain the PZT thin films
with the designed thickness, the steps mentioned above were repeated
three times before annealing. Finally, the Au–PZT films were
annealed in an electric furnace at 600 °C for 30 min.

The
crystal structure and orientation of the Au–PZT composite films
were analyzed by θ–2θ scan of XRD (Rigaku RINT2000,
Cu Kα radiation). The microstructures of the composite films
were characterized by TEM (Tecnai G2 F20). The TEM specimens were
prepared by the standard procedure of cutting, gluing, slicing, grinding,
and finally ion milling with Ar ions until they were electron transparent
by using a Gatan precision ion-polishing system (PIPS 691; Gatan).
The chemical valence of the ions in the Au–PZT composite films
was determined by XPS (Therma ESCALAB 250; Al Kα source, 1486.60
eV, resolution: 400 meV, energy step: 0.1 eV). As shown in Figure 1, the top electrodes
of Pt with an area of 0.2 mm2 were deposited by sputtering
on the surface of the Au–PZT thin films to form a Pt/Au–PZT/Pt
capacitor structure for testing electric properties. The ferroelectric
properties of the composite films were measured by using a standard
ferroelectric testing system (TF2000E; aixACCT). The dielectric constant
and loss were measured in a frequency range of 102–105 Hz by using an impedance analyzer LCR Hitester (HIOKI 3532-50).
