β-Caryophyllene
(BCP) is a sesquiterpene that shows high potential in pharmacological applications. However, these
have been drastically limited by the respective volatility and poor
water solubility. The present study investigates the formation of
inclusion complexes between BCP and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD)
and shows that these complexes promote a significant improvement of
the anti-inflammatory, gastric protection, and antioxidant activities
relative to neat BCP. It is shown that the solubility of BCP is significantly
increased through complexation in phase solubility studies. Inclusion
complexes with MβCD in solid state were prepared by three different
methods, kneading, rotary
evaporation, and lyophilization, with the latter confirmed by differential
scanning calorimetry, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, scanning
electron microscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and molecular
dynamics studies. This study provides for the first time a full characterization
of inclusion complexes between BCP and MβCD and highlights the
impact of complex formation upon pharmacological activity.

==== Body
Introduction
β-Caryophyllene
(BCP) (Figure 1B) is
one of the main components of the essential oil
obtained from a large number of species of plants and spices used
for medicinal purposes, for example, Korean mint (Agastache
rugosa1), copaiba oil (Copaifera langsdorffii2), and clove (Syzygium aromaticum3). This sesquiterpene was approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (21 CFR 121.1164) as a food additive, and
it was recommended to be used as functional food and dietary supplement
due to its antioxidant properties.4,5

Figure 1 Molecular structures
of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (A) and β-caryophyllene
(B).

Over time, this compound has attracted
considerable attention of
chemists and pharmacologists because of its variety of biological
activities as painkiller,6 anticancer,7 antioxidant, antimicrobial,8 anxiolytic, antidepressive,9 renal protector,10 hepatic protector,1 and neural protector.11 BCP has also been reported to exert strong anti-inflammatory effects
in numerous studies for more than a decade.12−16 It is worth mentioning that BCP promotes this anti-inflammatory
action without causing gastric mucosal injury and that it might be
beneficial to treat gastrointestinal disorders.12,17,18

Despite this recognized pharmacological
potential, the dissolution
of BCP from oral preparations has been shown to be low due to its
poor water solubility and this characteristic is considered a challenge
for the formulation of effective oral dosage forms. Beyond the low
solubility, BCP shows characteristics such as volatility, strong smell,
described as spicy or ligneous, and easy oxidation when exposed to
light and oxygen.19,20 Some strategies have been assessed
to overcome these limitations. Among them, the complexation with cyclodextrins
(CDs) shows a large application in the pharmaceutical industry because
CDs can both improve drug solubility and stability by complexation.21−23 Moreover, they can promote the controlled release of some insoluble
terpenes, such as linalool,24 limonene,25 terpineol,26 and
citronellal.27

The complexation of
BCP with βCD was previously demonstrated
and claimed to be a viable alternative to improve the oral bioavailability
of this compound when administrated in rats.28 Besides, the BCP16 and the essential
oil of Hyptis pectinate,29 which contains 54.07%
of BCP also developed in inclusion complexes (ICs) with βCD,
showed enhanced analgesic pharmacological effects in mice. Nevertheless,
the formation of inclusion complexes of BCP with methyl-β-cyclodextrin
(MβCD) has not been addressed.

In this research, we aim
to investigate the preparation and characterization
of inclusion complex formed by BCP and MβCD. Our main interest
is to explore this inclusion complex as an anti-inflammatory and gastric
protection oral formulation. For this purpose, phase solubility studies
were performed. Subsequently, complexes in solid state were prepared
by kneading (KN), rotary evaporation (ROE), and lyophilization (Lph).
The obtained binary systems were characterized using several techniques,
namely, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transformed
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), rotating-frame
nuclear Overhauser effect (ROESY) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation. In addition, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and
gastric protective studies were conducted in mice to assess the potential
of inclusion complex to improve the activities relative to neat BCP
orally.

Results and Discussion
Phase Solubility Studies
A calibration
curve of BCP
was constructed at 203 nm using a hydroalcoholic solution (1:9, v/v)
as solvent (R2 = 0.997).28,30 Phase solubility studies (Figure 2) showed that BCP solubility increases linearly with
CD concentration and the slope is smaller than unity, over the entire
concentration range studied, indicating an AL-type diagram
with the formation of inclusion complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry for
both cyclodextrins.31

Figure 2 Phase solubility studies
of BCP with MβCD and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
(HPβCD) in aqueous solution at 25 ± 2 °C. The values
are mean ± % standard deviation.

The determination of the stability constant of the inclusion
complexes
is a crucial point for the evaluation of their effectiveness because
the different possible effects related to the complex formation all
rely on the stability of the complexes formed.32,33 Low values of Ks indicate a weak interaction
and a higher amount of free ligand, whereas higher values of Ks indicate that the equilibrium is shifted toward
the formation of the complex. Values within the 100–1000 M–1 range are considered ideal.34−36

Table 1 shows the Ks values calculated for the inclusion complexes
prepared with both cyclodextrins. This value was higher for the complexation
with MβCD (218.76 M–1) compared to HPβCD
(125.00 M–1), indicating a stronger interaction
between BCP and MβCD in aqueous solution. The BCP solubility
increased, approximately, 7- and 10-fold in the presence of the maximum
concentrations of HPβCD and MβCD (40 mM), respectively,
compared to S0. Recently, Rakmai et al.30 have demonstrated Ks values of 104.5 and 132.8 M–1 at 25 and 35 °C,
respectively, for the inclusion complex between BCP and HPβCD,
corroborating with the demonstrated results. However, there are still
no data regarding BCP inclusion complexes with MβCD that in
our study demonstrated to promote a greater solubilization for this
sesquiterpene in the phase solubility study. Considering the results
obtained in aqueous solution, MβCD was selected to prepare and
characterize inclusion complexes with BCP in the solid state.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
1H NMR spectroscopy
analysis was performed to elucidate the structure of BCP/MβCD
inclusion complexes. In the presence of the BCP, notable upfield shifts
for H3 and H5 were observed (see Table 2) in the MβCD spectrum, which demonstrated a
clear involvement of these protons in host–guest interactions.
The order of the upfield shifts was found to be H3 (Δδ
= −0.242 ppm) > H5 (Δδ = −0.116 ppm).
Both
protons are located inside the CD cavity, and H3 protons are near
the wide side of the cyclodextrin. These upfield shifts suggest that
the entrance of the drug in the cavity occurs preferentially by the
wide side. However, pronounced upfield shifts were also observed for
H6 and methyl-6′, which are located near H5 protons, in the
narrow side of the cavity, suggesting that the establishment of drug–cyclodextrin
interactions can also occur by the narrow side.

The δ and corresponding
Δδ values for selected
BCP protons were followed to observe their implication in the establishment
of interactions with MβCD (Table 3). Figure 3 reports expansions of the 1H NMR spectra of those
regions in the absence (A) and presence (B) of MβCD. The observed
upfield shifts indicate that methyl “a” and methyl “b”
are involved in the complexation with the CD, confirming the hypothesis
that this part of the BCP molecule is inside the CD cavity, but the
magnitude of the values is compatible with a weak interaction.

ROESY Spectroscopy
Expansions of the ROESY spectra
of BCP/MβCD inclusion complexes are reported in Figure 3C. These bidimensional experiments
show intermolecular cross-peaks between H6 protons of MβCD and
methyl protons of BCP, namely, methyl a and methyl b. These observations
are consistent with the occurrence of interactions between BCP methyl
groups (a and b) and H6 protons of the CD, confirming the partial
inclusion of the drug in cyclodextrin cavity by the narrow side or
complete inclusion by the wide side. The computer simulation indicates
the possibility of this last hypothesis (see Figure 4B, panel b), showing an almost complete inclusion
of the molecule by the wide side as demonstrated when inspected the
orientation of the BCP in the complex by the part of the molecule
that contain the carbon 10, which is close to the methyl groups a
and b.

portal with the OH substituents and p2 for the CH2OCH3-substituted portal); (b) distance from the center of mass
(CM) and from p1 and p2 to the CM of the BCP; (c) distribution of
distances between CM, p1 and p2 of MβCD, and the C5 atom of
the BCP; (d) distances from CM, p1 and p2 of MβCD to C10 atom
of the BCP molecule. (B) Snapshots extracted from the 60 ns of the
production run at 298 K representing some characteristic configurations
found for the system BCP/MβCD.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To obtain further molecular
detail on the complexation between MβCD and BCP in solution,
the distance between selected points in the MβCD and the drug
molecule was monitored. The results depicted in Figure 4A show the inclusion of the drug molecule
in the CD ring and its relative position inside the MβCD cavity.
Panel (a) represents the distance between the center of mass of the
two molecules and the distance between each portal of the MβCD
and the center of mass of the drug. The curves show that the inclusion
of the drug occurs and that it is preferentially located near to portal
1, which is the wide side. This is in fact in accordance with the
snapshots presented in Figure 4B. This hypothesis has been demonstrated in 1H
NMR when upfield shifts for H3 and H5 of MβCD were observed.

Additionally, to inspect the orientation of the BCP molecule in
the complex, the distance between two opposite points in the drug
and the center of mass of MβCD and each of its portals was also
inspected. The curves presented in panels (b) and (c) of Figure 4A show that inclusion
occurs preferentially by the C5 region of BCP (see Figure 4B, panel a), although the inclusion
can also occur by the C10 part of the molecule (Figure 4B, panel b). The results also show an almost
complete inclusion of the molecule. Thus, molecular dynamics suggest
the possibility of existence of a new conformation (panel a) for the
complex, in addition to that evidenced by NMR studies (panel b).

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
FTIR spectra of MβCD, BCP, physical mixture (PM), and binary
systems are represented in Figure 5. The infrared spectrum of BCP (Figure 5A) showed absorption bands of stretching
vibrations at 3069 and 1447 cm–1 of =CH.
At 1635 cm–1 appears a stretching vibration related
to C=C bond. The double band at 1381 and 1368 cm–1 of symmetrical deformation of −CH3 can be ascribed
to two methyl groups connected to the same carbon atom. Methylenic
hydrogens originate two CH stretching bands observed at 2925 cm–1 (asymmetric stretching) and 2857 cm–1 (symmetric stretching) that are characteristic of CH2 groups. The most intense band for BCP was observed at 886 cm–1 assigned to out-of-plane deformation vibration of
=CH characterizing the molecule.8,16,28,37

Figure 5 (A) FTIR spectrum of
BCP. (B) FTIR spectra of MβCD, BCP,
physical mixture (PM), and inclusion complexes obtained by KN, ROE,
and LPh methods.

The FTIR spectrum of
MβCD (Figure 5B) shows a large band at 3385 cm–1 (O–H
stretching), 2928 cm–1 (stretching
C–H), and 1193, 1082, and 1022 cm–1 (C–O–
stretching compatible to the bonds on ether and hydroxyl groups).
The spectrum of the PM presents the characteristic absorption band
of BCP at 886 cm–1 (as emphasized in Figure 5B) although its intensity is
weaker. However, this band is not observed when the spectra of the
complexes were analyzed, probably due to a restriction of the vibration
related to the complexation process. This corroborates the results
already obtained for the complexes obtained between BCP and βCD.28 In the spectrum of the inclusion complexes,
few features were observed to be identical to BCP. Those changes can
be ascribed to the formation of the inclusion complex related to the
intermolecular bonds between BCP and MβCD.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The DSC technique
proved to be a very powerful analytic tool to characterize the interactions
among drugs and CDs in the solid state. When guest molecules are stabilized
in CD cavities, their melting, boiling, or sublimation peaks are generally
shifted to a different temperature or disappear.38−40 The thermal
behaviors of the pure components and binary systems are represented
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 DSC thermograms
of BCP, MβCD physical mixture (PM), and the
inclusion complexes obtained by ROE, LPh, and KN.

The thermogram of MβCD reveals an endothermic event
between
43 and 120 °C, which corresponds to the loss of water molecules.41 BCP revealed one endothermic event between 45
and 127 °C (Tpeak 116 °C) assigned
to its volatilization.16 On the thermogram
of the PM, the endothermic MβCD loss of water event remained
unchanged and an additional endothermic event between 160 and 200
°C (Tpeak = 190 °C) was observed,
which can be ascribed to the presence of BCP. The residual presence
of the volatilization peak of the BCP in physical mixtures, although
displaced, is indicative of the existence of free BCP molecules.22,29,42

Concerning the thermal
curves of the binary systems (ROE, LPh,
and KN), the dehydration signals of MβCD were observed to be
smaller and displaced, indicating a possible change of the activation
energy necessary to the dehydration of MβCD due the establishment
of interactions in solid state with BCP.42,43

In the system obtained by the KN, the endothermic peak characteristic
of the drug is displaced to a higher temperature (200 °C), suggesting
a partial complexation between BCP and MβCD. However, in the
thermograms of the complexes prepared by ROE and LPh methods, the
BCP volatilization peak was not observed. The absence of this peak
indicates the formation of inclusion complexes in solid state and
a more stable interaction between the drug and the MβCD in these
systems.44−46

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) is a qualitative method that allows the study of
the structural aspect of the raw material and the products obtained
by complexation with cyclodextrins. Figure 7 shows the microphotographs of MβCD
(A) constituted by spherical particles, which can be also observed
in the PM (B). However, in the microphotographs of the complexes obtained
by the KN (C), ROE (D), and LPh (E) methods, it is possible to observe
the presence of irregular amorphous particles, in which the original
morphology of MβCD disappeared. Those changes on the surface
structure of the isolated compounds indicate the establishment of
interactions with a new phase formation.29,41,47,48

Figure 7 Scanning electron
microphotographs of MβCD (A), PM (B), and
the complexes prepared by KN (C), ROE (D), and LPh (E) methods at
a magnification factor of 1000×.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that drastic changes
in the
particles’ form and aspect were introduced, corroborating the
other results. Studies have demonstrated that the LPh technique substantially
improves the dissolution characteristics of hydrophobic drugs due
to high complexing efficiency resulting in an excellent pharmacological
effect of the inclusion complexes obtained. In addition, the product
obtained has amorphous characteristics as observed in Figure 7. This method can produce a
good yield of inclusion complex and it is possible to scale up. Additionally,
it has been widely used for thermolabile compounds, such as terpenes.49−52 The yield observed for this complex was 66.22%, lower than that
obtained by KN, which obtained the highest yield (86.85%).

Due
to the simplicity and high yield, the KN technique has been
widely used. However, its efficiency of complexation may be inferior
to that achieved with other techniques.53 Menezes et al.,48 for example, demonstrated
a partial complexation of the monoterpene linalool by the KN method. In the DSC studies, this system demonstrated a thermal profile similar
to PM and thus the possibility of a less complexation for this system
was emphasized.

The complex obtained by ROE in the DSC curve
presented a possibility of greater complexion in relation to KN. However,
it presented a lower yield (63.98%) besides the need for strict temperature
control to avoid the possibility of volatilization of this terpene
during drying. Due to these reasons and other characterization studies,
such as H NMR spectroscopy, the LPh system was chosen as the most
promising system for future use in solid dosage forms. However, new
studies may in the future still explore the system obtained by ROE
because it presented similar results to LPh in the characterization
studies by FTIR and DSC.

In Vivo Pharmacological Studies
Several studies have
demonstrated the pharmaceutical or pharmacological benefits of a CD
inclusion complex with natural products, and the complexation BCP/βCD
previously showed to improve the oral bioavailability and the pharmacokinetics
of free BCP after a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg on rats.28 Thus, we assessed the pharmacological activity
of BCP/MβCD orally (50 mg/kg, using a solution obtained with
the Lph system) in classic animal models.

Effect of BCP and BCP/MβCD
on Carrageenan-Induced Paw
Edema in Mice
The anti-inflammatory potential of the inclusion
complex was evaluated using a classic pharmacological model of carrageenan-induced
paw edema in mice (Figure 8A). This model shows a progression of a biphasic inflammation.
The first one is characterized by cellular infiltrate with predominance
of polymorphonuclear (PMN) neutrophils. These cells amplify the inflammatory
response via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and via inflammatory
mediators. The second phase (24 h after induction of edema) is characterized
by the intense accumulation of cells such as macrophages, eosinophils,
and lymphocytes.54,55

Figure 8 (A) Effects of BCP and BCP/MβCD
on edema paw inflammation
induced by carrageenan. Animals were pretreated with BCP, BCP/MβCD
50 mg/kg orally, or indomethacin (INDO,10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally
(ip)) #p < 0.05 compared to Sal*; *p < 0.05 compared to BCP/MβCD. (B) Histological
examination of paw tissue sections 3 h after carrageenan injection:
(a) vehicle control (Sal), (b) carrageenan control (Sal*), (c) treated
with BCP, (d) treated with BCP/MβCD, and (e) treated with standard
drug indomethacin.

The present experiments
confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect
of BCP 50 mg/kg in the first phase of carrageenan-induced paw edema. Also, BCP was able to reduce the edema by 55.8% during its peak (third
hour), which is in agreement with the results previously obtained
in rats by Fernandes et al.;13 this inhibition
is similar to the positive control (indomethacin reduction −61.04%).
In turn, the inclusion complex further reduced the edema by 84%, demonstrating
that the inclusion complex clearly improves the anti-inflammatory
activity (Figure 8A).

Histological sections of tissue from the paw edema were observed
for inflammatory markers. High infiltration damage due to accumulation
of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells and collection of fluid was seen
in the carrageenan control (Figure 8B panel b, infiltrate of inflammatory cells indicated
by arrowhead and edema indicated by pentagon). Biopsies of paw of
animals treated with BCP (panel c) and BCP/MβCD (panel d) (50
mg/kg) indicated a reduction in carrageenan-induced inflammatory response
similar to the indomethacin group (panel e), confirming its anti-inflammatory
activity.

The neutrophil-specific enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO),
which is
an indicator of neutrophil migration into the inflammatory site and
has been found in neutrophil azurophilic granules, was investigated
in tissue homogenates of the paws submitted to edema, as shown in Figure 9a. This enzyme activity
was increased by carrageenan (Figure 9a; 12.9 ± 1 UMPO/mg of tissue), whereas the groups
treated with BCP and BCP/MβCD showed a considerable inhibition
of MPO activity (2.6 ± 0.9 and 5.1 ± 1.3 UMPO/mg of tissue,
respectively), which was similar to the reduction in the action of
this tissue enzyme by indomethacin (3.9 ± 0.6). Because MPO activity
levels in BCP- and BCP/MβCD-treated animals were lower than
those of Sal* animals, it is possible to note that their anti-inflammatory
activity involves the inhibition of neutrophil migration to the site
of the inflammation.

test.

Anti-Inflammatory Effects
of BCP and BCP/MβCD on Carrageenan-Induced
Peritonitis in Mice
To further investigate the anti-inflammatory
activity previously demonstrated, carrageenan peritonitis was induced
in mice to evaluate its modulatory action under the infiltrate of
defense cells and antioxidant action (Figure 9). Carrageenan administration into the peritoneal
cavity promoted an increase in the counts of leukocytes ((36
± 1.9) × 106 cells/mL) and neutrophils ((15.3
± 0.5) × 106 cells/mL) (p <
0.05) (Figure 9b,c)
in the peritoneal fluid. However, pretreatment with BCP and BCP/MβCD
revealed significantly reduced leukocyte migration into the peritoneal
cavity ((15.8 ± 2.8) × 106; (16 × ±
3) × 106 cells/mL), and the same dose also considerably
decreased the neutrophil count ((11 ± 1.2) × 106; (10.3 ± 0.4) × 106 cells/mL, p < 0.05). We note that the oral treatment with natural products
with high content of BCP, such as copaiba oil, also inhibited total
leukocyte and neutrophil accumulation.2

Antioxidant Effect of BCP and BCP/MβCD on Carrageenan-Induced
Peritonitis in Mice
Reactive oxygen species have been proposed to play an
important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and to highlight
the antioxidant properties of the obtained complex evaluated by the
levels of malonyldehyde, nitrite, and reduced glutathione. Figure 9a′ indicates
that the injection of carrageenan into the peritoneal cavity significantly
increased MDA levels (8.7 ± 0.6 nmol/mL) compared to the saline-treated
group (3.8 ± 0.6 nmol/mL). On the other hand, the groups pretreated
with BCP and BCP/MβCD presented significantly reduced MDA levels
(1.2 ± 0.1 and 1.5 ± 0.5 nmol/g tissue, respectively, p < 0.05) compared to the carrageenan and saline-treated
groups, evidencing the good antioxidant activity of BCP and BCP inclusion
complex.

The injection of carrageenan into the peritoneal cavity
also showed significantly increased Nox levels (0.83 ± 0.02 nmol/mL)
(Figure 9b′)
relative to the saline-treated group (0.30 ± 0.06 nmol/mL). The
group pretreated with BCP and BCP/MβCD displayed significantly
reduced Nox levels (0.19 ± 0.006 and 0.23 ± 0.06 nmol/g
tissue, respectively) compared to the carrageenan group (Sal*) and
the saline-treated group, again evidencing the good antioxidant action
of BCP and BCP/MβCD. This action is comparable to that obtained
in the indomethacin group (0.13 ± 0.007; p <
0.05, Figure 9). Furthermore,
treatment with carrageenan (34 ± 8.5 mg/g tissue) produces a
lower content of glutathione than the saline group (98.3 ± 16.4
mg/g tissue; see Figure 9c′). Pretreatment with complexed BCP (BCP/MβCD) significantly
increased (94.4 ± 7.6 mg/g tissue) glutathione levels to values
similar to the group that did not receive carrageenan. Because treatment
with free BCP in solution could not restore GSH levels, this sesquiterpene
clearly presented better results in the complexed form.

These
results confirm the previous findings on BCP, reporting chain-breaking
antioxidant activity and ability to scavenge ROS in different tissues.4,56,57 The present study demonstrated
that the inclusion complex could be a way to orally deliver the insoluble
sesquiterpene BCP and at the same time to improve the respective properties.

Prevention of Ethanol-Induced Gastric Damage by BCP and BCP/MβCD
Among the interesting properties related to BCP, its anti-inflammatory
action was shown to be devoid of associated gastric damage, demonstrating,
on the other hand, to exert gastric and cytoprotective anti-inflammatory
effects on the gastrointestinal tract.12,17 In this regard,
the gastric protective effects of the inclusion complex obtained (Figure 10) were evaluated.

analysis of the gastric lesions induced by ethanol pretreated with
BCP and BCP/MβCD. (A) Effects of BCP and BCP/MβCD (50

(50 mg/kg) on MDA concentrations in gastric damage. Data are presented
as mean ± SEM of five mice per group. Results were analyzed by
analysis of variance, followed by Newman–Keuls post hoc test.

Our results showed that treatment
of mice with ethanol led to severe
macroscopic gastric damage characterized by intense hemorrhage (19.0
± 2.4 mm2), in agreement with the already described
findings.58−61 Interestingly, pretreatment with BCP and BCP/MβCD in aqueous
solution prevented ethanol-induced macroscopic damage, to an extent
similar to that found in the omeprazol (OMP)-treated group (Figure 10A′, 2.6
± 1 and 2.0 ± 0.8 mm2, respectively, p < 0.005). The pathogenesis of gastric mucosal damage
induced by ethanol is a multifactorial process involving an increase
in aggressive factors, such as ROS generation and a decrease in endogenous
defense mechanisms.61

Antioxidant
Effect of BCP and BCP/MβCD on Ethanol-Induced
Gastric Damage
It has been suggested that oxygen-derived
free radicals (ROS) is the main factor that contributes to ethanol-induced
gastric mucosal lesions.62,63 This effect in gastric
mucosa by ROS is mediated by lipid peroxidation. It was also demonstrated
that ethanol reduces GSH and glutathione peroxidase activity.59,64

Treatment with 50% of ethanol significantly decreased GSH
concentrations (112.4 ± 15.1 mg/g tissue) and increased MDA levels
(205.2 ± 21.5 nmol/g tissue) compared to the control group (p < 0.05; Figure 10). Pretreatment with BCP (50 mg/kg) and BCP/MβCD
(50 mg/kg) in aqueous solution increased the levels of the endogenous
antioxidant GSH (166.3 ± 17.6 and 231.1 ± 16.3 mg/g tissue,
respectively), restoring the damage caused by ethanol (Figure 10A), and BCP/MβCD exhibited
a significantly better (p < 0.05) effect than
BCP. The administration of BCP (50 mg/kg) and BCP/MβCD (50 mg/kg)
(96.4 ± 8 and 77.2 ± 11.78 nmol/g tissue, respectively)
also significantly reduced the concentration of gastric mucosal MDA
induced by ethanol (Figure 10B).

In a previous study, BCP is demonstrated to exert
protective effects
on the gastric mucosa with suppression of ulcerogenesis in doses from
25 mg/kg orally, without affecting gastric acid secretion. Its action
is suggested potentiating defensive mucosal factors.12 This study shows based on GSH and MDA levels that BCP/MβCD
also has protective effects on gastric mucosa and that this effect
seems to involve the reduction of lipid peroxidation induced by ethanol
instillation.

Several studies have shown that complexation of
standard drugs
or active natural products in cyclodextrins can improve their biological
effects.65,66 Here, we demonstrated that the BCP/MβCD
inclusion complex can be a useful drug-delivery system to improve
the pharmacological activity of BCP and could be a strategy to circumvent
the technical features that have limited its therapeutic use.

Conclusions
We have formulated a novel inclusion complex with BCP in MβCD
that can lead to important modifications on the solubility of the
guest. Information obtained from DSC, SEM, and 1H NMR studies
show that stable solid BCP/MβCD inclusion complexes can be prepared
at a 1:1 molar ratio by KN, ROE, and LPh methods. The LPh system has
been shown to be more promising for future use in solid dosage forms.
Data from 1H NMR and ROESY spectra demonstrate that complexation
occurs preferentially by the doubly methylated part of BCP, and molecular
dynamics simulation studies showed the possibility of two kinds of
inclusion of the BCP. In both cases, the drug molecule stays preferentially
closer to the wider portal of the CD cavity. Moreover, this inclusion
complex promotes an improvement of the anti-inflammatory, gastric
protection and antioxidant activities relative to neat BCP. Therefore,
BCP/MβCD can be a useful new drug-delivery system to BCP molecule
and could be one solution to technical features that have limited
the therapeutic use of this active natural product.

Experimental
Section
Phase Solubility Studies
Phase solubility studies were
performed using MβCD and HPβCD following the method described
by Higuchi and Connors.31 For this purpose,
an excess of BCP was added to the flask containing increased concentrations
(0–40 mM) of MβCD or HPβCD in aqueous solution.
The samples were kept under agitation for 72 h until equilibrium.
After that, aliquots were taken, filtered with membrane filters (0.45
μm), diluted in a solution of ethanol/water (1:9, v/v), centrifuged
for 10 min, and analyzed spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu UV 1800) at 203 nm.28,67 The experiments were conducted in triplicate. The apparent stability
constants (Ks) were calculated with the
data obtained from the following equation  where S0 represents
the intrinsic solubility of the β-caryophyllene.

Preparation
of the Inclusion Complexes in the Solid State
According to
the phase solubility results, solid systems were prepared
in an equimolar ratio between BCP and MβCD. Three distinct methods
were used: KN, ROE, and LPh. The physical mixture (PM) between BCP
and MβCD was also prepared and used as reference. PM was prepared
by simply blending BCP and MβCD with 1:1 molar ratio uniformly
in a mortar. The KN, ROE, and LPh were prepared according to the methodology
already described by de Freitas et al.23 and Santos et al.68 with some modifications.
CD was previously sieved (180 μm sieve granulometric fraction).
The final products were hermetically stored in a closed amber glass.

Characterization of the Prepared Inclusion Complexes
Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR
analyses were performed in a JASCO FT/IR-420 spectrometer associated
with horizontal reflection attenuated total reflection (MIRacle, PIKE
Technologies). The spectra were obtained in the region of the IR (4000–400
cm–1) with the application of 16 scans at a resolution
of 4 cm–1.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC)
Thermal analyses
of raw materials and prepared systems were carried out using a differential
scanning calorimeter (Shimadzu 60 series) associated to a thermic analyzer
linked to the software Shimadzu TA-60WS/PC. The analyses were made
in an atmosphere of nitrogen with a flux of 20 cm3/min
under a heat ratio of 10 °C/min from 25 to 250 °C. For this
purpose, sealed aluminum pans were used. An empty pan was used as
reference. Indio (99.98%, 156.65 °C, Aldrich, Milwaukee) was
used as standard for the calibration of the temperature.

Scanning
Electronic Microscopy (SEM)
The surface morphology
of MβCD and binary systems was examined and photographed using
a scanning electron microscope (JSM 6010-LC, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
The samples were fixed in surfaces of double-sided tape, and further,
a coating with a thin layer of gold was made due to the nonconductivity
of samples. Photographs were taken at an excitation voltage of 10
kV and a magnification factor of 1000×.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
1H NMR spectra
of BCP, MβCD, and the LPh binary system were acquired on a Varian
600 MHz spectrometer using a 3 mm indirect detection NMR probe and
deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 as solvent. Acquisition parameters consisted of 43k points covering
a sweep width of 7.2 kHz, a pulse width of 2.4 μs, equivalent
to a 45° pulse angle, and a total repetition time of 10 s. 1H NMR chemical shift variations (Δδ) were calculated
according to the formula  

ROESY Spectroscopy
The extent and the direction of
the inclusion in the CD cavity were determined by two-dimensional
phase-sensitive nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy by the
detection of intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) between
BCP and MβCD. ROESY spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive
mode using the same spectrometer and probe. Acquisition parameters
included 1.7k and 0.9k in F2 and F1 dimensions, respectively, defining
a spectral width of 5 kHz. Before Fourier transform, the FID was zero-filled and multiplied by a Gaussian apodization function in
both dimensions. The magnetization mixing period chosen was 150 ms,
after calibration.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
MD
simulations were carried
out using the Gromacs package, version 4.5.5,69 and the GROMOS 53a6 force field was applied.70 The structure of MβCD was constructed from βCD
(obtained from the HIC-Up online database), in which the methyl groups
were introduced to achieve the appropriate substitution degree of
the CD used experimentally.71−73 The topologies for MβCD
and BCP molecule structure were obtained by the ATB server.74

The two molecules were immersed in cubic
boxes filled with necessary water molecules. The SPC216 water model
was used for the solvent molecules. MD simulations were carried out
in the NpT ensemble and under periodic boundary conditions, at a constant
pressure (1 bar) and constant temperature (298 K) coupled, respectively,
to v-rescale and Berendsen external baths. A standard time step of
2 fs was used for both equilibration and production runs. Nonbonded
interactions were computed on the basis of a neighbor list, updated
every 10 steps.

The long-range electrostatic interactions were
treated based on
the particle mesh Ewald method.75 A cutoff
of 1.2 nm was applied for the Lennard-Jones energies. Initial energy
minimization was performed for the system and then a production run
of 100 ns using the LINCS algorithm.76,77 The last 60 ns were subjected to the
standard analysis. The formation of the inclusion complex was a result
of an equilibration process in vacuum, which was only considered to
be completed when inclusion was visualized. The trajectories of the
host–guest molecules interactions were saved and analyzed.
The configuration images were produced using the software VMD 1.9.

Animals
Mice (Swiss, 25–30 g) of both sexes were used. They were maintained in a room with controlled
temperature (22 ± 1 °C) under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle
for at least a week before being used (five to six animals per group).
The animals had water ad libitum and a standard pellet diet. The care
of laboratory animals was performed in accordance with the Guide for
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health)
and was approved by the local ethics committee (Protocol No. 0002/15).

Drug Administration
Equivalent volumes of test drugs or vehicle
were administered in separate groups (n = 5) of mice
prior to inducing them to the pharmacological models. In separate
experiments, were injected intraperitoneally (ip) saline solution
0.9% as untreated control (Sal*), indomethacin (INDO) as standard
anti-inflammatory drug 10 mg/kg, and omeprazol (OMP) as standard gastric
protect drug 10 mg/kg given in saline. The BCP was dissolved in water
to obtain a solution of the same content of BCP in a solution obtained
by dissolving the solid inclusion complex obtained by the LPh system.
These solutions were administrated orally in separated groups described
by BCP 50 mg/kg (BCP) or BCP/MβCD 50 mg/kg (BCP/MβCD).
The negative group received an injection of 0.9% sterile saline (Sal).

Carrageenan-Induced Paw Edema Test
Carrageenan-induced
paw edema test was carried out as previously described.54 After 1 h treatments of tested drugs (Sal*,
INDO, BCP, and BCP/MβCD) edema was induced by intraplantar injection
of 50 μL of a carrageenan suspension (500 μg/paw) in 0.9%
sterile saline. The negative (Sal) group received an injection of
50 μL of 0.9% sterile saline only. Paw volume was measured immediately
after the induction (Vo) and 1, 2, 3,
and 4 h after carrageenan treatment (Vt) using a plethysmometer (LE 7500, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). The
effect of pretreatment was calculated as percent inhibition of edema
relative to the paw volume of the untreated control using the following
formula  

Histological Analysis
To evaluate the degree of inflammation,
all groups submitted to carrageenan-induced paw edema tests underwent
histopathological analysis. Paw biopsies were taken 4 h after carrageenan
administration. Tissue slices were fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde
for 24 h, dehydrated in ethanol 70%, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned
(5 μm). The sections were stained with hematoxylin–eosin
and examined under a light microscope analysis.

Assessment
of Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Activity
MPO activity
in paw tissues was measured by the method described by Bradley et al.78 Paw tissues (50 mg)
were crushed in hexadecyltrimethylammonium buffer (pH 6) using a tissue
homogenizer and centrifuged at 4500 rpm (12 min at 4 °C). The
supernatant was collected to react with a solution of 1% hydrogen
peroxide. The optical density change of the samples following the
addition of o-dianisidine was measured by a spectrophotometer
(450 nm) as a function of reaction time. MPO activity was defined
as the quantity of enzyme degrading 1 μmol of hydrogen peroxide
per minute at 22 °C and was expressed in units of MPO (UMPO)/mg
tissue.78

Carrageenan-Induced Peritonitis
Test
Carrageenan-induced
peritonitis test was carried out as previously described by administrating
250 μL of a carrageenan suspension (500 μg/cavity, ip)
1 h after the pretreatment with Sal*, INDO, BCP, or BCP/MβCD.
After 4 h, the animals were euthanized and the peritoneal cavity was
washed with 1.5 mL of heparinized phosphate-buffered saline, to obtain
peritoneal cells. Total cell count was determined using a Neubauer
chamber. The differential 100 cell count was performed in slides prepared
using a cytocentrifuge, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined
with an optical microscope for neutrophil migration. Aliquots of the
peritoneal exudates were stored at −70 °C for later analysis.
The reduced glutathione (GSH) content in the exudate was estimated
according to the method described by Sedlak and Lindsay,79 the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured
by the method of Mihara and Uchiyama,80 and nitrite content was determined as previously described by Prado
et al.81

Effects of BCP and BCP/MβCD
on Ethanol-Induced Gastric
Damage
The animals were deprived of food for 18–24
h before the experiments, but had free access to water and were initially
pretreated with Sal*, BCP, BCP/MβCD, or OMP. After 1 h, ethanol
50% (0.5 mL/25 g) was administered by gavage. One hour after ethanol
ingestion, the mice were euthanized and stomach samples were collected
for biochemical analysis and macroscopic evaluations of gastric mucosa.
Gastric damage was measured using a computer planimetry program (ImageJ
software; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).58 Reduced GSH content in stomach samples as nonprotein
sulfhydryls was estimated according to the method described by Sedlak
and Lindsay,79 and malondialdehyde (MDA)
assay was measured using the method of Mihara and Uchiyama.80
