Synthesis of ε-caprolactam
in a twin screw extruder by anionic
ring-opening polymerization was successfully carried out to prepare
a novel nylon 6 (polyamide 6 (PA6)) containing a small amount of diamine
moiety. The produced PA6 shows a remarkable improvement of the physical
properties (mechanical properties as well as rheological properties).
Added diamine molecules led to some structural changes in the synthesized
PA6. The molar ratio of the additive (diamine) to the initiator appeared
to be optimum at ca. 0.1. Although the molar mass of the PA6 has not
changed significantly, less than twice the PA6 molar mass, the physical
properties of the polymers produced have been markedly improved. The
zero shear rate viscosity of the PA6 at the optimum diamine concentration
appeared to be increased by almost 30 times that of the pure PA6.
We have attributed this remarkable increase in viscosity to structural
changes (branching formation during synthesis) and increased molar
mass. The storage modulus at a low shear rate increased more than
100 times that of the pure PA6, but the loss modulus increased only
10-fold. This indicates that the elastic properties dominated due
to the enhanced chain entanglements. In addition, the mechanical properties
were significantly improved at the optimal amount of diamine reagent
concentration. The elongation at break for the sample with optimum
diamine addition was increased to twice that of neat PA6, whereby
the tensile toughness was also doubled. Produced PA6 has a merit of
processibility in the extrusion process such as a blow molding process
in which stability against sagging under gravity is required and other
processes in which elongational properties dominate.

Introduction
Nylon 6 (polyamide 6 (PA6)) is widely
used in the film and packaging
industry, the fiber industry, and the textile industry because of
its outstanding physical properties such as toughness, ductility,
durability, and price.1−3 A variety of activators can polymerize an ε-caprolactam
monomer within a few minutes through the anionic ring-opening polymerization
(AROP) process to form PA6. They enable the in situ production of
PA6 in processing operations such as reactive extrusion (REX) and
reactive injection molding (RIM).4−10 The direct ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactam in
an extruder (a reactive extrusion process) has many obvious advantages
in addition to the short reaction time so that the molecular weight
of the products can be several times greater than that synthesized
by conventional condensation polymerization and no by-products are
formed during the synthesis.5,7−10 On the other hand, polymers synthesized by the condensation polymerization
such as PA6 or polyesters are known to have low molecular weights,
which induce quite distinctive rheological properties compared to
other polymers synthesized by the free radical polymerization. They
have not only a broad Newtonian viscosity plateau over a wide range
of shear rates but also quite low melt viscosity.11−14 Therefore, it has a problem to
be applied in the extrusion process in which stability against sagging
under gravity is required such as a blow molding process and other
processes where elongational properties dominate.14

However, PA6 has another useful feature: its excellent
reactivity
due to the reactive functional end groups. Molecules of the PA6 chain
have active amine and carboxylic acid groups at the chain end that
can react with other functional groups of organic/inorganic materials.7,8 Especially, an anhydride or epoxide group can react actively with
amine end groups of PA6 chains.13,15 Thus, a bifunctional
molecule capable of reacting with two PA6 molecules can extend the
molar mass of PA6.13 Some years ago, White
and co-workers have extensively investigated the use of the reactive
extrusion process for the synthesis of polyamides and block copolymers
of poly(lactam-co-lactone).16−18 In our previous
study, we attempted to solve the rheological problems of polymers
synthesized by the condensation polymerization process such as PA6
with a simple procedure, increasing the molar mass by adding a bifunctional
linking agent. The linking agent can couple two chains to double its
molar mass, and its viscosity can be enhanced 10 times because the
shear viscosity of entangled linear polymer melts enhances with the
molecular weight as M3.4.13 A diepoxy (4,4′-di(2,3-epoxypropyloxy)phenyl benzoate)
was synthesized and mixed with a commercial PA6. The results demonstrated
that the diepoxy-added nylon 6 revealed an unusual behavior as the
linking agent was added.13 The chain relaxation
dynamics were varied by several orders of magnitude by controlling
the linking agent concentration. It depends on the amount of diepoxy
to react with the end group of PA6 (amine group). The absolute value
of the melt viscosity, η, at low frequencies increases significantly,
while the shear thinning range extends over the entire shear rate.
When the specimen included more molar amounts of the epoxy group than
the amine group of nylon 6 (over 1:1 ratio), the melt viscosity at
the peak was enhanced more than 200 times higher than that of the
pure nylon 6 melt, which was attributed to the occurrence of long-chain
branching without formation of a network structure (or a gel) in the
melt.13,15

In this study, we performed the synthesis
of the ε-caprolactam
in situ by a reactive extrusion process.19−28 ε-Caprolactam powder was premixed with a very small amount
of diamine before the feeding process. The added diamine can participate
in the PA6 synthesis reaction in the extruder since the anion can
attack the amine group in the chain growth reaction or can only be
quenched by the amine to stop the polymerization at a low conversion
state or partially react with the anions to form various structures.1−3 Other researchers considered the cross-linking reaction occurrence
between diepoxides and polylactams and found that the diepoxide can
form block copolymers or cross-link the matrix polymers, depending
on the amount of diepoxide added.19−21 In addition to the cross-linking
reaction, other reactions may occur if the amount of the diepoxide
is small compared to ε-caprolactam. To preclude the occurrence
of the cross-linking reaction, the amount of diamine was limited to
a very low level compared to the initiator (less than 0.4 mol % of
the total reactants), and the appearance of a different structure
than the cross-linking reaction was expected to occur. By comparing
the physical properties of PA6 synthesized by AROP with and without
the diamine, a clue for the puzzle of drastic change in the physical
properties reported in our previous study can be found.13 The newly synthesized PA6 can be used in the
extrusion process such as the blow molding process, which requires
stability against sagging under gravity, and other processes in which
elongational properties dominate.

Results and Discussion
The mechanisms of ε-caprolactam polymerization by AROP with
a terephthaloyl biscaprolactam (TBC) activator are shown in Scheme 1. TBC reacts with
a sodium caprolactam anion, and the caprolactam ring is open. Then,
the living anion attacks an ε-caprolactam monomer, extracts
a proton, and generates a new living anion. This new anion acts as
a nucleophile to open the caprolactam ring of a dimer. Thereafter,
a trimer having a living anion is formed, which reacts with another
ε-caprolactam monomer to increase the degree of polymerization.
The chain propagation step continues until the anion is quenched.
Thus, high-molecular-weight PA6 is obtained as long as the living
anion is not quenched. Several investigators have reported the reaction
of amine with caprolactam.21,23,30 Akkapeddi and Gervasi suggested that biscaprolactam can react with
the amine end group of PA6 through two possible mechanisms.29 The reaction mechanisms are shown in Scheme 2. Caprolactam chain
end groups of polymerized PA6 can react with the diamine chain extender,
forming a new PA6 repeating unit by caprolactam ring-opening or directly
associating with formation of a caprolactam by-product.

In AROP of PA6 with an activator, there are some well-known side
reactions that cause branching or cross-linking.31−34 In Scheme 3, it is briefly shown that possible reactions
with a diamine during the polymerization can generate branches. During
propagation and in the initial stage of polymerization, active anions
on the living chain tend to react with activators rather than with
monomers. As a result, the bifunctional activator dangles on the side
position of the living PA6 chain and provides a new growth site for
the production of a branched polymer. The Claisen-type condensation
also produces a branched polymer chain. Stehlíček and
Šebenda reported that two α-C next to the carbonyl group
of polymer chain can be attacked by the lactam anion, and this new
active anion could act as a branching site.34 The branching reaction can occur depending on the composition of
the reactants, structure of activators, polymerization time, and temperature.35,36 Ricco et al. reported that high polymerization temperature and the
bifunctional activator could accelerate the side reaction of PA6.35 Kim et al. observed more occurrences of branching
and cross-linking reactions for the bifunctional activator than the
monofunctional activator due to the dominant Claisen-type condensation
reaction.31

Scheme 3 Reaction Scheme of
Three-Arm Polymer Formation
The viscosity molecular weights of PA6/diamine mixtures are calculated
from the intrinsic viscosity, and the values are given in Table 1. Pure PA6 was well
polymerized. Its molecular weight is 26,800 g/mol, which is lower
than commercial PA6 resins because of the short reaction time in the
laboratory-scale extruder. The molecular weight of PA6/diamine compounds
was increased with a larger molar ratio of diamine to 0.1 but reduced
with more diamine addition.

Amine groups of PDA1 and EDA3 reacted with the caprolactam
end
group of PA6, affecting the whole molecular weight in two ways in
the in situ polymerization. First, it increased the molecular weight
by combining two PA6 chains (Scheme 2). Simultaneously, the molecular weight decreased by
consumption of caprolactam and terminating the chain growth. In anionic
polymerization, living anions on a growing PA6 chain transfer to other
monomers, generating new living anions (Scheme 1). Subsequently, this new anion attacks the
caprolactam ring located at the end of the PA6 chain. As a result,
the PA6 chain length increases just as much as one repeating unit,
and the anion is still alive on the PA6 chain. On the other hand,
the probability that the end groups of the growing PA6 chain react
with the extender increased with increasing extender content. This
means that the length of each growing chain becomes short. Until the
molar ratio of the chain extender reaches 0.1, the molecular weight
increases from 26,800 to 36,500 g/mol. However, if more diamines are
added, the molecular weight decreased to 29,300 g/mol because the
blocking effect is more predominant than the chain extension effect.
However, it should be noticed that the molar mass at the diamine content
of 0.1 is ca. 1.4 times that of PA6, which means that the melt viscosity
is, at best, three times larger than that of PA6 if they follow the
3.4 power law. This implies that another structure is responsible
for the sharp increase in viscosity. In our earlier study, we proposed
that a topological change of polymer chains is the reason for the
large increase in the melt viscosity.13

Figure 1 shows
the
dependence of the complex viscosity on the frequency at different
diamine contents. The melt viscosity for PA6 does not exhibit a broad
Newtonian plateau of low viscosity but a weak shear thinning behavior
over the entire frequency range. This is due to the low branching
during the reactive extrusion without a diamine, possibly by the Claisen-type
condensation reaction because of the high extrusion temperature.35−37 Other PA6/diamine compounds, however, show one order higher viscosity
values than neat PA6 in the whole frequency domain. This propensity
is remarkable at a low frequency range, and all PA6/diamine compounds
show strong shear thinning behavior. It should be noted in Figure 1a,b that the melt
viscosities of in situ-polymerized PA6/diamine compounds increase
with the amount of diamine up to a molar ratio of 0.1 but thereafter
decrease. These phenomena are closely related to the molecular weight
and chain structure of PA6 produced, as discussed later.

viscosities of (a) PA6/PDA1 blends and (b) PA6/EDA3
blends.

In our earlier study, a similar
behavior was observed when a commercial
PA6 was mixed with a diepoxide.13 Although
the molar mass increase was only 1.5-fold, modified PA6 showed two
orders higher viscosity than pure PA6. A huge increase in the melt
viscosity of PA6/diepoxide indicates a topological change in the polymer
chains because a slight increase in the molecular weight cannot incur
such a drastic change in the viscosity if it follows the 3.4 power
law (η ≈ M3.4). The zero
shear viscosity was calculated by fitting the data using the Carreau
equation with the Cox–Merz rule, η(γ)/η0 ≈ (1 + (γτn)2)(n – 1)/2, where η0 is the zero shear rate viscosity, γ
is the shear rate, τn is the characteristic
time, and n is a parameter.38 The zero shear rate viscosity has reached the highest value for
the specimen containing 0.1 ratio diamine. Its zero shear rate viscosity
is surprisingly ca. 30 times higher than that of neat PA6. The zero
shear rate viscosity then decreased as more diamines were added. They
follow almost the same trend regardless of the diamine, although the
EDA3 added has a slightly higher viscosity.

Another notable
change is also seen in the dynamic moduli (storage
modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″)) shown in Figure 2. The storage modulus shows the elastic solid-like behavior,
while the loss modulus shows the viscous response.39 In linear polymer melts, the storage modulus is proportional
to the square of frequency (ω2), and the loss modulus
is proportional to the frequency (ω) in the low-frequency region,
following a linear viscoelastic (LVE) motion.40 However, the power-law dependence of G′
and G″ on the frequency becomes weaker with
the addition of the diamine extender, deviating from the LVE movement.
The loss modulus increased approximately 10-fold over that of PA6
at a molar ratio of 0.1 of the diamine, whereas the storage modulus
increased 30 times over that of neat nylon 6 at a low frequency. After
the molar ratio of 0.1, both moduli decreased similar to the change
in the melt viscosity. It should also be noted that the storage modulus
is higher than the loss modulus in all frequency ranges, which means
that PA6/diamine mixtures have a more solid-like character.39,40

To investigate the presence of cross-linking or branching,
we measured
the chain irregularity with a UV spectrometer. The ODmax value of neat PA6 was 1.5, which was greatly higher than the value
of a typical hydrolytic PA6, which is 0.044.29,36 All other PA6/diamine composites showed extremely high values of
ODmax beyond the UV spectrometer’s analysis range.
This means that, in PA6 including diamines, there is a very high level
of chain irregularity. It is known that cross-linking reactions may
occur in the anionic polymerization of caprolactam if the reaction
temperatures exceed 180 °C and near complete monomer conversion.31,33 However, the PA6 molecules were not significantly cross-linked for
the following reasons. To clearly examine whether the PA6 and its
blends were cross-linked or not, the gel content of PA6 and its mixtures
was extracted with a solvent, 95% formic acid. After the extraction,
there was almost nothing left. This was checked by the particle size
analyzer. The results show that PA6 has a very high level of chain
irregularities but only a small amount of cross-linking structures,
which means that most of them are branching structures.13 Ricco et al. have reported that anionically
synthesized polycaprolactam has Tg and Tm values very close to those of hydrolytic polycaprolactam.
It does not have cross-linked structures and instead exhibits a high
degree of dawning crystallinity and a very low content of γ
form.35 The occurrence of the cross-linking
reaction cannot explain the large increase in the viscosity as well
as the storage modulus since the cross-linked molecule volume is too
small to change the rheological properties so eminently. Once it is
cross-linked, it is infusible in the melt so that the solid content
contribution to the viscosity is insignificant according to the Einstein
equation.41 Furthermore, if it is due to
the cross-linked structure, the rheological properties should continue
to increase as the amount of diamine (PDA1 or EDA3) increases. However,
after the optimum ratio of 0.1 for both diamines, at which the rheological
properties reached their peaks, they were reduced, indicating that
they cannot be reconciled with cross-linking reactions as there will
definitely be more cross-linking reactions with more linking agents
to enhance those properties.13,33,34

For the correct interpretation of the rheological behavior,
the
occurrence of topological structure change is more feasible. The appearance
of branching structure is the most likely since the melt viscosity
of a branched polymer grows exponentially with the molar mass of the
arm (η0 ≈ (Ma/Me)3/2 exp(νMa/Me), where Ma is the arm’s molecular weight, Me is the entanglement molecular weight, and ν is
the constant that is independent of the number of arms, f (3 or 4 gave the same results)).39,42 In our previous
report, the viscosity of the modified PA6 reached 1 × 105 Pa·s because the commercial PA6 molecules whose weight
average molar mass was 8.5 × 104 g/mol with a polydispersity
index of 3.5 reacted to form the modified PA6.13 Since the amount of linking agents in PA6/diepoxide reactive
mixtures was quite small compared to polymer molecules, it is very
likely that a branched structure was formed instead of the cross-linking
structure.7,42 The growing caprolactam anion can attack
the amine group of diamines (Schemes 2 and 3). The connection of two
growing PA6 molecules into one through the diamine can increase the
molar mass, which can lead to more chain entanglements and higher
viscosity due to slow relaxation (Scheme 2). The anion attack can occur on the same
amine group or on both amine groups of diamines. The first case induces
another reaction on the other amine group to form three or four branched
molecules (Scheme 3). However, a steric interference in the three-arm molecule can prevent
the formation of the four-armed molecule. In our experiments, slightly
branched PA6 was easily generated due to the relatively high temperature
and shear rate polymerization conditions in the extruder and the use
of a bifunctional activator. Branched polymers require greater strain
to untangle the molecules and allow them to flow, resulting in a large
increase in the storage modulus and loss modulus.39,42

The DSC scanning result for heating of the PA6/diamine mixtures
is listed in Table 1. Upon introduction of the diamine, both the enthalpy of melting
(ΔHm) and crystallinity (Xc) were reduced, but the melting temperature
did not show a notable change. It indicates that the crystallization
of PA6 was hampered by the branching structure. Similar results have
been already reported with different kinds of linear chain extenders.7,43,44 In those studies, the decrease
in crystallinity was attributed to the increase in molecular weight,
which hinders the arrangement of macromolecules in a crystalline phase.
The decrease in crystallinity was largely affected by the increase
in molecular weight and the hindrance by the chain branching. To investigate
the crystalline structures, WAXD analysis was performed, and the results
are shown in Figure 3 and Table 1. The
WAXD spectra for PA6/EDA3 mixtures showed two sharp characteristic
peaks at 2θ = 20° and 23°. Both peaks correspond to
the reflection of the α-crystalline planes (200) and (002) +
(202), respectively.35 There are no other
peaks observed in WAXD profiles such as the γ-crystalline peak,
which exists at 2θ = 21.5° corresponding to the (001) plane.31 The crystallinity dropped from 43.1% for neat
PA6 to 35.0–39.0% for diamine-added PA6. This indicates that
the branched structure hindered the crystallization of PA6, consistent
with the DSC results, but its structure was the same as the main chain
of PA6. Therefore, the synthesized polymer can be recycled as normal
PA6, which is helpful to reduce the environmental issue.

Figure 3 WAXD spectrum
of PA6/EDA3 blends.

The mechanical properties
of the PA6s with different molar ratios
of diamines are shown in Figure 4. Both diamine-added PA6s show almost the same behavior.
Until the molar ratio became 0.1, the tensile modulus and tensile
strength increased with the addition of diamines due to the enhanced
molecular weight. Generally, modulus and tensile strength of linear
polymers are reduced as the crystallinity decreases. Despite the reduction
of crystallinity, however, the modulus and tensile strength of all
PA6s were improved with the addition of diamine since the molecular
weight and the number of branched molecules were increased and more
chain entanglements occurred.42,43 Chain entanglements
increased with molecular weights and formed branches that lead to
significant improvement in elongation at break. This is different
from Steeman and Nijenhuis’s report.14 They measured the rheological and mechanical properties of a series
of linear and randomly branched PA6 samples. The mechanical properties
show minor differences between the linear and moderately branched
samples. Although the yield stress and tensile modulus of the branched
PA6 were 10–15% higher than those of linear PA6, there was
a minor loss of yield strain. This can be due to the difference in
the number of branches. Their PA6 can have more branches than the
current study. The branching structure proposed in this study can
affect the entanglements between chains. Thus, the energy absorbed
to break (modulus of toughness or tensile toughness) was nearly tripled
due to the improved ductility of the modified PA6 and the improved
tensile modulus. After the mechanical properties of the modified PA6
reached the peaks, they were decreased as the amount of diamines exceeded
the molar ratio of 0.1. However, for those PA6s including diamines
with a molar ratio of more than 0.1, the mechanical properties of
the blends were still superior to those of neat PA6, which is plausibly
due to the formation of a branched structure. The more diamines added
that exceeded the 0.1 molar ratio, the more quenching of the propagation
reaction occurs, and the molecular weight becomes low to show reduced
performance, although the modified PA6 is still better than the neat
PA6.

strength, (c) elongation at break, and (d) modulus of toughness (rupture

Conclusions
In this study, we successfully
polymerized PA6 with diamines by
reactive extrusion from the ε-caprolactam monomer. Two different
diamines were added, but the products showed nearly the same physical
properties and similar molecular weights regardless of diamines, suggesting
that their reactivity and the reaction mechanism were almost alike.
In the extruder, ε-caprolactam completely reacted to form a
PA6 polymer composite without any residual monomers. PA6 containing
diamines showed a highly increased melt viscosity and stronger shear
thinning effect than neat PA6 over the entire frequency range. It
was induced by increased molecular weight and chain entanglements
due to the chain branching. The storage modulus and loss modulus also
showed more solid-like behavior and increased with the concentration
of diamine. All rheological properties were increased until the molar
ratio of diamines to initiator reached 0.1. After then, further addition
of diamines show deteriorated rheological properties due to the quenching
effect of diamines. PA6 molecules possibly formed branched structures
during the polymerization because of the added diamines, high polymerization
temperature, high shear rate in the extruder, and the bifunctional
activator. PA6 chains were connected and/or formed the branched structures,
which led to an increase in molecular weight as well as more entanglements.
Beyond the optimum amount of diamine concentrations (0.1 molar ratio
of the initiator), the molecular weight decreased because of the quenching
effect of diamines.

The mechanical properties of the diamines
including PA6 were significantly
improved with the diamine addition until the molar ratio reached 0.1.
In particular, the elongation at break and the breaking stress were
significantly increased. After the optimum amount, the mechanical
properties decrease due to the reduced molecular weight and/or the
reduction of branching structure but still better than those of linear
PA6. The addition of diamines to produce randomly branched PA6 molecules
enables us to obtain PA6 resins with superior rheological and mechanical
properties that are unattainable for linear PA6 to open up new opportunities
for wider applications. Produced PA6 has a merit of processibility
in the extrusion process such as a blow molding process in which stability
against sagging under gravity is required and other processes where
elongational properties dominate. Also, the synthesized polymer has
the same repeating units as PA6 to let them be recycled as normal
PA6. This can be helpful to reduce the environmental issue.

Experimental
Section
Materials
ε-Caprolactam used in this study was
procured from Capro Corporation (Korea). Sodium hydride, terephthaloyl
chloride, triethylamine, pyridine, resorcinol, p-phenylenediamine
(PDA1), 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride, and activated Pd-carbon (10%) were
purchased from Aldrich. TBC was synthesized by the reaction of terephthaloyl
chloride with caprolactam in benzene.23 3-(4-Aminobenzoyloxy)phenyl 4-aminobenzoate (EDA3) was synthesized
according to the method reported previously (see Figure 5 for chemical structures of
TBS, PDA1, and EDA3).24

(a) TBC, (b) PDA1, and (c) EDA3.

Synthesis of Sodium Caprolactam (Na-CL)
ε-Caprolactam
was dried for 24 h at 100 °C in a convection oven and vacuum-dried
at 50 °C for 48 h to remove the moisture completely. First, 1
mol of dried ε-caprolactam was placed in the round flask under
an argon atmosphere. After ε-caprolactam was completely melted
at 70 °C, 0.05 mol of sodium hydride was added with stirring.
After the hydrogen emission was ceased, the mixture was stirred for
10 min under an argon atmosphere to complete the reaction. The mixture
was cooled to room temperature and pulverized. Sodium caprolactam
powder was stored in a container filled with argon.

In Situ Polymerization
by Reactive Extrusion
The reactant
mixture consisted of ε-caprolactam, sodium caprolactam, TBS,
and diamines used as a monomer, an initiator, an activator, and additives,
respectively. The monomer/initiator/activator molar ratio was optimized
as 50:1:0.5 in preliminary experiments for both high polymer yields
and short polymerization times. The molar ratio of diamine content
to initiator varied as 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 for each sample. The
reactant mixtures were fed into a twin screw extruder (BA-19, Bautech),
while argon was flowing to prevent quenching of active anions due
to moisture during polymerization. The temperature profile from the
feeding zone to the die was set to 140/180/200/220/220/230/240 °C,
and the screw speed was set to 50 rpm. The extruded diamine-containing
PA6 was pelletized and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for sufficient
time before characterization.

Characterization
Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC 823e, METTLER TOLEDO) was used to analyze the thermal properties
of PA6/diamine compounds. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the sample
was first heated from 25 to 280 °C at 10 °C/min, cooled
to 25 °C, and heated to 280 °C at the same heating rate.
The degree of crystallinity (Xc) was calculated
using the following equation.  where ΔHm is the specific enthalpy of melting, and ΔH100 is the enthalpy of melting with 100% crystalline
nylon
6 (190 J/g).25

WAXD (D8 Advance,
Bruker Miller Co.) was used to analyze the crystalline order of the
produced PA6. Prior to measurement, pelletized PA6 particles were
hot-pressed at 240 °C and cooled to room temperature to obtain
a film. The spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a diffraction
angle (2θ) of 5°–40° with CuK α radiation.
The intrinsic viscosity [η] was measured, and the viscosity
average molecular weight was calculated. The Ubbelohde viscometer
was used to check the time for polymer solution to pass through the
capillary with 90% formic acid solution at 25 °C. Using the Mark–Houwink
equation, the molecular weight of PA6 resin was calculated as [η]
= k[M]a. The Mark–Houwink constants were k = 22.6
× 10–3 (mL/g) and a = 0.82
for nylon 6 at 25 °C in a 90% formic acid solution.26 Rheological properties were studied using Advanced
Rheometric Expansion System (ARES, Rheometric Scientific). Samples
were prepared by injection molding at 240 °C in a mold of 25
mm diameter and 1 mm thickness. Dynamic moduli (storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″))
and complex viscosity were measured between parallel plates at 250
°C with an applied strain of 10% and angular frequency from 0.05
to 500 rad/s. The degree of cross-linking was determined using a solvent
extraction method (ASTM D2765) by m-cresol for 20
h of reflux.27 A UV spectrometer (Agilent
8453 UV–Vis system) was used to analyze the chain regularities
in PA6 chains. The presence of structural irregularities in PA6 chains
can be absorbed in the UV region with the optical density maximum
(ODmax) at 270–280 nm.28 PA6 solutions (1 wt %) in formic acid were prepared, and the UV
absorption was measured between 250 and 400 nm (1 cm path length).
