The
wide applications of nanomaterials in industry and our daily
life have raised growing concerns on their toxicity to human body.
Increasing evidence links the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles to the
disruption of cellular signaling pathways. Here, we report a computational
study on the mechanisms of the cytotoxicity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
by investigating the direct impacts of CNTs on the functional motions
of calmodulin (CaM), which is one of the most important signaling
proteins in a cell, and its signaling function relies on the Ca2+ binding-coupled conformational switching. Computational
simulations with a coarse-grained model showed that binding of CNTs
modifies the conformational equilibrium of CaM and induces the closed-to-open
conformational transition, leading to the loss of its Ca2+-sensing ability. In addition, the binding of CNTs drastically increases
the calcium affinity of CaM, which may disrupt the Ca2+ homeostasis in a cell. These results suggest that the binding of
hydrophobic nanotubes not only inhibits the signaling function of
CaM as a calcium sensor but also renders CaM to toxic species through
sequestering Ca2+ from other competing calcium-binding
proteins, suggesting a new physical mechanism of the cytotoxicity
of nanoparticles.

Introduction
Nanomaterials have
been widely used in modern industry and biomedical
fields because of their unique physical and chemical properties.1 However, the increasing environmental exposure
to nanomaterials also raised public concerns regarding the possible
toxicity to human body. Cumulative evidences showed that nanoscale
particles may cause damages to the respiratory system, nervous system,
and even cardiovascular system.2−7 Large-scale exposure may also produce physiological responses, such
as inflammation, epithelioid granulomas, and fibrosis.6−9 Consequently, there is an urgent need to investigate the molecular
mechanisms of the biological toxicity of nanoparticles, which is very
important for designing biologically compatible nanomaterials to reduce
their adverse biological effects.

There are several possible
ways that nanoparticles can lead to
toxicity to a cell. Previous studies mainly focus on the effects of
oxidative stress and the subsequent DNA damage induced by nanoparticles.3,5,6,9,10 In recent years, direct interactions between
nanoparticles and biomolecules attract much attention.11−18 Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and spectroscopic experimental
measurements suggested that the nonspecific hydrophobic interactions
between nanoparticles and the hydrophobic residues of proteins tend
to disrupt and block the active sites and competitively inhibit the
binding of the target proteins.6,11,17−20

CaM is a calcium-binding signaling protein expressed in all
eukaryotic
cells. It has two symmetrically arranged globular domains connected
by a flexible central linker21−23 (Figure 1). Each CaM domain is composed of two helix–loop–helix
Ca2+-binding motifs (EF-hands). In the absence of Ca2+, the two helices of the EF-hand motif are nearly parallel
to each other and the whole domain adopts a closed conformation with
the hydrophobic residues deeply buried. Binding of two Ca2+ at each domain switches the closed conformation to open conformation,
in which the helices of the EF-hand motif become perpendicular to
each other and the hydrophobic patches are largely exposed to the
solvent, facilitating the binding of downstream target proteins which
also have conserved hydrophobic residues.21,24−26 Such Ca2+ binding-induced conformational
switching of CaM is the key step of Ca2+ signal transduction
and has been utilized in regulating a number of biological processes,
including muscle contraction, metabolism, apoptosis, immune response,
and so on.27,28 Because of its critical role
in regulating cell processes and well-organized hydrophobic patches,
CaM has been considered to be one of the main targets that the exogenous
hydrophobic nanoparticles bind with.17 Previous
all-atom MD simulations showed that a carbon nanotube (CNT) can plug
into the hydrophobic patch of the CaM domains with high affinity and
occupy the binding site of the target proteins.17 These previous computational and experimental works inspired
us to further investigate the effects of CNT binding on the functional
dynamics of CaM, including Ca2+ binding, allosteric motions,
and target protein recognitions, by which we can get deeper understanding
of the molecular mechanism of the nanotoxicity of hydrophobic nanoparticles.

Figure 1 Schematic
diagram showing the steps of calcium signal transduction
mediated by calmodulin (CaM). Upon Ca2+ binding, the CaM
domains undergo closed-to-open conformational change, exposing their
hydrophobic pocket for the binding of downstream target proteins.
Here, only the helix responsible for the CaM binding is shown for
the target protein. The binding of the hydrophobic nanotube can disrupt
the signaling pathway, thereby leading to cytotoxicity.

Because of the tremendous degrees of freedom involved,
the timescale
of conformational changes and calcium binding of CaM is far beyond
the accessible scope of conventional all-atom MD simulations. To overcome
such timescale difficulty, in this work, we constructed a coarse-grained
(CG) model to integratedly describe the Ca2+ binding, conformational
motions, target recognition, and CNT binding by MD simulations within
the framework of the dynamic energy landscape theory.29 Recently, such a CG model has been successfully applied
in studying the Ca2+ binding-coupled folding, allosteric
motions, and target recognition of CaM by several laboratories.30−33 Our simulations revealed that the CNT tends to bind at the same
binding site of the target protein and therefore can inhibit the target
recognition by competitive interactions. In addition, we showed that
the CNT binding modifies the conformational equilibrium of CaM, which
is highly biased to the active open conformation, leading to the loss
of the responding ability of Ca2+. More interestingly,
the conformational switch induced by the CNT binding increases the
Ca2+ binding probability by nearly six folds, which may
disrupt the calcium homeostasis in a cell. These results suggest that
the hydrophobic nanotube binding not only inhibits the signaling function
of CaM as a calcium sensor but also renders CaM to toxic species through
sequestering the calcium ions from other competing calcium-binding
proteins because of the increased Ca2+ affinity.

Results
Impacts
of CNT Binding on the Conformational Equilibrium of
the CaM Domain
An appropriate conformational equilibrium
of CaM is the key to its biological function. Experimental measurements
showed that CaM is dominated by closed conformation in the absence
of Ca2+.33−36 Binding of Ca2+ shifts the conformational equilibrium,
leading to the dominance of active open conformation. Here, we investigated
how the CNT binding affects the functional dynamics of the CaM domains.
For this purpose, we conducted MD simulations for a system containing
the isolated C-terminal domain of CaM (CaMc) and the CNT(5,5) with
the Ca2+ concentration of 1.0 μM. The simulation
was performed with the interaction strength between the CNT and CaMc
optimized according to atomic MD simulations (ϵHP = 0.4 kcal/mol). As a control, we conducted additional simulations
in which the attractive component of the interactions between CaMc
and CNT was removed, so that the binding of CNT to CaMc is eliminated.
We used the reaction coordinates RMSDopen, RMSDclosed, Qopen, and Qclosed to characterize the conformations of CaMc. RMSDopen (RMSDclosed) is the root-mean-square deviation from the open (closed)
conformation. Qopen (Qclosed) is the fraction of the formed native contacts
in a given structure, with the open (closed) conformation used as
the reference native structure, and varies between 0 and 1. The higher
value of Qopen (Qclosed) represents that the conformation of a given structure
is more open (closed)-like. We can see that without CNT binding, CaMc
hops between the closed (with larger RMSDopen values) and
open (with smaller RMSDopen values) states frequently (Figure 2a), with the latter
being more dominantly populated. In addition, CaM can become unfolded
occasionally. The two-dimensional free-energy landscape along the
reaction coordinates Qopen and Qclosed shows three basins, corresponding to
the open (UO, see figure caption), closed (UC), and unfolded states,
with the inactive closed state having the lowest free energy (Figure 2c). Such results
are consistent with our previous work for the same protein.30 In comparison, for the system with CNT–CaMc
interactions, the CNT tends to bind with CaMc. Once bound, the conformational
fluctuation of CaMc is much suppressed, and the active open conformation
becomes dominant (see Figure 2b,d). A more detailed analysis showed that upon the binding
of the CNT, the closed conformation is rarely visited. Instead, CaMc
hops between the active open conformation (BO) and a distorted conformation
(BD). In this distorted conformation, helices are closely wrapped
around the CNT, with the helical content remaining intact (Figure 2g). These results
suggest that the binding of the CNT shifts the conformational equilibrium
and biases the conformational distribution of the CaM domains to the
open state. Apparently, the suppression of the functionally relevant
conformational motions arising from the binding of the CNT can lead
to cell dysfunction, contributing to the cytotoxicity of CNT.

of the representative conformations. State labels: UO, CNT-unbound
open conformation; UC, CNT-unbound closed conformation; BO, CNT-bound

To more clearly demonstrate the conformational dynamics of
CaM
and the binding mechanism between the CNT and CaMc, we plotted two-dimensional
free-energy landscapes along the reaction coordinates RMSDopen and HC (Figure 2e)
and along the reaction coordinates RMSDclosed and HC (Figure 2f). Here, the reaction
coordinate HC is the number of hydrophobic contacts between CaMc and
the CNT, which monitors the extent of wrapping of the CaMc helices
around the CNT. One can see that at the physiologically relevant calcium
concentration (1.0 μM), the CNT binds first to the closed conformation
of CaM (BC) with a small number of contacts between the CNT and CaMc.
This conformation corresponds to a transient state and occurs only
at the early stage of CNT binding. Then, driven by hydrophobic interactions,
the CNT occupies the hydrophobic patch of CaMc, leading to the formation
of more hydrophobic contacts between the CNT and CaMc. Interestingly,
CaMc with the CNT bound at its hydrophobic patch hops between the
open conformation (which favors intraprotein interactions) and the
distorted conformation (which favors CNT–CaMc interactions),
demonstrating the competition between intraprotein interactions and
CNT–CaMc interactions.

Impacts of CNT Binding
on the Ca2+ Affinity of the
CaM Domain
Undoubtedly, the alteration of the conformational
equilibrium of CaMc by CNT binding will affect its Ca2+-binding ability. Figure 3a,b shows two representative trajectories monitoring the binding
energies of the two Ca2+-binding sites with and without
CNT binding at the Ca2+ concentration of 1.0 μM.
One can see that the calcium ions can bind and unbind reversibly.
However, upon CNT binding, the dissociation of Ca2+ becomes
much slower, leading to increased Ca2+ dwelling time and
affinity. To more quantitatively characterize such an effect, we conducted
additional simulations with different Ca2+ concentrations.
As shown in Figure 3c, at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations, the binding
of the CNT can significantly enhance the population and the dwelling
time of the Ca2+-bound state, leading to an increased binding
affinity. Particularly, at physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations (∼1.0 μM), the population of the Ca2+-bound state can be enhanced by approximately six folds.
Such an effect of CNT binding on the Ca2+ affinity is easy
to understand, as the CNT binding tends to stabilize the open conformation
of CaMc, in which the residues of the binding site are more compatible
with the Ca2+ coordination geometry, and therefore has
higher Ca2+ affinity, compared to the closed conformation.22 As the Ca2+ concentrations in living
cells are strictly regulated, the coexistence of the normal CaM and
CNT-bound CaM may introduce a crosstalk between the two species. Because
of the much higher Ca2+ affinity, the population of the
CNT-bound CaM may destroy the Ca2+ homeostasis in a cell
by making Ca2+ compete with the normal CaM and other Ca2+-binding proteins. As a result, the normal CaM may lose the
ability to transduct the Ca2+ signal, leading to cell dysfunction.
These results suggest that the hydrophobic nanotube may impose cell
toxicity by two possible mechanisms at the molecular level, including
(i) modifying the conformational equilibrium of the CaM domains, therefore
disrupting its Ca2+-sensing ability and (ii) enhancing
the calcium affinity of the CNT-bound CaM and disrupting the calcium
homeostasis in the cell.

of CaMc as a function of [Ca2+] without (red) and with
(blue) CNT binding. The [Ca2+] at which the population
of the Ca2+-bound state equals to 0.5 can be used to characterize
the calcium-binding affinity. Here, the population of the calcium-bound
states was calculated without distinguishing the two sites.

Effects of the CaMc–CNT
Interaction Strength
In the above discussions, the interaction
strength between CaMc and
CNT was optimized according to the all-atom force field, as described
in the Method section, which represents the
situation of the intact CNT. However, in practice, such interaction
strengths can be modified by different oxidation extents or constituting
elements of the hydrophobic nanotube.12 Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how the above-discussed
effect of nanotube binding on the CaM conformation and Ca2+ affinity can be modulated by interaction strengths. For this purpose,
we conduct simulations at a wide range of interaction strengths (ϵHP ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 kcal/mol) and Ca2+ concentrations.
A detailed analysis of MD trajectories shows that the effects of the
interaction strength can be complex and tightly coupled with the calcium
concentration. With the increase of the interaction strength, the
mostly populated conformation changes from the closed conformation
to open conformation and distorted conformation.

To more quantitatively
characterize the effect of CNT binding on the conformational distribution,
we calculated the population for each of the above states with different
interaction strengths and Ca2+ concentrations. As expected,
the CNT is more likely to be bound with CaMc with a higher CaMc–CNT
interaction strength (Figure S1). With
the increase of ϵHP from 0 to 0.3 kcal/mol, the population
of the CNT–CaMc complex increases from 0 to 1.0. The population
of the CNT–CaMc complex is less sensitive to [Ca2+]. Figure 4a–c
shows the results of the populations of the open state (a), closed
state (b), and distorted state (c), represented by a color map. According
to the populations of these states, we can further construct the phase
diagram projected onto the two collective variables represented by
Ca2+ concentration and interaction strength (Figure 4d). One can see that when the
interaction strength is weak and Ca2+ concentration is
low, the closed state is dominant, whereas at intermediate interaction
strengths (e.g., ϵHP ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 kcal/mol,
which includes the interaction strength for the standard hydrophobic
CNT), the open state is dominant at the whole range of Ca2+ concentrations. With a further increase of the interaction strength,
the distorted state is more populated.

CaMc domain. (a–c) Color maps showing the populations of CaMc
with open (a), closed (b), and distorted states (c) with different
[Ca2+] and interaction strengths ϵHP between
CaMc and CNT. (d) Phase diagram of the CaMc conformation. The boundaries
correspond to the location of the parameter values which give the
equal populations of the neighboring states.

We plotted the populations of the calcium-bound conformations
on
the same space (Figure 5a). When the CaMc–CNT interaction is weak, the calcium-bound
state can be significantly populated only at high calcium concentrations,
whereas at the range of ϵHP = 0.2–0.4 kcal/mol,
the calcium-bound state can be significantly populated even at low
calcium concentrations, which is consistent with the results shown
in Figure 3 that CNT
binding enhances the calcium affinity. When the interaction strength
is stronger, which corresponds to the distorted conformation, the
population of the calcium-bound state is reduced again. The calcium
binding is probable only at very high calcium concentrations in this
case. Such a reduced calcium affinity suggests that the calcium-binding
pockets have been distorted because of the strong CNT–CaMc
interactions.

(e) states. (f) Cartoon representation of a representative conformation

Effects of the CNT Binding on the Full-Length CaM
As
CaM has two nearly symmetrically arranged domains, it is interesting
to investigate the effect of CNT binding on the conformational distributions
and calcium affinity of the two component domains of the intact CaM.
We conducted additional simulations for the full-length CaM. Figure 5b,c shows the Ca2+-binding affinities of the CaMn and CaMc domains of the full-length
CaM at a wide range of [Ca2+] and ϵHP values.
The obtained two-dimensional free-energy landscapes were similar to
that of the isolated CaMc (see Figure 5a) except for two details. First, at the same [Ca2+], the Ca2+-binding probability of the CaMn domain
was obviously lower than that of the CaMc domain, which is in accordance
with the fact that CaMc has a higher Ca2+ affinity than
CaMn as observed in previous experimental and computational works.30,37 Second, compared to the isolated CaMc domain, CaMc of the full-length
CaM has a much higher Ca2+ binding probability event at
larger ϵHP values. A more detailed analysis showed
that in the full-length simulations, because of the competition between
the two CaM domains for the hydrophobic CNT atoms, the interactions
between the individual domain and the CNT are much reduced (Figure S1). Such an elimination of interactions
makes the population of the distorted conformation less probable,
leading to higher stability of the open state and increased calcium-binding
affinity.

We also studied the specific sequence of conformational
changes of the two CaM domains starting from the closed structure
in the presence of CNT. The results showed that the CaMn and CaMc
domains change their conformations from the closed to open states
with similar rates at a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations.
Consequently, two pathways, in which either the CaMn or the CaMc domain
changes the conformation first, are possible and have comparable probabilities.

The above simulation results demonstrate that the conformational
distributions of the CNT-bound CaMc are determined by the interplay
of intradomain interactions, Ca2+ binding energies, and
the CNT binding energies. From the closed state to the open state
and distorted state, the overall intradomain interactions are eliminated
gradually, which is accompanied by an increase of the CNT–CaMc
hydrophobic interactions (Figure S1b).
At the same time, the calcium binding tends to stabilize the open
conformation. These three factors together determine the responding
ability of CaMc to Ca2+ concentrations. Notably, at ϵHP = 0.2–0.4, the CNT binding has the most significant
effect on the Ca2+ binding and may suggest high toxicity,
which covers the realistic interaction strength (0.4 kcal/mol) for
the standard hydrophobic CNT without oxidation, as estimated by matching
the data of CG simulations with those obtained in previous atomic
MD simulations (Figure S2).38 Previous circular dichroism experiments also
supported that CNTs tend to lock the conformation of CaM rather than
destroy the overall structure.17 Interestingly,
the CNT occupies the same binding site as that of the target protein
CaMKI for the full-length CaM as shown in Figure 5f,g, which also suggests that the CNT can
also introduce toxicity to CaM by competing with the target protein
for binding with CaM, which is consistent with previous computational
studies with atomic MD simulations.17 In
addition, the CNT binding leads to an interdomain rearrangement compared
to the conformations of the isolated CaM (Figure 5a,b), demonstrating the CNT binding-induced
conformational change of CaM.

Size Effect of the Hydrophobic
Nanotube
CNTs with different
sizes can have different impacts on the CaM structures as demonstrated
in a recent work.17 Here, we conducted
additional MD simulations, investigating the conformational equilibrium
and Ca2+ affinity of CaM in the presence of varisized CNTs
(from CNT(3,3) to CNT(9,9)). All simulations were conducted at [Ca2+] = 1.0 μM and ϵHP = 0.4 kcal/mol.
As shown in Figure 6a,b, increasing CNT sizes tends to decrease both the Ca2+ affinity and the population of the open conformation, particularly
for CNT sizes larger than CNT(6,6). Consequently, CNTs with sizes
smaller than CNT(6,6) have the most significant impacts on calcium
binding. As the calcium-binding sites are far apart from the hydrophobic
patch for CNT binding, the decrease of the calcium affinity does not
arise from direct interactions between the calcium-binding sites and
CNTs but from the destabilization of the open conformation, which
has higher calcium affinity. Such an interplay between the destabilization
of the open conformation and the decreased calcium affinity as the
CNT size increases can also be demonstrated by the strong correlation
between the populations of the calcium-binding state and the open
conformation, as shown in Figure 6c,d for CaMn and CaMc of the full-length CaM. A more
detailed analysis showed when the CNT size is larger than CNT(7,7),
the bound CNT is not compatible with the hydrophobic pocket of CaM,
leading to the distortion of the overall CaM structure. Therefore,
the impact of CNTs with larger sizes is similar to that of graphene
sheets, which can distort the structures of peptides and proteins
like protein G upon binding.18,39

Conclusions
In
this work, to study the molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxicity
of hydrophobic nanotubes, we constructed a CG model that can integratedly
describe the conformational motions, calcium binding, and CNT interactions
of the signaling protein CaM with a much longer timescale than that
accessible by conventional all-atom MD simulations. Such a CG model
enables the direct simulations of the impacts of CNT binding on the
functionally relevant signaling dynamics of CaM. Our results suggest
that there are three possible mechanisms by which the CNT binding
can lead to the dysfunction of the CaM-based signal transduction,
namely (1) inhibiting the target recognition by competitive interactions,
which is consistent with previous observations;17 (2) modifying the conformational equilibrium of CaM; and
(3) increasing the calcium affinity and therefore disrupting the calcium
homeostasis. The mechanism (3) is particularly interesting and implies
that the CNT binding not only disrupts the signaling function of CaM
as a calcium sensor but also renders CaM to toxic species through
sequestering the calcium ions from other competing calcium-binding
proteins because of the increased calcium affinity. Our results provide
new insights into the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxicity of hydrophobic
nanoparticles.

Method
The calcium exchange and
conformational motions of CaM involve
the timescale of milliseconds, which is far beyond the accessible
timescale of conventional atomistic MD simulations. To overcome the
timescale difficulty, we used a CG multibasin model30 to simulate the conformational motions of CaM. In this
model, the residues of CaM are represented by spherical beads located
at the Cα positions. The energy function of the multibasin
model is given by40 1  Here, R collectively represents
the coordinates of the residues in a protein and R0 is the coordinate of the reference structure. V(R|R0open) and V(R|R0closed) are the structure-based potentials centric
to the open and closed structures, respectively, and are constructed
within the framework of the energy landscape theory.29 Previous experimental measurements and computational studies
showed that the conformational motions of the two individual domains
involve two-state transitions.33,35 The above double-basin
potentials were used separately for the two individual domains and
their interface of CaM. In addition, the interdomain rearrangement
is mainly controlled by the interactions arising from the CNT binding,
which does not rely on the double-basin potential as will be described
in the subsequent discussions. The atomic interaction-based CG model
(AICG2+), which has been successfully used in simulating the large-amplitude
conformational motions and folding of allosteric proteins and large
protein complexes in previous works,30,41−43 was used in constructing structure-based potentials. The energy
function of the AICG2+ force field is given by 2  

The energy function includes the bond potential
(Vbond), flexible local potential (Vlocflp), structure-based
local and nonlocal terms (Vlocnat and Vnlocnat), and the
excluded volume term. Details of the above terms can be found in ref (30).

In eq 1, ΔV controls
the conformational equilibrium of the open and
closed states. Here, the values given in ref (30) were used. For the CaMc
domain, the experimental data showed that at the apo condition, the
population of the open conformation is around 5–10%.35 In ref (30), we showed that a ΔV value of −3.8
kcal/mol can well reproduce the experimental data. For CaMn, the populations
of the conformations at the apo condition were not very well defined
experimentally. A ΔV value of 1.0 kcal/mol
was used, which leads to the same conformational distribution as that
of CaMc. The parameter Δ controls the barrier height of the
opening/closing transitions, and its value was chosen such that one
can observe frequent conformational transitions within a reasonable
simulation time.

Ca2+ was considered implicitly with
the energetic effect
of ligand binding being modeled as attractive interactions between
the residues of the binding site. The binding energy of one calcium-binding
pocket is given by44 3  where ϵlig was set as 2.2
kcal/mol, with which CaM dominantly stays at an open conformation
after Ca2+ binding, consistent with the experimental observations.22,23,45 σ represents the width
of the Gaussian potential for the ligand-mediated contacts and was
set as 0.15 Å. rij0 is the distance between
ligand residues in the native conformation. The transitions between
the Ca2+-bound and unbound states were realized by standard
Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, Ca2+ binding
is assumed to be diffusion-limited and occurs with the rate kon[Ca2+], where kon is the second-order rate constant and [Ca2+] is the calcium concentration. The Ca2+ dissociation
rate is given by koff0 exp(−Vbind/kBT). The values of
the parameters kon and koff were taken from ref (30), where Vbind is
the binding energy that depends on the conformations of the binding
site and kBT is the thermal
energy. The Ca2+ binding/unbinding leads to switching of
the overall energy function, and the conformational motions and CNT
binding of CaM are dictated by the dynamic energy landscape. On the
other hand, the CNT binding modifies the relative populations of the
open and closed conformations of the two individual domains and therefore
the Ca2+-binding energies, which in turn modulate the rate
of Ca2+ dissociation. Such an implicit Ca2+ binding
model has been successfully used in previous works to reproduce and
explain a number of experimental works on the Ca2+ binding-coupled
folding and the conformational motions of CaM.30,46

CNTs were represented by all-atom structures, with the bonds,
angles,
and dihedral angles being restrained to the standard values by harmonic
potentials. The atoms of CNTs interact with the hydrophobic residues
of CaM by the following Lennard–Jones potential 4  where rij0 = (σi + σj)/2,
with σi and σj being the radii of the residue i of CaM and the carbon atom j of CNT, respectively.
The radius of the hydrophobic residues is taken from CafeMol.47 The radius of the carbon atoms is taken from
the force field AMBER99SB.48 A single-wall
CNT was used in the simulation. The interactions between the carbon
atoms of the CNT and all nonhydrophobic residues are given by the
excluded volume term. The interaction strength ϵHP between CNT atoms and CaM residues is determined by matching the
potentials of mean force between a short peptide Gly–Phe–Gly
and a graphene sheet calculated by previous all-atom MD simulations
(Figure S2).38 Such CaM–CNT interactions dictate the interdomain rearrangements
of CaM and do not rely on the double-basin potentials discussed above.
It is worth noting that π–π interactions have crucial
contribution to the interactions between CNTs and proteins as discussed
in previous works.17,19,38 In the above CG model, all hydrophobic residues have the same interaction
strength with CNT atoms. Therefore, the current CNT–CaM interaction
potential can only distinguish the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues,
which limits its application to discuss in more detail the sequence
dependence of CNT–CaM interactions. In our simulations, the
CNT and CaM (or its isolated domains) are put into a cubic box with
a size of 130 Å × 130 Å × 130 Å. We note
that the resultant CNT–CaM concentration with the above box
size is much higher than the typical experimental values, which may
lead to fast binding between the CNT and CaM. All simulations were
conducted by the software CafeMol with Langevin dynamics at a temperature
of 300 K.47
