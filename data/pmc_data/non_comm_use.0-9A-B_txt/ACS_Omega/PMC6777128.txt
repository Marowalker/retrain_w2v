A ligand-promoted iridium-catalyzed
transfer hydrogenation of terminal
alkynes with ethanol and its application has been developed. Highly
chemical selectivity control is achieved based on ligand regulation.
1,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane was found to be critical for the
transfer hydrogenation of alkynes. The general applicability of this
procedure is highlighted by the synthesis of 30 terminal alkenes with
a good yield. In addition, we conducted drug effect studies of phenelzine
using zebrafish as the vertebrate model. Phenelzine shows a significant
effect on promoting vascular proliferation and inhibiting nerve growth.
The results of these studies have an important reference value for
promoting drug research in cerebrovascular diseases, epilepsy, mania,
and psychosis.

Introduction
Transfer hydrogenation
of unsaturated compounds has attracted much
attention due to its widespread use in the synthesis of synthetic
intermediates, natural products, fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and
agrochemical products.1 To date, several
catalytic systems applicable to alkyne transfer hydrogenation,2 represented by Lindlar reduction,3 have been reported. Among all the transfer hydrogenation,
the metal-catalyzed transfer semireduction is attracting much attention
because of its critical advantage over the conventional semihydrogenation
method,4 which suffers from problems with
overreduction as well as safety concerns.5 While effective, these methods often employ flammable, explosive,
corrosive, or expensive hydrogenation reagents (Scheme 1), in short do not conform to the current
standards of sustainable chemistry. Therefore, the development of
methods that use cheap, safe, and convenient reagents is highly desirable.
Undoubtedly, ethanol (EtOH) is the best choice for a transfer hydrogenation
agent, and the development of methods for synthesizing alkenes with
EtOH as the hydrogen source is desirable. Very recently, Grützmacher,6 Swamy,7 and Huang8 reported an elegant work for transfer hydrogenation
with EtOH. Unfortunately, the semihydrogenation of terminal alkynes
cannot be achieved by all three systems. Subsequently, our research
group developed a method for ligand-controlled iridium-catalyzed semihydrogenation
of alkynes with EtOH: highly stereoselective synthesis of E- and Z-alkenes.9 However, the reaction temperature of this method is harsh, and there
is no systematic investigation of the terminal acetylene substrate.
Herein, we report an example of ligand-promoted iridium-catalyzed
transfer hydrogenation of terminal alkynes with EtOH and its application
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Different
Strategies for Transfer Hydrogenation of Terminal Alkynes
Results and Discussion
Based on
our previous work, we commenced our studies by treating
phenyl acetylene and EtOH with 2.5 mol % [Ir(cod)Cl]2 as
a catalyst, using 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) as a ligand.
Initially, we screened various reaction temperatures, and 70 °C
was found to be the best choice, furnishing the corresponding styrene
in 91% yield (Table 1, entry 6). If the temperature drops to 50 °C, only 79% yield
of styrene was obtained. Notably, the yield was significantly reduced
when the temperature increased up to 120 °C (Table 1, entry 1). These results showed
that too high or too low a temperature was unfavorable to the reaction
progress. To investigate whether other alcohols can also give better
yields, different alcohols such as isopropanol, methanol, cyclopropylmethanol,
benzyl alcohol, pinacol, and EG were tested (Table 1, entries 9–14), but the results are
not as good as EtOH. To further increase the conversion rate to styrene,
we replaced DPPE with large sterically hindering ligands or small
sterically hindering ligands (Table 1, entries 15–19). Regrettably, the expected
results were not obtained. These results showed that too large or
too small steric hindrance were not conducive to the reaction progressing.
Therefore, we performed subsequent reactions of terminal alkynes with
EtOH in the presence of [Ir(COD)Cl]2/DPPE at 70 °C
for 24 h.

With the optimized
reaction conditions in hand, a series of arylacetylenes
were investigated for extending the substrate scope (Table 2). This ligand-promoted iridium-catalyzed
transfer hydrogenation of terminal alkynes with EtOH displayed good
functional group tolerance. Arylacetylene with electron-neutral or
electron-donating groups on the aryl rings, such as alkyl, phenyl,
and methoxyl, all gave the corresponding arylethylenes in good yields.
Aryls containing an electron-withdrawing group such as fluoro, chloro,
bromo, trifluoromethyl, cyano, and nitro were also tolerated and afforded
the corresponding arylethylenes (2e–2m, 2q, 2r, 2t, 2v, and 2w) in moderate to good yields. Moreover, the reaction of
arylacetylene containing two trifluoromethyl substituents at the meta
positions of the aromatic rings also gave the corresponding arylethylene
product 2z in good yields. To our delight, N-containing
heteroaryl and naphthyl with higher steric hindrance also show good
compatibility. Notably, the retention of the F, Cl, and Br atoms in
the structures of the products should make the products considerably
useful in organic transformations. Unfortunately, amino- and amide-substituted
alkynes are not suitable for this reaction.

To explore the ability of the developed catalytic
method to deliver
alkylethylenes, a further transfer hydrogenation of alkylacetylenes
was examined. The substrate scope was surveyed to investigate the
versatility of this iridium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of alkylacetylenes,
with use of a combination of DPPE as the ligand. The alkylethylene
products were obtained in moderate to good yields for the tested substrates.
The results, which were summarized in Table 3, showed that unactivated alkylacetylenes
also gave the corresponding alkylethylenes. This shows that the method
is applicable not only to activated arylacetylenes, but also to nonactivated
alkylacetylenes. Notably, it is necessary to extend the reaction time
and increase the temperature to achieve better conversion of the substrate
because of the low activity of the nonactivated terminal alkyne.

Transfer Hydrogenation of Unactivated Terminal Alkynesa

substrate 1
(0.2 mmol), EtOH (0.4 mmol), [Ir(cod)Cl]2 (10 μmol),
DPPE (0.04 mmol), THF (1.5 mL), at 100 °C under N2 for 20 h.

The synthetic
utility of the current method was tested by performing
a gram-scale ligand-promoted iridium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation
of terminal alkynes with EtOH under the optimized conditions. Target
compound styrene 2u was obtained in 72% yield. Phenelzine
is a nonselective and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor of
the hydrazine class which is used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic,10 and it can be conveniently synthesized from
styrene (Scheme 2a).
So can it be used for anticancer drugs? Based on this assumption,
we conducted molecular docking studies of Ras homologue gene family,
member A (RhoA) and phenelzine. RhoA is a small GTPase protein in
the Rho family. Given that its overexpression is found in many malignancies,
RhoA activity has been linked within several cancer applications because
of its significant involvement in cancer signaling cascades.11 The studies were performed to help visualize
possible interactions between RhoA and phenelzine. The results showed
that phenelzine may have cation–anion electrostatic interactions
with Lys 1006. Based on this docking result, phenelzine is highly
likely to be a potent inhibitor of RhoA. The results of the docked
poses of RhoA and phenelzine are shown in Scheme 2b. To further explore phenelzine’s
role in blood vessel growth, we conducted drug effect studies of phenelzine
using zebrafish as a vertebrate model. The test results showed treatment
of zebrafish embryos with 0.01–1 μg/mL phenelzine resulted
in potent angiogenic defects (Scheme 2c). The results of this study are similar to our previous
work,12 and it will be of great significance
for promoting drug research in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
diseases. Meanwhile, we examined the activity of phenelzine in nerve
growth using zebrafish as a vertebrate model. The test results showed
treatment of zebrafish embryos with 0.01–1 μg/mL phenelzine
resulted in significant neuro suppressive effects (Scheme 2d). The results of this study
will be of great significance in research on drugs for treating epilepsy,
mania, and psychosis.

To gain a better understanding the role of ligand,
reductant, and
iridium in the transfer hydrogenation of terminal alkynes, some additional
experiments were conducted. First, control experiments showed that
the absence of EtOH, ligand, or [Ir(cod)Cl]2, shut down
the reaction (Table 1, entries 20–22), implying that each of the components was
essential to this reaction. Based on this result and our previous
work, we proposed the following catalytic cycle (Scheme 3). Ir(I) first underwent ligand
coordination with the metal center to generate an active catalytic
species A, leading to subsequent oxidative addition to
provide the Ir–H species. The coordination of alkyne to Ir–H
species followed by the insertion of the alkyne into the Ir–H
bond would lead to the formation of alkenyl iridium complex C. Subsequent β-H elimination would afford intermediate D. Then, intermediate D underwent reductive elimination
to obtain aryl ethylene while regenerating the catalytic species A.

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanisms
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed a highly efficient
ligand-promoted iridium-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of terminal
alkynes using EtOH as transfer hydrogenation agents. The new method
is compatible with multiple functional groups, especially nonactivated
alkyl ethylenes. Moreover, we performed molecular docking experiments
with phenelzine which indicated that this compound might be an inhibitor
of Rho A. The results of this study have an important reference value
for anticancer drugs such as prostate cancer and gastric cancer. The
value of our approach for practical applications was demonstrated
by studying the effects of treatment with phenelzine using zebrafish
as the vertebrate model. The results of the study show that it can
cause potent angiogenesis defects and neuro-suppressive effects. This
will be of great significance for promoting drug research in cerebrovascular
diseases, epilepsy, mania, and psychosis. Further investigation of
animal experiments, cheaper metals and transfer hydrogenation with
water are under way in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General
Information
Unless stated otherwise, all reactions
were conducted in pressure tubes under N2. All solvents
were received from commercial sources without further purification.
Commercially available reagents were used as received. Noncommercially
available substrates were synthesized following reported protocols.
Thin-layer chromatography was visualized using a combination of UV
and potassium permanganate staining techniques. Silica gel (particle
size 40–63 μm) was used for flash column chromatography.
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 400 spectrometer at 400 MHz
(1H NMR), 100 MHz (13C NMR). Proton and carbon
chemical shifts are reported relative to the solvent used as an internal
reference. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an Ion Spec
FT-ICR mass spectrometer with an ESI resource. The results of molecular
docking experiments were completed using a Molecular Operating Environment
(MOE).

Typical Procedure for Synthesis of Terminal Ethylene
To a 15 mL pressure tube were added arylacetylene 1 (0.20
mmol), [Ir(cod)Cl]2 (5 mmol, 3.6 mg), and DPPE (0.04 mmol,
15.9 mg) under N2, and then EtOH (0.4 mmol, 23 mL) and
tetrahydrofuran (THF) (1.5 mL) were added. The resulting solution
was stirred at 70 or 100 °C for 24 h. After the reaction was
completed, the solution was cooled to room temperature, and diluted
with ethyl acetate (10 mL). The combined organic phases were washed
with brine, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate.
The organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified
by column chromatography (n-hexane or n-hex/EtOAc = 100:1) to afford the desired product.

Gram-Scale
Synthesis
According to the typical procedure:
to a 250 mL pressure tube were added 4-ethynylbiphenyl (5.61 mmol,
1.0 g), [Ir(cod)Cl]2 (140 mmol, 94 mg), DPPE (1.12 mmol,
446 mg) under N2, and then EtOH (11.2 mmol, 1.14 mL), and
THF (35 mL) were added. The resulting solution was stirred at 70 °C
for 24 h. After column purification (n-hexane), 4-phenylstyrene
was obtained (728 mg, 72% yield).

Zebrafish Experiments
At 6 hpf, embryos were screened
under an anatomical microscope to remove the morphologically abnormal
individuals. Around 10 healthy embryos were loaded into each well
of 96-well plate in E3 solution. At the setting time, E3 solutions
were replaced with different phenelzine treatment solutions. The control
and treated groups were analyzed at different intervals. At 55 hpf,
the Tg(fli1a:nEGFP) zebrafish embryos were collected for imaging.
At 55 hpf, for confocal imaging embryos were anesthetized with E3/0.16
mg/mL tricaine/1% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (Sigma) and embedded in 0.8%
low-melt agarose. Confocal imaging was performed with a Leica TCS-SP8
LSM. Analysis was performed using Imaris software.
