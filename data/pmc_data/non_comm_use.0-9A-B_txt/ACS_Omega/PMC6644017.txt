Two
structural isomers of (9H-pyreno[4,5-d]imidazol-10-yl)-benzaldehyde, with para and meta substitution
patterns, were synthesized by condensation of 4,5-pyrenedione with
terephthalaldehyde and isophthalaldehyde, respectively. These new
pyrenoimidazole derivatives were characterized by single-crystal X-ray
crystallography, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence
spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry to elucidate their structural,
solid-state packing, and electronic properties. Interactions of these
compounds with fluoride anions in polar organic solvents (acetone
and dimethyl sulfoxide) were investigated by NMR, UV–vis, and
fluorescence techniques in conjunction with density functional theory
calculations. UV–vis analysis showed that the binding of the
two pyrenoimidazolyl benzaldehydes with fluoride anions resulted in
significant colorimetric responses, while fluorescence studies showed
that the para-pyrenoimidazolyl benzaldehyde behaved
as an intramolecular charge transfer fluorescent probe, exhibiting
ratiometric sensing performance to efficiently detect and quantify
fluoride anions at the sub-millimolar level.

Introduction
The design and synthesis
of functional organic π-conjugated
molecules are of considerable importance to the field of nanoscale
electronics and optoelectronics1−6 as research in this area continuously adds new molecular building
blocks to the synthetic toolbox and accelerates the development of
materials and devices with improved performance or unprecedented function.
Pyrene is a small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar, rigid
π-conjugated molecular backbone and hence exhibits fascinating
photophysical, electrochemical, and supramolecular properties.7 For decades, pyrene has been widely used as an
active fluorophore in materials science. Currently, the number of
pyrene-based molecules is growing rapidly owing to the great efforts
made by synthetic chemists.7−9

9H-Pyreno[4,5-d]imidazole (PI)
is a heterocycle-fused pyrene system that can be readily prepared
by the condensation reaction between 4,5-pyrenedione and a suitable
aldehyde in the presence of ammonium acetate.10,11 The extended π-framework and the ability of imidazole to form
complexes with various metal ions and acids have rendered PI an active
component in the preparation of functional molecules, ranging from
ligands for metal ions,12 fluorescence
emitters,13−17 dye-sensitized solar cells,18−20 and electrocatalysts.11 The imidazole unit in the PI system is important
because it provides effective binding sites for the capture of anions
and/or metal cations.21−24 In particular, hydrogen bonding can occur between the imidazolyl
N–H proton and various anions. Indeed, a number of PI-based
sensors have relied upon these interactions. For example, Baitalik
and co-workers prepared Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes containing a PI
ligand and demonstrated their colorimetric and fluorescence sensing
function toward a range of anions.25,26 Fluorescence
quenching was observed when these complexes were mixed with some basic
anions, such as F–, CN–, and CH3COO–, due to deprotonation of the imidazolyl
moiety. Acidic anions (e.g., H2PO4–), on the other hand, interacted with the pyrenoimidazolyl unit through
hydrogen bonding to induce fluorescence enhancement. In 2015, a pyrene-bisimidazole
system was reported by the Baitalik group and it showed significant
absorption and emission responses to CN– and Cu2+ ions.27 Such properties allowed
this compound to act as a ratiometric optical sensor for CN– in aqueous media and a molecular memory device. Most recently, Karthik
et al. reported the synthesis of a series of substituted 10-aryl-PIs
and investigated their photophysical properties and reactivity toward
Ru(II)-catalyzed oxidative annulation.16

Synthetically, aryl-PIs (particularly the phenyl-PIs) can
be easily
and economically prepared owing to the abundant availability of benzaldehyde
precursors from commercial sources. They should therefore constitute
a versatile platform for the development of novel chromophores/fluorophores
with diverse functionalities and activities. In the literature, however,
the family of phenyl-PIs is still underdeveloped and there is a lack
of demonstration of their applicability in molecule-based optoelectronic
devices, such as colorimetric and fluorescence chemosensors. Awareness
of this background thus motivated us to design and characterize a
new class of 10-phenyl-PIs in which the phenyl group is functionalized
with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). Generally speaking, the
imidazolyl group is electron-accepting in nature and can provide an
acidic N–H proton to interact with various anions through hydrogen
bonds.28−33 The hydrogen bonding interaction, in theory, polarizes the imidazolyl
N–H bond to alter the electron density on the imidazolyl ring.
In a phenyl-PI system such as that illustrated in Figure 1, intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) can conceivably occur through π-electron delocalization.34,35 Such an effect might be expected to significantly modulate the electronic
and photophysical properties, particularly the fluorescence behavior.
So far, there has been no report of PI-based chemosensors that operate
with an ICT mechanism. In the design of chemosensors, the ICT mechanism
has often been used to achieve ratiometric fluorescence sensors, which
detect analytes (e.g., anions) at two or more significant emission
wavelengths. For practical application, ratiometric fluorescence measurements
are advantageous over the detection methods that rely on only single
wavelength emission in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and detection
range.36−41 In this work, we have investigated the fundamental properties of
benzaldehyde-substituted PI systems in terms of their structural,
crystallographic, and electronic properties. Furthermore, the interactions
of these new PI systems with fluoride anion were examined to demonstrate
the possibility of tuning this type of fluorophores to give ratiometric
fluorescence sensing function for fluoride anions.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Pyrenoimidazolyl-Benzaldehyde
Isomers 4 and 5
In this work, two
pyrenoimidazolyl-benzaldehyde
(PI-BAL) derivatives (4 and 5 in Scheme 1) were designed and
synthesized. In the structures of the two compounds, an electron-withdrawing
formyl group is attached to the phenyl group at the para and meta
positions, respectively. The two structural isomers were expected
to help understand their photophysical properties in relation to substitution
patterns, particularly the effects of resonance (para) versus induction
(meta). The synthesis of compounds 4 and 5 was conducted through a direct condensation reaction between the
now readily available 4,5-pyrenedione (1)42 and terephthalaldehyde (2) or isophthalaldehyde
(3), in the presence of ammonium acetate and glacial
acetic acid. In the reactions, the molar ratio of 4,5-pyrenedione
(1) versus 2 or 3 was set as
1:3, so that only one of the formyl groups in 2 or 3 underwent condensation and the other remained intact. The
condensation reactions proceeded smoothly upon heating at 110 °C
for 1–3 h. Compounds 4 and 5 were
obtained in reasonably good yields (50–60%) after silica flash
column chromatographic separation.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of PI-BALs 4 and 5
Solid-State Structural Properties
The obtained PI-BALs 4 and 5 were characterized initially by infrared
(IR), mass spectrometry (MS), 1H and 13C NMR
analyses. Detailed spectroscopic data are included in the Supporting Information. Recrystallization of
compound 4 from acetone/hexanes (3:7, v/v) resulted in
the formation of crystals in different forms; fast recrystallization
afforded thin orange needles, whereas slow crystallization yielded
larger translucent single crystals with a brownish color. A crystal
of 4 was subjected to single-crystal X-ray crystallographic
analysis to determine its solid-state structure.

In the crystal
structure of 4, the phenyl ring does not assume the expected
co-planar orientation relative to the PI moiety, even though co-planarity
is favored by maximal π-conjugation. Instead, the phenyl group
is rotated by 21.6° with respect to the PI group. The slightly
twisted conformation can be ascribed to crystal packing forces, as
density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the minimum-energy
structure of compound 4 in the gas phase or solvents
is fully planar when intermolecular interactions are not taken into
consideration (vide infra). One interesting feature observed in the
solid-state packing of compound 4 is that hydrogen-bonded
dimers are formed through the interactions of the imidazolyl N–H
protons (donor) and the C=O oxygens (acceptor) with an intermolecular
O···H distance of 2.27 Å and an N–H···O
angle at 169.5° as shown in Figure 2A. In the solid state, the hydrogen-bonded
dimers are closely packed together through π-stacking as revealed
by Figure 2B, and such
a tight packing motif leaves no space for solvent molecules to co-crystalize.
Overall, intermolecular hydrogen bonding and π-stacking are
the two major factors dictating the solid-state structure of compound 4.

the hydrogen-bonded dimer of PI-BAL 4 (CCDC 1851836).

plot (50% probability) of PI-BAL 5 co-crystallized with

of 5.

PI-BAL 5 was recrystallized from a mixed solvent of
hexanes/DMSO (9:1, v/v) to give dark-brown single crystals. X-ray
structural analysis showed that, in contrast to 4, the
molecule of 5 adopts a fully planar conformation when
packed in the solid state (see Figure 2C). Also of note is that two molecules of DMSO are
present with compound 5 in the unit cell, whereby multiple
hydrogen bonds among them can be identified. In particular, the imidazolyl
N–H proton forms a significant hydrogen bond with the oxygen
atom of one DMSO molecule at an O···H distance of 2.12
Å, while another DMSO molecule interacts with the first DMSO
molecule through S–O and CH3 interactions (Figure 2C). The crystal structure
of 5 also reveals that the phenyl and pyrenyl protons,
which are in close proximity to the imidazolyl N–H group, form
hydrogen bonds with the first DMSO molecule. The participation of
DMSO molecules in the crystallization of 5 thus leads
to a solid-state packing motif dramatically different than that of
its para-isomer 4. As shown in Figure 2D, π-stacking occurs but there are
no hydrogen bonding interactions among the molecules of 5. The association of DMSO molecules with 5 through hydrogen
bonds makes the crystal packing less tight than the case of 4.

Solvent Effects on UV–Vis Absorption
and Fluorescence
Properties
The UV–vis absorption and fluorescence
emission properties of PI-BALs 4 and 5 were
studied in a range of organic solvents to assess the solvent effects. Figure 3 illustrates the
UV–vis and fluorescence spectra measured in three organic solvents
(toluene, DMSO, and methanol), which are highlighted here to represent
nonpolar, dipolar aprotic, and dipolar protic solvents, respectively.
For compound 4, the UV–vis absorption spectrum
features two long-wavelength bands at 394 and 410 nm in toluene (Figure 3A). A similar pattern
can be seen in the spectrum measured in benzene. When the solvents
are switched to methylene chloride and chloroform, which are also
nonpolar in nature, only one absorption band appears in this spectral
region (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information for details). In view of the hydrogen-bonded dimer observed in the
crystal structure of 4, the spectral variations are rationalized
as follows: in aromatic solvents (benzene and toluene), compound 4 forms a hydrogen-bonded dimer, in which the hydrogen bonds
polarize the imidazolyl N–H and the C=O groups to enhance
the “push-and-pull” effect, resulting in the π
→ π* transition bands being bathochromically shifted.
UV–vis analysis of 4 in toluene at various concentrations
(ca. 10–5 to 10–3 M) shows that
the relative intensity of the peak at 410 nm decreases with decreasing
concentration of 4 (see Figure S11A in the Supporting Information). When the toluene solution
of 4 was titrated with methanol, the two long-wavelength
bands gradually merged into one absorption peak (Figure S11B in the Supporting Information). On the basis of these
experimental observations, the peak at 394 nm in toluene is attributed
to the free molecule of 4, while the peak at 410 nm is
assigned to the hydrogen-bonded dimer of 4.

Figure 3 (A) Normalized
UV–vis absorption and (B) fluorescence emission
spectra of 4 measured in various solvents. (C) Normalized
UV–vis absorption and (D) fluorescence emission spectra of 5 measured in various solvents.

In polar solvents, the long-wavelength absorption band of 4 shows only a small degree of bathochromic shift relative
to those measured in nonpolar solvents. This trend generally agrees
with the DFT computational analysis, which shows that in the solution
phase compound 4 becomes more delocalized when the solvent
polarity increases. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations reveal
that the lowest-energy absorption band of 4 is mainly
due to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) → lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition, and it does not vary
very significantly in different solvents (see Table S4 in the Supporting Information), which is in agreement
with the experimentally observed weak solvent effects in the UV–vis
analysis. Similarly, the absorption profiles of 5 show
only slight variations when changing the solvent polarity from nonpolar
to polar (Figure 3C).
However, in methanol the UV–vis absorption bands show notable
hypsochromic shift relative to the others. It can be rationalized
that in a dipolar protic solvent such as methanol the imidazolyl C=N
group, which is a hydrogen bond acceptor, can form hydrogen bond(s)
with the solvent molecule(s). Such interactions would be expected
to cause the hypsochromic shift of UV–vis peaks in methanol.
Overall, the UV–vis absorption analysis indicates that the
π → π* transitions in both compounds 4 and 5 are more significantly influenced by the protic
nature of solvent than solvent polarity.

The fluorescence spectra
of 4 and 5 exhibit
a high degree of dependence on both solvent polarity and hydrogen
bonding interactions. As can be seen in Figure 3B, the maximum emission wavelength of 4 in toluene appears at 464 nm and it is bathochromically
shifted to 529 nm in DMSO, which is a hydrogen bond acceptor. In methanol,
which acts as both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, the emission
of 4 is almost completely quenched. For compound 5, the maximum emission wavelength is shifted from 445 nm
(in toluene) to 542 nm (in DMSO), but in methanol it is blue-shifted
to 403 nm (see Figure 3D). The drastic solvent effects observed in the fluorescence spectra
of 4 and 5 suggest that the excited states
of these compounds undergo diverse radiative and nonradiative deactivation
pathways which are sensitive to solvent–solute interactions;
especially, the mechanism of imidazole-based excited-state proton
transfer43−46 could play an important role in the photo-excitation/deactivation
processes.

Electrochemical Redox Properties
The electrochemical
redox activities of PI-BALs 4 and 5 were
examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Scanned in the positive potential
window, there were no significant redox peaks detected for the two
compounds, indicating that they cannot be oxidized easily. In the
negative potential window, compounds 4 and 5 exhibit very similar redox features in their CV profiles (Figure 4). In acetone, two
redox couples were detected in the cyclic voltammograms of both compounds,
while in DMSO the two compounds were found to undergo three distinctive
redox processes in the negative potential window. The three steps
of electron transfers are tentatively assigned to the injection of
electrons to the benzaldehyde, imidazolyl, and pyrenyl groups respectively.
The positions of the formyl group (para and meta) appear to have the
same impact on the overall electrochemical redox properties of the
PI-BAL system.

Interactions with the Fluoride
Anion
As mentioned previously,
the acidic imidazolyl N–H group in the PI system can participate
in hydrogen bonding interactions with various hydrogen bond acceptors
(e.g., anions).28−33 The binding in theory would modulate the electronic properties of
the PI system, leading to significant changes in electronic absorption
and emission behavior. In a sense, this could serve as the mechanism
for efficient colorimetric and fluorescence sensing of certain anions.
To investigate these properties, PI-BALs 4 and 5 were subjected to titration with tetrabutylammonium fluoride
(TBAF) as a fluoride anion source in acetone and/or DMSO, and the
titration processes were monitored by 1H NMR, UV–vis
absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the
results of 1H NMR titration of compound 4 with
TBAF in acetone-d6. Before titration,
the eight pyrenyl protons of 4 appear as discrete signals
without degeneracy in the 1H NMR spectrum, suggesting that
the imidazolyl proton (N–H) does not undergo very rapid exchange
processes (e.g., tautomerization) in acetone. Upon addition of TBAF
at ca. 0.2 molar equivalent, the 1H NMR spectral pattern
changes immediately to feature twofold symmetry and degeneracy for
the pyrenyl protons; for instance, the pyrenyl protons at the 4,5-positions
(labeled as g and g′ in Figure 5) can be now seen
as a singlet in the spectra. Such an observation suggests that the
interactions of fluoride anion with 4 considerably accelerate
the tautomerization of the imidazolyl moiety, rendering the PI unit
twofold symmetric in the 1H NMR spectrum. DFT calculations
show that fluoride anion can form a hydrogen bond with the imidazolyl
N–H group (vide infra), which weakens the N–H bond and
facilitates more rapid tautomerization. It is also noted that the
N–H signal at 13.04 ppm disappears after ca. 0.1 molar equivalent
of TBAF is added, due to rapid proton exchange processes, most likely
tautomerization. As the titration continues, the aldehyde proton (labeled
as a in Figure 5) shows a notable upfield shift, from 10.14 to 9.97 ppm, and
the titration reaches an equilibrium after the addition of more than
2 molar equivalents of TBAF. The results suggest that PI-BAL 4 interacts with fluoride anions through two steps as outlined
in Figure 5. In the
first step, a 1:1 complex is formed through hydrogen bonding interactions,
while in the second step compound 4 is deprotonated along
with the formation of [HF2–] ion.37 During each of the two steps, the imidazolyl
group experiences increased electron density which can be delocalized
to the para-formyl group through the resonance effect, causing the
aldehyde proton to significantly shift toward upfield. Some of the
aryl protons of 4 also show significant upfield or downfield
shifts during the titration, and these shifts can be reasonably correlated
with the fluoride anion binding and subsequent deprotonation of the
imidazolyl N–H group of 4.

Figure 5 1H NMR (300
MHz) spectra monitoring the titration of
PI-BAL 4 with TBAF in acetone-d6.

The electronic absorption and
emission properties of compound 4 in response to the
interactions with fluoride anions were
examined by UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic
analyses. Figure 6A
shows the UV–vis titration results of 4 with TBAF
in acetone. Upon addition of TBAF from 0 to ca. 3 molar equivalents,
the long-wavelength absorption region (ca. 400–520 nm) shows
a steady increase in intensity and the absorption band at 355 nm decreases
significantly. Two isosbestic points at 382 and 399 nm are clearly
observable, and this stage of spectral changes can be attributed to
the formation of a 1:1 complex between 4 and fluoride
anion through hydrogen bonding interactions. After titration with
more than 3 molar equivalents of TBAF, the UV–vis spectra exhibit
another stage of changes in which a long-wavelength absorption band
at 448 nm grows prominently, while the short-wavelength absorption
bands in the region of 350 nm to 400 nm continuously decrease. TD-DFT
calculations suggest that the strongly increasing new band is consistent
with the HOMO → LUMO transition of deprotonated 4. Accordingly, the second stage of spectral changes is linked to
the deprotonation of compound 4, through which an anionic
product [4–] is formed. This species
is stabilized by the resonance effect exerted by the electron-withdrawing
formyl group at the para position of the phenyl ring.

Figure 6 Titration of PI-BAL 4 with TBAF monitored by UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy in (A) acetone and (B) DMSO, fluorescence
spectroscopy in (C) acetone and (D) DMSO.

In DMSO, the UV–vis absorption of 4 responds
to TBAF titration in a different way than in acetone. As shown in Figure 6B, there is only
one stage of spectral changes observed during the whole process of
titration, with three isosbestic points clearly observable at 409,
330, and 311 nm. Compared to the titration results obtained in acetone,
the different spectral responses observed in DMSO suggest that in
DMSO the second step (i.e., deprotonation) occurs more readily than
the first hydrogen bond forming step.

Subsequent to the UV–vis
titration experiments, the fluorescence
spectral changes of compound 4 upon titration with TBAF
in acetone or DMSO were determined. In acetone, the maximum emission
peak of 4 shows a dramatic redshift from 506 to 557 nm
during the titration of up to more than 30 molar equivalents of TBAF,
with the intensity of emission peak attenuated by approximately 50%
(see Figure 6C). In
DMSO, similar fluorescence spectral changes can be observed (6D). As discussed above, the interactions of 4 with fluoride anions result in deprotonation of the imidazolyl
N–H group to form a delocalized anion. The resonance effect
between the imidazolyl anion and the electron-withdrawing formyl group
at the para positions should facilitate access to an emissive CT state
during the photo-excitation processes, leading to the bathochromic
shift of its emission band. In this way, compound 4 behaves
as an ICT fluorophore and could therefore function as an effective
ratiometric fluorescence probe for the detection and quantification
of fluoride anion in solution. To evaluate such sensory function,
correlations of the ratio of fluorescence intensities at two different
wavelengths with the concentration of TBAF were made. Herein, the
two fluorescence intensities were determined at the maximum emission
wavelengths before the addition of TBAF and after the saturation of
titration was reached. As can be seen from Figure 7A, in acetone the ratio of fluorescence intensities
at 507 and 561 nm versus the concentration of TBAF shows two linear
relationships. In the sub-millimolar range, the correlation features
satisfactory sensitivity for quantification of fluoride anion. In
DMSO (Figure 7B), the
correlations appear to be more complex, with three linear relationships
identified. The linearity in the low-concentration range (<0.3
mM) shows the best sensitivity in terms of sensor performance, but
the detection range is a bit narrower than that in acetone.

ratio of fluorescence intensities of PI-BAL 4 at two
different wavelengths against the concentration of
TBAF. (A) Fluorescence intensities at 507 and 561 nm (F507/F561) in acetone, (B)
fluorescence intensities at 530 and 585 nm (F530/F585) in DMSO. Solid lines
are the linear least squares fitting for data points in selected ranges
and associated R2 values are indicated.

The interactions of compound 5 with TBAF in the solution
phase were also studied. Figure 8 shows the 1H NMR titration spectra obtained
in acetone-d6. During the titration, the
aldehyde proton shows an upfield shift from 10.21 to 10.14 ppm. The
magnitude of this shift (0.07 ppm) is significantly smaller than that
observed in the titration of 4 with TBAF (0.17 ppm).
This can be explained by the meta relationship between the formyl
group and the PI unit, which precludes a direct resonance interaction
between the negatively charged N atom and the formyl group. It is
also interesting to note that the chemical shifts of the other aryl
proton signals all change only slightly during the addition of the
first equivalent of TBAF. This observation suggests that the formation
of a 1:1 complex between 5 and fluoride anions does not
polarize the imidazolyl N–H bond as much as in the case of 4. In principle, the imidazolyl N–H of 5 is less acidic than that of 4 due to the lack of a
direct resonance interaction with the formyl group. As such, 5 is predicted to form a weaker hydrogen bond with the fluoride
ion than its para-isomer 4. This point is corroborated
by DFT computational analysis (vide infra).

MHz) spectra monitoring the titration of
PI-BAL 5 with TBAF in acetone-d6.

The results of the UVvis titration
of PI-BAL 5 with
TBAF in acetone and DMSO are shown in Figure 9A,B. As in the case of its para-isomer 4, the UV–vis absorption of 5 shows a
two-stage response to the fluoride anion in acetone. Upon titration
from 0 to ca. 3.9 molar equivalents of TBAF, the spectra show an increase
in absorption intensity in the long-wavelength region (390–480
nm) and a slight decrease in intensity in the short-wavelength region.
There are three isosbestic points observed at 386, 382, and 368 nm
in the first stage of spectral change. In the second stage, a long-wavelength
band at 409 nm grows pronouncedly and it can be assigned to the π
→ π* transition of the deprotonated 5 upon
interactions with the second equivalent of the fluoride anion. In
DMSO, the UV–vis absorption spectra only exhibit one-stage
responses to the titration with TBAF, with five isosbestic points
observed at 388, 384, 375, 337, and 307 nm. In contrast to the fluorescence
titration results of 4, meta-pyrenoimidazolyl
benzaldehyde 5 responds to the fluoride ion in acetone
and DMSO with only fluorescence attenuation (see Figure 9C,D). Comparing the different
fluorescence behavior of the two structural isomers, 4 and 5, in response to fluoride anion titration, it
is evident that the resonance effect plays a crucial and indispensable
role in inducing ICT emission for the PI system. It is also worth
noting that the fluorescence responses of 4 to other
halide anions (Cl–, Br–, and I–) were observed to be insignificant particularly in
DMSO (see Figures 10, S23 and S24 in the Supporting Information). These results demonstrate that compound 4 can indeed
serve as a selective fluorescence probe to detect fluoride among other
halide anions. Further understanding of the detailed structure–photophysical
property relationship as well as the effect of solvent will be of
great value for the rational design and tuning of highly efficient
and sensitive fluorescence sensors based on the PI fluorophore.

Theoretical Modeling Studies
DFT computational analysis
was carried out on PI-BALs 4 and 5 to gain
deeper insight into their structural and electronic properties. Figure 11 illustrates the
optimized ground-state structures of compounds 4 and 5 in the gas phase, with their frontier molecular orbitals
(FMOs) displayed as well. It can be seen that the major differences
between the structural isomers lie in their unoccupied (antibonding)
orbitals (e.g., LUMO and LUMO + 1), while the occupied (bonding) orbitals
(HOMO and HOMO – 1) of the two compounds appear to be very
similar in shape and spatial distribution. Owing to the resonance
effect, the LUMO of para-isomer 4 is more delocalized
than that of meta-isomer 5. For the LUMO + 1 of meta-isomer 5, however, the orbital exhibits more extended spatial distribution
than that of para-isomer 4. Also of note is that para-isomer 4 has a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap (3.04 eV) than meta-isomer 5 (3.23 eV) because of the resonance effect. The different
FMO energies and distributions thus account for their different electronic
transition properties in the ground and excited states.

(isovalue = 0.02 e/Å3) and eigenvalues
of FMOs for PI-BALs 4 and 5 calculated at
the B3LYP/6–31++G(d,p) level of theory in the gas phase.

To better understand the interactions
(particularly, hydrogen bonding)
between PI-BALs and the fluoride anion, the 1:1 complexes of [4···F–] and [5···F–] were modeled by DFT calculations.
Herein, the computational studies took both the gas and solution phases
into consideration, with three representative solvents (benzene, acetone,
and DMSO). As shown in Figure 12A, the fluoride anion binds with compound 4 through three hydrogen bonding interactions in the gas phase. The
primary binding force comes from the imidazolyl N–H1···F– interaction, while the pyrenyl
proton H1 and phenyl proton H3 also contribute
hydrogen bonds to bind with the fluoride anion in a way similar to
the [DMSO···5] interactions observed in
the crystal structure of 5 (Figure 2C). In the gas phase, H1···F– shows a bond distance at 1.04 Å and N–H1 distance at 1.42 Å, indicating a significant degree
of deprotonation at the imidazolyl N–H position upon binding
with fluoride ion. The nature of the bonding interactions between 4 and F– was also assessed by quantum theory
of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis.47 Through the analysis, three bond critical points (BCPs) were identified
between F– anion and each of the three protons labeled
as H1, H2, and H3 in Figure 12. The imidazolyl H1···F– interaction shows a weak covalent
bond character, with ρ(BCP) = 0.240 au and ∇2ρ(BCP) = −0.879. The two BCPs between F– and pyrenyl H2/phenyl H3 show similar ρ(BCP)
values (ca. 0.011–0.013 au), which are in the range of 0.002–0.040
au for a hydrogen bond.48,49 In the solution phase,
however, the H1···F– bond
elongates and the imidazolyl N–H1 bond shortens
with increasing solvent polarity, suggesting that the degree of N–H
deprotonation is attenuated in polar organic media. QTAIM analysis
also reveals that the H1···F– interaction is weakened to exhibit a hydrogen bond character in
polar organic solvents (see Table S10 in the Supporting Information for details).

(B) [5···F–] in the
gas phase at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level
of theory, and variation of hydrogen bond distances in different solvents
calculated by the polarizable continuum model (PCM) solvent model.

For the optimized structures of
[5···F–] in the gas
phase and various solvents (see Figure 12B), the N–H1 and H1···F– bonds
are shorter than those of [4···F–]. These results suggest that the N–H1···F– interaction in [5···F–] is relatively weak. Again, this can be attributed
to the meta relationship between the formyl group and the imidalzolyl
unit in 5, which rules out a direct resonance interaction
between them. To quantitatively assess the thermodynamic properties
of the fluoride anion interactions with 4 and 5, the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG°)
for the 1:1 complexation reactions between the fluoride anion with 4 and 5 and subsequent deprotonation reactions
in the gas phase and various solvents were computed. Scheme 2 lists the detailed thermodynamic
data, which show that the two steps of fluoride interactions are both
exergonic and increasing the solvent polarity reduces the thermodynamic
driving force significantly.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized and studied the structural and
electronic properties of two structural isomers of PI-BALs. Hydrogen
bonding interactions have been found to play an important role in
the solid-state structures of these compounds. Of particular note
is that para-isomer 4 tends to form hydrogen-bonded dimers
while meta-isomer can cocrystalize with hydrogen bond acceptors, such
as DMSO. Significant solvents effects were observed in the UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence emission properties of compounds 4 and 5. Cyclic voltammetric studies show that
both compounds 4 and 5 have similar redox
activities in polar solvents (acetone and DMSO). In the presence of
fluoride anions, the two compounds undergo similar two-step reactions
in polar solvents: (i) forming a hydrogen-bonded 1:1 complex and (ii)
deprotonation of the imidazolyl N–H group. The UV–vis
absorption spectra of the two compounds in response to fluoride anion
titration are similar, showing colorimetric responses as a result
of fluoride-induced deprotonation of the PI chromophore. The fluorescence
responses of 4 and 5 to fluoride anion titration,
however, are dramatically different. For para-isomer 4, the fluorescence is retained to some extent but the maximum emission
band is bathochromically shifted. Such properties enable compound 4 to act as a fluorescence ratiometric sensor for detection
of fluoride anion in solution. The interactions of fluoride anions
with meta-isomer 5, on the other hand, result in fluorescence
attenuation. Comparison of the fluorescence properties of the two
pyrenoimidazolyl benzaldehyde isomers underscores the key role of
the resonance effect in inducing the ICT mechanism. Our current studies
lay a fundamental foundation for further efforts to design and develop
new functional ICT fluorophores based on the PI motif.

Experimental
Section
Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial
sources and
used without purification unless otherwise noted. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 MHz ADVANCE III
spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alfa spectrometer.
High-resolution APPI–TOF MS analyses were performed on a GCT
premier Micromass Technologies instrument. UV–visible absorption
spectra were recorded using a Cary 6000i spectrophotometer. Fluorescence
spectra were measured on a Photon Technology International (PTI) QuantaMaster
spectrofluorometer. CV analyses were performed on a standard three-electrode
setup (glassy carbon working electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode,
and Pt wire counter electrode) controlled by a BASi Epsilon potentiostat.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted on a Bruker
D8/APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα (1.54178
Å) microfocus source. Crystal structures were solved and refined
with the SHELXT software package. DFT and TD-DFT computational studies
were carried out using the hybrid B3LYP functional50,51 with the 6-31++G(d,p) basis set as implemented in the Gaussian 09
software package.52 Optimized ground-state
geometries were confirmed by frequency calculations to show the presence
of no imaginary frequencies. Solvent effects were calculated using
the PCM53 implemented in Gaussian 09. Visualization
of molecular structures and orbitals were done using CYLview54 and GaussView 5.55 QTAIM analysis was carried out using the Multiwfn program.56
