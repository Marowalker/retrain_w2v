We present a detailed atomic-level
study of defects in bilayer
MoS2 using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy
at an 80 kV accelerating voltage. Sulfur vacancies are found in both
the top and bottom layers in 2H- and 3R-stacked MoS2 bilayers.
In 3R-stacked bilayers, sulfur vacancies can migrate between layers
but more preferably reside in the (Mo–2S) column rather than
the (2S) column, indicating more complex vacancy production and migration
in the bilayer system. As the point vacancy number increases, aggregation
into larger defect structures occurs, and this impacts the interlayer
stacking. Competition between compression in one layer from the loss
of S atoms and the van der Waals interlayer force causes much less
structural deformations than those in the monolayer system. Sulfur
vacancy lines neighboring in top and bottom layers introduce less
strain compared to those staggered in the same layer. These results
show how defect structures in multilayered two-dimensional materials
differ from their monolayer form.

Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs), such as MoS2 and WS2, are direct band
gap semiconductors in their
monolayer form and indirect band gap semiconductors in bulk.1−4 They offer band gaps in the red visible spectrum and semiconducting
properties that expand the application of two-dimensional (2D) materials
beyond what graphene alone can achieve.5−7 The presence of defects
in TMDs influences the photoluminescence spectra, electron transport
behavior, and photosensing capabilities.8−12 Understanding the structure of the defects is important
for developing an accurate picture of their impact on properties.
Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) is
one of the leading approaches to study the atomic structure of defects
in 2D materials.13

With the availability
of monolayer TMDs, detailed atomic-level
studies of vacancies in MoS2 and other S- and Se-based
TMDs have been performed.14−24 However, no detailed studies on the structure and dynamics of defects
in bilayer TMDs have been reported. MoS2 or WS2 bilayers have two natural stacking forms: 3R and 2H stacking, with
2H dominating due to energetic preference.25,26 Most recent work has been focused on the 2H stacking structure and
related optical properties27 and some has
been performed on 3R-stacked MoS2 due to its relative rarity.28

Upon 80 kV electron beam irradiation
of MoS2 and WS2, S vacancies are created and
also mobilized, resulting in point defects that combine to form line
defects.14,29−32 The line defects in MoS2 can extend in length and also in width. As the length of a one sulfur
vacancy line (1SVL) defect increases, large lattice compression occurs
to accommodate the loss of S atoms and change in charge density around
the Mo atoms. This also causes large out-of-plane distortion to the
monolayer sheet, similar to the buckling in graphene monolayers caused
by dislocations.33 The ability of monolayer
sheets to buckle when defects are introduced plays an important role
in strain relief.34 Recent work has shown
that heating graphene to high temperatures causes the substrate it
is attached to expand and produce tension on graphene.35 This in turn causes partial dislocations to
occur because single dislocation cores are only stable when accompanied
by out-of-plane buckling. The ability of a 2D material to accommodate
buckling and defects is expected to be different as more layers are
added, due to the interlayer van der Waals forces. Unique interlayer
interactions have been previously seen in bilayer graphene, with very
small mismatch angles between the layers, causing local regions of
commensurate and incommensurate stacking.36 Recent work has shown that as the width of line vacancies in MoS2 increases, the rows of S vacancy lines are staggered from
top to bottom to enable stable bond restructuring.12 The reconstructed bonds have different unit cell structures,
and this will cause changes in the local van der Waals interactions
with the second layer in bilayer 2D systems. Furthermore, the compression
associated with the multiple stacked line vacancies in MoS2 will cause local shifts in atomic positions extending out from the
defect region, and this will give rise to competition between in-plane
compression around defects and interlayer van der Waals forces and
associated 2H and 3R stacking phases.

In this study, MoS2 samples are grown on Si substrates
with a 300 nm oxide layer using methods based on our prior work.12 Samples of MoS2 are predominantly
monolayers, but sometimes, small bilayer domains are found. We study
the structure and dynamics of defects in bilayer MoS2,
from point defects to aggregated clusters. Both 2H- and 3R-stacked
bilayers are examined due to their presence in chemical vapor deposition
(CVD)-grown samples. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
are used to provide accurate model structures for multislice image
simulations to compare to the experimental phase contrast AC-TEM images.

Results
and Discussion
For our as-grown monolayer and few-layer MoS2 (as indicated
in Figure S1), the interface of the monolayer
and 2H-stacked bilayer MoS2 are shown in Figure S2a,b. First, we examine the presence of S vacancies
in the 2H-stacked bilayer MoS2 (Figure 1). Electron beam irradiation at 80 kV is
known to introduce sulfur vacancies in MoS2.13Figure 1a shows a typical AC-TEM image of a 2H-stacked bilayer, with
visible weaker contrast spots marked by white and red arrows. The
magnified images in Figure 1b,c show two different levels of reduced contrast associated
with single S vacancies (SVs) and double S vacancies (DVs) in the
same column. Atomic models of 1SV (gray) and 1DV (red) from DFT calculations
are respectively shown in Figure 1d,e in both top (colored ball) and three-dimensional
(3D) views (colored cross). Corresponding multislice image simulations
(Figure 1f,g) and line
profile analysis (Figure 1h,i) show good similarity with the experimental results, confirming
SVs and DVs in 2H-stacked bilayer MoS2.

Under prolonged electron
beam irradiation, SVs and DVs in 2H bilayer
MoS2 increase in density and start to aggregate into extended
line defects, as shown in Figure 2a. The line defects in 2H bilayer MoS2 can
exist in variable lengths along the zigzag directions and also gain
width along the armchair direction (Figure 2b–e). The magnified AC-TEM image in Figure 2b shows a 1SVL, with
a length of 7SVs. The corresponding
DFT-calculated model, in top and 3D views (Figure 2f), shows negligible in-plane or out-of-plane
lattice distortions, triggered by losing seven S atoms in the bottom
layer, which differs from the findings of prior studies on 1SVLs in
monolayer MoS2.13 Two types
of 2SVLs are observed (Figure 2c,d), with different S reconstructions. Two corresponding
DFT-calculated models are evaluated (Figure 2g,h). Type A has 2SVLs within only one MoS2 layer, with alternate staggering across top and bottom S
sites. On the basis of a previous report,12 the staggering configuration of two vacancy lines in the bottom
layer is energetically preferred. Type B has one 1SVL in the bottom and the other in
the top MoS2 layer, giving a 2SVL defect overall, spread
across the two layers. The vacancy lines can exist in either plane
of each layer. DFT calculations indicate that no obvious out-of-plane
distortion occurs in either type A or B 2SVLs in the 2H bilayer, which
is different from that in the 2SVL in monolayer MoS2. The
observation of type B 2SVL also indicates the coexistence of S vacancies
in both the bottom and top layers in the 2H-stacked MoS2 bilayer. In Figure 2e, a 3SVL is presented, showing a similar structure to that of A-2SVL.
The atomic model relaxed using DFT calculations (Figure 2i) shows a staggered arrangement
of SVLs in the bottom layer.

(o) (2S/Mo)1 and (Mo/S), (p) (Mo/S) and (2S/Mo)2, and (q) (2S/Mo)1 and (2S/Mo)2.

To quantify the lattice distortion introduced by
each SVL in 2H
bilayer MoS2 (Figure 2n), we measured the boxed line profiles across (Mo/2S)–(2S/Mo)1–(Mo/S)–(2S/Mo)2 columns, as marked
by green dashed rectangles for 1SVL (A), A-2SVL (B and C), B-2SVL
(D and E), and 3SVL (F and G). The distance between each column is
determined by fitting Gaussian curves and plotted for A–G in Figure 2o–q. For 1SVL,
the (2S/Mo)1–(Mo/S), (Mo/S)–(2S/Mo)2, and (2S/Mo)1–(2S/Mo)2 distances are
3.52, 1.83, and 5.38 Å, respectively. The negligible shrinkage
compared to the column distances in pristine 2H bilayer MoS2 confirms minimal compression in the system when losing seven S atoms
in a layer. The line profiles along directions B and C, the left-side
SVL in A-2SVL, show no (2S/Mo)1–(Mo/S) distance
change but a slight drop in the (Mo/S)–(2S/Mo)2 and
(2S/Mo)1–(2S/Mo)2 distances. However,
for the right-side SVL, the (2S/Mo)1–(Mo/S) and
(2S/Mo)1–(2S/Mo)2 distances shrink to
3.04 and 4.90 Å, with a small increase in the (2S/Mo)1–(Mo/S) distance. These changes indicate greater compression
introduced between the two staggered SVLs. For the right-side SVL,
the (2S/Mo)1–(Mo/S) distance increment, indicating
tension, is caused by the displacement of S atoms in (Mo/S) toward
the (2S/Mo) column. The directions D and E in B-2SVL both show compression
along the armchair direction. Compared to those in A-2SVL, no tension
exists in the defective regions and the contraction is relatively
smaller, indicating that the configuration having one sulfur vacancy
line in each layer introduces less strain into the bilayer system.
The staggered 3SVL shows expansion of the (Mo/S)–(2S/Mo)2 distance and shrinkage of the (2S/Mo)1–(2S/Mo)2 distance, as expected.

Figure 3a shows
a multislice image simulation
of 2H-stacked bilayer MoS2 with an infinitely long 1SVL
running through the bottom layer on the DFT-calculated atomic model
in Figure 3b. As discussed
before, the introduction of 1SVL introduces negligible out-of-plane
and in-plane lattice distortions. To compare the difference between the SVLs
in the monolayer and bilayer system, as shown in Figure 3d, layer B is DFT-calculated
model for monolayer MoS2 with 1SVL running through, another
pristine MoS2 monolayer is manually placed on top to create
similar 2H stacking configuration, taking the circled column as the
alignment point. The corresponding multislice image
simulation in Figure 3c shows considerable lattice distortion on the right-hand side of
the 1SVL, resulting from the mismatch between two layers. Layers A
and B are then extracted and stacked, as shown in Figure 3e; the column circled in black
is chosen as the alignment point. From the side view, a large discrepancy
in the out-of-plane distortion between layers A and B can be distinguished.
To quantify the lattice mismatch in the system, 2D displacement maps
from the x, y, and z axes are constructed in Figure 3f–h, respectively. The reference point is circled
in white. The displacement maps show significant compression with
increased magnitude in the x direction. However,
the lattice mismatch in the y direction is uniformly
distributed and relatively small. The displacement map in the Z axis shows a centrosymmetric configuration, with most
significant Z-direction distortion in the defective
site and lowest, in the reference point, further confirming a large
out-of-plane distortion difference between the two layers. We further
measure the bond length of Mo–S in the defective site (shown
in Figure S5). Compared to the value of
2.41 in pristine MoS2, the maximum bond length deviation
for layers A and B is, respectively, 3.7 and 6.6%, indicating that
the compression in the x direction also mainly comes
from the out-of-plane distortion. Therefore, SVLs in the monolayer
system introduce slightly larger in-plane lattice deformations than
those in their bilayer counterparts. However, the main discrepancy
between the defective layer in monolayer and bilayer systems is the
out-of-plane distortion. The considerable buckling introduced by SVLs
in monolayer MoS2 becomes insignificant in bilayer system,
mainly compensated by the interlayer van der Waals force.

The sequential AC-TEM images in Figure 4a show the dynamics
of S vacancies in 2H-stacked
bilayer MoS2 during 89 s of electron beam irradiation.
A different false color look up table (LUT) is applied to highlight
every SV in each frame (Figure 4b). In Figure 4c, the gray scale image with red dots indicating SVs shows that during
the first 25 s the 3SVL gains length in the B-zigzag direction. Vacancies
initially aggregate along the A-zigzag direction from 25 to 43 s.
Over the latter 46 s, a large number of vacancies along the B-zigzag
direction are quenched and the SVL transforms to 3SVL along the A-zigzag
direction. In the first 43 s, newly ejected S atoms adjacent to the
3SVL are introduced under electron beam irradiation. In the next 46
s, vacancies along the B-zigzag direction get quenched by free S atoms
or migrate in the A-zigzag direction.

darker spots using different false color LUTs. (c) Gray scale image
showing vacancy migration and 3SVL rotation from the B-zigzag to the

A monolayer–3R-stacked
bilayer interface has also been observed in our study (Figure S2c,d). Figure 5a shows a typical AC-TEM image of 3R-stacked
bilayer MoS2, in which a large number of bright spots (marked
by white and purple arrows) and blurred regions (marked by green and
red arrows) are observed. Magnified AC-TEM images in Figure 5b–e indicate SVs (SV1 and SV2) and DVs (DV1 and DV2) as blurred regions, bright spots, heavily blurred regions, and
brighter spots, respectively. The existence of 3R-stacked bilayer
MoS2 is confirmed by imaging the structure under different
defocus values, leading to contrast pattern variations that the 2H
structure cannot exhibit. The corresponding multislice image simulations
under different defocus values match the experimental results (Figure S4). Atomic models relaxed by DFT (Figure 5f–i) and their
corresponding multislice image simulations (Figure 5j–m) indicate that the blurriness
is due to losing one (SV1) or two (DV1) S atoms
in a 2S/Mo column and that the bright contrast is due to losing one
(SV2) or two (DV2) S atoms in a 2S column. Intensity
line profiles along the yellow arrows in both simulated and experimental
images are taken covering the defective site. For both SVs (SV1 and SV2), the Mo–Mo column distance remains
close to that in pristine 3R bilayer MoS2 (5.4 Å),
implying that nearly no compression is introduced to the bilayer by
losing one S atom. In contrast, a column distance shrinkage of ∼5%
is observed for both DV1 and DV2, indicating
small contraction caused by losing both S atoms in 2S or Mo/2S columns.
These results are consistent with those
on the SVs/DVs in 2H bilayer MoS2. Further confirmation
of the existence of SVs/DVs in 3R-stacked bilayer MoS2 is
obtained by measuring the peak intensity ratio at multiple defective
sites, as shown in Figures 5n–q and S3.

(i) two missing S atoms in the S–S column, respectively. Vacancies
are marked as colored balls in the top view and crosses in the 3D
view. (n–q) Boxed line profiles taken along the yellow dashed
rectangles marked A–H.

Processed AC-TEM images in Figure 6a,b highlight SV2/DV2 and SV1/DV1 as bright spots and dark regions,
respectively. Figure 6c demonstrates the
evolution of SV2/DV2 (green) and SV1/DV1 (red) under electron beam irradiation. The number
of each SV is calculated as a function of time, as displayed in the
histogram (Figure 6d) and plot (Figure 6e). Throughout the frames, the ratio of SV1/DV1 to SV2/DV2 increases from 2.5:1 to 4.9:1,
indicating the dominance of SV1/DV1. Therefore,
for 3R-stacked bilayer MoS2, under 80 kV irradiation, the
S atoms in the 2S columns are more stable and less likely to be sputtered
compared to those in the Mo/2S columns. Over 71 s, the SV2/DV2 number drops slightly, whereas the density of SV1/DV1 increases, especially in the last 37 s. Hence,
the most newly produced SV1/DV1 are derived
from the prolonged irradiation. However, vacancy migration also happen
from SV2/DV2 to SV1/DV1, implying vacancy migration between layers in 3R bilayer MoS2.

Conclusions
AC-TEM imaging is conducted under an accelerating
voltage of 80
kV, allowing production and aggregation of vacancies as well as atomic-level
resolution of defective regions in bilayer MoS2. DFT-calculated
models prove the different production and migration mechanisms between
sulfur vacancies in monolayer and bilayer systems. The combination
of DFT calculations and dislocation maps reveal that the main discrepancy
between defective monolayer and bilayer systems is the out-of-plane
lattice distortions. The ability for the bilayer sheet to accommodate
the buckling and compression caused by line defects can be assigned
to the competition between compression in one layer from the loss
of S atoms and the interlayer van der Waals force.

Methods
MoS2 CVD Synthesis and Transfer
The synthesis
of MoS2 was executed in two individually controlled quartz
tube furnaces with only Ar flowing at atmospheric pressure using S
powder (1 g of purum grade >99.5%) and MoO3 powder.
The
MoO3 precursor was initially loaded in a 1 cm diameter
tube, which was in turn placed inside a larger diameter (1 in.) tube
of the CVD furnace. This was to prevent cross-contamination of S and
MoO3 prior to MoS2 formation on the target substrate,
with the S kept separate in the larger diameter outer tube. Two furnaces
were used to control the temperature of each precursor and the substrate,
with heating temperatures of S at 180 °C, MoO3 at
300 °C, and the substrate at 800 °C. Ar was used as a carrier
gas. The S was left to vaporize for an initial 15 min before the temperature
of the second furnace was increased to 800 °C at 40 °C min–1 and left for 15 min under an Ar flow of 150 sccm.
The Ar flow was then reduced to 10 sccm for 25 min, followed by a
fast cooling process (sample removal). The S temperature was kept
at 180 °C throughout.

The as-grown sample was first spin-coated
with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) scaffold (8 wt % in anisole,
495k molecular weight) at 4700 rpm for 60 s and then cured at 150
°C for 15 min. The edge of the wafer was ground with a diamond
file to expose the SiO2/Si edges to the etchant solution.
The underlying SiO2/Si substrate was subsequently detached
by floating the sample on a 15 M KOH (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in a
water bath for 2 h at 40 °C. The suspended PMMA–MoS2 film was thoroughly cleaned by transferring and floating
onto fresh deionized water several times. For the TEM characterization,
the PMMA–MoS2 film was transferred onto a holey
Quantifoil TEM grid and left to dry overnight in air. PMMA–MoS2–Quantifoil was subsequently baked at 150 °C for
15 min to improve sample adhesion. The sample was eventually prepared
by removing PMMA using an 8 h acetone solution bath.

Electron Microscopy
AC-TEM was performed at an accelerating
voltage of 80 kV using Oxford’s JEOL 2200MCO, with an imaging
CEOS corrector. The beam current density under imaging conditions
was ∼105 e nm–2 s–1, with typical exposure times of 1–3 s.

Image Simulations
and Processing
Multislice image simulations
were conducted using JEMS software with an 80 kV accelerating voltage,
5 nm defocus spread, 3 nm (for 2H stacking) or 9 nm (for 3R stacking)
defocus value, and 5 μm Cs. To match the AC-TEM image in Figure S2d, the simulation in Figure S2h was performed using 1.6 nm twofold astigmatism
and 300 nm second-order coma (180°). The brightness and contrast
of the simulated images were adjusted according to the intensity of
the known columns in the experimental images, such as the (2S/Mo),
(2S), and (S/Mo) columns.

ImageJ was used to process the AC-TEM
images. A bandpass filter (between 100 and 1 pixels) and a Gaussian
blur were carefully applied to minimize long-range uneven illumination
without affecting the interpretation of the original image. Figure 4b was processed by an 8 pixel
Gaussian blur, followed by a “find edge” filter, then
another 8 pixel Gaussian blur, and then using an “orange hot”-colored
LUT, and finally, the contrast and brightness were adjusted. In Figure 6a, bright SVs in
bilayer 3R-stacked MoS2 were processed by fast Fourier
transform (FFT) band pass (100-1 pixels) and then a Gaussian blur
of 12 pixels, followed by contrast adjustment. Dark S vacancies, as shown in Figure 6b, were processed
by an FFT band pass filter (100-1 pixels), then a Gaussian blur of
8 pixels, followed by a find edge filter, and then another 6 pixel
Gaussian blur, and then, the contrast was adjusted.

DFT Calculation
Standard ab initio simulations within
the DFT were performed, using the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP v5.4),37 to explore the atomic structures
of 2D MoS2 bilayers with various defects in the 2H and
3R stacking configurations. Plane-wave and projector-augmented-wave
type pseudopotentials were adopted,38 with
kinetic-energy cutoffs of up to 300 eV and the generalized gradient
approximation-Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation
functional.39 The DFT-D2 method of Grimme
was implemented to account for the Van der Waals interactions,40 with a 50 Å cutoff radius for pair interactions.
To eliminate artificial interactions between periodic images, a 20
Å vacuum was constructed in the direction perpendicular to that
of the sheets. The initial structures were generated on the basis
of the TEM images and relaxed until all forces were smaller than 0.02
eV Å–1. The Γ point was used for geometric
optimization of S vacancies and finite line defects, whereas a Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid41 of 9 × 1
× 1 was employed in relaxation of infinite line defects.
