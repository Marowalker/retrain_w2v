Synthesizing iron
oxide nanoparticles for positive contrast in
magnetic resonance imaging is the most promising approach to bring
this nanomaterial back to the clinical field. The success of this
approach depends on several aspects: the longitudinal relaxivity values,
the complexity of the synthetic protocol, and the reproducibility
of the synthesis. Here, we show our latest results on this goal. We
have studied the effect of Cu doping on the physicochemical, magnetic,
and relaxometric properties of iron oxide nanoparticles designed to
provide positive contrast in magnetic resonance imaging. We have used
a one-step, 10 min synthesis to produce nanoparticles with excellent
colloidal stability. We have synthesized three different Cu-doped
iron oxide nanoparticles showing modest to very large longitudinal
relaxivity values. Finally, we have demonstrated the in vivo use of
these kinds of nanoparticles both in angiography and targeted molecular
imaging.

1 Introduction
The
reduction of transverse relaxation time (T2) and the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of water protons are the two main types of contrasts
generated in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The first approach
produces a darkening of the areas in the image where the probe has
accumulated, whereas the second renders a brightening of the image.
For technical and physiological reasons, a T1-based contrast is preferred by radiologists and physicians
for diagnostic purposes. From the imaging point of view, this is a
key aspect, being one of the main reasons why “traditional”
iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), for T2-weighted imaging, have not been established as an alternative in
the clinical practice. The quest for new iron oxide nanoparticle-based
probes for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has traditionally focused
on the obtainment of transverse relaxivity values (r2) as large as possible.1 Over
the last years, the attention has moved to the development of IONPs
as “positive” contrast agents, showing large longitudinal
relaxivity values (r1). The rationale
behind this approach is trying to get the best of both worlds: commonly
used contrast agents in MRI, Gd chelates, and nanoparticles. In other
words, to have a good, easy to spot, signal in MRI without a noticeable
toxicity, multifunctionalization, and the possibility of easily tuning
the pharmacokinetics of the probe. Two aspects are crucial for a good T1-based contrast agent: a large r1 value and a small r2/r1 ratio. The most common approach to obtain
IONPs as T1 contrast agents is by reducing
the core size. Due to the large surface effects, IONPs become more
paramagnetic than superparamagnetic and the inner-sphere relaxation
mechanism of water protons dominates.2 Alternatively,
it is possible to modify the chemistry of the coating molecules on
the nanoparticles to obtain T1-weighted
contrast out of IONPs in vivo.3 A third
option is the core doping of the IONPs with different metals: a few
examples describe an increase of the r2 values (using Co, Ni, Zn, or combinations of them)4−7 and fewer for positive contrast (mainly with Mn or Gd as the doping
metal).8−10 The use of Cu as a dopant, alone or in combination
with other metals, in iron oxide nanoparticles, is limited, compared,
for example, to its use as a dopant in ZnO nanoparticles. Cu doping
effect has been studied in catalysis,11 sensor performance,12,13 and in the magnetic properties
of the nanomaterial.14−16 The use of Cu as a dopant for molecular imaging is
limited, with one example, in combination with Co, using nanorods
for MRI17 and one example where the 64Cu radioisotope is used for positron emission tomography.18 Interestingly, in both cases, the relaxometric
properties of the nanomaterials make them suitable exclusively for T2-weighted MRI (dark contrast). Furthermore,
there are no studies on the use of Cu doping as a way to obtain nanoparticles
for positive contrast MRI.

The use of microwave-driven synthesis
(MWS) for the production
of nanomaterials is a versatile and highly reproducible approach.
We have demonstrated how this methodology can produce, in extremely
short times, homogeneous nanoparticles with excellent properties for
molecular imaging.3,19 However, in the production of
nanoparticles for T1-weighted MRI, the
use of MWS is far from common. Most of the syntheses used for the
production of T1 nanoparticles are characterized
by time-consuming protocols,8−10,20,21 multistep approaches,9,10,22−26 or the use of organic solvents.22−26

Here, we have studied the effect of Cu doping
of iron oxide nanoparticles
on their relaxometric properties. In a 10 min, one-pot synthesis,
we have produced Cu core-doped IONP (Cu-NP) with the largest longitudinal
relaxivity value described so far, at clinically relevant magnetic
fields. We have fully characterized the new nanomaterial and demonstrated
its suitability for in vivo use in angiography and targeted molecular
imaging for the enhanced diagnosis of tumors in animal models.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 One-Pot Microwave-Driven
Synthesis of Cu-Doped
Hydrophilic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
Microwave synthesis
of nanoparticles is a reliable, reproducible, and extremely fast way
for the production of small iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). We recently
used this approach to tune the relaxivity values of extremely small
iron oxide nanoparticles, from T2 agents
to T1 agents.3 Here, we have synthesized three different iron oxide nanoparticles
with an increasing amount of Cu core doping (Figure 1a). In a typical synthesis, we mixed FeCl3, sodium citrate, and hydrazine with different amounts of
CuCl2 (15, 45, and 74 μmol); after 10 min of heating
at 120 °C, we purified the nanoparticles by size exclusion chromatography.
After purification, we quantified the amount of Cu in the samples
by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS): 1.7 mol
% (sample Cu1.7-NP), 4 mol % (sample Cu4-NP), and 28 mol % (sample
Cu28-NP).

size distribution, measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS); (c) Z-average size (mean with standard deviation, N = 5, P = 0.0001) and (d) ζ-potential for
iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), Cu1.7-NP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP; and
(e) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and (f) thermogravimetric
curves for Cu1.7-NP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP.

2.2 Physicochemical Characterization of Cu-Doped
Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
Hydrodynamic size distributions
(Figure 1b) are narrow
for all of the samples. Samples IONP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP show the
same size distribution, whereas for the sample with the lowest amount
of Cu (Cu1.7-NP), the size is smaller. This is confirmed by plotting
the Z-average values for each sample (Figure 1c). Sample Cu1.7-NP shows a
much smaller size (7.7 ± 0.6 nm) than the other nanoparticles
in this study; values for IONP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP are 15.0 ±
1.0, 16.1 ± 0.7, and 16.0 ± 1.5 nm, respectively. ζ-Potential
measurements show no significant differences between samples (Figure 1d) with homogeneous
values around −34 mV as expected for citrate-coated nanoparticles.

FTIR spectra for the three Cu-doped samples show the expected bands
(Figure 1e); bands
corresponding to citrate coating appear at 1580, 1380, and 1090 cm–1. The band with maxima at 1580 cm–1 is wider for Cu28-NP (from 1460 to 1720 cm–1),
most likely due to the presence of the Cu–O band that normally
appears at around 1640 cm–1. A strong band due to
iron oxide is observed in all three spectra at 560 cm–1. Further analysis in the region between 800 and 400 cm–1 shows at least a band at a higher wavelength than 600 cm–1, indicating that the sample is mainly composed of maghemite rather
than magnetite.3 Thermogravimetric analysis
shows the same curves for the three samples. We found three different
steps at around 120, 380, and 480 °C; this mass loss in a stepwise
manner is typical of citrate-coated nanoparticles.27 All samples show a thick organic layer, about 50% of weight
loss, which ensures their colloidal stability and the availability
of carboxylic groups for bioconjugation.

Electron microscopy
of these samples is often difficult; a small
core and a thick organic layer complicate acquiring quality images.
The same happens with X-ray diffraction (XRD), which normally produces
broad peaks difficult to identify. To ameliorate this issue, we treated
the samples (Cu1.7-NP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP), prior analysis, with
the enzyme citrate lyase. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible aldol
cleavage of citrate to oxaloacetate and acetate. Our hypothesis was
that by cleaving citrate the organic layer would be at least partially
reduced so scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images
would be better and XRD peaks would be more clearly defined. Figure 2 shows selected STEM-HAADF
images of the three samples (more images are shown in the Supporting Information). Images reveal small
cores for all of them, similar to IONPs produced with this approach.3 We can observe individual, dispersed nanoparticles,
for all three samples. The core size of the nanoparticles, measured
by STEM, also shows that Cu1.7-NP has the lowest value (3.2 ±
0.9 nm) and Cu4-NP has a similar core size (3.5 ± 0.8 nm), whereas
IONP (4.2 ± 1.0 nm) and Cu28-NP (4.4 ± 2.9 nm) show the
largest values. Interestingly, Cu28-NP, the sample with the largest
amount of Cu, shows a much higher heterogeneity than the other nanoparticles
in the core size (Figure 2d), which is also reflected in the quality of the images (Figure 2c). Energy dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analysis of the samples confirms the results obtained
by ICP-MS, an increase in the Cu/Fe ratio from Cu1.7-NP to Cu28-NP
(Figure 2e).

Figure 2 Selected STEM-HAADF
images of (a) Cu1.7-NP, (b) Cu4-NP, and (c)
Cu28-NP; (d) core size measured by STEM (mean with standard deviation, N = 30, P = 0.01); (e) ratio of Cu/Fe counts
in EDX; and (f) XRD profiles for the three samples.

The effect of the enzyme is noticeable in the quality
of the XRD
spectra. A comparison with previous data on IONP, without enzymatic
treatment, clearly shows that now the peaks are more defined and easier
to identify.3 The increase in Cu doping
results in a slight displacement of the main peak (311) toward larger
angles and the decrease of the intensity in the peaks.15 Using the Scherrer equation, we calculated the
crystallite sizes for the three nanoparticles: 2.9 nm for Cu1.7-NP;
3.5 nm for Cu4-NP; and 3.4 nm for Cu28-NP, in good agreement with
the core sizes measured by STEM. The field-dependent magnetization
data (Figure 3a) show
negligible coercivity values for all of the samples, confirming their
superparamagnetic behavior. The incorporation of increasing amounts
of Cu significantly reduces the saturation magnetization of the sample,
even for the smallest amounts of Cu.

Figure 3 (a) Magnetization curves at 298 K and
(b) temperature dependence
of AC magnetic susceptibility for IONP, Cu1.7-NP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP.

Saturation magnetization values
are 76.6 ± 0.3 emu g–1 Fe + Cu for Cu1.7-NP,
56.2 ± 0.3 emu g–1 Fe
+ Cu for Cu4-NP, and 43.8 ± 0.4 emu g–1 Fe
+ Cu for Cu28-NP, showing the dilution effect given by the increasing
proportion of copper. However, if we express the saturation magnetization
on iron basis, we obtain 78.2 ± 0.3 emu g–1 Fe for Cu1.7-NP, 58.4 ± 0.3 emu g–1 Fe for
Cu4-NP, and 63.3 ± 0.4 emu g–1 Fe for Cu28-NP.
This unexpected high value for Cu28-NP supports the core–shell
structure for this sample where the excess of Cu is mainly located
on the surface of the nanoparticle core. The temperature dependence
of the out-of-phase susceptibility shows maxima located in the range
between 15 and 22 K for all samples, together with maxima in the in-phase
susceptibility at slightly higher temperatures (data not shown) typical
of the relaxation procedure of nanoparticles (Figure 3b). The location of the out-of-phase susceptibility
is influenced by the size distribution, composition, and aggregation
(dipolar interactions) of the particles. A mixture of factors affects
our results; the increase in the Cu amount (that would probably reduce
the saturation magnetization values and the temperature location of
the susceptibility maxima) is associated with an increase in the particle
size (Figures 1 and 2) that would have the opposite effect. The negligible
out-of-phase susceptibility values at temperatures above 100 K indicate
the superparamagnetic behavior of these particles at room temperature,
in agreement with the negligible coercivity observed in the field-dependent
magnetization data.

2.3 Relaxometric Characterization
of Cu-Doped
Nanoparticles
After this comprehensive physicochemical characterization,
we focused on our main goal, that is, the study of the effect on the
relaxometric values of Cu core doping. Figure 4a–c shows the plot of averaged points
for r2 and r1 for the three nanoparticles. In all cases, we observe a good linear
fitting of the measured points and a good reproducibility. A comparison
of the relaxometric values for the three Cu-doped nanoparticles (Figure 4d–f) shows
some remarkable results. The longitudinal relaxivity (r1, Figure 4d) shows that sample Cu4-NP has a large r1 value (15.7 ± 0.6 mM–1 s–1), significantly larger than that for iron oxide nanoparticles (11.9
± 0.3 mM–1 s–1). The r2 value is also larger for Cu4-NP; however,
the r2/r1 ratio
is pretty low (2.1), in summary, excellent conditions for T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Sample
Cu1.7-NP also shows an improved performance in the longitudinal relaxivity
(13.6 ± 0.3 mM–1 s–1), compared
to that of IONP. The transversal relaxivity value is similar to that
for Cu4-NP, and the r2/r1 ratio is slightly larger. These properties make Cu1.7-NP
also an optimal contrast agent for T1-weighted
imaging, second only to the excellent results for Cu4-NP. Finally,
the sample with the largest amount of Cu shows poor performance as
an MRI contrast agent. The r1 value (8.5
± 1.3 mM–1 s–1) is much smaller
than the value for IONP, and the r2/r1 ratio is the largest for the series (2.4).
The relaxometric study shows that, under tested conditions, a 4 mol
% doping provides the best properties for an improved T1 contrast. A large doping percentage, as in Cu28-NP,
renders nanoparticles with worse T1 contrast
than that of nanoparticles without doping.

iron and copper concentration for
(a) Cu1.7-NP, (b) Cu4-NP, and (c) Cu28-NP. Plots of (d) r1 (mean with standard deviation, N =
5, P = 0.001), (e) r2 (mean with standard deviation, N = 5, P = 0.0001), and (f) r2/r1 for IONP, Cu1.7-NP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP.

Magnetic measurements suggest a core–shell
structure for
Cu28-NP, with most of the Cu atoms on the surface; this explains the
small r1 value since Cu atoms on the surface
would reduce the contribution of the inner-sphere relaxation mechanism.
In Cu1.7-NP, we see an improvement in the T1 signal but lower than for the 4% doping conditions. It seems that
around this doping percentage we obtained the appropriate reduction
of the magnetization, keeping enough Fe atoms on the surface. The
1.7% doping is too small to see the full effect, whereas the 28% doping
seems too large to keep the desirable relaxometric properties of the
iron oxides prepared this way. Surface coating thickness is a key
parameter to improve r1 values, as we
have demonstrated before.3 Cu4-NP coating
is thinner than IONP coating; this feature also contributes to increase
the longitudinal relaxivity value (Figure S4). The r1 values shown by Cu4-NP are
similar to or larger than those of many clinical Gd- and Mn-based
compounds, and Cu4-NP has a low r2/r1 ratio.30 We can
compare these results with those of nanoparticles for T1-weighted MRI published in recent years (Table 1). This table includes not only
iron oxide nanoparticles but also Gd- and Mn-based compounds. The
performance of an MRI contrast agent for T1-weighted imaging is based on the r1 value
and the r2/r1 ratio. The larger the r1 value and the
smaller the r2/r1 ratio, the better. Considering this, Cu4-NPs are one of the
best suited nanoparticles for positive contrast MRI thus far reported.
These nanoparticles have one of the largest r1 values and one of the smallest r2/r1 ratios. It is noteworthy how the
combination of citric acid and iron oxide can produce nanoparticles
with large r1 values but poor r2/r1 ratios.24 One of the few examples of iron oxide nanoparticles
doped with Cu shows good relaxometric properties but for T2-weighted imaging, confirming the nanoparticles must
be considered as a whole to optimize the MRI performance. SPIONS21 and MION28 show remarkable
properties as T1 agents, with large r1 values. However, this is usually achieved
after a lengthy and time-consuming synthesis and purification. This
can compromise the reproducibility and is certainly not the best scenario
for clinical translation. These nanoparticles also show a relatively
thin organic layer that could complicate their stability under physiological
conditions. In the case of Cu4-NP, we achieved one of the best relaxometric
properties, in one single step and with a thick organic coating, ensuring
their colloidal stability under most relevant physiological conditions.

2.4 Magnetic Resonance Angiography
with Cu-Doped
Nanoparticles
A good contrast agent for in vivo magnetic
resonance imaging must have excellent relaxometric properties. This
alone is insufficient, and appropriate in vivo behavior, factors like
pharmacokinetics and colloidal stability under physiological conditions,
must be checked; for this, the best test is an in vivo image. We carried
out magnetic resonance angiography with Cu1.7-NP, Cu4-NP, and Cu28-NP
(Figure 5) to check
the potential of their T1 signals. We
acquired images before nanoparticle injection (baseline) and 15, 30,
and 45 min post injection. The differences between the nanoparticle
samples are clear. Angiography with Cu4-NP provides high-quality images
with fine details of the vasculature up to 30 min post injection.

in healthy mice, before and after the intravenous injection, 0.04
mmol Fe kg–1, of (a) Cu1.7-NP, (b) Cu4-NP, and (c)
Cu28-NP.

The use of Cu1.7-NP provides positive
contrast after 15 min, although
the signal is not that clear as that for Cu4-NP; then, the signal
becomes weaker after 30 min of circulation. We attribute this difference
to the r1 and r2/r1 values for Cu4-NP since the circulating
time for Cu1.7-NP is similar to that for Cu4-NP (Figure S5), discarding a rapid renal elimination as the cause
for this difference. Angiographic images with Cu28-NP show the poorest
results due to the smaller r1 value, half
of that for Cu4-NP, and a shorter circulation time.

2.5 Tumor Detection by Magnetic Resonance Imaging:
Comparison between IONP and Cu4-NP
We have shown that Cu4-NPs
provide an excellent signal in angiographic MRI with adequate in vivo
behavior. We wanted to verify the use of this new contrast agent using
actively targeted molecular imaging and compare it with the undoped
nanoparticles, IONPs. We designed a classical experiment, that is,
targeting vascular angiogenesis toward integrin αvβ3 in tumor models using RGD peptide as a vector.
We conjugated the peptide on the surface of both IONP and Cu4-NP,
which are similar in terms of chemical composition and thickness of
the organic layer. Using EDC/sulfoNHS to activate carboxylic groups
on the surface, we bound the RGD peptide by amide formation with citric
acid carboxylate groups. We measured the hydrodynamic size and ζ-potential
for the RGD-functionalized nanoparticles (Figure S6), showing a different value of 31.9 nm for Cu4-NP–RGD
and 37.3 nm for IONP–RGD. ζ-Potential values are the
same in both cases, suggesting a similar functionalization of the
surface (−12.9 mV for Cu4-NP–RGD vs −12.0 mV
for IONP–RGD). After RGD quantification on the nanoparticle
surface (Bradford assay), we obtained a value of 16.1 RGD molecules
per IONP and 15.9 molecules of RGD per Cu4-NP. We performed in vivo
MRI experiments in mouse breast cancer allograft models, after the
intravenous injection of four different nanoparticles, IONP, Cu4-NP,
IONP–RGD, and Cu4-NP–RGD.

Figure 6 shows the MR data obtained 1 h after the
intravenous injection of the different NPs. We show images with the
normal contrast (left panels in each image) and also setting the muscle
contrast intensity to 0 (right panels in each image) to better appreciate
the possible increase in the tumor signal. Differences are dramatic.
First, we can discard the accumulation of the nanoparticles in the
tumor due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect since
there is no significant signal in the tumor after the injection of
either IONP (Figure 6a) or Cu4-NP (Figure 6c). The situation is different after the injection of the functionalized
NPs. The image after the injection of IONP–RGD shows a modest
increase in the tumor signal (Figure S7); however, when muscle pixels are set to 0, the tumor is barely
distinguishable from this reference. The situation is completely different
for Cu4-NP–RGD. Figure 6d (left panel) clearly shows an increase in the signal compared
to that from the muscle and also when compared to that in Figure 6c. This signal increase
is even more clearly displayed when the muscle intensity is set to
0; the tumor is clearly observable owing to a 30% increase in the
MRI signal (Figure S6). The difference
in hydrodynamic size between IONP–RGD and Cu4-NP–RGD
(Figure S6) can contribute to this difference
but in a minor proportion. The main reason for this outstanding result
obtained with Cu4-NP–RGD is the very large r1 value obtained, significantly larger than the r1 value for the undoped nanoparticles. To further
explain this, we measured the relaxivity values for Cu4-NP and IONP
at 7 T. We measured r1 values of 2.7 mM–1 s–1 for Cu4-NP and 2.8 mM–1 s–1 for IONP. However, the r2 values are 38.7 mM–1 s–1 for Cu4-NP and 88.5 mM–1 s–1 for IONP. These values permit us to get a good T1 contrast at a high field with Cu4-NP samples but not
with IONP because of the large r2 value,
explaining the large differences observed at 7 T in vivo for tumor
detection.

Left panels show normal contrast images, and right panels are obtained
after setting the muscle intensity to 0 to highlight the possible
increase in the tumor signal. All MRI images were acquired (see the Experimental Section) with the same parameters.

3 Conclusions
The search for better contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging
has implications for both basic and translational research. The synthesis
and application of nanoparticles for positive contrast are particularly
interesting since these will boost the use of nanomaterials in this
imaging technique, key for many clinical applications. In this work,
we show for the first time how the use of Cu, as a dopant, enhances
the positive contrast in vivo performance of iron oxide nanoparticles.
We have fully characterized the nanoparticles and demonstrated the
in vivo use of this nanomaterial, both as a blood pool contrast agent
and for targeted molecular imaging, which is key for further development
and applications. The relaxometric values, the type of synthesis,
and the in vivo performance make Cu4-NP a remarkable candidate for
future clinical translation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of IONP–Citrate Samples
A mixture
of FeCl3·6H2O (75 mg) and
citric acid trisodium salt (80 mg) was dissolved in water (9 mL).
Subsequently, hydrazine monohydrate (1 mL) was added and the mixture
was rapidly introduced into the microwave. Samples were heated under
vigorous stirring at 240 W for 10 min at 120 °C. Once this step
was completed, nanoparticles were purified through a gel filtration
column (PD10) to eliminate unreacted species and stored in glass vials
for further characterization.

4.2 Synthesis
of Cu-NP–Citrate Samples
A mixture of FeCl3·6H2O (75 mg), citric
acid trisodium salt (80 mg), and CuCl2 (2, 6, or 10 mg)
was dissolved in water (9 mL). Subsequently, hydrazine monohydrate
(1 mL) was added and the mixture was rapidly introduced into the microwave.
Samples were heated under vigorous stirring at 240 W for 10 min at
120 °C. Once this step was completed, nanoparticles were purified
through a gel filtration column (PD10) to eliminate unreacted species
and stored in glass vials for further characterization.

4.3 Cu-NP Treatment with Citrate Lyase
Citrate lyase (300
μL, 40 mg mL–1 in PBS
1×) was added to 1 mL of each Cu-NP sample. The mixture was kept
under vigorous stirring for 90 min at room temperature. Once this
step was completed, samples were purified by ultrafiltration using
10 kDa cutoff filters and resuspended in water.

4.4 Synthesis of IONP–RGD
The
cycloRGD peptide was covalently attached to carboxyl groups in the
citrate coating by EDC/sulfoNHS chemistry, yielding IONP–RGD.
1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC,
12 mg) and 15 mg of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS)
were added to 5 mL of IONP. The mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 30 min and posteriorly purified by ultrafiltration using 30 kDa
cutoff filters. Filtered nanoparticles were diluted in buffer 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) pH 8 to 1.8 mL and 1 mg of cycloRGD was then added and
mixture stirred at room temperature for 60 min. Once this step was
completed, the sample was purified by ultrafiltration and resuspended
in saline.

4.5 Synthesis of Cu-NP–RGD
CycloRGD
was covalently attached to carboxyl groups in the citrate coating
by EDC/sulfoNHS chemistry, yielding Cu-NP–RGD. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC, 12 mg) and 15 mg of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
(NHS) were added to 5 mL of Cu-NP. The mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 30 min and posteriorly purified by ultrafiltration
using 30 kDa cutoff filters. Filtered nanoparticles were diluted in
buffer HEPES, pH 8, to 1.8 mL and 1 mg of cycloRGD was then added,
and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 60 min. Once this
step was completed, the sample was purified by ultrafiltration and
resuspended in saline.

4.6 IONP and Cu-NP Hydrodynamic
Size and ζ-Potential
Measurements
Hydrodynamic size and ζ-potential of samples
were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS). A Zetasizer Nano
ZS (Malvern Instruments) was used to this end. This device is equipped
with a He–Ne laser operating at 633 nm and 4 mW and an avalanche
photodiode detector.

4.7 MRI Relaxation Properties
of IONP and Cu-NP
Relaxometric properties of the samples
were assessed by measuring
longitudinal and transverse relaxation times. Four concentrations
of each nanoparticle sample were selected, and longitudinal and transversal
relaxation times of each one were measured using a Bruker Minispec
mq60 contrast agent analyzer at 1.5 T and 37 °C. The r1 and r2 values
were plotted against the Fe concentration (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2
mM).

4.8 In Vivo MRI Acquisition
MRI equipment
used in this study was an Agilent/Varian scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA) equipped with a DD2 console and an actively shielded 205/120 gradient
insert coil with 130 mT m–1 maximum gradient strength,
a TX/RX volume quadrature coil, and a 1H circularly polarized
transmit–receive volume coil of 35 mm inner diameter and 30
mm active length built by Neos Biotec (Pamplona, Spain). For angiography
study, mice weighing 30 g were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and
oxygen before being placed on a thermoregulated (38 °C) mouse
bed. An ophthalmic gel was applied in the eyes to prevent retinal
damage due to drying. The three-dimensional gradient echo with magnetization
transfer contrast (MTC) prepulse MRA was performed with the following
parameters: min TR, 12.64 ms; min TE, 2.32 ms; flip angle, 20°;
two averages; acquisition matrix, 256 × 192 × 128; MTC flip
angle, 810°; duration, 6 ms; and offset frequency, 2000 Hz. For
tumor MRI experiments, axial T1-weighted
spin echo images were acquired with the following parameters: TR,
2072 ms; TE, 27.9 ms; NA, 8; matrix, 256 × 256; FOV, 30 ×
30 mm2; 20 consecutive 0.5 mm slices; and spectral width,
125 000 Hz.
