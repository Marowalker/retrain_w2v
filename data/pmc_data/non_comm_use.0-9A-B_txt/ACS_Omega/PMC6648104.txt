The lithium–sulfur battery
is one of the most promising
battery technologies with high energy density that exceeds the presently
commercialized ones. The shuttle effect caused by the migration of
soluble polysulfides to the lithium anode is known as one of the crucial
issues that prevent the Li–S batteries from practical application.
Modification of the separator is regarded as a convenient yet efficient
strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect. In this report, we use a
thermally stable and chemically robust metal–organic framework
(MOF), UiO-66, as a physical and chemical barrier for soluble polysulfides
to functionalize the commercial polypropylene separator. The Li–S
cell assembled with such a separator shows a significantly improved
cycling stability with an average specific capacity of ca. 720 mA
h g–1 at a current rate of 0.5 C for 500 cycles.
Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the cell
performance enhancement results from the physical restriction of the
MOF barrier layer and strong chemical interaction between UiO-66 and
polysulfides. The excellent thermal stability and chemical robustness
(in acid/alkali solutions, conventional organic solvents, and polysulfide
electrolytes) of UiO-66 make it highly competitive among various materials
developed for separator modification in Li–S batteries.

1 Introduction
The
lithium–sulfur battery has been considered as one of
the most promising battery technologies because of its high energy
density and the low-cost and high abundant sulfur element.1,2 However, there are still some crucial challenges toward the practical
application of lithium–sulfur batteries, such as the shuttle
effect of highly soluble polysulfide intermediates, which leads to
internal short circuit inside the cell.3−6 Many strategies have been proposed to alleviate
the shuttle effect, for example, physical and/or chemical confinement
of the soluble polysulfide intermediates in the cathode.7−14 Alternatively, functionalizing the cell separator with an additional
barrier layer also provides a straightforward approach.15−21 In consideration of the compatibility of lithium–sulfur batteries
with the existing battery technologies, it is preferred to use components
well-developed for lithium-ion batteries such as the commercialized
polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene separators. Such separators are
advantageous in cost, mechanical strength, chemical stability, and
electrochemical stability. However, they are incapable of restraining
polysulfide diffusion. Accordingly, some functional materials are
implanted on the commercialized separators as the blocking interlayer
to prevent polysulfide migration from the cathode to the anode while
maintaining the capability of ion conductivity.22−24

Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous crystalline
materials composed of metal ions (or clusters) linked by organic ligands.25−27 Because of their large surface areas, regular pore sizes, and tailorable
chemistry, MOF materials have shown great promise for a variety of
applications.28−34 Given their uniform (sub-) nanometer-sized pore structures, MOFs
would be promising candidate materials to construct separators capable
of alleviating the shuttle effect.35−40 Three strategies have been developed for the preparation of MOF-based/-derived
cell separators. For example, He et al. used HKUST-1 nanoparticles
as assembly units and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)–hexafluoropropylene
as a binder to prepare the separator,41 which served as a good physical barrier to confine the polysulfide
intermediates in the cathode side and led to a stable Li plating/stripping
even at high current densities. He et al. reported the in situ growth
of ZIF-67 and its conversion into hollow Co9S8 arrays on a PP separator,42 which functioned
as an efficient polysulfide barrier for high-performance lithium–sulfur
batteries. Wu et al. directly casted ZIF-8/carbon nanotube/PVDF slurry
onto one side of a PP separator and improved significantly the reversible
capacity and cycling stability of lithium–sulfur batteries.43 Until now, however, little attention has been
paid on the stability of MOFs on exposure to the electrolyte environment.
In fact, the mismatched standard redox potentials of the transition
metals in MOFs and polysulfides/lithium might raise the risk of structure
collapse of the framework materials.44

In addition, most investigated MOFs are very sensitive to moisture
or the acidity of the electrolyte, which adds on additional restriction
to the electrolyte choice.45 Therefore,
it is crucial to search for proper MOF materials that can effectively
alleviate the shuttle effect through physical and/or chemical interactions
at the molecular level while maintaining good structural stability.46,47 Herein, we report the UiO-66-modified PP separator that enables
a significant improvement in cyclability of lithium–sulfur
batteries. The UiO–PP separator was prepared by casting the
slurry composed of MOF crystals, Super P carbon, and PVDF in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
on a commercial PP separator. Electrochemical performance study indicates
that the UiO–PP separator can significantly improve the cycling
stability of the assembled cells over the conventional PP separator,
with an average specific capacity of ca. 720 mA h g–1 at a current rate of 0.5 C for 500 cycles. Experimental results
and first-principle calculations suggest that the chemical adsorption
of polysulfides on UiO-66 frameworks combined with the physical restriction
effect of the UiO–PP separator greatly facilitates the alleviation
of shuttle effect and thus contributes to lithium–sulfur cells
with improved stability and cyclability.

2 Results
and Discussion
UiO-66 crystals were synthesized via the base/acid
comodulated
method.49 This controlled synthesis strategy
allows for the large-scale production of UiO-66 octahedral microcrystals
with the uniform but tunable sizes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
indicated that the as-synthesized product was crystalline and displayed
a diffraction pattern (Figure 1a) that is identical to that of UiO-66.48 The crystal structure was built with hexanuclear Zr6-octahedron
clusters connected by terephthalic acid, featuring regular octahedral
cages (11 Å) and tetrahedral ones (9 Å) connected by the
0.6 nm triangular window. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 1b) revealed that
the product consisted of octahedral crystals with an average size
of ca. 400 nm and a relatively narrow size distribution. Energy-dispersive
X-ray microanalysis confirmed the existence of C, O, and Zr and residual
dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules in the as-prepared UiO-66 crystals.50 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried
out to evaluate the thermal stability of the as-prepared UiO-66 sample.
The TGA traces showed weight losses in the temperature ranges of 25–230,
230–390, and 390–550 °C, corresponding to the weight
loss from volatilization of solvent molecules, the dehydroxylation
and elimination of monodentate modulators, and the decomposition of
1,4-benzenedicarboxylic linkers, respectively (Figure 1c).48,51 The porosity was investigated
by N2-sorption measurement at 77 K. As shown in Figure 1d, the evacuated
UiO-66 sample exhibited the type I isotherms with a rapid increase
in N2 uptake at low relative pressure (<0.01), suggesting
the microporous structure. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area was calculated as 1284.2 m2 g–1. The pore size distribution analysis indicated that the most populated
pore widths were centered at 0.91 and 1.09 nm, which correspond to
the regular tetrahedral and octahedron cages in UiO-66, respectively.48

The UiO–PP separator was
prepared by mixing UiO-66 crystals
with a conductive carbon and PVDF binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) and by casting the resultant homogeneous slurry onto a Celgard
2500 membrane. SEM investigation (Figures 2a and S1, Supporting Information) indicated that the MOF-containing layer on the
PP membrane had a uniform thickness of ca. 20 μm and the UiO-66
crystals and carbon additive were distributed homogeneously in the
layer. To probe the effectiveness of the MOF–PP separator for
suppressing the diffusion of polysulfides, a glass vial was loaded
with a crimson polysulfide electrolyte solution and installed with
a cap with an open hole (Ø 4 mm) that was sealed
with a piece of UiO–PP or PP separator. After the bottle was
upturned into the blank electrolyte, the polysulfide diffusion across
the UiO–PP or PP separators was visually investigated. As shown
in Figure 2b, no obvious
polysulfide diffusion into the blank electrolyte was observed for
the MOF–PP separator within 24 h. In contrast, polysulfides
diffused quickly through the PP separator and discolored the blank
within 12 h. This result proved preliminarily that the modification
of the PP separator with UiO-66 can restrain effectively the polysulfide
diffusion.

(b) Diffusion of the polysulfides in the visualized bottle using UiO–PP
and PP separators. (c) Nyquist plots (upper) and corresponding equivalent
circuit (lower) of a Li–S cell using UiO–PP and PP separators.

To verify whether such a capability
brought down the Li+-ion conductivity across the separator
in a Li–S cell, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the internal resistance
of a CR2032 coin cell consisting of 1 M LiTFSI in 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane
(DME) as the electrolyte, S/Super P carbon as the cathode, Li metal
as the anode, and UiO–PP or PP as the separator. The Nyquist
plots and Nyquist equivalent circuit are shown in Figure 2c. In the equivalent circuit, Re, Rct, and Rf stand for the Ohmic resistances of the electrolyte,
charge transfer, and the film electrode, respectively. CPEct and CPEf represent the constant-phase element. Zw is the Warburg impedance of the process of
Li+ ions diffusing into the electrolyte. Both cells exhibited
the similar Ohmic resistances of the electrolyte (6.2 Ω for
the UiO–PP separator and 6.9 Ω for the PP separator,
respectively). It is known that the soluble polysulfides can shuttle
back and forth freely through the channels of the PP separator, causing
the shuttle effect in a Li–S cell. However, for the UiO–PP
separator, these channels were blocked, benefitting to suppress the
migration of polysulfides to the Li anode. Therefore, the cell with
a UiO–PP separator exhibited lower charge transfer (27.1 Ω)
and film electrode resistances (15.2 Ω) than the PP separator
counterpart (31.8 and 38.4 Ω, respectively). Besides, the open-circuit
voltages of Li–S cells using the UiO–PP separator exhibited
an antiself-discharge feature as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). It was observed that the open-circuit
voltage of a normal cell only with a PP separator remained at ca.
2.35 V versus Li+/Li with gradual decay in the measured
180 h, which indicates an immediate spontaneous reduction of sulfur
into high-order polysulfides. Whereas this self-discharging was inhibited
by the incorporation of the UiO–PP separator, of which the
open-circuit voltage remained stable at ca. 2.7 V versus Li+/Li for more than 150 h because of the prohibition of soluble sulfur
emigration into the anode. Nevertheless, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests
with different sweep rates (Figure S3, Supporting Information) indicated that the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient
(Table S1, Supporting Information) was
decreased by the introduction of a UiO interlayer.

The electrochemical
performance of the UiO–PP separator
was investigated and compared with that of the bare PP separator and
that modified with SiO2 nanoparticles (denoted as SiO2–PP). Previous studies have demonstrated that the PP
separators with and without SiO2 nanoparticle modification
showed the similar stable electrochemical window and SiO2 nanoparticles could function as a physical barrier to alleviate
polysulfide migration across the separator.52Figure 3a shows the
CV profiles of the Li–S cells with UiO–PP, SiO2–PP, and PP as separators. All three cells showed typical
reduction/oxidation reactions of elemental sulfur with two cathodic
peaks in the potential range of 1.8–2.1 and 2.1–2.4
V (vs Li+/Li) and an anodic peak in the potential range
of 2.4–2.7 V. The two cathodic peaks corresponded to the reduction
of S8 to soluble polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sx, 4 ≤ x ≤
8) and further to solid Li2S2/Li2S and the anodic peak was related to the conversion of Li2S2/Li2S back to Li2Sx and S8.53,54 Compared with
that using a PP separator, the cells with UiO–PP and SiO2–PP separators exhibited smaller polarization upon
charging because of the improved electric conductivity caused by a
conductive carbon additive in the barrier layer. Galvanostatic charge/discharge
test (Figure 3b) showed
that all cells exhibited one major plateau in charge processes and
two major plateaus in discharge processes, consistent with one major
anodic peak and two major cathodic peaks observed in CV profiles.
The discharge capacity in the cell using the UiO–PP separator
reached 1032 mA h g–1 at a current rate of 0.5 C
(1 C = 1675 mA g–1), which was greater than those
in the cells using SiO2–PP and PP separators (921
and 737 mA h g–1, respectively). In addition, the
cells using the UiO–PP separator showed less overpotential
compared with the other two. It is noteworthy that the cell with the
SiO2–PP separator showed the increased discharge
capacity and decreased overpotential compared with that using the
PP separator, indicating certain capability of the SiO2 nanoparticle layer to alleviate the shuttle effect. Nevertheless,
it is obvious that the UiO-66 barrier layer exhibits a more effective
suppression of polysulfide migration to the anode side than that of
SiO2.

(c) Galvanostatic specific charge/discharge capacity (Cs) and corresponding Coulombic efficiency (ηCE) of the Li–S cells. (d) Rate performance and corresponding

and black are assigned to the cells using UiO–PP, SiO2–PP, and PP as separators, respectively.

The stability test of the Li–S cells was evaluated
at a
0.5 C rate and shown in Figure 3c. All three cells showed a Coulombic efficiency of ca. 100%,
which should result from the passivation of the Li anode by LiNO3.55 Capacities at the end of the
500th cycle were observed as 586, 357, and 320 mA h g–1 and the corresponding average capacity retentions per cycle were
calculated as 99.85, 99.75, and 99.78% for the cells using UiO–PP,
SiO2–PP, and PP separators, respectively, indicating
the higher cycling stability of the former. With higher sulfur loading
and sulfur weight ratio in the electrode, the UiO–PP separator
also exhibited better cycling stability and higher specific capacity
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). XRD
patterns recorded on the UiO–PP separator after cycling test
demonstrated no obvious crystal structure (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Further examination
on the UiO–PP separator that was stored in ambient condition
for 3 days after cycling also suggested a well-maintained crystal
structure of UiO-66. Besides, compared with the PP separator, the
UiO–PP separator featured greatly decreased deposition of insoluble
polysulfides and fluffy Li dendrites on the anode surface (Figure
S6, Supporting Information), demonstrating
in turn its ability in internal shuttle suppression and Li anode protection.
The rate capability was evaluated by cycling the cells at different
C-rates (Figure 3d).
The average capacities at C-rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C were
1120/937/848, 1016/781/745, 855/671/540, 645/618/326, and 461/514/191
mA h g–1 for the cells with UiO–PP, SiO2–PP, and PP separators, respectively. No doubt the
cell with the PP separator showed the lowest capacity at all C-rates
because of the uncontrolled shuttle effect. The cell with the UiO–PP
separator exhibited higher capacity than that with the SiO2–PP separator at moderate C-rates (≤0.5 C), whereas
they displayed the similar capacity at higher C-rates (≥1 C)
as high rates would reduce the retention time of polysulfides within
the electrolyte and thus weaken the shuttle effect.56 Compared with previously reported MOF-modified separators
(Table 1), the UiO–PP
separator should be competitive for the Li–S cell application
with regard to the cycle life of cells and chemical stability of barrier
materials.

Density functional theory (DFT) simulation
was performed to gain
further insights into the roles of UiO-66 in alleviating effectively
the shuttle effect in Li–S cells. According to previous investigations,59 the S–S chain length in polysulfides
(Li2Sn, 4 < n < 8) was in the range of 2.09 and 2.39 Å, and the Li–S
bond length was approximately 2.6 Å. The lengths were all smaller
than the pore size of UiO-66, indicating that Li2Sn could penetrate into the pores and interact
with the inner walls of the pores. As a result, the pore size would
be reduced to prevent further penetration of polysulfides across the
pores. Figure 4a shows
the optimized geometries of atomic model configurations between the
UiO-66 framework and polysulfides. The intercalations were quantitatively
illustrated by the adsorption energy calculation and reflected the
immobilizing ability of polysulfides on the UiO-66 framework. The
calculated adsorption energy was less than −2 eV for all the
polysulfides except for S8 (Figure 4b) and was also less than those previously
reported on materials derived from other MOFs,60 indicating a strong chemical adsorption of polysulfides
on the UiO-66 framework. Such a chemical adsorption should result
from the strong binding ability between Li+ ions and O
atoms of the ligands61 and between the
S and H atoms of the UiO-66 framework. We further used molecular surface
ESP to verify the origin of the chemical absorption. The O atoms in
the UiO-66 framework exhibited strong negative charge, whereas the
Li+ ions in polysulfides exhibited strong positive charge
(Figure 4c), which
would lead to strong Coulomb attraction between Li+ ions
and O atoms. Because of strong electrostatic attraction between Li+ ions and Sn2–, the polysulfides could be immobilized on the UiO-66 framework by
Coulombic attraction. Such a chemical adsorption was observed through
a visualized static adsorption test by dispersing UiO-66 crystals
in the polysulfide solution (Figure S6, Supporting Information). After soaking the UiO-66 crystals in a polysulfide
solution for 24 h, the color of the solution changed from yellowish
brown to colorless, and the color of UiO-66 crystals changed from
white to bright yellow, indicating that most polysulfides were captured
by UiO-66 crystals. The chemical intercalation between UiO-66 crystals
and polysulfides was further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Three contributions of O were found in the pristine UiO-66
crystals, which are assigned to the Zr–O, C=O, and H–O
bonds, respectively (Figure S7, Supporting Information). After chemisorption, another contribution of O emerged at a binding
energy of ca. 531 eV, which corresponds to the binding energy of Li–O
bonds.62 It could be concluded that the
doped Li+ ions did interact with the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic
acid ligand (i.e., exchange the carboxylate protons) and form lithium
alkoxide (i.e., lithium carboxylate group). Besides, S atoms with
weak negative charges might also interact with the positively charged
surface of the UiO-66 framework to further intensify the chemical
adsorption. On the basis of the above analysis, the chemical adsorption
of polysulfides on UiO-66 frameworks combined with the physical restriction
effect of the UiO–PP separator greatly suppressed the shuttle
effect and thus contributed to the improved stability and cyclability
of Li–S cells.

3 Conclusions
In summary, uniform UiO-66 crystals
with narrow size distribution
have been synthesized via solvothermal reaction. Because of its regular
pore sizes and strong interaction with soluble polysulfides, UiO-66
can serve as both physical and chemical barrier materials for soluble
polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect in Li–S batteries.
The Li–S cell assembled using a UiO–PP separator exhibits
a long cycle life with a specific capacity of 586 mA h g–1 after 500 charge/discharge cycles at a current rate of 0.5 C and
the nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency during the cycling, disclosing
that the MOF–PP separator can prevent effectively the soluble
polysulfides from migrating toward the Li anode while having negligible
influence on lithium-ion transference. Moreover, the high thermal
stability and excellent robustness against polysulfides, moisture,
and oxygen make UiO-66 a highly promising candidate material for functionalizing
the commercialized separators for Li–S battery applications.
This work will also draw the attention toward the development of separators
for energy storage devices with emphasis on the stability and efficiency.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of UiO-66
1,4-Benzenedicarboxylic
acid (0.60 mmol, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and triethylamine (0.60 mmol,
98%, J&K Chemicals) were charged into a round-bottle flask containing N,N-DMF (140 mL, 99.5%, J&K Chemicals).
After the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, acetic
acid (360 mmol, 99.5%, J&K Chemicals) was slowly added. The solution
was heated to 120 °C in an oil bath and maintained at this temperature
for 1 h. ZrCl4 (10 mL; 99.5%, Acros) solution in DMF (60
mM) was added, and the mixed solution was allowed to react at 120
°C for 6 h without stirring. After the solution was cooled to
room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation, washed
several times with DMF and methanol, and soaked in methanol for 3
days.

4.2 Preparation of the UiO-66-Modified PP Separator
(UiO–PP)
The as-prepared UiO-66 crystals, Super P
carbon (Timcal), and PVDF (Fisher Scientific) with a weight ratio
of 7:2:1 were added into NMP (anhydrous, Fisher Scientific) and thoroughly
mixed in a dispensing system (ARE310, Thinky Corp.) at 2000 rpm for
20 min. The slurry was directly coated on one side of a commercial
Celgard 2500 membrane using a doctor blade. The modified membrane
was dried in a vacuum oven at 55 °C for 24 h and punched into
a circular separator (Ø 19 mm). The typical
loading amount was around 0.35 mg cm–2. For the
preparation of the SiO2 nanoparticle-modified PP separator,
the equal weight ratio of the SiO2 nanoparticle was used
instead of UiO-66 crystals in preparation of the slurry while other
procedures were kept unchanged. To prepare SiO2 nanoparticles,
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 2.08 mL, 95%, J&K Chemicals) was
added to ethanol (50 mL, 95%, Sino Reagent) to form the precursor
solution. Another solution composed of deionized water (3 mL), ammonia
hydroxide (3.85 mL, 28 wt %, Sino Reagent), and ethanol (40 mL) was
slowly added into the precursor solution and reacted at room temperature
for 20 h with stirring. The product was collected by centrifugation,
washed several times with ethanol and deionized water, and finally
redispersed in ethanol. The as-prepared SiO2 nanoparticles
were spheres with a diameter of ca. 400 nm and narrow size distribution.

4.3 Electrode Preparation and Cell Assembly
To prepare the sulfur electrodes, elemental sulfur (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich),
Super P carbon, and PVDF binder in NMP (5% weight ratio) were thoroughly
mixed with a weight ratio of 65:30:5 in a dispensing system. The resultant
slurry was cast onto an aluminum foil with a thickness of 100 μm
using a doctor blade method. The thickness of the slurry was about
100 μm. The sulfur electrodes were dried in vacuum at 65 °C
for 10 h and then cut into circular pellets (Ø 10 mm). The typical sulfur loading for each electrode was 1.5 mg·cm–2. The cell was assembled in an argon-filled glovebox
(H2O and O2 concentration <1 ppm) using a
standard CR2032 coin cell. The cell used the sulfur electrode as the
cathode, metallic lithium as the anode (Ø 12
mm), UiO–PP as the separator, and 1.0 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
lithium salt (LiTFSI, battery grade, Sigma-Aldrich) in DOL (anhydrous,
Sigma-Aldrich)/DME (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) as the electrolyte (15
μL), respectively. The volume ratio of DOL/DME was 1:1 in the
electrolyte solution to which a small amount of LiNO3 (1%
weight ratio, anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich) was added.

4.4 Calculation Method
The structure
optimization was performed using Gaussian 09 software package with
full electron basis set sto-3g63−67 in the vacuum, and some atoms of UiO-66 had been frozen in order
to keep the symmetry and periodicity of the structure. The basic unit
of UiO-66 was selected to calculate the adsorption energy considering
the periodicity. The adsorption energy calculation was conducted according
to the equation Eabs = Etot – (E1 + E2), where Eabs is
the absorption energy between UiO-66 and polysulfide species Li2Sn (n = 1, 2,
4, 6, 8), Etot is the total energy of
UiO-66 with Li2Sn, and E1 and E2 are the
energies of UiO-66 and Li2Sn, respectively.

4.5 Characterizations
Powder XRD patterns
were recorded using a Philips X’per PRDMPD diffractometer with
nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). SEM
images were taken by a Zeiss supra 55 field-emission SEM with an accelerating
voltage of 8 kV. Nitrogen-sorption studies were performed at 77 K
up to 1 bar with an ASAP 2020 HD88 (Micromeritics). Before the sorption
measurements, the samples were activated under 150 °C for 24
h. TGA was carried out using a simultaneous thermal analyzer apparatus
(DSC1, METTLER TOLEDO) at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under air atmosphere. XPS measurement was performed on a Thermo
ESCALAB 250XI system in vacuum (<10–9 Pa) with
Al Kα source at 15 kV and 12 mA. Galvanostatic experiments were
performed on a battery testing system (BT-2043, Arbin Instruments)
in a potential range of 1.5–3 V (vs Li+/Li). The
CV and EIS measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation
(CHI760D, Chenhua Instrument) at a sweeping rate of 0.2 mV s–1 and a frequency range of 10–105 Hz, respectively.
