Mechanically adaptive materials that
soften upon exposure to physiological
conditions are useful for biomedical applications, notably as substrates
for implantable neural electrodes. So far, device fabrication efforts
have largely relied on shaping such devices by laser cutting, but
this process makes it difficult to produce complex electrode architectures
and leads to ill-defined surface chemistries. Here, we report mechanically
adaptive, physiologically responsive polymers that can be photopolymerized
and thus patterned via soft lithography and photolithography. The
adaptive polymer networks produced exhibit, in optimized compositions,
a ca. 500-fold decrease of their storage modulus when exposed to simulated
physiological conditions, for example, from 2.5 GPa to 5 MPa. This
effect is caused by modest swelling (30% w/w), which in turn leads
to plasticization so that the polymer network’s glass transition
temperature is reduced from 145 to 25 °C. The polymer networks
can further be rendered pH-responsive by the incorporation of methacrylic
acid. The dual stimuli-responsive materials thus made show promise
as coatings or substrates for drug delivery devices.

Introduction
Mechanically adaptive
polymers, which modify their mechanical properties
in response to a specific trigger, constitute a subset of the ever-growing
class of stimuli-responsive materials.1 They include polymers that soften upon exposure to physiological
conditions, which are considered useful for biomedical applications,
notably as substrates for implantable neural electrodes.2−4 Such electrodes are part of artificial brain–machine interfaces,
but the mechanical mismatch between the currently tested rigid electrodes
and the much softer cortical tissue appears to be one factor that
limits their in vivo lifetime.2,5,6 Mechanically adaptive materials have been shown to overcome this
problem as they allow the fabrication of devices that are initially
rigid and robust and can be readily implanted into the soft tissue
and then soften and therefore minimize the mechanical mismatch relative
to the tissue.2−4 Indeed, studies have shown that implants based on
such materials elicit reduced chronical tissue responses, even if
the modulus of the adaptive material in the soft state was still 3
orders of magnitude higher than that of the cortical tissue.5−8

Sea cucumber-inspired nanocomposites composed of various polymer
matrices and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have previously been shown
to soften when placed in living tissue, emulated physiological conditions
(artificial cerebrospinal fluid, ACSF, at 37 °C), or simply water.9−15 The mechanical contrast displayed by such materials upon swelling
depends on the nature of the polymer matrix and the type of cellulose
nanocrystals, but typical stiff states are characterized by a storage
modulus (E′) of 4.0–13.7 GPa in the
dry state, whereas the ACSF-swollen materials display E′ values of 5–160 MPa (at 37 °C).9,16,17 The largest water-induced modulus
change was demonstrated for materials in which water take-up causes
plasticization of the polymer matrix such that the glass transition
temperature (Tg) of the material is lowered
from above to below the body temperature.9,17 In
addition, the hydrogen-bonded percolating CNC network that reinforces
the polymer matrix in the dry state is weakened or disassembled upon
the interaction of the CNCs with water that amplifies the softening.9,18 Another approach based on photopolymerizable (meth)acrylate and
thiol-ene shape-memory polymers with glass transition temperatures
in the range of 40–60 °C has also been investigated.19−21 The thermally- and water-responsive thiol-ene-based shape-memory
polymers studied exhibited reduction of their Young’s moduli E from ca. 1–2 GPa to ca. 15–50 MPa upon immersion
in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at 37 °C, on account
of the temperature increase and minute swelling (ca. 3–6% w/w).20−22 Mechanically adaptive neural electrodes were subsequently fabricated
by a transfer-by-polymerization process. In a first step, a gold electrode
was patterned on a sacrificial layer using electron-beam lithography.
The thiol-ene-based resin was then poured between the patterned gold
electrode and a glass slide and photopolymerized, using the gold pattern
as a mold. After the removal of the sacrificial layer and addition
of a patterned isolating layer on the electrode, the final device
was cut from the laminated structure via laser ablation. Laser cutting,
which represents a low-cost and well-established technique for microdevice
fabrication,23 was also used to process
the above nanocomposites. However, the inherent thermal degradation
of the substrate and the limitations with respect to feature size
and complex three-dimensional (3D) structures may limit its applicability
in the context of neural electrode fabrication beyond proof-of-concept
studies.3,21,24,25 Thus, the desire to increase the complexity and reduce
the size of electrode architectures constitutes a challenge not only
from a material perspective but also for the microfabrication process.26−29

Photolithography, another well-established technique for miniaturized
device fabrication, does not suffer from the same limitations as laser
cutting. Two-dimensional (2D) and, under certain conditions, three-dimensional
(3D) features with resolution down to the sub-50 nm scale can be achieved,30−32 thus rendering the technique particularly attractive in the context
of bioelectronics and neuroprosthetics.33,34 A mechanically
adaptive polymeric system suitable for photolithographic processing
would simplify the device fabrication process and thus broaden the
scope of potential applications but also require a (significant) revision
of the material design.34,35 Thus, as a stepping
stone toward photolithographically processable, mechanically adaptive
neural electrodes, we herein report the development of a photopolymerizable
methacrylate-based polymer substrate that exhibits water-induced softening.
While photopolymerizable (meth)acrylates, in particular, based on
solution-polymerized 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), have been
widely studied as cross-linked stimuli-responsive hydrogels for biomedical
applications,36−41 the water-responsive, mechanically adaptive characteristics of bulk-polymerized
HEMA-based networks have remained largely unexplored.42 We show that straightforward tailoring of the response
and of the properties of the material is possible by simple compositional
changes and that these materials can be patterned using soft- or photolithography,
thus making it attractive as substrate for implantable neural electrodes.
Other potential applications of such materials include microneedles.
Current designs of polymer-based microneedles usually decouple the
insertion capacity from the drug delivery function,43 by blending, for example, a stiff polymer with a drug-loaded
hydrogel,44 or by incorporating the drug
in a stiff, water-soluble polymer.45 The
materials studied here would allow the photolithographic fabrication
of smart microneedles, which would be stiff enough to penetrate the
skin and could then, upon (tunable) swelling, release their cargo
in a controlled manner inside the body. The range of applications
for which the materials might be useful was further expanded by rendering
them pH-responsive through the incorporation of methacrylic acid,
which we expected to be mainly protonated or deprotonated in a biologically
relevant pH range.46 pH-Responsive hydrogels
are of interest for drug delivery applications,46−50 for example, in oral drug delivery systems that experience
a pH increase from 1.0 to 6.6 as they travel through the acidic stomach
to the intestine or colon where they release their content.51,52

Results and Discussion
(Co)polymer networks based on 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (HEMA)
and optionally methacrylic acid (MAA) were prepared via a photoinitiated
solvent-free polymerization procedure using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate
(EGDMA) as cross-linker (Scheme 1). The composition was systematically varied with the
objective to maximize the stiffness in the dry state and minimize
the stiffness in the water-swollen state at minimum water uptake.
A soft lithography approach was used to produce samples of a shape
suitable for mechanical analysis, i.e., rectangular samples that were
12 mm long, 5 mm wide, and ca. 250 μm thick. Thus, in a first
series, HEMA was photopolymerized in the presence of 8, 12, or 16
mol % of EGDMA (in the absence of MAA) in a silicone mold to afford
p(HEMAx-co-EGDMAz). In a second series, HEMA (60–90 mol
%) and MAA (10–40 mol %) were photo-copolymerized in the presence
of 8 mol % of EGDMA in a silicone mold to give p(HEMAx-co-MAAy-co-EGDMAz). The subscripts x, y, and z represent
the mol % of each monomer in the feed. The monomer mixtures were polymerized
by irradiation with UV light (365 nm, 200 W/m2, 150 s),
followed by an overnight postexposure bake at 80 °C in an oven.
Residual monomers and other extractables were removed by immersion
in an ethanol/isopropanol mixture (1:1 v/v). After a final drying
step at 80 °C under vacuum, the samples were stored in a dry
box to avoid any moisture uptake.

The cross-linked p(HEMA) networks were assumed
to display mechanical
switching as a consequence of plasticization by water, expecting that
this effect would cause the glass transition temperature (Tg) to drop from above to below physiological
temperature (37 °C).53 The softening
is therefore intimately related to the swelling behavior and to the
thermomechanical properties, i.e., the Tg of the polymer networks in both the dry and water-swollen state.
Thus, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was carried out to characterize
the mechanically adaptive polymer networks. In a first step, the thermomechanical
properties of the dry p(HEMA) networks were investigated (Figure 1a and Table 1). We first discuss the storage
modulus E′ in the glassy state (determined
at 25 °C), the Tg, and E′ in the rubbery regime (determined at 195 °C), as quantities
that are relevant for the switching process. The dynamic mechanical
analysis traces of dry samples of the p(HEMA) series show storage
moduli E′ between 2.0 and 2.5 GPa in the glassy
regime. Their stiffness is thus somewhat lower than that of the mechanically
adaptive nanocomposites reported before,9,16,17 but similar to that of shape-memory polymer systems
considered for cortical implants.20−22 In the rubbery plateau, E′ values between 5 and 28 MPa were measured. These
values reflect the different cross-link densities of the polymer networks
and provide some indication as to the modulus range that might be
achievable in the case of plasticization-induced softening. Indeed,
Flory and Rehner demonstrated that in the case of a large extent of
swelling, the modulus of a swollen rubber is inversely proportional
to the swelling and should therefore be lower than the dry rubber’s
modulus.54 Here, the modulus of the water-swollen
p(HEMA) networks is slightly higher than that of the dry materials
above Tg, possibly due to the formation
of nonpermanent cross-links, as p(HEMA) and water molecules are known
to interact strongly via hydrogen bonding.55 Furthermore, the Tg, determined from
the maximum of the loss tangent curves, was found to slightly increase
with the cross-link density from 145 to 159 °C. These rather
high Tg values indicate that significant
plasticization, i.e., swelling, will be required to reduce the transition
to below the body temperature.

prior to measurement.

To simulate
the conditions experienced by implants in vivo, the
p(HEMA) networks were swollen in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)
at the body temperature (37 °C) for 24 h.56,57 The results of kinetic swelling experiments with p(HEMA100-co-EGDMA8) (Figure S3) reflect that under these conditions equilibrium swelling
has been reached. Figure 1b shows that the swelling is governed by the hydrophilic nature
of HEMA on the one hand and the extent of cross-linking on the other.
The swelling of the p(HEMA-co-EGDMA) networks in
ACSF at 37 °C could be tuned between 32% w/w (8 mol % cross-linker)
and 18% w/w (16 mol % cross-linker). Higher or lower swelling values
could be achieved by expanding the concentration range of the cross-linker,
as reported elsewhere.58,59 As the preparation method of
hydrogels is known to influence the structure and properties of the
materials,60,61 we emphasize that the materials
explored here were prepared via bulk polymerization, in contrast to
the vast majority of solution-polymerized HEMA hydrogels previously
reported. The mechanical response of p(HEMA-co-EGDMA)
networks under simulated physiological conditions was determined by
conducting DMA experiments in submersion mode in ACSF, after conditioning
the samples in ACSF at 37 °C for 24 h. The experimentally accessible
temperature range was 5–75 °C. The submersion DMA traces
show glass transitions of 25–53 °C. Gratifyingly, the E′ values in the rubbery regime are comparable to
those measured for the dry materials well above the Tg (Figure 1a,c and Table 1),
supporting the conclusion that the softening is largely due to a shift
of the Tg on account of plasticization.
At body temperature (37 °C), E′ values
of 7, 98, and 342 MPa were measured for the p(HEMA) networks with
cross-link densities of 8, 12, and 16 mol %, respectively (Figure 1c). The material
with the lowest cross-link density, p(HEMA100-co-EGDMA8), has the lowest Tg of the series and is in the rubbery regime at 37 °C, in contrast
to the copolymers with 12 and 16 mol % of cross-linker, where the
glass transition occurs at higher temperatures. To eliminate the possibility
that the softening is the result of specific interactions that involve
ACSF components, measurements for p(HEMA100-co-EGDMA8) were also carried out in water, but no significant
difference was observed (Figure S1). Thus,
the data shown in Figure 1 unambiguously link the magnitude of the mechanical contrast
to the extent of swelling (i.e., water plasticization), which in turn
is controlled by the cross-link density. From the three compositions
studied, p(HEMA100-co-EGDMA8) exhibits the largest mechanical contrast between the dry and the
swollen state, while displaying a swelling behavior that is comparable
to that of the adaptive CNC nanocomposites previously reported by
our group.9,16,17 p(HEMA100-co-EGDMA8) is the only studied
material that in the ACSF-swollen state displays a Tg below the body temperature, and thus displays by far
the largest mechanical switching (modulus drop of >2 orders of
magnitude)
capacity at 37 °C (Figure 1c).

The second material series involved copolymerizing
HEMA (60–90
mol %), MAA (10–40 mol %), and EGDMA (8 mol %) with the aim
of producing polymer networks exhibiting both pH-responsive characteristics
and the ability to change their mechanical properties, which would
be useful for drug delivery devices. The general shapes of the dynamic
mechanical analysis traces of dry samples of the p(HEMA-co-MAA) series mirror those of the MAA-free polymers, revealing a glassy
regime with a storage modulus E′ of 2.4–2.5
GPa and a rubbery plateau above the Tg (Figure 2a and Table 2). The Tg was found to increase from 150 to 180 °C with increasing
MAA content, on account of the higher Tg displayed by p(MAA). The pH-responsive character of the p(HEMA-co-MAA-co-EGDMA) networks was evaluated
by immersing the samples at 37 °C in different buffers, having
pH values of 3, 5, or 7 and molarity of 40 mM. The extent of swelling
was measured, and the mechanical properties of the samples thus conditioned
were studied by submersion-mode DMA in the same buffer. As expected,
the swelling of the p(HEMA-co-MAA-co-EGDMA) copolymer networks is strongly pH-dependent (Figure 2b and Table 2). At pH 3 and 5, where the MAA is protonated,
the swelling ranges from 23 to 28%, independent of the MAA content,
and the extent of swelling is comparable to that of p(HEMA100-co-EGDMA8) (Table 1). At neutral pH, the deprotonation of the
carboxylic acid groups of the MAA units increases the hydrophilicity
and consequently the extent of swelling to 58–102% w/w, i.e.,
the pH change from 3 to 7 triggers a 4-fold increase of the swelling
for the materials with 40 and 25 mol % of MAA and a 2-fold increase
for that with 10 mol % of MAA.

a Swelling data in
pH buffer (3, 5,
and 7) at 37 °C, and thermomechanical properties of the pH-buffer-swollen
samples. All data are based on DMA experiments.

For the p(HEMA-co-MAA-co-EGDMA)
copolymer networks, we also conducted isothermal DMA experiments at
37 °C in submersion mode at pH 3, 5, and 7 (Figure 2c). Prior to measurement, all
samples were conditioned by immersion in pH buffers for 24 h. An inspection
of the data shows that also in the case of this series, the magnitude
of the softening is related to the dry Tg and the extent of swelling. At pH 3 and 5, all samples show comparable
swelling (22–28%) but exhibit distinct softening behaviors.
While p(HEMA90-co-MAA10-co-EGDMA8) displays E′
values of 29 and 23 MPa at pH 3 and 5, respectively, p(HEMA60-co-MAA40-co-EGDMA8) shows an E′ value an order of magnitude
higher (235 and 177 MPa, respectively). At a similar extent of swelling,
the drop of Tg is expected to be comparable
for the different compositions and the disparities observed are thus
attributed to the different Tg values
of the dry copolymer networks. Indeed, the dry Tg is 30 °C higher for the composition with 40 mol % of
MAA than for the material made with 10 mol % of MAA. The latter is
therefore expected to have a swollen Tg below the body temperature, while p(HEMA60-co-MAA40-co-EGDMA8) remains
above. At pH 7, the considerable increase of swelling drops the Tg of all of the compositions well below the
body temperature and the E′ values measured
at this temperature are in the ∼1–10 MPa range.

With the ultimate goal of fabricating devices of complex shapes,
we explored the feasibility of processing the polymer networks using
a photolithographic process (Figure 3a). For this purpose, the liquid resin used to prepare
p(HEMA100-co-EGDMA8) was placed
between two glass substrates, one of which was equipped with a photomask.
Spacers were used to control the resin thickness to ca. 100 μm.
The resin was cured in a spatially controlled manner by irradiation
with noncollimated UV light through the mask. After irradiation, the
samples were developed by immersion in isopropanol, which removed
the non-cross-linked resin. Initial tests showed significant signs
of cross-linking in the unexposed regions, which appear to be related
to the high photosensitivity of the resin and the simple setup employed.
However, the photosensitivity of the resin to low-intensity stray
light could be reduced by the addition of 0.5% w/w/ of 4-methoxyphenol,
a polymerization inhibitor, to the resin formulation, as reported
by Pardon et al.62 Thus, under irradiation
conditions similar to those employed for the initial formulation (365
nm, 200 W/m2, 30 s), the inhibitor-containing formulation
could be processed into features with a good pattern fidelity in the
100 μm to 10 mm range, namely a difference of about 2.5 μm
on a 145 μm feature (Figures 3b,e and S2a,c). Patterns
with features that were smaller than 10 μm could only be processed
with somewhat limited fidelity. For example, a feature with a width
of about 4 μm (Figures 3f and S2d) showed a 20% reduction
size compared to the photomask (Figures 3d and S2b). It
can be expected that the use of collimated light would further improve
the resolution and thus reduce the achievable feature size. Typical
intracortical electrodes have feature sizes in the 100–1000
μm range,24 and the formulation used
here should be suitable for the photolithographic patterning of the
electrode substrate.

Conclusions
We demonstrated the
mechanically adaptive, physiologically responsive
character of polymer networks based on cross-linked poly(2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate). The p(HEMA) networks exhibit a modulus drop of more
than 2 orders of magnitude when exposed to simulated physiological
conditions. The variation of the cross-link density allowed controlling
the extent of water absorption, which in turn determined the extent
of plasticization and glass transition temperature reduction and thus
led to the observed softening. Gratifyingly, it was possible to design
compositions exhibiting attractive properties in the context of an
application as a substrate for neural electrode, namely a 500-fold
modulus decrease, from 2.5 GPa to 5 MPa at a modest swelling of 30%
w/w.

The stimuli-responsive behavior could be expanded by the
introduction
of methacrylic acid as a comonomer that imparted a pH-responsive behavior
to the material. The pH response, as well as the extent of swelling
and softening, were tuned by adjusting the composition of the copolymer
networks. The relatively high swelling of the HEMA-co-MAA platform at neutral pH and the (herein not evaluated) potential
delamination issues would preclude the use of such materials in neural
electrodes but the development of mechanically adaptive, pH-sensitive
coating/substrates for drug delivery devices can be achieved with
these copolymers.

Importantly, the preparation of polymer networks
in desirable shapes
by soft- or photolithography, which makes them attractive for rapid
prototyping of devices, was demonstrated. While the biocompatibility
of the new materials is yet to be explored, the results presented
here provide a first indication that the platform could be useful
as a substrate for mechanically adaptive neural interfaces.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
Dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA) was performed on a TA Instruments Q800 DMA using a
multifrequency strain analysis (temperature ramp 0–180 or 0–200
°C, 3 °C/min, 10 min equilibration time at 0 °C), with
an amplitude of 15 μm, and a frequency of 1 Hz. Submersion DMA
in artificial cerebrospinal fluid or deionized water was performed
on the same equipment using either a multifrequency strain analysis
temperature ramp (5–75 °C, 3°C/min) or isothermal
conditions at 37 °C with an amplitude of 15 μm and a frequency
of 1 Hz. Before submersion experiments, samples were conditioned by
immersion in ACSF at 37 °C for 24 h. All data extracted from
DMA experiments are averages and standard deviation from triplicate
measurements. DMA curve graphs show representative experiments.

mol %), methacrylic acid (MAA, 0–40% w/w), ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate (EGDMA, 8–16 mol %), and Irgacure 184 (2% w/w)
were mixed in a brown glass vial. The quantities of each component
were calculated to prepare ca. 10 mL of resin. The resin formulation
was purged with nitrogen for 5 min prior to polymerization, poured
into a silicone mold (12 mm long, 5 mm wide, 0.1 mm high), and irradiated
with UV light (200 W/m2, 150 s). The superficial nonreacted
layer was removed with a tissue before curing the samples overnight
in an oven at 80 °C under air. The samples were then immersed
in isopropanol/ethanol 1:1 for at least 8 h and subsequently dried
overnight in a vacuum oven at 40 °C.

Mold-Free Photolithography
2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate
(100 mol %, 49.5 mmol, 6.44 g, 6.00 mL), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate
(8 mol %, 4.0 mmol, 0.78 g, 0.75 mL), Irgacure 184 (2% w/w, 0.71 mmol,
0.15 g), and (optionally) 4-methoxyphenol (0.5% w/w, 0.29 mmol, 0.04
g) were mixed in a brown glass vial. The resin formulation was purged
with nitrogen for 5 min and was then poured onto a glass slide equipped
with spacers of a thickness of 100 μm. A chrome-on-glass photomask
was placed on top of the assembly. The assembly was then irradiated
with UV light (365 nm, 200 W/m2, 30 s). The photomask was
removed and the non-cross-linked parts were washed away with isopropanol.
The patterned resin was again exposed to UV light (365 nm, 200 W/m2, 120 s) and cured in an oven (80 °C, overnight).

Determination
of the Extent of Swelling
A precisely
weighed amount (10–15 mg) of a dry polymer sample was immersed
in ACSF or in an aqueous buffer (4–5 mL) for 24 h at 37 °C.
The sample was wiped dry with a paper tissue and immediately weighed.
The extent of swelling was calculated using the following formula  where mD is the
dry sample mass and mS is the swollen
sample mass. Values quoted are averages of three samples. Swelling
kinetics was measured over 72 h using the procedure described above.
