As
one of the materials having a bionic structure, nacrelike layered
composites, inspired by their natural hybrid structures, have been
studied via a variety of approaches. Graphene oxide (GO), which differed
from inert graphene, was used as a new building block because it could
be readily chemically functionalized. Rather than natural polymers,
synthetic polymers were most commonly used to fabricate nacrelike
GO–polymer materials. However, naturally occurring polymers
complied more easily with the requirements of biocompatibility, biodegradability,
and nontoxicity. Here, a simple solution-casting method was used to
mimic natural nacre and fabricate a self-assembled and aging-resistant
binary natural polymer, (κ-carrageenan (κ-CAR)–Konjac
glucomannan (KGM))–GO nanocomposites, with varying GO concentrations.
The investigation results revealed that κ-CAR–KGM and
GO mostly self-assemble via the formation of intermolecular hydrogen
bonds to form a well-defined layered structure. The mechanical properties
of the natural polymer–GO films were improved significantly
compared to those of pure natural polymer films. With the addition
of 7.5 wt % GO, the tensile strength (TS) and Young’s modulus
were found to increase by 129.5 and 491.5%, respectively. In addition,
the composite films demonstrated high reliability and aging resistance
as well as a definite TS after cold and hot shock and ozone aging
tests, especially showing a superior ozone resistance. The composite
films can potentially be used as biomaterials or packing materials.

Introduction
Motivated by the in-depth
studies on biological structure, materials
with a bionic structure have recently become a popular topic of materials
research. The shell of Phormosoma placenta, a natural
nacre, is a typical example of this.1 The
excellent mechanical
properties of the shell of P. placenta arise from
their combined advantages of the orderly layered structure and the
abundant area of the interface between the inorganic platelets and
organic matrix.2 Inspired by their natural
hybrid structures and excellent mechanical properties, scientists
have attempted to mimic natural nacre and construct nacrelike layered
composites via a variety of approaches.3 Recently, flattened double-walled carbon nanotubes, Al2O3 platelets, graphene oxide (GO), as well as other materials
have been used as new building blocks with a polymer to provide many
options for the development of new high-performance artificial materials
through the duplication of the orderly layered structure.4 GO was used as a precursor for the production
of chemically modified graphene for the synthesis of new materials.5 Graphene composites have become a hot research
topic because graphene has many advanced characteristics that are
superior to those of all materials, with some reaching theoretically
predicted limits. As graphene is highly inert, GO can be readily chemically
functionalized.6 Recently, it has been
found that the specific penetration energy for multilayer graphene
at a velocity of 600 m/s is ∼10 times higher than that reported
in the literature for macroscopic steel sheets.7 Notably, GO nanosheets can be used as ideal inorganic building
blocks for the assembly of nacrelike materials.8−10 Nacrelike GO–polymer
materials exhibited
excellent mechanical properties. Currently, most scientists use synthetic
rather than natural polymers for assembly with GO.11 However, the raw materials for synthetic polymers, such
as petroleum and coal, are nonrenewable. Therefore, the use of natural
polymers for the synthesis of new materials with a superior performance
is a necessary direction for materials science research.12

Compared with synthetic polymers, naturally
occurring polymers comply more easily with the requirements of biocompatibility,
biodegradability, and nontoxicity.13,14 Carrageenan
(CAR), a marine-derived polymer, is a kind of polysaccharide that
is extracted from red seaweed15 and is
composed of galactose and anhydrogalactose units linked by glycosidic
bonds.16 κ-CAR and i-CAR are two
types of CARs with gel-forming ability. Compared with i-CAR, κ-CAR
gels are more firm, elastic, and soft.17 Furthermore, κ-CAR exhibits good film-forming characteristics.18 Owing to its good pharmacological
and biological activities, κ-CAR is the most widely used commercial
CAR.19 It was found that GO can be functionalized
by CAR. The resulting GO–CAR composite was further used as
a substrate for biomimetic and cell-mediated mineralization of hydroxyapatite.
It has been suggested that the GO–CAR hybrid is a promising
material for bone regeneration and implantation.20 In addition to these advantages, κ-CAR also displays
fatal weaknesses of low viscosity, which makes it difficult to control
the formation of films in solvent evaporates, and poor mechanical
properties for use in κ-CAR composite materials. Konjac glucomannan
(KGM) is another natural polymer that possesses great advantages of
gelling, film-forming ability (hard film), antibacterial action, and
low caloric value.21 Therefore, a kind
of composite polymer of κ-CAR and KGM can be prepared as a promising
component for the construction of ultrastrong materials with GO through
hydrogen-bond interactions due to the abundance of hydroxyl groups
in the polymer chains and GO nanosheet.

Herein, nacrelike GO–polymer
materials were prepared using two low-cost natural polymers, κ-CAR
and KGM, which enhanced their respective advantages and maintained
good pharmacological and biological activities, thereby improving
the film-forming controllability and mechanical properties and expanding
the range of possible uses of composite materials in biomedical applications.
Therefore, films were prepared from binary blends of κ-CAR and
KGM by adding different amounts of GO nanosheets to them. The mechanical
and functional properties of the films were analyzed, and the effects
of cold and hot shock and ozone aging on their structural and functional
properties were discussed to evaluate the reliability of the material
in practical applications.

Results and
Discussion
The obtained κ-CAR–KGM (CK) film
was white and semitransparent (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). CK–GO (CKG), containing GO, formed
a well-defined layered structure (Figure 1d). Upon addition of GO, the film became
dark brown (Figure 1a). SEM images showed that GO was embedded in CK and a higher GO
content led to more intense and larger embedding regions in the layered
structure (Figure 1c,d). In this process, GO nanosheets are combined with CK through
intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Figure 2b). Focusing on the composite areas, we observed that
the surface was not smooth because of the agglomeration of GO sheets
and the agglomeration was not completely contiguous and uniform (Figure 1b). The thicknesses
of the CKG films were measured, and the average was used to calculate
the tensile strength (TS). The result showed that the method used
for film preparation is feasible (Table S3).

The surface morphology and cross
section of the samples
were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface morphology
SEM images of CKG showed GO sheet agglomeration, and it was found
that the agglomeration was not completely contiguous and uniform (Figure 1b). Representative
cross-sectional SEM images of CKG nanocomposites with different GO
concentrations are shown in Figure 1c–d. With an increase in the GO concentration,
the cross section of the CKG nanocomposite films became rough, which
was ascribed to their well-defined layered structure. Additionally,
it was clearly observed that the shear fracture surfaces of the CK–GO-7.5
wt % (CKG7.5) film had typical ductile fracture characteristics (Figure 1d). To determine
the effect of different GO concentrations on the properties of CKG
composite materials, representative SEM images of the tensile fracture
cross section of CKG were obtained and are shown in Figure 1e–i. It can be found
that the mechanism of tensile fracture of CKG was ductile fracture.
A rough fracture surface can be clearly observed, and the tensile
fracture cross section showed a small connecting wire and deformation
traces before the occurrence of the fracture. The most serious structural
damage occurred on CKG7.5 after tensile fracture, which led to almost
total damage of its well-defined layered structure. Moreover, CKG7.5
showed the maximum TS with increasing GO concentration.

The
unique feature of composite materials is their ability to combine
properties that are in contrast to each other. Nacre is an excellent
example of such a composite, obtained using layering. To understand
the chemistry of κ-CAR, KGM, and GO interactions, we characterized
κ-CAR, KGM, the CK composite, and the CKG nanocomposite using
FTIR spectra (Figure 2a,b). Comparison of the spectra of pure κ-CAR,22 pure KGM,23,24 and CK composite films shows
that the following changes occurred in the composite films. The bands
of −OH, the
C–H stretching vibration, and the bending vibrations of saccharide,
C–O, and C6–OH groups were weakened and red-shifted
to 3426, 2927, 1403, 1634, and 1075 cm–1, respectively,
indicating the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between
κ-CAR and KGM. These changes were caused by the anionic electrolyte
generated by the half-ester sulfate groups on κ-CAR residues
after the formation of the compound and the intermolecular hydrogen
bond between O–SO3– in κ-CAR
and KGM. The existence of hydrogen bonds played a very important role
in the increase in the efficiency of the ligand glue system (CK composite).
Furthermore, the spectrum of the CK composite was similar to that
of κ-CAR and only showed some notable differences within the
fingerprint area. It can be speculated that the ligand glue system
formed the main κ-CAR network structure, in which a core of
κ-CAR chains aggregated with KGM chains attached to the surface.
Here, KGM played an important role in improving the elastic and viscous
properties of the ligand glue system.25−27 For GO, characteristic
peaks appeared for carboxylic
acids and carbonyl group C=O (1730 cm–1),
aromatic C=C (1622 cm–1), carboxy C–O
(1414 cm–1), epoxy C–O (1228 cm–1), C–O (1116 cm–1), and C–O–C
(1035 cm–1).28 Comparison
of the spectra of pure GO, CK composite films, and CKG nanocomposite
films shows that the following changes occurred in the spectra of
the CKG nanocomposite films. The vibration bands of the −OH,
C–O, C–H, and C6–OH groups were weakened
and shifted to 3426, 1635, 1401, and 1069 cm–1,
respectively, because of the presence of strong intermolecular hydrogen
bonds between GO and the CK composite.29 The vibration bands of carboxylic acids and carbonyl group C=O
(1730 cm–1), aromatic C=C (1622 cm–1), epoxy C–O (1228 cm–1), and C–O–C
(1035 cm–1) cannot be observed clearly. This is
most likely due to the vibration bands of the small amount of GO being
overlapped by the spectrum of the CK composite. No new vibration bands
were observed, indicating that with the exception of intermolecular
hydrogen bonds no new chemical bonds are present. Such confirmed interactions
in the assembled films would provide a solid foundation, resulting
in enhanced mechanical properties.

To further elucidate the
CK–GO interactions, we investigated the rheological properties
of CKG solutions with different GO concentrations used for film casting
(Figure 2c). We found
that both the storage modulus, G′, and the
loss modulus, G″, increased with increasing
GO concentration up to 7.5 wt %; however, they declined dramatically
at 10 wt %, which was most probably caused by the interactions between
GO and CK, which are also beneficial for enhancing the mechanical
properties of the as-prepared nanocomposites.11,30 Moreover,
the changes in the storage modulus, G′, and
loss modulus, G″, were consistent with the
change in the TS. With increasing GO concentration, the slope of the
storage modulus plotted against the GO concentration of CKG solutions
was much steeper than that of the loss modulus. For example, relative
to those of the pure CK, the G′ of CKG7.5
is significantly increased by 227.2%, whereas the G″ is improved by 133.3%. Furthermore, it was found that the
storage modulus, G′, and loss modulus, G″, of pristine GO are very low, indicating that
the effect of GO concentration on the modulus of the suspensions was
slight.23 This indicated the existence
of strong interactions of GO with the molecular chains of CK and restricted
mobility of CK molecules.

The dependence of the rheological
properties of the CKG composites on the GO concentration was quantified
using the analyses discussed above. These experiments also demonstrated
that the properties of CK can be controlled by incorporation of different
GO concentrations, which strongly indicated the intense interactions
between the CK molecules and GO nanosheets.

To prove that the
existence of strong CK–GO interactions contributes to the enhanced
mechanical properties of their macroscopic assemblies, tensile stress–strain
curves were plotted for CK and CKG composite films with different
weight ratios of GO to CK, as shown in Figure 3. Here, the pure CKG
goes to the CKG without dispose. For pure CKG, Young’s modulus
and the TS of the CKG composite were significantly enhanced with increasing
GO concentrations relative to those for CK (Figure 3a). For a GO concentration of 7.5 wt %, Young’s
modulus and the TS of the CKG composite increased by 491.5 and 129.5%,
achieving the best performance
of 14.6 GPa and 126.9 MPa, respectively. With an increase in the GO
concentration up to 7.5 wt %, the TS and Young’s modulus also
increased, but the ultimate strain (US) decreased (Figure 3b,c). These changes were in
accordance with the linear rule. Upon further increase of the GO concentration
to 10 wt %, the TS and Young’s modulus decreased drastically.
The high viscosity of
the CKG composite caused by the strong interactions of GO with the
molecular chains of CK damaged the uniform dispersion of GO at high
GO concentration, resulting in the aggregation that gave rise to the
observed attenuation of the mechanical properties. The aggregation
was revealed by
the appearance of the characteristic GO diffraction peak at 9.3°
and graphite diffraction peak at 28° in the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the CKG-10 wt % film (Figure S3).31 The small-angle XRD pattern
clearly showed the very obvious GO characteristic peak with an increase
in concentration. By FTIR spectroscopy analysis, we showed that with
the exception of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, no new chemical bonds
are formed among κ-CAR, KGM, and GO. As GO nanosheets increased
the toughness of CK, we can deduce that when the GO concentration
reached the critical value the number and interactions of hydrogen
bonds formed among the three components, κ-CAR, KGM, and GO,
were the largest and strongest, leading to optimal mechanical properties.
When the GO concentration continued to increase, the distance between
the GO nanosheets became smaller, caused by the molecular interatomic
forces, leading to aggregation of the GO nanosheets. Interlayer sliding
between the gathered GO layers would weaken the strengthening effect
on the mechanical properties of the film. For pure CKG, we found that
the critical value of GO concentration was 7.5 wt %.

curves of the pure CKG nanocomposite films. (b, c) Effect of GO concentration

To evaluate
the reliability of CKG in practical applications, cold and hot shock
and ozone aging resistance tests were used to manipulate the films.
The mechanical properties
of the films were evaluated to investigate the effect of cold and
hot shock and ozone aging on the film. In this article, cold and hot shock
CKG and ozone aging CKG represent CKG subjected to cold and hot shock
and ozone aging tests, respectively. For cold and hot shock CKG and
ozone aging CKG, Young’s modulus and the TS were significantly
enhanced with increasing GO concentration relative to those of CK
and significantly reduced relative to those of pure CKG (Figure 4a,b).

and CKG7.5 nanocomposite films before (CK and CKG7.5) and after cold
and hot shock (10 and 30 min) and ozone aging (50, 100, and 150 ppm)
tests.

Effect of Cold and Hot Shock on CKG Films
Cold and hot shock CKG showed results different from those for
pure
CKG (Figure 5a,b).
At a GO concentration of 5 wt %, the best Young’s modulus and
TS of the 10 min test were increased by 31.1 and 60.9%, yielding 1.42
GPa and 65.4 MPa, respectively, and the 30 min test showed a higher
decrease than that in the 10 min test. The decrease in the TS 
of CKG was much higher than that for CK, pure CKG, and pure CK. This
can be due to the more
serious destruction of the interaction between the GO and CK than
the interaction between the κ-CAR and KGM.

properties of CKG films. (a) Stress–strain curves of cold and
hot shock CKG nanocomposite films at 10 and 30 min, respectively.
(b) TS of pure CKG and cold and hot shock CKG (at 10 and 30 min) nanocomposite
films at different GO concentrations.

Effects of Ozone Aging on CKG Films
The
ozone aging CKG
was the same as that of the pure CKG when the ozone concentration
at 50 ppm, Young’s modulus and TS of the composite at the GO
concentration of 7.5 wt % were increased by 181.6 and 440.1%, achieving
3.34 GPa and 80.0 MPa, respectively. With an increase in the ozone
concentration to 100 and 150 ppm, the performance of the mechanical
properties decreased, and the best value was obtained at a GO concentration
of 5 wt % (Figure 6a,b). On the basis of the dramatic decline in the TS of CK, it can
be suggested that GO played an important role in resisting ozone aging,
owing to its full oxidation, and interaction among the three components
resulted in better performance at a lower GO concentration. The reaction
between ozone and the polymer resulted in a serious reduction in the
mechanical strength of CK, indicating that ozone is an effective agent
for the modification of polymers through many chemical reactions,
such as the formation of hydroperoxide and peroxide groups, chain
scissions, and intramolecular rearrangements.32 Because only intermolecular hydrogen bonds were present in CKG,
it can be indicated that ozone destroyed these bonds by reacting with
the polymers.

of CKG films. (a) Stress–strain
curves of the ozone aging CKG nanocomposite films at 50, 100, and
150 ppm. (b) TS of the pure CKG and ozone aging CKG (50, 100, and
150 ppm) nanocomposite films at different GO concentrations.

In this work, we found that the
critical values
of GO concentrations for pure CKG, cold and hot shock CKG, and ozone
aging CKG are 7.5, 5, and 7.5 wt % (50 ppm) or 5 wt % (100 and 150
ppm), respectively. For cold and hot shock CKG, the difference can
be due to the much more severe destruction of the interaction between
GO and CK. Owing to the reaction
between ozone and the polymer, the interaction between κ-CAR
and KGM was destroyed, resulting in a change in the critical value
of GO concentration with a change in the ozone concentration. The
above two analyses were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy on cold and
hot shock CKG and ozone aging CKG, indicating that the vibration bands
of −OH and C–H at 3426 and 2927 cm–1 were weakened (Figure 7a,b). Comparison of the different GO concentrations and postprocessing
of the obtained CKG results showed that CKG7.5 showed the best comprehensive
performance, on the basis of the results presented in Figures 8 and 9. In general, the CKG films maintained a definite TS after cold and
hot shock and ozone aging and demonstrated their high reliability,
making them favorable for practical applications.

As plotted
in Figure 10, compared
with the reported composite films, the CKG7.5 film presented in our
work exhibited remarkable mechanical properties. Its TS was of the
same order of magnitude as that of the previous GO-based nanocomposite
films and that reported in previous papers,4,12,33−40 for example, 1.58 times higher than that
of the synthesized polymer–GO films (PVA–GO film, 80.2
MPa)34 and close to the values for natural
polymer–GO mixture films (GO–chitosan film, 137.5 MPa).37 Although CKG did not exhibit the best TS, its
US was higher than that of the other previous GO-based nanocomposite
films, which had a higher TS. CKG films showed outstanding toughness.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
Food-quality
κ-CAR
was obtained from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China); KGM was provided
by Mianyang Haomao Konjac Food Co. Ltd. (Sichuan, China); and GO nanosheets
were obtained from flake graphite (<30 μm, Qingdao, China)
using the modified Hummers’ method.41

Preparation of CKG Films
CKG
films were obtained by evaporation-induced self-assembly after solubilization
of film-forming substances. For solubilization of film-forming substances,
κ-CAR and KGM powder should first be mixed in a ratio of 5.5:4.5,
determined by the preliminary experiment (Figure S2, Table S1). Then, the mixed powder should be added into
200 mL of GO solution after ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Thereafter,
the reactant was reacted at 353 K for 30 min under magnetic stirring
at 450 rpm, followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. The added GO amounts
were set as 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 wt %. The proportions of the reactants
for the CKG films are presented in Table S2. The film-forming solution was poured into a plate mold slowly to
form a flat solution membrane layer by flow-casting; it was then dried
at 303 K, followed by careful peeling of the dried film after keeping
it at room temperature for 2 h. Figure 1a illustrates the self-assembly based simple, efficient,
and scalable preparation procedure for CK–GO nanocomposite
films using GO as the nanoscale building block and natural polymers
κ-CAR and KGM as organic adhesion agents.

Characterization
A digital micrometer (CHY-C
2; Languang, China) was used to measure the film thickness, with an
accuracy of 0.1 μm. The structural characteristics of the samples
were studied by XRD (Panalytical X’Pert Pro) using Cu Kα
radiation. The surface morphologies and cross sections of the samples
were analyzed by SEM (JSM-6390 LV; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The surface
of the film was coated with gold particles (Bio-Rad type SC 502; JEOL
Ltd, Japan) by sputtering for 60 s, allowing surface visualization
using an accelerating voltage of 30 kV, followed by observation at
a magnification of 2000–20 000×. The FTIR spectra
of the films were recorded using pressed KBr pellets (Aldrich, 99%,
analytical reagent), scanned from 4000 to 400 cm–1 using a Nicolet 8700 FTIR spectrometer at room temperature. All
film samples were preconditioned in a constant-temperature humidity
chamber set at 298 K and 50% RH for at least 48 h before further testing.
In the rheological measurements, the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) were measured
using a HAAKE RS 6000 Rotational Rheometer (Germany) at 298 ±
0.05 K.

Measurement of Mechanical Properties
The mechanical
properties of the films, including the TS, US, and
elasticity modulus (E), were determined according
to the standard GB-T 1040.3 2006 method, using an MTS Testing Machine
(CMT 5305; MTS Industrial Systems (China) Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China)
equipped with a 0.25 kN load cell. Rectangular strips (150 ×
10 mm2) were cut from the individually prepared films.
The initial grip separation was set at 50 mm and the cross-head speed
was set at 5 mm/min. Five samples for each type of film were replicated.

Cold and Hot Shock Test
The
cold and hot shock test was used to evaluate the reliability of the
films in practical applications. The mechanical properties were measured
after five cycles of cold and hot shock at a low temperature (TA) of 243 K and a high temperature (TB) of 353 K, with a test duration of 10 or 30
min according to the GB/T 2423 standard, using programmable hot and
cold impact test cases (GT-CHT-2 S; Gotech Testing Machines Inc. Co.,
Ltd., China).

Ozone Aging Resistance
Test
The ozone aging resistance test was also used to evaluate
the reliability of the films in practical applications. The mechanical
properties were tested by conducting ozone aging resistance tests
at ozone concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 ppm at 313 K for 48 h
according to the standard GB/T 7762-2003 method using an economical
ozone resistance tester (OZ-0200-AC; Huasheng instrument (China) Co.,
Ltd., China). The reliability of the films in practical applications
was evaluated by comparing their mechanical properties before and
after disposal (cold and hot shock and ozone aging).

Conclusions
In summary, we have
demonstrated a self-assembly based, simple, efficient, and scalable
method to prepare CK–GO nanocomposite films with a well-defined
layered structure. The synthesis was carried out on the basis of the
strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between GO nanosheets and the
κ-CAR and KGM molecules, with GO being the nanoscale building
block and the naturally occurring polymers, κ-CAR and KGM, being
organic adhesion agents. The obtained CKG7.5 composite film exhibited
excellent mechanical properties, with the same order of magnitude
as that of previously investigated GO-based nanocomposite films and
that in previous papers. Significantly, the CKG films maintained a
definite TS after cold and hot shock and ozone aging and demonstrated
good reliability in practical applications, especially superior ozone
resistance. This natural polymer–GO composite film with excellent
properties showed promise for a wide range of applications in diverse
fields, such as food packaging, tissue engineering, and biological
devices (Figure S6).
