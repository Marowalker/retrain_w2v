Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) has been employed
to obtain information about the nature of interactions in the liquid
solutions of pure solvents and their mixtures of m-chlorotoluene (MCT) with 1-alkanol systems at different mole fractions.
Furthermore, densities (ρ) and speeds of sound (u) of binary mixtures of MCT with a set of five 1-alkanols, namely,
1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-heptanol, were
measured as a function of composition at 298.15 K. From the experimental
quantities, the excess volumes (VE), isentropic
compressibility (ks), and excess isentropic
compressibility (ksE) were calculated for the binary mixtures over
the entire composition range and under the atmospheric pressure. These
excess properties (VE) and (ksE) were correlated
with the Redlich–Kister polynomial equation. Additionally,
theoretical density functional theory calculations and natural bond
orbital analyses were carried out to further discern the nature and
strength of interactions between MCT and 1-alkanols. Moreover, the
recorded FT-IR spectra-derived excess properties and quantum chemically
derived data revealed the presence of interactions between component
molecules in binary liquid solutions.

1 Introduction
Over
the last several years, hydrogen bonding comprising the component
molecules is found as the major path for academic and industrial communities
to analyze the nature of the molecular interactions in solution chemistry
as well as design of applications in engineering and pharmaceutical
sciences. The information on the phase and interfacial properties
are vital and necessary to operate and design the processes, i.e.,
separation or reaction steps in chemical processes.1 However, there is widespread literature data on thermophysical
and excess thermodynamic properties, which provides information about
intra- and intermolecular interactions in pure liquids and their mixtures.
But there are still some unfilled gaps in understanding the nature
of different molecular interactions that exist in liquid mixtures.
This is partly due to scarcity of spectral evidences and sound theoretical
data.1−4

In this context, 1-alkanols are polar and self-associated
molecules
that form a network of H bonds in solution. Therefore, in the pure
liquid state, alkanol molecules are associated with hydrogen bonding
as linear and chain aggregates, as can be seen in Figure S1. Also, 1-alkanols are cheap and used as solvents
in a variety of chemical and technological processes.5−7 Furthermore, the knowledge of excess thermodynamic properties of
binary liquid mixtures containing halogenated hydrocarbons is very
staple due to their practical applications in various fields, including
detergents, rubber, plastics, and aerosol propellants.8 The m-chlorotoluene (MCT) solvent is one
of the methyl substituted halo-benzenes that is used as an intermediate
in pesticide pharmaceutical and dye industries.9

Extensive survey of the literature showed that few
studies have
been carried out on measurements of thermophysical properties of binary
mixtures containing MCT with dimethylformamide,9 1-decanol,10 tetrahydrofuran,11 chloroalkanes,12 aromatic
hydrocarbons,13 and acetophenone.14 In view of the aforementioned points, the present
study mainly focused on thermophysical and excess thermodynamic properties
of MCT with 1-alkanols (C3–C7). The extent
of self-association of 1-alkanols and the effect of mixing with MCT
at different mole ratios was investigated using Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations were carried out to probe into the nature of molecular
interactions between isolated molecules of MCT and 1-alkanols in a
1:1 dimer. Eventually, both experimental and computational studies
explicitly explained the intermolecular interactions between MCT and
1-alkanol binary mixtures.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Experimental Details
2.1.1 Materials
The
percentage purities
of all of the liquids obtained from S D Fine-Chem Ltd., India are
as follows: MCT (99.5%), 1-propanol (99.5%), 1-butanol (99.5%), 1-pentanol
(99.0%), 1-hexanol (98.5%), and 1-heptanol (99.5%). The source, purity,

measured densities, speed of sound, heat capacities, and thermal expansion
coefficient to those of corresponding pure liquids available in the
literature.3,8,10,15−39 The comparative data are listed in Table 2.

2.1.2 Apparatus
and Procedure
The water
content of organic solvents used in the present study was measured
using Analab (Micro Aqua Cal 100) Karl Fischer Titrator and Karl Fisher
reagent from Merck.40 It can detect water
content from less than 10 ppm to 100% by conductometric titration
with dual platinum electrode. All of the binary liquid mixtures were
prepared by weighing appropriate amounts of pure liquids on an electronic
balance (Afcoset, ER-120A, India) with a precision of ±0.1 mg.
Each component was syringed into airtight stopper bottles to minimize
losses due to evaporation, which are shaken to ensure complete homogeneity
of the two solvents.40 The uncertainty
of the mole fraction was ±0.0005. Densities of the pure liquids
and their mixtures were measured by using a Rudolph Research Analytical
Digital Densitometer (DDM-2911 model) with an accuracy of ±0.02
K in temperature and ±0.00005 g cm–3 in density.40 The speed of sound measurements was measured
using a commercially available single-crystal ultrasonic interferometer
(model F-05) from Mittal Enterprises, New Delhi, India, at 2 MHz frequency
at various temperatures with accuracy of ±0.5 m s–1.40 For all speed of sound measurements,
the temperature was controlled at ±0.02 K by circulating the
water from a constant temperature bath (model MV F-25 Julabo/Germany).40

2.2 FT-IR Measurements
To study the nature
and sites of interactions of 1-alkanols of different chain lengths
and MCT, at different compositions, FT-IR spectra were recorded and
the interactions were probed by comparing the IR bands of the pure
compounds and the mixtures. The infrared spectra of pure liquids and
their bubble-free homogeneous binary liquid mixtures were recorded
within the range of 500–4000 cm–1 at room
temperature by using Cary 670 series FT-IR from Agilent Technologies,
South Africa. The device has 0.002 cm–1 precision,
and 110 scans were performed at 16 cm–1 resolution
and averaged.

2.3 Computational Details
To provide
further insights on the nature and strength of interactions between
1-alkanols and MCT, isolated dimers of MCT/1-alkanols were modeled
and studied quantum chemically. Initial geometries of 1-alkanols and
MCT were modeled with the aid of Gauss View 5.0 and used as input
for density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Optimized geometries
of MCT and each alkanol were used as input geometries for 1:1 MCT/1-alkanol
complexes. It is worth mentioning that the 1:1 complex is only a representation
of possible interactions within the binary system. However, this assumption
of the 1:1 complex is supported by previous studies on interactions
of alkanols with different organic molecules such as alkylmethacrylates41 acrylic esters.42,43 Full geometry
optimization was carried out on each of the studied 1-alkanols and
MCT. Geometry optimization was then carried out on MCT/1-alkanol complexes.
Force constant calculations were carried out on each optimized structure
to verify that they correspond to the true energy minimum. Thermodynamic
parameters were derived from the vibrational frequencies of the molecules.

The model chemistry employed was B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p), which is a
combination of the Becke 3-parameter exchange functional, the Lee–Yang–Parr
correlation functional (B3LYP),44,45 and the 6-31++G(d,p)
basis set. Liu et al.46 had proven and
enlisted B3LYP as one of the hybrid DFT functionals that produces
excellent description of H-bonding interactions between water molecules.
The 6-31++G(d,p) basis set has been used in Hartree–Fock and
MP2 calculations to produce satisfactory results for some H-bond energies.47 The utilization of B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) model
in the present work is also in relation to its success in a study
on the correlation between bond lengths in OHN and OHCl fragments,48 in which the same type of H bond considered
in the present study was suitably treated. Malik et al.49 had also used a similar model (B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p))
to predict the internuclear distances between interacting atoms in
mixtures of piperidine and some cyclic ketones.

Furthermore,
exploration of donor–acceptor interactions
between MCT and 1-alkanols was carried out using the natural bond
orbital (NBO) analysis calculations. NBO analysis allows a probe into
the interplay of hyperconjugation and hybridization that accompany
MCT/1-alkanol complex formation. Hyperconjugation interaction energy
(E(2)) was calculated from the solution to the second-order
Fock matrix according to the equation50,51 1  where ⟨σi|F|σj⟩2 or Fij2 is the off diagonal Fock matrix element between
the i (donor) and j (acceptor) NBOs,
εi and εj, are the energies of i and j NBOs, and ni is the occupancy or population
of the i (donor) NBO.

Windows-based Gaussian
09 software52 was used for all calculations,
whereas NBO version 3.1 implemented
in Gaussian 09 was used for the bond orbital analyses.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Volumetric Behavior
Densities (ρ)
of pure and liquid mixtures are used to solve various problems in
industries, such as quality control in the production of industrial
liquids, concentration determination in the food industries, and measuring
the concentration of sugar and alkanols. The experimental and calculated
thermodynamics properties, such as densities (ρ), speed of sound
(u), excess volumes (VE), isentropic compressibilities (ks),
and excess isentropic compressibilities (ksE) for all the binary
mixtures of MCT with 1-alkanol at 298.15 K are given in Table 3. The excess volume data were
calculated from the densities of pure liquids and their mixtures using
the following equation 2  where x, M, and ρ are mole
fraction, molar mass, and density, respectively.
The subscripts i and m represent
pure components and mixture, respectively.

The excess volume data, which are plotted in Figure S2 for all of the mixtures over the entire
composition
range at 298.15 K, display an inversion sign for the binary mixtures
of MCT with 1-alkanols, such as 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol,
1-hexanol, and 1-heptanol. When the alkanol molecules are mixed with
polar molecules like MCT, there could be mutual dissociation of the
hydrogen-bonded structures present in pure alkanols with subsequent
formation of intermolecular hydrogen bond (Cl···HO)
between the chlorine atom of MCT molecule and hydroxyl group of 1-alkanols
and electrostatic interactions. These interactions will have different
resultant contributions to the volumes of the mixtures.

It can
be seen from Figure S2 that the
excess volumes of the MCT in the 1-alkanol binary mixture show negative
to positive values over the entire mole fraction region and most negative VE values were observed at the higher concentration
region of 1-alkanols and positive VE values
in the MCT concentration-rich region. This could be attributed to
the stronger interactions between the hydroxyl group of 1-alkanol
and electronegative chlorine atom on the toluene molecule through
hydrogen bonding at the rich concentration region of alkanols. Furthermore,
the negative excess volume tends to shift toward positive values with
increasing mole fraction of MCT due to rupturing of hydrogen bonding
between unlike molecules in the mixture. The algebraic value of VE for the mixtures of MCT with 1-alkanols following
the order is: 1-propanol < 1-butanol < 1-pentanol < 1-hexanol
< 1-heptanol. This order implies that MCT shows that the strong
H-bonding interactions with 1-propanol than with those for the rest
of the 1-alkanols due to the nonpolar nature is increased with increasing
the −CH2 group. The higher negative VE values of MCT in the mixture of MCT with the 1-propanol
system show that the stronger solvent–solute interactions at
the rich concentration region of alkanols as compared to the lower
negative VE values of MCT in the mixture
of MCT with the rest of the 1-alkanols form 1-butanol to 1-heptanol,
which show comparatively weaker solvent–solute interactions
at the rich concentration region of alkanols.3,5,53−55

The measurement
of the speed of sound has been successfully employed
to understand the nature of molecular interactions in pure liquids
and their liquid mixtures. Speed of sound measurements are highly
sensitive to molecular interactions and can be used to provide qualitative
information about the nature of physical and chemical strength of
the interaction in liquid mixtures.38,56 The isentropic
compressibilities (ks) were calculated
from the Newton–Laplace equation given below 3  where ρ is the density and u is the speed
of sound of the binary mixtures.

The values of excess isentropic
compressibility (ksE) were calculated
from the following relations recommended by Benson and Kiyohara57 and Douheret et al.58 4   5  Here, Cp,i and αi are molar heat capacity
and thermal expansion coefficient, respectively, for the ith component of the mixture. The values of αi were calculated from the equation αi = (∂V/∂T)P/V = −1/ρ(∂ρ–1/∂T)P and are listed in Table 2. The volume fraction ϕi was calculated as 6  The plots of excess isentropic
compressibility
(ksE) with mole fraction (x1) for
the binary mixtures of MCT with 1-alkanol (C3–C7) at 298.15 K are depicted in Figure S3. According to Fort and Moore,59 the negative
excess isentropic compressibilities are indicative of strong interactions
in the liquid mixtures, which can be attributed to charge transfer,
dipole–dipole, and dipole–induced dipole interactions
between component molecules. However, the positive sign indicates
weaker interactions that are attributed to dispersion (London) forces,
which are likely to be operative in every case. In the present study,
the (ksE) values exhibit inversion behavior at all temperatures over
the whole composition range. The (ksE) values in Figure S3 reveal that as the chain length of alkanols increase,
the negative excess isentropic compressibilities decrease. This is
due to weaker dipole–dipole interactions in higher alkanols
as a result of decrease in polarizability.60 The algebraic values of (ksE) for the mixtures of MCT with
1-alkanol fall in the order: 1-propanol < 1-butanol < 1-pentanol
< 1-hexanol < 1-heptanol.

The excess property (yE) was fitted
by the Redlich–Kister type polynomial equation61 7  where yE is VE or ksE and x1 and x2 refer to
the mole fractions of
the pure components. The corresponding standard deviations σ
were computed using the relation 8  where ycalcE is the calculated value of
excess properties, n is the number of data points,
and p is the number of coefficients in eq 7, and the standard deviations of
all of the binary mixtures are presented in Table 4.

3.2 FT-IR
Studies
Figures S4–S6 show
the FT-IR spectrum of binary liquid
mixtures of MCT and 1-alkanols at different mole fractions at the
range of wavenumbers, which is reported in Table 5. From the spectrum, it is important to analyze
the −O–H, −C–H, −C–O, and
−C–Cl stretching bands and predict the possible molecular
interactions in liquid mixtures.

3.2.1 O–H Stretching
Region
Figure S4 shows that the
FT-IR spectrum of pure
1-alknols (C3–C7) and their binary mixtures
with MCT over the entire range of mole fractions in the range of 2700–3700
cm–1. A broad band appears at 3320, 3321, 3322,
3318, and 3323 cm–1 for pure 1-propanol, 1-butanol,
1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-heptanol, respectively. This is a clear
evidence for self-association of 1-alkanol involved in the hydrogen
bonding in the pure state. When the composition of MCT is added to
1-alkanols incrementally, the O–H stretching band of pure 1-alkanol
shifted to around (3321–3340) cm–1 in all
of the binary liquid mixtures. From the above interpretations, it
can be concluded that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds in pure 1-alkanol
molecule was broken gradually by increasing the concentration of MCT
and the −OH group of the 1-alkanol molecule is directly involved
in the formation of hydrogen bonding between component molecules.
As can be seen in Figure S4, the sharp
O–H stretching band of pure 1-alkanols diminishes and disappears
completely with increasing mole fraction of MCT in all the binary
mixtures. This implies that self-associated H-bond formation within
pure 1-alkanol molecules decrease with increasing mass fraction of
MCT.

3.2.2 C–H Stretching Region
In Figure S4, it was found that a sharp band appears
at around 2850–2950 cm–1, which is assigned
to the C–H stretching vibrational frequency of pure 1-alkanol.
When 1-alkanol was mixed with MCT, the shape of C–H stretching
bands changed significantly to a weak band but did not disappear completely.
This observation is attributed to the rupturing of van der Waals interactions
in pure alkanols by increasing the concentration of MCT.

3.2.3 C–O Stretching Region
Generally,
in pure 1-alkanol molecules, the oxygen atom is the polar part, which
ensures dipole interactions with other solvent molecules. Figure S5 shows the C–O stretching frequencies
of pure 1-alkanols, MCT, and their five binary mixtures in the range
of 1000–1200 cm–1. However, the C–O
stretching frequency of pure 1-alkanols (C3–C7) appears at 1059, 1057, 1051, 1048, and 1050 cm–1, respectively. Nonetheless, the C–O stretching frequencies
increase as the mole fraction of MCT increases in the mixture of 1-alkanols.
Undoubtedly, this apparently discloses that the formation of ion-induced
dipole interactions between MCT and 1-alkanol mixtures due to the
interruption of dipole–dipole interactions existing in 1-alkanol
molecules.

3.2.4 C–Cl Stretching
Region
Figure S6 shows the C–Cl
stretching frequencies
of pure MCT and binary mixtures with 1-alkanols over the entire mole
fractions within 600–700 cm–1. The band observed
at 680 cm–1 for MCT is assigned to the C–Cl
stretching vibration coupled with the C–C–C in-plane
deformation.62 Consequently, it shows that
the C–Cl stretching frequencies decrease by increasing the
concentration of 1-alkanol molecules in liquid mixtures. It can be
observed that the C–H···Cl type of hydrogen
bonds are rupturing gradually by the addition of alkanol and the chlorine
atom forms weak hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group of 1-alkanol
molecules.

3.3 DFT Explanations of Interactions
between MCT
and 1-Alkanols
The lowest energy configurations of 1:1 complexes
of MCT with C3–C7 1-alkanols are shown
in Figure S7. Atom numbering in Figure S7 was arbitrary and only for the purpose
of explanation of results. Results revealed that the interactions
between MCT and the studied 1-alkanols feature two types of H bonds,
which are OH···Cl and HO···HC. The OH···Cl
bond lengths in the complexes are in the range of 2.661–2.687
Å, with maximum bond length observed for OH···Cl
involving 1-propanol. Similar results have been reported for OH···Cl
elsewhere.48 The trend of OH···Cl
bond lengths suggests manifestation of a stronger bond by the longer
chain alkanol, although the trend is slightly tainted at 1-hexanol.
The HO···HC bond lengths are in the range of 2.397–2.459
Å. The HO···HC bond length, unlike OH···Cl,
does not follow a definite pattern with increasing alkanol chain length.
However, the smallest HO···HC bond was observed for
the dimer involving 1-propanol. The lowest energy configurations of
the dimers differ in the orientation of MCT, leading to the variation
of the C–H that interacts with the O–H of alkanols.
The H atom on C4 of MCT (on the basis of the numbering
pattern in Figure S7) was used in interacting
with 1-propanol and 1-pentanol, whereas the one on C2 was
used in 1-butanol, 1-hexanol, and 1-heptanol. No definite explanation
could be provided for this inversion of MCT orientation toward 1-alkanols.

The effect of donor–acceptor interactions between MCT and
1-alkanols on neighboring bond lengths was investigated. Simultaneous
lengthening and shortening of bonds directly involved in charge acceptance
and donation in intermolecular H-bond formation have been reported
in the literature.63 The bond length of
O–H (H9–O10) in isolated 1-alkanols was ca. 0.965 Å,
whereas the C–Cl (C3–Cl8) bond
length in isolated MCT was ca. 1.762 Å. Upon donor–acceptor
interactions via OH···Cl (lone pair (LP)) donation
from Cl atom of MCT and acceptance by antibonding orbital of alkanol
(O–H) and CO···HC (donation from O atom of 1-alkanol
and acceptance by the H atom of C–H bond in MCT), O–H
(H9–O10) bond length slightly elongated to ca. 0.967 Å,
whereas the C–Cl (C3–Cl8) bond
length was elongated to ca. 1.771 Å. The C–H bond of MCT
(C4–H4 or C2–H2) involved in interaction with the O atom of alkanol is also
lengthened in each case (ca. 1.086 Å for C4–H4, 1.085 Å for C2–H2). These
bonds were 1.085 and 1.084 Å, respectively, in isolated MCT monomer.

The energy gaps between frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of MCT
and 1-alkanols were calculated and listed in Table 6. The relative ease of electron transfer
from MCT to 1-alkanols and converse was gauged by the values of 1ΔELUMO–HOMO and 2ΔELUMO–HOMO. The
results in Table 6 showed
that 1-hexanol and 1-heptanol have the least values of both 1ΔELUMO–HOMO and 2ΔELUMO–HOMO, suggesting
that the feasibility of 1:1 complex formation between MCT and 1-alkanols
increases with increasing chain length of alkanols. This is converse
to the strength of interactions between MCT and 1-alkanols obtained
from the experimental study.

Stabilization energy (ΔE) and entropy change
(ΔS) as a result of dimer formation were calculated
as the difference between the corresponding values of the dimers and
those of the isolated monomers (i.e., ΔE = EAB – EA – EB, ΔS = SAB – SA – SB). The values of ΔE and
ΔS are listed in Table 7. The values of ΔE in Table 7 also correspond
to interaction energies. Negative ΔE is indicative
of energetically favorable dimer.46 Likewise,
a negative value of ΔS implies entropy favorability
of dimer formation due to increased orderliness of the dimer compared
to that of the isolated monomers. The results in Table 7 showed increasing magnitude
of ΔE with increasing alkanol chain length.
This corresponds to an increasing degree of interactions between MCT
and 1-alkanols with increasing alkanol chain length. Also, the degree
of orderliness in the dimer increases with increasing chain length.
It is worthy of mention, however, that the effect of chain length
of the alkanols on their interactions with MCT is less pronounced
for alkanols that differ by only one carbon atom (−CH3). In other words, 1:1 MCT/1-alkanol dimers of 1-propanol and 1-butanol
have nearly the same values of ΔE, whereas
those of 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol are also the same.

NBO analysis has been used in the
literature to describe the nature
of donor–acceptor interactions involving intermolecular hydrogen
bonds.63 Results of second-order perturbation
(interaction) energies (E(2)) for donor–acceptor
interactions in 1:1 MCT/1-alkanol dimers are listed in Table 8. The values of E(2) for the two types of lone pair (LP) to antibonding (BD*) interactions
involved in the dimers, as listed in Table 8, revealed that LP(2)Cl8 →
BD*(1)H9–O10 interaction is generally stronger than LP(1)O10→BD*(1)C2–H2 (or LP(1)O10 → BD*(1)C4–H4) interaction. The strength of LP(2)Cl8 → BD*(1)H9–O10 interaction increases with increasing
alkanol chain length, whereas the strength of LP(1)O10 → BD*(1)
C2–H2 (or LP(1)O10 → BD*(1)C4–H4) interaction does not follow a definite
pattern.

The overall results of quantum chemical calculations
obtained in
the present study suggest that the strength of interactions between
MCT and 1-alkanols increases with increasing alkyl chain length of
alkanol. This, however, is contrary to experimental observations.
Although the effect of chain length on such interactions is not significant
between successive alkanols. The dissention between experimental and
theoretical results might be due to the existence of other interactions
that might exist in solution, which were not taken into consideration
in the molecular modeling. However, the theoretical study provides
more insights into the donor–acceptor interactions between
MCT and 1-alkanols and the nature and strength of H bonds involved
(Table 8).

4 Conclusions
The present study investigates the intermolecular
interactions
between straight-chain 1-alkanols of C3–C7 chain length and m-chlorotoluene (MCT) at various
compositions of binary liquid mixtures. Volumetric techniques, such
as densitometer, ultrasonic interferometer, and FT-IR methods, were
used for the investigations. In addition, density functional theory
(DFT) method was employed to provide theoretical insights into the
1-alkanol/MCT interactions. The values of excess volume (VE) and excess isentropic compressibility (ksE) were determined
for binary liquid mixtures containing MCT and 1-alkanols (C3–C7) at 298.15 K. Inversion deviations from ideality
were observed for all of the binary systems over the entire composition
range. The Redlich–Kister polynomial was used to correlate
the results and provide a good description for VE and ksE with respect to composition for all systems.
The results revealed that there is a strong bond-making intermolecular
interaction between 1-alkanol and MCT and the strength of this interaction
decreases with increasing alkanol chain length. FT-IR spectra revealed
that the strength of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions
between self-associated alkanol–alkanol molecules and MCT–alkanol
depends on aggregation, size, or successive increment of the methylene
group (−CH2−) of 1-alkanol molecules. The
decreasing strength of intermolecular interactions between successive
1-alkanols and MCT is associated with a prospective gradual strain
of the intermolecular hydrogen bond with increasing alkyl chain length
of 1-alkanols. DFT calculations also showed the nature and strength
of prevailing H bonds in 1:1 dimers of MCT and 1-alkanols. The DFT
results predicted that the decreasing strength of the interactions
of 1-alkanols with MCT follows the trend: 1-propanol > 1-butanol >
1-pentanol > 1-hexanol > 1-heptanol. Consequently, the results
generally
showed that a larger 1-alkanol has relatively less favorable interactions
with MCT as compared to a smaller 1-alkanol. More so, the conformational
properties of 1-alkanols in MCT mixtures appeared to be mainly governed
by the strength of the interactions between the hydroxyl group of
the alkanol and the chloro group of MCT.
