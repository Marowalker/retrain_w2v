Introduction
Selaginellin represents
a structurally intriguing class of phenolic
pigments featuring unique alkynyl and p-quinone methide
functionalities, which have hitherto been found only in the genus
Selaginella.1 With their unique molecular
architectures and compelling biological activities, selaginellin and
its analogues have attracted great attention from the synthetic and
pharmacological communities.2−6 Specifically, four newly discovered selaginellin analogues with
a fluorene core, namely, selaginpulvilins, separated from S. pulvinata, have been identified as natural inhibitors
of PDE4D2.7 Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4),
which is predominantly expressed in most inflammatory and immune cells,
is a hydrolytic enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) and has been identified as a therapeutic target
in tumors,8 inflammatory diseases,9 and the central nervous system.10 Therefore, the search for new selaginellin analogues as
inhibitors of PDE4 with powerful efficiency is fascinating.

Selaginella tamariscina, collected
from Guangxi, has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine
for the treatment of hepatitis, hematuria, and traumatic injury.11 Research toward the discovery of novel PDE4
inhibitors from this plant afforded two new (1, 2) and eight known selaginellin analogues (3–10). To the best of our knowledge, 1 represents
the first example of a selaginellin analogue characterized by a 1H-2-benzopyran core. Most of the isolates showed strong
inhibitory activity against PDE4D2, and the most active, 1, significantly inhibited tubulin polymerization. In this article,
the isolation, structural elucidation, plausible biosynthetic pathway,
and biological evaluation of the isolated compounds are described.

Results
and Discussion
Selagintamarlin A (1) was obtained
as a dark red powder.
Its molecular formula, C34H24O7,
with 23° of unsaturation was established on the basis of negative-ion
high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS)
(543.1464 [M – H]−, calcd 543.1449) and 13C NMR data. Its UV spectrum showed absorption maxima at 216,
223, 260, 306, 388, and 428 nm, with characteristic values for the
π–π conjugate system of polyphenols.1a−1d The IR spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxyl (3433 cm–1), carboxyl (1703 cm–1), and aromatic
ring (1609 and 1510 cm–1) functionalities. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 exhibited signals for an
alkenyl [δH 7.40 (1H, s)], four p-substituted phenyl
groups (two were superimposed) [δH 6.48 (4H, d, J = 8.8 Hz), 6.86 (4H, d, J = 8.8 Hz),
6.27 (2H, d, J = 8.8 Hz), 6.35 (2H, d, J = 8.8 Hz), 6.70 (2H, d, J = 8.8 Hz), and 7.49 (2H,
d, J = 8.8 Hz)], and a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted phenyl
ring [δH 6.79 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz)
and 7.82 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz)].

The 13C NMR spectrum of 1 showed 22 carbon
signals, which disclosed the presence of a carboxyl (δC 169.9), an alkenyl (δC 153.8 and 98.3), four p-phenol groups (two were overlapped), a polysubstituted
phenyl ring, and an unprotonated carbon (δC 89.2),
with characteristic values of a selaginellin analogue.1a−1d Combining 1H and 13C NMR and HRESIMS data,
the molecular formula of 1 was found to be C34H24O7; there should be one more ring in 1, as the five phenyl rings, one carboxyl, and one alkenyl
only expended 22 of the 23° of unsaturation. The connections
of these phenyl rings and other groups could be explained by two-dimensional
NMR analyses. Strong heteronuclear multiple-bond correlations (HMBCs)
from the aromatic protons at δH 6.86 (4H, d, H-3,
5, 8, 12) to the quaternary carbon (δC 89.2, C-7)
indicate the presence of two geminal p-phenol groups
at C-7. The alkenyl was linked to a p-phenol group
by HMBCs from H-28 and H-32 to C-27, which was further placed at C-14
by HMBCs from H-26 to C-15 and C-19. The carboxyl and the last p-phenol group were located at C-15 and C-18 by HMBCs from
H-16 to C-34 and H-20 and H-24 to C-18, respectively. The polysubstituted
phenyl ring was further linked to C-7 by the observation of a weak
J 4 HMBC from H-17 to C-7.7 On account
of the structure of 1 demanding an additional ring, the
remaining oxygen was linked to C-7 and C-27 to form a pyran ring.
This was supported by the 13C NMR chemical shifts of C-7
and C-27, which were larger than normal. Therefore, according to the
molecular composition of 1, a pyran ring attached by
a polysubstituted phenyl ring to form a 1H-2-benzopyran
core, as described in Figure 1, was suggested for 1.

Selaginpulvilin E (2) was obtained as a brown
amorphous
powder, and the molecular formula C33H22O5 was established by its negative-ion HRESIMS (497.1402 [M
– H]−, calcd 497.1394). The 1D NMR data of 2 were very similar to those of selaginpulvilins A–D
(3–6),7 with the only difference due to the replacement of the hydroxymethyl
group in selaginpulvilin A (3) by a hydroxyl group in 2. This was verified by the key HMBCs from H-17 (δH 7.49) to C-25 (δC 132.8) and H-16 (δH 6.86) and H-17 (δH 7.49) to C-15 (δC 158.0) (Figure 2).

Figure 2 HMBCs of compound 1.

The known compounds were identified as selaginpulvilins A–D
(3–6),7 selaginellin A (7),1b selaginellin
B (8),1b selaginellin E (9),1c and selaginellin O (10)1d by NMR spectroscopic analysis,
as well as by the comparison of their physical and spectral data with
those in the literature.

The structure of selagintamarlin A
described here represents a
hitherto unknown selaginellin skeleton. Thus, a putative biogenetic
pathway for 1 is proposed (Scheme 1) to assist further studies for biomimetic
semisynthesis or total chemical synthesis. The most plausible biosynthetic
precursor of 1 is selaginellin O (10). Selaginellin
O is oxidized to form intermediate I, and hydration of I would generate intermediate II.12 The key step of this biosynthesis, the linkage
of C7–OH and C-27 of intermediate II to afford 1, is probably due to the hydroxy group attacking
the triple bond (shown as curved arrows in Scheme 1) to form a stable pyran ring.

Scheme 1 Plausible
Biosynthetic Pathways of 1
All of the isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory
activity
against PDE4D2 and computational docking into the active site of PDE4D2.
Compounds 1–10 potently inhibited
the activity of PDE4D2, with IC50 values in the range of
40–1680 nM. In particular, 1, the most active
compound, showed an IC50 of 40 nM, being 20-fold stronger
than that of the positive control (Table 1 and Figure S9). The partition coefficient values of compounds 1–10 were calculated using the Marvin Sketch program, and the
values (log D) of 1 at physiological
pHs 3.0 and 7.4 were 6.86 and
3.60, respectively (Table S2). As shown
in Figure 3a, compound 1, with the best docking score, was nicely bound to the active
binding site and filled the cavity (Supporting Information S1).

Recent studies have suggested that PDE4 inhibitors
have also been
identified as a target agent for brain tumor therapy.8 Hence, compounds 1–10 were
tested for antitumor activity against MGC-803, HepG2, A549, NCI-H460,
and SKOV-3 human cancer cell lines using the MTT method, with fluorouracil
as the positive control. The results are expressed as IC50 values, shown in Table S1. Most of the
isolates exhibited moderate antitumor activity, especially compound 1 (IC50 values in the range of 7.02–10.32
μM).

It is worth noting that diarylacrylonitrile (CC-5079)
can act as
a dual inhibitor of PDE4 and tubulin polymerization.13 Therefore, we also performed docking studies for compounds 1–10 to elucidate their structural basis.
Surprisingly, the accommodation of compound 1 in the
binding site is similar to that of colchicine, a well known tubulin
polymerization inhibitor (Figure 3b,c). Furthermore, we investigated whether compound 1 acts as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization in a dose-dependent
manner.14 As shown in Figure 4, for compound 1, an obvious inhibition of polymerization was observed at two concentrations,
and the rate of assembly as well as the final amount of microtubules
was lower than that of the control.

Figure 4 Effects of compound 1 on
microtubule dynamics. Polymerization
of tubulin at 37 °C in the presence of paclitaxel (10 μM),
Combretastatin A4 (CA-4, 10 μM), and compound 1 (10 μM and 20 μM) was monitored continuously by recording
the absorbance at 340 nm over 60 min. The reaction was initiated by
the addition of tubulin to a final concentration of 3.0 mg/mL.

In conclusion, selagintamarlin
A (1) is a 1H-2-benzopyran selaginellin
analogue with an unprecedented
skeleton isolated from S. tamariscina. Selaginpulvilin E (2) is an analogue of selaginpulvilins
A–D.7 Their structures have been
determined, and the formation of 1 and 2 was deduced from 10 and 7, respectively.
The inhibitory activity of compounds 1–10 against PDE4D2 was deeply studied. Compound 1 showed
remarkable inhibitory activity against PDE4D2 and tubulin polymerization,
which indicated that 1 might be a dual inhibitor of PDE4D2
and tubulin polymerization.

Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures
The NMR spectra were
recorded in CD3OD on a Bruker 400 MHz instrument (Bruker,
Karlsruhe, Germany), with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard.
HRESIMS data were obtained from a Thermo-Scientific Exactive spectrometer.
IR spectra (KBr) were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two FT-IR
spectrometer. Silica gel (200–300 mesh; Qingdao Marine Chemical
Factory, China), MCI gel (CHP20, 75–150 μm; Mitsubishi
Chemical Corporation, Japan), ODS (50 μm; YMC, Japan), and Sephadex
LH-20 gel (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) were used for column chromatography.
Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on GF254 plates (Qingdao
Marine Chemical Factory). Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) was carried out using a Shimadzu LC-6AD (Shimadzu, Japan) instrument
with a YMC-Pack ODS-A column (20 mm I.D. × 250 mm, S-5 μm,
12 nm) and an SPD-20A wavelength detector at 210 nm. HPLC solvents
were obtained from Tedia Company, Inc.

Plant Material
The herb of S. tamariscina was purchased
from Jingxi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
in July 2014. The plant was authenticated by Prof. Shao-Qing Tang
(Guangxi Normal University). A voucher specimen (No. 20140127) was
deposited in the School of Life Sciences, Guangxi Normal University.

Extraction and Isolation
The dried whole herb of S. tamariscina (8.861 kg) was extracted with 95%
EtOH at room temperature. The EtOH extract was concentrated under
vacuum to give a crude extract (443 g). The crude extract was chromatographed
on a silica gel column eluted with CH2Cl2/MeOH
(50:1 – 1:1) to afford 19 fractions (F1 – F19).

Fraction 11 (4.3632 g) was separated by ODS CC, with gradient MeOH/H2O (60–100%), to produce nine subfractions (F11a –
F11i). A Sephadex LH-20 column using MeOH (100%) was prepared for
F11f (417.2 mg), which finally gave four subfractions (F11f-1 –
F11f-4). F11f-1 (42.1 mg) was further purified on preparative HPLC
(45% MeCN in H2O, 8 mL/min) to yield 9 (17.7
mg, tR = 28.5 min). F11f-3 (34.5 mg) was
depurated to acquire 10 (15.7 mg) directly. F11f-4 (62.4
mg) was purified by preparative HPLC (45% MeCN in H2O,
8 mL/min) to yield 1 (6.3 mg, tR = 36.0 min). F11i (214.7 mg) was separated on Sephadex LH-20
gel using MeOH (100%) to afford 8 (24.9 mg).

Fraction
12 (20.313 g) was chromatographed over an MCI gel CC eluted
with MeOH/H2O (50–100%) to produce 20 subfractions
(F12a – F12t). F12q (114.7 mg) was purified on a preparative
HPLC (70% MeOH in H2O, 8 mL/min) to obtain 7 (24.4 mg, tR = 24.6 min). 3 subfractions
(F12m-1 – F12m-3) were obtained on a Sephadex LH-20 column
using MeOH (100%) from F12m (347.0 mg). F12m-1 (15.9 mg) was depurated
by preparative HPLC (60% MeOH in H2O, 8 mL/min) to afford 4 (6.3 mg, tR = 24.0 min). F12m-2
(40.4 mg) was purified by preparative HPLC (70% MeOH in H2O, 8 mL/min) to yield 5 (17.1 mg, tR = 16.49 min) and 6 (7.0 mg, tR = 21.76 min).

Fraction 13 (10.4326 g) was subjected
to MCI gel CC with gradient
MeOH/H2O (50–80%) to produce 20 subfractions (F13a
– F13t). F13k (40.5 mg) was separated by preparative HPLC (50%
MeOH in H2O, 8 mL/min) to yield 3 (24.0 mg, tR = 41.80 min). F13m (26.2 mg) was purified
by preparative HPLC (40% MeCN in H2O, 8 mL/min) to obtain 2 (7.0 mg, tR = 27.6 min). The
purities of all compounds were above 92%, as determined by HPLC and
NMR analysis.

PDE4D2 Assay
Human recombinant (5
pg/μL); PDE4D2
(BPS Biosciences) was added to the wells of black 96-well nonbinding
plates. Immediately, the protein was treated with the compound or
vehicle control. The enzyme was incubated with the drug for 30 min
prior to addition of 200 nM FAM-cAMP (Molecular Devices) to each assay
well. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After
incubation, the terbium (Tb)-based fluorescence intensity (FI) phosphodiesterase
evaluation assay (Molecular Devices) binding reagent was added to
each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 1 h at
room temperature. FI was measured according to the manufacturer’s
specifications using a TECAN plate reader. Each measurement was repeated
at least three times. The IC50 values were calculated by
nonlinear regression. As a reference compound, rolipram purchased
from Sigma was measured for its IC50 value before the other
assays.

Tubulin Polymerization Assay in Vitro and Competitive Inhibition
Assays
Tubulin polymerization was monitored by the change
in optical density at 340 nm using a modification of methods described
by Jordan et al.15 A purified brain tubulin
polymerization kit was purchased from Cytoskeleton (BK006P; Denver,
CO). The final buffer concentrations for tubulin polymerization contained
80.0 mM piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic
acid)sequisodium salt (pH 6.9), 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ethylene
glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic
acid, 1 mM guanosine-5’-triphosphate, and 10.2% glycerol. Test
compounds were added in different concentrations, and then, all components
except the purified tubulin were warmed to 37 °C. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of tubulin to a final concentration
of 3.0 mg/mL. Paclitaxel, CA-4, and phenstatin were used as positive
controls under the same conditions. The optical density was measured
for 1 h at 1 min intervals in BioTek’s Synergy 4 multifunction
microplate spectrophotometer with a temperature-controlled cuvette
holder. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and under conditions similar to those employed for the
tubulin polymerization assays described above.16,17

Molecular Modeling
All the docking studies were carried
out using Sybyl-X 2.0 on a windows workstation. The crystal structure
of PDE4D218 and the tubulin in complex
with colchicine (PDB: 3E22.pdb)19−21 were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The
isolated compounds were selected for the docking studies. The three-dimensional
structures of these selected compounds
were first built using Sybyl-X 2.0 sketch, followed by energy minimization
using the MMFF94 force field and Gasteiger-Marsili charges. We employed
Powell’s method for optimizing the geometry with a distance-dependent
dielectric constant and a termination energy gradient of 0.005 kcal/mol.
All of the selected compounds were automatically docked into the colchicine-binding
pocket of tubulin by an empirical scoring function and a patented
search engine in the Surflex docking program. Before the docking process,
the natural ligand was extracted; the water molecules were removed
from the crystal structure. Subsequently, the protein was prepared
using the Biopolymer module implemented in Sybyl. The polar hydrogen
atoms were added. The automated docking manner was applied in the
present work. Other parameters were established by default to estimate
the binding affinity characterized by the Surflex-Dock scores in the
software. Surflex-Dock total scores, which were expressed in −log 10
(Kd) units to represent binding affinities, were
applied to estimate the ligand–receptor interactions of the
newly designed molecules. A higher score represents a stronger binding
affinity. The optimal binding pose of the docked compounds was selected
on the basis of the Surflex scores and visual inspection of the docked
complexes.
