Charge
balance, concentration quenching, and exciton confinement
are the most important factors for realizing the use of thermally
activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for organic light-emitting
diodes. Red-orange organic light-emitting diodes of a TADF emitter
2-[4 (diphenylamino)phenyl]-10,10-dioxide-9H-thioxanthen-9-one
(TXO-TPA) have been reported by doping in a mixed p-type host system
of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) via solution-processed. We have
demonstrated the peak external quantum efficiency of 9.75%, maximum
current efficiency of 19.36 cd/A, and power efficiency of 12.17 lm/W
along with a CIE coordinate of (0.45, 0.51). The devices were compared
with different doping concentrations of TXO-TPA, and a comparative
investigation on the effect of the thickness electron transport layer
was studied. The results clearly indicated that this solution-processed
TXO-TPA device structure is a promising strategy to develop highly
efficient but simple OLED structures.

1 Introduction
Thermally activated delayed
fluorescence (TADF) was first rationalized
by Perrin in 1929,1 but since the first
successfully application to organic emitters by Adachi and co-workers
in 2012 on a simple molecular design principle, their use in fabrication
high-efficient organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has been a topic
of interest among the researchers throughout the world.2 In the past few years, various results have been
reported on molecular design, computational simulation, synthesis,
and their use in fabrication of OLEDs via solution and thermally vacuum
processed using TADF emitters.3−11 Pure organic molecules exhibiting TADF process are usually considered
as the third-generation electroluminescence (EL) materials for OLEDs.2,5,6

Different from conventional
organic molecules, TADF process is
as one of the most attractive methods for harvesting both singlet
(S1) and triplet (T1) populations in metal-free
organic materials because they can achieve a theoretical maximum internal
quantum efficiency (IQE) up to 100%.2−4,7,11−14 In TADF materials, the triplet
excitons (T1) are readily upconverted in a singlet state
(S1) by virtue of the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC)
because of their near a zero S1–T1 splitting
(ΔEST).2,7,13 Therefore, all S1 population
emit light via a prompt (direct emission, spin-allowed) or delayed
fluorescence (via rISC repopulation of S1 state) achieving
that high IQE values.4,15 Despite the significant progress
that has been made in recent years, TADF technology still has significant
challenges to achieve a full understanding of the TADF mechanism and
improve the stability of the devices containing TADF materials and
improve the radiative recombination in the emissive layer (EML).16 In addition, an efficient and reliable simple
OLED structure for real market applications in the large-area 2D diffuse
emitter lighting is the need of the current technology.

For
TADF emitters, the main objective of the researchers is to
confine all singlet and triplet excitons generated by charge recombination
in EML.17 Because of the high probability
of emission quenching, TADF-based emitters are usually employed in
an OLED as a doping (guest) into a suitable matrix (host) that should
also allow an efficient energy transfer to the emitter via Förster
and/or Dexter process. This requires specific characteristics of host
materials, for which a high T1 (>3.0 eV) to prevent
exciton
quenching.13 Second, the host should ensure
the complete charge transfer (CT) to the TADF.3,4,7,11,13,18 Third, feasible charge
carrier-transporting abilities are needed to increase the recombination
within the emitting layer.19 Therefore,
in TADF-based OLEDs, the host material plays a more vital role in
the triplet harvesting effect, compared to phosphorescent OLEDs.20,21 Most TADF molecules are donor–acceptor (D–A)- or donor–acceptor–donor
(D–A–D)-type moieties, which give the bipolar characteristics
to a TADF molecule.7,11 Several approaches have been
studied to improve the host/guest concept in TADF emitters, although
the best framework can be emitter-dependent. Recently,16 was proposed that, if in a host/a guest system
based on a TADF dopant, the charge transport is via hole transport
in the TADF molecule and simultaneously the electron transport is
via the host molecule, therefore the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) levels of the host should be deeper than HOMO levels of TADF.
However, in all the host molecules, this is not the ideal case because
of p-type or n-type or bipolar characteristics of them, which can
change the entire characteristics of the device. Moreover, if the
(as typical) the electrical mobility of electrons and holes is clearly
distinct, the recombination region inside the EML will have a profile
in terms of location/width almost not ideal (i.e., near electrodes
and/or wide) with further decrease of efficiency and device lifetime/stability.
Another issue of TADF emitters is the well-known influence of the
host polarity in the emission not only shifting the main emission
but, particularly important, conditioning the efficiency. Other side,
ensuring high triplet of host and charge balance to boost efficient
energy transfer and reduce self-aggregation of TADF emitters, can
adopt a mixed host system. Recently, this concept has been used for
fabrication of blue and white OLEDs22 and
a mixed bipolar host for highly efficient OLEDs, exhibiting an external
quantum efficiency (EQE) of 18.86%.23 Nevertheless,
all of these such solutions, although important in the OLED design
structure, need to be adapted to the particular emitter. Without doubt,
the host concept is almost the main issue currently addressed in the
TADF emitters.

Following these concepts, we investigated OLEDs
based in a red-orange
TADF (TXO-TPA) with the mixed host of p-type matrix of PVK:mCP, where
the TADF is the D–A-type moiety. Our main idea is to obtain,
in a simple as the possible device structure, figures of merit that
should be compatible for the major usual applications.

To date,
many red-orange TADF emitters are reported for their use
in various applications such as bioimaging, sensors, telecommunications,
night vision, and so forth.3−5,7,11,24,25 At present, in the red-orange emitter (in some complex
device structures), EQE of nearly 30% is being recently reported,26,27 but compared with the blue and green TADF emitters reported earlier,
red TADF emitters are clearly underexplored by virtue of their nature
of nonradiative transition process and concentration quenching effect
induced by a strong donor–acceptor structure.11,17 Nevertheless, in high-efficient reported OLEDs, the final device
structure was very complex, sometimes with more than five organic
layers that are a technological constraint for practical applications.4,17,26−28 Therefore,
decreasing the red OLED structure complexity, but keeping a useful
efficiency, should be one of the fundamental keys for the larger production
and applications.29 This recognized as
one of the most problems in such red-orange emitters when attempts
to reduce device complexity are made. Additionally, the development
of a TADF-based OLED in a simple process requires a selection of suitable
host and charge transporting materials. Most of these choices relies
in the organic layer thickness optimization (depending on the electrical
carriers mobility and final device resistance) and the doping concentrations
of the TADF to capitalize the potential of TADF by achieving good
recombination.11,30 To extract the best performance
from the TADF-based EML, it is necessary to ensure the balance charge
carriers and exciton confinement in it. A balanced charge carrier
and recombination zone in TADF-based OLEDs are very sensitive to the
organic layer thickness and mobility of carriers in the EML, which
should be improved for better device characteristics enhancement.10,31 In this framework, the properties of electron transport layer (ETL)
are also crucial for the better charge transport and recombination
zone confinement in the device.32

Although the best electrical figures of merit for any organic layer
can be achieved using controlled thermal evaporation methods, this
technique suffers of several limitation to improve the host properties.
Therefore, solution process fabrication of OLEDs appears as very interesting
technique because of the higher degree of physical modulation of the
electrical properties. Moreover, it is an extremely rapidly evolving
technology for both the display and lightning industry.7,33 The choice of fabrication process had driven the research in OLEDs
with an aim to maximize the use of materials. Using a vacuum thermal
evaporation process, the method involves a more complex device structure
for efficient charge carrier transport and charge carrier balance,
which consequences a high cost for large area fabrication.7,34,35 Solution process methods, such
as spin-coating, roll-to-roll process, and screen printing, can be
adopted low-cost large-area fabrication.36,37 At present, an EQE of 31% in solution-processed OLEDs is reported
but the device composed of double hole-transport layer with cross-linkable
polymers and had a much complex multilayer device structure.8 Although interesting, the structure complexity
is too high for large-area applications but shows the concept. On
other side, some recent works on both solution and thermally processed
TADF OLEDs summarized recent advancements on such processes but they
fail to deliver effective charge-transport properties and recombination
profile inside EML.3,4,10,13,38 In solution
process technology, the effect of the thickness of EML and ETL is
underestimated and not much explored.

In this study, we develop
a simple structured OLED with a mixed
host consisting of a polymer PVK and a high triplet (2.9 eV) p-type
mCP for the red-orange TXO-TPA OLED, in a conventional p–n
two-layer structure. This structure exhibits a maximum EQE of 9.75%.
This emitter exhibits a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield
of 83% in 5 wt % TXO-TPA:mCP thin film. This TADF was first reported
by Wang et al. in 2014, with an EQE of 18.5% in a thermally vacuum-deposited
device28 although no attempt to build a
less complex structure based on a solution-processed EML was reported.
However, in thermally vacuum-deposited OLEDs, the device structure
was complex and so it is worthy to consider its solution-processed
counterpart with a relatively simple device structure, in which, although
a decrease in the maximum EQE, it is possible to keep the efficiencies
in a useful and practical range. Therefore, in the present work, we
focused in low complexity of the fabricated device structure, easy
to control the fabrication parameters including the control of the
doping with a well-balanced device in terms of the overall figure
of merits, and the formation of the recombination region near EML/ETL
interface. The OLEDs were fabricated with different doping concentrations
of TADF, that is, 5, 8, and 10 wt % and different ETL layer thicknesses.
These variations on device performance will be discussed, allowing
a better understanding of the host/guest concept for efficient balanced
TADF-based OLEDs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Photophysical Characterization and Film Morphology
Figure 1a,b shows
the molecular structures of the materials and the energy level diagram.
The TXO-TPA UV–vis absorption and PL spectra are shown in Figure 1c,d. Figure 1c shows the absorption spectra
of TXO-TPA in solid-state and toluene solution. The absorption spectra
of D–A molecule show a major peak at 420 nm which is assigned
to CT absorption mainly associated with electron transport from the
TPA moiety to TXO moiety, and additional peaks at 350, 300, and 250
nm clearly reflect the sum of TXO and TPA moieties.
The emission spectra have a maximum at 590 nm in toluene and are red-shifted
to 650 nm in the thin film as previously observed28 and may because of aggregation-induced emission (AIE).
The absolute fluorescence quantum yield (ΦPL) is
40%. However, in nonpolar rigid media Zeonex, this red-orange emitter
showed blue-shifted emission at 500 nm, which can be explained by
an excited state with a strong 1π–π*
character. Such a rigid chromic effect suggests a strong intramolecular
CT character 1CT of emissive state (Figure 1d).39 TXO-TPA
has T1 = 2.46 eV excited states with the lower energy gap
between S1 and T1 (ΔEST = 0.09 eV). Earlier, PVK has been used as a host material
because of its high triplet (T1 = 3.0 eV) energies,40,41 but the low hole and electron mobilities (10–6 and 10–9 cm2 V–1 s–1 respectively)42 and high
triplet–triplet annihilation effect does not make it a suitable
host for TADF.43 Thus, a blended system
of PVK:mCP was chosen for EML, where the high hole mobility (10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1)44 and a high triplet of mCP (together
also the high T1 level of PVK) enable the mixed p-type
host system for TADF doping and use in OLEDs. The HOMO and lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of TXO-TPA are 5.4 and
3.5 eV, respectively, as previously determined in ref (28). Therefore, the HOMO level
of mCP is much deeper than TXO-TPA (6.1 eV), whereas the LUMO level
of mCP is 2.4 eV is relatively near the LUMO of TmPyPb (2.7 eV). It
is anticipated that a wider band gap and a deeper HOMO of host materials
are considered best for better carrier confinements, balance the electron
transport, and control of the exciton formation mechanism.45,46

(d) PL spectra of TXO-TPA in Zeonex, pristine film, 8 wt % TXO-TPA
in PVK:mCP, and in toluene solution.

As previously assumed,31 it is consistent
to consider that the HOMO level of the active layer should correspond
to the deeper HOMO level of the p-type material, and the LUMO level
should be considered the highest of the active layer (in this case
and fro both situations, the mCP). With these assumptions, we expect
a hole-blocking barrier at the EML/TmPyPB interface. To estimate the
electrical carrier mobility, Liu et al.47 demonstrated a power dependence on the concentration of the individual
materials in the matrix and consider that an electrical carrier in
the matrix has the mobility that can be given by , where 1, 2, ..., m corresponds
to the different materials, and C is their individual
concentration in the host/guest matrix, where C1 + C2 + ... + Cm = 1. The expression is valid for both
electrons and holes.

To compare the surface morphology and effect
of TADF doping on
thin-film formation, spin-coated thin films of PVK:mCP with 5, 8,
and 10 wt % TXO-TPA were prepared in chlorobenzene (CB) of 50 nm thickness
on the ITO substrate. The importance of such morphology is the relationship
with device optic-electrical characteristics as it is known that intrinsic
defects arising from low structural molecular conformation give rise
to electrically active energy levels that can act as traps for electrical
carriers, changing, in a noticeable way, the electrical mobility and
exciton recombination profile and density. Figure 2 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images of films for 5, 8, and 10 wt % in CB. The root-mean-square
roughness was 0.40, 0.32, and 1.02 nm. The uniformity of films obtained
using CB as a solvent is clearly high. No noticeable aggregations
were observed in thin films of EML.

2.2 Carrier-Transport Properties
As previously
mentioned, the electrical properties of the host are determinant for
the OLED behavior. Among all, electrical mobility can be critical.
In order to evaluate the carrier-transporting and charge balance properties,
hole-only and electron-only devices with EML only, were fabricated.
For hole-only devices, a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/EML (50
nm)/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/Al (100 nm) was used, and for the electron-only
device, the structure was ITO/LiF (2 nm)/EML (50 nm)/LiF (2 nm)/Al
(100 nm). Figure 3 shows
the I–V characteristics of
all the wt % devices for both hole- and electron-only devices. The
electrical mobility for majority carrier in each kind of device can
be estimated by the I–V behavior
under the Mott–Gurney I–V model.29 In this model, , where A, ε, d, and μeff are the OLED active area, electrical
permittivity (assuming as usual that the relative electrical permittivity
for organic semiconductors is around 3), the film thickness, and the
effective mobility (Poole–Frenkel mobility affected by the
density of traps), respectively.

Figure 3 I–V characteristics of
hole-only devices and electron-only devices for 5, 8, and 10 wt %
of TXO-TPA in the PVK:mCP host matrix. The dashed lines show the I ∝ V2.

In this space charge current limit (SCLC) model, we can extract
the electrical mobility where the applied voltage range follows the
Mott–Gurney model. For relatively low applied voltage (∼4
V) and for n-type device (electrons), we found μe ≈ 1.58 × 10–7, 9.63 × 10–7, and 1.23 × 10–6 cm2 V–1 s–1 for TADF concentration
of 5, 8, and 10 wt %, respectively, whereas for hole mobility, we
have μp ≈ 4.43 × 10–4, 4.12 × 10–4, and 3.79 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1, for
the same TADF concentration, respectively. These values are in line,
with some deviations but in the same order of magnitude, with the
expected from the mixed electrical mobility as previously explained.
Increasing applied voltage, the mobilities tend to increase (Poole–Frenkel
mobility dependence with electrical field) but in a short voltage
range, the changes are not noticeable. Under high-applied voltages,
Mott–Gurney models are no longer applied (deep traps). We should
note that whereas μe increases with TADF concentration,
the opposite occurs for μp. Moreover, the relative
low μe in the active layer is almost dependent on
the low μe of PVK. Increasing mCP concentration,
should improve the electron mobility in EML but the film becomes very
inhomogeneous. A compromise was obtained.

2.3 Device
Characteristics
All the molecules
PVK, mCP, and TXO-TPA have good solubility in CB. The deposition parameters
were optimized to maximize device performance. Here, TmPyPB was used
as the electron-transport material because of its high electron mobility
of 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 and a high triplet of 2.8 eV.48Figure 4 shows the current density–voltage–luminescence, EL
spectrum, and efficiencies (current efficiency ηC, power efficiency ηP and EQE) results obtained
for device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/EML (40 nm)/TmPyPb (30
nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm).

nm): (a) current density–voltage–brightness curves,
(b) EQE–brightness curves, (c) current efficiency–power

The turn-on voltage (VON) of the devices
was 6 V for 5 wt % OLED and 5 V for the 8 and 10 wt % OLEDs. In the
first observation, the lower VON can be
ascribed to a simultaneous effect of electrical carrier mobility and
organic thickness layers that will promote high density of excitons
at low electrical field although not optimized as the low efficiencies
show. The device with all wt % of TXO-TPA exhibited a low EQE in the
range of 3–3.5%. The maximum ηC was 6.60 cd/A
and ηP was 3.46 lm/W for 5 wt %. The device emits
a red-orange EL peak with 554 nm, which is independent of the driving
voltage, corresponding to the emission of TXO-TPA emitter. Another
peak at 625 was also observed because of AIE of TXO-TPA as previously
explained.28 An additional weak peak around
400 was observed and is attributed to the emission from PVK. The intensity
of this PVK emission is less than 2% of the integrated intensity from
the EL spectra. No significant change in the CIE coordinates was observed
because of the PVK emission. Moreover, the emission tends to decrease
upon increasing the doping concentration of the TADF. Although, from
the energy level diagram, we do not expect the presence of any PVK
emission, and this is unusual because of the interactions in the host/guest
between the emitter and PVK during the process of energy transfer
that should occurs. The Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage
(CIE) coordinates were (0.44, 0.51). The results are summarized in Table 1.

In the EL spectra of all the devices, a redshift was observed upon
increasing the TADF concentration that is usual.49 At a lower thickness of TmPyPb (30 nm), the efficiency
is low and this ascribed to the asymmetric hole/electron density profile
and, thus the recombination zone moves toward the anode interface50 with further decreasing of the recombination
probability.

When the thickness of the ETL was increased to
40 and 50 nm, the
device characteristics were improved by almost two-three folds. The VON was identical to the device with 30 nm ETL.
Also, there was no further change in CIE coordinates observed in all
the devices. In a simple explanation, VON depends on the transition from ohmic to space charge region that,
by turn, depends on the carrier densities and electrical mobility.
Considering that our host/guest EML still being equal in all device
structures, only small changes in VON are
expected (in the layer thickness range probed). Therefore, we should
focus more in the electrical carrier/exciton profiles in EML. The
device with 40 nm ETL exhibited improved EQE of 3.67, 5.71, and 5.80%
for 5, 8, and 10 wt % doping (Figure 5). The results are summarized in Table 2. The CIE color coordinates are around (0.45,
0.51).

The maximum ηC was 11.36 cd/A and ηP was 7.13 lm/W for 8 wt %. This improvement in the device
is attributed because of the better confinement of the recombination
zone upon increasing the ETL that, according to the electrical carrier
mobility, will change the electrical carrier profile.50 The devices exhibited EL bands peaked at 563, 563, and
574 nm for 5, 8, and 10 wt %, respectively. Similar discussions carried
out about EL bands are still valid.

The best results were obtained
with the device with an ETL of 50
nm in a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/EML (40 nm)/TmPyPb (50
nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Figure 6). In this device, we obtain an EQE of 6.02, 9.75,
and 5.33% for 5, 8, and 10 wt % doping, respectively. The CIE color
coordinates do not change significantly, with the average values of
(0.45, 0.51). The results are summarized in Table 3.

The maximum ηC was 19.36 cd/A and ηP was 12.17 lm/W and Lmax of 2200
cd/m2 for 8 wt %. As an interesting point, the brightness
values were obtained measuring only the normal emission, without using
an integrating sphere. The EL spectra maximum were at 561, 561, and
574 nm for 5, 8, and 10 wt %. In a 50 nm thick ETL device, owing to
the superior exciton confinement in EML and charge balance, the device
performance enhanced threefold compared to the 30 and 40 nm thick
ETL devices. In general, the current density values in 50 nm devices
are lower than those with 30 and 40 nm. The higher current density
values observed in the 30 nm-based devices are attributed to the leakage
of the electrons in EML because of poor charge balance and thus yielded
the reduced efficiencies.51,52 The luminescence is
also poor in the 30 nm device, which exhibited a reduction of the
excitons recombination.

Considering PEDOT:PSS as a metal-like
polymer, employed to optimize
the hole injection at the anode, in a similar way to use LiF dielectric
for cathode injection optimization, by reducing the respective potential
barriers, we can assume that our device is a “two-layer”
structure model. In such simple two-organic layer type structure (EML/ETL),
in general, the mobility of the electrons in the ETL is lower than
the hole mobility in EML, and for a better exciton formation and confinement,
this mobility matching is prerequisite irrespective of the ETL thickness.
The electrical mobilities determined under space charge conditions,
match this assumption, at least by approximation. Following the previously
mentioned empirical model from Liu et al. for mixed electrical mobility
of a mixed organic layer, and assuming that the electron mobility
of pure mCP is around 10–5 to 10–6 cm2 V–1 s–1, we expect
μe and μp only for the host in the
order of 10–8 and 10–6 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively.
Such values are considerably low (near one order of magnitude) than
the values calculated under space charge conditions and far from the
condition abovementioned. Nevertheless, although in relatively small
concentration, the TXO-TPA emitter strongly influences the overall
mobility in EML. Increasing the TADF concentration, μe tends to increase and the opposite happens with μp. An optimal framework can be, therefore, obtained. Hence, finding
the optimum device thickness for both EML and ETL, according to the
charge carrier mobilities, is essential.53 The results presented in Figure 6 clearly show that a thin EML of 50 nm leads to a stable
and efficient device with an EQE of 9.75%. In this way, and considering
the overall electrical carriers mobilities previously indicated, we
can expect (from the EML mixed mobilities) that an increase on ETL
should lead to a more symmetrical and narrow, near EML/ETL interface,
and electron/hole density profile in the active layer contributing
for a better result. Because of high electron mobility in TmPyPb,
and because a potential barrier for holes exists in the EML/ETL, increasing
the ETL layer thickness leads to a more electrically balanced device.
It is know that, the exciton recombination efficiency is dependent
on the width of the recombination region. As thinner will be such
region, higher recombination probability can be obtained.27 Our results can be explained on base of this
model, in the sequence above discussed.

Thus, the proposed device
structure provides simultaneously a:
(i) facilitated enhanced electron injection into EML and hole accumulation
at the ETL/EML interface for better hole–electron charge balance
in EML; (ii) block of exciton by p-type mCP with high charge mobilities
and triplet level in a simplified structure; (iii) good match of HOMO
levels of TXO-TPA (5.4 eV) with anode work function (5.3 eV) that
also reduces the hole accumulation at the anode/EML interface for
better charge balance in EML, and (iv) optimized thickness of ETL
that provides adequate charge balance and exciton confinement in EML,
further increase to the overall device performance.

Naturally
that the simplified structure used cannot allow a very
high EQE but with the best result obtained, the values are clear in
the range of practical applications. The main idea to overcome the
pronounceable decrease of efficiencies is to achieve an optimized
charge profile density in the active layer that can compensate for
the aforementioned problem with an increase of radiative transitions
because of the symmetrical recombination density profile obtained.
In this work, we show that such possibility can be achieved with interesting
results. The very simple device structure (in practice only two organic
layer structure) is a surplus for suitable applications, opening,
therefore, a field of TADF-based OLEDs that can be further explored.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a
simple, essentially two-layer device
structure, for the red-orange TXO-TPA emitter used as a guest in a
p-type host matrix deposited by solution-processed. The device was
optimized with the thickness of the ETL of 50 nm, in order to achieve
the best exciton recombination profile. The red-orange OLED with TXO-TPA
exhibits the maximum EQE of 9.75%, ηC of 19.36 cd/A,
and ηP was 12.17 lm/W for 8 wt % of the emitter in
the host. The CIE color coordinates of (0.45; 0.51) are practically
constant in all devices independently of the emitter concentration
and of the applied voltage. These results are the best obtained based
on TXO-TPA by solution-processed. This work can influence the use
of the red-orange TADF emitters for large-area display and lighting
applications.

4 Materials and Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
TXO-TPA, PVK, and mCP were
obtained from Lumtec Corp. 1,3,5-Tri(m-pyridin-3-ylphenyl)benzene
(TmPyPB), poly(styrenesulfonate)-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT:PSS), and LiF were obtained from Ossila Ltd. All solvents were
bought from Sigma-Aldrich. The patterned ITO substrates (resistivity
of 20 Ω/□) were bought from Ossila Ltd. All organic materials
were sublimed before use.

4.2 Device Fabrication
The simple device
structure was ITO (100 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/EML (40 nm)/ETL (Y nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), where Y =
30, 40, and 50 nm. EML, was [PVK:mCP](100–a):TXO-TPAa, where a was the wt % of the TADF emitter dopant in the host PVK:mCP (0.70:0.30
in wt %). The substrates were first cleaned in an ultrasonic bath
containing 2% v/v Hellmanex solution in water and then in acetone
and 2-propanol (IPA). After solvent cleaning, the substrates were
UV ozone treated for 5 min. The PEDOT:PSS was filtered with a 0.45
μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter. The PEDOT:PSS layer
was spin-cast at 2000 rpm and annealed at 120 °C for 15 min.
The EML [PVK:mCP](100–a):TXO-TPAa layer (CB solvent) was spin-coated at 2000
rpm after being filtered using a 0.1 μm polytetrafluoroethylene
filter and dried in the glovebox at 80 °C for 30 min. The ETL
of TmPyPb (with different thickness), the LiF (1 nm) dielectric layer,
and the Al (100 nm) metal layer were deposited in a vacuum, at pressure
<5 × 10–6 mbar. The rate for organic material
deposition was 1, 0.1 Å/s for LiF, and 3–5 Å/s for
Al. The device active area is 4.5 mm2. The devices were
characterized in the ambient atmosphere without any encapsulation.
The OLEDs, initially at 100 cd/m2, exhibited a total loss
of 10% after 5 h, and after 6–7 h, the total loss in luminance
was 60%. This behavior is usually found in nonencapsulated devices.

4.3 Optical, Electrical, and Morphological Measurement
The current–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characteristics
were determined using a Keithley source meter 2425 model and a Minolta
LS-100 Chromameter. For the EL spectra measurement, an Ocean Optics
USB4000 spectrometer was used with the sensitivity response in the
wavelength range 350–950 nm. PL spectra of studied samples
in toluene were performed at room temperature with an Edinburgh Instruments
FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer with an Xe-lamp as an excitation
source and R-928 photomultiplier detector. The morphological characterizations
were obtained by the Park Systems XE7 Atomic force microscope.
