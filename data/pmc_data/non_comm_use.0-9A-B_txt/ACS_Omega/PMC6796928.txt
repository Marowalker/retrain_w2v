Subsequently, engines are designed
to operate at low viscosity
engine oils. Low viscosity oils take less power from engines, bring
down the internal drag, cut the fuel consumption, and ultimately improve
the engine’s efficiency. Considering this focus, an approach
has been made to formulate a multiwalled carbon nanotube based green
tea and polyaniline nanocomposite, that is, GT/MWCNT/PANI, and incorporate
it in engine oil (base fluid). The objective was to reduce the viscosity
of engine oil by examining the effects of the constant shear rate
and varying shear rates on the viscosity of Castrol class 15W-40 engine
oil. The investigation was performed at a constant temperature of
25 °C for a fixed volume fraction of 0.1% GT/MWCNT/PANI in engine
oil on the experimental setup rheometer from Anton Paar Series. Primordial
findings revealed that, at a constant shear rate of 100 s–1, engine oil viscosity was lowered from 0.221000 to 0.001402 Pa·s,
that is, 99% reduction in viscosity of the engine oil, after incorporating
the GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite. Furthermore, a new correlation has
been proposed considering the experimental and theoretical models
with an average percentage error of 0.040%. Also, at varying shear
rates, up to 90 s–1, the shear viscosity of nanofluid
decreases significantly, leading to shear-thinning behavior of the
nanofluid, while at a shear rate of >90 s–1,
it
shows Newtonian behavior. Besides, the ternary nanocomposite with
0.2 wt % GT/MWCNT/PANI also showed significant bactericidal effects
with the zones of inhibition of 19, 18, and 15 mm against Gram-negative
(Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria, respectively, as
measured using the well diffusion method.

Introduction
The past decade has
recorded a rapid development of nanofluids
(NF) science in many facets. Innumerable studies are focusing on the
thermal conductivities of these fluids. NF viscosity is a less researched
area and deserves the same attention as thermal conductivity. Since
engines are designed to operate at low viscosity, reducing the NF
viscosity of engine oils becomes one of the most required areas of
study to reduce frictional losses in engines and to cut the fuel cost.
A survey suggested that the market share of lower viscosity oils (10W-30
oils) will grow from about 6 to roughly 20% by 2022.1

Asadi et al. investigated NFs for the first time
as a suspension
of nanosized particles in conventional fluids: water, ethylene glycol,
propylene glycol, oil, and so on.2 To the best of our knowledge collected,
examples of the nanoparticles (NPs) used in preparing nanofluids until
now are pure metals (Au, Ag, Cu, and Fe), oxides of metals (ZnO, TiO2, Mg(OH)2, Fe3O4, Al2O3, SiO2, CuO), and different types
of allotropes of carbon (graphite, diamond, carbon nanotubes, graphene).1−5 The small size of NPs has solved issues like corrosion of fluids,
impurity, and pressure drop and ultimately modified the properties
of the base fluids exhibiting high thermal conductivity, tunable surface
tension, and improved rheology.6,7

Over the last
decade, rheology of carbon nanotube (CNT) suspension
has been under in-depth study.1−3,8 The
first steady shear experiment on a CNT/polymer nanocomposite was reported
by Safadi et al.,9 where MWNTs were dispersed
in toluene and the resulting suspensions were mixed with toluene solutions
of 30 wt % polystyrene. The viscosities of the mixtures with various
MWNT contents were measured at room temperature over a range of shear
rates. Around the same time, Kinloch et al. reported the experimental rheology results for concentrated aqueous
CNT dispersions, covering the steady shear, linear viscoelasticity
(LVE), and recovery after pre-shear behavior of these dispersions.
Bagheri and Nadooshan investigated the thermal conductivity coefficient
of the composite ZnO/MWCNT into water/ethylene glycol nanofluids.10 The thermal conductivity of the NF showed a
30% increase over the base fluid (bf). Pötschke et al. reported
their work on rheological properties of CNT/thermoplastic systems
from the Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Germany.11

Rheological studies of CNT based NFs demand
a homogeneous suspension.
The preparation of a homogeneous CNT suspension still appears to be
a complicated thing.12,13 CNTs have the property of agglomeration
due to van der Waals forces, and mechanically mixing CNTs into a liquid
does not produce a homogeneous suspension.16 Several studies have been done regarding this issue by Sinija and
Mishra,16 Shinde and Kher,17 and Chen et al.18 The formation of a homogeneous suspension of CNT includes separating
individual CNTs from the bundles, stabilizing the DE bundled CNTs
to prevent reaggregation. High-shear mechanical mixing and sonication
are two of the most common methods for dispersing CNTs into a suspending
medium having a relatively low viscosity.12−14 Dispersion
by sonication relies on cavitation (the implosion of small bubbles
generated in the suspending medium) occurring within the sample.14 The influence of prolonged sonication on the
length of CNTs has been reported in the literature.19 The critical point is that, for fixed sonication conditions,
there exists a limiting length beyond which the CNTs will not be further
shortened. Huang and Terentjev14 constructed
a simple model to calculate the limiting length; theoretically, there
should be an optimal sonication condition (in terms of sonication
power, frequency, and time) that would allow the dispersion of CNTs
without shortening their lengths significantly. The literature reports
convey that dispersion state, aspect ratio, suspension medium concentration,
and chemical treatments are some of the parameters that affect the
rheology of CNT composite suspensions.15

Despite that, only recently, scientists have found green tea
(GT)
to be famous in the production of nanocomposites. GT is majorly composed
of a polyphenolic compound catechin, which is regarded as an active
reducing agent due to its ability to donate an electron or hydrogen
atom easily. The four primary catechins found in green tea are (−)-epicatechin
(EC), (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (−)-epigallocatechin
(EGC), and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).16 Also, polyaniline (PANI), a conducting polymer,
possesses fascinating properties. It has a flexible −NH–
group in the polymeric chain hanged on both sides of the phenylene
ring responsible for all the physical and chemical properties of PANI.17 These properties like conductivity, magnetic,
optical, and other features of PANI change depending on its oxidation
state and degree of protonation and doping. Preparing composites with
PANI is a smart way to improve the conductivity of conducting polymers.
Much work has been already done on the synthesis and characterization
of CNT/PANI based nanocomposites showing applications in the environmental
and biological fields.17,18

In the present study, a
GT/MWCNT/PANI is prepared and incorporated
in engine oil (bf) with the aim to reduce the viscosity of engine
oil. Low viscosity oils take less power from engines, bring down the
friction, cut the fuel consumption, and ultimately improve the engine’s
efficiency. By examining the effects of the constant shear rate (100
s–1) and varying shear rates (0–500 s–1) on the viscosity of Castrol class 15W-40 engine
oil, the viscosity is found to diminish by 99% (i.e., from 0.221000
to 0.001402 Pa·s) on incorporating the GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite
into the engine oil, which is a much higher reduction percentile as
compared to the already reported nanocomposites as presented in Table 1. A new correlation has been proposed considering the experimental
and theoretical models with an average percentage error of 0.040%.
Also, at varying shear rates, up to 90 s–1, the
shear viscosity of NF is found to decrease significantly, leading
to shear-thinning behavior of the NF, while at a shear rate of >90
s–1, it showed Newtonian behavior. Additionally,
the ternary nanocomposite with 0.2 wt % GT/MWCNT/PANI also showed
significant bactericidal effects with the zones of inhibition of 19,
18, and 15 mm against Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa, E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria, respectively, as measured using
the well diffusion method.

Results and Discussion
A GT/MWCNT/PANI ternary nanocomposite was successfully synthesized
using the sol–gel technique. An ultrasonic processor (Figure S1, Supporting Information) was used for
the proper dispersion of MWCNT, a challenging step.

Morphological Accountancy
Using Scanning Electron Microscopy
Figure 1a–c
illustrates the SEM micrographs of the GT extract at different resolutions
(Table S2, Supporting Information). Figure 1a,b shows irregular
morphology of GT NPs having a range of 3–20 μm. They
have no distinct shapes, and somewhat entangled surface structures
of GT fibers are visible in Figure 1a.19,20Figure 1c reveals the open stomata structure of GT
NPs with diameters of 1–10 μm, similar to the case reported
in the literature.19Figure 1d–f illustrates the surface structure
of the GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite where MWCNT surfaces are coated
with GT NPs in the PANI matrix.21,22 From the figure, it
is clear that GT NPs were found to have adhered to the surface of
the nanotubes. Since GT contains numerous polyphenols, noncovalent
interaction between MWCNTs and polyphenols by π–π
dispersive interactions is believed to cause separation of the nanotube
bundles through sonication and adhesion of GT NPs on the tube surfaces
of MWCNT.22 Besides, aniline is polymerized
and aggregated in between the wedges of MWCNTs as well as on the tube
surfaces. The groovy tubular structures of MWNTs are dispersed in
the PANI matrix. PANI macromolecules can also be absorbed in the surface
of MWNTs, forming a sandwiched structure of the nanocomposite. It
should be observed from Figure S3 (Supporting
Information) that, after functionalization of MWCNT, smooth surfaces
became rough and reactive though no structural damage or shortening
length was reported. This may be due to the mild condition of an aqueous
acid solution.23 SEM images at different
magnifications also confirm the amorphous morphology of the composite.24

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopic Studies
The
spectral studies of the GT/MWCNT/PANI composite (heated at 140 °C
for 20 min) shown in Figure 2 indicate the appearance of the band at around 3221 cm–1 representing the −NH stretching mode of aromatic
amines24 and the band at 3054 cm–1 attributed to the carboxylic acid (−OH stretching) vibration
band.25 Peaks in the region of 2925–2853
cm–1 belong to asymmetric/symmetric (methylene stretching)
bands, which explains that the surfaces of MWCNT are coated with GT
NPs in the matrix of PANI.24 One weak peak
appearing around 1690 cm–1 is ascribed to the presence
of the C=O stretching mode of the −COOH group. This particular
peak appears after functionalization through acid reflux only.23 Also, characteristic absorption bands at around
1568 and 1495 cm–1 are attributed to quinonoid and
benzenoid rings of PANI, respectively.24 Moreover, peaks around 1302 and 1240 cm–1 represent
the −C=N stretching modes of secondary aromatic amines. The
sharp peak at around 1145 cm–1 is the characteristic
band of the protonated form of PANI, which is a measure of delocalized
of π electrons.21,22 The wavenumbers at around 879
and 1042 cm–1 correspond to −C–H alkene
and −C–O alcohols representing the presence of catechin.26,27 The weak peaks appearing at 617 and 691 cm–1 are
−N–H wags due to the presence of primary and secondary
amines.

Thermal Behavior
The pyrolysis curves of GT and GT/MWCNT/PANI
nanocomposite are shown in Figure 3. The GT underwent one-step thermal degradation, which
starts at a temperature of >200 °C with a significant weight
loss of 74%.26,28

Figure 3 TGA of green tea (GT) and GT/MWCNT/PANI
composite.

On the contrary, a four-stage
weight loss was observed from the
TGA curve of the GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite. The first minor weight
loss occurred in the temperature range of 70–190 °C, which
may be due to the vaporization of moisture from PANI.28 The second and third weight losses of 12% each were observed
at temperatures of 220 and 373–500 °C, respectively. These
weight losses were found to be associated with the degradation of
GT. This result indicates a higher number of reactive sites for oxidation
in the GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite as compared to the nonconjugated
CNTs due to the presence of GT elements.29 The fourth weight loss that occurred in the temperature range of
500–684 °C was due to the thermal degradation of the nanocomposite.30 These observations indicated the higher stability
of the GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite over the parental counterparts,
GT and PANI. This higher stability is maybe because of the absorption
of free radicals (generated during the decomposition of GT and PANI)
on the surfaces of MWCNT.

Study of Rheological Responses
The
effects of the constant
shear rate (100 s–1) and varying shear rates (0–500
s–1) on the viscosity of NFs are discussed in this
section. The viscosity of Castrol class 15W-40 engine oil, which did
not contain the nanocomposite as measured using a rheometer from Anton
Paar Series, was 0.221 Pa·s. Also, the viscosity of the GT/MWCNT/PANI
in bf engine oil was measured at constant and varying shear rates. Figure 4 shows the variation
of viscosity in the NF with time at a constant shear rate of 100 s–1. The values indicate that there is a decrease in
viscosity up to 50 s, and then later, it becomes constant. An attempt
was made to develop a theoretical model of viscosity variation with
time as given in eq 1 1  where A1
= 0.00008, A2 = 12.02141, η is viscosity (Pa·s),
and T is time (s).

Figure 4 Viscosity variation of GT/MWCNT/PANI in
15W-40 engine oil (base
fluid) with time at a constant shear rate of 100 s–1.

The comparative account of experimental
and theoretical models
is presented in Figure 5, representing the average percentage error calculated to be 0.04041%. Figure 6 shows the effect
of the shear rate on viscosity of the NF. We observe from the plot
that, on the addition of GT/MWCNT/PANI into the engine oil, there
is an abrupt decrease in viscosity with the increase in shear rate
(up to 90 s–1). This decreasing trend of viscosity
as a function of increasing shear rates is due to the shear-thinning
behavior of the NF. From the figure, we can see that, at low shear
rate values, that is, up to 90 s–1, the NF is showing
shear-thinning behavior.31,32 This significant behavior
may be shown to be due to the interconnection of CNT aggregates within
their suspensions. The liquid near these aggregates is found to be
less mobile. As a result, the nanofluid becomes more viscous. As the
shear rate increases, these aggregates break into smaller or primary
structures. A certain amount of immobilized liquid will be released,
causing a decrease in viscosity leading to shear-thinning behavior
in NFs. At shear rates of >90 s–1, there is no
change
in viscosity of the NF; it may be due to the complete removal of solvated
layers at a higher shear rate value of 90 s–1.8 Since the variations of the viscosity with respect
to the shear rate are negligible, it can be concluded that the studied
NF becomes Newtonian fluid at shear rates of >90 s–1.8,33

Bactericidal Efficacy
The bactericidal efficacy of
the nanocomposite was evaluated against Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa, E. coli) bacteria by the agar well
diffusion method. Briefly, the discs were placed on the agar plates,
and various concentrations of GT/MWCNT/PANI samples suspended in 25%
DMSO (used as a negative control) were pipetted onto filter discs. Figure 7 shows typical results
of antibacterial percent present in the GT and GT/MWCNT/PANI on S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa (ESBL). The antibacterial
activity of the synthesized composites was evaluated by measuring
the zone of growth inhibition against the test microbes. ZOI details
are mentioned in Table 2. The nanocomposite (0.25wt % GT/MWCNT/PANI) showed bacterial efficacies
of 19, 18, and 15 mm with Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli), respectively. Figure 8 shows the 3D bar
charts representing the antibacterial potential of samples against
bacterial isolates belonging to genera Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) as measured by the well
diffusion test.34,35

Conclusions
A ternary nanocomposite GT/MWCNT/PANI was synthesized using a sol–gel
approach. The effect of changes on the rheological behavior of hybrid
nanofluid (NF) GT/MWCNT/PANI-15W-40 was investigated. The effect of
constant and varying shear rates was studied. Results revealed that
the shear rate, as an independent parameter, plays a vital role in
the prediction of viscosity. At a constant shear rate of 100 s–1, viscosity was reduced by 99% from 0.2210 to 0.001402
Pa·s. At varying shear rates, up to 90 s–1,
the shear viscosity of NF decreases significantly, leading to shear-thinning
behavior of the NF, while at a shear rate of >90 s–1, it shows Newtonian behavior. Besides, the ternary nanocomposite
with 0.2 wt % GT/MWCNT/PANI also showed significant bactericidal effects
with ZOIs of 19, 18, and 15 mm against Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa, E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria,
respectively, as measured using the well diffusion method.

Experimental
Section
Materials Used
Merck supplied the monomer, aniline,
and KPS (potassium persulfate) used in the study. Carbon nanotubes
(MWCNT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. These MWCNTs had a length
of 20 μm, an outer diameter of 10–20 nm, and an inner
diameter of 2–6 nm, and an aspect ratio of 1000. Green tea
(brand name Lipton) was purchased from a market in India. The experimental
material for rheological activity was Castrol engine oil class 15W-40.
All the solutions were made using double distilled water during the
synthesis.

Modification of MWCNT
Functionalization
was done with
3:1 solution of 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M HNO3, which was then ultrasonicated for 15 min, filtered using a centrifuge,
and dried for 24 h at 60 °C giving a black powdered functionalized
MWCNT.36,37

GT Sample Preparation and Composite Formation
GT leaves
were crushed under a mortar, and 2 g of crushed powder was added in
100 mL of DMW. It was kept for boiling.38,39 The filtrate of GT was then kept for further steps. Then 0.15 g
of MWCNT was added to 100 mL of GT filtrate and kept for ultrasonication
for 30 min. As a result of sonication, a GT/MWCNT composite with 0.15
g of MWCNT was synthesized. Similarly, 0.25 g of MWCNT was added to
another 100 mL of GT filtrate and sonicated for 30 min yielding the
MWCNT/GT composite with 0.25 g of MWCNT.28

Polymerization
1 mL of aniline was added dropwise to
the GT/MWCNT suspension/binary composite, which was further sonicated
for 20 min, and then 50 mL of potassium persulfate (KPS) solution
prepared in 1 M aqueous HCl was added dropwise to the suspension,
stirred at 10 to −5 °C in an ice bath (2 h), then filtered
using a centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 15 min, and washed several times
with double-distilled ethanol. The sample was dried for 24 h at 60
°C leading to the formation of the required ternary nanocomposite
(i.e., GT/MWCNT/PANI).24

Characterization
SEM, FTIR, and TGA were used to analyze
the surface morphology, functional groups, and thermal studies of
the GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis was performed on LEO 435-VF to identify the surface morphology
of the synthesized nanocomposite. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrum was recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 2 Version 10.4.00
with KBr pellets in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 to identify the functional groups present in the synthesized GT/MWCNT/PANI
nanocomposite. A Shimadzu TGA Model 60 H recorded the thermal analysis
of the synthesized nanocomposite.

Preparation of Nanofluid
(NF) for Rheological Investigation
The above-synthesized
GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite powder was dispersed
in engine oil followed by 30 min of sonication using an ultrasonicator
(Figure S1, Supporting Information) yielding
NF. Rheological investigation was done on the prepared samples to
analyze the viscosity of the NF system with 0.1% volume fraction in
engine oil, first at a constant shear rate and then at varying shear
rates by using a modular compact rheometer from Anton Paar series
(MCR 102 SN 81270415 FW3.70) equipped with conical shaped geometry
having a diameter of 40 mm and an angle of 1°, at a fixed temperature
of 25 °C as shown in Figure S4 (Supporting
Information). A volume (0.15 mL) of the prepared solution was placed
on the measuring plate, and then the viscosity of the sample was measured.
The interaction between the base fluid (bf) and nanocomposite plays
a vital role in determining the rheological behavior of NF.

Bactericidal
Activity
The antibacterial activity of
the synthesized GT/MWCNT/PANI nanocomposite was tested against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus by the disc diffusion
method.34 A single colony of the composite
strain was inoculated in Luria Beltane’s (LP) broth under sterile
conditions and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Turbidity produced
against the negative control confirmed growth. A 0.1 mL (1 ×
107 cells/mL) fraction from culture was uniformly spread
on Luria agar plates. The zone of growth inhibition was determined
on 4 mm diameter wells cut on other plates.
