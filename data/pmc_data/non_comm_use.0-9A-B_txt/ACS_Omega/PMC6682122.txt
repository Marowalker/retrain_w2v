In this study, FeSO4·7H2O was used as
an auxiliary depressant to improve the selective depression effect
on fluorite. Microflotation tests using oleic acid as the collector
showed that the pre-addition of FeSO4·7H2O and subsequent addition of sodium silicate (SS) resulted in a stronger
selective depression effect on fluorite compared with SS alone. Addition
of FeSO4·7H2O reduced the required dosage
of SS and had little negative effects on scheelite recovery. The selective
depression mechanism of FeSO4·7H2O was
investigated in detail. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated
that the difference in the number of surface active sites was the
mechanism for improved differential flotation of scheelite from fluorite.
The improved depression of fluorite was attributed to both ferrous
and sulphate ions. The pre-adsorption of ferrous species increased
the number of active sites, enhancing the adsorption of silicate species
on the fluorite surface. Simultaneously, sulfate ions were selectively
adsorbed on the fluorite surface to form hydrophilic calcium sulfate,
reducing the floatability of fluorite.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Scheelite (CaWO4) is an important mineral for extracting
tungsten and usually associated with fluorite in Chinese scheelite
deposits.1,2 The utilization of refractory scheelite
deposits—wolframite resources that can be easily separated
via the gravity method and are almost depleted—has become important.
Conventional flotation practice for separating scheelite from fluorite
utilizes sodium silicate (SS) (water glass) to depress fluorite followed
by a fatty oil collector such as oleic acid to float scheelite. Similar
surface reactivity of these two minerals requires the use of a depressant
to enhance flotation selectivity.3−6 Therefore, these materials are almost impossible
to separate without a selective depressant.

Recently, depressants
such as organic colloids, sodium phosphates,
quebracho, and hydrosols have been used to separate scheelite from
fluorite.7,8 Water glass is the most widely used and
cheapest among these depressants.9 In practice,
it is found that a high water glass dosage is required to effectively
depress fluorite. However, this frequently results in simultaneous
depression of scheelite.10 A more selective
depressant, featuring low cost and dosage, is needed for the separation
of scheelite from fluorite. The depressant mixture is a good choice
for this specific goal. To enhance the separation efficiency, a mixture
of water glass with metal ions (such as Al3+, Fe2+, Pb2+, and Ca2+) have been used in scheelite
flotation.11−17 The depressant effect of the joint addition of SS and other salts
was first studied by Belash,18 and a number
of studies have since been done.19−21 The original study indicated
that these ions could promote the depression capability of water glass
in scheelite flotation systems. Oliveira and Sampaio first used FeSO4·7H2O as a depressant in scheelite flotation.22 The authors investigated the effect of a mixture
of SS with FeSO4·7H2O on the bench scale
for a scheelite ore from Brazil. The addition of SS and FeSO4·7H2O at a ratio of 5/1 resulted in substantially
increased selectivity. Recently, Deng et al. used this mixture depressant
to separate scheelite and calcite. The authors attributed the improved
depression effect to Fe2+, which facilitated the formation
of polymeric silicate species.23

Although there have been many studies on the effects of metal ions
on scheelite flotation, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear
and some even incompatible. In addition, the aforementioned studies
focused on only cations (Fe2+), ignoring the role of anions
(SO42–) on the separation of scheelite
from fluorite. In this study, FeSO4·7H2O was used as an assistant depressant in an attempt to selectively
separate scheelite from fluorite. The depression mechanism was revealed
by microflotation, zeta-potential measurements, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report on the effect of SO42– on the flotation separation of scheelite from fluorite.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials and Reagents
High-quality
scheelite and fluorite samples were collected from Yunnan Province,
China. The pure samples were crushed by hand, ground using an agate
mortar, and sieved using Tyler screens. A sample of 38–90 μm
fraction was used in the flotation tests and XPS analysis. The <5
μm fraction was used for zeta-potential measurements. Chemical
analyses and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) indicated that the purities
of the scheelite and fluorite particles exceeded 97%. The results
of the XRD analyses are shown in Figure 1. The water for all experiments was ultrapure
water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm. The reagents used in
this study are shown in Table 1.

2.2 Microflotation
Microflotation experiments
were performed at room temperature in an XFG flotation machine assembled
with a 40 mL plexiglass cell at an impeller speed of 1800 rpm. A mineral
suspension was prepared by adding 2 g of the mineral sample (1.0 g
of scheelite and 1.0 g of fluorite for artificially mixed minerals)
into the plexiglass cell with 30 mL of ultrapure water. A flowsheet
of the microflotation experimental procedure is shown in Figure 2. When SS was used
as the sole depressant, NaOH was first added and conditioned for 1
min to adjust the pulp pH. Then, SS was added and conditioned for
2 min. Finally, oleic acid (1.8 × 10–4 mol/L)
was added and conditioned for 2 min. The total flotation time was
5 min. When both FeSO4·7H2O and SS were
used as depressants in flotation, three different addition methods
were employed, in which the freshly prepared FeSO4 solution
was added before the addition of sodium hydroxide (point 1, Figure 2), together with
the SS (point 2, Figure 2), and after the water glass (point 3, Figure 2). The conditioning times of FeSO4·7H2O was 5 min for all addition types.

Figure 2 Flowsheet of
the microflotation experimental procedure.

For the single mineral flotation, the flotation recovery
was calculated
based on the mass ratios. For the flotation of the mixed minerals,
the WO3 grades of the concentrates and tailings were analyzed,
and their recoveries were calculated.

2.3 Zeta-Potential
Measurement
The zeta
potentials of the minerals were measured using a Brookhaven ZetaPlus
zeta-potential analyzer (USA). The ionic strength of the mineral suspensions
in all measurements was maintained at 3 × 10–3 mol/L using a supporting solution (KNO3). By mixing 50
mg of the mineral sample with 30 mL of ultrapure water containing
different depressants, the mineral suspension was prepared, and the
conditioning times of the reagents followed the flotation tests. Subsequently,
a dilute HCl or NaOH solution was used to adjust the pH of the mixture.
The resultant suspensions were allowed to stand still for 10 min,
and the supernatant of the suspension was transferred to a measuring
vessel using a plastic dropper for zeta-potential measurements at
ambient temperature. The tests were repeated three times and the average
values were calculated.

2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The scheelite and fluorite samples treated with different depressants
were analyzed by XPS. The measurements were performed using a PHI5000
Versa Probe II (PHI5000, ULVAC-PHI, Japan) with an Al Kα X-ray
source. The conditioning times of FeSO4·7H2O and SS were both 5 min. The solid phase was washed three times
by ultrapure water then vacuum dried at 40 °C for 24 h.

A survey scan for the analyzed sample was conducted in the first
place to detect elemental substances, and then a precise scan was
performed to obtain the XPS spectrum of each specific element. MultiPak
Spectrum software was used to analyze the XPS data, including peak
fitting and semiquantitative estimation. The carbon 1s spectral peak
at 284.8 eV was obtained to calibrate all of the measured spectra
as an internal standard for charge compensation.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Depression Behavior of
FeSO4·7H2O
3.1.1 Flotation
Behavior of Scheelite and Fluorite
The flotation behavior
of scheelite and fluorite at different pH
values in the presence or absence of FeSO4·7H2O is shown in Figure 3. In this experiment, FeSO4·7H2O and SS were added simultaneously, and the conditioning times for
SS, FeSO4·7H2O, and oleic acid were 5,
5, and 2 min, respectively. Figure 3 shows that the alkaline solution was beneficial for
the inhibition of fluorite. However, when SS (400 mg/L) was used as
a depressant alone, the depression effect towards fluorite was weak,
and the recovery of fluorite was >47%. After the addition of FeSO4·7H2O, the recovery of fluorite significantly
decreased, reaching an optimum value at a pH of 9, where the recovery
decreased from 48 to 35%. Thus, it is clear that FeSO4·7H2O is beneficial for the inhibition of fluorite, which is consistent
with the findings of Oliveira and Sampaio.22 Another benefit of the addition of FeSO4·7H2O is its negligible effect on the scheelite floatability.
The addition of FeSO4·7H2O had almost no
influence on the scheelite flotation with the pH varying from 6 to
9. However, when the pH exceeded 10, the recovery of scheelite rapidly
decreased. Thus, the flotation separation of scheelite and fluorite
can be achieved at a pH of 9–10.

Figure 3 Effect of pH on the floatability
of scheelite and fluorite with
or without the addition of FeSO4·7H2O.
(FeSO4·7H2O and SS were added at the same
time; SS concentration: 400 mg/L; FeSO4·7H2O concentration: 100 mg/L; oleic acid concentration: 1.8 × 10–4 mol/L).

The flotation results can be affected by the addition order
of
the flotation reagents.24 In this study,
three different methods of FeSO4·7H2O addition
were considered: adding FeSO4·7H2O prior
to the addition of NaOH and SS, simultaneous addition of FeSO4·7H2O and SS, and adding FeSO4·7H2O after the addition of SS. The tests of single mineral flotation
were performed to determine the effects of the addition order on the
flotation results with respect to the depressant dosage. Figure 4 shows that the flotation
recovery of scheelite remained unchanged when different reagents addition
order were used; however, it was markedly affected by the FeSO4·7H2O concentration. Scheelite recovery remained
relatively constant with increasing ferrous sulphate addition up to
150 mg/L, above which it decreased notably. Correspondingly, the consequence
of fluorite flotation was dramatically changed by the addition method
of FeSO4·7H2O, and the best depression
effect for fluorite was obtained when FeSO4·7H2O was added prior to NaOH and SS (point 1 in Figure 2). The depression effect of
FeSO4·7H2O on fluorite manifested at low
FeSO4·7H2O dosages, and the recovery decreased
with increasing the dosage. The flotation recovery of fluorite was
only 33.2% at a FeSO4·7H2O dosage of 150
mg/L. Although a larger FeSO4·7H2O dosage
could increase the depression effect towards fluorite, it also reduced
scheelite recovery.

Figure 4 Effect of the FeSO4·7H2O dosage
on the
floatability of scheelite and fluorite: FeSO4·7H2O added prior to NaOH and SS (a,d), FeSO4·7H2O and SS added simultaneously (b,e), FeSO4·7H2O added after SS (c,f). (pH 9.5; SS concentration: 400 mg/L;
oleic acid concentration: 1.8 × 10–4 mol/L).

3.1.2 Flotation
separation of scheelite and fluorite
mineral mixtures
Flotation separation tests of artificially
mixed minerals (with a scheelite-to-fluorite mass ratio of 1:1) were
performed to further investigate the effect of FeSO4·7H2O on the separation performance with respect to the SS dosage. Figure 5 shows that the flotation
performance was significantly affected by the SS dosage. Numerous
studies have shown that the addition of SS improves the grade of scheelite
concentrate but considerably reduces the recovery.25,26 In the absence of FeSO4·7H2O, the optimum
SS dosage for separation was 500 mg/L, at which the recovery and grade
of the produced scheelite were only 87.4 and 62.5%, respectively.
In the presence of FeSO4·7H2O, the separation
of scheelite and fluorite was achieved with a SS dosage of only 400
mg/L, and the recovery and grade of scheelite increased to 91.2 and
64.3%, respectively. Clearly, this improved separation was due to
the addition of FeSO4·7H2O, which reduced
the consumption of SS and increased fluorite inhibition.

samples with respect to the SS dosage in the presence or absence of
FeSO4·7H2O. (pH 9.5; FeSO4·7H2O added prior to NaOH and SS; FeSO4·7H2O concentration: 130 mg/L; oleic acid concentration: 1.8 ×
10–4 mol/L).

3.1.3 Determining Active Ingredients in FeSO4·7H2O
In previous studies, the inhibition
of FeSO4·7H2O was attributed to cations
in the scheelite flotation mixture, but the role of anions was largely
ignored. To investigate the role of SO42– in the flotation separation of scheelite and fluorite, microflotation
tests were performed using various reagents. Fe2+ from
FeCl2, SO42– from Na2SO4, and NaCl as a control were used in this study. The
results presented in Figure 6 show that FeCl2 exhibited the strongest inhibition
effect on fluorite, followed by Na2SO4, and
NaCl showed no depression effect. This indicated that the depression
effect of FeSO4·7H2O is mainly due to the
iron ions. However, SO42– could reduce
the floatability of fluorite too, although this inhibition was not
significant at Na2SO4 dosages below 100 mg/L.
This finding is important for flotation of scheelite.

ions on the fluorite floatability. The ions
were added prior to NaOH and SS (pH 9.5; oleic acid concentration:
1.8 × 10–4 mol/L).

3.2 Depression Mechanism of FeSO4·7H2O
3.2.1 Zeta-Potential Measurements
Zeta-potential
measurement is an in situ method that can be used to explore the interactions
of ionic species with minerals. To investigate the mechanism of the
FeSO4·7H2O depressant on the mineral surfaces,
zeta-potential measurements were determined as a function of pH, as
shown in Figure 7.
From Figure 7, the
zeta potential of scheelite was negative and decreased along with
the increase of the pH either with or without a depressant. The isoelectric
point of fluorite occurred at pH 8.1, which is in accordance with
the previous literature.7,23,27 After separate treatments with FeCl2 and Na2SO4, the zeta potentials of fluorite showed a pronounced
shift towards more positive values and a slight shift towards more
negative values, respectively, indicating that both Fe2+ and SO42– were adsorbed on the fluorite
surface.

Figure 7 Zeta potentials of scheelite (a) and fluorite (b) with respect
to the pH (FeSO4·7H2O concentration: 130
mg/L; SS concentration: 400 mg/L).

The SS is soluble in water, and numerous silicate species
can form
in the solution. Si(OH)4, SiO(OH)3–, and SiO2(OH)2– are the
dominant monomeric species with protons transferred between different
species as the pH changed.28,29 The balanced equations
and equilibrium constants of the silicate species are presented in eqs 1–3 and their distribution diagrams are shown in Figure 8.30−32 At pH values
of <9.4, 9.4–12.6, and >12.6, the main components in
the
solution were Si(OH)4, SiO(OH)3–, and SiO2(OH)2–, respectively. 1   2   3  

Figure 8 Species distribution
diagrams for SS with respect to the pH.

Figure 7 shows
that
the zeta potential of both scheelite and fluorite shifted to a more
negative value after the addition of 400 mg/L SS, and the fluorite
potential shift was more significant than that of scheelite. This
indicates that the number of silicate species adsorbed on the fluorite
surface is much more than that of scheelite. Figure 8 shows that the main species involved in
the flotation separation of scheelite from fluorite were Si(OH)4 and SiO(OH)3– at a pH of 9–10,
where both the zeta potentials of fluorite and scheelite showed negative
values. This indicates that the adsorption mechanisms of Si(OH)4 and SiO(OH)3– on the surface
of scheelite and fluorite maybe dominated by chemisorption (in eqs 4 and 5, ≡ is the mineral surface).23 4   5  

After the reaction with silicate species, the number of active
sites (≡CaOH) on the fluorite surface was significantly reduced,
while those on the scheelite surface demonstrated a reduced effect.
This difference led to the flotation separation of the two minerals
.23 After the addition of FeSO4·7H2O, the zeta potential of scheelite was unaffected
compared with the case of the addition of SS alone (Figure 7a). However, a significant
decrease in the zeta potential of fluorite was observed after the
simultaneous accretion of FeSO4·7H2O and
SS (Figure 7b). This
suggests that FeSO4·7H2O facilitated the
adsorption of negative species on the fluorite surface but not the
scheelite surface. This phenomenon is beneficial for the separation
of scheelite from fluorite. During the addition of FeSO4·7H2O, another negative species (SO42–) was introduced to the solution. To investigate the
relationship between the decreased zeta potential and SO42–, FeCl2, and Na2SO4 were used as depressants for the zeta-potential tests in
the presence of SS (Figure 7b). The zeta potential of fluorite + Na2SO4 + SS was nearly identical to that of fluorite + SS, indicating
that Fe2+ and not SO42– in
FeSO4·7H2O promotes the adsorption of SS
on the surface of fluorite.

3.2.2 XPS
analysis of scheelite with depressants
The XPS was used to
detect the properties of mineral surface species,
including the elemental composition and chemical states of a mineral
surface, according to the distinctive binding energies of the inner
electrons of each element.33,34 The changes of atomic
concentrations and chemical states on the mineral surface of the two
samples are shown in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the atomic concentration of Si was only 0.65% which made
clear that a small amount of SS was adsorbed on the surface of scheelite
when SS, put alone, was used at a 400 mg/L dosage. This is consistent
with the zeta potential results. With the FeSO4·7H2O + SS treatment, Fe was detected on the scheelite surface
at a low atomic concentration of 0.16%, and the atomic concentration
of Si rose by 0.27%, indicating that the Fe2+ slightly
promoted the adsorption of SS on the scheelite surface. However, the
microflotation results indicate that such a small increase did not
significantly change the scheelite floatability.

3.2.3 XPS
analysis of fluorite with depressants
There are two possible
pathways for the Fe2+ and SS
adsorption process: the two reagents successively adsorbed on the
mineral surface, the other one is the two reagents react to form a
new complex, and then adsorbed on the mineral surface.14,15Figure 9 shows the
high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p peaks on the fluorite surface.
It demonstrated that, in the absence of FeSO4·7H2O, there was no signal of Fe 2p on the fluorite surface. However,
after treated with FeSO4·7H2O, significant
Fe 2p (with the atom concentration of 1.93%) characteristic peaks
appeared on the surface. It indicated that the Fe2+ could
adsorb on the fluorite surface. In the presence of both FeSO4·7H2O and SS, the Fe atom concentration increased
by only a small amount (0.12%). Thus, the adsorption mechanism of
Fe2+ and SS is mainly that Fe2+ was first adsorbed
on the fluorite surface, and then the silicate species were adsorbed
at the Fe2+ site. Table 3 lists the changes of atomic concentrations on the
fluorite surface with SS or FeSO4·7H2O
+ SS treatments. Because of the addition of FeSO4·7H2O, the concentrations of calcium and silicon changed by −4.64%
and +2.42%, respectively. Combined with the zeta-potential results,
it can be concluded that the adsorbed Fe2+ provided an
abundance of reaction sites and promoted the subsequent adsorption
of silicate species on the fluorite surface. The more silicate species
is adsorbed on the fluorite surface, the more hydrophilic it is.23 Thus, the FeSO4·7H2O + SS exhibited a more significant depression effect on fluorite
than SS functioning solely, which is consistent with the results of
the flotation tests.

The binding energy peaks of calcium,
fluorine, oxygen, and silicon
were measured on the fluorite surface. Figure 10 shows the Ca 2p, F 1s, O 1s, and Si 2p
XPS spectra for fluorite treated with FeSO4·7H2O + SS or SS alone. Figure 10(1) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of the Ca
2p peaks for fluorite reacted with different depressants. Two peaks
appear at 347.42 and 351.02 eV, which were assigned to Ca 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively,35,36 indicating
that fluorite consisted of pure calcium fluoride (CaF2).
After treatment with SS alone, the binding energy of Ca 2p3/2 increased to 347.80 eV, indicating that the environment of the calcium
ions changed. This is attributed to the fluoride ions, which were
coordinated with the calcium ions and replaced by silicate ions, forming
calcium silicate on the fluorite surface.37 This phenomenon was also reported by Ai and Zhang.35,36 With FeSO4·7H2O + SS treatment, the binding
energy of Ca 2p3/2 increased by 0.25 eV. Although this
change is small, it suggests that more silicate species combined with
calcium ions on the fluorite surface under this treatment regime.

treated with FeSO4·7H2O and SS at a pH
of 9.5 (FeSO4·7H2O concentration: 130 mg/L;
SS concentration: 400 mg/L).

The F 1s spectrum of the original fluorite in Figure 10(2) exhibits only one well-fitted
peak at 684.93 eV. After treatment with SS or FeSO4·7H2O + SS, the binding energy of fluorine 1s shifted by <0.2
eV, which is similar to the instrumental error, illustrating that
the electron density of fluorine witnessed no change significantly.
All the results presented herein indicated that the fluoride ions
in the fluorite did not react with the depressants.38

For O 1s spectra, in Figure 10(3), only one spectral peak at 531.96 eV
was fitted
reasonably well for the fluorite sample treated with SS alone. This
peak was assigned to the O 1s from the SS.35,38 After treatment with FeSO4·7H2O + SS,
the binding energy of O 1s in the SS increased a rise of 0.24 eV,
likely owing to the reaction between the silicate species and Fe2+.23 Moreover, a new peak emerged
at 530.12 eV, which was attributed to the O 1s in the sulfate group
of CaSO4.39Figure 6 indicates that the addition
of Na2SO4 helps to depress fluorite. Thus, it
can be inferred that the formation of CaSO4 on the fluorite
surface is the reason for the depression (in eq 6), and the same conclusion was obtained by
Zhang et al.40 6  

For Si 2p, distinct peaks
were witnessed in each spectrum (Figure 10(4)). When SS alone
was used as the depressant, the peak at 102.14 eV was attributed to
Si 2p in CaSiO3.41 After the
addition of FeSO4·7H2O, a new peak appeared
at 101.37 eV, which was ascribed to the reaction product of the ferrous
ions and silicate species.23

3.3 Discussion
Both scheelite and fluorite
are highly soluble salt minerals but exhibit differences in their
dissolution mechanisms. For scheelite, the Ca2+ preferentially
transferred into the solution over WO42–, resulting in the scheelite surface lacking Ca2+ with
excess WO42–, imparting an overall negative
charge. The dissociation of fluorite in the aqueous solution occurs
in the opposite manner to that of scheelite. Fluorine anions preferentially
transferred into the solution over Ca2+, resulting in excess
Ca2+ on the surface and an overall positive charge.42−44 According to the XPS analysis results, ≡CaOH represents the
most important active sites, which react with silicate species on
the fluorite and scheelite surfaces. However, Tables 2 and 3 display that
the atomic concentrations of calcium on scheelite and fluorite surfaces
were 10.82 and 28.92%, respectively. Remarkably, this difference may
be the theoretical basis for the flotation separation of scheelite
from fluorite.

Tables 2 and 3 show the adsorption of Fe2+ and SO42– on the fluorite and
scheelite surfaces in the presence of FeSO4·7H2O + SS. The results indicate that only a small amount of Fe2+ adsorbed on the scheelite surface. By contrast, a considerable
amount of Fe2+ was detected on the fluorite surface. Hydroxyl
groups are abundant on the fluorite surface and can interact with
Fe species initiated by dehydration reactions in the coating process
of ferrous hydroxyl compounds on fluorite surfaces.45 This selective adsorption further increases the difference
in the number of active sites between scheelite and fluorite. In addition,
XPS only detected sulfur on the surface of fluorite, without any characteristic
trace on the scheelite surface. Sulfate, which has a strong hydration
effect, likely reacted with the ≡CaOH active site or ions exchanged
with fluoride ions on the fluorite surface, resulting in the increased
hydrophilicity of the fluorite surface.39 These results indicate that FeSO4 preferentially adsorbed
on the surface of fluorite over scheelite, forming the hydrophilic
CaSO4 and increasing the quantity of active sites on the
fluorite surface. According to the aforementioned experimental results,
the following mechanism is proposed for the adsorption of FeSO4 onto the fluorite surface (Figure 11).

Figure 11 Mechanism for the adsorption of FeSO4 onto the fluorite
surface.

From Figure 4, the
addition orders of FeSO4·7H2O and SS are
crucial for flotation separation. The pre-addition of FeSO4·7H2O is conducive to the formation of active sites
containing iron species. It is likely that the ferrous species were
first adsorbed onto the fluorite surface and subsequently reacted
with silicate to form hydrophilic metal-silicate chelate complexes,
which were responsible for improving the depression of fluorite. A
possible mechanism for the silicate species onto the Fe-modified fluorite
surface is schematically suggested in Figure 12.

onto the fluorite
surface.

4 Conclusions
This study examined the effect of FeSO4·7H2O on the flotation separation of scheelite from fluorite with
SS as a depressant. The interaction of Fe2+, SO42–, and silicate species with scheelite and fluorite
surfaces was studied using microflotation tests, zeta-potential tests,
and XPS analysis to understand the underlying mechanism. According
to the aforementioned results, the following conclusions can be drawn.The auxiliary depressant FeSO4·7H2O, which was added prior to the addition
of NaOH and SS, exhibited
improved selective depression for fluorite compared with the case
of SS alone. With the addition of FeSO4·7H2O, the separation of scheelite and fluorite was completed at a SS
dosage of 400 mg/L, and the recovery and grade of scheelite were increased
by 4.3 and 2.7%, respectively.

The XPS
results indicate that the difference in the
number of surface active sites is the basis for the flotation separation
of scheelite from fluorite. The Fe2+ is preferentially
adsorbed on the surface of fluorite and increases the number of active
sites which can react with silicate species.

Sulfate ions are selectively adsorbed on the surface
of fluorite with the formation of hydrophilic calcium sulfate, which
reduces the floatability of fluorite.
