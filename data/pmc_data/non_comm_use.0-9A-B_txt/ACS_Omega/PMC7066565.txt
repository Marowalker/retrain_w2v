In this work, direct gas-phase epoxidation
of propylene (DPO) to
propylene oxide by molecular oxygen has been studied by using Ag–MoO3 supported on titanium-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica
(Ti-HMSn) of different Si/Ti molar ratios.
The promotion effect of NaCl on the synthesized catalysts has also
been investigated. Among the studied supports, the hexagonal mesoporous
silica (HMS) with a Si/Ti ratio of 10 was the most suitable one for
production of propylene oxide (PO). The optimal performance of the
AgMo/Ti-HMS10 catalyst in DPO exhibited a selectivity to
PO of 43.2% with a propylene conversion of 14.1%, at 400 °C,
0.1 MPa, and a space velocity of 12,000 h–1. The
catalyst verified good stability over at least 20 h on stream. Only
2.7% PO selectivity with a propylene conversion of 10.1% was achieved
over the AgMo/HMS sample. The incorporation of Ti into the HMS frame
could optimize the particle size distribution of Ag, producing Ag
nanoparticles with an average size of 6.8 nm compared with that of
Ag/HMS (24.3 nm). The in situ Raman spectrum of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 heated in a stream of C3H6/He at 400 °C
showed new bands at 616, 390, and 210 cm–1, characteristic
of the AgxMoyOz intermediate phase. The obtained results
suggested that this formed AgMo/Ti-HMS10 phase could most
likely be relevant for selective epoxidation of propylene. However,
during the reaction of C3H6 with AgMo/HMS, the
formation of this intermediate was hardly detected. On the other hand,
the hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction measurements indicated
improved reducibility of MoO3 in the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 catalyst, which acknowledged the role of Mo6+ in gaining
electrons from silver to form positively charged Ag. This could reduce
the effective charge of the adsorbed oxygen on silver sites and in
turn favor the epoxidation path of propylene rather than the combustion
route. Also, during the reaction of C3H6 with
NaAgMo/Ti-HMS10 at 400 °C, two new Raman bands were
detected at 277 and 350 cm–1, characteristic of
Ag2MoO4.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Direct
gas-phase catalytic epoxidation of propylene (DPO) has received
much attention in the last few years as the currently used multiple
step processes (viz., chlorohydrin and hydroperoxidation) are extremely
energy-consuming and cause some environmental problems.1 Ag-based catalysts have been extensively studied
in DPO in the last years by several researchers.2−9 The chemical structure of the industrial catalyst is usually complex
involving many elements. For commercialization of DPO process over
Ag-based catalysts, additional work seemed to be required. This should
assist in the identification of the suitable promoters and moreover
in understanding their roles in selective propylene oxide (PO) production.
Ag catalysts promoted by MoO3 and deposited on different
materials, such as CaCO3, CaF2, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, TiO2–SiO2, and TiO2–ZrO2, were developed
by Jin et al.10−12 as promising catalysts for DPO to PO in the presence
of only molecular oxygen. Ag–MoO3 supported on ZrO2 was the more selective one for PO formation at 400 °C,
0.1 MPa, and a space velocity of 7500 h–1. A selectivity
to PO of 60.3% was achieved with only propylene conversion approaching
1.0%. Although Ag–MoO3 supported on TiO2–SiO2 was the more stable and active one, at 300
°C, 0.1 MPa, and a space velocity of 7500 h–1, it achieved a selectivity to PO of 2.0% and to CO2 of
92.7%, with propylene conversion less than 1.0%. The improvement of
the supported Ag–MoO3 catalyst is thus still demanded
to enhance its catalytic performance in DPO. Concerning the role of
silver particle sizes on propylene epoxidation, the larger particle
sizes of Ag in the mentioned catalytic system were considered to be
beneficial to improve the epoxidation performance.10 However, significant differences between the suggestion
of Jin et al.10 and other views in several
related studies were recognized, for example:There is a significant difference between the size of
the selective silver particles for DPO using Ag supported on an alumina
film as reported by Lei group13 (∼3.5
nm) and that identified by Jin and his co-workers (viz., 300–500
nm) for Ag–MoO3/ZrO2.10

The study of Lu et al. on
Ag/CaCO3 catalyst
showed that DPO at 200–220 °C was structure-insensitive
with respect to Ag particle size ranging from 50 to 660 nm.14 Later on, in another work by the same group,
the Ag particles of sizes between 400 and 700 nm supported on either
CaCO3 or α-Al2O3 were found
to exhibit the highest propylene selectivity to PO at 260 °C.15

Zemichael and his
co-workers also found that K-promoted
Ag/CaCO3 catalysts containing silver crystallites of size
in 20–40 nm range produced the maximum PO yield.16

According to Wang
et al., Ag particles of 40.1 nm size
led to combustion of propylene over 19.9 wt % Ag/TS-1.8 However, Guo et al. indicated that 2 wt % Ag/TS-1 catalyst
of 8.0 nm Ag particles size achieves a considerable selectivity to
PO (∼94%) in C3H6 epoxidation in the
presence of H2 and O2, but with a very low conversion
(1.9%).17

Recently, Ghosh et al.18 reported
that silver nanoparticles (<5 nm) supported on WO3 nanorods
successfully catalyzed the DPO.



On the
other hand, several studies have found that the selectivity
of Au particles in DPO was also extremely sensitive to their size
and shape. The reaction of propene with O2 and H2 using Au particles with smaller size, for example, 1.5–2.0
nm, produced mainly propane. The particles larger than 4–5
nm could assist oxidation of propene to CO2 and H2O.19−21 Adopting titanium-containing hexagonal mesoporous
silica (Ti-HMS) as a support for Au particles improved their catalytic
performance in DPO by O2/H2 mixture. The superior
catalytic performance in production of PO in this case was attributed
to the homogeneous dispersion and uniformity of titanium species controlling
the size of Au particles (∼4 nm).22

The present study was undertaken to shed more light on the
impact
of modification of hexagonal mesoporous silica by titanium on the
size of Ag particles and consequently on the silver catalytic performance
in the DPO reaction in the presence of promoters (viz., MoO3 and NaCl). For this aim, a series of catalysts with Ag particles
of different sizes have been synthesized, having the same composition
of Ag, Mo, and NaCl (as promoters) and hexagonal mesoporous silica
(HMS) as a support. Controlling of the Ag particles sizes was performed
through incorporation of different amounts of Ti into HMS support.22 A trial was also done to control the reducibility
of silver and MoO3 by modifying the AgMo/Ti-HMS catalysts
with NaCl. The catalytic functionality of the as-synthesized catalyst
systems was studied in DPO using solely molecular oxygen at atmospheric
pressure in a tubular down flow reactor.23 Detailed investigation of the various physicochemical characteristics
of the catalyst samples was displayed through several techniques,
for example, N2 physisorption, hydrogen temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping,
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV–vis spectroscopy,
and potentiometric acid–base titration.24 In addition, in situ laser Raman spectroscopy was used
as a powerful technique for investigating the catalytic materials
under the reaction conditions.25 The study
was extended to characterize the AgMo/Ti-HMS catalysts during the
reduction by propylene at 400 °C at different time intervals,
followed by reoxidation with oxygen. The objective of involving the
Raman spectroscopic features by changing the Ag particle sizes was
to confirm the structure–performance relationships and to explore
the synergism profile of the catalyst components, namely, Na, Ag,
Mo, and Ti.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Textural
Characteristics
The surface
parameters of the catalysts under study, derived from the obtained
N2-adsorption–desorption isotherms, are summarized
in Table 1. All the
titanium-containing HMS samples, including AgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts, exhibited type IV isotherms in the IUPAC
classification, almost characteristic for highly ordered mesoporous
materials, with H1-type hysteresis loop indicating a narrow distribution
of relatively uniform cylindrical pores26 (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information corresponds to typical large-pore mesoporous materials with cylindrical
channels). It is clear from Table 1 that, upon loading Ag and Mo onto the different titanium
containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Ti-HMSn) supports, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area and the pore volume decrease, while the pore diameter
is slightly increased, as compared to the pure Ti-HMSn supports. This may refer to some incorporation of
Ag and/or Mo in the HMS pore system.

2.2 XRD Analysis
The XRD patterns of
AgMo/Ti-HMSn, Ag/Ti-HMSn, and NaAgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts
are depicted in Figures 1, S2, and S3 (Supporting Information),
respectively. For Ag/Ti-HMSn, the diffraction
peaks of d spacings 2.34, 2.03, 1.44, and 1.23 Å
related to the crystal faces of Ag (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and
(3 1 1) (JCPDS file, 87-0720) were detected (Figure S2). For comparison, the diffraction peaks of d-spacings 2.68, 2.32, 1.64, and 1.402 Å, characteristic of Ag2O phase (JCPDS file, 03-0796), and those of d-spacings 2.79, 2.68, and 1.418 Å, characteristic of AgO phase
(JCPDS file, 43-1038), are represented in Figure S2. It is obviously shown from Figure 1 that the same Ag, Ag2O, and AgO
phases can be distinguished in the diffraction patterns of all AgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts. Beside these phases, the MoO3 phase (JCPDS file, 05-0508) of d-spacings
5.35, 3.27, 2.13, 1.89, 1.78, 1.64, 1.47, 1.24, and 1.21 Å can
be noticed in the diffraction patterns of AgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts (Figure 1). Furthermore, the XRD patterns of NaAgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts did not show detectable change
in the strength order of different peaks of Ag, Ag2O, AgO,
and MoO3 phases after doping of AgMo/Ti-HMSn with NaCl. On the other hand, small-angle XRD pattern
(Figure S4) of the synthesized Ti-HMS10 shows a single diffaction peak at 2θ = 1.8° due
to the (100) reflection, which confirm the presence of HMS of mesoporous
structure with short-range hexagonal symmetry.22

(Ti-HMS)-supported silver molybdenum oxides catalysts. Peaks marked
by the symbol “○”, “*”, “◊”,
and “△” assigned to MoO3, AgO, Ag2O, and Ag, respectively.

2.3 Surface Acidity
The variation of
both ΔΓO– (amount of acid)
and ΔΓH+ (amount of base) with pH
for the different Ti-HMSn supports and
their corresponding Ag–MoO3-supported catalysts
as well as the catalysts modified by NaCl is shown in Figures 2 and S5–S7. It is evident that the loading of silver, molybdenum, or sodium
chloride over the different Ti-HMSn supports
resulted in a shift in the point of zero charge (p.z.c.) to a higher
pH values (Table 1).
The obtained results suggest that the surfaces of supported Ag–MoO3 catalysts exhibit weaker acidity than those of the parent
Ti-HMSn supports. This may be linked with
the interaction of both Ag and MoO3 species, most likely
with the acidic hydroxyl groups of these supports.

of base) on pH for Ti-HMS10 support, Ag and Mo supported
on samples, and AgMo/Ti-HMS10 sample doped by sodium chloride.

2.4 FT-IR Analysis
The incorporation
profile of titanium in the silica framework could be confirmed through
the FT-IR analysis (Figures S8 and S9).
It seems of special interest that both the Ti-HMSn and Ag/Ti-HMSn samples exhibit
a band at around 960 cm–1 in their spectra. This
band has been widely used to characterize the incorporation of metal
ions in the silica framework. The stretching Si–O vibration
mode is known to be perturbed by the presence of neighboring metal
ions.9

2.5 UV–Vis
Spectroscopic Analysis
As shown from the UV–vis spectra
of the various Ti-HMSn catalysts (Figure S10a), all the samples exhibit the characteristic
intraframework tetrahedral-coordinated
titanium band at ca. 220 nm.9,25,27,28 However, a very broad band 240–320
nm detected in the spectra (Figure S10b), may characterize the six- or eightfold coordination Ti(IV) species
that are most probably generated through the hydration of tetrahedral
coordinated species.27−29 In addition, the spectrum of Ti-HMS5 shows
a shoulder at ca. 330 nm, attributable to bulk titanium oxide.30

The band at ca. 230 nm, characteristic
of the intraframework tetrahedral coordinated titanium species, is
retained in the spectra of all samples in Figure 3.27−29 On the other hand, the spectra
of Ag/HMS and Ag/Ti-HMS40 (Figure 3a,b) show a broad peak centered at 470 nm,
which may be linked with the formation of either Ag or Ag2O aggregates.27,31 However, in the case of Ag/Ti-HMS10 (Figure 3c), the absence of this band may point to the effect of increasing
Ti content in enhancing even dispersion of Ag species on the Ti-HMS10 surface, effecting the strong Ag–Ti interaction.
Moreover, as shown in Figure 3d,e, the observed broad band extending in the 400–600
nm range for both AgMo/Ti-HMS10 and NaAgMo/Ti-HMS10 samples may be referred to the aggregation of silver particles.
It can thus be suggested that molybdenum and sodium chloride have
negative effects on Ag dispersion, reflecting most probably the strong
interaction between these species (Mo and Na) with silver.

2.6 TEM–EDX
Analysis
The TEM images
of Ag/HMS and Ag/Ti-HMSn samples of different
Ti contents are depicted in Figure 4. The aggregation of Ag particles with an average size
of 24.3 nm on the parent silica (HMS) support of zero titanium content
is clearly demonstrated in Figure 4a, while the particle size distribution histogram is
represented in Figure 4e. The addition of titanium to HMS obviously results in a slight
decrease of Ag average particle size to 23.0 nm as shown in Figures 4b and S11a, especially for the Ag/Ti-HMS40 sample. By increasing the Ti content, from a Si/Ti molar ratio of
40–10, a further decrease in Ag particle size is noticed. The
TEM images (c and d in Figure 4) show almost spherically shaped Ag nanoparticles with average
sizes of 6.8 and 7.8 nm in Ag/Ti-HMS10 and AgMo/Ti-HMS10, respectively, as calculated from particle size distribution
histograms (Figure S11b) and Figure 4f. The measured average particle
size of Ag in the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 sample seems to be an approximate
value because of the presence of Mo particles in the sample and further
characterization of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 system is necessitated.
However, this value was taken into account in our discussion as the
weight percentage of Ag in the catalyst was ∼5 times higher
than that of Mo, which led us to neglect the Mo particles size effect.
It can also be observed that the Ti-HMS10 surface in Figure 4 (images c and d)
is largely covered by Ag clusters. Moreover, the wormhole mesoporous
structure of the HMS support in Ag/Ti-HMS10 is indicated
in the high-magnification image (Figure S12).22

and (d) AgMo/Ti-HMSi10 and plots of Ag particle distribution
in (e) Ag/HMS and in (f) AgMo/Ti-HMSi10.

The EDX spectra and mapping image collected for AgMo/Ti-HMS10 (Figure S13 and Figure 5) confirm the existence of
homogeneously distributed silver and Mo on the top surface of the
Ti-HMS10 support, occupying the same location with Ti on
the HMS surface. These species seem to be in good contact as illustrated
in the EDX mapping morphological image (Figure 5), which shows Ag, Mo, and Ti as having a
large contact area on the HMS support with enhanced dual–parallel
interactions (mostly between Ag and Ti and between Ag and Mo species).

2.7 Hydrogen Temperature-Programmed
Reduction
As shown in the TPR curve of Ag/Ti-HMS10 catalysts (Figure 6a), the reduction
peak at Tr = 210 °C is characteristic
of well-dispersed silver oxide clusters or ions,32 while that one at Tr = 843
°C can be attributed to reduction of Ti-HMS support. For the
Mo/Ti-HMS10 catalyst, four reduction peaks are observed
(Figure 6b) in the
temperature range from 200 to 900 °C, indicating the stepwise
reduction of Mo6+ to Mo0.33−35 The two peaks
at 395 and 470 °C can be assigned to the reduction of well dispersed
poly-molybdate to MoO2 and reduction of crystalline MoO3 to MoO2, respectively.33,34 The reduction of MoO2 to Mo0 is represented
in the third and fourth peaks at 701 and 870 °C. It seems that
the fourth reduction peak of Mo4+(MoO2) to Mo0 at 870 °C is overlapped with that one characteristic
of the reduction of Ti-HMS support.

Figure 6 Temperature-programmed reduction profiles
of the Ag and/or Mo supported
on Ti-HMS10 samples and that doped by sodium chloride.

In the TPR profile of AgMo/Ti-HMSi10 catalyst (Figure 6c), the first peak
at 268 °C seems to most likely be attributable to the reduction
of Ag2O, which in turn is shifted to a higher temperature
by 58°, as probably effected by Ag–Mo interaction. Furthermore,
it becomes wider as compared with that of Ag/Ti-HMS10 (Figure 6a). The main two
peaks corresponding to the reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 are also shifted to higher temperatures, viz., 409 and 511
°C, being evidently weaker than those peaks observed at 395 and
470 °C for the neat Mo/Ti-HMSi10. This may confirm
the strong interaction between silver species and MoO3,
which can clearly be supported by the acidity results illustrated
in Figure 2. On the
other hand, the peak corresponding to reduction of MoO2 to Mo0 (viz., 870 °C) becomes stronger and wider
at temperatures ranged between 666 and 892 °C. This may also
point to the effect of Ag in enhancing the reduction of MoVI to MoIV. Moreover, the addition of NaCl to AgMo/Ti-HMSi10 appears to induce an increase in the strength of the peak
characteristic for reduction of silver oxide, at 248°, and that
one of MoVI to MoIV reduction, at 480 °C
(cf., Figure 6d). These
findings reveal the positive effect of NaCl on the exposure of more
surface Ag oxide species, being accompanied with some complication
in the reduction profile of MoO3.

2.8 In Situ
Raman Spectroscopic Analysis
The in situ laser Raman spectrum
of the Ti-HMSin support, collected at
ambient temperature, is shown in Figure S14. It consists of a broad strong band
at 1070 cm–1 and two weak bands at 939 and 512 cm–1, most probably in a parallel manner with that one
reported previously for titanium-containing hexagonal mesoporous silicas.22 However, a new weak band at 147 cm–1, which corresponds to extra-frame work titanium species, can be
observed in the Raman spectrum of Ti-HMS10 sample (Figure S14c).36 The
increase of titanium leads to an increase in the intensity and the
breadth of this band (at 147 cm–1) in the spectrum
of Ti-HMS5 (Figure S14d).

On the other hand, two new bands at 717 and 484 cm–1, characteristic of Ag2O species,37−39 are detected in the Raman spectrum of Ag/Ti-HMSi10 (Figure 7b), besides those
bands observed for Ti-HMSi10 support. Also, the spectrum
of AgMo/Ti-HMSi10 (Figure 7c) reveals the presence of a new band at 815 cm–1, which can be assigned to MoO3 species.40

Figure 7 Raman spectra of (a) Ti-HMS10 support, (b)
Ag/Ti-HMS10, and (c) AgMo/Ti-HMS10 collected
at 25 °C.

By heating the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 sample in a flow of C3H6/He at 400
°C, no significant changes could
be detected in the Raman features of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 through
1.0 h duration. This observation can be attributed to the low concentration
of Mo (∼4 wt %) in the catalyst. It is worth mentioning that
Raman cannot detect any expected changes in the band features (viz.,
intensity, broadening, shift, appearance, and disappearance) in the
spectrum of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 sample, unless these changes
are accumulated with time. Therefore, after 1.0 h of exposure of this
sample to propylene atmosphere at 400 °C, the spectrum obtained
(Figure 8) declared
the appearance of two weak broad bands at 616 and 390 cm–1. Continuous exposure of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 pellets to a flow
of 10% C3H6 in He for 2.0 h, at the same temperature
(400 °C), resulted in the appearance of a new additional band
at 210 cm–1 and disappearance of the two weak bands
at 717 and 484 cm–1, characteristic of Ag2O, and that one of MoO3 at 815 cm–1 (Figure 8). These new bands
appeared at 616, 390, and 210 cm–1 are most likely
assigned to AgxMoyOz (Ag/α-MoO3).41 Moreover, a steady decrease in the intensities
of all bands of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 sample was observed by increasing
the exposure time from 2.0 to 24 h in propylene atmosphere at 400
°C. Cooling the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 pellet back to ambient
temperature in He atmosphere (Figure 9c) restored the intensities of the band characteristic
of Ag2O, MoO3, and Ti-HMS, which were originally
present before treatment. This observation may suggest that the change
in the band intensities is linked with the long-time temperature effect.
However, the sharper Raman features of bands at 616, 390, and 210
cm–1, characteristic of AgxMoyOz phase existing in the spectra of AgMo/Ti-HMSi10 upon
exposure to C3H6 at 400 °C for 2.0 h (Figure 8), did not restore
after cooling (Figure 9c), which indicates that these observed Raman changes are not due
to temperature treatment. Upon heating the C3H6-treated AgMo/Ti-HMSi10 sample for 24 h at 400 °C
sample in a stream of 10% O2/He at 400 °C for 2.0
h (Figure 9d), the
intensities of all bands have been improved, but the reappearance
of those bands characteristic of AgxMoyOz did not occur.
These results may confirm the multiple interactions between Ag and
Mo in AgMo/Ti-HMS10 sample, as suggested by H2-TPR and surface acidity results of the present study.

after reoxidation with 10%O2/He for 2.0 h at 400 °C.

In contrast, the Raman spectra associated with
heating of AgMo/HMS
showed different features, where heating of this sample in a stream
of C3H6 at 400 °C for 18 h (Figure 10c,d) did not distinctly show
the bands characteristic of the AgxMoyOz phase that
was observed in the case of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 sample. The only
change observed is the steady decrease in the intensities of all bands
with increasing heating time. Cooling of the sample back to room temperature
(Figure 10e) restored
the sharper Raman features present in the spectra of AgMo/HMS prior
to heating in C3H6, which may indicate that
these detected changes are almost refereed to the temperature treatment.

spectra of (a) neat HMS and (b) AgMo/HMS catalyst collected
at 25 °C and that of AgMo/HMS (c,d) collected in flow of 22.7%
C3H6/He at 400 °C at different time intervals
2.0 and 18 h, respectively and (e) collected at 25 °C in flow
of He after reduction in flow of propylene at 400 °C for 18 h.

On the other hand, the Raman spectra of NaAgMo/Ti-HMSi10 collected during the heating in a flow of C3H6/He at different time intervals at 400 °C are represented
in Figure 11. As shown,
for
instance, in Figure 11b, after 1 h exposure of the sample to propylene atmosphere at 400
°C, the position of the band at 815 cm–1 characteristics
of MoO3 has shifted to higher wave number by about 9 cm–1. However, this band disappeared after 24 h of continuous
exposure to a stream of C3H6 in He (Figure 11d). Also, it is
clear from Figure 11e that the reappearance of this band has occurred after cooling the
sample back to ambient temperature. Yet, the cooling or reoxidation
of the sample in oxygen atmosphere (Figure 11f) did not restore the band position observed
prior to the thermal treatment (Figure 11a). The obtained results may indicate that
the noticed small shift in band position arises because of the interaction
between MoO3 and NaCl.42 On
the other hand, the Raman spectrum associated with heating of NaAgMo/Ti-HMSi10 with C3H6 for 2.0 h at 400 °C
(Figure 11) shows
the appearance of two weak bands at 277 and 350 cm–1, referred probably to the presence of a well-defined Ag2MoO4 intermediate phase.41

2.9 Catalyst Performance
2.9.1 Catalytic
Performance of Various Synthesized
Samples in DPO
The catalytic activity of Ag, AgMo, and NaAgMo
loaded on HMS and Ti-HSMn supports in
DPO at 400 °C are summarized in Table 2. Figure 12 represents the variation of propylene conversion in
terms of DPO products (acetone, acetaldehyde, PO, and COx) with Si/Ti ratio. It is evident that the pure HMS
support is inactive in the conversion of DPO to PO under the studied
reaction conditions and (only COx were
produced) (Table 2).
For Ti-HMSn supports, very low selectivity
to PO (<1.0%) could be noticed at the different Si/Ti ratios (Figure 12a). Similarly,
Sugiyama et al.43 indicated that incorporation
of Ti into MCM-41 resulted in no activity for the epoxidation of propylene.
Moreover, acetone was detected as the main oxygenate organic product,
where the selectivity to acetone remained nearly constant with Si/Ti
ratio ranging between 10 and 40 (Figure 12a). Also, no remarkable change could be
observed in selectivity to acetone by doping Ti-HMSn supports with Ag or Mo and by the presence of NaCl. The selectivity
remained almost constant in the range 4–6% at different Si/Ti
ratios (Figure 12b–d).
It can thus be suggested that Ti-HSMn supports
are responsible for conversion of propylene to acetone over this type
of catalysts. Referring to the report of Liu et al.,44 it can be found that propylene can be converted to the
carbocation intermediate CH3–+CH–CH3 over Brønsted acidic sites, which is then converted
into acetone. In view of the acidity/basicity results in the present
work of Ti-HSMn, indicating a good Brønsted
acidic behavior (Figure S5), one can firmly
propose that the conversion of propylene to acetone over Ag/Ti-HMSn, AgMo/Ti-HMSn, or NaAgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts is mainly
encouraged by Ti-HSMn supports.

On the other
hand, it is clear that doping of Ti-HSMn supports with Ag enhanced their selectivity to PO
and reduced the COx production (Table 2). However, the maximum
selectively to PO observed over Ag/Ti-HMS5 was only 6%
with a conversion of 0.9% (Figure 12b). In addition, the Ag/Ti-HMSn catalysts seemed to exhibit more activity than Ag/HMS in conversion
of DPO to PO (Table 2). Zemichael et al. suggested that K-promoted Ag/CaCO3 catalysts containing silver crystallites of sizes in the range of
20–40 nm produce the maximum PO yield.16 However, the Ag particles in our present work supported either on
neat unmodified HMS or on modified HMS by low amount of titanium (Si/Ti
= 40), with sizes ranging between 5 and 40 nm exhibited very low selectivity
to PO (Figure 13).
On the other hand, Lei et al.13 have reported
that the Ag/Al2O3 catalyst containing smaller
size Ag particles (viz., ∼3.5 nm) displayed higher PO performance.
The TEM and UV–vis results of the present study seemed to run
in good agreement with this finding.13 As
shown in Figure 13, a significant decrease in average particle size of Ag is observed
with the increase of Ti content in the HMS (i.e., with a decrease
of Si/Ti ratio from 40 to 10). Such a decrease in Ag average particle
size is accompanied with a noticeable increase in the catalyst performance
in the production of PO. The maximized PO yield can be referred to
the strong interaction between Ag nanoparticles and surface-exposed
intraframework titanium species, in view of our results of surface
acidity and EDX mapping (cf. Figures 2 and 5). Modification of HMS
with a higher amount of Ti (e.g., Si/Ti ratio = 10), decreased Ag
average particle size to ca. 6.8 nm and led to a clear improvement
in the PO production. Yet, the turnover frequency (TOF) parameter
of 0.065 s–1 for the Ag/Ti-HMS10 catalyst,
calculated as based on the total loaded amount of Ag, is still much
lower than that one reported by Lei et al., namely, 1.0 s–1 for the Ag/alumina.13 In terms of particle
size distribution profiles, one may attribute the discrepancy in TOFs
to the uneven particle size distribution of Ag NPs in the studied
catalysts (being ranged between 5 and 40 nm). Nevertheless, the most
active sample (Ag/Ti-HMS10) had an average size of Ag nanoparticles
in the range of 2–12 nm. It can thus be concluded that the
propylene epoxidation over Ag-based catalysts supported on HMS or
Ti-HMS, at the given operational conditions, is structure-sensitive
with respect to the Ag average particle size.

Figure 13 Dependence of the rate
of PO formation on silver average particle
size for catalysts understudy.

Generally, the role of Ag average particles size seems to be still
unclear in the case of neat Ag-supported catalysts, that is, in the
absence of a promoter (Mo or Na). As shown in Figure 13, the PO yield is slightly increased from
0.0013 to 0.0695 (mol/mol Ag) by reducing the average particle size
from 24.3 to 23.0 nm in the case of Ag/HMS and Ag/Ti-HMS40, respectively. However, a drastic decrease in Ag average particle
size in Ag/Ti-HMS40 from 23.0 to 6.8 nm in Ag/Ti-HMS10 could only slightly enhance the PO yield from 0.0695 to
0.1400 (mol/mol Ag). This may reveal that the role of titanium in
enhancement of catalytic performance of Ag/Ti-HMS40 is
not restricted in decreasing the Ag average particle sizes. On the
other hand, incorporation of a very small amount of Ti into the HMS
can create Lewis acid sites.45 These acid
sites lead to withdrawal of electrons from Ag species, transferring
it to the active electron-deficient (Ag+δ) species.10 The higher selectivity of Ag/Ti-HMS10 to PO than that of Ag/HMS appear thus to be a result of both the
smaller particle sizes of AgNPs and the Lewis acid behavior of Ti-incorporated-HMS
support. According to this discussion, further study seems to be still
needed to solve such confusion.43

In the case of supported AgMo on HMS catalysts, the addition of
MoO3 to Ag/HMS catalysts did not significantly improve
the production of PO (Table 2). However, the addition of Mo to Ag/Ti-HMSn was much more beneficial for the catalyst in enhancing the
% conversion and producing mostly oxygenates (viz., PO and acetaldehyde).
The optimal direct propylene functionality to PO at 400 °C was
achieved by using AgMo/Ti-HMS10. The selectivity to PO
increased by increasing the Ti content at Si/Ti = 10, followed by
a decrease with further increase of Ti content at Si/Ti = 5 in the
catalyst (Figure 12c). Liu et al.44 have reported that some
active electrophilic oxygen species, such as [O–] and [O2–], can be formed during the
adsorption of O2 molecule on the catalyst surface. The
electrophilic oxygen [O2–] attacks the
C=C bond of propylene to form unstable peroxy complexes, which
in turn causes the break of C=C to form acetaldehyde as well
as formic acid that may be oxidized to CO2 and H2O. However, [O–] attacks the C=C bond of
propylene to form PO. On the other hand, Jin et al.10 suggested, from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis
of AgMo/ZrO2 catalyst, that by transfer of an electron
from silver to MoO3, to form Mo oxyanion, Mo will have
a valence of 6 – δ and silver will be electron-deficient
(Ag+δ). They also suggested that Ag in highly oxidative
state was helpful to produce electrophilic oxygen species, which played
a positive role in the propylene epoxidation.5 According to the suggestions of Jin et al.10 and Liu et al.,44 it appears that the
observed higher performance of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 to PO than
that of unmodified AgMo/HMS can be attributed to the coexistence of
smaller Ag particles in subnanometer dimension (of 6.8 nm average
sizes) in AgMo/Ti-HMS10 than in AgMo/HMS (of 24.3 nm average
sizes) together with MoO3 particles encouraging their interaction.
The interaction product (AgxMoyOz phase) was detected
by in situ Raman in AgMo/Ti-HMS10 but not in AgMo/HMS in
the flow of propylene at 400 °C. It seems that Ag+δ species in this AgxMoyOz phase improved the electrophilic
property of adsorbed oxygen on AgMo/Ti-HMS10, therefore
enhancing the DPO to PO and acetaldehyde.

Furthermore, the PO
selectivity was found to decrease significantly
with increasing Ti content (at the lowest Si/Ti molar ratio = 5) in
the case of AgMo/Ti-HMS5 catalyst (Figure 12c). Sugiyama et al.43 also reported that the addition of Ti to Al-Ti-MCM-41 resulted in
an enhancement of the formation of COx. Referring to our UV–vis
results of Ti-HMS5 support, the observed decrease in the
catalytic performance of AgMo/Ti-HMS5 can be ascribed to
the presence of some bulk or extra-framework TiO2 species
(cf., Figure S10). The negative effect
of extra-framework TiO2 species on the performance of titanium
silicate in DPO was previously reported by Lu et al.14 and Wang et al.9 Moreover, Jin
et al.10 attributed the higher performance
of AgMoO3/ZrO2 in DPO to the role of ZrO2 support (as a P-type semiconductor) in acceptance of electrons
from Ag, rendering it to be positively charged species, thus reducing
the negative charge of oxygen (Oads) adsorbed on the silver
surface. Such behavior may hinder the acid–base reaction between
O2(ads) (Lewis base) and allylic hydrogen (Lewis acid)
of propylene, inhibiting most probably the complete oxidation of propylene
and leading to increased selectivity to PO.46 However, the interaction of extra-framework TiO2 species
(as n-type semiconductor) with Ag seems to play an opposite role to
that of ZrO2 (as p-type semiconductor), that is, enhancing
the negative charge of Oads and directing thereby the reaction
toward the deep oxidation of propylene by nucleophilic oxygen, viz.,
leading to less formation of PO. Based on these findings, it can be
concluded that the presence of Ti in an appropriate amount within
the hexagonal mesoporous silica controls the Ag particle sizes, leading
to an improvement of the interaction between Ag and MoO3 and thus enhancing the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 catalyst’s
selectivity to PO.

2.9.2 Different Factors Affecting
the Catalytic
Performance in DPO over AgMo/Ti-HMS10
2.9.2.1 Effect of Reaction Temperature
Figure 14 displays
the effect of reaction temperature on the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 performance in DPO process. By increasing the temperature, the propylene
conversion increased and selectivity to acetone decreased. On the
other hand, the selectivity toward both PO and acetaldehyde increased
with increasing the reaction temperature up to 350 °C. However,
at higher temperatures, for example, at 400 °C, the selectivity
to PO and acetaldehyde decreased. This may be attributed to the formation
of a large amount of COx because of either
complete oxidation or decomposition of propylene. At 350 °C and
space velocity 7500 h–1, the selectivity to PO of
27.9% was achieved with a propylene conversion of 9.0%.

Figure 14 Effect of
reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of
AgMo/Ti-HMS10 for oxidation of propylene at space velocity
7500 h–1 and 0.1 MPa.

2.9.2.2 Effect of Space Velocity
The
effect of the space velocity on the performance of AgMo/Ti-HMS10 in DPO is shown in Figure 15. The propylene conversion decreased with increasing
the space velocity, while the selectivity to PO and acetaldehyde increased.
With a space velocity of 12,000 h–1 at 400 °C,
a selectivity to PO of 43.2% was achieved with a propylene conversion
of 14.1%. The reason behind the increase in selectivity to PO with
increasing the space velocity is obviously that the higher space velocity
shortens the residence time of PO inside the catalyst bed, thus leading
to lower deep oxidation extent of PO to CO2. Under these
reaction conditions, the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 catalyst exhibited
a good catalytic performance in DPO (Table 3), compared with the Ag-based catalysts reported
earlier, especially those Ag catalysts supported on silica and/or
titania.

of Time-on-Stream

course of DPO over AgMo/Ti-HMSi10, where a good stability
of the catalyst in DPO was verified during the reaction time-on-stream

AgMo/Ti-HMSi10 catalysts at 400 °C, space velocity

2.9.2.4 Effect of NaCl
The results of
the effect of NaCl on the catalytic performance of AgMo/Ti-HMSn system in production of PO are presented
in Table 2. The addition
of NaCl has increased the selectivity to PO, but with a significant
decrease of propylene conversion. NaAgMo/Ti-HMS10 achieved
30.3% selectivity to PO, with only a low conversion of 9% at 400 °C
and a space velocity of 7500 h–1 (Table 2). Recalling the UV–vis
and TEM results (Figures 3e and 4d), the low conversion observed
for this catalyst can be attributed to the probable aggregation of
Ag species affected by addition of NaCl to AgMo/Ti-HMS10. Significant changes were detected in the Raman features and TPR
Profile of NaAgMo/Ti-HMSi10. In terms of TPR results, an
increase in the strength of the characteristic peak for reduction
of silver oxide at 248 °C was observed (Figure 6d). This may reveal that more selective silver
oxide (Ag+δ) species exist in the NaAgMo/Ti-HMSi10 sample. However, the in situ Raman results of NaAgMo/Ti-HMSi10 catalyst confirm the formation of Ag2MoO4 as an intermediate by heating of the sample in a flow of
C3H6/He at 400 °C. One may conclude that
NaCl promotes the interaction between silver species and molybdenum
oxide to form selectively Ag+δ,46 which leads to the formation of Ag2MoO4 selective intermediate for DPO to PO over NaAgMo/Ti-HMSi10. The higher selectivity of NaAgMo/Ti-HMSi10 in DPO can
be referred to the role of MoO3 in the formed (Ag2MoO4) intermediate for acceptance of electrons from Ag,
rendering it to be positively charged, thus reducing the negative
charge of oxygen (Oads) adsorbed on the silver surface.
Such behavior may hinder the acid–base reaction between O2(ads) (Lewis base) and allylic hydrogen (Lewis acid) of propylene,
which most probably inhibits the complete oxidation of propylene and
leads to increase selectivity to PO.46−48 The NaAgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts were found to follow the same
trend of the variation of propylene selectivity with change of Si/Ti
ratio as AgMo/Ti-HMSn undoped catalysts
(Figure 12d). The
selectivity to PO increased with increasing Ti content in the catalyst,
attaining the maximum effect at Si/Ti = 10 and then decreasing at
the ratio equal to 5.0.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a significant interaction has been observed between
Ag particles and titanium-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica supports
(Ti-HMS). Incorporating an appropriate amount of titanium in the support
was shown to be necessary to attain a maximum interaction level. The
interaction between Ag particles and titanium seemed to control the
particle sizes of Ag on the Ti-HMS10 support, producing
Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with sizes ranging between 2 and 12 nm. The
Ag/Ti-HMS10 catalyst exhibited higher selectivity toward
direct oxidation of PO by molecular oxygen than Ag/HMS. The higher
selectivity of Ag/Ti-HMS10 to PO than that of Ag/HMS thus
appears to be as a result of both the smaller particle sizes of AgNPs
and the Lewis acid behavior of the Ti-incorporated-HMS support; however,
further study seems to be still needed to solve such confusion.

The addition of MoO3 to Ag/Ti-HMSn has a large positive effect on the selectivity toward PO.
The degree of interaction between Ag and MoO3 in the AgMo/Ti-HMSn catalysts depends on the sizes of silver
particles on Ag/Ti-HMSn systems. The presence
of Ag particles of subnanometer sizes on Ti-HMS support surface seemed
to increase the possibility of formation of Ag–MoO3 interactive selective sites. The involvement of these Ag–MoO3 sites in the reaction with propylene could be successfully
confirmed by the aid of in situ thermo-Raman spectroscopy. The H2-TPR analysis indicated that the presence of Ag centers in
the AgxMoyOz intermediate phases encouraged them
to be more positively charged, whereby the adsorbed oxygen atoms became
more electrophilic and thus facilitated the reaction with the olefinic
carbon of propylene to form PO.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials Synthesis
4.1.1 Synthesis
of Ti-HMS
The titanium-containing
hexagonal mesoporous silica supports, with Si/Ti molar ratios ranged
between 5 and 40, were synthesized by using dodecyl amine as a soft
template.22 A solution of 0.1 mol of tetraethyl
orthosilicate and 0.01–0.025 mol of tetrabutyl orthotitanate
in a mixture of ethanol (0.65 mol) and isopropyl alcohol (0.1 mol)
was first prepared at room temperature. This solution was slowly added
under vigorous stirring for 20 min to the other solution consisting
of dodecyl amine (0.027 mol), water (3.6 mol), and HCl (0.002 mol).
The stirring was continued for 24 h to assist the templating procedure.
The solid was then filtered, washed several times with deionized water,
and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The template was removed
by calcination in air at 650 °C for 5 h. The final product was
denoted as Ti-HMSn, where n is the Si/Ti molar ratio.

4.1.2 Synthesis
of Supported Ag Catalysts
The different Ti-HMSn samples (n = 5, 10, 20, and 40)
loaded with silver (20 wt %) were
prepared by a dry impregnation method.10 To an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (4.979 g) in distilled
water, 12.0 g of the support was slowly added to form a slurry under
vigorous stirring, adopting ultrasonication for homogenization at
room temperature. After 10 min, the slurry was heated up to 80 °C,
dried at 110 °C for 24 h, and then calcined at 400 °C for
4 h to get the finished catalysts (Ag/Ti-HMSn).

4.1.3 Synthesis of Supported
AgMo Catalysts
The different Ti-HMSn supports loaded
with silver (20 wt %) and molybdenum oxide (4 wt %) were furnished
by applying the sequential impregnation method. For this aim, the
AgNO3—support slurry was impregnated with 5 mL of
an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.78 g), using ultrasonication for
homogenization. The rest of the procedure was the same as mentioned
above for obtaining the finished AgMo/Ti-HMSn catalyst samples.

4.1.4 Modification of Catalysts
by Sodium Chloride
The as-synthesized AgMo/Ti-HMSn catalyst
(4.9 g) was mixed with aqueous solutions containing sodium chloride
(1.71 mmol) and then dried at 110 °C for 2 h to produce the modified
Na (2 wt %) AgMo/Ti-HMSn samples.

4.2 Characterization Techniques
Chemical
compositions of catalysts were determined through inductively coupled
argon plasma (ICP) analyses using an iCAP 6500 Duo, Thermo Scientific.
The changes in acidity were demonstrated via the potentiometric titration
method, as expressed in terms of mmol/L g (catalyst sample).24 The XRD measurements were performed by adopting
the Philips X’Pert MPD (multipurpose X-ray diffractometer)
with Cu Kα1,2 radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å),
measuring the 2θ in the range 10–80°. N2 physisorption measurements were carried out using the surface area
analyzer Quanta Chrome Nova 2200. Temperature-programmed reduction
(H2-TPR) was performed in ChemBET 3000, Quantachrome. Freshly
calcined catalyst (100 mg) was subjected to heat treatment (20 °C
min–1 up to 1000 °C) in a flow (85 mL min–1) of a mixture of hydrogen/nitrogen (5/95 vol %).
Transmission electron micrographs were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100
transmission electron microscope operated with an acceleration voltage
of 200 kV (in HR configuration with a 50 mm2 detector).
Images were analyzed using ImageJ 1.41 software. EDX analyses were
recorded using a Quanta FEG 250 microscope and equipped with EDX spectrometer
(TexSEM Laboratories “TSL” EDAX, AMETEK, Inc, USA).
Raman spectroscopic analysis was performed using a Horiba XploRA confocal
Raman microscope (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The XploRA was a fully automated
Raman microscope based on a 200 mm focal length spectrograph with
four fully automated switchable gratings and up to three fully automated
internal lasers. It included a confocal microscope, coupling and filtering
optics, multichannel air-cooled CCD detector (26.6 nm), and computer
package (LabSpec6 spectral software). The XploRA basic configuration
was the same as that of a standard Olympus BX41 microscope supplied
with XY manual mechanical stage and five positions objective turret
equipped with three plan achromatic objectives: 10×, 50×,
and 100×. In addition, it included both a white light illuminator
with a 12 V/100 W lamp with variable light intensity for Koehler illumination
by reflection and a white light illuminator with a 6 V/30 W lamp with
variable light intensity and Abbe condenser for Koehler illumination
by transmission. LabSpec6 spectral software suited for the easy acquisition
and analysis of Raman data, namely, control of the hardware and acquisition
parameters, autocalibration, customizable methods, FLAT fluorescence
subtraction, peak label and fit, image capture, smoothing and spectral
subtraction, and so on. The spectral resolution was 2.5 cm–1 at 532 nm and 1.8 cm–1 at 785 nm. By far, the
most popular wavelength used for Raman spectroscopy is 785 nm, as
it offers the best balance between avoiding fluorescence, absorption
of the laser light (and Raman scattering) by the sample and therefore
heating effects, and the limits to detector sensitivity. In situ measurements
were performed using an X-LINK CATA thermometric cell working in the
range, ambient temperature—1000 °C, with the following
specification: window materials for Raman technique, sample size is
7 mm diameter (between 70 and 100 mg dependent on sample type), standard
size 1/16 gas analyzer high pressure connectors, removable ceramic
sample holder, water cooling to keep stage body at safe temperature
to maintain gases at elevated temperatures, and preventing condensation
before analysis. To reduce the heat over the sample with the laser
beam during spectra acquisition, the full spectra, hereafter shown
for Raman shifts, between 200 and 1200 and 1200 cm–1, were built by accumulating 10 scans during a total time of 100
s. Single crystalline silicon wafer was used to calibrate the Raman
shift frequency during every run, resulting in an uncertainty in the
peak frequency of <2 cm–1. FT-IR measurements
were performed by using Thermo Scientific, Nicolet 6700, at a resolution
of 5.3 cm–1 over the range 4000–400 cm–1. UV–vis measurements were followed up by using
a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer.

4.3 Catalytic
Tests
The catalytic activity
was evaluated in a tubular quartz down flow reactor (6 mm i.d.) placed
inside a programmable furnace.25 The temperature
was measured by a type K thermocouple in the inner tube close to the
catalyst bed. Catalytic tests were carried out for the AgMo/Ti-HMS10 samples of different particle sizes in the range 125–1000
μm. The results showed that the catalyst of particle sizes 180–710
μm exhibited constant conversion without pressure drop, indicating
the absence of external mass-transfer limitations. Typically, 100
mg of the catalyst, ground and sieved to 212–500 μm,
was used in all experiments. The catalyst was diluted with glass beads
to 10 wt % to prevent hot-spot formation, and the reactor was filled
with glass beads over and below the catalyst bed to avoid the gas-phase
homogeneous oxidation reaction. However, at 400 °C, a space velocity
of 7500 or 12000 h–1, and 1 atm in a postcatalytic
bed filled space filled with a glass sphere reactor, a conversion
of less than 1.0% was observed, and the PO selectivity was zero in
the absence of catalyst because of the homogeneous reaction. Therefore,
the data were corrected by subtracting the homogeneous reaction data
obtained. Feed gases were delivered by Cole Parmer compact mass flow
meters. All tubing was heated in order to avoid condensation in the
system. Both the feed and the product gas were analyzed by on-line
gas chromatography (GC), using a Burker GC 450 equipped with three
channels. The first channel was equipped with a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD) and separation was accomplished by HayeSep Q and molecular
sieve 5A for separation of hydrogen. The second channel was also equipped
with TCD for analysis of permanent gases (O2, N2, CO, and CO2) and separation was accomplished by HayeSep
Q and MolSieve 13× columns connected in series. The third channel
was equipped with a flame ionization detector for analysis of propylene
and oxygenates (such as PO, acetone, acrolein, and acetaldehyde).
The separation was accomplished by a HayeSep Q column. The product
gas composition was measured in 20 min intervals, as determined by
the duration of the GC analysis, with intermittent increments of the
furnace temperature. The initial concentrations of propylene and oxygen
were calculated before each catalytic run to verify their constant
values with a 98% degree of confidence and the carbon mass balances
with error were below 5%. The standard reaction conditions were reaction
temperature = 400 °C, 0.1 MPa, and space velocity = 7500 h–1. The feedstock composition consisted of 22.7% propylene,
9.0% oxygen, and the total flow rate was 100 mL/min, balanced with
nitrogen. The product selectivity (%) was defined as the product concentration
× 100 divided by the propylene conversion. The propylene conversion
(%) was estimated as the concentration of propylene consumed/concentration
of propylene in the feed × 100.
