Orexins/hypocretins and their receptors (OXRs) are ubiquitously
distributed throughout the nervous system and peripheral tissues.
Recently, various reports have indicated that orexins play regulatory
roles in numerous physiological processes involved in obesity, energy
homeostasis, sleep–wake cycle, analgesia, alcoholism, learning,
and memory. This review aims to outline recent progress in the research
and development of orexins used in biochemical signaling pathways,
secretion pathways, and the regulation of energy metabolism/adipose
tissue development. Orexins regulate a variety of physiological functions
in the body by activating phospholipase C/protein kinase C and AC/cAMP/PKA
pathways, through receptors coupled to Gq and Gi/Gs, respectively.
The secretion of orexins is modulated by blood glucose, blood lipids,
hormones, and neuropeptides. Orexins have critical functions in energy
metabolism, regulating both feeding behavior and energy expenditure.
Increasing the sensitivity of orexin-coupled hypothalamic neurons
concurrently enhances spontaneous physical activity, non-exercise
activity thermogenesis, white adipose tissue lipolysis, and brown
adipose tissue thermogenesis. With this comprehensive review of the
current literature on the subject, we hope to provide an integrated
perspective for the prevention/treatment of obesity.

==== Body
Background
Obesity is closely associated with dysregulation
of appetite, and the hypothalamus is a key site for neuronal regulation
of food intake. The hypothalamic nucleus is connected by and interdependent
on receiving, integrating, and sending hunger signals to regulate
appetite.1 The central nervous system releases
appetite-stimulating factors, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related
protein (AgRP), orexins, melanin-concentrating hormone, β-endorphin,
γ-aminobutyric acid, and norepinephrine (NE). It also secretes
antiappetite factors such as α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
(a proopiomelanocortin derivative), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
transcript (CART), corticotrophin-releasing hormone, and glucagon-like
peptide-1. Ghrelin is the only appetite-stimulating hormonal signal
from the periphery, and peripheral antiappetite signals include leptin,
insulin, cholecystokinin (CCK), obestatin, and adiponectin.2 Furthermore, the hypothalamus is the most important
site for central regulation of glycolipid metabolism and energy homeostasis,3 and several hormones and neuropeptides in the
hypothalamus modulate or participate in these biological processes.3,4

Orexins are also known as hypocretins, and were originally
identified as appetite-stimulating peptides produced in the lateral
hypothalamus (LH).5 Subsequent research
has indicated that orexin is extensively involved in the physiological
processes of the sleep–wake cycle, analgesia, alcoholism, learning,
and memory.6 The neurons responsible for
producing orexin rapidly perceive the body’s nutritional status
by responding to metabolic signals such as peripheral blood glucose,
as well as leptin and ghrelin levels.7 In
previous studies, both mice deficient in orexin-producing neurons
and orexin-knockout mice demonstrated symptoms of paroxysmal narcolepsy
and delayed obesity, despite reductions in food intake.8 Kakizaki et al. also implied that orexin neurons
are involved in body weight gain via the interactive effects of exercise
and diet, with each orexin receptor playing a unique role.9 These studies suggest that orexin functions as
a regulator of obesity. It is well known that obesity is a result
of an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, manifesting
as excess adipose tissue development, decreased lipolysis, and high
fat storage.9 This review will provide
an integrated perspective for the prevention of obesity, by explaining
the physiological effects of orexins on energy metabolism and adipose
tissue development.

Characteristics and Tissue Distribution of Orexin
The
precursor peptide of orexin (prepro-orexin) gives rise to two neuropeptides
of different lengths: orexin-A and orexin-B. The human prepro-orexin
gene consists of 1432 base-pairs. It contains two exons and one intron,
and it encodes 131 amino-acid (AA) residues. One prepro-orexin generates
one orexin-A and one orexin-B that are 33 AAs and 28 AA peptides,
respectively, sharing 13 common AAs.5c,10 Homology analysis
using a comparison of the AA sequences of prepro-orexin from eight
different animal species (Figure 1) revealed a high degree of homology in mammals (Table 1). Zebrafish and humans
share only 29.5% homology in their prepro-orexin AA sequence, whereas
chickens and humans share 48.9% homology. The AA sequence of orexin-A
is identical, however, between humans, oxen, pigs, and rodents. The
AA sequence of orexin-B is identical in mice and rats, and it differs
from the human sequence by only two residues.11 In addition, the AA sequences of chicken orexin-A and -B showed
about 85 and 65% similarities with their human counterparts.12 The high conservation of orexin-A and orexin-B
among species implies that the proteins serve fundamental and critical
biological functions.

In the central nervous systems of rats,
orexin-containing neurons project to the hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain,
pons, medulla oblongata, cerebral cortex, and limbic system.5b,13 In the LH, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), paraventricular
thalamus, dorsal raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, and periaqueductal
central gray, high orexin contents (orexin-A and orexin-B peptides)
have been found in high concentrations. Moderate orexin concentrations
have been found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SChN), median eminence,
paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), arcuate nucleus (ARC),
supraoptic nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and the substantia
nigra. Orexin-B expression in these tissues have been found to be
2.1–3.0-fold the orexin-A concentrations found in rats.13 In the peripheral nervous system, orexins have
widespread distribution in the sympathetic nerves, testes, heart,
adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, placenta, stomach, intestines,
and in adipose tissues.14

Characteristics and Tissue Distribution of Orexin Receptors
The orexin system contains two G-protein-coupled receptors: the
orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) and the orexin-2 receptor (OX2R).15 In humans, the two OXR mRNAs
consist of 1564 and 1843 base pairs, and these encode 425 and 444
AAs, respectively. Rat OXR mRNAs consist of 2469 and 3114 base pairs,
and they are translated into 416 and 460 AAs, respectively. Humans
and rats share 94 and 95% sequence identity for OX1R and
OX2R, respectively. This indicates that the OXR genes are
highly conserved among species. Furthermore, the AA sequences of human
OX1R and OX2R have 64% homology between them.
Both receptors can bind both orexin-A and orexin-B, but they bind
with different affinities. OX2R is a nonselective receptor,
so it has the same affinity for both orexins. OX1R, however,
is a selective receptor, with a far greater affinity for orexin-A
over orexin-B.5c,11

The distribution of OXRs
is similar to the projection sites of orexin-neurons, but in situ
hybridization results indicate that OX1R and OX2R mRNAs have complementary distributions. OX1R has widespread
distribution in many brain regions involving the VMN, the prefrontal
and infralimbic cortex, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, the
dorsal raphe nucleus, the locus coeruleus, and the hippocampus. OX2R has been observed in a complementary distribution to this,
throughout the septal nuclei, the medial thalamic groups, the raphe
nuclei, the cerebral cortex, and in many hypothalamic nuclei related
to the PVN, the ventral premammillary nucleus, the tuberomammillary
nucleus, and the dorsomedial nucleus (DMN).16 Genes expression results have shown that OX1R mRNA is
predominantly expressed in the VMN, whereas high levels of mRNA are
present in the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, tenia tecta, and the
hippocampal formation. OX2R mRNA has been shown to be most
abundant in the PVN, and is also mainly expressed in the paraventricular
thalamic nuclei, subthalamus, nucleus accumbens, anterior pretectal
nucleus, and in the cerebral cortex, in rats.17 The high expression levels of OXRs in the hypothalamus support their
proposed role in appetite regulation. In the periphery, OX1R mRNA has been found in the pituitary gland, kidneys, adrenal glands,
thyroid, testes, ovaries, and the jejunum. OX2R mRNA has
been detected in the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, and in the lungs,
and particularly high levels of OX2R mRNA have been found
in the adrenal glands of rats.14b

Signal Transduction of Orexins
In neuronal cells, both
OX1R and OX2R are coupled to the Gq class of
G-proteins, with similar signal transductions, resulting in the activation
of phospholipase C (PLC) and the subsequent elevation of intracellular
calcium concentration, leading to neuron excitation.18 Orexins also inhibit K+ channels or activate nonselective
cation channels, resulting in the depolarization of neurons,19 which can in turn lead to increased excitabilities
and firing rates of the neurons.20 Kukkonen
and Åkerman inferred that orexins increased the electrical activities
of neurons via the PLC-PIP2(Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate)
pathway, eliciting both presynaptic (e.g., increased Ca2+ influx) and postsynaptic (e.g., inhibited K+ channels) activated
nonselective cation channel responses or Na+/Ca2+ exchanges.21

Recent studies have
shown that OXRs modulate physiological activities by regulating PLC-activated
Ca2+ channels through either the Gq-coupled receptor or
through intracellular cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) levels
via a Gi/Gs-coupled receptor pathway.22 Adenylate cyclase (AC) and PLC are key enzymes in the G-protein
signaling pathway, and they are both located on the cell membrane.
AC transforms adenosine monophosphate (AMP) into cAMP, thereby activating
protein kinase A (PKA). PLC converts PIP2 to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
(IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which stimulates Ca2+ release
and activates protein kinase C (PKC). PKA and PKC are important intracellular
kinases that transmit signals to the nucleus, thereby regulating gene
and protein expression and playing key roles in multiple physiological
and pathological processes.21,23 Shen et al.24 and Gorojankina et al.25 demonstrated that orexin-A activates extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK),
Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), AC, and PLC, and induces a significant
rise in cAMP, IP3, and intracellular calcium. OX2R-activated
phosphorylation of ERK via the Gq/PLC/PKC, Gi, and Gs/AC/cAMP/PKA
pathways is more potent than OX1R-induced ERK phosphorylation
through the modulation of PKC, PI3K, Ras, and Src. Moreover, OX2R can activate the p38MAPK pathway through AC/cAMP, which
is downstream of Gi/Gs.26 OXRs have also
been shown to connect to multiple Ca2+ signaling mechanisms
in all native and recombinant cell types. Briefly, OXRs, at high orexin
concentrations, activate the typical Gαq → PLC →
IP3 → Ca2+ system (Ca2+ release from
stores), and at lower orexin concentrations, primarily activate the
receptor-operated Ca2+ influx pathway (Gαq →
PLC → DAG → Ca2+ influx from the extracellular
side)22b (Figure 2). Thus, orexins always regulate a variety
of physiological functions in the body by activating PLC/PKC and AC/cAMP/PKA
pathways through receptors coupled to Gq and Gi/Gs, respectively.

Furthermore, some reports have indicated that OX1R may
form homodimers or heterodimers with other G-protein-coupled receptors.
For example, OX1R exists predominantly as a homodimer,
in order to perform potential regulation of receptor organization
in the basal state.27 OX1R can
also dimerize with the cholecystokinin A receptor (CCK1R),
however, and this heterodimer decreases G-protein-dependent signaling
and opposes the migration of human colon cancer cells.28 Xue et al. determined that ghrelin, through
an OX1R and growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a) heterodimer,
upregulated the Gas-cAMP-cAMP-responsive element signaling pathway
and promoted neuroblastoma cell proliferation in vitro.29

Orexins Regulate Food Intake
Previous studies have
shown that the ARC, VMN, DMN, PVN, SChN, and LH all affect feeding
behavior, and together constitute the “core” of the
appetite-regulating network in the hypothalamus. The LH is a key site
of regulation of food intake and energy balance, as evidenced by the
fact that injuries of the LH region result in reductions in food intake
and weight loss.30 A distribution analysis
of orexins and their receptors has revealed that orexin signals cover
the encephalic regions involved in appetite, satiety, and energy homeostasis.13,16 Intracerebroventricular injections of orexin-A and orexin-B have
confirmed that orexins promote food intake in a dose-dependent manner.5c Orexin-A increased daytime feeding in rats,
in one study, but nocturnal feeding was reduced and there was no change
in 24 h food intake on days two and eight under an 8-day intracerebroventricular
infusion with orexin-A (18 nmol/day). Increased feeding in satiated
rats and prolonged feeding in fasted rats which had been administered
a single intracerebroventricular injection of orexin-A (23.4 nmol)
3 or 6 h into the light phase was also observed.31 These observations suggest that orexins may regulate feeding
in some particular cases, such as when circadian rhythms influence
feeding patterns and under conditions of hypoglycemia. The duration
of orexin-A- and orexin-B-stimulated feedings have also been found
to differ. Orexin-A has been found to induce feedings that last for
about 4 h, but orexin-B-induced feedings only last about 2 h.5c The variance in orexin-A- and orexin-B-stimulated
feeding duration may be attributed to the high lipophilicity of orexin-A,
which permits the rapid passage of orexin-A through the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) by simple diffusion. Conversely, orexin-B has low lipophilicity
and cannot pass through the BBB.32 Moreover,
intracerebroventricular injection of orexin-A has promoted behaviors
related to feeding, but orexin-B has not been shown to have similar
effects in rats.33 In this context, many
studies have suggested that orexin-A plays a major role in multiple
orexin-regulated appetite subsystems. In addition, central injection
of mammalian orexin-A or -B did not significantly stimulate food intake
in chicks, in one study.34 Possible reasons
for this may be substantial differences in the peptide sequences and
structures of OXRs and their receptors between mammalian and avian
species.12,35

SB-334867, a selective OX1R antagonist, was found to inhibit feeding behavior and food intake,
elevate the onset of behavioral satiety, and decrease post-treatment
weight gain in one study.36 Rodgers et
al.37 found that SB-334867 increased behavioral
satiety and suppressed the hyperphagic effect of orexin-A in rats,
suggesting that orexin-A stimulates feeding chiefly through OX1R. Orexins promote appetite by stimulating NPY/AgRP neurons
and simultaneously inhibiting the antiappetitive POMC (proopiomelanocortin)/CART
neurons. Evidence in support of this mechanism is that a NPY Y1/5
antagonist completely blocks orexin-A-stimulated food intake in rats.38 Ida et al. found that the regulatory action
of orexin-A on feeding is also related to corticotropin releasing
factor (CRF). Intracerebroventricular injection of CRF suppresses
orexin expression and inhibits orexin-A-stimulated feeding, whereas
intracerebroventricular injection of a CRF antagonist or anti-CRF
serum markedly enhances orexin-A-stimulated feeding. Moreover, an
NPY Y1 receptor antagonist abolishes the increased food intake caused
by CRF antagonist injection with orexin-A in rats.39 The opioid pathway may be also involved in orexin-stimulated
feeding, because a nonselective antagonist of opioid receptors blocks
orexin-stimulated feeding. This is probably due to an effect on the
central pleasure and reward mechanism of feeding behavior.40 Sheng et al. provided direct evidence that the
glucose sensitivities of LH orexin-GI (glucose-inhibited) neurons
influenced reward-based feeding in mice.41 Additionally, intracerebroventricular injection of orexins stimulates
gastric acid secretion by activating the vagus nerve and promoting
the cephalic phase of eating.42 However,
intraperitoneal injection of orexin-A does not promote gastric acid
secretion in rats.43 Feeding-induced stomach
dilation, stomach fulfillment, and release of cholecystokinin-8 rapidly
reduce the expression of orexins in rats.44 Therefore, orexins primarily modulate acute feeding behavior, integrate
multiple metabolic signals, and adapt to the energy demands of the
body by altering wakefulness and feeding behaviors.

Orexins Regulate Energy Expenditure
Orexins not only
modulate appetite regulation, but they also control energy expenditure.
The balance between food intake and energy expenditure determines
long-term energy homeostasis. Daily energy expenditure in animal always
includes exercise, nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), thermoregulation,
thermic effects of food, and basal metabolic rate (BMR).45 Lubkin and Stricker-Krongrad reported that injection
of orexin-A into the third ventricles of mice brains increased the
mice’s BMRs independent of physical activity, but that orexin-B
did not show such an effect.46 In fact,
orexins are critical central neuropeptides for the regulation of NEAT.
High-fat diets decreased spontaneous physical activity (SPA) and NEAT
in mice, and the activation of orexin neurons abolished this decrease
and produced an increase in NEAT.47 Orexin-A
was microinjected through an intraventricular cannula into the hypothalamic
paraventricular nuclei of diet-induced obese (DIO) or diet-resistant
(DR) rats in one study, and energy expenditure was measured for 2
h. The results revealed that NEAT was significantly increased in the
DR rats as compared to DIO rats.48 The
probable cause was that the DR rats had higher sensitivities to orexin-A,
which promoted SPA, along with a subsequent increase of oxygen consumption
and CO2 production, which in turn increased NEAT. Conversely,
the DIO rats lacked NEAT, and their obesities caused reductions in
their sensitivities to orexin-A. Similar results have shown that dual
orexin receptor antagonists reduce orexin-A-induced increases in SPA,
total energy expenditure, and NEAT during SPA, wake, rest, and sleep
in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.49 In
addition to increasing energy expenditure by enhancing NEAT, orexins
also regulate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis.50 Injection of orexins into the rat rostral raphe
pallidus has been shown to increase BAT, CO2 production,
and thermogenesis.51 Mice that have undergone
ablation of orexin neurons present with BAT dysfunction and have increased
fat masses, which can be modulated through intracerebroventricular
injections of orexin-A to activate BAT thermogenesis, increasing their
body temperatures and reducing adiposity.52 Yoshimichi et al. also reported an increase in body temperature
caused by a central injection of orexin-A in rats under anesthesia,
with no feeding or physical activity.53 These studies show that orexins can increase energy expenditure
by producing increases in BMR, NEAT, and thermoregulation, and that
orexin-A plays a dominant role in this process. Furthermore, the orexin-activated
GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 cells) network in the LH has
been shown to maintain healthy levels of physical activity in mice.54

In fact, the neuromodulation of energy
metabolism by orexins is a complicated and integrated process that
involves several brain regions. Following the injection of orexins
into the rostral LH, tuberomammillary nucleus, substantia nigra, dorsal
raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus accumbens, and hypothalamic
paraventricular nucleus, orexins have been found to improve SPA and
NEAT. Meanwhile, numerous brain regions involved in regulatory networks
of food intake also participate in the NEAT network or in other aspects
of energy expenditure.17,48,51,55 These instances, and the widespread distribution
of orexins and OXRs throughout the brain, indicate that the orexin
systems of different brain regions may control some of the same functions,
and that the outcomes of the orexin system result from activation
of OXRs in corresponsive brain regions via projections of orexins.

Central Orexins Affect Adipose Development
As is well
known, two types of adipose tissue—white adipose tissue (WAT)
and BAT—exist in mammals.56 WAT
is mainly responsible for metabolic energy storage, whereas BAT maintains
body temperature through its thermogenic activity, by dissipating
energy.57 Orexin-A knockout mice show late-onset
obesity despite no significant change in food intake.58 Transgenic mice that synthesize orexin-A during growth
are resistant to diet-induced obesity.59 Perez-Leighton et al.60 demonstrated
that the injection of orexin-A into the lateral thalamus of SD rats
for 10 consecutive days reduced diet-induced obesity without affecting
food intake. During these processes, orexin-A regulates WAT lipolysis
and energy utilization by increasing SPA60 and sympathetic innervation.61 Shen et
al. injected orexin-A into rat ventricles in two doses, and found
that high doses of orexin-A promoted WAT lipolysis, whereas low doses
reduced WAT lipolysis.55a The reason for
this is that high doses of orexin are more likely to affect relevant
brain sites, increasing sympathetic stimulation of WAT and thereby
increasing lipolysis, whereas lower doses of orexin-A reduce lipolysis
by suppressing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).
Shen et al.55a subsequently reported that
higher doses of orexin-A stimulated histamine secretion, by stimulating
the histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus in order
to promote lipolysis. These findings suggest that central orexins
accelerate lipolysis and energy utilization in WAT. Another recent
study also discovered that orexin neurons in the LH are functional
and integrative factors that regulate the browning of WAT.62

Central orexins play integral roles in
adaptive thermogenesis and body weight regulation, via effects on
BAT differentiation and function. Sellayah et al.63 demonstrated that orexins and their receptors are indispensable
in the development of BAT, because they induced brown adipose cell
differentiation through the activation of P38-MAPK in mice. In a subsequent
study by Sellayah and Sikder,64 orexin-knockout
mice rapidly increased in body weight and showed markedly lower triglyceride
accumulation in BAT tissue compared to wild-type mice. Meanwhile,
Sellayah et al. found that both OX1R and OX2R knockout mice also had increased body weights and reduced triglyceride
accumulations, and that OX1R knockout showed the most pronounced
effects.64 This is due to the inhibition
of thermogenesis, resulting from orexin-induced BAT dysfunction and
the abnormal accumulation of energy stores in the body from late-onset
pathological obesity.8a Therefore, regular
secretion of orexins and their receptors in BAT prevent obesity caused
by abnormal thermogenesis. Recent studies have shown that BAT is also
densely innervated by the SNS, and can release NE, stimulating thermogenesis
via mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).57b,63,65 From the findings of these studies, we composed
a possible model for the action of central orexins on adipose development,
shown in Figure 3.
This model indicates that central orexins activate the SNS and promote
browning and lipolysis in WAT, and improved UCP1 expression and thermogenesis
in BAT, thus decreasing fat mass.

tissue. Abbreviations: WAT: white adipose tissue; BAT: brown adipose
tissue; SNS: sympathetic nervous system; UCP1: uncoupling protein

Peripheral Orexins Affect Adipose Tissues
Compared
to the in vivo effects of orexins, in vitro treatment of adipose tissue
with orexins shows different functions. Digby et al.66 first discovered orexins and their receptors, OX1R and OX2R, in human adipose tissues. They also found
that treatment with orexin-A and orexin-B significantly affected the
expression of hormone-sensitive lipase, and glycerol release. These
results suggested that orexins play an important role in lipolysis
and adipogenesis. Subsequently, Skrzypski et al.67 demonstrated that orexin-A promoted glucose uptake and
triacylglycerol content, and decreased the release of glycerol in
cultured rat adipocytes. Peripheral orexins have similar effects on
the adipose tissues of pigs. OXRs are expressed in both porcine preadipocytes
and adipocytes.68 Orexins promote the proliferation
and differentiation of porcine preadipocytes through increasing lipid
accumulation, suppressing glycerol release and upregulating the expression
of proadipogenic genes.68a However, orexin-A
(but not orexin-B) regulates lipid metabolism, including suppressing
glycerol release and increasing glucose uptake, in porcine adipocytes.68b These findings indicate that orexins promote
fat deposition by reducing lipolysis and improving adipogenesis and
that orexin-A fully participates in these biological processes in
vitro.

As glucose supports a related source for adipogenesis,
Skrzypski et al.67 cultured isolated rat
adipocytes using orexin-A and discovered that orexin-A further enhanced
glucose uptake, with time- or concentration-dependent increases in
glucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to orexin-A. LY294002,
an inhibitor of PI3K, blocked orexin-A-stimulated glucose uptake in
two kinds of adipocytes. Orexin-A also increased the phosphorylation
of protein kinase B (AKT) which is a PI3K downstream effector protein.
Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), a distinct glucose transport protein,
always translocates from the cytoplasm into the plasma membrane when
activated. To further verify the role of PI3K-AKT, using immunofluorescence,
Skrzypski et al.67 found significant GLUT4
translocation from the cytoplasm into the cell periphery in adipocytes
exposed to orexin-A, but also found that LY294002 prevented this GLUT4
translocation. Orexin-A also induced increased phosphorylation of
AS160, which is downstream of AKT, and stimulated GLUT4 translocation
in its phosphorylated state. In addition, LY294002 inhibited orexin-A-induced
adipogenesis, including increased triacylglycerol content and the
conversion of glucose into nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and orexin-A-inhibited
lipolysis instance glycerol release in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.67 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ
(PPARγ) plays a key role in triacylglycerol accumulation and
the regulation of adipocyte-specific genes, with PPARγ2 being
the major isoform in adipocytes.69 After
incubation of human adipocytes with 100 nmol of orexin-A, Digby et
al.66 detected a significant increase in
PPARγ2 mRNA expression of 1.5-fold. Orexin-A also enhanced PPARγ2
levels in isolated rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, along with
stimulation of adiponectin secretion and cellular triacylglycerol
accumulation. The PPARγ2 antagonist BADGE (bisphenol A diglycidyl
ether) and knocking out of PPARγ2 both blocked these effects.67 These studies suggest that orexin-A stimulates
cellular triacylglycerol accumulation mainly by mediating PI3K-AKT
and PPARγ2 in adipocytes.

Factors that Influence the Secretion of Orexins
The
orexin neurons are glucose-sensitive neurons. Their functions are
suppressed by elevated blood glucose levels, whereas reduced blood
glucose levels excite these neurons. In cultured rat hypothalamic
neurons undergoing a reduction in glucose concentration from 8.3 to
2.8 mmol/L, 41% showed significant increases in Ca2+ influx.
These results indicate that orexin neurons are glucose-sensitive and
that they can translate energy status into neural signals.70 Fasting causes low blood glucose, upregulates
the expression of orexin mRNA in the hypothalamus, and increases the
phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein in orexin-responsive
neurons. This suggests that these neurons have functional responses
to feeding status. Intraperitoneal injections of insulin and 2-DG
(2-deoxy-d-glucose) cause hypoglycemia in animals and lower
glucose levels in cells; these two starving stimuli can both induce
the expression of orexin-A. The function of orexin-A is closely associated
with the type of stimulation. For example, acute stimulation, such
as intraperitoneal injection of 2-DG, is suitable for studying neuronal
activation, whereas chronic stimulation, such as fasting, is suitable
for studying changes in orexin-A expression after neuronal activation.33 However, Iqbal et al.71 demonstrated that long-term feeding restrictions in sheep did not
affect the expression of prepro-orexin. This finding suggests that
orexin neurons may have increased sensitivities to reduced blood glucose,
but are insensitive to chronic hypoglycemia.

A high-fat diet
stimulates the expression of orexins in the perifornical hypothalamus,
and this is highly correlated with increases in the concentrations
of triglycerides in the blood.72 Intravenous
injection of triglycerides in normal rats with fixed levels of leptin,
blood glucose, and insulin stimulates the expression of orexin mRNA.
This result demonstrates that orexin neurons are sensitive to triglycerides.72 Orexins may explain high-fat diet-induced eating,
and the consequent development of obesity. Orexins are stimulated
by increased circulating lipids during a positive energy balance,
and are also stimulated by decreased blood glucose levels during a
negative energy balance.

Leptin is a polypeptide hormone secreted
by adipose tissues that reduces energy intake and increases energy
metabolism. It alleviates symptoms of obesity by enhancing the secretion
of endogenous insulin and lowering blood glucose levels.73 Orexin neurons express the leptin receptor,
and exogenous leptin can downregulate the level of orexins in rat
LHs, which suggests that leptin inhibits the expression of orexins.
However, increased levels of leptin are often accompanied by an upregulation
of orexins in high-fat DIO rats.72 Thus,
it is possible that leptin is not the key factor regulating the expression
of orexins. Ghrelin is an acylated polypeptide secreted by both the
hypothalamus and the stomach, which regulates appetite. It has been
shown that ghrelin enhances the expression of orexins via NPY and
AgRP.74 Additionally, exercise also stimulates
the activities of orexin neurons in mice.75

Conclusions
In summary, orexins, important neuropeptides
in the hypothalamus for regulating appetite and energy homeostasis
efficiently, are involved in multiple physiological functions, such
as sleep–wake cycle and analgesia, to name a few, through the
widespread distribution of their receptors. In addition, orexins slow
the onset of diet-induced obesity by enhancing the sensitivity of
orexin-coupled hypothalamic neurons and simultaneously increasing
NEFA, WAT lipolysis, and BAT thermogenesis. A selective antagonist
of the orexin receptor OX1R, SB-334867, suppresses food
intake and feeding behaviors, leading to weight loss. It is suggested
that a potential approach for the effective treatment of obesity may
involve an OX1R antagonist. Orexins stimulate complex peripheral
signaling pathways, and their involvements as neuropeptides in the
regulation of neural activities are also complicated. However, further
studies on orexins should focus on their intracellular signal transduction
mechanisms and their interactions with other neuropeptides, in order
to provide insights regarding the prevention of metabolic disorders
such as anorexia, obesity, and diabetes.
