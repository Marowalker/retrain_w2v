A new
approach to develop novel hollow urchinlike copper oxide
(CuO) microspheres by the hydrothermal method was reported, and zwitterionic
alkyldimethylbetaine (BS) surfactants were employed as templates in
the classic copper–ammonia complex systems. Effects of numerous
environmental factors on the morphology of CuO particles were studied
systematically, in which the concentration and structure of BS predominantly
affected the developed CuO materials. It was noticed that hollow urchinlike
CuO microspheres were generally formed in the presence of BS regardless
of the reaction temperature and time and the source of copper ions.
Generally speaking, high concentrations of BS and BS with longer chain
length strongly favored the formation of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres.
The microstructures of synthesized CuO particles were studied in detail,
and the corresponding formation mechanism of hollow urchinlike CuO
microspheres was also proposed based on the selective adsorption of
BS on the particular crystal facets of CuO crystals. Moreover, hollow
urchinlike CuO microspheres showed excellent performance in the lithium-ion
batteries as anode materials with a reversible capability of 511 mA
h·g–1 at 0.1 C after 40 charge–discharge
cycles, which was one of the best values of CuO materials reported
in this field.

Introduction
Functional nano-/micromaterials attracted much attention because of their significant
advantages in various fields including electron, biotechnology, medicine,
catalysis, and so forth.1−8 Transition metal oxides such as those of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Mn
are one category of the most attracting anode materials in lithium-ion
batteries and thereby were studied widely.9−18 Beyond the inherent nature or limitation of materials themselves
on the performance, their morphological characteristics were of great
importance. It was well-known that the theoretical
capability of CuO anode materials is as high as 670 mA h·g–1; however, the reversible capability of commercial
CuO powders was often far lower than the theoretical one,19 that is, below 200 mA h·g–1. Wang and co-workers20,21 studied the effect of morphological
characteristics of CuO particles on the performance in the lithium-ion
batteries and found out that those with particular microstructures,
that is, three-dimensionally (3D) hierarchical CuO microspheres, could
enhance both the capability and stability dramatically. In addition,
the employment of composite materials was an alternative route to
overcome the disadvantage, which showed a promising potential in this
area. For example, the capability and stability of Co3O4/CuO composites with a suitable molar ratio as anode materials
were much superior to that of either Co3O4 or
CuO materials.22 However, the importance
of materials with particular microstructures still remained. In other
words, the corresponding performance could be enhanced through adjusting
the morphological structures of materials further. Generally speaking,
materials with 3D hierarchical and hollow microstructures benefited
the performance, as mentioned in several recent works.23−26 Wang et al. developed a multilayer CuO@NiO hollow spheres based
on the Cu–Ni bimetallic organic frameworks, which showed excellent
electrochemical properties because the special hollow structure could
overcome the critical volume expansion well.27 Nowadays, numerous methods have been developed to synthesize functional
materials with novel microstructures,9,10,12,20,27 whereas it is still challenging to develop them in a controlled
manner.

Surfactants often show inherent adsorption and self-assembly
behaviors
at the interface and in the bulk phase, respectively, which endow
them with the essential characteristics in wetting and spreading,
solubilization, emulsification, foaming, and so forth, and thereby
widely used in daily life, agriculture, and industry. Moreover, surfactants
also showed a promising potential in controlling the formation of
nano-/micromaterials with particular microstructures.28 For example, the classic cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) was widely employed as a template to develop functional
inorganic and metal materials such as mesoporous silicon dioxide and
gold particles with various morphologies, respectively.29−31 Moreover, a slight chemical structure variation of surfactants might
affect the appearance of developed materials significantly. Lohse
et al. reported that the alteration of halide counterions of CTAB
could result in gold nanoparticles with rich morphologies.32 Similarly, the hydrophobic chains and headgroups
of surfactants also affected the formed materials dramatically.33−38 Undoubtedly, these works showed the importance of surfactants as
templates in this field. The zwitterionic alkyldimethylbetaine (BS)
surfactants were widely used in the daily chemical products because
of low skin irritation, excellent soil release and biodegradation,
and so forth.39 However, they were rarely
applied in the development of functional materials. Recently, our
group reported a high-efficient and conveniently recyclable photodegradation
membrane, in which cetyldimethylbetaine (BS-16)-assisted urchinlike
CuO microparticles were the key.40 This
work evidently confirmed the feasibility of BS surfactants in the
controlled growth of CuO materials well.

In this work, novel
hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres were developed
from the classic copper–ammonia complex system by the hydrothermal
method in the presence of BS surfactants including BS-10, BS-12, and
BS-14. Effects of numerous factors, in terms of the reaction temperature
and time, the source of copper ions, the molar ratio between surfactant
and copper salt, and the hydrophobic chain length of BS, on the formation
of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres were studied in detail. Accordingly,
the general formation mechanism was also proposed. The microstructures
of developed CuO crystals were studied by scanning and transmission
electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques
systematically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example
about the zwitterionic BS surfactant-assisted formation of hollow
urchinlike CuO microspheres currently.35−38,41,42 According to the particular microstructural
characteristics of the developed hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres,
they were applied in the lithium-ion batteries as anode materials.

Results
and Discussion
BS-12-Assisted Formation of Hollow Urchinlike
CuO Microspheres
A study was carried out about the
formation mechanism of CuO nano-/micromaterials by the hydrothermal
method in different systems, and numerous factors, such as temperature,
time, the source of copper ions, ligands, pH, additives, and so forth,
could strongly affect the physicochemical properties of developed
CuO materials including their morphology and reaction activity.43 In this work, all CuO materials were developed
in the classic copper–ammonia complex system in the presence
of BS surfactants, and the formation was mainly depended on the following
three interrelated reactions.44−46 1   2   3  

The SEM image (Figure 1a) showed that the CuO microspheres developed
in the presence of BS-12 were generally uniform both in size and morphology,
which were urchinlike with the major size about 2–4 μm.
These urchinlike CuO microspheres were the agglomerates of densely
packed rodlike CuO particles with a hollow core, as shown in the inset
image of Figure 1a.
Moreover, these rodlike CuO particles are composed of smaller subunits,
CuO nanopatches, and similar observation was also reported previously.40Figure 1b showed the TEM image of a single CuO microsphere about 3
μm, in which the cross-linked rodlike CuO subunits with width
about tens of nanometers were observed clearly at the edge of particle.
The HRTEM image (Figure 1c) showed its characteristic facet with the lattice fringe spacing d of 0.25 nm, corresponding to the {002} facet of CuO crystals,
which was also visible in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern of the sample (the inset image in Figure 1c). Figure 1d showed the corresponding XRD patterns of the developed
hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres, in which all characteristic diffraction
peaks were consistent with the standard monoclinic structure of CuO
crystals well (PDF# 05-0661). Thus, the HRTEM, XRD, and SAED results
confirmed that the developed CuO materials were well-crystallized.

TEM (b), HRTEM image (c), and XRD pattern (d) of hollow
urchinlike CuO microspheres. The enlarged image in (a) is the hollow
characteristic and the inset image in (c) is the corresponding SAED
pattern.

Figure 2a showed
the typical XPS spectrum of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres, in
which the concerned elements including Cu, O, C, and N were all observed. Figure 2b–d showed
the corresponding Gaussian curve-fitting spectra of Cu 2p3/2, O 1s, and C 1s, respectively. Obviously, there presented three
typical peaks including the dominant peak at 933.7 eV and two shake-up
peaks at 941.1 and 943.3 eV, respectively, in the Cu 2p3/2 spectrum (Figure 2b), which were the primary characteristics of copper in the crystal
CuO.40,47,48 The peaks
with the binding energy of 529.6, 531.2, and 532.6 eV in the O 1s
spectrum (Figure 2c)
were often attributed to the Cu–O, O–O, and O–H
bonds,40,49 respectively, suggesting the formation of
CuO as well. Unlike the weak signal of N 1s (Figure 2a), the characteristic peaks of C 1s was
distinguished apparently, as shown in Figure 2c, because of its relatively abundant content
in the adsorbed BS-12 molecules in comparison with that of N.50 Undoubtedly, the XPS results confirmed the formation
of crystal CuO and the presence of BS-12 on the surface of CuO microspheres
through adsorbing, and a similar observation was also reported previously.40 The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS)
mapping images shown in Figure 2e–i also supported the presence of BS-12 on them. It
was also noticed that the typical stretching vibration peaks of BS-12
were still remained in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum
of the synthesized CuO powders (Supporting Information Figure S1a), and the corresponding TG result (Supporting Information Figure S1b) showed that a clear weight
loss about 3.5% happened between 200 and 320 °C mainly owing
to the thermal-induced degradation of BS-12.51,52 All results suggested the presence of BS-12 on the formed CuO particles,
indicating the importance of BS-12 on the formation of hollow urchinlike
CuO microspheres.

Effect Factors on the Formation
of CuO Microspheres
To make a better understanding on the
formation mechanism of the
interesting hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres, numerous factors including
the reaction temperature and time, the source of copper ions, the
molar ratio between BS-12 and copper salt, and the hydrophobic chain
length of BS-12 homologies were studied in detail. It was noticed
that the employed reaction temperatures such as 100, 130, and 160
°C showed limited effect on the morphology of formed CuO particles
(Figure 1a and Supporting Information Figure S2), and their
urchinlike nature remained regardless of temperature. Similarly, the
formation of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres seemed to be independent
on the reaction time (Supporting Information Figure S3), whereas the reaction time affected the yield of products
strongly and the time of 8 h was enough. Accordingly, the reaction
temperature of 130 °C and the time of 12 h were typically employed
in this work. Moreover, the formation of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres
was commonly observed in the presence of BS-12 regardless of the source
of copper ions including CuCl2, CuSO4, Cu(NO3)2, and Cu(CH3COO)2 (Figure 1a and Supporting Information Figure S4). Measurements
of UV–vis spectra (Supporting Information Figure S5) showed that the electrostatic interactions between BS-12
and copper ions were essential in the CuCl2/BS-12 binary
system. In other words, the introduction of BS-12 affected the copper–ammonia
complex ions slightly, as mentioned in eq 1, and thereby generally resulting in the formation
of CuO microspheres. However, the presence of the surfactant predominantly
affected the microstructure of CuO microspheres.

Molar Ratio
of CuCl2/BS-12
Figure 3 showed the effect of surfactant
concentration on the morphology of the developed CuO microspheres,
in which the concentration of CuCl2, reaction temperature,
and time were all kept constant, whereas the molar ratio r of [CuCl2]/[BS-12] was decreased gradually. Obviously,
mainly irregular and defective CuO microspheres, the agglomerates
of platelike CuO subunits, were formed in the absence of BS-12 (Figure 3a). Moreover, those
platelike particles were composed of smaller CuO particles, as reported
previously.40 However, the morphologies
of CuO microspheres were improved significantly once BS-12 was introduced
into the system even with a small amount. It was noticed that relatively
regular CuO microspheres with a more rough surface were formed when
the value of r = 3/1 was employed (Figure 3b). In particular, the wide
and thick platelike CuO subunits became narrower and thinner simultaneously.
The tendency was further strengthened upon continuously decreasing
the value of r through increasing the concentration
of BS-12. It should be mentioned that typical hollow urchinlike CuO
microspheres composed of rodlike CuO subunits were generally formed
once r was below 1/2 (Figures 1a and 3d–f).
Clearly, to facilitate the composed subunits of CuO, the microspheres
becoming narrower and thinner was one of the most important characteristics
of BS-12.

Figure 3 SEM images of CuO microspheres developed in the absence (a) and
presence (b–f) of BS-12; images (b–f) represent the
molar ratio of [CuCl2]/[BS-12] of 3/1, 1/1, 1/3, 1/5, and
1/7, respectively. Bars represent 1 μm.

Hydrophobic Chain Length of BS Surfactants
The effect
of hydrophobic chain length of BS-12 homologies including BS-10 and
BS-14 on the morphologies of CuO microspheres was also studied, as
shown in Supporting Information Figures
S6 and S7, respectively. Similar morphological transitions of the
developed CuO microspheres as that shown in Figure 3 were also observed in the presence of either
BS-10 or BS-14. Figure 4 showed three typical CuO microspheres synthesized in the presence
of BS-10 (Figure 4a),
BS-12 (Figure 4b),
and BS-14 (Figure 4c) with r = 1/2, respectively. Obviously, no significant
difference was observed from their macroappearance. However, a distinguishing
difference still presented that the subunits of hierarchical CuO microspheres
formed in the presence of BS-12 and BS-14 were relatively uniform
and rodlike, whereas large amounts of platelike ones still remained
in the BS-10-assisted CuO microsphere. Indeed, CuO microspheres fabricated
in the BS-10-containing systems were often irregular and defective
(Supporting Information Figure S6), and
the platelike CuO subunits were commonly presented even in the presence
of high concentration of BS-10, that is, r = 1/8.
In contrast, mainly regular CuO microspheres composed of rodlike CuO
subunits were observed in the BS-12- and BS-14-containing systems
when r was arrived at 1/2 and 1/1, respectively.
In other words, BS-12 and BS-14 were more efficient in assisting the
formation of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres.

Figure 4 SEM images of CuO microspheres
synthesized in the presence of BS-10
(a), BS-12 (b), and BS-14 (c), respectively. Bars represent 500 nm.

The SEM results evidently confirmed
that BS surfactants played
a similar function during the formation of 3D hierarchical urchinlike
CuO microspheres, owing to their similar physicochemical characteristics
from both adsorption and aggregation aspects. However, the capability
of them in controlling the morphology of CuO microspheres was depended
on the hydrophobic chain length strongly. Concentration-dependent
surface tension measurements (Supporting Information Figure S8) showed that the critical micelle concentration significantly
decreased about 100 times from BS-10 to BS-14, and the equilibrium
surface tensions also decreased about 6 mN/m simultaneously. The results
strongly suggested that the BS surfactant with the longer hydrophobic
chain length highly benefited the enhancement of adsorption and aggregation
capability because the van der Waals interactions between BS molecules
were strengthened upon increasing the hydrophobic chain length of
the BS surfactant.

Thus, the BS-assisted formation of CuO microspheres
from the copper–ammonia
complex systems can be generally illustrated by Scheme 1 based on the selective adsorption of BS
surfactant on the particular facet of CuO crystal.53 In the absence of BS surfactants, the initially produced
CuO nanocrystals preferred to grow along with {100} and {010} facets
to form relatively larger and thick platelike CuO subunits because
the ammonia molecules can selectively passivate the {001} facet of
primary CuO nanocrystals because of its highest surface energy.53 As a result, these platelike CuO assembled into
hierarchical CuO microspheres through agglomerating directly for the
purpose of energetic minimum.

Scheme 1 Representative Formation Processes
of CuO Microspheres in the Absence
(Route 1) and Presence (Route 2) of BS Surfactants
Comparing BS surfactants with ammonia molecules,
the adsorption
capability of the former ones was much stronger attributing to the
electrostatic interaction between copper ions and the carboxylate
moiety of BS surfactants. As a result,
BS surfactants, instead of ammonia molecules, were to be adsorbed
in prior on the facets of primary CuO nanocrystals along with the
order from {001}, {100} to {010} facet.53 Correspondingly, the growth of primary CuO nanocrystals was preferred
to adapt a confining manner along some particular directions, that
is, the {100} and {010} facet, resulting in CuO subunits with the
smaller size. Once the adsorption
of BS surfactants on the {001} and {100} facets was arrived, the saturation
upon sostenuto increasing the concentration of surfactant, the primary
CuO nanocrystals would mainly grow along with the {010} facet, a facet
with the lowest energy, and thereby result in the formation of rodlike
CuO particles. Then, those rodlike ones further assembled into hollow
urchinlike CuO microspheres. Since van der Waals interactions between
BS-10 molecules were the smallest because of the short hydrophobic
chain length, the intensity of the adsorbed surfactant layer on the
CuO nanocrystals should be relatively weaker. In other words, the
passivation degree of CuO nanocrystal facets was limited, resulting
in partially confining the growth of CuO nanocrystals. However, the
intensity of adsorbed BS-12 or BS-14 layer was strong enough, and
the {001} and {100} facets of CuO nanocrystals were completely passivated,
which ensured the confining growth along the {010} facet. Therefore,
hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres with structurally well-defined
microstructures were formed in these conditions.

Application
of Hollow Urchinlike CuO Microspheres in Electrochemistry
As a typical transition metal oxide, CuO materials were widely
employed in lithium-ion batteries as anode materials with excellent
performance.20,21,43 Recent work by Lu and co-workers showed that 3D hierarchical nano-/micromaterials
with hollow characteristics were essential in endowing them with new
functionalities for a better lithium storage and effectively accommodate
the volume expansion for anode materials in lithium-ion batteries.54 Certainly, these hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres
might also shed some promising potential in this area owing to their
particular size and microstructure. To avoid the influence of adsorbed
surfactants, samples were treated at 350 °C according to the
TG result (Supporting Information Figure
S1b) for 2 h to ensure the complete decomposition of BS-12. The corresponding
electrochemical performance of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres
developed in the presence of BS-12 is shown in Figure 5.

CuO microspheres.

curves (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 20th), (c) cycling performance and
Coulombic efficiency at 0.1 C rate, and (d) rate performance.

Figure 5a showed
the initial three cyclic voltammograms of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres.
Clearly, three typical cathodic peaks at 1.81 V (weak), 0.97 V (strong),
and 0.75 V (medium) were visible in the first cathodic scan process
corresponding to the following three reactions55−57 4   5   6  

Furthermore, two oxidation peaks at 2.45 V (strong) and 2.74
V
(weak) appeared during the first anodic scan process because of the
formation of Cu2O and CuO, respectively, corresponding
to the following two reactions58 7   8  

Both Cu and Li2O were produced during the cathodic scan
process, resulting in the formation of solid electrolyte interface
film on the surface of hollow urchinlike CuO materials. Correspondingly,
the irreversible cathodic peaks between 0.5 and 1.5 V appeared in
the following charge–discharge process, which was also observed
from the galvanostatic discharge–charge curves of hollow urchinlike
CuO microspheres (Figure 5b) recorded at a rate of 0.1 C in the voltage range of 0.02–3.0
V. Figure 5b showed
three typical plateaus in different voltage ranges from 2.5 to 1.5,
2.5 to 1.0, and 1.0 to 0.2 V, respectively, corresponding to the formation
of CuII1–xCuIxO1–x/2, Cu2O, and Cu and Li2O, according to the above-mentioned
reactions (eqs 7 and 8). The cycling performance and Coulombic efficiency
results (Figure 5c)
showed that the initial charge and discharge capacities were 1019
and 525 mAh·g–1, respectively, with a Coulombic
efficiency of 51.5%. Afterward, both charge and discharge capacities
slightly varied around 530 mAh·g–1 reversibly
with the Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. The reversible capacity of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres remained
as high as 511 mAh·g–1 after 40 cycle processes,
suggesting their excellent cyclic stability. The rate-performance
results (Figure 5d)
showed that the capability was decreased gradually upon increasing
the current density from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.5, and 1 C, whereas the capability
returned reversibly to its original one, once the current density
was decreased to 0.1 C, suggesting its excellent rate capability.
It should be mentioned that the value of 511 mAh·g–1 is one of the highest capabilities reported for CuO materials under
similar conditions,20,21,59,60 which evidently confirmed the application
potential of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres in the lithium-ion
batteries.

Conclusions
In summary, structurally
novel 3D hierarchical CuO microspheres
with hollow urchinlike microstructures were successfully developed
by employing BS surfactants as templates. It was noticed that the
BS-assisted formation of hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres was common
regardless of the reaction temperature and time and the source of
copper ions. However, the molar ratio of [Cu2+]/[BS] and
the hydrophobic chain length of BS affected the morphologies of CuO
particles much. Generally speaking, high concentrations of BS and
BS with longer chain length strongly favored the formation of hollow
urchinlike CuO microspheres obviously. Moreover, the corresponding
formation mechanism was also proposed based on the selective adsorption
of BS surfactants on the CuO crystal facets. Attributing to their
particular characteristics, these hollow urchinlike CuO microspheres
showed excellent performance in lithium-ion batteries as anode materials.
In particular, the reversible
capability was as high as 511 mA h·g–1 under
the current density of 0.1 C after 40 charge–discharge cycles,
which was one of the best values for CuO materials in this field.20,21,59,60 The present work not only provided important fundamental information
in developing surfactant-assisted 3D hierarchical CuO but also showed
a promising application potential in the energy field with better
performance. According to our work and other related works on the
photocatalyst of CuO materials,40,42 the developed hollow
urchinlike CuO microspheres might also show excellent potential in
the field of environmental conservation.

Experimental Section
Materials
BS surfactants including BS-10, BS-12, and
BS-14 were synthesized according to the same procedure, as described
previously.40 Chemicals including CuCl2·2H2O (99%), CuNO3·3H2O (99%), CuSO4·5H2O (99%), Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (99%), and NH3·H2O (17%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Corporation. All other solvents and reagents were obtained
from commercial sources and were used as received.

Synthesis of
Hollow Urchinlike CuO Microspheres
All
CuO microspheres were synthesized by the same procedure in this work.
Typically, 0.25 mmol (0.04275 g) CuCl2·2H2O and 0.5 mmol (0.01648 g) BS-12 were dissolved in 15 ml of water
and stirred for 30 min to form a uniform blue solution. Afterward,
0.5 mL of ammonium hydroxide was added into the solution and stirred
for additional 20 min. Then, the dispersion was transferred into a
Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and sealed, which was maintained
at 130 °C for 12 h. The crude products were isolated by centrifugation
after cooling to room temperature and washed with water and absolute
ethanol for several times. Finally, the products were dried in vacuum
at 50 °C for 24 h.

Characterizations
XRD patterns of
CuO powders were
recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer (Germany) using
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) operated at 40 kV and
40 mA. SEM was carried out on a Zeiss Sigma field-emission SEM. FTIR
spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer in the range
from 4000 to 400 cm–1. TEM and HRTEM were performed
on a JEM-2100 TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The surface
atomic concentration and chemical bonding energy of the sample were
obtained by XPS (K-Alpha, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using microfocused
monochromatized Al Kα radiation. Spectra were collected under
the residual pressure of the analysis chamber, which was 1 ×
10–9 mbar. XPS spectra were corrected with respect
to the C 1s peak (at a binding energy of 284.6 eV) and fitted using
the Gaussian–Lorentzian line shape. The equilibrium surface
tensions were measured by the du Noüy ring method (Krüss
K100, Germany) at 25 °C. UV–vis spectrum measurements
were carried out on a UV–vis Tu-1901 spectrophotometer (Pgeneral,
China) using ultrapure deionized water (Millipore) as a blank at 25
°C.

Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical testing
was performed using coin-type (CR-2016) testing cells, using the CuO
active materials as the working electrode and metallic lithium foil
as the reference and counter electrodes. The CuO working electrodes
were prepared by a slurry coating procedure. The slurry was prepared
by dispersing the active material, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene
fluoride binder with a weight ratio of 80:10:10 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent by stirring overnight. The mass of
each working electrode was precisely measured with an electronic analytical
microbalance. Testing cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox,
where the moisture content and oxygen levels were controlled below
1 ppm (20 °C). The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in a
mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate with a volumetric
ratio of 1:1, and the polypropylene microporous membrane (Celgard
2326) was used as the separator. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted from an electrochemical workstation at
0.02–3.0 V (vs Li+/Li) with a scan rate of 0.2 mV·s–1.
