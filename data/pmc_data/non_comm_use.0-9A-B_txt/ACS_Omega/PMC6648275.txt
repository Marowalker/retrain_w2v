One of the important
discharge mechanisms for lithium batteries
is the conversion reaction mechanism, where a metal oxide (fluoride)
can decompose into metallic nanoparticles embedded in a Li2O (LiF) matrix. Here, 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 is successfully synthesized and displays an electrochemical discharge
capacity of ∼300 mAh/g above 1.5 V (vs Li/Li+).
During the electrochemical cycling process, 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 is decomposed into metallic Bi. During the subsequent
charging process, the metallic bismuth can be first converted into
an amorphous bismuth oxide phase, which contributed to the electrochemical
discharge activities observed between 2 and 2.5 V. At a higher charging
voltage between 3.5 and 5 V, metallic Bi can be oxidized to BiOx2–O3–2x–, which contributes to the discharge
activities observed above 2.5 V. Using graphite as current collectors
can prevent the corrosion from O– species and the
discharge capacity is greatly enhanced at the voltage region between
1.5 and 2.5 V. This work provides a deeper understanding over the
role of oxygen ions during the conversion reaction process and is
beneficial for the future design of battery systems based on the conversion
reaction.

1 Introduction
Lithium
battery has wide applications in portable electronics and
is one of the most attractive power sources for electric vehicles.1−4 Thus, research on new intercalation compounds, which are usually
nanoscale mixed metal oxides, is extensively carried out in the past
few decades.

In a lithium battery, the electrochemical discharge
can also be
based on a conversion reaction, where the metal oxide (or fluoride)
decomposes into metallic nanoparticles embedded in the Li2O (or LiF) matrix.5−9 Since this conversion process is usually accompanied with a larger
electron transfer (such as Fe3+ reduction to Fe with three
electron transfer), a larger discharge capacity can be achieved. As
their typical operational voltages (vs Li/Li+) are less
than 1.5 V, the electrodes, such as CoO, NiO, MnO, Fe2O3, etc.,9−12 are more suitable for anode applications than another series of
electrodes, such as LiFePO4, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, etc.,13−15 where a lithium insertion/extraction
mechanism is typically observed and an operational voltage higher
than 3 V can be achieved. Nevertheless, those electrodes that are
based solely on the lithium extraction/insertion mechanism are limited
by the maximum capacity, which is typically ∼150 mAh/g, much
less than that achieved based on a conversion mechanism.

It
is worth pointing out that, for those oxides, which are based
on the conversion reaction for the electrochemical cycling, oxygen
ions play a significant role in the charge balance, for instance,
the oxidation of the metallic nanoparticle during the charging process
and vice versa. To some extent, the amount of oxygen that a metallic
nanoparticle can reversibly capture and release, determines the discharge
capacity and reversibility of the assembled battery. If the operational
voltages of those electrodes that are based on the conversion reaction
can be increased above 1.5 V, together with a larger discharge capacity,
they can be very attractive for real applications. Surprisingly, for
the intercalation mechanism, the battery operational voltage can be
estimated based on the redox couple that is responsible for charge
transfer,16 whereas for the conversion
mechanism, these electrodes display very similar operational voltage
profiles. Also, the discharge capacity of those electrode materials
that are based on the conversion mechanism can be much more than the
theoretical ones, which are calculated according to electrons transferred
by the complete reduction of metallic ions.7,9 Lithium
hydroxide or polymeric layers formed on the electrode surface might
contribute to the extra discharge capacity.7,9 Nevertheless,
structural investigation on the conversion mechanism is still very
limited and deeper understanding of phase transitions during the electrochemical
cycling is needed.

Bismuth ions, which usually have a valence
state of +3, in some
cases, even have oxidation states of +4 or +5, contributing to a larger
discharge capacity during the electrochemical cycling process,17−19 due to the larger electron transfer when they are reduced to the
metallic state.20−22 Bismuth-based oxides display high oxygen ionic mobility
as well and have some unique discharge activities during the electrochemical
cycling process.23 This unique characteristic
of oxygen mobility, makes bismuth oxides excellent model compounds
for mechanistic investigation due to the significant role of oxygen
during the electrochemical cycling process.

We have previously
studied Ce-doped BiFeO3 using a co-precipitation
route, where Ce doping improved the discharge voltage. In this paper
we use a similar technique to synthesize Li, Fe, and Bi mixed metal
oxide. The pure Bi25FeO40 phase was obtained
using 30% Li doping at 600 °C. Bi25FeO40 is an analogue to γ-Bi2O3, which typically
holds a body centered cubic structure with a space group of I23, where there could have a lot of oxygen and ionic vacancies.24,25 In this paper, we studied 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 as a possible electrode for lithium battery applications and a detailed
discharge mechanism was further investigated using a combination of
in operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption near edge
structure analysis (XANES).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Materials Synthesis and Characterization
Figure 1a displays
the X-ray diffraction patterns of samples synthesized at 600 and 650
°C, using different Li doping levels, compared with the standard
diffraction patterns of BiFeO3 and Bi25FeO40.26,27 At 10% Li doping, the synthesized
sample could be clearly identified with two phases of BiFeO3 and Bi25FeO40, and the BiFeO3 phase
was not completely removed when the synthesis temperature was increased
to 650 °C. At 20% Li doping (600 °C), the synthesized sample
also had two phases of BiFeO3 and Bi25FeO40, whereas the amount of BiFeO3 had been greatly
decreased compared with the sample synthesized using 10% Li doping.
When the Li doping amount increased to 30%, the BiFeO3 phase
could be totally removed at 600 °C.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffraction
patterns of synthesized samples with various
amounts of Li and Fe ratios. Diffraction patterns of standard BiFeO3 (pink) and Bi25FeO40 (orange) were
also displayed for comparison. X-ray wavelength is 1.2398 Å.
(b) Ex situ Fe K-edge XANES spectra of 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 synthesized at 600 °C. (c) Ex situ Bi LIII-edge XANES spectra of 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 synthesized at 600 °C.

A detailed examination of the XRD pattern of 30% Li-doped
sample
(synthesized at 600 °C), revealed a subtle difference when compared
with that of Bi25FeO40, where an extra diffraction
peak appeared at ∼28.5°. A larger cubic unit cell with
a lattice parameter of 20.43 Å was formed after Li doping and
the diffraction peak at ∼28.5° could be assigned to the
(811) diffraction plane. This indicated that a 2 × 2 supper cell
had been formed after Fe ions were partially substituted by Li ions.

Figure 1b displays
the ex situ Fe K-edge XANES spectra of 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 and few standards. The 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 has a similar Fe K-edge position compared to that
of Fe2O3, indicating that the oxidation state
of Fe ions in 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 is +3.

Figure 1c displays
the ex situ Bi LIII-edge XANES spectra of 30% Li-doped
Bi25FeO40 and those of few Bi contained samples
with nominal oxidation states of +3 and +5 were also displayed for
comparison, such as Bi2O3, BiFeO3, CeO2–Bi2Fe4O9 composite, and LiBiO3. The Bi LIII absorption
edge shifted to a higher energy position with an increase of the Bi
ion nominal oxidation states from +3 in Bi2O3, BiFeO3, and CeO2–Bi2Fe4O9 to +5 in LiBiO3. Even within these
four oxides with bismuth ion nominal oxidation states of +3, Bi LIII-edge positions increased in the order of 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40, CeO2–Bi2Fe4O9 composite, BiFeO3, and Bi2O3. This indicated that the oxidation states of the Bi
ions in 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40, CeO2–Bi2Fe4O9 composite, and
BiFeO3 were slightly lower than +3, and that in 30% Li-doped
Bi25FeO40 is the lowest. Since there could be
a lot of oxygen vacancies, which were usually produced with concomitant
reduction of the cationic ions, in both 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 and CeO2–Bi2Fe4O9, it was deduced that it was much easier for
30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 to have more oxygen vacancies
compared with other three compounds, such as the CeO2–Bi2Fe4O9 composite, BiFeO3,
and Bi2O3. Since the Fe ion oxidation states
in 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 were +3, and thus,
Bi ions compensated for charge balance when oxygen vacancies were
produced.

2.2 Galvanostatic Electrochemical Cycling
The 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 electrode prepared
at 50 °C was used as the cathode for lithium battery applications.
Compared with previous systems investigated such as BiFeO3, CeO2–Bi2Fe4O9 composite, Bi2O3, etc., it has an advantage
that the discharge voltage is higher than 2 V. As displayed in Figure 2a, using a discharge
current density of ∼10 mA/g, two discharge plateaus could be
observed at ∼2.5 and ∼3 V, respectively. In the following
three consecutive discharge cycles, the discharge capacity increased
gradually from ∼38.5 to ∼67.3 mAh/g. The first discharge
plateau voltage (∼3 V) also increased gradually from the first
cycle to the fourth one, whereas the second discharge plateau voltage
(∼2.5 V) decreased. The electrochemical discharge capacity
for electrodes prepared at 50 °C was larger than that prepared
at 80 °C, which is displayed in Figure S1a.

Figure 2 Using Al/Cu as the current collector, (a) the galvanostatic cycling
profiles using a current density of ∼10 mA/g. (b) The galvanostatic
cycling profiles using smaller current density. The assembled battery
is first cycled 24 times using a current density of 10 mA/g before
the current density is decreased to 1 mA/g. Using graphite as the
current collector, (c) the galvanostatic cycling profiles using a
current density of ∼10 mA/g. The electrode prepared at 50 °C
was used for battery assembling.

Using a current density of ∼1 mA/g, a larger discharge
capacity
of ∼250 mAh/g can be achieved at the 26th cycle. The observed
capacity corresponds to ∼150 mAh/g above 2.5 V and ∼100
mAh/g between 2 and 2.5 V, as displayed in Figure 2b. When the electrode was prepared at 80
°C, the discharge activity between 2 and 2.5 V (about 40 mAh/g)
was much lower, as observed in Figure S1b. This indicated that the preparation temperature of 50 °C was
suitable for 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 to achieve
a better discharge activity.

Figure 2c displays
the electrochemical cycling performance using graphite as current
collectors in both the anode and cathode sides. Using a current density
of ∼10 mA/g, a discharge capacity of ∼300 mAh/g could
be achieved during the first discharge cycle. The discharge capacity
can still reach ∼200 mAh/g in the fourth one. The electrochemical
charging profiles are quite smooth as well. Using a similar voltage
window, the discharge capacity obtained using Al and Cu current collectors,
are significantly lower, as observed from Figure S1c. Also, if using graphite as the current collector in both
the anode and cathode sides and replacing the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 electrodes with the same graphite, no electrochemical
activity could be observed under the same conditions. This indicates
that graphite is much suitable to be used as current collectors in
the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 battery.

The
electrochemical cycling profiles displayed in Figure 2a,b, especially at a higher
voltage region, are slightly fuzzy. As displayed in later sections,
there are O– species produced during the higher
voltage charging process and the O– species might
influence Al foil used for the current collector at the cathode side.
As a consequence, the electrochemical transport is influenced and
invokes some fuzzy behavior on the charging profile. Using a lower
current density of 1 mA/g, more O– species can be
produced and the electrochemical charging profile at a higher voltage
region is even poor. However, when the current collectors are switched
to graphite, the electrochemical cycling profiles are smooth. Besides
being more resistive to the O– species oxidation,
the graphite might also be beneficial to be used as a storage media
to accommodate more oxidized O– species and facilitate
the charge transfer. Our previous work based on the NaBiO3·2H2O vs Li battery displayed that the electrochemical
discharge capacity can be increased from 0 to 300 mAh/g after putting
NaBiO3·2H2O onto graphene/amorphous porous
carbon hybrid materials.28 The excellent
porous structure of graphite can also be beneficial for the discharge
of the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs Li battery
system.

2.3 Ex Situ XRD Measurements of Cycling Batteries
Few 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs Li batteries
(electrode was prepared at 80 °C) were assembled using the in
situ spectroelectrochemical cell feature and were cycled in a manner
similar to that displayed in Figure S1b using a smaller current density of 0.5 mA/g, where a discharge capacity
of ∼130 mAh/g was achieved. The XRD patterns (Figure 3a) were obtained at various
stages during the electrochemical cycling process. As displayed in
scan 2, when the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs Li
battery is at the end of the 30th discharging cycle with a capacity
of 101 mA/g, the original 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 phase had almost been depleted, compared with Figure S2 (a discharge capacity of ∼35 mAh/g), where
the batteries were cycled using a larger current density of ∼2
mA/g. This indicated that at a smaller current density of 0.5 mA/g,
more 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 participated in
the electrochemical discharge and was converted to metallic Bi, contributing
to a larger discharge capacity. At scan 3, when the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs Li battery is at the end of the 31st
charging cycle with a capacity of 178 mA/g, few extra diffraction
peaks appeared (marked using asterisks) and those diffraction peaks
of metallic Bi disappeared. A conversion mechanism between metallic
Bi and certain bismuth oxide could be observed from Figure 3a. This bismuth oxide phase,
which was marked using asterisks in Figure 3a, was named bismuth oxide I.

Figure 3 (a) Few spectroelectrochemical
batteries were assembled using electrodes
prepared at 80 °C and cycled using a current density of 0.5 mA/g.
At various stages of cycling, the battery was stopped and XRD patterns
were taken. (b) Profile fitting results using a model structure of
BiOx2–F3–2x for the XRD pattern obtained at a discharge capacity
of 47.62 mAh/g. (c) Few spectroelectrochemical batteries were assembled
using electrodes prepared at 50 °C and cycled using a current
density of 1 mA/g. At various stages of cycling, the battery was stopped
and XRD patterns were taken.

However, even after an extensive search of reported bismuth
oxides,
lithiated bismuth oxides and bismuth iron oxides from ICDD-JCPDS PDF-2
powder diffraction database, no compounds display diffraction feature
similar to that of the bismuth oxide I phase. It might be possible
that some O2– ions were oxidized to O– during the charging process, especially at a higher voltage of around
5 V, and a model compound of BiOxF3–2x was used for profile fitting.29 Excellent profile fitting results were obtained
as displayed in Figure 3b, where a mixture of bismuth oxide I and metallic Bi co-existed
after discharging 47.62 mAh/g. This indicated that O2– ions in the electrodes could be oxidized to O– and form BiOx2–O3–2x–. This also
explains why a much better electrochemical discharge capacity can
be obtained by using graphite as the current collector than using
an aluminum foil, which can be easily corroded by O– species. As observed from Figure S2,
the formation of BiOx2–O3–2x– could
be partly reversible as well.

To further investigate the electrochemical
cycling mechanism of
the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs Li battery, ex
situ O K-edge XANES experiments were carried out to directly probe
the electronic configuration changes of oxygen ions.

2.4 Ex Situ O K-Edge XANES Measurements of Cycling
Batteries
Few 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs Li batteries (prepared at 50 °C) were assembled and were
stopped at various stages during the electrochemical cycling process
and ex situ O K-edge XANES spectra were obtained and are displayed
in Figure 4. The O– species can be formed even at the first charging process,
as displayed in Figure 4a, i.e., O2– in 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 can also be gradually oxidized with the increase of the
charging voltage. The emerging peak located at 531.6 eV can be assigned
to O– formed during the charging process.30,31 It is also noticed that the peak A intensity decreased when the
battery is charged to 4.8 V. During the discharge process (Figure 4b), a reverse trend
is observed and the O– species formed during the
charging process decreased gradually. It is also observed that at
the fully discharged stage (discharged@1.5 V), peak A shifted to 534.4
eV, indicating that there are a lot of Li2CO3 formed at this stage30 that could result
in the decrease of electrochemical cycling capacity in the subsequent
electrochemical cycles.

Figure 4 Ex situ O K-edge XANES spectra collected at
various stages during
the electrochemical cycling process of the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40/Li battery (prepared at 50 °C, the current
density of 2 mA/g is used) using the spectroelectrochemical cell feature.
Graphite is used as current collectors for both the anode and cathode
sides. (a) Charging process. (b) Discharging process.

Few batteries were assembled using 30% Li-doped
Bi25FeO40 (the electrode was prepared at 50
°C) and were
cycled in a manner similar to that displayed in Figure 2b, where a much larger discharge capacity
of ∼250 mAh/g could be achieved. The XRD patterns were collected
and are displayed in Figure 3c. When 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 was discharged
to ∼199, 202, and 212 mAh/g, its diffraction patterns displayed
only the metallic Bi phase. This indicated that there was a certain
amorphous bismuth oxide produced during the electrochemical cycling
process, which also participate in the electrochemical discharge.

To further investigate the origin of the discharge capacity, in
situ XRD experiments were performed during the electrochemical cycling
process.

2.5 In Situ XRD Studies of Cycling Batteries
A battery was assembled and discharged in a way similar to that
shown in Figure 2b,
and was first cycled 24 times using a current density of ∼10
mA/g to induce the production of the metallic Bi phase, followed by
a smaller cycling current density of 1 mA/g. During the first part
of the charging process, where the charging voltage is below 3.5 V
and the charging capacity is from 0 to 35.66 mAh/g, the metallic Bi
phase diffraction peak intensity continuously decreased, without any
new phases being observed (Figure 5a), indicating that there were some amorphous bismuth
oxide phases produced during the charging process. This amorphous
bismuth oxide was named bismuth oxide(II).

Figure 5 Series of in situ XRD
patterns collected during the electrochemical
cycling process of the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40/Li battery (prepared at 50 °C, the current density of 5 mA/g
is used) using the spectroelectrochemical cell feature. (a) The charging
process between 0 and 35.66 mAh/g, where zoomed view of 2θ range
between 21.0 and 23.0° is displayed; (b) the continued charging
process between 35.66 and 96.76 mAh/g; (c) the discharging process
at 2.8 V from 0 to 25.26 mAh/g. The X-ray wavelength is 1.2398 Å.

At the following electrochemical
charging process, where the voltage
is above 3.5 V and the charging capacity is from 35.66–96.76
mAh/g, in situ XRD patterns were obtained and are displayed in Figure 5b. As can be observed,
the metallic Bi phase can be converted to the BiOx2–O3–2x– phase during the charging process. In the following
discharge cycle (Figure 5c), where the discharge voltage is at ∼2.8 V, BiOx2–O3–2x– could be converted back to metallic Bi.
This indicated that the conversion reaction between BiOx2–O3–2x– and metallic Bi contributes to higher voltage
activities.

In summary, using a smaller current density of 1
mA/g, metallic
Bi could be first oxidized to an amorphous bismuth oxide(II) phase
at a charging voltage between 2 and 3.5 V. Upon further increasing
the charging voltage between 3.5 and 5 V, metallic Bi can be directly
converted into the BiOx2–O3–2x– phase.
Correlating with Figures 2b and S1b, the discharge activity
observed above 2.5 V was due to the BiOx2–O3–2x– phase and the remaining capacity was due to the amorphous
bismuth oxide(II) phase.

2.6 In Situ XANES Studies of
Cycling Battery
The 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 (prepared at 50°)
vs Li battery, which had been discharged 236.24 mAh/g, was further
used for in situ XANES studies during the charging process, where
the oxidation states of Bi ions were monitored, as displayed in Figure 6. Figure 6 displayed that Bi ion oxidation
states continuously increased during the charging process and at a
charge capacity of ∼120.69 mAh/g, the bismuth ion oxidation
state was very similar to that of Bi2O3. In
the meantime, the white line intensity of Bi LIII-edge
XANES spectra gradually increased during the charging process. This
observation excluded the possibility of transformation from amorphous
bismuth oxide to BiOx2–O3–2x– at a
higher voltage region, since otherwise the oxidation states of the
Bi ions are expected to remain the same and the Bi LIII-edge position would remain unchanged. Thus, metallic Bi is directly
transformed into BiOx2–O3–2x– during
the higher voltage charging process. The XANES experiments displayed
in Figure 6 were very
consistent with the XRD experiments displayed in Figures 3a and 5, where transformation between metallic Bi and BiOx2–O3–2x– was clearly observed during the electrochemical
cycling process.

Figure 6 In situ Bi LIII-edge XANES spectra collected
during
the charging process of the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40/Li battery (prepared at 50 °C, the current density of 5 mA/g
is used) using the spectroelectrochemical cell feature.

Both the in situ XANES spectra and the in situ
XRD patterns further
confirmed the conversion reaction between metallic Bi and the bismuth
oxide phase. The subsequent electrochemical cycling profile for the
in situ XANES studies is displayed in Figure S3, where a discharge capacity of ∼450 mAh/g can be achieved
in the following discharge cycle.

3 Conclusions
30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 was successfully synthesized
and characterized. Synchrotron-based XRD and XANES studies proved
that the conversion reaction between metallic Bi and bismuth oxide
contributed to the electrochemical cycling. In situ XRD experiments
revealed that there was an amorphous bismuth oxide phase formed during
the electrochemical charging process, which contributed to the discharge
capacity located between 2 and 2.5 V. At a higher charging voltage
than 3.5 V, metallic Bi can be transformed into BiOx2–O3–2x–, which contributed to the discharge activity
located at a higher voltage region between 2.5 and 3 V. The usage
of graphite prevents the corrosion from O– species
to the current collector and greatly promotes the electrochemical
discharge, mainly at a lower voltage region between 2 and 2.5 V. The
excellent porous structure of graphite can be also beneficial for
the discharge of the 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs
Li battery system.

4 Methodology
4.1 Synchrotron-Based XRD Measurements
The XRD patterns
were collected at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility.32−35 The X-ray wavelength used was 1.2398 Å unless
specified. The ex situ measurements were carried out using a flat-plate
reflection (Bragg–Brentano) mode. The in situ XRD studies were
performed using a flat-plate transmission geometry. A MX225 detector
was used for data acquisition and a Fit2d code was further used for
diffraction ring intensity integration. NIST LaB6 standard
was used to calibrate the sample to detector distance. In situ X-ray
diffraction studies were performed using a spectroelectrochemical
cell feature.36−38 Typical acquisition time during in situ measurement
was 1.5 min for one scan. During some in situ experiments, a Mythen1K
linear detector was employed with an acquisition time of ∼7
min/scan.33 The electrochemical current
densities used for in situ studies were ∼5 mA/g. Few spectroelectrochemical
batteries were assembled and X-ray diffraction patterns were collected
at various stages during the electrochemical cycling process as well.

4.2 Synchrotron-Based XANES Measurements
The
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy studies
for Bi LIII-edge were carried out at the BL14W1 beamline
of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in the transmission
mode.39 The acquisition time for a typical
XANES scan was ∼14 min. A lead foil was used for Bi LIII-edge energy calibration. Gas used for I0 chamber was 88% N2/12% Ar and that used for It chamber was 100% Ar. In situ XANES studies were performed
using a spectroelectrochemical cell feature as well.36−38 The O K-edge XANES spectra were measured at BL08U1A using the total
electron yield mode.40 Before measurements,
few 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 vs Li batteries were
assembled and cycled at a current density of 2 mA/g, where graphite
was used as the current collector in both the anode and cathode sides.
At various charging stages, the batteries were stopped and dissembled
in the glovebox. The 30% Li-doped Bi25FeO40 electrodes
were washed thoroughly using the electrolyte and dried in a glovebox
for 10 min before they were quickly transferred to the XANES chamber
for measurements.

4.3 Materials Synthesis
30% Li-doped
Bi25FeO40 was synthesized using a co-precipitation
route.21,23 Typically, stoichiometric amount of LiNO3, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, and
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved
thoroughly in deionized water under vigorous stirring. Few drops of
diluted nitric acid were also added into the solution for better dissolution.
NH3·H2O was added dropwise into the solution
to adjust the pH to ∼10, and all the cationic ions were fully
deposited out. The resulting slurry was heated until all liquids were
evaporated. The obtained precursor was further heat-treated in a muffing
furnace. The other two compositions using 10 and 20% LiNO3 additions followed the same procedures for synthesis.

4.4 Electrochemical Galvanostatic Cycling
The synthesized
compounds were further mixed with poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) and acetylene black in weight percentages of 0.75,
0.125, and 0.125. Few drops of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP) were added into the thoroughly mixed mixture to form a uniform
slurry. The slurry was manually painted onto a 3 cm × 3 cm thin
Al foil (thickness of 15 μm). The painted Al foil was transferred
to a vacuum oven at 50, 80, and 120 °C overnight. Finally, they
were vacuumed for 10 min. These electrode materials after drying can
be naturally detached from the Al foil and were used for battery assembling.
The battery was assembled using a spectroelectrochemical cell feature
with Li metal as the anode.36−38 Typical cycling current densities
were ∼1 and 10 mA/g. The electrochemical galvanostatic cycling
was performed using a Neware battery cycler. Two kinds of current
collectors, such as Al foil and graphite foil, were used for the current
collectors in the cathode side.

4.5 Data
Analysis
The X-ray diffraction
patterns were analyzed using the CMPR/LOGIC program.41 A standard ICDD-JCPDS PDF-2 powder diffraction database
was also installed for comparison. The extended X-ray absorption fine
structure data were analyzed using the ATHENA module of the IFEFFIT
program for E0 selection, background subtraction,
normalization, etc.42 The crystal structure
of BiOxF3–2x was searched from Inorganic Crystal Structure Database.29 Profile fitting was performed using an EXPGUI
code.43
