Reduced
graphene oxide (RGO)-supported bimetallic PdxAgy alloy nanoparticles of various
compositions were synthesized by one-pot coreduction of respective
precursors with hydrazine for use in the anode catalysis of oxidation
of butan-1-ol in alkali. The as-synthesized catalyst materials were
characterized by microscopic, spectroscopic, and diffraction techniques.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry, and polarization studies
infer that a few PdxAgy materials exhibit an enhanced and synergistic catalytic activity
in reference to Pd and Ag nanomaterials. Among the various RGO composites
of PdxAgy alloy
on graphite support, the one containing the Pd70Ag30@RGO composite is the best in catalytic activity. The cycle
life of the catalyst is found to be very high, and PdO and Ag2O are found to be generated in the catalyst material with
little change in the catalytic capability during the 100th cycle of
CV operation. The addition of Ag upto 30 atom % in the PdxAgy alloy causes greater
formation of butyraldehyde and butyl butanoate among the various products.
Larger atom % of Pd helps to form sodium butyrate and sodium carbonate,
as evident from the ex situ Fourier transform infrared and high-performance
liquid chromatography study of the product mixtures and the separate
CV studies of the intermediate products. A suitable mechanism is also
proposed to fit the findings.

Introduction
In the era of rapidly
depleting fossil fuel and ever-rising demand for renewable and sustainable
energy, the urge for environment-safe fuel source and its proper utilization
has become an immediate concern for the modern society.1 Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) appear as potential
alternative green and renewable power devices, as these use liquid
fuels, which are harmless, easy to handle, and easy to store as well
as affable to the ecosystem.2,3 In addition, these devices
possess higher volumetric energy densities than the gaseous hydrogen
counterparts, thereby becoming more popular as highly efficient, low-emissive,
and soundless power sources for cars and portable electronic devices.4

Various alcohols such as methanol, ethanol,
propanol-isomers, ethane-1,2-diol, and propane-1,2,3-triol have been
widely investigated as potential fuels for DAFCs.5−10 The reactivity of small primary alcohols on the Pt electrode surface
in acid has been found to follow the order methanol > ethanol >
propanol > n-butanol.5,11 However,
the poor alcohol cross-over across the membrane and the complex reaction
mechanism lower the cell performance, and these are the major hurdles
in the alcohol oxidation process in most cases.12 Nonetheless, recent studies reveal that the alcohol cross-over
rate is comprehensively reduced on increasing the alcohol chain length.12 Moreover, a single alcohol molecule bears one
oxygen atom only; thus, the full oxidation of alcohol to carbon dioxide
requires additional O atom, which is provided by water or water-adsorbed
residue (OHads) on the metal-catalyst surface. Again, the
oxidation of water on the metal surface is an energy-seeking process
that upraises the anodic over potential of DAFCs. Thus, the present
objective lies in full oxidation of the alcohol molecule at a lower
anodic potential to attain high fuel cell efficiency.5,13−15

Various other important factors such as easy
availability, accessibility, price, environmentally benign, and sustainability
are important criteria for selecting a suitable fuel for DAFCs.16 A thorough knowledge about the kind of intermediates,
the effective cell voltage, and the amount of deliverable charge per
fuel molecule is necessary for the fruitful fabrication of a fuel
cell.17 Methanol is comparatively easier
to oxidize, but toxicity, inflammability, and nonavailability of the
renewable source restrict its usage in practical DAFCs.18 In contrast, ethanol is nontoxic and easily
processable from sugar fermentations.19−22 However, the utilization of edible
food-based biomass feed stock for generation of large-scale bioethanol
has been a sensitive issue of significant debate in the recent days.23,24 In this regard, butanol may be considered as a suitable alternative
with higher energy density and better infrastructure compatibility.
Currently, it is employed as a gasoline additive as well.24−26 Furthermore, it is less poisonous, noncorrosive, and biodegradable
and causes less soil and water pollution.27 Works based on butanol oxidation reaction (BOR), unlike that of
methanol and ethanol, have been much less explored. The oxidation
of butanol isomers on various electrodes (Pt, Au, Pd, and Rh polycrystalline
electrodes) in alkaline media was studied in the recent past.9,28,29

Research reveals that the
Pd catalyst has been considered as an excellent material for the construction
of the anode for application of DAFCs in alkaline media.30,31 First, palladium exhibits better electrocatalytic activity and poison
tolerance than platinum for alkaline oxidation of alcohols. Second,
Pd is relatively more copious compared to Pt, which makes it more
cost effective. However, Pd-based electrocatalysts need additional
enhancement in catalytic performance and stability to accomplish commercialization
of DAFCs.32

Bimetallic catalysts
generally exhibit superior activity over monometallic catalysts for
alcohol oxidation reactions because of the bifunctional mechanism
and/or ligand effect.33 Significant efforts
have been made to improve the performance of Pd catalysts by combining
with one or more elements, such as Au, Ag, Ni, Cu, Sn, Pb, and so
forth, to improve the capability of Pd for alkaline alcohol electro-oxidation.26,33−36 Open-structural effects along with excellent surface accessibility
with the optimal use of precious metals are also obtained by this
technology.

A variety of approaches associated with the preparation
of bimetallic catalysts, including thermal decomposition, galvanic
replacements, solvothermal technique, radiolysis, electrochemical
deposition, and so forth, are available in the literature.37−39 Current research stresses on the green synthesis of alloy nanoparticles
and avoids toxicity of the precursor chemicals. Our group also obtained
interesting results on alcohol oxidation in alkaline medium involving
green method of preparation of Pd–Ag bimetal catalysts.40

In the recent past, various forms of nanoporous
carbons such as active carbon, carbon nanocoils, carbon nano-onions,
carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and especially graphene
have been widely employed to reduce the agglomeration effect of nanoparticles
besides improving their electrical conductivity, which ultimately
pertains to enhancement of the overall performance of the system.41−43 Chemical doping is essentially carried out to modify the surface
structure and physicochemical property of graphene.43,44 Incorporation of electron-rich oxygen atoms into graphene as in
reduced graphene oxide (RGO) improves the dispersion state of the
metal nanoparticles on the graphene surface and also modifies the
surface structure of the carbon material.44,45 RGO composites with metal nanoparticles have received significant
attention in recent years because of their unique electronic, physical,
mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties.45,46

Lately, bimetallic carbon (Pd–Ag/C) systems have exhibited
excellent fuel cell efficiency with enhanced CO tolerance and better
stability compared to Pt–C and Pd–C composites.47 Even activated CNT-supported Pd–Ag (1:1)
catalyst showed larger electroactive surface area and better catalytic
efficiency for methanol oxidation in alkaline media.48 Bimetallic Pd–Ag catalysts prepared by the impregnation–reduction
method exhibited improved catalytic activities for ethanol oxidation
reaction, a very important reaction for fuel cells.49 Even one-pot synthesis of electrocatalysts, Pd–Ag
nanoparticles decorated on RGO (synthesized using ionic liquid-assisted
electrochemical exfoliation of graphite), was reported for the alkaline
ethanol oxidation process.50 Graphene-bimetallic
composite systems are, thus, promising candidates for application
in DAFCs.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
report on the comparison of the activity of BOR on bimetallic catalysts
of various compositions anchored onto RGO support. In the present
work, we have synthesized separate samples of Pd, Ag, and PdxAgy alloy nanoparticles
on the RGO matrix by coreduction of the respective metal precursor
and GO with hydrazine at 60 °C. The drop-casted as-synthesized
materials on graphite electrodes are used as anode catalysts for butanol
oxidation in alkali. The synergetic effect of RGO and bimetallic nanosystem
on the electro-oxidation of butan-1-ol has been studied in detail
and is presented here. The plausible mechanism of butanol oxidation
on these electrocatalysts has also been explored. Ex situ Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) and high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) studies of the products of BOR were carried out to understand
the role of individual components in the various stages of electrocatalysis.
The exploration focuses on shaping the optimum binary composition
of the Pd–Ag alloy system anchored onto the RGO surface to
get the best electrocatalytic activity in reference to the butan-1-ol
oxidation in alkaline media.

Results and Discussion
X-ray Diffraction Study
Figure 1 shows the
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of GO and synthesized composites:
Pd@RGO, Pd90Ag10@RGO, Pd80Ag20@RGO, Pd70Ag30@RGO, Pd50Ag50@RGO, Pd30Ag70@RGO, and Ag@RGO.
In Figure 1a, the formation
of GO has been indicated by the diffraction peak on the 2θ scale
at ∼10.38° representing its (002) planes. The peak around
42.5° corresponds to the hexagonal structure of carbon, well
in agreement with the literature.41

Figure 1 PXRD patterns
for (a) GO and (b) all synthesized nanocomposite materials.

The crystalline structure of the
Ag@RGO, Pd@RGO, and PdxAgy@RGO nanocomposites prepared by using equivalent
experimental condition has been depicted by PXRD studies presented
in Figure 1b. Pristine
Pd and Ag samples show peaks at 40.1 (111), 46.7 (200), 68.1 (220),
82.1 (311), and 86.6 (222) and at 38.2 (111), 44.4 (200), 64.6 (220),
77.6 (311), and 81.7 (222) as found from the JCPDS files numbered
894897 and 870720, respectively. Every profile consists of at least
four prominent diffraction peaks, which can be indexed as (111), (200),
(220), and (311) planes of face-centered cubic structure of metallic
Ag@RGO, Pd@RGO, and PdxAgy@RGO nanocomposites.

The presence of relatively
intense peak for Pd(111) in the composites clearly indicates that
this surface would play a crucial role in the alkali-mediated alcohol
oxidation process, as observed from the density functional theory
calculation reported in the literature.51 Additionally, the diffraction peaks of the bimetallic particles
show characteristic shift in positions with respect to pure Ag@RGO
and Pd@RGO. This observation signifies that PdxAgy@RGO nanocomposites are constituted
of bimetallic single phase of PdxAgy alloy nanoparticles rather than two monometallic
single phases of Pd and Ag nanoparticles. Moreover, the peak at ∼10°
observed for GO is permanently absent; the development of a broad
hump around 25° indicates instead its reduction to RGO phase
(Figure S-1). Thus, the above analyses
suggest that the PdxAgy@RGO composite is composed of PdxAgy nanoalloy anchored onto the RGO surface.

Detailed PXRD pattern analyses were carried out to obtain the values
of crystallite size, lattice parameters, and mutual binary composition
of Pd and Ag in PdxAgy@RGO alloy nanoparticles following our previous studies52,53 and are presented in Table 1. The atom % of Ag in the binary PdxAg100–x alloy evaluated
from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study is found to be very close to
that obtained from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
study. The slight difference between the two data might be due to
incomplete alloy formation or statistical difficulties in the measurements.
The mean size of the nanoparticles was designed from the peak width
at half-maximum corresponding to (111) plane by the Debye Scherrer
equation. It is observed that the Pd70Ag30@RGO
composite has the smallest crystallite size among all samples. According
to the d-band center theory, the smaller lattice constant of Pd (3.89
Å), compared to Ag (4.09 Å), causes a tensile strain in
the structure of the palladium surface on alloying Pd with Ag. This
modifies the d-band center of Pd, leading to stronger adsorption ability
of the hydroxyl groups, and facilitates the electro-oxidation reaction
of alcohol on the metal surface.54−56 Thus, the synergistic
interaction between Ag and Pd on the RGO support in the composite
is expected to exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

Morphology
Study
Figure 2 represents the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
images of graphene-supported, synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles,
namely (a) Pd70Ag30@RGO, (b) Pd50Ag50@RGO, (c) Pd30Ag70@RGO, and
(d) Pd@RGO, respectively. On increasing the content of Ag, agglomeration
of nanoparticles as well as RGO sheets is observed in the composites.

Figure 2 FESEM
images of (a) Pd70Ag30@RGO, (b) Pd50Ag50@RGO, (c) Pd30Ag70@RGO, and
(d) Pd@RGO samples.

The images reveal that
Pd70Ag30@RGO (Figure 2a) contains thin layers of RGO with a uniform
distribution of nanoparticles throughout the sheet as compared to
Pd30Ag70@RGO (Figure 2c) and Pd50Ag50@RGO
(Figure 2b).

Figure 3 explains
the EDX spectrum with elemental composition of a part of the Pd70Ag30@RGO electrode surface. The elemental distribution
of Ag and Pd in the Pd70Ag30@RGO nanocomposite
was calculated through compositional line profiles and EDX mapping
analysis.

Figure 3 EDX mapping images of the Pd70Ag30@RGO composite.

The elemental mapping indicates
that both Ag and Pd are homogeneously scattered throughout the Pd70Ag30@RGO nanocomposite, further approving the
possibility of alloy formation in the system.

Formation of alloy
is important because it can provide the basis for higher performance
of the electrocatalytic process.57

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph presented in Figure 4a shows that the
nanoalloy particles in the Pd70Ag30@RGO sample
are uniformly distributed over the crumpled sheets of few-layered
RGO. The average diameter of the particles as obtained from the histogram
presented in the inset of the figure is found to be 11.6 nm, which
is approximately double the average size of the crystallites, as obtained
from XRD studies, because of agglomeration. The high-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) image of the nanocomposite shows a lattice fringe spacing
of 2.2 Å (Figure 4b), which closely matches with the d-spacing of
the Pd–Ag nanoalloy composite observed from the XRD data.

and HRTEM (b) images of the Pd70Ag30@RGO sample.
Inset of (a) represents the histograms of particle size distribution.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is extensively utilized to analyze the carbon
composite materials and can afford useful information regarding the
extent of disorder, defect density, structural defect, and degree
of doping levels. Figure 5 shows the Raman spectra of GO, Pd70Ag30@RGO, Pd30Ag70@RGO, and Pd@RGO. Generally,
Raman spectrum of graphene is considered to have two main features,
the G band (usually observed at ∼1575 cm−1) arising from the planar vibration of sp2-bonded carbon
atoms and the D band (positioned around 1350 cm−1) from the vibrations of sp3-bonded carbon atoms. The
latter is related to special shaped edges, stacking disorder between
two layers, and atomic defects within the layer of disordered graphene.
The relative intensity ratio of D band (ID) to G band (IG) provides the in-plane
crystallite size or the amount of disorder in the sample. All four
samples exhibited the characteristic D and G bands with a slight shift
in the peak positions, which are attributed to the change in electronic
states in graphene owing to strong anchoring of Pd–Ag nanoparticles.
The ID/IG ratio
is found to be the highest in Pd70Ag30@RGO (1.13)
followed by Pd30Ag70@RGO (1.11), Pd@RGO (1.06),
and GO (0.996) in the order, revealing a substantial reduction of
sp3-bonded carbon atoms in the composites compared to GO.
Thus, the composite with more defect-free phases would accelerate
faster electron transfer for electrocatalytic reactions.

Figure 5 Raman spectra
of GO, Pd70Ag30@RGO, Pd30Ag70@RGO, and Pd@RGO.

Moreover, increase in
the relative intensity ratio also signifies substantial chemical interaction
between anchored metal nanoparticles and surface vacancies and defects
on graphene sheets resulted from the chemical reduction of GO.58,59 These features are vital for reducing the rate of agglomeration
of metal nanoparticles and improving the electrocatalytic properties
of the composite.

FTIR Analysis
FTIR (Figure 6) was carried out to study
the chemical association of Pd–Ag with the RGO surface, supplementing
the above-discussed Raman analysis.

Figure 6 FTIR spectra of GO, Pd@RGO, Ag@RGO, and
PdxAgy@RGO
samples.

FTIR spectrum of the GO sample
shows typical broad, extended, and intense stretching of the hydroxyl
group at 3301 cm–1, and the associated red shift
in the position of absorption peak is due to the involvement of O–H
bonds in hydrogen bonding. In addition, peaks related to C=O
carbonyl stretching observed at 1726 cm−1, the
aromatic C=C in conjugation with C=O group stretching
at 1581 cm−1, the C−O epoxy stretching at
1400 cm−1 and C−O alkoxy stretching frequencies
at 1210 and 1031 cm−1, are well in accordance 
with previous reports.60

In the spectrum
of Pd@RGO and Ag@RGO, there is a decrease in relative peak intensities
as well as a bathochromic shift in the positions of carboxyl, epoxy,
and hydroxyl peaks. In PdxAgy@RGO, further loading of metal nanoparticles dramatically
modified the aforesaid peaks with the increasing removal of oxygen-containing
functionalities from the surface of RGO. The study indicates the anchoring
of the metal nanoalloy particles to RGO sheets vide these oxygen functionalities,
thereby confirming the formation of the true composite in the above
systems.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Figure 7 illustrates the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) profile of GO (black line), Pd@RGO (red line), and Pd70Ag30@RGO (blue line) samples, respectively. TGA profile
of GO (black line) shows initial weight loss around 120 °C because
of the presence of physically adsorbed water in the sample. Second
degradation of GO occurs (upto 5%) at around 200 °C because of
loss of oxygen-containing groups, while the third step degradation
∼500 °C is due to gradual loss of the carbon skeleton.
For the Pd@RGO sample (red line), on account of Pd anchoring onto
the RGO surface, initial weight loss due to physically adsorbed water
and loss of oxygen-containing groups are considerably checked. This
indicates that Pd preferentially is anchored to the oxygen functional
groups onto the RGO surface. In the Pd70Ag30@RGO nanocomposite sample, because of further increase in the metal
content compared to Pd@RGO, initial loss due to physically adsorbed
water as well as loss of oxygen containing groups are further restricted.
However, high exfoliation of the RGO sheets in this case renders lower
decomposition temperature compared to Pd@RGO. So, the above studies
confer the formation of a true composite with reasonably higher thermal
stability that may be useful for higher temperature electrocatalytic
applications.

Pd@RGO, and (c) Pd70Ag30@RGO composites.

Electrochemical Studies
Figure 8a represents
the cyclic voltammograms of Pd@RGO, Ag@RGO, and the different PdxAgy@RGO electrodes
immersed in N2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution. The cyclic
voltammetry (CV) profile for RGO (as presented in the upper inset
of Figure 8a) indicates
change in the capacitance current density with potential because of
adsorption and desorption of ions on the RGO sheets. It shows no characteristic
peak for any redox reaction, indicating that RGO does not contain
any potential redox group in the potential range studied. The CV profile
for Ag@RGO electrode shows almost similar behavior to our earlier
study of Ag electrodes with peak potentials at ca. 0.296 and 0.380
V for the formation of AgOH and Ag2O, respectively.40 Two peaks developed at around 0.03 and 0.35
V in the cyclic voltammogram for the Pd@RGO electrode are attributed
to OH– ion adsorption on the Pd surface as designated
by s-PdOH and formation of oxide, s-PdO, following equations described
in the previous study.57,61 Because the peak potential of
formation of PdO is slightly greater than the peak potential of AgOH
formation, the two peaks sometimes often merge to a single broad peak,
as observed in PdxAgy@RGO electrodes. Because the peak current density for formation
of s-PdOH on different electrodes follows the order Pd30Ag70@RGO > Pd80Ag20@RGO >
Pd70Ag30@RGO > Pd50Ag50@RGO > Pd@RGO > Pd90Ag10@RGO, it indicates
that the product s-PdOH undergoes transmetallation reaction as 1  

Figure 8 (a) Cyclic
voltammograms of different PdxAgy@RGO electrodes immersed in 0.1 M NaOH solution.
The upper and lower insets of the figure represent CV curves of GO
and Ag@RGO. CV curve of different electrodes of various compositions
immersed in 0.1 M butanol in 0.1 M NaOH when the current scale is
presented in (b) mA cm–2 and (c) in mA/mg. The inset
of (c) depicts the CV curve of Ag@RGO taken in the same solution.

Moreover, the peak current densities
for the formation of PdO and Ag2O on some PdxAgy@RGO electrodes are
greater than those on Ag@RGO electrode, indicating different transmetallation
reactions according to the equations 2   3  as described earlier for PdxAgy electrodes.40 Thus, AgOH and Ag2O may act as storer and supplier
of oxygen to Pd.

The CV profiles (Figure 8a) for different PdxAgy@RGO electrodes resemble the
pure PdxAgy electrodes immersed in the same solution without RGO in certain
features like peaks for electro-oxidation of Pd and Ag on the electrode
surface.40

Peak for Nafion-covered
reduced graphite oxide electrode was not found, indicating that the
supporting material graphite oxide and Nafion are inactive in the
potential range in alkali. During the forward sweep around 0.1 V,
a peak arises due to the adsorption of OH– ion by
Pd nanoparticle electrodes and formation of PdO following the equation 4   5  

After that, a shoulder and a peak are generated because of
the formation of AgOH and Ag2O, following the reactions 6   7  

The peak current densities
for the reactions 6 and 7 increase in the order of catalyst: Pd30Ag70@RGO > Pd70Ag30@RGO > Pd50Ag50@RGO > Pd80Ag20@RGO >
Pd90Ag10@RGO for increase of Ag content in the
alloys.

In the reverse scan, the first cathodic peak appears
at ca. 0.05 V because of the reaction 7 occurring
in the backward direction. The next reverse peak is attributed to
the formation of Pd from Pd–O following the equations corresponding
to eqs 4 and 5. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) per unit
mass is obtained by dividing the loading in mg cm–2 to the charge required per unit area to reduce monolayer of PdO
divided by the value of 0.405. micro cm–2.52 The ECSA is found to follow the order Pd30Ag70@RGO > Pd50Ag50@RGO
> Pd70Ag30@RGO > Pd80Ag20@RGO > Pd@RGO > Pd90Ag10@RGO,
indicating that the electrodes containing a low Pd % have higher ECSA
measured in cm2 per mg of Pd. Thus, it reveals the strong
interconversion between AgOH and PdOH during the reduction of PdOH/PdO.

CV Study of Butan-1-ol Oxidation in Alkali
Figure 8b compares the steady CVs of
different PdxAgy@RGO electrodes for the oxidation of butanol in the potential
range of −0.9 to +0.6 V at a scan rate of 0.05 V s–1. A large peak for butan-1-ol oxidation appears in the potential
range of −0.053 to −0.166 V during the anodic scan.
The oxidation peak in the reverse (IB)
scan is due to the removal of carbonaceous species that are not entirely
oxidized on the forward scan and also due to oxidation of butanol
by fresh adsorption. The peak potentials and peak current densities
are listed in Table 2.

Ag@RGO	0.170	0.398	1.27	0.685	0.071	–0.8	–0.510	
The mass normalized peak current
densities (IF and IB) illustrate that Pd70Ag30@RGO is the
best catalyst among the electrodes studied. The enhanced electrocatalytic
activity of Pd70Ag30@RGO toward butan-1-ol oxidation
in alkali can be attributed to the presence of Ag in the alloy that
can accelerate the oxidation of reaction intermediates by the formation
of Ag2O and AgOH, which can serve as a storing material
of Pd(OH)x. Thus, the combination with
Ag reduces the poisoning of active Pd sites more effectively.

The EF values follow the order Pd80Ag20@RGO > Pd70Ag30@RGO
> Pd50Ag50@RGO > Pd30Ag70@RGO > Pd90Ag10@RGO, indicating
the greater extent of oxidation of carbonaceous species relative to
hydrogen in the oxidation of butan-1-ol on the electrodes.62 Notably, EB values
follow exactly the reverse order indicating the improvement of Pd2+ in the oxidation of butanol and hence its delayed reduction
as follows: Pd70Ag30@RGO > Pd50Ag50@RGO > Pd90Ag10@RGO >
Pd80Ag20@RGO > Pd30Ag70@RGO in mA cm–2 and the order Pd70Ag30@RGO > Pd50Ag50@RGO > Pd30Ag70@RGO > Pd90Ag10@RGO
> Pd80Ag20@RGO in mA mg–1 of Pd.

Chronoamperometric Study
To assess the constancy in
catalytic activity and long-term stability of different PdxAgy@RGO electrodes in
a working butan-1-ol fuel cell, chronoamperometric (CA) measurements
were carried out at a potential of −0.3 V for 600 s in a solution
of 0.1 (M) 1-butanol in 0.1 (M) NaOH, as presented in Figure 9. All catalysts reveal typical
profiles of decreased current density with time for alcohol oxidation.
The initial high current density arises because of double-layer charging,
and then the current density gets decreased for blocking of active
sites on the catalyst surface because of the formation of intermediate
carbonaceous species, such as CO-like species. However, all catalysts
show a consistent steady current density after 600 s, indicating their
possible application as a long-term constant power source. Among all
catalysts, Pd70Ag30@RGO shows the maximum current
density, indicating its superiority over other similarly synthesized
catalysts.

in 0.1 M NaOH.

Polarization Study
Figure 10 illustrates
the Tafel plot of potential (E) versus logarithm
of current (log i) for different alloy electrodes
studied. The Pd90Ag10@RGO electrode shows the
Tafel region at the lower potential and others at relatively higher
potential region, indicating the influence of catalyst composition
on the degree of completion of the reaction (on addition of Ag). Both
the Tafel slope and i0 are relatively
high for Pd70Ag30@RGO in comparison to the others
(Table 3).

Increase of the Tafel slope indicates less value of
transmission coefficient for the conversion of butanol to carbonate.
This might be due to less availability of catalyst sites for conversion
of butanol to butyraldehyde for slow (and less) conversion of the
latter upto the end product, carbonate anion. Greater i0 means greater current density at the equilibrium potential
for the abovementioned reaction. Thus, the best current-delivering
electrode, Pd70Ag30@RGO, increases its current-delivering
capability by the formation of more intermediate products rather than
progressing toward the end product, carbonate anion. Moreover, both
the slope and i0 are extremely low for
the Pd30Ag70@RGO electrode because the progress
of the reaction upto the end product is slow and time-consuming. For
the electrodes having intermediate composition, Tafel slopes and poisoning
are also intermediate.

Evidences in Support of the Plausible Mechanism
of Butan-1-ol Oxidation for Pd70Ag30@RGO Catalyst
in 0.1 M NaOH Solution
CV Study of Sodium Butyrate and Butyraldehyde
The CV profiles in Figure 11 indicate that the peak currents for the oxidation of Ag metal
and Ag2O and Pd reduction decrease with increase in the
concentration of sodium butyrate or butyraldehyde. This suggests that
these added compounds get adsorbed on the metal surface, preventing
the metal to get oxidized. Moreover, these compounds do not react
at the potential range studied. So, this study indicates that sodium
butyrate and butyraldehyde do not get oxidized by the electrode at
the potential range studied.

each at concentrations of 6, 12, 36, and 100 mM in 0.1 M NaOH solution
at the scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

Cycle Study of the Electrocatalysis of Butanol Oxidation on
the Pd70Ag30@RGO Catalyst
Initially,
in the course of oxidation of butanol, Ag adsorbed the fuel to form
C4H9OAg on the surface of Ag. On repetition
of the CV operation, the Ag nanoparticle gets oxidized to form Ag2O or AgOH, which helps as a secondary catalyst of butan-1-ol
oxidation on the Pd–Ag alloy surface. Thus, the peak current
density for butanol oxidation increases even after 70 cycles and the
peak for Ag to Ag2O decreases as observed from the CV profile
in Figure 12a.

for butan-1-ol oxidation increases at various cycles for Pd70Ag30@RGO catalyst in 0.1 M NaOH solution at the scan rate
of 0.05 V/s. (b) XRD profiles of Pd70Ag30@RGO
catalyst after 100 cycles of voltammetric operation.

XRD Pattern Study of the Catalyst after 100
Catalytic Cycles
To observe the fate of Pd70Ag30@RGO catalyst over the planar carbon surface after the 100th
cycle of multiscan CV operation, XRD of the film (Figure 12b) is carried out. It is seen
that the resultant diffractogram contains several spikes because of
the presence of amorphous carbon particles; but peaks (2θ/degree)
for RGO (26.64°), Pd70Ag30@RGO (39.74°),
and hexagonal carbon (42.97°), which were present before any
CV operation are also vivid here.

The 2θ/degree of Pd70Ag30@RGO is slightly decreased, indicating increased
interplanar spacing and cell parameter, plausibly due to inclusion
of the oxygen atom within the layers of crystallites. Moreover, new
peaks for PdO (51.25°) and Ag2O (61.61°) have
generated providing oxidation of the two metals Pd and Ag to a measurable
extent, which influence the BOR by being oxygen sources.

FTIR Study
Figure 13 shows
the FTIR spectra of Pd50Ag50@RGO, Pd70Ag30@RGO, and Pd@RGO electrocatalysts after 100 cycles
of BOR in alkali. The spectra in each case are very complex showing
the presence of numerous peaks that are assigned to adsorption of
butanol (reactant) and butaldehyde/butyrate (products) onto the catalyst
surface.

Figure 13 FTIR spectra of (a) Pd50Ag50@RGO, (b) Pd70Ag30@RGO, and (c) Pd@RGO respectively.

However, one noticeable change is observed for
the C=O stretching frequencies in each case. Literature reports
reveal that generally aldehyde C=O stretching is observed around
1730 cm–1, whereas the carboxylate ions show red-shifted
C=O stretching around ∼1700 cm–1.
The Pd@RGO catalyst shows (Table 4) carbonyl stretching at 1719 cm–1 indicating the merging of the presence of aldehyde and butyrate
almost in equal proportions.

However, for Pd50Ag50@RGO and
Pd70Ag30@RGO, two distinct peaks for aldehyde
and butyrate, respectively, are observed.

The relative peak
intensity of aldehyde is less than the butyrate for the Pd70Ag30@RGO catalyst. It is apparent from the above observation
that Pd70Ag30@RGO accelerates the formation
of butyrate. To have detailed information on the relative proportions
of the products and reactants, HPLC of the resultant electrolyte solution
after 100 cycles has been executed.

HPLC Study of the Product
Solution
HPLC study reveals the formation of at least four
compounds, as evident from the four intense peaks depicted in Figure 14 for the solutions
after BOR on Pd@RGO, Pd50Ag50@RGO, and Pd70Ag30@RGO electrodes. The compounds produced are
sodium butyrate, butyraldehyde, sodium carbonate, and butyl butyrate.
HPLC profiles of the first three compounds are also presented here
for understanding their peak positions.

Figure 14 HPLC study of the product
solutions of butan-1-ol on Pd@RGO, Pd50Ag50@RGO,
and Pd70Ag30@RGO electrodes.

It is observed that the retention time (min) of
sodium carbonate (6.59) is in between that of butyraldehyde (5.99)
and sodium butyrate (7.40). For this reason, although the peak for
butyrate in different product solutions is separated and vivid, the
peaks for carbonate and butyraldehyde merge together into a single
broad peak with or without two humps.

It is evident from the
peak heights (or peak area) that butyl butyrate (3.02) is produced
in the order Pd70Ag30@RGO (4182) > Pd50Ag50@RGO (4032) > Pd@RGO (419), whereas butyraldehyde
is produced in the order Pd@RGO (6363) > Pd50Ag50@RGO (5839) > Pd70Ag30@RGO (5693).

As butyl butyrate is expected to form from a chemical reaction
between the produced butyraldehyde and the existing butyl alcohol,
its formation can be considered to be equivalent to the formation
of butyraldehyde. Thus, it can be told that the initial formation
of butyraldehyde is facilitated in the order of catalysts: Pd70Ag30@RGO > Pd50Ag50@RGO
> Pd@RGO. However, the amount of formation of butyrate and carbonate
in the studied electrodes follows the order Pd@RGO > Pd70Ag30@RGO > Pd50Ag50@RGO. It indicates
that the subsequent formation of butyrate and carbonate decreases
on increasing the mol % of Ag in the composite. Thus, Ag at its optimum
composition assists the formation of butyraldehyde but obstructs (prohibits)
the formation of butyrate and carbonate at all compositions. This
type of conclusion is also obtained in our previous study.40

Mechanism
The
CV profile of anodic oxidation of butanol is similar in nature to
that of other small alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. Thus, the
expected dissociative adsorption of butanol occurs mainly through
the C atom rather than the O atom.40 However,
the formation of silver butoxide (RCH2OAg) at the initial
stage cannot be eliminated because it is known that the coinage metal
(Au, Ag, or Cu) can form stable alkoxide.63,64 Silver butoxide can easily lose a H+, which is abstracted
by the alkali, and break the bonding with the Ag atom to form butyraldehyde.
As the O–Ag bond dissociation energy is small (221 kJ mol–1), the formation of butyraldehyde, RCHO is expected
to be large, greater the content of Ag in PdxAgy alloy. However the produced HCHO may undergo
the formation of p or q through “o” or react chemically
with butanol to form butyrate. p would form in the presence of more
Ag, and q would form in the presence of more Pd. For the Pd70Ag30@RGO electrode, formation of both the intermediates
p and q will be less, and thus-produced RCHO reacts with RCH2OH to produce a maximum amount of RCHOOCH2R. FTIR and
HPLC studies confirm the presence of butyraldehyde, sodium butyrate,
and butyl butyrate in the products. Hence, like methanol57,65 and ethanol,66 oxidation of butanol follows
a dual path mechanism (Scheme 1) with the formation of adsorbed intermediates (m) and (n).
The intermediate (m) subsequently forms butyraldehyde (RCHO) by abstraction
of H+ by OH–. The intermediate (n) loses
a H+ by reaction with OHabs to produce butyric
acid, RCOOH. The butyric acid then reacts with NaOH and butanol RCH2OH to produce sodium butyrate, RCOO–Na+, and butyl butanoate (RCOOCH2R). Further adsorption
of RCHO on the surface produces intermediates (o) and (p), which on
subsequent oxidation produces surface (s)-bound linear CO, S–CO,
which on oxidation produces the carbonate anion. The dissociative
adsorption of (o) and (p) produces the surface-bound propyl group
(−C3H7), which subsequently oxidizes
to carbonate anion and water.

Oxidation Reaction
Conclusions
We have synthesized palladium, silver,
and palladium–silver alloy nanoparticles of various binary
compositions separately on the RGO matrix by coreduction of the respective
metal precursors and GO by hydrazine at 60 °C. The as-synthesized
materials, after dropcasting on graphite electrodes, are used as an
anode catalyst for butanol oxidation in alkali. Most of the PdxAgy materials
exhibit increased and synergic catalytic activity, with Pd70Ag30@RGO being the best. Ex situ FTIR and HPLC studies
of the products of BOR reveal that butyraldehyde and butyl butyrate
are the oxidation products of butanol, whereas the tendency of further
oxidation to sodium butyrate or sodium carbonate is reduced by Ag.
The best electrode Pd70Ag30@RGO is found to
be capable of providing a constant peak current even after the 100th
cycle of CV operation. Except the expected formation of a little amount
of PdO and Ag2O, there is little change in the catalyst
material after the 100th cycle of CV operation.

Experimental Details
Reagents
PdCl2 and Nafion (10 mass %) were supplied by Arora
Matthey Ltd and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Analytical grade reagents
such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, silver nitrate, potassium
permanganate, concentrated sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium
hydroxide, concentrated hydrochloric acid, sodium butyrate, butyraldehyde,
hydrazine, and butan-1-ol were purchased from Merck, India and used
without further purification. Deionized water produced by a Milli-Q
Ultra-Pure-Water purification system of Millipore was used throughout
the experiment. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from ultrafine
graphite powder (CDH chemicals) by using a slightly changed Hummer’s
method.

Synthesis of GO Nanosheets
In a typical method of synthesis,
2.5 g of fine powder of graphite was intimately mixed with 5 g of
sodium chloride and taken in a 500 mL beaker placed in an ice bath,
followed by slow addition of 50 mL of precooled H2SO4. Then, 8 g of KMnO4 was added in steps by taking
a small portion each time along with continuous stirring, and the
temperature was carefully maintained at 10–15 °C. The
stirring was maintained for 2 h followed by slow addition of 250 mL
of Millipore water. Such addition of water raised the temperature
of the system to ∼90 °C. The mixture was then vigorously
agitated at this condition further for about 30 min. To stop unwanted
oxidation, an additional 100 mL of Millipore water followed by 30
mL of 30% H2O2 solution was added successively
that reduced the excess KMnO4. The resultant brown suspension
of GO was centrifuged and washed repeatedly with dilute HCl (1:1 (v/v)),
Millipore water, and finally, the mass was washed with alcohol and
subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 90 °C.

Synthesis of
Graphene-Supported Pd–Ag Bimetallic Nanoparticles
A simultaneous chemical reduction protocol is used for the synthesis
of graphene supported Pd–Ag alloy nanoparticles. First, appropriate
amounts of solid PdCl2 and KCl (Merck) were first mixed
in a 1:2 molar ratio with a little quantity of Millipore water in
a 100 mL volumetric flask. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 h
and kept undisturbed for 24 h. A clean brown solution of K2PdCl4 was obtained, and then the volume was made up to
the mark to prepare 0.01 M K2PdCl4 solution.
Then, 0.01 M K2PdCl4 and 0.01 M AgNO3 were taken in a round-bottom flask with varying molar (volume) ratios,
and a fixed amount of GO was added to each composition and mixed well
by constant stirring for 15 min. Then, 1 mL of hydrazine was added
to each of the solutions and stirred for 5 min at room temperature.
The immediate color change revealed fast generation of nanoparticles
with simultaneous reduction of GO to RGO. After setting for 1 h, a
black precipitate was obtained. The resultant mass was washed many
times with Millipore water, placed in a watch glass, dried by evacuation
in about 10 min in an oven kept about at 70 °C, and finally rested
in vacuum desiccators. Thus, RGO-supported different nanocomposites
of various binary compositions, Pd90Ag10@RGO,
Pd80Ag20@RGO, Pd70Ag30@RGO, Pd50Ag50@RGO, Pd30Ag70@RGO, and Ag@RGO, were obtained following the above procedure. For
comparison, separated Pd and Ag nanoparticles supported on RGO, that
is Pd@RGO and Ag@RGO, were also synthesized under a similar environment
taking the respective precursors.

Characterization
PXRD experiment of the prepared powdered samples was accomplished
using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer along with a Cu Kα
radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å generated at 40 kV and 40
mA). The surface morphology of the prepared samples was investigated
with a SEI INSPECT F 50 FE-SEM microscope. TGA was carried out in
a PerkinElmer made system under a N2 gas atmosphere using
10 °C/min heating rate. Raman spectra was executed in solid state
with 514 nm laser excitation via a T64000 Raman system (Make Jobin
Yvon HORIBA, France), with an Argon–krypton mixed ion gas laser
(2018 RM) (Make Spectra Physics, USA) as the excitation source, optical
microscope (BX41) (Make Olympus, Japan) as the collection optic system,
and thermoelectric cooled front illuminated 1024 256 CCD, model Synpse
TM (Make Jobin Yvon HORIBA, France) as the detector. The electrochemical
measurements were carried out using a bicompartment glass cell fitted
with the usual three-electrode arrangement at 298.15 K. The reference
electrode used in all electrochemical measurements was Hg/HgO/OH– (1 M) (MMO), whose equilibrium electrode potential
was 0.1 V with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. In all electrochemical
measurements, a large Pt foil (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) was utilized
as the auxiliary electrode, and potential data were registered with
respect to MMO. CV analysis was executed using a computer-aided potentiostat/galvanostat
of AUTOLAB PG STAT 12 (Eco Chemic, Netherlands). Cyclic voltammograms
of each electrode immersed in 0.1 M NaOH solution with and without
1-butanol (0.1 M) were recorded at the scan rate 0.05 V s–1 for several consecutive cycles until a steady CV curve was found.
