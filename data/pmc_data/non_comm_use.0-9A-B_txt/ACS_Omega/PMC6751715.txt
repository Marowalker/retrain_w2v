In
this work, we have tested two different extended tight-binding
methods in the framework of the quantum chemistry electron ionization
mass spectrometry (QCEIMS) program to calculate electron ionization
mass spectra. The QCEIMS approach provides reasonable, first-principles
computed spectra, which can be directly compared to experiment. Furthermore,
it provides detailed insight into the reaction mechanisms of mass
spectrometry experiments. It sheds light upon the complicated fragmentation
procedures of bond breakage and structural rearrangements that are
difficult to derive otherwise. The required accuracy and computational
demands for successful reproduction of a mass spectrum in relation
to the underlying quantum chemical method are discussed. To validate
the new GFN2-xTB approach, we conduct simulations for 15 organic,
transition-metal, and main-group inorganic systems. Major fragmentation
patterns are analyzed, and the entire calculated spectra are directly
compared to experimental data taken from the literature. We discuss
the computational costs and the robustness (outliers) of several calculation
protocols presented. Overall, the new, theoretically more sophisticated
semiempirical method GFN2-xTB performs well and robustly for a wide
range of organic, inorganic, and organometallic systems.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
structure elucidation of molecules or condensed phases
is one of the key ingredients in everyday work in chemistry and related
sciences. Over the past decades, several excellent experimental methods,
namely NMR, IR, Raman, and UV–vis spectroscopy, have been developed
enhancing the facility of solving molecular structures tremendously.
To date, it has become computationally affordable to use quantum chemical
(QC) methods to calculate the properties that are needed to predict
such spectra.1 Another extremely important
analytic tool for various areas in the organic and bioorganic chemistry
is electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS).2,3 Its
daily application, e.g., in the field of forensic drug testing4 or pharmacokinetics,5 requires continuous investigation of many new substances and their
structure–spectrum relationship. In practice, compound identification
is often assisted using chemoinformatic approaches6−8 or database-driven
programs.9,10 The ongoing development of computer-based
neural networks aims to ease this procedure.11 However, these approaches lack the basic physics and chemistry of
the EI-MS process and do not have the ability to determine the basic
reaction mechanisms leading to the observed spectra. While it is possible
to predict previously unknown structures of molecules by these methods7 the agreement with the experiments is often low.12,13

Unfortunately, the straightforward computation of the required
properties to generate accurate EI-MS is not possible with standard
theoretical techniques. To tackle this problem, statistical methods
based upon the quasi-equilibrium theory (QET)14 or the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel method (RRKM)15−17 have been developed. Downsides when using these methods arise for
larger molecules, leading to computationally very demanding procedures,
which are difficult to generalize. To overcome this problem, our group
proposed to compute mass spectra using on-the-fly computed potential
energy surfaces with Born–Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics
(BO-AIMD).18 Based on this idea, a widely
applicable protocol for predicting mass spectra termed as the quantum
chemistry electron ionization mass spectrometry (QCEIMS)19,20 method has been developed. It is, to our knowledge, the first attempt
to use BO-AIMD to calculate EI-MS in a “close to the experiment”
manner, without relying on any database or pretabulated fragmentation
rules.21 QCEIMS yields standard 70 eV EI-MS
for organic and inorganic molecules that agree reasonably well with
corresponding experimental data and gives an unprecedented insight
into the reaction mechanisms. Different QC methods for the calculation
of MS have already been tested in the past for various molecules.19,21−24 It has been shown that at least Kohn–Sham density functional
theory (KS-DFT) with small basis sets or alternatively semiempirical
quantum mechanical (SQM) methods like DFTB325,26 or OM2/OM327,28 have to be used to gain an acceptable
accuracy-to-cost ratio. With this in mind, we have implemented the
GFN1-xTB and IPEA-xTB methods into the program, and this combination
has outperformed other methods for predicting EI mass spectra with
QCEIMS.29 Very recently, we have implemented
its successor GFN2-xTB30 into the QCEIMS
code. The improved physics of this method should increase the quality
of the calculations, while the computational demands stay low.

2 Methodology
In an EI-MS experiment, a molecule is hit
by a beam of high-kinetic-energy
electrons. The impact of the accelerated electrons ejects a valence
electron from the targeted molecule and, in positive ionization mode,
creates a radical cation, as well as two out-going electrons with
continuous energy, a so-called 1e–2e process. The deposited
internal energy, if averaged over many molecules, is called the internal
excess energy (IEE) and follows a complicated distribution for which
we make reasonable assumptions.19 Its value
determines which reaction channels are eventually possible. After
the electron impact, the IEE is distributed in the vibrational modes
of the molecule through internal conversion (IC) and converted to
the nuclear kinetic energy of the corresponding atoms. The vibration
can cause bond breakage or other chemical reactions, which mostly
lead to fragmentation into smaller molecules. The potential energy
surface (PES) of the ions, which can be calculated, determines the
most energetically favorable reaction pathways.

For a more detailed
description of these processes and a discussion
of other important details that have to be considered in a theoretical
EI-MS experiment, e.g., the question where the charge remains after
the fragmentation process, the reader is referred to the original
publication19 and the textbooks.2,3

2.1 QCEIMS
In the following section,
we will briefly discuss the working principle of the program. For
more details, the reader is referred to the original publication.19

The prediction of an EI mass spectrum
by QCEIMS proceeds in three steps (see Figure 1):1. Equilibration and conformer sampling:
An initial guess of the neutral molecular starting structure will
be equilibrated in the first MD run, and a predefined number of snapshots
are randomly selected and saved to obtain starting coordinates. For
complicated cases, a preceding detailed conformational analysis should
be conducted and the entire QCEIMS procedure is then started separately
for various conformers.

2. Assignment of IEE and IC: For each
snapshot geometry, the molecular orbital spectrum is calculated by
a single-point calculation after which a Mulliken population analysis31 is performed. With this information, the internal
excess energy (IEE) and internal conversion (IC) time are estimated
and assigned to all starting geometries. The IC time is calculated
by the energy-gap law.32

3. Production runs: The snapshot structures
are instantaneously (valence) ionized and independently propagated
in time on a QC PES until a reaction occurs in the simulation. The
ionization potential (IP) of the so-created fragments is calculated
and used to determine the statistical charge of these fragments. The
fragment with the highest statistical charge is selected for further
propagation in a cascade. It can again undergo fragmentation until
either no internal energy is left or the fragment gets too small.
All charged fragments are counted and stored. Taking together all
production runs allows the program to compute the mass spectrum. The
natural isotope ratios are implied in a postsimulation treatment.



The calculations done in the program are
basically first-principles
and fully theoretical, i.e., not based upon any experimental results.
The EI-MS process is based upon a simplified theoretical model, and
the PES is approximated by quantum chemical methods. Hence, the underlying
QC method has a significant impact on the quality of the simulated
spectrum. Furthermore, the number of production runs and the maximum
simulation time can considerably alter the results. More subtle effects,
like wrong assignments of ionization potentials to the fragments or
the nature of the IEE distribution, can lead to false intensities
or even signals from unphysical fragmentation (artifacts). A more
detailed discussion of these influences can be found in the original
publication.19

Figure 1 Flowchart of the QCEIMS
protocol.

When computed spectra of this
unbiased approach used by QCEIMS
are compared to those from rule-based, chemoinformatic programs (see,
e.g., refs (6−8, 11)), it is to be kept
in mind that this “black-box” method may give rise to
results with lower accuracy. However, QCEIMS can predict EI spectra
of unknown chemical compounds and is able to retrace the composition
of the fragments created during the process from the MD trajectory.
For this reason, the program allows the discussion of the computed
spectra in a detailed way, from fragmentation patterns to recombinations
and rearrangements occurring in the experiment. At no point, intermediate
structures have to be guessed or altered.

2.2 Extended
Tight-Binding Methods
In
2017, a special-purpose SQM method called GFN-xTB33 was published as a variant to the well-established tight-binding
DFTB325,26 scheme. Recently, our group has developed
a second variant, termed GFN2-xTB,30 that
includes anisotropic second-order density fluctuation effects via
short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments.
Both extended tight-binding
(xTB) methods are designed to account for properties around the energetic
minimum, such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and noncovalent (GFN) interactions and are
parametrized for elements with atomic numbers up to Z = 86. Interestingly, the methods show an overall good performance
and great robustness also for electronically complicated situations,
including covalent bond breaking.

In GFN2-xTB, the dispersion
interactions are treated by means of a self-consistent variant of
the D4 dispersion model34 instead of D3(BJ),35−37 used in GFN-xTB, and furthermore, the description of electrostatic
interactions has been greatly improved. For a more detailed discussion
of the differences between both methods, please refer to ref (30).

The originally
proposed method is from here on called GFN1-xTB for a
better distinction between both schemes.

The computed ionization
potentials with GFN1-xTB are not sufficiently
accurate. To remedy this, a special-purpose IPEA-xTB method has been
developed. It is a reparametrization of GFN1-xTB and uses additional
(n + 1)s basis functions to better represent the
electron affinities. Unfortunately, the spectra of some molecules
containing transition metals were not described well with the IPEA-xTB
method, which partially could be traced back to wrong charge assignments.
The errors made on these systems can be fixed by calculating the ionization
potentials at the hybrid DFT (PBE038/def2-SV(P)39) level, for which the computational time is
proportionally large in comparison to semiempirical methods. For GFN2-xTB,
we did not find the need for a reparametrization because the IPs are
being calculated qualitatively correctly with this method and are
sufficiently
accurate for the charge assignment of the fragments; thus, it is likely
that use of this new method will achieve the proper results for these
systems with less computational effort. To validate this statement
and to test the performance of this method, we have tested combinations
of GFN1- and GFN2-xTB using IPEA- and GFN2-xTB for IP calculations.
To present the performance of the two methods more clearly, semiempirical
OM3-D3 calculations were performed for organic molecules. AM1 and
PM3 calculations were omitted because of the bad performance of these
methods with QCEIMS (see ref (19)). DFT was used to cross-check molecules involving transition
metal atoms. The combinations are noted as Method/IP-Method.

2.3 Technical Details
The calculations
in this work were executed on Intel XEON E5-2660 2.00 GHz cores. Computations
were performed using QCEIMS version 3.8. For OM3-D3 calculations,
MNDO2005 version 7.040 was used and DFT
calculations were gained using the ORCA 4.0.1.2. suite of programs.41−43 Statistically converged results are obtained for 1000 production
trajectories that were carried out for each molecule and method with
a maximum MD simulation time of 10 ps. Each production run required
about 10 000–20 000 QC calls. We did not alter
any settings in QCEIMS, nor did we modify the tight-binding methods
for this work. The results presented here therefore do not show the
full capability of QCEIMS, which may be improved by choosing different
simulation conditions in the program for different compound classes.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Benchmark
Set
To test the performance
of the methods, test molecules for benchmarking were chosen, which
vary in structure, size, and chemical functionality. They are designed
to involve commonly known molecules and inherit various elements across
the periodic table and were inspired by our previous work using GFN1-xTB
for EI-MS calculations.29 In Figure 2, we display a selection of
15 different molecules, sorted into three groups:

Figure 2 The benchmark set. Molecules
(1)–(6) represent the organic group,
molecules (7)–(9) represent the transition-metal
group, and molecules (10)–(15) represent
the main-group inorganic
group.

The organic molecule group includes
1-butanol (1),
hexafluorobenzene (2), uracil (3), testosterone
(4), sucrose (5), and leucylglycylglycine
(6).

The transition-metal group includes bis(benzene)chromium
(7), zirconocene dichloride (8), and nickel(II)bis(diphenyl-acetylacetonate)
(9).

The main-group inorganic group contains bis(pinacolato)diboron
(10), chinalphos (11), triphenylstibine
(12), dichloro(ethyl)aluminum (13), 2-(dimethyl-(naphthalen-1-yl)silyl)-phenyl)methanol
(HOMSi, 14), and octasulfur (15).

3.2 Timings
The computation time of all
production runs is summed up to gain the total time for creating a
full simulated spectrum. Because the trajectories run independently,
the wall timings in actual projects can be reduced by parallel runs,
i.e., they can be divided by the number of available computer cores.
Outliers will be discussed in Section 3.4.

For small organic molecules (1–3), the total calculation time for a
single spectrum (see Figure 3) lies between 100 and 250 h for all combinations of GFN methods.
For testosterone (4), computation times increase from
600 h with GFN1/IPEA-xTB to 700 h with GFN2/IPEA-xTB and up to 800
h with GFN2/GFN2-xTB. The total calculation times of the organic molecules 5 and 6 are between 300 and 400 h. For comparison,
the organic molecules were calculated with the semiempirical OM3-D3
method. The computational demands for these calculations are in the
range of the GFN calculations, with slightly shorter running times
for molecules 1, 5, and 6 and
slightly longer running times for molecules 2, 3, and 4. These results can be found in the Supporting Information (SI).

Figure 3 Total calculation time
of all test-set molecules in hours. The
molecules are grouped in their corresponding categories. GFN1-xTB
results are shown in blue, and GFN2-xTB results are shown in yellow.

For transition-metal-containing molecules (7–9), calculations of a total spectrum
using different GFN1-xTB
combinations take on average 200 h to complete, while the calculations
with GFN2-xTB for molecules 7 and 8 take
between 100 and 550 h to complete. Using GFN2-xTB for ionization potential
calculations, the timings increase. For molecule 9, both
GFN methods take more than 1200 h for the complete calculation of
the spectra. Use of DFT for this system increases the consumed time
by a factor of 4 so that the overall timing increases up to 5000 computational
hours. For a better overview in the figures, the DFT results are omitted
in Figures 3 and 4. These results can be found in the Supporting Information (SI).

Figure 4 Average failure percentage
of all test-set molecules. The molecules
are grouped in their corresponding categories. GFN1-xTB results are
shown in blue, and GFN2-xTB results are shown in yellow.

The time per calculation with GFN1/IPEA-xTB for the main-group
inorganic molecule group (10–15)
averages for all four combinations of methods between 400 and 600
h, where use of GFN2-xTB for IP evaluation takes longest. This excludes
the outlier dichloro-(ethyl)aluminum 13, for which the
timing is in the range of the small organic molecules (e.g., 1-butanol
(1)). For the molecule 15, timings with
the GFN2-xTB combinations are lower than expected, but this is due
to technical failures in the calculations, as discussed in the corresponding
results Section 3.4.

3.3 Stability
The stability of the GFN1-
and GFN2-xTB methods is evaluated by the number of successful production
runs (see Figure 4).
For both methods, the majority of runs complete properly, leading
to an excellent average failure rate of less than 1%. For the GFN1/IPEA-xTB
calculations, the largest failure rates are produced for hexafluorobenzene
(2, 3.6%), bis(benzene)chromium (7, 3.8%),
and octasulfur (15, 4.9%). For the GFN2-xTB method, failure
rates are comparable, except for the transition metal involving molecule
bis(benzene)-chromium (7), having a failure rate of 11.2%,
and octasulfur (15) (>15%). The effect on the calculated
spectrum is discussed in the corresponding results, Section 3.4.

In conclusion, low
failure rates and acceptable timings indicate good applicability of
the new GFN2-xTB method. This could not be expected because GFN2-xTB
is inherently more involved mainly due to the additional multipole
electrostatic treatment. Thus, GFN2/IPEA-xTB and GFN2/GFN2-xTB both
can be used in QCEIMS as an alternative to the GFN1/IPEA-xTB method
without significant restrictions in the computational demands or robustness.

3.4 Comparison of Experimental and Theoretical
Spectra
In the following section, we present the calculated
QCEIMS spectra using GFN1/IPEA-xTB and GFN2/GFN2-xTB. The computed
spectra are directly compared with their corresponding experimental
EI-MS obtained from the NIST44 or SDBS45 databases, and the agreement between theory
and experiment is determined by a composite matching score10,24 with a range of values between 0 (no match) and 1000 (perfect match).
Matching scores of organic molecules obtained with OM3-D3 are being
listed for the purpose of validation of the quality of spectra gained
using the GFN methods. The main differences between the results of
the two GFN methods are being discussed, with a focus on the presence
of important m/z signals as well
as corresponding variation in signal intensity. We discuss determinative
peak-series and point out interesting or important structures of the
obtained fragments, which are shown explicitly as insets in the spectra.
Major differences in signals or intensities between GFN2/IPEA- and
GFN2/GFN2-xTB calculations were not observed or were of minor influence
for the resulting spectra and are therefore not discussed further.

3.4.1 Organic Group
Small organic molecules
have already been investigated in former studies19,21,29 and are only briefly considered here.

For 1-butanol (Figure 5a), the main fragmentation pathways result from the loss of alkyl
groups. These are reproduced well by both methods with a satisfying
agreement of the simulation with the experiment. However, the survival
rate of the precursor ion is too high in the simulations, meaning
it does not decompose accordingly under given simulation conditions.
This effect is due to the IEE distribution, which is of a Poisson-type
variant and not obtained ab initio and thus can lead to a bad description
of unusual electronic situations. This can partially be alleviated
by applying higher IEE values and/or longer simulation times. These
and other effects of various simulation conditions are discussed in
the original publication.19 Differences
between the methods are found in the intensities of the signals. For
GFN2-xTB, especially the peaks of C3H3+ at m/z 39 and of C4H9+ at m/z 56 are in better agreement with the experiment. Through the high
survival rate of the precursor ion, the matching scores between the
experiment and calculations are 225 for GFN1-xTB and 223 for GFN2-xTB.
OM3-D3 calculations account better for the precursor ion signal, which
leads to a matching score of 530.

(right) to the experimental references (red, inverted) of the organic
compounds (a) 1-butanol, (b) hexafluorobenzene, and (c) uracil. The
structures of the precursor ion (denoted M•+) and
selected signals/fragments have been superimposed on each spectrum.
Important or interesting signals are highlighted by their m/z values and discussed in the text.

Hexafluorobenzene (Figure 5b) represents an interesting case. The fragment
pattern is
dominated by the ring breakage products. In the experiment, the dominant
path forms C5F3+ (m/z 117) with the remainder being CF2 (m/z 50) and a single fluorine atom (m/z 19). The loss of a single (neutral)
fluorine atom from the precursor ion can be observed by the appearance
of the signal at m/z 167. Furthermore,
the breakage of the precursor into two units of C3F3+ yields the signal at m/z 93. Both GFN methods provide similarly good results in
this respect. However, the methods differ in the calculated intensities,
as GFN2-xTB overestimates some of the signals, especially for the
fragments C6F4+ at m/z 148, C6F2+ at m/z 110, and C4F2+ at m/z 86. Matching
scores are 734 for GFN1-xTB, 647 for GFN2-xTB, and 687 for OM3-D3.

An earlier QCEIMS work has been conducted for four different nucleobases.22 These were calculated at the semiempirical levels
OM2-D327,28 and DFTB3-D3.25,26 As an example
molecule from this series, we present uracil (Figure 5c), computed with the two GFN methods. We
find that the spectra produced with both GFN methods are in good agreement
with the experiment, although some intensities of the calculated signals
are either over- or underestimated when directly compared to the measured
signals. Compared to the results obtained in the earlier work, the
spectra calculated by the GFN methods are of better quality as the
spectra are produced using DFTB3-D3 or OM2-D3. The fragmentation proceeds
via the bond breakage of the precursor ion into units of HCNO+ (m/z 43) and HNC3H2O+ (m/z 69) and the subsequent dissociation into the fragments HNCH+ and CO+ at m/z 28. Between the calculated spectra of the two GFN methods, only
minor differences in the intensities are observed. Matching scores
are 780 for GFN1-xTB, 745 for GFN2-xTB, and 711 for OM3-D3.

The experimental spectrum of testosterone (Figure 6a) contains a large number of signals, which
are overall reproduced well by the two GFN methods. Especially, the
peak series of the lower and medium mass fragments (m/z 30–150) are replicated very accurately
by both tight-binding methods when compared with the experiment. However,
neither of the two computed spectra correctly reproduce the intense
signals displayed in the experimental spectrum at m/z values 124, 203, and 246. Furthermore, the GFN-based
calculations favor the formation of the fragment C4H5+ at m/z 53 over
the experimental found fragment C4H7+ at m/z 55. Comparing the results
produced by the two GFN methods with each other, the spectrum simulated
with GFN1-xTB overestimates the intensities of the lower mass signals
in the area of about m/z 30–90,
while the spectrum calculated with the GFN2-xTB method is in overall
better agreement with the experimental results and also accounts better
for signals in the area between m/z 145 and 200. Matching scores are 532 for GFN1-xTB, 545 for GFN2-xTB,
and 592 for OM3-D3.

Figure 6 Comparison of the EI-MS computed by GFN1-xTB (left) and
GFN2-xTB2
(right) to the experimental references (red, inverted) of the organic
compounds (a) testosterone, (b) sucrose, and (c) leucylglycylglycine.
The structures of the precursor ion (denoted M•+) and selected signals/fragments have been superimposed on each spectrum.
Important or interesting signals are highlighted by their m/z values and discussed in the text.

The fragmentation scheme of sucrose (see Figure 6b) produces a considerable
amount of highly
intense signals in the experimental spectrum, notably in the area
between m/z values 28 and 73. Large
discrepancies between simulations and experiment can be observed in
the number of hydrogen atoms bound to the fragments. Especially, the
peaks from the experiment at m/z 28, belonging to CO+, compared to the calculated signal
at m/z 29 of HCO+, as
well as the experimental signal of HC2O2+ at m/z 57 in contrast to
the simulated peak of H3C2O2+ at m/z 59, are typical
examples for this divergence. Furthermore, various signals that can
be noticed in the experimental spectrum, e.g., m/z values 97, 221, and 293, and some of the less intense
peaks in between, are not well recreated by the calculations using
the GFN methods. A comparison of the simulated spectra of the two
tight-binding methods with each other reveals no significant differences.
Matching scores are 201 for GFN1-xTB, 217 for GFN2-xTB, and 169 for
OM3-D3.

Leucylglycylglycine (see Figure 6c) is composed of one l-leucine
and two glycine
residues. In the EI-MS experiment, the main decomposition pathway
leads to the fragments H6C3N2O+ (m/z 86), H3C2O2+ (m/z 59), H9C4+ (m/z 57), and HCNO+ (m/z 43). In a second step, H6C3N2O+ dissolves into H2C2NO+ (m/z 56) and H4CN+ (m/z 30).
The simulated spectra produced using either GFN1-xTB or GFN2-xTB account
for the majority of these signals in accordance with the experiment.
However, in the simulations, the survival rate of the precursor ion
is too high so that less intense signals measured in the experiment
do not appear in the calculated spectra. When comparing the GFN methods
with each other, some of the intensities of various signals differ,
e.g., peaks at m/z values 59, 86,
and 159. The latter signal belongs to an intermediate product that
gains stability through a ring formation of the peptide. The signal
of H2O+ at m/z 18 in the experimental spectrum is probably measured due to the
presence of water in the ionization chamber during the experiment
and is therefore not produced by the simulations. Matching scores
are 192 for GFN1-xTB, 224 for GFN2-xTB, and 123 for OM3-D3.

3.4.2 Transition-Metal Group
For transition
metal molecules, the ferrocene system has to be discussed explicitly.
The IPEA-xTB method yields wrong IP values and therefore leads to
false signals in the calculated EI-MS spectrum. This is visualized
by the red circle in Figure 7, where the ionized iron cation is not being charged in the
simulated spectrum (red, inverted) and thus the experimentally found
signal of Fe+ is missing. Calculating the IPs with DFT
or GFN2-xTB instead solves this problem. It is therefore recommended
to use the GFN1/GFN2-xTB, GFN2/GFN2-xTB or the GFN1/DFT, GFN2/DFT
combination for transition-metal-containing molecules. The results
presented in this section for transition-metal-containing molecules
were calculated with the GFN1/GFN2-xTB and GFN2/GFN2-xTB combinations.

Figure 7 The EI-MS
of ferrocene as an example of the impact of falsely calculated
ionization potentials. The red circle marks the signal of Fe+ that is not being reproduced by GFN1/IPEA-xTB (left). The usage
of GFN1/GFN2-xTB (right) accounts for the correct signal.

For bis(benzene)chromium (Figure 8a), both GFN simulated spectra are in satisfying
agreement
with the experimental spectrum. A detailed comparison between the
calculated and the experimental spectra reveals some divergences in
the intensities, e.g., the simulated signal at m/z 77 and the experimental peak at m/z 78, resulting from a discrepancy between the simulated
and the measured number of hydrogen atoms bound to fragmented benzene
rings. Failure rates by both methods of the GFN-xTB family were high
(see Section 3.3),
especially for calculations with GFN2-xTB. This is most likely due
to the wrong description of the Cr+ fragment, for which
the corresponding signal at m/z 52
is almost completely missing in the calculated spectrum of this method.
Instead, the protonated form HCr+ is preferred and simultaneously
the simulation fails to account for signals with low mass-to-charge
values between 20 and 40. Both calculations conducted with the GFN
methods account for the signal at m/z 104, which is created by a fragment in which a H2Cr molecule
is bound to a C4H2 chain. Matching scores are
677 for GFN1-xTB and 688 for GFN2-xTB.

Figure 8 Comparison of the EI-MS
computed by GFN1-xTB (left) and GFN2-xTB2
(right) to the experimental references (red, inverted) of the transition
metal compounds (a) bis(benzene)chromium, (b) zirconocene dichloride,
and (c) nickel(II)bis(diphenyl-acetylacetonate). The structures of
the precursor ion (denoted M•+) and selected signals/fragments
have been superimposed on each spectrum. Important or interesting
signals are highlighted by their m/z values and discussed in the text.

The Kaminsky catalyst46 can contain
the group 4 metal components Ti, Zr, or Hf. We have decided to test
the two GFN methods for EI-MS calculations of zirconocene dichloride
(Figure 8b). The experimental
spectrum reveals a variety of fragmentation pathways, from single
chloride loss of the precursor ion (resulting in a signal at m/z 256) to the cyclopentadienyl dissociation
(signals at m/z values 162 and 227).
The EI-MS created using the GFN1-xTB method is in very good agreement
with the experimental one. In contrast, the spectrum created using
the GFN2-xTB method shows an overestimation of almost all intensities
of the produced signals in comparison with those from the experiment.
Furthermore, the new approach creates various artifacts that lead
to a significant increase in the computational demands for the calculation
of this system (see Section 3.2). However, the signals computed by GFN2-xTB around m/z 201 are in surprisingly good accordance
with the experiment, which corresponds to the subsequent loss of C2H2 from the cyclopentadienyl fragment (m/z 227). These signals are not simulated
well by GFN1-xTB. Matching scores are 671 for GFN1-xTB and 680 for
GFN2-xTB.

Quantum chemical calculations of the mass spectrum
of nickel(II)bis(diphenyl-acetyl-acetonate)
(Figure 8c) have already
been conducted in an earlier publication, for which the ionization
potentials have been determined using a hybrid DFT method (PBE0/def2-SV(P)).29 In this work, we have used the IPEA- and GFN2-xTB
methods for IP calculations instead, which show great robustness and
low computational demands, as demonstrated in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. The
simulated spectra created using GFN1- and GFN2-xTB are in good agreement
with the experimental ones, regardless of which method was used to
obtain the ionization potentials, including DFT. The experimental
main peaks are being reproduced accordingly, and the intensities for
the dehydrogenated phenol (m/z 105)
and benzene (m/z 77) displayed in
the experiment are reconstructed well by both methods. The simulations
fail to recreate the peak intensities as measured in the experiment
for the signal at m/z 282 and the
precursor ion m/z 504. Some artifacts
are found in both simulated spectra, although we note a somewhat better
performance of GFN2-xTB compared to its predecessor. Matching scores
are 805 for GFN1-xTB and 830 for GFN2-xTB.

3.4.3 Main-Group
Inorganic Group
Bis(pinacolato)diboron
(Figure 9a) is an interesting
compound related to Suzuki coupling reactions.47 In the EI-MS simulations, the fragmentation patterns can
be retraced convincingly, as indicated by the good agreement between
experimental and calculated spectra. The main fragmentation pathway
is characterized by the cleavage of CH3+ and
C3H6+ from the alkane groups of the
molecule. These fragments themselves emerge in the lower mass area
of the spectrum at m/z values 15
and 42 with various constellations in the number of hydrogen atoms
bound to these fragments. This fragmentation is followed by various
rearrangement reactions: In the first step, one of the C6H12 (m/z 84) side chains
splits off from the molecule, which leads to a rearrangement of the
remaining fragment, creating a (O2-)B-O-B(-O) chain (m/z 169). In the second rearrangement step,
the remote O-B-O unit substitutes an oxygen atom at one of the side
chains, which leads to the decomposition of the structure into two
units of O-B-O-C-(CH3)2+, displayed
by the signal at m/z 84. The detailed
description of this process shows the outstanding capabilities of
QCEIMS to analyze rearrangement procedures during EI-MS experiments,
demonstrating its usefulness in elucidating structures and complex
reaction mechanisms. Overall, we find the agreement between calculated
spectra using the GFN methods and the experimentally measured spectrum
to be very satisfying, as the two GFN methods account for the majority
of signals. GFN2-xTB seems to perform better here since the agreement
with the intensities measured in the experiment is slightly better
than in the spectrum created with GFN1-xTB. Both methods overestimate
the signals at m/z values 41 and
42, as well as the survival rate of the precursor ion. Matching scores
are 245 for GFN1-xTB and 250 for GFN2-xTB.

computed by GFN1-xTB (left) and GFN2-xTB2
(right) to the experimental references (red, inverted) of the main-group
inorganic compounds (a) bis(pinacolato)diboron, (b) chinalphos, and
(c) triphenylstibine. The structures of the precursor ion (denoted
M•+) and selected signals/fragments have been superimposed
on each spectrum. Important or interesting signals are highlighted
by their m/z values and discussed
in the text.

The simulated MS of the insecticide
chinalphos (Figure 9b) matches the experimental
spectrum badly. The computed signal at m/z 145 is generated by the fragmentation of the precursor
ion into a SP(OC2H5)2+ fragment, which differs from the experimental signal at m/z 146 due to a hydrogen atom bonded less
to the fragment. The signal at m/z 157, which is almost totally missing
in the simulation, is generated due to the rearrangement
of a CH3 fragment (which dissociates from the SP(OC2H5)2+ group) between the
benzene ring and one of the nitrogen atoms. This rearrangement is
rarely reproduced in the simulation since the required migration of
the methane group can progress into all spatial directions and is
not often aligned at the ring system. In contrast to its predecessor,
the simulation with the GFN2-xTB method displays a higher probability
that in a first step the sulfur atom breaks from the precursor ion,
which resolves in an intense fragment signal at m/z 266. This is followed by the decomposition of
this fragment into the PS(OC2H5)2+ fragment, generating the signal at m/z 121. Matching scores are 598 for GFN1-xTB and
510 for GFN2-xTB.

In the spectrum of triphenylstibine (Figure 9c), the dominant
fragmentation pattern corresponds
to the cleavage of the phenyl groups and their subsequent dissociation,
which has already been reported in an earlier publication using GFN1-xTB
for structure elucidation.29 We find that
the simulated spectra using both GFN methods are in good agreement
with the experimental data, but simulations using the GFN1-xTB method
yield small artifacts throughout the spectrum. In contrast, the spectrum
created using GFN2-xTB does not display any artifacts, and the method
reduces the survival rate of the precursor ion to match the experiment
almost perfectly. Furthermore, use of GFN2-xTB improves the intensities
of the signals at m/z values 198
and 154 when compared to those from the experiment, where the latter
signal describes the bond formation between two phenyl groups. The
agreement between the simulated and the experimental signal of HSb+ at m/z 123 is better when
using the GFN2-xTB method instead of GFN1-xTB. Matching scores are
642 for GFN1-xTB and 664 for GFN2-xTB.

The spectrum of dichloro(ethyl)aluminum
(Figure 10a) indicates
competing fragmentation reactions.
The signals at m/z values 29 and
97 describe the loss of the ethane group, forming Cl2Al+ and C2H5+, while the signals
at m/z values 36 and 91 are generated
by the loss of the chlorine atoms. The simulated spectrum of the GFN2-xTB
method nearly matches all of these findings and recreates the intensities
of the signals in the experimental spectrum in better agreement than
its predecessor GFN1-xTB. The substitution of the carbon–aluminum
bond by a single chlorine is reproduced according to the experiment,
generating the signal at m/z 64
in the GFN2-xTB-created spectrum. Matching scores are 514 for GFN1-xTB
and 507 for GFN2-xTB.

and (c) octasulfur. The structures of the precursor ion (denoted M•+) and selected signals/fragments have been superimposed
on each spectrum. Important or interesting signals are highlighted
by their m/z values and discussed
in the text.

In Hiyama cross-coupling reactions,
so-called HOMSi reagents48 are used for
carbon–carbon coupling reactions.
As an example for this group of reagents, we have chosen to compare
the simulated spectra created with GFN1- and GFN2-xTB to the experimental
spectrum of (2-(dimethyl(naphthalen-1-yl)silyl)phenyl)methanol (Figure 10b). The EI-MS spectrum
measured in the experiment contains highly intense peaks in the larger
mass region between m/z values 215
and 277 and less intense signals for small to medium mass regions
with m/z values 20–200. The
calculated spectra of the two GFN methods show a good agreement to
the experiment in the lower and medium mass regions, but the main
peaks at m/z values 215 and 259
and the survival rate of the precursor ion are displayed poorly with
both methods compared to experiment. In the simulation, first, a rearrangement
of the hydroxide molecule from the benzyl alcohol group (C7H7OH) to the silicon atom takes place. The hydroxide molecule
substitutes one of the ethane groups bound to the silicon atom, and
the resulting structure creates a signal at m/z 277. From here on, the simulated fragmentation patterns
do not seem to correspond to the bond breakage scheme of the experiment.
While in simulation one methane group is cleaved off (forming the
signal at m/z 261), in the experiment,
a H2 molecule is additionally dissociated during this fragmentation
process and the resulting fragment creates the signal at m/z 259. Subsequently, this fragment either decomposes
into HOSi+, giving rise to the signal at m/z 45 and which has a dominating intensity in the
simulated spectrum using the GFN1-xTB method, or, in contrast, forms
the CH3Si+ fragment displayed at m/z 43, which is favored in the spectrum computed
with the GFN2-xTB method. Both of these fragment signals are displayed
in the experimental spectrum. Further differences between the simulated
spectra of the GFN methods are visible in the overall signal intensity,
as the lesser intense peaks created by the GFN2-xTB method produce
a “cleaner” spectrum. However, some of the experimentally
found signals are under-represented in the spectrum at this level.
Matching scores are 315 for GFN1-xTB and 282 for GFN2-xTB.

The
simulated spectra of octasulfur (Figure 10c) strongly depend on the method used. Calculations
with the GFN2-xTB method result in a spectrum in which nearly all
signals are missing. The majority of production runs show the immediate
bond breakage of the sulfur ring into S2+ and
S3+ fragments. Hereby, the intermediate products
at m/z values 128 and 192 are strongly
under-represented and the signals at m/z values 32, 160, and 224 do not appear. On the contrary, the spectrum
simulated with GFN1-xTB is in very good agreement with the experimental
results and reproduces all signals and their intensities satisfactorily,
except for those signals corresponding to S7+ at m/z 224 and S+ at m/z 32. Matching scores are 821 for GFN1-xTB
and 213 for GFN2-xTB.

4 Conclusions
We have implemented the new semiempirical, special-purpose method
GFN2-xTB into the QCEIMS program. We have tested its ability for the
calculation of EI mass spectra and realistic fragmentation patterns
and compared the results to spectra produced by using its predecessor
GFN1-xTB. For an unbiased evaluation, neither the methods were modified
for this purpose nor did we adjust any parameters or settings in the
QCEIMS program to influence its behavior. For validation, we have
compared the computed spectra of the two methods to experimental results
gained from the NIST and SBDS databases. A wide variety of smaller
and larger organic, transition-metal, and main-group inorganic systems
have been studied. The computational demands and the stability of
various method combinations also for the ionization potential calculations
have been discussed. Most of the calculations were conducted using
the GFN1/IPEA-xTB or the GFN2/GFN2-xTB combination, which were found
to be robust and accurate.

In previous work, it has been shown
that the performance of the
GFN1-xTB method excels other quantum chemical methods in accuracy
and low computational costs for the calculation of EI mass spectra.29 One main point of this work was the question
if this can even be improved by the new GFN2-xTB method featuring
a better underlying quantum mechanical description.

For organic
molecules, both methods produce qualitatively good
results in comparison to the experimental spectra. However, GFN2-xTB
does not generally improve the calculated spectra, e.g., for hexafluorobenzene
(2), GFN1-xTB performs better, while the opposite holds
for testosterone. Notably, both methods yield somewhat less accurate
spectra for sucrose (5) than for other organic molecules.

For the calculations of the ionization potentials of transition-metal-containing
molecules, GFN2-xTB can be recommended. The best overall agreement
with the experimental spectra is obtained with the GFN1/GFN2-xTB combination.
Failure rates and computational demands with GFN2/GFN2-xTB were higher,
and the combination failed to predict important signals, e.g., the
missing Cr+ ion in the bis(benzene)chromium (7) fragmentation. For critical cases, it is advised to cross-check
the results with a DFT IP calculation. This can improve the quality
of the obtained spectra but is computationally very demanding.

Regarding timings, stability, and the overall agreement with the
experiment, the two GFN methods perform similarly for the inorganic
main-group molecules. It is recommended to apply both GFN methods
for such systems, as it is not clear which of the methods will deliver
the better result in the end. Up to this point, the only molecule
for which the new GFN2-xTB method completely fails is octasulfur (15), where the GFN1-xTB method performs very well.

Differences
between the GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB methods are mostly
observed for the calculated intensities that sensitively depend on
details of the computed PES. The new GFN2-xTB method produces fewer
artifacts in the spectra but eventually misses important signals.
Nevertheless, the results from both methods compare reasonably well
to the experimental results. It is to be kept in mind that deviations
like intensities, missing signals, and survival rates of the precursor
ion depend on technical settings related to internal energy distribution
and the ionization/heating procedure. They can be individually improved
by changing the default settings, thereby significantly improving
the simulated spectra.

In conclusion, the good quality of the
two tight-binding methods
GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB broadens the applicability of the QCEIMS program
for calculating electron ionization mass spectra. The quality of the
predicted fragmentation patterns and the elucidation of the structural
compositions have been improved by the new GFN2-xTB method. This enables
users of the program to gain a more detailed look into the EI-MS process
without the need for prior knowledge of the reaction pathways involved.

The expansion of the QCEIMS program to involve collision-induced
dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry techniques is currently being
developed in our laboratory.
