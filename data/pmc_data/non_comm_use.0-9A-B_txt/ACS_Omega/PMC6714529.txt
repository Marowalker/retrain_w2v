It is a huge challenge to have a
controllable interfacial polymerization
in the fabrication process of nanofiltration (NF) membranes. In this
work, a polyphenol interlayer consisting of polyethyleneimine (PEI)/tannic
acid (TA) was simply assembled on the polysulfone (PSf) substrate
to fine-tune the interfacial polymerization process, without additional
changes to the typical NF membrane fabrication procedures. In addition,
three decisive factors in the interfacial polymerization process were
examined, including the diffusion kinetics of fluorescence-labeled
piperazine (FITC-PIP), the spreading behavior of the hexane solution
containing acyl chloride, and the polyamide layer formation on the
porous substrate by in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
The experimental results demonstrate that the diffusion kinetics of
FITC-PIP is greatly reduced, and the spreading behavior of the hexane
solution is also impeded to some extent. Furthermore, in situ FT-IR
spectroscopy demonstrates that by the mitigation of this PEI/TA interlayer,
the interfacial polymerization process is greatly controlled. Moreover,
the as-prepared NF membrane exhibits an increased water permeation
flux of 65 L m–2 h–1 (at the operation
pressure of 0.6 MPa), high Na2SO4 rejection
of >99%, and excellent long-term structural stability.

1 Introduction
Nanofiltration (NF) membranes are widely applied in the fields
of pollutants removal, compound refinement, and water treatment.1−3 Although several traditional methods like evaporation and distillation
can meet the basic needs for industrial usage, they are still energy-consuming
and usually involve tedious procedures. In contrast, the NF process
is highly energy-efficient and could be take place at low pressure,
attracting a lot of attention both in academic and industrial fields.4−7 The typical NF membranes have a classical thin-film composite (TFC)
structure and are prepared via interfacial polymerization process,
where the diamine and acyl chloride monomers react at the water/oil
interface.8,9 In general, the NF performance could be
optimized by two effective methods, including regulating the formed
polyamide selective layer and/or the porous substrate separately to
get the maximum NF performance.10−13 Nevertheless, interfacial polymerization taking place
directly on the traditional substrates always suffers from rapid and
uncontrollable reaction, resulting in an uneven and defective polyamide
selective layer and a possible deterioration of the NF performance.
To optimize substrate properties, researchers have made numerous efforts
to adjust the porous structure and/or the substrate surface wettability.
Several methods have been proposed in the past decades by the researchers,
which include increasing the substrate porosity,14 blending the hydrophilic additives in the substrates,15 and/or modifying the substrate surface wettability.16

However, a detailed interfacial polymerization
process investigation
still remains like a “black box” because of difficulty
in acquiring quantitative measurements of this rapid reaction rate
(usually completed within several seconds). Recently, to potentially
decrease the interfacial polymerization reaction rate and reduce the
formed polyamide layer thickness, Livingston and his co-workers have
fabricated a defect-free, sub-10 nm polyamide selective layer by introducing
Cd(OH)2 nanowires as a sacrificial layer.17 At the same time, our group creatively used carbon nanotubes
and/or cellulose nanocrystals as an interlayer, which is placed between
the porous substrate and the polyamide selective layer.18,19 It is confirmed theoretically that these interlayers could adsorb
more diamine monomer by the enhanced Laplace pressure and cause reinforced
interactions between the diamine monomer and porous substrates. Although
the interlayers lead to reduced diamine monomer releasing from the
aqueous to hexane phase,20,21 it is still a great
challenge to deeply understand the effects of these interlayers on
the interfacial polymerization process.

Tannic acid (TA), as
a naturally derived product, has been widely
used for surface modification because of its abundant hydroxyl groups,
sufficient hydrogen-bonding interactions, and easy postreaction process.22−27 In the reported literatures, polyethyleneimine (PEI) is usually
applied to ensure a good adhesion between the substrate and TA molecules
through the abundant electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions.28−33 Here, in this work, in the fabrication process of NF membrane, PEI/TA
layer is simply constructed as an interlayer between the porous substrate
and the polyamide selective layer, as schematically shown in Figure 1. In addition, three
decisive factors in the interfacial polymerization process are examined,
including the diffusion kinetics of the fluorescence-labeled piperazine
(FITC-PIP), the spreading behavior of the hexane solution containing
acyl chloride, and the polyamide layer formation process taking place
on the porous substrate. The experimental results demonstrate that
the FITC-PIP diffusion kinetics is greatly reduced and the spreading
of the hexane solution is also impeded to some extent. In addition,
in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy demonstrates
that by the mitigation of this PEI/TA interlayer, the interfacial
polymerization process is well controlled. Moreover, the as-prepared
NF membrane exhibits a doubled water permeation flux of 65 L m–2 h–1 (the operation pressure is
0.6 MPa), compared with the typical NF membrane without the PEI/TA
interlayer, high Na2SO4 rejection of >99%,
and
excellent structural stability after swelling in ethanol for several
hours.

polymerization mitigated by the PEI/TA interlayer on the polysulfone
(PSf) porous substrate.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication of PEI/TA-Modified
Substrate
The procedure to assemble PEI/TA was carried out
in acidic, neutral,
and basic solutions and are shown in the digital photos in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The
results indicate that PEI/TA assembled well in the neutral solution
(about pH ∼ 7.5) through multiple electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding
interactions. At first, a nascent PSf substrate with a negative charge
of the ζ-potential of about −38 mV was immersed in a
positively charged PEI solution (concentration is fixed at 2 mg/mL
and ζ-potential is 36 mV) to ensure an electrostatic adhesion
between the PSf substrate surface and TA molecules (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Then, effects of
TA concentration and total assembly time on the PEI/TA deposition
degree (DD) (%) on the nascent PSf substrate are investigated. It
is shown that the PEI/TA deposition degree (%) increases from 2 to
7 wt %, while the TA concentration increases from 1 to 4 mg/mL and
then declines to 6 wt %, when the TA concentration is 5 mg/mL (when
the total immersion time is 6 min) (as shown in Figure S3a in the Supporting Information). In a similar way,
the PEI/TA deposition degree (%) increases from 3 to 8 wt % as the
total assembling time for PEI/TA increases from 2 to 6 min and remains
stable from 6 to 10 min (Figure S3b in
the Supporting Information, when the PEI concentration is fixed at
2 mg/mL and the TA concentration at 4 mg/mL). As a result, the nascent
PSf substrate was modified by the PEI/TA assembling process with optimized
experimental conditions of PEI = 2 mg/mL, TA = 4 mg/mL, and total
assembly time = 6 min.

The surface and cross-sectional morphologies
of PEI/TA-modified substrates were observed by field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) (Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information). It is shown that the PEI/TA-modified
substrate surfaces are uniform and smooth, with decreased surface
pores and occasional small aggregates. In addition, the surface hydrophilicity
is obviously enhanced in the PEI/TA-modified layer, which is demonstrated
by a decrease in the water contact angle (WCA) from 70 ± 8°
of the nascent PSf substrate to 25 ± 3° of the PEI/TA-modified
substrate (shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting
Information). The above-mentioned substrate properties, including
the improved
surface morphologies and increased hydrophilicity, are expected to
endow PEI/TA-modified substrates with the ability to efficiently absorb
a PIP monomer in aqueous solution.

2.2 Effect
of PEI/TA-Modified Layer on the FITC-PIP
Diffusion Kinetics
During the interfacial polymerization
process, diamine monomer diffusion is the rate-determining step because
the interfacial reaction rate is much larger than the diamine monomer
diffusion rate. Nevertheless, methods to detect PIP are usually limited
due to difficulty in labeling PIP due to the lack of appropriate UV–vis
absorbance. Here, fluorescence labeled method was used to conveniently
monitor the FITC-PIP diffusion kinetics from aqueous to hexane phase
through substrates. The fluorescence labeling procedure and UV–vis
detection results are schematically shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 (a) Synthetic route of FITC-PIP. (b) FITC-PIP
diffusion concentration
from aqueous to organic phase (without acyl chloride in the organic
phase) through the nascent PSf substrate or PEI/TA-modified substrate,
respectively, as a function of diffusion time. (c) Resulting FITC-PIP
diffusion rate k1 with diffusion time.

The results indicate that for nascent PSf substrate,
the FITC-PIP
monomer diffuses through the substrate fast in the initial diffusion
stage, then gradually reduces, and reaches a plateau. Nevertheless,
for the PEI/TA-modified substrate, the FITC-PIP diffusion concentration
through the substrate is greatly depressed by interactions between
FITC-PIP and PEI/TA-modified substrate and the blockage of substrate
pores by the PEI/TA-modified layer. The concentration in the the hexane
phase at the diffusion time of 60 s is reduced from 0.035 to 0.005
(mg/mL), and the correspondingly calculated diffusion rate, k1, of PEI/TA-modified substrate decreases from
6.133 × 10–4 to 6.617 × 10–5 (mg/mL s) compared with that of the nascent PSf substrate.

According to the theoretical kinetic model of the interfacial polymerization
process,34,35 if the diamine diffusion rate reduces, the
thickness of the formed polyamide layer will also decrease. The polyamide
layer thickness can be estimated both from the cross-sectional FESEM
images (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information)
and the inserted transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 3, exhibiting that
the polyamide layer thickness reduces from about 134 ± 6 nm for
PSf NF to 82 ± 5 nm for PEI/TA-PSf NF. Additionally, the reduced
diamine diffusion rate also has obvious effect on membrane surface
morphologies. For example, the FESEM images and the inserted TEM images
in Figure 3 show that
the polyamide surface of PSf NF is typically “nodular”
(Rq ∼ 38.4 nm from atomic force
microscopy (AFM) analysis in Figure S8 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information) in the PIP/trimesoyl chloride
(TMC) interfacial polymerization system. Moreover, the membrane surface
of PEI/TA-PSf NF (Rq ∼ 22.7 nm
from the AFM analysis in Figure S8 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information) is smooth with fewer spherical convex
than the surface of PSf NF, which could be ascribed to the retarded
diamine diffusion and the mitigated interfacial reaction.

(b) PEI/TA-PSf NF, with the inserted TEM images showing the polyamide
layer structure and thickness. (c) Schematic illustration of the confined
and suppressed diamine diffusion by modified PEI/TA interlayer.

2.3 Effect of PEI/TA Layer
on the Spreading Behavior
of the Hexane Solution
According to Young’ s equation,
the spreading behavior of the hexane solution is related to interfacial
tension as well as interfacial polymerization reaction process. As
reported in the literature,36 to better
understand the mechanism of interfacial polymerization, several studies
have put forth the idea that a co-solvent is likely to promote diamine
diffusion because it can reduce the solubility difference or interfacial
tension between two immiscible solutions. However, detailed mechanism
studies are still lacking. A typical interfacial polymerization to
construct a polyamide layer involves two steps: the immersion and
drying process of aqueous solution and then the hexane solution containing
acyl chloride is gently poured on the substrate surface to form a
polyamide layer in situ. Therefore, investigation of the spreading
behavior of the hexane solution without or with reactive acyl chloride
monomer is of great significance. We use the change in the oil contact
angle (OCA) of the hexane solution with time to examine the effects
of
the PEI/TA layer on the spreading of the hexane solution and the interfacial
polymerization process, which are illustrated in Figures 4 and S9 in the Supporting Information, respectively.

Figure 4 (a, b) Schematic illustration
of the OCA change as a function of
spreading time, with the hexane solution spreading on the nascent
PSf substrate or PEI/TA-modified substrate and (c and d) with the
reactive monomers (diamine in the aqueous phase and acyl chloride
in the organic phase), respectively.

The results of the OCA measurements in Figure 4 and Table 1 show that as nascent PSf substrate is immersed in
aqueous solution (without reactive diamine monomer), the OCA rapidly
decreases from 27 to 0° only in 280 ms. Nevertheless, in the
simulation of the interfacial polymerization process (diamine in the
aqueous phase and acyl chloride in the hexane phase), the changing
rate k2 of the OCA decreases from 96.4
to 42.0 (°/s). This result could indicate that the OCA change
is hindered by polyamide formation at the aqueous/hexane interface,
which is in accordance with the measured interfacial tension in Figure S10 in the Supporting Information. Additionally,
the PEI/TA layer would further reduce the changing rate k2 of the OCA from 96.4 to 9.8 (°/s) (without reactive
monomers in the solutions) and from 42.0 to 3.6 (°/s) (with diamine
in the aqueous phase and acyl chloride in the hexane phase). The above
experimental results give the information that during the interfacial
polymerization process, the spreading behavior of the hexane solution
is greatly hindered by the PEI/TA layer, which is consistent with
the calculated increased substrate surface free energy in Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

Rate k2 with the Hexane Solution Spreading

nascent PSf substrate (diamine and acyl
chloride)	21	500	42.0	
PEI/TA-modified substrate
(diamine
and acyl chloride)	18	5000	3.6	
To quantitatively
study the spreading behavior of solution, the
co-coefficient S is introduced. If S > 0, it means the hexane oil drop spreads instantaneously on
the
substrate surface. On the contrary, when S < 0,
the substrate surface is only partially wetted and exhibits an oil
contact angle θ. According to Young’s equation: γlg cos θ + γsl = γsg, where γlg of the organic solution hexane
is fixed at 24 mN/m and the oil solution spreads fast on the nascent
PSf substrate, thus θ can be regard as ≈0°. Therefore,
the calculation of γsl – γsg = −γlg = −24 mN/m. Nevertheless,
for the PEI/TA-modified substrate, θ′ is maintained at
a constant of 30° and γ′sl – γ′sg = −γlg cos θ′
= −20.8 mN/m. Therefore, the difference ΔS is calculated by S′ of the PEI/TA-modified
substrate minus S of the nascent PSf substrate, which
can be calculated as ΔS = S′ – S = (γ′sg – γsg) – (γ′sl – γsl) = −3.2 mN/m. The quantifiable
result shows that S′ of the PEI/TA-modified
substrate is less than that of the nascent PSf substrate, which commendably
confirms that the spreading of hexane solution is impeded by the PEI/TA-modified
layer to some extent.

2.4 Polyamide Formation Monitored
by In Situ FT-IR
Spectroscopy
As mentioned above, the PEI/TA-modified layer
both reduces the FITC-PIP diffusion rate and retards the spreading
of the hexane solution on the substrates. Nevertheless, the specific
and quantifiable effect of the PEI/TA-modified layer on the polyamide
formation process still lacks sufficient experimental proof because
of the fast reaction and difficulty in directly studying the reaction
taking place on the porous substrates. Here, in situ FT-IR spectroscopy
is used to directly investigate the interfacial polymerization of
the PIP/TMC system on the nascent PSf substrate and the PEI/TA-modified
substrate (as shown in Figure 5).

Figure 5 Three-dimensional waterfall spectra of the in situ FT-IR absorbance

on (a) nascent PSf substrate and (b) PEI/TA-modified substrate. (c)
Peak area of the absorbance band at 1640 cm–1, which
characterizes the polyamide formation process with the C=O
stretching vibration. (d) First-order derivative of the peak area
as a function of the interfacial polymerization reaction time with
PSf NF and PEI/TA-PSf NF.

The polyamide formation process is confirmed by the characteristic
absorbance peaks in the FT-IR spectra, such as the C–N stretching
at 1380 cm–1, C=C stretching at 1420 cm–1, and O=C–N stretching at 1640 cm–1 (Figure S11 in the Supporting
Information). The integral area of the absorbance peak at 1640 cm–1 characterizes the O=C–N stretching
and grows fast from 0 to 175 during the reaction time from 0 to 60
s, with the interfacial polymerization taking place on the nascent
PSf substrate. After that, the peak area growth trend is slowed down
between 60 and 200 s and tends to flatten after the reaction time
of 200 s. However, in the case of the PEI/TA-modified substrate, the
absorbance peak area increases gradually from 0 to 40 in the reaction
time of 250 s, exhibiting an obviously suppressed growth trend. Furthermore,
the calculated first-order derivative of the peak area with the reaction
time exhibits the slope of the fitting line showing that kPSf = 1.83 × 10–3 (s–2) is higher than kPEI/TA = 3.84 ×
10–4 (s–2). The experimental results
rationally point out that the PEI/TA layer can potentially serve as
a storage place for diamine monomer, resulting in the reduction of
the diamine diffusion rate and partially mitigation of the interfacial
polymerization process. The in situ FT-IR analyses (Figure S12 and Tables S3,S4 in the Supporting Information)
transform the FT-IR absorbance into polyamide layer thickness, and
the polyamide layer thickness values have good consistency with the
cross-sectional images of FESEM and TEM (as shown in Figure 3) and further evince the tendency
of polyamide layer thickness to decreasing after the introduction
of the PEI/TA interlayer.

2.5 Structures, Properties,
and Performance of
NF Membranes
The chemical structures of NF membranes were
analyzed by FT-IR/ATR and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) spectra
(shown in Figure S13 in the Supporting
Information). Vibration peaks in the FT-IR/ATR spectra at 1064, 1350,
1469, 1480, and 1700 cm–1 represent the formation
of a polyamide layer on the nascent PSf substrate and PEI/TA-modified
substrate surface. In Table S5 in the Supporting
Information, it is shown that the N element increases when the O/N
ratio decreases, with the formation of polyamide on the substrates.
Compared with the formation of polyamide on the nascent PSf substrate,
the cross-linking degree of polyamide produced on the PEI/TA-modified
substrate increases from 50 to 73%, which suggests improved selectivity
to inorganic salts.

Moreover, the WCA in Figure 6a decreases from 75° for PSf NF to 48°
for PEI/TA-PSf NF. Besides, the ζ-potential in Figure 6b increases from −38
mV for PSf NF to −8 mV for PEI/TA-PSf NF. As a result of the
combination of the reduced polyamide layer thickness and improved
hydrophilicity of PEI/TA-PSf NF, the water permeation flux increases
from 28 L m–2 h–1 (PSf NF) to
65 L m–2 h–1 (PEI/TA-PSf NF) at
the operation pressure of 0.6 MPa (Figure 6c and Table 2). As we studied before in the literature,19 the hydrophilic interlayer could play a crucial
role in dragging the water droplet from the membrane surface in the
WCA measurement, which is similar to the facilitated directional permeation
of the Janus membrane.44 The PEI/TA sublayer
is more hydrophilic than the polyamide layer. Therefore, when the
polyamide layer is thin enough, the PEI/TA sublayer would attract
the water droplet to instantly transport through the polyamide skin
layer. However, the mechanism of the hydrophilicity of PEI/TA-PSf
NF is still under investigation, which is mainly related to the fine
structure of the PEI/TA-PSf NF membrane. As a supplementary, the high
salt rejection rate arises from the synergistic effect of both size
hindrance and Donnan exclusion. The enhanced selectivity to inorganic
salts can be ascribed to the increased cross-linking degree of PEI/TA-PSf
NF, and the different inorganic salt rejection rate is in the sequence
Na2SO4 (99%) ≈ MgSO4 (98%)
> MgCl2 (72%) > NaCl (48%). Furthermore, PEI/TA-PSf
NF
also exhibits super structural stability after immersion and swelling
in ethanol for a certain period from 0 to 120 h (in Figure 6d) and show a good pH stability
in acid–alkali solutions (Figure S14 in the Supporting Information) and an enhanced resistance to stretching
(Figure S15 in the Supporting Information).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
in an interfacial polymerization fabrication process
of NF membrane, the polyphenol PEI/TA interlayer has influences including
(1) reducing the diamine diffusion rate; (2) impeding the organic
solution spreading; and (3) mitigating the polyamide layer formation
process. The optimized NF membrane performance includes both increased
water permeation flux and enhanced salt rejection rate. As a result,
this work has a profound impact on the betterment of NF membrane preparation
and application.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Polysulfone (PSf) ultrafiltration
substrates were purchased from Shanghai Mega-Vision Membrane Engineering
& Technology Co., Ltd. (China) with the molecular weight cutoff
of 50 kDa. Branched polyethyleneimine (PEI, Mw ∼ 10 000 Da), tannic acid (TA), and fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) were purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (China).
Piperazine (PIP), trimesoyl chloride (TMC), and N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) glycine (Bicine) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. Moreover, ethanol, hexane, and other
kind of inorganic salts were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. (China). These chemicals were used without further purification.
Deionized (DI) water used in the experiment was produced from a lab
instrument of ELGA Lab water purification system (France).

4.2 Preparation of NF Membranes
Nascent
PSf substrates were first immersed in ethanol for 12 h and then washed
in DI water for 1 h in order to thoroughly remove impurities in substrate
pores. Branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) and tannic acid (TA) were
dissolved in Bicine buffer solution (pH = 7.5), with the concentration
of PEI fixed at 2 mg/mL and TA ranging from 1 to 5 mg/mL. PSf substrates
were prewetted in ethanol for 30 min and fully immersed in PEI solution
for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min in order to absorb PEI coating on the substrate
surface. After that, the substrates were taken out and washed thoroughly
by DI water for three times. Consequently, the substrates were then
immersed in TA solution for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min to form a PEI/TA
layer on the substrate surface. It is worth noticing that the immersion
times of PEI and TA solutions were the same and the total assembly
time was referred to as the sum of their immersion times. The PEI/TA-modified
substrate was completely washed with DI water for three times to remove
unbounded PEI/TA monomers.

Traditional interfacial polymerization
was carried out on the nascent PSf substrate and the PEI/TA-modified
substrate using PIP and TMC as reactive monomers. At first, these
substrates were upper-side immersed in 10 mL of 0.3 wt % PIP aqueous
solution for 10 min. Then, after drying off in air for 30 min, the
excessive PIP solution was removed from the substrate surface. After
that, 10 mL of 0.3 wt % TMC dissolved in the hexane solution was then
gently poured on the substrate to in situ form a polyamide layer on
the substrate surface with a 2 min interfacial reaction time. Finally,
the as-prepared NF membranes were rinsed with DI water for three times
and then conserved in DI water for further membrane characterization.

To quantitatively measure the PEI/TA mass that assembled onto the
PSf substrate surface, the PEI/TA deposition degree (DD, wt %) was
defined according to eq 1 1  where W1 is the
total mass of the PEI/TA-modified substrate and W0 is the mass of the nascent PSf substrate.

4.3 Fluorescence-Labeled Piperazine (FITC-PIP)
Diffusion Kinetics
FITC-PIP is synthesized according to the
literature,45,46 and FITC reacted with PIP by
the following procedures. A sample of 10 mg of PIP and 20 mg of FITC
was added to 20 mL of ethanol in a round-bottom flask at room temperature.
After stirring for 3 h, ethanol was removed by vacuum distillation
and the resulting product was yellow green. After that, 10 mg of FITC-PIP
was added into 20 mL of DI water to prepare the aqueous solution at
a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. UV–vis spectra were recorded
using an ultraviolet spectrometer (UV 2450, Shimadzu, Japan) to monitor
the FITC-PIP diffusion from the aqueous phase to hexane phase through
the nascent PSf substrate and PEI/TA-modified substrate. The experiment
was performed with a home-made U-shaped device (the contact membrane
area is 4 cm2). At first, 20 mL of aqueous solution of
FITC-PIP was added in one side of the device. Then, the sample of
20 mL of hexane was added in another side of the device and a series
of 3 mL of the hexane solution very close to the substrate surface
was immediately taken out for UV–vis spectrometric determination.
The detection interval is 10 s, until the diffusion time reaches 60
s. According to the fitting straight line of absorbance at 495 nm
of FITC-PIP vs. diffused concentration in
the hexane phase (shown in Figures S16 and S17 in the Supporting Information). The FITC-PIP diffusion rate from
the aqueous phase to the hexane phase through the nascent PSf substrate
and PEI/TA-modified substrate were calculated by eq 2 2  where k1 is the
FITC-PIP diffusion rate from the aqueous phase to the hexane phase
through the substrates. Δc is the FITC-PIP
concentration change in the hexane phase and Δt is the corresponding diffusion time.

4.4 Quantitative
Measurement of the Spreading
Behavior of the Hexane Solution
To quantitatively study the
spreading behavior of the hexane solution, dynamic oil contact angle
(OCA) measurement was used. The experimental procedures were as follows:
first, nascent PSf substrate and PEI/TA-modified substrate were fully
impregnated with 10 mL of DI water for 10 min. After that, the substrate
surfaces were wiped off with a filter paper and the remaining aqueous
solution was reserved in the internal pores of the substrate, with
no surface residual solution. Then, a sample of 10 μL of hexane
droplet was gently dripped on the substrate surface to in situ monitor
the OCA change as a function of time by using the contact angle measurement
instrument (Surface-Meter, OSA 200, China), which was equipped with
a high speed camera. To simulate the actual interfacial polymerization
of the PIP/TMC interfacial reaction system, 0.3 wt % PIP and TMC reactive
monomers were added into the aqueous and hexane phases, respectively.
The OCA changing rate with spreading time is calculated by eq 3 3  where k2 is the
OCA change rate with the spreading time, Δθoil is the OCA change in the spreading process, and Δt is the spreading time.

In addition, the spreading behavior
of the hexane solution was quantitatively measured by the spreading
coefficient S, which is defined by eq 4(47,48) 4  where S is the spreading
coefficient, γ is the interfacial tensions of the solid–gas
(γsg), liquid–gas (γlg),
and solid–liquid (γsl), respectively.

4.5 In Situ Monitoring of Polyamide Formation
Process by FT-IR Spectroscopy
The polyamide formation was
in situ monitored by using FT-IR spectroscopy (React IR 15, Mettler
Toledo, Switzerland) on nascent PSf substrate and PEI/TA-modified
substrate, respectively. The experimental procedures were as follows:
the substrates were first installed in a home-made reactor and upper-side
contacted with 0.3 wt % PIP solution (10 mL). After fully immersing
in PIP solution for 10 min, the excessive aqueous solution on the
substrate surface was carefully wiped off and removed by filter paper.
The FT-IR absorbance data collection was instantaneously started by
adding 0.3 wt % TMC solution (10 mL). The online FT-IR absorbance
data with the reaction time were simultaneously collected through
spectroscopic probe, which was placed tightly on the substrate surface
(with the minimum sampling time interval of 15 s).49,50 Polyamide layer thickness was transformed from the characteristic
FT-IR absorbance by the following eqs 5 and 6 reported in ref (51) 5  where dp is the
infrared light penetration depth; λ is the wavelength of infrared
radiations; and n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the crystal and the sample,
respectively. According to empirical parameters in the reference,51n1 = 4.0 (Ge crystal), n2 = 1.50 (polyamide), and θ = 45°,
thus dp = 0.066 λ. 6  where T is the converted
polyamide layer thickness and Ab(T) and Ab(0) are the absorbances
of a characteristic band at the polyamide layer thicknesses of T and 0.

4.6 Performance Measurements
of the NF Membranes
The NF performances including water permeation
flux and inorganic
salts rejection were measured and evaluated by a self-made cross-flow
module equipment (with the effective contact membrane area ∼7.04
cm2) and electrical conductivity meter (Mettler Toledo,
FE30K, Switzerland), respectively. Water permeation flux (Fw, L/m2 h) and salt rejection rate
(R, %) were calculated by eqs 7 and 8 7  where Q, t, and A are the solution permeated volume, permeation
time, and effective filtrated membrane area, respectively. Test experiment
conditions include operation pressure of 0.6 MPa, temperature of 30
°C, and cross-flow rate of 30 L/h. 8  where Cp and Cf are concentrations of
inorganic salts in the
permeate and feed solution sides, with the feed solution concentration
fixed at 1000 mg/L.

Additionally, the long-term structural stability
of the fabricated NF membranes was examined after being immersed and
swelled in ethanol from 0 to 120 h. All the water permeation flux
and the salt rejection rate were measured for three times and the
average value of all the measured results is calculated.

4.7 Other Characterizations of the NF Membranes
The chemical
structures, functional groups, and element compositions
of membrane surface were characterized by FT-IR/ATR spectrometer (FT-IR/ATR,
Nicolet 6700) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PerkinElmer
5300). To investigate the extent of polyamide selective layer cross-linking,
the XPS spectra were analyzed to calculate the cross-linking degree
(%) by eqs 9 and 10(52) 9   10  where m and n are the cross-linked
and linear parts of polyamide layer, respectively. D (%) is the corresponding calculated cross-linking degree
of the polyamide selective layer.

The surface and cross-sectional
morphologies of the NF membranes were observed by field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S4800, Japan). Polyamide layer
structures were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM,
Hitachi 7650, Japan), with the membrane samples embedded in the LR
White Resin (London Resin Company, Reading, U.K.), cut by the ultramicrotome
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), and then mounted on copper
grids for further observation. The surface topographies were observed
by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Multi-Mode 8) in the tapping
mode. Contact angles measuring the surface hydrophilicity were evaluated
by a contact angle measuring instrument (Surface-Meter, OSA 200, China).
Membrane surface charges were measured by the electrokinetic analyzer
(SurPASS Zeta, Litesizer 500, Austria) with KCl (1 mmol/L).53 The stress–strain curves were examined
by the tensile stress test instrument (RGM-4000, Shenzhen REGER Instrument
Co., Ltd, China).
