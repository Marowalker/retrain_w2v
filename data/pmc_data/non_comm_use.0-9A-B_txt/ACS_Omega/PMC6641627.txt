Inverted organic cells are promising
devices for sustainable and
low-cost future electric generation. In this work, we present the
degradation mechanisms studied in ITO/TiO2/PTB7:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag inverted organic solar cells
(iOSCs) by impedance spectroscopy (IS). Measurements were performed
on encapsulated (controlled environment) and nonencapsulated (ambient
condition) cells following their temporal evolution under AM1.5 illumination
for several voltage biases. From the impedance spectra, analyzed in
terms of resistive/capacitive equivalent circuits, we were able to
identify that the most sensitive layers inside of the device are contact
layers. According with presented, IS technique is useful for
determining the materials that have more influence on the degradation
of organic solar cells. We demonstrate that IS is a powerful technique
to identify the limiting mechanisms and to establish the limiting
materials inside of the iOSCs.

1 Introduction
Organic
solar cells (OSCs) have become an attractive alternative
to inorganic solar cells in recent years because of their potential
to be flexible, solution-coatable, low cost and weight, semitransparent,
and easily integrated into different applications.1,2 Among
all types of OSCs, bulk heterojunction-based polymers have been the
most popular because of their high efficiencies.3 In general, this technology has adopted a standard device
structure in which the active layer is located between the transparent
indium–tin–oxide (ITO) bottom anode PEDOT:PSS commonly
used as a electron-blocking layer (EBL) and the top cathode using
metals such as aluminum (Al) or calcium (Ca) for hole blocking. However,
to prevent the corrosive interaction between ITO and the EBL, it is
necessary to devise another structure architecture. An alternative
approach is an inverted organic solar cell (iOSC) in which a transparent
hole-blocking layer (HBL) on the ITO electrode is introduced, placing
the EBL between the active layer and the top metal electrode. Thus,
high efficiencies (close to 10%3) using
inverted structures of polymeric materials as the active layer, such
as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) and semiconducting polymer (PTB7), are obtained. Given its complexity,
iOSC technology presents an enormous variability in many aspects,
particularly in terms of stability and degradation.4,5 It
is known that the performance of iOSCs is highly sensitive to oxygen
and moisture, which can cause interfacial instabilities and permanent
physical or chemical changes to the active polymer and other layers,
resulting in a reduced device lifetime.4−6 Irradiation of the iOSCs
can lead to even more complex degradation mechanisms involving factors
such as degradation of the PEDOT:PSS layer, photooxidation of metal
electrodes and other deposited layers, photooxidation of the active
polymer material and inorganic oxide nanocomposite films, and chemical
degradation of metal electrodes and the ITO electrode.4−8 To improve the stability of iOSCs, these devices are encapsulated
by using barrier materials with low permeability toward atmospheric
oxygen and moisture. Although some degradation processes are known
in the device, it is not yet distinguishable where the degradation
process takes place inside of the device. Different optical and electrical
techniques are useful for monitoring the degradation and to gain insights
about each layer in the structures.5 In
particular, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measures the complex dielectric
properties of a material for a frequency spectrum, and the results
can be interpreted in terms of the equivalent circuits with resistive/capacitive
(RC) elements associated with each layer. This technique consists
of overlapping a small voltage signal (in the frequency domain) on
the direct current (dc) bias voltage so that the impedance can be
determined under various conditions.9 The
power of this technique results from its ability to separate events
that occur at different time scales or rates and provides information
about strong carrier accumulation at open circuits, rapid extraction
at short circuits, transport in the photoactive layer, contacts, and
bulk and surface capacitance.10,11 Several authors have
used this technique in order to monitor the degradation under infrared
illumination, AM1.5, and dark conditions in iOSCs.12−15 In this work, we show that impedance
spectroscopy can be used to resolve the effect of degradation on each
of the layers of hybrid polymer–inorganic solar cells. We study
the degradation in encapsulated and nonencapsulated iOSCs under real
operational condition (AM1.5 illumination and 45% relative humidity)
by IS for different bias voltages. The precise structure, in which
we base our study, is titanium oxide/PTB7:PC70BM/vanadium
oxide/Ag deposited onto the glass/ITO substrate. IS measurements were
taken up to 77 h, and the measured spectra were analyzed by fitting
to an equivalent electrical model consisting of three resistor/capacitor
elements in series. Each parameter was associated with a different
layer, and its contributions at different frequency ranges were analyzed
by superposition of the independent RC circuits. Finally, from the
parameters extracted, the layer that presents the higher degradation
evolution was identified.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the J–V characteristics under AM1.5
illumination for an encapsulated device (Figure 1a) and a nonencapsulated device (Figure 1b) for different
storage times. It can be observed that the J–V curve for the encapsulated device varies little with the
time. On the other hand, Figure 1b shows a severe degradation of the nonencapsulated
solar cell. For the encapsulated device, the open-circuit voltage,
the short-circuit current, and the fill factor do not change appreciably,
whereas the short-circuit current for the nonencapsulated device is
reduced by 40% after 77 h, resulting in a decrease in the efficiency
by 11% with respect to its initial value (8.9%). More details from
the J–V curve analysis are
reported in Table S1. From the table, it
can be seen that the degradation of the nonencapsulated device is
caused not only by the reduction in the short-circuit current but
also by the changes in the series resistance (Rs) and in the shunt resistance (Rsh), resulting in a drop in the efficiency by 77%. These results show
quantitatively the amount of degradation of the encapsulated devices
with respect to the nonencapsulated ones. In the following, this information
will be used as a reference basis for the comparison of the IS results.

at different degradation times of encapsulated (a) and nonencapsulated
(b) iOSC structures using TiO2 and V2O5 as blocking layers and PTB7:PC70BM as the active layer.
Both devices were exposed to the air environment following the protocol
for organic photovoltaics.16

Although J–V curves show
a different behavior in their shapes, they do not provide information
on the effect of degradation on each layer within the devices. Figure 2 shows the Cole–Cole
plots of the impedance spectra taken at the specified bias voltages
for different times in the encapsulated (Figure 2a–c) and nonencapsulated (Figure 2d–f) iOSC
devices under AM1.5 illumination. In addition, the solid lines show
the best-fit curves for each measurement. All plots show the typical
arc behavior, with some deviation from the perfect semicircle shape
corresponding to an RC circuit, which indicates the presence of different
RC components in the spectra. It can also be observed that the average
radius of the arcs increases with increasing storage time at a faster
rate for the nonencapsulated devices. This indicates that the impedances
of the nonencapsulated devices reach much higher values than those
of the encapsulated ones. It is important to note that for all cases
the arc shape in the spectra is not completely closed (it does not
reach zero impedance at very high frequencies). This is more evident
for the encapsulated devices at bias voltages of 0.5 and 0.8 V, in
which values at high frequencies are shown with decreasing real part
of Z′ and constant imaginary part (Z″). Another feature that is common for the encapsulated
and nonencapsulated devices is that for increasing applied bias voltage
the radii of the arcs decrease. This is certainly related to the charge
extraction (or injected charges, under illumination and high Vbias), which appears to be very efficient in
these devices.17 The extracted capacitance
values of the equivalent RC circuits are plotted as a function of
the storage time in Figure 3 for the two kinds of cells and for the three considered applied
bias voltages. The capacitance values can be separated in three ranges
(delimited by horizontal lines in the graphs): the first one above
124 nF, the second one between 27 and 116 nF, and the third region
below 11 nF. Furthermore, these ranges are the same for the encapsulated
and nonencapsulated devices and for the different applied bias voltages.
For each range, the average value is C1 = 169.1 nF, C2 = 50 nF, and C3 = 7.7 nF. These capacitance ranges can be
related to each of the layers in the structure. By considering the
active area (A), the thickness of each dielectric
layer (dblend, dV2O5, and dTiO2), and its relative dielectric permittivities (εblend, εV2O5, and εTiO2) through the relation 1  where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric
permittivity, the capacitance of the layer can be obtained. The used
values of thickness, relative dielectric permittivities (with the
source reference in superscripts3,18,19), and the corresponding capacitance are specified in Table S2. By comparing the obtained values with
the results obtained from the experimental data analysis, the higher
capacitance range can be related to the TiO2 layer, the
medium capacitance range can be related to the V2O5 layer, and the lower capacitance can be related to the active
layer (blend).

Figure 2 Cole–Cole plots of the encapsulated (a–c)
and nonencapsulated
(d–f) iOSCs. The IS measurements were taken at three different Vbias: 0 V (a,d), 0.5 V (b,e), and 0.8 V (c,f).
The experimental data were fitted using the 3RC circuit model (solid
lines).

Figure 3 Capacitance of TiO2 (black star),
V2O5 (blue circle), and blend (red cross) over
time. The values
were extracted by modeling the IS measurements of the encapsulated
(a–c) and nonencapsulated (d–f) iOSCs. The IS measurements
were taken at three different Vbias: 0
V (a,d), 0.5 V (b,e), and 0.8 V (c,f).

The identification of the capacitance in each RC equivalent
circuit
permits also to identify the resistance for each layer. Figure 4 shows the resistance values
as a function of the storage time, extracted from different conditions
for the encapsulated (4a–c) and nonencapsulated
(4d–f) devices. The results show that
the resistance, for all layers in the encapsulated cells, varies only
slightly with the degradation time. It is remarkable that only R for V2O5 at null bias voltage reaches
its highest value of around 50 Ω, whereas the rest of the values
for all biases are below 20 Ω. On the other hand, the R values are clearly correlated with the storage time for
the nonencapsulated devices. In particular, the resistance of the
TiO2 layer increases from 119 Ω up to 662 Ω
after 77 h at zero applied bias voltage, whereas the resistance of
the other layers exhibited lower values that increase at smaller rates.
The decrease in the performance of solar cells is mainly due to the
degradation in the TiO2 layer. Such degradation may arise
because of the photochemical activation when it is in operation.20 Furthermore, the exposure to oxygen4 can also be a cause of the higher degradation
with respect to the rest of the layers. The second highest capacitance
and the second highest resistance increase with the storage time observed
in the nonencapsulated layers correspond to the V2O5 layer. This indicates that the main source of degradation
arises from the blocking layers, possibly due to the TiO2 layer,20 which is photochemically activated,
and oxygen exposure.4 In both the encapsulated
and nonencapsulated cases, the values of resistances decrease when
the applied bias voltage increases. This is related to the high charge
extraction.17 From this analysis, it can
be concluded that it presents greater resistance values because of
the blocking layers, mainly RTiO2, resulting in a drop in the fill factor, such that for the
nonencapsulated devices, RTiO2 is the main limiting factor in the performance. On the
other hand, for the encapsulated devices, the limiting factor on the
performance of the iOSCs is RV2O5 at low bias voltage but is Rblend at high bias voltage.

Figure 4 Resistance of TiO2 (black star),
V2O5 (blue circle), and blend (red cross) over
time. The values
were extracted by modeling the IS measurements of the encapsulated
(a–c) and nonencapsulated (d–f) iOSCs. The IS measurements
were taken at three different Vbias: 0
V (a,d), 0.5 V (b,e), and 0.8 V (c,f).

We analyze the contribution of each RC equivalent circuit
element
in lower, medium, and high frequencies, which dominates the performance
in both iOSCs, nonencapsulated (Figure S2) and encapsulated (Figure S3) devices.
We found the contribution of each layer in three frequency regions
(low, medium, and high) in a Cole–Cole feature. The main
contribution comes from the active layer at high frequencies (above
100 kHz), whereas at low and medium frequencies, the contributions
depend on the blocking layers. For the encapsulated devices, TiO2 and V2O5 layers contribute at low and
medium frequencies, whereas in the nonencapsulated devices, the TiO2 layer contributes at low frequencies (below 400 Hz) and the
V2O5 layer contributes at medium frequencies
(between 400 Hz and 100 KHz). The contribution is also affected by
degradation.

We obtained the resistivity of each layer by the
relation21 2  where Rlayer is
the fitting value of the resistance, A is the area
of the structure, and dlayer is the thickness
of each layer. Table 1 shows the range of the resistivity associated with each layer. The
range of the resistivity in the blocking layers ratifies the hypothesis
that charges cannot be efficiently extracted through the contacts.
These values are in the range of those reported by other groups for
TiO222 and blend23 and are 2 orders of magnitude with respect to
V2O5 obtained by electron beam evaporation.19

3 Conclusions
We presented
the electrical degradation study in terms of J–V curves and IS of ITO/TiO2/PTB7:PC70BM/V2O5/Ag iOSCs
with two possible configurations: encapsulated cells used as a reference
and nonencapsulated cells for accelerated degradation. The J–V curves show that the efficiency
of the nonencapsulated devices drops by 77% with respect to that of
the encapsulated devices because of the interaction of ambient. On the other hand, IS
analysis allowed to separately study the influence of each layer on
the degradation inside of the cells. The analysis of the impedance
spectra performed by fitting a model with RC equivalent circuits in
series allowed to identify the obtained RC parameters in three intervals,
each one related to the three active layers inside of the structure:
TiO2, V2O5, and blend layers. Besides,
this led to the important conclusion that degradation does not affect
the capacitance but the resistance of each layer. Moreover, using
this technique, it was possible to identify the main source of the
degradation in the cells: the TiO2 layer. Overall, it was
demonstrated that IS is a powerful technique to establish the limiting
materials and to identify the limiting mechanisms inside of the iOSCs.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Preparation of Devices
All fabrication
process was performed under inert atmosphere. The inverted organic
devices were fabricated on prepatterned ITO-coated glass (cathode)
substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼10 Ω/□.
Titanium oxide (TiO2), used as HBL, was synthesized by
a sol–gel method.24 The precursor
solution was diluted in anhydrous methanol with a volume ratio of
1:6 and was spun-cast in air on the top of the ITO substrates at 6000
rpm in order to obtain a TiO2 layer with about 20 nm of
thickness. Samples were left in ambient conditions for 1 h followed
by thermal annealing at 400 °C for 20 min. The active layer,
PTB7:PC70BM, was obtained by depositing a blend solution
by spin coating, yielding a thickness of 100 nm. Blend solution with
a concentration of 25 mg L–1 was prepared by dissolving
PTB7 and PC70BM (1:1.5 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene and
1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 by volume). A thermally evaporated thin film
of vanadium oxide (V2O5) with 5 nm of thickness
was used as an EBL, and finally, a 100 nm thick Ag film was evaporated
to form the anode (schematic diagram of an iOSC is depicted in Figure S1a). The active area of the devices was
0.09 cm2, defined by the geometric overlap of all layers.
Several iOSCs were encapsulated under inert atmosphere into the glovebox
by applying a UV-curing liquid acrylic adhesive. Subsequently, the
encapsulated and nonencapsulated devices were exposed to the ambient
conditions (23 °C and 45% humidity).

4.2 Electrical
Measurements
Current density–voltage
(J–V) characteristics were
measured according to the state of the art of solar cells, under simulated
solar illumination, using a Keithley 2400 (Cleveland, OH) measurement
unit and an Abet Technologies model Sun 2000 (Milford, CT), calibrated
with a Fraunhofer certified photovoltaic cell to yield a 100 mW cm–2 AM1.5 spectrum. IS analyses were performed under
the same AM1.5 illumination conditions using a HP-4192A impedance
analyzer. Impedance data were collected at three different dc levels:
0, 0.5, and 0.8 V, superimposing an ac signal with 15 mV amplitude
in the frequency range between 5 Hz and 1 MHz. Between measurements,
the iOSCs were stored under ambient conditions (23 °C and 45%
humidity) in dark, according to the International Summit on OSC Stability
ISOS standard D-1.16

4.3 Data Analysis
IS experimental data
were fitted with an equivalent circuit model consisting of three parallel
resistor/capacitance (RiCi, i = 1, 2, and 3) elements in series9 (Figure S1b). Each RC element is associated with
the resistance and the capacitance of each layer in the device. The
fitting was carried out by minimizing the relative error between the
data and the model using conventional algorithms such as simulated
annealing.25 The error in all cases was
below 2%.
