Present work demonstrates a single
step process for simultaneous
synthesis of metal-nanoparticle-encapsulated nitrogen-doped bamboo-shaped
carbon nanotubes (M/N-BCNTs) and graphitic carbon nitride (G-C3N3). The synthesis of two different carbon nanostructures
in a single step is recognized for the first time. This process involves
the use of inexpensive and nontoxic precursors such as melamine as
carbon and nitrogen sources for the growth of G-C3N3 and M/N-BCNTs. In this technique, the utilization of unwanted
gases such as ammonia and hydrocarbons released during the decomposition
of melamine is the key to grow M/N-BCNTs over the catalyst along with
the formation of G-C3N4. The implementation
of M/N-BCNTs as the electrode material for all-solid-state symmetric
supercapacitor results in a maximum specific capacitance of ∼368
F g–1 with excellent electrochemical stability with
97% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles. Furthermore, fabricated
symmetric supercapacitor shows maximum high energy and power density
up to 10.88 W h kg–1 and 2.06 kW kg–1, respectively. The superior electrochemical activity of M/N-BCNTs
can be attributed to its high surface to area volume ratio, unique
structural characteristics, ultrahigh electrical conductivity, and
carrier mobility.

1 Introduction
Carbon,
the fourth most abundant element in earth, forms various
allotropes owing to its unique electronic configuration. Among all,
carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphitic carbon nitride (G-C3N4) are mostly studied allotropes for various applications.1,2 Moreover, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) are emerged as
one of the most promising materials for energy applications such as
fuel cells,3,4 secondary batteries,5 solar cells, and supercapacitors.6 Their
unique properties such as excellent electrical and thermal conductivity,
high surface area to volume ratio, superior mechanical strength, and
good thermal and chemical stability make them an ideal material for
the aforementioned applications.4,6−9 In addition, N-CNTs when integrated with metal nanoparticles improve
the electrochemical performance of nanomaterial and are well-explored
for energy applications.10−13 For example, Li et al. demonstrated N-CNTs as a promising
anode material for sodium-ion batteries and achieved the specific
capacity of 270 mA h g–1 at 50 mA g–1. Liu et al. reported the transition metal (Fe, Co, and Ni)-encapsulated
nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as the highest efficient bifunctional
catalyst for oxygen electrode reactions. Besides, G-C3N4 is the most stable allotrope with excellent physicochemical
stability, versatile optical properties, excellent photocatalytic
activity, and appealing electronic structure.14 These unique features make G-C3N4 a very effective
material as visible light photocatalyst to split water.15−19 In addition, G-C3N4 finds specific interest
in fuel cells and solar cells because of its excellent oxidation reduction
reaction attributed to high nitrogen content.17,18

Until the present, several methods have been developed for
the
separate synthesis of N-CNTs and G-C3N4. In
general, G-C3N4 is synthesized by the polymerization
of different solid precursors such as cyanamide, dicyandiamide, guanidine
hydrochloride, melamine, thiourea, and urea at a temperature range
of 450–700 °C.17−23 Moreover, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes can be synthesized by
a chemical vapor deposition technique using various metal catalyst
particles and carbon precursor gases including methane and acetylene.
In most of the synthesis, NH3 gas or nitrogen-rich compounds
are used as the precursor for nitrogen.4,24−28 However, the synthesis temperature is very high (800–1050
°C) and the procedure is tedious. Above all, there are few reports
available demonstrating the encapsulation of transition metal nanoparticles
inside the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes.29−31 Nevertheless,
these synthesis methods are suitable for the growth of either metal-encapsulated
N-CNTs or G-C3N4. There are no reports available
combining these two separate methods to achieve N-CNTs and G-C3N4 in a single step, thereby resulting in cost
reduction and scalability.

Present work reveals a single-step
process for the simultaneous
synthesis of metal nanoparticle-encapsulated nitrogen-doped bamboo-shaped
carbon nanotubes (M/N-BCNTs) and G-C3N4 using
nontoxic and inexpensive precursors at low temperature. Present approach
is the simplistic way to synthesize metal-encapsulated N-CNTs and
G-C3N4 in a single step. Electrochemical studies
reveal that novel M/N-BCNTs is a promising electrode material for
all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor with excellent rate capability
and cyclic stability. Because the photocatalysis,17,32 electrocatalysis,33 and electrochemical34,35 assets of G-C3N4 is already reported and eventually
confirmed that G-C3N4 is a promising material
for water splitting, fuel cells, solar cells, and actuator; present
work is focused on the electrochemical aspect of M/N-BCNTs for symmetric
supercapacitors.

2 Results and Discussion
Here, the simultaneous synthesis of M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4 was achieved through a single step using single-furnace
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) unit at a specific temperature. The
schematic representation of the synthesis method is shown in Figure 1a. Two ceramic boats
containing melamine in one boat and catalyst in another boat were
kept at the center of the CVD unit. The temperature of the furnace
was raised to the required temperature in the inert atmosphere of
argon/nitrogen. Initially, optimization was carried out to obtain
M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4 in a single step by performing
the synthesis at different temperatures ranging from 600 to 800 °C.
At 600–650 °C, melamine from first boat undergoes polymerization
and results in the formation of G-C3N4. However,
the growth of M/N-BCNTs did not occur in the second boat. This indicates
that 600 °C temperature was insufficient for the growth of N-BCNTs.
The reason for this can be explained from a vapor–liquid–solid
(VLS) growth mechanism. It is already established that carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) follow VLS growth mechanism, where hydrocarbon vapors interact
with molten catalysts to form CNTs.36 Low
temperature (600–650 °C) is not suitable to achieve the
molten state of the catalyst to undergo VLS mechanism, and thus the
growth of N-BCNTs was not observed at low temperatures. Next, the
temperature of the furnace was increased to 700 °C. At this temperature,
G-C3N4 and M/N-BCNTs were obtained in separate
boats, as shown in Figure 1b. As explained earlier, polymerization of melamine leads
to the formation of G-C3N4. Interestingly, during
polymerization, vapors consisting of ammonia and hydrocarbons were
released as byproducts (Figure S1), which
further undergo catalytic decomposition at the surface of molten catalyst
particles and results in the growth of M/N-CNTs. Next, the increase
in temperature up to 800 °C results in the growth of M/N-BCNTs
in a second boat; however, G-C3N4 was decomposed
completely (this is further confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) of G-C3N4 (Figure S2) and no residue was seen in the first boat (Figure 1b).

the synthesis of M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4. (b) Effect
of temperature on the growth of M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4.

Figure 2 represents
the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for G-C3N4, Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs, and Fe/N-BCNTs. Powder XRD pattern
of G-C3N4 shows a very sharp characteristic
peak at ∼27.8° corresponding to the C(002) graphite plane
with the d-spacing of ∼0.32 nm for the interlayer
stacking of aromatic systems. A small peak at 13° can be indexed
to the C(100) plane corresponding to the in-planer structural repeat
unit with a period of 0.68 nm.37−39 Powder XRD pattern of G-C3N4 confirms the complete decomposition of melamine
and formation of G-C3N4. The as-grown M/N-BCNTs
show C(002) peak at ∼26° corresponding to the hexagonal
graphite along with the metal peaks. Ni/N-BCNTs nanocomposite illustrates
the major peaks between 20° and 70° which can be indexed
to a cubic structure of Ni (ref. no. 00-001-1258, Fm3m (225), a = b = c = 0.354 nm). The intense peaks at 44.6°,
51.6°, and 76.1° correspond to (111), (200), and (220) planes
of cubic Ni, respectively. Powder XRD pattern of Co/N-BCNTs shows
intense peaks at 44.2°, 51.5°, and 75.8° which can
be indexed to (111), (200), and (220) planes of the cubic Co structure
(ref. no. 00-015-0806, Fm3m (225), a = b = c = 0.354 nm),
respectively. For Fe/N-BCNT nanocomposite, powder XRD pattern shows
a small peak at 44.3° corresponding to the (110) plane of cubic
Fe (ref. no. 01-085-1410, Im3m (229), a = b = c = 0.288 nm)
along with the C(002) peak of N-BCNTs.

Figure 3 represents
the Raman spectrum for G-C3N4. Two dominant
peaks, peak A and B, at 706 and 1232 cm–1 obtained
in the Raman spectrum are ascribed to different kinds of s-triazine ring breathing mode present in the G-C3N4 structure.40 Peak C located at
1310 cm–1 correspond to the stretching mode of s-triazine ring.40,41 Moreover, a small peak
at 978 cm–1 correspond to the symmetric breathing
mode of s-triazine ring in G-C3N4 lattice.2 In addition, Raman spectra
depicted in Figure 3 act as a tool for determining the relative defect concentrations
present in carbon-based nanocomposites. G band is the characteristic
band for all graphitic systems, arising because of the stretching
vibration of C–C bonds in sp2 hybridization. The
presence of defects in sp2 hybridized carbon network gives
rise to D band in Raman spectrum. 2D band at ∼2635 cm–1 arises because of the stacking order of graphite planes. The ratio
of intensity of the characteristic D band and G band provides the
information of defect content in the system. Raman spectra of Ni/N-BCNTs,
Co/N-BCNTs, and Fe/N-BCNTs are depicted in Figure 3 and show distinct G and D bands at 1318
and 1585 cm–1, respectively. A large defect ratio
of Ni/N-BCNTs (ID/IG = 1.25), Co/N-BCNTs (ID/IG = 1.19), and Fe/N-BCNTs (ID/IG = 1.25) confirms the
disorder nature of N-BCNTs. Typically, there are two major factors
that could increase the intensity of D band; one is the introduction
of heteroatoms such as nitrogen in the carbon network, and the other
is curvatures and the edges of the N-BCNTs.

and Fe/N-BCNTs.

Thermal stability of
G-C3N4 was studied using
TGA in air and nitrogen atmosphere. Initial weight loss up to 150
°C can be attributed to the adsorbed water molecules on the surface
of G-C3N4. The nature of the TGA curve is similar
in air and nitrogen atmosphere. However, the complete decomposition
occurs at ∼770 °C in air atmosphere and 790 °C in
nitrogen atmosphere. Thus, it can be inferred that the thermal stability
of G-C3N4 is slightly more in nitrogen atmosphere
relative to air atmosphere. TGA of Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs, and Fe/N-BCNTs
is shown in Figure S3. TGA plots of nanocomposites
show no major weight loss until ∼550 °C indicating the
absence of amorphous carbon in as-grown M/N-BCNTs. Thus, this technique
avoids the formation of unwanted amorphous carbon in nanocomposites.
The major weight loss taking place above 500 °C is ascribed to
the complete decomposition of carbon–nitrogen network from
M/N-BCNTs. The residue left above 600 °C for Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs,
and Fe/N-BCNTs is 22.1, 12.2, and 14.4%, confirming the presence of
metal nanoparticles in the composite, respectively. The amount of
metal content in M/BCNTs was calculated using the following equation  

The calculated metal
content for Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs, and Fe/N-BCNTs
is 17.7%, 11.6%, and 4.4%, respectively.

The morphologies, structure,
and the presence of metal nanoparticles
were examined from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. SEM
images shown in Figure 4a,b depict the sheetlike porous morphology of G-C3N4. SEM images of Ni/N-BCNTs (Figure 4c,d), Co/N-BCNTs (Figure 4e,f), and Fe/N-BCNTs (Figure 4g,h) demonstrate that the large quantity
of nanotubes was formed with several micrometer lengths. Further,
elemental analysis of G-C3N4, Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs,
and Fe/N-BCNTs was carried out using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) and presented in Figure 2i. EDX measurement of G-C3N4 confirms
that the carbon and nitrogen are main constitution elements. EDX analysis
of Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs, and Fe/N-BCNTs exhibits the dominant constitution
of carbon along with nitrogen, oxygen, and metals (Ni, Co, and Fe).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
Ni/N-BCNTs (Figure 5a–c), Co/N-BCNTs
(Figure 5d–f),
and Fe//N-BCNTs (Figure 5g–i) reveal the bamboolike hollow structure of nanotubes with
metal nanoparticles encapsulated within the tube, the presence of
which is confirmed from powder XRD. The nanotubes are composed of
several compartments, which result in the bamboo-shaped morphology.

Figure 5 TEM images
for (a–c) Ni/N-BCNTs, (d–f) Co/N-BCNTs,
and (g–i) Fe/N-BCNTs at different magnifications.

Ni/N-BCNTs and Fe/N-BCNTs show a similar structure
with wall thicknesses
of ∼13 nm (Figure 5c) and ∼14 nm (Figure 5i) with noticeable compartments. In cases of Co/N-BCNTs,
the thickness of the wall is more (∼16 nm) and compartments
are small (Figure 5f) and not prominent. Bamboo-shaped morphology and compartment formation
are mainly because of the incorporation of nitrogen atom in carbon
lattices. Thus, the structure is dependent on the amount of nitrogen
doping in nanotubes. It is reported that the solubility of nitrogen
is maximum in Ni, followed by Fe and Co.42,43 Also, EDX measurements show that the nitrogen content is less in
Co/N-BCNTs compared to Ni/N-BCNTs and Fe/N-BCNTs. Thus, the structural
variation in Co/N-BCNTs can be attributed to a lesser amount of incorporated
nitrogen atoms in carbon lattice. High-resolution TEM images reveal
that the wall of nanotubes is composed of several layers of wrinkled
lamellate graphene having 0.34 nm d-spacing. The
unique arrangement of these graphene layers, similar to the herringbone
pattern, results in the variation in the wall thickness from ∼14
nm to as thin as ∼3 nm. Figure S4a–c shows the TEM image at low magnification, and it is observed that
the length of the nanotubes is several micrometers with most of the
nanoparticles encapsulated inside the tubes. Also, very few nanoparticles
are observed outside the tube and can be assigned to unreacted catalysts. Figure S4d–f clearly depicts that the
tip of the nanotubes is encapsulated with metal nanoparticles.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to examine the chemical
composition and electronic states of elements in M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4. The survey spectrum was recorded as a function
of binding energy ranging from 0 to 1050 eV. Figure S5 shows the survey spectrum recorded for M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4 confirming the presence of carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen. Additionally, survey spectra of Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs,
and Fe/N-BCNTs depict the peaks for Ni, Co, and Fe, respectively.
The prepared nanomaterials, that is, Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs, and Fe/N-BCNTs
have a high nitrogen content (∼5 at. %). The high-resolution
spectra of C 1s for Ni/N-BCNTs (Figure 6a), Co/N-BCNTs (Figure 6b), and Fe/N-BCNTs (Figure 6c) are deconvoluted into four major peaks
corresponding to sp2 C=C (284.5 eV), C–N
(285.5 eV), C=O (286.4 eV), and N–C=O (290.1
eV). Figure 6d,e, respectively,
represents the high-resolution spectra of N 1s for Ni/N-BCNTs, Co/N-BCNTs,
and Fe/N-BCNTs. The deconvoluted spectra of N 1s show the four distinct
peaks attributed to pyridinic N (398.4 eV), pyrrolic N (400.1 eV),
graphitic N (401.4), and oxidized N (404.0 eV). The schematic representation
of aforesaid nitrogen types is depicted in Figure S6. Meanwhile, the high-resolution deconvoluted spectra of
Ni 2p (Figure 6g) exhibit
two peaks at 852.9 and 870.1 eV corresponding to Ni0, and
peaks at 854.7 and 872.3 eV assigned to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni
2p1/2 reveal the presence of Ni2+ because of
surface oxidation of Nickel.44,45Figure 6h presents the deconvoluted spectra for Co
2p having peaks at 778.0 and 793.6 eV related to Co0. Peaks
at 780.9 and 795.7 eV are, respectively, assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, which is due to the surface oxidation of
elemental Co.46,47 Similarly, the spectrum of Fe
2p (Figure 6i) deconvoluted
into three peaks at 707.6, 709.5, and 719.3 eV are ascribed to Fe0, whereas two peaks located at 711.6 and 722.1 eV, respectively,
belong to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2.45,48,49 Moreover, the presence of satellite
peaks in deconvoluted spectra indicates the oxidized element.

The deconvoluted C 1s spectrum for G-C3N4 (Figure 7a) shows
major two peaks assigned to sp2-bonded N–C=N
and graphitic carbon. The N 1s spectrum can be fitted to four distinct
peaks, as shown in Figure 7b. Peaks located at 398.4 and 399.0 eV are assigned to C–N=C
and N–C(3) arising because of the graphitic nature of G-C3N4, respectively. The peak at 400.6 eV corresponds
to nitrogen bonded with three carbon atoms in the aromatic ring. The
schematic representation of carbon and nitrogen species in G-C3N4 is shown in Figure S7. A small peak located at 404.4 eV is attributed to π-excitations
and charging effect.50

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area (Figure 8a–d) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size and pore volume (Figure 8e–h) analyses indicate that M/N-BCNTs
and G-C3N4 exhibit high surface and porous structure.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size
distribution curves indicate that M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4 show type-IV characteristics confirming the mesoporous structure.
The specific surface area, pore size, and pore volume for M/N-BCNTs
and G-C3N4 are listed in Table 1. The specific area of the as-grown M/N-BCNTs
and G-C3N4 obtained by this method is nearly
three times more than the previously reported values.15,51,52 These data exemplify that the
nanostructures obtained using this optimized technique introduce porous
structures with high surface area, enhanced pore volume, and narrow
pore-size distribution.

Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) curves for Ni/N-BCNTs-, Co/N-BCNTs-, and
Fe/N-BCNTs--based solid-state supercapacitors at different scan rates
are displayed in Figure 9a–c. An almost rectangular shape of CV curves confirms the
good capacitive behavior. The weak redox peak in CV profiles is the
consequence of the pseudocapacitive behavior of quasi-reversible faradic
reactions occurring on the surface metal nanoparticles present in
nanocomposites. Once the system attains stability, all metal atoms
can contribute to the electrochemical reaction, and the reaction during
charge–discharge (CD) can be given as: Ni(II) ↔ Ni(III),
Co(II) ↔ Co(III), and Fe(II) ↔ Fe(III). The detailed
pseudocapacitive mechanism is explained in the Supporting Information Even at high scan rates, CV curves
retain the shape without any distortion implying the desirable quick
CD property of the supercapacitor. Further, CD studies at different
current densities were carried out in the potential window of 0–1
V. Figure 9d–f
shows that CD curves are nearly symmetric, thereby further confirming
the typical capacitive characteristics coupled with fast CD behavior
of the solid-state supercapacitor. Specific capacitance was calculated
using the relation, 1  where Cs is the
specific capacitance; I, t, m, and ΔV are the applied current,
discharge time, active mass of one electrode, and potential window,
respectively. Ni/N-BCNTs-, Co/N-BCNTs-, and Fe/N-BCNTs-based supercapacitors
show maximum specific capacitance of 368, 358, and 236 F g–1 at a current density of 2 A g–1, respectively.
CD profiles at different current densities show a very small IR drop confirming the low equivalent series resistance
attributed to good electrical conductivity of the electrode. Figure S8 summarizes the results obtained from
CD curves at different current densities. As illustrated in Figure S8a–c, the specific capacitance
declines with the increasing current density. This can be explained
as: at low current density, the ample time facilitates complete access
of the active ions to the electrode. Whereas at high current density,
because of fast CD, active ions did not have enough time to access
the electrode.54 The fabricated solid-state
supercapacitors retain ∼87% of the specific capacitance even
at a high current density of 10 A g–1 indicating
high rate capability.

The energy density (Es) and power density
(Ps) were calculated using the following
equations69 2   3  

The Ragone plot presented in Figure S8d clearly shows that Ni/N-BCNT-based solid-state supercapacitor delivers
an energy density of 9.5 W h kg–1 corresponding
to a power density of 2.63 kW kg–1 and remains 7.98
W h kg–1 at a high power density of 8.8 kW kg–1. Similarly, Co/N-BCNT and Fe/N-BCNT solid-state supercapacitors
exhibit maximum energy density of 10.88 and 6.4 W h kg–1 at 2.06 and 1.99 kW kg–1 power densities (Figure S8e,f), respectively. It is noteworthy
that the fabricated symmetric all solid-state supercapacitors exhibit
high energy and power density compared to previous reports on the
symmetric supercapacitor, as shown in Figure 10.63−68,70,71 For example, Chen et al. obtained a maximum energy density of 6.07
W h kg–1 for activated nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber-based
symmetric supercapacitor.63 Wahid et al.
reported the maximum energy density of 7 W h kg–1 at a high power density of 5000 W kg–1 for the
supercapacitor based on yogurt-derived nitrogen-doped carbon.64 Thus, the fabricated solid-state supercapacitors
are promising devices with superior energy and power density.

supercapacitor with extant literature.

Table 2 gives
the
comparison of electrochemical properties of different electrode materials
for the supercapacitor. It is very clear that most of the N-doped
structures are activated to increase the porosity and thus follows
multistep. The key difference between these materials and M/N-BCNTs
is that no extra precursors for nitrogen are required, and the synthesis
strategy is cost-effective, facile, and scalable. The symmetric supercapacitor
based on Ni/N-BCNTs shows better electrochemical performance compared
to the various mentioned electrode materials. This can be attributed
to the synergistic effect of various aspects. Commonly, electrochemical
supercapacitors are divided into two types based on the energy-storage
mechanism and the electrode material: electric double-layer capacitors
(EDLCs) and the pseudocapacitors. The EDLCs store energy through electrostatic
electric charge accumulation at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces,
which is solely a physical process. In contrast, the pseudocapacitors
store energy through a faradic process, which includes fast and reversible
redox reactions on the surface of electrodes. These two mechanisms
can work distinctly or can be merged together in a single device,
and purely based on the electrode materials used in the supercapacitors.
In general, carbon-based materials exhibit EDLC mechanism, whereas
metal, metal oxides/hydroxides/sulfides show pseudocapacitance. In
the present study, M/N-BCNTs lead to the synergistic effect of EDLC
and pseudocapacitor energy-storage mechanisms, thereby resulting in
faster kinetics and enhanced electrochemical capacitive performance.
Additionally, the superior electrochemical performance of Ni/N-BCNTs
can be attributed to several factors which include: (i) high electrical
conductivity and carrier mobility, (ii) more nitrogen and elemental
Ni content, and (iii) high surface area and pore volume resulting
into easy access of electrolyte ions into the structure relative to
Co/N-BCNTs and Fe/N-BCNTs. Electrical conductivity and carrier mobility
of nanomaterials are evaluated using Hall effect measurements (van
der Pauw method) performed at room temperature and tabulated in Table 3. Thus, the level
of nitrogen doping, surface area, pore volume, electrical conductivity,
and carrier mobility play a vital role in determining the electrochemical
performance of nanomaterials.

Long-term
cyclic stability is an essential requirement for energy-storage devices. Hence, the cyclic
stability test for Ni/N-BCNTs-, Co/N-BCNTs-, and Fe/N-BCNTs-based
solid-state supercapacitor was performed by repeating CD measurements
10 000 times in the potential window of 1 V at a constant current
density of 5 A g–1. Figure S8g–i represents the capacitance retention of the supercapacitor as a
function of cycle number. Fabricated solid-state supercapacitor exhibits
∼97% of capacity retention at the end of 10 000 cycles,
confirming excellent cyclic stability and reversibility. The excellent
cyclic stability of Ni/N-BCNTs-, Co/N-BCNTs-, and Fe/N-BCNTs-based
supercapacitors is attributed to the unique structure of M/N-BCNTs
where metal nanoparticles are encapsulated within the carbon network.
Encapsulation of nanoparticles constrains the volume expansion because
the redox reaction occurs during CD and eventually leads to excellent
stability of the electrode material. Thus, M/N-BCNTs are a promising
electrode material for supercapacitors owing to their unique structure,
electrical conductivity, high specific capacitance, good power, and
energy density accompanied by excellent cyclic stability. Moreover,
supercapacitors are restricted toward commercialization because of
high cost per unit of energy stored, which are mainly due to electrode
material and fabrication process. The present technique can reduce
the cost of electrode material by ∼90%, thereby proposing a
promising step toward commercialization.

3 Conclusions
The present study demonstrates the simultaneous synthesis of M/N-BCNTs
and G-C3N4 in a single step using nontoxic and
inexpensive precursors. Formation, structure, and surface morphology
of samples were successfully illustrated using different techniques.
The BET surface area studies show that M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4 exhibit remarkable surface area and highly mesoporous
structure which provides the platform for fast diffusion of electrolyte
ions. The as-grown M/N-BCNTs integrate unique assets for electrochemical
process, such as encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within the bamboolike
carbon–nitrogen-rich network, extremely high electrical conductivity,
and carrier mobility. The synergistic effect of the aforementioned
merits results in a high specific capacitance (∼368 F g–1) accompanied by a good rate capability and excellent
cyclic stability over 10 000 cycles. Fabricated all-solid-state
symmetric supercapacitors using Co/N-BCNTs show the maximum energy
density of 10.88 W h kg–1 at 2.06 kW kg–1, demonstrating excellent supercapacitor performance.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Material Synthesis
M/N-BCNTs and
G-C3N4 were synthesized simultaneously using
the CVD system (Figure 1a). It consists of a single tubular furnace with a quartz tube mounted
inside. Two alumina boats are kept at the center of the furnace. Melamine
(4 g), as carbon and nitrogen source, was kept in one boat, and the
catalyst MCl2·6H2O (M = Fe, Co, and Ni,
400–500 mg) was kept in the other boat. The quartz tube was
closed at both ends using aluminum end couplers, which have the inlet
and outlet for the argon/nitrogen gas. At first, argon gas (160 sccm)
was purged inside the chamber for 10 min to create the inert atmosphere
and continued throughout the experiment. Next, the temperature of
the furnace was raised to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1. The temperature of the furnace was maintained
at 700 °C for 30 min and then allowed to cool down naturally.
The as-grown products were labeled as M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4. The experiment was repeated by replacing melamine
with dicyandiamide and a catalyst with conventional Ni(OH)2 under similar parameters. Interestingly, in this case also, the
growth of M/NBCNTs and G-C3N4 was observed with
a similar morphology. The formation and the structure of samples were
confirmed from the XRD pattern (Figure S9), SEM, and TEM (Figure S10). Thus, it
can be proved that this method is clearly generic and applicable to
most of the solid precursors such as dicyandiamide, thiourea, urea,
and guanidine hydrochloride. Moreover, the synthesis process allows
the use of metal precursors (MCl2·6H2O;
M = Fe, Co, and Ni), metal nanoparticles (Fe, Ni, and Co), metal oxides
(Fe3O4, NiO, and CoO), and metal hydroxides
[Fe(OH)3, Co(OH)2, and Ni(OH)2] as
a catalyst for the growth of M/N-BCNTs.

4.2 Material
Characterization
The formation
of M/N-BCNTs and G-C3N4 was studied through
an XRD pattern recorded from 2θ = 5° to 2θ = 90°
using PANalytical X’pert Pro powder X-ray diffractometer using
a nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) source.
Raman spectroscopic measurements were carried out using LabRAM HP800
UV Raman equipped with a He–Ne laser of 632 nm excitation.
Inspect F50 high-resolution SEM and FEI Tecnai T20 high-resolution
TEM were used to study the surface morphology and structure of M/N-BCNTs
and G-C3N4. EDX measurements were carried out
using Inspect F50 SEM. The TA instrument (SDT Q600) equipped with
a microbalance system was used to carry out the TGA. XPS analysis
was carried out using SPECS X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped
with a Mg K X-ray source and a PHOIBOS 100MCD semicircular analyzer
at ultrahigh vacuum, that is, 10–10 mbar. Recorded
spectra were analyzed using CasaXPS software. The BET surface area
and BJH pore volume and size analysis were carried out in N2 atmosphere72 using Micromeritics-ASAP-2020
instrument. Hall effect measurements were carried out using Resi Test
8400 Hall effect measurement analyzer by employing a dc Hall effect
measurement method. The electrochemical performance of the electrode
material was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry
techniques on BioLogic BCS810 electrochemical workstation.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical studies were carried out on two-electrode solid-state
system using a solid electrolyte PVA/H2SO4.
Initially, the solid electrolyte was prepared using polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA) and H2SO4. For this purpose, 1 g of PVA
was added slowly in 10 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring
at 80 °C. Once the homogeneous and clear mixture forms, conc.
H2SO4 (1 g) was added and stirring was continued
to obtain the clear solution. The slurry was prepared by uniformly
mixing the active material (75%), conducting graphite (15%), and polyvinylidene
fluoride (10%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Next, electrodes
were prepared by coating the slurry on copper foil using the doctor
blade technique. After coating, electrodes were dried at 120 °C
in a vacuum oven for 8 h. The all solid-state supercapacitor cells
were assembled from two pieces of electrodes separated by a filter
paper and a solid electrolyte.
