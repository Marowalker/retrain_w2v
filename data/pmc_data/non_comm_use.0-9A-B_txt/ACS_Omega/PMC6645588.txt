A tris(2-aminoethyl)-amine-based
dimeric capsular assembly of pentafluorophenyl
urea (C1) has been employed as a catalyst in a wide range
of Michael addition reactions. This capsular catalyst assembly dramatically
accelerates the Michael addition reaction of β-nitrostyrenes
(2a–2d) with various Michael donors such as ketoesters
(3a, 3e), 1,3-diketones (3b), diesters (3C), and cyanoesters (3d) at room temperature
to yield the corresponding nitroalkanes in significantly high yields
within a very short reaction time. Significant improvement in solubility
and use of conventional organic solvents in reaction along with a
drastic decrease in reaction time (high value of the rate constant
of the reaction) has been achieved through C1 as compared
to the previously reported homologous tripodal monomeric urea catalyst
(L1). The addition of enolate to β-nitrostyrenes
to generate an anionic intermediate seemed to be highly stabilized
by the six urea units of capsular assembly. Control experiments and
in situ kinetic studies are performed for this addition reaction and
based on the results, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for
the formation of Michael adduct inside the capsular cavity.

1 Introduction
Development
of new and efficient reaction pathways through the
assistance of organocatalysis is a rapidly emerging and dynamic area
of research in current chemical science.1 Organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful and environment-friendly
technique for a variety of fundamentally important transformations
and preparation of optically pure organic compounds of potential importance.1d,2 Among all the oraganocatalytic techniques, conjugate Michael addition
reaction for C–C bond formation is one of the most powerful
techniques for construction of functionalized and enantiorich carbon
skeletons for the synthesis of biologically active compounds.3 In this regard, conjugate Michael addition reaction
to nitro-olefins is also very attractive as the resulting nitroalkane
can be converted into several other important functional groups of
potential importance.4 For this purpose,
numerous strategies such as Brønsted acid–base interactions,5 π-stacking interactions,6 enamine or iminium catalysis,7 hydrogen bonding interaction through urea or thiourea,8 ion-pair interactions by phase transfer catalysts,9 and cage complexes10 are among the organocatalytic strategies that have been widely utilized.11 Several functional groups such as functionalized
proline,12 substituted amines,13 and squaramides14 were utilized for this purpose. However, organocatalytic Michael
addition reactions with cage complexes/capsular assemblies are very
rare in the literature.10d,15 Because of the formation
of a suitable microenvironment inside the cavity, organic transformations
inside cage/capsular assemblies are very fascinating, and they come
up with exciting and unprecedented results.

Several monopodal,
bipodal amine-urea/thiourea-based dual receptors
have been utilized for achiral/asymmetric versions of Michael addition
reactions.16 Previously, we reported the
first example of a tripodal, monomeric bifunctional tris(2-aminoethyl)-amine-based
tripodal pentafluorophenyl urea catalyst (L1, Scheme 1) for efficient Michael
addition reactions along with its detailed mechanistic investigations.8e However, because of the limited solubility of
the catalyst in common organic solvents, we could only carry out the
reaction in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a reaction time of 5–6
h. In order to overcome this limitation of solubility and to reduce
the reaction time, we have tried to modify the urea moiety with various
substituents. However, all our attempts failed to improve its solubility
in common organic solvents. Then, we turned our attention toward the
use of dimeric capsular assembly as catalyst to improve the catalyst
solubility and introduce other assistances such as the use of a suitable
microenvironment, utilization of a greater number of urea units in
reaction, and so on. The capsular assembly was prepared by treating
the monomer with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) in DMSO in open
atmosphere (Scheme 1). After 1 or 2 days, crystals of carbonate-encapsulated dimeric
assembly were obtained on the liquid–air interface (for details,
see the Experimental Section & ref (17)).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation
of the Formation of Dimeric Carbonate Capsular
Assembly, C1, from Monomeric Tripodal Urea, L1, and Their Use as Catalysts in Michael Addition Reactions of Activated
Nucleophiles with Various β-Nitrostyrenes
The dimeric capsular assembly had two preliminary
advantages over
its monomer, viz. (i) drastic improvement in solubility is observed
(soluble in almost all common organic solvents), which assisted in
more convenient reaction and work-up procedures and (ii) capsular
cavity is created with basic carbonate anion and six acidic urea units
within the capsular cavity, which might assist facile Michael addition
reactions via formation of a suitable microenvironment. In order to
serve our purpose, we have synthesized a dimeric hexaurea capsular
assembly, C1, (TBA)2[CO3⊂(L1)2] from its monomer, L1, as described previously and shown
in Scheme 1. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report of catalytic
Michael addition reaction by a purely organic capsular assembly.

2 Results and Discussion
All the optimization studies
were carried out by a model Michael
addition reaction between β-nitrostyrene, 2a, and
three equivalents of ethyl acetoacetate, 3a. The solvent
dependence of the catalytic activities of the catalyst has been studied
with different solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran
(THF), methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile (CH3CN), water (H2O), DMSO, and toluene at room temperature. All the reactions
were carried out under similar experimental conditions. Among all
the solvents, we observed the maximum catalytic activity of the catalyst
in DCM and toluene (Table 1). It is noteworthy to mention here that we have removed the
limitation of using conventional organic solvents as opposed to our
previous report with L1 where the catalysis could only
be performed in DMSO. C1 showed an almost similar catalytic
activity in DMSO, DCM, THF, and toluene where the reaction was completed
within only 5 min. However, in the case of polar protic solvents such
as MeOH and H2O, the reactions took a much longer time
with a lower yield of product (Table 1). Because of the convenience of using DCM as the solvent
as compared to DMSO, toluene, and THF, we have performed all our catalytic
reactions in DCM.

After successful optimization of the solvent, we optimized
the
catalyst loading of the receptor by scanning the catalyst loading
from 10 to 1 mol % (Table 2). Data in Table 2 clearly show that the catalyst is capable of carrying out
the reaction efficiently with catalyst loading as low as 1 mol % within
only 5 min without any significant decrease in the yield of the product
(Figure 1, Table 2). In case of our
previous report, we could reach the minimum catalyst loading of 2
mol % with a reaction time of 5–6 h.8e Thus, by using this dimeric capsular assembly, we have reduced the
catalyst loading, and also a drastic improvement in reaction time
has been achieved.

2.1 Michael Reaction with Ketoester and 1,3-Dicarbonyl
Compounds
The dimeric capsular assembly C1 has
been examined as a catalyst for reaction of various substituted and
unsubstituted β-nitrostyrenes (2a–2d) with
different Michael donors in DCM at room temperature. All the 15 reactions
in these series progressed smoothly with good yields of final products
(85–97% yield, Table 3). It can be clearly observed from Table 3 that substitution on the phenyl ring of
the electrophilic β-nitrostyrenes does not have any significant
effect on the overall yield of the product. The reactivity rates of
all the β-nitrostyrenes were almost same at room temperature
(with 1 mol % catalyst loading and 3 equiv Michael donor) irrespective
of the nature of electronic effect on the phenyl ring. However, at
a lower temperature, we could differentiate the Michael acceptors
based on their electrophilic nature. Primarily, the reactions of ethyl
acetoacetate, 3a, to all the β-nitrostyrenes (2a–2d) were investigated with 1 mol % C1 catalyst in DCM, which yielded the products (4a–4d) as diastereomeric mixtures in high yields (93–97% yield, Table 3). Then, under similar
experimental conditions, the reactions between β-nitrostyrenes
(2a–2d) and acetyl acetones (3b)
were carried out. Interestingly, only unsubstituted and p-OCH3-substituted β-nitrostyrenes yielded the desired
products (5a, 5c) in good yield (88 and
85%, respectively, Table 3), whereas the other two substrates did not form any products
as observed from thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Further, diethyl
malonate (3c) was also employed as a Michael donor toward
the above series of Michael acceptors (2a–2d).
It was noticed that only p-CH3- and p-OCH3-substituted β-nitrostyrenes formed
the desired Michael addition products (6b, 6c) in good yields (92 and 90%, respectively, Table 3). Finally, the cyclic ketoester Michael
donor, 3e, was employed in addition reaction with all
the previously mentioned β-nitrostyrenes, which yielded all
the four desired products (8a–8d) in significantly
good yields. It is noteworthy to mention here that all the above reactions
were completed within only 5 min with 3 equiv donors and 1 mol % catalyst
loading.

Styrenes with Cyanoester, Ketoester, and 1,3-Dicarbonyl Compoundsa

2.2 Michael
Reaction with Other Michael Donors
Further, Michael addition
reactions of different β-nitrostyrenes
(2a–2d) with different types of Michael donor
substrates, viz. cyano ethylacetate, 3d, and malononitrile,
were carried out under similar experimental conditions as mentioned
previously. It is noteworthy to mention that C1 showed
a similar catalytic and kinetic efficiency as shown previously during
reaction with 1,3-di carbonyl compounds. 3d reacted with 2b, 2c, and 2d to give the desired
products (7b, 7c, and 7d) in
84, 85, and 87% yields, respectively (Table 3), within 5 min with 3 equiv Michael donor
and 1 mol % catalyst loading. Interestingly, in all cases, the diastereomeric
ratio was found to be 1:1 irrespective of the substituents on the
phenyl ring of the Michael acceptors. However, we did not see the
formation of our desired products when malononitrile was employed
as Michael donor. Probably, in the presence of the highly basic carbonate
group, the malononitrile gets
decomposed. After performing Michael addition reactions of various
Michael donors with different β-nitrostyrenes, in order to investigate
the mechanism of the Michael addition reactions, we carried out several
kinetic studies based on 1H NMR experiments. These studies
were performed by monitoring the formation of the product via 1H NMR, with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as the internal reference.
Initially, when a reaction is carried out between 2a and
excess of ethyl acetoacetate, 3a, with 1 mol % C1 catalyst at room temperature, the reaction was completed
within such a short time (within 5 min) that it could not be monitored
stepwise by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Thus, in order to slow
down the rate of the reaction (so that some valuable data can be obtained
within the NMR time scale), we have performed the reaction by decreasing
the temperature of reaction to 0 °C. Then, we were able to record
some kinetic data for the reaction where the concentration of starting
styrene decreases progressively with time (Figure 2). A plot of log(C0/Ct) versus time from
the abovementioned reaction yielded a perfectly fitted straight line
according to the equation log(C0/Ct) = K × t (where C0 is the initial conc.
of styrene, Ct is the
conc. of styrene at time, t, and K is the rate constant of the reaction). The linear fitting of the
data points clearly indicated that the reaction is pseudo-first-order
wrt 2a with a rate constant value of 1.1 × 10–1 min–1 (Figure 3). It is noteworthy to mention here that
this rate constant value is about 70 times higher than the pseudo-first-order
rate constant value reported for L1 for the same reaction
in DMSO.8e Similarly, the reactions between 2b, 2c, and 2d with excess ethyl
acetoacetate resulted in a steady decrease in concentration of starting
styrene at 0 °C (Figures S1, S3, and S5), and the
plot of log(C0/Ct) versus time yielded a straight line, which
indicated all the reactions to be pseudo-first-order wrt 2b, 2c, and 2d (Figures S2, S4, and S6). Fitting of all the above data yielded rate constant values
of 9.8 × 10–2, 7.8 × 10–2, and 1.3 × 10–1 min–1 for 2b, 2c, and 2d, respectively (Figures S2, S4, and S6, Table 4), with increment factors of 98, 82, and 52 times, respectively,
as compared to rate constant values reported for L1 in
DMSO.8e Similarly, the reaction is found
to be pseudo-first-order wrt EAA when a large excess of 2a was used as reactant (Figure S7).

After
evaluation of the rate constant of the reactions with several
Michael acceptors, we evaluated the Hammett reaction constant (ρ)
for determination of extent of electronic perturbation in the transition
state of the reaction. The effect of different substituents on the
reaction kinetics is generally derived from the Hammett linear free
energy relationship, which is formulated as log(kR/kH) = ρσ, where
(kR/kH) is
the relative rate constant value for R-substituted β-nitrostyrene
as compared to unsubstituted β-nitrostyrene and σ is known
as the substituent constant. Thus, a plot of log(kR/kH) versus σ yields
a straight line with a slope of ρ, which is the measure of the
sensitivity of a reaction upon electronic perturbation because of
the substituent effect. The parameter, ρ, determines the relative
susceptibility of a reaction to the nature of substituent (electron-donating
or electron-withdrawing). In our present Michael addition reaction,
we have undertaken a Hammett study to investigate the influence of
substituents on the phenyl ring of nitrostyrene, on the Michael addition
reactions. A plot of relative rate constant (kR/kH) versus substituent constant,
σ, resulted in a linear fit of the data points with positive
Hammett reaction constant ρ-value of 0.4 (Figure 4), which indicated that the reaction proceeded
through a nucleophilic mechanism. A positive ρ value suggests
that the nucleophilic attack of enolate on the nitrostyrene produces
an anionic intermediate which is likely to be stabilized by H-bonding
interaction with the urea moiety.

Figure 4 Hammett plot of the Michael reaction of
p-substituted β-nitrostyrene
with 3a.

In order to investigate the role of the capsular cavity in
the
course of the reaction, we have performed some controlled reactions
where at first a combination of L1 and Na2CO3 (as 10 mol % catalyst) was used as a catalyst. This
catalyst was used in the Michael addition reaction between β-nitrostyrene
(2a) with three equivalents of ethyl acetoacetate (3a) in DCM at room temperature. Interestingly, TLC showed
a very small amount of conversion of reactant (β-nitrostyrene)
even after 2–3 h. In fact, the catalyst combination is not
at all soluble in DCM, which resulted in heterogeneous phase catalysis
(as opposed to C1 where the reaction medium was homogeneous)
that could not efficiently produce the desired Michael addition product.
This result indicated that the capsular cavity remained stable (if
the capsule were broken, the reaction medium would become heterogeneous
as monomeric L1 is insoluble in DCM) during the reaction
and assisted the reaction inside the cavity. In some cases, where
the desired Michael addition product was not obtained, we have actually
seen the formation of a precipitate, which could be due to the formation
of insoluble L1 from the decomposition of the capsular
assembly under the experimental condition. The 1H NMR spectrum
of the precipitated mass was almost similar to the 1H NMR
of pure L1 (Figure S8). This
result indicated that the precipitate was actually insoluble L1, which might have formed from the decomposition of C1. On the other hand, when a homogeneous combination of L1 and TBAHCO3 (as 10 mol % catalyst) in DCM was
used in the above Michael addition reaction, ≈30% yield of
the product was obtained after 1 h, which was much lower and slower
than that observed in case of C1. Similarly, when another
homogeneous combination of L1 and (TBA)2CO3 (prepared from an equimolar mixture of TBAHCO3 and TBAOH in DMSO and used as 10 mol % catalyst) in DMSO was used
in the above Michael addition reaction, ≈53% yield of the product
was obtained after 1 h, which was also much lower and slower than
that observed in case of C1. Thus, both the above model
experiments proved the significant role and necessity of capsular
cavity in the course of the reaction. Unfortunately, unlike our previous
report with L1,8e as we could
not prepare a similar model capsule without a bridgehead nitrogen
atom, we could not determine the role of the bridgehead nitrogen atom
in our present study. As the acidic urea peaks of C1 were
very broad and practically unrecognizable because of prior interaction
with CO32–, we could not determine the
nature of interaction of reactants/reaction intermediates with the
urea protons of C1 from 1H NMR. However, from
the previous results8e and general nature
of urea group toward anionic species, it is expected that the anionic
intermediate (formed after Michael addition) can be stabilized by
H-bonding interaction with urea moiety of L1. In order
to confirm that the capsular assembly remained stable throughout the
reaction, we performed diffusion-ordered spectroscopy-NMR experiment
of the pure capsular catalyst and catalyst solution after completion
of the reaction. All the diffusion coefficient data are provided in
the supporting information (Figures S9–S11). The diffusion coefficient value of the pure catalyst before the
reaction was 1.16 × 10–9 m2/s. After
completion of reaction, the diffusion coefficient values were 1.04
× 10–9 and 2.93 × 10–9 m2/s in DMSO-d6 and CDCl3, respectively. Thus, the diffusion coefficient values were
almost same in DMSO-d6 before and after
the reaction, which indicated that catalytic species were same before
and after the reaction. A nearly-three-times-higher diffusion coefficient
value of the catalyst in CDCl3 also refers to the same
catalytic species according to the Stokes Einstein equation (D ∝ 1/η for a molecule in different medium
where D is the diffusion coefficient of the species
and η is the viscosity coefficient of the medium) as DMSO-d6 has a nearly-three-times-higher η value
as compared to CDCl3. As the catalyst is known to form
a 1:2 (H/G) complex with CO32– in DMSO
solution,17 similar/complementary values
of diffusion coefficients of the catalyst in different medium after
the reaction indicated that the capsular assembly remained intact
throughout the reaction. As we did not have enough evidence of the
free pure capsular assembly, C1 in CDCl3,
we have taken parameters of free pure C1 in DMSO solvent
[where it is proved to exist as a 1:2 (H/G) complex] as an initial
reference for the existence of capsular assembly. One indirect evidence
was the homogeneous nature of the solution, which would have turned
heterogeneous if C1 decomposed to form L1, which is insoluble in DCM and CHCl3.

With all
the above experimental results, we have proposed a simplified
plausible mechanism (Figure 5). At first, the catalyst activates both electrophilic nitro-olefins
and nucleophilic ethyl acetoacetate via hydrogen bonding and deprotonation,
respectively, inside the capsular assembly (step 1, Figure 5). After that, the enolate
attacks the nitro-olefin to generate an intermediate, D (step 2, Figure 5), which probably gets stabilized by the surrounding six urea moieties
via formation of hydrogen bonding interaction, which minimizes the
activation energy of the reaction and thus accelerates the reaction.
The formation of an anionic intermediate is supported by the positive
ρ value of 0.4. This intermediate finally abstracts a proton
from HCO3– to form product 4a (step 3, Figure 5), which probably comes out from the capsule because of poor fitting
inside the capsule along with the regeneration of the capsular catalyst.

Figure 5 Proposed
mechanism for the present Michael addition reaction.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have synthesized and utilized the dimeric capsular
assembly of hexaurea for efficient and fast Michael addition reactions
between unsubstituted/substituted β-nitrostyrenes with several
activated Michael donors such as 1,3 diketone, ketoester, diester,
and cyanoester under ambient conditions to produce the Michael adduct
in excellent yields. The dimeric capsular assembly showed superior
catalytic efficiency in terms of decrease in catalyst loading, use
of conventional solvent, and drastic decrease in reaction time as
compared to its monomeric analogue, L1. We have shown
the role of dimeric capsular assembly in the reaction by performing
some model reactions and proposed a simple plausible mechanism for
the product formation from the kinetic studies. Utilization of this
type of purely organic capsular assembly in organocatalysis could
be very useful in development of cavity-based organocatalysis for
better efficiency and selectivity. We are currently focusing on the
detailed kinetic studies with other similar capsular catalysts, which
would be very useful to demonstrate the detailed mechanistic route
of this type of Michael addition reactions.

4.1 General Comments
A Bruker 300 MHz
NMR instrument was used to record all the spectra. Chemical shifts
were reported in parts per million from tetramethylsilane (TMS) with
the solvent resonance as the internal standard (CHCl3:
δ = 7.26 ppm). The pattern of reported data is as follows: chemical
shifts, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = double doublet,
t = triplet, q = quartet, br = broad, m = multiplet), integration,
and coupling constant (Hz). 13C NMR spectra were recorded
at 75 MHz with proton decoupling. Chemical shifts were reported in
parts per million from TMS with the solvent resonance as the internal
standard (CHCl3: δ 77.0 ppm). Chromatographic purifications
were done with either a 60–120 or a 100–200 mesh silica
gel. For reaction monitoring, precoated silica gel 60 F254 TLC sheets
were used. DCM was dried with CaH2 and used for all the

was monitored by TLC, which suggested the completion of almost all
the reactions within 5 min. After completion of the reaction, the
solution was extracted 2–3 times with water. After that, the
organic layer was separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,
and then concentrated under vacuum. The obtained residue was purified
by column chromatography on a silica gel (60–120 mesh, ethyl

monitored by analysis of 1H NMR of each NMR tube after
different increasing time intervals by integration with respect to
the internal standard. Fitting of data for plot of log(C0/Ct) versus
time gives the order of reaction wrt 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d. Fitting of data for plot of log(C0/Ct) versus time yielded a straight line from where the rate constant

the progress of the reaction from time to time. Proceeding of the
addition reaction was monitored by analysis of 1H NMR of
each NMR tube after different increasing time intervals by integration
