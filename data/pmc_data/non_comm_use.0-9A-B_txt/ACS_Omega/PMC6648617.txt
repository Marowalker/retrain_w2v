Seven
supramolecular compounds comprising multivalent imidazolium
macrocycles and metal halides, {[MC-IM][Ag2I4]}n (1), {[PC-IM]2[Ag7I11]}n (2), {[ODC-IM][Ag3I7]} (3), {[ODC-IM][Bi2I10]} (4), {[MDC-IM][Bi2I10]} (5), {[PDC-IM][Bi2I10]} (6), and {[MDC-IM][HgI4]}
(7), have been synthesized by solvothermal reactions
and structurally characterized by IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Notably, the three
tetravalent imidazolium macrocycles were introduced for the first
time and the extended anion structures are featured with three-dimensional
coordination networks, one-dimensional chains, or zero-dimensional
oligomers. This new study attempts to not only fill the gap in this
supramolecular hybrid area that has been neglected but also enrich
the type of imidazolium cyclophane. It is important that good efforts
were devoted to study the adsorption properties of supramolecular
compounds. Compound 5 exhibited great adsorption performance
for organic dyes methylene blue, methyl orange, and rhodamine B (RhB)
and can be evaluated as a potential candidate for industrial wastewater
treatment.

Introduction
Over the past few decades,
much work has been done in developing
imidazolium cyclophane complexes and exploring their potential applications.
The properties of macrocyclic compounds mainly include host–guest
chemistry,1−3 self-assembly,4 selective
catalysis,5 and ion channel.6,7 In an earlier study, Thummel’s group prepared a series of
2,2′-bibenzimidazolium salts by N,N′-bridging using
dihaloalkanes.8 They found that these salts
may be reduced by one or two electrons to the corresponding cation
radical or neutral 2,2′-bibenzimidazolinylidene. Many studies
have shown that the hydrogen in 2-C in the imidazole ring is strongly
acidic. Under alkaline conditions, protons can be removed and coordinated
with metals to form carbene complexes. More research about this come
from Baker’s group.9−15 However, research on the use of imidazolium cyclophanes and metal
salts to construct a supramolecular system is rare. We concentrated
on the use of the imidazolium cation as the template because it has
a positive charge on its own.16−18

Nowadays, organic dyes
are closely related to our daily life, such
as for the dyeing of silk, cotton, linen, and orlon fibers, as well
as in the papermaking industry. Dyes that are electrically neutral,
positive, or negative are usually difficult to degrade. Therefore,
dyes must be removed before discharge. Recently, metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have been widely used in the domain of selective
adsorption and separation of dyes.19 Most
of them contain approximately sized channels. Many applications in
degradation of organic dyes by MOF have been explored, but supramolecular
compounds are rarely used to absorb or isolate dye molecules.20

It was rarely reported that imidazolium
cyclophanes as the cationic
template can be used to synthesize supramolecular compounds with metal
halides.21 In this contribution based on
two divalent imidazolium macrocycles (MC-IM·Br2 and
PC-IM·Br2) and three novel tetravalent imidazolium
macrocycles: di-orthocyclo{l,4}(1,3)imidazolophanium dibromide (abbreviated
as ODC-IM·Br4), di-metacyclo{l,4}(1,3)imidazolophanium
dibromide (abbreviated as MDC-IM·Br4), and di-paracyclo{l,4}(1,3)imidazolophanium
dibromide (abbreviated as PDC-IM·Br4) (shown in Scheme 1), we prepared seven
new inorganic–organic hybrid supramolecules {[MC-IM][Ag2I4]}n (1), {[PC-IM]2[Ag7I11]}n (2), {[ODC-IM][Ag3I7]} (3), {[ODC-IM][Bi2I10]} (4), {[MDC-IM][Bi2I10]} (5), {[PDC-IM][Bi2I10]} (6), and {[MDC-IM][HgI4]} (7). They not only
enrich the type of imidazole ring but also can be used for dye adsorption
research to achieve the purpose of purifying water.

Description
of Crystal Structures
Crystal Structure of {[MC-IM][Ag2I4]}n(1)
The asymmetric unit
of 1 consists of an electron-deficient meta-imidazole
ring [MC-IM]2+ and an anion [Ag2I4]2– (Figure 1a). There are two crystallographically independent Ag (I)
atoms, both of which are four-coordinated in similar coordination
environments. The anion [Ag2I4]n2– is partially polymerized into
a three-dimensional (3D) iodoargentate network structure (as shown
in Figure 1b). It can
be seen from the compound 1 packing diagram in Figure 1c that the imidazole
ring is interspersed in the 3D [Ag2I4]n2n– anionic
tunnel by electrostatic force. Figure 1d shows the crystal-stacked diagram of compound 1 viewed along the a-axis direction (like
bowls tied with a straw).

diagram of compound 1 in the a-axis
direction.

Crystal Structure of {[PC-IM]2[Ag7I11]}n(2)
Figure 2a shows that
the characteristic feature of compound 2 is the one-dimensional
(1D) iodoargentate chain and cation. Seven Ag atoms have different
coordination environments, which are coordinated with four I atoms;
there exists a metal–metal bond between Ag2–Ag3 and
Ag5–Ag6. A schematic of [Ag4I6]n2n– and [Ag3I5]n2n– anionic polymerization is shown in Figure 2b, where [Ag4I6]2– forms the cubic structure with the smallest
building unit hexahedron and [Ag3I5]2– forms the minimum structure unit of tetrahedron. The asymmetric
unit is connected by Ag–Ag bonds (the Ag–Ag bond length
of 2.942–3.283 Å is less than twice the van der Waals
radius of Ag 1.72 Å, which indicates the presence of Ag–Ag
metal bonds). By this connection, two different anion polymeric chains
are formed. Figure 2c shows the stacking of heterocyclic cation [PC-IM]2+ in
the b-axis direction, and the anion chains [Ag4I6]n2n– and [Ag3I5]n2n– are surrounded and
interacted with cations by electrostatic interaction. Viewed along
the b-direction, this iodoargentate chain looks like
a beautiful Chinese knot in Figure 2c.

structure

Crystal Structure of [ODC-IM][Ag3I7] (3)
Compound 3 was synthesized by the
solvothermal reaction from AgI, KI, and [ODC-IM]4+, at
a certain molar ratio. Its asymmetric unit in Figure 3a contains Ag (I) atoms with different coordination
environments. Each Ag adopts a four-coordination mode. Ag1 is not
only connected to Ag2 and Ag3 through μ2-I but also
coordinated with two t-I. Ag3 interacted with Ag2 to form Ag–Ag
metal bonds and also coordinated with a t-I and three μ2-I. The Ag–I bond lengths ranged from 2.7310 to 3.1176
Å, and the I–Ag–I bond angles ranged from 55.00
to 131.82°. Figure 3b,c shows the stacked view of compound 3 under different
visions. The anion-building unit Ag3I7 is located
in the middle of two cationic [ODC-IM]4+ macrocycles interacted
via the electrostatic force forming a sandwichlike structure.

unit of compound 3; (b) anion structure

direction; and (c) stacked diagram of compound 3 in the a-axis direction.

Crystal Structures of [ODC-IM][Bi2I10] (4), [MDC-IM][Bi2I10] (5), and [PDC-IM][Bi2I10] (6)
The structures of compounds 4–6 are
featured by the binuclear iodobismuthates. Their crystal structures
are very similar (except for some differences in the stacked patterns),
and they are three isomers. Therefore, the structure of compound 4 is taken as an example here for a detailed description.
The asymmetric unit of compound 4 contains 1/2 [ODC-IM]4+, a positive Bi atom, and five negative I atoms (Figure 4a). As is shown in Figure 4b, in isomorphic
compounds 4–6, Bi(1) and Bi(2) atoms
are bonded to four t-I and μ2-I (the Bi atoms are
coplanar with μ2-I, and the plane is named β-plane).
It can be seen from Figure 4c that the inorganic moiety [Bi2I10]4– is in the middle of the two cationic [ODC-IM]4+ macrocycles. The anion and cation form a sandwichlike structure
and construct a unit model (abstracted in Figure 4d) by electrostatic force and weak C–H···I
bonds (where the bond length of C–H···I in [ODC-IM]4+ is around 3.2 Å, the bond length of C–H···I
in [MDC-IM]4+ is around 3.01 Å, and C–H···I
of [PDC-IM]4+ is about 3.03 Å). Figure 4e shows a stacked view of compounds 4–6. It can be seen from the stacking
diagram that induced by different macrocyclic cations the [Bi2I10]4– anions are arranged along
a different direction. Taking the β-plane as a reference, there
existed an angle between the β-plane and the [ODC-IM]4+ macrocyclic plane in compound 4, while it is substantially
parallel to the macrocyclic cation plane of [MDC-IM]4+ and
[PDC-IM]4+ in compounds 5 and 6, respectively. The phenomenon is probably caused by the presence
of different C–H···I bonds.

β-face of compound 4; (c) hydrogen bond diagram
(blue dash lines) of compound 4; (d) model diagram of
compounds 4–6; and (e) stacked diagram

Crystal Structure of {[MDC-IM][Hg2I8]} (7)
As shown in Figure 5a, its asymmetric unit consists
of two parts
of 1/2 [MDC-IM]4+ and a mononuclear [HgI4]2– anion. In the anion, the Hg atom adopted a tetracoordinate
mode bonded to four I atoms. The bond lengths of the Hg–I bond
are between 2.7675 (12) and 2.8416 (12) Å. The bond angles of
I–Hg–I are between 102.59 (4) and 113.28 (4)°. Figure 5b shows the spatial
arrangement between anions and cations, and Figure 5c shows the sandwichlike packing unit.

unit of compound 7; (b) stacked diagram

Single-crystal X-ray analysis
reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in a monoclinic
system with space group P212121, compounds 2 and 7 crystallize
in a monoclinic system with space
group P21/c, compounds 3–5 crystallize in a monoclinic system
with space group P1̅, and compound 6 crystallizes in a monoclinic system with space group P21/c. The anion structures of compounds 1–7 are featured by the 3D iodoargentate
network (for 1), 1D iodoargentate chain (for 2), trinuclear iodoargentate (for 3), binuclear iodobismuthates
(for 4–6), and mononuclear iodomercute
(for 7). The anion and organic cation interacted by electrostatic
interaction, van der Waals’ interaction, or hydrogen bond (Figures 1–5). As shown in Figures 1–5, the macrocycle
of the cation is larger and the anion structure of the supramolecule
is simpler. On the contrary, macrocycles of the cation are the smaller,
supramolecular anion structures, which are easily polymerized.22

Thermal Stability of Compounds 1–7
We studied the thermal stability
of compounds 1–7 through the NETZSCH
STA 449C synchronous thermal
analyzer (Figure S6). The experimental
conditions were as follows: N2 gas atmosphere (gas flow
rate 30 cm3 min–1), heating rate was
5 K min–1, experimental temperature is from 25 to
800 °C. The weight loss curve of the compounds can be clearly
observed from the thermogravimetric analysis chart in Figure S6. The thermal stability of compounds 1 and 2 is similar, and the tendency of weight
loss of compounds 3–7 is similar.
They are stable below 320 °C. After 320 °C, the weight loss
of the sample mainly consists of two stages. When the temperature
is 320–450 °C, it is mainly caused by the decomposition
of the cations. After 450 °C, the weight loss of the sample is
caused by the decomposition of the inorganic structure. As shown in Figure S6, seven compounds are stable up to the
temperature of around 300 °C. Therefore, the stabilities of compounds 1–7 are relatively good.

Adsorption
Properties of Compounds 1–7
To explore the ability that compounds 1–7 purify organic dyes in wastewater, we selected
three common dyes, methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), and rhodamine
B (RhB), to investigate the adsorption properties of compounds 1–7. The concentrations of MB, MO, and
RhB solutions (100 mL volumetric flask) were 1.0 × 10–5, 5.0 × 10–5, and 2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1. Taking the adsorption of MB by compound 1 as an example, the experiment process is as follows: take
20 mL of MB solutions in a dark place and then take about 3 mL of
the solution each time to measure its initial absorbance by ultraviolet
adsorption spectrum (MB, A0 at 663 nm).
Next, 10 mg of compound 1 was added to one of the MB
solutions, and the other was a blank control. They were measured during
the appropriate time interval. Figures S7–S13 show the adsorption of compounds 1–7 on MB, MO, and RhB and the UV spectra of their respective blank
controls. Taking Ct/C0 (Lambert Beer’s law At/A0 = Ct/C0) as the ordinate and the illumination time
as the abscissa, the relationships between the Ct/C0 of the adsorption of MB,
MO, and RhB and their respective experiments are shown in Figures 6–8 and S14–S17. As is shown in Figures 6–8, compound 5 shows
extraordinary adsorption capacity for organic dyes RhB and MB, which
is much better than that of some MOFs,23 and the adsorption effect can approach 100%.24 The adsorption effect of compounds 4 and 6 on MO is also relatively good. The adsorption of the MB,
MO, and RHB dyes by compounds 1–7 may be caused by the hydrogen bond, the electrostatic force, or
the van der Waals force between the solid surface and the dye. Compounds 4–6 exhibited different adsorption properties
for MO and MB, which may be attributed to the different adsorption
sites on the different macrocycles. There is a large amount of C–H···I
hydrogen bonds between the inorganic anion and the organic cation
in compounds 4–6. It can accelerate
dye adsorption.20 The content of the leaking
Ag+ ion after one cycle of adsorption was measured by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The residual organic matter
in the solution is digested by nitric acid.24b The content of Ag+ measured by ICP-MS is 4.67 ×
10–5 mol L–1. This result indicates
that the content of the leaking Ag+ ion after the first
cycle of adsorption is rather small and can be neglected. The color
changes of the adsorbed dye before and after the adsorption are provided
in Figures S7–S13.

One of the most important factors
affecting the availability of
dye adsorption in the industry is its recycling performance. In the
second recycling experiment, 4 and 5 could
be readily recovered from the catalytic system via centrifugation
and deionized water rinsing. Reuse of the catalyst was then investigated
(Figure S18). The second adsorption rates
of compound 5 for MB decreased by 15%. The second adsorption
rates of compounds 4 and 5 for MO decreased
by 10 and 4%. They also have an obvious adsorption effect.

We
explored the reason for the adsorption of MB, MO, and RhB in
aqueous solution by compounds 1–7. Taking compound 5 as an example, its specific surface
area and pore size distribution were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. As shown in Figure 9, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms
obtained from compound 5 conform to adsorption type II,
which reflects the typical physical adsorption process. BET data show
that the specific surface area of compound 5 is 8.4264
m2 g–1, the pore diameter is 3.986 nm,
and the N2 amount adsorbed is 1.936 cm3 g–1. This result indicated that compound 5 is a mesoporous material and the related process belongs to external
surface adsorption.25

Conclusions
In
this article, we successfully synthesized seven novel inorganic–organic
hybrid supramolecular polymers using an imidazole ring macrocyclic
divalent organic cation template, which consist of a three-dimensional
structure of compound 1, a one-dimensional structure
of compound 2, a trinuclear structure of compound 3, a binuclear structure of compounds 4–6, and a mononuclear structure of compound 7.
Three tetravalent cation imidazolium macrocycles that have not been
previously reported were successfully introduced. It is found that
the metal anions and the cation ligands mutually influence the final
extended structures. We have investigated the thermostability and
dye adsorption. The result indicated that compounds 4–6 can readily and quickly absorb MO and MB from
water. We will continue to explore these supramolecular compounds
for solving environmental pollution problems.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
The imidazolium cationic derivative
compounds MC-IM·Br2, PC-IM·Br2, ODC-IM·Br4, MDC-IM·Br4, and PDC-IM·Br4 were synthesized according to the reported synthetic method.26−28 MC-IM·Br2 or PC-IM·Br2 was synthesized
by mixing and refluxing 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)butane (5 mmol) and
α,α′-dibromo-o-xylene (or 1,4-dibromomethylbenzene,
5 mmol) in acetonitrile for 20 h. After the reaction is completed,
the mixture was filtered while hot, to yield a clear yellow filtrate.
The solvent was removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure to
yield a white solid.26 ODC-IM·Br4 (MDC-IM·Br4 or PDC-IM·Br4) was synthesized by 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)butane (380 mg, 2 mmol)
and 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene (1,3-bis(bromomethyl)benzene or 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene)
(264 mg, 2 mmol) dissolved in acetonitrile. The latter was slowly
added dropwise to a solution of 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-yl)butane under
magnetic stirring (with a feeding time of not less than 40 min). The
mixture was allowed to reflux for 20 h. After the reaction was completed,
the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a white solid.27,28 Other chemicals were of reagent grade and used without further purification.
