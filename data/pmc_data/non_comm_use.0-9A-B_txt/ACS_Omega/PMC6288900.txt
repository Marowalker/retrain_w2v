Current
lye processing for debittering California black table olives
produces large amounts of caustic wastewater and destroys many of
the beneficial phenolic compounds in the fruit. Herein, we propose
using enzyme treatment in place of lye, potentially reducing the amount
and causticity of wastewater produced. By specifically targeting the
bitterness-causing compound, oleuropein, retention of other beneficial
phenolics may be possible. A β-glucosidase from Streptomyces sp. was identified from a screen of
22 glycosyl hydrolases to completely degrade oleuropein in 24 h. Computational
modeling was performed on this enzyme, and mutation C181A was found
to improve the rate of catalysis by 3.2-fold. This mutant was tested
in the context of the olive fruit and leaf extract. Degradation was
observed in the olive leaf extract but not in the fruit matrix, suggesting
that enzyme fruit penetration is a limiting factor. This work discovers
and begins the refinement process for an enzyme that has the catalytic
properties for debittering olives and provides direction for future
engineering efforts required to make a product with commercial value.

Introduction
There is a need to
replace the lye-curing method used by the California
table olive industry to debitter olives. The current process involves
multiple cycles of lye treatments and water rinses, which generates
large quantities of caustic wastewater. A life cycle assessment performed
for a three-step process estimated that 580–660 kg of wastewater
is produced per 100 kg olives.1,2 The wastewater has a
high pH (9.0–12.0), a high chemical oxygen demand (1500–3800
mgO2/L), and a high biological oxygen demand (390–1150
mgO2/L), which makes mitigation difficult and expensive
for processors.3 Additionally, California-style
processing removes many phenolic compounds from the olive fruit, which
reduces potential health benefits of the finished product.4,5 Replacing lye-curing with a more efficient and targeted method could
potentially relieve these problems.6

The secoiridoid oleuropein is primarily responsible for bitterness
in olives.7 Selective degradation of oleuropein
using an enzyme would accomplish the goal of debittering the olive
while retaining the nutritional content of the fruit. Furthermore,
an enzyme that is highly active against oleuropein could shorten processing
time and reduce the amount and causticity of wastewater produced.
Endogenous olive β-glucosidases and esterases contained in the
fruit are known to degrade oleuropein during ripening, storage, or
when the fruit is damaged.8−10 The purported reactions that
take place are shown in Scheme 1 (could occur in either order), wherein a β-glucosidase
cleaves the sugar moiety, resulting in oleuropein aglycone and glucose;
oleuropein aglycone is hydrolyzed to nonbitter elenolic acid and hydroxytyrosol
via esterase cleavage.11−13 We hypothesized that introducing one or both of these
enzymes during olive processing (see Figure S1) in the place of lye could degrade oleuropein specifically, while
retaining other phenolics in the fruit that would otherwise be destroyed.

Scheme 1 Oleuropein is Converted to the Nonbitter Glucose, Elenolic Acid,
and Hydroxytyrosol via Endogenous β-Glucosidases and Esterases
It has been reported that the
ester hydrolysis can also occur spontaneously.18

Involving enzymes in olive debittering
is not a novel idea and
has been previously considered. Select Lactobacillus
plantarum strains produce β-glucosidases with
activity toward oleuropein, and these organisms have been shown to
accelerate debittering of olives during fermentation.14,15 It was also found that adding a commercial β-glucosidase during
fermentation with L. plantarum yielded
slightly lower levels of oleuropein after 90 days compared with fermentation
alone.16 However, debittering olives via
fermentation can take several weeks to months and fermented olives
have a different sensory profile than California-style olives. De
Leonardis et al. found that treating olives with crude olive leaf
protein extract (which exhibited β-glucosidase activity) resulted
in faster oleuropein degradation than fermentation with L. plantarum, and an 87% reduction in oleuropein
was achieved after 30 days.17 Unfortunately,
this method exceeds the current processing time of California-style
olives and oleuropein degradation was incomplete. In addition to looking
for oleuropein degradation activity under olive storage conditions,
in vitro characterization of enzymes has been explored as well. For
example, a recombinant β-glucosidase from the organism Sulfolobus solfataricus, which has wide substrate
specificity, was immobilized onto a chitosan matrix and used to convert
commercially purchased oleuropein into hydroxytyrosol.18 Furthermore, degradation activity of a β-glucosidase
extracted from almonds has also been reported.19,20 However, the utility of these methods for removing oleuropein in
an actual olive fruit was not tested.

It is clear from previous
research that naturally occurring β-glucosidases
can degrade oleuropein and debitter olives. However, enzyme discovery
and design efforts are yet to be conducted to discover and optimize
an enzyme for this commercial activity. Here, we utilize a combination
of genomic mining and computational protein design to identify leads
and initiate efforts toward engineering an enzyme for this application.
Specifically, we identify an enzyme capable of complete degradation
of oleuropein to its nonbitter components and perform computationally
guided engineering to improve the turnover rate. This enzyme is also
tested in the context of the olive fruit and against olive leaf extract
herein to define current limitations and provide direction for future
engineering efforts.

Results and Discussion
Inspired
by the natural degradation pathway, we chose to select
a panel of enzymes from the β-glucosidase enzyme class (EC 3.2.1.21)
for initial oleuropein degradation screening. The chemistry performed
by this EC consists of cleavage of a terminal, nonreducing, β-d-glucosyl residue with the release of β-d-glucose
from a wide variety β-d-glucosides21 (i.e. oleuropein). Twenty-two β-glucosidases were
chosen from a pool of 170 family 1 glycosyl hydrolases (GH1s; all
sequences contained in the Supporting Information) gifted by the Joint Genome Institute (with 2 genes constructed
in-house; GH1s are characterized based on their canonical eight-fold
α/β barrel motif).22 This panel
was chosen based on β-glucosidase activity on cellobiose and
soluble expression levels in Escherichia coli according to experimental data provided by JGI.22Figure 1 depicts the phylogenetic tree that was built based on sequence similarity
containing all 170 GH1s in the pool. β-Glucosidases that were
tested are indicated on the tree and have an average pairwise sequence
identity of 32%. Activity was analyzed by monitoring hydroxytyrosol
formation by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; μM
hydroxytyrosol formation in 24 h) and is shown on the tree (green
bar graph). Eight enzymes (starred on the tree and have a pairwise
sequence identity of 41%) were found to degrade oleuropein to hydroxytyrosol
in significant amounts (>200 μM hydroxytyrosol formation)
after
a 24 h, room temperature incubation. The oleuropein aglycone, formed
in situ following glycosyl cleavage, spontaneously degrades to hydroxytyrosol
without the need of further treatment with an esterase. This instability
of oleuropein aglycone and rapid conversion to hydroxytyrosol has
been observed in other work.18

tree based on sequence similarity of 170 GH1s. Expression
level and cellobiose activity are indicated (salmon heat map and blue
binary, respectively). Absence of color in the expression field indicates
in-house gene construction and expression (data contained in the Supporting Information). The 22 GH1s tested (black
dot) are shown along with activity (green bar graph in μM hydroxytyrosol
produced at 24 h). The eight β-glucosidases showing significant
activity are starred (forming >200 μM hydroxytyrosol after
a
24 h incubation at room temperature).

Following the initial screening, a time-point study of these
eight
candidates was conducted in order to identify the enzymes that produced
hydroxytyrosol from oleuropein at a relatively faster rate. Figure 2 shows the rate of
hydroxytyrosol formation for each selected candidate (indicated as
the protein number and PDB code if available). It is also important
to note that hydroxytyrosol, once cleaved from oleuropein, degrades
over time, most likely due to oxidation and further dimerization of
the catechol moiety via an o-quinone intermediate.23 On the basis of this time-point study and availability
of structural data to simplify the modeling process, β-glucosidase
from Streptomyces sp.24 (JGI 4) was chosen as the starting point for engineering
(PDB accession code: 1GNX, uniprotKB AC: Q59976), which degraded 84% of oleuropein in 24 h.

Figure 2 Activity of
eight best candidates (protein number) displayed as
the rate of hydroxytyrosol formation (μM/h; enzyme concentrations
were normalized to 0.1 mg/mL; error bars represent standard deviation
with n = 3; PDB accession codes are indicated if
structural information is available).

Following this lead candidate, computational modeling was
performed
using the Rosetta molecular modeling suite to guide our engineering
efforts to enhance activity of this enzyme. The catalytic triad of 1GNX was identified by
aligning the crystal structure with another β-glucosidase, PDB 2JIE (BglB), which is
in complex with a covalently bound inhibitor (2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-glucopyranose) and has catalytic residues elucidated.25 The oleuropein ligand was constrained in the
active site according to known β-glucosidase chemistry. The
purported catalytic mechanism performed on oleuropein is shown in Figure 3a and is initiated
as GLU353 nucleophilically attacks the anomeric carbon of the β-d-glucosyl residue, displacing the oleuropein aglycone in an
SN2 fashion. GLU164 works as an acid/base conduit, protonating
the leaving group (oleuropein aglycone) and subsequently deprotonating
a water molecule, creating a hydroxide nucleophile that displaces
GLU353 and releases β-d-glucose with retention of stereochemistry.
TYR295 orients the nucleophilic GLU353 to preorganize the active site
for attack.25 Conformers of oleuropein,
containing a transition state-like geometry at the anomeric carbon
of the initial SN2 attack, were built and minimized using
Spartan.26 This conformational library
was then used in a Rosetta docking and design protocol with functional
constraints for the enzyme defined.27 The
electrophilic carbon was constrained as the center of a trigonal bipyramidal
geometry, wherein the attacking and leaving group oxygen atoms would
be placed at the two apexes, giving an angle between these three atoms
of 180° (Onucleophile–Celectrophile–Oleaving: 180°).28 The constraints were further defined to include distances, angles,
and dihedrals between the catalytic residues and the oleuropein substrate
and also between catalytic residues in an intramolecular fashion (detailed
constraint and modeling files are included in the Supporting Information). Figure 3b illustrates an example of a low-energy
docking result of oleuropein in the active site with the functional
constraints implemented.

aglycone and β-d-glucose showing the catalytic roles

constraints implemented. The distances are shown in Å. Figure
generated using PyMol.

The results from the design protocol were filtered based
on the
total energy and constraint scores as calculated by Rosetta. The top
20 designs with the lowest Rosetta energy and constraint scores were
visually inspected in order to revert mutations that did not appear
to be chemically sound (i.e. those that did not seem to improve hydrophobic,
electrostatic, or hydrogen bonding interactions or remove steric clashing).
Eleven mutants (each with 1–2 mutations) were chosen, constructed,
and tested for oleuropein degradation activity using the HPLC assay
described in the Methods section. Figure 4a shows the activity
of these mutants given as μM hydroxytyrosol formation after
2 h. Through this, one mutant showed enhanced activity, degrading
roughly 2.5-fold more oleuropein than the native enzyme [wild type
(WT)]. This new enzyme has one cysteine to alanine mutation at amino
acid position 181 and is depicted in Figure 4c in comparison to the WT (4b). This mutation from cysteine to alanine results in decreased
system energy of 1 Rosetta energy unit, predicted to be primarily
from relieving steric hindrance between the protein and ligand. A
Michaelis–Menten kinetic analysis was performed on both the
WT and the C181A mutant, and the resulting constants are shown in Figure 4d.

Figure 4 (a) Mutant activity given
as μM hydroxytyrosol formation
after 2 h with 5 mM oleuropein substrate (experiment performed once; n = 1). Enzyme concentrations were normalized to 0.1 mg/mL.
(b,c) Interaction of the oleuropein ligand with WT vs C181A, respectively,
showing relief of steric clashing (Rosetta residue scores indicated
with a lower score representing lower energy). (d) Enzyme kinetic
constants, including kcat, Km, and kcat/Km, comparing the WT and the C181A mutant.

Interestingly, while kcat was improved
by 3.2-fold with the mutant, the pseudobinding constant, Km, increased by 4.6-fold, which results in an overall
decrease in catalytic efficiency. The Km value is quite comparable to a literature value of 7.9 mM for this
enzyme on cellobiose.24 Although kcat was not reported, an activity of 0.6 μmol
min–1 mg–1 is listed,24 which is less than the calculated activity,
2.5 μmol min–1 mg–1, of
the engineered enzyme on oleuropein under similar conditions. However,
there is room for improvement on catalytic efficiency through further
iterations of computational engineering, given that the average efficiency
of enzymes are often on the order of 103 to 105 M–1 s–1.29

Following these specific and kinetic activity analyses,
mutant
C181A was chosen to be our best candidate for assessing oleuropein
degradation activity in fresh olives and olive leaf extract in order
to investigate how our enzyme performs within a fruit and vegetative
matrix. The enzyme was first tested at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL
in whole, pitted, and crushed olives. The olive fruit had an initial
oleuropein content of 2.02 ± 0.13 μmol/g (wet olive weight).
After 24 h of incubation, the concentration of oleuropein was not
significantly different between control and enzyme-treated samples
in any matrix (Figure 5a–c). Whole olives contained the highest amount of phenolics,
followed by pitted olives and finally crushed olives, which retained
almost nothing. Diffusion of phenolics from the fruit into solution
likely occurred at a higher rate as the surface area of the olive
increased. Phenolics may also have been degraded by endogenous enzymes
such as β-glucosidase, esterase, and polyphenol oxidase, which
activate when the drupe flesh is damaged.30

Figure 5 (a–c)
Concentrations of oleuropein and degradation products
in (a) whole olives (b) pitted olives and (c) crushed olives following
24 h of incubation with 0.1 mg/mL enzyme (candidate C181A). Concentrations
are expressed in μmol per gram of olive, wet weight. (d,e) Concentrations
of oleuropein and degradation products in (d) pitted olives and (e)
olive leaf extract following 24 h of incubation with 1.0 mg/mL enzyme
(candidate C181A). For pitted olives, concentrations are expressed
in μmol per gram of olive, wet weight. For olive leaf extract,
concentrations are expressed in μmol/mL of extract. Error bars
represent standard deviation with n = 3.

From this initial analysis, we hypothesized that
either the enzyme
was unable to diffuse into the olive flesh to degrade oleuropein or
other olive-related matrix components may be inhibitory. Therefore,
a second round of experiments was conducted to test these two hypotheses.
The first was increasing concentration of the enzyme by 10-fold, the
second was to compare pitted olives (maximizing flesh exposure while
not destroying the product) versus olive leaf extract which are high
in oleuropein.31 In the pitted olives,
there was again no significant difference in oleuropein between the
control and enzyme-treated samples (Figure 5d). However, in the olive leaf extract, the
enzyme yielded complete degradation of oleuropein and a significant
increase in hydroxytyrosol (Figure 5e). The molar amounts of oleuropein, oleuropein aglycone,
and hydroxytyrosol combined are equal in both samples. These results
further support that diffusion into the olive flesh is the limiting
factor for enzyme activity. It is hypothesized that oleuropein is
located within the vacuoles of olive plant cells32 and the β-glucosidase is likely not able to gain
contact with the oleuropein. In order to achieve debittering in the
short time frame necessary for California-style olives, further enzyme
optimization may be necessary to improve cell penetration. Addition
of cell-penetrating peptides to macromolecules, such as proteins,
has been shown to facilitate translocation across cell membranes in
plants. Specifically, cellular internalization of fluorescently labeled
pVEC and transportan has been reported in plant cells.33 Arginine-rich intracellular delivery peptide
has been shown to translocate fused fluorescent protein into plant
tissue of both tomatoes and onions.34 Pretreating
olives with heat or even a single lye rinse can disrupt the integrity
of cell walls and potentially improve enzyme diffusion as well.35,36

In its current form, the enzyme has potential applications
in olive
leaf tea, which is consumed in Mediterranean countries for its antioxidant,
antihypertensive, and antimicrobial health benefits.37 The tea is very bitter, and degradation of oleuropein may
increase palatability and widen the range of consumers. Additionally,
previous research showed that the olive leaf extract concentrated
in hydroxytyrosol had higher antiglycative and antioxidant activity
than the olive leaf extract concentrated in oleuropein.38 Therefore, increasing the hydroxytyrosol content
of olive leaf tea could potentially increase its health benefits.
Briante et al.39 explored using recombinant
β-glucosidase immobilized in a chitosan support to produce hydroxytyrosol
from olive leaf extract on an industrial scale. It is possible that
our engineered β-glucosidase could be similarly optimized for
commercial applications.

In conclusion, through genomic mining
of β-glucosidase sequence
space, a unique enzyme from Streptomyces sp. was discovered as being efficient at degrading the bitterness-causing
compound in olives, oleuropein. In addition, initial computational
protein design efforts to optimize activity have resulted in a mutant
with a 3.2-fold increase in the turnover rate. This engineered enzyme
was further tested in the context of the fruit and leaf extract matrix.
While degradation of oleuropein in the leaf extract was successful,
penetration of the enzyme into the fruit proved difficult and further
protein engineering is needed to overcome this issue.

Methods
Materials
Oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Purity was stated as ≥98%.
Manzanilla olives and olive leaves were hand-picked from the UC Davis
Orchard in November, 2016.

Phylogenetic Tree Generation
The
170 sequences (listed
in the Supporting Information Tables S1–S3)
were aligned with MUSCLE (default settings).40 The phylogenetic tree was built using the Geneious tree builder
with default settings. The resulting graphic was built and exported
from iTOL.41,42

Enzyme Modeling
Conformers of the oleuropein ligand
were built in Spartan and minimized using default settings.26 This ligand was built as a transition state-like
structure of the initial SN2 attack. Rosetta enzyme docking
and design protocols were run with default settings.27 An example of Rosetta enzyme design is provided in the
Rosetta molecular modeling suite demos. The oleuropein ligand was
constrained in the active site to the catalytic residues according
to previously reported chemistry.25 All
files used in modeling are contained in the Supporting Information (S1 code).

Mutagenesis, Protein Expression,
and Purification
The
plasmids encoding the 20 β-glucosidase enzymes tested were gifted
to us from the Joint Genome Institute. Two plasmids were constructed
in-house. For these, GeneArt custom gene fragments were ordered from
Life Technologies and codon optimized for E. coli. Isothermal Gibson assembly43 was used
to clone the strings into the pET-29b(+) vector (New England Biolabs,
Inc) at the NdeI and XhoI restriction cloning sites. Successful assembly
was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon). The mutant
plasmids were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis according
to the Kunkel protocol.44 Oligonucleotides
that were used in the Kunkel protocol were purchased from Eurofins
MWG Operon (Louisville, KY). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing
(Eurofins MWG Operon). The WT and mutant plasmids were transformed
into the BLR(DE3) strain of E. coli (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). 2 mL of terrific broth containing
50 μg/mL carbenicillin (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) was
inoculated with each transformant and was grown for 12 h at 37 °C
while shaking at 300 rpm. This 2 mL culture was then expanded to 500
mL (terrific broth with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin) and grown at
37 °C while shaking at 300 rpm until the optical density (OD)
reached 0.7–0.9 (OD determined by measuring absorbance at 600
nm). Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG Fisher
reagent) to induce protein expression was then added at a final concentration
of 1 mM. The cultures continued to grow for an additional 30 h at
18 °C while shaking at 300 rpm. At this point, the cultures were
centrifuged at 4700 rpm and the media decanted. The cell pellet was
resuspended in 30 mL 1× phosphate buffered saline (1× PBS)
with 30 mM imidazole at pH 7.4. To lyse the cells, the suspension
was sonicated on ice (with a Fisher Scientific model 705 sonic dismembrator)
for a total of 2 min:30 s at an amplitude of 30 and a 30 s break,
which is then repeated. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation
at 4700 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was passed over 1 mL of HisPur
Ni-NTA (nickel ion affinity) resin 50% slurry (Fisher Scientific)
in a gravity column. The resin was then washed with 10 mL of 1×
PBS with 30 mM imidazole six times. The protein was eluted with 10
mL 1× PBS with 200 mM imidazole into Corning Spin-X UF concentrators
with a 10 kD molecular weight cutoff. The concentrators were centrifuged
at 4700 rpm until the volume reached about 1 mL. Protein concentration
was detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm with a BioTek spectrophotometer.
Protein purity was assessed with a Coomassie stained sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (NuPAGE bis-tris, Fisher
Scientific) and assayed against oleuropein within three days of purification
(gel images contained in the Supporting Information Figures S2 and S4).

Assay Conditions and HPLC Method
Once the β-glucosidase
WT and mutant enzymes were produced and verified via gel electrophoresis,
the assay against oleuropein was performed. The enzymes were normalized
to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL by dilution with 1× PBS up to
95 μL. 100 mM oleuropein (5 μL) in dimethyl sulfoxide
was added to initiate the reaction (5 mM final concentration of oleuropein).
The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5–24 h
and quenched by the addition of 300 μL acetonitrile. The resulting
solutions were centrifuged at 15 000g for 30 min,
and the supernatant was pipetted away from the pelleted protein and
added to a HPLC vial. An Agilent 1100 series HPLC with variable wavelength
UV detection was used to detect hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, and intermediate
products of the reaction at 280 nm. A Phenomenex C18 column (specifications:
2.6 μm C18 100 Å, LC column 50 × 4.6 mm) was used
to separate these products with a gradient mobile phase of water (with
0.1% formic acid)/acetonitrile (with 0.1% acetic acid) over a 15 min
method (specifically: 0–4 min at 100% water phase; 4–10
min gradient increase of acetonitrile phase to 95%; 10–12 min
held at 95% acetonitrile phase; 12–15 min gradient decrease
of acetonitrile phase back to 0%).

Kinetic Analysis of the
WT and C181A Mutant
To obtain
steady-state kinetic data, the WT and C181A mutant were assayed against
varying concentrations of oleuropein (7, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0.75, 0.5, and
0.25 mM) at varying time points (1, 2, and 3 h). The concentration
of enzyme in all cases was normalized to 0.1 mg/mL (0.9 μM).
Reaction buffer, quenching procedure, and HPLC method were conducted
as outlined above. From this, kobs (μM
hydroxytyrosol min–1 [μM enzyme]−1) per concentration substrate was elucidated and fit to a Michaelis–Menten
kinetics curve using R computing software. Km and kcat were also calculated
in R using the Michaelis–Menten equation (all raw data, R scripts,
and curve fits are contained in the Supporting Information S2 code, Figures S3, S5, and S6).

Assessment
of Oleuropein Degradation in Olive Matrices
Enzyme candidate
C181A was tested in the olive fruit and olive leaf
extract to assess oleuropein degradation in the matrix. In the first
experiment, ten whole olives, ten hand-pitted olives, or ten olives
crushed in a food processor were soaked in 60 mL of 1× PBS. In
the treatment samples, enzyme candidate C181A was added to a final
concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Control samples received an equivalent
volume of elution buffer (1× PBS with 200 mM imidazole) without
enzyme. All conditions were prepared in triplicate. After 24 h of
incubation at room temperature, the fruit was drained. Oleuropein
and its degradation products were extracted from the olive fruit using
a previously described method45 and quantified
using LC–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS.

Analysis was performed
on a PerkinElmer Series 200 autosampler and quaternary pump (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to a SCIEX API 2000 triple-quadropole MS
system (SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) using negative electrospray ionization.
Separation of compounds was achieved using an Agilent C18 Eclipse
Plus column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The mobile phase was
60% water with formic acid (0.05%, v/v) and 40% methanol/acetonitrile
(50:50 v/v) with formic acid (0.05%, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min
through the column but was split before analysis, directing 400 μL/min
to the detector and 600 μL/min to waste. Total run time was
20 min. Focusing potential, ion spray voltage, entrance potential,
and ion spray temperature were −400, −4500, −10
V, and 400 °C, respectively. Curtain gas, ion source gas 1, ion
source gas 2, and collision gas were 50, 60, 40, and 6 psi, respectively.
Compounds were identified using multiple reaction monitoring with
the following conditions: oleuropein, transition of m/z 539 to m/z 377,
declustering potential (DP) of −32 V, collision energy (CE)
of −19 V, collision exit potential (CXP) of −11 V; oleuropein
aglycone, transition m/z 377 to m/z 307, DP of −20 V, CE of −20
V, CXP of −15 V; hydroxytyrosol, transition m/z 153 to m/z 123,
DP of −17 V, CE of −16 V, CXP of −7.5 V. Scan
time was 200 ms. Oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol were quantified using
six point calibration curves made from reference standards. Oleuropein
aglycone was quantified using the calibration curve for hydroxytyrosol
based on structural similarities.

The pitted olive trial was
repeated in a subsequent experiment
with the enzyme concentration at 1.0 mg/mL. This increased enzyme
concentration was also tested on olive leaf extract. To prepare the
olive leaf extract, 10 g of olive leaves were crushed in a food processor
and extracted with 100 mL of 70 °C water for 10 min. The extract
was cooled to room temperature and enzyme was added to a final concentration
of 1.0 mg/mL. Following 24 h of incubation at room temperature, oleuropein
and products were analyzed as previously described.

An independent t-test was performed using OriginPro
2016 b9.226 statistical software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton,
MA, USA) to determine if there was a difference in phenolics between
the control and enzyme samples. A p-value of 0.05
was considered significant and equal variance between populations
was assumed.
