As a new analytical technology, surface-enhanced Raman
scattering
(SERS) has received increasing attention, and researchers have discovered
the importance of SERS-active materials. Considerable effort has been
made by researchers to develop multiperformance and multipurpose SERS-active
substrates ranging from coinage metals to transition metals and semiconductor
materials. SERS-active substrates are critical for obtaining accurate
and reproducible spectral information. Among all the substrate materials,
semiconductors are considered one of the most promising materials,
as they exhibit high chemical stability, good biocompatibility, high
carrier mobility, and good controllability during fabrication. Here,
we provide an overview of SERS enhancement mechanisms based on semiconductor
materials, such as inorganic semiconductors, metal/semiconductor composites,
and organic semiconductors.

==== Body
Since surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) was discovered in 1974, it has been used in many
applications.1 This technique demonstrates
the idea that all research fields promote common developments. In
particular, the development of nanotechnology has invigorated the
development of SERS technology. SERS signals can be amplified as high
as 1014 in some nanomaterial systems, and single-molecule
detection has been achieved.2 Due to the
development of nanomaterials, SERS has been widely used in surface
and interface research, chemical and biological sensors, biomedical
monitoring, trace analysis, and electrochemical and catalytic reactions.
In addition, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) has made great
strides in ultrahigh sensitivity detection and has further enabled
Raman spectroscopy to achieve single-molecule detection. SERS has
been widely used to study DNA, protein, and biological cell systems,
and with the development of Raman imaging technology, the research
and applications of SERS technology in biological systems have been
further promoted. Furthermore, the above laboratory studies have shown
high value in clinical applications. Currently, SERS is one of the
most interesting subjects in major publications and at spectral conferences.
In particular, the participation of researchers in the fields of materials
science and biomedicine has strengthened SERS research.3

Compared with mass spectrometry, polarography,
and fluorescence
spectroscopy, SERS technology does not require complex sample pretreatment,
and the most important feature of SERS is its high sensitivity, selectivity,
and suitability for various analytical systems. Although the application
range of SERS has been continuously expanding and has involved many
fields, such as physics, chemistry, biomedical diagnosis, and materials
characterization, to adapt to complex detection requirements, the
development of joint complementary technologies is needed. For example,
fiber optic technology is used to assemble SERS materials onto optical
fibers as a highly sensitive detection sensor. Recently, Raman imaging
technology has been gradually developed. With the help of modern confocal
micro-Raman spectroscopy instruments and new signal detection devices,
the simple single-point analysis method has been extended to the comprehensive
analysis of samples within a certain range using images. These devices
can supply more information than previous methods on the chemical
composition of samples, surface physicochemical properties, etc. For
example, the high-resolution single-molecule Raman imaging data presented
by Hou et al. were highly influential on an international scale.4

Since SERS is a surface enhancement technology,
its advancement
is inseparable from the development of the substrate. Researchers
have endeavored to find a better substrate than those previously used
to obtain a higher SERS enhancement effect and optimal performance.4 Initially, the SERS effect was observed by the
rough surface of an electrode. Later, many experiments found that
gold, silver, and copper can produce a strong SERS effect. Under the
excitation of visible and near-infrared (NIR) light, gold or/and silver
nanostructures have a strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect,
which can generate a strong electromagnetic field. Therefore, gold
and silver nanoparticles and their prepared nanostructures are widely
used in SERS detection. Transition metal materials also demonstrated
SERS enhancement. The phenomena in which the surfaces of Pt, Ru, Rh,
Pd, Fe, Co, and Ni exhibit high-quality SERS signals have been successfully
observed. The SERS enhancement by precious metals and transition metals
is primarily due to an electromagnetic field enhancement. However,
with the development of nanotechnology, an increasing number of semiconductor
materials, such as metal oxides, have been discovered and prepared,
and they exhibit unique properties. In the 1980s, researchers found
that some semiconductor materials exhibit unique enhanced Raman signals.5 As an ideal SERS substrate, semiconductors need
to be prepared and used easily, have good stability, and have high
enhancement and SERS reproducibility. With the development of nanotechnology,
semiconductors provide a new approach for research on the application
of SERS. Semiconductors provide new opportunities for theoretical
SERS research. Since a correlation between experimental and theoretical
work has been achieved, an ideal model for studying the SERS mechanism
is attainable.

At present, the well-recognized SERS enhancement
mechanism is mainly
divided into a physical enhancement mechanism called an electromagnetic
enhancement mechanism (EM) and a chemical enhancement mechanism (CM).4 However, it is believed that the enhancement
of SERS is still not ideal. Determining methods to study the enhancement
mechanism of SERS will enable further enhancements for the family
of SERS substrates. As one of the main enhancement mechanisms for
SERS, CM includes a charge transfer (CT) process between the substrate
and probe molecules. To explain the contributions of CT, Lombardi
and Brike derived the Herzberg–Teller surface selection rules.
These researchers showed that CM could increase the nontotally symmetric
intensities, which reveal a strong wavelength or voltage dependence.
Recently, the authors designed a semiconductor-based CT study to avoid
EM contributions, which enabled a detailed explanation of the CM of
SERS. Semiconductors have an energy gap between a full valence band
(VB) and an empty conduction band (CB); thus, the CT between semiconductor
nanomaterials and molecules depends on their energy levels (including
the CB, VB, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) and the coupling between their
energy levels. However, most semiconductor SERS enhancements have
not been explained by an electromagnetic field enhancement. In fact,
several micro- and nanostructures of semiconductors exhibited high
electric fields. It is considered that the Mie resonance was induced
by the superstructure size of the semiconductors, which contributed
to the EM enhancement for SERS.6

Herein, we outline the study of three types of semiconductor-based
SERS-enhanced mechanisms: inorganic semiconductor-based SERS, metal–semiconductor
composite SERS, and organic semiconductor-based SERS.

Inorganic Semiconductor-Based SERS
Based on the above
background information, some groups have conducted
in-depth research on the surface enhancement of semiconductor materials.
Generally, the SERS of an inorganic semiconductor is mainly considered
a chemical enhancement, that is, a CT contribution, so that the signal
of the molecule is enhanced. Some researchers have focused on studying
the SERS mechanism using CT states in semiconductor materials.7 Many studies have shown that a strategy for studying
the SERS mechanism from the carrier distribution, density, and motion
trends is effective, which enriches the theoretical explanation of
semiconductor-based SERS.

Researchers have observed strong SERS
signals from some semiconductor
nanomaterials, such as ZnO, ZnS, Pb3O4, CuO,
CdTe, and TiO2 (Figure 1),8 and they initially carried
out studies on ion-doped semiconductors as SERS substrates.9 Based on the study of pure semiconductor materials,
several semiconductor-doped SERS substrates, such as doped ZnO and
doped TiO2, were synthesized and prepared. Satisfactory
SERS activity is easily achieved by a doped semiconductor by changing
the doping species and ion content to change the surface defect concentration
and band gap of semiconductor nanoparticles. Moreover, the enhancement
mechanism of transition metal ion-doped semiconductors as SERS
substrates was studied. Similarly, the SERS mechanism was explained
by using CT states in ion-doped semiconductor materials. Several studies
have shown that the SERS mechanism can be effectively studied by the
carrier distribution, density, and movement trends, which enable an
approach for the design of theoretical validation experiments in this
project.10 In addition, oxygen incorporation
and extraction processes may result in SERS enhancement, which may
be due to exciton resonances due to enhanced CT resonance and sensible
control of oxygen ingress in the semiconductor substrate.11 Notably, Mo-doped Ta2O5 nanorods exhibited a remarkable SERS sensitivity with an enhancement
factor (EF) of 2.2 × 107, which is the strongest EF
reported for a semiconductor to date. The main contribution to the
remarkable enhancement is the molecule resonance, the photoinduced
CT resonance between the probe molecules and Ta2O5 nanorods, and the EM enhancement around the gap and the tip of the
anisotropic Ta2O5 nanorods. The light-induced
CT from the CB of the semiconductor to the HOMO of the molecule is
significantly enhanced.12 Xi et al. and
Tan et al. have been working on the surface SERS phenomenon (graphene-enhanced
Raman scattering (GERS)) of two-dimensional heterostructures (WSe2, graphene and graphene composite materials) to largely explain
the CT process, which aids our understanding of the SERS enhancement
mechanism.13 Miao et al. reported the effect
of phase transition on the Raman enhancement properties of two-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials. The experimental
results show that when MoX2 (X = S, Se) is a metal 1T phase
structure the CT efficiency between the substrate and the adsorbed
molecules is higher than that of the intrinsic 2H phase, so the EF
is higher.14

Raman scattering. (Reproduced

To gain a deeper understanding of the CT mechanism,
researchers
have designed a sandwich structure to observe the CT process between
the semiconductor and the probe molecule. Guo et al.15 designed two structures, namely, TiO2–4-mercaptobenzoic
acid (MBA)–CdS and CdS–MBA–TiO2, and
they have explored the CT process between TiO2 and CdS
nanoparticles based on SERS. 4-MBA, which shows clear changes in the
Raman intensities and Raman shifts, was employed as the linker and
probe molecule between the CdS and TiO2 nanoparticles.
For the different systems (TiO2–MBA–CdS and
CdS–MBA–TiO2), different CT processes were
obtained because of the effect on the dipole moment of an MBA molecule.

The “co-enhancement” phenomenon of the phonon vibration
and the probe molecular vibration in semiconductor substrates were
studied in terms of the preparation of WO2.72 (W18O49) as the SERS substrate (Figure 2), in which the vibration of the phonon mode
and the vibration of the probe molecule after adsorption of the probe
molecule were the focus. The phenomenon of “co-enhancement”
and the mechanism that leads to this phenomenon have been investigated.16 Due to the Mie scattering resonance effect,
submicrometer-sized spherical ZnO superstructures were discovered
to provide additional SERS enhancement. This finding offers a new
approach to design high-performance SERS-active semiconductor substrates.17

possible SERS enhancement methods in W18O49:

More importantly, with the development of NIR semiconductor
materials,
many NIR semiconductor materials, such as Cu2–xSe nanoparticles that exhibit NIR SPR, have been
used in SERS studies. A plasmon-mediated chemical reaction was observed
on Cu2–xSe nanoparticles for the
reduction of 4-nitrobenzenethiol to 4,4′-dimercaptoazobenzene
based on SERS, which was known to be mediated by the generation of
plasmon-derived hot electrons to initiate the multielectron reduction
reaction.18

Metal/Semiconductor Composite-Based SERS
The performance
of single nanomaterials has limitations, so composite
materials have been developed and have considerable application value.
Compared with single nanomaterials, composite materials composed of
two or more materials have a greatly improved performance, improved
application value, and wider application fields. It is difficult to
achieve strong SERS enhancement with simple semiconductor materials.
Therefore, the development of precious metal and semiconductor composite
materials can expand the theoretical and application development of
SERS technology. The design and development of new composite SERS-active
substrates are beneficial for theoretical and applied studies on SERS.
Precious metals have been compounded with traditional semiconductor
materials and have become a hotspot in SERS research due to their
relatively simple recovery and excellent performance. In noble metal–semiconductor
structures, noble metals exhibit a strong SPR effect in the visible
region, which can expand the light absorption. At the same time, noble
metals generally have a lower Fermi level than that of semiconductors,
and they can promote the separation effect of photogenerated electrons
and holes and contribute to the promotion of the CT efficiency between
metals. For the novel SERS discoveries, a new material model needs
to be developed that places high demands on the design and preparation
of materials for applications (Figure 3).19

nanorod TiO2 heterostructures decorated with AgNP hybrid
arrays for photoinduced enhanced Raman spectroscopy detection. (Reproduced

Recently, to expand the applicability of SERS,
researchers have
used metal/semiconductor composites as SERS substrates to observe
SERS signals from probe molecules adsorbed on semiconductor surfaces.
A series of systems designed to study CMs were designed including
Ag/CuO nanocomposites and Ag/4-MPH/TiO2 CT complexes, Au/ZnO/PATP/Ag
and TiO2–MBA–Au assemblies, etc.8 In the Cu/ZnO/PATP/Ag assembly,20 it was found that by adjusting the energy level changes
reliable experimental conclusions could be drawn based on the SERS
spectral differences related to the material properties. When the
laser illuminates the system, if the energy levels between the various
unit materials match, then for the molecule, a CT resonance effect
from the semiconductor to the molecule or from the molecule to the
semiconductor is generated, thereby increasing the Raman scattering
intensity of the molecule. The prepared substrate can be used not
only for preparing highly active SERS substrates for medical detection
but also for optical properties, magnetic properties, photodegradation,
and solar cell applications.

Researchers have modified the surface
of traditional SERS-active
materials by modifying the composition of materials, such as SiO2/Al2O3, graphene, and TiO2 semiconductors, to avoid direct contact between the system to be
tested and the metal materials.21 The layer
interface effect contributes significantly to SERS. SERS is a more
versatile and practical method than other methods because this structure
can be applied to detect the greatest number of surface chemical components
of various materials and substrates with any morphology. Bing Zhao’s
group studied the SERS effect by the direct contact interface between
the metal and semiconductor (TiO2, ZnO, CuO, etc.) and
regulated the CT behavior induced by the metal–semiconductor
heterojunctions. This research provides a new strategy for studying
the SERS mechanism in metal–semiconductor composite systems.22 The metal–semiconductor heterojunction
has the characteristics of improving the visible-light response and
the photoexcited electron–hole lifetime. The direct contact
interface between the metal and the semiconductor provides an optocoupler
interface channel to the system, thereby improving the charge separation
efficiency.23 Furthermore, this research
establishes a simple and effective way of studying the influence of
SPR on interfacial CT by using SERS, which is beneficial for further
investigations on interfacial CT.

With the development of nanofabrication
technology, layer-by-layer
sputtering and cosputtering techniques have been employed to fabricate
metal/semiconductor materials on nanoarray templates. Layer-by-layer
sputtering of Cu2S and Ag on an array structure has been
used in SERS and SPR studies. An enhanced Raman spectrum is obtained
using 4-MBA as a probe molecule and exciting with different wavelength
excitation lines. This enhancement is due to the combination of excitation
transitions and electron-to-semiconductor transitions at certain excitation
wavelengths. The study of this composite structure provides a new
approach for examining the surface plasmon oscillation regulation
and CT mechanism.23 In addition, cosputtering
of Ag and Cu2S on a polystyrene (PS) template resulted
in an excellent localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that was
tunable because of the control of the carrier density of the Ag and
Cu2S composite substrates. The LSPR and CT determined by
the carrier concentration were investigated by adjusting the semiconductor
content. Here, the effect of the controllable carrier concentration
on the LSPR and CT in the same system is discussed. By changing the
sputtering power of Cu2S in the Ag and Cu2S
composite substrates, the LSPR can be easily adjusted from 580 to
743 nm. Surprisingly, the LSPR can be precisely regulated by changing
the semiconductor content or even the carrier density. The carrier
density is characterized by the Hall effect to analyze the Raman shift
caused by CT and to obtain the relationship between them (Figure 4).23

resonance and CT observed by SERS for the cosputtering of Ag and Cu2S. (Reproduced with permission from ref (23). Copyright 2018, American

Organic Semiconductor-Based SERS
Organic films based
on small molecular semiconductors (SMSs) offer
unique advantages over their inorganic and macromolecular counterparts,
including structural versatility, facile and highly controllable synthesis
and film fabrication, and fine tuning of optoelectronic properties.
With the development of battery materials, researchers have introduced
Raman spectroscopy to understand CT processes in battery systems.
It was found that organic semiconductor materials also increase the
SERS activity and that SERS is a powerful tool for understanding the
performance of organic electronic devices.

Notably, in 2017,
Yilmaz et al. confirmed that the nanoscale organic
semiconductor α,ω-diperfluorohexylquaterthiophene (DFH-4T)
molecule with hydrophobic properties can significantly enhance the
signal of the probe molecule (methylene blue) with an EF of 3.4 ×
103 (Figure 5).24 The SERS enhancement of the proposed
pristine organic film is due to the CT between the molecule and the
organic substrate. This interpretation is consistent with the resonance
description of SERS in that the CT resonance between the molecule
and substrate is vibronically coupled to the nearby molecular transition
and borrows intensity from it. This discovery provides a new direction
for enhanced Raman based on organic semiconductors. At the same time,
this effect is precisely why organic semiconductors are often used
as electron transport layers or hole transport layers in solar cells.
This discovery introduces new ways for studying the carrier dynamics
in organic solar cells.

spectra of methylene blue (MB) on a pristine DH-4T film (the inset

Subsequently, Lombardi24 commented on
the work done by Yilmaz et al., with high praise. It has been demonstrated
that organic semiconductor films are superior to metal films in terms
of stability and reproducibility. Another advantage of organic semiconductor
films is the ability to functionally modulate their properties. Coinage
metals are similar to a versatile matrix that works for almost any
molecule because the Fermi level of the metal lies between the HOMO
and the LUMO. The contribution to the CT, coupled with the plasmon
resonance, results in a high enhancement. In contrast, the CT between
a molecule and a semiconductor substrate involves a semiconductor
band edge rather than a Fermi level. The band edge of the semiconductor
can be easily adjusted to optimize the CT to specific molecules.

SERS technology is used to study the dynamics of carriers in solar
cells. The selection of active substrates is the primary issue for
SERS technology. For organic semiconductors commonly used in solar
cells, this theory is equally applicable, as reported by Lombardi
et al.24 However, unlike inorganic semiconductors,
these conductive polymers have a high degree of energy and spatial
distribution disorder, so carrier transport can only be from one local
state to another. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate
(PEDOT:PSS) is a conjugated conductive polymer with good semiconductor
properties. The material can be prepared in solution form at room
temperature by various processing methods and is often used as a hole
transport layer in solar cells. In the conjugated structure, the overlap
of the orbitals leads to the formation of two delocalized states,
namely, the LUMO and HOMO. This premise ensures that the CT process
in the SERS of organic semiconductors is highly similar to that in
the SERS of inorganic semiconductors. Nevertheless, the discussion
of organic semiconductors in the enhancement mechanism of SERS is
still in its infancy, and the discussion of organic conjugated conductive
polymers is currently inactive.25

Another important development is the study of the SERS mechanism
by combining organic semiconductors and metal nanoparticles. Stavytska-Barba
et al.25 reported poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) deposited over triangular silver nanoprisms
that exhibits excellent SERS enhancement. These nanoprisms have many
desirable properties, including large EM enhancement, extensive tunability
of a plasmon resonance in the visible spectrum, and self-assembly
that does not aggregate on the surface of the silicide glass. In addition,
the system demonstrates direct spectral evidence of enhanced charge
carrier generation. SERS enhancement can be employed to measure the
extent of electromagnetic field enhancement caused by nanoparticles
and to examine any changes in Raman spectral properties that may indicate
the chemical or morphological effects of the metal on nearby organic
materials.

Summary and Outlook
In this review, we outlined a variety
of SERS-active inorganic
semiconductors, metal/semiconductor composites, and organic semiconductor
materials and summarized their basic enhancement mechanism. The main
contribution of most semiconductor-based SERS is the CT between the
semiconductor and the probe molecule, which improves the SERS enhancement.
The theoretical development provides strong support for the practical
applications of SERS technology, which demonstrates the great potential
for applications of semiconductor-enhanced Raman scattering in solar
cells and life science.

Semiconductor SERS substrates have higher
SERS uniformity and better
chemical stability and biocompatibility compared with those of other
types of SERS substrates. In addition, the efficient use of semiconductor
SERS substrates may widen the applications of SERS in many fields.
Therefore, the design and fabrication of semiconductor materials with
high CT efficiency and high EM enhancement will be the basis for SERS
applications. However, the selection of SERS-active semiconductor
substrates is the primary issue to be addressed. In addition, a small
number of molecules were found to be selectively enhanced by semiconductors,
which limits the application of semiconductor-based SERS. Direct monitoring
of the interfacial chemical reactions of individual nanoparticles
remains an enormous challenge. Moreover, the chemical and life science
applications of SERS technology are still very limited by SERS-active
materials; thus, developing semiconductor materials with high biocompatibility
and low biological damage is one of the directions of SERS development.
More importantly, due to the high excitation light energy in the visible
region, the structure of biological macromolecules is often destroyed.
Therefore, developing NIR semiconductor materials with high SERS activity
will expand the life science applications of SERS. The field of semiconductor-based
SERS will continue to evolve and grow with new developments and successful
applications in various scientific areas.
