Currently, ternary CuCo2S4 sulfides are intensively
investigated as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors
due to their low cost, high conductivity, and synergistic effect.
The research of CuCo2S4 materials for energy
storage has gradually grown from 2016. The supercapacitive performances
of CuCo2S4 electrodes for electrochemical capacitors
are briefly reviewed in this work. The structure, morphology, and
particle size of CuCo2S4 are related to the
synthesis conditions and electrochemical performances. The thin films
of CuCo2S4 nanostructures deposited on conductive
substrates and their composites both show better properties than single
CuCo2S4. CuCo2S4 and its
composites reveal large potential for asymmetric capacitors, delivering
high energy densities. However, there is still much new space remaining
for future research. The possible development directions, challenges,
and opportunities for CuCo2S4 materials are
also discussed.

1 Introduction
With the increasing demand for sustainable new power sources, energy
storage devices with high energy densities are being intensively researched.
In addition to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and full cells, electrochemical
capacitors (ECs), or supercapacitors, have also gained much attention
due to their advantages including large power density, long lifespan,
fast charge–discharge rates, free maintenance, and low cost,
etc. ECs are novel energy storage devices that bridge the gap between
batteries and conventional capacitors. However, ECs still suffer from
low-energy density before extensive application. The essential factor
to primarily determine the performance of ECs is the electrode materials.
Compared to carbon materials with high surface areas resulting in
electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) attribution, the battery-like
materials that can provide Faradaic redox reactions are deemed to
be more prospective for actual application. Many transition metal
compounds including sulfides,1 oxides,2 and hydroxides,3 thus,
have been studied for ECs.

Recently, transition metal sulfide
has been considered as one of
the most prominent materials for ECs and LIBs because of its complex
valence and large crystal lattice values.4 Metal sulfides usually have higher conductivity and activity, lower
electronegativity, as well as lower band gap than corresponding oxides.
Previous reports found that the presence of Cu in the host sulfides
could improve the conductivity and played as a buffer matrix for the
volume expansion.4a Thus, copper-containing
sulfides have been highlighted because of their natural abundance,
excellent stability, and low cost. At the same time, compared to binary
sulfides, ternary copper sulfides usually exhibit richer redox reactions
and higher conductivity, leading to improved electrochemical performances
due to the combined contribution from each component and the synergistic
effect between individual elements. Many Cu-based ternary sulfides
have been developed for ECs, such as CuCo2S4, CuSbS2, Cu2MoS4, Cu2WS4, etc.1,4a

In this work, a short overview
of the recent development of CuCo2S4 ternary
sulfides toward EC electrodes is provided.
To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to the current
progress of CuCo2S4 for ECs. CuCo2S4 materials have been studied recently, and they have
shown huge potential. The papers related to CuCo2S4 for ECs began to be published in 2016. Thus, CuCo2S4 materials and composites for ECs are summarized and
discussed in this mini-review.

2 Pure CuCo2S4 Materials
CuCo2S4 is of a
spinel phase with the space
group of Fd3m, as schematically
shown in Figure 1.
Though CuCo2S4 is a very new material to ECs,
it is the most widely researched electrode material among all the
copper-containing ternary sulfides. The commonly reported approaches
to synthesize CuCo2S4 electrodes are the anion
exchange and solvothermal methods. The former involves multisteps
and needs some hydroxides or oxides as a precursor to be exchanged
by sulfur anions at moderate temperatures, even at room temperature.5 The anion exchange process usually causes a hollow
structure through the Kirkendall effect, leading to a high surface
area. CuCo2S4 materials can also be directly
synthesized by the solvothermal method.6 It is usually carried out in polyols under a higher temperature
than anion exchange.

Figure 1 Crystal structure of the spinel phase of CuCo2S4.

Because the electrochemical performances
of CuCo2S4 are influenced by the morphology,
structure, and particle
size and store charge only in the first few nanometers from the surface,
CuCo2S4 materials with abundant mesopores and
small particle sizes are favored. Researchers have found that the
reaction medium had a large impact on the structure of CuCo2S4 materials.7,8 Tang and coworkers7 compared CuCo2S4 materials
synthesized in water and polyols, and the material prepared in polyols
showed higher surface area and larger specific capacitance than that
synthesized in water, even up to 5030 F g–1. Zhu
et al.8a reported that the solvent and
mole content of chemicals determined the microstructure and electrochemical
performances of CuCo2S4 materials. Zequine et
al.8b also reported the morphology dependence
of CuCo2S4 on the volume ratio of water to ethanol,
and the optimized electrode showed a much higher specific capacitance
of 3190.8 F g–1 than its oxide precursor. Other
reaction conditions were also investigated. For example, microwave
irradiation could accelerate the reaction process to prepare CuCo2S4 nanoparticles in several minutes.9 Guo et al.5 found
that the reaction temperature influenced the crystallinity and electrochemical
properties of CuCo2S4. The partial substitution
of Co by Ni can improve the electrochemical performances of CuCo2–xNixS4. However, a high content of Ni will produce a multiphased
composite.10 The reaction conditions and
chemical composition will greatly affect CuCo2S4 materials and their electrochemical performance.10,11

Hollow CuCo2S4 structures are especially
expected to show high performances due to the available inner space.
Hollow CuCo2S4 microspheres could be prepared
by a self-templated method12 or bubble-supported
solvothermal method.6aFigure 2(a) shows the ionic transport
process of hollow CuCo2S4 microspheres and the
Faradaic reaction equations.12 The hollow
morphology could improve the structural and cycling stability by shortening
diffusion pathways for ions. The CuCo2S4 materials
with hollow cores demonstrated a specific capacitance of 1137.5 F
g–1 at 2 A g–1.6a

Apart from electrode materials, the electrode structure is also
an important factor to determine the final performances of ECs. The
growth of nanostructured CuCo2S4 materials on
current collectors is a highly preferred strategy for EC electrodes
due to the reduced resistance, large conductivity, and high utilization
efficiency of the materials. A variety of CuCo2S4 structures deposited on different conductive substrates as current
collectors have been synthesized and used as work electrodes directly,
such as CuCo2S4 nanorod arrays grown on carbon
textile,13 CuCo2S4 microspheres on carbon cloth,14 CuCo2S4 nanosheets,15 flower-like
CuCo2S4,16 CuCo2S4 nanowires,17 CuCo2S4 hollow nanoneedles,18 and oriented CuCo2S4 nanograss arrays deposited
on Ni foam.19 The synthetic procedure of
CuCo2S4 hollow nanoneedles on Ni foam is illustrated
in Figure 2(b), where
the hollow structure is formed in the second hydrothermal step through
the Kirkendall effect.18 This strategy
can avoid painting electrode materials, without conductive additive
and polymer binders. However, it is hard to achieve a large mass loading
on given-size conductive substrates. Too high mass loading will cause
a low conductivity and weak adhesion between the substrates and thick
CuCo2S4 films. Thus, a reasonable mass loading
on each electrode should be optimized.

Table 1 shows the
electrochemical properties of pure CuCo2S4 materials
for ECs. Powder CuCo2S4 samples with various
morphologies have different specific capacitance values. However,
the thin films of CuCo2S4 grown on conductive
substrates usually exhibit higher specific capacitance as compared
to powder materials.

3 CuCo2S4 Composites
Though various
CuCo2S4 nanostructures and
thin films on conductive substrates have demonstrated promising potential
for ECs, there are still some problems. The electrical conductivity
and the accessible surface area should be further increased in order
to obtain much better performances. To homogeneously improve the conductivity,
an effective method is designing a composite consisting of CuCo2S4 and highly conductive materials such as graphite,
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, graphene quantum dots, etc. Carbon
materials are ideal choices to integrate with active CuCo2S4, and they can also deliver EDLC. Meanwhile, the presence
of guest carbon materials can form 3D architectures with large surface
area and reduced crystal size of CuCo2S4.

The composite of CuCo2S4@graphite exhibited
a high specific capacitance, two times higher than CuCo2S4, as reported by Chen et al.20 Nanocrystallites of CuCo2S4 deposited on CNTs
were synthesized by the solvothermal method, and the composite showed
excellent performances for both LIBs and ECs.21 As exhibited in Figure 3(a,b), small CuCo2S4 nanoparticles with
size of about 5–20 nm are anchored on the surface of CNTs,
and C, N, Cu, Co, and S uniformly distribute throughout the whole
structure.21 Hierarchical CuCo2S4 nanosheets decorated on CNTs were synthesized by a
two-step process, and the composite exhibited a specific capacitance
of 1690.3 F g–1 at 1 A g–1.22

Graphene is also an ideal skeleton
to support CuCo2S4 nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 3(c,d).23 The CuCo2S4 nanoparticles
on graphene are not aggregated,
and the sizes of them are uniform. On the contrary, the synthesized
CuCo2S4 without graphene (the inset in Figure 3c) appears to undergo
severe aggregation. The TEM image of CuCo2S4/graphene in Figure 3(d) shows the CuCo2S4 nanoparticles and thin
graphene layers. The histogram inserted in Figure 3(d) reveals that the nanoparticles have an
average diameter of 21 nm. N-doped graphene could provide a large
surface area to reduce the aggregation and size of CuCo2S4 nanoparticles, too. The composite of CuCo2S4/N-doped graphene showed a specific capacitance of 1005
F g–1 at 1 A g–1 and good rate
capability.24 Graphene quantum dots/CuCo2S4 electrodes demonstrated a specific capacitance
of 1725 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1.25 The reported electrochemical performances of
the composites comprised of CuCo2S4 and carbon
materials are summarized in Table 2. From the above reports, the composites of CuCo2S4 and conductive carbon nanomaterials have a better
ability to store energy than pure CuCo2S4.

Another kind of composite is combing
CuCo2S4 with other battery-like electrode materials
including transition
metal hydroxides, sulfides, oxides, etc. Very recently, the composites
of CuCo2S4 and battery-like materials begin
to draw increasing attention because each component can have redox
reactions to storage energy. Ma et al.26a reported that CuCo2S4–NiCo2S4 core–shell nanostructures on Ni foam had a large
surface area and rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions by numerous channels
and that the composite presented excellent electrochemical performances
owing to the synergistic effect. A core–shell CuCo2S4-NiCo(OH)2 electrode had a higher capacitance
of 2340 F g–1 at 1 A g–1 than
any individual component due to both contributions in the core–shell
hybrid.26b Similarly, Lin et al.26c reported that the CuCo2S4@NiMn(OH)2 electrode had a higher specific capacitance
than the single component. The structure of CuCo2S4@NiMn(OH)2 on Ni foam is exhibited in Figure 4(a). A typical TEM
image in Figure 4(b)
shows than a CuCo2S4 nanotube as the core is
uniformly covered by thin NiMn(OH)2 nanosheets as the shell.26c CuCo2S4/CuCo2O4 heterostructures with different S contents were prepared,
and they exhibited a high surface area, large conductivity, and rapid
electron and ion transport rates.26d This
kind of composite was just reported in the last two years. It is urgent
to develop and research new composites with unique structures and
compositions.

In addition to carbon and battery-like electrode
materials combined
with CuCo2S4, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was also
reported. CuCo2S4/PAN flexible film electrodes
were prepared by curing the ink directly and investigated for ECs,
as reported by Chen et al.27Figure 4(c,d) illustrates the schematic
diagram of the preparation of CuCo2S4/PAN film
and its photograph. The ink of CuCo2S4/PAN showed
excellent heat stability with a specific capacitance of 385 F g–1 at 1 A g–1.

4 CuCo2S4 Electrodes for
Asymmetric ECs
The energy density equation for ECs is E = CV2/2. It can also be increased
by enlarging
the voltage window. In order to obtain a wide voltage window, building
asymmetric ECs (AECs) is an effective way. Generally, AECs can be
classified into two kinds, EDLC//redox5,13,22,15,17,20,22,24 and redox//redox.15b

For AECs of CuCo2S4 electrodes, carbon
negative
electrodes are popularly used, typically activated carbon (AC). The
voltage range of AECs is large, usually higher than 1.5 V, revealing
practical application. CuCo2S4 and AC electrodes
were assembled on an AEC device that delivered an energy density of
50.56 Wh kg–1 within 1.6 V.5Figure 5(a) clearly
shows the bunched structure of CuCo2S4 nanorods
on carbon textiles. The AEC of CuCo2S4 nanorod
arrays//AC had a high energy density of 56.96 Wh kg–1 at 1.6 V, and two AECs connected in series could light up 15 light-emitting
diodes (LED), as shown in Figure 5(b).13 With CuCo2S4/CNTs as positive electrode and CNTs as negative electrode,
an AEC showed a large energy density of 37.32 Wh kg–1 at 800.7 W kg–1 within 1.6 V.22 A hybrid capacitor of CuCo2S4@NiCo2S4//AC delivered an energy density of 23.4 Wh kg–1 with a voltage window of 1.6 V.26a Xu et al.26d prepared 3D mesoporous
flower-like CuCo2S4/CuCo2O4 composites with compatible interfaces and tunable composition. The
AEC devices are fabricated in parallel-plate geometry, as illustrated
in Figure 5(c). The
measured specific capacitance and corresponding capacitance retention
of the ASC device based on the discharge curves at different current
densities are plotted in Figure 5(d). The AECs of CuCo2S4/CuCo2O4//graphene provided an energy density of 33.2
Wh kg–1 at a power density of 800 W kg–1 in 1.6 V.26d The energy densities and
power density of the reported CuCo2S4 electrodes
in AECs are summarized in Table 3. As compared to other AEC devices,2,3 the
energy density of CuCo2S4 electrodes is higher.
From the above results, both CuCo2S4 and its
composites have shown excellent performances as positive electrodes
of AECs.

In addition to AECs, symmetric capacitors were also researched
using CuCo2S4 electrodes. Wang et al.19 applied CuCo2S4 nanograss@Ni
foam electrodes to assemble symmetric ECs. The symmetric device showed
an energy density of 31.88 Wh kg–1 at 3.03 kW kg–1 within 1.5 V. More recently, core–shell like
nanoparticles of CuCo2S4@NiCo(OH)2 on Ni foam were used as two electrodes to build a symmetric capacitor
in 3 M KOH.26b It exhibited the power density
of 32 Wh kg–1 at 750 W kg–1 within
1.5 V. The energy densities of the two reports are comparable.

5 Conclusions and Outlooks
CuCo2S4 has multiple valence and high electrical
conductivities that endow it superior photocatalyst and electrocatalyst
activity. The research on CuCo2S4 materials
for energy storage began to boost in 2016, and most reports were recently
published. It is a new research focus, and there still is a lot of
room for researchers to deeply investigate it in the future.

Some basic features of CuCo2S4 materials
such as morphology, particle size, structure, and crystallinity have
been proved to be influenced by the synthesis conditions. Thus, they
can be finely controlled by the reaction conditions. New methods are
still expected to be developed to prepare CuCo2S4 with excellent electrochemical performances.

Designing new
composites has been revealed to be an effective method
to further improve the electrochemical performance of CuCo2S4. The composites consisting of CuCo2S4 and carbon nanomaterials or metal compounds can exhibit better
electrochemical behavior than single CuCo2S4. However, only limited pseudocapacitive materials have been reported
to integrate with CuCo2S4 up to now.

The
reported electrochemical performances, such as specific capacitance
and energy density, for CuCo2S4 and its composites
are diverse in a wide range. In addition to various electrolytes and
measurement systems, it can be attributed to the difference in both
materials including structure, surface area, particle size, etc.,
and the structure of electrodes, such as mass loading, binder involving
or not. Meanwhile, CuCo2S4 and its composites
are also potential electrodes for AECs due to their large specific
capacitance and high energy densities. Assembling asymmetric and symmetric
capacitor devices using CuCo2S4 electrodes are
two promising directions.

Very recently, Gao et al.10 found that
the surface of Ni-substituted CuCo2S4 was partially
oxidized by air to form metal sulfate, and this caused the gradual
dissolution of electrode materials in the aqueous electrolyte, leading
to an unsatisfied cycling stability. Thus, the possibility of surface
oxidization for CuCo2S4 materials is an important
issue.
