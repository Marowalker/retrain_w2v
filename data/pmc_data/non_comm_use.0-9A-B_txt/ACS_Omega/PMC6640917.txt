The quest for designing efficient
heterogeneous catalytic systems
for tandem oxidative cyclization reactions has provided a great impetus
to research efforts, as it enables the step-economic construction
of complex heterocyclic molecules as well as confers the benefits
of a facile catalytic recovery. In the present study, we disclose
a new core–shell-structured organic–inorganic hybrid
copper nanocatalyst fabricated via the covalent grafting of 2,2′-dipyridyl
ketone ligand on amine-functionalized silica-encapsulated magnetite
nanoparticles, followed by its metallation with cupric acetate for
the tandem oxidative cyclization of amines and β-ketoesters,
leading to the production of biologically active polysubstituted oxazole
moieties. This programmed catalytic protocol proceeds via the formation
of intermolecular C–C and C–N bonds by single-step synthesis
and accommodates a broad combination of reaction coupling partners.

1 Introduction
Synthetic
organic chemistry has reached a crucial point in which
new paradigms are needed to achieve the challenging goals of step
economy and waste reduction. Tandem reactions, often
called cascade reactions that are capable of smartly combining different
organocatalytic reaction steps in a single-pot synthesis, have emerged
as one of the most powerful and practical tools to construct complex
heterocyclic architectures for multifaceted intents.1−6 In fact, these reactions have proliferated in the area of total
organic synthesis ever since the publication of the pioneering work
of Robinson in 1917 on the seminal synthesis of tropinone.7 The main driving force of the huge synthetic
efforts is the undeniable benefits of high atom economy and reduced
waste generation, which cause such reactions to fall under the banner
of green chemistry.8 Besides enabling the
economical and environmentally friendly synthesis of targeted molecules
of considerable structural and stereochemical complexity, the cascade
processes expand our repertoire of reactions and strategies by allowing
the use of synthetically enabling intermediates that may or may not
be practical or possible to isolate.9 Indeed,
it is the enduring efficiency and overall esthetic appeal of these
processes that have prompted chemists to explore novel reaction cascades
for the synthesis of complex polycyclic ring skeletons, which serve
as important scaffolds of natural products with important bioactivities.
In this direction, the recent attempts to obtain the exceedingly significant
biologically active polysubstituted oxazole moieties using the copper-catalyzed
tandem oxidative cyclization (TOC) pathway are worth applauding.10−15 Although this strategy presents a convincible methodological refinement
over the classical procedures in terms of the drastic enhancement
in atom economy and reaction conditions, yet the exploitation of homogeneous
metal salt as the catalyst renders its commercial utility rather bleak
because of the associated problems of separation and recovery. In
view of these limitations, the search for a sustainable heterogeneous
catalyst that can provide a ready access to the target oxazole moieties
remains an important yet elusive objective for engineering oxidative
cyclization reactions. So far, no such capable heterogeneous catalyst
has been created that can be applied for this transformation successfully,
which is precisely the reason that ignited the spark of interest within
us.

Modern state of the art of catalysis science and research
reveals
that the introduction of novel nanotechnologies has enabled the generation
of solid-supported heterogeneous nanoscale catalysts, which are effective
tools for controlling chemical reactivity as well as conferring the
synergistic benefits of facile recovery.16−26 By collectively integrating the key advantages of homogeneous as
well as heterogeneous catalysts, they offer great prospects of meeting
the sustainability criteria consistent with the goals of green chemistry.
However, the selection of an appropriate support material is extremely
crucial in designing such potent catalysts, as the spatial structure
of the support plays an important role in holding the active site
through strong coordination during the catalysis. Among a multitude
of solid matrices explored to date,27−39 core–shell-structured silica-encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles
have shown their unrivaled power owing to the combined benefits of
a superparamagnetic core material that permits/endows easy catalyst
separation (using an external magnet) and a surrounding shell that
imparts durability to the synthesized catalyst by protecting the core
from agglomerating, sintering, or undergoing oxidation.40−53 In addition, the shell provides the opportunity to tune the structure
and consequently the performance of the catalyst by allowing the immobilization
of a diverse array of reagents, such as linkers and functionalized
ligands. Thus, it is not surprising that the field of “design
and synthesis of magnetically recyclable core–shell nanocatalysts”
is experiencing an explosive growth, with many exciting developments
in the new millennium.

The recent fast-growing research on such
potential nanomaterials
inspired us to come up with new silica-based magnetically retrievable
core–shell nanocatalytic systems that proved their efficiency
in different organic transformations, such as C–H activation
of formamides and reductive amination of ketones.54,55 Impressed by the catalytic efficacy of such materials and in conjunction
with our ongoing research work in the design and development of sustainable
nanocatalysts,56−66 we decided to exploit the catalytic properties of the core–shell
support material, ligand, linker, and transition metal. Using a covalent
immobilization strategy, we fabricated a magnetic silica-based copper
nanocatalyst, which was characterized well by advanced combined electron
microscopy (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) and spectroscopic (Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD),
inductively coupled plasma (ICP)) techniques. This novel material
was then used in the tandem oxidative cyclization reaction to obtain
the desired/significant polysubstituted oxazole products under mild
experimental conditions. Much to our satisfaction, we found that this
new heterogeneous copper catalyst not only facilitated the formation
of the desired products with good to excellent conversion but also
enhanced the economic viability of the protocol greatly because: (i)
this new procedure replaced tert-butyl hydroperoxide
(TBHP) with H2O2, which is a greener oxidant
and (ii) for the very first time, we employed a heterogeneous catalyst
for this process that could be recovered easily by magnetic attraction
and further reused for several test cycles. Therefore, in this study,
we report the first example of a heterogeneously catalyzed protocol
for the TOC approach toward the synthesis of polysubstituted oxazoles
that opens up a new and promising insight into the course of rational
design, synthesis, and applications of core–shell magnetic
nanoparticle complexes for such reactions.

2 Results
and Discussion
The catalyst was prepared in a step-by-step
manner, beginning from
the synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4), as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Pathway for Obtaining Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 Core–Shell Nanocatalyst
For obtaining Fe3O4 nanoparticles,
a previously
reported coprecipitation approach was implemented.67 This was followed by silica encapsulation of the nanoparticles
using the modified sol–gel process in the presence of tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica precursor.68 In the next step, silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles were functionalized
using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), wherein the NH2 linker was coupled to its surface.69 Thereafter,
ligand 2,2′-bipyridyl ketone (BPy) was covalently immobilized
on the surface of the functionalized nanoparticles.70 In the last step, ligand-grafted nanoparticles were metallated
with cupric acetate for fabricating the nanocatalyst. The synthesized
nanocomposites were thereafter characterized methodically using different
physicochemical techniques, including TEM, SEM, EDX spectroscopy,
EDXRF spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, WAXRD, ICP, and vibrating sample
magnetometer (VSM) analysis.

2.1 Catalyst Characterization
WAXRD is
an effective technique that can shed light on the presence of core–shell
structures in the synthesized nanoparticles. Thus, this technique
was utilized for investigating the crystalline phases of the magnetite
nanoparticles before and after silica coating (Figure 1). The WAXRD patterns of both Fe3O4 and SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles
displayed six characteristic diffraction peaks at specific 2θ
values, corresponding to the inverse spinel structure of magnetite
well matched by the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards
(JCPDS) data (JCPDS card no.: 19-629). This result clearly signified
that the magnetic component is well retained in the prepared nanocomposites
even after the silica encapsulation process. However, in contrast
to that of pure Fe3O4, the WAXRD spectrum of
SiO2@Fe3O4 showed the presence of
a broad hump around 2θ = 20–23°, which could be
attributed to the silica shell surrounding the core material; thus,
the emergence of this new peak certified the successful encapsulation
of bare magnetite nanoparticles.68 Furthermore,
we evaluated the crystallite size of the nanoparticles by picking
the peak of highest intensity in the WAXRD spectrum of Fe3O4 and applying the Debye–Scherrer formula to it
(i.e., Dhkl = kλl/β cos θ, where D is the size of the axis parallel to the hkl plane, k is a constant with a typical value of 0.89 for spherical
particles, β is the full width at half-maxima in radians, and
θ is Bragg’s angle in degrees). The average size of the
nanoparticles was evaluated to be 11.9 nm according to the above equation.

Figure 1 WAXRD
spectrum of (a) Fe3O4 and (b) SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

TEM images were acquired to gain an insight into the morphological
characteristics of the nanoparticles. Observation by this analysis
revealed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles possess a
roughly spherical morphology with an average diameter of 8–12
nm (Figure 2). The
selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern recorded on a single
particle showed the presence of white spotty diffraction rings assignable
to the [220], [311], [400], [422], [511], and [440] planes of the
cubic inverse spinel structure of magnetite. The appearance of these
distinct diffraction rings also confirmed the polycrystalline nature
of the nanoparticles. For a detailed structural analysis, HRTEM image
of the pristine magnetite nanoparticles was captured. This image reflected
two-dimensional lattice fringes that could be indexed to the (220)
plane of pure magnetite with an interplanar separation value of 0.25
nm. The core–shell morphology of the silica-coated nanoparticles
was well supported by the representative TEM image of SiO2@Fe3O4. Distinctively, it could be seen that
the black inner core material is well embedded within the light gray
silica shell. The thickness of this shell was measured to be approximately
10 nm. Further, the TEM image of final catalyst was also provided,
which shows that the metal complex is uniformly embedded over the
core–shell surface and the particles exhibit a spherical morphology
very similar to that of the native Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(Figure S1).

Figure 2 (a) TEM image of synthesized
Fe3O4 nanoparticles,
(b) SAED pattern of Fe3O4, (c) HRTEM image of
the single nanocrystal entity with lattice fringe, and (d) TEM image
of SiO2@Fe3O4.

Surface morphology of the nanoparticles was characterized
by the
highly sophisticated field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
technique. Typical FESEM images of Fe3O4, SiO2@Fe3O4, and Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 are depicted in Figure 3. A closer look into the obtained images
divulged that the spherical morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles
was intact even after the silica coating and successive catalyst synthesis
steps. However, a noticeable surface roughening had occurred on moving
from Fe3O4 to SiO2@Fe3O4 to the final nanocatalyst. Such a distinct surface-roughening
phenomenon could be attributed to the deposition of various surface-modifying
species, such as silica, amine group, ligand, and metal, around the
core material. Also, appreciably, no separate silica aggregates were
observed that ruled out the possibility of precipitation of primary
silica nanoparticles. Further, information regarding the chemical
composition of the core–shell nanocomposites (particularly,
SiO2@Fe3O4 and Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4) was gained with the help of
EDX spectroscopy. The presence of Fe, Si, and O in the EDX survey
spectra of the silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles confirmed the
existence of the silane shell around the superparamagnetic core. In
addition to these three vital elements, distinct peaks of nitrogen,
oxygen, and copper substantiated the successful immobilization of
functionalizing agent, ligand, and metal on the surface of the silica-coated
magnetite nanosupport, thus certifying the final structure of the
nanocatalyst. The support for the presence of copper in the fabricated
catalyst was further provided by the EDXRF technique (the well-resolved
peak of copper in the EDXRF spectrum of Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 shown in Figure S2 clearly authenticated the synthesis of the catalyst). Next, the
amount of copper present in the catalyst was determined through the
ICP technique performed by first carrying out the sample digestion
in aqua regia using microwave irradiation for 10 min at 400 W, followed
by adjusting the volume of the filtrate to 100 mL using double-deionized
water, and 0.1542 mmol g–1 of copper was quantified
using calibration curve in duplicate for each sample.

(a) Fe3O4, (b) SiO2@Fe3O4, and (c) Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 and EDX spectra of (d) SiO2@Fe3O4 and (e) Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4.

For the stepwise characterization
of the synthesized nanocomposites,
FTIR spectroscopic analysis was performed under the scanning range
of 4000–400 cm–1 using KBr pellets. The appearance
of specific functional groups at every stage of catalyst preparation
helped in authenticating the structures of the parent nanocomposites
and the final catalyst. The FTIR spectra of the pristine Fe3O4, SiO2@Fe3O4, Am-SiO2@Fe3O4, BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4, and Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles are shown in Figure 4. The emergence of a strong and intense absorption
band at 589 cm−1 attributable to the characteristic
Fe−O stretching vibrations and another broad band centred around
3124 cm−1 assignable to the deforming vibrations
of adsorbed water in the FTIR spectrum of Fe3O4 nanoparticles provided a concrete proof for the structure of the
magnetite core.71 On moving toward silica-coated
magnetite nanoparticles (SiO2@Fe3O4), an obvious reduction in the intensity of the Fe–O and OH
stretching bands was observed, which could be attributed to the introduction
of the silane moiety (amorphous SiO2). In addition, three
new peaks appearing at 806, 954, and 1102 cm–1 could
be assigned to the Si–O–Si symmetric, Si–O symmetric,
and Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching modes of the silica
framework, respectively.72

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of (a) Fe3O4, (b) SiO2@Fe3O4, (c) Am-SiO2@Fe3O4, (d) BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4, and (e) Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4.

These results validated the successful encapsulation of the
core
material by the silane shell. The evidence for the functionalization
of the silica-coated nanosupport was further acquired from the occurrence
of two new absorption peaks at 2930 and 1625 cm–1 belonging to the CH2 and NH2 groups of the
aminopropyl moiety of Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles, respectively. The ligand-grafted nanoparticles on
the other hand, besides displaying all of the distinct peaks of amine-functionalized
nanoparticles, showed a strong band at 1644 cm–1 because of the C=N stretching vibration of the ligand (BPy).
After metallation, this band shifted to a lower value (i.e., 1633
cm–1), which suggested the formation of a bond between
the copper and the ligand. In our previous studies, we observed similar
band shifts in the IR spectrum. These results collectively signified
that the copper species are effectively immobilized on modified silica-coated
magnetite nanoparticles as a BPy–copper complex.

After
carrying out a detailed morphological and compositional analysis,
our focus shifted toward exploring the magnetic properties of the
catalyst (the most important property that accounts for the facile
recovery of the catalyst). A VSM was employed for this purpose, and
a comparative analogy of the magnetic hysteresis measurements of the
prepared core–shell nanomaterials (SiO2@Fe3O4 and Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4) and the uncoated magnetite (Fe3O4) was made
in an external field sweeping between −20 000 and 20 000
Oe at room temperature (r.t.) (Figure 5). The registered magnetization curves reflected the
superparamagnetic nature of the nanocomposites because of the absence
of the hysteresis phenomenon. To further substantiate this typical
feature of superparamagnetism, a narrower magnetization range was
selected and plotted (shown in the inset of Figure 5). Quite apparent from the plot, both magnetization
and demagnetization curves passed through the origin, showing negligible
coercivity (Hc, Oe) and remanence (Mr, emu g–1).
These results confirmed the superparamagnetic properties of the synthesized
nanoparticles. Further, the saturation magnetization, extracted from
the corresponding VSM curves, for the uncoated magnetite sample was
found to be 63.5 emu g–1, whereas this value decreased
to 46.9 and 30.6 emu g–1 for the coated samples.
This gradual decrease in the magnetization value of the core–shell
nanomaterials (SiO2@Fe3O4 and Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4) could be attributed to the incorporation
of the nonmagnetic silica shell around the core, which decreased the
magnetic coupling interactions between the neighboring magnetite nanoparticles.73 A possible mechanism that could be proposed
for this reduction was the disappearance of magnetic moments of Fe
due to the surface functionalization of these ions with silica to
form Fe–O–Si chemical bonds. However, it is worth mentioning
here that despite the lowering of the Ms values, the final
nanocatalyst showed ease of separation from the reaction mixture.

2.2 Activity of the Obtained Nanocatalyst in the
Synthesis of Polysubstituted Oxazoles Using the Tandem Cyclization
Approach
After structural verification of the fabricated
core–shell-structured copper nanocatalyst, we explored its
applicability in the tandem oxidative cyclization of 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds and amines for obtaining industrially significant oxazoles.
To get an insight into the optimum catalytic conditions, methylacetoacetate
and benzylamine were chosen as the model substrates. Consequently,
we screened a number of solvents, oxidants, and additives for establishing
the most compatible reaction conditions. Further, with the same objective
in mind, we investigated the effects of crucial experimental variables,
such as temperature, time, and substrate molar ratio, on this reaction.

In the initial phase of our study, we performed a controlled experiment,
wherein a 1:2 mixture of the test substrates (i.e., 1 equiv methylacetoacete
and 2 equiv benzylamine) was reacted at r.t. under catalyst-free conditions.
Almost negligible conversion occurred in this case despite continuing
the reaction for a prolonged duration, which underscored the significance
of a catalyst in tandem oxidative process (Table 1).

via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).

per mole of catalyst.

d TOF
= TON/h.

Next, we employed
different catalysts and checked their efficacy
in affording the target product. As anticipated, the use of only Fe3O4, SiO2@Fe3O4, and Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 resulted in
a very poor reaction conversion (Table 1, entries 2–4). On the other hand, when different
copper-based sources were used, the desired tandem product was obtained
with a good conversion. Among all of the tested catalytic sources,
the heterogeneous copper nanocatalyst undeniably exhibited the highest
conversion percentage.

We also evaluated the effect of catalyst
concentration on the model
reaction. To understand how this parameter affected the reaction profile,
we conducted six experiments, in which we simply increased the amount
of catalyst from 5 to 30 mg. The results revealed that an increase
in the amount of catalyst leads to an almost exponential rise in the
conversion percentage, which was primarily due to the subsequent increase
in the active sites of the nanoscale heterogeneous catalyst (Figure 6). The amount of
catalyst was optimized to 30 mg, as it was sufficient enough to result
in maximum conversion.

(1 mmol), benzylamine (2 mmol), Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst (x mg), H2O2 (3 equiv), I2 (1.2 equiv), DMF (3 mL), r.t., 3
h].

Subsequently, we focused our attention
toward optimizing the solvent.
Surprisingly, we found that the polarity of the solvents played a
critical role in determining the efficiency of the cascade process.
However, nonpolar solvents like toluene, acetonitrile, chloroform,
and tetrahydrofuran resulted in a poor conversion of reactants used:
a drastic increment was observed on switching the solvent from nonpolar
to polar (Figure 7).
DMF proved its prowess in this reaction, as the best results were
achieved in this case.

and 1,3-dicarbonyls [reaction conditions: methylacetoacetate (1 mmol),
benzylamine (2 mmol), Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst (30 mg), H2O2 (3 equiv), I2 (1.2 equiv), solvent (3 mL), r.t., 3 h].

Success of oxidative C(sp3)–H cascade reactions
is largely dependent on the efficiency of the employed oxidant. Thus,
in developing such protocols, it is very important to select the appropriate
oxidant, as a number of factors, such as versatility, expense, and
environmental impact, need to be addressed. Keeping this in mind,
we moved toward screening the most crucial parameter of the reaction,
that is, oxidant. For doing so, we investigated a wide array of oxidants.
The results of this screening experiment rather surprised us. Unlike
in most of the previously established protocols,11,12 where TBHP had proved to be an oxidant of choice, we found that
in our heterogeneously catalyzed protocol a greener oxidant, hydrogen
peroxide, which generates water as the sole byproduct, performed much
better, as 100% conversion was accomplished in this case. Oxidant
concentration also significantly affected the reaction conversion,
which is apparent from the results shown in Figure 8. We began the first set of experiment with
0.5 equiv of oxidant and found that only 30% conversion could be achieved
in this case. To accomplish better results, we increased the oxidant
concentration from 0.5 to 3 equiv. Ecstatically, a drastic improvement
in the results was observed as the conversion increased rapidly on
increasing oxidant equivalents and the best results were obtained
when 3 equiv of oxidant (H2O2) were used.

Figure 8 Effect of oxidant
and oxidant concentration on tandem oxidative
cyclization of amines and 1,3-dicarbonyls [reaction conditions: methylacetoacetate
(1 mmol), benzylamine (2 mmol), Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst (30 mg), oxidant (x equiv),
I2 (1.2 equiv), DMF (3 mL), r.t., 3 h].

Thereafter, to improve the reaction efficiency,
we introduced additives
into the reaction system. A thorough literature survey provided us
a clue that iodine-based compounds could enhance the overall conversion
of the concerned reaction, as they show impressive catalytic activity
in the formation of new C–C, C–O, and C–N bonds
in organic compounds because of their electrophilic properties.74,75 Hence, different iodine-based sources, such as potassium iodide (KI),
tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), N-Iodosuccinimide (NIS), and iodine
(I2), were investigated for this tandem oxidative cyclization
reaction (Table S1). To our delight, we
found that molecular I2, which has received considerable
attention76−78 in recent years as an inexpensive, environmentally
friendly, and readily available reagent to effect iodocyclization
and cyclodehydroiodination reactions, worked quite well as an additive
in this reaction, as it resulted in the maximum conversion of the
employed reactants. The optimization studies showed that the addition
of I2 was crucial for cyclizing the model substrates.

Finally, we modulated the reaction time and temperature and examined
the effects of these two crucial parameters on the synthesis of oxazoles.
The conversion percentages were plotted as a function of time and
temperature, and the results are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Effects of time and temperature on the tandem
oxidative cyclization
of amines and 1,3-dicarbonyls [reaction conditions: methylacetoacetate
(1 mmol), benzylamine (2 mmol), Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst (30 mg), H2O2 (3 equiv),
I2 (1.2 equiv), and DMF (3 mL)].

It was noted that although an increase in temperature incurred
lower reaction conversion, an increase in time period had a positive
impact on the reaction conversion. Notably, r.t. (25 °C) and
a time period of 3 h best suited the catalysis of this transformation
and thus the rest of the catalytic experiments were performed under
similar reaction conditions.

Under optimal oxidative conditions,
we set out to probe the viability
of this envisioned sequential catalytic protocol. For doing so, first
we investigated the scope of substituted β-ketoesters bearing
either alkyl or aromatic functional groups by reacting them with benzylamine
under the established reaction conditions. The results are shown in Scheme 2. In general, we
found that the corresponding oxazole products could be obtained with
a good conversion percentage and a high turnover number. However,
in case of bulky substituents, there was a slight decrease in the
conversion, which could be attributed to the steric effect (Scheme 2, 3c and 3f). Next, we switched over to β-diketone
and again found a profound decrease in the conversion, the reason
for which remained unclear (Scheme 2, 3g).

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope for the Reaction of
1,3-dicarbonyls with Benzylamines–
Reaction conditions: 1,3-dicarbonyl
(1 mmol), benzylamine (2 mmol), Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 (30 mg), H2O2 (3 equiv), I2 (1.2 equiv), DMF (3 mL), r.t.

Conversion percentages determined via GC-MS have been given in parentheses.

TON is the number of moles of the product per mole of
the catalyst.

To further explore the substrate
scope, we evaluated the scope
of benzylamine derivatives bearing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing
group (Scheme 3).

1,3-dicarbonyls–

equiv), I2 (1.2 equiv), DMF (3 mL), r.t.

Conversion percentages determined via GC-MS have been given in parentheses.

TON is the number of moles of the product
per mole of the catalyst.

Surprisingly and
quite unexpectedly, benzylamines possessing electron-donating
substituents on the aromatic ring (Scheme 3, 3h, 3k, and 3m) showed better reactivity, that is, higher conversion percentage
and turnover number, compared to those with electron-withdrawing substituents.
Further, to demonstrate the synthetic utility of this protocol, we
scaled up the model reaction to 50 mmol (Scheme S1). We were ecstatic to find that the conversion reached the
same level as when it was performed on a small scale, which clearly
illustrated the large-scale industrial applicability of this reaction.

2.3 Mechanism
To gain an insight into
the reaction mechanism, a few control experiments were performed (Scheme 4), whose results
revealed that the use of iodine, Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst, and oxidant is essential for the full
conversion of the reaction. Henceforth, on the basis of control experiments
and previous studies,11 a plausible reaction
mechanism was proposed for the tandem oxidative cyclization protocol
(Scheme 5). The first
step involves the interaction between HOI (resulting from the reaction
between I2 and H2O2) and enol tautomer 2b of the test substrate methylacetoacetate (2a), which leads to the formation of compound 4. In the
next step, nucleophilic attack of the NH2 group of the
benzylamine on the copper-coordinated iodo complex (5) generates compound 6, which is facilitated by the
removal of HI.

for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Oxazoles
Compound 6 so generated undergoes oxidation
in the
presence of H2O2 to form compound 7, which, in the presence of solid-supported copper catalyst, undergoes
an intramolecular cyclization, giving intermediate 9 in
a tandem process. Finally, oxidation of 9 affords the
desired oxazole product (3).

2.4 Catalytic
Activity Tests
2.4.1 Heterogeneity Test
To verify that
the observed catalysis was due to the synthesized magnetite-supported
copper nanocatalyst and not due to any leached metallic species, we
carried out a standard leaching experiment using the hot filtration
method reported in the literature.79 During
this test, the solid catalyst was removed from the reaction via magnetic
forces at about half the reaction time and the reaction conversion
was determined by GC–MS to be 62%. The resulting reaction mixture
was subjected to further stirring for a prolonged duration to rule
out any ambiguity due to shorter duration, and the reaction progress
was monitored continually using GC–MS. No increase in the conversion
percentage even after extended times proved the true heterogeneous
nature of the catalyst by excluding the possibility of leaching of
the active catalytic complex from the support. To further support
this observation, ICP analysis of the supernatant was conducted. Much
to our delight, we found that the copper content was less than the
detection limits. Thereafter, using this exactly small amount of copper,
independent homogeneous reactions were performed. No formation of
the desired product occurred, which meant no homogeneous catalysis
was involved. Also, UV–visible spectrum of the supernatant
was obtained and the results were studied carefully. No peak of copper
in this spectrum showed that the copper–BPy complex remained
tightly anchored to the silica-coated magnetite support, indicating
the stability of our synthesized catalyst.

2.4.2 Recyclability
Test
For developing an efficient green system, “ready isolation
and convenient recycling and reuse of catalyst” are highly
desirable from the viewpoint of large-scale industrial applicability.
Thus, in addition to the heterogeneity test, we checked the reusability
of the synthesized catalyst. To do so, we carried out repeated runs
of the model reaction using fresh reactants every time but on the
same batch of the catalyst. The results of these experiments are shown
in Figure 10. To regenerate
the catalyst, after each run, it was separated by means of external
magnetic attraction, washed several times with ethanol, and dried
under vacuum. It was observed that the catalyst could be reused at
least eight times without any appreciable loss of activity. This observation
was further supported by the SEM analysis of the recovered catalyst.
The SEM image of the recovered catalyst showed that the morphology
of the synthesized Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles remained intact, which provided a concrete proof of
the excellent durability of the catalyst (Figure S3).

and 1,3-dicarbonyls [reaction conditions: methylacetoacetate (1 mmol),
benzylamine (2 mmol), Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst (30 mg), H2O2 (3 equiv), I2 (1.2 equiv), DMF (3 mL), r.t., 3 h].

2.5 Comparison with Previous Studies
To shed light on the merit of the current protocol, a comparative
analogy on the activities of the fabricated magnetite-supported copper
nanocatalyst has been made with all of the previously reported methodologies
for the tandem oxidative cyclization of amines and 1,3-dicarbonyls.
Consequently, for drawing the best comparison, an in-depth analysis
of crucial reaction parameters associated with the synthesis of industrially
significant oxazoles has been carried out and factors such as reaction
yield and conditions have been focused upon. A close introspection
of the results clearly shows the superiority of our methodology (Table S2). The reactions yields are higher, and
the conditions are also green (use of a green oxidant, H2O2). Besides, unlike other methods that employ homogeneous
catalyst, our protocol uses a heterogeneous base metal nanocatalyst
that is magnetically retrievable and hence can overcome the problems
associated with catalyst separation and decomposition. Undoubtedly,
it is the overall simplicity (no electrolysis conditions required
unlike entries 3 and 4) and the economic competitiveness (owing to
exceptional catalytic reusability) of this synthetic route that render
it an appealing alternative to the literature precedents.

3 Conclusions
In the present study, we unveiled the fabrication
of a new heterogeneous
nanocatalyst possessing core–shell morphology for the synthesis
of polysubstituted oxazoles obtained via the tandem oxidative cyclization
approach. The catalyst is synthesized simply by the covalent immobilization
of a copper–BPy complex on a silica-encapsulated magnetite
nanosupport using inexpensive precursors under benign conditions.
Sophisticated physicochemical tools, such as WAXRD, HRTEM, SEM, EDX,
EDXRF, ICP, and FTIR analyses, have been employed for the structural
confirmation of the synthesized organic–inorganic hybrid nanocatalyst.
The efficacy of the synthesized Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst can be realized by focusing on the results
of various catalytic activity tests conducted, which include investigation
of substrate scope, hot filtration, and recyclability experiments.
This new methodology not only offers a convenient access to industrially
significant oxazoles with promising yield, but it is also operationally
facile and economically competitive compared with the literature precedents,
as it employs a catalyst that is magnetically retrievable, reusable
up to eight catalytic cycles, and highly durable. Besides, some of
the other advantages include high atom economy, excellent turnover
number, green reaction conditions (H2O2 as the
oxidant), and applicability to gram-scale synthesis. As this study
is based on the perfect combination of heterogeneous catalysis and
tandem oxidative cyclization, it provides a distinct advancement toward
the development of a sustainable approach for oxazole synthesis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals, Instrumentation,
and Analysis
All chemicals, reagents, and solvents for the
preparation of the
catalyst and target compounds were of analytical grade, procured from
commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless
specified. In particular, TEOS (99.9%), APTES (98%), and BPy were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka, and Alfa Aesar, respectively.
Ultrapure Milli-Q water was used throughout for the preparation of
all aqueous solutions. The entire oxidative cascade protocol was conducted
under ambient atmospheric conditions. For analytical and preparative
thin-layer chromatography (TLC), 0.2 mm (Merck) and 0.5 mm (Kieselgel
GF254) precoated plates were used, respectively. The spots were visualized
under UV light. In-depth characterization of the catalyst was carried
out using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, such
as FTIR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), TEM, FESEM, EDX, VSM, EDXRF,
X-ray photoelectron (XPS), and ICP analyses. FTIR spectra of the various
stages of the nanocatalyst/obtained nanocomposites were recorded on
a PerkinElmer Spectrum 2000 FTIR spectrometer (using the KBr pellet
method) in the operating range of 4000–400 cm–1 under atmospheric conditions with a resolution of 1 cm–1. PXRD patterns of the samples were collected with a Bruker D8 Advance
(Karlsruhe, Bundesland, Germany) diffractometer using Cu/Kα
radiation at a scanning rate of 4° min–1 in
the 2θ range of 5–80° (λ = 0.15405 nm, 40
kV, 40 mA). The magnetization measurements of the bare and coated
nanoparticles were performed at r.t. using a VSM (ADE-EV9; MicroSense)
in an applied magnetic field sweeping from −22 000 to
22 000 Oe. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
analysis was also accomplished to confirm the copper loading of the
catalyst using ICP-MS (model no.: 7700e). To carry out the microwave-assisted
digestion of the nanocatalyst, an Anton Paar Multiwave 3000 microwave
instrument equipped with a temperature and pressure sensor was used.
For studying the morphological characteristics (i.e., size, shape,
and composition), microscopic techniques such as TEM and SEM were
employed. The TEM images of the obtained nanocomposites were captured
by a transmission electron microscope JEOL 2100F. The sample for TEM
analysis was prepared by dispersing the nanoparticles in a high-purity
ethanol solution under ultrasonic irradiation, followed by placing
one drop of the suspended solution onto the TEM grid (copper grid
coated with carbon film) before drying at r.t. under ambient conditions.
On the other hand, a Tescan MIRA 3 FESEM instrument was employed for
FESEM and EDX imaging of the samples. Finally, for investigating the percentage conversion, GC–MS
analysis of all of the derived products was done using an Agilent
gas chromatograph (6850 GC) with HP-5MS 5% phenyl methyl siloxane
capillary column (30.0 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm)
and a quadrupole mass-filter-equipped 5975 mass-selective detector
using helium as the carrier gas (rate: 0.9 mL min–1).

4.2 Design and Synthesis of Nanocatalyst (Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4)
4.2.1 Synthesis
of Amine-Functionalized Silica-Encapsulated
Magnetite Nanosupport (Am-SiO2@Fe3O4)
At the outset, magnetite nanoparticles were prepared via
chemical coprecipitation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) salts in an ammoniacal
medium.67 In a typical procedure, 6.0 g
of ferric sulfate and 4.2 g of ferrous sulfate were dissolved well
in ultrapure water (250 mL) and stirred at 60 °C. A yellow-orange
solution was obtained once the Fe (II) and Fe (III) salts dissolved
completely in water. Thereafter, 15 mL of 25% NH4OH was
added dropwise into the reaction solution until the pH of the solution
reached 10. The resulting solution was stirred continuously and vigorously
for 1 h. The obtained black precipitate of Fe3O4 nanoparticles were separated using an external magnet, washed thoroughly
with water and ethanol several times, and dried under vaccum. Next,
the dried Fe3O4 nanoparticles were coated with
silica using the modified sol–gel approach.68 TEOS was used as the silica precursor for the coating process.
This step was carried out by first dispersing Fe3O4 nanoparticles in ethanol under ultrasonic irradiation for
1 h. Subsequently, to the dispersed nanoparticles, 6 mL of ammonia
and 2 mL of TEOS were added. This reaction mixture was stirred incessantly
under atmospheric conditions for about 24 h. The synthesized SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles were isolated again
using magnetic attraction, washed well with ethanol, and dried under
vacuum. After the silica-coating process, amine groups were introduced
onto the surface of the SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles using APTES as the functionalizing agent.69 For this functionalization step, 5 mL of APTES
was added to 1.0 g of SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles
ultrasonically dispersed in 200 mL of ethanol solution and the resultant
mixture was stirred for 24 h at r.t. The amine-functionalized nanocomposites
(Am-SiO2@Fe3O4) thus obtained were
separated magnetically, washed many times with ethanol, and ultimately
dried under vacuum.

4.2.2 Synthesis of the Nanocatalyst
(Cu-BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4)
The
last stage of catalyst
preparation involved two important steps: (1) covalent grafting of
ligand and (2) metallation. The ligand-grafting process was carried
out by refluxing 2 g of Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles with BPy (4 mmol, 0.736 g) in ethanol for 10 h.70 The ligand-grafted nanoparticles (BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4) so obtained were separated by
magnetic attraction, washed well with ethanol at least three times
to remove any unreacted ligand, and oven-dried for 10 h. Subsequently,
1.0 g of BPy@Am-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles
was reacted with 1.5 mmol of copper acetate for 6 h in absolute ethanol
at r.t. for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the
metallated nanoparticles were washed thoroughly with ethanol and dried
in an oven for 2 h to obtain the final nanocatalyst (Scheme 1).

4.3 General Catalytic Procedure for the Synthesis
of Polysubstituted Oxazoles via the Tandem Oxidative Cyclization Approach
To a reaction vessel containing benzylamine derivatives (2 mmol)
in DMF (3 mL), iodine (1.2 equiv), 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds (1 mmol),
catalyst (30 mg), and H2O2 (3 equiv) were added
successively. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at r.t. for
an appropriate period of time, and the progress of the reaction was
monitored via TLC. After the reaction, the catalyst was separated
simply using an external bar magnet and the reaction contents were
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, dried
over solid anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated. Finally, the
products were confirmed through the GC–MS technique.
