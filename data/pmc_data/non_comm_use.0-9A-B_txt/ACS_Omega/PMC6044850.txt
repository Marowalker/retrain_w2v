Synthetic polymer-based antimicrobial
materials destroy conventional
antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Although these antibacterial
polymers imitate the properties of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs),
their effect on bacterial cell morphology has not been studied in
detail. To investigate the morphology change of a bacterial cell in
the presence of antimicrobial polymer, herein we have designed and
synthesized side-chain amino acid-based cationic polymers, which showed
efficient antibacterial activity against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli), as well as Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Morphological switching
from a rod shape to a spherical shape of E. coli cells was observed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy
analysis due to cell wall disruption, whereas the B.
subtilis cell structure and size remained intact,
but stacks of the cells formed after polymer treatment. The zone of
inhibition experiment on an agar plate for E. coli cells exhibited drastic morphological changes at the vicinity of
the polymer-treated portion and somewhat less of an effect at the
periphery of the plate.

Introduction
Multidrug-resistant
pathogenic microorganisms have created a serious
problem in the medical sciences.1,2 They cannot be destroyed
by conventional antibiotics and cause several diseases and infections
in humans.3,4Escherichia coli XL10 (E. coli XL10) is a well-known
Gram-negative bacterium, and is such a multidrug-resistant microorganism
that causes half of the infections in humans.5 Recently, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)6,7 have
been considered as a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics.8 Antibiotics preserve the bacterial cell morphology,
whereas AMPs efficiently show bactericidal properties by physically
disrupting the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane instead of targeting
mammalian cells.9,10 They attack the bacterial cell
membrane directly, and the disruption is mediated by forming electrostatic
interactions between the cationic charge of the AMPs and anionic charge
of the phosphate headgroups on the membrane surface, which in turn
disrupt the membrane by insertion of hydrophobic components into the
plasma membrane.11,12 AMPs selectivity attack microorganisms
over mammalian cells as zwitterionic phospholipids provide a net neutral
charge on the surface of mammalian cells.13,14

Currently, an alternative approach to develop new antimicrobial
agents utilizing synthetic polymer chemistry has become popular due
to the difficulty and cost of large scale synthesis of AMPs, and also
the rapid degradation of AMPs by the protease enzyme inside the human
body.15,16 Different classes of polymers such as polyethers,17 polycarbonates,18 polymethacrylates,19 polynorbornenes,20 poly-β-lactams,21 and so forth, have been synthesized as AMP mimics. When designing
antimicrobial polymers,22 sufficient cationic
charge has to be incorporated into the macromolecule to undergo electrostatic
adhesion to the negatively charged microbial cell wall. Further, introduction
of a hydrophobic moiety into the polymeric system can lead to disruption
of the cellular membrane.23,24

Recently, the
antimicrobial efficacy of cationic or hydrophobic
polymeric substances and their cell penetration have been investigated
extensively.25,26 For example, Haldar and co-workers
studied the antibacterial properties of novel hydrolyzable cationic
amphiphiles bearing one, two, and three trimethylammonium headgroups
and pyridinium headgroups and observed that the incorporation of multiple
headgroups led to improved antibacterial activity.27 Their group developed a set of cationic dimeric amphiphiles
(bearing cleavable amide linkages between the head group and the hydrocarbon
tail with different methylene spacers) with high antibacterial activity
against human pathogenic bacteria (E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and low
cytotoxicity.4 Interaction of cationic
amphiphiles with the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane and
disruption of the bacterial membrane leading to cell death were observed
by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and fluorescence
spectroscopy. Zhou et al. investigated the selective antibacterial
activities and action mechanism of oligomeric surfactants bearing
amide moieties through isothermal titration microcalorimetry, SEM
and zeta potential measurements.9 A very
recent investigation on polypeptide-based macroporous cryogels, prepared
through a polycationic polylysine-b-polyvaline block
copolymer with glutaraldehyde as the cross-linker under cryogenic
conditions showed inherent antimicrobial properties.28 The key findings were a 95.6% reduction of viable E. coli cells after a brief 1 h incubation and a
very interesting “trap and kill” mechanism due to the
macroporous structure of the cryogels. Chen et al. investigated a
quantitative cell wall disruption mechanism, similar to AMPs, through
analyzing the interaction between lipid bilayers acting as a model
for a cellular membrane with synthetic antimicrobial polymers by sum
frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy.29 Recently, the design of antimicrobial polymers has been
extended to the use of primary ammonium groups to mimic the amphiphilic
property and cationic functionality of natural AMPs.30,31

Although significant progress has been made in the area of
cationic
antibacterial polymers, very little attention has been paid to the
morphological switching of the bacterial cell. Therefore, we became
interested in investigating the morphological switching of Gram-negative
bacteria (E. coli) during side-chain
amino acid-based cationic polymer treatment. To further our investigation,
we studied the effect of these compounds on Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. The double membrane
structures of E. coli (Gram-negative
bacterium) are well established.32,33 According
to this model, the cell membrane is more difficult to disrupt compared
to the single membrane structure of B. subtilis (Gram-positive bacterium).34 However, B. subtilis has a very thick outer cell wall composed
of a negatively charged peptidoglycan layer (polysaccharide with amino
acid side chains), whereas E. coli has
a thin peptidoglycan layer sandwiched between the outer and inner
membrane (IM) composed of lipopolysaccharide.35 Because of the difference in cell wall structure, the cell penetration
ability of any antimicrobial polymer for two different types of bacteria
should be different. In Gram-positive bacteria, the antimicrobial
polymer rather easily interacts with the loosely packed porous peptidoglycan
layer and attacks the inner cytoplasmic membrane, whereas for Gram-negative
bacteria, the additional outer membrane (OM) protects the IM to some
extent.34 Hence, the cell wall penetration
ability of any antimicrobial agent is expected to be greater in the
case of Gram-positive bacteria than for that of Gram-negative bacteria.36 To understand this, three homopolymers with
controlled molecular weight and narrow dispersity, composed of alanine,
leucine, and phenylalanine-based monomers, and two block copolymers
with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether
methacrylate (PEGMA) using an alanine-based macro chain transfer agent
(CTA) were prepared via reversible addition–fragmentation chain
transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Herein, we selected side-chain amino
acid-based polymers due to their biocompatibility and cationic nature.37,38 The antimicrobial effect was more prominent with increasing hydrophobicity
of the −R group of the amino acid-based cationic
homopolymers and correlated with their cell penetrating ability. The
drastic switching (rod shape to spherical shape) of cell morphology
of the polymer-treated bacterial cell was observed using FESEM analysis
and the Gram staining approach, and was most conspicuous at the vicinity
of the polymer-treated region. Cell death resulting from cell membrane
disruption and stacking of cells was observed by FESEM and the Gram
staining approach. The antimicrobial effect of the above polymers
on Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive
(B. subtilis) bacterial cell morphology
was investigated systematically with distance from the zone of inhibition.
A mechanism of cell morphology switching for Gram-negative bacteria
is proposed in the presence of side-chain amino acid-based cationic
polymers.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Side-Chain Amino Acid-Based
Homopolymers and Block
Copolymers
Side-chain amino acid containing methacrylate
monomers (Boc-AA-HEMA, Scheme 1, AA = amino acid, i.e., alanine (Ala) or leucine (Leu) or
phenylalanine (Phe)) were polymerized via the RAFT technique in dimethylformamide
(DMF) at 70 °C using AIBN as the radical initiator and CDP as
CTA (Scheme 1) at a
constant Boc-AA-HEMA to CDP to AIBN ratio of [Boc-AA-HEMA]/[CDP]/[AIBN]
= 25:1:0.1 (Table 1). For the polymer synthesis, we used the RAFT technique to obtain
polymers with controlled molecular weight, narrow dispersity (Đ), and defined chain ends. The gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) refractive index (RI) traces for all of the homopolymers (P(Boc-AA-HEMA))
indicate a unimodal distribution (Figure S1). Number-average molecular weights (Mn,GPC) and Đ values (1.10–1.18) were determined
from the GPC analysis and the results are shown in Table 1. P(Boc-AA-HEMA) was characterized
by 1H NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3 (Figures S2–S4). Typical resonance signals
for the different protons in the repeating unit of the polymer are
assigned on the spectrum. The number-average degree of polymerization
(DPn) for P(Boc-Ala-HEMA) was determined by comparing the
integration areas of the signals at 4.1–4.5 ppm from the Boc-Ala-HEMA
repeating unit (5H from O—CH2—CH2—O— and chiral proton) in the
main chain of P(Boc-Ala-HEMA) and at 2.4–2.6 ppm from the terminal
—CH2—CH2— protons (4H) from the HOOC—CH2—CH2—C(CN)(CH3)— chain ends (Figure S2A). The DPn values of the other two homopolymers, P(Boc-Leu-HEMA)
and P(Boc-Phe-HEMA), were also determined from NMR signal comparison.
The DPn of each polymer is denoted by subscripts; for example,
P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)14 represents the homopolymer of Boc-Ala-HEMA
with DPn = 14. From the NMR chain-end analysis,42 the molecular weights (Mn,NMR) were determined (Table 1). Also, Table 1 summarizes the theoretical molecular weight (Mn,theo) values, which were calculated based on conversion
(Conv.) for different homopolymers using the equation: Mn,theo = (([monomer]/[CDP] × average molecular weight
(MW) of monomer × conversion) + (MW of CDP)). A nice agreement
between Mn,theo, Mn,GPC, and Mn,NMR is observed in Table 1, thus indicating
that we have used well-defined polymers for further study.

Next, PEGMA and MMA were polymerized using P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-macro-CTA
at a constant ratio of [monomer (M)]/[CTA]/[AIBN] = 50/1/0.1 in DMF
at 70 °C for 5 h to synthesize the P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-b-PPEGMA and P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-b-PMMA block copolymers,
respectively. These block copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3 (Figures S5 and S6). Comparison of the integration areas from the terminal
group at 2.4–2.6 ppm and side-chain —OCH3 protons in the PPEGMA block at 3.38 ppm allowed calculation
of DPn for the PPEGMA segment (Figure S5A). Similarly, the DPn of the PMMA block in the
P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-b-PMMA block copolymer was determined
by comparing the integration areas at 2.4–2.6 ppm and side-chain
—OCH3 protons at 3.6 ppm from the
MMA units (Figure S6A). The DPn of each block is denoted by the subscripts after each block abbreviation;
for example, P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)14-b-PPEGMA60 represents the block copolymer, which consists of a P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)
block of DPn = 14 and PPEGMA block of DPn =
60. The Mn,NMR values of the block copolymers
were also determined by NMR chain-end analysis (Table 1) using the following equation: Mn,NMR = [(DPn,PEGMA/MMA × MPEGMA/MMA) + molecular weight of P(Boc-Ala-HEMA) macro-CTA],
where DPn and M are the number-average
degree of polymerization of the PPEGMA/PMMA segment and molecular
weight of the PEGMA/MMA monomer, respectively. Unimodal GPC RI traces
of the block copolymers were shifted toward higher molecular weight
(lower elution volume) with respect to P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)14 (Figure S1). The Mn,GPC, Đ, and Mn,theo values of all block copolymers are summarized in Table 1.

Incorporation
of cationic charge into our amino acid-based polymers
is an essential requirement for good antimicrobial activity via bacterial
negatively charged cell wall disruption through electrostatic interaction.43,44 To instill cationic charges into the polymers, deprotection of the
side-chain Boc groups from the Boc-protected homopolymers and block
copolymers was achieved by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at room temperature
(Scheme 1). Successful
deprotection was proven by the disappearance of Boc proton signals
at around 1.44 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum (Figures S2–S6). The —NH2 signal was lost in the 1H NMR spectrum because these
protons are exchangeable with the surrounding deuterated solvent (D2O). After deprotection, the homopolymers (P(AA-HEMA)) and
block copolymers (P(Ala-HEMA)-b-PPEGMA/PMMA) were
soluble in aqueous media as the —NH2 group of the
side chain becomes —NH3+ in an acid medium.
The aqueous solubility test was performed for all of the five polymers
after deprotection (Scheme S1), wherein
each of the polymer solution concentrations was 10 g/L (Table S1). Thus, cationic charge was introduced
into our polymers, and this was already proved by our group through
the measurement of zeta potential.45,46

Antibacterial
Activity against E. coli
Cationic
amphiphilic copolymers have long attracted significant
attention from the scientific community due to their capability to
control bacterial growth in solution and on surfaces by a mechanism
involving the disruption of bacterial cytoplasmic membranes.47 Alkyl quaternary ammonium groups have been widely
used as cationic groups, and are likely responsible for polymer binding
to bacteria and membrane disruption imitating the mechanism of AMPs.48 Polymers containing cationic pendent primary
ammonium groups on the side chain exhibiting higher antimicrobial
efficacy have been reported,16,36 as primary ammonium
group bearing polymers can extensively imitate the amphiphilic properties
and cationic functionalities of AMPs.49,50 Our amino
acid-based polymers also contain cationic primary amine groups at
their side chain, hence we expected to observe antimicrobial activity
with these cationic polymers. Also, they are biocompatible and noncytoxic,
which has been previously reported by our group.51 Thus, the bacterial growth inhibitory properties of our
side-chain amino acid-based cationic polymers was proven by the zone
of inhibition method. Three homopolymers and two block copolymers
were tested against a Gram-negative bacterium (E. coli) at volumes of 50, 100, and 200 μL from an initial stock of
10 mg/mL (Figure S7). One schematic representation
of a petriplate is shown in Figure S8 for
further clarification about the inhibition zone. A clear zone of inhibition
was observed for the three homopolymers, which indicates a strong
bacterial growth inhibitory effect. Such antibacterial properties
do not appear to be prominent when both the block copolymers were
tested after 12 h incubation (Figures 1 and S7, where the circled
portion of the figure indicates the zone of inhibition). This could
be due to the different hydrophobicity and less positive charges in
the block copolymer systems. In addition to electrostatic interactions,
the effect of the hydrophobicity of a polymer on the antimicrobial
activity is well reported.52,53 Many research groups
have already proposed the insertion of hydrophobic substituents into
the bacterial cell membrane that could cause leakage of the cytoplasm
causing cell death.54,55 Hence, in addition to electrostatic
interactions, more hydrophobicity could result in better antimicrobial
activity. Conversely, introduction of a small mol % of hydrophilic
PEGMA into poly(vinylpyridine) was reported to improve the antimicrobial
efficacy due to enhancement of the surface wettability of the hydrophobic
copolymer.56 In our case, the polymers
were already soluble in aqueous media, hence PEGMA could not affect
the water solubility and surface wettability. Addition of a sufficiently
large hydrophilic PPEGMA60 block to the P(Ala-HEMA)14 segment may have caused the decrease in hydrophobicity leading
to the lower cell penetration efficiency of P(Ala-HEMA)14-b-PPEGMA60 compared to that of the P(Ala-HEMA)14 homopolymer, leading to a lower antimicrobial efficiency
of the resulting block copolymer. However, despite the hydrophobicity
of the PMMA block, the resulting block copolymer P(Ala-HEMA)14-b-PMMA37 showed a lower antibacterial
efficiency compared to that of the pure homopolymer. This could be
due to the amphiphilic balance of antimicrobial polymers, which is
an important parameter that controls antimicrobial activities.57,58 It is most likely that P(Ala-HEMA)14-b-PMMA37 formed a micelle,42 and as a result, the hydrophobic PMMA segments became unavailable
for interaction with the lipid membranes of the bacteria. Thus, the
aggregation of P(Ala-HEMA)14-b-PMMA37 in solution prevented its antimicrobial efficiency.59

coli treatment: (A) control (without polymer), (B)

(H) P(Leu-HEMA)15, and (I) P(Phe-HEMA)10. Bacterial
growth is not inhibited in control disk in the absence of polymer,
but when the disk was loaded with polymer, the inhibition zone was
prominent for three homopolymers and expanded with increasing concentration
of the polymer solution, on the contrary, no clear inhibitory effect
of the two block copolymers was observed. Each experiment was run
in duplicate.

Table 2 provides
the quantitative data of the area of zone of inhibition for the three
homopolymers. The hydrophobic effect of the side-chain −R group of the amino acid-based polymer on bacterial growth
inhibition is observed here. P(Ala-HEMA)14, P(Leu-HEMA)15, and P(Phe-HEMA)10 have methyl, isopropyl, and
benzyl as their −R group, respectively. Isopropyl
and benzyl are more hydrophobic compared to the methyl group resulting
in greater cell wall penetration ability. Hence, a greater area of
zone of inhibition for P(Leu-HEMA)15 and P(Phe-HEMA)10 is observed compared to that of P(Ala-HEMA)14 (Table 2).

Additional evidence of the bacterial growth inhibitory efficacy
of our polymer was obtained by performing the Minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) experiment with P(Leu-HEMA)15 on E.
coli cells. The MIC value was determined as 60 μg/mL,
which is quite impressive compared to that of some other reported
cationic antimicrobial polymers that exhibit high MIC values.16,36 Hence, we can comment that our polymer is much more efficient as
an antimicrobial agent compared to several reported cationic antibacterial
polymers.

In the next stage, Gram staining was performed only
with the homopolymer-treated
bacterial cell which gave a prominent zone of inhibition compared
to that of the two block copolymers. Gram staining was performed with
cells from the close vicinity of the homopolymer-treated region and
from the periphery of the agar plate, which showed the effect of polymer
treatment on the bacterial cell morphology (Figure 2). The polymer-treated cells were found to
be clustered to each other in comparison to the normal bacterial cell,
though the individual cell morphology was very difficult to interpret
based on optical microscopy images. This observation is most prominent
in the case of the P(Leu-HEMA)15-treated bacterial cells
from within the zone of inhibition (Figure 2). Upon polymer treatment, retention of crystal
violet (CV) within the bacterial cells is another interesting observation
(Figure 2). The general
mechanism of Gram staining allows for positively charged CV molecules
to passively disperse into the cell and electrostatically bind to
available anionic surfaces. Introduction of a mordant (typically a
solution of iodine and potassium iodide) allows it to react with cationic
CV, producing a CV–mordant precipitate. Cells were washed with
an alcohol to remove the primary stain (i.e., decolorization) followed
by counter staining (typically using the red dye, safranin O). However,
during antimicrobial polymer treatment, the cytoplasm leaked out into
the periplasmic space due to cell membrane disruption and interacted
with the primary stain to some extent leading to retention of the
color.

(B) control (100× resolution), (C) treated with P(Ala-HEMA)14 within the zone of inhibition (100× resolution), (D)

(G) treated with P(Phe-HEMA)10 within the zone of inhibition
(100× resolution), and (H) treated with P(Phe-HEMA)10 away from the zone of inhibition (100× resolution). Polymer-treated
bacterial cells appear to be stacked and CV color is retained in the
vicinity of the zone of inhibition and the effect becomes less prominent
with increasing distance from the inhibitory zone.

Individual cell morphology was observed by FESEM
(Figure 3). Imaging
was performed with
the three homopolymer-treated bacterial cells from the near and far
areas of the zone of inhibition. A morphological change of the bacteria
after incubation with poly(ionic liquid) membranes has been reported,
where aggregation of lipid vesicles and collapsed cell walls on the
membrane surface were the crucial observations.55 Bacterial cellular morphology in the presence of complex
natural products with antibacterial activity, such as honey, has been
investigated, wherein the cell morphology was analyzed during lag-
and log-phase growth; and cell shape transformation (length or width),
cell lysis (breakage of cells or leakage of cytoplasm indicating cell
envelope or growth abnormalities), and detection of chromosomal DNA
abnormalities by DAPI staining were the crucial observations.60 Bacterial cell morphology was also investigated
upon treatment with Tween20, heparin, and disodium tetraborate.61 Further, the morphological investigation of E. coli cells after the destructive extraction of
phospholipids from the peptidoglycan layer by graphene nanosheets
through transmission electron microscopy has been reported.62 Our observation was exclusively different, as
the polymer-treated cells appeared to be spherical compared to the
rod shape of the control cells. In addition to the peptidoglycan wall,
the actin-like MreB protein and several membrane proteins interacting
with MreB are essential for the production and preservation of the
rod shape morphology of bacteria, and MreB has an extended-filament
architecture whose localization, in turn, may affect the shape of
the cell wall, causing the rod to spherical transformation.63 The morphological switching is prominent in
close vicinity of the polymer-treated region. The effect becomes less
prominent at regions further away from the zone of inhibition, but
the switching characteristics were still observed to some extent.
The smooth cell membrane of untreated bacteria was preserved whereas
the presence of a corrugated cell surface and debris of polymer-treated
cells suggests that polymers show antibacterial activity through a
membrane disruption mechanism (Figure 3E,G). The E. coli cell
consists of an OM and IM, which are separated by a cross-linked porous
peptidoglycan layer. The surface of E. coli is negatively charged, and mainly consists of lipopolysaccharides
and anionic phospholipids of the OM.64 The
cationic polymer may first interact with the negatively charged OM
disrupting it through electrostatic interactions thereby penetrating
the peptidoglycan mesh. It then interacts with the inner cell membrane
through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Disruption of
the cell membrane results in the leakage of cytoplasm which causes
cell death. During this cell disruption process, the morphological
switching observed here could be a possibility (Figure 3F–H). The best variation is observed
for the P(Leu-HEMA)15 treated cells. This is may be due
to the greater cell penetration ability of this polymer compared to
that of the others, as the hydrophobicity of the side-chain isopropyl
group could play an important role in cell penetration. Another interesting
observation was the decrease in bacterial cell size upon polymer treatment
(less than 1 μm), indicating E. coli may not be able to grow to the maximum length during treatment (Figure 3D,E,H).

treated with P(Ala-HEMA)14 within the zone of inhibition,
stacking of cells was observed, (C) treated with P(Ala-HEMA)14 away from the zone of inhibition, presence of corrugated cell surface
was found, (D) treated with P(Leu-HEMA)15 within the zone
of inhibition, the cells were stacked through leakage of cytoplast
and a spherical morphology appeared, (E) treated with P(Leu-HEMA)15 away from the zone of inhibition, spherical cells and cell
debris were observed, (F) treated with P(Phe-HEMA)10 within
the zone of inhibition, cleavage of bacterial cell was found during

zone of inhibition, debris of polymer-treated cells appeared, and
(H) treated with P(Leu-HEMA)15 at the vicinity of polymer-treated
region, bacterial cells appear as spherical.

As an efficient bacterial growth inhibitory property of side-chain
amino acid-based homopolymers in solid media has been established
by the above experiments, their efficacy in preventing bacterial growth
in liquid media was studied next to verify whether these polymers
show efficient antimicrobial properties in liquid media. Luria Broth
(LB) was used as the liquid media. The experiment was performed with
only P(Leu-HEMA)15 treatment as this polymer gave the best
morphological switching of the bacterial cells. The OD600 value of the bacterial culture with P(Leu-HEMA)15 was
recorded at different time intervals and plotted against time, and
showed no exponential enhancement curve (Figure 4). In comparison, exponential cell growth
was observed in the flask without the polymer. The absence of the
exponential enhancement curve indicates that the polymer prevents
the growth of bacterial cells.

Figure 4 Growth curve of E. coli cells in
LB media in the presence and absence of P(Leu-HEMA)15.
For the control experiment, where the polymer was absent, exponential
cell growth was observed, and this was absent in the presence of the
polymer.

Gram staining results (Figure S9) with
each fraction of P(Leu-HEMA)15-treated bacterial culture
at 1 h time intervals show retention of the primary stain color to
some extent. The observation is not so clear because of the smaller
cell size. Again, the population of bacteria was found to be much
lower compared to that of the control (bacterial culture without polymer)
during Gram staining after 12 h incubation (Figure S9), which confirms the bacterial growth inhibitory effect
in a liquid medium. The bacterial cell morphology in LB media due
to polymer treatment was investigated by FESEM analysis (Figure 5). Distinct morphological
switching, as was observed in solid media, is not observed here. However,
a sheetlike structure (Figure 5C) and stacking of the cells (Figure 5D) are the crucial observations of this experiment
after 7 h incubation, when cell growth was completely prevented, and
indicate cell death had occurred.

growth in LB media: control (without P(Leu-HEMA)15 polymer)

cell area, where cell size and morphology were intact; P(Leu-HEMA)15 treated cell images from (C) congested cell area (sheetlike

h incubation.

The Gram-negative bacterial
cell wall is composed of the OM, intermediate
peptidoglycan layer, and IM. The cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli is rich in phosphatidylethanolamine and anionic
phosphatidylgylcerol lipids, which are present in a roughly 4:1 ratio.65 Our polymers exhibited bacterial killing efficacy
due to the presence of the cationic pendent primary amine groups and
hydrophobic −R group (methyl, isopropyl, and
benzyl) at their side chains. This is the major structural difference
from other non-antimicrobial polymers. The molecular mechanisms of
membrane binding and bacterial cell disruption by cationic amphiphilic
polymer were reported earlier by flourometric assay.66 The polymer-induced leakage of small dye molecules from
liposomes, lipid vesicles synthesized mimicking the phospholipid composition
of a bacterial cell, was the reported procedure to quantify the membrane
permeability of the polymers.67 On the
basis of these earlier reports, a possible mechanism of morphological
switching of the Gram-negative bacterial cell is summarized in Figure 6. In step 1, the
positively charged polymer destroys the negatively charged OM of the
bacterial cell wall through electrostatic interactions. The peptidoglycan
layer consists of pores called a peptidiglycan mesh. In step 2, the
cationic polymer, especially the hydrophobic group, crosses the peptidoglycan
layer through the peptidoglycan mesh and interacts with the IM causing
disruption via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions leading
to cytoplasm leakage. The cell wall disruption proceeds through a
cleavable intermediate morphological variation (Figure 3F). In step 3, bacterial cell morphology
completely switches from a rod shape to a spherical shape during treatment
with the antibacterial cationic polymer (Figure 3H).

Figure 6 Step 1: positively charged polymer disrupts
the OM of Gram-negative
bacterial cell wall through electrostatic interactions. Step 2: polymer
penetrates the intermediate peptidoglycan layer and interacts with
the IM through cleavable intermediate morphological variation. Step
3: total morphological switching of bacterial cell from rod shape
to spherical shape with destruction of inner cell membrane.

Antibacterial Activity
against B. subtilis
In the
next stage, the antimicrobial activity of our cationic
polymers on a Gram-positive bacterium (B. subtilis) is investigated by the zone of inhibition method. The experiment
was performed only with P(Leu-HEMA)15 at three different
volumes of 50, 100, and 200 μL from an initial 10 mg/mL stock
solution (Figure 7).
After 12 h incubation, no inhibition zone was observed on treatment
with the 50 μL polymer solutions, whereas a very clear inhibition
zone was noticed when treated with 100 and 200 μL of polymer
solutions (Figure 7). However, the inhibitory effect is localized and the area of zone
of inhibition increases with increasing concentration of P(Leu-HEMA)15 solution (Figure 7 and Table 3). The quantitative values of area of zone of inhibition (Table 3) indicate a lower
antibacterial activity of P(Leu-HEMA)15 on B. subtilis compared to that on E.
coli at equivalent concentrations of polymer solution
treatment. The explanation for this is based on the variation of cell
wall structure of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For
Gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is more anionic and hydrophilic
compared to that of the Gram-positive one,68 hence leading to stronger electrostatic interactions between the
anionic cell wall and cationic P(Leu-HEMA)15.

at (C) 50 μL, (D) 100 μL, and (E) 200 μL from 10
mg/mL stock solution. Inhibitory effect is localized and area of zone
of inhibition increases with increasing concentration of P(Leu-HEMA)15 solution. Each experiment was run in duplicate.

The effect of P(Leu-HEMA)15 on cell morphology was analyzed
by Gram staining (Figure S10) and FESEM
(Figure 8). B. subtilis has a very thick outer cell wall composed
of a negatively charged peptidoglycan layer (polysaccharide with amino
acid side chains) and inner cytoplasmic membrane. However, during
polymer treatment, stacking of cells was observed, although the overall
cell morphology and average cell length remain unchanged. The fusion
of the cell membrane results in an assemblage of lipid vesicles, hence
causing surface collapse in the Gram-positive bacterial cells (B. subtilis).

treatment, stacking of cells was observed, although overall cell morphology
and average cell length remain unchanged from control set.

Conclusions
Side-chain amino acid-based
cationic polymers with pendant alanine,
leucine, and phenylalanine moieties showed efficient antibacterial
activity on both Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (B. subtilis)
bacteria. Considerable switching of bacterial cell morphology from
a rod shape to a spherical shape was clearly observed through FESEM
analysis during polymer treatment of E. coli cells. The most prominent effect was observed for treatment of E. coli cells with the leucine-based cationic homopolymer,
whereas B. subtilis cells did not show
any drastic morphological change. Stacking of cells was observed in
the cases of E. coli and B. subtilis. During polymeric treatment, sometimes
the E. coli cells could not grow to
the maximum bacterial length due to the harsh polymeric environment;
the effect is most obvious at the vicinity of the polymer-treated
region; however it was also observed to some extent far away from
the inhibitory zone. With increasing distance from the polymer-treated
region on the petriplate, the morphology switching effect is lower,
as expected. Such a widespread effect is absent in the case of B. subtilis, although the bacterial growth inhibition
zone is more clear compared to that for E. coli at the vicinity of the polymer on the petriplates. Thus, the area
of zone of inhibition for E. coli is
larger than that for B. subtilis. Therefore,
we can conclude that for Gram-negative bacteria the polymer has a
more spread-out antibacterial effect through morphological switching,
whereas in the case of Gram-positive bacteria, the effect is very
clear and localized with indiscrete bacterial cell morphology and
cell size.

methacryloyloxyethyl ester (Boc-Phe-HEMA), and 4-cyano-4-(dodecylsulfanylthiocarbonyl)sulfanylpentanoic
acid (CDP)40 as CTA were synthesized by
previously reported procedures. The solvents, such as hexanes (mixture
of isomers), acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), and so forth, were purified
by standard procedures. Agar, tryptone, sodium chloride (NaCl), and
yeast extract were obtained from Merck, India. Petriplates were obtained
from Tarsons Products Pvt. Ltd., India. Phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) tablets were received from Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q filtered water
was used to prepare solutions and autoclaved before using. The bacterial
stains used for experiments were E. coli XL10 (E. coli) and B. subtilis.

Instrumentation
GPC measurements were conducted in
tetrahydrofuran at 30 °C with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min (equipped
with a Waters Model 515 HPLC pump, one PolarGel-M guard column, and
two PolarGel-M analytical columns (300 × 7.5 mm2)).
Detection consisted of a Waters Model 2414 RI detector. Narrow molecular
weight poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) standards (Mp values ranging from 1280 to 199 000 g/mol) were
used to calibrate the GPC system. NMR spectra were acquired in a Bruker
AvanceIII 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. Gram staining
images of bacteria were taken using an optical microscope at 40×
and 100× resolution before and after polymer treatment. Optical
density (OD) measurements of bacterial solutions with and without
polymer at 600 nm (OD600) were performed using a Hitachi
U2900 spectrometer.

Synthesis of Homopolymers
A typical
polymerization
procedure is described as follows: Boc-Ala-HEMA (1.0 g, 3.3 mmol),
CDP (53.6 mg, 0.13 mmol), AIBN (2.13 mg, 13.0 μmol; 1.06 g stock
solution of 4.0 mg AIBN in 2.0 g DMF), and DMF (2.9 g) were sealed
in a 20 mL vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The vial was purged
with dry N2 for 20 min and was placed in a preheated reaction
block at 70 °C. The polymerization reaction was quenched by cooling
the vial in an ice–water bath and exposing the solution to
air after 5 h. The solution was diluted with acetone and precipitated
into cold hexanes. The polymer, P(Boc-Ala-HEMA), was reprecipitated
four times from acetone/hexanes and dried under vacuum at 40 °C
for 6 h. Similarly, Boc-Leu-HEMA and Boc-Phe-HEMA were polymerized
to obtain the corresponding polymers P(Boc-Leu-HEMA) and P(Boc-Phe-HEMA),
respectively. The purified polymers were isolated as yellowish white
powders.

Synthesis of Block Copolymers
A typical block copolymerization
procedure is described as follows: PEGMA (0.45 g, 1.50 mmol), P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-macro-CTA
(Mn,GPC = 3900 g/mol, dispersity (Đ) = 1.10, 100 mg, 0.03 mmol), AIBN (0.49 mg, 3.0
μmol; 0.25 g stock solution of 4.0 mg AIBN in 2.0 g DMF), and
DMF (1.0 g) were added to a 20 mL polymerization vial equipped with
a magnetic bar and purged with dry N2 gas for 15 min. The
reaction vial was put in a preheated reaction block at 70 °C
for 5 h. The resulting block copolymer, P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-b-PPEGMA, was purified as mentioned above for the homopolymer. Another
block copolymer, P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-b-PMMA, was synthesized
by polymerization of MMA using P(Boc-Ala-HEMA)-macro-CTA following
the above-mentioned procedure.

Deprotection of Boc-Protected
Polymers
Typically, 2.0
mL of TFA was added to a solution containing 0.3 g of polymer in 1.0
mL of DCM in a 20 mL glass vial. The solution was stirred for 2 h
at room temperature, precipitated four times in hexanes from acetone
solutions, and finally dried under vacuum at 40 °C for 8 h.

Antibacterial Activity: Zone of Inhibition Method
Constituents
of Luria Bertani (LB) agar (1.0 g tryptone, 1.0 g NaCl, and 0.5 g
yeast extract in 100 mL de-ionized (DI) water) were weighed and autoclaved.
Sterile LB agar plates were prepared and 100 μL of inoculum
(either E. coli or B.
subtilis) was spread on the surface homogeneously.
The plates were allowed to dry for 10 min. UV sterile disks made of
filter paper (radius = 0.2 cm, area 0.13 cm2) were soaked
in the polymer solution prepared in sterilized distilled water and
placed on the agar plates. For each plate, three different volumes
were used for study; 50, 100, and 200 μL of each polymer solution
from an initial stock 10 mg/mL. A control plate was also prepared
without polymer. Duplicate plates were prepared for each polymer.
The agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The area of
the zone up to which the polymer prevents the bacterial growth was
measured by simple mathematical calculation. Photographs were captured
using a digital camera.

MIC was determined by an LB microdilution
technique. Here, 200 μL of E. coli culture (OD600 = 0.5) and our cationic polymer solution
from the initial 10 mg/mL stock were added to the 5 mL of LB media
and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h (overnight). A number of experimental
sets were arranged whereby the final concentrations of the polymer
solutions were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240,
280, 320, and 360 μg/mL. MIC is the lowest concentration of
antibacterial agent to prevent the appearance of visible haziness
after overnight incubation, that is, bacterial growth is resisted
completely.13 The tests were conducted
in duplicate.

Gram Staining
Gram staining was
performed with cells
collected from the zone of inhibition and from the periphery of the
plate, that is, far from the zone of inhibition, to check for the
effect of polymer on the cell morphology. Gram staining was performed
following standard published protocol41 and the slides were observed under a light microscope.

FESEM Analysis
Bacterial cells (E. coli or B. subtilis) were collected from
within the zone of inhibition and away from the zone of inhibition
from each homopolymer-treated plate and from the control plate (without
polymer). The cultures were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The
precipitates were washed with DI water two times and then with 1%
PBS (pH 7.2). 1 mL of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS was added for 0.5
μL culture in the next stage. The samples were incubated at
room temperature for 30 min and then overnight at 4 °C. The pellets
were collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS three times.
Dehydration of the samples was performed in different ethanol grades
(10, 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100% – each volume 200 μL
for 10 min). Samples were incubated in 100% ethanol for 1 h. Finally,
FESEM samples were prepared as follows: an aliquot of sample solution
was drop-casted on a cover slip, dried, and coated with gold/palladium
(20:80). Finally, images were recorded using a Carl Zeiss-Sigma instrument.

Antibacterial Activity: LB Media
Polymer antibacterial
activity was determined against E. coli cells cultured in LB. Overnight cultures were prepared and used
as the starter culture for the growth experiment. Four conical flasks
were fixed: one as blank (LB media), one as control (culture), and
two experimental set ups (culture + 200 μL of polymer). Cells
were cultured at 37 °C at 180 rpm. OD was measured using a U2900
UV-vis spectrometer at 1 h time intervals to plot the bacterial growth
curve in the presence and absence of polymer. Fractions were collected
for Gram staining and FESEM analysis.
