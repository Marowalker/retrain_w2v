All-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite
nanocrystals
(NCs) are highly attractive due to their outstanding optical and electrical
properties. However, poor stability and easy anion exchanges between
CsPbX3 nanocrystals with different halides limit their
applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). To solve the problems,
we developed an approach to in situ synthesize CsPbX3 NCs
into porous silica colloidal spheres, which can effectively prevent
anion exchange and increase photo stability. Based on our results,
we first proved that the anion exchange between CsPbX3 nanocrystals
is mainly driven by physical collision of the nanocrystals, not requiring
a bridge such as a solvent. We subsequently used an optimized ratio
of green, red, and blue SiO2/CsPbX3 composites
as solid-state luminescent materials to fabricate single-layer white
light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). No anion exchanges have been observed
in the LED fabrication and lighting process.

1 Introduction
In recent years, CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals
(NCs) have become attractive for their use in many fields such as
photovoltaic cells,1−3 photodetectors,4−8 LEDs,9−13 and lasers14−18 due to their outstanding optical and electrical properties. Particularly,
CsPbX3 NCs are suitable for application in light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) due to their wide color tunability (410–700 nm),
narrow emission line widths of 12–42 nm, high photoluminescence
quantum yields (PLQYs) of 50–90%, and short radiative lifetimes.19 Compared with traditional CdSe-based quantum
dots (QDs), the synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs can be done with
lower temperature and without extra treatment of surface shelling,
making CsPbX3 NCs promising candidates in the applications
of LEDs.

However, the anion exchange between CsPbX3 nanocrystals
(NCs) with different halides when mixed together obstructs their practical
applications in WLEDs. It is reported that CsPbBr3 and
CsPbI3 NCs can form mixed halide CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs as soon as they are dispersed together in the solvent, and this
conversion can be accomplished in 2 min.20 This quick anion exchange makes it difficult to prepare white-emission
materials just by simply mixing the CsPbX3 NCs with different
halides in one layer. Normally, green, red, and blue layers with corresponding
CsPbX3 NCs are prepared separated and then assembled on
the UV LED for emitting white light, which definitely causes more
complexities in emission layer preparation and LED assembly.21 On the other side, the mechanism study of the
anion exchange between different NCs has been rarely reported. Recently,
Alivisatos and co-workers have reported that the anion exchange between
CsPbBr3 and I– presents a surface-reaction-limited
mechanism in the nonpolar solvent.22 However,
they mainly focus on the exchange between CsPbBr3 NCs and
free I–, not the exchange directly between CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs. Whether the mechanism of these
two exchanges is consistent remains to be further confirmed. Therefore,
regardless of the application and mechanism, the study of anion exchange
between CsPbX3 NCs with different halides is urgently required.

Here, we find that the confined CsPbX3 NCs in porous
silica (SiO2/CsPbX3 composite) can efficiently
prevent anion exchange between the NCs with different halides. Considering
the structure of our as-prepared SiO2/CsPbX3 composite, the material exchange to the solution is not limited
very much because of the relatively large silica porosity, while the
direct collision between NCs is largely hindered. Therefore, we conclude
that the anion exchange between different NCs is mainly based on the
physical collision, not requiring a bridge of the solution. In a typical
synthesis of SiO2/CsPbX3 composite spheres with
good dispersion, we first prepared silica spheres by Stöber
et al.’s method,23 and then the
interior of the silica spheres was selectively etched to produce the
desired porosity with PVP as the surface-protecting agent. Instead
of mixing the pre-made CsPbX3 NCs with mesoporous silica,
we directly grew CsPbX3 NCs inside the spherical porous
silica with good dispersity in a nonpolar solvent. Due to the fact
that the anion exchange is efficiently limited by the SiO2 confinement, we can mix different ratios of green, red, and blue
SiO2/CsPbX3 composite spheres in a single layer
as solid-state luminophores for WLEDs, which showed excellent operation
stability.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
a schematic illustration of the preparation process of SiO2/CsPbBr3. Typically, the silica spheres were first coated
by PVP to prevent it from being completely dissolved by NaOH in the
subsequent etching step for strong hydrogen bonds can form between
the carbonyl groups of PVP and the hydroxyls on the silica surface.24,25 After refluxing for 3 h in an aqueous solution of PVP, silica spheres
were etched by NaOH at 30 °C. The dried porous silica spheres
were then transferred to TOP to form a good dispersion in toluene.
In this process, the TOP molecules could intensively bond with the
oxygen of the silanol groups and change the silica particle hydrophobic
characteristics to ensure that the porous silica disperses well in
the nonpolar solvent, such as toluene.26 Then, the dispersion was swiftly injected into the flask containing
the PbBr2 precursor at 150 °C to synthesize SiO2/CsPbBr3 composite spheres. The SEM image (Figure 1b) shows the spherical
morphology and narrow size distribution of the composites. The corresponding
EDX measurements carried on several different areas provided an average
of 12 atom % Si and 4 atom % Pb present in the sample, which indicated
that CsPbBr3 NCs can be loaded to the porous SiO2 spheres at a high level. Figure 1c shows the TEM image of the porous silica spheres
etched by NaOH. The low contrast and the rough surface indicate that
the spheres are porous. Figure 1d shows the HAADF-STEM image of the SiO2/CsPbBr3 composite spheres. The bright spots (marked with red circles)
demonstrate the existence of CsPbBr3 NCs in the porous
silica matrix for the contrast of the HAADF image is very sensitive
to the atomic number of materials. As shown in Figure 1e, mapping of elements including Si, O, Cs,
Pb, and Br distributed evenly against composite spheres indicates
that CsPbBr3 NCs were successfully grown into the porous
silica matrix. The EDS spectrum of a single SiO2/CsPbBr3 composite sphere displayed in Figure 1f further confirmed the composition of Si,
O, Cs, Pb, and Br. Besides, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the SiO2/CsPbBr3 composites also indicated the existence
of CsPbBr3 NCs in the porous silica spheres (Figure 1g). According to the above
measurements, we can confirm that the CsPbBr3 NCs have
been uniformly loaded to the pores of the SiO2 spheres.

The optical properties of individual SiO2/CsPbBr3 composites were investigated by microspectrum
analysis. The
SiO2/CsPbBr3 composites in the nonpolar solvent
were dispersed on the glass substrate through a spin-coating method.
An optical image (Figure 2a) shows that the SiO2/CsPbBr3 submicron
spheres can be well separated on the glass substrate. Figure 2b shows the PL microscopy image
of SiO2/CsPbBr3 spheres under a pulsed excitation
at 405 nm. As shown in Figure 2c, we measured the PL spectra of a single SiO2/CsPbBr3 composite on the substrate with a narrow green emission peak
at 515 nm and full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 20 nm, which demonstrates
that the porous silica shell does not influence the CsPbBr3 NCs crystal quality and optical properties.

field) of SiO2/CsPbBr3 composites. (b) PL microscopy
image of SiO2/CsPbBr3 composites. (c) PL spectra
of single SiO2/CsPbBr3 composite (red circle).

The ease of anion exchange reactions occurring
between green CsPbBr3 NCs and red CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs is demonstrated by
the PL spectra shown in Figure 3a. After mixing the green and red NCs together, their PL spectra
become broader and have a red and blue shift, respectively (sample
denoted as 10s and 30s). After mixing for 1 min, the green and red
PL peaks merge into a single yellow PL peak. After 2 min, the PL spectra
remain unchanged, which means anion exchange is completed. On the
other hand, the SiO2 sphere confinement successfully slows
down the anion exchange reaction between the green and red NCs. As
shown in Figure 3b,
after mixing for 30 min, no spectral shifting occurs, and the PL intensity
and spectra of the two composites are completely preserved. After
60 min, their PL spectra begin to shift. The complete mergence of
the two PL peaks requires approximately three days, which is much
longer than that without SiO2 confinement. This indicates
that the isolation of the CsPbX3 NCs by porous SiO2 spheres can efficiently prevent the anion exchange between
perovskite NCs with different halide ratios.

% mixture under UV light.

We propose two anion exchange routes between perovskite
NCs with
different halides. The first route is based on the physical collision,
and anion exchange happens quickly at the solid state during the collision
process (Figure 4a).
Because of a high collision frequency of 10 nm nanoparticles dispersed
in the solvent, together with a short diffusion path length and low
active energy of CsPbX3 NCs,20 anion exchange can easily occur by collision. The second route is
using a solvent as a bridge (Figure 4b). Typically, Br– is released from
CsPbBr3 NCs to form a balance with free Br– in the solution and then exchange with I– anions
in the CsPbI3 NCs. Considering the structure of as-synthesized
SiO2/CsPbX3 composites, the porous silica sphere
is highly permeable to the small molecules and ions, typically called
nanoreactors in the reference,27−29 having less influence in the
balance of CsPbX3 NCs and free X– in
the solution. However, direct collision of the different CsPbX3 NCs in the composite can be successfully prevented because
of the steric hindrance of the SiO2 network. According
to the significant difference of PL evolution with/without SiO2 protection, we can safely conclude that the major route of
anion exchange between CsPbX3 NCs is through direct collision,
not requiring a solvent as a bridge. As long as we prevent the direct
collisions of different NCs in the dispersion, we can efficiently
limit their ion exchanges.

Figure 4 (a) Schematic illustration of the collision
route. (b) Schematic
illustration of the solvent route using a solvent as a bridge.

The anion exchanges can result in undesirable light
mixing when
fabricating WLEDs by the direct combination of differently colored
CsPbX3 NCs in a single emissive layer. As we discussed
above, the SiO2/CsPbX3 composites are well protected
against anion exchange reactions, so they can be employed to fabricate
a single emitting layer for WLEDs. As depicted in Figure 5a, in LED packaging, an optimized
amount of green, red, and blue SiO2/CsPbX3 composites
were mixed with a transparent PMMA/toluene solution (10 wt %) and
then coated on a UV LED. The WLED is operated at a current of 20 mA
(the inset in Figure 5c). As shown in Figure 5b, the working WLED has a color coordinate of (0.33, 0.29), which
is close to that of the standard white emission (0.33, 0.33). Figure 5c shows the spectra
of the WLED at different lighting times. After the WLED has worked
8 h, there was no conspicuous change of its PL spectrum, demonstrating
great photostability. With a prolonged working time, the intensity
of the blue PL peak slightly dropped, while the green and red PL peaks
were nearly unchanged. This indicates that the blue SiO2/CsPb(Br/Cl)3 composite is a little more sensitive to
UV light than the other two. The great stability of WLEDs indicates
the promising application of SiO2/CsPbX3 composites.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we in situ
synthesized stable SiO2/CsPbX3 composites with
a narrow size distribution and good dispersion
in a nonpolar solvent. The SiO2/CsPbX3 composites
possessed a narrow emission line width and great stability. More importantly,
we found that the silica barrier can efficiently prevent anion exchange
between two perovskite NCs with different halides, and we concluded
that the major anion exchange route is based on the direct collision
between the NCs. Based on the as-synthesized composite and understanding
of the anion exchange of different NCs, a single-emission-layer WLED
has been fabricated using green, red, and blue SiO2/CsPbX3 composites as solid-state luminophores, which showed excellent
color purity and stability.

4.2 Synthesis of Silica Spheres
Silica
spheres were prepared by Stöber et al.’s method.23,30 In a typical process, 5 mL of TEOS was injected into a mixture of
100 mL of isopropanol, 20 mL of deionized water, and 5 mL of NH3·H2O under magnetic stirring at room temperature.
After reacting for 2 h, the silica spheres were collected by centrifugation
and washed with water three times and then re-dispersed in 60 mL of
deionized water.

4.3 Etching Silica Spheres
We etched
silica spheres following previously reported procedures.24 In a typical process, 6 g of PVP was added to
the abovementioned 60 mL SiO2 solution. The mixture was
heated up to 100 °C and refluxed for 3 h to load PVP. After cooling
to room temperature, 90 mL of 0.067 g mL–1 NaOH
solution was added to selectively etch silica spheres under continuous
stirring. The process was monitored by measuring transmittance of
the solution by UV–vis spectrometry. The resulting porous silica
spheres were collected by centrifugation and washed with water three
times and then dried at room temperature.

4.4 Growth of CsPbX3 within Porous
Silica Spheres
Porous silica (0.1 g) was added into 4 mL
of TOP and then stirred at 90 °C until the silica spheres were
dispersed well in the solution. A Cs-oleate solution was prepared
via a reported approach developed by Protesescu et al.19 ODE (15 mL) and 0.75 mmol of PbX2 (0.28 g of PbBr2 for green CsPbBr3 QDs, 0.24
g of PbI2 and 0.08 g of PbBr2 for red CsPb(Br0.3I0.7)3 QDs, and 0.10 g of PbCl2 and 0.14 g of PbBr2 for blue CsPb(Br0.5Cl0.5)3 QDs) were loaded into 50 mL three-neck
flasks along with 4 mL of oleylamine and 2 mL of oleic acid; then,
the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 15 min. After complete solubilization
of the PbX2 salt, 4 mL of the TOP solution of silica spheres
was added. Then, the temperature was raised to 150 °C, and the
Cs-oleate solution (2 mL of stock solution prepared as described above)
was swiftly injected, and 5 s later, the reaction mixture was cooled
down by an ice-water bath. The resulting products were collected by
centrifugation and washed with toluene three times.

4.5 Fabrication of the Single-Layer WLED
A certain amount of green, red, and blue SiO2/CsPbX3 powders were mixed in a transparent PMMA/toluene solution
(10 wt %). The obtained mixture was then coated onto a piece of quartz
glass. The glass was cured at room temperature for 30 min. Finally,
a single-layer WLED was obtained by putting the glass above a UV LED.

4.6 Characterization
The transmittance
and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were measured by the Ocean
Optics USB2000+ spectrometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements

microscope (SEM) was measured by S-3400 N II, Hitach. The photoluminescence
