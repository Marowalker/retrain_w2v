The
human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (hPDC) is a large macromolecular
machine, and its unique structural and functional properties make
it a versatile target for manipulation aiming for the design of new
types of artificial multienzyme cascades. However, model-based and
hence systematic understanding of the structure–function relationship
of this kind of complexes is yet poor. However, with new structure
data, modeling techniques, and increasing computation power available,
this shortfall is about to cease. Recently, we have built new atomistic
models of E2/E3BP, the two subunits of the massive hPDC core. Here,
we present developed coarse-grained models of the same, on the basis
of which we built and simulated the full core of hPDC, which is so
far the first simulation of the catalytic core of any member in the
branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex family. We
explored the stability of two previously proposed substitutional models
of hPDC core: 40E2+20E3BP and 48E2+12E3BP. Our molecular dynamics
simulations showed a higher stability and sphericity for the second
model. Our core’s radius of gyration was found to be in strong
agreement with previously published experimental dynamic light scattering
(DLS) data. Finally, in the direction of our experimental effort to
design active minimized complexes, we simulated C-terminal truncated
E2/E3BP cores of different lengths, which clearly showed the instability
of the core assembly and symmetry due to subunit separations. This
correlated very well with the findings of our experimental investigations
by analysis of DLS data for variable truncation lengths. The use of
polarizable water and an increased total ion concentration did not
lead to a substantially different initial stability of the truncated
mutants compared to that of standard MARTINI water; however, a different
rearrangement behavior of the fragments was observed. The obtained
structure models will serve as a basis for full complex simulations
in the future, providing the possibility for the model-assisted targeted
manipulation of such a complex enzymatic system.

==== Body
Introduction
The pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex (PDC) as a large macromolecular
machine is known to possess properties like coupled metabolic channeling
within multistep reactions, including the reactivation of diverse
co-factors. These properties along with its ability to self-assemble
with a high structural stability make this nanomachine unique. Mammalian
PDCs, for example, human PDC (hPDC), are assembled from four subunit
components: E1, pyruvate decarboxylase; E2, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase;
E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; and E3BP (binding protein).1 E2 and E3BP form the inner core of the hPDC with
a dodecahedric structural shape and in contrast to the procaryotic
PDCs that show cubic core structures formed by 20 identical building
units (E2 trimers), the hPDC core is formed by both E2s and E3BPs
with at least two distinct populations of trimeric building blocks,
as suggested recently from substitutional model, for which the stoichiometry
is not yet fully resolved.2−4

The E2/E3BP core structure
plays a key role in the PDC activity
by means of “substrate channeling”, which means it bridges
E1 and E3 via its lipoyl domains known as swinging arms by visiting
the active sites of E1, E2, and E3, respectively. In this type of
enzymatic mechanism, the reaction cascades benefit in several ways,
such as less diffusion loss, less inhibition by intermediates, protection
of intermediates, and recycling of co-factors. Overall, because of
these properties along with the ability to self-assemble and its modularity,
the E2/E3BP core and swinging arm-based channeling mechanism becomes
a high-value target for the engineering of novel multienzymatic reaction
cascades.5−7

Because of the importance of the core in this
type of enzyme complex,
this study focuses on the model-based assessment of core assembly,
structure, and dynamics to enable targeted manipulation as well as
create a foundation for the synthesis of artificial complexes in the
future.

PDC cores in general have a unique assembly. Trimeric
units can
bind noncovalently via hydrophobic interactions called anchoring effect
that occurs mutually by anchoring of a C-terminal from one monomer
to a hydrophobic pocket of the other one. In our previous work,8 we presented new models of E2 and E3BP generated
and validated at atomistic level. We explored the stability of the
subunit models and also studied the anchoring effect for their dimers.
Our results showed a strong hydrophobic interaction in the wild-type
(WT) dimers between the C-terminal of one monomer and the hydrophobic
pockets of the other one. Here, we use the previous atomistic models
as a reference for higher-scale modeling of the monomers as building
blocks of the whole core as a second step toward the design of hPDC
enzyme complex for studying its assembly, mechanism, and dynamics.

As mentioned, unlike other species, the hPDC core is formed by
both E2 and E3BP subunits. On the basis of several experimental studies,
such as analytical ultracentrifugation studies, small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) solution
structures combined with cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of
rhE2/E3BP (recombinant human E2/E3BP) assemblies, the existence of
a substitutional model was strongly supported.2−4 This model suggests
that E3BPs are distributed among E2s within the 60-meric core structure
itself. However, it is still not clear how many E3BP are located in
the core. Two specific models have been recently proposed: 40E2/20E3BP
and 48E2/12E3BP. In this article, these models are called model 1
and model 2, respectively.

The subunit composition of the hPDC
core is critical in its efficient
functioning. In other words, the numbers and positions of E3BPs among
E2s is a key on the overall core geometry that can influence its stability,
catalytic efficiency, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated
regulation.3,9 Therefore, it is very important to investigate
the structural properties of the hPDC core and the accuracy of the
proposed models. In this work, we studied these phenomena by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations at the coarse-grained (CG) level using MARTINI
force field.10 The CG modeling allows exploring
these systems on different orders of magnitude in length and time
to better understand the behavior, dynamics, and the molecular interactions
from monomeric and trimeric scales to the whole 60-meric core for
studying its overall stability.

This article is organized as
follows. The details of the force
field used at the CG level are given in the Methods section. In the Results and Discussion section,
we present and validate the CG models of E2 and E3BP subunits built
on the basis of their atomistic models. At this level, the results
for the simulation of trimeric units of hPDC are presented, and the
WT full-core models are built based on them. Finally, the effect of
the C-terminal truncation of various lengths on the core stability
is shown from our simulation results and in comparison with our previously
published experimental findings.11

Results
and Discussion
CG Modeling
New CG MARTINI models
of E2 and E3BP were
built on the basis of the previous homology models.8Figure 1 shows the atomistic model of E2 versus its CG model.

Figure 1 Atomistic model of E2
(a) vs its CG MARTINI model (b) and a bond
representation (red) of the CG model along with its elastic network
(orange) (c). The residues and bonds in the CG model (b) are colored
on the basis of Residue ID in visual molecular dynamics (VMD).

E2 and E3BP Single Monomer
After building the MARTINI
models of the E2 and E3BP monomers, to validate them and assess their
stability, we analyzed the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the
backbone (BB) beads. As shown in Figure 2, the CG model result is very well comparable
to the atomistic model results in 240 ns, and the RMSD reached a plateau
very quickly. The RMSD values calculated after 50 ns for E2 and E3BP
CG model were 0.24 ± 0.004 and 0.27 ± 0.003 nm, respectively,
which are very similar to the previous atomistic results.

Figure 2 RMSD of CG
model vs the atomistic results for E2 (a) and E3BP (b).
In case of atomistic RMSD of E3BP, along with N-terminal, α1,
which was partially unfolded and led to a higher RMSD,8 was also excluded from these calculations.

The simulations were extended to 1 μs to
confirm their stability.
The RMSD was calculated for the total and N-terminal-excluded versions,
as shown in Figure 2. The results showed good stability of both models for the N-terminal-excluded
calculation. However, in case of E2, some fluctuations from the average
value were observed after around 300 ns, and further investigation
showed that the lower flexible loop is strongly responsible for that,
as in the monomeric state, this region is quite flexible (shown from
atomistic results8).

By exclusion
of this region, the extra fluctuations were eliminated
from the RMSD, and the results showed a stable trend during the course
of the simulation. The RMSD of N-terminal- and lower-loop-excluded
versions of both proteins reached a plateau, and the values turned
out to be 0.23 ± 0.003 and 0.23 ± 0.004 nm for E2 and E3BP,
respectively.

The root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values
for the BB beads
after 50 ns and up to 240 ns were also analyzed. The results showed
a very good agreement to the atomistic ones, as shown for both models
in Figure 3. Because
of the elastic network, the CG models showed a better stability in
some regions, even better than the atomistic ones. However, for both
models, despite the elastic network, there are some regions, such
as the lower-loop areas, which are highly flexible as those in the
atomistic models. Moreover, the model effectively maintained the stability
of the active site in E2 (residues from 212 to 216). Because the N-terminal
loops were excluded from the elastic network in both models, it is
still very flexible especially in case of E3BP. These model validations
and their agreement to the atomistic results proved the reliability
of the CG models.

(a) and
E3BP (b).

Radius of Gyration
The radius of gyration (Rg) as a function
of time is presented for both
subunits in Figure 4 to compare with the atomistic results. Rg of monomers were calculated by exclusion of the flexible N-terminal.
The values turned out to be 1.78 ± 0.002 and 1.79 ± 0.003
nm for E2 and E3BP, respectively, which are very similar to the atomistic
results in 240 ns.

Figure 4 Radius of gyration of CG MARTINI models vs the atomistic
ones for
E2 (a) and E3BP (b). In all cases, the N-terminal was excluded from
the calculations.

Further screening of
the Rg values
up to 1 μs shows that within a range of several hundred nanoseconds
(in this case, ∼300 ns) there is a fluctuation or variation
cycles of the Rg values. These changes
were related to the lower loop, as shown from the RMSD and RMSF calculations.
However, by exclusion of this region from the calculations, we gained
the stable values of 1.66 ± 0.001 and 1.63 ± 0.001 for E2
and E3BP, respectively.

E2 and E3BP Dimers
As the anchoring
effect has been
identified to be a main factor in the self-assembly of the core, we
studied the C-terminal interactions in the WT E2 and E3BP dimers.
This was done as an assessment test to check whether the interactions
at the atomistic level are reproducible at the CG level. The simulation
results for WT E2 dimers showed that the initial orientation of the
monomers with respect to each other is quite stable and the C-terminal
anchoring is well maintained (Figure S1). Similar results were observed for the E3BP dimer simulation, as
shown in Figure S2.

The same simulation
setup was done for E2-t8, that is, by eliminating eight amino acids
from the C-terminals of both monomers. As seen, this truncation led
to the dimer separation. The initial orientation of the monomers was
not conserved, and they started to separate and reorient themselves
because of the absence of C-terminal anchoring effect (Figure S3). In case of the E3BP-t7 dimer system,
a separation occurred from both terminals (Figure S4).

Figure 5 shows the
average distance versus time between the two monomers for WT and the
truncated versions. Figure 5a shows the distance between the residue Glu127 located in
the upper region of the hydrophobic pocket and the C-terminal residue
Leu231 of E2-t8. The distances between the chosen residues in the
WT version were 2.08 ± 0.05 and 2.14 ± 0.07 nm, which are
in good agreement with the atomistic results, and it indicates that
our CG model is capable of reproducing the same properties and it
is quite reliable. On the other hand, in case of the E2-t8 system,
a rapid separation of monomers from one side was observed, and the
average distance reached a maximum value of 3.45 ± 0.09 nm within
only 100 ns. A similar analysis for WT E3BP and E3BP-t7 was performed
by calculating the average distance between residue Gln115 in the
hydrophobic pocket region and the C-terminal residue Leu222 of E3BP-t7.
From Figure 5b, same
as E2, in the WT system, both of the monomers are strongly bound to
both pocket sides (with average distances of 1.72 ± 0.09 and
1.77 ± 0.05 nm), which are also very similar to the atomistic
results. Upon truncations, the distances started to increase especially
from one side, and within 100 ns, it reached the maximum value of
3.05 ± 0.20 nm.

Figure 5 Average distance between Glu127 and Leu231 in E2 (a) and
Gln115
and Leu222 in E3BP (b) from both sides (1 and 2) for truncated and
WT versions.

Further, the simulations
were extended to 1 μs to check the
stability of WT dimer. For both E2 and E3BP, after 100 ns, a disorientation
of monomers was observed while the pocket anchoring was still maintained
up to 200 ns and then a separation occurred as the distance constantly
increased. From this, it may be inferred that the specific concentration
of monomers as well as their location in a 60-meric core could conserve
the original orientation without which the intermonomeric interactions
may not get stabilized by the individual dimers.

Trimer Simulation
Trimers were simulated to study the
monomeric interactions and the stability of the WT monomers in a trimeric
state. As mentioned before, the presence of E3BPs among E2s leads
to the formation of different types of trimers in their core models.
In model 1, there are 20 E3BPs, which can form only one type of trimers:
2E2/1E3BP. On the other hand, in model 2 with 12 E3BPs, two types
of trimers can be formed: 2E2/1E3BP heterotrimers and 3E2 homotrimers.
The simulations were done for the two possible types for 2 μs. Figure 6 shows the visual
presentation of the trimers. The 2E2/1E3BP trimer was built by replacing
one E2 with an E3BP. The radii of gyration for the 3E2 and 2E2/1E3BP
trimers turned out to be 2.51 ± 0.003 and 2.50 ± 0.015 nm,
respectively.

Figure 6 3E2 (a) and 2E2/BP (b) trimer presentation using quick
surf in
VMD.

Trimers were analyzed for stability
by RMSD and RMSF calculations.
The N-terminal-excluded RMSDs were plotted for individual monomers
in each trimer, as shown in Figure 7, and the average RMSDs of E2 and E3BP were calculated
as 0.19 ± 0.001 and 0.23 ± 0.008 nm, respectively. Interestingly,
these values are similar to those from monomeric simulations with
N-terminal- and lower-loop-excluded versions (Figure 2), as the lower loop in the trimer became
perfectly stabilized.

Figure 7 N-terminal-excluded RMSD of monomers for 3E2 (a) and 2E2/BP
(b)
trimers.

Figure 8 shows the
average RMSF calculated after 50 ns for E2 and E3BP in the trimeric
form and in comparison with those from monomeric systems. It can be
seen that there are several flexible regions in the interface, which
were stabilized in the trimerization process, such as the lower-loop
region and the upper β hairpin (residues 87–98). The
latter forms the upper-part region of the hydrophobic pocket. The
N-terminal is also more stable except the flexible loop, which is
now almost half its length in its free monomers. Moreover, the active-site
region (212–216), which is also located in the trimer interface,
showed a better stability (Figure 8a) because of the higher coverage from the adjacent
monomers and the interaction between the upper β hairpin with
the end part of α1. In the same way to evaluate the active-site
water accessibility, we calculated the radial distribution function
(RDF) for BBactive-site-Wbeads, that
is, the BB beads with respect to the water beads.

model vs the CG MARTINI model for E2 (a)
and E3BP (b) in monomeric and trimeric systems.

Figure 9 shows
the
RDF in both monomeric and trimeric states, that is, 3E2 trimer. The
RDF of E2 active site in the monomeric form is higher, as the active
site is exposed to more water density than in its trimeric form.

of BBactive-site-Wbeads for
E2 in monomeric and trimeric systems.

hPDC Core Simulation
WT
At this level, after an extensive
validation of
our models, we built up the full core of hPDC. We constructed the
two models suggested by the substitutional model, as the numbers of
E3BP distributed among the E2s are still not experimentally clarified.
We simulated both models (40E2/20E3BP and 48E2/12E3BP) to investigate
their structural stability and compatibility. Figure 10 depicts the two full-core models. The simulations
were performed for 6 μs to characterize their structure and
dynamics.

Figure 10 Substitutional core models of hPDC for (a, c) model 1 (40E2/20E3BP)
and (b, d) model 2 (48E2/12E3BP) and the positioning of E3BP pairs
(blue) among E2s (red). Yellow triangles show the location of different
types of trimers in each model. Depth cueing was activated in VMD
for clarity.

First, to check the
equilibration of the systems, the RMSD of the
whole WT core was calculated for the BB beads, as shown in Figure 11. It is important
to note that the RMSD values for the whole core models are significantly
greater than the RMSD value of the single monomers. This is due to
the reorientation of individual trimers with respect to each other,
which leads to a slight expansion of the core (will be seen later
in the Rg results). RMSD versus time for
model 1 reached a plateau after about 3 μs with an average value
of 1.21 ± 0.07 nm, whereas model 2 reached it within 1 μs
with an average value of 1.20 ± 0.05 nm.

Figure 11 RMSD trend vs time for
the full 60-meric core for the two substitutional
models.

The autocorrelation functions, C(t),12 of RMSD
for both the models were
calculated (Figure 12) to assess the relaxation time (τ) of the systems. As shown
in the figure, the relaxation time was evaluated by fitting of the C(t) to a single-exponential function  The relaxation
of model 1 seems to be slightly
slower compared to that of model 2; the τ values for models
1 and 2 were calculated as 1 and 0.7 μs, respectively. It seems
that a different structural arrangement of the core, that is, by increasing
the number of E3BP from 12 to 20, leads to a slower dynamics and a
longer relaxation time.

Figure 12 RMSD autocorrelation functions of models 1
and 2 and the single-exponential
fitting to them.

Further, the Rg values of WT full cores
were also calculated as shown in Figure 13. From the simulations, the Rg values of both models started to increase at the beginning
of the simulation with a slightly larger value for model 2. Both models
had close values of Rg up to about 1 μs,
but after that, the corresponding values for model 1 started to decrease
gradually but constantly from 9.65 ± 0.43 nm in 1 μs to
9.52 ± 0.003 nm within 6 μs. On the other hand, model 2
reached an average value of 9.67 ± 0.004 nm right after 1 μs
and kept the constant trend until the end of the simulation. This
value is in good agreement with the experimental value of 10.20 nm
for the same from SAXS and SANS measurements.9

Figure 13 Rg plot of full 60-meric core for both
substitutional models.

Moreover, the autocorrelation calculated for Rg led to a much lower relaxation time for model 1 than
for model 2, as shown in Figure 14. The relaxation time turned out to be 1 and 0.17 μs
for models 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 14 Autocorrelation of Rg and single-exponential
fitting to it for both of the substitutional models.

This remarkable difference in the relaxation time
of Rg might be explained by the fact that
substituting more
E2s with E3BPs in model 1 would decrease the trimer’s positioning
compatibility and thus reduce the flexibility of the whole core, which
makes the system spend much more time reaching its equilibrium state.
Previously, a mathematical study was also conducted to investigate
the core structures and their flexibility by altering the population
of E3BPs among E2s.3 They modeled the possible
E2/E3BP core arrangements by performing a systematic variation of
the E2 homotrimer and the 2E2/1E3BP heterotrimer populations. Their
investigations suggested that model 1 has low flexibility in the core
assembly, whereas model 2 can allow the maximum flexibility as well
as provide an appropriate balance for binding of E1 and E3 enzymes
on the spherical core structure of the E2/E3BP, and it has the potential
to moderate the flexibility of the E2 and E3BP lipoyl “swinging
arms” and may facilitate PDK movements around the core.3

We investigated further the structural
properties of the core models
and their stability. The structures of models 1 and 2 within 6 μs
are shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15 Structures of models 1 and 2 within 6 μs along twofold and
fivefold axes of symmetry. Backbone beads were selected for visualization.
Index coloring method was chosen for better clarity of the whole core
with no specific coloring for E2 or E3BP.

Visual inspection, however, shows that the cores do not perfectly
maintain their symmetry, especially core model 1, for which the structure
deviated from the original shape. Its size started to shrink from
0.2 μs, as it was seen from the Rg trend, and the symmetrical shape gradually changed during the simulation
time. On the other hand, model 2 showed a better stability and consistency
with only a slight deviation from the perfect shape. Therefore, to
quantify the extent of their asymmetry, we measured their asphericity
(b) by calculating the components of their Rg along X, Y, and Z axes; the average values are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Components of Rg (in nm) for the Cores
along X, Y, and Z Axes and Their Asphericity
 	Rgx	Rgy	Rgz	b	
model 1	7.7	8.0	7.7	4.71	
model 2	7.9	7.8	7.9	0.78	
The component values
show that the cores are not completely spherical
but slightly elongated. The asphericity, b, was then
calculated as  The asphericity values for
models 1 and 2
were calculated as 4.71 and 0.78, respectively. This proves a better
compatibility of positioning 12 E3BPs instead of 20 among E2s and
therefore the better flexibility of model 2 than model 1.

Partial
density profiles of each model are shown in Figure 16. From the figure, the peaks
are where the trimers are located, and the minima in the central profile
are related to those windows as shown in Figure 15. The reference profile refers to the initial
arrangement of trimers from the biological assembly. From the profiles
along X axis, models 1 and 2 do not undergo a remarkable
overall shape change. However, model 2 maintains a density profile
trend better than that of model 1, as the latter shows a reduction
of density in the peak regions (around −6 and 6 nm), which
may be due to the disorientation of the trimers from the reference
model. For both models, an expansion was also observed from the profile
edge regions (around −12 and 12 nm). Along Y axis, model 1 tends to maintain the peak regions but getting more
compact (previously shown in Figure 15). Because of an increase in the compactness of the
model, the density profile also shows an increase especially in the
window regions as the core collapses, thereby increasing the density
of these regions. This is while model 2 still expands further while
keeping the reference trend better. Along the Z direction,
model 1 shows a decrease in density in the central part of the profile
and especially in the peak side-regions (around −6 and 6 nm)
as an expansion occurs in the profile edges (around −12 and
12 nm regions). This can be due to the elongation of the core along Z axis (see Figure 15) as it gets more compact along Y axis, which
leads to a decrease in density as the trimers get further apart. A
drop of density in the peak regions can reflect the disorientation
of the trimers from the reference model. This is while model 2 shows
less expansion along Z axis. Although with this expansion
the peaks get slightly apart, the overall profile trend remains fairly
unchanged. In conclusion, model 2 shows a better consistency in this
regard.

refers to the relative position from the center.

Double-Truncated Core
To show the importance and the
effect of C-terminals on the structure maintenance of the whole cores,
we performed the same simulations with truncation of eight and seven
amino acids from E2s and E3BPs, respectively (referred to as “double-truncated”,
“dt”, or E2-t8+BP-t7). First, RMSD was analyzed, whose
value increased for both the models and reached about 2 nm for both
models, as shown in Figure 17.

Figure 17 RMSD calculated for C-terminal double-truncated core models vs
their WT.

On the other hand, Rg values calculated
for both the models decreased constantly to about 9 nm, as shown in Figure 18. This shows that
as expected the cores collapsed and therefore the Rg values decreased. The asphericity (b) was calculated for the models, and it turned out that for both
models it increased remarkably within 2 μs to 5.9 and 4.4 for
models 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 18 Rg values
calculated for the C-terminal
double-truncated core models vs their WT.

To investigate the structural properties of the double-truncated
core models, we visualized the structure of the core model 2. As shown
in Figure 19, the
core completely lost its symmetry and spherical shape. It not only
expanded and lost its original compactness but also tended to get
squeezed along Y and Z axes, which
was due to the separation of trimers, as shown in the figure. This
proves the importance of C-terminals in the maintenance of the 60-mer
structure, without which the structural geometry is lost and it leads
to the formation of apparently irregularly structured agglomerates.
However, the activity can remain intact, presumably depending on the
specific structure or type of agglomerates. Our experimental data
for the double-truncated core showed the existence of highly active
agglomerates.11 In conclusion, a highly
ordered and giant structure like the original 60-mer is not necessary
for the activity of the hPDC.

Figure 19 Structure of model 2 within 6 μs
along twofold and fivefold
axis of symmetry in comparison with the initial one at 0 μs.
At 6 μs, two different views along the twofold and fivefold
axis of symmetry are shown. Backbone beads were selected for visualization.
The black arrow shows the increase of distance and the separation
of trimers within the core. The index coloring method was chosen for
better clarity of the whole core with no specific coloring for E2
or E3BP.

The partial density profiles of
each truncated model are shown
in Figure 20. The
figure shows that, as expected, the density trends for both models
are completely lost, and both got either expanded or squeezed along
different axes. For instance, for model 2, the profile expands along X axis but shrinks along Y and Z axes, as shown in Figure 19.

6 μs.

In Silico Screening of
Single and Double-Truncated Variants
Starting from the findings
demonstrated in the previous section,
we pushed forward a complete in silico screening of different variants
and compared them with our experimental data. Specifically, it was
of interest to screen the effect of different truncation lengths on
the core stability and to investigate what length or combination of
truncations may as well lead to the core disintegration.

Full-core
simulations, based on model 2 (48E2/12E3BP) with single truncations
of E2, ranging from 1 to 8 residues (E2-t[1...8]), and E3BP, ranging
from 1 to 7 (E3BP-t[1...7]), were performed. In addition to the already
investigated double-truncation variant (E2-t8+E3BP-t7) and WT, the
systems were made up of 16 comparable simulations, all of which were
performed at least in triplicate to assess the significance of any
observed structural changes. The radius of gyration (Rg) and RMSD were computed for all the replicates as well
as their standard deviation. To analyze the results of simulation
in standard MARTINI water, a simulation time range of 2.0–2.5
μs was used. All values are depicted in Figure 21.

Figure 21 Rg (average and
standard deviation
based on triplicates) of simulated core within the simulated time
range of 2.0–2.5 μs, depending on C-terminal truncations
of either E2 or E3BP or combinations of both. Resulting populations
are grouped as follows: (I) wild-type; (II) E3BP-only truncations;
(III) E2-only truncations (short); (IV) E2-only truncations (long);
(V) double truncation (“dt”). Note that the Rg values are only expected to absolutely correlate
to the experimental data for WT. For all truncants (II–V),
they only provide a relative degree of core breakdown or instability,
as the complete disintegration or rearrangements of core (fragments)
cannot be simulated this way.

According to the effect of truncations on the core stability,
five
distinct populations have been defined: (I) wild-type; (II) with E3BP-only
truncations; (III) with short (1–3) E2-only truncations; (IV)
with longer (4–8) E2-only truncations; and (V) the double-truncated
variant. It shows that generally E3BP-only truncations (II) have no
clear effect on the core disintegration; however, the fluctuation
of the simulation increases considerably. The same holds true for
short E2 truncations (III); but, with longer E2 truncations (IV),
the size is clearly reduced (significance of all Rg values of III vs IV according to the two-sided t-test: pIV:III < 0.002).
This corresponds to the visual inspection. However, the core double
truncation (V) led to a much more efficient disintegration with pV:IV < 0.001. It can be concluded that only
long enough E2 truncations (>3–4 residues) as well as double
truncations should lead to at least partial disintegration of the
core and are by far the most efficient.

Comparison with Experimental
Data
The stability of
hPDC cores with different C-terminal truncation variants and with
or without truncation of N-terminal flexible linker arms (denoted
as catalytic domain “CD” variants) has also been investigated
in our laboratory, and the full workflow and results are published
separately.11 The hPDC wild-type and truncated
core (fragment) sizes were most reliably determined by dynamic light
scattering (DLS), yielding the distribution of hydrodynamic radii
(Rh) of particles. This typically resulted
in up to four populations depicted as (A) very large agglomerates
(Rh ≥ 30 nm); (B) single cores
of either 60-mer or a similar-sized structure (30 nm > Rh ≥ 9 nm); (C) small fragments, including
functional
subunits either as trimers or hexamers (9 nm > Rh ≥ 3 nm); and (D) smaller fragments, for example,
monomers.
The available data contain variants without flexible linker regions
(CD); for those, the expected Rh can be
estimated directly from the model data as  which holds true for globular proteins; for
elongated proteins, the factor of 0.775 increases. Hence, for the
full 60-mer, the expected Rh is . Similarly, for the catalytic subunits,
the expected radii are  for hexamers,  for trimers, and  for monomers.8 With flexible arms, the
same assessment is hardly possible for full
60-mers by adding approximate arm lengths to Rg (about 7–15 nm each side), assuming that they elongate
equally in every direction, yielding Rh,model60 ≈
21.5–31.8 nm. The measured Rh of
wild-type core lies within this range (Rh,DLSwt≡60 = 26.1 nm ± 14.7%).11 This approach
is not applicable for hexamers, trimers, monomers, or any other fragment
of the core because the average conformation of arms on these constructs
cannot be predicted; however, it is predicted that the length is shorter.

The measured Rh of the C- and N-terminal
truncated variants and their mixtures have been compared with the
simulated stability, represented by their Rg in Figure 22. As
mentioned, the calculated Rg is only a
relative measure of the core stability and should not be considered
as an absolute prediction of the resulting structure size.

Figure 22 Comparison
of simulated core stability (Rg data as
of Figure 21) with
experimentally obtained DLS data, providing Rh. (a) Comparison with experimentally available
mutants without flexible domains (CD). For these, experimental Rh is defined accurately because (almost) no
flexible regions disturb the measurement. PCC = 0.986. (b) Comparison
with mutants with flexible domains. The variable conformation of flexible
domains in these cases blurs the experimental results. The PCC decreases
to 0.857. All the experimental data from Guo et al.11 were rearranged for this comparison study.

The results show that the simulated core stability
correlates very
well (the Pearson correlation coefficient, PCC = 0.986) with the experimental
“CD” variants, that is, without large flexible domains,
and also with the other variants with reduced accuracy (PCC = 0.857).
The latter comparison shows larger deviations (e.g., E3BP-t7), which
is at least partly due to the fact that the flexible arms increase
the measured DLS radii by an ill-defined amount, whereas the DLS data
of the CD mutants are expected to be more accurate.

It is important
to note in Figure 22 that only the wild-type (top
right) and the double-truncated “dt” variant (bottom
left) showed activity. It is hypothesized that the inactivity of all
others might have been caused by the partially assembled core fragments
that cannot form functional catalytic cores, neither single trimer/hexamer
subunits nor full cores.

Polarizable Water (PW) and Ionic Strength
Because the
electrostatics are not accurate using standard MARTINI water, additional
simulations using MARTINI PW with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method
were performed. The radii of gyration for WT versions turned out to
be very similar to the previous results in standard water as 9.89
± 0.06 and 9.74 ± 0.04 nm for models 1 and 2, respectively.
The asphericity coefficients were calculated as 4.2 for model 1 and
0.65 for model 2, which are again close to those from simulations
in standard MARTINI water. The RMSD result showed that the instability
of model 1 was significantly higher than that of model 2 (RMSD1 = 1.34 ± 0.153 nm vs RMSD2 = 0.94 ±
0.025 nm, p < 0.05).

The total RMSD results
for different truncates are shown in Figure S5. Cl– ions were added to neutralize the system.
Because of the much higher computational costs, simulations were run
for only 100 ns. From the results, it was observed that the rearrangement
of the core fragments in PW is different from than in the standard
MARTINI water. In other words, the strongly disintegrating cores exhibit
an expansion (or dispersion) in PW rather than a collapse in MARTINI
water. Because of this, RMSD was chosen as the main stability criterion
instead of Rg. In line with the CG with
MARTINI water findings, significant effects on core breakdown were
also found for long E2 truncations (>4 or more) and the double-truncated
variant.

Further, the RMSD data from Figure S5 were compared with the experimental data, as shown in Figure S6. The overall stability behavior is
similar to the standard MARTINI water results (absolute PCC = 0.994
for CD variants and 0.942 for others). Because RMSD is used as a stability
criterion, the PCC becomes negative. Some minor deviations can be
identified, for example, with regard to the potential influence of
medium-sized E3BP-only truncations. Overall, the accuracy of modeling
with standard CG water for the purpose of PDC core truncation studies
seems to be sufficient while being computationally faster.

As
the effect of ionic strength is known to play a crucial role
in protein–protein interactions, we performed another set of
simulations by adding Cl– and Na+ ions
to reach an ion concentration equal to 50 mM, which is equivalent
to the upper limit from the experimental data. For these systems,
radii of gyration for the WT version were calculated as 9.86 ±
0.19 and 9.67 ± 0.01 nm, respectively, and on the basis of the Rg components, the asphericity values turned
out to be 2.4 and 1.2 for models 1 and 2, respectively. This again
confirms that model 2 with 12E3BP is more stable and flexible than
model 1 with 20 E3BPs.

The results of core stability and comparison
with experimental
data for different truncated versions of the core revealed that, overall,
the use of different ionic strengths and the long-range electrostatic
interactions (Figures S7 and S8) do not
lead to a qualitatively different core breakdown behavior in this
study. The significance of the truncation effects and correlation
to experimental data (PCC < −0.867) is slightly worse, which
is assumed to be due to the relatively short simulation times.

In summary, full-core simulations accurately allow for grouping
the modified candidates and representing the findings obtained experimentally
while providing the possibility of fine-tuned manipulations and more
flexible screening. Furthermore, the combination of different truncations
can only be reliably assessed in the fully assembled model, whereas
the monomeric interaction investigations can be incomplete or misleading,
for example, showing similar disintegration behaviors for single E3BP
and E2 truncations, which did not reflect our experimental data with
variants that had their flexible parts removed. Full-core simulations
performed with PW and long-range interactions showed similar overall
stability behaviors with respect to the length of the truncations,
but the rearrangement (reagglomeration) of the fragments after the
initial separation is strongly different from that with standard MARTINI
water. Full-core and complex simulations are therefore further developed
on all levels to guide future experimental research.

Conclusions
In this study, we utilized our recently obtained models of E2 and
E3BP subunits of hPDC core to build higher-scale models of the full
hPDC core at the CG level. This allows for exploring the dynamics
and structure on a larger size and longer time scales, which is not
possible at the atomistic level. We performed an extensive validation
of the CG model by comparing the results obtained to those from the
atomistic level as well as the available experimental data. The extension
of the simulation time and scale allowed us to study different properties
of the hPDC from monomeric to 60-meric levels. At monomeric scale,
the protein interactions and the anchoring effect were reproducible
at the CG level. Overall, both subunit models showed very good structural
stability and consistency with those from the atomistic level. Further,
the homotrimers and heterotrimers were modeled, and we built up for
the first time the full WT 60-meric core of hPDC. Two core models
(40E2/20E3BP as model 1 and 48E2/12E3BP as model 2) are suggested
from the previous experimental data, and we explored their stabilities
using different water models (standard MARTINI water (W) and PW) with
different electrostatics computation and validated the resulting core
sizes against the available experimental data, for which we found
a strong agreement especially for model 2. The measured asphericity
coefficient from the Rg components in
standard MARTINI water, PW, and PW with 50 mM ion concentration always
showed lower values for model 2. From our simulation results, it can
be concluded that model 2 has a higher stability and flexibility than
model 1.

For C-terminal truncated variants of different lengths,
full-core
simulations were performed to assess the influence on the overall
core stability. The results of Rg from
CG modeling especially for the mutants with truncated flexible domains
(absolute PCC > 0.985) showed a very good correlation with our
DLS
experimental data.

In summary, the use of PW and the increased
total ion concentration
did not lead to a substantially different initial stability of the
truncated mutants in comparison with standard MARTINI water; however,
a different rearrangement behavior of the fragments was observed.
As these simulations are computationally expensive, the single-beaded
water setups with cutoff potentials are preferably used for this truncation
study.

This work will be further continued on the assembly of
the whole
hPDC, that is, including other E1 and E3 enzymes along with their
swinging arms. This will provide the possibility to investigate the
targeted manipulation of such complex enzymatic systems and thus to
create the foundation for the synthesis of artificial complexes and
enzymatic cascades in the future.

Methods
CG Model
The CG models used for MD simulations of proteins
are based on the MARTINI force field.10,13 The model
uses a four-to-one mapping, that is, on average, it groups three to
four heavy atoms together as a single interaction center or a CG bead.
Each residue has a BB bead, and depending on the type, the side chains
can vary from zero to four beads. An elastic network was also applied
to the MARTINI model to increase the stability of the protein.14 However, in case of monomer and dimer simulations,
the N-terminal flexible loops of E2 (20 residues) and E3BP (10 residues)
were excluded from this network.

Simulation Setup
All MD simulations and analysis were
performed using GROMACS software package version 5.0.2.15,12 The visual molecular dynamics (VMD) program was used for the visualizations.16 A cutoff of 12 Å was applied for Lennard-Jones
(LJ) and Coloumbic interactions. The LJ potential was gradually shifted
to zero between 0.9 and 1.2 nm, and the Coulomb potential was gradually
shifted to zero between 0.0 and 1.2 nm. The temperature and pressure
were maintained at the reference values (for pressure, P0 = 1 bar) using v-rescale and Parrinello–Rahman
methods with the coupling time constant τT = 1.0
ps for temperature and τP = 12 ps for pressure. A
time step of 20 fs was used for the simulations. All simulations were
performed at 310 K. All of the errors on the calculated properties
have been evaluated using the block averaging method.17

E2 and E3BP Single Monomers
Single
monomers of E2 and
E3BP were simulated for their WT versions. Each monomer was positioned
at the center of a box of side ∼9 nm filled with ∼5000
MARTINI standard water beads (W). The distance from the protein to
the boundary was ∼2 nm. After 50 000 steps of energy
minimization, the system was equilibrated by performing a 2 ns long
simulation at NPT ensemble with position restraints. The MD runs were
performed under NPT conditions for 1 μs. To neutralize the systems,
one Cl– counterion was added to the E2 WT system;
however, in case of E3BP WT, the system was already neutral.

E2 and
E3BP Dimers
We set up the systems same as the
dimer simulation at the atomistic level,8 that is, the two monomers were positioned in a box while facing
each other from their C-terminals and with the same orientation in
the BST 60-mer biological assembly.18−20

Dimers of E2 and E3BP were simulated for WT and their C-terminal
truncated versions by cutting out 8 (E2-t8) and 7 (BP-t7) amino acids,
respectively. Monomers were positioned about 2 nm from each other,
which is measured as the distance between the C-terminal of one to
the hydrophobic pocket of the other. The systems were then solvated
with ∼17 000 MARTINI water in a box of ∼13 nm/side. The MD runs were performed at NPT
ensemble for 100 ns. E2 WT and truncated systems were neutralized
by adding two Cl– counterions, and in case of E3BP,
the systems were already neutral and no counterion was required.

Trimer
A single trimer was placed in a box of side
12 nm and filled with 14 000 MARTINI water. Simulation was
performed for 2 μs. For system neutralization, three and two
Cl– counterions were added to 3E2 and 2E2/E3BP systems,
respectively.

PDC Core Simulation
The full core
of hPDC was built
on the basis of the spherical shape of the biological assembly18−20 of BST 60-meric core (pdb code, 1B5S)21 as a reference model, that is, both models of 40E2/20E3PB
and 48E2/12E3PB were set up by orienting monomers in space to fill
the spherical geometry of the 60-meric core in the same way as the BST 60-mer. The cores were then positioned in a box of side
∼30 nm. Several steps of energy minimization and equilibration
were required to prepare this huge system for the main MD run. Simulations
were performed for the WT and the double-truncated version (both E2-t8
and E3BP-t7) for 6 μs in standard MARTINI water.

To further
screen the influence of variable C-terminal truncation and its length
on core stability, 15 different versions of single truncated systems,
including truncations of either E2 or E3BP and a double-truncated
version plus wild-type were prepared and simulated for at least 2.5
μs. Truncations of E2 and E3BP ranged from one to eight and
one to seven, respectively. As before, variable numbers of Cl– counterions were added depending on the net charge
of the truncated core variant. However, in the given CG presentation
with standard MARTINI water, the ions should not be taken too seriously.
Moreover, the long-range electrostatic interactions are not present,
and the first hydration shell for the small ions is considered an
implicit part of the CG ion.

Simulations with PW and the PME
summation method were performed
for 100 ns with either Cl– ions to neutralize the
system or additionally equal amounts of Cl– and
Na+ ions (740 numbers of each) to reach the right ionic
concentration of 50 mM. Each set was done in triplicate.
