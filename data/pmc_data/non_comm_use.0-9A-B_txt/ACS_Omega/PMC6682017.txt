Polymer
brushes have wide application in surface modification.
We study dense, short polymer brushes immersed in a mixing solvent
under athermal conditions using the classical density functional theory.
The brush polymer is short so that the equilibrium behavior of the
brush deviates far from the scaling laws for infinite brush chains.
The excluded volume interaction is the only interaction in the system.
We compare the excluded volume effect of solvent molecules of different
shapes. Two types of mixing solvents are considered: solvent composed
of linear oligomers and monomers, or that of spherical particles and
monomers. The effects of grafting density, solvent molecular size,
and solvent number density on the brush height, the density profiles,
the relative excess adsorption, and the brush–solvent interface
width are systematically analyzed. In the adsorption aspect, the spherical
particles have stronger ability than the linear oligomers do to penetrate
through the brush layer and gather at the substrate. In the screening
aspect, the oligomers are more capable of screening the excluded volume
interaction between the brush chains than the spherical particles.
The brush–solvent interface width decreases monotonically with
increasing oligomer length, but it has a minimum with the increasing
spherical particle size. Our research differentiates the attractive-interaction-induced
phenomenon and the volume-exclusion-induced phenomenon in dense brush
systems and exhibits the difference in the antifouling properties
of the brushes contacting solvent molecules of different shapes.

I Introduction
Polymer brushes are polymer
chains with one end covalently grafted
to a surface. The density of the grafting points is high so that the
polymer chains stretch strongly away from the grafting substrate.
Polymer brushes are central models in many important problems in polymer
science,1 such as polymeric surfactants
and structures formed by block copolymers. One of the early applications
of polymer brushes was to cover the surface of colloidal particles
to effectively avoid the flocculation of the particles and thus promote
the stability of the colloidal systems.2 Now polymer brushes have become a significant focus of polymer research
with the demand for straightforward and versatile surface modification
(adsorption, wetting, and lubrication),3 and with their use in biology-relevant applications including resistance
to nonspecific binding, cell bioadhesion, thermoresponsive surfaces,
targeted protein binding, etc.4

In
experiments, polymer brushes can be synthesized according to
two basic strategies, named as the “grafting to” and
the “grafting from” techniques.4,5 The
“grafting to” method refers to binding end-functionalized
polymer molecules to an appropriate substrate to form polymer brushes.
The “grafting from” method means preparing a surface
with immobilized initiators followed by polymerization.6−8 The latter one is more promising in the synthesis of polymer brushes
with high grafting density.4,7 With controlled grafting
density and polymerization, the physical properties of the brushes
are investigated in the experiments, including the swelling behavior,8 order–disorder transition,9 brush height,10,11 interface roughness,12 nanopatterns with selective solvents,13 etc.

The theory for polymer brushes has
been developed for more than
40 years. The first scaling description of the chain configurations
and interactions of polymer brushes was given by Alexander in 1977.14 Then, the scaling theory for the brushes was
developed. The scaling theory was based on the model that all chains
are divided into “blobs” of the size related to the
grafting site distance and the geometry of the grafting substrate.15,16 It employed the assumption that the density profile of a flat brush
is essentially uniform except for the two adjustment regions at the
end (i.e., the grafting end at the substrate and the free end near
the upper layer of the brush). However, assuming the strong-stretching
conformation and infinite chain length, Milner et al elucidated the
existence of a parabolic profile of segment density distribution.17 Moreover, mean field theory approaches,17−20 molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,21 and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations22 all
predicted that the free end segment can distribute over a wide region
in the whole brush layer rather than in a narrow upper layer. Despite
the detail difference originated from model settings, all of the theories
and simulations emphasize that the conformation of brush chains is
very different from that of the typical flexible chains immersed in
solution. With the high grafting density, the brush polymers stretch
along the normal direction to the surface due to the excluded volume
interaction.1 Therefore, the classical
density functional theory (DFT), which can employ full volume exclusion
interactions, has been widely used to study the thermal equilibrium
behaviors of the dense, short polymer brushes in the past two decades.23,24,26−29 The DFT calculations are proved
to have excellent agreement with MC and MD simulations in many systems,
including bi-sphere fluids,30 polymer melts,31 polymeric brushes,23,32−34 etc.

When polymer brushes are immersed in a
solvent, the solvent properties
have a great influence on the conformation of brush chains.3 The brushes transform from wet ones to dry ones
as the polymerization of the polymeric solvent increases. The crossover
is driven purely by entropic effects and is interpreted on the basis
of the conformation of the polymeric solvent molecules in the vicinity
of the brush.35 The effective antifouling
surface can be accomplished by a good balance between the brush chain
length and the grafting density.36 In the
constant pressure MD simulation, with the solvent–brush interaction
widely varying with temperature, the brush height changes very little
while the monomer density profiles change significantly.37 For the binary mixed brush composed of short
and long polymer chains, in addition to the grafting density and the
length difference between the chains, the solvent selectivity affects
the transition chain length to switching the component in the brush
surface outer layer.38 In diblock-copolymer
brush systems, when the solvent is poor for both components, the solvophobic
interactions drive the chains to self-assemble into micelles having
an “onionlike” structure.39

In this paper, we study the dense, short-chain brushes in
contact
with a two-component fluid composed of oligomers/monomers or spheres/monomers
under athermal conditions. We employ the classical DFT approach.31,41,42 The volume exclusion is the only
interaction in our model.

We focus on the dense, short polymer
brushes with pure volume exclusion
interaction for the reasons listed below. (1) If one’s aim
is using the minimal amount of polymer to coat the surface and accomplish
the proposed properties, such as surface antifouling and particle-suspension
stabilizing, it was suggested to use numerous short chains with a
high grafting density and a branched structure rather than few very
long, linear ones with a low grafting density.15,29 The shortest attached chain satisfying scaling behavior with a 2%
accuracy requires at least 30 bonds.40 When
the chain length is about 10 in the DFT calculations, the equilibrium
behavior of the brush deviates far from the scaling laws that are
most accurate for infinite brush chains. (2) We notice that there
are already quite a lot of DFT calculations focusing on the short-chain
brush systems with attractive interactions,24,26−28,36,38 while only a few emphasize the effect of the pure excluded volume
interaction.23 The attractive interactions
make the equilibrium behaviors much more complicated. The simpler
system without any attractive interaction can show the effect of volume
exclusion more clearly. (3) The shape of solvent molecules has a strong
impact on surface adsorption. Due to the excluded-volume-induced entropic
effect, the hard wall has the tendency to adsorb hard-sphere solvent
particles.43 However, the excess adsorption
of free linear chains at the hard surface only exists when the volume
fraction of the chains is high enough in the bulk.31 Therefore, by systematically comparing the behaviors of
the brushes immersed in oligomers and spherical particles, we can
understand the antifouling properties of the brushes to molecules
of different shapes.

II Model and Theory
The polymeric brush, composed of tangentially connected hard-sphere
chains with the first segment tethered on a flat substrate, is in
contact with binary solvent mixtures of molecules with different shapes.
The brush immersed in the solvent mixture of oligomers and monomers
is named as the brush/oligomer/monomer (BOM) system, as illustrated
in Figure 1a, and the
brush immersed in the mixture of hard spherical particles and monomers
is named as the brush/particle/monomer (BPM) system, as illustrated
in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 Schematic diagrams
of (a) the BOM system, and (b) the BPM system.
The red chains are brush polymers tethered on the gray substrate,
the blue chains represent the oligomers, the blue large spheres are
the spherical particles, and the green spheres are the monomers.

In both BOM and BPM systems, the
segment number Nb = 10 of the brush chain
is fixed in our calculation.
The diameter of the monomer σm is chosen as the unit
length σ. The segments of the brush and the free oligomers are
the same, i.e., σb = σo = σm = σ. The substrate is covered by the tethered chains
with a grafting number density ρb,0. The number densities
of the monomer, oligomer segment, and spherical particle in the fluidic
bulk are ρm,0, ρo,0, and ρp,0, respectively. We define the dimensionless volume density
of monomers, oligomers, and spheres as ρm,0σ3, ρo,0σ3, and ρp,0Vpσ3, respectively,
where No is the segment number of oligomer
and Vp = σp3/σ3 is the dimensionless
volume of spherical particles with the diameter σp.

We employ the classical DFT developed for polymeric fluids
and
brushes.27,28,31 First, we
present here the DFT for the BOM system. The Helmholtz free energy F is the function of the segment number densities ρb(Rb), ρo(Ro), and ρm(r) of the brush
chain, oligomer, and monomer, respectively. Rb ≡ (rb,1, rb,2, ..., rb,Nb) and Ro ≡ (ro,1, ro,2, ..., ro,No) represent the sets of coordinates of the brush chains
and the free oligomer chains, respectively. F is
written in the form of the sum of an ideal gas term Fid[ρb(Rb), ρo(Ro), ρm(r)] and an excess term Fex[ρb(Rb), ρo(Ro), ρm(r)]. The ideal gas
term can be expressed exactly as 1  β
= 1/kBT in which kB is the
Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.
The bonding potentials are described as 2   3  where z1 is the
perpendicular distance of the center of the tethered segment from
the substrate, δ is the Dirac-delta function, and κb and κo are the normalization constants.

The excess term of the Helmholtz free energy is attributed to the
hard-sphere repulsion and the intramolecular chain connectivity 4  The expression of hard-sphere repulsion term
is 5  where nγ(r) are the scalar and vector weighted densities which
are obtained as convolutions of the total particle density and the
corresponding weight functions.31 The expression
of chain connectivity term is 6   7  for ξα = 1 – nV2α·nV2α/(n2α)2 and ξ = 1 – nV2·nV2/n22.

The grand potential function
is related to the Helmholtz free energy
function via the Legendre transformation 8  where μα and ψα are the chemical potentials
of the α component
and the external potential exerting on the α component, respectively.
Here, ψα(Rα)
= ∑i=1Nαψα(rα,i) for polymeric components (α = b or o), where ψα(rα,i) is the external potential on individual segments.

By minimizing
the grand potential, we obtain a set of Euler–Lagrange
equations 9   10   11  The segment number density of the polymeric
molecules is the sum of the number density of the individual segments 12   13  Assuming that the density
distribution is
uniform in the x and y directions
parallel to the grafting substrate, we simplify the above equations
as 14   15   16  Among them, kb and ko are constant coefficients
for
normalization, G is the propagator function of the
free chains, and Ggi and Gfi are propagator functions for the grafting chain from the grafted
end and the free end, respectively. These propagator functions for
the grafting chain are determined from the recurrence relation 17   18   19   20  Here, θ(z) is the Heaviside
step function.

Due to the geometry difference between the oligomer
and spherical
particle, the DFT for the BPM system is slightly different from that
for the BOM system. The ideal gas term of the Helmholtz free energy
and the grand potential of BPM systems are 21   22  where ρp(r)
and μp are the number density and chemical potential
of particles, respectively. Similarly, we assume the uniformity in
the x and y directions 23  In both BOM and
BPM systems, the fundamental
interaction between the two components is the hard-sphere repulsion 24  Here, α1, α2 = b, o, p, or m. We
employ a hard-wall potential for the interaction
between the flat substrate and the components 25  Therefore, the system
has only the volume
exclusion interactions and is under athermal conditions.

For
clarity, some parameters and their value ranges in our DFT
calculation are summarized in Table 1.

III Results and Discussion
The DFT presented above is used
to calculate the thermal equilibrium
behavior of the short-chain brushes in contact with the two-component
fluid (oligomer/monomer fluid or particle/monomer fluid). The volume
exclusion interaction, which is described by the hard-sphere potential
and the hard-wall potential, is the only interaction in the system.

The self-consistent field theory (SCFT) predicted the absence of
distinct scaling regime for brush chains less than 100 monomers,35 and as indicated by MC simulations, the shortest
attached poly(ethylene oxide) chain satisfying the scaling law for
an infinite long chain with a 2% accuracy has 30 bonds.40 Moreover, it is believed that the efficient
way to stabilize the particles against flocculation with a minimal
amount of polymer is using numerous short brush chains rather than
few very long ones.15 For short chains,
the excluded volume effect is more dominant than the conformational
entropy. When the grafting density ρb,0σ2 is higher than Nb–6/5,16 which is the critical grafting density between the mushroom conformation
and the dense brush, the brush chains are stretched along the direction
perpendicular to the grafting substrate. Therefore, we fix the brush
chain length Nb = 10, and only consider
the grafting density ρb,0σ2 >
0.1.
Within our parameter space, the brush height h increases
rapidly with ρb,0. The brush segment density is assumed
to be uniform in the directions parallel to the substrate.

The
system is under the athermal conditions, where volume exclusion
is the only interaction between the components besides the bonding
potentials in eqs 2 and 3. All of the phenomena observed in this work are
attributed to the competition between the excluded-volume-induced
entropic effect and the chain conformational entropy.

The total
segment density in the solvent bulk in the BOM system
is fixed, i.e., ρ0 = ρo,0 + ρm,0 = 0.6/σ3. The packing fraction η
= πρ0σ3/6 of the fluidic bulk
is 0.314. The corresponding BPM system has the same packing fraction
in the bulk, i.e., ρ0 = ρp,0Vp + ρm,0 = 0.6/σ3.

In this paper, we focus on the effect of solvent molecular
shape
on the brush behaviors. We compare the results in the BOM and BPM
systems. We analyze the brush height h, the density
profiles, the relative excess adsorption quantities, and the width w of the brush–solvent interface by varying the grafting
density ρb,0, the bulk densities of the solvents,
and the size of the solvents. By comparing our results with previous
calculations employing attractive interactions,24,25,28 we are able to distinguish between the excluded-volume-induced
phenomenon and the attractive-interaction-induced phenomenon.

III.I Brush Height h
With high grafting
density, the brush height h is
determined by the competition between several aspects. First, the
excluded volume interaction between the tethered polymers forces the
chains to stretch perpendicularly to the substrate. Second, the conformational
entropy of the brush chain tends to restore the random walking. Third,
the solvents generate the osmotic pressure, penetrate into the brush
layer, and partially screen the excluded volume interaction between
the brush chains. Note that the height of the brush without solvent
(ρm,0 = ρo,0 = ρp,0 = 0) is always higher than that of the brush immersed in a solvent
in our model. The brush height h varies with the
grafting density ρb,0, the bulk density of the oligomers
or spherical particles (ρo,0 or ρp,0Vp), and the volume of the oligomers
or spherical particle (No and Vp), as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Brush height h as a function
of (a) the grafting
density ρb,0σ2, (b) the density
of oligomer ρo,0 or the density of spheres ρp,0Vp, and (c) the segment number
of free oligomers No or the relative volume
of sphere Vp.

The grafting density ρb,0 is one of the
most significant
parameters to the brush behavior. For the dense brushes, the distance
between the neighboring grafting sites on the substrate is less than
the radius of gyration of a single tethered chain. The chains stretch
perpendicularly to the substrate due to the contacting (exclusive)
interaction between each other. The higher ρb,0 causes
stronger stretching. Consequently, the brush height h increases monotonically with ρb,0, as shown in Figure 2a.

With fixed
ρb,0 and No in BOM systems, h decreases with increasing ρo,0, indicating
less stretching of the brush chains with the
higher oligomer density, as shown in Figure 2b. This is ascribed to the screening effect
of the mobile oligomers.16 The mobile chains
screen out the interactions between the grafted chains and consequently
decrease the brush thickness. The screening effect is stronger with
higher ρo,0. However, h in the BPM
systems exhibit a more complicated behavior with ρp,0Vp. With different particle bulk densities, h can be either increasing or decreasing monotonically with
increasing ρp,0Vp, as
shown in Figure 2b.

With moderate grafting density (ρb,0σ2 = 0.1), h in the BOM system decreases smoothly
with increasing No, and approaches the
limit value, as shown in Figure 2c. Although the free oligomers are too short for the
brush system to enter the scaling region,40 this phenomenon agrees with the equilibrium brush behavior predicted
by de Gennes that h decreases with increasing No in the mobile-chain-dominated fluid.16 However, the scaling law No–a for infinite
long-chain brushes is not valid in our model, because the tethered
chain length is too short to produce the accurate scaling law.40 In the BOM system with ρb,0σ2 = 0.4, h is stable when No varies, as shown in Figure 2c.

In the BPM systems, as shown in Figure 2c, h increases with Vp in general, except
when Vp < 5 and ρb,0 is low. Apparently, h in the BPM system also approaches
a limit value before Vp reaches the critical
size for the phase separation
between the hard-sphere particles and hard-sphere monomers.44

In conclusion, the brush height h in both BOM
and BPM systems is sensitive to the grafting density ρb,0. Increasing ρb,0σ2 from 0.1 to
0.4 causes the increase of h for approximately 50%.
The solvent component density in bulk (ρo,0 and ρp,0Vp) and the solvent volume (No and Vp) only influence h in a range less than 20% within our parameter space. The
brush in the BPM system is always higher than that in the corresponding
BOM system with No = Vp, ρo,0 = ρp,0Vp, and the same ρb,0. The difference
between the h values in the corresponding BOM and
BPM systems remains approximately constant with increasing ρb,0, as shown in Figure 2a. However, the dependence of h on the solvent
component density and the solvent volume is different in the BOM and
BPM systems. To understand the phenomenon, we will discuss the segment
density distribution of all components in the following part.

III.II Density Profiles
We assume the
uniform density distribution in x and y directions parallel to the grafting substrate. Thus, only the density
profiles in the z-direction normal to the flat substrate
are analyzed. We differentiate three layers in the brush region according
to the density profiles and the solvent adsorption modes.3 (1) The substrate layer, where the initial segments
of the brush stretch strongly. The diffusion of the solvent molecules
through the brush to stay in this layer is named primary adsorption.
(2) The inner layer, where the brush segment density ρb(z) oscillates around a density plateau. The adsorption
of solvent particles in the inner layer is named ternary adsorption.
(3) The outer layer, where ρb(z)
decreases and approaches zero. The outer layer is the brush–solvent
interface. The solvent adsorption at the brush–solvent interface
is named secondary adsorption.

The density profiles with various
grafting densities ρb,0 are plotted in Figure 3. The increasing ρb,0 causes the lift of the brush density plateau and the increase
of the number of density peaks in the inner layer. Correspondingly,
less solvents penetrate into the brush layer with higher ρb,0 in both BOM and BPM systems.

Figure 3 Density profiles along
the z-direction in (a)
the BOM systems and (b) the BPM systems with various grafting densities
ρb,0. Parameters are No = Vp = 5 and ρo,0 =
ρp,0Vp = 0.4/σ3.

Due to the excluded-volume-induced
entropic effect, the excess
adsorption on the wall is positive in the system of hard-sphere fluid
contacting with a hard wall.43 Similar
excess adsorption was also found in polymer melt contacting with a
hard wall when the packing fraction of the polymer in bulk is higher
than 0.3.31 The brush creates a barrier
to prevent the oligomers and spherical particles from the substrate.
As shown in Figure 3, when ρb,0σ2 = 0.1 and 0.2, both
the oligomers and spherical particles overcome the barrier and form
the primary adsorption layer on the substrate. In particular, with
ρb,0σ2 = 0.1, the peak of spherical
particle density distribution ρp(z) on z = σp/2 is even higher than
the spherical particle density in the bulk, ρp,0.
Therefore, the moderate grafting density ρb,0σ2 = 0.1 is insufficient to protect the substrate from contacting
with the oligomers and spherical particles.

When ρb,0σ2 = 0.4, as shown in Figure 3, all of the oligomers
and spherical particles are squeezed out of the substrate layer and
the inner layer of the brush, and only the small solvent can stay
in the substrate layer.

The density profiles with fixed ρb,0, No, and various ρo,0 in the
BOM system are shown in Figure 4a. With the high grafting density ρb,0σ2 = 0.4, increasing ρo,0 hardly influences
the brush segment density distribution ρb(z). In the substrate layer, ρb(z) for z < 1 decreases slightly with
increasing ρo,0. In the outer layer, ρb(z) for z > 4 lifts a
little
in the smaller z region and decreases slightly in
the larger z region. This indicates the sharpening
of the brush–solvent interface with increasing ρo,0. In the inner layer, ρb(z) for 1 < z < 4 hardly changes with ρo,0 under the high grafting density conditions.

Figure 4 Density profiles (a)
of the BOM systems with various ρo,0 and (b) of the
BPM systems with various ρp,0. Parameters are No = Vp = 10 and
ρb,0σ2 =
0.4.

The brush segment density ρb(z) responds more strongly to the solvent
bulk density in the BPM system
than in the BOM system, as shown in Figure 4b. With increasing ρp,0,
ρb(z) decreases obviously in the
substrate layer and the inner layer, while the frontier of the brush
moves to larger z. Interestingly, although the brush
chain stretches more strongly in the BPM system than in the corresponding
BOM system, less monomers are found in the substrate layer and inner
layer. We attribute the conformational change of the brush chains
in response to ρp,0 to the variety of osmotic pressure
instead of the swelling effect of the monomer. When σp > σm and the total volume fraction of the solvent
is fixed, the increasing of ρp,0 results in the decrease
of the total molecular number in the solvent. The osmotic pressure
exerted on the brush, which screens the excluded volume interaction
between the brush chains, is reduced correspondingly. Consequently,
the brush chain stretches more strongly with larger ρp,0. Note that, in Figure 4b, the curves of ρp(z) and ρm(z) show the peaks of secondary adsorption
in the outer layer of the brush when ρp,0 is high
enough.

The segment density ρb(z) of
a very dense brush with ρb,0σ2 =
0.4 is also hardly influenced by the dimensionless solvent molecular
volume No and Vp, as shown in Figure 5. Comparing the BOM and BPM systems, we find that ρb(z) responds to Vp a
bit more strongly than to No. As shown
in Figure 2c, h in the BPM system has a visible increase with Vp when ρb,0σ2 = 0.4, while h in the BOM system stays nearly constant
with varying No.

Figure 5 Density profiles (a)
of the BOM systems with various No and
(b) of the BPM systems with various Vp. Parameters are ρo,0σ3 = ρp,0Vpσ3 = 0.4
and ρb,0σ2 = 0.4.

With the high grafting density ρb,0σ2 = 0.4, the behaviors of the density distributions
of the
solvents are different in the BOM and BPM systems, as shown in Figure 5. When No = Vp = 2, both the oligomers
and the spherical particles penetrate into the brush. The primary
adsorption peak of the spherical particles is much higher than that
of the oligomers. When the molecular size is larger than five, both
the oligomers and the spherical particles are squeezed out of the
brush. The secondary adsorption peak of spherical particle emerges
with large Vp. The behavior of the BPM
system agrees with the results of DFT calculation on the brush immersed
in the binary mixture of hard spheres by Borówko et al.23 They concluded that the big molecules were adsorbed
in the outer layer of the brush, whereas the small ones penetrated
through the polymer films and gathered at the hard surface.

However, in the BOM system, the secondary adsorption peak of oligomers
is not observed within our parameter space in this work. When No is large, we only find a weak adsorption peak
of monomers in the outer layer of the brush at z ≈
7σ. Although the brush chains are very short in our model, we
still find a crossover from wet brushes (where the oligomers penetrate
the brush) to dry ones (where the oligomers are squeezed out) as the
oligomer length increases. This phenomenon was also observed in SCFT
calculations,35 and was interpreted as
a pure entropic effect of the conformation of the polymeric solvent
molecules in the vicinity of the brush. In the SCFT calculation, it
was observed that only the monomeric solvent would substantially penetrate
the brush and that the effect of the polymeric solvent is to compress
the brush by osmotic and conformational entropic pressure.

We
also present the density profiles with varying No and Vp when the grafting
density ρb,0 is relatively low, as shown in Figure 6. With ρb,0σ2 = 0.1 and the solvent volume No or Vp increasing,
the decreasing density profiles of the oligomers and the spherical
particles show the ordinary phenomenon that it is harder for the large
molecules to penetrate into the brush than the small ones. As shown
in Figure 6a, the brush
becomes dense in the substrate layer and the inner layer when No increases in the BOM systems. Consequently,
the brush height h decreases monotonically with No, as shown in Figure 2c. However, as shown in Figure 6b, the increase of Vp only strongly influences the brush segment
density in the substrate layer in the BPM systems. In the inner layer
and the outer layer, ρb(z) responds
weakly to the change of Vp.

Figure 6 Density profiles
(a) of the BOM systems with various No and (b) of the BPM systems with various Vp. Parameters are ρo,0σ3 = ρp,0Vpσ3 = 0.4
and ρb,0σ2 = 0.1.

In conclusion, the brush segment density ρb(z) is very sensitive to the grafting density
ρb,0. When ρb,0 is moderate, the
brush responds
to the change of the solvent environment obviously. However, when
ρb,0 is very high, the brush chains hardly respond
to the solvent variation. The secondary adsorption of the spherical
particles is observed with a large solvent size and high ρp,0Vp, while the secondary adsorption
of the oligomers never appears in our calculation.

III.III Relative Excess Adsorption
By
calculating the relative excess adsorption quantities Aoe and Ape (defined in eq 28),
we compare the oligomer’s and the spherical particle’s
ability to penetrate through the brush barrier. The adsorption of
the solvent in the brush depends strongly on the size, shape, and
bulk density of the solvent molecule. In the case of the dense brush
with pure steric interaction, the brush chains occupy the space near
the substrate and generate a barrier to prevent the solvents from
the substrate. Therefore, the excess adsorption isotherms for the
solvents are negative in our model. However, the relative excess adsorption
quantity of the monomer Ame is positive, because the monomer is
smaller than the other solvents. Without attractive interactions,
the smaller molecules can penetrate through the brush more easily
than the larger ones. Moreover, we have Aoe = −Ame in the BOM systems, and Ape = −Ame in the BPM systems.
A large absolute value of Aoe and Ape indicates a strong barrier for
the oligomers and spherical particles to diffuse to the substrate.
Note that the barrier is originated from the pure excluded volume
effect and the entropic effect. The relative excess quantities varying
with the system parameters are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Relative excess adsorption amount Ake as a function
of (a) the grafting density ρb,0, (b) the bulk density
of oligomers ρo,0 or the bulk density of spherical
particle ρp,0Vp, and
(c) the segment number of the oligomers No or the relative volume of the spheres Vp. The solid lines represent the data of the BOM systems, and the
open circles represent the data of the BPM systems.

Increasing the grafting density ρb,0 means the
increasing amount of obstacles near the substrate and the less free
space for solvents to fill in. As shown in Figure 7a, both Aoe and Ape decrease rapidly
with increasing ρb,0. We find that Aoe and Ape in the corresponding BOM and BPM systems nearly overlap each other
when the oligomers and the spherical particles are small or dilute.
However, when the oligomers and spherical particles are large and
dominant in the solvent, Ape is obviously lower than Aoe. This indicates
a larger barrier to the spherical particles than that to the corresponding
oligomers with the same volume.

With ρo,0 =
0 (or ρp,0 = 0) and
ρo,0 = 0.6 (or ρp,0 = 0.6), Aoe and Ape vanish, because the fluidic bulk is one-component. As shown
in Figure 7b, Ao,0 and Ap,0 are
concave curves with ρo,0 and ρp,0, respectively. In both BOM and BPM systems, the minimum of the concave
curve decreases and shifts to higher ρo,0 or ρp,0Vp when the grafting density
ρb,0 increases or the molecular volume No,0 or Vp,0 increases.

The relative excess adsorption quantities decrease monotonically
with No or Vp with fixed ρb,0, ρo,0, and ρp,0, as shown in Figure 7c. With low ρo,0 or ρp,0, Aoe in the BOM system approximately equals Ape in the corresponding
BPM system. Both of Aoe and Ape approach their limit values with
the increase of their molecular volumes. However, when the oligomers
or the spherical particles dominate the fluid bulk, Ape decreases
with increasing Vp much faster than Aoe does with increasing No. Therefore,
we conclude that the brush excludes the spherical particles much more
strongly than the oligomers when No and Vp are large. When the brush is dense, the oligomers
can squeeze into the brush layer and change their conformation to
adapt to the crowded environment. However, the brush chains have to
adapt the spherical shape when a spherical particle is buried in the
brush. The larger spherical particle causes the greater loss of the
brush chain conformational entropy. Therefore, the dense brush provides
a much stronger barrier to the large spherical particle than to the
oligomer with the same volume.

Comparing our results with the
DFT calculation of the brush systems
with attractive interactions,24,25,28 we find two main differences listed below.

First, the azeotropic
point never appears in our calculation. The
azeotropic point is defined as the zero value of the relative excess
adsorption quantity with none of the two solvent components vanishing.
Increasing the density of one solvent component (correspondingly decreasing
the density of the other one) to make the relative excess adsorption
quantity passing the adsorption azeotropic point indicates the reverse
of the preference of the brush. In the BPM system with attractive
interactions,24 the adsorption azeotropy
was frequently observed. However, it never appears in our calculation
with pure hard-wall and hard-sphere interactions. Moreover, the azeotropic
point also emerges in the BOM system with the Lennard-Jones potential,25,28 when the attractive interaction between the brush and the oligomers
is sufficient and No is larger than a
critical value. Therefore, we conclude that only the BOM and BPM systems
with attractive interactions can exhibit the adsorption azeotropic
point, where the enthalpy competes with the entropic effects originated
in volume exclusion.

Second, the relative excess adsorption
quantity decreases monotonically
with increasing oligomer’s length in our calculation, while
it can either increase or decrease with the oligomer’s length
in the BOM system with the Lennard-Jones potential.28 According to Figure 12 in Borówko et al’s
work,28 when the attractive interaction
between the brush and the oligomers is stronger than that between
the brush and the monomers, the behavior of the relative excess adsorption
in response to the increasing oligomer length is different on two
sides of the critical oligomer segment density. In our model, lacking
attractive interactions, the behavior of the relative excess adsorption
quantity is much simpler. The longer oligomers are always more strongly
excluded by the dense brushes than the shorter ones.

III.IV Width of the Brush–Solvent Interface
As predicted
by previous theories and simulations on polymeric
brushes,16,21,33 the brush
with high grafting density has a fluidic inner layer with approximately
constant density and an outer layer between the brush and solvents
with decreasing brush segment density. We analyze the width of the
outer layer, i.e., the width of the brush–solvent interface,
in the BOM and BPM systems.

As shown in Figures 3–6, the number
density of the brush segments ρb(z) oscillates strongly. The volume fraction of the brush segments
ϕb(z) is much smoother than ρb(z). In the following part, we only focus
on the brushes with ρb,0σ2 = 0.4,
and analyze the interface width w by fitting ϕb(z) with the function ϕb = B/2[1 – tanh(2/w(z – C))], as shown in Figure 8. Here, B is
the constant volume fraction in the inner layer of the brush, and C is the center of the interface region. The brush height h with ρb,0σ2 = 0.4 varies
between 6σ and 7σ. The width of the interface analyzed
in our short polymer brush systems always occupies more than 30% of
the brush layer.

Figure 8 Volume fraction of the brush segments, ϕb(z), in a BOM system. The red line is the fitting
line of
the data from z = 1 to z = 10.

In the BOM systems, the width w of the brush–solvent
interface decreases with increasing No and approaches the convergent value, as shown in Figure 9a. The convergent value decreases
with increasing ρo,0. Although w varies with ρo,0 and No, the fitting parameters B and C hardly change. The volume fraction plateau value is 0.36 < B < 0.38, and the center position of the interface area
is 5.75 < C < 5.95. We interpret the behavior
of w in the BOM system in the same way as de Gennes
did.16 The mobile chains screen out the
interaction between the grafted chains when ϕo,0 dominates
ϕ in the bulk, and the brush chains are ideal when the brush
contacts with the melt of polymer with No much greater than Nb. This screening
effect strengthens with increasing No and
ρo,0.

Figure 9 Width w of the brush–solvent interface
with ρb,0σ2 = 0.4 in (a) the BOM
systems and (b) the BPM systems. The dashed line is the interface
width of the brush contacting the one-component fluid with ρm,0σ3 = 0.6.

The width of the brush–solvent interface w in the BPM systems is shown in Figure 9b. w is nonmonotonic with
the molecular volume Vp in the BPM systems.
With ρb,0σ2 = 0.4 and fixed ρp,0, w decreases with Vp until it reaches its minimum at Vp ≈ 5, and then increases with Vp to approach a convergent value related to ρp,0.
We relate this phenomenon with the density profiles in Figure 5b and interpret as follows.
On one hand, the spherical particles distributing in the outer layer
of the brush expands the brush–solvent interface. With increasing Vp, the ability of the spherical particles to
penetrate into the brush weakens, and the ability to expand the interface
weakens accordingly. On the other hand, increasing Vp causes the decrease of the osmotic pressure exerted
on the brush, because the total molecular number in the bulk decreases
with increasing Vp. The brush chain stretches
more strongly with lower osmotic pressure. Therefore, w increases with decreasing osmotic pressure in the large Vp limit. The competition between these two aspects
causes w to decrease with small Vp and increase to approach a convergent value with large Vp. In Figure 9b, the minimum of w is at Vp ≈ 5, which occurs in correspondence
with the molecular volume with which the primary adsorption fades.
Note that B and C change more strongly
in the BPM systems. For example, with ρp,0Vpσ3 = 0.5 and ρb,0σ2 = 0.4 in Figure 9b, B decreases from 0.36 to 0.33 and C increases from 5.98 to 6.53, when Vp increases from 2 to 20.

IV Conclusions
We have studied the equilibrium behaviors of the short polymer
brushes immersed in a two-component solvent under athermal conditions,
via using the classical DFT. The brush chains are very short so that
the equilibrium behavior of the brush deviates far from the scaling
laws that are most accurate for infinite brush chains. The interaction
in our model is pure volume exclusion. We employ the hard-sphere interactions
between different components and the hard-wall interactions between
the substrate and the components. We focus on the brush height h, the density profiles, the relative excess adsorption
quantities, and the width w of the brush–solvent
interface. We compare the results in the BOM and BPM systems to reveal
the different volume exclusion effects of the linear oligomers and
the spherical particles to the brushes.

In both BOM and BPM
systems, the brush height h increases strongly with
the grafting density ρb,0. The oligomers have a stronger
ability to screen the excluded volume
interaction between the brush chains. Therefore, the brush height h in the BOM system is always lower than that in the corresponding
BPM system with the same solvent molecule volume and density (Vp = No and ρp,0Vp = ρo,0).
In the BOM system, h decreases monotonically with
the oligomer density ρo,0 in the bulk. However, h can either increase or decrease with increasing ρp,0, depending on the volume of the spherical particles in
the BPM system.

The spherical particles exhibit stronger primary
adsorption on
the substrate than the oligomers. The secondary adsorption in the
outer layer of the brush is observed in the BPM systems when Vp is large enough. However, the secondary adsorption
of the oligomers is not observed in the BOM systems with the parameter
space employed in this paper.

The negative value of the relative
excess adsorption quantities, Aoe and Ape, indicates that
both the oligomers and spherical particles
are more excluded by the brush than the monomers. When the molecular
volume is large, Aoe in the BOM systems is obviously higher than Ape in the corresponding BPM systems.

With very high grafting
density of the brush (ρb,0σ2 = 0.4),
the brush–solvent interfacial
width w decreases with oligomer length No monotonically in the BOM systems, while it has a minimum
with increasing Vp in the BPM systems.

We would like to emphasize that the equilibrium behavior in our
model is determined by the competition between the excluded volume
interaction, the translational entropy, and the conformational entropy.
Our simple model helps to reveal the pure volume exclusion effects,
therefore the phenomena strongly depending on the attractive interactions,
such as the azeotropic points and the alternative adsorption behavior
with various molecular size, do not exist in our model.
