Milk
polar lipid interfacial behavior continues to be analyzed
using Langmuir trough experiments, but the reported Langmuir trough
subphases commonly used are not fully representative of milk. A method
to transform liquids of biological origin, such as milk, into appropriate
Langmuir trough subphases does not currently exist, which hinders
the applicability of Langmuir trough experiments to nature. Here,
a procedure to manufacture milk-derived Langmuir trough subphases
with insignificant amounts of surfactants from bovine milk is presented.
Ultrafiltration is used to remove the bulk of protein surfactants
from milk followed by the creation of solvent-induced emulsions that
remove trace proteins and lipids from collected skim milk permeates.
Change in surface tension upon compression of resulting washed permeates
from the surfactant removal process was ≤0.1 mN/m, terming
the permeates non-surface-active (NSA). NSA permeates (72.4 ±
0.2 mN/m) had a surface tension similar to that of ultrapure water
(72.6 ± 0.1 mN/m), but their pH, conductivity, percent total
solids, Brix percentage, alkalinity, and hardness were not the same,
with NSA permeates being more compositionally similar to skim milk
than water. The lift-off points of milk ganglioside GM3 monolayer
surface pressure–area isotherms spread on NSA permeates and
ultrapure water subphases were significantly different when compared
for the same sample, indicating that surface tension measurements
obtained on ultrapure water are not the same as with NSA milk permeate.
Overall, surfactants were removed from bovine milk without the addition
of exogenous compounds, allowing for the production of a NSA solution
derived from milk that can be used in the Langmuir trough experiment
to more realistically resemble the natural environment of milk polar
lipids. The procedure described here was able to produce NSA solutions
for other dairy beverages aside from milk, indicating that it can
be applicable to other biological fluids.

==== Body
Introduction
Milk polar lipids mainly
reside in the milk fat globule membrane
(MFGM).1,2 Because of the extensive variety of lipid
species found in the MFGM, analyzing the interfacial behavior of milk
polar lipids found in milk directly has remained a challenge. In the
past decade, the interfacial behavior of MFGM polar lipids has been
studied in model systems using Langmuir troughs.3−6 Milk innately contains both protein
and lipid molecules that behave as surfactants at the air–water
interface, and these molecules can interfere with the collection of
accurate data during Langmuir trough experiments, making pure milk
an unsuitable subphase for Langmuir trough experiments.

Reported
Langmuir trough experiments on milk polar lipids over
the past decade have used subphases that are not fully representative
of milk. Subphases that have been used in milk polar lipid Langmuir
trough experiments are ultrapure water, 1,4-piperazinediethane sulfonic
acid (PIPES) buffer solutions that may include 50 mM NaCl and 2–5
mM CaCl2, and a saline citrate–phosphate buffer
solution with 0.16 M NaCl.4,5,7,8 Ultrapure water (18.0 MΩ·cm,
pH = ∼5.7 when exposed to air) can be readily obtained from
a water ultrapurification system, but it is not representative of
milk because it is more acidic than milk and lacks many of the ions
present in milk.9 PIPES buffer solutions
can have a pH (6.7) and ionic strength similar to that of milk, but
they lack the presence of lactose, magnesium, potassium, phosphate,
and citrate found in milk.6,8,10 Furthermore, the NaCl concentration of 50 mM used in PIPES buffer
solutions is above the average concentration of sodium and chloride
in both bovine and human milk.10 Saline
citrate–phosphate buffer solutions with 150 mM NaCl can have
their pH adjusted so that it is comparable to that of milk, but these
buffers still lack many of the ions found in milk.7,11

There is currently no reported systematic method of removing surfactants
from biological liquids so that they can be used as Langmuir trough
subphases. Use of biologically relevant subphases in Langmuir trough
experiments is known to affect the results obtained.12 In this work, a procedure to produce virtually surfactant-free
solutions from milk is presented as a method to feasibly manufacture
realistic subphases from milk for Langmuir trough experiments. A method
describing the transformation of milk into a suitable Langmuir trough
subphase is not only necessary for improving the accuracy of Langmuir
trough experiments on MFGM lipids but it can also become an important
methodology for producing protein-free solutions from milk that can
be used to selectively study milk proteins. Formation of suitable
subphases from liquids of biological origin will not only improve
experiments performed directly on Langmuir troughs, but it can also
improve the relevancy of techniques employing a Langmuir trough, such
as the creation of Langmuir–Blodgett films.13

It was hypothesized that appropriate subphases could
be produced
from milk without significantly changing the milk’s composition
of nonsurfactant molecules because lipids and proteins can be removed
from solutions without the addition of foreign substances. The majority
of milk lipids can be removed by passing the milk through a cream
separator, and this process is ideal because it is mechanical. Removal
of proteins from milk, on the other hand, has traditionally been performed
through acid-induced precipitation which can change the concentration
of ions in the milk or even contaminate the milk with exogenous chemical
species. The procedure described here has two major steps: ultrafiltration
to remove most of the proteins in skim milk and then washing of the
collected permeate with hexane and chloroform to remove residual polypeptides.

Lift-off point analysis of milk ganglioside GM3 surface pressure–area
isotherms measured on either washed milk permeate or ultrapure water
subphases is presented as an example of the differences that can be
observed in milk polar lipid Langmuir trough experiments when a more
realistic subphase is used. The objective of this work was to show
that there are measurable differences in the results obtained in milk
polar lipid Langmuir trough experiments depending on the subphase
selected, and not to describe the behavior of specific milk polar
lipids. Efficient removal of surfactants from three dairy ingredient-containing
beverages aside from skim milk was also achieved, indicating that
the procedure described here can transform non-milk dairy liquids,
as well as potentially other biological liquids, into suitable Langmuir
trough subphases.

Results and Discussion
Compositional Parameters
of Bovine Skim Milk and Associated
Permeates
No significant difference in pH or electrical conductivity
was observed between bovine skim milk and its crude permeate (CP)
collected from ultrafiltration (Table 1). This was expected because the 10 kDa molecular weight
cutoff membrane used for ultrafiltration would allow ions to pass
through the membrane. A significant increase in pH was observed in
the solvent-washed permeate compared to the pure skim milk used to
produce the permeate, but this was probably a result of a slight dilution
of the permeate during the solvent washing steps. Nevertheless, both
the crude and solvent-washed permeates had pH values in the pH range
commonly accepted for bovine milk (6.6–6.8).21 The electrical conductivity of a solution is related to
the ion concentration of the solution. The electrical conductivity
of degassed ultrapure water is 1.9 ± 0.1 μS/cm, while the
electrical conductivity of bovine milk is reported to be 4.0–5.5
μS/cm.22−24 Electrical conductivity values of analyzed bovine
skim milk and associated permeates were within reported literature
values.

a Differing letters indicate significant
differences within a parameter (α = 0.05).

Crude skim milk permeates obtained
during ultrafiltration had a
significantly lower percentage of total solids and Brix percentage
compared to the skim milks used to produce them (Table 1). This was expected because
of the removal of proteins during ultrafiltration. No significant
difference in the percentage of total solids nor Brix percentage between
the crude and solvent washed permeates was detected. The insignificant
decrease in percent total solids between solvent-washed permeate and
CP was due to the removal of trace proteins and lipids adsorbed to
the permeate–solvent interface of emulsions separated from
the permeate during the solvent washing steps.25 The main solute in solvent-washed permeate is expected
to be lactose, which is supported by the fact that the percentage
of lactose in milk is between 3.6 and 5.5% and both the percent total
solids and Brix percentage lie within this range.21 Ultrafiltration through a 10 kDa membrane should not significantly
impact a solution’s concentration of lactose.26

The alkalinity and hardness of bovine skim milk and
associated
permeates were detected to be over 300 ppm, while both the alkalinity
and hardness of ultrapure water were found to be 0 ppm. High alkalinity
is indicative of high buffering capacity, while a high hardness value
is indicative of a high concentration of divalent ions.27,28 Given that the alkalinity and hardness values of the skim milk permeates
did not decrease to zero indicates that they are not the same as ultrapure
water, and that ions and small buffering molecules were able to pass
through the ultrafiltration membrane. For all parameters tested, the
compositional parameters measured for solvent-washed milk permeate
were comparable to those of bovine skim milk. It is evident that the
solvent-washed milk permeate is not pure water. A more thorough analysis
on the concentration of mineral ions, such as calcium, of crude bovine
skim milk permeate obtained using an ultrafiltration scheme similar
to the one described here has been described before.26

The composition of milk serum can be modeled by simulated
milk
ultrafiltrate (SMUF), which is predominantly a saturated calcium phosphate
solution meant to resemble the calcium concentration in milk for the
study of milk proteins.29 While SMUF created
from high purity ingredients would theoretically be surfactant-free,
it lacks nonprotein nitrogenous compounds present in milk, which have
been detected in milk ultrafiltrate by those trying to improve the
original SMUF formula.26,30 Because SMUF lacks some chemical
species found in milk ultrafiltrate, the solvent-washed skim milk
permeate described here would be a more realistic solution of milk
serum. For example, monoethanolamide, which has been detected in milk
ultrafiltrate, is known to reside at the air–water interface,
potentially influencing measured results obtained from Langmuir trough
experiments.31 SMUF does not contain monoethanolamide.
Furthermore, SMUF as originally described by Jenness and Koops is
unstable, and would need to be prepared by current methods described
by Dumpler and collaborators to ensure stability.29,30,32

Surface Activity of Dairy Liquids and Associated
Permeates
A surface-active solution is defined here as a
solution whose surface
tension decreases upon compression. The surface tension of a liquid
will only decrease upon compression if surfactants are present at
its surface. Bovine skim milk is a surface-active solution given its
high protein content (Figure 1). Upon compression, adsorbed proteins at the air–aqueous
interface can lower the surface tension more than in the uncompressed
surface, causing a measurable difference in surface tension.

Permeate from skim milk was also surface-active (Figure 1). This was expected as trace
proteins and peptides in the CP could act as surfactants. The change
in surface tension upon compression was of higher magnitude for crude
skim milk permeates than for pure skim milk probably due to a greater
presence of protein at the air–water interface. That being
said, surface activity measurements are only used here to determine
whether surfactants are present at the air–aqueous interface.
Solutions whose surfaces have a decrease in surface tension upon compression
without the addition of an external surfactant can be deduced to have
endogenous surfactants, but whether the solution has low or high concentration
of surfactants is not relevant when the goal is to have no surfactants.
Ultrafiltration through a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane
alone was not enough for removing all surfactants from skim milk.
A previous study that ultrafiltered bovine skim milk through a 10
kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane found that acidification was
necessary to remove proteins in the collected permeate.26

Solvent-washed skim milk permeates had
a surface activity ≤
0.1 mN/m, terming them non-surface-active (NSA) (Figure 1). The NSA nature of solvent-washed
milk permeates allows them to be suitable Langmuir trough subphases.
Ultrafiltration of milk through a membrane with a lower molecular
weight cutoff than 10 kDa might remove more protein, but the resulting
permeate might still need to be solvent washed to remove trace amphipathic
peptides. It was hypothesized that surfactants can be removed from
milk without the need to add substances to the milk. The procedure
described here supports this hypothesis as surfactants were unable
to be detected after their removal by ultrafiltration and solvent-induced
emulsification, both processes that do not acidify nor purposely add
compounds to the milk.

To show that the procedure described
here is not only applicable
to skim milk, NSA permeates from three other dairy-based beverages
were produced. The pure and CPs of all three non-milk beverages were
surface-active (Figure 1). While MFGM-enriched infant formula (MIF) and milk protein-based
meal replacement beverage (MMR) contained protein, cream containing
beverage (CIB) had a surface-active CP even though it was not labeled
with a significant protein or fat content (Table 2), indicating that trace lipids and proteins
can play a role in a solution’s surface activity. All resulting
solvent-washed permeates from all three non-milk beverages had a surface
activity ≤ 0.3 mN/m, essentially terming them NSA. The process
described here can produce NSA permeates from multiple dairy liquids,
not just milk. With the lack of a method in the literature to transform
biological fluids into suitable Langmuir trough subphases, the method
described here could be used for that purpose.

Surface Tension of Dairy Liquids and Associated
Permeates
To compliment surface activity measurements, surface
tension measurements
were made to observe the relative decrease in surfactants in permeates
as surfactants were removed through ultrafiltration and solvent washing
of the permeates. The more surfactants a solution has, the lower its
surface tension will be compared to its pure solvent. Water is the
solvent of milk, so the surface tensions of milk permeates were compared
to the surface tension of ultrapure water. Bovine skim milk had a
significantly lower surface tension (42.9 ± 0.7 mN/m) than ultrapure
water (72.6 ± 0.1 mN/m) given its high protein content (Figure 2). After ultrafiltration,
crude bovine skim milk permeate had a higher surface tension (53 ±
2 mN/m) than pure bovine skim milk because of the removal protein
surfactants (Figure 2). NSA skim milk permeate (72.4 ± 0.2 mN/m) had a surface tension
similar to ultrapure water.

Figure 1 Surface activity over time graphs for bovine
skim milk, a dairy
CIB, a MIF, and a MMR along with their associated permeates. Measurements
were started after the surface was fully compressed and the surface
was allowed to equilibrate for 1 min. Mean and standard deviation
values are given for bovine skim milk and associated permeates, while
proof-of-concept measurements are only presented once for non-milk
beverages. For all graphs, values of liquids without modification
are plotted with squares, values for the CP of the liquids are plotted
as circles, and values for solvent washed permeates (NSAP) are plotted
as triangles. For skim milk NSAP, all plotted points had a y-axis standard deviation ≤ 0.06 mN/m.

While NSA milk permeate and ultrapure water have similar
surface
tensions, they are not the same substance. NSA permeate was shown
to contain solutes which ultrapure water does not have.26 The similarity in surface tensions could be
based on the opposing effects the ions and acids in NSA milk permeate
would have on surface tension.33 Lactose
is not expected to significantly influence surface tension measurements.34

The solvent of all three non-milk beverages
was also water (Table S1). All three non-milk
beverages had surface
tensions below that of ultrapure water (Figure 2). All CPs collected from the beverages had
higher surface tensions than the starting beverages, as seen for skim
milk (Figure 2). Solvent
washing the CPs caused their surface tension to be comparable to that
of ultrapure water (Figure 2). The results found for milk and non-milk beverages followed
a similar pattern, indicating that the surfactant removal process
described here is not only applicable to milk. NSA permeates of all
dairy liquids had a similar surface tension to that of ultrapure water,
indicating that NSA permeate produced as described here can replace
ultrapure water as a subphase in the production of surface pressure–area
isotherms.

Milk Ganglioside GM3 Surface Pressure–Area
Isotherms
Controlling for the sample analyzed, the lift-off
points of milk
GM3 surface pressure–area isotherms measured on NSA skim milk
permeate subphases were significantly higher than those measured on
ultrapure water subphases (Figure 3). This exemplifies how the selection of a biological
subphase can influence the data collected during a Langmuir trough
experiment. GM3 monolayers at the air–water interface have
been shown to expand under the presence of polystyrene-bound lactose
in the subphase.35 Given that lactose is
expected to be the major solute present in NSA skim milk permeate,
the expansion of the lift-off point observed for the milk GM3 surface
pressure–area isotherms obtained on a NSA skim milk subphase
compared to ultrapure water might be because of the interaction of
the GM3 molecules with lactose. The interaction between the headgroup
of GM3 molecules and lactose might be mediated by calcium ions, but
this has not been confirmed for pure GM3 monolayers, such as the ones
studied here.36 The presence of ions in
Langmuir trough subphases have been reported to influence the interfacial
behavior of polar lipids that can be found in milk.37,38

Figure 2 Surface
tension over time graphs for bovine skim milk, a dairy
CIB, a MIF, and a MMR along with their associated permeates. Mean
and standard deviation values are given for bovine skim milk and associated
permeate samples, while proof-of-concept measurements are only presented
once for non-milk beverages. For all graphs, values for pure liquids
are plotted as squares, values for CPs are plotted as circles, and
values for NSA permeates are plotted as triangles. For skim milk NSAP,
all plotted points had a y-axis standard deviation
≤ 0.3 mN/m. The surface tension of all NSA permeates was comparable
to that of ultrapure water, hence the overlap in the plotted points.

Milk GM3 was analyzed for its reproducible results
for the ranges
analyzed (see rational in Experimental Section), and only the lift-off point was analyzed as it could be feasibly
obtained without having to speculate about possible lipid oxidation
of the spread GM3 monolayers. Furthermore, reproducibility of milk
GM3 surface pressure–area isotherms at high surface pressures
was unobtainable for the conditions analyzed, making it unfeasible
to provide a definitive, complete surface pressure–area isotherm
for milk GM3. NSA milk permeate is more reminiscent of milk, making
the data collected on NSA milk permeate more applicable to milk than
the data collected on ultrapure water. It should be noted that the
GM3 samples used were composed from multiple chemical species, creating
vast variability between the samples analyzed.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Bovine skim milk, a dairy CIB, a MIF, and
a MMR were all purchased locally from a major supermarket. Table 2 reports the fat,
cholesterol, and protein content of all four dairy liquids analyzed
(see Table S1 for ingredient information).
Skim milk instead of whole milk was used because it is commercially
available and has most lipids already removed. MIF was prepared following
manufacturer directions using ultrapure water with a resistivity of
18.2 MΩ·cm and a pH of 5.7. Ultrapure water was obtained
from a Thermo Scientific Barnstead Smart2Pure ultrapure water purification
system (50129870) equipped with an ultrafiltration module (50133981).
HPLC grade chloroform and hexane and ACS grade acetone were purchased
from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Particle size −100
activated carbon was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
CEM fiberglass 10 × 10 cm sample pads were purchased from CEM
Corporation (Matthews, NC). HPLC grade methanol was purchased from
EDM Millipore Corporation (Billerica, MA). USP Spec grade ethanol
was purchased from Decon Labs Inc (King of Prussia, PA).

Bovine
milk ganglioside GM3 (>99%) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids
(Alabaster, AL), and stored without further purification at −20
°C. GM3 is an anionic ganglioside that is present in whole bovine
milk at a concentration of 0.15 ppm (Figure 4).14 The ceramide
backbone of bovine milk ganglioside GM3 is mainly composed of long-chain
(C22:0, C23:0, C24:0) fatty acids.15

point.

acid is variable.

Ultrafiltration
Bovine skim milk and dairy beverages
were ultrafiltered through a 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off 0.57
m2 Biomax membrane (P3B010A05) encased in a stainless steel
Pellicon 3 cassette ultrafiltration module (MilliporeSigma, USA) by
recirculating mode. Sample was fed into the module by an easy-load
MasterFlex pump (Millipore, USA) at a flow rate of 3.0 ± 0.5
L/min in accordance with recommended feed flow rate parameters for
the membrane used.16 Feed inlet pressure
(186 ± 6 kPa) and temperature (22 ± 2 °C) for all materials
was kept constant throughout filtration, except for MMR, in which
the feed inlet pressure was maintained at 207 ± 7 kPa to obtain
the desired feed flow rate. All samples were concentrated by a volumetric
factor of 2. Permeate was collected and stored at 4 °C until
further use. Permeate collected at this stage was termed crude as
it had no further purification.

Solvent Removal of Permeate
Proteins
HPLC grade hexane
was added to collected permeate (1:10 v/v). The permeate–hexane
mixture was stirred using a Teflon-coated stir-bar revolving at 600
rpm for at least 10 min. The mixture was separated in a separatory
funnel after the mixture was left to equilibrate for 2 min. The washed
permeate (lower phase) was collected, while the permeate-in-hexane
emulsion (upper phase) was discarded. To remove particles that can
contaminate the Langmuir trough, a similar process as was performed
with hexane was performed using chloroform. HPLC grade chloroform
was added to the washed permeate (1:10 v/v) and the mixture was stirred
at 600 rpm for at least 10 min. After allowing the permeate–chloroform
mixture to equilibrate for 2 min in a separatory funnel, the permeate-in-chloroform
emulsion (lower phase) was discarded and the washed permeate (upper
phase) was decanted into clean glass bottles.

Twice washed permeates
were vacuum filtered through a 1 mm layer of activated carbon that
rested on top of a fiberglass sample pad cut to fit inside a porcelain
Büchner funnel. Filtered Permeates were washed sequentially
twice more with HPLC grade hexane as was done before. Permeate collected
after the fourth solvent wash was again filtered through a 1 mm activated
carbon layer supported by a fiberglass sample pad inside a Büchner
funnel to remove trace peptides still left in the permeate. After
the second round of carbon filtration, permeates were stored at 4
°C until further use. The permeates were not treated further
after this point.

Analysis of Bovine Skim Milk and Associated
Permeates
An Expert Pro-ISM pH probe (30014096, Mettler Toledo)
was used to
measure the pH. Conductivity (mS/cm) was measured using an H1763100
digital conductivity electrode (Hanna Instruments). Percent total
solids (w/w) was measured using a Smart 6 microwave and infrared moisture
analyzer (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC). Brix percentage was measured
using a digital pocket refractometer (PAL-α model, ATAGO, Japan)
tared using ultrapure water. Alkalinity and hardness were measured
(ppm) simultaneously, colorimetrically, and semiquantitatively using
EasyStrips (Tetra Holding Inc, Blacksburg, VA). All tests were performed
in triplicate, and were used as they are feasible to check the integrity
of a solution right before it is used as a subphase. Only the composition
of bovine skim milk and associated permeates was analyzed.

Surface
Activity Measurements
Surface activity was
measured on a Teflon-coated KSV NIMA Langmuir trough (Biolin Scientific,
Finland) with a working area of 26 700 mm2. The
Langmuir trough was housed in a homemade plexiglass box covered during
the recording of any measurement. For each experiment, the trough
was rinsed five times with ultrapure water after being cleaned with
acetone and ethanol. After being warmed to room temperature (21 °C),
∼350 mL of a dairy liquid or permeate was added to the trough,
and 2 ethanol-cleaned Delrin barriers were placed on the surface to
establish the working area. A 39.24 mm wide Wilhelmy platinum plate
was flamed and placed on a Wilhelmy balance so that a third of the
plate from the bottom was submerged in the subphase. The balance was
allowed to equilibrate for 2 min, after which, the surface tension
measured by the Wilhelmy plate balance was tared. The barriers of
the trough were compressed so that the working area decreased by 74.1%
to the minimum working area the barriers could be compressed to without
touching the Wilhelmy plate. The barriers were compressed to the maximum
distance allowed, so that all surfactants at the surface could be
accounted for. The surface was allowed to equilibrate for 1 min after
compression, and then surface activity was recorded for 10 min. All
measurements were taken at 21 ± 1 °C and at a relative humidity
of 55 ± 6%. For bovine skim milk and associated permeates, measurements
were performed in triplicate. Only one representative measurement
for non-milk beverages and associated permeates is shown as these
measurements were only used to show proof-of-concept.

Surface Tension
Measurements
Inside a plexiglass box,
∼50 mL of dairy liquid or permeate was added to a clean glass
dish on a height-adjustable stage placed below a Wilhelmy plate balance.
A 39.24 mm wide platinum plate was flamed and then placed on the Wilhelmy
plate balance without touching the dish or its contents. The stage
was slowly raised so that the liquid on the dish covered half of the
Wilhelmy plate, and then lowered, so that the Wilhelmy plate was close
to the surface of the liquid on the dish, but without touching it.
After 2 min of letting the plate stabilize, the mass of the plate
was tared. Very slowly, the stage was raised until the plate made
first contact with the surface of the liquid on the dish. A cover
was placed on the plexiglass box, and the entire system was left to
equilibrate for 3 min. The surface tension was measured for 40 min
as this is around the maximum amount of time that a Langmuir trough
experiment analyzing unsaturated lipids can be performed for before
the unsaturated lipids undergo significant oxidation.17,18 All surface tension measurements were performed at 21 ± 1 °C
and a relative humidity of 51 ± 7%. For bovine skim milk and
associated permeates, measurements were performed in triplicate. As
for surface activity measurements, only one representative measurement
for non-milk beverages and associated permeates is shown as these
measurements were only used to show proof-of-concept.

Milk Ganglioside
GM3 Monolayer Surface Pressure–Area
Isotherms
Milk ganglioside GM3 samples were warmed up to
room temperature (21 °C) for 1 h while sealed in nitrogen gas.
Afterward, each GM3 sample, as received, was dissolved in a chloroform–methanol
(2:1 v/v) mixture to reach a final GM3 concentration of 1.4 mM. The
average molar mass (1268.653 g/mol) stated for each GM3 sample was
used in calculating the final concentration of each solution. For
each experiment, ∼350 mL of desired subphase, either ultrapure
water or NSA bovine skim milk permeate, was added to a clean Teflon-coated
KSV NIMA Langmuir Trough with a working area of 26 700 mm2. The Langmuir trough was housed in a homemade plexiglass
box, which was covered during the recording of every measurement.
Two Delrin barriers were placed on the surface of the subphase to
form the working area. A 39.24 mm wide platinum plate was flamed and
then placed on a Wilhelmy plate balance so that a third of the plate
from the bottom was submerged in the subphase. The barriers were compressed
to decrease the working area by 74.1% to make sure that the change
in surface tension due to compression was ≤0.2 mN/m, indicating
a clean subphase. The surface pressure of NSA skim milk permeate remained
as ≤0.2 mN/m when the working area was compressed to its maximum
point and then fully decompressed, making NSA skim milk permeate an
ideal subphase for Langmuir trough experiments.

Using a gas-tight
syringe and with the barriers fully expanded, 24 μL of prepared
GM3 solution was spread dropwise on the working area. A light-blocking
curtain was placed on top of the plexiglass box to block the spread
GM3 monolayer from direct light. The solvent used to spread the GM3
monolayer was allowed to evaporate for 10 min. Afterward, the barriers
on trough were compressed at a rate of 5 mm/min/barrier until a surface
pressure of 2 mN/m was reached. Surface pressure–area isotherms
were recorded to a target surface pressure of 2 mN/m as this was enough
to determine an extrapolated lift-off point of each isotherm. The
lift-off point of each isotherm was calculated by extrapolating the
mean isotherm data at the surface pressure points recorded at 0.5,
1.0, and 1.5 to 0 mN/m using OriginPro 2018 (OriginLab Corporation).
Using extrapolation to determine the lift-off point of an isotherm
does not necessary allow for the calculation of the empirical lift-off
point, but using extrapolation has the advantage of being systematic,
so that multiple isotherms can be compared in the same manner, and
for the lift-off point calculated to not be heavily influenced by
noise because Wilhelmy plate balance measurements have an error of
at least 0.1 mN/m.19 All isotherm data
were collected at 21 ± 1 °C and a relative humidity of 55
± 4%. Individual samples were measured at least once in each
subphase, producing at least three isotherms for each subphase from
three different samples.

Milk GM3 was analyzed as it was found
to have reproduceable surface
pressure–area isotherm results for the surface pressure range
analyzed for each individual sample tested. GM3 isotherms on an ultrapure
water subphase for each individual sample had measured surface pressure
and mean molecular area standard deviations of ±0.5 mN/m and
±1 Å2, respectively, which were similar to measured
standard deviations of single lipid species isotherms.20 Surface pressure–area isotherms on an
ultrapure water subphase were attempted for other milk polar lipids
extracted from milk aside from GM3, but the variability of obtained
results for individual samples of those lipids was too high to consider
the results reproduceable (data not shown). The variability in the
results obtained was due to the heterogeneity of lipid species within
the samples as the samples were extracted from milk and composed of
multiple lipid species.

Statistics
All statistics were computed
on OriginPro
2018. Permeate composition measurements were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA tests followed by Tukey post-hoc tests. Milk ganglioside GM3
monolayer lift-off point measurements were compared between subphases
by a paired sample t-test. α was set at 0.05
for all statistical tests.

Conclusions
Ultrafiltration
and solvent-induced emulsions can be used to turn
milk into an appropriate Langmuir trough subphase. NSA milk permeates
can be used to more accurately resemble the environment milk polar
lipids are exposed to in nature during Langmuir trough experiments.
This is important in increasing the relevancy of these experiments
to the behavior of MFGM lipids in milk and validating previous studies
performed with simple subphases such as ultrapure water. Surfactants
were removed from milk without the addition of foreign substances,
supporting the hypothesis that surfactants in dairy liquids can be
removed without having to add exogenous compounds that could change
the composition of the liquids. Milk was not the only dairy liquid
that could be transformed into a NSA solution, indicating that the
procedure for producing Langmuir subphases described here could be
applied to other biological fluids. Transformation of liquids of biological
or natural origin into ideal Langmuir trough subphases is necessary
for advancing the relevancy of techniques that employ a Langmuir trough
to natural systems, such as foods.
