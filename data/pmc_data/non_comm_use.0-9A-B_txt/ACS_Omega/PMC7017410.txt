A class of aryne precursors, that
is, 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates, has been developed
through well-established synthetic routes, which allow the formation
of arynes under relatively mild conditions. All the aryne precursors
were obtained from phenols and 4-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride, an
inexpensive and easy-to-handle reagent with relatively low toxicity,
and subjected to nucleophilic addition reactions, providing addition
products in yields of 24 to 92%, and to cycloaddition reactions, affording
cycloadducts in yields up to 80%. This work provides interesting insights
into the mechanisms of aryne generation. In addition, 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate was successfully employed in the total synthesis
of (±)-aporphine.

Introduction
Arynes have been widely
employed in preparative organic chemistry, including total syntheses
of bioactive natural products1 and preparations
of functional materials.2 Accordingly,
there are several methods for the formation of benzyne and its derivatives
described in the literature.3 Despite the
relevance of these methods in the current context of benzyne chemistry,
2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl trifluoromethanesulfonates have emerged as
useful reagents for the formation of arynes through a fluoride-induced
reaction under mild conditions.4,5 Moreover, some silylaryl
triflates are commercially available, and others containing electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing groups can be synthesized through well-established
routes.4,6

There are advantages to the application
of 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates in organic synthesis; however,
trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is used in their synthetic routes.4,6 Although trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is a commonly used reagent,
its use should be discouraged since it is a relatively toxic, expensive,
corrosive, and volatile liquid.4,6 From a review of the
literature on benzyne chemistry, we found other silylated aryne precursors
that were prepared without the use of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride:
(a) phenyl(silylaryl)iodonium triflates (2),7 (b) silylaryl imidazolylsulfonates (3),8 (c) silylaryl nonafluorobutanesulfonates
(4),9 (d) silylaryl sulfofluoridates
(5),10 and (e) silylaryl halides
(6)11 (Scheme 1). Phenyl(silylaryl)iodonium triflates (2) are well-known compounds that have been used as efficient
aryne precursors over the last few decades. The iodonium salts 2 have iodobenzene as the leaving group, but their synthesis
involves trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.7 Even though silylaryl imidazolylsulfonates (3) can
be considered an attractive alternative for the generation of arynes,
they are obtained from 1,1′-sulfonyldiimidazole,8 which is more expensive than trifluoromethanesulfonic
anhydride. Silylaryl nonafluorobutanesulfonates (4) are
rather interesting because they generate arynes through a domino process
from 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl trimethylsilylethers9b and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenols;9d however, they employ nonafluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride, a reagent
with disadvantages comparable to those of triflic anhydride. In addition,
silylaryl sulfofluoridates (5) can generate arynes without
the use of cesium fluoride, but they required the use of sulfuryl
fluoride,10 which is a neurotoxic gas.
The use of silylaryl halides (6) is convenient for the
generation of arynes because they can be prepared in one step from
commercially available starting materials. However, since these compounds
employ aryl bromides as the starting materials and TMPLi as the strong
non-nucleophilic base,11 their preparation
requires rigorous control to prevent the formation of arynes (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Previously Reported
Alternatives to Silylaryl Triflates and the Novel Benzyne Precursor
Introduced by This Work
In the search for a substitute for triflic anhydride, we found
studies using benzenesulfonates as leaving groups.12,13 Cunico and Dexheimer explored 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate
in the benzyne generation, but they were unsuccessful (the desired
products were obtained in very low yields).12 Knochel and co-workers reported the formation of (hetero)arynes
using halo(hetero)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates. Although this approach
employed (hetero)aryne precursors obtained from 4-chlorobenzenesulfonyl
chloride, which can be considered an inexpensive and easy-to-handle
reagent with relatively low toxicity, somewhat strong and nucleophilic
bases were required to promote the halo-magnesium exchange reaction
followed by the elimination of 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate to afford
substituted (hetero)arynes.13 Motivated
by previous studies, we selected, synthesized, and evaluated silylphenyl
benzenesulfonates and silylphenyl sulfamate, which have considerable
potential for the generation of benzyne and its derivatives via fluoride-induced
reactions under mild conditions, aiming to obtain a novel class of
aryne precursors that employs an inexpensive and easy-to-handle reagent
with relatively low toxicity as a substitute for trifluoromethanesulfonic
anhydride, with applications in several transformations and in the
total syntheses of natural products.

Results and Discussion
Initially, we synthesized 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl benzenesulfonates 7a and 10, starting with the iodination reaction
of phenol (8a), which produced 2-iodophenol (9a) in 40% yield.14 Then, we performed a
sequence of reactions in the same flask, which required only one purification
by column chromatography, with the protection of 2-iodophenol (9a) by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS),6,15 followed
by a retro-Brook rearrangement6,15 and workup with the
appropriate sulfonyl chloride to afford 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl benzenesulfonates 7a and 10 in yields of 81 and 75%, respectively
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of 2-(Trimethylsilyl)phenyl Benzenesulfonates 7a and 10 and 2-(Trimethylsilyl)phenyl Sulfamate (12)
We prepared 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
dimethylsulfamate (12), inspired by one efficient aryne
precursor reported by Daugulis and Mesgar.11 Thus, we carried out the protection of 2-iodophenol (9a) with HMDS,6,15 followed by an iodine-lithium
exchange reaction6,15 and workup with water, leading
to 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenol (11) in 80% yield. Then,
compound 11 was subjected to reaction with sodium hydride,
affording a phenolate ion, which was allowed to react with sulfamoyl
chloride16 to provide 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
dimethylsulfamate (12) in 87% yield (Scheme 2).

To evaluate the efficiency
of 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates (7) as aryne precursors, we selected as a model reaction the nucleophilic
addition of phenol (8a) to 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7a), aiming to obtain diphenyl ether (13a) in a reasonable yield (Table 1).

a Reaction conditions:
Phenol (8a) (0.25 mmol), benzyne precursor (7a, 10, and 12) (0.375 mmol), F– source, additive(s), and solvent (4 mL) were maintained under stirring
at the temperature and time indicated.

b The starting material 7a was partially recovered.

c The formation of compound 14 was observed by GC/MS analysis.

d The formation of compound 15 was observed
by GC/MS analysis.

e The formation
of compound 16 was observed by GC/MS analysis.

f The formation of compound 17 was observed by GC/MS analysis.

We allowed phenol (8a) to react with
1.5 equiv of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a) employing 3 equiv of cesium fluoride (CsF) in acetonitrile
(MeCN) at room temperature and at 50 °C for 24 h, and we did
not obtain diphenyl ether (13a) (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). However, when the same
reaction was carried out at 80 °C, compound 13a was
isolated in 24% yield (entry 3). Note that, as shown in entry 3, compound 14 was obtained as the major product according to GC/MS analysis.
We therefore assumed that the reaction to generate benzyne (1) proceeded through a polar mechanism after compound 14 was presumably formed via a carbanion 7a′, which abstracted a relatively acidic hydrogen from the reaction
medium (Scheme 3).
Nevertheless, we could not rule out the formation of compound 14 through a substitution reaction between phenol (8a) and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a). When Larock and Liu treated phenol (8a) with 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
triflate in the presence of CsF to produce diphenyl ether (13a) in 92% yield, they did not report the formation of phenyl triflate,17 indicating that 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates
possibly generate arynes through a concerted mechanism. In addition,
Lan and co-workers published a detailed theoretical work suggesting
that the generation of benzyne (1) by the reaction between
2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate and CsF may proceed through a concerted
transition state.18 Thus, in the current
work, we considered how the mechanism of benzyne formation can be
influenced by the leaving group present in the benzyne precursor.

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanisms for the Benzyne Generation Using Compound 7a
In an attempt to prevent the
formation of compound 14, we performed a reaction with
phenol (8a) and 1.5 equiv of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a) in the presence of 3 equiv
of CsF using 1 equiv of cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) in MeCN at 80 °C for 24 h, which produced diphenyl ether (13a) in 32% yield (entry 4). When 2 equiv of Cs2CO3 was used, compound 13a was obtained in
a similar yield of 30% (entry 5).To avoid a possible attack of carbanion 7a′ on the relatively acidic hydrogen of acetonitrile
(pKa = 31.3 in DMSO),19 we carried out the reaction between phenol (8a) and 1.5 equiv of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7a) with 3 equiv of CsF and 1 equiv of Cs2CO3 using benzonitrile (PhCN) as the solvent, and diphenyl
ether (13a) was obtained in less than 5% yield (entry
6). As shown in entry 6, the starting material 7a was
not completely consumed. Therefore, we decided to repeat the reaction,
adding 1 equiv of 18-crown-6 ether,9d which
resulted in the complete consumption of starting material 7a, and diphenyl ether (13a) was isolated in 48% yield
(entry 7). When the same transformation was performed at 100 °C,
compound 13a was obtained in 29% yield (entry 8). Diphenyl
ether (13a) was not produced when TBAF20 (entry 9) and potassium fluoride (KF)21 (entry 10) were employed as the sources of fluoride ions,
and the starting material 7a was partially recovered
in both experiments (Table 1).

Expecting to generate benzyne (1) through
a concerted mechanism to prevent the formation of compound 14, we changed the leaving group present in 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a) to 2,4,5-trichlorobenzenesulfonate,
a weaker base (and presumably, a better leaving group) than 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7a″) (Scheme 3). Thus, we performed several experiments using 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (10) as a benzyne precursor.
Nevertheless, the product of interest 13a was obtained
in yields of ≤14% (Table S1 in the
Supporting Information). The low yields obtained for compound 13a can be partially explained by formation of considerable
amounts of compounds 15 and 16. Compound 16 was presumably obtained through an aromatic nucleophilic
substitution (SNAr) reaction involving an addition–elimination
mechanism between phenol (8a) and compound 15 (Table 1, entry 11).

Still attempting to generate benzyne (1) through a
concerted mechanism, we changed the leaving group present in the benzyne
precursor 10 to dimethylsulfamate (Scheme 2). In addition, the use of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
dimethylsulfamate (12) in the nucleophilic addition reaction
would prevent the formation of the undesired product 16 (Table 1, entry 11).
Accordingly, we carried out various experiments using 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
dimethylsulfamate (12) as the benzyne precursor. However,
the product of interest 13a was isolated in yields of
≤12% (Table S1 in the Supporting
Information). The low yields obtained for compound 13a can be partially explained by formation of substantial amounts of
compound 17 (entry 12).

Before the reaction scope
was studied, silylaryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates 7b and 7c were obtained by a sequence of reactions in the same flask,
which required only one purification by column chromatography from
iodinated phenols 9b and 9c, and silylaryl
benzenesulfonates 7d and 7e were prepared
through the production of disilylated intermediates 18a and 18b, as shown in Scheme 4.1g,6,15

Scheme 4 Preparation of 2-(Trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-Chlorobenzenesulfonates 7b–7e
Employing the optimized conditions for the preparation of diphenyl
ether (13a) (Table 1, entry 7), we examined the scope of nucleophilic addition
reactions using various nucleophiles 8, 20a, 21, 22, and 23 and 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonates (7) (Table 2).

mmol), and 18-crown-6 ether (0.25 mmol) in PhCN (4 mL) were maintained
under stirring at 80 °C for 24 h.

b Isolated yield.

c 10 mmol scale.

The reactions
using 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a) and phenols substituted with electron-withdrawing groups led to
the formation of nucleophilic addition products 13b and 13c in yields of 51 and 70%, respectively. However, when phenols
substituted with electron-donating groups were employed, diphenyl
ethers 13d and 13e were achieved in 24 and
30% yields, respectively. In the reactions to obtain compounds 13b, 13d, and 13e, undesired 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates
(19) were generated, presumably by the substitution reaction
between the phenols 8 and silylphenyl benzenesulfonate 7a, according to GC/MS analyses. The low yields for O-arylation products 13d and 13e can be partially explained by the formation of 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates 19b and 19c in considerable amounts. To provide
quantitative information concerning the formation of 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates
(19), compound 19c was isolated in 35% yield
(Scheme 5). Note that,
for the reactions involving the preparation of compounds 13a–13e, we observed the formation of compound 14 by GC/MS analyses (Table 2).

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation of 4-Chlorobenzenesulfonates 19a–19c
In the sequence, we performed nucleophilic addition reactions between
2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a) and halogenated phenols, which resulted in diphenyl ethers 13f and 13g in 80 and 89% yields, respectively.
We also carried out the reaction between 2-bromophenol and compound 7a on a gram scale (10 mmol), which provided diphenyl ether 13g in 46% yield. The reactions using 4,5-dimethyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7b) led to compounds 13h–13j in yields of 26 to 76%. As expected,
the reaction performed with 4-methoxyphenol showed lower yield compared
to the reaction carried out with 4-nitrophenol. We allowed phenol
to react with 4,5-difluoro-2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7c), and we did not obtain compound 13k. In this experiment, the attack of phenol on the sulfur atom of
the silylaryl benzenesulfonate 7c presumably led to the
formation of phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (14) in
a considerable amount according to GC/MS analysis (Table 2).

We performed reactions
with 3-methoxy-2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7d), which resulted in O-arylation products 13l and 13m in 51 and 92% yields, respectively.
These reactions were highly regioselective, and mixtures of regioisomers
were not detected (GC/MS). When the reaction was carried out using
3,4-dimethoxy-2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7e), we obtained diphenyl ethers 13n and 13o in 55 and 78% yields, respectively. These reactions were
also highly regioselective, and mixtures of regioisomers were not
detected (GC/MS). In addition to the reactions with phenols, we performed
the nucleophilic addition reaction between 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
benzenesulfonate (7a) and aniline (20a),
which is a stronger nucleophile than phenol, resulting in diphenylamine
(13p) in 27% yield. When benzoic acid (21) was used as the nucleophile, we obtained phenyl benzoate (13q) in 28% yield. We subjected benzamide (22) to a nucleophilic addition reaction with 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
benzenesulfonate (7a); however, the product of interest 13r was not obtained. When benzenesulfonic acid (23) was used as the nucleophile, compound 13s was obtained
in less than 5% yield (Table 2).

Next, we subjected 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates
(7) to [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with alkyl azides 25 and aryl azides 26 to obtain cycloadducts 27.8,22 Azides 25 and 26 were prepared according to the procedures described in
the literature (Scheme 6).23−25

Scheme 6 Preparation of Alkyl Azides 25a–25d and Aryl Azides 26a–26d
The [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction
between benzyl azide (25a) and 1.5 equiv of 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a) was performed in the presence
of 3 equiv of CsF, 1 equiv of 18-crown-6 ether, and 1 equiv of Cs2CO3 in PhCN at 80 °C for 24 h, and benzotriazole 27a was obtained in 60% yield. When the same transformation
was carried out without the addition of Cs2CO3, we obtained benzotriazole 27a also in 60% yield. The
optimal conditions for the [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between
azides 25–26 and 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonates (7) were evaluated in the preparation
of cycloadducts 27 (Table 3).

Azide (25–26) (0.25 mmol), 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl

PhCN (4 mL) were maintained under stirring at 80 °C for 24 h.

b Isolated yield.

The reactions using alkyl azides 25 and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7a) led to the formation of benzotriazoles 27a–27d in yields of 58 to 63%. When the [3 + 2]
cycloaddition reaction was performed between benzyl azide (25a) and 4,5-dimethyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7b), we obtained benzotriazole 27e in 52%
yield. However, when the reaction was carried out between benzyl azide
(25a) and 4,5-difluoro-2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7c), the cycloadduct 27f was isolated in
only 25% yield. In the reaction performed between benzyl azide (25a) and 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates 7d and 7e, we obtained benzotriazoles 27g and 27h in yields of 53 and 56%, respectively. These
reactions were highly regioselective, and mixtures of regioisomers
were not detected (GC/MS). When the reaction between phenyl azide
(26a) and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7a) was carried out, benzotriazole 27i was
obtained in 50% yield. The [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between
substituted aryl azides 26b–26d and
compound 7a gave benzotriazoles 27j–27l in yields of 31 to 80%. The lower yield obtained for compound 27l is ascribed to the use of the sterically hindered ortho-substituted azide 26d (Table 3).

In addition to reactions
with azides 25 and 26, we performed [4 +
2] cycloaddition reactions between furans 28 and 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl
benzenesulfonates (7),8,10 and the results
achieved are presented in Table 4.

a Reaction conditions:
Furan (28) (0.25 mmol), 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7a–7e) (0.375 mmol), CsF (0.75 mmol), and 18-crown-6
ether (0.25 mmol) in PhCN (4 mL) were maintained under stirring at
80 °C for 24 h.

b Isolated
yield.

The reactions using
furans 28 and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7a) resulted in cycloaddition adducts 29a–29c in yields of 69 to 77%. When the [4 + 2]
cycloaddition reaction was performed between furan and 4,5-dimethyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7b), the cycloaddition adduct 29d was obtained in 63% yield. However, when the reaction
was carried out between furan and 4,5-difluoro-2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (7c), the cycloadduct 29e was obtained in only 11% yield. When the [4 + 2] cycloaddition
reaction was performed between furan and 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates 7d and 7e, the cycloaddition adducts 29f and 29g were obtained in yields of 75 and 69%, respectively
(Table 4).

To
highlight the applicability of 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates
(7), we employed 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate
(7a) in the total synthesis of the alkaloid (±)-aporphine
(34).1e,26 Initially, we prepared 1-methylene-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 31 from amine 30, as described in the literature.1e,26 Then, we subjected compound 31 to the reaction with
compound 7a in the presence of 3 equiv of CsF and 1 equiv
of 18-crown-6 ether in PhCN at 80 °C for 24 h, which led to the
formation of intermediate 32 in 47% yield. Subsequently,
compound 32 was subjected to a basic hydrolysis reaction,1e,26 resulting in (±)-noraporphine (33) in 48% yield.
Then, we carried out the N-methylation reaction of
intermediate 33 using formaldehyde and sodium borohydride,1e,26 and the alkaloid (±)-aporphine (34) was obtained
in 78% yield (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Total Synthesis of Alkaloid (±)-Aporphine (34)
Conclusions
In
summary, 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates were obtained
by well-established synthetic routes and emerged as a novel class
of aryne precursors, allowing the formation of benzyne and its derivatives
under mild conditions. The novel aryne precursors were obtained from
phenols and 4-chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride, an inexpensive and easy-to-handle
reagent with relatively low toxicity that was used as a substitute
for the trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. All the aryne precursors
obtained were subjected to nucleophilic addition reactions, providing
addition products in yields of 24 to 92%, and to cycloaddition reactions,
affording cycloadducts in yields up to 80%. In addition, 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonate was successfully employed in the total synthesis
of (±)-aporphine. During the development of this novel class
of aryne precursors, we assumed a concerted mechanism for the generation
of arynes from 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl triflates and proposed a polar
mechanism for the generation of arynes from 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonates. The chemistry reported here complements
the classic methods for the generation of arynes and can be applied
to the syntheses of molecules with interesting biological properties
and to the preparations of useful functional materials.

General Information
The 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on spectrometers operating at
500 or 300 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on spectrometers
operating at 125 or 75 MHz. The 1H NMR spectra were taken
in deuterated solvents, and the chemical shifts were given in parts
per million with respect to tetramethylsilane (TMS) used as an internal
standard. The 13C NMR spectra were taken in deuterated
solvents, and the chemical shifts were given in parts per million
with respect to the deuterated solvent used as a reference. The infrared
spectra were obtained using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) or
KBr pellets in the 4000–400 cm–1 region.
The mass spectra were carried out employing a gas chromatograph connected
to a mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization at 70 eV.

Procedure for Nucleophilic Addition Reaction
with Arynes17
To a vial (10 mL)
were added the appropriate nucleophiles 8, 20a, and 21–23 (0.25 mmol), the appropriate
2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl 4-chlorobenzenesulfonates 7a–7e (0.375 mmol), 18-crown-6 ether (0.25 mmol, 66.0 mg), cesium
carbonate (0.25 mmol, 81.5 mg), anhydrous benzonitrile (4 mL), and
cesium fluoride (0.75 mmol, 114 mg). The vial was capped, and the
mixture was maintained under magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 24
h. Afterward, a saturated sodium chloride solution (20 mL) was added
to the mixture, which was extracted with ethyl ether (3 × 20
mL). The organic phase was dried over MgSO4. After filtration,
the ethyl ether was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the benzonitrile
was removed by horizontal distillation under vacuum. The residue obtained
was purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography with silica
gel using an appropriate eluent, affording the nucleophilic addition
products 13a–13s.

Procedure for the [4 + 2] Cycloaddition Reaction with Arynes8,10
To a vial (10 mL) were added the appropriate 2-(trimethylsilyl)aryl
4-chlorobenzenesulfonates 7a–7e (0.375
mmol), 18-crown-6-ether (0.25 mmol, 66.0 mg), anhydrous benzonitrile
(4 mL), cesium fluoride (0.75 mmol, 114 mg), and the appropriate furan 28 (0.25 mmol). The vial was capped, and the mixture was maintained
under magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 24 h. Afterward, a saturated
sodium chloride solution (20 mL) was added to the mixture, which was
extracted with ethyl ether (3 × 20 mL). The organic phase was
dried over MgSO4. After filtration, the ethyl ether was
evaporated under reduced pressure, and the benzonitrile was removed
by horizontal distillation under vacuum. The residue obtained was
purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography with silica gel
using an appropriate eluent to afford the cycloadducts 29a–29g.
