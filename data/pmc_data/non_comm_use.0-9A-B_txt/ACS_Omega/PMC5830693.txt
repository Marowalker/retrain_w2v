In this work, we explore the use
of electrochemical methods (i.e.,
impedance) along with the arsenic-specific aptamer (ArsSApt) to fabricate
and study the interfacial properties of an arsenic (As(III)) sensor.
The ArsSApt layer was self-assembled on a gold substrate, and upon
binding of As(III), a detectable change in the impedimetric signal
was recorded because of conformational changes at the interfacial
layer. These interfacial changes are linearly correlated with the
concentration of arsenic present in the system. This target-induced
signal was utilized for the selective detection of As(III) with a
linear dynamic range of 0.05–10 ppm and minimum detectable
concentrations of ca. 0.8 μM. The proposed system proved to
be successful mainly because of the combination of a highly sensitive
electrochemical platform and the recognized specificity of the ArsSApt
toward its target molecule. Also, the interaction between the ArsSApt
and the target molecule (i.e., arsenic) was explored in depth. The
obtained results in this work are aimed at proving the development
of a simple and environmentally benign sensor for the detection of
As(III) as well as in elucidating the possible interactions between
the ArsSApt and arsenic molecules.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Arsenic
is an extremely toxic substance commonly found in surface
and groundwater due to both natural and anthropogenic sources.1,2 The toxicity of arsenic is dependent on the oxidation state of the
species, with arsenites (i.e., arsenic trioxide, As3+)
and arsenates (arsenic pentoxide, As5+) being the most
toxic forms.3,4 Such species are found in well
drinking water and have been the cause of about 300 000 deaths
from cancer in Bangladesh alone.5,6 Undoubtedly, ingestion
of inorganic arsenic is an important public health problem worldwide.
In 2001, the US Environmental Protection Agency set the minimum contaminant
level for arsenic to 10 ppb, recognizing the deleterious effects of
arsenic on humans. Consequently, developing methods for the safe detection
of this substance in water at the levels of compliance (10 ppb according
to WHO) is a pressing need.

Currently, the accurate and reliable
measurement of inorganic arsenic
requires the use of expensive equipment and facilities (e.g., ICP–MS,
HPLC–ICP–MS, and ASV among others).6 Thus, the use of arsenic field test kits could greatly
help public health programs to identify high arsenic exposure immediately
at the water source. The arsenic field test kits provide advantages
such as low cost, on-site measurement, rapid alerts, and limited training
costs. However, the on-site inorganic arsenic measurement
in water possesses a major challenge because the most common field
test kits commercially available are known to lack the sensitivity
and reproducibility necessary and are mostly based on the Gutzeit
method that generates the extremely toxic arsine gas. In 2006, Steinmaus
and co-workers found that two of the most commonly used field test
kits (i.e., Hach EZ and Quick Arsenic) were able to provide flexibility
and portability but were not sensitive enough to comply with the USEPA
and WHO guideline value of 10 ppb. This research led to the conclusion
that both kits could be extremely useful to accurately and rapidly
report arsenic concentrations above 15 ppb.7 Nonetheless, the use of electrochemical sensors has demonstrated
to be a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of target molecules
in relevant environments.8−10 Particularly, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a useful technique to achieve label-free
operation, which enables the detection of target–probe binding
in real time.8,11,12 Also, this electrochemical method provides information of the surface
properties of the system because it allows effective measurement the
electrode’s resistance and the resistance of the ionic transfer
through the interfacial layer after any binding or interfacial event.13,14

Thus, because of the recognized deleterious effects that inorganic
arsenic can pose in human health, the opportunity to develop a selective
impedimetric sensor is foreseen. A possible strategy to achieve such
a goal relies on the use of arsenic-binding aptamers. Aptamers are
in vitro-selected single-stranded DNA or RNA, which are promising
tools to detect contaminants and other molecules mainly due to the
demonstrated superior target recognition capabilities over other biomolecules
(antibodies, peptides, etc.).15 Particularly,
aptamers have emerged as an important aid in environmental monitoring
as it has allowed for real-time and on-site detection of heavy metals.16 In 2009, Kim et al. first reported the use of
an arsenic-binding aptamer for the removal of inorganic arsenic from
Vietnamese groundwater.14 The 100-mer oligonucleotide
aptamer with As(III) high affinity, (5′GGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATACCAGCTTATTCAATTTTACAGAACAACCAACGTCGCTCCGGGTACTTCTTCATCGAGATAGTAAGTGCAATCT-3′),
has been used to remove the most lethal forms of arsenic, As(III)
and As(V), from water. In fact, complete removal was achieved after
exposing the selected aptamer to arsenic for 5 min to arsenic solutions
ranging from 0.5 to 30 ppb. The authors ascribe this great removal
capacity to the high selectivity and specificity of the aptamer toward
the target, and the dissociation constant for As(III) and As(V) was
determined to be 7.05 and 4.95 nM, respectively.

In this work,
a label-free impedimetric aptasensor using the arsenic-specific
aptamer (ArsSApt) was developed and tested by immobilizing the ArsSApt
on a gold electrode and further exposing the system to As(III). The
electrochemical capability of the aptasensor was determined via a
label-free approach by studying the charge-transfer resistance across
the electrode using a redox probe. The decreasing resistance through
the aptamer layer with the increasing arsenic concentration served
as an indicator of the ArsSApt–As(III) interaction and As(III)
detection. Cui et al. observed a similar behavior of the aptamer when
developing a sensor based on the differential pulse voltammetry technique.17 Nevertheless, herein, we present a first approach
toward using an impedimetric technique to study the performance and
deepen the fundamental understanding of the molecular interaction
of the aptamer with inorganic arsenic. The results presented in this
research would allow the development of point-of-use sensors without
the generation of toxic byproducts and acceptable sensitivity and
selectivity toward inorganic arsenic(III).

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Materials
Gold-coated electrodes
were purchased from LGA Thin Films Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). The electrodes
are prepared by in situ sputter etch followed by sputter deposition
of 10 nm Ti and 100 nm Au onto polished Si wafers as per vendor specification.
Potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4), potassium
phosphate dibasic (K2HPO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, TraceSELECT Ultra, ≥95% (T)), nitric
acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride
(KCl), potassium hydroxide (KOH), potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6), potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6), sodium meta-arsenite (NaAsO2), sodium arsenate
dibasic heptahydrate (Na2HAsO4·7H2O), and all other chemicals used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(USA) and used without further purification. An SP-150 potentiostat/galvanostat
in a low-current mode with EIS capabilities from BioLogic USA, along
with a common glass three-electrode cell system, was used for all
electrochemical procedures. The gold-coated substrates were used as
the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (0.197 vs NHE) as the reference electrode,
and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The ArsSApt was purchased
from Integrated DNA Technologies with a thiolated anchoring group
(C6-SH). The ArsSApt sequence was previously determined by Kim et
al.,14 and it was purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies with a modification in the 5′ terminal: 5′SH-MC6-D/TTACAGAACAACCAACGTCGCTCCGGGTACTTCTTCATCG-3′,
and only using the selective portion of the sequence. A random sequence
was also purchased for comparison purposes and as a selectivity measure:
5′SH-MC6-D/GCATTCAAGGGCATTCAAGGGCATTCAAGGGCATTCAAGG-3′.
Nanopure water (18.2 MΩ·cm2, Milli-Q Direct
16) was used at all times.

2.2 Immobilization of ArsSApt
onto Gold Electrodes
and Arsenic-Binding Experiments
The ArsSApt was first solubilized
in a Tris–EDTA buffer solution and deprotected using 1:1 v/v
dilution of the aptamer solution with 20 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
hydrochloride for 1 h, following the protocols published by Base Pair
Biotechnologies, Inc. Thereafter, the ArsSApt was allowed to react
with the gold substrate for a 2 h period, and the surface was washed
with buffer solution several times. After aptamer immobilization,
arsenic solutions of different concentrations ranging from 0.05 to
200 ppm were incubated in different electrodes containing the immobilized
ArsSApt. This reaction was allowed to occur for 4 h, and then, the
electrodes were washed several times before proceeding with the electrochemical
experiments.

2.3 EIS Experiments for the
Sensor
To
evaluate the performance of the aptamer-based sensor, EIS was used
to determine the resistance across the electrochemical double layer
for all electrodes. In brief, EIS experiments were carried out at Eoc against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in
all cases with an alternating voltage amplitude of 10 mV, with a frequency
range from 0.1 kHz to 0.11 Hz at 30 points per decade in a 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6/5 mM K4Fe(CN)6/0.1
M KCl solution as the redox probe.

2.4 Physical
Characterization of Gold–ArsSApt
Electrodes
Infrared spectra of substrates were recorded on
a Thermo Scientific Nicolet Continuum infrared (IR) instrument in
a transmittance mode from 400 to 4000 cm–1, with
4 cm–1 resolution and an accumulation of 32 scans.
The thickness of the ArsSApt layer and chemistry was evaluated using
an infrared variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (IR-VASE—Mark
II, J.A. Woollam Co., Inc. IR-VASE, Lincoln, Nebraska). Data were
collected using a DTGS detector in the range of 230–8000 cm–1, a bandwidth of 0, sample type as isotropic, zone
average polarizer, and single position RCE analyzer. To obtain thickness,
data were collected at an angle of incidence of 80°, a spectral
resolution of 4 cm–1, and 500 scans. For IR, data
were collected at an angle of incidence of 70°, a spectral resolution
of 16 cm–1, and 15 scans (data not shown). The WVASE32
software within the IR-VASE was used to analyze the aptamer thickness.
The collected data were fitted to ellipsometric models that are a
function of film thickness and optical constants (n, k). A model was created containing layers for
the underlying silicon wafer, titanium (used as an adhesion layer
for gold), gold, and an infrared general oscillating layer (genosc_ir)
to model the aptamer. The thickness was displayed in nanometers, and
the mean-squared error (MSE) and depolarization were observed to be
closest to zero. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted
to ascertain the gold–thiol formation between the aptamer and
the gold substrate. XPS binding energy was obtained using a PHI 5600
spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα mono- and polychromatic
X-ray source operating at 15 kV, 350 W, and pass energy of 58.70 eV.
All binding energies reported were corrected using the carbon 1s peak
(C 1s) at 284.8 eV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was utilized to
assess the interface of the gold substrates before and after the immobilization
of the ArsSApt. The AFM utilized is a MultiMode scanning probe microscope
and Software: NanoScope (version 8.15) in the tapping mode (tip: TAP150A),
with a scan size of 5 μm at a 0.5 Hz scan rate.

2.5 Physical Characterization of an ArsSApt +
As(III) System
Malvern ZetaSizer Nano series with 4 mW 632.8
nm laser was used to determine the average apparent hydrodynamic diameter
of aptamer–arsenic colloids. In this case, the aptamer was
utilized without the thiol modification in the 5′ terminal
(5′-TTACAGAACAACCAACGTCGCTCCGGGTACTTCTTCATCG-3′). First,
suspensions were sufficiently diluted with deionized water to avoid
agglomeration. Then, approximately 1 mL of suspension was added to
a disposable plastic cuvette. The backscattering mode was used in
triplicate for all the samples, and the z-average
(i.e., hydrodynamic radius) and polydispersity index (PDI) were recorded.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810
(Jasco, Inc., Easton, MD) spectropolarimeter interfaced with a computer.
The CD spectra of the 5 μM aptamer (no-thiol modification) were
analyzed from 200 to 300 nm. The data gathered were the average of
three scans at a scanning rate of 10 nm/min. The scan of the buffer
recorded at room temperature was subtracted from the average scans
for each sample run.

Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectra were recorded
in a Bruker AVANCE III HD spectrometer operating at a 1H Larmor frequency of 700 MHz and suited with a QCI cryoprobe optimized
for proton detection. One-dimensional excitation sculpting 1H spectra were acquired for two samples of 5 μM aptamer (no-thiol
modification), with and without arsenite. The samples contained 10%
D2O for field locking and were measured at 298 K. Each
spectrum was the average of 2048 transients recorded with a 2 s recycle
delay, 60 μs dwell time, and 492 ms acquisition period.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Optimization of Sensing
Conditions
In the context of the development of a sensor,
it was important to
obtain correct conditions to prevent agglomeration of the aptamer
layer. To obtain this information, dynamic light scattering (DLS)
was employed for aptamer concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 μM
(Figure 1). DLS results
show enlarged apparent hydrodynamic diameter for the 0.01 μM
(314 nm, PDI: 0.553) and 10 μM (900 nm, PDI: 0.764) solutions,
suggesting sample aggregation likely due to DNA backbone interactions.
These samples also presented a higher PDI than the 5 μM (132
nm, PDI: 0.389) sample, providing evidence that an intermediate aptamer
concentration of 5 μM would be beneficial as a starting condition
for immobilization. DLS plots were also obtained for ArsSApt concentrations
of 0.5 and 1 μM (Figure S1). Parallel
to DLS, surface zeta potentials were also recorded for the same samples
to determine the stability of the dispersions and are presented in Figure S2.

Figure 1 Hydrodynamic radius results of increasing
the ArsSApt concentration
by means of DLS. Measured concentrations are 0.01, 5, and 10 μM
and the obtained average sizes are 314, 132, and 900 nm, respectively.

3.2 Interaction
between ArsSApt and As(III)
The interaction between ArsSApt
and As(III) was initially studied
by means of CD, a tool to determine protein and nucleic acid structural
conformations. The spectra for both 5 μM ArsSApt and ArsSApt
with 100 ppm arsenic (ArsSApt + As) were obtained and compared (Figure 2). Both spectra presented
a negative peak at around 245 nm and a positive peak at 220 and 280
nm, which are both in accordance with previous CD reports of the arsenic–aptamer
complex.17,18 These signals are known to represent the
most common helical B-form of DNA.19−21 Nonetheless, after the
addition of As(III), both peaks decreased indicating a conformational
change of the aptamer when in contact with arsenic. These changes
are the result of interfered bases from the transition of strong π–π
interactions of the bases with deoxyribose.18 Such results not only confirm As(III) binding to the ArsSApt but
also demonstrate that a conformational change is occurring, which
provides further elucidation on the origin of the impedimetric response
that is observed in the electrochemical experiments. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were also obtained as an attempt to pin point
changes in functional groups and structural conformations once the
ArsSApt binds As(III) (Figure S3).

Figure 2 CD spectra
of 5 μM ArsSApt in the absence and presence of
100 ppm As(III).

Solution NMR is a powerful
method to obtain atomic-level structural
and dynamical information of challenging biomolecular systems such
as DNA aptamers. Figure 3 compares the amino proton region of NMR spectra of the ArsSApt in
solution without and with 100 ppm As(III). These 1H signals
arise from the aptamer nitrogen bases and are therefore highly sensitive
to changes in molecular conformation or in interactions such as hydrogen
bonding. The spectral comparison reveals substantial chemical shift
perturbations in the ArsSApt (highlighted by the inset in Figure 3), consistent with
an overall conformational change upon As binding. In addition, a slight
increase in line width can be observed, which is likely a result of
intermediate motions due to intermolecular interactions. Furthermore,
the observation of new signals such as that seen at 8.58 ppm indicates
the formation of specific interactions in the ArsSApt + As(III) complex.
In our experimental conditions, no imino protons were observed because
of the chemical exchange with the solvent. These high-resolution NMR
data are thus consistent with a mechanism in which specific intermolecular
interactions in the ArsSApt + As(III) complex result in changes to
the overall aptamer structure in solution. Because the aptamer is
only terminally bound to the gold electrode in the sensor, ArsSApt
+ As(III) interactions and conformational changes are anticipated
to occur in the solid-phase sensor similar to those detected in solution.

ArsSApt in the absence (top) and presence (bottom) of 100 ppm As(III),
recorded at 700 MHz 1H frequency. The inset highlights
chemical shift perturbations, indicative of a conformational change
in the aptamer upon binding.

To further explore the properties of the interfacial layer
over
the electrode, a systematic study utilizing XPS was executed. High-resolution
spectra of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and arsenic (As)
were obtained for three samples: bare electrode, electrode containing
the aptamer, and the electrode with arsenic bound to the aptamer (Figure 4). The XPS P 2p high-resolution
spectrum showed a peak at 133 eV only for the samples containing the
ssDNA aptamer.22,23 The peak observed for these samples
refers to the phosphate groups present in the aptamer’s backbone.
Also, the XPS peak in the N 1s binding energy, 400 eV, ascertains
the presence of the nitrogenous bases of the aptamer on the sensor’s
surface.24,25 The S 2p peak at 162.5 eV refers to a Au–S
bond that ensures the linking between the thiol-modified aptamer and
the gold surface, which is in fact absent for the bare electrode.26,27 The 44.8 eV signal only observed in sample C indicates the presence
of arsenic (As(III)) on the electrode.28 This intense arsenic peak, present even after washing with copious
amounts of buffer, is indicative of a strong interaction between the
ArsSApt and As(III) that may result irreversible in nature. Au and
C high-resolution spectra were also obtained for all three samples
(Figure S4).

of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), sulfur
(S), and arsenic (As) for three samples: (A) bare Au electrode, (B)
ArsSApt-immobilized electrode, and (C) ArsSApt + As(III)-bound electrode.

3.3 Sensor
Preparation
Once the intermediate
aptamer concentration of 5 μM was selected in section 3.1, we conducted a study to
determine the optimum aptamer concentration for immobilization onto
the electrode surface. EIS of the electrodes with aptamer concentrations
ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM was obtained, and the resistance of
the working electrode was determined (Figure 5A). The highest aptamer detection was observed
for the 5 μM electrode, referring to a higher aptamer concentration
on the electrode surface. A dramatic decrease in resistance is observed
when the aptamer concentration is doubled, suggesting that the aggregation
observed in Figure 1 may result in decreased immobilization of the aptamer on the gold
surface. According to the obtained results, the optimal aptamer concentration
for immobilization and further arsenic detection was established to
be 5 μM.

Figure 5 Effect of (A) ArsSApt concentration for aptasensor preparation
and (B) As(III) binding time on aptasensor performance. EIS experiments
were carried out at Eoc against an Ag/AgCl
reference electrode in all cases with an alternating voltage amplitude
of 10 mV, with a frequency range from 0.1 kHz to 0.11 Hz at 30 points
per decade in a 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6/5 mM K4Fe(CN)6/0.1 M KCl solution as the redox probe.

Another parameter optimized was the time of incubation
of arsenic(III)
within the aptamer–electrode system: binding time (Figure 5B). In this study,
electrodes were prepared with 5 μM aptamer for immobilization
and were exposed to 50 ppm arsenic. Unique sensors were prepared for
the 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h binding times. As expected, the reaction
time between the ArsSApt and As(III) influenced the response of the
sensor. It is observed that the resistance of the working electrode
decreased gradually with increasing reaction time and reaches a plateau
after 4 h, suggesting that such a timeframe as adequate for the operation
of the sensor.

The immobilization of the ArsSApt on the gold
electrode was confirmed
by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and XPS (Figure 6). CV of a redox probe containing [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– was recorded and compared
to the bare electrode and the aptamer-coated electrode. The voltammogram
of the bare gold electrode is consistent with common gold CV plots
(Figure 6A).29 However, once the aptamer is immobilized on
the gold electrode, the charge-transfer resistance increases dramatically
(Figure 6B), further
confirming the immobilization of an organic layer on the interface
of the electrode.

(5 μM)-covered
gold electrode. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in a three-electrode
cell system at 100 mV/s using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a
platinum wire as the counter electrode in a 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6/5 mM K4Fe(CN)6/0.1 M KCl solution as
the redox probe.

3.4 Electrochemical
Performance
Because
of its studied specificity and high affinity, the ArsSApt was used
as a sensing probe in the electrochemical sensing platform. The electrochemical
performance once exposed to arsenic was then studied by means of EIS.
As shown by the Nyquist plot (Figure 7B), there is a linear decrease in the working electrode’s
resistance with increasing arsenic concentration. A calibration curve
was generated for arsenic concentrations from 0.05 to 10 ppm (Figure 7C). The results proved
that the aptasensor responds linearly between the working electrode
resistance and the logarithm value of the As(III) concentration. The
minimum detectable concentration (MDC) measured by the impedimetric
sensor after 4 h of incubation was 0.05 ppm, and the dynamic range
extends from 0.05 to 10 ppm. The fitted linear equation obtained was y = −172 045x + 914 705
with a correlation coefficient of 0.9972 and a slope standard error
of 4060. The MDC was calculated to be ca. 0.8 μM (i.e., MDC
plus 3 times the error of the measurement, 20%), which is higher than
the World Health Organization guideline of 133 nM (i.e., 10 ppb) but
represents an environmentally friendly method that does not produce
harmful chemicals after the process. These detection limits could
be further improved by modifying the interfacial layer.

increasing arsenic concentration from 0.05 to 10 ppm. (D) Film thickness
results of the aptasensor with varying arsenic concentrations and
(E) AFM images of the bare electrode, ArsSApt-immobilized electrode,
and arsenic-bound electrode.

An important factor influencing the electrochemical behavior
of
the sensor is the packing density of the aptamer molecules on the
surface.30 Therefore, we attribute this
decrease in the EIS signal to a conformational change in the aptamer
layer upon binding to As(III), causing the aptamer chains to reorganize
on the surface. We hypothesize that after the arsenic-binding event
occurs, the aptamer layer compacts because of the strong interaction
with the target molecule, likely leading to a thinner interfacial
layer that results in a lower resistance across the electrochemical
capacitor (Figure 7A). Such a statement can be confirmed by means of ellipsometric analysis
of film thickness. IR-VASE was used to obtain the aptamer thickness
before and after arsenic exposure (Figure 7D). We observe a thickness of 4.474 nm for
the aptamer thickness before arsenic binding. Exposure to arsenic
decreases the aptamer thickness as a function of the As(III) concentration.

Similarly, AFM images of three ArsSApt sensors (bare, ArsSApt,
and ArsSApt + As(III)) could also confirm the decrease in film thickness
when in contact with arsenic (Figure 7E). A significant increase in height is observed after
aptamer immobilization on the gold surface. A slight darkening in
the sample surface is observed with arsenic addition, which refers
to decrease in height yet increase in surface roughness. The roughness
analysis for the bare gold electrode showed a value of 0.568 nm. Once
a homogeneous layer of the aptamer was added on the electrode (ArsSApt
sample), the roughness increased to 3.66 nm, which resulted in less
surface roughness than for the ArsSApt + As(III) sample. The ArsSApt
+ As(III) sample having a roughness of 6.86 nm.

3.5 ArsSApt Selectivity
The specificity
of the sensor was determined by including a series of ions that are
commonly found in water, namely: PO43–, Pb2+, NH4+, Fe3+, Cd2+, K+, Na+, Ni3+, and As5+, at 10 ppm (Figure 8A). In the absence of As(III), we observe changes in resistance
that are certainly because of nonspecific binding of the ions tested
with the aptamer. Upon the addition of AsO2–, there is a large decrease in resistance, analogous to the signal
obtained when detecting arsenic alone. Also, even when testing the
sensor against another arsenic species, As(V), its response remains
specific toward As(III).

aptasensor when exposed to 10 ppm PO43–, Pb2+, NH4+, Fe3+, Cd2+, K+, Na+, Ni3+, As5+, and As3+. The mixture represents a solution
containing 10 ppm of all ions. (B) Impedimetric signal analysis of
the arsenic nonspecific aptasensor (random DNA sequence) when exposed
to varying concentrations of As(III) from 0.1 to 200 ppm.

Another study designed to test the aptamer’s
specificity
toward its target molecule was by using an arsenic nonspecific aptamer
to develop the device. EIS results show a nonlinear and low-signal
detection of the aptamer against the As(III) species (Figure 8B). The observed detection
is likely due to nonspecific binding of arsenic with the aptamer’s
phosphate backbone, although the signal is negligible.

4 Conclusions
In this work, the performance and interfacial
properties of an
ArsSApt bound to an electrode were successfully presented. The aptamer
showed excellent specificity toward arsenic, which was detectable
even with other ions present in solution. By means of ellipsometry
and AFM, we demonstrated interfacial changes that certainly shed light
on the behavior of the aptamer once immobilized on the electrode and
in contact with arsenic. Particularly, we determined that the increasing
arsenic concentration leads to a decrease in the thickness of the
aptamer layer, inducing a decrease in the charge-transfer resistance
of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– to the gold
electrode. Therefore, this detection principle was used to develop
a sensitive and selective arsenic determination method. The proposed
aptasensor showed a linear range from 0.05 to 10 ppm with a correlation
coefficient of 0.9972 and MDCs of 0.8 μM. Also included in this
work is an effort to understand the interfacial properties between
the ArsSApt and As(III). In this sense, NMR results revealed the likelihood
of a mechanism in which specific intermolecular interactions in the
ArsSApt + As(III) complex generates changes to the overall aptamer
structure.
