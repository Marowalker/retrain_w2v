A cellulose
nanocrystal (CNC) sample prepared from chemical pulp
via sulfuric acid hydrolysis procedures has been supplied by InnoTech
Alberta Inc. in the shape of white dry powder as a prototype product.
Some transport coefficients were precisely investigated for the CNC
sample in aqueous suspensions at the room temperature of 25 °C
such as the average rotational and translational diffusion coefficients
(Dr and Dt) and viscoelastic relaxation times (τv) at dilute
conditions. The determined values, Dr ≈
2.3 × 103 s–1 and Dt ≈ 1.0 × 10–11 m2 s–1, using depolarized and usual dynamic light
scattering (DLS) techniques, respectively, proposed the consistent
length and width of L ≈ 170 nm and W ≈ 7.6 nm via a theoretical model for monodisperse
rigid rods dispersed in pure water. The viscoelastic behavior for
aqueous CNC suspensions containing spherical probe particles was examined
using DLS rheological techniques. The obtained value of τv = 1.0 × 10–4 s fairly agrees with
that of (6Dr)−1 ≈
7.4 × 10–5 s. Because the theoretical model
for monodisperse rods denotes the relationship τv = (6Dr)−1, this observation
strongly confirms that the CNC sample behaves as approximately monodisperse
rigid rodlike particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
clearly demonstrated a bimodal distribution in rod length with major
and small minor peaks at ca. 150 and 240 nm, respectively. Then, the
reason for the observed disagreement between the L values resulted from the transport coefficients and the major peak
in TEM images is the presence of the small minor component with L ≈ 240 nm. Consequently, individual nanosize rodlike
crystalline particles in the CNC sample well disperse without forming
large aggregations because of strong interactions and behave as isolated
individual rods in dilute aqueous suspensions.

Introduction
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are nanosize
crystalline rodlike
particles made from cellulose via acid hydrolysis procedures by the
use of several types of acidic agents.1−4 CNCs are highly potential nature base organic
polymeric materials for a wide range of applications such as a high-performance
reinforcement agent in common plastics because of their low density,
ca. 1.6 g cm–3; high strength, ca 10 GPa;5 and high modulus, ca 150 GPa.2,3,6,7 CNCs are also
highly potential materials for optical applications because produced
composites containing CNC particles can be transparent because of
the size of CNC particles less enough than the wavelength of visual
light.8,9 Moreover, it has been well-known that many
kinds of CNCs have the ability to make a liquid crystalline phase
in aqueous suspensions at concentrations higher than critical values
depending on the CNC species.10,11 This liquid-crystalline-forming
feature also fascinates many researchers who work in the field of
basic science and also industrial practical applications.10,11 Moreover, CNCs have a highly promising future to be used in the
fields of food and pharmaceutical industries.12−15 The fact that cellulose is the
most abundant organic materials, that is, biomass, on the globe as
the main component of the plant cell walls, which are generated repeatedly
every year by a vast kind of plants infinitely, should be an important
point to be deeply considered to develop a well-established sophisticated
sustainable society on our globe.2,3,7

CNCs possessing different dimensions and morphologies
are able
to be prepared by choosing the source of cellulose samples, the kind
of hydrolysis acidic agents and conditions.2−4 If one subjects
higher plant cellulose samples originated from, for example, cotton
and ordinary wood pulp to hydrolysis reactions, needle- or spindle-like
CNC particles possessing lengths shorter than a few hundred nanometers
and widths of a few nanometers are prepared.2−4 Enormously long
whiskerlike CNC particles on the order of micrometers in length are
obtained from tunicate and also green algae cellulose by hydrolysis
reactions.2

In this study, we pay
attention to a white dry CNC sample obtained
from wood pulp. InnoTech Alberta Inc. (Edmonton) has started to operate
a CNC pilot plant which can produce CNC samples as prototype products
targeting commercially available products from any fibrous materials
containing a high α-cellulose contentlike chemical pulp. They
say that their CNC samples contain nanosize spindlelike crystalline
particles with a relatively monodisperse length distribution that
maybe based on transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images.16 However, the dispersibility and stability of
CNC samples in aqueous suspensions essentially important for practical
industrial applications are highly dependent on the surface chemistry
of CNC particles controlled by hydrolysis procedures and cannot be
simply rated from only TEM images in general. Here, the distribution
of length (L) and width (W) or diameter
for nanosize spindlelike CNC particles contained in a CNC sample that
was kindly supplied by InnoTech Alberta Inc. were analyzed based on
carefully taken TEM images, and the average, LTEM and WTEM, values and their
standard deviations were also evaluated. Then, transport coefficients
for the commercial prototype CNC sample in dilute aqueous suspensions,
such as rotational and translational diffusion coefficients (Dr and Dt) and viscoelastic
relaxation time (τv), were determined to rate the
dispersibility into aqueous media highly related to the efficiency
of the CNC samples for industrial applications.

The determined
values of Dr, Dt, and τv were used to evaluate
the consistent length, Ltr, and width, Wtr, of the nanosize spindlelike particles contained
in the CNC sample as rodlike ones using a theoretical model for monodisperse
rodlike particles dispersed into viscous fluid.17 The average values of the length and diameter of rodlike
particles, LTEM and WTEM, of the CNC sample were compared with those of Ltr and Wtr. Recently,
theoretical models17 to discuss precisely
the shape and dimension of dispersed particles at extremely dilute
conditions have been established. However, some reported experimental
transport coefficient data obtained at dilute conditions sometimes
contain serious problems because of difficulties of experiments. Correct
transport coefficients evaluated from carefully carried experiments
are necessary to determine Ltr and Wtr precisely. Moreover, experimental studies
to determine correct transport coefficients at dilute conditions are
essential for especially newly obtained particles such as the CNC
sample examined in this study for the investigation of transport and
rheological features of moderate to concentrated suspensions.

Very recently, Mao et al.18 investigated
the size and morphology of the particles contained in the same CNC
sample as we examined. They used several kinds of scattering techniques,
TEM observation, and also dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments
to obtain precise information on the morphology of the CNC particles
and concluded that the length of the CNC particles in the sample derived
from the Dr and Dt data did not coincide with each other. The values of consistent Ltr and Wtr determined
in this study will be compared with their values and discuss the validity
of our Ltr and Wtr.

Results and Discussion
TEM Images
Figure 1 shows a typical TEM image of CNC particles
of the
tested white dry CNC sample, which was highly diluted in water suspension
and stained by the negative staining method. Many highly extended
needle or spindle shape objects, which seem to be individual primary
CNC particles and possess the length, L, and width, W, less than 300 and 20 nm, respectively, are observed in Figure 1. The distribution
of the L and W was quantified in
the form of histograms, as seen in Figure 2. The observed L value shows
the presence of a bimodal distribution: a major peak found at 150
nm and a small minor one at 240 nm. Similar bimodal L distributions in CNC samples were also clearly recognized in the
previous systematic study.4 On the other
hand, the W value has only one sharp peak at 10 nm.
Then, the TEM image shown in Figure 1 looks similar to that previously published as CNC
particles made from chemical pulp via sulfuric acid hydrolysis techniques
including the bimodal distribution of L seen in Figure 2.4,18,19

the CNC sample evaluated from the TEM image, as shown in Figure 1. The LTEM and WTEM values represent
the average L and W, respectively.
Moreover, the Ltr and Wtr represent the consistent values estimated from the
translational and rotational diffusion constants, which will be described
later in detail.

In the case of dried
out cellulose fibril samples made from kinds
of higher plant resources such as softwood and hardwood pulp, ramie,
cotton, and so on, cellulose microfibrils (or microfibril aggregates)
are constructed by numbers of (Iα and Iβ type) crystallites connected sequentially by amorphous (or disordered)
cellulose chain regions along the elongated long-axis direction.2−4,19,20 In the short-axis (or a transverse sectional) direction, microfibrils
(or microfibril aggregates) are constructed by one (or a few) microfibril(s)
formed by, for example, 36–68 β-1,4-glucan chains for
higher plants20,21 (or more β-1,4-glucan chains
depending on the species of source plants21) and held together by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding,
whereas β-1,4 glycoside linkages sustain the rod- or threadlike
structure of cellulose microfibrils in the elongated direction. Then,
it has been widely accepted that most disordered regions existing
every ca 150 nm (approximately) periodically along cellulose microfibrils
are effectively decomposed, and then isolated crystallites (CNC particles)
possessing their length close to 150 nm are generated in the acidic
hydrolysis procedures.20 Moreover, it has
been well-known that a small amount of sulfate (−OSO3–) groups are introduced on the surface of CNC
particles in the procedure of hydrolysis reaction using sulfuric acid,
and the obtained CNC particles demonstrate rather higher dispersibility
in aqueous suspension because of electrostatic repulsion between negatively
charged sulfate groups than CNC particles without any ionic groups
obtained by hydrochloric acids.1−5 Consequently, one might expect high dispersibility for the examined
CNC sample in aqueous suspension as in the form of isolated individual
CNC primary particles, as seen in Figure 1.

The size of the transverse section
of a microfibril formed by 36–68
β-1,4-glucan chains has been discussed by many researchers.2−5,21,22 Ding et al.22 recently estimated the
size to be 3.2 nm × 5.3 nm. The observed W value
for CNC particles in the sample markedly larger than the size of the
microfibril, as seen in Figure 2b, clearly reveals that a couple of microfibrils are still
bundled tightly by strong hydrogen bonding even after the hydrolysis
procedure.

There are two possible explanations following the
bimodal distribution
of the L values observed in Figure 2a. The first explanation is that the amorphous
or disordered regions exist perfectly in order with the constant periodicity
of ca 150 nm along cellulose microfibrils, and the degradation process
of β-1,4 glycoside linkages by hydrolysis reaction is not perfect.
The second explanation is that the periodicity of disordered regions
is not perfect, but the degradation process for glycoside linkages
is perfect. Agarwal et al.23 recently discovered
that crystalline domains are absent in the never-dried native-state
wood cellulose samples based on the Raman spectroscopic data. Moreover,
Horikawa et al.19 very recently claimed
an idea that the disordered regions along dried out cellulose microfibrils
are preferentially resulted from the drying out process of cellulose
samples and are not there in the raw (or wet) native-state cellulose
fibrils. Then, this idea19 is strongly
supported by the discovery by Agarwal et al.23 Then, the latter explanation for the bimodal L distribution
seems plausible.

The average LTEM and WTEM values were evaluated to be
152 and 8.84 nm, respectively,
from the distribution functions, as shown in Figure 2. The standard deviations of the L and W were also calculated to be 34.0
and 2.37 nm, and these values mean the distribution of L and W rather sharp. However, it should be noted
that TEM images obtained by negative-staining methods sometimes provide
slight overestimation in object sizes, especially in the nanometer
range similar to the W values, because of artifacts
due to an essential problem for broad adsorption sites for heavy metal
cations such as uranyl ions to objects in staining processes. Coagulative
aggregation of primary CNC particles in the drying process during
specimen preparation is of course another serious problem.21

Rotational and Translational Diffusion
If suspended
particles into viscous medium fluids have anisotropic structure such
as spindle, rodlike, or rotational ellipsoidal shapes, the rotational
diffusion constants of the particles can be determined by the use
of depolarized DLS measurements.18,24−28 The incident light source is polarized in the vertical, v, direction.
Then, the depolarized, vh, condition is able to be set by placing
a polarizing optical device in the horizontal, h, direction in front
of a photodetector. According to Berne and Pecora,28 the intercept of a plot of the first cumulant (Γ1vh), which is calculated
from the autocorrelation function of scattered light electric field
obtained under the depolarized condition [g1vh(t)] converted from the autocorrelation function of scattered light
intensity [g2vh(t)] via the relationship g1vh(t) = [g2vh(t) – 1]1/2, against the square of the magnitude of scattering vector
(q2) provides the average value of Dr for anisotropic suspended particles in the
manner of Γ1vh|q=0 = 6Dr, that is, the intercept of Γ1vh versus q2. On the other hand, the initial slope of the first cumulant under
the usual DLS condition (Γ1vu) against q2 provides
the average translational diffusion constant of suspended particles
in the manner of Γ1vuq–2|q=0 = Dt, irrespective of the shape
of suspended particles.

The dependencies of Γ1vh and Γ1vu on q2 are plotted in Figure 3 for aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample at the concentrations
of c = 1.0 and 5.0 g L–1. Although the Γ1vh data were relatively
scattered because of low scattering intensity under the depolarized
condition, the intercept, Γ1vh|q=0, was able
to be evaluated irrespective of the c values. Then,
we might conclude that Dr = 2.3 (±0.2)
× 103 s–1 for the nanosized CNC
particles in the sample. On the other hand, the initial slope between
Γ1vu and q2, which is shown with a thin red solid line
in Figure 3, provides
the translational diffusion constant, Dt = 1.0 (±0.1) × 10–11 m2 s–1. Moreover, it seems that the slope between Γ1vh and q2 shown with a blue thin broken line is identical to the
value of Dt. This observation is confirmed
theoretically because the relation Γ1vh = 6Dr + Dtq2 has been derived
theoretically.24−28

Figure 3 Square
of the magnitude of the scattering vector, q2, dependencies of first cumulants under the usual DLS
condition, Γ1vu, and depolarized DLS condition, Γ1vh, of the autocorrelation functions
of scattered light electric field, g1vu(t) and g1vh(t), for aqueous suspensions
of the CNC sample at two concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 g L–1.

In the case of the usual DLS condition,
the q2 dependence of the Γ1vu data approached
that of Γ1vh in the high q2 range examined, as shown
in Figure 3. If one
ignores coupling between
rotational and translation motions, the first cumulant, Γ1vu, calculated from
the autocorrelation function of the scattered light electric field
under the usual DLS condition, g1vu(t), can be
approximately described as follows 1  where S0 and S1 mean dynamic structure factors depending on
the magnitude of the scattering vector, |q|.28 Because the value of S0 is much greater than that of S1 at small scattering angles leading to low |q| value conditions, the relationship Γ1vu = Dtq2 holds as described above.
However, it is expected that the value of S1 increases gradually with increasing |q| and becomes much greater than that of S0 at higher scattering angles. At the condition satisfying |q|L > 3, where L means the length of rodlike particles, the same relationship
Γ1vu = Dtq2 + 6Dr as Γ1vh holds in accordance with Berne and Pecora.28 The fairly good agreement between the Γ1vu and Γ1vh data observed
at q2 > 8 × 1014 m–2, as shown in Figure 1, reconfirms that the nanosize CNC particles of the
tested sample possess the average values of Dr = 2.3 (±0.2) × 103 s–1 and Dt = 1.0 (±0.1) × 10–11 m2 s–1, respectively,
as characteristic transport coefficients in dilute aqueous suspensions.

Evaluation of Length and Diameter
Methods to evaluate
the length, L, and width, W, of
monodisperse rodlike particles dispersed in a viscous fluid have been
established based on theoretical models taking account of the hydrodynamic
end effect of rodlike particles using numerical calculation methods.17,29,30 Then, the Dr and Dt values can be calculated
as functions of L and W in an explicit
form. Both of the Dr and Dt values are referred to determine consistent L and W precisely. According to TEM images
which have been described in detail in a previous section, the values
of L and W for individual primary
CNC particles distributed in a range from 100 to 300 and 5 to 10 nm,
respectively. Then, the values of Dr and Dt were calculated in the range, as shown in Figure 4, at 25 °C assuming
water as a medium fluid. If one assumes a W value
ranged from 7 to 8 nm, both of the experimental Dr and Dt values are perfectly
reproduced by an identical L value close to 170 nm
simultaneously.

Figure 4 Dependencies of rotational and translational diffusion
constants, Dr and Dt, on the
length, L, of monodisperse rodlike particles suspended
into water at the temperature, T = 25 °C, theoretically
calculated assuming several width, W, such as 6 (a),
7 (b), 8 (c), and 9 nm (d), respectively.17 Both of the experimental Dr and Dt values shown with dotted lines are simultaneously
reproduced with L ≈ 170 nm, only if the condition
7 < W < 8 nm is satisfied.

Then, the consistent Ltr and Wtr values, which reasonably satisfy both of
the experimental Dt and Dr determined for the CNC sample in this study, are determined
to be 170 and 7.6 nm, respectively, and fairly agree with the values
of LTEM and WTEM, as shown in Figure 2. Differences between the values, Ltr and Wtr, and the TEM average ones, LTEM and WTEM, are
calculated to be +21 and −1.6 nm, respectively. The reason
for the 14% increment found in the Ltr from LTEM should be the presence of
the small minor component with its length of L =
240 nm. Because the depolarized DLS (DDLS) and DLS techniques used
in this study provide the weight average Dr and Dt in general, the presence of the
minor component of L = 240 nm possessing higher weight
than the main component of L = 150 nm slightly increases
the Ltr value than the LTEM value, which is simply calculated as the number average.
On the other hand, the reason for the substantial decrement of 19%
found in the Wtr from WTEM is not clear at present. Because the transport quantities, Dr and Dt, determined
in dilute aqueous suspensions strongly assure a high dispersibility
of the examined CNC sample into water, uncontrollable processes in
the drying and staining procedure during specimen preparation for
TEM observation possibly induce some artifacts increasing the LTEM value, such as coagulation of primary CNC
particles and excess smearing. Consequently, we might conclude that
CNC particles originated from the examined sample well-disperse in
dilute aqueous suspension individually, as shown in Figure 1.

Elazzouzi-Hafraoui
et al.21 reported
the so-called cross-sectional plots obtained from small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) experiments for aqueous suspensions of some CNC
samples. The obtained cross-sectional plot for Avicel, which is a
commercial CNC sample, resulted from wood pulp via hydrolysis procedure
using hydrochloric acid and is believed to possess size and structural
characteristics similar to the CNC sample examined in this study,
showing that its cross-sectional radius of gyration is ca. 3.8 nm.
This observation strongly reveals that the average width of CNC particles
of Avicel in aqueous suspensions is estimated to be ca. 7.6 nm by
SAXS techniques, which is identical to the Wtr value determined above.

Viscoelastic Behavior
Modified DLS measurements31,32 were carried to obtain
dynamic viscoelastic behavior of aqueous
suspensions of the CNC sample including a small amount of monodisperse
spherical probe particles possessing the diameter of d = 300 nm. When the probe particles are dispersed in pure water,
they show Brownian motions caused by thermal agitation, feeling only
the water viscosity. However, the probe particles dispersed into a
viscoelastic medium would demonstrate other types of Brownian motions
feeling the viscoelastic properties of the medium even under the same
thermal agitation. The aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample examined
in this study were not completely transparent but slightly opaque.
Then, the probe particle concentration of 1.5 × 10–2 g L–1 was chosen to get enough scattering intensity
to form individual probe particles. It should be noted that the radius
of the probe particles was correctly determined as a monodisperse
value in a pure water suspension at the same concentration. According
to previous studies, the time dependence of g1vu(t) resulted from the Brownian motions of the probe particles dispersed
into a liquid medium is directly related to the t dependence of creep compliance, J(t), of the liquid medium via an equation given below 2  where kB and T means
the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature.31,32 In the case of pure water as a suspending medium for the probe particles, J(t) was proportional to t with a slope of the reciprocal of water viscosity (ηw = 0.885 × 10–3 Pa s at 25 °C). Because
the aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample examined in this study were
ranged in a very dilute regime, the determined J(t) data looked similar to that of the suspending medium,
water. However, careful data analysis allowed us to recognize that
the probe particles dispersed into the CNC suspensions did not provide J(t) simply proportional to t over the entire time region observed, as observed in water. This
observation manifested that the aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample
are viscoelastic. In accordance with the generalized Voigt–Kelvin
model, J(t) for viscoelastic liquids
(without instantaneous compliance) can be described with the summation
of the component of zero shear viscosity (η0) and
a certain necessary number of retardation processes possessing sets
of retardation strength (Jj) and time (λj), respectively,
for a mode j as given below.32,33 3  

In the case of the
dilute aqueous suspensions
of the CNC sample, only one retardation process was enough to describe J(t) – tη0–1 data approximately for each concentration
sample examined, as seen in Figure 5. The obtained J(t) curves were able to be converted to complex compliance (J* = J′ – iJ″, i; imaginary unit, J′; storage
compliance, and J″; loss compliance) via Fourier
transformation in general.32,33 Then, J′ and J″ are given as functions of
the angular frequency (ω) using the determined retardation parameters, J1 and λ1, as 4  

Figure 5 Dependence of J(t) – tη0–1 data on time, t, for the aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample at c = 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g L–1 obtained by
using DLS viscoelastic measurements. Solid lines imply the fit retardation
curves to experimental data with one set of retardation strength, J1, and time, λ1, for each suspension
as 2.3 × 10–3 Pa–1 and 1.0
× 10–4 s (c = 1.0 g L–1), 5.6 × 10–3 Pa–1 and 1.0 × 10–4 s (c = 2.0
g L–1), and 9.0 × 10–3 Pa–1 and 1.1 × 10–4 s (c = 3.0 g L–1), respectively.

Finally, the complex modulus (G* = G′ + iG″, G′;
storage modulus, G″; loss modulus) can be
calculated employing the relationship G* = (J*)−1.33

Figure 6a shows
the dependencies of the converted G′ and G″ – η∞ω moduli
on ω for the aqueous system of the CNC sample at c = 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g L–1. All of the obtained
viscoelastic spectra, G′ and G″ versus ω, for the system were well-described with
a Maxwell model with a set of relaxation strength (G) and time (τv) and the high frequency limiting
viscosity (η∞) as given by 5  

Figure 6 (a)

and G″ – η∞ω for aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample at c = 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g L–1, (b) concentration, c, dependencies of G, η0, and η∞ for the aqueous suspension of the
CNC sample. Solid lines mean the theoretically calculated values proposing
the Dr determined by DDLS techniques under
the depolarized condition.

The concentration, c, dependencies of G, η0 (=Gτv + η∞), and η∞ evaluated
from viscoelastic spectra seen in Figure 6a are shown in Figure 6b. The G value clearly increases
with increasing c in proportion to c with the slope of ca 0.2 Pa L g–1, whereas the
τv seemed to be approaching the constant value of
1.0 × 10–4 s with decreasing c. Moreover, the values of η0 and η∞ slightly increase with increasing c.

Theoretical
consideration has been established for a viscoelastic
behavior of suspensions of rodlike particles dispersed into viscous
media.33,34 The theory for monodisperse particle suspensions
predicts the relationship between the viscoelastic relaxation time
and the rotational relaxation time of dispersed rods; τv = (6Dr)−1 in
an extremely dilute condition without touching between particles,
and that between the relaxation strength and concentration; G = (3/5)vkBT, where v means the number density of CNC particles
in suspensions.34 Supposing the Dr is determined using DDLS techniques, the value
of τv = 7.4 × 10–5 s can be
calculated, which is 26% smaller than the experimental τv value via the DLS viscoelastic measurements. The experimental
τv is close to the (6Dr)−1 value calculated from the dimensions of a rod
with L = 190 nm and W = 8 nm, which
is not so far from the value of Ltr and
is placed between the L values of the major and minor
components seen in Figure 2. On the other hand, the experimental value of Gc–1 reasonably agrees with the calculated value
of 0.2 Pa L g–1, as seen in Figure 6b, assuming the density of the CNC particles
to be 1.6 g cm–3 and the values of Ltr = 170 nm and Wtr = 7.6
nm obtained from transport coefficients above. Moreover, the proportional
constants of (η0 – ηw)c–1 and (η∞ –
ηw)c–1 are also
theoretically evaluated to be 1.97 × 10–5 Pa
s L g–1 ([η] = 22.3 mL g–1) and 4.93 × 10–6 Pa s L g–1, respectively. The agreement between experimental values and theoretical
ones shown with solid lines in Figure 6b seems reasonable.

We consequently might conclude
that CNC particles of the examined
CNC sample disperse well into water and behave as individually isolated
rodlike particles possessing the dimension with L ≈ 170 nm and W ≈ 7.6 nm also from
the viewpoint of viscoelastic behavior of aqueous suspensions of the
CNC sample, as clearly demonstrated in the TEM observation described
above. The reason why the CNC sample has such a high dispersibility
into water should be effective electrostatic repulsive interaction
between the CNC particles because of the presence of anionically charged
sulfate groups in water, which are introduced on the surface of CNC
particles during the hydrolysis reaction using sulfuric acid. It looks
similar to the fact that the electrostatic repulsive interaction between
sulfate groups effectively prevents from hydrogen bond (re)formation
between hydroxy groups on the surface of different CNC particles in
the sample. At last, we conclude that the commercial prototype CNC
sample examined in this study has morphological characteristics, that
is, highly extended rodlike structure with approximately monodisperse
length and width of 170 and 7.6 nm, respectively, which would be a
promising feature as industrial materials to provide anisotropic mechanical
and/or optical properties with low density of carbohydrates.

Mao et al.18 very recently reported
that the rotational and translational diffusion coefficients were
determined to be Dr = 4.0 × 103 s–1 and Dt =
4.4 × 10–12 m2 s–1, respectively, for CNC particles contained in the same sample as
examined in this study. Because the reported Dr value was miscalculated by the authors and the correct value
can be calculated to be Dr ≈ 670
s–1 from the data shown in the literature,18 their (correct) Dr and Dt are substantially smaller than
the values determined in this study and give much longer L values than the LTEM and Ltr, as seen in Figure 2a. However, the reason for the observed disagreement
between their Dr and Dt values and that determined in this study is not clear
at present. Because the TEM image of CNC particles shown in the literature18 looks quite similar to that in Figure 1 in this study, the Dr and Dt determined
in this study seem to be more reliable than their values.

Conclusions
In this study, transport properties for a CNC sample in the white
dry powder shape resulted from chemical pulp via hydrolysis procedure
by sulfuric acid, supplied by InnoTech Alberta Inc. as a commercial
prototype sample, were determined using dynamic light scattering techniques
in aqueous suspensions at room temperature of 25 °C. The obtained
average rotational, translational diffusion coefficients and viscoelastic
relaxation times for the CNC sample at dilute conditions reveal without
contradiction that CNC particles contained in the sample possess almost
a monodisperse length and width of 170 and 7.6 nm, respectively. These
structural quantities well-correspond to that evaluated TEM images,
which demonstrated a vast number of thin needle- or spindle-like shape
objects recognized as primary CNC particles, obtained from a highly
dilute aqueous suspension of the CNC sample. Then, the CNC particles
in the sample keep high dispersibility into water even after the (complete)
drying out process necessary as a producing one.

Experimental Section
Materials
A CNC sample made from the hardwood chemical
pulp sourced from Populus tremuloides Michx. was kindly supplied by InnoTech Alberta Inc. (Edmonton) in
the shape of white dry powder. Highly deionized water with the specific
resistance higher than 1.8 × 105 Ω m, which
was generated by a Direct-Q UV3 (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt), was
used as a medium fluid to prepare aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample.
Poly(styrene) spherical latex particles (PL3) possessing the mean
diameter of 300 nm with a sharp narrow distribution was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC (St. Louis) in the shape of an aqueous
suspension at the concentration of 10 vol % and was added into aqueous
CNC suspension as probe particles to measure viscoelastic behavior
using DLS techniques.

The concentration of the CNC sample in
aqueous suspension used for TEM observation was ranged from c = 0.1 to 0.01 g L–1 and chose a suspension
sample at c = 0.05 g L–1 as an
adequate one for the purpose and also the statistical analysis of
the obtained TEM images. Dilute aqueous suspensions of the CNC sample
were prepared at concentrations of c = 1.0 and 5.0
g L–1 for depolarized and usual DLS measurements
to determine Dr and Dt values. These concentrations were much lower than the
previously reported critical concentrations for usual CNC samples
prepared from chemical pulp to show liquid crystalline phases.10,11 The prepared aqueous suspensions were sonicated for longer than
1 h using a usual sonicator bath to disperse CNC particles effectively
and were filtrated through a hydrophilic membrane filter with the
pore size of 5 μm to remove coarse dust and CNC particle aggregates.
The probe PL3 particles were added to aqueous CNC suspensions at a
low concentration of 1.5 × 10–2 g L–1.

Methods
A JEM-1400 Plus transmission electron microscope
(JEOL Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was operated to observe CNC particle
specimens at the acceleration voltage of 80 kV. The prepared aqueous
suspension of the CNC sample was dropped on lacey film-coated copper
grids (SPI Supplies/Structure Probe Inc., West Chester) supported
by carbon films. For negative staining, 2% aqueous uranyl acetate
solution was dropped on the grid containing CNC particles, and the
excess solution was removed using a filter paper followed by air drying.

DLS experiments for Dr and Dt measurements were carried out using an ALV/CGS-3
compact goniometer system equipped with a 7004/UBS correlator (ALV-Laser,
Langen) and an Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm) as a light source.
Because the incident laser source was vertically polarized, the depolarized
and usual measuring conditions were obtained by inserting a horizontally
polarizing optical device or not. Then, the usual DLS condition detects
all of the scattered light from the vertically polarized incident
laser source. Auto correlation functions of scattered light intensities
were recorded at 25 °C as functions of time at several scattering
angles ranged from 30 to 150°.

DLS experiments for viscoelastic
measurements were carried out
using a DLS-7000HL DLS photometer (Otsuka Electronics Ltd., Hirakata)
equipped with an R9880U-01 photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics
K.K., Hamamatsu), an LSI correlator (LS Instruments AG, Fribourg),
and a He–Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm) as a light source. All
of the measurements were carried out at 25 °C at the fixed scattering
angle of 60°.
