Obtaining
highly efficient photoluminescence with Mn4+-activated
phosphors, which have been extensively studied in diverse
lighting devices, requires the precise control of the manganese valence
states. However, this control is difficult to achieve because manganese
ions can have various valence states ranging from divalent to heptavalent.
Additionally, the concentrations of Mn ions in each valence state,
especially the effective Mn4+ concentration, have never
been quantitatively determined in a phosphor crystal lattice. The
relationship between the effective Mn4+ concentration and
the luminescence properties of Mn4+-activated phosphors
is of current interest for improving the phosphor properties. In the
present study, the effective Mn4+ concentration in Li2TiO3:Mn4+ (LTO:Mn) phosphors prepared
by the sol–gel method with heating at various temperatures
was quantitatively analyzed by X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy.
Moreover, the effect of the existence of Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ ions on the photoluminescence efficiency was
investigated. The effective Mn4+ concentration was found
to be over 60% in all phosphor samples. The quantum efficiencies (QEs)
of all LTO:Mn phosphors strongly depend on the effective Mn4+ concentration. In particular, the LTO:Mn phosphor prepared by heating
at 800 °C (LTO:Mn@800) contained the highest effective Mn4+ concentration of 98.1% and exhibited the highest internal
QE of 31.6%. The results of this work provide new and important insights
for the development of Mn4+-activated phosphors with high
efficiency.

Introduction
A manganese (Mn) ion
takes multiple valence states from divalent
to septivalent. Since a tetravalent manganese ion, Mn4+, exhibits (deep) red emission under visible-light excitation, it
has been widely applied to many fields, including lighting, holographic
recording, and thermoluminescence dosimetry.1−3 In addition,
it has a high potential to replace Eu3+-doped phosphors
from a cost-effective point of view because Mn4+ has photoluminescence
properties similar to those of Eu3+ in inorganic phosphor
materials with high quantum efficiency (QE) and high-purity red emission
under visible-light irradiation.4 Mn4+-doped oxide phosphors have been extensively investigated
in many host materials.4−6 Although some Mn4+-activated oxide phosphors
exhibit deep red emission due to the 2E → 4A2 transition under UV-light irradiation, the emission
efficiency excited by visible-light irradiation is significantly lower
than that excited by UV-light irradiation. Therefore, Mn4+-activated oxide phosphors have not been commercialized for devices
that enable visible-light excitation. To overcome such disadvantages,
the enhancement of the emission intensity excited by visible-light
irradiation has been investigated using various techniques as follows:
Bi3+–Mn4+ energy transfer generated by
Bi3+ doping,7,8 the modification of chemical compositions,
and the control of morphology.9,10 The improvement in
the luminescence efficiency under visible-light excitation has also
been investigated by suppressing lower oxidation state manganese ions,
such as Mn2+ and Mn3+, which can act as quenching
ions for the luminescence of Mn4+, i.e., an increase in
the “effective Mn4+ concentration”. The following
two types of techniques are known for their enhancement of the effective
Mn4+ concentration: a charge compensation technique involving
the doping of heterogeneous metal ions, M2+ (M2+:Mg2+ and Zn2+) ions and Mn4+ in
aluminate hosts,11,12 and oxygen-pressure annealing
processing.13 A Mn2+ ion involuntarily
incorporates into Al3+ due to charge compensation when
Mn4+ is doped into Al3+ sites in a typical CaAl12O19 host, and Mg2+ is added simultaneously
to the Al3+ site to suppress the production of Mn2+ by charge compensation in CaAl12O19:Mn4+ phosphors.11 The emission intensity of Mg2+-codoped phosphors
has been enhanced to be approximately 1.8 times larger than that of
phosphors with no heterogeneous species, which is ascribed to an increase
in the effective Mn4+ concentration.11 In the other technique, annealing in a high-pressure oxygen
atmosphere to reoxidize the produced Mn2+ ions increases
the effective Mn4+ concentration in Ca14Zn6Al10O35:Mn4+ phosphors.13 These Mn4+-activated phosphors can
enhance the photoluminescence intensity. In these investigations,
Mn4+ in phosphors has been analyzed by only qualitative
analyses using some techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
electron spin resonance, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure
(XANES).9,11,14−16 In addition, these reports provided no direct information regarding
the relationship between the effective Mn4+ concentration
and the photoluminescence properties in a phosphor lattice. The direct
and quantitative determination of the Mn4+ ion, namely,
the effective Mn4+ concentration, in phosphor materials
is highly important for understanding the Mn4+-dependent
enhancement of luminescence efficiency.

Recently, we focused
on the Li2TiO3:Mn4+ (LTO:Mn) phosphor
as a good material to perform a quantitative
analysis of the effective Mn4+ concentration and investigate
the relationship between the effective Mn4+ concentration
and photoluminescence properties. The Li2TiO3 host is composed of a layered rock-salt structure,17 which is a sandwich of the two-dimensional layer of [(Li,Ti)O6] octahedra and Li+ ions.18 The Mn4+-doped Li2TiO3 phosphor
shows a red emission with a maximum peak at approximately 680 nm by
incorporating the Mn4+ activator into the TiO6 octahedral site.19,20 Lithium manganate(IV), Li2MnO3, which is completely substituted by Mn instead
of Ti in the Li2TiO3 host, also has the same
layered rock-salt structure.17 Therefore,
the LTO:Mn phosphor is suitable for investigating the relationship
between the effective Mn4+ concentration and the photoluminescence
properties without considering drastic changes in the main structure.
LTO:Mn phosphors have potential as red-emitting phosphors for white
light-emitting diodes and have been studied for the enhancement of
the photoluminescence intensity by doping heterogeneous ion species,
such as different alkali ions, Ge4+ and Zn2+.20 However, the mechanism underlying
the enhancement in the luminescence intensity is still unclear because
the valence state of the manganese ions in the phosphors has not been
determined. In the present study, the manganese ion valence state
in high-quality LTO:Mn phosphors prepared by the sol–gel method
was studied. In addition, we investigated the relationship between
the photoluminescence properties and the manganese ion valence state
determined by a quantitative analysis of X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) spectra using the Athena program.21

Results and Discussion
Field-emission scattering electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) images were
employed to determine the morphological information and chemical composition
of the typical LTO:Mn@800 phosphor (Figure S1a). The LTO:Mn phosphors have cubic or spherical particles, which
are grown by an increase in the heating temperature (Figure S2). The particle of the LTO:Mn phosphor has a spherical
morphology with a diameter of ∼500 nm. Generally, the spherical
morphology enhances the luminescence efficiency generated from the
improvement in the light-extraction efficiency. The signal of the
lithium element cannot be observed in the energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) because of its light atomic mass. According to the EDX spectrum
of the LTO:Mn@800 phosphor, Ti and O can be clearly observed in the
spectrum (Figure S1c). From the estimation
of the chemical composition by the ZAF method by the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDS) results, the elemental ratio of Mn/(Ti +
Mn) was 8.9 × 10–3 (0.89 mol %), indicating
that approximately 1 mol % manganese was introduced into the Li2TiO3 host for the LTO:Mn phosphors. Additionally,
it could be confirmed that Ti, O, and Mn were uniformly dispersed
in the particles of a typical LTO:Mn@800 phosphor (Figure S1d–g).

A refinement for the detailed
crystallographic data of a typical
LTO:Mn@800 phosphor was carried out using the Rietveld technique with
a conventional XRD profile (Figure 1a). In the XRD pattern, the broad pattern consisting
of reflections owing to the [√3ahex × √3ahex] superstructure,
which is caused by a Li/Ti(Mn) ordering arrangement,17 was observed in the range from 2θ = 19 to 30°.
This result suggests that oxygen deficiency is introduced to the layers
in the synthesized LTO:Mn phosphors.22 In
the layered rock-salt structures of Li2TiO3 and
Li2MnO3, the superstructure can often be observed
by calcination at low temperatures with a short heating time.22 Therefore, the refinement was conducted for
ranges except the pattern range due to the superstructure and this
technique is generally used to analyze the Rietveld method for isostructural
materials with Li2TiO3 and Li2MnO3. The refined results for the R factors and S values for all LTO:Mn phosphors prepared at different
temperatures (600–1000 °C) are summarized in Table S1 and agree with the phase determination
based on the powder XRD data. The results suggest that the crystal
structure of all phosphor samples could be successfully refined to
be similar (Figure S3). The crystal phases
of all LTO:Mn phosphors were confirmed by the XRD patterns and Raman
spectra. Figure 1b
shows the XRD patterns for LTO:Mn phosphors prepared at various temperatures.
All XRD peaks of all phosphors were characterized to be the well-known
monoclinic Li2TiO3 phase as a single phase.
Significant XRD peak shifts were not observed. Additionally, the XRD
peak intensities for the LTO:Mn@600 and @700 samples were weaker than
those for the samples calcined at higher temperatures because sufficient
crystal growth did not occur in the low-temperature treatment. All
peaks in the Raman spectra for the LTO:Mn@600–@900 samples
were attributed to the Li2TiO3 phase (Figure 1c), whereas the weak
Raman peak in the Raman spectrum for the LTO:Mn@1000 sample was observed
at approximately 820 cm–1, corresponding to the
bending motion of Ti–O–Si in the Li2TiSiO5 phase,23 in which the Si element
is a contaminant from the reaction boat.

pattern for the LTO:Mn@800 phosphor. (b) PXRD patterns and (c) Raman
spectra for LTO:Mn phosphors prepared at various temperatures.

To quantitatively determine an effective concentration
for trace
Mn4+ ions in the crystal lattice of LTO:Mn phosphors, we
measured the XANES spectra for these phosphor samples. Figure 2 shows the Mn K-edge XANES spectra in the energy range from 6520 to 6600 eV of the
LTO:Mn phosphors as well as the standard compounds composed of various
valence manganese ions with the octahedral MnO6 unit (MnCO3, Mn2O3, and Li2MnO3). The XANES spectrum of Li2MnO3 was similar
to that of the MnO2 standard sample (Figure S4). Here, Li2MnO3 was more suitable
as the standard sample for Mn4+ than MnO2, although
MnO2 is often used as the Mn4+ standard sample
because the coordination environment surrounding Mn4+ is
close to that in LTO:Mn phosphors. Therefore, fitting the XANES spectra
of LTO:Mn phosphors using Li2MnO3 could yield
better results. In standard manganese oxide compounds, the Mn K-edge XANES peaks shifted to the higher energy side with
an increase in the valence of the manganese ion: specific peaks were
observed at 6548 eV for MnCO3 (Mn2+), 6555 eV
for Mn2O3 (Mn3+), and 6557 eV for
Li2MnO2 (Mn4+), which are in good
agreement with reported XANES spectra.24,25 Because the
maximum peak in the XANES spectra for all LTO:Mn samples matches the
peak at 6557 eV observed for Li2MnO3 due to
the Mn4+ ion, most of the manganese ions doped in the phosphor
crystal lattice should exist as Mn4+. However, the shoulder
peak attributed to the Mn2+ ion was also observed at 6548
eV. Although all LTO:Mn samples contain Mn2+, the LTO:Mn@800
sample contains less Mn2+ based on the shoulder peak intensities.
Thus, it is suggested that the LTO:Mn@800 sample should have a relatively
high concentration of Mn4+. The discrete concentrations
of the manganese ions in each oxidation state doped in the phosphor
samples were estimated from spectral fitting using the Athena program21 based on the spectra of standard compounds with
various oxidation states, as shown in Table 1. Although Mn4+, Mn2+, and Mn3+ were contained in all phosphor samples, most
manganese ions were present as Mn4+. Particularly, the
LTO:Mn@800 sample contained the highest effective concentration of
Mn4+ (98.1%) among all of the samples. The effective Mn4+ concentration in the LTO:Mn@1000 sample drastically decreased
because the manganese ion incorporates as a lower valence state into
the impurity Li2TiSiO5 phase. Additionally,
the average values of the bond valence sum (BVS) for Ti sites in the
LTO:Mn phosphors are listed in Table 1. The LTO:Mn@600 sample had the lowest average BVS
value, indicating that it contained more Mn2+ and Mn3+ than the other phosphors. The average BVS values of the
Ti sites corresponded to the result of the XANES analysis. Therefore,
the values of the effective Mn4+ concentration obtained
from XANES analysis were reasonable because they matched well with
the trends of the BVS values of the Ti sites.

MnCO3, Mn2O3, and Li2MnO3.

Figure 3a shows
the diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra for the Li2TiO3 host and LTO:Mn phosphors. In the Li2TiO3 host, a strong optical absorption can be observed in the deep UV
region from 200 to 300 nm due to a charge-transfer state (CTS) between
the Ti4+ and O2– ions, while the optical
absorption edge was at 305.0 nm (4.07 eV) from the spectrum transferred
by the Kubelka–Munk function, as shown in Figure S5. All LTO:Mn phosphors exhibited the three specific
major optical absorption bands for Mn4+, such as the 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2 transitions
and R-lines, in addition to the CTS of the Li2TiO3 host. Furthermore, the Mn4+–O2– CTS band is probably located in the deep UV range
below 300 nm, with an overlap with the Ti4+–O2– CTS in the Li2TiO3 host because
the CTS between Mn4+ and O2– is usually
observed in the spectral region from 200 to 300 nm.26 Photoluminescence (PL) and its excitation (PLE) spectra
for the LTO:Mn phosphors are shown in Figure 3b. In all LTO:Mn phosphors, the PLE spectra
monitored at the deep red emission at 680 nm consisted of two typical
broad bands at 300–600 nm, which are ascribed to the 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2 spin-allowed transitions
of Mn4+ ions with peaks at approximately 321 and 470 nm,
respectively.27 These optical absorption
bands of the phosphors due to Mn4+-derived absorptions
correspond well to those from the DR spectrum. In the PL spectra of
all LTO:Mn phosphors, two peaks were observed at 680 and 695 nm, corresponding
to the 2E → 4A2 transition
of Mn4+. Dramićanin et al. reported an investigation
of the detailed luminescence properties of Li2TiO3:Mn4+.28 According to their
report, the 2E → 4A2 PL emission
is located at 688 nm and the PLE bands due to the 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2 transitions are located
at approximately 28 000 (∼350 nm) and 18 000–20 000
cm–1 (500–550 nm), respectively. The PL and
PLE positions in the LTO:Mn phosphors in this study were similar to
those reported in LTO:Mn phosphors.20,29 In particular,
the LTO:Mn@800 phosphor sample showed the highest PL and PLE intensities
of all samples. The PLE relative peak intensity from the visible-light
region to that of the UV region for LTO:Mn@900 and @1000 is weaker
than that for LTO:Mn@800 (Figure S6). The
PL intensities of the samples of LTO:Mn@900 and @1000 should decrease
due to reabsorption of PL photons, and as a result, the baselines
in the DR spectra for the LTO:Mn@900 and @1000 phosphors have a lower
intensity than that for the LTO:Mn@800 phosphors. Absorbances and
quantum efficiencies (QEs) under excitation at 477 nm for LTO:Mn phosphors
are summarized in Table 2. Although no difference was clearly observed in the absorbance for
all samples prepared at various temperatures, the internal QEs obviously
changed depending on the calcination temperature. The internal QE
of LTO:Mn@800 was the highest (31.6%) among all samples; in addition,
the variation trend in the internal QE values was close to that in
the PL intensities.

host and LTO:Mn phosphors. (b) PL and PLE
spectra of LTO:Mn phosphors (solid line).

Furthermore, the PL intensity and internal QE under visible-light
excitation were plotted against the calcination temperature, as shown
in Figure 4a. The PL
intensity and QE change in response to the effective Mn4+ concentration, and the relative PLE intensity changes from the visible-light
region to the UV region due to the 4A2 → 4T2 transition in a trend similar to that of the
PL intensity for all phosphors. We successfully demonstrated that
the PL and PLE intensities are strongly correlated to the effective
Mn4+ concentration. The room temperature decay curves of
the emission of the 2E → 4A2 transition in the LTO:Mn phosphors are shown in Figure 4b. The decay curves were well
fitted by the secondary exponential equations, as summarized in Table 2. The faster and slower
components in the decay curves can be attributed to the nonradiative
energy transfers of the Mn4+ → killer centers and
Mn4+ → Mn4+, respectively.30,31 The PL lifetime of the slower component tends to gradually decrease
until LTO:Mn@800 and drastically decrease from LTO:Mn@800. The trend
is commonly observed in the Mn4+ concentration dependence
on the PL lifetime in the conventional phosphors.32,33 However, that of the faster component tends to increase to LTO:Mn@800
and then drastically decrease. The PL decay behavior indicates that
the energy transfer from Mn4+ to the killer centers can
be significantly reduced in the LTO:Mn@800 sample, i.e., the lower-valence
manganese ions of Mn2+ or Mn3+ working as the
killer center are incorporated into the LTO:Mn@800 lattice at the
lowest concentration.

The LTO:Mn@800 phosphors prepared by the sol–gel
method
(LTO-SolGel), which have excellent photoluminescence properties, were
compared to the LTO:Mn phosphors prepared at 1000 °C by the solid-state
reaction method (LTO-SSR). The crystal structure of the LTO-SSR@1000
sample was refined using the XRD profile by a Rietveld analysis, as
shown in Figure S7. The XRD profile of
the LTO-SSR@1000 phosphor was well fitted to the Li2TiO3 phase. The DR, PL, and PLE spectra of the LTO-SolGel@800
phosphor were also compared to those of the LTO-SSR@1000 sample (Figure 5a). The LTO-SolGel
exhibits approximately 2.4 times higher PL and PLE intensities under
480 nm excitation than those of the LTO-SSR, although the PL and PLE
spectra of both samples have similar shapes. Furthermore, the internal
QE value of the LTO-SSR phosphor was 9.6%, which is 3.3 times lower
than that of the LTO-SolGel sample (Table 2). From the DR spectra of both phosphor samples,
the LTO-SolGel sample shows a higher optical absorption for the 4A2 → 4T2 transition
and lower baseline absorption than the LTO-SSR phosphor sample, indicating
that the LTO-SolGel sample has a higher absorbance for visible light
and more suppression of the reabsorption of Mn4+ emission
than the LTO-SSR phosphor sample. The differences in the optical properties
of both samples can also be explained by the effective Mn4+ concentration, as shown in Figure 5b. Additionally, the results of the effective Mn4+ concentration and BVS values of the Ti sites of LTO-SSR@1000
are shown in Table 1. The BVS values of both Ti sites of the LTO-SSR@1000 sample were
found to be around 3.70, which are relatively low than those of LTO-SolGel
samples. Additionally, the effective Mn4+ concentration
in the LTO-SSR@1000 sample was corelated to the BVS values of all
samples. The effective Mn4+ concentration in the LTO-SSR
phosphor sample was 89.4%, which is higher than that of LTO-SolGel@1000
because the impurity phase of Li2TiSiO5 was
observed in the LTO-SolGel@1000 phosphor (74.7%); in contrast, the
effective concentration was lower than that in the LTO-SolGel@800
sample (98.1%). Only a few percent difference in the effective Mn4+ concentration causes a drastic change in the PL intensity.
The PL intensity of LTO-SSR sample followed a trend of the effective
concentration and BVS values. To evaluate the preparation behavior
to form the LTO phosphors, thermogravimetric–differential
thermal analysis (TG–DTA) curves for the precursors of both
samples were recorded (Figure S8). The
TG curve of the precursor for the LTO-SSR sample began to decrease
at ∼500 °C, at which the reaction occurs, and an endothermic
peak at ∼700 °C was observed. The reaction at higher temperatures
will cause sintering of the precursor and form a nonuniform sample.
The precursor for the LTO-SolGel sample began to decompose at 100
°C, which was due to the combustion of residual organic components,
and the reaction was complete at approximately 550 °C without
sintering, similar to the SSR method. Indeed, the high dispersibility
of manganese was observed in the LTO-SolGel sample from the electron-probe
microanalysis (EPMA) maps, while manganese was segregated in the LTO-SSR
sample (Figure S9). Therefore, the uniformity
of Mn atoms in phosphors at the atomic level leads to local disproportionation
of the manganese valence states as well as a decrease in the PL intensity.

and PLE spectra (solid lines) and DR spectra (broken line)

Conclusions
Deep red-emitting Li2TiO3:Mn4+ phosphors were successfully
prepared via a sol–gel route
at various temperatures from 600 to 1000 °C. The morphology,
elemental composition, and crystal structure of the phosphors were
characterized in detail by FE-SEM, EDS, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy.
By analyzing the chemical state for valence states from +2 to +4,
even for a small amount of Mn in the lattice, we successfully used
XANES to directly analyze and estimate the concentration ratio of
discrete valence states of Mn ions. We found that the existence of
a small amount of Mn2+ or Mn3+ leads to a drastic
decrease in the quantum efficiency. This analysis technique can be
applied to other Mn4+-activated phosphors, such as oxides
and fluorides. The effective Mn4+ concentration in the
phosphors is an important key to enhancing the luminescence efficiency.
This work should provide a high impact, new concept to develop Mn4+-doped oxide phosphors.

Synthetic Procedure
The Mn4+-activated Li2TiO3 phosphors
(LTO:Mn), namely, Li2(Ti0.99Mn0.01)O3, were synthesized
via a sol–gel method using citric acid as a complexing agent.
First, 28.0 mmol citric acid anhydrate (CA) were stirred in 20 mL
of deionized water at 80 °C until completely dissolved, and then,
9.25 mmol titanium(IV) butoxide monomer, Ti[C4H9]4, was dropwise added into the CA solution. Although
a white precipitate was instantly generated by the addition of Ti[C4H9]4, the precipitate was dissolved
by stirring at 80 °C for a few hours because of the formation
of a titanium citrate complex. Then, 18.7 mmol lithium nitrate and
9.34 × 10–2 mmol manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate
were dissolved in the transparent solution containing Ti and CA at
80 °C. After stirring for 2 h for the complexation of Li and
Mn, the solution was evaporated at 120 °C until a transparent
gel formed, and then, the gel was heated at 500 °C for 6 h to
decompose the organic components. A peach-colored precursor powder
was obtained after heating and subsequently calcined in the reaction
boat (63% SiO2–37% Al2O3)
at various temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 °C for 6 h in
the atmosphere. Here, in this paper, the LTO:Mn phosphors synthesized
at several temperatures are described as LTO:Mn@600–1000. The
obtained phosphor powder was reground to a fine powder using an agate
mortar. Finally, the obtained phosphors were washed with deionized
water, filtered, and dried at 60 °C. The LTO:Mn phosphor was
also synthesized by the conventional solid-solid-state reaction (SSR)
method according to previous reports in the literature.20 A fine raw material powder of Li2CO3, TiO2, and MnCO3 was weighed
with stoichiometric amounts to create the chemical composition of
Li2(Ti0.99Mn0.01)O3 and
mixed in acetone using the agate mortar. The homogeneous mixture was
calcined at 1000 °C for 6 h in air.

Characterization and Apparatus
The morphological information
about the phosphors was obtained using field-emission scattering electron
microscopy (FE-SEM; JEOL, JSM-6500F) observations, and the elemental
maps of the Ti, Mn, and O atoms on the particle surface of the phosphor
samples were obtained by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDS) method using an FE-SEM electron beam; the measurement samples
were coated with platinum by a sputtering treatment to enhance the
electron conductivity. The crystal phases of the LTO:Mn phosphor samples
were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray diffractometer
(PANalytical, X’Pert PRO) with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54059 Å) and Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, T64000)
using a continuous-wave Ar laser at a wavelength of 514.5 nm. Additionally,
the detailed crystallographic parameters of all samples were refined
by the Rietveld technique based on XRD with Cu Kα radiation
using the RIETAN-FP program.34 The diffuse
reflectance spectra were recorded using a UV–visible spectrometer
(JASCO Corp., V-700) with an integrating sphere attachment. The photoluminescence
emission and excitation spectra of the powder phosphor samples were
measured by a spectrofluorometer (JASCO Corp., FP-6500/6600) equipped
with a 150 W Xe lamp as the excitation source at room temperature.
The internal/external quantum efficiency (QE) of the phosphor samples
was recorded by an instant multiphotometric system (Otsuka Electronics
Co. Ltd., MCPD-7000). The Mn K-edge XANES spectra of the phosphor
samples and manganese reference samples (MnCO3, Mn2O3, MnO2, and Li2MnO3), which were prepared and pelletized with a boron nitride
powder, were recorded with beamline BL15A1 in the Photon Factory (PF)
at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Japan
in fluorescence and transmittance modes. The photoluminescence decay
curves of the phosphor samples were recorded by a spectrofluorometer
(Hamamatsu Photonics, Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12) at 365 nm using a
Xe flush lamp as the excitation source. The thermal changes in the
precursor samples were investigated by thermogravimetry and differential
thermal analyses (TG–DTA; TG-2000, Bruker AXS K.K., Japan)
in a temperature range from room temperature to 1000 °C under
air conditions. The heating rate was 10 °C/min. The elemental
mapping of the particle surface was observed by an electron-probe
microanalyzer (EPMA: JEOL, JXA-8200).
