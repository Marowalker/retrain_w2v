Recently, halide
double perovskites (HDPs), such as Cs2AgBiBr6, have been reported as promising nontoxic alternatives
to lead halide perovskites. However, it remains unclear whether the
charge-transport properties of these materials are as favorable as
for lead-based perovskites. In this work, we study the mobilities
of charges in Cs2AgBiBr6 and in mixed antimony–bismuth
Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6, in which the band gap is tunable
from 2.0 to 1.6 eV. Using temperature-dependent time-resolved microwave
conductivity techniques, we find that the mobility is proportional
to T–p (with p ≈ 1.5). Importantly, this indicates that phonon
scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism determining the charge
carrier mobility in these HDPs similar to the state-of-the-art lead-based
perovskites. Finally, we show that wet chemical processing of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 powders is a successful route to prepare thin
films of these materials, which paves the way toward photovoltaic
devices based on nontoxic HDPs with tunable band gaps.

1 Introduction
Halide
double perovskites (HDPs) such as Cs2AgBiBr6 have recently emerged as a nontoxic alternative to lead-based
perovskites1−5 and were successfully applied as radiation absorbers both in sensitive
X-ray detectors and in photovoltaic devices.6−8 Still, the power
conversion efficiencies of Cs2AgBiBr6-based
solar cells are relatively low,7,8 which can be partially
understood from its poor visible light absorption because of its indirect
band gap of 2.19 eV.2 It was recently shown
that alloying Tl3+ or Sb3+, both thought to
substitute for Bi3+, can be used as a strategy to decrease
the band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6 toward values more
relevant for single-junction solar cells.9,10 However,
to date, there have been no reports presenting synthesis routes to
prepare thin films of alloyed HDPs, which is a crucial step toward
devices of these materials. Furthermore, although HDPs of various
compositions have been designed,9−13 it remains unclear whether the transport properties of these HDPs
are as favorable as for their lead-based analogues.

In this
work, we study the optoelectronic properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 and mixed antimony–bismuth HDPs
with the general formula Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6, which show an
absorption red shift with increasing x, reaching
∼1.6 eV upon replacing 40% of the Bi3+ with Sb3+ (i.e. x = 0.4).10 We use pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (PR-TRMC)
measurements to gain insight in the mobility of free charges as a
function of x and temperature.14−16 Interestingly,
we find that the charge carrier mobility decreases only marginally
on increasing x. Furthermore, we observe that, independent
of the antimony content, the mobility decreases with increasing temperature
in between 140 and 420 K. Importantly, the dependence of the mobility
on temperature (T–p, with p ≈ 1.5) indicates band-like transport
of charges in both Cs2AgBiBr6 and mixed antimony–bismuth
analogues, in which the mobility is limited by phonon scattering.
The observation that the charge-transport mechanism in these HDPs
is very similar to lead-based perovskites,17−19 highlights
their potential as nontoxic alternatives. Finally, we find that dissolving
the mixed antimony–bismuth HDP powders, synthesized using solid-state
reactions, is a successful route to spin-coat thin Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 films. The preparation of thin HDP films with mixed trivalent
metals paves the way toward photovoltaic devices based on HDPs with
tunable band gaps.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Powders of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6
Powders
of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6, with x values
ranging from 0 to 0.4, were prepared from stoichiometric
mixtures of the precursors CsBr, AgBr, BiBr3, and SbBr3, following previously reported solid-state reaction procedures.10 Here, x represents the amount
of SbBr3 added to the reaction mixture, and the formulas
are written assuming full substitution at the Bi site. The content
of Sb in each sample was estimated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Although some variation across the sample is observed, we find
that the Sb-to-Bi ratio increases monotonically with increasing Sb
content in the precursors (see Supporting Information Table S1). Figure 1a shows the absorption spectra, measured using an integrating sphere,
of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 powders with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.4, attached to quartz substrates using optically
clear adhesive. Consistent with the previous reports,10,11 these spectra show that increasing the Sb content gradually reduces
the band gap, resulting in absorption onset values close to 1.6 eV
for x = 0.4. Furthermore, all of the samples show
X-ray reflections characteristic of the double perovskite structure,
see Figure 1b, which
monotonically shifts to larger angles on increasing x (see also Supporting Information Figure
S1), supporting the replacement of Bi3+ with the smaller
Sb3+.

HDP powders with the general formula Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6. Inset
shows images of the powders with different Sb content.

To investigate the suitability of Cs2AgBiBr6 and mixed antimony–bismuth HDPs for photovoltaic
applications,
we studied the transport of free charges in powders of these materials
using the PR-TRMC technique.14,15 With the PR-TRMC technique,
free charges are homogeneously generated throughout the sample by
irradiation with a high-energy electron pulse. These primary electrons
are not injected but lose a part of their energy by ionizing the sample,
resulting in a uniform distribution of electrons and holes. The density
of charges initially generated by each high-energy electron from the
pulse can be calculated using previously reported procedures (see Experimental Methods). The total density of free
charges n0 created by the electron pulse
can be varied by changing its duration. A microwave probe is then
used to measure the change in conductivity on the generation of free
charges, which scales with the number and mobility (μ) of charge
carriers.14,16 Importantly, because the initial density
of free charges can be tuned independently of the exciton binding
energy, the PR-TRMC technique is very suitable to determine the temperature-dependent
mobility. Similar to the more widely used laser-induced TRMC,20,21 the end-of-pulse charge density n can however still
be affected by fast trapping or recombination of mobile charges within
the instrumental response time of 1 ns. Therefore, we choose a pulse
length at which losses are minimized so that n/n0 is closest to unity. Figure 2a shows the sum of electron and hole mobility
∑μ for Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.4 at temperatures ranging from 140
to 420 K. From here, we find that at room temperature, ∑μ
is at least 0.3 cm2/(V s) for Cs2AgBiBr6 (x = 0) powders, which is only about four
times lower than the mobility observed in CsPbBr3 crystals
using the same technique.15,20

Figure 2 (a) Dots: mobility ∑μ
as function of temperature for x = 0 (squares), x = 0.05 (spheres), x = 0.1 (triangles),
and x = 0.4 (diamonds),
determined using the PR-TRMC technique. On fitting these mobilities
to μ(T) ∝ T–p, added as solid lines, we obtained p-values of 1.15 (x = 0), 1.62 (x = 0.05), 1.19 (x = 0.1), and 1.34 (x = 0.4). (b) (n/n0)∑μ as
function of n0 and temperature for x = 0 (top) and x = 0.1 (bottom). (c) Trap
saturation density as a function of temperature for x = 0 (squares), x = 0.05 (spheres), x = 0.1 (triangles), and x = 0.4 (diamonds), obtained
from the maximum n/n0.

The lower mobilities observed in Cs2AgBiBr6 are consistent with the effective masses of electrons
and holes
being somewhat larger than those for its lead-based analogue (i.e.,
CsPbBr3).4,22 In addition, the scattering times
may be shorter because of enhanced scattering with phonons or defects.
On partially replacing the Bi3+ with Sb3+, slightly
reduced mobilities are observed, although at each temperature, the
absolute values stay within the same order of magnitude. Furthermore,
independent of x, the mobility decreases with rising
temperatures in between 140 and 420 K. On further analysis of the
data, we find that ∑μ scales with T–1.15 for x = 0, T–1.62 (x = 0.05), T–1.19 (x = 0.1), and T–1.34 (x = 0.4). Importantly,
these negative powers indicate that phonon scattering (i.e., μ
∝ T–1.5) is the dominant
scattering mechanism determining the charge carrier mobility in these
HDPs. These powers are within the same range as the state-of-the-art
lead-based perovskites, for which values in between −1.2 and
−1.6 have been reported.17,19,23,24 Additionally, the observation
that these negative powers are very similar for different x values suggests that the charge-transport mechanism is
not substantially disturbed on mixing bismuth with antimony. This
means that independent of the Sb3+ content in the Cs2AgBiBr6 lattice, there is band-like transport of
charges with no indication of substantial defect scattering.

As mentioned above, charge carrier losses within the instrumental
response time lead to a reduction of n/n0. Therefore, to get insight into sub-nanosecond recombination
processes, we can plot (n/n0)∑μ as a function of n0 (cm–3). This is shown in Figure 2b for Cs2AgBiBr6 (upper
panel) and Cs2AgBi0.9Sb0.1Br6 (lower panel) for temperatures ranging from 140 to 420 K.
At each temperature, (n/n0)∑μ initially rises on increasing the charge carrier
densities. We attribute this to sub-nanosecond charge carrier trapping,
leading to low yields if the trap density is higher than the charge
carrier density.25,26 Gradual saturation of these traps
then results in increased n values for higher n0, and thus an enhancement of n/n0. On further increasing n0, n/n0 decreases
again, which is typically observed if higher order recombination starts
to dominate.27,28 Therefore, the charge carrier
concentration at which (n/n0)∑μ reaches maximum values represents the regime
in which band-to-band recombination is in competition with trap-assisted
recombination and can thus be used as an indication of the trap saturation
density (cm–3).

Figure 2c displays
the densities at which the traps are saturated as a function of temperature
for the sample with (x > 0) and without (x = 0) antimony. For Cs2AgBiBr6, this
shows a clear increase from 3 × 1015 cm–3 at 140 K to more than 3 × 1016 cm–3 for T > 340 K. The room-temperature value of
1.2
× 1016 cm–3 is close to the previously
suggested upper limit of 1016 cm–3 for
a Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal.29 Interestingly, the temperature dependence of (n/n0)max suggests that the
trap density is enhanced with increasing temperatures, which could
be because the origin of the traps is related to vacancies or interstitials,
resulting from thermal displacement of ions. Alternatively, it might
be that trap states originate from thermal ionization of defects,
which also results in an increased number of available
traps at higher temperatures. For the Sb-containing HDPs, the trap
saturation densities at 140 K are 2–4 × 1015 cm–3 and thus close to the antimony-free Cs2AgBiBr6. Also here, an enhancement is observed
as the temperature rises, with (n/n0) reaching a maximum just below 1016 cm–3 at 380 K for Cs2AgBi0.9Sb0.1Br6 (see bottom panel in Figure 2b) and the other mixed antimony–bismuth
HDP powders (see also Supporting Information Figure S2). Most importantly, at and above room temperature, the
trap-saturation densities for x > 0 are about
a factor
three lower than that for x = 0, see Figure 2c. If indeed the trap states
in Cs2AgBiBr6 are related to thermal ionic motion
or defect ionization, these results suggest that this can be partially
suppressed by Sb3+ substitution.

2.2 Thin
Films of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6
The preparation of
thin films of alloyed HDPs is a crucial step toward
devices employing HDPs with tunable band gaps and also important to
further investigate their optoelectronic properties using spectroscopic
techniques.30 Although it was recently
shown that Cs2AgBiBr6 films can be spin-coated
from a solution of its precursors in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),7 there have been no reports on mixed trivalent
metal HDP films. Here, we used the products of the solid-state synthesis
to prepare thin films of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6, see also Experimental Methods. These powders were dissolved
in DMSO at 0.5 M, yielding clear solutions with yellow to orange color
(depending on x). The solutions, preheated to 75
°C, were then spin-coated on quartz substrates, followed by annealing
at 200 °C (x = 0)7 or 90 °C (for x > 0). Note that we used
lower
annealing temperatures for the Sb-containing films, as we noticed
the formation of undesired side phases (such as Cs3Sb2Br9) on using high annealing temperatures (see Supporting Information Figure S4).

Figure 3a shows the XRD patterns
of the resulting films with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and
0.4, showing all of the reflections characteristic of the HDP crystal
structure. The shift to higher angles (see also Supporting Information Figure S5) shows that the lattice parameters
are reduced on addition of Sb, consistent with Sb3+ replacing
the larger Bi3+ in these HDP thin films. In addition, we
observe that the reflections are broader for x >
0 than that for x = 0, suggesting that the crystalline
domains are larger for the latter. Note that the different relative
intensities of the reflections compared to the corresponding powders
(Figure 2c) most likely
result from preferential orientations of the crystalline domains with
respect to the substrate. XPS analysis (Supporting Information Figure S6 and Table S2) of the thin films indicates
higher Sb fractions for increasing x, which we find
to be homogeneously distributed according to the scanning electron
microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (Supporting Information Figure S7).

Figure 3 (a) XRD patterns
and (b) absorptance spectra of thin Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 films,
spin-coated from solutions of the powders
(0.5 M) in DMSO.

Figure 3b shows
the absorptance (i.e., attenuation) spectra of the thin films. Although
we expect the absorption coefficients to be identical, the absorption
onsets for the sub-micron thick films and for the corresponding millimeter-sized
powders are very different. This can be attributed to the low absorption
coefficients close to the (indirect) band gap of these materials,
which makes the onset of the absorptance very sensitive for the sample
thickness (see Supporting Information Figure
S8 for the absorption coefficients of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 for x = 0 and x = 0.4).1,10 However,
consistent with the Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 powders, the
absorption onset of the films is red-shifted on increasing x, indicating that alloying Bi3+ and Sb3+ is an effective strategy to manipulate the band gap in thin HDP
films. Altogether, the above results indicate that the Sb substitution
in antimony–bismuth alloyed thin films increases when using
higher values of x, although we note that the absolute
stoichiometry in the films might deviate from the powders, as indicated
by nonmonotonic shifts in the XRD patterns (see Supporting Information Figure S5).

To investigate to
what extent the PR-TRMC results of the antimony–bismuth
alloyed HDP powders (Figure 2) are representative for light-generated charges in the thin
Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 films, we recorded the photoconductance
using laser-induced TRMC measurements.20,21Figure 4 shows the photoconductance
as a function of time for the Cs2AgBiBr6 (Figure 4a) and Cs2AgBi0.6Sb0.4Br6 (Figure 4b) films, using an excitation
energy of 2.8 eV. Here, the maximum signal height represents the yield-mobility
product φ∑μ, in which the yield φ represents
the ratio between free charges and absorbed photons.21 For Cs2AgBiBr6 (Figure 4a), consistent with the PR-TRMC
measurements, we initially observe an enhancement of the maximum signal
height (i.e., φ∑μ), followed by a decrease on further
increasing the excitation density in Cs2AgBiBr6 (Figure 4a). Interestingly,
the maximum φ∑μ is found at a charge density 1
× 1016 cm–3, meaning that the density
at which the traps are saturated in these thin films is nearly identical
to that of the corresponding powders (i.e., 1.2 × 1016 cm–3 at room temperature, recall Figure 2c).

Figure 4 Photoconductance as a
function of time after excitation at 2.8
eV for Cs2AgBiBr6 (a) and Cs2AgBi0.6Sb0.4Br6 (b).

We can further conclude from the maximum φ∑μ
that the sum of the electron and hole mobilities amounts to at least
0.8 cm2/(V s) for the nonalloyed HDP (Figure 4a, x = 0),
similar to previously reported values for a Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film.29 This relatively low
mobility value compared to lead-based perovskites is in agreement
with the larger effective masses of both electrons and holes.4 The photoconductance signals decay at time scales
on the order of a microsecond, which suggests that the microsecond
lifetime recently observed using transient absorption spectroscopy
on similar samples originates at least partially from mobile charges.30 We note that this observation is in contrast
with our previous TRMC results, which showed that all mobile charges
recombined within several nanoseconds after exciting a Cs2AgBiBr6 film synthesized under ambient conditions.29 We suspect that the longer recombination lifetimes
in the films of the current work are due to the fact that all of these
samples were synthesized under inert conditions and not exposed to
air at any time before or during the measurements. The microsecond
lifetimes in Cs2AgBiBr6 films synthesized under
inert conditions (Figure 4a) suggest that at least one of the charges remains free,
and that the decay represents the recombination between a free charge
and its trapped counter-charge. On the basis of the mobility and half
lifetime, we estimate that the diffusion length of the free charge
carrier in Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film amounts to 0.6
μm (see Supporting Information Table
S3). Although this is relatively short compared to fully optimized
state-of-the-art lead-based perovskites,15,27 this value suggests that Cs2AgBiBr6 is a potential
nontoxic alternatives to lead-based perovskites.

For the Cs2AgBi0.6Sb0.4Br6 (Figure 4b)
thin film, the φ∑μ decreases on increasing the
charge density from 6 × 1016 to 6 × 1018 cm–3, indicating that higher order recombination
processes dominate in this regime.28 Additionally,
the maximum φ∑μ is 2 orders of magnitude smaller
than for the antimony-free HDP film (Figure 4a). On measuring the corresponding powders
with laser-induced TRMC, we also obtained lower photoconductance signals
for the Sb-containing HDPs (Supporting Information Figure S9), although here the difference
in φ∑μ is 1 order of magnitude. This can at least
partially be explained considering that the charge carrier lifetimes
for Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 with x =
0.4 as observed by PR-TRMC traces, shown in Figure S3, are very short: less than 10 ns. Because the light-induced
TRMC measurements make use of a cavity with a response time close
to 18 ns, we can thus expect a severe reduction in φ∑μ.
For thin films, however, the lower φ∑μ on Sb substitution
(Figure 4b) might also
be because of a decreased ∑μ resulting from its smaller
crystalline domain sizes.31 In addition,
the trap density might be higher in thin films, for instance, because
of oxidation of a small fraction of Sb3+, which we are
currently investigating. However, in view of the well-preserved charge-transport
properties for the Sb-substituted Cs2AgBiBr6 powders (Figure 2), it seems likely that further optimizing the synthesis procedure
and annealing conditions will improve the sample quality and hence
increase both mobilities and lifetimes in thin films of Sb-containing
HDPs. Finally, we want to highlight that the introduction of Sb results
in a band gap narrowing instead of the formation of intra band gap
defect states. On excitation of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 (x = 0.4) powder at 1.7 eV, which is below the onset of Cs2AgBiBr6, the maximum TRMC signal heights and thus
φ∑μ are similar to those obtained at 2.8 eV, as
shown in Figure S9. Similar results are
obtained for the films.

3 Conclusions
To summarize,
we have investigated the optoelectronic properties
of the double-perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 and mixed
antimony-bismuth HDPs with the general formula Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6, in which the band gap can be tuned from 2.0 to 1.6 eV by
increasing the antimony content. With PR-TRMC measurements on Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 powders, we observe that for all x values, the charge carrier mobility increases on decreasing the
temperature. The power law dependence of the mobilities on temperature
show that phonon scattering (i.e., μ ∝ T–1.5) is the dominant scattering mechanism determining
the charge-carrier mobility in these HDPs. Importantly, these results
show that for both Cs2AgBiBr6 and mixed trivalent
metal Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6, the charge-transport mechanism
is similar to the state-of-the-art lead-based perovskites. The combination
of band-like transport and band gap tunability in Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 highlights the potential of these materials as nontoxic alternatives
to lead-based perovskites. Finally, we demonstrate the preparation
of thin films of Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6, showing that
the incorporation of Sb can red shift the absorption onset up to a
few 100 meV in thin Cs2AgBiBr6 films. Altogether,
these results represent a crucial step toward lead-free perovskite
devices implementing antimony–bismuth-alloyed HDPs.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 Powders
CsBr (1 mmol), 0.5 mmol AgBr, (1 – x)0.5
mmol BiBr3, and 0.5x mmol SbBr3 were ground until fine powders were obtained. The mixtures were
sealed in glass tubes under vacuum and heated in a box furnace to
320 °C (heating rate of 3 °C/min) and kept at this temperature
for 3 h.10 After cooling down to room temperature
(cooling rate of 3 °C/min), the closed tubes containing the products
were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. For this work, x was varied between 0 and 0.4; attempts to prepare higher
concentrations of x failed.

4.2 Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 Thin Films
Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 (0.5
mmol) was dissolved in
1 mL of DMSO at 75 °C under magnetic stirring in a nitrogen-filled
glovebox.7 Quartz substrates were cleaned
with isopropanol and treated with an ozone plasma for 30 min. The
Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6/DMSO solutions were filtered and kept
at 75 °C. Then, 100 μL of the filtered solution was spin-coated
on a quartz substrate using a two-step procedure starting at 500 rpm
for 30 s (ramping speed of 100 rpm/s), followed by 60 s at 5000 rpm
(ramping speed of 5000 rpm/s). The Cs2AgBiBr6 (x = 0) films were annealed at 200 °C for
3 min, and the Sb-containing films were annealed at 90 °C for
3 min.

4.3 X-ray Diffraction
XRD patterns were
obtained with a Bruker D8 diffractometer in a Bragg–Brentano
configuration, using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation.

4.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS measurements
were performed with a Thermo Scientific K-alpha
instrument, equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source and a flood
gun to avoid charging of the sample. For the high-resolution scans
of C 1s, O 1s, Ag 3d, Bi 4f, Br 3d, Sb 3d, and Cs 3d signals, the
following parameters were used: spot size of 400 μm, pass energy
of 50 eV, energy step size of 0.1 eV, dwell time of 50 ms, and 10
scans. XPS spectra were corrected using the atmospheric carbon C peak
position (284.8 eV). Elemental quantification was performed using
the Avantage software. High-resolution scans of each element were
fit with a mixture of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions; the area
under each peak was used to determine the concentration of each element.

4.5 Optical Characterization
Absorption
and transmission spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050
spectrophotometer equipped with an integrated sphere. The thin Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 films were placed in front of the sphere to
measure the fraction of the transmitted light (FT) and under an angle of 10° inside the sphere to detect
the total fraction of reflected and transmitted photons (FR+T). From here, we calculated the fraction of absorbed
light (absorptance; FA)  

The fraction of reflected light (FR)
was determined from  

The absorption coefficient α is often calculated from
the
transmission spectrum using  where IL/I0 equals FT for
a sample of thickness L with a negligible reflection.
However, since thin perovskite films are highly reflective, α
was obtained from  

The Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 powders
were attached to quartz
substrates using optically clear adhesive tape (Thorlabs), and the
fraction of absorbed light was determined from the experimental FR+T, as described above.

4.6 PR-TRMC
Measurements
About 30 mg
of each Cs2AgBi1–xSbxBr6 powder was put in a sample
holder and covered with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), drop-casted
from a 10 mg/mL PMMA/chlorobenzene solution, to protect from moisture
and air. PR-TRMC measurements involve the generation of charge carriers
through irradiation by a short pulse of high-energy electrons (3 MeV)
and the monitoring of the changes in conductivity because of mobile
charge carriers using high-frequency microwaves (28–38 GHz).14,16 The change in conductivity is proportional to the absorbed microwave
power via a sensitivity factor A  

The experimental frequency dependence
of ΔP/P can be fitted with
an analytical expression to determine the dielectric constant, ε,
and change in conductivity, Δσ.14

The mobility is then calculated by  where n0 is the
initial concentration of charge carriers at the end of the pulse and
μ is the sum of the mobilities for electrons and holes. n0 is a function of the mass of material (m), volume of the sample holder (Vsh), irradiation energy deposited in the sample (D), and the radiation-ionization energy required for the generation
of an electron–hole pair (Ep)  D is proportional
to the
electron density of the material, and perovskites has been determined
to be ∼1 J/kg/nC.15 The latter is
derived from previous radiation dosimetry experiments. Ep has been determined according to Klein’s theoretical
model32 and Alig’s equation33 for semiconductor materials, which relates it
to the band gap of the material, phonon losses, and the residual kinetic
energy  

In the PR-TRMC
setup, the cell is contained in a cryostat in which
the temperature can be varied between 123 and 473 K. The temperature
was maintained for ∼15 min before doing the actual measurement
to assure the equilibrium of the system. The overall time response
of the setup is limited by the rise time of the detector diode and
the length of the excitation pulse (∼1 ns).

4.7 Laser-Induced TRMC Measurements
The
thin films on quartz substrates were placed in an airtight microwave
cell inside a N2-filled glovebox. The TRMC technique was
used to measure the change in microwave (8.5 GHz) power after pulsed
excitation (repetition rate 10 Hz) of the samples at various excitation
wavelengths. Neutral density filters were used to vary the intensity
of the incident light. The illuminated sample area is ∼2.5
cm2. The time-resolved change in conductance ΔG(t) was obtained from the photoexcitation-induced
change in microwave power ΔP(t), which are related by a sensitivity factor K(21)  

The rise of ΔG is limited by the width
of the laser pulse (3.5 ns full width at
half maximum) and the response time of our microwave system (18 ns).
The slow repetition rate of the laser of 10 Hz ensures full relaxation
of all photoinduced charges to the ground state before the next laser
pulse hits the sample. Before and during the photoconductance measurements,
the samples were not exposed to moisture and air to prevent degradation.
