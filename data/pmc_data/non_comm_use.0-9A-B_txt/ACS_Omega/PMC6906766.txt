Synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures through combustion
routes
is a promising technique owing to its simplicity, rapidity, scalability,
and cost-effectiveness. Herein, a sunlight-driven combustion approach
is developed to synthesize pristine metal oxides and their heterostructures.
Sunlight, a sustainable energy source, is used not only to initiate
the combustion reaction but also to create oxygen vacancies on the
metal oxide surface. ZnO nanostructures are successfully synthesized
using this novel approach, and the products exhibit higher photocatalytic
activity in the decomposition of methyl orange (MO) than ZnO nanostructures
synthesized by the conventional methods. The higher photocatalytic
activity is due to the narrower band gap, higher porosity, smaller
and more uniform particle size, surface oxygen vacancies, as well
as the enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency induced by the sunlight.
Porous Fe3O4 nanostructures are also prepared
using this environmentally benign method. Surprisingly, few-layer
Bi2O3 nanosheets are successfully obtained using
the sunlight-driven combustion approach. Moreover, the approach developed
here is used to synthesize Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure
exhibiting a structure of few-layer Bi2O3 nanosheets
decorated with ZnO nanoparticles. Bi2O3 nanosheets
and Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructures synthesized by
sunlight-driven combustion route exhibit higher photocatalytic activity
than their counterparts synthesized by the conventional solution combustion
method. This work illuminates a potential cost-effective method to
synthesize defective metal oxide nanostructures at scale.

1 Introduction
Nanostructured metal oxide
semiconductors have impressive momentum
in photocatalytic water treatment applications. However, pristine
metal oxide photocatalysts suffer from some serious drawbacks, which
negatively affect their photocatalytic performance, including short
lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes which are essential
for the photocatalytic process and/or wide band gap, which negatively
impacts the visible light response.1,2 Different approaches
have been introduced to overcome these drawbacks, including doping,
co-doping, and construction of metal-oxide-based heterostructures.3−7

Surface defect engineering approach attracts recent research
attention
because it provides a platform to overcome the above-mentioned issues
without adding any external dopants.8−10 In this regard, surface
oxygen vacancies (VOs) increase the valence band maximum
(VBM) or decrease the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the defective
metal oxides, leading to narrowed band gap and enhanced light absorption
of longer wavelength. VOs also work as temporary traps
for the photogenerated electrons, suppressing the electron–hole
recombination. Moreover, VOs increase the adsorption ability
of the defective metal oxides for the O2 and CO2 molecules.11−15 Recent reports on this subject also reveal that the VOs are able to dissociate excitons into free electrons and holes leading
to higher photocatalytic performance.16 All of these remarkable characteristics of VOs substantiate
its effect in regulating the photocatalytic activity of metal oxides.

Superior photocatalytic activity for a metal oxide is also attained
by reducing its size to the nano range or by creating pores on its
surface.17−20 Both the size reduction and pore formation are often achieved by
chemical or physical methods.19,21−23 However, most of these methods are expensive and time-/energy-consuming.
Additionally, generation of VOs is commonly achieved by
post-treatment of the synthesized metal oxide, which is further time-
and energy-consuming.24

Two-dimensional
(2D) nanomaterials beyond graphene attracted widespread
research attention due to their exceptional chemical and physical
properties.25 Two-dimensional metal oxide
nanosheets are excellent candidates for photocatalytic applications
due to their unique geometry with high specific surface area, which
provides a large number of photocatalytic reaction sites and enables
rapid charge photogeneration and high charge separation and transport
efficiency.26 In this aspect, 2D Bi2O3 nanosheets (pristine, doped, and heterostructures)
have been synthesized using different routes and used for photocatalytic
applications.27−32 However, unscalable and/or unsustainable synthesis methods have
been used to synthesize such 2D materials.

Solution combustion
synthesis is a rapid and facile method to synthesize
metal oxide nanostructures. In this process, an exothermic reaction
takes place between a fuel (e.g., urea and glycine) and an oxidizer
(normally metal nitrate), releasing a large amount of gases. Along
with its simplicity and rapidity, higher product yield makes the method
of solution combustion an ideal synthesis route, especially for industrial
applications. In addition, the large volume of gases associated with
this method develop a porous structure for the synthesized product.33−38

However, solution combustion is not completely reliable as
it requires
heat energy to initiate the exothermic combustion reaction. Also,
applying electrical heating does not produce homogeneous preheating,
which negatively affects both the particle size and pore size distribution.33,39,40 Moreover, no such solution combustion
synthesis routes are reported in the literature to directly produce
VOs in metal oxides.

Herein, a solar-driven combustion
synthesis to prepare metal oxides
is introduced for the first time. A commercial convex lens is used
to concentrate the normal sunlight irradiation (see Supporting Information Video 1). Sunlight irradiation initiates the
exothermic reaction and creates oxygen vacancies on the metal oxide
surface. Direct exposure to sunlight irradiation achieves uniform
heating. It is worthy to note that the synthesis takes place at any
time on a sunny day irrespective of the sunlight intensity. Moreover,
the formation of nanoparticles immediately starts upon exposing the
precursor to the sunlight and higher yields are obtained in short
time (ca. 5 s). The process developed could be of high interest for
industrial applications due to its simplicity, rapidity, sustainability,
cost-effectiveness, and large-scale production. ZnO, Fe3O4, and Bi2O3 are selected as model
metal oxides for the synthesis using the introduced method. The selection
was based on their wider environmental photocatalytic applications.41−45

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate
(Alfa Aesar, 99%), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%),
ferric nitrate nonahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%), glycine (Sigma-Aldrich,
99%), sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%), 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide
(Sigma-Aldrich, ≥97%, DMPO), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
(Sigma-Aldrich, 98%, TEMP), and methyl orange (Loba Chemie) were used
as received. The water used for synthesis and other experiments was
deionized (DI).

2.2 Synthesis
2.2.1 Synthesis of ZnO
To synthesize
ZnO nanoparticles, 0.297 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (oxidizer)
and 0.065 g of sucrose (fuel) were mixed and ground for 10 min to
obtain a homogeneous mixture. The mixture was exposed to concentrated
sunlight. The sunlight intensity at the surface of the mixture was
measured to be ∼1256 W m–2. The reaction
started immediately producing very light nanopowder. The synthesis
successfully took place in the morning, noon, and afternoon, indicating
that a normal sunny day is enough to carry out the synthesis, irrespective
of the light intensity. For comparison, ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized
from the same precursor using the conventional solution combustion
(CSC) synthesis on a hot plate. The corresponding sample was marked
as ZnO-CSC.

ZnO nanoparticles were also synthesized using the
hydrothermal method as follows. About 2.97 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 100 mL of 0.5 M NaOH.
The solution was stirred for 40 min at room temperature and then transferred
to a Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried
out at 120 °C for 8 h. Afterward, the autoclave was allowed to
cool to room temperature. The product obtained was then washed three
times with DI water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h.

2.2.2 Synthesis of Fe3O4
To validate the repeatability of the introduced synthesis
method, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were also prepared
following the same method. About 4.04 g of ferric nitrate nonahydrate
and 0.95 g of glycine were ground, and the mixture was exposed to
concentrated sunlight irradiation (Video 1). The sunlight intensity at the surface of the mixture was measured
to be ∼1252 W m–2.

2.2.3 Synthesis of Few-Layer Bi2O3 Nanosheets
To synthesize few-layer Bi2O3, about 4.85 g of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate was mixed
with 1.14 g of sucrose. The solid mixture was ground for 10 min to
obtain a homogeneous mixture. The mixture was exposed to concentrated
sunlight irradiation (Scheme 1). The sunlight intensity at the surface of the mixture was
measured to be ∼1264 W m–2.

2.2.4 Synthesis of Bi2O3/ZnO Heterostructure
To assure its applicability to synthesize
metal oxide heterostructures, SDC was used to synthesize Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure. The precursors, bismuth nitrate
pentahydrate and zinc nitrate hexahydrate, act as oxidizers, and sucrose
as fuel. The Bi-to-Zn ratio was 1:0.7.

2.3 Characterizations
The as-prepared
samples were analyzed using a Rigaku Smart Lab II (Cu Kα radiation,
λ = 1.5414 Å) X-ray diffractometer to study the crystal
structure, a Hitachi (S-3400N) scanning electron microscope, and a
Jeol/JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope to investigate the
morphology and structure; an ESCALAB 250Xi Thermo Scientific X-ray
photoelectron spectroscope was used to analyze the surface electronic
states and surface defects; and a Thermo Scientific Evolution 201
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer was used to record
the absorption spectra.

2.4 Photocatalysis Test
For the photodegradation
test, the mixture solution of methyl orange (MO, 10 mg L–1) or rhodamine B (RhB, 10 mg L–1) and the photocatalyst
(0.5 g L–1) was stirred for 30 min in the dark to
ensure the adsorption/desorption equilibrium before sunlight irradiation.
The sunlight intensity at the surface of the suspension was measured
to be ∼335 W m–2. The photodegradation of
MO or RhB was evaluated by monitoring the change in absorbance of
mixture solution with a Beckman Coulter DU 730 UV–vis spectrophotometer.

2.5 Mott–Schottky Measurements
To prepare the working electrodes, 5 mg of a photocatalyst was ultrasonically
dispersed in 2 mL of isopropanol alcohol and 40 μm Nafion solution.
The suspension was spin-coated on FTO glass substrates (1 × 2
cm2). The coated substrates were dried at ambient temperature
in air followed by calcination at 400 °C for 30 min. A 608E CH
instrument was used here to carry out the measurements. A platinum
wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter and reference electrodes,
respectively. Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 M)
was used as electrolyte. The recorded potential values were converted
to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale. Measurements were recorded
at a frequency of 1000 Hz, amplitude of 10 mV, and pH 7.

2.6 Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)-Trapping Tests
About 4 g L–1 of the sample was suspended in
50 μL of DI water followed by addition of 500 μL of the
spin-trapping agent. The mixture was irradiated for 2 min and analyzed
at the X-band frequency (9.4 GHz) at ambient temperature using a Bruker
spectrometer (EMX plus model). The spin-trapping agents were an aqueous
solution of TEMP (10 mM) and a methanol solution of DMPO (20 mM) for 1O2, and •O2, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterizations of ZnO
The sunlight-driven
combustion synthesis route is schematically represented in Scheme 1. The convergence
of solar radiation to the metal nitrate–glycine mixture and
the formation of a porous nanostructure are clear from the scheme. Figures 1 and S1 show the characteristic features of ZnO prepared
by the sunlight-driven combustion (ZnO SDC), conventional solution
combustion (ZnO CSC), and hydrothermal (ZnO Hy) routes. The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figures 1a and S1a confirm the formation
of pure hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO in all three samples (JCPDS
36-1451).46 The ZnO SDC shows lower crystallinity
with smaller crystallite size than ZnO CSC while ZnO Hy exhibits the
highest crystallinity and the largest crystallite size. The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images show the 3D spongelike structure
of both ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC samples (see Figure 1b) and the irregular-shaped nanoparticles
of ZnO Hy (see Figure S1b). Obviously,
the ZnO SDC exhibits a much higher and uniform distribution of pores
on its surface compared to ZnO CSC.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra, (e) O 1s XPS
images, and (f) Zn 2p XPS images of ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area and
pore size distribution of the ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC samples were investigated.
Both samples exhibit a typical type IV isotherm featuring a pronounced
H3-type hysteresis loop demonstrating the existence of mesoporous
structure (Figure S2a,b).47 The BET surface area was found to be 31.46 and 32.14 m2 g–1 for ZnO CSC and ZnO SDC, respectively.
The Barrett–Joyner–Halender (BJH) pore size distribution
graph (inset of Figure S2a) reveals that
the ZnO CSC sample has a broad pore size distribution ranging from
5 to 48 nm. The average pore diameter is measured to be 18.3 nm. For
the sample ZnO SDC, the BJH pore size distribution was quite narrow
(inset of Figure S2b) and the average pore
diameter was measured to be 14.8 nm. These results are in good agreement
with the SEM observations. It should be mentioned that the sharp peaks
at about 3.6 nm in the pore size distribution curves for both samples
are artifacts of the BJH method due to the tensile strength effect.48,49

ZnO SDC particles are more uniform in size and smaller than
the
ZnO CSC, as evident from the TEM image (see Figure 1c). These results can be attributed to the
uniform heating induced by the direct exposure of sunlight radiation.

Both ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC samples were subjected to XPS analysis
to confirm their purity as well as to investigate the presence of
surface defects on their structure. Figure 1d displays the survey spectra of ZnO SDC
and ZnO CSC. Only Zn, O, and a negligible amount of C are seen in
the XPS survey spectra. The C peak is usually associated with the
XPS sample holder. Figure 1e shows a comparison between the high-resolution O 1s XPS
spectra for ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC and their fits. Each O 1s peak is
fitted into two peaks: OI (530.18 and 530.13) is attributed
to lattice oxygen and OII (531.56 and 531.53 eV) is attributed
to VOs. Apparently, the OII/OI intensity
ratio for ZnO SDC is higher than that of ZnO CSC, indicating the presence
of a higher concentration of VOs in ZnO SDC.50 Zn 2p XPS spectra of both samples show doublet
peaks related to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 (see Figure 1f) configurations.
Zn 2p of ZnO SDC shows a downward shift compared to that of ZnO CSC,
further confirming the presence of a considerable concentration of
VOs in ZnO SDC. More clearly, the creation of VOs leads to an increase in the electron cloud density, resulting in
the downward binding energy shift of Zn 2p peak.51,52

How does sunlight create VOs? It is widely accepted
that at atmospheric temperature and pressure, UV–vis photons
are able to produce VOs on the surface of metal oxide in
the first step of the photothermochemical cycle.53−55 The same mechanism
is applicable here and thus photons of solar radiation produce VOs on the surface of metal oxide. The following reaction happens
on the metal oxide (MxOy) surface when it is exposed to sunlight photons. 1  Thus, under sunlight irradiation, MxOy is reduced to
MxOy–z.

3.2 Photocatalytic Performance and Mechanistic
Study
To further demonstrate the advantages of the method
developed, the photocatalytic efficacy of ZnO SDC is compared to that
of ZnO CSC, ZnO Hy and the standard photocatalyst TiO2-P25. Figure 2a depicts the adsorption
(in the dark) and photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO)
over ZnO SDC, ZnO CSC, ZnO Hy and TiO2-P25 under natural
sunlight irradiation as a function of irradiation time, and Figure 2b shows the photodegradation
kinetics. A negligible decrease in the MO concentration is observed
during the first 20 min of stirring in the dark because of the dye
adsorption on the photocatalysts surfaces. On the other hand, in the
absence of any catalyst, only 8% degradation of MO occurred under
sunlight, which can be attributed to photolysis of MO molecules. It
can also be seen that 89, 81, 71, and 45% of MO degraded over ZnO
SDC, TiO2-P25, ZnO-CSC, and ZnO Hy, respectively, after
60 min of sunlight irradiation (Figure 2a). In fact, from Figure 2b, one can observe that the photodegradation
rate constant for ZnO SDC (0.038 min–1) is ∼4.2
times that for ZnO Hy (0.009 min–1), ∼1.9
times that for ZnO CSC (0.02 min–1), and ∼1.3
times that for TiO2-P25 (0.029 min–1).
Hence, ZnO SDC exhibits the highest photocatalytic performance.

the presence of DMPO in methanol, and (h) schematic diagram of energy
band structure and free radicals production during the photocatalysis
process for ZnO CSC and ZnO SDC.

The durable photostability of the photocatalyst
is the key factor
for its commercialization. The photostability was examined by recycling
ZnO SDC for four sequential cycles, and the results are displayed
in Figure S3a. A negligible decrease in
MO degradation was observed after four consecutive cycles, confirming
the photostability of ZnO SDC. To ensure the structural stability
of ZnO SDC, XRD was reexamined before and after the recycling experiments.
As shown in Figure S3b, the XRD pattern
of ZnO SDC remains almost the same. Thus, ZnO SDC is photostable under
long sunlight irradiation. This antiphotocorrosion property of ZnO
SDC might be attributed to the presence of a considerable concentration
of oxygen vacancies.13,15

To understand the mechanism
behind the enhanced photocatalytic
activity of ZnO SDC, the optical absorption, band gap, CBM potential,
and VBM potential measurements were carried out using diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) analysis. Compared to ZnO CSC, the
light absorption of ZnO SDC is broadened to the visible light region
(Figure 2c). The band
gaps (Eg) calculated from Tauc plot are
3.07 and 3.19 eV for ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC, respectively (Figure 2d).

CBM and VBM are calculated
according to the following equations56 2   3  where χ is the ZnO electronegativity
(5.79 eV) and EH denotes the energy of
free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV).57 CBM and VBM are found to be, respectively, ca. −0.31
and 2.89 eV for ZnO CSC and ca. −0.25 and 2.83 eV for ZnO SDC.

VBM and CBM are further experimentally estimated using the Mott–Schottky
and valence band XPS (VB-XPS) analyses. VP-XPS measurements show that
VBM potential is 2.67 and 2.83 V for ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC, respectively
(see Figure 2e). Also,
the Mott–Schottky plots displayed in Figure 2f indicate that both ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC
are n-type semiconductors as they have positive slopes. For n-type
semiconductors, the Mott–Schottky flat-band potential is approximately
equal to that of CBM. Therefore, the CBM potential for both ZnO SDC
and ZnO CSC is equal to −0.36 V.58

To identify the different photocatalytic reactive oxygen species
(ROS) products, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement was employed.
Here, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) was used as the trapping
reagent to verify the singlet oxygen (1O2) generation.
As displayed in Figure 2g, the typical 1:1:1 triplet signal with a g-value
of 2.0056 for both samples ZnO CSC and ZnO SDC agrees well with those
of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) verifying
the 1O2 generation by both samples. The stronger
ESR signal for ZnO CSC confirms its higher 1O2 generation.16,59 On the other hand, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline
N-oxide (DMPO) was employed as the trapping agent for •O2 detection in methanol. The sextet ESR signal for both
samples ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC shown in Figure 2g verifies the DMPO–OOH formation,
which verifies the •O2 generation by
both samples. The stronger ESR signal for the sample ZnO SDC indicates
its higher •O2 production.16 Finally, the higher •O2 production and lower 1O2 generation
exhibited by ZnO SDC indicate its higher exciton dissociation efficiency,
which leads to higher concentration of free electrons and holes and
thereby higher photocatalytic performance.

To determine the
role of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and holes (h+) in the MO photodegradation, potassium
iodide (KI) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) were added
into photocatalyst/dye suspension as scavengers to trap h+ and •OH, respectively, followed by the photocatalytic
assessments.

It can be seen from Figure S4 that the
addition of TBA (•OH scavenger) greatly decreased
the photocatalytic performance of ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC, indicating
that •OH is the main active species in the degradation
reaction for both samples. In contrast, the MO degradation rate increased
in the presence of KI (h+ scavenger); about 97 and 71%
of MO were degraded by ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC, respectively, just in
40 min. This finding indicates that the h+ consumption
in the KI solution suppressed the electron–hole recombination
rate. Thus, the MO degradation was enhanced due to the increase in
the photogenerated electron concentration.60

Based on the above results, the band structure diagrams of
ZnO
SDC and ZnO CSC are presented in Figure 2h. The standard redox potential of •OH/OH– is +1.99 V vs NHE, and the standard redox
potential of O2/•O2 is −0.046
V vs NHE.61,62 One can see that the CBM and VBM potentials
for both ZnO SDC and ZnO CSC are enough to produce superoxide (•O2) and hydroxyl (•OH)
free radicals. In addition, the VBM for ZnO SDC is higher than that
for ZnO CSC. This is attributed to the overlapping of VOs state with VB leading to its upward shift in ZnO SDC. Generally,
the narrower band gap is associated with higher visible light absorption
and thereby higher solar photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the presence
of a considerable concentration of VOs enhances the photocatalytic
activity by lowering the electron–hole recombination rate,
enhancing the exciton dissociation (as confirmed by ESR), and increasing
the O2 adsorption at the defect sites.63,64 Besides, the more uniform particle and pore size distribution increase
the contact between the nanoparticles and the organic pollutant (MO),
leading to the higher photocatalytic activity.

3.3 Repeatability of the Developed Method
Solar-driven combustion synthesis is also carried out to test the
repeatability and reliability of the method by preparing Fe3O4. A recorded video demonstrating the simplicity of the
method and its potential in synthesizing Fe3O4 is included as Supporting Information Video 1.

The XRD pattern for sunlight-driven combustion-synthesized
Fe3O4 is shown in Figure S5. The peaks at 30.49, 35.78, 36.28, 43.25, 53.95, 57.27,
63.07, and 74.41° are related to the (220), (311), (222), (400),
(422), (511), (440), and (533) planes of cubic spinel structure of
Fe3O4 (ICDD no. 72-8151).65 The XRD analysis confirms the production of Fe3O4 by sunlight-driven combustion method. The weak peaks
at 37.22, and 50.19° are, respectively, related to the (110)
and (024) planes of α-Fe3O4 (ICDD no.
85-0987),65 indicating the presence of
a small of amount of α-Fe2O3. Figure S6a,b displays the morphology of Fe3O4 SDC. The porous structure is the signature of
released gases during the combustion. The photograph in Figure S6c shows a spongy dark red powder, indicating
the presence of a small amount of α-Fe2O3.66 This supports the XRD analysis. The
consistency in the nanostructure formation for both ZnO and Fe3O4 confirms the reproducibility of the sunlight-assisted
combustion method.

3.4 Synthesis of Few-Layer Bi2O3 Nanosheets
Surprisingly, we succeeded to synthesize
few-layered Bi2O3 nanosheets using sunlight-driven
combustion approach from bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (oxidizer) and
sucrose (fuel). The XRD pattern of synthesized Bi2O3 is presented in Figure 3a, in which the peaks at 21.66, 25.90, 27.00, 27.49,
33.43, 35.2, 37.02, 46.44, 52.59, and 54.93° are, respectively,
related to the (020), (002), (111), (120), (200), (−212), (121),
(041), (−321), (−241) lattice planes of monoclinic α-Bi2O3 (JCPDS no. 71-2274).41Figure 3b shows the
XPS survey spectrum of Bi2O3. All of the peaks
are related to Bi and O elements except the one at 284.6 eV related
to C 1s from the XPS sample holder confirming the purity of the prepared
sample. Figure 3c shows
the high-resolution XPS O 1s spectrum, in which the O 1s peak is fitted
into two peaks at 528.9 and 531.0 eV related to lattice oxygen and
VOs, respectively. The high-intensity VOs peak
indicates that the Bi2O3 nanosheets are rich
in VOs.67 These results further
support the potential of sunlight-driven combustion method to create
oxygen vacancies on the surface of the synthesized oxides. High-resolution
XPS 4f also shows peaks at 158.5 and 163.7 eV, respectively, related
to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, in agreement with
the reported results (Figure 3d).68

Figure 3 Crystal structure, chemical
structure, and morphology of few-layer
Bi2O3. (a) XRD, (b) XPS survey spectrum, (c)
O 1s XPS spectrum, (d) Bi 4f XPS spectrum, (e, f) SEM images, and
(g, h) TEM images of Bi2O3 synthesized by sunlight-driven
combustion method.

The SEM images in Figures 3e and S7 show
the porous structure
of Bi2O3, which is induced by the gas evolution
during the combustion. In fact, the porous structure, gained from
the gases releasing during the combustion process, is the signature
of the combustion synthesis. The higher-resolution SEM image (Figure 3f) shows that the
morphology of the as-prepared SDC Bi2O3 is nanosheets.
It is also clear that the nanosheets are well separated. The nonagglomeration
of the obtained Bi2O3 nanosheets may be induced
by the gases evolved during the combustion. The TEM images show that
the morphology of SDC Bi2O3 is a few-layered
nanosheets (Figure 3g,h). This is yet another advantage achieved during the sunlight-assisted
combustion synthesis.

3.5 Sunlight-Driven Synthesis of Bi2O3/ZnO Heterostructure
The proposed sunlight-driven
combustion process was also used to prepare ZnO/Bi2O3 heterostructure. Later, the heterostructure was characterized
by XPS to confirm the interaction between both metal oxides (Bi2O3 and ZnO) and by SEM to determine the morphology. Figure 4a shows the XPS survey
spectrum for the Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure,
in which the Bi, Zn, and O peaks are present. The absence of any other
elements except a small amount of C from the sample holder confirms
again the phase purity. Figure 4b–d shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p,
Bi 4f, and O 1s. The peaks at 1022.2 and 1045.2 eV are in agreement
with those of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively
(Figure 4b). The difference
between Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 as 23 eV confirms
the normal state of Zn2+ in ZnO.

morphology. (a) XPS survey spectrum, (b)
Zn 2p XPS image, (c) Bi 4f XPS spectrum, (d) O 1s XPS spectrum, and
(e, f) SEM images of Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure
synthesized by sunlight-driven combustion method.

The two signals located at 158.64 and 164 eV correspond
to the
binding energies of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2. Compared
to the pristine Bi2O3 (Section 3.4), Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 of Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure exhibit a shift
to higher binding energy. Such a shift indicates that the photogenerated
electrons transfer from Bi2O3 to ZnO which is
in disagreement with the photogenerated electron transfer in the reported
Bi2O3/ZnO heterojunctions.68,69 Thus, the sunlight-driven combustion-synthesized Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure is not a heterojunction system, but it
is a direct Z-scheme system. In fact, Z-scheme charge transfer can
improve the charge separation and redox ability for the developed
material and thereby enhance the photocatalytic activity.70 O 1s was fitted to two peaks at 529.04 and 530.46
eV related to lattice oxygen and oxygen atoms in the vicinity of VOs, respectively68 (Figure 4d). Thus, XPS analysis confirms
the successful formation of Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure
using sunlight-driven solution combustion process. The ZnO nanoparticles-decorated
2D nanosheet morphology for the Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure
is represented in Figure 4e,f.

3.6 Photocatalytic Activity of Bi2O3 Nanosheets and Bi2O3/ZnO Heterostructure
The photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3 nanosheets
and Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructures prepared by sunlight-driven
combustion (Bi2O3 SDC and Bi2O3/ZnO SDC) was compared to that of the counterparts synthesized
by conventional solution combustion (Bi2O3 CSC
and Bi2O3/ZnO CSC), and the results are shown
in Figure 5a. It can
be seen that about 64, 40, 96, and 82% of RhB were degraded by Bi2O3 SDC, Bi2O3 CSC, Bi2O3/ZnO SDC, and Bi2O3/ZnO
CSC, respectively, after 80 min of sunlight irradiation. To compare
the RhB photodegradation catalyzed by different photocatalysts, the
degradation data were fitted according to the pseudo-first-order kinetic
model as expressed by eq 4 (Figure 5b)71 4  where k, C0, and C are the kinetic rate constant,
the RhB initial concentration, and the RhB concentration at time t, respectively. The k and correlation
coefficient (R2) values are listed in Table 1. The R2 values for all of the samples are more than 98%, indicating
that the data fitting using the pseudo-first-order kinetics model
is reasonable. It can also be observed from Table 1 that the samples prepared by sunlight-driven
combustion method (Bi2O3 SDC and Bi2O3/ZnO SDC) exhibit a higher kinetic rate constant than
those synthesized by the conventional solution combustion method (Bi2O3 CSC and Bi2O3/ZnO CSC).
These findings further elucidate the importance of the developed synthesis
method.

Figure 5 (a) Photocatalytic degradation curves and (b) degradation kinetic
curves of RhB over Bi2O3/ZnO SDC, Bi2O3/ZnO CSC, Bi2O3 SDC, and Bi2O3 CSC under sunlight irradiation, and reusability
of (c) Bi2O3 SDC and (d) Bi2O3/ZnO SDC (RhB concentration = 10 mg L–1,
catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L–1, pH 7).

Table 1 Kinetics Reaction Constant (k) and Correlation Coefficient (R2) for RhB Degradation Catalyzed by Bi2O3 SDC,
Bi2O3 CSC, Bi2O3/ZnO SDC,
and Bi2O3/ZnO CSC
 	R2	k	
Bi2O3 SDC	0.99284	0.0123	
Bi2O3 CSC	0.99202	0.00611	
Bi2O3/ZnO SDC	0.98461	0.03754	
Bi2O3/ZnO CSC	0.99486	0.02016	
It is clear also that both Bi2O3 SDC and
Bi2O3/ZnO SDC are photostable even after four
cycles of photocatalytic degradation of RhB (Figure 5c,d); no remarkable decrease in the photocatalytic
performance was observed after four cycles of RhB degradation under
sunlight irradiation.

3.7 Z-Scheme Charge Transport Evidence
XPS analysis indicated that the charge migration follows the Z-scheme
approach (Section 3.5). Scavengers experiments were used here to further prove the Z-scheme
charge transport in Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure. p-Benzoquinone (BQ) and tert-butyl alcohol
(TBA) were added into the photocatalyst/dye suspension to trap superoxide
radicals (•O2–) and
hydroxyl radicals (•OH), respectively, followed
by the photocatalytic assessments. Figure 6a shows that both BQ and TBA significantly
suppressed the RhB degradation by Bi2O3/ZnO
under sunlight irradiation, indicating that both •O2– and •OH are produced
during the photodegrading process.

Figure 6 (a) Effect of TBA and BQ on RhB degradation
over ZnO/Bi2O3 SDC under sunlight irradiation
and comparison of charge
transport in Bi2O3/ZnO SDC heterostructure based
on (b) heterojunction and (c) Z-scheme approaches.

The positions of CBM and VBM are, respectively,
−0.36 and
2.67 V for ZnO, and 0.18 and 2.92 V for Bi2O3.52 If charge transport follows heterojunction
approach, the electrons will migrate to CB of Bi2O3 and holes to VB of ZnO (Figure 6b). The potential at CBM of Bi2O3 (0.18 V) is not enough to produce •O2– because O2/•O2 potential is −0.046 V. Thus, the heterojunction
approach cannot explain the production of •O2– proved by scavengers experiments. Whereas,
if charge transport follows the Z-scheme approach, the electrons will
migrate to CB of ZnO and the holes will remain in the VB of Bi2O3 (Figure 6c). The CBM of ZnO has enough potential (−0.36 V) to
produce •O2–, which
is proved by scavengers experiments. Thus, the Bi2O3/ZnO heterostructure is a Z-scheme system. These results well
agree with the XPS analysis.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
developed a novel, facile, and sustainable
sunlight-driven combustion method to synthesize porous metal oxide
nanostructures. Surprisingly, in this method, the direct exposure
to sunlight creates VOs on the surface of oxides and induces
homogeneous heating, which facilitates the uniformity in particle
size and pore size distribution. UV–vis DRS, Tauc plot, VB-XPS,
and Mott–Schottky analyses indicated that ZnO SDC has a narrower
band gap (3.07 eV) than ZnO CSC (3.19 eV). The ESR analysis confirmed
that ZnO SDC exhibits higher exciton dissociation and thereby higher
concentration of free electrons and holes than ZnO CSC. The band gap
narrowing and the higher exciton dissociation for ZnO SDC were due
to the higher concentration of VOs induced by sunlight
irradiation. It was also demonstrated that few-layer Bi2O3 nanosheets and ZnO/Bi2O3 heterostructures
can be synthesized using the introduced method. ZnO, Bi2O3, and ZnO/Bi2O3 synthesized by
the sunlight-driven combustion method exhibit higher photocatalytic
activity than their conventional counterparts. The cost-effectiveness
of the sunlight-driven combustion method offers an alternative route
for large-scale synthesis of porous metal oxide nanomaterials.
