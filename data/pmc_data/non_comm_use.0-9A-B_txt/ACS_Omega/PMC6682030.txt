Photophysical
studies were carried out for simple amino acids like
alanine and valine with resorcinol-based aqueous acridinedione (ADDR)
dyes. ADDR dyes exhibit interesting excited-state characteristics
on altering the substituents at the 9th and 10th sites (Scheme 1).
The longest-wavelength absorption maxima remain the same on adding
the amino acids to the fluorophore, whereas the excited-state behavior
varies significantly mostly based on the nature of the substituent
at the 9th position. The absence of fluorescence enhancement was observed
with addition of β-alanine, l-alanine, and l-valine to ADDR1 dye (photoinduced electron transfer, PET), whereas
addition of glycine exhibits enhancement accompanied with a shift
toward a longer-wavelength region. Interestingly, the addition of
amino acids to non-PET dyes results in a fluorescence quenching accompanied
with a larger shift toward the shorter-wavelength region. The properties
of fluorophore and nonfluorophore dyes in the presence of alanine
or valine are found to be entirely different from those of glycine.
The interaction of alanine with ADDR dyes is predominantly through
H-bonding, but the structural aspects of H-bonding interactions of
alanine and water are completely different from those of glycine and
water. The time-correlated single-photon counting method portrays
the existence of fluorophore in two distinguishable microenvironments
in the presence of amino acids. The fluorescence spectral technique
used as a tool in elucidating the mode of interaction of dye with
neutral amino acids in aqueous solution is illustrated in the present
study.

Introduction
Amino acids are broadly
classified into three groups, neutral,
acidic, and basic, wherein neutral amino acids have a better solubility
in water compared to other amino acids. Several studies on the H-bonding
characteristics of neutral amino acids have been well established
with respect to glycine and alanine. The H-bonding properties and
the orientation of amino acids with a water molecule in the gaseous
state largely differ from those in the aqueous phase. These amino
acids exist in the neutral form (gaseous) and zwitterionic form in
water. The amino acid possesses two functional groups involved in
the H-bonding interaction, wherein it acts as a H-bond donor as well
as an acceptor. In water, they exist as COO– and
NH3+ possessing both electrostatic and H-bonding
interactions. The orientation of water molecules surrounding amino
acids depends upon the nature of the amino acid. Interestingly, the
mode of H-bonding of alanine widely differs from that of glycine,
which is significant in the field of organized molecular assemblies
with water molecules. There are reports that postulate the nature
of H-bonding, which is based on the number of water molecules surrounding
glycine, alanine, or valine. Even though the alkyl chain length increases
by methyl substitution only, a large variation in the H-bonding arrangement
is visualized.

There are several reports on the role of glycine–water
H-bonding
interactions, but the interaction of simple amino acids with fluorophores
based on charge transfer (CT) and electron transfer (ET) is found
to be very less confined to the field of photophysics.1−7 Glycine acts as a H-bond donor as well as an acceptor and further
behaves like an excellent guest molecule with water, forming various
types of H-bonding patterns. Our earlier report8 reveals that a nonfluorescent amino acid (glycine) interaction
with photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and non-PET-based fluorophore
in aqueous solution have established that the ground-state and excited-state
characteristics of acridinedione dyes are largely influenced and governed
by the H-bonding between amino acids and fluorophore.

Compared
to glycine, alanine is a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid
and l-alanine is the smallest chiral R-amino acid with a
nonreactive methyl group as the side chain. l-alanine interact
favorably with water molecules compared to glycine, which interacts
with water molecules.9 The structural properties
of alanine in aqueous solution differ significantly from those in
the crystalline phase. The structural variation mainly attributed
to H-bonding and the number of water molecules involved in it. The
H-bonding properties of neutral amino acids in water illustrate that
alanine is entirely different from glycine even though there is no
large variation in the structure. In the hydrophobicity scale, alanine
is placed after glycine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine.10,11 The α-carbon atom of alanine is bound to a methyl group, making
it one of the simplest α-amino acids. Compared to glycine, alanine
participates in several metabolic functions like in sugar and acid
metabolism in our body. Alanine enhances the immune system by producing
antibodies; provides energy for muscle tissues, brain, and central
nervous system; and acts as a stimulant for glucagon secretion. It
is also used in pharmaceutical preparations for injection or infusion,
in dietary supplements, and as a flavor compound, which make alanine
more important than glycine.

In spite of the fact that there
are a number of studies on the
H-bonding properties of alanine, a majority of such known reports
are confined and related to theoretical studies only. Quantum mechanical
treatment, molecular modeling, and density functional theory studies
have been carried out in depth regarding the parameters confined to
H-bonding interactions of alanine with water molecules in a gaseous
phase, and the structural parameters are obtained from computational
studies only.12−18 These parameters and information could not be directly applied to
an aqueous phase due to the change in the structural conformation
of amino acids. The widely used experimental zwitterionic structure
of alanine is normally assumed to be the structure in aqueous media,
and this is derived from solid-state crystallographic data. However,
the nature and origin of the zwitterionic form of alanine in the solid
phase and in water are found to be entirely different as ascertained
by spectroscopic techniques12,16−18 like infrared, Raman, and neutron scattering techniques.

To
obtain a clear idea on the H-bonding properties of alanine with
resorcinol-based aqueous acridinedione (ADDR) dyes by fluorescence
spectral studies, we compared the photophysical properties of PET-
and non-PET-based acridinedione dyes with valine and glycine in water.
ADDR dyes have been widely studied mainly as a sensor since they possess
a unique advantage such that both PET and internal charge transfer
(ICT) phenomena exist, which is of significant importance in a single
molecule. Further, according to the literature, an acridine-based
fluorophore acts as a bifunctional molecule such that it behaves like
an electron donor as well as an acceptor. The acridine-based fluorophore
undergoes various interesting excited-state reactions in the presence
of several H-bonding solutes,19−25 metal ions sensors, studies related to anion sensing26−30 and with polymer matrices.31 These dyes
possess a unique advantage over other PET- and ICT-based dyes, which
is due to the variation in the substituent present in the 9th and
10th positions of the basic acridinedione ring structure. The fluorescence
quantum yield, emission, and lifetime of the ADDR1 dye differ largely
from those of ADDR2 and ADDR3 dyes. Further, the nature of the solvent
and solutes considerably influences the excited-state characteristics
and microenvironment of the ADDR1 dye in aqueous solution. We have
reported extensively on the variation of the PET process in the ADDR1
dye such that urea, amides, and proteins suppress the PET process,
while gum arabic (GA) promotes the PET process. The electron transfer
(ET) phenomenon varies with the nature and type of nonfluorophoric
solute employed. Being water-soluble, ADDR dyes have a clear advantage
over other organic dyes (insoluble in water), and the solvent-based
variation in the photophysical nature of ADDR dyes in the presence
of solute plays an important role in the field of fluorescence spectroscopy
concerned with host–guest systems.

Fluorescence spectroscopic
techniques are employed as an ideal
tool to probe the host–guest systems, since no significant
quantum of photophysical properties of alanine with fluorescent probes
are reported in the literature concerned with PET- or ICT-based dyes
to the best of our knowledge. The present investigation focuses mainly
on the large-scale variation in the fluorescence properties (lifetime
and emission intensity) of the ADDR1 dye (PET) with alanine and valine
in aqueous solution in comparison with non-PET-based ADDR in aqueous
medium. The basic structures of the ADDR dyes used in the present
study and the amino acids (glycine, β-alanine, l-alanine,
and l-valine) are provided in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Absorption Spectral Studies
The ADDR1 dye exhibits
a broad absorption peak at around 375 ± 5 nm. This peak maximum
at 375 ± 5 nm is referred to as the ICT absorption maximum. This
is assigned to the charge transfer (CT) from the ring nitrogen (nitrogen
at 9th position) to the carbonyl oxygen in the acridinedione ring
moiety.19 The absorption spectra of the
ADDR1 dye with β-alanine and l-alanine in water are
shown in Figure 1a,b,
respectively.

Figure 1 (a) Absorption spectra of ADDR1 dye + β-alanine:
(1) 0.60
M β-alanine, (2) 1.2 M β-alanine, (3) ADDR1 dye alone,
(4) ADDR1 dye + 0.60 M β-alanine, and (5) ADDR1 dye + 1.2 M
β-alanine. (b) Absorption spectra of ADDR1 dye + l-alanine:
(1) 0.60 M l-alanine, (2) 1.2 M l-alanine, (3) ADDR1
dye alone, (4) ADDR1 dye + 0.60 M l-alanine, and (5) ADDR1
dye + 1.2 M l-alanine.

The ICT absorption maximum of the ADDR1 dye remains the same
with
an increase in the concentration of β-alanine and l-alanine (0.6 and 1.2 M), and this clearly reveals that there is
no change in the absorption maximum on addition of alanine and that
this also does not influence the ICT absorption maximum. A similar
behavioral pattern was also found on addition of glycine to the ADDR1
dye.8 Also, no characteristic change in
the ICT absorption maximum of non-PET-based ADDR dyes was observed
on addition of β-alanine or L-alanine, and the absorption spectra
of non-PET dyes with L-alanine are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2, respectively. In our earlier
studies on several H-bonding solutes19,22−25 with either PET- or non-PET-based ADDR dyes, the ICT absorption
maximum remained unperturbed. This signifies that the ground-state
properties of ADDR dyes are not influenced by the presence of H-bonding
solutes and the nature of interaction between dye and amino acid could
not be clearly established.

Interaction of ADDR dyes with alanine
or valine signifies that
the longest-wavelength absorption maximum remains unperturbed and
least influenced even in the presence of very high concentration of
amino acids (>1.0 M). Several studies based on the H-bonding interaction
and hydrophobic influences of nonfluorophoric guest systems containing
H-bond donor and acceptor moieties with acridinedione dyes were also
carried out in aqueous solutions.19,22−25 It has been well established that the ICT absorption peak maximum
remains the same in the presence of H-bonding solutes and the ground-state
spectral characteristics of both PET- and non-PET-based ADDR dyes
are not influenced by these solutes (urea derivatives, amide derivatives,
and GuHCl). In our present study, the absorption and emission spectral
behavior of the ADDR1 dye with alanine is thoroughly studied and compared
with that with valine and glycine in water. The precise nature of
interaction of PET- or non-PET-based ADDR dyes with neutral amino
acids could not be completely established from absorption spectral
studies. To ascertain the most probable mode of interaction and functional
groups involved in direct interaction of ADDR dyes with alanine, we
carried out steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectral studies
by fixing the concentration of the ADDR dye and varying the concentration
of amino acids.

Emission Spectral Studies
The ADDR1
dye exhibits emission
maximum at 436 ± 2 nm when excited at the ICT absorption maximum.
Addition of β-alanine and l-alanine to the ADDR1 dye
results in a gradual decrease in the fluorescence (not significant)
with no considerable shift in the emission maximum. Emission spectra
of ADDR1 with β-alanine and l-alanine are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

Figure 2 Emission spectra of ADDR1 dye + β-alanine:
(1) ADDR1 dye
alone, (2) ADDR1 dye + 0.075 M β-alanine, (3) ADDR1 dye + 0.15
M β-alanine, (4) ADDR1 dye + 0.30 M β-alanine, (5) ADDR1
dye + 0.45 M β-alanine, and (6) ADDR1 dye + 0.60 M β-alanine.

Figure 3 Emission spectra of ADDR1 dye + l-alanine:
(1) ADDR1 dye
alone, (2) ADDR1 dye + 0.075 M l-alanine, (3) ADDR1 dye +
0.15 M l-alanine, (4) ADDR1 dye + 0.30 M l-alanine,
(5) ADDR1 dye + 0.45 M l-alanine, and (6) ADDR1 dye + 0.60
M l-alanine.

Interestingly, the decrease in the fluorescence intensity
of ADDR1
dye is negligibly small based on the phenomenon of fluorescence quenching
such that the excited-state behavior of ADDR1 dye is influenced to
some extent in the presence of alanine. Although both glycine and
alanine belong to the class of simple amino acids, their role in the
fluorescence emission characteristics of ADDR1 dye is found to be
strikingly different. Addition of glycine to the ADDR1 dye results
in a larger extent of fluorescence enhancement accompanied with a
red shift in the emission maximum, which is not observed in the case
of β-alanine or l-alanine. Studies related to the ADDR1
dye in the presence of urea, amides, GuHCl, and bovine serum albumin
in water resulted in a fluorescence enhancement except in the case
of GA.34 This clearly implies that the
excited-state nature of the ADDR1 dye is governed by the nature of
the solute, even though all of the solutes belong to the same class
of well-structured H-bonding self-assemblies. The addition of valine
to the ADDR1 dye also resulted in a pattern of decrease in the fluorescence
intensity similar to that observed in alanine. Interestingly, the
local-excited (LE)-state emission maximum of the ADDR dye on addition
of valine follows a pattern similar to that observed with alanine
but differs completely from that in glycine interaction with the ADDR1
dye. The emission spectrum of ADDR1 with valine is shown in Supporting
Information Figure S3. From emission spectral
studies of the ADDR1 dye with alanine or valine, a clear illustration
on the role of H-bonding properties and their influence on the LE-state
emission are visualized from the variation in the emission intensity.
Glycine results in a larger extent of fluorescence enhancement, whereas
an increase in the alkyl chain length of amino acids (alanine and
valine) results in neither a considerable shift in the position maxima
nor a change in the fluorescence intensity. The extent of decrease
in the fluorescence intensity of ADDR1 dye in the presence of alanine
and valine is less than 5%, which was not observed in any of the H-bonding
solutes used so far. The difference on the decrease in the fluorescence
quenching, was found to be very less compared to conventional fluorescence
quenching phenomenon and in other words based on the fluorescence
emission intensity values, we can conveniently ascertain that alanine
or valine does not influence the PET process through space in ADDR1
dye like glycine. The variation in the fluorescence intensity of the
ADDR1 dye with various amino acids is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Extent of fluorescence enhancement/quenching
of ADDR1 dye with
various amino acids: (black circle, solid), glycine; (red circle,
solid), β-alanine; (green circle, solid), l-alanine;
and (blue circle, solid), l-valine.

The emission spectrum of non-PET-based ADDR dyes also exhibit
emission
maximum above 440 nm. The LE state emission is at around 440 ±
2 nm, and a broad LE-state-promoted CT state emission occurs in the
emission range of 470 ± 5 nm. Addition of alanine (β-alanine
and l-alanine) or valine to the ADDR2 dye results in a fluorescence
quenching concerned with the emission intensity corresponding to the
CT state, and a gradual quenching of emission intensity at 470 ±
5 nm results. Further, a clear blue shift results and the emission
maxima almost correspond to the LE state emission (440 ± 2 nm)
(Figures 5 and 6). Quite interestingly, the addition of alanine
or valine to the ADDR3 dye results in no significant change in the
fluorescence intensity, as observed in the case of other H-bonding
solutes. Although both ADDR2 and ADDR3 dyes belong to the class of
non-PET nature, their excited-state properties are found to be different
in the presence of alanine or valine. In our report on the interaction
of glycine with the ADDR2 or ADDR3 dye, the extent of fluorescence
quenching was less than 10%, which is contrary to our present results.
Interaction of urea derivatives, amide derivatives, and GuHCl with
the ADDR3 dye does not result in any significant change in the fluorescence
intensity values, and this was attributed to the absence of an electron-donating
group (OCH3) at the para position of the phenyl ring attached
to the 9th carbon of the basic dye structure. The emission spectra
of ADDR2 dye with β-alanine are shown in Figure 5 and those of l-alanine are shown
in Figure 6.

Figure 5 Emission spectra
of ADDR2 dye + β-alanine: (1) ADDR2 dye
alone, (2) ADDR2 dye + 0.075 M β-alanine, (3) ADDR2 dye + 0.15
M β-alanine, (4) ADDR2 dye + 0.30 M β-alanine, (5) ADDR2
dye + 0.45 M β-alanine, and (6) ADDR2 dye + 0.60 M β-alanine.

Figure 6 Emission spectra of ADDR2 dye + l-alanine:
(1) ADDR2 dye
alone, (2) ADDR2 dye + 0.075 M l-alanine, (3) ADDR2 dye +
0.15 M l-alanine, (4) ADDR2 dye + 0.30 M l-alanine,
(5) ADDR2 dye + 0.45 M l-alanine, and (6) ADDR2 dye + 0.60
M l-alanine.

A variation in the fluorescence intensity and a shift in
the emission
maxima are visualized when the solute is changed from glycine to valine.
Addition of valine to the ADDR2 dye also exhibits a similar behavior
to that of alanine. A fluorescence enhancement was observed on addition
of glycine, urea, amide derivatives, and GuHCl to the ADDR1 dye. The
increase in the fluorescence intensity illustrates that these H-bonding
solutes effectively suppress the PET process through space, thereby
increasing the quantum yield. On the contrary, a drastic decrease
in the fluorescence intensity of ADDR1 dye resulted on addition of
GA, which is a well-known food hydrocolloid soluble in water that
contains several H-bonding sugar moieties.34 This quenching phenomenon is completely attributed to the promotion
of PET process through space. This variation in the fluorescence behavior
clearly shows that the PET processes through space are influenced
by the nature of the solute, solute–solvent interactions, and
presence of hydrophobic or hydrophilic moieties. We observe that alanine
or valine does not suppress nor promotes the PET process effectively
compared with glycine8 and other hydrogen-bonding
solutes.19,22,23,35 It is well known that the solute concentration and
the type of solute also play a major role in the microenvironment,
such that the addition of glycine results in a bathochromic shift,
whereas alanine or valine (hydrophobic in nature compared to glycine)
results in no significant shift. Further, urea or amides hardly influence
the excited-state nature of non-PET dyes in water, whereas the LE-state
nature of these dyes is completely quenched in the presence of alanine
or valine and to a certain extent in glycine. The extent of fluorescence
quenching of ADDR2 dye with various amino acids is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Extent of fluorescence
quenching of ADDR2 dye with various amino
acids: (black circle, solid), glycine; (red circle, solid), β-alanine;
(green circle, solid), l-alanine; and (blue circle, solid), l-valine.

From emission spectral
studies, it is evident that β-alanine
or l-alanine interaction with ADDR dyes is entirely different
from that of glycine, and this presumably is attributed to the variation
in the H-bonding arrangement of the amino acid–dye–water
system.

To establish the existence of dye located in distinguishable
microenvironments
of aqueous amino acids, we carried out fluorescence lifetime studies.

Time-Correlated Fluorescence Spectral Properties
The
ADDR1 dye exhibits a lifetime of 500 ± 10 ps in aqueous solution.19 On addition of β-alanine or l-alanine to the ADDR1 dye, the fluorescence lifetime of ADDR dye
becomes biexponential. The PET lifetime component increases, and the
long-lifetime component decreases substantially. The lifetime decay
profiles of the ADDR1 dye with β-alanine and l-alanine
are shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively, and their lifetime components
along with the relative amplitude are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

diode (LED) profile, (2) ADDR1 dye alone, (3) ADDR1 dye + 0.60 M β-alanine,
and (4) ADDR1 dye + 1.2 M β-alanine.

The extent of increase in the PET component 500 ±
10 ps of
the ADDR1 dye is more predominant in the case of β-alanine rather
in l-alanine. The increase in the fluorescence lifetime of
ADDR1 dye from 500 ps up to 750 ps in the presence of alanine shows
that the PET process is completely suppressed, which results in an
increase in the lifetime of the fluorophore. The biexponential component
of ADDR1 dye with β-alanine reveals that the dye molecule is
situated in two distinguishable microenvironments in water. The long-lifetime-component
distribution is around 25%, whereas the short-lifetime component (PET)
exists in the aqueous phase with 75% amplitude distribution. Even
though l-alanine differs from β-alanine structurally,
it also exhibits two lifetime components similar to β-alanine,
but the lifetime distribution components are entirely different. Addition
of glycine to the ADDR1 dye resulted in two different lifetime components
with varying lifetimes and amplitudes, which differ from those of
alanine. Fluorescence lifetime studies authenticate that the type
of the solute influences the excited-state fluorescence lifetime properties
of the PET-based dye, which is clearly distinguishable from glycine
or alanine. Herewith, we propose that ADDR1 exists in more than one
microenvironment and is correlated to the fluorophore predominantly
surrounded by the water molecule and less number of alanine molecules.
The relatively long-lifetime species is correlated to dye predominately
surrounded by alanine molecules only with more or less number of water
molecules. A similar behavior resulted on introduction of glycine
to the ADDR1 dye.8 We visualize an increase
in the fluorescent lifetime of the PET component from 500 to 740 ps.
A relatively long-lifetime component of 6.00 ns is accompanied with
the PET component also. The fluorescent lifetime of 740 ps is assigned
to the orientation of ADDR1 dye surrounded mainly by the water molecule
only. The long-lifetime component is attributed to the dye surrounded
by less number of water molecules, and the dye resides in a constrained
environment. The coexistence of short- and long-lifetime components
with variation in their lifetime in the presence of alanine illustrates
that β-alanine or l-alanine induces a new microenvironment
in the aqueous phase. An entirely predominant hydrophobic environment
formed in the aqueous medium coexists with dye surrounded by water
molecules. The proportion of hydrophobic environment rapidly changes
on addition of amino acids. The ADDR1 dye is categorized as hydrophobic
dye, and, in general, it prefers to orient toward a more hydrophobic
domain rather than toward the water molecules (hydrophilic environment).
This phenomenon is the reason for the increase in the relative amplitude
of the long-lifetime component on addition of alanine. A similar pattern
of two different lifetime components was also observed in the ADDR1
dye in the presence of valine.

The creation of two distinguishable
microenvironments suggests
that the presence of hydrophobic influences on the H-bonding interaction
is predominant at a higher concentration of amino acid. The creation
and stabilization of the hydrophobic environment results in the orientation
of dye toward the hydrophobic moieties (alanine). The hydrophobic
nature increases with the methyl substitution of the amino acid such
that the proportion of dye in an environment surrounded by glycine
(2.4 M) is 10%, whereas in the case of alanine (1.2 M), the amplitude
distribution is 25%. The gradual increase in the lifetime of PET component
and the existence of the long-lifetime component reveal that alanine
effectively suppresses the PET process; further, it also paves way
for the creation of variation in the microenvironment in the aqueous
phase by the introduction of hydrophobic groups. Interestingly, we
did not observe any fluorescence enhancement of the ADDR1 dye through
steady-state emission spectral studies but a prominent increase in
the fluorescence lifetime of the PET component (0.5 ns) is observed
on addition of alanine. Through time-correlated single-photon counting
(TCSPC) techniques, we authenticate that alanine suppresses the PET
process similar to H-bonding solutes, which results in an increase
in the fluorescence lifetime of the ADDR1 dye. Fluorescence lifetime
characteristics of alanine with the ADDR dye are almost similar to
those with glycine. Addition of valine results in a decrease in the
PET component as well as the non-PET component of the ADDR1 dye, but
the decrease in the PET component was found to be less (500 ±
10 to 400 ± 10 ps) (Supporting Information Figure S4). This is in accordance with the decrease in the
fluorescence intensity of the ADDR1 dye in the presence of valine
through steady-state measurements. A gradual decrease in the PET lifetime
component with an increase in the concentration of valine reveals
that the fluorescence lifetime behavior of the ADDR1 dye in the presence
of valine is completely different from that with alanine.

Fluorescence
Lifetime Studies of ADDR2 Dye with Alanine
The ADDR2 dye
exhibits a long-fluorescence-lifetime component of
8.3 ± 0.2 ns in water. The relatively long lifetime of the ADDR2
dye36−39 is attributed to very high fluorescence quantum yield (>0.90),
whereas
the short lifetime observed in the ADDR1 dye is due to the PET process
through space in water.19 Addition of β-alanine
or l-alanine to the ADDR2 dye results in a single exponential
decay as observed in the case of glycine. The fluorescence decay profiles
of the ADDR2 dye with β-alanine, l-alanine, and l-valine are shown in Supporting Information Figures S5–S7, respectively. A small decrease in fluorescence
lifetime from 8.3 to 8.0 ns results at the highest concentration of
alanine. Such a small decrease in the fluorescence lifetime does not
correlate to the conventional fluorescence quenching behavior. A similar
pattern of decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of ADDR2 dye was
also observed in glycine. Interestingly, the proportion of decrease
in the fluorescence intensity of ADDR2 dye by alanine through steady-state
emission spectral measurements was found to be more significant in
the context of the fluorescence quenching phenomenon. This observation
predicts a larger role of alanine in the local-excited-state emission
of the ADDR2 dye, which is apparently seen in the shift in the emission
maximum toward the blue region. The hypsochromic shift suggests a
hydrophobic influence on the excited-state properties of the ADDR2
dye. This type of spectral behavior was not observed in the case of
glycine interaction with ADDR2 dye. Further, no drastic change in
the fluorescence intensity or lifetime and shift in the emission maxima
toward a red or blue region resulted in the case of glycine, whereas
a distinct behavior was obtained in alanine. This confirms that the
properties resulting in a large variation in the photophysical behavior
of ADDR dyes by glycine or alanine are found to be entirely different
and that the structural orientation and mode of H-bonding play a crucial
role.

In spite of observing a large variation in the fluorescence
emission pattern in the presence of alanine compared to that with
glycine, a clear mode of interaction between glycine with non-PET
dyes could be established. No concrete or precise information regarding
the fluorescence lifetime as compared to that of PET dye was obtained
in the case of glycine. A characteristic bathochromic shift was observed
in the ADDR1 dye, whereas no significant shift of the emission maximum
of ADDR2 or ADDR3 dye resulted on addition of glycine. Furthermore,
the nature of interaction is not determined only through H-bonding,
but hydrophobic influences also coexist; however, hydrophobic influences
have a lesser contribution and are found to be less predominant compared
to H-bonding. From the above results, we have provided a schematic
representation of the ADDR1 dye with alanine in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Schematic Representation of ADDR Dye Interaction
with Alanine
H-bonding Arrangement in
Water: Alanine versus Glycine
The variation in the photophysical
characteristics of various ADDR
dyes in the presence of alanine is found to be entirely different
from that in the presence of glycine. This is predominantly attributed
to the variation in the H-bonding nature of glycine–water from
that of alanine–water framework. The nature of interaction
varies extensively based on the number of water molecules surrounding
the amino acid. Ide et al. reported on the structure of water in solutions
containing various amino acids at neutral pH and proposed that the
water structure is not influenced by the nature and the length of
the amino acid side chains.40 If the above
statement would have been applied for all neutral amino acids, a similar
pattern of behavior would have been resulted for glycine, alanine,
or valine irrespective of the nature of the substituent. On the contrary,
a difference in the fluorescence emission behavior results on moving
from glycine to alanine. Further, it has been well established that
the hydration numbers41,42 for the ammonium group largely
differ for glycine to alanine. The value being 3.0 refers to glycine,
and 2.4 corresponds to alanine such that the amino acid hydration
structure depends on the type of the amino acid and the presence of
substitution in the R group of the amino acid.42−44 Several other
experimental studies on the structural properties of water with amino
acids reveal that the existence of a zwitterionic structure and the
number of water molecules surrounding the amino acid influence the
H-bonding interactions. Even though the structure and dynamic properties
of various amino acids in aqueous solutions were obtained through
computer simulation studies, no clear experimental proof in aqueous
solution has validated those theoretical findings. This is largely
attributed to the presence of more number of water molecules, which
is not included in many theoretical studies. Fluorescence spectral
techniques using probes in aqueous solution containing H-bonding solutes
are influenced by the water molecules. In our present study, the fluorescence
spectral behavior of alanine varies with that of glycine, which is
predominantly attributed to the variation in the number of water molecules
surrounding the amino acid. This results in a difference in the number
of water molecules present in the hydration sphere surrounding the
amino acids and the number of water molecules directly involved in
H-bonding with amino acid and dye. On the contrary, the structural
parameters of amino acid–water interactions and their vibrational
spectra and the stability of the zwitterionic structure in aqueous
media have been thoroughly studied using ab initio methods. The studies
confirm that the less number of water molecules resulting in a marked
difference in the H-bonding properties of amino acids in aqueous and
gaseous phase. Both hydrophobic influences and H-bonding interactions
along with electrostatic interactions differ from the hydration sphere
surrounding the close vicinity of alanine.13−15,45−49 This results in the creation of several microenvironments in the
aqueous phase containing alanine, which differ in the H-bonding pattern.
The formation and the stabilization of these microenvironments depend
upon the concentration of the amino acid.

In the interaction
of ADDR1 dye with glycine or alanine, biexponential decay signifies
the existence of dye in two different domains that are dependent on
the concentration and the nature of the amino acid. Due to less quantum
yield of the ADDR1 dye, an increase in the fluorescence lifetime and
emission is clearly visualized on addition of amino acids. Since ADDR2
and ADDR3 dyes possess a very high quantum yield (0.90), the magnitude
of fluorescence quenching on addition of amino acids could not be
easily ascertained due to the lesser decrease in the fluorescence
lifetime.

Conclusions
Photophysical studies
of the ADDR dye with alanine and valine in
aqueous solution illustrate that the fluorescence spectral characteristics
of both resorcinol-based acridinedione dyes are governed through H-bonding
interactions and hydrophobic influences. Introduction of alanine amino
acid promotes the creation of a new environment comprising several
subdomains, which is heterogeneous and arising several phases. These
microenvironments are alanine–water, alanine–alanine,
and alanine–dye assemblies in the aqueous phase. The existence
of biexponential lifetime components of ADDR1 with alanine illustrates
the existence of more than one domain in which the dye resides. The
mode of interaction of ADDR1 dye with alanine is mostly by H-bonding,
but the dye molecule selectively orients toward the hydrophobic phase
when the concentration of the amino acid increases. An increase in
the PET component and the formation of a long-lifetime component authenticate
that alanine results in suppression of the PET phenomenon but also
pushes favorably the dye toward the region where several alanine molecules
reside and a fewer number of water molecules are present (hydrophobic
domain). Briefly, neutral and essential amino acids like alanine and
valine act as excellent molecules to study in depth the fluorescence
emission lifetime and quantum yield behavior of both PET- and non-PET-based
acridinedione dyes in water. Fluorescence spectral techniques are
used as an efficient marker for underlying photophysical properties
of ADDR dyes in the presence of amino acids.

Experimental Methods
Absorption spectral studies were performed using an Agilent 8453
diode array spectrophotometer, fluorescence spectral studies (emission
spectra) were performed using a Fluoromax-4P spectrometer (Horiba
Jobin Yvon), and the spectral data were smoothened using Origin 6.1
software. The emission spectrum was corrected as per the literature
reported.32,33 Time-resolved fluorescence decays were obtained
by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) method19 using a tunable laser source of 377 nm and a
nano LED of 370 nm. The experimental setup is provided in the Supporting Information.
