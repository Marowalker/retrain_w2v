Two bisphosphonic
acid-functionalized cross-linkers (one novel)
with different spacer chain characteristics were synthesized and incorporated
into hydrogels by copolymerization with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
at different ratios to control the hydrogels’ swelling, mechanical
properties, and ability to support mineralization for biomedical applications.
The cross-linkers were synthesized by reaction of 2-isocyanatoethyl
methacrylate and bisphosphonated diamines followed by selective dealkylation
of the bisphosphonate ester groups. The hydrogels provide in vitro
growth of carbonated apatite, morphology affected by the cross-linker
structure. The hydrogels exhibit a high Young’s modulus E (up to 400 kPa) and can sustain up to 10.2 ± 0.1
MPa compressive stresses. E and hence the cross-link
density significantly increases upon mineralization reflecting the
formation of many bisphosphonate BP–Ca2+ bonds acting
as additional cross-links. Cyclic mechanical tests reveal self-recoverability
of hydrogels because of reversible nature of BP–Ca2+ bonds. The results suggest that these cross-linkers can add calcium-binding
abilities to hydrogels synthesized from any monomer and improve their
mechanical, swelling, and mineralization properties and hence are
potentially useful materials for biomedical applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Hydrogels are three-dimensional
hydrophilic polymeric networks,
obtainable from a wide range of natural or synthetic hydrophilic polymers,
which have various properties resembling living tissues; mostly because
of their high water absorbing ability.1,2 This resemblance
makes them attractive candidates for tissue engineering scaffolds.
The properties of a hydrogel, such as swelling, porosity, elasticity,
permeability to oxygen, various biological molecules, and nutrients,
can in principle be tailored by the hydrogel’s design aspects.

Tissue engineering, in the context of bones and bone-like tissues
involves mineralization because these tissues are organic–inorganic
hybrid composite matrices. For this purpose, it is appropriate to
use hydrogels containing anionic groups, which are found to improve
rates of biomineralization. The hydrogels can serve as organic templates
within which hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) crystals can be synthesized; as in a way
similar to natural bone.3−7 The hydrogel templates with designed chemical functionalities have
the potential to control the type, shape, size, distribution, and
organization of the inorganic crystals as well as specific cell binding
during mineralization. The anionic functional groups such as phosphate,
phosphonate, carboxylate, sulfonate, and hydroxyl can induce nucleation
and growth of HAP under physiological conditions.4,8−13 The functional group also imparts properties such as hydrophilicity,
bimolecular recognition, and enhanced cytocompatibility.4 The effect of chemical functionality as well
as hydrophobicity of the templating matrix on mineralization has been
well studied.14 The microstructure of the
hydrogels coupled with the pH and gel strength also affects the formation
of various nanocrystals such as brushite, octacalcium phosphate, monetite,
and HAP in methacrylate-based hydrogels.15 The mineralization on anionic gelatin methacrylate hydrogels was
found to be related to the changes in physicochemical properties of
the hydrogel including its charge density and degree of swelling.10

Phosphorous-containing polymers have been
implemented to improve
and accelerate the formation of native tissue both by mimicking the
native role of phosphorous groups in the body and by attachment of
other bioactive molecules.16 The hydrogels
containing phosphate and phosphonate groups mineralize faster and
more completely than analogues lacking the phosphorus-containing groups
and also feature better cell adhesion and growth.17−27 In this context, Gemeinhart et al. developed a copolymer hydrogel
of vinyl phosphonic acid (VPA) and acrylamide and found that at 30%
VPA concentration, osteoblast-like cells exhibit better proliferation,
adhesion, differentiation, and ability to mineralize the polymer surface
than at other concentrations of VPA;18 other
work observed that ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate-containing
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) diacrylate hydrogels promote human mesenchymal
stem cells adhesion and spreading;20 and
hydrogels based on a phosphoester–PEG polymer promoted the
gene expression of bone-specific markers including type I collagen
and osteonectin without the addition of growth factors or other biological
agents, compared with pure PEG-based gels.24

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are structural analogues of naturally
existing
pyrophosphate with increased chemical and enzymatic stability.28 They have strong affinity for bone mineral,
HAP, enabling them to chelate calcium ions and to prevent bone dissolution.29 Therefore there is a growing interest in the
use of BPs in combinations with scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.30 A hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan, HA) hydrogel
functionalized with BP groups allows not only mineralization by the
strong interaction between BP groups and Ca2+ ions but
also release of bone morphogenic protein-2, necessary for bone formation,
controlled by the amount of BP groups.31−33 HA hydrogel with a chemical
gradient of matrix-linked BP groups leads to graded biomineralization
of the matrix.34 Nanocomposite hydrogels
based on reversible bonds between calcium phosphate nanoparticles
or bioactive glass and BP-functionalized HA or gelatin display self-healing
as well as adhesiveness to mineral surfaces such as HAP and show potential
in bone-tissue engineering.35−37 Incorporation of bisphosphonic
acid groups in dental monomer structures increases their interaction
with dental tissues. In our previous work, urea dimethacrylates functionalized
with BP and bisphosphonic acid groups were synthesized and evaluated
for dental applications.38 The general
structure of these monomers allows choice of different spacer chains
between the double bonds, which will naturally modify their various
properties.

The objective of this study was to synthesize bisphosphonic
acid
group containing cross-linkers, incorporate them in poly(2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate) hydrogels, and to investigate the effect of the bisphosphonic-acid
functionalization on hydrogel properties. Because the bisphosphonic
acid groups have strong affinity for bone, we also investigated the
potential of these hydrogels as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering;
so the hydrogels’ mineralization, mechanical properties, and
change of mechanical properties with mineralization was studied, especially
with this application in mind.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Cross-linkers
Two bisphosphonic acid-functionalized
urea dimethacrylates (2a, 2b) with different spacer chain characteristics
between double bonds were synthesized and used as cross-linkers for
fabrication of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)-based hydrogels.
Monomers (2a, 2b) were synthesized by the reaction of two bisphosphonated
amines (BPA1 and BPA2) with 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (IEM) to
form BP-containing monomers (1a, 1b), followed by the dealkylation
of the BP groups by trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr) (Figure 1). Synthesis of 1a and 2a as
well as their starting amine BPA1 was reported earlier by us;38,39 however, 1b and 2b are novel. The acidic monomers (2a, 2b) were
obtained as white colored waxy solids in 52–75% yields. All
of the monomers (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b) are well soluble in water (Table S1). The acid monomers 2a and 2b are insoluble
in weakly polar compounds such as ether as opposed to 1a and 1b.

Figure 1 Synthesis
of bisphosphonic acid-functionalized cross-linkers.

The structures of the monomers were confirmed by
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR spectrum of 1b shows characteristic peaks of methine
protons as a triplets of triplet at 3.09 ppm, methylene protons attached
to methine as triplet of doublets at 3.68 ppm, and double-bond
protons at 5.49 and 6.06 ppm. The broad peak next to one of the double
bonds (6 ppm) indicates NH protons (Figure 2). In the 13C NMR spectrum of
1b, the triplet seen at 36.18 ppm is due to the methine carbon attached
to phosphorus (Figure 3). The NMR spectra of 2b support the dealkylation process with the
almost complete disappearance of ethyl peaks of the phosphonate groups
(1.27, 4.07 ppm in 1H NMR and 16.42, 63.01–62.48
ppm in 13C NMR) (Figures 2 and 3). The FTIR spectra of
the acid monomers show broad peaks in the region of 3200–2600
and 2300–2100 cm–1 due to OH stretching and
strong peaks at 1712, and 1699 cm–1 because of two
different C=O stretchings (Figure 4). Also, the strong bands at 996 and 912
cm–1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric
vibration of P–O.

Synthesis of Hydrogels
Bisphosphonic acid-functionalized
cross-linkers 2a and 2b were copolymerized with HEMA via photoinitiated
polymerization to obtain hydrogels containing pendant bisphosphonic
acid groups. The hydrogel compositions are shown in Table 1, where the designation of each
composition shows after the letter H for hydrogel, the cross-linker
used, the cross-linker’s weight percentage in the monomer mixture,
and the weight percentage of the monomer mixture in the solution.
For instance H2a:10:25 denotes the hydrogel prepared using 10 wt %
2a cross-linker at a total monomer (2a + HEMA) concentration of 25
wt %. The hydrogels were obtained with a gel fraction Wg between 73 and 92% (Table 1). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of these hydrogels showed porous structures because of the
lyophilization process (Figure 5), but different morphologies indicate that the cross-linker
structure affects the hydrogels’ microstructure.

Swelling Studies
The swelling behavior of the hydrogels
prepared using 2a and 2b cross-linkers was studied in water and in
1 M CaCl2 solution (Figure 6). Because 2a and 2b cross-linkers are strong electrolytes,
bisphosphonic acid groups are expected to be fully ionized even in
water for both of the hydrogels. 2b has longer and more hydrophilic
chain segments between cross-link junctions. In addition, hydrogels
prepared from 2b will have less cross-linking density at the same
composition (wt %) because of its slightly higher molecular weight
(890 g/mol) compared with 2a (774 g/mol). Therefore, the hydrogels
prepared from 2b might be expected to have higher swelling extent
than those prepared from 2a. However, the swelling behavior of the
hydrogels does not agree with this expectation. The hydrogels based
on 2a showed higher percentage of swelling (SP) than those of 2b-based
ones, which may be explained by the higher concentration of hydrophilic
bisphosphonic acid groups in the first one. This means that the hydrophilic
effect of the bisphosphonic acid groups overcomes the expected tendency
of shorter cross-linkers to produce denser networks; moreover, it
also dominates over the hydrophilic effect of the linkage. Furthermore,
increasing the amount of cross-linker from 5 (H2a:5:20 and H2b:5:20)
to 10 wt % (H2a:10:20 and H2b:10:20) leads to an increase in the degree
of swelling. This is expected because of the simultaneous increase
of the hydrophilicity of the polymer network. Increasing the total
monomer concentration from 20 to 25 wt % at a fixed cross-linker content
also increases the degree of swelling, and the maximum swelling percentages
of 350 and 275 were recorded for H2a:10:25 and H2b:10:25 hydrogels,
respectively. The hydrogels immersed in 1 M CaCl2 solution
showed lower swelling because of the formation of physical cross-linking
through BP groups.

Figure 6 SP of the hydrogels.

Mineralization of Hydrogels
It is known that the interaction
of acid functional monomers with calcium or HAP can be influenced
by the alkyl chain length or chains with different hydrophilicities
in their structures.40 It was also shown
that small changes in matrix hydrophobicity can influence the Ca2+ binding and formation of HAP-like mineral phases on hydrogel
matrices. For example, PEG hydrogels modified with varying lengths
of anionic pendant side chains promotes mineralization for chains
containing up to five methylene groups, a further increase in side-chain
length causes a reduction of apatite nucleation.14 Therefore, it is natural to expect that mineralization
of calcium phosphates on HEMA hydrogels synthesized with 2a or 2b
will be significantly different.

Mineralization experiments
of the synthesized hydrogels were performed in simulated body fluid
(SBF), which closely mimics the ionic concentrations and pH typically
observed in plasma. After soaking in SBF for 2 and 4 weeks, their
mineralization was studied using FTIR, SEM, X-ray diffractometer (XRD),
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and calcium assay. The Ca2+ content of the hydrogels was determined using the calcium assay
(Figure 7). The amount
of calcium reached after 4 weeks of incubation was 11 ± 1 and
9.4 ± 0.7 μg/mg of dry H2a:10:20 and H2b:10:20 hydrogels.
Both types of hydrogels exhibited similar and high calcium content,
indicating the role of bisphosphonic acid functional group in the
nucleation of minerals. The small difference in the extent of mineralization
can be explained by the higher concentration of bisphosphonic acid
functionality in 2a-based hydrogels compared with that of 2b-based
ones, as well as structural differences between cross-linkers.

Figure 7 Ca2+ content of the hydrogels (H2a:10:20 and H2b:10:20)
after 4 weeks of mineralization in water (control) and SBF.

SEM images indicated that the
hydrogels were covered with a mineral
layer with spherical mineral clusters (Figure 5). EDX was used to determine the elemental
content of the mineralized hydrogels and showed the presence of C,
O, P, Ca, and Mg in all mineralized samples. The presence of Mg2+ is probably due to substitution of Ca2+ within
the CaP lattice.41 Therefore, Suzuki et
al. evaluated both Ca/P and (Ca + Mg)/P ratios in their mineralization
experiments.42 The hydrogels before mineralization
did not show Ca and Mg ions, the intensity of the P peak was much
lower than that of the mineralized hydrogels (Figure 8). The Ca/P and (Ca + Mg)/P ratios of the
mineral layers were found to be 0.8–1.08 and 1.21 and 1.40
for H2a:10:20 and H2b:10:20 hydrogels, respectively. HAP is the major
component of bone and other biological apatites; therefore, the theoretical
stoichiometric ratio of calcium to phosphate (Ca/P) is 1.67.42 The Ca/P ratios in amorphous calcium phosphate
[Ca3(PO4)2], brushite [(CaHPO4)3–H2O], and octacalcium phosphate
[Ca8(PO4)6H2] are 1.5,
1.0, and 1.33, respectively.43 These results
indicate that the mineral regions of the mineralized hydrogels have
composition similar to biological apatite. The XRD spectra of mineralized
hydrogels were similar to those of biological apatites, especially
with respect to the peak at 32° (Figure 9).44 It was also
observed that mineralization was favored by hydrogels containing 2b
compared with that of 2a. The longer chain of 2b increases flexibility
and may allow the Ca2+ bound chains to attain conformations
favoring the formation of apatite crystals.

Mechanical Properties
Mechanical properties of the
synthesized hydrogels were determined by uniaxial compression tests. Figures 10a,b presents typical
stress–strain curves of H2a:X:25 and H2b:X:25 hydrogels equilibrium
swollen in water (solid blue curves) and in aqueous 1 M CaCl2 solution (dashed red curves). The content of the cross-linker X
(2a or 2b) is indicated. For both cross-linkers, increasing the cross-linker
content decreases the fracture stress and strain of the hydrogels
in water. However, when measured in CaCl2 solution instead
of water (dashed vs solid curves), the fracture stress and hence the
energy to break (toughness) significantly increases. For instance,
the toughness of H2a:10:25 hydrogel calculated from the area under
the stress–strain curve up to the fracture point increases
fivefold upon immersion in 1 M CaCl2 solution (from 88
 ± 10 to 430  ± 30 kJ·m–3). A similar increase in toughness is also observable for H2b:10:25
hydrogel (from 66  ± 8 to 312   ± 25
kJ·m–3). The toughness improvement in the hydrogel
can be explained with the formation of noncovalent bonds between bisphosphonic
acid groups and Ca2+ ions in the salt solution. These physical
cross-links acting as reversible sacrificial bonds that easily break
under stress, dissipate energy and hence prevent crack propagation
and macroscopic fracture at low stresses.45,46

Figure 10 Stress–strain curves of H2a:X:25 (a) and H2b:X:25 hydrogels
(b) at various cross-linker contents in water (solid curves) and in
aqueous 1 M CaCl2 solution (dashed curves). Nominal stress
σnom is plotted against strain ε at a strain
rate of 1.8 × 10–2 s–1.

In Figure 11, Young’s
modulus E and fracture stress σf of H2a:X:25 hydrogels in water (circles) and in 1 M CaCl2 solution (triangles) are plotted against the cross-linker (2a) content.
It is seen that the modulus E of the hydrogel measured
in water does not change with the increasing cross-linker (2a) content,
whereas it rapidly increases when measured in 1 M CaCl2 solution. For instance, E of H2a:20:25 hydrogel
is 104  ± 25 and 400  ± 30 kPa
in water and in CaCl2 solution, respectively. This finding
also reflects the formation of noncovalent cross-links due to the
Ca2+ ions contributing significantly to the cross-link
density and hence to the modulus of the hydrogels. Because these additional
cross-links are reversible in nature, they lead to about 10-fold increase
in the fracture stress of the hydrogels. The results also show that
when immersed in CaCl2 solution, 2a-based hydrogels are
mechanically stronger than 2b-based ones indicating stronger bisphosphate–Ca2+ interactions in the former hydrogels (Figure S1). This can be explained by the lower molecular weight
of 2a as compared to 2b, leading to higher concentration of bisphosphonic
acid groups in 2a-based hydrogels. The results also reveal that incubation
of hydrogel samples in the Ca2+/Mg2+ containing
SBF during mineralization would also lead to their strengthening.

modulus E and fracture stress σf of the hydrogels in water (circles) and in aqueous 1 M CaCl2 solution (triangles) plotted against the cross-linker (2a)
content. Total monomer concentration = 25 wt %.

We also observed that reducing the monomer concentration
at the
gel preparation significantly improves the mechanical properties.
For instance, the solid and dashed curves in Figure 12a are stress–strain curves of the
hydrogels prepared at a monomer concentration of 20 and 25 wt %, respectively.
The cross-linker (2b) concentration was fixed at 10 wt %. Although
the modulus E decreases from 78  ± 2
to 32  ± 1 kPa with decreasing monomer concentration
because of the dilution of the network chains, the fracture stress
σf significantly increases from 0.5 to 9.4  ± 1.1
MPa. The hydrogel formed at 20 wt % concentration sustains up to about
96% compression ratios. Because the chemically cross-linked hydrogels
are generally brittle in nature, the results suggest existence of
the reversible intermolecular bisphosphonic acid bonds in the hydrogels
contributing to their mechanical properties.

H2b:10:25 hydrogels (dashed curve) formed at monomer concentrations
of 20 and 25 wt %, respectively. (b,c) Cyclic compressive test results

(c) for H2b:10:20 hydrogel equilibrium swollen in water. The inset
to (c) shows the hysteresis energy Uhys plotted against εmax (circles) and the number of
cycles up to εmax = 90% (triangles).

Cyclic mechanical tests could provide a mean to
detect the existence
of reversible cross-links in hydrogels.45,46 Such tests
were conducted by compressing hydrogel samples up to a maximum strain
εmax (loading step), followed by retraction to zero
force (unloading step) and a waiting time of 5 min before the next
cycle of compression. Figure 12b,c shows typical results of three successive loading/unloading
experiments conducted on H2b:10:20 hydrogel specimens. The tests were
conducted by increasing εmax from 50 to 90% (b) and
for three successive cycles up to εmax = 90% (b).
The loading and unloading curves are shown by the solid and dashed
curves, respectively. The loading curve is always different from the
unloading curve (“hysteresis behavior”) indicating damage
in the gel sample and dissipation of energy. However, each loading
curve follows the path of the previous loading indicating that the
damage in the gel is repaired during 5 min of waiting time between
the cycles. The hysteresis energies Uhys were calculated from the area between loading and unloading curves.
The inset in Figure 12c shows Uhys plotted against the maximum
strain εmax (circles) and the number of cycles for
εmax = 90% (triangles). Uhys increases with εmax revealing that increasing number
of bonds are reversibly broken as the strain is increased. For εmax = 90%, Uhys is almost constant
(78  ± 14 kJ·m–3) in three successive
cycles indicating self-recoverability of the present hydrogels.

To highlight the effect of Ca2+ ions on the number of
noncovalent bonds reversibly broken under strain, cyclic mechanical
tests were conducted on H2a:10:20 hydrogel specimens immersed in water
and in 1 M CaCl2 solution. The results are shown in Figure 13a,b for four successive
cycles with increasing εmax from 50 to 80% compression.
The inset showing the εmax-dependence of Uhys reveals that Uhys is much larger in CaCl2 solution than in water. Moreover,
the larger the εmax, the larger the difference is
between the Uhys’s measured in
water and in CaCl2 solution indicating stronger bisphosphonate
BP–Ca2+ bonds as compared to hydrogen bonds between
BPs. Figure 13c presents
three successive cycles up to εmax = 80% conducted
on H2a:10:20 hydrogels in water and in CaCl2 solution.
The reversibility of the cycles is obvious with hysteresis energies Uhys = 7.7 ± 0.4 and 27 ± 3 kJ·m–3 in water and in CaCl2 solution, respectively. Uhys that is 3.5-fold larger in the presence
of Ca2+ ions indicates the reversible nature of additional
BP–Ca2+ bonds. The results thus reveal that the
hydrogels presented here have the ability to self-recover without
any external stimulus.

and in 1 M CaCl2 solution (triangles). (c) Three successive

Conclusions
The
use of bisphosphonic acid-functionalized dimethacrylates as
cross-linkers in the synthesis of biomaterials for mineralization
was shown in HEMA-based hydrogels. The presence of bisphosphonic acid
groups regulates calcium binding to the hydrogels and results in mineral
growth in SBF. The composition of the mineral was a carbonate apatite
similar to bone mineral. It was observed that the cross-linker structure
could strongly influence the extent of mineralization, 2b higher than
2a. The swelling degree increases with an increase of the cross-linker
concentration because of an increase in anionic charges and overcomes
the competition between the cross-linking density and the anionic
charges brought by the cross-linkers. The hydrogels obtained using
bisphosphonic acid-functionalized containing cross-linkers exhibit
a high Young’s modulus (up to 400 kPa) and can sustain up to
10.2 ± 0.1 MPa compressive stresses. The modulus and hence the
cross-link density of the hydrogels significantly increased upon mineralization
because of the additional BP–Ca2+ cross-links. For
instance, Young’s modulus E of the hydrogels prepared at 20
wt % cross-linker content increases from 104 ± 25 to 400 ±
30 kPa upon replacing water with 1 M CaCl2 solution, reflecting
the formation of a large number BP–Ca2+ bonds acting
as cross-linkers. Cyclic mechanical tests reveal self-recoverability
of the hydrogels at room temperature because of the reversible nature
of BP–Ca2+ bonds. These results imply that the bisphosphonic
acid functionalized cross-linkers are good candidates for use in tissue
engineering applications.

(Irgacure 2959), TMSBr, and all other reagents and solvents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (Taufkirchen, Germany) and used as
received without any further purification. Tetraethyl ethenylidene
bisphoshonate was synthesized from tetraethyl methylenebisphosphonate
as described by Degenhardt and Burdsall.47 Two BP-functionalized amines (BPA1 and BPA2) were synthesized as
reported by our group.39 Dichloromethane
(DCM) (Merck) was dried over activated molecular sieves.

Characterization
The chemical structures of BP-functionalized
diamines and cross-linkers were proved by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FTIR spectroscopies. NMR spectra were recorded
on a Varian Gemini 400 MHz spectrometer using deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3) or methanol (MeOD) as solvent and tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard. FTIR spectra were recorded on Thermo Scientific
Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Combi Flash Companion Teledyne ISCO Flash
Chromatography with C18 reverse-phase silica gel as a stationary phase
was used for purification of cross-linkers.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Monomers 1a and 1b
IEM (3.54 mmol, 0.5 mL) was
added dropwise to an ice-cold solution
of the synthesized diamine BPA1 or BPA2 (1.73 mmol) in 12 mL of dry
chloroform under a stream of nitrogen. The solution was stirred at
room temperature overnight under nitrogen and then extracted with
1 wt % HCl (2 × 10 mL) and brine (2 × 10 mL). The organic
layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated
under reduced pressure to leave the crude product. The crude product
was purified by reverse phase flash chromatography on C18, eluting
with water/methanol (40/60) followed by evaporation of solvents to
give monomers. BPA1 gives the monomer 1a, reported previously by us,38 whereas BPA2 gives a novel monomer 1b, obtained
as a viscous liquid in 58% yield. Solubilities of 1a and 1b are given
in Table S1.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Acid Monomers 2a and
2b
TMSBr (3.6 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of monomer
1a or 1b (0.6 mmol) in dry DCM (1.2 mL) in an ice bath under nitrogen.
The mixture was stirred for 5 h at 30 °C. The solvent and unreacted
TMSBr were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was stirred
with methanol (1.2 mL) for 15 min. The solution was concentrated under
reduced pressure to give pure
products. 1a gives monomer 2a, reported previously by us,38 and 1b gives novel monomer 2b, obtained as a
yellow waxy solid in 75% yield. Solubilities of 2a and 2b together
with 1a and 1b are given in Table S1.

Synthesis of Hydrogels
Bisphosphonic acid-functionalized
monomer (2a or 2b) and HEMA were dissolved in water at various concentrations
to form precursor solutions of hydrogels (Table 1). Irgacure 2959 (2 wt % of total monomer
weight) was added as a photoinitiator and the mixtures were polymerized
by exposure to UV light (365 nm) for 30 min in vials (for mineralization
studies) and syringes (for swelling and mechanical measurements).
For the gel fraction measurements, cylindrical gel specimens of about
9 mm in diameter and 6 mm in length were weighed (W1) and immersed in ethanol for 24 h and then in water
for 12 h to remove unreacted monomers. The swollen samples were lyophilized
and weighed again to obtain W2. The gel
fraction Wg that is the fraction of water-insoluble
polymer was calculated as 1  where C0 is the
initial monomer concentration (in wt %).

Swelling Studies
Swelling studies were performed by
immersing dry hydrogel samples into water and 1 M CaCl2 solutions at 37 °C. The gels were removed from the swelling
medium after 12 h, blotted on filter paper, and weighed. The SP was
calculated using the following equation48 2  where Ws and Wd refer to the weight of swollen and dry gel
samples, respectively. The average data obtained from triplicate measurements
were reported.

Mineralization of Hydrogels
SBF
was prepared as described
by Kokubo and Takadama.49 Buffer solution
(2 L, pH = 7.4) containing 142 mM Na+, 5 mM K+, 1.5 mM Mg2+, 2.5 mM Ca2+, 147.8 mM Cl–, 4.2 mM HCO3–, 1 mM HPO42–, and 0.5 mM SO42– was prepared in ultrapure water. This solution was then filter sterilized
(Millipore, sterivex filter unit, 0.22 μm) and stored at +4
°C. Hydrogel samples were soaked in SBF solution or ultrapure
water (control) and incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking (50
rpm) for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, during which buffer/water was
replaced with fresh one every day. The hydrogel samples were then
taken out of the solution, rinsed with ultrapure water twice, and
then freeze-dried to constant weight.

Characterization of Mineralized
Hydrogels
The morphology
of the hydrogels was analyzed via SEM (Zeiss Ultra Plus, Bruker).
The freeze-dried samples were coated with a thin layer of carbon,
and 10 kV acceleration voltage was used for imaging. An EDX detector
(Bruker XFlash 5010 123 eV) was used for elemental analysis of mineral
grown on hydrogels. The chemical compositions were analyzed by powder
XRD (D2 PHASER, Bruker, MA) measurements.

Determination of Ca2+ Content
The Ca2+ content was measured
by the procedure described in the literature.49 Mineralized hydrogel samples were first lyophilized
and then homogenized in 0.5 mL of 0.5 N HCl. The solution was shaken
at 175 rpm for 24 h, and mechanical force was applied. To achieve
complete dissolution of the hydrogels, the shaking was repeated overnight.
The Ca2+ concentration in the solution was measured by
spectrophotometric analysis using cresolphthalein complexone and Calcium
Reagent (Pointe Scientific). A standard curve was generated by using
standard solutions in the range of 0.01–0.2 mg/mL Ca2+ and the Ca2+ content was normalized to the dry weight
of the sample.

Mechanical Properties
Mechanical
properties of the
hydrogels in equilibrium with water or 1 M CaCl2 solution
were determined through uniaxial compression measurements on a Zwick
Roell test machine using a 500 N load cell in a thermostated room
at 23 ± 2 °C. Before the tests, a complete contact between
the gel specimen and the metal plate was provided by applying an initial
compressive force of 0.01 N. The tests were carried out at a constant
cross-head speed of 1.8 × 10–2 s–1. The stress was calculated as its nominal σnom and
true values σtrue (=λσnom),
which are the forces per cross-sectional area of the undeformed and
deformed gel samples, respectively, and λ is the compression
ratio. The strain is given by ε which is the change in the specimen
length with respect to its initial length, that is, ε = 1 –
λ. The compressive strength and strain at break of the hydrogels
were calculated from the maxima in σtrue versus ε
curves as detailed before.50 Young’s
modulus E of the hydrogels was calculated from the
slope of stress–strain curves between 5 and 15% compressions.
Cyclic compression tests were conducted at a constant cross-head speed
of 1.8 × 10–2 s–1 to a maximum
compression ratio, followed by retraction to zero force and a waiting
time of 5 min until the next cycle.
