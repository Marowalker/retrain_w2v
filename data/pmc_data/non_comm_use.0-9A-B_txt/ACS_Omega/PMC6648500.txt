Herein, we introduce a reusable Brønsted
acidic ionic liquid
gel (BAIL gel) obtained by treating 1-methyl-3-(4-sulfobutyl)-1H-imidazolium hydrogen sulfate with tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS). The grafting of the Brønsted acidic ionic liquid to the
surface of TEOS has increased the catalytic activity of the material
and also simplified catalyst recovery from the reaction mixture. This
reaction has a wide substrate scope, and the BAIL gel represents a
new catalyst for the synthesis of benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles, and
benzothiazoles. The method shows attractive characteristics such as
high yields, recyclable catalyst, and work-up simplicity. More importantly,
no additional additives or volatile organic solvent and inert atmosphere
are required for the reaction, and the BAIL gel has shown a great
promise for industrial applications. To the best of our knowledge,
the synthesis of benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles, and benzothiazoles
using a recyclable heterogeneous ionic liquid gel was not previously
reported in the literature.

Introduction
Task-specific ionic
liquids (TSILs) have attracted increasing interest
of chemists because of their unique physical and chemical properties.1−4 Among these, TSILs bearing SO3H groups with a hydrogen
sulfate counteranion have received special attention because of their
extremely strong acidic characters.5,6 These TSILs
have been used as green and useful catalysts in many organic reactions.6 However, the recovery process of ionic liquids
encounters a serious problem because of the high solubility of ionic
liquids in the reaction mixture.7,8 The immobilization of
TSILs onto silica and magnetic nanoparticles is an excellent pathway
for solving the separation process.9−12 However, tedious preparation
and leaching of their constituents into the liquid increase the cost
of the procedure and limit their application. Thus, ionic liquid gel
materials promise a new way to further utilize ionic liquids in catalysis
because of the simplicity of preparation, easy separation, and reuse
without a significant loss of activity.13 Owing to their attractive properties, the ionic liquid gels have
been prepared and applied as novel heterogeneous catalysts in organic
synthesis.14

Aryl-substituted benzoxazoles,
benzimidazoles, and benzothiazoles
are also a valuable class of heterocyclic compounds that have a wide
range of biological activities, including antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory,
antihypertensive, antihistaminic, and antimicrobial activities.15−25 Two well-known methods for the preparation of these compounds have
been developed: (i) metal-catalyzed direct alkylation of benzoxazoles,
benzimidazoles, and benzothiazoles through C–H activation followed
by C–C bond formation;26−30 (ii) condensation–aromatization of o-aminophenol, o-phenylenediamine, and o-aminothiophenols
with aldehydes using Brønsted or Lewis acid catalysts.31−38 Although the reported methods are satisfactory, synthesis of these
compounds remains challenging, with procedures suffering from low
yields, additional additives or volatile organic solvents, and expensive
and unrecyclable catalysts.

Attracted by the unique properties
of Brønsted acidic ionic
liquid gels (BAIL gels) and the valuable potential applications of
these heterogeneous ionic liquids in catalysis,14,39 we report herein the use of a Brønsted acidic ionic liquid
gel acting as an efficient and reusable heterogeneous catalyst for
the condensation–aromatization of o-aminophenols
and benzaldehydes. Interestingly, the expected products were obtained
in good to excellent yields, the BAIL gel was recovered easily by
filtration, and leaching was negligible. To the best of our knowledge,
a Brønsted acidic ionic liquid gel has never been used for the
reaction.

Results and Discussion
The Brønsted acidic ionic
liquid gel was prepared by following
the procedure discussed in the previous literature (Scheme 1)14,39 and was characterized by various techniques including scanning electron
microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The analysis
data were in agreement with those of the previous reports. The preparation
procedure and characterization of the Brønsted acidic ionic liquid
gel are presented in the Supporting Information. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the BAIL gel displayed high
thermal stability (>300 °C). EDS indicated the presence of
C,
O, N, Si, and S elements in the structure of the BAIL gel. The sulfur
concentration was found to be 71 000 ppm in the BAIL gel as
determined by ICP-OES analysis, corresponding to a BAIL loading of
1.10 mmol g–1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the BAIL Gel
Initially, we screened a range
of catalysts for the synthesis of
benzoxazole under a solvent-free condition. Traditional catalysts
including Brønsted and Lewis acids showed low catalytic activities
(Table 1, entries 1–13).
Interestingly, the use of the BAIL gel afforded a significant rate
increase with 98% yield of 2-phenylbenzoxazole at 130 °C for
5 h (Table 1, entry
16). The reaction could proceed to 87% yield of the desired product
using the BAIL (Table 1, entry 14). Next, the optimal conditions for the synthesis of benzoxazole
were investigated. No product was obtained for the reaction carried
out at room temperature, and the reaction hardly proceeded at the
temperature range below 100 °C. Although a higher temperature
(up to 130 °C) was used, 98% yield of the desired product was
achieved for 5 h in the presence of a catalytic amount (1 mol %) of
the BAIL gel. All attempts to reduce the amount of the BAIL gel led
to significant drops in the reaction yield.

b Isolated yield.

The scope of the reactants was then investigated using a wide range
of aromatic aldehydes for the synthesis of benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles,
and benzothiazoles. The reaction of substituted aromatic aldehydes
such as electron-donating (p-Me, p-OMe, and p-tbu) and electron-withdrawing
(p-NO2) substituents afforded the expected
products in good to excellent yields (Table 2, entries 2–4 and 7). Halo substituents
on the benzaldehyde ring (p-F, p-Cl) were also reactive, providing the desired products in 85 and
88% yields for 5.5 h (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). The reaction of pyridine-4-carbaldehyde
resulted in 87% yield of the corresponding product for 6 h (Table 2, entry 8). Next,
these conditions were then applied to o-aminophenol
derivatives. The reactions were found to be successful for all o-aminophenol derivatives. The use of 2-amino-4-methylphenol
and 2-amino-4-chlorophenol proceeded more smoothly with aromatic aldehydes,
with 86–94% isolated yields (Table 2, entries 9–18). However, 2-amino-4-nitrophenol
showed lower reactivity than the other substrates, with the expected
products in only 75–79% yields for prolonged reaction times
(Table 2, entries 19–22).
To demonstrate the utility of the current method, 2-arylbenzithiazole
and 2-arylbenzimidazole derivatives were synthesized under optimal
conditions. We observed that the reaction of o-aminothiophenol
and o-phenylenediamine with benzaldehydes provided
the corresponding products in high yields (Table 2, entries 23–28).

a Reaction conditions:
substrate (1.0
mmol), aldehyde (1.0 mmol), BAIL gel (0.01 mmol), at 130 °C.

b Isolated yield.

The proposed reaction mechanism
was confirmed by mass spectrometry
(MS) (Scheme 2). To
explore the mechanism on the BAIL gel catalyst, the condensation of o-aminophenol with benzaldehyde was carried out for only
1 h under optimal conditions. We found that 2-(benzylideneamino)phenol
(m/z 197) was obtained as a major
precursor. As asserted in the previous literature and our experiments,
the BAIL gel plays a vital role in the reaction mechanism. The first
interaction would be presumably the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen
from benzaldehyde by −SO3H active sites on the catalyst
surface. The intermediate A was formed through the reaction of activated
aldehyde with the amino group on the substrate, which was followed
by dehydration to deliver the imine B. Next, the XH group in the intermediate
B attacked the imine groups to generate the intermediate C. The intermediate
C then subsequently underwent aromatization by oxidation with oxygen
in air under the reaction conditions to form the desired product.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism
The comparison of our work with the previous literature
is reported
in Table 3. Although
various catalysts displayed high activities, these catalysts could
not be effectively recycled (Table 3, entries 1–5). The reaction of 2-aminophenol
and benzaldehyde in the presence of the BAIL gel afforded the desired
product in an excellent yield at 130 °C for 5 h under the solvent-free
condition, and the catalyst could be recovered and reused without
a significant loss in activity (Table 3, entry 6). The previous studies reported that the
same reaction also afforded the target products in good yields at
a lower temperature and shorter reaction time, but those methods involved
the use of a volatile organic solvent and higher loading of the catalyst.

The recycling of the BAIL gel was
tested in the reaction of 2-aminophenol
and benzaldehyde under optimized conditions. After completion of the
reaction (monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) or gas chromatography
(GC)), the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and the BAIL gel
was separated by filtration. The recovered catalyst was washed with
hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol; dried in vacuum; and reused for
the next cycle. Experimental results displayed that the BAIL gel catalyst
could be recovered and reused many times without a significant loss
in catalytic activity. Indeed, the reaction still afforded 89% yield
of the desired product even after five consecutive runs (Figure 1). The FT-IR spectrum
of the recovered catalyst showed no considerable change in structure
(Figure 2). The leaching
of the BAIL was determined by ICP-OES, and the result indicated that
the amount of sulfur in ethyl acetate was less than 1 ppm, suggesting
a little leaching of the BAIL from the catalyst during the reaction.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed a green and efficient heterogeneous
Brønsted acidic ionic liquid gel for the synthesis of benzoxazoles,
benzimidazoles, and benzothiazoles under the solvent-free condition
for the first time. High yields of desired products were achieved
in the presence of a catalytic amount of the BAIL gel (1 mol %). Moreover,
the BAIL gel catalyst could be easily recovered and reused without
any significant loss of catalytic activity after five runs. This association
between Brønsted acidic ionic liquid and tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) offers a new method for preparation of highly attractive heterogeneous
catalysts with attractive characteristics such as high yields, work-up
simplicity, and negligible ionic liquid leaching into the organic
product phase. Furthermore, the synthesis of heteroaryl-substituted
compounds using an environmentally benign acidic ionic liquid gel
catalyst is an ongoing project.

Experimental Section
General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Benzoxazoles
2-Aminophenol
(0.119 g, 1 mmol), benzaldehyde (0.106 g, 1 mmol),
and a BAIL gel (0.010 g, 1.0 mol % of BAIL) were added into a 5 mL
vessel. The reaction mixture was then stirred under a solvent-free
condition at 130 °C for 5 h. After completion of the reaction
(monitored by TLC or GC), the mixture was dissolved in 10 mL of ethyl
acetate, and the BAIL gel catalyst was separated by centrifugation.
The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and dried
in vacuum to obtain the crude product. The crude product was purified
by silica gel column chromatography using acetone/petroleum ether
(1:19) to afford the pure product. The purified product was confirmed
by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MS. For the recycling
studies, the catalyst was washed with hexane (2 × 3 mL), ethyl
acetate (2 × 3 mL), and ethanol (2 mL), dried in vacuum to remove
all of the volatile components, and then reused in the next run.
