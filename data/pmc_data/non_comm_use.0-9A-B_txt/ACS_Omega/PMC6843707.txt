Antarctic krill (Euphausia
superba) is one of the important bioresources in Antarctic
waters, containing
many bioactives (e.g., astaxanthin), which have a highly potential
value for commercial exploitation. In this study, the effects of processing
methods on the content, structural isomers, and composition of astaxanthins
(free astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters) were studied. Three drying
methods, comprising freeze-drying, microwave drying, and hot-air drying,
were used. Free astaxanthin (Ast), astaxanthin monoesters (AM), and
astaxanthin diesters (AD) in boiled krill (control) and dried krill
were extracted and analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry
with ultraviolet detection. After the three processes, total astaxanthin
loss ranged from 8.6 to 64.9%, and the AM and AD contents ranged from
78.3 to 16.6 and 168.7 to 90.5 μg/g, respectively. Compared
to other kinds of astaxanthin esters, astaxanthin esters, which linked
to eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, as well as the
Ast, were more easily degraded, and AM was more susceptible to degradation
than AD. All-E-astaxanthin easily transformed to
the 13Z-astaxanthin than to the 9Z-astaxanthin during the drying process, but the proportions of optical
isomers changed due to drying by no more than 5%. The results suggested
that freeze-drying, low-power microwave drying (≤1 kW), and
low-temperature hot-air drying (≤60 °C) are optimal drying
methods for ensuring the quality of krill products.

1 Introduction
With tremendous biomass,
Antarctic krill (Euphausia
superba) constitutes the largest biological population
of a single species in Antarctic waters.1 Many unsaturated fatty acids, proteins, and bioactive compounds,
such as astaxanthin and chitin, can be extracted from krill.2 Some studies have reported that dietary supplements
containing krill can regulate intestinal microbiota and relieve hyperlipidaemia
to improve atherosclerosis.3,4 In another study, the
presence of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),
and astaxanthin in krill oil improved the cognitive ability and alleviated
depression in rats.5 A valuable health
supplement, krill oil, has gained popularity worldwide.6

As the main type of natural xanthophyll
in krill, astaxanthin has
strong antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities.7−9 Astaxanthin could become a potential remedy for the treatment of
diabetic nephropathy.10 Animal experiments
have shown that astaxanthin can prevent liver damage caused by ageing,11 inhibit neuronal apoptosis, and enhance cognitive
function.12 Astaxanthin exists in three
forms in nature: free astaxanthin (Ast), astaxanthin monoesters (AM),
and astaxanthin diesters (AD) (Figure 1). Krill contains approximately 30–40 mg/kg
of astaxanthin, with 25–35% of AM, 55–64% of AD, and
<5% of Ast.13 The fatty acids C14:0,
C16:0, C16:1, C18:1, C20:0, C20:5, and C22:6 are present in AM and
AD.14 Herein, astaxanthin isomers with
different chiralities at C3,3′ are referred to as R/S (optical) isomers and consist of two enantiomers
(3S,3′S/3R,3′R) and a meso form (3S,3′R).15 Maoka
et al. ascertained 3R,3′R to be the most abundant isomer (62–71%)
in krill.16 Isomers with different configurations
of double bonds are referred to as cis/trans isomers, and all-trans (all-E)-astaxanthin, 13-cistrine (13Z)-astaxanthin, and 9-cistrine (9Z)-astaxanthin are the most
common geometric isomers.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of (1) Astaxanthin, (2)
astaxanthin monoesters,
and (3) astaxanthin diesters.

Krill processing involves boiling, drying, grinding, and refining.
In most cases, the contents of astaxanthin vary markedly during these
processes due to a large number of double bonds in its structure.17 The drying method used to process krill plays
an important role in determining the content of astaxanthin. Thus,
it is critical to clarify how xanthophyll carotenoid such as astaxanthin
degrades during different drying methods. Little is known about how
the manufacturing process affects astaxanthin. It was reported that
thermal treatment (deactivation of lipases and proteases at 92–98
°C for 10 min) resulted in an approximately 17% decrease in the
amount of astaxanthin in the product.18 The study about the stability of astaxanthin from the lactic acid
fermented shrimp byproduct had been reported.19 A previous study of the isomerization of Ast dissolved in organic
solvents reported that higher temperatures could promote isomerization.20 Because astaxanthin isomers vary in their chemical
and biological properties and display different antioxidant capacities,21,22 understanding how the drying process affects the formation of isomers
is important for generating an effective health supplement. Numerous
studies have assessed the effects of thermal processing and drying
on the contents of astaxanthin in Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and microalga (Haematococcus
pluvialis),23−25 but few studies have focused
on the effects of drying method on the structure and composition of
astaxanthins in krill.

In this study, the influence of drying
methods (freeze-drying,
microwave drying, and hot-air drying) on the content and structural
isomers of astaxanthin in Antarctic krill was studied. Additionally
the composition and stability of astaxanthin esters were investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Composition of Astaxanthin
Esters in the Absence
of Drying
Astaxanthin esters in boiled krill that did not
undergo drying were separated using a C30 column. The molecular
species of astaxanthin were identified by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS), and the detailed data are shown in Table 1. A total of 28 astaxanthin derivatives were
identified in this experiment: Ast, nine AM, and 18 AD. The retention
time of Ast was 6.02 min, whereas those of AMs and ADs were 10–16
and 17–26 min, respectively.

[M + H-FA]+: the mass-to-charge ratio of astaxanthin ester
fragment ions, which were lost by the formation of any of the fatty
acid molecules.

Due to the
lack of some astaxanthin ester standards, we used the
standards of Asta-C16:0 and Asta-C16:0/C16:0 for quantitative analysis,
which relied on accurate masses and characteristic ions. Figure 2 shows the second-order
ion mass spectra of Ast, Asta-C16:0, and Asta-C16:0/C16:0 extracted
from krill. The molecular ion peak [M + H]+ of astaxanthin
is at 597.39430, and the characteristic fragment ion at m/z 579.38586 is the result of parent molecules losing
water. In addition, m/z 147.1 and m/z 173.125 are
both characteristic ions. The qualitative definition of AM is mainly
based on the exact molecular mass of the compound and the characteristic
ions of astaxanthin. The qualitative definition of AD is also based
on characteristic ion fragments of [M + H-FA]+.26 For AD, the same chemical formula may occur
in combination with different fatty acids. Therefore, the type of
AD cannot be determined from the precise molecular weight and characteristic
ions of astaxanthin. However, the characteristic ions of [M + H-FA]+ can be used to reliably distinguish astaxanthin esters. As
shown in the spectrum of Asta-C16:0/C16:0 in Figure 2, the molecular ion peak at 1073.85732, the
characteristic ions of astaxanthin, and [M + H-FA]+ 817.60419
are clearly visible.

Figure 2 Secondary mass spectra of free astaxanthin, Asta-C16:0,
and Asta-C16:0/C16:0
extracted from Antarctic krill.

The peak area of Asta-C16:0 was tenfold greater than that of Asta-C16:0/C16:0,
which showed that the response values of AM and AD were different.
Therefore, analysis of the contents of astaxanthin esters was carried
out using a quantitative method according to the molar content of
the two standards and the corresponding peak area. In the control
sample, diesterified astaxanthin was the major component, with a relative
percentage of 66.9%, and monosterified astaxanthin accounted for a
large percentage (30.4%). The most abundant astaxanthins in krill
corresponded to Asta-C16:0/C18:1 (13.2%), followed by Asta-C14:0/C16:0
(9.0%), and Asta-C14:0/C14:0 (8.2%), with Asta-C16:0 (7.0%), Asta-C16:0 (7.1%), and Asta-C16:0/C16:0
(6.2%) being the most representative astaxanthin esters (Table 1). Notably, among
AD, seven species contained EPA or DHA, and Asta-C20:5/Asta-C22:6
was present.

The number, relative proportion, and composition
of the astaxanthin
molecular species obtained in the present work differ slightly from
those reported in other studies.14,27 In this study,
detected astaxanthins comprised Ast (2.6%), AM (30.4%), and AD (66.9%),
consistent with Yamaguchi et al.13 We and
Takaichi et al.27 both detected high concentrations
of Asta-C18:4, which Grynbaum et al.14 and
Xie et al.29 did not observe. The types
of algae consumed by Antarctic krill vary geographically and temporally.
In the winter, ice algae, which contain Asta-C18:4, can provide krill
adequate food. Consumption of these algae might explain the presence
of Asta-C18:4 in krill.30 Another reason
for our finding of Asta-C18:4 in krill might be the higher mass resolution
and mass accuracy instrument in this study than in previous studies,
allowing more astaxanthin esters to be detected. In addition, in the
present study, Asta-C18:0 and Asta-C20:1 were not detected, which
are inconsistent with the results of Grynbaum et al.14 This difference might be due to seasonal differences between
studies or the destruction of several astaxanthins in the present
study during the short boil time.

2.2 Effect
of Drying Method on Total Astaxanthin
Content
To eliminate the effects of moisture on the measurement
results, we reduced the moisture content of all samples as much as
possible. In this experiment, the total astaxanthin content in boiled
krill (control samples) was 125 μg/g (dry weight). As shown
in Figure 3, the astaxanthin
amount in the samples varied with the processing method. Compared
with the drying temperatures and powers, the selected drying methods,
such as freeze-drying, hot-air drying, and microwave drying, had a
stronger influence on astaxanthin. Among the three drying methods,
freeze-drying had the least effect on astaxanthin recovery. After
freeze-drying, the content of astaxanthin decreased to 113 μg/g
(dry weight).Under hot-air drying, the amount of astaxanthin gradually
decreased as drying temperature increased, with astaxanthin content
decreasing from 116 to 103 μg/g (dry weight) as drying temperature
increased from 40 to 60 °C. There was a significant decrease
in astaxanthin content as the drying temperature exceeded 60 °C,
and more than 60% of astaxanthin was lost when the temperature reached
100 °C, demonstrating that the drying conditions had a strong
influence on astaxanthin content. A similar pattern was observed under
microwave drying, with astaxanthin content decreasing with increasing
microwave power. The percent degradation of astaxanthin at different
powers increased from 10.6% (at a power of 1 kW) to 58.0% (at a power
of 5 kW).

The different drying methods had different effects
on the astaxanthin
in Antarctic krill. Freeze-drying is a common method used in the dry
heating of labile compounds. We found that the samples were freeze-dried
for 12 h at −50 °C lost 8% of their astaxanthin content.
Miao et al. reported that H. pluvialis lost only 5% of its astaxanthin during storage at −18 °C
for 76 weeks.31 The thick cell walls of H. pluvialis isolate astaxanthin from oxygen, thus
protecting it from damage due to external conditions. Accordingly,
the loss of astaxanthin in freeze-dried krill in this study was higher
than that of H. pluvialis in Yang’s
experiment. A small amount of astaxanthin loss at low temperatures
might also be attributed to astaxanthin esters account for 95% of
the total content in H. pluvialis(32) and krill.

In addition to freeze-drying,
low-temperature (≤60 °C)
drying and low-power (1 kW) drying were suitable for obtaining high
astaxanthin contents. However, at higher temperatures or power, the
loss of astaxanthin increased substantially. Sun et al. reported that
hot-air drying at 60 °C combined with freeze-drying yielded krill
powder of better quality, but astaxanthin content decreased rapidly
above 60 °C.22 The results of the
current study suggest that 60 °C is the optimum temperature for
hot-air drying. Astaxanthin, β-carotene, and
α-carotene belong to the carotenoid family
and show similar responses in thermal treatment experiments due to
their similar chemical structures. The total loss of α-carotene
and β-carotene caused by microwaving at 3 kW was lower than
that under hot-air drying.33 Furthermore,
compared to conventional heating, microwave heating at 300 W was found
to be less harmful to anthocyanins and other antioxidants.34 In the present study, microwave drying (>1
kW)
had milder effects than did hot-air drying (≥60 °C), with
retaining more astaxanthin under microwave drying.

2.3 Effect of Drying Method on the Composition
of Astaxanthins
In this study, derivatives of astaxanthin
detected in the extracts of dried krill were present in the boiled
krill, and the drying process did not produce new astaxanthin esters.
The evolution of the relative contents of 17 types of derivatives
of astaxanthin during drying (Figure 4) suggests that the degradation of astaxanthin esters
during hot-air and microwave drying was more extensive than that of
during boiling. In the drying process, the content of each astaxanthin
ester diminished by 3 to 90%. The loss rate was the highest for Ast,
and the esterified forms were more stable than the free form, as the
proportion of astaxanthin esters to total astaxanthin increased after
drying. The stability of astaxanthin linked to unsaturated fatty acids
was lower than that of other astaxanthin esters except in the case
of Asta-C18:3 and Asta-C18:4.

Figure 4 Degradation of 17 Astaxanthin losses (%) in
dried krill. (A) Freeze-drying,
(B) hot-air drying, and (C) microwave drying.

Under freeze-drying, the greatest losses were more than 20%, as
shown by Ast and AM connected to EPA and DHA. In contrast, Asta-C14:0/C14:0
and Asta-C14:0/C16:0 were the most stable and remained almost undecomposed.
The loss of total astaxanthin was 8.5%, whereas the loss of most AM-
and AD-containing unsaturated fatty acids was even greater.

During hot-air drying, the detected content of astaxanthins decreased
with increasing drying temperature (Figure 4). The percentage loss of Ast was higher
than that of other astaxanthins and approached 100% at a drying temperature
of 100 °C. In a range of 40 to 60 °C, the loss of astaxanthins
was moderate. The astaxanthins were greatly damaged at temperatures
above 60 °C. Under hot-air drying, Asta-C18:3 and Asta-C18:4
were more stable than the other AM. When the drying temperature reached
100 °C, most AM was degraded by approximately 90%, such as Asta-C16:0,
Asta-C20:5, and Asta-C22:6, but Asta-C18:3 and Asta-C18:4 were degraded
by only approximately 40%. For AD, the percent loss of Asta-C16:0/C20:5
was lower than that of Asta-C18:1/C18:1 at temperatures below 60 °C,
but the pattern was reversed at higher temperatures, as was observed
for Asta-C14:0/C20:5, Asta-C18:1/C20:5, and Asta-C20:5/C22:6. This
behavior was attributed to the highly unsaturated nature of fatty
acids linked to astaxanthin, which makes them more susceptible to
degradation than less unsaturated lipids at higher temperatures.

The degradation of astaxanthins by microwave increased with increasing
power at an approximately constant rate. The maximum loss of Ast is
about 83%, the loss of Asta-C20:5 is about 77%, and the losses of
other astaxanthins are lower than this value. However, under hot-air
drying conditions, the maximum loss of some astaxanthins exceeded
90%. Compared with the trend of astaxanthin loss with increasing temperature
under hot-air drying, that under microwave drying was less variable.

In this study, the loss of Ast during the drying processes was
much higher than that of AM or AD (Figure 4). Similarly, compared with Ast in H. pluvialis, the stability of astaxanthin esters
was higher.24 This phenomenon may be due
to the substitution of the hydroxyl groups at both ends of astaxanthin
with fatty acids, increasing ester stability. For astaxanthin esters,
high-efficiency microwave drying was less harmful to astaxanthin esters
than high-temperature hot-air drying, which may be related to the
drying time. Research on the storage of dehydrated pumpkin revealed
that the degradation of carotenoids was related to storage time, with
the loss of carotenoids increasing with storage time.35 In the present study, the microwave drying time was shorter
than the hot-air drying time such that some astaxanthin esters might
have been destroyed in the long-term, high-temperature aerobic environment.

The content of astaxanthin in krill varied with the drying method.
In general, freeze-drying was the method least destructive to astaxanthins,
followed by microwave drying and then hot-air drying. As shown in Figure 4, the esterified
forms of astaxanthin had higher stability, and most of the AD was
more stable than AM during drying. Similarly, in a study of the effect
of heat treatment on astaxanthin esters in P. vannamei, Yang et al. found that AD was more stable than AM.23 This phenomenon may be due to the fact that both ends of
AD are linked to fatty acids and have stable chemical properties.
In the present study, we found that compared to other AM, four esters,
Asta-C16:0, Asta-C18:1, Asta-C20:5, and Asta-C22:6, were less thermally
stable. In addition, Yang et al. reported higher loss rates of Asta-C20:5
and Asta-C22:6 than that of Asta-C18:0 or Asta-C18:2, and the loss
rates of other type of AM were not reported.23

2.4 Effect of Drying Method on Optical Isomers
Astaxanthin has three all-E-astaxanthin optical
isomers, which have different compositions.36 The boiled krill contained 12% 3S,3′S, 9% 3S,3′R, and
79% 3R,3′R (Figure 3). Freeze-drying was the mildest
of the drying methods tested, and it had no effect on the optical
isomer composition of astaxanthin (p > 0.05).
Hot-air
drying temperatures of 40–60 °C did not significantly
affect the stereostructure of astaxanthin; however, when the temperature
increased from 60 to 100 °C, the proportion of 3S,3′R increased by 4.8% and that of 3R,3′R decreased by 3.4% (p < 0.01). Microwave drying had a similar effect. When
the power increased from 1 to 5 kW, the proportions of 3R,3′R and 3S,3′S decreased slightly and the proportion of 3S,3′R increased by 2.3% (p < 0.05). Thus, the composition of the optical isomers of astaxanthin
was not affected by freeze-drying but was significantly affected by
both hot-air and microwave drying.

The composition of optical
isomers differs among different organisms. For example, 3S,3′S accounts for a large proportion of the
isomers in H. pluvialis, whereas 3R,3′R is more abundant than 3S,3′S in Antarctic krill.37,38 In the current study, hot-air drying decreased the 3S,3′S ratio and increased the 3S,3′R ratio. Liu et al.20 conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments and found that
the antioxidation and antiageing activities of different stereoisomers
of astaxanthin decreased in the order 3S,3′S > 3R,3′R >
synthetic
astaxanthin (3S,3′S/3S,3′R/3R,3′R = 1:2:1). Additionally, 3S,3′S and 3R,3′R both
showed strong inhibition in an erythrocyte hemolysis test, whereas
synthetic astaxanthin did not show the same response.39

These three configurations of astaxanthin have been
shown to promote
lymphocyte proliferation in mice, with 3S,3′S having the strongest effects.40 In the present study, under hot-air and microwave drying, the 3S,3′R ratio gradually increased
with increasing temperature and power, which may have influenced the
activity of astaxanthin. Furthermore, freeze-drying was the only method
that did not affect the optical isomers, although subsequent studies
are needed to confirm this finding.

2.5 Effect
of Drying Method on Geometrical Isomers
The industrial process
used to produce krill powder involves preboiling
the krill at a high temperature, which produces 9Z- and 13Z-astaxanthin.22 In this study, the effect of drying method on the stability of astaxanthin
was evaluated by comparing the isomerized astaxanthin before and after
drying. The contents of all-E-, 9Z-, and 13Z-astaxanthin, their percentage changes,
and their relative proportions are summarized in Table 2.

During freeze-drying, the contents of all-E-,
13Z-, and 9Z-geometrical isomers
of astaxanthin decreased by an average of 10, 3.60, and 6.63%, respectively.
However, high temperature and microwave power strongly affected the
structure of astaxanthin. The loss of all-E-astaxanthin
was no more than 23.19% at drying temperatures of 40–60 °C
and reached 15.32% at 1 kW. However, the contents of all-E-astaxanthin decreased 65 and 54% when the temperature reached 100
°C and microwave power reached 5 kW. At drying temperatures of
40–60 °C, the percentage of 13Z-astaxanthin
increased from 13 to 15%, whereas that of 9Z-astaxanthin
did not change. As the temperature increased from 60 to 100 °C,
the percentage of all-E- decreased from 73 to 62%,
whereas that of 13Z-astaxanthin increased by 3% and
that of 9Z-astaxanthin increased by 8%. As microwave
power increased from 1 to 5 kW, the content of all-E-astaxanthin decreased from 15 to 53%. However, at 1 kW, the percentage
of 13Z-astaxanthin increased to 4.66%, and that of
9Z- astaxanthin decreased to 2.34%, indicating that
the all-E-astaxanthin was readily transformed to
13Z-astaxanthin.Under microwave
drying, the proportions of all-E- and 13Z-astaxanthin changed greatly, while the percentage of 9Z-astaxanthin increased by only 3%. The results revealed that all drying
processes led to the loss of E/Z isomers and that higher temperature or microwave power exacerbated
this process. Freeze-drying caused slight all-E-astaxanthin,
whereas hot-air (≥60 °C) and microwave drying (>1 kW)
strongly influenced the isomerization of astaxanthin. The production
of the 13Z-astaxanthin was greater than that of the
9Z-astaxanthin under the drying process.

Astaxanthin
in krill usually consists of all-E-astaxanthin, but
when exposed to light, heat, organic solvents,
acids, and bases, the structure is easily isomerized to form a mixture
of Z and E isomers.21 Both 13Z- and 9Z-astaxanthin
were generated during the drying process, and the isomerism of astaxanthin
increased as the drying temperature and microwave power increased.
Yang et al. found thermal processing apparently promoted the isomerization
of astaxanthin.23 As shown in Figure 3, the proportion
of all-E-astaxanthin gradually decreased under drying,
indicating that some astaxanthin was isomerized during the drying
process, and the production of 13Z- was greater than
that of 9Z-astaxanthin. In addition, we found that
low drying temperatures (≤60 °C) could reduce all-E-astaxanthin. It was reported previously that AM linked
to palmitic acid is more readily transformed to 13Z-astaxanthin than Ast.41 Thus, in the
present study, the higher content of 13Z-astaxanthin
than that of 9Z-astaxanthin in dried krill was possibly
due to the abundance of AM. Zhao et al. reported that Ast was preferentially
transformed to 13Z-astaxanthin rather than 9Z-astaxanthin under microwave treatment.42 We obtained similar results (Table 2). Furthermore, we found that microwave power
below 1 kW reduced the isomerization phenomenon and helped preserve
all-E-astaxanthinin krill dry products. In rat microsomes,
the antioxidant capacities of these isomers decreased in the order
9Z- > 13Z- > all-E-astaxanthin.21 Further studies are needed
to determine the effect of astaxanthin structural changes on biological
activity.

In the study, HPLC was used to measure the total content
of astaxanthin
in the lipid extracts of krill samples. The drying mode (freeze-drying,
hot-air drying, or microwave drying) and conditions (temperature or
microwave power) affected total astaxanthin content and isomer composition.
The astaxanthin esters were identified by liquid chromatography coupled
with mass spectrometry, and the main astaxanthin esters in the dried
krill samples were quantitatively analyzed. Krill (not dried) contained
a total of 28 types of astaxanthin derivatives. Ast had the lowest
stability regardless of the drying process. The stability of most
AD was higher than that of AM, and the astaxanthin esters linked to
EPA and DHA were more easily destroyed. As drying temperature or microwave
power increased, astaxanthin content gradually decreased. The drying
conditions of 60 °C and 1 kW were optimal as they minimized astaxanthin
degradation and ensured maximum drying efficiency. High-power microwave
drying (≥1 kW) and high-temperature drying (≥60 °C)
increased the isomerization of astaxanthin. These results show that
freeze-drying, low-power microwave drying (1 kW), and low-temperature
hot-air drying (≤60 °C) are conducive to the production
of Antarctic krill powder with high astaxanthin content.

3 Conclusions
The effects of different drying methods
on astaxanthin in Antarctic
krill were studied. HPLC was used to measure the total content of
astaxanthin in the lipid extracts of krill samples. The drying mode
(freeze-drying, hot-air drying, or microwave drying) and conditions
(temperature or microwave power) affected total astaxanthin content
and isomer composition. The astaxanthin esters were identified by
liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and the main
astaxanthin esters in the dried krill samples were quantitatively
analyzed. Krill (not dried) contained a total of 28 types of astaxanthin
derivatives. Ast had the lowest stability regardless of the drying
process. The stability of most AD was higher than that of AM, and
the astaxanthin esters linked to EPA and DHA were more easily destroyed.
As drying temperature or microwave power increased, astaxanthin content
gradually decreased. The drying conditions of 60 °C and 1 kW
were optimal as they minimized astaxanthin degradation and ensured
maximum drying efficiency. High-power microwave drying (>1 kW)
and
high-temperature drying (>60 °C) increased the isomerization
of astaxanthin. These results show that freeze-drying, low-power microwave
drying (1 kW), and low-temperature hot-air drying (≤60 °C)
are conducive to the production of Antarctic krill powder with high
astaxanthin content.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Antarctic krill were acquired
from the Marine Fisheries Group Co., Ltd. (Dalian, P.R. China) and
stored at −80 °C. The all-E-astaxanthin
standard with a purity of 95.8 ± 0.5% was purchased from Dr.
Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany). The standard products for 13Z-astaxanthin, 9Z-astaxanthin, Asta-C16:0,
and Asta-C16:0/C16:0 were purchased from Swiss Carotenature (Münsingen,
Switzerland). Methanol, tert-butyl methyl ether,
isopropanol, and acetonitrile were of HPLC grade (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany). Acetone was of HPLC grade (Duksan, Korea). ammonium formate
was obtained from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Anhydrous magnesium
sulfate and sodium hydroxide were all of high purity (GuoYao, Shanghai,
China).

4.2 Antarctic Krill Sample Preparation
Initially, 7 kg of frozen krill were thawed at room temperature (18
°C). The thawed samples were then boiled in 4 L of water for
3–5 min and then cooled to room temperature. The boiled krill
samples were centrifuged, dehydrated, uniformly mixed, and then divided
into 13 portions. Five portions were subjected to microwave drying,
six portions were subjected to hot-air drying, one portion were subjected
to freeze-drying, and the last portion was directly placed in a freezer
at −80 °C without any treatment. Microwave drying consisted
of five powers (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 kW), and the speed of the conveyor
was adjusted to make the final moisture content of the sample consistent
between treatments. To prepare the hot-air-dried samples, approximately
500 g of krill was uniformly tiled on glass Petri dishes and placed
in a preheated oven. Drying was carried out at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80,
and 100 °C. The moisture content of the samples was measured
every 30 min until it became constant. For freeze-drying, a portion
of the krill was plated on a Petri dish and dried in a vacuum freeze-dryer
at a temperature of −55 °C for 12 h. All samples were
stored at −80 °C prior to treatment.

4.3 Extraction of Astaxanthin
All samples
were individually comminuted using acetone as a solvent to extract
astaxanthin, following a previously reported method with slight modification.43 Each undried sample was mixed with anhydrous
magnesium sulfate and acetone at a ratio of 1:2:5 (w/w/v), and each
dried sample was directly combined with five volumes of acetone. The
mixture was extracted by ultrasound treatment using the ultrasonic
cleaner (Kunshan, China) at 40 kHz for 15 min. The ultrasonic extraction
dispersed the particles uniformly in the extract, thus significantly
improving the extraction efficiency.44 The
mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min, and the above extraction
steps were repeated; finally, the supernatants were combined. To ensure
that the astaxanthin was not destroyed, the temperature was controlled
at 0–4 °C. Each supernatant was mixed and placed in a
brown glass bottle, sealed with nitrogen, and stored in a freezer
at −20 °C.

4.4 Analysis of Astaxanthin
Composition
Astaxanthin was identified by HPLC quadruple/high-resolution
MS (HRMS)
(LC-Q Exactive Orbitrap MS). A mixture of acetone and krill extract
was diluted at 1:10 (v/v) and analyzed using a 0.25 μm filtration
membrane. A C30-reversed phase column (250 × 2.1 mm,
1.9 μm) was used under the following conditions: eluent A: 90%
isopropyl alcohol acetonitrile solution with 10 mM ammonium formate
and 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B: 60% acetonitrile aqueous solution
with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. The elution velocity,
column temperature, and injection volume were 0.3 mL/min, 45 °C,
and 2 μL, respectively. The linear gradient elution condition
was as follows: B increased from 40 to 65% in 0 to 3 min; B increased
from 65 to 75% in 3–8 min; B increased from 75 to 80% in 8–12
min; B increased from 80 to 85% in 12–35 min; B remained at
85% for 35–40 min; B decreased from 85 to 40% at 41 min. Then,
the system was maintained for 10 min to stabilize the column.

The analysis was carried out using the HPLC-HRMS (Thermo Scientific,
USA) technology, and the source temperature was set at 320 °C
in the positive ion mode. The resolution of the full-scan mode was
set as 70000 full width at half-maximum (FWHM). The C-trap maximum
capacity (automatic gain control (AGC) target) was 3 × 106. The C-trap maximum injection time was 100 ms. The resolution
of MS/MS was set as 17500 FWHM. The maximum capacity of the C-trap
(AGC target) was 1 × 105. The maximum injection time
of the C-trap was 50 ms. The collision energy values were 10 and 18
eV.

4.5 Determination of Total Astaxanthin Content
The astaxanthins were transformed into Ast after hydrolysis for
quantification. The method described by Wade et al.45 was used to study the decomposition of astaxanthin esters
in Antarctic krill. Chromatographic conditions in the method described
by Sun et al. were used.46 The analysis
was carried out on an HPLC system (Agilent, USA) with a UV detector
using methanol and methyl tert-butyl ether at a flow
rate of 1.0 mL/min, an injection volume of 20 mL, and a column temperature
of 30 °C. The total astaxanthin content was calculated quantitatively
using Sun’s correction factor.46

4.6 Analysis of Optical Isomers
The composition
of the optical isomers of astaxanthin was measured by HPLC using the
above sample solution. The optical isomers of astaxanthin were separated
using a Chiralpak IC column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm).25 Methyl tert-butyl ether/methanol
(50:50, v/v) as the mobile phase, isocratic elution, an elution flow
rate of 1 mL/min, a column temperature of 25 °C, and an injection
volume of 20 μL were used as the chromatographic conditions.

4.7 Analysis of Geometrical Isomers
Using
the above solution, the contents of the isomers in each sample were
determined following the method of Yang et al.47 The carotenoid extracts were analyzed by an HPLC system
equipped with a UV detector. Separation was performed on a C30 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) under the following conditions:
mobile phase A: methanol solution, mobile phase B: methyl tert-butyl ether, mobile phase C: 1% phosphoric acid solution,
and a gradient elution flow rate of 1 mL/min.

4.8 Data
Analysis
All data are expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation, and all statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSS statistics package software (version
16.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Differences were considered to be statistically
significant at p < 0.05.
