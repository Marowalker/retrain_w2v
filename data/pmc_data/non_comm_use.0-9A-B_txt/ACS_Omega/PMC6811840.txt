Coating load and distribution in
gas diffusion layers (GDLs) for
polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) have a major influence on mass
transport losses. To be able to optimize the coating distribution
and get more accurate data about the influence of the coating on the
PEFC performance, better characterization techniques are necessary.
Common analysis techniques are limited to selected sections of the
material, or they are not sensitive to small amounts of coating. We
propose a new methodology to get a complete description of the coating
distribution and the GDL structure by combining high-resolution X-ray
tomography with high-resolution neutron tomography. Using an isotopic
gadolinium staining method to enhance the neutron and X-ray absorption
contrast, lower quantities of coating can be detected. The combination
of both imaging techniques allows for a more detailed analysis of
the coating distribution.

Introduction
Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs)
are among the technologies
expected to have an important role in the energy transition toward
renewable energy. They operate by generating electricity through an
electrochemical reaction. In the anodic electrode, hydrogen is oxidized,
producing protons, and in the cathodic electrode, oxygen is reduced,
consuming protons and producing water. Due to the sluggish kinetics
of the reaction, in particular the oxygen reduction reaction, a catalyst
is required to improve the cell performance; in the large majority
of cases, a layer composed of platinum nanoparticles supported in
carbon is used.1

The reactant gasses
are brought into the cell through a series
of channels in a flow field and are transported through the gas diffusion
layer (GDL) to the catalyst layer of each electrode where the reaction
takes place. The two cell compartments are separated by a polymer
electrolyte membrane (PEM), which conducts the protons, avoids the
gas cross over, and acts as an electrical insulator. The water produced
at the cathode is transported through the GDL in the opposite direction
to the reactant and exits the cell through the same gas channels in
the flow field.

Water management is one of the main challenges
to maximize the
power output of PEFCs. On the one hand, the PEM needs to be hydrated
to be a proton conductor and to avoid degradation. On the other hand,
an accumulation of water in the GDL layer can hinder the reactant
access to the catalyst generating mass transport losses. These losses
become particularly important when the cell operates at high current
densities because the reactant consumption rate is larger and the
water production is higher.2

The
most commonly used water management strategies comprise modifying
the GDL in order to improve water removal.3 GDLs are usually papers, fleece, or cloths made out of carbon fibers
with a fiber diameter of approximately 10 μm. In the majority
of cases, the GDLs have thicknesses between 100 and 400 μm with
the most common thickness around 200 μm and a mean pore size
of 20 μm4 and are chosen because
of their good electrical and thermal conductivities, high gas permeabilities,
and sufficient chemical and mechanical resistances. State-of-the-art
GDLs undergo hydrophobic treatment and feature an additional layer,
facing the PEM, with small pores (<1 μm) called microporous
layer.5,6 The hydrophobization is achieved by coating
the carbon fibers with a fluoropolymer, generally poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) or fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). The most common coating
methodology is to imbibe the GDL in an aqueous solution containing
the fluoropolymer and drying the material, after which the fluoropolymer
particles are then sintered by heat treatment. An optimal amount of
hydrophobic coating reduces the wettability of the GDL, limiting water
accumulation and thus improving the PEFC performance.7−9 However, the addition of coating can also decrease the electric4 and heat conductivity10,11 and reduce the effective diffusivity.7,12,13 Thus, an excess of coating is detrimental to performance,
and improved application methods are highly desired. Since the contact
angle is a surface property, an ideal coating would be a thin layer
well covering the fibers, with a negligible occupation of the pore
volume.14

Many studies were conducted
about how the coating load affects
the PEFC performance, and the results vary from an optimum coating
load of 5 to 20%3,8 depending on the type of substrate
and the conditions used for the analysis. This disparity shows that
coating load is not a sufficient criterion to analyze the effect of
coating on performance. Nevertheless, it is the main parameter used
to compare coatings, as it is straightforward to measure, unlike other
more precise criteria such as the coating distribution. Yet, this
distribution is of high importance, and a homogeneous distribution
is not trivial to obtain.

Mathias et al.3 studied the through-plane
distribution of coating and found that coating tends to accumulate
in the surface regions of the GDL, leaving the bulk with a lower coating
load. The authors determined that this disparity in distribution was
generated during the drying step of the coating. Later, Rofaiel et
al.15 associated this inhomogeneous distribution
with water retention in the GDL during operation. Hiramitsu et al.16 studied the effect of coating distribution in
the GDL on performance and degradation. They compared two different
types of fluoropolymers: PTFE and polyperfluoro(4-vinyloxy-1-butene)
(Cytop). They used an atomic force microscope to screen a small section
of the fiber and reported that the PTFE yields an inhomogeneous fiber
coating and Cytop yields a more homogeneous coverage, though the distribution
of the coating throughout the GDL was not specified. They analyzed
the GDL properties after long-term performance experiments and concluded
that a homogeneous coating can help prevent GDL degradation since
it limits the oxidation of the carbon fibers.

More recently,
Thomas et al.17 have
proposed a different application method for hydrophobic coatings based
on electrochemical grafting, and Van Nguyen et al.18 have also proposed a new methodology based on direct fluorination.
Both studies reported some improvement on fuel cell performance in
comparison to classical coating application methods. These examples
show that a deeper understanding of the coating distribution is needed
to explain some of the experimental discrepancies that can be seen
in the literature, helping researchers to better comprehend water
transport in the GDL and manufacturers to optimize their coating procedures.

The complexity of the material limits the techniques available
for determining coating distribution. Hiramitsu et al.16 used atomic force microscope surface analysis
to distinguish the fiber coverage of the GDL. Nevertheless, the area
of analysis includes only a few fibers, and the information of the
coating distribution on a representative area of the GDL cannot be
achieved with this technique since due to the inhomogeneous morphology
of the GDL a larger area including several pores should be analyzed
to be representative. Rofaiel et al.,15 Mathias et al.,3 and Ito et al.13 employed a combination of scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
The coating distribution was obtained from the SEM image of the GDL
cross section combined with the elemental mapping provided by EDS.
These techniques are accessible in many research institutes, but the
results must be interpreted carefully. EDS is a macroscopic surface
technique, and due to the porous aspect of the sample, only the surfaces
directly facing the exterior will be accessed. Another drawback related
to the porosity of the material is that cross sections where the coating
has not been damaged or deformed are extremely challenging to obtain
and the measurement is limited to one section of the GDL. Depending
on the morphology of the material, this section may not be fully representative
of the bulk material. The main drawback, however, is that, due to
border effects and the low molecular weight of fluorine, small amounts
of coating are difficult to be detected by SEM or EDS. Mendoza et
al.19 improved the technique slightly by
taking a similar approach but combining SEM with Raman spectroscopy.
The surface planes of the GDL can be analyzed with this technique
obtaining a better spatial resolution and a lower detection limit,
as low as 5.4% coating load. Nevertheless, only coating accumulations,
not fiber coverage, can be detected, and the bulk information is lost.

To get a more accurate idea of the 3D distribution of the coating
in the GDL, Fishman and Bazylak20 and Khajeh-Hosseini-Dalasm
et al.21 used X-ray tomographic microscopy
(XTM). With this technique, the coating cannot be directly distinguished
from the fibers due to a similar cross section of the interaction
of X-rays with carbon and fluorine and small amounts of coating cannot
be detected. However, it is a powerful method to visualize the pore
structure in three dimensions, and transport properties such as the
relative diffusivities and permeabilities can be computed from this
information.22,23

To summarize, the main
limitation of the current methods is that
they are either only applicable to small fractions of the sample or
unable to distinguish between the carbon fibers and the hydrophobic
coating. Here, we propose to combine XTM with neutron tomographic
microscopy (NTM) to obtain a detailed insight into the coating distribution
in GDLs. Using radiation grafting, we incorporate an isotopically
enriched contrast enhancement agent specifically to the coating (see Figure 1). The main interest
of using neutron imaging lies in the fact that one isotope of gadolinium, 157Gd, has a very strong interaction with thermal neutrons:
The total cross section of 239800 barns24 is more than 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of carbon (5.5
barns). In consequence, the carbon fibers are invisible to NTM and
the coating distribution could be obtained without any disturbance
from the edge of the fibers, provided that a sufficient spatial resolution
is available. The recent advances in the available neutron imaging
instrumentation led to enhancement of the spatial resolution capabilities
of NTM to the sub-10 μm domain.25 Combining the information of the coating provided by NTM with the
detailed structural information provided by XTM, we obtain a precise
description of the three-dimensional coating distribution throughout
the entire GDL on volumes large enough to be representative of the
corresponding material.

The process includes copolymer grafting and immersion in 157GdCl3 for ionic exchange of the protons in the acid groups,
finally resulting in a material with 157Gd stained coating.

Results and Discussion
Sensitivity of the NTM
Method
In Figure 2, an in-plane slice from the NTM measurement
of a sample stained only locally (in bands with a width of 500 μm)
is represented. The attenuation coefficient provided by the stained
coating is very high (10–100 cm–1) due to
the large cross section of 157Gd. In comparison, the neutron
attenuation coefficient is 0.3 cm–1 for carbon with
a density of 2.0 g·cm–3. Correspondingly, a
negligible signal is measured in the unstained areas, which confirms
our assumption that the NTM method is able to measure the coating
distribution with high contrast and without any disturbance from the
GDL structure.

μm wide areas separated by 1000 μm. The areas without
staining are not visible in the neutron radiography.

Local Coating Distribution and Fiber Coverage
The pore
structure, mean pore size, fiber morphology, and distribution and
the presence and characteristics of the binder may alter significantly
the coating coverage of the GDL. One of the most common materials
used in fuel cell research, the SGL Sigracet 24 series (simply called
“SGL” hereinafter), has a very heterogeneous pore diameter
distribution with low fiber density. In their production process,
the carbon fibers are impregnated with carbonizable resins26 that act as binders, which are afterward graphitized.
The binder forms porous structures that accumulate mainly at the intersections
of the fibers. These small binder pores, combined with the large fiber
pores, result in a broad pore size distribution. The binder can hardly
be distinguished from the coating, as intensity fluctuations (Figure 3b) may either stem
from the contrast agent or from density variations. Some groups have
managed to segregate the binder from the carbon fiber structure, yet
they were not able to discern a binder from a fluoropolymer.27 These characteristics make SGL an interesting
material to test the newly proposed technique with low coating loads
since the coating detection is more complex than for other GDL materials.

and (c) 3D reconstruction rendering of the XTM data from the neighboring
area of the selected slice, highlighted by the orange rectangle and
the orange arrow, two isolated fibers with thin coating coverage.

In Figure 3, the
imaging results for a SGL 24 AA with 9% coating load are presented.
The three different components are hardly distinguishable in the XTM
slice (Figure 3b).
With our methodology, only the coating is stained since the graphitized
binder and the carbon fibers will not be altered by the treatment.
In the NTM slice (Figure 3a), the bright white spots correspond to the Gd stained coating.
As expected, coating accumulates mainly at the fiber intersection,
but single fiber coating coverage can also be detected. In this type
of material, the coating seems to distribute in three different ways:
at the fiber intersection, finely spread over the binder, or covering
specific isolated fibers, as highlighted with arrows in Figure 3. In Figure 3c, segmented data from the XTM measurements
is presented, and this reconstruction helps visualize the immediate
surroundings of the fiber. To do the 3D rendering the program, VGSTUDIO
was used, and for all cases, 11 slices were used, showing information
from 5 slices before and 5 slices after of the selected slice as a
center, in this case Figure 3b. The absence of crossing fibers in front or behind the highlighted
fibers confirms that the coating identified in these positions do
cover single, isolated fibers.

A fleece-like substrate such
as the Freudenberg H23 presents a
different type of challenge. This substrate has no binder, so the
coating interacts directly with the carbon fibers. The pore size distribution
of a Freudenberg GDL is much narrower,15 and the fibers are more frequently grouped in bundles. These characteristics
make it an interesting sample for studying the coating coverage of
fibers since the FEP interacts directly with the fiber instead of
the binder, but the material has a very high fiber density, which
makes the coating more likely to accumulate in the multiple fiber
intersections. In order to improve the homogeneity, we used a vacuum
coating application,28 and since the detectability
limits of the technique were being tested, low coating loads were
also employed.

In Figures 4 and 5, slices of the NTM and
XTM and the 3D reconstruction
of the selected area are shown for the Freudenberg H23 with 9% FEP
coating load. Figure 4 shows a detailed area of the surface region of the sample, and Figure 5 shows a detailed
area of the bulk. Although Gd, being a heavy element, also works as
a contrast agent for X-rays, thin coating layers cannot be identified
from the XTM images. The main limitation stems from the edge effects
at the border of carbon fibers. Due to phase contrast effects, a pair
of peaks appear, one positive and the other negative, in the intensity
profile (see Figure 4d,e). These peaks fall into the same intensity range as the stained
coating and make it impossible to differentiate them. Large coating
accumulations can be identified from the XTM slice and 3D rendering
(Figure 4b,c), mostly
present in the form of patches at the fiber intersections or filling
the space between adjacent fibers. As mentioned previously, the NTM
data allows identification of the coating distribution without the
disturbance of the carbon fiber structure. Elongated coating structures
may give the impression of a homogeneous fiber coverage. However,
a careful comparison of both data sets (XTM and NTM) shows that the
coating is mostly localized at the fiber intersections or between
parallel fibers.

the XTM data from the neighboring area of the selected slice; fibers
are colored gray, and coating is colored green. The large green section
on the right side of the images is the aluminum film used to separate
samples.

In the bulk section of the GDL
(Figure 5), there is
clearly less coating, and only
a very few coating accumulations can be identified from the XTM data
set (Figure 5b,c).
On the other hand, the NTM image (Figure 5a) shows that small amounts of coating are
spread over many other locations—note that the display scale
is different from the previous figure to emphasize them. This illustrates
how the 157Gd staining allows for a very low detection
limit of coating. The resolution of the NTM, however, does not make
it possible to identify whether the coating fully covers the fibers.
From the comparison of the NTM and XTM data sets, we can observe that
the coating mostly occurs in regions where several fibers coincide
and it may therefore be that the coating is mostly filling the spaces
between fibers. Thus, we cannot identify the presence of single fibers
covered with coating, like observed for the SGL material.

Through-Plane
Coating Distribution
Besides the local
coating distribution, an important information for GDL coating procedures
is the evenness of coating through the material thickness. Figure 6 shows a single slice
projection of the cross section of the Freudenberg H23 sample with
9% coating under vacuum (same sample as used for Figures 4 and 5). Similar to the previous analysis, coating can only be identified
from XTM (Figure 6b)
in the form of large agglomerations near the surface region. In the
NTM data set (Figure 6a), these large coating accumulations appear as an intense white
signal, as expected from the higher concentration of the contrast
agent, but the presence of smaller amounts of coating is visible across
the entire GDL.

Figure 6 Cross section through-plane tomography slices for Freudenberg
H23
sample coated in vacuum with 9% FEP. (a) Neutron microtomography and
(b) X-ray microtomography.

This strongly inhomogeneous distribution across the material thickness
does not appear for all coating application procedures. Figure 7 displays the average coating
distribution of four different samples. To obtain this data, the registered
NTM 3D data sets were averaged along the width of the whole material.
Since each sample contains a different amount of coating, the contrast
of each image was individually adjusted to maximize the visibility.
Nevertheless, the absolute values of the corresponding attenuation
coefficients allow a quantitative sample-to-sample comparison.

of coating (as measured by the Gd concentration profiles)

microtomography data. (a) Freudenberg H23, 9% FEP, vacuum coated.
(b) Freudenberg H23, 30% FEP. (c) Freudenberg H23, 70% FEP. (d) SGL
Sigracet 24AA, 9% FEP.

As can be seen in Figure 7, different distributions
can occur, including a flat and
homogeneous distribution through the material (Figure 7c), a slightly asymmetric distribution (Figure 7b), and configuration
where the coating is minimal in the center (Figure 7a, corresponding to the sample analyzed previously)
or in the borders (Figure 7d). This methodology allows the analysis of the whole sample
and is therefore more representative of the material compared to the
single cross sections, which can be obtained by SEM-EDS or SEM-Raman
techniques. It must be noted that, although the average data was extracted
here out of a the high-resolution data set acquired for the purpose
of the local distribution analysis, the extraction of coating distribution
profiles could be obtained by keeping the same 157Gd staining
methodology but using a lower resolution setup, for example, an anisotropic
setup with a high resolution only in the direction across the sample
and/or using two-dimensional imaging instead of computed tomography.
Doing so would allow measurement of a higher number of samples and
analysis of the reproducibility of the coating procedures. This technique
has been applied for in-house FEP coated samples, but the same methodology
is applicable for commercially available PTFE coated samples as well
as most available fluoropolymers.

Conclusions
Using
a combination of X-ray and neutron tomographic microscopy,
we demonstrated novel possibilities for three-dimensional, high-resolution
analysis of the coating distribution in fuel cell GDLs. The coating
is made specifically visible to neutrons by incorporating a strong
contrast agent, 157Gd, which also provides additional contrast
for X-rays. Analysis of different samples has shown that X-rays allow
the high-resolution imaging of the material structure and of important
coating accumulations, while the high selectivity of neutrons to the
contrast agent provides the complementary information of the distribution
of smaller amounts of coating not detectable by X-rays. For a given
material substrate (SGL Sigracet 24AA), the combined analysis evidenced
that the coating is also found around single, isolated fibers, while
for the second substrate (Freudenberg H23) the coating mostly accumulates
at the intersections and in the spaces between parallel fibers. The
developed methodology will be an invaluable asset for the characterization
of coating methods and thus the development of an “ideal”
coating providing optimal coverage of the carbon surface with a minimal
obstruction of the pores.

Experimental Section
Coating Application Procedure
Commercial GDLs were
coated and irradiated following a procedure similar to the one previously
reported by Forner-Cuenca et al.29 For
this experiment, carbon fleeces (Freudenberg H23) and carbon papers
(SGL Sigracet 24AA) were used. The coating was applied using two different
methodologies. The standard coating procedure was to dip the GDL into
an aqueous solution of FEP (FEPD121, 55% (w/w) solids, DuPont) for
1 min. The initial solution concentration determines the final coating
load, and the relation between initial concentration and final coating
load can be found elsewhere.30 The second
methodology consisted of employing the same type solution containing
FEP but submerging the GDL in solution under vacuum. For the coating
under vacuum, the sample was placed in a sealed reactor and the pressure
was reduced to approximately 0.6 bar. Under these conditions, the
coating solution was transferred to the reactor and the sample was
submerged for 1 min. After this time, the reactor was opened to ambient
pressure and the sample was removed from the solution. In both cases,
after imbibition, the samples were placed in a vacuum oven and dried
for half an hour at room temperature. Afterward, the temperature was
raised to 70 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min and held for an
hour. The samples are then left to slowly cool down. The complete
drying process was carried out under vacuum. The coated GDLs were
subsequently sintered by heating them under air at 250 °C for
20 min followed by another 20 min at 280 °C. After this, they
were let to cool down slowly.

Staining Procedure
The coated GDLs were activated using
an electron beam (EBLab 200 sealed laboratory emitter system, Comet
AG, Switzerland). The samples were exposed to a dose of 50 kGy under
nitrogen (<200 ppm oxygen), employing an acceleration voltage of
200 keV.

For testing the sensitivity of the method, a radiation
mask with slits of 500 μm was used to partially block the radiation.
This process generates samples with modified areas of 500 μm
with a separation of 930 μm (Figure 2b). The samples were grafted using 15% (w/w)
acrylic acid (Sigma Aldrich) in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ·cm)
for 30 min at 60 °C using a methodology similar to the one employed
by Forner-Cuenca et al.29

For the
coating analysis, after activation, the samples were grafted
by submerging them in a reactor with a 0.5 M sodium p-styrene sulfonate (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.5 M acrylic acid (Sigma
Aldrich) solution in ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ·cm). The
reactor content was purged with N2 for 1 h and placed in
a water bath for 24 h at 60 °C.

All samples were afterward
cleaned by rinsing them with water,
ethanol, and water again using a vacuum table. The GDLs were then
dried, and the ionic exchange was made by placing them in a 0.015
M 157GdCl3 (Trace Sciences International, 92.3%
isotopical enrichment) solution for 24 h (Figure 1b). They were later rinsed with water and
dried again.

Sample Conditioning for Tomography
For the sensitivity
test of the NTM, the sample was cut in strips of approximately 3.0
× 0.7 mm2.

For the coating analysis, in order
to maximize the beam time used, the samples were cut in squares of
approximately 0.7 × 0.7 mm2 and placed in a glass
capillary with an outer diameter of 1 mm, using aluminum foils in-between
samples to avoid their movement. The capillary was then sealed on
both ends. In this case, the same set of samples was used for the
neutron tomography and afterward for the X-ray tomography.

Neutron
Tomographic Microscopy (NTM)
The neutron microtomography
was performed at the POLDI beamline31 of
the SINQ spallation source at PSI, using the neutron microscope as
a detector.32 Slits were used to collimate
the beam to an L/D ratio of 250
to limit the blurring due to beam divergence. The measurement was
done by using 375 projections equally distributed over a full 360°
rotation performed three times, acquiring three images of 60 s exposure
for each projection. After passing the sample, the neutrons were captured
using a thin isotopically enriched 157Gd2O2S:Tb scintillator screen.33 The
CCD camera (Andor iKon-L, pixel size 13.5 μm) was used to collect
the scintillator light output. The resulting isotropic voxel size
was 2.7 μm, and the estimated effective resolution was about
10 μm. The open source software Muhrec34 was used, for the reconstruction, using the filtered back projection
(FBP) method with a Hamming window. Prior to this, all images were
corrected using the following steps: outlier removal, subtraction
of the detector background and scattered neutron background using
the black body grid method described elsewhere, and correction of
the beam fluctuation.35 For the scattered
neutrons correction, the black body fitting for the requirements of
the neutron microscope was designed and manufactured.36 Finally, the corrected images were filtered using a Gaussian
filter (σ = 0.75) with the open source software ImageJ.37

After tomographic reconstruction, the
3D neutron data sets were registered to the X-ray data sets by using
control points and optimizing a linear coordinate transformation using
ImageJ.

Micro X-ray computed tomography (XTM)
XTM was performed
using a Nanotom-m Lab-CT scanner (GE Measurements & Control) at
PSI. The samples were imaged using an acceleration voltage of 60 kV
and a current of 250 μA. For each scan, 800 projections were
recorded during the 360° sample rotation. Each projection consists
of two averaged images with an exposure time of 5 s each. An 83-fold
magnification was used, which results in a final voxel size of 1.2
μm. The linear attenuation coefficients obtained out of the
X-ray tomographic reconstruction were validated by measuring the value
obtained for the aluminum foil used to separate the samples. An exact
theoretical value cannot be calculated due to uncertainties in the
X-ray energy spectrum, but a measured attenuation coefficient of 0.5
cm–1 corresponds an X-ray energy of 23 keV, well
within the expected range for the X-ray spectrum.
