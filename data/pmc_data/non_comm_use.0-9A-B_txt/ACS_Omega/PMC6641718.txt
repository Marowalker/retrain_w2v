How
to effectively enhance the antitracking performance of silicone
rubber is a huge challenge in the field of high-voltage insulation.
In this contribution, amine-containing MQ silicone resin (A-MQ) was
prepared to enhance the tracking and erosion resistance of addition-cure
liquid silicone rubber (ALSR). The results showed that A-MQ imparted
ALSR with excellent tracking and erosion resistance. When A-MQ content
was 4 phr, all test samples passed the inclined plane test at 4.5
kV, and the erosion mass decreased by 67.8%. In addition, the tensile
strength and tear strength increased by 13.2 and 13.6%, respectively,
compared with that of ALSR without A-MQ. The suppression mechanism
was further investigated in the aspects of heat attack and plasma
bombardment by laser Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, thermogravimetry-Fourier
transform infrared spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, attenuated
total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. This revealed that at the elevated temperature
caused by arc discharge, A-MQ promoted crosslinking of the polysiloxane
molecules and suppressed the generation of cyclic oligomers, which
reduced the intensity of the electrical arc. Moreover, when suffering
from plasma bombardment, which was also produced by arc discharge,
A-MQ protected the silicone chains from degradation and eliminated
the carbon deposited on the surface.

Introduction
Owing
to its hydrophobicity, chemical resistance, high temperature
resistance, and excellent electrical properties, silicone rubber (SR)
has been extensively used in various electrical applications, such
as overhead transmission lines, power stations, and cable accessories.1−3 However, due to its organic nature, when suffering from dry-band
arcing, a peculiar surface defect called tracking and erosion failure
is unavoidable for silicone rubber, which leads to a great hidden
danger for the security of the power system.4 To improve the antitracking performance of SR, the addition of inorganic
fillers, such as alumina trihydrate,5 alumina
(Al2O3),6 silica
(SiO2),7 boron nitride,8 and titanium dioxide,9 is the most commonly used method. Unfortunately, a high loading
(>50 wt %) is required for the desired tracking and erosion resistance.
In this case, the mechanical properties and processability of SR are
inevitably seriously damaged.10 Moreover,
with the development of electrical engineering, a higher reliability
of insulation materials is expected.11 Therefore,
it is imperative to develop a more efficient antitracking additive
to enhance the antitracking performance of SR.

Introducing arc-quenching
materials including melamine compounds,
urea compounds, and guanine compounds into SR is considered to be
one of the most promising methods to significantly enhance the tracking
and erosion resistance of SR,12 because
they can rapidly evolve inert gases to quench the electric arcs through
the deionizing and cooling effect during arcing.13 Schmidt and co-workers14 used
15 phr of melamine cyanurate (MC) in combination with 100 phr silica
to enhance the tracking and erosion resistance of SR. The results
showed that all samples containing MC passed the inclined plane (IP)
test at 4.5 kV due to the arc-quenching ability of MC. However, melamine
cyanurate also has poor compatibility with SR, resulting in deterioration
of the mechanical properties. Our previous work15 indicated that a small amount of ureido-containing siloxane
(US) effectively enhanced the tracking and erosion resistance of addition-cure
liquid silicone rubber (ALSR), and the correlation between the thermostability
and antitracking properties was studied in detail. However, because
dry-band electrical arc is essentially high temperature ionized gas,16 during the arc discharge, ALSR was subjected
to not only thermal attack but also plasma bombardment, resulting
in degradation of the silicone chains. Moreover, our further studies
found that many organic additives (e.g., polyborosiloxane, shown in Figure S1) improved the thermostability of ALSR
but had no effect on the tracking and erosion resistance of ALSR,
clearly indicating that the suppressed mechanism was not solely dependent
on the improvement of thermal stability. In addition, the solid residue
formed during dry-band arcing also had a close relation with the tracking
and erosion performance.17 Therefore, an
explanation based only on the improvement of thermal stability of
ALSR/US seemed to be insufficient, and it is of scientific and industrial
importance to better our understanding of the antitracking mechanism
of ALSR/US.

To further study whether it is the peculiar characteristics
of
the ureido group that improve the tracking and erosion resistance
of ALSR, a common nitrogen-containing silane, N-(β-aminoethyl)-γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(AEAPTES), which has the same nitrogen per molecule as that of the
ureido-containing siloxane, was used to enhance the antitracking performance
of ALSR. However, it is worth noting that AEAPTAS is also easily hydrolyzed
when exposed to a wet environment, resulting in a decrease of its
efficiency. As is well known, MQ silicone resin, consisting of a monofunctional
chain element (R3SiO1/2, i.e., M) and tetrafunctional
chain element (SiO4/2, i.e., Q), is widely used as a reinforcing
filler for silicone rubber.18,19 In addition, MQ silicone
resin has excellent hydrolysis resistance, weathering ageing resistance,
and radiation resistance.20−22 Therefore, if nitrogen-containing
groups were attached to MQ silicone resin, there would be a strong
possibility of endowing ALSR with superior tracking and erosion resistance
and mechanical properties.

In this work, an amine-containing MQ silicone resin (A-MQ) was prepared by the hydrolytic
condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), N-(β-aminoethyl)-γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane,
hexamethyldisiloxane (MM), and divinyltetramethyldisiloxane (MViMVi). Then, A-MQ was introduced into addition-cure
liquid silicone rubber to enhance the tracking and erosion resistance.
The effect of A-MQ on the tracking and erosion resistance and mechanical
properties of ALSR was investigated. The possible antitracking mechanism
of A-MQ was further explored by laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS), thermogravimetry
(TG), thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated total reflection-Fourier
transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS).

Results and Discussion
Mechanical Properties
Table 1 shows the
effect of A-MQ content on the
mechanical properties of ALSR. As shown, the mechanical performance
of ALSR showed an obvious improvement with the addition of A-MQ. The
tensile strength, elongation at break, and tear strength of ALSR increased
at first and then decreased with increasing A-MQ amount. When the
content of A-MQ was 3 phr, the tensile strength and tear strength
of ALSR reached their maximum with values of 8.9 and 36.7 kN·m–1, respectively. Because A-MQ has more vinyl groups,
these can react with the Si–H groups to form a more concentrated
crosslinking network in ALSR. The appropriate concentration of crosslinking
network can effectively disperse the stress to more molecular chains,
thus improving the mechanical properties.25 However, when the crosslinking density is too high, the tensile
strength and tear strength of ALSR decrease. When A-MQ was 1 phr,
the elongation at break of ALSR reached its maximum with the value
of 712%. The reason for this might be that A-MQ improves the dispersion
of SiO2 in ALSR,22 and the good
dispersion of SiO2 suppresses the filler network to increase
the elongation at break of ALSR.26 When
the content of A-MQ further increased, the crosslinking density of
ALSR also increased and played the dominant role, resulting in the
decrease of elongation at break of ALSR.

Inclined Plane
Test
Figure 1 presents the tracking and erosion performance
of the ALSR samples with different A-MQ content. When the voltage
of 4.5 kV was applied, ALSR without A-MQ failed quickly within 40
min due to the overcurrent. After A-MQ was added, the time to failure
greatly increased. When A-MQ content was 2 phr or more, ALSR passed
the IP test at 4.5 kV for all samples. In addition, A-MQ also decreased
the eroded mass of ALSR. When the content of A-MQ was 4 phr, the eroded
mass of ALSR/A-MQ was the least, decreasing by 67.8% compared to that
of ALSR. As can be seen from Figure S2,
in comparison with those of ALSR, the number of leakage current impulses
of ALSR containing 4 phr A-MQ was greatly reduced, and the magnitude
of leakage current also decreased. The results indicate that A-MQ
not only suppressed the generation of arc discharge, but also reduced
the intensity of arcs.

of ALSR in the IP test at 4.5 kV.

Raman Spectroscopy Analysis
To investigate the effect
of A-MQ on the tracking resistance of ALSR, LRS was adopted to characterize
the residue of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ (4 phr) after the IP test. Figure 2 shows the LRS spectra
of the residue of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ after the IP test. As can be
seen in the spectrum of ALSR, the peaks at 1347 and 1595 cm–1 were assigned to the D band and G band, which are associated with
the breathing mode of aromatic rings with dangling bonds in plane
terminations and the bond stretching mode of the sp2 carbon
pairs in both rings and chains, respectively.27,28 Thus, the appearance of the D and G peaks indicated that graphitic
carbon had been deposited on the surface of ALSR during the IP test.
As reported,17 the presence of carbon distorted
the electric field distribution on the surface and increased the electrical
field stress at the vicinity of the defected interface, resulting
in severe damage of the surface (as shown in Figure S3) and the decrease of tracking time. In the spectrum of ALSR/A-MQ,
there were no peaks around 1200–1600 cm–1, indicating that no carbon was deposited on the surface during the
IP test. This result implied that the incorporation of A-MQ suppressed
the generation of carbon, which might account for the high tracking
resistance of ALSR/A-MQ.

Figure 2 LRS spectra of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ after the
IP test.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The continuous dry-band
arc discharge releases a lot of heat, which leads to thermal oxidative
degradation on the surface of ALSR.29 Thus,
it is necessary to investigate the effect of A-MQ on the thermal oxidative
stability of ALSR. Figure 3 shows the TG and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves
of A-MQ, ALSR, ALSR/A-MQ (4 phr), and ALSR/A-MQ (cal.), and their
characteristic data are summarized in Table 2. The curve of ALSR/A-MQ (cal.) was calculated
as shown in eq 1 1  where, W1 and W2 are the weight curves of A-MQ
and ALSR, ω1 and ωa are the contents
of A-MQ and all
of the ingredients in the formula; when A-MQ content is 4 phr, the
ratio of ω1 to ωa is 0.027. As can
be seen, the T5% of ALSR/A-MQ was almost
the same as that of ALSR, but compared to ALSR/A-MQ (cal.), the T5% of ALSR/A-MQ increased by 42.3 °C, indicating
that A-MQ could improve the initial thermal stability of ALSR. In
addition, in comparison with that of ALSR/A-MQ (cal.), the Rmax of ALSR/A-MQ decreased by 23.0% and the
residue at 800 °C increased by 18.2%. This result demonstrates
that there were some chemical reactions occurring between A-MQ and
the silicone chains during thermal degradation. Figure S4 shows the TG and DTG curves of ALSR, ALSR/Vi-MQ,
ALSR/N-MQ, and ALSR/A-MQ, and their characteristic data are summarized
in Table S1. As can be seen from Figure S4 and Table S1, the T5% of ALSR/Vi-MQ and ALSR/N-MQ were almost the same as
that of ALSR, but the residue at 800 °C increased by 6.7 and
11.6%, indicating that both Vi-MQ and N-MQ suppressed the degradation
of ALSR. Interestingly, the increment of ALSR/A-MQ to ALSR (18.2%)
was equal to the linear addition of those of ALSR/Vi-MQ and ALSR/N-MQ
to ALSR (6.7 and 11.6%), revealing that A-MQ could suppress the degradation
of ALSR due to the effect of vinyl and amino groups.

Evolved Gases Analysis
To further study the effect
of A-MQ on the thermal degradation of ALSR under an air atmosphere,
TG-FTIR was used to analyze the evolved gas products. Figure 4 shows the three-dimensional
(3D) TG-FTIR spectra of the pyrolysis gases in the thermal degradation
of (a) ALSR and (b) ALSR/4 phr A-MQ under an air atmosphere. The FTIR
spectra of the total volatile products for various samples are shown
in Figure 5. For ALSR
and ALSR/A-MQ, six small molecular gaseous species could be identified
by their characteristic absorbance peaks: carbonyl compounds (1745
cm–1), cyclic oligomers (2966, 1264, 1074, 1026,
and 849 cm–1), methane (3017 and 1304 cm–1), CO (2179 and 2114 cm–1), CO2 (2359
and 2314 cm–1), and H2O (3500–3700
cm–1).

products of ALSR
(a) and ALSR/A-MQ (b) during thermal degradation (air, 20 °C·min–1).

pyrolysis products of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ
during thermal degradation.

Figure 6 shows
the
evolution curves of the pyrolysis products as the FTIR absorbance
of the pyrolysis products versus temperature, wherein the amount of
gas released is reflected by the peak areas. As demonstrated, cyclic
oligomers were the main evolved gas for both ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ. Moreover,
it has been reported that cyclic oligomers can activate discharges
produced on the surface of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), which promote
stable dry-band arcing and increase the intensity of arcing.30 Thus, the variation of evolution of the cyclic
oligomers versus temperature attracted the most concern. As shown
in Figure 7, the release
of cyclic oligomers was induced by an unzipping reaction and random
scission.31 The unzipping reaction was
triggered by the silanol groups, which were generated by oxidation
of the side groups, along with CH2O. As can be seen from Figure 6a,c, the evolution
of CH2O and cyclic oligomers from ALSR/A-MQ was the same
as that from ALSR between 342 and 468 °C, indicating that at
the early stage, cyclic oligomers were evolved mainly by an unzipping
reaction, and A-MQ did not suppress the initial oxidation of the side
groups. The release of CH4 occurred via the cleavage of
methyl groups by a radical mechanism, which promoted the formation
of a tight silicone network (shown in Figure 7d).32 From Figure 6b,c it can be seen
that the amount of evolved CH4 from ALSR/A-MQ was much
more than that from ALSR, and the evolution of cyclic oligomers from
ALSR/A-MQ dramatically decreased beyond 468 °C. To further clarify
the effect of A-MQ, TG-FTIR tests of ALSR/Vi-MQ and ALSR/N-MQ were
also conducted. As can be seen from Figure S5b,c, the evolution of CH4 from ALSR/Vi-MQ was almost the
same as that from ALSR, but the evolution of cyclic oligomers from
ALSR/Vi-MQ decreased compared with that from ALSR, indicating that
the high number of vinyl groups in Vi-MQ improved the crosslinking
density of ALSR, suppressing the generation of cyclic oligomers, but
had little effect on the radical mechanism. For ALSR/N-MQ, the evolution
of CH4 increased and cyclic oligomers decreased, compared
with ALSR, revealing that the amino groups in N-MQ enhanced the catalytic
effect of Pt on the radical mechanism. Therefore, the effect of A-MQ
was attributed to two aspects. On the one hand, the amino groups in
A-MQ significantly enhanced the catalytic effect of Pt on the radical
mechanism, which promoted the formation of the compact and thermostable
ceramic layer.33 Such a ceramic layer could
protect silicone chains from further degradation. On the other hand,
the high vinyl group content in A-MQ increased the crosslinking density
in ALSR, which restricted the movement of silicone chains and improved
the activation energy of the occurrence of random scission.34 At elevated temperature, Si–CH3 in polysiloxane molecules and CH4 are very likely to
transform into carbon.35 As shown in Figure 6a,d–f, the
evolution of CH2O, CO, CO2, and H2O from ALSR/A-MQ increased above 557 °C, in comparison with
that from ALSR. As is clear from Figure S5a,d–f, when Vi-MQ was added, the evolution of CH2O, CO, CO2, and H2O from ALSR decreased. However, the evolution
of CH2O, CO, CO2, and H2O from ALSR/N-MQ
increased, compared with that from ALSR. The results indicate that
at elevated temperature, amino groups in A-MQ promote the oxidation
of Si–CH3 and CH4, reducing the amount
of carbon deposited on the surface of ALSR.

The arc discharge can generate plasma, which produces electron,
positive and negative ion, and free radical bombardments on the surface
of silicone rubber.36 These bombardments
result in the thermal oxidation and bond scission of polysiloxane
molecules, forming surface char residue.37 This residue increases the intensity of the dry-band arc, making
silicone rubber tracking easily, thus, plasma bombardment is also
a main cause of tracking and erosion of SR. To further investigate
the effect of A-MQ on the tracking resistance, a low temperature plasma
jet device was used to treat ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ (4 phr).

Morphology
Analysis
Figure 8 shows the SEM images of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ
after plasma treatment for different lengths of time. As can be seen,
there was a noticeable difference in the surfaces of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ
after plasma treatment. For ALSR, the local surface was seriously
damaged, the polysiloxane was eroded, and loosely bound filler appeared
on the surface after 1 h of plasma treatment. With increasing treatment
time, the erosion became more and more serious, and the damage area
became increasingly extended. As for ALSR/A-MQ, the surface was smooth,
and there were no noticeable defects after 1 h of treatment, indicating
that A-MQ suppressed the bombardments, protecting the polysiloxane
molecules from degradation. When the treatment time was 2 h, there
was no erosion of polysiloxane or precipitation of filler particles
on the surface, but some cracks appeared. When the treatment time
reached 4 h, the amount of cracks increased greatly. Surprisingly,
there were still no erosion defects.

Figure 8 SEM images of the surface of ALSR (a)
and ALSR/A-MQ (b) after plasma
treatment for 0 h (0), 1 h (1), 2 h (2), and 4 h (3).

ATR-FTIR Analysis
Figure 9 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra
of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ
after plasma treatment for different lengths of time. The polysiloxane
molecule is mainly composed of Si–CH3 and Si–O
structures, and the corresponding characteristic peaks are located
at 1260 and 1020 cm–1.38 As can be seen from Figure 10, with increasing treatment time, for ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ,
the peak intensities of Si–CH3 and Si–O both
continuously decreased, indicating that plasma could destroy the side
groups and backbone of polysiloxane molecules.

Figure 9 ATR-FTIR spectra of ALSR
and ALSR/A-MQ after plasma treatment for
different lengths of time.

Figure 10 Ratio (Si–CH3/Si–O) of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ
after plasma treatment for different lengths of time.

To acquire more information about the chemical
changes of the species,
the absorption peak ratio of Si–CH3 to Si–O
was calculated. The ratio of the absorption peaks (Si–CH3 to Si–O) of the untreated sample was defined as 100%.
A reduction in the absorption ratio shows a degree of surface deterioration.39 The variations of peak ratio (Si–CH3 to Si–O) of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ with treatment time
are shown in Figure 10. As can be seen, with increasing treatment time, the ratios of ALSR
and ALSR/A-MQ both decreased; when the treatment time reached 3 h,
the ratios of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ tended to remain constant. However,
over the whole treatment time, the ratio of ALSR/A-MQ was much higher
than that of ALSR. The results further confirm that A-MQ protected
the polysiloxane molecule from plasma radiation.

XPS Analysis
Figure 11 shows
the C 1s XPS spectra of the surface of ALSR
and ALSR/A-MQ after 4 h of plasma treatment, and the relevant characteristic
parameters are summarized in Table 3. After 4 h of plasma treatment, the C 1s spectrum
of the surface of ALSR was split into five peaks. The peak at 284.5
eV was assigned to Si–C/C–H in the silicone chains.40 The peaks at around 288.1 and 289.3 eV were
attributed to C=O and O–C=O, respectively,41 which were formed by the oxidation of Si–CH3 in the silicone chains. The peak at 285.5 eV was assigned
to C–Si in the cross-linked network.42 The peak at 284.8 eV was assigned to C=C in the aromatic
species,43 indicating that plasma promoted
cleavage of the side groups of polysiloxane molecules to generate
graphitized carbons. When A-MQ was added, with the same duration of
plasma treatment, the structural content of C=O and O–C=O
decreased, and the content of Si–C/C–H and C–Si
in the crosslinking increased by 15.8 and 200%, respectively. This
result can be explained by the Pt-catalyzed effects, whereby C–H
of the methylene group adjacent to the amine group in A-MQ was activated
to seize the polysiloxane macroradicals,44 which formed a tight crosslinking network (as shown in Figure 12). In addition,
the increase of crosslinking density hindered the movement of macroradical
chain segments to suppress further degradation of silicone chains.
Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the peak of graphitized carbon
disappeared in the C 1s spectrum of the surface of ALSR/A-MQ, indicating
that A-MQ also suppressed the formation of graphitized carbon, which
is in accordance with the Raman results.

the surface of ALSR and ALSR/A-MQ after 4 h

Conclusions
Amine-containing
MQ silicone resin was successfully synthesized
by the hydrolytic condensation of TEOS, AEAPTES, MM, and MViMVi. A-MQ could effectively enhance the tracking and erosion
resistance of ALSR. When 4 phr of A-MQ was added, all test samples
passed the inclined plane test at 4.5 kV, and the erosion mass decreased
from 2.86 to 0.92 g. In addition, the mechanical properties were also
enhanced. The LRS results revealed that A-MQ suppressed the generation
of carbon during the arc discharge. The TG and TG-FTIR results indicated
that at elevated temperature, A-MQ promoted crosslinking of the polysiloxane
molecules and suppressed the generation of cyclic oligomers, which
reduced the intensity of the electrical arc. The SEM, ATR-FTIR, and
XPS results revealed that when suffering from plasma bombardment,
which was produced by arc discharge, A-MQ could protect the silicone
chains from degradation and eliminated the carbon deposited on the
surface.

Preparation of A-MQ
In a 250 mL four-neck flask, 17.8
g of MM and 2.2 g of MViMVi were added to a
solution composed of 10.8 g of HCl, 10.0 g of EtOH, and 14.4 g of

Preparation of ALSR Samples
with Different A-MQ Content
VPDMS and fume silica were mixed
well by a kneader to obtain masterbatch.
Subsequently, masterbatch, PHMS, A-MQ, and 1-ethynylcyclohexanol were
stirred vigorously. Then, Karstedt’s catalyst was incorporated
and mixed well. Finally, the mixture was vulcanized at 120 °C
for 10 min under 8 MPa to obtain the ALSR sample. The formula of ALSR
is listed in Table 4.

VPDMS	100	
PHMS	nSiH/nvinyl = 1.7	
SiO2	40	
1-ethynylcyclohexanol	0.06	
A-MQ	0–4	
Karstedt’s
catalyst	0.38	
Characterization
FTIR and ATR-FTIR spectra of the samples
were obtained using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer over the wave
number range of 400–4000 cm–1. The liquid
samples were coated on the surface of KBr tablets.

1H NMR spectra were obtained by using a Bruker Avance III HD 600 NMR
spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard.

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
was performed using a Waters
515 HPLC pump (Waters) equipped with a Shodex K-G guard column and
a Shodex K-804L chromatographic column. Detection was achieved using
a Waters 2414 refraction index detector, and the sample was analyzed
at 30 °C using chloroform as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL·min–1. The instrument was calibrated using narrow polydispersity
polystyrene standards.

Tensile and tear tests of the cured samples
were conducted on a
universal testing machine (UT-1080, China) according to ASTM D 412
and ASTM D 624, respectively. The shore A hardness was measured with
a Shore A durometer (LX-A, Shanghai Yuanling Instruments Factory,
China) according to ASTM D 2240.

Tracking and erosion property
analysis was carried out by an inclined
plane tracking and erosion resistance test apparatus (DX8427, Dongguan
Daxian Instruments Co., Ltd., China) according to IEC 60587-2003 standard.
A schematic diagram of the inclined plane test setup is shown in Figure 14, and digital photos
of the tracking equipment and sample setup are shown in Figure S8. Each test sample was 120 × 50
× 6 mm3 and mounted at an inclination of 45°.
Two electrodes were fixed on the surface of each test sample with
a distance of 50 mm. During the test, a constant alternating current
voltage of 4.5 kV was applied to each sample, along with a flow rate
of 0.6 mL·min–1 of standardized conductive
solution (0.10 wt % NH4Cl and 0.02 wt % isooctylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol).
Five specimens were tested for each formulation. When the leakage
current exceeded 60 mA for 2 s, the test apparatus recognized this
moment as the time to failure. After 6 h of IP testing, a sample without
excess current was regarded as having passed. After the IP test, the
eroded portion of the test samples was cleared away, and the decreased
mass of the specimen was recorded as the eroded mass.

Figure 14 Schematic diagram of
inclined plane test.

Laser Raman spectroscopy of the residue of SR after the IP
test
was determined by a Raman microspectrometer (Renishaw inVia, Renishaw
Co., Britain) at an optical range from 3000 to 100 cm–1 with a 532 nm helium–neon laser source.

Thermogravimetric
analysis was carried out by using a thermogravimeter
(TG209, Netzsch Instruments Co., Germany) from 30 to 900 °C at
a linear heating rate of 20 °C·min–1 under
an air atmosphere. The samples were measured in an alumina crucible
with a weight of 5–10 mg.

The TG-FTIR instrument consists
of a thermogravimeter (TG209, Netzsch
Instruments Co., Germany), a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
(Tensor 27, Bruker Optics Inc., Germany), and a transfer tube with
an inner diameter of 1 mm connecting the TG and the infrared cell.
The investigation was carried out from 30 to 900 °C at a linear
heating rate of 20 °C·min–1 under an air
flow of 30 mL·min–1. To reduce the possibility
of pyrolysis gas condensing along the transfer tube, the temperatures
of the infrared cell and transfer tube were set to 230 °C.

A low temperature plasma jet device (PlasmaFlecto 10, Plasmatechnology
GmbH Co., Germany) was used to treat the ALSR samples. Each treatment
sample was 10 × 10 × 2 mm3. The test was conducted
under an air atmosphere with a power of 300 W. The highest temperature,
which mainly appeared at the discharge area, was no more than 60 °C.
Before treatment, all samples were cleaned with isopropanol and deionized
water, separately.

The morphology of the surface of the SR samples
after plasma treatment
was investigated via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Merlin
Carl, Zeiss Jena, Co, Germany) at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV.
Prior to measuring, samples were coated with a thin gold layer by
means of a vacuum sputter to improve electrical conductivity.

The attenuated total reflection (ATR) technique enables identification
of specific molecules and groups located in the surface layer, typically
1–10 μm deep. In this paper, attenuated total reflection-Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (Bruker Tensor 27) was used to study
the chemical structure of the SR surface after plasma treatment.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was recorded on a Kratos Axis
Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer by employing a monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray source.
