Lanthanide(III)
ion (Ln(III)) sensing has become a major research
area owing to its intriguing prospect in clinic, biology, and environmental
studies. However, the existing methods have limitations like requirement
of expensive instrumentation, long analytical times, and sample pretreatments,
revealing the necessity of other methods. In this work, by using N-methyl-4-pyridinium tetrazolate (mptz) zwitterion as an
electron acceptor, we obtained several new Ln(III) compounds with
electron-transfer (ET) photochromic properties: [Ln(NO3)3(H2O)4]·mptz [Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3), La (4), Ce (5), Pr (6), Nd (7),
Tb (8), Dy (9), Ho (10), Er
(11), Tm (12), Yb (13), Lu
(14)]. Notably, different Ln(III) ions in these compounds
can be visually identified by their different photoinduced color changes
related to the ET process. This work may not only contribute to the
more understanding of the structure–photosensitivity relationships
of pyridinium-based compounds, but also provide a new approach for
Ln(III) ion sensing.

==== Body
Introduction
Interest in the determination
and sensing of specific lanthanide(III)
ions (Ln(III)) has grown considerably in the last decade because of
their significant roles in environmental and biological systems.1−6 Based on spectrophotometry or fluorescence, there are already some
commonly used nondestructive methods for the Ln(III) ion sensing.7−10 However, these methods can only be used to analyze a small amount
of samples because they have limitations such as time-consuming analysis,
high cost, and sample preprocessing. Thus, the instantaneous sensing
of an individual Ln(III) simply and economically is still a challenge.

In recent years, several electrode sensors have been developed
to select Eu(III).11−14 They make the analysis simpler and are able to detect specific species
in situ and in real time. These results inspired us to explore the
combination of Ln(III) ions with electron-transfer (ET) photochromic
behavior, which may allow us to achieve a unique way to Ln(III) ion
sensing. Photochromic materials have attracted considerable attention
in recent years due to their appealing applications.15−20 As a typical example, photochromic materials with N,N′-disubstituted bipyridinium (viologen)
show the proverbial ligand-related ET photochromic behavior21−27 and structure varieties after ligand modification.28−32 Previously, we chose the N-methyl-4-pyridinium
tetrazolate (mptz) zwitterion to achieve two new ET photochromic compounds,
[Zn(mptz)2]Br2 and [Cd3(mptz)2Cl6]n·4nH2O,33 revealing
the electron-accepting ability of mptz in ET photochromic process
for the first time. These results are very helpful for our further
investigation on the sensing ability of the photochromic rare-earth
compounds with mptz.

In this work, based on mptz, we found a
new series of rare-earth
coordination compounds, [Ln(NO3)3(H2O)4]·mptz [Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3), La (4), Ce (5),
Pr (6), Nd (7), Tb (8), Dy
(9), Ho (10), Er (11), Tm (12), Yb (13), Lu (14)]. Notably,
after light-induced electron transfer from nitrate anion to mptz,
most of these compounds showed obvious color changes (Figure 1), and different Ln(III) ions
of these compounds can be visually distinguished by their different
color changes.

size: 5.0 × 4.8 × 0.2 mm, 70 min illumination by a 300 W
Xe lamp).

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure and Characterization
Compounds 1–14 were obtained by
the hydrothermal
reaction of mptz with Ln(NO3)3. The phase purities
of their crystalline products were verified by PXRD determinations
and elemental analysis (Table 2, and Figure S1 and Table S2 in
the Supporting Information (SI)). Structural analysis by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction shows that complexes 1–14 crystallize in the triclinic space group P1̅ and exhibit discrete mononuclear Ln(III)–mptz unit.
The asymmetrical structure unit contains one [Ln(NO3)3(H2O)4] molecule and one isolated mptz
unit. As shown in Figure 2, the Ln(III) unit has one Ln(III) atom tecacoordinated by
six O atoms of three nitrate anions and four water molecules. Since
compounds 1–14 are all isostructural,
we choose 1–3 to make a general description
of the structures of 1–14.

Figure 2 Coordination
geometry of the Ln(III) ion in 1–3 [Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3)]. Hydrogen atoms
are omitted for clarity.

In compounds 1–3, one Ln(III)
unit is linked to three adjacent mptz through five O–H···N
bonds between coordinated water and azole ring of mptz (Table S4, and Figure S4a in the SI). Powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Figure S1 in
the SI) and TG analysis data (Figure S3 in the SI) indicate that 1–3 are
stable up to ∼95 °C, then show a weight loss between 104
and 194 °C, in accordance with the removal of four water molecules
(found: 12.32, 12.65, and 12.07%; calculated: 12.65, 12.62, and 12.51%
for 1–3, respectively). Besides,
π···π stacking of centroid-to-centroid
(3.581/3.974 Å (1), 3.580/3.958 Å (2), and 3.581/3.945 Å (3)) between the adjacent
mptz molecules further strengthens the stability of structures (Table S5 and Figure S4b in the SI).

Photochromic
Properties
After illumination by a 300
W Xe lamp in atmosphere, compounds 1–14 displayed different color changes in 1 min and no clear crystal
structure changes by PXRD determinations (Figure S1 in the SI). No further color change was observed by the
naked eye after 40 min irradiation, demonstrating the saturation of
coloration (Figure 3, and Figure S5 in the SI) and giving
different new UV–vis absorption bands (380 nm for 5, 516 nm for 7, 574 nm for 13, 582 nm for 14, and 530–550 nm for other compounds). Such changes
in the UV–vis spectrum are similar to those in our previous
work.33 The photoproducts of 1–14 can last up to at least 3 weeks in the dark,
but can be decolored completely in air by heating at 95 °C for
1 day.

Figure 3 Time-dependent UV–vis spectra (left) for 1 (a), 2 (c), and 3 (e) and their ESR spectra (right)
for 1 (b), 2 (d), and 3 (f).
The as-synthesized samples are named as 1A, 2A, and 3A, while the irradiated samples are named as 1B, 2B, and 3B, respectively.

The light-responsive wavelength
of 1–14 is ca. 290–360 nm,
and the optimal wavelength is
315–330 nm, respectively. Such characteristic wavelength dependence
property indicates a photoinduced coloration mode but not a photothermal
fashion.34 Besides, the transformation
between coloration and decoloration can be repeated several cycles
upon illumination and annealing. It can be best exemplified by monitoring
the 536 nm absorption band of 1 (Figure S6 in the SI) that implies typical photochromic behaviors.

We further investigated whether these compounds have photochromic
behavior after water loss, finding that they did not show clear color
changes, which may be due to the structure collapse that we studied
before.33 Since the collapsed structures
of 1–14 after losing water are difficult
to be figured out, the special cause of loss of photochromic behavior
for these compounds after removing water remains to be studied.

Photochromic Mechanism
As mentioned above, compounds 1–14 have shown the similarity of structure
and photochromic behaviors. Since the compounds 1–3 have shown the most obvious color change after irradiation,
and the Sm(III), Eu(III), and Gd(III) in 1–3 are the most commonly used ions in luminescence studies
of Ln(III) compounds, we choose 1–3 to further study the photochromic mechanism of these compounds for
clarity. As depicted in PXRD and IR analyses (Figures S1–S2 in the SI), the crystal structures of 1–3 experienced no obvious changes after
illumination, indicating that the coloration of 1–3 should not result from photolysis or photoinduced isomerization.
No ESR signal could be observed in the spectra of 1 and 2 before irradiation, but the radical signals with g = 2.0042 and 2.0028 appeared after coloration, respectively
(Figure 3b). The signal
shape and g values are very similar to those in compounds
[Zn(mptz)2]Br2 and [Cd3(mptz)2Cl6]n·4nH2O, indicating the generation of mptz radicals.33,35 Thus, the new absorption peak of 1 and 2 at 536 nm should belong to the generation of mptz radical.36,37 Unlike the other two, the radical signal of 3 cannot
be observed directly, which may be blurred by the strong ESR signal
of Gd(III) with half-filled electronic configuration f7, with the value of g factor equal to
2 in this state.38

Total and partial
DOS were calculated by VASP to theoretically elucidate ET processes
of 1–3. As shown in Figure 4, similar DOS results can be
found on 1 and 3. The Sm/Gd atoms and water
molecules contribute little to the top of the valence bands (VBs)
or the bottom of the conduction bands (CBs). VBs are primarily contributed
by p–π orbitals of the nitrate anions,
while the CBs are mainly dominated by p–π* antibonding orbitals of the mptz. Accordingly, the photochromism
of 1 and 3 can be considered as the result
of photoinduced nitrate anions → mptz ET. This conclusion can
also be confirmed by the interactions between mptz and adjacent nitrate
anions. There exist intermolecular C–H···O H-bonds
between nitrate anions and mptz in the structure with the C···O
distances in the range of ca. 3.253–3.461 Å. Moreover,
the nearest distances between nitrate anion donors and mptz acceptors
in one molecule are even shorter, with the O···N+ lengths of ca. 2.917, 2.914, and 2.919 Å for 1, 2, and 3, respectively (O···N+ in 1 are shown in Figure S7 in the SI), revealing the possible photochromic mechanism,
ET from nitrate anions to mptz, of these compounds.39

Figure 4 Total and partial DOS of 1 (a), 2 (b),
and 3 (c). Positions of Fermi levels set at 0 eV by default.

On the other hand, the DOS of 2 shows a slight difference.
As shown in Figure 4b, VBs are mainly dominated by p–π
orbitals of the nitrate anions with some contribution of mptz p–π orbitals, while the contribution for CBs
is similar to that in 1 and 3. These results
reveal that the photochromism of 2 is similar to that
of 1 and 3, with different VBs that may
be ascribed to the influence of Eu(III) on the Ln(III)–mptz
coordination sphere.

Lanthanide Ion Sensing
It is known
that major efforts
for developing Ln(III) ion sensing were focused on the design of fluorescent
sensor molecules in recent years.8,40−44 However, these methods may not be suitable for the Ln–mptz
compounds in this work, due to the significant interference from other
ions or ligands.9 As Figure 5 illustrates, the excitation and emission
spectra of free mptz, 1 and 3, at room temperature
are similar, while only 2 shows distinguished patterns.
On the other hand, as mentioned above, the Ln–mptz compounds
have shown different photoinduced visible color changes, which are
based on ET photochromic process affected by different Ln(III) ions.
It is then theoretically feasible that these color changes can be
used to identify the Ln(III) ions in these samples. Further investigations
on the potential application of Ln(III) sensing are merited.

Figure 5 Excitation
(black line) and emission (red line) spectra of free
mptz (a), 1 (b), 2 (c), and 3 (d) at room temperature.

To further study the sensing ability of these color changes
toward
different Ln(III) ions, finely grained crystalline samples (50 mg
each) of 1–14 were deposited on glass
plates for the photoinduced color change studies. With the same condition
as UV–vis measurement, all of the samples were irradiated by
Xe lamp at room temperature for 70 min to ensure the saturation. As
shown in Figure 1,
the samples showed different photoinduced visible color changes in
solid state, while the shape and position of new absorption peaks
of these compounds are also clearly related to the identity of the
Ln(III) ion (Figure S5 in the SI), confirming
the relationship between certain Ln(III) ions and the specific color
changes of related Ln–mptz compounds in the solid state. Interestingly,
these visible color changes can be roughly divided into three types:
turn into red (Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb); become brown (La, Pr, Nd, Ho, Er,
Tm, Yb, Lu), and change slightly (Ce, Dy). Besides, it is notable
that some samples also show unique color before irradiation. For example,
only the Pr–mptz (6) sample shows green-yellow,
and the samples of La (4), Ho (10), and
Lu (14) are clear brown-yellow. These color differences
can also favor the Ln(III) ion sensing.

Such results inspired
us to find the reason for these particular
color changes. As mentioned above, compound 2 has a different
VB from 1 and 3, which not only shows the
influence of Eu(III) on the Ln(III)–mptz coordination sphere,
but also has an effect on the photoinduced color changing of Ln(III)–mptz
compounds. This variation can be attributed to the different interactions
between Ln(III) center and protonated mptz group in the structure
of [Ln(mptz)(NO3)3]·4H2O. It
is speculated that such interactions, depending on the nature of Ln(III)
ions, would differently affect the energy transfer efficiency from
nitrate anions to nearby mptz,45 leading
to the particular color changes.

Conclusions
Based
on previous studies about mptz zwitterion and ET photochromic
process, we further investigated a new family of photochromic rare-earth
materials, [Ln(mptz)(NO3)3] [Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3), La (4), Ce (5), Pr (6), Nd (7),
Tb (8), Dy (9), Ho (10), Er
(11), Tm (12), Yb (13), Lu
(14)]. They show distinct color changes after photoinduced
ET from nitrate anions to mptz, with the generation of stable radicals
in ambient condition at room temperature. Notably, based on their
different photoinduced visible color changes, the compounds also show
the possibility of Ln(III) ion sensing in solid state by ET photochromic
process. However, as some of the complexes show similar color changes,
it is not sufficient to determine the composition of an unknown sample
containing two or more Ln by ET photochromic process, unless their
absorption peaks are significantly different. This work may not only
go far toward understanding the structure–photosensitivity
relationships of pyridinium-based systems, but also provide a new
idea that can complement the existing sensing methods of Ln(III) ion
sensing.

Experimental Section
Materials and Measurements
mptz
was synthesized by
the literature procedure.46,47 Other chemicals of
AR grade purity were purchased commercially and used without further
purification.

All measurements except for thermogravimetric
(TG) analysis and elemental analyses were performed in atmosphere
at room temperature. The elemental analyses of C, H, and N were carried
out on an Elementar Vario EL III microanalyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns of 1–14 were collected
on a Rigaku MiniFlex II diffractometer powered at 30 kV and 15 mA
using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å), with a scan rate of
3° min–1. Simulated patterns were achieved
using the free Mercury software (http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/products/mercury/) and the reported single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. UV–visible
absorption spectra were measured at room temperature in the diffuse
reflectance mode on a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV/vis/near-IR spectrophotometer
with an integrating sphere attachment and BaSO4 plate as
a reference (100% reflection). A PLSSXE300C 300 W xenon lamp system
equipped with an IR filter was used to prepare colored samples for
PXRD, diffuse reflectance, and electron spin resonance (ESR). The
distances between these samples and the Xe lamp were around 35 cm.
The TG analyses of 1–3 were done
on a Netzsch STA449C-QMS403C thermal analysis-quadrupole mass spectrometer
under N2 atmosphere (20 mL min–1) at
a heating rate of 10 K min–1. FT-IR spectra of 1–3 were recorded in the range 4000–400
cm–1 on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer
using KBr pellets as the matrices. The ESR spectra of 1–3 were recorded at X-band frequency (9.867 GHz)
on a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were
measured on a double-grating Edinburgh FL920 fluorescence spectrometer
equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and a PMT detector.

Synthesis
Synthesis
of [Ln(NO3)3(H2O)4]·mptz
The reaction mixture of Ln(NO3)3·xH2O (0.40 mmol),
mptz (64 mg, 0.40 mmol), and water (4 mL) were sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined
autoclave and then heated to 120 °C at 2 °C/min and kept
at this temperature for 1 day. Then, the mixture was cooled to room
temperature at 2 °C/h to gain a clear yellow solution. By slow
evaporation of the solution, blocky single crystals (35–45%
yield based on mptz) were obtained and washed with ethanol. Anal.
Calcd (%) and Found (%) for 1–14 (C7H15N8O13Ln) are listed in Tables 2 and S2 (in the SI), and the phase purities of 1–14 were checked via PXRD (Figure S1 in the SI).

X-ray Crystallographic Study
X-ray
diffraction data
of the single crystals of 1–14 were
recorded at 298(2) K in air on a Rigaku Pilatus 200 K diffractometer
using graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å).
All absorption corrections were performed by using the multiscan program
and the structures were solved by direct method and refined by full-matrix
least-squares techniques on F2 with SHELXTL-2014
program package of crystallographic software.48 Nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms
in mptz were generated geometrically and refined isotropically. The
hydrogen atoms in water molecules were located in the idealized positions
and refined with O−H distances restrained to a target value
of 0.85 Å, the H–H distance to 1.34 Å, and Uiso (H) = 1.5 Ueq (O). Crystallographic parameters and structure refinement details
for 1–14 are summarized in Table 1 (1–3) and Table S1 (4–14), and the selected bond distances are given
in Table S3 (in the SI). The entries of
CCDC 1530985–1530987, 1559748–1559753, and 1560044–1560048 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for 1–14 (Table 2).

Theoretical Calculation
The crystallographic data of
compounds 1–3 determined by X-ray
single-crystal diffraction were used to calculate their electronic
structures, and no further geometry optimization was performed in
theoretical studies. The calculations employed the projector augmented
wave method encoded in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),49,50 with the local density approximation and the plane wave cutoff energy
of 500 eV. The numerical integration of the Brillouin zone was performed
using a 2 × 1 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling for the three compounds.
