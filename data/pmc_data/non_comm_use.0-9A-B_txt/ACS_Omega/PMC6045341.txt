Adhesiveness of hydrogels
depends on the balance and synergy of
their cohesion and adhesion. However, it is a challenge to fabricate
catechol-based hydrogels with high adhesiveness because the required
condition for cohesion and adhesion of these hydrogels is in conflict
with each other: strong cohesion (gelation) requires a weak basic
condition, whereas strong adhesion requires an acidic condition. Here,
we demonstrated that by utilizing polyphenol supramolecular chemistry,
the coexistence of strong cohesion and adhesion can be achieved in
a hydrogel via the one-pot method. Poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium
chloride)/tannic acid (PDDA/TA) hydrogel has been studied as a proof
of concept. Compared with catechol moieties that covalently grafted
on polymer chains, TA can bring high density of pyrogallol/catechol
functional groups for polymers via a noncovalent pathway, as well
as high acidity in the system. As a result, the cohesion of the hydrogel
is enhanced significantly, the highest storage moduli can reach up
to ca. 0.15 MPa; besides, the high acidity of the hydrogel prevents
pyrogallol/catechol groups from oxidation and guarantees strong adhesion;
thus, the hydrogel can adhere to diverse substrates steadily, including
tissues, glass, metals, and plastic. Moreover, because of the adjustable
adhesiveness via changing the pH, the PDDA/TA hydrogel becomes a unique
system with patternable adhesiveness. In addition, the hydrogel has
rapid self-healing and high ionic conductivity (∼4.3 S m–1). This study demonstrates that utilizing polyphenol
chemistry in the construction of hydrogels opens a new path toward
multifunctional hydrogels with improved properties.

1 Introduction
Mussel
is well-known for its ability to cling to diverse surfaces.
Catecholic amino acid 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (DOPA)
is the key component of its adhesive foot proteins (mfps).1−3 The catechol chemistry contributes to the universal adhesion as
a synergic system: first, the catechol group of mfp-3 and mfp-5 can
bond to substrates through the formation of reversible noncovalent
or irreversible covalent interactions, leading to high adhesion of
mfps;1 second, the catechol-rich mfp-1
and mfp-2 form bis and tris complexes with metal ions, resulting in
strong cohesion of mfps.4,5 To overcome the weakening
adhesiveness brought by the catechol oxidation, mussels generate a
seawater-free, acidified, and isolated environment to ensure strong
adhesion of mfp-3 and mfp-5 and further suppress the adverse effects
of catechol oxidation by adopting thiol-rich mfp-6 as a reducing agent.6−8 By forming a fine and hierarchical structure to balance adhesion
and cohesion, mfps help mussels to adhere to the rock steadily.

To mimic adhesive functionality of the DOPA-rich mfps, different
polymers containing catechol groups have been synthesized, which can
be further cross-linked into hydrogels with good wet adhesiveness.9−12 In general, the formation of catechol-based hydrogels requires elevating
the pH of polymer solutions from acidic to basic condition, in which
catechol groups work as the cross-link point through either polymerization
or multicoordinate bonds with metal ions.11 However, compared with sophisticated engineering of mussel byssus,
the man-made catechol-based hydrogel is too simple in both chemical
composition and hierarchical structures to have strong cohesion and
adhesion simultaneously, resulting in low mechanical strength and
weak adhesiveness. In particular, although catechol-based hydrogels
exhibit good adhesiveness to tissues by forming covalent bonds, they
present poor adhesiveness to engineered solids.3 This is because in catechol-based hydrogels, catechol groups
are either occupied by metal ions or oxidized into quinone or both;
as a consequence, the drastic reduction of the hydrogen bond of catechol
weakens the adhesiveness of the hydrogel to engineered solid surfaces
(Figure 1a).13−15 Besides, it is difficult to synthesize polymers bearing a high amount
of associate groups because of the technical limit.16,17 To overcome the above-mentioned limitation of catechol-based hydrogels,
we propose a new strategy based on polyphenol for developing robust
and adhesive hydrogels.

Figure 1 Schematic comparison of the molecular-level
mechanism of catechol-based
hydrogels and TA-based hydrogels on adhesion and cohesion. (a) Schematic
illustration of man-made catechol-based hydrogels. In catechol-based
hydrogels, the tris complex of catechol and metal ion works as a cross-linker
in hydrogels. However, the basic pH environment reduces the adhesion
of hydrogels. (b) Schematic illustration of the TA-based supramolecular
hydrogel presented in this study. The high density of pyrogallol/catechol
groups and the dendritic structure of TA provide strong adhesion and
cohesion in the hydrogel.

Tannic acid (TA) is a natural polyphenol that can be extracted
from various plants. It has valuable properties such as antioxidant,
antibacterial, and biodegradability based on the viewpoint of functional
materials.18,19 TA contains five pyrogallol and
five catechol groups, which can provide multiple bonding sites with
diverse interactions, including hydrogen bond, ionic bond, coordinate
bond, and hydrophobic interactions.20−22 The formation of metal-phenolic
networks (MPNs) via the coordination between catechol/galloyl functional
groups and metal ions has been explored by Caruso et al.23−27 The assembly of MPN has been applied in the generation of the thin
film or particles with tailored properties23 and in the formation of novel metallogels.26 Extending the application of various bonding modes of TA in materials
science has been booming recently.

In our previous study, we
have demonstrated that TA molecules can
be functionalized on polymer chains via a noncovalent pathway, and
they behave like covalently connected catechol groups in cross-linking
polymers to hydrogels.22 Herein, we first
report a multifunctional hydrogel with adjustable mechanical strength
and adhesiveness generated via adopting polyphenol chemistry. TA-based
polyphenol hydrogels provide solutions aiming at the weakness of catechol-based
hydrogels, as illustrated in Figure 1b. In this system, TA was used as a multiple pyrogallol-based
dynamic associate moiety, which interacts with poly(dimethyl diallyl
ammonium chloride) (PDDA) chains through ionic bonds on the one hand
and cross-links the polymer chains into networks by FeIII via coordination bonds on the other. Variable cross-link density
can be achieved by tuning the TA/PDDA weight ratios through supramolecular
assembly. As consequences: (i) the cohesion of hydrogels is dramatically
enhanced, and the highest storage modulus achieves ca. 0.15 MPa; (ii)
PDDA/TA/FeIII (PTFe) gel can be formed in a strong
acidic pH range (pH 1–3), which prevents pyrogallol/catechol
groups from oxidation, so that the hydrogels possess strong adhesiveness.
The hydrogel exhibited very strong adhesive strength to diverse substrates,
including tissues, glass, metals, and plastic. In addition, this PDDA/TA/FeIII hydrogel has rapid self-healing and high ionic conductivity
(∼4.3 S m–1). Because polyphenol is a kind
of a nature product, further investigation of polyphenol chemistry
in materials science will promote the fabrication of green materials
with versatile functionalities.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Formation of PDDA/TA/Fe
(PTFe) Hydrogels
The color of the catechol/Fe3+ complex depends on the
coordination number of Fe3+ to catechol, which is influenced
by its pH value.9 UV–vis spectroscopy
was used to monitor the catechol/Fe3+ stoichiometry of
these PDDA/TA/FeIII mixtures (Figure S1). Figure 2a shows the relative fractions of three coordination states of catechol/Fe3+, which were calculated based on the absorbance data in UV–vis
spectra of mixtures. When the pH was below 1.3, the mixture was green
because of the dominant monocatechol iron complexes. When the pH increased
above 1.7, the mixture turned blue/purple because of the formation
of bis complexes. When the pH further increased above 5.4, the mixture
turned red after the formation of tris complexes. Compared with the
single catechol group, the bis and tris complexes of TA/Fe3+ are formed at lower pH values, which is caused by the lower pKa value of TA (pKa 8.5).11,21Figure 2b presents the Raman characteristic of Fe3+/catechol coordination. Compared with those of PDDA, TA, and PDDA/TA
mixture, the PTFe-3gel shows significant differences in its spectrum.
The peaks around 1353 and 1487 cm–1 belong to Fe3+/catechol complex ring vibrations, and the peak around 593
cm–1 is assigned specifically to the bidentate chelation
of Fe3+ ions by the phenolic oxygen atoms of catechol.28 The intensity of the 593 cm–1 peak increases relatively compared with the other two peaks upon
increasing pH from 3.5 to 7.4, suggesting the increase of the bidentate
complex with elevating pH positively, which correlates with the transition
from bis- to tris-coordinated FeIII species.

fractions of mono- (green), bis- (blue), and tris-catechol/Fe3+ (red) complexes in the PTFe hydrogel as a function of the
pH. (b) Raman spectra of PDDA, TA, PDDA/TA mixture, and PTFe-3 hydrogels
with different pH values.

2.2 Mechanical Properties of PTFe Hydrogels
In the PDDA/TA/FeIII system, the gelation of mixtures
determined by the cross-link density is mainly contributed by two
parts: the connection via the electrostatic force between TA and PDDA
and that via metal–ligand between TA and Fe3+.22 These connections rely on the amount of pyrogallol/catechol
groups, namely, the concentration of TA and pH values. For PTFe-1,
the TA/PDDA ratio is relatively high. Therefore, a small increase
of the pH value will lead to the formation of an efficient cross-link
for gelation. At pH 0.87, the initial mixture was a highly viscous
solution containing a large amount of mono complexes (G″ > G′). Further increasing the
pH
leads to a change from mono to bis complex; as a consequence, the
mixture is cross-linked into a stable hydrogel (G′ > G″) (Figure 3a). As for PTFe-2 to PTFe-5 hydrogels, the
cross-linker density decreases with the decrease of the TA/PDDA ratio;
as a consequence, the mixtures require higher pH values for gelation.
We defined the critical gelation pH based on the rheological measurements
(Figure 3b). Figure S2 presents the loss tangent (tan δ
= G″/G′) of the initial
PTFe solution and corresponding hydrogels at critical gelation pH
values. As for the initial solution, the tan δ is larger than
1, indicating that the mixture is liquid. At the critical gelation
pH, hydrogels formed with tan δ < 1. PDDA/TA bicomponent
mixtures can also be gelled under a neutral pH condition,22 in which the critical gelation pH is dependent
on the TA/PDDA ratio as well (Figure S3). However, compared with the tricomponent system, the gelation of
the bicomponent mixture requires higher pH values, which may reduce
the adhesiveness of hydrogels, and their mechanical strengths are
much weaker than those of three-component hydrogels, resulting in
weak cohesion (Figure S4). These results
indicate that introducing coordinate bonds into the PDDA/TA bicomponent
system is critical to generate highly adhesive hydrogels.

PTFe-1 hydrogels with angular frequency sweeps

of PTFe hydrogels plotted as a function of pH at an angular frequency
of 25 rad s–1 and a strain of 1%. (d) Storage modulus
chart for various catechol-based hydrogels in different pH values.
Hydrogels include the gel prepared in this work marked as red (acidic
part), catechol-based chitosan hydrogels as green,29,30 gelatin/thiourea/catechol hydrogels as purple,31 catechol-based 4- or 8-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels
as yellow,9,32,33 catechol-based
protein or peptide hydrogels as dark gray,34,35 and catechol-based polyallylamine (PAA) hydrogels as blue.36

After gelation, the cross-link density further influenced
the modulus
of hydrogels, which can be tuned by changing the pH and the TA concentration.
Angular frequency sweep measurements were conducted on all PTFe hydrogels,
and G′ and G″ values
were found to be independent of the angular frequency (Figure S5), which reflects the predominant elasticity
of these hydrogels. Figure 3c shows the storage modulus (G′) of
PTFe hydrogels with different pH values and different TA/PDDA weight
ratios. For samples with the same TA/PDDA ratio, in pH 2–5, G′ highly depends on the pH; higher pH corresponds
to higher G′. When the pH is above 5, G′ remains constant because of the saturation of
coordination. For samples with different TA/PDDA weight ratios at
similar pH values, a higher TA concentration leads to a higher degree
of polymer cross-linking and higher G′ (Figure 3c).

It is worth
noting that PTFe hydrogels have high storage modulus
under strong acidic conditions, which is never reported before. For
example, the storage modulus of PTFe-1 at pH 3 was as high as 0.15
MPa. Figure 3d presents
the G′ values of various catechol-based hydrogels
under different pH conditions in this work and those reported in the
literature.9,29−36 Guo et al. reported catechol/chitosan hydrogels with highly substituted
catechol units (70%), the G′ value of the
hydrogel was only around 200 Pa at pH 3.30 Xu et al. employed the thiourea/quinone coupling for the polymer
cross-linking to mimic mfps.31 In their
systems, the hydrogel formed in pH 2 has the storage modulus around
400 Pa. The high toughness of acidic PTFe hydrogels in our case may
be contributed by structural features of both TA and PDDA: (i) TA
possesses a dendritic structure, which can interact with polymers
through multiple sites. Such a cross-linker with high functionality
provides more efficient gelation than that of the single catechol
group; (ii) the pKa value of TA is 8.5,
which is lower than that of the single catechol group (9.5) so that
TA has a stronger acidity than catechol;11,21 (iii) PDDA is a fully charged polyelectrolyte, its polymer chains
are much more rigid than a neutral polymer, such as PEG. Therefore,
a high cross-linker density and a rigid polymer network guarantee
the strong mechanical strength of PTFe hydrogels under strong acidic
conditions. Compared with traditional catechol hydrogels prepared
under basic conditions, the acidic hydrogel has advantages of preventing
the oxidation of catechol units and minimizing the hydrolysis of transition
metal ions, thus providing a foundation for high adhesion to engineered
substrates.

2.3 Adhesiveness of PTFe Hydrogels
We
further measured the adhesiveness of these PTFe hydrogels. As shown
in Figure 4a, two glass
vials were glued together by a thin layer of PTFe-2 (pH 2.6) hydrogel,
and they can be connected together by loading a 200 g weight. To better
understand the adhesive conditions of the hydrogel, we have tested
the adhesive strength of PTFe hydrogels composed of different TA/PDDA
weight ratios at various pH values (Figure 4b). For the hydrogel with a different TA/PDDA
ratio (PTFe-1 vs PTFe-2), the bulk adhesive strength is proportional
to the TA/PDDA ratio. For samples with the same TA/PDDA ratio, with
the increase of pH values, the bulk adhesive strength rises first
and then drops. The highest adhesive strengths of each hydrogel for
the pork skin, stainless steel (SS), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)
are 44.8 ± 4.0, 82.1 ± 4.7, and 75.6 ± 4.0 kPa (PTFe-2,
pH 2.5); 49.6 ± 0.4, 104.6 ± 12.4, and 90.1 ± 6.0 kPa
(PTFe-1, pH 2.0), respectively.

Figure 4 (a) Photograph of the test for the adhesiveness
of the PTFe hydrogel.
Two glass vials were glued together by the PTFe-2 (pH 2.6) hydrogel,
and they could hold a 200 g weight. (b) Adhesive strength plotted
as a function of PTFe hydrogels with different pH values, the tested
substrates were pork skin tissue, SS, and PMMA substrates.

In the hydrogel, the bulk adhesive strength is
determined by the
gel–substrate surface interaction (surface adhesion) and the
mechanical strength of gels (cohesion). In the adhesion of hydrogel–solid,
delamination occurs within a gel film, which is called cohesive failure,
whereas delamination occurring at the gel–solid interface is
called adhesive failure.37 In our system,
the strength of surface adhesion depends on the amount of free pyrogallol/catechol
moieties, whereas cohesion depends on the degree of TA/FeIII coordination. For samples with the same component ratio, elevating
pH values causes the increase of the TA/FeIII association
degree and, in turn, the reduction of free pyrogallol/catechol groups;
as a result, cohesion of hydrogels is enhanced accompanied by the
decrease of surface adhesion. The balance of cohesion and adhesion
endows hydrogels with the highest adhesive strength, and it is achieved
at the middle pH range. Figure 5a,b shows photographs of detached glass substrates which were
stuck by the PTFe-2 hydrogel under different pH conditions. In the
case of hydrogel at pH 2.1, the detachment happened at the gel body
instead of the gel–solid interface (cohesive failure), indicating
strong surface adhesion of pyrogallol/catechol to glass. For the hydrogel
at pH 5.0, the detachment happened at the gel/glass interface (adhesive
failure), showing weak surface adhesion of pyrogallol/catechol to
glass. On the basis of facile adjustable adhesion of PTFe hydrogels,
we can use the gel with different adhesiveness as a patterned stamper.
As shown in Figure 5c, a hollowed-out paper with the “gel” pattern was
first rinsed by 0.2 M NaOH and then covered on an adhesive PTFe hydrogel
(pH 2.7). The contact with the basic paper makes the adhesive hydrogel
nonadhesive. After uncovering the hollowed-out paper, the hydrogel
can be used to stamp various substrates with the gel pattern. pH-manipulated
adhesiveness provides a new strategy for the fabrication of patterned
adhesive hydrogels. It should be mentioned that the electrostatic
interaction between PDDA and a negatively charged surface is the fundamental
for the adhesive property of the PDDA/TA gel. On the basis of this,
TA plays a key role in the adhesion of hydrogels, through elevating
hydrogel cohesion and providing additional adhesiveness for hydrogels.
By fixing the concentration of PDDA, we have focused only on the influence
of the TA content and the pH to the adhesion of hydrogels in this
paper.

Figure 5 (a,b) Photographs of detached glass substrates and an illustration
of the proposed mechanism for PTFe hydrogel adhesion at the solid
interface. The hydrogels used in photographs were PTFe-2 pH 2.1 for
(a) and PTFe-2 pH 5.0 for (b). (c) Scheme of fabrication of the PTFe
hydrogel with the gel pattern. The prepared hydrogel can stamp to
various substrates, including paper, PMMA, glass, stainless steel,
and titanium. The tested hydrogel was PTFe-2 gel, pH 2.7.

The PTFe hydrogel has a broad application as glue
for versatile
materials. We further tested the adhesive strength of the PTFe-1 (pH
2) hydrogel to glass, metals, and plastic (Figure 6a). The hydrogel can stick on these solid
surfaces tightly with adhesive strengths between 80 and 120 kPa. Figure 6b compares the adhesive
strength of catechol-based hydrogels reported in the literature and
PTFe hydrogels in this work. For tissue substrates (graphics without
outlines), the majority of reported studies have utilized the oxidation
of catechol to achieve strong adhesion, and the adhesive strength
of these hydrogels varies considerably in different systems.34,38,39 The adhesive studies of catechol-based
hydrogels to engineered materials are limited (graphics with outlines).
The thiourea-functionalized acidic catechol hydrogels reported by
Xu et al. can stick on glass with a strength of 21 kPa.31 Obviously, compared with catechol-based hydrogels,
polyphenol TA-based hydrogels with adhesive strengths of 80–120
kPa in this study exhibit outstanding adhesiveness, especially in
engineered substrates. The dendritic structure of polyphenol TA as
a cross-linker provides not only acidic condition to keep strong adhesion
but also multiple binding sites with polymer chains for strong cohesion,
giving rise to outstanding adhesiveness.

Hydrogels include the PTFe gel prepared in this work marked as red,

blue.41 The graphics without outlines are
attributed to the adhesiveness on tissue materials, whereas those
with outlines are attributed to engineered solid materials.

2.4 Self-Healing
Ability of the PTFe Hydrogel
The dynamic bonds between PDDA
and TA and TA and FeIII endow the PTFe hydrogel with a
great self-healing property. Figure 7a shows the self-healing
test of the PTFe-2 (pH 3.3) hydrogel. Two cylinder PTFe-2 gels were
cut in half (one dyed by pyranine) and put together. After cured for
1 h, the damaged interface completely healed. Figures 7b and S6 present
the quantitative tests of self-healing properties of PTFe hydrogels
by using rheometry. Hydrogels were subjected to increasing strains
until failure, and the recovery of mechanical properties was monitored
as a function of time. Upon the application of a large amplitude oscillatory
strain, both G′ and G″
values decreased and G′ became lower than G″, indicating a network destruction.9,35,42,43 When the applied strain was returned to 1%, both G′ and G″ recovered to their initial
values within seconds, showing the rapid self-healing ability of PTFe
hydrogels.

Figure 7 (a) Photographs showing the self-healing ability of the PTFe-2
(pH 3.3) hydrogel. The bright-green hydrogel was doped with pyranine,
and the photographs were taken under UV light (wavelength 365 nm).
(b) Quantitative tests of the self-healing properties of the PTFe-2
hydrogel (pH 3.3). Strain was increased from 1 to 1000% at 1 Hz, and
the recovery was monitored at 1% strain with 1 Hz.

2.5 Ionic Conductivity of the
PTFe Hydrogel
In the PDDA-based hydrogel system, a good ionic
conductivity of
the PDDA aqueous solution remained after the solution was cross-linked
into the hydrogel. The conductivity is around 4.3 S m–1 for all tested PTFe hydrogels (Table S2). The ionic conductivity is attributed to the high concentration
of the electrolyte. The resistance of PTFe hydrogels during self-healing
and relaxing–bending cycles was measured by using a multimeter.
We coated the hydrogel on the PDMS substrate for a convenient operation. Figure 8a shows the resistance
of the PTFe-2 (pH 3.3) hydrogel during the bending tests. In the bending
state, the resistance of the hydrogel is slightly higher than that
in the relaxing state, which is caused by the deformation of the hydrogel
during bending. Figure 8b presents the resistance of the PTFe-2 (pH 3.3) hydrogel during
the self-healing tests. The conductivity of hydrogels after eight
cut–heal cycles still recovered completely. In particular,
Fe3O4 solid nanoparticles can replace Fe(III)
salt in above hydrogel systems, resulting in magnetic, self-healable,
and conductive hydrogels. We have tested the PDDA/TA/Fe3O4 hydrogel as magnetic-responsive power switch in a circuit
with an LED light. The circuit is composed of an LED bulb as the electrical
load, a hydrogel as part of a conductor, and two dry batteries (2
× 1.5 V) as the power source, as shown in Figure 8c. When the magnet approaches, the hydrogel
is attracted to the magnet, resulting in a closed circuit and lighting
up of the bulb. This result indicates that polyphenol chemistry is
not limited to homogeneous systems and that it may have broader application
in heterogeneous systems.

bending and relaxing

changes as a function of repeated healing cycles. The inset photographs
showed that the hydrogel conductor can self-heal in the circuit. The
tested hydrogel in (a,b) was PTFe-2 (pH 3.3). (c) PDDA/TA/Fe3O4 magnetic gel as a power switch in the circuit.

3 Conclusions
The PDDA/TA/FeIII (PTFe) hydrogel with robust, adhesive,
rapid self-healing, and ionic conductive abilities has been reported.
The construction of this multifunctional hydrogel utilizes polyphenol
(TA) as a supramolecular cross-linker. Compared with single catechol
moieties that are covalently grafted on polymer chains, TA brings
a high density of pyrogallol/catechol groups for polymers via a noncovalent
pathway. As a result, the system can be cross-linked into the hydrogel
in an acidic condition (pH 1–4). The high cross-link density
with multiple functionality guarantees the strong cohesion of the
hydrogel. The storage modulus of hydrogels enhanced with the increase
of the TA/PDDA weight ratio, as well as the change of the TA/Fe3+ coordination number (mono- to tris-complexation), and the
highest storage modulus can reach to ca. 0.15 MPa (PTFe-1 pH 3). On
the other hand, because of the strong acidic pH condition preventing
the oxidation of pyrogallol/catechol, a high content of TA endows
the hydrogel with strong adhesion to diverse substrates, including
tissues, glass, metals, and plastic. The adhesive strength of the
hydrogel increased with the increase of the TA/PDDA weight ratio at
an optimized pH value. Moreover, PTFe hydrogels can be patterned with
different adhesion because of the adjustable adhesiveness via changing
the pH. In addition, PTFe hydrogels have rapid self-healing and high
ionic conductivity (∼4.3 S m–1) because of
the dynamic cross-links of hydrogels and the contribution of the polyelectrolyte,
respectively. Compared with traditional catechol-based hydrogels,
the TA-based hydrogels can be fabricated in large scale because of
low-cost materials and a simple fabrication process, which greatly
benefit their further applications.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
PDDA solution (average Mw 400 000–500 000, 20 wt
% in H2O) and TA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.
Anhydrous ferric chloride (FeCl3) was purchased from Aladdin
Company (Shanghai, China). Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) (99.9%, 20 nm in diameter) were purchased from Beijing DK Nano
Technology Co. LTD. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and ethanol were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All these reagents are used
as received. All aqueous solutions were prepared using Millipore water.

4.2 PDDA/TA (PT) Hydrogel Formation
The
hydrogels were formed by dissolving PDDA and TA in deionized water.
The PDDA concentration was 150 mg mL–1, and the
weight ratios of PDDA and TA in hydrogel samples are presented in Table S1. The viscous solution was spontaneously
cross-linked into the hydrogel with increasing pH to the desired value
by the addition of NaOH aqueous solution (3 M).

4.3 PDDA/TA/FeIII (PTFe) Hydrogel
Formation
The hydrogels were formed by dissolving PDDA, TA,
and FeCl3 in deionized water. The PDDA concentration was
150 mg mL–1, the molar ratio of TA to Fe3+ was fixed at 3:5, and the weight ratios of PDDA and TA in hydrogel
samples are presented in Table 1. A high-viscosity solution was spontaneously cross-linked
into the hydrogel with increasing pH to the desired value by the addition
of NaOH aqueous solution (3 M). On the basis of our previous study,
the PDDA/TA precipitate can be formed when the TA/PDDA weight ratio
is up to 0.6 in a wide pH condition (pH 1–11).22 Below this value, there is no precipitate in TA/PDDA mixtures.
In this study, the highest TA/PDDA weight ratio is maintained at 0.5
for avoiding the precipitation of TA/PDDA in all experiments (pH 1–11).
It should be mentioned that homogenous PTFe-1 and PTFe-2 gels were
obtained only under strong acidic conditions; the gels became too
rigid to form homogenous materials under weak acidic conditions.

Fe3O4 NPs were first dispersed
in the TA aqueous solution by sonication and stirring under an ice-water
bath (sonication for 20 s with 10 s break, 180 cycles, the sonication
power was 150 W). Then the suspension was gradually mixed with the
PDDA solution under sonication and stirring under the same condition
as mentioned above. The final PDDA concentration was 150 mg mL–1. The weight ratios of PDDA, TA, and Fe3O4 NPs are presented in Table 1. A high-viscosity solution was spontaneously
cross-linked into the hydrogel with increasing pH to the desired value
by the addition of NaOH aqueous solution (3 M).

4.5 Characterizations
The pH of hydrogels
was measured using the Mettler-Toledo LE427 pH puncture electrode.
The electrical conductivity was measured by a Mettler-Toledo conductivity
meter equipped with an InLab 731 electrode. The flexible and self-healing
properties during the conduction of the hydrogel were measured by
using a multimeter. Raman spectra were measured by using Raman spectroscopy
(HORIBA Scientific XploRA PLUS) with a 785 nm laser light as the excitation
source, and the laser power was 25 mW. The absorbance of the hydrogel
was measured by holding the gel between two quartz cover slips and
placing them directly in the light path of the spectrophotometer (Varian
Cary 50). Relative fractions of mono-, bis-, and tris-catechol/Fe3+ complexes were deduced by fitting a multi-Gauss function
in an iterative manner to the collected absorption profiles.9 The characteristic mono-, bis- and tris-complex
peaks were located at 615, 574, and 520 nm, respectively. The areas
of these characteristic peaks were converted into the relative fractions
by normalizing them to the maximum area value for each characteristic
peak.

The rheological properties of hydrogels were tested using
a rheometer (Thermo Scientific HAAKE) with a parallel-plate geometry
(35 mm diameter rotating top plate). The mechanical properties were
measured by performing angular frequency sweeps in the linear viscoelastic
range at a strain of 5%, while monitoring the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″).
The self-healing properties were investigated by straining the gels
from 1 to 1000% strain at a frequency of 1 Hz. Then, the recovery
of the hydrogel was measured by monitoring the storage modulus at
1 Hz and 1% strain. All characterizations were performed at 25 °C,
and each sample was tested three times in parallel.

Tensile-adhesion
measurements of PTFe hydrogels were performed
by a universal testing machine [(UTM), INSTRON 5583]. The substrates
such as PC, PMMA, nylon, glass, Ti, stainless steel (SS), and pork
skin tissue were commercially available. The engineered solid specimens
(25 mm × 100 mm × 1 mm) were washed with deionized water
and ethanol and then dried before use. The pork skin tissues were
cut into 25 mm × 25 mm squares and attached to aluminum fixtures
by using cyanoacrylate glue before the test.34 To adhere to the substrate, a hydrogel with 20 mm × 20 mm ×
1 mm was placed between two specimens and compressed with a 100 g
weight for 2 min. The adhered plates were clamped to the UTM and then
separated at a crosshead speed of 10 mm s–1. The
adhesion strength was calculated by the measured maximum load divided
by the bonded area. Each sample was tested five times in parallel.
