Simultaneous removal of NOx and SO2 by MgO combined with O3 oxidation
was studied.
The effects of the O3/NO molar ratio, oxidation temperature,
and oxidation residence time on N2O5 decomposition
and O3 consumption distributions were systematically illustrated,
which is of great significance for improving NOx removal efficiency and reducing O3 consumption
in practical application. When the O3/NO molar ratio was
greater than 1.0, the highest N2O5 yield was
achieved at 90 °C. The NOx removal
efficiency reached 96.5% at an O3/NO molar ratio of 1.8.
The oxidation temperature increased from 90 to 130 °C, resulting
in the decrease of N2O5 yield, the improvement
of O3-ICC (O3 invalid cycle consumption) caused
by N2O5 decomposition, and the decrease of NOx removal efficiency from 96.5 to 76%. Besides,
the effects of pH, SO2 concentration, and MgSO3 addition on NOx removal efficiency were
also investigated. The results showed that the removal efficiency
of NOx decreased with the increase of
SO2 concentration, while MgSO3 addition into
MgO slurry could promote the absorption of NO2 due to the
reaction between NO2 and SO32–.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are
recognized as the major pollutants causing
environmental problems,1,2 such as acid rain3 and photochemical smog. With the NOx emission standards becoming more and more strict, numerous
methods have been developed for NOx removal,4 such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR),5−8 activated carbon method,9−12 and ozone oxidation–absorption method.13−15 Among them, the ozone oxidation–absorption method has attracted
great interest because of its advantages of simultaneous removal of
SO2 and NOx with high efficiency
and low cost.

Huge emissions
of iron ore sintering flue gas from steel industry with high gas flow
amounts and low temperature (120–180 °C) are a great concern,
and many efforts have been devoted to the development of denitrification
technologies. In comparison to other denitrification strategies such
as SCR and activated carbon method, ozone oxidation–absorption
technology is more suitable because of its application temperature
and operation convenience. In the ozone oxidation combined with wet
flue gas desulfurization (WFGD),16,17 NO is oxidized
into NO2 or N2O5 by injecting O3 in front of the wet spray tower. Subsequently, NOx and SO2 in the spray tower are simultaneously
removed.18,19

The WFGD20−23 include limestone–gypsum,24−26 ammonia,27−29 MgO,30−32 and double-alkali methods.33 The magnesium base WFGD has been reported to possess various advantages,
such as low investment, high removal efficiency of SO2,
and high comprehensive utilization value of byproducts. Additionally,
it has been reported34,35 that MgO slurry reacts with SO2 in the spray tower to produce MgSO3, which promotes
NOx removal. Accordingly, it would be
feasible to use magnesium base WFGD combined with ozone oxidation
to accomplish the simultaneous removal of NOx and SO2 in flue gas.

In the ozone oxidation–absorption
technology, the removal
efficiency of NOx highly relies on the
composition of NOx (solubility in water:4 NO, 0.032 g/dm3; NO2, 213.0
g/dm3; N2O5, 500.0 g/dm3).36 Compared with NO2, N2O5 is easier to be removed in the spraying system
but needs more O3 for its generation.37,38 Wang et al.39 reported the reaction parameters
and kinetic mechanism for the generation of NO2 and N2O5 during the NO oxidation process. Sun et al.40 studied the effects of the pH value, initial
SO2 concentration, MgO concentration, and other operating
parameters on the NO2 removal efficiency. Shen et al.41 presented a novel magnesium-based WFGD process
in which sodium thiosulfate was used to inhibit the oxidation of the
desulfurization byproduct. However, these reports paid little attention
to the decomposition of N2O5 at high temperatures
and the consumption distribution of O3 during the whole
process. To study the decomposition of N2O5 and
the consumption distribution of O3 in the oxidation process,
it is beneficial to improve NOx removal
efficiency and reduce O3 consumption.

In this paper,
the effects of the molar ratio of O3/NO,
oxidation temperature, oxidation residence time, and adsorption operation
parameters (pH value, initial concentration of SO2, and
MgSO3 addition) on N2O5 yields and
denitrification efficiencies were studied. Additionally, the distribution
of O3 consumption during the whole process was particularly
concerned.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 N2O5 Yield and O3-ICC Ratio
2.1.1 Factors Influencing the N2O5 Yield
The solubility of N2O5 is much higher than those of NO and NO2, and the yield
of N2O5 greatly influences the absorption efficiency
of NOx. The molar ratio of O3/NO, the oxidation temperature, and the oxidation residence time
are the key factors to determine the N2O5 yield.
Considering the practical working conditions of the sintering process,
the oxidation residence time was chosen to be 1.2 s. The influence
of the O3/NO molar ratio and oxidation temperature on N2O5 yield was studied with the oxidation residence
time of 1.2 s, and the results were illustrated as Figure 1.

Figure 1 Yield of N2O5 under different O3/NO molar ratios and temperatures
(conditions: [NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500 ppm; [O2], 16%; gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min; and oxidation
residence time = 1.2 s).

It can be seen that N2O5 was
not formed when
O3/NO ≤ 1, and NO is gradually oxidized to NO2, as shown by R1. The reaction of R1 is very fast, and it is the main reaction step
when O3/NO ≤ 1.36,37 Further increase
of the O3/NO molar ratio led to the generation N2O5 yield, which was mainly ascribed to reactions as R2 and R3. R1   R2   R3  

For the oxidation temperature, a similar
phenomenon was observed
in our previous research.38 The results
showed that the N2O5 yield first increased and
then decreased with the increase of oxidation temperature, reaching
the highest value at 90 °C for all O3/NO > 1. When
the temperature of gas was higher than 90 °C, the N2O5 yield decreased very rapidly. Especially at 180 °C,
N2O5 generation was not detected. The decrease
of N2O5 at the high-temperature region (110–180
°C) was mainly ascribed to reactions of R4 and R5. Moreover, our previous research38 showed that O3 had strong oxidation
selectivity for NOx, the addition of SO2 had a little effect on N2O5 yield and
O3 consumption. R4   R5  

Oxidation residence time is also an
important factor influencing
the N2O5 yield in oxidation reaction. Herein,
the oxidation residence time was tested between 0.5 and 6.7 s to investigate
its correlation with N2O5 yield. Considering
the yield of N2O5, the operating cost, the O3 escape, and the O3/NO molar ratio was suggested
to be within the range of 1.5–2.0. Therefore, the O3/NO molar ratio of 1.8 was chosen. In Wang et al.’s research,39 the O3/NO molar ratio also chose
a similar value (1.75). As shown in Figure 2, for all five oxidation residence times,
the N2O5 yield decreased with increasing oxidation
temperature. In addition, the oxidation residence time had different
effects on the N2O5 yield at different oxidation
temperatures. When the oxidation temperature was 90 and 110 °C,
the N2O5 yield increased first and then decreased
with the extension of oxidation residence time, and the N2O5 yield reached the highest value at 2.5 s. When the
oxidation temperature was 130 and 150 °C, the N2O5 yield decreased as the oxidation residence time was prolonged.
These results indicated that choosing a reasonable oxidation residence
time at different oxidation temperatures is beneficial to promote
the formation of N2O5.

Figure 2 Yield of N2O5 under different oxidation residence
times and temperatures (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500 ppm; [O3], 360 ppm; [O2], 16%; gas flow
rate Q, 6 L/min).

2.1.2 Factors Influencing O3 Invalid
Cyclical Consumption
During the oxidation process, extra
O3 consuming processes include N2O5 decomposition, O3 decomposition, and reaction with SO2. In our previous research,38 it
was found that O3 hardly decomposed when the oxidation
temperature ranged from 90 to 150 °C, and SO2 hardly
consumed O3. Therefore, in this temperature range, the
research was mainly focused on the O3 extra consumption
caused by the decomposition of N2O5, regardless
of the decomposition of O3 and the O3 consumed
by the reaction with SO2.

N2O5 decomposition mainly generates NO2, especially at high
temperatures. The part of NO2 reacts with O3 to reproduce N2O5 again, leading to invalid
cyclical consumption of O3. In this process, the main reaction
is as R2, R3, R4, and R5. Hence, it is meaningful
to investigate the proportion of O3 extra wasted by invalid
cyclical consumption (O3-ICC), which was caused by N2O5 decomposition. Figure 3 showed the ratios of O3-ICC at
different temperatures, which were calculated based on the concentrations
of NO2, N2O5, and unreacted O3.

Figure 3 O3-ICC ratio under different O3/NO molar
ratios and temperatures (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500 ppm; [O2], 16%; gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min; and oxidation time = 1.2 s).

As shown in Figure 3, it was found that when O3/NO ≤
1, no O3-ICC appeared. The ratio of O3-ICC increased
with improvement
of temperature and O3/NO molar ratio when O3/NO > 1. For an O3/NO molar ratio of 1.8, the oxidation
temperature changed from 60 to 180 °C, and the O3-ICC
ratio was increased from 0 to 38%. The results indicate that O3 was all consumed to generate NO2, and no O3 was wasted when O3/NO ≤ 1; the decomposition
rate of N2O5 increased and consumed more O3 with increasing temperature when O3/NO > 1.
Moreover,
when the oxidation temperature was 180 °C, the decomposition
of O3 also consumed part of O3. These results
indicated that a lower oxidation temperature was beneficial to decrease
O3-ICC.

Subsequently, the effect of oxidation residence
time on the consumption
ratio of O3-ICC in the oxidation process was also studied
with the O3/NO ratio of 1.8 at 90, 110, 130, and 150 °C,
respectively. As summarized in Figure 4, the O3-ICC ratio increased with improvement
of oxidation residence time and temperature. When the oxidation residence
time was 0.5 or 1.2 s, O3-ICC was not observed at 90 °C.
Further increase of the oxidation temperature led to the dramatic
increase of the O3-ICC ratio. When the reaction temperature
was 130 °C, the O3-ICC ratio increased from 10 to
40% with oxidation time extension from 0.5 to 6.7 s. The experimental
results showed that longer oxidation residence time led to more N2O5 decomposition and higher O3-ICC ratio.
This phenomenon is more pronounced especially at high temperatures.

Figure 4 O3-ICC ratio under different oxidation residence times
and temperatures (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500
ppm; [O2], 16%; [O3], 360 ppm; gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min).

2.2 Removal Efficiency of NOx and the O3 Consumption Distributions
2.2.1 Removal Efficiency of NOx
After the oxidation process, the flue gas was introduced
into the spraying tower for absorption. As shown in Figure 5, for O3/NO ≤
1.0, the removal efficiency of NOx increased
with the improvement of the molar ratio of O3/NO, and different
oxidation temperatures led to little change of the NOx removal efficiency. When O3/NO was >1.0,
the NOx removal efficiency increased with
the increase of the molar ratio of O3/NO and decreased
with the improvement of the oxidation temperature. NOx removal efficiency increased from 43 to 97% with
the improvement of the O3/NO molar ratio from 1.0 to 1.8
at 90 °C. The NOx removal efficiency
increased from 43 to 76% when the molar ratio of O3/NO
was changed from 1.0 to 1.8 at 130 °C.

Figure 5 NOx removal efficiencies under different
O3/NO molar ratios and temperatures (conditions: [NO],
200 ppm; [SO2], 500 ppm; [O2], 16%; MgO slurry
concentration C, 0.05 mol/L; initial pH of slurry, 9.25; gas flow
rate Q, 6 L/min; and oxidation time = 1.2 s).

Studies revealed that when O3/NO ≤
1.0, the absorbed
NOx were NO and NO2, and NO2 was more easily absorbed than NO. Therefore, the removal
efficiency of NOx increased with the improvement
of O3/NO molar ratio. The oxidation products were NO2 and N2O5 when O3/NO >
1.0.
Considering N2O5 is more easily absorbed than
NO2, removal efficiency of NOx increases with the increase of the concentration of N2O5. With the improvement of oxidation temperature, the
decomposition of N2O5 was accelerated, and the
N2O5 yield decreased, and NOx removal efficiency accordingly decreased.

Besides, O3 is also an atmospheric pollutant, and whether
there is O3 escaping after absorption is a concern in the
industrial applications. Hence, the amount of O3 escape
after absorption was analyzed at different temperatures and molar
ratios. As shown in Figure 6, O3 escape gradually appeared in the absorbed
gas with the increase of the molar ratio. On the contrary, O3 escape decreased with the improvement of the oxidation temperature.
The oxidation temperature at 90 °C gave the highest O3 escape value. When the oxidation temperature was 180 °C, no
O3 escape was detected within the full range of the O3/NO molar ratio tested.

Figure 6 O3 escape under different O3/NO molar ratios
and temperatures (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500
ppm; [O2], 16%; MgO slurry concentration C, 0.05 mol/L;
initial pH of slurry, 9.25; gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min;
and oxidation residence time = 1.2 s).

The reason for the O3 escape was that
O3 was
not completely consumed in the oxidation reaction tube and the spray
tower. As the oxidation temperature increases, O3 is consumed
more in the oxidation reactor. Therefore, the O3 entering
the spray tower was reduced and the O3 escape was reduced.

The oxidation residence time has a significant effect on the N2O5 yield and thus on NOx removal efficiency. Hence, the corresponding research was conducted
with an oxidation temperature at 130 °C. As shown in Figure 7, extension of the
oxidation residence time led to the decrease of NOx removal efficiency when O3/NO > 1.0. At O3/NO = 1.8, the removal efficiencies of NOx were 96, 76, and 60% with the oxidation residence time being
0.5,
1.2, and 2.5 s, respectively.

Figure 7 NOx removal efficiencies
under different
O3/NO molar ratios and oxidation residence times (conditions:
[NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500 ppm; [O2], 16%; MgO
slurry concentration C, 0.05 mol/L; initial pH of slurry, 9.25; gas
flow rate Q, 6 L/min; and gas temperature T, 130 °C).

Meanwhile, reducing the oxidation residence time
will lead to increasing
the amount of O3 entering the spraying tower, thus affecting
the amount of O3 escape. Hence, O3 escape after
absorption was studied at different oxidation residence times and
O3/NO molar ratios. As shown in Figure 8, when the oxidation residence time was 0.5,
1.2, and 2.5 s, O3 began to escape with the O3/NO molar ratio increasing to 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5, respectively. The
results revealed that when the oxidation temperature was 130 °C,
shorter oxidation residence time led to less O3-ICC, suggesting
more O3 entering the spraying tower. In the spraying tower,
some O3 would be consumed, and the remaining unreacted
O3 would escape from the spraying tower.

Figure 8 O3 escape
under different O3/NO molar ratios
and oxidation residence times (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500 ppm; [O2], 16%; MgO slurry concentration
C, 0.05 mol/L; initial pH of slurry, 9.25; gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min; and gas temperature T, 130 °C).

2.2.2 O3 Consumption Distributions
In addition to the performance of desulfurization and denitration,
optimization of O3 consumption is also of great importance
in the ozone oxidation–absorption method. Great energy is consumed
during the O3 production process, and decreasing O3 consumption is a main strategy to reduce the operation cost
of the denitration device. In order to reduce O3 consumption,
it is necessary to establish an analytical method for O3 consumption distributions under different conditions and to verify
the influencing factors.

Based on the flue gas analysis after
oxidation and absorption, the O3 balance was calculated,
and the O3 distributions were classified into five parts
(Figure 9): after oxidation,
the product was generated as NO2 and N2O5, which could be analyzed at the outlet of the oxidation reactor.
The oxidation product NO2 corresponds to equimolar O3 consumption named as Part A. The oxidation product N2O5 corresponds to the O3 consumption
classified as Part B (excluding O3 consumption caused by
decomposition of N2O5). As described above,
some O3 is extra wasted in the invalid cyclical consumption
(O3-ICC), which was caused by N2O5 decomposition. Herein, O3-ICC was classified as Part
C. The remaining O3 enters into the spraying tower, and
many reactions occurred in the tower through complicated steps, such
as further oxidation of NO2 to generate N2O5, the oxidation of SO32– to produce
SO42–, the oxidation NO2– to produce NO3–, the
oxidation of NO which was released during the absorption of NO2, and so forth. It is very difficult to analyze every single
small part of O3 consumption for every reaction. Hence,
the O3 consumption in the spraying tower is defined as
Part D. At last, the O3 escaping from the spraying tower
was classified as Part E.

Figure 9 O3 combined with the MgO oxidation–absorption
process of the O3 consumption distribution schematic diagram.

After building the analytical method for O3 consumption
distributions, it was employed for the experiments conducted at 90,
110, 130, and 150 °C with the oxidation residence of 1.2 s and
a O3/NO molar ratio of 1.8. As shown in Figure 10, we found that the ratio
of Part A and Part C increased with increasing oxidation temperature,
while the ratios of Part B, Part D, and Part E decreased with increasing
oxidation temperature. For the oxidation temperatures of 90 and 110
°C, the largest percentage was Part B. For the oxidation temperatures
of 130 and 150 °C, the largest percentage was Part A. The ratio
of Part E was the least in all four oxidation temperatures. This indicated
that most O3 was consumed, with very few O3 escapes,
and even no O3 escape was detected at 130 and 150 °C.

Figure 10 Consumption
distributions of O3 in the process of magnesia
combined with O3 oxidation (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm;
[SO2], 500 ppm; [O2], 16%; [O3],
360 ppm; MgO slurry concentration C, 0.05 mol/L, gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min; and oxidation time = 1.2 s).

With the increase of oxidation temperature, the
decomposition rate
of N2O5 was accelerated, the yield of N2O5 decreased, and the concentration of NO2 increased. When the oxidation temperature changed from 90 to 150
°C, O3-ICC increased, and O3 entering the
spray tower to participate in the reaction decreased. Therefore, the
ratio of Part A and Part C increased and that of Part B, Part D, and
Part E decreased. These results indicated that oxidation temperature
is the key factor affecting O3 consumption distribution.

2.3 Effects of Operation Parameters on Desulfurization
and Denitrification
2.3.1 Effect of the pH Value
Figure 11 showed the efficiencies
in removing NOx and SO2 at
different pH values when the molar ratios of O3/NO were
1.0 and 1.5. The slurry was continuously circulated in the spraying
tower to absorb oxidized simulated flue gas.

Figure 11 NOx/SO2 removal efficiencies
under different pH values (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm; [SO2], 500 ppm; [O2], 16%; MgO slurry concentration C, 0.05
mol/L, gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min; gas temperature T, 130 °C, and oxidation time, 1.2 s).

It can be seen from Figure 11 that the pH value had little influence
on MgO’s
absorption of NOx, and the removal efficiency
fluctuation under different pH values was less than 5%. The trend
of NOx removal efficiency at different
pH values was similar when the molar ratio of O3/NO was
1.0 and 1.5. As the pH changed from 9 to 8, the NOx removal efficiency was lowered. However, the pH further decreased
from 8 to 4.5, the NOx removal efficiency
did not change. In addition, as shown in Figure 12, the removal efficiency of SO2 remains at 100% when the pH value was above 5.5. When the pH dropped
to 4.5, the removal rate of SO2 slightly decreased.

Figure 12 NOx removal efficiencies under different
SO2 initial concentrations (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm;
[O2], 16%; MgO slurry concentration C, 0.05 mol/L; initial
pH of slurry, 9.25; gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min; gas
temperature T, 130 °C, and oxidation time, 1.2
s).

N2O5 is easily absorbed,
so the decrease
of NOx removal efficiency at different
pH values is due to the decrease of NO2 removal efficiency.
It can be seen from following reaction R6 that the removal efficiency of NO2 was
related to the concentration of OH–. The concentration
of OH– decreased as the pH decreased and the NO2 removal efficiency decreased. As the pH drops further, SO32– converted to HSO3–. Both SO32– and HSO3– would react with NO2 in the slurry (R7 and R8). In this pH range
(8–4.5), the positive effects of HSO3– and the negative effects of OH– cancel each other
out, and the NOx removal efficiency did
not change with pH. R6   R7   R8  

2.3.2 Effect of Initial SO2 Concentration
In the practical industrial applications, the concentration of
SO2 contained in flue gas fluctuates greatly. Therefore,
it was necessary to study the initial concentration of SO2. Figure 12 studied
the effect of different initial SO2 concentrations on the
absorption of NOx by MgO.

As shown
in Figure 12, when
the molar ratio of O3/NO was 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, the removal
efficiency of NOx increased with the increase
of the initial concentration of SO2, but the degree of
increase was different. However, the NOx removal efficiency decreased when the molar ratio of O3/NO is 1.8. It was found that SO32– could
react with NO2, thus promoting the absorption of NOx (R7). The concentration
of SO2 in the flue gas component is usually greater than
that of NO2. Therefore, the concentration of NO2 largely determines the promoting effect of SO2 on NOx absorption. NO2 content in flue
gas: O3/NO molar ratio 1.0 > 0.5 > 1.5, SO2 on
the NOx absorption promotion effect decreased
in turn. At the same time, SO32– generated
by SO2 will consume O3 in the spraying tower
and reduce the reaction between O3 and NO2,
thus having a negative effect on NOx absorption
(R9). When the molar ratio of O3/NO was 1.8, the negative effect was more obvious. R9  

2.3.3 Effect of Magnesium Sulfite
It
has been reported31,35 that SO32– can react with NO2 to promote the absorption of NOx. Therefore, MgSO3 with different
concentrations was added to the MgO slurry to investigate its effect
on the removal efficiency of NOx. The
results are shown in Figure 13. It is shown in this figure that the increase of the MgSO3 concentration promoted the removal efficiency of NO2. If there was no MgSO3 in the slurry, the removal efficiency
of NO2 was 42.5%. While the MgSO3 concentration
increased to 100%, the removal efficiency increased to 79.5%. However,
the promotion of MgSO3 cannot be sustained. This is because
the SO32– ions in the slurry are consumed
by NO2 and O2 (R7 and R10). Therefore, as the concentration of MgSO3 increased, the time for promoting NOx removal efficiency was prolonged. R10

MgSO3 initial concentrations (conditions: [NO], 200 ppm;

gas flow rate Q, 6 L/min; gas temperature T, 130 °C, and oxidation time, 1.2 s).

3 Conclusions
The factors influencing
the denitrification performance of MgO
and the consumption distribution of O3 were studied, including
the O3/NO molar ratio, oxidation temperature, oxidation
residence time, initial concentration of SO2, pH value,
and addition of MgSO3. Oxidation temperature and residence
time affect N2O5 yield, O3 consumption
distribution, and NOx removal efficiency.
Under the conditions of the O3/NO molar ratio being 1.8
and oxidation residence time being 1.2 s, the highest N2O5 yield was achieved at 90 °C without O3-ICC consumption and the NOx removal
efficiency was 96.5%. When the oxidation temperature was improved
to 130 °C, the O3 consumption percentage corresponding
to NO2 was the largest, and the O3-ICC ratio
increased to 21.94%, and the NOx removal
efficiency decreased to 76%. Nevertheless, when the oxidation residence
time was shortened to 0.5 s, the O3-ICC ratio decreased
to 10%, and the NOx removal efficiency
increased to 95.5%. When the O3/NO molar ratio was 1.8,
improvement of the SO2 concentration led to the decrease
of the NOx removal efficiency, revealing
an inhibition effect. Besides, adding MgSO3 to the MgO
slurry can promote the absorption of NO2 due to the reaction
of NO2 and SO32–.

A schematic diagram
of the experimental setup for the simultaneous removal of NOx and SO2 using MgO slurry-combined ozone
oxidation is shown in Figure 14. The system included an ozone generator, gas supply system,

In this paper, cylinder gas (Beijing Hua Yuan Gas
Chemical Co.
N2, 99.999%; O2, 99.999%; NO, 1%, balanced with
N2; SO2, 2%, balanced with N2) is
used as the gas source, and the mass flow meter (Beijing Sevenstar
Electronics Co., Ltd.) is used to control the flow of simulated flue
gas. The flow rates of NO and SO2 were controlled at 120
and 150 mL/min (273.15 K and 1 atm.), respectively, and the flow rates
of N2 and O2 were controlled at 4770 and 960
mL/min (273.15 K and 1 atm.), respectively. The total gas flow was
6 L/min (273.15 K and 1 atm.).

The ozone was produced by the
Ozonia Lab2B generator using high-purity
oxygen (>99.999%) as the ozone source, which is based on the principle
of high-voltage discharge. The simulated flue gas is introduced into
the mixing heater and mixed with O3 and enters the reactor
for oxidation. The heating temperatures of the mixing heater are consistent
with that of the oxidation reactor, which are 60, 90, 110, 130, 150,
and 180 °C, respectively.

countercurrent slurry spraying tower is made of stainless steel with
a height of 400 mm and an inner diameter of 72 mm. On the top of the
tower, a single spraying nozzle (1/4 inch internal thread, 1.0 mm
aperture spraying nozzle, Dongpu Shagu Spray Co., Ltd.) is installed,
and the liquid–gas interaction distance is about 200 mm. The
simulated flue gas and slurry droplets enter the tower from the bottom
and top, respectively. MgO slurry is prepared using MgO (purity 98%,
Shanghai Aladdin Industry Co., LTD.) and deionized water, storing
in a 2 L three-necked, round-bottomed flask. The slurry is heated
and stirred with a heat-collecting magnetic heating agitator (DF-101S,
Jiangsu Jinqia Instrument Technology Co., LTD.). MgO slurry is introduced
into the spraying tower by a peristaltic Pump (BT100-2J, Longer Precision
Pump Co., Ltd.). The slurry is circulated between the spraying tower
and the three-necked flask with a concentration of 0.05 mol/L and
flow rate of 270 mL/min at 60 °C. In addition, the pH value of
the slurry was determined by a pH meter (FE20, METTLER-TOLEDO Co.,
Ltd.).

The concentration of NO, NO2, SO2, and O3 in front of and behind the spraying tower was
continuously
detected online by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker
Co., Ltd., Germany). When the molar ratio of O3/NO is greater
than 1, NO2 is further oxidized to N2O5, and two basic reactions occur, which including NO2 is
oxidized to NO3 and reaction of NO2 and NO3 to form N2O5, as shown by reaction
formulas R2 and R3.
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the
reaction rate constant K3 of R3 is far greater
than that of R2 (K2: 3.5 × 1017, K3: 2.2 × 1030, temperature: 25 °C). The NOx in the flue gas is mainly composed of NO2 and N2O5, and the NO3 content
is rarely. Therefore, we calculate the concentration of N2O5 by the conservation of nitrogen oxide.

4.2 Removal Efficiency
The NO2 yield is calculated by eq 1, the N2O5 concentration is calculated
by eq 2, and the N2O5 yield is calculated by eq 3, and [NO]a is
the reactor inlet NO concentrations; [NO2]b and [N2O5]b are the reactor outlet NO2 and N2O5 concentrations, respectively. 1   2   3  

The NOx and SO2 removal efficiencies are calculated by eqs 4 and 5, respectively. [SO2]a is the reactor inlet SO2 concentration, [NOx]c and [SO2]c are the spraying tower outlet NOx and SO2 concentrations, respectively.
The NOx in this paper only includes NO,
NO2, and N2O5, excluding other NOx (such as NO3 and N2O). 4   5  

4.3 O3 Consumption Distributions
The destination of O3 can be divided into five parts.
The ratio of O3 consumption distribution can be calculated
by eqs 6–10. Because of the N2O5 decomposition,
extra O3 was wasted by invalid cyclical consumption (O3-ICC). [O3]a is the
reactor inlet O3 concentration, [O3]b is the reactor outlet O3 concentration,
[O3]c is the spraying tower
outlet O3 concentration. 6   7   8   9   10
