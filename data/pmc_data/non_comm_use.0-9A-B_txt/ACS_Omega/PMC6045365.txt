The
present study investigates polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production
from lignin and its derivatives by a previously reported lignin-degrading
bacterial strain Pandoraea sp. ISTKB.
PHA production was screened by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry
using a Nile red stain. PHA and biomass accumulation, while screening,
was found to be maximum on 4-hydroxybenzoic acid followed by p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and
kraft lignin after 96 h. Monomer composition was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) and was followed by Fourier transform
infrared and 1H NMR analysis, indicating PHA to be a copolymer
of P(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate). Genomic
analysis of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB also
complemented the results of GC–MS and NMR, and the relevant
genes responsible for the synthesis of small chain length PHA were
discovered in the genome. Process parameters were optimized by response
surface methodology for enhanced production of PHA and biomass on
4-hydroxybenzoate. Optimization results showed 30 and 66% increase
in the biomass and PHA production, respectively. The results obtained
were promising and indicated that if lignin is depolymerized into
low-molecular-weight intermediates, then it can easily be utilized
and converted into value-added products like PHA by microbes.

Introduction
Polymers derived from
petroleum sources are nonbiodegradable, and
as a result, these are accumulated in the environment as landfills
or in water bodies. Their dumping leads to health hazards and further
intensifies the problem of their disposal. Finite petroleum resources,
climate change, and concern toward environment compelled us to search
renewable alternatives for fuel and chemicals. Polyhydroxyalkanoate
(PHA) can be a potential replacement of petroleum-based plastics because
of its biodegradability and biobased, carbon neutral, nontoxic, and
environment friendly nature. It is estimated that a complete substitution
of a petroleum-based polymer with PHA can possibly reduce greenhouse
gas emission and fossil energy use by 200 and 95%, respectively.1,2

PHA is a group of biopolyesters having more than 150 different
monomers synthesized as granules inside cells by various microorganisms.
Microbes accumulate PHA as carbon and energy reserve material under
stress and nutrient imbalance conditions, that is, in the presence
of the excess carbon source followed by limiting nitrogen, phosphorous,
or oxygen in the medium.3−5 They are linear polymers of hydroxyl
fatty acid monomers. The PHA synthesis occurs by the concerted action
of genes such as 3-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, and PHA
polymerase or by diverting fatty acid metabolites into PHA synthesis
pathways with the help of several enzymes. The PHA metabolism is carried
out by the action of numerous enzymes, and the genes responsible for
PHA metabolism are tightly regulated.4,6

The physical
and mechanical properties of PHA are comparable to
polyalkenes-based plastic, and their properties can be controlled
by choice of microbial strain, carbon source, and fermentation conditions.
On the basis of the number of carbon atoms present in the monomer,
PHA is classified as short chain length (Scl, C3–C5) and medium
chain length (Mcl, C6–C14).5 Bacteria
can also produce a mixed copolymer of Scl or Mcl or Scl–Mcl
by feeding on a mixed or complex substrate. Production of copolymers
provides scope for further improvement in the properties of PHA. PHA
has got several applications in various sectors, such as packaging,
plastic processing, cosmetics, food and agriculture, medical, and
biomaterials, as a precursor for fuel and chemicals.4,6,7

PHA production at an industrial
scale grew rapidly after years
of research with limited success, despite its market share being still
very low. The main reasons are high production cost, high price, and
policy framework. Raw materials used for production constitute about
50% of the total production cost, and the carbon source constitutes
70–80% of the total raw material’s cost.8 Utilization of lignocellulosic biomass as renewable raw
materials is the main focus nowadays because of their abundance, low
cost, and easy availability.9 Lignocellulosic
biomass-based biorefineries utilize cellulose and hemicellulose while
lignin is discarded as waste. Lignin is recalcitrant to degradation
with very limited usage, that is, combustion in the paper industry
and precursor generation for vanillin and dimethyl sulphoxide synthesis.10−13 Recently, a smart composite material for packaging was produced
from lignin and PHA having viscoelastic and gas barrier properties.14 Closing the loop by utilizing the waste generated
from biorefinery and industry will validate the model of circular
economy. Intense research is needed to develop new processes for conversion
of lignin into value-added products for sustainable biorefinery.11 Fungi and bacteria can degrade lignin in the
natural environment. They secrete various enzymes such as oxidases
and peroxidases to degrade lignin into various aromatic intermediates.15 Aromatic intermediates were further degraded
and utilized by bacteria through peripheral and central pathways with
the concerted action of various enzymes for growth.10,16

The present study investigates screening, characterization,
and
optimization of PHA production by a previously reported lignin-degrading
bacterium Pandoraea sp. ISTKB while
growing on lignin and its derivatives. Genomic analysis was performed
to identify the relevant genes responsible for PHA metabolism and
substrate utilization.

Results and Discussion
Screening for PHA Accumulation
on Lignin and Its Derivatives
A lignin-degrading bacterial
strain Pandoraea sp. ISTKB was screened
for PHA accumulation. This strain has been
studied earlier for lignin degradation and sugarcane bagasse pretreatment.12,17 The genome sequence has also been reported, and analysis indicated
the presence of genes responsible for degradation of lignin and its
derivatives.16 For PHA production, this
strain was cultured aerobically on kraft lignin and various lignin
derivatives such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, or syringol as
carbon sources followed by incubation at 30 °C, pH 8, and 185
rpm, under nitrogen limitation for six days. Microbes tend to accumulate
PHA inside the cell as carbon and energy reserve under nutrient imbalance
conditions. Bacterial growth, dry biomass, and PHA content were monitored
at regular intervals for all substrates under investigation.

Fluorescence microscopy was performed to establish the PHA accumulation
property by staining the cells with Nile red.18 The cells harvested after 96 h were stained with Nile red and visualized
under a confocal microscope. The cells displayed strong orange red
fluorescence indicating accumulation of lipid or PHA granules inside
cells as shown in Figure S1. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed to further confirm
granule accumulation inside cells. The TEM image visibly showed the
PHA granules accumulated inside the Pandoraea sp. ISTKB as depicted in Figure S2. This
strain was cultured under nitrogen-free, nitrogen-limited, and nitrogen-excess
media, and results indicated that higher PHA was accumulated under
the nitrogen-limited condition.

The biomass and PHA accumulation
increased with time from 0 to
96 h and was found to be 4-HBA (523 mg/L; 246 mg/L), p-coumaric acid (417 mg/L; 170 mg/L), vanillic acid (215 mg/L; 72
mg/L), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (200 mg/L; 69 mg/L), and least by kraft
lignin (86 mg/L; 18 mg/L) as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The percent
accumulation of PHA observed was 47, 33, 35, 41, and 21% of cell dry
mass for 4-HBA, vanillic acid, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, p-coumaric acid, and kraft lignin, respectively. There was a slight
decrease in the biomass and PHA content measured on 120 h (Figure 2). A decrease in
fluorescence was observed at 120 h which may be due to the metabolic
recycling of PHA as a carbon and energy source. The p-coumaric acid degradation pathway leads to formation of intermediate
4-HBA, and it can be inferred from the results that biomass as well
as PHA accumulation decreases in the case of p-coumaric
acid because of complexity in the structure. Thus, lignin needs to
be depolymerized before it can be utilized efficiently by microbes.

profile and quantification of biomass accumulation measured
after 24 h for six days on different carbon sources 4-HBA, vanillic
acid (VA), p-coumaric acid (PCA), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
(DMP), and KL by Pandoraea sp. ISTKB.
The experiment was performed in triplicate.

(VA), p-coumaric acid (PCA), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
(DMP), and KL estimated after 48, 96, and 144 h. The experiment was
done in triplicate.

4-HBA was found to be
the preferred substrate for biomass and PHA
production by Pandoraea sp. ISTKB.
The biomass and PHA production profile obtained by gravimetric analysis
was further confirmed by flow cytometry after staining cells with
Nile red cultured on 4-HBA for six days. The mean fluorescence intensity
was found to be in accordance with the PHA production profile, and
maximum fluorescence was detected in the 96 h sample as depicted in Figure 3a,b. Flow cytometry
analysis indicated that the accumulation of PHA in Pandoraea sp. ISTKB started from the beginning of
growth and strongly followed the growth pattern.

The graph shows mean fluorescence intensity with respect to time.

Production of PHA from genus Pandoraea has not been explored, and there is only
a single report available
on PHA production from crude glycerol by this organism. There are
very limited reports available on PHA production from lignin and its
derivatives. PHA accumulation reported by Oceanimonas
doudoroffii was less than 3% on all lignin and its
derivatives tested; however, p-coumaric acid and
vanillate significantly inhibit the cell growth.13Ralstonia eutropha H16 was
grown on 18 lignin derivatives, and among these, only 3-HBA, 4-HBA,
2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid showed poly-3-hydroxybutyrate
(P3HB) production. The growth and PHA accumulation was not observed
on vanillate and p-coumaric acid.15 Compared to the above-reported strains, Pandoraea sp. ISTKB can utilize p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, and other derivatives with a greater
ease. A study reported a PHA content of 34 and 32% on p-coumaric acid and alkaline-pretreated liquor (APL), respectively,
by Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which
is less compared to the present study.10

Salvachúa et al.19 reported
that
screening of PHA accumulation using fluorescent microscopy and flow
cytometry from APL by P. putida KT2440, P. putida mt-2, Cupriavidus necator, Ralstonia jostii, and Amycolatopsis sp. was found to be 52, 60, 168, 288,
and 13 mg/L, respectively. Among the tested strains mentioned above,
only C. necator and R. jostii showed higher PHA accumulation than Pandoraea sp. ISTKB on kraft lignin. Also, APL is
a favorable substrate for growth compared to kraft lignin. Production
of PHA from kraft lignin has been recently reported from Cupriavidus basilensis B-8 and was found to be 15–18.5%.20 Production of biomass by C. basilensis B-8 was observed to be higher on kraft lignin (KL), but the PHA
accumulation percentage was lower compared to Pandoraea sp. ISTKB; this is possibly due to the higher initial inoculum size.
This is the first report available so far of PHA production from lignin
and its derivatives by the genus Pandoraea. These findings clearly indicated that if lignin can be converted
to low-molecular-weight intermediates (4-HBA, vanillate, and p-coumaric acid), then bacteria can efficiently synthesize
PHA by utilizing these derivatives.

Confirmatory Analysis of
PHA Production
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to identify the functional
groups present in the PHA polymer extracted from Pandoraea sp. ISTKB. The FTIR spectrum was scanned in the range of 4000–400
cm–1, and the graph of the polymer is represented
in Figure S3. Characteristic bands of the
PHA polymer were observed in the FTIR spectrum. The band around 3436
cm–1 (O–H stretching vibration) indicated
the presence of the hydroxyl group in the polymer.12 Spectra observed around 2970 cm–1 denotes
asymmetric methyl stretching, and this CH3 stretching can
form interaction with the carbonyl (C=O) group and union of
C–H–O.5 The band at 2921
cm–1 signifies the asymmetric methylene (CH2) group and is responsible for lateral chain formation of
monomeric units. The intense band observed around 1721 cm–1 is the marker band of the polymer, and it represents carbonyl (C=O)
stretching vibration of ester bonds. The presence of the amide group
[amide I (−CO–N−) carbonyl stretching vibration
and amide II (N–H) bending vibration] near 1650 and 1462 cm–1 was observed.21 These
signals would have appeared because of interference while extraction
by bacterial intracellular components and also from protein-coated
PHA granules. The signal of terminal CH3 present in the
polymer can be traced at 1380 cm–1. Various prominent
signals observed between 1400 and 600 cm–1 were
assigned to C–O–C, C–O, C–H, and C–C
vibrations.5,21 Hence, it can be inferred from
the functional group analysis that the extracted polymer is PHA.

Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis
was performed to characterize the monomeric composition present in
the extracted polymer accumulated by Pandoraea sp. ISTKB. The presence of 4 and 5 carbon monomers, that is, 3-hydroxybutanoate
(3HB) and 4-hydroxyvalerate (4HV), was observed. The total ion chromatogram
(TIC) and the electron ionization mass spectrum are depicted in Figure S4. Peaks obtained at retention time (10.205
and 13.207) and 16.283 were identified as 3HB and 4HV, respectively,
and the percent area acquired by these peaks in TIC is 36.38 and 6.85%,
respectively. The major monomer constituent of the PHA polymer is
3HB followed by 4HV. The characteristic ionic mass fragmentation pattern
of 3HB and 4HV, that is, m/z 87,
59, 117, 115, 101 and 131 were detected.3,22 The analysis
of the fragmentation pattern indicated the presence of 3HB and 4HV
components in PHA.

The monomeric composition of extracted and
purified polymers was
further analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). The spectrum of 1H NMR of the PHA copolymer (HB-co-HV) has been depicted in Figure 4. The resonance signal indicated the presence
of different types of protons surrounding the carbon atom. The resonance
signals around 1.25–1.43 and 0.83–0.89 ppm designates
the presence of methyl group proton (CH3) in HB and HV.
The existence of methylene proton (CH2) in PHA monomers
gives multiple resonances around 1.58, 1.68, and 2.17–2.64
ppm. Multiple resonances around 5.24–5.28 ppm showed the presence
of the methane proton in PHA and PHV.23−25 The signals obtained
are similar to the earlier report of pure P(HB-co-HV) polymers.24,25 The results indicate synthesis
of the heteropolymer by Pandoraea sp.
ISTKB. Production of a similar copolymer P(3HB-co-3HV) from crude glycerol plus propionic acid by Pandoraea sp. MA03 has been reported recently.3 Production of the 4HV monomer from C. necator ATCC 17699 on levulinic acid and Cupriavidus sp. USMAA2-4 on γ-valerolactone has been reported earlier.26,27

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is the most common and
extensively studied
polymer having properties similar to petroleum-based plastics, but
its high crystallinity and less flexibility limit its application
range. These undesired properties can be improved by incorporation
of co-monomers with PHB such as HV, 4-hydroxybutanoate (4HB), or hydroxyhexanoate
(HHx) to form copolymers. Synthesis of copolymer P(HB-co-HV) by this strain will take care of limitations and provide stiffness
with flexibility to PHA. PHA synthesized from lignin and its derivatives
by different strains was reported recently. PHA synthesized from 4-HBA
by O. doudoroffii was a copolymer of
P(HB-co-HV), and a similar polymer was obtained from Pandoraea sp. ISTKB on 4-HBA.13 The PHA synthesized by R. eutropha H16 on 4-HBA was the homopolymer P3HB.15 The PHA monomer composition obtained on kraft lignin by C. basilensis B-8 was the heteropolymer of C4 carbon,
that is, R3HB, 3HB, and S3HB, but Pandoraea sp. ISTKB produced C4 and C5, that is, R3HB, 3HB, and 4HV.20 Analysis of PHA by GC–MS, FTIR, and 1H NMR indicated the presence of the copolymer P(HB-co-HV).

Genomic Analysis of PHA Metabolism and Substrate
Utilization
We have earlier reported the genome sequence
of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB (accession number: MAOS00000000.1), and the important genes related to lignin or aromatic compound
degradation as well as stress, and the detoxification mechanism has
been highlighted.16 However, the genes
responsible for PHA synthesis have not been reported earlier. After
screening and characterization for PHA production, we further analyzed
the genome of this strain for the identification of candidate genes
responsible for PHA synthesis. The various genes responsible for PHA
synthesis were identified in the genome, and the predicted genes have
been shown in Table S1. The PHA synthesis
genes identified in the genome are responsible for short chain length
PHA production (C3–C5). The absence of enzyme (R)-3-hydroxyacylACP: CoA transacylase (PhaG) in Pandoraea sp. ISTKB genome limits the synthesis of medium or long chain PHA.28 There are several copies of important genes
discovered in the genome related to the Scl PHA metabolism such as
8 of 3-ketothiolase (acyltransferase), 5 acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase,
12 acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (dehydrogenase), 3 PHA synthases, 15
enoyl CoA hydratase, and one copy each of phasin (PHA-granule-associated
protein), PHA synthesis repressor PhaR, and PHA depolymerase. Other
relevant genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis, degradation, and
fatty acid transporters are also annotated in the genome. 3-Ketothiolase
performs the first reaction by condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules
or acetyl CoA and propionyl CoA to form intermediates that undergo
reduction into 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA or 3-ketovaleryl-CoA by the action
of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase followed by their polymerization into
the P(HB) or P(HB-co-HV) polymer by PHA synthases.26 The 3-hydroxyalkanoate synthetase (locus tag
A9762_23655) belongs to class III, PHA polymerase (A9762_13630) and
PHB polymerase (A9762_18785) to class I. The PHA polymerase and PHB
polymerase showed 40 and 32% identity with poly(3-hydroxyalkanoic
acid) synthase (class II) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, which needs to be further investigated. The genomic analysis
of PHA metabolism genes further validated the results of GC–MS
and NMR. The presence of two PHA synthases has also been reported
in the genome of beta proteobacterium R. eutropha H16 and Cupriavidus baseliensis B-8,
but one additional PHA polymerase was observed in the genome of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB that needs to be studied further.20,29 There is only one report available on PHA production by Pandoraea genus from glycerol plus propionic acid,
but the genes responsible for PHA production was not studied.3 We report for the first time about the important
genes responsible for PHA production in genus Pandoraea.

Because we observed the growth and PHA production maximum
on 4-HBA, we looked into the genome for the identification of candidate
genes responsible for 4-HBA metabolism. We discovered six 4-HBA transporters
and one 4-hydroxybenzoate monooxygenase gene that would have directly
facilitated in utilization of 4-HBA by Pandoraea sp. ISTKB. The microorganisms that belong to the Burkholderiaceae
family are known to be metabolically versatile. The genomic and functional
analysis of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 while growing on 4-HBA showed that 4-HBA can be funneled through
both protocatechuate and gentisate central pathways.30 This bacterium contains both protocatechuate and gentisate
central pathways and also belongs to the Burkholderiaceae family that
further supports this strain’s potential for efficient utilization
of 4-HBA, but this needs to be functionally validated in Pandoraea sp. ISTKB.

Process Optimization by
Response Surface Methodology
In the screening experiments,
lignin and its derivatives were tested
as a carbon source for biomass and PHA production. It was found that
4-HBA, a degradation product of lignin, was most suitable, and hence
it was selected for further experiments. To maximize the biomass and
PHA production, various process parameters (carbon content, pH, and
duration) were optimized using Box–Behnken design (BBD). Other
process parameters such as nitrogen content, rpm, inoculums size,
and temperature were kept constant throughout the experiment. The
result of 17 experiments designed according to the BBD for maximizing
biomass and PHA production is given in Table 1.

Statistical
Analysis and Interactive Effects of Factors on Responses
The data of the 17 experiments were analyzed by analysis of variance
(ANOVA), and results are given in Table S2 for biomass and PHA. The F value of the model is
the ratio of the mean square value and residual mean square values
of model coefficients. The significance of the model and its coefficients
as well as mutual interactions was determined on the basis of p values. The smaller the p value, the
more significant is the corresponding regression. p value less than 0.05 indicates that the model term is significant
at the 95% confidence limit.

The model for the prediction of
biomass has lack of fit (F value) 273.59 and p value < 0.0001 (Table S2). Thus, the model is statistically significant and lack of fit is
insignificant. There is only a 12.86% chance that an F value (3.50) this large could occur because of noise. The p values given in Table S2 show that B (4-HBA), C (duration),
A2 (pH × pH), B2 (4-HBA × 4-HBA),
C2 (duration × duration), and BC (4-HBA × duration)
model terms are significant. 4-HBA content (p <
0.0001) and the duration of the experiment (p <
0.0001) strongly influenced biomass production. The multiple correlation
coefficient, r2 (also known as the coefficient
of determination), is 0.99. This implies that the model can explain
99% variation in response. Thus, this model can be used to navigate
the design space.

The results given in Table S2 indicated
that the model is statistically significant for PHA also with F value 416 and p value < 0.0001. Lack
of fit (F = 2.26; 22.38%) for the model is insignificant.
The p values given in Table S2 show that B (4-HBA), C (duration), AB (pH × 4-HBA), BC (4-HBA
× duration), A2 (pH × pH), B2 (4-HBA
× 4-HBA), and C2 (duration × duration) model
terms are significant for response 2, that is, PHA content. 4-HBA
content (p < 0.0001) and the duration of the experiment
(p < 0.0001) strongly influenced PHA production.
The multiple correlation coefficient, r2, is 0.99; therefore, this model can be used for predicting optimum
values for 4-HBA content, pH, and duration. For both biomass and PHA,
the amount of 4-HBA and the duration of the experiment were more important
than pH of the culture media. 4-HBA content and the duration were
the most important interaction for both biomass and PHA. Correlation
analysis of biomass and PHA content obtained after prediction experiments
are strongly and positively correlated (r2 = +0.95).

Confirmatory Experiment
The conditions
suggested by
the model are pH (7.99), 4-HBA concentration (3.6 g/L), and duration
(111.44 h). The optimum conditions for the production of biomass and
PHA are shown in Figure S5. The expected
yield for biomass is 671 mg/L and for PHA is 399 mg/L. Confirmatory
experiments were done in triplicate. The biomass production was 682
± 17 mg/L, and PHA content was 409 ± 12 mg/L. The maximum
percent accumulation was 60 ± 2%. The results of confirmatory
experiments are in good agreement with the values predicted by the
model. Variables parameters and responses before and after optimization
have been shown in Table 2. After optimization, bacterial biomass increased by 30% and
PHA content by 66% as compared with screening experiments. In screening
experiments, maximum biomass (523 mg/L) and PHA (246 mg/L) were produced
at 96 h using 4-HBA as a substrate. The maximum percent accumulation
during screening was 47% which increased to 60% after optimization.
The increase in PHA content was mainly due to the increase in biomass
as well as increased percent accumulation. Few studies have used bacterial
strains for PHA production using lignin or its derivatives.15 Biomass production in the case of R. eutropha H16 was similar to that in our study
with PHA accumulation of 63 ± 2%. Biomass production and PHA
production were very low in the case of P. putida JCM 13063 and P. putida Gpo1.15 Another study compared PHA accumulation by two-step
cultivation of O. doudoroffii with
lignin and its derivatives as a sole carbon source. In this study,
the biomass production on 4-HBA was comparable (620 mg/L), but PHA
accumulation was very low 0.8%.13 Optimization
of process parameters to maximize PHA content has yielded varied results
with the increase in PHA content as low as 11%31 to as high as 100%.32 In this
study, optimization of the process increased PHA content by 66%, thereby
making the process more robust and economically feasible.Table 2 Value of Biomass and PHA Content after

The
findings highlight the application
of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB in conversion
of lignin and its derivatives such as 4-HBA into a value-added product,
that is, PHA. 4-HBA-rich wastewater stream from industries (that depends
on 4-HBA as a substrate for production of antiseptics, polymers, preservatives,
and pesticides) can be utilized for the PHA production using this
strain. The PHA production result obtained after optimization under
flask conditions is promising. Taking clue from the initial flask-level
optimization results, the PHA production can be further improved in
a bioreactor where each and every parameter can be monitored in real
time and the limiting factors can be identified and further optimized.

ISTKB (accession no. KM609459) was examined for PHA production under shake flask
conditions.12 The composition of mineral
medium (MM) for PHA production contains the following (g/L): 6.78Na2HPO4; 3KH2PO4; 0.5NaCl; 2
mL/L 1 M MgSO4; 0.13(NH4)2SO4; 0.1 mL/L 1 M CaCl2; 1 mL/L trace metal solution
consisting of (g/L): 0.15FeSO4·7H2O; 0.1ZnSO4; 0.3H3BO3; 0.006CuSO4; 0.020NiCl2·6H2O; 0.030Na2MoO4·2H2O; and 0.25MnCl2·2H2O. A seed culture
of 250 mL was prepared by inoculating a single colony of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB in a lysogeny broth (LB) and
cultured overnight at 30 °C. The LB culture was centrifuged,
washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then used to
inoculate the 500 mL flask containing 150 mL MM (nitrogen limiting)
supplemented with different carbon sources in triplicates, that is,
4-HBA (2 g/L), p-coumaric acid (2 g/L), kraft lignin
(2 g/L), vanillic acid (2 g/L), and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol or syringol
(2 g/L). The flasks were inoculated having a final optical density
of ∼0.06 at 600 nm measured using a spectrophotometer (Cary
100 Bio UV–visible). Cultures were incubated at 30 °C
and 185 rpm for 6 days. Appropriate volumes of samples were drawn
periodically for further analysis.

Screening for PHA Accumulation
PHA accumulation in Pandoraea sp.
ISTKB was visualized by staining the
cells with Nile red using confocal microscopy. An appropriate volume
of culture was harvested postinoculation at different time intervals
(i.e., 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h), and cells were pelleted
by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellets
obtained were washed twice with PBS and processed further for microscopy
as described earlier.10 The cell pellets
were also processed for TEM to visualize the PHA granules accumulated
inside the cells as described earlier.32 The sample was visualized on TEM 2100F (JEOL, Japan) at 120 kV.

PHA accumulation within the cell was evaluated by staining the cells
with Nile red and assayed using flow cytometry (FACS; Beckman Coulter,
MoFlo Cytomation). An appropriate volume of culture was harvested
at different time points, centrifuged, and washed twice in PBS. The
cells were stained with 0.15 mg/mL Nile red dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide and incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature.
Then, the cells were washed twice in PBS and loaded into FACS for
Nile red fluorescence measurement using 488 nm laser coupled with
610/20 nm detection. A histogram was generated by recording 20 000
events for each sample. A change in the intensity of fluorescence
with time indicates the presence and the amount of PHA within cells.

Extraction and Characterization of PHA
For cell biomass
and PHA extraction, the cultures were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. Cell pellets were processed for cell
dry mass and PHA content as described previously.32 The functional group composition of extracted PHA was studied
by FTIR. A thin pellet was prepared and scanned as described earlier.12

The chemical structure of PHA was analyzed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy using a Varian Mercury Plus NMR
spectrometer. The extracted and dried PHA was dissolved in deuterated
chloroform (CDCl3; chloroform is toxic and proper precaution
was taken during experiments) at a concentration of 10 mg/mL with
tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. The 400 MHz 1H NMR spectrum was recorded at 10 330.578 Hz, with a pulse
width of 3.17 s, 45.2° pulse angle, recycle delay of 1 s, and
16 scans.

GC–MS was used to study the monomeric composition
of the
polymer. The composition of PHA was analyzed by methanolysis of dried
cells with a solution of 2 mL chloroform, 0.3 mL of 98% sulfuric acid,
and 1.7 mL methanol heated at 100 °C for 140 min to convert the
constituents into methyl esters. Then, the reaction mixture was allowed
to cool at room temperature followed by the addition of 1 mL water
to induce phase separation. The lower chloroform layer was used for
GC–MS analysis as described earlier.32

Genomic Analysis for PHA Production and Substrate Utilization
The genome of Pandoraea sp. ISTKB
was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and the raw reads
were filtered to obtain high-quality filter reads and assembled into
scaffolds as described earlier.16 Genes
and pathways were annotated from the draft genome using NCBI prokaryotic
genome annotation pipeline, Pfam, and KEGG automatic annotation server.16 The important genes known for PHA metabolism
and degradation of lignin and its derivatives were further identified.

Optimization of Media Components for Biomass and PHA Production
The optimization was performed by Design-Expert version 10 using
response surface methodology. The variable carbon concentration, duration,
and pH were selected as factors for optimization of maximum biomass
and PHA production, keeping inoculum size, temperature, nitrogen content,
and shaking condition constant. BBD was used for optimization of three
independent parameters (carbon concentration, pH, and duration) at
three levels (minimum, medium, and maximum). On the basis of the experimental
design suggested by the software, seventeen experiments were conducted
with carbon concentrations (1, 3, and 5 g/L), pH (6, 8, and 10), and
duration (48, 96, and 144 h) to obtain the maximum response for bacterial
dry biomass (mg/L) and PHA content (mg/L). The experimental design
suits a quadratic response surface, and it generated a second-order
polynomial regression model. The equation is given below 1  where y is the predicted
response, βo is the intercept, Xi and Xj are independent variables, βi is ith linear coefficient, βij is interaction coefficient, βii is ith quadratic coefficient,
and ε is the random error term. This equation was used to fit
the experimental data of 17 experiments. The data obtained after experiment
were evaluated statistically using ANOVA (p <
0.05). Confirmatory experiments were performed at the predicted parameters,
and the responses obtained after analysis were compared with the predicted
values to confirm the validity of the model.
