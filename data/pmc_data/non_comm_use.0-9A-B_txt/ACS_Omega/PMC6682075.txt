Joint prosthesis failure is mainly
related to aseptic loosening
and prosthetic joint infections, both associated with high morbidity
and a substantial cost burden for patients and health systems. The
development of a biomaterial capable of stimulating bone growth while
minimizing bacterial adhesion would reduce the incidence of prosthetic
failure. Using an in vivo rabbit model, this study evaluates the osseointegration
effect of the fluorine (F)- and phosphorus (P)-doped bottle-shaped
nanostructured (bNT) Ti-6Al-4V alloy and effectiveness of monitoring
urine aluminum concentration to determine the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in Ti-6Al-4V implants.
Unlike chemically polished (CP) Ti-6Al-4V alloy implants, bNT Ti-6Al-4V
alloy implants promoted osseointegration and showed effectiveness
as a biomaterial marker. The bNT Ti-6Al-4V alloy implants were associated
with a twofold increase in bone thickness and up to 15% greater bone
density compared to the CP alloy. Additionally, bNT Ti-6Al-4V alloy
implants allowed for discrimination between P. aeruginosa-infected and noninfected animals for 15 days postoperatively, as
indicated by the decrease of aluminum concentration in urine, while
this difference was only appreciable over the first 7 days when CP
Ti-6Al-4V alloy implants were used. Therefore, bNT Ti-6Al-4V alloys
could have clinical applications by detecting the infection and by
avoiding aseptic loosening.

1 Introduction
Joint prostheses are one
of the most important medical advances
in history; however, they are not free from failure; the main causes
of their negative outcomes are aseptic loosening, infection, dislocation,
and prosthesis or bone fracture.1

Aseptic loosening accounts for up to 30% of all surgical interventions
for revision of hip and knee prostheses.2 The main causes of aseptic loosening are loss of fixation caused
by inadequate initial tissue-implant fixation, mechanical loss of
fixation over time, and particle-induced osteolysis around the implant.3 However, proper osseointegration may prevent
aseptic loosening caused by these factors.4

Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is an infrequent (1–2%
of all cases) but dreaded complication, because of high morbidity
and substantial costs which they cause.5 The most frequently isolated microorganisms from these infections
are Gram-positive cocci, which represent up to 77% of all infections
(mainly staphylococci).6 Gram-negative
bacilli can be isolated from 3 to 45% of infections,7 and Enterobacteriaceae (mainly Escherichia coli) is the main group of species isolated,6 though nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli such
as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are gaining
in importance because of the challenge they pose for treatment.7b,8 In fact, P. aeruginosa has raised
special concern of late owing to its strong association with nosocomial
infection and high propensity for development of antibiotic resistance.

Titanium (Ti) alloys, particularly Ti-6Al-4V, are commonly used
in dental and orthopedic implants because of their favorable tribological
properties and biocompatibility.9 These
alloys are widely accepted to be “inert” inside the
human body from the physicochemical point of view, as they are covered
with a thermodynamically stable layer of titanium oxide, a continuous,
highly adherent, protective, and self-repairing material. However,
all metal implants undergo degradation in the human body because of
at least four fundamental phenomena: leaching, wear, corrosion,10 and the synergystic phenomenon arosen from the
last two,11 tribocorrosion. Corrosion and
wear are the most widely studied factors in medical-use alloys. Corrosion
studies of Ti-6Al-4V implants in patients have revealed elevated levels
of Ti and normal levels of aluminium and vanadium in the serum or
urine of carriers of a prosthesis made with this alloy, a finding
which is related to aseptic loosening.12 Other studies, on the other hand, have reported that the release
of Ti, aluminium, and vanadium in rabbits with implants made of this
alloy may be independent of wear or loosening,11,13 with these metals reaching detectable levels even when osteosynthesis
material is used.13,14 To date, no study has analyzed
the possible relationship between the release of ions from the Ti-6Al-4V
alloy and occurrence of PJI.

In previous studies, F-doped the
Ti-6Al-4V alloy revealed that
the fluorine (F)-content is the responsible for reducing staphylococcal
adherence by about 50%15 and microbial
biofilm development.16 Furthermore, it
is known that phosphorus (P)-doped Ti alloy favors the osteointegrative
properties of this alloy.17 Thus, by using
together both ions, an anti-adherent and osteoinductive material could
be obtained. F- and P-doped bottle-shaped nanotubular (bNT) oxide
layers of Ti-6Al-4V alloy18 were obtained
by the anodizing process and evaluated at microbiological and cellular
levels.19 Despite bNT layers releasing
aluminum (Al) from the inside of the nanostructure and the resulting
ions being captured by P. aeruginosa, this biomaterial is noncytotoxic and displays improved osteoblastic
proliferation, mineralization, and differentiation in vitro.19 Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate
the osseointegration of the F- and P-doped bottle-shaped nanostructured
Ti-6Al-4V alloy and to monitor of urine aluminum concentration as
a biomaterial marker of P. aeruginosa infection in Ti-6Al-4V implants in an in vivo rabbit model.

2 Results
2.1 Histopathologic and Microbiological
Studies
The results of the histopathologic examination are
shown in Table 1. The
presence of
nonlaminar bone was significantly superior in bNT Ti-6Al-4V implants
without infection than in CP Ti-6Al-4V without infection (p = 0.0389).

Three types of bone
response to the implants were observed (Figure 1): nonexisting osseointegration
(Figure 1a), complete
osseointegration (Figure 1b), and partial osseointegration (Figure 1c). Only one implant made of CP Ti-6Al-4V
showed total absence of osseointegration (Figure 1a). The osseointegration results was obtained
for the presence of five or more osteoblasts per 10 HPF; the formation
of nonlamellar bone and formation of laminar bone did not allow any
type of statistical inference between infected and noninfected groups
(Table 1).

Bone remodeling was significantly
higher in bones placed with bNT
Ti-6Al-4V implants (9/10) than in CP Ti-6Al-4V implants (5/10) (p = 0.025) (Table 1). Bone remodeling in infected joints was equal between both
materials (p = 1.000).

A high rate of acute
and chronic osteomyelitis was detected in
infected samples with either type of implant (CP Ti-6Al-4V, 8/10 with
acute osteomyelitis and 2/10 with chronic osteomyelitis; bNT Ti-6Al-4V,
7/10 with acute osteomyelitis and 3/10 with chronic osteomyelitis).
The proportions of both types of osteomyelitis were equal in both
materials when infection with this bacterium was induced (p = 0.303).

The bone surrounding the implants of both
materials in this experimental
procedure showed no signs of metallosis, neither macroscopic nor microscopic.

The results of microbiological studies showed no significant differences
between implant types concerning the amount of bacteria isolated from
bone and andexa on the one hand and the infected implant on the other
(p > 0.05) (Figure 2). Interestingly, we observed a tendency toward greater
bacteria isolation in infected bNT Ti-6Al-4V implants than in their
respective bones when compared to the CP Ti-6Al-4V implants.

test between the groups with P. aeruginosa infection (Pa11).

2.2 Monitoring
Levels of Aluminum in Urine
The levels of Al detected in
the control animals (without implant)
over a 15 day monitoring period were statistically normal, and their
average value (±standard deviation) was 23.13 ± 14.72 ng/mL.
Over time, the mean levels of Al in urine were very similar between
animals with the same type of implanted material and lower in those
that had infection induced by P. aeruginosa (Figure 3a,b). The
results obtained from monitoring the levels of Al in urine (ng/mL)
of intervened rabbits showed that animals with Ti-6Al-4V implants
had higher urine Al levels than nonintervened animals (control group)
(Figure 3a,b gray area);
in addition, P. aeruginosa-infected
animals had lower Al levels than animals without infection. No clear
trend in these levels was observed over time in either of the experimental
groups. However, when a mixed-effect linear regression model was applied
to the total daily Al concentration in the urine of each animal, a
trend was observed in infected animals implanted with either material
(p = 0.089 for CP Ti-6Al-4V and p = 0.054 for bNT Ti-6Al-4V), and a nonsignificant relation was seen
between the infected animals and between noninfected animals with
both materials (p > 0.05). If all Al concentrations
are considered as independent observations, there were significant
differences between all experimental groups (p =
0.002 for Kruskal–Wallis test) (Figure 3e), specifically between the CP Ti-6Al-4V
group and CP Ti-6Al-4V + Pa11 group (p < 0.001)
and between the bNT Ti-6Al-4V group and bNT Ti-6Al-4V + Pa11 group
(p = 0.019). There were no significant differences
between the groups without infection (p = 0.7873)
or between the groups with P. aeruginosa infection (p = 0.9726). The linear mixed-effect
regression model applied to the weight of the animals (Figures 3c and 4d) showed that weight gain increased over time, though without any
significant difference between the experimental groups (p > 0.05). From this, it can be deduced that weight gain is not
significantly
different between the different experimental groups over time, which
suggests that the Al coming from diet is the same in all groups and
that the variations in Al levels are due only to the Al released by
the implant.

This infection model for urine monitoring also
revealed foci of
osteomyelitis in the proximal femoral diaphysis, with foci of myelitis
found in the distal diaphysis of two out of every three animals in
which P. aeruginosa infection was induced
(Figure 3f). In spite
of this, there were no significant differences between implants infected
with P. aeruginosa in terms of the
amount of bacteria isolated from the proximal shaft (p = 0.5127) and from the distal shaft (p = 0.3758).

2.3 Computerized Microtomography Studies
The
results of the computerized microtomography studies are shown
in Figure 4. This figure
shows the new bone grown around the CP Ti-6Al-4V implant (Figure 4a) and around the
implant of bNT Ti-6Al-4V (Figure 4b), together with their respective three-dimensional
views of the femur samples obtained by micro-CT. The mean new bone
thickness was significantly higher in the bone grown around bNT Ti-6Al-4V
than CP Ti-6Al-4V implants (p = 0.0007) (Figure 4c). Furthermore,
the mean relative bone density was slightly higher in the bone grown
around bNT Ti-6Al-4V than CP Ti-6Al-4V implants (p < 0.0001) (Figure 4d).

2.4 Bone Aluminum Detection
As can be
seen in Figure 5, the
Al detected in new growth bone was very scarce and located in the
periphery of the bone and at the implant–bone interface for
both kinds of implant (Figure 5a,b). The positive and negative were positive and negative,
respectively (Figure 5c,d).

3 Discussion
In this study, we report
the in vivo osseointegration ability of
the F- and P-doped bNT structure. Use of the bNT Ti-6Al-4V alloy caused
qualitative and quantitative improvement of the in vivo osseointegration
of the implant compared to the alloy CP Ti-6Al-4V. We further show
that monitoring of total Al levels in the urine of the animals used
in the in vivo rabbit model during the first days postoperatively
enabled discrimination between animals infected with P. aeruginosa and animals with no infection.

The bone in contact with the surface of the prosthesis undergoes
morphological remodeling almost immediately after the intervention.
This remodeling of mature periprosthetic bone in osseointegrated prostheses
is confirmed by the presence of medullary spaces containing osteoclasts,
osteoblasts, mesenchymal cells, and lymphatic/blood vessels next to
the surface of the prosthesis.20 The proportion
of bone samples with bone remodeling and with presence of nonlaminar
around bNT Ti-6Al-4V implants was significantly higher than the proportion
of bone remodeling of CP Ti-6Al-4V implants (p <
0.05). The histological results were backed up by the results of computerized
microtomography studies which showed that the relative bone density
and thickness of new periprosthetic bone are significantly higher
(p < 0.001) in bNT Ti-6Al-4V than in CP Ti-6Al-4V,
with a 15% greater relative bone density and up to twice the thickness
of new periprosthetic bone (Figure 4). Thus, the F–P-doped Ti oxide layer grown
onto the T-6Al-4V alloy by anodizing is a surface modification treatment
that can be used to other osseointegrative treatments based on coatings
such as pectin21 and nanofibrous polymers22 and other osseointegrative and anti-infective
surface modifications based on graphene oxide/Ag/collagen23 and Ag/ZnO incorporated hydroxyapatite.24

P. aeruginosa has a propensity
to
adhere to fibro-cartilaginous and osseous joint structures and has
been associated with osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and, less frequently,
PJI.8,25 The cellularity around both materials did
allow a distinction to be made between acute and chronic osteomyelitis
in most of the infected animals during the surgical intervention.
This is the first study to highlight the release of one of the alloying
elements of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, aluminum (Al), relating this phenomenon
to P. aeruginosa infection. Release
of this element has been reported in different studies performed in
patients with prostheses made from this alloy.11,12,14,26 The levels
of Al released in patients with this type of alloy are higher in those
tissues immediately adjacent to the prosthesis or implant: in descending
order, these are the interface membrane, joint capsule, synovial fluid,
urine, and blood.12c,27 According our results of bone
Al detection, Al released from implants was lightly retained by the
Ti-6Al-4V implant–bone interface membrane in both CP and bNT
but not in the new growth bone (Figure 5). These findings are consistent with what other authors
have affirmed.12c,27 As our experimental model is
based on an intramedullary implant in the femur of each animal, when
Al is released from the implant, it is incorporated into the bone
through three mechanisms: heteroionic exchange with calcium, magnesium,
and phosphate on the bone surface; as precipitation during bone mineralization,
along with calcium and phosphate; and via coupling with nonmineralized
bone tissue biomolecules, such as glycosaminoglycans, acid glycoproteins,
and acidic bone matrix proteins such as phosphoproteins.28 The part of the Al that is retained on the bone
surface by heteroionic exchange or binding to the organic molecules
may pass into blood circulation, where it is captured by a serum and
cellular component. The fraction of Al incorporated in the mineralized
part of the bone is susceptible to mobilization by osteoclasts during
remodeling and bone absorption.28 This
mobilized Al can be excreted, mainly via the urinary system, or deposited
again by any of the aforementioned mechanisms. If accurate, this physiological
mechanism would justify the detection of this metal in the urine in
all animal implant carriers of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy.

The Al levels
detected in the control animals (without implants)
can only come from water and food ingested,29 whereas the Al in the animals with a CP Ti-6Al-4V implant comes
in addition to water and food from leaching, wear, corrosion,10 and/or tribocorrosion. Surface treatments allow
passive layers to grow in certain metallic biomaterials that reduce
the dissolution rate and, therefore, the corrosion of the metal.30 The anodizing treatment used in this work promotes
the growth of an amorphous oxide layer on the surface of the alloy
that increases its chemical stability and decreases corrosion, thereby
lowering the levels of metal ions released into the physiological
medium12c,13 while favoring the incorporation of other
anions from the anodizing bath.18 However,
Al was also found in the urine of the animals implanted with the bNT
Ti-6Al-4V. This Al3+ is not only the product of corrosion
but also the result of the release of the cation retained inside the
bottle-shaped nanotubes after the anodizing process.19 The urine of P. aeruginosa-infected animals had lower Al levels than their noninfected counterparts.
It had previously been shown that P. aeruginosa is capable of capturing a limited amount of Al released from bNT
Ti-6Al-4V in vitro through an irreversible uptake mediated by pyochelin.19 Here, our results obtained in vivo show that
this P. aeruginosa ability is maintained
in the in vivo model using bNT Ti-6Al-4V but further show that the
difference between P. aeruginosa infection
and noninfection was also detectable when Al levels are monitored
in animals with CP Ti-6Al-4V implants. Animals with CP Ti-6Al-4V implants
and P. aeruginosa infection had lower
Al levels during the first 7 days, whereas animals with bNT Ti-6Al-4V
implants and P. aeruginosa infection
showed lower levels during at least the first 15 days compared to
other animals with the same material and without P.
aeruginosa infection.

This experimental model
has certain limitations when it comes to
extrapolating the in vivo results in rabbits to humans. First, the
presence or absence of infection can only be determined when the microorganism
associated with PJI is P. aeruginosa. However, preliminary in vitro results suggest that other nonfermenting
bacteria and certain Gram-negative fermenting species may be detected
by applying this experimental model,19 although
more studies are needed to corroborate these in vivo results. Second,
quite often, P. aeruginosa is at least
one of the two bacterial species involved in polimicrobial PJI,7b,8b,31 for that more studies will be
necessary for establishing the utility of these results. Third, exposure
to Al is higher and more variable in our species than in other experimental
animals used because of contributing factors such as hygiene (e.g.,
use of cosmetics)32 and nutritional33 behaviors as well as demographic and geographic
conditions. As a result, this exposure should be also considered before
using this monitoring method. Fourth, bNT Ti-6Al-4V alloy may not
be used in patients with kidney failure34 because Al excretion is mainly via the urinary system29a and more studies are necessary to evaluate
possible Al toxicity on organs and systems (liver, kidneys, hears,
nervous systems, etc). Fifth, because bNT Ti-6Al-4V roughness is almost
threefold higher than that of CP Ti-6Al-4V, it cannot be exclude the
possible and positive effect that roughness exert on osteointegration.35 Sixth, it should be necessary to evaluate the
bNT layers using an in vivo model that allows testing biomechanically
to confirm that the new bone formed around these implants is normal
and actually improves the mechanical stability of the implant.

In conclusion, this is the first study to evaluate the osseostimulatory
effect of the bNT Ti-6Al-4V alloy while testing the potential of urine
Al concentration as a possible implant biomarker when a Ti-6Al-4V
implant is infected by P. aeruginosa. Unlike similar alloys produced using CP, bNT Ti-6Al-4V both increased
the relative bone density and thickness of the new bone grown around
this material and also enabled discrimination between P. aeruginosa-infected and noninfected animals over
the first 15 days after surgery.

4 Methods
4.1 Sample Preparation
The alloy bars
were prepared from 3 mm diameter Kirschner wires supplied by DePuy
Synthes (Johnson & Johnson, Massachusetts, Estados Unidos). Each
bar was cut into nails measuring 20 or 40 mm in length. Next, these
were chemically polished (CP) according to the methodology previously
described15 (Figure 6a). The roughness of the CP Ti-6Al-4V samples
used ranged between 50 and 70 nm.19

Bottle-shaped TiO2 nanotubes (bNT) were prepared by anodization
according to the methodology previously described18 (Figure 6b,c). The physicochemical
characterization of the bNT nanotubes has been carried out in previous
studies.9b,18,36 The bNT average
pore diameter are ∼47–67 nm for the mouth/bottom of
the pores.18 The roughness of the bNT Ti-6Al-4V
samples ranged between 150 and 170 nm.19

4.2 Surgical Procedure and Monitoring of Animals
This study was approved by the Instituto de Investigación
Sanitaria de la Fundación Jiménez Díaz (IIS-FJD)
Animal Care and Use Committee, which includes ad hoc members for ethical
issues. Animal care and maintenance complied with institutional guidelines
as defined in national and international laws and policies (Spanish
Royal Decree 53/2013, authorization reference PROEX111/16 December
28, 2016, by the Ministry of the Environment, Local Administration
and Territorial Planning of the Community of Madrid and, Directive
2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of September
22, 2010).

Specific pathogen-free New Zealand white male rabbits
(Granja San Bernardo, Navarra, Spain) between 2.5 and 3 kg of weight
were used. All animals were individually housed in individual cages
in an air-conditioned room at 22 ± 2 °C and cycles of light-darkness
of 12:12 h.

In this in vivo model, we used a P. aeruginosa strain isolated from an 80 year-old
woman with an infection of spinal
osteosynthesis material (Pa11) in the Clinical Microbiology department
of the Fundación Jiménez Díaz University Hospital.

The surgical intervention of the in vivo model was based on the
model previously described by Cordero et al.37 Above the drilled hole, 100 μL of 0.9% NaCl physiological
saline was injected with or without a total concentration of 106 CFU of bacteria obtained from Pa11. Subsequently, each cylinder
of Ti-6Al-4V was implanted in accordance with the group to which each
animal was assigned until the implant was flushed with the joint surface.
To reduce the number of animals used, both femurs of each animal were
intervened, leaving 1 week between operations because animals do not
tolerate implantation well in both femurs in a single surgery (Figure 7a). Each animal received
two implants of the same kind of material and same treatment. No differences
were detected between both legs despite the temporal difference, in
a similar way to other authors.21,37

Figure 7 Radiographies of the
surgery rabbit models in this work: 20 mm
long implant and one implant per femur (a) and 40 mm long implant
and one implant per animal (b).

We used 20 rabbits with femoral implants distributed into
four
groups: one group with a CP Ti-6Al-4V implant without infection (CP
Ti-6Al-4V group), a second group with a CP Ti-6Al-4V implant with
infection induced by Pa11 P. aeruginosa (CP Ti-6Al-4V + Pa11 group), third group with an implant of bNT
Ti-6Al-4V without infection (bNT Ti-6Al-4V group), and a fourth group
having an implant of bNT Ti-6Al-4V with infection induced by P. aeruginosa (bNT Ti-6Al-4V + Pa11 group).

Four weeks after the second surgery, each animal was euthanized
under general anesthesia by intracardiac overdose of sodium thiobarbital.
The rabbit femurs were recovered through sterile preparation of the
hip, surgical field isolation, and by following the approach described
for the primary surgery.

4.3 Pathologic and Microbiological
Processing
of Samples
The periprosthetic bone was longitudinally divided
into two samples using chisel and hammer on a sterile surface per
sample.

Histological sections were fixed, decalcificated, paraffin-infiltrated,
and hematoxylin–eosin stained. The osseointegration reaction
was evaluated by classifying the specimens as complete, partial, or
nonexistent osseointegration. Complete osseointegration was established
as the formation of a complete structure of bony trabeculae around
the implant, whether from woven-immature or mature-laminar bone, with
scant interface membrane remaining. Partial osseointegration was defined
as focal bone formation with unossified areas, with the interface
membrane still occupying half of the periprosthetic tissue, whereas
the absence of osseointegration was taken to be the absence of bone
formation, with all periprosthetic tissue being the interface membrane.
Bone remodeling was evaluated in a binary manner based on the presence
of remodeling cellularity (osteoblasts and osteoclasts) in the newly
formed trabeculae closest to the implant and the presence of laminar
or nonlaminar bone. Within osteomyelitis, a distinction was made between
acute and chronic infection in the entire bone according to the criterion
previously described.38

For microbiological
studies, the bone and the implant were separately
immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (Biomérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile,
France) and sonicated using an Ultrasons-H 3000840 low-power bath
sonicator (J.P. Selecta, Barcelona, Spain) at 22 °C for 5 min.39 The resulting sonicate was diluted in a 10-fold
dilution bank and seeded on blood-chocolate agar (Biomérieux,
Marcy-l’Étoile, France) using the spread plate method.
The concentration of bacteria was estimated as CFU/g of bone and adnexa
or as CFU/cm2 of implant.

4.4 Monitoring
the Levels of Aluminum in Urine
For this study, the same
experimental procedure previously described
was performed, albeit with the modifications described below. For
better monitoring of Al levels in the urine of the animals, some rabbits
underwent surgery only once, using 40 mm long nails of each material
and were infected with a bacterial inoculum of 200 μL of solution
with a 107 CFU/mL concentration of Pa11 (Figure 7b). At least 1 mL of urine
per animal was collected by means of nonforced urination from day
0 until the day of euthanasia.

Total Al concentration in the
urine was estimated by atomic adsorption in a graphite furnace at
Reference Laboratory (Barcelona, Spain). We used 14 animals placed
with femur implants and distributed them into five groups (including
the above-mentioned ones): CP Ti-6Al-4V group, CP Ti-6Al-4V + Pa11
group, bNT Ti-6Al-4V group, bNT Ti-6Al-4V + Pa11 group, and a fifth
group composed of two animals without an implant and without infection,
used as controls to establish baseline levels of Al in the rabbits’
urine. The entire femur was removed from each animal, and the proximal
and distal femoral diaphyses were analyzed separately at pathological
and microbiological level.

4.5 Computerized Microtomography
Studies
The fixed samples were scanned with an in vitro micro-CT
device (Nikon
160 XTH). The scanning parameters were as follows: 139 kV, 52 μA,
1000 projections, exposure 708 ms/frame, average of 4 frames per projection,
and a 0.25 mm copper filter with 1.5 h of scanning time. X-ray projection
reconstructions were made with MyVGL (see 3.1 Volume Graphics, Heidelberg,
Germany). Two parameters were estimated with this software: mean thickness
of new bone and mean relative bone density. Mean new bone thickness
was estimated from two measures on the same plane of the new bone
grown around the implant (10 measures on 10 planes covering at least
1 cm per bone sample). The mean relative bone density was estimated
from the coefficient of the mean of three measures of gray level in
the peri-implant new bone and mean of three measures of denser cortical
bone gray shade from each plane (10 measures of new-grown bone closest
to the implant on 10 different CT slides chosen at random covering
at least 1 cm per bone sample).

4.6 Aluminum
Detection in Bone
One fixed
sample of bone from each group, the CP Ti-6Al-4V alloy, and bNT Ti-6Al-4V
alloy were included in the EpoFix resin Kit (Struers ApS, Ballerup,
Denmark), cut, and sanded to a thickness of 30–40 μm.
The presence of Al in bone was determined using the staining procedure
described by Walton et al.40 The Walton
histological method stains aluminum that is covalently bound to tissue
components but also forms a complex with the carboxylate group of
the phoxine dye, which leads to a stable intracellular magenta-colored
appearance visible to the optical microscope.40 Under ultraviolet light, the sensitivity of the method improves
further, and the stained aluminium at the surface can be easily discriminated
from other stained features.40 The positive
control was performed using a rabbit femur drilled and injected with
200 μL of 1 mg/mL of AlCl3 in SS without an implant.

4.7 Statistical
Statistical analyses
were performed using Stata Statistical Software, Release 11 (StataCorp
2009). First, the normality of each series of data was checked with
the Shapiro–Wilk test.

Pathological results were evaluated
using the comparation of two proportions between groups.

Microbiological
and computerized micrography results were evaluated
using the one-sided Wilcoxon nonparametric test that was applied to
compare two groups of data, while the Kruskal–Wallis test was
used when there were more than two groups.

We compared the Al
in the urine of each animal each day, and weight
gain was compared through a unilateral mixed-effect regression model.
In each experimental group, the rate of excretion was estimated every
24 h by calculating the product of the concentration of Al (ng/mL),
the average amount of urine (62.5 ± 12.5 mL/kg),29b and the average weight of each group per day.

A level of statistical significance of p ≤
0.05 was considered significant. All data are represented as mean
and standard deviation for statistically normal results and as median
and interquartile range for statistically non-normal results.
