Thermite, a composite
of metal and metal oxide, finds wide applications
in power and thermal generation systems that require high-energy density.
Most of the researches on thermites have focused on using aluminum
(Al)
particles as the fuel. However, Al particles are sensitive to electrostatic
discharge, friction, and mechanical impact, imposing a challenge for
the safe handling and storage of Al-based thermites. Silicon (Si)
is another attractive fuel for thermites because of its high-energy
content, thin native oxide layer, and facile surface functionality.
Several studies showed that the combustion properties of Si-based
thermites are comparable to those of Al-based thermites. However,
little is known about the ignition properties of Si-based thermites.
In this work, we determined the reaction onset temperatures of mechanically
mixed (MM) Si/Fe2O3 nanothermites and Si/Fe2O3 core/shell (CS) nanothermites using differential
scanning calorimetry. The Si/Fe2O3 CS nanothermites
were prepared by an electroless deposition method. We found that the
Si/Fe2O3 CS nanoparticles (NPs) had a lower
reaction onset temperature (∼550 °C) than the MM Si/Fe2O3 nanothermites (>650 °C). The onset temperature
of the Si/Fe2O3 CS nanothermites is also insensitive
to the size of the Si core NP. These results indicate that the interfacial
contact quality between Si and Fe2O3 is the
dominant factor for determining the ignition properties of thermites.
Finally, the reaction onset temperature of the Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs is comparable to that of the commonly used Al-based
nanothermites, suggesting that Si is an attractive fuel for thermites.

Introduction
Thermite is an energetic composite of
metals as fuels (e.g., Al,
B, and Si) and metal oxides as oxidizers (e.g., CuO, Fe2O3, and WO3). Once ignited, thermite releases
a large amount of heat and thus finds applications, ranging from aerospace
propulsion, thermal batteries, waste disposals, and power generation
for microsystems to material synthesis.1−4 Most of the researches on thermites
have focused on using aluminum (Al) as the fuel.5−11 However, Al, especially Al nanoparticles (Al NPs), is sensitive
to electrostatic discharge, friction, and mechanical impact,12 imposing a challenge for the safe handling and
storage of Al-based thermites. In addition, Al particles have a native
oxide layer of 2–6 nm, which acts as a dead mass.13 Among other fuels such as red phosphorus14 and boron,15,16 silicon (Si)
is another attractive fuel for thermites because it has high volumetric
and specific energy densities (75.1 MJ/L and 32.2 MJ/kg, respectively)
similar to those of Al (83.8 MJ/L and 31.0 MJ/kg, respectively). Si
also has a thinner native oxide layer of 1–3 nm than Al,17 and it is resistant to electrostatic discharge.
Importantly, the surface of Si can be easily functionalized,18,19 facilitating the use of coating and surface modification to tailor
its ignition and burning properties. Several previous studies have
shown that Si-based thermites have comparable combustion properties
as Al-based thermites,18,20,21 in terms of adiabatic combustion temperatures (∼3000 K) and
burning rates (40–530 m/s).22 However,
little is known about the ignition properties of Si-based thermites
and their dependence on the structure of thermites.

Herein,
we study the ignition properties, in terms of reaction
onset temperatures, of Si and Fe2O3 thermite
mixtures. The reason for choosing Fe2O3 as the
oxidizer is that Al/Fe2O3 is one of the most
studied thermite systems.23 Moreover, the
thermite reaction between Si and Fe2O3 (3Si
+ 2Fe2O3 → 3SiO2 + 4Fe, 12.9
MJ/kg of Si) has the least amount of gaseous byproducts among thermites,20 allowing us to focus on the structural effect
on the oxygen diffusion process that is critical to ignition. In particular,
we compared the reaction onset temperatures of Si/Fe2O3 core/shell (CS) particles with those of the mechanically
mixed (MM) Si/Fe2O3 powders (Figure 1). We found that the Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs had a lower reaction onset temperature
(∼550 °C) than the MM Si/Fe2O3 nanothermites
(>650 °C). These results indicate that the interfacial contact
quality between Si and Fe2O3 is the dominant
factor for determining the ignition properties of thermites, a phenomenon
similar to that in Al-based thermites.3 Finally, the reaction onset temperature of the Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs is comparable to that of the commonly used Al-based
nanothermites, suggesting that Si is an attractive fuel for thermites.

Figure 1 Schematics
of (a) MM and (b) CS Si/Fe2O3 thermites.
The improved contact between Si and Fe2O3 in
the CS structure facilitates the oxygen diffusion process and hence
lowers the reaction onset temperature.

We investigated the ignition properties of Si/Fe2O3 nanothermites by using Si NPs of two different sizes
(20–30
nm, US Research Nanomaterials, and 100 nm, Skyspring Nanomaterials
Inc.). The oxygen content of these particles is summarized in Table 1. Overall, the oxygen
content of both sizes of Si NPs is negligible. The MM Si/Fe2O3 samples (Figure 1a) were prepared by dispersing 100 mg of Si and 380.2 mg of
Fe2O3 into 10 mL of hexane, followed by sonication
for 30 min and drying on a hot plate at 100 °C. The Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs (Figure 1b) were prepared by coating Si with an Fe2O3 shell using an electroless deposition method.24 As schematically illustrated in Figure 2a, the Si particles were first
coated with a Pd layer through electrostatic plating. Then, Pd was
replaced by Fe through electroless plating. The formed Si/Fe NPs were
converted to Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs by thermal annealing.
The detailed synthesis process is described in the Methods section.

Results and Discussion
The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images in Figure 2b–e show the representative
morphologies of the initial Si particles (Figure 2b,c, average diameter: 100 nm) and the final
coated Si/Fe2O3 NPs (Figure 2d,e). The surface of the initial Si particles
is smooth (Figure 2c), and it becomes rather rough after the synthesis (Figure 2e), indicating a successful
coating. SEM inspection over a wide range of samples shows that the
surface of the Si particle is coated with a shell. The coating of
Fe2O3 over the Si surface is also confirmed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDXS) mapping. It should be noted that the SEM images
were taken for the 100 nm
Si NPs because of the spatial resolution limit and that the TEM images
were taken for 20–30 nm Si particles for better electron transmission.
Both the TEM and standing TEM (STEM) images (Figure 3a,b) suggest that the final particle has
a CS structure. The EDXS element mapping of the boxed regime in Figure 3a shows the coexistence
of strong Fe element and O element signals and relatively weak Si
signals, indicating that a layer of Fe2O3 has
been deposited on the surface of Si. However, because the initial
sizes and shapes of Si particle have an inherent distribution, it
is difficult to determine the exact thickness of iron oxide. Instead,
we have estimated the Si/Fe2O3 equivalence ratios
using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy
(Thermo Scientific ICAP 6300 Duo view spectrometer) system. The estimated
equivalence ratios of 20–30 nm and 100 nm Si/Fe2O3 CS particles are 24.1 ± 0.15 and 6.07 ± 0.02,
respectively. In addition, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis of the Si/Fe2O3 CS NP in Figure 3f shows the characteristic
iron oxide peaks (Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, 711.4
and 724.2 eV, respectively), confirming the shell chemical composition
of Fe2O3. Finally, the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis of both the Si/Fe2O3 CS and MM NPs
shows the characteristic peaks of Si and Fe2O3 (Figure 3g). The
above characterizations indicate that we have synthesized Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs.

boxed region in (a);

in (a); (f) XPS spectra; and (g) XRD in comparison with that of Si/Fe2O3 MM NPs. These characterizations confirm the
formation of Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs.

Next, we used differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) to determine
the reaction onset temperatures of Si/Fe2O3 CS
NPs and compare with those of the MM NPs. Figure 4 shows the representative baseline-corrected
DSC profiles of Si/Fe2O3 CS and MM samples with
two different sizes of the Si particle. First, the onset temperature
of the Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs is about 550 °C,
which is about 100–150 °C lower than that of the MM samples.
This confirms that the CS structure has more facile oxygen diffusion
process because of its better interfacial contact between Si and Fe2O3. Second, the onset temperature of the 20 nm
Si/Fe2O3 (MM) is about 50 °C lower than
that of the 100 nm Si/Fe2O3 (MM), confirming
the importance of size effect. A smaller size NP has a larger specific
surface area and a shorter diffusion distance for oxygen, and both
factors contribute to the lower onset temperature. By contrast, the
onset temperature of the 20 nm Si/Fe2O3 (CS)
is about the same as that of the 100 nm Si/Fe2O3 (CS), indicating that intimate interfacial contact between Si and
Fe2O3 in the CS structure has already effectively
minimized the oxygen diffusion length. Hence, the initial size of
the Si NP plays a negligible role here. In other words, the reaction
onset temperature of Si/Fe2O3 nanothermites
is mostly affected by their interfacial contact quality.

Figure 4 Baseline-corrected
DSC traces of Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs and MM samples
for two different initial sizes of Si particles
(20 and 100 nm).

Finally, we compared
the reaction onset temperatures of our Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs with those of Al/metal oxide nanothermites
in the literature. We chose the Al/metal oxide nanothermites that
have comparable Al size with our Si NPs for fair comparison, and the
results are listed in Table 2. It is clear that Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs have
comparable reaction onset temperatures as other Al/metal oxide nanothermites
(460–580 °C). These data suggest that replacing Al with
Si in thermites will have little change in terms of reaction onset
temperatures.

Conclusions
We have shown that the easy surface functionality of Si allows
a facile synthesis of Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs using
a simple electroless plating method. The formed Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs have a reaction onset temperature of about 550 °C,
which is about 100–150 °C lower than that of the MM samples.
The lowering of the reaction onset temperature is caused by the enhanced
intermolecular oxygen diffusion processes in the CS structure. In
addition, the reaction onset temperature of the Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs is comparable to that of the commonly used Al-based
nanothermites. Considering the easy surface functionalization property
and comparable ignition properties, our study suggests that Si is
another attractive fuel for thermites. Our synthesis methodology can
be applied to form a diverse range of Si/metal oxide thermites for
tailored applications.

Methods
Synthesis of Si/Fe2O3 CS NPs
First, 100 mg of Si NPs was
dispersed into 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol
and sonicated for 15 min to break up the Si particle clusters. (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES, 1 mL, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 mL of Milli-Q water were
sequentially added to the Si NP solution and stirred at 70 °C
for 1 h to functionalize the surface of Si with APTES. Second, the
functionalized Si NPs were washed with deionized (DI) water and collected
by centrifugation, and then, they were immersed in 40 mL of palladium
chloride aqueous solution (20 mg of PdCl2, Sigma-Aldrich,
and 0.1 mL of reagent grade 37% HCl, Fisher Scientific) and stirred
for 20 min. This electrostatic plating step coats the Si NPs with
a thin layer of Pd film. Again, the Pd-coated Si NPs were washed with
DI water and collected by centrifugation. The third step is to replace
Pd with Fe by electroless plating. Specifically, the Pd-coated Si
NPs were stirred for 5 min in 100 mL of DI water solution that contained
11.8 g of sodium citrate, 3.1 g of ammonium iron sulfate, 0.37 g of
boric acid, 0.4 g of saccharin, and 0.1 g of lysine (all from Sigma-Aldrich).
Then, 0.3 g of sodium borohydride (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to
the solution to initiate the electroless plating reaction. The resulted
Si/Fe NPs were magnetic, so they were collected with a magnet. After
rinsing with isopropyl alcohol and fully drying in vacuum, the Si/Fe
NPs were annealed in a furnace in air at 450 °C for 5 h at a
ramping time of 3 h. After annealing, the color of the NPs changed
from black to red, indicating that the Fe shell was oxidized to Fe2O3.

DSC Measurement of Si/Fe2O3 CS and MM
NPs
For a typical DSC measurement, a Si/Fe2O3 sample of about 5 mg (either CS or MM NPs) was placed in
a 100 μL alumina crucible. The sample was heated in an inert
argon environment (40 sccm) from room temperature to 900 °C at
a heating rate of 5 °C/min. After the samples were cooled down
to room temperature, they were heated with the same process again.
The second-round heat flow traces were used to correct the baseline
of the first-round heat flow traces following the method described
previously.25
