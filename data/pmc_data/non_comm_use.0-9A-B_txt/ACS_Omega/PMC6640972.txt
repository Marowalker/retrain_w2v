For designing energetic
materials (EMs), the most challenging issue
is to achieve a balance between energetic performance and reliable stability.
In this work, we employed an efficient and convenient method to synthesize
a new class of EMs: nitrogen-rich tetranuclear metal complexes [M(Hdtim)(H2O)2]4 (M = Zn 1, Mn 2; H3dtim = 1H-imidazol-4,5-tetrazole)
with the N content of >46%. The structural analyses illustrate
that
isomorphous compounds 1 and 2 feature isolated
hollow ellipsoid tetranuclear units, which are linked by both π–π
interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions to give a 3D supramolecular
architecture. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit
prominent energetic characteristics: excellent detonation performances
and reliable thermal, impact, and friction stabilities. Being
nitrogen-rich tetrazolate compounds, the enthalpies of combustion
of 1 (−11.570 kJ g–1) and 2 (−12.186 kJ g–1) are higher than
those of classical EMs, RDX and HMX, and they possess high positive
heats of formation. Sensitivity tests demonstrate that 1 and 2 are insensitive to external mechanical action.
Excellent energetic performances and low sensitivities promote 1 and 2 to serve as a new class of promising
EMs with a desirable level of safety.

Introduction
Energetic materials
(EMs), encompassing explosives, propellants,
and pyrotechnics, with an irreplaceable role in military affairs and
civilian applications, have been extensively used for almost two centuries.1 The desired aim of designing new-generation EMs
is to acquire high heat of detonation, low sensitivities including
synthesis and handling, good thermal stabilities, low cost, and environmental
acceptability.2 However, the traditional
EMs, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), often encounter the problems
regarding detonation properties and sensitivities.3 Recently, nitrogen-rich organic materials and nitrogen-rich
energetic salts, as a result of high positive enthalpy of formation
derived from the transformation of nitrogen-containing bonds, have
attracted immense attention.4 Nevertheless,
the conflict of high energy and desired safety cannot be completely
resolved. Hence, it is of great importance to develop new-generation
EMs to balance the energetic performance and safety.

To deal
with the contradiction between the detonation properties
and sensitivities, some methods have been developed. One of the valid
strategies is to construct structurally stable compounds containing
energetic fragments. For example, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1,3,5-triamine
holds the typical π-stacked structure, which can effectually
buffer against mechanical action to remarkably reduce the sensitivity.5 With the aim of
adjusting the structures to achieve the desired properties, the research
can mainly be focused on the regulation of components and their spatial
arrangements, including synthesis of co-crystals (such as a 1:1 co-crystal
of hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) and TNT, displaying outstanding
explosive power with reduced sensitivity) and exploitation of some
energetic salts, which can modulate the relationships between the
energetic characteristics and sensitivity by the selection and modification
of cationic and anionic components.6 Besides
using energetic co-crystals and energetic salts,5a,7 another
effective and easy method is to use
energetic metal-organic complexes, which have received widespread
concern for their structural diversities and have stirred a great
deal of interest in the field of EMs in recent years.8 In 2012, the Hope-Weeks group reported two 1D metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) [Co(N2H4)5(ClO4)2]n (CHP) and [Ni(N2H4)5(ClO4)2]n (NHP), which show good detonation properties;
however, these two complexes are too sensitive to meet the commercial
demand.2a To obtain less sensitive complexes,
they synthesized another two 2D MOFs [Co2(N2H4)4(N2H3CO2)2(ClO4)2·H2O]n (CHHP) and [Zn2(N2H4)3(N2H3CO2)2(ClO4)2·H2O]n (ZnHHP), revealing a considerable reduction
in the sensitivity with the heat of detonation decreased.9 In 2013, the Pang group reported two 3D energetic
MOFs [Cu(atrz)3(NO3)2]n (CuATRZ) and [Ag(atrz)1.5(NO3)]n (AgATRZ) (atrz = 4,4′-azo-1,2,4-triazole),
incorporating lots of nitrate anions into the frameworks.10 They obtained large values of the heats of detonation
(CuATRZ) with considerable stabilities and acceptable sensitivities.
These results suggest that metal-organic complexes with the desired
physical and chemical characteristics (such as high density, excellent
energetic performance, and high stability), as a newly emerging field,
would provide a chance for developing new EMs.11

Despite these advancements, the present energetic
metal-organic
complexes are mainly restricted to mononuclear metal complexes with
low stabilities and MOFs with a permanent porosity, usually giving
the negative effects of energetic characteristics. Polynuclear nitrogen-rich
metal complexes, as an important type of metal-organic complexes,
possess a stable multinuclear structural motif and tightly packed
mode, which endow N-rich metal complexes with potential applications
in EMs.

As we all know, five-membered nitrogen-rich heterocycles,
with
excellent chemical stability from the system of aromatic ring, such
as imidazole and tetrazole derivatives,12 own high enthalpy of formation derived from the powerful energy
release from energetic C–N, N–N, and N=N bonds
to provide the main energy source.13 Furthermore,
the combustion products of tetrazole derivatives are environmentally
friendly.14 Sharpless and Xiong developed
an environmentally friendly, efficient, and convenient method to synthesize
5-substituted-1H-tetrazoles by 3 + 2 cycloaddition
reactions of azides and nitriles with metal salts as catalysts,15 which has been used to synthesize a variety
of tetrazole-based MOFs in our lab,16 some
of which exhibit good energetic performance.16b,16c Encouraged by our early success, we try to obtain new EMs assembled
by nitrogen-rich tetrazole derivatives.17,18 In this work,
the 4,5-di(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2H imidazole
(H3dtim) ligand (Scheme 1) and Zn(II)/Mn(II) ions 
were selected on the basis of the following considerations: (i) H3dtim is an aromatic ligand with a high N content of 68.63%,
which is inclined to form rigid metal-organic complexes to enhance
the structural stability; (ii) the N-containing heterocycles offer
the possibility of the π–π stacking interactions
to consolidate the product structures; and (iii) H3dtim
possesses 10 coordination N atoms and can display diverse coordination
modes to form various structures.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of 1 and 2
Herein, two isomorphous
energetic nitrogen-rich tetranuclear metal
complexes, [Zn(Hdtim)(H2O)2]41 and [Mn(Hdtim)(H2O)2]42, were obtained by in situ hydrothermal ligand synthesis
(Scheme 1). The structures
of 1 and 2 feature rare open ellipsoid tetranuclear
units via both π–π stacking interactions and hydrogen-bonding
interactions to give a 3D supramolecular network. Both of them exhibit
excellent energetic performance and low sensitivity. Notably, the
heat of detonation of 2 (3.953 kcal g–1) is comparable to that of Cu(Htztr) (H2tztr = 3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-triazole) (3.958 kcal
g–1), the most powerful energetic MOF reported.2c Compounds 1 and 2 are
the first examples of the N-rich tetranuclear metal complexes as candidates
of EMs.

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure
Compounds 1 and 2 are isomorphous and display isolated
tetranuclear structures.
A full description of 1 is given as a representative
example. The asymmetric unit is composed of two Zn(II) atoms, two
Hdtim2– groups, and four coordinated H2O molecules, as shown in Figure 1a. The imidazole ring in Hdtim2– retains
the original state without deprotonation, and both tetrazole rings
are deprotonated after coordination. The two independent Zn(II) atoms
have the same coordination pattern to furnish a distorted octahedral
geometry. The equatorial bonds in the Zn1 atom are formed through
three nitrogen atoms (N10, N25, N26) and one oxygen atom (O2W). The
axial bonds are formed
by one nitrogen atom (N19) and one oxygen atom (O4W). The Zn2 atom
is six-coordinated by four nitrogen atoms (N20, N29, N15A, N16A) and
two oxygen atoms (O1W, O3W). The
O/N–Zn–O/N angles vary from 76.08(7) to 175.15(8)°
and the Zn–N and Zn–O bond lengths vary from 2.104(2)
to 2.215(2) Å and 2.0716(19) to 2.195(2) Å, respectively
(Table S1). The two Zn(II) atoms are interconnected
by the Hdtim2– ligand with a μ2-κN25,N26:κN20,N29 coordination style to result in a
dinuclear unit with a Zn1···Zn2 distance of 6.0741(7)
Å. Then, the two dinuclear units are further bridged by two μ2-Hdtim2– ligands to produce a centrosymmetric
open ellipsoid tetranuclear unit.

Figure 1 (a) Molecular structure of tetranuclear 1. Symmetry
code: (A) 1 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z. The π–π interactions
(pink dotted lines) are shown in the tetranuclear unit. (b) The π–π
interactions (pink dotted lines) between adjacent tetranuclear units.
All hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity.

The centroid–centroid distance of the π–π
interactions between tetrazole rings in each tetranuclear unit is
3.60 Å (Figure 1a). The π–π interaction distances between adjacent
tetranuclear units lie in the range of 3.62–3.98 Å (Figure 1b and Table S2). Because of the presence of a variety
of coordinated water molecules, there are abundant hydrogen-bonded
donors (coordinated water molecules and protonated imidazole rings)
and acceptors (deprotonated tetrazole rings) to construct a hydrogen-bonded
supramolecular network (Table S3 and Figure S1). A large number of supramolecular interactions can make contributions
to the low sensitivities of energetic compounds 1 and 2.

Thermal Stability
The experimental
powdered X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns of 1 and 2 are consistent
with the simulated data, indicating the phase purities of the samples
(Figure S2). The thermogravimetry (TG)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves (Figures 2 and 3) demonstrate that the weight loss of 12.22% in 1, starting
at 112 °C and ending at 236 °C, can be ascribed to the release
of two coordinated water molecules (calcd: 11.86%). The weight loss
of 11.01%, in the temperature range of 195–251 °C, is
in conformity with the removal of two coordinated water molecules
for 2 (calcd: 12.28%). Then, no weight loss of both 1 and 2 was observed up to 320 °C. With
continuous heating, the compounds continued to break down as a result
of the decomposition of organic ligands.

Figure 2 TG curves of 1 and 2.

Figure 3 DSC curves of 1 and 2.

The DSC curves show the endothermic peaks of 1 and 2observed
at 229 and 234 °C, respectively, on account of the removal of
coordinated water molecules. The exothermic process of both 1 and 2 began at 320 °C, peaked at 360 °C
to the exothermic peaks,
and ended at 372 °C, resulting from the decomposition of organic
ligands.

Heat of Combustion
Compared with traditional EMs, such
as RDX, with the main energy source being oxidation of the carbon
skeletons, nitrogen-rich EMs gain their energy from high positive
heats of formation, owing to the presence of a number of energetic
N–N and C–N bonds. Both compounds 1 and 2 possess good thermal stability and high nitrogen contents
of 46.12 and 47.75%, respectively, to prompt them as prospective EMs.
The experimental constant-volume combustion heat (ΔcU) values of 1 and 2 were
measured by oxygen bomb calorimetry to be 11.603 and 12.216 kJ g–1, respectively. The enthalpy of combustion (ΔcH) was deduced from ΔcU by the following correction: ΔcH = ΔcU + ΔnRT, where Δn is the change in the
total molar quantities of gases during the reaction process, R = 8.314 J mol–1 K–1, and T = 298.15 K. The combustion reactions are
given in eqs 1 and 2 as follows 1   2  The calculated ΔcH values of 1 and 2 are −11.570
and −12.186 kJ g–1, respectively, which are
not only higher than those of the commercial EMs, HMX (−9.44
to −9.88 kJ g–1) and RDX (−9.60 kJ
g–1),19 but also higher
than those of 3D MOFs CdATZ (−6.672 kJ g–1) (CdATZ = (Et4N)[Cd6Br5(ATZ)8]·H2O, HATZ = 5-aminotetrazolate, Et = ethyl),20 CoBTA (−5.92 kJ g–1) (CoBTA = Co9(BTA)10(HBTA)2(H2O)10, H2BTA = N,N-bis(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)-amine),21 and CuNaMtta (−11.389 kJ g–1) (CuNaMtta = Cu4Na(Mtta)5(CH3CN),
Mtta = 5-methyl tetrazole).17 The enthalpies
of formation (ΔfH°) of the
two compounds were calculated by the Hess thermochemical cycle, as
shown in eqs 3 and 4, and deduced as 1.0959 and 0.7697 MJ kg–1, respectively, where ΔfH°
(ZnO, s) = −348.00 kJ mol–1, ΔfH° (CO2, g) = −393.51
kJ mol–1, ΔfH°
(MnO2, s) = −520.00 kJ mol–1,
and ΔfH° (H2O, l)
= −285.83 kJ mol–1. 3   4  Obviously, compared with
traditional EMs and
some energetic metal coordination compounds, both 1 (1.0959
MJ kg–1) and 2 (0.7697 MJ kg–1) (Table 1) possess
higher ΔfH°, which results
in considerable energy from the explosion, making 1 and 2 potential EMs.

Detonation Properties
The heat of detonation (ΔHdet) is a critical parameter to evaluate energetic
performance of EMs, which is difficult to evaluate through experiments.
To compare the ΔHdet values of 1 and 2 with those of other reported energetic
MOFs, we employed the DFT method adopted by Hope-Weeks to evaluate
ΔHdet,2a,9 which
has been widely applied to estimate the relative energetic performance
of MOFs (Tables S4 and S5).2c,8b,8c,8e,10,17,21 Owing to the shortage of oxygen, metal oxides, carbon,
nitrogen, water, and ammonia are presumed to be the decomposition
products of 1 and 2. The detonation reactions
considered for 1 and 2 are described by eqs 5 and 6. 5   6  The ΔHdet values are calculated to be 3.558 kcal g–1 for 1 and 3.953 kcal g–1 for 2.
Both of them show prominent detonation performance, and their heats
of detonation are superior to those of the majority of the previously
reported energetic metal-organic complexes (e.g., NHP,2a CHHP,9 and AgATRZ10). To the best of our knowledge, the ΔHdet of 2 (3.953 kcal g–1) is close to the largest value reported for energetic MOF CuHtztr2c (3.958 kcal g–1) (Figure 4 and Table S5). The high heats of detonation of 1 and 2 are perhaps ascribed to the enhanced
structural reinforcement and high nitrogen contents.

the ΔHdet values for some previously
reported energetic MOFs including CuHtztr,2c CuATRZ,10 AgATRZ,10 NHP,2a CHP,2a CHHP,9 and ZnHHP.9 The predicted ΔHdet values for 1 and 2 are also shown for
comparison.

To further study the
detonation feature, the detonation pressure
(P) and detonation velocity (D)
of 1 and 2 were estimated by Kamlet–Jacbos
equations.22 Thermochemical properties P and D of 1, 2, and the selected energetic metal coordination compounds are displayed
in Figure 5 and Table S5. The calculated values of P and D of 1 were 44.57 GPa and 9.610
km s–1, respectively, which have more prominent
features than those of most of the reported energetic MOFs.

MOFs.

Sensitivity Test
In both the civilian applications
and military energetic devices, one of the most vital indicators to
assess the safety of EMs is the sensitivity, which was classified
according to the U.N. Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous
Goods.a The impact sensitivity values of 1 and 2 are greater than 40 J, implying insensitivity
to impact. No explosion was observed up to 360 N for 1 and 2, which reveals insensitivity to friction. The
collected data of 1, 2, and other explosives
are also summarized in Table 1. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit low
sensitivities, which is probably attributed to the advantage of the
structures with a large number of solid tetranuclear structural motifs,
π–π interactions, and hydrogen bonds to increase
the stability.5

Conclusions
In
summary, we employed
an environmentally friendly and convenient method to synthesize the
first examples of two energetic nitrogen-rich tetranuclear metal complexes 1 and 2 by in situ hydrothermal ligand synthesis.
Compounds 1 and 2 feature unusual open ellipsoid
tetranuclear units, which are connected via both π–π
interactions and hydrogen bonds to give a 3D supramolecular architecture.
In contrast to other reported metal-organic EMs, 1 and 2 exhibit a combination of powerful detonation performances
and low sensitivities because of the high nitrogen contents (>46%)
and close-packed structures. It is worth pointing out that 1 and 2 possess high heats of detonation, which are comparable
to the largest value reported for energetic MOF CuHtztr, indicating
that the two compounds are potentially valuable EMs with a desirable
level of safety. This work not only first reports rare nitrogen-rich
tetranuclear metal complexes as a new class of EMs but also enhances
the future prospects for a reasonable structural design of EMs.

Experimental
Section
General Caution
The sodium azide and tetrazolate compounds
are hazardous materials, which may detonate in some cases and should
be used only in small quantities. Proper protective measures, such
as safety glasses, face shield, leather coat, and plastic spatulas,
should be taken.

Materials and Measurements
All reagents
purchased commercially
were used without further purification. PXRD patterns were recorded
on a Rigaku Miniflex II diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å). The FT-IR spectrums were recorded on a
Perkin-Elmer spectrometer
using KBr pellets from 4000–400 cm–1. DSC
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on
METTLER TOLEDO instrument in N2 at a heating rate of 5
K min–1. The combustion energies were tested by
oxygen bomb calorimetry. First, the certified benzoic acid (about
1.0 g, pellet) was adopted
by combustion in an oxygen atmosphere at a pressure of 2.30 MPa to
calibrate the calorimeter. Second, 300 mg of the pure sample was well-mixed
with the certified benzoic acid (900 mg), which were pressed into
a tablet to guarantee full combustion. Finally, the pellet was sufficiently
burned in a 2.30 MPa atmosphere of pure oxygen in combustion pots.
The impact sensitivities were performed on a BAM fall hammer BFH-12
produced by OZM Research according to STANAG 4489. A 5 kg weight of
the sample was dropped from a set height onto a 20 mg sample placed
on a copper cap. No explosion occurred at the point of 80 cm corresponding
to an impact energy of 40 J. The friction sensitivity was determined
using a BAM friction apparatus FSKM-10 produced by OZM Research on
the basis of STANAG 4487. No explosion happened up to 360 N for the
sample, which implies insensitivity to friction.

stable in common solvents, such as water, methanol, and ethanol, maintaining
their crystallinities for at least several months.

Crystal Structure
Determination
Diffraction data for 1 and 2 were recorded by a Rigaku PILATUS CCD
diffractometer (Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. The
intensity data sets were collected using a ω-scan technique
and reduced using CrystalClear software.23 The structures were solved by direct methods, and the subsequent
successive difference Fourier syntheses yielded other nonhydrogen
atoms. The hydrogen atoms were calculated in idealized positions and
allowed to ride on their parent atoms. The final structures were refined
using a full-matrix least-squares refinement on F2 with the SHELXTL-2014 program.24 Pertinent crystal data and structural refinement
results are listed in Table 2.
