Forming
gas annealing is a common process step used to improve
the performance of devices based on transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs). Here, the impact of forming gas anneal is investigated for
PtSe2-based devices. A range of annealing temperatures
(150, 250, and 350 °C) were used both in inert (0/100% H2/N2) and forming gas (5/95% H2/N2) environments to separate the contribution of temperature
and ambient. The samples are electrically characterized by circular
transfer length method structures, from which contact resistance and
sheet resistance are analyzed. Ti and Ni are used as metal contacts.
Ti does not react with PtSe2 at any given annealing step.
In contrast to this, Ni reacts with PtSe2, resulting in
a contact alloy formation. The results are supported by a combination
of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy, and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy.
The work sheds light on the impact of forming gas annealing on TMD–metal
interfaces, and on the TMD film itself, which could be of great interest
to improve the contact resistance of TMD-based devices.

Introduction
Transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) have been one of the most
studied class of two-dimensional (2D) materials to date. Although
promising, their integration with modern electronics is still limited
due to the rather large Schottky barrier that usually characterizes
the metal–TMD interface, which limits the device behavior,
hiding their potential. In addition, most of the results are based
on exfoliated flakes,1,2 which causes a high variation
from experiment to experiment, especially at low thickness. The lowest
values of contact resistance are usually related to high-k induced doping3,4 or interface engineering.5−8 Although promising, another possible solution still mostly unexplored
is the use of an opportune annealing step to modify the metal–TMD
interface. Annealing is a common process step in the modern semiconductor
industry. Laser annealing is used for Si and Ge to achieve highly
doped and abrupt junctions.9 Additionally,
annealing in forming gas (FG) has been used to reduce fixed oxide
charges and interface states at the Al2O3/InGaAs
interface.10 Similarly, for 2D-semiconductors,
several publications have shown how different annealing steps can
improve the performances of TMD-based devices. Vacuum annealing has
been shown to reduce the concentration of surface contaminants.11,12 Furthermore, annealing in an inert environment or FG can be beneficial
in terms of reducing the density of interface states at the MoS2/oxide interface.13 Annealing steps
have also been shown to be valuable for the TMD–metal interface.
FG annealing (FGA) on graphene/MoS2 contacts was shown
to improve the contact resistance of the material.14 Other annealing techniques, such as vacuum annealing,15 microwave annealing,16 or short-term pulsed annealing,17 were
also reported to be advantageous for the metal/MoS2 interface.
Nonetheless, the values are still far from the requirement of the
International Roadmap for Semiconductors and Systems,18 and the reaction metal–TMD upon annealing as well
as the optimal annealing temperature range and ambient is still unclear.

In this work, we systematically characterize large-area grown thin
films of PtSe2 considering different postgrowth thermal
treatments and their effects on the metal–TMD interface. PtSe2 has attracted increasing interest over the last few years.
As other TMDs, a monolayer of PtSe2 is formed by a three-atom
thick atomic cell, with the transition metal sandwiched between two
chalcogen layers. Most TMDs show semiconductive properties, but interestingly,
PtSe2 shows semimetallic characteristics in its bulk form,
whereas experiments have shown the opening of a band-gap for thicknesses
lower than 3 nm, with ∼1.2 eV for a monolayer.19,20 Therefore, PtSe2 has gained attention due to its potential
application in electronics,21 optoelectronics,22 and sensors.23 PtSe2 can be uniformly grown over a large area by thermally assisted
conversion (TAC), which does not require a high thermal budget (max
temperature of 400 °C). This makes the growth compatible with
back-end-of-line processing and integration in modern technologies,
as it respects the typical thermal budgets of the CMOS industry (∼450
°C).24−26 This is in sharp contrast with TMD films grown by
chemical vapor deposition, chemical vapor transport, or molecular
beam epitaxy.27−30 The growth is not homogenous, and it is characterized mainly by
triangular crystals that merge together after a sufficient growth
time.31−33 Above this, the thermal budget of these processes
is usually high to obtain a reaction of the predeposited film with
the chalcogen, limiting their integration in modern CMOS technology.

The PtSe2 was grown at 400 °C over a large area.
Ti/Au and Ni/Au were used as metal contacts and circular transfer
length method (c-TLM) structures were used to electrically characterize
the metal/PtSe2 interface and the PtSe2 material
itself. The samples were then annealed for 1 h in a FG ambient (5/95%
H2/N2) at different annealing temperatures:
150, 250, and 350 °C. The same experiment was repeated in an
inert environment (0/100% H2/N2). The electrical
properties of the material were studied after each annealing step.
The TMD–metal interface and alloy formation were studied and
characterized by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy,
and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM).

Results
Figure 1 shows the
process flow adopted to study the reaction of PtSe2 after
each annealing step. First, PtSe2 (6–10 nm, with
an initial Pt thickness of 1 nm) was grown on four different samples
in a single growth run for high consistency using a TAC process.34 Because of this, applying a similar FGA step
allows the effect of the process on the material itself and the metal–TMD
interface to be decoupled. c-TLM structures were patterned by standard
photolithography, and Ti/Au or Ni/Au were deposited by metal evaporation.
Then, samples were measured electrically. The presence of PtSe2 was confirmed by Raman analysis.

Figure 1 Experimental steps taken
during this work.

Figure 2a,d shows
the optical microscope images of the contacted PtSe2 with
Ti and Ni contacts, respectively, before any annealing and no visible
differences are present between the two samples. The samples then
underwent different annealing steps. No obvious differences were found
for the samples annealed in FG at 150 °C, as the temperature
might have been too low to start any reactions. After annealing at
250 °C in forming or inert environment, the Ti/Au sample did
not show any appreciable differences from optical inspection (Figure 2b,c). In contrast,
the Ni/Au sample annealed at 250 °C in FG displayed what looks
like an “alloy region” around the metal contacts (Figure 2e). This alloy region
is less pronounced for the annealing at the same temperature in the
inert environment (Figure 2f). It is noted that the reaction taking place between Ni
and PtSe2 is accelerated by the presence of hydrogen during
the annealing. The 350 °C anneal in FG (pictures not shown),
as later confirmed by electrical and Raman characterizations, resulted
in a degradation of the PtSe2. Considering that PtSe2 is grown at a temperature of 400 °C, a FG anneal at
350 °C may be too harsh an environment for this material, which
highlights the importance of understanding the process window for
optimal annealing temperature and its effects on the material properties.

Figure 2 Optical

annealing contacted with (a) Ti/Au and (d) Ni/Au. Same optical
pictures repeated after annealing in FG and inert ambient at 250 °C
for (b,c) Ti/Au and (e,f) Ni/Au, respectively. The darker gold ring
in (e) clearly shows the alloy region.

Figure 3 shows the
electrical characterization carried out on each sample. Figure 3a shows representative current–voltage
measurements on the Ni/Au samples considering a spacing of 43.5 μm.
Although no appreciable differences are visible from optical inspection
after a FG anneal at 150 °C, the current decreases with respect
to the pre-annealed case. In contrast, considering the same FG environment
but a temperature of 250 °C, the current increases, meaning that
the reaction that took place positively changed the metal/PtSe2 interface. The difference is not related to a change in the
properties of the channel as the annealing steps for the Ti/Au samples
did not result in a change of the metal/PtSe2 or the channel
properties (Figure 3c). Consider that the results at 250 °C in FG were corrected
because of the alloy region because it changed the spacing of each
structure (the actual channel length). The anneal at 250 °C in
an inert environment, similarly to the 150 °C in FG, resulted
in a lower current. These two anneal conditions seem to provide similar
results. Although, one was done at a lower temperature, the presence
of FG seems to have accelerated the reactions that took place. It
is also important to consider that the 250 °C in the inert environment
also resulted in an alloy region, although not as pronounced as the
case in FG. In contrast, no alloy regions were found for the sample
annealed at 150 °C in FG.

each annealing step. (b) Total resistance vs spacing for the Ni/Au-contacted
PtSe2. Inset: total resistance vs spacing for the Ti/Au-contacted
PtSe2. (c) Extracted sheet resistance after each annealing
step.

Figure 3b shows
the total resistance versus spacing for the Ni/Au contacted PtSe2 at each annealing step. It is clear that each annealing is
affecting the electrical behavior of the device. Nonetheless, this
analysis is problematic for the Ni/Au samples. Because of the presence
of the alloy region, the fitting process is less reliable because
the spacing of the structures change with the annealing condition.
Future work may include linear TLMs with smaller dimensions for a
more accurate parameter extraction. The inset of Figure 3b shows the same analysis for
the Ti/Au sample for each annealing condition. No appreciable differences
are present, and the trend remains quite similar, meaning that the
film itself, as well as the PtSe2/Ti interface, are not
affected by any annealing steps.

Figure 3c shows
the sheet resistance extracted from each measurement. The sheet resistance
can be extracted from the Ti/Au measurements, considering the c-TLM
theory.35 However, for the Ni/Au samples,
the total resistance was considered as the resistance of the PtSe2 owing to the low contact resistance. The results for the
Ti/Au contacts confirm what is seen in Figure 3a–c and from XTEM images (Figure S1): the annealing temperature and conditions
are not changing the metal/PtSe2 interface or the PtSe2 material itself. In contrast, a much higher variation is
seen for the Ni/Au samples, which can be related to the reaction between
Ni and PtSe2. Consider that, although obvious “alloy
regions” are present from optical inspection it is possible
that the Ni diffuses much further into the PtSe2, than
what is possible to see with an optical microscope.

Raman spectroscopy
was then performed to confirm the integrity
of the PtSe2 and to probe the “alloy region”
seen in the Ni/Au samples. The results are summarized in Table 1 (all Raman results
are reported in Figure S2). In particular,
the Raman signal was collected on the bare PtSe2 and near
the metal contact. For the Ti/Au sample, the signal of PtSe2 is always present, except for the 350 °C annealing in FG, which
resulted in degradation of the PtSe2 film. Similarly, for
the Ni/Au sample a clear PtSe2 signal is present up to
250 °C, in both forming and inert gas environment in the bare
PtSe2 regions (far from the metal contact). For the samples
that showed an “alloy region”, no PtSe2 signal
is present close to the metal contact, suggesting metal interdiffusion
and alloying.

Figure 4 shows representative
TEM images of the Ni/Au-contacted PtSe2 samples annealed
at 250 °C in FG and in an inert environment. Figure 4a,b compare the PtSe2 structure inside and outside of the alloy region, respectively.
It is noted that the layered structure is present outside the alloy
region, whereas it is not inside it. Similarly, Figure 4c,d show the PtSe2 below the metal
contact and outside of it, respectively. Again, the layered structure
is not present below the metal contact but is preserved outside of
it. These representative images confirm the hypothesis. The diffusion
ring seen from optical images is a result of Ni interdiffusing and
alloying with the PtSe2. This compound is not characterized
by the same layered structure of PtSe2, but it has the
form of a 3D alloy. Also, although the alloy region around the contact
is not present in the sample annealed at 250 °C in an inert environment,
a similar reaction has taken place below the metal contact. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the presence of hydrogen accelerates the
reaction, and the Ni can react more readily with PtSe2 away
from the metal itself. It is also important to consider that defects
as grain boundaries, steps or vacancies, are likely to lead to an
increased activity compared to a defect-free film. These likely played
a role in the process, considering both the polycrystalline nature
of this film (Figure 4b) and the nanometer sized grain previously reported.23

Figure 4 Representative XTEM images of the PtSe2 contacted
with
Ni/Au. (a,b) show PtSe2 after annealing in FG at 250 °C
inside and outside the diffusion ring, respectively. (c,d) show the
PtSe2 after annealing in inert environment at 250 °C
below the metal contact and outside the metal contact, respectively.

In order to explore the nature of the interdiffusional
alloying
observed, XPS was performed using near-identical samples. Figure 5 shows XPS spectra
of the Pt 4f and Se 3d core levels of PtSe2 before and
after metal deposition, with no further annealing. No Au was used
here as Au does not interface with the PtSe2. The Pt 4f
spectra for bare PtSe2 (Figure 5a) shows the presence of two chemical states,
both represented by a doublet, one related to PtSe2 (72.15
eV) and another due to surface oxidation (PtOx at 71.1 eV). The Se 3d spectra of the same sample (Figure 5c) show PtSe2 and SeOx features (53.55 and
54.25 eV, respectively), with the additional contribution of the Pt
5p3/2 (52.6 eV), which overlaps with the Se 3d.

Figure 5 XPS spectra
of (a,b) Pt 4f and (c,d) Se 3d core levels for PtSe2 before
and after Ni or Ti deposition.

Upon Ni deposition, a significant change in the peak shape of the
Pt 4f is observed, with the emergence of a feature at low binding
energy (BE). This peak is at lower BE than PtOx, consistent with metallic Pt (Pt0). The Se 3d spectrum
shows a subtler change with broadening to higher BE, attributed to
the possible formation of a Ni/Se compound (NiSex). The Ni 2p spectra are difficult to interpret due to the
presence of several satellite features. Although a change in line
shape is observed in comparison to a reference Ni film, which could
be due to Ni-oxidation or the reaction between Ni and a high electronegativity
element such as Se. Additionally, the shift to higher BE may be due
to charge transfer between the high work function Ni and PtSe2. The Ni 2p spectra and further discussion can be found in
the Supporting Information. Taken together
this suggests the reduction of PtSe2 by Ni, resulting in
NiSex formation and Pt metal.

In
the case of Ti, a much more subtle change in chemical state
is observed. After Ti deposition, the PtOx peak increases significantly and is accompanied by a higher BE feature
consistent with PtO2. The Se 3d also shows a significant
increase in oxidation with an increase in SeOx and the appearance of a higher BE SeO2 peak. The
Ti 2p spectra (not shown) show the complete conversion of Ti to TiO2, which is expected due to the oxygen-gettering nature of
Ti. The presence of excess oxygen in the TiO2 film in turn
oxidizes the underlying PtSe2.

Last, to confirm the
presence of Ni in the reacted region, EDX
was conducted on the TEM cross-section lamellas prepared with the
Ni/Au-contacted devices before and after annealing at 250 °C
in both FG and inert environment at 250 °C. Figure 6 shows the compositional analysis
performed via scanning TEM (STEM)-based EDX spectroscopy. Figure 6a,f shows the high-angle
annular dark-field (HAADF) images of the region under study, which
is at the edge of the metal contact. Figure 6b–d,g–j show the spectra for
Au, Pt, and Se. No significant interdiffusion is observed for these
elements after annealing, and the mapping results are fairly similar.
Considering that Au and Pt have a similar atomic weight, what would
seem to be diffusion of Pt in Au is actually just an artefact from
the EDX. This is not an issue as the focus is on the behavior of Ni
with PtSe2. Figure 6e,f shows clear Ni diffusion upon annealing. Before annealing,
the Ni spectra is clearly confined between the PtSe2 and
the Au region. Whereas after N2 annealing, significant
diffusion of Ni into the Au and PtSe2 regions is observed.
This is consistent with the diffusion seen in the optical images of
c-TLM structures (Figure 2).

Figure 6 Compositional analysis performed via STEM-based EDX on Ni/Au-contacted
PtSe2 lamellas before and after annealing at 250 °C
in N2. (a,f) shows the HAADF image of the region under
study before and after annealing respectively. (b–e) and (g–j)
refer to the Au, Pt, Se, and Ni signal, before and after annealing,
respectively. The scale bar is 25 nm.

Discussion
The interaction between top contacts and TMDs is significantly
different to contacts on conventional semiconductors due to the van
der Waals nature of the TMD surface. Density functional theory simulations
predict that because of the lack of surface covalent bonds for most
deposited metals, a van der Waals gap exists between the TMD surface
and the metal contact.36 This van der Waals
gap acts as a tunnel barrier for carrier injection into the TMD channel,
in addition to the Schottky barrier between the metal and TMD,37 increasing total contact resistance.

A
study by Das et al.38 showed that
the Schottky barriers between metals and MoS2 are not consistent
with the energy difference between the metal work function and the
TMD Fermi level. They showed that even metals which would be expected
to act as p-type contacts (i.e., Ni and Pt) instead exhibited electron
injection consistent with n-type contacts. This was ascribed to Fermi
level pinning in the MoS2 close to the conduction band
minimum at the metal/MoS2 interface.39

Previous XPS studies on MoS2 and WSe2, considering
a range of various metals,40−43 have shown that similar reactions between the as-deposited
metal and a TMD are possible. Nonetheless, an interface reaction does
not necessarily result in a lower contact resistance because of the
defective nature of exfoliated TMD flakes. However, a complete transformation
of the TMD below the contact might mitigate the effect of contact
resistance. Kappera et al.7 demonstrated
low contact resistance in a MoS2 FET varying the phase
of MoS2 below the contact from semiconductive (2H) to metallic
(1T). Similarly, here we showed a Ni/PtSe2 alloy at the
contact and PtSe2 in the channel region. However, in this
work, a contact resistance analysis was not possible. The PtSe2 under study had a thickness of ∼6–10 nm, and
in this thickness range, the PtSe2 behaves as a semimetal,
therefore it is not contact-resistance limited. Once the PtSe2 growth processes are tuned further to achieve few-layer (<3
L) films, a more detailed contact resistance study could be performed.
Also, the annealing temperature and ambient need to be optimized in
order to control the diffusion/reaction of Ni.

A behavior similar
to Ni and PtSe2 has also been observed
for Ag/MoS2.44 In that work,
the samples were annealed between 250 and 350 °C in a rapid thermal
annealing furnace for 300 s and the contact resistance values decreased
after the thermal treatment because of Ag diffusion and doping below
the contact regions. Although Ag does not react with MoS2 at room temperature,45 Souder and Brodie46,47 showed that Ag diffused in bulk MoS2 after annealing
at 400–600 °C for 5 min, estimating a concentration of
approximately 1019 cm–3.

It is
unclear if the Ni is acting as a dopant for PtSe2, however,
the metal–TMD reaction could be of great interest
to improve the contact resistance of TMD-based devices.

Conclusions
In this study, the Ti/PtSe2 and Ni/PtSe2 interfaces
were explored, along with the impact of post-metallization anneals
in FG and inert ambient. Electrical and chemical characterization
show that Ti is unreactive after annealing, even at relatively high
temperature, whereas Ni readily reacts with PtSe2 to form
NiSex and reduced PtSex/Pt/metal. The reaction is enhanced with high temperatures
or a hydrogen-rich environment, which can cause the Ni to diffuse
laterally into the PtSe2. The metal/PtSe2 alloying
is a possible solution for reducing contact resistance in few-layer
devices based on PtSe2 and other TMD materials.

Experimental
Section
Growth
All PtSe2 samples were grown over
large area. Pt metal evaporated onto a SiO2/Si substrate.
This was then converted in a furnace with a Se pressure of ∼1
mbar at 400 °C. The specifics of the growth are discussed in
detail elsewhere.48

Metal Deposition
c-TLM metal contacts were patterned
using standard photolithography followed by e-beam evaporation of
the metal and a lift-off process. For these devices the targeted thicknesses
were 10/90 nm for both Ti/Au and Ni/Au at a background pressure of
∼10–5 mbar. For the XPS samples, the targeted
thicknesses were 3 nm for both Ti and Ni. No Au was used in the XPS
samples as it does not interface with the PtSe2 film and
the added metal thickness would exceed the photoelectron escape depth
(of ∼5 nm). After an initial characterization, each sample
was cleaved into three pieces to maintain consistency. FG anneals
were performed at 150, 250, and 350 °C for 1 h using 5% H2/95% N2. The same annealing conditions were applied
again in an inert environment (0% H2/100% N2).

Characterization
XPS characterization was performed
using monochromated Al Kα X-rays from an Omicron XM1000 MkII
X-ray source and Omicron EA125 hemispherical analyzer with ±0.05
eV resolution. A take-off angle of 45°, acceptance angle of 8°,
and pass energy of 15 eV were employed during spectral acquisition.
The BE scale was referenced to the adventitious carbon species in
the C 1s core level (285.8 eV). Spectra were deconvolved using AAnalyzer,49 a curve fitting software.

For structural
analysis, cross-section samples were obtained by using the Dual Beam
Helios NanoLab 600i system from FEI, using a Ga ion beam. Layers of
the protective material were used consisting of electron beam deposited
C, Pt, and ion beam deposited C. Lamellas were thinned and polished
at 30 kV 100 pA and 5 kV 47 pA, respectively. XTEM imaging was carried
out using a JEOL 2100 HRTEM, operated at 200 kV in the bright field
mode using a Gatan double tilt holder. EDX mapping was carried out
using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Themis operated of 300 kV in
the STEM mode using the Bruker SuperX silicon drift detector.
