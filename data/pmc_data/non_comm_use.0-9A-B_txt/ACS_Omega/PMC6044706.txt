Gallium-68
(68Ga) is a positron emitter for clinical
positron emission tomography (PET) applications that can be produced
by a 68Ge/68Ga generator without cyclotron.
However, commercially available 68Ge/68Ga generator
systems require multiple steps for the preparation of 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals and are sometimes plagued by metallic impurities
in the 68Ga eluent. We developed a 68Ge/68Ga generator system using polysaccharide-based adsorbents
and direct application of the generator-eluted 68Ga-citrate
to PET imaging of tropical infectious diseases. N-Methylglucamine (MG) as a 68Ge-adsorbing unit (Sepha-MGs)
was introduced to a series of Sephadex G-10, G-15, G-25, G-50, and
G-75. In the batch method, over 97% of the 68Ge in the
solution was adsorbed onto the Sepha-MG series within 15 min. In particular, 68Ge was effectively adsorbed on the Sepha(15)-MG packed columns
and 70–80% of the 68Ga was eluted by 1 mL of 0.1
M trisodium citrate with low 68Ge contamination (<0.001%).
The chemical form of the generator-eluted 68Ga solution
was identified as 68Ga-citrate. In PET studies, affected
regions in mice infected with Leishmania and severe
fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus were clearly visualized
using the 68Ga-citrate. Sepha-MGs are useful adsorbents
for 68Ge/68Ga generator systems with high 68Ga elution efficiency and minimal 68Ge breakthrough.
These results indicated that eluted 68Ga-citrate can be
directly used for PET imaging of infectious sites in mice. This novel
generator system may be useful for straightforward PET imaging of
infection in clinical practice.

Introduction
Positron
emission tomography (PET) is a powerful molecular imaging
tool for detection of various molecular events in living subjects
with high sensitivity. Gallium-68 (68Ga) is a positron
emitter for clinical PET applications.1,2 Because 68Ga radionuclide can be produced by a 68Ge/68Ga generator, an on-site cyclotron is not necessary, which
allows the production of desired 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals
on demand. Its 67.71 min half-life also renders its use practical,
allowing it to be bound to low-molecular-weight compounds, peptides,
certain fragments of antibodies, and their derivatives.3,4 Several 68Ge/68Ga generators are commercially
available and used for clinical and/or research purposes, with matrices
based on TiO2 (Eckert-Ziegler GmbH, Berlin, Germany), SnO2 (iThemba, Johannesburg, South Africa), or silica resin (ITG
GmbH, Munich, Germany).5 The 68Ga eluent from these generators can be used for the production of
various 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, such as 68Ga-DOTA-TOC for detection of somatostatin receptor-expressing
cancer tissues.1,4−6 However, TiO2- and SnO2-based generators have several drawbacks
such as low concentration of 68Ga in the eluate, contamination
with long-half-life parent 68Ge, and contamination with
metallic elements including Zn(II), Ti(IV), and Fe(III). Although
these disadvantages can be eliminated by several concentration and
purification procedures, complicated apparatuses and operations are
needed that may present obstacles to routine clinical use.7−10 Because silica-based resin has a low affinity for the metallic elements,
this type of generator has potential as a next-generation system for
clinical use.11,12 All of these generators require
HCl solution to elute the 68Ga, thereby necessitating multiple
synthetic and purification steps for the production of 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals.13 It would be
ideal if the generator-eluted 68Ga solution could directly
be used as a radiopharmaceutical similarly to 99Mo/99mTc.

Previously, we found that the commercially available
organic copolymer
Diaion CRB-02 (R-MGlu, Mitsubishi Chemical Company, Tokyo, Japan)
has high affinity for 68Ge and low affinity for 68Ga. CRB-02 is a macroporous styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer containing
1-deoxy-1-(methylamino) sorbitol (N-methylglucamine,
MG). It has been demonstrated that the MG groups in CRB-02 are responsible
for the strong 68Ge adsorption and high 68Ga
separation efficiency.14 In contrast to
the other generator systems, CRB-02 shows high 68Ga elution
efficiency at nearly neutral pH, which makes it possible to use the
eluate directly as a 68Ga radiopharmaceutical. We have
found that trisodium citrate can elute a solution of 68Ga-citrate with high efficiency.14,1567Ga-citrate planar and single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) imaging have been widely used for diagnosis of cancers,16−18 sarcoidosis,19 and inflammatory and/or
infectious diseases20,21 in clinical practice. 68Ga-citrate has shown promise in PET imaging of prostate cancer,22Staphylococcus aureus infection,23 and osteomyelitis.24 The 68Ga-citrate used in these studies
was prepared from a strong acid solution of 68GaCl3 produced from the currently available 68Ge/68Ga generators. A generator system that can produce 68Ga-citrate by elution with trisodium citrate would be more convenient.
One disadvantage of the CRB-02-based generator system is that a large
amount of trisodium citrate (10 mL) is required to elute the 80% yield
of the 68Ga solution.14,15 Considering
that approximately 1.5–2.0 mL of 67Ga-citrate has
generally been used for one patient in clinical practice,25,26 a more concentrated 68Ga-citrate solution is desirable.
CRB-02 is mainly composed of the styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer
and is highly hydrophobic. As 68Ga-citrate is a hydrophilic
molecule, hydrophilic environments physically close to MGs may boost
the elution efficiency of 68Ga. Sephadex (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) series, chromatographic carriers for
gel filtration, are composed of dextran. These polymers have many
surface hydroxyl groups that can be covalently linked with functional
MG groups. Several types of Sephadex with different degrees of cross-linkage
are commercially available. The rank order of the degree of cross-linking
is as follows: G-10 > G-15 > G-25 > G-50 > G-75, whereas
the order
in increasing degree of expansion is as follows: G-75 > G-50 >
G-25
> G-15 > G-10.27 Differences in their
properties
allow the systematic evaluation of synthesized generators. Hence,
we sought to develop a new 68Ge/68Ga generator
system based on these polysaccharides. In this study, we developed
MG-containing Sephadex (Sepha-MGs) that showed strong 68Ge adsorption power and minimal 68Ge breakthrough. 68Ga-citrate could be effectively eluted by the Sepha-MG packed
columns using a much smaller amount of trisodium citrate than that
of Diaion CRB-02. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PET imaging
with generator-eluted 68Ga-citrate successfully visualized
mice models of tropical infectious diseases. Our results demonstrate
the application of Sepha-MGs for the convenient 68Ge/68Ga system of which the 68Ga eluent can be directly
used for the diagnosis of various infectious diseases.

Results
Characterization
of Sepha-MGs
The nucleophilic addition
of the epoxy groups in the polymers with MG gave the desired Sepha-MG
(Figure 1). The MG-modified
Sephadex beads were used as polymer matrices for immobilizing the 68Ge. Figure 2 shows the 68Ge adsorption rates of the Sepha-MGs by the
batch operation method. Diaion CRB-02 was used for the comparison
of basic performance with Sepha-MGs. All Sepha-MGs showed >97%
of
the adsorption rate of the 68Ge in the solution after 15
min of shaking. In contrast, only 78% of 68Ge was adsorbed
by CRB-02 at 15 min.

Figure 2 Time-course of 68Ge adsorption to
Sepha-MGs and CRB-02
in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) determined by the batch operation
method.

Table 1 shows the
characteristics of the different Sepha-MGs. Because Sephadex has no
nitrogen atoms, the nitrogen content indicates the amount of introduced
MGs. The numbers following “G-” of their names such
as 25, 50, and 100 indicate their swelling property and the number
of hydroxyl groups; the larger the number, the higher the degree of
swelling and the larger the number of hydroxyl groups. The degree
of swelling and nitrogen content of Sepha-MGs increased with increasing
the numbers, indicating that the basic properties of Sephadex did
not appear to change by the modification of MGs. The Ge adsorption
capacities in the wet state of Sepha(10)-MG, Sepha(15)-MG, and Sepha(25)-MG
were higher than those of Sepha(50)-MG and Sepha(75)-MG. Accordingly,
Sepha(10)-MG, Sepha(15)-MG, and Sepha(25)-MG were used for further
evaluation.

Sepha(10)-MG,
Sepha(15)-MG, and Sepha(25)-MG were separately packed
into a teflon-made column, and then the adsorption, 68Ge
breakthrough, and elution efficiency of 68Ga were evaluated.
When 3.7 MBq of 68Ge was loaded onto the Sepha-MG packed
columns, >97% of 68Ge was absorbed in each generator
and
over 60% of the 68Ga could be eluted by 1 mL of 0.1 M trisodium
citrate. The three Sepha-MGs showed much higher 68Ga elution
efficiencies than that of CRB-02 (Figure 3). Breakthrough of 68Ge was less
than 0.01% for the three Sepha-MG packed columns (data not shown).

Figure 3 68Ga elution profiles from Sepha-MG columns with 0.1
M trisodium citrate.

Sepha(15)-MG, Sepha(25)-MG, and Sepha(10)-MG showed equivalent
elution profiles. Sephadex G-15 has a higher degree of cross-linkage
than that of Sephadex G-25, which indicates that the physical durability
of Sepha(15)-MG is greater in comparison to that of Sepha (25)-MG.
Accordingly, further evaluation of Sepha(15)-MG as an adsorbent for
a 68Ge/68Ga generator was performed using higher
amounts of radioactivity. Figure 4 shows the evaluation of 74 MBq in a generator composed
of Sepha(15)-MG. This generator showed a similar performance, with
high 68Ga elution efficiency and quite low 68Ge breakthrough (<0.001%), as shown in Figure 4A. Furthermore, elution of 68Ga
was used after 244 days to check the reproducibility of the generator
system and resulted in identical elution efficiency (Figure 4B). Paper chromatography analysis
revealed that >95% of the 68Ga solution was in the form
of 68Ga-citrate (Figure 5).

PET/CT Imaging of Infected
Mice with 68Ga-Citrate
Characterization of Sepha-MGs
indicated that the generator-eluted 68Ga solution can be
directly used as 68Ga-citrate.
Therefore, we performed small animal PET/CT studies with 68Ga-citrate to visualize inflammatory foci in mice infected with Leishmania and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
virus (SFTSV). Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases
caused by infection with Leishmania parasites, with
symptoms ranging from self-healing cutaneous lesions to a fatal visceral
disorder.31 SFTSV is a recently identified
emerging disease in East Asia that shows various symptoms, including
fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, and regional lymphadenopathy
caused by the SFTSV.32Figure 6 shows representative PET/CT
images acquired 120–180 min after intravenous injection of 68Ga-citrate in mice infected with Leishmania
major in the left hind footpad. There was significant 68Ga-citrate accumulation in the infected left hind footpad,
whereas no significant signals were observed in the phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)-injected right hind footpad. Figure 7A shows representative PET/CT images of SFTSV-infected
or mock-infected mice at 120–180 min after intravenous injection
of 68Ga-citrate. Significant accumulation of 68Ga-citrate is clearly visible in the gastrointestinal tract, a target
site of SFTSV, in the SFTSV-infected mice. On the other hand, there
is quite low activity in the gastrointestinal tract of mock-infected
mice (Figure 7A). Next,
we performed similar PET studies using FDG, which can be used for
the detection of infectious inflammatory regions.33 As shown in Figure 7B, the gastrointestinal tract was clearly visualized in the
SFTSV-infected mice, whereas there were no significant signals in
the mock-infected mice. The accumulation pattern of 18F-FDG
is similar to that of 68Ga-citrate, indicating that 68Ga-citrate could also visualize the inflammation induced
by SFTSV infection.

PET/CT images were acquired 120–180 min after intravenous injection

but not in the uninfected contralateral leg (blue arrows).

(B). The yellow arrows indicate the gastrointestinal tract.

Discussion
Commercially
available 68Ge/68Ga generator
systems composed of TiO2 and SnO2 are subject
to several major problems. First, considerable metallic impurities
can be detected in the generator-eluted solution. Second, 68Ga3+ needs to be eluted with HCl in association with the
necessity of multiple steps for preparing 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals,
which makes 68Ga labeling complicated and inconvenient
for PET imaging in clinical practice.34 In view of these concerns, we developed a new 68Ge/68Ga generator system to overcome such problems. We have previously
reported that organic polymer CRB-02 exhibited selective adsorption
of 68Ge and had a higher elution efficiency using trisodium
citrate without significant 68Ge breakthrough. The chemical
form of the eluate was 68Ga-citrate, which can be directly
applied to PET imaging without further modification.14,15 However, the elution volume needed reduction for clinical applications,
which requires significant improvement of elution efficiency. This
may be due to poor accessibility of trisodium citrate to the MG groups
on the hydrophobic backbone polymer of CRB-02. We developed MG-group-containing
Sephadex (Sepha-MGs) that showed strong 68Ge adsorption
ability and low 68Ge leakage and allowed 68Ga-citrate
to be directly eluted with much smaller volumes of trisodium citrate
than that in CRB-02. The parameters of commercially available and
newly developed generators, including gallium elution capabilities,
metallic impurity, and 68Ge breakthrough, are summarized
in Table 2. It is reported
that over 3 mL of HCl solution was required to elute about 75% of 68Ga from commercially available generators composed of TiO2, SnO2, or SiO2 (Table 2) and recently developed 68Ge/68Ga generators using the CeO2-polyacrylonitrile
sorbent.13 We demonstrated that 75% of 68Ga solution was eluted by 1 mL of trisodium citrate from
a Sepha(MG)-15-based generator (Figure 4A), indicating that the elution efficiency of Sepha(MG)-15
is superior to that of the previously reported 68Ge adsorbents.
Several metallic impurities have been found in the commercially available
generators.13 We have not examined the
metal impurity of Sepha-MGs, but the organic polymers might not contain
any intrinsic metal. The 68Ge breakthrough from the Sepha(MG)-15-based
generator was less than 0.001%, which is comparable to that from the
clinically available generators (Table 2).13 The elution efficiency
of Sepha(MG)-15 had not changed 244 days after a load of 68Ge (Figure 4B), suggesting
that Sepha(MG)-15 has high stability over time. Accordingly, Sepha(MG)-15
may be an optimal adsorbent for 68Ge/68Ga generator
systems. Indeed, PET imaging with 68Ga-citrate eluted with
this system successfully visualized the site of infection with L. major and SFTSV in mice. BALB/c mice inoculated
in the footpad with L. major develop
inflammation at the injection site, which is a consequence of the
parasite growth and the host immune responses.29 As shown in Figure 6, PET imaging with 68Ga-citrate can recognize the
inflammatory foci caused by L. major infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Leishmania-infected regions visualized by small animal molecular
imaging techniques. Previously, we reported that PET imaging with 18F-FDG could visualize the intestinal tract as a pathological
site of SFTSV-infected mice.30 We also
demonstrated that 68Ga-citrate showed significant signals
in the gastrointestinal tract of SFTSV-infected mice. In contrast
to that of 18F-FDG-PET, physiological accumulation of 68Ga-citrate was absent in the muscle, as shown in Figure 7. Accordingly, our
data suggested that 68Ga-citrate PET can be a useful imaging
tool for the detection of SFTS-infected regions. It is suggested that 68Ga-citrate PET can be useful for the detection of infectious
sites, investigation of disease progression, and monitoring of therapeutic
effects of various infectious disorders, such as the neglected tropical
diseases. 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals can be produced
without an expensive cyclotron, and our generator may be cost-effective
compared to commercially available generators in terms of the 68Ga elution efficiency and cost of matrices. This economic
advantage would be especially important for the developing countries
spreading the neglected tropical diseases. In our preliminary experiments
for clinical application, 68GeCl4 of higher
radioactivity (337 MBq) was loaded onto Sepha-MG(15), resulting in
78% elution of 68Ga-citrate from the generator by 4 mL
of eluent but 68Ge breakthrough was increased to over 0.02%.
However, most of the 68Ge impurity can be removed by the
pre-column packed with a small amount of Sepha-MG(15) (unpublished
data). We have previously demonstrated that 68Ga-citrate
can be reacted with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and deferoxamine to
label polypeptides.14,15 Therefore, this generator system
can also be used for the production of various 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals.
However, 68Ga-citrate, eluted using Sepha-MG, had a relatively
lower reaction efficiency with chelating agents such as 1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic
acid (NOTA) than GaCl3 did. Approximately 27 μM precursor
NOTA-arginylglycylaspartic acid (NOTA-RGD) was reacted with 68GaCl3 in aqueous HCl produced by a commercially available
generator for 10 min at room temperature to synthesize 68Ga-NOTA-RGD in 89% yield.35 In contrast,
500 μM precursor NOTA-RGD and heating were required to synthesize 68Ga-NOTA-RGD in 90% yield when 68Ga-citrate was
used as the 68Ga source (data not shown). Regarding the
production of other 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals using
chelating groups, further studies are required to develop more useful
eluents with high reaction efficiency. Nevertheless, our study suggests
that Sepha(15)-MG is a promising adsorbent for the effective 68Ge/68Ga generator and may be useful in clinical
practice.

Conclusions
Sephadex-based 68Ge adsorbents were prepared from the
Sephadex series without complicated procedures. Seventy to eighty
percent of the 68Ga in Sepha(15)-MG columns was eluted
in 1 mL of the eluate, and the 68Ge breakthrough was <0.001%.
No remarkable changes in the elution efficiency of 68Ga
were observed at 244 days after absorption of 68Ge, suggesting
that our generator could provide a long shelf life. We demonstrated
that generator-eluted 68Ga-citrate can be directly used
for PET imaging of infectious mouse models. Our polysaccharide-based 68Ge/68Ga generators are prospectively cost-effective
production systems for 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
All reagents were commercial
products and used without further purification unless otherwise indicated.
Sephadex beads {G-10 (particle size distribution, 40–120 μm),
G-15 (40–120 μm), G-25 (20–80 μm), G-50
(20–80 μm), G-50 (40–120 μm)} were purchased
from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). 68GeCl4 was obtained from Isotope Products Lab, (Valencia, CA).67Ga-citrate and 18F-FDG were purchased from Nihon Medi-Physics
Co., Ltd. (Chiba, Japan). An automated γ counter with a NaI(Tl)
detector (2470 WIZARD2, PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT) was used
to measure the radioactivity of 68Ga samples. The solutions
in the 68Ge/68Ga generator were moved with a
MP-3 peristaltic pump (EYELA, Tokyo Rikakikai Co., Tokyo, Japan).

Preparation of Sepha-MGs
Sephadex beads (G-10, 3.9
g; G-15, 3.2 g; G-25, 2.2 g; G-50, 0.8 g; and G-75, 0.5 g) were added
to 10 mL of distilled water and degassed. After the supernatants have
been removed, 10 mL of 1 M NaOH was added to the residue, and the
mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Epichlorohydrin
(1 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 120 rpm for 24 h.
After the supernatant had been removed by decantation, the resins
were washed with distilled water three times. MG (2 g) was added in
20 mL of 0.5 M carbonate–bicarbonate buffer (pH 10), and the
mixture was stirred at 120 rpm for 24 h. The resulting mixtures were
washed with distilled water three times and stored in 0.01 M phosphate
buffer until use.

Measurement of Nonradioactive Ge Adsorption
on the Sepha-MGs
A solution of nonradioactive Ge(IV) was
prepared by dissolving
germanium dioxide in a small volume of 0.1 M NaOH. The concentration
and the initial pH were, respectively, adjusted to 0.01 M and 7 with
0.01 M HCl and 0.01 M phosphate buffer. The binding capacity of Sepha-MG
for Ge(IV) was determined by the batch operation method. Fifty milligrams
of Sepha-MGs was shaken for 24 h at 30 °C with 10 mL of 0.01
M Ge(IV). The contents of Ge(IV) in the supernatant were colorimetrically
measured using phenylfluorone.28 The nitrogen
content of the Sepha-MGs was determined by elemental analysis.

Adsorption
of 68Ge onto the Sepha-MGs by the Batch
Method
Each stocked Sepha-MG in 0.01 M phosphate buffer was
washed with H2O five times and then freeze-dried. Sepha-MGs
or Diaion CRB-02 (5 mg; Mitsubishi Chemical, Yokohama, Japan) were
shaken in a glass vial with 2 mL of 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7)
containing 1.5 kBq of 68GeCl4 at room temperature
for 1 h. Then, 100 μL of supernatant was collected, and 48 h
after standing, the radioactivity was compared to that of a standard
solution taken from the equilibrium mixture before incubation with
each adsorbent.

Separation of 68Ga from 68Ge
Half milliliter of Sepha-MGs or CRB-02 presoaked in 0.01
M phosphate
buffer (pH 7) was packed in a teflon-made column (5 cm length, 0.8
cm internal diameter; Flon Chemical, Inc., Osaka, Japan). Then, 5
mL of 68Ge (3.7 MBq for preliminary assessment and 74 MBq
for optimizing Sepha-MG items) in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) was
passed through the column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at room temperature.
After being washed with 0.01 M phosphate buffer, the 68Ga in the column was eluted with the trisodium citrate solution at
a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The elution profiles of 68Ga
and the total yield of 68Ga were characterized by measuring
the 68Ga activity in each 1 mL aliquot of eluate and normalizing
counts to the end of the elution procedure. 68Ga elution
efficiency was expressed as a percentage of the amount of 68Ge contained in the resins at the time of elution. The leakage of 68Ge from the columns was determined by re-counting the eluates
at 48 h after collection.

Analysis of the Generator-Eluted 68Ga Solution by
Cellulose Acetate Electrophoresis
The 68Ga solution
eluted with 0.1 M trisodium citrate from the Sepha(15)-MG generator
was electrophoresed on a Separax SP (Joko, Tokyo, Japan) cellulose
acetate membrane at a constant current of 4.8 mA/cm for 30 min in
72 mM veronal buffer (pH 8.6). The cellulose acetate membrane was
dried under a stream of cold air and placed in contact with imaging
plates (BAS-MS 2040; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) for 10 min. The distribution
of the radioactivity on the plates was analyzed by a FLA5100 fluoro
image analyzer (Fuji Film).

Animals
BALB/c mice were purchased
from SLC (Shizuoka,
Japan). The 129 strain background α/β interferon receptor
knockout (IFNAR-KO) mice (A129 mice) were purchased from B & K
Universal Limited. All mice were maintained in the Laboratory Animal
Center for Animal Research at Nagasaki University. The experiments
with animals were conducted in accordance with our institutional guidelines
and were approved by the Nagasaki University Animal Care Committee
(approval number: 1003240836-4). The infectious animal experiments
were conducted under biosafety level 3 containment in accordance with
institutional guidelines.

Preparation of Leishmania-Infected Mice
BALB/c mice at the age of 8–14 weeks
were infected by subcutaneous
injection of stationary state promastigotes (5 × 106) of L. major (MHOM/SU/73-5-ASKH strain)
in the left hind footpad as described previously.29 The right hind footpad was injected with sterile PBS. The Leishmania-infected mice underwent PET studies 6 days after
infection.

Preparation of SFTS-Infected Mice
Adult A129 mice were
subcutaneously inoculated with 106 focus-forming units
of the SFTSV diluted in Eagle’s minimal essential medium containing
2% fetal bovine serum.30

PET/CT Imaging
of Infected Mice with 68Ga-Citrate
and 18F-FDG
PET/CT images of Leishmania-infected mice (BALB/c, 8 week old, male, 17.5–20.8 g, n = 4), SFTSV-infected mice (IFNAR-KO, 8 week old, male,
16.3–26.5 g, n = 4), and control mice injected
with sterile medium (IFNAR-KO, 8 week old, male, 22.6–29.4
g, n = 4) were acquired with a Triumph combined PET/SPECT/CT
system (TriFoil Imaging Inc., CA). Generator-eluted 68Ga-citrate
was diluted with 1.3× volume of H2O to adjust the
osmotic pressure. Each mouse was administered 68Ga-citrate
(4.5–6.0 MBq) or 18F-FDG (10.5–12.5 MBq)
in the tail vein. The mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane,
and the CT acquisitions were performed for anatomical reference. Subsequently,
1 h 68Ga PET acquisitions commenced 2 h after injection
of 68Ga-citrate or 30 min 18F acquisitions commenced
30 min after injection of 18F-FDG. The PET data were reconstructed
using a three-dimensional maximum-likelihood expectation maximization
algorithm (Iteration30). Acquired PET and CT data were processed,
and PET images were quantified using OsiriX MD software (Pixmeo, Geneva,
Switzerland). Tracer uptake was expressed as the standardized uptake
value (SUV), which was calculated as follows
