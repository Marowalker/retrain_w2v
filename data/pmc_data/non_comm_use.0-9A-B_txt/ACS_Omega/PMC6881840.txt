Core–shell
nanostructures are promising platforms for combination
drug delivery. However, their complicated synthesis process, poor
stability, surface engineering, and low biocompatibility are major
hurdles. Herein, a carboxymethyl chitosan-coated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (cmcPLGA) core–shell nanostructure
is prepared via a simple one-step nanoprecipitation self-assembly
process. Engineered core–shell nanostructures are tested for
combination delivery of loaded docetaxel and doxorubicin in a cancer-mimicked
environment. The drugs are compartmentalized in a shell (doxorubicin,
Dox) and a core (docetaxel, Dtxl) with loading contents of ∼1.2
and ∼2.06%, respectively. Carboxymethyl chitosan with both
amine and carboxyl groups act as a polyampholyte in diminishing ζ-potential
of nanoparticles from fairly negative (−13 mV) to near neutral
(−2 mV) while moving from a physiological pH (7.4) to an acidic
tumor pH (6) that can help the nanoparticles to accumulate and release
the drug on-site. The dual-drug formulation was found to carry a clinically
comparable 1.7:1 weight ratio of Dtxl/Dox, nanoengineered for the
sequential release of Dox followed by Dtxl. Single and engineered
combinatorial nanoformulations show better growth inhibition toward
three different cancer cells compared to free drug treatment. Importantly,
Dox–Dtxl cmcPLGA nanoparticles scored synergism with combination
index values between 0.2 and 0.3 in BT549 (breast ductal carcinoma),
PC3 (prostate cancer), and A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) cell lines,
demonstrating significant cell growth inhibition at lower drug concentrations
as compared to single-drug control groups. The observed promising
performance of dual-drug formulation is due to the G2/M phase arrest
and apoptosis.

Introduction
Cancer is a notorious
disorder that can find loopholes in its basic
molecular mechanisms to bypass various signaling pathways, which are
hit by small molecule therapeutics. This is one of the ways to evolve
toward prolonged survival and metastasis.1 Cancer chemoresistance is due to the increased expression of P-glycoprotein
(Pgp) drug efflux pumps, enhanced drug metabolism, or altered structure
of the drug targets.2 Combination chemotherapy
plays a crucial role in cancer treatment due to rising concerns over
resistance to single-drug regimen over the course of time.3 This approach limits the cancer cells to undergo
mutational changes needed for cancer cell adaptation and can invoke
synergism between the drugs to increase therapeutic efficiency and
target selectivity.4 Due to variations
in pharmacokinetics, membrane transport, and biodistribution properties
of different chemotherapeutics, dosage and optimization of drug scheduling
become highly difficult.5 Additionally,
with more drugs added to the combination module, risks of side effects
increase. Nanoengineering can spatially isolate and encapsulate multiple
therapeutics at the same time to deliver them simultaneously or sequentially
according to various physiological or external stimuli.6,7 While codelivery of different single-drug-loaded nanoparticles is
possible, importance needs to be given to multidrug-containing particles
as they offer vehicle uniformity and ratiometric drug loading with
a temporal release of the drugs. There are various reports on multidrug
delivery using nanoparticles that showed promise in both in vitro
and preclinical stages,8,9 liposomes are considered as an
ideal drug delivery platform for stimuli-responsive targeted drug
delivery applications.10 So far, several
liposomal formulations of drugs such as doxorubicin (Doxil), daunorubicin
(DaunoXome), cytarabine (DepoCyt), and vincristine (ONCO-TCS) have
been marketed successfully. Due to their vesicular structure, they
can load hydrophobic drugs in their unilamellar or multilamellar walls
and a hydrophilic drug in their aqueous core. However, poor stability
and fragile structure are the major limitations of liposome-based
nanoplatforms.10,11 Alternatively, polymer-based
nanoparticles have been utilized as promising platforms for drug delivery
applications due to their predominant stability, low size polydispersity,
tunable physicochemical properties, and better loading capacity for
poorly water-soluble drugs.7,12 Coencapsulation of
drugs in polymeric nanoparticles is possible by directly loading water-insoluble
molecules in the hydrophobic core, compartmentalizing the core by
incorporating a “shell” on the surface for loading a
hydrophilic/hydrophobic drug combination, or covalently conjugating
different drugs in the polymer chain backbone. A recent work showed
the encapsulation of a hydrophobic drug docetaxel in the core with
a hydrophilic polymer covalently attached on the surface of doxorubicin.13 While coencapsulation in the core has little
control over the release pattern of the structurally and chemically
different drugs, compartmentalized encapsulation provide the option
of temporal control with simultaneous or sequential release of the
drugs. A recent work validates a compartmentalized drug delivery carrier,
where the core is made up of a self-assembled starch-based polymer
encapsulating apogossypolone, an anticancer resistance drug, and the
shell is decorated with hyaluronic acid nanoparticle loaded with doxorubicin,
both associated electrostatically.14 In
another report, hydrophobic combretastatin A4 and the hydrophilic
doxorubicin drugs are encapsulated separately in the core and shell
of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/poly(lactic/glycolic acid) (PVP/PLGA) and
poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)/PLGA nanoparticles.15 While there are other promising reports in recent years
on simple yet effective combinatorial nanomedicines,16−27 it is imperative to fabricate a novel multidrug nanoformulation
that can compartmentalize small molecules during a facile synthesis
procedure that can be easily scaled up.

The present work explores
the pH-dependent surface charge switching
carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)-coated PLGA (cmcPLGA) core–shell
nanoparticles encapsulating doxorubicin in the shell and docetaxel
in the core prepared using a facile one-pot nanoprecipitation cum
self-assembly process. The typical synthesis of cmcPLGA nanoparticle
is shown schematically in Figure 1. The method involves in situ formation of core–shell
morphology and compartmentalized docetaxel (Dtxl) and doxorubicin
(Dox) loading. The drug loading is driven by hydrophobic interactions
between Dtxl and PLGA, while Dox and CMC interact electrostatically. Figure 1 also clearly shows
the encapsulation of Dox in a cmcPLGA core–shell microparticle,
which is otherwise difficult to be visualized in the nanoregime.

Results and Discussion
Rationale for CarboxyMethyl
Chitosan as a Shell
Chitosan in its unmodified
form was initially explored to serve as a shell on a PLGA nanoparticle
due to its positive charge, and it could enhance cellular uptake due
to the charge effect.28 However, the main
purpose of loading a second drug in the shell was not achieved due
to a very less doxorubicin encapsulation efficiency of only ∼5%.
The main reason could be due to an irregular coating throughout the
sample, which is carried out after the PLGA nanoparticle synthesis,
causing undesirable nanoparticle aggregation. It was hypothesized
that the problem can be solved if the coating is carried out in situ
during PLGA nanoprecipitation; yet, chitosan could not be used due
to its poor aqueous solubility and the further instability of the
PLGA nanodroplets formed if the process was performed in an acidic
pH. To address this issue, a water-soluble form of chitosan is required
to be used. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) is a well-warranted polymer
that has been widely studied because of its ease of synthesis, cost
effectiveness, and ampholytic character possessing both cationic (amine)
and anionic (carboxyl) functional groups that has made researchers
exploring it as a drug delivery carrier and hydrogel in tissue engineering.29 CMC can be synthesized in various forms predominantly
as N,O-CMC or O-CMC, with “O” and “N”
representing the hydroxyl substitution and amine substitution with
the carboxymethyl group, respectively. The current work needed as
many amine groups intact as possible for the electrostatic interaction
of CMC with the anionic surface of PLGA nanodroplets during the synthesis
process.

Characterization of Carboxymethyl Chitosan
Prior to
nanoparticle preparation, the as-synthesized carboxymethyl chitosan
was first characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and 1H NMR spectroscopy techniques. FTIR spectra shown in Figure 2A depict peaks at
1080 cm–1 corresponding to the glycosidic bond C–O–C
and C–O stretching. The peak at 1400 cm–1 corresponds to carboxymethyl group, and the peak at 1745 cm–1 indicates the carboxyl group. The broad peak at 3455
cm–1 is due to the axial stretching of O–H
and N–H bonds in chitosan.

Figure 2 (A) FTIR spectra of chitosan (a), carboxymethyl
chitosan (b), and
monochloroacetic acid (c). (B) 1H NMR spectra of carboxymethyl
chitosan (i) and chitosan (ii) with respective structures.

The 1H NMR spectrum of CMC (Figure 2B) in D2O at 300 MHz shows a chemical
shift at δ1.9, which corresponds to protons of the acetamido
group (NHCOCH3) in chitosan. Broad resonance between 4
and 4.5 ppm corresponds to protons of O–CH2COOD.22 The appearance of a new signal at 3 ppm corresponds
to protons from the NH–CH2COOD group between 3 and
3.5 ppm, which means the partial presence of N,O-CMC in the polymer.30

Morphology and Surface Chemistry of the Shell
To evaluate
the stability of the blank nanoparticles, dynamic light scattering
and ζ-potential measurements were recorded at varying pH values.
Due to its ampholytic nature, carboxymethyl chitosan displayed a positive
surface charge in the acidic medium owing to the protonation of amine
groups and a negative charge at near-neutral and alkaline media due
to deprotonation at amine and carboxyl groups. The isoelectric point
was found to lie between 5 and 6, with significant particle instability
found in this range, as observed from the increased size (600–750
nm) and high polydispersity index (PDI) due to aggregation with ζ-potential
values from −3 to +2 mV, as shown in Figure 3. This near-neutral charge of the nanoparticles
at a pH range of 5.5–6 can significantly influence the preferential
adherence due to the partial presence of amine groups followed by
accumulation and drug release in an acidic tumor microenvironment.31

of blank cmcPLGA nanoparticles at varying pH conditions. The blue
highlighted area shows the pH range where the isoelectric point of
the nanoparticles lies.

Fabrication of Dual-Drug-Loaded
Nanoformulations
The
blank core–shell cmcPLGA nanoparticles synthesized were about
80 nm in size, with a shell width of ∼5 nm as observed by transmission
electron microscopy TEM) analysis, as shown in Figure S2. The hydrodynamic size was measured to be about
200 nm. The dual-drug-loaded nanoparticles also showed a core–shell
morphology in TEM analysis with a size of ∼100 nm (Figure 4).

(A) and Dtxl (B) loaded cmcPLGA nanoparticles
(inset scale bar, 20 nm). Hydrodynamic diameter, intensity-weighted
size distribution, and ζ-potential measurements of single- and
dual-drug formulations.

Drug loading significantly
affected the PLGA nanoparticle size
when compared to that of blank nanoparticles, as shown in Figure S3. Among three different drugs analyzed
for encasing in the core, docetaxel showed better encapsulation (∼94%)
compared to that of tamoxifen citrate (∼15%) and doxorubicin
(∼17.5%) due to its proven hydrophobic interaction with PLGA.32 Doxorubicin, when loaded into the shell, caused
a reduction in the hydrodynamic size and ζ-potential of the
final core–shell nanoparticle at pH 7.4, from 250 to 200 nm
and −16.7 to −8.88 mV, respectively (Figure 4). A simultaneous reduction
in size and ζ-potential in the presence of Dox could be related
to the compaction effect provided by the Dox-CMC shell and the positively
charged Dox, masking the negative carboxyl groups of CMC. The charge
masking effect of Dox is in line with a previous report, which showed
conjugation of the drug with hyaluronic acid, flipping the surface
charge from negative to positive.14 Size
reduction also decreased the encapsulation efficiency of Dtxl to ∼65%
(Table 1) in the presence
of Dox.

While a previous work has reported Dox-loaded CMC nanoparticles
for nanodrug delivery,33 in the present
work it is vital to optimize the CMC concentration at which better
Dox loading is possible in the shell of the nanoparticles. An increase
in Dox encapsulation (∼55%) with the increase in CMC concentration
up to 0.25% w/v was observed, beyond which the nanoparticle yield
reduced drastically, adversely affecting the drug loading as can be
seen in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Percent
Dox encapsulation under different CMC concentrations (A)
(inset, UV–visible spectra of Dox extracted from the nanoparticles
prepared with different weight percentages of CMC). Percent Dox loading
with and without the CMC coating (B).

A higher Dox loading was noted in the presence of CMC (∼1.2%
with Dtxl and ∼1.6% without Dtxl) compared to the Dox loading
in the absence of CMC (∼0.5% with Dtxl and ∼0.7% without
Dtxl), as shown in Figure 5B, due to the electrostatic interaction of more Dox molecules
with CMC. Dox loading seen in the absence of CMC is due to its interaction
with carboxyl and hydrophobic functional groups in the superficial
layers of PLGA that can also occur in the presence of CMC, aiding
better loading.

Drug Release Kinetics
A sequential
drug release was
observed with a faster Dox release than Dtxl owing to its presence
in the shell with a lesser resistance from CMC, smaller distance to
diffuse out, and hydrophilicity that help in moving toward the aqueous
medium at pH 7.4. Both the drugs showed a biphasic release pattern
with a burst within the first hour followed by a short saturation
with a lagged release till sixth hour after which it reached a steady
state (Figure 6). The
second saturation was not observed in the case of Dtxl when loaded
as a single drug in the nanoparticles, possibly due to the absence
of resistance from the electrostatically cross-linked Dox-CMC shell.
This resistance is also expected to limit the overall release of both
the drugs in the dual-drug formulation under normal physiological
conditions. The presence of ∼80% of Dtxl and ∼55% of
Dox in the nanoparticle at the end of 24 h provides for the release
of the remaining cargo after being uptaken by the cancer cells.

nanoparticles.

Engineered Nanoformulation
for Cancer Cell Growth Inhibition
The effect of single- and
dual-drug formulations was assessed in
three different cell lines, viz., BT549 (breast ductal carcinoma),
PC3 (prostate cancer), and A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), each being
different in their tissue of origin. These cell lines were selected
to observe the toxicity of formulation on the basis of the proliferation
index of the cells. Both cancer cell lines BT549 and PC3 are indicated
in opposite sexes, female and male, respectively, with closer proliferation
indexes of 2.3 and 2.1.34,35 The A549 cancer cells
are indicated as common for both sexes with a proliferation index
of 1.1,36 which is about half of the other
two cell lines. The dual-drug formulation was found to carry ∼1.7:1
weight ratio of Dtxl/Dox at the optimized conditions nanoengineered
for a sequential release of Dox followed by Dtxl. The clinically correlated
ratio ranges from 1.2:1 to 1.5:1, depending upon study objectives
with sequential administration of Dox followed by Dtxl in metastatic
breast cancer patients.37,38 The core–shell
nanoparticles showed time-dependant uptake in cancer cells with significant
accumulation in the cytoplasm at the end of 6 h incubation (Figure S4). The free drug response at end of
48 h incubation was found to differ for each of the cell lines with
BT459 requiring a maximum free Dox concentration of about 1.934 μg/mL
(3.56 μM) to reach IC50 (Figure 7) followed by PC3 (1.812 μg/mL; 3.33 μM)
and A549 (0.253 μg/mL; 0.465 μM). In the case of free
Dtxl, A549 showed a cytostatic effect scoring the maximum IC50 of
5.716 μg/mL (7.09 μM) followed by a dose-dependent growth
inhibitory effect for both BT549 and PC3 with IC50 values of 1.15
and 0.266 μM, respectively. Nanoformulations showed better growth
inhibition compared to that of free drug formulations. While single-drug
nanoformulation had a prominent effect at higher concentrations, dual-drug
nanoformulation showed significant cell growth inhibition even at
lower drug concentrations, mainly due to their synergistic effect
(Figure 7). The IC50
values of the dual-drug formulation were found to be as low as 5 ng/mL
(Dox equivalent, 9.2 nM) and 7 ng/mL (Dtxl equivalent, 8.68 nM) in
A549 cell line. As expected, the IC50 values were higher in BT549
(Dox equivalent, 44.23 nM and Dtxl equivalent, 62 nM) and PC3 (Dox
equivalent, 22 nM and Dtxl equivalent, 33.5 nM) cells owing to their
high proliferation index. The combination Index that predicts whether
a two-drug therapeutic regime follows synergism (C.I. < 1), additive
(C.I. = 1), or antagonism (C.I. > 1) showed synergism in the case
of Dox–Dtxl cmcPLGA nanoparticles with values between 0.2 and
0.3 for all of the three cell lines (Table 2). A comparative chart of Dox and Dtxl IC50
values in the three cell lines with the previously reported values
is tabulated in Table S1.

Cell Cycle Analysis
Acridine orange and ethidium bromide
(AO/EtBr) staining of PC3 prostate cancer cells showed chromatin breakdown,
as can be seen in Figure 8, a characteristic feature of apoptosis, and it was prominent
in cells treated with the dual-drug formulation (Dox, 50 ng/mL; Dtxl,
100 ng/mL) than cells treated with free and single-drug formulations,
each at a concentration of 100 ng/mL. Our results clearly showed that
Dox augmented the cytotoxic effects of Dtxl, which was further validated
by cell cycle analysis. Dtxl and Dox are known to inhibit the cell
cycle at the G2/M phase.39,40 Dox–Dtxl combination
formulation profoundly (>80%) inhibited the cells at the G2/M phase
compared to single-drug formulations (Figure 9).

Conclusions
We
report nanoparticles made of a PLGA core and a carboxymethyl
chitosan shell with a pH-specific change in surface charge and compartmentalized
dual-drug loading using a one-pot synthesis procedure. Nanoparticle
characterization showed visible CMC coating with Dtxl (core) and Dox
(shell) encapsulation of 94 and 55%, respectively. Due to the polyampholytic
nature of CMC, the synthesized core–shell nanoparticles were
found to have a positive and negative surface charge at acidic and
alkaline pH values, respectively, with the isoelectric point lying
between pH values of 5 and 6. The drug release profile showed a sequential
release of Dox followed by Dtxl at physiological pH (7.4). The cell
growth inhibitory effect of dual-drug formulation was significantly
higher than that of free drug and single-drug nanoformulations. The
combination drug delivery showed synergism between the two drugs,
thus proving efficient than the control groups. While herein we report
a combinatorial nanomedicine, the potential of the technology to fabricate
layered microparticles to serve as postsurgical local implants for
controlled sequential drug delivery cannot be ruled out. In both cases,
a comprehensive in vivo study would fetch more light to establish
the efficiency of the combination drug delivery in preclinical tumor
models.

bromide (MTT), acridine orange, propidium iodide, and ethidium bromide
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd. PLGA (17 kDa, 50:50) was provided
by PURAC Biomaterials. Monocloroacetic acid and polyvinyl alcohol
were purchased from S.D. Fine Chemicals Ltd. RNAse A was purchased
from Invitrogen. Cell lines PC3 and A549 were procured from NCCS,

serum (FBS), DMEM, RPMI1640, penicillin–streptavidin solution,
and trypsin EDTA were purchased from HiMedia Ltd. All solvents used
were of analytical grade.

Synthesis of CarboxyMethyl Chitosan
The synthesis of
CMC was as per protocol reported by Zhu et al.29 Chitosan (8% w/v) was immersed in 25 mL of NaOH (50% w/v)
solution to swell for 24 h. The alkalized chitosan was crushed into
a filtration cake and then transferred into a flask. Five grams of
monochloroacetic acid was dissolved in 25 mL of isopropanol and then
added to the flask dropwise for 20 min. The reaction in the flask
was allowed to continue for 8 h at room temperature, after which the
mixture was filtered to remove the solvent. The filtrate obtained
was dissolved in 100 mL of water, and 2.5 M HCl was added to it to
adjust its pH to ∼7. Following pH adjustments, anhydrous ethanol
was added to precipitate the product that is further centrifuged to
remove the precipitate. Finally, the product was filtered, rinsed
thrice with anhydrous ethanol, and vacuum-dried at room temperature.

Synthesis of Dual-Drug loaded Carboxymethyl chitosan-Coated
PLGA (cmcPLGA) Nanoparticles
The core–shell nanoparticles
was prepared using a single-step nanoprecipitation self-assembly process
by slowly adding 5 mL of organic phase (tetrahydrofuran) containing
5 mg/mL PLGA (17 kDa, 50:50) and docetaxel (10% w/w of PLGA) into
10 mL of aqueous mixture containing previously synthesized carboxymethyl
chitosan (0.25% w/v), doxorubicin hydrochloride (10% w/w of CMC),
and PVA (2% w/v) under vigorous stirring followed by solvent evaporation
at room temperature. After complete solvent evaporation, the nanoparticles
were separated from excess PVA by centrifugation at 15 000
rpm for 30 min and further washed once with double distilled water
at 15 000 rpm for 10 min. The nanoparticles were dispersed
in double distilled water at 1 mg/mL concentration prior to freeze-drying
and stored at 4 °C until further use.

Drug Encapsulation and
Loading Studies
A known quantity
of Dox–Dtxl-loaded nanoparticles were dispersed in water–acetonitrile
mixture and left for drug dissolution into the solution phase under
constant shaking overnight. The mixture was centrifuged to remove
polymer debris, and the supernatant was analyzed using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) for doxorubicin and docetaxel absorbance
at λmax of 230 nm with retention times of 6.06 and
7.118 min, respectively (Figure S1). This
method was used to directly measure the amount of the drug loaded
in the particles. The EE (encapsulation efficiency) and LC (loading
content) of drugs were calculated using the following formulas    

Drug Release Study
The dual-drug release study from
cmcPLGA nanoparticles was performed by a dialysis membrane method for the samples against
1% Tween 80 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Predetermined
quantities of aliquots were taken from the release medium at regular
time intervals and replaced with an equal volume of fresh buffer to
maintain constant sink conditions. The aliquots were quantified for
both docetaxel and doxorubicin using HPLC as mentioned earlier. The
measurements were performed in triplicate for calculating mean ±
standard deviation.

Cell Growth Inhibition Studies
To
elucidate the effect
of unloaded and Dox–Dtxl-loaded cmcPLGA nanoparticles on cancer
cells, the MTT assay was performed according to the method reported
by Mallavadhani et al.41 A549 and PC3 cells
were cultured in RPMI1640, and BT549 cells were cultured in DMEM.
Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin,
and streptomycin. Briefly, A549, PC3, and BT549 cells were seeded
at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well
plate containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were treated with different
concentrations of free drug, dual-drug, and single-drug nanoformulations
for a period of 48 h. At the end of incubation, 10 μL of MTT
(5 mg/mL) in 100 μL medium was added and incubated at 37 °C
for 4 h. Then, the media with MTT was removed and the purple formazan
crystals formed were dissolved in 200 μL of dimethyl sulphoxide
and read at 570 nm using a multidetection plate reader (SpectraMax
M4, Molecular Devices, USA). The cell inhibitory efficiency and dual-drug
combination index were calculated as follows  where Asample and Acontrol are absorbance values
of nanoparticle-treated and untreated cells,
respectively.  where D1 and D2 are
drug concentration of Dox and Dtxl, respectively, and D50a and D50b are 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values
of Dox formulation and Dtxl formulation, respectively.

Acridine orange
and Ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr)
AO/EtBr
staining was performed for imaging apoptotic chromatin breakdown in
treated cells according to the method reported by Mallavadhani et al.41 PC3 cells were grown in 6-well plates
for 24 h followed by treatment with the samples for 24 h. After the
incubation period, the cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for
30 min and observed under a inverted fluorescence microscope with
the help of a digital camera (Nikon, Inc. 246 Japan) at 200X magnification.

Cell Cycle Analysis
To determine the effect of Dox,
Dtxl, and Dox–Dtxl formulations on cell cycle analysis, 24
h after plating 1 × 106 PC3 cells on 6-well plates,
cells were incubated with free drug, single, and combination formulations
for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline,
trypsinzed, and fixed in 70% alcohol. After fixing, RNAse A (1 mg/mL)
and PI (10 mg/mL) were added to each sample. Samples were incubated
at room temperature in complete darkness for 30 min. Cell cycle distribution
was determined using BD fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
verse. The results were analyzed by BD FACSuite software.
