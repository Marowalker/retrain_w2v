PMMA-based cements are the most used
bone cements in vertebroplasty
and total hip arthroplasty. However, they present several drawbacks,
including susceptibility to bacterial infection, monomer leakage toxicity,
and high polymerization temperature, which can all lead to damage
to the surrounding tissues and their failure. In the present study,
silver nanowires (AgNWs) have been introduced to bestow antibacterial
properties; chitosan (CS) to promote porosity and to reduce the polymerization
temperature, without negatively affecting the mechanical performance;
and methacryloyl chitosan (CSMCC) to promote cross-linking with methyl
methacrylate (MMA) and reduce the quantity of monomer required for
polymerization. Novel PMMA cements were formulated containing AgNWs
(0 and 1% w/w) and CS or CSMCC at various concentrations (0, 10, 20,
and 30% w/w), testing two different ratios of powder and MMA (P/L).
Mechanical, thermal, antibacterial, and cytotoxic properties of the
resulting composite cements were tested. Cements with concentrations
of CS > 10% presented a significantly reduced polymerization temperature.
The mechanical performances were affected for concentrations >
20%
with a P/L concentration equal to 2:1. Concentrations of AgNWs as
low as 1% w/w conferred antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, whereas biofilm formation on the surface
of the cements was increased when CS was included in the preparation.
The combination of CS and AgNWs allowed a higher concentration of
Ag+ to be released over time with enhanced antimicrobial
activity. Inclusion of AgNWs did not affect cell viability on the
scaffolds. In conclusion, a combination of CS and AgNWs may be beneficial
for reducing both polymerization temperature and biofilm formation,
without significantly affecting mesenchymal stem cell proliferation
on the scaffolds. No advantages have been noticed as a result of the
reducing P/L ratio or using CSMCC instead of CS.

==== Body
Introduction
Poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) is currently the most common bone
cement used as a screw, prosthesis, or implant fixator in bone, filler
for bone cavities or skull defects, and vertebroplasty in osteoporotic
patients.1 PMMA beads are combined with
the liquid monomer (methyl methacrylate, MMA) to form a slurry that,
once injected, conforms to the shape of its surrounding, allowing
the distribution of implant loads and the formation of strong mechanical
bonds with bone following monomer polymerization. Notwithstanding
its extensive application, PMMA use is hindered by a number of limitations:
lack of bioactivity, poor cement–bone integration, stiffness
mismatch between the bone and the cement, high exothermic reaction
temperature that can cause tissue necrosis, and monomer toxicity characterized
by a sudden drop in blood pressure.2 Moreover,
it has been reported that MMA can cause allergic reactions through
direct contact with the skin (dermatitis) or through inhalation.3 Finally, an important risk related to any biomaterial
implantation is the occurrence of infections that can lead to biofilm
formation and implant failure.4,5

One strategy,
employed to promote better PMMA bone integration,
is to increase the cement porosity with the addition of biodegradable
materials. For instance, chitosan can degrade, over time, leaving
a rough and porous three-dimensional (3D) structure in which the bone
can grow, promoting a more stable fixation thanks to the improved
interlocking between the bone and cement.6 A further advantage of the use of additives in bone cements is their
potential to dissipate the heat generated from the polymerization
reaction, minimizing the risk of bone necrosis; glycidyl methacrylate
(GMA) and trimethoxysilyl propyl methacrylate (3MPMA) have been used
to reduce polymerization temperature.7 Alternatively,
the functionalization of chitosan with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA)
to promote cross-linking with MMA can have a similar effect.7

Implantation of PMMA can be complicated
by the occurrence of osteomyelitis,
a bacterial infection of the bone frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus.8 Infection can lead to the destruction of the bone and consequently
to increased rates of treatment failure.9 Since more and more bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics,10 attention has been shifting to alternatives
provided by nanotechnology, such as silver nanowires (AgNWs). For
example, oleic acid-capped AgNWs (5.3 ± 2.3 nm) loaded into PMMA-based
cements showed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S.
aureus, at low concentrations of 0.05%.11 Slane et al. formulated a PMMA bone cement loaded
with silver NPs (30–50 nm) functionalized with poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
at concentrations 0.25, 0.5, and 1%. No antibacterial activity was
found in suspension, but all concentrations of AgNPs were able to
significantly reduce biofilm growth on the scaffold.12 However, all of these systems presented a critical problem
related to the extremely poor biodegradability and interconnectivity
of PMMA. If the plastic does not degrade, silver will not come in
contact with physiological fluids, oxidize, and have an effect on
the bacterial cells.

In the present work, we report the preparation
and characterization
of novel PMMA composites containing chitosan (CS) or methacryloyl
chitosan (CSMCC) to reduce polymerization temperature, modify mechanical
behavior, and favor the formation of pores, and AgNWs that can offer
a prolonged antibacterial effected by a controlled silver ion release,
more sustained than spherical nanoparticles.13,14 We further investigated the cytocompatibility, antibacterial, and
mechanical properties of the composites.

Materials and Methods
Materials
DePuy SmartSet MV medium viscosity bone cement
was purchased from eSutures.com (Mokena, IL). Chitosan from shrimp
shell low viscosity (Mn 149.9 ± 4.7
kDa, Mw 170.5 ± 4.9 kDa as determined
by GPC-MALLS, degree of deacetylation ∼85%, calculated by 1H NMR), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) powder (55 kDa), and all other
reagents, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Irvine, UK). DMEM high glucose with glutaMAX and phenol red, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
dihydrochloride (DAPI), glycerol, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
isopropanol, MTT, PBS pH 7.4, phalloidin Dylight 550, trypan blue
stain, silver nitrate, trypsin 0.25% EDTA with phenol red, and ×100
penicillin/streptomycin were from Fisher (Loughborough, UK). ATPlite
Luminescence ATP detection assay system was purchased from PerkinElmer
(Coventry, UK). Deuterium chloride (D, 99.5%, DCL 20%), deuterium
oxide (D, 99.9%), and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (D, 99.9%) + 0.05% v/v tetramethylsilane (TMS) were purchased from
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA).

Synthesis and
Characterization of CSMCC
Chitosan (CS,
2 g) was homogeneously dispersed in methanesulfonic acid (11 mL) at
0 °C with overhead stirring for 2 h. Methacryloyl chloride (MCC,
12 mL) was then added dropwise into the chitosan dispersion, and the
light brown reaction mixture was further stirred for 4 h at 0 °C
in the dark. The reaction mixture was poured into cold water, and
a light cream precipitate was obtained after neutralization with aqueous
ammonia (35% v/v). The precipitate was dialyzed against deionized
water for 1 day, and the solid was recovered by centrifugation at
2880g for 20 min at room temperature (×3); the
pellet was vacuum-dried at 40 °C and then pulverized to afford
a fine powder.

FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Varian FT-IR
640-IR Instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and spectra were processed
using Agilent Resolutions Pro software. For 1H NMR analysis,
CSMCC was dissolved in DMSO-d6 containing
0.5% TMS standard; chitosan was dissolved in D2O:DCl (98:2);
methacryloyl chloride (200 μL) was mixed with 800 μL of
CDCl3. All of the samples were analyzed using a Jeol Eclipse
+ 400 MHz NMR instrument (Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK). The degree
of substitution in the reaction product (DS%) was determined according
to the following formula  where Iv1 and Iv2 are the integral intensities of the signals
assigned to the two vinylic protons present in methacryloyl chloride,
while Ia is the integral intensity of
anomeric proton.15

The powder particle
size was determined by laser diffraction using
a Helos particle sizer coupled with a RODOS dry dispersion unit and
ASPIROS micro dose module (Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany);
a pressure of 2 bar was used for the measurements.

The antibacterial
properties of CS and CSMCC against S. aureus were assessed in suspension. CS and CSMCC
of 10 mg/mL stock suspensions were prepared in sterile lysogeny broth
(LB), further sterilized under UV light overnight, and sonicated for
20 min at 40 Hz before testing. Antibacterial studies were carried
out according to Ardila et al. with some modifications.16S. aureus (ATCC
25923) (106 CFU/mL) was added to CS and CSMCC suspensions
(0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg/mL final concentrations), and the
volume was brought to 2 mL with a sterile LB medium into 8 mL sterile
sealed bottles. After incubation at 37 °C and shaking at 200
rpm for 12 h (MaxQ 8000, Thermo Scientific), the bacterial concentration
was determined by measuring the optical density of the suspension
at 600 nm (OD600nm). Different concentrations of the stock
CS and CSMCC suspensions, as well as pure LB, were used as blanks.
The experiment was carried out in triplicate (n =
3).

Synthesis and Characterization of AgNWs
AgNWs were
synthetized using the polyol method, as previously described.14 AgNWs, with an average length of 5 μm
and an average diameter of 99 nm, were obtained.14

Preparation of Composite PMMA Cements
Cement formulations
with different concentrations of additives and/or powder to liquid
monomer ratio (Table 1) have been prepared and tested. Powders, in the selected ratios,
were uniformly mixed using a vortex (Fisherbrand) and then mixed with
the liquid monomer, at the required P/L ratio, by manual mixing with
a spatula, until the powders were fully wet. If AgNWs were included
in the preparation, freeze-dried AgNWs were suspended in MMA by sonication
for at least 20 min at 40 Hz before mixing with the powders. When
the mixture became dough-like and easier to handle, the whole mixture
was transferred into a custom-made 10-well PTFE mold (6 mm diameter,
12 mm height) and manually pressed. The cements were allowed to cure
for 1 h and then removed from the mold and stored in a desiccator
at room temperature until further use.

Thermal Behavior
Setting temperature
was measured according
to Chen et al. with minor adjustments.17 MMA was added to the powders (3 g) and mixed until the dough was
fully wet. This was placed in plastic containers (3.5 cm diameter
× 1 cm height), and three thermocouples were inserted a few mm
under the surface of the dough to measure and record the temperature
at 5 s intervals for 25 min, using data acquisition software, Pico
Log from Pico Technology. Temperature was plotted vs time to determine
the peak temperature (Tmax) and setting
time (tset). The setting time was the
time point when the exothermic temperature reached the midpoint temperature
between the ambient (Tamb) and the peak
temperatures (Tmax). The setting temperature
was determined using the equation below  

Degradation Studies
The degradability of the composite
cements was evaluated by determining weight loss, water absorbance,
and porosity changes following incubation in PBS. Cement specimens
were immersed in PBS (pH = 7.4) and placed in an incubator at 37 °C
for 4 weeks, shaking at 90 rpm (Grant, Cambridge, UK); the PBS medium
was changed every week. At scheduled time points, samples were removed
and weighed (after the removal of any excess liquid). Samples were
then dried in a vacuum oven at 37 °C for 3 days before measuring
their final weight. Water absorption and weight loss were determined,
applying the equations reported by Kim et al.18 The total porosity and pore size were examined using high-resolution
X-ray computed tomography, XCT (Xradia 520 Versa, Carl Zeiss X-ray
microscopy, CA), and the 3D data was then analyzed with Avizo (9.3.0,
FEI Company). The images were collected using a 60 kVp tube voltage,
a tube current of 84 μA, and with a ZEISS LE1 filter in place.
With an isotropic voxel size of 6.11 μm, 1601 projections were
collected over 360° with an exposure time of 3 s per projection.
After reconstruction, a volume of interest was selected and a threshold
was applied to segment the pores. From the segmented images, the volume
of the pores and the total porosity were calculated. Pores in contact
with the edges of the image were excluded from the analysis. Six samples
per type were tested for weight loss and water uptake. One sample
per type was analyzed three times for porosity and pore size determination.

Mechanical Behavior
Compressive tests were carried
out to evaluate ultimate compressive strength (UCS) and Young’s
modulus (E). Cements were prepared in the shape of
cylinders as described above, ends were sanded, and the diameter and
length were accurately measured using a Vernier caliper. Once cement
cylinders were embedded into metallic end caps with epoxy resin using
a customized alignment system, they were tested at a speed of 0.02
mm/s up to 25% compression (MTS Bionix, MTS Systems Corp., Eden Prairie,
MN). Six samples per cement type were tested, before and after degradation.

Morphological Characterization
The external surfaces
of cements before and after degradation were investigated using a
high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol JSM-6160L).
Samples were gold-coated using a Polaron e500 instrument (Quoram Technologies,
UK). ImageJ (version 1.8.0) software was used to determine the superficial
pore size.

Silver Release Studies
The release
of silver cations
was studied by incubating the cements in 5 mL of HPLC-grade water
at 37 °C with shaking (90 rpm). At scheduled times, 1 mL of supernatant
was taken and substituted with 1 mL of freshwater. The concentration
of silver ions was determined by a furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer
(VarianSpectrAA 220FS) at a wavelength and spectral bandwidth of 328.1
and 0.2 nm, respectively. A calibration curve was prepared by diluting
a silver standard (1 g/L) in deionized water (in the range of 1–5
mg/L).

Biofilm Formation on Cement Surfaces
Cements were directly
prepared in 96-well plates. The day after, they were sterilized by
treating with 70% EtOH for 30 min and washing three times in sterile
water. Then, they were irradiated with UV light in a laminar flow
for 1 h. One hundred microliters of a 1 × 106 CFU/mL
suspension of S. aureus in the LB medium
were plated in each well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The
medium was removed, and each well was gently washed once with PBS
to remove loosely adherent bacteria. An MTT assay was carried out
to quantify the bacteria adhered to the cement surface: 100 μL
of 0.5 mg/mL of the MTT solution in PBS was added to each well, and
the plates were incubated for 1 h in the dark.19 The supernatant was removed, and DMSO was added to dissolve
the formazan salts inside the cells. Then, the violet solutions were
transferred to a new 96-well plate, and the absorbance was read at
570 nm using DMSO as blank. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Cytotoxicity Studies
Primary sheep mesenchymal stem
cells were obtained under project license number PPL70/8247, and ethical
approval was granted by the animal welfare and ethical review board
(AWERB) at the Royal Veterinary College, London, UK. Cells were used
between passages 2 and 5. Cells were grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Cells
were grown until 70% confluence in an incubator at 37 °C and
5% CO2 and then detached with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA.
The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400g for 5
min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5702, UK), and the pellet was resuspended
in media, counted, and seeded onto the cylinders. One day after manufacturing,
cement cylinders were submerged in complete DMEM at a weight-to-volume
ratio of 1:5 and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.20 DMEM was removed and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter
and frozen until further use; these samples were used to test the
biocompatibility of cement extracts. Cells were grown overnight at
a cell density of 5 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well
plate. Then, the medium was removed, and 100 μL of cement extracts
were added to each well followed by incubation for 24 and 48 h. At
these scheduled time points, the medium was removed and an MTT assay
was performed. The cells were plated for 4 h with 0.5 mg/mL MTT in
a complete medium. Then, the medium was removed, and 100 μL/well
of DMSO was added. Absorbance was read at 570 nm using DMSO as blank.
The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Cell proliferation
on the surface of cements was determined using an ATP bioluminescence
assay. Cement cyliders were prepared as described above. Cells (5000
cells/well) were seeded, and their proliferation was measured with
an ATP assay, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(ATPlite, PerkinElmer). Luminescence readings were taken in a 96-well
plate (SpectraMax i3x, Molecular DEVICES). Six replicates per type
were tested.

Morphological studies on cells were carried out
by a fluorescence
microscope after their culture on the cement disks for 24 h. Cells
were fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% in PBS for 15 min, washed with
PBS, permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, washed twice
with PBS, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1
h, washed twice with PBS, stained with Phalloidin Dylight 550 in PBS
(2 units/mL, stock solution of 300 units/mL in methanol) for 1 h (300
μL, at room temperature), washed twice with PBS, stained with
DAPI 2 μg/mL in PBS for 10 min, and finally rinsed again with
PBS. Photographs were taken, using an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss
Axio Imager Z1) equipped with a Hamamatsu HR camera and a color AxioCam
MRc camera. Images were processed by Volocity 6.3 software.

Statistical
Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 7.03 software. Details of the different statistical
tests used are reported in the figure captions.

Results
Physicochemical
Characterization of CSMCC
CSMCC was
synthesized by modifying the primary hydroxyl group in chitosan with
a methacryloyl moiety, via a nucleophilic substitution reaction carried
out in a strongly acidic environment (methanesulfonic acid; pKa = −1.9) (Figure 1A). The unreacted methacryloyl chloride was
removed during the washing steps as methacrylic acid ammonium salt.21 The formation of CSMCC was confirmed by FT-IR
(Figure 1B): the new
peak at 1710 cm–1 is attributed to the C=O
bond in the newly formed ester group. The chemical structure of CSMCC
was also confirmed by 1H NMR (Figure 1C), with vinylic proton signals appearing
at δ 5.71 and 6.02 ppm, and methyl protons corresponding to
the methacryloyl group appearing at δ 1.01 ppm. The 1H NMR spectrum also showed a signal at δ 1.48 ppm from the
three methyl H atoms (N-acetyl glucosamine), a signal
at δ 2.24 ppm from H2 (glucosamine), several overlapping signals
(from δ 1.7 to 2.0 ppm) assigned to H3–H6 connected to
the non-anomeric C3–C6 carbons in the glucopyranose ring, and
δ 2.3 ppm from the anomeric proton. The degree of substitution
of CSMCC was determined as 25.7%.

In the formulation of composite bone cements, the
particle size
and shape of the constituent powders are important to guarantee homogeneous
mixing and dispersion in the liquid monomer. CS and CSMCC particles
presented an irregular shape (Figure S1) and had a significantly higher particle size than the PMMA powder
(p < 0.05, Table 2) that was in the range typically reported for commercial
bone cements.22

Antibacterial Properties
of CS and CSMCC Powders
The
bacteriostatic potential of CS and CSMCC powders was tested against S. aureus by measuring the absorbance of the bacterial
suspension after 12 h of incubation in LB (Figure 2). The compounds were studied in suspension rather than solution
as chitosan and modified chitosan were incorporated in the PMMA cements
as solids and are unlikely to dissolve at physiological pH. While
bacterial growth was detected for all concentrations studied, results
showed that concentrations ≥2 mg/mL were required to significantly
affect bacterial growth. In this respect, no differences were noticed
between the chitosan and modified chitosan.

multiple comparison test are reported in the graph (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001). The t-test performed between CS and CSMCC at different concentrations
revealed no statistical difference (p > 0.05).

Experimental Peak Temperature and Setting

Commercially available acrylic bone cement
is typically activated
by mixing a powder (P) and a liquid component (L) at a P/L ratio of
2:1. The powder is generally composed of PMMA beads, containing a
radical initiator (e.g., benzoyl peroxide) and, when required, a radiopaque
agent (e.g., barium sulfate). The liquid contains the monomer methyl
methacrylate (MMA), a stabilizer (e.g., hydroquinone), and an accelerator
(e.g., N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine) to encourage the polymerization reaction to occur at
room temperature (cold curing cement).

When the two components
are mixed together, the liquid monomer polymerizes around the prepolymerized
PMMA particles (Figure 3) generating heat.23 In this study, we
recorded the polymerization temperature of the composite bone cements
and found that the peak polymerization temperature decreased for all
composites in comparison with that of the PMMA 2:1 control (66.7 ±
8.7 °C) (Figure 4A,B).

PMMA-based cements, containing CS (C) or CSMCC (D), with different
ratios of P/L. Data are reported as a mean ± SD (n = 6). One-way ANOVA returned p < 0.05; results
of the Dunnett’s multicomparison test, used to compare all
of the samples with the PMMA control, and results of the t-test to compare samples with different P/L ratios are reported in
the graph (*p < 0.05, **p <
0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p <
0.0001).

Higher concentrations of CS and
CSMCC (≥20%, in particular)
induced a significant reduction in the polymerization temperature
(CS20%_0.8, p < 0.01; CSMCC20%_1 p < 0.05). On the other hand, when the P/L ratio decreased to 2:0.8,
the exothermic reaction temperature was not statistically different
(p > 0.05). The lowest polymerization temperatures
for CS-enriched cements were recorded for PMMA CS30%_0.8 (45.4 ±
3.4 °C) and PMMA CS30%_AgNWs_0.8 (44.2 ± 1.4 °C), whereas
for CSMCC for PMMA CSMCC30%_0.8 (44.9 ± 7.6 °C) and PMMA
CSMCC30%_AgNWs_1 (45.0 ± 2.5 °C). According to ISO 5833:2002,
the ideal setting time for acrylic resin cements, depending on the
usage, should be between 3 and 15 min. With increasing concentrations
of CS and CSMCC (Figure 4C,D), the setting time increased from 667.2 ± 28.1 s (ca. 11
min) for PMMA_1 to 843.8 ± 2.9 s (ca. 14 min) for PMMA CS30%_1,
remaining within the maximum recommended time. The setting time was
lower when the P/L ratio was higher.

In Vitro Degradation Studies
The porosity and pore
size distribution of composite cements were evaluated by XCT. During
the polymerization process, voids formed as entrapped air was unable
to escape due to the cement paste viscosity. Cements containing biodegradable
materials, such as chitosan, were expected to increase in porosity
over time, and this was also evaluated by XCT. Samples of the PMMA
control and composite cements containing 20% CS or CSMCC were scanned.
The PMMA-CS sample analyzed before degradation showed a significantly
higher porosity than PMMA-only (p < 0.05), whereas
the PMMA_2:1_CSMCC20% was not statistically different. Furthermore,
the cement containing CS and CSMCC underwent degradation during a
4 week incubation period in PBS (p < 0.05), while
no significant degradation was shown in the PMMA-only cements (Figure 5A).

comparing the % pore volume of CS_20% to PMMA before degradation in
PBS; results of the Dunnett’s multiple comparison test are
reported in the graph. One-way ANOVA returned p <

reported in the graph (&&p <

An increase in the pore size after 4 weeks of degradation
was observed
only for PMMA_2:1_CS20% (p < 0.05) with the average
pore size increasing from 11.6 ± 13.4 to 13.1 ± 10.9 μm.
PMMA cements before and after degradation had a narrower pore size
distribution in comparison to the cements containing CS or CSMCC,
both before and after degradation (Figure 5B).

To further assess the composite
cements, in vitro degradation was
evaluated by a gravimetric method. This method is considered the golden
standard for in vitro wear assessment.24 This provides information about global mass loss, though it does
not give any information about the distribution of wear within the
material. As shown in Table 1, PMMA-only cements showed a poor weight loss (0.09 ±
0.09 and 0.12 ± 0.12% for PMMA_2:1 and PMMA_2:0.8, respectively),
whereas CS- and CSMCC-based cements presented higher weight loss,
which increased with the increase of the polysaccharide concentration,
as expected. For instance, the calculated weight loss for PMMA_CS_2:1
samples increased from 0.16 ± 0.25 to 0.68 ± 0.57 and finally
3.66 ± 1.03% for 10, 20, and 30% chitosan contents, respectively.
No statistical difference between the two MMA concentrations was found.
Water absorbance increased with the increase of CS or CSMCC up to
nearly 13% (Table 1). Similar trends are reported in the literature for chitosan-based
polyester and poly(methyl methacrylate) cements.25 This trend can be justified in two different ways: the
presence of chitosan that is hygroscopic and promoted the water absorption
by the scaffold, while this was not possible in PMMA-only cements
that are hydrophobic. Alternatively, higher porosity and/or interconnectivity
of the material, due to chitosan degradation, could promote water
retention within the scaffold (as suggested from XCT). No statistical
difference was determined between CS- and CSMCC-based cements (p < 0.05).

Mechanical Properties
In this study,
we incorporated
increasing mass ratios of CS or CSMCC to study how the mechanical
properties of PMMA cements are affected. Surgical PMMA cement is brittle
in nature. It is therefore weak under tension but quite strong in
compression and is capable of yielding under uniaxial compression.
The compressive strength and elastic modulus of composite cements
generally decreased, increasing the mass ratio of CS or CSMCC in the
mixture (Figure 6).
This trend is in good agreement with Dunne et al. for PMMA bone cements
(Palacos R) loaded with chitosan, at lower concentrations (1, 3, and
5% w/w),26 and Tan et al. who incorporated
20% chitosan into PMMA bone cements (CMW endurance bone cement).27 When AgNWs were included in the formulation,
no statistical differences were reported. This trend has also been
reported by Slane et al., who incorporated 1.0% w/w silver nanoparticles
into acrylic bone cements.12 When the ratio
between the powder and liquid was 2:1, the compressive modulus and
elastic modulus were significantly decreased with the inclusion of
30% CS. This can be attributed to the presence of less chemical links
inside the cements and possibly the presence of loose powder. On the
other hand, when the ratio between the powder and liquid was 2:0.8,
the compressive strength was significantly different also for lower
concentrations of CSMCC (20%).

are reported as a mean ± SD (n = 6). For compressive
strength, one-way ANOVA returned p < 0.05; results
of Dunnett’s multicomparison test (used to compare all of the
samples with the PMMA_2:1) are reported in the graph (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). Unpaired t-test was performed to compare each formulation containing
a weight-to-volume ratio of 2:1 with the respective formulation containing
a weight-to-volume ratio of 2:0.8 ($p <
0.05, $$p < 0.01). For Young’s
modulus, one-way ANOVA returned p < 0.05; results
of Dunnett’s multicomparison test, used to compare all samples
with the PMMA control, are reported in the graph (*p < 0.05). Unpaired t-test was performed to compare
each formulation containing a weight-to-volume ratio of 2:1 with the
respective formulation containing a weight-to-volume ratio of 2:0.8
($p < 0.05).

The mechanical performance was also evaluated after the in vitro
degradation study was carried out for 4 weeks; however, no significant
differences were determined with an unpaired t-test
(p > 0.05) (Figures S3 and S4).

Silver Release from Composite Cements
A release study
of silver ions was performed in deionized water for a period of 21
days, and the cumulative release profiles are presented in Figure 7. The bone cements
loaded with AgNWs continuously released Ag+ ions to the
surrounding water with the amount of silver increasing significantly
within the first day and then reaching a plateau. No statistical difference
was found between the different cements studied (p > 0.05), even though the cements containing CS/CSMCC presented
a
higher Ag+ release at any time point.

silver ions from bone cements: PMMA_AgNWs_1

Data are reported as a mean ± SD (n = 3). One-way
ANOVA, at 21 days, returned p > 0.05.

Antibacterial Properties of Cements
The antimicrobial
properties of the composite bone cements were determined using an
MTT assay after 24 h of incubation in an S. aureus suspension. PMMA-only cements presented lower bacterial attachment
than the cements containing CS or CSMCC powders at concentrations
higher or equal to 20% (Figure 8). On the other hand, when AgNWs were incorporated within
the formulation, they induced a significant reduction of the viable
bacteria attached to the cement for all of the studied formulations
(p < 0.05), except for CS and CSMCC at 10%.

Evaluation of the Cytocompatibility
of the Composite Cements
Cytocompatibility was evaluated
both on cement eluates (Figure 9A,B) and directly
on composite PMMA cements (Figure 9C,D). The use of eluates simulates the postsurgical
release of toxic leachables into the surrounding bony environment.
Moreover, through serial dilutions, it is possible to evaluate the
dose-dependent effect. Cytocompatibility was assessed after 24 and
48 h of incubation of cells with the eluates, and no statistical difference
was found (p > 0.05), except for PMMA_AgNWs_1
(p < 0.01). The cell viability at 24 h was >
80% for all
cements with P/L 2:1; except for the cements containing 20% of CS
or CSMCC and AgNWs that caused a significant decrease in cell viability:
PMMA_CS20%_AgNWs_1 (51.6 ± 31.5%), PMMA_CSMCC20%_AgNWs_1 (55.6
± 36.6%), PMMA_CS20%_AgNWs_0.8 (52.4 ± 9.3%), and PMMA_CSMCC20%_AgNWs_0.8
(45.2 ± 30.9%). Diluted extracts (50%) always maintained cell
viability > 80%, indicating a dose-dependent effect (Figure S5). When comparing the two different
concentrations
of MMA at different time points, no statistical difference was found
(p > 0.05). Overall, these results suggest that
with
the addition of CS/CSMCC (and consequently the reduction of bone cement
powder) in the formulation, less liquid cement could react with the
initiator and more toxic leachables were released from the cements
over time.

to compare each formulation with or without AgNWs. ATP assay for MSCs
after 1 day and 3 days of incubation on CS cements (C) and CSMCC cements
(D). One-way ANOVA was carried out to compare ATP levels of each cement
to PMMA 2:1 at days 1 and 3 and showed a statistical difference (p < 0.05). Results of Dunnett’s multicomparison
are reported in the graph; in particular, $p < 0.05, $$p < 0.01, $$$p < 0.001, and $$$$p < 0.0001, at day 1. £p <

was performed to compare each type of cement at 1 and 3 days (*p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0005).

Cell proliferation at 1 and 3 days of seeding cells
onto the cement
surface was also evaluated. It was found that there was significantly
higher cell proliferation between days 1 and 3 for cells seeded on
samples containing PMMA-only both with (p < 0.05)
and without AgNWs (p < 0.0001). While for samples
containing CS/CSMCC in low amounts, only the following samples showed
increased proliferation: PMMA_CS10% (p < 0.0001),
PMMA_CS10%_AgNWs (p < 0.05), PMMA_CSMCC10% (p < 0.05), and PMMA_CS20% (p < 0.05).
For higher concentrations of polysaccharide, proliferation did not
statistically increase (p > 0.05). These results
are similar to those reported by Tan et al. who loaded PMMA-based
cements with chitosan powder at 20% w/w (PMMA-C).28 Compared with PMMA, PMMA-C cements presented a lower proliferation
rate. These results are also in agreement with the cytotoxicity studies
performed on the extracts; the increased ratio between the bone cement
liquid and bone cement powder decreased cell viability, over time.

On the other hand, the inclusion of AgNWs did not interfere with
cell proliferation in comparison to their controls.

Discussion
Carefully designing composite biomaterials is paramount in overcoming
limitations of currently used products such as PMMA. In the present
study, a number of strategies have been combined to address the main
limitations affecting the performance of PMMA cements. The strategies
included 1. the addition of biodegradable chitosan to increase material
porosity and degradability, thus favoring PMMA/bone integration and
tuning the mechanical properties of the material; 2. the use of methacrylated
chitosan to reduce polymerization temperature and avoid the risk of
tissue necrosis; and 3. the addition of AgNWs to bestow antibacterial
properties.

Methacryloyl chitosan (CSMCC) was successfully obtained
with a
degree of substitution of 25% and used in the formulation of composite
cements. Before addition to the composite cements, both the chitosan
and modified chitosan were tested to evaluate their antimicrobial
properties in the solid form. The antibacterial activity observed
for all chitosan powders studied was lower than that reported in the
literature. This was expected, as the powders were in suspension at
a neutral pH, while published studies have been carried out at a pH
lower than the pKa of chitosan.29 In an acidic environment, chitosan is protonated
and thus capable of interacting with the negatively charged bacterial
surface.16 These results confirm the need
to add, to composite PMMA cements, other components with antimicrobial
properties beside chitosan, to obtain an effective action against
possible bacterial infections. Once established that CS and CSMCC
on their own were not able to provide benefits in terms of the antimicrobial
activity, we evaluated their effect on the temperature and time of
polymerization. According to ISO 5833:2002, the maximum polymerization
temperature for acrylic resin cements should be ≤90 °C;
temperatures lower than 56 °C would ensure reduced tissue necrosis
at the interface between the cement and the natural tissue. Our study
showed that the addition of CS and CSMCC reduced the peak polymerization
temperature by heat dissipation throughout the bone cement material
as previously shown for other additives, such as MgO, hydroxyapatite,
CS, BaSO4, and SiO2.30 The addition of the polysaccharide also increased the setting time
but within acceptable limits. This experiment revealed that the modification
of chitosan to CSMCC did not afford any advantage in terms of significantly
reduced polymerization temperature; the simple addition of chitosan
was sufficient to achieve this goal. Similarly, the use of CSMCC did
not affect water absorption and degradation of the composite cements.
However, the use of the polysaccharides allowed us to obtain cements
with tunable degradation properties. Similarly, it was expected that
chitosan would help modulate the mechanical properties of the composite
cements. This would help overcome one of the major problems related
to standard PMMA cements that is the mismatch between the mechanical
properties of the cement and the bone, especially in the case of osteoporotic
bone,31 with a consequently increased risk
of fracture of the adjacent vertebral bodies, in cases of vertebral
augmentation with PMMA.32 It has been previously
shown that the mechanical properties of PMMA-based bone cements can
be decreased by introducing porosity or using additives.26,33 The addition of CS and CSMCC resulted in reduced compressive strength
and Young’s modulus once the concentration of the additive
reached 20% w/w. This can be due to a combination of increased porosity
and incomplete monomer polymerization caused by the presence of the
polysaccharide in the setting mixture and in correlation with the
observed reduced polymerization temperature. One of the aims of the
study was also to create cements that would inhibit the formation
of a biofilm in vivo. The lack of antibacterial activity of chitosan
powders loaded into PMMA cements was expected as already highlighted
by Dunne et al.; this behavior may be due to the physical form of
CS or CSMCC powders that act as physical supports for the attachment
of bacteria, as previously reported for chitosan microspheres, powders,
and flakes.16,34 For this reason, AgNWs were added
as the antimicrobial agent. We previously demonstrated that AgNWs
are able to provide a sustained release of silver ions on their own;14 current data support this; in fact, all composite
cements released Ag+ with a similar profile with the total
cumulative release well below the potential toxic limit of 10 ppm
for human cells.35 Our findings show that
AgNWs can reduce biofilm formation on bone cements; these results
are in good agreement with those reported by Prokopovich et al. who
showed a significant reduction of bacterial attachment on PMMA cements
loaded with 0.05% silver nanospheres (5.3 ± 2.3 nm).11 Chitosan and AgNW combinations in the PMMA cements,
similarly to our previous study on composite hydrogels, show that
the activity of AgNWs is potentiated by the presence of chitosan due
to a synergic activity.14 The same combination
provides good cell viability when the concentration of chitosan is
lower than 20% w/w.

Conclusions
CS and CSMCC were added
to PMMA cements in concentrations ranging
from 10 to 30% w/w. The reduction of the polymerization temperature
was found to be dose-dependent and significantly reduced for concentrations
> 10%. An increased water uptake and weight loss were observed
in
cements containing chitosan or modified chitosan in comparison to
the controls, and the effect was more noticeable with an increase
in their concentration. The compressive strength and elastic modulus
generally decreased with an increasing mass ratio of CS or CSMCC in
the mixture; the same trend was observed for cytotoxicity. No statistical
differences were observed between the materials containing either
CS or CSMCC. The results of the in vitro studies demonstrated that
the incorporation of AgNWs in PMMA–chitosan cements in a concentration
of 1% w/w can be a viable approach to prevent S. aureus infections on the scaffold, while not affecting their mechanical
properties and cytocompatibility. These formulations provided a sustained
release of Ag+ ions, suggesting potential antimicrobial
activity over an extended period of time. Overall, this study suggests
that the inclusion of CS/CSMCC (between 10 and 20%) and AgNWs (1%)
in the existing commercial materials can provide bone cements with
good cytocompatibility and appropriate thermal, mechanical, and antibacterial
properties.
