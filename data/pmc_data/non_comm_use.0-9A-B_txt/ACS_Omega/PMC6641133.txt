Harmful
UVC (200–280 nm) radiation is entirely screened
by a combination of dioxygen and ozone in the stratosphere. However,
because of environmental pollution, depletion of stratospheric ozone
layer is increasing alarmingly, ensuing danger of penetration of the
harmful UVC through the earth’s atmosphere to reach the living
world. Studies have shown that UVC radiation accelerates aging of
albumin solutions along with other qualitative changes. Herein, we
have used in situ grown and ex situ added gold nanoclusters (AuNCs)
to minimize the damage in the protein structure caused by long-term
UVC exposure. The effects were demonstrated in the absence and presence
of lipid vesicles to mimic the biological environment. Bovine serum
albumin (BSA) has been used as the model protein that contains ∼50–60%
helicity. It is observed that UVC converts most of α-helix into
β-sheet, leading to the aggregation of protein. The ingrown
AuNCs could provide about 23–40% protection to the secondary
structure, whereas the externally added AuNCs preserved almost 73–82%.
To generalize this finding, we have also studied the effect of AuNC
protection on the UVC-exposed lysozyme protein. The results show that
the proposed method is indeed helpful for life.

1 Introduction
The minute concentration
of ozone in the ozone layer of the stratosphere
is extremely important to the living world because it absorbs biologically
harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation coming from the Sun. UV radiation
can principally be divided into three categories based on wavelengths:
UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (280–320 nm), and UVC (200–280
nm). The most harmful UVC and the moderate UVB are almost entirely
blocked by the ozone layer. The less harmful UVA reaches the earth’s
crust. However, increase in environmental pollution leads to the depletion
of the ozone layer resulting in percolation of UVC. Recently, Michnik
et al. have shown that UVC exposure may induce accelerated aging of
albumin protein.1 Even, UVC-treated plants
show adverse effects on shoot growth, leaf number, protein and carbohydrate
contents in leaf as well as chlorophyll a and b, and total carotenoid contents.2 In a study on γD-crystallin protein, present in human eye
lens, Wang and Wen reported profuse aggregation of the protein upon
prolonged exposure to UVC.3 Reports state
that UVC can potentially damage proteins through photolysis-generating
reactive species, resulting in protein thiol oxidation.4 Moreover, Seker et al. exposed the alarming effect
of UVC induced DNA damage that leads to p53-dependent nuclear trafficking
of a promyelocytic leukemia protein, which is a nuclear phosphoprotein
that localizes to distinct domains in the nucleus.5

Some remedial measures to the adverse effects of
UVC exposure have
been proposed. It is reported that treatment with 5-fluorouracil enhances
the stability of bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein by 2-fold under
UVC irradiation.6 Shih and Cherng showed
that treatment by a Chlorella-derived
peptide resists UVC-induced cytotoxicity through the inhibition of
caspase-3 activity and reduction of phosphorylated Fas-associated
protein with death domain (FADD) and cleaved polymerase-1 expression.7 Progressing with the recent trend in nanomaterials
research, herein, we present the remedial effect of gold nanoclusters
(AuNCs) to the adversity of UVC exposure that induces protein damage.
There is hardly any report on this aspect, and we believe that the
simplicity in the application of the present method will attract studies
in the pharmaceutical field. BSA protein has been used as a model
in this study, and AuNCs were either grown in situ or added externally
to compare the extent of protein damage by UVC exposure. Experiments
on the irradiation effect were also performed in presence of lipid
vesicles where the model protein is trapped at the liposomal interface
to mimic cell membrane. The results are encouraging as the protein
could be protected up to ∼70%. The consequences were generalized
through studies on the lysozyme (Lys) protein in which similar results
were obtained.

2 Results and Discussion
BSA-coated near-infrared (NIR)-emitting AuNCs (NC1) and l-glutathione (GSH)-coated AuNCs (NC2) were synthesized for the in
situ and the ex situ studies, respectively. NC1 and NC2-treated BSA
(NC2@BSA) were separately embedded in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DMPG) vesicles for the liposomal studies.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments (Figure 1) show the hydrodynamic diameters for BSA
= 6.6 nm, NC1 = 8.8 nm, NC2 = 2.7 nm, and NC2@BSA = 9.3 nm. The data
show that the AuNC produced in BSA (NC1) is 2.2 nm in diameter. The
sizes correlate well with the obtained emission spectra.8,9

Figure 1 DLS
histograms of (from left to right) (upper panel) BSA (6.6 nm)
and NC1 (8.8 nm) and (lower panel) NC2 (2.7 nm) and NC2@BSA (9.3 nm).

The AuNCs were characterized by
their absorption and fluorescence
spectra (Figure 2).
The 280 nm band in each of the absorption spectra is due to BSA. NC1
shows two peaks at 435 and 650 nm in its emission spectrum (Figure 2a). NC2 shows its
emission maximum at 650 nm (Figure 2b) that shifts to 626 nm in NC2@BSA because of its
encapsulation in the less polar protein environment (Figure 2c). The long-wavelength bands
are due to the AuNCs. The blue emission is due to the oxidative states
of BSA in the presence of HAuCl4.10

Figure 2 Absorption
(black) and emission (red, ex = 280 nm and blue, ex
= 370 nm) spectra of (a) NC1, (b) NC2, and (c) NC2@BSA in the aqueous
medium at room temperature and neutral pH.

Prolonged exposure of BSA to UVC (up to 3 h) shows the appearance
and enhancement of a distinct absorption band at 318 nm in aqueous
medium in addition to the band at 278 nm (Figure 3a). Increase in 280 nm absorption band indicates
structural changes induced in BSA and that in 318 nm band shows aggregation
of the protein.1,11,12 We have also intercalated the protein in DMPG vesicle to biomimic
the system and performed the same set of experiments as mentioned
above, where changes were found to be similar (Figure 3b). Emission from the embedded tryptophan
in BSA concomitantly decreases along with a consistent bathochromic
shift upon exposure to UVC (Figure 3c,d). As the fluorescence yield of tryptophan is much
lower in bulk water compared with that while embedded in BSA, progressive
quenching of emission from BSA with UVC exposure indicates a change
in conformation of the protein resulting in exposition of tryptophan
toward the bulk environment.13,14 The bathochromic shift
shows that polarity around the fluorophore increases as time progresses.

Figure 3 Absorption
spectral changes in (a) BSA and (b) BSA trapped in DMPG
vesicles upon exposure to UVC radiation for around 3 h in the aqueous
medium. The emission spectral changes are shown in (c) and (d) for
BSA and BSA trapped in DMPG, respectively, upon excitation at 280
nm.

Far-UV circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy provides quantitative
information on the secondary structure. The CD spectra of BSA and
BSA-incorporated DMPG vesicles indicate a change in the secondary
structure of BSA (Figure 4). Initially, the CD spectrum of BSA gave a large value of
molar ellipticity at 222 and 208 nm, indicating ∼52% α-helix
content in the BSA structure and presence of ∼13% β-sheet.15,16 Upon exposure to UVC for about 3 h, we found a decrease in the α-helix
content in BSA both under free and intercalated conditions to ∼1.72%
along with an augmentation of β-sheet to ∼29%. Such circumstances
are known in other modes of denaturation of BSA protein as well. Holm
et al. showed that BSA aggregation takes place at an elevated temperature
where the thermal aggregates have amyloid properties.17 Fibrillation, which occurs over minutes to hours, does
not have a lag phase and is independent of seeding.

Figure 4 CD spectra of BSA and
BSA-intercalated DMPG vesicles under different
conditions. The UVC exposure time is about 3 h.

While admiring the previous reports on the effect of UVC
on proteins1−5 and the remedies to lower the adverse effect of the radiation,6,7 we propose a simpler AuNC-based model that can be applied to reduce
the unwanted curse of UVC exposure due to environmental pollution
considerably. Hence,
we have synthesized the in situ and ex situ variants of BSA-protected
AuNCs and mimicked the biological cells by intercalating them at the
DMPG interface. AuNC generation in situ (NC1) changes the secondary
structural motif of BSA, where we recorded the percentages of α-helix
and β-sheet to be 41.43 and 3.2, respectively. This is in accordance
with the previous reports.18,19 Absorption of the ex
situ generated GSH-protected AuNCs (NC2) inside of BSA, which can
be achieved by incubating the aqueous solution of NC2 with BSA for
6 h, marginally changes the α-helix and β-sheet percentages
to ∼50 and ∼11, respectively, compared to the parent
BSA. Comparing the status of NC1 and NC2@BSA, it becomes apparent
that the latter could be a better candidate because the change in
the secondary structure of BSA is much less.

The absorption
spectra of NC1 and NC2 show an augmentation of a
shoulder peak at ∼320 nm as before, but the extent of increase
is remarkably low (Figure 5). The relative absorbance plots of the AuNC-based species
show that the secondary structure destruction of BSA is reduced by
40 times (Figure 6a).
Comparing the activities of NC1 and NC2 and their liposome-intercalated
counterparts, it is obvious that the action of NC2@BSA in a DMPG vesicle
is most superior in the group (Figure 6b). This is encouraging in the sense that NC2 is added
externally to BSA and the absorbed composite is intercalated in a
DMPG vesicle to provide a suitable mimic to the mechanism in the biological
cellular environment. Hence, it is apparent that the application of
ex situ NC2 would minimize the adverse effect of UVC radiation on
a biological cellular protein.

and (b) BSA trapped in DMPG vesicles and GSH-protected AuNC added

Excitation of native BSA at 280 nm yields emission
maximum at 340
nm (Figure 3c). The
DMPG-vesicle-intercalated BSA emits at 330 nm (Figure 3d). This provides evidence about the existence
of BSA in much lesser polarity inside of the liposomes. We observed
that NC1 shows multiple emission bands at 345, 400, and 665 nm (Figure 7a). The 345 nm emission
is that of BSA in which a 5 nm bathochromic shift indicates a higher
micropolarity due to openness in the protein structure. It is known
that while synthesizing AuNC inside of BSA, the protein not only acts
as a reducing agent but also develops oxidative states of BSA.11 The 400 nm band is thus attributed to the oxidative
states of BSA, and the 665 nm band denotes emission from the AuNCs.
The oxides of BSA are generated by HAuCl4 during the synthesis
process while developing the AuNCs in situ.11 Production of the GSH-protected AuNCs (NC2) uses HAuCl4 ex situ and thus does not produce the oxidative states in BSA as
mentioned above. This is clearly reflected in the emission spectrum
of NC2@BSA, where we find two emission bands at 340 and 665 nm for
BSA and the AuNCs, respectively (Figure 7b). Fluorescence spectral changes in the
liposome-intercalated AuNC variants are also similar. The relative
decrease in BSA emission is found to be the highest for the unprotected
BSA and the lowest for NC2 in BSA intercalated in a DMPG liposome
(Figure 8). Simultaneously,
the 665 nm band of AuNCs also suffers a decrease in fluorescence because
of the change in microenvironment.

systems. All data
are within 5% error limit.

We did far-UV CD spectroscopy with the AuNC samples to compare
and provide an idea about the quantitative structural changes in BSA
upon exposure to UVC for a prolonged period of time (Figure 9). The change in ellipticity
at 222 and 208 nm indicates α-helix percentage that decreases
from 41.43 to 11.38 and 16.84 for bare NC1 and in liposomes, respectively
(Figure 9a). Encouragingly,
we observed that the decrease in α-helix percentage is from
49.88 to 38.40 and 38.85 for bare NC2@BSA and in liposomes after UVC
exposure, respectively (Figure 9b). The β-sheet populations in the above cases are 25.97,
22.46, 14.93, and 14.64. These figures are far better in comparison
with those obtained from the action of UVC on BSA (vide supra). NC2@BSA
intercalated in DMPG vesicles provides maximum resistance to the adverse
effects of UVC.

with
time. All data are within 5% error limit.

The results were generalized by studying the effect of prolonged
exposure of UVC on Lys. We synthesized AuNCs in Lys and GSH-protected
AuNCs and modified with Lys. Similar characterization of the Lys–AuNC
composites was performed by DLS. The experiment shows that the hydrodynamic
diameter of Lys is 4.8 nm,20,21 the size of AuNC@Lys
is 7.3 nm, and the size of Lys + AuNC@GSH is 7.5 nm. Hence, the size
of AuNCs produced in Lys is 1.5 nm. The AuNCs in Lys were characterized
by their absorption and fluorescence spectra (Figure 10). The 280 nm band in each of the absorption
spectra is due to Lys. AuNC@Lys shows two peaks at 445 and 650 nm
in its emission spectrum (Figure 10a), and the GSH-protected AuNC in Lys shows its emission
band at 616 nm (Figure 10b). The long-wavelength bands are due to the AuNCs. The blue
emission is due to the oxidative states of Lys in the presence of
HAuCl4.

Figure 10 Absorption (black) and emission (red, ex = 280 nm and
blue, ex
= 370 nm) spectra of (a) AuNC@Lys and (b) GSH-protected AuNC@Lys in
the aqueous medium.

Prolonged exposure of
Lys and Lys trapped in DMPG to UVC shows
structural changes similar to those observed in the case of BSA as
evidenced from the spectroscopic data (Figure 11). Far-UV CD spectra of Lys and Lys-incorporated
DMPG vesicles indicate a change in the secondary structure of Lys
(Figure 12). The α-
and β-helix contents in Lys are calculated to be 32.16 and 15.09%,
respectively.22−24 Upon exposure to UVC for about 3 h, the α-helix
content in free Lys reduced to 23.50% and the β-sheet content
increased to 21.70%.

Figure 11 Absorption spectral changes in (a) Lys and (b) Lys trapped
in DMPG
vesicles upon exposure to UVC radiation for around 3 h in the aqueous
medium. The emission spectral changes are shown in (c) and (d) for
Lys and Lys trapped in DMPG, respectively, upon excitation at 280
nm.

Figure 12 CD spectra of BSA and BSA-intercalated
DMPG vesicles under different
conditions. The UVC exposure time is about 3 h.

Similar to BSA, we observe that the change in the absorbance
at
322 nm for Lys, which develops due to protein aggregation, drops remarkably
on application of AuNCs (Figure 13). This effect seems to be identical on the ex situ
addition of AuNCs to the DMPG-trapped Lys. However, the relative changes
in the emission indicate that the ex situ application of GSH-protected
AuNCs to Lys in DMPG vesicles is more effective than the in situ production
of the NC. Far-UV CD spectroscopy shows a similar behavior for Lys
as seen in the case of BSA (Table 1) (see Figure 14).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have proposed a simple and ready remedy to the adverse
effects of UVC exposure on a model protein, BSA. Percolation of UVC
radiation through the stratosphere is probable because of the depletion
of the protective ozone layer because of the environmental pollution.
In the present report, we have shown that AuNCs can serve as measures
to considerably reduce protein aggregation due to UVC radiation. The
effect of UVC on bare BSA results in considerable changes in the secondary
structure, leading to aggregation. The spectroscopic results show
that the in situ grown AuNCs in BSA reduce changes in the protein
structure, which, in turn, is enhanced when the AuNCs are produced
ex situ and applied to protein. Moreover, intercalation of the AuNC-absorbed
BSA in a liposomal bilayer serves best in this context. These results
were confirmed by the application of AuNCs to Lys protein as well
under identical exposure to UVC radiation.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Gold(III) chloride hydrate,
BSA (lyophilized powder, ≥98%), Lys from chicken egg white
(lyophilized powder, ≥90%), DMPG, and GSH reduced (≥98%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide pellets were obtained
from Merck. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) water was
used in all experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of AuNC@BSA (NC1)
The BSA-coated
NIR-emitting AuNCs were prepared as described elsewhere.25 Briefly, an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (5 mL, 10 mM, 37 °C) was mixed with a BSA solution (5 mL, 50
mg mL–1, 37 °C) under vigorous stirring. After
5 min, 0.5 mL of NaOH solution (1.2 M) was added, and the reaction
was allowed to continue at 37 °C for 12 h. An intense red-colored
solution was obtained and stored at 4 °C.

4.3 Synthesis
of GSH-Protected AuNC (NC2) and
BSA Modification
The GSH-coated AuNC was synthesized by following
a previous protocol.26,27 Briefly, freshly prepared aqueous
solution of HAuCl4 (20 mM, 0.5 mL) and l-GSH (100
mM, 0.15 mL) was mixed with 4.35 mL of deionized water of HPLC grade
at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was heated to 70 °C under
gentle stirring for 24 h. A yellow-colored aqueous solution was obtained.
The aqueous solution of GSH-protected AuNC (NC2) could be stored at
4 °C for 6 months with negligible changes in the photophysical
properties. NC2 was modified with the BSA protein by incubating the
aqueous solution of NC with BSA (50 mg mL–1) for
6 h. The modification was monitored by the emission spectrum of the
NC.

4.4 Preparation of NC1 and NC2@BSA Intercalated
in DMPG Vesicles
The two NCs were embedded in DMPG lipid
vesicles as reported earlier.28 DMPG was
dissolved in a chloroform/methanol mixture in a 2:1 ratio, which was
then evaporated using a rotary evaporator. A thin lipid film was produced,
which was kept overnight in vacuum for further drying. Tris buffer
(pH 7.4) along with the aliquots of NC1 at a temperature above the
phase-transition temperature (24 °C) of DMPG was added to the
dry lipid film to achieve a final lipid concentration of 4 mM. The
suspensions were then homogenized by vortexing followed by heating/cooling
in five cycles. In a single cycle, the samples were kept at 30 °C
for 10 min and at 4 °C for further 10 min. For spectroscopic
measurements, the samples were diluted 10 times in deionized water
to stop light scattering. A similar procedure was followed for NC2@BSA.

4.5 Synthesis of AuNC@Lys
The Lys-coated
AuNC was synthesized by following the same protocol as used for the
preparation of BSA-coated AuNCs with a slight modification. Briefly,
an aqueous solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (2 mL,
10 mM, 37 °C) was added to Lys solution (50 mg mL–1) under vigorous stirring. About 0.2 mL of NaOH (1 M) was added to
adjust the acidity of the solution at pH 12, and the reaction was
continued at 37 °C for 8 h. The color of the solution turned
from light yellow to deep brown, indicating the formation of Lys-coated
AuNCs. It was stored at 4 °C.

Synthesis of GSH-coated AuNC,
Lys modification, and intercalation in DMPG vesicles were performed
similar to that for the BSA protein.

4.6 Instrumentation
The absorption spectra
were collected using a U-2900 spectrometer from Hitachi, and the emission
spectral studies were performed in a QM-40 spectrofluorometer from
PTI. The particle size of NCs was measured by DLS using a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano equipped with a 4 mW HeNe laser operated at λ
= 633 nm. All measurements were recorded at room temperature with
a scattering angle of 173°. Size distribution calculated using
Nano software was derived from non-negative least-square analysis.
The samples were almost 10 times more diluted than those used in the
spectroscopic measurements. Hence, the concentration used for the
DLS experiment was 10 μM. The samples were kept in a UV chamber
under 254 nm radiation with an 8 W lamp placed 5 cm away from the
samples for 3 h of UVC exposure.

4.7 Calculation
of UVC Dose
Energy, E = hc/λ, where h is Planck’s constant =
6.626 × 10–34 m2 kg/s, c is the velocity of light
= 3 × 108 m/s, and λ is the wavelength of radiation
= 254 nm = 2.54 × 10–7 m. Hence,  or E = 7.8260 × 10–19 J. The duration of irradiation is 3 h or 10 800
s. Hence, E = 7.8260 × 10–19 × 10 800 = 8.4521 × 10–15 J is
falling on a meter square. The source is 5 cm away. Hence, consideration
of squared law as the source is 5 cm or 0.05 m away, which means the
radiation only covers (0.05)2 = 0.0025 m2. This
means that the energy has to be divided by 1/0.0025 = 400 so as to
make it in 1 m2. Hence, E = 8.5421 ×
10–15/400 = 2.1130 × 10–17 J is the UVC dose at 254 nm.
