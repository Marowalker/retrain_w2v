We investigate selected chemical,
technical, and economic aspects
of the production of fish oil rich in polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty
acids from anchovy filleting leftovers using d-limonene
as the extraction solvent at ambient temperature and pressure. Entirely
derived from the orange peel prior to orange squeezing for juice production,
the bio-based solvent is easily recovered, affording a circular economy
process with significant potential for practical applications.

1 Introduction
Omega-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs) provide numerous health
benefits.1 In brief, the ability of tissue’s
self-defense against oxidative stress depends upon its ω-6:ω-3
lipid composition.2 In 1971 Bang, Dyerberg,
and Nielsen reported surprisingly low plasma cholesterol, triglycerides,
and β-lipoprotein concentration in blood samples from 61 male
and 69 female Inuit living in Greenland.3 Even though in agreement with the fact that heart disease accounted
for only 5.3 per cent of deaths amongst Greenland males, aged 45 to
64 (a much lower figure compared to counterpart males eating then
typical and vastly different diet), the results were most surprising
because the dietary habits of the Inuit population studied, mostly
eating fish, seal, and whale meat and their oil, were “very
like those of the carnivorous animals”.3 In 1975, the same team reported the discovery in the same Inuit
plasma lipids of two fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3).4 Fish, whale, seal, and cod liver
oils, indeed, are all rich in both EPA and DHA PUFAs.

Today
omega-3 nutrients, mostly of marine origin, are widely consumed
across the World as dietary supplements (52.9% of global value share
in 2017)5 and as valued ingredients for
infant formula (20.2% of the value share) and pharmaceuticals (15.4%).

As recently noted by Winkler,6 less
than 20% of world’s population eats as much as 250 mg/day of
seafood omega-3, and because the lowest target for EPA and DHA intake
is 250 mg/day, it follows that “more than 80% of the World
is failing to meet even the lowest recommended intake.”6 Accordingly, the omega-3 index reflecting the
omega-3 status in the body, namely the total concentration of EPA
and DHA in red blood cells expressed as a percentage of total fatty
acid content (a biomarker for fatty acid composition, correlating
with tissue fatty acid composition, measured in erythrocytes of low
biologic variability),7 “in many
parts of the world, including in Asia Pacific, remains much lower
than optimal”.8

The use of
fishery byproducts, (discards in the marine fisheries
and leftovers in fish processing companies available worldwide in
several million tonnes per year amount),9 as raw materials for the production of fish oil omega-3 extracts
is highly desirable.10 Anchovies, for example,
are amid world’s largest fish catches which has led several
governments to establish quotas to limit overfishing. Out of 1.2 million
of tonnes of fish caught in the Mediterranean and in the Black Sea,
small pelagics sardines and anchovies account for one-third of all
catches.11

Mostly used to produce
animal feed and fish oil, anchovies are
also processed to produce valued and expensive fillets. One method
recently introduced to obtain valued anchovy oil from anchovy filleting
leftovers relies on d-limonene as the green biosolvent.12 Limonene indeed is a renewable solvent present
as the main component of orange oil obtained from waste orange peel.13 In the following, we investigate selected chemical,
technical, and economic aspects of the production of fish oil rich
in polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids from anchovy filleting waste
using (+)-limonene at ambient temperature and pressure as the unique
extraction solvent.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Limonene Versus Hexane for Anchovy Oil Extraction
Orange-derived d-limonene has been used and applied
successfully for decades in the food, cosmetic, and personal care
product industries for its flavor and fragrance qualities added to
its physical and chemical properties.14 Its more recent use as an extraction solvent of lipids offers several
technical, environmental, and health advantages over the use of n-hexane.14,15 Besides excellent yields, for
example, in extraction of rice bran oil compared to extraction with
conventional n-hexane,16 the amount of the oxidation products in the recovered limonene is
<1 wt % of the original biosolvent.

Computational comparison
of the solvation power of d-limonene and n-hexane for salmon fish oil using both the conductor-like
screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) and the Hansen solubility
parameter (HSP) models to evaluate the solubility of selected components
of salmon oil in n-hexane and d-limonene
shows that d-limonene is a better solvent than hexane
for all triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, free fatty acids, and ergosterol
studied.17

The former model relies
on quantum calculation software combining
quantum chemical (COSMO) and statistical thermodynamics (RS). The
HSP computational model, in its turn, is based on the relative energy
difference number (RED) to determine whether the alternative solvent
and the solute are miscible (eq 1) 1  where Rb is the
radius of a Hansen solubility sphere and Ra is the distance of a solvent molecule located inside the Hansen
solubility sphere.17 A potentially good
solvent has a RED number <1 (while an unsuitable solvent has RED
>1) because, reflecting to the “like dissolves the like”
empirical rule, the smaller Ra, the higher
is the affinity between the solute and the solvent. Calculations were
performed using the HSPiP 4.0 software (Hansen-solubility, Denmark).

Similarly, the COSMO calculations were performed for each molecule
of interest. In said calculations, the molecules are considered in
a virtual conductor environment. A solute molecule induces a polarization
charge density at the interface between the molecule and the conductor
on the molecular surface. The 3D polarization density distribution
on the surface of each molecule is converted into the σ-profile,
namely, a distribution function displaying the relative amount of
surface with polarity σ on the surface of the molecule. In said σ-profile,
blue represents strongly positive polar regions and red represents
highly negative polar surfaces, whereas green and yellow are used
to identify regions of lower polarity.16

In general, even though the overall number of fatty acids
in fish
oil can approach 100 (leading, e.g., to 250 different triacylglycerols
in menhaden oil),18 the lipid profile of
fish oils is primarily described by reference to two polyunsaturated
(20:5(n-3), 22:6(n-3)), four monounsaturated
(16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1), and two saturated (14:0, 16:0) fatty acids.19 Anchovy oil makes no exception, with palmitic
acid (16:0) being the major SFA; oleic acid (18:1) being the most
abundant monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA); and DHA, EPA, and α-linolenic
acid being the most abundant PUFAs.20

Derived from the combination of three free fatty acids (C18:1,
C18:2, and C16:0) beyond EPA and DHA, the chemical structures simulated
include four triacylglycerols [TAG 1 (C18:1, C18:1, C18:1), TAG 2
(C18:1, C18:1, C18:2), TAG 3 (C16:0, C18:1, C18:1), and TAG 4 (C16:0,
C18:1, C18:2)] and four diacylglycerols [DAG 1 (C18:1, C18:1), DAG
2 (C18:1, C18:2), DAG 3 (C18:2, C18:2), and DAG 4 (C18:1, C16:0)].
The solubility and structures of three free fatty acids (FFA1, C18:1),
(FFA2, C18:2), and (FFA3, C16:0) and ergosterol were simulated, too.

The TAGs selected, in the equivalent carbon number (ECN) 46–48
range, are amongst the most representative in anchovy oil.21 We briefly remind that hydrophobicity of TAG
lipids is determined by the ECN (=total carbon atom number –
2 × number of double bonds). Phospholipids that represent about
the 30% of total lipids in the fresh anchovies are not included in
the simulation because their proportion in total lipid quickly decreases
during storage of anchovy because of their rapid hydrolysis at temperatures
above −29 °C.22

The chemical
structure of TAG 1 (OOO, with oleic acid bound to
all residues of the glycerol molecule) simulated in Figure 1, and the results of computation
show that according both to HSP and COSMO-RS models, d-limonene is a better solvent for extraction of all the compounds
studied.

and n-hexane σ-surface; (b) oleic acid triglyceride
(TAG 1) σ-surface; (c) energies of local surface interactions

of TAG 1 and solvents.

2.2 Further Advantages
The use of limonene
at room temperature as an anchovy leftover extraction solvent offers
numerous additional advantages. Conventional extraction of salmon
oil from lyophilized samples of salmon under reflux during 8 h in
a Soxhlet apparatus takes place at the high boiling point around 180
°C of the terpene, followed by addition of 50% (v/v) water to
the biosolvent and evaporation under reduced pressure.17 Regardless of the excellent solvation power
predicted by computation, in practice, extraction under reflux of
the aforementioned fish oil results in oil containing low TAG and
high DAG amounts17 because of rapid oxidation
of PUFAs at temperatures above 100 °C.23

Mild extraction of anchovy fillet leftovers with d-limonene at ambient temperature and pressure, on the other hand,
reproducibly affords an orange oil rich in PUFAs. In detail, the anchovy
oil from the leftovers of European anchovies caught in Sicily in early
July contains EPA (5.4%), DHA (12.38%), and α-linolenic acid
(0.96%), the most abundant omega-3 PUFAs, with palmitic acid (33.55%)
being the major SFA and oleic acid (23.97%) being the most abundant
MUFA.12

The presence of limonene
traces in the residual anchovy fillet
discards upon lipid extraction, likely to find use as an animal feed,
is beneficial. In 2015, indeed, scholars in Algeria discovered that
orange, lemon, and bergamot essential oils are highly effective in
combating the growth of pathogenic bacteria causing most common fish
food poisoning and recommended their use “as potent natural
preservatives to contribute to the reduction of lipid oxidation in
sardines”.24 Limonene, furthermore,
is both bactericidal and bacteriostatic for several Gram-negative
and Gram-positive fish pathogenic bacteria, which led another scholar
based in Algeria to recommend its use as an alternative to antibiotics
to prevent fish bacterial infections in aquaculture.25

One more problem solved by limonene-based extraction
of anchovy
leftovers is the significant odor of the dead anchovy fish residues.
Such unpleasant odor is also due to the oxidation products formed
by rapid oxidation at ambient conditions of free PUFAs, which are
formed upon rapid hydrolysis of phospholipids contained in the cell
membranes and which in fresh anchovy account for about 30% of total
lipid.26 Stirring the milled leftovers
in d-limonene at an extraction unit located within
the anchovy processing plant would remove the triglycerides and the
free PUFAs from the adipose tissues, inhibiting their oxidation, thanks
to the antioxidant power of the terpene.

Finally, with its exquisite
smell, d-limonene
used to treat the anchovy leftovers would eliminate bad odor throughout
the fishery plant and the associated health and worker well-being
issues.

2.3 Economic Aspects
Extraction of fish
oil with d-limonene from anchovy leftovers transforms
a voice of cost into a revenue voice. Currently, for instance, anchovy
fillet processing company in Sicily (Italy) pays waste-processing
companies around $282(€250)/t to dispose of discards as biowaste
which can no longer be landfilled.27

Displayed in Scheme 1, the process lately developed on the laboratory scale involves milling
and homogenizing frozen anchovy (204 g) with the aid of an electric
blender and a first aliquot of d-limonene at 4 °C,
followed by overnight mild stirring in the presence of the biosolvent
(157.4 g).12 Following decanting, the solvent
is recovered by evaporation under reduced pressure (40 mbar) at 90
°C.

Scheme 1 Extraction of Oil and Fish Meal from Anchovy Discards Using d-Limonene as the Recyclable Extraction Solvent
Assuming to upscale the laboratory
process as such, processing
1 t of anchovy leftovers would afford approximately 14.7 kg of fish
oil. The latter oil containing traces of edible limonene (a flavor
with multiple health benefits)13 might
be used directly to manufacture omega-3 dietary supplements, without
the need of extensive refining to eventually convert the DHA and EPA
triglycerides present in crude anchovy oil (Peruvian fish oil sold
in early 2018 at $2600–2800/t)28 in their diethyl esters as it happens with current omega-3 purified
extract manufacturing processes.10

Today’s best omega-3 dietary supplements, indeed, contain
EPA and DHA in the triglyceride form (rather than as ethyl esters
present in most commercial omega-3 dietary supplements) as this leads
to a 70% higher increase in the omega-3 index when the ingredients
are consumed as triglycerides.29

Upon extraction with limonene, the oil-free semi-solid anchovy
residue comprised of milled leftovers rich in proteins, and bone minerals
would first undergo a pressing step common to most fish meal-manufacturing
processes, followed by a mild drying process to reduce the amount
of water below 12 wt % so as the ensure the formation of safely stored
fish meal. Such drying would be preferably carried out using a low
cost solar air dryer similar to those widely used across the world
to dry fish more rapidly and more effectively than in open air.30

Besides the initial purchase of citrus
limonene (eventually recycled
in consecutive extraction cycles), the two major costs that would
be faced by a company willing to extract fish oil from anchovy-(or
any other fish) processing waste would be (i) labor and (ii) electricity
needed to recover the bio-based solvent by evaporation under reduced
pressure. The price of citrus limonene has been increasing since 2007
and steeply again since 2013.31 Assuming
a $9/kg rate, purchase of 1296 kg of d-limonene to
process 1 t of anchovy leftovers would require a $11 664 investment.
The cost of electricity of the extraction company, in its turn, would
be dramatically reduced by self-producing power through a photovoltaic
(PV) plant whose cost, following the recent dramatic uptake of the
technology on a truly global scale,32 has
reached historic low levels (complete PV systems of nominal power
>30 kW currently routinely installed in Italy at <€1/W).

3 Conclusions
Extraction of anchovy fish oil
rich in omega-3 lipids from anchovy
discards using orange oil-derived d-limonene is advantageous
and economically and technically feasible. The capital investment
in the low-energy extraction setup, including the bio-based solvent13 and the solar air dryer,30 is relatively modest, and the operational costs are mostly
due to labor and electricity to separate the oil from the agro solvent.

Overall, the process cuts the cost of the conventional energy-intensive
extraction process, and the associated significant infrastructure
required first to manufacture refined fish oil typically containing
about 30% omega-3 fatty acids (18% in EPA and 12% in DHA) via several
consecutive steps including neutralization with alkalis, bleaching,
deodorization, and degumming.10 As the
solar and bioeconomy unfolds across the world,33 shifting omega-3 lipids extraction from blue fish to blue
fish waste is now possible, thanks to a natural solvent of exceptional
properties.

A leading practitioner of Australia’s health
food and supplements
industry lately suggested how the multi-billion-dollar success story
of omega-3 supplements in Australia was based on a foundation of quality
and innovation, within a regulatory framework encouraging consumer
trust.34 The same analyst forecasts that
“higher quality concentrated omega-3s will grow, particularly
in the natural and medical practitioner channels”.34 Extraction of fish oil rich in omega-3 from
anchovy leftovers using biobased limonene affords oil chiefly suited
for nutraceutical applications. Anchovy oil indeed is particularly
rich in cholecalciferol (vitamin D3),35 which, as shown by calculations reported herein, is highly
soluble in d-limonene.

Besides being a source
of essential omega-3 lipids, fish and fish
products are commonly regarded as the most important natural food
sources of vitamin D, a regulator of inflammation playing an important
role in the immune system, currently an underconsumed nutrient of
public health concern in several countries,36 for which dietary guidelines recommend increased intake either from
the few foods that contain it (oily fish, milk products, and mushrooms)
or through dietary supplements.
