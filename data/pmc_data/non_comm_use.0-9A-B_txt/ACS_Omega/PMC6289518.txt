In this study, an injectable thermoresponsive
hydroxypropyl guar-graft-poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)
(HPG-g-PNVCL) copolymer was synthesized by graft
polymerization.
The reaction parameters such as temperature, time, monomer, and initiator
concentrations were varied. In addition, the HPG-g-PNVCL copolymer was modified with nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) by
in situ covalent cross-linking using divinyl sulfone (DVS) cross-linker
to obtain HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS composite material.
Grafted copolymer and composite materials were characterized using
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR),
and differential scanning calorimetry. The morphology of the grafted
copolymer (HPG-g-PNVCL) and the composite (HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS) was examined using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), which showed interconnected porous honeycomb-like structures.
Using Ultraviolet−visible spectroscopy, low critical solution
temperature for HPG-g-PNVCL was observed at 34 °C,
which is close to the rheology gel point at 33.5 °C. The thermoreversibility
of HPG-g-PNVCL was proved by rheological analysis.
The HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel was employed for slow release
of the drug molecule. Ciprofloxacin, a commonly known antibiotic,
was used for sustainable release from the HPG-g-PNVCL
hydrogel as a function of time at 37 °C because of viscous nature
and thermogelation of the copolymer. In vitro cytotoxicity study reveals
that the HPG-g-PNVCL thermogelling polymer works
as a biocompatible scaffold for osteoblastic cell growth. Additionally,
in vitro biomineralization study of HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
was conducted using a simulated body fluid, and apatite-like structure
formation was observed by SEM.

1 Introduction
Injectable
polymer hydrogels, with their similar water content
to tissue, are a class of polymeric materials whose excellent shape
flexibility can mold them to defects of any size and shape via a minimally
invasive procedure.1,2 As a result, they have been widely
explored for potential use in the field of medicine.3−5 In this context, there has been a growing interest among researchers
in polymeric injectable hydrogel systems as candidates for developing
suitable artificial extracellular matrices (ECMs), for example, in
bone tissue regeneration.6,7 In such scenarios, researchers
have been focusing on developing a spectrum of biomaterials for tissue
engineering,8,9 including naturally occurring
materials to synthetically derived materials.10 One more area of interest in the similar direction is developing
a method for controlled drug delivery.11−13 Poor bioavailability
of conventional drug administration leads to lower patient compliance,
which results in severe side effects and even toxicity.14,15 In such cases, controlled drug delivery systems are providing hope
over a conventional dosage form. The most interesting feature of this
drug delivery system is to deliver the drugs at the desirable rate,
time, and specific sites to achieve the therapeutic objectives.16,17 Additionally, hydrogel materials are known to serve as a site for
localized drug delivery over a period of time for a wide range of
drugs.18

Generally speaking, there
are several injectable hydrogel systems
that have been developed using an aqueous solution of stimuli-responsive
polymers that gel in situ in response to pH, electric field, temperature,
and other environmental changes.19−23 In particular, temperature-responsive polymers are
widely employed in the preparation of injectable hydrogels for apatite
formation and drug delivery.24,25

Among various
thermoresponsive polymers, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM), a synthetic polymer, has been widely
studied as an injectable hydrogel for bone tissue regeneration and
drug delivery applications.26 PNIPAM’s
lower critical solution temperature (LCST) is low, with sol-to-gel
transition occurring at 32 °C.27 However,
application of PNIPAM is limited to injectable ECM development and
drug delivery because of its neurotoxicity28 and impairment of fibrinogen activity.29 However, an injectable thermoresponsive hydrogel fabricated using
minimally toxic biodegradable materials, such as poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL), would be the possible solution to overcome
the aforementioned problems. PNVCL has a phase transition temperature
of 33 °C, which is comparable to that of PNIPAM.30 PNVCL has excellent biocompatibility31 and low cytotoxicity,29 but
it lacks bioactivity and may cause inflammation and an immune response.32 Fortunately, these problems can be solved by
combining synthetic and natural polymers using methods such as graft
polymerization.33 In this context, guar
gum (GG) or its derivatives, hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), which are naturally
originated, biodegradable, and low-cost polymers, can be highly useful
to design degradable and biocompatible injectable thermoresponsive
polymers.34−36 Because GG and HPG contain several hydroxyl groups,
such polymers can be grafted chemically with PNVCL for making thermoresponsive
injectable hydrogels.37

Previous
studies have shown that the thermoresoponsive hydrogel
can be a substituent scaffold material to repair and replace bone.13,38,39 Human bone is mainly composed
of hydroxyapatite (HA) and collagen, which render both toughness and
high strength to bone. HA, which is a major inorganic component of
bone tissue, can be introduced with a hybrid hydrogel as a scaffold
to improve the mechanical property of bone in tissue engineering.40 For example, Wang et al. synthesized a novel
triblock injectable and thermosensitive hydrogel composite constituting
nano-HA (n-HA) as one of the components. The hydrogel has an interconnected
porous structure and exhibited very good thermosensitivity.38 Thus, n-HA is an excellent substituent material
for enhancing the bioactivity and mechanical properties of hydrogel
scaffolds, making it more suitable for bone tissue engineering.

As mentioned before, sustainable drug delivery using an injectable
hydrogel is an important area of research. Ciprofloxacin is one of
most efficient antimicrobial drugs used to treat and prevent the infections
caused by bacteria, including skin, eye, nose, and ear infections.41 Usually, restoration of tissues at the wound
area susceptible to bacterial infection can be avoided by antimicrobial
drugs loaded on injectable hydrogels.42−45 The injectable hydrogel loaded
with drugs at the specific injected site in the body slowly releases
the loaded drugs through its three-dimensional structure for a long
time. Additionally, such a hydrogel can also help to increase the
poor solubility of drugs in aqueous solution and minimize the side
effect associated with it. From these points of view, injectable hydrogels
based on external stimuli are of growing interest in the formulation
of drug delivery systems in recent years.11,12

Herein, we report the synthesis of a graft copolymer (HPG-g-PNVCL), which acts as an injectable thermoresponsive hydrogel
(Figure 1). The graft
polymer was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy,
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The copolymer (HPG-g-PNVCL) was found to be soluble in water, and the viscous
solution had an LCST of 34 °C. The thermoreversibility of the
grafted copolymer hydrogel was determined using rheology. The temperature-dependent
rheology study showed that the gelling point of the grafted copolymer
was 33.5 °C. The graft copolymer showed excellent thermogelling
and injectable properties suitable for in vitro osteoblast differentiation
and controlled drug delivery of ciprofloxacin. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first example of HPG modified with the PNVCL
polymer, which shows thermosensitive and injectable hydrogel properties
for various applications. Composite samples of a slightly chemically
cross-linked HPG-g-PNVCL and n-HA were also obtained
and studied. An in vitro biomineralization study was conducted using
a simulated body fluid (SBF), and apatite-like structure formation
was observed by SEM.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Graft
Copolymerization of HPG and NVCL
To study the effect of polymerization
time, temperature, monomer,
and initiator concentrations on the grafting yield, reaction conditions
were optimized during the synthesis of the HPG-g-PNVCL
graft copolymer. The effect of polymerization time on the grafting
yield was studied by varying the time between 1 and 5 h. As shown
in Figure 2a, the grafting
yield steadily increased as the polymerization time reached 3 h. The
propagation of the grafting chain increased with time because of the
accessibility of more active reaction sites on HPG, leading to a higher
grafting yield. However, after 3 h, a gradual decrease in grafting
yield was observed. This was attributed to a decrease in the monomer
and initiator concentration and mutual annihilation of growing chains.46

Figure 2 Effect of (a) time, (b) temperature, (c) NVCL concentration,
and
(d) AIBN concentration on grafting yield.

The effect of temperature, ranging from 55 to 80 °C,
on graft
copolymerization was observed; the results are shown in Figure 2b. When the temperature increased
from 55 to 65 °C, the grafting yield increased steadily, reaching
its maximum of 140%. This can be attributed to the increased N-vinylcaprolactam (NVCL) monomer diffusion into the reaction
site, accelerated decomposition of the initiator, and improvement
in the propagation step. Increasing the temperature above 65 °C
resulted in reduced grafting yield, which may be due to the enhanced
homopolymerization or the termination process by the combination and
disproportionation step and chain-transfer reactions. These results
are supported by similar findings obtained previously.46

The grafting yield was also studied by
changing the NVCL concentration
(0.2–0.6 M) while keeping all other parameters constant. As
shown in Figure 2c,
the grafting yield increased gradually with the increase in monomer
concentration up to 0.4 M, most likely because of the large availability
of monomer molecules around the HPG macroradical that leads to the
initiation and propagation of the grafting reaction. However, higher
concentrations of NVCL caused a decrease in grafting yield because
of the nonavailability of monomer molecules to attack the HPG macroradical,
as the homopolymerization rate of NVCL increases with increased monomer
concentration.46,47

Initiator concentration
is another important parameter that affects
the grafting yield. As shown in Figure 2d, when the azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) concentration
increased up to 2.2 × 10–3 M by keeping other
parameters constant, the grafting yield rapidly increased. Increased
AIBN concentration likely facilitated more HPG macroradicals through
the direct abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the hydroxyl propyl
group of the HPG backbone. This generated more active sites for NVCL
attachment, promoting the grafting process. However, upon further
increase in the initiator concentration, the grafting yield decreased
continuously, possibly because of the termination step with HPG macroradicals
overriding the initiation step. This trend of decrease in grafting
yield with increase in initiator concentration has also been observed
in previous studies.46,47

2.2 Characterizations
Following reaction
optimization, HPG-g-PNVCL was characterized using
different spectroscopic techniques. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the FTIR spectra of HPG, PNVCL,
HPG-g-PNVCL, and HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS.
Divinyl sulfone (DVS) was used to chemically cross-link HPG-g-PNVCL. A very strong and broad absorption band observed
at 3349 cm–1 (Figure S1a, Supporting Information) for HPG is due to O–H bond stretching frequency,
whereas the sharp peak located at around 2880 cm–1 is attributed to C–H stretching frequency. A bending of CH2–O–CH2 units of HPG appears at 1014
cm–1 stretching frequency.48 Figure S1b (Supporting Information) shows
two peaks at 1627 and 1483 cm–1 that correspond
to carbonyl (C=O) bond stretching and amide (C–N) stretching
present in PNVCL, respectively.49 In the
HPG-g-PNVCL spectrum (Figure S1c, Supporting Information), the increased intensity of O–H
bond stretching at 3617 cm–1 was observed and it
proves the grafting of PNVCL on HPG. Furthermore, peaks arising due
to C=O stretching vibration at 1627 cm–1 and
C–N bending vibration at 1474 cm–1 illustrate
the successful grafting of PNVCL on HPG.49 Compared to HPG-g-PNVCL, the FTIR spectrum of HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS (Figure S1e, Supporting Information) shows a slight decrease in the intensity of O–H
bond stretching frequency. Additionally, the appearance of phosphate
(PO43–) asymmetric bond stretching at
1024 cm–1 arising from n-HA (Figure S1d, Supporting Information) and the presence of S=O
bond stretching frequency at 1130 cm–1 indicate
the successful cross-linking of the hydroxyl groups of HPG by DVS
in HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS.50

Further confirmation on the structural features of HPG-g-PNVCL was obtained by proton NMR (1H NMR) spectroscopy.
Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows
the 1H NMR spectra of HPG and HPG-g-PNVCL. 1H NMR of HPG shows a broad peak in the range of 3.3–4.1
ppm (a, b, c, and d), which was assigned to all protons present in
the guar carbohydrate structures.50 Additionally,
similar peaks are also visible in HPG-g-PNVCL in
the same region, indicating the covalent grafting of HPG with PNVCL.
In the HPG-g-PNVCL NMR spectrum, methylene (CH2) groups of the caprolactam ring in the vicinity of N and
C=O groups are assigned to 3.4 ppm (a) and 2.5 ppm (b), respectively.
Similar peak positions for CH2 groups adjacent to N and
C=O groups were observed in the PNVCL homopolymer as reported
in the previous literature.51 Therefore,
grafting of PNVCL on the HPG polymer backbone is also confirmed by 1H NMR.

TGA is a crucial method to characterize and verify
the thermal
stability of different materials. TGA results obtained at the scan
rate of 10 °C/min in N2 atmosphere for HPG, HPG-g-PNVCL, and HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS are presented
in Figure S3 (Supporting Information).
HPG showed two different temperature zones of weight loss. HPG began
losing water at 40 °C and continued up to 102 °C. The maximum
weight loss occurred in the second zone, representing the degradation
of the HPG backbone, which started at 240 °C and continued up
to 358 °C as revealed by the analysis.52 As shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), HPG-g-PNVCL showed a slightly different pattern
compared to HPG. The initial weight loss profile in the region of
40–110 °C is essentially due to the removal of water.
Furthermore, the thermal degradation profile of HPG-g-PNVCL showed the weight loss from 216 to 333 °C, which is indicative
of the depolymerization of the HPG polymer chain, and it is slightly
shifted compared to pure HPG. In addition to two degradation zones
as shown in HPG, a third degradation zone which appeared in the region
of 375–541 °C with 4.7 wt % weight loss, resulting from
the incorporation of PNVCL chains into the HPG backbone.52 However, the absence of significant weight loss
in HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS (with 50 wt % residues) above
400 °C compared to HPG and HPG-g-PNVCL is attributed
to the increase in thermal stability, additional cross-linking, and
good interaction of HPG-g-PNVCL polymers with thermally
stable n-HA.53,54

Figure S4 (Supporting Information) indicates
DSC results for HPG, HPG-g-PNVCL, and HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS scaffolds. DSC was performed in the temperature
range of 25–600 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min
under N2 atmosphere. The HPG thermogram showed two major
endothermic peaks at 93 and 295 °C, respectively. The first endothermic
peak at 93 °C is attributed to the removal of moisture, whereas
the second endothermic peak observed at 295 °C is due to the
thermal decomposition of main-chain HPG polymers.52 In contrast to HPG, HPG-g-PNVCL exhibited
an additional endothermic melting peak at 439 °C, which may be
attributed to the grafted PNVCL chain on the HPG backbone.51 In HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS, there
was no significant change in the thermogram observed as compared to
HPG-g-PNVCL.

SEM images were obtained to characterize
the microstructural morphologies
of the lyophilized materials. The cross-sectional SEM images of lyophilized
HPG-g-PNVCL and HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
hydrogels are presented in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3a,b, after lyophilization, the HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel showed a continuous porous honeycomb-like structure
because of freezing of the hydrogel, which creates ice crystals in
the inner morphology of the sample and subsequent vacuum removal of
ice crystals from the hydrogel structure produces porous morphology.55 SEM imaging of the HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
hydrogel (Figure 3c,d),
on the other hand, showed a more planar-like morphology with relatively
less porous structures because of the cross-linking with DVS and the
further addition of n-HA resulted in the thicker and denser pore walls.56 Additionally, a good dispersion of n-HA (shown
by red arrows) in the cross-linked HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
was observed.

and

2.3 LCST Measurement
The thermoresponsivity
of aqueous solutions of 1 wt % HPG and HPG-g-PNVCL
determined by the LCST measurement is given in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the transmittance response of the hydrogels
measured at 470 nm over the temperature range of 20–50 °C.
Initially, HPG did not show any phase transition in the given temperature
range (especially near body temperature). However, HPG-g-PNVCL showed an optical transmittance of 44% when the temperature
was below 34 °C and had almost zero transmittance above this
temperature. Thus, the LCST was found to be 34 °C because of
the presence of thermosensitive PNVCL graft chains.51Figure 4b shows excellent flowability of the HPG-g-PNVCL
hydrogel at room temperature with no gel formation and a relatively
transparent appearance of the hydrogel. When the hydrogel was exposed
to a temperature of 37 °C (near body temperature), it became
a gel (<15 min), as shown in Figure 4c. Furthermore, an injectability test (3 wt % in distilled
water) was conducted, and the gel showed good injectability in the
solution at 37 °C (Figure 4d–g).

2.4 Rheology
Study and Apatite Formation Ability
of Scaffolds
An oscillatory shear rheometer was used to find
the rheological properties of HPG and HPG-g-PNVCL
at a heating rate of 1 °C/min over a 25–40 °C temperature
range. Figure 5 shows
the thermosensitive gelation behavior of HPG and HPG-g-PNVCL suspended in distilled water at 1% (w/v). In the case of HPG,
when the temperature is increased from 25 to 34 °C, the value
of the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus
(G″) increased, and no crossover between them
was observed at around 40 °C (Figure 5a), indicating that they maintained a viscous
liquid-like behavior until 40 °C. In contrast, in the HPG-g-PNVCL sample, as the temperature increased, a crossover
between G′ and G″
was observed at a critical point, the gel point (Tgel), where tan δ (δ = G″/G′) = 1 and the sol–gel transition occurs.53 An elastic solid-like behavior was observed
beyond this gel point.56 Thus, the gelation
temperature (Tgel) of HPG-g-PNVCL was found to be 33.5 °C (Figure 5b), which corresponds well with the LCST
results obtained from the phase transition diagram (Figure 4a). From these results, it
can be concluded that HPG-g-PNVCL is thermoresponsive
around the body temperature.

Figure 5 Rheological properties of G′ and G″ for 1 wt % aqueous suspension
of (a) HPG and (b)
HPG-g-PNVCL.

The thermoreversibility of HPG-g-PNVCL was
further
evaluated by a second temperature sweep of G′
and G″ after the sample was cooled down to
the initial temperature (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the two graphs are almost overlapped,
indicating that the sol–gel transition was reversible. A slight
reduction in sample diameter was observed, most likely because of
water loss after the initial heating cycle.

We have used the
thermoresponsive hydrogel for in vitro slow release
of a pharmaceutically relevant drug molecule. Figure 6 shows the cumulative percentage of ciprofloxacin
released from the HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel as a function
of time at 37 °C. The release studies of ciprofloxacin were examined
by UV–vis spectroscopy of the solution taken at predetermined
time intervals. Ciprofloxacin release from 3 wt % HPG-g-PNVCL, 4 wt % HPG-g-PNVCL, and 5 wt % HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogels showed a biphasic manner with initial
burst release, followed by controlled release pattern of sustained
release. In vitro drug release profiles of different concentrations
of HPG-g-PNVCL are shown in Figure 6. HPG-g-PNVCL (3 wt %) exhibits
higher release than 5 wt % HPG-g-PNVCL, whereas 4
wt % HPG-g-PNVCL exhibits an intermediate release
pattern, indicating the dependence of drug release on the concentration
of HPG-g-PNVCL. For instance, the release is slower
for formulation containing a high concentration of HPG-g-PNVCL. This may be due to the presence of higher grafted polymers,
which undergo chain entanglements among themselves, leading to the
entrapment of drug molecules tightly and releasing in a controlled
manner.

Figure 6 In vitro drug release profile of ciprofloxacin from the injectable
HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel with various concentrations
(3–5 wt %). The study was performed at 37 °C.

To check the utility of HPG-g-PNVCL
as a scaffold,
we grew mouse osteoblastic MC3T3 cells on it for various time periods
to determine precisely the extent to which cells grew on the HPG-g-PNVCL scaffolds. Figure 7 shows the results of cell growths on the HPG-g-PNVCL scaffold obtained for the time period of 24 (a),
48 (b), and 72 h (c), respectively. In these studies, a control and
HPG-g-PNVCL scaffolds were tested. After seeding
of cells, most cells in the HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel
were found to be viable. As revealed in Figure 7, MC3T3 cells remained drastically viable
compared to control in the HPG-g-PNVCL scaffold hydrogel
for 24, 48, and 72 h after encapsulation. After 24 h of cell culture,
there was a drastic increase in viable cell counts on HPG-g-PNVCL scaffolds (>5 folds) compared to the control. Figure 7c shows that viable
cell counts on HPG-g-PNVCL continued to increase
and reached to more than 5-fold in 3 days (72 h) compared to the control.
These in vitro studies demonstrate that HPG-g-PNVCL
would be a good choice as a scaffold material for bone tissue engineering.
As discussed previously, highly biocompatible nature of HPG of the
HPG-g-PNVCL scaffold is important for better cell
growth and proliferation. These data prove the general applicability
of the HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel for culture and transplantation
of viable cells in tissue engineering.

studies of the injectable thermoresponsive
HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogels at (a) 24, (b) 48, and (c)
72 h. The data were compared against the control surface which is
just the cell culture plate.

The in vitro biomineralization (apatite formation ability)
of the
HPG-g-PNVCL and HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
biocomposite scaffolds was evaluated by immersing them in an SBF solution
for 14 days. The results are shown in Figure 8. We have found that HPG-g-PNVCL shows a thermogel behavior near body temperature. However,
the gel is not strong enough that can be used in an aqueous environment
for long time. Therefore, we decided to use DVS, which can form additional
chemical cross-linking furnishing a strong gel suitable for prolonged
water exposure and utilization. Recently, several studies have shown
that carbohydrate polymers which contain hydroxyl (−OH) or
amine (−NH2) functionalities could be cross-linked
by DVS. DVS reacts with −OH or −NH2 groups
of the polymers via Michael addition either intra- or intermolecularly
to form cross-linked gels.57 Therefore,
HPG, which has plenty of −OH groups, can be easily cross-linked
in a slightly alkaline water solution using DVS and such a cross-linking
reaction can proceed even at 25 °C.58,59

and HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS after (c) 7 and (d) 14 days.

SBF solution is ionic in nature
mimicking human blood plasma and
it was prepared according to the previous experimental procedures.57 Additionally, after soaking in SBF for stipulated
time, each sample was washed with distilled water and dried in an
oven for further studies. Because of the absence of n-HA, the HPG-g-PNVCL scaffold did not exhibit apatite-like formation
(Ca/P ratio = 0; Figure 8a). The initial Ca/P ratio in HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
before SBF immersion (day 0) was 0.83 (Figure 8b), so the initial scaffold was a calcium-deficient
apatite-like biocomposite, because in stoichiometric HA, the Ca/P
ratio is 1.67.60 However, we found the
deposition of apatite-like particles (and particle aggregates) on
the HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS scaffold surface after immersion
in SBF for 7 and 14 days. These deposits were caused by the initiation
of apatite nuclei on the scaffold surface, which produced crystals
by absorbing more calcium (Ca2+) and phosphorous (PO43–) from the SBF, thus displaying bioactivity.
After a 7 day period, the Ca/P ratio increased from 0.83 to 2.00—similar
to the Ca/P ratio in stoichiometric HA (1.67) and the theoretical
Ca/P ratio in human bone (1.75).60 After
14 days, formation of apatite on the surface was slightly greater.
These results confirm that calcium-rich apatite was deposited on the
scaffold’s surface forming a bone-like structure and composition.

3 Conclusions
In this study, HPG was successfully
grafted with NVCL using AIBN
as the initiator to synthesize HPG-g-PNVCL. The polymer
was characterized using various analytical techniques. HPG-g-PNVCL showed excellent thermal stability, as well as thermoresponsive
behavior at ∼34 °C and a reversible soluble-insoluble
characteristic. The hydrogel (HPG-g-PNVCL) was found
to be highly promising for sustained controlled delivery of macromolecular
drugs as an injectable form. Additionally, the HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel also performed as an excellent scaffold for osteoblast
cell differentiation. A chemically cross-linked hydrogel containing
the n-HA (HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS) scaffold was obtained
to enhance the mechanical strength of the hydrogel and employed in
in vitro biomineralization study. The scaffold showed apatite-like
structure formation on the surface after soaking for 7 days in SBF
solution. As the immersion period was increased up to 14 days, the
Ca/P ratio also increased. Therefore, this novel n-HA-containing biocompatible
and plant-based hydrogel has promising potential applications in bone
tissue regeneration because of its calcium-rich apatite-forming ability
and good bioactivity.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 General
HPG with a specific gravity
of 1.47 was obtained from Halliburton, USA, as a gift. AIBN, ethanol,
n-HA, and acetone were all obtained from VWR International, USA, and
used as received without further purification, unless otherwise noted.
DVS and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA. NVCL was purchased from Alfa Aesar, USA. Ultrahigh purity nitrogen
gas was obtained from NLR Welding Supply, USA. Doubly distilled water
was used throughout the experiments. The FTIR spectra of HPG, PNVCL,
HPG-g-PNVCL, and HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
were collected using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer,
USA. The spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range of 400–4000
cm–1 using a standard KBr pellet method. The 1H NMR spectra of the samples (HPG and HPG-g-PNVCL) were collected at 25 °C with a JEOL ECS 400 MHz spectrometer
(USA) that has a 5 mm triple resonance inverse probe. The chemical
shifts were represented in parts per million with D2O as
a solvent. SEM images were recorded using a scanning electron microscope
(JSM 7000F JEOL, USA). The dried samples for the SEM imaging were
obtained by freeze-drying the hydrogels using Labconco FreeZone 2.5
L freeze dryers, USA. The UV–vis spectra were recorded using
a Varian Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer, USA.
For rheological measurements, a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer (HR-1,
TA Instruments, USA) with a parallel-plate geometry was used. TGA
and DSC were performed using a TGA/DSC 3+ analyzer and a DSC 823e
analyzer (Mettler-Toledo, UK), respectively. Mouse osteoblastic cells
(MC3T3), minimum essential medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA,
USA. Fetal bovine serum, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide
(MTT), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA.

4.2 Synthesis of the Graft
Copolymer of HPG-g-PNVCL
Reactions were
performed under a nitrogen
atmosphere in a 250 mL three-necked flask that was immersed in a constant
temperature bath and equipped with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser,
and gas inlet system, as described previously.46 In brief, HPG (0.25 g) was dissolved in 12.5 mL of distilled
water with constant stirring at room temperature for 2 h. The desired
amount of NVCL which was initially dissolved in 6.25 mL of distilled
water was added to the above solution, and the mixture was stirred
under a slow stream of nitrogen. The mixture was placed in an oil
bath set at 65 °C and stirred for 10 min. After that, the desired
concentration of the AIBN initiator (dissolved in 2 mL of acetone)
was slowly added to the reaction mixture, followed by the addition
of distilled water to reach a total volume of 50 mL. As soon as AIBN
was added, the free radical graft polymerization of NVCL started.
The whole reaction mixture was kept under constant stirring under
an inert nitrogen atmosphere. At the end of the polymerization time,
copious amount of acetone was added to the reaction mixture to precipitate
out the product. The resultant precipitate was collected by filtration
and washed with absolute ethanol four times to remove any homopolymer
(PNVCL). The obtained solid product (HPG-g-PNVCL
graft copolymer) was vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 12 h to a constant
weight. A scheme for the synthesis of HPG-g-PNVCL
is given in Figure 1. The grafting yield was calculated using eq 1. 1  where W0 and W1 are the initial and final weights of ungrafted
(HPG) and grafted polymer (HPG-g-PNVCL), respectively.

4.3 LCST Determination
The LCST of the
1 wt % HPG and HPG-g-PNVCL aqueous solutions in distilled
water was determined by measuring the absorbance at 470 nm from 20
to 50 °C using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. Prior to the
measurement, the hydrogels were equilibrated in a thermostatic water
bath for at least 10 min to ensure a stable temperature. The temperature
corresponding to the sudden drop in transmittance between 30 and 40
°C was defined as the LCST.

4.4 In Vitro
Drug Release Study
Drug
release studies were conducted using an incubator shaker at 37 °C.
Ciprofloxacin was used as a model drug. To determine the release of
ciprofloxacin from the injectable HPG-g-PNVCL hydrogel,
an experimental system was followed according to previous studies
with slight modifications.61 Initially,
the graft copolymer was dissolved in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) in each vial
with different concentrations of 3, 4, and 5 wt %, respectively. One
milliliter of prepared solution with ciprofloxacin (6 mg/mL) was poured
into test tubes (diameter = 12 mm). Test tubes were kept at 37 °C
for thermal gelation, and then a release medium (PBS, pH 7.4) of 10
mL was added to each test tube. Then, 3 mL sample aliquot was withdrawn
at different time intervals to evaluate the released content of the
drug, and 3 mL of fresh release media was replenished back to maintain
the sink conditions. The amount of ciprofloxacin released was analyzed
using UV–vis spectroscopy at 377 nm (λmax).
Ciprofloxacin standard curve was obtained using known concentrations
of the drug and used to determine the amount of drug released.

4.5 MTT Assay
Cytotoxicity studies were
performed using osteoblastic MC3T3 cells by the MTT assay as described
previously.62 To study the cytotoxicity
of the scaffold material, an MTT assay was performed. In this assay,
the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity was used as an
indicator of cell viability, where mitochondria-dependent reduction
of MTT to formazan was measured spectrophotometrically. Prior to using
the HPG-g-PNVCL copolymer for the cytotoxicity study,
this material was sterilized by washing with absolute ethanol several
times and then exposing to UV light for 5 h in fume hood. For this
study, 6 wt % solution of HPG-g-PNVCL was used. A
24-well cell culture plate was used for the study. Initially, 250
μL of HPG-g-PNVCL was taken in the cell culture
plate. The plate was then kept at 37 °C for 2 h. This method
ensures thermogelling sol-to-gel transition of the polymer. The provided
scaffold was sterilized under UV light for 5 h before use. Approximately
1.5 × 104 cells/mL per well were seeded in 48-well
plates directly in the absence of a scaffold to serve as a control
and onto the solidified scaffold for stipulated time period. After
the cells were grown on the scaffold for a predetermined time period,
the HPG-g-PNVCL scaffold with cells attached to it
was transferred into fresh multiwell plates and to the well 400 μL
of the fresh cell culture medium supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL MTT
solution was added. The cells were incubated for an additional 4 h
in the dark condition. Thereafter, the medium was discarded, and 400
μL of DMSO was added to the well. The plate was then wrapped
with an aluminum foil and placed on a shaker for 10 min to dissolve
the purple insoluble MTT formazan complex. A small aliquot of 100 μL
of DMSO containing MTT formazan solution was transferred to a new
96-well plate, and the absorbance was then measured at 570 nm using
an automated microplate reader (Benchmark Plus, Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, California, USA). The cell viability data were obtained
as % of the control values obtained from untreated cells. We consider
here control as just regular MC3T3 cells in medium under normal condition.
All measurements were performed in triplicate and repeated independently
at least three times.

4.6 Synthesis of HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
Our strategy was to modify HPG-g-PNVCL with n-HA
to form bone apatite in situ because n-HA, a major component of natural
bone, is osteoconductive, biodegradable, and bioactive,36,63 improving its use in biomedical applications such as bone defect
treatments.64 Also, for bone replacement
applications, we need a stronger hydrogel. In situ covalent cross-linking
of the hydrogel system at 37 °C in the presence of a chemical
cross-linker such as DVS is a suitable option. DVS is widely used
as a cross-linker because of its reactivity, stability, low cost,
and solubility in water. DVS has a high chemical affinity to various
polysaccharide networks such as dextran, agarose, cellulose, and hyaluronic
acid because of the presence of two electrophilic double bonds.65 Combining the thermogelling property of modified
guar and the chemical cross-linking of DVS, it is possible to develop
an injectable material with the desired mechanical properties for
bone tissue engineering. To synthesize a DVS cross-linked gel, at
first 30 mg of the HPG-g-PNVCL graft copolymer was
mixed with 1 mL of distilled water in a test tube. The mixture was
then vortexed until it became a clear solution. Then, 40 mg (2 wt
%) of n-HA was added, and the mixture was sonicated for 1 h. Subsequently,
15 μL of DVS was added in order to initiate the cross-linking
of the polymer composite, primarily through −OH bonds of HPG
in HPG-g-PNVCL. The HPG-g-PNVCL/n-HA/DVS
cross-linked hydrogel was formed after incubation of the mixture in
an oven maintained at 37 °C for a certain period. After that,
the purified cross-linked hydrogel was obtained by washing with distilled
water until a neutral pH was achieved for the washing liquid.
