Three molecules containing
the fluorophore 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide
(ANI) and showing different tendencies to self-assembly in aqueous
environment have been prepared and fully characterized. The fluorescence
emissions of two of these compounds in aqueous solutions are efficiently
quenched in the presence of nitric oxide (NO) in aerated medium. Nuclear
magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry techniques indicate that
NO/O2 induces deamination of the ANI fluorophore, resulting
in nonemissive 1,8-naphtalimide derivatives. It is found that the
reactivity toward NO/O2 is regulated by the different aggregation
modes presented by the molecules in aqueous medium. In this way, the
molecules displaying fluorescence response toward NO/O2 are those with weak self-association properties whereas the compound
with a high hydrophobic character (self-assembling into large nanoparticles)
is insensitive to this species. Ultimately, the results described
here could not only set the basis for the design of fluorescent bioprobes
for NO/O2 based on ANI derivatives or other monoamino compounds
but also could raise awareness about the importance of supramolecular
interactions for the design of chemosensors.

Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is
a molecule playing numerous roles at the biological
level.1 It has been identified as a messenger
molecule,2 a vasodilator,3 antibacterial agent,4,5 and also has been associated
to disorders such as cancer6 or Alzheimer’s
disease.7 Hence, its detection by spectroscopic
techniques is of great practical importance not only to develop diagnostic
tools but also for the understanding of the biochemical mechanisms
of action of this elusive molecule. A series of approaches have been
followed to detect NO in biological samples, such as the use of electron
spin resonance,8 electrochemistry,9 or fluorescence spectroscopy.10 The latter technique has unique advantages, such as high
sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution.11 A great number of fluorescent probes have been described in the
literature so far,12−29 and a series of excellent reviews summarize different chemical strategies
followed by a plethora of researchers in this field.10,30−33 The most frequently used strategy for NO detection is the utilization
of probes containing the ortho-phenylenediamino structure.
The reaction of such units with nitric oxide, in aerated medium, is
well-known, yielding triazole aromatic derivatives whose optical properties
are distinct from those of the original diamine molecule. However,
this approach, although extremely useful for elucidating the mechanisms
of action of NO, suffers from some drawbacks. One of such issues is
the complexity of the synthetic routes followed to make the sensor,
often leading to only a few milligrams of the probe. Another problem
is selectivity, since it has been reported, in some cases, that dicarbonyl
metabolites, such as dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and methylglyoxal
(MGO, pyruvaldehyde), lead to emissive products that can be wrongly
interpreted as positives for NO.34−38 An alternative approach consists in the use of monoamino
aromatic compounds, taking advantage of the well-known reaction of
amino groups with NO in oxygenated media to afford diazonium salts,
which, under certain circumstances, leads to loss of N2.39−41 This deamination strategy has been already explored in a limited
number of cases in the field of sensing. For instance, Wang and co-workers
used a fluorescein derivative bearing a single amino group which,
upon reaction with NO in aerated aqueous medium, led to a deaminated
product displaying strong fluorescence.42 In another example, Guo and co-workers have reported BODIPY dyes
bearing monoamino functionalities that react with NO in aerated medium
with notable velocity.43 Recently, an acustogenic
probe for NO has been designed using the reactivity of monoamino aromatics.44 We have reported a series of pyrylium dyes for
NO bioimaging following analogous principles.18 The simplicity of introducing a single amino group in the sensing
system is advantageous from the synthetic point of view, and it has
allowed to produce nonconventional NO sensing structures. For instance,
a metal–organic framework was developed by the group of Gosh
using this type of approach.26 The same
strategy is also valid for the detection of nitrite (NO2–) anion since this species, in acidic medium,
is able to perform the conversion of the amino group into the diazonium
moiety via the intermediate nitrous anhydride (N2O3). Thus, systems for the analysis of NO2– include functionalized gold nanoparticles with organic ligands bearing
aniline units45 or upconversion nanoparticles
attached to a dye having a primary amino group in its structure.46 Considering the promising perspectives of this
approach for the development of nitric oxide and nitrite sensors,
it is likely that in the future, a number of probes based on compounds
with a single −NH2 group will be developed.

One of the most popular fluorophores used so far in the broad area
of fluorescence chemical sensing and bioimaging is 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide
(ANI). It has been used to develop sensors and a number of materials
of varied functions.47,48 We envisaged that the amino group
present in this fluorophore could be removed by reaction with NO in
aerated medium (and hence also by acidic nitrite), and as a consequence,
this moiety could be used for the development of optical probes for
NO and nitrite (see Scheme 1). In this paper, we explore the feasibility of that idea
by testing three derivatives containing an ANI unit. Recently, we
reported that compound 3 consisting of an ANI fluorophore
linked to the dipeptide GlyVal formed self-assembled fibrillary networks
and their optical properties were described in acetonitrile.49 Here, we analyze the reactivity of this compound
and the analogs 1 and 2 in aerated aqueous
media toward NO. Two points are specifically addressed here: on one
hand, the reactivity of the ANI moiety and on the other hand, how
it is affected by the tendency of aggregation of the reacting molecules.
Overall, this study is aimed to provide a conceptual background for
future optimized fluorescent sensors based on this fluorophore.

Scheme 1 Studied Molecules and Reactivity Toward Aerated NO or Acidic Nitrite
Results and Discussion
Aggregation
Behavior
Compound 1 showed
no aggregation in the experimental conditions used (H2O/dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) 9:1, 10 μM), forming transparent solutions
even at concentrations in the millimolar range. On the other hand,
compounds 2 and 3 form aggregates under
these conditions, which could be detected by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) (Figure 1), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
DLS (number-averaged) analysis revealed monomodal distributions corresponding
to nanoparticles with a diameter of 131 ± 5 nm in the case of
compound 3 and 422 ± 14 nm in the case of compound 2. TEM and SEM images of nanoparticles (Figure 2a,c) are in agreement with these observations,
showing spherical objects whose size is in agreement with that observed
by DLS. In the case of compound 2, aggregates could be
visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), revealing
a uniform distribution of rather monodisperse fluorescent objects
(Figure 2b). The formation
of micro and nanoparticles in aqueous media by an analog of compound 3 has been recently described by us.50 On moving from micromolar to millimolar concentrations, compound 3 forms molecular gels composed of self-assembled fibrillar
networks (Figure 2c)
whereas compound 2 affords amorphous solids.

of Dn = 422 ± 14 and 131 ± 5
nm, respectively.

Images of gels of 3 showing fibrillar structures (high
concentration); (d) SEM images of nanoparticles of 3 (low
concentration).

The analysis of the fluorescence
of stabilized suspensions of 2 and 3 suggests
that the arrangement of ANI
units in the self-assembled structures differs notably. As can be
seen in Figure 3, the
fluorescence maximum of 3 occurs at 546 nm (yellow color
emission) whereas that of 2 experiences a strong hypsochromic
shift to 507 nm (green color emission). These differences could be
ascribed to a different solvation of the ANI units: the emitting fluorophores
in 3 would be exposed to the aqueous environment (in
such polar environment the emission would have a strong ICT character,
typical of the ANI fluorophore); however, the environment of 2 would be clearly hydrophobic and hence the ANI moieties
would be surrounded by organic residues, hidden away from the aqueous
medium. Compound 1, bearing a carboxylic acid functional
group and fully soluble, emits yellow fluorescence, same as 3, with a maximum at 546 nm.

Figure 3 Normalized fluorescence spectra of suspensions
of 2 and 3 at 10 μM in H2O/DMSO (9:1);
λexc = 433 nm.

Reactivity Toward NO and NO2–
The reactivity of 1–3 toward NO
and NO2– was assayed for 10 μM
samples in H2O/DMSO (9:1). First, a preliminary test was
conducted with 3 in the presence of NO excess (bubbled),
revealing a complete quenching of the fluorescence emission of this
compound at 546 nm. An analogous assay was conducted to test the reactivity
toward acidic nitrite. Hence, when a solution of nanoparticles of 3 was exposed to 0.5 mM nitrite in 2% acetic acid, a rapid
loss of emission took place, along with a change in the color of the
suspension. To rationalize these results, an analysis of the reaction
with NO using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was conducted. Comparison
of the 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction product with the
spectrum of a model compound without the amino group (see Figure 4), prepared as reported
elsewhere,50 confirmed that deamination
was the main reaction taking place.

Figure 4 From top to bottom: 1H NMR
spectra of 3 before reaction, after reaction with NO
(g) excess, and of a model
compound without the amino group (synthesized as described in ref (50)).

Deamination of 3 was unequivocally confirmed
by mass
spectrometry, as can be seen in Figure 5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the reactivity
toward aerated NO of the ANI fluorophore proceeds via deamination.
As a matter of fact, the deamination of anilines is a well-known reaction
described frequently for synthetic purposes.39−41 It is important
to remark that loss of NH2 is the sole reaction taking
place in our specific conditions, although other potential reactions
could occur, such as hydroxylation (already well documented for other
monoamino aromatics).51,52 Nevertheless, the important idea
to remark here is that reactivity of a single amino group can lead
to important optical changes and hence can be used for bioanalytical
purposes, as other sensors described in the Introduction section. However, other elements of the molecular architecture,
not only the emitting fluorophore, should be also considered, as will
be shown in the following discussion, since they play a key role in
the feasibility of this strategy.

Figure 5 From top to bottom: high-resolution mass
spectra of 3 before reaction, after reaction with NO
(g) excess, and model compound
without the amino group (synthesized as described in ref (50)).

Next, the fluorescence responses of 1–3 toward controlled concentrations of NO were compared. To
this end, the NO donor 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-hydrazine sodium
salt (DEA NONOate) was used.53 Incremental
amounts of DEA NONOate were added to 10 μM samples of 1–3, and the response was monitored by
fluorescence spectroscopy. The intensity of emission at the maximum
was plotted against the concentration of released NO. It is important
to note that samples are air-equilibrated otherwise the reaction does
not proceed. The formation of the nitrosating species nitrous anhydride
is a requisite for the reaction to occur, since the loss of nitrogen
proceeds via the formation of the intermediate diazonium salt, as
described in the literature for other aromatic amines.39−41

Compounds 1 and 3 react with aerated
NO in a dose-dependent manner, as can be seen in Figure 6. From the onset of the curves
in Figure 6, an approximate
limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 μM for 1 and 2
μM for 3 can be estimated. The assay was repeated
with 3 in the presence of less DMSO (only 1%), resulting
also in the same sensitivity (see Supporting Information, Figure S7). Although stabilization times for
the above experiments were set at 8 h to assure completion of the
reactions, it must be mentioned that these processes are actually
much faster. As it can be seen in the Supporting Information, completion of the deamination reaction can take
place in a much shorter time. Moreover, the reactions were repeated
in the presence of DHA (10 μM) and MGO (10 μM) as potential
interfering species and, as can be seen in the Supporting Information, the effect on the reactivity was negligible.

Figure 6 Normalized
fluorescence intensity of 1–3 vs
[NO] in H2O/DMSO (9:1), 2% AcOH. [1–3] = 10 μM; [NO] = 0.37, 0.74, 1.8, 3.7,
7.5, 18.5, 37.5, 73.5, and 111 μM; λexc = 420
nm.

The different behaviors shown
by 1 and 3 could be attributable to the
fact that 1 remains completely
soluble in the aqueous medium due to the presence of a carboxylic
acid in its structure whereas 3 tends to form small nanoparticles
(see DLS, TEM, and SEM results presented above). But the most striking
behavior is that of compound 2, which is completely insensitive
to NO in the assayed concentration range. In Figure 7, a representative set of spectra can be
seen for compounds 2 and 3. To explain the
difference, the distinct emission shown by 2 (green fluorescence)
as compared to that of 1 and 3 (yellow fluorescence)
must be recalled. Previously, it has been suggested that the different
emission must be related to the distinct environment of the ANI fluorophores,
solvated by water molecules in the case of 1 and 3 or buried in a hydrophobic aggregate in the case of 2. The lack of reactivity of 2 toward NO/O2 supports this hypothesis. Besides, it should be noticed that
compound 2 is much more hydrophobic (C log P = 7.7) than 3 (C log P = 2.5) and therefore
rather strong solvophobic interactions are most likely present in
the aggregates of 2.

Figure 7 Representative variation of fluorescence
spectra of compounds 3 (a) and 2 (b) with
increasing concentrations
of NO (0, 0.37, 0.74, 1.8, 3.7, 7.5, 18.5, 37.5, 73.5, and 111 μM)
in H2O/DMSO (9:1) and 2% AcOH. λexc =
420 nm.

An additional experiment was conducted
to get a confirmation of
the solvophobic environment of the ANI fluorophores in the stabilized
suspensions of 2. It was hypothesized that, prior to
the formation of the observed large nanoparticles (see Figure 1), the individual molecules
solvated in the aqueous medium could be detected, if measurements
were taken at the beginning of the self-assembly process. Thus, a
solution of 2 in DMSO was injected into water (reaching
a ratio H2O/DMSO of 9:1) and the emission spectrum of the
suspension was monitored from the moment of the injection. As can
be seen in Figure 8a, the emission at t = 0 min displays a maximum
at 551 nm, thus revealing the fluorophore in an aqueous environment
(like 1 and 3) but this fluorescence changes
gradually with time until it is transformed into the green emission
peaking at 507 nm (with a certain contribution of the long wavelength
emission, as can be noticed by the shoulder in the spectrum). The
kinetics of this aggregation is shown in Figure 8b. Aliquots of this suspension were simultaneously
analyzed by DLS (Figure 8c) and a drastic increase in the diameter of the nanoparticles was
found, in close parallelism with the changes in the emission profiles.
This fact confirms the transformation from free molecules to aggregates
where the ANI fluorophores are buried inside a hydrophobic environment,
not accessible to NO/O2.

in the main text); (b) monitorization of the fluorescence intensity

monitorization of the formation of nanoparticles of 2 by means of DLS.

Conclusions
The
reactivity of three ANI derivatives, 1–3, toward dissolved nitric oxide in aerated medium has been
studied. Compound 1 is fully soluble in aqueous medium,
but 2 and 3 tend to aggregate. DLS, electron
microscopy (SEM, TEM), and confocal microscopy studies reveal that
compounds 2 and 3 self-associate to form
nanoparticles with diameters of ca. 420 and 130 nm, respectively.
It has been found that the ANI fluorophore experiences deamination
reaction in the presence of NO/O2, with the concomitant
fluorescence quenching process. This phenomenon is found to be dependent
on the particular architecture of the studied molecules and their
supramolecular organization. Nonaggregating molecule 1 is the species displaying the highest sensitivity (approx. LOD 0.5
μM) followed by 3 (approx. LOD 2 μM).
Remarkably, in the case of 2, aggregation into large
nanoparticles where the ANI fluorophore is hidden from the aqueous
environment blocks the reactivity toward NO/O2.

These
findings could have implications at two different levels.
On the one hand, they are intended to give experimental support for
the development of new indicators for NO (also for NO2– since they work on the basis of similar mechanisms),
based on monoamines, instead of the frequently used ortho-phenylenediamino approach. This line is especially important if
taking into account that this type of well-known probes can suffer
interferences from DHA and MGO (which is not the case for the monoamine
sensors under the studied conditions). The sensitivity of the molecules
studied here lies within the micromolar range, which could be improved
in future work by activation of the intrinsically electron-deficient
1,8-naphthalimide ring. Although the turn-off behavior is not the
ideal one for a fluorescent probe, it could be used in combination
with another fluorophore, utilizing the Förster resonance energy
transfer mechanisms for ratiometric measurements (work in progress),
same as for other sensors reported in the literature.2,49,54,55 On the other hand, this study aims to raise awareness about the
fact that aggregation of any sensing molecule can have a profound
impact on its sensitivity and hence warns about the possibility of
missing data in bioimaging assays due to the self-assembly of the
probe.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
General Procedure for Coupling
Amino Acid and Amine
A solution of Et3N (2.30
mL, 16.3 mmol, 1 eqiv) in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (40 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of commercially available
carbobenzyloxy-l-amino acid (16.22 mmol) in THF (60 mL) under
N2 flow on an ice bath at 0 °C. To this mixture, an
ice bath-cooled solution of ethyl chloroformate (1.70 mL, 17.7 mmol,
1.1 eqiv) in THF (50 mL) was added dropwise. The reaction was left
at 0 °C for 30 min. Finally, a solution of amine (19.8 mmol,
1.2 eqiv) in THF (50 mL) was added dropwise for 15 min at 0 °C.
The reaction was left for 12 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was poured
into 0.1 M HCl and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min. It was filtered
under vacuum, and the residue was washed with 0.1 M KOH and H2O until pH = 7. The residue was dried under reduced pressure
at 50 °C overnight.

General Procedure for Deprotection of Carbobenzyloxy
Group
Palladium catalyst (10% w/w) was suspended in MeOH
(250 mL) and
stirred under H2 at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently,
a solution of carbobenzyloxy amino compound in MeOH (150 mL) was added
via a syringe, followed by stirring under H2 at room temperature
for 2–4 h. The reaction mixture was then filtered through high-performance
liquid chromatography filters (0.46 μm), and the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure to yield the respective amine.

General
Procedure for Preparing 4-Nitro-1,8-Naphthalimide Derivatives
4-Nitro-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (498.2 mg, 1.94 mmol, 1 eqiv)
was suspended in a closed opaque vial with CH3OH (15 mL)
and vigorous stirring at room temperature. A solution of free amine
compound in CH3OH (15 mL) was added dropwise. The reaction
mixture was heated to 75 °C for 8 h. Solution of the suspension
was observed as the temperature increased, and a voluminous solid
appeared. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was left at room temperature
and the brown solid was filtered through a sintered funnel and washed
with CH3OH several times until a light brown solid was
obtained.

General Procedure for Reduction of NO2 Group
Palladium catalyst (10% w/w) was suspended
in MeOH (50 mL) and stirred
under H2 at room temperature for 10 min. Subsequently,
a suspension of 4-nitro-1,8-naphthalimide derivatives in MeOH (50
mL) was added via a syringe, followed by stirring under H2 at room temperature for 12 h. The solution changes color almost
immediately from a brown suspension to a green/yellow suspension.
The palladium catalyst is removed by filtering with celite. To recover
the entire product, we keep washing with DMSO. The CH3OH
was evaporated, and the DMSO was lyophilized to obtain a pure product.

Procedure for Ester Hydrolysis
Compound 10 (see
ESI, Supporting Information) was
dissolved in THF/H2O mixture (1/1) in presence of 10 eqiv
of LiOH and heated to 60 °C for 6 h. The reaction mixture was
evaporated under vacuum; next, the aqueous mixture was acidified (HCl
1 M) to pH = 1. A red solid were precipitated, filtered, and washed
with distilled water to obtain a pure product.

Materials
Commercial reagents 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-hydrazine
sodium salt (NONOate), NaNO2, and all solvents have been
used as received. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400 and
300 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 126 and 75 MHz
(see ESI, Supporting Information) at 30
°C with TMS as the internal standard. Mass spectra were run in
QTOF electrospray (ESMS) mode.

Fluorescence and UV–Vis
Spectroscopy
Solutions
and suspensions were measured in a JASCO FP-8300 spectrofluorometer
using 3 mL quartz cuvettes with 10 mm path length at 20 °C. For
UV–vis measurements, a JASCO V-630 apparatus was used.

NO Sensing
Procedure for determining the sensitivity
of the synthesized products to NO was carried out by adding different
amounts of concentrated stock solutions of 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide
derivatives in DMSO (1 mM) to H2O/DMSO (9:1) to achieve
a final concentration of 10 μM sensors in aqueous solution.
Freshly prepared stock solutions of NO donor NONOate sodium in water
at pH 8 (stable at this pH) were added to 3 mL of the previous sensor
solution to have different NO concentrations ([NO] = 0, 0.37, 0.74,
1.65, 3.7, 7.5, 18.5, 37.5, 73.5, and 111 μM). Then, 2% acetic
acid was added to trigger the decomposition of the donor and release
of NO (final pH 2.8). The mixtures were left to stabilize for 8 h,
and then the reactivity observed using fluorescence spectroscopy (λexc = 420 nm; λem = 540 nm). Controls were
made to assure that the observed reactivity was due to NO/O2 and not protonation of the amine groups (see the Supporting Information). Also, control assays were made in
the presence of DHA and MGO as potential interfering species (see
the Supporting Information).

Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS)
DLS measurements were
performed with Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS instrument. Three milliliters
of 10 μM solutions or suspensions in aqueous solutions was measured
in 1 cm optical path quartz cuvettes at 25 °C.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Field-emission scanning
electron micrographs were recorded on a JEOL 7001F microscope equipped
with a CCD digital camera. The corresponding dispersions were placed
on top of an aluminum specimen mount stub, fast-freezed with liquid
N2, and lyophilized overnight. The sample was then sputtered
with Pt (Baltec SCD500) for 30 s and observed at 15 kV.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
TEM micrographs were
taken on JEOL 2100 microscope with a thermionic gun LaB6 200 KV equipped with a GatanOrius high-resolution CCD camera. TEM
samples were prepared over Carbon formvar copper grids by putting
drops of suspension and incubating for 5 min. The suspension excess
was removed with filter paper and left overnight in a glass desiccator.

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM)
Experiments
were performed on an inverted confocal microscope Leica TCS SP8. Images
where obtained with an HC PL APO CS2 63×/1.40 OIL immersion objective.
Excitation of samples was performed with diode laser excitation (405
nm) and was observed with a photomultiplier tubes detector. Samples
were straightforwardly prepared by adding 300 μL of dispersions
on sterilized Ibidi μ-Slide 8 Well Glass Bottom: #1.5H (170
± 5 μm) Schott glass.
