The role of the main
dihedral angles in the electronic circular
dichroism (ECD) spectra of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) was estimated
by using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) for oligo(phenylacetylene)s
(n = 12). These studies reveal that in cis–transoidal
arrangements, the first Cotton effect is dominated by excitations
involving molecular orbitals (MOs) mainly related to the polyene backbone.
Hence, for this scaffold, the ± sign of the first Cotton effect
reflects the P/M helical sense of the internal helix of the polymer.
However, in cis–cisoidal arrangements, contribution of MOs
in the polyene and the aryl rings of the PPA backbone produce the
first Cotton effect band. As a result, two different ECD signatures
with three or four alternating Cotton effects can be produced depending
on the sign of the ω1 and ω3 dihedral
angles which determine the helical sense of the polyene (ω1) and the relative orientation of the aryl ring toward the
polyene (ω3), respectively. Thus, on the one hand,
if ω1 and ω3 rotate in opposite
directions, a CD with three alternating Cotton effects is observed,
where the sign of first Cotton correlates with the P/M helical sense
of the polyene. On the other hand, if ω1 and ω3 rotate in the same direction, a CD signature with four alternating
Cotton effects is produced where the information relative to the P/M
helical sense of the polyene is contained in the second Cotton effect.

Introduction
To develop novel functional
materials based on helical polymers,
it is necessary to identify the different parameters involved in polymer
folding. Thus, the elucidation of the secondary structure in some
helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs)1−5 is still a challenge because of the difficulty in obtaining information
about the different helical parameters, that is, helical pitch and
helical sense.6

During the last decade,
great effort has been made combining information
from different structural techniques to finally get a good approximation
of the helical structure adopted by these polymers. However, this
is a difficult task because of the intrinsic properties of the polymers,
where the same fragment is repeated along the polymer chain (monomer
repeating unit) (Figure 1a). Moreover, PPAs form two coaxial helices, one described by the
polyene backbone (internal helix) and the other one described by the
pendants (external helix), which can rotate in the same or opposite
directions depending on the dihedral angle between conjugated double
bonds (Figure 1b).6,7

Figure 1 (a)

Schematic representation of different scaffolds formed by two coaxial
helices rotating in the same and opposite directions. (c) 3D model
of PPAs showing two different scaffolds where the coaxial helices
rotate in the same or opposite direction.

In PPAs, the internal helix is not stabilized by any supramolecular
interaction within the polyene backbone. Thus, the adoption by the
polymer of a certain helical structure responds to the conformational
composition at the pendant groups and to the presence of either supramolecular
or steric interactions among pendants.

Nevertheless, considering
the flexibility of the polyene skeleton,
these interactions may originate many different structures depending
on the dihedral angle between conjugated double bonds (ω1) (Figure 1a). Thus, on the one hand, if this dihedral angle is lower than 90°,
the polymer adopts a cis–cisoidal backbone where the internal
and external helices rotate in the same direction (Figure 1b,c). On the other hand, if
ω1 > 90°, the polymer adopts a cis–transoidal
polyene skeleton where the internal and external helices rotate in
opposite directions (Figure 1b,c).

When this structural variability is combined with
the complications
arisen from the presence of the same repetition fragment—monomer
repeating unit—along the polymer chain, a powerful structural
technique such as nuclear magnetic resonance is almost useless.

Solid-state methods such as X-ray diffraction8−18 or atomic force microscopy (AFM)19−27 can be used to provide the helical pitch, length, and helix width,
although no information about the internal helical sense is obtained.

AFM can give details on the orientation of the external part of
the helix (Figure 2), although high-resolution AFM images are required.19−27 These images are obtained from two-dimensional crystals or self-assembled
monolayers, which cannot always be successfully prepared.27 Therefore, the application of this technique
to the structural analysis of PPAs is limited.

Figure 2 Combination of structural
information obtained from a PPA by different
structural techniques such as AFM, DSC, molecular mechanics, DFT,
ECD, and VCD.

For its part, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) is known
to provide information about the internal helix of the PPA. Thus,
cis–cisoidal (c–c) and cis–transoidal (c–t)
polyene backbones are associated with different and characteristic
thermograms28 (Figure 2).

Unfortunately, these studies are
frequently limited by the poor
definition of the thermograms or by the presence of peaks associated
with conformational changes in the pendants, making the assignments
unreliable.

Recently, we have shown that vibrational circular
dichroism (VCD)
can give important information about the orientation of the external
part of the PPA helix.29 Thus, the solvent
can interact with the pendant groups present at the periphery of the
PPA forming a supramolecular helix with the same orientation than
the external part of the PPA helix. In this way, the VCD sign due
to the solvent bands reflects the orientation of the external part
of the helix (Figure 2) and can be used to determine its sense.

The combination of
experimental methods with theoretical calculations
has also been used to elucidate the secondary structure of some helical
polymers different from PPAs, for instance, through VCD,30−32 electronic circular dichroism (ECD) simulations, and MMFF9433 energy minimization.

ECD is one of the
most important structural techniques in the study
of PPAs. By looking at the ECD spectra of PPAs, it is possible to
determine an excess of a single-handed helix into the polymer because
of the presence of an ECD signature at the vinylic region (Figure 2). However, no helical
parameters can be obtained from these experiments.1−5

Lately, we found that it is possible to determine
the P/M internal
helical sense of a PPA from the ECD spectra. This conclusion is based
on the correlation observed between a series of PPAs with different
and well-known helical scaffolds (Figure 2) and the theoretically calculated time-dependent
density functional theory (TD-DFT) ECD spectra.34 Thus, a positive Cotton effect at the vinylic region corresponds
to a P helical (internal) sense, whereas a negative Cotton effect
indicates the presence of an M helix for the polyene skeleton.

This correlation works fine in the different PPAs tested, whose
secondary structure was obtained from a combination of different structural
techniques.

In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of this
ECD trace/internal
helical sense relationship, analyzing how variations in the main dihedral
angles—ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4—of the PPAs can affect their
ECD spectra, and therefore the reliability of the helical sense assignment
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 Main dihedral
angles of a PPA.

Results and Discussion
The helical structure adopted by a PPA is mainly dependent on the
values adopted by the C=C–C=C (ω1) and the C–C=C–C (ω2) dihedral
angles. All the polymers mentioned in this study (prepared with Rh(I)
as the catalyst) have a cis configuration of the double bonds, and
therefore, a value ω2 = 0° was introduced in
all the three-dimensional (3D) models along this work.

Before
studying the effect of rotations around ω1, ω3, and ω4 on the PPA ECD spectra,
we checked the minimum size of an oligo(phenylacetylene) [number of
monomer repeating units (n)] required to reach convergence
in the ECD shape and therefore for the computational study to reproduce
the experimental ECD spectra.

From previous studies, we know
that a PPA can adopt two main different
scaffolds attending to the value adopted by ω1. Thus,
on the one hand, if ω1 < 90°, the polyene
adopts a compressed cis–cisoidal helical scaffold with three
residues per helical turn (Figure 1c), and with the internal and the external helices
rotating in the same direction. On the other hand, if ω1 > 90°, the polymer adopts a stretched helical structure,
with two residues per turn and with the internal and external helices
rotating in opposite directions (Figure 1c).

Considering the above, a series
of oligomers was built by varying
the number of monomer repeating units (n) in the
two different polyene skeletons, that is, cis–cisoidal and
cis–transoidal. The dihedral angles used to build the two different
scaffolds were obtained from previous experimental and theoretical
studies.6,34

In this way, the series of oligomers
with cis–cisoidal n + 3 arrangements was built
with ω1 =
60°, ω3 = −36°, and n = 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 monomers (Figure 4b), whereas for the cis–transoidal n + 2 oligomers, we selected ω1 = 165°,
ω3 = 80°, and n = 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 units (Figure 4c).

No substituents were introduced on the phenyl ring of the
PPAs,
and therefore, ω4 is irrelevant in these calculations.

TD-DFT CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* ECD calculations35−40 produce theoretical spectra in oligomers with n ≤ 6 that do not follow the typical ECD signature of a helical
structure with three alternating positive and negative Cotton effects.
A good convergence between experimental and theoretically calculated
ECD spectra requires the presence of at least nine residues in the
oligomer chain (n = 9) (Figure 4b,c). Thus, in the case of cis–cisoidal
oligomers (Figure 4b), the calculated ECD spectrum with n = 6 does
not fit the experimental ECD spectrum, but from n = 9 and above, the stationary points are in agreement in wavelength
and in intensity with an experimental cis–cisoidal ECD spectrum.
In PPAs with a cis–transoidal disposition (Figure 2a), convergence in the lambda
region of 330 nm is reached already at n = 8, although
for convergence of the full ECD spectrum, n ≥
10 is necessary (Figure 4c).

Taking these results into account, we selected for the
theoretical
ECD studies oligomers with n = 12, as good representatives
of both n + 2 and the n + 3 scaffolds.

Next, we studied how variations in ω1 and ω3 (ω2 = 0° in cis polymers) can affect
the ECD signature of a PPA.

Thus, ECD spectra were evaluated
for cis–cisoidal 12-mer
oligophenylacetylenes with ω1 = 60°, 70°,
and 80°. Similar calculations were also carried out onto 12-mer
cis–transoidal oligo(phenylacetylene)s with ω1 = 155°, 165°, and 175°. All the studies were performed
for positive values of ω1, which produced a P internal
helix. ω2 was fixed in all cases at 0°, in accordance
with the cis configuration of the double bond.

Variations on
ω3 were introduced as negative values
(from 0° to −90°) because most of the reported right-handed
cis–cisoidal and cis–transoidal helices present a negative
value for this dihedral angle. In addition, modeling showed us that
negative ω3 angles give the best fits for the right-handed
cis–cisoidal and cis–transoidal polyene skeletons.

In some special cases, ω3 could be introduced
with a positive value, being this feasible just when ω1 is close to 90° (i.e. ω1 = 80°, Figure 5c), otherwise too
unstable high-energy conformations result. In a similar manner, geometries
with ω3 = 30° or larger were not considered
because of their high energies.

FWHM equals to 0.276 eV.

Finally, the absence of substituents on the phenyl ring of
these
oligo(phenylacetylene)s makes ω4 irrelevant.

Next, we examined how variations in ω3 values
can affect the calculated ECD for several cis–cisoidal structures
(ω1 < 90°) (Figure 5).

On the one hand, it was found that
in those cases where ω1 and ω3 have
opposite signs—ω1 > 0° and ω3 < 0°—, the
ECD trace shows two Cotton effect bands, the first positive and the
second negative. More precisely, if ω1 = 60°
and ω3 = −15°, −30°, −50°,
−60°, and −70°, a first positive Cotton effect
appears at around 270 nm, whereas a second negative Cotton band is
distinguished at 230 nm (Figure 5a). On the other hand, in those oligomers with ω1 = 70° and ω3 = −15°, −30°,
−50°, −60°, and −70°, the two
Cotton effect bands appear shifted toward lower wavelengths: the first
positive band at 240 nm and the second negative at 220 nm (Figure 5b). The same effect
is observed in cis–cisoidal structures with ω1 = 80° and ω3 = −50°, −60°,
and −70°, now showing the first, positive, Cotton band
at 220 nm and the second, negative, at 210 nm (Figure 5c).

Thus, increases in the ω1 angle shift the two
Cotton bands toward lower wavelengths, as could be expected from a
lower conjugation among the double bonds.

In order to unambiguously
determine which one of the dihedral angles,
ω1 and/or ω3, is associated with
the first positive Cotton effect, the molecular orbitals (MOs) obtained
from the theoretical calculations were analyzed. Thus, we can determine
which MOs contribute most to the excitations responsible of the first
Cotton effect.

In the structures where ω1 and
ω3 have opposite signs—ω1 > 0° and ω3 < 0°—, the calculations
showed that the main
excitations contributing to the first Cotton effect are due to MOs
on the phenyl ring and on the polyene backbone. These excitations
are closely related to ω1 and ω3, which induce in both cases a positive Cotton effect. Therefore,
this first positive Cotton effect can be correlated with a right-handed
orientation for the polyene backbone (Figure 6a and Supporting Information).

Figure 6 MOs responsible for the first Cotton effect in two different calculated
oligo(phenylacetylene)s. (a) cis–cisoidal PPA ω1 = 80° and ω3 = −70°. (b) cis–cisoidal
PPA ω1 = 80° and ω3 = 30°.
FWHM equals to 0.276 eV.

Interestingly, when ω3 is zero (ω1 = 60°, 70°, and 80°), or when ω1 and ω3 have the same positive sign—ω1 = 80°/ω3 = 15° and 30°—,
an extra Cotton effect appears at higher wavelengths—around
330 nm for ω1 = 60° (Figure 5a), 260 nm for ω1 = 70°
(Figure 5b), and 250–260
nm for ω1 = 80° (Figure 5c)—, whereas the other two Cotton
effects remain either unaffected (ω1 = 60° and
70°, Figure 5a,b)
or converge into a single positive Cotton effect at around 230 nm
(Figure 5c).

Analysis of the MOs involved in these theoretical ECD spectra shows
that when ω1 > 0 and ω3 >
0, the
MOs on the phenyl ring and on the polyene backbone do not contribute
to the first Cotton effect in the same manner as shown for cis–cisoidal
PPAs with opposite signs for ω1 and ω3 (Figure 6 and Supporting Information).

Transitions among
these MOs generate now two different Cotton effects
with opposite signs, as the excitations involved in the first Cotton
effect in the case of opposite ω1 and ω3 signs are now divided into two different Cotton effects (Figure 5). The second Cotton
effect resonates at the same frequency than the first Cotton effect
in polymers where ω1 and ω3 have
opposite signs. This Cotton effect is positive in both cases and seems
to indicate a right-handed helix for the polyene backbone. The new
first Cotton effect appears at higher wavelengths and has opposite
sign.

Thus, from these studies, we found that in cis–cisoidal
PPAs, the first Cotton effect seems to be directly associated with
a right- or left-handed orientation of the polyene scaffold (ω1). In those special cases where ω1 and ω3 have equal signs or ω3 = 0°, an extra
Cotton effect should appear, shifted toward larger wavelengths, and
to determine the internal helical sense of the polymer, it is necessary
to take into account the sign of the second Cotton effect.

Next,
we carried out the same study on the cis–transoidal
oligomer skeletons (ω1 > 90°). In this backbone,
ω3 and ω1 have to be introduced
with opposite signs. Otherwise, very constrained helical structures
are generated, which are not worthwhile considering.

Thus, ECD
calculations on cis–transoidal n = 12 oligomers
with ω1 = 155°, 165°,
and 175° and ω3 varying from −30°
to −90° showed in all cases a first positive Cotton effect,
which resonates at different wavelengths because of the different
conjugation of double bonds (Figure 7). During these studies, we found that although modulation
of ω3 produces some changes in the overall ECD spectra,
the first Cotton effect remains positive in all cases (Figure 7).

(d) MOs involved in the sign of the first Cotton effect. FWHM equals
to 0.276 eV.

This first Cotton effect
is due to contributions from MOs on the
polyene skeleton (ω1) (Figure 7d), and therefore, in cis–transoidal
PPAs, there is a correlation between the sign of the first Cotton
effect and the helical sense of the internal helix—ECD-positive/P
helix and ECD-negative/M helix.

Finally, in order to get a more
complete vision on the structural
factors influencing the ECD of a PPA, we decided to check what could
be the contribution to the ECD trace of a substituent on the phenyl
ring.

Many PPAs with amide function on the phenyl ring have
been prepared
and have their ECDs reported in the literature. Therefore, we decided
to study the influence on the ECD of ω4 rotations
on para-formamido PPA oligomers (Figure 8a). More precisely, we built para-formamido oligo(phenylacetylene)s n = 12, with two different cis–cisoidal backbones—ω1 = 60°, ω3 = −60°, and ω1 = 70°, ω3 = −30°—and
with one cis–transoidal—ω1 = 165°,
ω3 = −75° (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 TD-DFT CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* ECD spectra of a 12-mer
oligophenylacetylene
with different cis–cisoidal (a) ω1 = 60°,
ω3 = −60°, (b) ω1 =
70°, ω3 = −30° and cis–transoidal
(c) ω1 = 165°, ω3 = −75°
showing different ω4 values. FWHM equals to 0.276
eV.

The ECD was calculated considering
that the amide group can adopt
different orientations depending on the ω4 that was
introduced in a range from 10° to 135°. As a result, we
observed that changing ω4, in both cis–cisoidal
and cis–transoidal para-formamido oligophenylacetylenes,
does not affect the sign of the first Cotton band that remains positive
for all rotamers. Therefore, in amide-substituted PPAs, the correlation
between the sign of the first Cotton band and the helical sense of
the internal helix—positive first Cotton effect/P helix—conserves
its predictive value. Only the bands at lower wavelengths of the ECD
spectra are affected by this dihedral angle (ω4).

Thus, from these studies, we can assert that ω1 and ω3 are the dihedral angles involved in the
formation of the first Cotton effect of a PPA ECD trace. Thus, by
looking at its sign—positive or negative—it is possible
to determine the helical sense of the PPA, although first it is necessary
to discriminate between those polymers that present an ECD trace with
three or four alternating Cotton effects.

In the literature,
we found that the most frequent situation is
a PPA presenting an ECD trace with three alternating Cotton effects.6,7,27,29,34 In this case, correlation between the sign
of the first Cotton band and the helical sense of the internal helix
is direct—positive first Cotton effect/P helix or negative
first Cotton effect/M helix. Sometimes, PPAs show four alternating
Cotton effects in their ECD trace, which makes the helical sense assignment
difficult. Herein, we could identify the position—first Cotton
effect—and the dihedral angle responsible of this extra band—ω3. Therefore, in this case, the first Cotton effect does not
provide information about the internal helical sense of the polymer.
In such cases, the second Cotton effect is the one related to ω1 and to the internal helical sense of the PPA—positive
second Cotton effect/P helix or negative second Cotton effect/M helix.

Additionally, in the literature, it is possible to find examples
where a cis–cisoidal or cis–transoidal PPA can show
an ECD with three or four alternating Cotton effects depending on
the solvent used to dissolve the polymer. For instance, a PPA bearing
as pendant the Mosher reagent linked as amide on the phenyl ring shows
a typical ECD signature, with three alternating positive/negative/positive
(or vice versa) Cotton effects when dissolved in chloroform, while
an extra band at higher wavelength is observed in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) or dimethylformamide (for the ECD in THF see Figure 9a).3 In this case, the second Cotton effect at around 380 nm is the one
that indicates the helical sense of the internal helix.7 A similar situation is found in PPAs bearing
amino acid groups as pendants41 (Figure 9b).

examples of PPAs showing an extra Cotton
effect associated with the relative orientation of the ω1/ω3 dihedral angles. (d) Prediction of the
M or P helical sense based on the sign of the first Cotton effect
for both cis–cisoidal and cis–transoidal PPAs whose
ECDs show three Cotton effects. (e) Prediction of the M or P helical
sense based on the sign of the second Cotton effect for both cis–cisoidal
and cis–transoidal PPAs whose ECDs show four Cotton effects.

Interestingly, we found another
example that reports how changes
in temperature rotate the ω3 angle producing an inversion
of the extra band, while the rest of the ECD spectrum, and therefore
the internal helical sense of the PPA, remains unaltered (Figure 9c) (Pint, ECD (+) at 380 nm).42

Overall, this extra band serves to illustrate how the action of
external stimuli (changes in polarity/donor ability of the solvent
or in temperature) could affect the rotation involved in ω3 that is reflected in the ECD spectrum.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, TD-DFT calculations for different cis–cisoidal
and cis–transoidal oligo(phenylacetylene)s allowed us to demonstrate
how the main dihedral angles of a PPA contribute to the different
Cotton effects of its ECD spectrum.

Thus, in cis–cisoidal
PPAs, the first Cotton effect is produced
by excitations involving MOs placed both at the polyene and at the
phenyl rings. As a result, two different ECD spectra can be obtained:1. A typical
helical ECD pattern with
three alternating Cotton effects—positive/negative/positive
or vice versa. In this case, the first Cotton indicates the helical
sense of the polyene—that is, ECD-positive/P helix; ECD-negative/M
helix (Figure 9d).

2. An ECD signature with four
alternating
Cotton effects. In this case, the first and second Cotton effects
are produced by transitions involving MOs on the polyene and on the
phenyl rings, being possible to extract the helical sense of the internal
helix by using the sign of the second Cotton effect—that is,
ECD-positive/P helix; ECD-negative/M helix. The new first Cotton effect
contains information about the ω1/ω3 relationship and has no value for helical sense determination (Figure 9e).



Regarding cis–transoidal PPAs, there is a helical
ECD pattern
with three alternating Cotton effects. The first Cotton effect of
the ECD spectra is mainly generated by contributions of MOs located
on the polyene backbone and can be positive or negative depending
on the helical sense described by ω1. Therefore,
there is a correlation between the sign of the first Cotton effect
and the P/M helical sense described by the internal helix—that
is, ECD-positive/P helix; ECD-negative/M helix. Experimentally, we
found that, in some cis–transoidal PPAs, an uncommon ECD trace
with four alternating Cotton effects is observed, and in that case—similarly
to cis–cisoidal PPAs—the second Cotton effect is the
one that contains the information of the internal helix.

Our
results were experimentally validated using PPA ECD spectra
reported in the literature, where an extra Cotton effect can be observed
depending on the solvent used to dissolve the polymer, or even where
an inversion of this extra Cotton effect can be produced by temperature
changes without affecting the helical sense of the PPA.7,41

Thus, this is the first time that a PPA ECD signature is broken
down, analyzing how the main dihedral angles contribute to the final
ECD spectrum, and therefore making it possible to determine the polymer
helical sense, in both cis–cisoidal and cis–transoidal
arrangements, depending on the sign of the first or second Cotton
effect in an ECD trace with three or four alternating Cotton effects,
respectively.

Computational Details
To obtain
the ECD spectra using computational chemistry, scalar
rotational strengths have to be evaluated. For a transition from the
ground state of the molecule (0) to an excited state (n), the scalar rotational strength can be calculated from the residue
of the linear response function corresponding to the electric dipole–magnetic
dipole polarizability tensor (R0nLG). In the length-gauge
(LG) formalism, the residue is given by eq 1: 1  where ω0n is the frequency of the transition between
the 0
and the n state, μα is the
α component of the electric dipole moment, and mα is the α component of the magnetic dipole
moment of the molecule.35

The theoretical
ECD spectra are calculated using TD-DFT35,36 in combination
with the CAM-B3LYP37,38 density functional
and the 6-31G* basis set.39 The calculations
were carried out with the ORCA program and 80 excitation energies
were evaluated.40

The TD-DFT CAM-B3LYP/6-31G*
ECD plots are built from the calculated
rotational strengths using a Gaussian band shape and FWHM corrected
to reproduce the shape of the experimental PPA spectra.
