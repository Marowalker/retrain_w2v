Removal of chloride from Cp*Ir(glycinato)Cl in noncoordinating
solvents with Ag[PF6] or Tl[PF6] leads to the
formation of a closed octametallic loop of cations. The same loop
also sequesters a number of PF6– counter
anions. This is in contrast with reports that piano-stool complexes
with amino acids form only trimetallic [Cp*Ir(aminoacidato)]33+ moieties upon creating the cation. Cp*Ir(glycinato)Cl
also forms a trimetallic compound as well as a octametallic compound,
and the octametallic vs trimetallic formation appears to be dependent
on the anion. The synthesis and characterization of the octametallic
complex, as well as some monometallic and trimetallic compounds, are
reported, including the X-ray crystal structures.

1 Introduction
There is a very rich chemistry
of transition metals with amino
acid ligands.1−4 Within that large group, piano-stool complexes, especially of osmium,
ruthenium, rhodium, and iridium, with amino acid ligands show a particular
aptitude for self-assembly into polynuclear complexes. In the former
two cases (Ru and Os), the “seat” of the piano stool
is usually a neutral benzenoid ligand such as benzene, mesitylene,
hexamethylbenzene or a host of other substituted benzenes.5−7 For the latter two cases (Rh and Ir), the aromatic π ligand
is most usually cyclopentadienide or a plethora of continually evolving
substituted cyclopentadienides.8−12 In both cases, with the anion of the amino acid, a neutral piano-stool
complex of ruthenium(II), osmium(II), rhodium(III), and iridium(III)
is formed with the third leg of the piano stool being a negatively
charged ligand such as a halide or a pseudohalide. A halide can be
removed using silver tetrafluoroborate, silver hexafluorophosphate,
or a silver (or thallium) salt of other weakly coordinating anions.
In a coordinating solvent, that solvent can replace the halide ion.
In a noncoordinating solvent, there are several examples where a halide
removal reaction leads to self-assembly yielding trinuclear piano-stool
compounds. The assembly involves the amino acid moieties wherein the
carboxylate of the amino acid bridges the metal centers.

In
2008, Alessio et al. wrote a detailed review of tri- and tetrametallic
compounds formed from suitably bridging ligands and the bridge is
not limited to amino acids by any means, but they do dominate. Whatever
the potential linking ligand, the dominant motif appears to be the
formation of what Alessio called “metallatriangles”.13 Beck et al. showed that a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl
(Cp*) complex of Rh and phenylalanine can be induced to form metallotriangles
by chloride removal with silver BF4.14 Carmona et al. reported the synthesis of four such trinuclear
species beginning with (p-cymene)Os(amino acid)Cl
complexes and silver tetrafluoroborate.15 Many other types of bridging ligands have been used to create shapes
such as metallarectangles16 and other tetra-,
hexa-, and dodecanuclear Ir compounds.17 A recent review by Milios et al. focuses on the chemistry specifically
for amino acids.18 For piano-stool complexes
of Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir, the trimetallic complexes with bridging amino
acid ligands dominate.

In this paper, we report our findings
in the area pioneered by
Carmona and Beck, among others, that the formation of polymetallic
compounds with bridging amino acids occurs on replacing a halide ligand
with a poorly coordinating anion. For this specific area of amino
acid half-sandwich compounds, the literature is relatively emphatic
that only trinuclear compounds are formed. We here show that the nuclearity
is not only limited to trinuclear species but also can form other
species depending on the amino acid and the counterion. An unprecedented
octametallic complex is described. We have been examining, in some
detail, the bis acidato amine complexes of palladium as well as the
acidato amine piano-stool complexes of Cp*RM where M =
Rh, Ir, and Cp*R refers to tetramethyl cyclopentadienide
compounds where the 5th position is a group other than methyl.19 We have published on the syntheses of many Cp*RIr and Rh compounds previously.20−23

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Monometallic Complexes
2.1.1 Neutral Piano-Stool Compounds
The
addition of amino acids to [Cp*RIrCl2]2 yields piano-stool complexes of the form Cp*RM(aa)Cl
(aa = amino acidato) complexes. In general, the most studied amino
acid and the one that yields the most interesting catalytic asymmetric
transformations is proline. We have reported previously on the combinations
of Cp*R and azetidine, proline and pipecolic acid to yield asymmetric
transfer hydrogenation (ATH) catalysts.19 This paper will focus on Cp* only and on glycine and proline solely
for the purpose of examining the self-assembly of cations formed upon
chloride removal.

Addition of two equivalents of l-proline
to [Cp*RIrCl2]2 affords an excellent
yield of Cp*Ir(l-prolinato)Cl, complex 1. Characterization
by NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), C,
H analysis, and X-ray crystallography all confirm the composition.
We have already reported on a number of Cp*R iridium amino
acid complexes,19 and the crystal structure
of complex 1 has been reported by Carmona et al.10 There is a distinction to be made here concerning
the diastereomers found in the solid state compared with what occurs
in solution. We obtained a crystal structure of complex 1 to confirm it is the same as reported by Carmona as well as to have
a low-temperature structure for a more direct comparison to our other
compounds. For the figure and the experimental data for compound 1, please see the Supporting information. The solution behavior of 1 is worth noting. When Cp*Ir(l-Pro)Cl from the reaction mixture is dissolved in CDCl3 and the 1H NMR spectrum obtained, there are signals
for two isomers, presumably arising from the two diastereomers. In
the single crystal, the ratio of the diastereomers is 50:50, but in
solution, it is 92:8. A crystal was screened by X-ray diffraction
to confirm that it was the same as that used to determine the single-crystal
X-ray structure. That single crystal (with the 50:50 diastereomer
ratio) was dissolved in CDCl3, and the 1H NMR
spectrum shows that epimerization at the metal center is rapid, obtaining
the same solution ratio as the bulk sample in a matter of seconds.
Monitoring of the 1H NMR spectrum over a period of several
days shows no change in this ratio suggesting that this is the thermodynamic
ratio of the two diastereomers. NOE experiments showed that, in solution,
the major isomer is the one with the S configuration at the metal.

To probe this ratio further, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
using the WebMO interface24 to Gaussian
0925 at the B3LYP level of theory26,27 using the lanl2dz basis set28 were carried
out on the two diastereomers. The two diastereomers showed a ΔG
difference of 15 kJ/mol in favor of the S configuration at the metal
when using l-proline. This magnitude of ΔG suggests
an equilibrium in favor of the S configuration at the metal with a
S/R ratio of approximately 97/3. The actual solution ratio of 92/8
is in good agreement given that there is a solvent effect on this
ratio that is not accounted for in the DFT experiments. The diastereomeric
ratio is also consistent with what has been reported by others.7

The addition of 2 equivalents of glycine
and base to [Cp*Ir(Cl)2]2 produces complex 2, Cp*Ir(glycinato)Cl,
in good yield. Complex 2 has been synthesized previously
and our characterization matches that from the literature, including
the single-crystal X-ray structure.29 Glycine
is not a chiral amino acid; however, the presence of 4 different groups
around the pseudo-tetrahedral iridium atom makes the iridium a chiral
center. As is expected for enantiomers, both display identical NMR
spectra, and both enantiomers are seen in the X-ray crystal structure
(as well as a molecule of dichloromethane (DCM) of solvation). Again,
we obtained the X-ray data for both to confirm the same structure
as previously reported and to have low-temperature data (See the Supporting information).

2.1.2 Cationic Piano-Stool Compounds
Removal of a chloride ion from Cp*M(aa)Cl using a silver salt with
a noncoordinating counterion works quite well with iridium piano-stool
compounds to generate a cationic species. In the presence of a coordinating
solvent, that solvent often will take the place of the lost chloride
ion generating [Cp*Ir(aa)S]+ species (S = solvent). When
Cp*Ir(glycinato)Cl was treated with AgBF4 in acetonitrile,
the cation [Cp*Ir(glycinato)(acetonitrile)]+, complex 3, was formed. This salt was isolated and characterized by
NMR spectroscopies, HRMS, and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
The thermal ellipsoid plot of complex 3 is shown in Figure 1. Limbach et al.
reported this cation as a triflate salt.11 We obtained the crystal structure of 3 to confirm that
the same trimetallic cluster was formed with different anions. The
crystals of the BF4– salt described here
are somewhat twinned and consist of a portion of both enantiomers.
Refinement with the TWIN law in SHELX of -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1 converged
to a value of 0.28 for the Flack parameter indicating a 72/28 ratio
of the enantiomers.

2.2 Polymetallic Complexes
Carmona et al. showed that removal of chloride with AgBF4 from Cp*Ir(l-alaninato)Cl in methanol would yield a trimetallic,
tricationic compound as the BF4– salt
with R-configuration at iridium. The cation generated from Cp*Ir(l-alaninato)Cl has been isolated and structurally characterized
by perchlorate30 and triflate14 counterions. While inclusion of solvent or the
anion may differ, all cations show the same trinuclear arrangement
with l-proline yielding the R-configuration at the metal.
We used AgPF6 to generate the cation and, while the structure
has the disorder of the Cp* rings, it shows the same features: space
group P63 and a trimetallic cluster with
metal centers bridged by the carboxylate of the amine acidato group.
The same motif holds true with other chiral amino acid cations such
as valine. While we have formed several amino acid trimetallic clusters
of Cp*Ir, only one, that of proline, yielded crystals suitable for
X-ray diffraction (Figure 2).

atoms
and Cp* methyl carbons eliminated for clarity. Only one part of the
disordered Cp is shown. Ellipsoids are shown at 50% probability.

When the nonchiral amino acid, glycine, is the
ligand on the piano-stool
compound, we find the same result of trimer formation when the halide
reacts with AgBF4. The BF4– salt crystallizes from N,N-dimethylformamide/hexanes
in P1̅ with the crystal lattice retaining four molecules of
DMF and 0.5 molecules of cyclohexane (we assume that this was a small
component of the hexanes mixture) per trimetallic unit. The geometry
about each metal center is R, R, R (the glycine trimetallic cation
has been reported previously by Limbach et al. with a triflate counterion.
The trimetallic core appears to be the same with both BF4– and triflate (Figure 3).11)

Ellipsoids are shown at 50% probability.

However, when Cp*Ir(glycinato)Cl was treated with
TlPF6, a new and unprecedented octametallic cluster was
formed, and the
core of the cluster is shown in Figure 4. The octamer is formed with semialternating chiral
units of the form RIrRIrSIrSIrRIrRIrSIrSIr.
The asymmetric unit contains only half of the structure, with the
octamer completed through a C2 rotation. The Ir–O
bond strengths differ slightly, even between enantiomers of the same
configuration (see Table 1 for comparison of selected bond distances and angles of the
different enantiomers of the monometallic glycine complex, compound
2, and the four unique metal centers of the octametallic complex,
compound 5. Also, see 4 for the numbering of
the iridium units.) Units 1 and 4, both RIr have Ir–O
bond lengths of 2.134(6) and 2.126(5) Å. Similarly, units 2 and
3 have lengths of 2.140(6) and 2.119(4) Å. Gly1 and Gly2 refer
to the independent units in the monomeric Cp*RIr(Gly)Cl (compound
1). In general, the Ir–O distances are shorter in the monomeric
complexes vs the octameric complex. The differences in bond lengths
and angles are brought on by the constraints imparted by the ring
system formed. In addition to the number of units in the structure,
there are interesting features in the bonding. As can be seen in Figure 4, there are strong
hydrogen-bonding interactions between one of the glycine N–H
atoms and a nonbridging oxygen of an adjacent molecule. There are
only 4 such N–H–O interactions around the torus, but
there are other N–H hydrogen bond donor interactions with PF6– ions (as well as C–H–F interactions).
The combination of these interactions gives an overall shape of a
“crushed” or “bent” torus. A space-filling
model of this shape viewed down what is a C2 axis for the
whole cluster can be found in Figure 5 and a side view in Figure 6. Both Figure 5 and especially Figure 6 show the large hole in the torus of the assembled
cations.

The only difference between the formation of the trimetallic
glycinato
cluster complex 5 and the octametallic cluster 6 is the counteranion: BF4– vs
PF6–. A closer view of both the anions
and cations in the crystal lattice of [Cp*Ir(glycinato)]8[PF6]8 shows that the PF6– appears to play a critical role in the formation of the overall
structure. Again, the structure of the assembled cations is a crushed
torus with a C2 axis and two pockets on either side of
the octametallic complex. In each of those pockets, two PF6– ions sit, and the combination of the octametallic
octacation and four of the PF6– counterions
makes a solid molecular sphere (see Figures 7 and 8). When viewed
at full van der Waals radii, the two PF6– ions in each pocket are held very closely together. The four additional
PF6– ions needed for neutrality are hydrogen-bonded
to the “outside” of the molecular ball.

[Cp*Ir(glycinato)]88+ viewed along the C2 axis showing inclusion of two of
the PF6– counterions in a pocket of the
torus. Atom radii are shown at full van der Waals’ values.

Figure 8 Space-filling plot of [Cp*Ir(glycinato)]88+ viewed from the side showing inclusion of PF6– ions in a pocket of the torus. Atom radii are
shown at full van
der Waals’ values.

A calculation of close contacts (sum of VDW radii)
between the
PF6– and the backbone of the octamer
reveals over 15 close contacts between the PF6– and N–H, C–H, and a number of other sites surrounding
the pocket in which the PF6– ion is held.
Examining stronger, closer contacts based on the sum of the VDW radii
minus 0.2 Å shows that there are 6 particularly close (and presumably
stronger) contacts for each PF6– ion:
one NH···F contact of 2.439 Å, two C–H···F
interactions of 2.46 Å to Cp* methyl groups, one C–H···F
contact of 2.387 Å to a glycine C–H bond, and one C···F
contact between a fluorine and the carboxylato carbon atom of a glycine
ligand. With the exception of the NH···F hydrogen bond,
none of the remaining interactions is what one would normally expect
to be good anion binders, see Figure 9.

Figure 9 View of two of the encapsulated PF6– ions with short contacts indicated by blue dashed lines. The contact
distances are shown in green and both PF6– ions have the same distances since they are related by symmetry.

The way in which the PF6– ions are
cradled in the octametallic complex is unique. As we (BF4–) and Rominger (triflate) have shown, both BF4– and triflate only form trimetallic compounds. Figure 10 depicts a space-filling
plot of the glycine trimetallic, which clearly shows that there is
no “hole” in the center of the trimetallic and while
there are close contacts between the anions and the trimetallic, they
are not “encapsulated” in the cation. So, we conclude
that the interactions with PF6– are what
drives the formation of the octametallic cation. Yu et al. reported
triflate- and nitrate-induced self-assembly of ruthenium half-sandwich
compounds of substituted 8-hydroxyquinoline ligands.31 The phenomenon of anions inducing a particular supramolecular
structure is known in other systems. Several reviews have been written
about the influence of anions on supramolecular complexes, but the
anion most often influences with π–anion interactions
with other triggers causing a fully enclosed cavity to enclose the
anion.32−34 Multiple reviews of piano-stool complexes especially
with amino-acid-type ligands with both Cp and arene ligands show that
the trimetallic is formed no matter the anion.13 The octametallic reported herein clearly shows a new mode
of anion influence not seen before.

with the BF4– anions showing close contacts.

3 Conclusions
Investigations into the
properties of piano-stool complexes of
iridium and amino acids continue to unearth new discoveries of the
bonding and self-assembly features of these moieties. We have created
a significant library of Cp*R with R ranging from H to
linear alkyls with lengths as high as 12, branched alkyls, aryls,
and aralkyl. The combinatorial possibilities for how the R group,
the metal (Rh and Ir), and the amino acid affect the self-assembly
are a continuing interest, but at the time of submitting this publication,
many different combinations have been tried with no success. In this
paper, we demonstrate that proline, as is the case with many reports
of other amino acid complexes of Cp*Ir compounds, shows trimetallic
cluster formation even with PF6– counterions
but glycine shows a quite different behavior of forming the unique
octametallic assembly. Future combinations will be investigated.

4.2 Syntheses
General procedure: An appropriately
sized round-bottom flask was charged with required amounts of [Cp*IrCl2]2, amino acid, base (KOH or NaHCO3),
and methanol. With magnetic stirring, the initial orange solution
changed to yellow over the course of 30 min to 2 h depending on the
amino acid used. The solvent was removed via reduced pressure. The
complex was extracted with 3 × 10 mL of dichloromethane (DCM)
and filtered to remove excess amino acid and base. The complexes were
recrystallized by first dissolving the complexes in minimal DCM, followed
by slow addition of either ether or hexanes to produce a yellow powder.
The complexes were then collected on a frit as yellow crystalline
powders.
