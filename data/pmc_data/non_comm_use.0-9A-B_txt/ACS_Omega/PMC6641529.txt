This article presents a magnetically
actuated two-way, three-position
(+, 0, −), paper-based microfluidic valve that includes a neutral
position (0)—the first of its kind. The system is highly robust,
customizable, and fully automated. The advent of a neutral position
and the ability to precisely control switching frequencies establish
a new platform for highly controlled fluid flows in paper-based wicking
microfluidic devices. The potential utility of these valves is demonstrated
in automated, programmed, patterning of dyed liquids in a wicking
device akin to a colorimetric assay but with a programmed fluid/reagent
delivery. These valves are fabricated using facile methods and thus
remain cost-effective for adoption into affordable point-of-care/bioanalytical
devices.

Introduction
Affordable microfluidics
has recently garnered renewed interest,
in part, because of the emergence of pump-free, capillary wicking-based
point-of-care (PoC)/bioanalytical devices. These devices allow users
to perform chemical and biochemical sensing beyond what is currently
available in most laboratory environments. PoC devices need to be
low cost and deliver rapid results and be simple to use even by unskilled
personnel, irrespective of the setting.1,2 Although pump-free
and wicking-based analytical devices (e.g., pregnancy tests) have
been used for a long time, a resurgence in interest has occurred following
the introduction of microfluidic paper analytical devices (μPADS)
in 2007.3 μPADS offer simple, disposable,
and affordable analytical devices for bioassays and environmental
analysis.4−12 These μPADS have numerous advantages over classical microfluidics:
(i) porosity-induced capillary action eliminates the need for external
pumps, (ii) μPADS are biocompatible for various applications
including clinical diagnosis, food quality control, and environmental
monitoring, and13 (iii) μPADS and
paper microfluidics are built upon established technologies such as
lateral flow tests.

A downside to this promising technology
is the reproducibility
of the active elements used in conventional open-channel microfluidic
applications—assuring a robust fluid control, such as valves
and switches. This challenge has led to an intense search for methods
to control fluidic flows on wicking-based devices. Recently, efforts
to fabricate paper-based valves to switch fluid flows on and/or off
in channels have been reported. These valves fall into two main categories:
(i) wetting-based gating, where the wettability of the barrier changes
in the presence of a stimulus or (ii) controlling the contact between
two wicking channels. One approach is based on hydrophobic and hydrophilic
electrodes that close and open a fluidic channel when a voltage is
applied. In the valve concept presented by Koo et al. in 2013,14 the fluid flows past a hydrophilic electrode
and stops at the hydrophobic electrode (Figure 1a(i)). When a voltage is applied, the hydrophobic
layer is destroyed and fluid flow is triggered. A similar valve based
on melting wax has also been developed.15 Electrowetting or thermal gating valves are destructive and are
one-way single-use (actuation can only be performed once) devices.16,17 Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the applied voltages/heat
or degraded chemicals will not affect the analyte or the fluidic properties.
As an alternative, Chen et al.18 exploited
the biphilic nature of surfactants to invert the wettability of a
nonwetting gate allowing fluid flow. The valve consists of a disk
(trigger) and an open ring surrounding the trigger as a gate, both
separated by a hydrophobic gap (Figure 1a(ii)). A trigger fluid (orange) loaded with surfactants
helps overcome the hydrophobic gate allowing an aqueous fluid flow.
The dissolved surfactant molecules raise the surface tension of the
hydrophobic barrier, releasing the gated fluid (blue). This approach,
however, introduces the surfactant into the test fluid, increasing
the flow and test complexity. Houghtaling et al.19 reported a soluble bridge-type valve, where a short piece
of the μPAD can be dissolved, opening the valve.

Figure 1 (a) Approaches for unidirectional
valves. These methods are generally
irreversible and difficult to control. (b) Controlled and reversible
valves using magnetomechanical actuation.

The main class of paper fluidic valves, however, is mechanically
triggered valves in which the contact between two channels is controlled.
Toley et al. recently reported an actuation-based valve using paper
strips and fluid-triggered expanding elements (swelling sponge) to
push two channels into contact (Figure 1a(iii)).20 A similar two-way
valve, based on a fluid-triggered paper actuator, has recently been
presented by Kong et al.21 Other mechanically
triggered valves are mostly based on manual actuation of a paper cantilever
(Figure 1a(iv)).22−26 Each of these techniques has their unique advantages and disadvantages
with regards to cost, automation, flexibility in design, and reliability.
In general, most of the presented techniques are either irreversible
(one way)14,18,23 or have a
slow switching dynamics.20,22,24,25 Of all presented systems, only
the fluid-triggered expanding element valves20,21 allow switching between two exit channels. Furthermore, the response
dynamics would be slow and erratic because the switching mechanism
depends on polymer swelling or paper deformation kinetics.

Magnetism
is widely used in microfluidics to exert contactless
and long-range attractive or repulsive forces on ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic,
or paramagnetic materials. Li et al.27 reported
a paper-based magnetomechanical valve fabricated by attaching an iron-loaded
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film on one side of a paper cantilever
(Figure 1b(i)). By
applying an external magnetic field, the cantilever deforms and comes
in contact with an underlying channel, allowing the fluid to flow
downstream, thus providing a reversible valve actuation. However,
this method has numerous limitations, the principle one of which is
the use of soft magnetic nanoparticles which implies that only attractive
magnetic forces can be used to close the valve. As the magnetic film
covers one side of the paper cantilever, fluid flow can only be achieved
through the opposite side, limiting the channel capacity and eliminating
the possibility of two-way valves. In summary, a majority of the reported
valves are, therefore, one-way and/or slow in actuation and hence
are comparable to an electric diode (applying electrical circuit theory
to microfluidics).28−30 To build logic-based (programmable) systems comparable
to conventional microfluidics from paper-based devices, the equivalent
of multiway switches and transistors is needed.

Recently, we
developed techniques to micropattern high-performance
hard magnetic polymer composites based on magnetic powders31 or pillars,32 characterized
by magnetic field gradients as high as 106 T/m. Paper–polymer
composites are also well-known, and permeation of polymeric materials
into paper has been reported.33 Building
on this success, we hypothesized that integrating spatially resolved
controlled wetting (hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones) coupled with
patterned hard magnets on paper will lead to a three-point, two-way
valve for wicking-based (filled channel) microfluidic devices. Herein,
we demonstrate that hard magnetic powders such as NdFeB can be directly
incorporated into paper (Figure 1b(ii)) to create a highly customizable (hackable and
stackable) two-way valve. In this case, both paper surfaces remain
available for capillary fluid transport and following magnetization
of the hard magnetic powder, the cantilever can attract or repel the
paper by applying a magnetic field and hence, switching the valve.
This allows for the first magnetic-μPAD (M-μPAD) compatible
two-way valve. We present two adaptable methods to fabricate such
a device, each being expandable to a variety of valve designs or platforms.

Valve
Design and Fabrication
To obtain a functional paper magnetic
valve, both surfaces of the
paper must remain accessible for capillary fluid transport. Ideally,
both capillary surfaces have the same size to guarantee a consistent
fluid flow. Furthermore, the magnetic particles should be isolated
from the moving liquid to avoid contamination of the analyte, degradation
of the magnetic particles, and/or unwanted reactions. We present two
different techniques to build paper magnetic valves (Figure 2). For brevity and clarity,
we designate these two approaches as follows: (i) depositing, compositing,
and magnetization (abbreviated DCM, Figure 2a) and (ii) embossing, impregnation, and
magnetization (abbreviated EIM, Figure 2b) techniques. Note that both techniques offer full
flexibility to design the valve geometry and the magnetoactive zone(s)
depending on the application. In this work, we chose valves that consist
of a disk pad (15 mm diameter) attached to a rectangular test strip
(5 × 25 mm). Magnetoactive zones were shaped as disks, open rings,
and squares. These magnetoactive zones were isolated or fixed onto
paper using PDMS. To mitigate reagent adsorption into the polymer
matrix, a trichloro perfluoroalkylsilane hydrophobic barrier was drawn
between the wicking channel and the deposited magnetoactive zone.34 The PDMS matrix can be replaced with other polymers
such as super glue or wax; however, the integrity of the microfluidic
channel may be compromised depending on the wetting/wicking properties
of the polymer (see superglue example, Figure S1).35,36 Viscous liquid polymers, such
as precured PDMS or molten wax, minimally spread in the lateral direction
but still get imbibed through the thickness of the paper, primarily
because of gravity.37−39 The higher viscosity also aids in the dispersion
of particles during mixing; therefore, a more homogeneous substrate
is obtained. For easier processing and device fabrication, the particles
were magnetized after device fabrication.

Figure 2 (a) The DCM method is
predicted to be more suitable for large-scale
production because the magnetic powder is embedded during the fabrication
of paper. (b) EIM method represents a more general route of making
magnetic valves.

Depositing, Compositing,
and Magnetization
The DCM
technique was developed to allow a large-scale production of paper
magnetic valves. Therefore, the magnetoactive regions were directly
integrated during the paper fabrication process. After fabricating
a sheet of paper through an ISO 5269/1 TAPPI process, the outline
of the valve was traced using a pen on the still-wet sheet (Figure 2a). Hard magnetic
powders were deposited through a transparent polyethylene terephthalate
mask to form the magnetoactive zone. Figure 2a shows the fabrication of a disk-shaped
magnetoactive zone; however, the shape of the zone can be adapted
to any need. A second sheet of the paper with identical properties
was fabricated and placed on the first one. The composite structure
was subsequently dried in a sheet dryer at 60 °C. This compound
paper was stable, and the process does not require additional chemical
binders. Further reinforcement of the magnetic particles, if needed,
can be attained by adding ca. 0.01 g of PDMS through the magnetoactive
zones, which upon curing (30 min curing time at 80 °C) will subsequently
coat and reinforce the fiber network, isolating the magnetic particles
from the flowing fluid.

Embossing, Impregnation, and Magnetization
Although
the DCM technique is suitable for scale-up and rapid prototyping,
the TAPPI process is not readily accessible, especially in resource-limited
settings. The EIM technique consists of a selective deposition of
the magnetic powder on the valve, such that the position of the particles
does not affect the fluidic flow through the channel nor interfere
with the analyte. First, the valve is cut out of a sheet of paper
followed by partial embossing of a C ring shape around the valve zone
to aid in the deposition of the magnetic particles (Figure 2b). From embossing, a step
(80 ± 20 μm) designating the magnetoactive region was created
using a three-dimensionally printed mold (Figure S2). Hard magnetic particles (NdFeB) dispersed in PDMS (mass
ratio of 5:1 PDMS/NdFeB) were then deposited on the embossed region.
Suspension (0.05 g) was used per device. The PDMS matrix wicks through
the paper and upon curing, immobilizes the particles in place without
compromising the channel portion of the device (Figure 2b).

Theoretical Understanding of Flow Behavior
in Paper
Fluid transport in paper has been qualitatively
investigated and
depends on the uniform surface chemistry and fiber uniformity and
follows transport behavior in porous media.40 For clarity and predictability, we empirically and in silico-evaluated
fluidic transport in our paper to assess for the predictability of
fluid behavior (see Supporting Information, Figure S8). For a pulsed flow using the valves proposed herein,
there should be two asymptotic time domains that can be used to separate
mixing from slug formation. The two dominant time domains are the
asymptotic physical limits of molecular diffusion and momentum transport.
Fluid flow in porous media is typically governed by Darcy’s
law which results in a reduced-order momentum equation that is based
on an average fluid velocity, u, and is of the form40,41  Here, μ denotes the
viscosity of the
fluid and, K, is typically the Darcy flow permeability.
Assuming a unidirectional motion and homogeneous permeability, the
equation may be integrated to determine an expression for the pressure
that drives fluid motion. It is generally understood that fluid motion
in fiber-based porous media is driven by a combination of capillary
pressure, that is, the wettability of the fluid on the fibers, and
the porosity, here denoted using ε. A general form of the equation
for capillary pressure is  

That is, measuring the capillary pressure
involves some direct measurement of contact angle θ and surface
tension, γ. Here, we write the function denoting porosity as f(ε) = (1 – ε)/ε such that materials
with a high porosity will tend to have a lower capillary pressure.40 The negative sign yields a vacuum gauge pressure
relative to a reference one which we take here to be zero. The last
variable, a, represents a length scale of the capillary
pressure which is typically considered to be the hydraulic fiber radius
which we take to be half a typical fiber width (∼20 μm).42 In practice, it is simpler to lump the capillary
pressure as a single term because measuring the parameters independently
is difficult. Furthermore, there is a direct relationship between
the permeability and porosity for paper-based porous media.42 Inserting the capillary pressure as the boundary
condition for Darcy flow over the arbitrary distance, L(t), and then noting that the unidirectional velocity
at the interface is u = dL/dt results in a familiar rate equation for the distance traveled
or L(t) = [2tKf(ε)γ cos θ/aμ]1/2. Note that this expression is similar to the reduced order form
of the Lucas–Washburn expression for capillary rise in a vertical
tube, that is, L ≈ t1/2.43,44 The rate of mass transport is
proportional to ωdiff = D/[(1 –
ε)t]2, where D is
the diffusivity, t is the paper thickness, and (1
– ε)t is the length occupied by the
paper. Valve pulse frequencies greater than this will always lead
to the mixing of two miscible fluids in the fiber channels. Similarly,
when the valve frequency is less than the displacement frequency ωdisp = 2Kf(ε)γ cos θ/μaL2, where L is the desired
distance traveled by the fluid, slug formation occurs. It is therefore
feasible to exploit actuation to introduce mixed or sequential bands
of liquids in a paper channel. This implies that microfluidic mixers
on capillary-driven channels can be realized or sequences of liquid
plugs akin to droplets of oil in water in regular microfluidics can
be obtained.

Results and Discussion
All fabricated
devices were evaluated for integrity by wicking
a colored aqueous fluid through the microfluidic channel. The papers
used in this work are fabricated in-house with no additives, hence
isolating their effect on the valve performance. Figure 3a shows a fabricated DCM valve
integrated into a M-μPAD, with the trapped hard magnetic particles
visible through the composite structure. The TAPPI process-fabricated
paper had a thickness of 149 ± 3 μm (per single sheet),
a basis weight of 120.5 g/m2, and a porosity of 0.47; thus,
the composite had a total thickness of 291 ± 3 μm. The
structure was magnetized in the out-of-plane direction under an applied
magnetic field of 1.5 T. A stray field out-of-plane component of 3.0
± 0.2 mT was measured at 1.5 mm above the magnetoactive surface.

fluid flowing only in the test channels. (c) SEM images of selected
areas in the EIM valve showing the impregnation of PDMS and the magnetic
particles on the paper. (d) Successful demonstration of a DCM valve
actuation test.

Similarly, Figure 3b shows a fabricated EIM device
(fabricated out of blotting paper)
with the fluidic channel holding blue colored water. The magnetoactive
zone does not wet and is therefore isolated from the channel (Figure 3b). A scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of the dispersed particles (Figure 3c) showed a stochastic distribution
in the matrix; hence, a Gaussian distribution of the magnetic field
strength is expected across the magnetoactive zone. Imaging the backside
of the magnetoactive zone reveals no particles, although the PDMS
matrix is shown to have permeated through. Comparing the backside
of this device with an untreated region shows that although the fiber
organization is not perturbed by the deposition process, the porosity
is however significantly different because of the presence of the
matrix in the former (Figure 3c). At 1.5 mm above the surface, the thus-fabricated and magnetized
magnetoactive zone emitted an out-of-plane stray magnetic field component
of 2.3 mT (±0.3 mT).

To demonstrate its applicability,
a strip-shaped DCM valve (including
a rectangular magnetoactive zone) was placed above a 5 V/400 mA powered
electromagnet (Figure 3d). By applying a magnetic field using an electromagnet, the one-way
valve closed and blue-stained water flowed through the valve. On turning
off the field, the valve subsequently opened and the fluid flow stopped.
The devices were also tested for actuation using a hard magnet. We
observe that irrespective of the configuration, the actuation (switching)
process is highly repeatable (>20×) with a negligible reduction
in magnetic response.

Valve Actuation
For versatility,
adoptability, and
tunability, M-μPADS should be designed to be portable and user
friendly. In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the volumetric field
gradient force on an object is given by  Here, M is the magnetization
vector of the object, in this case, the magnetoactive region of the
valve, and B is the induction vector
of the magnetic field source. Therefore, maximizing the field gradient
optimizes the attractive force on the valve. It could be advantageous
if the field source is electronically controlled (intensity or position)
and operated at a low voltage, hence amenable to a processor-based
control. As a field source, one could consider an electromagnet (as
discussed above) or a permanent magnet.

The commonly used Arduino
interface allows one to operate an electromagnet at a maximum of 5
V/400 mA, limiting the intensity of the magnetic field it can produce
(Figure S3, measured using a Gaussmeter)
and more severely, its magnetic field gradient induced by the coil
would be limited to 0.8 T/m. Furthermore, the coil heats up (∼40
°C), which might have some undesirable effects on the biochemical
assays performed with the M-μPAD. These issues can be resolved
by an appropriate choice of electromagnet size and its thermal management,
which is however beyond the scope of this work. We, therefore, propose
to fabricate valves using hard magnets. A NdFeB permanent magnet (Ø = 8 mm, height = 4 mm) provides 5 times greater field
gradient (4.6 T/m Figure 4a) at the same working distance (3 mm) as the electromagnet
discussed above. When the hard magnetic particles are magnetized in
the direction opposite to the magnetic field source, to produce a
repulsive force (position 2), the maximum strength of the magnetic
field source should be less than the coercive field value of the hard
magnetic particles so as not to (partially) demagnetize the magnetoactive
zones. The NdFeB hard magnetic particles used here have a coercive
field value of about 0.8 T, whereas the field produced at 3 mm above
the field source is 0.15 T (Figure S3),
rendering the reduction in magnetization negligible.

2 in 120 s. (c) Demonstration of an M-μPAD with alternating
reagents: (i) front view after 10 min, valve in neutral position and
(ii) top view.

To change the valve position,
we mounted two permanent magnets
(oriented in opposite directions) on a servo motor operated by an
Arduino microcontroller (the exact setup and source code can be found
in the Supporting Information and is shown
in Figure S3). Three positions were programmed to operate the valve:
position 1, valve open to the bottom channel (Figure 1), position 2, valve open to the top channel,
and position 0, valve closed (in the latter case, no magnet was positioned
under the valve). The opening of the valves after activation by an
external magnetic field is quasi instantaneous. However, in the case
of activation by an external permanent magnet, the latter must be
positioned below the valve using the servo motor. Because of the lag
in rotational movement, position switching of a valve operated with
a motor is about 0.6 s, whereas the valve operated by electromagnets
can be switched nearly instantaneously. However, the induced delay
is very reproducible as the motor always performs the same movement;
thus, the delay can be considered during programming of the sequence.
Finally, it is worth noting that this delay is very small compared
to the average flow speed of the liquid in our paper structure (which,
the experiment shows (Figure S4), is about
0.5 mm/s). The actuation speed of the valve is also influenced by
paper properties; depending on the porosity and paper chemistry, more
or less fluid can pass through the valve. A lighter paper can be operated
with a lower magnetophoretic force, hence, less particles. Gravitational
forces, however, will bend thinner paper toward position 1 when the
channel is filled with a fluid. Furthermore, wetting this paper reduces
its stiffness and smaller particle sizes are required for this region
to remain embossed. In contrast, a stiffer paper may require higher
forces to actuate a motion, but gravitational forces will have less
effect on them. Finally, the retracting force of the paper valve must
be greater than the capillary force between the wet surfaces to allow
the valve to return to position 0 (closed).

Applications of Magnetic
Two-Way Valves in a Sequential Fluid
Delivery
The key advantages of two-way paper-based valves
are hypothesized to be their capabilities to perform an automated,
programmable, and controlled multistep liquid delivery especially
from multiple inlets into a single outlet. This capability could garner
applications in immunoassays where multiple wash steps or timed reagent
additions are necessary. Conventional lateral flow immunoassays, for
example, are limited to a single-step delivery of chemicals, without
the capability to add washing, blocking steps, or signal amplifying
reagents.45−47 The automated addition of critical components onto
highly sensitive assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
could significantly improve their limit of detection, lower contamination
events, and boost reproducibility (hence reliability). Thus, we propose
the incorporation of magnetoactive zones onto conventional paper-based
PoC strips as a unique approach toward automated, multichannel, paper-based
devices.

To demonstrate the applicability of these devices,
we built an M-μPAD demonstration compatible with both magnetic
valve techniques (DCM & EIM). First, a single source and drain
channel configuration was fabricated using the DCM valve (Figure 4b(i)). In these devices,
the valve acts as a timer, where the rate of wicking in the drain
channel is slowed down by cutting off the supply. This is important
where reagents are embedded in the paper and time is needed for a
reaction to reach completion. Although we demonstrate the DCM valve
with a single source and drain, this can be extended to two sources
with the separation space acting as a neutral (0 point) and each reagent
being designated as + or – relative to the z-axis.

In our EIM-based prototype, two reagent pads connected
to a reservoir
with syringe needles were used as the source with a channel that feeds
into the valve and subsequently wicks to the drain channel Figure 4b(ii). The drain
channel was terminated with a waste pad to ensure a continuous flow.
Colored aqueous solutions were introduced into the device via a microfluidic
syringe pump providing blue (reagent 1) and red (reagent 2) solutions
at 0.01 mL s–1. Because these devices are wicking-based,
a pump-free configuration could also be set up, exploiting either
capillary rise or gravity to deliver the dyes into the source channels
and across the valve. In Figure 4b(iii), the valve was first opened toward reagent 1
(blue), which fills up the drain channel with the blue dye. After
120 s, the valve was switched toward reagent 2 (red), which allows
the red dye to enter the test strip. Finally, the valve was closed
toward position 0, which stops the fluid flow.

On the basis
of the ability to switch between one source channel
to another orthogonal to fluidic flow (along the z-axis), we envisioned that an array of blue-red color sequences (stripes)
can be loaded into the drain channel by programming timed switching
between the two source channels, making these devices a dynamic valve.
To demonstrate the dynamic properties of this magnetic valve system,
we recorded a sequence in which an EIM-M-μPAD was flipped between
position 1 and 2 at a frequency of approximately 10 mHz. A video can
be found in the Supporting Information (accelerated
20×) while Figure 4c shows a snapshot of a recording after 10 min. During this time,
the valve switched six times between the two fluid supplies, providing
a blue/red barcode-like channel coloring. The ability to sequentially
add different liquids in a highly controlled manner could potentially
open new applications in paper microfluidics, especially in the area
of diagnostics,24,48,49 bioenvironmental analysis,50 or fabrication
of neoteric platforms such as in infochemistry.51,52 A minimum cycle of 20× was performed without change in performance.
Also, an analysis of the fluid velocity depending on the valve position
can be found in Figure S4.

While
we demonstrate that EIM-based M-μPAD can create alternating
blocks (red-blue), mixing of liquids was also achieved. Darcy’s
law predicts that the fluid pressure will drop in longer paper segments
leading to a significant drop in the flow rate. We therefore hypothesized
and demonstrated that the establishment of stripes of alternating
colors depends on an equilibrium between the switching frequency and
the wicking rate. When the switching frequency is sufficiently low,
the source fluid significantly wicks away from the valve allowing
the creation of band structures. When the switching frequency is significantly
higher, it can be anticipated that the lateral displacement of the
liquid into the drain channel will be insignificant; hence, the contact
with a second fluid leads to mixing. By tuning the switching frequency,
we can therefore induce mixing at different segments of the test strip
and create separated bands as needed (purple color, Figure S5). At higher frequencies (0.1 Hz), we observed direct
mixing in the valve entry regions. In this case, the primary (blue)
fluid does not significantly wick into the drain channel before the
introduction of the second reagent (red) leading to mixing (purple).
Reagent mixing can also be controlled by changing the test strip length,
as predicted by Darcy’s law. We therefore infer that these
valve systems are dynamic and tunable because the presence of bands
or mixed states can be achieved by tuning the M-μPAD geometry,
switching frequency, channel size, and viscous properties of the fluid.

Compared to previously reported paper-based valve systems, these
magnetic two-way valves and associated M-μPADS have several
advantages: (i) they are cyclic valves that can be opened or closed
multiple times, (ii) the presented two-way valves are the first paper-based
magnetic valves that possess a neutral position, two inlets and one
outlet system, opening a new range of possibilities for making paper-based
three-dimensional (3D) networks. These devices have a potential to
adapt to multiple source channels. The valve can also be inverted,
resulting in a one-inlet and two-outlet system, creating new opportunities
for fluid separation, (iii) M-μPADS implemented here are based
on programmable microprocessor electronics and therefore can be either
triggered using human–machine interfaces, such as buttons or
other advanced interfaces such as touchscreens or operated autonomously
based on a predefined procedure, and (iv) finally, M-μPADS come
with full flexibility in design and fabrication, making their production
amenable to large-industrial applications (DCM) or for smaller research
and prototyping environments (EIM).

Despite their advantages,
M-μPADS present two shortcomings:
(i) the design relies on paper-based 3D multilayer [either open channel
or wicking (so-called closed channel)53 devices which are more complex to fabricate than classical two-dimensional
paper devices. Nonetheless, there is now a large expertise in multilayer
paper devices,12,20,23,54 and their fabrication is becoming cheaper
and more efficient compared to classical (open channel) microfluidic
lab-on-chip devices. (ii) M-μPADS, by definition, require magnetic
actuation either by electromagnets or permanent magnets, and both
must be actuated by an electronic circuit. The price of these components
is in strong contrast with the low costs of the paper components;
however, recent evidence points toward efficiency rather than zero
cost as the critical variable in PoC/use devices.55 To mitigate lifetime cost of the devices, the magnets can
be encapsulated and physisorbed onto the paper, allowing users to
reuse the magnetoactive zones on different test strips, hence lowering
the total cost of the devices, that is, the actuators are transferable
from one device configuration to another. This could potentially lower
both the fabrication cost and environmental impact, especially when
using rare earth magnets. Such a design will, however, make the devices
less user friendly, which is crucial in PoC devices. Furthermore,
by combining the small-scale and wireless nature of such devices,
they can be easily integrated into handheld devices such as the multidisease
diagnostic devices recently developed by Liu and co-workers.56,57 Overall, the devices reported herein have a significant potential
in the development of pump-free microfluidics, as highlighted below.

Prospects
Flow in capillary microfluidics29 and
paper-based microfluidics7,54 is
often explained with the hydraulic–electric circuit where the
resistance to flow corresponds to the electrical resistance, the volumetric
flow rate to the electrical current, and the pressure drop to the
potential drop. Classical microfluidic devices have been designed
and developed in an analogous fashion to electronic components.30 In paper-based microfluidics, Chen et al.18 described the valves they presented as diodes
because fluids can only flow through them in one direction. One-way
paper magnetic valves27 can also be compared
to transistors as they can be (i) opened, (ii) closed, or (iii) regulate
the amount of fluid flow through high-frequency open–close
operations. In this analogy, the two-way paper magnetic valves described
in this paper are analogous to both a transistor and also to a single-pole
double-throw relay, allowing diversification of the device complexity
beyond a simple switch. These valves are, therefore, logical operators
that will likely open new capabilities in the near future.

Simplicity
Microfluidic devices embody the power of
stackable and hackable simplicity and hence have a potential for a
significant impact in research and technology development.58,59 Gated microfluidic devices offer an opportunity to develop a diverse
array of devices to address otherwise complex problems. The equivalence
of a good microfluidic valve to a transistor or a switch embeds within
it the potential for diversification into a complex system such as
a computer network (best captured by the internet) albeit without
the complexity of quantum phenomena in electronic devices. The magnetically
actuated valves presented in this article can be easily stacked by
the addition of multiple ports and valves to create multiple sources
or drains. Furthermore, as previously described, our system is also
highly customizable—“hackable” in terms of geometry,
modulating frequency, and paper properties. Thus, we infer that the
innovation conveyed here is a simple solution for the advancing field
of wicking-based microfluidic devices.

Conclusion
The reported three-point magnetic valves allow for selective, programmable,
and tunable delivery of fluids across a source and drain in a manner
that can be adapted into more complex device structures. The fabrication
is rapid, and devices are relatively efficient and low cost. Specifically,
we demonstrated that(i) two-way microfluidic valves can be
fabricated with electromagnets or permanent magnets, and these devices
can be tuned to form mixtures of separated plugs of different solutions;

(ii) by exploiting the well-known
fluid
transport in porous media, the capillary-driven flow properties of
a liquid on a paper can be predicted and exploited to design an actuation
scheme that leads to mixing or consecutive bands of solutions; and

(iii) the developed valves
can be extended
to more complex microfluidic device layouts to create elaborate bioanalytical
platforms for effective and rapid sensing, diagnostics, or sample
preparation.



Materials and Methods
Materials
Gas-atomized NdFeB particles (MQP-S-11-9)
were provided by Magnequench GmbH (Germany) and sieved to obtain an
average size of 40 μm. These particles were magnetized under
1.5 T using a Harvey Wells (USA) electromagnet. All induced magnetic
fields were measured using a Gaussmeter from FW Bell (USA) model 5080.
The Arduino Uno R3 board, Grove electromagnet, servo motor, and all
electronic components were obtained from Seeed Technology Co., Ltd
(China). NdFeB magnets were obtained from supermagnete Webcraft GmbH
(Germany). PDMS Sylgard 184 was obtained from Dow Corning and (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Duro Super
Glue was purchased from the Iowa State University Chemistry Store.
Food coloring was obtained from Ach Food Companies, Inc. All components
were used as received. A cost approximation can be found in Table S6.

Experimental Methods
In general, all components of
the 3D paper networks (M-μPADS, including EIM valve) were built
using industrial blotting paper fabricated in-house. This cellulose
fiber-based material was made from a mix of softwood and hardwood
fibers, with no added fillers, on a pilot paper machine. This paper
had a thickness of 493 ± 17 μm (micrometer Lhomargy (ISO
534:2011)) with a grammage of 287.4 g/m2 (ISO 536:2012)
and a porosity of 0.62 (by comparison with the fiber density of cellulose).
This material has been shown to maintain its strength and rigidity
under wet conditions.60 The paper used
for the DCM valves were produced using an ISO 5269-2:2005 (DIN 54
358) TAPPI process machine, a sheet former for the preparation of
laboratory sheets of pulp.

All paper components (valves, structural
components) were cut using a Cameo Omega 2, Silhouette America, Inc.
(USA) craft cutter. The paper was embossed using 3D-printed (FlashForge
3D printer, dual extruder, USA) molds. To prevent any contact of the
biological sample with the magnetic particles, a hydrophobic barrier
was incorporated in certain valves between the magnetoactive zone
and the capillary surface. To do this, we followed the procedure reported
before by Oyola-Reynoso et al. on the TACH hand-drawn technique61 (Figure S7). A sketch
ball pen was used to deposit a hydrophobic “ink” composed
of 5:1 v/v % of hexane and silane. The structural components of the
M-μPAD device were modified chemically to prevent any leakage
from the inlets. The modification was performed through chemical vapor
deposition of silane.62 In a clean and
dry desiccator, precut paper samples were placed followed by 0.1 mL
of alkylsilanes in a 10 mL dram vial. The desiccator was evacuated
(∼30 mmHg pressure), fixed, and placed in a preheated
oven at 95 °C for 10 h. The M-μPADS were assembled using
layers of paper and commercial tape.3 Water
dyed with food coloring (ACH Food Companies) was injected into M-μPADS
using a Fusion 720 syringe pump by Chemyx, Inc. SEM was performed
using FEI Inspect F50.
