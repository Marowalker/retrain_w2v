The sterically bulky
compounds N,N′-bismesityl
phenanthrene-9,10-diimine [1] and
imine–nitrone [2] were synthesized. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report of the synthesis of a bulky
steric imine–nitrone accessed from the secondary ketimine using
urea hydrogen peroxide over methyltrioxorhenium catalyst. Purified
compounds were characterized using 1H and 13C NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and infrared spectrometry.
We report the first crystal structure of compound 1.
Detailed IR bands of compounds 1 and 2 were
assigned by comparing experimentally measured spectra to individually
animated modes of quantum mechanically computed spectra. We believe
these compounds may be of use as bidentate ligands in the synthesis
of novel organometallic compounds. The asymmetric N and O coordination
sites of compound 2 might impart interesting electronic
effects to organometallic compounds compared to the symmetric N,N′-coordination sites of compound 1.

1 Introduction
Nitrones
have various chemical uses, for example, [3 + 2]-dipolar
cycloaddition reactions1 that yield isoxazolidines,
easy to handle intermediates, which are used in the synthesis of natural
products and pharmaceutical agents that contain amino acids, 1,3-amino
alcohols, or β-lactams.2,3 Nitrones are also used
in spin trapping experiments as a means to detect free radicals in
a reliable manner to probe the mechanistic roles of these species
in biochemistry, medicine, and toxicology.4 In addition, we have previously shown that density functional theory
(DFT) calculations predict Zr/Hf organometallic catalysts with two
imine–nitrone ligands could potentially generate epoxides from
alkenes without any allylic hydrogen atoms.5−100

Various
methods exist for nitrone synthesis. A microwave-assisted
method is used to prepare ketonitrones via the union of isatin or
indanone derivatives with hydroxylamines.7 Asymmetric nitrones can be prepared from the copper-catalyzed hydroamination
of cyclopropanes with oximes.8 Gold-supported
silica gel catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of N,N-disubstituted hydroxyamines to nitrones.9 Also of note, iridium catalysts can be used to prepare
cyclic and macrocyclic nitrones from N-hydroxyamides.10 Visible light irradiation of CdS nanorods has
been employed to synthesize aldonitrones from aromatic aldehydes and
nitros.11

Methyltrioxorhenium (MTO)
and either hydrogen peroxide or urea
hydrogen peroxide (UHP) are an exceptional reagent for preparing nitrones
from various sources including primary12 and secondary amines,13 hydroxylamines,14 and imines.15 Aldimine
has been previously used as an imine source in the synthesis of aldonitrone
products using MTO (Scheme 1). In this work, we report that MTO and UHP can be used to
prepare ketonitrones from ketimines (Scheme 1). To the best of our knowledge, there has
been no previous report of this catalyst system being used in this
manner.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Aldimines and Ketimines with urea·H2O2 (UHP) and CH3ReO3 (MTO)
Recently, a secondary ketimine-substituted
phenanthene-9,10-diimine
was reported and used as a component of transition-metal complexes
for olefin polymerization.16−18 Related, Heyduk and co-workers
have previously synthesized N,N′-bismesityl
phenathrene-9,10-diimine (1) and used it to react with
(catecholate)PdCl2 for investigating the electronic properties
of Pd complexes.19 Here, we report the
first crystal structure of compound 1.

We were
able to access N,N′-bismesityl
phenanthrene-9-imine-10-nitrone (2) from compound 1 using UHP as oxidant over MTO as catalyst (Scheme 2). To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first reported imine–nitrone compound of this type
(right panel of Scheme 3), which can potentially see use as a ligand in transition-metal
complexes, where the large conjugate backbone and asymmetric bidentate
N, O coordination sites should help to modulate the electronic properties
of the complex. Layer previously reported an imine–nitroxide
radical containing a saturated six-membered ring connecting the imine
and nitroxide groups (left panel of Scheme 3).20 In contrast,
our structure contains an unsaturated ring connecting the imine and
nitrone groups.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 N,N′-Bismesityl
Phenanthrene-9,10-diimine
Compound 1 was prepared
from the reaction of 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesitylaniline) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone
in anhydrous toluene with titanium tetrachloride as catalyst at room
temperature as shown in Scheme 2 based on a literature method for related compounds.21 After completion of the reaction, the desired
product was purified by silica gel column chromatography and was confirmed
by elemental analysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The C,
H, and N contents were found consistent with calculated values, and
the mass spectrum of compound 1 (C32H30N2) showed a peak at m/z = 443.2479, which represents the molecular ion [M + H]+.

The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 (Figure S1) displayed signals confirming
the (E, Z) isomer, in which the
two mesityl groups produce inequivalent 1H NMR peaks. The 1H NMR spectrum clearly displayed twice as many signals as
would be expected for a symmetrical structure with two identical mesityl
groups (e.g., (E, E) or (Z, Z) isomer). There were seven signals for aromatic hydrogens
from the phenanthrene unit, two signals for aromatic protons on the
mesityls, and four signals for methyl groups on the mesityls. Two
singlet peaks at 6.65 and 6.81 were attributed to aromatic protons
at the ortho positions of two inequivalent mesityl groups. The great
difference of the chemical shift for protons H-1 (δ = 6.76 ppm)
and H-8 (δ = 8.31 ppm) with doublet splitting in phenanthrene
was due to the influence from the aryl substituents ring current.
The protons H-4 and H-5 whose doublets overlapped at δ = 7.92
are the least influenced by substituents on the aryl group. The remaining
four protons H-2, H-3, H-6, H-7 are triplets and were assigned as
δ = 6.95, 7.40, 7.62, 7.51 ppm, respectively. The protons from
the methyl groups at the meta and para positions of the two N,N′-substituted mesityls showed
two 2:1 ratio signals where δ = 1.35, 2.01 have twice the amplitudes
of 2.18, 2.27 ppm.

In the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S2), three C-methyl signals appeared between 16 and 24 ppm.
Two pairs of different N=C (phenanthrene) peaks at 145.0 and
146.4 ppm and C–N (mesityl) peaks at 158.3 and 160.4 ppm confirm
different configurations with respect to C=N bonds. This is
similar to the signal patterns for the N,N′-bis-2,6-dimethylaniline phenanthrene-9,10-diimine
in Cherkasov et al.’s
paper and suggests (E, Z) isomer.21

Crystals of compound 1 suitable
for X-ray crystallographic
analysis were obtained by evaporating its acetone solution. The crystal
structure is shown in Figure 1. The crystal data, collection parameters, and refinements
conditions are listed in Table 1. The selected bond lengths and angles are summarized in Table 2. The N1=C1
and N2=C2 double bonds (1.2755(14) and 1.2738(14) Å) and
N1–C15 and N2–C24 single bonds (1.4270(13) and 1.4206(14)
Å) are within the range of what has been reported for similar
phenanthrene-9,10-diimines.21−24 Because the central ring of the phenanthrene is not
aromatic, it twists and forms a dihedral angle of 146.16(11)°
along C13–C14–C1–C2 with a 16.19(6)° angle
between the C3–C8 and C9–C14 rings. Due to steric effects
and the twisting of the phenanthrene, the two mesityl rings are rotated
by 78.76(6)° with respect to one another.

Comparing experimental to calculated infrared spectra
is an important
tool to distinguish between different chemical isomers that have the
same atoms arranged in different ways. This will be especially important
for compound 2 as discussed in the next section.

The experimental and calculated infrared spectra of compound 1 are overlaid in Figure 2. The calculation of infrared spectrum was performed
at the DFT/B3LYP level using 6-311++G** within Gaussian09.25 Fundamental modes of the calculated spectrum
were animated in GaussView software.25Table 3 lists the experimental
and calculated vibrational frequencies with assignments of vibrational
modes. Due to density functional and basis set effect in combination
with anharmonic effect not considered in calculations, it is common
practice to scale down the calculated harmonic frequencies to improve
agreement with experimental values. With regard to B3LYP/6-311++G**,
the scale factor 0.967 was used for vibration frequencies for compounds 1 and 2.

2.2 N,N′-Bismesityl
Phenanthrene-9-imine-10-nitrone
MTO catalyst and UHP have
been used to prepare nitrone from secondary aldimine.15 Here, however, we synthesize the nitrone compound 2 from secondary ketimine. The oxidation of compound 1 with UHP over MTO catalyst produces compound 2 with 81–86% yield. Compound 2 shows the anticipated
peak [M + Na]+ in its mass spectrum with accurate mass
measurement and appropriate isotopic distribution.

In Figure S4, four triplets (H-2, H-3, H-6, H-7
positions), four doublets (H-1, H-4, H-5, H-8 positions), and two
singlets (aromatic protons from mesityl groups) in aromatic region
(i.e., from 6.5 to 9.5 ppm) are observed in the 1H NMR
spectrum of compound 2. The protons from methyl group
at meta and para positions in two N,N′-substituted mesityl groups showed two 2:1 ratio signals
where δ = 1.29, 2.24 have twice the amplitudes of 2.17, 2.30
ppm. The chemical shifts of aromatic phenanthrene proton (H-8) and
methyl proton from the one mesityl group closer to the −C=N–O
group are found at 9.39 and 2.24 ppm, respectively.

We have
no knowledge regarding whether the E or Z end of the diimine molecule was most reactive to form
the nitrone group. Also, we have no knowledge of whether the unreacted
imine group in the imine nitrone is of E or Z form. Furthermore, the amount of dinitrone formed was
always small (≤∼10%) even when the equivalents of UHP
and the reaction time were increased. This was true even though the
reaction was carried out with a large excess of UHP.

Oxaziridines
contain a three-membered carbon–nitrogen–oxygen
ring. We wanted to avoid oxaziridine formation because our goal was
to make the nitrone. We explicitly chose the UHP and MTO system in
alcoholic solvents because Soldaini et al.15 reported that it can convert some imines to nitrones directly without
going through the oxaziridine. Soldaini et al. reported that choice
of solvent is important for this kind of reaction.15 We monitored the reaction progress using thin liquid chromatography
(TLC) and NMR. No spot on the TLC plate was observed for oxaziridine,
and none of our NMR results indicated oxaziridine formation. Our results
are consistent with the hypothesis that nitrone was produced directly
during the reaction. As explained below, infrared spectroscopy definitely
confirmed that the produced product was nitrone and not oxaziridine.

The infrared spectrum of compound 2 was calculated
with B3LYP/6-311++G**. The experimental and calculated infrared spectra
of compound 2 are overlaid in Figure 3. Table 4 lists the experimental and calculated vibrational
frequencies with assignments of vibrational modes.

From diimine to imine–nitrone,
the local symmetric vibrational
mode of N–C=C–N is destroyed due to the coordination
of oxygen to nitrogen (N=C). Two peaks (1649 and 1625 cm–1) corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric stretching
modes of C=N in compound 1 contrast to compound 2 C=N stretching modes at 1624 cm–1 (for N not bound to O) and 1509 cm–1 (for N bound
to O). The N–O stretching mode of compound 2 is
located at 1217 cm–1. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit similar frequency modes for the ring backbone of
phenanthrene unit. The calculated IR data also match the change from
diimine to imine–nitrone, as shown in Tables 3 and 4.

Two
structures (three-membered ring NCO and five-membered ring
NONCC) isomeric to imine–nitrone were geometry optimized, as
shown in Figure 4.
The theoretical characteristic vibrational modes of these isomers
are listed in Table 5. Calculated C=N (N bonding with O) and N–O stretching
modes of imine–nitrone are located at 1492 and 1245 cm–1, respectively. C–N and N–O stretching
modes in the three-membered ring are at 1298 and 813 cm–1, respectively. The symmetric stretching mode C–N in five-membered
ring NONCC exists at 1346 cm–1. In addition, N–O
stretching mode and N–O–N bending mode in five-membered
ring are calculated at 892 and 850 cm–1, respectively.
The most solid evidence for distinguishing the imine–nitrone
from related isomers is the experimental peak at 1505 cm–1, only its C=N (N bonded with O) vibrational frequency matches
this peak. Neither the three-membered ring NCO nor the five-membered
ring NONCC has a strong vibrational peak close to it. Therefore, the
experimental IR spectrum indicated the compound from oxidation of
secondary ketimine with UHP over MTO catalyst is imine–nitrone
not three-membered ring NCO or five-membered ring NONCC.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized N,N′-bismesityl phenanthrene-9,10-diimine (compound 1) and N,N′-bismesityl phenanthrene-9-imine-10-nitrone
(compound 2). We report the first crystal structure of
compound 1. It possesses a dis-coplanar geometric structure
due to the bulky mesityl groups, similar to other substituted phenanthrene-9,10-diimines.
We report the first synthesis of compound 2. Compound 2 was synthesized from compound 1 using UHP over
MTO catalyst at room temperature. This synthesis route provides access
to a new class of imine–ketonitrone compounds through oxidation
of secondary diketimines under mild conditions. The infrared spectra
of compounds 1 and 2 were analyzed in detail
by comparing experimental spectra to animated modes of quantum mechanically
computed spectra. This distinguished compound 2 from
isomeric compounds. In the future, compounds 1 and 2 and related compounds could potentially be used as bidentate
ligands to make organometallic compounds for various applications.
The asymmetric N and O coordination sites of the imine–nitrone
might impart interesting electronic effects to organometallic compounds
compared to the symmetric N,N′
coordination sites of the diimine.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 General Information
All chemicals
were reagent grade and were used as received.

4.2 Physical
Measurements
IR spectra
were recorded on a Thermo Scientific, Nicolet iS-10 FT-IR Spectrometer
with a range of 650–4000 cm–1. 1H and 13C NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Varian
Oxford 300 MHz NMR spectrometer with CDCl3 as a solvent
at 298 K. The purity determination of the product and reaction monitoring
were accomplished by TLC on silica gel plates. Microelement analysis
was performed in Atlantic Microlab Inc (Norcross, GA). The high-resolution
mass spectrum was collected and analyzed by Dominion University Mass
Spectrometer Center (Norfolk, VA). The high purity (>98%) of compound 1 was clearly established using elemental analysis in conjunction
with the other characterization methods. Compound 2 was
90–95% pure; we would like to have produced higher purity,
but even with repeated column chromatography purifications this was
the best we could produce.

4.3 Synthetic Procedures
4.3.1 N,N′-Bismesityl
Phenanthrene-9,10-diimine
The reaction was performed under
nitrogen protection. The 500 mL three-neck round-bottom flask with
magnetic stirring bar was nitrogen purged three cycles, then followed
by cannula transfer of 150 mL of anhydrous toluene. Poured 9,10-phenanthrenequinone
(5.00 g, 24.0 mmol) into the flask, then added trimethylaniline (20.5
mL, 146 mmol) and 24 mL of 1M TiCl4 (24.0 mmol) in toluene
dropwise. After 24 h reaction, poured 200 mL of water into the reaction
mixture, continued to wash the reaction mixture 3 × 200 mL of
water. The organic phase was separated by separatory funnel and dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4, then filtered and removed
solvent under rotavaporator. The 6 g of crude product was purified
by silica gel column with eluent hexane/EtOAc (40:1). The pure phenanthrene-9,10-diimine
(5.85 g, 13.2 mmol) was obtained. The yield was 55%. 1H
NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm, J/Hz): 1.35 (s, 6H, o-Me,

4.3.2 N,N′-Bismesityl
Phenanthrene-9-imine-10-nitrone
Weighed phenanthrene-9,10-diimine
(603 mg, 1.36 mmol) into 25 mL vial, added 15 mL of dichloromethane
to dissolve it. Then, 3 mL of urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) methanol
solution (703 mg UHP, 7.47 mmol) and methyltrioxorhenium (25.7 mg,
0.10 mmol) were added. The reaction was kept stirring for 24 h at
room temperature. The completion was indicated by disappearance of
the starting material shown on TLC (hexane/EtOAc 3:1). Removed solvent
under reduced vacuum and washed the solid with 20 mL of dichloromethane.
Filtered out the white solid. Solvent was removed from the filtrate
to obtain the crude product. N,N′-Bismesityl phenanthrene-9-imine-10-nitrone was flushed out
of the silica gel column with eluent hexane/EtOAc (20:1). The yield
was 81–86% with 0.56 g of product at 90–95% purity (500–530
mg N,N′-bismesityl phenanthrene-9-imine-10-nitrone,
1.1–1.2 mmol). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm, J/Hz): 1.29 (s, 6H, o-Me, mesityl), 2.24 (s, 6H, o-Me,

4.4 Crystallography
The X-ray data for N,N′-bismesityl
phenanthrene-9,10-diimine
were collected on a Bruker Kappa APEX II CCD system equipped with
a graphite monochromator and a Mo Kα fine-focus tube (λ
= 0.71073 Å) at a temperature of 120 K. The collected frames
were integrated with the Bruker SAINT software package26 using a narrow-frame algorithm. The data were
corrected for absorption effects using the Multi-Scan method (SADABS).26 The structure was solved and refined using the
Bruker SHELXTL Software Package27 within
APEX326 and OLEX2,28 using the space group C2/c, with Z = 8 for the formula unit, C32H30N2. Nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen
atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions with Uiso = 1.2Uequiv of
the parent atom (Uiso = 1.5Uequiv for methyl). The final anisotropic full-matrix least-squares
refinement on F2 with 313 variables converged
at R1 = 4.59% for the observed data and
wR2 = 12.40% for all data. The goodness-of-fit
was 1.037. Crystallographic data together with refinement details
are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the
molecular structure and atom-labeling scheme for compound N,N′-bismesityl phenanthrene-9,10-diimine 1. The structure was drawn with 50% displacements using Mercury
3.9 software for Windows.29 Crystallographic
