In
the present mini-review we discuss the findings, controversies,
and gaps observed for the Ugi four-component reaction. The Ugi multicomponent
reaction, performed by mixing an aldehyde, an amine, a carboxylic
acid, and an isocyanide, is among the most important isocyanide-based
multicomponent reactions (MCRs), allowing multiple bond formations
(C–C and C–N) in a single synthetic step. The possibility
of two reaction pathways and the little understood solvent effect
over this transformation renders this reaction as one of the hardest
challenges to overcome. The little knowledge of the mechanism of the
Ugi MCR hinders the development of new and efficient chiral catalytic
systems to further the application of the derivatives obtained by
enantioselective versions. The asymmetric transformation is in this
context a bigger challenge, and little is known about the mechanism
of these few available versions. The new trend of functional chromophore
synthesis by MCRs is also highlighted, and the few examples already
disclosed in the literature exemplify the huge opportunity for investigation
and creative ideas using the Ugi four-component reaction.

==== Body
Introduction
The Ugi multicomponent reaction (MCR)
is the eponymous of a four-component
transformation disclosed in 1959 by Ivar Ugi.1 This important transformation belongs to the class of the so-called
isocyanide-based MCRs and demands the use of an aldehyde, an amine,
an isocyanide, and a carboxylic acid to take place and affords an
α-acetoamido carboxamide derivative (Scheme 1). The Ugi adducts are sometimes referred
to as peptoids. The large number of available publications describing
different features, conditions, catalysts, effects, diversity-oriented
syntheses, and application of such MCR adducts leaves no doubt of
both the importance and the feasibility of the reaction as a synthetic
tool available in the modern Organic Chemistry toolbox.

Scheme 1 General
Ugi Four-Component Multicomponent Reaction (U-4CR)
Although the Ugi MCR is largely studied in relation to
its synthetic
application and diversity-oriented syntheses, there is plenty of room
in terms of mechanistic investigations and in the design (and synthesis)
of new fluorescent derivatives, as we intend to critically show herein.
One may indeed conclude that little knowledge is available to support
the development of new catalysts and to control the enantioselectivity
(or diastereoselectivity) of this tricky transformation.

The
possibility of more than one reaction mechanistic pathway operating
at the same time in a concurrent manner renders the attempts to decipher
the key parameters to control this MCR as a highly complex challenge,
especially to reach a rationale for the chiral induction step of enantio-
and diastereoselective versions.

Many applications are noted
in the current literature related to
the Ugi MCR. A recent and important trend is the synthesis of functional
chromophores using MCRs.2 Fluorescent Ugi
adduct derivatives have been barely explored. As will be shown herein,
only a few examples have been described exploring the “photo”
properties of these molecules. There are almost no reports of the
use of these fluorescent derivatives as bioimaging probes.

In
the current mini-review, we intend to show the readers state-of-the-art
information regarding the mechanistic knowledge and what is currently
under debate. A separated section will discuss the enantioselective
version of the Ugi MCR and the available mechanistic evidence. The
application of fluorescent derivatives focusing on their design and
emission properties will be also analyzed and disclosed herein. Variations
of the Ugi MCR (reviewed elsewhere3) are
outside the scope of this manuscript, and these articles will be cited
only as exceptions.

Ugi Multicomponent Reaction Mechanisms
As is usual for MCRs, it has been proposed that there is more than
one reaction pathway for the Ugi transformation. MCRs typically have
two (or more) reaction pathways occurring at the same time;4 however, they are also usually convergent, and
the final adduct may be formed through different reaction pathways.
The conditions to select one mechanism instead of the others are however
still unclear for most of the MCRs.4 Today,
the current understanding is that the Ugi four-component reaction
may proceed through two competitive reaction pathways, as seen in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Current Two Debated
General Reaction Pathways Observed for the Ugi
Multicomponent (Four-Component) Reaction
The solvent choice to conduct the Ugi reaction has some contrasting
reports. Polar and protic solvents (e.g., methanol, ethanol, or trifluoroethanol)
are the common preference for the Ugi 4-CR, but polar aprotic solvents
(THF, DMF, dioxane, or dichloromethane) may also return good results
in some specific reactions.5 For some cases,
aqueous media may also be used with relative success.5 The preferences for protic solvents rely on the fact that
the intermediates noted in the general mechanisms (Scheme 2) are polar derivatives (prone
to H-bond formation) that are consequently stabilized in these solvents.
The proton transfer TS (see Scheme 2) may aid the understanding of this preference. Aprotic
solvents may help in the stabilization of the proposed TS, despite
the fact that the formation of the first key intermediate (i.e., imine
or iminium ion in Scheme 2) may be favored in polar and protic solvents.

Despite
the fact that there are disputes about the current preferred
reaction pathway of the Ugi reaction, some features were widely accepted,
i.e., the imine (or the iminium) formation as the first intermediate.
This intermediate plays a key role in conducting the reaction toward
the final adduct, as we have shown.6 Two
possibilities are however viable, that is, the isocyanide addition
(classical view) affording the nitrilium ion or the carboxylic acid
insertion, as proposed a few years ago,7 leading to the hemiaminal intermediate (Scheme 3). Both proposals converge to the imidate
intermediate, which in turn undergoes the Mumm rearrangement and affords
the final Ugi adduct.

Scheme 3 Competitive Mechanisms from the Iminium
Ion
Although the classical view
of the Ugi reaction mechanism was accepted
until it was challenged by the breakthrough report of Fleurat-Lessard
and co-workers,7 a systematic evaluation
was only reported a few years ago by our group.6 In the work, we disclosed6 a
systematic investigation of the Ugi four-component reaction by ESI-MS(/MS)
and applying the charge tag strategy for MS mechanistic investigations8 using imidazolium derivative reagents (Scheme 4).9 The strategy allowed for the detection and characterization
of key intermediates and pointed firmly to the preference of the classical
view of the reaction with the formation of the nitrilium ion (Scheme 3). In the experiment,
no intermediate of the hemiaminal pathway could be observed.

Scheme 4 Charge-Tagged Reagents, Detected and Characterized Intermediates,
and Side Reaction of the Ugi Four-Component Reaction Evaluated by
ESI-MS(/MS)
The use of the charge-tagged
reagents allowed for the detection
and characterization of the key iminium (or imine) intermediate of m/z 138 and of m/z 120 using the charge-tagged reagent and the ordinary reagent,
respectively. Before the detection of this intermediate, no other
intermediates were noted, and this pointed to the importance of this
mechanistic step which is usually not pointed out as the rate-limiting
step. The important nitrilium ion intermediate detection (m/z 221) was possible due to the presence
of the charge-tagged amine derivative in its structure. The final
Ugi adduct (m/z 343) could be also
detected and characterized using the charge-tagged acid derivative.
Although there were efforts to characterize the intermediate before
the Mumm rearrangement (i.e., imidate), its detection and characterization
was not possible.

The characterization of the imidate ion, a
key intermediate formed
prior to the Mumm rearrangement (Scheme 2), was important to a full characterization
of the mechanism evoked for the Ugi MCR. This step was found to be
strongly exothermic in nature, and the Ugi reaction was likely driven
by the thermodynamics associated with this last transformation, as
suggested elsewhere.7 The solvent also
has an important influence over the rearrangement, and protic solvents
may participate in two different manners:7,10 (i)
the activation of the imidate substrate by acting as H-bond donors
and (ii) by facilitating the acyl transfer during the rearrangement.

A recent landmark study reported by De Angelis and co-workers11 provided an interesting approach to the characterization
of the imidate intermediate (Scheme 2). The use of ESI-MS(/MS) coupled with infrared multiphoton
dissociation (IRMPD) ion spectroscopy and DFT calculations allowed
for the characterization of the retro-Mumm adduct, that is, the imidate
intermediate (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Retro-Mumm Rearrangement As Depicted by ESI-MS(/MS), IRMPD,
and DFT
Calculations
The basis for this
work was found in a previously reported study12 where the MS data pointed to the idea of a reversible
Mumm rearrangement (Scheme 6). The set of techniques applied to characterize the imidate
structure revealed that the iminium ion, observed in the MS spectra,
was a fragment from the retro-Mumm reaction (i.e., the imidate intermediate)
but not from the Ugi multicomponent adduct. The authors tested 14
different substrates, and three of them returned relatively high abundance
for the MS/MS structural characterization associated with structural
simplicity to better IRMPD information. DFT calculations shed some
light over the mechanism of fragmentation and pointed to the accuracy
of the proposition shown in Scheme 5.

Scheme 6 Suggested Reversible Mumm Rearrangement and the Expected
MS/MS Fragmentation
of the Two Adducts
The presented established
view on the Ugi reaction mechanism, with
the iminium (or imine) intermediate as the splitting point (see Scheme 3), has been however
questioned a few years ago.7 Instead of
the isocyanide addition to this intermediate, the possibility of the
carboxylic acid insertion to afford the hemiaminal intermediate has
been proposed. Comparable insertions may be found when isocyanide
chemistry is evaluated,13 but the detailed
theoretical study disclosed elsewhere7 revealed
the crucial role of H-bonds (between the imine intermediate and the
carboxylic acid) to activate the imine structure to shift the reaction
toward the imidate intermediate (Scheme 7), which in turn undergoes the Mumm rearrangement.
Similar results were computed when Ugi–Smiles was investigated
in the same work.7

Scheme 7 Calculated Reaction
Pathway of the Ugi Reaction Considering Methanol
(Purple Values) and Toluene (Black Values) As Solvents
In opposition to the classical view of the Ugi MCR mechanism,
the
mechanism evaluation suggested that an iminium intermediate is not
involved in both media. It is also found to be nonionic when computed
in toluene. In protic solvent, that is, when computed in methanol,
the proton transfer step may also be mediated by the solvent itself.
Two solvent molecules may also be invoked to explain the further Mumm
rearrangement (Scheme 8),7 and these results are in accordance
with some experimental evidence we have disclosed elsewhere.6 When one molecule of methanol is used as the
explicit solvent,6 similar results are
obtained, but the energetic barrier is higher than when two molecules
were computed.

Scheme 8 Calculated Reaction Pathway of the Ugi Reaction Mumm
Rearrangement
Step Considering Two Explicit Methanol Molecules (Computed Solvent)
Later,12 it was found
that the reagents’
structures may also play a role in the reaction pathway selection,
but the hemiaminal intermediate (see Scheme 3) was not detected at all, even when benzoic
acid was used in large excess in a solution containing the preformed
iminium ion aiming at forcing this intermediate formation to further
MS(/MS) detection and characterization. Based on the obtained results,
the authors suggested this mechanism should be definitely rejected.
These results12 proved to be in accordance
with the results previously published by some of us.6 Some theoretical results12 also
pointed to the isocyanide addition affording the nitrilium intermediate
as the rate-determining step of the Ugi MCR.

Enantioselective Ugi Multicomponent
Reaction Mechanism
The challenge for effective chiral induction
and control in MCRs
is huge, as we have recently highlighted.14 The development of efficient methodologies is intimately associated
with both the comprehension of the mechanism of a specific reaction
and the way to tune the parameters (solvent, temperature, etc.) to
further the transformation.

The Ugi MCR has been recently labeled
as “unconquered”15 regarding
an effective enantioselective version,
meaning there is much room for improvement in this field of research.
Mechanistic studies with convincing experimental and theoretical data,
of enantioselective MCRs, are rarely found in the scientific literature,
but there are a few exceptions, as we have recently published.14,16 A breakthrough work in this field has been recently reported by
Zhang and co-workers17 evaluating the enantioselective
Ugi MCR using asymmetric phosphoric acid derivatives as catalysts
(Scheme 9).

Scheme 9 Enantioselective
Ugi Reaction Catalyzed by Chiral Phosphoric Acids
In the work, some chemical tests were conducted to get
insights
into the reaction mechanism and the role of the catalysts in the enantioselective
Ugi MCR. Using amine excess (2 equiv; see Scheme 9), the reaction did not proceed. It pointed
out an important feature of the catalyst action, implying the chiral
phosphoric acid itself was responsible to promote the reaction. It
meant no phosphate-conjugated base or any other deprotonated derivative
was involved in the transformation. The early imine (iminium) formation
was found to be as initially suggested by us,6 and similar results regarding yields and enantiomeric excesses have
been noted in both the three- (using preformed imine) and four-component
versions. A heterodimer, formed by treating the chiral phosphoric
derivative with the carboxylic acid reagent, has been proposed to
act as the species responsible for imine activation (Figure 1). Activation of carboxylic
acids by heterodimerization with chiral phosphoric acids has already
been proposed and explained elsewhere.18

Figure 1 (Left)
Proposed heterodimerization with chiral phosphoric acids
for the activation of carboxylic acids. (Right) Imine activation from
the heterodimer formed between the chiral phosphoric acid and the
used carboxylic acid reagent affording a heterotrimer complex.

DFT calculations supported the proposed scenario
and gave the grounds
to understand the reaction outcomes using the chiral catalysts tested
in their work.17 Based on the theoretical
evaluation of the enantioselective Ugi MCR, a reaction mechanism and
the involved energetics were depicted (Scheme 10). The importance of noncovalent interactions
during the transition state to an efficient chiral transmission and
to succeed the transformation was also highlighted. An in-depth analysis
of the importance of noncovalent interactions, especially during the
transition state of the chiral transmission step for enantioselective
MCRs, may be found elsewhere.14

Scheme 10 Enantioselective
Ugi Reaction Catalyzed by Chiral Phosphoric Acids
and the Calculated Relative Energies Involved in the MCR
Ugi MCR to Generate Functional Chromophores
In the past few years, MCRs have been used as a powerful tool for
the generation of libraries of functional chromophores.2 Two distinct strategies applied in the synthesis
of such functional chromophores are observed (Scheme 11) using MCRs: (i) the use of one of the
reagents bearing a chromophoric framework (known as scaffold approach)
or (ii) the MCR acts as a chromogenic event, and the final product
displays the features of a chromogenic adduct (known as chromophore
approach).

Scheme 11 Synthesis of Functional Chromophores Employing MCRs
by Two Distinct
Strategies, i.e., the Scaffold and the Chromophore Approaches
This strategy has been used, for instance, in
the synthesis of
14 derivatives of donor–acceptor systems where the phenothiazine
acts as the donor, whereas the 9,10-anthraquinone is the acceptor
moiety (Scheme 12).19

Scheme 12 Synthesis of D–A Systems Employing
the Ugi MCR
The absorption characteristics
of the synthesized compounds have
been evaluated and showed similar behavior to a system lacking electronic
communication with the acceptor moiety in the ground state. In the
excited state a quenching could account for the fast electron transfer
from the donor to the acceptor as depicted by femtosecond spectroscopy.

Fluorescent peptoids obtained from the Ugi four-component reaction
have been synthesized (Scheme 13) using the scaffold approach (Figure 1) and applied as selective probes for bioimaging
applications by our group.20

Scheme 13 Synthesis
of Fluorescent Peptoids Using the Ugi Four-Component Reaction
These four new derivatives shown in Scheme 13 had their photoproperties
evaluated and
their abilities as live cell fluorescence imaging probes verified.
Derivative P4 had a strong affinity for mitochondria and could be
used as a new selective blue emitter to stain these important organelles
(Figure 2).

A close look in the
literature will show the readers a few more
examples21−25 (only five) of functional chromophore derivatives synthesized using
the Ugi MCR applying the scaffold approach. This is a clear indication
of the vast field to be explored in the next years by using these
two approaches (Figure 1). Although the possibilities of photoapplication of these derivatives
may be huge, the limited number of available works found in the scientific
literature highlights that we are still crawling in this area and
also shows a window of opportunities.

Concluding Remarks
The available knowledge of the Ugi four-component reaction is still
very limited, and the most available data are based on the use of
the ESI-MS(/MS) technique. Although the generated information was
highly valuable and shed some important light on the comprehension
of this truncated transformation, there is much to be done yet. Kinetic
data for MCRs are a true challenge to be collected and analyzed, and
no data are available for the Ugi four-component reaction. The current
available reports indicate the preferential reaction pathway is through
the nitrilium ion after the imine (or iminium) formation. The formation
of the hemiaminal intermediate is still controversial, and its proper
characterization is a gap to be filled. The imidate intermediate,
formed immediately before the Mumm rearrangement, requires additional
characterization, and most information available is because of the
retro-Mumm reaction monitored by MS and IRMPD. Thus, it is fair to
conclude we know so little about this MCR, and most of their mechanistic
steps are urging for deep investigations and characterizations.

When the few enantioselective versions of the Ugi four-component
reactions are considered, the lack of knowledge is enormous. Beyond
the characterization of the preferred reaction pathway, it is important
to understand the key step of the chiral transmission and to control
the factors ruling this phase. Without this knowledge, the development
of new and efficient catalytic systems is being hindered.

The
few examples found in the literature showing the synthesis
and application of functional fluorophores obtained by the Ugi MCR
exemplify the vast field of opportunities available for new, creative,
and innovative ideas. The “photo” field of technology
has a lot of opportunities, and the development of Ugi adducts applying
the two approaches (i.e., scaffold and chromophore) may allow for
the improvement and tuning of absorption/emissive properties as well
as biological responses, especially considering the large number of
compounds which may be synthesized by this important MCR.

With
this mini-review we hope to help readers to dive in this field
of research, and we are looking forward to reading the new advances
regarding the mechanistic elucidation and the photoapplication of
the Ugi four-component reaction derivatives.
