Mechanism of the
addition of molecular oxygen on the dienolic form of the 2-alkylidene-1,3-cyclohexadione
was investigated by quantum chemical calculations using the approximate
projection method developed by Yamaguchi. The complete reaction pathway
of the formation of the endoperoxide is described. The crossing between
triplet and singlet potential energy surfaces has been located. A
multireference complete active space self-consistent field calculation
has been performed to strengthen the results.

Introduction
G3 factor is a natural
endoperoxide extracted from the leaves of Eucalyptus
grandis, where it plays the role of phytohormones
and a growth regulator.1 Modifications
of its structure afforded new endoperoxides with interesting antimalarial
properties.2 The synthesis of G3 factor
and its analogues is based on a biomimetic spontaneous oxygen uptake
on the enedione in equilibrium with its ketodienolic form (Scheme 1). The autoxidation
occurs in mild conditions, at room temperature, without photoactivation,
whatever the solvent used, also in solid state and in the dark, and
is quantitative and selective.3 Previous
studies have shown the implication of fundamental oxygen in its triplet
state 3∑–g –
O2 and have discarded the alternative of a radical reaction.4 This spin-forbidden reaction constitutes the
key step to prepare endoperoxides with antimalarial properties and
an alternative green process. To elucidate the mechanism of this intriguing
reaction, a precedent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)/spin-trapping
study combined with mass spectroscopy has been undertaken, using two
spin traps and starting from the precursors labeled with 13C in different positions.5 For instance,
when the 13C-labeled precursor was incubated with dioxygen
during 1 h in the presence of the nitrone (TN),6 the EPR spectrum given in Figure 1 was recorded. Its simulation allowed us
to undoubtedly identify the radical center in the intermediate detected,
and its structure was confirmed by the tandem mass spectrometry analysis.
The whole spin-trapping study highlighted the presence of the diradical
species within a mechanism in which pathway I (named pathway B in
ref (5)) was implicated
(Scheme 1).

Figure 1 EPR signal
obtained in benzene after 1 h of reaction between molecular
oxygen and precursor (0.2 mol dm–3) in the presence
of TN (80 mmol dm–3). The superimposed simulation
(red dotted lines) led to the following values for the hyperfine coupling
constants: aN = 1.55 mT, aH = 0.19 mT, aP = 4.25 mT,
and a13C = 1.14 mT.

Scheme 1 To gain an insight into the mechanism of addition
of dioxygen with
dienol, a computational approach was employed. The calculations are
performed on the simplified 2-alkylidene-1,3-cyclohexadione in equilibrium
with its ketodienol form, which is also subject to autoxidation (Scheme 2).7

Scheme 2 The addition of a triplet dioxygen on a singlet
dienol will be
considered, furnishing a triplet diradical. Because the reactants
taken together have a triplet potential energy surface (PES), whereas
the endoperoxide product resides on a singlet potential energy surface,
a triplet–singlet interconversion must occur at some point
along the reaction coordinates. In this way, a change in multiplicity
from triplet to open-shell singlet of the obtained diradical is necessary
to finally obtain the closed-shell singlet endoperoxide. It is worth
noting that the crossing between triplet and singlet potential energy
surfaces arises and has to be located. We report herein a density
functional theory (DFT) study of the complete pathway leading to bicyclic-hemiketal
endoperoxides.

Computational Method
Gaussian 09
was used for all of the computations and analytical
frequencies were calculated for all of the stationary points.8 The energy of the singlet diradical after correction
of the spin contamination was provided by the approximate spin projection
method developed by Yamaguchi.9 The spin-corrected
energy value, 1ESC, can be
obtained as follows    1EUB is the
singlet energy computed at the UB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) (using
“guess = mix”) and 3EUB is the triplet energy computed at the UB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p).

This method was also applied by Bendikov to describe the Diels–Alder
reaction of acenes with singlet and triplet oxygen using the density
functional theory. He has shown that B3LYP performs reasonably well
for diradicals.10 He used this spin-projected
UB3LYP method that revealed to be of interest in modeling triplet
and open-shell singlet biradical ground state, and nicely reproduces
the singlet–triplet splitting for oxygen. In addition, recently,
Tantillo has used the DFT with Yamaguchi method to study the intramolecular
(2 + 2) cycloaddition reaction, which involves the diradical intermediates
from zwitterionic transition state structures.11

As a result, we decided to use the DFT calculations
with restricted
B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)12 and unrestricted broken
symmetry UB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) levels for all of the closed-shell and
open-shell species, respectively, to study the spontaneous oxygen
uptake on the dienol precursor.13 Structures
of the singlet diradicals were optimized at the UB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)
level with the broken symmetry method (initial guess ⟨S2⟩ = 1) and the structures of the triplet
state of diradicals were calculated with the unrestricted method (initial
guess ⟨S2⟩ = 2). Spin-projected
energies were used throughout this paper. To further explore the validity
of our results, a multireference complete active space self-consistent
field (CASSCF)(8/8)/6-31G(d) calculation was also performed on some
points chosen along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC).

Solvent effects were not investigated, as the autoxidation occurred
with or without a solvent.

Results
The different conformations
of the singlet ground state dienol
were first calculated (see the Supporting Information) and the lowest one’s geometry was retained. The addition
of a triplet oxygen 3∑–g – O2 on the dienol can afford three possibilities
of geometries in each pathway (A and B). Three triplet minima were
found for the pathway noted 3M1–3 and
only two for pathway II noted 3M4 and 3M5. Despite our efforts, no minimum could be found for
M6, for which the initial guess always converged to M4 or M5 geometries. Triplet enthalpies (au) and
the relative enthalpies (kcal/mol) with respect to the starting material 3(dienol + O2) are given in Table 1.

M1–6 and the Singlet Spin-Corrected Enthalpy of

a Calculated with
the approximate
spin-correction procedure proposed by Yamaguchi computed at the UB3LYP
6-311+G(d,p).

From all of
the minima, 3M2, the lowest in
energy was located at 19.5 kcal/mol higher than the ground state of
the starting material 3(dienol + O2). The relative
enthalpies for 3M1 and 3M3 were, respectively, located at 21.6 and 26.3 kcal/mol. This last
value is quite high (7 kcal/mol higher than that of 3M2) and could be explained by the destabilizing Pauli repulsion.
So, the research of the transition states were first carried on between
both 3M1 and 3(dienol + O2) and then 3M2 and 3(dienol + O2) and are, respectively, noted 3TS1 and 3TS2. They were, respectively, found at 24.0 and
21.7 kcal/mol higher than the ground state (Table 2). These transition states are characterized
by only one imaginary frequency at, respectively, −361.6 and
−299.96 cm–1, which are both along the reaction
coordinates of the C–O bond formation. 3TS2 is located below the other minima and below 3TS1. As a consequence, the research of other transition states was not
further investigated. Using the approximate spin-correction procedure,
the enthalpy of the singlet diradical 1M2 was
found to be very close in energy to the triplet structure (only 0.5
kcal/mol higher). The singlet 1M2 with the same
geometry as the triplet 3M2 was also a minimum,
as its optimized geometry stays unchanged (ΔH less than 0.01 kcal/mol) with no negative frequency. Therefore,
singlet and triplet states could be considered as degenerated. The
conditions are fulfilled for the intersystem crossing, allowing the
possibility that the reaction pathway continues on the singlet potential
energy surface, finally leading to endoperoxide. The crossing between
triplet and singlet potential energy surfaces will be studied in the
area of the reaction pathway (Figure 2).

Enthalpies of Transition States 1TS2 and 1TSform between, Respectively (1Δg – O2, Dienol), and 1M2 and 1M2 and Endoperoxide
Futhermore, on the singlet potential energy,
we found on the singlet
potential energy surface, the transition state 1TS2, which relies
(1Δg – O2, dienol) to 1M2 with a relative activation enthalpy of 25.3
kcal/mol, a significantly higher barrier than for 3TS2 on the triplet surface. This result is in good agreement
with the experimental facts in favor of the implication of fundamental
oxygen during this autoxidation.

Continuing on the singlet potential
energy surface, the transition
state (1TSform) between 1M2 and endoperoxide was located at 22.8 kcal/mol above the ground state
(and lying only 3 kcal/mol above 1M2).

An intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs) calculation14 was performed to connect both the transition
state 1TSform with the endoperoxide in the reverse
direction and the minimum 1M2 in the forward
direction on the singlet potential energy surface. The results are
consigned in Figure 3. To characterize the singlet diradical character along the reaction
coordinate before the closing of the ring, the ⟨S2⟩ value was reported versus IRC points. The ⟨S2⟩ value of 1.0 in the DFT calculations
indicates an equal mixture of singlet (⟨S2⟩ = 0) and triplet (⟨S2⟩ = 2). This value of 1 is expected for singlet open-shell
diradical structures. At the onset of the closing, the transition
state 1TSform in its singlet state possesses
a diradical character with a ⟨S2⟩ value of approximately 1; this value then quickly decreases
as the peroxide bond is formed. It is worth noting that a singlet
PES is very flat as long as ⟨S2⟩ ≠ 0 and becomes steep as soon as ⟨S2⟩ = 0. The following reaction consists
of the reorganization of all of the structure, leading to endoperoxide,
with a ⟨S2⟩ value of 0,
indicating no more diradical character. We have verified that optimization
of the last IRC points in both directions converged to endoperoxide
in the reverse direction and to M2 in the forward direction.

connecting the transition state TSform to
the two minima M2 and the endoperoxide on the singlet potential
energy surface (1EUB). Singlet
energies vs reaction coordinate plots are shown in blue, single points
triplet energies (3EUB) in
red, and singlet ⟨S2⟩ values
vs reaction coordinate plots in green.

Single points energy calculations were also performed on
the IRC
points with an enforced triplet state using UB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p), which
furnishes the triplet electronic energy versus the reaction coordinates
curve. We can observe in Figure 3 the crossing of the triplet and singlet pathways located
between M2 and TSform. To further explore the
validity of our results, a multireference calculation at the CASSCF(8,8)
level15 was also performed on five chosen
geometries on the singlet PES, 1–5, in both singlet and triplet states. The occupation numbers of the
eight orbitals of the active space are given in Table 3 for the singlet and the triplet state. In
the singlet state, orbitals 53 and 54 are singly occupied for point 1 (M2) to point 3 (TSform), expressing the open-shell character at the onset of closing, then
the occupation number increases for orbital 53 and decreases for orbital
54 (points 4 and 5) until the formation
of the C–O bond. These results strengthen our previous calculations
at the UB3LYP level using Yamaguchi’s method. The ⟨S2⟩ value of ≈1.0 (equal mixture
of singlet and triplet) found for points 1–3, characterizing singlet open-shell diradical structures,
is well correlated with the occupation numbers of orbital 53 and 54.
Then ⟨S2⟩ decreases to 0
(0.675 for point 4 and 0 for point 5), characterizing
closed-shell structures. Concomitantly, the two electrons fill the
orbital 53 and orbital 54 becomes empty, indicating no more diradical character. As can be seen from Figure 4, orbital 53 of point 5 with the occupation number of 1.8 in its singlet state shows
the C–O bond formation. For the triplet state of point 5, the energy of one singly occupied orbital drops below that
of a doubly occupied orbital. Thus, for this point only, orbitals
52 and 54 are singly occupied. Yet, as can be seen from their shapes
in the Supporting Information, they do
correspond to orbitals 53 and 54 of the four previous points (1–4).

Conclusions
A
plausible reaction pathway of the autoxidation of the ketodienol
has been investigated by using the unrestricted B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)
level of theory, which appears to perform well for diradicals using
the spin-projected Yamaguchi’s method and the results have
been strengthened by the CASSCF(8,8) calculations. We theoretically
demonstrated that the oxygen uptake occurred between singlet dienol
and fundamental triplet dioxygen following pathway I, with an overall
barrier reaching 22.8 kcal/mol. The crossing between triplet and singlet
PES has been located. This computational study is in good agreement
with the experimental reaction conditions and our previous spin trap
experiments. The DFT method, low in cost, seems convenient to qualitatively
describe the autoxidation.
