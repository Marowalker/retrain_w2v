We
develop a temperature-programmed pretreatment strategy for converting
aliphatic-rich petroleum pitch into a mesophase framework, which can
then be activated using KOH to produce high-performance carbons for
electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). In the pretreatment of pitch
at an optimal temperature, both the temperature ramp and holding time
influence the mesophase structure, which governs the pore structure
and crystallinity of the resulting activated carbon. High carbon microporosity
is beneficial to capacitance maximization but detrimental to ion transport.
To resolve this problem, we develop a multistep ramp incorporating
aliphatic species into the aromatic framework during mesophase formation.
This incorporation process produces a mesophase framework that can
be activated to form carbons with high crystallinity, thereby enhancing
electronic conductivity and hierarchical porosity, which improves
ionic conductivity. The resulting carbon electrode is used to assemble
a symmetric EDLC, which exhibits a capacitance of 160 F g–1 and excellent high-rate retention in a propylene carbonate solution
of N,N-diethyl-N-methylethanaminium tetrafluoroborate. The EDLC delivers a superior
specific energy of 40 Wh kg–1 (based on the total
carbon mass) within a voltage range of 0–2.7 V and sustained
a high energy of 24 Wh kg–1 at a high power of 50
kW kg–1. The findings of this study demonstrate
that incorporating aliphatic species into aromatic mesophase frameworks
plays a crucial role in regulating the crystallinity and pore structure
of pitch-derived carbons for charge storage.

1 Introduction
Electric
double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) have attracted considerable
attention as auxiliary high-power sources for rechargeable batteries
and fuel cells.1−5 In an EDLC, a double layer can be rapidly formed at the electrode–electrolyte
interface; thus, an EDLC exhibits a higher charge–discharge
rate relative to that of a battery that requires ions to travel over
long distances in solid-state electrodes.1−3 According to
the mechanism underlying double-layer formation, a larger electrode
surface area for electrolyte adsorption enables the achievement of
greater energy storage capacity in an EDLC. Therefore, activated carbons
(ACs) with large surface areas and high porosity levels are strong
candidate materials for EDLC polarizable electrodes.1,2 Porous carbons can be fabricated by etching carbon precursors during
thermal treatment for carbonization. Graphitizable hydrocarbon materials,
such as pitch, constitute an ideal precursor for the production of
porous carbons that possess high electronic conductivity.6 Studies have reported the efficacy of pitch activation
for producing high-porosity carbons that can serve as electrodes for
EDLCs.7−11 In addition to porosity, pore geometry is essential for rapid energy
delivery because it facilitates ion transport in the interior of carbons.6 Developing a strategy to manipulate the pore
structure of carbons derived from graphitizable materials (such as
pitch) is critical for promoting the applicability of EDLCs.

Pitch refers to high-molecular-weight residues derived from coal
and petroleum refineries. Pitch derived from coal tar has higher aromatic/aliphatic
and elemental C/H ratios than does that derived from petroleum.12 Both types of pitch primarily comprise polycyclic
aromatic units such as anthracene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, but petroleum
pitch has high concentrations of naphthene and alkyl side chains,
which are prone to volatilization during pitch carbonization.12 Although carbons are formed through the coalescence
of aromatic rings, the structure of carbons may be affected by the
transformation patterns of naphthene and alkyl side chains during
pitch carbonization. Capitalizing on its high concentrations of naphthene
and alkyl side chains, we used petroleum pitch as the precursor for
producing ACs; thus, we manipulated the carbon structure for effective
ion transport and charge storage.

ACs are typically derived
from their precursors by using heat treatment
for carbonization along with etching for porosity development.13−17 Etching can be achieved through either gasification in oxidizing
gases or interaction with an alkali metal hydroxide impregnated with
a precursor.18−21 In this study, we applied KOH etching to produce ACs by using petroleum
pitch precursors; we preferred alkaline etching to gasification because
the gasification mechanism could not effectively create pores in a
graphitizable carbon framework.8,18−21 In KOH etching, KOH facilitates the cross-linking of constituent
macromolecules to form a rigid matrix that has a low susceptibility
to volatile loss and volume contraction upon heating to high temperatures.22−24 The key mechanisms for pore formation are associated with carbon
gasification by KOH-derived compounds such as K2O and K2CO3, which can be reduced by carbon to form metallic
K to achieve carbon gasification and thus pore formation.21,25,26 The residual K metal can be removed
through acid washing, leading to the formation of small micropores
in the carbon products.

The KOH-derived compounds K2O and K2CO3 can effectively interact with a
carbonaceous framework at
temperatures higher than 500 °C.6 Pretreating
a pitch precursor at temperatures less than 500 °C may be beneficial
for conjugating the macromolecules in the precursor to suppress volatile
evolution during heating. In addition, a controlled pretreatment process
may result in a mesophase with an ordered arrangement of constituent
macromolecules. Such a mesophase is beneficial for creating graphitic
crystallites during carbonization, thereby achieving high electronic
conductivity. The naphthene and alkyl side chains in petroleum pitch
can be useful in the construction of a mesophase pitch framework to
produce desired porous carbons; alternatively, they can be decomposed
into volatiles during pretreatment.

The present study devised
a temperature-programmed pretreatment
strategy for manipulating the structure of mesophase pitch. We developed
a staged heating strategy that entailed first applying low temperatures
to generate local aggregates surrounded by naphthene and alkyl side
chains and then applying increased temperatures to combine the aggregates
for the formation of a hierarchically structured mesophase. When the
derived mesophase pitch was subjected to KOH etching, it was transformed
into an AC framework that had a high graphitic content for electron
conduction as well as suitable proportions of mesopores and micropores
for ion transport and storage. Compared to template-synthesized27−29 or graphene-based30,31 porous carbons that also contained
nanostructured mesopores and micropores, our pitch-derived AC presents
promising readiness in industry-scale production. The developed AC
electrodes were used to assemble a symmetric EDLC in which 1 M N,N-diethyl-N-methylethanaminium
tetrafluoroborate (TEMABF4) in propylene carbonate (PC)
solvent was the electrolyte solution. The carbon electrodes exhibited
a specific capacitance of 160 F g–1, which was superior
to the reported value of 80–130 F g–1 for
carbon electrodes in organic electrolytes.32−35 The EDLC delivered an ultimate
specific energy of 40 Wh kg–1 (based on the total
carbon mass), within a voltage range of 0–2.7 V, and sustained
a high energy of 24 Wh kg–1 at a high power of 50
kW kg–1. The findings of this study demonstrate
the feasibility of our simple temperature-programmed pretreatment
strategy for converting petroleum pitch into a hierarchically structured
mesophase, which can be etched using KOH etching to produce a high-performance
AC for EDLCs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characteristics of Pitch Precursors and Resulting
ACs
We derived porous carbons from petroleum pitch samples
by using KOH as the activation reagent. The pitch samples were subjected
to thermal pretreatment to incorporate the constituent molecules,
thereby suppressing volatilization and promoting the yield of porous
carbons in the subsequent activation process. The thermal pretreatment
process resulted in the formation of an ordered mesophase, which was
determined to be suitable to graphitic domain growth with additional
increases in temperature. Our auxiliary experiments indicated that
430 °C was the optimal temperature for obtaining a high carbon
yield through pitch activation. We varied the heating rate and isothermal
(430 °C) holding time to devise a temperature program for producing
an ideal mesophase structure for activation into porous carbons exhibiting
high capacitive performance.

Figure 1 presents examples of the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) profiles observed for the as-received pitch samples
subjected to thermal pretreatment through the use of different ramp
processes. The resulting pitch samples were designated as P-x-y, where P represents the pitch sample, x represents the heating rate (°C min–1), and y represents the holding time (h) at 430
°C. For example, P-2-1 represents the pitch sample obtained using
a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 and a holding
time of 1 h at 430 °C. For the multistage heating process, we
heated the samples at a rate of 2 °C min–1 to
100 and 200 °C, maintained each of these temperatures for 0.5
h, continued heating to 430 °C, and finally maintained this temperature
for 1 h; the resulting pitch sample was designated as P-m. Figure 1a presents the weight
loss profiles of P-2-1. Weight loss was observed at 100–200
°C and attributed to the evaporation of adsorbed water. Weight
loss was also observed at 200–430 °C and attributed to
the decomposition of volatile hydrocarbon species, which may have
primarily comprised naphthene and alkyl side chains.12 The weight loss profiles observed for the samples subjected
to the other single-step ramp procedures are presented in Figure S1; the total weight loss from volatile
hydrocarbon decomposition of these samples was approximately 40 wt
%. Polarization microscopic analysis (Figure S2a) indicated that the thermal pretreatment resulted in the formation
of a mesophase framework from the pitch.

Figure 1 TGA profiles for the
thermal pretreatment on the as-received pitch
to produce different mesophase pitch samples: (a) P-2-1 and (b) P-m.

Figure 1b presents
the weight loss profiles of the samples subjected to the multistage
heating process, which substantially reduced the total weight loss
from volatile hydrocarbon decomposition of the sample to approximately
16 wt %. The holding processes performed at 100 and 200 °C may
have led to the interaction between the aliphatic and aromatic species,
which suppressed the evolution of volatiles at 200–430 °C. Figure S2b depicts the polarization microscopic
image of P-m, which reveals the formation of a streamlined mesophase
framework. The incorporation of aliphatic species may have hindered
the coalescence of the ordered mesophase domains, resulting in the
formation of a streamlined framework comprising mesophase domains
intersected by aliphatic borders.

The as-received and pretreated
pitch samples were impregnated with
KOH and carbonized at 800 °C to produce ACs. Similar to the derived
pitch samples, the ACs were designated as AC-x-y, where AC represents the carbon derived from the corresponding
pitch precursor, x represents the heating rate for
the corresponding pitch precursor, and y represents
the holding time. For example, AC-2-1 represents the AC produced from
the activation of P-2-1. The carbon produced from the as-received
pitch was designated as as-AC. Figure 2 shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of as-AC and AC-m. Both porous carbons exhibited an amorphous
framework with a distribution of interconnected nanochannels that
were interstices between turbostratic graphene sheets and clusters.36−38 The high concentration of nanochannels in the carbons signifies
that the KOH activation process engendered high porosity in the resulting
carbons. The structure of as-AC (Figure 2a) was determined to be highly isotropic,
whereas the framework of AC-m (Figure 2b) exhibited local molecular ordering, thus forming
graphitic crystallites. These TEM results are consistent with the
results obtained from comparing selected-area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns (insets of Figure 2). Specifically, the SAED pattern of AC-m demonstrated
clear diffraction rings on the graphitic planes of this carbon, whereas
that of as-AC did not reveal any diffraction ring within the carbon
structure.

Figure 2 TEM images of (a) as-AC and (b) AC-m. The insets of the TEM images
show the selected-area electron diffraction patterns.

Figure S3 shows the TEM images
and SAED
patterns of the carbons derived from the other pitch samples. All
pitch pretreatment processes induced crystallization during the subsequent
carbonization process; this is because TEM revealed the presence of
local crystallites and diffraction rings in the carbons. The presence
of crystallites in the carbons can be attributed to the formation
of the mesophase framework from the pitch precursors. A comparison
of all SAED patterns revealed that AC-m exhibited additional diffraction
rings, which were assigned to the (103) and (201) planes, indicating
that the multistep pretreatment process engendered a pitch framework
that was susceptible to graphitic crystallite formation during the
activation process.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the ACs (Figure S4) were determined to
support the TEM results. Specifically,
the XRD pattern of as-AC did not exhibit a diffraction peak, indicating
a highly amorphous structure. By contrast, the pattern of the ACs
derived from the pretreated pitch precursors exhibited a broad diffraction
peak at a 2θ value of approximately 25°, which was attributed
to the graphitic (002) plane with an interlayer spacing larger than
that of graphite (2θ = 26.6°); this result demonstrates
the effectiveness of the thermal pretreatment of the pitch in promoting
the stacking of the graphene layers of the resulting ACs. Compared
with the 2θ values of the other ACs, the 2θ value of AC-m
(25.3°) was closer to that of graphite, indicating that AC-m
had a higher degree of graphitization relative to the other ACs. In
addition, the crystallite size of AC-m, estimated from the full width
at half-maximum of the (002) peak, was larger than those of the other
ACs (Table S1), confirming that the multistep
pretreatment process was superior to the other pretreatment processes
in promoting crystallinity during activation.

Figure S5 illustrates the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the ACs. The isotherms
of the ACs exhibited fairly horizontal plateaus and were thus determined
to be typical of microporous carbons.39−42 Compared with the isotherm of
as-AC, the isotherms of the ACs derived from the pretreated pitch
precursors exhibited wide knees, indicating that the pitch pretreatment
process resulted in a large micropore size distribution. Increasing
the heating rate and maintaining the treatment temperature (at 430
°C) for 1 h (Figure S5b– d for
AC-x-1, where x = 1.5, 2, or 5)
resulted in an increase in adsorption at a P/P0 of >0.2; this result signifies that a high
heating rate increased the formation of large micropores and mesopores.
When the heating rate was 5 °C min–1, extending
the holding time (at 430 °C) from 1 to 2 h (Figure S5d,e for AC-5-y, where y = 1 or 2) engendered an increase in N2 adsorption at
a P/P0 of <0.25, but
the total adsorption capacity remained unchanged; this result indicates
that extending the holding time at 430 °C promoted micropore
formation but suppressed mesopore formation. When the heating rate
was 2 °C min–1, inserting two low-temperature
treatment steps at 100 and 200 °C resulted in an increase in
adsorption capacity throughout the P/P0 range (Figure S5f for AC-m),
signifying that the multistep treatment process promoted both micropore
and mesopore formation.

The isotherms revealed that the AC-m
sample exhibited hysteresis
at P/P0 values of >0.3
(Figure S5f, inset) but the other carbons
did not. For AC-m, the adsorption and desorption branches of the hysteresis
loop of the isotherm were horizontal and parallel to each other, which
is typical of a type-IV hysteresis phenomenon.38 We determined that AC-m was characterized by a hierarchical
pore structure in which mesopores served as the main channels for
molecular transport and micropores located in the mesopore walls accommodated
molecules (see the AC derived from the pitch subjected to multistep
pretreatment in Scheme 1).43−46 The other carbons that exhibited no hysteresis comprised mesopores
at the pore entrance and micropores within the carbon particles (see
the AC derived from the pitch subjected to single-step pretreatment
in Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic
Illustration of the Possible Mechanisms for the Synthesis
of the ACs Using Different Pitch Pretreatment Steps
(a) Single-step pretreatment;
(b) multistep pretreatment.

The realistic
total surface area (St), total pore volume
(Vt), and pore size
distribution of the ACs were derived from a simulation of N2 sorption data by using a two-dimensional nonlocal density functional
theory model for carbons with heterogeneous surfaces (HS-2D-NLDFT).39−42Figure S6 and Table 1 present the simulated results and corresponding
values. Although the conventional Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation is unsuitable for analyzing microporous carbons, for
comparison, we applied the equation to derive the surface area (SBET) of the ACs; the results are presented in Table 1. All ACs had high St and SBET values
(approximately 1900 and 2500 m2 g–1,
respectively), reflecting the effectiveness of the KOH activation
process. The St values were primarily
contributed by the micropore area (Smi), which predominantly determines the energy storage capacity of
a sample.38,47−49 We observed that the
pretreatment pattern affected the micropore/mesopore volume ratio.
When the pretreatment holding time was 1 h (at 430 °C), reducing
the heating rate from 5 to 1.5 °C min–1 resulted
in decreased Vt, decreased mesopore fraction,
and increased microporosity of the resulting ACs. Micropores typically
have a higher contribution to the surface area per unit volume than
do mesopores.34 Therefore, the ACs derived
at a low heating rate exhibited high St and Smi values even if they had a low Vt value. Regarding the effect of the holding
time at 430 °C, when the heating rate was 5 °C min–1, increasing the holding time from 1 to 2 h increased the micropore
proportion at the expense of the mesopore proportion, but the Vt value remained unchanged (Table 1).

Based on the aforementioned
pore characteristics, Scheme 1 proposes the possible mechanism
underlying the formation of the ACs; the purpose of the scheme is
to elucidate the effect of the pretreatment procedure on the structure
of the pitch precursors and subsequently on the structure of the ACs.
When the as-received pitch samples were subjected to single-step heating
to 430 °C (process (a) of Scheme 1), the pitch molecules rearranged to form a framework
consisting of merged mesophase domains partitioned by interstitial
boundaries. Polarization microscopy (Figure S2a) revealed the formation of stacked mesophase domains after the single-step
heating process. When the pitch samples were impregnated with KOH
for activation, the mesophase domains were attacked by KOH on the
basal plane, leading to the creation of wedge-like channels in which
the near-entrance region corresponded to mesopores.6,38,50 Some interstitial boundaries were transformed
into mesopores after high-temperature activation. The K+ ions intercalated in the lamellar structure of the mesophase domains,
resulting in the formation of micropores after the removal of K species
through acid washing.6 As revealed in Table 1, reducing the heating
rate or increasing the holding time at 430 °C for the pitch led
the resulting ACs to exhibit increased Smi and substantially decreased mesopore volume possibly because of
the elimination of interstitial boundaries. An increase in Smi is beneficial to the process of energy storage
in ACs, but the elimination of mesopores hinders ion transport and
is detrimental to the power performance of ACs. We observed that compared
with the ACs obtained from the pretreated pitch, the as-AC sample
exhibited low mesoporosity, which can be attributed to the lack of
mesophase domains and interstices for mesopore formation. Additionally,
the yield of the as-AC from KOH activation was low because of the
lack of mesophase formation that suppressed the evolution of volatiles.
The as-AC was not subjected to further electrochemical analysis. The
porosity data in Table 1 demonstrate the critical role of mesophase domains in creating mesoporosity
during pitch activation into porous carbon.

In the multistep
heating process, heating at low temperatures (100
and 200 °C) resulted in long-range molecular ordering and cross-linking
prior to molecular decomposition (process (b) in Scheme 1). TGA (Figure 1) demonstrated that the low-temperature treatment
process suppressed the evolution of naphthene and alkyl side chains.
When the heating temperature was increased to 430 °C, the pitch
was transformed into a long-range mesophase framework sliced by defected
splits that were composed of naphthene and alkyl side chains. Polarization
microscopy (Figure S2b) demonstrated that
multistep heating transformed the pitch into a basin-like coalesced
mesophase framework. After activation with KOH at high temperatures,
the resulting AC (i.e., AC-m) exhibited a high Smi value, which was attributed to the activation of the mesophase
domains, and high mesoporosity, which was attributed to the defected
splits in the pitch framework. The high mesoporosity of AC-m may facilitate
ion transport for increasing the power rate of the resulting EDLC.51,52

In addition to pore structure regulation, multistep heating
increased
the crystallinity of AC-m, according to the TEM and XRD results. We
applied a four-probe method to measure the electronic conductivity
of each of the ACs used as electrodes. The electronic conductivity
values of the AC-1.5-1, AC-2-1, AC-5-1, AC-5-2, and AC-m electrodes
were 18.4, 17.5, 15.4, 18.4, and 23.2 S m–1, respectively.
The conductivity decreased with an increase in the preheating rate
because of the increase in mesopore content. When the heating rate
was 5 °C min–1, increasing the holding time
from 1 to 2 h increased the electronic conductivity; this can be attributed
to the decreased mesopore content. However, the AC-m sample, which
had a high concentration of mesopores, exhibited the highest electronic
conductivity. This high conductivity can be attributed to the high
crystallinity induced by the multistep heating of the pitch precursor
for achieving long-range structural ordering.

2.2 Electrochemical
Performance of ACs
Figure 3 presents
the cyclic voltammograms of symmetric two-electrode cells assembled
using the ACs as the electrode and 1 M TEMABF4/PC as the
electrolyte. The voltammograms were obtained by scanning the cells
at voltage scan rates of 50 and 500 mV s–1. The
voltammograms of the cells scanned at 50 mV s–1 were
rectangular (Figure 3a), indicating that the cells exhibited an ideal capacitive feature
for charge storage.4,5,33 The
AC-5-2 cell exhibited the highest capacitance value, which can be
attributed to its high Smi. Increasing
the voltage scan rate to 500 mV s–1 resulted in
the distortion of the rectangular shape of the voltammograms (Figure 3b), indicating that
charge transport resistance had a strong influence on the charge storage
dynamics of the cells. The increased voltage scan rate had a relatively
low effect on the shape of the voltammogram of the AC-m cell; this
signifies that the high mesopore content and crystallinity of AC-m
facilitated both electron and ion transport in the electrode.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammograms
of symmetric two-electrode cells assembled
using the ACs as the electrodes and 1 M TEMABF4/PC as the electrolyte.
The cells were scanned at different scan rates: (a) 50 mV s–1 and (b) 500 mV s–1.

Figure 4a presents
the voltage–time curves of the symmetric two-electrode cells
charged and discharged at a current density of 0.5 A g–1 and temperature of 25 °C. All galvanostatic charge–discharge
curves revealed standard capacitive characteristics over a voltage
range of 0–2.7 V.33Figure 4b shows the charge–discharge
curves of the AC-m cell obtained at current densities of 0.5–18.75
A g–1. A linear voltage–time relationship
was observed at each current density, demonstrating the high-rate
capability of the AC-m electrode. The specific discharge capacitance
(C) values of the electrodes were calculated using
the charge–discharge data, as presented in the following equation 1  where I is
the discharge current, td is the discharge
time, M is the total carbon mass of the two symmetric
electrodes, and ΔV is the voltage difference
in discharge, excluding IR drop. Figure 4c illustrates the variation of C with a discharge rate. At the lowest discharge current (0.5 A g–1), the ultimate C values obtained
for the AC-1.5-1, AC-2-1, AC-5-1, AC-5-2, and AC-m electrodes were
160, 150, 126, 170, and 160 F g–1, respectively.
We determined that the ultimate C values were primarily
proportional to Smi, which predominantly
contributed to the double-layer capacitance of the carbon electrodes.4,53,54 Reducing the ramp rate and increasing
the holding time at 430 °C for pitch pretreatment resulted in
an increase in Smi, thus increasing the
ultimate capacitance.

cells
assembled using different ACs at a current density of 0.5 A g–1. (b) Voltage–time curves of the AC-m cell
at current densities of 0.5, 7.5, 12.5, and 18.75 A g–1. (c) Variation of the specific capacitance with the specific discharge
current for the ACs. (d) Variation of IR drop with the cell discharge
current for different AC cells.

For each electrode, the derived C value decreased
with the discharge current (Figure 4c) because of ion transport limitations. At the highest
discharge current (100 A g–1), the AC-1.5-1, AC-2-1,
AC-5-1, AC-5-2, and AC-m electrodes exhibited capacitance retention
levels of 61, 61, 65, 57, and 70%, respectively. In principle, pretreating
a pitch precursor to increase the mesoporosity of the resulting ACs
increases the high-rate capacitance retention of the ACs. We determined
that the AC-m electrode exhibited the highest retention, although
its mesopore content was lower than that of the AC-5-1 electrode.
The networked mesopores in AC-m must have facilitated ion transport
for the formation of double layers in the micropores.

Because
IR drop was excluded from the capacitance calculation,
some of the derived retention values were misleading. We evaluated
IR drop in this study. Figure 4d presents the variation of IR drop with a discharge rate.
The IR drop value increased linearly with the discharge rate for each
cell; the slope of this linear relationship was determined to correspond
to the direct current (DC) equivalent series resistance (RDC). Table 2 presents a summary of the RDC values
of the cells. For the cells that were assembled using the ACs obtained
from the pitch samples subjected to single-step heating, the RDC values were primarily an increasing function
of the mesopore content. This result indicates that the electronic
conductivity of the carbon electrodes governed the RDC value of the corresponding cells and that lower electrode
mesoporosity was associated with higher electronic conductivity. The
AC-1.5-1 electrode had the lowest mesoporosity, and its corresponding
cell exhibited the lowest RDC. By contrast,
the RDC value of the AC-m cell, which
was composed of the AC-m electrode with high mesoporosity, was as
low as that of the AC-1.5-1 cell. The high crystallinity and thus
high conductivity of the AC-m electrode must have contributed to the
low RDC of the corresponding cell.

that the vertical lines at low frequencies became increasingly tilted
with the decrease in the mesoporosity of the ACs that were obtained
from the pitch samples subjected to single-step pretreatment; this
finding signifies that the mesopores reduced the charge storage resistance
of the cells. The AC-m cell exhibited the lowest charge storage resistance,
although the AC-m electrode did not have the highest mesoporosity. Figure 5b presents the equivalent
circuit used for the simulation; in this circuit, the electrolyte
resistance in the bulk solution (Rs) and
the charge storage resistance and capacitance in the pores were simulated
using the transmission line (TML) model.56−59 Because of the wide pore size
distribution, we used two parallel TML elements (TML1 and TML2, with
the corresponding pore resistance and capacitance of Rpx and Cpx, respectively, where x = 1 or 2)
to simulate the entire impedance spectra.60−63 TML1 was used to characterize
pores that were easily accessible to electrolytes, whereas TML2 was
used to characterize small or deep pores that might require dissociation
of counterions for penetration.

Table 2 presents
the simulated resistance and capacitance components of the cells.
All cells exhibited similar Rs values
because the same electrolyte was used in the cell assembly. Cp1 primarily contributed to the capacitance
of the cells because the pores characterized by TML1 exhibited considerably
lower resistance levels compared with those characterized by TML2
(i.e., Rp1 ≪ Rp2). For the ACs obtained from the pitch that was subjected
to the single-step pretreatment processes involving a constant holding
time of 1 h, the Cp1 values of the resulting
cells increased as the pretreatment ramp rate decreased; this can
be attributed to the increase in Smi.
However, the Rp1 values decreased as the
ramp rate decreased; this decrease in the ramp rate caused a decrease
in the mesoporosity of the ACs. This result indicates that the electronic
conductivity of the ACs was the governing factor for the value of Rp1. Furthermore, the Rp2 and Cp2 values increased as
the ramp rate decreased; this finding can be attributed to the increase
in microporosity. The preceding results demonstrate that the electronic
conductivity of the ACs governed charge transport in TML1 and that
ion transport resistance governed the dynamics in TML2.

For
the ACs obtained from the pitch subjected to single-step pretreatment
at a ramp rate of 5 °C min–1, both the Cp and Rp values
of the corresponding cells increased when the holding time at 430
°C was increased from 1 to 2 h; the increase can be attributed
to the substantial increase in the microporosity of the electrodes.
The Rp1 value of the AC-5-2 cell was higher
than that of the AC-5-1 cell; an explanation for this finding is that
increasing the holding time engendered a minor increase in electronic
conductivity, as revealed by the IR drop measurements (Figure 4d and Table 2). We observed that the AC-m cell had the
lowest Rp1 and Rp2 values compared with the other cells; this observation can
be attributed to the high electronic conductivity of the AC-m carbon
framework and the hierarchical pore structure that facilitated ion
transport in small pores. Figure S7 presents
the impedance angle values of the cells at varying frequencies based
on the impedance data of Figure 5a. In the low-frequency regime, the AC-m cell exhibits
phase angles closer to −90° (a pure capacitive behavior)5 relative to the angles of the other cells, justifying
the facile ion transport in the AC-m for charge storage.

We
used the galvanostatic discharge data to correlate the specific
power and energy of the two-electrode cells according to eqs 2 and 3 2   3  where E is
the specific energy, and P is the specific power. Figure 6a displays Ragone
plots providing a summary of the E and P data for the cells. The AC-m cell was superior to the other cells
with respect to both E and P; the
cell achieved a maximum E value of 40 Wh kg–1 (based on the total carbon mass) or 20 Wh L–1 (with
a carbon tap density of 0.5 g cm–3) within a voltage
range of 0–2.7 V and sustained an E value
of 24 Wh kg–1 (12 Wh L–1) at a
high P value of 50 kW kg–1 (25
kW L–1). The excellent performance of this cell
can be attributed to the multistep pretreatment of the petroleum pitch
precursor to produce a porous carbon that exhibited high electronic
conductivity and comprised hierarchically structured pores that facilitated
ion transport. To confirm the stability of AC-m, the AC-m cell was
charged and discharged for 20,000 cycles at voltages ranging between
1.35 and 2.7 V and a current density of 5 A g–1.
As shown in Figure 6b, the cell exhibited a high capacitance retention rate
of 91% after the charge and discharge processes, and the Coulombic
efficiency values were nearly 100% throughout the whole cycling; this
result demonstrates the high chemical durability of AC-m as an EDLC
electrode. We developed a strategy for activating pitch with high
concentrations of naphthene and alkyl side chains to produce a high
carbon yield and a carbon framework suitable for ion and electron
transport.

3 Summary and Conclusions
This study
demonstrated that thermal pretreatment of petroleum
pitch for forming mesophase pitch is essential for the production
of ACs through KOH activation. In the pitch pretreatment processes,
the temperature ramp rate and holding time (at 430 °C) significantly
affected the structure of the resulting ACs. Reducing the ramp rate
and increasing the holding time increased the microporosity Smi and ultimate double-layer capacitance of
the ACs but disrupted ion transport into the interior of the ACs.
Nevertheless, reducing the ramp rate afforded a longer time for molecular
arrangement in the pitch samples, thus increasing the crystallinity
and electronic conductivity of the resulting ACs. By applying a multistep
pretreatment process, we obviated the necessity of a trade-off between
the electronic conductivity and ionic mobility of ACs caused by varying
the ramp rate. This multistep pretreatment process incorporated aliphatic
species into the aromatic mainframe of the pitch samples, forming
a pitch framework consisting of mesophase domains intersected by aliphatic
borders. We subjected a pitch sample to this multistep pretreatment
process, yielding a carbon electrode (i.e., AC-m) that exhibited high
crystallinity for electron conduction, high Smi for double-layer charge storage, and a hierarchical pore
structure for ion transport. The AC-m electrode was used to assemble
a symmetric EDLC, which registered an unprecedented high energy of
40 Wh kg–1 (20 Wh L–1) within
a voltage range of 0–2.7 V and sustained an E value of 24 Wh kg–1 (12 Wh L–1) at a high P value of 50 kW kg–1 (25 kW L–1). In summary, we developed a unique
and advantageous strategy for pretreating petroleum pitch to produce
high-performance EDLC electrodes. The defining characteristic of this
pretreatment strategy is its incorporation of aliphatic species into
the framework of mesophase pitch, which can increase the carbon yield
of petroleum pitch and produce carbons with properties advantageous
for EDLCs. The proposed pretreatment strategy may provide the foundation
for extensive applications of petroleum pitch in energy storage devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
Petroleum pitch
powder provided by Chinese Petroleum Co., Taiwan, served as the precursor
for producing porous carbons that could be used in EDLCs; the pitch
had 3–6% primary quinoline insolubles and a softening point
of 185 °C. Prior to KOH activation, we thermally pretreated the
as-received pitch at 430 °C to cross-link the constituent molecules.
Before the pretreatment procedure was performed, the pitch powder
was ground and sieved to an average grain size of approximately 0.3
mm. In the pretreatment procedure, the as-received pitch powder was
placed in a horizontal cylindrical furnace under N2 flow,
heated from room temperature to 430 °C, maintained at 430 °C
for 1 or 2 h, and finally cooled to room temperature. To heat the
powder from room temperature to 430 °C, we used a single-step
ramp at a heating rate of 1.5, 2, or 5 °C min–1 or a multistep ramp that involved linearly increasing the temperature
at 2 °C min–1 to 100 and 200 °C and then
holding each of these temperatures for 0.5 h.

The pitch samples
were impregnated with KOH at a KOH/pitch ratio of 4/1 and then thermally
treated to produce ACs. Our preliminary studies suggested that the
KOH/pitch ratio (4/1) resulted in optimal carbon yield and porosity
from activation. Specifically, the impregnated samples were thermally
treated at 800 °C for 1 h under N2 flow and then cooled
to room temperature. The products were washed using 1 L of 0.5 M HCl
solution at 85 °C for 30 min and then leached using 1 L of distilled
water at 85 °C several times until the pH value of the water–carbon
mixture was higher than 6. The leached products were then dried in
a vacuum at 110 °C for 24 h to yield KOH-activated carbons. All
samples were heated in an Ar atmosphere at 700 °C to remove surface
oxides.64

4.2 Carbon
Characterization
The microstructures
of the carbon specimens were examined using a high-resolution TEM
instrument (JEOL 2100F, Japan). The crystal structure was analyzed
using an XRD system (Rigaku, Ultima IV, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation
excited at 40 kV and 40 mA. A TGA instrument (PerkinElmer, TGA7, USA)
was used in a N2 atmosphere to estimate the decomposition
behavior. In addition, a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Eclipse LV100POL,
Japan) was used to characterize the formation of the mesophase in
the pitch specimens. The pore structure of the carbons was determined
through gas adsorption measurements; the measurements were performed
using an automated adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020
HD88, USA) that was operated at 77 K in a N2 atmosphere
at relative pressures (P/P0) that ranged from 10–7 to 1.

4.3 EDLC Assembly
The EDLCs used for
examination in this study exhibited a symmetrical two-electrode capacitor
configuration. To prepare the carbon electrodes, 2 mg of carbon powder
was dispersed in ethanol and then coated on a carbon-coated Al foil
under stress without using a binder. Symmetrical cells consisted of
two opposing carbon electrodes (with an active area of 1 cm2 and a thickness of approximately 40 μm) that were separated
by an electrolyte-loaded cellulose filter paper. The EDLCs were assembled
under stress to ensure close contact at the carbon–carbon and
carbon–Al foil interfaces.

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
All
electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature (approximately
25 °C). Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements were performed under the two-electrode configuration
by using an electrochemical analyzer (Solartron Analytical, 1470E,
UK). An ac impedance spectrum analyzer (Zahner-Elektrik, IM6e, Germany)
was used to analyze the impedance characteristics of the EDLCs. The
measurements were conducted at 0 V by applying an ac potential amplitude
of 5 mV and a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 100 kHz.
