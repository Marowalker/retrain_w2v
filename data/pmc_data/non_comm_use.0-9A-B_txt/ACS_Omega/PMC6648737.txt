We report that a porous, electron-rich,
covalent, organonitridic
framework (PECONF-4) exhibits an unusually high hydrogen uptake at
77 K, relative to its specific surface area. Chahine’s rule,
a widely cited heuristic for hydrogen adsorption, sets a maximum adsorptive
uptake of 1 wt % hydrogen at 77 K per 500 m2 of the adsorbent
surface area. High-pressure hydrogen adsorption measurements in a
Sieverts apparatus showed that PECONF-4 exceeds Chahine’s rule
by 50%. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface
area of PECONF-4 was measured redundantly with nitrogen, argon, and
carbon dioxide and found to be between 569 ± 2 and 676 ±
13 m2 g–1. Furthermore, hydrogen on PECONF-4
has a high heat of adsorption, in excess of 9 kJ mol–1.

Introduction
Hydrogen is an attractive
alternative fuel that is not subject
to the negative externalities of fossil fuels.1−4 Efficient hydrogen generation
and storage would benefit mobile and stationary energy needs.5,6 However, both mobile and stationary applications of hydrogen energy
require improvements in the volumetric energy density of stored hydrogen.7,8

Hydrogen storage by physisorption on high surface area adsorbents
has attracted attention because of fast cycle times, low regeneration
energies, and moderate operational pressures (compared to other hydrogen
storage techniques such as absorption, chemisorption, liquefaction,
and extreme pressurization). A number of carbonaceous and noncarbonaceous
high surface area adsorbents have been studied for their hydrogen
adsorption properties, with varied results.9−11 Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), in general, have been shown to adsorb 6–10
wt % of hydrogen,12 though scalability
issues and high materials costs limit potential use cases. Both MOFs
and covalent organic frameworks have recently attracted attention
for a variety of energy applications.13−16

The capacity of an adsorbent
is largely dependent on the porosity
accessible to the gas (quantified by specific surface area or micropore
volume) and the strength of the attractive physical interactions between
the adsorbate and the adsorbent (quantified by the isosteric heat
of adsorption). The optimal isosteric heat of adsorption to maximize
hydrogen delivery (at standard operating conditions) is between 15
and 20 kJ mol–1.17,18 Carbonaceous
adsorbents have high specific surface areas but isosteric heats generally
less than 9 kJ mol–1.18−21 Notable exceptions are oxygen-rich
microporous carbons developed by Blankenship et al.22 and the carbide derived carbons of Yushin et al.23 Alternative strategies to increase the isosteric
heat of hydrogen adsorption have included implanting metal ions or
nanoparticles and/or otherwise functionalizing the carbonaceous surface.24−26

In this work, we investigated the hydrogen physisorption properties
of PECONF-4, which is an inexpensive condensation product of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene
and 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Supporting Information, Section 1). PECONF-4 is an electron-rich compound,
making it a possible candidate for improved physisorption through
increased dispersion forces. In a prior study, we have shown that
PECONFs have high methane and carbon dioxide uptake and exceptional
selectivity for these gases over nitrogen.27 PECONF-4 has a polygranular structure with grain sizes on the order
of tens of nanometers, micropore diameters predominantly less than
7 Å in width, and no apparent macroporosity.

Results and Discussion
Specific
Surface Area
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method is the most commonly used technique for empirically assessing
the specific surface area of porous materials.28 The BET theory derives from a multilayer extension of the
Langmuir isotherm and the method gives a robust metric of specific
surface area. Nonetheless, limitations occur when using the BET method
to analyze microporous materials, typically resulting in an overestimation
of the specific surface area.29,30 These limitations and
the applicability of the BET method to microporous materials are discussed
in the Supporting Information, Section
10. Accordingly, when using the BET method to analyze PECONF-4, we
have followed the consistency criteria set forth by Rouquerol et al.28

Furthermore, the BET specific surface
area is dependent on the selected probe molecule. Different pores
are accessible to differently sized probe molecules. In this work,
we measured the BET specific surface area of PECONF-4 using three
different probe molecules, nitrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide at
77, 87, and 298 K. Each probe molecule offers a different advantage.
Diatomic nitrogen is the original BET probe molecule, has a cross-sectional
area of 16.2 Å squared, and has been through the most historical
vetting with the BET method.28 However,
nitrogen has a quadrupole moment that may interact with surface electric
field gradients, leading to alignment or other error inducing effects.
Argon is slightly smaller, with a cross-sectional area of 13.8 Å
squared, and as it is spherically symmetric, it only has nonspecific
charge interactions.28 Carbon dioxide has
a cross-sectional area of 21.0 Å squared and a strong quadrupole
moment, but a higher critical temperature.28 In very small pores (as found in PECONF-4, Supporting Information, Section 4), errors may be induced by kinetically
limited equilibration times at cryogenic temperatures. Carbon dioxide
BET measurements at room temperature are less susceptible to kinetic
limitations than cryogenic measurements with nitrogen or argon.31

At least two BET isotherms were measured
for each gas (nitrogen,
argon, and carbon dioxide) on PECONF-4, and specific surface areas
were calculated (Table 1) by two methods, as described in the Supporting Information, Section 11. The average BET specific surface areas
of PECONF-4 as measured by nitrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide were
673 ± 18, 676 ± 13, and 569 ± 2 m2 g–1, respectively. The average point B specific surface
areas determined using nitrogen and carbon dioxide were 534 ±
9 and 673 ± 4 m2 g–1, respectively.
The argon isotherms were too sparse in the region of interest to apply
the point B method.

Areas as Calculated

point B (m2 g–1)	534 ± 9	N/A	673 ± 4	
Chahine’s rule is based on the BET surface area and posits
that the maximum excess hydrogen adsorption on a material at 77 K
is 1 wt % for every 500 m2 of the BET surface area.1,2 This rule follows from estimates of hydrogen packing on graphene
and has been demonstrated empirically in numerous hydrogen adsorption
studies with few exceptions.1,2,32−34 While initially posited only for carbonaceous adsorbents,
studies have shown Chahine’s rule to be more generally applicable
to porous materials including MOFs.35−37 Several candidate materials
have been hypothesized to exceed Chahine’s rule by incorporating
metal ions into a high surface area carbon or by other functionalization
of the surface to alter hydrogen packing and densify the adsorbed
phase, though most of these ideas are untested.24−26

Hydrogen Adsorption
Measurements
We measured hydrogen
excess adsorption on PECONF-4 using Sievert’s method at temperatures
of 77, 87, 253, 273, and 298 K and at pressures up to 9 MPa. In calculating
excess adsorption, we used gas-phase densities from the NIST REFPROP
Standard Reference Database.38 The highest
measured excess adsorption was 10.3 mmol g–1 (2.03
wt %), at 77 K. This corresponds to 1.50 wt % hydrogen uptake for
every 500 m2 of adsorbent surface area, 50% above the maximum
posited by Chahine’s rule. This value is a conservative estimate
based on the highest surface area measured, 676 m2 g–1.

Isosteric Heat of Adsorption
To
assess the isosteric
heats of hydrogen adsorption on PECONF-4, we simultaneously fitted
excess adsorption isotherms at multiple temperatures using a superposition
of Langmuir isotherms (dual-Langmuir method, Supporting Information, Section 12) (Figure 1). The robustness of this fitting procedure
has been previously demonstrated with multiple gases,39−42 and here allows for a simultaneous fit of all our hydrogen adsorption
data with average residual squared errors of 0.0213 (mmol g–1)2 per point. This fitting technique was adapted from
work by Mertens43 and was modified for
the nonideal gas regime. In particular, this fitting procedure relies
on the physically relevant Langmuir equation, avoids ideal gas assumptions
and the common (though false) assumption that the adsorbed phase has
negligible volume, and recognizes that excess adsorption cannot be
used to approximate absolute adsorption at high pressures. This methodology
is detailed in the Supporting Information, Section 12, and gives the isosteric heats of adsorption as opposed
to the isoexcess heats of adsorption as is typically reported.

Figure 1 Dual-Langmuir
fit of hydrogen excess adsorption data on PECONF-4
at 77, 87, 253, 273, and 298 K.

The isosteric heats of hydrogen adsorption on PECONF-4 at
different
temperatures are plotted as functions of pressure in Figure 2. The low-pressure values are
in the range of 9.5–10.5 kJ mol–1 for cryogenic
temperatures (77–87 K), significantly higher than their moderate
temperature (253–298 K) counterparts. Temperature dependence
of the isosteric heats is expected from surface heterogeneity.44 As a redundant check, we also calculated the
low temperature isosteric heats of hydrogen adsorption on PECONF-4
using only data from the 77 and 87 K isotherms. This redundant check
yielded results similar to Figure 2 (see Supporting Information, Section 13).

Figure 2 Isosteric heats of hydrogen adsorption on PECONF-4 as
calculated
by the dual-Langmuir fitting procedure.

For comparison, the isoexcess heat of hydrogen adsorption
on PECONF-4
was also calculated from the isotherm data without relying on any
fitting procedure. This method, described in the Supporting Information, Section 14, relies on a number of
assumptions that make it less accurate than the dual-Langmuir method.
In particular, this isoexcess method assumes ideal gas conditions
and negligible adsorbed-phase volume and does not differentiate between
excess and absolute adsorption. Results from this method are plotted
in Figure 3. As expected,
the isoexcess heat of adsorption differs in detail from Figure 2 and has more scatter because
of noise. Nonetheless, the results of this isoexcess method suggest
that PECONF-4 has a high isosteric heat, likely in the range of 8.5–10
kJ mol–1, in approximate agreement with the results
of the dual-Langmuir method.

Figure 3 Isoexcess heat of hydrogen adsorption on PECONF-4,
determined without
fitting the adsorption data.

PECONF-4 has a high isosteric heat compared to other experimentally
measured microporous carbons.19,24,45,46 This result can in part be attributed
to the small pore sizes of PECONF-4 (Supporting Information, Section 4), in which overlapping wall potentials
increase the overall dispersion interactions. Schindler and LeVan
have calculated that slit-pore carbons with 4–6 Å pores
can have Henry’s law regime isosteric heats of 7–10
kJ mol–1.47 However,
in practice, very few carbonaceous materials have been reported to
have isosteric heats of hydrogen adsorption in excess of 9 kJ mol–1, even when pore sizes are comparable to PECONF-4.19−21,34 Notable exceptions have been
reported for microporous carbons with uniquely functionalized surfaces
such as oxygen-rich microporous carbons and carbide-derived carbons.22,23 It is possible that the electron-rich nature of PECONF-4 contributes
to its high isosteric heat and exceptional hydrogen uptake. PECONF-4
is electron-rich because of its electron-donating NH2 groups,
wherein the electron lone pair at the nitrogen can participate in
the backbone pi bonding. The dispersion forces for physisorption are
expected to increase with electron density in the adsorbent. Charge
transfer interactions with the adsorbed hydrogen may be possible,
but these usually give much higher enthalpies of adsorption. Although
important details need clarification, the electron-rich nature of
PECONF-4 is believed to contribute to its large isosteric heat of
hydrogen adsorption, much like for carbon dioxide.27

Conclusions
In conclusion, PECONF-4
has an exceptionally high hydrogen uptake
relative to its specific surface area. A conservative analysis shows
that at 77 K, PECONF-4 adsorbs 1.50 wt % of hydrogen per 500 m2 of surface area, which exceeds Chahine’s rule by 50%.
This also corresponds to a high isosteric heat of adsorption, in excess
of 9 kJ mol–1, possibly resulting from interactions
between adsorbed hydrogen and the electron-rich backbone of PECONF-4.
These properties make PECONF-4 an interesting new candidate for hydrogen
storage and separation. Further work to increase the specific surface
area while maintaining the unique surface chemistry of PECONF-4-like
materials could make them important as materials for hydrogen storage.
