Graphene is an attractive
material for photodetection and optoelectronic
applications because it offers a broad spectral bandwidth and ultrafast
response speed. However, because of the broad light absorption characteristic,
graphene has a lack of selectivity to the wavelength, which limits
the performance of graphene-based photodetectors. Here, we demonstrate
a novel hybrid photodetector with monolayer graphene covered with
an ultrathin film of surface covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with
variable structures as the light-harvesting materials. Photodetectors
based on surface COF–G show enhanced responsivity in comparison
with unmodified graphene and graphene modified with monomers. The
submolecular resolution of scanning tunneling microscopy allows us
to get a direct insight into the relationship between the microscopic
interfacial structure and the performance of the device. We prove
that the enhancement in the device performance is directly related
with the orderliness of surface COFs, which influences the interfacial
charge transfer by tuning π–π stacking between
surface COF and graphene.

Introduction
Graphene, a single
layer of the two-dimensional (2D) carbon crystalline
structure, is currently the center of attention because of its extraordinary
electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.1−9 Graphene can absorb photons from the visible to the infrared range
because of its zero band gap characteristic, and this makes it a promising
material for broadband photodetectors, and its extraordinary high
carrier mobility facilitates achievement of ultrafast photoresponse,10,11 but at the same time makes it lack selectivity to the wavelength12 and leads to the poor performance of the device
in terms of photoresponsivity.8,13 The low photoresponsivity
is mainly attributed to the limited light absorption in the one-atom
layer and the short recombination lifetime of the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs. To overcome this shortcoming, one should increase either the
efficient absorption14−16 or the lifetime of the photoexcited carriers by modifying
graphene without degradation of its carrier mobility. Being a 2D material,
the conductance of graphene is very sensitive to electrostatic perturbation
by photogenerated carriers close to the surface,17 thus graphene photodetectors can be sensitized by variable
means such as optical microcavity,18,19 colloidal
quantum dots (QDs) such as PbS,20,21 CdS,22 ZnO23 and SnO2,24 or InSe,25 and organic
dyes.26

As an intrinsic organic semiconductor,
covalent organic frameworks
(COFs) with the π-conjugated structure can be used as the light-harvesting
materials in optoelectronic devices.27−33 The band gap and photoelectric properties of COFs can be precisely
tuned by the topology and periodicity of the precursor. In contrast
to the bulk COFs which are insoluble and difficult to process, surface
COFs can grow in situ on arbitrary surfaces and exhibit high compatibility
with traditional microfabrication techniques.34,35 Benefiting from the planar geometry, it possesses great advantages
for flexible devices.36 However, the relatively
low carrier mobility in COFs hinders the development of high-performance
field-effect transistors and photodetectors.32,33 Combining the high charge carrier mobility of graphene with the
light-harvesting properties of surface COFs might create fascinating
hybrid materials which enable fabrication of high-performance photodetectors
with both high responsivity and speed. More importantly, the hydrophobic
graphene surface can promote the preferred crystalline orientation
of the surface COFs through epitaxial effects, thus facilitating the
possible charge transfer between surface COFs and graphene.37−39

The intrinsic semiconducting property of surface COFs40,41 can enable harvesting of light and forming a built-in electric field
because of Fermi level equilibration to facilitate charge carrier
separation in the surface COF–graphene hybrid, which may lead
to a gain mechanism in graphene-based photoconductors and thus result
in high-performance photodetectors. In the present work, we use on-surface
Schiff-base coupling42,43 to synthesize diverse ultrathin
surface COF films on single-layer graphene and demonstrate a photodetector
based on surface COF–graphene heterostructures. The interface
structure of the hybrids can be fine-tuned by adjusting the concentration
of reaction precursors and characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) with submolecular details, which represents a major advantage
in comparison with those photodetectors based on small organic molecules
and QD-graphene hybrids with a hardly known actual interface structure.
Remarkably, the π–π interaction and van der Waals
epitaxy effect between the surface COFs and graphene allow precise
control of the relative alignment between these materials and favors
charge transport between surface COFs and graphene. Submolecularly
resolved STM studies on the interface structure provide direct evidence
on the relationship between the microscopic interfacial structure
and the photoresponse behaviors of these surface COF–graphene
hybrid devices. This work demonstrates that the orderliness of the
surface COFs plays an important role in determining the device performance.

Results
and Discussion
The structure of building blocks and schematic
illustration of
surface COF synthesis are shown in Scheme 1. If 1 fully reacts with diamine 2, 3, and 4, it can form extended
honeycomb networks with hexagonal pores on the graphene surface (Scheme 1b).

(4) (b) Schematic Illustration of the Co-Condensation
of Aldehyde and Amine Monomers Into Surface COFs
As shown in Figure 1 and also demonstrated in our previous report, the on-surface
synthesis
of imine COFs at the interface is very sensitive to the concentration
of monomers. For the three diamines shown in Scheme 1, keeping the molar ratio of aldehyde to
amine monomers as 2:3, by tuning the concentration of the precursors’
well-ordered surface, COFs can be obtained at the liquid–solid
interface at room temperature with almost entire surface coverage
when the monomer concentration before mix is 0.003 mg g–1 (Figure 1a–c).
However, with the increasing concentration of the monomers (the monomer
concentration before mix is 1 mg g–1), the interfacial
structure varies for the three surface COFs.

Figure 1 Representative STM images
of surface COFs formed at octanoic acid/graphene
on the copper foil (L/S) interface. (a,d) Surface COF1+2, (b,e) surface COF1+3, and (c,f) surface COF1+4. The molar ratio of aldehyde to amine is 2:3, and the monomer
concentration before mix is (a–c) 0.003 and (d–f) 0.1
mg g–1. Imaging conditions: (a) Iset = 98 pA, Vbias = 0.10;
(b) Iset = 240 pA, Vbias = 0.15 V; (c) Iset = 30 pA, Vbias = 0.20 V; (d) Iset = 50 pA, Vbias = 0.50 V; (e) Iset = 90 pA, Vbias = 0.20 V; (f) Iset = 120 pA, Vbias = 0.40 V.

For surface COF1+2, well-organized
honeycomb structures were observed (Figure 1d); while for surface COF1+3, although it mainly contains regular honeycomb
networks, the pores of the network are filled with oligomers (Figure 1e). For surface COF1+4, a high monomer concentration
leads to densely packed disordered oligomers which cover the whole
surface (Figure 1f).
The different assembling behaviors of these systems are attributed
to both the affinity of the diamine monomers toward the surface and
the increased flexibility with the elongation of the backbone.

To fabricate surface COF–graphene (surface COF–G)
photodetectors, single-layer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) was first transferred onto a SiO2/Si wafer using
the classical poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-mediated method (Figure
S1, Supporting Information).3 Surface COF networks were synthesized on the
surface of graphene through on-surface Schiff-base coupling at either
the liquid–solid (L/S) or gas–solid (G/S) interface
after Ti/Au (2.5/40 nm) electrode deposition. After synthesis, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to verify the formation
of imine bonds (Figure S2, Supporting Information). UV–vis spectrum revealed absorption peaks at 390, 385,
and 470 nm for surfaces COF1+2, COF1+3, and COF1+4, respectively
(Figure S3, Supporting Information). Thus,
we used a 400 nm laser to investigate the photoresponse of the surface
COF–G hybrid photodetectors.

Figure 2a shows
a simplified schematic depiction of the surface COF–G photodetector.
As show in Figure 2b, the Dirac point (i.e., the charge neutrality point) of graphene
shifts to more positive values after functionalization with surface
COF1+2, indicating that the surface COF1+2 acts as a p-type dopant which is consistent
with the current–time (I–t) response characteristics (Figure 3). The decrease in the device mobility with respect
to the pristine device in the −50 to +40 V (Vg) region might be due to charge scattering caused by
the interface structure after COF modification.44 Because one advantage of surface COFs is that the structural
regularity can be easily tuned, here, we focus on discussion of the
structure dependence of photoresponsive behaviors of these surface
COF–G photodetectors.

of the surface COF–G
photodetector. (b) Characteristic I–Vg curves of pristine graphene (black) and surface

Figure 3 (a,b) Typical photocurrent response of detectors of surface
COF1+2–G and (c,d) surface COF1+4–G hybrids at the octanoic acid/graphene
(L/S) interface.
The molar ratio of aldehyde to amine is 2:3, and the monomer concentration
before mix is (a,c) 0.1 and (b,d) 0.003 mg g–1.

Figure 3 shows the
typical photocurrent response of surface COF–G photodetectors
of surfaces COF1+2 and COF1+4 at different monomer concentrations.
In these devices, the surface COFs are synthesized in situ at the
liquid–solid interface, which allows fine-tuning of the structure
regularity. A pronounced current change was observed under irradiation
(bias voltage Vds = 0.1 V, VG = 0 V). In contrast, the photoresponse of pure graphene
or graphene modified with monomers is negligible under the same irradiation
(Figures S4 and S5, Supporting Information), indicating that the enhancement of light responsivity comes from
the surface COFs rather than the monomers. For surface COF1+2–G photodetector, we observed a much significant
increase in the photocurrent with a high monomer concentration (Figure 3a) compared to that
with a lower monomer concentration (Figure 3b). However, this was inversed in the case
of the surface COF1+4–G photodetector
(Figure 3c,d): the
photodetector with a lower monomer concentration shows a more pronounced
current increase. These results can be rationalized with the different
structural evolution with change in the monomer concentration for
these two surface COFs.43 As shown above,
surface COF1+2 forms highly ordered structures
at both high and low monomer concentrations, and because it forms
A–A stacking multilayers at a high monomer concentration42,43 (Figure S6), the increased film thickness
leads to stronger light absorption and the π–π
stacking facilitates charge transfer between surface COF1+2 and graphene, which in turn leads to
an increased photoresponse. However, for surface COF1+4, with a high monomer concentration, only disordered oligomers
form at the interface. Because of the low conjugation degree and possibly
bad adsorption registration, these oligomers do not contribute so
much to enhance the photoresponse of the device. Only with a low monomer
concentration, well-defined surface COF1+4 forms at the interface and the photoresponse of the device is significantly
enhanced. These results strongly suggest that the enhanced photoresponse
is directly related to the formation of well-ordered surface COFs.

To put more in-depth insights into the relationship between the
interfacial structure of surface COFs and the performance of the surface
COF–G photodetector, we have investigated the photoresponse
properties with the photodetectors prepared both at the liquid–solid
interface at room temperature and with moderate heating under low
vacuum. As shown in Figure 4 and discussed above, the photoresponse properties of the
photodetectors with surface COF1+2/G and surface
COF1+4/G show very different trends with the
change of the monomer concentration, which we attribute to different
trends in the change of interfacial structures in response to the
monomer concentration. Interestingly, although surface COF1+3 shows compact assembly of not fully reacted oligomers
at the liquid–solid interface when the concentration of monomers
is high, the photoresponse is still significantly enhanced (Figures 4b and S7). This is rationalized by the unique interfacial
structure of this surface COF with a high monomer concentration. As
shown in Figures 1e, S6, and S8, at a high
monomer concentration, surface COF1+3 forms
compact assembly composed of pitches of hexagons and zig-zag oligomers
in the layer in direct contact with the graphite surface, while a
well-ordered surface COF1+3 with regular hexagon
structure is discovered on the top of this layer (Figure S8). This allows π–π stacking both
between the first layer and the substrate and the top layer and the
first layer, facilitating efficient charge transfer between graphene
and surface COF1+3. Moreover, this may be
the reason for the enhanced photoresponse of the surface COF1+3/G composites.

Figure 4 Statistical analysis of responsivity of
devices of surface COF–G
hybrids prepared at the L/S and G/S (after heating) interface, and
the monomer concentration before mix is (a) 0.003 and (b) 0.1 mg g–1; the inset in (a) shows a magnified image.

When the surface COF/G composites were prepared
under low vacuum
with moderate heating, the unreacted monomers, especially the monomers
with a low molecular weight, will be pumped out of the chamber and
the increased temperature favors the reaction to proceed more completely.42 Thus, under such conditions the surface COFs
prepared at either low or high monomer concentrations can form regular
networks (Figure S9, Supporting Information), and the influence of the monomer concentration on the performance
of surface COF–G hybrids is not as significant as that at the
liquid–solid interface (Figures 4 and 5a). However, atomic force
microscopy (AFM) characterization still reveals a dependence of the
film thickness on the monomer concentration (Figure 5a), although the dependence varies with the
combination of monomers. Only the response of surface COF1+2 and COF1+4 increases with
increasing film thickness. This may be attributed to the inefficient
charge transfer in the thicker films.

Figure 5 (a) Relationship between the film thickness
and the responsivity
of the devices. Surface COF1+2, COF1+3, and COF1+4 were represented
by circles, triangles, and squares, respectively. Blue and red colors
represent the different concentrations of 0.1 and 0.003 mg g–1, respectively. Statistical analysis of the response time of different
COFx+y–G
devices with different concentrations before and after heating, and
the concentration of the monomers before mixing is (b) 0.003 and (c)
0.1 mg g–1.

For all the three surface COFs, the response speed decreases with
the increasingfilm thickness (Figure 5b,c), which might be caused by the longer migration
distance of the charges in the thicker films. The modification of
optical properties of graphene might arise from the charge transfer
between surface COFs and graphene. When the surface COFs absorb light,
the photogenerated holes can be injected into the valence band of
graphene, while photogenerated electrons remain in the conduction
bands of surface COFs. Thus, the photocurrent will be enhanced both
because of the increase of number of carriers in graphene and the
recombination lifetime. The enlarged domains of more ordered surface
COFs allow the excitons to be delocalized45 and more easily diffuse to the interface.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have directly synthesized surface COF films with
variable structures on graphene and investigated the photodetecting
performance of these hybrid materials. The photodetectors based on
surface COF–G heterostructures show enhanced responsivity in
comparison with unmodified graphene and graphene modified with monomers.
In addition, the well-controlled synthesis of surface COFs at the
liquid–solid interface allows us to get a direct insight into
the relationship between the microscopic interfacial structure and
the performance of the hybrids with the aid of submolecular resolution
of scanning tunneling microscopy. We proved that the enhancement is
directly related with the formation of the well-ordered surface COF
interfacial structure. The intrinsic semiconducting property of surface
COFs both enables harvesting of light with selected wavelengths and
facilitates charge carrier separation in the surface COFs–graphene
hybrids. Our work not only opens a viable way for the potential applications
of surface COFs but also provides a possible strategy for understanding
the microscopic interfacial structure–performance relationship
of sensitized photodetectors of other 2D materials.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All the starting materials, except monomer
4, were purchased either from J&K or Aldrich and used without
further purification. The monomer 4 was synthesized according
to the reported methods.46 All the solvents
are of ACS grade unless otherwise noted.

Device Fabrication
The silicon wafer with a 300 nm
oxidization layer was used for device fabrication. The channel length
between the source and drain electrodes was around 130 μm in
length and 3 mm in width. The symmetric source and drain electrodes
[Ti (2.5 nm)/Au (40 nm)] were deposited on the graphene film through
a shadow mask by thermal evaporation, followed by annealing in an
Ar atmosphere to remove additional impurities adsorbed on graphene.
The monomer solution was deposited on the graphene between source
and drain electrodes with a simple drop-casting method.

Synthesis of
COFs on the Graphene Device
The large-area
single-layer graphene was grown on Cu foil by the CVD method and then
was transferred onto a SiO2/Si wafer using the classical
PMMA-mediated method.3 The graphene was
transferred onto the SiO2/Si substrate for further evaluation
and applications (Figure S1a,b). The uniformity
of the graphene film can be evaluated via color contrast under an
optical microscope. The brighter region (white arrow) refers to the
SiO2/Si substrate, and the darker color (black arrow) corresponds
to the bilayer or multilayer graphene. The quality of graphene on
a SiO2/Si substrate was further verified by Raman spectroscopy
(Figure S1c). The two prominent peaks are
G and 2D peaks, and the intensity ratio of 2D/G approximately shows
typical features of the monolayer graphene.47

For the on-surface synthesis of COFx+y at the liquid/solid interface at
room temperature, the monomers (1, 2) were
dissolved in the octanoic acid solvent with a mass concentration of
0.1 and 0.003 mg g–1, respectively. Then, 1 and 2 were mixed with a mole ratio of about
(1/2 = 2:3). The monomers (3, 4) were first dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
with a mass concentration of 1 mg g–1 and diluted
with octanoic acid to 0.1 and 0.003 mg g–1, respectively,
then mixed with a mole ratio of about (1:3/4 = 2:3). After that, the mix solution was drop-casted on the graphene/SiO2/Si surface with the evaporated Ti/Au electrode. The amount
of the drop-cast just covered the surface of graphene. Synthesis of
COFx+y at
the gas/solid interface: the abovementioned samples were positioned
in a preheated vacuum oven and annealed at 140 °C for 30 min
with a base pressure of <133 Pa.

Characterization
All the measurements were carried
out at room temperature and ambient conditions. The graphene photodetector
was characterized with a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley
2400 SourceMeter) and the I–V characteristics of the graphene photodetector were measured with
a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS) in a dark box
to eliminate the interference of ambient light.

Monochromatic
light measurements were recorded using a CT 150 xenon arc lamp source
monochromated by using a DK 240 monochromator. The light power intensity
was measured by using an AvaSpec-ULS2048 optical power meter (Physcience
Opto-Electronics., Ltd., Beijing) in the same experimental conditions.
The laser spot is a square with the size 3 mm × 3 mm, while the
light on-off experiments were carried out by repeated on–off
switching.

STM measurements were performed by using an Agilent
5100 scanning
probe microscope with mechanically formed Pt/Ir (80/20) tips under
ambient conditions. All the images were taken with the constant current
mode.

The AFM characterization of the COFx+y–G hybrid was performed
with
a Bruker MultiMode-8, operated at room temperature and ambient conditions.

XPS was performed with an ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer with
a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (1486.7 eV).

The
optical image was acquired with an intelligent semiautomatic
digital microscope DM4000M. The Raman spectra were excited at 532
nm with an incident power <1 mW (laser spot diameter was 500 nm)
with a Renishaw inVia plus.

The XPS and UV–vis spectroscopy
experiments were prepared
by the same synthetic methods as mentioned above on the graphene surface.
The concentration of the monomers was 0.1 mg g–1 of all the samples for XPS and UV–vis spectroscopy experiments.
