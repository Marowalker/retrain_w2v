==== Body
The following corrections are
needed for the title article.

Graphical abstract: The configurations
required for d-glucosamine
in the N-glycoside were incorrect in the original
manuscript. The corrected configuration for the graphical abstract
is

Compound 4b in Scheme 2 based on the configuration
of galactose should be

Configuration of the glucosamine
pyranose ring in compounds in
Scheme 4 should be

Configuration of the final compound
in the mechanism depicted in
Scheme 6 should be
