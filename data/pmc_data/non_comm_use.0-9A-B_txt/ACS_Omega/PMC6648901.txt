Graphene (GE) has attracted significant
attention on account of
its unique structure and superior performance, arousing a new research
field for materials science. Herein, a novel GE-coated poly(ethylene
terephthalate) nonwoven (PGNW) hollow tube (PGNW-T) was fabricated
for continuous and highly effective oil collection from the water
surface. The PGNW was prepared via a dip-spray coating method, which
possessed superhydrophobicity–superoleophilicity and could
absorb a variety of oils or organic solvents with the absorption capacity
(Q) value of 18–34 times its own weight. Then,
PGNW-T was obtained through winding the PGNW on the surface of a porous
polypropylene hollow tube. As-prepared PGNW-T was competent for dynamic
oil collection with high flux (18 799.94 L/m2 h),
outstanding separation efficiency (97.14%), and excellent recyclability
(>96% after 10 cycles) from the oil/water mixture. In particular,
a miniature device based on as-prepared PGNW-T was developed for continuous
thin oil film collection, which could dynamically “catch up”
floated oils or organic solvents from the water surface. Finally,
our strategy is extremely facile to scale up, showing its huge potential
application in practical oil-spill remediation.

1 Introduction
Over
the past few decades, along with the rapid development of
industry, oil spill and chemical leakage accidents have a catastrophic
impact on the aquatic system and pose a severe threat to human lives.1,2 Consequently, the development of oil-spill removal technology has
attracted tremendous attention from both research community and general
public. There are many traditional methods, such as skimmers,3 in situ burning,4 solidifiers,5 bioremediation,6 dispersants,7 and using absorbents,8 to deal with large amounts of oil spill. Among these technologies,
porous absorbents have been frequently used for oil-spill remediation
owing to their low cost and eco-friendly treating process. Unfortunately,
these kinds of absorbents, including bentonite, zeolite, corn stalk,
and activated carbon,9−11 still have limitations for practical oil-spill cleanup
including low selectivity (absorb both oil and water), inferior absorption
capacity, and poor recyclability.

To overcome the drawbacks
of traditional absorbents, numerous efforts
have been carried out to develop new suoperhydrophobic–superoleophilic
porous absorbents, including metal oxides,12 porous boron nitride,13 carbon based
sponge,14 and swellable oleophilic polymer
absorbents.15 In general, they possessed
excellent oil absorption capacity (Q) and could selectively
absorb oil while repelling water, thus showing good performance for
oil collection. However, they could not absorb oil anymore when the
absorbents reached the Q value and have to stop and
desorb inner oils by squeezing or distillation for reuse. Consequently,
this noncontinuous process is still a relatively ineffective method
along with the time-consuming and cost-expensive process. More recently,
filtration materials with superhydrophobic–superoleophilic
properties, such as metallic mesh16,17and polymeric
membranes,18,19 have aroused considerable attention
for oil/water separation owing to their continuous separation ability
and outstanding separation efficiency, but they often suffered low
flux, high energy consuming, and easy surface fouling due to their
small pore size (<0.3 μm).20 Furthermore,
the oil/water mixture must be collected before filtration. In fact,
the spilled oil usually spread rapidly on the water surface and need
to collect immediately to alleviate further detriment. Hence, these
filtration materials have much limitation to deal with large-area
oil spills.

Graphene (GE), a two-dimensional structure consisting
of sp2-hybridized carbon, has aroused a lot of attention
owing to
its unique properties, such as unique electronic/thermal conductivity,
ultrahigh surface area, and highlighted hydrophobic–superoleophilic
property.21−23 Recently, owing to its outstanding hydrophobicity–superoleophilicity,
a variety of GE-based (GB) materials have been developed for oil removal,
including spongy GE,24 GE-polymer composite
three-dimensional (3D) porous materials,25 and GE-carbon nanotube foams.26 For instance,
Zhang et al.27 fabricated superhydrophobic–superoleophilic
GE-coated polyurethane (GN@PU) sponge through a dip-coating method.
The resultant GN@PU could selectively absorb various oils with the Q value being up to 31 times its weight. Ge et al.28 prepared GE-coated cotton using the self-assembly
approach, where GE oxide was coated on cotton, followed by in situ
reduction by hydrazine hydrate. The GE-coated cotton exhibited high
oil/water selectivity with a Q value of 30 g/g. The
in situ reduction method to prepare hydrophobic–oleophilic
GB materials was also researched by Liu et al.,29 Shi et al.,30 and Wang et al.,31 respectively. Generally, these GB materials
possessed of outstanding absorption and separation properties, but
until now, excess attention has been paid to the Q value, but ignore their cost-expensive and time-consuming recovery
process by mechanical squeezing, burning, or distillation. The high
cost, complicated fabrication process, and poor interfacial bonding
together with the noncontinuous oil collection process of GB materials
block their further application in practical oil spill collection.

To deal with the limitations mentioned above, a novel GE-coated
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) nonwoven hollow tube was prepared
for continuous and highly effective oil collection in this study.
The poly(ethylene terephthalate) nonwoven (PGNW) with superhydrophobicity–superoleophilicity
was prepared through a dip-spray coating method, which can absorb
a variety of oils and organic solvents. PGNW hollow tube (PGNW-T)
was formed through winding the PGNW on the surface of the inner support
of the porous polypropylene (PP) hollow tube, which was competent
to dynamic oils collected from the oil/water mixture along with high
flux, outstanding separation efficiency, and excellent recyclability,
even under corrosive conditions. More importantly, a miniature device
based on PGNW-T was innovatively designed for continuous thin oil
film collection, which shows excellent collection ability for various
floated oils or organic solvents. Our strategy shows its huge potential
application for industrial scaleup in oil-spill remediation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
PGNW
GE-coated
nonwovens with a superhydrophobic–superoleophilic surface become
a key factor to make sure that the as-prepared sample could fulfill
oil sorption while repelling water, a rational loading amount of GE
on nonwovens should be defined at first. Hence, the relationship between
GE loading (measured by WGE/Wnonwoven × 100%, where WGE is the weight of GE on the as-prepared sample and Wnonwoven is the weight of original nonwoven) and hydrophobicity
of the sample was investigated. As shown in Figure 1, when the sample was treated by a successive
three times dipping and drying process, the superhydrophobic surface
could be acquired with the water contact angle (WCA) being up to 153.2°.
The mechanism of the relationship between GE loading and hydrophobicity
of the sample could be explained as follows: a superhydrophobic solid
surface could be obtained by introducing hydrophobic composition and
combining with a proper roughed structure.32 Commercial PET nonwovens are macroscopically roughed surface materials
with 3D network pore structure but their surface could be easily wetted
by water (Figure S1). So the coating of
the GE sheet on PET fibers was expected to build a micro–nano
roughed structure, thus altering the surface wettability of the nonwoven
due to the intrinsically hydrophobic property of the GE sheet. Therefore,
insufficient GE loading could not afford the requirement of a superhydrophobic
surface, and the 4.73 wt % GE loading was enough to form a superhydrophobic
surface. In addition, more GE loading may cause some problems such
as being easily peeled off or block the pores of the sample. Thus,
the sample which suffered the three times dipping and drying process
(GNW) with 4.73 wt % GE loading was chosen for further study and application.

Figure 1 Variation
of the WCA and graphene loading of the as-prepared sample
with different dipping times.

The morphologies of pristine PET nonwoven, GNW, and PGNW
are shown
in Figure 2. The 3D
fibrous network structure could be clearly observed for all three
samples, which confirmed that the coating of GE sheets and poly(vinylidene
difluoride) (PVDF) had little influence on the structure of PET nonwovens.
However, in the high-magnification images, the uncoated PET nonwoven
composed of microfibers exhibited a smooth surface, and after the
dipping and drying process, a random-oriented GE sheet was uniformly
coated on the PET microfibers for forming a dense layer. The surface
roughness of the fibers dramatically increased, and the micro–nano
scale roughness of the fibers combined with the macroscopically roughed
surface of the PET nonwoven formed a hierarchical structure. This
hierarchical roughed structure was adequate to acquire a superhydrophobic
surface due to the hydrophobicity of the GE sheet. To immobilize the
GE sheet on the PET fiber, a diluted PVDF solution was further sprayed
onto the GNW, and the microstructure of the fibers are shown in Figure 2c1,c2. A thin PVDF
film was covered on the surface of fibers and could be legibly recognized.
However, this thin film did not cover the GE sheet entirely, and some
random-oriented GE sheets were partly exposed on the surface of fibers,
thus maintaining the roughness of the fibers while ensuring the interfacial
bonding between the GE sheet and PET fibers.

Figure 2 Field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) images of PET
nonwoven (a1, a2), GNW (b1, b2), and PGNW (c1, c2) at different magnifications.

The hydrophobicity of PGNW was
determined by WCA measurement, and
the processes were recorded by a high-speed camera. As shown in Figure 3a, when a 2 μL
water droplet was dropped onto the surface of PGNW, the droplet held
an almost spheroidal shape and WCA could reach 154.4°, showing
a superhydrophobic surface while further indicating that the PVDF
film did not cover the GE sheet entirely and a hierarchical roughed
structure was formed after PVDF coating. The hierarchical rough structure
of PGNW dramatically reduced the water–solid contact area,
and an “air cushion” was formed between the surface
of PGNW and the water droplet, which suggests the formation of a nonwetting
Cassie–Baxter surface on the surface of PGNW.33 Besides, the water sliding angle (WSA) is another important
wetting property for selective absorption, as shown in Figure S2, and the WSA of PGNW was about 8.3°
(measured by dropping a water droplet on the surface of PGNW, then
gradually tilting the PGNW until the water droplet began to roll,
finally calculating WSA by acrtan (H/L)),34 further confirming the superhydrophobic surface of PGNW. Meanwhile,
when a kerosene droplet contacts the surface of PGNW, it immediately
permeated into the fibrous network of PGNW within 250 ms due to the
oleophilicity of the GE sheet on PET fibers, thus showing the superoleophilicity
of PGNW with the exceedingly low oil contact angle (OCA) of 0°.
The surface wettability of pristine nonwoven and PGNW could be seen
visually in Figure S1.

Figure 3 Dynamic process of the
WCA (a1–a3) and OCA (b1–b3)
of PGNW.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was employed to analyze
the surface modification of nonwovens. As shown in Figure 4, the signals of carbon (C
1s) and oxygen (O 1s) at about 285 and 532 eV were observed for pristine
PET nonwoven, which was similar to a previous report.35 The main elements of GNW were nearly unchanged after dipping
in GE suspension, but the intensity of the C signal obviously increased
and the content of carbon increased from 74.18 to 87.24 atom %, which
could be attributed to the GE coating on the surface of PET fibers.
High concentration of carbon resulted in low surface energy, which
was beneficial for enhancing the surface hydrophobicity.28 For PGNW, a new F 1s peak emerged, which could
be attributed to −CF2 from PVDF coating. These results
further confirm the GE sheet and PVDF coating layer on the surface
of PET fibers.

Figure 4 XPS spectra of PET nonwoven, GNW, and PGNW.

Q value is a key index for an
absorbent for oil
collection; also, the Q value of PGNW (including
engine oil, pump oil, soybean oil, palm oil, butyl acrylate, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), diesel, kerosene,
and toluene) was measured and the result was shown in Figure 5a. The as-prepared PGNW showed
excellent absorption capacity (ranging from 18 to 34 times its own
weight) for various tested oils or organic solvents, particularly
for toluene, which is a well-known toxic organic contaminant on the
water surface. Previous studies showed that the Q value of the absorbent was related to the density of oils.14,28 During the sorption process, the oils were penetrated into the 3D
network pores of PGNW, and when the porosity of PGNW was saturated
by oils, the density of penetrated oils determined the Q value of PGNW, and no swelling phenomenon was found during the whole
sorption process.

Figure 5 (a) Q values of PGNW for various oils
and organic
solvents, (b) Q values of PGNW with different contact
times with a variety of oils.

The absorption rate of PGNW for a variety of oils was also
studied
to further evaluate the oleophilicity of as-prepared PGNW. As shown
in Figure 5b, it has
been reported that the absorption rate was related to the viscosity
of oils.29 For example, it takes more time
to reach the Q value for high viscosity engine oil than low viscosity
kerosene, nevertheless, our PGNW could reach the Q value within 20 s for all tested oils (Figure 5b), thus showing ultrafast permeation speed
for the cleanup of various oils.

To further understand the wetting
behavior and absorption capacity
of as-prepared PGNW, an oil–water selective absorption experiment
was necessary. As shown in Figure 6, when a piece of PGNW was placed on the surface of
the kerosene/water mixture, kerosene on the water surface was immediately
absorbed into the 3D network pores of PGNW and completely removed
by PGNW within few seconds; then, pure water was left in the beaker,
while no red oil could be observed through the naked eye (Figure 6a–d). Similarly,
when a piece of PGNW was immersed into water by external force, a
mirror-like appearance on the surface of PGNW could be clearly seen,
which was attributed to the air cushion between water and the superhydrophobic
surface of PGNW. Once PGNW was forced into contact with chloroform
(dyed with Sudan III) under water, red chloroform was also immediately
removed by PGNW while repelling water (Figure 6e–h). From these images, both in air
or under water superhydrophobic–superoleophilic property of
as-prepared PGNW can be observed. Combined with prominent oil selectivity,
PGNW shows a great promising application for highly effective oil
collection.

the water surface (a–d) and chloroform under water (e–h)
(both of them were dyed with Sudan III) by PGNW.

2.2 Continuous Oil/Water Separation Testing of
PGNW-T
As mentioned above, the intermittent oil collection
process as an absorbent was still a less-effective way to oil/water
mixture treatment. Therefore, PGNW-T was designed and prepared for
achieving continuous oil collection, and the oil/water (include kerosene,
diesel, palm oil, and engine oil/water) separation process is shown
in Figure 7. When PGNW-T
was immersed into an oil/water mixture, the oil immediately permeated
into the 3D network pores of PGNW on PGNW-T. The absorbed oil could
be continuously collected into a suction flask along the pipes under
vacuum, which promoted that the oil around PGNW kept continuously
permeating into PGNW. In this case, continuous oil collection was
achieved while water could not enter into the 3D network pores of
PGNW on PGNW-T due to PGNW’s superhydrophobic property. As
shown in Figure 7,
a variety of oils could be continuously collected by PGNW-T, including
low viscosity kerosene, diesel, and, especially, high viscosity palm
oil and engine oil.

Figure 7 Photographs of continuous oil/water ((a)–(d) represent
kerosene,
diesel, palm oil, and engine oil/water mixture, respectively, kerosene
was dyed with Sudan III) separation process using PGNW-T.

To further access the oil collection process using
PGNW-T, oil
flux and oil/water separation efficiency were measured and the results
are shown in Figure 8. The separation efficiencies of PGNW-T for all tested oils were
all above 90% and could reach up to 97.14% for kerosene; meanwhile,
the maximum oil flux was 18 799.94 L/m2 h. Movie S1 recorded the kerosene/water separation
process using PGNW-T, and it took only 15 s to accomplish 500 mL kerosene/water
mixture separation, showing ultrafast oil collection ability and excellent
oil/water separation efficiency.

Figure 8 Oil/water separation efficiency and flux
of PGNW-T for various
oils.

In the practical oil/water treatment
process, the oil spills or
industrial oily wastewater generally contain highly corrosive components
such as acids, alkalies, or salts, which may destroy the microstructures
of samples and further weaken their oil/water separation ability.
To study the corrosion resistance of as-prepared PGNW-T, the oil/water
separation test that involves 250 mL of kerosene and 250 mL of 1 mol/L
HCl (dyed with methylene blue), and NaOH (dyed with rhodamine B) or
salt solution was carried out. As shown in Figure 9, PGNW-T was immersed into kerosene/acid,
kerosene/alkali, or kerosene/salt solution mixture, respectively.
Once the vacuum system starts up, kerosene was continuously collected
in the suction flask, whereas acid, alkali, or salt solution was repelled
and remained in the cylinder. Finally, the oil/water separation efficiency
could reach up to 97, 97.02, and 97.12%, respectively, and no significant
decline of oil/water separation efficiency occurred.

Figure 9 Photographs of the (a)
kerosene/1 mol/L HCl solution (dyed with
methylene blue) mixture separation process, (b) kerosene/ 1 mol/L
NaOH solution (dyed with rhodamine B) mixture separation process,
and (c) kerosene/1 mol/L NaCl solution mixture separation process,
where the kerosene was dyed with Sudan III.

Reusability under different environment conditions (including
acid,
alkali, or salt conditions) was also extremely important in practical
application. To investigate the recyclability of PGNW-T, the oil/water
separation test for kerosene/distilled water, kerosene/1 mol/L HCl
solution, kerosene/1 mol/L NaOH solution, kerosene/1 mol/L NaCl solution
was repeated 10 times, respectively, and the oil/water separation
efficiency was calculated for each group of test. As shown in Figure 10, there is no significant
decrease of oil/water separation efficiency during 10 cycles even
under strong acid, strong alkali, and salt conditions. The separation
efficiencies of PGNW-T all remained above 96% after 10 cycles, and
the stable oil collection ability of PGNW-T was contributed by the
strong interfacial bonding between the GE sheet and PET nonwoven.
The result showed not only the excellent recyclability but also superior
corrosion resistance ability of PGNW-T.

Figure 10 Reusability of PGNW-T
under different environment conditions.

The above results show the outstanding oil/water separation
ability
of PGNW-T, but in practical oil-spill accidents, the oil spill generally
spread around very fast and a thin oil film was easily formed on the
water surface. In particular, this thin oil film needs to be collected
immediately to alleviate further detriment. Apparently, the vertical
insertion of PGNW-T to treat oil spills is a relatively less-effective
method because of its limited contact area with oils. If PGNW-T could
float on the water surface horizontally and move freely on the water
surface for oil spill treatment, its valid contact area with oils
could be dramatically improved, and that must make our PGNW-T more
efficacious and more flexible to deal with the thin oil film on the
water surface. Herein, a miniature device based on PGNW-T was developed
to continuously collect thin oil films on the water surface, and its
structure diagram is shown in Figure 11. A water tank (500 mm × 200 mm × 150 mm)
which contained 9000 mL of water and 250 mL of kerosene spreading
on its surface was employed to simulate actual oil spill on the water
surface. Two PGNW-Ts were floated on the kerosene/water interface,
which were combined with a joint and connected with a vacuum system,
and driven by a drive motor.

Figure 11 Structure diagram of a continuous thin oil
film collection device.

Once startup, the continuous thin oil film collection process
can
be achieved (Figure 12). Specifically, when turning on the switch, the floated PGNW-T could
continuously collect a thin kerosene film into a suction flask through
vacuum pressure while repelling water and automatically move on the
surface of the kerosene/water mixture to “catch up”
the floated oil, at the same time. It only took 150 s to collect 250
mL of kerosene into the suction flask thoroughly, and finally no red
kerosene could be observed on the water surface, showing excellent
thin oil film collection ability.

Figure 12 Continuous thin oil film collection process
by the miniature device.

To further simulate the practical oil-spill collection process
by the miniature device, a variety of oils (including palm oil, kerosene,
and diesel) and organic solvents (including xylene, butyl acrylate,
methyl methacrylate, benzene, toluene, and nonanol), which were commonly
used in industrial processes and frequently transported through the
marine system, or the well-known toxic organic contaminants were all
chosen to the spilled-oil collection ability testing of our device.
First, 250 mL of the above-mentioned oils were poured onto 9000 mL
of the water surface and kept stationary for 120 s to form a thin
oil film on the water surface; then, the system was turned on and
the thin oil films were collected by the miniature device. As shown
in Figure 13, all
of the tested oils were successfully collected by our device with
the separation efficiency of above 83%, and the maximum was up to
95.3%, confirming the outstanding spilled-oil collection ability of
our miniature device towards various oils and organic solvents. In
addition, the miniature device was extremely facile to scale up to
deal with practical oil-spill accidents by increased PGNW-Ts to be
suitable for different occasions, showing its huge potential application
in practical oil-spill remediation.

Figure 13 Separation efficiency of various oil
and organic solvents by the
miniature device.

In summary, a novel
GE-coated PET nonwoven hollow tube was fabricated
for continuous and highly effective oil collection from the water
surface. The PGNW was obtained via a dip-spray coating method, which
possessed superhydrophobicity–superoleophilicity and could
absorb a variety of oils or organic solvents with the Q value of 18–34 times its own weight, then the PGNW-T was
formed through winding the PGNW on the surface of the porous PP hollow
tube. As-prepared PGNW-T was competent for dynamic oil collection
from the oil/water mixture with high flux (up to 18 799.94
L/m2 h), outstanding separation efficiency (up to 97.14%),
and excellent recyclability (>96% after 10 cycles), the exceptional
corrosion resistance ability was also provided for practical application.
Furthermore, a miniature device based on PGNW-T was developed for
continuous thin oil film collection, which shows excellent collection
ability for various floated oils and organic solvents. Our strategy
is easy to scale up and may provide a new solution for dealing with
large-area oil spill remediation.

3 Experimental
Details
3.1 Materials
GE (sheet size: 7–10
μm, 1–3 layer) and PET nonwoven (140 g/m2,
thickness = 5 mm) were purchased from Xiamen Knano Graphene Technology
Co., Ltd., Xiamen and Handan Hengyong Protective & Clean Products
Co., Ltd., Handan, respectively. PVDF (Solef 6010) was obtained from
Solvay Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Shanghai. The PP hollow tube (diameter
= 10 mm, wall thickness = 2 mm) was provided by Suzhou Wolong Plastic
Product Co., Ltd., Suzhou. N,N-Dimethylacetamide
(DMAc), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
ethyl alcohol, and chloroform were purchased from Tianji Kermel Chemical
Reagents Co., Ltd., Tianjin. Xylene, butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate,
benzene, toluene, and nonanol were obtained from Aladdin Reagent Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai. Kerosene and diesel were obtained from Tianjin Kailida
Chemical Co., Ltd., Tianjin. Engine oil, palm oil, pump oil, and soybean
oil were purchased from local store. All reagents were used as received
without further purification.

3.2 Preparation
of GE-Coated PET Nonwoven (PGNW)
The fabrication process
of PGNW is shown in Figure 14. Typically, 2 g of GE and 1000 mL of ethyl
alcohol were mixed in a beaker and then subjected to ultrasonic treatment
for 2 h to get a uniform GE dispersion. Then, 1 g of PVDF was dissolved
in 50 mL of DMAc with vigorous stirring at 70 °C for 2 h to form
a homogenous PVDF/DMAc solution. PET nonwoven was first cleaned by
distilled water and then dried in a drum wind drying oven at 70 °C
for 6 h to completely remove the moisture. The resultant PET nonwoven
was dipped into the above-mentioned GE dispersion for 60 s and dried
in the oven at 70 °C for 2 h, and GE-coated PET nonwoven was
obtained. Repeat the dipping and drying process above for adjusting
the amount of GE loading on PET nonwoven. To enhance the adhesion
of the GE sheet on PET nonwoven, the above-mentioned PVDF/DMAc solution
was then sprayed onto the PET nonwoven which underwent three times
the dipping and drying process (GNW) using a spray gun (0.1 MPa compressed
air gas, both sides were sprayed for 10 s), after drying in the drum
wind drying oven at 60 °C for 48 h to allow the solvent to be
removed completely, and PGNW was obtained.

Figure 14 Scheme for the fabrication
process of PGNW.

3.3 Preparation
of the PGNW Hollow Tube (PGNW-T)
A piece of as-prepared PGNW
(100 mm × 100 mm) was wrapped
on a porous PP hollow tube (150 mm), which was obtained by drilling
the holes on the surface of the PP hollow tube (diameter of holes
= 0.5 mm, spacing of each holes = 0.5 mm) through a bench drill, both
sides of the PP hollow tube were reserved 30 mm nonporous area for
joint connection. The edge of the PGNW wrapped on the PP hollow tube
was sealed, and finally, PGNW-T was obtained. The preparation process
of PGNW-T is shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15 Scheme for the fabrication process of PGNW-T.

3.4 Characterization
The morphology of
the samples was observed by FESEM (S4800, Hitachi). WCA and OCA were
measured on an optical contact angle meter (model DSA100, KRUSS) by
dropping water and oil droplets (2 μL) onto the samples at ambient
temperature, and five positions of each sample were measured. The
surface chemistries of the samples were characterized by XPS (K-alpha,
Thermo Scientific,); the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV was used for adjusting
the binging energies. The Q value was measured by
the following process: a piece of PGNW (0.2 g) was immersed into different
oils or organic solvents (including engine oil, pump oil, soybean
oil, palm oil, butyl acrylate, DMF, diesel, kerosene, and toluene)
until saturation, then the saturated PGNW was placed on a strainer
for 1 min, and finally weighed. The Q (g/g) value
of PGNW was calculated according to eq 1(36−38) 1  where ms and mi are the weight of PGNW before and after absorption
(g), respectively.

3.5 Continuous Oil/Water Separation
Test of PGNW-T
A continuous oil/water separation test via
PGNW-T was conducted
using a laboratory-scale experimental setup (Figure 16), and the dead-end vacuum-pressure filtration
method was carried out as previously described.39 Briefly, 250 mL of oils (including kerosene, diesel, engine
oil, and palm oil) was poured into a 500-mL measuring cylinder containing
250 mL of water, and then the mixture was kept stationary for 120
s to form a hierarchical oil/water mixture. A length of PGNW-T with
one-end sealed was then dipped into the mixture, and then connected
to a vacuum system (by suction flask, vacuum meter, valve and vacuum
pump) for continuous oil collection under vacuum pressure (−5
kPa). Oil/water separation efficiency was calculated as in eq 2 2  where η is
the oil/water separation
efficiency (%), Vb is the volume of oil
before separation (mL), Va is the volume
of collected oil after separation (mL), and Vw is the volume of collected water after separation (mL).

Figure 16 Schematic
diagram of the continuous oil/water separation apparatus
based on PGNW-T.

To determine the oil
flux of PGNW-T during the separation process,
oils were continuously poured into a cylinder so that PGNW-T could
be always submerged by oils (Figure 16). The permeation flux was calculated according to eq 3 3  where J is the oil flux (L/m2 h), V is the total volume of the collected
oil (L), A is the effective contact area of PGNW-T
with oils (m2), and T is the operation
time (h). All of the experiments were performed in triplicate.
