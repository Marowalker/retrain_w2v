The
rapid formation of the protein corona on to the nanoparticle
(NP) surface is the key that confers biological identity to NPs and
subsequently dictates their fate both in vitro and in vivo. Despite
significant efforts, the inability to control the spontaneous interaction
of serum proteins with the administered NPs remains a major constraint
in clinical translation of nanomedicines. The ligands present on the
NP surface offer promise in controlling their biological interactions;
however, their influence on the NP–protein interaction is not
well-understood. The current study investigates the potential of phytochemical-capped
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) toward allowing a control over NP interactions
with the human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in the
biological fluids. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability of curcumin
(Cur) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to independently act as
reducing agents to produce phytochemical-capped AgNPs that show biologically
desirable interactions with HSA. The key finding of our study is that
the phytochemical-capped AgNPs initially interact with HSA more strongly
compared to the citrate-stabilized AgNPs; however, the resultant NP–HSA
complexes are less stable in the case of the former, which causes
a lesser degree of changes in the protein conformation during interactions.
Further, the choice of the phytochemical allows control over NP–HSA
interactions, such that Cur- and EGCG-capped AgNPs interacted with
HSA in a static versus dynamic manner, respectively. The diversity
of the functional groups present in natural phytochemicals and their
potential as in situ capping ligands during synthesis offer new opportunities
in controlling the interactions of NPs with complex biological fluids,
with implications in nanodiagnostics and nanomedicine.

==== Body
Introduction
The unique physicochemical
and broad spectrum antibacterial and
antifungal properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have made them
one of the most incorporated nanomaterials in the consumer and medical
products to date.1,2 However, on administering these
NPs into the blood stream, they first come into contact with proteins
found in the plasma.3 These plasma proteins
readily interact with the surface of the NPs forming a protein corona
(PC).4 This initial interaction between
the NPs and plasma proteins changes the properties of the NPs, and
as such, this has remarkable impact on altering the mechanism of NP
interaction with the target organs.5 Hence,
distribution and biological responses of the NPs in the body are dictated
by this PC because this altered configuration of NPs is what that
is perceived when the NPs first come in contact with the target cells.4,6,7 The NPs, in turn, can also change
the conformation of the plasma proteins they interact with, possibly
altering the function of these proteins.1 Hence, when considering the use of NPs for in vivo purposes, it
is important to understand and control these interactions of NPs with
proteins in the blood stream.

Albumins are the most abundant
proteins found in the human serum,
at a concentration of 769 μM/L.8 Human
serum albumin (HSA) contains 585 amino acid residues, and it serves
as an important carrier for many substances such as fatty acids, bilirubins,
hormones, and exogenous and endogenous ligands.9 Because HSA possesses so many important physiological functions,
any change to its structure can prove detrimental to its normal functioning
in the body.1,10,11 Hence, it is important to study the interaction of NPs with this
protein. In particular, HSA contains a single tryptophan (Trp-214)
residue in the hydrophobic cavity of its sub-domain IIA (Sudlow I).
This Trp residue is capable of producing strong intrinsic fluorescence
and therefore serves as an excellent reporter for ligand binding and
conformational studies.1,12

Notably, while there are
some studies that have utilized human
serum or simulated complex biological environments,13,14 most studies that have looked at NP–protein interactions
have utilized bovine serum albumin (BSA)3,6,15−18 instead of HSA. However, one important difference
between BSA and HSA is the presence of two tryptophan residues in
BSA, whereas HSA has a single unique tryptophan residue.12,19 Owing to this inherent difference, these two proteins may show different
binding interactions with NPs. For instance, Gelamo and Tabak19 noted that in the presence of various ionic
surfactants, BSA evinced fluorescence quenching, whereas HSA led to
an enhancement of the fluorescence with the same ionic surfactants.
Manivel and Anandan2 also observed that
BSA can exhibit higher binding with NPs than HSA. This supports that
BSA is not a reliable substitute for HSA, especially when employing
fluorescence for fundamental interaction studies. As such, in contrast
to a serum protein of bovine origin, HSA offers a more appropriate
platform to study and understand the NP interactions in the human
context. Hence, our current study focuses on studying the interaction
of HSA with NPs to obtain insights into the likely fate of NPs in
the human blood/serum.

On the other hand, the NP surface characteristics,
viz., the biomolecules
or phytochemicals present on the surface, may also affect the degree
and type of serum protein interactions. Isolated phytochemicals, such
as curcumin,20 epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG),21 and various flavonoids,22 have been observed to show interactions with
serum. However, the study of the interaction of phytochemical-coated
NPs remains elusive. It is important to study the direct interaction
of phytochemical-coated NPs with serum proteins, as it is not uncommon
for the functional groups of the phytochemicals to be modified during
the process of NP synthesis and capping.23 This altered structure of phytochemical bound onto the NP surface
could in turn influence the mode of interactions with serum proteins.
It is also a focus of our current study to understand how this change
in the phytochemical structure might affect the interaction of these
NPs with proteins in the blood. To obtain insights into these fundamental
questions, we utilize curcumin and EGCG phytochemicals found in turmeric
and green tea, respectively, to synthesize AgNPs and elucidate their
physicochemical interactions with HSA. We chose curcumin and EGCG
as ligands in the current study, as these two phytochemicals have
been actively investigated for their therapeutic potential. For instance,
EGCG has been recently exploited as a ligand to selectively target
Laminin-67 receptor, a protein overexpressed on the surface of prostate
cancer cells.24 The EGCG functionalization
on the surface of gold NPs led to selective uptake of these NPs into
cancer cells which could be employed for therapeutic purpose. Similarly,
the use of curcumin-based nanoformulations has been actively proposed
for a number of biomedical applications ranging from therapy of cancer
to cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, inflammations,
and neurological disorders.25

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of Phytochemical-Coated AgNPs
Phytochemical-coated
AgNPs were synthesized and characterized by
UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta-potential measurements. Figure 1A–C compares
the UV–vis absorbance spectra of the as-synthesised AgNPs using
different reducing agents and those obtained after dialysis to remove
potentially unutilized precursors. AgNPs obtained using citrate, curcumin,
and EGCG as reducing agents have been referred as Ct-AgNPs, Cur-AgNPs,
and EGCG-AgNPs throughout this study. The as-synthesized AgNPs display
characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bands ca. 405–416
nm (408 nm for Ct-AgNPs, 416 nm for Cur-AgNPs, and 406 nm for EGCG-AgNPs).3,26 Additional absorption features are observed at ca. 260–280
nm only in the case of phytochemical-stabilized NPs. Supporting Information Figure S1 shows the absorbance features
of curcumin at 263 and 417 nm27 and EGCG
at 235 and 273 nm.28 Hence, the 263 nm
peak for Cur–AgNPs and the 273 nm peak for EGCG-AgNPs can be
ascribed to the electronic transitions from the benzene ring present
in these phytochemicals. Subsequent to the dialysis performed on these
NPs, the free phytochemicals are removed, leading to a decrease in
the intensity of the absorption peaks corresponding to these phytochemicals.
The high intensity absorption peak observed ca. 209 nm in the case
of Ct-AgNPs possibly stems from the citrate on the NPs because trisodium
citrate shows an absorption band at 209 nm (Supporting Information Figure S1).29 The resulting
absorbance features seen in the UV range of the spectra after dialysis
stem from the citrate and phytochemicals firmly bound to the surface
of AgNPs.

(Syn) and post-dialysis (Dia) nanoparticles and corresponding post-dialysis
TEM images (D–F) of Ct-AgNPs (A,D), Cur-AgNPs (B,E), and EGCG-AgNPs
(C,F).

The phytochemical-coated AgNPs
as well as Ct-AgNPs were of narrow
size distribution with a mean diameter of 10–20 nm, as confirmed
by TEM (Figure 1D–F).
Previous studies have noted that NPs <50 nm in diameter are readily
internalized into cells,30 suggesting that
AgNPs used in the current study are in an appropriate size range for
potential biological applications. The hydrodynamic diameters for
Ct-AgNPs, Cur-AgNPs, and EGCG-AgNPs were recorded to be 55.6, 44.8,
and 61.5 nm, respectively; and the corresponding zeta potentials were
−25.9, −41.3, and −38.9 mV (Supporting Information, Table S1).

As a preliminary
method of determining the interaction of HSA with
AgNPs, the changes in the DLS and zeta potential of NPs were monitored
in the presence and absence of HSA. The hydrodynamic diameters of
AgNPs increase in the presence of HSA, accompanied with a concomitant
decrease in the zeta potential (Supporting Information, Table S1). The Ct-AgNPs and EGCG-AgNPs show 10% increase in the
hydrodynamic diameter in the presence of HSA, while Cur-AgNPs show
a 30% increase. This indicates that Cur-AgNPs have a greater degree
of interactions with HSA over the other two NP types. Brewer et al.16 have noted that a decrease in the zeta potential
indicates the binding of BSA to the surface of the NPs. In the current
case, we observe that zeta potentials of all the three NP systems
decrease on exposure to HSA, indicating that HSA binds to the surface
of all three AgNPs forming a PC. The mechanism of these interactions
is investigated further below.

Absorption Characteristics
of AgNP Interactions with HSA
An increase in the absorption
intensity of serum albumins with the
increasing NP concentration has been attributed to a complex formation
between these proteins and NPs and has been used as an indicator of
the type of interactions between NPs and serum proteins.1,3,11 As such, the interaction of a
fixed amount of HSA with increasing concentrations of different AgNPs
was initially investigated by monitoring the absorption features of
HSA at ca. 279 nm. The results in Figure 2A–C show an increase in the intensity
and blue shift in the HSA peak at 279 nm with the increasing AgNPs
concentration beyond a certain minimal concentration threshold. This
suggests the possibility of ground state complex formation between
AgNPs and HSA because dynamic collisions only affect the excited states
of the molecules and have no effect on the absorption spectra.15 Similar effects of NPs on HSA absorption have
been previously observed. Overall, the increase in the intensity of
these interactions is significantly greater with phytochemical-coated
AgNPs over Ct-AgNPs, and Cur-AgNPs show stronger interactions with
HSA over EGCG-AgNPs. These observations, coupled with the DLS and
zeta potential studies (Supporting Information Table S1), suggest that the phytochemical surface coating on AgNPs
plays a significant role in influencing their interaction with serum
proteins.

AgNPs (1.2 μM) on exposure to HSA (3 μM). (A,D) Ct-AgNPs,
(B,E) Cur-AgNPs, and (C,F) EGCG-AgNPs.

To further assess whether binding of HSA to the surface of
AgNPs
causes any NP aggregation, the SPR absorption features of AgNPs at
c.a. 400 nm were also monitored in the presence of HSA (Figure 2D–F). The SPR peaks
observed at 412 nm (Cur-AgNPs) and 406 nm (EGCG-AgNPs) marginally
red-shifted to 413 and 412 nm, respectively, while the 416 nm Ct-AgNPs
peak showed no significant change. The red shifts in the SPR peaks of the NPs indicate an increase in the
overall NP hydrodynamic size, which further supports the DLS and zeta
potential measurements (Supporting Information Table S1); because of phytochemical binding, the hydrodynamic diameter
of AgNPs increases without causing NP aggregation.

Fluorescence
Characteristics of AgNPs Interaction with HSA
The Trp-214
residue in HSA is highly sensitive to the changes in
its microenvironment, thereby providing the intrinsic fluorescence
emission of Trp as a good indicator of HSA interactions with other
species.31 Quenching or decrease in the
fluorescence intensity may indicate a variety of interactions such
as molecular rearrangement, collisional quenching, or ground state
complex formation.3,7 HSA showed an emission band at
346 nm on excitation at 295 nm, while AgNPs showed no fluorescence
emission at this wavelength, indicating the absence of overlapping
fluorescence spectra from the AgNPs (Figure 3). The HSA concentration was maintained constant
at 3 μM, whereas the AgNP concentration was varied between 0
and 240 μM. These concentrations were chosen to mimic a variety
of potential NP exposure scenarios, such that either the protein concentration
is up to 30 times greater than that of the AgNPs or the AgNP concentration
is 80 times greater than the protein concentration.

of a fixed concentration of HSA (3 μM) with an increasing concentration
of AgNPs (0–240 μM). HSA in the figure corresponds to
the equivalent concentration of HSA (3 μM) without nanoparticles.

fits in GraphPad Prism 7.02 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). (A) Ct-AgNPs,
(B) Cur-AgNPs, and (C) EGCG-AgNPs.

As shown in Figure 3A–C, in the presence of increasing concentrations of
AgNPs,
the Trp fluorescence was quenched in a NP concentration-dependent
manner, with the largest degree of quenching caused by Cur-AgNPs,
followed by EGCG-AgNPs and the least quenching observed with Ct-AgNPs.
Because the efficiency of quenching depends on the proximity of the
quencher to the fluorophore,17 these results
indicate that the AgNPs (quencher in the current case) bind to the
HSA molecule (fluorophore in the current case) at or near its Trp
residue in the subdomain IIA. Another interesting observation is an
increasing blue shift in the fluorescence spectra of HSA with the
increasing AgNP concentration. This shift in the fluorescence emission
indicates a concentration-dependent effect of AgNPs on HSA, such that
its chromophore (Trp residue) has been brought into a more hydrophobic
surrounding.1,11,32 To validate the role of the hydrophobic environment on blue shifts
of HSA fluorescence signatures, we performed additional experiments,
wherein a fixed amount of HSA in the phosphate buffer was independently
exposed to increasingly higher concentrations (v/v wrt water) of less
polar solvents such as methanol and ethanol. It is clear from Figure
S2 (Supporting Information) that the hydrophobic
environment leads to the blue shift in the HSA fluorescence peaks.
Another interesting observation was that HSA fluorescence increased
in the presence of a nonpolar environment. This increase in fluorescence
with the alcohols could be due to the change in the protein structure,
exposing the tryptophan molecule; however, with the AgNPs, this was
not observed because of interactions of the AgNPs at or near the tryptophan.
This supports our findings that the blue shift is due to the change
in the hydrophobicity of the protein structure. Overall, these results
signify that the AgNPs are capable of altering the structure of the
HSA molecules.

From the fluorescence data, the dissociation
constants (Kd) of HSA–AgNP interactions
were calculated
to determine the affinity of AgNPs with HSA (Figure 3D).26 It is clear
that the affinity of HSA toward Cur-AgNPs is the highest with a Kd of 2.9 μM, followed by EGCG-AgNPs (8.55
μM) and Ct-AgNPs (28.99 μM). In particular, Cur-AgNPs
and EGCG-AgNPs show 10 and 3 times higher affinity toward HSA over
Ct-AgNPs. These high affinities for Cur-AgNPs and EGCG-AgNPs to HSA
are similar to the affinity observed with polyethylene glycol and
glucose coated FePt NPs to HSA,33−35 while the Ct-AgNPs are closer
to the low affinity observed with polyacrylic acid-coated CdSe/ZnS
NPs.33,34 This supports that the nature of the capping
agent over the NP surface plays a significant role in determining
their interactions with serum proteins. Notably, while quenching of
fluorescence emission during NP–protein interactions has been
previously observed,1−3,11,15,31 these studies have been restricted
to studying a single type of NP, without considering the role of the
surface corona.

It is acknowledged that free curcumin and EGCG
molecules are known
to show a phytochemical concentration-dependent increase in HSA fluorescence
quenching.36,37 However, interactions of pristine
phytochemicals with HSA lead to red shifts in the fluorescence emission,
which is indicative of shifts toward a more polar environment.37 This is in contrast to phytochemical-coated
AgNPs in the current case, where a blue shift (shifts toward a more
nonpolar environment) in fluorescence emission is observed. Further,
it was previously noted38 that the hydroxyl
groups on the galloyl moiety and on the B-ring of pristine EGCG are
responsible for interactions with HSA. In the current case involving
NPs, if the FTIR spectra of the Cur-AgNPs and EGCG-AgNPs are considered
(Supporting Information Figure S3), a change
in the phenolic groups of the phytochemicals on the surface of the
AgNPs is observed. This supports the fact that the chemical structures
of phytochemicals change during reduction of Ag+ ions and
simultaneous surface capping of AgNPs. Therefore, it is not surprising
that the interaction of phytochemical-coated AgNPs with HSA is not
necessarily the same as the previously observed interaction of pristine
phytochemicals with serum proteins. The authors recommend caution
in making generalized predictions toward biological applicability
of nanomaterials with a similar inorganic core but different surface
cappings, or predicting the biological response of nanomaterials solely
on the basis of the properties of pristine capping agents.

Fluorescence
Quenching Mechanism
An interaction between
a fluorophore and a quencher may undergo one of the two types of quenching
mechanisms, viz., dynamic (or collisional) quenching and static quenching
(or complex formation). Dynamic quenching occurs when a fluorophore
in an excited state is deactivated when it remains in contact with
the quencher, whereas static quenching occurs when the quencher and
the fluorophore form a nonfluorescent ground state complex.3,26 These two types of quenching can be differentiated by studying the
interactions as a function of temperature. In a dynamic quenching
scenario, when temperature is increased, diffusion of molecules occurs
at a faster rate, leading to the ongoing interactions between the
quencher and the fluorophore. Conversely, in a static quenching scenario,
the nonfluorescent ground state complex remains stable with the increasing
temperature.

Fluorescence emission spectra of HSA with increasing
concentrations of AgNPs were obtained at temperatures ranging from
20 to 60 °C (293–333 K). To determine the mechanism of
quenching, the data were analyzed for the quenching constant using
the Stern–Volmer eq 1 1  where F0 and F denote the fluorescence intensities in the absence and
the presence of the quencher (AgNPs), respectively, [Q] is the concentration
of AgNPs, and KSV is the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant.3

The Stern–Volmer
quenching plots for the AgNPs are shown
in Figure 4, and the
corresponding Stern–Volmer quenching constants are displayed
in Tables 1, 2, and S2 (Supporting Information) for Cur-AgNPs, EGCG-AgNPs, and Ct-AgNPs, respectively. The KSV values for Cur-AgNPs show a consistent decrease
with the increasing temperature from 30 to 60 °C (Table 1). This indicates that the quenching
mechanism is predominantly due to static binding of HSA to Cur-AgNPs
because a decrease in KSV with an increasing
temperature indicates complex formation or static quenching.1,3,39 The KSV values for EGCG-AgNPs, on the other hand, decrease only in the 40–60
°C range with the increasing temperature, whereas at a lower
temperature range (20–40 °C), an increase in KSV is observed (Table 2). This suggests that at the
physiological temperature of 37 °C, EGCG-AgNPs exhibit dynamic
quenching. However, as temperature increases, there is an evidence
of static quenching. Notably, even in the case of Cur-AgNPs, an increase
in KSV indicative of dynamic quenching
is observed at lower temperatures (20–30 °C). The comparisons
between two phytochemical-coated AgNPs at the physiological temperature
suggests that Cur-AgNPs interact more strongly with HSA through a
static complex formation, in contrast to EGCG-AgNPs, whose interactions
with HSA are less stable because of dynamic interactions. In contrast
to phytochemical-coated AgNPs, citrate-capped NPs show dynamic interactions
with HSA across the wider temperature range of 20–60 °C.

Further extension of the Stern–Volmer equation allows calculation
of the biomolecular quenching rate constant (kq) as shown in eq 2 2  where KSV is the
Stern–Volmer quenching constant, kq is the biomolecular quenching rate constant, and τ0 is the average lifetime of the fluorophore without the quencher. F0 and F denote the fluorescence
intensities in the absence and the presence of the quencher (AgNPs),
respectively, whereas [Q] is the concentration of AgNPs.3

The fluorescence lifetime of the HSA is
10–8 s
(τ0)3, and kq is calculated using the formula KSV/τ0. In the case of dynamic quenching, the maximum possible scatter
quenching collision constant of various quenchers with the biopolymer
is 2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1.3,18 The kq values obtained
for all the three NPs are in the order of 1013 M–1 s–1 (Tables 1 and 2 and Supporting Information Table S2), which are 3 orders of magnitude
higher over the diffusion-controlled values encountered during dynamic
interactions. This implies that at least to a finite extent, the AgNP–HSA
complex is formed in the case of all NPs, leading to a degree of static
interactions.11 The Cur-AgNPs show the
highest kq values, followed by EGCG-AgNPs
and Ct-AgNPs, suggesting that the degree of static interactions between
AgNPs and HSA is the largest in the case of Cur-AgNPs. Similarly,
the KSV values also indicated that the
contribution of the static interactions was the largest in Cur-AgNPs
(30–60 °C), followed by EGCG-AgNPs (40–60 °C),
whereas Ct-AgNPs did not show evidence of static interactions. These
studies, in combination, suggest that phytochemical-coated AgNPs show
a complex interplay between dynamic and static interactions with HSA,
such that interactions of HSA with Cur-AgNPs seem to be significantly
stronger than those with EGCG-AgNPs.

Binding Constant and Thermodynamic
Parameters
The double
logarithmic regression curves of log[(F0 −F)/F] versus log[Q] were
plotted for the AgNPs, the intercept of which gives K, the binding constant (Supporting Information Figure S4). These binding constants are shown in Tables 1, 2,
and S2 (Supporting Information) for Cur-AgNPs,
EGCG-AgNPs, and Ct-AgNPs, respectively. The K value
for Ct-AgNPs shows an increase with the temperature, indicating that
the binding capacity increases as the temperature rises, and a similar
observation has been made previously in the case of BSA interactions
with citrate-capped AgNPs.3 The value of K decreases with the increasing temperature for both the
phytochemical-coated AgNPs, and this indicates a reduction in binding
capacity with a concomitant rise in the temperature. Despite the Kd values (Figure 3D) indicating high affinity of Cur-AgNPs and EGCG-AgNPs
toward HSA, the decrease in the binding constant with temperature
signifies the instability of the AgNPs–HSA complex in these
cases.39,40

To determine the thermodynamic forces
and the nature of binding of AgNPs to HSA, van’t Hoff plots
were used (Supporting Information, Figure
S5). Because Ct-AgNPs exhibited a linear van’t Hoff plot (Figure S5A), the changes in enthalpy and entropy
were determined using the following equation 3  where K is the binding constant
at the corresponding temperature (T) in Kelvin; R is the gas constant (8.314 J K–1 mol–1); and ΔH° and ΔS° correspond to the changes in enthalpy and entropy,
respectively.3 However, because the trend
for Cur-AgNPs and EGCG-AgNPs (Figure S5B,C) deviated from the linear dependence, polynomial equations were
utilized as described previously.41 The
dependence of ln K on 1/T can be
reduced to the quadratic form with three parameters (α0, α1, and α2), which is represented
in a polynomial equation as follows 4  

Using these regression parameters,
the thermodynamic parameters
were calculated using the following equations41 5   6  and the Gibbs free
energy (ΔG°) was determined using the
equation 7  

The nature of interactions
between HSA and AgNPs can be determined
from the changes in the enthalpy and entropy of the overall system.
When ΔH° and ΔS° are both less than zero, such systems are dominated with van
der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds; when ΔH° and ΔS° are both greater than
0, this is characteristic of a system rich in hydrophobic forces;
whereas when ΔH° < 0 and ΔS° > 0, this represents the system stabilized by
electrostatic
forces.3,18 Negative ΔG°
values indicate a spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable process.3,18 As such, the thermodynamic parameters obtained for Cur-AgNPs, EGCG-AgNPs,
and Ct-AgNPs are displayed in Tables 1 and 2, and in Supporting Information Table S2, respectively. On the basis
of these thermodynamic parameters, both the phytochemical-coated AgNPs
exhibit hydrophobic interactions with HSA, and these interactions
are thermodynamically favorable at ambient temperatures. However,
with the increasing temperature, the interactions lose their spontaneity
(positive ΔG°), and the van der Waals
and hydrogen bonding start playing the major role in AgNP–HSA
interactions. Pristine phytochemicals have also been previously observed
to interact with HSA through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds,12,37 indicating that as the interaction temperature increases, the phytochemicals
bound onto the NP surface obtain a greater degree of freedom to interact
with the serum proteins in a manner that they interact in their free
states. This also affirms that the surface coatings of NPs do play
an important role in determining their interactions with the serum
proteins. In contrast, Ct-AgNPs without any phytochemical coating
(Supporting Information, Table S2) show
a consistent behavior across a broader temperature range, which support
a spontaneous thermodynamically favourable interaction with HSA molecules
dominated by hydrophobic forces. This observation is in line with
previous studies on citrate-capped NPs.3 Overall, a comparison between citrate- and phytochemicals-coated
AgNPs suggests that while the latter do bind to HSA, the binding is
less favorable than the interactions between Ct-AgNPs and HSA.

Effect
of AgNPs on the Secondary Structure of HSA
Circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy provides a convenient method for assessing
the changes in the secondary structure, conformation, and stability
of proteins in solution on interaction with NPs. Typically, the α-helices
of proteins exhibit two negative bands at 208 and 222 nm, contributed
by the π–π* and n−π* transitions of
the peptide bonds of the α-helix, respectively.1,40 The CD spectra of HSA in the presence and absence of AgNPs are shown
in Figure 5. The α-helix
was calculated from the mean residue ellipticity (MRE) values at 208
nm using the following equation 8  where Cp is the
molar concentration of the protein, n is the number
of amino acid residues in HSA (585), and l is the
path length (0.1 cm).40 The percentage
of α-helix content was calculated using the equation 9  where MRE208 is the observed MRE
at 208 nm, 4000 is the MRE of the β-form and random coil conformation
cross at 208 nm, and 33 000 is the MRE value of a pure α-helix
at 208 nm.40

Figure 5 CD spectra of HSA in
the absence and the presence of the AgNPs.

The α-helix content, as obtained from CD spectroscopy
of
HSA in the phosphate buffer, showed a reduction from 44.4% in the
case of free HSA to 38.6, 41.8, and 42.4% in the presence of Ct-AgNPs,
Cur-AgNPs, and EGCG-AgNPs, respectively. This indicates that while
all three AgNPs show a reduction in the α-helices content of
HSA, the reduction with Ct-AgNPs was the greatest. Between the two
phytochemical-coated AgNPs, Cur-AgNPs showed greater reduction than
EGCG-AgNPs. The CD spectroscopy studies, therefore, support the fact
that the interaction of phytochemical-coated AgNPs with human serum
proteins causes fewer changes in the secondary structure of the protein,
compared to citrate-stabilized AgNPs.

Conclusions
Citrate
and sodium borohydride are the commonly employed reducing
agents to prepare metal NPs of gold and silver. In comparison, while
the use of phytochemicals to prepare metal NPs is not a common practice,
the antioxidant capability of a large group of phytochemicals offers
remarkable potential in their utility as “soft” reducing
agents for metal NP synthesis. The inherent biocompatibility of a
large number of these phytochemicals also has the potential to employ
phytochemical-coated NPs for a myriad of biomedical applications.
It is acknowledged that the interaction of sodium borohydride or citrate-capped
metal NPs with serum proteins has been widely studied, and that most
of these studies have focussed on BSA.1,3,16 There have been a selected few studies involving
phytochemicals; however, these studies have employed the whole plant
extracts for NP synthesis without using individual phytochemicals.11,15 These studies involving plant extracts for NP production do not
provide molecular-level interaction insights and may lack the necessary
aspects of quality control and precision manufacturing required for
the intended biomedical use. Therefore, this study has, for the first
time, obtained new insights into the human serum protein interactions
of two phytochemical-stabilized metal NPs (Cur-AgNPs and EGCG-AgNPs)
while comparing their performance with the widely reported Ct-AgNPs.

One of the key findings of our study is that the investigated phytochemical-capped
AgNPs initially interact with HSA more strongly compared to Ct-AgNPs;
however, the resultant NP–HSA complexes subsequently become
less stable in the case of the former, which causes a lesser degree
of changes in the protein conformation during interactions. Another
key difference observed between these two groups of AgNPs is that
while under ambient conditions, all three types of AgNPs interacted
with HSA predominantly via hydrophobic forces; however, with increasing
temperatures (including at the physiological temperature), phytochemical-stabilized
AgNPs showed a shift toward van der Waals and H-bonding interactions.
If compared within the phytochemical-capped group of AgNPs, while
Cur-AgNPs showed static interactions with HSA, the EGCG-AgNPs interacted
in a dynamic fashion. The outcomes of our study reveal that the use
of phytochemicals as NP surface ligands offers new opportunities in
controlling the interaction of NPs with complex biological fluids.
For instance, differential interactions of different surface coatings
of NPs with serum proteins have already been explored for developing
“chemical nose-tongue” sensors.8 It is also noted that the formation of a PC once a NP comes in contact
with biological fluids is a highly complex process. The current study
focussed on understanding the interaction of phytochemical-coated
NPs with HSA provides only a guiding tool, suggesting the potential
benefits of phytochemicals in controlling the formation of a PC. However,
further studies involving interactions of these NPs with complex fluids
and full plasma will need to be performed to obtain a more comprehensive
understanding of these interactions. Overall, the natural access to
a repertoire of phytochemical molecules with diverse functional groups
is likely to offer new opportunities in the field of nanodiagnostics
and nanomedicine.

Materials & Methods
Materials
Silver
sulphate (Ag2SO4), silver nitrate (AgNO3) curcumin, EGCG, potassium hydroxide
(KOH), HSA, monosodium phosphate (NaH2PO4),
disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4), and dialysis membrane
(12 kDa molecular weight cutoff) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). A dialysis membrane was used after
sensitizing by boiling in distilled water. All other materials were
used as purchased without further modification. Sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) was prepared by mixing 40.5 mL of 0.2 M Na2HPO4 with 9.5 mL of 0.2 M NaH2PO4 and made
up to a final volume of 100 mL. Deionized Milli-Q water was used for
all experiments.

AgNP Synthesis
The citrate-capped
AgNPs (Ct-AgNPs)
were synthesized using the citrate reduction method. Silver nitrate
(100 mL, 10 mM) was heated on a magnetic stirrer to 95 °C, and
2 mL of 1% trisodium citrate solution was added. The method of synthesis
of curcumin-reduced AgNPs (Cur-AgNPs) and EGCG-reduced AgNPs (EGCG-AgNPs)
was adapted from Selvakannan et al.23 To
synthesize Cur-AgNPs, curcumin was dissolved in 0.1 M KOH and added
to boiling water with equimolar aqueous silver sulphate solution.
EGCG-AgNPs were similarly prepared by adding equimolar concentrations
of aqueous silver sulphate and EGCG solutions followed by 0.1 M KOH.
Heating was continued until the solutions turned yellowish brown,
signifying the formation of AgNPs. The AgNPs were rotary-evaporated
at 70 hPa, with the water bath heated to 70 °C and concentrated
approximately to 10 times of the original concentration. The concentrated
solutions were dialyzed for 24 h against deionized water at room temperature
to remove excess KOH, unreduced metal ions, and/or unbound molecules,
if any.

Characterization of NPs
Synthesized AgNPs were characterized
by UV–vis spectroscopy using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer
(Australia) from 200 to 800 nm in a quartz cuvette with a path length
of 1 cm. The nanoparticle core size was assessed by TEM. TEM images
were obtained by drop-casting the dialyzed samples on carbon-coated
copper grids and imaged using the JEOL 1010 TEM (USA) instrument operated
at 100 kV. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of NPs were
measured using a Malvern Nano-Zetasizer (UK) at 25 °C. The samples
were loaded into a folded capillary cell for the zeta potential measurements.
The Smoluchowski methodology for aqueous media was employed, and a
maximum of 100 runs was performed.42 For
DLS, the samples were loaded into a polystyrene cuvette of 1 cm path
length. For HSA–AgNP interaction studies, the molar equivalent
concentration of Ag in AgNPs was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy
using a Varian PerkinElmer atomic absorption spectrometer. Throughout
this study, the indicated AgNP concentration corresponds to the molar
equivalent of Ag+ ions.

Interaction of AgNPs with
HSA
To study the interaction
of the phytochemical-coated AgNPs with HSA, concentration-dependent
studies were performed by incubating varying concentrations of the
AgNPs (0.1–240 μM) with 3 μM of HSA in sodium phosphate
buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. All solutions were brought to room temperature
for 30 min before acquiring UV–visible absorbance and fluorescence
spectra. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Jobin Yvon
HORIBA FluoroMax 4 spectrophotometer (Japan). Because tryptophan is
excited at 295 nm and produces an emission peak between 300 and 500
nm,26 fluorescence spectra were recorded
in the range of 300–500 nm by exciting the reaction mixture
at 295 nm at room temperature.

Further, to determine the binding
affinity of AgNPs to HSA using the fluorescence spectra, the dissociation
constant (Kd) was determined using eq 10 10  where Bmax refers
to the binding maxima and X and Y refer to the corresponding values from the X and Y axes.26 This equation was fitted
using GraphPad Prism 7.02, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA.

For temperature-dependent
studies, fluorescence spectra were collected
from 20 to 70 °C at intervals of 10 °C. From these data,
the binding mechanism was elucidated using Stern–Volmer plots
by plotting F0/F versus
[Q] at different temperatures.43 The binding
constant and the number of binding sites were determined using eq 11 11  where F0 and F denote the fluorescence intensities in the
absence and
the presence of the quencher (AgNPs), respectively. [Q] is the concentration
of the AgNPs, K is the binding constant, and n is the number of binding sites.3 Because the response of AgNPs at higher concentrations deviated
from linearity, only low concentrations of AgNPs were used for calculations.

CD Spectroscopy
The conformational changes to HSA on
interactions with the AgNPs were studied using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter
(USA) at room temperature (25 °C). The path length of the quartz
cell used was 0.1 cm. The protein concentration was 3 μM, and
the AgNP concentration was 240 μM. The CD spectra were collected
from 190 to 300 nm using a scan speed of 50 nm/min under a constant
nitrogen flow. Three scans were averaged to improve the signal to
noise ratio. The ellipticity values are expressed in terms of mean
residue molar ellipticity (θ) in degree cm2 dmol–1. Appropriate baseline corrections using sodium phosphate
buffer were made.
