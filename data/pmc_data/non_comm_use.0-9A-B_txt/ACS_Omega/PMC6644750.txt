Soluble aromatic polyimides and polyvinyls
were prepared by incorporating
pyridine moiety and its derivatives in the backbone and the side groups,
respectively: 6F-Py-i polymers based on the polyimide
backbone (6F-Py-1 to 6F-Py-7) and PVPy-i polymers
based on the polyvinyl backbone (PVPy-1 to PVPy-4). All polymers were
found to be amorphous. The 6F-Py-i polymers were
thermally stable up to 511–545 °C; the PVPy-i polymers were stable up to 362–376 °C. Their glass transitions,
thin film densities, molecular orbitals, and band gaps were determined.
The electrical devices fabricated with the polymers in an electrode/polymer/electrode
structure revealed p-type unipolar write-once-read-many times (namely,
permanent) or dynamic random access memory or dielectric behavior,
depending on the substituents of the pyridine unit and the film thicknesses.
In particular, such digital memory characteristics were found to originate
from the pyridine moieties possessing a high charge affinity in the
polymers. However, the pyridine moieties were found to still need
at least two or more aromatic substituents to get enough power to
stabilize charges via utilizing the resonance effects provided by
the substituents. Overall, this study demonstrated that the pyridine
unit conjugated with two or more aromatic substituents is a very useful
component to design and synthesize digital memory materials based
on thermally stable polyimides and other high performance polymers.
The 6F-Py-i polymers have potential for the low-cost
mass production of high-performance programmable unipolar permanent
memory devices with very low power consumption.

Introduction
Pyridine is an aromatic
heterocycle consisting of hydrogen, carbon,
and nitrogen atoms. Because of the electronegative nitrogen atomic
constituent, pyridine is relatively electron deficient in comparison
with benzene. Because of such deficiency, pyridine can have an improved
affinity to electrons and, indeed, be able to transport electrons.
On the other hand, pyridine owns a localized lone pair of electrons
in a sp2 orbital on the nitrogen atomic constituent, revealing
an affinity toward holes and therefore being able to transport holes.
Because of the lone paired electrons, pyridine can undergo protonation
or alkylation, opening a way to change its properties via chemical
modifications.

Therefore, research efforts have been made to
utilize such unique
beneficial characteristics of pyridine in polymer science. As a result,
several π-conjugated polymer systems bearing pyridine moiety
and its derivatives were reported, demonstrating enhanced electrical
and optical property performances.1−9 Later on, it has been attempted to incorporate pyridine moiety and
its derivatives into aromatic polyimides (PIs) to improve or solve
demerits in their properties but keep merits. PIs are well known to
exceptionally high thermal and dimensional stability and excellent
mechanical properties and have been widely used in a variety of fields,
such as microelectronics, flat-panel displays, smart phones, chemical
and environmental industries, and aerospace; but they are generally
insoluble in organic solvents and exhibit low optical transparency
and yellow color.10−16 Such demerits were solved fully or in part by the chemical addition
of pyridine moiety and its derivatives into aromatic PIs.17−19 The resulting polymers revealed improved optical and electrochemical
properties; they additionally exhibited electrochromic and protonation
properties.17−19 Nevertheless, these polymers could yet be investigated
in view of electrical memory properties.

In this study, a series
of aromatic PIs bearing pyridine moiety
and its derivatives (6F-Py-i) has been investigated
in the aspect of electrical memory characteristics: 6F-Py-1, 6F-Py-2,
6F-Py-3, 6F-Py-4, 6F-Py-5, 6F-Py-6, and 6F-Py-7 (Figure 1; Table 1), which were synthesized from the polycondensation
reactions of 4,4′-hexafluoroisopropylidenediphathalic anhydride
(6F) with 4-(4-bromophenyl)-2,6-bis(4-aminophenyl)pyridine (Py-1)
and its derivatives (Py-2, Py-3, Py-4, Py-5, Py-6 and Py-7) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. In addition, another series of
polyvinylpyridine derivatives (PVPy-i) has been prepared
as model pyridine-containing polymers by radical atomic fragmentation
transfer (RAFT) polymerizations in toluene: PVPy-1, PVPy-2, PVPy-3,
and PVPy-4 (Figure 1; Table 1). All polymers
show good solubility on a variety of organic solvents. 6F-Py-i polymer solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and PVPy-i polymer solutions in chloroform easily produce nanoscale
thin films through spin-coating and subsequent drying process. 6F-Py-i polymers in a structure of metal/polymer/metal reveal
excellent digital memory behaviors, but the memory characteristics
are varied with the substituents in the pyridine unit. PVPy-i polymers exhibit either digital memory behaviors or dielectric
behaviors depending on the substituents in the pyridine unit. Such
digital memory characteristics further show a thickness dependency
of the active polymer layer in the device; the memory behaviors could
be achieved within certain film thickness ranges. The optical and
electrochemical properties of these polymers are measured and correlated
to the electrical memory behaviors. Electrical memory mechanisms of
these polymers are investigated. Overall, we have tried to understand
origins, mechanisms, and film thickness dependencies of the digital
memory characteristics in conjunction with inductive and resonance
natures of the pyridine unit conjugated with aromatic substituents.

Results and Discussion
All polymers
of this study were examined by thermogravimetric (TG)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses in a nitrogen
atmosphere. The analysis results are summarized in Table 1. PVPy-1 shows a glass transition
temperature of 130 °C (=Tg, the onset
glass transition temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere) and 362 °C
(=Td,10, the degradation temperature showing
10 wt % mass loss in a nitrogen atmosphere). Both the Tg and Td,10 values are increased
by incorporating aromatic groups into the pyridine unit. 6F-Py-1 is
thermally stable up to around 511 °C (=Td,10). The other 6F-Py-i polymers reveal higher Td,10 values. These increases in Td,10 might be attributed to positive contributions of
the adamantanyl and aromatic substituents replaced to the bromo group
in the pyridine-based diamine monomer unit in the polymer. 6F-Py-2
shows Tg = 205 °C. The Tg value is increased as the adamantanyl group is replaced
by bulky, aromatic groups. On the basis of these Tg data, 6F-Py-1 owning only the bromo group in the diamine
monomer unit is expected to reveal a Tg value lower than that of 6F-Py-2. However, Tg could not be detected in the DSC run of 6F-Py-1. This result
may be attributed to very small changes in the heat of fusion through
the glass transition. Overall, the 6F-Py-i polymer
family (which are based on the aromatic PI backbone) exhibits relatively
higher Tg and Td,10 values than those of the PVPy-i polymer family
based on aliphatic polyvinyl backbone.

All 6F-Py-i and PVPy-i polymers
are soluble in organic solvents, producing good quality films (ca.
0.7 nm or less root-mean square surface roughness) via conventional
solution casting and subsequent drying process. Together with the
inherent viscosity data (Table 1), these film formation results support that all polymers
were synthesized with reasonably high molecular weights.

All
polymers in thin films were subjected to synchrotron grazing
incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) analysis. Representatives of the
measured GIXS images are presented in Figures 2a,b and S1–S3. All polymers in films show only amorphous halos, which are attributed
to the chain-to-chain, chain-to-side group, and side group-to-side
group distances; the halo peak in the low angle region originates
from the mean chain-to-chain distance, whereas that in the high angle
region comes from the mean side group-to-side group distance. The d-spacing values for the amorphous halo peaks are listed
in Table 1. These scattering
images collectively indicate that all polymers produced amorphous
films through the conventional solution casting and subsequent drying
processes. Here, it is additionally noted that all PVPy-i films apparently reveal isotropic halos, indicating a random orientation
of the polymer chains in the films. However, all 6F-Py-i films apparently show anisotropic halos whose intensities are stronger
in the out-of-plane direction of the films than in the in-plane direction
of the films. These anisotropic halos indicate that in the films the
polymer chains were preferentially laid in the film plane rather than
randomly. These in-plane orientation tendencies in the 6F-Py-i films might be attributed to the relatively high chain
rigidities based on the aromatic PI backbone. In comparison, the random
chain orientations in the PVPy-i films might result
from the relatively high chain flexibilities based on the aliphatic
hydrocarbon backbone.

profiles

(a) GIXS image and (c) XR profile of PVPy-1 film (32.93 nm thick);
(b) GIXS image and (d) XR profile of 6F-Py-1 film (30.25 nm thick).
In each XR profile, the symbols are the measured data and the solid
line represents the fit curve. An X-ray source of λ = 0.1230
nm (wavelength) was used for the GIXS measurements; an X-ray source
of λ = 0.1240 nm was used for the XR measurements.

The polymer films were further subjected to synchrotron
X-ray reflectivity
(XR) analysis. As shown in Figures 2c,d and S4, the measured
XR data could be satisfactorily fitted by using the Parratt algorithm,20,21 giving the electron densities (ρe) of the polymer
films. From the ρe values and chemical structures
of polymers, the mass densities (ρm) have been calculated.
The ρe value ranges in 283.61–301.35 electrons/nm3 for the PVPy-i films and 331.06–429.43
electrons/nm3 for the 6F-Py-i films; the
ρm value is 0.895–0.947 g/cm3 for
the PVPy-i films and 1.073–1.385 g/cm3 for the PVPy-i films (Table 1). The PVPy-i films reveal
relatively lower ρe and ρm values,
compared to those of the 6F-Py-i films. Interestingly,
the PVPy-4 film exhibits the lowest ρe and ρm values, whereas the 6F-Py-2 film reveals the highest ρe and ρm values.

Figure 3 shows representatives
of the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy and
cyclic voltammetry (CV) data measured for PVPy-1 and 6F-Py-1; the
data of the other polymers are given in Figures S5–S8. From the UV–vis spectra, bandgaps (Ebg), which are the differences between the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, could be determined. From
the CV data, the oxidation half-wave potentials (E1/2) versus Ag/AgCl could be determined. The E1/2 for the external ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) system was measured
to be 0.57 V versus Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile. Assuming that the HOMO
level for the Fc/Fc+ standard is −4.80 eV with respect to the zero vacuum
level, the HOMO levels (EHOMO) of polymers
could be calculated. The LUMO levels (ELUMO) of polymers could be estimated from the HOMO levels and optical
band gaps. Moreover, the energy barriers of HOMO and LUMO levels to
the Al and boron-doped silicon electrodes could be estimated. The
analysis results are summarized in Table 2. Depending on the substituents in the pyridine
unit, the EHOMO of PVPy-i varies in the range of −4.87 to −5.07 eV and the ELUMO ranges in −0.55 to −1.32
eV. In comparison, 6F-Py-i reveals EHOMO = −5.34 to −5.53 eV and ELUMO = −2.08 to −2.33 eV, depending on the
substituents in the pyridine unit. Overall, the PVPy-i polymers exhibit relatively higher EHOMO, ELUMO, and Ebg levels, compared to those of the 6F-Py-i polymers.
The results collectively confirm that for both PVPy-i and 6F-Py-i polymers, higher number of aromatic
substituents (i.e., larger resonance effect) in the pyridine unit
leads to lower EHOMO, ELUMO, and Ebg levels. The
results further indicate that such EHOMO, ELUMO, and Ebg levels are governed by the pyridine unit and its substituents in
the polymers.

acetonitrile using a platinum gauze counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl
(saturated KCl) reference electrode; the polymers were coated on the
gold (Au) electrode deposited on a silicon wafer. A scan rate of 100
mV/s was used.

The devices
fabricated with polymers in a simple structure of the
electrode/polymer film/electrode were examined electrically (Figures 4a and 5a). Surprisingly, the PVPy-1 polymer in the devices reveals
no electrical memory characteristics at all even though possessing
one pyridine moiety per repeat unit, as shown in Figure 4b–d. More surprisingly,
PVPy-2 exhibits no electrical memory characteristics either even though
possessing one additional phenyl group as a substituent to the pyridine
moiety in repeat (Figure 4e–g). These results indicate that both PVPy-1 and PVPy-2
are electrically dielectric, rather than electrically active.

(20.19 nm thick). The electrode contact area was 300 × 300 μm2.

In contrast, PVPy-3, which has
two phenyl substituents in the pyridine
moiety, demonstrates an electrically switching-ON behavior, as shown
in Figure 4h. The PVPy-3
film (11.46 nm thick) in the device initially exhibits a high resistance
(OFF-state) as observed for PVPy-1 and PVPy-2. But, the PVPy-3 film
shows an abrupt increase in the current around 4 V (=Vc,ON, critical voltage to switch on the device, which
corresponds to the function as a “writing” or “saving”
process in memory device) when a positive voltage applied with a compliance
current of 0.01 A. After reaching an electrically ON-state, the polymer
retains the ON-state during further sweeping with higher voltages.
The ON-state is well retained during the reverse voltage sweep, even
after the power is turned off, and even during the negative voltage
sweep. The ON/OFF current ratio is estimated to be 103 to
105, depending on the reading voltage chosen. A similar
electrical switching behavior is observed even during negative voltage
sweepings (Figure S9a). Overall, the PVPy-3
film (11.46 nm thick) demonstrates excellent unipolar write-once-read-many-times
(WORM) memory behavior. Similar unipolar WORM memory behaviors are
demonstrated with the 18.52 nm thick polymer films (Figures 4i and S9b). However, the 28.61 nm thick PVPy-3 films reveal a somewhat
different memory behavior. The films are initially in the OFF-state
and switches on at the voltage range of 2.5–4.0 V during a
positive voltage sweep (Figure 4j); the switching-ON occurs at 4.5–5.0 V in a negative
voltage sweep (Figure S9c). Such ON-states
are maintained well under the power supplied continuously. When the
power is turned off, the polymer film is, however, returned to the
OFF-state. The ON/OFF current ratio is estimated to be 103 to 105, depending on the reading voltages. These results
confirm that the 28.61 nm thick PVPy-3 film demonstrates excellent
unipolar dynamic-random-access-memory (DRAM) characteristics, rather
than WORM memory characteristics. Interestingly, PVPy-3 does not show
any electrical memory behaviors when the film thickness is 40 nm or
thicker (Figure 4k).
Collectively, PVPy-3 reveals unipolar WORM memory, DRAM, or dielectric
behaviors depending on the film thicknesses (Table 3).

d Unipolar DRAM behavior.

Similar electrical behaviors are observed for PVPy-4
possessing
three phenyl substituents in the pyridine moiety, as presented in Figures 4l–o and S9d–f. However, PVPy-4 demonstrates only
unipolar WORM memory characteristics over the film thickness range
10–30 nm; no DRAM behaviors could be demonstrated (Table 3). The ON/OFF current
ratio ranges in 103 to 106, depending on the
reading voltages. These ON/OFF current ratios are relatively larger
than those of PVPy-3. PVPy-4 also has dielectric characteristics in
films of ≥40 nm.

Like PVPy-4, all 6F-Py-i polymers demonstrate
only unipolar WORM memory characteristics. In case of the 20 nm thick
film devices, Vc,ON = 3–4 V depending
on the substituents in the pyridine unit; the ON/OFF current ratio
is in the range 103 to 106, depending on the
substituents in the pyridine unit and the reading voltages (Figure 5). Such ON-state
could not be turned off by voltage sweeps with the compliance current
of 0.1 A which is 10 times higher than that used in the first voltage
sweep (Figure S10); similar behaviors are
observed for the PVPy-3 and PVPy-4 devices showing WORM memory characteristics.
Such unipolar WORM memory behavior is demonstrated over a certain
film thickness window of 10 to 20 or 40 or 50 nm, depending on the
substituents in the pyridine unit (Figure S11; Table 3). Overall,
the Vc,ON of the WORM memory device tends
to increase as the polymer film thickness is increased.

The
devices, which reveal WORM or DRAM memory characteristics,
were subjected to the reliability test. For the PVPy-3 (28.61 nm thick)
device revealing DRAM behavior, the OFF-state and the ON-state is
well retained in a duration of 40 000 s even in air ambient
conditions at room temperature, as shown in Figure 6a. Similar high device stabilities are confirmed
for the other memory devices exhibiting WORM memory behaviors (Figures 6b–d and S12).

Al/PVPy-i/Al and boron-doped Si/6F-Py-i/Al devices in the

of 0.01 A in air ambient conditions: (a) PVPy-3 (28.61 nm thick; 100
× 100 μm2 cell size) where the reading voltage
was 5.0 V for the ON-state and 1.0 V for the OFF-state; (b) PVPy-4
(29.93 nm thick; 100 × 100 μm2 cell size) where
the reading voltage was 1.0 V for the ON- and OFF-states; (c) 6F-Py-1
(21.76 nm thick; 300 × 300 μm2 cell size) where
the reading voltage was 1.0 V for the ON- and OFF-states; (d) 6F-Py-3
(19.98 nm thick; 300 × 300 μm2 cell size) where
the reading voltage was 1.0 V for the ON- and OFF-states.

The electrical memory characteristics, which were
described above,
can be understood by considering all relating factors as follows.

First, a question arises: what electrical mechanisms are behind
the digital memory behaviors of polymer devices? To get any information
on mechanisms, the current–voltage (I–V) data of devices were analyzed by using various conduction
approaches.22−26 The analysis found that, regardless of the substituents in the pyridine
unit, the OFF-state generally follows an Ohmic conduction in the low
voltage region initially and then suddenly turns to follow a trap-limited
space charge limited conduction (SCLC), whereas the ON-state always
follows an Ohmic conduction once the device is turned on (Figures 7; S13 and S14). Moreover, the electrical memory devices were
found to reveal a similar ON-current level over the range 100 ×
100 to 1000 × 1000 μm2, regardless of the substituents
in the pyridine unit (Figure S15). These
results suggest that the electrical switching-ON behaviors occur locally
throughout the active polymer layer in the device.

Figure 7 I–V data analysis of the
devices in the OFF- and ON-states, which were measured with a compliance
current of 0.01 A in air ambient conditions; the Al/PVPy-4 (29.93
nm thick)/Al device with 100 × 100 μm2 cells:
(a) OFF-state and (b) ON-state; boron-doped Si/6F-Py-1 (21.76 nm thick)/Al
device with 300 × 300 μm2 cells: (c) OFF-state
and (d) ON-state. The symbols are the measured data; the solid red
lines in (a,c) represent the fit lines using Ohmic conduction and
trap-limited SCLC models, whereas the red lines in (b,d) represent
the fit lines using the Ohmic conduction model.

Second, the energy barriers for hole injection into the HOMO
level
from the electrodes are always much lower than those for electron
injection into the LUMO level from electrodes, regardless of the substituents
in the pyridine unit (Table 2). These results indicate that the observed WORM memory and
DRAM behaviors are mainly governed by hole injections rather than
electron injections.

Third, PVPy-1 bearing only one pyridine
unit per side group, and
PVPy-2 containing a pyridine unit conjugated with one aromatic ring
per side group shows only dielectric characteristics. PVPy-3 bearing
a pyridine unit conjugated with two aromatic rings per side group
exhibits three different electrical characteristics, depending on
the film thicknesses: the 10–20 Woollam spectroscopic nm thick
films exhibit p-type unipolar WORM memory behaviors, whereas the 30
nm thick films show p-type unipolar DRAM behavior; the 40 nm thick
films are dielectric. PVPy-4 containing a pyridine unit conjugated
with three aromatic rings per side group exhibits p-type WORM memory
behaviors for the film thickness range 10–30 nm but dielectric
characteristics for the 40 nm thick films. These results collectively
give a clue that the p-type digital memory behaviors of PVPy-3 and
PVPy-4 have originated from a positive cooperation of the high charge
(i.e., hole) affinity of the pyridine unit and the stabilization of
charges trapped on the pyridine unit by the conjugated two or three
aromatic substituents. A higher resonance effect of aromatic substituents
onto the pyridine unit could lead to more stable digital memory, namely
WORM memory. A moderate resonance effect of such aromatic substituents
(e.g., only two aromatic rings) could provide WORM memory for thinner
film devices (10–20 nm thick film devices) but give DRAM for
the 30 nm thick film devices. Here, it is noted that DRAM is relatively
less stable than WORM memory in the view of data storage. A lower
resonance effect of such aromatic substituents (e.g., only one aromatic
ring or none) could cause only dielectric behavior. Overall, the pyridine
unit in the polymer requires at least two aromatic substituents or
more to create a resonance effect for digital memory characteristics.

Fourth, all 6F-Py-i polymers bearing a pyridine
unit conjugated with three or more aromatic substituents per repeat
unit exhibit only p-type unipolar WORM memory behaviors. These results
again confirm that such WORM memory characteristics are attributed
to a positive cooperation of the pyridine units of high charge affinity
and the aromatic substituents of the resonance effect.

Fifth,
the pyridine units conjugated with aromatic substituents
are geometrically localized as parts (a part of the repeat unit or
a part of the side group) of the nonconjugated polymer backbone. Their
mean interdistance is in the range 0.38–0.77 nm (Table 1). Moreover, all polymer films
are amorphous. Considering these morphology characteristics, in the
memory devices the trap-limited SCLC combined with Ohmic conduction
in the OFF-state and the Ohmic conduction in the ON-state could be
governed by a hopping process of charges during applying electric
field via using such pyridine units conjugated with aromatic substituents
locally distributed through the active polymer film layer as stepping
stones.

Lastly, the digital memory characteristics of a given
polymer are
observed within a certain film thickness range. The film thickness
dependencies might be attributed to charge traps and transportations
via hopping process nature by utilizing the conjugated pyridine units
and aromatic substituents locally positioned in the active polymer
film layer as charge trap sites and stepping stones.

Conclusions
Two different series of non-π-conjugated polymers bearing
the pyridine unit and its aromatic substituents in the backbone or
in the side group have been prepared: PVPy-i polymers
based on the polyvinyl backbone and 6F-Py-i polymers
based on the PI backbone. They have been investigated in nanoscale
thin films from the aspects of morphological structure and properties
including electrical memory characteristics.

The synchrotron
GIXS analysis found that all polymers in thin films
are amorphous; in the DSC analysis, Tg is observed over 130–225 °C for the PVPy-i polymers and 205–264 °C for the 6F-Py-i polymers depending on the substituents of the pyridine unit. The
XR analysis together with the chemical structures provided electron
and mass densities for the polymers: depending on the substituents
of the pyridine unit, ρe is 283.61–301.35
electrons/nm3 (ρm = 0.895–0.947
g/cm3) for PVPy-i films and 329.85–429.43
electrons/nm3 (ρm = 1.073–1.385
g/cm3) for 6F-Py-i films. The PVPy-i polymers are thermally stable up to 362–376 °C;
the 6F-Py-i polymers are stable up to 511–545
°C. In addition, their molecular orbitals and band gaps have
been determined.

The device fabrication and electrical analysis
found that the pyridine
units conjugated with at least two aromatic substituents are essential
to demonstrate p-type unipolar digital memory characteristics for
PVPy-i and 6F-Py-i polymers in certain
film thickness ranges of less than 50 nm. PVPy-3 and PVPy-4, and all
6F-Py-i polymers show permanent memory behaviors;
DRAM is observed for only PVPy-3 films of 30 nm thick. The film thickness
dependencies could be attributed to charge traps and the hopping process
via the utilization of pyridine units conjugated with aromatic substituents
throughout the active polymer film. The digital memory characteristics
could be governed by a trap-limited SCLC combined with Ohmic conduction.
The polymer devices are highly stable and reliable.

In conclusion,
this study has demonstrated that the pyridine unit
conjugated with two or more aromatic substituents is a very powerful
component to design and synthesize digital memory materials based
on thermally stable PIs and other high performance polymers. In particular,
the 6F-Py-i polymers have potential for the low-cost
mass production of high-performance programmable unipolar WORM memory
devices with very low power consumption.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Aromatic PIs bearing pyridine moiety and
its derivatives (6F-Py-i: 6F-Py-1, 6F-Py-2, 6F-Py-3,
6F-Py-4, 6F-Py-5, 6F-Py-6, and 6F-Py-7 in Figure 1) were prepared, according to the synthetic
methods reported in the literature.17−19 Aliphatic polyvinyls
bearing pyridine moiety and its derivatives (PVPy-i: PVPy-1, PVPy-2, PVPy-3, and PVPy-4 in Figure 1) were newly synthesized by the RAFT polymerization
reactions of vinyl monomers containing the pyridine unit and its derivatives;
the synthetic details are given in the Supporting Information. The material details are summarized in Table 1. The individual 6F-Py-i polymers were dissolved in DMSO, producing homogeneous
polymer solutions with 1.0 wt % concentration. PVPy-i polymer solutions were also prepared with a concentration of 1.0
wt % in chloroform. The obtained polymer solutions were filtered through
polytetrafluoroethylene membrane microfilters with a pore size of
0.22 μm before use.

Thermal Analysis
Thermal properties
were determined
with a ramping rate of 10.0 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere
by TGA and DSC analysis. TGA measurements were carried out using a
Seiko Instruments (model SII TG/DTA 6200, Tokyo, Japan) and a TA Instruments
(model Dynamic TGA 2950, New Castle, DE, USA). DSC measurements were
conducted using a Seiko calorimeter (model SII DSC 6220) and a TA
calorimeter (model DSC TA 910).

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
and CV
The polymer solutions
were cast on quartz substrates and then dried in vacuum at 100 °C
for 24 h. For the obtained polymer films, UV–vis spectroscopy
measurements were carried out using a Scinco spectrometer (model S-3100,
Scinco Co., Seoul, Korea). CV measurements were conducted at 20 °C
in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile using
an electrochemical workstation (IM6ex impedance analyzer, ZAHNER-Elektrik,
Kronach, Germany) with a platinum gauze counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl
(saturated KCl) reference electrode, and the polymers were coated
on the gold electrode deposited on the silicon wafer. A scan rate
of 100 mV/s was used.

Synchrotron XR and GIXS
By using
these polymer solutions,
nanoscale thin films were prepared on silicon substrates by spin-coating
and subsequently drying in vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h. The thicknesses
of the obtained polymer films were measured by using a spectroscopic
ellipsometer (model M2000, Woollam, Lincoln, NE, USA). XR measurements
were carried at the three-dimensional beamline of the Pohang Accelerator
Laboratory (PAL). Film samples were mounted on a Huber four-circle
goniometer equipped with a scintillation counter with an enhanced
dynamic range (model EDR, Bede Scientific, Centennial, CO, USA) as
a detector. The X-ray beam with a wavelength λ of 0.1240 nm
was collimated at the sample position to 2.0 mm (horizontal) by 0.1
mm (vertical). Specular reflection was measured in the θ–2θ
scanning mode. All measurements were conducted at room temperature.
The measured reflected intensity was normalized to the intensity of
the primary beam, which was monitored with an ionization chamber.

GIXS measurements were conducted at the 3C and 9A beamlines of PAL.
The film samples at room temperature were measured at a sample-to-detector
distance of 210.54–222.19 mm. Scattering data were typically
collected for 10–60 s using an X-ray radiation source of λ
= 0.1230 nm (3C beamline) or 0.1110 nm (9A beamline) with a two-dimensional
(2D) charge-coupled detector (model Rayonix 2D Mar, Evanston, IL,
USA). The incidence angle αi of
each X-ray beam was set in the range 0.127–0.172°, which
is between the critical angles of the polymer films and the silicon
substrate (αc,f and αc,s). Scattering
angles were corrected according to the positions of the X-ray beams
with respect to a precalibrated sucrose and silver behenate (TCI,
Tokyo, Japan) powder. Aluminum foil pieces were applied as a semitransparent
beam stop, because the intensity of the specular reflection from the
substrate is much stronger than the intensity of GIXS near the critical
angle.

Memory Device Fabrication and Measurement
Memory devices
in a simple electrode/polymer/electrode structure were fabricated
in two ways as follows. The first case of devices was fabricated with
the 6F-Py-i polymers using highly boron-doped silicon
substrates as a bottom electrode. Polymer films were prepared on the
boron-doped silicon substrates by spin-coating with varying spin speed
and time and then drying in vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h. The thicknesses
of the obtained polymer films were measured by using a Woollam spectroscopic
ellipsometer (model M2000). Thereafter, Al top electrodes were deposited
with a thickness of 100 nm onto the polymer films through a shadow
mask by thermal evaporation under a pressure of 10–6 Torr. The range of the obtained cell size was 100 × 100, 200
× 200, 300 × 300, 500 × 500, and 1000 × 1000 μm2. The second case of devices was fabricated with the PVPy-i polymers using silicon substrates with a thermally grown
oxide layer. Aluminum (Al) strips (300 nm thick) with a width of 100
and 200 μm were deposited as bottom electrodes onto the silicon
substrates through a shadow mask by electron-beam sputtering. Each
PVPy-i polymer solution was spin-coated onto the
Al bottom electrodes and dried in vacuum at room temperature for 24
h. Thicknesses of the obtained films were measured by spectroscopic
ellipsometry. Then, Al strips (300 nm thick) were deposited as top
electrodes with a width of 100 and 200 μm onto the polymer film
layers through a shadow masks by thermal evaporation under vacuum.
Current–voltage (I–V) measurements were carried out using a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor
(model 4200-SCS, Cleveland, OH, USA). All electrical experiments were
conducted at room temperature under ambient condition.
