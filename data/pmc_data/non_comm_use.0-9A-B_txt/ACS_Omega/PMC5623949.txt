Pteridine reductase-1 (PTR1) is a promising
drug target for the treatment of trypanosomiasis. We investigated
the potential of a previously identified class of thiadiazole inhibitors
of Leishmania major PTR1 for activity
against Trypanosoma brucei (Tb). We solved crystal structures of several TbPTR1-inhibitor complexes to guide the structure-based design of new
thiadiazole derivatives. Subsequent synthesis and enzyme- and cell-based
assays confirm new, mid-micromolar inhibitors of TbPTR1 with low toxicity. In particular, compound 4m,
a biphenyl-thiadiazole-2,5-diamine with IC50 = 16 μM,
was able to potentiate the antitrypanosomal activity of the dihydrofolate
reductase inhibitor methotrexate (MTX) with a 4.1-fold decrease of
the EC50 value. In addition, the antiparasitic activity
of the combination of 4m and MTX was reversed by addition
of folic acid. By adopting an efficient hit discovery platform, we
demonstrate, using the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole scaffold, how a promising
tool for the development of anti-T. brucei agents can be obtained.

Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), neglected tropical
diseases afflict over 1 billion people.1 Among them, parasitic infections caused by trypanosomatids represent
a major challenge. Kinetoplastea is a class of flagellated parasitic
protists, which includes various human pathogens transmitted by insect
vectors. Diseases that result from kinetoplastid infections include
human African trypanosomiasis (HAT; also known as African sleeping
sickness), which is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense, Chagas
disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and various forms of leishmaniasis caused due to infection with
different species of Leishmania.2 Sleeping sickness is found across sub-Saharan
Africa and evolves in two phases. The parasite first reaches the bloodstream
and the lymphatic system, where it multiplies. At a later stage, the
parasite crosses the blood–brain barrier, reaching the central
nervous system and leading to death if untreated.3 Therefore, therapies should be able to cure at least one
of the two stages or both. Pentamidine and suramin are first choice
drugs for the treatment of HAT. These drugs are specific for the first
stage of pathology but they are completely ineffective in the second
neuronal stage. Eflornithine, either in monotherapy or in combination
with nifurtimox, is approved for second-stage treatment of HAT caused
by T. b. gambiense.4 For the latter stage, melarsoprol is also still used despite
its high toxicity.5 However, all of the
drugs mentioned above have problems relating to poor efficacy, difficulties
in administration, and side effects. In addition, drug resistance
is also emerging. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover new improved
and affordable drugs.3 A target-based drug-discovery
approach is a promising strategy for the discovery of new treatments
for neglected diseases6 and has been successfully
exploited for the development of eflornithine (an inhibitor of ornithine
decarboxylase).7 Other targets, such as N-myristoyltransferase,8 farnesyl
transferase,9 trypanothione reductase,10 and cathepsin L,11 have been validated in T. brucei (Tb), but no drugs acting on these targets have yet been approved for
the treatment of HAT. One approach, successfully used in the treatment
of some bacterial infections12 and malaria,13 could entail the use of drugs that target enzymes
involved in folate metabolism. Targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)
alone does not allow for successful antitrypanosomatid therapy because
of the presence of pteridine reductase-1 (PTR1). PTR1 is a reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent short-chain
dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) mainly involved in the reduction of
conjugated and unconjugated pterins, such as biopterin.14,15 PTR1 is responsible for the production of 10% of tetrahydrofolate
required by the cell, and its expression is increased when parasite
DHFR is inhibited by antifolate drugs. PTR1 thus provides the reduced
folate necessary for parasite survival, thereby contributing to treatment
failure.16,17 PTR1 knockdown studies performed by RNA
interference methodologies on blood stream form T.
brucei compromised parasitic growth in vitro and in
an animal host.17,18 This evidence supports the importance
of PTR1 for parasitic survival and indicates that it is a promising
drug target for the treatment of HAT. However, TbPTR1 inhibitors developed to date have limited antiparasitic activity
against T. brucei.6,15,19−23 In our previous work, we have identified thiadiazole derivatives
as a new class of Leishmania major PTR1
(LmPTR1) inhibitors that showed synergistic activity
in combination with pyrimethamine (a DHFR inhibitor) against both L. major and Leishmania mexicana promastigotes.24,25 The same behavior was observed
with another PTR1 inhibitor class, namely pteridines, tested against
the same Leishmania species. Thus,
the emerging concept was that the selective PTR1 inhibitor alone did
not show antiparasitic activity, and only the combination with a DHFR
inhibitor, such as pyrimethamine, allowed the antiparasitic activity
detection.26 In the present work, we sought
to exploit the thiadiazole scaffold as a source of new inhibitors
of TbPTR1, thereby targeting the folate/biopterin
pathway with potential for activity against the parasite in combination
with DHFR inhibitors. Therefore, we focused mainly on compounds that
showed PTR1 inhibition and no/low antiparasitic activity to exploit
the above combination concept.

We have established an efficient
hit discovery platform, which has a sound foundation in drug discovery
that made use of a combination of computational design, organic synthesis,
X-ray crystallography, enzyme inhibition, and antiparasitic activity
assays as well as early-toxicity studies. The chemical starting points
of the present study originated from a screen of the previously tested
thiadiazole library24 against TbPTR1 and the T. brucei parasite. We
then determined five ternary crystal structures of TbPTR1 in complex with the cofactor NADP+ and thiadiazole
compounds, providing crucial data to support the design of improved
inhibitors. Four new compound series, including a total of 57 compounds
based on the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole scaffold, were designed, synthesized,
and evaluated against TbPTR1. In addition, structure–activity
relationships (SAR) for TbPTR1 were derived from
comparison of computational docking results and crystallographic analyses.
Initial toxicity assessments were carried out with a panel of five
assays in high throughput screening (HTS) format. All compounds were
evaluated for in vitro antiparasitic activity by phenotypic HTS against T. brucei. Finally, the most potent TbPTR1 inhibitors were assayed in combination with the known DHFR inhibitor
methotrexate (MTX) to evaluate the efficacy of the simultaneous inhibition
of DHFR and PTR1 on T. brucei parasite
growth.

Results and Discussion
Selection of Compounds I–IV and
X-ray Crystallographic Analyses
Compounds I–X (Table S1) of the original thiadiazole
library were selected for testing against TbPTR1,
based on molecular diversity and compound availability.24,27 Only compounds II–IV showed measurable inhibition
constants (Ki) against TbPTR1 in the range of 48–88 μM (IIKi 48 μM; IIIKi 53 μM; and IVKi 88 μM), thus behaving as weak TbPTR1
inhibitors (Figure 1 and Table S1). Compound I showed an EC50 value of 35 μM in the T. brucei parasite growth inhibition assay and no
detectable inhibition of TbPTR1 at 100 μM.
We could not detect antiparasitic activity for compounds II and III at concentrations up to 50 μM. Compound IV was the only compound with low PTR1 inhibition and parasite
growth inhibition (TbPTR1 Ki 88 μM and T. brucei EC50 170 μM). Compounds V–X showed
low inhibition of TbPTR1 (Table S1) at the tested concentration and no detectable growth inhibition
of the T. brucei parasite at the concentration
tested (50 or 100 μM). Compounds I–IV showed
high toxicity against mammalian cells with selectivity indices (EC50 mammalian/EC50T. brucei) lower than 1 (Table S1).

Figure 1 Chemical structures of previously synthesized thiadiazoles (I–IV) crystallized with TbPTR1–NADP+ and the newly designed thiadiazoles (series 1–4).

We carried
out crystallographic analyses of TbPTR1-inhibitor
complexes to identify possible templates for medicinal chemistry exploration.
Previous docking studies19 indicated that
the thiadiazole ring would form a stacking interaction between the
nicotinamide ring of NADP+ and Phe113 of LmPTR1 (corresponding to Phe97 of TbPTR1) and that
lack of a cofactor results in a disordered binding pocket.28I–X were used for crystallization
trials with TbPTR1, and for four compounds I–IV (Figure 1) ternary
complex structures [PDB ID: 2YHI (I); 2YHU (II); 4WCF (III); and 4WCD (IV)] were determined at high resolution (1.80, 2.01,
1.68, and 1.93 Å, respectively). Crystallographic statistics
are presented in Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

The crystal structures are isomorphous with an asymmetric
unit consisting of a homotetramer, the functional unit of TbPTR1. Each subunit has the typical structure of the short-chain
SDR superfamily: a single α/β-domain constructed from
a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet sandwiched between two sets
of α-helices. The active site is an L-shaped depression, formed
primarily by one subunit and blocked at one end by a partner subunit.
NADP+ binds in an extended conformation to form the binary
complex essential for substrate/ligand binding. Analyses of the complexes
with I–IV shows that the interaction of compounds I–III is mainly driven by the thiadiazole moiety, which
is indeed sandwiched between the nicotinamide of NADP+ and
Phe97 (Figure 2A–C).
However, for compound IV (Figure 2D), it is the bulkier benzotriazole substituent
that stacks in this position, placing the thiadiazole moiety to participate
in an edge–face interaction with Trp221 on the periphery of
the active site. The crystal structure of TbPTR1–NADP+–I shows that the chloro-ethyl moiety
of the inhibitor establishes a halogen bond with the π-system
of Trp221 and van der Waals interactions with Val206, Pro210, and
Met213. The amino group is H-bonded to Tyr174 OH and to the nicotinamide
ribose, whereas a water molecule mediates the interactions with the
side chain of Ser95 and the cofactor phosphate (Figure 2A). Because of the increased bulk of II and III, these compounds are placed further
toward the cofactor, and the amino group displaces the ordered water
observed in the TbPTR1–NADP+–I active site (Figure 2B,C). A H-bond is formed between Tyr174 and nitrogen at position
3 of the thiadiazole ring of compound II (not shown).
The same nitrogen is within the H-bonding distance of the ribose moiety
of the cofactor. This interaction is also visible in the complex with
compound III (Figure 2C). Moreover, here the amino group on the aminopyridine
ring is H-bonded to Asp161 and Tyr174 and participates in water-mediated
interactions with the same aspartate and the carbonyl of Gly205 (not
shown). Comparison between the binding modes of compounds II–III and folate (PDB: 3BMC; TbPTR1–NADP+–folate complex)
reveals that thiadiazole overlaps 2-amino-4-oxo pyrimidine of folic
acid (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information). Notably, the amino group at position 2 of compounds II and III superimposes on the amino group in position
2 of the pteridine, forming similar H-bonds with the enzyme and the
cofactor. In the case of II, the thiophene ring forms
a T-shaped stacking interaction with Trp221 (Figure 2B). In the structure of the ternary complex TbPTR1–NADP+–IV (Figure 2D), although similar
to the other inhibitor complexes, one active site of the tetramer
does not possess electron density for either the cofactor or the inhibitor.
Moreover, in this subunit, the loop adjacent to the active site, including
residues from 209 to 217, is disordered and hence excluded from our
model. In addition to the different stacking arrangement described
for compound IV, a series of polar interactions stabilize
the benzotriazole position. The nitrogen at position 1 forms a H-bond
with NADP+ phosphate, and cofactor ribose hydroxyl is within
the hydrogen bonding distance of the benzotriazole nitrogens at positions
2 and 3 that are further involved in weak interactions with the hydroxyl
groups of Ser95 and Tyr174, respectively.

Despite the modest
biological profile of compounds I–IV as TbPTR1 inhibitors, we sought to explore the potential of this class of compounds
as TbPTR1 inhibitors and anti-T. brucei agents, guided by the structural binding mode of the thiadiazole
scaffold within TbPTR1 observed in the four resolved
crystallographic complexes. The design of new thiadiazole derivatives
focused on the optimization of the molecular interactions described
herein, exploiting the most reliable binding mode of compounds I–III. In our design, we aimed at identifying a TbPTR1 inhibitor that can show a synergistic effect in combination
with a DHFR inhibitor; therefore, the antiparasitic activity of the
thiadiazole derivative per se was not considered to be a requirement
for the synergistic combination effect.

Design of 2-Amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole Derivatives
To initiate
the design of new 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives, molecular
interaction fields were calculated (SiteMap27) to understand how the ligands complement the receptor and how extensions
into adjacent regions could promote binding. The structures of TbPTR1 with compounds I–IV show similar
interaction fields in the active site. However, we opted to exploit
for the development of the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole core, the binding
mode of compounds I–III, as it is conserved in
three of the four X-ray crystal structures, thus providing a reliable
premise for the structure-based inhibitor design. These structures
reveal a large hydrophobic region between Phe97 and the nicotinamide,
extending toward the surface of the protein next to Trp221, which
closes the TbPTR1 active site (Figure 3). Two distinct hydrophilic regions were
also identified, which can be further divided into regions favorable
for H-bond donors and acceptors. One of these is located in the depth
of the catalytic site, and the phosphate groups of the NADP+ cofactor, Ser95 and Tyr174, delineate it. This region is split into
a region favorable for H-bond donors, which is in part addressed by
the amino group in position 2 on the main core scaffold, and a small
favorable interaction site for H-bond acceptors. The second hydrophilic
region is close to Asp161 and represents an additional favorable interaction
site for H-bond donors. Therefore, extending from the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole
core, which establishes key interactions, we modified position 5 of
the ring with substituents designed to interact with the residues
lining the pocket of the binding site. Four series of compounds were
synthesized (Figure 1). In the first two series, a phenyl or heteroaromatic ring (compounds 1a–t, Chart 1) or a biphenyl system (compounds 2a–g, Chart 2) was bound
to the thiadiazole ring to fill the large hydrophobic region located
next to the catalytic site. In the third series (compounds 3a–k, Chart 3), the aromatic
ring was spaced with a short aliphatic chain (one to three carbon
atoms) to reach the position occupied by the p-amino-benzoic
acid (PABA) ring of the natural folic acid substrate. The only exception
is compound 3i, which has the distal aromatic ring replaced
by dimethylamine; it was commercially available and was purchased.
Compound II (showing the lowest Ki value in the initial screen) was resynthesized as an internal
reference (3k). Then, to closely match the nitrogen system
of the pteridine moiety of the natural PTR1 substrate and to potentially
address the additional region favorable for H-bond donors close to
Asp161, a fourth series of thiadiazoles was designed (compounds 4a–s, Chart 4), introducing nitrogen in position 5 of the thiadiazole ring.

Chemistry
Four series of thiadiazoles
were synthesized: 5-aryl-2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (1a–t); 5-biphenyl-2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (2a–g); 5-alkyl-2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (3a–k),
and 2,5-diamino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (4a–s). For
the synthesis of compounds 1a–t, 2a–g, and 3a–k, the closure of the thiadiazole ring
was optimized and four synthetic pathways were developed (Scheme 1). The choice of
the synthetic method was constrained by the compatibility between
the sensitive chemical functions present in the molecule and the strong
oxidizing and dehydrating agents necessary for the thiadiazole ring
closure. Method A, depicted in Scheme 1, requires the condensation of the appropriate alkyl/aryl
carboxylic acid with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of phosphorus-(V)-oxachloride
(POCl3).29 Compounds 1i, 1j–k, 1o, 2b, 3a, 3c–d, and 3f–g were synthesized following the described procedure. It was not possible
to obtain the thiadiazoles 1a, 3e, 3h, and 3j–k in the presence of POCl3; for these compounds, the use of concentrated sulfuric acid
as a dehydrating agent at room temperature overnight allowed the final
compounds to be obtained in good yield (method B, Scheme 1).29 The synthesis of thiadiazoles 1b, 1t, 3b, and intermediate 6 required milder experimental
conditions because several attempts with sulfuric acid or POCl3 led to decomposition. Thus, the thiadiazole ring closure
was in this case performed by condensation between alkyl/aryl nitrile 9a–d and thiosemicarbazide in concentrated trifluoroacetic
acid at 60 °C (method C, Scheme 1).29 Thiadiazole 6 thus obtained was not isolated and was instead directly used in
the next step without further purification. When it was not possible
to use these strong oxidizing and dehydrating agents because of the
presence of sensitive chemical functions, an alternative synthetic
route that requires oxidation of aryl-thiosemicarbazone, prepared
from the relative aldehydes, with an ethanolic solution of FeCl3 at 60 °C was shown to be successful (method D, Scheme 1).29 Ureido-thiadiazoles 1p–q were prepared
through a reaction of 1b and 6, respectively,
with dimethylcarbamyl chloride in dry dichloromethane (DCM) (Scheme 2). Because it was
not possible to directly prepare catecholic thiadiazole with any of
the experimental procedures described above, 3′,4′-dihydroxy-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole
(1d) and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxy-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole
(1f) were obtained through demethylation of the respective
methoxylated thiadiazoles 1c and 1e, using
boron tribromide (Scheme 3). Finally, compounds 4a–s were all synthesized
through aromatic nucleophilic substitution between the appropriate
commercial alkylamine and 5-amino-2-bromo-1,3,4-thiadiazole (Scheme 4). Nitriles 9a (benzylcyanide) and 9b [4-(aminomethyl)benzonitrile]
were commercially available and used as purchased. 3-(4-Methoxyphenyl-)pyridin-2-carbonitrile
(9c) was instead prepared as depicted in Scheme 5: 3-bromo-5-pyridincarboxaldehyde
was converted first to 3-bromo-5-pyridincarbonitrile (7) with concentrated ammonia in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature,
using iodine as the oxidant.30 Then, 7 was reacted with 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid through the
standard Suzuki reaction to obtain biphenyl nitrile 9c.31 Similarly, for the synthesis of 3-(aminomethyl)benzonitrile
(9d), 3-(bromomethyl)benzonitrile was reacted with potassium
phthalimide under standard SN2 conditions to give the corresponding
phthalimide 8. Phthalimide was then converted to amine
with aqueous hydrazine to give the desired nitrile 9d (Scheme 5). Finally, for the
synthesis of thiosemicarbazones 11a–o, aldehydes 10a–e and 10i–j were commercially
available and used as purchased. Biphenylaldehydes 10k–o were prepared using the Suzuki reaction between 3-bromobenzaldehyde
and the appropriate phenylboronic acid. The same synthetic reaction
was performed between 3-(bromomethyl)benzaldehyde and phenylboronic
acid or 4-cyanophenylboronic acid to give benzyl-benzaldehydes 10f and 10g, respectively. Aldehyde 10h was instead prepared via SN2 reaction between p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3,4-dichlorobenzylchloride. Thus,
aryl aldehydes 10a–o were condensed with thiosemicarbazide
to obtain the respective aryl-thiosemicarbazones (11a–o) (Scheme 6).

PTR1 Inhibition Studies
All 57 new
thiadiazoles 1a–t, 2a–g, 3a–k, and 4a–s were evaluated for
their inhibitory activity against TbPTR1. Compounds
displaying a percentage of inhibition against TbPTR1
above 30% at 50 μM were further analyzed in dose–response
experiments between 0.001 and 100 μM to enable the determination
of their IC50 values. The IC50 value of pyrimethamine
(IC50 = 0.09 μM against TbPTR1),
a DHFR inhibitor also able to inhibit PTR1, was measured routinely
as a standard. The activity data of the entire panel of compounds
are reported in Charts 1–4. The general activity profile of
the studied compounds is shown in Figure 4. Among the 57 thiadiazoles synthesized, 1f, 4c, 4e–f, 4h–i, 4m–o, and 4q were associated with
IC50 values in the range of 16 to 112 μM (Charts 1–4), resulting in a 2 to 12-fold improved inhibition
effect toward TbPTR1 in comparison to the initial
screening hits II–IV (IC50 > 200
μM). With the exception of 1f (TbPTR1, IC50 41 μM), the most active TbPTR1 inhibitors belong to the 2,5-diamino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (series 4) with the best compound 4m showing an
IC50 of 16 μM. TbPTR1 and TbDHFR use similar substrates such as dihydrofolic acid;
thus, PTR1 inhibitors can also interact with DHFR. Therefore,
to evaluate the potential dual PTR1 and DHFR inhibition, all compounds
were tested against TbDHFR. However, none of the
compounds showed any significant inhibitory activity against TbDHFR (Table S3). The compounds
that showed the best inhibitory activity against TbPTR1 were selected for further studies.

Crystallographic Studies of Compound 4c
Cocrystallization trials were performed with ten thiadiazole compounds
that showed the best inhibition against TbPTR1 (1f, 4c, 4e–f, 4h–i, 4m–o, and 4q). Only compound 4c, belonging to the fourth series, resulted in a ternary
complex at an acceptable resolution. 4c is a comparatively
modest inhibitor of TbPTR1 showing an IC50 of 112 μM. The structure of the complex TbPTR1–NADP+–4c was determined
to 1.92 Å resolution (PDB ID: 5IZC). Statistics for the data collection
and refinement are presented in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. Ligand placement in the active site
and key interactions are depicted in Figure 5. 4c adopts the same binding
mode in all four subunits of the enzyme, only with differing orientations
of the thiophene ring. The electron density for 4c is
best defined in subunits A and D. The 4c thiadiazole
ring binds in a π-sandwich between the nicotinamide of NADP+ and Phe97, as previously described. The 2-amino group on
the thiadiazole of 4c is within the hydrogen bonding
distance of both NADP+ phosphate and Ser95 OH. The thiadiazole
nitrogen in position 3 forms a bifurcated interaction with the NADP+ ribose OH and Tyr174 OH. Furthermore, the thiadiazole nitrogen
in position 4 is within the hydrogen bonding distance of Tyr174 OH.
The thiophene moiety of 4c lodges in the hydrophobic
cavity defined by Cys168, Val206, Leu209, Met213, and Trp221. The
above interactions are retained in all four subunits of the TbPTR1 tetramer. Cys168 is chemically modified to S,S-(2-hydroxylethyl)thiocysteine (defined
also as CME in Figure 5) because of the reaction with β-mercaptoethanol present in
the purification buffer.

interactions involving inhibitor 4c (green sticks) in
the TbPTR1 active site. The 4c thiadiazole
ring is sandwiched between the nicotinamide ring of the NADP+ cofactor and the phenyl ring of Phe97, as for compounds I, II, and III. H-bonds are represented
by black dashed lines; water molecules are shown as red spheres. All
model atoms are color coded following atom types, except C atoms for
protein residues are in white, for NADP+ in black, and
for the inhibitor in green. The protein backbone is drawn as a white
cartoon. Note the modified Cys168 as S,S-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiocysteine (CME). Interaction distances are reported
in Table S2.1 in the Supporting Information.

SAR for TbPTR1 Inhibition
Although the design of the 57
compounds was largely based on the crystal structures available for
compounds I–IV, the observed PTR1 inhibition potency
did not reflect the expected effects of the structural modifications.
This suggests that the binding mode observed in the crystal structures
might be altered for the modified compounds. Therefore, to explore
possible alternative binding modes, we docked all synthesized compounds
in the TbPTR1 binding site. Combining the predicted
binding modes with the crystal structures enabled us to explain the SAR
for the compounds’ inhibitory potential against TbPTR1. Common interactions, such as stacking of the thiadiazole core
moiety between Phe97 and nicotinamide, were generally reproduced in
docking. Because of the small size of the ligand core, rotation within
the pocket did however result in different hydrogen bonding patterns,
for example, involving the cofactor phosphate and ribose, Ser95, Asp161,
and Tyr174, as indicated by differing arrangements of the thiadiazole
core in Figure 6B–D.

Figure 6 Docking poses of compounds in TbPTR1. The reference
crystal structure (PDB ID 2X9G) of TbPTR1 is shown in cartoon representation,
with important interacting residues in stick representation with gray
carbons in complex with NADP+ (stick representation, black
carbons). (A) Docked pose of compound 1f (sticks, yellow
carbons, 2x9g-1f_dockedcomplex.pdb in Supporting Information) shown with the crystallographic orientation of
compound IV (from PDB ID 4WCD, pale turquoise carbons) for reference.
(B–D) Sample docking poses of compound 4m (sticks,
orange carbons, 2x9g-4m_dockedcomplex.pdb in Supporting Information), 4o (sticks, brown carbons, 2x9g-4o_dockedcomplex.pdb
in Supporting Information), and 4e (sticks, golden carbons, 2x9g-4e_dockedcomplex.pdb in Supporting Information) with folate from PDB
ID 3BMC (sticks, dark gray carbons) shown for reference. Hydrogen bonds are indicated by black
dotted lines.

A direct connection of the thiadiazole core with an aryl moiety,
as in series 1 (Chart 1: 5-aryl-1,3,4-thiadiazoles), may lead to a competition
for the stacking position in the TbPTR1 binding site,
which pushes the core moiety closer to the cofactor to introduce unfavorable
contacts, as observed in almost all docked complexes of these compounds. Series 1 compounds consistently show low TbPTR1 inhibition. Only compound 1f, bearing a pyrogallol
substituent, presents a moderate IC50 value of 41 μM.
We hypothesize that the pyrogallol moiety occupies the stacking position
and forms several H-bonds with Tyr174 and cofactor phosphates and
ribose (Figure 6A).
Because this alternative binding mode is specific for 1f, it may explain the observed activity. Series 2 and series 3 compounds only yielded <47% inhibition of TbPTR1 at 50 μM. In series 2 (Chart 2: 5-biphenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazoles),
the elongated conformation of the compounds fits the binding pocket
poorly, whereas in series 3 (Chart 3: 5-aryl-aliphatic-1,3,4-thiadiazoles), the
long, flexible aliphatic linkers tend to be disfavored and are often
placed in a polar and thus unfavorable environment, further leading
to an unfavorable placement of substituents. Series 4 (Chart 4: 2,5-diamino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles)
includes nine out of the nineteen compounds that yielded >30% inhibition
of TbPTR1 at 50 μM, resulting in IC50 values in the range of 16–112 μM. Compounds of this
class typically have a linker of 2–3 atoms between thiadiazole
and further aryl substituents, including nitrogen in position 5. The
second amino-nitrogen thereby allows for further favorable interactions,
for example, with the carbonyl group of the cofactor, Asp161, or Tyr174,
as indicated by the bound orientation of compound 4c in
the crystal structure 5IZC (see Figure 5). Hence, series 4 allows the exploitation of
the additional region favorable for H-bond donors, as identified by
the SiteMap calculations (see also Figure 3). Although comparatively small compounds,
such as 4i, show similar binding modes to that observed
in the crystallographic complex of 4c (compare Figure S2A), larger compounds are locked in a
binding orientation closely resembling that of folic acid, as shown
in Figure 6B–D.
A substrate-like complex thereby seems to correlate with enhanced
activity because the docking mode of the majority of actives in this
class best matches the folic acid orientation.

Compound 4m has a linked biphenyl system and is the most active compound
(TbPTR1 IC50 16 μM). The thiadiazole
position is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with the cofactor
and Ser95, and the phenyl ring systems of 4m interact
by π–π interactions and hydrophobic contacts with
Phe97, Met163, Phe171, Tyr174, Met213, and Trp221. Notably, as shown
in Figure 6B, the biphenyl
system adopts a substrate-like orientation, with the first phenyl
ring mimicking the PABA moiety of folic acid and the second phenyl
locking the compound in that orientation by spatial restraints. Similar
observations can be made for compounds 4o (TbPTR1, IC50 25 μM) and 4e (TbPTR1, IC50 31 μM). Interestingly, 4n (TbPTR1, IC50 62 μM) shows an
identical binding mode to 4o but is about 3 times less
active. In summary, compounds that are able to bind in a substrate-like
orientation show the best TbPTR1 inhibition profile.
Despite the fact that direct correlation between the docking score
and the % inhibition or IC50 for the compounds could not
be observed, we were able to deduce likely near native poses and describe
a qualitative correlation between the observed binding mode in the
crystallographic complexes, the docking results, and the anti-PTR1
activity of the compounds (“Docking Protocol Validation”, Supporting Information). Visual inspection of
the interaction pattern and comparison with crystal structures were
used to select the most likely poses, based on experimental evidence.

Antiparasitic In Vitro Evaluation against
Cultured T. brucei
All
compounds were evaluated for inhibitory activity on growth of in vitro
cultured T. b. brucei through a HTS
assay (a cell-based assay with a fluorescent readout) during a phenotypic
screening campaign. The antiparasitic activity is expressed as the
percentage of cell growth inhibition at 50 μM and is reported
in Charts 1–4. For the nine compounds (1b, 1d, 1f, 1m, 1n, 2d, 3f, 3h, and 4i)
showing >75% inhibition, the EC50 was also determined
with results in the range of 0.8–58.0 μM. We observed
no correlation between TbPTR1 inhibition and antiparasitic
activity (Figure 7).
The data distribution in Figure 7 highlights two distinct sets of compounds: cluster
A includes all thiadiazoles that showed antiparasitic activity with
EC50 in the range of 0.8–58.0 μM (1b, 1d, 1f, 1m–n, 2d–e, 3f, 3h, and 4i) but had poor efficacy against the target enzyme (<50% inhibition
of TbPTR1 at 50 μM) and is therefore likely
to have a different target. On the other hand, cluster B comprises
two compounds (4m and 4o) that show the
highest TbPTR1 inhibition (IC50 16 and
25 μM, respectively) but poor antiparasitic activity when tested
as single agents (Figure 7, Chart 4).
In addition, neither 4m nor 4o is able to
inhibit parasitic TbDHFR at 100 μM. We were
able to identify better T. brucei growth
inhibitors with respect to our starting compounds. In particular,
compound 1b showed 7.2-fold better activity with respect
to compound I (EC50 0.8 μM and EC50 5.8 μM). All compounds were also evaluated for in
vitro antiparasitic activity against the intracellular amastigote
stage of L. infantum, but no
compound showed antileishmanial activity >50% inhibition at 50
μM (Table S3, Supporting Information).32 The best compounds with anti-T. brucei activity were 1b and 1f, but they did not show inhibition of TbPTR1. Because of the lack of compounds exhibiting both TbPTR1 inhibition and antiparasitic activity, our interest turned to the evaluation of compounds 4m and 4o in combination with a TbDHFR inhibitor.

inhibition
of the target TbPTR1 at 50 μM and antiparasitic
activity against T. brucei performed
at the same concentration. (A) Thiadiazoles that showed antiparasitic
activity with EC50 in the range of 0.8–58.0 μM
but poor efficacy against the target enzyme. (B) Compounds 4m and 4o, which showed TbPTR1 inhibition
but poor antiparasitic activity as single agents.

Potentiating
Effect of Thiadiazoles in Combination with MTX
Given that
inhibition of TbDHFR alone does not effectively kill
the parasite because of a bypass via TbPTR1, a simultaneous
inhibition of both enzymes should result in an improved antiparasitic
effect.31,32 MTX (a well-known DHFR inhibitor) is a potent
inhibitor of TbDHFR (Ki = 15 nM)33,34 that exerts an inhibitory activity also
against recombinant TbPTR1 (Ki = 50 nM). In standard T. brucei growth conditions, as in our experiments, where the media is supplemented
with 9 μM folic acid, MTX is a poor antitrypanocidal agent showing
an EC50 of 35 ± 3.0 μM, 1000 times higher than
the reported EC50 of 0.012 μM with no folate supplementation.35−37

We compared the antiparasitic
activity of some selected TbPTR1 inhibitors as single
agents and in combination with MTX, resulting in the selection of
four compounds that presented distinct TbPTR1 inhibition
(4m, IC50 = 16 μM; 4o,
IC50 = 25 μM; 4h, IC50 =
70 μM, and 3k, IC50 > 70 μM),
and dose–response antiparasitic studies were performed. Compounds 1m, 2d, and 2e were associated with
34–48% antiparasitic activity at 50 μM, whereas all other
compounds yielded <30% antiparasitic activity. Therefore, the entire
compound library was considered associated with low activity against T. brucei (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The TbPTR1 inhibitors were combined
with equimolar amounts of MTX (the EC50 value for MTX against T. brucei was 35 ± 3.0 μM), and dose–response
curves were determined (Figure 8). The data show a measureable antiparasitic EC50 for the combinations and, in particular, the EC50 of
MTX was reduced by a factor of 4.1 when combined with 4m (EC50 8.6 ± 1.1 μM, Figures 8 and S4) and by
a factor of 2 when combined with 4o (EC50 17.5
± 0.5 μM, Figures 8 and S4). Interestingly, only compounds
showing TbPTR1 inhibition (4m and 4o) were able to potentiate MTX EC50. Although
MTX can inhibit both PTR1 and DHFR enzymes, the observed potentiation
effect can arise from the enhancement of the dual inhibitory effect
caused by supplementary PTR1 inhibition induced by the thiadiazoles
used in the combination. In fact, despite the PTR1 inhibitory activity,
the administration of 50 μM of 4m alone did not
show any significant antiparasitic effect. Similarly, compounds 4o and 4c showed low T. brucei cell inhibitory activity. In addition, an increasing concentration
of 4m induced an increasing inhibitory effect of MTX
in combination, indicating that potentiation occurs. This potentiation
is greater than the simple additive effect (4m has no
intrinsic antiparasitic activity); therefore, the potency of the combination
is much greater than the potency of the single agents that compose
it.

Figure 8 Dose–response
curves for T. b. brucei growth inhibition
for compounds 4m (in blue), 4o (in red), 4h (in green), and 3k (in yellow) in combination
with equimolar amounts of MTX. The dose–response curve for
MTX alone is reported in purple (EC50 = 35 ± 3.0 μM).
From the dose–response curve, a measurable antiparasitic EC50 for the four tested compounds (4m, EC50 = 8.6 ± 1.1 μM; 4o, EC50 = 17.5
± 0.5 μM; 4h, EC50 = 35.6 ±
5.8 μM; and 3k, EC50 = 34.5 ± 3.2
μM) was extrapolated. The dose–response curves are the
merged curves from at least two independent data sets done in triplicate,
whereas the EC50 value in brackets represents the arithmetic
average (±standard deviation) of at least two independent assays.

On the basis of these results, we expected to rescue the
DHFR activity and consequently, parasite vitality, by supplementing
with folic acid, the natural substrate of DHFR. Our compounds display
almost no inhibition of DHFR (Table S3).
It is reported that folic acid competes with MTX for DHFR, displacing
it and reversing DHFR inhibition on a cellular level.38 Folic acid supply is in fact used in clinical settings
to alleviate the toxicity of MTX.39,40 We observed
the same behavior in T. brucei cell
culture. After testing different folic acid concentrations, we observed
that the addition of 1 mM folic acid was able to reduce the antiparasitic
activity of MTX alone, safeguarding the cell survival, without interfering
with parasite growth (Figure 9A). Focusing on compound 4m, which showed the
best TbPTR1 IC50 value and potentiation
of the antiparasitic activity of MTX, we observed that supplementation
with 1 mM folic acid was able to rescue cell growth treated with 4m and MTX (Figure 9B). Our data suggest that PTR1 inhibitors potentiate the antiparasitic
effect of MTX, probably by preventing the PTR1 bypass for the reduction
of folate.

b. brucei growth inhibition induced by MTX (A, reverse
triangle and filled line) or the equimolar combination of 4m + MTX (B, reverse triangle and filled line). The depicted dose–response
curves are the merged curves from at least two independent assays.

Folic acid administration reverses the effect of
MTX (by binding both to DHFR and PTR1) up to almost the original activity
of MTX alone, but does not abrogate the effect of MTX completely.
This nonphysiological folate concentration could reduce the antitrypanosomal
potency of MTX through competition for drug uptake.36 Thus, the low effect of MTX on the parasite cells is due
to a low amount of compound passing into the cells, and as a consequence,
there is a low amount of MTX inside the cells and low inhibition of TbPTR1 and TbDHFR. Instead the trans-membrane
crossing of 4m and 4o is different from
that of MTX because they have a folate-unrelated structure. This allows 4m to be competitive with respect to MTX in the binding toward
PTR1. Therefore, coadministering the thiadiazole with MTX, the compound
is delivered to the cell and is available to induce supplementary
inhibition on PTR1, thus causing an overall potentiation effect. More
experiments are ongoing to clarify the potentiation effect of PTR1
inhibitors using other classes of PTR1 inhibitors.

Early Compound-Mediated Toxicity and Liability Studies
Independent of the effect of any antiparasitic potential of compounds,
they were evaluated using a panel of early-toxicity assays comprising
cytotoxicity (A549, human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line
and WI-38, human lung fibroblasts), mitochondrial toxicity (786-O,
human renal carcinoma cell line), hERG inhibition,31 cytochrome P450 inhibition (CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4),31 and Aurora
B kinase inhibition. These experiments were performed using 10 μM
of each compound and the output was expressed as % inhibition, which
is displayed as a heat map in Figure 10. An acceptable profile for compounds at this stage
in the drug-discovery process should exhibit <30% inhibition at
10 μM in the case of mitochondrial toxicity, hERG, CYP isoforms, and Aurora B kinase, whereas the percentage of
A549/WI-38 cell growth should be >70%.32 Almost all evaluated compounds (series 1–3)
showed a safe profile, revealing that the thiadiazole scaffold has
a well-tolerated liability profile that can be further explored during
their development. Some compounds in series 4 showed
a liability risk for their effects on hERG, CYP2D6,
and WI-38 cells, which appears to be due to the introduction of the
second nitrogen atom that can induce a toxic effect on the thiadiazole
core. The cytotoxicity of the compounds selected for combination studies
(4m, 4o, 3k, 4h) at 100 μM alone and in combination with equimolar MTX was
evaluated using THP-1 macrophage-like cells. Notably, no increase
in toxicity was seen in THP-1 cells for compound 4m (Figure 11). For the two
compounds active against TbPTR1 (4m and 4o), IC50 against hERG, cytochrome
P450, and mitochondrial toxicity were determined (reported in Supporting Information). We observed that the
dose of compounds 4m, 4o, 4c, and 3k was 4 μM in the potentiation assays.
Therefore, considering the toxicity of the compounds at 10 μM,
we can extrapolate that only CYP1A2 shows around 50% of inhibition
at 4 μM in the combination studies. In the case of hERG, CYP2D6, CYP2A9, CYP2C19, and mitochondrial toxicity, there is
a selectivity index of around 3–4 fold, thus showing an acceptable
profile.

for all synthesized compounds. Assays were performed to assess inhibition
of hERG and five CYP isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6,
and 3A4), growth inhibition of A549 and W1-38 cell lines, and mitochondrial
toxicity at 10 μM. The hDHFR inhibition was
determined at 100 μM. The data, expressed as percentage values,
were organized by adopting a color code for rapid and intuitive visualization.
The ideal compound should have all tiles blue, indicating a safe toxicological
profile for progressing into the development pipeline. The cells are

to red (100% of inhibitory activity at the tested concentration) for
CYP isoforms, hERG, hDHFR, and mitochondrial
toxicity.

Conclusions
In the present work, we have established an efficient platform to
identify and characterize hits for further development toward the
discovery of more potent antitrypanosomatidic agents. A crystallization
screen with a library of previously identified inhibitors of LmPTR1 with a thiadiazole scaffold was performed, and it
resulted in structures of four new TbPTR1-cofactor-inhibitor
complexes, which guided the design of new thiadiazoles in a structure-based
approach. Compounds were synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory
activity against TbPTR1 and for antiparasitic activity
in a phenotypic assay against T. brucei. Two of the best compounds yielded IC50 values of 16
and 25 μM against TbPTR1 and share a 2,5-diamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole
scaffold. Compound 4c, a representative of this class,
was successfully crystallized in a ternary complex with TbPTR1 (TbPTR1–NADP+–4c), supporting the binding mode of the earliest compounds
(I–III). With respect to our starting compounds, I–IV, we have improved the compounds’ biological
profiles, with 23 out of 57 compounds displaying a better PTR1 inhibition
profile. Five compounds showed a better antiparasitic effect with
respect to I and IV.

In previous experiments
performed on LmPTR1 thiadiazole inhibitors, we have
shown the combination effect with pyrimethamine on promastigotes of L. infantum and mexicana. This work specifically addressed the ability of TbPTR1 inhibitors to potentiate the effect of the DHFR inhibitor MTX
against T. brucei by performing studies
in combination with compounds 3k, 4h, 4o, and 4m. The potentiating effect was observed
only with the compounds inhibiting TbPTR1, 4o and 4m. In particular, we focused on compound 4m, which showed the greatest inhibition against the target
enzyme, TbPTR1. When combined with MTX, the EC50 of MTX against T. brucei improved 4.1 times (EC50 MTX alone 35 μM; EC50 MTX and 4m 8.6 μM). No increase in the
toxicity of the PTR1–DHFR inhibitor combination with respect
to the single compounds was observed. In addition, we demonstrated
that the potentiation activity of a PTR1 inhibitor combined with MTX
could be reversed through administration of folic acid, the natural
substrate of DHFR. The molecular mechanism that might explain this
reversal of inhibition is likely complex and will be studied in future
work. By adopting an efficient early hit discovery platform, we showed
that the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole scaffold can be considered a promising
approach for the development of anti-T. brucei agents targeting TbPTR1. Whereas the compounds
show modest IC50 values against both the enzymes and parasites
in isolation, our results suggest that combining the PTR1 inhibitors
with DHFR inhibitors provides a valid strategy for developing more
potent antiparasitic agents.

Section
Synthetic Chemistry
The chemical procedures and characterization of all synthesized compounds
and the respective intermediates are reported in the Supporting Information.

X-ray
Crystallography
TbPTR1-cofactor-inhibitor
complexes with I and II were prepared by
incubating protein (6 mg/mL, 1 mM NADPH, 10 mM dithiothreitol) with
2.5 μL of a 5 mM solution of inhibitor in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 on ice for 1 h before crystallization.
Hanging drops (1.5 μL of protein solution and 1.5 μL of
reservoir) were incubated over 1 mL of reservoir (2.7 M sodium acetate,
10 mM sodium citrate pH 4.5). Crystals grew at 20 °C in a few
days. Complexes with compounds III, IV,
and 4c were obtained by soaking the preformed crystals
of a TbPTR1–cofactor binary complex obtained
in sitting drops equilibrated against reservoir (1.5–2.5 M
sodium acetate and 100 mM sodium citrate pH 5.0). The crystals were
soaked for 4–6 h in the crystallization buffer containing 2–4
mM of each compound dissolved in DMSO (without exceeding a DMSO/crystal
solution ratio of 1:9). The crystals were transferred in a cryo-protectant
(precipitant plus 30% glycerol) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen
or taken directly from mother liquor and flash-cooled. Data were recorded
using a Rigaku MicroMax 007 rotating anode and an R-AXIS IV++ dual image plate detector system at the European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility (Grenoble, France) on beamline BM30A with an ADSC Q315r detector,
at the Diamond Light Source (Didcot, UK) on beamline I04 with a PILATUS
6M-F detector, or at the Elettra Synchrotron (Trieste, Italy) on beamline
XRD1 with a PILATUS 2M detector. Data were processed with MOSFLM41 or XDS42 and then
scaled with SCALA43 with the CCP4 software
suite.44 The structures were solved by
molecular replacement45 using TbPTR1 (PDB: 2X9G) as the starting model.27 Rigid body
refinement and rounds of restrained refinement were carried out using
REFMAC5.46 Inspection of electron density,
model manipulation, and identification of solvent, ions, and ligands
were done using COOT.47 Figures were generated
with CCP4mg.48 The coordinates and structure
factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession
codes 2YHI, 2YHU, 4WCD, 4WCF, and 5IZC for compounds I, II, III, IV, and 4c, respectively. In TbPTR1–II and TbPTR1–III, Cys168
is chemically modified to S-oxycysteine (defined
as CSX) indicative of a reactive cysteine (see Figure 2B,C).

Computational
Docking
The three-dimensional (3D) structures of the compounds
were created from SMILES strings and optimized with the OPLS_2005
force field49 using Maestro (Schrödinger,
LLC).50 Ligand preparation included the
generation of stereoisomers (up to eight) and low-energy ring conformations
(one per compound) as well as determination of ionization states and
tautomers for pH 7.0 ± 0.5 using Epik. Highly conserved structural
water was identified by the WatCH clustering approach.51 Briefly, 99 chains from TbPTR1
crystal structures (see Table S5 for a
list of structures) were superimposed, and their crystallographic
water positions were clustered with a distance criterion of 2.4 Å
for considering identical water oxygen positions. Seventeen water
sites with at least 50% conservation were considered to be conserved. TbPTR1 receptors for docking and SiteMap analysis52 were composed of chain A of the respective crystal
structure and a C-terminal tripeptide from the neighboring subunit,
Val266 to Ala268, pointing into the active site of chain A. Crystallographic
solvent molecules were removed and replaced with conserved water molecules
(from WatCH clustering) for docking studies. SiteMap calculations
were conducted with PDB IDs 2YHI, 2YHU, 4WCD, and 4WCF. Docking was carried
out to PDB ID 2X9G.27 Bond-order assignment and hydrogen
atom addition was done with PrepWizard.49N- and C-termini of chain A were capped with N-acetyl and N-methyl amide groups, respectively.
The NADP+ cofactor protonation state was computed at pH
7.0 ± 0.5. Protein protonation states were assigned for pH 7.0
using PROPKA.53 The H-bond network was
optimized, and all hydrogens were subjected to a restrained minimization.
For the SiteMap analysis, the site was defined by the thiadiazole
core moiety of the ligand. A surrounding region of 3 Å was examined.
Ten site points were required per reported site, and site maps were
cropped at 3 Å from their nearest site point. Otherwise, standard
values were used. For docking, a 20 Å × 20 Å ×
20 Å docking grid was centered on Phe97. The hydroxyl groups
of Ser95, Cys168, Tyr174, and NADP+ ribose were set rotatable.
Docking was performed with Glide (Schrödinger, LLC)54−56 using the SP protocol (standard
precision). The maximum ligand size and rotatable bond count were
kept at standard values. A scaling factor of 0.80 for the ligand van
der Waals radii and a partial charge cutoff of 0.15 were used. Ligands
were treated as flexible, nitrogen inversions, and ring conformations
were sampled. Nonplanar conformations were penalized when performing
bias sampling of amide torsions. Epik state penalties were added to
the docking score; intramolecular hydrogen bonds were rewarded; and
conjugated π group planarity was enhanced. Twenty poses per
ligand were subjected to postdocking energy minimization, employing
a pose rejection threshold of 0.5 kcal/mol. Up to 10 final solutions
were collected.

The validation of the docking protocol was based
on cross-docking studies of the crystallized compounds I, II, III, IV, and 4c. As shown in Table S6 and as discussed
in the “Docking Validation section” of the Supporting Information, near-native poses were
overall reproduced with the current protocol and typically found within
0.3 kcal/mol of the best-scoring docking solution, as ranked by the
docking score. Poses were therefore ranked by the Glide docking score,
and all poses within 1.0 kcal/mol of the top scoring solution were
further analyzed. A visual inspection of the interaction pattern and
comparison with crystal structures 3BMC (TbPTR1 in complex with
folate) and 5IZC (TbPTR1 in complex with 4c) were used
to select the most likely poses on the basis of experimental evidence.
Docking results are also given in Table S7 in the Supporting Information.

Biological
Assays
Protein Expression and Purification
TbPTR1, LmPTR1, TbDHFR, LmDHFR, and hDHFR were obtained
and purified as reported in our previous work.32 The kinetic characterization (Km and kcat) of the enzymes is reported
in Table S8 of the Supporting Information.

TbPTR1, LmPTR1, TbDHFR, LmDHFR,
and hDHFR Enzyme Assays
The thiadiazoles
were a small part of a library of many thousands of molecules that
we tested within the three-year European project NMTrypI (http://fp7-nmtrypi.eu). Because of the sharing of technologies within the NMTrypI platform,
we were able to perform the enzymatic studies against TbPTR1 and LmPTR1 and the early-toxicity assays by
HTS methodologies. The in vitro assays used in the current study were
based upon those reported in the literature, and the kinetic data
are comparable (Table S8).34 Because PTR1 enzymes use H2B as a substrate
and also require NADPH for the reaction, the reduction of H2B to H4B by PTR1 is nonenzymatically linked with the reduction
of cytochrome c in this assay, which is detected
at 550 nm. The formation of cyt c Fe2+ results in a signal increase in the photometric readout.

TbPTR1 and LmPTR1 activities were assayed
in a buffer containing 20 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0). The final reaction
mixture contained the test compound in a range of concentrations and TbPTR1/LmPTR1 (6.0 nM/12.0 nM), H2B (0.3 μM/3.0 μM), cytochrome c (100
μM/100 μM), and NADPH (500 μM/500 μM). The
final assay volume was 50 μL in 384-well clear plates (Greiner
Bio-One, 781101). Compound screening was performed by addition of
the compound to assay plates (in 100% DMSO), followed by addition
of 45 μL reaction mix (enzyme, H2B, and cytochrome c in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer). A preread was made at
550 nm using an EnVision Multilabel Reader 2103 (PerkinElmer Inc,
US), followed by incubation of the assay plates at 30 °C for
10 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of 5 μL of NADPH
(from a stock at 5 mM in ultrapure water), followed by kinetically
reading the assay plates at 550 nm using the EnVision Multilabel Reader
at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min and calculating the slope of the reaction
in each well. The screening data were analyzed using ActivityBase
(IDBS), and for outlier elimination in the control wells, the 3-sigma
method was applied. On the basis of the slope, data were normalized
to the positive control MTX for TbPTR1/LmPTR1 (1 μM/50 μM, yielding 100% inhibition) and negative
controls (1% DMSO, yielding 0% inhibition), and % inhibition was calculated
for all samples. The measurement at time 0 min was used to flag the
interfering samples. Each compound was tested in triplicate, and the
pIC50 value, standard deviation, Hill slope, and minimum
signal and maximum signal for each dose–response curve were
obtained using a four-parameter logistic fit in the XE module of ActivityBase
(IDBS). Compounds displaying a percentage of inhibition against TbPTR1 above 30% at 50 μM were further analyzed at
concentrations from 0.001 to 100 μM for the determination of
IC50. The IC50 value of pyrimethamine (IC50 = 0.09 μM against TbPTR1), a DHFR
inhibitor also able to inhibit PTR1, was measured routinely as a standard.
However, not all compounds selected gave measurable IC50 in the dose–response assays. LmDHFR, TbDHFR, and hDHFR activities were assessed
spectrophotometrically as previously described, and the values for
the kinetic constants characterizing each enzyme (Km) were comparable to literature values (Table S8).22

hERG Cardiotoxicity Assay
This assay made use of Invitrogen’s Predictor hERG fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. The assay uses a membrane
fraction containing the hERG channel (Predictor hERG membrane) and a high-affinity red fluorescent hERG channel ligand or “tracer” (Predictor hERG Tracer Red), whose displacement by test compounds can be determined
in a homogenous, FP-based format.32

Cytochrome P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4
Assays
These assays made use of the Promega P450-Glo assay
platform. Each CYP450 assay made use of microsomal preparations of
cytochromes from baculovirus-infected insect cells. Action of the
CYP450 enzymes on each substrate ultimately resulted in the generation
of light, and a decrease in this was indicative of inhibition of the
enzyme.32

Cytotoxicity Assay against A549 and W1-38 Cells
The assays
were performed using the CellTiter-Glo assay from Promega. The assay
detects cellular ATP content, with the amount of ATP being directly
proportional to the number of cells present. The A549 cells were obtained
from DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures,
Braunschweig, Germany) and W1-38 cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC
CCL-75) and were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) with fetal calf serum (FCS) (10% v/v), streptomycin, (100 μg/mL)
and penicillin G (100 U/mL).32

Assessment of Mitochondrial Toxicity
This
assay made use of MitoTracker Red chloromethyl-X-rosamine (CMXRos)
uptake and high content imaging to monitor compound-mediated mitochondrial
toxicity in the 786-O (renal carcinoma) cell line. Cells were maintained
using the Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium containing
2 mM glutamine, FCS (10% v/v), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and
penicillin G (100 U/mL).32

In Vitro Evaluation of Activity against T. brucei
The assay relies on indirect determination
of parasite population viability by quantification of total DNA present
in the well using the SYBR Green I DNA fluorescent dye. Briefly, the
assay consisted of incubating bloodstream forms of the T. b. brucei Lister 427 strain in the presence of
compounds for 72 h, followed by cell lysis and addition of the SYBR
Green I dye.57 Pentamidine at 120 nM was
used as the reference compound showing an EC50 of 3.8 ±
0.48 nM comparable with the value reported in the literature.58 DMSO-treated parasites were used as negative
controls and pentamidine-treated parasites and blank wells (without
parasites) were used as positive controls. Compounds and controls
were plated in a semiautomated process that utilizes the liquid handler
Janus MDT (PerkinElmer), which is equipped with a 384 pipetting head
capable of dispensing a minimum volume of 0.5 μL. As T. b. brucei is sensitive to DMSO and tolerates a
maximum of approximately 1% DMSO, compound libraries dissolved in
100% DMSO must be diluted at least 200-fold with the aid of “intermediate
plates”. Following compound plating in the final assay plate,
50 μL of a parasite suspension at 8000 trypanosomes/mL was seeded
to the assay and control plates and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. At the assay endpoint, 15 μL of the lysis
solution (30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 7.5 mM EDTA, 0.012% saponin, and
0.12% Triton X-100) was added to the plates containing 0.5 μL
of SYBR Green I (10 000×, Life Technologies) per 1 mL
of lysis solution. The plates were shaken for 30 s at 800 rpm in a
MixMate (Eppendorf) and incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature.
The plates were then read for fluorescence at the microplate reader
EnVision (PerkinElmer). Compounds that yielded >80% inhibition
of parasite growth at 50 μM were selected for EC50 determinations. However, not all selected compounds gave reliable
EC50 data in the dose–response assay.

In Vitro Evaluation of Activity against T. brucei for MTX Potentiation Assays and Folic Acid
Supplementation Experiment
T. b. brucei Lister 427 bloodstream forms were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a complete HMI-9 medium, supplemented with 10% FCS and
100 UI/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. The cultures were diluted until
a cell density of 2 × 106/mL was reached. The efficacy
of compounds against T. brucei bloodstream
forms was evaluated using a modified resazurin-based assay previously
described.46 The compounds were prepared
from a stock solution in 10 mM DMSO and diluted in HMI-9 (supplemented
or not with 1 mM folic acid, Sigma-Aldrich) to 40 μM work solution
(0.4% DMSO, with the DMSO limit in the assay being 0.4%). For the
combination assays, 40 μM equimolar mixture was prepared using
20 μM test compound and 20 μM MTX. The 40 μM work
solution was then used to perform serial dilutions (1:2) in a 96-well
plate. Upon compound addition to the test plate, the mid-log bloodstream
forms were added (100 μL) in complete HMI-9 medium (supplemented
or not with 1 mM folic acid) at a final cell density of 1 × 104/mL in a final well volume of 200 μL with a maximum
DMSO concentration of 0.2%. Following incubation for 72 h at 37 °C
and 5% CO2, 20 μL of 0.5 mM resazurin solution was
added, and the plates were incubated further for 4 h under the same
conditions. Fluorescence was measured at 540 and 620 nm excitation
and emission wavelengths, respectively, using a Synergy 2 multi-mode
reader (BioTek). The antitrypanosomatid effect was evaluated by the
determination of the IC50 value (concentration required
to inhibit growth by 50%) and calculated by the nonlinear regression
analysis using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software,
San Diego, California, USA (www.graphpad.com). It was not
possible to analyze the combination of 4m with MTX by
adopting an isobologram approach, as described by Chou.59 This approach requires the use of both compounds
at their EC50 potency in the combination, which is impossible
to be detected for compound 4m having no intrinsic antiparasitic
activity as a single agent at the tested concentrations. Folic acid
(1 mM) was chosen on the basis of the following experiments. The stock
solution of 10 mM folic acid dissolved in NaOH solution was used to
perform a dose–response curve with folic acid alone to evaluate
the maximum amount we could use without compromising parasite growth
due to pH modification of the media. The highest concentration that
we could use was 1 mM without interfering with the parasite growth
or significantly changing the pH of the media. The IC50 values reported are the averages of the results obtained in at least
two independent experiments. Pentamidine was used as the reference
drug and internal control in all assays. The average pentamidine EC50 for the assays was 2.28 ± 1.18 nM.

Cytotoxicity Assessment against THP-1 Macrophages
The effect of compounds 3k, 4h, 4m, and 4o on THP-1-derived macrophages was assessed
by the colorimetric MTT assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide]. Briefly, 1 × 106 THP-1 cells
were differentiated into macrophages by addition of 20 ng/mL of phorbol-myristate
13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 18 h, followed by replacement
with a fresh medium and further incubation for 24 h. The cells were
incubated with compounds ranging from 100 to 3 μM after dilution
in the RPMI complete medium containing a maximum amount of 1% DMSO.
After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the
medium was removed and 0.5 mg/mL MTT solution was added. The plates
were incubated for 4 additional hours to allow viable cells to convert
MTT into a purple formazan product. Solubilization of formazan crystals
was achieved by addition of 2-propanol, and absorbance was read at
570 nm using a Synergy 2 multi-mode reader (BioTek). Cytotoxicity
was evaluated by the determination of the CC50 value (drug
concentration that reduced the percentage of viable cells by 50%)
and calculated by the nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad
Prism version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California,
USA (www.graphpad.com).
