Replacement
of volatile organic compound solvents by greener or
more environmentally sustainable solvents is becoming increasingly
important due to the increasing health and environmental concerns.
In the present work, a bioderived solvent, soybean oil methyl ester,
which is better known as biodiesel and is a nonvolatile organic compound,
was used as a solvent to replace the fossil solvent (kerosene) for
phenol extraction. First, biodiesel was selected as an optional solvent
to replace kerosene based on Hansen solubility parameter calculation
results. Second, the effects of solvent concentration, equilibrium
pH of the aqueous phase, temperature, extraction time, etc. on phenol
extraction were examined. The results show that biodiesel has strong
extraction ability on phenol extraction than that of kerosene. An
acidic environment decreases the phase disengagement time. Phenol
extraction reached equilibrium in 30 s of contact time at room temperature. McCabe–Thiele
diagram calculation results show that the phenol extraction efficiency
can reach 98% in three theoretical stages at an A/O ratio of 10:1
(Cyanex923 + biodiesel). Finally, the extraction mechanism indicated
that biodiesel could reduce the intermolecular hydrogen bond forces
in the extractant so as to improve the extraction efficiency.

==== Body
Introduction
The organic fossil solvents used in industrial
applications have
been mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including alcohols,
ethers, and aliphatic compounds, as well as organic derivatives of
halogenated hydrocarbons. Most of these organic compounds are volatile,
toxic, flammable, and detrimental to the environment.1 Due to the extensive attention to environmental pressure
and the increasing pressure on the management and control of VOCs,
it is particularly important to choose more green and environmentally
friendly organic solvents.

Bioderived solvents are renewable
resources that can be extracted
from plants and algae. They are green solvents, less toxic, and biocompatible.2 Recently, bioderived solvents have been applied
to various areas, including organic synthesis,3 catalysis,4 biotransformation,5 separations of rare earths,6 and extraction.7 To date, although
biodiesel has been used as a solvent in extraction,8 there is still lack of complete study on the application
of bioderived solvents in the solvent extraction.

Phenol is
widely used in petrochemical industries and other chemical
industries.9 As a result, phenol is extensively
present in the effluents of these manufacturing plants10 and are inevitably introduced into waste water.
Solvent extraction is an effective method for recovering phenol.11 Impregnated resin12 with Cyanex923, a solid extractant, was used for extraction, and
the kinetics of extraction was studied. The common liquid extractants
used in industry include 2-octanol,13 TBP
+ kerosene,14 Cyanex923 + kerosene,15 etc.

In this work, biodiesel was selected
as a solvent to replace kerosene
in the solvent extraction of phenol from aqueous solution. The influence
of solvent concentration (kerosene and biodiesel), temperature, A/O
ratio, and equilibrium pH on phenol extraction was investigated. Moreover,
the equilibrium data was regressed by an empirical model and the necessary
theoretical stages of extraction were calculated by McCabe–Thiele
diagrams. Finally, the related extraction mechanism was also discussed.

Results
and Discussion
Graphical Estimation of the Normalized Hansen
Solubility Parameter
(HSP) Values of the Extractant
The physical properties of
extractants and solvents are shown in Table 1(16) The main component
of kerosene is aliphatic kerosene.

Table 1 Physical Properties
of Extractants
and Diluents
chemical	formula	av MW (g/mol)	ρ (g/cm3)	solubility (g/L, 298 K)	
kerosene	CH3(CH2)8-16CH3(97 wt %), C6H5(CH2)1-4CH3(3 wt %)	142.17–254.30	0.800	insoluble	
Cyanex923	(CH3(CH2)7-9)3PO	340–350	0.879	<0.1	
biodiesel	CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7COOCH3	296.49	0.874	insoluble	
According to eqs 9–14, HSP of several extractants could
be estimated using the graphical method proposed by Teas et al.17 that the three components of the HSP are used
as reference axes in a diagram. Equation 1 is an example for the coordinates on the dispersion
axis. The ternary HSP diagram of solvents and extractants is shown
in Figure 1. 1  In Figure 1, the position
of water is in the lower left corner
of the diagram, whereas the solvents and extractants are at the top.
The normalized HSP values of the solvents and extractants are far
from the ones of water is refer to the
low solubility. As the distance between biodiesel and phenol is shorter
than the distance between kerosene and phenol, the capability of biodiesel
for dissolving phenol could be better than that of kerosene. Although
there is a certain distance between the biodiesel and kerosene, the
position between Cyanex923
+ biodiesel and Cyanex923 + kerosene is very close, which means kerosene
has the potential to be replaced by biodiesel. A bioderived solvent,
biodiesel, is selected as a solvent for phenol extraction in this
work.

the area where the HSP of the extractants is expected).

Effects of Phase Contacting Time on Extraction
The
data on phase contacting time12 is required
to analyze and design an extraction process especially on an industrial
scale. In this paper, the effects of phase contacting time on phenol
extraction in biodiesel and kerosene solvents are studied. The results
are shown in Figure 2. The phenol (2500 mg/L) was extracted with 92 vol % biodiesel +
8 vol % Cyanex923 and 92 vol % kerosene + 8 vol % Cyanex923 at an
A/O ratio of 20:1, respectively. It can be found that the phenol extraction
efficiency increased with the increase of contact time and reached
equilibrium in 30 s. The contact time of subsequent extraction experiments
was set as 50 s.

Figure 2 Effect of extraction time on phenol extraction by different
extractants
(stirring speed = 400 rpm, PhOH = 2500 mg/L, A/O ratio = 20:1, pH
= 7, T = 298 K).

Effect of Solvent Concentration
The comparisons of
phenol extraction by different concentrations of kerosene and biodiesel
are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Variation in phenol extraction efficiency with respect to the volume
concentration of solvents (PhOH = 2500 mg/L, A/O ratio = 10:1, pH
= 7; T = 298 K).

The results show that the efficiency of phenol extraction
decreases
with the increasing solvent concentration of both kerosene and biodiesel.
When the solvent concentration is higher than 92%, the extraction
of phenol has obvious difference. Compared to that of kerosene being used as a solvent,
biodiesel has high extraction efficiency. This could be explained
as the biodiesel has strong extraction ability on phenol extraction
than kerosene.

Effect of Temperature on Phenol Extraction
The effect
of temperature on phenol extraction was studied in the range of 298–328
K (Figure 4). It was
found that D increased with the decrease of the temperature.

Figure 4 Effect
of temperature on phenol extraction with different extractants
(PhOH = 2500 mg/L, A/O ratio = 10:1, pH = 7).

The enthalpy change of the extraction, ΔH, could be calculated from the slope of the log D versus 1000/T by the van’t Hoff equation18 (eq 2). 2  where R = 8.314 is the universal
gas constant and C is a constant for the system.

The relationship between log D and 1000/T in different solvents is shown in Figure 4, and the calculated ΔH values are listed in Table 2. ΔH could be calculated to −9.459
or −11.22 kJ/mol, which was similar to the bond energy of the
hydrogen bond. The results show that ΔH <
0 in phenol extraction, which indicated that the extraction process
is exothermic. Therefore, the extraction experiment is suitable at
room temperature.

Effect of pH on Phenol Extraction
Phenol is a weak
acid that dissociates into PhO– and H+, with the dissociation acid equation defined as eq 3. 3  The form of phenol in varying pH values is
different. Li et al. find that phenol has UV–vis absorption
at 270, 287, and 300 nm, which depends on the pH of solution. All
experiments in this work are conducted in acidic and neutral environment
wherein phenol only has absorption at 270 nm.19 When the pH is less than or equal to 7, the form of most phenol
existing in water phase is PhOH. When the pH is more than 7, the form
of most phenol existing in water phase is PhO–.
It is worth noting that the pH of the original phenol solution is
7. To determine the effects of pH on phenol extraction behavior, the
extractants (92 vol % biodiesel + 8 vol % Cyanex923, 92 vol % kerosene
+ 8 vol % Cyanex923, and 100% biodiesel) were used for phenol extraction
at various pH values. The results of extraction efficiency and phase
disengagement time (PDT) are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.

Figure 5 Variation
of efficiency with respect to the pH value (PhOH = 2500
mg/L, A/O = 10:1, T = 298 K).

Figure 6 Variation of the PDT with respect to the pH value (PhOH = 2500
mg/L, A/O = 10:1, T = 298 K).

In Figure 5, it
was observed that the efficiency in all three extractants decreased
with the increase of pH. The reason is that phenol was extracted in
the molecular form and alkaline environment restrained phenol extraction
of the mixed solvents. The phenol extraction capacity followed the
sequence: 92 vol % biodiesel + 8 vol % Cyanex923 > 92 vol % kerosene
+ 8 vol % Cyanex923 > 100% biodiesel. Using biodiesel as a solvent
(92 vol % biodiesel + 8 vol % Cyanex923), the extraction efficiency
could reach about 80%.

PDT is a critical parameter in determining
the usefulness of a
solvent extraction system. The result of PDT at various pH values
is shown in Figure 6. The PDT of three extractants increases with the increase of pH,
and the acidic solution environment enhances the separation of organic
phase from aqueous phase. The PDT of 100% biodiesel is generally longer
than those of other extractants, but the PDT shortened when mixed
with Cyanex923 in proportion. Based on the results above, it can be
known that the acidic solution environment is beneficial to phenol
extraction by different extractants and solvents.

Isotherms of
Phenol Extraction
The phenol extraction
isotherms were obtained using different kinds of extractants with
the same initial phenol concentration in aqueous phase (Figures 7 and 8). The results show that the maximum phenol loading of 92 vol % biodiesel
+ 8 vol % Cyanex923 system reached to 36 500 mg/L, which is
higher than that of the 92 vol % kerosene + 8 vol % Cyanex923 system
(21 100 mg/L). Moreover, the phenol extraction efficiency of
these extractants decreased with the increase of the A/O ratio. A/O
of 10:1 was selected in subsequent experiments from the view of industrial
application.

(PhOH =
2500 mg/L, pH = 7, T = 298 K).

Figure 8 Variation of efficiency with respect to A/O (PhOH = 2500 mg/L,
pH = 7, T = 298 K).

Extraction Stages Estimated by the McCabe–Thiele Method
McCabe–Thiele diagram is an import method to determine the
theoretical stages for the liquid–liquid solvent extraction
process.20Figure 9 shows the McCabe–Thiele diagram constructed
for phenol extraction by different solvent systems at pH 7 and 298
K (92 vol % biodiesel + 8 vol % Cyanex923 and 92 vol % kerosene +
8 vol % Cyanex923). Using 92 vol % kerosene + 8 vol % Cyanex923 as
the extractant, four theoretical extraction stages would suffice to
remove the phenol from 2000 to 10 mg/L at an A/O ratio of 10:1. In
contrast, only three theoretical extraction stages are required for
the 92 vol % biodiesel + 8 vol % Cyanex923 system.

diagrams of extractants for the determination
of the phenol extraction stage. (a) 92 vol % kerosene + 8 vol % Cyanex923;
(b) 92 vol % biodiesel + 8 vol % Cyanex923.

Extraction Mechanism
To illustrate the extraction mechanism
of the extraction reaction, the extracted complex was characterized
with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The characteristic
spectra of organic phase at different loading conditions are shown
in Figure 10.

Figure 10 FTIR spectra
of organic phase in the P=O stretching vibration
region: (a) kerosene; (b) Cyanex923; (c) biodiesel; (d) 92 vol % kerosene
+ Cyanex923; (e) 92 vol % biodiesel + Cyanex923; (f) complex- 92 vol
% kerosene + Cyanex923; (g) complex- 92 vol % biodiesel + Cyanex923.

The bands from 1260 to 1110 cm–1 are attributed
to the P=O stretching vibration of Cyanex923.21 The P=O stretching vibration peak of pure TRPO was
located at 1153 cm–1, but the P=O stretching
vibration peak of Cyanex923 had shifted from 1153 to 1166 cm–1 after diluting to 8 vol % with kerosene and from 1153 to 1170 cm–1 after diluting to 8 vol % with biodiesel. The results
suggested that Cyanex923 molecules interacted with each other, possibly
because the O atom on the P=O bond formed a hydrogen bond with
the H atom on the carbon chain of another Cyanex923 molecule. When
biodiesel was added as a diluent, the hydrogen bond of Cyanex923 might
be weakened. Therefore, the stretching vibration peak of P=O
is moved to a higher wavenumber and is better than that of kerosene.
After extraction, the P=O stretching vibration peak of 92 vol
% kerosene + Cyanex923 has shifted from 1166 to 1149 cm–1 and the P=O stretching vibration peak of 92 vol % biodiesel
+ Cyanex923 has shifted from 1170 to 1146 cm–1.
This indicated the existence of the hydrogen-bonding interactions
between P=O groups and phenol molecules. FTIR spectra of extractants
and complexes, showed in Figure 11, indicated that phenol was extracted due to the O–H
stretching vibration peak of phenol at 3648 cm–1. The C=O stretching vibration peak of biodiesel at 1744 cm–1 has not shifted after extraction. Therefore, biodiesel
improves the extraction efficiency by reducing the intermolecular
hydrogen bond forces in the extractant.

and complexes: (d) 92 vol % kerosene
+ Cyanex923; (e) 92 vol % biodiesel + Cyanex923; (f) complex- 92 vol

Conclusions
A
biosolvent (biodiesel) and Cyanex923 have been shown to be effective
for the extraction of phenol. According to the HSP calculated, kerosene had the potential
to be replaced by biodiesel as a solvent in phenol extraction. The
phenol extraction efficiency decreased with the increasing solvent
concentration of both kerosene and biodiesel. Biodiesel had strong
extraction ability for phenol extraction than that of kerosene. Phenol
extraction reached equilibrium in 30 s of contact time, and room temperature
was optional. PDT was decreased in the acidic solution environment
and increased in the alkaline environment. From the calculation results
of the McCabe–Thiele method, phenol extraction could reach
98% using three theoretical stages for 92 vol % biodiesel + 8 vol
% Cyanex923 with the initial concentration of 2000 mg/L phenol at
an A/O ratio of 10:1. Biodiesel, used as a diluent, could reduce the
intermolecular hydrogen bond forces in the extractant, which improved
phenol extaction.

It was found that the new solvent selected
in this study, biodiesel,
has the potential to not only improve the phenol extraction ability
but also will pave the way for the application of bioderived solvents
in the solvent extraction.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and Instrument
Kerosene, sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), and 98 wt % sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were
purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Tianjin,
China). Phenol was purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagents
Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Biodiesel was obtained from Guangzhou Fufei
Chemical Corporation (Guangzhou, China). Cyanex923 was purchased from
Shanghai Cytech Company (Shanghai, China). All reagents were of analytical
purity grade and used without any further purification.

Absorbance
was measured using a LebTech-UV-9100 UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Beijing, China). A 98-I-C heating Jacket (China) was used for maintaining
a constant temperature of the aqueous phase and an HD2004W motor stirrer
(Shanghai, China) was used for the phenol extraction. Institute-DRIFT-TENSOR (Germany) was used for infrared
scanning.

Stock Solution Preparation
Phenol (2500 mg/L; pH 7),
10 wt % H2SO4, and 5 M NaOH were prepared by
diluting them with deionized water. The same volume of Cyanex923 was
diluted by kerosene and biodiesel, respectively. The percentage of
extractants is the percentage of volume, for example, 8 vol % Cyanex923
+ 92 vol % biodiesel.

Liquid–Liquid Extraction Experiment
Procedure
At room temperature (298 K), a fixed volume of
phenol was taken into
a separating funnel and a fixed volume of the extractant was added.
The mixture was briefly shaken for 10 min and kept aside for 30 min,
after which the aqueous phase and organic phase got separated. The
aqueous phase was collected, and the residual phenol was measured
on a UV–vis spectrophotometer at 270 nm. Accordingly, the concentration
of phenol in the organic phase was calculated by mass balance. The
reduction in phenol concentration was deduced as eq 4. The distribution ratios could be calculated
from eq 5. Phenol extraction

Determination
of Organic Solvent by Hansen Solubility Parameter
(HSP)
Materials with similar HSP values have high affinity
for each other.22 The solubility of organic
polymer substances can be predicted according to the HSP. The basic
equation governing the assignment of Hansen parameters is that the
total cohesion energy, E, must be the sum of the
individual energies that make it up. 6  where Ed is the
dispersion cohesive energy, Ep is the
polar cohesive energy, and Eh is the electron
exchange parameter.

Dividing this by the molar volume gives
the square of the total (or Hildebrand) solubility parameter as the
sum of the squares of the Hansen D, P, and H components. 7   8  where V is the molar
volume,
δd is the D component of HSP, δp is the P component of HSP, δh is the H component
of HSP, and δ is the total solubility parameter component of
HSP.

The HSP of solvents, solutes, and other organic compounds
can be
calculated using the group contribution method described by Hansen
with the group contribution values collected by Barton23 as follows 9   10   11  Table 3 summarizes
values of the parameters used in eqs 9–11 for some of the most
common organic groups needed to calculate the
HSP by means of the group contribution method. As organic molecules
were mainly based on hydrocarbons, the HSP of the solvent and extractant
can be calculated by the group contribution method. The HSP of the
mixed extractant (ME) can be estimated by the group contribution method
in the following simplified way24 12   13   14  The x (%)
in eqs 12–14 is represented as the volume concentration of the
extractant.
