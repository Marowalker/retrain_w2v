Cellulose
fibrous aerogels have been fabricated by a facile and
aqueous process that disintegrated electrospun cellulose fibers (ECFs)
and reassembled via freezing/freeze-drying with significantly improved
dry resiliency and spontaneous 89% shape recovery from ca. 70% compressive
strain. Owing to the resilient and 200–300 nm wide ECFs, the
cellulose fibrous aerogels exhibited excellent dual dry and wet resiliency
as well as improved pore accessibility. The fibrous cellular walls
interconnect the aerogel pore structure to allow extraordinary liquid
absorption capacity up to 373 g/g, accounting for 95% of the theoretical
absorption capacity. Both highly dry resilient and absorbent properties
of the ECF aerogel are highly advantageous for hydrocarbon/oil contamination
removal and for hydrocarbon/water separation applications. In addition,
the ECF aerogel could be carbonized into carbon aerogel in supercapacitors
for energy storage.

Introduction
Aerogels are ultralightweight
porous materials often fabricated
from inorganic,1−3 synthetic polymeric,4−6 and carbonaceous7−9 precursors by complicated and costly processes. Because of their
super low densites, that is, close to air, aerogels typically suffer
from irreversible deformation or even brittleness when compressed.
Aerogels have also been made from renewable regenerated cellulose
and cellulose derivatives such as cellophane, viscose, and nitrocellulose
as early as 1932.10 Most cellulose aerogels
reported to date are based on dissolution and regeneration of cellulose
that require significant quantities of solvents and chemicals.11−14 A much greener process in fabricating cellulose aerogel was more
recently demonstrated by freezing and freeze-drying of sulfuric acid-hydrolyzed
cellulose nanocrystals15−17 and cellulose nanofibrils produced by enzymatic hydrolysis
and mechanical defibrillation,18 TEMPO
oxidation,19−22 carboxymethylation,23,24 and mechanical (homogenization25−27 or ultrasonication28) processes. Because
the Young’s modulus of cellulose I has been reported in the
range of 138–155 GPa,29−31 which is much higher than the
88–98 GPa29,30 values for regenerated cellulose
II, aerogels constructed from nanocellulose are expected to have better
mechanical properties than those with a regenerated cellulose allomorph.
Indeed, nanocellulose aerogels have shown outstanding cyclic wet compressive
resilience with almost full shape recovery in water within seconds15,25 and to withstand over 80% compression in the dry state while staying
intact.22,32−34 However, dry compression
leads to irreversible deformation of nanocellulose aerogels whose
dry resilience has only been improved by chemical modification with
silane35,36 or incorporation of reduced graphene oxide37 and polypyrrole.38 Dry resilient aerogels from nanocellulose alone have not been reported
to date.

Most recently, aerogels have also been fabricated from
synthetic
fibers generated by electrospinning, a versatile way to produce fine
submicron fibers from polymer solutions or melts,39 including polyacrylonitrile with a tetraethyl orthoslicate
silica precursor in camphene40 or a water/tert-butanol mixture,4 methylacrylate
copolymer in dioxane,41 polyacrylonitrile
with graphene oxide in water,42 and polycaprolactone
in water,43 then frozen and freeze-dried.
These aerogels from electrospun fibers could recover almost completely
from compression in the dry state, and such compression resiliency
was attributed to their large fiber dimensions (a few hundred nm in
width) in general and chemical cross-linking.4,40

Previously, we have developed a versatile and robust process to
generate ultrafine cellulose fibers by electrospinning cellulose acetate
followed by hydrolysis.44 It is thus plausible
to construct more dry resilient cellulose aerogels from these electrospun
cellulose fibers (ECFs). ECFs are considered to be an excellent precursor
to fabricate more dry resilient cellulose aerogels because of their
typically larger diameters in the range of 200–300 nm and yet
being hydrophilic and easily aqueous dispersible, making dispersion
a green process. The abundant surface hydroxyl groups on cellulose
fibers offer vast possibility for surface modification, leading to
facilely tunable surface chemistry and properties.

Results and Discussion
The ECF membrane derived from cellulose acetate and hydrolyzed
back to cellulose appeared white, ultrathin, and paper-like film,
consisting of submicrometer-sized fibers with 262 ± 79 nm average
width (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The ECF membrane was cut into 5 × 5 mm pieces and homogenized
into an aqueous dispersion by high-speed blending (37 000 rpm,
5 min). The fibers in the dispersion remained similar in widths as
original ECF but were significantly shortened to ca. 50–300
μm long and slightly entangled (Figure 1a,b). While the blending shear force reduced
the fiber length by over 10 fold, the aspect ratios of the homogenized
fibers remained high at up to ca. 1000.

wt % from left to right; (d–g) scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of ECF aerogel assembled from 0.4 wt % aq ECF dispersion.

Freezing (−20 °C,
5 h) and then lyophilizing (−50
°C, 24 h) the homogenized aqueous ECF dispersions (0.1–0.6
wt %) produced white aerogels without appreciable dimensional change,
indicating the absence of shrinkage from freezing and freeze-drying
(Figure 1c). These
aqueous dispersion and freezing/freeze-drying processes convert the
planar fibrous web into hierarchical porous structures of large several
hundred micrometer wide cellular networks (Figure 1d,e) with the surrounding fibrous walls containing
several tens of micrometer wide interfiber spacings (Figure 1f,g). The large cellular pores
are hexagonal, shaped by the slow nucleation of ice into large crystals,
1 order of magnitude larger than the interfiber spacings and 3 orders
of magnitude larger than the ECFs. Similar hierarchical porous structures
were observed on all aerogels, although the macropores appeared much
larger and more irregularly shaped on those fabricated from lower
ECF concentrations (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The 200–300 nm wide fibers in all aerogels are similar
to those originally electrospun, again confirming no change in their
lateral dimensions from blending and assembling. On the cellular pore
walls of the ECF aerogel, the fibers overlay on one another, forming
a loose network structure or highly porous walls. Our previous findings
showed that by the same freezing and freeze-drying processes, the
much narrower (1–2 nm) cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) can assemble
into film-like structures without distinction among the individual
CNFs.22 The lacking of interfiber association
for ECF aerogel is partially attributed to the 2 orders magnitude
larger and highly irregular fiber widths and shapes.

With increasing
aq. ECF dispersion concentrations from 0.1 to 0.6
wt %, the ECF aerogel densities increased linearly from 1.1 to 7.0
mg/cm3 and their corresponding porosities decreased linearly
from 99.9 to 99.6% (Figure 2a). Aqueous alkaline hydrolysis converts the amorphous electrospun
cellulose acetate (ECA) into regenerated cellulose structures with
three crystalline peaks at 2θ of 12.1°, 19.8°, and
21.8° (Figure 2b), corresponding to the 1–10, 110, and 020 lattice planes
of cellulose II,47,48 respectively. The assembled ECF
aerogel had a similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum as the precursor
ECF membrane, showing the same cellulose structure. The crystallinity
index (CrI) was 71.6 and 69.3% for ECF membrane and aerogel, respectively.
The slightly lowered crystallinity of the aerogel could be ascribed
to mechanical agitation. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) nitrogen adsorption isotherm showed nearly reversible adsorption
and desorption loops without leveling off at a high relative pressure
(Figure 2c), which
is typical of type II adsorption isotherms of nonporous and macroporous
structures. The pore size distribution curve showed a broad distribution
of meso- and macropores ranging from 20 to 90 nm (Figure 2d), further corroborating the
smaller interfiber pores on the cellular walls surrounding the macroscopic
cellular pores previously observed by SEM. The specific surface and
pore volume of cellulose fiber aerogel are 7.9 m2/g and
0.016 cm3/g, respectively, which are close to the respective
7.6 m2/g and 0.015 cm3/g values of the original
electrospun cellulose membrane (Figure S3, Supporting Information), as expected. It should be noted that the pore
volume determined by the BET measurement involves the micro-/mesopores
and has little effect on the liquid absorption capacity discussed
below. The fibers in the aerogels are essentially isolated from each
other, similar to the electrospun membrane, but bimodally distributed
spatially in the more highly concentrated fibrous walls and much more
separated from each other by large hundreds of micrometer size spaces
generated by large ice crystals from slow freezing. As noted earlier,
the regenerated cellulose ECFs do not exhibit the ability to self-assemble
into the contact film as CNFs, a distinction attributed to the Cellulose
II structure of ECFs as opposed to the CNF Cellulose I structure as
well as the 2 orders of magnitude lower specific surface for interfiber
association of the much wider ECF than CNFs, that is, ca. 200 nm versus
2 nm, respectively.

and (d) pore size distribution. The ECF aerogel used in XRD and BET
measurement was assembled from the 0.5 wt % concentration.

The ECF aerogels remained intact and were highly
stable in organic
liquids, showing very high absorption capacities toward organic liquids,
as demonstrated by the 201–373 g/g of chloroform absorption
that increased with decreasing aerogel densities (Figure 3a). The 373 g/g of absorption
capacity (or 250 mL/g when normalized by chloroform density) is far
higher than most of the aerogels reported to date, including those
from natural polymers such as chitin (29–58 g/g),49 ethyl cellulose (32–64 g/g),50 gelatin (70–123 g/g),51 bacterial cellulose (86–185 g/g),52 microfibrillated cellulose (88–228 g/g),36 and cellulose ester (112 g/g)53 aerogels, synthetic polymers such as melamine (38–217
g/g),54−56 poly(vinyl alcohol) (10–274 g/g),35,57,58 and polystyrene (100–270
g/g),59 carbonized natural polymers such
as glucose nanofibers (40–115 g/g),8 bacterial cellulose (106–312 g/g),60 cotton (50–192 g/g),61 poplar
catkins (80–161 g/g),62 waste paper
(33–70 g/g),63 and kapok fiber (147–292
g/g)64-based aerogels, and most of graphitic
carbon such as carbon nanotubes (80–180 g/g)65 and graphene (134–283 g/g)66 (Table 1). Few aerogels
with higher absorption capacity have been reported with graphene oxide/carbon
nanotubes (215–913 g/g),7 graphene
framework (200–600 g/g),67 and reduced
graphene oxide/bacterial cellulose carbon aerogel (393–1002
g/g),68 all containing energy-intensively
produced graphene and carbon nanotubes, which inevitably increase
the production cost of the absorbents. Other than these few graphene-based
aerogels, the reported ECF aerogel demonstrates the highest absorption
capacity among all polymeric and carbonized natural polymer-based
aerogels. Carbonization of natural polymers (mostly cellulose) has
also the drawback of losing significant material, that is, 49.4% of
cellulose (C6H10O5)n is O.

On the basis of the theoretical
absorption capacity calculated
from the density of aerogel, the actual chloroform absorption showed
that over 95% of the pores within the 7 mg/cm3 density
aerogel was filled. This nearly complete accessibility of this ECF
aerogel to chloroform is much higher than the 70% for CNF aerogel
with a slightly higher density of 8.1 mg/cm3 (Figure 3b). This significantly
higher pore accessibility of the ECF aerogel by liquids was beneficial
for the higher overall liquid absorption. The nearly full pore accessibility
could be ascribed to the hierarchical pore structures of the ECF aerogels,
with hundreds of micrometer wide large pores holding the absorbed
liquid and the numerous tens of micrometer wide small pores on the
cell walls allowing liquid to be transported across the large pores.
While the lack of interfiber association benefits organic liquid accessibility
among the hierarchical pore structure in ECF aerogels, this and the
lack of interfiber entanglement cause ready redispersion in water
by gentle hand shaking into individual fibers (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Therefore, ECF aerogels
could not retain the porous structures in water to be used for aqueous
applications. This poor aqueous integrity of ECF aerogels is in distinct
contrast to the wet resilient CNF aerogels, which could withstand
over 100 compression–recovery cycles because of the strong
interfibril association.22

In essence,
the physical properties of these cellulose aerogels
depend highly on the dimension of the nanofiber precursors as well
as their crystalline structures, with the larger ECFs forming a open
porous cellular structure with higher pore accessibilities but less
aqueous stability, whereas the 3 orders of magnitude smaller CNFs
self-assembled via strong interfibril association to achieve excellent
aqueous stability, with the sacrifice of interpore accessibility.

All ECF aerogels remained intact when compressed at up to 0.8 strain
in air (Figure 4a).
These dry compressive stress–strain curves showed impressive
ductile and flexible properties attributed to the large fiber sizes
and the flexibility of ECF. Three distinct stages could be observed
from the stress–strain curves, that is, the initial linear
elastic regions at low strain (<0.05), followed by a nonlinear
plastic deformation region once passing the yield stress, and the
last densification stage at high strain. As expected, both the Young’s
modulus and ultimate stress increased with increasing aerogel densities,
reaching 20.1 and 8.1 kPa, respectively, for the 0.6 ECF aerogel (Table
S1, Supporting Information), respectively.
While compressive stress–strain curves were similar in shape
to cellulose nanofibrils aerogels,18,22 these respective
compression modulus and stress are less than half and one-third as
compared to the CNF aerogels with similar density (54.5 and 25.3 kPa
for Young’s modulus and ultimate stress, respectively).22 The significantly lower mechanical properties
of the ECF aerogel can be attributed to the absence of interfiber
association observed and discussed earlier as well as the weaker regenerated
cellulose II crystalline structure as compared to the native cellulose
Iβ crystalline structure of the CNF aerogels.

Figure 4 Mechanical performance
of ECF aerogels: (a) compressive stress–strain
curves; compression–recovery of aerogel with 4.2 mg/cm3 density (from 0.4 wt % aq ECF dispersion): (b) digital images
of under 2 (56.7 g) and 4 oz (113.4 g) weights; (c) compressive stress–strain
hysteresis at 0.4 strain; and (d) recovery from compression under
4 oz weight.

Despite the lower compressive
modulus and stress than the CNF aerogels,
the ECF aerogel is sufficiently strong to withstand external forces,
as demonstrated by a lack of appreciable deformation of a 25.2 mg
aerogel under a 2 oz (56.7 g) weight, that is, 2250 times of its own
mass (Figure 4b). Even
under 4500 times of own mass or 4 oz (113.4 g) weight that significantly
deforms ECF to ca. 70% in height, it still can recover to over 80%
of its original shape upon releasing the load. The compression–recovery
was further demonstrated by repetitively compressing the aerogel from
the 0.4 wt % ECF concentration (density of 4.2 mg/cm3),
showing immediate recovery upon releasing the stress (Video S1, Supporting Information). The compressive stress–strain
curves of the same aerogel at up to 0.4 strain showed gradual decrease
in compressive stress upon releasing the load (Figure 4c), with a positive stress value at strain
above 0.12, which demonstrates the recovery behavior of the aerogel
upon releasing the compressive force. The large hysteresis between
the loading and unloading curves indicates energy dissipation due
to yielding. All ECF aerogels with densities above 2.2 mg/cm3, that is, from ≥0.2 wt % ECF concentrations, could recover
83 to 89% when compressed by 113.4 g (4 oz) weight (Figure 4d). The relative lower 59%
recovery for the aerogel from the 0.1 wt % concentration is due to
its lower 1.1 mg/cm3 density and weaker structure.

To retain aerogel integrity under an aqueous environment and enable
selective oil removal from aqueous media, the aerogel was made hydrophobic
by facile vapor deposition of methyltrichlorosilane, converting the
hydrophilic surface hydroxyl groups to hydrophobic methyl groups.
Successful silanization was confirmed from the presence of 5.5 at.
% silicon by energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) spectra (Figure 5a), showing uniform
coverage on fiber surfaces from Si mapping (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The acquired hydrophobicity
was clearly shown by water beading up on the aerogel surface with
a large contact angle as well as aerogel floating on the water surface
without sinking or disintegration (Figure 5b). The silanized aerogel remained stable
in water, in contrast to the complete disintegration of the untreated
original.

Figure 5 Characterization of silanized ECF aerogels (from 0.4 wt % aq ECF
dispersion): (a) EDS spectra with atomic concentration for C, O, and
Si; (b) digital images of water beads on aerogel and aerogel floating

visual contrast); (c) mass- (g/g) and (d) volume (mL/g)-based adsorption
capacity toward varied organic liquids, with dash lines representing

before (left), during (middle), and after (right) compression; and
(f) cyclic absorption of toluene during 10 cycles of absorption-squeezing.

The silanized ECF aerogel absorbed
119 to 284 g/g (or 171 to 191
mL/g) of nonpolar organic liquids, including aliphatic (hexane and
decane), chlorinated (chloroform), cyclic (cyclohexane), and aromatic
(toluene and xylene) hydrocarbons and oil (pump), corresponding to
86–96% of the theoretical absorption capacity (Figure 5c,d). These impressive absorption
capacities are much higher than the 76% of the same nonpolar organic
liquids absorbed by CNF aerogel,22 again
showing significantly improved pore accessibility. The absorption
capacity is slightly lower for the polar dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
at 150 mL/g or 75% of the theoretical values but still higher than
the 64% for CNF aerogels toward the same solvent.

Besides, the
silanized ECF aerogel showed excellent flexibility
and resilience in organic liquids, as demonstrated by full shape recovery
when compressed and then released while immersed in toluene (Figure 5e). This superior
wet resilience in organic liquids makes recovering of the oil absorbed
easy, by simple squeezing and recycling, permitting reusing of the
aerogel for absorbing the same or even a different liquid. It showed
that a toluene-saturated aerogel could be squeezed to remove ∼80%
of the absorbed (with ∼30 g/g remaining), then still retain
over 67% of its original absorption capacity in 10 repetitive absorption-squeezing
cycles (Figure 5f).
Therefore, these ECF aerogels have shown to be excellent candidates
for repetitive oil removal from aqueous media. The oil recovery by
mechanical force is simple and less energy-intensive than distillation
of the same from the CNF aerogel.22

To further demonstrate the ability of silane-modified ECF aerogel
in oil–water separation, complete removal of oil contamination
from water was shown by selectively absorbing either chloroform underneath
the water by being forced under water without absorbing it along the
way (Figure 6a, Video
S2, Supporting Information) or toluene
floating on the water surface (Figure 6b, Video S3, Supporting Information). In essence, the ECF aerogels exhibited super high liquid absorbency,
showing nearly full pore accessibility, and excellent dry and wet
resiliency, validating its application in oily contamination removal
as well as recyclability.

ECF aerogel

(a) chloroform at the bottom and (b) toluene on the top of water;

Besides environmental remediation,
the ECF aerogel also showed
promising aspect in energy storage application, as demonstrated by
using the carbonized ECF (C-ECF) aerogel as the electrode materials
in a supercapacitor. C-ECF aerogel was obtained by heating the unmodified
ECF aerogel at 10 °C/min to 800 °C and maintained at 800
°C for 30 min under a N2 atmosphere. The C-ECF aerogel
showed significant mass and volume reduction of 94.7 and 96.9%, respectively,
but an intact structure. Carbonization turns the white cellulose aerogel
into black carbon aerogel, with the atomic concentration of 97.1 and
2.9% for C and O, respectively. SEM images of the carbon aerogel also
showed a 3D porous structure with pores of 20–100 μm,
which is significantly lower than the several hundreds of microns
sized pores in the original aerogels (Figure 7a,b. The fiber diameter also reduced from
the original average 262 nm to around 100 nm width (Figure 7c). The carbon aerogel was
tested for its performance in the supercapacitor by characterizing
the binder and conductive additive-free C-ECF electrodes in 6 M KOH
in symmetric coin cells. The cell voltage was set to be 1 V because
of the limited electrochemical window of the aqueous electrolyte.
Cyclic voltammogram was obtained and exhibited a rather rectangular
shape, as shown in Figure 7d, which indicated a good capacitive energy storage behavior.70 On the basis of the Nyquist plot at 1 kHz in Figure 7e, the equivalent
series resistance (ESR) was determined to be 4.2 Ω, which is
comparable to the ESR of 3.271 and 4.6
Ω72 for graphene-based supercapacitors
reported previously, implying good conductive behavior, less internal
energy loss, and better power performance. According to the evaluation
methods reported by Zhang and Pan,70 the
specific capacitance of the C-ECF electrode was calculated to be 103
F/g and 51.3 mF/cm2 based on the constant current charge/discharge
curves shown in Figure 7f. The specific capacitance of 103 F/g was significantly larger (>2×)
than the previously reported specific capacitance of 35–F/g
for unactivated carbon aerogel-based supercapacitors with KOH electrolytes73−75 and comparable to that of carbon nanotube-based supercapacitors.76−78 In addition, the triangular charge/discharge behavior supported
the good capacitive energy storage behavior demonstrated in Figure 7f. Therefore, the
3D ECF aerogel demonstrates great promise for energy storage applications.

Conclusions
Ultralightweight (density as low as 1.1 mg/cm3) and
highly porous (up to 99.9% porosity) cellulose II aerogels were facilely
fabricated by disintegrating ECFs by high-speed blending followed
by freezing/freeze-drying in all aqueous-based homogenization and drying processes.
The ECF aerogels demonstrated excellent dry resiliency, showing up
to 89% shape recovery from high-strain compression (∼70% strain).
The ECF aerogel contains hierarchical porous structures of large hundreds
of micrometer wide cellular porous networks surrounded by fibrous
cell walls with small tens of micron wide pores, contributing to superior
liquid absorption capacity and pore accessibility for liquid absorption,
respectively. The ECF aerogels could absorb 201–373 g/g of
chloroform, accounting for over 95% of the theoretical absorption
capacity. Furthermore, the ECF aerogels could be facilely modified
to be hydrophobic and stable in an aqueous environment by vapor phase
silanization with methyltrichlorosilane and to be capable of selectively
and repetitively removing nonpolar liquids (as demonstrated with chloroform
and toluene) from aqueous media. The silanized ECF aerogel showed
excellent shape recovery from compressing in toluene, maintaining
over 67% of original absorption capacity after 10 repetitive absorption-squeezing
cycles. This high absorption capacity and selectivity, as well as
reusability, make these cellulose II aerogels excellent candidates
for removing hydrocarbon/oily contamination from aqueous media and
hydrocarbon/oil–water separation applications. A supercapacitor
based on the CNF aerogel showed a very low ESR of 4.2 Ω and
a high areal capacitance of 51.3 mF/cm2. In essence, the
ECF aerogel exhibited promising performance in both environmental
remediation and energy storage, which could be further extended to
more applications such as insulating materials, biomedical scaffolds,
as well as electrochemical sensors.

h.44 Methyltrichlorosilane (99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
methylene blue (Certified biological stain, Fisher Scientific), hexane
(Certified ACS, Fisher Scientific), decane (Certified, Fisher Scientific),
cyclohexane (HPLC grade, EM Science), acetone (Histological grade,
Fisher Scientific), xylene (GR ACS, EM Science), toluene (Certified
ACS, Fisher Scientific), pump oil (Maxima C Plus, Fisher Scientific),
DMSO (GR, EMD), and chloroform (Certified ACS, Fisher Scientific)
were used as received without further purification. All water used
was purified using a Milli-Q plus water purification system (Millipore
Corporate, Billerica, MA).

Fabrication of ECF Aerogel
The electrospun
cellulose
membrane was cut into 5 × 5 mm pieces and then dispersed in water
by high-speed blending (37 000 rpm, 5 min) into short fibers.
ECF aerogel was fabricated from freezing (−20 °C, 5 h)
0.1–0.6 wt % aqueous dispersions of short ECF and then lyophilizing
(−50 °C, 24 h) in a freeze-drier (FreeZone 1.0L Benchtop
Freeze Dry System, Labconco, Kansas City, MO). The ECF aerogel made
from 0.4 wt % cellulose fiber suspension was modified by vapor deposition
of methyltrichlorosilane at 85 °C for 30 min in a vacuum oven.

Characterization of ECF Aerogel
The density (ρa) of ECF aerogel was calculated from its mass divided by the
volume, and porosity of the aerogel was calculated as 1  where ρc is the
density of
cellulose taken as 1.6 g cm–3.45

Liquid absorption capacity was determined by immersing
the aerogel into each selected liquid until complete saturation. The
absorption capacity (g/g) was calculated as 2  where ws and w0 are weights of fully saturated
and dry aerogel,
respectively.

The ECF aerogel was sputter-coated with gold and
imaged by a field-emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (XL 30-SFEG, FEI/Philips, USA)
at a 5 mm working distance and a 5 kV accelerating voltage. Elemental
analysis of organosilane-modified ECF aerogel was conducted using
EDS (EDAX, AMETEK, Inc.) attached on the FESEM. The samples were scanned
at a 1000 magnification with a 5 kV accelerating voltage and a 5 mm
working distance. The specific surface area and pore characteristics
of ECF aerogel were determined by N2 adsorption at 77 K
by a surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP 2000, Micromeritics,
USA). The sample was degassed at 35 °C to below 16 mmHg. The
specific surface was determined by the BET method from the linear
region of the isotherms in the 0.06–0.20 relative P/P0 pressure range. Pore size distributions
were derived from the desorption branch of the isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. XRD spectra for the ECF aerogel were collected on a Scintag
XDS 2000 powder diffractometer using a Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å) at an anode voltage of 45 kV and a current
of 40 mA. Diffractograms were recorded from 5° to 40° at
a scan rate of 2°/min.

The CrI was estimated using the
Segal equation46 3  where I020 is
the peak intensity of the 020 lattice plane located as 21.8°
2θ, and Iam is the intensity attributed
to amorphous cellulose at 16° 2θ for cellulose II. Compressive
tests were performed on 10 mm long cylindrical ECF aerogel using Instron
5566 equipped with a 2.5 N load cell and two flat-surface compression
stages. The loading and unloading compressive rates were set to the
same constant 1 mm/min.

Construction and Electrochemical Characterization
of an ECF
Aerogel-Based Supercapacitor
The ECF aerogel fabricated from
0.6 wt % cellulose nanofiber suspension was carbonized by heating
at 10 °C/min to 800 °C and maintained at 800 °C for
30 min under a N2 atmosphere, which was used for supercapacitor
application. The C-ECF aerogel was used to prepare the supercapacitor
electrode by applying ca. 1 mg of the material directly to 1 cm2 nickel foam without a binder and conductive additive then
roller-pressed to 50 μm thickness to improve the contact between
C-ECF and nickel foam. Symmetric supercapacitor coin cells were constructed
using two identical electrodes with cellulose filter paper as the
separator and sealed with a manual crimper (CR2032, MTI). A 6 M KOH
aqueous suspension was used as electrolytes.

The electrochemical
properties of C-ECF supercapacitors were analyzed through cyclic voltammetry
on a potentiostat/galvanostat (EG&G Princeton Applied Research,
model 263A), galvanostatic charge/discharge on an eight channel battery
analyzer (MTI Corporation, mode BST8-MA), and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy on a frequency response detector connected with the EG&G
263A with the frequency from 100 kHz to 10 mHz at room temperature.
