Two simple biphenyl-appended (2-pyridyl)alkylamine N-bidentate ligands, Le and Lm, having
ethylene
and methylene spacers between donor groups, with bite angles Le ≈ 100° and Lm ≈ 80°, dictate
pseudotetrahedral and trigonal-bipyramidal geometries in six high-spin
Ni(II)-halide complexes, [Ni(Le)X2] and [Ni(Lm)2X](ClO4) (where X = Cl–, Br–, I–), respectively. The
structures in the solid state, determined using X-ray crystallography,

Introduction
There is growing interest
directed toward the modification of classical N-bidentate
ligands, α-diimine (2,2′-bipyridine,
1,10-phenanthroline), β-diketiminate, diamine, and (2-pyridyl)alkylamines
to tune the steric and electronic properties to achieve novel and
reactive transition metal complexes.1 Low-coordinate
(≤4) mononuclear nickel compounds with such N-bidentate ligands have attracted a great deal of recent interest
in the field of bioinorganic chemistry, including activation of small
molecules (O2, N2, N2O, NO), oxygenation
catalysis, olefin polymerization, electro- and photo-catalytic hydrogen
production, and other areas of applications.2−4 Four-coordinate
tetrahedral Ni(II)-halide complexes of sterically hindered pyridyl-imine
ligands serve as alternative catalysts for traditional Ziegler–Natta
polymerization of ethylene and α-olefins.5 Similarly, the tetrahedral Ni(II)-halide complex [Ni(bc)Cl2] (bc = 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) functions
as a photocatalyst for production of hydrogen in aqueous medium.6 The classical five-coordinate Ni(II) complex,
[Ni(Me6tren)Cl](ClO4), with magnetic anisotropy
has drawn recent attention as a potential single-molecule magnet.7

Strangely, there are a limited number of
four- and five-coordinate
high-spin mononuclear Ni(II)-halide complexes with unhindered N-bidentate ligands, exhibiting tetrahedral (td) and trigonal-bipyramidal
(tbp) geometries.8 This is due to the plasticity
of Ni(II) coordination for a range of geometries: tetrahedral, square-planar,
square-pyramidal, trigonal-bipyramidal, and octahedral, which has
been elegantly demonstrated recently using a chelating hemilabile
P,S-bidentate ligand.9 On the other hand,
the use of soft donor bidentate diphosphine or hybrid P,N-ligands
with methylene and ethylene spacers give low-spin square-planar Ni(II)-dichloride
complexes.10 Even the N-bidentate dihydrobis(pyrazolyl)borates with bulky substituents on
the ring give square-planar and occasionally octahedral geometries.11 The most common N-bidentate
ligands, like bpy, phen, and diamine (L), typically generate tris-chelated
[NiL3]2+ hexacoordinate high-spin complexes,12 and in solution, a dynamic equilibrium of species
with different metal to ligand ratios exist.9b Even well-established versatile tridentate ligands, like triazacylononane
(tacn), hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate anion (Tp–),
and tetradentate tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (tmpa), likewise give
an octahedral geometry.13 A few tripodal
tetra-amine (tren) and tris(2-aminophenyl)amine derivatives with alkyl,
aryl, amide, and urea substituents stabilize the Ni(II)-halides in
the tbp geometry.7,14 On the other hand, bis(imino)pyridine
and terpyridine ligands mostly give square-pyramidal geometry.15 The modified bpy and phen ligands with bulky
aryl/alkyl groups adjacent to N-donor atoms or alkylated diamines
stabilize Ni(II)-dihalide in the tetrahedral geometry,1f,16 and less sterically hindered bidentate ligands often give halide-bridged
binuclear Ni(II) complexes. However, the syntheses of such ligands
with bulky substituents are sometimes challenging, either requiring
expensive reagents or involving multiple steps. In addition, it has
been shown that the bite angle of such rigid (bpy, phen) ligands remains
unchanged (∼81°) and the stabilization of tetrahedral
geometry is due to steric protection.1f

It is clear from the above survey that the structure and coordination
geometries of Ni(II)-halide complexes are influenced by the nature
of the ligand, that is, donor atom type, chelate ring size, and the
steric bulk. However, control of their structures and coordination
geometries by altering the bite angles of bidentate ligands has not
been recognized before. The vital roles of bite angles in regulating
several physical and chemical properties of transition metal complexes
have been documented.17 The influence of
wide bite angle (120°) bidentate diphosphine ligands in hydroformylation
of olefins using rhodium catalyst to give stereoselective linear aldehydes
has been well established, wherein they stabilize reaction intermediates
in trigonal bipyramidal geometry.18 Similarly,
subtle changes in the bite angles of N-bidentate
ligands influencing the spin-crossover (high-spin ↔ low-spin)
transition of tris-chelated-iron complexes have been explained.17

Interestingly, the use of simple N-substituted
(2-pyridyl)alkylamine
ligands with different alkyl spacers to stabilize different coordinate
geometries of nickel(II) complexes is scarce,9,19 even
though they can offer a handle to alter the bite angles. We have employed
two such simple biphenyl-appended (2-pyridyl)alkylamine N,N′-bidentate ligands having either ethyl
or methyl alkyl spacers and shown how they regulate two different
coordination geometries of Ni(II). The new ligands are easy to synthesize
in one step and in high yields using readily available (2-pyridyl)alkylamines
and 2,2′-bis(bromomethyl)-1,1′-biphenyl.20 We have previously shown using one of the ligands
(Lm, Scheme 1) with copper compounds to give unusual structures and reactivity
toward dioxygen and phosphodiester substrate.21

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route to Tetra- and Penta-Coordinate Ni(II)-Halide Complexes
Dictated by the N-Bidentate Ligand Bite Angles
Herein, we describe the syntheses
and characterization of six mononuclear
high-spin Ni(II)-halide complexes, [Ni(Le)X2] and [Ni(Lm)2X](ClO4) (X = Cl–, Br–, I–), in
tetrahedral and trigonal-bipyramidal geometries, regulated by the
bite angles of new N,N′-bidentate
ligands, Le and Lm, having ethylene (CH2CH2) or methylene (CH2) spacers between
the two donor groups (Scheme 1). The work presented here represents a rare example of controlling
the coordination geometries of Ni(II) by merely altering the chelate
bite angles of simple N-bidentate ligands. The structural
characterizations of all of the high-spin Ni(II) complexes in the
solid state by single crystal X-ray diffraction and in solution by
spectroscopic (UV–vis–NIR, ESI-MS, and paramagnetic 1H NMR) methods are described.

Results and Discussion
Treatment of the N,N′-bidentate
ligand, Le, with anhydrous nickel(II)-halide salts, NiX2 (X = Cl–, Br–, I–) in equimolar ratios in toluene at 50 °C for
2 h provided bluish-violet to brownish-green crystalline solids, [Ni(Le)X2] (where X = Cl–, Br–, I–, 1a–c) in
good yield (70%). They were also prepared in tetrahydrofuran, CH3CN, or methanol using hydrated Ni-halide salts or Ni-perchlorate
in the presence of a halide source, like n-Bu4NX or NaX (X = Cl, Br, I). However, the yields were relatively
lower because of their partial solubility in these solvents. These
complexes were stable to air in the solid state and solution and soluble
in chlorinated polar solvents. Efforts to prepare 1:2 Ni/Le complexes were unsuccessful, in spite of using more than 2 equiv
of ligand, clearly demonstrating the preference of ligand, Le, for four-coordinate complexes. Contrastingly, the reaction of Lm with hydrated Ni(II)-halide salts NiX2·xH2O (X = Cl–, Br–, I–) in 1:2 molar ratio in methanol at room temperature,
followed by the metathesis reaction with NaClO4·H2O readily precipitated highly crystalline apple-green to yellow-green
solids, [Ni(Lm)2X](ClO4) (X = Cl–, Br–, I–, 2a–c) in good yield (70–75%). Like
before, an attempt to prepare the 1:1 4-coordinate complex, [Ni(Lm)Cl2] was unsuccessful, which emphasizes the preference
of Lm to stabilize five-coordinate complexes.

The
molecular structures of all of the six Ni(II) complexes were
determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and as a representative
example, the results of 1a and 2a are shown
in Figure 1. The comparable
structures of 1b–c and 2b–c are shown in Figure S1, with selected bond lengths and angles listed in Table 1. The molecules 1a–c are neutral four-coordinate mononuclear Ni(II)
with pseudo-tetrahedral geometry, and the metal is chelated by the N-bidentate ligand, Le, and two terminal halide
ions. The distortion in the geometry is based on the τ4 criterion,22 0.87 for 1a–b and 0.97 for 1c.

Interestingly, the opening of the
X1–Ni–X2 angles
[130.74(2), 129.00(2), 115.53(2)°] compared to that in a regular
tetrahedron is accompanied by closing of the ligand N–Ni–N
bite angles [100.14(6), 100.73(8), 97.04(12)°] in 1a–c, respectively. This is not unusual as a similar
pattern has been observed with related complexes containing bis-guanidine
and other hindered bidentate ligands.23 It is important to point out that the ligand (Le) N–Ni–N
bite angle, ≈ 100°(av), is much wider than that observed
(91°) for complexes containing propane-diamine,17 which also form a six-membered ring, chelate, like in Le. The wide bite angle (>90°) bidentate diamines or
(2-pyridyl)alkylamines
are rare.24 The widening of the angle in
the present case is due to the combined effect of both the ethyl spacer
and sterically hindered biphenyl group. A similar example is apparent
from careful analysis of a recent report on the Ni(II)-bromide complex
of the N-substituted 2-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine bidentate ligand having
a hindered diethyl group, which offers a wide bite angle (97°)
and stabilizes the four-coordinate tetrahedral geometry.25

The Ni–Nam bond is longer
than Ni–Npy as expected; this is due to the bulky
biphenyl group on
the amine nitrogen, which makes Nam a weaker σ-donor.
The coordination geometry and bond parameters of Ni(II) in 1a–c are comparable to those of related structures.6,16b,23 Furthermore, the molecules in
the crystal lattice are stabilized by several strong noncovalent intermolecular
interactions (Figure S2, Table S2), such
as hydrogen bonding (C–H···Cl, 2.85 Å,
150.8°), π–π stacking (3.2 Å, py···py,
face-to-face, interplanar; 3.17 Å, py···ph, face-to-side,
tilted 24°), and C–H···π (2.74 Å,
CH2···ph, 141°) giving them extra stability.

On the other hand, the five-coordinate Ni(II) complexes, 2a–c, adopt a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal
geometry (Figure 1, 2a), ligated by two ligand molecules, Lm, providing
tetra-N coordination plus a chloride (halide) ion completes the pentacoordination.
The equatorial plane is made of two tertiary amine-nitrogen atoms
having a bulky biphenyl append and a chloride (halide) ion. The axial
positions are occupied by the nitrogen atoms of two pyridyl rings,
which are nearly orthogonal, with dihedral angles (ϕ) varying
between 75.1 and 77.40° for 2a–c (Table 1). The metal
atom sits almost in the trigonal plane of N1N3Cl1 atoms, and the sum of the trigonal angles is 360°.
However, the geometry about the metal is distorted because of the
acute ligand N–Ni–N bite angles (∼80° av)
and hence the axial and equatorial angles deviate from the ideal,
180 and 120°, by 9°. According to the τ5 (0.76) criterion,26 the pentagonal coordination
for Ni(II) is identified as distorted tbp. The geometry and coordination
bond parameters of 2a–c are comparable
to those of other related Ni(II) complexes containing tripodal tetra-amine-derivatives.7,14 A similar example of 5-coordinate Ni(II) with tbp geometry has been
recently reported with the N-substituted (2-pyridyl)methylamine ligand
having a bulky (2,6-dimethyl)phenyl group.24b It re-emphasizes the role of biphenyl append in the stabilization
of such an uncommon tbp geometry with Ni(II). Furthermore, strong
intermolecular hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking
interactions, like those in 1a–c,
are also observed (Figure S3).

The
structures of 1a–c and 2a–c in solution, characterized by spectroscopic
(UV–vis–NIR, 1H NMR, ESI-MS) methods and
magnetic susceptibility measurements in solution (CD2Cl2 or CDCl3) by Evans NMR method,27 agree well with the structures observed in the solid state.
The moments of 1a–c in solution with
μeff ∼3.15 B.M. are consistent with those
of Ni(II) (S = 1) in tetrahedral geometry. Also, the moment of solid 1c (Figure S4), with a χMT value of 1.1 emu mol–1 K (μeff = 3.0 B.M.) at 298 K, agrees with that
measured in solution. The moment values, μeff 3.11,
3.47, and 3.28 B.M. for 2a–c, respectively,
are slightly greater than the spin-only value due to the spin–orbit
coupling contribution. The ESI-MS spectra of complexes 2a–c show molecular-ion peaks at m/z, 667, 711, and 757, respectively, corresponding
to [M – ClO4]+, and the observed and
calculated isotopic patterns are consistent with the expected composition
(Figure S5).

The electronic absorption
spectra of Ni(II) complexes in solution
are characteristic of their distorted-tetrahedral and tbp geometries.
The spectra of 1a–c and 2a–c were measured in CH2Cl2, and as a representative example, the spectra of [Ni(Le)Br2], 1b, and [Ni(Lm)2Br](ClO4), 2b are shown in Figure 2, and the comparable spectra
of the remaining complexes are shown in Figure S6. The spectrum of 1b exhibits five bands in
the visible–NIR region. Both the profile and features are typical
of Ni(II) in a pseudotetrahedral geometry and comparable to those
of [Ni(TpMe2)(Br)] (where TpMe2 = hydrotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazole)borate)
having a similar geometry.28 The spectrum
of 1c with two iodides is slightly different in the visible
region due to a slight deviation in the coordination geometry. The
spectra of complexes with tbp geometry 2b (Figure 2, 2b) and 2a,c (Figure S7) show
three well-defined bands and a shoulder at 470 nm; besides, charge
transfer bands are also observed for 2b–c in the UV-region. These features are characteristic of Ni(II)-halide
complexes in the tbp geometry and compare well with other complexes
containing tripodal tetra-amine ligands.29 Furthermore, the relative shift in the absorption wavelength position
among 1a–c and 2a–c is in accordance with the spectrochemical series Cl <
Br < I.

Figure 2 Electronic absorption spectra of 1b and 2b in CH2Cl2.

The geometries of Ni(II) complexes in solution were easily
identified
by proton NMR spectroscopy.30 Their paramagnetic
spectra differ significantly from the corresponding diamagnetic molecules.
The spectra of six-coordinate Ni(II) compounds are normally broader,
whereas those for tetrahedral and trigonal-bipyramidal complexes are
sharper and shifted over a wide spectral window.13c,31 The 1H NMR spectra of all six complexes, 1a–c and 2a–c,
were either measured in CD2Cl2 or CDCl3. As a representative example, the spectra of 1b and 2b are shown in Figure 3, and the rest are shown in Figures S8 and S9. The spectrum of 1b possesses seven hyperfine-shifted
resonances due to the ligand (Le) protons: one upfield
shifted (−26.6 ppm), five downfield, and a broad signal in
the diamagnetic region. We assume that the isotropic shifts in all
of the resonances are dominated by Fermi-contact (σ-delocalization),
and the pseudocontact contribution is negligible. Signals were assigned
on the basis of chemical shifts, integral ratio, peak widths (ν1/2), proximity of protons to the metal center (Ni···H
distances from the X-ray structure of 1b), and comparison
with related examples from the literature.32 The resonance at −26.6 ppm is assigned to the methylene pair
bound to the pyridine ring (H2), as it is common to observe this pair
in the upfield region.33 The other methylene
pair (H1) appears at 194 ppm, and the two methylene pairs attached
to the biphenyl ring (H7) may also have overlapped with it.34 The remaining sharp signals at 228, 61, 53,
and 31 ppm are typical of pyridine ring protons and assigned to H6,
H5, H3, and H4, respectively. The biphenyl protons (H8) appear in
the diamagnetic region, as they are too far away from the paramagnetic
Ni(II) center. The spectra for the chloro and iodo derivatives, 1a and 1c, show a slight variation, but otherwise,
the pattern remains the same. The spectral features of these complexes
are comparable to those of other related tetrahedral Ni(II) complexes
containing pyridine-type ligands.32 On
the other hand, the spectrum of 2b, with a tbp geometry,
shows higher contact shifts (+341 to −14 ppm) as a result of
larger magnetic anisotropy due to the small bite angle of two chelated
ligand molecules (Lm).31b The
two pyridine rings are equivalent, whereas the methylene groups are
not. A few signals in the upfield region indicate a smaller magnetic
anisotropy or a slight contribution of the pseudocontact shift. Assignment
of pyridine signals was made as before; however, those due to methylene
were uncertain. The NMR features can be compared with other related
examples.15,35

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the syntheses of
six new high-spin
Ni(II)-halide complexes in tetrahedral and trigonal-bipyramidal geometries,
regulated by the bite angles of two simple biphenyl-appended (2-pyridyl)alkylamine N,N′-bidentate ligands having ethylene
and methylene spacers. All of the complexes, 1a–c and 2a–c, were characterized
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The electronic absorption and
paramagnetic proton NMR spectra in solution complemented the solid-state
structures. These findings demonstrate the potential of this and related
systems21 to affect the metal coordination
geometry and reactivity through simple ligand modifications. These
complexes may have potential applications in the polymerization of
olefins, similar to Brookhart catalysts,5 and could even stabilize Ni(I) with phosphines as coligands and
provide a pathway for hydride complexes, which may function as organometallic
catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.36

Experimental Section
All reactants were of reagent grade
and used without further purification
unless stated otherwise. Solvents were of HPLC quality and were freshly
distilled under nitrogen before use. Dichloromethane was distilled
by a standard procedure and, further, from calcium hydride. Toluene
was distilled over sodium. Ethanol was purchased from Hayman and used
as received. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded either on
Shimadzu UV–vis 3100 or Jasco 650 spectrophotometers, and IR
spectra were recorded on a Jasco 650 using the KBr pellet method.
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were
recorded using Bruker Avance 400 and 500 spectrometers, and ESI-MS
spectra were obtained in acetonitrile on a Q-TOF-Mass microhybrid
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The vibrating sample
magnetometer measurements were carried out on a Lakeshore, model 7407,
with a maximum magnetic field value of 2.5 T.

To a suspension of anhydrous NiBr2 (33.89 mg,
0.155 mmol) in toluene (1 mL), a toluene (3 mL) solution of Le (46.6 mg, 0.155 mmol) was added and heated for 3 h to get
a blue-violet precipitate. The precipitate upon filtration and vacuum
drying gave 55.5 mg (69% yield) of 2b. The CH2Cl2 solution of 1b when subjected to slow

Synthesis
of [Ni(Lm)2Br](ClO4), 2b
In a reaction aimed at the preparation
of 2b, a 3 mL MeOH solution of Ni(ClO4)·6H2O (128 mg, 0.350 mmol) was added to a solution of Lm (200 mg, 0.698 mmol) dissolved in 1 mL of MeOH. A greenish-brown
solution was obtained upon stirring for half an hour, and a green
solid was precipitated when a 0.5 mL MeOH solution of n-tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (113 mg, 0.348 mmol) was added. The
solid was filtered after stirring the mixture overnight and vacuum
dried to obtain a pista-green powder that weighed 215 mg (75% yield).
The complex was found to be soluble in CH2Cl2, CH3CN, and acetone and was sparingly soluble in MeOH
and EtOH. The pista-green powder was recrystallized from CH2Cl2 to give dark green diamond-shaped crystals. FT-IR

Synthesis of [Ni(Lm)2I](ClO4), 2c
A 2 mL MeOH solution of Ni(ClO4)·6H2O (191.9 mg, 0.524 mmol) was added to 1 mL MeOH
solution of Lm (300 mg, 1.05 mmol) under stirring at room
temperature. The solution turned greenish-brown when stirred for about
half an hour. Subsequently, the addition of NaI (78.6 mg, 0.524 mmol)
resulted in a yellowish-green precipitate. The reaction mixture was
stirred further for 10 h, and the complex was separated by decantation
and dried. The weight of the intense yellow-green powder was 315 mg

Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Suitable single crystals
of all six compounds were mounted on thin glass fibers with epoxy
glue and optically aligned on a Bruker APEX II charge-coupled device
X-ray diffractometer using a digital camera. Intensity data were measured
at 25 °C using Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.7103 Å).
APEX II software (Bruker AXS) was used for preliminary determination
of the cell constants and data collection control. Determination of
integral intensities and global refinement were performed using SAINT+
(Bruker AXS). The reflections were corrected for Lorentz and polarization
effects, and empirical absorption corrections were applied using the
SADABS program. The space groups were determined from systematic absences
and confirmed by the results of refinement. The structures were solved
by direct methods using the SHELXL software suit (SHELXS 86) and refined
by the full-matrix least squares method (on F2; SHELXL
97). All non-H (except some of the solvent molecules) were refined
with anisotropic displacement parameters, and all H atoms of the organic
ligands were placed at idealized positions and refined as riding atoms.
