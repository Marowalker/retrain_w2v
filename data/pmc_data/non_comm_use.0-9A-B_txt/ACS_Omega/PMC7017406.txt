The demand of lactulose
production is increasing tremendously because
of its bifidogenic (prebiotic) functionality. Therefore, the isomerization
of lactose to synthesize lactulose through electroactivation (EA)
technology is of great interest nowadays. However, lactulose production
through electroisomerization is affected by several operational and
experimental conditions, and the process needs to be optimized. In
this context, the EA technique was applied to isomerize lactose into
lactulose in an EA reactor modulated by anion and cation exchange
membranes. The effect of lactose concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20%),
applied electric fields (300, 600, and 900 mA), and processing time
(0–60 min) on lactose electroisomerization rate (lactulose
formation) and coproduct (glucose, galactose, and fructose) formation
has been investigated. The effect of different physicochemical parameters
such as pH, alkalinity, temperature, ion migration, and oxidation–reduction
potential (ORP) on the conversion of lactose into lactulose was correlated
with the lactulose formation to understand the involved process mechanism
of action. The conversion of lactose into lactulose was lactose-concentration-,
electric-current-, and EA-time-dependent and reached the highest lactulose
yield of 38% at 40 min using a 900 mA current intensity in a 10% lactose
solution. The results were then compared to conventional chemical
isomerization maintaining similar alkaline conditions at ambient temperature
(22 ± 2 °C). A higher yield of lactulose was achieved in
the EA process within a short reaction time compared to that of the
chemical isomerization. The outcome of this study suggests that EA
is a promising technique for the enhanced production of lactulose
from lactose.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
the demand of lactulose production is increasing tremendously
because of its bifidogenic (prebiotic) functionality with many applications
in food, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceutical industries. Lactulose
(4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-fructose) is a synthetic disaccharide composed of a galactose moiety
linked to a fructose moiety by a 1–4 β-glycosidic linkage.1,2 In pharmaceutical industries, lactulose is widely used as an effective
drug against different diseases like acute and chronic constipation,
hepatic encephalopathy, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease.1,3 Furthermore, it lowers blood glucose and insulin levels (antidiabetic),
increases mineral absorption, and has been reported as antiendotoxin,
effective in tumor prevention, as well as in hypocholesterolemia.4 In food industries, lactulose is used as a bifidus
factor and has purported high stability under thermal-acidic conditions
and thus can be used as an excellent ingredient for acidic foods,
such as fruit juices.4 Therefore, the isomerization
of lactose for large-scale production of lactulose has attracted extensive
research interests in recent times.

Currently, the commercial
lactulose is produced through the chemical
synthesis from lactose by following an isomerization reaction in an
alkaline medium according to the Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda van
Ekenstein (LA) transformation.1,3 Most of these processes
are generally characterized by a huge challenge for the low yield
of lactulose and subsequent byproduct formation such as epilactose,
galactose, glucose, and isosaccharinic acid due to the high level
of lactose degradation. However, the presence of side products is
undesirable, especially for food, pharmaceutical, and medical applications.1 Furthermore, a substantial amount of catalysts,
such as calcium hydroxide, sodium and potassium hydroxides, sodium
carbonate, magnesium oxide, tertiary amines, borates, sodium aluminates,
zeolites, and eggshell powders, have been used (both in homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalysis) to improve the reaction yield, which
led to the extensive separation and purification steps, and subsequent
increment in the production cost.5 Although
the uses of several complexing reagents such as aluminates and borates
could accelerate the reaction with a minimum of secondary reactions
and result in a high yield of lactulose by eliminating lactulose from
the reaction mixture in the form of a complex, however, they are considered
to be unsatisfactory from the industrial viewpoint because of the
toxicity and complexity of eliminating the aluminate and borate.6 In addition, the lack of reaction selectivity
of chemical isomerization has limited its application on a large scale.7 On the other hand, the lactulose synthesis by
the enzymatic process could be a suitable alternative to overcome
the limitations associated with the chemical synthesis since it is
usually carried out under mild conditions, which could limit the formation
of side products. Thus, it would provide a high-purity final product
and, consequently, could simplify the purification steps.8 However, the major problems are the low yield,
extended reaction time, and high production cost depending on the
microbial source of enzyme catalysts.7

Recently, an emerging technology called electroactivation (EA)
has been introduced and attracted particular attention for the isomerization
of lactose into lactulose without adding any alkalinizing chemicals.1,5 EA is a science devoted to studying the physicochemical and reactive
properties of aqueous solutions excited by an external electric field
in a reactor that is modulated by the appropriate disposition of electrodes
and ion-exchange membranes to modify the activation energy required
for the targeted chemical reactions.9 Fundamentally,
the charged species migrate toward the electrode of opposite charge,
when an aqueous solution is subjected to an external electric field.5 In fact, water splitting occurs at the interfaces
of electrodes with a simultaneous generation of protons (H+) and hydroxyl (OH–) ions.10 Thus, the EA process is able to self-generate acid and alkaline
conditions following the electrolysis of water molecules at the solution/anode
and solution/cathode interfaces, respectively.7 In the case of the lactose isomerization reaction, the alkaline
solution (catholyte) can be employed either in pure lactose or directly
in situ of whey to produce lactulose by following lactose isomerization.11 Indeed, a high alkaline condition is a prerequisite
to creating enough proton acceptors, required for the isomerization
reaction to occur and to neutralize the acids contained in the medium
that can inhibit the isomerization reaction.2,12 The
formed OH– ions at the cathode interface of the
EA reactor were capable of creating required alkaline conditions and
act as proton acceptors in the isomerization of lactose into lactulose.2,11,13,14

Generally, the conventional isomerization of lactose into
lactulose
was operated at a higher temperature and required longer reaction
time. In contrast, the EA process can be performed under relatively
low temperature (0–30 °C) and approximately 35–45%
lactulose yield with a purity of 95% can be achieved in short reaction
time.15 Kareb et al.16 achieved a maximum yield of 35% lactulose after 40 min
of reaction at a temperature of 10 °C under a 400 mA electric
current and using 100 mL of 7% sweet whey as feed solution. In a recent
study, Djouab and Aïder11 obtained
a yield of 38.66% lactulose at a current intensity of 330 mA for 14
min in a 5% lactose solution. The optimization of several parameters
such as current intensity, reaction time, electrolyte concentration,
and reactor configuration resulted in an increased lactulose yield
of up to 45%.17 These results were quite
higher than those obtained by chemical synthesis (∼16–25%
lactulose yield), which were operated at a higher temperature (∼70–130
°C) and prolonged reaction time (∼60–150 min) in
the presence of strong bases.18−20 Lately, the effect of several
process parameters of EA on the reaction yield, product purity, and
process efficiency such as current intensity, electric tension, concentration,
and the volume of feed solution, temperature, and reactor configuration
were studied by several researchers;5,11,16,17 however, the chemical
mechanisms behind this process are still not understood completely.
Moreover, the effect of several physicochemical parameters such as
solution alkalinity, ion migration, oxidation–reduction potential
(ORP), etc. on the process performance is not studied to date. Furthermore,
no study was devoted to evaluating the EA process efficiency in comparison
with the conventional chemical isomerization at equivalent solution
alkalinity. In this context, a detailed study of the physicochemical
principles involved in the EA process to produce lactulose using the
lactose aqueous solution is imperative to understand the process mechanism.

In this study, several EA process parameters such as lactose concentration,
electric current intensity, and EA duration were studied to understand
their effect on solution pH, alkalinity, temperature, ion migration,
ORP, and sugar profile. Furthermore, the conversion rate of lactose
into lactulose was compared with that of the conventional chemical
isomerization under equivalent solution alkalinity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Evolution of pH
The evolution of
pH in the cathodic compartment during 60 min of EA for different lactose
solutions (5, 10, 15, and 20%) at three different current intensities
(300, 600, and 900 mA) is presented in Figure 1. It can be seen that the current intensity,
EA time, and lactose concentration have a significant effect on the
pH of the medium in the cathodic compartment. The obtained data showed
that the pH increased drastically within the first 5 min for all current
intensities and concentrations. Thereafter, the pH was differently
increasing during the remaining 55 min EA time and was dependent on
the current intensity and lactose concentration. During this period,
the pH was increasing slowly until 60 min of EA and reached a plateau
for 300 and 600 mA current intensities. However, the pH evolution
reached a maximum value after 30 min of treatment under a 900 mA current
intensity, followed by a slight decreasing pattern after 30 min of
treatment whatever the lactose concentration used. The rate of increment
was observed to be higher for greater current intensities while it
was slightly lower for the higher lactose concentrations.

Figure 1 Evolution of
pH as a function of the EA time for (a) 5%, (b) 10%,
(c) 15%, and (d) 20% lactose solutions at different current intensities
(300, 600, and 900 mA).

Two phenomena of reduction
and oxidation have occurred during the
electrolysis of water or any aqueous solution. A reduction reaction
occurs at the negatively charged electrode (cathode),5,9 and electrons (e–) from the cathode are donated
to the positively charged ions, like hydrogen cations to form hydrogen
gas (H2) and OH– (eqs 1 and 2). The formation
of OH– ions was responsible for the pH increase
in the cathodic compartment.5,21 Indeed, pH is the most
important parameter in lactose isomerization for lactulose synthesis,
and it should be as high as possible (>pH 9) for isomerization
to
occur.5

Cathode (reduction) 1   2  The rate
of pH increment that was higher for
greater current intensities might be due to the more intensive formation
of OH– ions from the water electrolysis (eq 2). Consequently, an increase
in the concentration of the OH– ions was obtained
in the cathodic compartment, which leads to an increase of the solution
pH.11 This phenomenon was expected
because the rate of water electrolysis is directly proportional to
the electric current applied,15,16 because the flow of
electrons migrating through the electrochemical reactor might be increased
by amplifying the electric current intensity, and subsequently, a
higher dissociation of water molecules has occurred at the electrode/solution
interface.11,22 On the other hand, an oxidation
reaction has occurred at the positively charged electrode (anode),
and free electrons (e–) migrated to the anode.5,9 This migration produces oxygen gas (O2) by transferring
electrons to the anode (eq 3) and, consequently, lowering the pH of the anodic compartment
by increasing the H+ ions (eq 4). However, the inference of this acidic pH in the
anodic compartment and alkaline pH in the cathodic compartment has
been avoided using an anion exchange membrane (AEM) between the anodic
and the central compartments, and a cation exchange membrane (CEM)
between the cathodic and the central compartments (Figure 14).

Anode (oxidation) 3   4  A drastic increase of the
pH within the first
5 min of EA can be explained by the generation of a higher amount
of OH– ions due to the intensive water electrolysis
at the beginning of the reaction to allow the electric current transfer
in the cathode–solution interface. Thereafter, a lower rate
of pH increase was observed because the solution became saturated
with OH– ions.11,15 Similar observations
to this study were reported by Djouab and Aïder,11 and they found that the evolution of pH followed
a drastic increase (0–21 min) and a slower increase (21–63
min) during the EA of whey permeate (WP) with different current intensities
(110, 220, and 330 mA). They obtained a pH of 11.59 after 63 min EA
at a 330 mA current intensity for a 5% lactose solution. However,
the geometrical parameters in their study were different from those
used in the present one, mainly the cathodic compartment volume and
the distance between the cathode and the cation exchange membrane.
These parameters seem to be highly significant in terms of the overall
process performance. In the present study, the highest pH values of
11.64 ± 0.05 (60 min), 11.86 ± 0.07 (60 min), and 11.77
± 0.07 (30 min) were achieved for a 5% lactose solution at 300,
600, and 900 mA current intensities, respectively. The highest pH
values of 11.26 ± 0.04 (60 min), 11.48 ± 0.05 (60 min),
and 11.37 ± 0.09 (30 min) were achieved for a 10% lactose solution,
whereas they were 10.95 ± 0.07 (60 min), 11.10 ± 0.02 (60
min), 11.05 ± 0.03 (30 min) for a 20% lactose solution at 300,
600, and 900 mA current intensities, respectively. These results were
in good agreement with those previously reported.5,11 It
was observed that the rate of pH increment was slightly lower for
the higher lactose concentrations. Similar to this observation, Aider
and de Halleux3 reported that the pH of
the concentrated lactose solutions was more difficult to increase.
Likewise, Aider and Gimenez-Vidal5 reported
that the pH was instantly raised to the mean values of 11.46 ±
0.09 and 11.16 ± 0.11 during the first 10 min of EA at a 100
mA current intensity for 5 and 10% lactose solutions, respectively.
The rate of pH increment was slightly lower for the solutions with
higher lactose concentration because the rate of water electrolysis
was lower for a higher concentration of lactose.

In the present
study, the phenomenon consisting of a decline of
pH due to the rapid degradation of lactulose into galactose and acidic
compounds, which was previously reported for chemical lactulose synthesis,12,20 was not observed to have occurred for 300 and 600 mA current intensities.
However, the pH was observed to be decreased after 30 min of treatment
for 900 mA. The pH decrease could be attributed to the formation of
reaction byproducts with an acid character during this stage3 or to water splitting at the cation exchange
membrane interface facing the central compartment. The latter hypothesis
is more realistic because it has already been reported in a recent
study by Djouab and Aïder11 that
only a low level of galactose can be formed as a reaction byproduct
during the lactose electroisomerization in situ of whey permeate (WP).

2.2 Migration Pattern of Potassium Ions
The
variation of potassium concentration in the central compartment
was studied during the EA process of different lactose solutions (5,
10, 15, and 20%) at different current intensities (300, 600, and 900
mA), and the obtained results are presented in Figure 2. It appears that the concentrations of K+ were decreasing in the central compartment over the running
time for all current intensities and solution concentrations. The
decreasing rate was appeared to be higher at the beginning of the
reaction whatever the current intensities. However, the decreasing
rate was relatively higher for greater current intensities and higher
solution concentrations. It was observed that the K+ concentrations
were decreasing gradually following a quasi-linear behavior for 300
and 600 mA during the 60 min of EA process, whereas they were decreasing
more drastically during the first 30 min for a 900 mA current intensity.
Thereafter, it has steadily declined until the end of the EA process.
This observation regarding the migration of potassium ions from the
central compartment toward the cathodic one was correlated with the
evolution of pH when 900 mA was applied to the EA reactor. Indeed,
under this electric current intensity, the pH and solution alkalinity
decreased approximately after 30 min of EA. This may be caused by
water splitting at the cation exchange membrane (CEM)–solution
interface to compensate for the lack of the current carriers toward
the cathode. Thus, this water splitting created enough H+ ions, which competed for electromigration with the K+ ions.

Figure 2 Variation of potassium concentration in the central compartment
for (a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 15%, and (d) 20% lactose solutions during
the EA process at different current intensities (300, 600, and 900
mA).

The concentration of K+ was decreasing in the central
compartment because the cations (K+) of the used electrolyte
(K2SO4) migrated toward the cathode through
the CEM by the attraction of the negatively charged cathode,11 where there were OH– ions
and some other ions such as K+ and Cl– ions, which came from 0.01 M KCl added at the beginning of the process
to ensure the conductivity of the lactose solution. Similarly, the
anions (SO42–) might be migrated toward the anodic compartment (where there were
H+ ions) through the AEM by the attraction of the positively
charged anode (Figure 14). The rate of K+ ion migration was slowed down at the
end of the EA process. This could be explained by the concentration
polarization phenomenon, which was created by a difference between
the ion transfer numbers in the solution and in the membranes, leading
to a variation of the electrolyte concentration near the membrane
surface and a considerable potential drop in the polarized region
known as the Nernst layer, thus decreasing ion migration and solution
demineralization.23 However, it is obvious
that the migration of K+ ions was more intensive during
the first 30 min for a 900 mA current intensity because of higher
current intensity, and thereafter, it would have been reached to a
limiting current density.23 As a result,
the resistance of the system was significantly increased (Figure S1). At this stage, water dissociation
might be occurred at the interface between the CEM and solution in
the central compartment due to a continuous current regime.23 Consequently, more H+ and OH– ions would have been produced by water splitting at
the interface of the CEM to avoid the ion depletion in the central
compartment (eq 5). The
newly generated H+ ions might be migrated to the cathodic
compartment through the CEM by the attraction of the negatively charged
cathode.11 The H+ ions might
be competing with K+ ions to travel toward the cathodic
compartment due to the higher electrical mobility of the H+ ions than K+ ions. Thus, the rate of K+ ion
migration has been slowed down more apparently after 30 min of EA
at a current intensity of 900 mA. This fact of H+ ion migration
from the central compartment could also be correlated to the decrease
in pH after 30 min of EA for that causing acidification of the solution
of the cathodic compartment11 5  

2.3 Evolution
of Alkalinity
The variation
of alkalinity in the cathodic compartment was determined for different
lactose solutions (5, 10, 15, and 20%) during the EA process at different
current intensities of 300, 600, and 900 mA, as shown in Figure 3. It appeared that
the current intensity and running time have a highly significant effect
(p < 0.001) on solution alkalinity. It was linearly
increasing during the 60 min of EA for a 300 mA current intensity
and reached 28.53, 31.73, 32.27, and 34.13 mmol/L of alkalinity for
5, 10, 15, and 20% lactose solutions, respectively. For a 600 mA current
intensity, it has been increased during the 60 min of EA but showed
some incurving behavior that could be interpreted as a tendency to
reach a plateau. A maximum alkalinity of 43.47, 43.20, 43.20, and
40.80 mmol/L was achieved at the end of the reaction for 5, 10, 15,
and 20% lactose solutions, respectively. Contrary to 300 and 600 mA,
the alkalinity of the catholyte (electroactivated lactose solution)
reached a maximum value of 35.73, 30.13, 34.13, and 27.20 mmol/L after
30 min of treatment, and thereafter, it was decreasing gradually down
to 16.27, 7.73, 10.93, and 4.53 mmol/L at the end of the EA treatment
for 5, 10, 15, and 20% lactose solutions, respectively.

Figure 3 Variation of
alkalinity in (a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 15%, and (d) 20%
lactose solutions during the EA process at different current intensities
(300, 600, and 900 mA).

Generally, the isomerization
reaction requires proton acceptors
(OH– ions), and this can be achieved in a high alkaline
medium through water electrolysis at the cathode/solution interface
under the influence of an external electrical field.15 As seen from Figure 3, the evolution of alkalinity was significantly higher for
greater current intensities, except when the conditions leading to
water splitting were reached such as the case, after 30 min of EA
when 900 mA was used. This is attributed to the fact that the higher
current intensity resulted in faster decomposition of water.16 The alkalinity was gradually increased during
the 60 min of EA for 300 and 600 mA because the dissociation of water
at both electrode interfaces produces H+ and OH– ions, as discussed in Section 2.1. The OH– ions in the cathodic side
might be attracted by the positively charged anode, but the ions transported
by the electric current repulsed by the negatively charged CEM. Thus,
the high concentration of OH– ions at the cathode
interface was able to create an alkaline condition and could act as
proton acceptors, which is a key condition for the occurrence of the
isomerization reaction of lactose into lactulose.5,11 Moreover,
the K+ ions were continuously migrating to the cathodic
compartment, which reacted with the OH– ions to
make high alkalinity of the catholyte (eq 6). However, they reached a plateau after 30
min of EA for a 900 mA current intensity, which might be attributed
to the saturation of the catholyte with the OH– ions.
Thereafter, the alkalinity was gradually decreasing because the migrated
H+ ions from the central compartment caused acidification
of the solution, as discussed in the previous Section 2.2. This result is in concordance with the
pH decline after 30 min of EA for a 900 mA current intensity 6  

2.4 Evolution
of Oxidation–Reduction Potential
(ORP)
The evolution of ORP in the cathodic compartment during
the EA of different lactose solutions (5, 10, 15, and 20%) at different
current intensities (300, 600, and 900 mA) is shown in Figure 4. The ORP values in the cathodic
compartment were decreased drastically to a value of around −800
mV within the first 5 min of EA for all current intensities and concentrations
used and then reached a quasi-steady state. Thereafter, it remained
almost constant during the 60 min of treatment for 300 and 600 mA.
However, a minor increasing tendency was observed after 30 min for
900 mA. No significant changes were observed for the solution concentrations.

Figure 4 Evolution
of ORP in (a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 15%, and (d) 20% lactose
solutions during the EA process at different current intensities (300,
600, and 900 mA).

The ORP is one of the
most important parameters of water or any
aqueous solution that can be modified by means of EA. In fact, EA
is the process of transferring any solution into a nonequilibrium
thermodynamic state, which is accompanied by a change in the internal
energy of the system.24 The observed reducing
ORP of the EA solution in the cathodic compartment is also due, to
a high extent, to its saturation by hydrogen gas that is formed following
water electrolysis at the cathode–solution interface. Indeed,
it is well known that hydrogen gas is a reducing agent when it reacts
with nonmetals. The results obtained in the present study were in
good agreement with those previously reported by Nabok and Plutahin.25 They obtained the ORP values of −767
and +905 mV by means of the electroactivation of aqueous solutions
in the cathodic and anodic chambers, respectively, while the control
aqueous solution exhibited an ORP of +220 mV. This phenomenon can
be explained by the formation of unstable complexes, such as (OO),
(OO)+, and (HH)+ due to the dissociation of
water molecules and their vibrational modes.9,26 Shironosov
and Shironosov27 also explained the anomalies
in the pH and ORP of EA water by the stable, high-energy resonant
water microclusters due to covibrating dipoles of water molecules
and charged species near-electrode interfaces. In another study by
Hricova et al.,28 an acidic electrolyzed
water (pH: 2–3, ORP > 1100 mV) and a basic electrolyzed
water
(pH: 10–13, ORP: −800 to −900 mV) were obtained
by the electrolysis of dilute NaCl solution. The electroactivated
solutions in the cathodic chamber were characterized by a negative
ORP, which probably related to a training effect of excess electrons
(e–) formed after electrochemical activation.29 Moreover, EA is an electrochemical process that
can cause the formation of different ionic species and radicals, e.g.,
the formation of highly active reducers such as OH–, H–, •H, •HO, •O–, •O2–, •HO2–, H2O2–, and H3O2–, which may
lead to a high reduction potential.5

In the present study, the ORP values in the cathodic compartment
were decreased sharply to a value of around −800 mV within
the first 5 min of the EA process. The drastic change in ORP within
the first 5 min was attributed to the generation of excessive electrons
and the formation of other highly active reducers because of the rigorous
electrolysis of the solution. Besides the formation of diverse compounds,
the EA induced dynamic water electrolysis in the cathodic compartment,
resulting in an enhancement of the negative charge concentration through
the accumulation of the hydroxyl groups.30 Thereafter, it reached a quasi-steady state when the system became
saturated with the charged species. The slight increase in ORP (i.e.,
reactivity decreased) after 30 min of EA for 900 mA might be due to
the migration of H+ H3O+ H3SO4+ toward
the cathodic compartment from the central compartment because the
newly migrated ions might reduce the number of electrons (e.g., 2H+ + 2e– → H2(g)) in the
cathodic compartment.

2.5 Evolution of Temperature
The changes
in temperature in the cathodic compartment were observed during the
EA process of different lactose solutions (5, 10, 15, and 20%) at
different current intensities (300, 600, and 900 mA), as presented
in Figure 5. The temperature
was gradually increased during the 60 min of the EA process for all
current intensities and solution concentrations. The rate of increment
was significantly higher for the greater current intensities. As can
be seen for a 5% lactose solution (Figure 5a), the temperature was significantly increased
to 29.30, 37.97, and 48.70 °C for 300, 600, and 900 mA current
intensities, respectively. Some increase in temperature was also observed
for the higher concentrations of lactose solutions; however, the difference
was not too significant even if some tendency was noticed. For instance,
the temperature was slightly increased to 37.97, 38.80, 38.99, and
40.87 °C when a 600 mA current intensity was used for 5, 10,
15, and 20% lactose solution concentrations, respectively.

Figure 5 Variation of
temperature in (a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 15%, and (d) 20%
lactose solutions during the EA process at different current intensities
(300, 600, and 900 mA).

The observed temperature
rise is mainly the result of the Joule
effect in the electrodes, and the generated heat was dissipated in
the solution. It was not due to the system electrical resistance because
the solutions used in the EA reactor were conductive enough and allowed
easy current transfer through the system, which led to a greater water
dissociation to create high alkalinity in the cathodic side of the
reactor. Some initial resistance of the ion-exchange membranes used
could also at some extent contribute to the temperature rise. Indeed,
Cifuentes-Araya et al.23 reported that
the initial system global resistance in a membrane process can be
due to the intrinsic resistance of the membranes and the resistance
of the feed solutions, whereas the system global resistance during
and at the end of the process was correlated with an evolutionary
demineralization and the presence of fouling. Nevertheless, Djouab
and Aïder11 did not reveal any fouling
of membrane in the EA of pure lactose and WP. Therefore, the global
electrical resistance (Figure S1) occurred
in the present study, which might be due to the intrinsic resistance
of the membranes and the resistance of the feed solutions. The demineralization
due to the ion migration could be another possible reason for decreasing
conductivity in the central compartment, as discussed in Section 2.2. As a result,
the resistance of the system was increased significantly. Thus, the
variation of temperature during the isomerization time might be a
consequence of the decreased conductivity of the lactose solution
during the passage of the electric current.15 The rate of temperature increment was significantly higher for the
greater current intensities because the heated energy dissipation
(i.e., the increase in temperature) is proportional to the increase
in the electric current and electric tension, as described by Joule’s
law.15 An increase in temperature was also
observed for the higher lactose concentrations, which might be due
to the higher resistance for greater concentrations of the feed solution.

2.6 Evolution of Lactulose Formation
The isomerization
yield of lactose into lactulose during the EA process
at different current intensities (300, 600, and 900 mA) was studied
over time (60 min) for different lactose concentrations (5, 10, 15,
and 20%), as presented in Figure 6. As can be observed, the current intensity, running
time, and solution concentration had a significant effect (p < 0.001) on the conversion rate of lactose into lactulose.

5%, (b) 10%, (c) 15%, and (d) 20% lactose solutions at different current
intensities (300, 600, and 900 mA).

From Figure 6a for
a 5% feed solution, it can be seen that the lactulose was gradually
increased until 50 min for 600 mA and thereafter reached a plateau
(∼37% lactulose); however, it reached the plateau at 30 min
for 900 mA (∼37% lactulose) and then slightly decreased at
the end of the EA process (∼36% lactulose). Whereas, the formation
of lactulose was sharply increased to ∼30% until 35 min for
300 mA, and no significant enhancement was observed afterward (∼33%
at 60 min). For 10% lactose (Figures 6b and 7), the lactulose yield
was increased until the end for 600 mA and thereafter reached a plateau
(∼36% lactulose), but it reached the plateau at 40 min for
900 mA (∼38% lactulose) and later slightly decreased (∼36%
lactulose). However, the formation of lactulose was started at 15
min for 300 mA (∼12% lactulose) and then gradually increased
until the end (∼29% lactulose). As can be seen from Figure 6c (for a 15% lactose
solution), the lactulose began to form at different times for different
current intensities such as 25, 35, and 60 min for 900, 600, and 300
mA, respectively. It can be observed that ∼36% lactulose was
produced for 900 mA at 60 min, while it was only ∼13% for 300
mA and ∼25% for 600 mA. On the other hand, no lactulose was
formed for 300 mA during the 60 min EA process when a 20% lactose
solution was used (Figure 6d). However, ∼31% lactulose was produced at 60 min
for 900 mA, while it was only ∼21% for 600 mA.

(c) at 600 mA after 60 min (36%), and (d) at 900 mA after 40 min (38%).

2.6.1 Effect of Solution pH
The pH of
the lactose solution had a significant (p < 0.001)
influence on lactulose formation. However, different phenomena were
observed depending on the lactose solution concentration. For a 5%
lactose solution, lactulose was started to form while the pH was above
10 (pH > 10.00). It can be seen from Figure 1a that the pH reached 10 within 5 min of
EA for all three current intensities, and lactulose was started to
form at the same time (Figure 6a). Whereas, for 10% lactose, the lactulose was found to be
created while the pH achieved a value higher than 10.30 (pH > 10.30).
Although the pH reached 10.30 within 5 min of EA for 600 mA and 900
mA current intensities (Figure 1b), however, it reached beyond 10.30 at 15 min for 300 mA
and the lactulose began to produce at the same time (Figure 6b). On the other hand, no lactulose
was found until the pH reached above 11 (pH ≈ 11.10) for 15
and 20% lactose solutions. Consequently, the formation of lactulose
was observed to begin at different EA times (Figure 6c), and even no lactulose was found for 300
mA in a 20% lactose solution (Figure 6d) because the pH never reached 11. It can be seen
(Figure 1) that the
pH was observed to be decreased after 30 min of EA at 900 mA for all
lactose concentrations. It is interesting to mention that the formation
of lactulose was almost stable at that condition (after 30 min of
EA at 900 mA) in 5 and 10% lactose solutions even though the pH decreased
slightly. In contrast, the formation of lactulose was found to increase
in the same condition (after 30 min of EA at 900 mA) for 15 and 20%
lactose solutions. It is worth noting that the rate of lactulose formation
was always higher for greater current intensities, and this phenomenon
was correlated to the pH evolution. Furthermore, the formation of
galactose increased linearly with lactulose until the end of the EA
process (Figure 8).
The yield of galactose was increased with isomerization time because
the lactulose formed by the isomerization reaction was later hydrolyzed
into galactose (Figure S2).15 Nevertheless, the results showed that only galactose
was generated as a side product; no other impurities (such as tagatose,
epilactose, etc.) were found in the reaction medium (Figure 7). However, trace amounts of
glucose and fructose were found in some cases depending on the experimental
conditions (Figure 7 and Table S1). Here, it can be mentioned
that the glucose and fructose could be isomerized into galactose during
the EA process of lactose, whey, or WP (Figure S2).11,16

Figure 8 Formation of galactose as a function of
the EA time for (a) 5%,
(b) 10%, (c) 15%, and (d) 20% lactose solutions at different current
intensities (300, 600, and 900 mA).

As can be seen from Figure 8, the formation of galactose followed a similar trend for
all concentrations. However, the greater current intensity and running
time led to the increased formation of galactose (Figure 9). For instance, the formation
of galactose was higher at a 900 mA current intensity, particularly,
it increased drastically after 30 min of EA (Figures 8 and 9), while the
pH was slightly decreased (Figure 1). In this case, the longer treatment time was immaterial
but energy consuming, since no significant increase in lactulose formation
was observed after 30 min but increased the galactose formation to
an unacceptable level. This finding of the present study was in good
agreement with those previously reported for lactose and WP.11,17 Here, it can be noted that the commercial lactulose (as syrup) must
not contain more than 12% lactose, 16% galactose, 8% epilactose, and
1% fructose according to United States Pharmacopeia.31

(c) at 900 mA after 30 min (6.54%), and (d) at 900 mA after 60 min
(20%).

2.6.2 Effect
of Lactose Solution Alkalinity
The isomerization of lactose
into lactulose is feasible only under
a high alkaline condition because the high alkalinity of the reaction
medium is a sine qua non condition for the successful conversion of
lactose into lactulose.5 Indeed, the molecular
rearrangement of lactose into lactulose requires proton acceptors,
which was ensured by achieving a high alkaline medium in the cathodic
compartment of the EA reactor.5,16 However, different
amounts of alkalinity were observed to be required for producing lactulose
in different lactose solutions. Lactulose began to form while the
alkalinity obtained a value of ∼3 and ∼5 mmol/L for
5 and 10% lactose solutions, respectively; thereafter, it was increasing
with time. It is worth noting that the rate of lactulose formation
was hindered but not reduced while the alkalinity was decreasing after
30 min at 900 mA (Figure 3a,b); rather, it reached a plateau and remained stable (Figure 6a,b). On the other
hand, no lactulose was found to be produced before the alkalinity
reached beyond ∼30 mmol/L for 15 and 20% lactose solutions.
Consequently, the formation of lactulose was noticed to start at different
times of EA (Figure 6c,d), and even no lactulose was found for 300 mA in a 20% lactose
solution (Figure 6d).
Unlike 5 and 10% lactose solutions, a different scenario was observed
for 15 and 20% lactose solutions at 900 mA, where the lactulose formation
was not impeded, even though the alkalinity was decreasing after 30
min (Figure 3c,d).
However, the formation of galactose was seen to be drastically increased
at this stage (i.e., after 30 min at 900 mA) of EA for all lactose
concentrations (Figure 8).

2.6.3 Effect of Temperature
The temperature
is one of the most important parameters in the isomerization of lactose
into lactulose. During the EA process, the temperature increased throughout
the isomerization time, which has already been explained in the previous Section 2.5. As can be
seen from Figure 6,
the formation of lactulose was proportional to the temperature increment,
i.e., increasing the temperature increases the production of lactulose.
However, the formation of byproduct, i.e., galactose, was also increased
with increasing the temperature. Similar findings to the present study
have been reported in several studies.15,32 This might
be due to the increased conductivity of lactose with the increase
of temperature because the ions that were present in the solution
(i.e., K+, SO42–) moved quickly at the high temperature and at the
crossing of the electrical current.7 The
amount of galactose increased with the elevated temperature because
greater activation energy formed and which pushed the reaction on
the other side pathways.16,20 It seems to be important
to point out that the synthesis of lactulose without heat is possibly
contrary to that already been reported in the literature. The alkaline
isomerization of lactose to lactulose via the LA rearrangement was
usually carried out at a high temperature in the range of 50–130
°C combined with different reaction times.18−20,33,34 Contrary to these studies,
the temperature has never been exceeded 50 °C in the present
study using EA. Similar to this study, Aissa and Aïder7 demonstrated that lactulose could be obtained
at a low temperature such as 0, 5, and 10 °C in the EA reactor.
They achieved a lactulose yield of 25 ± 1.34% (with a purity
of 95 ± 1.34%) at a temperature of 0 °C and a pH of 10–10.50
at a short duration of 2 min using the EA process.7

2.7 Conventional Chemical Lactose
Isomerization
The conventional isomerization reactions were
carried out at ambient
temperature using similar lactose concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20%)
and generating equivalent alkalinity as those generated using 300,
600, and 900 mA in the EA treatment. The alkalinity-equivalent tests
were conducted to observe the lactulose yield compared to the results
obtained by EA under similar solution alkalinity. The obtained results
are presented in Figure 10. As can be observed, the pH, running time, and solution concentration
had a significant effect on the conversion rate of lactose into lactulose.
For 5 and 10% lactose (Figure 10a,b), the lactulose was gradually increased until the
end of the reactions, although they started to form at a different
reaction time. On the other hand, no lactulose was found to be formed
for 15 and 20% lactose solutions during the isomerization process,
except for the alkalinity equivalent to 900 mA in a 15% lactose feed
solution (Figure 10c,d).

Figure 10 Formation of lactulose as a function of isomerization time for
(a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 15%, and (d) 20% lactose solutions.

It can be seen for 5% lactose that approximately ∼12,
∼23,
and ∼20% lactulose were formed at the end of the reactions
for the alkalinity of equivalent to that of the EA treatments at 300,
600, and 900 mA, respectively (Figure 10a). These results were correlated to the
pH rise of 11.31, 11.65, and 11.58 for the equivalent alkalinity to
the EA treatments at 300, 600, and 900 mA, respectively (Figure 11a). Although the
increment of pH in a 10% lactose solution (Figure 11b) was less than that of a 5% lactose solution,
however, the lactulose formation was comparatively higher for a 10%
lactose solution (Figure 10b). The yields of lactulose for a 10% lactose solution were
∼13, ∼27, and ∼26% for the alkalinity of equivalent
to 300, 600, and 900 mA, respectively (Figures 10b and 12), and the
pH values were 11.06, 11.33, and 11.08 for the alkalinity of equivalent
to 300, 600, and 900 mA, respectively (Figure 11b). As can be seen from Figure 10c (for a 15% lactose solution),
∼25% lactulose was produced only for equivalent to 900 mA at
a pH of 10.93, but no lactulose was found for equivalent to 300 and
600 mA, even though the pH reached 10.87 and 11.11 at the end of the
reaction, respectively (Figure 11c). On the other hand, no lactulose was formed when
a 20% lactose solution was used (Figure 10d), which might be due to the inadequate
pH values of 10.72, 10.85, and 10.57 for an equivalent to 300, 600,
and 900 mA, respectively (Figure 11d).

mA after 60 min (27%), and (d) equivalent to 900 mA after 30 min (26%).

It has been previously reported that the highest
isomerization
yield in an alkaline medium could be achieved with a pH of 1120,34 and at temperatures higher than 70 °C.17,35,36 In a recent study, Seo et al.37 observed that the lactulose yield could be increased
from 4 to 29.6% in a 20 min reaction time by increasing the temperature
from 60 to 90 °C using cheese whey as lactose source and sodium
carbonate as catalyst. Hashemi and Ashtiani20 achieved an optimum conversion of 25.40%% (with 5.58% galactose
as byproduct) at 70 °C and a pH of 11 for 60 min using 10% lactose
in the feed solution. In our study, the same amount of lactulose (i.e.,
25.85%) was obtained at ambient temperature and pH 11.08 (alkalinity
equivalent to EA at 900 mA in 10% lactose) in 30 min. Moreover, only
0.84% galactose was produced as the byproduct at this condition due
to the reduced temperature. It is worth noting from this finding that
the lactulose can be produced at ambient temperature using adequate
solution alkalinity. This new finding from the present work is fundamentally
essential because it highlighted the fact that not only the solution
pH but also its alkalinity are very important to achieve the isomerization
reaction of lactose into lactulose. Besides, it has been reported
that the conversion of lactose into lactulose was typically followed
by a rapid degradation of lactulose into galactose, tagatose, epilactose,
and many other byproducts with an acidic character such as isosaccharinic
acids and formic acids in the chemical-based processes,11,20,38−40 causing the
lowering of pH in a medium.12,20 Basically, heating
lactose in an alkaline solution causes isomerization and degradation
of lactose and lactulose; epilactose and galactose were produced.20,32 However, this phenomenon did not occur in the present study, and
consequently, only glucose was found as the reaction byproduct other
than that of galactose (Tables S2 and S3).

Not only the pH and temperature, but the solution alkalinity
was
also a key factor in lactulose production. For example, lactulose
began to form at an alkalinity of 9.07 mmol/L (pH = 10.43, 10 min,
alkalinity equivalent to 600 mA) in 5% lactose, whereas it was 18.67
mmol/L (pH 10.71, 20 min, alkalinity equivalent to 600 mA) in 10%
lactose. Nevertheless, the pH was also varied for the same amount
of alkalinity/catalyst depending on the solution concentrations and
consequently influenced the lactulose yield. For instance, although
the same amount of alkalinity (∼43 mmol/L at alkalinity equivalent
to 600 mA for 5, 10, and 15% lactose concentrations) was produced
at the end of the reactions (60 min), however, the pH values were
11.65, 11.33, and 11.11 and lactulose was 22.73, 27.13, and 0% for
5, 10, and 15% lactose concentrations, respectively. It is also important
to note that the concentration of the catalyst and the rate of pH
or alkalinity generation, i.e., the dosing pattern of the catalyst,
might play a pivotal role in the lactulose yield. For example, the
alkalinity (concentration of the catalyst) and the pH were almost
the same at the end of the reaction for alkalinity equivalent to 300
mA (at 60 min) and 900 mA (at 30 min) in a 10% lactose solution. However,
the formation of lactulose (i.e., 28.85%) for alkalinity equivalent
to 900 mA at 30 min was higher than for the lactulose (i.e., 13.41%)
of alkalinity equivalent to 300 mA at 60 min. A similar phenomenon
was also found for alkalinity equivalent to 300 mA and 900 mA in a
15% lactose solution. Thus, from the obtained results of the chemical
lactose isomerization into lactulose at alkalinity-equivalent conditions
as those formed during EA, it can be observed that the EA technique
was far more effective than the chemical method.

It is also
worth noting that the ORPs in the chemical isomerization
of different lactose solutions (5, 10, 15, and 20%) were reduced only
to a value of around +50 to +100 mV within the first 5 min depending
on the concentration and alkalinity (equivalent to different current
intensities), as shown in Figure 13. Thereafter, it gradually decreased till the end of
the reaction and then reached a value of around 0 mV. In contrast,
the ORP values in EA were decreased drastically to a value of around
−800 mV within the first 5 min for all current intensities
and concentrations and remained almost steady during the EA process
(Figure 4). The electric
field triggers the feed solution to be transformed into a metastable
state and made the solution highly activated. Therefore, the reduced
ORP of the EA lactose solutions in a metastable state rendered the
solutions highly reactive because the reactivity of the electroactivated
solutions was significantly increased under this state than a normal
state.9 Thus, the excessive internal potential
energy of the activated solution possibly intensified the isomerization
reaction of lactose into lactulose. Consequently, a higher yield of
lactulose was achieved in the EA process compared to that of the chemical
isomerization. Therefore, the modified ORP and critical pH of the
EA lactose solutions in a metastable state could make the solutions
highly reactive and convenient for nonconventional chemical reactions
and different applications in the food industry and biotechnology,
including food safety.9,41 Indeed, the ORP of the drinking
water/aqueous solutions should be negative to be highly efficient
for physiological activities in humans.9,42

3 Conclusions
In this study, the electroisomerization
of lactose into lactulose
was successfully carried out using the EA technology. Moreover, lactose
isomerization into lactulose by EA was compared with the chemical
method using KOH at equivalent solution alkalinity as in the EA method.
The obtained results demonstrated that in contrast to the chemical
method, the EA process was found to give a higher yield of lactulose
in a reduced reaction time for all conditions. The highest lactulose
yield was obtained during the electroisomerization process of lactose
and was ∼38% at 40 min using a 900 mA current intensity in
a 10% lactose solution with a solution pH of 11.27 and the alkalinity
of 21.07 mmol/L. The highest lactulose yield obtained during the conventional
chemical isomerization process was ∼27% at 60 min in a 10%
lactose solution, while the pH was 11.33 for the alkalinity of 43.20
mmol/L (equivalent to 600 mA in EA). The correlated lactulose yield
with the process parameters suggested that the lactulose can be produced
at ambient temperature without additional heating if the required
alkaline condition is achieved, although a higher temperature was
positively correlated to the lactulose formation but leading to a
higher byproduct formation. A highly alkaline condition was required
for the formation of lactulose; however, the lactulose produced in
the medium did not reduce during the EA process while the alkalinity
has been declined. Furthermore, EA triggers the feed solution to transfer
into a metastable state characterized by unusual values of the chemical
and physical parameters such as the ORP, pH, and alkalinity. Thus,
it can be concluded on the basis of the compared approaches (EA vs
chemical) that EA significantly reduced the activation energy required
for the isomerization reaction of lactose into lactulose, and consequently,
a higher yield of lactulose was achieved within a shorter duration
at ambient temperature compared to that of the chemical isomerization
using KOH as catalyst. In addition, the electroisomerization process
was carried out under complete autocatalytic conditions, i.e., no
alkali was added to the reaction medium. Finally, the findings of
this study provide an insight into the feasibility of the electroisomerization
of lactose into lactulose and its process mechanism of action. In
contrast to the chemical method, the EA process was found to offer
a higher potential for an economic and environmentally friendly approach
to produce lactulose by the isomerization of lactose. However, further
research is still required to understand the thermodynamics behind
the EA phenomena of aqueous solutions, mainly regarding its action
on the reaction activation energy.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
The high-purity
chemicals and reagents (purity ≥ 95%) of analytical or high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade were obtained from different suppliers.
Lactose, lactulose, fructose, glucose, and galactose (HPLC grade)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Phenolphthalein
(C20H14O4) was procured from MAT
Laboratory Inc. (Laboratoire Mat Inc., Quebec, Canada). Potassium
chloride (KCl) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were procured from Fisher
Chemical (Geel, Belgium). Potassium sulfate (K2SO4) and lactose (C12H22O11·H2O) powder used in this study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. (St. Louis, MO). All solutions were prepared in deionized (DI)
water. The cation exchange membrane (CEM) and anion exchange membrane
(AEM) were purchased from Membrane International Inc. (Ringwood, NJ)
and were used directly in the reactor without any pretreatment.

4.2 Electroactivation Protocol
An EA
reactor made of Plexiglas, comprising of three compartments (anodic,
central, and cathodic compartments), was used in this study (Figure 14). In brief, the anodic compartment was linked to the positive
side of a DC-regulated power generator (model: CSI12001X, CircuitSpecialists.com)
through a titanium electrode coated with ruthenium–iridium
(RuO2–IrO2–TiO2), and
the cathodic compartment was connected to the negative side using
a food-grade stainless steel electrode. The anodic and cathodic compartments
were separated by the central compartment, and it was communicating
with the anodic and cathodic compartments through an anion (AMI 7001S)
and a cation (CMI 7000S) exchange membrane, respectively. The freshly
prepared lactose solution (350 mL) of different concentrations (5,
10, 15, and 20%; w/v) in 0.01 M KCl was placed in the cathodic compartment,
whereas the central and anodic compartments were filled with the 0.1
M K2SO4 solution. The experiments were carried
out under different current intensities set at 300, 600, and 900 mA
for 60 min. The samples were collected from the cathodic and central
compartments in a regular interval of 5 min and were kept at 4 °C
until further analysis. All experiments were conducted at ambient
temperature (22 ± 2 °C). Prior to each batch, the EA reactor
was properly cleaned with DI water and filled with DI water after
each use to maintain high membrane hydration.

the electroactivation reactor used for the
isomerization of lactose to lactulose.

4.3 Evaluation of pH, Alkalinity, Oxidation–Reduction
Potential (ORP), and Temperature
The temperature, ORP, pH,
and alkalinity of the lactose solution in the cathodic compartment
were measured in 5 min intervals during the 60 min of the EA process.
The pH was determined using an Oakton pH 700 digital pH meter equipped
with a pH probe (Oakton, Vernon Hills, IL). The temperature and ORP
were measured using an ORP meter (Ultrapen, Myron L Company, Carlsbad,
CA). Titratable alkalinity (catholyte) of the electroactivated lactose
solutions was determined using a titration method. In brief, 5 mL
of the corresponding solution was collected from the cathodic compartment
in a beaker. Thereafter, two drops of phenolphthalein were added to
form a pink color, and the sample was titrated from the burette filled
with 0.1 M HCl. The catholyte was titrated until the pink color disappeared.
The final volume of 0.1 M HCl in the burette was recorded when the
end point reached. Finally, the total alkalinity was calculated using eq 7 and expressed in mmol/L 7  Vtitrant: the
total volume of the titrant (0.1 M HCl) used for titration in mL; Ctitrant: the titrant concentration in mol/L; Vsample: the volume of the sample that was taken
for titration in mL; total alkalinityeq: equivalent NaOH/KOH
concentration in the electroactivated solutions in mmol/L(equiv).

4.4 Determination of Potassium Concentration
The concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the central
compartment was determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. The
samples (that were collected from the central compartment in a regular
interval of 5 min during the 60 min of EA process) were analyzed according
to a standard protocol for the atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer
Instruments, model: AAnalyst 200).

4.5 Conventional
Chemical Isomerization of Lactose
Conventional chemical isomerization
was carried out using similar
lactose concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20%) in the feed solutions
and adding the equivalent (to the total alkalinity in EA) amounts
of potassium hydroxide (KOH) to the feed. In brief, the total alkalinity
(mmol/L) of the EA lactose solutions was expressed to the equivalent
amounts of KOH (mg/L). The equivalent amount of KOH was added to the
feed in a regular interval of 10 min, and the mixture was stirred
at ambient temperature (22 ± 2 °C). The pH and ORP were
monitored in 5 min intervals during the 60 min of reaction. The samples
were collected from the feed solution at a regular interval of 5 min
and were kept at 4 °C until further analysis.

4.6 Determination of Sugar Composition
The sugar contents
of all samples (i.e., EA lactose solutions and
chemically isomerized lactose solutions) were determined using a high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Waters, Millipore Corp., Milford,
MA). The system was equipped with a refractive index detector (Hitachi,
model: L-7490) and a carbohydrate analysis column (Waters Sugar Pak-I,
300 × 6.5 mm2, Waters Co.). The column temperature
was maintained at 90 °C. The isocratic mobile phase consisting
of a solution of 50 mg/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was
used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The injection
volume was 50 μL, and the running time was set at 30 min per
sample. The identification and quantification of sugars were accomplished
by comparing their retention times with the standard solutions of
lactose, lactulose, glucose, galactose, and fructose.

4.7 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed using a complete randomized factorial design
with repeated measurements. The factors were current intensity, lactose
concentration, and reaction time. The dependent variables were the
pH of the catholyte, alkalinity, K+ ion migration, temperature,
ORP, lactulose yield, as well as the yield of byproducts (galactose,
glucose, and fructose). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate,
and mean values ± standard deviation was used. Differences at p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) of the data was performed using SAS software (V9.3,
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
