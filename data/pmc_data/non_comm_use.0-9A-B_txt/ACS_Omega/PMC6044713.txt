Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution poses significant
health risks worldwide, including metabolic syndrome-related diseases
with the characteristic feature of insulin resistance. However, the
mechanism and influencing factors of this effect are poorly understood.
In this serial in vitro study, we aimed at testing the hypothesis
that macrophage-mediated effects of PM2.5 on hepatic insulin
resistance depend on its chemical composition. Mouse macrophages were
exposed to PM2.5 that had been collected during summer
or winter in Beijing, which represented different compositions of
PM2.5. Thereafter, hepatocytes were treated with macrophage-conditioned
medium (CM). PM2.5 induced interleukin-6, tumor necrosis
factor-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression
and secretion in macrophages, particularly after winter PM2.5 exposure. Correspondingly, winter CM weakened hepatocellular insulin-stimulated
glucose consumption. Further investigation revealed that the normal
insulin pathway was suppressed in winter CM-treated hepatocytes, with
increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine
residue 307 (Ser307) and decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase
B (PKB/AKT) and forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FoxO1). Moreover,
c-Jun N-terminal kinase, a key moderator of the sensitivity response
to insulin stimulation, was activated in hepatocytes treated with
winter CM. Although further studies are warranted, this preliminary
study suggested an association between PM composition and insulin
resistance, thus contributing to our understanding of the systemic
toxicity of PM2.5.

==== Body
Introduction
It has been suggested
that particulate matter (PM) air pollution
is a significant risk factor for human health worldwide. It contributed
to about 2.9 million deaths in 2013 according to the Global Burden
of Disease study.1 In China,
ambient PM was the fourth major risk factor, resulting in 1.2 million
premature deaths in 2010, with it being the major cause of chronic
noncommunicable diseases including respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases.2 In addition, a series of epidemiological
studies have proposed that PM exposure is associated with several
other metabolic syndrome-related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes
mellitus and atherosclerosis.3,4

Among the particles,
fine PM refers to those with an aerodynamic
diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5). They have different shapes
and chemical compositions5−7 and thus have different surface
properties.8 Because of their small sizes
and large surface areas, PM2.5 can enter deep into the
pulmonary alveoli along with adsorbed toxic components.9 Once inhaled and deposited into the lungs, PM2.5 can induce oxidative stress and local inflammation by activating
stress kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), especially
after being phagocytosed by pulmonary macrophages, which can generate
and release various proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6
(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).10 These
cytokines are important signaling molecules that respond to environmental
stress and can enter the blood, resulting in systemic inflammation.11 The proinflammatory effects are probably attributed
to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), transition metals, and
endotoxins in PM2.5.10

Epidemiological studies have found a significant association between
PM2.5 exposure and increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome-originated
diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus.3,12 Moreover,
exposure to PM2.5 in mice could lead to abnormal glucose
metabolism and insulin resistance,13,14 which are
fundamental for metabolic syndrome. The underlying molecular mechanism
is not fully understood; however, several proinflammatory cytokines
have been proposed as causative factors of insulin resistance in insulin
target cells, such as hepatocytes and skeletal muscle cells.15,16 In combination with the evidence that exposure to PM2.5 can induce proinflammatory cytokine expression, particularly in
alveolar macrophages,17−19 we hypothesized that macrophages could mediate the
effects of ambient PM2.5 on insulin resistance in hepatocytes
via the generation and release of proinflammatory cytokines.

PM2.5 pollution is a severe environmental issue throughout
China,20 particularly in metropolitan regions.
For instance, in Beijing, the capital of China, with ∼21 million
inhabitants, the annual PM2.5 level reached 80.6 μg
m–3 in 2015,21 which
was ∼2.3-fold greater than the recommended Interim Target-1
level set by the WHO. Furthermore, distinctive seasonal variations
in the PM2.5 concentration and composition based on source
have been reported.22,23 As we have demonstrated previously,
PM2.5 samples collected in winter contained much higher
levels of PAHs and its derivatives than did those collected in summer
in Beijing.24 However, there is limited
information on the proinflammatory and possible downstream effects
(e.g., on insulin target cells) of PM2.5 from Beijing,
which is composed of various toxic components.

To test the hypothesis
that the macrophage-mediated effect of PM2.5 on hepatic
insulin resistance is dependent on its chemical
composition, we designed a serial in vitro study and exposed mouse
macrophages to PM2.5 collected during summer and winter
from Beijing, which represented different sources and chemical compositions.
Thereafter, we explored the effects of a macrophage-conditioned medium
(CM) on insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and the underlying
insulin signaling pathway in mouse hepatocytes. This will help clarify
the mechanisms that link PM2.5 exposure to insulin resistance
and further explore the influencing factors on this effect, especially
the sources and chemical composition of PM2.5.

The mouse macrophage cell line
(Ana-1) was purchased from the cell culture center at the Shanghai
Institutes for Life Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The
mouse hepatocyte cell line (NCTC clone 1469) was acquired from the

purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The glucose oxidase
method kit, protein quantification kit, RIPA buffer, sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer,
and Super ECL Plus solution were purchased from Applygene (Beijing,
China). Antibodies against insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), phosphorylated
IRS1 (pIRS1), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), phosphorylated protein kinase
B (pAKT), forkhead box transcription factor O1 (FoxO1), phosphorylated
FoxO1 (pFoxO1), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), phosphorylated

JNK (pJNK), and β-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA). Finally, the secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG, from ZSGB-BIO (Beijing, China),
was used in the study.

PM2.5 Collection and Preparation
PM2.5 was collected at the Peking University Atmosphere
Environmental
Monitoring Station in Beijing, China (39°59′21″N,
116°18′25″E, ∼30 m above ground level).
PM2.5 was collected daily on Whatman Teflon filters (diameter
47 mm; Clifton, NJ), using a TH-16A Ambient Particulate Sampler (Tianhong
Instruments, Wuhan, China), at a flow rate of 16.7 L min–1, from July 10 to August 4, 2013 (summer), and from December 2 to
December 24, 2013 (winter).
After sampling, the filters were stored in the dark at −20
°C until extraction. The PM2.5 on the filters was
prepared following a previous method, with modifications.25 Briefly, each filter was sonicated three times
for 30 min each using sterilized water in an ice bath. The extracts
were pooled by season and lyophilized in a vacuum freeze dryer. Then,
the particles were weighed, resuspended at 10 mg mL–1 in sterilized water, and stored in the dark at −80 °C.
The stock PM2.5 solution was sonicated briefly before dilution
for the cell exposure experiments.

Cell Culture and Exposure
Ana-1 macrophages were grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin at 37
°C and 5% CO2. At 80–90% confluency, the cells
were passaged using trypsin–EDTA, cultured in 12-well plates
at a concentration of 500 000 cells mL–1,
and incubated for 12 h to adhere. After overnight serum starvation,
the cells were exposed to 20 μg cm–2 (∼80
μg mL–1) summer or winter PM2.5 in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin for 3–12
h. After exposure, the culture medium was separated via centrifugation
at 5000g for 5 min to eliminate residual cells and
particles, and the supernatant was collected as the summer or winter
CM.

NCTC 1469 hepatic cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated donor equine serum and penicillin/streptomycin
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At 80–90% confluency,
the cells were seeded in plates at a concentration of 500 000
cells mL–1 and incubated for 12 h to adhere. After
serum starvation, the cells were treated with summer or winter CM
for 3 h. Next, the CM was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 100
nM bovine insulin and penicillin/streptomycin and incubated for 1
h for the assessment of glucose consumption or for 10 min for western
blot analysis.

Gene Expression
Total RNA was extracted
from Ana-1
cells using the TRIzol reagent, and the RNA was reverse-transcribed
to generate cDNA using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit. The relative
expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in Ana-1 cells were
quantified using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. The two-step polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) cycle was as follows: initial denaturation at
95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for
15 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. The relative
gene expression levels obtained by quantitative real-time reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in each group were calculated using the
2–ΔΔCT method following normalization
to β-actin. The primers used for the measured genes are listed
in Table 1.

Cytokine Release
The levels of proinflammatory cytokines
IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in the CM were measured using CBA as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the culture medium
supernatant was incubated with capture beads for 1 h, followed by
incubation with PE-detecting reagents for 1 h at room temperature
in the dark. The beads were washed and resuspended in 300 μL
washing buffer for flow cytometric analysis (FACSVerse; BD Biosciences).
The acquired data were analyzed using FCAP Array software (BD Biosciences).

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement
The ROS levels
in NCTC 1469 cells were measured using the fluorescent probe DHR 123.
After treatment with CM or DMEM, the probe solution at a final concentration
of 10 μM was spiked into the culture medium, and the cells were
incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark, followed by two washes
with PBS. Finally, the cells were dissociated using trypsin–EDTA
solution and resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS. The samples were analyzed
using a BD FACSVerse flow cytometer at excitation/emission wavelengths
of 488/530 nm. For each sample, 10 000 events were acquired.

Glucose Consumption
After treatment with CM or DMEM,
the NCTC 1469 cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with 100
nM bovine insulin and penicillin/streptomycin for 1 h. The glucose
concentration was measured using the glucose oxidase method kit. Hepatocyte
glucose consumption was obtained by subtracting the glucose concentration
obtained from the wells with cells from that in blank wells.26

Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis
NCTC 1469
cells were washed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer containing phosphatase
and proteinase inhibitors at 4 °C. After boiling for 5 min, the
harvested proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked in
5% BSA buffer for 1 h and then blotted with the primary antibody (anti-IRS1,
anti-pIRS1, anti-AKT, anti-pAKT, anti-FoxO1, anti-pFoxO1, anti-GSK3β,
anti-pGSK3β, anti-JNK1/2, anti-pJNK1/2, and anti-β-actin)
at 4 °C for 12 h and the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for
1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were developed using
the Super ECL Plus Western blotting detection system, and images of
the immunoreactive bands were acquired using the ChemiDoc XRS System
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The integrated band densities were measured
using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, USA).

Statistical
Analysis
Data are presented as means ±
standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least three parallel experiments.
Differences between groups were tested by using Student’s t-test, and p < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted
using SPSS (ver. 16.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Results
Inflammatory
Cytokine Expression and Release in Macrophages
As pulmonary
cells such as macrophages and alveolar epithelial
cells are the first cells to respond to inhaled PM2.5,
we determined the capacity of PM2.5 to activate macrophages
by measuring the expression of representative proinflammatory cytokines,
including IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1. PM2.5 induced IL-6,
TNF-α, and MCP-1 expression in Ana-1 cells in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 1a–c).
Significant increases in the IL-6 and MCP-1 mRNA levels were observed
in PM2.5-treated Ana-1 cells at 3 h, especially those exposed
to winter PM2.5. The IL-6 mRNA levels remained unchanged
after 6 h of incubation but decreased by 12 h. Similar alterations
were observed in the MCP-1 mRNA levels. The TNF-α mRNA levels
were higher in summer PM2.5-treated cells at 3 and 6 h,
whereas no difference was observed at 12 h. This indicated an acute
and short response to PM2.5 for Ana-1. Therefore, we measured
the secretion of the corresponding proteins after a 3 h incubation.
Both summer and winter PM2.5 induced an increase in the
release of IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 into the Ana-1 culture medium
(Figure 1d). Macrophages
exposed to winter PM2.5 showed a greater increase in TNF-α
release, followed by IL-6 and MCP-1, compared to those treated with
summer PM2.5.

ROS Generation and Glucose
Consumption in Hepatocytes
Oxidative stress has been reported
to induce insulin resistance in
hepatocytes and muscle cells.27,28 In this study, we measured
intracellular ROS levels in NCTC 1469 cells. Both summer and, especially,
winter CMs enhanced ROS production significantly compared to that
in the cells exposed to DMEM or the control CM (Figure 2a).

ROS levels and (b)
insulin-stimulated glucose consumption in NCTC 1469 cells. C-CM, S-CM,
and W-CM represent control, summer, and winter CMs, respectively.
Values are expressed as means ± SEM of five to six independent
experiments. **p < 0.01.

Glucose consumption was examined to investigate the insulin
sensitivity
of NCTC 1469 hepatocytes. Hepatocytes pretreated with winter CM had
a significantly lower glucose consumption than that of the other three
groups (Figure 2b),
whereas no significant differences were found among DMEM-, control
CM-, or summer CM-exposed hepatocytes. This indicated that exposure
to winter CM decreased the insulin sensitivity in NCTC 1469 cells.

Alteration of the Insulin Signaling Pathway
Glycometabolism
is regulated mainly by the insulin signaling pathway.29 To explore the underlying mechanism of decreased glucose
consumption in winter CM-treated hepatocytes, we assessed key molecules
of the insulin signaling pathway. The results are shown in Figure 3. In winter CM-exposed
hepatocytes, the phosphorylation ratio of IRS1 at Ser307 increased,
which could lead to suppressed normal insulin signaling.30 A decreased ratio of phosphorylated AKT (Ser473)/total
AKT was observed in winter CM-treated cells, likely as a result of
IRS1 phosphorylation, as AKT is a vital kinase in the insulin pathway
downstream of IRS1.31 Similarly, the phosphorylation
ratio of FoxO1 (Ser256), a kinase downstream of the insulin signaling
cascade, was decreased significantly. Given that FoxO1 inhibits gluconeogenesis,
inhibiting the phosphorylation of FoxO1 could enhance gluconeogenesis,32 which is a characteristic feature of insulin
resistance. For GSK3β, a key regulator of glycogen synthesis,33 no significant differences in the ratio of phosphorylated
(Ser9) versus total GSK3β were observed.

of phosphorylated and total IRS1, AKT,
FoxO1, GSK3β, and JNK1/2 and (b) their levels in hepatocytes
treated with DMEM, control CM (C-CM), summer CM (S-CM), and winter
CM (W-CM). Values are expressed as means ± SEM of three independent
experiments. *p < 0.05.

Suppression of normal insulin pathway could be triggered
by the
activation of certain stress kinases, like MAPKs. In fact, JNK, a
major subset of MAPKs, comprising JNK1 and JNK2,34 showed higher phosphorylation levels in winter CM-treated
hepatocytes, indicating activation of this stress kinase.

On
the basis of the results, we proposed a mechanism of hepatic
insulin resistance induced by exposure to medium conditioned by macrophages
treated with winter PM2.5 (Figure 4).

Discussion
PM
pollution is a significant risk factor for human health worldwide,
especially PM2.5, which can be inhaled along with absorbed
toxic components and deposited in the lungs.9 Recent epidemiological studies have identified an association between
PM2.5 exposure and increased incidence of metabolic syndrome-related
diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus.3,4 In
addition, an in vivo experiment revealed elevated fasting blood glucose
levels and insulin resistance in mice exposed to urban PM2.5.14 Such adverse health effects have been
proposed to be initiated via oxidative stress and systemic inflammation
after PM2.5 exposure and could be modified by the chemical
composition of PM.11 To test this hypothesis,
we explored the effects of PM2.5 collected during summer
and winter in Beijing, which differed in their main sources and chemical
compositions, on the insulin sensitivity of hepatocytes in serial
in vitro experiments.

Pulmonary cells, such as macrophages and
alveolar epithelial cells,
are among the first to respond to inhaled particles; therefore, we
exposed macrophages to PM2.5. After incubation for 3 h,
the intracellular mRNA levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 were increased, although
the TNF-α mRNA levels in winter PM2.5-treated macrophages
remained unchanged (Figure 1a–c). The levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 secreted
into the culture medium were higher in PM2.5-treated macrophages
than those in controls. In particular, macrophages exposed to winter
PM2.5 showed a greater increase in IL-6, TNF-α, and
MCP-1 release compared to those treated with summer PM2.5, indicating that winter PM2.5 was more cytotoxic to macrophages
(Figure 1d). This was
in agreement with the half maximal inhibitory concentration results
for winter PM2.5 (45.6 μg cm–2)
and summer PM2.5 (209 μg cm–2; Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This
differed from the results obtained for several European cities, which
suggested that summer PM2.5 induced higher levels of IL-6
release in rat macrophages than did winter PM2.5.17 However, Pozzi et al. found
that RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages released higher levels of TNF-α
after incubation with winter PM2.5 than those on incubation
with summer PM2.5 from Rome.18

The difference in cytotoxicity between summer and winter PM2.5 could be attributed, at least partly, to their chemical
compositions. In fact, a higher concentration of secondary components,
such as NH4+, SO42+, and
NO3–, was found in the summer PM2.5 solution (Figure S1), whereas
the winter PM2.5 solution contained more primary components
like K+, a marker for the primary source of biomass burning.
Other components,
such as organics, were not measured in the present study; however,
in a previous study, we found that winter PM2.5 contained
more toxic organic components due to primary emissions from coal and
biomass burning in the urban and neighboring regions of Beijing.24 The levels of PM2.5-bound PAHs and
nitrated, hydroxylated, and oxygenated derivatives were much higher
during winters than during summers at the same site. The benzo(a)pyrene
(BaP)-based toxic equivalency (BaPeq) of PM2.5-bound PAHs during winters (median, 0.44 ng BaPeq/μg
PM2.5) was 12.5-fold higher than that during summers (median,
0.035 ng BaPeq/μg PM2.5), suggesting that
winter PM2.5 could be more toxic.24

Studies have suggested that inhaled PM2.5 has effects
on tissues and organs beyond the respiratory system.11 In humans, the liver is the primary organ responsible for
glucose and lipid metabolism.29 After stimulation
by insulin, hepatocytes accelerate the glucose consumption rate by
triggering the insulin signaling pathway. To simulate this condition,
CM was used to model the association between PM2.5-activated
macrophages and hepatocyte responses. Although neither summer CM nor
winter CM
exposure significantly affected hepatocyte viability compared to that
on exposure to the DMEM control (Figure S3), increased ROS levels were observed, particularly in cells exposed
to winter CM (Figure 2a). Previous studies have suggested that proinflammatory cytokines,
such as TNF-α, can induce hepatocellular ROS generation by activating
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase.35 Therefore, the increased ROS production in the hepatocytes
was probably due to high proinflammatory cytokine levels, especially
after winter CM exposure.

Meanwhile, compared with DMEM, control,
or summer CM, winter CM
reduced the insulin-stimulated glucose consumption in hepatocytes
(Figure 2b), suggesting
impairment of the insulin signaling pathway. In glucoregulation, normal
insulin signaling begins with autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor
(IR), followed by phosphorylation of IRS1 at several tyrosine residues
and phosphorylation of the downstream protein kinase, AKT.27 IRS1 phosphorylation of serine residues (e.g.,
Ser307 and Ser1101) can interfere with tyrosine residue phosphorylation
and thus inhibit IRS1-mediated insulin signaling.30,36,37 For example, Zheng et al. reported that
ambient PM2.5 induced IRS1 phosphorylation at Ser636 and
Ser1101, impairing hepatic glucose metabolism in mice.14 In this study, we found increased IRS1 phosphorylation
at Ser307 in hepatocytes exposed to winter CM, followed by decreased
phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473, which confirmed suppression of the
IRS1–AKT signaling pathway.

Downstream of the IRS1–AKT
signaling cascade, insulin-stimulated
FoxO1 phosphorylation is an essential step in gluconeogenesis inhibition.
FoxO1 is part of the forkhead transcription factor family and is a
substrate of AKT in hepatocytes. Furthermore, it mediates glucose-6-phosphatase
(G6Pase) transcription by binding to its CAAAACAA sequence. Phosphorylation
of FoxO1 via AKT stimulation can promote nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation
and degradation of FoxO1, which can result in lower G6Pase expression
and suppression of gluconeogenesis.36 In
this study, hepatocytes treated with winter CM showed attenuated FoxO1
phosphorylation, which confirmed the suppression effect of winter
CM on IRS1-mediated insulin signaling and explained the reduced glucose
consumption observed. By contrast, no significant changes were observed
in hepatocytes treated with summer CM, indicating that differences
in chemical composition affected macrophage responses directly and
impacted hepatocytes distinctly.

Inflammatory cytokines, such
as IL-6 and TNF-α, have been
demonstrated to induce insulin resistance in insulin target cells
by binding to the corresponding receptors in the cell membrane and
activating downstream regulatory proteins, such as JNK.35 JNK proteins belong to the MAPK family and have
three isoforms: JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. JNK1 and JNK2 are broadly expressed
in cells, including hepatocytes.34 Activating
JNK increases IRS1 phosphorylation at serine residues, thereby impairing
insulin signaling.30 In addition to inflammatory
cytokines, ROS have been reported to induce JNK1/2 activation in hepatocytes.35 As proposed in Figure 4, impaired insulin signaling and glucose
consumption in the winter CM-treated hepatocytes might be a result
of the enhanced JNK1/2 activation in this study (Figure 4).

In conclusion, using
an in vitro CM system, we found that winter
PM2.5 from Beijing induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes,
probably due to the high levels of toxic components in PM2.5 during the winter. These preliminary results provided a potential
mechanism linking PM2.5 exposure to the insulin resistance
of hepatocytes and thus contributed to our understanding of the systemic
toxicity of PM, including its role in metabolic syndrome-related diseases,
such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nonetheless, it should pointed out
that the extraction process could change the surface properties and
shape of PM2.5; therefore, further in vitro studies with
air–liquid interface exposure devices and in vivo mammal exposure
experiments are warranted to identify the main components in PM2.5 that contribute to its inflammatory effects and insulin
resistance, which is essential for controlling this important air
pollutant.
