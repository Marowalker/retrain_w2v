Control over TiO2 rutile
crystal growth and morphology
using additives is essential for the development of functional materials.
Computer simulation studies on the thermodynamically stable conformations
of additives at the surfaces of rutile crystals contribute to understanding
the mechanisms underlying this control. In this study, a metadynamics
method was combined with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate
the thermodynamically stable conformations of glycolate, lactate,
and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions at the {001} and {110} planes of rutile
crystals. Two simple atom–atom distances were selected as collective
variables for the metadynamics method. At the {001} plane, a conformation
in which the COO– group was oriented toward the
surface was found to be the most stable for the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate
ions, whereas a conformation in which the COO– group
was oriented toward water was the most stable for the glycolate ion.
At the {110} plane, a conformation in which the COO– group was oriented toward the surface was the most stable for all
three hydroxylate ions, and a second most stable conformation was
also observed for the lactate ion at positions close to the {110}
plane. For all three hydroxylate ions (α-hydroxycarboxylate
ions), the stability of the most stable conformation was higher for
the {110} plane than for the {001} plane. At both planes, the stability
of the most stable conformation was highest for the 2-hydroxybutyrate
ion and lowest for the glycolate ion. Supposing that all three hydroxylate
ions serve to decrease the surface free energy at the rutile surface
and that a more stable conformation at the rutile surface leads to
a greater decrease in the surface free energy, the present results
partially explain experimentally observed differences in the changes
in growth rate and morphology of rutile crystals in the presence of
glycolic, lactic, and 2-hydroxybutyric acids.

Introduction
Control over crystal
growth and morphology is essential for the
development of functional materials because the functionality of crystals
depends on their size and shape. The use of additives is a promising
method for achieving such control, and a diverse range of additives
have been applied, such as peptides, amino acids, alcohols, and metal
ions. In general, the binding of additives to a crystal surface changes
the growth rate at that surface, and anisotropy in the binding of
additives between different crystal planes changes the morphology.1 Therefore, when considering the use of a particular
additive to control crystal growth or morphology, it is important
to investigate the thermodynamically stable conformations of the additives
at various crystal surfaces. Although certain experimental techniques,
such as infrared spectroscopy2 and solid-state
NMR,3 can reveal information about the
conformations of additives at wide crystal surfaces, the detailed
conformations and dynamics of additives at specific planes of crystals
grown in solution are difficult to determine experimentally.

Computer simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD), are helpful
tools for investigating the stable conformations of additives at crystal
surfaces. To date, MD simulations have been conducted to examine the
stable conformations of additives at the surfaces of several inorganic
crystals, such as CaCO34−8 and TiO2.1,9−25 Several previous MD simulation studies of these inorganic crystals
have discussed the thermodynamic stabilities of a few selected conformations
by calculating the potential of mean force.16,17,20

The run of an MD simulation is typically
on the order of a microsecond
or less. Such a short run time is not always sufficient to reproduce
all of the possible conformations of an additive at a crystal surface,
especially for large additives possessing a complex structure. Ideally,
the thermodynamically stable conformations of an additive at a crystal
surface should be determined definitively by comparing the free energies
of all possible conformations. In addition, to elucidate the effects
of additives on crystal growth and morphology, their conformations
on all possible exposed facets should be considered. It is impossible
to estimate the free energies of all possible conformations on exposed
facets using an MD simulation with a short run. Calculating the potential
of mean force for all possible conformations on each facet is extremely
time-consuming, if the number of possible conformations is large.

Metadynamics (MTD)26 is a method for
enhancing the transition of a system between different states in an
MD simulation by increasing the probability of reaching high-energy
states. The MTD method affords a free-energy landscape that represents
the thermodynamic stabilities of all possible states of a system.
Thus, if the MTD method is combined with an MD simulation of an additive
at a crystal surface, the thermodynamic stabilities of all possible
conformations can be determined definitively, even if the run of the
simulation is not very long. The applicability of the MTD method to
investigating the stable conformation of an additive at a crystal
plane has been confirmed in recent simulation studies.25,27 However, to the best of our knowledge, the MTD method has not yet
been applied to investigate the anisotropy in the stable conformation
of an additive between different crystal planes to infer the mechanism
of crystal growth or morphology control.

In this study, we used
the MTD method to examine the thermodynamically
stable conformations of hydroxylate ions at the {001} and {110} planes
of a TiO2 rutile crystal. TiO2 is a highly functional
material,28−33 and the functionality of TiO2 crystals depends on their
size and shape.34−46 Rutile crystals are the most thermodynamically stable polymorph
of TiO2 and have been widely employed in practical applications.47−52 Thus, the use of additives to control the growth and morphology
of rutile crystals is an important area of research for the development
of functional materials.

Kobayashi et al. reported that the
growth of rutile crystals in
the presence of hydroxy acids (α-hydroxycarboxy acids), such
as glycolic acid,47−49 lactic acid,52 and 2-hydroxybutyric
acid,52 resulted in a higher growth rate
at the rutile crystal surface and an increase in the {110} area ratio
compared with that for the equilibrium shape, which is a tetragonal
prism bounded by {110} planes and terminated by a pair of tetragonal
pyramids bounded by {101} planes.53−55 The authors speculated
that the increased growth rate originated from the binding of hydroxylate
ions (α-hydroxycarboxylate ions) at the rutile crystal surface
and the increased {110} area ratio originated from the anisotropic
binding of the ions between different crystal planes.1,47,55 Since the increase in the {110} area ratio
was caused by an increase in the growth rate at the {001} planes of
rutile crystals,50 we previously performed
MD simulations of a glycolate ion at the {001} and {110} planes of
a rutile crystal.24 The results suggested
a difference in the stable conformation between the two planes, which
was considered to be related to the experimental results reported
by Kobayashi et al. Detailed knowledge regarding the difference in
the stable conformations between different planes of a rutile crystal
for various hydroxylate ions obtained using the MTD method would be
expected to significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms
of crystal growth and morphology control of actual rutile crystals
in the presence of hydroxy acids.

The purpose of this study
was to evaluate the applicability of
the MTD method to studying the mechanisms of crystal growth and morphology
control using additives. In this paper, we demonstrate that the difference
in the stable conformations of glycolate, lactate, and 2-hydroxybutyrate
ions between the {001} and {110} planes, which were analyzed using
the MTD method, partially explains the experimentally observed differences
in the growth rate and morphology of rutile crystals grown in the
presence of hydroxy acids, namely, glycolic, lactic, and 2-hydroxybutyric
acids.

It has been debated whether water molecules on the surfaces
of
rutile crystals are dissociated.56−65 Recently, Wang et al. indicated that an isolated water molecule
on the rutile {110} plane was dissociated.58 Kang et al. reported that the dissociation of water molecules at
the rutile crystal surface can change the adsorption conformation
of a protein molecule.59 In contrast, González
et al. demonstrated that if water molecules on the rutile surface
formed a molecular layer, the layer structure in which no water molecules
are dissociated was energetically stable for the {110} and {011} planes.57 In this study, we used a rigid water molecule
model by assuming that water molecules at the rutile surface were
not dissociated. Simulations in which the dissociation of water molecules
is allowed, such as first-principles MD simulations, are needed to
confirm this assumption. However, the purpose of the present simulations
was qualitative elucidation of the differences in the stable conformations
of hydroxylate ions between different rutile planes. In this paper,
we demonstrate that, as with earlier simulation studies that used
a rigid water molecule model,12,14,18,24 the present simulation results
are qualitatively in good agreement with previous experimental investigations.47−49,52

Simulation Method
Potential Models
The potential models used in this
study were the same as those used in our previous study.24 The interactions acting on Ti and O in the rutile
crystal were estimated using the potential model proposed by Matsui
and Akaogi.66 This model reproduces Ti–O
bond lengths in the bulk and on the surface of the rutile crystal
and is therefore suitable for the present study. The potential parameters
for the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions were determined using a
general AMBER force field (GAFF).67 The
charge on each atom of the hydroxylate ions was determined using ANTECHAMBER,68 which is an extensively used module for determining
the parameters in the input files needed to execute an MD simulation
using a GAFF. Since the potential parameters for the GAFF were optimized
using the TIP3P model,69 the interaction
between a pair of water molecules was also estimated using the TIP3P
model.

The potential parameters of the glycolate ion were already
determined using the GAFF in the previous study.24 However, in that study, the charge on each atom of the
glycolate ion was determined such that the minimum-energy structure
generated using the GAFF corresponded to the optimum structure obtained
via first-principles calculations without using ANTECHAMBER.24 In the present study, to impartially evaluate
the relative stabilities of the conformations of the three hydroxylate
ions at the rutile surface, the simulation of the glycolate ion was
conducted using the charge on each atom, which was redetermined using
ANTECHAMBER in the present study, and the parameters for bond potentials,
valence angle potentials, dihedral angle potentials, and Lennard-Jones
potentials, which were determined in our previous study.24 The minimum-energy structures of the hydroxylate
ions, which were obtained via first-principles calculations using
the MP2 method with the 6-311+G** basis function, are presented in Figure 1, and the atomic
charge values determined for each hydroxylate ion using ANTECHAMBER
are listed in Table S1.

Figure 1 Minimum-energy structures
of the glycolate, lactate, and 2-hydroxybutyrate
ions.

As in our previous study,24 the interactions
between rutile and the hydroxylate ions were determined via the same
method as that used by Carravetta and Monti.11 Briefly, the interaction energy between a TiO5H6 cluster with the same structure as a rutile crystal, which was used
instead of a rutile crystal, and the hydroxylate ion was evaluated
for different intermolecular distances via first-principles calculations
using the MP2 method with the 6-311+G** basis function. These calculations
were performed for two different orientations of each hydroxylate
ion. Then, the calculated interaction energies were fitted to a potential
function, which was assumed to be a Coulomb potential plus a Buckingham
potential. The values of the Buckingham potential parameters for the
lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions are listed in Table S2, and those for the glycolate ion were provided in
our previous paper.24

Simulation
Systems
Two simulation systems, namely,
a system for the simulation of the {001} plane (the {001} system)
and a system for the simulation of the {110} plane (the {110} system),
were established as in our previous study.24 Each system was a rectangular parallelepiped consisting of a rutile
crystal containing 2016 TiO2 units, a water phase containing
3000 H2O molecules, and a vapor phase. The rutile crystal
was placed at the center of the system such that each of the two crystal
planes was perpendicular to the z-axis of the system.
A single hydroxylate ion was placed in the water phase, which was
juxtaposed to one of the two crystal planes, and the remainder of
the system was the vapor phase.

The system dimensions were 38.8
× 45.0 × 140.0 Å3 for the {001} system and
35.4 × 38.8 × 140.0 Å3 for the {110} system.
The dimensions in the x and y directions
were determined from a separate MD simulation of a bulk rutile crystal
at 298 K and 1 atm. The thickness of the rutile crystal in the z direction was 35.4 Å for the {001} system and 45.0
Å for the {110} system and that of the water phase was approximately
50 Å for the {001} system and 64 Å for the {110} system.
A schematic illustration of the simulation system and the structures
of the rutile surface in each system are depicted in Figure S1. As each hydroxylate ion had a charge of −e, a Na+ ion was added to the vacuum phase to
maintain the system in an electrically neutral state. The position
of the Na+ ion was fixed at the center of the x–y plane at a distance of 3 Å in the z direction from the crystal plane that was not adjacent
to the water phase. In this study, the position of the crystal plane
in each system was defined as the position of the outermost O atom
layer of the rutile crystal in the z direction.

The surface energy, γ, of each plane was estimated using
the following equation 1  Here, Usurf and Ubulk are
the potential energies of the system
including the rutile crystal only and a bulk rutile crystal comprising
the same number of TiO2 units, respectively, and S is the surface area of one side of the rutile crystal
in the system. The estimated γ values were 0.148 eV/Å2 for the {001} system and 0.121 eV/Å2 for
the {110} system, indicating that the structure of the {110} plane
was more stable than that of the {001} plane. The absolute values
of γ in the present potential model were greater than the values
obtained via density functional theory calculations.57,65,70 However, we confirmed that the
relative stabilities of the structures of the {001} and {110} planes
were satisfactorily reproduced by the present potential model.65,70

MTD Method
The MTD method is an enhanced sampling method
that increases the probability of visiting high free-energy states
by adding a bias potential, which is a function of several collective
variables (CVs), to the minima of the potential energy surface of
the system.26 Selecting appropriate CVs
is crucial for obtaining a desirable free-energy landscape for a system
of interest. In this study, two CVs were chosen, namely, the distance
between the C1 atom and the surface, d_C1, and that
between the C2 atom and the surface, d_C2. These
CVs were selected because they permitted the convenient determination
of the thermodynamically stable orientation and position of the hydroxylate
ion on each plane. In a similar manner to the present study, YazdanYar
et al. investigated the binding conformations of amino acids at a
rutile {110} plane using two CVs, that is, the distances between pairs
of centers of mass for different atomic groups.25 In this paper, we demonstrate that the present CVs of simple
atom–atom distances are sufficient for determining the stable
binding conformation of an additive at a crystal surface.

With
reference to earlier studies,25,27,71,72 the well-tempered MTD method73 was used to obtain the free-energy landscape
with sufficiently high accuracy.73 The
bias factor parameter in the well-tempered MTD method was set to 5.

Computations
The Newton’s equations of motion
for each atom of the TiO2 units, water molecules, and hydroxylate
ion were integrated with a time step of 1 fs using a leapfrog algorithm.74 The temperature was maintained at 298 K by means
of a Berendsen thermostat with a coupling parameter of 0.1 ps.75 The C–H and O–H distances of each
hydroxylate ion were kept constant at their equilibrium values using
the SHAKE algorithm.76 An MD simulation
combined with the MTD method was performed using DL_POLY 2.20,77 in which PLUMED 1.378 was implemented.

The long-range Coulomb interactions were
estimated using the Ewald method, and the short-range Lennard-Jones
and Buckingham interactions were cut off at an interatomic distance
of 10 Å. The accuracy of the potential energy and force calculated
using the Ewald method was set to 10–6. The real
space cutoff distance was set to 10 Å. The Ewald convergence
parameter was 0.3208 Å–1. The maximum indices
of the reciprocal lattice vector in the x, y, and z directions for the reciprocal
space sum were 13, 15, and 42, respectively, for the {001} system
and 12, 13, and 45, respectively, for the {110} system.

The
bias potential for the MTD method was represented as a function
of Gaussians. The height of the Gaussians was set to 0.03 kBT, and the sigma parameter
of the Gaussians was set to 0.35 Å. The bias potential was added
to the Hamiltonian of the system at every 100 MD steps. The total
run of the MD simulation was 12 ns, which was sufficiently long to
determine the free-energy landscape because the CVs frequently changed
within their entire ranges during the run (Figure S2). This run of 12 ns was considerably shorter than the total
run of the MD simulation in the previous study (30 ns).24 As we focused only on the stable binding conformations
at the rutile surface, the variable range of each CV was restricted
to the region near the surface by setting the directive UWALL in PLUMED
1.3 to CV = 8 Å. It is known that the Buckingham potential function
generates a spurious maximum at a short interatomic distance and sharply
decreases to negative potential energies as the interatomic distance
approaches zero.79 Therefore, if a particular
atom of the hydroxylate ion became too close to the rutile surface
when the MTD method searched for a high free-energy state, the force
acting on a particular atom of the hydroxylate ion may be extremely
large, causing computation errors, such as the convergence error of
the SHAKE algorithm.77 To avoid such errors,
we also set the directive LWALL to CV = 3 Å. These directives
produced the following external wall potential, Vwall, acting on the system 2  Here, Δs was the distance
between the positions s (d_C1 ≥
8 Å and d_C2 ≥ 8 Å for UWALL and d_C1 ≤ 3 Å and d_C2 ≤
3 Å for LWALL) and slimit on the d_C1–d_C2 plane. slimit was (8 Å, 8 Å) for UWALL and (3 Å,
3 Å) for LWALL. The energy constant κ and rescaling factor
ε were set to 1 kJ/mol and 1 Å, respectively. p was set to 4, such that Vwall gradually
increased with increasing |s – slimit|.

Notably, the free energy at each CV, which
was computed in this
study, was the difference from the free energy at the upper level
of the deposited bias potentials in the space of the CVs, ΔF. Thus, the relative free energy between different CVs
is meaningful rather than the absolute value of the free energy at
each CV. We confirmed the reliability of the relative free energy
between different CVs by comparing the free-energy landscapes, which
were created using the simulation data for various periods in the
simulation (Figure S3). In this study,
we assumed that the upper level of the deposited bias potentials was
equivalent for the simulations of both the {001} and {110} systems.

Simulation Results
Glycolate Ion
First, we examined
the binding conformation
of the glycolate ion to confirm that the present method properly provides
the stable conformation of a hydroxylate ion at a rutile surface. Figure 2 shows the free-energy
landscapes along the d_C1 and d_C2
axes for the glycolate ion conformation. The free-energy minima appeared
at (d_C1, d_C2) = (5.8 Å, 4.7
Å) for the {001} plane and (3.9 Å, 5.0 Å) for the {110}
plane. These results indicate that the conformation in which the COO– group was oriented toward water corresponded to the
free-energy minimum for the {001} plane, whereas the conformation
in which the COO– group was oriented toward the
rutile surface corresponded to the free-energy minimum for the {110}
plane. These most stable conformations are the same as those indicated
by our previous MD simulation study,24 thus
confirming the applicability of the present method to studying the
stable conformation of a hydroxylate ion at a rutile surface. The
lower value of the free-energy minimum for the {110} plane (−51.02
kJ/mol) than for the {001} plane (−50.11 kJ/mol) indicates
that the stability of the most stable conformation was greater for
the {110} plane than for the {001} plane. The lower free-energy minimum
for the {110} plane than for the {001} plane is also consistent with
the lower potential energy between the glycolate ions of the rutile
crystal for the {110} plane than for the {001} plane, which was indicated
by our previous MD simulation study.24

Figure 2 Free-energy
landscapes for the conformation of the glycolate ion
at the {001} and {110} planes. The left- and right-hand panels in
the upper part of the figure show snapshots of a typical conformation
corresponding to the free-energy minimum, (d_C1, d_C2) = (5.8 Å, 4.7 Å) for the {001} plane and
(3.9 Å, 5.0 Å) for the {110} plane, with and without the
hydrogen-bonded networks of water molecules (white rods), respectively.
The yellow, red, dark gray, and white spheres represent the Ti, O,
C, and H atoms, respectively. Water molecules are not shown in the
snapshots.

The free-energy landscape for
the {001} plane also indicated a
second free-energy minimum at (4.3 Å, 4.6 Å) corresponding
to the second most stable conformation, in which the COO– group was oriented toward the rutile surface. This conformation
was not observed in our previous MD simulation.24 The free energy at the ridge between the minimum and second
minimum (−48.39 kJ/mol) was only 1.72 kJ/mol higher than that
at the minimum and only 1.32 kJ/mol higher than that at the second
minimum. This result implies that transitions between the most stable
and second most stable conformations may occur frequently at the {001}
plane.

Figure 3 presents
the number density (ρ) profiles of the O (O in TiO2), Ow (O of water molecule), Oc (carboxyl O of the hydroxylate ion),
Oh (hydroxyl O of the hydroxylate ion), and Ho (hydroxyl H of the
hydroxylate ion) atoms of the glycolate ion along the z direction. The distinct peaks appearing in the ρ profiles
of the Oc, Oh, and Ho atoms originated from the stable conformation
of the glycolate ion at the rutile plane. It can be seen that the
glycolate ion was separated from the surface by a layered structure
of water present on the surface. This result is consistent with our
previous MD simulation, in which indirect binding of the glycolate
ion to the rutile plane led to greater stability than direct binding.24

Figure 3 Number density (ρ) profiles of the O, Ow, Oc, Oh,
and Ho
atoms of the glycolate ion along the z direction.
The positions of the first and second layers of water molecules for
the {001} plane and the first, second, and third layers of water molecules
for the {110} plane are indicated by red arrows. The origin of the z-axis is the outermost layer of O atoms in the rutile crystal.

The layered structures of water
at each rutile plane, which were
obtained via MD simulations of each system without including the hydroxylate
ion and Na+ ion,24 are depicted
in Figure S4. The layered structure of
water can also be observed in the snapshot shown in Figure 2. The Oc or Oh atom of the
glycolate ion in the stable conformation was located at the positions
of the Ow atoms in the second layer of water molecules at z = 4 Å for the {001} plane and in the third layer
of water molecules at z = 3.4 Å for the {110}
plane. The longer distance between the outermost O atoms at the surface
and the position at which the free-energy minimum appeared for the
{001} plane than for the {110} plane originated from the longer distance
between the surface and the second layer of water molecules for the
{001} plane than between the surface and the third layer of water
molecules for the {110} plane.

Notably, the binding conformation
in which the hydroxylate ion
was directly bound to the surface could not occur owing to Vwall. Ideally, the simulation should be performed
without using the directive UWALL. In this study, we assumed that
the conformation in which the hydroxylate ion was directly bound to
the surface was not stable, as was indicated by our previous MD simulation
study of the glycolate ion.24

Lactate Ion
Figure 4 shows the
free-energy landscapes for the lactate ion.
The free-energy minima appeared at (4.6 Å, 5.8 Å) for the
{001} plane and (4.0 Å, 5.0 Å) for the {110} plane. As in
the case of the glycolate ion, the lactate ion was separated from
the surface by a layered structure of water molecules and the stability
of the most stable conformation was greater for the {110} plane than
for the {001} plane. At both planes, the values of the free-energy
minima for the lactate ion were lower than those for the glycolate
ion, suggesting that the stability of the most stable conformation
was greater for the lactate ion than for the glycolate ion.

Figure 4 Free-energy
landscapes for the conformation of the lactate ion
at the {001} and {110} planes. Snapshots of a typical conformation
corresponding to the free-energy minimum, (4.6 Å, 5.8 Å)
for the {001} plane and (4.0 Å, 5.0 Å) for the {110} plane,
are also shown.

Notably, in contrast
to the case of the glycolate ion, the conformation
in which the COO– group was oriented toward the
surface was the most stable for both the {001} and {110} planes. Furthermore,
the free-energy landscape for the {110} plane indicates the existence
of two metastable conformations at (5.3 Å, 4.3 Å) and (2.7
Å, 2.7 Å). In particular, the thermodynamic stability of
the latter, which corresponded to the second most stable conformation,
was almost equivalent to that of the most stable conformation. Notably,
the free-energy landscape for the {110} plane in Figure 4 shows the free energies from
which Vwall, which was estimated with eq 2, was subtracted.

To determine the relative stabilities of these two conformations,
we increased the simulation run for the lactate ion at the {110} plane
to 16 ns and created the free-energy landscape using the data from
this longer simulation. The free-energy landscape indicated the same
relative stabilities of the two conformations as observed in Figure 4 (Figure S5). However, the free-energy difference remained very
small, even in the free-energy landscape obtained from the longer
simulation. Although we consider that the relative stabilities of
the different conformations shown in Figure 4 are correct, more comprehensive studies
are needed to confirm this.

Figure 5 shows the
ρ profiles for the lactate ion. As in the case of the glycolate
ion, the Oc or Oh atom of the most stable conformation of the lactate
ion at the {001} plane was located at the positions of the Ow atoms
in the second layer of water molecules. For the {110} plane, the positions
of the peaks that appeared in the ρ profiles of the Oc atoms
were almost the same as those observed for the glycolate ion. However,
in contrast to the case of the glycolate ion, the ρ profile
of the Oh atom contained a sharp peak at z = 2.3
Å, where the Ow atom in the second layer of water molecules was
located. The appearance of this sharp peak originated from the second
most stable conformation. This result suggests that the lactate ion
had a tendency to approach the {110} plane more closely than the glycolate
ion.

Figure 5 ρ profiles of the O, Ow, Oc, Oh, and Ho atoms of the lactate
ion along the z direction.

2-Hydroxybutyrate Ion
Figure 6 shows the free-energy landscapes for the
2-hydroxybutyrate ion. The free-energy minima appeared at (4.6 Å,
5.8 Å) for the {001} plane and (4.0 Å, 5.0 Å) for the
{110} plane, indicating that the most stable conformations were the
same as those of the lactate ion. As in the case of the glycolate
and lactate ions, the stability of the most stable conformation was
greater for the {110} plane than for the {001} plane. For both planes,
the values of the free-energy minima for the 2-hydroxybutyrate ion
were lower than those for the glycolate and lactate ions, suggesting
that the most stable conformation of the 2-hydroxybutyrate ion had
the greatest stability among the most stable conformations of the
three hydroxylate ions.

Figure 6 Free-energy landscapes for the conformation
of the 2-hydroxybutyrate
ion at the {001} and {110} planes. Snapshots of a typical conformation
corresponding to the free-energy minimum, (4.6 Å, 5.8 Å)
for the {001} plane and (4.0 Å, 5.0 Å) for the {110} plane,
are also shown.

In contrast to the case
of the lactate ion, the 2-hydroxybutyrate
ion did not show a tendency to approach the {110} plane more closely
than the glycolate ion. Figure 7 shows the ρ profiles for the 2-hydroxybutyrate ion.
It can be seen that the conformation of the 2-hydroxybutyrate ion
was strongly influenced by the layered structure of water molecules,
as with the stable conformations of the glycolate and lactate ions.

Discussion
Differences in Stable Binding Conformation
between Hydroxylate
Ions
The present results indicate that the most stable conformation
at the {001} plane for the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions is quite
different from that for the glycolate ion. Here, we discuss the reason
for this difference. In our previous paper,24 we rationalized why the COO– group of the stable
conformation of the glycolate ion at the {001} plane was oriented
toward water as follows. The COO– group interacts
strongly with both the rutile surface and water. However, as the glycolate
ion was located at a position relatively far from the surface, the
COO– group could not interact strongly with the
surface. Therefore, the conformation in which the COO– group was oriented toward water to form hydrogen bonds with water
molecules was preferred. The present results suggest that this explanation
does not apply to the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions.

If
the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions adopted a conformation in which
the COO– group was oriented toward water at the
{001} plane, the methyl group of the lactate ion and the ethyl group
of the 2-hydroxybutyrate ion would necessarily be oriented toward
the surface. Consequently, the water molecules surrounding the methyl
or ethyl group would form a hydration structure, resulting in a loss
of entropy and disruption of the layered structure of water formed
at the {001} plane. Thus, the conformation in which the COO– group was oriented toward water would lead to an increase in the
free energy of the system. This hypothesis qualitatively explains
why the conformation in which the COO– group was
oriented toward the surface was rather preferred for the lactate and
2-hydroxybutyrate ions.

To test this hypothesis, we performed
an MD simulation of the {001}
system in which the conformation of the lactate ion was fixed such
that its COO– group was oriented toward water and
its methyl group was oriented toward the surface (Figure 8a). In this simulation, the
C3 atom constituting the methyl group was located at a position close
to the second layer of water molecules (Figure 8b). Figure 8c shows a plot of the pair distribution function, g, as a function of the distance between the C3 and Ow atoms, rC3–Ow. For comparison, a plot of the
values of g obtained from a separate MD simulation
in which the methyl group of the lactate ion was oriented toward water
is also shown. The appearance of the large peak around rC3–Ow = 3.7 Å provides evidence for the formation
of a hydration structure around the methyl group. Notably, the water
molecules in parts of the hydration structure were those contained
within the second layer of water molecules. A small peak also appeared
around rC3–Ow = 3.3 Å because
the C3 atom displaced some of the water molecules in the second layer
of water molecules from their ideal positions, and these water molecules
were also part of the hydration structure. These results suggest that
the layered structure of water was partially disrupted by the formation
of the hydration structure. The higher peak observed for the second
layer of water molecules in Figure 8b compared with that in Figure 5 originated from a loss in entropy of the
water molecule arrangement due to the formation of the hydration structure.

the lactate ion was fixed such that its COO– group
was oriented toward water and its methyl group was oriented toward
the surface. (a) Snapshot of the lactate ion in the system. (b) ρ
profiles of the O, Ow, Hw, Oc, and C3 atoms of the lactate ion along

values of g obtained from a separate MD simulation
in which the methyl group of the lactate ion was oriented toward water
are also plotted (dashed line).

Notably, the stable conformations observed for the lactate
and
2-hydroxybutyrate ions at both planes and the glycolate ion at the
{110} plane were consistent with a well-known stable conformation
for organic molecules containing a COO– group at
ionic crystal surfaces, in which the COO– group
is oriented toward the surface.80−82 However, the present result for
the glycolate ion at the {001} plane suggests that the conformation
in which the COO– group is oriented toward water
can also be the most stable, depending on the structure of the additive,
the thickness and stability of the layered structure of water, and
the interaction of the additive with the surface.

Relationship
between the Present Results and Experimental Rutile
Crystals Grown in the Presence of Hydroxy Acids
According
to the experimental study performed by Kobayashi et al.,52 glycolic, lactic, and 2-hydroxybutyric acids,
all induce an increase in the growth rate at the rutile surface. The
extent of the increase in the growth rate was reported to be considerably
greater for lactic and 2-hydroxybutyric acids than for glycolic acid.
Supposing that a more stable conformation of hydroxylate ions at the
rutile surface leads to a greater increase in the growth rate, the
present results indicating the greater stabilities of the most stable
conformations of the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions compared with
the glycolate ion explain the differences in the experimentally observed
growth rates in the presence of the three hydroxy acids.

Typically,
the growth rate at a crystal surface decreases if additives bind to
lattice sites, such as kinks, and inhibit the incorporation of crystal
atoms at these sites.1 However, we do not
believe that this applies to the present systems because the stable
conformations of all three hydroxylate ions appeared at positions
relatively far from the surface owing to the layered structure of
water molecules. Conversely, the growth rate at a crystal surface
may increase if the additives serve to decrease the surface free energy.1 We therefore speculate that the increase in the
growth rate at the rutile surface originates from a decrease in the
surface free energy. It is natural to speculate that a more stable
conformation at the rutile surface leads to a greater decrease in
the surface free energy and, hence, a greater increase in the growth
rate.

The experimental study also indicated that the extent
of the increase
in the growth rate at the {110} plane was slightly greater for lactic
acid than for 2-hydroxybutyric acid.52 This
cannot be explained by the present results, in which the most stable
conformation at the {110} plane was more stable for the 2-hydroxybutyrate
ion than for the lactate ion. This experimental observation may be
attributable to the existence of the second most stable conformation
at positions close to the {110} plane only for the lactate ion. In
general, the decrease in the surface free energy mediated by additives
is enhanced by increasing the additive concentration.1 We speculate that the existence of both the most stable
and second most stable conformations at the {110} plane only for the
lactate ion leads to a higher surface concentration for the lactate
ion than for the 2-hydroxybutyrate ion.

The experimental study
also indicated that glycolic, lactic, and
2-hydroxybutyric acids all induce an increase in the {110} area ratio
of rutile crystals.52 This increase in
the {110} area ratio originates from an increase in the growth rate
at the {001} plane only for glycolic acid and an increase in the growth
rate at both the {001} and {110} planes for lactic and 2-hydroxybutyric
acids.52 Thus, it is speculated that the
anisotropy in the stable conformation of hydroxylate ions is not identical
for glycolate, lactate, and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions. This speculation
is consistent with the present finding that the anisotropy in the
stable conformation of the glycolate ion between the {001} and {110}
planes was different from those for the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate
ions.

The experimentally observed increase in the {110} area
ratio suggests
that the extent of the decrease in the surface free energy mediated
by hydroxylate ions is greater for the {001} plane than for the {110}
plane. The origin of this difference remains unclear. The present
simulation was performed using a simple model system in which a single
hydroxylate ion was placed at an ideally flat rutile surface, whereas
the growth of actual rutile crystals occurs at surfaces possessing
steps and kinks in the presence of numerous hydroxylate ions. Further
simulations using a more realistic system are therefore required to
elucidate the origin of the differences in the extent of the decrease
in the surface free energy mediated by hydroxylate ions at the various
planes.

Conclusions
The thermodynamically
stable conformations of glycolate, lactate,
and 2-hydroxybutyrate ions at the {001} and {110} planes of a rutile
crystal were investigated using the MTD method. For both planes, the
stability of the most stable conformation was highest for the 2-hydroxybutyrate
ion and lowest for the glycolate ion. For all three hydroxylate ions,
the stability of the most stable conformation was higher at the {110}
plane than at the {001} plane.

In this study, we assumed that
the conformation in which the hydroxylate
ion was directly bound to the surface was not stable, in accordance
with our previous MD simulation study of the glycolate ion.24 However, more comprehensive studies should be
conducted to confirm this in the future.

The anisotropy in the
most stable conformation between the planes
was not identical for the three hydroxylate ions. For the {110} plane,
all three hydroxylate ions adopted the same most stable conformation
in which the COO– group was oriented toward the
surface. However, for the {001} plane, only the lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate
ions adopted a most stable conformation in which the COO– group was oriented toward the surface, whereas the glycolate ion
adopted a most stable conformation in which the COO– group was oriented toward water. For the {110} plane, a second most
stable conformation was also found for the lactate ion at positions
close to the surface.

Supposing that all three hydroxylate ions
serve to decrease the
surface free energy at the rutile surface and that a more stable conformation
leads to a greater decrease in the surface free energy, the present
results qualitatively explain the experimentally observed differences
in the extent of the increase in the growth rate at the surfaces of
rutile crystals in the presence of glycolic, lactic, and 2-hydroxybutyric
acids.

In this study, two simple atom–atom distances,
namely, that
between a surface Ti ion and the C1 atom of the hydroxylate ion and
that between the Ti ion and the C2 atom, were used as the CVs. The
results demonstrate that the MTD method with these simple CVs is sufficient
for determining the most stable and metastable conformations of hydroxylate
ions at rutile planes and evaluating their relative stabilities.

To date, the differences in the stabilities of the conformations
of various additives at crystal surfaces have mainly been evaluated
based on the differences in the strengths of the electrostatic interactions
between the additive and crystal surface, which originate from the
differences in the valences of the additives or the functional groups
present.83 In this study, the valence was
identical for the three hydroxylate ions. The functional groups present
in the hydroxylate ion were also the same, namely, a single COO– group and a single OH group. Therefore, the differences
in the strengths of the electrostatic interactions between the three
hydroxylate ion additives and the surface can be considered to be
small. The differences in the anisotropic stable conformations of
the three hydroxylate ions, which were successfully detected using
the present MTD method, originated mainly from the very small structural
differences between the hydroxylate ions, namely, H atom, methyl group,
or ethyl group.

In conclusion, the present MTD method is applicable
to investigating
fine differences in the stable conformations of additives between
different crystal surfaces, which is expected to improve our understanding
of the mechanisms of crystal growth and morphology control using additives.

Elucidation of the stable conformations of large additives possessing
complex structures, such as polypeptides, at inorganic crystal surfaces
is becoming increasingly important for the development of hybrid materials84 and understanding the mechanism of biomineralization.4,85,86 The present MTD method is expected
to serve as a helpful tool for studying the stable conformations of
such large and complex additives. This method should also assist in
studying ice growth inhibition by antifreeze proteins.87−89 Kobayashi et al. reported that the changes in the growth rate at
the rutile surface and the {110} area ratio in the presence of carboxylic
acids or alcohols were different from those in the presence of hydroxy
acids.52 The application of the present
MTD method to elucidate this difference will also be an interesting
topic for future work.
