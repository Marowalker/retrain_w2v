In this study, we
have evaluated a water-soluble, nontarget reagent
and a carrier-free diiron hexacarbonyl complex, [Fe2{μ-SCH2CH(OH)CH2(OH)}2(CO)6] (TG-FeCORM), that can induce the site-specific release of carbon
monoxide (CO) in cancer cells triggered by endogenous glutathione
(GSH). The releasing rate of CO was dependent on the amount of endogenous
GSH. Being the amount of endogenous GSH higher in cancer cells than
in normal cells, the CO-releasing rate resulted faster in cancer cells.
Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties related to the intracellular
CO release of TG-FeCORM were also confirmed in the living
HeLa cells.

Introduction
Carbon monoxide (CO)
as one of the byproducts of heme catabolism
through heme oxygenase-1 has been admitted as an endogenous vital
messenger molecule in mammals.1−3 CO plays many important roles
in protecting tissue via its antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory
effects.4−6 Thus, CO appears to have great potentials in therapeutic
applications. Unfortunately, CO is also a highly toxic gas because
of its high binding capability with hemoglobin and myoglobin.1,2 The precise control of CO location is one of the critical factors
for useful therapeutic responses. CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) have
been used to simulate the therapeutic effect of CO in a few biological
conditions.7 Organometallic carbonyl complexes
are well-suited to be candidates as CORMs.8−10 Among organometallic
carbonyl complexes, CORM-2 and water-soluble CORM-3 are currently
the most frequently used CORMs for investigating physiological functions
of CO release both in vitro and in vivo.8 CO release from CORMs in tissues for treatment requires safe conditions.
Therefore, site-specific CORMs as therapeutic agents represent a crucial
point to be evaluated. To date, organic photo-CORMs,11 micelles-CORMs,12 nanocarrier
CORMs,13 and bovine serum albumin14 have been explored for the site-specific CO
release. However, only several nontarget reagents and carrier-free
CORMs for site-specific CO release have yet been reported.10d,10p In addition, many CORMs have a fast CO-releasing rate in physiological
buffer, with a short half-life (t1/2).8 Stable CORMs with longer t1/2 are required to improve the functions and bioavailability.
Therefore, novel transition metal carbonyl complexes that are suitable
for site-specific CO release with high biocompatibility, excellent
bioavailability, and low cost need to be further investigated.

[Fe2{μ-SCH2CH(OH)CH2(OH)}2(CO)6] (TG-FeCORM) is a water-soluble
organometallic diiron hexacarbonyl compound, which has been reported
in our previous work.15TG-FeCORM releases CO through substitution reaction by thiol groups of cysteamine
(CysA). Because iron is an essential element in human life, TG-FeCORM was confirmed to be biocompatible.15 It is known that glutathione (GSH) has a thiol group and
its concentration is different in normal cells (∼2 mM) and
cancer cells (∼10 mM).16−18 Herein, we reported that GSH
could stimulate TG-FeCORM to release CO in a concentration-dependent
way. Moreover, we observed for the first time that the CO-releasing
rate of TG-FeCORM triggered by GSH was significantly
different in normal and cancer cells. As a transition metal carbonyl
complex, TG-FeCORM is able to achieve site-specific release
of CO in cancer cells (Scheme 1).

Proposal Site-Specific CO Release in Cancer Cells Triggered by Endogenous
GSH
Results and Discussion
The kinetic analysis of CO release from TG-FeCORM was
monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy using the myoglobin assay.
The high-intensity absorbance Soret band, nearly 420 nm, was also
observed here.19 Linear variations were
not apparent for the analysis of CO release. Therefore, the release
of CO from TG-FeCORM triggered by GSH was investigated
by monitoring the absorption wavelength between 500 and 600 nm, and
two new absorption peaks at 540 and 577 nm were observed that belong
to the Q band region of MbCO (Figure S1).10e,10n,20 Without GSH, TG-FeCORM completely released CO in 760 min, and the t1/2 was 480 min (Figure 1a, Table S1, Supporting Information). The result was caused by a reducing agent, sodium
dithionite, which was used to reduce deoxymyoglobin.10e,10n In our previous study, TG-FeCORM did not decompose
until 150 min in the physiological saline detected by infrared spectroscopy.15b Therefore, TG-FeCORM in physiological
conditions is very stable. Upon the addition of 2 mM GSH, CO was released
completely in 255 min with a t1/2 of 125
min (Figure 1b, Table
S1, Supporting Information). With 10 mM
GSH, CO was completely released in 105 min with a t1/2 of about 53 min (Figure 1c, Table S1, Supporting Information). Overall, the CO-releasing rate depended on the
amount of GSH (Figure 1d). The intracellular endogenous GSH concentration is ∼2 mM
in normal cells.17 Whereas the concentration
of endogenous GSH in cancer cells is 4 times that of normal cells.18 As indicated by our results, it is inferred
that differences in GSH concentrations could lead to significant differences
of CO release from TG-FeCORM.

absorption spectra of TG-FeCORM in the absence of GSH
(a), and in the presence of 2 mM GSH (b),
and 10 mM GSH (c). CO release by TG-FeCORM (20 μM)
triggered by different concentrations of GSH vs time in reduced deoxymyoglobin
(d). All of the myoglobin assays were carried out at 37 °C in
phosphate buffer solution.

TG-FeCORM had excellent cell compatibility when
its
concentration was less than 80 μmol/L in vitro (Figures S2–S7, Supporting Information). The intracellular concentrations
of GSH in normal cells (HL-7702) and cancer cells (BEL-7402 and HeLa)
were detected according to a commercial GSH assay kit.21 Intracellular GSH concentrations of HL-7702,
BEL-7402, and HeLa cells were determined to be approximately 3 ±
1, 14 ± 2, and 12 ± 1 mM, respectively. The measured concentrations
of endogenous GSH in cells are consistent with the data detected by
the Yang’s group.21 The results
confirmed that there are about fourfold or fivefold higher concentrations
of endogenous GSH in BEL-7402 and HeLa cells over HL-7702 cells. The
concentration difference of endogenous GSH between normal cells and
cancer cells is in accordance with the results of the Kuppusamy’s
group.18 CO release from TG-FeCORM triggered by endogenous GSH was further evaluated in vitro. Intracellular
CO-releasing profiles were measured using COP-1, a CO-responsive turn-on
fluorescent probe, with a limit of detection of 1 μM (∼28
ppb).22 In contrast to the negative control
(Figure 2, top row),
clear green fluorescent signals were observed when HeLa cells were
treated with the positive control CORM-3 (Figure 2, middle row), as well as TG-FeCORM (Figure 2, bottom
row), confirming that both CORM-3 and TG-FeCORM could
release CO in the living HeLa cells. The time-dependent mean value
of total fluorescence intensity of living HeLa cells was integrated
at the same condition to test the CO-releasing process (Figure S8, Supporting Information). CO release from CORM-3
or TG-FeCORM was fast in the first 5 min. The nonsignificant
change of fluorescence intensity indicates that the CO release from
CORM-3 did not change during 10–60 min (Figures 2 and S8, Supporting Information). By contrast, the evident increase of fluorescence intensity suggests
that CO release from TG-FeCORM is continuous within 60
min (Figures 2 and
S8, Supporting Information). Thus, the
releasing time of TG-FeCORM is more durable than CORM-3
in living HeLa cells. With 10 mM GSH, CO was completely released in
105 min, according to the myoglobin assay. The detected endogenous
GSH concentration in HeLa cells is about 12 mM. Consequently, CO may
be completely released from TG-FeCORM in about 100 min
combined with the above results.

Figure 2 Time-dependent confocal microscopy images
of CO site-specific release
by TG-FeCORM in living HeLa cells. HeLa cells were preincubated
with nothing (top row), 20 μM CORM-3 (middle row), and 20 μM TG-FeCORM (bottom row) for 30 min. All samples were incubated
with 1 μM COP-1 for 30 min. Images were taken every 10 min.
Scale bars: 20 μm.

The performances of CO release from TG-FeCORM were
further investigated with fluorescence imaging experiments, carried
out in vitro using normal cells (HL-7702) and cancer cells (BEL-7402
and HeLa). As shown in Figure 3a, green fluorescence was very weak in HL-7702 treated with
COP-1 to detect CO release, indicating that the amount of CO release
by TG-FeCORM triggered by endogenous GSH was very low.
In contrast, the green fluorescence was remarkably enhanced in BEL-7402
and HeLa cells, indicating that released CO in cancer cells was clearly
higher compared to that in normal cells. These results demonstrated
that the differences in the concentration of endogenous GSH could
lead to a site-specific CO release from TG-FeCORM in
cancer cells. We also evaluated the effect of CORM-3 in vitro. The
fluorescence signals were observed in HL-7702, BEL-7402, and HeLa
cells (Figure 3b),
showing that CORM-3 could not achieve site-specific CO release in
cancer cells. In contrast, TG-FeCORM could lead to the
site-specific CO release triggered by endogenous GSH in cancer cells.
For HL-7702 cells, fluorescence induced by TG-FeCORM is
weak, as shown in Figure 3a, whereas that induced by CORM-3 is very strong, as shown
in Figure 3b. Thus,
compared to CORM-3, TG-FeCORM is relatively stable in
normal cells.

Figure 3 Confocal microscopy images for cellular CO release from TG-FeCORM (a), CORM-3 (b) in living HL-7702, BEL-7402, and
HeLa cells, respectively.
Images were taken after the treatment with 20 μM TG-FeCORM (a), 20 μM CORM-3 (b), and Hoechst 33342 for 30 min, followed
by 1 μM COP-1 for 30 min. In each panel, left pictures show
the nucleus stained using Hoechst 33342 (blue), middle pictures show
COP-1 detected by CO with turn-on signal (green), and right pictures
show merged images. Scale bars: 20 μm.

To confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of CO release from TG-FeCORM, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines
were detected with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1α, an anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10, and a tumor necrosis factor TNF-α in HeLa cells
were stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in vitro.9,13b,23 LPS had no distinct cytotoxicity
toward HeLa cells in the range of 0–100 μmol/L (Figure
S9, Supporting Information). TG-FeCORM had excellent cell compatibility to HeLa cells when its concentration
is in the range of 0–40 μmol/L (Figure S10, Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4, HeLa cells displayed
a positive inflammatory response with the LPS stimulated, as the concentrations
of IL-6, IL-1α, IL-10, and TNF-α increased remarkably
(red bars). However, the expression levels of IL-6, IL-1α, IL-10,
and TNF-α were continuously decreased with the concentration
of TG-FeCORM rising from 20 to 40 μmol/L. The result
showed that the treatment of HeLa cells with TG-FeCORM significantly decreased the expression levels of IL-6, IL-1α,
IL-10, and TNF-α within the LPS-stimulated HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent
manner. This downregulation of inflammatory cytokines indicated that TG-FeCORM exhibited the anti-inflammatory characteristics
related to the intracellular CO release in cancer cells, and thus
the anti-inflammation effect of TG-FeCORM should be attributed
to the released CO in cells. In addition, the treatment with TG-FeCORM reduced the nuclear shift of p50 and p65 in LPS-stimulated
HeLa cells (Figure S11, Supporting Information). By contrast, the total levels of ß-actin and proliferating
cell nuclear antigen were unaffected after being treated with TG-FeCORM (Figure S11, Supporting Information). It was speculated that CO release from TG-FeCORM effect
on inflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated HeLa cells might be associated
with the NF-ΚB signaling pathway.9,23 These results
are consistent with the CO release from TG-FeCORM, triggered
by endogenous GSH in cancer cells.

expression of TNF-α,
IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-10 in LPS-stimulated HeLa cells. LPS (10
μg/mL) was employed to stimulate to produce inflammatory cytokines.
Untreated cells were employed as controls. The incubation time of TG-FeCORM was 24 h. Differences were defined as significant
at *p < 0.05.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our experimental results demonstrated
for the first
time that the water-soluble TG-FeCORM could act as an
endogenous GSH-responsive CORM. We observed that CO release from TG-FeCORM was clearly dependent on the concentration of GSH,
both in tubes and in cells. As indicated by our results, significant
differences of endogenous GSH between normal cells and cancer cells
could lead to the site-specific CO release from TG-FeCORM in cancer cells. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties and
the longer releasing time contributed to the potential therapeutic
role of TG-FeCORM for medical applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Apparatus
Myoglobin and 1-thioglycerol
were bought from Aladdin and employed as received. HeLa, HL-7702,
and BEL-7402 cell lines were bought from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Images were obtained by a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser point-scanning
microscope. The ELISA test was measured using a finite M200 microplate
absorbance reader, Tecan. Myoglobin kinetics assay was measured with
a UV spectrophotometer (UV-2600). All reagents were purchased from
commercial sources and utilized without further disposal. All solvents
were freshly distilled prior to use.

Myoglobin Kinetics Assay26,27
For the myoglobin
assay, all solutions were prepared in the phosphate buffer at pH =
7.4. A myoglobin solution (2 mg/mL) was degassed through pouring into
nitrogen for more than 15 min. Then, a freshly prepared solution of
sodium dithionite (24 mg/mL) with 1:10 dithionite/dexy-Mb (v/v) added
to the above degassed solution, which gave a 108 μM/mL dexy-Mb.
An appropriate amount of TG-FeCORM and GSH was added
to the dexy-Mb solution (Table S1). The
solution was moved quickly into a room. UV–vis spectra were
taken at 37 °C at predetermined time points by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer and measured with a wavelength from 600 to 500 nm
by an interval of 2 nm. Quantification of CO release was calculated
from the obtained spectra according to the equation below (eqs 1–3).

Equation 1 was used for counting the total myoglobin quantity of saturated
Mb-CO solution. ε represents the extinction coefficient while
Mb-CO is 15.4 mM–1 cm–1 and OD540 is the absorbance of Mb-CO solution while the wavelength
is 540 nm. 1  

Intermediate quantities of Mb-CO are
counted by the OD540. A novel extinction coefficient (ε2) must be calculated
to consider the altered absorbance at 540 nm (ΔOD540). To improve the calculation accuracy, another wavelength serves
as a constant reference point. There are four isosbestic (ODiso) points (510, 550, 570, and 585 nm) in Mb-CO and deoxy-Mb spectra.
The data at 510 nm (ODiso510) were utilized in this set
of experiments. ε2 was calculated by eq 2.

Equation 2 was used
to count the unknown Mb-CO extinction coefficient. ΔODiso510 is the altered absorbance at the isosbestic point; ΔOD540 is the altered absorbance at 540 nm; and Mb-COmax is the maximum concentration of myoglobin. 2  

From ε2 and the altered absorbance of 510 and
540 nm, the unknown myoglobin concentration will be obtained as given
in eq 3, which was used
to count the Mb-CO concentration. 3  

t1/2 values are given as the time when
the concentration of Mb-CO is equal to half the start concentration
of TG-FeCORM.

Assessing the Cytotoxicity of TG-FeCORM Using MTT
Assay
HeLa cells (180 μL, 1 × 105 cells
mL–1) were seeded into 96 well microtitre plates
and treated with 24 h. Then, the medium in wells was abandoned and
added a medium including a mixture of TG-FeCORM. In addition,
the concentrations of TG-FeCORM were 10, 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 μmol·L–1.
The cells were then treated with another 24 h before the treatment
medium took the place of the complete medium. Cells in a well without
the addition of TG-FeCORM were used as a control (100%
in cell viability). Each concentration was detected in five wells
of the same plate. It was repeated three times to test the reproducibility
of the assessment.

Probe COP-1 Fluorescence Response by Confocal
Microscopy Imaging
Probe COP-1 was synthesized according
to the literature.9,22 Images were obtained by a Zeiss
LSM 710 confocal laser point-scanning
microscope with a 40× oil objective lens, and a numerical aperture
of 1.3. COP-1 was excited by a 488 nm laser, and Hoescht 33342 was
excited using a diode laser 405 nm, and they were read at green (λem = 500–550 nm) and blue (λem = 420–470
nm), respectively. Cells were imaged at 37 °C and 5% CO2 throughout the course of the experiment. HeLa cells (5 × 105 cells mL–1) were seeded in laser confocal
culture dish 2 days before the experiment. Culture conditions were
the same, as used for the routine cell passage using RPMI-1640 medium.
HeLa cells were preincubated with nothing (top row), 20 μM CORM-3
(middle row), and 20 μM TG-FeCORM (bottom row)
for 30 min, respectively, and then all of them were incubated with
1 μM COP-1 for 30 min. Images were taken every 2 min using representative
images of the experiment. Mean of total fluorescence intensity of
treated TG-FeCORM or CORM-3 versus untreated cells was
compared using representative images of the independent experiment.
Data are presented in the graphs (Figure S7) as a mean of total fluorescent intensity.

Measurement of GSH Concentration
by Commercial Assay Kit
GSH concentration of HL-7702, BEL-7402,
and HeLa cells were measured
by an 5,5-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid method used in the commercial
GSH assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China).
The absorbance at 412 nm was measured using a microplate reader.22

Cytokine Modulation by CO Release9
Growth medium levels of the tested chemokines
were quantified
using Human IL-1α, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α Mini ELISA Development
kits (PeproTech, sensitivity range of 0.063 ng/mL to 4 μg/mL)
and revealed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate
reagent set (BD Biosciences) on the basis of the manufacturer’s
protocol. The absorbance in each well was detected at 450 nm with
a microplate reader (Infinite M200 microplate absorbance reader, Tecan).
Cells were plated with the 2.5 × 105 cell/well in
6 well plates. Five groups were tested: cells were incubated with
LPS or without LPS and then treated with TG-FeCORM (20–40
μM), 48 h after seeding. Supernatants were collected at 24 h
post-treatment.

Western Blot Analysis28
Total cell lysates were collected by extracting
with the NEPER kit.
Concentrations of collected proteins were detected through a protein
assay kit. Equal amounts of cellular total proteins were separated
on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
then moved to polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes and sealed with 5%
nonfat milk in TBST buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 20 mM Tris,
pH = 8.0) for 1 h. Then, the membranes were treated with the primary
antibodies (p50 and p65) at 4 °C for 24 h. After a subsequent
washing step, the membrane was treated with the appropriate secondary
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 2 h at 25 °C
and washed 3 times with TBST. The immune reactivity was determined
by Amersham ECL Plus western blotting detection reagents.
