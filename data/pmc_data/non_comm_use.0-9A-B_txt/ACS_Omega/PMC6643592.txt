Originated
from the cyclic delocalization of electrons resulting in extra stability
and instability, aromaticity and antiaromaticity are important chemical
concepts whose appreciation and quantification are still much of recent
interest in the literature. Employing information-theoretic quantities
can provide us with more insights and better understanding about them,
as we have previously demonstrated. In this work, we examine the triplet-state
aromaticity and antiaromaticity, which are governed by Baird’s
4n rule, instead of Hückel’s 4n + 2 rule for the singlet state. To this end, we have made
use of 4 different aromaticity indexes and 8 information-theoretic
quantities, examined a total of 22 substituted fulvene derivatives,
and compared the results both in singlet and triplet states. It is
found that cross-correlations of these two categories of molecular
property descriptors enable us to better understand the nature and
propensity of aromaticity and antiaromaticity for the triplet state.
Our results have not only demonstrated the existence and validity
of Baird’s rule but also shown that Hückel’s
rule and Baird’s rule indeed share the same theoretical foundation
because with these cross-correlation patterns we are able to distinguish
them from each other simultaneously in both singlet and triplet states.
Our results should provide new insights into the nature of aromaticity
and antiaromaticity in the triplet state and pave the road toward
new ways to quantify this pair of important chemical concepts.

1 Introduction
Even
though theoretical and computational chemistry has been well established
nowadays from the perspective of both accuracy and complexity, how
to quantify chemical concepts widely employed in the literature and
textbooks to appreciate molecular structure, stability, and reactivity
properties is a still unresolved task.1,2 The concept
of aromaticity or antiaromaticity is such an example.3−5 It has to do with the extra stability or instability of a cyclic
yet planar structure because of the additional delocalization of electrons,6 either π or σ, leading to the redistribution
of the electron density of the system.7−10 The controversy about aromaticity lies in
the fact that many different categories of aromaticity have been unveiled
in the literature,3,11,12 lots of descriptors to characterize it have been proposed as well,13 but there exists no single descriptor that can
be used as the general quantitative measure.14 The culprit is the fact that these descriptors are often measures
of one property only from its many manifestations of the phenomenon,
such as energetics,6 geometry,3 ring current,15 and
so forth, which are the consequences of the aromaticity phenomenon,
not its root cause. We need to adopt an approach to examine the concept
of aromaticity from a more general viewpoint which should cover various
aspects of aromaticity of different structures, subsets, and spin
states. The information-theoretic approach (ITA) from density functional
reactivity theory (DFRT) is believed to be such a framework.16

Using substituted fulvene derivatives
in the singlet state, in our previous study,17 we have demonstrated the feasibility of applying ITA to study aromaticity
and antiaromaticity from a completely different perspective.17 In that work, we employed a four-dimensional
approach, with 5 fulvene ring sizes, 24 substitution groups, 4 aromaticity
indexes, and 8 information-theoretic quantities. We chose fulvene
derivatives because their aromaticity character is influenced by the
nature of the substituting group, and these model systems were widely
used in the literature.17−19 A large wealth of data stemmed
from our previous study enabled us to provide novel insights into
aromaticity and antiaromaticity. The most important finding from that
work is that there exist two completely opposite yet strong correlations,
one positive and the other negative, between information-theoretic
quantities and aromaticity indexes. These two groups of cross-correlations
between these two sets of properties (aromaticity indexes and ITA
quantities) for fulvene derivatives with different ring sizes happen
to have a total number of 4n + 2 and 4n π electrons, where n is a whole number, on
their fulvene ring, respectively, which agrees remarkably well with
Hückel’s rule of aromaticity and antiaromaticity.20,21

For triplet states, it is known that Hückel’s
4n + 2 rule is no longer valid in governing the propensity
of aromaticity. It is instead replaced by Baird’s rule,21,22 which dictates that the lowest triplet state of a ring structure
is aromatic only when it has 4n π-electrons.
To prove it, Baird developed a theoretical argument from the perturbation
molecular orbital theory,21 whose validity
has since been confirmed by many more accurate studies.23−28 Meanwhile, Zilberg et al. proposed that the 4n aromatic
rule of triplet states can be simply regarded as 4n – 2 Hückel aromatic cycles plus two nonbonding π-electrons
of the same spin.29 Mandado also interpreted
4n triplet state and 4n + 2 singlet
state rules using 2n + 1 πα/2n – 1 πβ orbitals
and 2n + 1 πα/2n + 1 πβ orbitals, respectively.30 It remains to be seen, however, that among the
many descriptors proposed for the singlet state aromaticity if they
are still applicable for the triplet state and whether or not there
exists the same perplexed situation as for the singlet state aromaticity
and antiaromaticity as we have demonstrated previously.17 In this work, continuing to use substituted
fulvenes as illustrative examples,17,18,31 we will address these issues. In specific, we seek
answers for the following three questions. (i) Are the conventional
aromaticity descriptors able to characterize the triplet state aromaticity
and antiaromaticity? (ii) Does the ITA provide any new physiochemical
insight into aromaticity, similar to what we have observed in the
singlet state? (iii) More importantly, is it possible to employ the
ITA quantities to provide a common theoretic foundation for both singlet-
and triplet-state aromaticity and antiaromaticity, and henceforth
we can appreciate both Hückel’s 4n +
2 and Baird’s 4n rules with the same theoretic
understanding?

2 Theoretical Framework
The key idea of DFRT is to employ simple density functionals to appreciate
and quantify chemical properties for a molecular system.16 This idea originates from the basic theorems
of DFT, which dictate that all structure, bonding, reactivity, and
other properties of a molecular system in the singlet state should
be determined by the information contained in the electron density,
ρ(r).1 Steric effect,32 electrophilicity/nucleophilicity,33−35 acidity/basicity,36−39 and regioselectivity/stereoselectivity33,35 are a few recent examples of chemical concepts quantified by simple
density functionals. On the other hand, a list of quantities from
information theory is well known to be simple density functionals.
Whether or not they can be employed to appreciate molecular properties
and chemical concepts is a recent research interest in the literature.16 These information-theoretic quantities include
Shannon entropy SS(16,40) 1  which is a local
functional of the electron density and a measure of the spatial delocalization
of the electron density. The second quantity is Fisher information IF(16,40) 2  which
is a functional of both the electron density and its gradient |∇ρ|
and is a gauge of the sharpness or localization of the electron density
distribution. That is, for uniform electron gas, where |∇ρ|
= 0, IF = 0. The larger the density gradient
|∇ρ|, the larger the Fisher information IF is. Fisher information is closely related to the Weizsäcker
kinetic energy,28 which has recently been
used to quantify the steric effect and stereoselective properties.41

Other information-theoretic quantities
are the Ghosh–Berkowitz–Parr entropy SGBP(16,42) 3  where t(r,ρ) is the kinetic energy
density, tTF(r;ρ) is
the Thomas–Fermi kinetic energy density, and c and k are constants. SGBP was resulted from transcribing the singlet-state density functional
theory into a local thermodynamics through a phase-space distribution
function. The Onicescu information energy of order n is defined as16,43 4  with n ≥ 2. Onicescu introduced this quantity to define
a finer measure of dispersion distribution than that of Shannon entropy,
which is closely related to Rényi entropy and Tsallis entropy.
The relative Shannon entropy, also called information gain, Kullback–Leibler
divergence, or information divergence, has been shown to be an effective
descriptor to determine electrophilicity, nucleophilicity, and regioselectivity,28−31,37 whose definition is as follows16 5  where
ρ0(r) is the reference state density
satisfying the same normalization condition as ρ(r). This reference density can be from the same molecule with different
conformations or from the reactant of a chemical reaction when the
transition state is investigated. Related to the information gain
is the relative Rényi entropy of order n with n ≥ 244 6  

Besides quantifying steric effect and
stereoselectivity with Fisher information32,45 and electrophilicity, nucleophilicity, and regioselectivity with
the relative Shannon entropy,33 these quantities
are additionally applied to accurately predict molecular acidity,36 highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital gap,46 and so forth.
We have also applied these quantities to appreciate chemical phenomena
in a number of other systems, including aromaticity in the singlet
state.17,47,48 A review article
on this subject has recently been appeared.16

Meanwhile, to quantitatively determine aromaticity and antiaromaticity,
numerous descriptors using electronic properties such as energetics,
geometry, ring current, and so forth are available in the literature.3,6,13 However, most of these descriptors
were developed based on singlet states or closed-shell structures.
Here, we consider only four representative descriptors for the two
states. The harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) index
is a geometrical measurement of the equalization of chemical bonds
on a conjugate ring. Its definition is the following3 7  where n is the bond
number of the considered ring, Ropt is
average bond length, Ri is bond length with Å, and α is normalization constant,
α = 257.7 for carbon–carbon. The HOMA value of <0,
=0, and =1 represents antiaromatic, nonaromatic, and perfect aromatic
systems, respectively. The other aromaticity index is the nucleus-independent
chemical shift (NICS) derived from the electromagnetic effect because
of the aromatic ring current. It is found that diamagnetic or diatropic
ring current is associated with aromaticity, whereas a paramagnetic
or paratropic ring current signals antiaromaticity. This difference
in ring current leads to the noticeable difference in NMR chemical
shifts. A more negative value of NICS is an indication of a stronger
aromaticity, and a more positive value of NICS is an indication of
a stronger antiaromaticity. In formulating NICS, the chemical shift
is expressed as the sum of sum of partial chemical shifts arising
from occupied molecular orbitals Ψk0 at the chosen points located at or on top of the aromatic ring13 8  where RN is the chosen point for calculation, r is the electron coordinate, rN = r – RN is the relative coordinate, LN = rN × ∇ is the angular momentum, I is the unit matrix, and the first and second term on the right side
are diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions, respectively. Three
popular NICS values, NICS(0), NICS(1), and NICS(1)ZZ considered in this work stand for the NICS value at the center
of the aromatic carbon ring, 1 Å above the ring center, and the ZZ component of NICS(1), respectively.13 The multicenter index (MCI) was also used to measure the
aromaticity from electronic aspect, which is defined as 9  where  is an operator
acting on  that produces
all n! permutations of atoms in the cycle.49 A larger MCI value indicates stronger aromaticity.
It should be noted that the normalized MCI was used for the comparison
purpose among different cyclic sizes. The normalized MCI values were
calculated as (MCI)1/n The normal MCI were calculated
as (MCI)1/n, where the n is the ring size,49 but still labeled as MCI. Finally, the aromatic
stabilization energy (ASE) is calculated with the same isodesmic reaction,
shown in Scheme S2, as our previous work.17 This isodesmic reaction destroys the cyclic
delocalization, so positive and negative ASE refer to aromatic and
antiaromatic rings, respectively.

The purpose of the present
work is to calculate the above ITA quantities and aromaticity indexes
for both singlet and triplet states of a series of fulvene derivatives
and to compare their behaviors in correlations. Besides the desire
to discuss the differences of appreciating singlet and triplet states
aromaticity and antiaromaticity using these ITA quantities and aromaticity
indexes, what we are interested the most is to examine the scope and
applicability of Hückel’s and Baird’s rules and
to see whether or not these two rules obey the same cross-correlation
patterns that we previously discovered and thus to enable these properties
to provide a novel understanding about the validity of these rules
in different circumstances.21,50 The answer could be
affirmative based on what was available from the literature, such
as works of Zilberg and Mandado.29,30 Some reference
structures (presented in Scheme S1) with explicit 4n or 4n + 2 number of electron on rings are used
for understanding the relative magnitude of quantities.

3 Results and Discussion
Shown in Tables 1 and 2 as illustrations
are calculated values for Shannon entropy SS, and information gain IG, together with
four aromaticity indexes HOMA, NICS(1)ZZ, ASE, and MCI for 5MR and 7MR series. More details are enclosed
in the Supporting Information. We picked
5MR and 7MR as examples because our previous studies show that these
two series behaved differently in the cross-correlation between information-theoretic
quantities and aromaticity indexes.17 Results
from two reference structures with the same ring size and the known
aromaticity/antiaromaticity propensity are shown in the last two rows
in Tables 1 and 2 for the purpose of comparison. As can be seen from Table 1, for 5MR, whose total
number of π electrons on its rings are influenced by the substituent
group through the exocyclic double bond and clearly reflected on the
aromatic indexes.20,22 Yet, the impact from the substituent
groups is not significant. This point could be witnessed by the average
value of HOMA, NICS(1)ZZ, and ASE indices
and by the comparison with the result for the two reference structures.
Compared with the reference data, the absolute value for most aromatic
indices of pentafulvenes is small. The exception is outlier cases
with CC–, CCH, O–, OH, and NN+. These results suggest that most pentafulvene derivatives
are weak aromatic or antiaromatic, and the impact of the substituting
groups on the exocyclic double bond is not significant on the ring
aromaticity behavior. Switching from singlet to triplet, for the same
molecule, we noticed the switch of the aromaticity indices as well.
For instance, the NICS(1)ZZ value of the
two cases for CCH and NN+ species is 29.70 and −12.30,
respectively, for the singlet state, but those values were changed
to −16.40 and 27.60, respectively, for the triplet state. This
change reflects the fundamental difference from the perspective of
aromaticity for the two spin states. This change is also true for
the two reference structures, C5H5– and C5H5+. We should mention that
this change is always true, and similar observations were reported
in the literature.12 Also shown in Table 1 are numerical values
of two information-theoretic quantities, the Shannon entropy and information
gain. Their values in both the singlet and triplet states did not
change significantly, consistent with the results from our previous
studies.17,44 However, as will be shown below, it is these
small yet discernible fluctuations that will govern the propensity
of aromaticity and antiaromaticity. On the other hand, for the triplet
state results, it is found that HOMA becomes more positive and all
NICS(1)ZZ values are negative, suggesting
that the triplet state of 5MR is aromatic, in excellent agreement
with Baird’s rule.18,21 For the case of 5MR,
for the purpose of predicting the triplet state aromaticity, the NICS
index is more accurate than HOMA.51 Again,
for information-theoretic quantities, each of them fluctuated around
its average value and it is its changing patterns that will dictate
its usefulness and validity in predicting aromaticity and antiaromaticity.

Similar to the 5MR, for 7MR systems, whose total number
of π electrons on the conjugation ring could also change between
6 and 8 depending on the nature of the substituent group on the exocyclic
bond, so, according to Hückel’s rule,20,22 these systems in the singlet state should yield observable changes
between aromaticity and antiaromaticity. The same must be true for
the triplet state. Table 2 shows the results for the same aromaticity indexes and information-theoretic
quantities for both singlet and triple states. For the comparison
purpose, we also listed the results for two reference structures,
C7H7– and C7H7+, whose aromaticity and antiaromaticity features
are known. Consistent with what we found for the 5MR case, the results
from 7MR derivatives show that, generally speaking, the impact from
the substituting groups is not significant, but we do see the existence
of outliers, such as CC– and NN+, whose
absolute value of the aromaticity indices is even larger than that
of the two reference species. We also see the sign switch of the aromaticity
index values in the triplet state, same as that for C7H7– and C7H7+. The result for information-theoretic quantities is similar to those
for 5MR as well.

Put together, from the results shown in Tables 1 and 2, it becomes apparent to us that aromaticity index results
often provide inconsistent and sometimes contradictory predictions
on both singlet-state and triplet-state aromaticity and antiaromaticity.18,52 It is our intention that information-theoretic quantities will provide
an additional dimension to appreciate aromaticity and antiaromaticity.
With the new results from the latter, a better understanding about
the nature of aromaticity will be achieved. This is done through the
correlations between the pair of the quantities from both aromaticity
index and information-theoretic quantities, whose results are shown
and discussed below.

Shown in Table 3 are the correlation coefficients from the
quantities tabulated in Tables 1 and 2. As can be seen from the table, SGBP and IG are strongly
positively correlated for both 5MR and 7MR systems and for both singlet
and triplet states. Also, for aromaticity indexes, HOMA is found to
be reasonably conversely correlated with the two NICS indexes. In
all cases (5MR/7MR, and singlet/triplet states), the correlation coefficient
is negative. The correlations within the categories of aromaticity
indexes and information quantities are less informative because the
correlation coefficient does not change sign either across different
sizes of the fulvene ring or between singlet and triplet states. What
we think is more interesting and more informative is the case of cross-correlations
between these two categories of properties, that is, aromaticity indexes
and information-theoretic quantities. In our previous work, we have
shown that the correlation coefficient of these cross-correlations
changes its sign from one fulvene size to another, and the pattern
of this sign changing depends on the total number of π electrons
on the fulvene ring, which agrees excellently well with Hückel’s
rule.17 Now, let us see if there is a similar
pattern for the triplet-state aromaticity, and, if yes, whether or
not it agrees well with Baird’s rule.

For the cross-correlation between aromaticity indexes,
for example, HOMA, NICS, ASE, and MCI and information-theoretic quantities,
for example, Shannon entropy and information gain, as shown in Table 3, we found that the
correlation coefficient changed sign for the singlet state from 5MR
to 7MR. For example, the correlation coefficient of NICS(1)ZZ versus SS is −0.6389
for 5MR, but that is changed to +0.3871 for 7MR. (These low correlation
coefficients were resulted from a few outliers.) The same is true
for all other cross-correlation coefficients. This result is known,
as we have reported previously.17,44 What is new from the
present study is that for the same ring-size of fulvene derivatives,
the same phenomenon of the sign change is true from the singlet state
to the triplet state. For instance, for 7MR, the correlation coefficient
for the cross-correlation between Ss and
NICS(1)ZZ is −0.5923 for the triplet
state, but the same quantity is changed to +0.3871 for the singlet
state. This is true for all other cross-correlations shown in Table 3 as well. The MCI
values also fluctuate insignificantly when the substituent group is
changed, much to the same as information-theoretic quantities as shown
in Tables 1 and 2. As shown in Table 3, this quantity is not significantly correlated with
any other quantity studies in this work. This result might be an indication
that MCI is not a valid index to quantify aromaticity of fulvene derivatives.
For the ASE index, which has been widely used in the literatures6,28 as a reliable measure of the singlet states aromaticity and antiaromaticity,17 for the triplet states, its reliability as a
measure of aromaticity and antiaromaticity is questionable. This point
can be reflected by the 7MR series, whose ASE values of both triplet
and singlet states are positive, and whose ASE values in the triplet
state are only modestly correlated with other aromaticity indexes.
The correlations among the triplet state of other series, as shown
in Table S4, are not significantly correlated
either. On the basis of these results, the ASE index is not shown
to be an accurate descriptor for the triplet-state aromaticity.28

What does this sign change mean? To be
more specific, what additional information does it convey to us about
aromaticity and antiaromaticity? Earlier, for the singlet state aromaticity,
we did observe this phenomenon with respect to the ring-size change17,48 and found that the pattern of these sign changes was in excellent
agreement with Hückel’s 4n + 2 rule.22 That is, for aromatic systems with the total
number of π electrons equal to 2 and 6, the sign is always the
same, and only for those systems whose total number of π electrons
is 4, we observed the change of the signs. For the latter systems,
according to Hückel’s 4n + 2 rule,
they should be antiaromatic in nature. Given the fact that (i) no
single aromaticity index is able to predict aromaticity and antiaromaticity
correctly and (ii) different aromaticity indexes often yield inconsistent
and many times contradictory results, the cross-correlation results
should provide an additional dimension of knowledge to appreciate
aromaticity and antiaromaticity. For the triplet-state aromaticity,
as shown in Tables 1 and 2, we also disclosed that different aromaticity
indexes, for example, HOMA and NICS, do not provide robust and consistent
predictions about aromaticity and antiaromaticity.53 Plus, information-theoretic quantities alone do not tell
us much about the nature and propensity of aromaticity and antiaromaticity
because their numerical values only fluctuated slightly around their
average value. However, combining aromaticity indexes with information-theoretic
quantities and using the cross-correlations between these two categories
of properties, we could unveil reasonably strong correlations with
unambiguous patterns of changes.

More importantly, as can be
seen from the correlation coefficient values in Table 3, the cross-correlations for the triplet
state are opposite to those for the singlet state. That is, the value
of correlation coefficients for singlet and triplet states is opposite
in sign to each other. This opposite nature in correlation patterns
are in consensus with the two rules governing the aromatic propensity
for these two states, Hückel’s rule for the singlet
state and Baird’s rule for the triplet state.20−22,54 Our results indicate that instead
of employing two separate rules through π-electron number counting
to predicting aromaticity and antiaromaticity for both singlet and
triplet states, we can solely utilize the cross-correlation patterns
between aromaticity indexes and information-theoretic quantities to
ascertain which systems are aromatic and which are antiaromatic. Unifying
predictions of aromaticity and antiaromaticity with cross-correlations
patterns between aromaticity indexes and information-theoretic quantities
for both singlet and triplet states are one of the main results from
this work.

Is this conclusion applicable to other information-theoretic
quantities or other ring sizes of the fulvene derivatives? Shown in Table 4 are values of correlation
coefficients for all of the cross-correlations between four aromaticity
indexes and four information-theoretic quantities for five ring sizes
in both singlet and triplet states. As can be seen from the table,
in singlet state, 3MR, 4MR+, and 7MR, each with 2, 2, and 6 π-electrons
on the fulvene ring, respectively, have the same trend of correlation
coefficients (i.e., the same sign), whereas 4MR– and 5MR each
with 4 π-electrons are opposite in terms of their cross-correlation
coefficients signs. For the triplet state, however, the trend is completely
opposite. All positive values of correlation coefficients in the singlet
state become negative in the triplet state and vice versa. This opposite
nature is also reflected from the two number counting rules, Hückel’s
rule and Baird’s rule, for singlet and triplet states,20−22,54 respectively.

To visualize these opposite patterns in triplet and singlet states,
shown in Figure 1 are
illustrative examples using the Shannon entropy SS and the ASE aromaticity index for fulvene derivatives
with three ring sizes (color-coded). The linear correlations between SS and ASE for the triplet state are exhibited
in Figure 1a, whereas
those for the singlet state are displayed in Figure 1b. As can be unambiguously seen, the slope
of the fitted line is opposite in these two states. If the slope is
positive in Figure 1a, it will become negative in Figure 1b. The opposite is true as well. This figure unquestionably
demonstrates that the two states should be governed by two different
rules, Hückel’s rule and Baird’s rule20−22,54 because their slopes are opposite
in sign. It is also shown that with the cross-correlation patterns
between aromaticity indexes and information-theoretic quantities,
we are able to distinguish them from each other, so these cross-correlations
include adequate information to unify the two rules with the same
physiochemical understanding. The similar thing also was reported
by Mandado in several cyclic compounds with different spin states,
where a separated scheme of α and β terms was proposed
to uniform the 4n + 2 and 4n aromaticity
for closed-/open-shell annulenes.30

Figure 1 Strong linear
correlation between the Shannon entropy SS and the aromaticity index ASE for 3MR, 5MR, and 7MR systems. Panels
(a,b) are plotted to the triplet and singlet states, respectively.

As a further illustration of the
opposite trends in triplet and singlet states, shown in Figure 2 are linear correlations for
both singlet and triplet states between NICS(0) and four different
information-theoretic quantities, Fisher information,40 information gain,16 Onicescu
information energy of order 3,43 and relative
Rényi entropy of order 3.44 As can
be seen from the figure, linear correlations for the triplet state
are completely opposite to those for the singlet state, suggesting,
again, that the aromaticity propensity of these two states are dictated
by different rules and that using these cross-correlations we should
be able to adequately appreciate the propensity difference of aromaticity
and antiaromaticity for fulvene derivatives and other species alike.
In addition, the opposite changing tendency of aromaticity for singlet
and triplet states agrees well with the results from the substituent
effect. The modest correlation between various substituent constants
and aromatic indexes (shown in Supporting Information Table S6) indicated that these substituent constants could provide
a qualitative description about aromaticity and antiaromaticity for
both singlet and triplet states, similar to the resonance analysis
shown in Scheme 2.

gain, IG, Onicescu energy of order 3, E3, and Relative Rényi entropy of order
3, R3r, respectively.

4 Concluding Remarks
As a continuation of our
recent efforts to appreciate and quantify molecular aromaticity and
antiaromaticity with information-theoretic quantities, in this work,
we have investigated the applicability of our earlier results to the
triplet state for a series of fulvene derivatives using the cross-correlation
pattern between aromaticity indexes and information-theoretic quantities
as a gauge of molecular aromaticity. To that end, we made use of four
aromaticity indexes and eight information-theoretic quantities and
examined a total of 22 substituted fulvene derivatives. We compared
the results both in singlet and triplet states. The following is what
we have discovered in the present work. Predictions of molecular aromaticity
and antiaromaticity for the triplet state using aromaticity indexes
such as HOMA and NICS are often unreliable and inconsistent. Using
information-theoretic quantities alone will not do the job either
because their numerical values usually fluctuate slightly around an
average value. However, if these two categories of properties are
combined and cross-correlations between aromaticity indexes and information-theoretic
quantities are employed, better understanding on the nature and propensity
of aromaticity and antiaromaticity can be accomplished. Historically,
the triplet state aromaticity is governed by Baird’s 4n rule. With cross-correlation results from this study,
we have not only demonstrated the validity of this rule but also shown
that Hückel’s rule for the singlet state aromaticity
and Baird’s rule for the triplet state aromaticity share the
same theoretical foundation because with the cross-correlation patterns
between aromaticity indexes and information-theoretic quantities we
are able to distinguish them from each other simultaneously.

5 Computational Details
Dubbed as the aromatic chameleon
and examined by a few of previous studies,19 fulvene derivatives are capricious in aromatic behaviors.17,48 They can be either aromatic or antiaromatic as their behaviors are
greatly influenced by the nature of substituting groups, ring sizes,
fused rings, spin states, and coordinated ions.17,18,31,48,55−57 We choose this system for the
present study precisely for this reason. Scheme 1 exhibits the systems studied in this work,
including tria (3MR), tetra (4MR+ and 4MR– with one positive
and negative charge, respectively), penta (5MR), hexa (6MR+ and 6MR–,
with one positive and negative charge, respectively), and hepta (7MR)
fulvene derivatives. The substituting group R was chosen from the
following pool, R = H, CH3, CCH, CMe3, CN, CONH2, COCH3, CF3, CC–,
COO–, F, B(OH)2, OH, OCH3,
O–, NH2, NO2, NO, NMe2, NH3+, NN+, and SiMe3, with the criterion that the optimized structure should be
planar, which is one of the prerequisites for aromaticity. Scheme 1 also shows the total
number of π electrons on the fulvene ring of different ring
sizes. For the triplet state of fulvene derivatives, we are only concerned
with the triplet state in this work. Shown in Scheme 2, as illustrative examples, is the resonant structure of 3MR,
5MR, and 7MR with different kinds (electron donor and acceptor) of
substituents leading to different aromaticity propensities in the
singlet and triplet states governed by Hückel’s and
Baird’s rules,20,21 respectively.

Scheme 1 Seven Fulvene Derivatives
were Considered
Here R is B(OH)2, CC–, CCH, CF3, CH2–, CH3, CMe3, CN, COCH3, CONH2, COO–, F, H, NH–, NH2, NH3+, NMe2, NN+, NO, NO2, O–, OCH3, OH,
and SiMe3. All of these structures are denoted by the ring
size and net charge as well as the substituting group R. For clarity,
the total number of π electrons is also shown. Each ring size
is color coded.

Scheme 2 Qualitative Interpretation of Aromaticity
from Hückel’s and Baird’s Rules, Using 3MR, 5MR,
and 7MR as Examples
All singlet-state and triplet-state structures listed
in Scheme 1 were optimized
at the M062X/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory58,59 with the tight SCF convergence criterion and ultrafine integration
grids using Gaussian 09, Revision D.01 package.60 The vibrational frequency was calculated to ensure the
final structures obtained have no imaginary frequency. The Multiwfn
3.4.0 program developed by one of current authors was used to calculate
information-theoretic quantities, NICS(1)ZZ of nonplanar rings, MCI, and HOMA based on the final optimized structure
obtained. In the Multiwfn calculation,61 the spherically averaged electron density of neutral atom at the
same theoretical level was employed as reference. To perform the atomic
partition, Becke’s fuzzy atom approach,62 Bader’s zero-flux atoms-in-molecules criterion,63 and Hirshfeld’s stockholder approach
are possible.64 As have been demonstrated
earlier, these approaches yield qualitatively similar results.65 Here, the Hirshfeld’s stockholder approach
was selected to partition atoms from molecule to obtain each atomic
information-theoretic quantities. The arithmetic average of atoms
in the cycle was used for the description of aromaticity. A dummy
atom at the geometric center of heavy atoms in the cycle was added
for the NICS(0) calculation, and, meanwhile, two dummy atoms 1 Å
above and 1 Å below the cyclic center were added to calculate
NICS(1) and NICS(1)ZZ.13,66 The arithmetic average of the two sides was employed as the cyclic
aromatic index. The unit of NICS and information-theoretic quantities
is parts per million and atomic unit, respectively, whereas for HOMA
and MCI are dimensionless indexes. The difference of electronic energies
of the isodesmic reaction was used as the aromaticity ASE index with
the unit of kJ/mol.
