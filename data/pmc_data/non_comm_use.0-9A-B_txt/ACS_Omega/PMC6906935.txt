In this work, using ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) and zirconium oxide (ZrO2) as laser-sensitive
particles
and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as the matrix resin, a series
of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites were
prepared by melt blending, and the effect of the laser marking additive
content, composition, and laser marking parameters on the laser marking
properties of composites was investigated. The laser marking mechanism
of Fe3O4/ZrO2 additives and the role
of each component in TPU laser marking were studied by metallographic
microscopy, color difference test, scanning electron microscopy, and
Raman spectroscopy. Fe3O4 nanoparticles as a
laser sensitizer component, on the one hand, can act as a pigment
to make the TPU substrate black and, on the other hand, can absorb
laser energy to contribute to the formation of laser markings on TPU
composite surfaces. In addition, the introduction of ZrO2 nanoparticles can help absorb the laser energy, while the contrast
can be improved to enhance the laser marking performance of the TPU
composite. Through thermogravimetric analysis, the changes in the
thermally stable properties of TPU composites before and after laser
marking were investigated, and the results indicated that Fe3O4/ZrO2 nanoparticles can absorb the laser
energy, causing melting and pyrolysis of the TPU backbone at a high
temperature, to produce a gaseous product resulting in foaming. Finally,
the high-contrast and light-colored markings were formed on the black
TPU composite surface. This work provides a facile method for producing
high-contrast and light-colored markings on the dark TPU composite
surface.

==== Body
Introduction
Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is a
commonly used engineering
thermoplastic elastomer with excellent properties such as high strength,
high toughness, wear resistance, and oil resistance. It has been widely
used in the field of medical, food packaging, automotive, aerospace,
anticorrosion coating, electronic devices, and so forth.1−7 In general, TPU products need to be decorated or marked on their
surface in industry, and markings such as barcodes, QR codes, anticounterfeiting
marks, and company logo fabricated directly on the surface provide
clear product information, longevity, product traceability, and anticounterfeiting
capabilities. However, the widely used screen and ink printing methods
for fabricating markings and patterns have many disadvantages such
as the use of toxic solvents and organic volatile compounds polluting
the environment, high production cost, and easy fading.8,9 Therefore, the development of a facile method for fabricating high-contrast,
long-lasting, and environmentally friendly markings on the surface
of TPU products has become an issue to be studied.

Laser marking
is a newly developed pattern-marking technique that
uses a laser generator to generate a high-energy, high-power, continuous
laser beam that focuses on the surface of the material to discolor
it. The surface of a typical laser-irradiated material shows black
marking by carbonization,10 light/white
marking by foaming, and color changes by the photothermal reaction.11 In recent years, laser marking technology has
been used in the fields of metals,12−14 ceramics,15,16 plastics,17−19 and wet soft materials.20,21 Compared with the conventional printing method, laser marking is
a fast and flexible process technology and more environmentally friendly,
and the contrast and durability are also improved. General-purpose
polymer materials such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and
TPU do not absorb laser energy well, physical or chemical changes
are difficult to occur, and high-definition and contrast laser marking
patterns cannot be obtained.18,22 In order to improve
the laser marking performance of such materials, it is usually a viable
solution to add laser-sensitive pigments to the matrix resin. The
laser-sensitive additives are capable of absorbing laser energy well
and causing local overheating, leading to carbonization and formation
of black markings. Laser marking sensitizers are mainly classified
into inorganic,18,19,23 organic,24,25 and polymer/inorganic composite
materials.21,26,27 Wen et al.19 studied the use of graphene
in the field of polymer laser patterning. It was found that graphene
could act as an effective 1064 nm near-infrared (NIR) pulsed laser
absorber, and the addition of only 0.005 wt % (50 ppm) graphene to
the polymer materials led to very excellent laser marking properties.
Because of the high photothermal conversion ability of graphene, the
discoloration of the polymer surface is achieved by the local carbonization
of the polymer caused by graphene. Cheng et al.26 and Zhang et al.27 reported
the preparation of polymer/inorganic laser-sensitive particles with
polymers of easy carbonization as the shell and laser-sensitive inorganic
oxide particles as the core by physical and chemical modification,
respectively. The core–shell structure combines the excellent
photothermal conversion efficiency of the inorganic oxide particles
with easy carbonization and high char residue characteristics of polymers
including polycarbonate and polyimide. The introduction of the laser-sensitive
additive with the core–shell structure into the polymer matrix
resin can produce a high-contrast and clear pattern on the surface
of the polymer, which contributes to the synergistic effect of the
carbonization of the polymer and the photothermal reaction of the
inorganic laser-sensitive particles. The above research work provides
an important reference to design and prepare high-contrast laser marking
materials, which is beneficial to solve the problem that it is difficult
to carry out black carbonization marking on the surface of materials
such as TPU.

So far, Liu’s team investigated the use
of Bi2O3,18 Sb2O3,23 and BiOCl28 as laser-sensitive additives and introduced
them into TPU by melt
blending to achieve laser-markable properties of TPU. The inorganic
laser-sensitive particles can absorb the laser energy and convert
it into thermal energy, causing the surrounding TPU chains to carbonize
to form a black marking. Most of the research efforts have focused
on producing black carbonization marks on white or light-colored TPU
surfaces, and less research has been reported on the production of
light or white marks on black TPU substrates. Compared with the black
carbonization mark, the generation of the light-colored marking requires
the material to generate a gaseous decomposition product and foam
after the laser irradiation, which is relatively complicated and difficult
to control. Therefore, the study of light or white marking on TPU
black substrates is of great significance for expanding the application
of laser marking of TPU materials.

Fe3O4 nanoparticles are a class of magnetic
particles that have been widely used in materials and biological research
because of their unique magnetic response properties, nontoxicity,
and excellent biocompatibility. In recent years, many studies have
used the NIR laser absorption properties and photothermal effects
of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to carry out cancer treatment.29,30 In this research work, it is proposed to use Fe3O4 nanoparticles as a black pigment to make the TPU substrate
black, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles can also absorb
laser energy and induce a photothermal reaction for marking. ZrO2 is a white pigment particle that has attracted great interest
because of its high thermal stability and chemical inertness. It is
widely used in high-performance ceramics, catalysis, sensing, and
fuel cell applications.31−33 ZrO2 was used in this
experiment to assist in absorbing laser energy and improving contrast
to increase the laser marking property of TPU composites. In this
work, Fe3O4 and ZrO2 were compounded
as laser-sensitive particles, which were added to TPU by melt blending.
The obtained TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composite
was laser-marked by a controlled neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum
garnet (Nd:YAG) laser beam at a wavelength of 1064 nm. The effects
of the Fe3O4/ZrO2 feed ratio and
laser process parameters on the laser marking properties of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites were investigated.
The laser marking mechanism of the Fe3O4/ZrO2 laser marking additive and the formation of high-contrast
and light-colored markings on TPU composites were studied by metallographic
microscopy, color difference test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
and Raman spectroscopy.

Results and Discussion
In order to illustrate the necessity
of laser marking of TPU, the
NIR laser response performance of pure TPU materials was first characterized.
Pure TPU samples were laser-marked with different laser current intensities,
and the visual appearance of the surface of pure TPU before and after
laser marking is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen from Figure 1 that compared to the unmarked TPU, the laser-marked
TPU did not show any changes after laser irradiation at the laser
current intensity of 8 and 14 A. As the laser current intensity was
increased to a very high value of 20 A, the color of the surface becomes
deeper and deeper and a few black spots appear, which means that the
laser marking performance of pure TPU cannot be clearly distinguished
from the original color. The formation of black spots can be explained
that when the laser current intensity was very high, the pyrolysis
and carbonization of a small amount of TPU chains occurred. Therefore,
pure TPU cannot absorb laser light energy at 1064 nm, and it is necessary
to introduce a suitable laser marking additive to enhance the laser
marking property of the TPU material.

Figure 1 Visual appearance of the surface of pure
TPU before and after laser
marking at a laser current intensity of (a) 0, (b) 8, (c) 14, and
(d) 20 A.

Figure 2 shows visual
appearance of markings on the surfaces of TPU composites with different
Fe3O4 contents at a laser current intensity
of 12 A and the same ZrO2 content (0.2%). From Figure 2, it can be seen
that in the absence of addition of Fe3O4, TPU/0.2%
ZrO2 itself exhibits a light-colored background, and it
is difficult to form a laser marking with a sharp contrast after laser
irradiation. Note that the area inside the red dotted frame is the
area irradiated by the laser. This is because ZrO2 itself
is a white inorganic pigment that is added to the TPU to give the
entire material a white background. There is no significant color
change or foaming generated after laser irradiation, but ZrO2 can be used to adjust the contrast of the marking on the TPU surface.
As the content of the black Fe3O4 pigment increases
from 0 to 0.1%, the background color of TPU becomes black and a light-colored
marking pattern is produced after laser irradiation; thus, the contrast
between the light-colored mark and the black background gradually
increases, and the color of the marking pattern also changes from
gray to light color. When the Fe3O4 content
is increased from 0.1 to 1%, under the same current intensity and
ZrO2 content, the laser marking color becomes black and
gradually approaches the TPU background color, resulting in a decrease
in the contrast of the laser-marked pattern. In order to better characterize
the laser marking property of the TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composite with the change of the Fe3O4 pigment content, a colorimeter was used to quantitatively test and
analyze the color difference of the marking pattern in this study.

Figure 2 Visual
appearance of markings on the surfaces of TPU composites
with different Fe3O4 contents at a laser current
intensity of 12 A. (a) TPU/0.2% ZrO2, (b) TPU/0.05% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2, (c) TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2, (d) TPU/0.2% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2, (e) TPU/0.5% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2, and (f) TPU/1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2. A red dotted square indicates the area irradiated
by the laser.

Figure 3 shows the
ΔE value of the laser-labeled TPU composite
with increasing Fe3O4 content at a laser current
intensity of 12 A. As can be seen from Figure 3, when the Fe3O4 content
is 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1%, the ΔE values
of the laser marking patterns on the surface of TPU composites are
2.56, 10.28, 36.19, 28.69, 13.11, and 8.12, respectively. From Figure 3, the laser marking
performance of TPU composites increases with the increase of Fe3O4 content from 0.05 to 0.1%. When the Fe3O4 content is 0.1%, the ΔE of the
marking pattern reaches a maximum value of 36.19. After reaching the
maximum value, ΔE decreases with the increase
of Fe3O4 content from 0.1 to 1%. This peak appears
because the formation of a light-colored marking pattern on the surface
of the black substrate is related to the foam generation in the matrix
during laser irradiation. Under laser irradiation, Fe3O4 particles can absorb laser energy and undergo photothermal
conversion. Local overheating causes TPU to melt, carbonize, and degrade
into gas products. The change of both Fe3O4 content
and laser current intensity leads to the foaming of the surface materials
to be different in severity, resulting in a light-colored marking
pattern different from the color of the TPU substrate background.
However, Fe3O4 itself is a black pigment. When
the Fe3O4 content is increased, the blackness
of the TPU substrate becomes also deeper. The light color mark generated
by foaming itself is not obvious. Therefore, there is a peak in the
curve of the ΔE value of the laser-labeled
TPU composite with the increase of Fe3O4 content
at the same laser current intensity.

Figure 3 ΔE value of the
laser-marked TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites
at a laser current
intensity of 12 A as a function of Fe3O4 content.

In order to further explore the effects of the
Fe3O4/ZrO2 feed ratio and laser marking
process on the
laser marking performance of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites, the color difference test was used to quantitatively
analyze the laser marking pattern, and the comparison and analysis
of the results obtained by different conditions were carried out. Figure 4 shows the change
of the ΔE value of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites containing different amounts of
Fe3O4 and ZrO2 as a function of laser
current intensity. It can be seen from Figure 4a that when the Fe3O4 content is 0.05% and there is no ZrO2 addition or the
ZrO2 content is lower (0.01 or 0.02%), the ΔE value of the laser-marked TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites is increased with the increase of the
laser marking current intensity. A higher laser marking current intensity
leads to more laser energy being absorbed by the inorganic laser-sensitive
particles, which is more favorable for the photothermal reaction to
take place. Therefore, the chain of TPU breaks to generate gas bubbles,
which is beneficial for the formation of light-colored markings. With
the increase of ZrO2 content in the composite, the ΔE curve of the laser marking pattern gradually shifts upward,
and when the ZrO2 content is 0.5%, ΔE reaches the maximum value of 24.94 at the laser current intensity
of 18 A. When the laser current intensity is further increased to
20 A, ΔE has a downward trend, that is, the
laser marking has the largest ΔE value at the
laser current intensity of 18 A. When the ZrO2 content
is less than 0.2%, the ΔE value is still in
an upward trend at a laser current intensity of 20 A.

Figure 4 ΔE value of the laser-marked TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites with different Fe3O4 contents
[(a) 0.05% Fe3O4; (b) 0.1% Fe3O4; (c) 0.2% Fe3O4; (d) 0.5% Fe3O4; (e) 1% Fe3O4] as a function
of laser current intensity.

It can be seen from Figure 4b that when the Fe3O4 content is 0.1%
and ZrO2 is not added, ΔE of the
laser-marked TPU composite increases to 36.31 with the current intensity
from 8 to 14 A. When the laser marking current intensity continues
to increase to 16, 18, and 20 A, the ΔE values
are 41.5, 41.67, and 41.43, respectively, gradually becoming stable.
At the same Fe3O4 content and the ZrO2 content of 0.01%, ΔE of the laser-marked
composite follows the same law as the increase of the laser current
intensity. However, when the ZrO2 content is 0.02%, the
ΔE curve of the composite after laser mark
increases first and then decreases, and ΔE reaches
the maximum value of 40.54 at a laser current intensity of 16 A. When
the ZrO2 content is higher than 0.02%, the ΔE curve of the laser-marked composite also shows a trend
of increasing first and then decreasing, and ΔE reaches a maximum value of about 40 at the laser current intensity
of 14 A.

From Figure 4c,
it can be found that when the Fe3O4 content
is 0.2% (larger than 0.1%), ΔE of the laser-marked
TPU composite with different ZrO2 contents increases first
and then decreases with the increase of the laser current intensity
and reaches the maximum value of around 31 at the laser current intensity
of 10. As shown in Figure 4d,e, when the Fe3O4 content is 0.5 or
1% (larger than 0.1%), ΔE of the laser-marked
TPU composite with different ZrO2 contents decreases with
the increase of the laser current intensity. The largest ΔE value of the laser marking was found to be less than 26
at the smallest laser current intensity of 8 A.

Comparing the
results of the laser-marked composites with different
Fe3O4/ZrO2 contents and laser current
intensities in Figure 4, it is found that the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/ZrO2 composite shows the best laser marking performance (see Figure 4b). In this research
work, the laser marking current intensity of 12 A was used in the
field of TPU marking. On the one hand, the whole polymer degradation
can be avoided without using a high laser current intensity, and on
the other hand, a lower laser marking current intensity can also save
energy, which requires a lower laser current intensity to achieve
higher laser marking performance. In general, in order to reduce the
laser current used to achieve the most excellent laser marking property,
it is necessary to increase the content of laser-sensitive Fe3O4. However, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, when the Fe3O4 content is increased, the laser marking performance
is rather decreased. This requires the addition of another laser marking
additive ZrO2 to reduce the laser current intensity used
to achieve optimal laser marking. Using the laser marking current
intensity of 12 A and the Fe3O4 content of 0.1%,
the composite materials containing 0.2 and 0.5% ZrO2 both
can achieve better marking property, and the corresponding ΔE values can be 36.15 and 37.43, respectively. Because the
ΔE difference between two laser-marked samples
is not large, the ZrO2 content of 0.2% and the Fe3O4 content of 0.1% were chosen to obtain the TPU composite
with the largest ΔE of 40.34 at the laser current
intensity of 14 A. It can be seen that a better laser marking property
can be achieved with a lower current intensity under the conditions
of a suitable TPU composite composition. It can be also concluded
that Fe3O4 absorbs laser energy in the composite
material and causes photothermal reaction, which enhances the absorption
capacity of the composite material to the laser. In this case, increasing
the content of ZrO2 at a lower Fe3O4 content results in a decrease in the laser current intensity required
for the composite to achieve maximum laser marking. In this study,
a reasonable selection of the content of Fe3O4 and ZrO2 and the laser marking current intensity in TPU
composites can fully exhibit the ability of the inorganic oxide particles
to absorb the laser light energy and undergo the photothermal conversion,
and achieve the high-contrast and light-colored marking performance
of TPU composites.

Figure 5 shows the
metallographic microscopy image of the marked and unmarked areas of
the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite
at different laser current intensities. It can be seen from Figure 5a,d that when the
laser current intensity is 8 A, it is difficult to find foams on the
surface of the composite material, and it is almost impossible to
distinguish the boundary between the laser-marked and unmarked areas.
When the laser current intensity is increased to 14 A, as shown in Figure 5b,e, a regular strip-like
bulge appears on the surface of the composite material. The laser-marked
area is in contrast with the unmarked area, and the unmarked area
shows a flat surface. When the laser current intensity is 20 A, as
shown in Figure 5c,f,
a large number of convex bubbles appear in the laser marking area
and the marked area is obviously higher than the unmarked area, and
the surface thickening phenomenon is more obvious. After the laser
irradiation, bubbles appear on the surface of the TPU composite. The
inorganic laser-sensitive particles generate a local high temperature
by absorbing the laser energy, which causes the surface TPU to melt,
degrade, and produce gaseous decomposition products, resulting in
surface bulging and foaming. As the intensity of the laser marking
current increases, the penetration depth of the laser into the composite
is deeper. More inorganic oxide particles can absorb the laser energy
and release heat so that the TPU material degrades faster and produces
more gaseous decomposition products. Under the action of gas, the
molten TPU is squeezed out of the surface by the gas and the bubbles
on the surface of the composite material are gradually dense, and
bubbles gradually agglomerate and then cool to form a rugged surface.
Thus, there are two mixed phases of bubbles and substrate solids at
the foaming point, and such a mixed phase has a high refractive index
so that the foamed portion exhibits a very noticeable light-colored
marking.

Figure 6 shows transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the laser-sensitive particles
and SEM images of the cross-section of TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composites. It can be seen from Figure 6a,b that the ZrO2 and Fe3O4 particles both have regular
morphology and uniform size, which are 18 ± 1 and 165 ±
18 nm, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 6c,d that the Fe3O4 and
ZrO2 particles are uniformly distributed in the TPU matrix,
and it is found that a pore structure appears on the cross-section
of the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite
after laser marking, which is related to the foaming pore structure.
The refractive index of the mixed phase changes, resulting in the
formation of light-colored markings and the marked color differences
between the marked and unmarked areas. From Figure 6c, it can also be estimated that the penetration
depth by laser marking is approximately 100 μm deep from the
surfaces without damaging the properties and structures of the whole
TPU composites. The experimental results also verified the analysis
of the metallographic microscope.

Figure 7 shows the
water contact angle of the surface of the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite at different laser marking
current intensities. It can be seen from Figure 7 that the water contact angle of the unmarked
composite material is 75.5°. After laser marking, the water contact
angle of the composite marking surface increases to 77.0° at
the laser marking current intensity of 8 A. When the laser current
intensity is 14 and 20 A, the water contact angle of the composite
material can reach 98.0 and 95.5°, respectively. This phenomenon
can be explained by the generation of foaming after laser marking
the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite
material. In combination with Figure 6, it can be seen that many tiny bumps were formed on
the surface of the composite material, which is similar to the surface
of the lotus flower. The structure formed makes the surface of the
material more hydrophobic, which increases the water contact angle
of the Fe3O4/ZrO2/TPU composite.
This hydrophobicity makes it possible to make the laser-marked areas
more difficult to be obscured by water stains and thus helping to
maintain the sharpness of the marking pattern during use. Figure S1 shows the infrared spectra of the TPU/0.1%
Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite before
and after laser marking. It can be seen from Figure S1 that there is no obvious new characteristic absorption peak
appearing before and after laser marking. The laser irradiation most
likely only affects the surface of TPU and will not substantially
change the structure of TPU.

Figure 7 Water contact angle of the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composites before and after laser
marking varies
with the laser current intensity.

Figure 8 shows the
Raman spectra of the TPU/Fe3O4 and TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites before and after
laser marking. It can be seen from Figure 8 that the spectrum of the TPU/Fe3O4 composite before laser marking showed several peaks
at 2059, 2921, 1611, 1440, 1305, 1176, 866, and 636 cm–1, and it is rather difficult to find the relevant peak of Fe3O4 nanoparticles because of the more intensified
signals of TPU chains. Note that the characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 nanoparticles appear at 1308, 598, 494, 395,
282, and 215 cm–1, which is shown in Figure S2a
of the Supporting Information. Compared
with the unmarked TPU/0.1% Fe3O4 composite,
the Raman spectrum of the marked TPU/0.1% Fe3O4 composite shows a broad diffusion band of amorphous carbon in the
range of 1000–2000 cm–1, which is in agreement
with the result reported in the literature.28,34 After adding 0.2% of ZrO2 laser-sensitive additive to
the TPU/Fe3O4 composite for laser marking, it
can be found that the intensity of the broad diffusion band assigned
to amorphous carbon decreases, which indicates that the addition of
ZrO2 nanoparticles exacerbates the degradation of TPU and
produces more gaseous products. Therefore, the degree of foaming on
the TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites after
laser marking is increased. In contrast, the degree of carbonization
blackening caused by the Fe3O4 laser-sensitive
particles is weakened so that the marked area is closer to a light
color. This explains that although the laser marking current intensity
is reduced after the addition of the ZrO2 powder, a better
marking performance is obtained. Figure S2b (see the Supporting Information) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composite
before and after laser marking. It can be seen that the TPU composites
showed a similar XRD spectra before and after laser marking, which
indicates that the laser marking has not caused changes in the crystal
structure of Fe3O4 and ZrO2. Both
Raman and XRD results indicated that the laser marking additive plays
the role of light absorption and heat transfer during the laser marking
process, and its crystal structure has not been changed.

laser marking.

Figure 9 shows the
TGA and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composites before and after
laser marking at a laser current intensity of 12 A. Table 1 shows the TGA characteristic
data of the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite before and after laser marking. As can be seen from Figure 9, T2%, T5%, Tmax1, and termination temperatures of the composites before
and after laser marking decreased by about 14, 7, 14, and 22 °C,
respectively. This indicates that the thermal stability of TPU decreases
to some extent after laser marking. This is because when irradiated
with laser, Fe3O4 and ZrO2 particles
inside the TPU composite can absorb the laser energy, undergo photothermal
reaction, and release heat. Therefore, the TPU molecular chain breaks
and decomposes to cause carbonization and foaming of the TPU composite.
TPU is composed of soft segment polyol and hard segment isocyanate.
It can be seen from Figure 9b that the DTG curve of the composite shows two peaks, the
first peak appears at about 350 °C, corresponding to the decomposition
of hard segment isocyanate. Petrović et al. and Pielichowski
et al. also reported that the degradation of PU in the first stage
takes place mainly in hard segments.35,36 The weight
loss phenomenon of the TPU caused by the second peak occurs at 400
°C, which corresponds to the thermal decomposition of the soft
segment polyol to cause weight loss due to the small molecule gas
or macromolecular volatile matter. After laser marking, it can be
seen that the peak area corresponding to the hard segment decomposition
in the DTG curve tends to decrease because in laser marking, the TPU
chains on the surface of composites are decomposed into a gaseous
product in advance because of high temperature. This means that there
is a generation of harmful gases during laser marking, so the use
of lower laser marking current intensity appears to be important in
industrial applications.

In order to compare the effect of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites prepared by this research
work with commercial
laser marking powders, the commercial Merck L8835 laser marking powder
was introduced into the TPU system, and ΔE obtained
by the colorimeter was used to quantify the laser marking pattern
(see Figures S3, S4, and S5, Supporting Information). Figures S3 and S4 show the laser marking
pattern of the TPU/L8835 composite at the laser current intensity
of 14 A and the corresponding ΔE as a function
of L8835 content. It can be seen from Figures S3 and S4 that when the content of L8835 is 0.01, 0.05, 0.1,
0.2, and 0.5%, the ΔE values of the laser marking
pattern on the TPU composite are 8.26, 13.41, 32.94, 28.98, and 18.32,
respectively. At the same time, the ΔE curve
of the laser marking pattern of TPU/L8835 composites with the laser
current intensity is also studied (Figure S5). Using the laser current intensity of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and
20 A, the ΔE values of TPU/L8835 composites
after laser marking are 5.25, 20.31, 27.64, 32.94, 34.59, 34.73, and
33.34, respectively. It can be seen that as the laser current intensity
increases, there is a maximum ΔE value of laser
marking patterns on the TPU/L8835 composite materials. Therefore,
to achieve the best laser marking performance, the L8835 content of
the TPU/L8835 composite material is 0.1% and the optimum laser marking
current intensity is 14 A.

Figure 10 shows
the comparison of the visual appearance of laser marking QR code patterns
on TPU composites made from TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2%
ZrO2 and TPU/L8835 composites. It can be seen from Figure 10 that compared
with TPU/L8835 composites marked at 12 and 14 A, the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite shows a higher
ΔE value and better laser marking performance.
From the perspective of effectiveness and energy saving, the TPU/0.1%
Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite material
was selected and laser-marked at the laser current intensity of 12
A to achieve QR code patterns, which can be well recognized by the
smart mobile phone app and can be quickly linked to the official web
of Changzhou University. The TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2%
ZrO2 composite material achieved better laser marking performance
while using a lower laser current intensity in laser marking.

Conclusions
The TPU material itself does not produce
significant color change
after laser marking. For the TPU material, a suitable laser marking
additive must be added to achieve good laser marking performance.
After adding the Fe3O4/ZrO2 laser
marking additive to the TPU material, the surface of the black TPU
material can be light-colored and has a significant contrast effect
before and after marking. In the Fe3O4/ZrO2 laser marking additive system, the laser marking property
of TPU composites increases first and then decreases with the increase
of Fe3O4 content. The laser current intensity
used for the optimal value of laser marking property can be decreased
after the addition of the suitable amount of ZrO2 to the
TPU composite, which is helpful for reducing energy consumption. The
TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites achieved
the best laser marking performance corresponding to a ΔE of 40.34 when the content of Fe3O4 was 0.1%, the content of ZrO2 was 0.2%, and the laser
marking current intensity was 14 A. When the laser marking current
intensity was 12 A, the good laser marking performance with a ΔE of 36.15 was achieved. It can be concluded that the role
of the laser marking additive in the TPU composite is to convert the
absorbed light energy into thermal energy so that the TPU melts, the
molecular chain breaks, carbonizes, and a gaseous product is produced.
However, during the marking process, pyrolysis carbonization of the
TPU occurs, making the marking black, and the addition of an appropriate
amount of ZrO2 nanoparticles can reduce the occurrence
of such carbonization. Compared with the TPU composites incorporated
with the commercial laser marking powder L8835, the TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2 composite has a higher
ΔE value, exhibit better marking performance,
and is more easily recognizable. In this study, a facile method for
fabricating a high-contrast and light-colored laser marking on the
surface of black polymer materials has already been developed, which
will be helpful for the research and development of the TPU-based
laser marking materials.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Materials
TPU (U-285AL) was purchased
from Taiwan Kunzhong Co., Ltd., and the analytically pure antioxidant
1010 (Irganox 1010) was purchased from BASF, Germany. ZrO2 nanoparticles of analytical grade (particle size 18 ± 2 nm)
were obtained from Nanjing Shanshan New Materials Technology Co.,
Ltd. Fe3O4 nanoparticles (99.5%, particle size
165 ± 18 nm) were obtained from Adamas-Beta Reagent Company (Shanghai,
China).

Preparation of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 Composite Samples
TPU pellets, antioxidant 1010, Fe3O4, and ZrO2 powders were dried in a
vacuum oven at 70 °C for 8 h. In order to avoid the degradation
of the TPU chains during thermal processing, the antioxidant 1010
should be added in TPU composites. Then, the quantitative TPU particles
were weighed according to the selected formula, and then, the required
mass of antioxidant 1010 (0.5 wt %), Fe3O4,
and ZrO2 powders was accurately measured (see Table S1
in the Supporting Information), which were
subsequently mixed well with TPU pellets in a torque rheometer at
the temperature of 190 °C. A 2 mm-thick sheet sample was produced
at 190 °C using a flat vulcanizer under a pressure of 10 MPa.

Table S1 (Supporting Information) shows
all TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composite formulations
made by using 60 g of TPU as the matrix resin. In order to avoid degradation,
0.3 g of the antioxidant 1010 (0.5 wt %) was added. In this formula,
a controlled variable method was used to explore the optimum ratio
of Fe3O4 and ZrO2 for the best laser
marking performance and the role of each component in the laser marking
process. The mass of Fe3O4 added to TPU was
preset as 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.3, and 0.6 g, respectively, so as to
study the effect of the change of the Fe3O4 content
on the laser marking performance of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites. According to the amount of Fe3O4, 35 formulas were divided into 5 groups, and each group
of 7 formulations contained a ZrO2 content of 0, 0.006,
0.012, 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.3 g, in order to investigate the effect
of the change of the ZrO2 content on the performance of
each group. For example, the final sample code “TPU/0.1% Fe3O4/0.2% ZrO2” indicates that
it was prepared from 60 g of TPU, 0.06 g of Fe3O4, and 0.12 g of ZrO2.

Laser Marking of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 Composite Samples
The marking on the sheet sample was carried
out by a pulsed laser beam of Nd:YAG (KDD-50, Suzhou Kaitai Laser
Technology Co., Ltd., China) at a wavelength of 1064 nm. The laser
marking machine process parameters include the laser focal length
of 219 mm, spot size of 100 μm, laser pulse repetition frequency
of 4000 Hz, and laser scanning speed of 450 mm/s. The laser current
intensity used is set to 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 A, which are
corresponding to 18.5, 23.5, 28.5, 33.2, 37, 42.3, and 47 W, respectively.

Instruments and Characterization
The X-Rite 7000A color
difference spectrometer (X-Rite, USA) was used to test the surface
color difference (ΔE) of TPU/Fe3O4/ZrO2 composites before and after laser marking.
The effect of different laser additive contents and different laser
marking currents on the laser marking performance of TPU composites
was studied. ΔE is introduced using Commission
Internationale de I’Eclairage (CIE) L*a*b* coordinates in this work. ΔE can be defined as the numerical comparison of a sample’s
color to the standard. It indicates the differences in absolute color
coordinates. Defined by the CIE, the L*a*b* color space was modeled after a color-opponent
theory stating that two colors cannot be red and green at the same
time or yellow and blue at the same time. As shown in the equation
below, L, a, and b indicate lightness, the red/green coordinate, and the yellow/blue
coordinate, respectively. Before laser marking, these values can be
recorded as L0, a0, and b0. After laser marking,
these values can be recorded as L1, a1, and b1. ΔL (L1 – L0), Δa (a1 – a0), and Δb (b1 – b0) may be positive (+) or negative (−). The total
difference, ΔE, however, is always positive
and calculated as follows 1  

ΔE was used
to determine the laser marking performance of composites before and
after laser marking. The larger the value of ΔE, the more obvious is the marking contrast.

The laser-marked
and unmarked areas of TPU composites were observed
and compared using a metallographic microscope (ECLIPSE-LV150N, Nikon),
and the marking boundary positions were observed to study the change
characteristics before and after laser marking.

The water contact
angle tester (JC2009D1 goniometer, Shanghai Zhongchen
Digital Technology Equipment Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) was used to
determine the change of the water contact angle before and after laser
marking.

The laser-marked region of the TPU composite before
and after laser
marking was tested using a Nicolet Avatar 370 Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer with a spectral range of 4000–400 cm–1.

The samples were first frozen in liquid nitrogen and then
broken
off. The gold layer was sprayed on the section, and the cross-sections
of the composites were observed using a JEOL (JSM-IT100, accelerating
voltage 10 kV) scanning electron microscope. The morphology and size
of the inorganic particle were measured by dispersing the inorganic
particles in ethanol, dropping them on a copper mesh, and using a
JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (acceleration voltage
200 kV).

The XRD spectra of samples were obtained using a powder
diffractometer
(RINT2000, Rigaku). The TPU composites before and after laser marking
were tested using a DXR laser confocal microcontrolled Raman spectrometer
(Thermo Science and Technology Company). The sample was tested in
different positions and the tests were repeated three times in order
to reduce the error.

The surface materials of the laser-marked
and unmarked TPU composite
were analyzed using a NETZSCH-TG 209 F1 thermogravimetric analyzer
(NETZSCH, Germany) in a nitrogen atmosphere (gas flow rate of 20 mL/min).
The heating rate was 20 °C/min, and the scanning temperature
ranged from 30 to 700 °C.
