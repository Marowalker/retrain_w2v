The
leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally are cardiovascular
diseases, and nanomedicine can provide many improvements including
disease-specific targeting, early detection, and local delivery of
diagnostic agents. To this end, we designed fibrin-binding, peptide
amphiphile micelles (PAMs), achieved by incorporating the targeting
peptide cysteine-arginine-glutamic acid-lysine-alanine (CREKA), with
two types of amphiphilic molecules containing the gadoliniuim (Gd)
chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), DTPA-bis(stearylamide)(Gd),
and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[(poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG))-2000]-DTPA(Gd) (DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd)).
The material characteristics of the resulting nanoparticle diagnostic
probes, clot-binding properties in vitro, and contrast enhancement
and safety for dual, optical imaging–magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) were evaluated in the atherosclerotic mouse model. Transmission
electron micrographs showed a homogenous population of spherical micelles
for formulations containing DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd), whereas both spherical
and cylindrical micelles were formed upon mixing DTPA-BSA(Gd) and
CREKA amphiphiles. Clot-binding assays confirmed DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd)-based
CREKA micelles targeted clots over 8-fold higher than nontargeting
(NT) counterpart micelles, whereas no difference was found between
CREKA and NT, DTPA-BSA(Gd) micelles. However, in vivo MRI and optical
imaging studies of the aortas and hearts showed fibrin specificity
was conferred by the peptide ligand without much difference between
the nanoparticle formulations or shapes. Biodistribution studies confirmed
that all micelles were cleared through both the reticuloendothelial
system and renal clearance, and histology showed no signs of necrosis.
In summary, these studies demonstrate the successful synthesis, and
the molecular imaging capabilities of two types of CREKA-Gd PAMs for
atherosclerosis. Moreover, we demonstrate the differences in micelle
formulations and shapes and their outcomes in vitro versus in vivo
for site-specific, diagnostic strategies, and provide the groundwork
for the detection of thrombosis via contrast-enhancing agents and
concurrent therapeutic delivery for theranostic applications.

Introduction
Atherosclerosis contributes
to cardiovascular diseases, the leading
cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.1 Atherosclerosis is characterized as a chronic, inflammatory
disease, and its progression is typically slow and asymptomatic until
a clinical event occurs such as a myocardial infarction or stroke.2−4 Many patients who die from sudden cardiac arrest have no prior reports
or symptoms of their underlying disease. Current imaging modalities
for atherosclerosis diagnostics use imaging techniques that focus
on the severity of the blockage within arteries. However, the majority
of plaques that rupture occlude <50% of the vessel diameter.5 Therefore, early detection of unstable plaques
is needed and requires imaging techniques that provide information
on plaque composition and not just based on size alone.

Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is an important imaging modality
for vascular occluding diseases.6 A variety
of approaches to detect vulnerable plaques in atherosclerosis have
emerged, but the main advantages of MRI as compared to conventional
techniques such as computed tomography, X-ray angiography, and intravascular
ultrasound is its ability to image and characterize the blood vessel
wall and plaque in a noninvasive manner. Moreover, MRI avoids patient’s
exposure to ionizing radiation, limiting possible long-term health
implications. Nonetheless, whereas MRI has the ability to image and
generate contrast between health and diseased soft tissues based on T1 and T2 relaxation times and proton density
(PD), contrast-enhanced MRI methods can better discriminate vulnerable
plaques by accumulating contrast agents in the diseased vessel wall
without significantly enhancing normal vessels.

Recent developments
in nanomedicine and molecular engineering have
improved the design of contrast agents by incorporating molecular
targeting ability to disease pathology, as well as strategies to enhance
half-life while minimizing toxicity.7 Specifically,
peptide-based nanomaterials are particularly useful for these applications
as the peptide is often a biological epitope for tissue-specific homing,
with inherent biocompatible and biodegradable characteristics.8−10 To that end, we have previously incorporated the fibrin-targeting
peptide, cysteine-arginine-glutamic acid-lysine-alanine (CREKA), previously
found through in vivo phage display, into supramolecular, peptide
amphiphile micelles (PAMs) for targeting unstable, atherosclerotic
plaques displaying microthrombi.11−14 Rupture of unstable plaques,
presaged by the appearance of microthrombi, leads to activation of
thrombin, fibrin deposition, and ultimately occluding clots.15Imaging
vessels in which clotting is taking place has the potential to enable
intervention and reduction of blood vessel occlusion and expansion
of clots through preventative therapies.

Individual peptide
amphiphile (PA) molecules consist of a hydrophilic,
peptide “head group” and a lipid, alkyl “tail”,
which self-assemble above its critical micelle concentration (CMC)
via hydrophobic forces.16,17 PAMs can include a
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) protective shell between the peptide and
aliphatic tail that provides pharmacokinetic properties favorable
for enhanced bioavailability, and deliver contrast agents and drugs
in the optimum dosage range, reducing toxic side effects.18−20 Moreover, notable characteristics of PAMs include their multivalent
display of peptides presented on the exterior and multifunctionality
through the combination of several amphiphilic monomers, advantages
for targeted, diagnostic applications.11,21

Our
earlier studies in the apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE KO) murine
model confirmed that CREKA-PAMs accumulate in the shoulder region
of late-stage plaques, a region where fibrin deposition and microthrombi
are present and most likely to rupture, and are mostly cleared out
of the body within a week without adverse effects.11,12 This is an important aspect to contrast agent development because
recent reports have found deposits of contrast agents accumulated
in the brain of cadaver patients with repeated imaging, spurring FDA
investigation for safety.22 Through targeting,
less contrast agents can be used overall, providing a safer tool particularly
for such patients.

To incorporate the molecular targeting ability
of PAMs and the
diagnostic performance of MRI, the objective of this study is to develop
micelles that can be utilized as molecular MRI contrast agents for
plaque localization and visualization using T1-weighted
imaging for atherosclerosis. We synthesized and combined two types
of amphiphilic molecules containing the gadoliniuim (Gd) chelator
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) into CREKA-PAMs: one molecule
that is commercially available and previously incorporated into other
micelle-based MRI systems (DTPA-BSA(Gd))23 and another synthesized for the first time and consisting of the
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(PEG)-2000 (DSPE-PEG2000) backbone (DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd)).
Gd-based MRI contrast agents typically fall into two groups: linear
Gd(III) chelates and macrocyclic chelates. Macrocyclic chelates have
higher thermodynamic and kinetic stability than that of linear chelates
and so we chose DTPA-Gd as the macrocyclic chelator in both instances.24 Whereas previous studies have incorporated commercially
available gadolinium chelators into nanoparticles, we show, for the
first time, DTPA(Gd) within the DSPE-PEG2000 backbone of CREKA-PAMs,
and provide structural data as well as comparisons between the nanoparticles
consisting of varying Gd-amphiphilic molecules regarding targeting
in vivo. The novel design and synthesis of combining gadolinium, optical
imaging probes, and targeting ligands in PAMs for MRI applications
are provided as well as comparisons between nanoparticles, an important
aspect to designing particles for clinical translation. We evaluated
the material characteristics and relaxivity measurements for MRI feasibility,
tested and compared fibrin-targeting capabilities in vitro, and demonstrate
contrast enhancement and safety of both micelles as contrast agents
in the atherosclerotic mouse model.

Results and Discussion
Preparation,
Characterization, and Comparison of Fibrin-Binding
PAMs for MRI
Two types of fibrin-binding PAMs for MRI were
self-assembled, one of which was mixed with DTPA-BSA(Gd) (commercially
available) and another with DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd) (Figure 1A). DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd) was
obtained by reacting diethylenetriamine-N,N,N″,N″-tetra-tert-butyl acetate-N′-acetic acid
(DTPA-tetra) to DSPE-PEG(2000)-amine to form a peptide bond. The tert-butyl groups of DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA-tetra were deprotected
and Gd ions were chelated onto the amphiphile by adding Gd(Cl3). Free Gd ions were separated by a desalting column, and
all molecules were purified after each step and confirmed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry
(Figure S1). A total of four types of micelles
were constructed: (1) CREKA/DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd), (2) nontargeting
(NT)/DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd), (3) CREKA/DTPA-BSA(Gd), and (4) NT/DTPA-BSA(Gd).
All micelles consisted of 45:45:10 mol % DSPE-PEG2000-CREKA, DSPE-PEG2000-methoxy/DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd),
or DTPA-BSA(Gd)/DSPE-PEG2000–cy7 to maximize targeting capabilities,
MRI contrast, and fluorophore signal. The optimal concentration for
PAMs was previously determined to be 10 mol % cy7 without quenching
the fluorescence signal.,20

SB: 20 nm (B–E1), 100 nm (D2, E2).

Spherical micelles with an average diameter of 8.7–12.4
nm was confirmed via TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure 1B–E2 and Table 1). Upon sterile filtering
(0.1 μm, poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)), TEM confirmed
the presence of a heterogeneous population of micelles consisting
of both spherical and cylindrical micelles for PAMs consisting of
DTPA-BSA(Gd) (Figure S2). DTPA-BSA(Gd)
micelles also had a larger population of particles (Figure S3), likely reflecting the cylindrical micelles present
in solution. This was also the case for CREKA-PAMs consisting of DSPE-DTPA(Gd),
another commercially available chelator (Figure S4). In addition to charge repulsion, DTPA-BSA(Gd) and DSPE-DTPA(Gd)
lacks the PEG45 linker, which contributes to the larger
hydrophilic head group found in DSPE-PEG2000-based amphiphiles and
the packing parameter that dictates spherical shape, which may explain
these observations.17 Notably, the apparent
darkness of the electron micrographs showed variability in all cases,
suggesting that the amount of DTPA(Gd)-containing molecules also varied.
The cylindrical micelles derived from DTPA-BSA(Gd)-containing mixtures
were lighter in appearance, suggesting less Gd incorporation.

When PAMs were constructed with various DSPE-PEG(2000)-CREKA to
DTPA(Gd) molar ratios, an increase in Gd led to a decrease in T1 measurements at 1.5 T,25 confirming
the tunability of % Gd incorporation and contrast-enhancing properties
of PAMs for MRI (Table 2). An anomaly to this trend are the longitudinal relaxation times
for PAMs consisting of >75 mol % Gd for DTPA-BSA-based micelles,
in
which there was an increase. This phenomenon may be due to the distance
of paramagnetic ions to one another within micelles as reported for
other nanoparticles.26,27T1 measurements
of micelles were similar to that of water without the presence of
Gd.28

Plaque Targeting of Clots in Vitro and in Atherosclerotic Mice
The fibrin-targeting ability of various CREKA-PAM formulations
was first investigated using an in vitro clot-binding assay (Figure 2). Fibrin-containing
clots were formed by incubating human plasma with thrombin. After
polymerization, the clots were incubated with CREKA/DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd),
NT/DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd), CREKA/DTPA-BSA(Gd), or NT/DTPA-BSA(Gd).
After 1 h, clots were washed with PBS, digested with nitric acid,
and Gd ions quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS). Whereas CREKA-targeting and NT micelles consisting of DTPA-BSA(Gd)
did not have any significant binding differences, CREKA/DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd)
formulations showed over 8-fold greater binding compared with their
NT counterparts (Figure 2B). The higher binding of CREKA/DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd) could be explained
by a more uniform mixture of the DSPE-PEG2000-CREKA (or NT) and DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd)
molecules within the micelle versus the DTPA-BSA(Gd)-based micelles,
where shape heterogeneity as well as the contrast provided by the
Gd in the electron micrographs varied (Figure 1). As cylindrical micelles appeared lighter,
this may indicate less overall Gd but more CREKA PA incorporation,
which could contribute to an overall lower Gd measurement even if
micelles targeted to a large extent. Further studies will design amphiphiles
with both the targeting peptide and the chelating molecule into one
amphiphile to interrogate this phenomenon.29 Moreover, electrostatic interactions may contribute to fibrin binding
of DTPA-BSA(Gd) micelles; controls scrambling the CREKA sequence or
mutating the sequence (E → D and K → R) will be used
to validate specificity of targeting in future studies.

(A) clot-binding assay and (B) quantification of micelle
binding to clots in vitro by ICP-MS.

Next, the targeting ability of nanoparticles was tested in
vivo
using the ApoE KO mouse (Figure 3). ApoE KO mice are homozygous for the Apoetm1Unc mutation and show an increase in total plasma cholesterol levels,
lesions by 3 months, and can be induced with advanced stages of atherosclerosis
using a Western diet.30 Three-month-old
mice were fed a high-fat diet for 3 months, and nanoparticle formulations
were administered intravenously before T1-weighted
MRI of the aorta, approximately 1 h after micelle injection; the addition
of gadolinium increases the T1 relaxation rate of
nearby water protons, providing positive contrast or a bright signal.
Unlike the in vitro binding assay, coronal scans of the aortic arch
showed an increased in contrast of CREKA micelles consisting of either
DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd) or DTPA-BSA(Gd) compared to their NT micelle
counterparts (Figure 3A). These results were further confirmed via quantification, although
no statistical differences were found (Figure 3B). However, in addition to T1-weighted imaging, future T2-weighted and proton-density-weighted
imaging may further discriminate plaque anatomy and composition and
provide additional insights into targeting and imaging potential of
CREKA micelles. Next, hearts and the aortas were excised and imaged
using optical imaging, and the average photon flux was quantified
(Figure 3C,D). Similarly,
CREKA micelles consisting of either DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd) or DTPA-BSA(Gd)
had increased fluorescence signal (CREKA vs NT DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA(Gd)
2.4 × 108 vs 1.5 × 108 and CREKA vs
NT DTPA-BSA(Gd) 1.9 × 108 vs 1.7 × 108 p/s/cm2/sr). This was also the case for total flux (Figure S5). These differences between in vitro
and in vivo targeting confirm the importance of animal studies, and
one explanation could be the presence of a protein corona upon adsorbing
components in plasma, neutralizing the targeting advantage and benefits
found in vitro.31,32 Future studies varying PEG length
of the different PAs will be useful in reducing nonspecific protein
adsorption and optimizing clot-binding and uptake. Figure S6 nonetheless shows immunohistochemistry staining
of fibrin present within the aorta.

Biodistribution and Histology
Figure 4A provides biodistribution of nanoparticles
throughout the brain, lung, liver, spleen, intestines, kidney, and
bladder after approximately 90 min postinjection using optical imaging.
All micelles primarily accumulated in the liver and the spleen with
a moderate amount of uptake found within the kidneys and bladder as
compared to the rest of the organs (Figure 4B). This is consistent with previous findings
demonstrating that micelles are cleared through renal excretion as
well as the monocyte phagocytic system (MPS, also called the reticuloendothelial
system or RES).12 Our micelles are on the
smaller end of nanoparticle size, which render them capable of both
glomerular filtration by the kidneys and elimination by macrophages
via MPS.33−35 As micelles are self-assembling and dynamic nanoparticles,
it is also possible that some amphiphilic monomers bind with the target
and cause micelle disassembly. As a result, nonbound monomers are
cleared through the bladder. This process would likely occur multiple
times as particles are recirculated throughout the body, ultimately
saturating the target sites and diluting the particle concentration
below the CMC. The ability for our nanoparticles to (1) target and
image diseased tissues and (2) be cleared in a timely and appropriate
manner may be an advantage as a diagnostic system, particularly to
those patients undergoing recurring imaging sessions; this is in contrast
to current MRI agents in which deposits found in the brain have triggered
investigations regarding their safety.36 Future studies interrogating the targeting and clearance properties
of dynamic versus crosslinked particles versus monomers will help
further tailor our design for diagnostic versus therapeutic applications
that require varying half-lives and clearance properties. Previous
studies showed that over 90% of micelles are cleared by 7 days.37

Histopathological evaluation
of major organs, including kidneys,
spleen, and liver, using hematoxylin and eosin staining showed no
signs of cellular or tissue damage and did not detect abnormal lesions
upon administration of any micelle type (Figure 5). Tissue morphology was comparable to organ
structures obtained from mice injected with PBS, confirming the safety
of these micelles as MRI contrast agents. This is consistent with
previous in vitro data assessing biocompatibility of Gd-incorporated
PAMs via Live/Dead assay. Altogether, fibrin-binding micelles as contrast-enhancing
agents for atherosclerosis was demonstrated in vivo. Longer time points
and additional animal studies will further delineate the full potential
of targeting and enhancement, duration of signal enhancement, as well
as clearance rate in future studies.

Conclusions
In this study, we designed micelle-based
diagnostic agents for
imaging fibrin-containing atherosclerotic plaques in vivo, and the
potential of targeting plaques and dual, optical imaging–MRI
was provided. Fibrin targeting was demonstrated by incorporating CREKA
PAs with various Gd-chelating molecules, and the resulting micelle
was characterized. Whereas in vitro studies confirmed that a uniform
amphiphile backbone and micelle shape homogeneity had a large contribution
to the clot-targeting capability, in vivo studies showed fibrin specificity
was conferred by the peptide ligand without much difference between
the nanoparticle formulations. Larger animal experiments will further
interrogate the binding differences between the nanoparticle types
in future studies. Despite the high level of mortality, the cardiovascular
field has not benefited to a similar degree as cancer from recent
advances in nanomedicine. Applications of medical nanotechnology toward
cancer far out-number those to cardiovascular disease by orders of
magnitude. Similarly to cancer applications, nanomedicine can bring
numerous powerful advantages, including early detection by amplification
of small signals, local delivery of diagnostic contrast agents and
therapeutics, and simultaneous delivery of a battery of agents. Our
study that incorporates and compares fibrin-targeting micelles containing
Gd-chelators can expand nanoparticle use in cardiovascular diseases
and will lay the groundwork for targeted delivery of micelles for
the detection of thrombosis via contrast-enhancing agents and concurrent
therapeutic delivery for theranostic applications.

Materials and
Methods
Synthesis and Construction of Micelles
CREKA [Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala]
peptides were synthesized via Fmoc-mediated solid-phase peptide synthesis
methods using an automated PS3 Benchtop Peptide Synthesizer (Protein
Technologies, Tucson, AZ) on rink Amide resin (Anaspec, Fremont, CA),
as previously described.37 CREKA peptides
were cleaved and deprotected with 94:2.5:2.5:1 by volume trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA)/1,2-ethanedithiol/H2O/triisopropylsilane, dissolved
in water, lyophilized, and stored as powders at 20 °C until use.
Peptides were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (Prominence, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) on a C8 column (Waters,
Milford, MA) at 50 °C using 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile/water mixtures
and characterized by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectral analysis (Biflex
III; Bruker, Billerica, MA). CREKA peptides were conjugated via a
thioether linkage to DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide (Avanti Polar Lipids,
Alabaster, AL) via the cysteine. After reaction at room temperature
(RT) for 24 h, the PAs were purified and characterized as described
above.

Gadolinium (Gd)-containing DSPE-PEG(2000) amphiphiles
were synthesized by reacting DTPA-tetra (Macrocyclics, Dallas, TX)
to DSPE-PEG(2000)-amine (Avanti Polar Lipids) in 1:1 molar ratio in
dimethylformamide via a peptide bond. DSPE-PEG2000-DTPA-tetra was
precipitated and purified as described above. The tert-butyl protecting groups were removed in 12 M HCl for 2 h before
pH neutralization and purification via HPLC (C4 column). Gd ions were
chelated onto the amphiphile by adding Gd(Cl3) (Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) in a 1:1 molar ratio in 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.5)
for 1 h, and free Gd ions were separated by a PD-10 desalting column
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). All amphiphiles in
this study were characterized by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectral analysis
(Biflex III, Bruker, Billerica, MA).

Cy7 mono-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was covalently attached to DSPE-PEG(2000)-amine
by an amide bond to form fluorescently labeled amphiphiles. Molecules
were dissolved in 10 mM aqueous sodium carbonate buffer (pH 8.5) and
after 24 h of reaction, the mixture was purified on a C4 column and
characterized by HPLC and MS as described above.

DSPE-PEG(2000)-DTPA(Gd)-containing
PAMs were constructed by dissolving
DSPE-PEG(2000)-CREKA, DSPE-PEG(2000)-cy7, and DSPE-PEG(2000)-DTPA(Gd)
in methanol, mixing the components, and evaporating the mixture under
nitrogen gas. The resulting film was dried under vacuum, and hydrated
at 70 °C for 60 min in PBS under sonication, and allowed to cool
to RT. Control, NT-Gd PAMs were self-assembled by using DSPE-PEG(2000)-OCH3. CREKA-PAMs consisting of commercially available Gd-chelators
were assembled by adding DTPA-bis(stearylamide)(Gd) (DTPA-BSA(Gd))
or DSPE-DTPA(Gd) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL).

Micelle Characterization
Micelle samples for TEM were
prepared by placing 6 μL of 50 μM of nanoparticle solution
on 400 mesh lacey carbon grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) for 5 min.
Excess liquid was wicked away with filter paper and the grid was washed
with Milli-Q water. Dried samples were imaged on a JEOL 1230 TEM (JEOL,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

A total of 500 μM micelle solutions
consisting of DSPE-PEG(2000)-CREKA or DSPE-PEG2000-OCH3 with DSPE-PEG(2000)-DTPA(Gd) or DTPA-BSA(Gd) (1:1) were assessed
by DLS. DLS measurements were determined at 90° and 637 nm using
a Brookhaven Instruments (Holtzville, NY) system consisting of a BI-200SM
goniometer and a BI-9000AT autocorrelator.

The T1 relaxation times of micelles were measured
at 1.5 T Philips Achieva scanner (Philips, Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). T1 longitudinal relaxation times were measured using vials
containing 100 μM PAMs with varied ratios of DSPE-PEG(2000)-CREKA
and DSPE-PEG(2000)-DTPA(Gd) or DTPA-BSA(Gd). The T1-mapping sequence consisted of a fast spin echo inversion recovery
(FSE-IR) with varying inversion times (TIs). The FSE-IR acquisition
parameters were as follows: TR = 12 s; TE = 15 ms; TI = 50, 100, 250,
500, 750, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 ms; acquisition voxel size
of 1 mm × 1 mm and 5 mm slice thickness. Software written in
Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) was used to analyze data. The FSE-IR
images were fit, using a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm,
on a voxel-by-voxel basis to the signal model (eq 1)  where M(TI) is the measured
signal at each TI and Mo is the equilibrium
magnetization. These fits provided a T1 value for
each voxel. Regions of interest (ROI) within vials were used to calculate
the average T1 values of PAMs. ROIs had a cross-sectional
diameter of 9 mm in the acquisition plane, in the calculated T1 maps.

Clot Binding of Micelles in Vitro
To test targeting
ability of CREKA-PAMs, fibrin-containing clots were made according
to established methods.38 Specifically,
225 μL of human plasma (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was diluted
in 75 μL of 100 mM CaCl2 before adding 5 units of
thrombin. After 5 min, clots were incubated with 500 μM PAMs
for 1 h, washed with PBS 3 times, and digested in nitric acid. PAM
binding was quantified by measuring Gd ions via ICP-MS (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA).

MRI of Atherosclerosis in a Murine Model
Female, 12
week old, transgenic mice homozygous for the Apoetm1Unc mutation (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)
were fed a high-fat diet that consists of 21% (w/w) fat, 0.15% (w/w)
cholesterol, 19.5% (w/w) casein, and no sodium cholate (Harlan, Indianapolis,
IN) for 12 weeks to generate plaques.39 All animals were anesthesized using isoflurane and underwent a preinjection
baseline, MR scan (coronal plane) and reference images were obtained
via T2-weighted spin echo (repetition time/echo time:
4000/20 ms; rare factor: 4, sinc3 pulse 450 μs, excitation/refocusing
flip angle: 90/180°; field of view (FOV): 2.56 × 2.56 cm2, slice thickness: 500 μm, resolution: 100 μm2) at the Lynn S. Florsheim MRIS Lab at the University of Chicago.40−43 CREKA or NT micelles with either DSPE-PEG(2000)-DTPA(Gd) or DTPA-BSA(Gd)
(45:45:10 mol % Gd/PA/cy7 amphiphile, 400 μL, 1 mM in PBS, N ≥ 3) were injected intravenously via a tail-vein
catheter. Immediately
after micelle administration, MRI scans of the aorta were performed
using TOF (repetition time/echo time: 10.9/1.75 ms; flip angle: 60°;
FOV: 2.56 × 2.56 cm2, slice thickness: 500 μm,
resolution: 100 μm2) and lasted approximately 90
min. An inflow saturation band of 3 mm was used with a slice gap of
3 mm for additional luminal flow suppression, and a saturation pulse
was used to eliminate background signal and minimize chemical shift
artifacts. Imaging slices were matched to precontrast images and background
subtracted using ImageJ software. To quantify the MRI results, the
signal of the aortic arch was normalized by the muscle signal and
signal intensity measurements of ROIs was quantified via ImageJ. All
animal studies were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines and
were approved by the University of Chicago’s IACUC (Chicago,
IL).

Biodistribution and Histological Assessment
After optical
imaging and euthanasia, the brain, heart, aorta, lung, intestines,
liver, kidney, spleen, and bladder were collected for biodistribution
and histological assessment. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging was
conducted using an IVIS 200 and fluorescence signal quantified via
Living Image software (Perkin Elmer, Downers Grove, IL). Organs were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were
placed in a solution of 30% sucrose for 8 h and frozen in OCT (Tissue
Tek, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA). Samples were then cryosectioned
via a cryostat (Microm HM 525, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA),
and 5–7 μm sectioned were stained with hemotoxylin and
eosin (H and E), and imaged (DMI6000 B, Leica Microsystems, Inc.,
Buffalo Grove, IL). Images provided are representative sections.

To assess fibrin expression, mouse, rabbit, anti-mouse fibrinogen
α was used on aortic sections (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, sc-33580). Secondary antibodies included biotinylated
rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:200, 10 μg/mL, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, BA-1000) and antigen–antibody binding was detected
by the Elite standard Vectastain ABC kit (PK-6100; Vector Laboratories)
and DAB (K3468; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) system.

Statistical Analysis
Student’s t-tests were used to compare
two groups, whereas analysis of variance
using Newman–Keuls multiple comparison test post-hoc analysis
determined significant differences among three or more groups. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered to be significant.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD or SEM.
