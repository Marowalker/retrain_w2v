Here, the high sensitivity and enhanced
photochromic efficiency
of the hybrid film of solar wavelength conversion phosphor and photochromic
film for functional smart window have been achieved by fabricating
a double-layered hybrid structure of wavelength conversion phosphor
and photochromic film. Y2SiO5:Pr3+ phosphor nanoparticles, which upconvert visible light to UV light,
were synthesized by simple hydrothermal method. The synthesized Y2SiO5:Pr3+ nanoparticle was coated as
layered structured film on photochromic H3PW12O40 film. The Y2SiO5:Pr3+/H3PW12O40 hybrid film showed an
enhanced sensitivity and efficiency of photochromic process with solar
light irradiation due to the increased UV portion of solar light through
upconversion process of visible light by wavelength conversion phosphor
layer. The increased UV portion by upconversion process of Y2SiO5:Pr3+ layer through excited-state absorption
and energy transfer upconversion process, contributed to an enhancement
of coloration rate of photochromic H3PW12O40 film by 7 times with 50 min of 1 sun irradiation due to
fast conversion of W6+ state to W5+ state in
H3PW12O40 film with 5 times enhanced
photochromic sensitivity compared with pristine photochromic film.

1 Introduction
For
energy saving, smart windows, which change optical transmittance
according to the light intensity of external environments, have attracted
much attention because of their ability to control the transmission
intensity of IR light.1 This technology
can reduce the energy consumption of buildings by maintaining inside
temperature in a homeostatic state. The switchable smart windows can
be operated by external parameters such as the electricity, light
irradiation, or heat through the electrochromic,2−4 photochromic,5−7 or thermochromic processes, respectively.8 Several previous researches on smart window have been focused on
the electrochromic smart window for its durability. However, electrochromic
smart window has limitation because the additional electric system
is needed to operate it, leading to the high installation cost. In
case of thermochromic windows, it is hard to be utilized because high-temperature
(∼70 °C) condition is required.9−11 Among those
kinds of smart window systems, photochromic windows are cost effective
because they do not need additional device or heating system for the
photochromic process. Photochromism, the essential concept for photochromic
windows, is based on the ability of visible and IR light transmittance
control derived from the color change due to the molecular structure
or oxidation state change between two different states with different
thermodynamic energy levels. Generally, the photochromic phosphotungstic
acid (H3PW12O40, HPW) film has been
changed to colored one by exposing to UV light and turned back to
colorless one under visible-light irradiation.5,7,12,13 HPW, one of
the polyoxometalate compound, has the photochromic properties due
to reduction of tungsten metal ion from W6+ to W5+ through charge transfer from oxygen to metal under UV light irradiation.14 The advantage of smart window of HPW film is
that it can absorb the UV light and be colored, controlling the visible-light
intensity by coloration density of the HPW film.6,15−18 However, the small portion of the UV region in solar light (∼5%)
limits the efficiency of photochromic smart windows because most of
the photochromic films of HPW are active under the UV light absorption.
Hence, increasing the UV light intensity of the incident solar light
could be a promising key technology to improve the efficiency of the
photochromic HPW smart windows. The ways to breakthrough those limitations
of HPW are to increase the portion of the UV light in the irradiated
solar light spectrum by upconverting visible or IR range of the solar
light with phosphor material. For the efficient solar light upconversion
and downconversion, lanthanide metal ions such as Pr3+,
Tm3+, Eu3+, and Er3+ are widely used,
which are doped into the host materials. Because those ions have the
4fn electronic configurations and exhibit
f–f transitions, which allow the activation process of the
excited electron transitions.19 The representative
photo-upconversion and photo-downconversion materials are La2O2S:Er3+ or Yb3+,20 NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+,21 NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+,22 and Y2SiO5:Pr3+.23 Among those materials, a praseodymium-doped
yttrium silicate (Y2SiO5:Pr3+, YSO:Pr3+) is the best phosphor material that can emit UV light by
absorbing visible light of solar light via wavelength conversion.
The YSO:Pr3+ is excited by absorbing the visible light
(∼505 nm) and emits UV light (270–380 nm) through the
wavelength-upconversion process. This upconverting phosphor emits
a photon with a higher energy than that of absorbed photons through
the excited-state absorption (ESA) and energy-transfer upconversion
(ETU).24,25 Previous studies on the application of the
downconversion and upconversion materials for increasing visible light
portion of the solar light have been reported an enhanced performance
of dye-sensitized solar cell or energy storage system.26−29

Herein, we report the first application for smart window film
by
getting Y2SiO5:Pr3+/H3PW12O40 double-layer hybrid film of phosphor
layer for solar wavelength upconversion and photochromic layer. The
YSO:Pr3+ upconverting thin layer (UCM layer) on the surface
of photochromic HPW film (PCM film). The upconverting properties of
UCM layer were measured by photoluminescence spectroscopy and light
absorption properties and coloration rate of PCM film and UCM–PCM
double-layer hybrid film were measured by UV–vis spectroscopy.
The upconversion from visible light to UV light by nanosized YSO:Pr3+ particle layer (UCM layer) resulted in a dramatic enhancement
in efficiency and kinetics of photochromic process with solar light
irradiation of PCM film by supplying a higher intensity of UV light
toward the PCM film through the upconversion of incident solar light.

2 Results and Discussion
The Y2SiO5 nanoparticles (YSO) with 1, 5,
10, and 15 mol% Pr3+ (YSO:Pr 1, YSO:Pr 5, YSO:Pr 10,
and YSO:Pr 15, respectively) were successfully synthesized via hydrothermal
method and confirmed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1a–e). The
shape of the synthesized YSO and YSO:Pr particles was spherical and
they aggregated easily. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the
synthesized YSO were matched with representative standard YSO patterns
within 29.71, 31.02, 32.52, and 33.64°, which corresponded to
the plane of (−202), (211), (−212), and (−221)
(PDF#52-1810, C2/c space group with
monoclinic), respectively.30 As the Pr3+ ions were doped into YSO, there was little low 2θ
angle shifting, indicating the change in d-spacing
distance of the crystal structure due to Pr3+ doping into
the YSO crystal.

XRD patterns of YSO and YSO:Pr (all scale bars are 100 nm).

The electrons in ground state
of Pr3+ ion in YSO are
excited by absorbing visible light of 505 nm and transferred 
higher energy to the other Pr3+ ions in YSO during the
decay through the double excitation procedure. The double-excited
electrons reached the intermediate state of 4f5d band of the Pr3+ ion, emitting UVC light during the decay to ground state
(Figure S1).31,32 The detailed
size and morphology of YSO and YSO:Pr3+ clusters were investigated
by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image.
The size of YSO and YSO:Pr3+ clusters was determined as
around 40 nm with undesignated morphologies (Figures 2a–e and S2). In the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of each
YSO particle (Figure S3), the d-spacing value of (−212) plane also showed an increase from
0.271 to 0.276 nm after doping Pr3+ into YSO due to larger
radius of Pr3+ ion compared with Y3+ ion.

TEM-energy-dispersive system (EDS) analysis data for Pr atomic ratio
in each sample (all scale bars are 10 nm).

The atomic ratios of Pr3+ in YSO:Pr3+ were
determined as 0, 0.56 at%, 2.68 at%, 6.45 at%, and 8.5 at% for YSO,
YSO:Pr 1, YSO:Pr 5, YSO:Pr 10, and YSO:Pr 15, respectively, with TEM-EDS
(Figure 2f) and detailed
EDS spectra for YSO and YSO:Pr3+ (Figure S4). These are consistent with lattice d-spacing
values of SAED patterns. These results were well matched with XRD
data in Figure 1f,
and the lattice d-spacing values were increased after
Pr3+ doping into YSO. The binding energy and chemical oxidation
state of YSO:Pr3+ were revealed by the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The O 1s spectra of YSO:Pr3+ showed a peak at the binding energy of 527.5 eV, which is typical
O 1s peak position in YSO (Figure S5a).
The Si 2p spectra of YSO:Pr3+ showed a peak at the binding
energy of 98 eV and Y 3d spectra of YSO:Pr3+ showed two peaks
at the binding energy of 154 eV for Y 3d6/2 and 156
eV for Y 3d8/2, which is well matched with the typical
binding energy of Si and Y in YSO (Figure S5b,c).33

In the XPS spectra of Pr3+ 3d, peaks of Pr3+ 3d6/2 and Pr3+ 3d8/2 appeared at
the binding energy of 930 and 950 eV, respectively, whereas the peak
intensity was increased with increasing atom % of Pr3+ in
YSO:Pr3+ (Figure S5d). The photoluminescence
spectra of YSO:Pr 1, YSO:Pr 5, YSO:Pr 10, and YSO:Pr 15 are shown
in Figure 3a.

spectra for YSO:Pr3+ particles with different

(b) Emission intensity of YSO:Pr3+ particles with different
molar ratios of Pr3+ ions (1, 5, 10, and 15 mol%).

According to the photoluminescence
measurement of YSO:Pr3+, YSO:Pr 1 showed the highest photoluminescence
intensity, which
decreased as doped Pr3+ ratio was increased. This tendency
was also shown in the calculated area under emission spectra in Figure 3b. YSO:Pr 1 showed
an enhanced emission intensity over 200% compared with that of YSO:Pr
5. It is believed that the concentration of doped Pr3+ ions
higher than 5  mol% leads to high luminescent quenching,
thus inhibiting the double-excitation process in YSO:Pr3+.34,35

Phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40, HPW) changes the color due to the
oxidation state change of W ions
by absorbing UVA light. In the XPS spectra, when HPW was bleached,
the dominant oxidation state of W ion is W6+ state with
37 eV binding energy, whereas the dominant state of W6+ ion was changed to W5+ state with 34 eV binding energy
during colored state through photochromic reaction by UV-light irradiation
(Figure S6). The mechanism of this coloration
process was revealed based on the reduction from W6+ state
to W5+ state by electron transfer from O 2p orbital in
HPW to W d0 orbital.36,37 The transferred electron
from O 2p to W d0 results in the oxygen vacancies, and
those oxygen vacancies suppress the electron–hole recombination
by trapping the photogenerated oxygen radicals, thus enhancing the
photochromic efficiency.16,38 The double-layered
hybrid structure of the UCM layer and the PCM film (UCM–PCM
hybrid film) were fabricated by doctor blading method. The upconverting
particles (YSO, YSO:Pr3+) were spread on the oxygen plasma
treated PCM film on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film (Figure 4a). The thickness
of each UCM layer was investigated with cross-sectional SEM images
(Figure 4b–f).
The average thickness both PCM film and UCM layer was determined as
∼50 μm. The scheme of the photochromic process of UCM–PCM
hybrid film is shown in Figure 5a.

The role of UCM layer is to convert visible range
of incident solar
light into UV light through the ESA and ETU upconversion process.
The UV abundant solar light by upconversion process of UCM layer was
irradiated on the PCM film, enhancing the efficiency and kinetics
of the photochromic reaction of the PCM film.

Because the emission
intensity trends of the YSO:Pr3+ particle were the same
as that with the UCM layer with different
amounts of doped Pr3+ ion, the emission spectrum of the
UCM–PCM hybrid film fabricated by 1  mol% of YSO:Pr particle
showed the highest emission intensity (Figure 5b). The emission intensity of the UCM–PCM
hybrid film can be determined by measuring the relative areas under
curves and the results are shown in Figure 5c.

The emission intensity of the UCM–PCM
double-layered hybrid
film fabricated with YSO:Pr 1 shows an enhanced intensity by approximately
30% compared with the UCM–PCM hybrid film fabricated with YSO:Pr
5. The emission intensity difference between YSO:Pr 1 and other YSO:Pr
was increased in the order YSO:Pr 5 > YSO:Pr 10 > YSO:Pr 15
after
UCM layer coating on the surface of PCM film. This is caused by the
higher absorption of visible light and the quenching effect of the
increased at% of Pr3+ ions doped into YSO host matrices,
which decreases the emission intensity of the UCM layer on the PCM
film during photoluminescence spectra measurement (Figure S7a). By attaching the UCM–PCM hybrid film on
the glass, the transmission light intensity in the 450–550
nm range passing through the window was decreased by absorption with
UCM layer. The PCM film has faster kinetics of photochromism from
colorless to dark green by absorbing higher intensity of incident
UV light by changing visible light of 505 nm to UV light through the
double-excitation upconversion process of the UCM layer. The increased
UV light intensity reduces W6+ state to W5+ state
of the PCM film, leading to an enhanced photochromism of light absorption
by the PCM film (Figure S7a). As the solar
light was illuminated on both PCM and UCM–PCM hybrid films
in the same conditions to compare, the total light absorption intensity
of the UCM–PCM hybrid film was higher than that of the PCM
film, which was contrastingly appeared on by the different degree
of color change to dark green between two kinds of films (Figure S7b–e). According to the UV–vis
spectra, the light absorption ability of the PCM film depending on
the solar light illumination time was much lower than that of the
UCM–PCM hybrid film (Figure S8).
The amount of the total light absorption intensity of bare PCM film
and UCM–PCM hybrid film at 400–800 nm versus irradiation
time is shown in Figure 6a. The coloration rate of PCM film is calculated by linear fitting
of coloration curves with the equation like below  where Δt is the irradiation
time of the solar light. Only the PCM films showed coloration rate
of 0.07436, whereas the UCM–PCM hybrid film showed the coloration
rate of 0.5694, being enhanced by 7 times. It indicates that, in the
same irradiation intensity, the UCM–PCM hybrid film shows an
enhanced photochromic kinetics by solar light absorption by 7 times
compared with only PCM film on the window. The kinetic constants during
the photochromic reaction (k) from W6+ to W5+ in PCM by electron transfer were calculated by
the following equation39  where A0 indicates
the solar light absorbance of the PCM film at 450 nm at 0 s, A∞ means absorbance of the PCM film under
the irradiation of solar light for 30 min, and At means solar light absorbance at the irradiation time of t (s). The calculated kinetic constants during the photochromic
reaction by electron transfer from W6+ to W5+ in the PCM film and the UCM–PCM hybrid film are shown in Figure 6b. The average kinetic
constant (k) of UCM–PCM is 0.000166 s–1, which is 5.5 times more sensitive than the PCM only
film with 0.00003 s–1.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
this work on the fabrication of double-layer structured
UCM–PCM hybrid film showed 7 times enhanced photochromic kinetics
by solar light absorption through the photochromic effect of the PCM
film and 5.5 times faster sensitizing rate on solar light compared
with the PCM single-layer film. This is due to the upconversion of
the incident solar light from vis to UV light through the UCM layer
by ESA and ETU process of YSO:Pr3+ in UCM layer. Considering
most of energy losses of buildings happen through the window, this
research suggests the enhanced efficiency and kinetics of the photochromic
film by applying UCM–PCM hybrid films on the smart window.
The introduced method in this work  can contribute to the enormous
energy saving of buildings by absorption of solar energy through solar
light upconverting and photochromism.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Yttrium(II) nitrate tetrahydrate
(Y(NO3)3·4H2O, 99.99%, Aldrich),
praseodymium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Pr(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9%, Aldrich), and sodium trisilicate solution
(Na2O(SiO2)x·xH2O, Mw: 1.39 g
mL–1, Aldrich) were used as yttrium, praseodymium,
and silica precursors, respectively. To adjust the pH value of each
solution, hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35%, PFP) and ammonium hydroxide
solution (NH4OH, 28.0–30.0% NH3 basis,
Junsei) were used. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) methyl ether (CH3(OCH2CH2)nOH, Mn ∼ 5.000, Aldrich) was used
as binder for the paste. Ethanol (C2H6O, ≥99.9%,
Emsure) and deionized (DI) water (>18 MW, Millipore) were utilized
in the reaction and washing process. All of the reagents were used
without further purification. The photochromic film (PCM film, H3(PW12O40)·nH2O) coated on PET substrate (Mapro Ltd.) was used for checking
the photochromic effect with or without an upconversion layer.

4.2 Synthesis of YSO:Pr3+ Nanoparticles
for Fabrication of UCM Layer
Five kinds of Y2–xSiO5:xPr3+ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) phosphor powders
were synthesized using the hydrothermal method based on Chen’s
report with some modifications.19 Y(NO3)3·4H2O (0.1 M) with Pr(NO3)3·6H2O (0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.20, and
0.30 M) were prepared using DI water, and the pH value of the solutions
was adjusted to 10.2 by adding ammonia water. Following the same procedure,
Na2O(SiO2)x·xH2O (0.1 M) solution with DI water was prepared
with pH value of 1.1 by adding HCl solution (2.0 M).

After adjustment
of the pH value, 10 mL of Na2O (SiO2)x·xH2O (0.1
M) was added and mixed under vigorous stirring while 10 mL of Y(NO3)3·4H2O (0.1 M) with Pr(NO3)3·6H2O solution was added dropwise.
The mixture was aged for 1 h. Then, it was transferred to a Teflon-lined
autoclave (20 mL) and kept in an oven at 200 °C for 3 h. The
collected particles were washed three times with water and ethanol
successively using a centrifuge machine at 8000 rpm for 20 min. The
particles were dried at 70 °C for 5 h and finely ground using
an agar mortar. The powder was annealed at 1000 °C for 1 h and
ground using a ball miller for 3 h.

4.3 Fabrication
of the UCM Layer on PCM Film (UCM–PCM
Hybrid Film)
The paste was prepared by mixing 0.4 g Y2SiO5:Pr3+ powder, 0.5 g PEG, and 0.5
mL DI water followed by stirring for 30 min. The PCM film coated on
PET substrate surface was treated with oxygen plasma for 90 s to increase
surface hydrophilicity. The mixture was spread homogeneously over
the treated PCM film surface and coated uniformly using doctor blading
method. The film was dried at 80 °C during 5 min to improve binding
of phosphor nanoparticles with the substrate.

4.4 Characterization
The crystal structure
of the synthesized particles was investigated with X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Rigaku MiniFlex-II desktop X-ray diffractometer, Cu Kα
radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphology of the particles
and the as-made films was observed by using scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Hitachi S-4300) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL,
JEM-2100F, operated at 200 keV). To obtain the emission spectra of
YSO nanoparticle powder, UCM layer, and UCM–PCM hybrid film,
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-700) was used under excitation
wavelength of 505 nm. The function of the UCM film on the PCM film
was investigated using solar simulated light source (Asahi HAL-320,
100 mW cm–2). The solar light was illuminated with
solar simulator with different illumination times on the area of 1
cm2. The optical properties were studied with Varian Cary
5000 UV–vis–NIR Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies).
