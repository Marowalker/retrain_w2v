The nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of meta-nitroaniline (m-NA) are evaluated via Hückel–Agrawal’s
approximation in a solvent environment. In this context, both the 1B and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) electronic
transitions are considered. The benzene ring currents on the clockwise
or counterclockwise direction and the corresponding Brillouin zone
from 0 to π are also considered. Besides, the Bloch equations
were applied to a single cell n = 1 defined on the
benzene ring. We have considered that the light beam was directed
along the ring benzene bonds of m-NA; this topological
hypothesis changed the crystal structure to a linear chain and the
calculated optical properties were found near the experimental ones.
In addition, the Fermi’s golden rule was applied to the crystal
state and then the calculated refraction index of m-NA had an error of less than 3% of the experimental one. On the
other hand, the molar absorptivity ε of m-NA
in acetonitrile for the 1B and intramolecular ICT transitions
was experimentally determined to be 11 981 and 1192 L mol–1 cm–1, respectively. With this methodology,
we found that the change of the charge in the NO2 group
has also a strong influence on the linear and NLO properties. In addition,
the dipole transition moments, which are originated from the carbon
between the carbons joined to NO2 and NH2, are
mainly involved in the NLO properties. Thus, the first hyperpolarizability
βz was 1.69 × 10–30 esu at λLaser = 1064 nm, 27% of the experimental
value. We attribute this difference to the evaluation of the excited
dipole moment. If we attribute a separation of charge of 0.1 e in the excited state, the new dipole moment allows for
the simulation of the experimental value. Besides, the calculated
value of χ(3) for m-NA in a solution
of acetonitrile is 2.9 × 10–13 esu at λLaser = 1064 nm, 158% of the experimental value. The discrepancy
between these values is attributed to the influence of the electronic
correlation effects, that is, because of resonance structures of the
aromatic ring and the zwitterionic pair of nitro and aniline. Besides,
we have also evaluated the second hyperpolarizability γ, the
second-order susceptibility χ(2) of m-NA and their values have similar differences to the experimental
values. This type of approach is important because it reduces computing
time and gives insight into the molecular causes responsible for linear
and NLO properties in this type of functional groups, which can be
used as building blocks in more complex polymer systems.

Introduction
The benzyl moiety is a group that can
be added to polyenyne or
to the polyene chain to improve the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties
of these compounds because the electronic charge can be delocalized
in the benzene ring1 with an increase of
the conjugation. This increase of the conjugation produces a decrease
of the band gap and then an enhancement of the values of the linear
and NLO properties. In this way, it is convenient to analyze the spectroscopic
properties of benzene, particularly the effect of the disubstituents
on its optical properties with the methodology of Hückel–Agrawal’s
approximation applied to a linear conjugated closed chain.2−6 In principle, a special feature of benzene is the presence of ring
currents,7,8 that is, circular currents in the benzene,
which induce a shift in the signal of NMR when a magnetic field is
applied. Thus, the Brillouin zone extends from 0 to π in the
reciprocal space because the electrons make a higher frequency circular
movement around the ring. Then, a pseudoband structure is produced
with the variation of θ, with the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) as a pseudovalence band v and with
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) as a pseudoconduction
band c. In this context, in the notation of the direction
of the ring currents, we have used the Canh–Ingold–Prelog
system9 to assign the priority to the substituents
NO2 and NH2 of the benzene ring. So the carbon
joined to the first-priority group, in this case NO2, is
taken as a reference, and the second carbon in hierarchy is the carbon
bonded to the group NH2, with only a carbon between both
carbons. As a natural fact, the circulation of the ring current can
occur from the substituent selected of the first hierarchy to the
substituent of the second hierarchy in the shortest path and this
direction is named right-rotatory. The opposite direction, that is,
the longest way to the substituent of the second hierarchy, is named
left-rotatory.

In the evaluation of the optical properties of m-NA, it would be expected that the border electronic interactions
at θ = π produce a higher electron–electron interaction
and thus a decrease of the linear and NLO properties of this compound.
Also, the correlation repulsion effects are expected to go up at θ
= π. In this way, an evaluation of the linear and NLO properties
disregarding the border and correlation effects would overestimate
their values. On the contrary, in the case of the substituted aromatics
such as nitroanilines (NAs), it is assumed that a higher number of
stable resonance structures with charge separation increase the conjugation
and, therefore, the optical properties. The larger amount of resonance
structures in ortho-nitroaniline (o-NA) and para-nitroaniline (p-NA)
than in m-NA9 indicates
that their optical properties must be higher than in m-NA. However, the lesser electronic interaction of the resonance
structures of m-NA would decrease the Coulombic on-site
electron–electron repulsion potential U,10 which counterbalances this decrease of the optical
properties.

In relation to the spectroscopic features of benzene,
this compound
has three band maxima:11−13 (177 nm 7.0 eV, 1B or lE1u transition); 203.5 nm (3.04 eV, 1La or lB1u transition); 260 nm (2.38 eV, 1Lb or lB2u). These transitions
have associated a resonance energy β, which is larger at higher
energy of the band maxima. This resonance energy β has a crucial
role in the evaluation of the linear and NLO properties. It is important
to remember that: (1) the electronic transition 1B is symmetry-allowed14 with no resonance and (2) the next lower energy 1La transition is produced by the resonance energy
of the benzene ring.3,15,16 The lowest energy 1Lb transition is produced
by ring-distorting vibrations of type e2g14 which diminish the band gap. In addition, the effects of
these transitions on the optical properties of benzene are given by
the proportion of the molar extinction coefficients:14,17,18 ε(1B) = 66 000,
68 000 L mol–1 cm–1, ε(1La) = 6600 (7400), 8800 L mol–1 cm–1, ε(1Lb) 110 (200,
250) L mol–1 cm–1. Thus, the first
band with a transition in 1B has the highest oscillator
strength and then this band is the most important band for benzene’s
optical properties. Besides, it has been found that if the benzene
aromatic ring presents a pair of donor–acceptor intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) substituents, the NLO properties increase because
of a higher charge delocalization. In the case of NAs, the third-order
NLO properties increase by a factor of 1.4 in the case of o-NA, 1.2 in m-NA, and 2.6 in p-NA in relation to nitrobenzene (γ = 5.7 × 10–30 esu).19 Meanwhile, the dipole moment
in these compounds is increased by a factor of 1.03, 1.2, and 1.5,
respectively, with respect to nitrobenzene (μ = 4.0 D in dioxane).
Thus, the charge redistribution, which produces the variation of the
dipole moment, changes less than the NLO properties in o-NA and p-NA. The higher increase of the NLO properties
indicates that the polarization is rather local.19 In this fashion, the NLO properties in these compounds
are more sensitive to slight band structure dispersions.20 On the other hand, the same proportionality
factor (1.2) in the augmentation of the dipole moment and the NLO
properties in m-NA predicts that the correlation
effects are not as important in this compound.

In this work,
we have analyzed the conjugation present in m-NA
and the importance of its spectroscopic bands on the
linear and NLO properties in the Brillouin zone. The scope of this
work is to analyze the optical properties of benzene and its substituent
in meta by Hückel–Agrawal’s approximation, and
then, simulate the polyenine and polyene polymers with a benzene ring
with a substituent in ortho, meta, and para positions.

Hückel–Agrawal’s
approximation allowed us
to obtain the energies, resonance energies β, and wavefunction
coefficients.4,5,21 The
aim was to gain a physicochemical insight of the background of the
NLO properties of m-NA, which is a question not answered
directly, for instance, by ab initio methods.20 On the other hand, NAs have resonance zwitterionic structures22 with charge separation and, hence, an exciton
arises and also correlation effects must be considered.6 In principle, it is known that the ICT effect
is not present in m-NA via resonance as in o-NA and p-NA19 because the zwitterionic structures of the amine and nitro functionalities
are not correlated in m-NA as seen in Schemes S-1
and S-2 of the Supporting Information.
Thus, the resonance of the NH2 group to the aromatic ring
does not include a resonance from the nitrogen of the group NO2 as seen in Scheme S-1. Indeed,
the resonance of the aromatic ring to the NO2 group is
not correlated because it causes aromatic instability as seen in Scheme S-2. Then, the ICT from the NH2 to the NO2 group is done via a dispersion of the charge,
not by a type of resonance. Bearing this in mind, we have found that
the second harmonic generation (SHG) NLO properties are underestimated
by this Hückel Agrawal’s method and that the χ(3) NLO properties are higher than the experimental ones as
explained below.

Results and Discussion
Energies Calculated for m-NA
As shown
in Figure 1, all the
energies are constant throughout the Brillouin zone. The actual separation
depends on the value of β2 because the normalized
energy is ζ = E/β2, where
β2 = 5.603 eV for the 1B transition and
3.470 eV for the ICT transition.

Figure 1 Normalized energies ζi of m-NA.

Wave-Function Coefficients and Transition Moments
As
observed in Figure 2 for m-NA, all the real wavefunction coefficients
for the LUMO are different in the Brillouin zone from 0 to π.
In this case, 0 indicates a very high displacement because of the
high-frequency movement around the benzene ring induced by the ring
currents (right-rotatory or left-rotatory).

Figure 2 Variation of the real
wavefunction coefficients for the LUMO in
the m-NA in the Brillouin zone.

As observed in Figure 3 for m-NA, the high dispersion
of the π-charge
in the HOMO (energy 5) is changed to high charge concentration in
the LUMO (energy 1); this produces a decrement of the linear and NLO
properties, as seen below. This is explained at length in section
S-2.3 of the Supporting Information. Another
feature is that the nonzero coefficients of the LUMO (energy 1) are
the coefficients c4, c6, and c11. This implies that,
for instance, the transition moment Ω51 takes as
reference the carbon C5 in the right-rotatory R1C5 current direction
(see eq 12 in the Computational Methodology section) 1  

Figure 3 Charge distribution normalized by ci2 for the (a) HOMO (energy
5) and (b)
LUMO (energy 1) for m-NA.

Then, the change of the charge distribution in
the group NO2 (c4), the carbon
C6 (c6), and the group NH2 (c11) in an electronic transition from the HOMO
to the LUMO
is crucial for determining the linear and NLO properties. In particular,
the change of the charge distribution in NO2, i.e., the
change of the value of the coefficient c4 from the HOMO to the LUMO is the highest. Then, the change of electronic
distribution of the group NO2 represents the most important
contribution to the linear and NLO properties.

As seen in Figure 4, the real and imaginary
parts of the interband transition moments
from the carbon 5 of m-NA between the HOMO (energy
5) and LUMO (energy 1) are higher in the left-rotatory current L1C5
than for the right-rotatory current R1C5. On the other hand, the corresponding
difference of the imaginary parts of the intraband transition moments
of these currents are similar as seen in Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information. As seen below, the higher
shift of the interband transition moment in the left-rotatory current
produces a stronger increment of the intraband χ(3) values as observed from eqs 19 and 20 (found in the Computational Methodology section).

Linear Optical Properties
We obtained the linear susceptibility
χ(1), the molecular polarizability αP, and the dielectric constant for the solution of m-NA with acetonitrile at Wp = 0.0648,
which are plotted, respectively, in Figures S-3, S-5, and S-6 of the Supporting Information. We also determined experimentally
the molar absorptivity ε of m-NA in acetonitrile
for the 1B (11 981 L mol–1 cm–1) and ICT transitions (1192 L mol–1 cm–1). We have simulated these values as seen
in Figure S-4. It was necessary to iterate
the value of Γ (damping of the optical transition) in order
to obtain the correct values of ε. Then, it was possible to
determine the value of the relaxation time τR (computed from the phononic factor, η)
of these transitions, normalizing with the experimental UV spectra
as in ref (6). Thus,
the values of η were 0.011 (231 nm) and 0.0105 (373 nm). The
relaxation times of m-NA, o-NA,
and p-NA are reported in the Supporting Information.

We also simulated the dielectric
constant of crystalline m-NA, which is given in Figure S-9. It was necessary to apply the degeneracy
factors obtained by the Fermi’s golden rule, as explained above.
We have also simulated the refraction index for five experimental
data as seen in Table S-1 and Figure S-10 and the error was less than 3% and
we consider that this result supports the hypothesis of weighing by
the normalized oscillator strengths of the 1B and ICT electronic
transitions for χ(1), βz, and χ(3). On the other hand, we analyzed
the shift of the derivative of the linear susceptibility χ(1) in the Brillouin zone as was done in ref (6). We found that both the
real and imaginary parts of χ(1) for the 1B transition change in a constant way throughout the Brillouin zone
as seen in Figure 5 for the left-rotatory current L1C5. This behavior is observed although
the real and imaginary parts of the transition moment Ω15 were not constant in the Brillouin zone as observed in Figure 4b, because |Ω15| was constant. Then, the evaluation of χ(1) through eq 13, at
λLaser = 231 nm (where the 1B transition
happens), with both |Ω15| and band gap constant (see Figure 1), implies that χ(1) changes in a constant way throughout the Brillouin zone
for the 1B electronic transition. However, the linear susceptibility
changes with the wavelength as seen in Figure S-3 of the Supporting Information.

of χ(1) in the Brillouin
zone for the ring current L1C5 at λLaser = 231 nm
(1B transition).

NLO Properties
The overall NLO properties of the m-NA are reported in Table 1 for the transparent region and for λLaser = 1064 nm. The values of χ(3) for the transitions
from the six carbons of benzene where the unit cell begins are tabulated
for the right-rotatory and left-rotatory directions.

a The experimental value of m-NA at 1064 nm is 1.81 × 10–13 esu.24

In Table 1, it is
found that the generation of the NLO properties is more distributed
in the reference carbons C6 (65%) and C7 (34%) in the right-rotatory
current and in the carbons C5 (64%) and C6 (26%) in the left-rotatory
current. The change of importance of the carbon C7 in the right-rotatory
current to C5 in the left-rotatory current implies that the direction
of the current modifies the importance of the reference carbon in
the generation of the χ(3) NLO properties. Indeed,
as it was predicted by the behavior of the transition moments from
the carbon C5 above, χ(3) is higher in the left-rotatory
current. In the same context, from the different constants in the
transition moment for the left-rotatory current in eq 1, constant 7 for the linear multiplication
of the wavefunction coefficient c4 (i.e., c45*c41) was higher. Then, the influence
of the transition moment from the NO2 entity is higher
in the overall transition moment and consequently in the NLO properties.
This was also predicted above by the change of charge distribution
in Figure 3.

It is also seen from Table 1 that the real parts of χ(3) for almost all
the reference carbons in m-NA have negative signs,
indicating a defocusing behavior.23 We
believe that this is due to the higher effect of the band structure
through the lattice vibrations. The experimental value of χ(3) for m-NA is 1.81 × 10–13 esu in a solution at Wp = 0.05 of acetone
by the method of EFISH (Electric-Field-Induced Second Harmonic Generation)
with a laser of λLaser = 1064 nm.24 The calculated value in this work, taking into account
the average of the right-rotatory and left-rotatory currents, is 2.87
× 10–13 esu (158% of the experimental value)
in a solution at Wp = 0.0648 in acetonitrile.
As supplementary data, the values for the corresponding molecular
second hyperpolarizability γ are 1.75 × 10–40 esu at ωLaser = 0 s–1, and 1.89
× 10–35 esu at λLaser = 1064
nm. These values were obtained by considering a constant dielectric
constant of 35.96 for the wavelengths near ωLaser ≈ 0 s–1 and 1.81 for the wavelengths near
λLaser = 1064 nm, respectively,25−27 and γAcetonitrile = 0.09 × 10–35 esu28 (see Supporting Information section S-6 for the considerations to evaluate γ). The experimental
value of the second hyperpolarizability γ for the same conditions
is 1.2 × 10–35 esu in dc-SHG at λLaser = 1064 nm, with a 50–75% uncertainty.24 In this way, the deviation from the theoretical
value (58%) is not so high.

We have also evaluated the shift
of χ(3) in the
Brillouin zone and found that its real part also remains constant
as seen in Figure 6 for the current L1C5 (the imaginary part is negligible as seen in Table 1). Indeed, the terms
s1 and s2 of the interband contribution, and
s3 and s4 of the intraband contribution (see eqs 19 through 20 in the Computational Methodology section) remain constant. As observed in Figure 6, the absolute values of the intraband terms
s3 and s4 are greater than the absolute values
of the interband terms s1 and s2. The absolute
value of the term s2 has a similar order of magnitude as
s3 and s4 because of the higher values of both
Ω11 and Ω55 as seen in Figure S-11
of the Supporting Information and eq 19. A larger difference
of the intraband moments Ω11 and Ω55 produces a higher increment of χ(3) in the Brillouin
zone. On the contrary, polyenes and polyenynes have equal intraband
transitions moments6 and then the terms
s2 (interband) and s4 (intraband) do not contribute
to the generation of the NLO properties in those compounds.

Figure 6 Variation of
the interband terms (s1, s2)
and intraband terms (s3, s4) of χ(3) for m-NA (see eqs 19 and 20 in the Computational Methodology section) in the Brillouin
zone for an incident laser ωLaser ≈ 0 s–1.

We have also found that in the evaluation of χ(3), the interband and intraband contributions can be additive
or have
an opposite sign. As observed in Table 1, the interband contribution has an opposite sign with
respect to the intraband contribution to χ(3) in
the reference carbon C5 in the right-rotatory direction
and for this reason the interband value of |χ(3)|
is 1591 times higher than the total value of χ(3). As seen in Table 1, the average interband contribution of χ(3) is
higher than the total value of χ(3) by a factor of
268 in the right-rotatory direction and 39 in the left-rotatory direction.
Then, the overall effect of the intraband contribution is to decrease
the NLO properties in m-NA as also found by Dadsetani
and Omidi.20 We consider that the annihilations
are due to the interaction 1–3 of the carbons joined to the
NO2 and NH2 groups. Then, the main annihilation
is from carbon C5 to carbon C7 (interband factor 1591 to the total)
in the right rotatory current and from carbon C7 to carbon C5 in the
left rotatory current (interband factor 84 to the total), see Table 1. Thus, a higher annihilation
is produced when the transition moment takes as reference carbon C5.
On the other hand, for the eight permutations of the laser wavelength
in the third harmonic generation (THG) experiment at 1064 nm, the
contribution in the NLO properties is:29 (1)+ω, +ω, +ω (0%); (2) +ω, +ω, −ω
(1%); (3) +ω, −ω, +ω (1%); (4) (SH) +ω,
−ω, −ω (8%); (5) −ω, +ω,
+ω (0%); (6) (FH) −ω, +ω, −ω
(3%); (7) −ω, −ω, +ω (1%); (8) (THG)
−ω, −ω, −ω (85%) for the right-rotatory
ring currents. It is observed in this list that the THG is the most
important. As expected, the SHG and the first harmonic (FH) follow
in importance.

In addition, we have simulated the χ(3) NLO properties
of o-NA and p-NA by this methodology,
and the values are 11 and 34% of the experimental ones: 7.45 ×
10–14 esu for o-NA and 2.91 ×
10–13 esu for p-NA. The simulated
value of m-NA, 2.87 × 10–13 esu, is similar to the value of p-NA and almost
four times higher than that of o-NA. We consider
that both the resonance structures in the aromatic compound and the
correlated electronic resonance of NH2 and NO2 to produce a zwitterionic compound induce an increment of the electronic
correlations through the exchange integral K. The
resulting effect increases the NLO properties of o-NA and p-NA.

In addition, we have evaluated
the SHG coefficient βz using this
methodology through eq 13 with the value of μee = 5.6 D obtained by this
work. βz is 0.97 × 10–30 esu at ωLaser = 0 s–1 (1.69 ×
10–30 esu at λLaser = 1064 nm),
15% (27%) of the experimental
value,24 considering the B convention.30 Theoretical calculations using Gaussian 98 with
a 3-21 G (p,d) basis set based on the finite field approach give a
value of 0.67 × 10–30 esu (11% of the experimental
one changing the value to the B convention)30−33 at ωLaser =
0 s–1. We consider that the lower value is due to
the gas phase evaluation in the Gaussian methodology instead of an
evaluation in the condensed phase,30 which
is done in this work. In this way, our methodology gives a better
approximation than that of Willetts et al.30 Indeed, other experimental evaluations of βz for m-NA in solution are missing from the
literature, as it happens in crystalline state evaluation of χz(2), in order to have more certainty
in the evaluation of βz. Thus, the
theoretical value in this work for the corresponding χz(2) (in correspondence to βz) in crystalline state (see Supporting Information section S-5) is 4.14 × 10–8 esu at λLaser = 1064 nm. If we consider
the effective experimental value of χz(2)34 or the experimental
Lorentz approximation of βz,24 the last value is either 84 or 10%, respectively.
Besides, the values of Carenco et al. of χz(2)35 normalized by Huang
et al.34 give a higher value (153%). Thus,
the macroscopic value of χz(2) in the crystalline state found in this work is more accurate
than the parameter βz. On the other
hand, if we consider the experimental value μee36 of 11.6 D, the value of βz is
5.26 × 10–30 at ωLaser = 0
s–1 (9.14 × 10–30 at λLaser = 1064 nm), 84% (145%) of the experimental one. This
corroborates that the experimental value of μee is
more exact. Thus, there is a higher charge separation in the functional
groups NH2 and NO2 in the LUMO than that predicted
by Hückel–Agrawal’s approximation. This higher
charge separation in NH2 and NO2 produces an
increment of the excited dipole moment μee and, consequently,
in the SHG coefficient βz(−2ω;ω,ω).
On the other hand, in the evaluation of χ(3), the
charge separation in the molecular groups NH2 and NO2 is not important and then the values obtained by Hückel–Agrawal’s
approximation are near the experimental ones, as seen above.

Conclusions
Through the analysis of Hückel–Agrawal’s
model,
we can evaluate the NLO properties and understand the causes behind
the generation of the NLO properties through left- and right-rotatory
currents circulating in the bonds of the benzene ring. In this way,
the transitions from the carbon between the carbons bonded to NO2 and NH2 are more important for the generation
of the NLO properties. In addition, the steadiness of the optical
properties in m-NA with no resonances in the Brillouin
zone does not allow a strong increment of the optical properties by
changing the frequency of the laser beam. On the other hand, the border
effects in m-NA have almost no importance in the
evaluation of the optical properties of this compound. In this way,
the macroscopic and molecular linear and NLO properties can be predicted
with reasonable accuracy by this methodology.

Experimental Section
Materials and Steady-State Measurements
All compounds
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-Nitroaniline (para-nitroaniline, p-NA, 99%), 3-nitroaniline (meta-nitroaniline, m-NA, 98%), and 2-nitroaniline
(ortho-nitroaniline, o-NA, 98%)
were used as received. Acetonitrile (HPLC-plus, >99.9%) was used
as
the solvent for preparing the stock solution (8.6 × 10–4 M). Electronic absorption spectra for NAs were recorded in a UV
1800 (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer, in a 10 mm path length quartz cell.
The aliquots (5 μL) were taken from the stock solution for several
solutions with concentrations ranging from 2.0 × 10–5 to 1.9 × 10–6 M. Experimental values of the
molar absorptivity ε were determined from these dilute solutions.

Computational Methodology
The values of the linear
and NLO properties were obtained by solving the secular equation of
Hückel–Agrawal’s method (see the Supporting Information) and then using their
corresponding equations by the software Mathematica for the evaluation
of the linear and nonlinear properties. The calculations for m-NA were done on a personal computer and the calculations
for o-NA and p-NA were done on the
supercomputer cluster Yoltla. In the following, we show the concepts
and calculations made to determine the optical properties of the NAs.

Resonance Energy β
In Hückel–Agrawal’s
approximation, the following parameters are important for the evaluation
of the energies and wavefunction coefficients: (1) the resonance energy
of the different bonds βj and (2)
the degree of conjugation in relation to the double bond vj = βj/βdouble bond = βj/β2. In a previous paper, the values of β2 are higher than the values reported by ab initio calculations.2,37,38 We consider that β2, which is named β2C, includes correlation
energies (U + V). In this way, for
polyenes without considering electronic correlation effects4,5 2a  where v = β1/β2

For polyenes with electronic correlations 2b  

In the evaluation of the absorption
maxima of m-NA, we have analyzed the effect of the
three bands of the aromatic
ring. In principle, we have considered that the energy ratio of the
maxima for the three bands with respect to 1B band indicates
the degree of conjugation of the benzene aromatic ring for the three
transitions. Thus far, we have assumed that the degree of conjugation
for aromatic benzene in relation to the fixed double bond of benzene
for the 1B band is vpp = βII/β2 = 177/203.5 = 0.8698, for the 1La band vpp = βII/βII = 203.5/203.5 = 1.0, and for the 1Lb is vpp = βII/β = 260/203.5 = 1.2776. On the other hand, we have
hypothesized that the ICT band in m-NA has an influence
on the NLO properties given by the proportion of its oscillator strength fi in relation to that of the 1B band. The influence of the ICT transition is due to the
resonance structures associated to the charge transfer from the donor
NH2 to the acceptor NO2. Besides, for simplicity
in the evaluation, we have taken the groups NO2 and NH2 as molecular entities to avoid the complex zwitterionic structures
as seen in Schemes S-1 and S-2 of the Supporting Information, which can produce a complex analysis of the optical
properties. Indeed, the bond length of the atom N in the group NO2 with the adjacent carbon is higher than a single bond in
NAs (common single bond length C–N = 1.395 Å, common double
bond length in C–N = 1.355 Å, bond length of C–NO2 in m-NA = 1.4666 Å).39,40 Thus, the ICT effect does not change the characteristic of the single
bond in C–NO2 to a double bond to form 4 π-pair
bonds and then we can consider that the HOMO is the upper π-pair
orbital of 3 π-pair orbitals of occupied electrons.

Evaluation of the Resonance Energies β
We have
evaluated the resonance energies β for m-NA
with a procedure similar to that featured in ref (6). In this case, the values
of the conjugation degrees for NAs were obtained by their linear interpolation
in relation to the single (s) and double (d) bond lengths (li) for
β-carotene, (ls = 1.4496 Å with v = 0.7188;
ld = 1.3502, vd = 1.0000, respectively).6 The data of the bond lengths for NO2 and NH2 joined to benzene were obtained from ref (40). Thus, the values of the
ratios of resonance energy of the bond in m-NA are
given by v4 = 0.6710, vpp = 0.8698, vr = 0.8844,
related to the bonds to NO2, carbons in the aromatic ring,
and NH2, respectively. Besides, we have experimentally
evaluated the band maxima for the 1B transition and for
the ICT transition in m-NA in acetonitrile in the
same concentration as in acetone, in which the NLO properties were
evaluated. The band maxima and the resonance energies β2C were 1B (λ = 231 nm, β2C = 5.603 eV), ICT (λ = 373 nm, β2C = 3.470
eV). We normalized the oscillator strengths fi reported by Bendazolli et al.41 for 1B and La and their values were
0.60 and 0.40, respectively. These normalized oscillator strengths fi were used as factors for
calculating the contribution of the 1B and La bands to
the linear and NLO properties, except for the evaluation of the molar
absorptivity ε, where the experimental ratio of absorbance was
used.

Secular Equations and Wavefunction Coefficients of NAs
The secular equations and the equations of the wavefunction coefficients
for m-NA are given in the Supporting Information section S-2, bearing in mind the notation given
in Scheme 1, where
the ring current in the right-rotatory direction from carbon 5 is
labeled R1C5.

Scheme 1 Numbering of the Atoms of m-NA in
Which NO2 and NH2 Are Taken as Molecular Entities
Levine has explained that as the Hückel
approximation does
not consider the electronic repulsion, the calculated energies are
not the experimental energies,3 but rather
they are ideal energies. Nevertheless, we have related the experimental
absorption band maxima to the evaluation of the resonance energies
β as in ref (6) and then the values of β implied that the gap between energies
β ζΗΟΜΟ and β
ζLUMO in Figure 1 matches the experimental value. It is important to
clarify that this benzene Hückel–Agrawal’s approximation
does not consider (1) the electronic repulsion between electrons in
the on-site bond, (2) the electronic correlations because of the interaction
of the electrons on the near bond, and (3) the border effects in the
Brillouin zone because of the finiteness of the benzene ring.

Evaluation of the Coulombic Electronic Repulsion through the
Wavefunction Coefficients
In addition, we have used the semiempirical
molecular orbital theory of Pople and Beveridge42 for the evaluation of the electronic repulsion, which is
given by the factors which multiply the wavefunction coefficients 3  where 4   5  where Pμν(43) is the mobile bond order which defines
the importance of the electronic repulsion in the bond and is defined
by 6  cμi and cνi are the wavefunction coefficients, where μ,ν are the
indices of the atomic orbitals and i is the index
of the molecular orbitals42 of the NAs.
The values of Pμμ represent
the charge density on atom μ. VAB is the interaction potential of atom B on the electrons of atom A.

γAB is originated from refs (42) and (44) 7  

J is the electronic
coulombic integral and K is the electronic exchange
integral, and μ, ν
also index the atomic orbitals. We obtain γAB with the approximation of μ = ν, that is, taking
the same orbital in atoms A and B. 8  

We have found that for Hückel–Agrawal’s
approximation
for m-NA 9  

The same result was found in o-NA. For p-NA, the only nonzero values
were P67,Re = P76,Re = P910,Re = P109,Re = 0.5 because
the nonzero wavefunction coefficients for the HOMO orbital are c6, c7, c9, and c10. We have found
that, in both o-NA and p-NA the
exchange integral K was important, which enhances
the electronic correlation effect. For this reason, the linear optical
properties for these compounds were simulated, but not the NLO properties,
as seen below.

For neutral atoms, PAA = PBB = 1 and with
the assumption of VAB = ZA γAB,45 then eqs 4 and 5 for m-NA result in 10   11  

Thus, the electronic repulsion terms
are only present in the on-site
energies and the repulsion terms are not important in the bond order
of m-NA. Besides, we have found that Pμμ has constant values in the range [0.78,
1.27] throughout the Brillouin zone (see section S-3 of the Supporting Information). In this way, the effect
of coulombic electronic repulsion J on the bond order Fμνm-NA is negligible
in the Pople approximation, and then the resonance energy βμν only influences the mobile bond order, with
a negligible interaction of the electrons in m-NA.

Transition Moment and Dipole Moment
In the evaluation
of the transition moments by Hückel–Agrawal’s
approximation, we have assumed that the transition moments derived
from the Bloch equations for n = N unit cells can be applied to the unit cell of the benzene molecule
with n = 1, being 3 for one circulation of current
in the benzene ring. In Scheme 1, the carbons are numbered from NO2 (coefficient c4) and the right-rotatory moment transitions
begin from carbon C5 to the following carbons until carbon C10 in
a clockwise (right) direction. The counterclockwise direction in Scheme 1 in the numbering
indicates the transition moment in the left direction. Besides, we
have used the methodology applied in ref (6). With this background, the transition moment
in a right-current which begins from carbon C5 (Scheme 1) of m-NA is from energy
5 (HOMO) to energy 1 (LUMO). In this case, we have considered that
from this carbon C5 begins the unit cell 12  

In addition, the other five carbons
in the benzene ring can also be referenced for the right-rotatory
and left-rotatory transition moments. For this reason, the transition
must be averaged for the six atoms of benzene. However, it was found
that the absorption spectra of the 1B transition generated
from the six atoms (see Scheme 1) were similar and then the resonance energy of the double
bond β2C was almost the same.

In addition,
we have estimated the dipole moment of the ground-state
HOMO μg through the quantum vector method. This method
evaluates the dipole moments of the σ-bonds and the π-bonds
to calculate the total dipole moment.3,46−50 We have hypothesized that the π-charge lies in the oxygens,
and not in the nitrogen as observed in p-NA in the
HOMO frontier orbital of Kaczmarek-Kedziera’s work.51 The configuration of m-NA was
the experimental crystalline configuration.40 Thus, the calculated dipole moment for this compound was 4.2 D with
no charge separation (Q = 0). We have adjusted the
charge in nitrogens and oxygens in the σ-dipole moment and found
that a charge separation of 0.01 produces the required experimental
value of 4.6 as it is expected for a zwitterionic compound.52 However, the excited dipole moment of 5.60 D
differed from the experimental one of 11.6 D reported by electrochromism.36 With a charge separation of 0.11, this experimental
value of the dipole was reproduced. Then, it is expected that the
NLO properties given by the SHG coefficient βzzz be lower than the experimental one as seen in eq 13,53 with
B convention.30 βz = βzzz because the third-order tensor becomes
a zero-rank tensor (a complex number) where the direction of the dipole
moment is considered the main axis. The notation would be β
instead of βz, in accordance with
the polarizability α and the second hyperpolarizability γ
for having a one-dimensional chain; but in the literature, βz is used more often. In the case of the non-centrosymmetric m-NA, we consider the absolute values of the dipole moments.
The approximation of m-NA as a linear chain, with
the ring current going along the bonds of the aromatic ring, implies
that the approximation of absolute values in the transition and dipole
moments be more valid, see below 13  where fe is the
normalized oscillator strength of the absorption band for the excited
state, μgg and μee are the ground
and excited moments, ω is the frequency of the laser beam, ωeg and μeg are the excitation energy and the
transition moment of the 1B and ICT electronic transitions.

We emphasize that eq 13 results from considering a two-level model, where the 1B electronic and ICT transitions take part in a proportion given
by the normalization of the oscillator strengths, see above (the equations
for the evaluation of βz for the
Hückel–Agrawal approximation are given in the Supporting Information section S-5).

Linear Optical Properties
The evaluation of the linear
optical properties is described elsewhere.4,5 Thus,
in section S-4 of the Supporting Information, an analysis of these properties is given. We used the following
equation of the linear susceptibility χ(1) (esu)
in the description of the linear optical properties of m-NA where the degeneracy factors gc and fvc are consistent with the Fermi’s golden
rule (FGR),54 see below. More importantly,
the FGR was used when the material was in crystalline state and not
applied when m-NA was in solution in the evaluation
of the transition moments, linear and NLO properties, because the
band structure increases the dipole moments. 14   15  where ωcv is the frequency
of the band gap and is given by 16   17   18  σ is the perpendicular surface density
of a unit cell (molecule/cm2). V is the
volume of the compound. N is the number of unit cells,
which include the aromatic ring and the substituents and then N = 4.5. The value of σ depends on the physical state
(crystalline, liquid, or solution) and this also influences the value
of χ0(1) (or χ(2) and
χ(3)). We must clarify that the value of σ
also depends on the linear or NLO properties. Then, there is a linear
optical perpendicular surface density σχ(1) and a NLO perpendicular surface density σχ(3) as it was tabulated in ref (6). In this way, the linear
surface density σχ(1) of a solution
of m-NA in acetonitrile at Wp = 0.0648 is 2.8 × 1013 molecules/cm2.

For its part, Γ is the damping in the optical transition55 with Γ = 1/τR (s–1), τR is the
relaxation time of an excited state. With these values we can evaluate
the phononic factor η = ℏ/β2/τRa. We have assigned the
factor 1/2 in eq 14 because
of the resonance phenomena as Ward, for example, has assigned56 because of a Lorentzian behavior. In this work,
in order to calculate the values of χ(1) and χ(3) of the single aromatic compounds, the limits of integration
of the Brillouin zone were cut down from (−π/a, +π/a) to (0, +π/a), that is, the lower limit begins in the unit cell of
benzene constituted by a hypothetic single and double bond and continues
to infinity because of the ring current, as commented above. With
this assumption, we have not considered the border interactions at
the end of the unit cell, which diminish the NLO properties because
of correlation effects (increment of the electronic interactions).
Besides, ζ is a dimensionless variable which needs to be iterated
to cover the UV wavelength range.

Because we have considered
that m-NA is a linear
chain, the second-rank tensor χxx,interband(1) becomes
a zero-rank tensor χxx,interband(1) = χ(1) which is a complex number. The same applies for the molecular polarizability
α, which is evaluated as a function of wavelength in the Supporting Information section S-4.2 considering
the electronic transition 1B and the ICT electronic transition.

Remarkably, the influence of the dielectric constant of the solvent
in the solution over χ(1), χ(2),
and χ(3) of m-NA is determined by
the normalized oscillator strength fi and wavelength of the absorption peaks for the 1B and ICT electronic transitions. The same applied to the
polarizability α, first hyperpolarizability β, and second
hyperpolarizability γ.

χ(3) NLO Properties
We have also evaluated
the NLO properties of m-NA with eqs 16–23 with the values of β2C obtained by fitting the
experimental absorption maxima.

For the evaluation of χ(3) (esu) at ωLaser = 0 s–1 (transparent region) the following expressions were used4 19   20   21  where 22   23  

The number of unit cells N is in this case three
for the benzene ring in eq 18, because the NLO properties depend mainly on the currents
circulating around the aromatic ring. a is the length
of the unit cell (cm) associated to the static single and double bonds
of benzene. On the other hand, the prefactor χ0(3) changes to χ0(3) = 8e4σa3/π/β23 when eq 16 and the expression Ωijea are used. As explained above, the FGR is applied to the crystalline
state because of the band electronic structure, which increases the
dipole moments, then gc and gv can differ from 1 in eqs 19 and 20. Besides, the effect
of the dielectric constant of the solvent in the solution is taken
into account via the intensity and energy of the peaks of the UV absorption
spectrum in the solvent, as explained above. On the other hand, we
have taken into account that σχ(3) for m-NA is 1.99 × 1014 molecules/cm2 in the solution (typically, in NLO-determinations are used
concentrated solutions) as it was calculated in β-carotene,6 which is associated to a single and double bond
in a linear chain. This differs from the value for the solid crystalline
state which is 5.69 × 1014 molecules/cm2, considering a density of m-NA of 1.3003 g/cm3.40b Importantly,
the interaction of the laser beam is with the m-NA
molecule as a linear ring in which the electronic ring current runs.
Indeed, the high dipole moment present in the m-NA
implies that the solvent molecules, in this case acetone,24 surround the m-NA molecule
and diminish its surface density σχ(3). Thus, the value of σχ(3) for m-NA lies between the values of the PTS polyenyne
(low σχ(3) = 1.36 × 10 14 molecules/cm2) and the polyacetylene polymer (high σχ(3) = 3.2 × 10 14 molecules/cm2).6

The degeneracy factors gc and gv and number
of transition moments fvc and fcv for the LUMO and
HOMO in eqs 19 and 20 were determined following the FGR54 24  

Wvc is
the rate transition from the
HOMO to the LUMO, a is the length of a bond, fcv is the number of transition moments from
the HOMO to the LUMO, and gc is the degeneracy
of the LUMO level.

The final equations were obtained from a
dimensional analysis of
the FGR in relation to the cofactor χ0(3) in eq 22 and to the variable Sij in eq 23. We have also taken into account the polarization with its
respective susceptibilities, which give eqs 14 and 15 from Genkin
and Mednis’ analysis.57 Thus, a
higher transition moment (square)58 and
higher degeneracy of the energy levels increase the polarization through
the increment of the susceptibilities, proportional to the square
of the transition moment as expressed by the FGR.

For ω
≠ 0, in accordance to Agrawal and Flitzanis,4 and again taking into account the energy degeneracy54,57,58 25   26  

“P”
indicates the total permutations
which are eight for a one-dimensional chain and result from the permutations
of ω1, ω2, and ω3 between the values +ω and −ω (2 × 2 ×
2). Besides, because we have considered that m-NA
is a linear chain, the fourth rank tensor χxxxx(3) becomes
a zero-rank tensor, χxxxx(3) = χ(3), which
is a complex number.

Crucially, it was realized that the simulation
of the linear and
NLO properties of m-NA, o-NA, and p-NA in solution has more physicochemical coherence without
the application of the Fermi’s golden rule and then gc and fvc are both
equal to 1. In this way, both m-NA and p-NA have similar NLO properties and the fourth part corresponds to
that of o-NA.

a In a previous article, we have used
the relation η = ℏ/β2/τR/2; then, the values in this work correspond to the common notation
in the literature.

b In a previous
article,6 we had the same situation with
the films of the semiamorphous
polyenyne PHDAz, which was obtained experimentally and the value of
the absorption coefficient α (cm–1) allowed
to determine the value of σχ(1) =
1.2 × 1012 molecules/cm2. The semiamorphous
film of this polyenine had crystalline regions and can be compared
to a solution, because the amorphous regions can be considered as
the solvent and the crystalline regions as the active sites. In this
way, in the evaluation of χ(3)for PHDAz by Hückel–Agrawal’s
methodology, it was necessary to take into account a value of σχ(3) of 1.36 × 1014 molecules/cm2, a value corresponding to the crystalline parts of the polyenine
PHDAz.
