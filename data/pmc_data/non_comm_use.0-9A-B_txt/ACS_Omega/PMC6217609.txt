Carbocations
are pervasive in contemporary organic synthesis, so
new and innocuous methods of making them are always desirable. A theoretical
approach revealed that compounds in which radical generation takes
place may release carbocations advantageously. The radical types and
molecular substructures that promote this effect were identified.
The best substructures were found to be 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds,
particularly those based on the Meldrum’s acid theme. Sulfate
esters and dithiane rings could also be employed. Radicals generated
on oxygen atoms or ethyne units were particularly effective. For these
species, carbocation release could be reflex, that is, concurrent
with radical generation. Only small radical enhancements were observed
for release of lithium cations because of the ionic character of most
of the precursors. Ethyne units could be incorporated as spacers between
the radical center and the site of carbocation generation. Moreover,
the enhancement was transmitted down polyethyne chains of at least
six units.

Introduction
In a 1974 review, Hayon
and Simic drew attention to the greater
propensity of certain free radicals to deprotonate compared with parent
compounds.1 Theoretical studies have since
confirmed the reality of this enhanced acidity phenomenon.2,3 The importance of the effect as a key step in processes such as
base-promoted homolytic aromatic substitution reactions4−6 and certain one-electron redox transformations of Coenzyme A esters7−9 has also been pointed out.

Recently, my group demonstrated
that suitably sited radical centers
enhanced the acidity not only of carboxylic acids but also of sulfinic
and sulfonic acids. The acidity of other proton donor molecules, particularly
1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, could also be formidably increased by similar
means.10 The label “RED-shift”
(for radical enhanced dissociation) was coined as a short and handy
acronym to refer to the phenomenon. Radicals centered on C-, N-, and
O-atoms induced RED-shifts, provided they were sufficiently close to the acid group and
appropriately oriented. Huge enhancements were induced by alkoxyl
radical centers and by ethynyl radical units such that 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds connected to them became carbon-based superacids.11 Microhydration studies had revealed that acids
with negative pKas, that is, pKas in the range of mineral acids, spontaneously
dissociated on association with only a few (four or five) water molecules.12 The authenticity of the computed RED-shifts
of bicarbonate,13 carboxyl, carboxyethynyl,
and hydroperoxyl radicals was substantiated by computations of their
microhydration behavior.14

The large
magnitudes of many of the deprotonation enhancements
suggested the intriguing possibility that radical centers might also
induce dissociation of neutral species with release of a carbocation
instead of a proton.

The process is generalized in Scheme 1 where the model
compound 1 consists
of a potential radical center X attached to a substructure A, capable
of supporting a negative (−ve) charge, connected with a potential
carbocation +CR3. The corresponding radical 4 is then an intermediate for which heterolytic dissociation
to the carbocation and radical anion could be significantly enhanced.
A sufficiently large enhancement might lead to spontaneous release
of the cation at the moment of radical generation. Carbocation generation
for Friedel–Crafts and other preparative processes usually
requires the use of strong and corrosive Lewis or Brønsted acids.
A likely advantage of this radical-stimulated approach would be that
carbocations could be generated by the “soft” initiation
methods usually applied for radicals, that is, heat, photoredox catalysis,
or UV–vis irradiation.

Scheme 1 Radical-Stimulated Carbocation Generation
Computational methods were
employed to examine the basic premise
of Scheme 1 applied
to different X–A structures and with a variety of cation types.
It was found that significant enhancements were indeed predicted for
release of thermodynamically stabilized cations. This paper describes
a method of assessing the magnitude of the effect and an investigation
of what structural features in the precursors are needed for the phenomenon
to occur.

Results and Discussion
Quantification of Enhancement of Cation Production
from Radical
Precursors
Most radical intermediates are short-lived, so
experimental methods for determination of the dynamics of their heterolytic
cation generation would inevitably be problematic. A theoretical approach
was therefore used to map the outlines of the structural and energetic
constraints on the process. A computational method that would be applicable
to free radicals and would be easy to apply was sought.

A previous
study of 12 radical reaction types compared results from the high-level
composite ab initio G4 method,15 with those
obtained with 23 different density functional theory (DFT) functionals
(plus the MP2 ab initio method).13 The
CAM-B3LYP functional16 was found to perform
best with radical species and gave lowest mean absolute deviations
(MADs). A second benchmarking study was carried out, this time including
second row elements, specifically sulfur.17 Free energies were obtained for 9 diverse radical reactions with
31 different DFT functionals and compared with both G4 and the extrapolated
complete basis limit of a series of CCSD(T)18−20 calculations.
Comparisons of the MADs from both high-level methods indicated that
M05,21 PBE0 (PBE1PBE),22 and LC-ωPBE23 were the
most accurate and that CAM-B3LYP also gave very satisfactory results.
The CAM-B3LYP and the PBE0 functionals were chosen for this study,
and full optimizations were carried out with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis
set. Solvent effects were modeled with radii and non-electrostatic
terms from Truhlar and co-workers’ solvent model density (SMD)
solvation model and/or with the conductor-like polarizable continuum
model (CPCM) model.24

The ease with
which neutral radical 4 ionizes to carbocation 3 will certainly depend on the stabilization of the accompanying
radical anion 5. The free energies for +CR3 production from a radical (4) (ΔG°R) and from the corresponding model (1) (ΔG°M) in which
the unpaired electron (upe) had been replaced by an H-atom were computed
for sets of representative molecules. The difference in these quantities,
ΔΔG°, afforded a useful measure
of the enhancement 1  Positive ΔΔG°
values indicate radical enhancement of cation release, whereas negative
values would correspond to radical inhibition of cation release.

Search for Suitable Radical Platforms
Heterolytic generation
of +CR3 carbocations from 1 will
release the same radical anion •X–A– (5) as that when an acid radical •X–A–H deprotonates. As a starting point, therefore,
X–A units that had been found to provide large deprotonation
RED-shifts11 were chosen for study. Scheme 2 displays the set
selected to investigate release of the t-butyl-cation.
This included carbonate ester radical 6, propiolate ester
radical 9, sulfonate ester radical 10, peroxyl
radical 11, the 5-methylenyl-Meldrum’s acid 12, 5-oxyl-Meldrum’s acid 13 and 5-ethynyl-Meldrum’s
acid 14 derivatives [5-(tert-butyl)-5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione
derivatives], as well as the 2-ethynyl-1,3-dithiane derivative 15. The computed enthalpies ΔH°R and free energies ΔG°R for Me3C+ release are in Table 1, along with the enhancement
factors ΔΔG°.

Modest
enhancements (3–13 kcal/mol) were calculated for
heterolytic generation of Me3C+ from carbonate
radical 6, propiolate radical 9, hydrogen
sulfate radical 10, peroxyl radical 11,
and 5-methylenyl-Meldrum’s acid 12. However, four
of these ionizations were endenthalpic and endergonic and so would
not be practicable under mild conditions. t-Butyl
cation release from the 2-ethynyl-1,3-dithiane radical 15 showed a very large enhancement (47.8 kcal/mol) relative to the
model, but again the process was too energetically uphill for it to
occur spontaneously.

On the other hand, the releases of Me3C+ by
the 5-oxyl-Meldrum’s radical 13 and by 5-ethynyl-Meldrum’s
radical 14 were strongly exergonic, and large enhancements
(38.0 and 33.4 kcal/mol) were predicted. The Meldrum platform appeared
to be the most promising as a core structure for radical-to-cation
transformations. In accord with expectation, these results also indicated
that significant thermodynamic stabilization of the released carbocation
would be needed for spontaneous release.

Investigation of Carbocation
Suitability
In view of
the favorable results obtained for Me3C+ release,
Meldrum’s linked radicals were chosen as platforms to study
release of a range of cations with differing thermodynamic stabilizations.
The computed energies and enhancement factors for release of some
primary, allyl, benzyl, and tertiary carbocations by 5-oxyl-Meldrum’s 16 (process H1) and 5-ethynyl-Meldrum’s 17 (process H2) are listed in Table 2. Interestingly, the table demonstrates that the radical
center enhances cation release in every case. No examples of radical
inhibition of cation release were discovered.

b Dissociated straight to 13– and Me2(MeO)C+.

Although allyl and benzyl cation releases (entries
4 and 6) were
strongly enhanced by the radical center, both were endergonic and
so experimentally impracticable. Introduction of the electron-donating
MeO group led to exergonic processes for release of the primary methoxymethyl
cation (both radical platforms; entries 2 and 3). Similarly, release
of the 1-methoxyallyl and 4-methoxybenzyl cations (entries 5 and 8)
was also exergonic. As might be expected, introduction of the MeO
group to the t-butyl cation led to very favorable
energetics (entries 9 and 10). The optimization for structure 16 (CR3 = Me2(MeO)C+) led
directly to the dissociation products radical anion 13– and carbocation Me2(MeO)C+. This implied that generation of radical 16 (CR3 = Me2(MeO)C+) [and probably 17 (CR3 = Me2(MeO)C+) as well] would
lead to concerted (spontaneous) carbocation formation.

Effect of Solvent
on Carbocation Release
The difference
in solvation between the neutral radical precursors and the charged
products was expected to have a considerable impact on the heterolytic
cleavage. The magnitude of solvation effects was probed for two representative
processes. First, release of the primary MeOCH2+ cation from the carbonate radical precursor 18 (process
H3 in Table 3) (together
with the corresponding model) was examined. Second, the release of
the t-butyl cation from the 5-oxyl-Meldrum’s
radical 13 (and model) (process H4 in Table 3) was studied. The SMD method,
on the basis of the quantum mechanical charge density of a solute
molecule interacting with a continuum description of the solvent,
was employed.24 The free energies for the
two processes, for solvents ranging from water to n-heptane, as well as the enhancement factors relative to the nonradical
models, are recorded in Table 3.

c Extension of the bond length in
Å (radical—model) from Me3C to the C atom of
attachment in Meldrum’s unit.

The free energy for MeOCH2+ release
from
radical 18 increased by nearly 70 kcal/mol (less favorable)
as the polarity of the solvent decreased from water to n-heptane. No solvent was found in which this process would be exergonic.
However, although the free energy of Me3C+ release
from radical 13 increased by about 60 kcal/mol through
the series of solvents, the reaction was favorably exergonic in methanol,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetonitrile, as well as in water.
The enhancement factors ΔΔG° for
both processes H3 and H4 were positive and very substantial for H4.
Interestingly, these enhancements changed by only a small amount as
the solvent was varied. Not unexpectedly therefore, the change in
solvation on going from the neutral model with charged products to
the neutral radical with charged products remained fairly constant,
irrespective of solvent properties. Water was unquestionably the solvent
of choice for advantageous energetics. However, methanol or acetonitrile
could be used, with little or no diminution in enhancement, for covalent
precursors insoluble in water.

The enhancement of ionic dissociation
of the 5-oxyl-Meldrum’s
radical (13) was accompanied by a lengthening of the
bond from its CMe3 group to its Meldrum’s unit compared
to that in the nonradical model (13H). Furthermore, there
was a trend toward greater bond extension [Δr(CC) in Table 3] as
the exergonicity increased for the more polar solvents (see Table 3). For the carbonate
series (18) the C–O bond from the MeOCH2 group to the carbonate unit was also longer in the radical than
in the model but the extension, 0.011–0.015 Å, depending
on solvent, was much smaller.

Release of Acylium and
Lithium Cations
Radical enhancement
of release of acylium and benzoylium cations was also studied for
the set of precursor radicals (and corresponding models) shown in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Radical Platforms
for Release of Acyl Type Cations
The computed enthalpies, free energies, and enhancement
factors
are in Table 4. The
1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one unit of 19a was chosen because of the potential resonance stabilization of the
anions produced on ionization. A modest enhancement of acylium release
from radical 19a was obtained, but the process was impractically
endergonic (Table 4). Similarly, although the releases of both PhCO+ and
MeCO+ were significantly enhanced for the ethynyl platforms 21a,b, the energetics were again very unfavorable.
However, acylium release was exergonic from both 5-oxyl-Meldrum’s 22a and 5-ethynyl-Meldrum’s 23a precursors
and large enhancement factors were observed for the radicals. Release
of PhCO+ was also favorable for both 22b and 23b.

Because of the importance of lithium ions in battery technology,
release of this alkali metal cation from carbonate 24, carboxyethynyl 25, ethynyl 26, and Meldrum’s
radical-containing platforms was also examined (Scheme 4). The computed energies are in Table 5. For all of these
platforms, the heterolyses were endergonic. The smallness of the enhancement
factors obtained for Li+ release from the radical forms
of the carbonate and carboxyethynyl species (Table 5) can be attributed to their salt-like character.
The calculated long C–Li bond (2.18 Å) in model-lithiated
Meldrum’s acid 27H, together with the large positive
charge on Li (0.88), indicated it was virtually an ionic compound.
The C–Li bond was slightly shorter (2.07 Å) in the radical 27 and the charge on Li was smaller (0.65), suggesting lower
ionic character. In conformity with this, the computed ΔΔG° was actually marginally negative (−3.6).
For the ethynyl-Meldrum’s platform, the minimum energy structure
of the model had the Li-atom attached to one of the O-atoms and in
the optimized radical 28, it was attached to the terminal
ethyne C atom. Not only was the process endergonic but virtually no
enhancement was found (Table 5).

Influence of Ethyne Radicals
and Multiple Ethyne Spacer Units
The cation release process
was tolerant of the introduction of
the two-carbon ethyne spacer between the upe and the cation (see tables
above). The effect of lengthening this spacer by more ethyne units
was therefore studied. Small hydrocarbon cages are known to transmit
spin density across their centers.25,26 The huge γ-H-atom
hyperfine splitting in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum
of the bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl radical pointed to its cage as by far
the most effective.27,28 This spacer unit was also investigated.

Scheme 5 compares
the computed ΔG°M and ΔG°R values and the enhancement factors ΔΔG°, for release of the 2-methoxyprop-2-yl cation from
carbonate radical, with data for the analogs with a bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane
or with an ethyne spacer. Cation release from the carbonate radical
was exergonic and with a modest enhancement (13.5 kcal/mol) compared
with the model. With the ethyne spacer, heterolytic dissociation was
computed to release the 2-methoxyprop-2-yl cation but accompanied
by CO2 and the C2O–• radical anion. The exergonicity was significantly increased, as
was the enhancement factor. On the other hand, with the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane
spacer, ΔΔG° was close to zero such
that enhancement from the upe was completely suppressed.

of Spacers on Release of t-Bu Cations
Computed energies with the PBE1PBE/6-311+G(2d,p)
method and the SMD solvent continuum model with water.

Because the ethyne spacer was so effective, the result
of increasing
the number of ethyne spacer units was also explored. Release of the t-butyl cation from Meldrum’s precursor radicals
with up to 6 ethyne spacers (14n; n = 1–6) and release of the 2-methoxyprop-2-yl cation
from similar precursors with up to 6 ethyne spacers (29n) were examined. Additionally, release of 2-methoxyprop-2-yl
cation from the 1,3-dithiane radicals 15n was studied. Finally, release of lithium ions from the ethynyllithium
precursors 26n, having up to 7 spacers,
was investigated in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The computed free energies
are in Tables 6–9 (see also the Supporting Information).

Release of the t-butyl cation from
Meldrum’s
species 15H-1 and 15-1 was investigated
using both the CAM-B3LYP and PBE1PBE methods (Table 6, top two rows). The respectable agreement
of the energies obtained demonstrates the comparability of the two
methods. The tables show that ΔG°M for all model precursors became less endergonic (or more
exergonic) as the length of the polyethynyl spacer increased. The
dissociations of radicals 14n to Me3C+ became less exergonic as the spacer increased
in length, whereas the dissociation of analogous 29n to Me2(MeO)C+ varied little in exergonicity
(Tables 6 and 7). Loss of the Me2(MeO)C+ cation
from dithiane radical 15n became more
exergonic as the length of the spacer increased (Table 8), but ΔG°M decreased in parallel such that the enhancement
decreased by only a small amount. ΔG°R for loss of Li+ from precursors 26n varied little with spacer length (Table 9).

b r(C–Li)
is length of the bond from the platform A to the leaving Li cation
in the radicals (•XA–Li).

Large enhancement factors ΔΔG°
were computed for dissociation of all Meldrum’s species and
the dithiane precursors to carbocations. Only modest enhancements
were obtained for Li+ release from the polyethynyl precursors 26n. The variation in the ΔΔG° enhancements as the additional spacer units were
added is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Plots of enhancement factors ΔΔG°
(kcal/mol) as a function of the number of C atoms (Cn) in the chains of ethyne spacers for radicals 14n, 29n, 15n, and 26n.

As expected, ΔΔG°
decreased for
the dissociations of all radical species as the length of the polyethyne
spacer chains increased. However, the remarkable result that became
apparent was the ability of the spacer chains to transmit the influence
of the upe through more than 6 or 7 ethyne units (up to 14 C atoms!).
Dissociations to carbocations were still significantly enhanced even
when the upe and breaking bond were (formally) so distant. A similar
ability of polyethynyl spacers to transmit RED-shift was observed
in the analogous deprotonation reactions.11

As mentioned above, the thermodynamic stabilities of the radical
anions •X–A– (5) formed on release of the cations will be a key factor. These same
radical anions are, of course, released in deprotonations of acid
radicals •X–A–H. The distribution
of charge and spin in these species will impact both their solvation
and their thermodynamic stabilization. The previously observed trend
was of larger RED-shifts for radicals with charge delocalized away
from their anionic centers, coupled with spin density distributed
toward these centers.10,11 This same site exchange of spin
with charge, in the released radical anions, undoubtedly also plays
a leading role in cation release.

It might be supposed that
the length of the bond from the platform
A to the leaving cation in the radicals (•XA-cation),
that is, r(C–C) for 14n, 29n, and 15n and r(C–Li) for 26n, would reflect the exergonicity of cation loss. However,
the computed bond lengths for the radicals of Tables 6–9 (final columns)
show only very minor changes and do not correlate well with the ΔG°R values.

Conclusions
The
heterolytic dissociations of neutral covalent species were
greatly enhanced for structures containing radical centers adjacent
to potential cations. Such enhancements took place when the bonds
breaking heterolytically were C–CR3, C–C(O),
O–CR3, N–C(O), O–Li, and C–Li
types. For exergonic heterolytic dissociations, tert-carbocations were required. Electron-releasing groups, particularly
MeO substituents attached to the cationic centers, facilitated the
process. Sulfate ester (10) and dithiane (15) radical platforms promoted exergonic releases of cations. However,
the most successful substructures that gave exergonic heterolytic
release of the widest variety of cations, were the 5-oxyl-Meldrum
and 5-ethynyl-Meldrum radical types (16, 17 etc.). It is very probable that other 1,3-dicarbonyl core structures
would work nearly as well. Spontaneous cation release, concerted with
radical generation, can be anticipated for 3-methoxyallylium and 2-methoxypropylium
cations from these structures. Radical enhancements of Li cation release
were small for all platforms, probably because the precursors were
already salt like or at least partly ionic in character. It was no
surprise that cation release took place most readily in water as solvent,
but methanol, DMSO, and acetonitrile also permitted large enhancements.

In every case of carbocation generation examined, the presence
of an upe either enhanced the process or had little effect. No case
of radical inhibition of carbocation release was found. The only retardation
discovered was for Li+ cation generation from Meldrum-lithium
radical ((2,2-dimethyl-4,6-dioxo-1,3-dioxan-5-yl)lithium, 27), and that was very small.

For large enhancements, the radical
center X and spacer A in the •X–A–CR3 species needed to
be single C, N, or O atoms. Sizeable enhancements were also achieved
for X–A = O–C–O and O–S–O. The
cage bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl structure did not transmit the enhancement,
and it is safe to conclude other saturated hydrocarbon spacers would
also block the effect. A remarkable finding was that the ethyne spacer
in almost every radical platform led to sizeable enhancements. Notably
too, polyethyne spacers gave rise to long-range enhancement. Radicals
generated six or seven ethyne units away from the cationic center
were still effective in enhancing cation release. It is worth mentioning
the complementarity of these fragmentations to those of radical substrates
that see anionic leaving groups, such as acetate anions or the loss
of phosphate anions from deoxyribose radicals.29−31

Carbocations
are extremely important in contemporary organic synthesis32 as well as in cationic polymerizations. Friedel–Crafts
alkylations and acylations are amongst the most important routes to
functionalized aromatic compounds. Wagner–Meerwein skeletal
rearrangements, homoallylic/cyclopropyl rearrangements, pinacol rearrangements,
and others remain important in syntheses of numerous natural products.
Chiral carbocation couplings with nucleophiles constitute valuable
routes to asymmetric syntheses. To date, for most of these processes,
either strong mineral acids or corrosive Lewis acids are required.
Several of the radical platforms described above have the potential
to deliver a specific carbocation as a reflex on generation of the
upe. No strong acids or toxic metals need to be involved, and neutral
conditions will prevail. Excellent control of initiation can be achieved
when the radicals are generated photochemically or by mild heating.
Practical applications of the radical-induced production of carbocations
can therefore be anticipated as mild alternatives for many of these
preparations.

Experimental Section
DFT calculations
were carried out using the Gaussian 09 suite of
programs.33 Results were obtained with
two different DFT methods. First, the CAM-B3LYP functional16 with the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set was employed
with the CPCM continuum model24b with water
as solvent. This model is derived from the COSMO model. Default values
of the keywords Alpha, Radii, TSNUM, and TSARE were employed. On the
basis of previous work with free radicals, the CAM-B3LYP functional,
which combines the hybrid qualities of B3LYP with the long-range correction
proposed by Tawada et al.34 gave the best
results in comparison with G4 (MAD: 2.5 kcal/mol). A second benchmarking
study including second row elements indicated that M05,21 PBE0 (PBE1PBE),22 and LC-PBE23 were the most accurate and
that CAM-B3LYP also gave very satisfactory results. Full optimizations
were carried out with the PBE1PBE/6-311+G(2d,p) method. Solvent effects
were modeled with radii and non-electrostatic terms from Truhlar and
co-workers’ SMD solvation model.24a Vibrational frequency calculations were implemented so that GS (no
imaginary frequencies) and TS status could be checked (one imaginary
frequency), and enthalpies and free energies were adjusted for zero
point and thermal corrections to 1 atm and 298 K. The lowest energy
structures of conformationally flexible molecules were, in most cases,
estimated from related molecules computed previously.10,11 The influence of the six-member ring conformation was shown previously
to be small. In cases of doubt, the same conformation was employed
for the model species as that for the radical species.
