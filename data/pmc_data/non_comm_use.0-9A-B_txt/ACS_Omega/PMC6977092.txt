Accurate prediction of the structures,
stabilities, and electronic
structures of hybrid inorganic/organic systems is an essential prerequisite
for tuning their electronic properties and functions. Herein, the
interface chemistry between the 4-aminothiophenol (4ATP) molecule
and the (001), (101), and (110) surfaces of zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) has been investigated by means of first-principles
density functional theory calculation with a correction for van der
Waals interactions. In particular, the atomic-level insights into
the fundamental aspects of the 4ATP adsorption, including the lowest-energy
adsorption configurations, binding energetics, structural parameters,
and electronic properties are presented and discussed. The 4ATP molecule
is demonstrated to bind most strongly onto the least stable Zn3P2(001) surface (Eads = −1.91 eV) and least strongly onto the most stable Zn3P2(101) surface (Eads = −1.21 eV). Partial density of states analysis shows that
the adsorption of 4ATP on the Zn3P2 surfaces
is characterized by strong hybridization between the molecule’s
sulfur and nitrogen p-orbitals and the d-orbitals of the interacting
surface Zn ions, which gave rise to electron density accumulation
around the centers of the newly formed Zn–S and Zn–N
chemical bonds. The thermodynamic crystal morphology of the nonfunctionalized
and 4ATP-functionalized Zn3P2 nanoparticles
was obtained using Wulff construction based on the calculated surface
energies. The stronger binding of the 4ATP molecule onto the less
stable (001) and (110) surfaces in preference to the most stable (101)
facet resulted in the modulation of the Zn3P2 nanocrystal shape, with the reactive (001) and (110) surfaces becoming
more pronounced in the equilibrium morphology.

1 Introduction
Zinc
phosphide is an attractive earth-abundant solar absorber material
for scalable thin-film photovoltaic applications owing to its direct
band gap of 1.5 eV,1 high visible-light
absorption coefficient (>104 cm–1),2,3 long minority-carrier diffusion length (∼10 μm),4 high extinction coefficient,5 passive grain boundaries,6 and
large range of potential doping concentrations (1013 to
1018 cm–3).7 Despite its ideal optoelectronic properties, problems such as poor
band-alignment with buffer layers, inadequate interface passivation,8,9 and low surface stability in the presence of moisture and oxygen10,11 remain major problems that severely limits the commercial fabrication
of highly efficient Zn3P2-based photovoltaics.
Zinc phosphide nanoparticles can easily get oxidized when in contact
with water and oxygen owing to the higher specific surface area and
higher reactivity relative to the bulk.12−14 It is therefore important
to develop synthesis techniques to protect Zn3P2 surfaces against unwanted oxidation.

Efforts have been made
to passivate Zn3P2 surfaces via in situ functionalization,
wherein the Zn3P2 nanoparticles of thin films
are exposed to a vapor
of organic functional molecules immediately after synthesis.15−18 Functionalization of Zn3P2 nanoparticles can
enhance their surface stability against temperature and possible oxidation
in the presence of oxygen and moisture that could result in their
degradation.19,20 The binding of the organic molecules
to the nanoparticle crystal facets helps to dictate the growth mechanism
in terms of rate, final size, or geometric shape.21 Various functional groups react differently with inorganic
surfaces, with the common example being thiol to gold.15,22 Strongly binding molecules can form a dense protective layer and
hence stabilize the nanoparticles better than weakly binding ones.

A molecular-level insight into the adsorption mechanism of organic
molecules onto inorganic surfaces and nanostructures is a prerequisite
for the development of novel hybrid devices. However, due to the complex
nature of the interface between organic functional groups and semiconductor
nanoparticle surfaces, the interface chemistry is difficult to determine
by purely experimental means. Accurate first-principles density functional
theory (DFT) calculations have, however, become indispensable in complementing
experiments to elucidate the interactions of organic molecules with
solid surfaces.21−24 In this work, first-principles dispersion-corrected DFT-D3 calculations
have been employed to investigate the functionalization of the (001),
(101), and (110) surfaces of Zn3P2 by adsorbed
4-aminothiophenol (4ATP) molecule. Different coupling schemes that
involve one or more functional groups of the 4ATP molecule have been
investigated in order to determine the preferred lowest energy adsorption
configuration. The optimized structures, binding energetics, and electronic
properties of the 4ATP–Zn3P2 complexes
are discussed. Finally, based on calculated surface energies the thermodynamic
crystal morphology of the nonfunctionalized and functionalized Zn3P2 nanoparticle were simulated using Wulff construction.25

2 Computational Details
The first-principles DFT calculations were performed using the
Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.26−28 The projected augmented
wave method29,30 was used to describe the interactions
between the valence and cores electrons. The electronic exchange–correlation
potential was calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional.31−35 In our calculations, the long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions
were taken into consideration using the method of Grimme (DFT-D3).36 This is important because the standard LDA/GGA
approximations fail to provide an accurate description of the asymptotic
decreasing behavior of the long-range vdW interactions that are ubiquitous
in hybrid inorganic/organic systems.37−40 A plane-wave basis set with a
kinetic energy cut-off of 600 eV was tested to be sufficient to converge
the total energy of Zn3P2 to within 10–6 eV and the residual Hellmann–Feynman forces on all relaxed
atoms reached 10–3 eV Å–1. The Brillouin zone of the bulk Zn3P2 was
sampled using 5 × 5 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack41K-point mesh, which ensures
electronic and ionic convergence.

The bulk Zn3P2 was modeled in the tetragonal
system with space group P42/nmc (D4h15) and lattice parameters: a = b = 8.089 Å, c = 11.396
Å (Figure 1a).42−45 The primitive unit cell containing 16 P atoms and 24 Zn atoms. A
full unit cell relaxation yielded strain-free Zn3P2 with lattice parameters a = b = 8.029 Å, c = 11.336 Å, which compares
closely with known experimental data.42−45 To overcome the limitation of
standard DFT methods in accurately predicting the electronic band
gap of semiconducting materials, the screened hybrid DFT functional
with 25% Hartree–Fock exchange46 was employed to determine the electronic structure of Zn3P2 (Figure 1b). The band gap is predicted at 1.51 eV, which is in excellent agreement
with the experiment1 and previous DFT predictions.8,47 The partial density of states (PDOS) plot shows that the valence
band is dominated by the electronic states of the Zn-pd and P-p orbitals,
whereas the conduction band is composed mainly of the Zn-sd orbitals.

functional.

The (001), (101), and (110) surfaces
were considered for the investigation
of the 4ATP molecule adsorption as they are the most commonly observed
growth facets of Zn3P2 nanocrystals.16,48 The surfaces were created from the fully relaxed bulk using the
METADISE code,49 which ensures the creation
of surfaces with zero dipole moment perpendicular to the surface plane.50 However, due to the adsorption of 4ATP on only
one side of the slabs, the Makov–Payne dipole correction51 perpendicular to the surfaces was applied to
correct any net charge or monopole/dipole perpendicular to the surfaces,
which might otherwise affect the adsorption energetics and structures.
The (001) surface has three unique terminations, whereas the (101)
and (110) surfaces have two, unique possible terminations, all of
which were considered and fully relaxed in order to determine the
most stable terminations. For each surface, the slab thickness was
increased until the convergence of the surface energy was achieved
within 1 meV per cell. The converged slab thickness of the (001),
(101), and (110) surfaces is 22.67, 19.65, and 17.02 Å, respectively.
A vacuum region of 20 Å was tested to be large enough to avoid
any spurious interactions between periodic slabs.

The relaxed
structure of the most stable termination of each surface
is schematically shown in Figure 2, whereas the relaxed structures of all possible terminations
of each surface are shown in Supporting Information Figures S1–S3. Shown in Table 1 are the calculated unrelaxed and relaxed surface energies
of all unique terminations of each surface with their corresponding
percentage relaxation. The surface energy of the most stable terminations
of the (001), (101), and (110) surfaces is calculated to be 1.03,
0.60, and 0.95 J m–2, respectively, which suggest
that the surface stability trend in decreasing order is (101) >
(110)
> (001). Each surface is found to under significant relaxation
as
reflected in the calculated percentage relaxation. The significant
percentage relaxation is ascribed to relaxation of topmost undercoordinated
ions, which shift downward to provide a closer to bulk coordination
of the surface species.

The 4ATP
adsorption calculations were carried out on surfaces with
large areas (as shown in Figure 2) in order to minimize lateral interactions between
the 4ATP molecules in neighboring image cells. No symmetry constraints
were imposed on the structural optimization of the 4ATP–Zn3P2 systems, and in particular, the 4ATP molecule
was free to move away laterally and vertically from its initial binding
site or reorient itself to find the lowest-energy adsorption configuration.
The adsorption energy (Eads), which characterizes
the strength of 4ATP–Zn3P2 interactions,
is calculated as follows 1  where E4ATP+surface is the total energy of the relaxed adsorbate-substrate
systems, Esurface is the total energy
of the isolated
surface, and E4ATP is the total energy
of the free 4ATP molecule. An exothermic adsorption process is characterized
by a negative Eads, whereas an endothermic
adsorption process is characterized by a positive value. Prior to
the adsorption of 4ATP on the (001), (101), and (110) Zn3P2 surfaces, the reference energy and bond length were
computed in a cubic box of size 20 Å, sampling only the gamma
point. The fully relaxed structure of the 4ATP molecule is shown in Figure 3a, with the optimized
C–C, C–S, C–N, C–H, S–H, and N–H
bond distances displayed. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of 4ATP (Figure 3b,c) show a dominant
contribution from the 3p orbitals of the sulfur atom, and from the
2p orbitals of N and C atoms. These orbitals are expected to dictate
the reactivity of the 4ATP molecule unto the Zn3P2 surfaces.

LUMO, and (c) the HOMO of 4ATP (C6H7NS). The
amine (−NH2) and thiol (−SH) end groups are
highlighted in dashed circles. (Color scheme: C = grey, S = orange
and H = white).

Atomic-level insight into the
adsorption mechanism of 4ATP at the
Zn3P2 surfaces was analyzed through PDOS and
differential charge density (Δρ) iso-surface contours.
Bader charge analysis was used to quantify any charge transfers between
the 4ATP–Zn3P2 systems.52 The equilibrium morphology of the Zn3P2 nanocrystals were determined using Wulff’s construction based
on calculated surface energies.53 Under
thermodynamic conditions, the equilibrium morphology of a crystal
possesses the minimal total surface free energy for a given volume
based on Gibbs formulation. The relaxed surface energy of the naked
surfaces (γr) was calculated using the equation 2  where Eslabrelaxed is the energy of the
relaxed slab, nEbulk is the energy of
an equal number (n) of the bulk Zn3P2 atoms, and A is the surface area. After
the adsorption of 4ATP on one side of the surface slab (1 × A), the additional energy because of the relaxed surface
at the top of the slab with the adsorbed 4ATP molecule must be separated
from the energy of the fully relaxed naked surface, as the two differ.
From the relaxed surface energy of the naked surface and considering
negligible relaxation at the bottom of the slab (held fixed), it is
possible to calculate the surface energy of the 4ATP-functionalized
surfaces as 3  where Eslab+4ATPrelaxed is the energy of
the surface with adsorbed 4ATP molecule and nE4ATP is the energy of the equivalent number of free 4ATP molecules
in the gas phase. Based on the calculated surface energies, the equilibrium
Wulff morphology for the naked and 4ATP-functionalized surfaces was
constructed using GDIS software.55 Because
of the small difference between the entropies of bulk materials and
the surface, the contribution of the excess entropy term to the surface
free energy is small.56 Hence for solid
surfaces, the surface energy is a close approximation of the surface
free energy which can be assumed to determine the equilibrium morphology
of the nanocrystal. This approach has been employed to investigate
the effect of the adsorption of small molecules on the thermodynamic
morphologies of many different materials, including oxides, carbonates,
phosphates, sulfides, and metal nanoparticles,54,56−59 where good agreement was obtained with the experiment.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Adsorption of 4ATP on the
Zn3P2 (001) Surface
4ATP molecule has
three potential
binding groups; the thiol (−SH), amine (−NH2) end groups, and the benzene (−C6) ring (Figure 3a), thus it may form
single or multiple bonds with Zn3P2 surface
species. In order to determine the preferred adsorption sites and
binding modes of the 4ATP molecule on the (001) surface, a number
of different initial orientations were optimized without any symmetry
constraints. Shown in Figure 4 are the optimized adsorption structures and the calculated
adsorption energies, interatomic bond distances, and charge transfer
are listed in Table 2. Two monodentate configurations, wherein the 4ATP molecule binds
at the Zn site either via the −SH (Zn–S-slanted) or
−NH2 (Zn–N-slanted) end, and a bidentate
configuration, wherein it binds via both the −NH2 and −SH ends (Zn–NS–Zn), were predicted. No
stable chemisorbed structure involving the benzene ring was obtained.
The lowest energy adsorption structure on the (001) surface is predicted
to the monodentate Zn–S-slanted configuration (Figure 4a), which released an adsorption
energy of −1.91 eV, compared to −1.48 eV for the bidentate
Zn–NS–Zn configuration (Figure 4b) and −0.82 eV for the monodentate
Zn–N-slanted configuration (Figure 4c). The interacting Zn–S bond distance
in the most stable Zn–S-slanted configuration is calculated
at 2.458 Å, whereas in the Zn–N-slanted configuration,
the Zn–N bond distance is 2.109 Å. In the bidentate Zn–NS–Zn
configuration, the interacting Zn–S and Zn–N bond distances
are 2.503 and 2.187 Å, respectively. The calculated Zn–S
interatomic distances at the Zn3P2 (001) surface
are similar to those of cysteine metal–S bonds, which are typically
predicted in the range of 2.50–2.520 Å for Au–S
interaction.60,61 Shown in Table 2 are the calculated internal bond distances
of the adsorbed 4ATP molecule on the (001) surface. When compared
to the gas phase geometry parameters, one can observe only small adsorption-induced
changes in the internal bond distances. The adsorbed 4ATP molecule
remained planar with only small tilting in the hydrogen atoms of the
−NH2 end away from the surface. The topology of
the surface also remained essentially preserved with only small lateral
and vertical displacements of the interacting surface species.

3.2 Adsorption of 4ATP on the Zn3P2 (101) Surface
Similar to the (101) surface, a number
of different initial orientations of the 4ATP molecule were optimized
on the (101) surface without any symmetry constraints, in order to
determine the preferred adsorption sites and the lowest-energy adsorption
configurations. Shown in Figure 5 are the three stable adsorption configurations predicted
with the calculated adsorption energies and structural parameters
reported in Table 2. The strongest adsorption is computed for the Zn–S-flat configuration
(Figure 5a) which released
an adsorption energy of −1.21 eV compared to −0.73 eV
for the Zn–S-slant (Figure 5b), and −0.32 eV for the Zn–N-slant (Figure 5c) configurations.
In the lowest energy Zn–S-flat configuration, the interacting
Zn–S bond distance is calculated at 2.482 Å, with the
hydrogen atoms of the −NH2 end tilting toward the
surface such the shorted P···H and Zn···H
interatomic distance are predicted at 2.834 and 2.939 Å, respectively.
In the Zn–S-slant configuration, the Zn–S bond distance
is calculated at 2.553 Å, whereas in the Zn–N-slant configuration,
the Zn–N distance is 2.203 Å. As on the (001) surface,
the adsorbed 4ATP molecule remained planar with only small bending
in the hydrogen atoms of the −NH2 end toward the
surface in the Zn–S-slant configuration and away from the Zn–N-slant
configuration. The surface topology remained essentially unchanged
as reflected in only small vertical displacements (0.04–0.10
Å) of the interacting surface species.

3.3 Adsorption of 4ATP on the Zn3P2 (110) Surface
The predicted lowest energy adsorption
structures of the 4ATP molecule on the Zn3P2 (110) surface are shown in Figure 6 with the energetics and structural details listed
in Table 2. The lowest
energy adsorption structure is predicted to be a bidentate configuration
(Figure 6a), wherein
the 4ATP molecule binds at Zn sites via both the −NH2 and −SH ends (denoted as Zn–NS–Zn). The adsorption
energy is calculated at −1.35 eV, with the interacting Zn–S
and Zn–N bond distances calculated at 2.649 and 2.230 Å,
respectively. The monodentate Zn–S-slant (Figure 6b) and Zn–N-slant (Figure 6c) configurations
released adsorption energies of −0.82 and −0.52 eV,
respectively, and the interacting Zn–S and Zn–N bond
distances are predicted at 2.504 and 2.133 Å, respectively. As
was observed on the (001) and (101) surfaces, the adsorption of the
4ATP molecule on the (110) surface did not induce significant changes
to the surface; the interacting surface species remained in their
positions with only small vertical displacements (0.03–0.09
Å) relative to the naked surface. By comparing the adsorption
characteristic of 4ATP on the three surfaces, the stronger adsorption
calculated for the configurations involving the thiol (−SH)
end suggests that the S p-orbitals are the driving force for 4ATP
adsorption on the Zn3P2 surfaces. This is consistent
with the dominant contribution of the 3p character of the sulfur atom
to the HOMO of 4ATP (Figure 3b).

= orange, S = yellow; C = grey, and H = white).

3.4 Electronic Properties
Atomic-level
insights into the bonding mechanism of the 4ATP molecule onto the
(001), (101), and (110) Zn3P2 surfaces were
gained through analyses of the PDOS and differential charge density
isosurface contours, which give a chemical picture of hybridization
and electron density redistribution within the 4ATP–Zn3P2 systems. Shown in Figure 7a1–c1 is the density of states projected
on the sulfur and nitrogen p-orbitals of the 4ATP molecule in the
lowest energy configurations at each surface and the interacting Zn
p- and d-states. Consistent with chemisorption, the PDOS plots reveal
strong hybridization between the interacting surface and adsorbate
orbitals, which gave rise to electron density redistributions within
the 4ATP–Zn3P2 systems. This was analyzed
via differential charge density isosurface contours, obtained from
relation 4  where ρ4ATP+surface is the
electron density of the total 4ATP–Zn3P2 system. ρsurface and ρ4ATP electron
density of the naked Zn3P2 surface and that
of the isolated 4ATP molecule with the atomic positions taken to be
the same as those of the relaxed 4ATP–Zn3P2 systems. The iso-surface contour plots displayed in Figure 7a2,b2,c2 reveal electron density
accumulation (green contours) around centers of the newly formed Zn–S
and Zn–N chemical bonds. The observed electron density accumulation
between hydrogen and surface atoms on the (101) surface (Figure 7b2) is characteristic
of hydrogen-bonded interactions, which may contribute to the stabilization
of the 4ATP molecule on the surface. Notwithstanding the local electron
density rearrangements within the 4ATP–Zn3P2 systems, the net charge transfers between the Zn3P2 surfaces and the 4ATP molecule, as estimated from the
Bader partition scheme is very small: 0.11 e– on
the (001) and (101) surfaces and 0.14 e– on the
(110) surface.

Figure 7 PDOS projected on the interacting surface Zn p- and d-states
and
the 4ATP molecule’s N and S p-states at the (a1) (001), (b1)
(101), and (c1) (110) Zn3P2 surfaces. Shown
in (a2–c2) are the corresponding differential charge density
isosurfaces contours, where red and green isosurfaces denote depletion
and accumulation of electron density by ±0.02 e/Å3, respectively.

To ascertain whether
the functionalization of the Zn3P2 surfaces
have any effect on their electronic structures,
the partial DOS of the naked surface was compared with those covered
with the 4ATP molecule as shown in Figure 8. The semiconducting nature of the surfaces
is found to be generally preserved upon 4ATP adsorption with only
small differences in features compared to the naked surfaces. The
band gap of the naked (001), (101), and (110) surfaces, calculated
at 1.12, 1.15, and 1.305 eV, respectively, remain essentially unchanged
upon 4ATP adsorption. Any noticeable differences in features can be
attributed to the small adsorption-induced changes to the atomic positions
of the interacting surface species, which are displaced slightly upward
relative to their position in the naked surfaces. The work function
(Φ), which is one of the most important properties of surfaces
in understanding photoemission and thermionic emission processes,
was calculated for each Zn3P2 surface before
and after 4ATP adsorption (Table 3). The work function was calculated as Φ = Evacuum – EF, where the potential in the vacuum region (Evacuum) and the Fermi energy (EF) were derived from the same calculation. Dipole corrections perpendicular
to all surfaces were accounted for, which ensured that there is no
net dipole perpendicular to the surfaces that may affect the potential
in the vacuum level. The work function of the naked Zn3P2 (001), (101), and (110) surfaces is predicted at 4.32,
4.79, and 4.75 eV, respectively, whereas the 4ATP-functionalized surfaces
have calculated the work function of 4.07, 4.67, and 4.42 eV, respectively.
The lowering of the work functions upon 4ATP adsorption can be attributed
to the adsorption-induced electron density redistribution in the 4ATP-surface
systems.62−64 Besides, the adsorption acts to smoothen the surface
electric charge distribution (the Smoluchowski effect) which lowers
the work function.65,66

3.5 Equilibrium Crystal Morphologies
Following the procedure of Wulff construction and using the calculated
surface energies of the naked and 4ATP-covered surfaces (Table 3), the equilibrium
crystal morphology of the nonfunctionalized and 4ATP-functionalized
Zn3P2 nanocrystal was constructed as shown in Figure 9. The adsorption
of the 4ATP molecule is shown to have a stabilization effect on the
three surfaces studied because the adsorption acts to coordinate the
4ATP molecule to the under coordinated Zn ions, thus providing a closer
bulk coordination of the surface species. The stabilization of the
surfaces is reflected in the lower surface energies calculated for
the 4ATP-functionalized surfaces compared to the naked nonfunctionalized
surfaces (Table 3).
From Figure 9a, it
can be seen that the (001), (110), and (001) facets appear in the
nonfunctionalized Zn3P2 nanocrystals, although
the (101) surface enclosed the largest areas, in agreement with its
surface stability being the most stable among the three surfaces investigated.
The (001) and (110) facets enclose smaller areas in the nonfunctionalized
Zn3P2 nanocrystal. From the adsorption studies,
the stronger binding of the 4ATP molecule onto the (001) and (110)
surfaces, rather than the (101) facet, causes the surface areas enclosed
by these reactive surfaces to increase in the crystal morphology (Figure 9b). The increase
in surface areas can be attributed to increased stability of the (001)
and (110) surfaces upon 4ATP adsorption and this is consistent with
many other crystals grown in the presence of growth-modifying ligands.21,67 The results demonstrate the selectivity of the 4ATP functional groups
toward stabilizing the different Zn3P2 surfaces,
favoring the expression of the more reactive surfaces in the particle
morphology. Increasing the 4ATP coverage on the Zn3P2 surfaces may likely results in further expression of the
reactive (001) and (110) surfaces in the equilibrium morphology.

4 Summary and Conclusions
The organic functionalization
of the (001), (101), and (110) surface
Zn3P2 with 4ATP molecule has been studied by
means of first-principles dispersion corrected DFT-D3 calculations.
In particular, the effects of 4ATP adsorption on the structural and
electronic properties of naked Zn3P2 surfaces
have been elucidated. The lowest-energy adsorption geometries are
predicted to be a monodentate Zn–S-slant configuration on the
(001), monodentate Zn–S-flat configuration on the (101), and
bidentate Zn–NS–Zn configuration on the (110) surfaces,
which released adsorption energies of −1.91, −1.21,
and −1.35 eV, respectively. The adsorption of the 4ATP onto
Zn3P2 surfaces is shown to be driven by strong
hybridization between the 4ATP molecule’s S and N p-orbitals
and the d-orbitals of the interacting surface Zn ions, which resulted
in the formation of strong Zn–S and Zn–N chemical bonds.
The final equilibrium morphology of Zn3P2 is
modulated by 4ATP adsorption, with the reactive (001) and (110) surfaces
becoming more pronounced in the equilibrium morphology relative to
the (101) facet. The surface work function is shown to be lowered
by 4ATP adsorption but the electronic band gap of the Zn3P2 surfaces remained significantly unaffected. This work
provides an atomic-level understanding of the interactions of 4ATP
species with Zn3P2 nanoparticles and the results
discussed here may be relevant for future investigations of self-assembled
4ATP monolayers and other higher coverage structures.
