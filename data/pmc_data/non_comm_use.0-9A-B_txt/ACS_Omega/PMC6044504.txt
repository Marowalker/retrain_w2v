A superfast, room-temperature,
one-step carrier-solvent-assisted
interfacial reaction process was developed to prepare Ag/AgFeO2 composite nanocrystals (NCs) of less than 10 nm in size within
a 1 min reaction time. These composite NCs were with a direct energy
band gap of 2.0 eV and were paramagnetic, making them suitable for
optical activation and magnetic manipulation. These composite NCs,
applied as a photocatalyst for the treatment of HeLa cells, achieved
a significant reduction of 74% in cell viability within 30 min. These

Introduction
Cancer is one of the
leading causes of mortality as well as morbidity
worldwide. Current medical treatments for cancers include surgery,
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy as well as stem cell transplant.
Unfortunately, these treatment options often bring side effects to
patients. Some side effects can even take over the patient’s
daily life. Therefore, developing a new treatment option that minimizes
the side effect is urgently needed.

Photocatalysts, capable
of producing highly oxidative photoinduced
holes and highly reductive photoinduced electrons upon absorption
of optical energies, have been intensively applied in pollutant degradation,
air purification, and bacteria eradication.1−7 The highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the reactions
between the photoinduced charge carriers, electrons and holes, and
the oxygen and water molecules adsorbed on the surfaces of the photocatalyst
play the key role in achieving the intended functionality of the above-mentioned
applications. The ROS, in fact, exist in normal cells, the so-called
intracellular ROS, and act as an intracellular signaling messenger,
involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, metabolic alterations,
and angiogenesis.8 A suitable level of
ROS is necessary for cell survival, while excessive amounts of ROS
can trigger cell apoptosis through damaging the membrane and interior
of the cells. Over the past few years, applications of photocatalysts
in cancer cell treatment grab the attention of researchers in the
area and emerge as a promising alternative to the traditional cancer
treatment options that suffer from severe side effects.9−13

In recent years, spinel-structured materials, such as Fe3O4, ZnFe2O4, and SnFe2O4, have been demonstrated as a class of outstanding
photocatalysts
for pollutant degradation.3,14−19 Silver ferrite, AgFeO2, a much less studied spinel-structured
photocatalyst, is expected to exhibit decent photocatalytic activities
and is thus a promising candidate as a photocatalyst for cancer cell
treatment. In addition, silver particles are widely used in medical
applications because of their superior performances in preventing
microbial infections.20 Silver particles
are also found to exhibit excellent performances in wound healing,
diagnosis, and pharmacological treatments.21 Silver however is comparatively more expensive, making the treatments
that involve silver particles economically less advantageous.22 To reduce the usage of silver, compositing a
minor amount of Ag with a major constituent of AgFeO2 may
prove a promising effective photocatalyst option for cancer cell treatment.

In this study, a superfast, room-temperature, one-step carrier-solvent-assisted
interfacial reaction process was developed to prepare Ag/AgFeO2 composite nanocrystals (NCs). This newly developed photocatalyst
possessed a narrow energy band gap of 2.0 eV, making it suitable for
light-triggered photocatalytic functions, and was paramagnetic, feasible
for magnetic guiding and targeting when in use for practical cancer
treatments.

HeLa cells, one of the most recalcitrant cancer
cells, have often
been taken as the model cancer cells for the development of cancer
cell treatments. Previously developed photocatalysts for treating
the HeLa cells are mainly based on TiO2, the most well-known
and studied photocatalyst, mostly metal-decorated or metal-doped.23−32 The synthetic methods for these and other photocatalysts often involve
complicated procedures,23−27,29−38 long preparation times,23,26,27,29,31−37 and/or high temperatures/pressures.10,23,26−29,31,32,34,37,38 Furthermore, the HeLa cell treatment utilizing
the above-mentioned photocatalysts often require high photocatalyst
dosages (>100 μg/mL)23,27,28,30,31,34,35,38 and long treatment times (>100 min).23,28,31,38 In this study, we developed a simple one-step carrier-solvent-assisted
interfacial reaction process that can produce Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs of less than 10 nm in size at room temperature under
ambient pressure with only 1 min reaction time. The Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs achieved a significant reduction of 74% in cell viability
toward the HeLa cells at a photocatalyst dosage of 40 μg/mL
and 30 min treatment time. Most importantly, the Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs, unlike previously developed photocatalysts, are magnetically
responsive and thus feasible for magnetic guiding and targeting when
in practical use. The present Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs prove
to be a promising magnetically guidable photocatalyst for cancer cell
treatment.

Results and Discussion
Characterizations of the Photocatalyst, Ag/AgFeO2
The product photocatalyst first characterized its
crystalline
composition with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. As evident
from Figure 1, the
product photocatalyst was composed of two crystalline components,
Ag (JCPDS 04-0783) and AgFeO2 (JCPDS 70-1452), without
the presence of silver oxides and iron oxides. Five major diffraction
peaks located at the 2θ values of 28.4, 34.8, 61.0, 68.5, and
72.7° were identified for AgFeO2 and two minor ones
located at 38.1 and 77.4° were attributed to Ag. It can be concluded
from the comparison of the diffraction peak intensities that AgFeO2 was the major component of the photocatalyst with Ag as the
minor one. Furthermore, the grain size of AgFeO2 can be
estimated to be around 6.7 nm with the Scherrer equation based on
the full width at half-maximum value of the most pronounced diffraction
peak located at 34.8°. The photocatalyst, termed Ag/AgFeO2, was paramagnetic and can be collected with an externally
applied magnetic field. The photograph shown as the inset of Figure 1 demonstrates the
excellent magnetic collectability of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs.
All Ag/AgFeO2 NCs were securely adhered to the tube wall
with a magnet. This magnetic responsiveness confirms that AgFeO2 is the major constituent of the photocatalyst because Ag
is not magnetically responsive. The magnetic responsiveness of the
photocatalyst is advantageous when the photocatalyst is applied for
cancer cell treatment because magnetic guiding and targeting are possible.

of the product photocatalyst. Inset: Magnetic collection
of Ag/AgFeO2 NCs.

The morphology, size, and crystalline structure of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs were examined by using a high-resolution transmission
electron microscope. Figure 2a shows a typical high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) image of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs at low magnification.
It is to be stressed that because of the paramagnetism of the sample,
the NCs drifted around under the bombardment of the high-energy electron
beam, and it was thus difficult to obtain sharp TEM images of the
sample. When examined carefully, one can identify the NCs and estimate
their sizes.

Figure 2 (A,B) HRTEM images of Ag/AgFeO2 NCs.

The NC size distribution thus
determined based on 250 NCs is presented
in Figure S1, which shows most of the sizes
of the NCs fall in the range of 6–7 nm. This crystal size is
in good agreement with the grain size, 6.7 nm, estimated from the
XRD pattern. Figure 2b shows another HRTEM image, from which the interlayer distances
of 0.26, 0.13, 0.31, and 0.24 nm can be determined, matching well
with the d-spacing of the (1 0 1), (2 0 1), and (0
0 4) lattice planes of AgFeO2 and the (1 1 1) lattice planes
of Ag, respectively. Furthermore, the inset shows a single NC with
the lattice planes of both Ag and AgFeO2 identified, confirming
the composite structure of the Ag/AgFeO2 NC.

The
composition of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs was determined
with EDX spectroscopy. The atomic ratio of Ag versus Fe was determined
to be around 1.1:1, with Ag slightly higher than Fe, consistent with
the composition of major AgFeO2 combined with minor Ag.
Note that the signal of Pt identified in the spectrum came from the
pretreatment of the sample with Pt to enhance the electrical conductivity
of the sample. Furthermore, the elemental EDX mapping was conducted
to further study the composition of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs.
The mapping of Ag (green) and Fe (red) was shown in the inset of Figure 3. Evidently, both
Ag and Fe were uniformly distributed throughout the sample, implying
a uniform coupling of Ag and AgFeO2 instead of separate
phases of Ag and AgFeO2.

Inset: Area mapping of Ag and Fe elements.

The energy band gap of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs was determined
with the UV–vis absorption spectrum as shown in Figure 4. The onset absorption wavelength
was determined to be 620 nm, corresponding to an energy band gap of
2.0 eV. The energy band gap can be more accurately determined by converting
the UV–vis spectrum into the corresponding Tauc plot, the inset
of Figure 4, from which
a value of 2.0 eV was obtained for the energy band gap, in excellent
agreement with that determined from the onset absorption wavelength.
The Ag/AgFeO2 NCs, with an energy band gap much smaller
than 3.1 eV, can thus be effectively triggered with UV light to generate
photoinduced electrons and holes, from which hydroxyl radicals, a
powerful ROS, are produced for the eradication of cancer cells.

Cell Treatment Efficacy
of Ag/AgFeO2 NCs
The Ag/AgFeO2 NCs
were applied as a photocatalyst in cancer
cell treatment, taking HeLa cells as a model. The efficacy of the
Ag/AgFeO2 NCs on the eradication of HeLa cells was evaluated
with the cell viability and cell morphology upon treating HeLa cells
with the NCs under UV irradiation. The cell viability and cell morphology
data were collected at three different stages: before treatment, after
treatment, and 24 h of regrowth after treatment. The comparison between
the results of cell viability and cell morphology before and after
the treatment gives immediate indication on the performance of the
Ag/AgFeO2 treatment. As to the 24 h regrowth after treatment,
its purpose is to study the recovery of the cells from photodamage,
a further confirmation of the cell apoptosis.

Light irradiation,
concentration of the photocatalyst, and treatment time are three main
parameters to be investigated. We designed four sets of experiments,
as summarized in Table S1, to study the
efficacy of the Ag/AgFeO2 treatment. Experiment 1, without
the application of both light irradiation and photocatalysts, served
as a control to highlight the effects of light irradiation and photocatalysts.
When conducting the experiments, the cells were transferred from a
CO2-guarded incubator to a biosafety cabinet for sample
preparation, and the subsequent treatment was carried out in a UV
transilluminator where no controlled level of CO2 was provided.
Therefore, experiment 1 also served the purpose of investigating the
effect of ambient conditions on the cell viability and cell morphology
within the experimental time frame. Meanwhile, experiments 2 and 3,
with the application of only light irradiation or photocatalysts,
respectively, were designed to investigate the effects of plain light
irradiation or photocatalysts on the test cells. Experiment 4, with
the application of both light irradiation and photocatalysts, served
as the main experiment to evaluate the efficacy of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs on HeLa cell eradication. The cell viability was determined
as the percentage of the number of living cells against total cell
number. In this study, trypan blue, a blue color dye, was used to
quantify the cell viability. Living cells, protected by cell walls,
can resist the penetration of trypan blue and remain unstained, whereas
dead cells, with the cell walls damaged, can be penetrated by trypan
blue and appeared blue under an inverted microscope. Figure S2 illustrates the difference between unstained living
cells and trypan blue stained dead cells under an inverted microscope.
Cell counts were then carried out on the total number of the stained
and unstained cells to quantify the cell viability.

The cell
viability data obtained from experiments 1–3 at
three stages with treatment times up to 30 min were compiled in Figure S3 as histogram plots. Both mean values
and standard deviations (based on the three experiments) were indicated
in the histograms. Evidently, no significant cell eradication was
achieved with all three sets of experiments. A slight reduction in
the cell viability, around 4%, was within the experimental errors.
The results of experiment 1 confirm that HeLa cells are strong enough
to survive in the ambient condition. The results of experiments 2
and 3 indicate that neither light irradiation nor photocatalysts alone
can do harm to HeLa cells.

Figure 5 shows the
cell viability results for experiment 4 conducted at three increasing
concentrations of Ag/AgFeO2 NCs. The results confirm that
the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs under UV light irradiation can effect
cell eradication. The Ag/AgFeO2 NCs, with an energy band
gap of 2.0 eV, were able to absorb UV light to generate photoinduced
electrons and holes, from which hydroxyl radicals, a powerful ROS,
were subsequently created to attack the cells. Several points can
be made from Figure 5. First, the cell viability decreased with increasing treatment time.
This is expected because ROS generation continued with the increasing
treatment time to effect an increasing extent of cell eradication.
Second, the cell viability generally dropped further after 24 h of
regrowth. This implies that the cell eradication continued during
the regrowth period. Third, the cell eradication performance depends
critically on the concentration of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs, with
an optimal concentration of 40 μg/mL, achieving a significant
reduction in the cell viability of 74% before and after the treatment.
The reduction in cell viability achieved with the Ag/AgFeO2 concentrations of 20 and 60 μg/mL at the end of 30 min treatment
was only 20 and 13%, respectively. This drastic effect of the photocatalyst
concentration may be explained as follows. Theoretically, the more
the photocatalyst exists in the system, the more the ROS is generated
for cell eradication. The generation of ROS however occurs at the
particle surface of the photocatalyst. These photocatalyst NCs aggregate
to a certain extent in the culture medium, thus reducing the effective
exposed surfaces for the ROS generation. Figure 6 shows the size distributions of the Ag/AgFeO2 NC suspensions of 20, 40, and 60 μg/mL determined with
the dynamic light scattering spectroscopy. The polydispersity indices
of the 20, 40, and 60 μg/mL Ag/AgFeO2 NC suspensions
were 0.363, 0.407, and 0.603, respectively. It is evident that the
Ag/AgFeO2 NCs are prone to aggregation because of their
large surface-to-volume ratios,39 and the
Ag/AgFeO2 NCs aggregated to some extent forming larger-sized
particle clusters. The extent of aggregation becomes more severe as
the Ag/AgFeO2 NC concentration increases, with the size
distribution shifting toward the larger size side. The competition
between the amount of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs present in the
system and the aggregation extent experienced by the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs leads to the existence of an optimum Ag/AgFeO2 NC concentration of 40 μg/mL. This phenomenon explains why
the reduction in cell viability was the lowest at 60 μg/mL and
the highest at 40 μg/mL.

before treatment, blue denotes after treatment, and green denotes
24 h regrowth after treatment.

In addition to cell viability measurements, the treatment
outcome
can also be characterized with observation of the cell morphology
at different treatment stages. The cell morphology was recorded with
an inverted microscope at the three treatment stages: before treatment,
after treatment, and 24 h regrowth after the treatment. For this morphological
study, cell confluence of more than 95% was ensured before the treatment. Figure S4 shows typical microscopic images for
the HeLa cell samples with confluency much less and slightly greater
than 95%. Cell samples with confluency much less than 95% can be observed
with cells separated from one another. Dead cells shrink and detach
from the walls, giving reduced confluency. Therefore, the microscopic
images offer a qualitative visualizable measure of the cell treatment
outcome.

Figure S5 shows the morphology
of the
test cells at the three treatment stages at the end of the 30 min
treatment for experiment 1. Regardless of the treatment stage, all
three images exhibited high confluency close to 100%, in consistent
with the cell viability data. The HeLa cells survive well in ambient
conditions. For experiment 4, Figure 7 shows the corresponding cell images at the three treatment
stages for photocatalyst concentrations of 20, 40, and 60 μg/mL.
The trends in confluency reduction match very well with those observed
in the cell viability. The reduction in confluency was the most pronounced
for the case of 40 μg/mL, only limited for the case of 20 μg/mL,
and the least for the case of 60 μg/mL after treatment. The
black objects observed in the images are large aggregated Ag/AgFeO2 particles.

The production of hydroxyl
radicals during the photocatalytic treatment
is responsible for destroying the cell membrane and subsequent apoptosis
of the cells. It is thus interesting to investigate the correlation
between the production of the hydroxyl radicals and the cell apoptosis.
A photoluminescence (PL)-based technique was developed for the quantification
of hydroxyl radicals.40,41 Coumarin is used as a probe molecule
to detect the formation of hydroxyl radicals because it reacts with
the hydroxyl radicals to form a highly fluorescent 7-hydroxycoumarin
molecule, which emitted PL light at 456 nm with an excitation wavelength
of 332 nm. The higher the concentration of the hydroxyl radical, the
higher the intensity of the PL. Figure 8 shows the PL spectra recorded for characterizing the
hydroxyl radical concentration generated from the Ag/AgFeO2 NC suspensions of 20, 40, and 60 μg/mL at illumination times
of 0, 15, and 30 min, respectively. It is evident that the hydroxyl
radical concentration increases with the increasing reaction time,
and the Ag/AgFeO2 suspension of 40 μg/mL gives the
highest hydroxyl radical concentration, with that of 20 coming next
and 60 the last, in good agreement with the cell apoptosis results
obtained.

Conclusions
Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs of less than 10 nm in size were
prepared with a one-step carrier-solvent-assisted interfacial reaction
process. The process proceeded at room temperature under ambient pressure
and produced the composite NCs in one step within 1 min. The main
constituent of the composite NC, AgFeO2, is a paramagnetic
narrow band gap semiconductor with a direct energy band gap of 2.0
eV, suitable for UV light activation and magnetic manipulation. These
composite NCs were applied as a photocatalyst for the treatment of
the HeLa cells, one of the most recalcitrant cancer cells. The presence
of UV light or photocatalyst alone did no harm to the cancer cells.
However, the irradiation of the photocatalyst with UV light achieved
a significant reduction of 74% in cell viability within a 30 min treatment
time. The Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs were thus proved to be
a promising magnetically guidable photocatalyst for the treatment
of the HeLa cells. The HeLa cell eradication effectiveness of the
present photocatalyst was compared with those of the previously reported
works in Table S2. The Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs appear to be a superior choice considering the low
catalyst concentration and short treatment time involved, not to mention
the potential magnetically guidable capability.

Experimental Section
Materials
Materials used in the present study included
AgNO3 (Acros, 99%), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (J. T. Baker, 98%), ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), chloroform
(Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), aqueous NaOH solution, 0.25% trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich), 90% ethanol solution, fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest), HeLa cell line, penicillin (Millipore),
phosphate-buffered saline (Amresco), RPMI 1640 medium (Matrioux (M)
SDN BHD), and sodium hydrogen carbonate (BioWhittaker). All chemicals
were used as received without further purification.

Preparation
of Ag/AgFeO2 Composite NCs
The
Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs were prepared with a one-step carrier-solvent-assisted
interfacial reaction process.39 Briefly,
0.1 g of AgNO3 and 0.4756 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 22.5 mL of ethanol to serve
as a precursor solution. An amount of 3.75 mL precursor solution was
added into chloroform of equal volume. An amount of 7.5 mL aqueous
NaOH solution (0.8 M), lighter than and immiscible with chloroform,
was then added to the above solution to generate an interface between
the aqueous and chloroform domains. Ethanol, miscible with both water
and chloroform but having higher affinity toward water, served as
the carrier solvent, carrying the precursor from the lower chloroform
domain to the upper aqueous domain to react for the formation of Ag/AgFeO2 composite NCs through sol–gel reactions. The reaction
time was controlled to be 1 min.

Cancer Cell Culture and
Viability Assay
The HeLa cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (pH 7) supplemented by 9.9% FBS
and 0.99% penicillin in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Here, penicillin was added to reduce the
possibility of microbial contamination in the cell culture, whereas
FBS served as the nutrient source for the cancer cells. The cell confluence,
observed with an inverted microscope at a magnification of 10×,
was controlled to be over 95% before any photocatalytic treatments,
and cell viability tests can be performed.

The cell viability
was determined with a hemocytometer using the trypan blue staining
method to differentiate the living from the dead cells. The cell membrane
of a living cell is impermeable to trypan blue, whereas the compromised
cell membrane of a dead cell allows permeation of trypan blue, from
which the cell viability can be readily determined with an inverted
microscope at a magnification of 10×. The cell samples were first
detached from the cell culture flask wall with an appropriate amount
of 0.25% trypsin–EDTA solution to form the cell suspension.
The cell suspension was then mixed with an equal volume of trypan
blue for the possible staining for microscopic observation.

Cancer
Cell Treatment with a Photocatalyst
Prior to
the photocatalytic treatment, the cell sample was examined under an
inverted microscope to ensure sufficient confluence. For the photocatalytic
treatment experiment, the old culture medium was replaced with a new
culture medium containing the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs of a desired
concentration and incubated for 48 h. The culture was then irradiated
with UV light provided by a UV transilluminator (Gel Logic 112, Carestream)
at room temperature for a desired time duration before the cell viability
determination. After the photocatalytic treatment, the photocatalyst-containing
medium was replaced with fresh culture medium, and the treated cell
sample was incubated for another 24 h to investigate the regrowth
of the survivor cells. All experiments were conducted in triplicate.

The effects of two treatment parameters, the concentration of the
Ag/AgFeO2 NCs and the duration of light irradiation, were
investigated. The concentration of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs was
increased from 0 to 60 μg/mL at a 20 μg/mL interval, whereas
the duration of light irradiation was increased from 0 to 30 min at
a 5 min interval. Four groups of experimental setting, summarized
in Table S1, were compared to reveal the
detailed functionality of the Ag/AgFeO2 NCs on killing
the HeLa cells. The first group was without the presence of a photocatalyst
and light irradiation. The purpose of this group was to investigate
how strong the HeLa cells were at ambient conditions away from their
comfort zone, 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The second
group was treated with the photocatalyst without light irradiation,
whereas the third group was irradiated with light in the absence of
a photocatalyst. The fourth group had both photocatalyst and light
irradiation in action. From the comparison of the last three groups,
one can reveal the roles played by the photocatalyst and light irradiation
in HeLa cell eradication.

Measurement of Hydroxyl Radicals
Typically, 1 mL of
10–3 M coumarin aqueous solution was added into
2 mL of Ag/AgFeO2 photocatalyst suspensions of 20, 40,
and 60 μg/mL, and the PL intensity at 456 nm was recorded at
a 5 min interval for 30 min under light illumination.

Characterizations
The crystalline structure of the
photocatalyst was characterized with an X-ray diffractometer (MAC
Science, MXP18, Cu Kα). The morphology and crystalline structure
of the photocatalyst were observed with a high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-3000F, 300 kV). The band gap of the
photocatalyst was determined with UV–vis spectroscopy (Hitachi,
U-2800). EDX spectroscopy (Oxford 6587, Oxford Instruments) was conducted
to determine the elemental composition of the photocatalyst. The size
distribution of the NC suspension was determined with dynamic light
scattering spectroscopy (Malvern ZEN1600), in which DI water was used
as the solvent. The PL spectra were recorded with a fluorescence spectrometer
(Hitachi F-4500). The cell images were observed and taken using an
inverted microscope (Olympus CKX41).
