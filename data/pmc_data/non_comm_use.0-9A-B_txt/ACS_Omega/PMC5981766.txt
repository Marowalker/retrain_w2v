Arsenic trioxide
(As2O3) is an environmental
carcinogen and a putative endocrine disruptor. Resveratrol has been
shown to reverse As2O3-induced oxidative damage.
In immortalized but nontransformed estrogen receptor α-negative
human breast cells (MCF10A), we observed that 25 μM resveratrol
ameliorated As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. As2O3, in the presence or absence of 25 μM resveratrol,
induced quinone reductase (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1), via the
induction of NFE2-related factor 2. As2O3 caused
a repression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1B1, but the addition of 25 μM
resveratrol rescued the expression of cytochrome P450 1B1 and kept
it at a constant level. Therefore, 25 μM resveratrol can modulate
the effects of As2O3 on enzymes involved in
estrogen metabolism.

Introduction
Arsenic is the 20th
most abundant element in the earth’s
crust, and trivalent arsenic trioxide (As2O3) contaminates groundwater in many places, leading to arsenic poisoning
or arsenicosis.1 Arsenic and inorganic
arsenic compounds have been classified as IARC Group 1 carcinogens,2 with lung, bladder, kidney, and liver as the
predominant targets. At the same time, As2O3 (Trisenox or arsenic trioxide) is being used as a chemotherapy drug
against acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), where it selectively kills
the leukemic cells but allows the proper development of regular blood
cells.3 Interestingly, arsenic has long
been implicated in endocrine disruption. Target genes for glucocorticoids,
androgens, mineralocorticoids, and progestin receptors have also been
reported to be regulated by inorganic arsenic in a biphasic dose-response
fashion.4 To address such documented carcinogenicity
and putative endocrine disruption, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has set the maximum contaminant level for As2O3 at 10 ppb.5

The principal
pathways implicated in As2O3 toxicity result
from reactive oxygen species, oxidative DNA damage,
and induction of apoptosis. Resveratrol, a well-known dietary stilbene,
has been shown to protect normal human bronchial epithelial cells
from As2O3 toxicity by maintaining glutathione
homeostasis.6 Cardiotoxicity, a major side
effect of using As2O3 for APL, could be ameliorated
in Wistar rats by resveratrol, via the maintenance of a balanced expression
of the NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-heme oxygenase (HO) 1 pathway,
and by promoting arsenic efflux from cells.7 Employing similar mechanisms, resveratrol has been reported to protect
from As2O3-induced nephrotoxicity in male Wistar
rats8 and from hepatotoxicity in Chinese
Dragon-Li cats.9 Finally, research by at
least one group has demonstrated the ability of inorganic arsenic
to promote carcinogenesis via a nonestrogen receptor (ER)-mediated
pathway: chronic exposure (18 weeks) to environmentally relevant 0.5
μM arsenite promoted cancer cell phenotypes in human prostate
epithelial stem/progenitor cells (WPE-stem)10 and in their isogenic parental RWPE-1 cells (30 weeks).11 Chronic exposure (24 weeks) to low-level arsenite
(500 nM) has also been reported to do the same thing in human breast
epithelial cells (MCF10A) via the overexpression of aromatase.12 To the best of our knowledge, no studies have
explored any protective role of resveratrol in As2O3-induced carcinogenesis via non-ER-mediated pathways.

Estrogens have been implicated in the development of a variety
of cancers. Several types of evidence suggest the role of estrogen
in tumor development in an ER knock-out transgenic mouse model of
breast cancer,13 as well as in the transformation
of ERα-negative breast epithelial cells (MCF10F).14 To explain such receptor-independent pathways
for cancer initiation, it has been hypothesized that the metabolism
of estrogens/androgens generates catechol quinones that can react
with DNA, leading to the formation of apurinic sites and mutations,
to initiate oncogenic transformation.15 In high-risk groups and cancer patients (women: breast, ovarian,
and thyroid; men: prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), an imbalance
in estrogen metabolism stems from irregular expression patterns of
one or more of the four key estrogen-metabolizing enzymes: cytochrome
P450 19 or aromatase, cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), catechol-O-methyltransferase, and quinone reductase (NAD(P)H quinone
dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1)).15 Certain naturally
occurring or synthetic compounds have the ability to alter the expression
of some of these enzymes; for example, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) can induce CYP1B1, whereas resveratrol antagonizes
this effect. At the same time, resveratrol can induce NQO1.15 Our laboratory has shown that preincubation
with 25 μM resveratrol for 48 h significantly lowered the production
of estrogen-DNA adduct formation in ERα-negative human breast
epithelial MCF10F cells.16 Therefore, in
this study, the effects of As2O3 on the expression
levels of key estrogen-metabolizing enzymes (NQO1 and CYP1B1), and
on the signaling molecule Nrf2, were studied in the presence or absence
of 25 μM resveratrol in immortalized but nontransformed ERα-negative
human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A).

Results and Discussion
As2O3 exhibited cytotoxicity at both 48 and
72 h, with an IC50 at 1.45 μM for 48 h treatment
(Figure 1A), which
is an environmentally significant exposure. However, the presence
of resveratrol, which also has some cytotoxicity (Figure 1B) at 25 μM, reduced
this cytotoxicity by shifting the survival curves to the right. The
IC50 for the combined 48 h As2O3 and
resveratrol treatment was 28.69 μM. The rightward shift in the
survival curve was lesser for 72 h treatment compared to that for
48 h treatment (Figure 1C). This indicates that the rescue effect from resveratrol is more
pronounced at 48 h.

(As2O3) + 25 μM resveratrol. Data are
presented as mean ± standard error of the mean cell survival
(%) from six independent experiments (n = 6).

As2O3, with
or without 25 μM resveratrol,
induced the enzyme NQO1 in a dose-dependent manner, but no additive
or synergistic effects were observed (Figure 2A,B). Resveratrol has been shown to act via
the signaling molecule Nrf2, and NQO1 has been implicated as a downstream
gene of Nrf2.17 This prompted us to study
the effect of As2O3 on the expression level
of Nrf2. As2O3, in both the presence and absence
of 25 μM resveratrol, induced Nrf2 in a dose-dependent fashion,
but again no additive or synergistic effects were observed (Figure 2C,D). Our finding
is in accordance with a study in mouse hepatoma cell line hepa1c1c7,
in which arsenic was shown to induce Nrf2 protein in a dose-dependent
fashion, leading to a robust induction of NQO1.18 Furthermore, in MCF10A cells the extent of induction was
much greater for Nrf2 compared to that for NQO1, but this may stem
from the fact that resting cells have a very low-level basal expression
of Nrf2 (t1/2 = 10–20 min).19 Similarly, disproportionate induction of NQO1
and Nrf2 by As2O3 has been reported in male
Kunming mouse testis in both the presence and absence of antioxidants
such as lutein.20

CYP1B1 is another key estrogen-metabolizing enzyme that is
overexpressed
in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, and is subject to
regulation through both hormonal and a putative aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) pathways; the latter can be modulated by resveratrol.21 Previous studies on the male C57Bl/6 mouse heart
have reported that 12.5 mg/kg As(III) induces CYP1B1 mRNA levels by
150%.22 We observed, however, that As2O3 treatment (0.5–5 μM) of human breast
epithelial MCF10A cells caused a repression of CYP1B1 protein in a
dose-dependent manner. Resveratrol was earlier shown to downregulate
TCDD-induced CYP1B1 expression in MCF10F cells.23 Interestingly, the addition of 25 μM resveratrol
rescued As2O3-suppressed CYP1B1 expression and
kept it at a nearly constant level (Figure 3A,B). To confirm this interesting observation,
the expression of CYP1B1 enzyme was further studied simultaneously
in three different nontransformed cell lines derived from human breast
epithelia, namely MCF10A, MCF10F, and MCF12F cells. In this study,
the cells were also treated with a higher dose of 7.5 μM As2O3. The repressive effect of As2O3 on CYP1B1 expression was less pronounced in MCF10F cells,
leaving little room for resveratrol to exert any rescue effect (Supporting
Information, Figure S1B). Furthermore,
such repressive effect of As2O3 on CYP1B1 expression
was altogether absent in MCF12F cells (Supporting Information, Figure S1C). Collectively, these results suggest
different degrees of modulatory effects of As2O3. One possibility is its differential cytotoxicity, as we have observed
between MCF10A and MCF12F cells (IC50 value for MCF10A
is 1.45 μM for 48 h treatment, whereas the same for MCF12F is
11.65 μM; Figure 1A vs Supporting Information Figure S2).
As2O3 is not considered a ligand for AhR; therefore,
the observed effects of As2O3 might be mediated
through a hormonal pathway.

difference (p < 0.05) between As2O3 treatment groups and control, whereas an * indicates significant
difference (p < 0.05) between one particular As2O3 treatment with the inclusion or exclusion of
resveratrol.

Conclusions
In
the present study involving nontransformed
breast epithelial MCF10A cells, 25 μM resveratrol was shown
to ameliorate As2O3-induced cytotoxicity, with
the beneficial effect being more prominent after 48 h treatment. As
expected, both As2O3 and resveratrol induced
the expression of the catechol quinone-quenching enzyme NQO1, possibly
via the induction of the signaling protein Nrf2. To the best of our
knowledge, however, this is the first time resveratrol has been shown
to rescue As2O3-suppressed CYP1B1 expression
back to the baseline levels. Collectively, these results suggest that
25 μM resveratrol has the ability to modulate the effects of
As2O3 on the expression of estrogen-metabolizing
enzymes in MCF10A cells. Whether such modulation leads to any potential
benefit in estrogen metabolism and carcinogenesis needs to be addressed
in future studies of the effects of As2O3 and
resveratrol on estrogen metabolism.

Experimental Procedures
Cytotoxicity
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (seeding
density: MCF10A 3000 cells per well, MCF12F 5000 cells per well) in
estrogen- and phenol-red-indicator-free media and treated with 0.5–50
μM total concentration of As2O3 (purity
> 99.5%; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 12.5–200 μM
total
concentration of resveratrol (purity ≥ 98%; Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, MI), or 0.5–50 μM total concentration of As2O3 + 25 μM resveratrol for two time points
(48 and 72 h). Finally, MTT (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used to
assess the cell viability.

Protein Expression Studies
Expression
levels of the
key estrogen-metabolizing enzymes NQO1 and CYP1B1 and of cell signaling
protein Nrf2 were studied under different treatment regimens. Cells
were seeded in a 6-well plate (seeding density: MCF10A and MCF10F
0.8 × 106 cells per well, MCF12F 1 × 106 cells per well) in estrogen- and phenol-red-indicator-free media
and treated with 0.5–5 μM total concentration of As2O3 ± 25 μM resveratrol for 48 h. Following
cell lysis with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), total
protein was estimated by the Bradford assay, and 10–30 μg
of total protein was resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred
to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes. The membranes were probed
with anti-NQO1, anti-Nrf2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-CYP1B1 (LSBio,
Seattle, WA), or anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) primary
antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies for 1 h
at room temperature. Detection was performed with ECL Western Blotting
Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare/Amersham, Little Chalfont, U.K.).
Both the treatment and western blotting were performed three times
to achieve statistical significance.

Statistical Analysis
To determine whether the differences
observed were statistically significant, a 2-sample t-test was performed. α was set at 0.05 for all statistical
tests, and data with p < 0.05 were considered
to be significantly different.
