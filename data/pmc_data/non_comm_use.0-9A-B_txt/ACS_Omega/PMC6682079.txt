Catalytic
arene reduction was effectively realized by heating in 2-propanol/water
in the presence of Pt on carbon (Pt/C) and metallic Fe. 2-Propanol
acted as a hydrogen source, obviating the need for flammable (and
hence, dangerous and hard-to-handle) hydrogen gas, while metallic
Fe acted as an essential co-catalyst to promote reduction. The chemical
states of Pt and Fe in the reaction mixture were determined by X-ray
absorption near-edge structure analysis, and the obtained results
were used to suggest a plausible reaction mechanism, implying that
catalytic reduction involved Pt- and Fe-mediated single-electron transfer
and the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol.

1 Introduction
Arene
reduction is a useful method of preparing cyclohexane derivatives,
which are utilized as functional materials,1 liquid organic hydrogen carriers in the energy field,2 etc. However, the reduction (hydrogenation) of
resonance-stabilized arenes generally requires the use of excess H2 gas,3 the industrial production
of which from fossil fuels such as CH4 is accompanied by
CO2 emission. Moreover, the transportation, storage, and
usage of H2 gas are strictly regulated by law.4 Therefore, reduction not involving the utilization
of H2 is obviously advantageous from the viewpoint of safety,
ease of handling, and avoidance of special equipment usage. Therefore,
catalytic transfer hydrogenation using biomass bearing a large amount
of alcohol moiety and its analogue-like partial structure within the
molecule has been eagerly investigated,5 and bimetallic Fe- and Pd-catalyzed reductions have also been reported.6 We have continuously developed methods of heterogeneously
catalyzed dehydrogenation of organic substrates (e.g., alcohols7 and cyclohexane derivatives8) and investigated ways of mechanochemical H2 generation from water,9a,9b alkanes,9c and ether9c to avoid
CO2 emission. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in situ
generated H2 can be directly utilized for reduction,9,10 as exemplified by Pt on carbon (Pt/C)-catalyzed arene reduction
in 2-propanol (2-PrOH) as a solvent and hydrogen source (Scheme 1, A).10b Unexpectedly, although this reduction proceeded
smoothly in a sealed stainless steel tube, it could not be realized
in a sealed glass tube. Our recent screening of metallic additives
revealed that zero-valent Fe is an essential co-catalyst for arene
reduction (Scheme 1, B). Although a bimetallic system containing Pt and Fe was previously
utilized to control the catalyst activity in the hydrogenation of
ethylene,11a cinnamaldehyde,11b and other aldehydes,11c,11d all of these reductions could be realized in the presence of Pt
alone. Hydrogenations promoted by bimetallic catalysts comprising
Fe and Pt group metals other than Pt (Rh,12a Pd,11c,12b,12c and Ru11c) were also reported, and the performances of
these catalysts were heavily reliant on the reaction conditions. For
example, Pt–Fe11d and Pd–Fe12b catalysts inhibited the hydrogenation of furan
and benzene rings. Herein, we demonstrate that Pt/C-catalyzed arene
reduction can be switched on/off by the presence/absence of Fe and
perform X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis to
suggest a mechanistic explanation. The metal-containing reaction apparatus,
such as a sealed stainless steel tube, etc., is generally utilized
in the reactions under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.
In contrast with the Pt/C- and Fe-catalyzed arene reduction, H–D
exchange reaction of arenes could proceed without the reduction of
arene moiety in the glass flask under the similar reaction conditions
using Pt/C in 2-PrOH and D2O instead of H2O.13 Therefore, the present phenomenon is valuable
to alert the chemists about the effect of reaction apparatus.

Scheme 1 Pt/C–Fe-Catalyzed Arene Reduction in 2-Propanol as a Solvent
and Hydrogen Source
2 Results and Discussion
n-Heptylbenzene (1a, 0.5 mmol) could
not be catalytically reduced by 3 h of heating at 100 °C in a
sealed glass tube containing Pt/C, 2-PrOH (4 mL), and H2O (2 mL) (Table 1,
entry 1). On the other hand, this reduction proceeded in the presence
of the zero-valent Fe (5 mol %) as a main component of stainless steel
to produce the corresponding cyclohexane derivative (2a) in excellent isolated yield (98%). The above reduction also proceeded
in the presence of Zn and Co as co-catalysts, although lower conversions
were obtained (entries 3 and 4). The use of Ni and Cr as other major
stainless steel components was ineffective, as was the case for Cu,
Al, and Mg (entry 5). Although 2a could be obtained in
the presence of iron oxides (FeO and Fe2O3)
in moderate yields (entries 6 and 7, respectively), these reductions
were incomplete within 3 h. Heterogeneous platinum-group metal catalysts
other than Pt/C (e.g., Pd/C and Rh/C) were ineffective for the above
reduction even in the presence of Fe (entries 8 and 9), and no conversion
was observed when Fe was used as the only catalyst (entry 10). The
deference of reactivity of Pt/C, Pd/C, or Rh/C cannot be explained.
Furthermore, the reduction efficiency decreased with decreasing reaction
temperature (entry 11, 80 °C), and no reduction was observed
at 50 °C (entry 12). Notably, gram-scale reduction of 1a (1.3 g, 7.4 mmol) afforded 2a in 97% isolated yield
(entry 13).

The above reduction could be carried out in a 2-PrOH (4 mL)–H2O mixture7a (Table 1, entry 2; Table 2, entry 1), which allowed one to decrease
the risk posed by the pyrophoric nature of Pt/C. While the arene reduction
was also completely performed using 3 mL of 2-PrOH, further decrease
of 2-PrOH usage to 2 mL caused the incomplete reduction within 3 h
(see the Supporting Information). On the
other hand, the reduction was completely inhibited by the use of 1-PrOH
or t-BuOH as co-solvents (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). Furthermore, pure H2O could not be employed as a hydrogen source (entry 4). Importantly,
reduction in the 2-PrOH–H2O mixture was more effective
than reduction in pure H2O under H2 atmosphere
(entry 5).

The arene nuclei of cyclohexylbenzene (1b), t-butylbenzene (1c), and acetanilide
(1d) effectively underwent Pt/C–Fe-catalyzed reduction
in 2-PrOH/H2O to produce the corresponding cyclohexane
derivatives (2b–2d, Scheme 2). Anthracene (1e) was partially reduced to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydroanthracene (2e) in good yield. Toluene (1f) could be smoothly
transformed to methylcyclohexane (2f), which is viewed
as a promising hydrogen storage material for creating a hydrogen society,2 without the external addition of hydrogen. In
all cases, substrates (1b–1f) were
completely reduced without any byproduct formation.

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope of
the Reduction Reaction
10% Pt/C (10 mol %) and Fe0 (10 mol %) were used.

Although the
Pt/C–Fe-catalyzed reduction of stilbene (3) hardly
proceeded in 2-PrOH/H2O at 25 or 40 °C
(Table 3, entries 1
and 2, respectively), the olefin functionality of 3 was
selectively reduced at 60 °C without the reduction of arene nuclei
to produce 1,2-diphenylethane (4) in 98% isolated yield
(entry 3). However, olefin reduction was hardly catalyzed at 60 °C
by Pt/C in the absence of Fe (entry 4). On the other hand, both olefin
and arene functionalities of 3 were reduced in the presence
of Pt/C and Fe (5 mol % each) at 100 °C (12 h) to afford 1,2-dicyclohexylethane
(5) in quantitative yield (entry 5). 7-Tetradecene (6), bearing no aromatic nucleus within the molecule, also
efficiently underwent Pt/C–Fe-catalyzed reduction of the olefin
functionality at 60 °C to give tetradecane (7) in
88% yield, while 11% of 6 was recovered (Scheme 3). Complete reduction was observed
at 100 °C, furnishing 7 in 97% isolated yield. Meanwhile,
in the absence of Fe powder, 6 was completely recovered
at 60 and 100 °C.

Subsequently, we compared the hydrogenation
activities of Pt/C–Fe,
Pt/C, and Fe in 1-PrOH (poor hydrogen source; Table 2, entry 2) and H2O at 100 °C
under H2 (1 atm, 1 h; Scheme 4). In the case of Pt/C–Fe (5 mol %
Pt and Fe each), 11% of 1a was reduced, and 89% of 1a was recovered, whereas 2a was obtained in
17% yield when Pt/C was used on its own, and no hydrogenation was
observed when Fe was employed on its own. These results indicated
that under the conditions of the Pt/C–Fe-catalyzed reaction,
Fe does not facilitate Pt/C-catalyzed hydrogenation, with H2 gas generated in situ by the Pt/C-catalyzed dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH
(Table 1, entry 2).
Thus, as has previously been reported,11 the accelerating effect of combining Pt and Fe on hydrogenation
was not observed in the present arene reduction.

Scheme 4 Comparison of Pt/C–Fe,
Pt/C, and Fe Hydrogenation Activities
Figure 1 shows the
time profiles of the internal pressure in a 50 mL sealed glass tube
containing 2-PrOH/H2O at 100 °C under various conditions,
and Table 4 lists the
total yields of the in situ generated H2 determined by
gas chromatography thermal conductivity detection (GC–TCD).
The reduction of 1a (0.5 mmol) in 2-PrOH (4 mL)–H2O (2 mL) in the presence of 10% Pt/C (5 mol %: 0.025 mmol)
and Fe (5 mol %: 0.025 mmol) at 100 °C was complete within 3
h (Table 1, entry 2).
The internal pressure after 3 h reached ∼2 atm, and no further
increase was observed after the completion of arene reduction (Figure 1, conditions A),
with the yield of H2 after 6 h equaling only 0.33 mmol
(Table 4, entry 1).
Heating of the 2-PrOH-H2O mixture only resulted in a slight
increase of the internal pressure up to ∼2 atm due to simple
vaporization and thermal expansion of the fluid and gas (air) (conditions
B). These results indicated that the developed arene reduction could
safely proceed without the generation of excessive amounts of high-pressure
flammable H2 gas. Since Fe did not catalyze H2 generation in 2-PrOH/H2O (conditions C), H2 generation by corrosion (oxidation) of Fe in the aqueous solution
was ruled out.14 The simple use of Pt/C
in 2-PrOH/H2O resulted in the generation of a massive amount
of propane (116.2 mmol) by Pt/C-catalyzed hydrodeoxygenation,15 while only traces of H2 were concomitantly
produced (conditions D). On the other hand, the generation of propane
could be suppressed by the use of Fe powder along with Pt/C (conditions
E). Furthermore, the addition of 1a to the solvent mixture
containing Pt/C but no Fe powder suppressed the generation of C3H8 and H2, while no reduction of the
aromatic nucleus was observed (conditions F). Probably, Pt metal was
strongly coordinated by arene nuclei, which inhibited the Pt/C-catalyzed
dehydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of 2-PrOH.

To elucidate the mechanism of arene
reduction, the mean valence
of Fe in reaction mixtures was analyzed by XANES. As noted in the
Introduction section, the Pt/C-catalyzed reduction of 1a proceeded only in a stainless steel vessel, while the addition of
Fe (5 mol %) allowed this reduction to be performed in a glass tube. Figure 2 shows the X-ray
fluorescence profiles of the reaction mixtures A and B (Scheme 1) after 3 h of heating, revealing
that these mixtures contained 4.4 and 5.0 mmol Fe, respectively, as
determined from the peak integral values. These findings clearly confirmed
the leaching of Fe from stainless steel during the reaction.

Figure 2 X-ray fluorescence
profiles of the mixtures A and B (see Scheme 1).

The valences of Fe and Pt in the mixtures A and B after reduction
were determined from Fe K-edge (Figure 3) and Pt LIII-edge (Figure 4) XANES spectra of these mixtures using Fe0 powder, Pt0 foil, FeCl3, and PtCl4 as standards (detailed descriptions are provided in the Supporting Information). Compared with each energy
based on the absorption edge energy shift (normalized absorbance =
0.5 in Figure 3a),
the Fe K-edge absorptions of the samples A and B were shifted to higher
energies than that of the zero-valent Fe,16 and the mean valence of Fe in these samples was estimated as 1.57
and 1.50, respectively (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 (a) Normalized Fe K-edge XANES profiles. (b) Plot of Fe K-edge
absorption edge energy shift vs the valence of Fe. Reaction conditions
A and B are described in Scheme 1.

Figure 4 (a) Normalized Pt LIII-edge XANES profiles. (b) Plot
of Pt LIII-edge absorption edge energy shift vs the valence

X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and polarized neutron
reflectivity
(PNR) analyses also strongly supported the generation of oxidized
Fe ions during the reduction (see the Supporting Information). Similarly, the analysis of Pt LIII-edge XANES spectra (Figure 4a) in comparison with the absorption peak energy (absorbance
= 0.5)17 revealed that the absorption peaks
of the samples A and B shifted to higher energies (i.e., to higher
oxidation states) than that of zero-valent Pt metal (Figure 4b).18 As a result, the valence of Pt in both A and B samples after reduction
was determined to be 1.51 and 1.32, respectively, which indicated
that both A and B reactions were triggered by electron transfer from
Pt and Fe metals to the aromatic ring to form partially oxidized Pt
and Fe ions.

Two reaction mechanisms were proposed based on
these findings (Scheme 5). First, the Pt/C-catalyzed
dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH produces H2, which can be consumed
in the traditional Pt/C-catalyzed arene (1) hydrogenation3 and acetone (route a). In situ generated H2 rapidly reacts with acetone to afford 2-PrOH, which suppresses
the accumulation of excess H2 in the vessel. Although the
role of Fe is unclear, its addition promotes the dehydrogenation of
2-PrOH (Table 4, conditions
A vs F) and suppresses the hydrodeoxygenation of 2-PrOH to propane,
precluding the consumption of H2 required for arene hydrogenation
(Table 4, conditions
D vs E). As shown in Table 2, entries 2 and 3, arene reduction cannot be achieved when
2-PrOH is substituted for 1-PrOH or t-BuOH. This
behavior is ascribed to the fact that Pt-group metal/C-catalyzed dehydrogenation
of primary alcohols is accompanied by several side reactions such
as decarbonylation of intermediate aldehyde derivatives,7b which can retard arene reduction, while tertiary
alcohols without α-protons cannot act as H2 sources.
Therefore, Pt/C–Fe-catalyzed arene reduction effectively proceeds
only in 2-PrOH.

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanisms or Pt/C–Fe-Catalyzed Arene
Reduction
Alternatively, arene
reduction can take place via single electron
transfer (SET) analogously to the Birch reduction (route b). SET from
zero-valent Pt metal18 to the arene nucleus
of the charge transfer complex (A) formed from 1, and Pt/C gives a radical anion intermediate (B) that is immediately protonated by 2-PrOH or H2O to form C. The subsequent second SET and protonation afford a 1,3-cyclohexadiene
intermediate (E) complexed by PtII. PtII smoothly accepts electrons from Fe0 to regenerate
Pt0 (F) and produce FeII, which
is immediately reduced to Fe0 by H2 generated
via Pt/C-catalyzed dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH (route a). Repetition
of SET and protonation processes afford cyclohexane product 2 and regenerated Pt0 (catalytic cycle 1). The
PtI intermediate C can also be reduced to
Pt0 by Fe0 to produce intermediate G and FeI. Subsequent SET within G and the
protonation of anion intermediate H furnishes a diene–PtI complex (I). PtI can then be reduced
by FeI to generate a diene–Pt0 complex J (catalytic cycle-2), and the resulting FeII species
are reduced to Fe0 by H2 derived from 2-PrOH.
The mean valence of Pt (1.32 and 1.51) determined by XANES analysis
supports the operation of catalytic cycle 1, which involves redox
shuttling between Pt0 and PtII. The release
of PtII from complex E in the absence of catalytic
Fe powder should afford traces of diene intermediate K. Notably, 1a was completely recovered under the conditions
of Pt/C catalysis in the absence of Fe (Table 1, entry 1). On the other hand, unsaturated
cyclohexane derivatives such as cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene easily
undergo Pt-group metal-catalyzed dehydrogenative aromatization in
H2O to form the corresponding benzene derivatives.8a Therefore, diene intermediate K might be immediately transformed to 1 via Pt-catalyzed
dehydrogenation. Indeed, a mixture of toluene (8; 0.95
mmol) and 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene (9; 0.05 mmol)
as a model of the corresponding diene intermediate (K) was smoothly converted to toluene (8; 0.99 mmol) as
the sole product via the dehydrogenation of K under conditions
of 2-PrOH-free aqueous Pt/C catalysis in both the presence and absence
of Fe (Scheme 6).19 K2PtCl4 and PtO2 also catalyzed the dehydrogenation of 9, which resulted
in the formation of 8. Furthermore, the use of 1-PrOH
or t-BuOH instead of 2-PrOH should afford diene intermediates
equivalent to K, since in these cases, Fe0 cannot be regenerated from FeII because of the poor (or
absence of) H2 generation ability of these alcohols. The
regeneration of 1 from K also causes the
complete recovery of 1 when 1-PrOH and t-BuOH are used as solvents (Table 2, entries 2 and 3). Meanwhile, the (Pt/C (5 mol %)
+ 2-PrOH)-mediated reduction of the olefin functionality of stilbene
(3) in the absence of Fe proceeded to an insignificant
extent to produce 1,2-diphenylethane (4, 3% yield) via
the SET mechanism not involving redox shuttling between PtI/PtII and Pt0 (Table 3, entry 4). This finding was ascribed to
the fact that the dehydrogenation of the saturated ethylene function
of 4 to 3 was not catalyzed by Pt/C in H2O (Scheme 7). The consecutive generation of appropriate quantities of H2 via Pt/C–Fe-catalyzed dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH for
the regeneration of Fe0 from FeII was required
to maintain the catalytic cycle for effective arene reduction, although
a FeI, FeII, and FeIII cycle for
the repeatable regeneration of Pt0 cannot be ruled out.

Scheme 6 Pt-Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Regeneration of Toluene (8) from Cyclohexadiene Derivative 9
Scheme 7 Results of 1,2-Diphenylethane (4) Reduction
under the
Conditions of Pt/C Catalysis
Route b seems to be preferred over route a, since (a)
reduction
with 2-PrOH as a hydrogen source is faster than that with excess amount
of H2 gas (Table 2, entry 1 vs 5) and (b) a small amount of H2 is
generated by the use of Pt/C and Fe in 2-PrOH/H2O (Table 4, entry 5). Whereas
the traditional Birch reduction of arenes by stoichiometric amounts
of Na in liquid NH3 gives 1,4-cyclohexadienes via SET followed
by protonation, the present reduction method directly affords cyclohexane
derivatives.20

The H–D exchange
reaction of acetanilide (1d) could proceed in the presence
of Pt/C in a 2-PrOH and D2O-mixed solvent without arene
reduction to give the deuterated acetanilide
(1da-dn) (Scheme 8, top).13a Under the present arene reduction
conditions using Pt/C and Fe as catalysts in D2O instead
of H2O, both H–D exchange reaction and arene reduction
were carried out to give the deuterium-labeled cyclohexane derivatives
(2db-dn) with moderate D content (middle). Meanwhile, the use of 2-PrOD-d8 instead of 2-PrOH reduced the reaction efficiencies
of both arene reduction and H–D exchange reaction (bottom).
Probably, the Pt/C-catalyzed dehydrogenation of 2-PrOD-d8 was suppressed due to the isotopic effect causing a
stronger C–D bond at the α-position of 2-PrOD-d8, and the enough amount of deuterium, which
is essential to regenerate the zero-valent catalyst (Scheme 5), was not produced. The low
D contents of 2dc-dn indicated that the protonation (Scheme 5) is mainly derived from water.
The similar Pt/C-catalyzed reaction conditions using 2-PrOH and D2O may induce the H–D exchange reaction of hydrocarbon,
such as cyclohexane moiety.13d Namely,
the effect using deuterated solvents cannot be clearly explained,
since three reactions (H–D exchange reactions of arene and
hydrocarbon and arene reduction) can proceed under Pt/C- and Fe-catalyzed
reaction conditions. At least, it is certain that the additional Fe
is required to facilitate the desired Pt/C-catalyzed arene reduction
using 2-PrOH.

3 Conclusions
Pt/C–Fe-catalyzed
arene reduction with 2-PrOH as a hydrogen
source under ambient-pressure conditions was developed. The Pt/C-catalyzed
in situ production of H2 via the dehydrogenation of 2-PrOH
was shown to play a critical role in the regeneration of the composite
catalyst to promote arene reduction. Since only small amounts of H2 accumulated in the reaction vessel after reduction, the present
method was concluded to be useful from the viewpoint of safety. The
presence of a catalytic amount of Fe was found to be crucial for the
external hydrogen-free reduction of aromatic nuclei in aqueous 2-PrOH.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Information
Ten percent Pt/C,
Pd/C, Rh/C, and Ru/C were supplied by the N. E. Chemcat Corporation
(Tokyo, Japan). 1-PrOH, 2-PrOH, t-BuOH, and water
were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification.
All of the commercially available reagents were used without further
purification. Reactions were carried out in 50 mL glass sealed tube
[tinyclave steel (Büchiglasuster, Switzerland)] or 15 ×
150 m/m test tube. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL
ECZ 400 or ECA 500 spectrometer at room temperature in CDCl3 as a solvent and internal standard (1H NMR: δ =
7.26 for CDCl3) with tetramethylsilane as a further internal
standard. A JMS Q1000 GC [7890A gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies,
USA) equipped with a JEOL MK II mass spectrometer (JEOL Co., Ltd.,
Japan)] and an Inert Cap5MS/sil capillary column (30 × 0.25 mm
i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness; GL Science, Japan) were used for
toluene and methylcyclohexane analyses. GC-3200 [gas chromatography
equipped with thermal conductivity detector (GC/TCD; GL Science, Japan)]
was used for gas analysis with Molecular Sieve 5 Å (60/80 mesh)
packed column (3 × 2.2 mm i.d., 1/8 inch: GL Science, Japan)
for H2 analysis, Porapak Q (80/100 mesh) packed column
(2 × 2.2 mm i.d., 1/8 inch: GL Science, Japan) for C3H8 analysis. EXAFS measurements of solutions were performed
using the fluorescence mode at the BL11S2 Hard X-ray EXAFS beamline
station in the Aichi SR. The incident X-rays were monitored by an
ionization chamber (14 cm in length) filled with N2 gas.

4.2 General Procedure for Arene Reduction (Tables 1–3; Schemes 2 and 3)
4.2.1 Reduction of n-Heptylbenzene,
Cyclohexylbenzene, tert-Butylbenzene, or Anthracene
A 50 mL sealed glass tube was sequentially charged with arene (0.50
mmol), Fe0 (1.4 mg, 0.025 mmol, 5 mol %), 10% Pt/C (48.8
mg, 0.025 mmol, 5 mol %), H2O (2 mL), and 2-PrOH (4 mL),
and the suspension was stirred at 100 °C (Caution: the addition of 2-PrOH in the absence of H2O causes
the ignition of Pt/C). After stirring for a specific reaction time,
the mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a
membrane filter (Millipore, Millex-LH, 0.2 μm) to remove catalysts.
The filtrate was extracted with Et2O (20 mL) diluted with
H2O (20 mL), and the aqueous layer was further extracted
with Et2O (3 × 10 mL). The organic layer was dried
over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo
to give the cyclohexane product.

4.2.2 Reduction
of Toluene
A 50 mL sealed
glass tube was sequentially charged with toluene (1f;
46.1 mg, 0.50 mmol), Fe0 (2.8 g, 0.050 mmol, 10 mol %),
10% Pt/C (97.6 g, 0.050 mmol, 10 mol %), H2O (2 mL), and
2-PrOH (4 mL), and the suspension was stirred at 100 °C (Caution: the addition of 2-PrOH in the absence of H2O causes the ignition of Pt/C). After stirring for 3 h, the
mixture was cooled to room temperature and anisole added (50 μL)
as an internal standard. The mixture was filtered through a membrane
filter (Millipore, Millex-LH, 0.2 μm) to remove catalysts. The
filtrate was transferred to a 50 mL volumetric flask with Et2O. Twenty microliters of the sample was dissolve in 1.5 mL of Et2O. 2f was determined by GC-MS and yield was 82%.
Helium was employed as a carrier gas at the flow rate of 1.3 mL/min.
The injector and detector temperatures were 280 °C. The column
temperature was programmed to ramp from 35 °C (1 min hold) to
110 °C (3 min hold) at the rate of 5 °C/min and then to
280 °C (1.5 min hold) at the rate of 30 °C/min. One microliter
of the sample solution was injected (split; 1:10). The products were
identified by their GC/MS retention times in comparison to those of
authentic commercial samples. Retention times (min) were 3.53 (methylcyclohexane),
4.14 (toluene), and 8.40 (internal standard) (Anisole).

4.2.3 Reduction of Stilbene and 7-Tetradecene

mg, 0.013 mmol, 5 mol %), 10% Pt/C (24.4 mg, 0.013 mmol,
5 mol %), H2O (1 mL), and 2-PrOH (2 mL), and the suspension
was stirred at 100 °C (Caution: the addition
of 2-PrOH in the absence of H2O causes the ignition of
Pt/C). After stirring for a specific reaction time, the mixture was
cooled to room temperature and filtered through a membrane filter
(Millipore, Millex-LH, 0.2 μm) to remove the catalysts. The
filtrate was extracted with Et2O (20 mL), diluted with
H2O (20 mL), and the aqueous layer was further extracted
with Et2O (3 × 10 mL). The organic layer was dried
over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo
to give the alkane product.

mmol, 5 mol %), 10% Pt/C (48.8 mg, 0.025 mmol, 5 mol %), H2O (2 mL), and 2-PrOH (4 mL), and the suspension was stirred at 100
°C. Pressure gauge on the glass sealed tube was checked at 5,
10, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h. After 6 h, the mixture was cooled
to room temperature and the amounts of H2 and C3H8 were detected from the analysis of the headspace gas
by GC/TCD. Helium was employed as a carrier gas at 220 kPa (molecular
sieve 5 Å) and 140 kPa (Porapak Q). The injector and detector
temperatures were 100 °C. The column temperature was programmed
to 70 °C. One milliliter of sample gas was injected. The products
were identified by their GC/TCD retention times in comparison to those
of authentic commercial samples. Retention times (min) were 1.3 (H2, Molecular Sieve 5 Å) and 13.7 (C3H8, Porapack Q).
