Nanomaterials
that
comprise titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles have received
much attention owing to their wide applications; presently, the green
synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles is a developing research
area. In this study, the TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized
through a DC-pulsed discharge plasma over an aqueous solution surface
under a high-pressure argon environment. The titanium-rod electrode
was utilized as the material source for the TiO2 nanoparticle
generation. Experiments were performed at room temperature with pressurized
argon at 1–4 MPa. To generate a pulse electrical discharge
plasma, a DC power supply of 18.6 kV was applied. The Raman spectroscopy
showed that the TiO2 nanoparticle with a brookite structure
was formed dominantly. The scanning transmission electron microscopy
equipped with energy dispersion spectroscopy (STEM coupled with EDS)
indicated that TiO2 coated with carbon and that without
carbon coating were successfully produced at the nanoscale. The process
presented here is an innovative process and can update the existing
information regarding the synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles using
pulsed discharge plasma under an argon environment.

Introduction
Nanomaterials comprising metal-based
nanoparticles have been applied in various industrial applications1−4 such
as chemical industry, food industry, cosmetics, medicine, and electronics
owing to their physicochemical properties (electrical, magnetic, optical,
etc.). Nanoscale materials also demonstrate high surface energy, quantum
confinement, and a very large specific surface area. TiO2 nanoparticles, as metal oxide particles, are defined as particles
of TiO2 having diameters less than 100 nm. This metal-oxide
nanoparticle was also named nanocrystalline TiO2, ultrafine
TiO2, or microcrystalline TiO2. Titanium dioxide
can be found abundantly in the Earth’s crust and possesses
unique physical and chemical properties. Hence, it can have various
applications such as pigments in paints, sensors, medical implants,
cosmetics, and ultraviolet (UV) sunscreens. This material is also
conventionally applied in smart windows, catalysis, photovoltaics,
optoelectronics, batteries, fuel cells, and antifogging and self-cleaning
surfaces.5−8

As metal-based nanoparticles may have a broad
range of applications in various science and technology fields, diverse
methods such as biological, physical, and chemical methods have been
proposed and designed for their production, including TiO2 nanoparticle production.9,10 Physical method tends
to focus on metal-based nanoparticle synthesis via the reduction of
the material’s size (top-down approach), while the chemical
and biological methods are focused on generating metal-based nanoparticles
via atomic or molecular constructions (bottom-up approach). Various
chemical synthesis methods have been used to produce metal-based nanoparticles
in large amounts within a short time period, with a good adjustment
in the size distribution. It is a simple and easy method to perform
but, in the majority of cases, employs a toxic reagent or solvent
for producing various morphologies of metal-based nanoparticles. Consequently,
this method may produce contaminants and hazardous residues. In contrast,
the physical synthesis methods did not comprise organic solvent contamination.
Hence, this method is more advantageous than the chemical synthesis
method in terms of avoiding organic solvent contamination. This method
also facilitates a higher production yield owing to its comparatively
fast process. The physical synthesis method may avoid the production
of toxic chemicals and allow uniformity in the metal-based nanoparticle
distribution. However, the physical synthesis method has a high production
cost and provides a poor quality and smaller quantity of metal-based
nanoparticles as compared to the chemical synthesis method. As a bottom-up
approach, the biological synthesis method is an inexpensive and environmentally
friendly method for metal-based nanoparticle synthesis. However, the
existence of unwanted biological contaminants and restricted reproducibility
are the main drawbacks of this method.9,10

It is
known that electrical discharge plasma in liquids or in gas–liquid
media, and especially water, can be used for many applications such
as material (nanoparticles) synthesis, chemical synthesis, chemical
liquid-solution analysis, decomposition of chemicals in pollution
control, biomedical or biological treatment, and polymer processing,
as this technique comprises a simple, versatile, and robust process.11−13 Herein, pulsed electrical discharge
plasma generated over an aqueous solution surface was employed as
a media for metal-based nanoparticles’ synthesis from titanium
metal. The novelty of this work lies in the method of the particle
generation from titanium metal rod, which can avoid unwanted contaminants.

Results
and Discussion
When the
electrical discharge plasma is applied over the surface of an aqueous
solution or in the aqueous solution, physical and chemical processes
may occur, such as the generation of active species (active molecules
and radicals).14−17 The active species include oxygen, hydrogen,
hydroperoxyl radicals (oxidative species) and hydrogen radicals (reductive
species), aqueous electrons, and superoxide radical anions. As the
electrical discharge plasma produced active species in the gas environment
near the aqueous solution surface, these active species could dissolve
into the aqueous solution to generate hydrogen peroxide. The reductive
species then become an important factor in the reduction reaction
of metal ions into metal nanoparticles, while the oxidative species
are the key factors for the oxidation reaction of transition metals.12,16,18 Owing to this phenomenon, the
use of the electrical discharge plasma process over an aqueous solution
surface to synthesize metal-based nanoparticles from titanium metal
is an effective method. Figure 1 presents a photograph of the collected aqueous solution products
obtained after pulsed discharge plasma at 20 000 pulses at
various operating pressures. It is apparent that the collected aqueous
solution products underwent a color change from transparent (colorless)
to dark (black). Interestingly, this phenomenon was observed only
when the experiments were performed at high argon pressure conditions
of more than 1 MPa. At these conditions, the pulsed discharge plasma
may occur in the environment and result in individual effects such
as intense ultraviolet radiation, generation of various radicals,
strong electrical field, and an overpressure shock wave.14−16,19

solution products obtained after treatment by pulsed discharge plasma
under an argon environment (a) room temperature (0.1 MPa) and (b)
1.0 MPa, (c) 2.0 MPa, (d) 3.0 MPa, and (e) 4.0 MPa.

In this work, the discharge plasma was directly introduced
and contacted
over the aqueous solution surface where the propagation of the streamer
channel may occur to promote various chemical and physical processes.
The reactive chemical species such as radicals (OH, H, O, and HO2) and molecular species (H2O2, HO2, and O2) may react and cleave the glycine structures
containing a carboxyl group (−COOH, C=O, and −OH
functional group) and an amine group (−NH2). The
increasing environmental pressures may promote a shorter radiation
pulse and a larger number of diffusive cones for generating discharge
while applying the electrical discharge plasma at the surface of the
aqueous solution containing glycine;14,20 the decomposition
reaction rate of glycine in generating carbon materials also increases
as the operating pressures increase. Although the reason for this
is still unclear, it explains why carbon materials were generated
only under high operating pressure. As a result, the collected aqueous
solution products became darker as the operating pressures increased.
Wahyudiono et al. reported that the decomposition reaction of the
chemical compound increased on increasing the operating pressures
when they applied the pulsed discharge plasma over an aqueous solution
surface containing pyrrole.14 They reported
that a high voltage was required for realizing the breakdown voltage
for the gas at the higher-pressure conditions to generate an electric
field, and an increase in the applied voltage may increase the electric
field intensity of an aqueous solution. The electrons within the area
have more energy and bombarded the aqueous solution containing pyrrole
at a higher speed. A similar phenomenon was also observed when Hayashi
et al. performed experiments to produce carbon materials from an aqueous
solution containing amino acids by applying electrical discharge plasma
under pressurized argon gas.21,22 They reported that
a
larger amount of reactive species was transformed into the aqueous
solution during the application of the pulsed discharge plasma at
higher-pressure conditions, which resulted in the generation of carbon
materials from amino acids.

To separate the remaining unreacted
glycine from the collected aqueous solution product, it was dialyzed
using a dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por3, Spectrum Laboratories Inc.,
California). The pore size of the membrane was approximately 5 nm.
The collected aqueous solution product was then analyzed using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer. This type of analysis is generally the first technique
employed for detecting the generation and existence of metal nanoparticles,
including titanium, owing to the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance. Figure 2 presents the UV–vis
spectra of the collected aqueous solution products after treatment
with pulsed discharge plasma under argon atmospheric pressure and
pressurized argon gas (0.1, 2, and 4 MPa). It shows that the absorption
between 200 and 300 nm was found to be strong under all the considered
conditions of pressurized argon gas and especially at 4 MPa. These
absorption peaks were probably caused by titanium oxide nanoparticles23−25 that were generated from the
titanium-rod electrode consumption during the pulsed discharge experiments.12,26−30

under an argon environment.

Kolikov
et al. performed the experiments with pulsed electrical discharge
plasma as a disinfection
in the treatment of the wastewater from the sewerage from hospitals
and industries.26 They reported that the
metal electrode underwent erosion owing to the pulsed electrical discharge
plasma in an aqueous solution, which resulted in the generation of
metal nanoparticles in the aqueous media. Saito and Akiyama reviewed
the formation of metal nanoparticles using electrical discharge plasma
in liquid media.12 They concluded that
the solid metals introduced into the liquid media not only act as
electrodes but also as metal-ion source materials for generating metal
nanoparticles. Recently, Kim and Kim confirmed that the application
of electrical discharge plasma in liquid media is a simple, versatile,
and environment-friendly method for generating metal nanoparticles.30 Based on these researches, it could be stated
that TiO2 nanoparticles have been successfully produced
by the application of pulsed electrical discharge plasma over an aqueous
solution containing glycine via the titanium-electrode erosion under
pressurized argon gas.

To understand the generation of TiO2 nanoparticles, the collected particle products were observed
using scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (STEM coupled with EDS) apparatus. This tool is simple
and facilitates the identification of the elements present in the
collected particle products. Figure 3 presents the TEM image and the elemental composition
of the TiO2 nanoparticles when the pulsed electrical discharge
plasma was applied at an argon pressure of 3 MPa. The color coding
of the elements in Figure 3b–d is as follows: titanium (b), oxygen (c), oxygen–titanium
(d), carbon (e), and carbon–titanium (f). These images show
the presence and distribution of titanium, oxygen, and carbon. In
general, the electrode erosion caused by the electrical discharge
plasma is an unwanted phenomenon and hence this phenomenon should
be prevented in the application of pulsed discharge plasma over or
in liquid solution media. However, as mentioned previously, in this
work, the titanium-rod electrode erosion phenomenon was used as a
material source for nanoparticle generation, and this titanium-rod
electrode was placed over an aqueous solution containing glycine to
generate electrical discharge plasma. Thus, the electrode erosion
status is shifted from an unwanted product (contaminant) to the desired
process products. It is widely accepted that pulsed discharge plasma
in contact with an aqueous solution medium may initiate chemical and
physical processes involving the generation of active species (molecules
and radicals) and UV radiation and shock-wave generation. Hence, the
potential decomposition of the glycine compound may occur during the
pulsed discharge plasma application on the aqueous solution media.

image of TiO2 nanoparticles (a) with the corresponding
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps for titanium (b), oxygen
(c), oxygen–titanium (d), carbon (e), and carbon–titanium
(f) elements.

Even Parkansky et al. reported
that eroded particles from titanium-rod
electrodes during the application of electrical discharge plasma could
enhance the decomposition of methylene blue in aqueous solution media.31 They explained that the decomposition rate of
methylene blue was encouraged by the interaction of hydrogen peroxide
with the particle surface to form titanium peroxide. As shown in Figure 3, oxygen and carbon
were found in the collected TiO2 particle products and
appeared to be attached to the TiO2 nanoparticle surface.
These elements may have originated from the glycine molecule via its
decomposition reaction during the pulsed discharge plasma application.21,22 It should be noted that owing to the reduction of the titanium-rod
electrode, the distance between the titanium-rod electrode tip and
the aqueous solution media may perhaps change, which may affect the
distribution of the electric field and, thus, the distribution of
the charge; therefore, the overall electrical discharge plasma was
not investigated.

In this work, using ImageJ software, the particle-size
distribution of the collected particle products was determined according
to the TEM images. At least 300 images of different particles were
randomly selected for each experimental condition. As shown in Figure 4, it was discovered
that the sizes of the collected particle products were less than 100
nm. The average size of the collected particle products was approximately
50.61, 21.38, 12.24, and 7.8 nm when the experiments were performed
at argon pressures of 1, 2, 3, and 4 MPa, respectively. It was observed
that the increase in the operating pressures resulted in a decrease
in the size and the narrowing of the distribution of the collected
particle products. It was already known that increasing the operating
pressure in the pulsed discharge plasma system would result in an
increase in the applied bias voltage to generate the plasma.14,32 Saito et al. reported that the excitation temperature increased
as the applied bias voltage was increased for various electrolyte
concentrations in the plasma system.33 They
concluded that the higher applied voltage in the plasma system was
effective in synthesizing small metal nanoparticles owing to the high
excitation temperature. However, they also explained that the metal
nanoparticle generation in the plasma system was also affected by
the physical properties of the electrode material, such as its chemical
stability, electrical conductivity, density, thermal conductivity,
ionization energy, vapor pressure, and melting temperature. Wahyudiono
et al. reported that, as the operating pressure increased, the wavelength
of the pulsed discharge plasma radiation decreased, and the pulsed
discharge plasma was generated by a large number of diffusive cones.14 An increase in the number of bright spots on
the cathode is also observed, and these spots may be distributed uniformly
over the cathode ring edges. Consequently, the species, including
particles, that were ejected from the metal electrode during the pulsed
discharge plasma application underwent a rapid decrease in temperature
to avoid the growth of the particles.

Figure 4 Particle-size
distributions of the collected particle products at various operating
pressures.

The collected TiO2 particle
products were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy.
This analysis was performed to understand the distinct chemical fingerprint
that can provide information regarding the chemical bonds conjugated
with the diverse molecules present in the materials, including TiO2 particles, which are generated by the pulsed discharge plasma
in the aqueous solution containing the glycine compound. This is a
noncontact, nondestructive, convenient, and powerful technique that
also requires pretreatments of the specimen and can be applied to
a variety of materials. Figure 5 shows the typical Raman spectroscopy plot for the vibrational
properties of the TiO2 particles. Several phenomena were
observed when the Raman spectroscopy analysis was used for the characterization
of the TiO2 nanoparticles. These phenomena include the
symmetric stretching vibration of O–Ti–O in TiO2, which results in the Eg peak; symmetric bending
vibration of O–Ti–O, which results in the B1g peak; and antisymmetric bending vibration of O–Ti–O,
which results in the A1g peak.34−37 As shown in Figure 5a, strong Raman peaks
were clearly observed at 150, 212, and 502 cm–1.
These Raman bands can be associated with Raman active modes of the
brookite structural phase with the symmetries of Eg for
the 150 cm–1 band and B1g for the 212
and 502 cm–1 bands.35,36 Anitha et
al.
reviewed the recent developments in the synthesis, modification, properties,
and energy-related applications of TiO2 as n- and p-type
transparent semiconductors. They summarized that brookite TiO2 possesses several Raman active modes (nine A1g, nine B1g, nine B2g, and nine B3g), which are assigned as follows: A1g (127/128, 155/156,
194, 245/246, 412, and 637/638 cm–1), B1g (133, 213/214, 322/323, and 501/502 cm–1), B2g (365/366, 395/396, 460/461, and 583 cm–1), and B3g (172, 287/288, and 545 cm–1).35 It is well known that the applied
pulsed discharge plasma over an aqueous solution surface via a metal-rod
electrode may result in a gradual metal-electrode erosion. This phenomenon
may occur because the metal electrode was employed to realize the
constant bombardment of high-energy electrons for maintaining the
current that is transferred to the aqueous solution media. The material
ejection from the surface of a metal electrode occurs to generate
metal particles.26 In the case of titanium
as an electrode, it was employed as a material source for nanoparticle
generation, and it seemed that the TiO2 nanoparticles with
brookite structure were formed owing to the high-energy electrons
bombarding the aqueous solution containing the deposited TiO2 particles.38−40

Figure 5 Raman spectra
of TiO2 nanoparticles generated by pulsed discharge plasma
under argon environment at 3.0 MPa: (a) 100–700 cm–1 and (b) 750–4000 cm–1.

Srivatsa et al. reported the generation of brookite TiO2 particles under energetic ions impact.38 They explained that under high applied bias voltages, the dense
ions may provide sufficient energy to encourage the restructuring
of the deposited TiO2 particles. Furthermore, they explained
that, although the deposited TiO2 particles required a
certain amount of energy to realize a particular structure, for instance,
by raising the deposition temperature, the certain energetic condition
can be realized for the particular structure generation at room temperature
via the application of a bias voltage during the pulsed discharge
plasma process. When the Raman spectroscopy was applied at active
normal modes for the vibration of the organic molecules in the range
of 400–4000 cm–1, the Raman peaks with strong
intensity at 1346, 1578, and 2682 cm–1, which were
assigned to the D band, G band, and 2D band, respectively,41,42 were clearly observed (see Figure 5b). The G band provides information regarding the bond
stretching of the sp2 carbon atoms, while the D band provides
information regarding the breathing modes of the sp2 carbon
atoms. These two peaks are general for amorphous, noncrystalline,
and diverse disordered forms of carbons observed in the Raman spectroscopy.
This Raman spectrum indicated that the carbon materials were generated
from an aqueous solution containing glycine via the application of
pulsed discharge plasma under pressurized argon gas.21,22 This is an advantageous effect in terms of the generation of carbon
materials from an aqueous solution containing organic materials.

To obtain information regarding the atomic structure, the collected
TiO2 particle products were characterized using high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM). This tool makes use of the phase contrast that is generated
by the transmitted beam interference with at least one diffracted
beam to observe the information of the atomic structure in a sample.
Hence, the HRTEM image generally presented bright and dark zones associated
with at least two crystalline overlapping particles. Figure 6a,b shows the HRTEM images
of the TiO2 particles without and with carbon material,
respectively. This HRTEM image (see Figure 6a) showed that lattice fringes with an interplanar
spacing of 0.36–0.35 nm were clearly observed in the crystal
plane of the TiO2 particle products. This may correspond
to the crystal plane of the orthorhombic phase brookite TiO2 particle.43,44 It is well known that TiO2 particles exist primarily in three crystalline polymorphic
forms in nature: brookite (orthorhombic), rutile (tetragonal), and
anatase (tetragonal). Among these crystalline phases, the rutile particle
is the most stable form, whereas brookite and anatase particles are
metastable and can be transformed into rutile particles. Nevertheless,
Ge et al. reported that brookite and anatase particles are considered
to be more stable at the nanoscale owing to their lower surface energy.45 In addition, anatase and brookite particles
appear to have a similar lattice fringe-spacing range of approximately
0.35 nm, corresponding to the anatase (101) and brookite (210) plane
particles.46,47 Hence, it is difficult to distinguish
between
anatase and brookite particles owing to their similar lattice fringe
spacing ranges. However, in agreement with the results obtained via
Raman spectroscopy (see Figure 5), the collected TiO2 particle products appear
to comprise the brookite structure as the main TiO2 particle
products.38,39

Figure 6 HRTEM images
of TiO2 (a) and carbon–TiO2 (b).

As reported by previous researchers,
two phenomena are observed during the application of pulsed discharge
plasma over an aqueous solution containing organic material. They
include the decomposition reaction of organic materials that exist
in the aqueous solution14,21,22 and the degradation of an electrode, which may result in the generation
of metal particles at the nanoscale.12,26−30 Accordingly, the titanium and
carbon atoms generated owing to the titanium electrode erosion and
the glycine decomposition reaction during the application of pulsed
discharge plasma may interact to generate titanium carbide (TiC) nanoparticles.
As shown in Figure 6b, the HRTEM image reveals that lattice-fringe spacing of approximately
0.22–0.24 nm corresponding to the distance of the titanium
carbide (111) plane was observed in the collected TiO2 particle
products.48 Hence, it could be stated that,
during the application of the pulsed discharge plasma over an aqueous
solution containing glycine compound via a titanium-rod electrode,
there is a sufficient amount of carbon atoms to interact with the
titanium atom for generating titanium carbide nanoparticles.49 It should be noted that the concentrations of
titanium and carbon atoms, which may affect the formation reaction
of titanium carbide, were not determined.

It has been mentioned
above that the application of pulsed electrical discharge plasma in
the aqueous solution media can result in the generation of strong
electric fields that may result in a variety of physical and chemical
processes. The main chemical process can be reflected by the various
reactive-species generation in an aqueous solution media, while the
most important phenomenon in the physical process is the generation
of shockwaves and UV (ultraviolet) radiation. Although the physical
and chemical reactions during the application of pulsed electrical
discharge plasma in an aqueous solution media are complicated, these
two phenomena may promote the desirable chemical reaction and possess
the ability to decompose organic compounds including glycine.14,19 The existence of radical quenchers and electrolytes in the aqueous
solution media may also have an influence on the decomposition reaction
rate. In addition, the conductivity of the aqueous solution media
may also result in a reduction in the active-species generation and
affect the pulsed electrical discharge in an aqueous solution media;
conversely, it can promote a higher rate of UV radiation.14,50 The release of ions and particles owing to the metal-electrode erosion
into an aqueous solution media can also influence the chemical reactions.
Hence, these physical and chemical processes were expected and can
explain the glycine decomposition and the interaction between the
titanium particles and the glycine decomposition products during pulsed
discharge plasma application over a water surface under pressurized
argon gas.

The general plasma–chemical decomposition
mechanism of organic compounds in aqueous solution media was initiated
by the generation of chemically active species through the interaction
between the electrical discharge plasma with water as a medium. The
molecules of water underwent a dissociation reaction to form hydroxyl
and hydrogen radicals due to the collision between the water molecules
and the electrons that were generated in the aqueous solution media
during the application of pulsed electrical discharge plasma. In the
subsequent reactions, the electron collisions may result in diverse
radicals. Hence, reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide, oxygen,
and hydrogen were observed during the application of pulsed discharge
plasma, although the formation of the superoxide ion as a radical
reduction and that of the hydroxyl ion as radical oxidation are responsible
for the decomposition of the organic compounds. Moreover, the UV radiation
may also drive the dissociation reaction of hydrogen peroxide and
water, which can enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Thus,
it can be assumed that the two major reactions that occur during the
application of pulsed discharge plasma in the aqueous solution media
containing glycine comprise water dissociation and hydrogen peroxide
generation.14,17,51 1   2  The intense application of electrical
discharge
plasma in aqueous solution media may result in an increase in the
collision of high-energy electrons with molecules; hence, the dissociation
of water molecules more efficiently results in the formation of reactive
species. At the same time, the high-energy electrons and reactive
species also interact and attack the glycine molecules, which results
in its derived compounds. The hydroxyl radicals attack the membrane
glycine via hydrogen abstraction from α-carbon of peptide bonds −CO–NH–.
The reaction involved in this process is complex as, in principle,
every chemical compound may be generated via different reaction routes.
In this work, the intermediate compounds generated from the decomposition
reaction of glycine were not observed. Hence, the glycine decomposition
reaction was represented by the following overall reaction: glycine
+ hydroxyl radical → amides and carbonyls.11,52,53

In addition to the existence of titanium
ions generated from the titanium-rod electrode, erosion may affect
the aqueous solution properties, and thereafter, they are believed
to promote and contribute to the plasma formation over an aqueous
solution; these metal ions may also enhance the decomposition reaction
of glycine. This can be explained as follows. During the pulsed discharge
plasma application, a significant amount of UV light was generated,
which may affect the TiO2 particle products that were generally
considered as a catalyst in the photocatalytic processes. As a result,
the decomposition reaction of glycine in the aqueous solution progresses.
In this work, the plasma presence around the titanium-rod electrode,
as an anode, resulted in gradual erosion during the application of
the pulse voltage. The ejection of the titanium particles from the
titanium-rod electrode surface into the aqueous solution media containing
the glycine compound does not result in the TiO2 particle
generation. However, the existence of hydrogen peroxide, which is
oxygen rich, in the aqueous solution media may promote the generation
of TiO2 particles via the direct oxidation of titanium
particles.49,54−56 The titanium
particles also simultaneously interacted
with the carbon generated from the glycine decomposition reaction
to form titanium carbide. Furthermore, Haghighi and Poursalehi also
reported that titanium carbide can be generated by the reaction between
carbon and titanium dioxide under arc discharge plasma in a liquid
solution.49 Based on these results, it
could be stated that the application of pulsed discharge plasma via
a titanium-rod electrode over the aqueous solution media containing
the glycine compound may result in the production of titanium oxide
through an oxidation reaction and titanium carbide nanoparticles through
the interaction between titanium and its oxide particles with carbon,
which was generated through the decomposition reaction of glycine.
The simple plausible reaction mechanism for the generation of the
titanium carbide and titanium dioxide particles is as follows49 3   4   5   6  

Conclusions
TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully
synthesized by applying a DC-pulsed
discharge plasma over an aqueous solution surface under a high-pressure
argon environment. The titanium-rod electrode was employed as the
material source for the TiO2 nanoparticle generation. Experiments
were performed at room temperature under an argon environment (1–4
MPa). The DC power supply of 18.6 kV was applied to generate a pulsed
electrical discharge plasma. The UV–vis spectrophotometer indicated
that the absorption occurred between 200 and 300 nm, which originated
from the TiO2 nanoparticles in each collected sample. The
Raman spectroscopy showed that the TiO2 nanoparticle with
brookite structure was formed dominantly owing to the high-energy
electrons bombarding the aqueous solution containing the deposited
TiO2 particles. The STEM coupled with EDS indicated that
TiO2 with and without a carbon coating was produced at
the nanoscale. Finally, it can be stated that an innovative process
is presented herein that can be used to update the information regarding
the synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles via pulsed discharge plasma
under an argon environment.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
All the
chemicals were used as received without further purification. Glycine
(CAS. No. 56-40-6; Product No. 077-00735) and distilled water (CAS.
No. 7732-18-5; Product No. 049-16787) that were used as the aqueous
solution media were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd., Osaka, Japan. The glycine compound was selected based on previous
works.21,22 Argon (purity greater than 99.99%) was bought
from Sogo Kariya Sanso, Inc., Japan. The aqueous solution media were
prepared as follows. One hundred grams of glycine was dissolved in
1 L of distilled water and stirred (Rexim, RSH-1DR, AS ONE, Japan)
for approximately 30 min at room temperature. This aqueous solution
was then stored in a desiccator at room temperature. It should be
noted that other types of chemicals were not applied as solution media
during the course of the experiment.

Experimental Method
Figure 7 illustrates
the apparatus scheme used for electrical
discharge plasma generation over an aqueous solution surface under
an argon environment. The autoclave was fabricated from stainless
steel of a volume of 25 mL (SUS316, AKICO, Tokyo, Japan) and allowed
to work at a temperature of 150 °C and pressure of 30 MPa. This
autoclave was equipped with two sapphire windows to monitor the plasma
generation performance. The generation of electrical discharge plasma
over the aqueous solution surface was started using a titanium rod
as an anode with a diameter of 1.0 mm (TI-451485, Nilaco, Tokyo, Japan),
which was positioned at a distance of 3.0 mm from the surface of an
aqueous solution. This titanium rod was covered by poly(ether ether
ketone) (PEEK) as an insulator, and the annular space was sealed using
an O-ring (Teflon) placed around the outer surface of the rod to prevent
gas leakage. The distance between the aqueous solution surface and
the inside wall chamber as the cathode is 3 cm. The experiment was
performed as follows. Initially, the aqueous solution containing glycine
(7 mL) was loaded into the autoclave manually. After the lid of the
chamber was set and closed tightly, the argon gas was introduced repeatedly
(three times) into the chamber to purge the air. It was then pressurized
and controlled using a needle valve to bring it to the desired conditions
(approximately 4.0 MPa).

Figure 7 Experimental
apparatus scheme.

Although the experiments
were performed
at room temperature (25–28 °C), a thermocouple was frequently
attached to the chamber to monitor the experimental temperature. After
the desired operating condition was realized, the DC power supply
of 18.6 kV (MPC; Suematsu Electronics MPC2000S, Kumamoto, Japan) was
applied in the chamber via the titanium-rod electrode to generate
pulse electrical discharge plasma. This DC power supply allowed us
to control the output voltage, pulse repetition rate, and pulse duration
during the experiment. However, in this work, no power variation was
introduced during the experiments, and the pulse discharge plasma
repetition rate was 4 pulses per second (pps) with a duration of 20 000
pulses. During the experiments, the digital oscilloscope (TDS2024C,
Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, OR) that was equipped with a high-voltage
probe and current transformer was employed to measure the breakdown
voltage and current.14

The collected
aqueous solution products were accommodated in a vial, transferred
to a spectrometric quartz cell, and analyzed using an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrophotometer (V-550, Jasco Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). The morphology and elemental maps of titanium-based nanoparticle
products were characterized using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (JEM-2100Plus, Japan Electronic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (JEOL, JED-2300T &
Gatan, GIF Quantum ER). These products were also characterized using
Raman spectroscopy (NRS-1000, Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The
particle-size distribution of titanium-based nanoparticles was determined
based on TEM images using ImageJ 1.42 image analysis software.
