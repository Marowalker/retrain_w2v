Para-substituted iodobenzenes were reacted with tert-butyl isocyanide and piperidine as nucleophiles in
the presence of palladium–diphosphine catalysts. Both single
and double insertion of the isocyanide was observed and the corresponding
amidines and ketimine–amidines were obtained in yields of practical
interest. With the increase of the tert-butyl isocyanide/iodobenzene
ratio, 100% chemoselectivity toward the ketimine–amidine was
achieved. The formation of the products was rationalized on the basis
of a catalytic cycle analogous to that of the aminocarbonylation reactions.
Clear connection was found between the activity and the electronic
structure of the proposed catalyst Pd(diphosphine) by computational
studies, as the more negative partial charge on palladium resulted
in higher conversion. Among five isocyanide substrates, only tert-butyl isocyanide was proved to be active.

Introduction
Palladium-catalyzed
migratory insertion of carbon monoxide in the
presence of O- and N-nucleophiles,
i.e., the alkoxycarbonylation and aminocarbonylation reactions, is
among the most widely used homogeneous catalytic reactions in synthetic
chemistry.1 Their importance could be illustrated
by the synthesis of simple building blocks and by the functionalization
of compounds of biological relevance.2

Due to the isoelectronic structure of carbon monoxide and its electron-rich
analogue, N-alkyl/aryl isocyanide, described by related
resonance structures (Figure 1), similar palladium-catalyzed homogeneous catalytic reactions
resulting in amidines (carboximidamides) and imidates (carboximidates)
have been described and reviewed recently.3 The amidines and imidates, potentially available in the presence
of N- and O-nucleophiles, respectively,
can be considered as compounds related to the corresponding carboxamides
or esters. In spite of the close analogy, the insertion of isocyanides
in palladium-catalyzed reactions is less explored and has several
limitations both from the side of the substrate and the isocyanide
derivative.

Figure 1 Resonance structures of carbon monoxide and alkyl isocyanide.

A ferrocene-based rigid diphosphine,
dppf, proved to be the most
efficient ligand in the palladium-catalyzed imidoylative (“isonitrile
insertive”) reaction of bromoaromatics.4 Similarly, β-styryl bromide was reacted with tert-butyl isocyanide, primary/secondary amines, and alkoxides/phenoxides
in the presence of the PdCl2–dppf catalyst. In the
case of application of primary amines, the product exists entirely
in the tautomeric form instead of the expected amidine form.5 Bifunctional substrates possessing bromoarene
functionality and a pendant arm with N- or O-nucleophile afforded cyclic amidines and imidates, respectively,
in the palladium-catalyzed reaction.6 Palladium-catalyzed
double isocyanide insertion into the aryl halide bond resulted in
the formation of α-iminoimidates in the presence of O-nucleophiles.7 Recently, a
palladium-catalyzed isocyanide insertion/cyclization sequence was
used for the synthesis of quinazolinones.8 Pyrazines and indols were synthesized from benzyl isocyanides via
double isocyanide insertion.9

One
of the most frequently used “isonitrile-free”
methods, the nucleophilic addition of amines to nitrile functionality,
was used for the synthesis of amidines in the presence of samarium(II)
iodide.10

The use of amidines and
their synthesis by conventional methods
(other than homogeneous catalytic reactions) were shown by a review
published as early as 1944.11 The high
pharmacological importance of amidines (and guanidines) is reported
in a book-chapter.12 Transition metal-catalyzed N-arylation of amidines aiming at the synthesis of various
compounds possessing pharmacological importance, agricultural importance,
etc. was also reviewed.13 Benzimidazole-based
amidines, synthesized from the corresponding nitriles via amidate
esters, have shown antibacterial and antifungal activities.14 High-value cyclic and acyclic amidines can also
be obtained according to a number of patents15 (Scheme 1). As a
synthetic application of amidines, N,N′-bis(aryl) amidines were transformed into 1,2-disubstituted
benzimidazoles via oxidative C–H amination.16

Scheme 1 Synthetic Applications for the Preparation of Amidines
((a) ref (15c), (b)
ref (15b), (c) ref (15a))
As mentioned above, the close analogy of carbon monoxide
and alkyl
isocyanides (Figure 1) encouraged us to investigate the insertion of the latter species
using similar substrates. On the basis of the experiences in palladium-catalyzed
carbonylation reactions,17,18 a systematic investigation
of the corresponding imidoylative reaction, i.e. the related isocyanide
insertion was decided. The goal of this work was to apply this insertion
reaction in a chemoselective manner toward the double insertion by
careful selection of the reaction parameters and to examine the effect
of para substituent on reactivity and selectivity.
Ketimine–amidine derivatives have not yet been synthesized
and described in previous studies. The double insertion was reported
by Whitby et al.7 and Wang et al.8 only for the alkoxycarbonylation reaction. Our
further objective was the elaboration of the influence of various
bidentate phosphines upon the reaction activity and selectivity.

Results
and Discussion
Investigation of the Insertion of tert-Butyl
Isocyanide in the Palladium-Catalyzed Imidoylation of Iodoaromatics
(1a–1q)
Para-substituted iodobenzenes were reacted with tert-butyl isocyanide and piperidine as N-nucleophiles
in the presence of a palladium catalyst formed in situ from palladium(II)
chloride and 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf). The
mixture of two products was obtained in all cases, i.e., amidines
(2a–2q) and ketimine–amidines
(3a–3q) were formed due to simple
and double tert-butyl isocyanide insertion, respectively
(Scheme 2). Other isonitriles
such as 2-pentyl isocyanide, benzyl isocyanide, and 2-naphthyl isocyanide
were also tested but resulted in no conversion. Although the steric
effects cannot be excluded, the inactivity of isonitriles other than
the tert-butyl isocyanide might be explained by the
difference in the electron density distribution of the isonitrile
functional group. According to Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) computed
on natural atomic orbitals basis, the bond order decreases in the
order of tert-butyl, 2-pentyl, benzyl, and naphthyl
with the WBIs of 2.434, 2.428, 2.410, and 2.338, respectively.

Scheme 2 Palladium-Catalyzed Imidoylation of Iodoaromatics via Single and
Double tert-Butyl Isocyanide Insertion
First, experiments were run
to optimize the insertion reactions.
It turned out that the ratio of the substrate to tert-butyl isocyanide is crucial, i.e., although close to complete conversions
were achieved under the given conditions at 1:1.5 and 1:3 ratios (Table 1, entries 1 and 2),
the conversion decreased dramatically when a 1:4 or higher ratio was
used (entries 3–6). At the same time, chemoselectivity was
shifted toward the ketimine–amidine derivative (3a). Compound 3a was formed in low yields but in a chemospecific
reaction. Using bromobenzene (4a) instead of iodobenzene
a lower conversion was achieved but the ratio of the amidine derivative
(2a) was higher (entry 7). No insertion products (2a, 3a) were obtained with chlorobenzene (5a) (entry 8) as the substrate.

A close analogy to carbonylation reactions, and especially, to
aminocarbonylation reactions, can be made. As the increase of the
carbon monoxide pressure (slightly) decreases the catalytic activity
of the system due to the formation of palladium–dicarbonyl/tricarbonyl
catalytic intermediates, the coordination of its electron-rich analogue
(tert-butyl isocyanide) as a ligand (in excess) has
a similar effect. At the same time, the increased concentration of
the tert-butyl isocyanide resulted in double isonitrile
insertion, i.e., the favored formation of 3a. (In the
case of aminocarbonylation reaction, the application of elevated carbon
monoxide pressure resulted in the preferred formation of 2-ketocarboxamides
due to double CO insertion.)

In addition to dppf, three additional
bidentate ligands, 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane
(dppp), 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (xantphos),
and 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe), and three monodentate
ligands, triphenylphosphine (PPh3), tricyclohexylphosphine
(PCy3), and tri-tert-butylphosphine (PtBu3) were tested. In all cases the formation
of 3a was preferred. The catalytic activities of the
Pd–dppp and Pd–dppe systems were lower than that of
the xantphos-containing one (entries 9, 10 and 11). In the case of
the dppe-ligand, the ratio of the products was a bit lower than in
the presence of dppp, but chemoselectivity was practically the same
as that obtained with dppf. The activities of Pd–PCy3 and Pd–PtBu3 systems (entries
12 and 13) were similar to those obtained with Pd–dppe and
Pd–dppp systems. No conversion was obtained in the presence
of PPh3.

Under the optimized conditions, a set of para-substituted
iodobenzenes (1a–1q) were investigated
in the same reaction (Table 2). As observed for the parent substrate (1a),
in general, a mixture of single and double inserted compounds (2 and 3, respectively) was obtained. Although
the reaction tolerates a series of functionalities, the carboxyl and
phenolic OH groups do not allow the formation of the target products.

Investigating the reactivity–Hammett
substituent constant
(σp) and the selectivity–Hammett substituent
constant relations, no linear correlation can be established. High
activities were obtained with substrates possessing both electron-releasing
(entries 2, 7) and electron-withdrawing groups (entries 18, 21). Surprisingly
low activity was observed in the case of phenyl- and chloro-substituted
iodobenzenes (entries 10 and 12). These unexpected conversions might
also be related to the complexity of the reaction mechanism (Scheme 3). However, the lack
of any correlation to Hammett substituent constants might indicate
that the rate-determining step is not the oxidative addition. It should
be one of the steps afterwards.

Scheme 3 Rationalization of the Formation of
the Products Based on a Simplified
Catalytic Cycle
Although the palladium–dppf
and palladium–xantphos
systems gave similar results with the parent iodobenzene (1a), the latter system featured slightly (compare entries 2 and 3,
16 and 17) or definitely lower (compare entries 7 and 8, 18 and 19)
activity using para-substituted derivatives.

It is worth noting that the chloro- and bromo-substituted iodobenzenes
(1j and 1k, respectively) react as an iodoarene
only, i.e., no reaction occurred at the chloro- and bromoarene functionality
(entries 12 and 13).

The formation of the two types of products
can be rationalized
on the basis of the reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 3. The oxidative addition of
substrate (I) is followed by tert-butyl
isocyanide activation (II). The coordinated isocyanide
is inserted into the Pd–aryl bond resulting in Pd-tert-butyliminoacyl intermediate (III). The coordination
of the amine (HNRR1) is accompanied by HX elimination upon
the influence of base (B) and Pd-tert-butyliminoacyl-amido
key-intermediate (IV) is formed. There are two pathways
for further reaction, i.e., either the catalytic cycle-A is closed
via reductive elimination of the amidine product (2)
and the coordinatively unsaturated Pd(0) complex is re-formed or the
coordination of the “second” isocyanide (V) and its insertion into the Pd–N bond resulted in the formation
of Pd-tert-butyliminoacyl-tert-butyliminocarbamoyl
intermediate (VI). The reductive elimination of ketimine–amidine
(3) leads to the Pd(0) complex closing cycle-B.

Computational
Studies on Palladium(0)–Phosphine Complexes
The goal
of the computational studies is to establish a relationship
between the ligand electronic effects of palladium(0)–phosphine
complexes and their catalytic activity. The electronic effects are
addressed by quantum chemical descriptors, such as NPA charges and
critical points within the framework of the Quantum theory of atoms
in molecules (QTAIM) methodology.

The catalytic conversions,
CO frequencies, and the electron density in the ring critical points
(RCPs) are compiled in Table 3. The structures of the 14-electron Pd(0)–diphosphine
complexes are depicted in Figure 2. The experimental conversion showed a notable difference
depending on the various bidentate ligands. The lowest catalytic activity
(55%) was obtained in the case of the dppe-ligand and the highest
one (> 99%) was found for the xantphos-containing complex. These
values
show a reasonable correlation with the chelate angles and NPA charges
of the palladium center. Not surprisingly, the bite angle increases
with the increasing ring size from dppe to xantphos. Apart from the
ring size, spanned by diphosphines and palladium, the difference in
the structures of the Pd-complexes lies in the flexibility of the
chelating ring as dppf19 and xantphos20 show much higher rigidity in comparison to dppe21 and dppp.22

To shed light on the charge density

Pd(xantphos) QTAIM calculations have been performed. Figure 3 shows the contour maps of
the Laplacian of the electron density (∇2ρ)
as well as the bond paths of Pd(dppe) (a) and Pd(xantphos) (b) complexes.
The Pd(xantphos) complex reveals a notable difference from the rest
of the complexes as it has two ring critical points (RCPs), separated
by a bond path connecting the Pd center and the oxygen. The ring critical
point is the point within a ring where the electron density reaches
its minimum. The presence of the bond path suggests a weak Pd–O
interaction, however, the large distance between palladium and oxygen
excludes the possibility for a covalent Pd–O bond.

Conclusions
Palladium-catalyzed aminoimidoylation was
carried out using para-substituted aryl halides as
substrates. The single
and double insertion of tert-butyl isocyanide resulted
in the formation of amidines and ketimine–amidines, respectively.
All iodobenzenes except for the 4-hydroxy- and 4-carboxy-iodobenzene
can be practically fully converted, enabling the isolation of both
types of products, i.e., the reaction tolerates a wide range of substituents.
Bromobenzene resulted in moderate yield toward mainly the formation
of the single insertion product. No catalytic conversion was achieved
with chlorobenzene. By carrying out the reaction under optimized conditions
isolated yields of practical importance can be obtained. A catalytic
reaction applicable for the synthesis of amidines, and especially,
ketimine–amidines of synthetic importance was developed. The
ketimine–amidine derivative was synthesized with 100% chemoselectivity
starting from iodobenzene as the substrate. The reaction conversion
was found to be higher for catalysts possessing more basic diphosphines
as reflected in the partial charge of the palladium center according
to natural bond orbital (NBO) calculations. Among monotertiary phosphines
the more basic P(tBu)3 and PCy3 resulted in moderate catalytic activity and selectivity, whereas
in the presence of triphenylphosphine no conversion was achieved.

Section
General Procedures
NMR spectra (1H and 13C NMR) were recorded in CDCl3 using a Bruker Avance
III 500 spectrometer at 500 and 125.7 MHz, respectively. Chemical
shifts δ are reported in ppm relative to CHCl3 (7.26
and 77.00 ppm for 1H and 13C, respectively).
Hewlett Packard 5830A gas chromatograph fitted with a capillary column
coated with OV-1 (injector temp. 250 °C; oven: starting temp.
50 °C (hold-time 1 min), heating rate 15 °C min–1, final temp. 320 °C (hold-time 11 min); detector temp. 280
°C; carrier gas: helium (rate: 1 mL min–1))
as well as Agilent LC/MSD Trap XCT Plus (electrospray ionizer, eluent:
methanol (0.2 v/v % acetic acid)) were used routinely for the immediate
analysis of the reaction mixtures. An IMPACT 400 spectrometer (Nicolet)
applying a DTGS detector in the region of 400–4000 cm–1 was used to record Fourier-transform infrared spectra in KBr pellets
(mass of the samples: ca. 0.5 mg) with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

Imidoylation Experiments
In a typical experiment, a
solution of PdCl2 (8.8 mg, 0.05 mmol), dppf (27.5 mg, 0.05
mmol), and 1 mmol iodo substrate (1a–1q) was dissolved in 10 mL of toluene under argon. tert-Butyl isocyanide (170 μL, 1.5 mmol) and piperidine (495 μL,
5 mmol) were added to the homogeneous yellow solution. The reaction
was conducted for 72 h at 105 °C. Some metallic palladium was
formed at the end of the reaction which was filtered off. (A sample
of this solution was immediately analyzed by GC–MS.) The mixture
was then concentrated and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved
in chloroform (20 mL) and washed three times with water (20 mL). The
organic phase was thoroughly washed with brine (20 mL), dried over
Na2SO4, and concentrated to a dark brown viscous
material or yellow thick oil. Chromatography on alumina (activated,
neutral) with chloroform/ethyl-acetate (was used from rate 9.5:0.5
to 6:4) yielded the desired compounds as yellow/gray/brown solids
or highly viscous materials.

Computational
Details
All the structures were optimized
without symmetry constraints with tight convergence criteria using
the program ORCA 4.0.123 with the exchange
and correlation functionals developed by Grimme24 containing the D3 empirical dispersion correction with
Becke and Johnson damping.25 Vibrational
analyses made sure that all the structures were genuine minima. For
the palladium atom, the def2-TZVP basis set26 was employed with the respective pseudopotentials.26 For the other atoms, the def2-SVP basis set26 was used. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses
have been performed by the GENNBO 5.0 program.27 Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analyses of
the wave function28 were carried out with
the AIMAll software.29
