Indoor environmental quality directly affects the life
quality
and health of human beings, and therefore, it is highly vital to eliminate
the volatile organic compounds especially formaldehyde (HCHO), which
is regarded as one of the most common harmful pollutants in indoor
air. Hydroxyapatite (HAP)-supported Pt (Pt/HAP) catalysts with a low
content of Pt (0.2 wt %) obtained via hydrothermal and chemical reduction
processes could effectively remove gaseous HCHO from the indoor environment
at room temperature. The influence of modifier in the preparation
on the catalyst activity was investigated. The HAP and HAP modified
by sodium citrate and hexamethylenetetramine-supported 0.2 wt % Pt
could completely decompose HCHO into CO2 and water, while
HAP modified by sodium dodecyl-sulfate-supported Pt removed HCHO primarily
via adsorption. The HAP modified by the sodium citrate catalyst exhibited
superior catalytic performance of HCHO compared to the HAP and HAP
modified by hexamethylenetetramine and sodium dodecyl-sulfate-supported
Pt catalysts, which was mainly because of its higher surface Ca/P
ratio providing more Lewis acidic sites (Ca2+) for co-operational
capture of HCHO molecules and a larger amount of active oxygen species.
Our results indicate that an optimized combination of functional supports
and low-content noble metal nanoparticles could be a route to fabricate
effective room-temperature catalysts for potential application in
indoor air purification.

1 Introduction
Formaldehyde (HCHO), which
could be released from adhesives, paints,
and decorative materials for a long time in an airtight space, is
well known for its harm to human health.1−6 Efficient abatement of HCHO from indoor air is of great importance
to air quality control and environmental safety purposes.7−10 In recent years, HCHO removal at room/ambient temperature over supported
noble metals has attracted enormous attention because of its mild
and “green” operation conditions, that is, no demand
of extra energy and equipment.11−17 Supported Pt catalysts have been considered as the most active catalytic
materials for HCHO oxidation reaction at room temperature,18−22 whose activities are closely influenced by the supports. Oxides/hydroxides
such as TiO2,23 CeO2,24 MnO2,25−27 Co3O4,28 SiO2,29 FeOOH,30 and AlOOH31 have been intensively exploited to immobilize
Pt nanoparticles (NPs) for HCHO decomposition, which take full advantage
of stabilizing highly dispersed Pt NPs, generating active oxygen species
(such as OH, O•, and O2–) resulted from an metal–support interaction and enhancing
the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of HCHO molecules because
of the plenty of surface hydroxyls.32−36 However, the functional composite catalysts possessing
distinct surface acid–base properties, which may exhibit unexpected
HCHO capture and auxiliary oxidation performance, have not yet been
systematically investigated for HCHO elimination at room temperature.

Hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is one of the most stable forms of calcium phosphates,
which is a major inorganic component of human body hard tissues like
bones and teeth. The HAP nanomaterial has been widely investigated
in the biomedical and catalyst-promoter applications because of its
excellent chemical stability, bioactivity, and biocompatibility.37−39 Although HAP was previously reported as an efficient support for
nano-gold (1 wt %) for HCHO oxidation at room temperature,40 which was found to boost the stabilization of
gold NPs against sintering. Nevertheless, the high content of noble
metal (1 wt %) as one of the main defects hinders the practical application
of the catalyst because of its depletable resource and high price.
Since Huang et al. in 2011 reported the Pt/TiO2 with 0.1
wt % loading of Pt for nearly 100% HCHO conversion at ambient temperature,41 some efforts have continued the exploitation
of low-content noble metal NP catalysts for HCHO abatement at room
temperature.42−44 However, it is still imperative to achieve functional
composite catalysts with low loading of noble metal and without compromise
of their catalytic performance. Considering its environmental friendliness,
rich resource and unique surface acid–base character, the HAP-supported
low-content Pt (0.2 wt %) catalyst was prepared and explored for HCHO
removal at room temperature; and the effect of the modifier introduced
in the preparation process on the catalyst surface property and activity
toward HCHO oxidation was investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared HAP samples. All
the major diffraction peaks of the samples were in line with those
of the standard HAP (JCPDS no. 09-0432), suggesting successful synthesis
of the HAP. However, the relative intensities of (210), (211), (112),
and (300) peaks for the obtained samples were different from those
of the standard HAP. This illustrates that the orientation of the
crystal growth was somewhat different, primarily because of the different
preparation conditions. HAP–sodium citrate (SC) presented an
identical XRD pattern to that of HAP, indicating that the introduction
of the modifier did not obviously change the phase structure. Moreover,
no evident difference in the XRD pattern was observed for the supported
Pt catalysts compared to the unsupported samples. This indicates that
Pt deposition did not alter the crystal phase of the HAP support.
No Pt phase was detected, mainly because of a small amount and/or
high dispersion of Pt NPs.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of HAP, Pt/HAP, HAP–SC,
Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–SC-1,
Pt/HAP–SC-2, Pt/HAP–HMT, and Pt/HAP–SDS.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure 2) were used to characterize
the functional
groups of the samples. The bands at ca. 1023, 600, and 563 cm–1 were because of the asymmetrical stretching and bending
vibration of PO4 groups, respectively. The band at ca.
962 cm–1 was assigned to the symmetrical stretching
vibration of PO4 groups, and bands at ca. 3644 and 630
cm–1 were attributed to the stretching and bending
vibration of OH groups in the crystal structure of HAP, respectively.45,46 This phenomenon manifests the existence of PO4 and OH
functional groups in the prepared samples. The bands at 1457, 1417,
872, and 713 cm–1 were because of the vibration
of CO32– groups,47−49 implying that
some PO43– ions in the crystal structure
were replaced by CO32– ions. It also
reveals that the as-prepared samples were the carbonate-containing
apatites.50 Moreover, the modified HAP
(e.g., HAP–SC) and supported Pt samples presented similar FTIR
spectra to those of the pure HAP. No modifier residues were observed,
indicative of a relatively high purity of the obtained samples. Closer
observation is found that the strong P–O band (ca. 1023 cm–1) shifted to a lower wave number for Pt-loaded HAP
compared to that of the pure HAP support (Figure 2b), while no obvious shift was observed for
the OH band (not shown). This is an indication of an interaction between
Pt NPs and PO43– groups.40

Figure 2 (a) FTIR spectra and (b) magnified FTIR spectra between 900 and
1200 cm–1 of HAP, Pt/HAP, HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–SC,
Pt/HAP–SC-1, Pt/HAP–SC-2, Pt/HAP–HMT, and Pt/HAP–SDS.

The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the samples
was conducted
in a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Figure 3, three weight loss regions were observed
in the investigated temperature. The first stage under 150 °C
was attributed to evaporation of adsorbed water. The second region
in the range of 150 and 500 °C was associated with the removal
of chemical adsorbed/structural water.51 The weight loss in the second region for HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–SC,
Pt/HAP–SC-1, Pt/HAP–SC-2, Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–hexamethylenetetramine
(HMT), and Pt/HAP–sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was 7.3, 1.41,
2.56, 1.28, 8.70, 2.86, and 1.50%, respectively. This result revealed
that Pt/HAP–SC had the least amount of chemical adsorbed/structural
water. The last step above 500 °C was because of decarbonation,51 which originated from the CO2 in
air dissolved in the alkaline solution during the preparation process.

The effect of the modifier on HCHO removal is investigated
in Figure 4. The HCHO
concentration
declined with the prolonging reaction time for all samples, and the
HCHO removal performance followed the order: Pt/HAP–SC >
Pt/HAP–HMT
> Pt/HAP > Pt/HAP–SDS. That is, the HCHO removal efficiency
after 60 min was 75, 73, 54, and 48% for Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT,
Pt/HAP, and Pt/HAP–SDS, respectively, which was much higher
than that for Pt/TiO2 (38%). This suggests the superiority
of HAP support to TiO2. The relative CO2 yield
was 1.33, 0.76, 0.57, and about zero for Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT,
Pt/HAP, and Pt/HAP–SDS, respectively. Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT,
and Pt/HAP showed catalytic oxidation of HCHO into CO2 and
H2O at room temperature. Surprisingly, Pt/HAP–SDS
seemed to remove HCHO by adsorption because no product of CO2 was observed. This result indicates that the modifier had an apparent
influence on the catalytic activity of the catalysts. That is to say,
we could achieve a highly efficient catalyst by tuning the modifiers
in this work.

Figure 4 Comparison of HCHO removal (a) and CO2 yield
(b) on
Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT, Pt/HAP–SDS, and
Pt/TiO2.

The Pt/HAP–SC sample showed the best catalytic
performance
for HCHO decomposition into CO2 and H2O at room
temperature. Subsequently, the influence of Pt content on HCHO removal
over Pt/HAP–SC is probed in Figure 5. For HAP–SC and Pt/HAP–SC-1,
a decline in HCHO concentration was observed, accompanied by a decrease
in CO2 concentration. The decrease of HCHO and CO2 concentration in the reactor was mainly adsorbed by the two samples
because of their basic surfaces. Moreover, incomplete oxidation of
HCHO into formate species which cannot be monitored by the equipment,
may also contribute to the decline of gaseous HCHO. As the Pt content
increased to 0.2 wt % (Pt/HAP–SC), the decreased HCHO concentration
and increased CO2 concentration were seen, indicating the
decomposition of HCHO into CO2 and H2O. With
further increasing Pt loading to 0.4 wt % (Pt/HAP–SC-2), the
HCHO removal and CO2 yield further increased. In consideration
of the relatively small specific surface area of the catalysts and
Pt agglomeration, as well as the cost price of Pt in practical application,
the Pt loading in this work was chosen as 0.2 wt %. This result also
demonstrated that complete decomposition of HCHO at room temperature
required an appropriate amount of dispersed Pt for activation of O2 or generation of reactive oxygen species, which triggered
the HCHO oxidation reaction and oxidized its intermediates into CO2 and H2O.

Pt/HAP–SC
with various Pt loadings.

Figure 6 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT,
Pt/HAP–SDS, Pt/HAP, and Pt/HAP–SC. All samples displayed
an appearance of particle agglomeration. However, the difference in
the morphologies of the samples could apparently be recognized. For
example, the mean particle size followed as: Pt/HAP–SC >
Pt/HAP–HMT
≈ Pt/HAP–SDS > Pt/HAP. This implied that the modifier
addition in the preparation process could change the morphology, which
would lead to a difference in the catalytic performance. Compared
to those of HAP–SC, the particle edges of Pt/HAP–SC
became obscure. This was presumably caused by Pt deposition, indicative
of a strong interaction between the HAP support and Pt NPs. However,
the samples in our work exhibited much lower surface areas (listed
in Table 1) than those
obtained via a hydrothermal method (31–43 m2/g).52 As seen from Table 1, the introduction of the modifier in the
preparation process increased the specific surface areas. Pt/HAP–SDS
possessed the largest SBET, which was
similar to that of Pt/HAP–HMT and 1.72 times as large as that
of Pt/HAP–SC. Based on the result of the performance tests,
the specific surface area was not the decisive factor for the catalytic
activity of the samples. The typical EDS spectrum of Pt/HAP–SC
is shown in Figure 6f. Strong peaks attributed to Ca, P, and O elements and weak peaks
because of Na and Pt elements were observed, indicative of the successful
synthesis of HAP-supported Pt catalyst. TEM image (Figure 6g) confirmed that Pt NPs were immobilized
on the HAP support companied by the lattice spacing of 0.222 nm and
0.33 nm associated with Pt (111) and HAP (002) lattice planes, respectively
(inset of Figure 6g).
The vague boundary between Pt and HAP was an indication of the strong
interaction between them.

Figure 7a displays
the hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
patterns of Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–HMT, and Pt/HAP–SDS.
Reduction peaks related to Pt oxides could not be discerned at relatively
low temperature, indicating a negligible amount of Pt oxide and/or
a small amount of Pt immobilized over the support. A strong band at
550–790 °C was observed, attributed to the reduction of
bulk oxygen of the catalysts. It is clearly observed that Pt/HAP–SC
shifted to a lower temperature compared to the other catalysts, presumably
resulting from the strong interaction between Pt NPs and HAP–SC
support. The addition of the modifier in the preparation process may
alter the surface acidity/basicity of the catalysts, which may affect
their catalytic activities toward HCHO removal at room temperature.
To clarify the relationship between the additives and acidic/basic
surface properties of the samples, temperature-programmed desorption
of CO2 (CO2-TPD) measurements were carried out
(Figure 7b). Some distinguished
peaks appeared in the CO2-TPD curves of the four samples,
illustrating the existence of surface basic sites. For Pt/HAP–HMT,
the CO2 desorption peaks were seen at ca. 216, 385, and
706 °C, associated with the weak, moderate, and strong basic
sites, respectively.53 For Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC,
and Pt/HAP–SDS, two peaks were observed at 370–390 and
700–712 °C, related to the moderate and strong basic sites,
respectively. The number of basic sites is proportional to the intensity
of the basic peak. The relatively weaker peak at 370–390 °C
for Pt/HAP–SDS and Pt/HAP–SC indicates a smaller amount
of moderate basic sites. Herein, the number of basic sites seemed
to have no obviously positive effects on the catalytic performance
of the catalysts by comparing the results of CO2-TPD and
the HCHO removal performance. This phenomenon is similar to the observation
of the previous literature.53

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra
for Pt/HAP,
Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT, and Pt/HAP–SDS are presented
in Figure 8. High-resolution
XPS spectra of Ca 2p and P 2p peaks in Figure 8a,b confirmed the successful preparation
of HAP. The atomic ratios of Ca/P are summarized in Table 1, with the value of 1.81, 1.84,
1.80, and 1.49 for Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT, and
Pt/HAP–SDS, respectively. Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, and Pt/HAP–HMT
presented a higher Ca/P ratio compared to that of the stoichiometric
Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. It manifests
that Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, and Pt/HAP–HMT possessed calcium-enriched
surfaces,54 with CO32– anions introduced to compensate the charge caused by excess calcium
cations in the apatite solids.50 However,
Pt/HAP–SDS showed a lower Ca/P ratio than that of Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (Ca/P = 1.67), suggesting
that it possessed a nonstoichiometric Ca-deficient surface with the
introduction of H+ ions and depletion of OH– ions denoted by the formula Ca10–Z(HPO4)Z(PO4)6–Z(OH)2–Z (0 < Z < 1).55 That is to say, Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, and Pt/HAP–HMT
acted as basic catalysts with the presence of acid sites, and Pt/HAP–SDS
acted as an acid catalyst with the existence of basic sites.56,57 The diversity in the surface chemical property could lead to distinct
performances for HCHO adsorption and subsequent catalytic oxidation
activity. Therefore, it is easy to understand a higher activity of
Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, and Pt/HAP–HMT than that of Pt/HAP–SDS
because the basic surface facilitates the capture of gaseous HCHO
molecules.

(d) for Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT, and Pt/HAP–SDS.

The core level of Pt 4f7/2 (71.1–71.3
eV) and
Pt 4f5/2 (74.4–74.6 eV) in Figure 8c illustrated the metallic state of Pt in
the samples,58 further confirming the successful
deposition of Pt NPs over the HAP supports. Three peaks at 531.2,
531.8, and 532.7 eV were deconvoluted in the O 1s spectra of the samples
(Figure 8d), corresponding
to oxygen of PO43–, CO32–, and OH anion (OOH)/adsorbed oxygen species
(Oads) originated from the strong interaction between Pt
and HAP support, respectively.59,60 The percentage of (OOH + Oads)/Ototal was 8.5, 10.3, 8.5,
and 6.2% for Pt/HAP, Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP–HMT, and Pt/HAP–SDS
(listed in Table 1),
respectively. Considering the lowest content of chemical adsorbed/structural
water in the TG analysis, the obtained data indicated that Pt/HAP–SC
had the largest amount of adsorbed oxygen species. Usually, a higher
content of active adsorbed oxygen species is beneficial to catalytic
oxidation of HCHO molecules, which could be the main reason for the
superior performance of Pt/HAP–SC.

The electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) of the catalyst before
test and after test is shown in Figure 9. The signal at g = 2.027 for Pt/HAP–SC
before HCHO oxidation test could be approximately attributed to surface-bound
superoxide radical anions (O2–).61,62 The O2– species presumably originated
from surface anion vacancies located at or adjacent to the Pt and
HAP interface,57,62,63 which were promoted by the strong interaction between Pt NPs and
hydroxyl groups of HAP. After the Pt/HAP–SC catalyst was exposed
in the HCHO gas, the signals attributable to superoxide radical anions
disappeared, implying that the active oxygen species quickly participated
in the oxidation reaction of HCHO molecules.

Figure 9 EPR spectra of Pt/HAP–SC
(a) before and (b) after HCHO oxidation
test.

In situ diffused reflectance infrared Fourier transform
(DRIFT)
spectra in Figure 10 were used to study the possible reaction pathway of HCHO oxidation
over the Pt/HAP–SC catalyst. After the reactant HCHO/O2 gas was in contact with the catalyst (Figure 10a), some featured DRIFT peaks were observed,
revealing the occurrence of HCHO oxidation over the catalyst. The
broad band centered at ca. 3268 cm–1 was related
to the generated water in the HCHO oxidation reaction process. The
peaks at 2979, 2897, and 2822 cm–1 were caused by
C–H stretching bands of adsorbed HCOO [(HCOO)ads] and adsorbed HCHO, respectively.64 The
peaks at ca. 1602, 1540, 1507, and 1340 cm–1 were
related to the vibration of adsorbed formate species, and peaks at
1457 and 1418 cm–1 were associated with CO32– ions,50 resulted
from the CO2 product and/or CO2 in the atmosphere
reacting with the OH– of the catalyst. Some new
small peaks at ca. 3853, 3750, 3649, 3567, 2979, 1868, 1844, and 1771–1716
cm–1 were observed with increasing the reaction
time to 20 min. The peaks at 1771–1716 cm–1 were because of the carbonyl group of adsorbed HCHO on different
surface sites of the catalyst,65 and peaks
at ca. 3853, 3750, 3649, and 3567 cm–1 were because
of the hydroxyl groups of the HCHO derivatives.66,67 Peaks at 1868 and 1844 cm–1 were connected with
the bridging CO bonded to the surface of the catalyst.68,69 It can be deduced that the adsorbed HCHO molecules were quickly
oxidized into formate or CO species. This phenomenon suggests that
the further oxidation of formate and CO intermediates is the rate-determining
step. In the HCHO/N2 gas flow (Figure 10b), a broad band at ca. 3276 cm–1 could be discerned, indicative of the generation of water. Moreover,
the peak related to adsorbed formate (1600 cm–1)
and small bands associated with the C–H stretching bands of
adsorbed formate (2892 and 2801 cm–1) appeared,
which increased with increasing the reaction time to 40 min and remained
almost constant with further increasing the reaction time to 60 min.
Negative peaks at ca. 3569–3850 cm–1 were
related to the consumption of isolated surface hydroxyls. This phenomenon
illustrated that the active surface hydroxyls directly participated
in the decomposition of HCHO into formate species.

Figure 10 In situ DRIFT spectra
of HCHO oxidation over the Pt/HAP–SC
catalyst in gas flows of (a) HCHO + O2and (b) HCHO + N2.

The recycle performance for HCHO removal over the
Pt/HAP–SC
catalyst is shown in Figure 11a. The removal capacity of the catalyst decreased during the
initial three runs and then remained almost unchangeable for the next
runs with about a half of the first removal efficiency. It implies
that the obtained catalyst with much low Pt content possessed a relatively
stable activity toward HCHO removal. In order to uncover the reason
of the catalyst deactivation, the FTIR spectra before and after HCHO
test for the Pt/HAP–SC catalyst are investigated in Figure 11b. Some new peaks
appeared in the spectrum after HCHO test. For example, the peak at
3572 cm–1 was because of the intermolecular hydrogen
bond resulted from the (HCOO)ads, and peaks at 2979 and
2874 cm–1 were attributed to the νs(C–H) in (HCOO)ads.31,70 The small
peak at 2513 cm–1 is because of CO32– substituting PO43– groups
of HAP,71 and peaks at 1795 and 1590 cm–1 were ascribed to the νs(CO) and
νas(COO) in (HCOO)ads,12,66 respectively. Moreover, a shift to a higher wavenumber was observed
in the range of 900 and 1500 cm–1 after the test,
suggesting a strong interaction between adsorbed species and the catalyst.
These phenomena implied that the formate species were strongly adsorbed
on the surface of the catalyst, in agreement with the DRIFT result.
Thus, the adsorbed species on the catalyst surface were presumed to
be the main factor for the loss of the catalyst activity.

performance and (b) comparison of the FTIR spectra
before and after the HCHO test over the Pt/HAP-SC catalyst.

According to the above results, the pathway for
HCHO removal over
Pt/HAP–SC at room temperature is proposed in Figure 12. First, HCHO molecules were
captured by HAP via hydrogen bonding between the H atom of HCHO and
O atom of PO43– and simultaneously via
weak electrostatic attraction between Ca of HAP and O atom of HCHO
(step I). In the meantime, oxygen from air was adsorbed on the surface
of Pt NPs which interacted with and stabilized by PO43– ions of the support. The adsorbed oxygen molecules
on the Pt surface interacted with hydroxyl ions (OH–) nearby the Ca2+. Then, the adsorbed oxygen molecules
and hydroxyl ions (OH–) concurrently evolved into
superoxide radical anions (O2–) and hydroxyl
radicals [(OH)ads], respectively, resulting to the formation
of OH– vacancies (δ+) (step II).39,50 The active surface hydroxyls/generated (OH)ads and/or
superoxide radical anions (O2–) attacked
the adsorbed HCHO (step III), leading to the formation of adsorbed
HCOOH [(HCOOH)ads] and/or [(CO)ads] (step III),72 and the regeneration of hydroxide ion adjacent
to Ca. Finally, the (HCOOH)ads and (CO)ads were
further oxidized to CO2 and H2O by the active
oxygen species on the catalyst surface (step IV). It can be speculated
that exposed Ca2+, PO43–,
and OH– play co-operational roles in gaseous HCHO
adsorption and decomposition. Therefore, it is one of the reasons
that Pt/HAP–SC, Pt/HAP, and Pt/HAP–HMT displayed better
catalytic performance of HCHO oxidation because of their higher surface
Ca/P ratios compared to that of Pt/HAP–SDS based on the XPS
analysis.

temperature.

3 Conclusions
HAP-based catalysts with
a low loading of Pt (0.2 wt %) synthesized
by hydrothermal and NaBH4 reduction were investigated for
HCHO removal at room temperature. The organic additive had a visible
effect on the activity of the HAP-based catalysts. Pt/HAP–SC
possessed a superior catalytic performance among the studied samples
mainly because of its plenty of active oxygen species and high surface
Ca/P ratio, which played a synergistic effect in HCHO capture. The
formation of active oxygen species presumably induced by the strong
interaction between Pt NPs and HAP support should be responsible for
the catalytic performance for HCHO oxidation at room temperature.
Gaseous HCHO molecules were first adsorbed and then oxidized into
formate or CO species, which were finally decomposed into CO2 and H2O on the Pt/HAP–SC surface. This work provides
some insight into the design and fabrication of functional catalysts
with low cost for environmental remediation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
HAP was synthesized
as follows. 4.78 g of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water (solution I), and 1.58
g of Na2HPO4·12H2O was dissolved
in 40 mL of 2 mol/L NaOH solution (solution II). The solution I and
II was mixed at 40 °C under magnetic stirring for 8 h. Then,
the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated
at 180 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the obtained precipitate was
centrifuged and washed by deionized water several times and dried
at 60 °C in a vacuum oven. Finally, the obtained powder was calcined
at 700 °C for 2 h with a rate of 5 °C/min.

The modified
HAP was obtained by using the abovementioned procedure of pure HAP
except that solution I consisted of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (4.78 g) and the modifiers (0.1 g), for example,
SC, SDS, or HMT.

The supported Pt catalysts were prepared according
to our previous
reports.24,31 Briefly, 0.4 g of HAP or modified HAP powder
or TiO2 (Haijing Fine Chemical Factory in Hebei district
of Tianjin) was dispersed in 30 mL of deionized water, and then a
H2PtCl6 solution possessing varied nominal weight
of Pt (0.4, 0.2, and 0.08 wt %) was added under magnetically stirring.
Thereafter, 5 mL of a reducing mixture of NaBH4 (0.1 mol/L)
and NaOH (0.1 mol/L) was immediately injected to the above suspension
and stirred intensely for another 30 min. Finally, the resulting slurry
was washed twice with deionized water and ethanol and dried at 60
°C in a vacuum oven. The nomenclature and concise information
of the obtained samples are listed in Table 2.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
Powder
XRD diffractograms were recorded on an X’Pert powder diffractometer
(PANalytical), and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15419 nm) was
applied. Nitrogen sorption was determined on a Micromeritics ASAP
2020 system, and the samples were pretreated under vacuum at 120 °C
for 4 h. The adsorption branch of the adsorption–desorption
isotherm was used to obtain the pore-size distribution. SEM and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using an S-4800 microscope
(Hitachi, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer,
and a JEM-2100F microscope (JEOL, Japan), respectively. XPS spectra
were achieved on an ESCALAB 250xi spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
Binding energy of all elements was referenced to the C 1s peak energy
of the contaminant carbon at 284.8 eV. EPR spectra were collected
at room temperature using a Bruker E500 instrument operating at the
X band (∼9.853 GHz). The center field was 3510 G, and the g
value was determined from precise frequency and magnetic field values.
TG analysis was performed on a DTG-60H analyzer (SDT Q600, USA) in
a flow of N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. H2-TPR tests were carried out on a BELCAT-B (Japan) apparatus
equipped with a TCD. In a typical experiment, the catalysts were first
pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h with a He atmosphere and cooled
to room temperature. Next, the temperature was ramped to 800 °C
with a ramp of 10 °C/min with the introduction of the reducing
gas (10% H2/Ar). In the experiment of CO2-TPD,
the catalysts were pretreated at 300 °C with a He atmosphere
for 1 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the catalysts were
exposed in CO2 for 30 min. Then, the catalysts were purged
with He at room temperature for 30 min to remove the physically adsorbed
molecular CO2. Finally, CO2-TPD profiles were
recorded with a ramp of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 800
°C under a He stream. FTIR spectra and in situ DRIFT spectra
were collected using a Thermo Fisher 6700 instrument. In the in situ
DRIFT spectra experiments, the catalysts in the in situ cell reactor
were pretreated in a nitrogen flow at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently,
a mixed gas of HCHO/O2 or HCHO/N2 was introduced
into the DRIFT reactor at room temperature via an individual mass
flow meter at a flow rate of 30 mL/min.

4.3 Catalytic Performance Test
The performance
experiments were conducted in a 6 L organic glass reactor as reported
in our previous work.20,24 A specified amount of the sample
(0.1 mg) was first scattered in a glass Petri dish and placed into
the chamber followed by covering with a glass slide. After the reactor
was sealed, a certain amount of condensed HCHO (38%) was injected
into the reactor. Then, the liquid HCHO was quickly volatilized to
the gaseous phase assisted by a 5 W fan at the bottom of the reactor.
The test started by removing the cover from the Petri dish until the
concentration of gaseous HCHO reached a stable value. Concentrations
of gaseous HCHO, CO2, CO, and H2O were online
monitored using the Photoacoustic IR Multigas Monitor.

The catalytic
performance of the samples was expressed by HCHO removal (Ct/C0) and CO2 generation (ΔCO2/C0), where ΔCO2 is the difference between
CO2 concentration at a reaction time t and initial CO2 concentration and C0 is the equilibrium HCHO concentration before the test which
was set at ca. 180 ppm in this work. Ct and Cf are the HCHO
concentration at reaction time t and 60 min, respectively.
The formaldehyde removal efficiency was obtained as following:
