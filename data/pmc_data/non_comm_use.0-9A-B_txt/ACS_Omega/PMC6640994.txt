Elucidating the reaction
mechanism of steam methane reforming (SMR)
is imperative for the rational design of catalysts for efficient hydrogen
production. In this paper, we provide mechanistic insights into SMR
on Ru surface using first principles calculations based on dispersion-corrected
density functional theory. Methane activation (i.e., C–H bond
cleavage) was found to proceed via a thermodynamically exothermic
dissociative adsorption process, resulting in (CHy + zH)* species (“*” denotes
a surface-bound state, and y + z = 4), with C* and CH* being the most stable adsorbates. The calculation
of activation barriers suggests that the conversion of C* into O-containing
species via C–O bond formation is kinetically slow, indicating
that the surface reaction of carbon intermediates with oxygen is a
possible rate-determining step. The results suggest the importance
of subsequent elementary reactions following methane activation in
determining the formation of stable carbon structures on the surface
that deactivates the catalyst or the conversion of carbon into O-containing
species.

1 Introduction
The
emerging shift to another viable source
of energy in the so-called hydrogen-based society creates a tremendous
demand for hydrogen. Until now, the steam reforming of methane is
one of the most used processes in the production of hydrogen.1 Because methane is thermodynamically very stable,
steam methane reforming (SMR) is a highly endothermic process that
requires a temperature of 900 K or higher.2

SMR proceeds via the reaction  

A number of mechanisms have been proposed for
this reaction. Some models assume that the rate-determining step is
the decomposition of methane that forms chemisorbed CHy (y = 0–3) radicals.3−5 Another model considers the surface
reaction of carbon intermediates with adsorbed oxygen as the rate-determining
step.6 Despite these theoretical and other
experimental studies, the elementary steps that comprise the overall
reaction still remain unclear.
Thus, it is imperative to understand the thermodynamics of the elementary
steps of SMR at the atomic scale.

Although only a few theoretical
studies have been carried out to elucidate the reaction mechanism
of SMR, most of these studies have used Ni, Rh, and Pt.7−10 On
the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, only methane activation
on Ru(0001) has been studied.11 This is
surprising as Ru-catalyzed SMR is significant from industrial and
scientific points of view. First, there is a general consensus from
experiments that precious metals such as Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd have high
activity for SMR, although Ni is most frequently used because of its
lower cost.12−15 Second, experiments have shown that Ru is
catalytically active for both carbon formation on the surface that
leads to catalyst deactivation and SMR.12,14,15 Thus, it is scientifically interesting to explore
new mechanistic insights into the catalytic pathways toward carbon
formation and SMR on Ru. These results will provide significant insights
into the rational design of catalysts that promote an efficient SMR
reaction.

In this paper, we present new insights into the reaction
mechanism of SMR using Ru as the catalyst. We performed first principles
calculations based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory
(DFT-D2) to analyze the structures and energetics of possible intermediate
species in the SMR reaction and the thermodynamics of proposed elementary
reaction pathways for the overall reaction.

2 Computational
Model
It is by now clear
that corrugated surfaces are more reactive for SMR.8,16−18 The B5 site
on a unique step-edge-type model on Ru(0001) has now been recognized
as an active site especially for the bond cleavage of π bonds
of diatomic molecules.19,20 As shown in Figure 1a, a B5 site is composed of
a fourfold hollow site (atoms 1–4) and a threefold hollow site
(atoms 3–5). Hu and co-workers have proposed a slab model for
such B5 sites, where the surface can be conveniently constructed by
removing two neighboring rows on one side of the slab.21,22 Such a model for a step-edge-type site on Ru(0001) was also used
for the DFT investigation of other reactions such as Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis and ammonia synthesis.23,24 Our calculations
have used a similar slab model, composed of four layers of (4 ×
3) supercell, separated by around 14 Å of vacuum space, as shown
in Figure 1b. Calculation
of the density of states projected on the d band of Ru for the bulk
case, clean Ru(0001) surface or terrace site, and step-edge site shows
that with respect to the bulk case, the occupied states of the d band
are “forward-shifted” (skewed) to the Fermi level (EF) for the case of surface Ru atom, with the
greatest shift for the step site, followed by that for the terrace
site. This is shown schematically in Figure 2. Accordingly, the calculated d band centers25 are −2.89, −2.55, and −2.47
eV for the bulk, terrace, and step sites, respectively. These indicate
that the step-edge site is more reactive than the terrace site.

(b) supercell used.

the atom-projected d band
of Ru for the bulk case, terrace site (clean (0001) surface), and
step-edge site.

The stable adsorption
configuration of the molecules considered in
this study was determined by exhausting a number of different orientations
on the surface. The top two layers of the slab and adsorbates were
fully relaxed in all directions, whereas the bottom two layers were
held fixed at their bulk structure. The optimization of isolated gas-phase
molecules was performed with one free molecule within a 25 ×
25 × 25 Å unit cell. Adsorption energies, Eads, were computed by taking the difference between the
total energy of the adsorbate-slab system in the lowest-energy adsorption
configuration and the summed energies of the optimized clean surface
and the gas-phase molecule. The Gibbs free energy GA* of the adsorbed species A* (“*” denotes
the surface-bound species) was calculated by adding the zero-point
vibrational energy and the vibrational energy change for temperature
increase from 0 to T K (ΔEvib,0→T) and subtracting the vibrational
entropy. The vibrational terms can be conveniently combined into the
Helmholtz vibrational energy, denoted by Fvib  

The Gibbs free energy of gas-phase
molecules
(A) was computed similarly, by adding the contributions of rotational
and translational degrees of freedom to entropy and the PV term  

Spin-polarized DFT
calculations were carried out using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)26−29 within the
generalized gradient approximation based on Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof30−33 functional
with an empirical dispersion correction of Grimme (DFT-D2).34 This van der Waals correction was shown to be
suitable in describing the adsorption of molecules on metals.35 Harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated
using the finite difference method with a step size of 0.02 Å.
The interaction between ions and electrons was described using the
projector-augmented wave method.36,37 Plane-wave
basis sets were used with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. Electric dipole
correction was used to cut the dipole interactions between the repeated-image
layer systems. The surface Brillouin zone integrations were performed
on a grid of 4 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-points38 using Methfessel–Paxton
smearing39 of σ = 0.2 eV. A conjugate-gradient
algorithm40 was used to relax the ions
into their ground state.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Adsorption of Molecules
We considered (COxHy + zH)*-type
of adsorbed molecule species, with x = 0–2
and z, y = 0–4, and various
isomerization (e.g., COH and CHO), for the complete four H2 production process. This type of molecules (AOxHy, where A is carbon or boron)
was also used in our previous studies exploring the elementary steps
of borohydride electrochemical oxidation.41,42 The
optimal adsorption configurations of these molecules are shown in Figure 3. The corresponding
adsorption energies, arranged in an increasing number of O and H atoms
in the molecules, are plotted in Figure 4. The actual values of adsorption energies
and other stable configurations of molecules can be found in Table S1 and Figure S1, respectively.

Figure 4 Adsorption
energies of different molecules.

3.1.1 CHy (y = 0–4) Adsorption
C* has the largest adsorption
energy (absolute value) among the
species considered. It is adsorbed at the fourfold hollow site with
an average Ru–C distance of 2.03 Å, in agreement with
a previous study on Ru(101̅0) surface.43 Carbon adsorption at the fourfold hollow site was also reported
on stepped Co(112̅4) surface.43 Adsorption
at the near-edge hcp site is 0.17 eV less stable than that at the
fourfold hollow site.

Similar to carbon, CH* is strongly bound
on the surface and binds at the fourfold hollow site, in agreement
with a previous study on Ru(101̅0) surface.43 The C–H bond length is 1.10 Å and the average
Ru–C distance is 2.15 Å, in excellent agreement with a
previous study on Ru(101̅0) surface.43 The adsorption energy of CH* is slightly smaller in magnitude than
that of C*. Accordingly, it can be noted that the average Ru–C
distance is greater for the case of CH* than for C*.

CH2* adsorbs near the
bridge site of two step-edge atoms. It forms a bent shape with an
average C–H bond length of 1.10 Å and H–C–H
angle of 113°. The average Ru–C distance of CH2* with the two step-edge
atoms is 2.06 Å, in agreement with a related study.43

CH3* binds on an adsorption site similar to CH2*. The Ru–C
distances with the two Ru atoms at the step-edge are 2.14 and 2.30
Å, in excellent agreement for the case of Ru(101̅0).43 The average C–H bond length is 1.12 Å,
which is also in agreement with a previous study.42

CH4* weakly adsorbs on a step-edge atom with the two H atoms pointing
toward the surface. An analysis of the local density of states projected
on the sp states of CH4 and Ru atom at the step-edge site
nearest to the adsorbed CH4 shows the broadening of the
sp states of CH4 compared with the delta peaks in the isolated
gas-phase CH4, which indicates weak chemisorption. The
average C–H bond length for H atoms pointing to the surface
is 0.02 Å longer than that for the case of H atoms pointing away
from the surface. This indicates a weak interaction between the H
atoms pointing toward the surface and Ru atoms, which was also noted
for the case of Ru(101̅0).43 A similar
“tilted” adsorption configuration for a molecule with
a tetrahedral structure was previously noted for the case of borohydride
on Au–Ni alloys, which indicates susceptibility to bond-breaking
reactions.41

For CHy-type species, the adsorption energy decreases in magnitude
as the number of C–H bonds in the molecule increases. However,
it must be noted that this trend in adsorption energy does not necessarily
imply that all dehydrogenation steps (methane decomposition) are exothermic.
C* and CH* are the most stable species, as similarly noted for the
case of Ni catalysts.10

3.1.2 COHy (y = 0–4)
Adsorption
CO*
binds on an adsorption site similar to CH2* and CH3*. It has a much lesser adsorption energy than
CH*, which binds lower into the fourfold hollow site, indicating a
weaker Ru–C interaction for CO*compared with CH*. The preference
of CO to bind at this site was also noted in CO dissociation on Ru(112̅1).23 The C–O bond length is 1.19 Å, whereas
the average Ru–C distance is 2.07 Å. These are very close
to the calculated C–O bond length (1.15 Å) and Ru–C
distance (1.94 Å) for CO adsorption on Ru(0001).44

COH* and CHO* are important intermediates in the
formation of C–O bonds.7,45 COH* binds on the step-edge
corner with C at the fourfold hollow site. Only C binds with Ru atoms,
with an average Ru–C distance of 2.16 Å. In the case of
CHO*, both C and O atoms directly interact with Ru atoms. The average
Ru–O and Ru–C distances are 2.16 and 2.09 Å, respectively.

CH2O* binds on the step-edge atoms via the Ru–O
bond with a length of 1.93 Å. The C–O bond is approximately
parallel to the surface, with a length of 1.38 Å. CHOH* binds
at the step-edge with a Ru–C distance of 2.10 Å. Contrary
to that of CH2O*, the C–O bond of CHOH* is perpendicular
to the surface, with a length of 1.38 Å.

CH3O* is a proposed reaction intermediate for the decomposition of methanol.45 It adsorbs at the step-edge, bridging two Ru
atoms with an average Ru–O distance of 2.06 Å. The C–O
bond length is stretched to 1.44 Å from 1.36 Å in the gas
phase, indicating a weakened C–O bond. The hydrogen atoms are
pointing away from the surface.

CH2OH* is highly
unstable on the surface as its optimization at different sites leads
to dissociated structures containing either CO*, COH*, or CHOH*. A
molecular structure that is relatively far from the surface was found
with the shortest Ru–C distance of 2.13 Å. The C–O
bond is elongated by 0.04 Å from its gas-phase structure, making
it easy to break into OH* and CH2* on the surface.

CH3OH* binds
at the step-edge with two H atoms pointing toward the surface. Optimization
at the other sites leads to dissociated structures. The C–O
bond length is 1.41 Å. The C–H bond length for the H atom
close to the surface is longer than that for the other H atoms, indicating
a weak interaction between Ru and H, as noted for CH4* in the previous section.

3.1.3 CO2Hy (y = 0–3) Adsorption
CO2* adsorbs
at the step-edge with a bent configuration, in contrast to its linear
structure in the gas phase. This adsorption structure was also found
for other surfaces such as γ-Al2O3 and
Cu2O and is attributed to surface defects and corrugation.48,49 The average C–O distance is 1.29 Å, whereas the O–C–O
angle is 122°.

COOH* binds at the step-edge via Ru–C
and Ru–O bonds. The initial C=O bond in the gas phase
was stretched from 1.19 to 1.28 Å in the adsorbed state, indicating
the weakening of this bond as C and O bind with Ru. The other C–O
bond that points away from the surface was shortened by only 0.01
Å, suggesting that it has not been significantly affected by
the adsorption process.

C(OH)2* binds at the step-edge with a Ru–C
bond length of 1.99 Å. One O–H bond points away from the
surface, whereas the other one points toward the surface. The O–H
bond that points toward the surface is 0.03 Å longer than the
other one, indicating a weak Ru–H interaction as similarly
noted for other molecules. The surface parallel and perpendicular
C–O bonds are 1.33 and 1.34 Å, respectively.

CH(OH)2* binds on the step-edge
atoms through Ru–C and Ru–O bonds with lengths of 2.10
and 2.22 Å, respectively. The two O–H bonds point toward
the surface, whereas the C–H bond points away from the surface.

3.2 Thermodynamics
of Elementary Steps
There are a number of proposed reaction
mechanisms for the complete steam reforming of methane.9,10,45,50 These
involve elementary reactions such as methane activation,9 CO formation,9,45 water–gas
shift reaction,6 and water activation.9 In the current study, the following reaction
coordinate is proposed  where x = 0–2; z, y = 0–4;
and α = 4 + 2x – y – z. The free energy change of this reaction, ΔGR, gives the relative free energy of adsorbed
species (COxHy + zH)* that corresponds to a particular α-step.  

This was used to construct a free energy diagram that facilitates
the comparison of reaction pathways. Figure 5 shows the free energy diagram for this reaction,
evaluated at T = 600 °C and P = 10 bar, which are the typical values
in experiments.45,46 Each process to the right corresponds
to one α-step. In each α-step, the number of atoms from
the initial CH4,gas state is conserved. For example, in
α = 2 step, a possible reaction is CH4 + H2O + * → CH3OH* + H2.

Figure 5 Free energy
diagram that shows the relative
free energy of molecules in the proposed reaction pathway.

3.2.1 Methane Activation
Methane activation
is the C–H bond cleavage reaction of a highly stable CH4. Results have shown that its adsorption on the Ru surface
is highly exothermic and dissociative, as shown by the α = 0
step reaction in the energy diagram. Molecular adsorption is less
exothermic compared with dissociative adsorption that results in (CHy + zH)* (with y + z = 4) species. The adsorption configuration
of CHy* species in (CHy + zH)* follows the case of no zH* coadsorption. The
formation of C* and CH* with coadsorbed H* is highly exothermic, and
their conversions to other species are largely endothermic. These
radicals are strongly adsorbed on the surface, as shown in Figure 4. This indicates
that C* and CH* are the most stable surface-bound species, as similarly
noted for the case of Ni catalysts.10 This
supports the experimental finding that Ru is active for carbon formation
on the surface.12−15

The reaction energy diagram shows
that at low adsorbate coverage used in this calculation, the subsequent
elementary steps that would desorb H* from (C + 4H)* are highly endothermic.
However, because this complete dissociation of methane produces four
H* for every one C*, increasing the rate of methane dissociation would
result in a much higher coverage of H* on the surface than C*. Previous
studies have shown that the associative desorption of H* into H2 gas (hydrogen evolution) becomes more favorable as the surface
coverage of H* increases.51

The production
of methanol (CH3OH) from methane has been reported in the
literature for various applications.47 On
the basis of the free energy diagram, CH3OH* can be produced
on the surface by the C–O bond formation of CH3 with
OH*, as shown by the blue path. However, it can easily be dehydrogenated
into CH2OH* or CH3O*, which agrees with an experiment
that detected CH3O as an intermediate species for methanol
decomposition.51,52 The dehydrogenation of CH2OH* and CH3O* into coadsorbed CO* and H* proceeds
downhill in energy.

3.2.2 Carbon Conversion
As shown in the free energy diagram,
at α = 4 step, an isolated C* (i.e., no H* coadsorption) is
thermodynamically unstable in relative energy compared with the other
species in the same α-step. This corresponds to the low C* adsorbate
coverage limit. Its conversion via the CO* formation pathway to the
final CO2* product
is exothermic, as shown by the red dashed line. CO* formation can
proceed via COH* or CHO* intermediate. The conversion of COH* or CHO*
to CO* proceeds uphill in energy, whereas CO* can be converted to
COOH* exothermically. These results support the experimental finding
that the rate-determining steps in SMR produce CO and CO2 from CHO intermediate species.53

The same instability of isolated C* compared with other species in
the α = 4 step is also noted for (C + 2H)* and (C + H)* in the
α = 2 and α = 3 steps, respectively. This indicates that
C* with fewer coadsorbed H* is less thermodynamically stable in relative
energy than that with more H* such as in (C + 3H)* and (C + 4H)*.

3.3 Activation Barriers
It can be noted
that although the use of reaction energies to determine
the catalytic activity of a catalyst is computationally convenient,
it is a very simple approximation as the overall SMR reaction can
be dictated by elementary reaction kinetics that involves the breaking
of C–H and O–H bonds and the formation of C–O
bonds. Hence, it is imperative to calculate the activation barriers
for these bond formation/cleavage processes for elementary steps.
These calculations were implemented utilizing the climbing-image nudge
elastic band method54,55 within VASP using four images
between the initial and the final states, as previously performed
in our previous studies.56−58

3.3.1 C–H
Bond
Cleavage
Methane activation (i.e., C–H bond cleavage
of methane) together with the CO formation step was found to be kinetically
relevant for SMR on transition metals.3−5,9,59,60 The breaking of one C–H
bond of methane was calculated via a molecularly adsorbed methane
precursor  

The initial, transition, and final
states for
this reaction are shown in Figure 6a. The calculated activation barrier is 1.02 eV. It
can be noted that this reaction pathway involves the translation of
the molecule’s central atom at the step-edge site.

Figure 6 Initial (left
panel), transition (middle panel), and final (right panel) states
for the following reactions: (a) CH4* →
(CH3 + H)*, (b) (C + OH)* →
COH*, (c) COH* → (CO + H)*, and (d) H2O* →
(OH + H)*.

3.3.2 C–O
Bond Formation
The thermodynamics of elementary reactions
presented in the previous
section has shown the possibility of converting C* into O-containing
species. The activation barrier for this reaction was calculated via
the C–O bond formation pathway in the following reaction  

The initial, transition,
and final states for this reaction are shown in Figure 6b. The calculated activation barrier for
this reaction is 1.24 eV. This is very close to the calculated activation
barrier for the same reaction on Rh(211).9 This relatively high barrier suggests that this process is kinetically
slower than methane activation. This supports a previous model that
considers the surface reaction involving C–O bond formation
leading to CO2 (rather than COH) as the rate-determining
step.6 However, in this model, Ni/MgAl2O4 was used as a catalyst, and the models were
based on postulated kinetics fitted to the experimental data.6

3.3.3 O–H Bond Cleavage
The O–H bond cleavage
was considered for the following cases of C-containing species and
H2O molecules (water activation)    

The first reaction is important because one suggested pathway for
SMR is through the CO formation reaction pathway. On the other hand,
the second reaction would determine whether the formation of OH and
H on the surface is kinetically relevant or not.

The initial,
transition, and final states for the first reaction are shown in Figure 6c. This reaction
requires an activation barrier of 0.94 eV. This is lower than the
case of C–O bond formation, indicating that for this molecule,
it is easier for O to dissociate from H than to form a bond with C.

For the second reaction, the initial, transition, and final states
are shown in Figure 6d. It was found that O–H bond cleavage for H2O
requires an activation barrier of 0.48 eV.

4 Conclusions
The reaction
mechanism of SMR on Ru is investigated using first principles calculations
based on DFT-D2. We found that methane activation (i.e., C–H
bond cleavage) proceeds in a thermodynamically exothermic dissociative
adsorption resulting in CHy-species. C*
and CH* are the most stable surface-bound intermediates, making the
surface vulnerable to carbon formation that can lead to experimentally
reported catalyst deactivation. The conversion of C into O-containing
species is found to require a relatively high activation barrier,
suggesting a slow kinetics for C–O bond formation. The overall
reaction is determined by whether carbon forms stable structures on
the surface that deactivates the catalyst or undergoes activated conversion
into O-containing species. These findings pose significant insights
into the design of catalysts for SMR.
