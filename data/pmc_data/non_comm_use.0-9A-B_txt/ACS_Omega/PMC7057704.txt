A combination
of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) with semiconductor
photocatalysts, called plasmonic photocatalysts, can be a good candidate
for highly efficient photocatalysts using broadband solar light because
it can greatly enhance overall photocatalytic efficiency by extending
the working wavelength range of light from ultraviolet (UV) to visible.
In particular, fixation of plasmonic photocatalysts on a floating
porous substrate can have additional advantages for their recycling
after water treatment. Here, we report on a floating porous plasmonic
photocatalyst based on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–TiO2–gold (Au) composite sponge, in which TiO2 and Au NPs are simultaneously immobilized on the surface of interconnected
pores in the PDMS sponge. This can be easily fabricated by a simple
sugar-template method with TiO2 NPs and in situ reduction
of Au NPs by the PDMS without extra chemicals. Its ability to decompose
the organic pollutant rhodamine B in water was tested under UV and
visible light, respectively. The results showed highly enhanced photocatalytic
activity under both UV and visible light compared to the PDMS–TiO2 sponge and the PDMS–Au sponge. Furthermore, its recyclability
was also demonstrated for multiple cycles. The simplicity of fabrication
and high photocatalytic performance of our PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge can be promising in environmental applications
to treat water pollution.

1 Introduction
Semiconductor-based
photocatalysts can absorb photons to generate
electron–hole pairs that can be used for the oxidation or reduction
of materials on a photocatalyst surface.1,2 This property
has caused intensive research into photocatalysts for their possible
applications in the fields of environmental purification3,4 and sustainable energy such as water splitting.5 Among others, TiO2 has been the most studied
material owing to its abundance, low price, nontoxicity, high chemical
stability, and high photoactivity.1,6,7 However, one significant obstacle to the real application
of TiO2 is its large band gap energy, owing to which it
can absorb only ultraviolet (UV) light with wavelengths of less than
400 nm, which is a very minor portion of the solar spectrum.8 This significantly limits the efficiency of TiO2 in applications that use solar light.

There have been
many efforts to extend the absorption wavelength
range of TiO2-based photocatalysts to visible light, such
as hydrogenation to make black TiO2 and the incorporation
of metal or nonmetal impurities.3,9−13 However, despite a broadened absorption wavelength range, many of
these techniques also suffer from a higher recombination rate of generated
electron–hole pairs by an increased number of defect sites
inside the TiO2.14

Recently,
plasmonic photocatalysis, based on a combination of noble
metal nanoparticles (NPs) and TiO2, has been investigated
as a new strategy for the development of visible-light-active photocatalysts.14−16 Noble metals such as gold (Au) NPs can strongly absorb visible light
by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is a collective
oscillation of electrons at the surface. LSPR can induce highly energetic
electrons by light absorption, which can be injected into a neighboring
TiO2 matrix.16,17 This can greatly enhance
the photocatalytic activity in visible light.

Many different
methods have been applied to make various types
of Au NP-loaded TiO2 systems: the adsorption of preformed
Au colloid NPs on TiO2 NPs,18,19 thermal annealing
of deposited Au film to make embedded Au NPs inside a TiO2 matrix,20 UV photoreduction21 or chemical reduction of Au precursor on the
surface of TiO2 NPs,22 and so
on. A NP type of TiO2 system can have a large surface area
for catalytic reactions. In addition, a small size is advantageous
to reduce the recombination of electron–hole pairs before their
migration to the surface. However, in the case of the free suspension
of TiO2 NPs for water purification, it is very difficult
to re-collect TiO2 NPs for recycling after treatment. On
the other hand, a film type of TiO2 system has a limited
surface area to encounter materials to be decomposed and a higher
recombination rate owing to the greater size, despite being easier
to recycle than a NP type of TiO2.

Immobilizing TiO2 NPs on a porous solid substrate is
one method to enhance both efficiency and recyclability. In particular,
the loading of TiO2 NPs on floating porous substrates has
another advantage for water purification utilizing sunlight, which
generally shines on the solution from above, when considering a limited
light penetration depth underwater.23 Among
various floating porous substrates, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
sponge is a very promising material.24 It
is chemically inert and biocompatible. Its hydrophobicity facilitates
the absorption of hydrophobic organic molecules from water.25,26 It can be easily fabricated by a simple method using a sugar cube
as a template without using any toxic chemicals.27 There have been several promising results from recent studies
on the PDMS–TiO2 composite sponge for photocatalytic
application.28−30

In addition to the abovementioned advantages,
PDMS has another
important property that can be advantageous in loading Au NPs on a
PDMS surface: PDMS can directly reduce Au-ion precursors to Au NPs
without using any chemical reductant owing to the reducing power of
the PDMS curing agent itself.31,32 This can be very useful
in fabricating PDMS–Au composite materials for plasmonic application.

Here, we report on a floating porous plasmonic photocatalyst based
on the PDMS–TiO2–Au composite sponge. Colloidal
TiO2 NPs were embedded in the PDMS sponge pore interface,
and then Au NPs were directly reduced from the Au precursor at the
PDMS sponge pore interface. The high loading density of Au NPs and
TiO2 NPs in a small confined space on the pore interface
increases the probability of their close contact, which is required
for the plasmonic photocatalytic effect. In addition, the high adsorption
capacity of porous structures allows target organic molecules to be
effectively located near the Au and TiO2 NPs attached to
the pore surface.

This type of fabrication is simpler than the
loading of presynthesized
TiO2–Au hybrid NPs on the PDMS sponge because it
can skip extra chemical or photoreduction processes to form Au NPs
on the surface of TiO2 NPs in solution by using the PDMS
sponge as the template as well as the reducing agent. In this work,
for the first time, we demonstrated the enhanced photocatalytic effect
of the PDMS–TiO2–Au composite sponge under
visible light as well as UV light, compared to the PDMS–TiO2 and the PDMS–Au sponges. Although the fabrication
of the PDMS–TiO2–noble metal composite sponge
itself has been introduced previously in other papers, it mostly focused
on the usage of noble metal NPs as the surface-enhanced Raman scattering
probes to identify the kind of chemicals, rather than as the plasmonic
photocatalyst to enhance the decomposition of chemicals.30 The high photocatalytic activity of the PDMS–TiO2–Au composite sponge for a large wavelength range from
UV to visible light should be very helpful in applications that use
broadband solar light.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of a PDMS–TiO2–Au
Sponge
A PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge was fabricated following the process shown in Scheme 1 (for details, see the Experimental Methods). In this process, TiO2 NPs are embedded in the PDMS pore interface with a section
of the TiO2 surface exposed for direct contact with the
solution phase. Owing to the stability of TiO2 NPs, the
PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge can maintain its photocatalytic
activity under multiple reuses, which will be shown in the recyclability
test result.

Scheme 1 Fabrication of a PDMS–TiO2–Au
Sponge
Additionally, Au NPs can be
directly reduced from the HAuCl4 precursor by the reducing
ability of the residual curing
agent of PDMS, which can be identified by a color change of the sponge
from yellow (the color of HAuCl4 precursor) to violet.
The reducing ability of PDMS was reported in previous studies.31,32 Whereas no additional chemical reducing agent was used, the residual
Si–H groups of the PDMS matrix themselves can act as agents
to reduce Au NPs from the HAuCl4 precursor. The reducing
ability of PDMS can be maintained after being cured to solid PDMS
if there remain residual Si–H groups in the PDMS matrix.31,32 By using this property, a HAuCl4 precursor was added
after the PDMS sponge was cured instead of mixing it with liquid PDMS
precursor in advance. This method has an advantage over the premixing
of HAuCl4 precursor with liquid PDMS, which is more common
in other studies,30,33 because reduced Au NPs will be
preferentially located at the pore interface rather than distributed
inside the PDMS matrix. The preferential location of Au NPs on the
pore interface increases the probability of Au NPs contacting TiO2 NPs, which is required for plasmonic photocatalysis.

The porous structure of the PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge and the distribution of TiO2 and Au NPs can be observed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). The SEM images in Figure 1 show the cross section of a PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge that has been cut to a thickness of 1 mm to reveal
its internal structure. The PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge consists of pores between 90 and 900 μm, corresponding
to the size of sugar particles, which are interconnected.

Figure 1 SEM images
and corresponding EDS spectra of the (a) cross section
of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge. (b,d) Area corresponding
to the pore/air interface shows attached NPs, whereas the (c,e) area
corresponding to the PDMS matrix shows no presence of NPs.

TiO2 NPs are observed at the pore/air interface
(Figure 1b), with TiO2 NPs not observed within the PDMS matrix (Figure 1c). Although Au NPs were not
identified in the SEM images, the existence of both TiO2 and Au NPs at the pore/air interface, not inside the PDMS matrix,
was confirmed by the presence of Ti and Au peaks in the energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of those areas (Figure 1b,d). In EDS analysis, the Au peak is shown
to partially overlap with the Pt peak, with Pt used to coat samples
for SEM and EDS measurement in this work; the enlarged EDS spectrum
was used to distinguish between the two peaks and shows the existence
of Au at the pore/air interface (Figure S2). These results indicate that TiO2 and Au NPs are preferentially
located at the pore interface rather than inside the PDMS matrix,
which is beneficial for the photocatalytic reaction.

To confirm
the attachment of Au NPs to the surface of TiO2 NPs, necessary
for the synergistic plasmonic photocatalytic effect,
thin slices of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge, which
are sectioned by the ultra-microtome after filling LR-White resin
into its pores, were imaged by TEM (Figure 2). The high-resolution TEM images show the
presence of Au NPs attached to the surface of TiO2 NPs,
which can induce the plasmonic photocatalytic effect. The reduced
Au NPs are mostly spherical with sizes from 3 to 15 nm (Figures 2a and S3). The interplanar spacing of 2.01 and 3.47 Å correspond
to the (200) and (101) lattice planes of Au and TiO2, respectively
(Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a) TEM images
of the ultra-microtome sample of the PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge. Au NPs are indicated by the red arrows.
(b) High-resolution TEM image of the Au NP attached to the surface
of the TiO2 NP with their interplanar spacing indicated.

Au NPs in this size range can show LSPR properties
under visible
light irradiation. To identify an LSPR peak from Au NPs, the diffuse
reflectance spectra (DRS) of the PDMS–NP sponges were measured
(Figure 3). The PDMS
sponge shows negligible absorption for wavelengths larger than 350
nm. In the case of the PDMS–TiO2 sponge, strong
absorption is observed for wavelengths less than 400 nm, which is
characteristic of TiO2 NPs (Figure S4). Furthermore, the PDMS–Au sponge shows a peak in
the visible region (∼530 nm) corresponding to the typical LSPR
peak of Au NPs, indicating the formation of Au NPs.

Figure 3 UV–vis DRS of
PDMS sponge, PDMS–TiO2 sponge,
PDMS–Au sponge, and PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge.

In the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge,
the characteristic
absorption of both TiO2 and Au NPs was observed. The sudden
increase in absorption for wavelengths less than 400 nm is attributed
to the TiO2 NPs, whereas a peak at approximately 550 nm
is attributed to the LSPR of the Au NPs. The red shift of the LSPR
peak of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge compared
to that of the PDMS–Au sponge is related to the attachment
of Au NPs on the surface of TiO2 NPs that have higher refractive
index than PDMS. This also demonstrates the close contact of Au NPs
to the surface of TiO2 NPs in the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge.

2.2 Photocatalytic Decomposition
of Organic Dyes
The rhodamine B (RB) concentration is proportional
to its absorbance;
therefore, in order to track the changes in RB concentration (C/Co), the changes in the absorption
peak value at 550 nm were observed during its photocatalytic decomposition.
The RB decomposition under UV (365 nm) and visible (513 nm) light
irradiation by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) without any PDMS sponge
was negligible for the LED intensity used in this experiment.

2.2.1 PDMS Sponge
As a control experiment,
a pure PDMS sponge without TiO2 or Au NPs was tested to
see if it can decompose RB. Under dark, UV, and visible light conditions,
the absorption spectra of the RB solution did not change for 6 h except
for a 5–10% decrease during the initial wetting process of
the PDMS sponge (Figure S5). As the amount
of initial RB absorption by the PDMS pores is dependent on the porous
volume of the PDMS sponge, it can slightly vary from sample to sample.
Thus, for a proper comparison of decomposition rates, the RB concentration
value was normalized by its value measured at the start of light irradiation
(C/Co) and plotted. Therefore,
in the horizontal axes of the plots, time zero indicates the start
of light irradiation at which the C/Co value was set to 1 for all conditions.

2.2.2 PDMS–TiO2 Sponge
With the PDMS–TiO2 sponge, the RB concentration
significantly decreased under UV light, whereas it was near constant
under dark and visible light conditions (Figure 4a). This is consistent with the photocatalytic
property of TiO2 that is active only for UV light.34 Moreover, it shows that TiO2 NPs
are not completely embedded in the PDMS sponge but are exposed to
the RB solution as expected. The catalytic reaction would not occur
unless the surface of the TiO2 NPs is exposed when embedded
in the PDMS matrix.

Figure 4 Relative RB concentration (initially, 20 μM) change,
monitored
by the change in RB absorption peak value with time in the presence
of (a) PDMS–TiO2, (b) PDMS–Au, and (c) PDMS–TiO2–Au sponges under dark, UV (365 nm), and visible (513
nm) light conditions, respectively. (d) Three data sets plotted on
one graph for comparison.

The decomposition of RB can be described by the following well-known
mechanism.

When photons are absorbed by TiO2, electron
and hole
pairs can be generated inside TiO2 1   2   3   4   5  Here, TiO2* is the excited state of TiO2, eCB– is a photoexcited electron in the conduction
band, hVB+ is a photogenerated hole in the valence
band, OH• is a hydroxyl radical, OHad– is an adsorbed hydroxide ion, and O2•– is a superoxide. The abovementioned active
species are strong oxidants and contribute to the photocatalytic decomposition
of RB. However, no photocatalytic effect can be observed under visible
light irradiation because the photon energy is not sufficient to overcome
the band gap of TiO2.

Light scattering by PDMS pores
themselves will not affect the RB
decomposition rate significantly, because PDMS pores scatter rather
than absorb light and multiple light scattering events at pores can
result in a homogeneous distribution of light intensity over the entire
PDMS sponge. Thus, scattered light inside the PDMS can be substantially
absorbed by TiO2 before escaping from the PDMS sponge.

2.2.3 PDMS–Au Sponge
Interestingly,
RB decomposed even in dark conditions, although this was significantly
slower than under light for the PDMS–Au sponge (Figure 4b). This can be attributed
to the catalytic, not photocatalytic, activity of the Au NPs. It is
known that Au NPs of less than 5 nm in diameter can be catalytically
active for several chemical reactions.35 As Au NPs reduced by the PDMS sponge have various sizes, as shown
in the TEM images (Figure S3), with some
Au NPs less than 5 nm, they are expected to contribute to the catalytic
reaction even in dark conditions. However, this is considerably less
efficient than the photocatalytic reaction.

Under UV and visible
light, RB decomposed faster than under dark conditions. In particular,
the RB decomposition rate under visible light was higher than under
UV light. Previously, it was shown that the catalytic activity of
Au NPs can be greatly enhanced by hot electrons that can decay from
surface plasmons excited in Au NPs by light.36−38 In this case,
Au NPs larger than 5 nm can show photocatalytic activity if they demonstrate
LSPR. Therefore, a larger number of Au NPs can contribute to the photocatalytic
reaction than those under dark conditions, which can be an additional
contribution to the decomposition of RB under light. The faster decomposition
rate of RB under visible light than under UV light can also be understood
in terms of a hot-electron-mediated photocatalytic reaction because
Au NPs have maximal LSPR efficiency in visible light.

The RB
dye can decompose either by an indirect pathway through
the reaction with strong oxidants, which can be photocatalytically
generated from water at the surface of Au NPs, or by a direct pathway
in which the RB dye adsorbed to the surface of Au NPs can decompose.
As the RB dye contains four N-ethyl groups on both sides of the xanthene
moiety, it adsorbs on the surface of Au NPs through electrostatic
interaction.38−40

2.2.4 PDMS–TiO2–Au Sponge
Under dark conditions, RB decomposed at
a rate similar to that
of the PDMS–Au sponge (Figure 4c). This demonstrates that the catalytic activity under
dark conditions must originate from Au NPs and not TiO2 NPs, as previously expected.

Under UV light, the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge showed a 1.8 times faster RB decomposition
rate than the PDMS–TiO2 sponge, and a 7.4 times
faster rate than the PDMS–Au sponge (Figure S6). If TiO2 and Au NPs independently contribute
to RB decomposition, then the RB decomposition rate of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge should be similar to the addition of rates
of the PDMS–TiO2 sponge and the PDMS–Au sponge.
However, the experimentally measured RB decomposition rate of the
PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge was greater than the
simple addition of the rates of the other two sponges. This suggests
a synergistic effect between TiO2 and Au NPs for photocatalysis.

This enhanced photocatalytic effect is expected to come from TiO2 NPs directly contacting Au NPs. When Au NPs are reduced from
HAuCl4 in the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge,
they can randomly form over the surface of the pores, with some forming
close to TiO2 NPs partly embedded in the surface of PDMS
pores (Figure 2). At
the interface of TiO2 and Au NPs, a Schottky junction is
formed, which builds up an internal electric field (the space-charge
region) inside TiO2 NPs.16 As
this internal electric field in TiO2 can reduce the recombination
rate of generated electrons and holes by pushing them in different
directions, the photocatalytic efficiency of contacting TiO2 and Au NPs can be enhanced compared to TiO2 NPs alone.
This is likely responsible for the higher RB decomposition rate of
the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge than the PDMS–TiO2 sponge under UV light.

A more impressive characteristic
of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge is its photocatalytic
efficiency under visible
light. It shows a high RB decomposition rate under visible light,
which is comparable to that under UV light. This is unexpected when
considering the almost negligible (110 times slower) RB decomposition
rate in the PDMS–TiO2 sponge and mild (4.7 times
slower) RB decomposition rate in the PDMS–Au sponge under visible
light (Figure S6). It is speculated that
the enhancement in the photocatalytic efficiency of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge under visible light is related to the synergistic
property of TiO2 and Au NPs contacting each other, which
is similar to the UV case.

The Schottky junction effect can
work under visible light irradiation
as well. However, under visible light, another advantage based on
the LSPR effect of Au NPs can play an important role in enhancing
photocatalytic efficiency.16 Visible light
can excite surface plasmons on Au NPs, which can nonradiatively decay
into hot electrons. These hot electrons generated at Au NPs can be
used directly for the catalysis of molecules adsorbed on the Au NP
surface as in the PDMS–Au sponge case,36 or can be injected into the conduction band of contacting TiO2 NPs to generate another electron–hole pair.17,18,20 By the latter mechanism, the
electron–hole pair, necessary for catalysis, can be generated
in TiO2 even under visible light, despite the photon energy
being insufficient to directly overcome the band gap of TiO2.

To check the possible contribution of the RB sensitization
effect
on the high RB decomposition rate under visible (513 nm) light, the
decomposition of methylene blue (MB) with the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge was investigated under the same light conditions
(Figure S7). As the absorption band of
MB that peaks at 664 nm is far from 513 nm, the dye sensitization
effect can be excluded in the MB decomposition under the 513 nm light.
The MB dye showed significant decomposition under 513 nm light, which
shows that the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge has photocatalytic
activity under visible light even without the photosensitization effect.
We believe that the LSPR effect of the Au NPs is responsible for the
high photocatalytic activity of the PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge.

However, it should be noted that the RB decomposition
rate under
visible light with the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge
was comparable to that under UV light, whereas the MB decomposition
rate under visible light was approximately two times lower than under
UV light. This indicates that the photosensitization effect also contributes
to the photocatalytic dye decomposition of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge. However, the negligible decomposition of
RB under visible light in the case of the PDMS–TiO2 sponge indicates that the dye photosensitization effect under our
experimental conditions is insignificant without Au NPs. Therefore,
the fast RB decomposition with the PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge under visible light is mostly attributed to the LSPR effect
of Au NPs.

Furthermore, the hypsochromic shift of the absorption
peak observed
during the RB decomposition with the PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge, under both UV and visible light, indicates the formation of
N-de-ethylated intermediates (Figure S8).39,41−43 It has been reported
in literature that the N-de-ethylation of RB can selectively occur
depending on the adsorption state of RB on the TiO2, but
the case for RB with hybrid TiO2–Au NPs has not
been studied well. A more detailed study on the hypsochromic peak
shift would be beneficial for understanding the adsorption state of
RB on the hybrid TiO2–Au NPs.

Extending the
absorption wavelength range from UV to visible can
be beneficial for photocatalysis using solar light because visible
light accounts for a larger portion of the solar spectrum than UV
light. Therefore, the effective use of both UV and visible light for
photocatalysis can significantly enhance photocatalytic efficiency
under solar light.

2.3 Recyclability Test
In practical applications,
maintaining photocatalytic efficiency for multiple usages is an important
performance criterion. To test the recyclability of our PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge, its efficiency for RB decomposition was
monitored for four cycles (Figure 5). The PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge
was washed with deionized water several times between each cycle.
A similar RB decomposition rate for all four cycles indicates that
our PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge can be repeatedly
used at least four times. It also indicates that the TiO2 and Au NPs in the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge attach
quite strongly to the surface of PDMS pores. This is due to the partial
embedding of TiO2 on the pore interface of PDMS and the
direct reduction of Au NPs during fabrication rather than postphysical
adsorption. To further confirm that TiO2 and Au NPs are
not released from the PDMS sponge with time, the extinction spectrum
change of water solution in the presence of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge was monitored, but no change was observed
for over 3 h (Figure S9). This indicates
that TiO2 and Au NPs are not detached from the PDMS matrix
during normal photocatalytic reaction.

PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge

3 Conclusions
A floating, porous plasmonic
photocatalyst consisting of TiO2 and Au NPs immobilized
on the surface of PDMS sponge pores
was prepared by using a facile sugar-template method. The photocatalytic
efficiency under UV and visible light was studied by monitoring the
RB decomposition rate under each condition. The PDMS–TiO2–Au composite sponge showed significantly higher photocatalytic
efficiency than the PDMS–TiO2 or PDMS–Au
sponges under UV and visible light. In particular, the enhancement
of the photocatalytic efficiency under visible light was remarkable,
and is expected to originate from hot-electron injection by LSPR and
the Schottky junction effect. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the
PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge is stable enough to be
recycled several times. Owing to its high photocatalytic performance
and simple fabrication, the PDMS–TiO2–Au
sponge is a promising material for solar light-based wastewater treatment.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Fabrication of PDMS Sponge,
PDMS–TiO2 Sponge, and PDMS–TiO2–Au Sponge
A PDMS sponge was fabricated using a sacrificial
sugar cube template
method (Scheme 1).27 A 10:1 ratio mixture of PDMS prepolymer (Sylgard
184 A, Dow Corning, 15 g) and curing agent (Sylgard 184 B, Dow Corning,
1.5 g) was placed in a Petri dish and degassed in a vacuum chamber
for 30 min to get rid of air bubbles. A sugar cube (CJ CheilJedang)
was added to the PDMS precursor and then placed under vacuum for an
additional 2 h. The empty pores of the sugar cube were filled with
PDMS precursor by the capillary force. The filled sugar cube was placed
in a convection oven at 60 °C and cured for 6 h. After curing,
the sugar was removed by dissolving in water, leaving a PDMS sponge.
The remaining water in the PDMS sponge was removed by drying in the
convection oven.

To make a PDMS–TiO2 sponge,
first, TiO2 NPs (15 nm, anatase, Nanostructured & Amorphous
Materials, Inc.) were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol to make a 4.7%
(w/v) solution. This was sonicated for 30 min. Then, 800 μL
of TiO2 NP solution in ethanol was injected into the sugar
cube to decorate porous interfaces of the sugar cube with TiO2 NPs. This TiO2-containing sugar cube was used
to absorb the PDMS precursor under vacuum for 8 h to make a PDMS–TiO2 sponge. Because TiO2 NPs are initially located
at the sugar/PDMS precursor interface and the PDMS precursor cannot
penetrate into the sugar crystal, the TiO2 NPs after the
curing of PDMS and washing out of sugar will be exclusively located,
and partly embedded, at the porous interface of the PDMS sponge.30 Partial embedding of TiO2 NPs at
the PDMS pore interface provides the stability (by the strong attachment
on the PDMS matrix) and activity (by exposure of the uncovered TiO2 surface) of TiO2 NPs. The detailed procedure is
similar to the above method to prepare the PDMS sponge. The TiO2 NPs lost during the sugar washing step was measured through
the weight change. It was seen that 98% of the initial TiO2 NPs (totally, 37 mg of TiO2 per sponge) still remained
in the PDMS sponge, indicating that TiO2 NPs were strongly
attached to the PDMS pore interface.

To make a PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge, 0.25% (w/v)
of HAuCl4·3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) in anhydrous
ethanol was prepared as the precursor solution for Au NPs. Then, a
1.5 mL solution of HAuCl4 precursor was injected into the
preformed PDMS–TiO2 sponge and incubated in a convection
oven at 60 °C for 6 h. Au NPs can be directly reduced from HAuCl4 precursor by the reducing ability of the residual curing
agent of PDMS, as reported in previous studies.31,32 By injecting the HAuCl4 precursor solution into the pores
of the preformed PDMS sponge, rather than forming the PDMS sponge
from the mixture of HAuCl4 and liquid PDMS precursor, Au
NPs can be located mostly on the pore interface rather than inside
the PDMS matrix. This can be advantageous in plasmonic photocatalytic
applications when compared with the previous PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge preparation method that uses an initial mixture
of metal precursor and liquid PDMS before curing,30 because our method can increase the probability of contact
between TiO2 NPs and Au NPs by attaching both of them at
the pore interface, not inside the PDMS matrix. Furthermore, to make
a PDMS–Au sponge, a PDMS sponge was used to reduce the Au NPs
instead of a PDMS–TiO2 sponge. The Au NPs formed
at the PDMS pore interface were hardly released from the PDMS sponge,
which was confirmed from the negligible absorption change of water
containing the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge for several
hours (Figure S9). From this, it is known
that a total of 1.9 mg of Au NPs were loaded on the PDMS–TiO2–Au or PDMS–Au sponges.

4.2 Structural
and Optical Characterization of
PDMS–NP Composite Sponges
The structure and morphology
of the prepared sponges were investigated using SEM (Hitachi S-4700)
after platinum coating, and their elemental composition was analyzed
by EDS (HORIBA 7200-H). The DRS of the PDMS–NP composite sponges
were measured by the spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450). For TEM
images, the samples were embedded in LR-White resin (London Resin
Co., London, UK) at 50 °C for 24 h, from which ultrathin sections
(80–100 nm thickness) were prepared using an ultra-microtome
with a diamond knife. Then, the sections were mounted on a copper
grid and examined using TEM (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, FEI).

4.3 Monitoring Degradation of RB by Photocatalytic
Reaction
The experimental setup to monitor the photocatalytic
degradation of RB (Sigma-Aldrich) consists of a quartz cuvette holder
(Thorlabs, CVH100/M) connected to a halogen light source (Ocean Optics,
HL-2000) and a spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB 4000-VIS-NIR-ES) by
optical fibers to measure the absorption spectra of RB in solution.
Collimated LED light sources are incident on the quartz cuvette from
above at a specific wavelength of light for photocatalysis. The UV
LED (Thorlabs, M365L2-C1) emits light from 354 to 385 nm with a peak
intensity at 365 nm. The green visible LED (Thorlabs, M530L3-C1) emits
light from 484 to 562 nm with a peak intensity at 513 nm. The spectra
of all LEDs are shown in Figure S1. The
light from the LED was focused on the surface of the photocatalytic
PDMS sponges at a power of 20 mW for both LEDs. During measurement,
the solution was continuously mixed by a magnetic stirrer. The peak
value at 550 nm in the absorption spectrum of RB was used to estimate
the time-dependent changes in the RB concentration under each condition.

A photocatalytic PDMS sponge in the shape of a 9 mm × 9 mm
× 9 mm cube was immersed in 3 mL of 20 μM RB aqueous solution
in a quartz cuvette. Before starting measurement, the PDMS sponge
was squeezed several times with tweezers to wet its pores. Then, the
PDMS sponge was floated in the upper part of the RB solution. Once
the pores in the PDMS sponge are filled with water, molecules dispersed
in water can easily diffuse between the inside and outside of the
pores. Prior to light irradiation, the RB solution containing the
PDMS sponge sample was placed in the dark for 2 h to allow the dye
and sample to reach adsorption-equilibrium. This process is useful
to compare solely the photocatalytic activity of different hybrid
sponges by eliminating the contribution of the initial RB adsorption
on the PDMS pore surface, because the initial RB adsorption capacity
of each sponge can be more dependent on the pore distribution of the
PDMS sponge, which is difficult to exactly control with our fabrication
method, than the properties of the NPs.

4.4 Recyclability
Test
To test the recyclability
of the PDMS–TiO2–Au sponge, after finishing
the first photocatalytic measurement, it was separated from the previous
RB solution, squeezed several times in distilled water for washing,
and completely dried in a convection oven. Then, it was used again
for a second photocatalytic measurement in fresh RB solution. All
processes were the same as those in the first measurement. The measurements
were repeated four times.
