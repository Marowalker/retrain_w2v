Two
types of carbon fibers with a large diameter of ∼22
μm, derived from unstirred and vigorously stirred mesophase
pitch melts with different liquid crystalline mesophase textures,
were prepared by melt-spinning, stabilization, carbonization, and
graphitization treatments. The morphology, microstructure, and physical
properties of the carbon fibers derived from the two kinds of mesophase
precursors after various processes were characterized in detail. The
results show that the optical texture (i.e., size and orientation)
of the liquid crystalline mesophase in the molten pitch is obviously
modified by thermomechanical stirring treatment, which has a significant
effect on the texture of as-spun pitch fibers, and finally dominates
the microstructure and physical properties of the resulting carbon
and graphite fibers. These large-diameter fibers expectedly maintain
their morphological and structural integrity and effectively avoid
shrinkage cracking during subsequent high-temperature heat treatment
processes, in contrast to those derived from the unstirred pitch.
This is due to the smaller crystallite sizes and lower orientation
of graphene layers in the former. The tensile strength and axial electrical
resistivity of the 3000 °C-graphitized large fibers derived from
the unstirred pitch are about 1.8 GPa and 1.18 μΩ m, respectively.
In contrast, upon melt stirring treatment of the pitch before spinning,
the resulting large-diameter graphite fibers possess the corresponding
values of 1.3 GPa and 1.86 μΩ m. Despite the acceptable
decrease of mechanical properties and axial electrical and thermal
conduction performance, the latter possesses relatively high mechanical
stability (i.e., low strength deviation) and ideal morphological and
structural integrity, which is beneficial for the wide applications
in composites.

1 Introduction
Mesophase pitch-based
carbon fibers have the potential to attain
moduli values up to the theoretical modulus of graphite, 1000 GPa,
merely by high-temperature heat treatment and have higher axial electrical
(as low as 1.1 μΩ m) and thermal conductivities (exceeding
1000 W/m K; cf. carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile or rayon).1−3 All these overwhelming factors make them particularly suitable for
many critical aviation and aerospace applications. It is known that
the macroscopic properties of carbon fibers are determined by their
microstructure and there is great potential to tailor their structure
during the liquid crystalline phase of the synthesis process4 because the structure and properties of carbon
(and hence graphite) fibers have a close relationship to those of
their pitch fiber precursors.1,5 For example, the smaller
the diameter of a pitch fiber, the higher the tensile strength of
the resulting carbon fiber, and the performance of the carbon fiber
from the pitch fiber with a concentric “onion” structure
is better than that from a radial structure. To obtain such promising
fibers, it is necessary to modify the structure and property of the
pitch precursor, change the shape and structure of the spinneret,
and adjust the spinning conditions (e.g., extrude temperatures).1,5−7 However, controllably preparing such onion-textured
carbon fibers is currently still very difficult.

It is well
demonstrated that radial-textured round carbon fibers
are prone to split-forming an open wedge-shaped “Pac-man”
cross-sectional configuration during a high-temperature heat treatment
processes.7−10 This will undoubtedly affect their final physical properties (e.g.,
variable strength distribution) and limit their potential application
for high volume fraction packing, for example, in composites. Many
studies have been performed to control or eliminate the crack splitting
texture of carbon fibers to achieve an ideal structure and good physical
(mechanical or thermal conduction) performance. For instance, Hamada
et al. successfully disrupted the radial texture by the placement
of a mixer directly above the spinning nozzle to obtain textures from
random to quasi-onion.11 Mochida et al.
employed noncircular spinning nozzles and designed the geometries
of the spinnerets and aspects of the capillary to control the transversal
texture of round-shaped carbon fibers.9,12 Matsumoto
et al. used several types of nozzle and a fine-mesh filter to eliminate
crack generation along the fiber axis.13 Yao et al. adjusted the various components of the mesophase pitch
by blending some isotropic pitches14 and
adopted a mesh filter above the spinneret15 to tailor the microstructure and physical properties of carbon fibers.
In addition, some nano- or microsized carbon materials16,17 (e.g., carbon nanotubes, carbon black, and graphene) have been added
into the mesophase pitch to modify the structure and property of the
resultant carbon fibers.

In the previous research, agitating
the pitch melt directly above
the spinning nozzle requires very high seal performance for pumping
the melt out of the nozzle and may be unfavorable for continuous or
industrial spinning and homogeneous fiber texture owing to the incidence
of some bubbles and the instantaneous inhomogeneity of the pitch melt,
which will undoubtedly affect the final properties of carbon fibers.
In this work, it is very simple and effective to modify the rheological
structure (i.e., the microdomain size, arrangement, and orientation
of the liquid crystalline mesophase) of the pitch melt by vigorous
thermomechanical stirring treatment on a bulk mesophase pitch with
100% optically anisotropic content (that easily formed radial-cracked
carbon fibers in previous work, especially large-diameter fibers18) before melt-spinning. Furthermore, this work
provides a complete study to elucidate the effect of the liquid crystalline
mesophase texture on the microstructure and properties of the resulting
carbon fibers and, in particular, those with large diameters. Large-diameter
carbon fibers (Φ ∼22 μm) prepared from the unstirred
and stirred pitches are selected as a model to confirm the experimental
effect because large-diameter carbon fibers are more prone to split
during heat treatment processes.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Optical Texture of the
Pitch and Its Derivatives
The polarized-light micrographs
of the as-received, melted and
melt-stirred mesophase pitches are shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that the as-received pitch,
shown in Figure 1a,
b, possesses a streamline “fibrous” texture with high
orientation (i.e., an orderly liquid crystalline phase) visible via
orthogonal observation by rotating the object stage of the PLM. Following
melting and melt-stirred treatments at 320 °C as shown in Figure 1c, d, respectively,
the optical texture of the melting pitch is nearly maintained, and
the conformation and orientation of the macromolecules in the melt-stirred
pitch are disrupted to become partially disordered or turbulent (severely
deformed),19,20 depending upon the degree of
stirring. Nevertheless, the optically anisotropic content of the two
types of pitches is not changed, and the anisotropy and size of the
polydomain structure of the liquid crystalline mesophase reduced,
as expected, upon intensive stirring and shearing. Figure 2 shows typical PLM photographs
of the as-spun pitch fibers from as-received and melt-stirred mesophase
pitches. It can be clearly found that there is an obvious difference
in the distribution and size of isochromatic color regions (which
are in close relation to the orientation and size of the microcrystalline
domains within the resulting carbon fibers) in the transverse cross
sections of the respective as-spun pitch fibers. That is to say the
arrangement, orientation, and distribution of the liquid crystalline
mesophase in the as-spun fibers are disturbed by changing the rheological
texture of the pitch precursor. Vigorous melt-stirring significantly
homogenizes the initial anisotropic texture of the mesophase pitch
and its derivative pitch fibers. As a necessary supplement, the typical
PLM photographs of 900 °C-carbonized coke derived from the as-received
and melt-stirred mesophase pitches are shown in Figure 3, which further demonstrate the two clearly
different microstructures varying from a well-oriented texture to
a supramosaic texture owing to the textural variety of mesophase pitches.

2.2 Morphology
and Microstructures of the Derivative
Carbon Fibers
Figures 4 and 5 show SEM images of the
typical transverse cross sections of these carbon fibers heat-treated
at various temperatures. The great majority of carbonized and graphitized
fibers derived from the unstirred pitch exhibit radial open cracks
as shown in Figure 4a–c, which show a typical “Pac-man” splitting
texture. The carbon layers in the transverse cross section of large
fibers radiate from the center to the surface like spokes in a wheel
as shown in Figure 5a–c, in a similar fashion to the well-known K-1100 graphite
fibers.21 The highly preferred orientation
of carbon layers running along the axial direction of the fiber is
clearly observed in Figure 5b, c. The larger the diameter of the pitch fibers, the higher
the degree of resultant carbon (graphite) fiber splitting in terms
of both crack volume in the fiber bundle and crack angle of the single
fiber.22 The degree of splitting (opening
angle) of large-diameter carbon fibers is obviously aggravated with
an increase of heat treatment temperature (HTT). This is caused by
internal stresses within such highly anisotropic materials because
of the directional growth and preferred orientation of graphite microcrystallites
in the fiber. That is to say, this is caused by the limited growth
of graphite crystals in a fibrous narrow space. However, the splitting
of the fibers enables the graphene layers to pack and register more
perfectly, which will result in a higher modulus and electrical and
thermal conductivity in the fiber axial direction.23

Figure 4 Typical SEM images of carbon fibers derived from the (a–c)
unstirred and (d–f) stirred pitches after heat treatment at
(a, d) 1000, (b, e) 2000, and (c, f) 3000 °C.

fibers derived from the (a–c) unstirred and (d–f) stirred
pitches after heat treatment at (a, d) 1000, (b, e) 2000, (c, f) 3000
°C.

In contrast, no obvious cracks
can be observed in the transverse
sections of the carbon fibers derived from the stirred pitch as shown
in Figures 4d–f
and 5d–f. These carbon fibers exhibit
typical random (or radial-folded, disturbed) textures and avoid shrinkage
cracking during heat treatment processes, which is similar to the
random structure of general-grade isotropic-pitch-based carbon fibers5 and some small-diameter carbon fibers in previous
work.22 The bent, twisted, or wavy carbon
layers and small microcrystal domains within these carbon fibers exhibiting
a relatively low anisotropic degree (i.e. high isotropy) are inherited
from the disordered and chaotic liquid crystalline texture in the
pitch precursor, which may be disadvantageous to the free growth of
microcrystal graphite or graphene layer and the closely related electrical
and thermal transport properties, but can effectively prohibit the
occurrence and propagation of fiber cracks because the shrinkage deformation
and structural evolution of these fibers during heat treatment processing
are relatively uniform so as to preserve morphological and structural
integrity, which will improve their homogeneity in terms of both structure
and properties.

As a supplementary experiment, the slightly
melt-stirred mesophase
pitch pretreated at about 320 °C for 1 h (the agitating speed
was fixed) was used to prepare the 3000 °C-graphitized large
fibers. A typical irregular-radial or radial-folded texture on the
transverse sections of carbon fibers is clearly shown in Figure 6. These graphite
fibers also possess a complete circular morphology instead of a “Pac-man”
splitting texture.

Figure 6 Typical SEM images of the transverse sections of the large
carbon
fibers derived from the slightly stirred pitch after heat treatment
at 3000 °C.

It can be concluded that
the microstructure of carbon fibers is
inherited from the rheological structure of their mesophase pitch
precursor, which can be varied to various extents by thermomechanical
treatment before melt-spinning as shown in Figure 7. In mesophase pitch fiber manufacture, the
molten liquid crystalline mesophase can be oriented within the spinneret
by shear treatment during a melt-spinning process. In general, the
shear forces involved result in a highly oriented structure, with
the mesophase domains elongated into cylinders parallel to the fiber
axis (circumferential fibers).20,24 Provided that these
shear forces are not sufficient to reorder the chaotic mesophase domains
within the melt-stirred molten pitch (as shown in Figure 1d) in a transient extrusion
process, various transversal textures, including radial, radial-folded,
and random, and even quasi-onion, can be produced in the cross-sections
of the resulting carbon fibers, which depends upon the chaotic degree
of the liquid crystalline mesophase.

from the mesophase pitch
precursor to the transverse texture-controlled carbon fibers as the
degree of melt-stirring increases.

2.3 XRD and Raman Analyses of the Derivative Carbon
Fibers
On the basis of XRD measurements, the microcrystalline
parameters and graphitization degree (g) of the two
types of carbon and graphite fibers heat-treated at various temperatures
are listed in Table 1. With the increasing HTT, the interlayer spacing (d002) of the carbon fibers obviously decreases, and the
microcrystalline parameters (the crystallite thickness Lc(002) and the crystallite length La(100)) and g values of the carbon fibers
significantly increase. For the fiber samples heat-treated at the
same temperature, the change of microcrystalline parameters of the
carbon fibers derived from the unstirred pitch is more obvious (possessing
larger crystal size and higher g value), which exhibits
a good graphitizability.

by the Scherrer equation L = Kλ/βcosθ.25

b g values were calculated
by the expression g = (0.3440 – d002 in nm)/(0.3440 – 0.3354).26

It can be found
that there is a small difference in the parameter
values for the fiber samples carbonized at 1000 °C. However,
the 3000 °C-graphitized large fibers derived from the unstirred
pitch possess larger crystal size, higher g, and
better crystalline orientation (strong and sharp (002) diffraction
peak, not shown), whereas the carbon fibers derived from the stirred
pitch exhibit smaller crystal size, lower g, and
poor crystalline orientation. The growth of graphite crystallites
within these fibers is severely inhibited owing to the severe curvature
and wrinkling of carbon layers or domains in these fibers. The XRD
analysis result is highly consistent with the SEM observation.

Figure 8 shows the
typical first-order Raman spectra of the two types of carbon fibers
heat-treated at various temperatures. The carbon fibers’ D
peak at about 1350 cm–1 and G peak at around 1580
cm–1 are both wide and intense, particularly at
low HTTs. With the increase of HTT, the D and G peaks of the carbon
fibers derived from the unstirred pitch as shown in Figure 5a become more sharp and symmetric,
and both the intensity of the D peak and the ID/IG ratio of the fibers sharply
decrease with the increase of HTT from 1000 to 3000 °C. This
indicates a marked decrease in structural defects and disordered carbon
concentrations in the final product and that the change from the turbostratic
structure to the graphite structure has occurred through high-temperature
heat treatment. It is interesting to note that the very weak D peak
of the fibers graphitized at 3000 °C as shown in Figure 8a is similar to that of stress-annealed
pyrolytic graphite,27 which further reveals
that a near-perfect crystal structure of graphite has formed in the
graphite fibers. However, the decrease of intensity of the D peak
and the ID/IG ratio of the carbon fibers derived from the stirred pitch as shown
in Figure 8b is not
as obvious as the former. The 3000 °C-graphitized fibers still
exhibit a relatively strong D peak, which is closely associated with
the disordered structure and small crystalline sizes inherited from
the chaotic texture of the liquid crystalline mesophase pitch. This
is in good agreement with the SEM and XRD measurements.

and (b) stirred pitches after heat treatment at various temperatures,

2.4 Physical Properties of the Derivative Carbon
Fibers
The tensile strength and Young’s modulus of
the two types of fibers after heat treatment at various temperatures
are shown in Figure 9. It can be clearly seen from the graphs shown in Figure 9a, b that the tensile strength
and Young’s modulus of the carbon and graphite fibers prepared
from the unstirred pitch are much higher than those of the fibers
derived from the stirred pitch as a result of the orientation, size,
and stacking of the graphene layers within the graphite fibers as
shown in their fracture surfaces (Figure 10). The microcrystal size, stacking thickness
of graphene layers, and degree of preferred orientation of the 3000
°C-graphitized fibers derived from the unstirred pitch are markedly
greater than those of the fibers derived from the stirred pitches,
resulting in an anticipated significant increases in the mechanical
property, which is in agreement with previous studies. However, the
dispersion and standard deviation values of tensile strength and modulus
of the carbon and graphite fibers derived from the unstirred pitch
are obviously larger than those of fibers obtained from the stirred
pitch, which may be closely associated with the “Pac-man”
splitting texture and microstructural disintegration of the former.
The deviation of the cracking direction or inhomogeneous cracks in
the fiber axis will cause a significant drop in the mechanical properties
of the carbon fibers; some may be catastrophic. It is interesting
to note that the tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the
3000 °C-graphitized large fibers with a radial-folded texture
(shown in Figure 6)
are measured to be as high as 1.6 and 420 GPa. It can be observed
that the tensile property of graphite fibers is mostly dominated by
the orientation and size of graphite crystallites as clearly shown
in the fracture sections and lattice fringe images. In comparison
with commercial mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers with a small diameter
of ∼10 μm, the mechanical properties of large-diameter
carbon fibers (strength: 1.3–1.8 GPa, modulus: 350–500
GPa) seem to be unsatisfactory,2 but their
axial electrical and thermal conduction properties are promising.28 As the heat treatment progresses, the mechanical
properties of these large fibers firstly increase, then decrease,
and finally increase again. It is unexpected that the mechanical properties
of these large fibers drop significantly upon heat treatment around
2000 °C. This may be due to the significant intrinsic structural
development and evolution (e.g., crystalline orientation/size change
and nanoscale flaws) taking place within the large-diameter fibers
at this temperature.1,29

modulus of carbon fibers

Figure 11 plots
the axial electrical resistivity values of the carbon fibers derived
from the unstirred and stirred pitches after heat treatment at various
temperatures. The error bars are not provided in the graph owing to
the relative low standard deviation (less than 5%) of both samples.
The axial electrical resistivities of both types of fiber significantly
decrease with the increase of HTT from 1000 to 3000 °C. There
is no obvious difference in the axial electrical resistivities for
the two types of 1000 °C-carbonized fibers. Upon further heat
treatment of the carbon fiber samples up to the graphitization temperature,
the axial electrical resistivities of the two kinds of large fibers
show obvious differences; the graphite fibers derived from the unstirred
pitch possess a lower axial electrical resistivity in comparison with
that of graphite fibers derived from the stirred pitch, which is closely
associated with the near-perfect crystal structure in the former as
demonstrated above. The axial room-temperature electrical resistivities
of the 3000 °C-graphitized fibers derived from the unstirred
and stirred pitches were measured to be as low as 1.18 and 1.86 μΩ
m, respectively. According to Lavin’s thermal–electrical
correlation,30 the axial room-temperature
thermal conductivities of these two types of large graphite fibers
are about 875 and 695 W m–1 K–1, respectively. These values are much higher than those of metallic
thermal conduction materials (e.g., Cu and Al). The thermal conduction
property is also closely related with the crystalline size and preferred
orientation of the carbon fibers, which is highly consistent with
the previous research results.22,31

3 Conclusions
This work clearly demonstrates
the effects of a liquid crystalline
mesophase texture in the pitch melts on the microstructure and physical
properties of the resulting large-diameter carbon and graphite fibers.
Thermomechanical stirring on the bulk mesophase pitch with high liquid
crystalline orientation is a simple and effective method to adjust
the structure and properties of mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers
for various applications (or choose a randomly oriented liquid crystalline
mesophase pitch as the precursor to directly prepare the desired carbon
fibers). In this system, the tensile strength, modulus, axial electrical
resistivity, and calculated thermal conductivity of the 3000 °C-graphitized
fibers with a large diameter of ∼22 μm can be tuned to
around 1.3–1.8 GPa, 350–500 GPa, 1.1–1.9 μΩ
m, and 700–880 W m–1 K–1, respectively, by modifying the liquid crystalline mesophase texture
of the pitch precursors. The rheological structure of the molten pitch
precursor strongly dictates the microstructure (crystallite size and
preferred orientation) of the resulting carbon fibers, which in turn
strongly influences the fibers’ final physical properties.
Carbon fibers derived from the stirred pitch possess smaller crystallite
sizes, lower crystallite orientation, and inferior mechanical and
transport properties in comparison with carbon fibers derived from
the unstirred pitch. However, they can maintain their circular transverse
cross section and prevent “Pac-man” splitting during
heat treatment processes, which is beneficial to the microstructural
homogeneity and mechanical stability (i.e., low strength deviation
and dispersion). This characteristic will undoubtedly promote the
wide application of pitch-based carbon fibers in composites.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
A commercial
naphthalene-derived
synthetic mesophase pitch (AR-MP, black pellet) was purchased from
Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Corp. This type of mesophase pitch has a 100%
optically anisotropic content and highly oriented liquid crystalline
texture. Its softening point is 265 °C, measured on a hot stage
with flowing nitrogen under a Carl Zeiss AX10 polarized light microscope
(PLM). The raw pitch was heated in a stainless autoclave to about
320 °C and then vigorously stirred for 4 h with an agitating
speed of ∼800 rpm to obtain the melt-stirred mesophase pitch
with a chaotic liquid crystalline texture. The softening point of
the melt-stirred pitch increased slightly to 273 °C. The as-received
(unstirred) and melt-stirred mesophase pitches were both used as raw
materials for the spinning of large-diameter pitch fibers.

4.2 Preparation and Heat Treatment of Large-Diameter
Pitch Fibers
A uniformly molten mesophase pitch preheated
in a stainless vessel was extruded under a nitrogen pressure of ∼0.2
MPa through a cylindrical die with a diameter of about 300 μm
at a spinning temperature of 320–330 °C to form large-diameter
pitch fibers (Φ, ∼30 μm), which were drawn and
collected by winding onto a rotating drum at a rotational speed of
∼20 m/min.

The as-spun pitch fibers, stacked into a thin
layer on a graphite plate, were stabilized at ∼240 °C
for ∼30 h in a flowing oxygen atmosphere with a flow rate of
300 mL/min. After complete stabilization treatment, the stabilized
pitch fibers were subsequently carbonized at 1000 °C (and 1600
°C) for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere in a tube furnace using
a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The 1000 °C-carbonized fibers
were finally graphitized at 2000, 2400, and 3000 °C at a heating
rate of 12–15 °C/min for 30 min in a medium-frequency
induction furnace under a flow of argon to obtain various graphite
fibers.18

4.3 Characterization
of the Pitch and Carbon Fibers
Mesophase pitch feedstock
and its derivative carbon fibers (including
coke) were embedded in a block of polyester resin and then carefully
polished with fine sand paper. The surfaces of the pitches, coke,
and cross sections of the fibers were then observed under a PLM in
reflectance mode. The morphology and microstructure of the carbon
and graphite fibers having undergone various high-temperature heat
treatments were imaged with a TESCAN VEGA 3 scanning electron microscope
(SEM).

The microcrystalline parameters of various fiber samples
in their powder form were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Raman
spectra of the carbon and graphite fibers in their powder form were
collected using a Renishaw InVia 2000 Raman microscope using 514.5
nm Ar+ radiation for excitation at a power of 25 mW.

The tensile properties of the carbonized and graphitized fibers,
treated at various temperatures from 1000 to 3000 °C, were measured
by single-filament testing according to ASTM standard D3822-07 at
a gauge length of 20 mm. About 30–40 fibers of each sample
were tested; the average value of the measured data with an error
of less than 10% was adopted, and the standard deviation of tensile
strength was recorded. The broken fiber ends were saved for transverse
area measurements and fracture surface analyses using SEM.

The
axial electrical resistivities of the carbon fibers, heat-treated
at various temperatures, were obtained by measurement averaging of
15–20 individual carbon fibers with a BS407 precision milli/micro-ohmmeter
using a standard four-probe method at room temperature. The axial
room-temperature thermal conductivities of the various carbon fibers
were calculated according to the accepted formula reported by Lavin.30
