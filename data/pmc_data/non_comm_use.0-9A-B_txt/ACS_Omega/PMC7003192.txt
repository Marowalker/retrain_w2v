Multiple stimuli-responsive amphiphilic
block copolymers of poly(methacrylic
acid) (PMAA) and poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA)
were used as emulsifiers to prepare two-way CO2 stimuli-responsive
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) latex particles via aqueous emulsion
polymerization. The polymerization at pH 2 and 50 °C produced
mainly PDMAEMA-surfaced PMMA latex particles, whereas the polymerization
at pH 12 and 50 °C produced mainly PMAA-surfaced particles. Both
types of latex particles appeared to precipitate at higher pH values
from the emulsifier of a longer PDMAEMA block length. The direction
from precipitation to dispersion for PDMAEMA-surfaced particles or
from dispersion to precipitation for PMAA-surfaced particles in response
to CO2 bubbling of the pH 12 dispersion of particles depended
on the PDMAEMA block length. Together, this study reveals that—by
tuning the PDMAEMA block length in PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
used as an emulsifier and polymerization at pH 2 or 12—PMMA
latex particles can exhibit two-way CO2 responsiveness
between dispersion and precipitation. Thus, due to their simple preparation
and unique dual pH and CO2 responsiveness, these newly
developed PMAA-b-PDMAEMA emulsifiers provide a highly
efficient approach for the development of smart PMMA latex nanoparticles
with desirable multifunctional properties.

Introduction
Multiple stimuli-responsive
polymer materials have received significant
attention in numerous applications.1−4 Temperature and pH are the most well-characterized
stimuli for polymeric materials in aqueous media,5,6 and
gas stimuli have recently received increased attention.7−10 CO2 has been reported as an environmentally friendly
stimulus due to its nonflammability, nontoxicity, and ease of removal.11−13 CO2 can function as a stimulus to transform neutral and
hydrophobic tertiary amine groups or amidine groups in water into
charged and hydrophilic ammonium bicarbonate or amidinium bicarbonate,
respectively.14−18 Such transformations can be subsequently reversed by removing the
CO2 by simply purging with an inert gas such as nitrogen,
argon, or air.14 Poly(dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) is one example of a tertiary amine-containing
polymer.16 In addition to CO2 stimuli-responsive tertiary amine and amidine functional groups
that transform from neutral to cationic in aqueous solution, the COOH
group of carboxylic acid can function as a CO2 stimuli-responsive
functional group that transforms from anionic to neutral.19 At high solution pH values, CO2 transforms
the dissociated carboxylates (anionic organic bases) of carboxylic
acids from a more hydrophilic form (COO–) to the
less hydrophilic COOH form. The direction of transformation for the
neutral forms of bases (e.g., amines and amidines) is the opposite
of the negatively charged forms of bases (e.g., carboxylates). Poly(methacrylic
acid) (PMAA) functions as an anionic organic base in aqueous solution
at high pH values. At high solution pH values, the relatively hydrophobic
COOH groups of PMAA dissociate into hydrophilic carboxylate anions
(COO–). The carboxylate anions can reversibly associate
with protons to form relatively hydrophobic COOH groups on bubbling
CO2. As a result, at high solution pH values, water-soluble
PMAA can be converted into a water-insoluble polymer by bubbling CO2 to lower the pH. The direction of the CO2-induced
transformation between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity for PMAA
is opposite of that for PDMAEMA; PMAA transforms from water-soluble
to -insoluble, whereas PDMAEMA transforms from water-insoluble to
-soluble on CO2 bubbling. Thus, the PMAA and PDMAEMA segments
present in the polymer structure play a critical role in self-assembly
capability and result in diverse nanostructures with unique chemical
and physical properties in aqueous solution.20

Diblock copolymers of PMAA and PDMAEMA can exhibit two-way
CO2 stimuli responsiveness, and the amphiphilicity of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA diblock copolymers can be tuned by bubbling CO2. We recently demonstrated that the amphiphilicity of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA diblock copolymers of fixed PMAA block lengths
and four different PDMAEMA block lengths can be switched on/off in
a two-way manner by CO2 bubbling, which enabled the block
copolymers to function as emulsifiers for oil-in-water emulsification.21 The opposite CO2-induced switches
in the hydrophilicity of PMAA and PDMAEMA enabled the preparation
of versatile, multifunctional block copolymer emulsifiers. Previous
studies demonstrated that poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PDMAEMA-b-PNIPAAM)
exhibits temperature- and pH-triggered amphiphilicity under specific
temperature and solution pH conditions.22,23 In aqueous
solution, this block copolymer can self-assemble into micelles to
emulsify oil in water by bubbling CO2, and the emulsification
can be reversed by subsequent N2 bubbling.24,25 This block copolymer in aqueous solution was further demonstrated
as an emulsifier for emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate
(MMA) to prepare PDMAEMA-coated poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) latex
particles that exhibit one-way CO2-responsive dispersion.26 The resulting latexes contain tertiary amines
on their surface and can be easily destabilized by removing the CO2 by bubbling an inert gas and/or increasing the temperature
to switch the hydrophilic ammonium bicarbonate surface to a hydrophobic
neutral amine surface, without the need for traditional approaches
such as adding salts, strong acids, or strong alkalies. The aggregation
and redispersion of the resulting latex particles can be reversibly
controlled by alternating between N2 and CO2 bubbling.27−30 Therefore, the potential applications of CO2/N2 as a stimulus to create an ecofriendly programmable “green
emulsion” with multifunctional amphiphilic characteristics
are highly desirable.

In this study, we demonstrate the preparation
of two-way CO2 stimuli-responsive dispersion of PMMA latex
particles via
emulsion polymerization using two-way CO2 stimuli-responsive
PMAA-b-PDMAEMA diblock copolymers as emulsifiers
at pH 2 and 50 °C or pH 12 and 50 °C (Scheme 1). Emulsion polymerization at pH 2 and 50
°C gave rise to PMMA latex particles with strongly hydrophilic
PDMAEMA chains on their surface, whereas polymerization at pH 12 and
50 °C gave rise to PMMA latex particles with strongly hydrophilic
PMAA chains on their surface. The opposite directions of the CO2-induced on/off switch in the hydrophilicity of PMAA and PDMAEMA
enabled the preparation of a two-way CO2 stimuli-responsive
dispersion of PMMA latex particles. Overall, this work provides an
example of a dual-responsive diblock copolymer with reversibly controllable
gas- and pH-switchable amphiphilic characteristics that can be used
to manipulate the reversibility of emulsification/demulsification
in response to pH changes and CO2/N2 bubbling.
Therefore, these newly developed PMAA-b-PDMAEMA diblock
copolymers hold significant potential for the development of smart
emulsion nanoparticles with controllable structures, sensitive pH
and CO2/N2 responsiveness, and reversible switching
of emulsions between the aqueous and organic phases.

and Emulsion Polymerization of MMA Using PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
as an Emulsifier at pH 2 or pH 12
Results
and Discussion
Emulsion Polymerization of MMA Using PMAA-b-PDMAEMA as an Emulsifier at pH 2 or pH 12 in N2
1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was performed
on all
samples at 25 °C to explore the structural characteristics of
the PMMA latex particles. 1H NMR spectra were generated
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 (Figure S1) to determine the compositions of the
constituent PMMA and block copolymer within PMMA latex particles prepared
by emulsion polymerization. By integrating the appropriate peak area
ratios in Figure S1, the weight fractions
of the block copolymer and PMMA in the latex particles were determined
to be about 5 and 95 wt %, respectively, for all four types of latex
particles. These compositions are almost consistent with our reaction
design and stoichiometry (Table S1). Furthermore,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra barely indicated the characteristic
FTIR peaks of PDMAEMA at 2820 and 2770 cm–1 for
CH3 stretching in N–CH3 and the characteristic
broad peak of PMAA at 3400–2400 cm–1. The
finding that both of these peaks barely appeared in the FTIR spectra
of PMMA latex particles (Figures S2 and S3) indicated that a very small quantity of the block copolymer emulsifier
was present on the surface of the PMMA latex particles. The NMR and
FTIR analyses indicated that PMMA latex particles were successfully
synthesized using a small amount of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
surfactant. In addition, all types of PMMA latex particles exhibited
high molecular weights, as shown in the gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) data in Figure S4 and Table S2. The
thermal properties of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA latex particles
were further explored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at
temperatures ranging from −20 to 170 °C. Figure S5 shows the DSC curves of pure PMMA and PMMA latex
particles prepared by emulsion polymerization at pH 2 and pH 12. Clear
glass transition temperatures (Tg) were
observed for all samples and are tabulated in Table S3. The Tg of pure PMMA
was 106 °C compared to around 118–129 °C (Table S3) for the PMMA latex particles. The single Tg increased for each particle sample (Figure S5), suggesting PMAA-b-PDMAEMA and PMMA are compatible within PMMA latex particles; this
observation can probably be attributed to increased interaction between
the PMMA and PMAA-b-PDMAEMA segments.30

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Images
of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA Nanoparticles
To
investigate the particle
size distribution and morphology of the resulting latex particles,
the PMMA latex particle dispersions prepared by emulsion polymerization
of MMA in water at pH 2 and 50 °C using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers were dripped
on a glass plate and dried in an unheated vacuum oven and the particles
were assessed by SEM. For SEM measurements, the dispersion prepared
at pH 2 was also adjusted to pH 12 or until precipitation occurred.
As indicated by the SEM images in Figure 1, the dried particles from the as-synthesized
dispersion (pH 2) were spherical, clearly separated from each other,
and about 100–150 nm in diameter for all four copolymers as
emulsifiers. Thus, all four copolymers at pH 2 could all self-assemble
into micelles and serve as stable emulsifiers, with the hydrophilic
PDMAEMA block likely outside the micelles and the relatively hydrophobic
PMAA block likely inside the micelles. A longer PDMAEMA block length
seemed to lead to larger particles (at pH 2). The particles from the
pH 12 dispersions and pH 2 dispersions appeared similar for all emulsifiers,
except for the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 emulsifier as the
dried particles from the pH 12 dispersion appeared to stick to each
other due to strong ionic interactions between sodium carboxylate
arising from the addition of NaOH. This suggests that PMAA was present
on the surface of the particles as the short PDMAEMA block length
in the outer layer of the formed micelles barely prevented PMAA from
exposure to the surface of the as-synthesized particles.

Figure 1 SEM images
of (a) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA, (b)
PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA, (c) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA, and (d) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA
prepared by emulsion polymerization of MMA at pH 2 and 50 °C
using four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as an
emulsifiers. The resulting PMMA nanoparticle dispersions had pH values
of 2 and were adjusted to pH 12 or until precipitation occurred (shown
below the image).

The pH at which the dispersions
precipitated increased with the
PDMAEMA block length, indicating that hydrophilic PDMAEMA was mostly
located in the outer layer of the formed micelles (and thus the as-synthesized
particles) since the water solubility of PDMAEMA decreases as the
solution pH increases. For the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7
and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24 emulsifiers with low PDMAEMA
block lengths, precipitation occurred at pH 5 and 6, respectively.
This suggests that the PMAA chains were present on the surface of
these particles; the particles could not precipitate at such low pH
values if only PDMAEMA chains were present on the surface.

The
PMMA latex particle dispersions prepared by emulsion polymerization
of MMA at pH 12 and 50 °C using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers were dripped onto a glass
plate and dried in an unheated vacuum oven, and the particle morphology
was investigated by SEM. The as-prepared pH 12 dispersions were also
adjusted to pH 2 or until precipitation occurred. As shown in Figure 2, the morphologies
and sizes of the dried particles from the as-synthesized dispersion
(pH 12) were significantly affected by the PDMAEMA block length. For
block copolymers in the pH 12 aqueous solution, the PMAA block dissociated
to form carboxylate anions and became hydrophilic, while PDMAEMA was
deprotonated to become hydrophobic. The block copolymer at pH 12 exhibited
amphiphilicity and could be expected to self-assemble into micelles
that could be used as an emulsifier for emulsion polymerization of
MMA. The resulting micelles would consist of the hydrophilic PMAA
block in the outer layer and hydrophobic PDMAEMA in the inner layer.
The stability of the micelles would depend on the constituent block
lengths.

PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA, (c) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA, and (d) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA
prepared by emulsion polymerization of MMA at pH 12 and 50 °C
using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as
emulsifiers. The resulting PMMA nanoparticle dispersions had pH values
of 12 and were adjusted to pH 2 or until precipitation occurred (shown
below each image).

As shown in Figure 2, the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 emulsifier did not result
in clearly separated spherical particles, whereas the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24 emulsifier appeared to give clearly separated
spherical particles with diameters of about 200 nm. This suggests
that PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 did not form stable micelles,
whereas PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24 did form stable micelles.
Particle size decreased as the PDMAEMA block length increased, indicating
that longer PDMAEMA block lengths could lead to a higher degree of
entanglement and greater contraction of the micelles in size.

The dried particles from the pH 2 and pH 12 dispersions appeared
similar, which can be attributed to the fixed PMAA block length of
the four copolymers prepared in this study. In addition, the pH at
which the dispersions precipitated increased with the PDMAEMA block
length. This finding suggests that—in addition to the PMAA
chains—parts of the PDMAEMA chains were present on the surface
of the particles and the portion of PDMAEMA exposed increased with
the PDMAEMA block length.31 The precipitation
pH would be the same for all four latex samples when only the PMAA
chains were present on the surface of the particles.

pH Responsiveness
of PMMA Latex Particle Dispersions
The PMMA latex particle
dispersions prepared by emulsion polymerization
of MMA at pH 2 and 50 °C using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers were pH-responsive (Figure 3). Under these conditions
(pH 2 and 50 °C), PMAA-b-PDMAEMA micelles would
have hydrophilic PDMAEMA in the outer layer, whereas relatively hydrophobic
PMAA is retained within the inner layer of micelles. Therefore, the
prepared PMMA latex particles would have hydrophilic PDMAEMA on the
surface of the particles and relatively hydrophobic PMAA embedded
within the hydrophobic PMMA. These PMMA latex particles could disperse
in aqueous solutions at low pH values and aggregated at high pH values
as PDMAEMA is water-soluble at low pH values and water-insoluble at
high pH values. However, as shown in Figure 3, the latex particles appeared to be homogeneously
dispersed at both low and high pH values. This indicates the PMAA
chains were not entirely embedded in PMMA; regions of the PMAA chains
must be exposed on the surface of the PMMA latex particles to allow
the particles to disperse well in water at both low and high pH values.
The precipitation pH values ranged from pH 5 to 10 depending on the
PDMAEMA block length; a longer PDMAEMA block length seemed to restrict
exposure of the PMAA chains to a greater extent, leading to precipitation
at higher pH values (Figure 3).

PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA, and (d) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA prepared by emulsion polymerization of MMA using
the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers
at pH 2. The resulting PMMA nanoparticle dispersions had pH values
of 2 and were adjusted to the desired pH. Photos were taken 8 h after
each pH change.

PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
micelles at solution pH 12 and
50 °C would possess hydrophilic PMAA blocks in their outer layer
and the hydrophobic PDMAEMA blocks would stay in the inner layer.
Therefore, PMMA latex particles prepared under these conditions would
have hydrophilic PMAA chains on their surface and hydrophobic PDMAEMA
chains embedded in the hydrophobic PMMA particles. These PMMA latex
particles would aggregate in aqueous solutions at low pH but would
stably disperse in aqueous solutions at high pH. However, as shown
in Figure 4, the particles
appeared to be homogeneously dispersed at both low and high pH values,
indicating that the hydrophobic PDMAEMA chains were not entirely embedded
in PMMA. Part of the PDMAEMA chains must be exposed on the surface
to allow the PMMA latex particles to disperse well in water at low
and high pH values. The precipitation pH values appeared to depend
on the PDMAEMA block length. A higher PDMAEMA block length seemed
to lead to greater exposure of the PDMAEMA chains and precipitation
at a higher pH (Figure 4). The PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 block copolymer with the
lowest PDMAEMA block length led to the aggregation of the latex particles
at pH values as low as pH 2 due to the low density of PDMAEMA chains
on the surface of these particles.

the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers
at pH 12. The resulting PMMA nanoparticle dispersions had pH values
of 12 and were adjusted to the desired pH. Photos were taken 8 h after
each pH change.

CO2 Responsiveness
of PMMA Latex Particle Dispersions
The PMMA latex particle
dispersions prepared by emulsion polymerization
of MMA at pH 2 and 50 °C using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers were also CO2-responsive
(Figure 5). The PDMAEMA
in PMAA-b-PDMAEMA micelles at pH 2 and 50 °C
was hydrophilic and located in the outer layer, while relatively hydrophobic
PMAA was in the inner layer. PMMA latex particles prepared under these
conditions have hydrophilic PDMAEMA on the surface of the particles,
while the relatively hydrophobic PMAA is embedded in hydrophobic PMMA.
As shown in Figure 5, the four types of PMMA latex particles were all well dispersed
in water at pH 2 as expected and also, unexpectedly, at pH 12. This
can be explained by partial exposure of PMAA on the PDMAEMA-rich surface
of particles; thus, the as-synthesized PMMA latex particles disperse
well in water at pH 12 due to their previously discussed pH responsiveness
(Figure 3).

Figure 5 Photos of dispersions
of 1 wt % (a) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA,
(b) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA, (c) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA, and (d) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA
prepared by emulsion polymerization of MMA using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers at pH 2. The resulting
PMMA nanoparticle dispersions had pH values of 2 and were adjusted
to pH 12. The pH 12 dispersions were bubbled with CO2 for
5 min, followed by bubbling N2 at 40 °C for 30 min.
Photos were taken 4 h after each pH adjustment and CO2/N2 bubbling. The pH values shown below the photos were obtained
immediately after each CO2 or N2 bubbling.

Upon bubbling CO2 for 5 min into the
pH 12 dispersions,
the pH reduced to about pH 5.4. The PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA
dispersion clearly aggregated, whereas the other three dispersions
remained homogeneous. Upon subsequent N2 bubbling at 40
°C for 30 min, the pH went back up to pH 8.1–8.5. The
PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA dispersion remained homogeneous,
whereas the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA aggregation redispersed
and both the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA dispersions clearly aggregated. As indicated
in Figure 3, the precipitation
pH values were 5, 5–6, 8, and 8–10 for the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA, PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA,
PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA, and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA dispersions, respectively. The precipitation pH
values are determined by the amount of PDMAEMA and PMAA on the surface
of the latex particles, as previously discussed in Figure 3. Since alternate CO2 and N2 bubbling into the pH 12 dispersions changed the
pH values to 5.4 and 8.5, respectively, the accompanying response
between dispersion and aggregation only occurred for dispersions with
sufficient amounts of the copolymers on the surface of the latex particles.
For instance, the pH 12 PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA dispersion
did not exhibit CO2- and N2-responsive aggregation
and dispersion as CO2 and N2 bubbling changed
the pH values to 5.5 and 8.1, respectively (Figure 3). The latex particles could disperse in
water at both of these pH values, as the exposed PMAA shielded the
short PDMAEMA7 block length in the outer layer of the particles (which
precipitate at pH 5; Figure 3). Since it was difficult to bring down the pH to 5 by CO2 bubbling, the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 block copolymer
with a very short PDMAEMA block length could not be used as an emulsifier
to prepare CO2-responsive PMMA latex particles. Therefore,
the block lengths have to be controlled properly to obtain CO2-switchable dispersions of PMMA latex particles when using
PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers.

The PMMA latex particle dispersions prepared by emulsion polymerization
of MMA at pH 12 and 50 °C using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers were also CO2-responsive
(Figure 6). PMAA in
PMAA-b-PDMAEMA micelles at pH 12 and 50 °C was
hydrophilic and located in the outer layer, while the relatively hydrophobic
PDMAEMA stayed in the inner layer. PMMA latex particles prepared under
these conditions have hydrophilic PMAA on their surface, while relatively
hydrophobic PDMAEMA is embedded in hydrophobic PMMA. As shown in Figure 6, the four types
of PMMA latex particles all dispersed well in water at pH 12 and also,
unexpectedly, at pH 2. This can be explained by partial exposure of
PDMAEMA on the PMAA-rich surface of the particles so that as-synthesized
PMMA latex particles could disperse in water at pH 2 (see the previous
discussion on pH responsiveness; Figure 4).

Figure 6 Photos of dispersions of 1 wt % (a) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA,
(b) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA, (c) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA, and (d) PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA
prepared by emulsion polymerization of MMA using the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers as emulsifiers at pH 12. The
resulting PMMA nanoparticle dispersions had pH values of 12 and were
adjusted to pH 2. The pH 12 dispersions were bubbled with CO2 for 5 min, followed by bubbling N2 at 40 °C for
30 min. Photos were taken 4 h after each pH adjustment and CO2/N2 bubbling. The pH values shown below the photos
were obtained immediately after each CO2 or N2 bubbling.

Upon bubbling CO2 for
5 min into the pH 12 dispersions,
the pH went down to about 5.4–5.5. The PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA dispersions
clearly aggregated, whereas the other two dispersions remained homogeneous.
Upon subsequent N2 bubbling at 40 °C for 30 min, the
pH increased to 8.1–8.4. The PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA
and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA aggregations redispersed
in water, whereas the two other dispersions aggregated. As shown in Figure 4, the precipitation
pH values were 2–6, 4–5, 6–8, and 6–10
for the PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA, PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA, PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA, and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA dispersions, respectively. The precipitation
pH values are determined by the amount of PDMAEMA and PMAA on the
surface of the latex particles (as discussed previously for Figure 4). Since alternate
CO2 and N2 bubbling into the pH 12 dispersions
changes the pH values to about 5.4 and 8.4, respectively, the accompanying
responsiveness between dispersion and aggregation only occurred for
dispersions with a sufficient amount of copolymer on the surface of
the latex particles. PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7/PMMA and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24/PMMA appeared to aggregate on bubbling CO2 and redisperse on bubbling N2, as CO2 and N2 bubbling changed the pH to 5.5 and 8.1 (Figure 6), allowing the latex
particles to, respectively, aggregate and disperse in water (Figure 4). This can be explained
by an insufficient amount of PDMAEMA chains on the surface of particles
due to the short PDMAEMA block length in the copolymer emulsifier.
The PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72/PMMA and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266/PMMA dispersions remained homogeneous on bubbling CO2 and aggregated on subsequent N2 bubbling, as CO2 and N2 bubbling changed the pH to 5.4 and 8.4
(Figure 6), allowing
the latex particles to respectively disperse and aggregate in water
(Figure 4). Therefore,
CO2-switchable dispersion of PMMA latex particles prepared
using the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymer as emulsifiers
at pH 12 and 50 °C could also be controlled by the block length.
Collectively, these observations demonstrate that these newly developed
PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA nanoparticles undergo reversible
CO2/N2-switchable aggregation/redispersion under
various pH conditions. Furthermore, the macroscopic amphiphilic characteristics
of the copolymers can be easily controlled by tuning the ratio of
PMAA and PDMAEMA block lengths.

Conclusions
PMAA-b-PDMAEMA copolymers of four different PDMAEMA
block lengths (in which the PMAA block length was fixed at an average
of 50 repeat units and the PDMAEMA block length varied from 7 to 266
repeat units) were synthesized by controlled/living reversible addition
fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The copolymers
were used as emulsifiers at only 0.5 wt % and successfully fabricated
nanosized PMMA latex particles via emulsion polymerization. The polymerization
at pH 2 and 50 °C gave rise to mainly PDMAEMA-surfaced PMMA latex
particles, whereas polymerization at pH 12 and 50 °C gave rise
mainly PMAA-surfaced particles. Both types of latex particles precipitated
at specific pH values depending on the PDMAEMA block length, with
longer PDMAEMA block length leading to precipitation at higher pH
values. Upon bubbling CO2 into the pH 12 dispersion of
particles, the pH reduced to about 5.4; upon subsequent N2 bubbling, the pH returned to about 8.5. The direction from precipitation
to dispersion for PDMAEMA-surfaced particles or from dispersion to
precipitation for PMAA-surfaced particles in response to CO2 bubbling depended on the PDMAEMA block length. Thus, PMAA-b-PDMAEMA copolymers could act as effective dual pH/CO2-responsive emulsifiers for the development of PMMA latex
nanoparticles that exhibit two-way CO2-responsiveness between
dispersion and precipitation.

and hydrolysis of the PtBuMA block to obtain four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers (PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7, PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24, PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72, and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266) were conducted as previously described.21

Emulsion Polymerization of MMA Using PMAA-b-PDMAEMA as an Emulsifier at pH 2 under N2
Emulsion
polymerization of MMA was conducted in a four-necked 500 mL flask
equipped with mechanical stirring and a condenser. PMAA-b-PDMAEMA (0.25 g) was added to 50 mL of deionized water in the flask,
and the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 2 using HCl and heated
to 50 °C under N2 bubbling to dissolve the PDMAEMA
block. AIBN (0.2 g, 1.25 × 10–3 mol) dissolved
in MMA (5 g, 0.05 mol) was injected through the septum into the flask
reactor to initiate emulsion polymerization of MMA at 50 °C with
stirring at 200 rpm for 3 h under N2 bubbling. At pH 2
and 50 °C under N2, the PDMAEMA block is protonated
to become hydrophilic and water-soluble, while the PMAA block has
a low degree of acid dissociation, undergoes strong hydrogen bonding
between COOH pairs, and has low water solubility. Thus, PMAA-b-PDMAEMA can be used as an emulsifier at pH 2 to form
micelles in water, with the PMAA block toward the core and the PDMAEMA
block in the shell. Emulsion polymerization of MMA initiated by AIBN
in the presence of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA at pH 2 and 50
°C under N2 is illustrated in Scheme 1. The synthesized PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA latex or dispersion was centrifuged, the top portion
of the clear solution was decanted, and the settled nanoparticles
were added to 10 mL of deionized (DI) water and centrifuged again.
The same procedure was repeated for a third time to obtain the white
nanoparticle dispersion.

Emulsion Polymerization of MMA Using PMAA-b-PDMAEMA as an Emulsifier at pH 12 under N2
This
emulsion polymerization was prepared as described above, and the environmental
pH was altered from 2 to 12. At pH 12 under N2 at 50 °C,
the PDMAEMA block is hydrophobic and water-insoluble, while the PMAA
block has a high degree of acid dissociation to form hydrophilic COO– anions and is water-soluble. The PMAA-b-PDMAEMA can be thus used as an emulsifier at pH 12 to form micelles
in water, with the PDMAEMA block toward the core and the PMAA block
in the shell.

Characterizations
Proton nuclear
magnetic resonance
(1H NMR; JNM-ECZ600R spectrometer; JOEL, Japan) at 600
MHz was used to quantitatively characterize the compositions of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA nanoparticles in DMSO-d6 solvent. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, Spectrum Two;
PerkinElmer) spectrometry was used to qualitatively characterize the
PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA nanoparticles by casting from
the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions onto KBr; spectra were measured
at room temperature at a resolution of 2 cm–1 and
sensitivity of 16 scans. The molecular weights and polydispersity
indices (PDI) of the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA nanoparticles
were determined using a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) system
equipped with a series of two columns (PLgel 10 um Mixed-B; Polymer
Laboratories) and a refractive index detector. Dimethylformamide (DMF)
containing 20 mM LiBr was the eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min
at 35 °C. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the PMMA nanoparticles were measured by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC; Q100; TA Instruments). The samples were
initially heated (20 °C/min) to 180 °C and cooled (10 °C/min)
to −50 °C and then heated at 20 °C/min to 180 °C
to record Tg. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM; S-4800; Hitachi, Japan) was used to examine the morphology of
the PMMA nanoparticles prepared by emulsion polymerization. For PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA synthesized at pH 2, the pH of the nanoparticle
dispersion was first adjusted from pristine pH 2 to pH 12 or until
precipitation occurred. For PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA synthesized
at pH 12, the pH was first from 12 to 2 or until precipitation occurred.
The particle dispersions were dripped onto a glass plate and dried
in an unheated vacuum oven before SEM.

pH Responsiveness of PMMA
Nanoparticle Dispersions
Dispersions in water of 1 wt % PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA
nanoparticles synthesized at pH 12 or 2 were adjusted to pH 12, 10,
8, 6, 5, 4, or 2 using aqueous HCl and NaOH. The phase changes (dispersion/aggregation)
induced by changing pH at 25 °C were recorded using a digital
camera. Photos were taken 8 h after each pH change.

CO2 Responsiveness of PMMA Nanoparticle Dispersions
Dispersions
in water of 1 wt % PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA
nanoparticles synthesized at pH 2 and 12 were adjusted to pH 2 or
12 to investigate phase changes (dispersion or aggregation) in response
to CO2 bubbling. For the synthesis at pH 12, the appearance
of aggregation after bubbling CO2 for 5 min at 25 °C
was recorded using a digital camera for the pH 12 PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA nanoparticle dispersion. After CO2 bubbling,
the solutions were bubbled with N2 for 30 min at 40 °C
and redispersion was recorded. For synthesis at pH 2, the disappearance
of aggregation after bubbling CO2 for 5 min at 25 °C
was recorded using a digital camera for the pH 2 PMAA-b-PDMAEMA/PMMA nanoparticle dispersion. After CO2 bubbling,
the solutions were bubbled with N2 for 30 min at 40 °C
and aggregation recovery was recorded. Photos were taken 4 h after
each gas bubbling; bubbling flow rates were controlled at 20 mL/min.
