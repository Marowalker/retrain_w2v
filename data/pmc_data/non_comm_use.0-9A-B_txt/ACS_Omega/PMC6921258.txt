Chitin, and its derivative chitosan, is a naturally occurring
biopolymer
and an abundant polysaccharide containing acetylated units of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Chitosan membranes produced
from shrimp shell (α) and squid pen (β) biowaste were
prepared by solvent-casting, after which water flux and ionic transport
diffusion experiments were conducted using a side-by-side concentration
test cell under differing salinity concentration gradients. Physicochemical
and experimental investigations were conducted, which confirmed that
β-chitin possesses differing and enhanced performance characteristics
than α-chitin with respect to diffusive water flux and ionic
transport capabilities. In addition, novel colligative investigations
through osmotic equilibrium were conducted to determine electrochemical
characteristics for the evaluation of salinity gradient power generation
suitability. Electrochemical test results under a salinity gradient
revealed extremely low energy density values, thereby limiting consideration
for commercial utility-scale salinity gradient power renewable energy
operations. However, the tested membranes possessed high water and
ion flux permeability characteristics that could find use in industrial
separation process operations such as those used in the extraction
of economically valuable materials from seawater or highly saline
industrial fluids, or reduction in the saline content of mining fluids
during dewatering and hazardous waste treatment and disposal operations,
thereby potentially fostering new market developments, which will
drive continued improvements in the responsible biowaste management
of this valuable marine bioresource.

1 Introduction
1.1 General Background
Most of the carbohydrates
found in nature occur as polysaccharides, polymers of high molecular
weight. Chitin is a naturally occurring biopolymer with great potential
for industrial use because of its high amine content and polycatonic
nature.1 Chitin is a linear homopolymer
(a polymeric carbohydrate molecule with repeating units of a single
monomeric unit), containing residues of the monosaccharide N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) joined by β
(1 → 4) linkage. Chitin occurs mainly as the principal element
in the hard exoskeletons, inner shell or cell wall of invertebrates,
fungi, and yeasts2,3 and is the second most abundant
naturally occurring polymer on earth after cellulose.

Few biological
polymers possess as high a number of amino groups as chitin, which
lead to increased strength of the chitin–polymer matrix, increased
hydrogen bonding between adjacent polymer layers, and high adsorption
properties leading to effective ion-exchange capabilities.4,5 Serving as a natural structural biopolymer,6 chitin and its derivative chitosan possess many interesting properties
including unique crystalline structures, multidimensional properties,
and nontoxicity and biodegradability in both the solution and solid-state
phases.7 Like cellulose, chitin is indigestible
by vertebrate animals and forms extended fibers.

With the recognition
of chitosan’s uniqueness comes a long
history of investigating potential uses in varying forms. For example,
in 1936, GW Rigby was granted U.S. patent number 2,040,880 for making
chitosan membrane films along with a second patent for making fibers
from chitosan.8 Other industrial operational
uses include separation membrane technologies (aqueous and gas); flocculation
of proteinaceous solids and chelation of metal ions in wastewater
treatment, microalgal biomass dewatering, beer/beverage clarification;
treatment of wounds and burns by incorporation into healing–accelerating
sutures and antibacterial surgical dressings; and as a feed and food
processing additive.1,9−15

Chitin is not soluble in ordinary solvents. As shown in Figure 1, chitin differs
from cellulose within the glucose unit where one hydroxyl group (−OH)
is replaced at the C-2 position with one acetylated amino group (NHCOCH3). Chitosan, derived from chitin by deacetylation, differs
from chitin by the converted amine group (free −NH2), which imparts a hydrophilic and polycatonic nature to the chitosan
product, enabling its solubility in dilute organic acidic solutions
where the pH is <6.6.16−18 Chitin exists in three different
crystalline structural/polymorphic forms, referred to as α-,
β-, and γ-chitin, which differ in their degree of hydration,
size of the unit cell, and number of chitin chains per cell.19 α-Chitin, the most common polymorphic
form found in commercial chitin and chitosans, is frequently obtained
from a large amount of available low-cost marine crustacean (e.g.,
lobsters, crabs, and shrimp) biowaste. β-Chitin is also available
in reduced quantities from marine cephalopod (squid pen) biowaste
but can be obtained from other marine sources such as the crystalline
fibrils of some microalgae (diatoms) and the tubes of vestimentiferans
[giant undersea tube worms].14,20,21 γ-Chitin is usually obtained from fungi and yeasts with the
crystalline structure being a combination of the α- and β-forms.

1.2 Issue Recognition
Chitin is highly
acid-resistant, and chitosan is highly alkaline-resistant; characteristics
that depend upon the end-use application can lend themselves well
for use in separation membrane applications.22 The −OH and −NH2 functional groups in chitosan
facilitate an adsorbent function, which has lent itself to numerous
investigations as an adsorbent for the treatment of wastewater and
the removal of heavy metals from liquid effluents and natural water
by biosorption.23 The sorption capacity
of chitin and chitosan materials depends on the origin of the polysaccharide,
molecular weight (Mw), degree of N-acetylation, and solution properties and varies with crystallinity,
affinity for water, and amino group content.24

α-Chitin has a very stable unit cell intrachain, intrasheet,
and intersheet hydrogen bonds forming from antiparallel crystalline
sheets, whereas the β-chitin unit cell consists of parallel
sheets with weaker hydrogen bonds between two intersheets and reduced
intrasheet attraction.25−32 These structural changes lead to higher solubility, reactivity,
and swelling ability toward solvents of β-chitin than α-chitin
after alkali treatments, which could alter the chitosan solution conformations
and impact their antibacterial activity.33

Owing to its unique crystalline structural arrangement, β-chitin
has been reported to more readily accept intercalated water molecules
than α-chitin.34 With the intracrystalline
swelling of β-chitin strongly anisotropic without modifications
to the β-chitin sheets that are maintained by strong N–H···O=C
intermolecular hydrogen bonds.35,36 Considering the reported
intercalation of water molecules within its crystalline lattice and
weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonding between sheets of parallel
chains, β-chitin may possess differing and enhanced performance
characteristics than α-chitin with respect to diffusive water
flux and ionic transport capabilities.

Chitin is the most abundant
natural polymer in the ocean and thereby
provides an enormous reservoir of organic carbon and nitrogen to draw
from.37−39 Global fisheries contribute significantly to satisfying
the world’s need for protein; however, crustacean and cephalopod
seafood processing can generate between 35 and 75% biowaste by weight
consisting of the shell, head, and viscera.40 With increasing demands in both the human population and protein
needs, continued improvement in sustainable seafood biowaste management
through new market development is essential. The twofold research
objective of this α- and β-chitin comparison effort was
toinvestigate and report on select physicochemical, colligative,
and microstructural characteristics needed to substantiate this hypothesis
of differing diffusive ion transport and osmotic flow capabilities;

advance the multifaceted synergistic goal
of biowaste
management improvement and new market development by extending the
consideration of possible chitosan biopolymer membrane uses to developing
and sustainable technologies such as salinity gradient power (SGP)
generation and industrial separation process operations.



2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Background
Chitosan’s physicochemical,
rheological, and physical properties vary significantly as a function
of its molecular weight characterization.41,42 The analytical technique frequently cited in the literature for
the determination of chitosan’s molar mass distributions, number-average
molecular weight (Mn), weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) distribution, and
polydispersity (PD = Mw/Mn), is aqueous gel permeation
chromatography (GPC)–size exclusion chromatography (SEC).16,37,43−45 Knowledge of Mn is important for thermal properties (e.g.,
glass transition, Tg) and Mw for tensile strength and impact resistance (i.e., mechanical
properties).

Chitin is insoluble in water and common organic
solvents and is usually converted to chitosan (deacetylated form of
chitin) for use, with the extractability and degree of deacetylation
(DDA, %) dependent upon the conversion process used. When the %DDA
approaches 50%, chitin becomes soluble in aqueous acidic solution
through the protonation of the NH2 group and becomes chitosan.46 The presence of both amino and hydroxyl groups
provides the chitosan macromolecule unique properties, including being
easily dissolved in aqueous acetic acid of low concentrations and
possessing a hydrophilic property, which lends to solvent stability
and water swelling.47 Chitosan biopolymer
membranes were prepared from shrimp shell (α-chitin) and squid
pen (β-chitin) chitosan powder by solvent-casting, after which
physicochemical testing and colligative water flux and ionic transport
diffusion experiments were conducted using synthetic seawater in a
side-by-side concentration test cell under differing salinity concentration
gradients. Diffusion is the spontaneous, net movement of molecules
of a substance from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration.
Since the molecules are in thermal random motion, there will be more
molecules moving from the high-concentration region to the low-concentration
region than in the opposite direction. There is no special force on
the individual molecules; diffusion is purely a consequence of statistics.

2.2 %DDA and Crystalline Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) Discussion
The functionality of linear polymers, such
as chitosan, is highly affected by the %DDA and polymer size obtained
during the conversion process.48 Typically,
chitosan is obtained by the partial deacetylation of chitin in hot
concentrated aqueous alkali (typically 40–50% NaOH for several
hours) at 100–160 °C for α-chitosan and at 80 °C
for β-chitosan.24 This hydrolysis
step removes some of the acetyl groups resulting in differing amounts
of acetylated units of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine
(GlcNAc) and deacetylated units of d-glucosamine (GlcN).
The %DDA is defined as the molar fraction of GlcN units in the copolymer
(chitosan), which is composed of GlcNAc and GlcN units.49 When the majority of GlcNAc units are converted
to GlcN units (high %DDA), the polymer becomes highly soluble in dilute
acids.

Examination of the measured FTIR spectra can provide
useful insight into the molecular characteristics, as well as reveal
any observed changes in the chemical bonds.50 FTIR spectra for the α- and β-chitosan samples tested,
illustrating both CH stretching and intrasheet or intersheet hydrogen
bond characteristics, can be found in Figure 2 (dataset can be found here). %DDA was computed from the measured spectral data using eq 1 and compared to the vendor-supplied
data, where A1655 and A3450 were the measured absorbance at 1655 cm–1 (amine group) and 3450 cm–1 (hydroxyl [OH] group),
respectively.46,51 1  Using eq 3, the computed FTIR %DDA values vs vendor-supplied values
areShrimp (α): FTIR = 89%DDA; vendor = 88%DDA.

Squid (β): FTIR = 86%DDA; vendor =
91.7%DDA.

2% chitosan membranes.

The region in Figure 2 between 2800 and 2900 cm–1 corresponds to the
vibration of CH stretching, assuming the free hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) groups dissociated from hydrogen bonds. The band at 1375
cm–1, resulting from the C–H bond in the
acetamide group, indicates that the chitin samples were not completely
deacetylated.50 The spectrum region between
3000 and 3600 cm–1 was attributed to the vibration
of either OH or NH, indicating that the hydrogen bonds appeared in
C(6)OH···O=C, C(3)OH···O, C(6)OH···OHC(3),
C(2)NH···O=C, and C(6)HO···HNC(2).33 A close review of Figure 2 reveals a similar spectral shape for both
the α- and β-chitosan samples with an overall increase
observed in the β-chitosan sample corresponding to the regions
pertaining to expected intrasheet and/or intersheet hydrogen bond
and CH stretching. The source of the band in the β-chitosan
spectra between 2300 and 2380 cm–1 is unknown.

2.3 Molecular Weight Characterization by GPC/SEC
Analytical Technique
GPC/SEC is a liquid chromatography technique
that separates macromolecules by their size in solution. Aqueous GPC–SEC
separation is based upon differential migration between the stationary
and mobile phases and governed by the hydrodynamic size and shape
of the polymer chains relative to the size and shape of the porous
pores within the column packing material. Summary data obtained from
the aqueous GPC–SEC testing effort are presented in Table 1.

2.4 Chitosan Membranes Prepared and Tested
In accordance with the procedure outlined in Section 4.4, α- and β-chitosan membrane
test samples were made with the following casting constituents:Shrimp (α): deionized (DI) = 100 mL; glacial acetic
acid = 1 mL; glycerol = 0.7 g; chitosan = 2.02 g.

Squid (β): DI = 100 mL; glacial acetic acid =
1 mL; glycerol = 0.7 g; chitosan = 2.02 g.



Resulting in a % chitosan composition of nominally 2%
(1.95%) α- and β-membranes prepared and evaluated.

2.5 Salinity Gradient Concentration Cell Test
Configurations
Instant ocean synthetic sea salt was used
throughout this testing effort to provide a suitable medium without
the deleterious effects of marine biofouling. The concentrated ionic
test solution (full brine) was made from 300 g of instant ocean sea
salt dissolved in enough DI water to make 1 L of the total solution.
The dilute ionic test solution (1:10 brine) was made by serially diluting
100 mL of the full brine solution to 1 L with DI water. Runs consisted
of either full brine or a 1:10 brine solution in the concentrated
test cell chamber side and DI water in the dilute test cell chamber
side. A summary of test configurations for each test solution type
used in this analysis along with the measured electrically “loaded”
cell potential voltage at osmotic equilibrium is presented in Table 2.

2.6 Ion Migration across the Membrane
Samples obtained from the concentration test cell were analyzed using
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrumentation.
To verify the applicability of the ICP-MS anion measurements for future
use in the calculation of total osmotic pressure, a separate Cl– ion titration was done on each of the solution test
samples for comparison. Discussion of both is presented herein.

2.6.1 ICP-MS
Seawater contains dissolved
salts at a total ionic concentration of approximately 1.12 mol/L (M)
and a computed osmotic pressure at 25 °C of 27.2 atm. A salt
is an electrically neutral ionic compound composed of two oppositely
charged ions: cations and anions. When a salt dissolves in water,
it dissociates into its individual cations and anions. Seawater is
nominally 86% sodium chloride (NaCl) with Na+ and Cl– almost completely dissociated. Every naturally occurring
element that can be found on earth has been found dissolved in seawater.
However, although present in measurable concentrations, there is a
great variation in the concentration magnitudes of the ions present.
According to chemical oceanographic convention, a concentration criterion
of one part in a million (1 ppm or 1 mg/kg) has been established as
the separation point. Elements with higher dissolved concentrations
are referred to as major constituents and those below as minor constituents.
These major ions are termed “conservative”, meaning
that they occur in constant ratios to each other in almost all ocean
(sea) water. As defined, there are 11 substances considered as major
constituents: Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Sr2+, Cl–, SO42–, HCO3–, Br–, F–, and B(OH)3. Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Cl–,
and SO42– make up >99% of the total
dissolved
constituents in seawater.

The ICP-MS is mainly used for the
elemental analysis of cations. Sulfate (SO42–) and bicarbonate (HCO3–) are polyatomic
ions (not elemental) and are very difficult to measure with ICP-MS
because the base elements of those ions, sulfur and carbon, along
with fluorine, naturally form anions. Samples were initially run on
an ICP-MS in semiquantitative mode to identify what elements were
present at concentrations that were easily measurable. The following
10 elements were mainly present: Na, Mg, Ca, K, Sr, Cl, Br, B, Li,
and Rb. Of these, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Sr, Cl, Br, and B make up 8 of the
11 major elements found in seawater. The remaining two elements (Li
and Rb) are considered minor constituents in seawater but were included
with the other eight in subsequent quantitative analyses because they
are present at high enough concentrations to be easily measured by
ICP-MS and are of frequent interest in seawater and seawater brine
element recovery studies.52,53 Measured ICP-MS sample
test results are presented in Table 3 (dataset along with measurement standard deviations
(SDs) available at https://usf.box.com/s/54t71bo9vv633xuf23ms2vo0mc4q07ay).

2.6.2 Cl– Ion Titration
Backup concentration cell water sample Cl– ion
titration testing began by serially diluting 1 mL of test sample to
100 mL with DI water and then adding it to a 250 mL beaker with magnetic
stirring. Both electrodes were immersed in the solution, and agitation
began. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was then added in 0.5 mL
increments, both the volume of the titrant were added, and the multimeter
value was recorded on a spreadsheet after each addition. Using the
data from the spreadsheet, a second-order differential potential curve
was plotted to determine the titration end point and corresponding

of the AgNO3 titrant (CAgNO3) (0.1 N for full-brine-based samples or 0.01 N for 1:10 brine-based
samples or less) and the original test sample volume (VCl–) to determine the desired Cl– molarity present (CCl–) in the test sample according to eq 2 2  Data obtained from both the Cl– ion potentiometric titration (CCl–) and the ICP-MS testing are presented in Table 4 with the results displayed

Close examination of the Figure 3 results showed that in general, above a
Cl– ion concentration of ∼1 M, the % differences
from the Cl– titration produced values slightly
higher than the
ICP-MS (runs A4-2, A7-1, B1-3, B1-10, B1-14, B1-16, B1-17, B2-1; median
= −8.26%, standard deviation = 3.98%, and variance (sA) = 0.16%) whereas, below a Cl– ion concentration of ∼1 M, the % difference from the Cl– titration produced values slightly lower than the
ICP-MS (runs A5-3, B1-6, B1-8, B2-3, B2-8, B2-11; median = 4.32%,
standard deviation = 3.23%, and variance (sB) = 0.10%). The variances from the two sample concentration regions
were compared using a two-tailed F-test and along
with a 95% confidence null hypothesis (Ho) that no significant difference in the variances exists (eqs 3 and 4) 3   4  Pursuant to this, the value for Fexp = (0.0016)2/(0.0010)2 = 2.2945,
and the critical value for F (0.05, 7, 5) is 6.853.
Because Fexp is less than F (0.05, 7, 5), we retain the null hypothesis and have no evidence
for a significant difference between sA and sB, which means that the standard
deviations of the 14 test samples can be pooled.

Visual examination
of the corresponding measurement closeness presented
in the Figure 3 data
reveals no significant observed determinate error affecting the results.
To statistically substantiate this observation, a paired two-tailed t-test method statistical analysis was used with the entire
17 (14 tests and 3 standard) % difference sample dataset (covering
a broad Cl– concentration range between 0.058 M
and 3.766 M; median (X) of −1.35% and a 7.27%
standard deviation (SD)) along with a 95% confidence null hypothesis
that the overall median is not significantly different from 0 (eqs 5 and 6) 5   6  Pursuant to this, the value for texp = (|0.0 – (−0.0135)|√17)/0.0727
= 0.765, and the critical value for t (0.05, 16)
is 2.120. Because texp is less than t (0.05, 16), we retain the null hypothesis and have no
evidence for a significant difference between X =
μ. Statistically based results from both two-tailed F-test and Student’s t test support
the use of the ICP-MS measurements for Cl– and Br– and the effectiveness of the ICP-MS methodology steps
taken to minimize any carryover measurement effects.

2.7 Osmotic Pressure, Water and Cl– Ion Transport, Multi-Ion Transport, and Osmotic Equilibrium Discussion
Discussions on water and ionic transport diffusion and how it relates
to osmotic pressure and osmotic equilibrium are presented herein.

2.7.1 Osmotic Pressure
The osmotic pressure,
π, of a solution containing n moles of solute
particles in a solution of volume V can be determined
in rough approximation under dilute (ideal) conditions using the van’t
Hoff equation, which obeys a form like the ideal-gas law 7  where V is the volume of
the solution, n is the number of moles of solute, R is the ideal-gas constant, and T is the
temperature on the Kelvin scale. Equation 7 can be rewritten as 8  where M is the molarity of
the solution, expressed as the number of moles of solute per liter
of solution, and the units of π are in atmospheres (atm). The
ICP-MS provides individual ion concentrations in units of parts per
billion, which are converted to molarity and then summed together
to determine the total solution molarity. According to the van’t
Hoff equation, an ideal solution containing 1 mol of dissolved particles
per liter of solvent (1 M) at 25 °C will have an osmotic pressure
of 22.2 atm.

2.7.2 Water and Cl– Ion Transport
Typical Cl– ion and water transport diffusion
measurements across a casted nominal 2% β-chitosan membrane
under an equalizing full brine/DI concentration gradient are presented
in Figure 4. The shape
of the Cl– ion diffusion across the membrane under
test from the concentrated test chamber side into the dilute test
chamber side was determined using a chloride-ion-selective electrode
immersed in the dilute test chamber. Data postprocessing included
normalizing each measured Cl– ion concentration
data point to the maximum value measured once equilibrium was reached
(t > 20 h). Water transport from the dilute test
chamber into the concentrated test chamber was determined through
periodic observations of rising water within a manometer emanating
from the concentration test chamber side against a vertically mounted
measurement tape with discrete data points measured and a fitted polynomial
presented for comparison.

Figure 4 Measured water transport and Cl– ion diffusion
across a 2% β-chitosan membrane.

Examination of Figure 4 reveals a similar curve shape across the
β-chitosan
membrane for the Cl– ion transport under both high
(full brine) and low (1:10 brine) test cell solution conditions and
water transport via net osmotic flow (dataset available at https://usf.box.com/s/54t71bo9vv633xuf23ms2vo0mc4q07ay). Extended and varying temporal observations of water transport
measurements made for the B1-17 full brine run are presented along
with the automated B1-17 Cl– measurement run data.
Also included in Figure 4 is a normalized 5-run average obtained from the dilute side of a
1:10 brine concentration/DI test configuration for comparison to the
B1-17 full brine run data. The smaller fluctuation observed in the
five-run average plot is a function of the five-run averaging. Select
measured values for Cl– ion migration and water
transport across both α- and β-chitosan membranes for
various conditions are presented in Table 5.

Examination of the Table 5 results revealsAn increase in the observed water level heights within
the manometer with increased initial Cl– concentration
(osmotic pressure) under the full brine/DI test condition for both
the α- and β-chitosan membranes.

A significant increase in the observed water level height
for the β-chitosan membrane as compared to that for the α-chitosan
membrane (2.4 times) over the same DI/full brine solution test condition.



2.7.3 α- and β-Chitosan Membrane Multi-Ion
Transport
Using select data from the Table 2 run summary and Table 3 measured ICP-MS solution data, cross α-
and β-chitosan membrane ion transport concentrations for Na,
Cl, K, Mg, Ca, B, Br, Li, Sr, and Rb were calculated and are presented
in Figure 5a–c
for full brine/DI and Figure 5d–f for 1:10 brine/DI. Specific runs used areFull brine/DI; for α-chitosan, the average of
runs A4-2, A7-1, and for β-chitosan, the average of runs B1-3,

Sr, and Rb transported across the α and β 2% chitosan

Close examination reveals greater transport in
the β-chitosan
membrane over the α-chitosan membrane for monovalent Na, Cl,
and K ions for both solution concentrations examined. These ions have
larger crystal radii and weaker hydration shells, which may enable
easier detachment from their hydration layer while passing across
the β-chitosan membrane with its weaker intermolecular hydrogen
bonding between the sheets of parallel chains.34 Cross-membrane ion transport also occurred for the remaining
ions examined. However, with the exception of greater transport observed
in the α-chitosan membrane over the β-chitosan membrane
for the divalent Mg ion in the full brine solution, the closeness
and SD overlap prevent an accurate prediction of any overall trend
determination. Therefore, it was not possible to determine from the
measured data if greater transport would also occur in the α-chitosan
membrane over the β-chitosan membrane for the other divalent
and trivalent ions tested. However, enough information was obtained
to confirm the initial reports in the literature, which postulated
that β-chitin may possess differing and enhanced performance
characteristics than α-chitin with respect to diffusive water
flux and ionic transport capabilities.

2.7.4 Osmotic Equilibrium
Using eq 8 and measured ICP-MS solution
data obtained from Table 3, an example calculation of the osmotic pressure and resulting
osmotic equilibrium after t > 20 h is presented
in Table 6.

a Full brine/DI maximum difference
between runs A5-1 and B1-2 = 192.5 atm. Slight variation from the
expected nominal 50% due to previously mentioned deviation from ideal
concentration conditions of the highly concentrated full brine.

2.8 Osmotic-Pressure-Driven Market Opportunities
Salinity gradient power (SGP) generation and/or separation process
operations are possible market areas discussed herein for consideration.
Although numerous SGP solutions have been discussed in the literature,
the most often cited technologies focus on variations of two existing
water desalting membrane processes: pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO)
and reverse electrodialysis (RED), where a significant driving force
in the industrial development of membranes already exists. PRO and
RED utilize the electrochemical properties of solutions of differing
saline concentrations (salinity) separated by charged semipermeable
ion-exchange membranes.54−56 In PRO, the osmotic process increases
the volumetric flow of the high-pressure solution and is the energy-transfer
mechanism with the gross energy gain per unit membrane area equal
to the product of the pressure difference multiplied by the volume
flow of freshwater through the membrane.57 Key to PRO is the cost-effective manufacture of semipermeable membranes
with high water flux permeability and high salt retention (low salt
flux). In RED, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and cation exchange
membranes (CEMs) are alternately arranged to form a repeating unit
called a cell. The basic RED stack consists of several hundred AEM/CEM
cell pairs bound together between end electrodes (anode and cathode)
with the driving electromotive force (EMF) in RED provided solely
by the salinity concentration gradient. Voltages are generated across
each membrane generated from the differences in chemical potentials
of the salt ions found in the concentrated and dilute solutions with
the back EMF of the transmembrane voltages’ additive. Key to
RED, also known as a dialytic battery, is the cost-effective manufacture
of semipermeable ion-exchange membranes with high permselectivity
(highly permeable for counterions but impermeable to co-ions).

To examine the suitability of chitosan membranes for PRO and/or RED
operations, we need to examine both the water flux and ion transport
characteristics from an osmotic process perspective. Examination of Figure 4 revealed the presence
of an osmotic transport flux, which leveled off to zero when osmotic
equilibrium was reached, and examination of Figures 5a–f revealed the occurrence of cross-membrane
ion transport. From this, enough detail is available to determine
that neither membrane possessed the necessary high salt retention
(low salt flux) or high permselectivity to either anions or cations
required for PRO/RED operations. Therefore, based on the above findings,
the use of chitosan membranes would likely not be a good fit for commercial-scale
PRO or RED SGP operations.

Although the use of the chitosan
membranes tested herein would
likely not be a good fit for either PRO or RED SGP operations, consideration
was given for possible use in an electrochemical concentration fuel
cell58 as part of a fuel cell membrane
electrode assembly. Chitosan-based membrane electrolyte has been considered
as an alternate candidate in the production of economical fuel cells.59,60 As shown in Table 3, both chitosan membranes revealed a nominally loaded membrane voltage
potential of 0.6 mV under osmotic equilibrium conditions for either
test solution concentration amount @100% relative humidity, corresponding
to a power density of ∼1.5 nW/cm2 as tested. This contrasts to almost an order of magnitude lower
than the ∼ 8.5 nW/cm2 power density previously measured
by the author using bipolar ion-exchange membranes in the same electrochemical
test cell.54−56 To put these results into perspective for comparison
purposes, according to the European Commission (EC) salinity power
estimates,61 the first commercial 10 MW
PRO SGP generation plants would need membranes capable of production
of at least 0.6 mW/cm2.

A review of the recent literature
revealed chitin films prepared
with crab-shell-derived purified chitin using a group of enzymes obtained
from Streptomyces griseus. The purified
chitin slurry was dispersed in DI water with chitin sheets prepared
by suction filtration.62 The proton conductivity
of these films was examined in a traditional H2/air fuel
cell with the findings that the chitin becomes the electrolyte of
the fuel cell in the humidified condition with a typical power density
of 1.35 mW/cm2 at a 100% relative humidity. Kawabata deduced
that the relation between the chitin hydrated structure and the proton
conduction path formed by the hydrogen bond with the water molecule
is significantly important and that these water molecules form hydrogen
bonds between the hydroxyl and amino-acetyl groups.

It is important
to mention that the electrical conduction method
of the traditional H2/air fuel cell using proton-conducting
cation permselective chitin sheets is different from that of the ∼90%
DDA nonion-selective chitosan membranes in an electrochemical fuel
cell considered herein. In addition, the partial deacetylation process
used to convert chitin to chitosan removes some of the amino-acetyl
groups, which may contribute to the low energy density observed in
the ∼90% DDA chitosan membranes evaluated herein. While it
is possible that the energy density output of the electrochemical
fuel cell will improve slightly upon using chitosan membranes with
a lower % DDA value, it is unlikely that the necessary large-scale
improvements in energy density from nW/cm2 to mW/cm2 for utility-scale generation purposes will be realized going
from ∼90% DDA to the ∼50% DDA lower limits for chitin/chitosan
conversion.

2.9 Dry Membrane Thickness and Gel Swelling Index
(GSI) Discussion
Typical measurements of dry thickness and
% gel swelling index (GSI) for new/used membranes (using eq 10 of Section 4.9) are presented as follows:Shrimp (α) new: thickness = 0.07112 mm; wet weight
= 350 g; dry weight = 150 g; computed % GSI = 1.33.

Shrimp (α) used: thickness = 0.06858 mm; wet weight
= 1,350 g; dry weight = 530 g; computed % GSI = 1.55.

Squid (β) new: thickness = 0.10160 mm; wet weight
= 720 g; dry weight = 320 g; computed % GSI = 1.25.

Squid (β) used: thickness = 0.05588 mm; wet weight
= 660 g; dry weight = 280 g; computed % GSI = 1.36.



Examination reveals that although the dry thickness
of the new β-chitosan membrane was more than that for the new
α-chitosan membrane, the %GSI value for the new β-chitosan
membrane was less than that for the new α-chitosan membrane.
Compare that to the used β-chitosan membranes, which was lower
in both dry thickness and %GSI than that of a used α-chitosan
membrane. This result is also supported by visual/textual observations
in which the used β-chitosan membrane physically felt thinner
than and was not as stiff as when new.

2.10 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Membrane
Discussion
SEM 10 000× (low-resolution) and 50 000×
(high-resolution) images from a new piece of α-chitosan membrane
are presented in Figure 6a,b, respectively. SEM images from a new piece of β-chitosan
membrane under magnifications of 10 000× and 50 000×
are presented in Figure 6c,d, respectively. Examination of the 10 000× images
reveals general surface cracking present in both images with the α-chitosan
membrane exhibiting more. Examination of the higher 50 000×
resolution images reveals more detail of the crack structure and patterns.
In neither case was a pore-like structure observed at either magnification
in either imaged membrane sample. Although not examined directly,
the increased diffusive water flux and ionic transport capabilities
noted herein for the β-chitosan as compared to those for the α-chitosan
membrane could be attributed to weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonding
found in β-chitosan between the sheets of parallel chains.34

Figure 6 (a) SEM low-resolution (10 000×) image of
a 2% α-chitosan
membrane. Scale bar: 5 μm. (b) SEM high-resolution (50 000×)
image of a 2% α-chitosan membrane. Scale bar: 1 μm. (c)
SEM low-resolution (10 000×) image of a 2% β-chitosan
membrane. Scale bar: 5 μm. (d) SEM high-resolution (50 000×)
image of a 2% β-chitosan membrane. Scale bar: 1 μm.

The 50 000× α-chitosan image with the larger cracks
displayed was very
unstable under the electron beam with the crack expansion occurring
during observation. It is conjectured that the thinner α-membrane
is breaking up under the hot electron beam as evidenced by the cracks
being wider in the image center where the beam is more concentrated.
This crack expansion was not observed on the 50 000× β-chitosan
sample when imaged. No similar expansion was noted during observation
on either of the 10 000× samples but any minor expansion
would be harder to see at 10 000× vs 50 000×;
so, it is difficult to determine if the differences in the width of
the crack between the two 10 000× images are real differences
or reflect an instability problem (heating) caused by the differences
in the membrane thickness.

3 Conclusions
Physicochemical and novel
colligative investigations of α-
and β-chitosan membranes were conducted, which confirmed literature
discussions that β-chitin may possess differing and enhanced
performance characteristics than α-chitin with respect to diffusive
water flux and ionic transport capabilities. Electrochemical test
results under a salinity gradient revealed extremely low energy density
values across either membrane, thereby limiting future consideration
in commercial utility-scale salinity gradient power energy generation
operations. However, the tested membranes possessed high water and
ion flux permeability characteristics that could foster new market
developments into separation process operations such as those used
in the extraction of economically valuable materials from seawater
or highly saline industrial fluids, the reduction in the saline content
of mining fluids during dewatering, or during hazardous waste treatment
and disposal operations.

4 Experimental Section: Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Chitosan membranes were
prepared from two commercially obtained sources: shrimp shells from
Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (CAS 9012-76-4; Sigma-Aldrich P/N C3646-25G),
and squid pens from GTC Bio Corporation, Qingdao, China (SGC-2). The
shrimp-based product was obtained as a white powder with a vendor-supplied
DDA value of 88%, and the squid-based product was obtained as a white
powder with a vendor-supplied DDA value of 91.7%. The viscosity of
a solution of 1% chitosan (by weight) in 1% (by volume) aqueous acetic
acid was provided by the vendor as 232 cP for the shrimp-based chitosan
and ≤300 cP for the squid-based chitosan.

Reagent-grade
chemicals obtained and used include glacial acetic acid (C2H4O2), glycerol (C3H8O3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), nitric acid (HNO3), potassium bromide (KBr), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and
sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2). Synthetic
seawater was prepared using instant ocean sea salt (Spectrum Brands)
dissolved in Milli-Q ultrapure (18.2 MΩ cm) water from a Millipore
purification system.

4.2 Determination of DDA and Crystalline Characteristics
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry was used to determine
the DDA and examine any observed changes in intrasheet or intersheet
hydrogen bond characteristics of the α- and β-chitosan
samples. %DDA results were then compared to the vendor-supplied values.
Chitosan powder was mixed with KBr (1:15) and pressed into a pellet.
The spectrum was collected in transmission mode over a 400–4000
cm–1 range by placing the pellet in the beam path
of an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Magna). A total of 256 scans at a
2 cm–1 resolution were averaged and corrected for
background CO2 and water in a nitrogen-purged compartment.

4.3 Molecular Weight Characterization by Aqueous
GPC/SEC Discussion
Aqueous GPC/SEC testing was conducted
on a Viscotek TDA305 and GPCmax system, running OmniSEC. 4.6.2 analysis
software and configured for GPC/SEC triple detection analysis. The
GPC/SEC system was equipped with a temperature-controlled oven housing
four columns and three detectors: refractive index (RI), right angle
and low angle light scattering (RALS/LALS), and a four-capillary differential
viscometer. In triple detection SEC/GPC, the RI detector is employed
to calculate concentration, refractive index increment (dn/dc), and injection recovery. Light scattering provides
absolute molecular weight, while the viscometer delivers intrinsic
viscosity (η), hydrodynamic radius (Rh), and conformational and structural parameters. SECs used werePolyAnalytik AquaGEL GPC column-206, exclusion limit:

The mobile phase selected for use consisted of 0.1 M
acetic acid and 0.3 M sodium nitrate mixture in HPLC-grade water.
Chitosan powder samples were dissolved in the mobile phase at a concentration
of approximately 4.0 mg/mL (4.40 for shrimp and 4.35 for squid) and
filtered through a 0.22 μm poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane
syringe filter prior to injection. Injection parameters include 100
μL injection, column temperature: 35 °C, flow rate: 0.7
mL/min, run time: 60 min. Run summary consisted of triplicate runs
with the verification standards injected at the end of the sample
injections to verify detector calibrations.

4.4 Chitosan Membrane Preparation by Casting/Solvent
Evaporation
The chitosan membrane solution was prepared by
combining DI water, chitosan, and glacial acetic acid (casting solvent)
in a 200 mL beaker and placed on a magnetic stirrer plate with moderate
stirring for 48 h at room temperature until thoroughly dissolved and
clear.63 The solution was then heated to
60 °C, and glycerol was added as a plasticizer. After mixing
for 15 min, the solution was removed from the heat for 30 min, followed
by 1 h under a 15 in. Hg vacuum to degas. After setting for 2 h outside
the vacuum chamber at ambient laboratory conditions (nominally 20–25
°C, 40–55% RH air, standard pressure), a single membrane
was cast by pouring the chitosan/glycerol solution onto a leveled
20.3 × 27.9 cm2 (8 ×11 in.) glass plate framed
with strips of 0.635 cm (1/4 in.) thick acrylic (methyl methacrylate).
Water and acetic acid evaporation occurred under ambient conditions
for at least 3 days under a ventilated fume hood, scored in half along
the short side, and peeled from the casting surface. Since the as-cast
membranes are completely soluble in water at this point, the dried
membranes were placed in a 2% NaOH solution (10.05 g of NaOH in 500
mL of DI water) for 30 min and then washed extensively with DI water
until neutral pH was obtained.64 The neutralized
and now insoluble membranes were stored in DI water until they were
placed inside the concentration cell test fixture at the commencement
of the water flux and ionic transport diffusion experiments.

4.5 Water Cl– Ion Migration
across the Membrane
The laboratory test apparatus consisted
of a single, side-by-side concentration cell of cubic design with
nominal outer dimensions of 10 cm × 10 cm × 7 cm, connected
to a Vernier LabPro sensor interface for remote data collection using
Logger Pro 3 data collection software. The test cell consists of end
plates, electrodes made from #40 wire silver (Ag) mesh, two symmetrical
test chambers (a concentrated solution side and a dilute solution
side), and a single chitosan membrane under test, all separated by
gaskets for sealing the cell and containing the liquid within. Inner
test chamber nominal dimensions were 7 cm × 7 cm × 2.5 cm.
A detailed description of the concentration test cell operation can
be found in Merz.54,56

During each run, “loaded”
cell potential voltage measurements were logged across the electrodes
and a 500 Ω (nom.) resistor was connected in parallel. Cumulative
multispecies ion transfer across the membrane was determined using
ICP-MS analysis of samples selectively removed from the test cell
at run completion. Visual evidence of the migration of water moving
across the membrane from the dilute test chamber to the concentrated
test chamber under direct osmotic flow was observed at ambient laboratory
conditions. To accomplish this, a manometer, constructed out of a
piece of 0.635 cm (1/4 in.) ID Tygon tubing, was attached to the exit
port of the concentrated solution side of the test chamber and secured
vertically above the test cell with the other end of the tube open
to ambient laboratory conditions. The exit port tube was examined
for the presence of water, and when observed, its incremental height
change was recoded as it rose vertically in the tube until it stopped
when isotonic (equal osmotic pressure) conditions were obtained in
each chamber side.

4.6 ICP-MS Discussion
Aqueous samples
obtained from the concentration cell were diluted by a factor of 10–1000
with 2% nitric acid, except where concentrations were below the lowest
calibration standard, in which case no dilution was performed. A small
amount of internal standard solution containing Be, Sc, Ge, and Y
was added to each sample to correct for instrumental drift during
analysis. Prepared samples were analyzed with an Agilent 7500cx ICP-MS
equipped with a concentric micromist nebulizer, a double-pass quartz
spray chamber, and a high matrix introduction (HMI) accessory. Samples
were introduced into the ICP-MS via Tygon tubing using an ASX-500
autosampler. An external six-point calibration curve was used to determine
elemental concentrations. A 2% nitric acid solution was used as a
blank and to rinse the instrument between samples. Samples were analyzed
for Li, Na, Mg, K, Ca, Rb, and Sr at lower dilution factors (10 or
100). Because of their potential for carryover, Cl, B, and Br were
analyzed separately at higher dilution factors (100 or 1000), along
with an extended rinse time using both a 5% nitric acid solution and
a 2% nitric acid solution. Additionally, a blank was analyzed after
every standard and sample to minimize any carryover. Anions Cl– and Br– are typically not measured
with the ICP-MS but because of their relative importance as major
seawater constituents, Cl– 55.06% and Br– 0.173% total salt in seawater,65 their
inclusion was important to this analysis. Evaluation of the published
literature revealed the use of ICP-MS for the determination of Br– 66 and analysis
of Cl– from sweat for use in the diagnosis of cystic
fibrosis.67,68 Because of the high concentrations of Cl– present in the samples, a separate Cl– ion titration was made on each test sample for ICP-MS comparison
to ensure the validity of the ICP-MS Cl– measurement
method and resulting values.

4.7 Cl– Ion Titration Discussion
Chloride ion concentrations were determined by potentiometric titration69,70 with silver nitrate (AgNO3) using a converted dual-electrode
pH meter with the agitation of the immersed electrodes achieved using
a 120S Fisher Scientific magnetic stirrer. During titration, a Fluke
8062A True RMS multimeter was used to detect the change in potential
between a Thermo Orion 9416BN silver/sulfide half-cell electrode and
a Thermo Orion 900200 double-junction reference electrode. During
the titration, the two electrodes were connected to the pH meter via
the terminals used for the glass electrode and calomel electrode normally
used in pH measurements.

When AgNO3 is slowly added
to the Cl– ion containing synthetic seawater test
sample, an insoluble precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms according
to eq 9 9  The end point of the titration occurs when
all of the chloride ions are precipitated and is determined by the
multimeter reading at which the greatest change in voltage has occurred
for a small and equal added increment of AgNO3.

4.8 Osmotic Pressure
Certain materials,
including many biological membranes, are semipermeable, meaning that
when they come in contact with a solution, they selectively allow
the passage of certain molecules or ions to cross the membrane while
blocking others. Osmosis or osmotic flow refers to the net diffusional
movement of solvent molecules across a semipermeable membrane under
the effect of a concentration gradient toward the solution with the
higher solute concentration. The only way to stop osmosis is to raise
the hydrostatic pressure on the concentrated solution side of the
membrane and achieve osmotic equilibrium. This can be done through
the application of a suitable amount of external pressure, by letting
the pressure build up via osmotic flow into an enclosed region, or
in the case of our test chamber through the pressure difference resulting
from the unequal vertical liquid height in the concentrated side exit
port tube. The pressure required to achieve osmotic equilibrium and
stop the net osmotic flow is known as the osmotic pressure.71,72

Osmotic pressure along with boiling point elevation, freezing
point depression, and vapor pressure depression are known as colligative
properties that arise solely from the dilution of a solvent by nonvolatile
solutes. The word colligative comes from the Latin colligatus meaning
to bind together. Colligative properties are physical properties of
solutions that depend almost entirely on the total concentration of
the dissolved species (ions or molecules) and not on the nature or
identity of the species present55

4.9 Dry Membrane Thickness and Gel Swelling Index
(GSI) Determination
Dry membrane thickness and gel swelling
index (GSI) measurements were obtained from new/used pieces of the
casted α- and β-chitosan membranes. Because of limited
source availability, these pieces were obtained from the same manufactured
batch but were not the same piece. The “used” pieces
were the actual membranes used in the concentration test cell, subject
to both transmembrane water and ion transport, whereas the “new”
pieces were batch remnants that were only exposed to DI water. New/used
dry membrane thickness and GSI measurements were initiated by placing
samples of each membrane into a desiccator and weighing them daily
until there was no measurable change in weight as compared to the
prior measurement, after which a final weight was recorded, as well
as a dry thickness measurement using a dial caliper. The samples were
then placed in DI water for 24 h, after which they were removed, wiped
with a dry tissue, and weighed. This procedure continued until there
was no measurable change in weight as compared to the prior measurement,
after which a final weight was recorded and the GSI computed using eq 10 10  Comparable visual evidence of surface deformation
and overall shrinkage was present after drying, especially in the
“used” pieces.

4.10 SEM Membrane Examination
A small
sample from each of the cast membranes was mounted on an aluminum
stub and coated with a thin layer of gold/palladium metal. It was
then imaged at two different magnifications (10 000× and
50 000×) using a Hitachi S-3500N variable pressure scanning
electron microscope with a resolution of 3 nm. Images were adjusted
to match the contrast and brightness of each other for comparison.
