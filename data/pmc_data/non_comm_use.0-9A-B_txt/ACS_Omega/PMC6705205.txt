Rare
earth minerals (REMs) such as bastnaesite, monazite, and xenotime
are of considerable significance since they are the main commercial
sources for rare earth elements (REEs) with cutting-edge applications.
Fundamental understanding of surface properties of REMs is essential
to identify the reactions taking place at different interfaces to
develop more robust technologies for the recovery of REEs. The goal
of this study is to provide a comprehensive investigation on the surface
energy characteristics of bastnaesite and xenotime, as the primary
sources of light and heavy rare earth elements, respectively. Crystal’s
orientation of REMs was identified using surface X-ray diffraction
analysis, whereas the morphology and elemental composition were characterized
using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectra analyses.
Wettability of REMs was studied using sessile drop contact angle measurement
technique, and the surface energy and its constituents were evaluated
using Fowkes, van Oss–Chaudhury–Good, Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble,
Zisman, and Neumann models. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used
to compare the local surface properties and work of adhesion of REMs
by analyzing the force profile between the mineral surfaces and a
n-type silicon tip. Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) was employed
to study the surface energy heterogeneity of REM powders and evaluate
the dispersive and Lewis acid–base interactions. Results indicated
that the dispersion forces have a larger contribution to the surface
energy of both REMs in comparison with the polar interactions. The
surface energy values obtained using contact angle measurements were
lower than those obtained using IGC, however, the IGC results seemed
to be closer to reality since the contact angle results showed a strong
dependence on probe liquids, roughness, and local properties of the
surfaces. Contact angle measurements and AFM analysis indicated that
bastnaesite had higher hydrophobic character, whereas the IGC analysis
revealed that the surface energy of xenotime was lower than that of
bastnaesite at higher surface coverages. Despite the shortcomings
of each method, results showed that a combination of these techniques
could provide a deeper understanding of surface energy and wetting
behavior of minerals.

1 Introduction
The research in the field
of rare earth elements (REEs) and their
compounds is ongoing to better understand their physics and chemistry,
which is essential to develop more efficient chemicals, reagents,
and processes for the separation and recovery of heavy and light rare
earth elements from host minerals. Beneficiation of rare earth minerals
(REMs) and the consequent separation of REEs and their compounds have
been very challenging at industrial scale due to their complex chemistries
and similar physiochemical properties. Thermodynamic properties of
surfaces and interfaces govern the response of rare earth minerals
to a variety of separation processes such as froth flotation, dissolution,
dispersion, flocculation, precipitation, and crystallization.1−5 For example, in froth flotation process, minerals are separated
based on the differences in their surface wettability, which influence
the adsorption selectivity of reagents at solid/liquid/gas interfaces.
This, in turn, has a significant impact on the particle–bubble
attachment and, thus, the overall mineral recovery.5−7

Surface
energy is the main property, which describes the wetting
characteristics of mineral surfaces and the forces acting on them.
It is considered as the amount of work required to make more of a
surface. It is the phenomena that controls the hydrophobicity, reactivity,
and polarity of minerals.8−10 Conceptually, unfilled bonds
at the edge of the solid and the effect of the nonadjacent molecules
in the solid are key factors determining the total surface energy.11 Two main components, namely, dispersion and
polar, are usually considered for the calculation of total surface
energy of solid materials.12,13 The dispersion interactions
result from long-range intermolecular forces caused by the interactions
between electronic dipoles and induced dipoles in neighboring molecules
or atoms.12 The polar interactions are
hydrogen-bonding, short-range interactions that are designated as
Lewis acid–base or electron-donor/electron-acceptor reactions.14 The nature of the chemical interactions taking
place at the material surface is controlled by these surface energy
constituents. Therefore, determination of the surface energy components
of rare earth minerals, for example, can provide significant information,
which will help to modify their surfaces for the purpose of designing
more robust separation technologies.

Various techniques have
been employed to assess the surface energy
of minerals and other solid materials. Contact angle measurement is
the most common technique used to analyze the wettability and surface
energy of solid surfaces.15 Contact angle
measurement using direct optical method is advantageous because of
its simplicity and the fact that only a small amount of probe liquids
and small surface substrates is required. On the other hand, the small
size of the liquid and substrate can increase the risk and impact
of impurities on the contact angle.16,17 Another serious
limitation of the optical method is the inaccuracy of measurement
as assigning a tangent line on the drop profile is uncertain when
the contact angle is small (below 20°).18 In addition, surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity could
cause barriers to the motion of the three-phase contact line, which
leads to the variation of contact angle values.19,20 This chemical heterogeneity is due to the existence of impurities
or functional groups on the surface, crystal orientation, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic
sites on the surface. These can lead to energy heterogeneity and can
largely affect the interactions between surfaces. Despite all advantages
of this technique, such as its ability to investigate the surface
energy of various crystalline faces, it is a macroscopic technique
that gives an “average” surface property and does not
present every specific site of nonideal mineral surfaces. Therefore,
it is not applicable for powders with irregular shapes and varying
surface area, porosity, and surface roughness.

Inverse gas chromatography
(IGC) is a powerful technique for a
more accurate evaluation of the anisotropic surface energy of powders
and investigating the surface energy distributions of real materials.21 This method is advantageous over conventional
optical techniques since it avoids the effect of problems caused by
surface roughness and morphology. However, IGC at infinite dilution
conditions preferentially probes the sites with the highest energy.22 The major limitation of IGC is the inability
to distinguish the surface energy of individual crystalline face.

Recently, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to investigate
the surface energy of solid materials due to its capability of probing
the surface interactions at molecular level.23 The principle of surface analysis by AFM method is based on the
measurement of the adhesion or pull-off force. Adhesion force is defined
as the force required to pull the tip off the surface and is estimated
by determining the deflection of the cantilever. The tip–sample
interactions depend on the surface properties; therefore, the AFM
results can be directly used to qualitatively evaluate and compare
the surface energy of different materials.

All of the aforementioned
methods have their own advantages and
limitations, and no single method is sufficient for accurate assessment
of surface energy. Despite all theoretical and experimental works
performed to determine the surface energy of solid surfaces, only
a few studies have been conducted to measure the surface energy of
minerals, particularly rare earth minerals, which are the major focus
of this paper. The majority of the published research work in this
area has been devoted to study the hydrophobic characteristics of
mineral surfaces and its impact on their floatability,24,25 which is insufficient to draw an accurate conclusion about the surface
energy since it ignored other important components that contribute
to the total energy of a mineral surface. For example, several studies
concluded that many sulfide minerals are floatable without using a
collector due to the low degree of surface polarity and the large
degree of hydrophobicity.26 However, the
surface oxidation and the possible hydrolysis of metal sulfides make
it difficult to generalize the wetting analysis achieved by these
studies.24 Other researchers studied the
surface properties of clay minerals where contact angle measurement
and atomic force microscopy have been used to analyze the wetting
characteristics.27 However, results showed
a large variation in surface properties as the clay minerals and layered
silicates are anisotropic in nature.28,29 Variation
of surface energy values and its dependence on isomorphic substitution
and mineral composition of clays have made the molecular dynamics
simulation (MDS) an attractive tool for surface analysis of layered
silicates.30 However, MDS has been employed
as a supportive tool for experimental techniques, although it can
simulate different conditions and predict the surface characteristics.
In the case of rare earth minerals, the data on surface characteristics
is scarce. The flotation of bastnaesite and xenotime has been investigated,
but the surface energy and its constituents has not been reported.
Previous work focused on studying the surface chemistry of rare earth
minerals in connection with the flotation process using ζ-potential
measurements and analysis of reagents’ adsorption on surfaces.31−33 As concluded from the previous examples, there is a lack of reliable
assessment of the surface energy of minerals, especially rare earth
minerals. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to provide
comprehensive investigations on the surface energy and wettability
characteristics of two primary rare earth minerals; bastnaesite and
xenotime, as the main commercial sources of light and heavy rare earth
elements, respectively.

In this study, three powerful techniques
have been used to determine
and compare the total surface energy, and its polar and nonpolar components,
of bastnaesite and xenotime: contact angle measurement, atomic force
microscopy (AFM), and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). In addition,
the orientation of crystal’s of the two minerals was identified
using surface X-ray diffraction analysis, whereas the morphology and
elemental composition were characterized using field emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with an EDAX energy dispersive
system. The findings of this paper will provide a deeper understanding
of the types of surface-active forces that govern the surface reactions
of rare earth minerals, which is crucial to design more efficient
chemicals, reagents, and processes for the separation and recovery
of rare earth elements. To the bests of authors’ knowledge,
no such a comprehensive experimental study exists in the literature
on the surface energy analyses of rare earth minerals.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Two
major rare earth minerals,
bastnaesite and xenotime (as the main sources for light and heavy
rare earth elements), were used in this study. Bastnaesite (REE)CO2F and xenotime YPO4 were obtained from Zagi Mountain
in Pakistan and Bahia in Brazil, respectively. Both mineral samples
were highly crystalline. The surface of mineral specimens was sequentially
polished by 800, 1200, and 2400 grit silicon carbide grinding papers.
When passing from one polishing paper to the next finer grade, the
polished samples were immersed in and rinsed with acetone, ethanol,
and deionized water to remove any traces of contaminants and polishing
powder. This procedure was followed by drying the samples in the oven
at 50 °C. Five probe liquids with known surface energy components
were used for contact angle measurement and surface energy analysis:
distilled water, formamide (>99.5%), ethylene glycol (99.8%), nitromethane
(99.9%), and undecane (>99%), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St.
Louis, MO). The surface tension components of the used probe liquids
are presented in Table 1.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Surface Characterization
2.2.1.1 X-ray
Crystallography
The surface
properties of a mineral can change depending on the crystallographic
face studied. The surfaces of bastnaesite and xenotime used for contact
angle measurements were first characterized by surface X-ray diffraction
analysis for the determination of crystal face orientation. X-ray
intensity data were collected using an X’PERT PRO diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation, Kα = 1.54439 Å. Data were recorded
between 5 and 90 2θ with a scan step size of 0.03. The bastnaesite
had a hexagonal structure with the space group P6̅2c, whereas xenotime had a tetragonal structure with the
space group I41/amd. Figure 1 shows the X-ray patterns of
the rare earth crystals and the Miller indices of the surfaces used
for contact angle measurement. The morphology of both minerals was
dominated by {1 0 0} surfaces. Xenotime surface consisted of a regular
rare earth oxides polyhedron accommodating small rare earth cations
(yttrium and heavy rare earth elements). Bastnaesite consisted of
two alternate layers of three rare earth fluorides and three carbonate
groups.

2.2.1.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
and Energy
Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM–EDS)
It is well known
that the morphology of mineral surfaces has a strong effect on the
contact angle measurements. Therefore, the morphology of rare earth
mineral surfaces was examined at microscale using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). Hitachi S-4700 field emission scanning electron
microscope (FESEM) equipped with an EDAX energy dispersive X-ray unit
was used in this study since is capable to determine the chemical
composition of the samples as well. The region evaluated with FESEM
was analyzed with energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) to determine
the specific elements that comprise the surface of the minerals. Figure 2 illustrates a relatively
smooth topography of the surfaces with the roughness around 10 nm.
The spectrum of X-ray intensity versus energy level indicated that
yttrium and heavy rare earth elements (mainly erbium, gadolinium,
and ytterbium) were the dominant rare earth elements of the xenotime
surface. EDS analysis indicated that three light rare earth elements,
namely, cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium were the dominant elements
of bastnaesite surface.

and (b) xenotime.

2.2.1.3 Atomic
Force Microscopy (AFM) Imaging
The surface topography of
rare earth mineral surfaces was examined
using a dual-probe atomic force microscope (DP-AFM). The AFM mapping
was performed in contact mode using a VIT_P_C-A silicon cantilever
(NT-MDT Spectrum Instruments) with force constant of 0.6–1
N/m and a pyramidal tip with the height of 15 μm. The scan was
made over a 1 × 1 μm surface near the edge of the crystals
where the three-phase contact line may take place in contact angle
measurements (Figure 3). The samples were flat having irregularities around the edge; however,
the surface roughness of bastnaesite was slightly larger than that
of xenotime.

2.2.2 Wettability and Surface
Energy Analysis
2.2.2.1 Sessile Drop Contact
Angle Measurements
Contact angle measurements were carried
out on the surface of the
polished and cleaned rare earth crystals by the sessile drop (solid/liquid/air
system) method using a Ramé-Hart model 500 Advanced Goniometer.
A drop of probe liquid was gently deposited at ambient conditions
on the mineral surfaces using a microliter syringe, and the right,
left and average angles were measured using the DropImage software.
The measurements were repeated for four times, and the variation was
in the range of ±(1–4) degrees. The obtained contact angles
were used for surface energy analysis.

2.2.2.2 Surface
Energy Calculations by Contact
Angle Measurement
The surface energy of solid surfaces can
be evaluated by studying the wetting behavior of liquids on the solid
sample. Wetting behavior is commonly studied by measuring the contact
angle and the thermodynamic equilibrium between the liquid, solid,
and gas or vapor phases (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Schematic showing the relationship between contact angle
and interfacial
tensions.

Young proposed a mathematical
expression, which correlates the
contact angle θ with the surface energy of solid γs, the surface energy of liquid γl, and the
interfacial energy γsl, between liquid and solid34 1  The problem with the Young equation is that
the γs and γsl cannot be directly
determined. In this regard, Dupre introduced the concepts of work
of adhesion between phase a and phase b35 2  If the phase “a”
is solid and
the phase “b” is liquid, then by substituting eq 1, the Young equation, into eq 2, the Young–Dupre
equation would be obtained 3  The work of cohesion of a solid or liquid
can be similarly defined 4   5  Based on Berthelot’s assumption, the
adhesion work between the solid and liquid Wsl is equal to the geometric mean of the cohesion work of a
solid and liquid individually 6  Combining
the eqs 3–6 results in eq 7, which is the basis of
surface energy calculations 7  Several models and approaches have been developed
based on the contact angle measurement to derive the expressions for
surface energy calculation. These models are based on different viewpoints;
however, none of them is universal and ideally match the reality.
Since the surface energy of a mineral is not an exact and absolute
value, five commonly accepted models, Fowkes, Van Oss–Chaudhury–Good,
Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble, Zisman, and Neumann
models, were used in this study to calculate the surface energy of
rare earth minerals from contact angle data. Authors believe that
this approach could provide more reliable information on the polar
and nonpolar components of the surface energy of bastnaesite and xenotime.

2.2.2.3 Surface Energy Analysis by Atomic Force
Microscopy
The interaction between the AFM tip and the mineral
substrate was analyzed by measuring the deflection of the cantilever.
The force curves were obtained by plotting the cantilever’s
deflection against the distance of the tip from the sample. Force
curves were used to evaluate the forces applied to the surface and
compare the type of interactions taking place on the mineral surfaces. Figure 5a schematically shows
the deflection of the cantilever as well as the tip and the cantilever
used in this paper.

Figure 5 (a) SEM micrographs of the cantilever used in this study
and a
schematic showing the cantilever deflection; (b) a schematic showing
AFM force curve obtained from the measurement of the cantilever deflection.

In Figure 5b, a
scheme of the force curve is presented. As shown, two plots were obtained
from the measurement of cantilever deflection. In the region 1–2,
there was no interaction between the tip and the solid surface since
the tip was not close enough to the solid surface. As the tip approached
the sample, the tip was pulled down in the region 2–3 due to
the attraction forces. The cantilever bent upward in the region 3–4
as the tip passed into the surface. In the region 4–5, the
tip retracted, and cantilever began to relax until the tip force got
in equilibrium with the forces on the surface of the sample. In region
5–6, retraction continued, and the cantilever bent downward
as the sample surface tried to attract the tip. There was no interaction
in region 7–8 as the tip was completely separated.

In
this paper, the force curves were plotted for both bastnaesite
and xenotime to obtain the work of adhesion and qualitatively compare
the surface energy of the two minerals. The instrument was operated
in the contact mode to measure the positive deflection of the cantilever.
The pull-off force (adhesion force) was calculated using Hooke’s
law, F = KZ, where K is the spring constant of the cantilever and Z is
the deflection of the cantilever during the contact between the tip
and mineral surfaces. Then two models of contact mechanics (Deryaguin–Muller–Toporov36 and Johnson–Kendall–Roberts37) were employed to convert the pull-off force
into the work of adhesion.

2.2.2.4 Surface Energy Analysis
by Inverse Gas
Chromatography
IGC is a physicochemical, gas–solid
technique for the determination of surface and bulk properties of
powders and particulates. A schematic showing the principle of inverse
gas chromatography (IGC) for surface energy measurement is presented
in Figure 6. The vapor
probes with known properties were passed through the chromatography
column packed with the mineral powder. A series of nonpolar probes
(n-alkanes) were injected, and their retention time
was measured. The retention time was a result of adsorption and desorption
of the probe molecules on the mineral surface. The probe molecules
desorbed from the mineral surface were detected by the flame ionization
detector, and the retention time was determined. The retention time
was then converted to the surface energy by applying the Dorris–Gray
and Schultz approaches.38,39 The relationship between
the retention volume and dispersive component of surface energy can
be determined using eq 8 8  where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, VR0 is the retention
volume, NA is the Avogadro’s constant,
and a is the cross-sectional area of the probe molecule.
The retention volume is determined from the retention time using eq 9. 9  where j is the James–Martin
pressure correction factor, which corrects the retention time and
makes the retention volume independent of pressure, m is the mass of sample, F is the exit flow rate, tR is the retention time for the adsorbing probe, t0 is the hold-up time of the mobile phase, and T is the temperature of the column.

If the left side
of eq 8 is plotted versus a(γlD)1/2 for a series of alkanes, the slope of the
straight line will allow the calculation of dispersive component of
surface energy. To determine the acid–base component, polar
probe molecules were injected. The data points related to the polar
probe molecules were located beyond the alkane line. The vertical
distance between the polar points and alkane line represents the specific
component of the Gibbs free energy, ΔG. The
electron-acceptor and -donor values were obtained from the Gibbs free
energy by applying the Good-van Oss concept (eq 10), and then the acid–base component
was estimated by using the geometric mean of the γS+ and γS– parameters
(eq 11). 10   11

principle of inverse gas chromatography (IGC)
for surface energy measurement.

3 Results and Discussion
The values of the contact angle of probe liquids on mineral surfaces
were plotted as a function of time from 0 to 60 s (Figure 7), and the relative equilibrium
contact angle was used to calculate the surface energy of rare earth
minerals. As shown in Figure 7, the contact angle values of all liquids on bastnaesite were
greater than those on xenotime. Unlike water, the contact angle of
formamide decreased as time increased due to the stronger bonding
mechanism, which reduced the interfacial energy through acid–base
interactions. Undecane is a nonpolar liquid that has a lower surface
tension, which resulted in a smaller contact angle in comparison with
polar probes. Contact angle values obtained with nitromethane for
bastnaesite and xenotime were close to each other, and the contact
angle values obtained with undecane were similar for both rare earth
minerals.

for (a) bastnaesite and (b) xenotime.

Even though the result of contact angle measurements may vary depending
on the experimental methodology, this technique is widely accepted
for comparative assessment of surface properties of solid materials.
In this study, contact angle values were used to analyze the surface
energy of bastnaesite and xenotime by the means of Fowkes, Van Oss–Chaudhury–Good,
Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble, Zisman, and Neumann
models.

According to the Fowkes model,12 the
surface energy of solids and liquids can be dissociated to the independent
components. Fowkes theory assumes that the total surface energy of
a solid is the sum of the polar and dispersive (nonpolar) components 12  where d and
p are the dispersive and polar
components, respectively. Combining eqs 7 and 12 makes it possible to
express the work of adhesion, yielding the surface energy components 13  Figure 8 shows the values of the surface
free energy and its dispersive
and polar components obtained from Fowkes model for rare earth minerals.
As it is shown, the dispersive portion was much larger than nondispersive
part for both bastnaesite and xenotime. The dispersive portion was
due to London forces, which resulted from instantaneous dipole-induced
dipole forces. The London dispersion forces are always present in
all types of materials and take place at the liquid–solid interfaces,
even though the dispersive forces might be weaker than other intermolecular
forces. Dispersive energy of the xenotime was larger than that of
bastnaesite, whereas the polar components were close to each other.
This observation was a result of the difference in the ionization
energies of elements on bastnaesite and xenotime surfaces, which would
influence their surfaces’ reactivity. The polar component results
from Coulomb interactions between permanent dipoles, permanent dipoles
and induced dipoles. In fact, if two phases, which are in contact,
have an equal or similar ratio of dispersive to polar components,
the interaction between two phases will be larger.

Figure 8 Polar, dispersive, and
total surface energy of rare earth minerals
obtained by the Fowkes model.

The Fowkes theory is based on the additivity of the polar (acid–base)
and apolar (Lifshitz–van der Waals) interactions. However,
the electron-acceptor and electron-donor constituents of the polar
component of the surface energy are not additive.

Van Oss, Chaudhury
proposed another approach to include the hydrogen-bond
interactions in the surface energy calculations.40 According to vOCG model, the surface energy consists of
apolar component (wherein Lifshitz–van der Waals interactions
including dispersion and induced dipole–dipole interactions
take place) and polar component (wherein Lewis acid–base interactions
including hydrogen-bond interactions take place). The equation proposed
by vOCG model for solid and liquid surface energies is 14  Figure 9 shows the values of electron-donor
and electron-acceptor
parameters as well as apolar (Lifshitz–van der Waals) component
of the surface energy for both bastnaesite and xenotime. As shown
in Figure 9, the Lifshitz–van
der Waals interactions for xenotime were about three times greater
than that of bastnaesite. The electron-donor parameter (Lewis base,
γ–) value of xenotime was close to zero, whereas
its electron-acceptor parameter (Lewis acid, γ+)
was 6.6 mJ m–2. According to the vOCG model, although
the xenotime surface seemed to be monopolar, the bastnaesite had a
bipolar surface. The results obtained by Van Oss–Chaudhury–Good
model confirmed that the acid–base interactions between rare
earth minerals and tested probe liquids were small, and the Lifshitz–van
der Waals interactions dominated. However, the calculated values of
surface energy components may vary depending on the choice of probe
liquids.

Figure 9 Polar (acid–base) and apolar (Lifshitz–van der Waals)
components of the surface energy of rare earth minerals obtained by
Van Oss–Chaudhury–Good model.

Owens, Wendt, Rabel, and Kaelble considered the geometric mean
of the dispersive and nondispersive parts of the solid and liquid
surface energies41−43 15  Substituting eq 15 in Young’s equation
yields 16  Dispersive and polar components of the surface
energy of rare earth minerals were evaluated by plotting the left
side of eq 16 versus . Creating the linear regression
of the
data and the determination of slope and Y-intercept
allowed to determine the polar and dispersive portions of surface
energy, respectively. In the case of solids having a low polar part,
the amount of (γspγlp)1/2 will be reduced, and, consequently, the contribution
of the polar interactions will decrease.

Figure 10 shows
the polar and dispersive energies of bastnaesite and xenotime obtained
by the OWRK method. The dispersive energies of bastnaesite and xenotime
obtained by this method were relatively equal. Both polar and dispersive
energies of xenotime obtained by OWRK model were close to those calculated
by Fowkes model. In fact, the assumptions made in these two models
are similar. The OWRK and Fowkes models are mathematically identical,
but the way that the OWRK model uses for surface energy calculation
is based on the graphical evaluation. However, in the case of bastnaesite,
the dispersive energy obtained by OWRK model was larger than that
calculated by Fowkes model, whereas the polar surface energy was smaller.
According to the surface energy values obtained by Van Oss–Chaudhury–Good
model, the polar energy of the rare earth minerals was small, so the
(γspγlp)1/2 in the OWRK model assumed a low value. Hence, the polar interactions
had a small contribution to the interfacial tension between the rare
earth minerals and the probe liquids. The polar component in the OWRK
model accounts for site-specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding
and Coulomb interactions between dipoles (dipole–dipole and
dipole-induced dipole). The OWRK model has been proven to provide
acceptable results for different solid surfaces, however, it has also
been reported that this model is unable to cover all of the nondispersive
interactions.

(b) xenotime obtained by the Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble
model.

Although the dispersive component
exists in all models developed
for surface energy calculations, the definition and origin of the
second component are still under debate. Neumann’s equation
of state addressed this challenge by not separating the surface energy
into several interactions.44 Neumann et
al. assumed that the interfacial energy between solid and liquid,
γsl, depends only on the surface energy of the solid
and the liquid. The formula based on Neumann’s equation of
state expresses the relation between contact angle, solid surface
energy, and liquid surface energy as follows 17  where β is a modification constant to
address the errors made by unlike-pair interactions between solid
and liquid. The total surface energy of bastnaesite and xenotime was
determined by solving the eq 17 for each probe liquid. In Table 2, the total surface energy of rare earth
minerals calculated by Neumann’s equation of state is presented.
As it is seen, the surface energy values of bastnaesite and xenotime
were in the range of 22–29 and 24–35 mJ m–2, respectively. Neumann’s model is controversial due to not
considering the statistical thermodynamics and origin of the molecules,
which are the basis for the geometric approach. Each probe liquid
gives unique surface energy, which does not include the dispersive
and polar components; however, the Neumann’s model well indicated
how the probe liquid can affect the surface energy value. In fact,
the competition between the solid–liquid adhesive forces and
cohesive interactions in the probe liquid determines the shape of
the drop and, thus, contact angle value.

Other than Neumann’s equation of state, the
Zisman model
is also another one-parameter model.45 According
to Zisman’s theory, the surface energy of a solid is simply
equal to the surface energy of the liquid that can completely wet
the solid surface and make a contact angle of 00. This
is due to the fact that the contact angle decreases as the surface
energy of liquid decreases. The contact angle data for five probe
liquids on rare earth minerals was acquired, and then the cosine of
contact angle values (cos θ) against known surface energy
of probe liquids was plotted and extrapolated to cos θ
= 1 (θ = 00). In Figure 11, the Zisman plots for bastnaesite and xenotime
are shown. The Zisman plot shows that the surface energies of bastnaesite
and xenotime were 23.8 and 22 mJ m–2, respectively.
It should be noted that the energy obtained by the Zisman method is
called “critical surface energy”, which is different
from the surface energy γs, calculated by other methods.
The Zisman’s critical surface energy is assumed to be equal
to the surface tension of the liquid, which makes zero contact angle
with the solid surface. In fact, the Zisman method works better for
nonpolar surfaces and is inadequate for the surfaces such as rare
earth minerals, which have some polar energies as well.

the Zisman model.

Despite all of the advantages
of the contact angle measurement
technique, the surface energy calculated by the relevant models is
dependent on the selected probe liquids. Atomic force microscopy has
been recently used to measure the tip–substrate forces to determine
the surface energy without the interference of probe liquids. In this
paper, the same planes of bastnaesite and xenotime used for contact
angle studies were used for the AFM analysis. The measurements were
conducted at ambient conditions and controlled humidity. The pull-off
force depends on the probe size and the tip radius, which determine
the contact area. The length of the probe was ≈450 μm
and the width was 50 μm. The tip had a pyramidal shape with
a curvature radius 10 nm. A typical force–distance curve obtained
for the {100} faces of rare earth minerals using a silicon nonfunctionalized
tip is shown in Figure 12. The approach curve was flat for both rare earth minerals
until the long-range forces were absent, and jump-to contact was reached.
The tip jumped to contact on xenotime surface when the tip–surface
distance was about 2370 nm, whereas this value was about 2250 nm for
bastnaesite. A slight sublinearity was observed, possibly indicating
an elastic deformation of the crystals. After the tip jumps to contact,
the repulsive interaction took place, and as the tip moved inward,
the cantilever started to bend. The maximum deflections of the cantilever
were ≈1460 and 1150 nm for xenotime and bastnaesite, respectively.
As the cantilever retracted the reverse phenomenon took place and
finally the tip jumped off the surface when the spring force of the
cantilever overcame the tip–mineral adhesion force. The pull-off
force was calculated based on Hook’s law and the jump-off contact
minimum. The pull-off forces obtained for xenotime and bastnaesite
were 24 and 15 nN, respectively. Two contact mechanics models, Johnson–Kendall–Roberts
(JKR) and Deryaguin–Muller–Toporov (DMT), were employed
to convert the pull-off force to the work of adhesion. The work of
adhesion is directly proportional to the surface energy of the rare
earth minerals. According to JKR model, the pull-off force (F) is correlated with the work of adhesion (WA) by 18  according to the DMT model, the pull-off force
is given as 19  where R is the radius of
the probe tip.

Figure 12 Force curves showing the interactions between the AFM
probe and
(a) bastnaesite surface and (b) xenotime surface.

The work of adhesion obtained by JKR and DMT models for xenotime
was 1.6 times higher than that calculated for bastnaesite, which was
comparable with the results obtained by Fowkes and OWRK models used
in the contact angle measurements. However, the AFM technique, in
this study, was only used for qualitative analysis and comparison
of rare earth minerals’ wettability since the surface energy
values obtained by AFM technique should be regarded with caution due
to the inconsistency and irreproducibility of the results. The variation
in surface roughness and heterogeneity characteristics as well as
the probe imperfection caused irreproducibility of the surface energy
values.

Mineral surfaces are usually heterogeneous, therefore
a single
value for surface energy cannot represent the whole surface. Inverse
gas chromatography (IGC) was employed to get more information on the
underlying heterogeneity of the rare earth minerals to provide a more
realistic surface energetics data. Although the contact angle measurements
and the atomic force microscopy were applied on the rare earth crystalline
faces, the IGC analysis was applied on the rare earth mineral powders.
The surface energies for both bastnaesite and xenotime were calculated
at identical coverages from 0.01 to 0.15 n/nm. Figure 13 shows the profile of dispersive surface
energy, specific (acid–base) surface energy, and total surface
energy for rare earth minerals measured by the IGC technique. It is
observed that the surface energy of both minerals decreased as the
surface coverage increased; however, the variation of surface energy
values was not large. As shown in Figure 13a, the dispersive surface energy of xenotime
was greater than that of bastnaesite within the surface coverages
0.01–0.05 n/nm, then they became closer as the surface
coverages increased. The dispersive surface energy for xenotime was
in the range of 37–48 mJ m–2 and for bastnaesite
was in the range of 37–43 mJ m–2, which are
obviously larger than what obtained by contact angle measurements
and relative models. In fact, the higher energy sites made a larger
contribution in comparison with the lower energy sites of the mineral
surfaces; therefore, the dispersive energy obtained by IGC was higher
compared to the values achieved by the contact angle measurements.

Dispersive, (b) acid–base, and (c) total surface energy
profile of rare earth minerals obtained from the IGC analysis.

The specific component of surface energy, also
called acid–base
contribution to the surface energy, was determined by measuring the
retention time of dichloromethane (monopolar Lewis acid) and ethyl
acetate (monopolar Lewis base), As shown in Figure 13b, the acid–base surface energy of
bastnaesite was larger than that of xenotime, which was in agreement
with the results obtained by the vOCG model used in the contact angle
measurement study. According to the IGC results, the acid–base
surface energy for xenotime was in the range of 3–8 mJ m–2 and for bastnaesite was in the range of 3.5–9
mJ m–2. Acid–base surface interactions are
comprised of electron-acceptor (Lewis acid) and electron-donor (Lewis
base) parameters. Based on the vOCG model used in contact angle measurements
and the geometric mean of the γS+ and γS– parameters, the γAB for bastnaesite was 8.6 mJ m–2 and for xenotime
was 3.2 mJ m–2. However, the contact angle measurements
and the vOCG model demonstrated that the Lewis acidic portion made
a larger contribution to the specific component of the surface energy
of xenotime.

4 Conclusions
Surface
energy and wettability of bastnaesite and xenotime, as
major commercial sources of heavy and light rare earth elements, were
investigated and compared using a combination of techniques including
contact angle measurement, atomic force microscopy, and inverse gas
chromatography. Contact angle-based models revealed notable differences
in dispersive and polar surface energy constituents of rare earth
minerals. The results obtained by these models were dependent on the
type of probe liquid used. However, surface roughness, local properties,
and composition variation seemed to have a greater impact on the surface
energy analysis of the two minerals studied. According to contact
angle measurements, bastnaesite exhibited a more hydrophobic character
and had relatively smaller total and dispersive surface energy values.
The assumptions made in Fowkes and OWRK models are similar; however,
the results obtained by these two models were slightly different.
In the OWRK model, the surface energy values were calculated based
on the graphical evaluation. Both polar and dispersive energies of
xenotime obtained by OWRK model were close to those calculated by
Fowkes model, but in the case of bastnaesite, the dispersive energy
obtained by OWRK model was larger than that calculated by Fowkes model,
whereas the polar surface energy was smaller. Results obtained using
Zisman model showed that this model is inadequate for probing mineral
surfaces with polar characteristics. Neumann’s equation of
state, a one-parameter model, showed better performance for the mineral
surfaces when polar probes were used for calculations. In the vOCG
model, the hydrogen-bond interactions were included in the surface
energy calculations. Based on this model, xenotime displayed a smaller
acid–base surface energy, which was in agreement with IGC results.
The work of adhesion obtained from the force curve analysis revealed
a higher wettability for xenotime, supporting the results achieved
by contact angle measurements. The specific and nonspecific surface
energy of bastnaesite and xenotime were measured by inverse gas chromatography
to take the surface heterogeneity into consideration. IGC results
showed a relatively higher dispersive surface energy values in comparison
with contact angle measurements due to the larger contribution of
higher energy sites in IGC technique. However, the polar surface energy
obtained by IGC technique was relatively close to those calculated
by contact angle models. It should be noted that the complexity of
the polar and nonpolar interfacial interactions makes it very difficult
to provide a secure basis for getting a simple conclusion on the surface
energy of rare earth minerals. This paper demonstrates that using
a single technique cannot provide reliable data on the surface energy
of minerals, but using a combination of techniques and models gives
a better understanding of surface chemistry of solid materials.
