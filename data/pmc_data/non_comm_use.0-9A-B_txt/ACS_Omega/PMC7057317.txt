polarized luminescence (CPL) is characterized by the differential
emission of right and left circularly polarized light by a chiral
molecule. This mini-review describes the recent developments in chiral
trivalent europium (Eu(III)) complexes with effective CPL. CPL has
many potential applications in security tags, lasers, and three-dimensional
organic electroluminescence devices, which is one of the most intensely
investigated topics in molecular luminophores. Eu(III) complexes have
attracted considerable attention as effective CPL luminophores for
the above-mentioned applications. In this review, recent studies on
the Eu(III) CPL, including the steric (dimer, tetramer, aggregates,
and coordination polymers) and electronic control (mononuclear) of
Eu(III) complexes for the construction of a luminophore with effective
CPL, are discussed. The characteristic CPL applications employing
the chiral mononuclear Eu(III) complexes are also described. Chiral
Eu(III) complexes with well-designed organic ligands can result in
the establishment of new research areas in the fields of photochemistry
and materials science.

1 Introduction
Chiral molecules exhibit
circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), which is characterized by
the differential emission of right- and left-handed circularly polarized
light.1,2 CPL has attracted considerable attention
owing to its applications in security tags, lasers, and organic electroluminescent
(EL) devices for 3D displays.3 Many studies
on various chiral luminophores such as organic dyes, transition-metal
complexes, and lanthanide metal complexes have been reported. Among
these chiral luminophores, enantiopure lanthanide complexes exhibit
the most effective CPL as chiral luminophores.4−7

Lanthanoids include La and
14 other elements (lanthanides: Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy,
Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) (Figure 1a), which form stable trivalent ions. Chiral lanthanide(III)
complexes are composed of lanthanide(III) ions (i.e., a luminescent
center) and organic ligands (i.e., chiral indicators) as shown in Figure 1b. The trivalent
lanthanide ions are characterized by an incompletely filled 4f shell
(with the exception of La(III) and Lu(III)). The 4f orbital is shielded
from the surroundings by the filled 5s and 5p orbitals. On the basis
of the electronic characteristics, 4f–4f transitions produce
sharp emission lines (full width at half-maximum, fwhm <10 nm),
which is considerably different from the emission properties of the
organic dyes and transition-metal complexes.7−10 Chiral ligands induce a high
CPL activity for the 4f–4f transition.

periodic table and (b) image of the chiral lanthanide luminophore
([Eu((+)-hfbc)4]−) with high CPL activity.

Herein, we introduce the history of the studies
on CPL using the lanthanide complex. In 1975, Richardson et al. discovered
CPL in Eu(III) and Tb(III) complexes with chiral carboxylic acid for
the first time.11 Following
this discovery, they also observed high CPL activity in a Eu(III)
complex with chiral 3-trifluoroacetylcamphorate
ligands,12 and there are several reports
on CPL.13,14 During that time, the reports on the CPL
were limited because of the weak effect and the lack of conventional
measurement systems. In the 21st century, the CPL measurement systems
became widespread, resulting in a gradual increase in the number of
CPL reports. In 2011, Kaizaki and Muller reported the chiroptical
properties of Cs[Eu((+)-hfbc)4] (hfbc: 3-heptafluoro butyryl
camphorate).15 The emission intensity (in
the 5D0 → 7F1 transition)
of the left-handed light is approximately 5 times greater than that
of the right-handed light. This finding further accelerated the CPL
research on lanthanide(III) complexes. Various studies on lanthanide
CPLs are summarized in several reviews by Muller,4 Parker,5 and Di Bari.6 The focus of this review is on the latest progress
in polynuclear Eu(III) CPL and the electronic control of chiral mononuclear
Eu(III) complexes to realize effective CPL. The CPL applications using
the chiral mononuclear Eu(III) complexes are also described.

2 General Theory
CPL spectroscopy measures the difference
between the intensities (ΔI) of the left (IL) and right (IR) circularly polarized emissions from the chiral luminophore, which
is defined by following equation.1,2 1  The degree of dissymmetry of CPL is quantified
by the difference in the relative intensities of the left and right
circularly polarized emissions and is known as the luminescence dissymmetry
factor (gCPL). 2  By definition, the gCPL values should
be in the range of −2 to +2. gCPL is also expressed in terms of the transition electric dipole moment μ⃗ and transition magnetic dipole moment m⃗ as shown below 3  where θ
is the angle between μ⃗ and m⃗. When μ⃗ = m⃗ (θ = 0, eq 3 affords the highest gCPL value (= 2) mathematically. The equation indicates that the lanthanide(III)
complexes are plausible candidates for CPL with high gCPL values because the magnitude of the electric dipole
moment (μ⃗) is similar to that of the
magnetic dipole moment (|m⃗|). Among lanthanide(III)
emissions, the 5D0 → 7F1 transition of Eu(III) complexes shows an enormous gCPL based on the allowed magnetic dipole nature.

3 Steric Structural Control by Molecular Integration
In contrast to many reports for the lanthanide CPL based on mononuclear
complexes,4−6 few reports exist on the polynuclear lanthanide CPL.
Polynuclear complexes show interor intramolecular interaction by integration.
Herein, recent progress in the lanthanide CPL from Eu(III) tetramers,16 dimers,17 aggregates,18 and coordination polymers19,20 is reviewed.

3.1 Highly Active CPL for the Eu(III) Tetramer
and Dimer
Morphology control on the molecular scale can produce
effetive CPL properties. Teat demonstrated that the point chirality
of a ligand decisively influenced its supramolecular assembly behavior.16 They produced a Eu(III) tetrahedral cage using
2,6-diaminoanthraquinone-based chiral ligands with
different point chirality (Figure 2). Ligand 1 (Figure 2) allowed the formation of highly diastereoselective
Eu tetrahedral cages, although ligands 2 and 3 (Figure 2) led to
the generation of a mixture of isomers. The homochiral cages exhibit
excellent CPL (|gCPL|: up to 0.16), but
other cages show relatively low gCPL values.
All cages show the same long emission lifetimes (1.6 ms). From these
results, we consider that the cages do not exhibit the quenching states
around the emitting level of the Eu(III) ion. The cage framework also
shows effective energy transfer and a high emission quantum yield
(Φtot = 16–18%). These results
(different CPLs and similar Φtot’s) indicate that the precise steric control of the Eu(III)
cage system provides the effective chiroptical change in the solution.

chiral Eu(III) complexes.

A characteristic CPL luminophore was also reported for the dynamic
CPL control using a photochemical reaction. The combination of Eu(III)
complexes and photochromic chiral molecule induces unique chiroptical
phenomena. Nakashima and Kawai reported the photoswitching of the
CPL property in the Eu(III) dimer system (Figure 3).17 The Eu(III)
complex shows nine coordination structures composed of β-diketonate
and terpyridine derivative with a chiral photochromic unit. The Eu(III)
complexes were arranged closely in a chiral orientation by the unit.
This structural modulation also induces emission intensity change
based on the back-energy transfer from the Eu(III) ion to the photochromic
unit. The chiral arrangement of the complex units was switched by
a photoinduced structural change in the system, resulting in on–off
switching of the CPL with high contrast (gCPL values of 0.1 and <0.01). Nanoscale studies on the chiroptical
properties of a chiral Eu(III) complex have been recently explored,
although numerous studies have been historically carried out on chiral
dye oligomers based on the coupled exciton theory.3

3.2 Enhanced CPL for Eu(III) Aggregation and Coordination
Polymers
Polynuclear Eu(III) complexes show highly active
circular polarized emission as described in the last chapter. Recently,
enhanced gCPL through the aggregation
of chiral units was also reported for the chiral Eu(III) complex with
3-heptafluorobutyryl camphorate (hfbc) and the Cs(I) ion
(Figure 4a).18 The helical 1D aggregation of Cs[Eu((+)–hfbc)4] resulted in the highest gCPL value (1.45: 5D0 → 7F1 transition), although gCD (π–π*
transition) of Cs[Eu((+)–hfbc)4] was the same as
the aggregates. The emission intensity of the left-handed light is
approximately 6 times larger than that of the right-handed light,
which allowed the visualization of CPL with the naked eye using circularly
polarized filters.

Figure 4 (a) Supramolecular and (b, c) coordination-polymer-type
chiral Eu(III) complexes.18−20

Compared to the large gCPL of the Eu(III)
complexes with chiral β-diketonate ligands that contain a camphorate
framework, the emission quantum yields are extremely low because of
the existence of an energy quenching state for the emissive Eu(III)
ion (1D aggregation of Cs[Eu((+)–hfbc)4]; emission
quantum yield, Φtot = 1%).18 Our research group determined that the spiral
polymerization of the Eu(III) complex with 3-trifluoroacetyl camphorate
significantly increased the emission quantum yield.19 Herein, the Eu(III) coordination polymers were composed
of chiral Eu(tfc)3 [tfc = 3-trifluoroacetylcamphorate)
and dpbp joint ligand, [Eu(±tfc)3(dpbp)]n (dpbp = 4,4′-bis(diphenylphosphoryl)biphenyl), Figure 4b]. The tight packing
of the Eu(III) coordination polymer afforded enhanced thermostability
(332 °C). The rigid spiral-type chiral Eu(III) coordination polymer
exhibited strong luminescence (Φtot = 30%) and high CPL activity (gCPL =
0.16) in comparison to those of the mononuclear chiral Eu(III) complex
[Eu(tfc)3(tppo)2, tppo = triphenylphosphine
oxide] in the solid state. The high Φtot is due to an effective photosensitized efficiency (ηsens = 53%) and internal emission quantum yield obtained
by excitation of the lanthanide ion (Φff = 57%). The modulation of the ligand electronic structure
through molecular integration is also presumed to suppress the energy
quenching from the emissive Eu(III) ion, which results in a high emission
quantum yield. The spiral coordinated Eu(III) polymer with the chiral
phosphine oxide ligands and achiral β-diketonate ligands was
also successfully synthesized by Hasegawa and co-workers (Figure 4c).20 The Eu(III) coordination polymer had a helical polymer
structure with the characteristic hydrogen–fluorine/π
interactions in the crystal. This polymer also exhibited high thermostability
(320 °C) and an extremely high emission quantum yield obtained
by the excitation of the lanthanide ion (Φff = 76%) in the solid state. The Eu(III) polymer shows an
effective transformation from a polymer to a monomer structure in
solution. This paper shows the gCPL (=
0.013) of the mononuclear structure in solution.

4 Electronic Structure Control for High CPL Activity
In section 3, the recent research
which describes the achievement of high CPL activity by steric control
through molecular integration is discussed. The CPL magnitude and
sign can also be affected by the chiral electronic structure of the
Eu(III) ion surrounded by external ligands in addition to the chiral
steric structure. The electronic structural modulation of chiral Eu(+tfc)3 complexes (Figure 5a, Eu(tfc)3+tppo and Eu(tfc)3+ac) provides
a dramatic change in the CPL property (Figure 5b). In this paper, large negative CPL signal
of Eu(tfc)3+ac at 594 nm was observed, although a small
positive signal for Eu(tfc)3+tppo was observed. The electronic
transitions at 583 nm of Eu(tfc)3+tppo and Eu(tfc)3+ac show the same CPL sign and similar magnitudes.

of the 5D0 → 7F1 transition of the Eu(III) complex (C4v or D2d) based on the electronic structure and group theory. Redrawn from
ref (21).

The characteristic photophysical phenomena was analyzed using
the eq 3 for gCPL. The equation can be modified as follows 4  where θ is the angle between μ⃗ and m⃗. In the region |μ⃗|/|m⃗| < 1, the Eu(III) complex with a
large |μ⃗| provides a high gCPL value (Figure 5c). In general, the |m⃗| value in
the 5D0 → 7F1 transition
is greater than the |μ⃗| value (|μ⃗|/|m⃗| < 1).22 Therefore, an enhanced |μ⃗| is important for the construction of the Eu(III) complex with large gCPL. The intensity of |μ⃗| in the 5D0 → 7F1 transition depends on the crystal field around the Eu(III) ion.23,24 The 7F1 energy level of the Eu(III) ion in
a typical eight-coordinate structure (C4v or D2d) splits into two Stark sublevels (Figure 5d).9 The two bands
at 583 and 594 nm in the CPL spectra are assigned to the A1 → A2 and A1 → E transitions,
respectively, in Figure 5d,e. The observed CPL signals for the A1 → E transition
are reversed for Eu(+tfc)3 with tppo compared to Eu(+tfc)3 with acetone, whereas those for the A1 →
A2 transition show the same minus sign for Eu(+tfc)3 with tppo and acetone.

In C4v or D2d symmetry, the direct product A2 (= A1 ×
A2) is expressed in terms of the ED-forbidden (ED: electric
dipole) and MD-allowed (MD: magnetic dipole) transitions on the character
table in group theory (Figure 5e). Alternately, the direct product E (= A1 ×
E) produces ED- and MD-allowed transitions (Figure 5e). The CPL sign at 583 nm (for the ED-forbidden
A1 → A2 transition) reflects the intrinsic
Λ- or Δ-type structure because of the insensitive electronic
state mixing. Considering the same CPL sign at 583 nm for Eu(+tfc)3 with tppo and acetone, the structure type (Λ or Δ)
with tppo is the same as that with acetone in the experiments. In
contrast, the CPL sign in the ED- and MD-allowed A1 →
E transition is sensitive to the electronic state mixing even for
the same chiral structure type (Λ or Δ).

The drastic
change in the intensity of the CPL signal in the A1 →
E transition is also considered to be caused by the change in μ⃗ based on electronic state mixing. In the 5D0 → 7F1 transition, μ⃗ is mainly altered by the J mixing of 7F2 or 7F3 sublevels into 7F1. In the photoluminescence spectra, the Stark
splitting energy of Eu(+tfc)3 with acetone is greater than
that of Eu(+tfc)3 with tppo. The large Stark splitting
energy suggests a large amount of J mixing in the A1 →
E transition of the Eu(III) complex with acetone. The J mixing increases
the |μ⃗| value of the ED-allowed A1 → E transition relative to that of the ED-forbidden
A1 → A2 transition. An increase in |μ⃗| results in a high gCPL value in eq 4. In the case of the previously reported mononuclear Eu(III) complexes
with chiral steric structures,15 a strong
A1 → E transition is also related to a large gCPL. The angle (θ) between μ⃗ and m⃗ for the Eu(tfc)3 complex
with acetone is greater than 90°, whereas that for the Eu(tfc)3 complex with tppo is less than 90°, suggesting that
the angle is established by the change in the μ⃗ vector due to J mixing. The significant enhancement of gCPL from +0.013 to −1.0 also indicates that J mixing
promotes the antiparallel direction of μ⃗ and m⃗, leading to a large gCPL. This paper demonstrates that the CPL sign and intensity
are strongly influenced by the chiral electronic structure depending
on μ⃗ under J mixing in the same chiral
structure type. This CPL study provides a novel aspect for the molecular
design of chiral Eu(III) complexes by maximizing the gCPL value and altering its sign. In the future, a detailed
description of the electronic structure based on calculation science25,26 may accelerate research on electronic structure control.

5 Recent CPL Applications
5.1 Recent CPL-Based Devices
Circularly polarized (CP) electroluminescence (CP-OLEDs) is rapidly
attracting considerable interest owing to its possible applications
in 3D displays. The development of more efficient CP-OLEDs is required
for such applications. Di Bari and co-workers found that the chiroptical
properties strongly depend on the thickness of Al as a cathode layer.
The authors also demonstrated that the chiral Eu complex-based CP-OLEDs
(Al thickness: 6 nm) show a remarkable CPL with a large dissymmetry
factor (gCPL = −1.0).27 Furthermore, the chiral Eu(III) complexes can
be applied not only to the electrical devices but also to the optical
devices. Parker demonstrated a chiral image contrast using Eu(III)
complexes with efficient light-absorption ability and a high emission
quantum yield for CPL microscopy (Figure 6b).28

Nakamura and Kobayashi described the DNA-based functional materials,
which are of significant interest for applications in electrical and
optical devices.29 They prepared novel
DNA-based photofunctional materials fabricated by the association
of a DNA–cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTMA) complex with
a luminescent Eu(III) complex. The emission intensity, quantum yield,
and thermal stability of the Eu(III) complex hosted by the DNA–CTMA
matrix were superior to those of the complex in a conventional poly(methyl
methacrylate) matrix. Furthermore, the Eu(III) complex in the DNA–CTMA
film also exhibited high CPL activity through the excitation of the
ligand moiety. The CPL originated from the chiral environment produced
by the DNA matrix. The composite films of DNA–CTMA and luminescent
lanthanide(III) complexes provide new insights for the construction
of materials with high CPL activity for future applications.

5.2 CPL-Based Monitoring Methods around the Lanthanide Ion
The effective Eu(III) CPL provides information about the chiral environment
around the Eu(III) ion. Researchers have developed CPL-based probes
for various organic compounds. Neil and co-workers successfully demonstrated
that CPL probes are useful for investigating the reversible binding
of anionic chiral species such as phosphorylated amino acids and peptides.30 CPL probes are also useful for the determination
of the reversible binding and competitive binding of different proteins.31−33 Recently, methods for monitoring the ADP/ATP ratio or sialic acid
via the induced CPL of Eu(III) complexes have been demonstrated.34,35 These results illustrate the utility of thoughtfully designed Eu(III)
probes to signal changes in the local chiral environment.

6 Conclusion
In this mini-review, the recent developments
in lanthanide CPL that evaluate the steric and electronic structures
to construct a luminophore with high CPL activity are described. The
tetramer, dimer, aggregates, and coordination polymer-type Eu(III)
complexes show high CPL activity with a large gCPL and emission quantum yields. The CPL applications based
on the Eu(III) complexes are also described from the viewpoint of
their practical use in devices. Further studies on the luminescent
Eu(III) complexes with high CPL activity can open frontier areas in
the fields of photochemistry and materials science.
