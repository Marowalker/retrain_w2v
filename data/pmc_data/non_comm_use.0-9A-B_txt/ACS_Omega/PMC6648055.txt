Conformational changes
of membrane proteins are accompanied by
deformation in the surrounding lipid bilayer. To gain insight into
the energetics of membrane deformation, the phase behavior of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
(DMPC) membranes in the presence of the dipole potential, ψd, modifiers was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry.
7-Ketocholesterol, which weakens ψd and reduces membrane-perpendicular
dipole–dipole repulsion, causes a discrete second peak on the
high-temperature side of the main transition, whereas 6-ketocholestanol,
which strengthens ψd and increases membrane-perpendicular
dipole–dipole repulsion, merely produces a shoulder. Measurements
on pure DMPC vesicles showed that the observed temperature profile
could not be explained by a single endothermic process, that is, breaking
of van der Waals forces between hydrocarbon chains alone. Removal
of NaCl from the buffer caused an increase in the main transition
temperature and the appearance of an obvious shoulder, implicating
polar interactions. Consideration of the phosphatidylcholine (PC)
head group dipole moment indicates direct interactions between PC
dipoles that are unlikely to account for the additional process. It
seems more likely that the breaking of an in-plane hydrogen-bonded
network consisting of hydrating water dipoles together with zwitterionic
lipid head groups is responsible. The evidence presented supports
the idea that the breaking of van der Waals forces between lipid tails
required for the main phase transition of PC membranes is coupled
to partial breaking of a hydrogen-bonded network at the membrane surface.

Introduction
The phospholipid component
of biological cell membranes contains
multiple dipolar residues within the head group region of the membrane
(e.g., ester carbonyl groups, water dipoles, and phosphocholine),
which could via polar interactions play important roles in determining
membrane stability and in modulating the behavior of membrane proteins.
However, the contributions of polar interactions to membrane function
are, up to now, not well understood.

Let us consider first the
dipolar arrangement perpendicular to
the surface of the membrane. The net effect of the perpendicular components
of all dipolar groups produces an electrical potential difference,
the membrane dipole potential, ψd, which is located
in the narrow region between the glycerol backbone of the phospholipids
and the interface with the neighboring aqueous solution.1−4 The concept of the dipole potential is widely accepted, even though
research on its implications for biological membrane function has
been limited. From first principles, it is logical that the anisotropic
arrangement of any lipid bilayer structure must necessarily require
an alignment of the lipid head groups and that from this alignment
of the associated dipolar groups, an electrical potential should arise.
Because ψd drops over a small distance, it produces
very large field strengths of 108 to 109 V m–1. This is far in excess of field strengths typically
produced by the transmembrane electrical potential, that is, ∼107 V m–1. However, in spite of the large field
strength ψd produces, it appears to have little effect
on the binding and conduction of ions through ion channels or pumps.
The reason for this is that, except for small pore-forming peptides
such as gramicidin, the ions are largely shielded from the high electric
field by the intervening protein mass.5,6

Nevertheless,
significant effects of ψd on the
kinetics of both ion pumps, such as Na+,K+-ATPase,7 and ion channels, such as the voltage-gated hERG
potassium channel,8 have been reported.
The effects of ψd on these proteins appear to occur
via an effect on the kinetics of protein conformational changes, that
is, gating in the case of ion channels. This is consistent with shielding
of the transported ions from the electric field produced by ψd, as described above. The effect of ψd on
membrane protein conformational changes has been postulated9 to be due to local bending of the membrane surface
around membrane proteins, needed to accommodate changes in protein
hydrophobic thickness associated with the proteins’ conformational
changes. Any membrane bending must cause changes in lipid packing
density which produces changes in ψd and in the energy
of dipole–dipole repulsion perpendicular to the membrane surface.

Phospholipid membranes, however, do not only have dipoles arranged
perpendicular to the membrane surface. 31P NMR data and
neutron diffraction studies have shown that the P–N dipole
of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine head group
lies on an average approximately parallel to the membrane surface,10,11 but with small tilts of the dipole relative to the membrane surface
caused by changes in lipid hydration or the binding of ions or dipolar
compounds to the membrane surface.12−15 In addition, both X-ray crystallographic
data16 and infrared spectroscopic data15,17−20 indicate that the phosphate group in particular, but also the nitrogen
of the choline residue, are hydrogen bonded to water dipoles within
the surface, leading to a cooperative hydrogen-bonded network.16,20 Depending on the arrangement of neighboring head groups relative
to one another, the P–N dipoles and the water dipoles could
interact with one another attractively or repulsively. Whichever arrangement
the head groups and their associated water adopt, the overall effect
of dipolar forces on membrane function must be because of the net
result of both membrane-perpendicular and membrane-parallel components
of all lipid-associated and hydrating water dipole moments.

To definitively attribute any change in behavior of a membrane
protein to a membrane-mediated effect arising from the dipolar structure
of the lipid membrane, and to exclude all other possibilities, is
exceedingly difficult. Therefore, rather than study the effect of
membrane dipoles on the deformation of a membrane caused by the conformational
change of a protein, we have chosen to investigate a simpler model
system, where it is known that a significant change in membrane hydrophobic
thickness occurs, that is, the gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition
of PC membranes. As the membrane undergoes the transition from the
gel to the liquid-crystalline phase, the breaking of van der Waals
forces between the hydrocarbon chains converts them from an all-trans
state to a much more fluid and disordered state with a continually
changing mixture of trans and gauche conformations. The disordering
of the hydrocarbon chains increases the cross-sectional area per lipid
and causes a thinning of the membrane.21−25 Thus, the phase transition results in a significant
reduction in hydrophobic thickness. For dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
(DMPC), the decrease in total membrane thickness on passing from the
gel to the liquid crystalline phase has been determined by X-ray diffraction
to be approximately 21%, that is, from 44.5 Å in the gel phase
to 35 Å in the liquid-crystalline phase.21 If dipole–dipole interactions do indeed affect the energetics
of membrane bending, then the gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition
should be dependent on the presence of known dipole potential modifiers.
Not only was this found here to be the case but also the results indicate
that the weakening of in-plane polar attraction in the gel phase is
an important contributor to the energetics of the transition. Thus,
contrary to common belief, the transition is not purely due to the
breaking of the van der Waals forces between the hydrocarbon tails.

Results
Gel-to-Liquid-Crystalline
Phase Transition of Mixed DMPC/Sterol
Membranes
Cholesterol and its derivatives are known to have
significant effects on the magnitude of ψd and have
often been used as tools to modify ψd.26−28 Here, we used cholesterol itself and two derivatives, 6-ketocholestanol
and 7-ketocholesterol (see Figure 1). Cholesterol and 6-ketocholestanol both increase
ψd at sterol mole percentages up to the physiological
level of cholesterol in the plasma membrane of around 40 mol %, but
with the effect of 6-ketocholestanol being significantly greater than
that of cholesterol. In contrast, 7-ketocholesterol causes a decrease
in ψd.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of cholesterol (a), 6-ketocholestanol
(b),
and 7-ketocholesterol (c).

Experimentally it has been found that, on increasing the
level
of either cholesterol, 6-ketocholestanol or 7-ketocholesterol in the
membrane, the maximum heat capacity of the main phase transition [as
measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)] decreases significantly,
until, at sterol levels of ≥∼30 mol %, the transition
disappears completely. The pretransition already disappears even at
lower sterol concentrations. These observations are consistent with
the formation of a liquid-ordered phase, lo, across the
entire temperature range studied (5–65 °C), as reported
previously by other authors for mixtures of DMPC and cholesterol29,30 and the disappearance of the solid-ordered, so, (gel)
and liquid-disordered, ld, (liquid crystalline) phases.

More interesting is the comparison of the effects caused by cholesterol,
6-ketocholestanol, and 7-ketocholesterol (see Figure 2). In the case of 7-ketocholesterol, the
sterol derivative which decreases ψd, a prominent
second peak appears. In the case of cholesterol, which increases ψd, a second peak is also observed, but it is less pronounced
than in the case of 7-ketocholesterol. In the experiments using 6-ketocholestanol,
the derivative which causes the greatest increase in ψd, rather than a clearly defined second peak, only a shoulder is observed,
that is, the second peak is hidden by the more prominent peak on the
low-temperature side of the transition. Thus, the prominence of the
second peak appears to depend inversely on how strongly the sterol
affects ψd. Here, it is important to keep in mind
that the effect of sterols on ψd arises not only
from the component of their dipole moments perpendicular to the membrane
surface but also from their effects on lipid packing and water penetration
into the membrane, which would affect the local dielectric constant.28 It has been well established that sterols have
a significant effect on lipid packing.31−33

mole percentages of either 6-ketocholestanol, cholesterol, or 7-ketocholesterol.
See Tables S1–S3 for transition
temperatures and enthalpy changes.

The different effects of the sterol derivatives on the second
peak
or shoulder are consistent with its attribution to dipole–dipole
interactions (including water dipoles) in the lipid head group region.
Sterols such as cholesterol and 6-ketocholestanol, which increase
ψd, would increase the membrane-perpendicular dipole–dipole
repulsion forces within the head group region, leading to a net decrease
in the overall dipole–dipole head group attraction. In contrast,
7-ketocholesterol, which decreases ψd, would decrease
the membrane-perpendicular dipole–dipole repulsion forces,
allowing membrane in-plane dipole–dipole attraction to become
more prominent, resulting in a net increase in overall dipole–dipole
attraction. This appears to be reflected in the more prominent second
peak observed in the measurements, where 7-ketocholesterol is added
to the membranes.

Another possible interpretation of the second
peak could be the
separation of the membrane into sterol-rich and sterol-poor regions,
with both regions having different strengths of van der Waals interactions
between the lipid tails and, for this reason alone, having different
phase transition temperatures. Indeed, phase separation of multicomponent
membranes including cholesterol has been both theoretically predicted34 and experimentally observed.35 However, if in-plane dipole–dipole attraction were
the cause for the second peak or shoulder in mixed DMPC/sterol membranes,
then in principle, such an interaction should also be present in pure
DMPC membranes. Therefore, we carried out further investigations on
both pure DMPC and pure DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) in order
to determine whether evidence for electrostatic interactions in the
head group region could be found.

Gel-to-Liquid-Crystalline
Phase Transition of Pure DMPC Membranes
If the gel-to-liquid-crystalline
phase transition of a lipid bilayer
were due purely to a single cooperative process, that is, the cooperative
breaking of van der Waals forces between the lipid hydrocarbon chains,
then the heat capacity, Cp, versus temperature, T, profile of the membrane
in the region of the phase transition should be described by a single
symmetrical peak. Mathematically, the dependence of Cp on T for such a system
is given by eq 7 (see
the Experimental Methods).

Experimentally,
however, it was found that it was impossible to fit the DSC curve
of pure DMPC to eq 7.
Instead, an equation describing the sum of three peaks was required
(see Figure 3). Two
of the peaks are relatively sharp (red and blue components in Figure 3), whereas the third
(green) is very broad. To test whether any of the peaks could be due
to components in the buffer solution interacting with the membrane,
DSC scans were also performed for DMPC vesicles in solutions from
which components of the buffer mixture were removed. In all cases,
three peaks were necessary to adequately fit the data. Thus, the three
peaks are not due to interaction of any buffer components with the
membrane; they are an intrinsic property of the DMPC/water system,
although modulated by the solution composition.

Figure 3 DSC profiles of DMPC
in buffer containing 30 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
and 1 mM EDTA adjusted to pH 7.2 using HCl (top), in the same buffer
but excluding NaCl (middle) and in water (bottom). The solid lines
are the experimental data. The dotted curves are the deconvoluted
components, obtained via fitting to a sum of 3 functions described
by eq 7. Values of the
fit parameters obtained are given in Table S4 of the Supporting Information. Averaging the total areas under the
thermograms obtained in each of the three suspension media yields
an average ΔH of 26 (±3) kJ mol–1, which is consistent with previous measurements.39

It was noticed that the main phase
transition temperature shifted
from 23.5 °C in buffer containing 30 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and
1 mM EDTA at pH 7.2 to 24.1 °C in pure water. From experiments
in which NaCl was totally removed from the buffer, it could be shown
that this shift is predominantly due to removal of salt from the solution.
This can be explained by NaCl screening of polar interactions within
the head group region of the membrane, which does not occur when the
DMPC vesicles are prepared in pure water. At the NaCl concentration
used, 150 mM, specific binding of either Na+ or Cl– to the membrane surface appears to be very unlikely.
Pabst et al.36 have estimated that saturation
of a PC membrane surface with Na+ ions only occurs at salt
concentrations >6.7 M. Chloride ions have been reported to bind
to
PC membranes only with a marginally higher affinity than Na+.37

Another significant observation
was that, after removal of NaCl
from the buffer, an obvious shoulder appeared on the high-temperature
side of the main transition peak (see Figure 3). Both shifts in the transition temperature
and the change in the shape of the main transition on NaCl removal
are consistent with polar interactions between lipid head groups and
their associated water molecules playing a significant role in determining
the phase transition energetics. It is important to note that shifts
of the phase transition temperature to lower values would be expected38 if a solute in the solution preferentially dissolved
or interacted with lipid molecules in the liquid-crystalline phase
and hence stabilized this state relative to the gel state (i.e., analogous
to freezing point depression of ideal solutions). However, this analogy
is strictly valid only if the membrane could be considered as an isotropic
solvent and this is definitely not true. As described in the Introduction, a membrane is anisotropic, with polar
and nonpolar regions to which solutes can bind with different affinities.
Furthermore, the ideal solution analogy does not explain either the
shoulder evident on NaCl removal or the three functions necessary
to describe the experimental curve obtained in pure water.

The
results described above show that the gel-to-liquid-crystalline
phase transition of DMPC is not simply due to the breaking of van
der Waals forces between the lipid hydrocarbon chains. Other endothermic
processes must also be involved. If the transition is not alone due
to the hydrocarbon chains, the only other possible contribution would
seem to be from the polar head group region, that is, dipole–dipole
attractive forces in the head group region must also be overcome.

The alignment of dipoles perpendicular to the membrane surface,
which gives rise to ψd must produce a repulsive interaction
between neighboring lipid molecules. Therefore, this cannot account
for the additional functions required to describe the DSC curve observed
for pure DMPC. Thus, it would seem that the extra endothermic processes
can only arise from dipolar components parallel to the membrane surface,
such as the PC head group and associated water molecules. To test
this conclusion further, we studied the phase behavior of DPPC membranes
under the same experimental conditions as those used for DMPC. With
its longer hydrocarbon tails, that is, 16 carbon atoms instead of
14 for DMPC, DPPC has stronger van der Waals forces between the hydrocarbon
tails than DMPC. Because the head groups of DMPC and DPPC are identical,
one would expect, however, no significant difference in polar forces
within the head group region between the two lipids. Thus, the relative
strength of van der Waals forces between the lipid tails to any polar
forces within the head groups would increase on going from DMPC to
DPPC.

Gel-to-Liquid-Crystalline Phase transition of Pure DPPC Membranes
Significant differences were observed between the DSC profiles
of DPPC (see Figure 4) and those of DMPC (see Figure 2). First, as has been reported often before,40−44 the main phase transition of DPPC occurs at a temperature of 41.4
°C, approximately 18° higher than that of DMPC. This is
clearly due to the longer hydrocarbon tails of DPPC and hence stronger
attractive van der Waals forces between the tails. The phase transition
of DPPC is also sharper, that is, more cooperative, than that of DMPC.
This is also to be expected, because more van der Waals attractions
need to be cooperatively broken in DPPC than in DMPC in order to convert
the membrane from the gel to the liquid-crystalline state.

Figure 4 DSC profiles
of DPPC in buffer containing 30 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
and 1 mM EDTA adjusted to pH 7.2 using HCl (top), in the same buffer
but excluding NaCl (middle) and in water (bottom). The solid lines
are the experimental data. The dotted curves are the deconvoluted
components, obtained via fitting to a sum of two functions described
by eq 7. Values of the
fit parameters obtained are given in Table S5 of the Supporting Information. Averaging the total areas under the
thermograms obtained in each of the three suspension media yields
an average ΔH of 29 (±4) kJ mol–1, which is consistent with previous measurements.39

A similarity between the DPPC
and DMPC curves is that more than
one mathematical peak function was required to describe the observed
data. This is particularly the case for DPPC in pure water, which
displays a DSC thermogram which is significantly broader than that
observed for DPPC in buffer. The fact that the DSC profile is much
sharper in buffer than in water suggests that attractive polar interactions
in the head group region are effectively screened in buffer solution.
In contrast to DMPC, however, DPPC shows very little difference in
the DSC behavior observed in buffers with and without NaCl. Also in
contrast to DMPC, in DPPC there is no observable difference in the
phase transition temperature in the three different solutions, that
is, the phase transition occurs at 41.4 °C in each case. Thus,
it appears that the polar interactions between the PC head groups
play a much smaller role in the energetics of the phase transition
of DPPC compared to DMPC and that in DPPC, they are largely screened
even before the addition of NaCl to the buffer. The observed results
are, thus, consistent with strengthened van der Waals forces relative
to polar forces on going from DMPC to DPPC, as predicted in the previous
section.

Discussion
The DSC results described
here on pure DMPC and DPPC with and without
NaCl in the buffer and on DMPC membranes to which sterols have been
added indicate that additional endothermic processes are involved
in the lipid’s main phase transition apart from the breaking
of van der Waals forces between the lipid hydrocarbon tails. The fact
that the energetics of the transition of DMPC are dependent on the
presence or absence of salt in the surrounding buffer and that the
salt effects are reduced in DPPC with stronger van der Waals forces
between the lipid tails implicates a role of polar interactions in
the transition. It is worthwhile noting that additional peaks or shoulders
have previously been observed in DSC scans of shorter chain PCs (12
and 13 carbon atoms), but the physical basis for them was not determined.42,45

From integration of the area under the DSC curves, the total
enthalpy
change per mole of lipid for the breaking of both van der Waals interactions
between the hydrocarbon chains and polar interactions between the
lipid head groups and their associated water molecules can be experimentally
obtained. It is interesting to see if the enthalpy change obtained
for the shoulder of the DMPC transition is consistent with what one
would expect from a theoretical point of view for a dipole–dipole
lipid head group interaction.

If the dipoles of the lipid head
groups are aligned approximately
in a colinear fashion, as experimental data indicate,10,11 the interaction of a pair of neighboring head groups would be attractive.
Assuming the distance of separation of two dipoles is much greater
than the distance between the two poles of the dipole, the energy, E, of interaction of two colinear dipoles in isolation is
given by46 1  where
μ is the dipole moment, r is the distance between
the two dipoles, ε0 is the permittivity of free space,
and ε is the dielectric
constant of the medium. In a two-dimensional array of dipoles, as
present in a membrane surface, the magnitude of the attractive energy
would be modulated by a factor M because of interactions
with all neighboring dipoles as well as those more distant, where M is the Madelung constant determined by the geometric packing
of the dipoles.

The dipole moment of the PC head group has been
estimated from
dielectric dispersion measurements to have a value of 19 D or 6.4
× 10–29 C m.47 In
the gel phase, the area occupied per lipid in the plane of the membrane
has been determined to be 49 Å2,48 so that the maximum possible separation between two neighboring
head group dipoles is 7 Å. Using these values for μ and r in eq 1 and
assuming a dielectric constant close to water of 80 yields a lower
limit of the energy of interaction between two isolated lipid head
group dipoles of 1.6 kJ mol–1. However, theoretical
calculations have indicated that the dielectric constant at the position
of the PC head group could in fact be much greater than that of pure
water, and a value of 210 has been estimated.49 Based on this value, the energy of interaction of two isolated head
group dipoles would only be expected to be 0.015 kJ mol–1.

To estimate a molar energy of interaction for the extended
lattice
of the membrane and take into account both nearest and non-nearest
neighbor interactions, the value of 0.015 kJ mol–1 would need to be multiplied by the appropriate value of M for the lattice. Typically, Madelung constants are in
the range 1–4,50 but even taking
an extreme value of 10, only results in an interaction energy of around
0.15 kJ mol–1. Comparing this value to the experimentally
determined total enthalpy change for a gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase
transition of DMPC of 23–29 kJ mol–1, it
indicates that, from a theoretical point of view, dipole–dipole
interactions between PC dipoles of the head group in the plane of
the membrane would not be expected to make a major contribution to
the overall energetics of the transition.

However, as described
in the Introduction, the PC head groups are
thought to be hydrogen bonded to hydrating
water molecules, forming a hydrogen-bonded water network across the
membrane surface.16,20 Therefore, rather than the additional
peak in the DSC profile of DMPC being associated with disruption of
dipole–dipole forces between PC dipoles, it seems more likely
that it is due to disruption of the hydrogen-bonded water network.
This would be consistent with the infrared spectroscopic measurements
of Arrondo et al.,17 showing that the gel-to-liquid-crystalline
phase transition causes no change in the wavenumbers of phosphate
vibrations in the range of 1000–1300 cm–1. For a comparison of the energy change expected on partial disruption
of a hydrogen-bonded water network, one could consider the enthalpy
change associated with the melting of ice into liquid water, that
is, the enthalpy of H2O fusion, which has a value of 6.00
kJ mol–1.51 This value
is approximately one-quarter of the total enthalpy change associated
with the main phase transition of DMPC. Of course, the enthalpy of
H2O fusion is given per mole of water molecules, whereas
the enthalpy change associated with the main phase transition of DMPC
is given per mole of lipid molecules. However, the number of water
molecules per lipid molecule is not expected to be large. X-ray crystal
structural analysis shows two waters per lipid.16 Thus, it seems likely that the additional process associated
with the gel-to-liquid-crystalline transition of DMPC which is responsible
for the shoulder or extra peak on the high-temperature side of the
transition is due to the disruption of the hydrogen-bonded water network
at the membrane surface.

Because DSC is not a structural technique,
it is worth considering
recent spectroscopic data which are consistent with the interpretation
presented here. The orientation and dynamics of water interacting
with surfaces, such as biological membranes, can now be investigated
by techniques of vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy.52−55 Using heterodyne-detected VSFG spectroscopy, Mondal et al.53 distinguished three distinct water structures
at a PC/water interface: (1) water associated with the negatively
charged phosphate (WP), with the positive hydrogen end
of the water dipole pointing toward the phosphate; (2) water associated
with the positively charged choline (WC), with the negative
oxygen end of the water dipole pointing toward the nitrogen atom of
the choline; and (3) water interacting with the lipid at the level
of its glycerol backbone (WH), with the positive hydrogen
end of the water dipole pointing toward the ester linkage to the hydrocarbon
chains. Because of their location, in a region of lower dielectric
constant, and their orientation, it would seem likely that the WH water molecules could be a major contributor to the inside-positive
ψd. This would be consistent with previous reports
suggesting a major contribution from water in this location to the
sign and magnitude of ψd.56−59 The results of Gawrisch et al.57 and those of Starke-Peterkovic and Clarke59 in particular indicate that water most likely
interacts with the carbonyl group of the sn-2 hydrocarbon chain.

The WP and WC waters, on the other hand,
are more likely to be involved in a hydrogen-bonded water network,
which we propose here is disrupted by the main phase transition of
the lipid. Via time-resolved heterodyne-detected VSFG measurements,
Inoue et al.20 showed that the dynamics
of hydrogen bond fluctuation of the WP waters is influenced
by that of the WC waters. Thus, there exists cooperativity
in hydrogen bonding extending across the membrane surface. It is important
to note that all of the structural information about the zwitterionic
PC/water surface gained via VSFG spectroscopy has been obtained via
studies on lipid monolayers spread on a water/air interface. The results
obtained here using DSC on lipid vesicles not only provide thermodynamic
information on the strength of attractive polar interactions at the
DMPC membrane surface but they also provide evidence that the structural
and dynamic information obtained by VSFG spectroscopy hold true for
the more biologically relevant lipid bilayer system. On the basis
of the thermodynamic data obtained here via DSC, the structural information
from VSFG, and spectroscopic data on the dipole potential, it is possible
to construct the schematic diagram of the hydration of PC/water interface
shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Schematic
diagram of the surface of a PC membrane. H2O molecules
hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl group of the sn-2 hydrocarbon
chain are thought to be a major contributor to the inside-positive
dipole potential, ψd, which causes a membrane-perpendicular
polar repulsion between neighboring lipid molecules. H2O dipoles on the membrane surface are shown in alternating hydrogens-up
(H-bonded to the positive choline residue) and hydrogens-down (H-bonded
to the negative phosphate group) orientations, which via H bonding
with each other form an attractive in-plane H-bonded H2O network across the surface. In the expanded lipid molecule, partial
charges on the H2O molecules and the sn-2 chains carbonyl
group are shown, in addition to full charges on the choline and phosphate
groups. The carbonyl group of the sn-2 chain is thought to be oriented
at an angle, with its oxygen pointing toward the membrane surface,
thus orienting H2O molecules with their hydrogens pointing
toward the membrane interior.57,59

Conclusions
Finally, returning to the initial motivation
for this study, in
the light of the new results presented here, it is important to consider
whether local deformations in head group packing of lipids caused
by conformational changes of membrane proteins which alter the local
membrane hydrophobic thickness could make a significant contribution
to the relative thermodynamic stability of different protein conformational
states, as previously proposed.9 The DSC
results have shown that enthalpy changes associated with changes in
head group hydration become more dominant relative to van der Waals
interactions between the lipid hydrocarbon tails when the hydrocarbon
tails become shorter or when their interaction is weakened by the
introduction of cholesterol or another sterol. In the biological membranes
of animals, van der Waals interactions between the lipid hydrocarbon
tails are expected to be much weaker than, for example, in DPPC, not
only because of the presence of cholesterol (up to 40 mol %) but also
because of the presence of lipids with hydrocarbon chains with significant
degrees of cis-unsaturation, which drastically perturbs chain packing.
Under these circumstances, one would, therefore, expect the contribution
of lipid head group hydration to the thermodynamics of membrane structural
changes to be even more important than that observed here for the
phase transition of DMPC. Previously, however, only the repulsive
membrane-perpendicular component to the energetics of membrane bending
arising from the dipole potential was considered.9 The DSC results presented here indicate that an attractive
in-plane interaction in the head group region would also be involved.
Thus, the energy cost in local outward bending of a membrane to accommodate
an increase in hydrophobic thickness of a membrane protein arising
from an increase in the local dipole potential (and an increase in
lipid packing density) is likely to be reduced by an energetically
favorable increase in the in-plane polar attraction.

Experimental
Methods
Materials
Origins of the reagents used were as follows:
DMPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA), ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA, ≥99%, Sigma, Castle Hill, Australia), tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane
(Tris, 99%, Alfa Aesar, Heysham, UK), sodium chloride (analytical
grade, Merck, Kilsyth, Australia), HCl (0.1 N Titrisol solution, Merck),
and chloroform (≥99.0%, Uvasol, Merck). Purified water (18.2
MΩ) was obtained via a Millipore Direct-Q 5UV-R system (Merck
Millipore, Bayswater, Australia).

Vesicle Preparation
Separate stock solutions of DMPC
and of each sterol used were first prepared at a concentration of
3 mM in chloroform. All solutions were prepared by weight, using a
chloroform density of 1.48 g mL–1. A 5 mL sample
of the DMPC stock was then mixed with the appropriate volume of the
sterol stock to obtain the desired mole percentages in the vesicles
subsequently formed (e.g., for a preparation of 20 mol % sterol, 5
mL of DMPC and 1.25 mL of sterol stock were mixed). The chloroform
was then removed from each sample via rotary evaporation under vacuum
for 30–40 min at maximum rotation speed using R-114 Rotavapor
(Büchi, Flawil, Switzerland) to form a thin lipid film on the
walls of a round-bottom flask. The vacuum was maintained initially
at 474 mbar using a V-850 vacuum controller (Büchi). After
no visible traces of chloroform could be detected in the flask, the
resulting film was dried for a further 30 min at 10 mbar. Throughout
rotary evaporation, the thermal bath was kept at a temperature of
approximately 40 °C. Multilamellar vesicles were then formed
by resuspending the lipid film in 5 mL of either water or buffer containing
30 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA (adjusted to pH 7.2 using HCl).
Via this procedure, the molar concentration of DMPC in the DSC cell
is always 3 mM for every scan, regardless of the mole percentage of
sterol. Furthermore, because the sterols are present with the phospholipid
in chloroform solution before rotary evaporation and resuspension
in aqueous solution, it can be assumed that the sterols are distributed
through all leaflets of the multilamellar vesicles formed.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry
DSC measurements
were performed using a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northampton,
MA). Prior to analysis of a sample, seven scans were collected and
averaged. The baseline, obtained using the appropriate suspension
medium, that is, buffer or water, in both the sample and reference
cells of the instrument, was then subtracted from the sample scan.
To avoid scan rate-dependent shifts in the observed phase transitions,
low-temperature scan rates of either 10 or 5 °C h–1 were used for all measurements. The lower scan rate of 5 °C
h–1 was used for measurements of DPPC in buffer
with and without NaCl, because in these cases, the main phase transitions
occur over a particularly small temperature range. This allowed the
collection of more data points, thus assisting in deconvolution of
the measured DSC curves.

Data Fitting
If the gel-to-liquid-crystalline
phase
transition of a lipid bilayer were due purely to a single cooperative
process, that is, the cooperative breaking of van der Waals forces
between the lipid hydrocarbon chains, then the heat capacity, Cp, versus temperature, T, profile of the membrane in the region of the phase transition
(as measured by DSC) should be described by a single symmetrical peak.
Mathematically, the dependence of Cp on T for such a system is given by eq 2 2  where R is the universal
gas constant, N0 is the size of the cooperative
unit (i.e., the number of lipid molecules cooperatively undergoing
the transition), Tm is the phase transition
temperature (i.e., the midpoint temperature of the transition), and
ΔH is the enthalpy change per mole of lipid
for the entire transition. ΔH is given by the
integral of Cp with respect
to T.

The derivation of eq 2 is based on the following three basic equations 3   4   5  where x is the degree of
the transition, that is, in our case considering just the gel-to-liquid-crystalline
phase transition x = 0 in the gel phase at temperatures
far below Tm and x =
1 in the liquid-crystalline phase at temperatures far above Tm. Equation 3 is simply the mathematical definition of heat capacity
at constant pressure, that is, the differential of the heat transferred
with respect to temperature. Equation 4 is derived from the van’t Hoff equation for
the dependence of the equilibrium constant of a reaction on temperature. Equation 5 is derived from
the relationship between K and the standard Gibbs
free energy change, ΔG0, which,
by definition must be zero at T = Tm (where K = 1), that is K = exp(−ΔG0/RT). Expanding ΔG0 into entropy and
enthalpy components, the entropy component can be eliminated by expressing
it in the form ΔS0 = ΔH0/Tm, where ΔH0 is the van’t Hoff enthalpy change for
the transition (=N0ΔH).

Nonlinear regression fitting of experimental data was carried
out
using the commercially available program Prism 7.02 (GraphPad Software
Inc., La Jolla, CA). Rather than fitting the experimental data directly
to a sum of functions described by eq 2, the size of the cooperative unit, N0, was substituted by 6  where Cpmax is the maximum
value of the heat capacity at the phase transition temperature, Tm. This yields the following fit function instead 7  

Although eqs 2 and 7 are mathematically identical, fitting to eq 7 has the advantage that
an initial estimate of Cpmax can more easily be
made from the experimental data than in the case of N0. This improves the efficiency of the nonlinear fitting
procedure. The fitting parameters were, thus, Tm, Cpmax, and ΔH. Because ΔH is the integral of the heat capacity
across an entire phase transition, for the purposes of fitting, initial
estimates of ΔH for each component peak of
a DSC curve were set to the total area under the curve.
