The fast, accurate,
and ultrasensitive detection of toxic mercury
in real water samples is still challenging without the use of expensive
sophisticated instruments. Herein, highly fluorescent gold nanoclusters
(AuNCs) were synthesized using a newer protein templet, esterase (EST).
The EST-AuNCs consisted of ∼25 Au atoms in the nanocluster
having ∼2 nm size. EST-AuNCs were found to be highly stable
in aqueous buffer with a wide range of pH (pH 4–12) and were
also stable in powdered form. The fluorescence quantum yield of EST-AuNCs
in deionized water was 6.2% which had increased to 7.8% upon the addition
of 1 M NaCl (an increase of 23%). The EST-AuNCs selectively sense
the toxic Hg2+ ions with higher sensitivity (limit of detection;
0.88 nM) with the linear range 1–30 nM. The test strips for
rapid sensing of Hg2+ in real water samples were developed
on the polymeric surface. The validation of sensing ability of EST-AuNCs
suggested 94–98% recovery with linearity. Moreover, because
of the widely reported applications of EST, the developed EST-AuNCs
could also be used for another sensing, catalytic, and biomedical
applications.

Introduction
Nanoclusters (NCs)
have many remarkable characters compared with
their larger one because of ultrasmall size (<2 nm) in sub-nanometer
dimensions. The 3D arrangement of their free electrons gives rise
to size-dependent electronic, optical, and chemical properties.1−5 Among all metal NCs, gold nanocluster is the most important one
because of their light emission range suitable for effective tissue
penetration, biocompatibility, large Stokes shift, stability, ligand-dependent
fluorescence properties. They also have a wide range of catalytic
and biomedical applications.6 Various methods
such as chemical reduction, template-assisted synthesis, etching,
photoreduction, and so forth to synthesize fluorescent gold NCs (AuNCs)
have been widely reported.7,8 Among these procedures,
a biosynthetic route is more advantageous in terms of easiness, environment
friendliness, and speediness with good quantum yield.8,9 Recently, we have reported fluorescence gold nanoparticles using
a plant extract having very low fluorescence quantum yield.10 Protein-directed synthesis of AuNCs is a single
pot green synthetic route for the production of highly stable and
highly fluorescent AuNCs. First, Xie et al. synthesized the highly
fluorescent AuNCs using commercially available bovine serum albumin
(BSA)5 and subsequently used them to sense
mercury (Hg2+) with 0.5 nM limit of detection (LOD).11 Strong fluorescent property of metal NCs is
one of the most important research areas in biosensing and bioimaging
field. Quenching of fluorescence is the main mechanism behind the
sensing of the trace amount of substances (i.e., various heavy metals,
enzymes, etc.).9,12,13

Hg2+ is a toxic heavy metal ion when binding to
different
cellular components leads to serious complications and death. Because
of its higher toxicity in nanomolar concentration, there is a need
for highly sensitive and selective sensing system to determine Hg2+ at very low concentration.8 Au+ can selectively sense Hg2+ ion by the interaction
between the electrons present in “d” orbitals, hence,
many systems containing Au+ ions have been reported as
a sensing system for Hg2+. Chen et al. summarized most
of them with LOD’s 0.5–5 nM.8 There is a major concern to prepare highly fluorescent AuNCs by
a biological route having more selectivity and less LOD to sense the
Hg2+ more precisely. Esterase (EST) is a class of enzymes
extensively distributed in mammalian tissue. The enzyme is mainly
responsible for the metabolism of xenobiotic; it catalyzes the hydrolysis
of ester and amide containing compounds.14,15 Most of the ESTs contains a large number of amino acids (550) and
have around 14 tyrosine, 10 tryptophan, 4 cysteines, 19 aspartates,
35 glutamate, and 16 methionine residues in its peptide chain.14,16 Tyrosine, tryptophan, and sulfur-containing amino acids are mainly
responsible for the reduction of Au(III) ion in alkaline pH and the
formation of gold nanocluster.5,7 Herein, we established
a simple one-step EST-mediated synthesis of highly fluorescent AuNCs
(EST-AuNCs), which can specifically and ultrasensitively detect Hg2+ (LOD = 0.88 nM). The comparative properties of EST-AuNCs
such as linear range and LOD with respect to the other similar
sensors are furnished in the Table 1. A newer protein templet (EST) was initially
used to synthesize the gold NCs. Before the final synthesis, the conditions
for the synthesis of NCs were extensively optimized. The synthesized
NCs were characterized using various techniques. The stability of
EST-AuNCs in the various environmental conditions such as pHs, presence
of organic chemicals, and salt concentrations was determined. Further,
the test strips were developed to sense the Hg2+ in real
water samples. The sensing ability, selectivity, sensitivity, and
mechanism of sensing were characterized using various techniques.
Overall, highly fluorescent AuNCs were synthesized, characterized,
and further developed as an ultrasensitive sensor of Hg2+.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of EST-AuNCs
Highly fluorescent
AuNCs were
synthesized using EST as a template for the reduction and stabilization
of gold atoms in sub-nanometer sized clusters. The blank EST protein
solution showed pale yellow color in visible light and emitted weak
green fluorescence under UV at 365 nm because of the presence of aromatic
amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan, etc.). After 18 h of reaction at
35 °C, the slight color change was observed in the reaction mixture
in visible light. Interestingly, the solution showed intense luminescence
under UV (365 nm), because of ultrasmall NCs (<3 nm) having unique
luminescence properties,8,25 indicating the formation
of AuNCs (Figure 1a).
The fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of EST-AuNCs
were found to be 480 and 650 nm, respectively (Figure 1b,c). The fluorescence quantum yield of EST-AuNCs
(Q, ∼6.2%) in deionized water was calculated
using relative quantum yield method26 where
rhodamine 6G was used as a standard (Q, 95%) (see Section S2). Further, the absence of plasmonic
band (at 520 nm) in UV–vis spectra (Figure 1d) demonstrated the absence of larger nanoparticles
in the solution which was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis.
The DLS spectrum and TEM analysis showed that the average NCs diameter
was <2 nm (Figure 1e,f). The MALDI TOF/TOF MS analysis of EST-AuNCs and free EST showed
molecular ion peaks at 173 and 168 kDa, respectively, which represented
attribution of ∼25 gold atoms in the cluster (shift in molecular
weight ∼5 kDa, Figure S3). The higher
stability of 25-atom magic cluster has been most commonly reported.5,7,27−29 The presence
of the gold in the synthesized NCs has been further confirmed by line
energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping studies (Figure S4). The differential scanning colorimetric
analysis showed stabilization of inorganic gold in the organic enzyme
matrix (Figure S5). The attenuated total
reflection (ATR) spectroscopy analysis showed no difference in the
individual spectrum of EST and EST-AuNCs, suggesting the presence
of similar functional groups. The study reveals that no covalent interaction
was found between gold and EST in the EST-AuNCs (Figure S6).

Similar to the BSA stabilized AuNCs reported by Xie et al.,5 the Au0 core of NCs got stabilized
by a small amount of Au+ in EST-AuNCs. The 4f7/2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of EST-AuNCs showed
the deviation in binding energy from the Au(0) [84.0 eV], confirming
the stabilization of Au(0) by the surrounded Au(+) in the NCs (Figure 2). The photoluminescence
emission of EST-AuNCs at 650 nm corroborates the spherical Jellium
model in the presence of 25 gold atoms in the spherical NCs.30,31 It has been reported that the pH of the medium above the pKa values of reducing amino acids (tyrosine and
tryptophan) is responsible for the reduction of the Au3+ ion to Au0 or Au+.8 The AuNCs could have been stabilized within protein environment
because of one or combinatory effect of the following: (1) the bonding
of Au atom with the S atom present in the cysteine amino acid of EST,
(2) other amino acids (histidine) can also coordinate with the Au
atoms, and (3) the large structure of the protein might have been
responsible for the sterical protection of AuNCs.8,32

The luminescence properties of EST-AuNCs were checked in
buffers
of various different pHs with increasing salt concentration. No apparent
change in photoluminescence was observed with a wide range of pHs
(3.5–12) and phosphate buffer saline (10–100 mM, pH
7.4). Notably, the fluorescence intensity reduced slowly with the
increase in pH more than 12, whereas an irreversible sudden decrease
in the fluorescence was observed below pH 2.7. The study suggested
that the fluorescence can be reversed by increasing its pH up to 11
for the EST-AuNCs solution and that pH had decreased up to 2.7. The
fluorescence of the EST-AuNCs solution could not be reversed which
has the pH below 2.7 (Figure S7). The initial
decrease in fluorescence was due to the structural changes in the
protein structures at lower pH, confirmed by circular dichroism (CD)
spectra (Figures 3a,b,
and S8). Moreover, dropping in the pH endorsed
the zeta potential toward “zero”, which tends to the
aggregation of NCs and responsible for the fluorescence quenching
(Figure 3c). The initial
decrease in fluorescence can be reversed upon increase in pH because
the secondary structure can be restored to its initial stable state.
Further decrease in the pH resulted the irreversible change in the
secondary structure of the enzyme template, as well as complete aggregation
of NCs endorsed the sudden decrease in the fluorescence. Here, the
increased size of the NCs owes the main reason behind the fluorescence
quenching as the photophysical properties of larger particles have
different characteristics than small (<2 nm) NCs. The addition
of salt in the solution of EST-AuNCs showed gradual increment in the
fluorescence with respect to increase in the salt concentration (Figures 3d and S9). The fluorescence intensity of EST-AuNCs
was increased by ∼23% at a higher salt concentration (1 M,
NaCl). The higher salt concentration might have the favorable condition
to stabilize the EST-AuNCs because of the structural stability of
protein (Figure 3e).
Moreover, increased ionic strength might have been responsible for
the increased radiative decay of electrons through restriction of
nonradiative electrons decay from the excited state to the ground
state. However, the exact mechanism of this increased radiative decay
needs more extensive study. The fluorescence quantum yield (Q) of EST-AuNCs in 1 M NaCl solution was found to be ∼7.8%.
The stability of the EST-AuNCs in various other solvents (toluene,
dimethyl sulfoxide, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,
diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, and chloroform) was determined.
The significant fluorescence quenching was observed with precipitation
in all the solvents tested (Figure S10).
This study suggested the instability of the EST-AuNCs in the tested
solvents. The instability of the EST protein in these solvents might
be the most plausible reason of loss of the fluorescence.

Sensing of Hg2+
The complete fluorescence
quenching of EST-AuNCs (20 μM in aqueous solution) was observed
within seconds upon the addition of 30 μM Hg2+ (Figure 4a,b). Many of the
studies for Hg2+ sensing based on the AuNC fluorescence
quenching showed diverse mechanistic aspects such as aggregation induced33,34 and AuNCs complex formation.35,36 Most recently, Senthamizhan
et al. proposed the possible reason for highly selective AuNC fluorescence
quenching, it might be the Au–Hg amalgam formation due to the
enhanced interaction between Hg2+ and gold.37 These results also corroborate the findings
reported by Xie et al. who suggested the interactions of Hg2+ with Au+ might be responsible for the selective fluorescence
quenching of AuNCs.11 Here, we speculated
that Au+ present on the surface of AuNCs could interact
selectively to the Hg2+ and form Au–Hg amalgam.
The Au–Hg interaction was confirmed by line EDS element mapping
of the EST-AuNCs–Hg amalgam. The results showed that Hg was
present with Au in the bonded state (Figure 4d). Here, mercury is uniformly located at
the site of AuNCs confirming the strong interaction between mercury
and gold. The XPS analysis of Hg-treated EST-AuNCs supported the formation
of Au–Hg amalgam as the Hg 4f region has well separated (Δ
= 4.0 eV), while no significant difference in other components (Au
4f and C 1s) of EST-AuNCs was observed in the XPS spectra (Figure 5a–d). The
quenching effect was resulted because of the formation of d10–d10 bonds because of the interaction between Au+ (4f145d10) and Hg2+ (4f145d10).17 Further, the
size of Hg2+ treated EST-AuNCs was also ∼2 nm, which
confirmed that very few Hg2+ ions are needed for fluorescence
quenching (Figure 4c). Moreover, the fluorescence lifetime decay studies with different
concentrations of Hg2+ (0, 5, 10, 30, and 50 nM) showed
0.22, 0.26, 0.22, 0.22, and 0.26 ns lifetime decay, respectively (Figure 5e). The study showed
no significant change in the lifetime decay with respect to the blank
revealed that, the quenching had resulted because of the static quenching
or ground-state phenomenon.38 The substantial
fluorescence quenching by Co2+ maybe because of the interaction
between the enzyme and Co2+ ions. The same concentration
of Hg2+ was having significant quenching efficiency (complete
quenching) than Co2+. These results confirmed the sensitivity
of AuNCs toward selective Hg2+ sensing.

line EDS mapping was performed for the resulted reaction mixture.

excitation and emission wavelengths for this study were 508 and 640
nm, respectively.

In a typical experiment,
various relevant metal ion salts (30 μM)
were added to 20 μM aqueous solution of EST-AuNCs, and the fluorescence
properties of the solution were analyzed. Despite the 100% fluorescence
quenching upon the addition of Hg2+, no substantial change
in the fluorescence intensity was observed with the various environmentally
relevant metal ions, namely, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Se4+, Cu2+, Al3+, Sn2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, and Co2+ (Figure 4a). The method is suitable
to analyze the samples from different environmental sources because
of the compatibility of EST-AuNCs in different buffers and pH. The
interaction ability of Hg2+ with the Au+ determines
the sensitivity of the AuNCs. The stronger interaction led to higher
sensitivity, whereas weaker interaction indicates low sensitivity.11,39 Further, after the confirmation of selectivity by Hg2+ ions, it was important to determine the linearity and LOD. For this
purpose, the lowest concentration of AuNCs (25 nM) was used. The higher
concentration of AuNCs did not show the significant difference in
the fluorescence upon addition of very low concentration of Hg2+. Thus, low concentrated EST-AuNCs solution (25 nM) was used
for further study and determination of LOD and linearity. The effect
of very small amount of Hg2+ could be easily tracked upon
the fluorescence of 25 nM AuNCs solution using fluorescence spectrophotometer.
After the addition of different concentrations (0.025–100 nm)
of Hg2+ into the aqueous solutions of EST-AuNCs (25 nM),
separately, the resulted solution showed the decrease in fluorescence
intensities with the increase in Hg2+ concentration (Figures 6a and S11). More than 70 and 80% fluorescence quenching
was observed upon the addition of 30 and 75 nM Hg2+, respectively
(Figure 6b). In the
present curve, the inconsistent and nonlinear fall in fluorescence
was observed with the addition of 0–1 nM Hg2+, thus
there was no quantitative relation between EST-AuNCs and Hg2+ upon initial addition of Hg2+. The linear decrease (R2 = 0.99) was observed at 1–30 nM Hg2+ which could be useful in the quantitative determination
of Hg2+ (Figure 6b inset). This linear quenching corroborates the phenomena
of static quenching. Thus, the static quenching effect might be responsible
for the linear fluorescence quenching.40 The fluorescence intensity decreased linearly with the addition
of 1–30 nM of Hg2+ (Figure 6b inset). Moreover, the estimated LOD to
sense the Hg2+ was 0.88 nM, (1.76 ppb) at a signal to noise
ratio >3, was lower than the permitted level of Hg2+ in
the drinking water (2 ppb) as reported by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency. The current method is highly sensitive and corroborated
the methods reported in the literature using various fluorescent NCs
(Table 1).

(b) Decrease in relative fluorescence intensity upon addition of increased

in relative fluorescence in the range of 1–30 nM Hg2+ concentration. The detailed LOD calculation has been furnished in
the Section S4.

Further, experiments were extended toward the development
of paper
test strip. Similar to the BSA stabilized AuNCs,11,41 the EST-AuNCs were found to be stable at the polymeric support.
For this purpose, the small pieces of Whatman paper no. 41 was soaked
in EST-AuNCs solution (20 μM) for 24 h, rinsed with deionized
water, and air-dried. The persistent fluorescence properties suggested
that the developed strips could be stable for more than 6 months at
4 °C in an airtight container. The test strips were dipped into
the 30 μM solution of different metal ions and various other
compounds such as urea, uric acid, hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid,
and sodium sulphate. After 2 min, the strips were put out, air–dried,
and observed under UV. All the strips showed fluorescence except the
strip which was dipped into the solution of Hg2+ (Figure 4b, panel 3). Apart
from other metal ions and other tested compounds (Figure S12), Hg2+ ions were selectively interacted
with the Au+ and were responsible for fluorescence quenching.
Thus, these strips could be useful for the quick visual detection
of Hg2+ in the samples. Moreover, the recorded confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images at various concentrations
of Hg2+ showed the complete fluorescence quenching with
100 nM Hg2+ (Figure 7a). The CLSM images of a single strand of a test strip showed
the complete fluorescence quenching within 35 min when treated with
100 nM Hg2+ (Figure 7b). The CLSM results suggested the application of the developed
AuNCs in the real-time sensing of Hg2+.

test strips and determination of
sensing performance using CLSM. CLSM images of test strips showing,
(a) sensing performance with increasing concentrations of Hg2+ ions, and (b) single strand fluorescence quenching with time (in

Analysis of Mercury in
Real Water Samples
To validate
the sensing ability of the developed EST-AuNCs in real water samples,
collected water samples were spiked with the Hg2+ (100
nM). The paper strips were treated with the water, and photos of each
paper strip was captured at each 5 min interval. The results suggested
that the samples which were spiked with the Hg2+ showed
significant fluorescence inhibition, whereas samples without spiked
concentration of Hg2+ did not have any effect on the fluorescence
of the strips (Figure 8). These results also confirm that the other ions or chemicals present
in the water from various sources do not have any effect on the fluorescence
of the developed sensor. Thus, the results validated the stability
of the developed sensor strips. Furthermore, the accuracy of the fluorescence
quenching to determine the exact concentration in the real water samples
was determined. The results suggested that the spiked water sample
showed 94–98% accuracy with respect to the added amount of
Hg2+. Further, to confirm the accuracy of the method, the
quantitative inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
was performed which showed 97–99% accurate quantity of added
mercury (Table 2).
Overall, the developed EST-AuNCs is mostly free from the effect of
another component present in the real water sample from different
sources and determines the accuracy and reliability of the present
method for the determination of Hg2+ in real samples.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the red luminescent (Q, 7.8%) Au25NCs (<2 nm) using a new template (EST;
a well-known protein)
is successfully synthesized in a one-pot single-step method. The synthesized
EST-AuNCs are highly stable in solution or in solid form at various
pHs (4–12) as well as in higher salt concentration. The EST-AuNCs
are employed in the highly selective and sensitive detection of Hg2+ (LOD, 0.88 nM). Moreover, the paper test strips are useful
for the rapid visual detection of Hg2+ in the samples.
Test strips are also useful for real-time Hg2+ sensing
using CLSM. The developed strips also showed their ability to sense
the Hg2+ in the real water samples from different sources.
The validation study confirmed the accuracy of sensing, more than
95%. Because of the unique conjugation and interaction properties
of the protein/peptides, these NCs are not only were employed in the
detection of Hg2+ but could be applicable for many other
applications in material, biomedical, and catalysis science.

Various other analytical grade chemicals and organic solvents were
purchased from the suitable vendors.

Synthesis of Fluorescent
EST-AuNCs
Glassware’s
were carefully washed with Aqua Regia, acetone, and deionized water.
The reaction conditions were optimized for the synthesis of EST-AuNCs
before the final synthesis. To synthesize EST-AuNCs, 10 mL of aqueous
solution of AuCl3 (6 mM) containing 1 mL 1 M NaOH was added
dropwise to EST solution (15 mg/mL) under stirring at 600 rpm. After
2 min, the stirring rate was adjusted to 150 rpm and the reaction
was allowed to proceed for 18 h at 35 °C. There was no obvious
color change observed in visible light; however, it showed red fluorescence
under UV at 365 nm. This solution was used for further characterization
and stored at 4 °C for further use. EST-AuNCs were purified through
dialysis (membrane cut-off; 10 kDa) in deionized water at 4 °C
for 24 h to get rid of unreacted salt and NaOH. The purified AuNCs
were lyophilized and stored at 4 °C for further characterization
and use.

Characterization
The absorption and fluorescence spectra
were recorded using Hitachi U-3900 UV–vis spectrophotometer
and Varian carry-eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent),
respectively. The fluorescence lifetime was recorded using Deltaflex
modular fluorescence lifetime system (Horiba scientific). The particle
size and zeta potential of EST-AuNCs were recorded using Zetasizer
(Malvern Instruments, UK). The Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer
(Bruker) was used to analyze the molecular weights of EST and EST-AuNCs.
An X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometer (XPS, PHI 5000 Versa Prob
II, FEI Inc.) was used to determine the binding energy of gold and
mercury atoms. Functional groups of EST and EST-AuNCs were analyzed
using an FTIR synthesis monitoring system equipped with an ATR and
IR microscope (PerkinElmer). XRD spectra were recorded using a D8
Brucker XRD instrument. The thermal stability was characterized using
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC 821e, Mettler Toledo). The
structural changes in protein structure were determined using CD spectroscopy
(Jasco J-815 CD spectrophotometer, USA). FEI Tecnai HRTEM fitted with
EDS was used to perform TEM and line EDS mapping of elements.

Detection
of Hg2+ Using EST-AuNCs and Selectivity
Study
The solution of EST-AuNCs (20 μM) was prepared
in 1 M NaCl salt solution, and the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The solution
of different inorganic heavy metal salts (final concentration 30 μM;
Hg2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Se4+, Cu2+, Al3+, Sn2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+) was added to glass vials containing
200 μL solution of EST-AuNCs, separately. Each vial was then
sonicated for 3 min and set aside for 30 min to complete the reaction.
The solution in vials was then observed under UV at 365 nm. This study
was performed for the initial screening and selectivity of fluorescence
quenching in the presence of various salts. In another study, various
other compounds (urea, oxalic acid, uric acid, hydrogen peroxide,
and Na2SO4; 30 μM each) were added to
the EST-AuNCs solution, and the effect on the fluorescence was determined.
To determine the mercury sensing limit, the aqueous solution of EST-AuNCs
(25 nM, pH 7.2) having 1 M NaCl, different concentrations of Hg2+ were added to make its final concentration (0.025–100
nM), separately (n = 6). The reaction mixtures were
then sonicated for 3 min and set aside for 30 min to ensure the completion
of the reaction. The fluorescence spectra were recorded at emission
range 550–700 nm with λex 480 nm (slit width
20 each; excitation and emission). The relationship between the relative
integrated intensities and Hg2+ concentration was plotted.
The LOD and linear detection range of Hg2+ were determined.

Development of Test Strips to Sense Hg2+
In the
solution of EST-AuNCs (10 mL), small pieces (1 × 2 cm)
of filter paper (41 no. Whatman) were soaked for 24 h. These papers
were air-dried and stored at 4 °C for further use. To sense Hg2+, 25 μL of Hg2+ solution of varied concentration
was spotted on the separate strip and analyzed under UV (365 nm) after
air drying. The color changes at various Hg2+ concentrations
were observed. Test strips for CLSM were developed by soaking the
filter strips into the EST-AuNCs solution (50 nM) for 24 h and simultaneously
washed in deionized water with shaking for 15 min. Completely air-dried
strips were then treated with various concentrations of Hg2+ and analyzed under CLSM at excitation wavelength of 488 nm. The
real-time sensing of Hg2+ was determined under CLSM using
100 nM Hg2+ by recording the images at a different time
intervals.

Validation of the Sensing Ability Using Real
Water Samples
Water samples from various sources (tap water
from NIPER SAS Nagar,
water from sewerage treatment plant NIPER SAS Nagar, water from Chandigarh-Mohali
city runnel) were collected. Water samples were initially centrifuged
at 10 000g for 30 min, and the supernatant
was collected. The supernatant was filtered through 0.22 μm
filter tailored with the syringe filter assembly. The test strips
were treated with the filtered water samples separately, and fluorescence
of strips was observed under UV light (365 nm) and recorded up to
30 min. Further, in a separate experiment, water samples were spiked
with Hg2+ (100 nM final concentration) before the centrifugation
and filtration steps. After the centrifugation and filtration, the
test strips were treated with the resulted water samples. The fluorescence
of test strips was observed for 30 min under 365 nm UV light. Furthermore,
to validate the ability of the method for the linear detection of
the mercury in the real water samples, different concentrations of
mercury solutions were prepared. The prepared solutions were mixed
with the EST-AuNCs solutions separately up to 5, 10, 20, and 30 nM
(final concentration) of Hg2+. The integrated fluorescence
intensities of the resulted solution were recorded and the Hg2+ concentration was calculated using the standard linear equation
of fluorescence quenching. The accuracy of the method was validated
by measuring its concentration using ICP-MS (7700 series, Agilent
Technologies).
