This work reports on the synthesis
of three new l-lysine-based
organogelators bis(N2-alkanoyl-N6-l-lysyl ethylester)oxalylamides, where alkanoyls are lauroyl, myristoyl,
and palmitoyl. The gels of these gelators were prepared with high
yields in eco-friendly solvents commonly used in cosmetics such as
ethyl and isopropyl esters of lauric and myristic acids, liquid paraffin,
1-decanol, and 1,2-propanediol. Fourier transform infrared measurements
revealed the involvement of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the gelation.
Scanning electron microscopy images of xerogels indicated different
morphologic patterns with regard to the alkanoyl chain length and
the solvent employed in their preparation. The gel formation was supported
by rheological measurements. Three gels prepared in liquid paraffin
were loaded with naproxen (Npx) with a quite high loading capacity
(up to 166.6% as percentage of gelator) without gel disruption. The
release of Npx from the gel matrix into the buffered solution at physiologic
pH was evaluated using UV–vis spectroscopy. The results revealed
that the release rate of Npx from the organogels significantly retarded
with increasing organogelator concentration, whereas it enhanced with
increasing Npx concentration. The rate was also found to be pH-dependent;
the lower the pH, the lower the rate. Furthermore, molecular dynamic
calculations performed on the octamer of myristoyl-bearing gelator
(N2M/N6Lys) in 1,2-propanediol provided useful
information regarding the structural properties of the gels, which
may be of interest to interpret the structure of the gel matrix. Altogether,
this work provided valuable outcomes, which may be relevant to the
pharmaceutical industry. It may be suggested that l-lysine-based
gels have potentials in the delivery of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug molecules. Besides, the release of the drug can be fine-tuned
by the correct choice of gelator–solvent combination.

1 Introduction
The
hunt for rational design of small molecules with the ability
to self-assemle in a predictable way for a specific purpose has become
a long journey of scientists, which is inspired by highly selective
and enormous catalytic functions of macromolecules in living cells.
One of the examples of these is the design of molecules with gelation
properties, which have many applications,1,2 including
biomedicine, especially for tissue engineering and drug delivery.3−13 Gels have important soft material properties, formed by self-aggregation
from small low-molecular-weight compounds via noncovalent interactions,
leading to immobilization of solvents.14 If the solvent is water, the gels are called hydrogels, otherwise
they are called organogels. They are largely classified as low-molecular-weight
gelators (LMWGs), most of which bear short peptides or peptidomimetics.15 Hence, the design of biocompatible LMWGs for
the drug delivery forms a good stand in the field.16 They may be derived from naturally occurring precursors
such as amino acids,17−31 carbohydrates,32−34 and lipids.35 Amino acids
offer a good standpoint for preparing synthetic organogelators, as
alternatives to the naturally occurring ones like lecithin, which
are expensive and lack large-scale production. Their synthetic procedures
are relatively easy and well established. Furthermore, their natural
abundance makes amino acids as the main starting materials in the
development of gelators.

The synthesis of the l-lysine-based
gemini organogelators
was originally reported by Hanabusa et al.36 involving an oxalayl bridge joining two l-lysine units
via N2-amine sites. However, in the current study, two
lysines were linked by an oxalayl bridge via N6-amine heads.
This provides an advantage since the synthesis involves a straightforward
step and hence does not require any protection. The remaining free
N2-amines were then converted into amides with acid chlorides
derived from naturally occurring carboxylic acids. Thus, as a result,
three new l-lysine-based biocompatible gelators, bearing
alkanoyl groups, bis(N2-lauroyl-N6-l-lysyl ethylester)oxalylamides (N2L/N6Lys),
bis(N2-myristoyl-N6-l-lysyl ethylester)oxalylamides
(N2M/N6Lys), and bis(N2-palmitoyl-N6-l-lysyl ethyl ester) oxalylamides (N2P/N6Lys), were prepared and they were found to be excellent
gelators, producing transparent gels in biocompatible organic solvents
such as ethyl and isopropyl esters of lauric and myristic acids, liquid
paraffin, 1-decanol, and 1,2-propanediol. We have recently reported
the preparation of organogels in biocompatible solvents (fatty acid
ethyl and isopropyl esters of different chain lengths), and they were
employed as drug carriers for a nonstereodial anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) ibuprofen.37 Consequently, the
current study covers the investigation of the effect of the length
of alkanoyl groups and solvents on gelation properties such as the
minimum gelator concentration, morphology of xerogels, gel–sol
transition temperatures, and gel strength. It also involves studying
the drug loading and controllable release behaviors of these gelators
in vitro for the transport of NSAID drug naproxen (Npx). The choice
of Npx as model drug is based on its solubility in water and the relatively
high UV absorbance properties. Furthermore, computational calculations
were performed to understand the structural characteristics of the
gel matrixes. Molecular dynamic calculations for the octamer of N2M/N6Lys in 1,2-propandiol solvent box produce valuable
information regarding the structure of aggragates of the gel matrix.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
All
chemicals were purchased
from commercial sources (Merck, Fluka, and Sigma-Aldrich) and used
without further purification if not mentioned otherwise. Lauric acid
ethylester (LEE), lauric acid isoproply ester (LIE), myristic acid
ethylester (MEE), and myristic acid isoproply ester (MIE) were prepared
by protocols described in the literature.38,39 The desired fatty acid isopropyl esters were obtained in high yields
(88–94%) by treating the appropriate fatty acid with alcohol
in large molar excess, in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluene sulfonic acid.

2.2 Techniques
The structural properties
of gelators were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) using Mattson 1000, ATI UNICAM machine equipped with Specac
GS20730 model heating apparatus. The samples were prepared by placing
the gel in KBr disks and scanned in the 4000–400 cm–1 range. 1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 High Performance Digital
FT-NMR spectrometer, and chemical shifts were reported in ppm. UV–vis
measurements were carried out using VARIAN UV1010M211 CARY 100 BIO
UV–visible spectrophotometer. Rheological measurements were
carried out with an Anton PAR MCR 301 with a cone-plate (20 mm diameter)
stress-controlled rheometer. Optical rotations were measured using
PerkinElmer 341 model Polarymeter apparatus. Shimatzu LC-MS 8040 was
used to record mass spectra. Chemical analyses (C, H, and N) were
carried out using Carlo-Erba 1108 model apparatus. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) observations were carried out using an FEI Quanta
250 FEG field emission scanning microscope. pH measurements were carried
out with a Mettler Toledo GmbH 8603 pH meter, calibrated with the
standard buffers.

2.4 Gelation Studies
2.4.1 Preparation
of the Organogels
Required
amounts of the compounds in 1 mL of organic solvent were placed in
a screw-capped tube with an internal diameter (i.d.) of 10 mm and
slowly heated until the solid was completely dissolved. Then, the
solutions were cooled (undisturbed) to room temperature. After 1 h,
colorless and transparent gels were obtained. They were assessed as
stable by inversion of the glass tube.

2.4.2 Determination
of the Minimum Gel Concentration
(MGC)
The gelation test was carried out by following the
procedure mentioned in the literature.41 A gelator (1 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of an organic solvent. The
mixture was heated up to a temperature of 20 °C below the boiling
point of the solvent until the gelator has completely been dissolved.
Then, the solution was allowed to stand in a thermostated water bath
at 25 °C. After about 15 min, it was checked if the solution
was gelled, if not, then 1 mg of more gelator was added and the procedure
was repeated until the gelation occurs. The concentration where the
gelation occurs is recorded as the minimum gelation concentration
(MGC) (mg/mL). In the case when 1 mg of the gelator could not be dissolved
in 1 mL of the specified solvent, this was reported as the gelator
is not soluble in this specific solvent. On the other hand, if the
gelator is soluble in over 10% of the specific solvent, then the gelator
was referred as soluble in this specific solvent.

2.4.3 Determination of Gel–Sol Transition
Temperature (Tg)
The gel prepared
in 1 mL of organic solvent in a test tube with internal diameter (i.d.)
of 10 mm was kept at 25 °C for 6 h. All of the glass tubes having
standard dimension of 12 mm × 75 mm were used and a steel ball
with a weight of 0.25 g was carefully placed on the surface of the
gel in this tube in an oil bath with a temperature controller. The
bath was heated at 1 °C intervals until the ball falls down the
bottom of the tube, which corresponds to the melting point (gel–sol
transition temperature) (Tg) of the gelator.
This ensures that stress generated by the gel on the measurement of
its melting point is approximately constant in each case. This procedure
was repeated with different concentrations of gelators.42

2.4.4 Microscopy Studies
The reprecipitation
approach was followed in the preparation of samples for SEM analyses
since the dried samples were prepared by the deposition method,43 where the deposition of a gel sample followed
by drying in vacuum is too difficult to handle because of the high
boiling point of solvents. This concurrently causes the deformation
of xerogels. So, xerogels were prepared by following a previously
reported method.43 A quick precipitation
of gels from organic fluids in hexane is very useful for sample preparation,
where their nanoscaled network is still maintained by the quick precipitation.
The samples were prepared by rapid stirring of the gel obtained from
organic fluids either with a magnet or a vortex followed by addition
of hexane. Gelators were participated as fibers, and the solvent was
removed via a Pasteur pipette. Centrifugation (6000 rpm) was applied
to the cases where the separation of the layers is not good enough.
The addition and separation of hexane were repeated until all high-boiling-point
fluids have been washed away. The excess of hexane was removed by
freeze-drying for 24 h.

2.4.5 Determination of Gel–Sol
Transition
Enthalpy (ΔHm)
The enthalpy
of gel–sol transition was determined using the van’t
Hoff equation (eq 1.)44,45 by plotting ln [Cm] versus 1/Tg, where Cm corresponds
to the concentration of gelator as mol L–1, Tg corresponds to the phase-transition temperature,
and R corresponds to the Rydberg gas constant (R = 8.314 J mol–1 K–1) 1  

2.4.6 Rheology Measurements
The viscoelastic
properties of the gels obtained from N2L/N6Lys, N2M/N6Lys, and N2P/N6Lys gelators
in liquid paraffin and 1-decanol were measured by a 20 mm cone-plate
stress-controlled rheometer (Anton PAR MCR 301) at a constant shear
stress (1.3 Pa) and at 25 °C. The width of the gap was 0.047
mm. Oscillatory amplitude sweep experiments (γ: 0.01–100%)
were carried out at a fixed frequency of 10 rad s–1, to determine the linear viscoelastic (LVE) range and the crossover
point of the gels (G″ > G′). The samples were prepared the day before the analysis
and left overnight at a controlled temperature of 25 °C to complete
the gelation process. The set sample was placed on the plain sample
surface of the rheometer. After establishing the LVE of each organogel,
frequency sweep tests were performed at a constant shear stress within
the LVE region of each sample. Then, the experiment was done in frequency
sweep modes with 1% strain.

2.5 Computational
Modeling
The monomer
composed of alkanoyl, oxalyl, and lysine was optimized using AM146 by Gaussain 03.47 Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement (AMBER version 11)
was used for the molecular dynamic calculations.48 Atomic charges were derived by antechamber as implemented
in AMBER, and they were corrected for the equivalent atoms.49 ff99SB50 library
was employed for the atom types and parameter/topology. The angle
parameters for N–C–C backbone in oxylyl linkage were
adopted from the general amber force field (GAFF) library.51 Xleap as implemented in AMBER was used to derive
library for the components of the monomer and to solvate the tetramer
and polymeric forms of the gelator as well as to form parameter/topology
and coordinate files. The octamer form of the gelator was contracted
by Discovery Studio Visulazer 4.152 using
the minimized monomer and followed by AM1 calculation to minimize
the aggregate. Then, the individual coordinates in the minimized octamer
were used for the molecular dynamic calculations. 1,2-Propanediol
was also minimized by AM1, and charges for each of its atoms were
derived by antechamber. A solvent box (PRPPBOX) was derived from this
molecule composed of 20 molecules. Xleap was used to prepare the octamer
in 1,2-propanediol. Systems were minimized in two steps. In the first
step, the gelator molecules were kept fixed; only 1,2-propandiol molecules
were allowed to move. In the second step, all of the atoms were allowed
to move. In both steps, calculations were performed in 5000 steps:
2500 steps with the steepest descent method and 2500 steps with the
conjugate gradient method. Heating was performed in the canonical
ensemble for 200 ps, where the aggregates of gelator were restrained
with a force constant of 10 kcal mol–1 Å–2. Equilibration was performed for 17.5 ns in a canonical
ensemble at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm. The step
size was 2 fs during the entire simulation. A Langevin thermostat
and barostat were used to couple the temperature and pressure. The
SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain all bonds containing hydrogen
atoms.53 The nonbonded cutoff was kept
at 10 Å, and long-range electrostatic interactions were treated
using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME)54 method
with a fast Fourier transform grid with a spacing of approximately
0.1 nm. Cluster analyses were done using Chimera UCSF,55 which is also used for the visualization of
molecular dynamic trajactories. Ptraj module as implemented in AMBER
was used to calculate RMSD changes, hydrogen-bond analyses, and radial
distribution function (RDF).56 The graphical
outcomes of all of these analyses were represented by GraphPad Pris
4.

2.6 Drug Loading and Release
2.6.1 Drug Loading
Loading of Npx into
the gel network was carried out by the following procedure as described
in the literature.37 This involves heating
a mixture of the drug (3.0 mg), the solvent (1.0 mL), and the gelator
(4.0 mg) in a septum-capped tube with an internal diameter of 10 mm;
the mixture was heated in an oil bath to a temperature of 20 °C
below the boiling point of the solvent until achieving a homogenous
solution, followed by cooling the solution to 25 °C and kept
it undisturbed at this temperature for about 6 h to ensure that the
gelation occurs, observed by the stability of the mixture by inversion
of the glass tube.

The drug loading capacities of gelators were
obtained by a slow successive addition of Npx to the prepared gels
(on the gelators MGC 6.0 mg) in different solvents (1 mL) until the
gel structures are reproduced. The maximum drug loading capacity (MDLC)
of gelators was found from the following equation (eq 2) 2  where wd is the
weight of drug loaded in the gel and wg is the weight of gelator in the gel matrix.

2.6.2 Drug Release
The Higuchi equation
(eq 3) was employed to
quantify drug release from organogels into artificial physiological
fluid. This equation provides possibilities both to facilitate device
optimization and to better understand the underlying drug release
mechanisms.57 3  where Mt is the
cumulative absolute amount of drug released at time t, M∞ is the cumulative absolute
amount of drug released at infinite time, k is a
constant reflecting the design variables of the system, and t is the time.

UV–vis spectroscopy was used
to determine the amount of drug released. UV–vis scanning indicates
that Npx has a maximum UV absorption wavelength at 262 nm where the
gelators have no absorption. For a typical drug release experiment,
6 mL of buffer (0.1 M phosphate) was placed on the top of the drug
loaded gel in glass tube as described above in a thermostated bath
at 25 °C. With time intervals of 1 h for a period of 9 h, 3 mL
of sample was taken from the buffered solution and the amount of the
drug released was determined by UV. Fresh buffered solution (3 mL)
was added to maintain the initial amount of 6 mL of buffered solution.
This procedure was followed to see the effect of solvent, pH (pH 5.0,
7.0, and 7.4), concentration of Npx, and gelators on the release rate.
The effect of Npx concentration (0.5–5 mg) on the cumulative
release was measured from N2M/N6Lys (4.0 mg) gel
in liquid paraffin (1.0 mL) at pH 7.4 (0.1 M phosphate buffer) and
25 °C since the drug cumulative release quantity was low in this
gel. N2P/N6Lys showed the highest drug loading capacity
in all of the tested fluids. Hence, the effect of solvent on the drug
release was measured with this gelator. The gel forms of N2P/N6Lys (6 mg) containing Npx (3 mg) are prepared in 1 mL
of four different solvents (LEE, 1-decanol, 1,2-propandiol, and liquid
paraffin) and the release rate of Npx into 6 mL of the buffered solution
(0.1 M phosphate) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C was measured. The effect
of pH (at three different pH values: 5.0, 7.0, and 7.4) on the release
of Npx was studied in LEE since the highest release is observed (40%
within 24 h) in this solvent. The effect of concentration of gelators
on cumulative release of Npx (3 mg) in liquid paraffin was studied
at two different gel concentrations (4 and 6 mg) at pH 7.4 (0.1 M
phosphate buffer) and 25 °C. For all of the measurements, each
point represents the mean value ± SD (n = 3).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The synthesis and applications
of biocompatible l-lysine-based LMWOGs have widely been reported.58 They are generally linked via N2 end
to form C2 symmetric structures. The current
work involves the synthesis of l-lysine-based LMWOG via the
selective N6 linkage using oxalyl as a linker. Moreover,
lauric, myristoic, and palmitoic acid chlorides were used to acylate l-lysine at the N2 end to produce three different
gelators bearing hydrophobic site chains with different lengths. These
organogelators, N2L/N6Lys, N2M/ N6Lys, and N2P/N6Lys, are composed of residues from
natural resources and prepared with high yield by facile synthetic
paths (Scheme 1), which
were fully characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), NMR,
and mass spectrometry techniques.

3.2 Gelation and Gel Properties
The gel
formation of these gelators (N2L/N6Lys, N2M/ N6Lys, and N2P/N6Lys) was studied
in common cosmetic solvents such as LEE, LIE, MEE, MIE, 1,2-propandiol,
and 1-decanol. It was found that they all form gel in these solvents
with MGCs in the range of 4–6 mg/mL (Table 1), mostly possessing a transparent appearance
(Figure 1). They provide
a system prepared from natural sources, which could be used for the
drug delivery/release applications.

The gel–sol transition
temperature (Tg) offers useful information
regarding the stability of the
gels. The data obtained for concentration-dependent Tg of each gelator in different solvents (1 mL) are presented
in the Supporting Information (Tables S1–S7). They indicate that increasing the concentration of the gelator
increases the thermal stability of the gels (Figure 2). The highest Tg values are obtained for the gels in liquid paraffin even at lower
concentrations (Table S3). This may be
attributed to the fact that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are
stronger in this solvent compared to the rest. It is expected that
hydrophilic solvents such as 1-decanol and 1,2-propanediol would have
competition to form hydrogen bonds with the gelator, thus weakening
the intermolecular interactions between the gelator molecules (Figure S21 and Table S2). Besides, Tg’s for these hydrophilic gels are low, indicating
that the drug loading temperature is comparable to body temperature,
which prohibits the racemization of chiral drugs, during loading processes.

Figure 2 Plot of Tg versus the weight of gelators Cg (% w) in liquid paraffin.

The key role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the formation
of these gels was qualitatively identified by FT-IR analyses. Temperature-dependent
(25–110 °C) IR spectrum of N2M/N6Lys with Tg of 104 °C in MIE is displayed in Figure 3. It demonstrates
that there are hydrogen bonds involving NH and C=O in the gel.
These intermolecular interactions disappear at 110 °C, corresponding
to the temperature above the gel–sol transition. The bands
corresponding to the NH stretching at 3288 and 3325 cm–1 at lower temperatures below Tg are shifted
to 3350 and 3400 cm–1 at the temperature above Tg (110 °C). This clearly demonstrates the
involvement of NH functions via the hydrogen bonds in maintaining
the 3D structure of the gel (Figure 3, right). A similar pattern was found for the C=O
stretching: the possible intermolecular interactions indicated by
C=O stretching appearing at 1650 (amide I) and 1530 (amide
II) cm–1 are shifted to 1693 and 1501 cm–1, respectively, in the free form at 110 °C (Figure 3, left).

Figure 3 Temperature-dependent
IR spectra corresponding to C=O (left)
and NH (right) stretching bands for gelator N2M/N6Lys (12 mg) in 1 mL of MIE.

Temperature-dependent IR spectrum of N2M/N6Lys with Tg of 124 °C in liquid paraffin
is displayed
in Figure 4. A similar
observation obtained for the spectra in MIE was also seen for this
gelator in paraffin (Figure 4). The hydrogen bonds between NH and C=O in the gel
are represented by the NH stretching at 3284 at lower temperatures,
below Tg (Figure 4, right). This peak is shifted to 3400 cm–1 at the temperature above the gel–sol transition
(Figure 4, right).
This shift is a clear indication of the disappearance of the intermolecular
hydrogen bonds. The peak corresponding to the C=O stretching
at 1650 (amide I) and 1530 (amide II) cm–1 are shifted
to 1690 and 1500 cm–1 at 130 °C (Figure 4, left). Similarly, this indicates
that carbonyl functions are involved in the intermolecular interaction
in the gels for the formation of the matrix.

It is known that gels spontaneously self-aggregate
to form a 3D
network structure via entwined nanofibers,59 which can be observed by electron microscopy. The preparation of
samples for SEM analyses involves drying samples in vacuum following
deposition of solvents from gel samples. Unfortunately, the solvents
used in the preparation of the gels in the present study have higher
boiling points, which hampers the direct preparation of xerogels by
the freeze-drying technique for SEM analyses. Thus, the reprecipitation
procedure was employed for the preparation of samples.43 The nanoscale network structures of the gels
remain unchanged by shaking the samples with hexane. However, this
may cause the deformation of xerogel form. The SEM images of N2L/N6Lys, N2M/N6Lys, and N2P/N6Lys are presented in Figure 5. They indicate that the solvents and the chain length
of alkanoyl parts in the gelators influence the morphology of xerogels
(Figure 5). The xerogel
of N2L/N6Lys seems to be self-assembled in a cross-linked
and entangled manner in liquid paraffin compared to that in 1-decanol.
This may be associated with the different hydrogen-bond patterns in
different solvents. The gels in liquid paraffin have probably stronger
hydrogen-bond network compared to those in 1-decanol. The structure
with the shortest alkanoyl site arms (N2L/N6Lys)
has an entangled string appearance in liquid paraffin, while it produces
rather a smooth stringlike pattern in 1-decanol. On the other hand,
medium-sized N2M/N6Lys has a flat and thicker
fiber structure than N2L/N6Lys in 1-decanol.
The gel with the longest arm chain (N2P/N6Lys)
gives a spongelike pattern in liquid paraffin. So, hydrogen bonds,
as expected, are key players in the self-aggregation process of the
gelation, but the alkanoyl groups appear also to play a significant
role in the formation of nanostructures of these gels.

Determination of physical properties of gels is
important for the
prediction of their specific role in many applications, particularly
thermodynamic parameters are of great importance. For example, the
van’t Hoff equation (eq 1) may be used to calculate the gel–sol transition enthalpy
if the gel–sol transition is comparable to the melting of crystals.44,45 The gelation enthalpies obtained from eq 1 by plotting ln [Cm] vs 1/Tg (see Figures S3–S9 in the Supporting Information) for three gelators
in different solvents are given in Table 2.

1-decanol	37.8	78.2	93.2	
1,2-propandiol	100.6	109.7	73.8	
The effect of solvents
on the gel–sol transition enthalpy
(ΔHsol) is summarized in Table 2, where ΔHsol is roughly considered as ΔH in the van’t Hoff equation. However, it is very
difficult to make a straightforward statement about the influence
of the solvent on the thermal stability of the gels. On the other
hand, it is clear that N2M/N6Lys possesses lower
stability almost in all solvents, except in LEE and 1-decanol and N2P/N6Lys have higher stability in almost all solvents,
except in MIE and 1-decanol (comparable stability to N2P/N6Lys in paraffin (80 vs 78.1 kJ mol–1).

Moreover, enthalpies for the gels in LEE and 1-decanol offer
a
reasonable order to correlate the stability of gels with the polarity
of solvents and the length of site arms, namely, lauroyl, myristoyl,
and palmitoyl. As the length increases, the stability decreases in
1-decanol, whereas the order is reversed in LEE (Table 2). So, there is a critical point
in the thermal stability of gels governed by a balance between the
polarity of the solvent and the hydrophilicity of the gelator.

The rheological behavior of the gels in liquid paraffin and 1-decanol
are represented in Figure 6. For all of the organogels tested, the storage modulus (G′) was higher than the loss modulus (G″) over the frequency ranges at 1% strain (lower than the
yield strain) (Table 3). This produces smaller values of G″/G′, which corresponds to the loss factor, defined
as tan δ (tan δ = G″/G′), an indication of the elastic nature of the gels.
Hence, all of the gels show elastic nature. This may be considered
as a measure of the consistency parameter for dermal and transdermal
applications, which is important for the drug-resident period on the
application region and drug absorption via skin and drug release.60

(8 mg/mL).

There are two other rheological parameters for the
description
of the gel properties, which are important indicators for their drug
carrier properties in the dermal and topical applications. These are
the complex viscosity η* (η* = G*/ω)
and complex modulus G* (G* = G′ + G″). The former is defined
as the total resistance of the network structure against the applied
strain, while the latter represents the energy involved in the interactions
between the network elements.61 The lower
η* means a thinner layer of semisolid, which indicates that
the gels with optimal low values of η* could be applied to the
skin, resulting in more rapid absorption of drug.62 Data demonstrate that all of the gel systems possess reliable
viscous properties but N2M/N6Lys/liquid paraffin
and N2L/N6Lys/1-decanol have more viscous nature,
and therefore this gelator in both fluids produce sufficiently stable
organogels with moderate energy (Table 3). And consequently, N2P/N6Lys/1-decanol
and N2P/N6Lys/liquid paraffin systems may be regarded
as better candidates of drug carries.

3.3 Computational
Modeling
As far as
our current knowledge of the literature is concerned, there are a
few reports on the computational modeling of gel structure.63−65 Although the gel structures are thought to be compact organizations,
it is important to know about their structural properties and their
interaction pattern with the solvent. Here, we report a detailed computational
calculation, including semiempiric and molecular dynamic calculations,
for the octomer of N2M/N6Lys. The octomer was constructed
from a minimized monomer at AM1 level by considering as much as possible
intermolecular hydrogen-bond interactions. The minimized octamer indicates
that the oxalate-lysine backbone tends to bend, producing a spiral
structure with a DNA-like pattern where alkyl long chains line up
in a parallel manner (Figure 7). It also demonstrates that apart from the oxalate residue,
alkanoyl-lysine amides are involved in the interactions, whereas the
ester functions lie outside of the frame. This is consistent with
the experimental observations by IR. Potential energy of the system
as a function of time during MD for a period of 17.5 ns at 300 K and
the RMSD of the octamer during the same MD calculations compared to
its starting coordinates are presented in Figure 8. The energy change indicates the conversion
of the system to a reasonable level, and RMSD changes demonstrate
that the system has achieved an acceptable equilibrium state.

structure of octamer of N2M/N6Lys.

Figure 8 (Left) Energies of the system as a function of time during
MD for
a period of 17.5 ns at 300 K and (right) RMSD of the octamer during
the same MD simulations, compared to its starting coordinates.

The calculations performed in
the solvent box of 1,2-propandiol
for the octomer of the gelator (N2M/N6Lys) provide
very interesting structural information for the aggregation phenomena
of the gelation. The results demonstrated that the bended octamer
structure is maintained during the molecular dynamic simulation (Figure 9). Hydrogen-bond
analyses between donors and acceptors are presented in Table 4. They display that the average
hydrogen bonds between the oxalyl functions (Hbond4 and Hbond5) are relatively shorter, and hence they are thought
to be the main driving forces for maintaining the 3D structure of
the gels. On the other hand, the amide hydrogen of myristoyl tends
to form hydrogen bonds with its carbonyl counterpart (Hbond1 and Hbond4) rather than with the ester functions (Hbond2 and Hbond5) since the latters have larger
average bond distances. This is consistent with the experimental observations
by FTIR as mentioned earlier. The other significant outcome is the
calculation of radial distribution functions (RDFs)56 from molecular dynamic trajectories. It provides data to
give the probability of finding a particle in the distance from another
particle. The distances between the acceptors in the solvent and potential
donors (O6, O7, and O8 in Scheme 1) in the gelator are calculated (Figure 10). They show the density distribution
of the solvent acceptors around three oxygens in the octamer. This
means that it is more likely that the solvent molecules would be in
contact with the gelator at around 2.5 Å.

3.4 In Vitro Drug Study
3.4.1 Drug Loading Capacity of Gelators
To relatively compare
the maximum drug loading capacity of the gels,
the same amount of the gelator (6 mg) was employed in all applications.
The calculated maximum amounts of Npx encapsulated by gelators prepared
in different solvents are given in Table 5. The relatively higher capacity displayed
by N2P/N6Lys and N2M/N6Lys in
all solvents may be associated with their longer chain length on the
N2-lysine amino group. It seems somehow the polarity of
the solvent also influences the loading capacity, the more polar the
lower capacity (Table 5). The loading of Npx into the gel network was studied by UV–vis
spectroscopy, as described in the Materials section. An image of Npx (3.0 mg) loaded N2M/N6Lys in liquid paraffin is demonstrated in Figure 11.

3.4.2 Drug Release
It is mainly possible
to apply a mathematical equation for the description of the time-dependent
release of drugs. This offers a very useful way for the prediction
of the kinetics of the release. There are many mathematical models
to design a number of simple and complex drug delivery systems. They
also predict the overall release behavior.57,66,67 The first mathematical model known as the
Higuchi equation proposed to explain the release of a drug from matrix
systems.57,57 This equation is the most common mathematical
model for the description of the release rate of drugs from matrix
systems. In our study, the linear responses of the cumulative release
amounts against the square root of time demonstrated that the release
of Npx from the gels followed the Higuchi equation and matrix diffusion
kinetics with a confidence (r = >0.99).66,67 Examples of the fitness of data to the Higuchi equation are shown
in Figure 12. They
all follow the Higuchi equation (eq 3) with good confidences.

paraffin at pH 7.4 (0.1 M phosphate
buffer) containing different concentrations of loaded Npx and 25 °C.
Data are fitted to eq 3. The numbers are the mean values of three parallel experiments.

3.4.2.1 Effect of Concentration
of Npx
Since the drug cumulative release quantity was low
from N2M/N6Lys (4.0 mg) gel in liquid paraffin (1.0
mL), the effect
of Npx concentration on the cumulative release quantity was studied
in this gel system at pH 7.4 (0.1 M phosphate buffer) and 25 °C.
The results are presented in Figure 12 (see data in Table S10).
They show that the cumulative release quantity increases with increasing
loaded Npx, where at lower concentrations (0.5–1.5 mg), the
difference is not large and at higher concentrations (3 and 5 mg),
the gap in the release rate is parabolically enhanced (Figure 12). This is possibly due to
the degradation of the gel structure in the presence of the larger
loaded Npx. And also cumulative released amount of Npx increases with
increasing quantity of loaded drug (Figure 13).

Figure 13 Cumulative release profiles from Npx-loaded N2M/N6Lys gel (4 mg gelator in 1 mL of liquid paraffin)
in the presence
of different loaded Npx concentrations at pH 7.4 (0.1 M phosphate
buffer) and 25 °C for the first 9 h period. The numbers are the
mean values of three parallel experiments.

3.4.2.2 Effect of Solvent
N2P/N6Lys has a high drug loading capacity in all of the tested
fluids. Hence, the effect of solvent on the drug release was investigated
with N2P/N6Lys gelator. The gel forms of N2P/N6Lys (6 mg) containing Npx (3 mg) are prepared in 1 mL
of four different solvents (LEE, 1-decanol, 1,2-propandiol, and liquid
paraffin). The data regarding the release of Npx from these gels into
6 mL of the buffered solution (0.1 M phosphate) at pH 7.4 and 25 °C
are shown in Figure 14 (see data in Table S8). The cumulative
release is 10% after 24 h in liquid paraffin, while this is 40% in
polar aprotic LEE, 27 and 30% in polar protic 1-decanol and 1,2-propanediol,
respectively. They show that the release is favored in polar fluids,
probably due to favorable interactions of polar gel liquids with water.
So, this offers an opportunity for controlling the time-dependent
release rate of the drug (Figure 14).

Figure 14 Time-dependent cumulative release as a percentage of Npx
(3 mg)
from N2P/N6Lys gel (6 mg gelator in 1 mL of different
solvents) at pH 7.4 (0.1 M phosphate buffer) and at 25 °C. The
numbers are the mean values of three parallel experiments.

3.4.2.3 Effect of pH
Topical delivery
system has many advantages to bypass first-pass metabolism. pH changes
play an essential role to avoid the risks and inconveniences of intravenous
therapy and various absorption conditions.68 The effect of pH on the release of Npx was studied in LEE since
the highest release is observed (40% within 24 h) in this solvent,
and therefore, it is expected that the measurement error will be minimized.
The results are represented in Figure 15 (see data in Table S9). They demonstrate that the release showed dependence on
pH, where it is slower at lower pH. This may be associated with the
ionization degree of Npx. It would be fully ionized at higher pHs,
and therefore, it would be expected to have an enhanced partition
into water phase from the gel at these pHs. In other words, at lower
pH, the neutral form of the drug would predominate, and consequently,
its partition rate into water phase would be declined since this form
likely tends to interact with the gel network instead of water phase.
The significance of the dependence of the release rate of Npx on pH
may be recognized in the different routes of administration such as
in skin,69 ophthalmic,70 and vagina.71,72

Figure 15 Effect of pH on the time-dependent cumulative
release as a percentage
of Npx from N2P/N6Lys gel prepared in LEE at
25 °C. The numbers are the mean values of three parallel experiments.

3.4.2.4 Effect
of Gelator Concentration
The changes in the release rate
of Npx with time from the gelators
(N2L/N6Lys, N2M/N6Lys, and N2P/N6Lys) prepared in paraffin at two different concentrations
(4.0 and 6.0 mg) are shown in Figure 16 (see data in Table S11).
They indicated, as expected, that the increase in the concentration
of the gelators reduces the release rate of Npx from the gels. Increasing
gelator concentration may lead to the formation of more complicated
gel matrix and hence possibly causes a decrease in the releasing of
Npx from this matrix. Diffusion-controlled drug release is supplied
by the solid skeletal network formed by the gelator molecules. The
gelator aggregates or fibers, which are responsible for the three-dimensional
structural network, immobilize the liquid via cross-linking and therefore
the higher amounts of the gelator would acts as an obstacle to the
passage of the drug out of the matrix. Thus, this could be employed
as a beneficial way in adjusting the drug release rate. The difference
in the release rate from the gels is likely associated with the strength
of the gel matrices in the presence of the drug. So, the higher rate
means the weaker interaction of Npx and hence the less stable gel
matrix. So, it appears that N2L/N6Lys forms less
stable gel than N2M/N6Lys and N2P/N6Lys in the presence of Npx (Figure 16).

mg) from liquid paraffin
gel containing different concentrations of gelators at pH 7.4 (0.1
M phosphate buffer) and 25 °C. The numbers are the mean values
of three parallel experiments.

4 Conclusions
This
study represents the preparation of three new low-molecular-weight
organogelators from constructed natural materials and their gelation
behaviors in cosmetic solvents. Rheological measurements and in vitro
drug release studies provided data that these gels could be promising
candidates as drug delivery matrix. Data also indicated that these
systems have a wide range of opportunities to control the release
rate and route of administration, which could be controlled by adjusting
some parameters such as solvent, concentration of gelator, pH, and
length of alkanoyl. Computational calculations offer very useful approach
for the prediction of structural and molecular dynamic properties
of gel systems. However, higher level of theories is needed to have
a better understanding of these complex systems.
