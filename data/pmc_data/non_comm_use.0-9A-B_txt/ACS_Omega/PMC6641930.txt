It was previously reported that two
naphthyl-based trans-stilbene probes, (E)-4-(2-(naphthalen-1-yl)vinyl)benzene-1,2-diol
(1) and (E)-4-(2-(naphthalen-2-yl)vinyl)benzene-1,2-diol
(3), can bind to both native transthyretin (TTR) and
misfolded protofibrillar TTR at physiological concentrations, displaying
distinct emission maxima bound to the different conformational states
(>100 nm difference). To further explore this amyloid probe scaffold
to obtain extended fluorescence lifetimes, two new analogues with
expanded aromatic ring systems (anthracene and pyrene), (E)-4-(2-(anthracen-2-yl)vinyl)benzene-1,2-diol (4) and
(E)-4-(2-(pyren-2-yl)vinyl)benzene-1,2-diol (5), were synthesized employing the palladium-catalyzed Mizoroki–Heck
reaction. (E)-4-Styrylbenzene-1,2-diol (2), 3, 4, and 5 were investigated
with respect to their photophysical properties in methanol and when
bound to insulin, lysozyme, and Aβ1-42 fibrils, including time-resolved
fluorescence measurements. In conclusion, 4 and 5 can bind to both native and fibrillar TTR, becoming highly
fluorescent. Compounds 2–5 bind specifically to
insulin, lysozyme, and Aβ1-42 fibrils with an apparent fluorescence
intensity increase and moderate binding affinities. The average fluorescence
lifetimes of the probes bound to Aβ1-42 fibrils are 1.3 ns (2), 1.5 ns (3), 5.7 ns (4), and
29.8 ns (5). In summary, the variable aromatic moieties
of the para-positioned trans-stilbenoid vinyl-benzene-1,2-diol
with benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene showed that the
extended conjugated systems retained the amyloid targeting properties
of the probes. Furthermore, both the anthracene and pyrene moieties
extensively enhanced the fluorescence intensity and prolonged lifetimes.
These attractive probe properties should improve amyloid detection
and characterization by fluorescence-based techniques.

Introduction
Many aspects of amyloid
fibrils have been studied owing to their
association with a variety of human diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
disease, type II diabetes, amyloidosis, and others.1−7 Amyloid fibrils form when native proteins misfold and self-assemble
into insoluble aggregates,8,9 which are deposited
in organs or tissues where the aggregates have a pathogenic effect.10 Up to date, several characteristics of the amyloid
fibril structure are widely accepted, for example, (1) mature fibrils
are composed of parallel β-strands, which are oriented perpendicular
to the long fibril axis,3,7,11,12 (2) mature fibrils have variable
lengths up to several micrometers with a width between 8 and 10 nm
and are often twisted and are generally unbranched.11−13 It has been
recently reported that most proteins could form amyloid fibrils under
specific conditions14,15 and that fibril formation is
an intrinsic property of the polypeptide backbone.3

Characterization of amyloid fibrils has been performed
by using
various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, such as atomic force
and electron microscopy, circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared,
luminescence, and others.16−18 The most commonly used, fast,
and reliable method for spectroscopic determination of amyloid fibril
formation is by using fluorescent dyes, such as luminescent conjugated
poly-, and oligothiophenes19,20 (LCP/LCO), Congo red
(CR), or thioflavin T (ThT). Furthermore, upon binding to amyloid
fibrils, CR generates a characteristic apple-green birefringence when
viewed through crossed polarizers, and a characteristic red shift
in absorbance maximum from about 490 nm to about 540 nm.21−24 However, it has been reported that CR can bind to native proteins.24 ThT, a charged molecular rotor molecule, shows
an apparent fluorescence intensity increase upon binding to fibrils
and its binding property is different at acidic and neutral pH,25−28 and it has been reported to bind poorly to transthyretin (TTR) fibrils
at an acidic pH.29 In addition, both LCOs
and ThT have a relatively short fluorescence lifetime with average t1/2 < 1 ns.29 We
have previously demonstrated the power of time-resolved fluorescence
for the characterization of oligomerization of amyloid proteins, allowing
both real-time detection of oligomerization and size distribution
analysis.17,29 Especially, a noncovalent small-molecule
amyloid targeting probe with an extended lifetime is desirable in
this regard. Here, there is ample room for current probe improvement
to facilitate detection and characterization of amyloid protein structures.
Such probes that utilize both spectral and temporal differences open
up alternative modes of detection, for example, fluorescence lifetime
imaging and related methods.30,31

In recent years,
various trans-stilbene-based
probes for the detection of amyloid fibrils and amyloidogenic proteins
have been reported (Chart 1). The Kelly group has reported that resveratrol can bind
native TTR and becomes fluorescent.32,33 [11C]BF-227 and 18F-florbetapir containing a trans-stilbenoid structure have been successfully used as positron emission
tomography ligands to trace cardiac TTR amyloid.34,35 Previously, we successfully developed two naphthyl-based trans-stilbene probes, (E)-4-(2-(naphthalen-1-yl)vinyl)benzene-1,2-diol
(1) and (E)-4-(2-(naphthalen-2-yl)vinyl)benzene-1,2-diol
(3), that can bind both native TTR and misfolded protofibrillar
TTR at physiological concentrations.36 These
probes displayed distinct shift in emission maxima (>100 nm) when
bound to the two different TTR conformations, allowing conformational
discrimination by fluorescence spectroscopy. Hence, this class of
compounds having a trans-stilbene or trans-stilbenoid structure are indeed a promising fluorescent probe scaffold
for amyloid research. Accordingly, we designed and prepared two new
analogues (4 and 5, see the structures in Chart 1), where the naphthyl
was replaced by anthracenyl or pyrenyl to investigate their spectral
discrimination of binding native and protofibrillar TTR as well as
three other canonical amyloid proteins. Subsequently, the emission
properties of these analogues (2–5) with different
aromatic ring moieties were investigated using steady-state and time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopies, which demonstrate the feasibility of
these new scaffolds for amyloid fibril characterization.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
All chemicals were obtained from
conventional commercial sources and used without further purification
unless otherwise noted. The synthesis of compound 2-(Bpin)pyrene (6) was performed according to the literature.37−39 The synthesis of compound 2-bromopyrene (7) was carried
out according to the literature.39−41 3,4-Dimethoxystyrene
(9) was synthesized according to the literature.42,43 The synthetic method of compounds 4 and 5 is shown in the Supporting Information. Thin layer chromatography was performed on Merck silica gel 60F254 glass-backed plates. Flash chromatography was carried out
with silica gel 60. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were
recorded on a Varian AVANCE 300 MHz instrument with solvent indicated.
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported
in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane or the residual
solvent protons.

Amyloid Fibril Formation
WT TTR
was isolated and purified,
as previously described.44 The TTR protein
concentration was determined using the molar extinction coefficient
(ε) of the monomeric TTR 18 289 M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm.45 The
fibrillation of native TTR in dH2O was induced by adding
a stock solution of 1 M NaAc and 2 M NaCl to a final concentration
of 50 mM NaAc and 100 mM NaCl (final pH 3.0). Concentration of the
insulin was determined by using ε = 5840 M–1 cm–1 at 277 nm. Bovine insulin fibril formation
was initiated by incubating 200 μM in 25 mM HCl (pH 1.6) at
65 °C.46 The chicken egg-white lysozyme
protein concentration was determined using the ε = 37 752
M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm, and fibril
formation was initiated using 200 μM at 65 °C in 25 mM
HCl (pH 1.6).46,47 Insulin and lysozyme fibrils
were dialyzed against 50 mM NaAc and 100 mM NaCl (final pH 3.0) prior
to measurements. Recombinant Aβ1-42 was expressed and purified
using the system described by Linse and co-workers,48 containing an additional methionine in the N-terminus.
Before the final step, the lyophilized Aβ1-42 sample was solubilized
in 6 M GuHCl before gel filtration on a Superdex 75 10/300 column
(GE-Healthcare) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer pH 7.5.
Freshly monomeric gel filtered Aβ1-42 was used in all experiments.
Peptide Aβ1-42 (Atlanta, GA, USA) without N-terminal methionine
from HFIP was also dissolved in 6 M GuHCl and gel filtered to make
comparable preparations. Aβ1-42 protein concentration was calculated
using ε = 1490 M–1 cm–1 at
277 nm. The Aβ1-42 fibrils were generated through incubation
of 10 μM Aβ1-42 at 37 °C in PBS buffer (pH 7.5) for
24 h under quiescent conditions. Fibril formation of TTR, insulin,
lysozyme, and Aβ1-42 was verified using the ThT (neutral pH)
and X-34 (acidic pH) fluorescence assays.

UV–Vis Absorption
Measurements
The ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption measurements were carried out employing
a Cary winUV 100 spectrophotometer, using a 1 cm quartz cuvette at
room temperature. The concentration of each probe was 20 μM
in methanol.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy Measurements
All fluorescence
spectra for each probe in methanol (20 μM) were recorded in
a Tecan Safire 2 Microplate reader (Tecan, Männerdorf, Switzerland)
or a Tecan infinite M1000 instrument and collected between 350 and
600 nm with the excitation wavelength at 330 nm at 1 nm spectral resolution.
Fluorescence analysis for each probe upon binding to native protein
or amyloid fibrils was carried out by mixing 1.0 μM of each
molecule from a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stock with 5 μM proteins
or fibrils (on a monomer basis) in PBS buffer (pH 7.5) or HOAc/NaAc
buffer (pH 3.0) for native proteins or fibrils, except for both native
(freshly dissolved monomeric) Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42 fibrils
in PBS buffer.

To avoid solubility problems for the probes,
we used variable fibril concentrations to a fixed low concentration
of probe to determine the binding affinity. A mixture (100 μL)
containing each probe (final concn 1 or 0.5 μM for Aβ1-42
fibrils) and fibrils (final concn 0–20 μM on a monomer
basis) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min to achieve equilibrium.
To assess the binding interactions in supermolecular chemistry is
not trivial.49 Especially, this is true
for amyloid fibrils that are known to be structurally heterogenous
and may contain several binding pockets for each fibril type.50 For this assay, we assumed that the fluorescence
increase in the complex between the fibril and the compound reports
on binding. A high-resolution probe binding pocket within model amyloid
fibrils has been defined,51 where CR (an
analogous molecule to our compounds) needs a defined pocket of sufficient
order lined by side chains to bind. From this model, it is observed
that a molecule of CR binds across six β-strands. In comparison,
the compounds of this study are half the size of CR and hence should
span three β-strands. From the experimental data, we assumed
the simplistic model of one saturable binding site for each fibril
protein. The fluorescence spectra were collected between 350 and 700
nm with excitation at 330 nm. The dissociation constant (Kd) of amyloid fibrils to each probe was calculated by
GraphPad Prism 7.01 using nonlinear fit with one binding site and
a fixed Bmax adjusting for the signal
from the unbound compound. All binding curves and fits are shown in
the Supporting Information.

Fluorescence
Lifetime Measurements
Fluorescence decays
were performed using an IBH time-correlated single photon counting
(TCSPC) spectrometer. The solution of each probe in methanol was degassed
with an argon gas, whereas the solution of each probe incubated with
amyloid fibrils was not. After the sample solution was excited at
337 nm, the fluorescence decays at each respective emission maximum
for each probe either free in methanol or bound to fibrils were monitored
at room temperature. The instrument response function was determined
with a fibril solution. Decays were fitted with a sum of exponentials
(eq 1), and the quality
of the fit was determined from the χ2 parameter,
the random distribution of the residuals, and the autocorrelation
of the residuals. 1  where αi is the pre-exponential factor associated with the decay time τi. The average lifetime of fluorescence decay
was calculated according to the following equation 2  

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Optical Characterization of trans-Stilbenoid
Derivatives
Our approach for the synthesis of
the trans-stilbene derivatives 4 and 5 was to apply the palladium-catalyzed Mizoroki–Heck
reaction of 9 to the corresponding 2-bromopyrene (7) and 2-bromoanthracene (10). Marder et al.
have reported the synthesis of 2- and 2,7-functionalized pyrene derivatives
including compounds 6 and 7 (Scheme 1).37−41 Employing the catalyst that was prepared in situ
by the reaction of [Ir(u-OMe)cod]2 with 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl (dtbpy), the product 6 was obtained in 62% yield. Then, the reaction of compound 6 with 3 equiv of CuBr2 in methanol/H2O (1:1) gave 7 in 78% yield. From 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde
(8), 9 was obtained by a witting reaction
in 59% isolated yield, in which the Mizoroki–Heck reaction
with 10 and 7 yielded the target molecules 4 and 5 in 35 and 28% isolated yields, respectively. Scheme 1 depicts the synthesis
of the target molecules.

dimer, dtbpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl.

After synthesis and purification, the photophysical
properties
of the probes (2–5), including absorption and
emission spectra in methanol, and extinction coefficients were determined
(Figure 1, Table 1, and Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information). Methanol was
a good solvent for the probes where absorbance showed clear linearity
over a concentration range up to 50 μM. In water, the absorbance
for 2 also showed a clear linearity over a concentration
range up to 50 μM or more, 3 (up to 10 μM), 4 (up to 5 μM), and 5 (up to 2 μM)
(Figure S1). Deviation from linearity above
these concentrations shows that aggregation or micelle formation occurs
above this concentration for each probe. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, the absorbance maxima are quite similar
and centered around 330 nm for the whole series except for 4 that has a double-peak shoulder extending toward 400 nm. The absorbance
peak for 2 was at 325 nm, 3 at 334 nm, and 4 at 335 nm. The lengthening of the π-conjugated system
leads to a progressive red shift of the emission maximum from 386
to 483 nm. Compound 5 was an exception with the emission
maximum at 415 nm. The progressive shift is ascribed to the lengthening
of the π-conjugation from the central moiety over the substituent,
whereas the emission at 415 nm for the pyrene variant suggests a weak
electronic interaction between the pyrene center and the dihydroxyphenyl
substituent.37,52 In conclusion, these probes showed
Stokes shifts ranging from 61 to 148 nm (Table 1) using methanol as the solvent.

ThT Fluorescence
is pH-Dependent
To benchmark our new
probes with established amyloid probes, we used ThT. ThT fluorescence
when bound to fibrils is known to be pH dependent.53 The fluorescence intensity of ThT when bound to different
amyloid fibrils at acidic pH (pH 3.0) or at neutral pH (pH 7.5) was
compared. Herein, TTR, insulin, lysozyme, and Aβ1-42 fibrils
were measured. As shown in Figure 2A,B, the fluorescence of ThT bound to amyloid fibrils
is very weak at pH 3.0 probably because of the electrostatic repulsion
of the dye by an increase in the positive charge. In general, the
fluorescence intensity of ThT upon binding to fibrils increased greatly
when comparing at acidic pH and neutral pH: TTR (4.3-fold), insulin
(57.1-fold), and lysozyme (3.1-fold), in agreement with our previous
paper.53

Figure 2 ThT shows pH-dependent fluorescence when
bound to amyloid fibrils.
(A) ThT fluorescence spectra of different amyloid fibrils in HOAc/NaAc
buffer (pH 3.0). (B) ThT fluorescence spectra of different amyloid
fibrils in PBS buffer (pH 7.5). All spectra were obtained at 5 μM
fibrils (on a monomer basis) + 1 μM ThT with identical settings.

trans-Stilbenoids 4 and 5 Bind to Native and Fibrillar TTR
Previously, compounds 1 and 3 were reported
to bind to native and misfolded
fibrillar TTR, providing distinguishable emission spectra that shifted
more than 100 nm for the two conformational states.36 Here, the binding response of the series 2–5 to native TTR and TTR fibrils was also determined by using fluorescence
spectroscopy (excitation: 330 nm, emission: 350–600 nm). Typical
results are shown in Figure 3. Upon binding to native TTR, 4 generated two
emission peaks at 449 and 476 nm, with a total fluorescence intensity
increase of about 6.1 times the intensity of the probe in buffer (Figure 3A). Upon binding
to fibrillar TTR, there were also two emission peaks at 451 and 475
nm; however, the dominating contribution was shifted toward the shorter
wavelength (Figure 3A). Here, the apparent increase in fluorescence intensity was 8.8-fold.
As found from our results of 3,36 the spectrum of 4 bound to fibrils was blue-shifted
compared with native TTR (Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, probe 5, upon binding to either native
or fibrillar TTR, showed very similar emission spectra with peaks
at 420, 445, and 475 nm. The difference here is the apparent fluorescence
intensity increase: 15.8-fold for native TTR compared with 6.3-fold
for fibrillar TTR (Figure 3B). These two conformational states of TTR are vastly different
as shown by us using a large collection of biophysical techniques.36 We noted intense fluorescence of 5 bound to the native tetrameric TTR. The determined Kd value for 5 binding to the high-fluorescence
site for native TTR was 0.2 ± 0.01 μM (Figure S2). The intensity increase of ThT bound to TTR fibrils
was a mere 1.8, indicating that these new probes are more sensitive
for the detection of TTR fibrils in vitro at acidic pH (pH 3.0).

TTR and (B) 5, upon binding to either native or fibrillar
TTR. [native TTR] = [TTR fibrils] = 5 μM (on a monomer basis),
[probe] = 1 μM, excitation wavelength: 330 nm. Identical settings
were used in all measurements.

We further investigated the titration of TTR fibrils on a
fixed
concentration of probe (1.0 μM) to determine the Kd values for the whole series. As found previously with 1 and 3, two separate binding events were detected: 1 (Kd1 = 0.11 μM and Kd2 > 10 μM) and 3 (Kd1 = 0.07 μM and Kd2 > 10 μM).36 The high-affinity
binding site showed minor fluorescence contribution; hence, we herein
for fluorescence discrimination compare all probes for the high-fluorescence
binding site. The Kd values were 15.1
μM for 2, 12.3 μM for 3, 7.4
μM for 4, and 6.0 μM for 5,
indicating that the affinity was in the following order: 5 > 4 > 3 > 2, for
details

S3–S6 in the Supporting Information.

--- no apparent peak.

We
also experimentally addressed the finding of nearly identical
spectra for compound 5 when bound to protofibrillar and
native tetrameric TTR. Although the fluorescence intensity correlates
well with the high intensity found in toluene, the spectral Stokes
shift of probe 5 appears insensitive toward polarity
of the binding site using four different solvents (PBS buffer, methanol,
DMSO, and toluene) (Figure S7A). Notably,
the relative intensities of three emission peaks do change, but the
peak positions remain (Figure S7B). Our
conclusion from the observation that the probe spectra bound to TTR
are similar to that of 5 dissolved in toluene shows that
both binding sites in the different conformational states are highly
hydrophobic. Because the Kd toward native
TTR is significantly lower than that of TTR protofibrils (0.2 μM
compared with 6 μM), the occupancy of 5 on protofibrils
is lower compared with native TTR under the conditions described in Figure 3, explaining the
difference in intensity. This large Kd difference underlines the difference of a highly ordered binding
site in the tetramer (T4 binding pocket) versus a more dynamic and
fluid binding site on protofibrils.36

trans-Stilbenoids 2, 3, 4, and 5 Bind to Insulin Amyloid Fibrils
Similar experiments as discussed in the previous section were carried
out to evaluate the probe series (Chart 1) for detecting insulin fibrils and as a
control to native monomeric/dimeric insulin at pH 3.0. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2, when these probes were incubated
with native insulin, we found no significant change in fluorescence,
indicating that there were only weak interactions between the probes
and native insulin. By contrast, upon binding to insulin fibrils, 2 showed an emission peak at 382 nm and an apparent fluorescence
intensity increase (7.5-fold over free probe); 3 displayed
an emission peak at 410 nm and an apparent fluorescence intensity
increase (13.7-fold); 4 had an apparent emission peak
at 451 nm, a distinct fluorescence intensity increase (91.4-fold),
and an additional peak at 471 nm; and 5 had emission
peaks at 420, 445, and 475 nm and an obvious fluorescence intensity
increase (23.2-fold over free probe for the peak at 420 nm). An apparent
lower background fluorescence was observed from 2 to 5, especially 4 and 5 very little
fluorescence was given in either buffer, suggesting that these probes
formed aggregates or micelles in the absence of fibrils. Compared
with ThT at pH 3.0, the intensity increase upon bound to insulin fibrils
was in the following order: 4 > 5 > 3 > ThT > 2, suggesting that 3, 4, and
5 are
more sensitive probes to detect insulin fibrils in vitro at acidic
pH (pH 3.0).

Figure 4 Fluorescence emission spectra of (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 4, and (D) 5 bound to either
native insulin or insulin fibrils. [native insulin] = [insulin fibrils]
= 5 μM (on a monomer basis), [probe] = 1 μM, excitation
wavelength: 330 nm. Identical settings were used in all measurements.

To quantitatively evaluate the
binding affinities of these probes
to insulin fibrils, we measured the change in the fluorescence intensity
by titrating a fixed low concentration of probes (1.0 μM) with
insulin fibrils. All probes mainly showed one distinct binding site
with Kd = 8.0 μM for 2, 4.5 μM for 3, 3.7 μM for 4, and 2.3 μM for 5 (for details see Table 2 and Figures S8–S11 in
the Supporting Information). Groenning
et al54 have reported that the Kd value of ThT binding to insulin fibrils was
10.4 μM with one binding site. Therefore, the affinity of insulin
fibrils to probes was in the following order: 5 > 4 > 3 >
2 > ThT.
These results indicate that the probes can specifically bind to insulin
amyloid fibrils with an obvious fluorescence intensity increase (from
7.5-fold to 91.4-fold) and moderate binding affinities.

trans-Stilbenoids 2, 3, 4, and 5 Bind to Lysozyme Amyloid Fibrils
The probe fluorescence
response toward native lysozyme and lysozyme
amyloid fibrils was assessed. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 2, there was essentially no fluorescence change of any
probe with native lysozyme. On the contrary, upon binding to lysozyme
fibrils, there is an increase in fluorescence intensity: 3.8-, 13.1-,
37.5-, and 8.9-fold for 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, as compared to the free probe.
The emission spectra recorded for each probe upon binding to lysozyme
fibrils were similar to those recorded upon binding to insulin fibrils,
which means that the emission spectra for each probe occur from the
same excited state. We also measured the Kd values: 7.0 μM for 2, 2.9 μM for 3, 2.8 μM for 4, and 1.6 μM for 5 (for details see Table 2 and Figures S12–S15 in the Supporting Information). Sulatskaya et al.55 reported that ThT binds to lysozyme fibrils with two binding
sites: Kd1 = 0.13 μM and Kd2 = 17.86 μM, which suggested that the
affinity of lysozyme fibrils to probes was in the order: 5 > 4
≈
3 > 2 > ThT (Kd2 = 17.86 μM).
The
fluorescence intensity was found to increase for probes 2, 4, and 5 but not to the same extent during
binding to lysozyme fibrils as found for insulin fibrils. Probe 3 increased similarly (13.7-fold for insulin fibrils and 13.1-fold
for lysozyme fibrils) for both fibril systems. Conclusively, these
probes can specifically bind to lysozyme fibrils concomitant with
the fluorescence intensity increase and overall with a higher affinity
than that found for insulin fibrils.

trans-Stilbenoids 2, 3, 4, and 5 Bind
to Aβ1-42 Amyloid
Fibrils
After specific detection of TTR, insulin, and lysozyme
amyloid fibrils by these probes, we further extended the use of the
series of probes in identifying Aβ1-42 amyloid fibrils at neutral
pH (pH 7.5). As shown in Figure 6, 2 binds to Aβ1-42 fibrils emitting
fluorescence with a wavelength maximum at 384 nm and a 2.6-fold fluorescence
intensity increase. 3 showed a 6.9-fold increased fluorescence
intensity, at an emission maximum at 408 nm. 4 and 5, both bind to Aβ1-42 fibrils with an apparent 10.3-
and 11.1-fold fluorescence intensity increase and emission maxima
at around 450 and 421 nm, respectively. Neither 2, 4, or 5 fluoresced appreciably in the presence
of freshly prepared native Aβ1-42, whereas 3 showed
some binding to fresh Aβ1-42 (Figure 6B). The measured binding constant to Aβ1-42
fibrils is summarized in Table 2 and Figures S14–S17 in the Supporting Information. The affinity for Aβ1-42 fibrils was stronger
for 2 (Kd = 4.3 μM), 3 (Kd = 2.2 μM), 4 (Kd = 1.6 μM), and 5 (Kd = 1.3 μM), compared with TTR,
insulin, and lysozyme fibrils. The stronger binding affinities to
Aβ1-42 fibrils (performed at pH 7.5) compared with the other
fibril types could indicate higher affinity at this pH. Furthermore,
it was found that the increase in the fluorescence intensity of 2, 3, and 4 bound to Aβ1-42
fibrils was lower than that detected for insulin and lysozyme fibrils.
Conclusively, all of the probes can specifically bind to Aβ1-42
fibrils, followed by an increase in the fluorescence intensity (from
2.6-fold to 11.1-fold compared to the free probe) and with higher
affinity compared with TTR, insulin, and lysozyme fibrils. For Aβ1-42
fibrils, the ThT fluorescence increase (36.9-fold) is even higher
than that for 5 mainly because ThT is almost completely
quenched in the free state. Various Kd values for ThT have been reported toward Aβ fibrils in the
2–30 μM range.26,50

The majority
of data in our study was collected on recombinant Aβ1-42 with
an extra methionine in the N-terminus (AβM1-42). The extra methionine
has been reported not to influence kinetics or fibril morphology48 compared with the wild-type Aβ1-42. Importantly,
two high-resolution structures were recently published where one used
this construct56 and the other study used
a construct lacking the N-terminal methionine.57 Both fibril structures were found to be nearly identical.
To verify this similar structure for our probe spectra, we prepared
fibrils for both types. Nearly identical spectral profiles were observed
(Figure 6).

(Aβ M1-42). Concentrations: [native Aβ1-42] = [Aβ1-42
fibrils] = 5 μM (on a monomer basis), [probe] = 1 μM,
excitation wavelength: 330 nm. Identical settings were used in all
measurements.

Fluorescence Lifetimes
of trans-Stilbenoids 2, 3, 4, and 5
The probes can specifically
bind to four different amyloid fibrils,
with a substantial fluorescence intensity increase and similar emission
maxima for each fibril type. No appreciable binding was detected for
native insulin, lysozyme, and Aβ1-42. Only native TTR showed
probe binding as expected from previous data, likely reflecting binding
to the T4 binding site.36 Herein, we chose
Aβ1-42 fibrils as model fibrils to investigate the emission
properties of the probes bound to amyloid fibrils from the viewpoint
of the probe structures and the interaction modes between the probes
and fibrils. We conducted time-resolved fluorescence measurements
using the TCSPC method. The probes showed very weak and quenched fluorescence
when dissolved without amyloid using the water-based buffers applied
for the amyloid or protein association experiments. A prerequisite
for the assessment of fluorescence lifetimes is to have sufficient
signal. Therefore, the intrinsic free lifetimes of the probes were
determined using degassed methanol. In methanol, the solubility is
high and by removing solvent oxygen, the parasitic quenching by oxygen,
being important especially for probes with long lifetimes, was removed. Figure 7A shows the decay
curves of the probes dissolved in methanol, in which oxygen from air
has been removed by flushing the sample with an argon gas. Thus, in
degassed methanol solution, where emission strictly occurs from the
free dyes, the fluorescence decay of the excited states of 2 is very fast (<0.05 ns). The fluorescence decay of 3 and 4 is single exponential with decay times of 0.52
and 4.23 ns, respectively. The emission decay at 415 nm for 5 is double exponential in character with the τavg = 19.11 ns (τ1 = 11.00 ns and τ2 = 29.30 ns, with the corresponding pre-exponential factors
α1 = 0.77 and α2 = 0.23, respectively)
(Table 3). As expected
for a pyrene fluorophore, probe 5 shows the longest lifetime.
Consequently, the fluorescence lifetimes of the probes in degassed
methanol are in the following order: 2 < < 3 < 4 < 5, indicating that
the different aromatic rings (benzene, naphthyl, antracene, and pyrene)
conjugated to the stilbene are promoting extended excited-state lifetimes.

To obtain sufficient
signal to noise and to work under saturated
conditions for the bound probe, the fluorescence decays for the probes
bound to Aβ1-42 fibrils were investigated under the following
conditions: [probe] = 5 μM, [Aβ1-42 fibrils] = 20 μM
(on a monomer basis), and PBS buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. By the
law of mass action and the determined Kd values of the probes bound to Aβ1-42 fibrils applied at a
10-fold concentration above the Kd for 3, 4, and 5, we expect >90% of
the
signal to originate from the fibril-bound probe. Figure 7B shows the decay curves of
the probes bound to Aβ1-42 fibrils. In general, there are small
changes in the decay upon binding, but one can note a more pronounced
contribution from longer decay time components, generating a “bent”,
multicomponent decay in all cases. Specifically, the fluorescence
decay curves for 2, 3, and 4 are successfully analyzed using the double-exponential kinetic law
with good χ2 values, whereas a three-component decay
is needed to accurately reproduce the decay of 5 with
fibrils (see details in Table 3). Multiexponential decays can arise from populations of different
binding sites in the aggregated protein, thus giving different lifetimes
due to nearby quenching amino acid residues and/or solvent water.
Multiexponential decays can also arise from mechanisms such as fluorescence
resonance energy transfer, dynamic or static collision quenching,
or combinations thereof, each model requiring a thorough analysis
and definition of the averaging procedure.58−60 To compare
the different probes side-by-side, the multiexponential decays were
summarized as intensity averaged lifetimes (see Experimental
Section, Table 3). The average lifetime reflects the state population of each contributing
lifetime, which we assume to best describe the binding sites on the
amyloid fibril. The associated time constants are presented with the
shortest first and the longest last (Table 3). As can be seen in Table 3, each probe, when bound to Aβ1-42
fibrils, showed a longer average lifetime than for the free probe
in degassed methanol. For 2, 3, and 4, the existence of a long lifetime component (τ2) population resulted from the probe incubated with Aβ1-42
fibrils; the origin of a short phase (τ1) can possibly
be attributed to the small fraction of the free probe unbound to Aβ1-42
fibrils. Another possible origin of the short phase is the light-scattering
effect from fibrils in PBS solution, although a spectral filter was
used in the setup to minimize the effect of scatter from the excitation
wavelength. For 5, the lifetime component τ3 most likely resulted from the probe bound to Aβ1-42
fibrils. The pre-exponential factors (amplitude weights) of the multicomponent
decays also show some systematic patterns. For 2, the
pre-exponential factors of τ1 are found to be larger
than that of τ2, indicating that the shorter decay
of the free probe is predominant in the excited state. For 3, the pre-exponential factors of τ1 and τ2 are almost the same, meaning that the free probe and bound
probe are nearly equal in the excited state. For 4, the
pre-exponential factors of τ1 are smaller than that
of τ2, demonstrating that the bound probe is predominant
in the excited state. Conclusively, the binding of the series of new
probes to Aβ1-42 amyloid fibrils results in a fluorescent decay
time that is substantially longer than the corresponding lifetime
found in a good solvent (methanol).

Conclusions
Inspired
by previous probe developments for TTR conformational
states,36 we have herein successfully synthesized
two new trans-stilbene-based fluorescent molecules 4 and 5 that can bind to both native and protofibrillar
TTR. Both probes become highly fluorescent in the bound state. The
amyloid-binding propensity for the series of four analogous trans-stilbenoids (two previously reported: 2 and 3, two new: 4 and 5)
with different aromatic ring moieties was compared. Because of the
common overall fold and core structure of amyloid fibrils, we expected
these probes to bind to several amyloid fibrils while being refractive
to native monomeric protein conformations. Importantly, all studied
probes can bind specifically to amyloid fibrils of vastly heterologous
proteins (insulin, lysozyme, TTR, and Aβ1-42 fibrils) with apparent
fluorescence intensity augmentation and moderate affinities. The assays
of fibrils were performed at the preferred pH for formation and stability,
that is, pH 3.0 for insulin, lysozyme, and TTR and at pH 7.5 for Aβ1-42.
To exemplify the binding response of the probes versus various amyloid
fibrils, Figure 8A
shows the fluorescence response of 5 versus various amyloid
fibril concentrations at a fixed concentration of probe. A corresponding
probe comparison for 2–5 is shown for Aβ1-42
fibrils (Figure 8B).
Both datasets display the various fluorescence responses being both
protein- and probe-dependent.

The fluorescence lifetime of ThT is rather short: 80% is
<1
ns and 20% 3.9 ns.29 One specific aim of
the current study was to develop long lifetime fluorescent probes
to allow measurements of solution dynamics of amyloid species. To
our knowledge, no small-molecule amyloid targeting probes have been
reported with pyrene or anthracene directly binding to the amyloid
fibril binding sites. In previous work, we have shown the virtue of
pyrene-based cysteine-specific probes covalently linked to TTR for
size determination of TTR oligomers up to 20 mers,61 and we hypothesized on the applicability of extended lifetime
noncovalent amyloid targeting probes described herein.17 The fluorescence lifetimes of the amyloid probes
described in this work in degassed methanol are ranked as (2 < 0.05 ns) < 3 = 0.52 ns < 4 =
4.23 ns < 5 = 19.11 ns, indicating that the different
aromatic ring moieties determine the respective probe residence time
in the excited state. When bound to Aβ1-42 fibrils, the lifetimes
are 1.3 ns (2), 1.5 ns (3), 5.7 ns (4), and 29.8 ns (5). Hence, each probe bound
to Aβ1-42 fibrils showed longer lifetime than in degassed methanol,
suggesting that the probe binding sites are hydrophobic and well-shielded
from the surrounding water solvent. Obviously, the pyrene-based 5 showed the longest fluorescence lifetime when bound to Aβ1-42
fibrils, opening the opportunity for size determination of the oligomerization
process by dynamic fluorescence spectroscopy. To make a palpable overall
comparison of the probes against various amyloid fibrils, we generated
a starplot (Figure 9A) to compare various Kd values and fluorescence
increase for the respective probe. This graphical representation illustrates
that 4 shows the strongest fluorescence increase for
fibrils at acidic pH and that the affinity (low Kd) generally increases as the hydrophobicity of the probe
increases, with the strongest binding for 5. Furthermore,
a starplot representation of the photophysical properties, Stokes
shift, and fluorescence lifetimes clearly display a similar separation
with highest Stokes shift for 4 and the longest fluorescence
lifetimes for 5 (Figure 9B). We foresee that this class of probes will be useful
for amyloid fibril research.

parameters in graphical
