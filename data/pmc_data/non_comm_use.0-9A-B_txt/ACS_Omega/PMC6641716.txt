This study describes
a new strategy to fabricate a special magnetic
catalyst via facile coating Au–Pd nanoalloy catalysts onto
a commercial magnetic stirring bar, without the incorporation of iron
element. First, the abundant natural “waste” lignin
was utilized as the reducing and stabilizing agent to prepare Au–Pd
nanoalloys in a green manner. The Au–Pd nanoalloys were assumed
to have a core–shell structure with an Au-rich core and a Pd-rich
shell. The Au–Pd nanoalloys could be well dispersed in aqueous
medium due to the stabilizing effect of lignin and be conveniently
coated onto the surface of a commercial stirring bar. The Au1.0Pd1.0 nanoalloy catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic
activities in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-amnophenol by NaBH4, with a rate constant (k) of 0.239 min–1, which was higher than that of Au0.5Pd1.0 and Au2.0Pd1.0 nanoalloys and 4 times
higher than that of a single-component Au or Pd nanoparticles. Besides,
the catalytic ability of Au–Pd nanoalloy catalyst could be
maintained even after seven cycles of catalysis. The catalytic rate
constant was found to be positively correlated to the stirring speed
of the bar. The scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed ravines
and pores on the surface of lignin–nanoalloys composites, implying
the possible mechanism of the catalytic activities. This study not
only proved the feasibility of lignin for green synthesis of Au–Pd
nanoalloys but also proposed a facile and innovated strategy for the
future production of solid/liquid catalytic platforms where the developed
method could be used to coat any surface interfacing the reagents.

Introduction
For catalysts, efficient
recovery is one of the most important
and challenging characteristics, leading to an explosion of interest
in those that are easily recoverable. Supported catalysts and magnetic
catalysts are the two main solutions for such a purpose. For example,
efforts have been made to immobilize the catalysts onto films, ceramics,
or carbons,1−3 but they generally involve complicated fabrication
procedures; magnetic components have been incorporated directly into
the catalysts,4,5 but the recovery of magnetic catalysts
typically in the powder form is still time-consuming. Therefore, a
breakthrough in the fabrication strategy for facile and easily recoverable
catalysts is in great demand.

Furthermore, heterogeneous catalysts
based on metal nanoparticles
(NPs) have played a fundamental role for decades due to their remarkable
activities toward various essential reactions.6 Moreover, alloying two metals into single particles, that is, manufacturing
of nanoalloys is now pushing forward the development of catalysis
because nanoalloy catalysts usually exhibit enhanced catalytic performance,
selectivity, and stability due to the synergistic effects.7

Among various techniques for the preparation
of nanoalloys, toxic
reducing agents as well as additional stabilizers (such as polymers
or surfactants) are often needed.8 More
recent with green chemistry, certain natural products such as leaf
extracts and fruit juice were employed for the green synthesis of
nanoalloys.9,10 However, these products require
intentional extraction for large-scale usage. To avoid unnecessary
extraction and the accompanied cost, it would be a better choice to
adopt a more abundant natural “waste” as the green reducing
and stabilizing agent. Lignin, the second most abundant natural polymer,
which is the massive byproduct of the paper industry, turned out to
be an ideal candidate for a low-cost and green synthesis of size-controlled
and well-dispersed monometallic nanoparticles.11

In the present study, we further identified the feasibility
of
lignin for the synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles, that is, Au–Pd
nanoalloys. The lignin-reduced Au–Pd nanoalloys were facilely
coated on a commercial magnetic stirring bar via a spray adhesive
to generate a novel heterogeneous catalytic platform. A common reaction
involving the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-amnophenol (4-AP)
by NaBH4 was demonstrated as a model catalytic reaction.
The procedure is illustrated in Scheme 1. The effect of Au–Pd ratio and the stirring
speed on the catalytic performance, as well as the reusability of
the catalytic stirring bar, were investigated. We finally propose
a possible working mechanism of the Au–Pd nanoalloy-coated
catalytic stirring bar.

Results and Discussion
Structure of Au–Pd Nanoalloys
The compositions
of the prepared nanoalloys were examined with the atomic absorption
spectrometer (AAS) and the results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that the Au/Pd ratios of
the metal precursors and the final products were similar, indicating
that the reaction degrees of the two reduction processes were also
similar.

precursor	final products	
samples	Au (mmol)	Pd (mmol)	Au:Pd	
Au2.0Pd1.0	1.07	0.69	1.55:1	
Au1.0Pd1.0	0.84	0.97	0.87:1

Pd NPs	0	1.58	0:100	
The UV–vis
spectra of the Au–Pd nanoalloys and the
single-component Au NPs as well as Pd NPs are shown in Figure 1a. In the first step, the reddish
solution of the Au NPs reduced by lignin showed a characteristic absorption
band at approximately 530 nm, which could be ascribed to the surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) of the Au NPs.12 In accord with the previous study,13 the
Pd NPs did not show pronounced SPR bands in the UV–vis region.
For the three kinds of Au–Pd nanoalloys, it could be observed
that the absorbance of the Au NPs SPR band was weakened. In addition,
with a higher percentage of Pd, the SPR band became less visible.
Therefore, the decrease in the SPR band intensity provided an evidence
for the formation of the nanoalloys.14,15

spectra of Au–Pd nanoalloys, with the
band at 530 nm indicating the formation of Au NPs and the decreasing
intensity indicating the nanoalloy formation. (b) X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of Au–Pd nanoalloys. The (111) reflection peak
shifts from Au to Pd indicates the formation of the nanoalloy. (c)
High-resolution Pd 3d X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra
of the nanoalloys and (d) high-resolution Au 4f XPS spectra of the
nanoalloys. The two peaks (at 338.00 and 343.30 eV) corresponding
to PdII in the nanoalloy indicates the positively charged
Pd with Au as the electronic promoter.

XRD can help distinguish the structure of Au–Pd NPs
because
the diffraction peaks can predict the relationship between the crystal
lattice parameter.16 The XRD patterns of
the Au–Pd nanoalloys are shown in Figure 1b, with the patterns of the single-constituent
Au NPs and Pd NPs as controls. For Au NPs, there were five reflection
peaks at 2θ = 38.2, 44.4, 64.6, 77.6, and 81.7°, corresponding
to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) facets, respectively.
The pattern of Pd NPs showed four reflection peaks at 2θ = 39.6,
45.5, 67.3, and 80.0°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220),
and (311) facets, respectively. For the alloy structure, the Au and
Pd atoms are mixed, and the diffraction peak for the (111) plane should
appear between 38.2 and 39.6°.17 In
our fabricated Au−Pd NPs, the (111) diffraction peaks were
all located at 2θ = 38.2°, matching that of the Au NPs,
and the same with the (200), (220) , and (311) planes. These data
indicate that the Au–Pd NPs might have assumed a core–shell
structure, with Au atoms in the core and a Pd-enriched shell, which
is in accordance with the previous reports.18

XPS has been used to determine the surface elemental compositions
of the samples. Figure 1c,d illustrates the Pd 3d and Au 4f XPS spectra of the Au–Pd
nanoalloys. The binding energies (BEs) of the XPS spectra were calibrated
with reference to C 1s at 284.80 eV. In Figure 1c, it can be observed that Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 signals appeared at the binding energies
(BEs) of 335.80 and 340.90 eV, respectively, suggesting the presence
of metallic Pd0 in each sample.17 With the increasing Pd percentage, the intensity of Pd signals became
stronger. It is worth noting that the two peaks at 338.00 and 343.30
eV corresponding to PdII were also present in the nanoalloys
samples, indicating the increasing positively charged Pd in the nanoalloys,
which might be attributed to Au acting as an electronic promoter for
Pd.18,19Figure 1d illustrates the Au 4f XPS spectra of the nanoalloys
samples, presenting the peaks at ∼83.60 and ∼87.30 eV,
respectively, which could be assigned to Au 4f7/2 and Au
4f5/2 spin–orbit states of the zero-valent Au.20 The Au0 4f peaks showed a slight
shift but similar BEs when Pd was incorporated into the nanoalloy.

The structural change of lignin during the redox process is illustrated
by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra in Figure S1. The spectra of lignin before (spectrum a) and after
the reaction (spectra b–d) were similar. The band at 3320 cm–1 ascribed to O–H stretching of lignin after
the reaction (spectra b–d) was weakened and shifted to lower
wavenumbers (3190 cm–1), indicating the decrease
in hydroxyl groups within lignin and an interaction between the two
metallic counterparts. In spectrum a, there is a 1706 cm–1 band belonging to the unconjugated C=O stretching of ester
in raw lignin, whereas the 1603 cm–1 band was the
aromatic skeletal vibration related to the C=O stretching.21 After the reaction, the unconjugated C=O
units of ester were oxidized by metal salt and transformed to carboxylate
ion (COO–), resulting in the disappearance of the
1706 and 1603 cm–1 bands, and the occurrence of
the 1580 cm–1 band.22 It is noted that in the spectra b–d, there was diminishing
of the band at 1220 cm–1 corresponding to the phenolic
hydroxyl stretching of lignin, implying that some units of the lignin
framework reacted or dropped out during the formation of the nanoalloys.23 In summary, the reduction in the intensity of
O–H and the oxidation of the unconjugated C=O to COO– implied that O–H and C=O units within
the lignin structure may have contributed to the reduction of metal
salt to nanoalloys.

Morphology of Au–Pd Nanoalloys
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) are particularly
useful to obtain information of the morphology as well as the angstrom
level of the nanoalloys.24Figure 2a demonstrates the morphology
of Au1.0Pd1.0 nanoalloys, which were well dispersed
in water due to the stabilization effect of lignin. The size of the
nanoalloys ranged from 20 to 50 nm, and the irregular shapes of the
nanoalloys might be caused by the utilization of amorphous biopolymer
as the reducing agent and an uncritical synthesis condition. In the
HRTEM image of Au–Pd NPs (Figure 2b), the dark interiors were the Au-rich cores
and the lighter entities on the peripheries were Pd-rich shells. The
clear contrast between the Au cores and the Pd shells indicated the
core–shell structure of the Au–Pd NPs, which is in accordance
with the literature.24 In addition, the
overlay of Pd and Au energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) maps (Figure 2c–e) verified
the core–shell structure with Au cores embraced by Pd shells.

structure.

Catalytic Activity of Stirring
Bar-Supported Au–Pd Nanoalloy
Catalyst
4-NP is a common organic pollutant in waste water,
and its removal is an important issue. In addition, 4-AP is a potent
intermediate for the manufacture of many analgesic/antipyretic drugs
and photographic developers. Therefore, ways that efficiently reduce
4-NP to 4-AP have great impact on both environment and industry.25 In this study, the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP
by NaBH4 was used as a model system to quantitatively evaluate
the catalytic activity of the fabricated Au–Pd nanoalloys catalytic
magnetic stirring bars. Figure 3a shows a characteristic absorption band of 4-NP at ∼400
nm in the UV–vis spectra, which is proportional to the concentration
of 4-NP during the catalytic reaction.26 It can be seen that the band of 4-NP around 400 nm gradually diminished
along with the reaction time and a new band at ∼300 nm ascribed
to 4-AP gradually rose, indicating the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP by
NaBH4 in the presence of the catalytic stirring bar. Comparing
Pd NPs and Au NPs with nanoalloys (Figures 3a–c and S2), Au1.0Pd1.0 nanoalloys presented the best
catalytic activity. After being catalyzed by Au1.0Pd1.0 nanoalloys for 16 min, 4-NP was almost entirely converted
into 4-AP, as shown in Figure 3a. The relationships between the rate constant and the time
can be calculated by eq 1(27) 1  This formula
indicates that the rate constant
(k) is determined by the linear relationship between
the reaction time and ln(Ct/C0), which is proportional to the ln(At/A0). In eq 1, Ct represents
the concentration of 4-NP at time t and C0 is the original concentration of 4-NP; At refers to the absorbance value at 400 nm at time t and A0 is the absorbance value
at t = 0.

Figure 3 Time-dependent UV–vis spectra showing
the reduction of 4-NP
by NaBH4 in the presence of (a) Au1.0Pd1.0, (b) Au0.5Pd1.0, and (c) Au2.0Pd1.0 nanoalloys-coated catalytic stirring bar. (d) Plot
of −ln(Ct/C0) against the reaction time. Au1.0Pd1.0 nanoalloys showed the best catalytic activity due to shortest catalytic
time. The rate constant of Au1.0Pd1.0 was 0.239
min–1. (e) The influence of stirring speed on the
rate constant. (f) The reusability performance of Au1.0Pd1.0 nanoalloys-coated catalytic stirring bar. The Au–Pd
nanoalloy catalyst still exhibited excellent reusability after seven
cycles.

Thus, the rate constant (k) of the five catalysts
were calculated to be Au1.0Pd1.0 = 0.239 min–1, Au0.5Pd1.0 = 0.119 min–1, Au2.0Pd1.0 = 0.092 min–1, Pd NPs = 0.072 min–1, and Au NPs
= 0.068 min–1. The corresponding data are also illustrated
in Figure 3d. These
results implied that the Au–Pd core–shell nanoalloys
possessed enhanced catalytic efficiency relative to their monometallic
counterparts in such a catalytic reaction, which is in agreement with
the previous studies.28,29 Concerning the similar size distribution
of the three Au–Pd NPs (Figure S3), Au1.0Pd1.0 performed better than Au0.5Pd1.0 and Au2.0Pd1.0, which
might be attributed to a better “synergistic effect”
when the molar ratios of the two components are similar.30

Additionally, the effect of stirring speed
on the catalytic activity
was also studied, and the results are shown in Figure 3e. When the catalytic stirring bar was static
in the mixed solution of 4-NP and NaBH4, the reduction
reaction proceeded slowly, with a low rate constant (k) of approximately 0.013 min–1. With increasing
stirring speed, the catalytic stirring bar exhibited enhanced catalytic
activities, which could be ascribed to an improved “mass transfer”
due to more frequent contact of the reactants and the Au–Pd
nanoalloys on the surface of the stirring bar under higher stirring
speeds.31

The feasibility and reusability
are two important properties for
a good catalyst. The reusability of our developed catalytic stirring
bar was thus also evaluated. As shown in Figure 3f, the Au–Pd nanoalloys catalysts
exhibited similar catalytic performance without an obvious decrease
in the rate constant (k) over seven consecutive experiments,
which might be attributed to the stabilization effect of the lignin
matrix on the nanoalloys and the protection of the spray adhesive.
After reaction, the stirring bar coated with Au–Pd nanoalloys
catalyst could be easily recycled from the reaction vessel and cleaned
with water for the next cycle.

The fabricated Au–Pd nanoalloys-coated
catalytic stirring
bar showed a nearly black gross appearance, which was the natural
color of the lignin-synthesized Au–Pd nanoalloys (inset in Figure 4a1). To further investigate
the surface texture of the fabricated catalytic stirring bar and the
structural changes after catalysis, the SEM images were taken, as
shown in Figure 4.
From Figure 4a1, it
can be seen that the surface of the stirring bar is rough and covered
potentially by the mixture of spray adhesive and lignin–nanoalloys
composites. The surface was filled with microscopic ravines and pores
due to vigorous stirring during the fabrication process. After several
cycles of catalysis, the microscopic surface became less rough (Figure 4a2,a3, which might
be explained by the external swollen lignin). In spite of this observation,
the ravines and pores still remained within the structure, maintaining
a large specific surface area for mass diffusion and transport and
therefore high efficiency of the heterogeneous catalysis.32 From the higher-magnification images at nanoscale
in Figure 4b, the surface
of lignin–nanoalloys layer before catalysis was relatively
smooth, with small nodules expected to be the Au–Pd nanoalloys
(seen in Figure 4b1).
After catalysis for several cycles, the surface became rougher, exposing
more internal Au–Pd nanoalloys (Figure 4b2,b3).

Figure 4 SEM images showing the surface of the
Au–Pd nanoalloys-coated
catalytic stirring bar at (a) lower magnification and (b) higher magnification:
(1) uncatalyzed; (2) catalyzed for two cycles; and (3) catalyzed for
seven cycles. The inset in (a1) shows the photograph of a fabricated
Au–Pd nanoalloys-coated catalytic stirring bar. After catalysis,
the rough surface of lignin–nanoalloy became smooth due to
external swelled-up lignin (in lower magnification) and the surface
of lignin–nanoalloy layer became rougher as more internal Au–Pd
nanoalloys became exposed (in higher magnification).

Based on the above analyses, the mechanism for
Au–Pd nanoalloys-coated
catalytic stirring bar to catalyze the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP by
NaBH4 can be explained by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
model,33 which is illustrated in Scheme 2. Under magnetic
stirring, the substrates 4-NP and the reducing agents BH4– diffused into the ravines and pores of the lignin–nanoalloy
structures quickly and came in contact with the catalyst frequently.
Compared with the single-component Au NPs or Pd NPs, the electrons
could transfer more easily from the negatively charged BH4– to the partial surface of the positively charged
Au–Pd nanoalloys (based on the XPS analysis), which was regarded
as the synergistic effect of Au and Pd.34 Subsequently, the electrons were delivered to 4-NP and the latter
was converted to 4-AP and left the surface due to the convection generated
during stirring, enabling continuous catalysis. After several catalysis
cycles, the surface of the catalytic stirring bar became rougher,
but the ravines and pores were retained due to the three-dimensional
framework of the coated lignin, where the Au–Pd nanoalloys
were also protected by the stabilization effect of lignin, resulting
in the preserved catalytic efficiency of the catalytic stirring bar
over multiple cycles of reactions.

Reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP by
NaBH4 in the Presence of the Au–Pd Nanoalloys-Coated
Catalytic Stirring Bar
Under stirring, 4-NP
and BH4– came in contact with catalyst
quickly.
Electrons could transfer from BH4– to
the positively charged Au–Pd nanoalloys and then 4-NP was reduced
to 4-AP.

Conclusions
In
summary, a novel and facile strategy was developed to fabricate
the special magnetic catalyst, using Au–Pd nanoalloys as active
ingredients, which were directly attached to the surface of a commercial
magnetic stirring bar. The Au–Pd nanoalloys synthesized by
lignin as the reducing and stabilizing agent exhibited a core–shell
structure, with Au NPs as the core surrounded by the Pd shell. The
prepared nanoalloys were coated onto the surface of a stirring bar
with the aid of a commercial spray adhesive. The catalytic performance
of the fabricated Au–Pd nanoalloys-coated catalytic stirring
bar was validated by the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP by NaBH4, demonstrating an excellent catalytic activity compared with the
single-component nanoparticles as catalysts. Our study not only proved
the feasibility of biomass residuals lignin for the green synthesis
of nanoalloys but also provided a novel and useful strategy for the
fabrication of solid/liquid catalytic platforms. Although the magnetic
stirring bar was used as a proof-of-concept example, we expect convenient
extension of this approach to many other solid surfaces for future
applications.

Experimental Section
Materials and Apparatus
Lignin was recovered from soda
pulping effluent of the State Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper Engineering
(Guangzhou, China). Diammine dichloropalladium(II) (Pd(NH3)2Cl2) and gold(III) chloride hydrate (HAuCl4·xH2O) were supplied by Shanghai
Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). A Super 77 spray
adhesive was obtained from 3M (Minneapolis). All of the other chemical
reagents and solvents were of analytical grade.

An XH-100A microwave
synthesis system was purchased from Beijing XiangHu Science and Technology
Department Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The reaction was performed
inside the system under pulsed microwave irradiation at atmospheric
pressure.

Green Synthesis of Lignin–Au–Pd Composites
The synthesis of Au–Pd nanoalloys was conducted in lignin
aqueous solution via a successive reduction process. Briefly, 2% lignin
solution was prepared by dissolving lignin in 1% aqueous NaOH. Lignin
solution was added in a certain volume of HAuCl4 solution
(40 mg/mL) at the solid mass ratio of 1:1, and the mixture was reacted
under microwave irradiation (800 W, 80 °C) for 60 min for the
formation of Au NPs. A certain amount of Pd(NH3)2Cl2 was dissolved in 1% NaOH and then added into the above
purple Au NPs solution, followed by the addition of extra 2% lignin
solution (the mass ratio of Pd salt to lignin was 1:1) for the second
step of reduction. After microwave irradiation for another 60 min
at 90 °C, the resultant black solution was dialyzed against ultrapure
water and the solid product was obtained after lyophilization at −40
°C. The products were denoted as Au2.0Pd1.0, Au1.0Pd1.0, and Au0.5Pd1.0, respectively, corresponding to the different feeding Au/Pd molar
ratios. The single-component Au NPs or Pd NPs were also prepared as
controls.

Fabrication of Au–Pd Nanoalloys-Coated Catalytic Magnetic
Stirring Bar
For the facile fabrication of a novel catalytic
magnetic stirring bar, a certain amount of Au–Pd nanoalloy
a solid product was placed in a beaker onto an on-state magnetic stirring
apparatus. A commercial magnetic stirring bar coated with fresh spray
adhesive was place in the above container and stirred for a few seconds
until agglutination. The stirring bar coated with Au–Pd nanoalloys
was washed with ultrapure water for several times to remove the unbound
solid and then dried in ambient conditions.

Characterization
The UV–vis spectra of the Au–Pd
nanoalloys in different compositions were obtained by a UV-1800 spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu, Japan), with a scan range of 300–900 nm at a scan
interval of 0.5 nm. To investigate the crystal structure of Au–Pd
nanoalloys, the X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis was performed
on a D8 Advance XRD system (Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, 50 mA) (Bruker,
Germany) and the relative intensity was recorded in the scattering
range (2θ) of 30–90°. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis of the Au–Pd nanoalloys was obtained by a Kratos
AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos, U.K.) using Mg Kα radiation (hγ = 1253.6 eV) in step size of 0.1 eV, and the core-level
data were analyzed with nonlinear fitting software (XPSPEAK 4.1).
The structures of lignin before and after reduction were identified
by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) on a Nicolet 5700 spectrophotometer
(Madison), using a spectral window of 4000–400 cm–1.

The morphology and microstructures of the Au–Pd nanoalloys
were observed by a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM;
JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The scanning transmission
electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (STEM–EDS)
maps of Pd and Au were conducted on a Bruker XFlash 5030T X-ray energy-dispersive
spectroscopy analyzer (Bruker, Germany) attached to the equipment.
A Zeiss Ultra 55 scanning electron microscope (SEM; Carl Zeiss, Germany)
was employed at 5 kV to investigate the surface morphology of the
prepared Au–Pd nanoalloys-coated catalytic magnetic stirring
bar. The Au and Pd contents of the prepared catalysts were determined
by Z-5000 atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) (Hitachi, Japan).

Heterogeneous Catalytic Activity
The catalytic activity
of the magnetic stirring bar was studied via a typical catalytic reaction,
that is, the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP in the presence of NaBH4. The aqueous solution was prepared by mixing NaBH4 (1 mL, 0.12 M) with 4-NP solution (0.5 mL, 0.005 M) and 25 mL of
water. The olive-colored solution was placed onto a magnetic stirring
apparatus, followed by the addition of the catalytic stirring bar.
At required time intervals, the reaction solution was tested with
the UV–vis spectrometer. The effect of different compositions
of the Au/Pd coating on the catalytic magnetic stirring bar and stirring
rate on the rate constant (k) were investigated.
Furthermore, the recyclability and the change in the surface morphology
of the stirring bar were also studied.
