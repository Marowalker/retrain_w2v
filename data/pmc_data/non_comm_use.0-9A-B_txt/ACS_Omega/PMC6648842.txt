Catalytic hydrothermal conversion
of carbohydrates could provide
a series of versatile valuable platform chemicals, but the formation
of solid humins greatly decreased the efficiency of the process. Herein,
by studying the hydrothermal degradation behavior and analyzing the
degradation paths of kinds of model compounds including carbohydrates,
furan compounds, cyclic ketone derivatives, and some simple short
carbon-chain oxy-organics, we demonstrate that α-carbonyl aldehydes
and α-carbonyl acids are the key primary precursors for humin
formation during the hydrothermal conversion process. Then, we analyzed
the hydrothermal degradation paths of two simple α-carbonyl
aldehydes including glyoxal and pyruvaldehyde and found that the α-carbonyl
aldehydes could undergo aldol condensation followed by acetal cyclization
and dehydration to form solid humins rich of furan ring structure
or undergo Cannizaro route (hydration followed by 1,2-hydride shift)
to form corresponding α-hydroxy acids. On the basis of the hydrothermal
behavior of the α-carbonyl aldehydes, we mapped the hydrothermal
degradation routes of carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, and xylose)
and illuminated the formation details of α-carbonyl aldehydes,
α-hydroxy acids, γ-lactones, furfural derivatives, and
humins. Finally, we deduced the typical structure fragments of humins
from three α-carbonyl aldehydes of pyruvaldehyde, 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal,
and 3-deoxyglucosone, all of which could be formed during the hydrothermal
degradation of hexose.

Introduction
Polysaccharides including
cellulose and hemicellulose are the main
components of the abundant lignocellulosic biomass; thus, the conversion
of these polysaccharides into valuable platform chemicals and liquid
fuels plays a critical role for the biorefinery process. The catalytic
hydrothermal conversion process is one efficient way to convert the
abundant biomass into value-added chemicals and liquid fuels. During
the catalytic hydrothermal conversion process, cellulose and hemicelluloses
in biomass are hydrolyzed into monosaccharides, which could be further
transformed into valuable platform chemicals such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF),1,2 furfural, levulinic acid,3,4 dihydroxyacetone,
glyceraldehydes, pyruvaldehyde, and lactic acid.5−7 Unfortunately,
kinds of coal-like black solid residue, called humins or hydrothermal
char,8−12 are formed during the hydrothermal conversion of carbohydrates,
which leads to a considerable loss of the sugar feed and strongly
decreases the efficiency of the biorefinery process.2,13,14 Therefore, studying the humin
formation mechanism is of great significance for value-added platform
chemical production via catalytic hydrothermal conversion of the abundant
lignocellulosic biomass.

Combination of the analysis methods
of elemental analysis, Fourier
transform infrared, 13C solid-state NMR, and pyrolysis–gas
chromatography (GC)–mass spectrometry, multiple research studies
have confirmed that humins are furan-rich polymer network containing
different oxygen functional groups.15−19 On the basis of the structure of humins, several
pathways of formation of humins from carbohydrates and furan compounds
have also been proposed. Sumerskii et al. proposed that etherification/acetalization
of HMF and polycondensation of furfural through electrophilic substitution
all could lead to the formation of humins.17 Dee and Bell proposed that humins are formed through the acetalization
of furfural/HMF with carbohydrates.20 Patil
et al. proposed that aldol condensation of HMF with 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal,
one kind of α-carbonyl aldehyde formed by hydrolytic ring-opening
of HMF, is the initial step for humin formation from glucose and HMF.21,22 van Zandvoort proposed that humins are formed by two main routes
of nucleophilic attack of the furan ring on the carbonyl group of
HMF and condensation reactions between HMF molecules.15 Recently, Cheng et al. proposed that aldol condensation
of carbohydrates with furfural/HMF is the key initial step for humins
formation.23 In conclusion, although advances
have been achieved, the humins formation mechanism has not yet been
unequivocally established and still needs to be deeply explored.

Here, we studied the hydrothermal degradation of 37 model compounds
including carbohydrates, furan derivatives, cyclic ketones, carboxylic
acids, and simple short-chain oxy-organics containing 2–4 carbon
atoms and found that solid humins could only be formed from these
compounds which can generate α-carbonyl aldehydes or α-carbonyl
acids during the hydrothermal degradation process. On the basis of
the discovery, we proposed that the humins are formed by aldol condensation
of the α-carbonyl aldehydes (acids), followed by acetalization
and dehydration. At last, we analyzed the decomposition paths of glucose
and confirmed that six kinds of α-carbonyl aldehydes could be
easily formed from glucose, which is responsible for the high yield
of humins formation during the hydrothermal degradation of glucose.

Results
and Discussion
Degradation Behavior of Carbohydrates and
Their Derivatives
Because the reaction temperature, reaction
time, and the concentration
of feedstock all could greatly influence the formation of humins,
we conducted all the hydrothermal degradation of all model compounds
under temperature of 493 K for 5 h, employing 0.12 mol carbon atoms
in the feedstock. Glucose, fructose, rhamnose, xylose, and dihydroxyacetone
are five representative sugars, whereas HMF, 5-methylfurfural, furfural,
and pyruvaldehyde are the dehydration products of glucose, rhamnose,
xylose, and dihydroxyacetone, respectively;24−26 so, we first
studied the hydrothermal degradation behavior of these nine chemicals.
After hydrothermal treatment at high temperature of 493 K for 5 h,
the conversions of all of these compounds have reached 100% except
for 5-methylfurfural (62%) and furfural (74%), suggesting that these
two compounds are relatively stable under hydrothermal condition compared
to other studied compounds (Table 1, entries 1–9). Glucose, fructose, and HMF yielded
over 50% of solid humins, suggesting that these three chemicals are
more favor to generate humins. On the contrary, below 25% of humins
is generated from 5-methylfurfural (12.1%) and furfural (23.4%), much
less than the other compounds (over 35%), indicating that these two
compounds are less favor to form humins. It should be noted that the
humins generated from rhamnose (35.2%) and xylose (46.4%) were higher
than that of 5-methylfurfural (12.1%) and furfural (23.4%) (entries
3,4 and entries 7,8), suggesting that rhamnose and xylose may form
humins through other routes in addition to 5-methylfurfural and furfural.
Dihydroxyacetone and pyruvaldehyde, both of which are oxygenates with
3 carbon atoms in the molecular, all could yield around 45% of solid
humins. This is the first time to report that compounds with carbon
chain of below 5 could also generate humins under hydrothermal condition.
Around 10–20% of soluble polymers and less than 20% of carboxylic
acids are also formed during the hydrothermal process, except for
pyruvaldehyde which formed 39.4% of carboxylic acid (lactic acid)
and 6.7% of soluble polymers.

Considering carboxylic acids such
as formic acid, levulinic acid,
and lactic acid all can be formed during the hydrothermal degradation
of carbohydrates,5,27,28 we further studied the hydrothermal behavior of these three carboxylic
acids (Table 1, entries
10–12). Results showed that the conversions of formic acid,
levulinic acid, and lactic acid are 19.9, 2.9, and 7.8%, respectively,
indicating that these carboxylic acids are relatively stable compared
to the carbohydrates and furfural derivatives. No solid humins are
formed from these carboxylic acids, suggesting that these carboxylic
acids are not the key intermediates for humins formation.

Hydrogenation
of glucose can form sorbitol,29 whereas
oxygenation of glucose can produce gluconic acid
and glucolactone;30,31 so we further studied the hydrothermal
behavior of sorbitol and glucolactone. Interestingly, no humins were
formed from sorbitol, and only 17.4% of humins were formed from gluconic
acid, indicating that these two compounds are disfavored to form humins
compared with glucose (Table 1, entries 13,14). It is well known that sorbitol is lack of
aldehyde group, and hydrothermal dehydration of sorbitol could hardly
forms aldehydes or ketones;32 thus, we
suspected that the aldehyde group in the glucose plays a critical
role in the formation of humins for glucose. In contrast to sorbitol,
gluconic acid can form unsaturated aldehydes and ketones under hydrothermal
conditions.3 As has been shown in Scheme 1, because of the
strong electronic absorption property of carboxylic group, gluconic
acid can undergo β-elimination and keto–enol tautomerism33−35 to form one α-carbonyl acid named 3-deoxyglucosonic acid.
Decarboxylation of α-carbonyl acids to form aldehydes is one
common reaction,36,37 so the formed 3-deoxyglucosonic
acid could further undergo decarboxylation to generate 3,4,5-trihydroxy-pentanal
(or named 2-desoxyribose), which could be further converted to 4,5-dihydroxypent-2-enal,
furfuryl alcohol, and levulinic acid (Scheme 1, path 1). On the other hand, the 3-deoxyglucosonic
acid could also undergo acetal cyclization and dehydration to generate
5-hydroxymethyl furoic acid and then further undergo decarboxylation
to form furfuryl alcohol (Scheme 1, path 2). The formed 3-deoxyglucosonic acid, 5-hydroxymethyl
furoic acid, 3,4,5-trihydroxy-pentanal, 4,5-dihydroxypent-2-enal,
and furfuryl alcohol (marked in pink in Scheme 1) all could be the precursor of humins from
gluconic acid.

Scheme 1 Proposed Paths for Gluconic Acid To Form Aldehydes
and Furfuryl Alcohol3,33−35
Degradation Behavior of Furan Compounds and
Cyclic Ketones and
the Degradation Path Analysis
Previous literatures confirmed
that humins are kinds of furan-rich polymers with aliphatic oxygenate
linkages,4,15 indicating that compounds containing furan
ring may play a critical role in the process of humins formation.

In order to analyze the role of furan ring during the formation of
humins, the hydrothermal degradation behaviors of furan derivatives
including HMF, 5-methylfurfural, furfural, furfuryl alcohol, furoic
acid, 2-acetyl furan, 2-methyl furan, and furan are compared (Table 2, entries 1–8).
The results show that HMF, 5-methylfurfural, furfural, furfuryl alcohol,
and furoic acid could produce 64.6, 12.1, 23.4, 29.2, and 11.8% of
humins, respectively, whereas no humins are formed from 2-acetyl furan,
2-methyl furan, and furan. Obviously, the humin yields from HMF and
furfuryl alcohol were higher than those from 5-methylfurfural, furfural,
and furoic acid, which could be due to that the formation of intramolecular
H-bond in HMF and furfuryl alcohol could aid the hydrolytic ring-opening
reaction of these two compounds to form primary precursors for humins
formation. The absence of humins from 2-acetyl furan, 2-methyl furan,
and furan suggests that the unsaturated furan ring is not essential
for humins formation.

Above results showed that some
furan derivatives could generate
humins, whereas some could not generate humins under hydrothermal
condition. We thought that these furan derivatives which could generate
humins must have some special functional groups or special structures
or could be converted to one kind of compounds containing some common
special functional groups or special structures. Thus, we analyzed
the degradation path of those compounds and tried to find out the
common special functional groups.

Before analyzing the degradation
path of the furan derivatives,
we should know which kinds of basic reactions could occur under the
hydrothermal condition. As has been shown above (Scheme 1), hydrolytic degradation of
gluconic acid involves the basic reactions of β-elimination,
keto–enol tautomerism, decarboxylation of α-carbonyl
aldehyde, acetal cyclization, and dehydration.3,35 It
is also well known that the conversion of HMF into levulinic acid
involves the basic steps of hydrolytic ring-opening, keto–enol
tautomerism, 1,2-hydride shift, and dehydration21 (Scheme 2, path 1), whereas the conversion of pyruvaldehyde into lactic acid
involves the basic reaction of hydration and 1,2-hydride shift.7 Besides, synthesis of cyclopentanone from furfural38−40 and synthesis of 1,2,4-benzenetriol from HMF41 all involve the basic reaction step of intramolecular aldol
condensation. Assuming that all of these basic steps could occur under
hydrothermal conditions, we then deduced the degradation paths of
these compounds with the furan ring.

Scheme 2 Paths of HMF Degradation
under Hydrothermal Conditions21,22,42−44
Scheme 2 shows the
proposed degradation paths of HMF under hydrothermal conditions. After
hydrolytic ring-opening and keto–enol tautomerism, the HMF
can yield one α-carbonyl aldehyde, named 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal,
as has been reported by Patil et al.21,22 Because of
the strong electron absorption effect of the two adjacent carbonyl
groups, the 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal is favored to undergo hydration
accompanied with 1,2-hydride shift to form one corresponding α-hydroxy
acid named 2,5,6-trihydroxyhex-3-enoic acid,42 which could be further converted to levulinic acid through the basic
steps of hydrolysis, hydration, and dehydration (Scheme 2, path 1). Besides, as the
2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal generated from HMF contains several active
α-H atoms linked on 3-C atom, 4-C atom, and 6-C atom, it can
also undergo intramolecular aldol condensation and keto–enol
tautomerism to form 1,2,4-benzenetriol (Scheme 2, path 2).43 Also
because of the strong electrophilic effect of the linked carbonyl
groups and aldehyde group, the α-H atoms linked on the β-carbon
atom of the 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal are rather active, leading
to the aldol condensation of the 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal with
other aldehydes to generate polymers.21,22 On the basis
of the above analysis, we deduced that 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal
is the key precursor during humins formation from HMF, as has been
proposed by Patil et al.21,22

By analogy with
HMF, we could also draw the degradation path of
furfural, furfuryl alcohol, furoic acid, 2-acetyl furan, and 2-methyl
furan (Schemes S1–S5). Through the
basic steps of hydrolytic ring-opening and keto–enol tautomerism,
both furfural and furfuryl alcohol could also yield corresponding
α-carbonyl aldehydes (2-oxopentanedial from furfural and 5-hydroxy-2-oxopentanal
from furfuryl alcohol) and cyclic ketones (cyclopent-3-ene-1,2-dione
from furfural and cyclopentane-1,2-dione from furfuryl alcohol) (Schemes S1 and S2). Similar to 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal
formed from HMF, the 2-oxopentanedial formed from furfural can also
undergo hydration followed by 1,2-hydride shift to yield corresponding
α-hydroxy acid named 2-hydroxy-5-oxopentanoic acid or undergo
aldol condensation followed by keto–enol tautomerism to form
cyclopentanone derivate named cyclopent-3-ene-1,2-dione. Selective
synthesis of the cyclopentanone via hydrogenation of furfural has
been reported.38,39 The path for conversion of furfuryl
alcohol into levulinic acid is similar to that of HMF, except that
furfuryl alcohol does not need to undergo the step of hydrolysis of
α-hydroxy acid44 (Scheme S2, path 3).

Different from HMF, furfural, and
furfuryl alcohol, the hydrothermal
degradation routes of furoic acid are relatively simple (Scheme S3). After hydrolytic ring-opening and
keto–enol tautomerism, furoic acid can generate one α-carbonyl
acid named 2,5-dioxopentanoic acid, which could be further converted
into furan through decarboxylation followed by cyclo-dehydration.
Therefore, 2,5-dioxopentanoic acid and furan are the two downstream
compounds during the hydrothermal degradation of furoic acid. As hydrothermal
degradation of furan could not generate humins (Table 2, entry 8), although hydrothermal degradation
of furoic acid could generate humins, we suspect that the 2,5-dioxopentanoic
acid (one α-carbonyl acid) should be the key precursor for humins
formation from furoic acid.

Both 2-acetyl furan and 2-methyl
furan all could form neither α-carbonyl
aldehydes nor α-carbonyl acids under hydrothermal condition
(Schemes S4 and S5). Hydrolytic ring-opening
of 2-acetyl furan can form one α-carbonyl ketone, whereas hydrolytic
ring-opening of methylfuran can form one γ-carbonyl aldehydes.
The α-H atoms in the α-carbonyl ketone and γ-carbonyl
aldehyde are relatively inactive compared to that in the α-carbonyl
aldehydes and α-carbonyl acids because the two ketone groups
in α-carbonyl ketone are linked to electron-donating methyl
group and methylene group, whereas the ketone group in the γ-carbonyl
aldehydes is much too weak because of the distance between them. The
low activity of α-H atoms in the α-carbonyl ketone and
γ-carbonyl aldehyde could be responsible for the absence of
humins formation during the hydrothermal conversion of 2-acetyl furan
and 2-methyl furan. It should be noted that both carbonyl group and
unsaturated furan ring are presented in the molecular of 2-acetyl
furan, indicating that these two functional groups play minor role
in humins formation.

Above analysis also showed that all of
these furan derivatives
could form cyclic ketone under hydrothermal condition. Some literatures
regard the cyclic ketone as the key precursor for humins formation.45,46 In order to clarify this viewpoint, we also studied the degradation
behavior of several cyclic ketone compounds including 2-methyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione,
1,2-cyclohexanedione, 1,3-cyclohexanedione, and 1,2,3-benzenetriol.
No solid humins were formed from these cyclic ketones under the hydrothermal
condition, although some nonvolatile chemicals are formed, suggesting
that these cyclic ketone compounds are not the key processors of humins
formation (Table 2,
entries 9–12).

According to the above results and analysis,
we could find the
following phenomena (Scheme 3): (a) HMF, furfural, and furfuryl alcohol can generate α-carbonyl
aldehydes after the step of hydrolytic ring-opening, and they all
formed relatively higher yield of solid humins during the hydrothermal
degradation process; (b) furoic acid can generate α-carbonyl
acid after hydrolytic ring-opening reaction, and it forms relatively
lower humins; and (c) both 2-acetyl furan and methylfuran could generate
neither α-carbonyl aldehyde nor α-carbonyl acid, and they
generate no humins during the hydrothermal degradation process. Thus,
we suspected that the α-carbonyl aldehydes and α-carbonyl
acids are the primary precursor of humins formation under hydrothermal
conditions. In fact, because of the strong electrophilic effect of
the aldehyde group (or carboxylic group) and the adjacent carbonyl
groups, the α-H atoms linked on the β-C atom of the α-carbonyl
aldehydes (acids) are quite active, which could cause the aldol condensation
of the α-carbonyl aldehydes (acids) with other carbonyl compounds
to generate solid humins under hydrothermal condition without any
catalyst.

Aldehydes and Humins42−44
Hydrothermal Degradation Behavior of C2–C4 Simple Chain Oxy-Organics
Glycol, acetaldehyde,
glyoxal, and glycolic acid are four simple chain oxy-organics containing
only two carbon atoms; 1,2-propylene glycol, glycerol, acetone, propanal,
pyruvaldehyde, hydroxyacetone, and pyruvic acid are simple chain oxy-organics
containing three carbon atoms, whereas n-butyl aldehyde,
acetoin, and butanedione are compounds with four carbon atoms. We
further studied the hydrothermal degradation behavior of these model
compounds and hoped to obtain valuable information for humins formation.

As shown in Table 3, among all of these simple chain oxy-organics, only glyoxal and
pyruvaldehyde, both of which are α-carbonyl aldehyde, yielded
21.7 and 44.2% of solid humins, respectively (Table 3, entry 3 and entry 8), whereas the other
oxy-organics all could not yield humins. It is well known that the
carbonyl compounds such as acetaldehyde, propanal, acetone, hydroxyacetone, n-butyl aldehyde, acetoin, and butanedione all could undergo
aldol condensation with other carbonyl compounds with the aid of catalyst.
However, none of them could yield humins under the hydrothermal condition
in this study. This could also be explained by the fact that the α-H
atoms in all of these carbonyl compounds are inactive compared to
those in the α-carbonyl aldehydes (acids), which could undergo
irreversible aldol condensation to form solid humins without any catalyst.

Hydrothermal degradation behavior
of these simply chain oxy-organics
further confirms the deduction that the α-carbonyl aldehyde
(acid) compounds are key processors to form humins.

Degradation
Paths of Glyoxal and Pyruvaldehyde
Glyoxal
and pyruvaldehyde are the most simple α-carbonyl aldehydes.
Therefore, we analyzed the hydrothermal conversion paths of these
two compounds.

As shown in Scheme 4, because of the strong electrophilic effect
of the carbonyl group linked to aldehyde group, the aldehyde group
of glyoxal could be attacked by water to form one hydrated intermediate,
which could further undergo 1,2-hydride shift reaction to form glycolic
acid, one kind of α-hydroxy acid (Scheme 4, path 1). This is the well-known Cannizaro
route.47 In fact, glyoxal can generate
about 76% glycolic acid during the hydrothermal degradation process
without any catalyst. On the other hand, also because of the strong
electrophilic effect of the two carbonyl groups, the H atom linked
on the β-C atom is quite active, making glyoxal be favored to
undergo aldol condensation to form compounds with long carbon chain,
which could further undergo intermolecular acetal cyclization and
dehydration reactions to form polymers rich of furan rings (Scheme 4, path 2). The polymer
formed by this route contains a large number of hydroxyl, carbonyl,
and C=C double bonds, which is in accord with the properties
of solid humins reported in the literatures.15,16 Therefore, we proposed that the solid residue generated by glyoxal
in the hydrothermal process is one polymer formed by aldol condensation
reaction of glyoxal, followed by acetalization and dehydration reaction.

Scheme 4 Possible Paths of Degradation and Polymerization of Glyoxal
Similar to glyoxal, pyruvaldehyde
can also yield one α-hydroxy
acid (lactic acid) through the Cannizaro route6,7,27 (Scheme 5, path 1), or yield polymers rich of furan ring structure
through the three steps of aldol condensation, acetal cyclization,
and dehydration (Scheme 5, path 2). The methyl group in pyruvaldehyde can reduce its hydration
activity, which should be responsible for the relatively lower yield
of α-hydroxy acid (40% of lactic acid) and higher humins (44.2%)
from pyruvaldehyde than that from glyoxal (76% of glycolic acid and
21.7% of solid humins).

Scheme 5 Possible Paths of Degradation and Polymerization
of Pyruvaldehyde
According to the analysis of the conversion paths of glyoxal
and
pyruvaldehyde, we conclude that the α-carbonyl aldehydes can
be digested by the following two paths under hydrothermal condition
because of the electrophilic effect of the two linked carbonyl groups:
(a) the α-carbonyl aldehydes could generate one corresponding
α-hydroxy acid through two steps of hydration and 1,2-hydride
shift (Cannizaro route) and (b) the α-carbonyl aldehydes could
undergo the aldol condensation with other carbonyl compounds to form
solid humins because of the highly active α-H atoms linked on
the β-C atoms of α-carbonyl aldehydes.

Understanding
the degradation path of α-carbonyl aldehydes
is very helpful to analyze the degradation route of carbohydrates
because α-carbonyl aldehydes could be easily formed through
β-elimination of aldose (glucose and xylose, e.g.) followed
by keto–enol tautomerism.33−35,42,48 As shown in Scheme 6, the formed α-carbonyl
aldehydes from aldose could carry on Cannizaro route to form α-hydroxy
acids, which could further undergo self-esterification to generate
γ-lactones; the formed α-carbonyl aldehydes could also
further undergo β-elimination to generate β,γ-unsaturated
α-carbonyl aldehydes and then carry on Cannizaro route to form
β,γ-unsaturated α-hydroxy acids.33,42,49−51 Besides, the α-carbonyl
aldehydes can also undergo acetal cyclization and dehydration to generate
furfural and related derivatives (HMF from glucose)52 or undergo aldol condensation to form solid humins.

Scheme 6 Possible Path of Formation of α-Carbonyl Aldehydes, α-Hydroxy
Acids, γ-Lactones, Furfural Derivatives, and Humins from Aldoses33,42,49−52
Intermediates and Byproducts Formed during the Degradation of
Glucose
Above study has confirmed that the α-carbonyl
aldehydes and α-carbonyl acids are the key primary precursors
to form humins during the hydrothermal degradation of carbohydrates.
Therefore, identifying the α-carbonyl aldehydes and α-carbonyl
acids would be helpful to understand the humins formation routes from
glucose and fructose. Hence, we mapped the degradation paths of glucose
and fructose based on the recent research progress and the hydrothermal
behavior of the α-carbonyl aldehydes (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Possible Paths of Hydrothermal Degradation
of Glucose and Fructose7,33,42,49−52
As one aldose, glucose can easily undergo β-elimination
to
form one α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, which could be further
transformed to 3-deoxyglucosone through keto–enol tautomerism.33,35,48 The 3-deoxyglucosone is one kind
of one α-carbonyl aldehyde, which could be digested via three
paths: (1) the 3-deoxyglucosone can undergo Cannizaro route to yield
one α-hydroxy acid, named 2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyhexanoic acid,42 which then undergoes self-esterification to
generate 3-deoxy-γ-hexonolactone,33 or undergoes decarboxylation, acetal cyclization, dehydration, and
rehydration to generate levulinic acid; (2) the 3-deoxyglucosone could
undergo acetal cyclization and dehydration to form HMF;52 and (3) the 3-deoxyglucosone can directly polymerize
to humins through aldol condensation followed by acetal cyclization.
The multiple by-products generated from 3-deoxyglucosone could explain
the low selectivity to HMF from glucose.2,14 On the other
hand, glucose could be transformed to fructose through 1,2-hydride
shift, which could be converted to HMF with the basic steps of acetal
cyclization, dehydration, and keto–enol tautomerism. Besides,
glucose and fructose may undergo retro-aldol reaction to generate
dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde, erythrose, and glycolaldehyde, which
could be further converted corresponding α-hydroxy acids such
as lactic acid,6,47 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid, and
2-hydroxybut-3-enoic acid and corresponding γ-lactones.53

According to the above analysis, we could
find that six kinds of
α-carbonyl aldehydes including 3-deoxyglucosone, (S)-5,6-dihydroxy-2-oxohex-3-enal, 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal, 4-hydroxy-2-oxobutanal,
2-oxobut-3-enal, and pyruvaldehyde all could be formed during the
hydrothermal degradation of glucose (marked in pink in Scheme 7), and corresponding α-hydroxy
acids including 2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyhexanoic acid, 2,5,6-trihydroxyhex-3-enoic
acid, 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid, 2-hydroxybut-3-enoic acid, and lactic
acid (marked in blue in Scheme 7) all could be formed from these α-carbonyl aldehydes
through Cannizaro reaction.

Because glucose could easily generate
α-carbonyl aldehydes
3-deoxyglucosone through the simple steps of β-elimination and
keto–enol tautomerism, whereas fructose can generate α-carbonyl
aldehyde only by the formation of glucose or HMF as intermediates,
we suspect that the formation of 3-deoxyglucosone is responsible for
the higher by-products and lower HMF yield from glucose than from
fructose.

Typical Structural Fragments of Humins Formed from HMF and 3-Deoxyglucosone
Our above analysis has proved that six kinds of α-carbonyl
aldehydes including 3-deoxyglucosone, (S)-5,6-dihydroxy-2-oxohex-3-enal,
2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal, 4-hydroxy-2-oxobutanal, 2-oxobut-3-enal,
and pyruvaldehyde all could be generated during the hydrothermal decomposition
of glucose, which all could lead to the formation of solid humins. Scheme 5 shows the typical
structural fragments of humins formed from pyruvaldehyde. Other α-carbonyl
aldehydes all could generate polymers containing similar structure
through similar manner. Here, we deduced the typical structural fragments
of humins formed from 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal and 3-deoxyglucosone.

The proposed aldol condensation paths of three 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal
molecules are shown in Scheme 8. The 3-C atom of 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal could be linked
to 1-C, 2-C, and 5-C of another 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal molecular
by aldol condensation, leading to the formation of kinds of trimers.
The structure fragments of trimer 1, trimer 3, and trimer 5 have been
included in the structure model of humins proposed by van Zandvoort
et al.,15,16 but the structure fragments of trimer 2
and trimer 4 containing parallel-ring structures are not included
in their structural model. We speculate that the parallel-ring structure
may be the kernel of humins because the parallel-ring structure is
more stable.

HMF
Scheme 9 shows the
typical structural fragments of humins formed from condensation of
three 3-deoxyglucosone molecules. The fragments of humins are also
composed of a large number of furan rings, and these structures are
also included in the humins structure model proposed by van Zandvoort
et al.15,16

Scheme 9 Proposed Typical Structural Fragments of
Humins Formed from 3-Deoxyglucosone
Explanation for High Yield of Humins from Rhamnose and Xylose
Compared to the Furfurals
In the above study, we found that
rhamnose and xylose could yield more humins than 5-methylfurfural
and furfural (Table 1, entries 3,4 and entries 7,8). This result could be explained by
regarding the α-carbonyl aldehydes as the primary precursors
of humins. As has been shown in Schemes 6 and S6, both
rhamnose and xylose could form corresponding α-carbonyl aldehydes
by simple steps of β-elimination and keto–enol tautomerism.
Therefore, rhamnose and xylose could form humins without generating
5-methylfurfural and furfural, leading to relatively higher humins
yields from rhamnose and xylose than from 5-methylfurfural and furfural.

Conclusions
Through studying the hydrothermal degradation
behavior of 37 model
compounds and analyzing the degradation paths of these model compounds,
we proved that α-carbonyl aldehydes and α-carbonyl acids
are the key primary precursors for solid humins formation during hydrothermal
degradation of carbohydrate. By analyzing the degradation path of
glucose, we found that six kinds of α-carbonyl aldehydes including
3-deoxyglucosone, (S)-5,6-dihydroxy-2-oxohex-3-enal,
2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal, 4-hydroxy-2-oxobutanal, 2-oxobut-3-enal,
and pyruvaldehyde all could be formed during the hydrothermal conversion
of glucose, which are responsible for the complex routes of glucose
degradation. Through two steps of β-elimination and keto–enol
tautomerism, glucose could be easily converted to 3-deoxyglucosone,
which could undergo Cannizaro reaction to generate corresponding α-hydroxy
acid or undergo aldol condensation to form solid humins, thus leading
to low selectivity to valuable HMF. Regarding aldol condensation,
acetal cyclization, and dehydration as three steps for humins formation,
we deduced the typical structural fragments of humins formed from
pyruvaldehyde, 2,5-dioxo-6-hydroxy-hexanal, and 3-deoxyglucosone.
Further studies on the catalytic conversion of α-carbonyl aldehydes
would be helpful to obtaining valuable chemicals from carbohydrates.

Hydrothermal Decomposition
of the Model Compounds
Model
compounds containing 0.12 mol carbon atoms and 30 mL of deionized
water were placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 493 K for
5 h to carry out the hydrothermal degradation process. After the hydrothermal
degradation process, the solid products were separated by filtering,
washed with distilled water and ethanol, and finally dried at 373
K and weighed, whereas the filtrates were evaporated and dried at
373 K to obtain the involatile products (403 K for conditions with
water as reaction media). The carbon yields of the humins were calculated
by dividing the total mass of carbon in solid residues (assuming that
the carbon content in the solid residues be 65%) by the carbon in
the feedstock, whereas the carbon yields of the involatile products
were calculated by dividing the total mass of carbon in the involatile
products (assuming that the carbon content in the involatile products
to be 60%) by the total mass of carbon in the feedstock.

Analysis of
Concentration of Model Compounds in Solvents
The concentrations
of carbohydrates and furfural derivatives were
analyzed on an Agilent 1200 series high-performance liquid chromatography
(Bio-Rad HPX-87H) with a refractive index (RI) and UV detector (210
nm), using a 5 mM aqueous sulfuric acid solution as the eluent at
a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The column and RI detector temperature
were set at 55 and 45 °C, respectively.

The concentrations
of other studied model compounds were analyzed by GC, which was performed
using an Agilent 7890B GC system equipped. The column used was a HP-5ms
Ultra Inert capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm).
The oven temperature was programmed to hold at 45 °C, ramp at
10 °C/min to 220 °C, and hold at 220 for 2 min. The flow
rate of the He carrier gas was 1.2 mL/min. Experiments were performed
in at least duplicate, and the results presented an average of two
or three measurements.
