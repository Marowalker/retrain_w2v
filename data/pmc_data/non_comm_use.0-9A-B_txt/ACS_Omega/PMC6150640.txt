Previously, we have
synthesized a diverse range of 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid (FDCA)-based semiaromatic polyamides via enzymatic polymerization.
This novel class of polymers are biobased alternatives to polyphthalamides,
which are petrol-based semiaromatic polyamides. From a commercial
perspective, they have interesting properties as high-performance
materials and engineering thermoplastics. It is even more appealing
to explore novel FDCA-based polyamides with added functionality, for
the development of sustainable functional materials. Here, a set of
FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides have been successfully produced via
Novozyme 435 (N435)-catalyzed polymerization of biobased dimethyl
2,5-furandicarboxylate with (potentially)heteroatom diamines, namely,
4,9-dioxa-1,12-dodecanediamine (DODA), diethylenetriamine, and 3,3-ethylenediiminopropylamine.
We performed the enzymatic polymerization in solution and bulk. The
latter approach is more sustainable and results in higher molecular
weight products. Among the tested heteroatom diamines, N435 shows
the highest catalytic activity toward DODA. Furthermore, we find that
all obtained FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides are amorphous materials
with a relatively high thermal stability. These heteroatom polyamides
display a glass-transition temperature ranging from 41 to 107 °C.

Introduction
Most commonly, semiaromatic
polyamides are used as high-performance
materials and engineering thermoplastics. This is owned to their good
mechanical properties, excellent chemical resistance, and other interesting
features.1,2 These polymers have many applications in
the automobile industry, electronic and electrical appliances, packaging,
photovoltaic parts and panels, medical devices, and also for materials
that are used for oil and gas extraction.

Currently, semiaromatic
polyamides are mainly produced from fossil
fuels. However, these resources are limited and are expected to be
depleted within a few centuries.3−5 Generally, semiaromatic polyamides
are obtained by polycondensation of aliphatic diamines with petrol-based
terephthalic acid (TPA) and isophthalic acid,6,7 although
the prevalent combination of aliphatic diamines and aromatic diacids
gives access to a large range of semiaromatic polyamides with diverse
properties. Using these compounds in polycondensation to obtain high-molecular-weight
products at high conversion requires extreme condition and is energy-intensive.8−11

Recent research shows that 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA)
has
been put forward as an alternative renewable building block to replace
TPA. FDCA is a rigid difunctional furan compound resembling TPA in
structure, which is likely to play an important role in the construction
of biobased polymer materials,12−15 for example, via polycondensation.14 FDCA can be directly generated by oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural,
which is easily prepared from widely available renewable C6 sugars
or polysaccharides.16,17 In addition, the production of
other heteroatom-containing chemicals from renewable resources (including
heteroatom amines) is steadily under development.18 Previously, the polymerization of diverse furanic monomers
has been reported, for example, the synthesis of furanic-aromatic
polyamides from difuranic acid chloride and various difuranic diamines.19,20 FDCA-based polymers reportedly have better or similar thermal and
mechanical properties compared to TPA-based polymers.15,21−27 Consequently, polyphthalamides (semiaromatic polyamides) can potentially
be replaced by sustainable FDCA-based polyamides.

In general,
living organisms synthesize macromolecules by in vivo
enzyme-catalyzed polymerization. Mimicking such behavior in nature
has let to in vitro enzymatic polymerization to be a well-known field,
leading to a notable interest in the production of novel and commodity
polymeric materials in a sustainable manner.28−31 Side reactions can be significantly
inhibited by using enzymatic polymerization because of the high specificity
of biocatalysts and mild reaction conditions.32 In the past decade, a vast array of polymer classes have been produced
via enzymatic polymerization, such as polysaccharides, vinyl polymers,
polyester, and polyamides. Hydrolase is among the most widely used
biocatalyst for polymer synthesis. Hydrolases such as esterases, proteases,
and lipases are popularly used in polyester synthesis. In addition,
hydrolase can also catalyze the amide bond formation, making them
good biocatalysis for polyamide synthesis. Currently, the most extensively
studied enzymes in polyamide synthesis are lipases and protease. In
our laboratory, various polyesters and polyamides are successfully
synthesized via enzymatic polymerization, including furan-based polyesters
and furan-based polyamides.7,33−36

Although the use of enzymatic polymerization is being extensively
studied, there is still a need for the further exploration of this
method to be applied in the synthesis of various novel biobased polymers
that are still not accessible via conventional methods, for example,
functional FDCA polymers. Because of the additional functionality,
new materials can be developed. Moreover, FDCA-based polymers, especially
polyamides, have not been well explored up until now, and the knowledge
of such polymers is barely based on limited studies.

The aim
of the research is, therefore, to demonstrate the use of
a bioderived furan monomer in combination with heteroatom-containing
diamines via enzymatic polymerization, to synthesize biobased polyamides
with added functionality. The resulting products will hereinafter
be referred to as FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides. We performed the
enzymatic synthesis both in solution and in bulk, and the latter approach
adds more sustainability aspects to the final products. Moreover,
we studied the thermal properties and crystallinity of these heteroatom
polyamides and investigated the difference compared to polymers synthesized
from dimethyl 2,5-furandicarboxylate (DMFDCA) with linear aliphatic
diamines.

Results and Discussion
N435-Catalyzed Polycondensation of DMFDCA
and Various Heteroatom
Diamines via Solution and Bulk Polymerization
In this work,
a series of FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides, namely, PA DODAF, PA
DETAF, and PA EDDAF, were successfully synthesized via enzymatic polymerization
(see Scheme 1). The
enzymatic polycondensation was carried out in bulk and in solution
at 90 °C using the biocatalyst N435. Biobased DMFDCA and three
heteroatom diamines were used as the monomer: 4,9-Dioxa-1,12-dodecanediamine
(DODA) with ether groups and diethylenetriamine (DETA) and 3,3-ethylenediiminopropylamine
(EDDA) having secondary amine groups. The enzymatic polymerization
results are summarized in Table 1.

Influence of Diamines on Enzymatic Polymerization
FDCA-based
heteroatom polyamides with relatively high molecular weight up to
14 900 g/mol were obtained by using DODA as a diamine monomer
(Table 1). By changing
to heteroatom diamines containing secondary amine groups (DETA and
EDDA), the enzymatic polymerization resulted in lower molecular weight
polyamides (see Figure S2). This indicated
that N435 shows better catalytic activity toward DODA compared to
that of DETA and EDDA. This result concur well with Schwab et al.,37 in which they also demonstrate that the amide
formation by Candida Antarctica lipase B (CALB) is preferable with
DODA compared to that with DETA. However, we have to take into account
the fact that reactivity of the diamines has a strong influence on
molecular weights. In general, the reactivity of amines depends on
both their basicity and nucleophilicity. The basicity increases with
the number of the electron-donating groups that are linked to the
amine functionality. The nucleophilicity is determined by several
factors such as its charge, the nature of the chemical group present
in or near the amine substituents, and the nature of the solvent used
in the reaction.38

The enzymatic
polymerization with DODA resulted in PA DODAF with the lowest isolation
yield compared to the other two. Upon changing to diamines having
secondary amine groups, the isolation yield increases to more than
∼50%. This can be explained by the higher solubility of PA
DODAF oligomers in the precipitant (THF). PA DODAF oligomers have
a higher solubility in the THF compared to PA DETAF and PA EDDAF oligomers.
During the purification steps, a higher amount of short chain oligomers
were removed, thus resulting in lower yields. Another polymerization
method or other suitable precipitants should be used to increase the
reaction yield.short chain oligomers were removed, thus resulting
in lower yields. Another polymerization method or other suitable precipitants
should be used to increase the reaction yield.

Previously in
our laboratory, different FDCA-based aromatic polyamides
(see Scheme 2a) were
successfully synthesized by using N435 as a biocatalyst.33 FDCA-based aromatic polyamides with high weight-average
molecular weight up to 48300 g mol–1 were successfully
prepared. However, in this study, the enzymatic polymerization gave
significantly lower molecular weight heteroatom counterparts. This
may suggest that the tested heteroatom diamines (DODA, DETA, and EDDA)
are less favored by CALB because of its ether or amine groups. This
is in good agreement with our earlier findings, in which we also found
that the enzymatic polymerization of polyester involving alkane-α,ω-aliphatic
linear diols is more favored compared to diethylene glycol.35 Nevertheless, our results prove the substrate
promiscuity of CALB as the biocatalyst.

and (b) FDCA-Based Heteroatom Polyamides
Influence of the Enzymatic Polymerization Method on the Molecular
Weights and Isolation Yields
Both the enzymatic polymerization
in toluene and in bulk give FDCA-based heteroatom polyamide with comparable
molecular weights, but in bulk, the molecular weights are higher.
From this, we can conclude that the enzymatic polymerization in bulk
is preferred. The high molecular weights in bulk polymerization could
be attributed to the lower enzyme catalytic activity in the organic
solvent: toluene. Toluene possesses a log P value
of 2.73, which is a suitable organic solvent for the lipase-catalyzed
polymerization. However, the presence of toluene in the system changes
the structure conformation of the enzyme and thus reduces its catalytic
activity.39 On the other hand, in the solvent-free
system, the enzyme retains its structure and thus shows a higher catalytic
activity. Furthermore, we applied vacuum in the enzymatic polymerization
in bulk where the elimination of the residual alcohol and water is
facilitated.

The enzymatic polymerization in bulk resulted in
FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides with higher isolation yields compared
to that in toluene. This is quite reasonable due to the fact that
the enzymatic polymerization in toluene gives lower molecular weight
FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides.

Microstructures of the
Obtained FDCA-Based Heteroatom Polyamides
The microstructures
and end groups of the FDCA-based heteroatom
polyamides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time
of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). Figure 3 shows the representative MALDI spectra.

Figure 3 (a) MALDI-ToF
MS spectrum of the obtained PA DODAF and (b) magnified
part with detailed peak interpretation. A–H represent eight
polyamide species ionized by K+. G′ represents the
polyamides having the acid/acid end groups that are ionized by Na+. H″ represents the polyamide having ester/amide end
groups that are ionized by H+. I–M represent five
polyamide species fragment because of the fragmentation in the heteroatom
bond. I′–K′ represent the polyamide species fragment
that are ionized by Na+. PA DODAF was produced via enzymatic
polymerization in bulk.

Similarly as in our previous study, when we used monoatomic
aliphatic
diamines, eight different polyamide species were identified (see Table 2). They were terminated
by ester/ester, amine/amine, ester/amine, acid/amine, acid/acid, ester/amide,
ester/acid, and cyclic polyamides (without end groups). However, in
this work, additional end groups are identified. The heteroatom bond
in the amine end group can easily be cleaved off during the ionization
of the molecules in the MALDI-ToF measurement, resulting in new fragmentation
patterns. Therefore, additional peaks are observed. For example, in
the MALDI-ToF spectrum of PA DODAF, the peaks assigning to the additional
end groups are marked as peaks I and J (see Figure 3 and Table S1–S3), indicating that the amine (DODA) end group of PA DODAF undergoes
fragmentation in C-α of the ether bond during MALDI-ToF measurements.

Table 2 MALDI-ToF MS Analysis: End Groups
of the Obtained FDCA-Based Heteroatom Polyamides
As previously reported by our group, the
acid end group is formed
because during the polymerization, the esters were catalytically hydrolyzed
by N435.7,11,33 The formation
of amide end groups occurred because of the reaction between amine
groups and formic acid that we use at the purification step.11

Crystallinity and Thermal Properties of the
Obtained FDCA-Based
Heteroatom Polyamides
The thermal behavior of the tested
FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides was analyzed by differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). No melting and crystallization peaks were observed.
This indicated that the obtained FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides
are amorphous materials. As confirmed by the wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) measurements, no reflection peaks but only broad halo appeared
(Figure S8).

The glass-transition
temperature (Tg) of the obtained FDCA-based
heteroatom polyamides is presented in Table 1 and Figure 4. The Tg was ranging from
41 to 107 °C. PA DETAF showed the highest Tg of 107 °C. This can be explained by two facts. First,
the repeating unit of PA DETAF is most rigid because of its shortest
chain length. Second, the intermolecular hydrogen bond density in
PA DETAF is higher due to the secondary amine groups. Moreover, the Tg of PA EDDAF approaches that of PA DODAF, even
though the molecular weight of PA EDDAF is much lower. This can also
be explained by the higher intermolecular hydrogen bond density in
PA EDDAF. We also noticed that the Tg of
FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides from enzymatic polymerization in
bulk is lower, despite having higher molecular weight. This could
be elucidated by the varied composition of the end groups generated
from different synthetic approaches.

Figure 4 DSC second heating curves of the obtained
FDCA-based heteroatom
polyamides: (a) PA DODAF, (b) PA DETAF, and (c) EDDAF.

The Tg of the synthesized
FDCA-based
heteroatom polyamides decreases as the chain length of the heteroatom
aliphatic diamine units increases. These results also agreed well
with our previous results reported in the literature,33 which indicated that the Tg of semiaromatic polyamides decreased, whereas the chain length of
the aliphatic diamine units increased.

The thermal stability
of the tested FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides
was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Figure 5 shows the TGA curves of the
FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides. The temperature at 5% weight loss
(Td-5%) of all FDCA-based heteroatom
polyamides was around 186–297 °C. The temperature of maximal
rate of decomposition (Td) of all FDCA-based
heteroatom polyamides was ranging from 351 to 432 °C. In addition,
we also observe 10% weight loss step in PA DETAF at temperature around
288–292 °C. The temperature at the maximum rate of decomposition
can mostly associate with the thermal cleavage of the amide bonds
in the polymer backbones. However, to obtain additional information
for understanding the thermal degradation mechanism steps, further
analysis using TGA-GC/MS coupling measurements is needed in the future.
Considering their high decomposition temperature, all FDCA-based heteroatom
polyamides have a very wide processing window.

FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides: (a)

Conclusions
We demonstrate that
enzymatic catalysis is a robust pathway toward
the synthesis of FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides. As confirmed by 1H NMR and ATR–FTIR analysis, a series of FDCA-based
heteroatom polyamides are successfully synthesized, with a  of up
to 16 620 g/mol. We found
that N435 shows the highest catalytic activity toward DODA, a diamine
having ether groups, compared to the other two with secondary amines.
Additionally, we found that enzymatic polymerization in bulk is more
preferred. Furthermore, MALDI-ToF MS results indicated that no polyamide
species can be assigned to the byproducts from undesirable side reaction.

All obtained FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides are amorphous materials
with relatively high thermal stability. TGA analysis results show
that all obtained FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides possess a Td-5% and Td-max at around 186–297 and 351–432 °C, respectively.
Moreover, these heteroatom polyamides possess a glass-transition temperature
at around 41–107 °C. Because of the polymer chain rigidity,
tested FDCA-based heteroatom polyamides having shorter diamine units
generally possess higher glass-transition temperature.

In the
future research, it will be of great interest to optimize
reaction parameters to facilitate the enzymatic polymerization. Furthermore,
we are aiming to thoroughly understand the enzymatic polymerization
mechanism; thus, we can design a greener and more efficient pathway
toward diverse biobased polymers.

the N435-Catalyzed Solution Polymerization of
DMFDCA with Various Heteroatom Diamines
Predried N435 (20
wt % in relation to the total amount of the monomer) and preactivated
molecular sieves (200 wt %) were placed in a 25 mL round-bottle flask
under a nitrogen environment. Subsequently, DMFDCA (5.000 mmol), diamines
(5.000 mmol), and anhydrous toluene (500 wt %) were added into the
flask. The flask was placed in an oil bath, and the reaction mixture
was magnetically stirred under atmospheric pressure at 90 °C
for 72 h. After that, formic acid (15 mL) was added to dissolve the
products and then the solution was filtrated (folded filter type 15

and detectors were held at 50 °C. Data acquisition and calculations
were performed using Viscotek OmniSec software version 5.0. Molecular
weights were determined based on a conventional calibration curve
generated from narrow dispersity polystyrene standards (Agilent and
PSS,  = 550–1 190 000
g/mol).
The samples were filtered over a 0.2 μm PTFE filter prior to
injection.

Thermal transitions of the obtained polyamides were
measured by
DSC on TA-Instruments Discovery DSC 2500. The samples were scanned
by heating–cooling–heating scans with heating–cooling
rates of 10 °C/min. Tzero aluminium pinhole hermetic pans were
used for all of the DSC measurements.

Thermal stability of the
obtained polyamides was characterized
by TGA on TA-Instruments Discovery TGA 5500 on an open pan under a
nitrogen environment. The scan rate was 10 °C/min. To remove
the remaining water and solvents in the polymer, the tested sample
was first heated up to 150 °C and then maintained at this temperature
for 30 min before the standard TGA measurement.

MALDI-ToF MS
measurements were performed on a Biosystems Voyager-DE
PRO spectrometer in the positive ionization and the linear mode using
an accelerating voltage of 25 kV. The grid voltage, guide wire voltage,
and delay time were optimized for each spectrum to achieve the best
signal-to-noise ratio. PA DODAF and PA DETAF samples were prepared
using 20 mg/mL matrix solution of dithranol in HFIP. Polymer sample
solution in HFIP (1–2 mg/mL), potassium trifluoroacetate in
HFIP (KTFA, 5 mg/mL), and dithranol (20 mg/mL) were premixed in a
ratio of 5:1:5. After that, the resulting mixture (0,2–0,6
μL) was hand-spotted on a MALDI target plate and left to dry.
PA EDDAF samples were prepared using 40 mg/mL matrix solution of DHB
in 70/30 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% TFA. Typically, a 1:2 mixture
of polymer sample solution in HFIP (1–2 mg/mL) was mixed with
the DHB matrix solution. Subsequently, the mixture was hand-spotted
on the MALDI target plate and left to dry. Polyamide species having
different end groups were determined by the following equation: MP = MEG + (n × MRU) + MK+, where MP is
the molecular mass of a polyamide species, MEG is the molecular mass of the end groups, n is the number of the repeating units, MRU is the molecular mass of the repeating units, and MK+ is the molecular mass of the potassium cation.

WAXD spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Bruker D8
Advance diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542 nm)
in the angular range of 5–50° (2θ).
