The structure of a protein complex
needs to be controlled appropriately
to maximize its functions. Herein, we report the linear polymerization
of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) through the site-specific
cross-linking reaction catalyzed by Trametes sp.
laccase (TL). We introduced a peptide loop containing a tyrosine (Y-Loop)
to BAP, and the Y-Looped BAP was treated with TL. The Y-Looped BAP
formed linear polymers, whereas BAP fused with a C-terminal peptide containing a tyrosine (Y-tag) showed an irregular
shape after TL treatment. The sterically confined structure of the
Y-Loop could be responsible
for the formation of linear BAP polymers. TL-catalyzed copolymerization
of Y-Looped BAP and a Y-tagged chimeric antibody-binding protein,
pG2pA-Y, resulted in the formation of linear bifunctional
protein copolymers that could be employed as protein probes in an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Copolymers comprising Y-Looped
BAP and pG2pA-Y at a molar ratio of 100:1 exhibited the
highest signal in the ELISA with 26- and 20-fold higher than a genetically
fused chimeric protein, BAP-pG2pA-Y, and its polymeric
form, respectively. This result revealed that the morphology of the
copolymers was the most critical feature to improve the functionality
of the protein polymers as detection probes, not only for immunoassays
but also for other diagnostic applications.

Introduction
Conjugation of protein
molecules into a large protein complex may
expand the functionalities of proteins because the protein units in
the complex may cooperatively work together. However, it is challenging
to assemble a large number of proteins into a protein complex while
retaining the functionality of each protein unit. Some protein units
might get deactivated during conjugation if the conjugation occurs
at a critical site, and some proteins may not be able to function
in the complex because of steric hindrance. Therefore, it is essential
to conjugate protein units in a site-specific manner, and the structure
of the protein complex needs to be controlled appropriately so that
the protein units in the complex can work efficiently.1

Genetic fusion of proteins is a common method to
create artificial
protein assemblies or protein polymers.2−7 However, the possible number of protein units that can be conjugated
is limited because of the difficulty in the expression of fusion proteins,
and the tandem fusion strategy requires careful linker designs to
organize the different proteins and control their characteristics.1,5,6 Such strategies also decrease
the degrees of freedom of the protein dynamics, which may lead to
impaired activity and protein misfolding.1,2,8,9 Another approach
to assemble proteins into a protein complex is to use post-translational
modifications (PTMs).10−12 PTMs enable a higher degree of polymerization than
the genetic fusing method. In particular, PTMs using enzymatic reactions
are ideal since enzymes can provide high site-selectivity with rapid
and mild reaction conditions to retain the activity of protein units.13−16

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and laccase have been utilized
for
making covalently cross-linked protein complexes with a high degree
of conjugation, i.e., protein polymers. HRP and laccase are more suitable
for making huge protein polymers than other PTM enzymes, such as transglutaminase17,18 and sortase A.19,20 This is because they conduct
oxidation reactions on tyrosine residues to yield tyrosyl radicals,
and the cross-linking between tyrosyl radicals occurs nonenzymatically
without forming tripartite complexes, which are necessary for other
enzymes.21−23 In our previous studies, we demonstrated the polymerization
of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP), as well as HRP, by a Trametes sp. laccase (TL) reaction. Both BAP and HRP were
recombinantly prepared and tethered with peptide tags containing tyrosine
residues (Y-tag).16,24 The Y-tagged BAPs and HRPs were
site-specifically cross-linked by TL to form polymers. Laccase has
an advantage over HRP because it requires only molecular oxygen to
catalyze the oxidation of tyrosine residues, while HRP requires hydrogen
peroxide, which is potentially harmful to proteins.25

The obtained dendritic protein polymers of BAPs and
HRPs were utilized
as detection probes in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
by copolymerizing with antibody-binding proteins (ABPs), such as protein
A (pA) and protein G (pG). Although the polymerization did not affect
the activity of enzyme units in the protein polymers, a large number
of enzyme units were required to copolymerize with the ABPs to surpass
the performance of the genetically fused 1:1 conjugate. In previous
work, the ELISA signal of the protein polymers became saturated at
high molar ratios of the enzyme to ABPs and even decreased at the
highest molar ratio (100:1, enzyme units/ABPs).16,24 These results suggest that some of the enzyme and ABP units are
buried inside the dendritic structure of the protein polymers and
could not function appropriately. Also, the three-dimensional dendritic
protein polymers could not be packed efficiently onto the surface
of an ELISA plate, and they occupy a large surface area per protein
polymer resulting in fewer enzyme units being immobilized.16,24

One possible strategy to solve this problem is to create linear
protein polymers.28 A linear polymer is
much simpler and less sterically hindered than three-dimensional (3D)
dendritic structures; thus, protein units in a linear protein polymer
can work more efficiently. Also, a linear molecular structure is an
ideal shape for maximizing the amount of protein polymer immobilized
on the surface.

The conventional Y-tag sequences were highly
flexible, so the cross-linked
dityrosine could again be a substrate for TL, leading to the formation
of branched structures.23,26,27,29 We anticipated that by introducing
appropriate steric hindrance to the cross-linked dityrosine, the TL
could not recognize it and thereby prevent the formation of branched
structures, favoring linear polymers. Herein, we report the linear
polymerization of engineered BAPs using a tyrosine-containing loop
peptide (Y-Loop). We genetically modified the BAP by substituting
the loop domain of the BAP structure (219–221 aa) with a 13-mer
Y-Loop (IRINRGPGYAFVT) to construct BAP-Loop-Y (Scheme 1A). We designed the Y-Loop by modifying the
loop peptide sequence from the previous reports.30−32 We anticipated
that the Y-Loop could be recognized by TL to cross-link only once
because the cross-linked Y-Loop will be too sterically encumbered
to react again with TL (Scheme 1B). We conducted scanning probe microscopy (SPM) analysis
to confirm the structural differences between the BAP-Loop-Y polymer
and the Y-tagged BAP (BAP-Y) polymer, which were prepared by TL treatment.
Furthermore, copolymerization of BAP-Y or BAP-Loop-Y and a single
Y-tagged ABP, pG2pA-Y, was performed to form BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers. The ability
of these copolymers to function as ELISA probes was also evaluated.
Our proof-of-concept study on linear protein polymerization could
contribute a new strategy to create highly functional one-dimensional
protein complexes in biotechnological applications.

of a Y-Looped Bacterial (Escherichia
coli) Alkaline Phosphatase (BAP), BAP-Loop-Y, Catalyzed
by TL
(A) BAP-Loop-Y were constructed
by substituting the loop domain of the BAP structure (219–221
aa) with a 13-mer Y-Loop (IRINRGPGYAFVT) peptide. TL recognizes and
oxidizes phenolic moieties of tyrosine residues on the Y-Loop to form
reactive tyrosyl radicals, which then react with each other in a nonenzymatic
way to form polymers. (B) Short and sterically hindered Y-Loop made
the gap between the BAP-Loop-Y units very small and prevented another
activated BAP-Loop-Y reacting at that position.

Results
and Discussion
Enzymatic Activity of Recombinant BAPs
We employed E. coli-expressed BAPs
with different structures
as model proteins for the protein polymerization reaction. Figure 1A shows the constructs
of the BAPs used in this study. We used the wild-type BAP (BAP-WT)
as the control. BAP-Y and BAP-pG2pA-Y were tagged with
a flexible peptide sequence containing a tyrosine residue (Y-tag)
at the C-termini. All of the BAPs were expressed in E. coli with high expression levels (Supporting Information, Figures S1–5 and Table S1). Although the
expression level of BAP-Loop-Y was as high as the other BAPs, we observed
cleavage of BAP-Loop-Y during expression and purification, probably
somewhere around the Y-Loop. The bands of the cleaved BAP-Loop-Y can
be seen in Figure S4C at around 20 kDa.
The cleaved BAP-Loop-Y eluted at the same elution volume in SEC purification,
indicating that the cleaved BAP-Loop-Y retained its tertiary and quaternary
structure. Different constructs of BAP showed different specific activities,
and the modification of the BAPs with Y-tags, especially BAP-Y, exhibited
approximately 34% higher activity than that of the wild type (Figure 1B). However, BAP-pG2pA-Y showed lower activity than the other BAPs; it showed
approximately 55% of the specific activity of BAP-WT. This is consistent
with the data obtained in our previous report,24 suggesting that genetically fusing pG2pA to
BAP is responsible for decreasing the BAP activity. BAP-Loop-Y showed
activity comparable to that of BAP-WT. This result also agreed with
previous reports.30,31 The Y-Loop peptide was inserted
into the BAP structure at a position away from the active site of
BAP; therefore, there was no detrimental effect on the ability of
the BAPs to recognize their substrates.

from three individual samples (***p < 0.001).

TL-Catalyzed Polymerization of BAPs
Next, we evaluated
the TL-catalyzed cross-linking reaction of BAPs. We optimized the
concentration of TL and the reaction time to perform the polymerization
reaction with high efficiency (Supporting Information, Figure S6). Then, we fixed the concentration
of TL and reaction time to 2 μM and 2 h, respectively. Figure 2A presents native-PAGE
analysis of the TL-treated BAPs. The BAP-Y, BAP-pG2pA-Y,
and BAP-Loop-Y formed polymers with high molecular weights that exceeded
the upper limit of the separating gel and, therefore, were retained
in the stacking gel. A wild-type BAP (BAP-WT) was employed as the
control reaction. After the TL treatment, no cross-linked product
was observed in the case of BAP-WT. Although there are some tyrosine
residues in the structure of BAP-WT, TL did not recognize them as
substrates. From these results, TL recognized the tyrosine residues
in the Y-tags or Y-Loop, site-selectively. These results agreed with
our previous reports.16,24 The presence of Y-tags and Y-Loops,
which can be recognized and activated by TL, eliminates the use of
phenolic mediators, such as vanillic acid,33,34 ferulic acid,35,36p-coumaric acid,35,37 and caffeic acid,38−40 and are typically used in a laccase-catalyzed cross-linking
of proteins.

and after
TL treatment. (A) Results of native-PAGE analysis of BAPs before and
after TL treatment. The concentration of the BAPs and TL were 10 and
2 μM, respectively. The cross-linking reaction of the BAPs was
conducted in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 at 37 °C for 2 h. (B) Enzymatic
activity of the BAPs before and after TL treatment using p-NPP as a substrate. Error bars denote the standard error of the
measurements from three individual samples (***p <
0.001).

To confirm the activity changes
of the BAPs after TL treatment,
we measured the enzymatic activity of the BAP monomers and polymers
using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) as a substrate (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the relative activity of the BAP polymers
was higher than that of their monomers. We found similar results when
we polymerized HRP by TL in our previous work.16 Although it is not clear why the activity increased after
the polymerization of enzymes, we expect that the small substrate
molecules require less time to be recognized by the catalytic sites
of the protein as there are many catalytic sites in the polymer, resulting
in faster reactions. TL is a more useful enzyme for the preparation
of protein polymers than peroxidases, such as HRPs, which need additional
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to initiate the polymerization
reaction. Additional H2O2 may cause changes
in enzymatic activity and deactivation of the model proteins (Supporting
Information, Figure S7).

The expected
schematic polymerization reaction of a BAP by TL is
shown in Scheme 1A.
TL oxidizes the phenolic moieties of the Y-tags or Y-Loop and generates
free tyrosyl radicals, which react with each other to form dityrosine,
trityrosine, or an even higher degree of cross-linked tyrosine derivatives.41,42 Although the reactivity of Y-Loop should be lower than that of the
Y-tags attached to the C-terminus of the BAPs (because of the steric
hindrance), all of the BAP-Loop-Y units were cross-linked by TL treatment,
indicating that the reactivity of Y-Loop is sufficient to make polymers.
In SDS-PAGE analysis of the TL-treated BAPs (Supporting Information, Figure S8), the cross-linked BAP-Loop-Y showed
clearer bands in a lower-molecular-weight region than BAP-Y and BAP-pG2pA-Y. The sharper bands of the cross-linked BAP-Loop-Y suggest
that the BAP-Loop-Y monomers were cross-linked with each other in
a more uniform way than the other Y-tagged BAPs. Since the cross-linked
Y-Loops are more sterically encumbered than the cross-linked Y-tags
at the C-terminus, further cross-linking to Y-Loops to yield oligomeric
BAPs was inhibited; this should lead to the formation of linear BAP-Loop-Y
polymers (Scheme 1B).
The multiple bands seen in the cross-linked BAP-Loop-Y is mainly caused
by the cleaved BAP-Loop-Y, which is also present in the purified BAP-Loop-Y
and can be seen at around 20 kDa. The main product of cross-linked
BAP-Loop-Y is its dimer, which appeared at around 140 kDa in SDS-PAGE
analysis.

Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) of BAP Polymers
To
validate the structural differences of BAP polymers, we analyzed the
shape of BAP monomers and polymers using an SPM in dynamic force mode. Figure 3 shows the results
of SPM analysis of BAP monomers and polymers. Thanks to the high molecular
weight of BAPs (97.6, 99.6, 142.0, and 100.5 kDa for BAP-WT, BAP-Y,
BAP-pG2pA-Y, and BAP-Loop-Y, respectively), the monomers
of the BAPs were successfully visualized as globular forms with heights
ranging from 3.5 to 4.0 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S9–13). However, some aggregates of BAP monomers
were also observed. These may be caused by the drying process before
SPM analysis. There were no shape differences between the BAP-WT monomer
and TL-treated BAP-WT, indicating that BAP-WT was intact after TL
treatment. In contrast, BAP-Y formed a huge globular shape, suggesting
that the BAP-Y monomers were connected to each other after the TL
treatment. As the Y-tag at the C-terminus can cross-link multiple
times, the BAP-Y polymer can form highly branched structures, which
would be visualized as a huge globular shape in SPM analysis. The
BAP-pG2pA-Y formed large irregular structures after TL
treatment, but the shapes of the TL-treated BAP-pG2pA-Y
were different from those of the BAP-Y polymers. This is probably
because of the presence of the chimeric protein, pG2pA,
the structure of which is linear, so the molecular structure of the
BAP-pG2pA-Y monomer and also its polymers are not globular.

Figure 3 Results
of SPM analysis of the BAPs before and after TL treatment.
The BAPs were diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 μM or
∼0.02 mg/mL in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Scale bars: 100 nm.

Interestingly, compared to other BAPs, the BAP-Loop-Y
polymers
had mostly linear shapes. The longest length of a BAP-Loop-Y polymer
observed was approximately 350 nm, and the average length of BAP-Loop-Y
polymers was 205 ± 17 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S14). This result strongly suggests that
the BAP-Loop-Y units were cross-linked through the designed Y-Loop
to yield linear polymers. A short and rigid Y-Loop consisting of 13
amino acid residues could eliminate the formation of branched structures
because of the steric hindrance caused by the BAP-Loop-Y structure.
Although the polymer length could not be controlled in this system
yet, this is the first demonstration of the use of steric hindrance
to control the structures of protein polymers, which were made via
tyrosyl radical coupling reactions. Because of the better molecular
packing on solid interfaces, linear protein polymers have the potential
to exhibit better performance than hyperbranched globular protein
polymers, especially in applications such as ELISA or western blotting
where the reactions and interactions occur on a solid surface.

TL-Catalyzed
Copolymerization of Y-Tagged Proteins
We performed the copolymerization
of BAP-Loop-Y or BAP-Y, with a
single Y-tagged chimeric antibody-binding protein, pG2pA-Y,
to create a bifunctional protein polymer that could be applied as
a detection probe in an immunosorbent assay. The copolymer of BAP-Y
and pG2pA-Y should form highly branched protein polymers
since both proteins possess flexible Y-tags at their C-termini. On the contrary, we expected the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer to form linear structures incorporating pG2pA-Y, mainly at the termini of the polymer. There are also some possibilities
for pG2pA-Y to attach to BAP-Loop-Y polymers
as side branches. Figure 4A shows native-PAGE analysis of the copolymers that were prepared
by the copolymerization reaction of BAP-Y or BAP-Loop-Y with pG2pA-Y catalyzed by TL. After TL treatment, both bands of pG2pA-Y and BAP-Y or BAP-Loop-Y disappeared, and new bands in
a high molecular-weight region were produced, indicating the formation
of cross-linked copolymers. The co-cross-linking of pG2pA-Y did not affect the activity of the BAPs since no decrease in
activity was detected after TL treatment (Supporting Information, Figure S15).

Figure 4 Copolymerization reaction of BAPs and
pG2pA-Y catalyzed
by TL. (A) Results of native-PAGE analysis of BAPs/pG2pA
copolymers after TL treatment. The concentration of both proteins
was 10 μM. TL concentration was 2 μM. The reaction was
conducted for 2 h at 37 °C. (B) SPM analysis of BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers performed
at a 1:1 molar ratio of BAPs to pG2pA-Y. The copolymers
were adsorbed onto mica after a 50 times dilution with 10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0. Scale bars: 100 nm.

Figure 4B shows
the results of SPM analysis of the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers. The shape of the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y
copolymer was different from that of the BAP-Y polymers (Figure 3). Incorporation
of pG2pA-Y changed the globular structure of the BAP-Y
polymers to form smaller globular protein polymers since pG2pA-Y possesses only one Y-tag in a molecule; thus, the attachment
of pG2pA-Y to the BAP-Y polymers terminates the polymerization
reaction. In contrast, the shape of the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y
copolymer was as linear as the BAP-Loop-Y polymers. The longest and
average length of a BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer observed
was approximately 500 and 255 ± 35 nm, respectively (Supporting
Information, Figure S14). The monomer of
BAP-Loop-Y appeared as 47 ± 1 nm of globular shape in SPM analysis
(Figure 3). It suggests
that the degree of polymerization of BAP-Loop-Y was in the range of
5–10. This suggests that the pG2pA-Y units were
incorporated at the termini of BAP-Loop-Y polymers. Although some
pG2pA-Y might have been incorporated at the cross-linking
site of the BAP-Loop-Y units in the polymers and bound as small branches,
they are probably not visible by SPM. There is also a possibility
that the pG2pA-Y mostly cross-linked with itself and not
with BAP-Loop-Y, which would result in pG2pA-Y oligomers.
The presence of the pG2pA unit is essential for the BAP-Loop-Y
polymer to bind to IgG. Therefore, the function of the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer as a detection probe in an immunoassay was
evaluated next.

Performance of the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y Copolymers
as Protein Probes in ELISA
We evaluated the functionality
of the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y
copolymers in an ovalbumin (OVA)-detecting ELISA (Figure 5). A polymer of genetically
fused BAP-pG2pA-Y was used as a control, which corresponds
to a copolymer of BAP and pG2pA cross-linked at a 1:1 molar
ratio. Both copolymers showed absorbance changes in the ELISA, indicating
that the pG2pA-Y and BAP-Y or BAP-Loop-Y were cross-linked
to each other by TL treatment. The BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer
exhibited 2-fold higher absorbance in the ELISA than the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer (Figure 5A), despite the specific activity of BAP-Loop-Y being approximately
20% lower than that of BAP-Y (Figure 1).

Figure 5 Results of the OVA-detecting ELISA using BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y
and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers. (A) Results of the OVA-detecting
ELISA using BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers prepared at a 1:1 molar ratio of BAPs to pG2pA-Y. The polymer of genetically fused BAP-pG2pA-Y was
used as a control. The concentration of the BAP polymers and copolymers
was fixed to 0.5 U/mL. The absorption of OVA onto the microplate was
conducted at concentrations of 1 ng/mL to 10 μg/mL in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) (pH 7.4). (B) Expected structure of the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers in the ELISA.
The protein G (pG) (green) or protein A (pA) (orange) can bind to
the IgG specifically. Error bars denote the standard error of the
measurements from three individual samples (*p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

These results shed light on the importance of controlling
the molecular
structure of protein polymers to maximize their functionality. The
detection probes in ELISA are on a surface, so it is important to
control the structure of the protein polymer so that they work efficiently.43,44 A surface can be considered as a set of lines, so the ideal structure
of protein polymer to maximize the molecular packing on a surface
is linear. The copolymerization reaction of BAP-Y and pG2pA-Y resulted in the formation of large, highly branched structures,24 while the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer
formed linear structures (Figure 5B). The BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer showed
higher signals than the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers at the
conditions of low OVA coating concentrations, where the molecular
packing on a surface has less effects. This suggests that the pG2pA-Y units in the linear copolymer work more efficiently than
the units in the branched copolymers. The pG2pA-Y units
in the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers are embedded within the
branched structures. On the other hand, the pG2pA-Y units
in the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer are most likely to
be conjugated at the termini of the linear structure, which is suitable
for binding to IgGs. Also, the linear structures of BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers provide better molecular packing on the surface
of the ELISA plate than the 3-dimensional highly branched BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer, resulting in a higher signal in the ELISA.
The molecular packing on the surface was particularly significant
when the OVA coating concentration was high, and there were many antibodies
on the ELISA plate surface.45 The BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer showed remarkably higher absorbance than the
BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers when there was a high OVA coating
concentration.

BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y Copolymers
Prepared with Various
Molar Ratios
To enhance the activity and functionality of
the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers
as detection probes, it is crucial to increase the molar ratio of
BAP-Y or BAP-Loop-Y against pG2pA-Y. The copolymers of
BAP-Y or BAP-Loop-Y and pG2pA-Y were prepared at various
molar ratios (Supporting Information Figure S16). Figure 6 shows
the results of OVA-detecting ELISA using the copolymers of BAPs and
pG2pA-Y that were prepared at different molar ratios. As
the ratio of the BAP against pG2pA-Y increased, the absorbance
increased in the ELISA for the BAP-containing copolymers, indicating
that a greater number of BAP units were incorporated into the copolymers
with pG2pA-Y. Intriguingly, the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer showed an almost linear increase in absorbance in
proportion to the ratio of BAP-Loop-Y, while the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer reached its peak at a ratio of 75:1; the absorbance
decreased at a ratio of 100:1. At a ratio of 100:1, the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer exhibited 26- and 20-fold higher absorbance
than BAP-pG2pA-Y and its polymer, respectively. To fully
understand the functionality of BAP and pG2pA copolymers,
we purified them from the remaining monomers using size exclusion
chromatography (SEC). The copolymers with high molecular weights were
completely separated from the monomers by SEC (Supporting Information Figure S17A,B). To confirm the functionality
and activity of the purified BAP/pG2pA copolymers, we applied
them again in an OVA-detecting ELISA (Supporting Information, Figure S17C). The purified copolymers performed
better as detection probes than those that were not purified. The
BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer showed higher signals in ELISA
than the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers. This result revealed
that the morphology of the copolymers was the most critical feature
to improve the functionality of the protein polymers as detection
probes, not only for immunoassays but also for other diagnostic applications.

Figure 6 Results

prepared at various molar ratios. The concentration
of pG2pA-Y was fixed to 0.5 μM. While the concentrations
of BAP-Y and BAP-Loop-Y were varied from 0.5–50 μM. The
concentration of TL was 2 μM. The reaction was conducted in
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C, for 2 h. All protein polymer
solutions were diluted to fix the concentration of pG2pA-Y
as a binding domain to 1 nM. The concentration of OVA that coated
the wells was 1 μg/mL in TBS (pH 7.4). ND: not detected. Error
bars denote the standard error of the measurements from three individual
samples (*p < 0.05, **p <
0.01, ***p < 0.001).

The use of a large number of enzymes in the copolymerization reaction
with binding proteins results in the formation of highly branched
structures in which the binding proteins tend to be buried inside
the structures and are not able to function correctly. Therefore,
in previous studies of protein polymers using Y-tagged proteins, there
is often an optimum ratio of enzyme to binding proteins to extract
the best functionality as detection probes.16,24,46 Since the molecular structure of the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymer is linear and the pG2pA-Y units
are mostly conjugated at the terminus of the polymers, the pG2pA-Y could efficiently bind to the antibody on the ELISA plate,
while carrying a large number of enzymes. The results here demonstrate
the advantages of linear protein polymers over highly branched protein
polymers.

Conclusions
We demonstrated a new
strategy for controlling the structure of
protein polymers by utilizing tyrosine-containing loop peptide, Y-Loop.
The Y-Looped BAP, BAP-Loop-Y, formed linear polymers, whereas BAPs
fused with a C-terminal Y-tag showed irregular shapes
in SPM analysis. The sterically confined structure of the Y-Loop and
a closely cross-linked BAP-Loop-Y caused steric hindrance around the
cross-linked tyrosine residues at Y-Loops and prevented further cross-linking
reactions and branch formations. Furthermore, linear BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers that were prepared from the copolymerization
reaction of BAP-Loop-Y and pG2pA-Y showed excellent functionality
and activity as protein probes in an OVA-detecting ELISA. These results
suggested that the linear structure of the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers allowed them to pack better on the anti-OVA IgG surface
than the globular BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers. Interestingly,
the absorbance of the BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers that
were prepared with higher molar ratios of reporter enzyme to IgG-binding
protein (BAP-Loop-Y to pG2pA-Y) increased across the whole
range tested. Further study on the SEC fractions of the purified BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y confirmed its excellent functionality and activity as
an ELISA probe, which showed a higher signal than the BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y copolymers. It can be concluded that the size of polymers
containing the reporter enzyme is not the only factor to improve their
performance as a protein probe in an immunoassay. The shape of the
protein polymers could be the most important factor in improving the
functionality and activity of protein polymers. This newly proposed
linear polymerization of the BAP strategy can contribute to the further
development of functional protein polymers for specific applications
in biotechnology, biomedical sciences, bioimaging, and diagnostics.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
TL was provided by Amano Enzyme Inc. (Nagoya,
Japan). TL was dissolved in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0,
and purified from impurities using an Amicon ultrafiltration device
(50 kDa MWCO). Dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, potassium
dihydrogen phosphate, para-nitrophenyl phosphate
(p-NPP), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hydrochloric
acid, tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), and sodium ampicillin were
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan).
Tryptone and yeast extract were purchased from Difco (Miami). Trizma
base and imidazole were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan).
Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from
Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). Acrylamide/bis solution 30% was purchased
from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). All reagents were used as
received.

Preparation of Y-Tagged Proteins
We constructed E. coli expression vectors of the proteins used in
this study using the plasmid vectors of pET22b(+)-BAP and pET22b(+)-pG2pA as templates.14,24,47 The pG2pA is a chimeric protein composed of two protein
G (pG) domains and a protein A (pA) domain fused in tandem.47 To construct the expression vector of the BAP-Loop-Y,
the DNA encoding the EWQ at the position of the loop domain of BAP
was replaced with the DNA encoding the Y-Loop sequence (IRINRGPGYFVT).
We designed the sequence of Y-Loop based on the loop peptide sequence
from the previous reports.30,31 The amino acid sequences
of the proteins used in this study are listed in the Supporting Information. All of the proteins were expressed
and purified according to a previously reported protocol.14,24

Enzymatic Assay of BAPs
p-NPP was
used as a substrate to measure the activity of the BAPs. The BAPs
were diluted to an appropriate concentration using 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0). We pipetted 10 μL of BAP solutions into 990 μL
of 1 mM p-NPP in 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in a 1 mL
quartz cell for UV–vis spectrophotometry. We monitored the
absorbance at 410 nm for 3 min at 25 °C. The measurement was
replicated three times for three individual samples of each BAP.

TL-Catalyzed Polymerization of Proteins
We conducted
the polymerization of the BAPs and the copolymerization of BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA-Y and BAP-Y/pG2pA-Y by mixing with TL in 10
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 50 μL. The final concentration
of the BAP was 10 μM, and we optimized the concentration of
TL and reaction time (Supporting Information). The polymerization reaction was performed by incubating a mixture
of the Y-tagged proteins and TL at 37 °C for an optimized length
of time. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE.

Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) Imaging of the BAP Polymers
Samples of BAP monomers and polymers were diluted 10–50
times using 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Four microliters of the sample
solution were then placed onto mica, which was freshly cleaved (Nilaco
Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature.
The mica was then rinsed once using ultrapure water and dried under
ambient conditions. The SPM images were taken using a Nanocute (Hitachi
High-Tech Science Corp., Japan) using an SI-DF3P2 microcantilever
(Hitachi)48 in the dynamic force mode.

ELISA Using BAP Polymers
The Y-tagged BAP polymers
were used as detection probes in an ELISA. The OVA (albumin from chicken
eggs) was diluted to concentrations ranging from 10 μg/mL to
0.1 ng/mL using Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, and pipetted into
a flat bottom microplate (96-well, 100 μL/well) and the microplate
was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The OVA-coated wells were then
washed with 200 μL of TBS containing 0.1% of Tween-20 (TBST)
three times. The blocking solution (TBST solution containing 1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA)) was added (200 μL/well) and incubated for
1 h at RT. The wells were then washed with 200 μL of TBST three
times. The rabbit anti-OVA-IgG (C6534–2 mL; Sigma-Aldrich),
used as the primary antibody, was diluted with TBST containing 1%
BSA to a concentration of 1 μg/mL and then 100 μL was
added to each well, followed by 2 h incubation at RT. The wells were
washed with 200 μL of TBST three times. The diluted BAPs, BAP-Loop-Y/pG2pA, and BAP/pG2pA polymers were then added to each
well (100 μL/well) followed by 1 h incubation at RT. After washing
the wells with 200 μL of TBST three times, 100 μL of p-NPP solution (1 mM in 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) was added
to each well. A 96-well microplate reader (BioTek, Synergy HTX) was
used to monitor the changes of the absorbance at 410 nm for 1 h at
25 °C.

Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) of BAP
Copolymers
The SEC samples of BAP copolymers were prepared
according to the
same procedures for TL-catalyzed polymerization of proteins, which
are mentioned above. The molar ratio of BAPs to pG2pA-Y
was set at 100:1 (50–0.5 μM) with a total volume of 1
mL in 10 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0). The concentration of TL was adjusted
to 5 μM to facilitate high copolymerization efficiency between
the BAPs and pG2pA-Y in a large volume. The polymerization
reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 18 h. The copolymer solution
was then injected into the SEC column (HiLoad Superdex 200 pg, GE
Healthcare). The SEC mobile phase was 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The
fractions containing polymers were pooled and concentrated using an
ultrafiltration membrane (30 kDa MWCO) and analyzed using SDS-PAGE
and native-PAGE. The enzymatic activity of the polymers was measured,
and they were functionally evaluated as probes in ELISA.

Statistical
Analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Student’s t-test functions in Microsoft Excel
(Version 2016 for Macintosh, Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) were used
to perform statistical analysis. P values of <
0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
