Zinc
and copper are essential metal ions for numerous biological
processes. Their levels are tightly maintained in all body organs.
Impairment of the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in serum
was found to correlate with many disease states, including immunological
and inflammatory disorders. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide, and its
activity is modulated by zinc and copper ion binding. Harnessing the
intrinsic properties of OT is one of the attractive ways to develop
valuable metal ion sensors. Here, we report for the first time an
OT-based metal ion sensor prepared by immobilizing the neuropeptide
onto a glassy carbon electrode. The developed impedimetric biosensor
was ultrasensitive to Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions at
physiological pH and not to other biologically relevant ions. Interestingly,
the electrochemical impedance signal of two hemicircle systems was
recorded after the attachment of OT to the surface. These two semicircles
suggest two capacitive regions that result from two different domains
in the OT monolayer. Moreover, the change in the charge-transfer resistance
of either Zn2+ or Cu2+ was not similar in response
to binding. This suggests that the metal-dependent conformational
changes of OT can be translated to distinct impedimetric data. Selective
masking of Zn2+ and Cu2+ was used to allow for
the simultaneous determination of zinc to copper ions ratio by the
OT sensor. The OT sensor was able to distinguish between healthy control
and multiple sclerosis patients diluted sera samples by determining
the Zn/Cu ratio similar to the state-of-the-art techniques. The OT
sensor presented herein is likely to have numerous applications in
biomedical research and pave the way to other types of neuropeptide-derived
sensors.

Introduction
The human body has
an elaborate system for managing and regulating
a number of key trace metals circulating in blood and stored in cells.1−3 Decrease in the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in serum
was found to correlate with many disease states, including immunological
and inflammatory disorders, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple
sclerosis (MS), skin diseases, and also cancer.4−10 Monitoring the level of Zn2+ to Cu2+ in blood
is a very attractive way for early diagnosis of diseases.11 For example, quantification of the zinc to copper
ratio in MS patients ranges between 2 and 3, whereas this ratio in
healthy subjects ranges from 5 to 6.12

Many analytical methods such as atomic absorption spectroscopy,13,14 inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (ICP–MS),15,16 ICP–atomic emission spectroscopy,17 and physicochemical techniques18−20 are in use for the determination
of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ion concentrations. These methods
provide low detection limit and high specificity but rely on expensive
instrumentation and require tedious sample preparation and operation
protocols. These limitations underscore the need for portable (point-of-care)
devices so that the testing can be done conveniently at the time and
place of patient care or field study.

During the past few years,
electrochemical methods have been played
a significant role in the diagnostic detection of various metabolites
in biofluids. The principle of work is that the chemical nature of
the recognition layer determines the type of the analyte to be detected,
the selectivity, and the sensitivity of the sensor. Biopolymers such
as DNA,20−22 enzymes,23−25 proteins,26,27 and peptides28−30 serve as selective and active recognition layers
in various electrochemical sensors because they have intrinsic properties
that determine their binding partners. Sensors that rely on the above
biomolecules, especially proteins and peptides, have been used for
the detection of metal ions.31−33 Peptides are attractive candidates
for the development of selective biosensors because of their high
specificity to metal ions; their amino acid sequence can be easily
modified and also be functionalized with different moieties to allow
for self-assembling on various types of surfaces. Moreover, the ease
of attaining bioactive confirmation upon metal binding makes peptides
perfect candidates to use in biofluids.34 A large variety of strategies such as self-assembled peptide-based
electrochemical sensors,35,36 peptide nanofibrils,37 potentiometric stripping analysis at the bismuth-film
electrode,38 and peptides anchored to aryldiazonium
salt-grafted graphite electrodes have been reported for metal-ion
sensing.39 Fogg et al. reported the voltammetric
determination of Cu2+ concentration by the preformed poly-l-histidine film at a hanging mercury drop electrode.40 Chow and Gooding showed that the tripeptide
Gly–Gly–His selectively interacts with Cu2+, while its isomer Gly–His–Gly, cross-reacts with Cu2+ and Zn+.41

Oxytocin
(OT) is a neuropeptide (Figure 1A) that has affinity for metal ions and is
a highly conserved mediator of physiologic and psychic processes.
An OT–metal complex interacts with the OT receptor, which belongs
to the G-protein-coupled receptor family, in a process that activates
several different second messenger systems.42,43 The concentration of metals is detrimental for regulating the OT
function because binding to Zn2+ enhances the peptide affinity
to the OT receptor, whereas binding to Cu2+ results in
the opposite effect.44,45

Figure 1 (A) Chemical structure of OT with ring
(blue) and tail (red) parts
and (B) complex formation of Zn2+ and Cu2+ with
OT in two different conformations at lower concentrations of the metal
ions, and there could be also intermolecular binding sites at higher
concentrations of the metal ions.

Using OT as the recognition layer for impedimetric sensors
aimed
to detect zinc and copper in biofluids is highly valuable because
the peptide is the selective binding element of the two ions, and
unlike artificial chelators, the peptide is optimized to work under
physiological conditions. To exploit OT as a recognition element,
we prepared a new synthetic peptide with the entire OT sequence but
equipped with an azide-functionalized handle. We immobilized this
functional OT peptide onto the electrode (OT sensor) and used impedimetric
methods for selective detection of Zn2+ and Cu2+. The OT sensor displayed selectivity toward zinc and copper but
not toward other metal ions. Interestingly, we observed that the impedimetric
spectra have two hemicircles, indicating that there are two domains
with different capacitances. Moreover, the impedimetric response of
the sensor to each of the ions was very characteristic and was highly
dependent on the nature and the concentration of the ion analyte.
Masking agents were applied for the detection of zinc ions in the
presence of copper and vice versa. The proposed approach proved to
be a sensitive and selective method for the determination of Zn2+ and Cu2+ concentrations that are important for
fast and easy medical diagnosis. The analytical applicability of the
OT sensor was validated by the discrimination of healthy and MS patients
based on the differences in their Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio.

Results and Discussion
OT Assembly on Oxide Surfaces
Many
functional groups
in OT are essential for the metal-binding properties and bioactivity.
We designed an OT-based sensor in such way that the essential functional
group of the peptide will stay intact and the covalent attachment
to the surface will be made from a moiety that is not required for
metal binding. To that end, we used a bioorthogonal chemical reaction
called a “click reaction” that relies on the spontaneous
reaction between an azide moiety and an alkyne moiety to form a triazole.
Click chemistry is a very useful way to attach unprotected peptides
to surfaces because the nucleophilic functional groups on the amino
acid residues side chains do not participate in the coupling reaction.
We synthesized a new OT analogue that contains the OT peptide functionalized
with azide (OT-Az) ready for the click reaction. Using solid-phase
peptide synthesis protocols, OT was synthesized and then azidoacetic
acid was attached to the amino terminus of OT because it was shown
that this site is not essential for OT binding and activation.46 We also prepared a glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
or silicon wafer surfaces that have a reactive alkyne moiety anchored
on them so that the linkage to OT-Az can be performed by the click
reaction (Figure 2).
Because the standard click reaction requires the addition of a copper
catalyst, we wanted to use a “copper-free” click reaction
because the OT sensor is designed to detect traces of Cu2+ and we wanted to avoid any traces of the latter. Hence, the surfaces
were functionalized by dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) that enables the
formation of the triazole without the addition of copper.47 The azide-functionalized OT was attached to
the DBCO-functionalized surfaces using a copper-free click. The fabrication
process of the OT sensor was confirmed by following the physical characterization
of OT immobilized on a silicon wafer (OT wafer) in the same manner
as the OT sensor. Both the fabrication of the OT sensor and of the
OT wafer were carried out in multiple steps process that was practically
identical for the two surfaces (see Figure S2). The assembly process of the oxide surfaces was analyzed and characterized
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared reflection–absorption
spectroscopy, and ellipsometry (Figures S3 and S5 and Table S1). These analytical
methods proved that the process is reproducible and reliable and clearly
show that the peptide was attached to the surface and that the metal
ions bind to the OT sensor.

DBCO-functionalized
surface by click chemistry.

Atomic Force Microscopy of OT Wafer
The variation in
the mean roughness of the silicon wafer surfaces on each modification
step was monitored using atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the obtained
topographic images are shown in Figure 3 (and Figure S4). Averaged
value of root mean square of roughness (ρ) was considered to
eliminate local effects. A silicon substrate with hydroxyl functional
groups after cleaned using the root cause analysis method shows a
surface roughness of 2.03 Å, which is the characteristic value
of a clean single-crystal surface. After modification with 2% 3-aminopropyl(triethoxysilane)
(APTES), the Si substrate showed a homogeneous surface with a roughness
of ∼2.29 Å because of the aminopropyl functionality-containing
siloxane coupling unit. After functionalization with DBCO and OT,
the surface roughness increased to 2.56 and 2.96 Å, respectively.
An increase in surface roughness was observed for the multistep functionalization
of the Si substrate with OT. The roughness of the OT wafer has increased
significantly to 4.8 Å after incubation of the electrode in 1
nM Zn2+ solution, whereas it is decreased to 2.0 Å
after incubation in 1 nM Cu2+ solution (Figure 3). These results indicate that
the change in surface roughness is metal ion-dependent. This unveils
that the different peptide–metal coordinations are translated
to a distinct packing of the monolayer. The binding of each metal
ion to the OT surface will lead to a different conformational change
of the peptide layer and hence will result in divergences in the surface
topography.

μm) recorded for (a) OT-immobilized Si/SiO2 (OT wafer)
(ρ = 2.9 Å), (b) OT wafer + 1 nM Zn2+ solution
(ρ = 4.8 Å), and (c) OT wafer + 1 nM Cu2+ solution
(ρ = 2.0 Å).

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
To investigate the
chelation of the metal ions to OT grafted on silicon substrates, OT
wafers were characterized using XPS before and after incubation with
Zn2+ and Cu2+. As can be seen in Figure S3, the OT wafer did not show any peak
corresponding to Zn2+ and Cu2+ (traces “a”
and “c”). However, after incubation with Zn2+ ions, the spectrum (trace b) indicated a peak at 1018.7 eV corresponding
to Zn(2p3/2) in the 2+ oxidation state. This value was
lower than the binding energy of fully oxidized zinc because of the
chelation by OT. The OT wafer incubated with Cu2+ solution
showed two peaks at 932.6 and 952.1 eV attributed to Cu(2p3/2) and Cu(2p1/2), respectively (trace d).

Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy of the OT Sensor
Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize
and study the OT sensor as it is highly sensitive to modification
on the surface and can be used to detect any changes on the surface
in response to metal binding. Nyquist plots (real Z′ vs imaginary Z′) obtained for the
GCE after each modification step showed a significant increase in
the capacitance of the monolayer that indicates the formation of the
insulating layer (see Table 1). Subsequent to the click addition of OT-Az, we observed
not only an increase in the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) value but also an additional semicircle that appears
in the higher Z′ range (at a lower frequency)
in the Nyquist plot (Figure 4). Although the increase in RCT due to the addition of OT to the surface is expected, the appearance
of the two semicircles is very unique.

As is seen in Figure 4, the Nyquist plot of OT sensor is a combination
of two time constants
(semicircles). Following models of electrode/electrolyte interfaces
have been used to describe the physical origin of the Nyquist plots.
The equivalent circuit for immobilized OT on the GCE is constructed
from the following elements: the Ohmic resistance of the electrolyte
solution, Rs and Warburg impedance, Rw (contributed to the diffusion of the bulk
electrolyte of the ions to the electrode interface). We attribute
the origin of the two capacitive regions as follows: one is due to
the “grain” OT ring/electrolyte interface (CRS) and the other is due to the “grain boundaries”
OT tail/electrolyte interface (CTS) with
corresponding two electron-transfer resistances RRS and RTS, respectively,
as expected from a layer with two different domains (Figure 1B). The equivalent circuit
depicted in Figure 4 (curve d) represents the circuit that best fits the impedance data
for the OT sensor. The anchoring of the OT molecule onto GCE-DBCO
provided two capacitive elements, and consequently, the electrode/electrolyte
consisted of two interfaces, CPESR and CPEST in series. We assume that it results from the two domains in the
monolayer: one is ring-dominated domain and the other tail-rich domain
(Figure 1B).

Chronocoulometric experiments were performed to quantify the OT
probe density of the OT-modified electrode surface where the electrostatic
trapping of cationic redox molecules takes place in polyionic media.48,49 The obtained chronocoulometric responses for Fe2+/Fe3+ redox probe at the OT-GCE are shown in Figure S6. The data for the OT-GCE show that there is a negligible
nonspecific adsorption in the absence of redox probe. However, in
the presence of redox probe, there is a better increase in the charge
at the OT-GCE.

Chronocouloumetry defines charge-time dependence
for linear diffusion,
and the charge at the electrode is provided by the following Anson
equation.50 1  where n is the number of
electron per redox molecules, F is the Faraday constant
(96 458 C), A refers to the area of the electrode
(0.071 cm2), D is the diffusion coefficient
(cm2/s), C is the concentration of the
redox probe (50 μM), Qdl is the
double layer charge, and Qads is the charge
due to the adsorption of redox molecules on the electrode surface.
The term Qads becomes zero in the absence
of redox probe as no adsorption takes place and hence can be determined
from the chronocoulometric experiments performed in the presence and
absence of redox probe. The saturated surface excess marker (Γ)
in terms of the OT probe density has been determined from the following
relationship. 2  

The surface excess of the OT-GCE is
determined from the difference
in intercepts of the Q versus t1/2 plots. The value of Γ for the OT-GCE is found to
be 3.7 × 10–12 M, and in terms of molecules,
it is 2.3 × 1012 molecules/cm2. The determined
surface density is on par with the other reported values for tripeptide
or DNA-based self-assembled layers on the gold electrode.41,49

Impedimetric Detection of Zn2+/Cu2+ Ions
Using OT Sensor
After analyzing the equivalent circuit and
realizing the influence of the two domains of the OT monolayer on
the impedimetric signal, we were able to focus on the response of
the sensor to the presence of metal ions. We have performed a series
of experiment in which the OT sensor was exposed to increasing concentrations
of either Zn2+ or Cu2+ in a range of 1 pM to
100 nM before the impedance was recorded. These studies showed a gradual
increase in the impedimetric signal in response to the concentration
of Zn2+ and Cu2+, indicating that the OT sensor
can be used to detect both metals (Figures 5A and 6A). The corresponding
Nyquist plots for the detection of the metal ions are shown in Figures S7 and S8. However, the type of change
in the impedimetric signal was metal-dependent. With a gradual increase
in the Zn2+ concentration, both hemicircles radius were
increased, whereas in response to a gradual increase in the Cu2+ concentration, the increase of the radius of the second
hemicircle (lower frequency) was more dominant. In both the cases,
the change in the linear part that relates to the diffusion through
the solvent was constant and insignificant.

derived from the five electrodes. The red and blue curves are polynomial
fitted curves, and the black curve is linearly fitted.

(SR), OT tail (ST), and solution resistance Rs with a slope of 0.06 (RSR), 0.16
(RST1), 0.72 (RST2), and 0.005 M–1 (Rs). The error bars represent the standard deviation derived from the
five electrodes. The red and blue curves are polynomial fitted curves,
and the black curve is linearly fitted.

In each case, the normalized impedimetric signal was considered
to confirm that the observed change is due to surface modification
but not due to any superimposed effects. The normalized RCT is obtained by calculating the ratio of RCT for the concentration of M2+ (RCT(Ci)) and of the blank solution
(RCT(Co))
of the OT sensor. For both the ions, we plotted a graph that presents
the logarithmic concentration of the ions versus normalized RCT of the three components: OT ring (RSR), OT tail (RST), and solution resistance (Rs) (Figures 5B and 6B). In response to zinc, both RSR and RST monotonically and significantly
show a sensitivity of 0.11 M–1 for the sensors.
On the contrary, although there is a linear correlation between Cu2+ concentration and RSR with a
slope of 0.065 M–1, we observed two linear regimes
for RST: RST1 for the picomolar range and RST2 for
the nanomolar concentration range (Figure 6B). The slope of the fitted curve for the
low concentration regime was found to be RST1 ≈ 0.16 M–1, similar to the response for
zinc ions. The higher concentration regime shows a much steeper slope RST2 ≈ 0.72 M–1, assumingly
because of intermolecular chelation that leads to a denser monolayer.
The limit of detection was determined as 500 fM for Cu and 100 fM
for Zn following the methods developed by Long and Winefordner.51 To confirm the response of GCE-OT to Zn2+/Cu2+ ions is not due to any nonspecific binding,
control experiments of the metal ions dose responses were performed
on the GCE-DBCO electrode. As can be observed from Figures S9 and S10, there is no appreciable increase in the RCT. In the case of Zn2+, the electrode
response is hardly reaching 15% even at 1 μM concentration.
However, there is some increase in resistance observed at 10 μM
Cu2+, assumingly because of the nonspecific adsorption
of free amines. However, the analytical application of OT sensor was
studied at 1 nM concentration ranges of the Zn2+/Cu2+ ions. With the reproducibility of the proposed OT sensor,
five different GCEs were fabricated and the response of the sensor
for 1 nM Zn2+/Cu2+ solution was evaluated (Table S2). Standard deviation of the normalized sensor’s response
is about 4%, which suggests the better reproducibility of the fabricated
sensor. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one report on
peptide-based electrochemical detection of Zn2+.41 The linearity range and detection limits of
the proposed sensor for Zn2+ and Cu2+ are on
par with the previous peptide-based electrochemical sensors.36,37,41,52,53

Previous mechanistic studies claim
that OT binds zinc and copper
in42,45 therefore, although the binding mechanism
is different, there is a shared metal ions binding site in OT. According
to the reports, Cu2+ complexes OT in a square planar conformation
mostly through the amides of the tail, whereas Zn2+ forms
an octahedral complex through the carbonyls of both the ring and the
tail (Figure 1B). Each
configuration exposes different functional groups toward the metal
ion. This situation represents a unique mechanism in which there is
no single or double binding sites but a shared one. OT cannot bind
Zn and Cu simultaneously. We suggest that the two semicircles correspond
to two different domains in the OT monolayer—the first domain
is rich with the ring motif (see blue part in Figure 1B), and the major component of the second
domain is the OT tail (see red part in Figure 1B). We assume that the different behavior
of OT sensor toward Zn2+ and Cu2+ is related
to the nature of the binding of OT to these metals as reported previously.
The binding mechanism depicted in Figure 1B is possible at low concentrations of the
metal ions; however, there could be intermolecular chelation of metal
ions at higher concentrations.54 We assumed
that the increase in the RCT is related
to the conformational change of the peptide that results from the
chelation of higher concentration of ions. Because each ion binding
imposes a distinctive conformational change on the peptide, the packing
density of the layer will depend on the metal ion and its concentration.

Selectivity Studies
The selectivity of the OT sensor
toward various metal ions that are known to frequently coexist with
Zn2+ and Cu2+ in biological and environmental
systems was evaluated.55,56 The corresponding Nyquist plots
obtained for various metal ions and their normalized sensor response
are presented in Figures S11 and S12, respectively.
The sensor clearly shows a higher response to Zn2+ followed
by Cu2+ in comparison to other metal ions.57 We assume that the selectivity of the sensor toward Zn2+ and Cu2+ is due to the biologically optimized
OT chelating properties. To evaluate the tolerance limit of Cd2+ more precisely in the presence of 1 nM Zn2+,
the former ion concentration has been gradually increased to see the
change in the Zn2+ signal (Figure S13A,B). As can be observed from Figure S13B, there is some contribution from the Cd ions toward the measured
EIS signal. This contribution decreases significantly when the ratio
between Zn2+ and Cd2+ reaches the physiological
condition, that is, at 10–11 M Cd2+,
there is 4% signal increase in comparison with 1 nM Zn2+ signal alone.

Using Masking Agents to Achieve Selectivity
between Zinc and
Copper
The OT sensor showed superior detection of Zn2+ and Cu2+ compared to other metals, but it had
similar sensitivity for these two ions. It was crucial to determine
if the OT sensor is capable of detecting Zn2+ in the presence
of Cu2+ and vice versa. The parallel detection of Zn2+ and Cu2+ was achieved using a selective masking
strategy.58 Thiourea (TU) was used to mask
Cu2+ to enable selective Zn2+ detection.51 Pyrophosphate (PP) was used for masking Zn2+ to enable selective Cu2+ detection as was reported
previously.59,60 To determine the efficiency of
the masking agent strategy on the OT sensor response, each masking
agent was added to the OT sensor containing either Zn2+ or Cu2+. Our results showed that negligible response
for Cu2+ in the presence of TU in contrast to Zn2+ that showed a full response (Figure 7). Similarly, when the OT sensor response was recorded
for the mixture and individual ions in the presence and absence of
PP, the results showed preferential masking of Zn2+ by
PP. Studies using a 1:1 mixture of Cu2+ and Zn2+ showed that charge-transfer decrease in the presence of TU reached
a similar level of response observed when only Zn2+ was
used. When PP was added to the 1:1 mixture of Cu2+ and
Zn2+, a decrease in charge transfer was observed and reached
the same level of response as was recorded for the solution containing
only Cu2+. These results showed that the OT sensor can
be used for the selective detection of Zn2+ and Cu2+ even when both ions are present in the mixture simply by
masking one of them selectively.

of 1 nM Zn2+ and 1 nM Cu2+ in a 1:1 mixture

Zn2+ to Cu2+ Ratio Determination in Diluted
Sera Samples
The Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio
in MS patients is lower than that for healthy subjects and, hence,
can be used as a biomarker to detect MS.54 It is of high relevance to prepare a sensitive and selective electrochemical
sensor to enable a fast determination of Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in biofluids. To evaluate the potential applicability
and analytical reliability of the OT sensor in biofluids, it was used
to determine the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in healthy
and MS-diluted sera samples and the results were compared to the ICP–MS
analysis of the same samples. For the simultaneous detection of Zn2+ and Cu2+ in the same diluted sera samples, TU
and PP were used to mask one of the metal ions in the presence of
the other. Our study indicated that there was a significant reduction
of the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio value between healthy
and MS patients. Although the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio
of healthy patients sera was 9.11, the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio value of MS patients sera was around 4–6.

The
quantification of the metal ions concentration in the same sera samples
was validated using ICP–MS. The concentrations of elements
using ICP–MS also vary with the sample preparation method because
of the difference in total dissolve solids. Here, we followed the
acid digestion protocol to achieve maximum decompose or removal of
the organic matter, and the obtained concentrations are in line with
the literature.61 Slightly higher concentrations
of both ions were obtained by EIS because of the other serum components
in comparison to ICP–MS (Table 2). The Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in
diluted sera samples calculated from ICP–MS for healthy subjects
is 5.82 ± 0.05, whereas this ratio drops to 2.15 ± 0.07
and 2.33 ± 0.01 (with ≤5% RSD) for two different MS patients.
By considering the Zn to Cu ratio as an indicator, the values are
on par with the values obtained by the OT sensor measurements: 9.11
± 0.08, for the healthy subject and 6.01 ± 0.11 and 4.11
± 0.07 for the two different MS patients. This proves that the
OT sensor enable to monitor changes in the Zn2+ to Cu2+ ratio in sera samples as a tool to evaluate patients health
status.

b In EIS experiments, Zn2+ values were measured in the presence of TU and Cu2+ values
were measured in the presence of PP.

Conclusions
Peptides are valuable
candidates for biosensing. Their ability
to easily change conformation upon interaction with their natural
binders can be translated to electrical sensing. The conformational
changes of OT upon Zn2+ and Cu2+ binding leads
to different monolayer packing motifs and are evident from the AFM
and EIS studies. We demonstrated that the metal ions-dependent change
in the conformation of OT produces a unique electrochemical signal
pattern that is the outcome of the collective peptides response on
the surface. We showed here that using this principle produces a very
sensitive and selective metal ion biosensor. The OT sensor proposed
here can open new avenues for the development of point-of-care sensing
devices for neurodegenerative diseases such as MS that relies on neuropeptides
as a recognition layer.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
APTES,
dibenzocyclooctyl-N-hydroxy succinimide (DBCO-NHS), N-(dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC), triisopropylsilyl
chloride, and 2-azidoacetic acid were procured from Sigma-Aldrich.
Ethanol (ACS grade), potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), potassium hexacyanoferrate(II),
sodium phosphate dibasic, and sodium phosphate monobasic were purchased
from Merck Chemicals. All chemicals were of analytical reagent (AR)
grade and used without further purification. Aqueous solutions were
prepared using Millipore water received from Milli-Q system (Millipore
Inc.). 9-Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected amino acids (Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH,
Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Leu-OH, and Fmoc-Ile-OH)
and Fmoc-Rink-Amide-MBHA resin were procured from Iris Biotech GMPH.
Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH and Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH were purchased
from GL Biochem Ltd.

Synthesis of the OT-Az Peptide
Azide-functionalized
OT (OT-Az) was synthesized using standard solid-state peptide synthesis
procedures. The synthesized OT was functionalized by attaching an
azido moiety to the terminal amine (see Supporting Information).

Preparation of the GCE for Fabrication
Initially, the
GCE surfaces were thoroughly polished using 0.05 μm alumina
suspensions on microcloth pads (CH instruments). After polishing,
the electrodes were sonicated in ultrapure water for 15 min. The well-polished
mirror-finished GCE surface was characterized by recording impedance
spectra as well as cyclic voltammograms in 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– in a 0.1 M phosphate solution (PBS)
of pH 7.0. The observed RCT is around
25 Ω, whereas the differential peak potential of cyclic voltammogram
(ΔEp) is ∼70 mV. The GCE
surface was suspended in 1% KOH solution, and the solution was stirred
at 100 rpm for 15 min.62,63 It is reported that the resulted
GCE surface consists of 94.8% C and 5.2% O, compared to 95.5% C and
4.5% O—obtained for the untreated GCE.63

Assembling of OT on Oxide Surfaces
The assemblies of
the OT sensor and of the OT wafer (Figure S2) were performed following the same steps: (a) fabrication of alkylamine-functionalized
surface—approximately 4 μL of 2% APTES in AR grade ethanol
was reacted with the oxide surface for 2 h. The electrode/wafer was
washed with ethanol (×3) to remove excess APTES and byproducts,
blown by nitrogen gas flow, and dried for 2 h. (b) Fabrication of
DBCO-functionalized surface—the amine-functionalized surface
was incubated for 6 h in a cocktail of 0.5 mg of DBCO-NHS ester and
0.25 mg of EDC, in 1 mL of ethanol (ACS grade). After 6 h, the electrode/wafer
was removed from the solution and washed thoroughly with ethanol (×3)
and air-dried. (c) Fabrication of OT sensor via “click”
chemistry—concentration of N-(2-azidoacetyl)-oxytocin
(OT-Az) was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and diluted
the stock solution to get desired concentration. DBCO-functionalized
surface was incubated for 12 h in 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.0 containing 50
μM OT-Az. After incubation, the OT-coated electrode/wafer was
washed with PBS and dried under nitrogen gas.

Monolayer Characterization
Silicon wafer (Si wafer)
has been used as the model substrate to follow the surface chemistry
step by step. Hence, the fabrication process of the OT sensor was
evaluated by studying the changes in the physical properties of the
Si wafer that went through the same fabrication process as the OT
sensor. The increase in the monolayer thickness and the change in
the surface roughness that was observed in different stages of the
process indicated the formation of the same monolayer on the OT sensor
(Table S1).

Determination of the Concentration
of Cu2+ and Zn2+ Ions in the Serum of Healthy
and MS Patients
Fresh
blood collected from a peripheral vein from patients with confirmed
diagnosis of MS. Blood samples were collected in “Z Serum Sep
Clot Activator” tubes, and serum was isolated after centrifugation.
Serum samples were preserved in −20 °C. Prior to the treatment,
the frozen samples were thawed to room temperature. Serum samples
were filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon membrane syringe filter
(Fisher Scientific, India) before EIS measurements. A 200 μL
filtered human serum samples were diluted 25 times with PBS (pH 7.0)
without any further treatment. The OT sensor was incubated in the
healthy control and MS-diluted sera samples mixed either with 10 μM
TU or with 10 μM PP. The electrodes were washed with PBS, and
the impedimetric signal was recorded. The obtained impedimetric signal
was normalized and fitted to the calibration curve to determine the
concentration of each ion. For Zn2+, we considered the RSR curve for the Zn2+ detection,
whereas RST curve in the case of Cu2+ determination.
