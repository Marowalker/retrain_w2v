A novel, one-step
protocol for the selective synthesis of W2C nanoparticles
from phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40), a low-cost and commercially available tungsten
compound, was developed. The nanoparticles had diameters of 1–50
nm and were dispersed on a carbon substrate. The W2C nanoparticles
were prepared by a simple operation sequence, involving impregnation
of carbon black with H3PW12O40 followed
by calcination at 1000 °C. X-ray diffraction study revealed the
selective formation of the W2C phase in the samples prepared,
whereas the tungsten carbide (WC) phase was present in the control
prepared from H2WO4. Stable W2C nanoparticles
were obtained using this method owing to the presence of phosphate
at the interfaces between the W2C nanoparticles and the
carbon substrates, which inhibited the diffusion of carbon atoms from
the carbon substrates to the W2C nanoparticles, leading
to the formation of WC. The W2C nanoparticles prepared
showed an excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER), with low Tafel slopes of ∼50 mV/decade. The
HER catalytic activity was notably high, being comparable to that
of MoS2, which is a promising alternative to Pt. The present
method can potentially be applied to produce highly effective, low-cost,
Pt-free electrocatalysts for the HER.

Introduction
Hydrogen is an environmentally
clean fuel and one of the more promising
alternatives to fossil fuels. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER), a process that produces hydrogen through electrolysis
of water, is an important technology for establishing the “hydrogen
economy”. Proton electrolyte membrane
(PEM)-based water electrolysis is a promising technology because of
its favorable energy efficiency, production rate, and the size of
these systems when compared with that of traditional alkaline electrolysis
systems.1 In spite of these advantages,
water electrolysis using PEM has not been practically implemented
for hydrogen production processes owing to the cost of the precious
metal catalysts used in this technology. Therefore, finding nonprecious
metal HER catalysts is an urgent issue for the commercial implementation
of this technology.

Tungsten carbides (WCs) are promising candidates
as nonprecious
metal HER catalysts, owing to their stability in acidic solutions
and the similarity in their electronic structures to that of Pt.2,3 In recent years, many efforts have been taken toward the development
of highly active HER catalysts based on WCs.4−6 The crystalline
phases of WCs depend on the synthesis protocols used, the most common
phases being the most stable WC and metastable W2C and
WC1–x phases.7 These phases are predicted to afford different catalytic
activities. Colton et al. investigated the electronic structures of
these carbides using a computational technique and concluded that
the catalytic activity of W2C is higher than that of WC
owing to its higher 5d-orbital electron population.8 Expectedly, these phases have different catalytic activities
for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR);9 interestingly, nanosized, metastable W2C has higher activity
for the HOR than stable WC.10 A comparison
of the catalytic activities of W2C and WC thin films for
HER by Esposito et al.11 revealed a smaller
Tafel slope for W2C than for WC. These studies show that
nanosized W2C should afford better HER activity than WC.
For the utilization of WCs as HER catalysts, preparation methods that
allow the selective formation of the catalytically active W2C phase nanoparticles to achieve a high specific surface area of
the catalyst should be developed. Chemical vapor deposition and some
chemical synthetic methods have been examined for the preparation
of finely dispersed W2C nanoparticles with diameters of
2–55 nm.12−14 However, these methods are very complicated and do
not selectively generate W2C nanoparticles but produce
WC nanoparticles because the metastable W2C phase is readily
transformed into the stable WC phase in the presence of carbon sources.
Thus, the preparation of W2C nanoparticles remains a challenging
issue because of their instability.

Herein, we demonstrate a
novel, one-step, selective protocol for
the synthesis of W2C nanoparticles with diameters of 1–50
nm, dispersed on carbon black (CB). The W2C nanoparticles
are prepared from phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40), a low-cost and commercially available tungsten compound.
We also demonstrate the importance of phosphorus in stabilizing the
metastable W2C phase. Finally, we demonstrate the excellent
HER catalytic activity of the W2C nanoparticles prepared,
with high onset potentials and low Tafel slopes as compared to those
of a commercial WC catalyst.

Results and Discussion
Selective Formation of
W2C Nanoparticles
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
of the samples prepared (Figure 1a) revealed the selective
formation of the W2C phase in the PWCs. Mainly peaks attributable
to the W2C phase (indicated by red circles: (110) at 34.5°,
(002) at 38.1°, and (111) at 39.6°) were observed in the
XRD profiles of all three PWCs.15 However,
trace amounts of WC were formed in PWC0.5 and PWC1, as evidenced by
the peaks indicated by the black triangles. By contrast, WOC1 included
both WC and W2C phases, showing a remarkable development
in the WC phase compared with that observed for the PWCs. The composition
ratios of W2C/WC were determined by Rietveld refinement
of the XRD patterns as 0.98:0.02, 0.98:0.02, and 0.42:0.58 (mole ratios)
for PWC0.5, PWC1, and WOC1, respectively (Figure S1). The observed stability of the W2C phase formed
in the PWCs is unusual because the W2C phase is relatively
unstable and is easily converted to the WC phase at temperatures above
900 °C.16

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of PWCs
and WOC1. The enlarged patterns show 002
peaks of carbon. (b,c) XRD patterns of the samples prepared with different
heat treatment times. The periods of heat treatment at 1000 °C
are indicated in parentheses.

Mechanisms for the formation of WC have been described in
previous
studies,17,18 which suggest that WC is formed by the slow
bulk diffusion of carbon to W2C. Reddy et al. reported
the necessity of isothermal holding time to transform W2C to WC at 1050 °C owing to the slow bulk diffusion of C to
W2C.18 Prolonged heat treatment
at 1000 °C was applied to both PWC1 and WOC1 to compare the stability
of the W2C phase in these species. The W2C phase
formed in PWC1 was confirmed to be stable, as shown in Figure 1b, which demonstrates that
the diffraction profile of the sample heat-treated for 3 h (PWC1(3
h)) is the same as that of the as-synthesized PWC1. However, the conversion
of W2C to WC was clearly observed in the case of WOC1 subjected
to heat treatment for the same period, as shown in Figure 1c.

As mentioned above,
we achieved stable deposition of W2C particles on the PWCs.
However, the mechanism of formation is not
yet clear. Because the precursor, H3PW12O40, includes phosphorus, which is the major difference compared
with the other precursor, H2WO4, we evaluated
the possibility of the participation of phosphorus in the formation
of stable W2C phase. Figure 2a shows the P 2p regions of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of PWC1 before and after H2O2 treatment.
The main P 2p peak at ∼133 eV remained almost unchanged after
removing WC from the carbon support, whereas the small peak at 137
eV, which was attributed to phosphorus in high oxidation states, disappeared.19 The main P 2p peak was attributed to P–C
bonds and tetracoordinated phosphorus, which indicates the presence
of a phosphate-like structure.20 This indicates
that phosphorus originating from H3PW12O40 is covalently bonded to the surface of the carbon in PWC1
via C–O–P or C–P–O bonds, even after heat
treatment at 1000 °C. It is well known that the phosphate groups
on the carbon edge sites function as blockages for the oxygen gasification
of carbon, thereby improving the oxidation resistance of carbon.21 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies supported
the presence of phosphate groups. Figure 2b shows TGA curves of the H2O2-treated samples prepared from PWC1 and WOC1. The sample obtained
from PWC1 exhibited higher resistance to carbon oxidation than that
from WOC1. This confirms the presence of phosphate groups on the carbon
edge sites in the PWCs. The edge sites of carbon materials have 2000
times higher chemical activity than the carbon basal plane;22 thus, the formation of WC seems to occur at
the interface between the W2C nanoparticle and the carbon
edge sites. The difference in the activity of the edge sites versus
the basal planes can be exploited in the formation of WCs from tungsten
and carbon precursors. In fact, Reddy et al. reported that amorphous
carbon affords a larger amount of WCs than crystalline carbon via
a solid-phase reaction of WO3 and carbon.23 These results can be understood in terms of the difference
in the number of edge sites of amorphous carbon versus crystalline
carbon. If phosphate groups are formed on the carbon edge sites of
PWCs, these groups will inhibit the transformation of W2C to WC owing to their stabilizing effect on the carbon edge sites.
However, there is insufficient experimental evidence to support this
inhibition effect; thus, further study is underway in our laboratory
to understand the effect of phosphorous on the stabilization of W2C.

Figure 2 (a) P 2p regions of XPS spectra of PWC1 and H2O2-treated PWC1. (b) TGA curves of H2O2-treated PWC1 and WOC1 obtained under flowing air.

The aforementioned one-step synthesis provided
monodisperse W2C nanoparticles of 1–50 nm diameters
on the CB surfaces,
as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and XRD studies.
The TEM images and the size-distribution histograms of the WC nanoparticles
in PWCs and WOC1 are shown in Figure 3. In the images, regions with higher electron density
correspond to particles (indicated by white arrows in Figure 3) with sizes of 1–50
nm, distributed on the carbon surface. Furthermore, the formation
of smaller particles with diameters <5 nm was also confirmed. The
selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed the presence
of W2C in the samples prepared. In the case of WOC1, the
diffraction patterns attributed to the WC phase were also confirmed.
The SAED results completely agreed with the XRD results. The original
morphology of CB was preserved even after carburization, confirmed
by the stacked structure observed in the TEM images, which was also
confirmed by the presence of the carbon 002 peaks at ∼25°
in the XRD patterns (Figure 1). The presence of the CB substrate after carburization is
beneficial for the application of the PWCs to electrochemical catalytic
electrodes because the remaining CB substrate maintains the electrical
conductivity and effective surface area of the samples. Thus, the
structural studies using XRD and TEM revealed that the present single-step
synthesis with H3PW12O40 is an effective
way to produce metastable W2C on a CB substrate. The particle
size of metastable W2C could be controlled by selecting
an appropriate W/CB weight ratio in the precursor.

of nanoparticles and the stacked carbon layers of CB, respectively.
SAED patterns in PWC1 and WOC1 were obtained in the regions indicated
by green arrows.

Evaluation of the HER Activities
Previous studies have
suggested that compared with WC, W2C nanoparticles have
a relatively higher HER activity.8,11 Thus, we assessed
the potential of the PWC samples as electrochemical catalysts for
the HER. Figure 4a
shows a comparison of the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans obtained
using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique by employing 0.5
mol/L H2SO4 versus that of two types of commercial
WC nanoparticles, WC (300 nm) and WC (150 nm), and a Pt disk electrode.
To investigate the effect of phosphate-like structure on HER, the
same measurement was performed for both CB and H2O2-treated PWC1. Tafel plots were also constructed from the
LSV scans for quantification of the HER activity (Figure 4b). Characteristic values representing
the HER activity evaluated from the LSV scans and Tafel slopes with
the loading amount of WCs are summarized in Table 1, which show that the PWCs exhibit higher
catalytic activity for HER than the commercial WC catalyst. PWC1 showed
the highest activity among the samples used in the present study.
CB and H2O2-treated PWC1 have little activity
for HER (shown in Figure S2), which indicates
that WCs formed on the CB act as a catalyst on HER. In general, the
Tafel slopes of WC catalysts for HER in acidic solution are in the
range of 70–120 mV/decade.4,11,24 All PWCs exhibited similar low Tafel slopes, with
the values being as low as ∼50 mV/decade, indicating that the
HER mechanism of all samples is almost the same. Therefore, the difference
in the HER activities of the respective samples is attributed to the
difference in the amount of catalyst loaded into the PWCs. PWC0.5
contains half the amount of W2C catalyst as that in PWC1;
nevertheless, the I–0.2 and EH2 values of these two samples are almost the
same, indicating that there is an upper limit to the activity. This
can be attributed to the fact that increasing the amount of tungsten
on the carbon support increases the particle size, thereby decreasing
the specific surface area of the WC. Notably, the W2C catalysts
prepared by the present one-step synthesis exhibit high HER activities,
as shown in Table 1, comparable to those of MoS2, which is a good alternative
to Pt as a catalyst.25

To evaluate the relationship between
the crystalline phases of
the WCs and the catalytic activity, the HER activity of WOC1 was also
evaluated along with that of the PWCs (Figure 4a,b). Although the WC phase of WOC1 differs
from that of PWC1, as indicated by the XRD measurements, the Tafel
slopes and I–0.2 and EH2 values of both species are almost the same. The proportion
of the W2C phase in the WOC1 catalyst is much lower than
that in the PWC1 catalyst. Therefore, WOC1 is expected to show lower
activity than PWC1 because the catalytic activity of W2C is higher than that of WC.8 However,
our experimental results disagree with this prediction. Our results
indicate that the surface states of PWC1 and WOC1 are essentially
similar.

The surface states that influence the catalytic activity
are defects,
compositions, and crystal planes. Raman spectroscopy was performed
to investigate the defect in the WC particles. Both PWC1 and WOC1
showed two peaks that originated from W–C and W–O bonds
in the wavenumber range of 500–1000 cm–1;26,27 the shapes are broad and the intensities are quite small, as presented
in Figure S3. Although difference in the
samples was not clearly shown because of their low S/N ratio, the
observed broad and small peaks indicated the presence of defects in
the WC particles. XPS measurements were carried out to analyze the
surface states of the WC nanoparticles in the samples and to determine
the source of the observed disagreements. Figure 4c shows the XPS spectra of W 4f for the PWCs
and WOC1 samples. All samples have similar spectral profiles, despite
the differences in the crystal phase composition of the WCs.

This observation suggests that the surface states of WOC1 are essentially
similar to those of the PWCs, which explains the similar HER activity
of WOC1 and PWC1. The chemical states of W were identified by deconvolution
of the W 4f signals, based on a previous study.28 The W 4f region displays four peaks. The doublet peaks
located at 31.6 and 33.8 eV correspond to W 4f7/2 and W
4f5/2 of the W–C bonds, respectively; another set
of doublet peaks located at 35.4 and 37.5 eV indicates the presence
of WO3 on the surface. Formation of the tungsten oxides
was ascribed to the inevitable surface oxidation of WCs.24 In the case of PWC0.1, the intensity of these
oxide peaks is equal to that of the W–C bonds because of the
large surface area of the W2C nanoparticles in this sample,
which contributes to the oxidation of the catalyst particles. In summary,
the similar HER activities of WOC1 and PWC1 can be attributed to the
similar surface chemical states of the WC nanoparticles formed on
the carbon supports, as revealed by the XPS study.

XPS investigation
with Ar etching provides further information
on the WC nanoparticles in PWC1 and WOC1. Figure 4d shows the W 4f signals before and after
Ar etching for 2 min. After etching, the position of the W 4f peak
of WOC1 shifted marginally to the higher-energy region, whereas that
of PWC1 remained unchanged. The energies of the W–C bonds of
W2C can be expected to be slightly lower than those of
WC, owing to the low charge transfer between carbon and tungsten atoms
in the former.10,29 The peak shift observed for WOC1
suggests that the surface chemical state of the outermost surface
of the carbide particles formed in this sample is similar to that
of the PWCs (“W2C-like” phase). However,
the innermost part of the carbide particles is a “WC-like”
phase, as depicted in Figure 5. This agrees with the fact that both PWC1 and WOC1 show the
same catalytic activity for HER and that the carbides in WOC1 have
W2C and WC crystalline phases, as indicated by the XRD
analysis (Figure 1).
The nanoparticles were produced through carburization between the
solid phases, that is, CB and the tungsten precursor. The solid-phase
reaction occurs at the interface of these two phases; hence, the formation
of WC at the surface is difficult owing to the slow diffusion of C
to the W2C phase.18

Materials and Methods
Sample
Preparation
The single-step synthesis of the
W2C nanoparticles dispersed on the carbon support involved
one-step heat treatment of H3PW12O40 (Nippon Inorganic Colour and Chemical Co., Ltd.) loaded on CB (Vulcan
XC-72R, Cabot Co.). CB was mixed with H3PW12O40 in three different weight ratios (weight ratios of
W element to CB were 1:1, 0.5:1, and 0.1:1) in deionized water. The
water was evaporated under vacuum until a dry solid was obtained,
which was heat-treated at 1000 °C for 1 h under N2 flow. The resulting heat-treated samples (corresponding to W/CB
weight ratios of 1, 0.5, and 0.1) were denoted PWC1, PWC0.5, and PWC0.1.
Here, the numbers in the sample names indicate the W/CB weight ratio
in the precursors. To evaluate the effect of phosphorous in H3PW12O40, a reference sample denoted
WOC1 was also prepared from CB and tungstic acid, WO3·H2O, as follows: the two materials were mixed in 2 mol/L aqueous
NH4OH solution at a W/CB weight ratio of 1 in the precursor.
The solvent was evaporated, and the resultant dry solid was heat-treated
under the conditions used for the PWC samples.

Characterizations
To investigate the surface structure
of the carbon supports of the samples after heat treatment, the WC
particles formed on the carbon supports were removed by immersing
the samples in a 30 wt % aqueous H2O2 solution
for 75 min at room temperature. We also confirmed that the WC was
completely removed by the treatment using XPS. The loading amounts
of WC in the samples were calculated from the weight loss by H2O2 treatment.

XRD analysis was performed
using a LabX XRD-6100 (Shimadzu Co., Ltd.) instrument with Cu Kα
radiation. The composition of WC and W2C was determined
by Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns obtained. TEM was carried
out on a JEM-2010 (JEOL Co., Ltd.) microscope at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV. Surface composition and depth profile analyses of the elements
contained in the samples were performed using XPS (Kratos Axis Nova,
Shimadzu Co., Ltd.) with an in situ Ar sputtering gun. The valance
states of P and W were evaluated from the XPS spectra that were corrected
using the C1s peak at 284.5 eV. TGA was performed on the H2O2-treated samples under flowing air using a heating rate
of 10 °C/min. A Raman spectrometer (Nicolet Almega XR, Thermo
Fisher Scientific Co. Ltd.) was used to assess the WCs formed on the
CB.

Electrochemical measurements were performed on the samples
to evaluate
their activity as HER catalysts. LSV scans were obtained using the
RDE technique with 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte;
the data were compared with those of two types of commercial WC nanoparticles,
WC (300 nm) (WC03NR, particle size: ∼300 nm, A.L.M.T. Corp.)
and WC (150 nm) (particle size: ∼150 nm, Sigma-Aldrich Co.)
and a Pt disk electrode. Tafel plots were also constructed from the
LSV scans for quantification of the HER activity. The RDEs were prepared
by depositing sample ink (1.78 μL of 1.4 wt % sample dispersed
in 0.7 wt % Nafion solution) onto a 4 mm glassy carbon disk electrode.
The loading amount of each catalyst was set at 200 μg/cm2. The scans were performed at various rotation speeds ranging
from 1600 to 2400 rpm at a scan rate of 1 mV/s in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution saturated with nitrogen.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile and
selective method
for producing metastable W2C nanoparticles with diameters
of 1–50 nm. In this synthesis, phosphorus plays an important
role in stabilizing the metastable W2C phase. The nanoparticles
obtained are dispersed on CB, which is beneficial for their practical
use as electrochemical catalysts because of their high surface area
and electron conductivity. The method developed for preparing W2C nanoparticles is both efficient and simple and does not
involve any complicated processes such as chemical vapor deposition.
These features are advantageous relative to the previously reported
approaches for the fabrication of WC nanoparticles. Moreover, the
utility of the W2C nanoparticles synthesized as HER electrochemical
catalysts with activity comparable to that of MoS2 was
demonstrated. Thus, the catalysts obtained by the method developed
are expected to be highly effective, low-cost, Pt-free electrocatalysts.
Further studies are underway in our laboratory to evaluate the mechanism
of HER and to obtain a more detailed analysis of the mechanism of
the formation of PWCs.
