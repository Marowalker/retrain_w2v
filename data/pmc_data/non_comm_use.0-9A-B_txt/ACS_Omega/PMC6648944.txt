A facile
approach was developed to produce MoS2 nanosheets
by ultrasound-assisted reflux exfoliation, which was highly efficient
for large-scale production and sustainable for environment. The interlayer
force of bulk MoS2 was first exhausted in employing LiOH/NaOH
solution by reflux and thereafter quickly exfoliated by ultrasound.
The lateral size of the as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets with
about 2–9 layers became smaller. Definitely, the average friction
coefficient and wear scar diameter of 0.08 wt % MoS2-based
oil decreased by about 21.87 and 38.09% relative to the base oil,
which displayed better antifriction and antiwear performances.

1 Introduction
MoS2 has attracted
the attention of many researchers,
owing to the interlayer van der Waals force and intralayer covalent
bond,1,3 which showed excellent properties in the
field of catalyst,4,5 battery,6,7 sensor,8 nanotransistor,9 hydrogen
storage,10 supercapacitor,11and so on. More importantly, MoS2 also exhibited
excellent lubrication performance due to the interlayer van der Waals
force.12,13 At present, the bulk MoS2 has
been widely used as an antiwear additive in solid greases,14 but it cannot be used in liquid lubricants due
to its unstable dispersion. The specific surface area of the bulk
MoS2 is increased through nanotechnology to obtain MoS2 nanosheets and enhance the stable dispersion in liquid lubricants.
Definitely, various MoS2 nanomaterials have proven to exhibit
preferable friction-reducing performance.15−17 This finding
showed that the structure of MoS2 nanomaterials obviously
affected the friction-reducing properties. Yi et al.18 synthesized three morphologies of MoS2 nanomaterials,
including flower-like, microspheres, and nanosheets, by hydrothermal
and solvothermal methods. The as-synthesized MoS2 in liquid
paraffin improved the tribological properties. MoS2 nanosheets
exhibited excellent tribological performances compared to flower-like
MoS2 and MoS2 microspheres under the same testing
conditions. As far as the antifriction and antiwear in oil are concerned,
the quality of nanosheets required is much lower than for other purposes.
Conversely, too thin or too large, both are improper to be used in
oil.

Up to now, many highly efficient exfoliating methods have
been
exploited to prepare MoS2 nanosheets. Krishnamoorthy et
al.19 successfully prepared MoS2 nanosheets with few layers using 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP)
as an exfoliated solvent and via a ball milling method. Varrla et
al.20 demonstrated that the bulk MoS2 in the aqueous surfactant solution was massively sheared
and exfoliated to MoS2 nanosheets with a mean thickness
of 4.6 nm using a kitchen blender. Bang et al.21 provided an easy liquid-phase exfoliation method with NMP
and NaOH to improve the yield of single-layered MoS2 nanosheets
and the thickness of the as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets varied
from 1 to 9 nm. Additionally, the Li-intercalated exfoliation has
been successfully achieved in many types of nanosheets.22 Therefore, Liu et al.22 obtained ultrathin and high-yield MoS2 nanosheets with
a uniform thickness of 4.68 nm through the hydrothermal exfoliation
route using Li+ and ethylene glycol. However, the expensive
Li source and hazardous organic solvent still hindered the scalable
production. Meanwhile, the superimposing of MoS2 nanosheets
usually took place after cleaning the organic solvent.2 Recently, we successfully exfoliated BN to few layers
via the hydrothermal intercalation and exfoliation method with NaOH/KOH
solutions.23 Due to this idea, the exfoliation
of bulk MoS2 in mixed alkaline solution became a feasible
method.

In this paper, we provided an efficacious exfoliation
method based
on the well-established ultrasound-assisted reflux method to prepare
MoS2 nanosheets. The as-exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets
were detected through a series of characterization methods. Then the
friction and wear performances of MoS2 nanosheets in oil
were tested through a four-ball friction machine.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of MoS2 and four kinds of as-exfoliated MoS2. In Figure 1a, all of the MoS2 samples show four feature peaks at 14.4, 32.7, 39.5, and 58.3°,
ascribing to the (002), (100), (103), and (110) planes of MoS2 (JCPDS No. 37-1492), respectively. Every peak is attributed
to the lattice of representative MoS2 and there is no additional
peak from MoO3. It proves that this MoS2 is
a single phase and polycrystalline structure.24 In particular, all lattice planes of four kinds of as-exfoliated
MoS2 show weaker peak intensities than bulk MoS2. The possible reason is that the as-exfoliated MoS2 has
fewer layers than bulk MoS2. In Figure 1b, the bulk MoS2 has larger lateral
size and thickness. Obviously, four kinds of as-exfoliated MoS2 exhibit a smaller size and more transparent nanosheets (Figure 1c–f). More
importantly, after the processes using a single alkali solution (Figure 1c,d) and a single
reflux method using alkaline solution (Figure 1e), the bulk MoS2 is exfoliated
into multilayer. In comparison to these as-exfoliated MoS2 samples, the thickness of MoS2–Li+/Na+ is filmiest. This result proves that the ultrasound after
the reflux process using mixed alkali solutions accounts for the deep
exfoliation of the bulk MoS2 into fewer layers. These results
indicate that bulk MoS2 exfoliated by both Li+ and Na+ under the ultrasound-assisted reflux method obtains
the most ideal nanosheets compared to the single ion and single method.23

Figure 2 displays
the Raman spectra and UV–vis spectra of MoS2 and
MoS2–Li+/Na+. In Figure 2b, MoS2 and MoS2–Li+/Na+ obtain
two characteristic peaks at about 381 and 406 cm–1.25 The peak intensities and peak positions
of MoS2–Li+/Na+ have changed.
Importantly, the frequency difference between E2g1 and A1g peaks of MoS2–Li+/Na+ is 22 cm–1, which is lower than
25 cm–1 of the bulk MoS2. This indicates
that the number of layers for MoS2–Li+/Na+ decreases after exfoliation.26,27 In Figure 2b, two
peaks at about 630 nm (1.97 eV) (B) and 680 nm (1.82 eV) (A) are shown
in the UV–vis spectra of MoS2–Li+/Na+ dispersions. The two peaks are assigned to the exciton
transitions of MoS2 at the first Brillouin zone.28 After exfoliation, the peak of MoS2–Li+/Na+ is consistent with the bulk
MoS2. However, MoS2–Li+/Na+ shows more pronounced peaks than MoS2, indicating
that the ultrasound-assisted alkaline solution reflux route plays
an important role in the exfoliation process. In addition, the percentage
of the size for MoS2–Li+/Na+ is calculated (Figure 2d) according to the TEM image of MoS2–Li+/Na+ in 10 μm (Figure 2c). The percentage of the nanoscale size
(<1 μm) is as high as 78.29% and the vast majority size is
below 2.0 μm.

MoS2–Li+/Na+, (c) TEM image
and (d) the percentage of size for MoS2–Li+/Na+.

The thickness and size
of MoS2–Na+, MoS2–Li+, and MoS2–Li+/Na+ are verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
(Figure 3a–c).
In Figure 3a,b, MoS2–Na+ and MoS2–Li+ have about 2.70–5.33 and 2.54–6.15 nm of the height
and the number of the corresponding layers is about 4–9 layers
and 4–10 layers. MoS2–Li+/Na+ (Figure 3c)
has a larger irregular-shaped size, the height is about 1.00–5.48
nm, and the number of corresponding layers is about 2–9 layers.
The as-exfoliated MoS2–Li+/Na+ is further examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) (Figure 3d).
The thickness of MoS2–Li+/Na+ with 0.62 nm of interlayer basal spacing is up to about 2–4
layers due to more easily exfoliated edges of nanosheets, which corresponds
to the (002) plane of MoS2. The corresponding selected
area electron diffraction pattern (Figure 3e) of MoS2–Li+/Na+ reveals polylattice diffraction rings, showing the
retention of polycrystalline MoS2–Li+/Na+ during exfoliation.29

Figure 4 displays
the tribology data of 150 SN base oil and the base oil with 0.08 wt
% MoS2–Li+/Na+ inspecting
for 6 h. In Figure 4a, the friction coefficient (COF) of MoS2–Li+/Na+ is less than that of base oil throughout the
test time. Compared to the base oil, the average COF and average wear
scar diameter (AWSD) of MoS2–Li+/Na+ are decreased by about 21.87 and 38.09%, respectively. The
result indicates that the bulk MoS2 slides with difficulty
into the contact surface of the steel ball with the flow of the base
oil to reduce the COF and WSD due to MoS2 with a large
size, a thick thickness and poor dispersibility in base oil. Owing
to the MoS2-AC-S with fewer layers and smaller size, it
is easy to infiltrate into the contact surfaces of counterpart to
become a tribofilm.30 Surprisingly, the
COF of MoS2–Li+/Na+ increases
with the friction time. This indicates that the stability of MoS2–Li+/Na+ in base oil is unsatisfied
in testing time. Figure 4c,d show three-dimensional (3D) profiles of wear surfaces of balls
tested by base oil and the base oil with 0.08 wt % MoS2–Li+/Na+. The contact areas of testing
balls are severely damaged to a different degree after 6 h. Compared
with the two kinds of wear mark, the damaged surface of the steel
ball after MoS2–Li+/Na+ as
additives is decreased owing to preferably becoming the tribofilm
on the wear surface, when the MoS2–Li+/Na+ nanosheets in base oil contacted the steel balls.31 For further demonstration of the tribofilm,
the wear surfaces of balls are determined by Raman spectroscopy. The
appearance of two characteristic peaks of MoS2 on the contact
surfaces examined by MoS2–Li+/Na+. The friction value decreasing mechanism is deduced that
MoS2 nanosheets in base oil can smoothly slip into the
contact surface to prevent the wear of steel ball.32,33

3 Conclusions
In summary,
the MoS2 nanosheets with about 2–9
layers were successfully prepared by an ultrasound-assisted reflux
exfoliation method. The ultrasound processing played an important
role in the union exfoliation. MoS2–Li+/Na+ as lubrication additives were added into 150 SN base
oil to evaluate their lubrication properties. COF and WSD of 0.08
wt % MoS2–Li+/Na+-based oil
decreased by 21.87 and 38.09% compared to the base oil, revealing
better tribological properties.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Two-dimensional
MoS2 nanosheets were obtained by the exfoliation method
combining the reflux and ultrasound process. In particular, 0.73 g
of LiOH and 1.22 g of NaOH were dispersed in 180 mL of deionized water,
then 1.02 g of bulk MoS2 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd) was added into the above solution and stirred at room temperature
for 2 h. Next, the suspension was transferred to a 250 mL three-necked
flask with a stirrer and refluxed at 100 °C for 3 h, denoted
as MoS2–R. Then, the three-necked flask with MoS2 nanosheets was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 2 h, and
the cold water was continuously added into the ultrasonic bath to
control the water temperature during the ultrasonic process. Next,
the solution was allowed to stand for 30 min and the precipitate was
removed. Finally, the upper liquid was cleaned by deionized water
and anhydrous ethanol at least three times, dried at 60 °C for
24 h, denoted MoS2–Li+/Na+. In addition, the MoS2–Li+ sample was
obtained in the absence of NaOH and the MoS2–Na+ sample was obtained in the absence of LiOH in the same reflux
and ultrasound exfoliation method. The exfoliation illustration of
MoS2 nanosheets is proposed in Figure 5.

4.2 Tribological
Properties Testing
MoS2–Li+/Na+ nanosheets were added
into 150 SN base oil through the ultrasound method to obtain MoS2–Li+/Na+-based oils. The testing
of tribological properties was executed in an MMW-1 four-ball machine
(Jinan Chenda Ltd. Co., in China). The rotating speed, stably applied
load, and testing time of the test parameters were set to 1200 rpm,
100 N, and 6 h, respectively. The wear scar of the steel ball was
cleaned with ethanol to remove the base oil and then detected through
the Raman spectrometer and 3D laser scanning microscope.

4.3 Characterization
XRD analysis was
performed by Powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker AXS, German). The SEM
images were obtained by an S-4800 II Field emission scanning electron
microscope (Hitachi, Japan). The TEM images were obtained by a Tecnai
12 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Netherlands). The Raman
spectra were recorded by an InVia Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, Britain).
The UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer
(Varian). HRTEM images were obtained by a Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN field
emission transmission electron microscope (FEI). The AFM images were
obtained on a nanoscope (Digital Instruments). The wear scar micrographs
were recorded by an LSM 700 3D Laser Scanning Microscope (CARL ZEISS,
German).
