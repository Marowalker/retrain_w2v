Nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) is one of the most dangerous
air pollutants that can affect human health even at the ppb (part
per billion) level. Thus, the superior sensing performance of nitrogen
dioxide gas sensors is an imperative for real-time environmental monitoring.
Traditional solid-state sensors based on metal-oxide transistors have
the drawbacks of high power consumption, high operating temperature,
poor selectivity, and difficult integration with other electronics.
In that respect, graphene-based gas sensors have been extensively
studied as potential replacements. However, their advantages of high
sensing efficiency, low power consumption, and simple electronic integration
have been countered by their slow response and poor repeatability.
Here, we report the fabrication of high-performance ultraviolet (UV)-assisted
room temperature NO2 sensors based on chemical vapor deposition-grown
graphene. UV irradiation improves the response of the sensor sevenfold
with respect to the dark condition attaining 26% change in resistance
at 100 ppm NO2 concentration with a practical detection
limit below 1 ppm (42.18 ppb). In addition, the recovery time was
shortened fivefold to a few minutes and the excellent repeatability.
This work may provide a promising and practical method to mass produce
room-temperature NO2 gas sensors for real-time environment
monitoring due to its simple fabrication process, low cost, and practicality.

Introduction
Gases NO2, SO2, H2S, CO, H2, and CH4 in the atmosphere can seriously threaten
the safety and health of human beings.1−3 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in particular, which is produced by combustion of fossil
fuels, can affect human health even at the ppb (part per billion)
level.2−4 Therefore, real-time environmental monitoring with
gas sensors has become much important in our daily life. Meanwhile,
gas sensors also play an important role in medical diagnosis, industrial
safety, and food quality control.5−8 This has been the motivation in recent years
for the progress in the research on gas sensors.6,9

Traditional solid-state gas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors
have low cost and high sensitivity.8 Nevertheless,
their performance still has the shortcomings of high operating temperatures,
high power consumption, poor selectivity, low integration degree,
and poor long-term stability. Hence, it is an important goal to improve
the performance of next generation of gas sensors. Desirable qualities
include high sensitivity, low detection limit, fast response and recovery
time, high integration degree, room-temperature operation, and low
energy consumption.10

Novel nanostructured
materials with small volume and specific structures
have demonstrated extraordinary potential for application as sensing
layers.2,11−14 As a member of two-dimensional
materials, graphene has been the subject of intensive research because
of its excellent physical and chemical properties,15−17 including its
single-atom thickness, unique energy band structure, outstanding electrical
properties, high carrier mobility,18 large
surface-to-volume ratio, and great thermal conductivity.19

Graphene has great prospects in the fields
of biology, chemistry,
machinery, aviation, and military.16,20,21 For gas sensors,22,23 compared to
conventional devices graphene has the advantage of maximum surface
area per unit volume because of its ultrathin flake structure only
one atom thick (∼0.34 Å).15 All the carbon atoms in graphene are exposed to the target gas molecules,
which can yield high sensing efficiency.22 Also, even in the limit of few charge carriers, a small amount of
extra electrons can cause a large change in the conductance of graphene
because of its low Johnson noise.24 Last,
graphene devices possess higher conductivity compared with metal oxide-based
gas sensors, so they can be more suitably integrated with actual electronic
circuits.2,23 However, the electrical properties of graphene
are heavily dependent on the synthesis method and quality of lattice.16 In graphene synthesized by the micromechanical
cleavage of graphite, it is difficult to control the thickness and
area of the films, which is unsuitable for mass production.25 Epitaxial graphene can be used to prepare graphene
devices, but its high production cost restricts wide applications.26−29 Graphene oxides or reduced graphene oxide synthesized by chemical
methods usually have poor conductivity.30−32 Chemical vapor deposition
(CVD)-grown graphene has high crystal quality, excellent electronic
properties, and can transfer onto arbitrary substrates,33−35 so it is the best candidate material for fabricating graphene devices
compared with other methods.

Herein, we report the fabrication
of miniature gas sensor arrays
based on transferred CVD-grown graphene to detect NO2 gas
at room temperature. The sensing performance, including responsivity,
recovery time, detection limit, repeatability, thermal stability,
and selectivity were measured and discussed. Initially, the as-prepared
gas sensors exhibited weak response and incomplete recovery in dark
conditions. As previously reported, the UV irradiation is a feasible
means to improve the sensing performance.36−39 Then, we tested assisting the
gas sensor with UV irradiation at room temperature. With the UV irradiation,
the gas sensor has a high response (26% change in resistance) to nitrogen
dioxide at 100 ppm, a sevenfold improvement over the dark condition,
and this response has a monotonic relationship with gas concentration
that can be modeled with piecewise linear functions. In addition,
excellent repeatability and weak temperature dependence were observed.
These miniature gas sensor arrays have simple fabrication processes
and they can be used in the field of low-concentration nitrogen dioxide
detection for real-time environment monitoring.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the Graphene-Based Sensor
The graphene-based
sensor arrays were fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate
as shown in Figure 1a. The details of the process were described in the Experimental Section. The mesoscopic morphology of the graphene-based
sensors was characterized as shown in Figure 2. The optical image of graphene-based sensors
array on the SiO2/Si substrate is shown in Figure 2a. This array has seven gas
sensor devices with a shared electrode. Figure 2b shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of an individual gas sensor device. Both length and width
of the channel are almost 10 μm. Figure 2c shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM)
image of the patterned graphene surface. The patterned graphene films
with clean surfaces, being a key for high sensitivity, eliminated
the influence of contamination and impurities.33

transfer curve exhibited an ambipolar behavior with a charge neutral
point near VG ≈ 5 V. The inset

and Fermi level-dependent charge carrier concentration. p-type doping
can create hole-like charge carriers.

Raman spectroscopy measurements were used to indentify the crystal
quality of the transferred CVD-grown graphene and to analyze potential
damage introduced through impurities or edge defects.40−42 The Raman spectra were obtained using an Andor system with a 532
nm laser. Figure 2d
shows the Raman spectrum of the patterned graphene. The Raman spectrum
showed typical G peak around ∼1583 cm–1.
The 2D peaks at ∼2679 cm–1 with a full width
at half maximum of 31.7 cm–1. The 2D/G intensity
ratio was about 2.2, which indicated the patterned graphene is a monolayer.35,43 In addition, the patterned graphene exhibited an additional D peak
at ∼1350 cm–1, which was ascribed to generated
edges or defects during the patterning or transfer processes.35,44,45

Electrical transport properties
of the graphene-based sensor were
measured at room temperature via four-probe station. Figure 2e shows the current–voltage
(I–V) curves of the graphene-based
sensor applying different gate voltages. The linear ohmic behaviors
of I–V curves indicate the
high electrical conductivity in our graphene-based sensor for gas-sensing
experiments. The current–gate voltage (I–VG) transfer curve shows an ambipolar behavior
with the charge neutral point at VG ≈
5 V, as shown in Figure 2f. The n-type silicon substrate was used as the gate electrode. It
indicates a slightly p-type doping in the transferred graphene, which
is derived from the adsorption of oxygen and water vapor onto the
surface of graphene in the atmosphere during the testing process.46,47

NO2 Gas Sensing Properties of the Graphene-Based
Sensor
As previously reported, graphene-based materials demonstrated
tremendous potential for detecting small-molecule gases, for example,
NO2, NH3, CO2, H2O, and
SO2.48−57 Herein, the gas-sensing performance of graphene sensor arrays were
detected by choosing NO2 as the target gas at room temperature.
The sensing performance test used a home-made measurement system,
as shown in Figure 1b. The details of parameters were described in the Experimental Section.

The response of the sensor is
defined as 1  where R0 and Rg are the sensor resistances
before and after
the exposure to NO2, respectively. The response time is
defined as the time taken for the sensor to achieve 90% of its maximum
resistance change, and the recovery time is the time for the resistance
to go down to 10% of the maximum resistance change.58−60

Fast
response and complete recovery are essential to realize high-performance
NO2 gas sensors.9Figure 3a shows schematic illustration
of the graphene-based sensor in a complex atmosphere containing nitrogen
dioxide. Figure 3b
displays the response and recovery curves of the graphene sensor exposed
to 100 ppm concentration of NO2 gas at room temperature
toward different conditions. The electrical resistance of the sensor
with graphene-sensing layer decreases upon NO2 molecular
adsorption. The electrons transfer from graphene to NO2 molecule as an electron acceptor.23 As
given in Figure 3b,
the graphene-based sensor in the dark condition not only has low response
but is also extremely difficult to recover. To improve the response
and recovery characteristics, the sensor was irradiated with UV light.61,62 The UV source parameters such as wavelength and irradiance will
affect the improvement of sensing performance.63 Therefore, the effects of different light wavelengths and
irradiance on the sensing performance were systematically investigated. Figure S1 shows the response and recovery curves
of the graphene-based sensor exposed to NO2 under the different
light wavelengths. The response and recovery rate were accelerated
with decreasing light wavelength. After that, the effects of light
(265 nm) irradiance in the range of 0.5–1.7 mW/cm2 on the response and recovery of the graphene-based sensor for NO2 is shown in Figure S2. There is
a maximum response under irradiance of 1.21 mW/cm2, but
the recovery was lower than that of 1.68 mW/cm2. For best
imporvement, the optimum wavelength (265 nm) and irradiance (1.68
mW/cm2) were selected for the following studies. As the
red line shown in Figure 3b, the graphene-based sensor under UV irradiation after the
NO2 gas was injected for 200 s, resulted in the maximum
response of 26%, which is more than sevenfold that of the graphene
sensor in dark conditions. Meanwhile, the recovery time was drastically
decreased with UV irradiation, compared to dark conditions. The effect
of UV irradiation on the response of the gas sensors can be attributed
to the cleaning of the graphene surface. Thus, the available active
sites will be occupied by nitrogen dioxide molecules.64−66 Simultaneously, the UV irradiation can effectively separate charge
carriers at the graphene surface for recovery. As previously reported,
the use of UV irradiation was designed to avoid damage of the sensor
by controlling the intensity and the wavelength of the UV light.67

Figure 3 (a) schematic illustration of the sensor based on CVD
graphene
in the atmosphere containing nitrogen dioxide. (b) response and recovery
curves of relative resistance changes of the graphene sensors exposed
to 100 ppm concentration of NO2 gas with and without UV
irradiation.

Based on the abovementioned measurements,
the effect of UV light
on the correlation between sensing response and concentration was
investigated. Figure 4 reveals the real-time response of the graphene sensor with and without
UV irradiation measured at different concentrations of NO2 gas. The response performance of the sensor varied with the changes
in the NO2 concentration from 2 to 150 ppm (Figure 4a). Figure 4b gives the enlarged response at low NO2 concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 ppm, respectively (dashed line
in Figure 4a). It is
of interest to note that the graphene sensor in the dark condition
was unable to visibly detect 2 ppm NO2, and the response
value only made 0.1%. For comparison, the graphene sensor exposed
to NO2 concentrations from 1 to 150 ppm under UV irradiation
at room temperature (Figure 4c). Additionally, the extremely low concentration of sub-ppm
NO2 gas was clearly detectable using UV irradiation.10 In other words, the graphene-based sensor assisted
by UV light has much lower detection limit. Figure 4d indicates that the sensing response of
the UV-assisted graphene sensor monotonously increases with NO2 concentrations from 1 to 150 ppm. The plots display a linear
behavior below 20 ppm corresponding to high-sensitive mode in relatively
low-concentration range of NO2. When the NO2 concentration is high enough, the response converts to a different
linear dependence with lower slope on concentration, which terms as
the low-sensitive mode.68 There are two
explanations for the change in the above slope. One of the views is
the lower slope of higher NO2 concentration caused by the
sensor partial saturation, which leads to the response diverged from
pervious linearity.69−72 Another view is that this conversion derives from the enhancement
of scattering events between adsorbed NO2 molecules and
charge carriers. At the relatively low NO2 concentration
range, the adsorption sites for NO2 are sufficient to respond
with high sensitivity, and NO2 molecule adsorption is too
rare to affect charge-transport motions. While a great deal of the
adsorption sites for the NO2 molecule are filled at the
relatively high NO2 concentration range, the scattering
effects of the adsorbed NO2 molecules emerge, resulting
in adsorption rate of NO2 molecules turning out to be lower
than that of high-sensitive mode and the increase rate of response
becoming smaller.68 From these fitted curves,
the response of the graphene sensor for any concentration can calculated
a consistent value. According to the IUPAC definition, the signal
to noise ratio should be higher than 3.73 By the reported calculation method,74 the detection limit is estimated to be 42.18 ppb, which is much
lower than that in the dark condition (see Figure 4b).

sensor in
NO2 concentration modulated from 2 to 140 ppm in dark conditions.
(b) Response and recovery curves of the graphene-based sensor at NO2 concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 ppm, respectively, in dark
conditions. (c) Response and recovery curves of the graphene-based
sensor in different NO2 concentration (modulated from 1
to 150 ppm) under UV irradiation. (d) Fit curves of the response value
as a function of NO2 concentration at room temperature

The recovery of the graphene-based
sensor was studied as a function
of temperature, which could be changed using the adjustable temperature
sample holder. As shown in Figure 5a, the response of graphene-based sensor in the dark
condition decreases when temperature increases from 25 to 100 °C,
but obtained a faster response rate. At the same time, the recovery
time also decreased. It can be explained by the following two factors.
First, few NO2 gas molecules are adsorbed on the graphene
surface at high temperature, so the response of the sensor decreased.58 Second, high temperature will accelerate the
desorption of NO2 gas molecules from the graphene surface,
which results in the decrease of the recovery time.58Figure 5b shows the graphene-based sensor exposed to 100 ppm NO2 under UV irradiation at different operating temperatures from 25
to 100 °C. The fluctuations of temperature have less effect on
the sensing performance under UV irradiation. It indicates that the
UV-assisted sensor has better thermal stability than in the dark conditions.

stability tests of the graphene-based sensor exposed to
NO2 concentrations of 100 ppm at room temperature in (a)
dark and (b) UV irradiation.

The repeatability of the graphene-based sensor was also investigated
by in situ cyclic sensing tests of the graphene-based sensor upon
repeated 100 ppm NO2 exposure and removal. Figure 6a shows the response and recovery
curves with five-cycle exposure to 100 ppm NO2 gas in different
conditions. It was observed that the graphene-based sensor under UV
irradiation has better repeatability than that in dark conditions.
Meanwhile, the response of the UV-assisted graphene sensor has a slight
decline (2%) in time of two months (Figure 6b). It means that the good durability and
reliability of developing UV-assisted graphene sensors for practical
application.

the graphene-based
sensor exposed to NO2 concentrations of 100 ppm at room

under different light conditions. (d) Response and recovery curves
of the graphene-based sensor exposed to NH3, CO, and H2 concentrations of 100 ppm under different light conditions.

The selectivity of graphene-based sensors which
can accurately
detect the target gas among other gases is essential characteristic
for performance estimation of gas sensors.2,11,75 To investigate the selectivity of the NO2 gas sensor under different conditions, the response of the
graphene-based sensor was characterized toward different target gases
with 100 ppm at room temperature, including ammonia, carbon oxide,
and hydrogen as shown in Figure 6c. Notably, the response toward NO2 is much
higher than NH3, CO, and H2 with the same concentration,
implying a favorable selectivity for NO2 gas detection.
Nevertheless, the selectivity of the graphene-based sensor has not
been obviously improved with UV irradiation, compared to that in dark
condition. Figure 6d shows the response and recovery curves of the graphene-based sensor
exposed to 100 ppm NH3, CO, and H2 under different
light conditions.

Gas-Sensing Mechanism of the Graphene-Based
Sensor
As verified by previous reports, the sensing mechanism
is the charge
transfer due to the relative position in the density of state of the
highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals [highest
occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO)] within adsorbate.51,76 For NO2 adsorbed
on graphene, the LUMO is situated 0.3 eV below the Dirac point of
graphene and independent of adsorption geometry. It demonstrates that
the absorption of NO2 molecules on the graphene surface
is van der Waals interactions.51 Furthermore,
we investigated the gas-sensing mechanisms of the graphene-based sensor
by testing their resistivity changes because of adsorption or desorption
of NO2 gas molecules,22,51,77 which is similar to other solid-state sensors.11,76,78 For the graphene-based sensor
with slightly p-type doping, NO2 molecules as electron
acceptors are adsorbed on the graphene surface. It can result in the
increase of the hole concentrations, leading to the increase conductivity
of the sensing layer.

The effects of UV irradiation can be explained
by two main respects. On the one hand, UV irradiation-induced desorption
of impurity molecules like oxygen or water molecules, then created
a host of adsorption sites on the surface for nitrogen dioxide adsorption.
On the other hand, the luminous energy of UV light (∼4.68 eV)
exceeds the band gap of p-type graphene, the UV irradiation can excite
electron–hole pairs in the p-type graphene-sensing layer. These
additional photogenerated electron transfer from the valence band
to the conduction band,2,64 then participate in the charge
transfer.

Before the gas-sensing test, the graphene-based sensor
was fabricated
in the atmosphere, which unavoidably results in the adsorption of
oxygen molecules on the surface of graphene. There will be two parts
of these adsorbed oxygen molecules. One portion of oxygen molecules
remained physically adsorbed on the graphene surface. The other part
of oxygen molecules serves as an electron-acceptor because of the
oxidizing property. The electrons are attracted to the adsorbed oxygen
molecules, which lead to slightly p-type properties of graphene. The
reaction process can be written as follows79 2  

While the sensor
is exposed to the NO2 gas, electrons
are further transferred from the p-type graphene to the NO2 molecules, as a result of the increase of the hole concentrations
of the graphene-sensing layer according to the following reaction80 3  

When the UV irradiation was applied, the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs appeared in the graphene surface, as shown in the following
reaction64,79 4  

At the same time, photogenerated electrons
can combine with oxygen
molecules, which can form additional photoinduced oxygen ions O2–(hν)64,66,81 5  

Furthermore, a portion of photogenerated
electrons e–(hν) were involved
in the reaction with NO2 molecules, and lead to the larger
p-type doping than in the
dark condition, according to the following reaction66 6  

With the NO2 gas molecules withdrawn, the achieved
balance
in eq 5 is broken. The
photoinduced oxygen ions O2–(hν) will recover to O2 molecules66,82 7  

Hence, the recovered O2 molecules were returned
to its
original state before the NO2 gas injection and then achieved
the repetitive and reversible room-temperature operation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, graphene-based NO2 gas sensor arrays
that operate at room temperature assisted with UV have been prepared.
The graphene-based gas sensor under UV irradiation exhibits high response
for the detection of NO2 gas even at sub-ppm levels, and
the response (26% at 100 ppm) is more than sevenfold than that in
dark conditions. Meanwhile, the graphene-based gas sensor under UV
irradiation has complete recovery, and the recovery time was drastically
decreased. Furthermore, the correlation between NO2 gas
concentrations and response characteristic of the graphene-based gas
sensor was in good agreement with a piecewise linear relation.

The improvement of sensing performance probably can be explained
by several aspects. On the one hand, the UV irradiation provided more
favorable active sites for NO2 gas adsorption. On the other
hand, the UV irradiation enhanced the recovery characteristic of the
sensor because of the desorption rate of NO2 molecules
accelerated by light energy. In addition, the as-prepared gas sensor
also has favorable repeatability, thermal stability, and selectivity.
The UV-assisted sensor can be used in a special atmosphere where concentration
of dangerous gases higher than the lower explosive limit. Hence, the
UV irradiation is a feasible means to improve the sensing performance
of the graphene-based sensor for gas-sensing applications.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis and Transfer of Graphene
The uniform monolayer
graphene was grown on copper foils (25 μm) via atmospheric pressure
CVD with CH4 gas as the carbon source. Before graphene
growth, the copper foils were cleaned by diluted hydrochloric acid.
Then, rinsed by acetone, ethanol, deionized water, and dried by blowing
pure N2. After that, the dry copper foils were loaded into
a CVD system in a horizontal tube furnace with a 2 in. quartz tube.
The system was pumped down to a vacuum of 10–1 Pa
and refilled with pure Ar gas. Then heated to 1050 °C for 60
min. Subsequently, a mixture of diluted methane and hydrogen was introduced
into the CVD system for the graphene growth at 1050 °C with CH4/H2 molar ratio (0.5:50 sccm) under ambient pressure
for 30 min. The growth was terminated with a cooling rate of 25 °C/min
in the ambient environment. The graphene was grown on both sides of
the copper foils. One side of the graphene/copper surface was spin-coated
with PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate). The other side of the copper
foils was exposed to oxygen plasma for 30 s to remove the graphene.
The transfer of graphene films onto the Si substrate with the 285
nm thick thermally grown SiO2 layer was performed by the
wet-etching of the copper substrates. After that, the Cu foils were
etched away using ferric trichloride solution, resulting in the free-standing
PMMA/graphene films floating on the surface of the solution. The PMMA/graphene
films were cleaned by deionized water, and transferred onto the substrate
until they are air dry, then use acetone/acetic acid mixed solution
dissolving PMMA films sequentially. Finally, the substrate was cleaned
with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water.

Fabrication of Graphene
Devices
The graphene-based
sensor arrays were fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate
as shown in Figure 1a. First, photolithography was employed again to pattern the contact
electrode area on graphene transferred onto the Si/SiO2 substrate. Then, the electrodes (10 nm Cr/50 nm Au) were deposited
by e-beam evaporation. Second, photolithography was used to pattern
channels into 10 μm wide strips. Finally, oxygen plasma etching
was used to etch away the redundant graphene. Subsequently, the back
gate was applied to the Si substrate. Before the gassensing measurements,
the sensor array would be connected by a gold wire from the electrodes
to the chip carrier via ultrasonic wire bonder.

Gas-Sensing
Performance Evaluation
For gas-sensing
experiments, we have constructed a home-built measuring system with
electrical feedthrough, adjustable temperature sample holder (from
room temperature to 150 °C), and UV-LED as shown in Figure 1b. The measurements
were performed under atmospheric pressure at controlled temperature
(23 ± 2 to 100 °C). To measure the sensing performance,
the gas flow was a constant of 1000 sccm (standard cubic centimeter
per minute). Various concentrations of target gas were injected into
the test chamber by adjusting the flow ratio of target gas to dry
N2 using the mass flow controller. Dry N2 was
separately injected into the chamber for measuring the recovery of
the sensor. The UV light is used to investigate the effect of ultraviolet
light on sensing performance. The applied bias voltage was fixed at
100 mV during the testing process. The electrical measurements were
carried out using a high-sensitivity SourceMeter (Keithley 2450),
which is connected with computer for signal collection.
