One of the primary
challenges in explosive detection using fluorescence
quenching is the identification and quantification of detected targets.
In this work, we explore the reliability of aerosol jet printed sensor
arrays for the discrimination of nitroaromatic traces using linear
discriminant analysis (LDA). We varied the amount of the deposited
material by controlling the printer’s shutter to investigate
the impact on the detection reliability. For a twofold variation of
the amount of the deposited material, we report excellent classification
rates between 81 and 96% for the discrimination of nitrobenzene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene,
and 2,4-dinitrotoluene at 1, 3, and 10 parts per billion in air, respectively.
Our results close to the detection limits indicate a remarkable identification
and quantification of explosive trace vapors because of high control
of the printing process. This work demonstrates the high potential
of digitally printed fluorescence quenching sensor arrays and the
excellent capabilities of LDA as a simple supervised statistical learning
technique.

Introduction
The detection of nitroaromatic
explosives has become increasingly
important since terrorist activities raised security concerns worldwide.1−5 To this end, fluorescence quenching transducers offer outstanding
sensitivities.6−10 Among other materials such as dendrimers and metal–organic
frameworks, fluorescent polymers enable the detection of nitroaromatic
vapors at concentrations down to parts per trillion in air.11−19 Therefore, the utilization of fluorescence quenching in sensors
offers the potential to outperform the dog’s nose by almost
3 orders of magnitude.20−23

Moreover, this approach enables the realization of low-cost
systems
because of the detection principle requiring only three technical
components in the simplest case: an excitation source such as an ultraviolet
light-emitting diode (UV-LED), a transducing fluorescent emitter,
and a photodetector. A single-peak fluorophore, however, cannot discriminate
target analytes because of the lack of selectivity in the transduction
mechanisms. In fact, the ability to discriminate targets requires
sensor arrays with several differently sensitive emitters or single
fluorophores with multiple emission peaks to enable the identification
and quantification of multiple target analytes using pattern recognition
techniques.24−33 However, this approach remains challenging because pattern recognition
techniques require intensive training to establish reliable discrimination
models for a certain class of target analytes. Sensor drift and reproducibility
issues make the discrimination of detected target analytes even more
difficult. Therefore, sensor arrays for field applications require
stability and a reproducible, robust, and thus reliable process for
sensor array fabrication.

Previously, we demonstrated the feasibility
of aerosol jet (AJ)
printed fluorescence quenching sensor arrays for the discrimination
of explosive vapors and their reproducible fabrication within a batch.34,35 In this work, we introduce artificially generated fabrication tolerances
to explore the reliability of the printing process even further. To
this end, we vary the printer nozzle’s shutter time in the
AJ printing process to investigate the influence of the amount of
the deposited material on the detection reliability and on the sensor
array reproducibility. The amount of the deposited material has a
direct impact on the sensor array response because of the thickness
dependence of fluorescence quenching. Hence, we have fabricated three
sets of sensor arrays with two- and fourfold variations of the amount
of the deposited material to evaluate their reliability in terms of
discriminatory reproducibility for three nitroaromatic compounds at
parts-per-billion (ppb) concentrations in air.

Experimental Section
Each sample set consists of 12 sensor arrays (4 mm pitch) with
6 different polymer pixels (0.5 mm pitch). Four of the polymers were
received from Merck KGaA including PDY-132 (SY), SPG-01T (PG), SPB-02T
(PB), and SPW-111 (PW). The other two polymers ADS229BE (PFO) and
ADS133YE (F8BT) were purchased from American Dye Source. Each polymer
was dissolved in toluene and tetralin (1:1 by volume) to provide the
ink for the AJ printer that was equipped with a 200 μm nozzle.
Each sample set was printed onto conventional glass substrates that
were pretreated in an oxygen plasma for surface activation. The substrates
were kept at 50 °C during printing to control the drying process.
The printer nozzle was equipped with a shutter to stop material deposition
without stopping the aerosol generation and gas flows. To realize
the three different sets of sensor arrays, the printer nozzle’s
shutter was kept open for 0.5 s (P1), 1 s (P2), and 2 s (P3) for the
deposition of each polymer pixel. In comparison to P1, the amount
of the deposited material for each polymer pixel doubles and quadruples
for P2 and for P3, respectively.

A permeation-based vapor generator
(Dynacalibrator 235, VICI) was
used for the delivery of constant vapor concentrations in a carrier
stream of dry air. Here, the vapors emitted from the permeation tubes
containing nitrobenzene (NB), 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB), and 2,4-dinitrotoluene
(DNT) were used as nitroaromatic target analytes. These compounds
are used in the manufacture of common explosives. Vapor concentrations
of 1, 3, and 10 ppb in air were delivered by dilution of the analyte
carrier flow. The target analytes were used as received from MACHEREY-NAGEL
GmbH & Co. KG. Great care has to be taken when working with these
hazardous compounds because of their carcinogenic, mutagenic, and
reproduction toxic characters. The fluorescence was excited over the
full area of the 26 × 26 mm2 samples with roughly
6 μW using a collimated 365 nm UV-LED (M365L2, Thorlabs). A
charge-coupled device camera (DFK21BU618, The Imaging Source) was
used to measure the average fluorescence intensity as detected by
5 × 5 camera pixels for each polymer structure. The fluorescence
quenching efficiencies (QEs) according to QE = (I0 – I)/I0, with I0 as the intensity in
the absence of a target analyte and I as the intensity
in the presence of it, were averaged over the 12 sensor arrays in
each set using the background-corrected fluorescence intensities.
A drawing of the experimental setup is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Drawing of the experimental
setup showing the permeation-based
vapor delivery and the optical setup for fluorescence quenching detection.

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
was used to assess the discrimination
of the target analytes at different concentrations for each sample
set using Mahalanobis distance-based classifiers. A target class was
defined by the QEs observed for each specific concentration and analyte.
For these classifications, the accuracy rate describes the relative
amount of correctly classified observations when the LDA was trained
with one of the three sample sets, whereas the classes for the data
from the other two sets were predicted. For this purpose, the LDA
input data were standardized. This means that the QEs for each polymer
were scaled to have zero mean and standard deviation equal to one.

The molecular structures of the target analytes, the measurement
sequence for the fluorescence quenching experiments, the normalized
fluorescence signals for each set of sensor arrays, and detailed confusion
matrices for the classification tests are provided in the Supporting Information. The photophysical properties
of the polymers and details on the sample preparation and on the LDA
have been reported elsewhere.34,35

Results and Discussion
Figure 2a–c
shows an image of the three sample sets P1, P2, and P3 under UV illumination.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 2d and the cross sections of the printed polymer
pixels in Figure 2e
reveal a circular structure with a homogeneous plateau in the center
and an outer ring with higher thickness. This type of structure is
a result of the drying ink. The centered plateau serves as the region
of interest (ROI) to measure the fluorescence. An increase in the
nozzle’s shutter time from P1 over P2 to P3 leads to a brighter
appearance of each pixel.

Figure 2 UV-excited sample sets: (a) P1, (b) P2, and
(c) P3 as seen by the
camera. The fluorescence in each array from top to bottom and from
left to right corresponds to SY, PG, PB, PW, PFO, and F8BT. (d) SEM
image of a printed structure including ROI indication. (e) Exemplary
cross sections.

Table 1 shows the
increasing average brightness of each polymer fluorescence for increasing
shutter time. By contrast, we expect a constant brightness because
of the location of the ROIs within the centered plateau whose thickness
is independent of the shutter time. The increasing fluorescence, however,
is a result of the crosstalk from the outer ringlike structures such
that they contribute fluorescence to the ROIs within the centered
plateaus. The outer rings become slightly broader and increase in
height from roughly 200 nm (P1) over 400 nm (P2) up to 500 nm (P3),
as can be seen in Figure 2e.

We performed
long-term illumination experiments to study the optical
degradation in terms of photobleaching. For this purpose, each sample
set resides in a stream of dry air at 1 L/min for a duration of 4
h under a 6 μW illumination power over the full sample area. Figure 3 shows the measured
degradation after 4 h. The high light sensitivity of the camera of
0.05 lx enables the low-power excitation that limits the degradation
after 4 h below 5% on average. Some of the polymers even showed enhanced
emission by a few percent, presumably because of the removal of residues.

with 6 μW across the full sample area for a duration of 4 h
in a stream of dry air at 1 L/min. For each polymer pixel, the error
bars represent the standard deviation across the 12 structures in
each sample set.

We performed fluorescence
quenching experiments in dry air to study
the detection reliability. The sensor array resides in air, followed
by the consecutive delivery of target analytes at 1, 3, and 10 ppb.
We further examined the sensor recovery by purging with dry air after
the vapor exposure. Figure 4 depicts the observed QEs for each polymer per target class
and sample set. Experimental details and sensor array recovery are
given in the Supporting Information.

Figure 4 QE patterns
across the three different sample sets: (a) P1, (b)
P2, and (c) P3. The error bar definition and the polymer order correspond
to that of Figure 3.

The QEs caused by DNT are up to
70% for 10 ppb, followed by up
to almost 40% for 10 ppb DNB and up to 25% for 10 ppb NB. For each
target class, there is a distinct response, that is, a fingerprint
or a pattern. A minimum resolvable QE of 5% yields detection limits
around 1 ppb for DNT and DNB and around 3 ppb for NB. Overall, the
patterns appear similar to each other, and the sensor responses within
each sample set are in good agreement as confirmed by the low QE standard
deviations shown in Table 2. On average, P1 shows the largest standard deviations for
the measured QEs, followed by P2 and P3, which is in line with the
fluorescence appearance.

The application
of a standardized LDA enables the discrimination
of the target classes because of class separation. Figure 5 visualizes the transformed
data, that is, the LDA training models, in two dimensions.

Figure 5 LDA training
models in two dimensions for (a) P1, (b) P2, and (c)
P3. The ellipses represent the 95% confidence intervals for each target
class. The explained variances are given in brackets.

Here, LD1 and LD2 explain about 99% of the data
variability. Visual
inspection of Figure 5 shows that the projections follow similar trajectories for the three
sample sets. P2 and P3 are in good agreement with each other, whereas
P1 seems to deviate slightly. This is particularly the case for NB
and DNB, whereas DNT seems well-projected in P1. To study the reliability
in terms of discriminatory reproducibility, the LDA training model
of each set is used to classify the QE data from the other two sets,
that is, the prediction of the target analyte and its concentration
for each observation. Table 3 shows the accuracy rates for correct classifications without
considering the confidence ellipses. This means, a classification
will be considered valid even if a projected observation with correctly
classified class label is located outside a confidence ellipse.

As expected,
the resubstitution accuracy is 100% for P1, P2, and
P3 as the LDA training models show mostly nonoverlapping target separation
in two dimensions already. The classification comparison of P2 versus
P3 leads to excellent accuracy rates between 84 and 96%, whereas P1
versus P2 shows high reproducibility of 81% but only low reproducibility
between 45 and 61% for P1 versus P3. We attribute the poor reproducibility
in the latter case to the significant differences in the fluorescence
contributions from the outer ringlike structures. This is consistent
with the visual differences in the LDA training models that are most
pronounced between P1 and P3 in Figure 5a,c. A closer investigation of the specific confusion
matrices, given in the Supporting Information, reveals more insights into these findings. The comparison of P1
versus P3 shows that there are no misclassifications for 10 and 3
ppb DNT, which is in line with the visual inspection of the LDA training
models. The prediction of some target classes for P1 versus P3, however,
is of zero accuracy. The comparison of P1 versus P2 shows only few
misclassifications, leading to the reported high accuracy rate of
81%. The comparison of the highly reproducible sets P2 versus P3 with
reported accuracy rates of 84–96% reveals that NB is the primary
source of error in this case. This is in line with the small separation
of the corresponding NB classes in the LDA training models. The prediction
of DNT is of 100% accuracy, and the misclassifications for DNB are
on a negligible scale such that P2 versus P3 shows excellent accuracy.

We attribute the excellent reproducibility of P1 versus P2 and
P2 versus P3, corresponding to a twofold variation of the amount of
the deposited material to the thickness independence in the center
of the printed structures. This implies, however, that P1 versus P3
should be of similar reproducibility with accuracy rates between 81
and 96% because of the location of the ROIs that neglect the outer
ringlike structures. The much poorer reproducibility of P1 versus
P3 with accuracy rates of only 45–61%, however, can be attributed
to the fluorescence contributions from the outer ringlike structures
that become much bigger for a fourfold variation of the amount of
the deposited material. In reality, we would not expect such a strong
variation in the fabrication process. Nevertheless, smaller ROIs in
the centered plateau could be used to reduce the effect of contributions
from the outer rings, but they would increase noise because of a lower
number of pixels within the ROIs. A better solution would be the printing
of larger sensor structures, for example, by the utilization of larger
printer nozzles or by the utilization of a high-resolution camera.
Overall, the accuracy rates remain remarkably high at 81–96%
for a twofold variation of the amount of the deposited material, that
is, P1 versus P2 and P2 versus P3.

Although we have demonstrated
to discriminate trace nitroaromatic
compounds using AJ printed polymeric sensor arrays and their reproducible
and reliable fabrication, field applications require the sensor arrays
to perform in complex matrices containing a series of potential interferents.
Today, this aspect is another major challenge in the field of explosives
detection and will be of future investigation.

Conclusions
We
reported on the reliability in terms of discriminatory reproducibility
of AJ printed fluorescence quenching sensor arrays by investigating
the impact of variations in the amount of the deposited material.
We observed high accuracy rates of more than 81% and up to 96% by
doubling the amount of the deposited material. Thus, the results indicate
a high reliability for the identification and quantification of explosive
trace vapors close to the detection limits of a few ppb only. This
demonstrates the promising potential of AJ printing for the fabrication
of reliable fluorescence quenching sensor arrays. Moreover, the results
underline the excellent capabilities of the LDA as a simple supervised
statistical learning technique for the discrimination of explosive
trace vapors.
