A density
functional theory-based computation has been carried
out to reveal the geometrical and electronic structures of Mg2EP (1), where EP is an extended (3.1.3.1) porphyrinoid
system. EP is a 22 π electronic system and is aromatic in nature.
Here, we have studied the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of
EP2–-supported Mg22+ ion.
The nature of bonding has been studied using natural bond orbital
and atoms in molecule schemes. The presence of a covalent Mg(I)–Mg(I)
σ-bond in Mg2EP is confirmed. The occurrence of a
non-nuclear attractor (NNA) with large electron population, negative
Laplacian of electron density at NNA, and presence of an electron
localization function basin along with large nonlinear optical properties
prompt us to classify Mg2EP as the first porphyrinoid-based
organic electride. Further five small molecules, viz., dihydrogen
(H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and benzene (C6H6), are found to be activated by the electron density between
the two Mg atoms in Mg2EP.

Introduction
Magnesium (Mg) at its
+1 oxidation state in a stable Mg–Mg
bond has been detected in HMgMgH by spectroscopic technique at low-temperature
gas matrices.1,2 However, a complete laboratory
synthesis of stable Mg(I)–Mg(I) bonded complexes was reported
by Green et al. in 2007.3 This work reported
the syntheses of {Mg(DippPriso)}2 (DippPriso = [(DippN)2CNiPr2], Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, iPr = iso-propyl) and {Mg(DippNacnac)}2 (DippNacnac = [(Dipp)NC(Me)]2CH) complexes,
where a Mg(I)–Mg(I) σ-bond is confirmed by computational
studies. After this work, stabilizing Mg atoms at the +1 oxidation
state became a state-of-the-art research arena for chemists. The common
synthetic strategy involved is to design and synthesize bulky ligands
that can stabilize Mg22+ entity in its cavity.
A large number of complexes with stable Mg(I)–Mg(I) σ-bond
have been synthesized by experimentalists, and computational studies
have been carried out by theoreticians to predict such stable complexes.4−6

Porphyrins are one of the important classes of macrocycles,
where
four pyrrole units are connected alternately through methine (=CH−)
linkers.7 The 18 conjugated π-electrons
((4n + 2) π-electrons; n =
4) present in the porphyrins make it highly aromatic.8−11 The deprotonated free base porphyrins can form complexes with metal
atoms; they are known as metalloporphyrins, which are fundamental
units of a number of biomolecules without which life on this earth
cannot survive.12,13 The core of the porphyrin has
been extended and stretched using bridging atoms.14−17 These modified porphyrinoid cores
have strong red-shifted UV–vis absorption that has potential
applications in photochemistry as photosensitizers.18,19 The stretched porphyrinoid cores can be used as ligands for the
generation of unusual metalloderivatives.20 In 1990, [22]octaethylporphyrin(3.1.3.1) has been synthesized where
the inner ring of the porphyrin unit has been extended by four carbon
atoms.16,18 This extended porphyrin has 22 π-electrons
(follows Hückel’s (4n + 2) rule, n = 5) and hence is aromatic in nature.17

Here, the extended (3.1.3.1) porphyrin (without any
substitution,
denoted EP), H2EP, has been considered as a ligand that
can stabilize Mg22+ ion in Mg2EP
as shown in Scheme 1a. The binding modes of the “Nacnac” ligand can be
mimicked by the EP2–; see Scheme 1b. In the {Mg(Nacnac)}2 complex,
the two ligands are not connected and oriented almost perpendicular
to each other.3 However, the EP2– is planar and cyclic. So, it will be interesting to study the Mg2EP complex and explore its nature of bonding and other properties.

and EP2– Ligands
Electrides are a class of ionic compounds that have trapped
electrons
as anions. These loosely bound electrons in electrides result in high
nonlinear optical (NLO) properties21,22 and accordingly
are useful as in reversible H2 storage material,23 in electron emitter,24 and in activation of small molecules.25,26 In 1983, Dye
et al. synthesized the first crystalline organic electride, Cs+(18-crown-6)2e–,27 which influenced them to synthesize a series of such compounds.28 In 2005, Na+(tri-pip-aza-2.2.2)e– was synthesized by Redko et al.29 The first synthesized crystalline inorganic electride is
[Ca24Al28O64]4+·(4e–), where the unit cell vacancies hold the trapped electrons.30 The stability and hence the practical applications
of electrides depend on their sensitivity toward air and temperature.31

Density functional theory (DFT)-based
computations have been performed
and thermodynamic parameters have been calculated to check the stability
of the Mg2EP complex. Complete bonding analyses have been
performed with the help of natural bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in
molecules (AIM) schemes. The kinetic stability of the complex has
also been studied using the ab initio molecular dynamics. The bowl
inversion of the central “Mg2N4H2” unit has been observed. Furthermore, the electride
property of Mg2EP has been elucidated. Small molecules
like H2, CO2, N2O, CH4, and C6H6 are found to be activated followed
by dissociation of H–H, C–O, N–O, aliphatic C–H,
and aromatic C–H bonds, respectively, by the Mg2EP. Stable complexes are formed with bridging ligands between the
two Mg atoms.

Computational Details
The geometry
optimizations in this study have been performed at
the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p)32−34 level of theory. Frequency calculations
are also carried out at the same computational level to ensure that
the optimized structures are at the minima on their respective potential
energy surfaces. The M06-2X functional is well known for its wide
and accurate predictive applications involving main group thermochemistry.35 The dynamical behavior of the Mg2EP has been studied using an atom-centered density matrix propagation
(ADMP)36−38 technique. In this ADMP simulation, we have evolved
the optimized Mg2EP at 298 and 500 K temperatures at 1
atm pressure. We have simulated the Mg2EP system over a
total time length of 1 ps with 2 fs time interval. We have used the
Gaussian 16 program package for the calculations.39

The natural population analysis40 is
carried out to get natural charges on the atoms, and the Wiberg bond
indices (WBIs)41 are computed to obtain
the bond order between any atomic pair using the natural bond orbital
(NBO)42 scheme at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p)
level of theory. We have also compared the NBO results of Mg2EP at the M06-2X-D3 level with that obtained at the MP243/Aug-cc-pVTZ44,45/Aug-cc-pVDZ//M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p)
level of theory (denoted MP2/aV(D+T)Z), where Aug-cc-pVTZ is used
for the Mg and N atoms and Aug-cc-pVDZ basis sets are used for the
C and H atoms, respectively. The NBO analysis has been carried out
using NBO 3.146 as implemented in Gaussian
16.

The topological descriptors of the electron density47 have been computed at DFT and MP2 levels with
the help of Multiwfn software.48 Basin
analyses based on the electron density (ρ(r)) and the electron localization function (ELF)49,50 have been performed. The localization index (λ) and delocalization
index (δ) based on the ELF basin have been computed.51−54 It is termed as “basin” following these references.

Average linear polarizability (α̅), first hyperpolarizability
(β), and second hyperpolarizability (γ∥) were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)/6-31+G level, where the
6-31+G(d) basis set is used for Mg atoms and the 6-31+G basis set
is used for all other atoms. We have used the following equations
to calculate α̅, β, and γ∥55,56      The activation of small molecules followed
by dissociation using the Mg2EP has been studied at the
M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) level at the gas phase. The intermediates and
the transition states (TS) are optimized along with the frequency
calculations. The complete intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations
taking each TS have been carried out connecting the respective minima.
The Gibbs’ free energy changes have been calculated, and the
complete reaction profiles have been generated. The NBO analyses at
each minimum and TS have been performed to get the natural charge
and WBI values.

Results and Discussion
Structure and Energetics
The minimum energy geometry
of Mg2EP (1) at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p)
level has been presented in Figure 1. The optimized geometry of 1 is nonplanar
and found to be in the C2v point group of symmetry. The Mg–Mg bond length in 1 is 2.787 Å. Pyykkö et al.57 have predicted the Mg–Mg single bond length to be 2.780 Å,
which is in good agreement with our computed value. The four Mg–N
bond lengths are equal in 1, and it is 2.062 Å.
We have also optimized the geometry of 1 at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level. The rMg–Mg and rMg–N are found to be 2.792 and 2.075 Å, respectively.
Thus, we can say that the result is not an artifact of using a particular
computational level. The four N atoms of the EP2– ligand in 1 form a rectangle (denoted N4-plane), and
the two Mg atoms are above that plane and in the same side of this
N4-plane. The distance between the center of two Mg atoms and the
center of the N4-plane is 0.661 Å at M06-2X-D3 and 0.672 Å
at B3LYP levels. Scheme 1 has been considered to find out the thermochemical stability of 1 at 298 K temperature and 1 atm pressure. The Gibbs’
free energy change (ΔG1) for the
formation of 1 is −83.9 kcal/mol, which indicates
that the formation of 1 is a thermochemically favorable
process (see Scheme 1a). Further, the dissociation of 1 into Mg22+ and EP2– fragments is thermochemically
nonspontaneous as ΔG2 is 515.9 kcal/mol.

Figure 1 Optimized
geometry of Mg2EP at the minimum energy (1) and at the transition state (TS1–1) computed at M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) and B3LYP/6-311++(d,p)
levels. The unit of the bond lengths is in Å. The values without
and within parenthesis are computed at M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) and
B3LYP/6-311++(d,p) levels, respectively.

A planar transition state (TS1–1) has been identified and optimized corresponding to the inversion
of the two Mg atoms with respect to the N4-plane in 1. The point group symmetry of TS1–1 is C2h. The Mg–Mg
distance in TS1–1 is 2.652
Å at M06-2X-D3 and 2.664 Å at B3LYP levels. The imaginary
frequency is 148i (137i) cm–1 at the M06-2X-D3 (B3LYP) level. All four Mg–N
bond lengths are equal to each other, and it is 2.026 (2.039) Å
at the M06-2X-D3 (B3LYP) level. Geometry 1 goes through
this TS1–1, and the Mg2N4H2 unit gets inverted, that is, the two Mg atoms
(and two H atoms of the opposite side of the N4-plane) go to the other
side of the N4-plane through the planar TS1–1 akin to that in NH3 inversion.
The Gibbs’ free energy barrier (ΔG)
for the inversion of the Mg2N4H2 unit
is found to be 5.8 (5.2) kcal/mol at the M06-2X-D3 (B3LYP) level. Figure 2a represents a complete
“bell-shaped” IRC path that connects the two conformers
of 1 and TS1–1.

energy against time, (c) change in the rMg–Mg and rMg–N bond lengths with respect
to the optimized 1 (t = 0) against time,
and (d) dMg and dH against time at 298 and 500 K.

The ab initio molecular dynamics study has been performed
to reveal
the dynamical behavior of 1. The optimized Mg2EP has been simulated to evolve using the ADMP method over 2 ps of
time at 298 and 500 K temperatures. The time evolution of the total
energy at both the temperatures is shown in Figure 2b. The total energy at 500 K temperature
is higher than that at 298 K, as expected. The oscillations in the
energy curves have been observed at both the temperatures. This may
be due to an increase in the nuclear kinetic energy changes arising
out of the structural deformations of 1. The changes
in the Mg–Mg (Δr(Mg–Mg), Å)
and Mg–N (Δr(Mg–N), Å) bond
lengths with respect to their optimized values in 1 (i.e.,
geometry at t = 0) against time have been plotted.
To keep track of the dynamics, two Mg atoms and four N atoms have
been marked as shown in Figure S1a. The
plots in Figures 2c
and S1b show that Mg–Mg and four
Mg–N bond lengths fluctuate around their optimized values all
throughout the simulations at both the temperatures, but they do not
disintegrate. These two observations reveal the kinetic stability
of the Mg2EP. The inversion of the central Mg2N4H2 unit at 500 K may be clearly understood
from the plots in Figure 2d. Here, we have calculated the dMg (dMg = distances between the center
of the two Mg atoms and the center of the four N atoms, with proper
sign) and dH (dH = distances between the center of the two H atoms and the center
of the four N atoms, with proper sign) at both the temperatures throughout
the overall simulation and plotted it against time. The plot clearly
shows an inversion of the dMg and dH, which indicates the inversion of the two
Mg and two H atoms at 500 K, but it is not the case at 298 K. The
nuclear kinetic energy is not enough at 298 K to flip the Mg2N4H2 unit. The snapshots of the geometries
at different time points at both of the temperatures have been presented
in Figure 3. Movie
files of the ADMP results at 298 and 500 K have also been presented
in the Supporting Information, which clearly
portray the inversion dynamics and the role played by the nuclear
kinetic energy therein.

Nature of Bonding in 1
Molecular Orbital (MO) Diagram
Molecular
orbital analysis
has been carried out on 1 at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p)
level. The shapes and energies of highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) have been presented
in Figure 4. The shape
of the LUMO represents a π-orbital, distributed over the EP2– ligand. The HOMO – 1 represents the Mg–Mg
σ bond. The 3s and 3p atomic orbitals on each Mg atom are the
major contributors, and they contribute 26.0 and 15.4%, respectively,
toward the formation of the Mg–Mg σ bond. The contribution
from other atoms toward HOMO is less than 5%. The energy difference
between the HOMO and the LUMO is 3.18 eV.

M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. The values in the parentheses
are energies of the corresponding orbitals in eV.

Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) Analysis
The natural charge
on the Mg and N atoms and the Wiberg bond index (WBI) values for the
Mg–Mg and Mg–N bonds in 1 at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p)
level are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Natural Charges (q, |e|)
on Mg and N Atoms; Wiberg Bond Indices (WBIs) for the Mg–Mg
and Mg–N Bonds in 1a

Mg2EP	1.01 (1.01)	–0.80 (−0.88)	0.647 (0.709)	0.081 (0.067)	
a The values without and within parenthesis
represent the results obtained at M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) and MP2/av(D+T)z
levels, respectively.

The
natural charges on each of the Mg and N atoms are 1.01 and
−0.80 |e|, respectively. The WBI value for the Mg–Mg
bond is 0.647, which suggests the presence of a single bond between
the two Mg atoms. The WBI value for the Mg–N bonds is 0.081
in Mg2EP, suggesting that the interaction between the Mg
and N atoms is noncovalent in nature. The NBO results at the MP2 level
also support the same arguments. The Mg–Mg bond orbital has
been generated at the MP2 level and is shown in Figure S2. The occupancy of Mg–Mg bond orbital is 1.79
|e|. The atomic orbital contributions from the two Mg atoms are equal,
indicating that the Mg–Mg bond is nonpolar in nature. The contributions
from the 3s and 3p atomic orbitals are 92.1 and 5.9%, respectively,
toward the Mg–Mg bond orbital, whereas the 3d orbital contributes
only 1.6%.

Electron Density Analysis
Different
topological parameters
based on the electron density at relevant critical points (CPs) of 1 have been computed at both MP2 and DFT levels and are presented
in Table 2. The molecular
graph of the Mg2EP is shown in Figure 5a. The molecular graph at the MP2 and DFT
methods are the same. A non-nuclear attractor (NNA; (3, −3)-type
critical point) has been located close to the middle of the two Mg
atoms. The presence of NNA in dimeric Mg(I) complexes has been confirmed
experimentally.58 The electron density
(ρ(rc)) at this NNA is 0.034 au
at the MP2 level. The Laplacian of electron density (∇2ρ(rc)) at the NNA is −0.043
au. The negative ∇2ρ(rc) indicates the electron accumulation between the two Mg atoms.
The population of the NNA basin is 1.03 electrons with 46% of localization.
Two NNA–Mg bond paths are found, connecting the NNA and the
two Mg atoms. The ρ(rc) values at
the NNA–Mg bond critical points (BCPs) are 0.032 au and the
∇2ρ(rc) values
are 0.009 au. The energy density (H(rc)) values are negative. The DFT-level calculations have
predicted almost similar results. Figure 5b,c shows a distinct region between the two
Mg atoms where electron density is accumulated. An ELF basin between
the two Mg atoms, C(NNA), is identified (see Figure 5d,e) with a population of 1.78 electron in
it with 61% localization at MP2/aV(D+T)Z level of theory.
On the basis of these results, we can say that there is a considerable
amount of degree of covalency in the bond between the two Mg atoms.
The positive ∇2ρ(rc) and H(rc) and low
δ values indicate that the Mg–N interactions are noncovalent
in nature. Two NNA–H bond paths have been found. The low ρ(rc) and positive ∇2ρ(rc) and H(rc) values suggest that the interaction is weak. Low δ
value at the NNA–H BCP further supports this argument.

Nonlinear Optical (NLO) Property of 1
Average
linear polarizability (α̅), first hyperpolarizability
(β), and second hyperpolarizability (γ∥) have been calculated for 1 and are presented in Table S1. The α̅, β, and γ∥ values are 493.7, 3.62 × 102, and
1.1 × 105 au, respectively. Further, we have compared
the α̅, β, and γ∥ values
of 1 with the corresponding previously reported values
for Li@Calix, Na@Calix, Li@B10H14, Li2(TCNQ), and Na2(TCNQ).56 The
results show that Mg2EP has the largest α̅
value among all of them. However, the β and γ∥ values of 1 are smaller as compared to those in the
other systems, albeit sufficiently high. Thus, 1 can
be treated as an NLO material.

Electride Property of 1
Classification
of a molecule as an electride is based on several properties, viz.,
large nonlinear optical properties,50,56,59,60 presence of a non-nuclear
attractor (NNA)50 of the electron density,
electron localization function (ELF) basins,50,61−64 and noncovalent index (NCI),62,64,65 which have to be computed by reliable and sophisticated methods.
The AIM results have confirmed the presence of an NNA with a negative
∇2ρ(r) value, with a large
electron population in it (see Table 2). The ELF analysis showed that the C(NNA) has 1.78
electron population with 61% localization in it. The high polarizability
and first and second hyper polarizabilities also suggest the NLO behavior
of 1. The green region in the NCI plot (see Figure S3) shows the electron localization between
the two Mg atoms in 1. All these results strongly establish
that 1 can be classified as an organic electride, and
it is the first electride having a porphyrinoid moiety.

Activation
of Small Molecules
Activation and dissociation
of small gas molecules, especially greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide
(CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), have been considered
to be the need of the hour. This provides a two-pronged benefit, viz.,
it can remove the hazardous global warming gases and it provides chemical
precursors to various chemical reactions. Activation of the C–H
bonds in organic molecules is one of the most challenging jobs for
chemists. Finding cheap, selective, and efficient catalysts that can
activate and eventually dissociate both aliphatic and aromatic C–H
bonds has been considered to be a great challenge. Electrides are
found to activate small molecules like CO2 and N2, and they have been used for reversible storage of molecular dihydrogen
(H2).23,66 Here, we have studied the activation
followed by dissociation of five small molecules, viz., H–H
bond in H2, C–O bond in CO2, N–O
bond in N2O, and C–H bond in methane (CH4) and benzene (C6H6) molecules using Mg2EP, as shown in Scheme 2.

Mechanistic Investigation of H2 Reactivity
Direct hydrogenation of dimeric Mg(I) complexes
has not been achieved
experimentally till now.67 The kinetic
stability of Mg(I) dimer is suggested as the possible reason for the
inertness of these complexes.68 Computations
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level have shown that the hydrogenation of guanidinate-supported
Mg22+ complexes producing the corresponding
bridged hydrido (μ-H) complexes are exothermic in nature (ΔH ≈ −24 kcal/mol).69 An indirect hydrogenation process for the Mg(I) dimers,
using aluminum(III) hydride has been achieved.70 Complex 1 has been subjected to hydrogenation,
which leads to the product Mg2EP(μ-H)2 (denoted 4, in Figure 6). The hydrogenation process is exothermic by ΔH = −33.4 kcal/mol and exergonic by ΔG = −25.1 kcal/mol. Thus, the hydrogenation process
is thermochemically spontaneous. The hydrogenation of 1 is found to be a stepwise process, and the complete reaction path
is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Relative free energy (in kcal/mol) profile for H2 activation
by 1 calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) level of
theory. The sum of the Gibbs’ free energies of 1 and H2 (−1544.39913162 au) is considered as 0.0
kcal/mol.

At the early step of the reaction, 1 forms a prereaction
complex, 2, with one H2 molecule. Then, it
generates a transition state, TS2–3, where the Gibbs’ free energy barrier is 31.8 kcal/mol
with respect to 2. The H–H bond length in the
free H2 molecule is 0.740 Å (see Figure S4), which is increased by 0.006 Å in 2, which further increased to 1.124 Å in TS2–3 (see Table S2). Then, the structure TS2–3 moves to the intermediate 3, where the H–H
bond is completely dissociated (rH–H = 2.940 Å). One H atom is bonded to two Mg atoms, forming a
hydrido bridge, whereas another is only bound to one Mg atom in 3. Structure 3 is stabilized by −1.4 kcal/mol
of Gibbs’ free energy as compared to that of 1 and one H2 molecule. But, it then reorganizes itself
toward a more stable geometry, 4. The bridged H atom
moves inward to the N4-plane. Another TS3–4 is formed, which has 2.9 kcal/mol more free energy than 3. The structural parameters of 3 and TS3–4 are almost similar, except the
bent of the μ-H. The bent of the μ-H in 3 is outward, which becomes inward in TS3–4. At last, it forms the final product 4 with a
total gain in free energy of −25.1 kcal/mol. The HOMO of TS2–3 corresponds to the interaction
between the Mg–Mg σ-bond orbital of 1 and
the σ*-orbital of the H2 molecule (see Figure S5). The activation of the H2 molecule is indicated by the elongated H–H bond length in TS2–3. The charges on the H
atoms of H2 molecules are −0.36 and −0.48
|e| (see Table S2), making a total of −0.84 |e| electronic
charge on the H2 molecule in TS2–3. This indicates a transfer of electron density
from 1 to the H2 molecule. The WBIH–H values are 1.000 in free H2, which is decreased to 0.294
in TS2–3; this indicates
the weakening of the H–H bond by the population of the σ*-orbital
of the H2 molecule. In 3, the H2 molecule is completely dissociated, and WBIH–H is 0.008 only. Structure 4 has two hydrides bridged
between the two Mg atoms. The Mg–H bond lengths are 1.855 and
1.850 Å. The Mg–Mg distance in 4 is 2.665
Å, which is smaller than that in 1.

Mechanistic
Investigation of CO2 Reactivity
Previous studies
have shown that LMgMgL type of complexes can effectively
activate and dissociate CO2, forming an oxo-bridged (μ-O)
complex, which finally gives a carbonate complex.71−73 System 1 effectively activate and split CO2 and form
an oxo-bridged (μ-O) complex (9) and CO. Then, 9 further bind to another CO2 molecule to
finally produce a carbonate complex 11. The complete
reaction path is presented in Figure 7. One CO2 molecule first binds to 1 and forms a complex 5; the ΔG for this adduct formation is only 0.1 kcal/mol. Then, TS5–6 is formed with a gain in the free
energy value of 5.8 kcal/mol. A similar type of TS having almost an
equal energy barrier has been identified earlier, where the Mg atoms
were stabilized using tripodal diimine-enolate ligands.72 The C–O bonds are elongated to have bond
lengths of 1.189 and 1.157 Å, and the ∠OCO became bent
to 161.7°.

Figure 7 Relative free energy (in kcal/mol) profile for CO2 activation
by 1 calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) level of
theory. The sum of the Gibbs’ free energies of 1 and CO2 (−1731.80561006 au) is considered as 0.0
kcal/mol.

The TS5–6 transforms
to a symmetric intermediate 6, which is stabilized by
−30.6 kcal/mol. The activation of CO2 requires a
transformation from a linear to a bent geometry.74 The ∠OCO is 125.1°, and the rC–O is 1.269 Å. The bent ∠OCO indicates
the presence of activated CO2 in TS5–6 and 6. The HOMO of TS5–6 corresponds to the interaction
between the Mg–Mg σ-bond orbital (HOMO) of the Mg2EP and the LUMO of the CO2 molecule (see Figure
S5). The total charge on the CO2 fragment in TS5–6 is −0.67 |e|. Thus, the
flow of electron density from 1 to the CO2 molecule is confirmed. The total charge in the CO2 fragment
is −1.56 |e| in 6. The main contribution to HOMO
– 2 of 6 came from HOMO of CO22– (see Figure S6). The WBIMg–Mg value is decreased to 0.517 in TS5–6 and to 0.016 in 6 as compared to that in 1. Thus, no Mg–Mg bond
is present in 6. The low WBIC–O values
suggest the weakening of the C–O bonds in TS5–6 and 6 (see Table S2).

Although 6 is a
stable complex, it dissociates into 9 and CO via the
intermediates 7 and 8 and transition states TS6–7 and TS7–8. Transition
state TS6–7 leads to the
formation of 7 from 6. Transition state TS7–8 has been optimized, which
has 6.1 kcal/mol more free energy than that of 7. Finally, TS7–8 leads to 8, which is an adduct of complex 9 and CO. This 9 is an oxo (μ-O) bridged complex, which has one Mg–O–Mg
moiety. Further, compound 9 grabs another CO2 molecule and forms adduct 10. Then, 10 forms TS10–11, which
finally leads to carbonate complex 11.

Mechanistic
Investigation of N2O Reactivity
N2O
comprises only 6% of the total greenhouse gases and
has 296 times of the global warming potential (GWP) as compared to
that of CO2 (81% of the total greenhouse gases).75 N2O has 121 years of atmospheric
lifetime, which is also much higher than that of CO2, viz.,
30–95 years.76,77 N2O is thermodynamically
stable and is often used as an oxygen transfer agent in organometallic
chemistry.78−80 Here in this study, we have used N2O to
react with 1, which ends up in forming an oxo-bridged
complex 9. The complete reaction energy profile along
with the TSs and intermediates are depicted in Figure 8. First, N2O binds to 1 and forms a prereaction complex 12. The ΔG for the formation of 12 is 0.3 kcal/mol.
A transition state TS12–13 has been found to have 10.2 kcal/mol higher energy as compared to 12. The linear N2O becomes bent in TS12–13. The ∠O–N–N
is 161.7°, and the N–O and N–N bond lengths in TS12–13 are increased by 0.076
and 0.009 Å, respectively, as compared to that in free N2O. The inspection of the HOMO of TS12–13 reveals the interaction between the HOMO
of 1 with the LUMO of N2O (see Figure S5). The total charge of N2O is −0.26 |e|, which suggests that the direction of the flow
of the electron density is 1 to N2O. The TS12–13 then transforms into
intermediate 13, which is stabilized by −35.4
kcal/mol of free energy. The N–O and N–N bond lengths
are 1.370 and 1.219 Å, respectively, and the ∠O–N–N
is 121.0° in 13. The total charge of N2O is −1.64 |e| in 13. The HOMO – 2 of 13 looks like the HOMO of N2O2–, indicating the presence of N2O2– fragment (see Figure S6). At last, 13 gains 14.8
kcal/mol energy and forms TS13–14, which leads to the removal of one N2 molecule
in the reaction. The N–O bond length in TS13–14 is elongated as compared to that
in 13, whereas the N–N bond length is decreased
in TS13–14. The van der
Waals complex 14 has been identified; here, the oxo-bridged 9 and N2 molecule are bound very loosely. The total
stabilization energy of 14 is −122.1 kcal/mol.
At last, 14 removes the N2 molecule, and complex 9 is found.

Figure 8 Relative free energy (in kcal/mol) profile for N2O activation
by 1 calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) level of
theory. The sum of the Gibbs’ free energies of 1 and N2O (−1727.87256059 au) is considered as 0.0
kcal/mol.

Mechanistic Investigation
of CH4 Reactivity
Methane, the smallest member
of the alkane family, has 84 times more
GWP than that of CO2. The complete reaction path for CH4 activation is shown in Figure 9, which looks like the H2 activation reaction
profile. The free energy change for the formation of the prereaction
complex, 15, is 2.4 kcal/mol. A transition state TS15–16 has been formed with
a gain of 41.1 kcal/mol energy as compared to 15. Here,
we would like to mention that recently high energy barriers for C–H
bond activation in CH4 using transition-metal complexes
have been reported.81 The C–H bond
length in free CH4 is 1.089 Å, and the WBIC–H is 0.958. The C–H bond in TS15–16 is elongated to 1.593 Å with a decrease in the WBIC–H value to 0.245 (see Table S2). Thus, the C–H bond is activated here. The HOMO
of the TS15–16 corresponds
to the interaction between the HOMO of 1 and LUMO of
CH4 (see Figure S5). The
charge distribution shows that only the C atom and H atom corresponding
to the elongated C–H bond differs as compared to that in the
free CH4. The H atom acquires negative charge on it, and
the charge on the C atom becomes more negative as compared to the
free CH4. The total charge on CH4 is −0.94
|e|, indicating a charge donation from 1 to CH4. The TS15–16 transforms
to the intermediate 16. Here, the C–H bond under
consideration is dissociated. The H atom formed a bridge between the
two Mg atoms, and the CH3 group is connected to one Mg
atom. Then, 16 reorganizes to its final geometry Mg2EP(μ-CH3)(μ-H), 17, through
the transition state TS16–17. The geometrical and electronic parameters of the intermediate 16 and TS16–17 are almost the same except for the orientation of the bridged H
atom. The outward orientation of μ-H becomes inward in TS16–17. At last, complex 17 has been formed with one μ-H and one μ-CH3 bond. The total gain in free energy is −18.3 kcal/mol,
indicating the spontaneity of the complete process, and it is the
driving force for the reaction.

Figure 9 Relative free energy (in kcal/mol) profile
for CH4 activation
by 1 calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) level of
theory. The sum of the Gibbs’ free energies of 1 and CH4 (−1583.72749242 au) is considered as 0.0
kcal/mol.

Mechanistic Investigation
of Benzene Reactivity
Activation
of an aromatic C–H bond is one of the tough challenges for
organic chemists. We have considered the C–H bond of benzene
to get activated using 1. The complete reaction profile
for the C–H bond activation is shown in Figure 10. Benzene forms a prereaction complex, 18. The ΔG for the formation of 18 is −3.7 kcal/mol. Benzene is bound to 1 with weak van der Walls interaction between them. This complex 18 then undergoes a structural change and forms TS18–19 with a gain of 39.9 kcal/mol
free energy as compared to 18. The HOMO of TS18–19 corresponds to the interaction
between the HOMO of 1 and the LUMO of C6H6. The LUMO of C6H6 receives electron
density from HOMO of 1 (see Figure S5). The charges on the H atom and C atom near the Mg atoms
are −0.27 and −0.66 |e|, respectively, in TS18–19 (see Table S2). There is no considerable change in the charge distribution
of the rest of the benzene molecule (q(rest-C5H5) = −0.04 |e|) as compared to that in
the free C6H6. The total charge of C6H6 is −0.97 |e|, which suggests the flow of electron
density from 1 to C6H6.

Figure 10 Relative
free energy (in kcal/mol) profile for C6H6 activation
by 1 calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p)
level of theory. The sum of the Gibbs’ free energies of 1 and C6H6 (−1775.42920640 au)
is considered as 0.0 kcal/mol.

The TS18–19 is
transformed
to 19, which is 36 kcal/mol lower in free energy as compared
to TS18–19. The geometry
of 19 is almost similar to that of 16. One
H atom forms a bridge between the two Mg atoms, and the C6H5 unit is bound to only one Mg atom. After this point,
the μ-H starts to move inward, which gives TS19–20, with a gain in 2.5 kcal/mol in free
energy as compared to 19. Finally, the μ-H went
to the opposite side of the N4-plane, and the final complex Mg2EP(μ-C6H5)(μ-H), 20, is formed; 20 has one bridging H atom and one bridging
C6H5 group. The total free energy change for
the whole process is −22.1 kcal/mol.

Smallest
Mg–Mg Distance
Another important characteristic
of 4, 17, and 20 is that these
geometries correspond to the smallest Mg···Mg distance
without having any bond between them. We have considered the Mg···Mg
distances in some known bridged [Mg2] complexes, viz.,
Mg2H4 (21), Mg2F4 (22), {(MesNacnac)Mg(μ-H)}2 (23),70 {(DippNacnac)Mg(μ-H)}2 (24),82 (DippNacnac)Mg(μ-H)(μ-I)Mg(MesNacnac) (25),83 (MesNacnac)2Mg2(μ-H)(μ-OSiMe2H) (26),70 and Na2Mg2(NiPr2)4(μ-H)2(toluene) (27)84 (see Figure S7), and compared the Mg···Mg
distances with that of 4, 17, and 20 in Table S3. The comparison
reveals that 17 has the smallest Mg···Mg
distance and that in 4 and 20 are comparable
to 17. The plots of ∇2ρ(r) of 4, 17, and 20 along the Mg···Mg are presented in Figure 11. There is no bond path and
no bond critical point along the Mg···Mg axes in these
complexes. The smallest distance is not achieved by any form of chemical
bond between the two Mg atoms. The force applied by the captive porphyrinoid
ring is a possible reason behind this small Mg···Mg
distance in 4, 17, and 20.

Figure 11 Plot of ∇2ρ(r) for 4, 17, and 20 calculated at the
M06-2X-D3/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. The blue and green lines indicate
∇2ρ(rc) > 0
and
∇2ρ(rc) < 0
regions, respectively.

Summary and Conclusions
The extended 3.1.3.1 [22]porphyrinoid
system, H2EP,
can stabilize the Mg22+ ion. Gas-phase calculations
within the DFT framework have shown that this bimetallic Mg2EP complex is thermochemically and kinetically stable. The complex
possesses one Mg–Mg σ-bond, which is formed mainly by
the 3s and 3p orbitals on the Mg atoms. The AIM analysis revealed
the presence of an NNA near the midpoint of the two Mg atoms. The
electron population at the NNA is high, and the ∇2ρ(r) < 0 at NNA. An ELF basin has been
identified with 61% localization. The computed average linear polarizability
(α̅), first hyperpolarizability (β), and second
hyperpolarizability (γ∥) for Mg2EP are 493.7, 3.62 × 102, and 1.1 × 105 au, respectively. Thus, Mg2EP can be used as a nonlinear
optical material. The properties determined by the AIM and NLO analyses
suggest that the Mg2EP can be considered as an organic
electride material. Furthermore, five small molecules, viz., H2, CO2, N2O, CH4, and C6H6, are shown to get activated using Mg2EP. The H–H bond gets cleaved and finally forms a complex
with two hydrido bridges. The inert aliphatic (CH4) and
aromatic (C6H6) C–H bond activations
can be achieved by the Mg2EP complex. Further, the activated
C–H bond can be broken, and it may form one μ-H and one
μ-CH3 or μ-C6H5 bonded
complex. Thus, Mg2EP has the potential to be used as a
catalyst for C–H bond activation. The global warming gases
like CO2 and N2O are effectively split to CO
and N2, respectively. Thus, Mg2EP is an excellent
choice for the activation of these pollutant gases. The free energy
barriers for the activation of H2, CH4, and
C6H6 by Mg2EP are fairly high to
be used for practical purposes. The current work provides us with
a recipe toward a transition-metal-free catalytic process. Future
modification of the ligand as well as the use of different metals
might lower the activation barrier further and might be used as a
better catalyst.
