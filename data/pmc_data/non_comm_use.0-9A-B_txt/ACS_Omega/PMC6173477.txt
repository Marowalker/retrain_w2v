Coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations are used to model
the self-assembly of small hydrophobic nanoparticles (NPs) within
the interior of lipid bilayers. The simulation results reveal the
conditions under which NPs form clusters and lattices within lipid
bilayers of planar and spherical shapes, depending on the NP–lipid
coupling strengths. The formation of nanopores within spherical bilayers
with self-assembled planar NPs is also described. These
observations can provide guidance in the preparation of functional
bio-inorganic systems.

1 Introduction
Many natural superstructures
are formed by self-assembled lipids,
peptides, proteins, polynucleotides, and other molecules.1 These natural systems have inspired the preparation
of materials composed from self-assembled synthetic nanoscale components,
such as nanoparticles (NPs), block copolymers, and graphene.2−7 Such granular materials can possess highly tunable properties, which
depend on the sizes, shapes, and surface chemistries of the self-assembled
nanoscale components. Complexation of biomolecules with nanoscale
components can produce hybrid materials,8 suitable for molecular sensing, drug delivery, filtration/separation,
and medical imaging.9−15

Recently, hybrid NPs-lipids superstructures have been prepared.
For example, NPs with hydrophobic ligands can form hybrid Janus vesicle-NPs
structures.16−18 Superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs embedded within
lipid vesicles can be used as drug carriers and site-specific contrast
agents in magnetic resonance imaging.19 NPs of different sizes and surface properties can disrupt lipid
bilayers20,21 and change their permeability,22,23 phase transition points,24,25 and mechanical responses.26

The development of hybrid materials requires
a good understanding
of complex interactions of biomolecules and inorganic colloidal NPs.27 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used
to describe NPs self-assembly processes during the formation of materials.28,29 Coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations can describe particularly large
systems, since they map groups of atoms on CG beads. For example,
CGMD simulations have been used to describe translocations of NPs
and fullerene through lipid bilayers.30−35 Small gold NPs coated with a mixture of anionic and hydrophobic
ligands can translocate through lipid membranes without breaking them
down.36−41 These studies have also shown that NPs can adsorb onto or embed
within bilayer membranes depending on their sizes, shapes, and surface
properties. Furthermore, the composition, distribution, and flexibility
of ligands on NP surfaces can influence their translocation behavior.42−44 These studies model the insertion and stabilization of individual
NPs inside lipid bilayers, however, there are relatively few studies
that focus on the synergetic assembly of NPs and lipids in the context
of biohybrid systems, such as the self-assembly of NP chains and nanoshells
guided by lipid membranes.45−47 In particular, the self-assembly
of NP clusters within lipid bilayer has so far not been simulated.

Here, we model hybrid systems formed by superlattices of small
hydrophobic NPs inside lipid bilayers.48−51 These complex systems resemble
other self-standing NPs membranes.52−54 The goal of this study
is to understand the conditions under which NP clusters insert into
lipid bilayers, stabilize within them, and form superstructures. We
also study how NPs of different shapes, sizes, and chemistries affect
the lipid bilayers, in particular, create pores in the bilayers.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 NP Insertion into Lipid
Bilayers
First, we simulate the insertion of a single NP
into a lipid bilayer,
in analogy to graphene insertion into lipid bilayers.8 Small NPs with hydrophobic ligands can enter lipid bilayers
due to a favorable coupling between their ligands and lipid tails,16 as observed in recent experiments.55 The hydrophobic NP is initially solvated in
water within a micelle formed by lipid molecules. The density of lipids
in the micelle determines the NP solubility in water, which affects
its ability to enter the lipid bilayer.

To study the NP insertion
dynamics, we first prepared a 13 × 13 nm2 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer and equilibrated
it in water with no external lateral tension. The equilibrated bilayer
has a thickness of hmem ≈ 5 nm
and a lipid density of dmem ≈ 2
lipids/nm2. A single small (d = 1.6 nm)
hydrophobic NP covered by different numbers of solvation lipid molecules
is placed in water, about 0.1–0.2 nm above the equilibrated
POPC bilayer. These solvation lipid molecules are the same as those
in the bilayer. The coverage of solvation lipids around the NP within
the solution is quantified by a ratio of Rc = Nlip/Nlig, where Nlip is the number of solvation
lipid molecules around the NP and Nlig = 42 is the number of NP ligands. We did not observe detachment
of lipids from the NP during the simulations.

Figure 1a–d
shows the insertion of a hydrophobic NP with a high lipid coverage
(Rc = 2.6). The insertion dynamics closely
resembles a fusion of lipid vesicles.56 At t = 0 ns (beginning of the insertion), the NP-micelle
is in close contact with the surface of the POPC bilayer, maintained
by the coupling between amine and phosphate lipid head groups (Figure 1a). The contact area
directly below the NP becomes flat, which introduces strain onto the
lipid molecules around it. The strained regions of the bilayer eventually
rupture and expose the NP ligands to the hydrophobic interior of the
lipid bilayer (Figure 1b). Figure 1f shows
the ruptured region of the micelle at the bottom of the NP above the
lipid bilayer. The NP initially interacts only with the top lipid
layer, and the bottom lipid layer responds to the movement of the
top lipid layer. However, as the ruptured region of the bilayer slowly
expands, the NP ligands penetrate the top lipid layer and start to
interact with lipid tails in the bottom leaflet of the lipid bilayer
(Figure 1c), which
creates a distinct inverted funnel-shape structure below the NP. At t = 84 ns, the NP is inside the bilayer, and the funnel
structure starts to recede (Figure 1d). The stabilization of the inserted NP within these
asymmetrical lipid layers can take another ≈100 ns. The flip-flop
motion of lipids between the top and bottom leaflets of the bilayer
is expected to restore the symmetry of the bilayer over microsecond
to millisecond timescale.

Figure 1 (a–d) Snapshots and close-up views of
the first 84 ns of
a NP inclusion process. Arrows indicate the motion of NP and lipid
molecules. Initially, the NP is covered with 112 solvation lipids
(Rc = 2.6), which are colored in green
to distinguish them from those of the bilayer. Nearby water molecules
are shown in red. (e) The inclusion time of NP with different coverages

This NP is solvated by 126 lipid molecules (Rc = 3.0), and it does not penetrate the bilayer within our
simulation time. (h, i) Tilt angle analysis of the solvation lipid
when Rc = 1.33. Normalized distributions
of an azimuthal tilt angle and an angle between hydrophobic tails
of POPC lipid molecules.

The initial coverage of lipids around the NP determines the
time
it takes the NP to intercalate within the lipid bilayer. We can define
an insertion time, tin, as the time from
the NP penetration of the top leaflet till its full stabilization
within the bilayer. Figure 1e shows the dependence of tin on
the lipid coverage ratio, Rc. When the
lipid coverage is relatively low (Rc ≤
1), the insertion time is constant, tin ≈ 6.5 ns, where the NP insertion involves an abrupt penetration
of the top bilayer leaflet. Rapid penetration of NP through the lipid
layer is driven by a minimization of water surface tension (hydrophobic
interactions). When Rc > 1, the insertion
mechanism follows the previously described fusion of lipids. The growth
of tin with Rc is due to an increased density of lipids on the NP surface, which
gives a more stable micelle within the water solvent. Figure 1h,i shows a significant change
in the angle distribution of these lipid molecules before the insertion
(red) and after (green) as compared to a normal bilayer (blue). In
the simulations, we observe coupling between polar head groups of
the bilayer and a NP-micelle even for a full lipid coverage (Rc > 3), as shown in Figure 1g. However, these closely packed lipids prevent
the formation of a strained flat surface that is needed to initiate
membrane rupturing of the NP insertion process.

2.2 Equilibrium NP–Lipid Superstructures
Next, we
investigate how small hydrophobic NPs (d = 1.6 nm)
self-assemble once they enter the lipid bilayer. In general,
their equilibrium arrangement depends on the NP–NP, NP–lipid,
and lipid–lipid coupling strengths, NP shapes, and other parameters.
We first model NPs with variable NP–NP coupling strengths,
while keeping the other coupling strengths fixed. The relative coupling
strengths between NPs are scaled by a factor of α = ϵ1/ϵ0, where ϵ1 is the modified
strength of the C1S–C1S (NP–NP)
Lennard-Jones (LJ) coupling and ϵ0 is the original
strength of C1S–C1S LJ coupling, equivalent
to the C1S–C1 (NP–lipid) and C1–C1 (lipid–lipid) LJ coupling strengths.
Different NP–lipid structures are observed, depending on the
NP–NP coupling strength (α = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and the
number of lipids present in the system.

For a small number of
lipids (≈452), a 13 NP cluster forms a compact cluster when
α > 1 or it reorganizes into a small liposome from a micelle-coated
NP cluster (Figure 2a) when α = 0.5. The equilibrated liposome structure is similar
to Janus-NP vesicles.16 Such structure
is more stable for weakly coupled NPs, since it maximizes the amount
of coupling between NP ligands and lipid tails. In our simulations,
we observed about a dozen of water molecules entering the hydrophilic
interior of the liposome during the liposome reorganization process.
These results show that how nanosize vesicles could be prepared by
designing NPs with hydrophobic ligands having NP–NP interactions
weaker than NP–lipid interactions (possibly by adjusting the
length of alkyl NP ligands) and allowing a cluster of such NPs to
self-assemble with lipids. These vesicles can potentially be designed
for use as transport cargo in biological systems. Such vesicles are
difficult to prepare in experiments due to the strain induced by the
formation of a large surface curvature.

Figure 2 (a) Reorganization of
lipid molecules in a liposome carrying 13
NPs with α = 0.5. (b–d) Stabilization of 13 NPs within
a lipid bilayer: (b) α = 0.5 after 125 ns, (c) α = 1.0
after 814 ns, (d) α = 1.5 after 359 ns. (e) The height of small
NP clusters, hC(α). (f) Hexagonal
arrangement of 48 hydrophobic NPs with α = 1 equilibrated in
the lipid bilayer for 500 ns.

When the lipids form a bilayer, a 13 NP cluster within it
can form
a loose monolayer (Figure 2b) when α = 0.5, a close-packed monolayer (Figure 2c) when α =
1, or a compact globular cluster (Figure 2d) when α = 1.5. To better understand
this self-assembly behavior, NP clusters formed of 4 (tetrahedron),
5 (trigonal bipyramid), and 6 (octahedron) NPs with α = 0.5–2.4
are simulated inside a lipid bilayer. We calculated the average height
of the equilibrated NP cluster, hC, by
subtracting the z-coordinate of the bottom-most SC4 CG beads from top-most SC4 CG beads. Figure 2e shows a plot of hC as a function of α, averaged over the
last 75 ns of the t ≈ 250 ns long simulations.
NPs in larger clusters (5, 6 NPs) have more contact points with each
other, which leads to stronger clusters that flatten only at smaller
α. Similar to the 13 NP clusters shown in Figure 2b–d, all of these clusters flatten
at α ≤ 1 to a loose or compact monolayer with a hexagonal
close-packed arrangement. Figure 2f shows a fully equilibrated monolayer of initially
scattered 48 NPs with α = 1.

The results in Figure 2 can be better understood if
we realize that bilayer membranes
are stabilized through a balance of positive and negative lateral
tensions, generated by the different molecular groups present at different
heights.57,58 At equilibrium, the net lateral tension
is close to zero. However, this balance is changed when the bilayer
is deformed by the inserted NPs, leading to local tensions caused
by the exposure of hydrophobic groups in curved lipid membranes.59 This local tension generates a net vertical
force on the inserted NP cluster (flattening), which determines its
equilibrium height, hC. Therefore, NP
clusters can be formed from coalescence of individually inserted NPs
or from the direct insertion of a NP cluster into the lipid bilayer.
The lateral and vertical sizes, as well as the overall shapes, of
the equilibrated NP clusters within the superstructure correlate to
the border surface tension of the lipid layers.

2.3 Stabilization of Nanodiscs (NDs) in Liposomes
Hybrid
superstructures might be also formed within curved bilayers,
such us liposomes. To examine this possibility, we prepared equilateral
triangular nanodiscs (NDs) with a side length of lND ≈ 7.2 nm and a thickness of h ≈ 0.6 nm; Gd2O3 nanoplates60 and triangular gold nanodiscs61 have been prepared experimentally.62−65 These triangular NDs were arranged
into groups of 6 and 5 to form larger hexagonal and pentagonal plates.
Using 180 NDs arranged into 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons on a sphere
and coated with (36 748) lipid molecules in water, we prepared
a large truncated icosahedron shape liposome structure (Figure 3a), resembling a fullerene.
Self-assembled hexagons have a zero curvature (planar), whereas self-assembled
pentagons provide a positive curvature, necessary for the formation
of a spherical polyhedra. Note that other convex polyhedrons satisfying
the Euler characteristic of the sphere, i.e., NV – NE + NF = 2 (number of vertices, edges, and faces), can in principle
be prepared using triangular NDs.

and planar POPC bilayers. (a) Hybrid NP–liposome (d ≈ 30 nm) with 180 intercalated triangular NDs and 36 748
lipid molecules solvated in 2 669 168 water beads after
150 ns equilibration. A portion of the lipids at the top is hidden
to show better the NDs organization. Representative 5 (pentagon) and
6 (hexagon) ND clusters are marked. (b) A cluster of such 6 triangular
NDs inside a POPC bilayer, equilibrated for 200 ns. A color map surface
is fitted to the polar heads of the lipid molecules to show the bilayer
structure. (c, d) Normalized distributions of an azimuthal tilt angle
and an angle between hydrophobic tails of POPC lipid molecules in
the pore, ND ring, and bilayer regions, shown in (b). (e) Side view
of a central portion of the pore, showing water molecules in red and
polar head group of lipids in blue. (f) Fluctuations of water beads
within the pore region.

Liposomes intercalated with NDs, such as shown in Figure 3a, can have unique
features
and applications. Partial equilibration of this hybrid NP–liposome
(α = 1) for 150 ns shows a significant annihilation of defects,
present in the initial configuration, which leads to an overall stabilization
of the whole superstructure. The intercalated NDs do not disturb much
the lipid vesicle stability, since its fluidic lipid double layer
naturally seals off small gaps and holes initially present between
the NDs. However, it turns out that healing of holes is not complete
for the current thickness and shape of nanoplates. One can observe
a transient formation and disappearance of water chains in nanopores
between the NDs tips, which are only partially filled with lipids
and the associated opening and closure of the nanopore. These pores
might allow the exchange of molecules between the interior and exterior
of the NP–liposome, as in NPs capsules.28

Figure 3b shows
a standalone nanopore formed between 6 NDs intercalated within a flat
POPC bilayer (≈29.2 × 29.2 nm2) and simulated
for ≈200 ns. Although this single-pore system is flat, the
pore should have similar characteristics, like nanopores present in
the above hybrid spherical liposome. The colored surface in Figure 3b clearly shows that
the pore of ≈2 nm in diameter is formed along a vertical axis
within a ring structure of 6 NDs. A cross-section snapshot of the
pore region, displayed in Figure 3e, reveals a large tilting of lipids taking part during
their wrapping around the NDs. In the confined geometry of 6 nearby
NDs, lipids form a cylindrical structure, with their polar heads arranged
in the center along the vertical axis of the cylindrical pore, attracting
thus water molecules.

To quantify an average configuration of
lipids present within the
pore, we first analyze their orientation in the bilayer, ring, and
pore regions specified in Figure 3b. Two angles, θ and ϕ, are defined to
measure the overall tilt angle of a lipid molecule from the vertical z-axis and the spread angle between its two hydrophobic
tails, respectively (see inset of Figure 3d). The angular distributions present in Figure 3c,d show that lipids
in the ring structure, directly above and below the NDs, have an orientation
that is similar to a normal lipid bilayer with θ = 40°
and ϕ = 60°. However, lipids in the pore region have a
very different orientation. These lipids are significantly tilted
with a wide range of tilt angles (θ = 60–120°) and
the hydrophobic tails within each lipid are relatively well separated
(ϕ = 70°).

Our simulations reveal the formation of
1–2 water chains
within the pore region. Once formed, the nanopores are stable within
the simulation time scale, however, the passage of water through the
nanopore is fluctuating. These water chains are typically one-molecule
wide but can also be two-molecule wide. To quantify the pore dynamics
and its potential for a molecular transport, we monitor the presence
of water inside the interstitial region between 6 NDs. Figure 3f shows a time-dependent water
filling of the pore by revealing the z-positions
of all water CG beads with respective to the middle plane of the bilayer.
We can identify the formation of transient water chains occasionally
passing for a few picoseconds through the whole pore region. Therefore,
we can see that the aligned polar heads in the center of the pore
could facilitate the transport of water and other solvated molecules.
Similar exchange of molecules can be anticipated between the interior
and exterior of a hybrid NP–liposome, shown in Figure 3a.

3 Computational
Methods
We study the NP–lipid systems using CGMD simulations
with
the MARTINI force field,66 where roughly
every four nonhydrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms coupled to them are
mapped onto a CG bead (see Table 1). The bonded and nonbonded interactions between CG
beads are parameterized based on the MARTINI 2.0 force field,67 where the bonded interactions between beads
are described using harmonic potentials and the nonbonded interactions
between beads are described using Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials 1  where σ is the effective minimum distance
between two beads (zero-crossing point of the potential) and ϵ
is the strength of their interaction.

The gold NP core (d = 1.6 nm) is formed by 55
SC4-type CG beads arranged into a cuboctahedral shape of
a face-centered cubic lattice structure. The bonding distance between
these beads is 4.08 Å, which is the lattice constant of bulk
gold. This structure is maintained by relatively rigid bonds (15 kcal/(mol
Å2)) and SC4–SC4–SC4 angles (60°, 2.988 kcal/(mol rad2)). In a
similar way, triangular nanodiscs (ND) are modeled using SC4-type CG beads arranged into a hexagonal close-packed lattice structure.
Dodecanethiol ligands are attached onto all CG beads that are on the
NP surface. Each ligand is represented as a linear chain of three
apolar C1S-type CG beads, with parameters of saturated
carbon chains (C1-type) from the MARTINI force field, since
they are chemically similar to the hydrophobic tails of lipid molecules.
In this model, the interactions between NP ligands are assumed to
be dominant, such that the interactions between NP cores are neglected.
This is a valid assumption for NPs with a normal-to-high ligand density.63,68 Therefore, the coupling strength between neighboring NPs is controlled
by the strength of nonbonded interaction between C1S CG
beads.

The lipid bilayer is prepared from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) molecules. The amine
head groups, phosphate head groups, and hydrophobic tails of the POPC
molecules are modeled using Q0-type, Qa-type, and C1-type CG beads, respectively. These
POPC molecules are also used to form a micelle enclosure for the solvation
of hydrophobic NPs in water. The lipid bilayer is solvated in water
(P4-type CG beads), with one antifreezing molecule (BP4-type CG bead) added to every 9 water beads to prevent the
undesirable crystallization of water at 310 K, formed due to the simplified
description of water molecules in the MARTINI force field.67 BP4-type beads are modified P4-type beads with σ = 5.7 Å for the BP4–P4 LJ coupling.

The CGMD simulations are
performed with the nanoscale molecular
dynamics software69−71 in an isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble. A barostat
pressure of P = 1 atm is maintained by the Langevin
piston method,72 with a decay period of
200 fs and a damping coefficient of 50 fs. A Langevin thermostat is
set to T = 310 K, with a damping coefficient of 1
ps–1 and a timestep of t = 20 fs.

4 Conclusions
We have investigated the insertion, stabilization,
structure, and
dynamics of small hydrophobic NPs and their clusters inside lipid
bilayers of planar and spherical shapes. The insertion dynamics is
controlled by lipid coverage around the NP. Less protected NPs are
less soluble in water and therefore have a faster insertion into the
lipid bilayers. The equilibrium structures of NP clusters formed inside
lipid bilayers are correlated with the relative coupling strength
between the NP ligands and lipids. Hybrid structures of NDs intercalated
within liposomes are also simulated. We observed the formation of
nanopores between 6 NDs intercalated within lipid bilayers, allowing
a transient passage of water. These simulation results provide insights
into the complex but intriguing co-assembly behavior of NPs with lipid
bilayers. We envision this study to inspire future studies that can
potentially look into the insertion mechanisms of shaped NPs, such
as triangular NDs, and the effect of size polydispersity in pore formation.
