Herein,
we present the C-14 levulinate ester of 2,3-butanediol
as the product of sugar fermentation liquors. The designed Brønsted
acidic ionic liquid (BAIL) catalysts enable self-induced phase separation
with ester products, and the role of anions has been investigated.
Esterification reactions were carried out by 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO)
and levulinic acid in solvent-free media and low temperatures (60–105
°C). For comparison, sulfuric acid, amberlite IR-120, and sulfonic
acid-functionalized pyridinium ionic liquids with different anions
were utilized as a catalyst upon esterification reaction. The diester
product, namely, butane-2,3-diyl bis(4-oxopentanoate), was formed
with a good yield (85%) and selectivity (85%) after complete conversion
of 2,3-BDO in 24 h at 80 °C. The low yield (8%) of the monoester
was observed. The monoester and diester were separated by a liquid–liquid
extraction method. The ester products were characterized by various
instrumental techniques such as 1H and 13C NMR,
GC–FID, LC–MS, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The Hammett acidity
functions of BAILs were determined from UV–vis spectroscopy.
The catalyst was successfully recycled and reused in the processes.
The spent BAILs were reused in six consecutive cycles with only a
∼7% diminished diester yield and selectivity. The produced
levulinate ester will be useful as biofuel additives, solvents, plasticizers,
and other applications.

1 Introduction
The
levulinate ester and oxygenated biofuels derived from biomass
are inspiring as potentially sustainable and green products obtained
via green processes. Levulinate ester and oxygenated biofuels are
demonstrated as potential fuel additives and compounds that are able
to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.1−3 One of them,
levulinic acid (LA) based ester, is a potential green chemical produced
from cellulose at an industrial scale, namely, in the “biofine
process” catalyzed by sulfuric acid.4 On the other hand, 2,3-BDO is obtained from the fermentation liquors
of sugars (glucose and xylose).5 The 2,3-BDO
biomolecule is mainly produced by hydrolysis of 2,3-epoxybutane at
an industrial scale. This, in turn, is used as a precursor in the
manufacture of a range of chemical products, including solvents such
as methyl ethyl ketone, gamma-butyrolactone, and their ester to produce
1,3-butadiene.6−8 The esterification reaction of LA with methanol to
higher chain alcohols has been demonstrated over various homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalysts and the ester can have use in a range
of applications such as biofuel additives, fragrances, cosmetic products,
plasticizers, solvents, and a range of material formations.3,9−14 Texaco tested blending of 20% ethyl levulinate, 79% diesel, and
1% of other coadditives in diesel engines and the results indicated
reduced sulfur and NOx emissions.15,16 Moreover, good improvements in the physical properties such as cold
point (CP), pour point, and cold filter plugging points as well as
low kinematic viscosity were found.17 The
blending of levulinate ester or fatty acid ester in diesel also reduced
the NOx and SOx emissions.18,19 The shortest alkyl chain, methyl
levulinate is a potential gasoline additive. The higher alkylated
levulinates have a better solubility in aromatics-rich diesel range
fuels and biodiesel.20,21 The boiling point of ethyl levulinate
and longer chain levulinate have similar boiling points to the heavy
gasoline compounds (475 K) or middle diesel fuel boiling range.22 They neither significantly alter the volatility
nor require any modification to the existing diesel engine upon their
blending with diesel.21

Upon esterification,
processes have been promoted by strong acids
like H2SO4, HCl, para-toluenesulfonic
acid, Brønsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs), and heterogeneous
catalysts.23−25,27 However, overcoming
the disadvantages of mineral acids such as product separation, high
corrosion rate, reusability, and difficulties in handing require an
alternative catalyst. Alternatively, BAILs are potential candidates
and were investigated in chemical synthesis as greener catalysts and
environmentally benign alternatives.24 BAILs
with [HSO4] anions and functionalized sulfonic acid ionic
liquids (ILs) has been found to be less corrosive compared to sulfuric
acid.25,26 Heterogeneous catalysis is always preferred
in terms of easy product separation, catalyst reusability, temperature
sustainability, and selective product formation. However, in order
to operate, heterogeneous catalysts typically require high temperature
owing to their lower reactivity. Catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition
is a major obstacle compared to the homogeneous catalysts. Multifunctional
molecules are not suitable when operating at high-temperatures because
of the formation of many byproducts. Also, byproduct separation is
another tedious task to obtain the desired, pure product. Therefore,
systems that operate at low temperatures and biphasic systems are
the most promising way to perform chemical transformations, particularly
in the presence of water (or in situ formation of water). In this
regard, IL catalysts are potentially most effective, thermally stable,
low volatile, nonflammable, reusable, and highly reactive similar
to the homogeneous catalysts.24,27 The advantages of biphasic
IL catalysts are easy product separation, lower temperature reaction,
easy catalyst recycle, and efficiency in repeated cycles. Recently,
Riisager et al. reported the synthesis of ethyl levulinate from mono
and disaccharides using sulfonic acid-functionalized ILs as catalysts.27 Han et al. reported halogen-free Brønsted–Lewis
acidic IL catalysts for esterification upon synthesis of methyl caprylate.28 The biphasic system induced separation of ester
products with the help of heteropolyanion-based ILs.23 However, HPAs are costly materials. Recently, alkyl imidazolium
hydrogen sulfate was demonstrated as a self-induced biphasic system
upon butyl levulinate production with 98.1% yield and selectivity.29 Also, the suitably designed BAILs were used
as a biphasic reaction media for the long-chain ester (wax ester,
yield 99%) synthesis in a solvent-free media.30 However, few ester products of 2,3-BDO have been reported with monobasic
acids or their functional equivalents.6,31 The esterification
of 2,3-BDO with formic acid and acetic acid catalyzed by H2SO4 and the diester yields were found to be 70 and 85%,
respectively.6 Jacquin et al. studied the
kinetics of esterification of 2,3-BDO with acetic acid over a heterogeneous
catalyst (Amberlyst 36).32 Further, upon
esterification of LA with glycerol, the diacylglycerides became the
major products at a reaction temperature of 140 °C with 85% selectivity
over Al-SBA-15 as the heterogeneous catalyst.33 The esterification of glycerol with LA gives new opportunities in
terms of highly oxygenated biofuel additives.34 Similarly, triacetin improved the physical properties of the fuel
like CP and viscosity after blending in biodiesel.35 Therefore, biomass-based renewable alcohols and carboxylic
acids are promising oxygenated biofuel additives among other applications.

Herein, we for the first time report the new types of biomolecules,
namely, butane-2,3-diyl bis(4-oxopentanoate) as a diester and 3-hydroxybutan-2-yl
4-oxopentanoate as a monoester. The esterification reaction between
2,3-BDO and LA catalyzed by Brønsted ILs gives rise to self-induced
phase separation. The reaction was performed in a solvent free media
at low temperatures (80 °C) whereupon good yield (85%) and selectivity
(85%) was obtained. In comparison, similar yields and selectivities
of diester were observed as per previous reports over both homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalysts. Recycled ILs were reused multiple times
in the processes with slightly deteriorating chemical activity. The
diester and monoester were separated with the liquid–liquid
extraction method.

2 Result and Discussion
The prepared C-14 levulinate ester could be useful as biofuel additives
and in other applications. Several other levulinate esters and oxygenated
biofuel additives have been proposed as suitable fuels for diesel
engines. Some oxygenated biofuel additives are summarized in Table 1. We are introducing
C-14 levulinate ester of 2,3-butanediol with LA, namely, butane-2,3-diyl
bis(4-oxopentanoate). We expect that the physico-chemical properties
and other parameters of the prepared levulinate ester are suitable
for blending in diesel fuels. Advances in the development of biofuel
additives from renewable resources promote the transfer from fossil
to alternative sources of transportation fuels.

2.1 Characterization
of Products
The
purified products, diester and monoester were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy. The NMR spectra of butane-2,3-diyl bis(4-oxopentanoate)
as a diester of 2,3-BDO with LA are given in Figure 1. The proton peak of −COO–CH–
appears at 4.94 ppm of the diester. The proton shifted to −CH3 (∼0.1) form the original position and proton peaks
of −OH and −CH– of 2,3-BDO vanished after complete
esterification. 13C NMR revealed that the new peak that
appeared at 172.16 ppm was found to correspond to ester carbon peaks
(−COO−) and the disappeared carboxylic functional group
peak of LA from 178.41 ppm (Figure S2b,d). Hereupon, the diester product was confirmed. Meanwhile, partial
esterification of 2,3-BDO forms the monoester, the proton peak of
−COO–CH– appears at 4.88 ppm, and a small shift
(∼0.2 ppm) of the −CH–O– proton. The 1H NMR of monoester, 2,3-BDO and LA are given in Figure S1. Two different methyl protons (two
doublet) were also observed because of different chemical environments
(Figure S1c). Similarly, 13C
NMR of the monoester −COO– peak observed at 172.64 ppm
and four different peaks were observed after monoester formation (Figure S2c). FT-IR spectra revealed the ester
formation of LA with 2,3-BDO, which are shown in Figure S3. The broad peak of O–H stretching of 2,3-butanediol
and the monoester was detected at 3338 and 3446 cm–1, respectively. The strong carbonyl stretching of ketone, carboxylate,
and acidic functional groups was observed in the range of 1700–1738
cm–1. After the higher magnification of carbonyl
peak, all three peaks were differentiated from each other (Figure 2). In the IR spectra
of LA, the peak at 1701 and 1737 cm–1 corresponds
to C=O stretching of ketone and carboxylic acid functional
groups, respectively. The C=O stretching of carboxylate detected
at 1730 and 1732 cm–1 of the diester and monoester
(Figure 2). This advocated
the esterification reaction. However, in the ester products, C=O
stretching of ketone functional groups shifted from 1701 to 1716.5
and 1714.6 cm–1 in the diester and monoester. The
O–H stretching completely vanished after diester formation.
The C–O stretching of 2,3-BDO and LA were detected at 1055
and 1159 cm–1. However, in the case of the diester,
C–O was detected at 1155 cm–1 (Figure S3). The calibration curves were obtained
using different concentrations of purified products (Figure S4). The molecular ion (m/z) of both the monoester and diester was confirmed by liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) spectra. The
M + 1 peak of the monoester and diester was obtained at 189.2 and
287.2 (Figure S5).

2.2 Esterification of 2,3-Butanediol and LA by
H2SO4/BAILs
Preliminary experiments
were carried out at 105 °C by H2SO4/BAILs
(0.57 mmol) with 2 gm of LA and 0.78 gm of 2,3-BDO (2,3-BDO:LA, 1:2
mole ratio) in a closed system. The product yields are summarized
in Table S2. The BAILs-1, BAILs-2, and
H2SO4 displayed similar catalytic behavior observed
upon diester formation because of comparable Hammett acidity functions
(Ho) (Table S2, Entry 1–4). Complete conversion of 2,3-BDO was observed.
The ester products were formed with yields of around 50–60%
only because of the formation of intermediates and byproducts. Also,
the diester yields did not exceed 40–42% after increasing the
reaction time from 4 to 6 h, at 105 °C. BAILs-3 gave rise to
a poor yield of the diester (10%) and monoester (23%) at 105 °C
after 6 h (Table S2, Entry 5). In the case
of BAILs-4 (HSO4 anion, Ho =
∼2.98), very low esterification levels were found (Table S2, Entry 6). The plausible reasons are
that the Hammett acidity was low and a steric hindrance by a methyl
group was present (double activation energy required).32 Similar results were also reported in case of
esterification when higher Ho value (low
Brønsted acidity) compounds were utilized and lower yields of
ester products formed in BAILs.36 For comparison
with a heterogeneous catalyst, Amberlite IR-120 (20 wt % dry) was
used. As a result, the diester yield was 35% (Table S2, Entry 7). The reason behind the low yield of ester
products is that the equilibrium shifts. In fact, water hampers the
forward reaction to the products (in situ generation). Therefore,
we tried to continuously evaporate water during esterification reaction
as well as increase the catalyst loading. After esterification, BAIL-2
gave rise to two-phase separation and detailed studies with other
BAILs were commenced. Herein, we selected BAIL-2 as the catalyst of
choice for more detailed studies like catalyst loading, the influence
of temperature, and the role of LA concentration to enhance the product
yield and selectivity.

2.3 Catalyst Loading of BAIL-2
The catalyst
loading of BAIL-2 was increased from 0.57 to 1.71 mmol (3 times) and
water was subjected to continuous evaporation at 105 °C for 6
h. Even then, the maximum yield of diester 61% was reached after 6
h at 105 °C with the same catalyst concentration (0.57 mmol).
In case of doubling the catalyst loading (1.14 mmol), the diester
yield was increased from 61 to 65% after complete conversion of 2,3-BDO
(Figure 3A). Further
increase in catalyst loading (1.71 mmol) resulted in poorer yield
and selectivity of the diester. To perceive the catalyst activity
of other BAILs, more experiments were executed at this concentration
(1.14 mmol) under identical conditions.

2.4 Catalyst
Optimization for Esterification Reaction
of 2,3-BDO with LA
The synthesized BAILs, H2SO4 (1.14 mmol), and Amberlite IR-120 (20 wt % dry) were investigated
at 105 °C in a reaction lasting for several hours. The maximum
yield of esters are summarized in Figure 3B. In the presence of H2SO4, fast kinetics was observed and the diester yield reached
61% after 2 h. BAIL-1 and BAIL-2 also performed well with fast kinetics.
The maximum diester yields for BAIL-1 (58.4%) and BAIL-2 (65%) were
observed at 4 h. Surprisingly, BAIL-3 gave rise to the poorest yield
and BAIL-4 was even less effective as discussed earlier, even after
24 h. Moreover, the performance of BAIL-3 and BAIL-4 was not much
improved upon higher catalyst loading (2.28 mmol) and the diester
yields of around 16.6 and 23.4%, respectively, were observed after
24 h. In case of Amberlite IR-120 (20% dry wt), a low diester yield
(59%) was observed after 24 h. Further, we tried to play with the
LA concentration while maintaining the same temperature and chose
BAIL-2 as the catalyst.

2.5 Influence of LA Concentration
(Dilution Effect)
At stoichiometric mole ratios bad diester
selectivities were observed.
Therefore, we experimented with shifting the equilibrium toward the
product with 1.14 mmol catalyst loading at 105 °C. As a result,
the diester yield and selectivity were enhanced from 65 to 77% when
3 moles of LA (excess) was used. The values represent concentrations
at complete conversion of 2,3-BDO. The diester and monoester yields
are summarized in Figure 4A. Similarly, the yield and selectivity of diester are reported
for the case when four times excess LA was present at otherwise identical
conditions. There are many possibilities of byproduct formation in
the presence of strong acid and at high temperature, as previously
reported.37,38 This could be the reason for low diester
yields and selectivities. Therefore, achieving the highest yield and
selectivity of the diester, low temperature esterification is necessary.
The highest yields (diester 85% and monoester 8%) were observed at
low temperature (80 °C), at the complete conversion of 2,3-BDO
(24 h at 80 °C, Figure 4B). The temperature plays a significant role upon esterification
and faster esterification was observed at the higher temperature as
depicted in Figure 4B. On decreasing the temperature from 105 to 60 °C, slower rate
of esterification was naturally observed. A low diester yield (60%)
was observed at 60 °C after 24 h.

of products in the molar ratio of 2,3-BDA:LA (1:3) from 60 to 105
°C with 1.14 mmol catalyst for various reaction times.

2.6 Conversion of 2,3-BDO and
Catalyst Reusability
Initially, 2,3-BDO converted into an
intermediate monoester and
some diester as well as small amounts of byproducts were observed.
Similar phenomena were observed at all three temperatures. Along with
the time, the intermediates (Retention Time 14.6 and 14.7) and the
monoester (Retention Time 14.9) slowly converted into the diester
(Retention Time 18.5). The conversion of 2,3-BDO and the formation
of its esters upon the mole ratio 2,3-BDA:LA (1:3), at 80 °C,
are depicted in Figure 5A. The conversion of 2,3-BDO reached 97% after 2 h. However, the
yields of the monoester and diester were 24 and 25%, respectively,
at 80 °C. The highest yield of the diester was achieved after
24 h (85%) and complete conversion of 2,3-BDO was observed. The catalyst
BAIL-2 was successfully recycled in the lower phase but a trace amount
of BAIL-2 was also observed in the upper phase by 1H NMR
spectra. Therefore, we used diethyl ether for complete recovery of
the catalyst and reused it in the process multiple times (Figure 5B) without adding
the fresh catalyst. Interestingly, the yield of the diester slightly
improved in the second and third cycle (89.4 and 88%, respectively)
after 24 h. However, a constant diester yield (78.35%) was observed
from the fourth to sixth cycle (Figure 5B), at complete conversion of 2,3-BDO.

upon six consecutive catalytic cycles (BAIL-2 1.14 mmol) at a molar
ratio of 2,3-BDA:LA (1:3) at 80 °C.

2.7 Self-Induced Biphasic Separation of the Catalyst
after Esterification
Among all the synthesized BAILs, only
BAIL-2 was automatically phase separated after esterification in 2,3-BDO:LA
(1:2) at 105 °C (Figure 6A). Even when higher molar excess of LA and lower temperature
(80 °C) were applied, automatic phase separation occurred (Figure 6A). The lower phase
contained BAIL-2 and the upper phase the ester products, byproducts,
and unreacted LA.

Figure 6 (A) Pictorial demonstration of phase separation of BAILs,
(B) immiscibility
of the catalyst with the diester product.

The upper phase moisture contained was 2.5 wt %. It is noteworthy
that BAIL-1 is miscible with the purified diester because of its anion
moiety. On the contrary, BAIL-1, BAIL-3, and BAIL-4 were immiscible
with the purified diester (Figure 6B). BAIL-3 and BAIL-4 were not good catalysts for diester
formation as discussed above and the reason might be related to the
fact that no phase separation occurred. Despite higher catalyst loading
(2.28 mmol), neither BAIL-3 nor BAIL-4 were phase separated.

3 Conclusions
As a summary, we demonstrated automatic
phase separation of BAILs
in esterification reaction of sugar liquors at low temperatures. The
levulinate ester product could be useful upon blending with diesel
as an oxygenated biofuel additive (similarly the di and tri-ester
of glycerol with LA). One of the advantages is the reduced SOx and NOx formation.
Complete conversion of 2,3-BDO and good yield (85%) of the diester
were obtained at 80 °C in 24 h. The sulfonic acid-functionalized
pyridinium IL catalysts were successfully recycled and reused in the
process. The high catalytic activity is likely thanks to their Brønsted
acidity. Moreover, the water scavenging property of BAILs favor the
equilibrium shift toward the products at low temperatures. Diesters
of 2,3-BDO and LA could find use as plasticizers, solvents, and in
other similar applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
LA (98%), 2,3-butanediol
(98%, CAS Number 513-85-9), pyridine (98%), 1,4-butane sultone, (98%),
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, (97%), HCl (37%), H2SO4 (97%), and Amberlyte IR-120 (H-form) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich.
Ethyl acetate (99.5%) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. All solvents
(hexane, toluene, and diethyl ether) used were of ACS grade and used
as received.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Characterization
The synthesized
BAILs and ester products were characterized by utilizing 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy with Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz
NMR instruments. All the NMR spectra were assigned using Bruker’s
Topspin (4.0.6) processing software. The Hammett acidity functions
of BAILs were determined using UV/vis spectroscopy (Cary 5000 UV–Vis–NIR
spectrophotometer). The attenuated total reflectance—FT-IR
spectroscopy (ATR–FT-IR) technique was used for the analysis
of functional groups before and after esterification of LA by a Bruker
Vertex 80v FT-IR spectrometer (vacuum bench) with a DTGS detector.
The thermal stability of BAILs were analyzed by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) by heating the samples under an Ar flow using a Netzsch
STA 449 F3 Jupiter” (STA) instrument. All samples were heated
from 25 to 500 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The moisture contained in the BAILs was analyzed by Karl Fischer
titration using a KF-coulometer (Metrohm). A gas chromatography–flame
ionization detector (GC–FID) (Agilent 6890 N) equipped with
an HP-5 column was used for quantitative analysis of products.

4.2.2 Synthesis of BAILs
The BAILs (Figure 7) were synthesized
according to the literature report with slight modifications.39 For the synthesis of BAILs, an equimolar amount
of pyridine (5 g, 63 mmol) and 1,4-butanesultone (8.6 g, 63 mmol)
were stirred at 40 °C for 6 h, after which 10 mL toluene was
added. The reaction mixture was continuously stirred at 100 °C
for 12 h. The toluene was evaporated and the zwitterionic precursor
was washed three times using diethyl ether. The zwitterionic precursor
was further mixed with a stoichiometric amount of CF3SO3H for preparation of 1-(4-sulfonic) butyl pyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate
(BAIL-1), H2SO4 for 1-(4-sulfonic) butyl pyridinium
hydrogen sulfate (BAIL-2), and HCl for 1-(4-sulfonic) butyl pyridinium
chloride (BAIL-3) in water and stirred overnight at room temperature.
The resulting BAILs were washed with diethyl ether and dried under
vacuum over a Schleck line. The obtained BAIL-1 and BAIL-2 were liquid,
while BAIL-3 was a solid powder. The overall yield of BAILs were founded
in the range of 75–80%. The equimolar pyridine (three times
diluted by H2O) and H2SO4 (three
times diluted by H2O, exothermic reaction, be careful!)
were slowly mixed under stirring at 5 °C. The reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. After this step, water was
evaporated and the obtained pyridinium hydrogen sulfate was washed
with diethyl ether. The yield of pyridinium hydrogen sulfate was 96%
(BAIL-4). The moisture content of all as synthesized BAILs were found
in the range of 2–3 wt % based on a Karl Fisher titration.
The 1H NMR of precursor molecules and synthesized BAILs
were recorded. It was evident that the 1H NMR spectra contained
no undesirable peaks. The as prepared BAILs were pure and ready for
use in the esterification reaction.

4.2.3 Characterization of BAILs
Figure 7 shows the
molecular
structure of ILs used in this study. The molecular structure of BAILs
were confirmed from 1H NMR (Figure S6). The chemical shift in proton NMR of BAILs was observed
in the range of 0.05–0.4 ppm after protonation and because
of the influence of anions (Figure S6).
After the quarterization of pyridine, the aromatic proton of the zwitter
ion and BAILs was deshielded at higher ppm in the range of 0.2–1
ppm from the original position of aromatic proton of pyridine as shown
in Figure S7. The thermal stability of
pyridinium-based BAILs varied depending on anions. The onset degradation
temperature (Td) of BAIL-1, BAIL-2, BAIL-3,
and BAIL-4 were obtained at 310, 285, 280, and 271 °C, respectively
(Figure S8). BAIL-1 and BAIL-2 were found
in the liquid state at room temperature. BAIL-3 was found as glassy
liquids below 100 °C. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
curve displayed the melting point of BAIL-3 at 133 °C (Figure S9). Similarly, the melting point of BAIL-4
was found to be 94 °C. The Hammett acidity function (Ho) of BAILs was examined from UV–vis
spectroscopy using 4-nitroaniline as the probe. The Ho value of synthesized BAILs was in good agreement as
literature reports.40 The variation of
the Ho value also depends upon the concentration
of BAILs. Here, we recorded the UV–vis spectra in methanol
of the 4-nitroaniline probe and BAILs with the concentrations 7.5
× 10–5 and 5 × 10–2 mol
L–1, respectively. The UV–vis spectra are
given in Figure S10. The Hammett acidity
function (Ho) is summarized in Table S1. The Brønsted acidity decreased
in this order H2SO4 ≥ BAIL-2 ≈
BAIL-1 > BAIL-3 > BAIL-4. The Brønsted acidity of BAIL-1(Ho = 0.94) and BAIL-2 (Ho = 0.93) were found comparable to H2SO4 (Ho = 0.90). Therefore, both BAILs were
observed to be more efficient for esterification compared to BAIL-3
and BAIL-4.

4.2.4 Hammett Acidity of BAILs
The Hammett
acidity function of BAILs were determined by spectroscopic techniques
using a 4-nitroaniline probe (pKa = 0.99)
as per our previous report.41 This is useful
information in terms of the estimation of Brønsted acidity of
ILs. A basic probe was used as the trap of dissociative proton of
BAILs in methanol. The probe solution was prepared in methanol having
a concentration (7.5 × 10–5 mol L–1), and the BAIL concentration (5 × 10–2 mol
L–1) was added in the probe solution. The solution
was stirred for 2 h, after which the absorbance of solution was recorded.
The Hammett acidity function (Ho) values
of BAILs were calculated from eq 1 (Table S1). 1  where, pKa is
the value of the indicator [I] corresponding to the molar concentration
of the unprotonated form of the probe and [IH+] is the
protonated form of the probe. A decreasing intensity of absorbance
after protonation determined the Ho value.

4.2.5 General Procedure for Esterification of
LA with 2,3-Butanediol
In a typical reaction, 2,3-BDO (8.60
mmol, 0.775 g) and two equivalents of LA (17.22 mmol 2.0 g) were taken
in a vial with a catalytic amount of BAILs/H2SO4 (0.57 mmol). The reaction mixture was charged at different temperatures
(60–105 °C) in a preheated oil bath and samples were collected
at predefined time intervals. The collected samples were diluted by
ethyl acetate, neutralized using sodium bicarbonate and a small amount
of sodium sulfate was used for removal of water. Samples were injected
into GC for quantitative analysis. The conversion of 2,3-BDO, selectivity,
and yield were calculated from the formula given below. 2   3   4  where Ci and Cf are the
initial and final concentration (mmol)
of 2,3-BDO and Cp is concentration of
ester products.

4.2.6 Purification and Separation
of the Diester/Monoester
The upper phase ester products and
unreacted LA of the reaction
mixture were subjected to separation of the monoester and diester
in order to obtain pure products. A slurry (silica with ester products)
was packed in a silica column and the mixture of hexane and ethyl
acetate was used as a solvent with an increasing volume (5, 10, 15,
20 vol %) used to separate
and concentrate the monoester and diester. However, the monoester
and diester collectively eluded in the mixture of hexane with 15 vol
% ethyl acetate. As the next step, a liquid–liquid extraction
method was used to separate the monoester and diester by washing with
ethyl acetate and 0.1 M aqueous NaCl solution several times at room
temperature. The aqueous phase monoester was extracted by increasing
the concentration of (5 M) NaCl. The extracted products were dried
by rotary evaporation and finally in a Schlenk line at 50 °C
for 5 h. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
of obtained products. The NMR peaks confirmed the formation of the
diester and monoester product (Figure 1 and Figure S2c,d).

4.2.7 Products Analysis and Calibration Curve
The purified
monoester and diester products were injected in GC–FID
using ethyl acetate as a solvent, whereupon the purity of the monoester
and diester was found to be 95 and 95.7%, respectively. The calibration
curves of both esters were obtained using different concentrations.
The products were quantitatively analyzed by GC–FID (Agilent
6890 N) equipped with an HP-5 column (30 m length, 0.32 mm internal
diameter, and 0.25 m of film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier
gas. The GC injection port and the detector temperature were set at
250 °C. The following temperature program was used for the analysis:
initial column temperature was fixed at 50 °C. First, the program
was set with a rate of 4.5 °C min–1 up to 100
°C for no holding time. Second, the program was set from 100
to 300 °C with a rate of 20 °C min–1 and
held at this temperature for 7 min.
