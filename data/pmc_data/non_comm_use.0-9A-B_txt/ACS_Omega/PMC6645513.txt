Nanometallic surfaces of Ag nanoparticles
(NPs) catalyzed the self-aggregation
behavior of zein in different ordered morphologies such as cubes,
rectangles, and bars. This was studied in a ternary in situ reaction
(AgNO3 + zein + water), where zein performed the reduction
as well as stabilization of Ag NPs. This reaction produced small Ag
NPs of less than 10 nm predominantly bound with {111} crystal planes,
which attracted the surface adsorption of zein. Surface-adsorbed zein
initiated the protein seeding and converted the tertiary structure
of protein into open β-pleated structure with aqueous exposed
hydrophobic domains. A layered deposition of β-pleats on different
crystal planes of Ag NPs derived them to nearly monodispersed cubic
morphologies. The mechanistic aspects of self-aggregation of zein
in the presence of nanometallic surfaces hold possible scenarios for
simple and straightforward routes of protein crystallization.

Introduction
Protein crystallization
is an important aspect to understand the
structural and site specific biochemical reactions. It is usually
carried out in the aqueous phase with precise control of the ionic
strength, pH, temperature, and purity of the protein.1−3 Because protein is a macromolecule and its physiochemical properties
are highly protein-specific, a precise crystallization is quite tedious
and requires a control over wide range of experimental conditions.
Conventional protein crystallization is generally reported at the
micrometer or millimeter scale but it can be controlled at the nanometer
scale by generating suitable reaction conditions. Nanometallic surfaces
with specific crystal planes of small metallic nucleating centers
can be used to drive the ordered self-aggregation (that eventually
leads to crystallization) of proteins.4−7 A protein macromolecule is a complex entity
consisting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and hence prone
to undergo various specific and nonspecific interactions with free
surfaces.8−10 This process causes several conformational changes
in protein structure that eventually results in protein unfolding
and exposes hydrophobic domains to aqueous phase. It triggers protein–protein
interactions through seeding that leads to the onset of self-aggregation.11−14 This complex process is little understood and requires a proper
mechanistic approach to understand. It is particularly more prevalent
in predominantly water-insoluble or hydrophobic proteins which contain
high proportions of nonpolar amino acids. Thus, unraveling the mechanisms
of protein in self-assembled ordered morphologies may help us to understand
several complex scenarios associated about fibrillation as well as
amyloidosis mainly responsible for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
diseases.

Zein, a corn-starch well-studied protein, is one of
the common
example of hydrophobic proteins that is available in plenty with a
wide range of food and pharmaceutical applications. The hydrophobic
nature of zein is mainly due to the presence of leucine, alanine,
and proline that render it water-insoluble.15,16 It is categorized into four different classes viz. α, β,
γ, and δ based on its solubility, amino acid sequences,
and surface charges. α-Zein17 with
molecular mass of 21–25 kD is the most abundant fraction and
also contains large amounts of hydrophobic residues. We present a
simple and straight forward method of nanometallic-catalyzed self-aggregation
of zein in nanocube formation specifically in the presence of Ag nanoparticles
(NPs). The main objective of the study is to elucidate the mechanism
that how nanometallic surfaces and crystal structure18,19 promote the ordered self-aggregation of proteins in shape-controlled
morphologies with relevance to fibrillation with significant implications
in nanomedicine.

Results and Discussion
In Situ Synthesis of Zein
Nanocubes
In the Presence of Ag NPs
Table 1 lists different conditions under which zein
nanocubes are synthesized. Figure 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
of nanocubes of sample NC1 of ∼200 nm in size while the corresponding
transmission electron microscope (TEM) image is shown in Figure 1b. The overall morphology
of the nanocube is depicted by choosing two TEM images of single nanocube
in Figure 1c,d. In
both cases, Ag NPs are fully embedded in zein cubes and arranged in
a random fashion with overall size ∼10 nm while some of the
NPs appear merging with each other. The selected area diffraction
image in the inset of Figure 1c highlights the crystalline nature of Ag NPs. Energy dispersive
X-rays (EDX) analysis of zein nanocubes show a prominent emission
because of Ag apart from C, N, and O, the main elements of protein
structure (Figure 1e). Figure 1f depicts
the UV–visible plots of NC1, NC2, and NC3 samples (Table 1). The peak close
to 300 nm is probably originating from the self-assembled zein while
that at 510 nm is of immobilized Ag NPs in zein cubes. Free Ag NPs
in aqueous solution usually give absorbance because of surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) close to 410 nm.20 There
is practically no change in the position of SPR at 510 nm of entrapped
Ag NPs while the peak at 300 nm red shifts ∼15 nm with the
increase in the amount of zein from 0.3 to 0.4%. Sample NC1 is prepared
when zein is solubilized in 8 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) which
is the critical micelle concentration.21 Increase in the amount of SDS from 8 to 16 and then 20 mM further
facilitates the solubilization of zein by imparting greater degree
of unfolding.22 In other words, the degree
of unfolding is related to the amount of surfactant used. Figure 2a,b shows the SEM
images of samples NC2 and NC3 prepared by using 16 and 20 mM of SDS,
respectively. Both images show almost identical morphologies with
similar sizes. The sample specifications, size, and shape of all samples
made under in situ experimental conditions have been listed in Table 1. Microscopic imaging
data have been further compared with that from dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements. There is a fine correlation between the size evaluated
from the TEM (Table 1) and DLS (Figure S3) analysis. The zeta
potential of nanocubes from different samples is negative (Figure S4) and in the range of ∼(−40
to −60) mV. Negative zeta potential is obviously due to the
global negative charge on zein dissolved in aqueous SDS.22 2D X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis further
helps us to elucidate the ordered self-aggregation of zein. Here is
a composite of many scans at 2 theta equal 20 and psi 57° as
the sample is rotated (Figure 2c). The spots are from protein, with the bright ones in the
upper right nearly along the normal direction of the protean plane
in contact with the sample along with an integrated 2D plot (Figure 2c, inset). Texture
map (Figure 2d) from
a series of scans rocking through a specular reflection of 2 theta
equal to 22.8° shows that one family of protein planes is parallel
to the surface. The crystal structure of Ag NPs shows the face-centered
cubic lattice of Ag NPs (Figure 2e) with predominant growth at the {111} crystal planes.
It suggests that {111} crystal planes are in fact nanometallic surfaces
which promote the self-aggregation of zein.

Using Both
AgNO3 and HAuCl4
Interestingly,
when the above-mentioned in situ reaction in the presence of AgNO3 is conducted along with a small amount (0.25 mM) of HAuCl4 (Table 2), the monodisperse shape of nanocubes observed
previously is largely disturbed with much larger sizes and appearance
of different shapes such as bars, rectangles, and other less prominent
polyhedral morphologies (Figure 3). Now, zein also reduces Au(III) into Au(0) along
with the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0). As both reduction  reactions are occurring simultaneously
due
to the weak reducing ability of zein, nucleating centers created in
this way are the mixtures of both Ag and Au atoms with face-centered
cubic (fcc) geometry.23,24 They have different catalytic
behavior25,26 from Ag NPs that leads to the formation
of rectangles, bars, and distorted tetrahedrons. In addition, there
is a large variation in the size and shape of nanocubes and now nanocubes
of more than 1 μm are also present. Apart from the self-assembled
morphologies of zein, the reaction produces free Ag–Au bimetallic
triangular planar NPs of 200–300 nm in the solution (Figures S5 and S6), which are not entrapped in
zein nanocubes or any way associated with the self-assembled zein.
They are responsible for the dark purple color of the solution (Table 2) in comparison to
light yellow obtained only in the presence of Ag NPs (which are completely
entrapped by the nanocubes) (Table 1). Large nanocubes and rectangles entrapping small
NPs are shown in Figure 3c,d for the samples NC5 and NC6, respectively, while the EDX analysis
is shown in Figure 3e. EDX analysis show prominent emission from Ag while relatively
much weaker emission is coming from Au, along with that of Cl which
is the byproduct of HAuCl4.27 We will elaborate it further from the detailed EDX analysis.

Using the
Seed-Growth (S-G) Method to Produce NPs
In
the S-G method, seeds are first prepared and then are subjected to
growth conditions.18,19 Growth is the process where shape
and size are governed by the stabilizing agent that results in specific-shaped
NPs with specific crystal planes.18 Seeds
are practically small NPs usually of ∼10 nm in size (Figures S1 and S2). Freshly produced atoms during
the reduction reaction prefer to nucleate at the specific crystal
planes of seeds already present in the solution rather than generating
new nucleating centers.18 Therefore, different
crystal planes of growing seeds now provide the nanometallic surface
catalytic effects and hence provide entirely different route of mechanism
of self-assembled behavior of zein. We use both Au and Ag seeds in
different growth steps with a fixed amount of AgNO3 as
precursor in the presence of zein (Table 3). During the growth reaction, again zein
initiates the reduction of Ag(I) to produce Ag(0) which nucleates
on different crystal planes of seeds to produce Ag–Au bimetallic
NPs. The nanometallic surfaces of bimetallic NPs may further catalyze
the self-aggregation of zein. Figure 4 shows the SEM images of zein self-assembled morphologies
of samples NC7–NC10 (Table 3), while their respective TEM images are shown in Figures S7 and S8. Among various shapes, predominant
morphologies are cubes, rectangles, and bars, as observed previously
(Figure 3) for the
samples of Table 2,
where both AgNO3 and HAuCl4 are used. The main
difference between the morphologies of samples of Tables 2 and 3 is the size, which is much larger (∼1 μM) for the samples
of Table 2 rather than
that (∼300 nm) of Table 3. This suggests that the NPs synthesized without the S-G method
produce much bigger zein morphologies rather than with the S-G method.

Compositional
Analysis
C, N, and O, are the main elements
constituting the protein structure and contributing to maximum amount
in each case (Table 4). Samples NC1–NC3 (Table 1) apart from these elements also show the presence
of large amount of Ag in the form of Ag NPs. Therefore, the nanocubes
of Figures 1 and 2 are mainly consisting of these elements. When we
use both AgNO3 and HAuCl4 along with zein (samples
NC4 and NC5, Table 2), the nanocubes (Figure 3) are mainly made of Ag (43.4%) while the amount of Au (1.4%)
is too tiny in contrast to the bulk mole ratio 1:5 between Ag and
Au. Presence of 9.7% Cl is the byproduct of HAuCl4 (AuCl
→ 2Au + Cl2)27 and is
expected to form AgCl that may also exist in the form of nanocubes
with almost similar dimensions.28−30 On the other hand, the amount
of Cl (1.4%) produced is almost negligible when Au seeds and AgNO3 are used in the presence of zein (samples NC6 and NC7, Table 3). This tiny amount
of Cl is probably contributed27 by an unreacted
HAuCl4 during the synthesis of Au seeds. In fact, the NPs
entrapped in the nanocubes of samples NC6 and NC7 (Figure 4) are mainly made of Ag, whereas
amount of Au is almost negligible. Likewise, Ag seeds along with AgNO3 and in the presence of zein (samples NC8 and NC9, Table 3) should produce only
Ag NPs from the S-G method. Thus, elemental composition of all samples
indicates that the nanocubes are mainly made of zein along with Ag
NPs but also contain AgCl when HAuCl4 is used and the amount
of AgCl is proportional to the amount of Cl produced upon the decomposition
of HAuCl4. In addition, only the nanometallic surfaces
or crystal planes of Ag NPs catalyze the self-aggregation of zein
even in the samples NC4–NC7, where Au is used either in the
form of HAuCl4 or Au seeds. Hence, all results lead to
an overall single mechanism of the nanocube formation under different
conditions where only Ag nanometallic surfaces are involved in the
self-aggregation of zein. In addition, the overall composition of
zein in terms of C, N, and O is also largely affected because of the
reaction conditions demonstrated in Table 1, which dramatically alter the zein tertiary
structure. Surface adsorption of zein under different experimental
conditions also alters the seeding process that in turn causes a large
change in the protein composition.

Mechanism
The mechanism of nanocube formation consists
of two main steps (Figure 5). In the first step, Ag NPs are formed, and in the second
step, their nanometallic surfaces are involved in the ordered self-aggregation
of zein. Without the first step, the second step cannot go ahead at
its own because blank experiments without the presence of AgNO3 do not show any self-aggregation of zein. XRD patterns of
Ag NPs (Figure 2c)
confirm the fcc geometry with preferential growth along the ⟨111⟩
zone in the first step. Because the reaction is only a ternary reaction
with three components that is zein + AgNO3 + water, the
growth of the NPs is controlled by the solubilized zein which is negatively
charged because neutral zein is predominantly hydrophobic water-insoluble
protein and hence can only be dissolved in aqueous surfactant solution.
Anionic SDS micellar solution provides net negative charge to zein
because long hydrocarbon chains of the surfactant molecules penetrate
into the cylindrical hydrophobic domains10 while anionic surfactant head groups remain at the surface of zein
for aqueous solubilization. As a whole, solubilized zein protein becomes
an amphiphilic entity with negative charges at the surface while hydrophobic
domains are hidden inside (Figure 5a). The amphiphilic protein is highly susceptible for
the surface adsorption that is mainly driven by low lattice energy
of the NP surface.31−33 Adsorption on the low energy {111} crystal planes
brings unfolding (Figure 5b) and further increases the surface adsorption that does
not remain limited to that of {111} crystal planes because unfolded
zein with exposed hydrophobic domains prefers to adsorb on {110}/{100}
crystal planes.8,10 Thus, nanometallic surface-adsorbed
hydrophobic domains undergo hydrophobic interactions with aqueous
solubilized free zein as well as with the surface-adsorbed zein on
the neighboring NPs.8 Such protein–protein
interactions bring several layers of zein deposition on the nanometallic
surfaces (Figure 5c).
High temperature (80 °C) for 24 h in fact induces further dehydration
to the hydrophobic domains and increases the magnitude of nonpolar
interactions. Zein is a highly robust protein with cylindrical hydrophobic
domains. Surface adsorption opens the cylindrical hydrophobic domains
with layers of β-pleated sheets34,35 that contain
predominantly nonpolar amino acids. In fact, cubic morphologies are
the outcome of β-pleated layered packing around each NP which
then acts as a seed or nucleating center for the self-aggregation
of zein.10 When several adjoining NPs wrapped
with β-pleated sheets make small aggregates driven by the hydrophobic
interactions, a self-assembled cubic morphology of zein entrapping
Ag NPs emerges. The shape and size of the final morphology is the
result that how β-pleated sheets are packed around each NP.

Figure 5 (a–d)
Different steps of proposed mechanism of zein nanocube
formation.

Use of HAuCl4 along
with AgNO3 in this reaction
initiates other side reactions apart from the synthesis of Ag nucleating
centers. Ag+ ions interact electrostatically with negatively
charged zein and hence preferentially reduced in comparison to AuCl4– ions. Ag nucleating centers thus-produced
follow the same mechanism as discussed above and result in the formation
of Ag NPs entrapped zein nanocubes. These nanocubes indicate the presence
of a little amount of Au (Table 4), suggesting a parallel growth of Ag–Au bimetallic
nucleating centers into large nanoplates36,37 (∼200 nm, Figures S5 and S6),
which do not entrap in the zein nanocubes. Rather their flat surfaces
bound with {110}/{100} crystal planes are the ideal nanometallic surfaces
for the adsorption of hydrophobic domains. It further opens and facilitates
the layering of the β-pleated sheets that self-assemble into
much larger rectangles and bars along with cubes (Figure 3).38−40 Furthermore,
use of Au seeds (Table 3, samples NC6 and NC7) even does not help to produce Ag–Au
bimetallic NPs embedded in zein nanocubes because again a little amount
of Au is present in nanocubes while all entrapped NPs are only made
of Ag (Table 4). Thus,
self-assembled behavior of zein is primarily originating from the
Ag nanometallic surfaces and that is why the resulting zein nanocubes
only contain Ag NPs rather than Ag–Au bimetallic or Au NPs.
The formation of rectangles and bars are the manifestation of β-pleated
sheet self-aggregation behavior when a large amount of zein is surface-adsorbed.

Concluding Remarks
Ag nanometallic surfaces demonstrate
their excellent potential
for the surface adsorption and self-aggregation behavior of zein in
ordered morphologies. This is mainly achieved for predominantly hydrophobic
proteins such as zein, while other predominantly hydrophilic proteins
rarely show this behavior.41−43 In situ reaction conditions are
the best suited for the formation of monodisperse zein nanocubes when
Ag nucleating centers are created during the reaction and that allow
simultaneous preferential adsorption of zein on {111} crystal planes.
It initiates the seeding and protein–protein interactions to
deposit unfolded β-pleated layered structures on nanometallic
surfaces to generate ordered morphologies. Zein nanocubes entrap only
Ag NPs and do not entrap Ag–Au bimetallic NPs, indicating the
fact that Ag nanometallic surfaces are preferred over bimetallic.
This is most probably due to a change in the lattice structure which
is probably not that favorable for the surface adsorption of zein
in comparison to Ag nanometallic surface and requires further investigation.

Experimental
Chemicals
Zein protein (CAS # 9010-66-6), hydrogen
tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4), silver nitrate
(AgNO3), and SDS, all AR-grade obtained from Sigma–Aldrich,
were used as such without further purification. The double-distilled
water was used for all sample preparations.

Synthesis of Zein Nanocubes
Synthesis of zein nanocubes
was carried out by two methods. The first one is the in situ method
where no external reducing or stabilizing agents were used and zein
initiated the reduction as well as provided the colloidal stability.
By doing so, zein prompted the protein–protein interactions
to self-assemble in the form of nanocubes. In the second method, we
used the seed-growth (S-G) method,18,19 where seeds
grow into NPs while simultaneously allowing adsorption of zein on
different crystal planes of NPs that subsequently derived the seeding
process of protein to form self-assembled zein nanocubes.

In Situ Synthesis
In a round-bottom flask, 10 mL of
(0.1, 0.2, and 0.4%) zein (dissolved in a specified amount of SDS
aqueous solution) was taken along with AgNO3. The mixture
was shaken thoroughly for some time and kept in a thermostat bath
at constant 80 °C for 24 h. Zein initiated the reduction and
converted Ag(I) into Ag(0) with final pink to purple or yellow-brown
color.11 As soon as the Ag nucleating centers
were created, zein stabilized them by surface adsorption and limiting
growth proceeded to form tiny Ag NPs. The following reaction is expected
to take place within first few hours of the reaction. This is followed
by the protein–protein interactions  triggered by the surface-adsorbed
protein
that eventually self-assembled in the form of nanocubes. The samples
were kept overnight and purified by centrifugation at 11 000
rpm after washing couple of times with double-distilled water.

Seed-Growth
(S-G) Method
In this method, first of all
Au seeds were prepared by mixing solutions of 1 mM trisodium citrate
and 1 mM HAuCl4 followed by an addition of an ice cold
0.5 mL (0.1 M) sodium borohydride solution. The red color confirms
the formation of tiny Au seeds (Supporting Information, Figure S1), which were further used in the growth process. The
growth of seeds into NPs was initiated by taking required amount of
Au seeds in 10 mL of zein solution (0.1 and 0.2%) in the presence
of AgNO3 (0.25–1 mM) at 80 °C for 24 h. This
reaction allowed the reduction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) by zein, and Ag
atoms thus-created instantaneously nucleated on already present Au
seeds in the solution. Similar reactions were also performed by taking
Ag seeds (Figure S2) instead of Au seeds.
The NPs thus-produced catalyzed the adsorption of zein to initiate
protein–protein interactions that resulted in the self-assembled
morphologies of zein. The purification of self-assembled morphologies
of zein was carried out as mentioned in the previous method.

Instrumentation
The shape and size of zein self-assembled
morphologies were determined with the help of TEM analysis performed
on JEOL-2100 TEM, Japan. The sample was prepared by placing a drop
of suspension on carbon-coated copper grid, dried in air, and analyzed
at an operation voltage of 200 keV. Field-emission SEM analysis was
done on Carl Zeiss Supra 55 at an operating voltage 10 keV for SEM
images and 20 keV for EDX. Sample was prepared by placing the suspension
on a glass substrate and analyzed after silver coating. XRD analysis
was done on Shimadzu Maxima-X XRD, Japan. Sample was prepared by placing
a drop of sample suspension on the glass substrate and dried in air.
XRD patterns were collected at a wavelength of 1.54 Å (Cu Kα),
an operating voltage of 40 keV, and a scan speed of 4° per min.
Origin 6.1 and KaleidaGraph 3.5 were used to process and plot the
spectra.
