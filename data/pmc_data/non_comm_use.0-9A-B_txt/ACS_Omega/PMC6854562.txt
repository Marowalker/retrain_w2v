Following the development of organic
mechanoluminescence (ML) materials, molecular packing was proved as
the key point to the emission process under an external force. In
this text, with the introduction of spiro-(fluorene-9-9′-xanthene)
(SFX) unit as the building block, the molecular packing of the resultant
compound (BSFXA) was optimized with the interlaced mode, directly
leading to the efficient ML effect. The key role of SFX with a spiro-structure
can be further confirmed by the ML inactivity of reference compound
BFA with the replacement of SFX unit by dimethyl fluorene (MeF), which
provided a novel strategy to construct organic ML luminogens.

Introduction
Mechanoluminescence
(ML), the emission by the mechanical force without UV irradiation,
offers a feasible and promising solution to satisfy the increasing
need for sensors, displays, lighting, stress sensing, and security.1−5 Although ML phenomenon was first reported by Francis Bacon in 1605,
the pure organic ML luminogens are extremely rare compared to inorganic
compounds and organometallic complexes.6−8 Only a few examples have
been reported to display observable ML even at cryogenic temperatures
or in dark, which should be mainly due to the unclear inherent mechanisms
and lack of effective material design concept.9 In recent years, with the combination of the characteristic of aggregation-induced
emission (AIE), some organic ML materials have been explored with
strong emissions in solid state, and the basic AIE units with twisted
configuration act as the main building blocks (Chart S1), for instance, tetraphenylethene (TPE), diphenylamine
(DPA), and so on.10−18 Following the investigation of various organic luminogens possessing
the ML effect, the key role of molecular packing has been observed
in addition to the chemical structure, which could be confirmed by
opposite ML activities of two polymorphs based on a TPE derivative.19 Accordingly, the stuck packing is proved as
the preferred molecular packing, since the suppression of molecular
slippage as the energy loss was the key point to realize the ML process,
in addition to the piezoelectric effect.20−28 Thus, the optimization of molecular packing is essential to enhance
the ML activity of organic materials, which can be conducted by the
tunable molecular configurations and electronic properties.

Spiro-(fluorene-9-9′-xanthene) (SFX) unit, which consists
of xanthene and fluorene moieties with the connection by a sp3-hybridized carbon, exhibits the orthogonal geometry for the
spiro-structure.29−31 The SFX-based organic small molecules have been widely
used in organic optoelectronic materials with excellent photovoltaic
performance for the special molecular conformation and charge-transporting
property.32−35 Since the possible π–π interactions from the
two kinds of planar fused rings (xanthene and fluorene) with a nearly
perpendicular configuration, the interlocked packing mode can be formed
in the aggregated state, as proven by the crystal structure (Chart S2), which is much different from that
of the isolated fluorene unit with almost parallel arrangement and
in accordance with the preferred molecular packing of ML luminogens.36,37 Also, the oxygen atom in SFX can tune the electron property of the
whole unit and induce more intermolecular interactions in the aggregated
state, favoring the possible emission process for the suppression
of molecular motions as a nonradiative process.38

With the above considerations in mind, the SFX unit
was incorporated into the organic ML molecule with the linkage of
DPA and borate functional group to form the compound BSFXA. A similar
molecule with the replacement of the SFX fragment by one-dimensional
dimethyl fluorene (MeF) was also synthesized for comparison, with
the structure presented in Chart 1. Really, as expected, BSFXA and BFA demonstrated a
totally different ML property: BSFXA is ML-active, while BFA is not,
which is mainly due to the varied molecular packing with the presence
or absence of the spiro-structure. Herein, we would like to present
the synthesis, characterization, crystal structures, and mechanoluminescence
activity of BSFXA and BFA in detail.

Results
and Discussion
Design and Synthesis
The synthetic
routes of target molecules are illustrated in Scheme 1. First, monobromide intermediates were synthesized
by classical Buchwald–Hartwig C–N coupling reaction
of the SFX/MeF dibromide and DPA. After monobromide intermediates
in 1,4-dioxane solution had reacted with 4,4,4′,4′,5,5,5′,5′-octamethyl-2,2′-bi(1,3,2-dioxaborolane),
K2CO3 and Pd(dppf)2Cl2 at 85 °C, the target molecules were obtained and characterized
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high-resolution
mass spectrum (HRMS), and elemental analysis (Figures S1−S12). Compound BFA and BSFXA exhibited a
good thermal stability from the thermogravimetric analysis curves
(Figure S13), and the decomposition temperature
(Td) of BSFXA is higher than 260 °C.

Optical Properties
The UV–vis absorption spectra of BFA and BSFXA were measured
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions (Figure 1a) with peaks located at 366 and 372 nm,
respectively. The slight red-shifted absorption of BSFXA is mainly
due to the possible spiro-conjugation of the SFX unit, which is in
agreement with the trend of energy gap calculated by density functional
theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level (Figure 1b and Table S1).39 Also, BSFXA exhibited a red-shifted
emission peak located at 462 nm, in comparison with that of BFA at
451 nm (Figure 1c).
Their photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (ΦF)
and fluorescence lifetimes (τ) were measured in THF solutions
(Figure 1d), and BSFXA
showed a relatively higher PL efficiency (21.12%) than that of BFA
(15.83%). However, the fluorescence lifetime of BSFXA (2.12 ns) is
shorter than that of BFA (3.62 ns); accordingly, the radiation rate
(kr) of BSFXA is calculated to be 9.96
× 107 S–1, higher than that of BFA
(4.37 × 107 S–1), and the nonradiation
rates (knr) of BSFXA and BFA are 37.19
× 107 and 23.24 × 107 S–1, respectively (Figure 1d and Tables S1−S4).

decay curves for BFA (excited at 451 nm) and BSFXA (excited at 462

Subsequently, their light emission
properties in different solid states have been investigated (Figure 2a,b). Compared to
the emission in solution, the slightly broader spectra in aggregated
state might be due to the strong intermolecular interactions. However,
the emissive behaviors exhibited subtle changes for samples in different
solid states, including crystal, as prepared, and after being ground.
The fluorescence of the as-prepared BFA could keep its original blue
emission (448–452 nm) after grinding and turned to cyan one
upon crystallized (467 nm). However, the PL spectra of BSFXA exhibited
little changes in different solid states, which should be related
to the less molecular motions under mechanical force.40 These luminescence properties can be reversible or semireversible
by fuming processes (Figure S14). Furthermore,
it showed a much stronger emission as a crystal with the ΦF value of 40.43%, compared to that of BFA (16.34%), mainly
due to the higher radiation rates of BSFXA (144.23 × 107 S–1) than that of BFA (37.94 × 107 S–1); this trend can be kept irrespective whether
the solid was as prepared or ground. The better luminescence property
of BSFXA should be ascribed to the optimized molecular packing in
the solid state. The ΦF values of the two luminogens
increased during the grinding of the prepared solid, from 9.55 to
12.37% for BFA and from 28.09 to 40.06% for BSFXA, accompanied by
the change in the fluorescence lifetimes from 0.86 to 1.59 ns for
BFA and 1.85 to 2.30 ns for BSFXA. Accordingly, the nonradiation rates
decreased from 105.13 × 107 to 55.11 × 107 S–1 for BFA and from 38.86 × 107 to 26.06 × 107 S–1 for
BSFXA, as well as the radiation rates decreased from 11.10 ×
107 to 7.78 × 107 S–1 for BFA and from 15.18 × 107 to 17.42 × 107 S–1 for BSFXA (Table S4).

ML Behavior of BSFXA
With the aim to estimate the possible ML property, we scraped the
solid samples of BFA and BSFXA heavily at room temperature. Clearly,
BSFXA was ML-active but BFA was not; in detail, obvious cyan light
was observed for BSFXA under mechanical force, even under daylight
(Figure 3a), while
no emission can be generated from BFA. The ML spectrum of BSFXA matched
well with its PL one (Figure 3b), meaning that the similar excitation state was achieved
by mechanical force and UV irradiation. Subsequently, powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) spectra were recorded to investigate different
ML properties of these two luminogens (Figures 3c and S15), and
BSFXA crystal exhibited a much better compressive resistance than
that of BFA for the maintainable crystalline state even after grinding
heavily, which was beneficial to the ML effect, and related to the
molecular packing in the crystal, and their varied packing modes and
intermolecular interactions have been further confirmed by the theory
calculation with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method
(Figures S16 and S17).

Crystal Structures and Molecular Packing
Single crystals
of BFA and BSFXA were cultured by slowly evaporating their solution
in a solvent mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol, with the related
information listed in Table S5. The unit
cell of BFA was centrosymmetric with a space group of P121/c1, while that of BSFXA was non-centrosymmetric
with the space group of P1̅. Normally, the
non-centrosymmetric packing can be favorable to obtaining the piezoelectric
property, which could generate the electronic discharge upon mechanical
stimulation, directly resulting in the dye excitation and generation
of ML phenomenon. In detail, as to the BFA crystal, the head-to-head
and tail-to-tail packing modes were found, with the relatively loose
parallel or antiparallel arrangement (Figure 4a). However, the tight packing existed in
the BSFXA crystal with the interlaced mode (Figure 4b), and the locked function is mainly from
the SFX unit bearing the perpendicular moiety to the conjugation skeleton.
These two different packing modes then demonstrated varied responses
under mechanical stimulus. For BFA in a parallel arrangement, it would
lead to the molecular slippage under the action of a force, resulting
in the energy loss. As a consequence, nearly no ML can be observed
in this case. However, the molecular motions in the BSFXA crystal
have been locked by the adjacent molecules with stuck packing mode
in a large degree. Thus, the mechanical force was easy to be converted
into light emission for largely reduced energy loss via nonradiative
relaxation channels.

mode of (a) BFA and (b) BSFXA. The unit cell and related molecular
configurations of (c) BFA and (d) BSFXA.

In addition, intermolecular interactions in the crystals also play
a vital role in ML property. There were no π–π
interactions in these two crystals for the twisted molecular configurations
with the incorporation of DPA moieties. However, many C–H···O
and C–H···B interactions could be observed in
these crystals. To simplify crystal analyses, only the strong intermolecular
interactions with the distance shorter than 4.0 Å are emphasized,
and the corresponding results are presented in Figure 4c,d and Tables S6 and S7. There were three kinds of dimers in the unit cell of BFA
and BSFXA crystals, marked as F1, F2, and F3 and SFX1, SFX2, and SFX3,
respectively. In the SFX1 form, there are three types of strong C–H···O
interactions with the distance as short as 2.77 Å and two kinds
of C–H···N interactions with the distance of
3.73 and 3.92 Å, respectively. Similarly, one type of C–H···O
interaction (2.85 Å) and C–H···B interaction
(3.61 Å), as well as two types of strong C–H···π
interactions (3.82 and 3.83 Å), were found in the SFX2 form.
As for SFX3 form, it showed the strongest intermolecular interactions;
in detail, it contained three types of C–H···π
ranging from 2.97 to 3.49 Å, two types of strong C–H···B
interactions (3.58 and 3.94 Å) and one type of C–H···O
interaction (3.45 Å). Thus, in the BSFXA crystal, the strong
intermolecular interactions mostly existed in the SFX1 and SFX3 forms,
among which, two kinds of strong intermolecular interactions were
derived from the SFX unit with close distance (2.774 and 3.616 Å).
However, in the BFA crystal, strong intermolecular interactions mainly
existed in the F1 form, including one type of C–H···π
interaction (3.36 Å) and five types of C–H···O
bonds with distances ranging from 2.71 to 3.87 Å. Furthermore,
one type of C–H···O bond (2.15 Å) existed
in the F2 form and F3 form contained one type of C–H···O
bond (3.60 Å) and three types of C–H···O
bonds, with distances ranging from 2.31 to 3.95 Å. Obviously,
the much stronger molecule–molecule interactions in the BSFXA
crystal resulted in a more compact molecular packing with high rigidity,
favoring the efficient conversion of mechanical force to light emission;
also, the spiro-structure of the SFX unit plays the key role to popular interactions among adjacent molecules
and optimize the molecular packing with stuck mode.

Conclusions
In summary, a new ML luminogen (BSFXA) bearing spiro-(fluorene-9-9′-xanthene)
(SFX) moiety was reported with an obvious blue emission by mechanical
stimulus, while the similar compound (BFA) with dimethyl fluorene
(MeF) instead of SFX was ML inactive. Through careful investigation
of their optical property in different conditions, crystal structures,
together with theory calculations, SFX with spiro-structure was proved
as the main contributor to the optimized molecular packing and strengthened
intermolecular interactions of BSFXA in solid state, resulting in
the efficient conversion of mechanical force to light emission by
the suppression of possible molecular slippage under external force.
This is the first time for the spiro-structure as the main building
block to ML luminogens, possibly affording an efficient strategy to
expand the ML family by the rational molecular design.
