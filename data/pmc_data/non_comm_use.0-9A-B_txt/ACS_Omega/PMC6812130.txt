The multilayer 1T-TaSe2 is successfully synthesized
by annealing a Se-implanted Ta thin film on the SiO2/Si
substrate. Material analyses confirm the 1T (octahedral) structure
and the quasi-2D nature of the prepared TaSe2. Temperature-dependent
resistivity reveals that the multilayer 1T-TaSe2 obtained
by our method undergoes a commensurate charge-density wave (CCDW)
transition at around 500 K. This synthesis process has been applied
to synthesize MoSe2 and HfSe2 and expanded for
synthesis of one more transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) material.
In addition, the main issue of the process, that is, the excess metal
capping on the TMD layers, is solved by the reduction of thickness
of the as-deposited metal thin film in this work.

Introduction
Monolayer transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unique physical
properties are two-dimensional (2D) materials of a new generation
following the advent of graphene. TMDs can be mainly categorized into
semiconducting and metallic materials, resulting from different elemental
compositions and crystal structures. Initially, the semiconducting
TMDs such as 2H (trigonal prismatic)-MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 were widely investigated and
developed for various kinds of applications since their band gaps
do not change significantly under the transition from indirect to
direct as the monolayer limit is reached. For example, the states
of the conduction band at the K point in MoS2 are composed
of d orbitals on Mo atoms and localized between S atomic layers, inferring
that they are almost not influenced by the interlayer coupling. On
the contrary, the states close to the Γ point in MoS2 primarily arise from the hybridized d orbitals on Mo atoms and the
antibonding pz orbitals on S atoms, implying
that they are more sensitive to the thickness due to the strong interlayer
coupling. Therefore, the indirect band gap along the K−Γ
direction increases with decreasing number of layers, while the direct
band gap along the K–K direction is nearly unchanged. Initially,
Radisavljevic et al.1 successfully fabricated
single-layer MoS2 transistors, and Larentis et al.2 studied back-gated MoSe2 field-effect
transistors (FETs). Afterward, the WS2-based FET on a SiO2/Si substrate was announced by Georgiou et al.,3 and the in-plane p–n diode of ambipolar
WSe2 by electrostatic gating was accomplished by Baugher
et al.4 Apart from the semiconducting TMDs,
the metallic ones including 1T (octahedral)-TaS2, TiSe2, and VS2 were also studied in order to realize
their physical properties for particular applications.5−9 The charge-density wave (CDW) transition, a structural distortion
similar to the Peierls distortion in one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials,
has been discovered in most of metallic TMDs, especially TaSe2.10,11

Metallic TaSe2, naturally
existing in various allotropes
such as 1T, 2H, and 3R (trigonal prismatic) structures,12 possesses complex behaviors in the CDW phase
transitions.13 Initially, it was demonstrated
that the bulk TaSe2 stays at the normal state under higher
temperature and goes through incommensurate CDW (ICDW) and commensurate
CDW (CCDW) states in sequence with decreasing temperature.10,11 Thus, there are two phase transition temperatures, which are different
between the bulk 1T and 2H-TaSe2.14 In recent years, the CDW phase transitions of monolayer and multilayer
TaSe2, which would be distinct from those of bulks, have
been extensively investigated for potential applications in the future.
The current switching device driven by a voltage-controlled phase
transition between CDW states of TMDs is a popular application in
this field.15 The CDW states in monolayer
tantalum dichalcogenides were simulated by using density function
theory (DFT) calculations.16 The fundamental
properties of monolayer and multilayer TaSe2 including
band structures, crystal structures, and lattice vibration modes were
theoretically predicted by Yan et al.13 A small spin–orbit scattering length (17 nm) and a large
breakdown current density (3.7 × 107 A/cm2) of exfoliated 2H-TaSe2 flakes were determined by Neal
et al., indicating its high potential for the application of spintronic
devices.17 Moreover, the CDW states and
superconductivity of TaSe2 crystals doped by different
elements such as S, Te, Ti, and Cu have also been experimentally researched
and discussed.18−22 Interestingly, a 2H-TaSe2 thin film contacted with Ti/Au
as the electrodes exhibits a current–voltage characteristic
of an abrupt transition from highly resistive state to conductive
one, which may be useful for the radiation-hard logic circuits.23

So far, most of the studies have utilized
exfoliated TMDs for device
fabrication, implying that the thickness of TMDs cannot be precisely
controlled and the area of them is limited. The chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) method was also developed for the growth of TMDs on SiO2/Si substrates.24−26 Unfortunately, optical microscope
(OM) and/or atomic force microscope (AFM) images of TMD triangular
flakes obtained by CVD growth indicate that those TMD films are noncontinuous
even though it was claimed that their dimensions are larger than 100
μm.27−29 The noncontinuous film seriously prevents the real
applications in industry. On the other hand, SiO2 would
be corroded by S or Se, resulting in losing its insulating capability
for further device fabrication; hence, a transfer step seriously deteriorating
the quality of TMD films is still inevitable. Another synthesis method
based on sulfurization or selenization of transition metal or transition-metal
oxide films can achieve wafer-scale continuous TMD films. Actually,
the quality of TMD films synthesized by this method is controversial
since the crystallinity of deposited metal or metal oxide thin films
is not good enough and they could not be uniformly sulfurized or selenized
owing to a diffusion-limited reaction. As a result, the inhomogeneity
might be the main cause leading to the TMD FETs with the carrier mobility
as low as 10 cm2/(V·s).30 Previously, we have developed an innovative process using Se ion
beams to directly synthesize a uniform large-scale MoSe2 thin film on sapphire.31 All of the analytical
results confirm that the Mo film is selenized by the implanted Se
ions during the thermal treatment to form MoSe2 layers
on a sapphire substrate.31 Furthermore,
we have successfully expanded this technique for the synthesis of
multilayer HfSe2 to investigate its band structure by using
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and comparing with the calculation
results.32 However, the excess metal at
the surface after the process cannot be accurately removed without
etching of TMDs because the etching agent with high selectivity cannot
be found. In this report, the ion beam technique is applied to synthesize
a large-scale 1T-TaSe2 thin film on SiO2/Si.
It is noted that the thickness of the Ta thin film is reduced to overcome
the issue of excess metal and the sapphire substrate is replaced with
SiO2/Si in order to approach industrial applications.

Results
and Discussion
The Raman spectrum of the Se-implanted Ta
thin film on SiO2/Si without any peaks is shown in Figure 1a. After annealing,
there are two Raman peaks
obviously appearing in the spectrum as shown in Figure 1b. The Eg and A1g peaks
corresponding to the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice vibrations
of 1T-TaSe2 are located at ∼162 and ∼230
cm–1, respectively, which is in agreement with the
computational results.13 Herein, the positions
of Raman peaks of 1T and 2H-TaSe2 should be discussed and
realized. According to the literature, the Raman spectrum of 2H-TaSe2 may be consistent with that of theoretical prediction.13,17,23,33 Nevertheless, it seems that there are discrepancies between the
experimental and computational results of Raman analysis of 1T-TaSe2. Samnakay et al.12 claimed that
the E2g and A1g Raman peaks of 1T-TaSe2 emerge at positions of ∼177 and ∼187 cm–1, respectively; agreeing with the previous results.34,35 In fact, the results from the old references cited by them only
exhibit a quite weak signal close to ∼190 cm–1, which might be the A1g Raman peak indicated by them,
and the E2g Raman peak at ∼177 cm–1 assigned by them is absent.34,35 In addition, there
are theoretically not any active modes in the Raman spectra of 1T
and 2H-TaSe2 within the range of 170–200 cm–1.13 As mentioned above,
there were some issues concerning the Raman analysis of 1T-TaSe2 in the past. Therefore, it is reasonable that the spectrum
of Figure 1b initially
confirms the formation of 1T-TaSe2 layers on SiO2/Si via our process.

Figure 2a shows
the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) mapping of the sample after
our process with the optimized parameters. In order to first obtain
the work function of the probe (φp), Au was used
as the reference to measure the average difference of work function
(φd) between Au and the probe. Thus, the work function
of the probe (φp) could be calculated for deriving
that of the as-synthesized materials since the work function of Au
(φAu) has been known as 5.1 eV. As can be seen in Figure 2a, the work function
of TaSe2, deduced from the average difference of work function
(φm) between TaSe2 and the probe (Supporting Information), is around 5.1 eV, close
to the value extracted from the results of ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS).36 Besides, the KPFM
mapping also displays the good uniformity of the TaSe2 thin
film synthesized by our process. The Ta 4f X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectrum of the surface of TaSe2 on SiO2/Si shown in Figure 2b apparently reveals that there are four main peaks related to the
Ta–Se and Ta–O bonding.22 The weaker Ta–O peaks of 4f7/2 (∼27 eV)
and 4f5/2 (∼29.2 eV) are caused by the inevitable
oxidation under atmosphere. The intense Ta–Se peaks of 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 are located at ∼22.4 and ∼24.4
eV, respectively, implying that the TaSe2 synthesized in
this work belongs to 1T rather than the 2H phase.37 The Ta 4f photoemission spectrum of 1T-TaSe2, fitted by using the six Doniach–Sunjic line shapes, was
obtained by Horiba et al.37 Their fitting
results indicate that each Ta–Se peak is composed of three
subpeaks (A, B, and C subpeaks) corresponding to three Ta sites (A,
B, and C sites) in the lattice. Among these subpeaks, the binding
energy of A is close to that of B, while the binding energy of C is
averagely ∼0.75 eV higher than those of A and B. Actually,
the positions of Ta–Se peaks in Figure 2b conform to those in ref (37). It looks like each Ta–Se
peak in ref (37) splits
into two bands containing A, B, and C subpeaks; however, it seems
that the three subpeaks merge together in Figure 2b. This dissimilarity should result from
the instruments with different resolutions since the photoemission
analysis in ref (37) was carried out by using an angle-resolved photoemission spectrometer
(ARPES). The KPFM and XPS results further make sure that the TaSe2 synthesized in this study possesses the 1T structure.

4f XPS spectrum of the surface of 1T-TaSe2 on SiO2/Si.

The cross-sectional transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image
in Figure 3a clearly
shows a uniform bilayer on the SiO2/Si substrate. The top
layer should be the multilayer 1T-TaSe2 with a thickness
of ∼10 nm, while the bottom one may be the damaged SiO2 layer, caused by the ion beam irradiation, with a thickness
of less than 10 nm. The higher magnification image exhibits that multilayer
1T-TaSe2 with an interplanar spacing of ∼0.64 nm
is polycrystalline. The SRIM (the stopping and range of ions in matter)
simulation of the depth distribution of Se in the 10 nm-Ta/SiO2 structure is in agreement with the TEM result. As can be
seen in Figure 3b,
almost all of the Se ions are accumulated in the 10 nm-Ta thin film
owing to the low implantation energy. Only a few Se ions penetrate
into the SiO2, resulting in the damaged layer. Figure 3c shows the high-resolution
(HR) TEM image of 1T-TaSe2 from the region surrounded by
the dashed line in Figure 3a. The diffraction pattern processed by fast Fourier transform
(FFT) in the inset of Figure 3c indicates that the zone axis is [210]. The simulation of
the HRTEM image and diffraction pattern of 1T-TaSe2 in Figure 3d seems to be consistent
with that in Figure 3c. The interplanar distances derived from the diffraction patterns
in Figure 3c,d should
be utilized for further structure identification. As a result of calculations
(Supporting Information), the real (1̅20)
and (001) interplanar distances, which are equal to ∼0.18 and
∼0.64 nm, respectively, are in agreement with the theoretical
values (∼0.174 and ∼0.627 nm). The lines representing
the (1̅20) and (001) plane groups in the diffraction pattern
of Figure 3c are perpendicular
to each other (Supporting Information),
corresponding to the angle between the (1̅20) and (001) planes
that is certainly 90° as shown in the atomic model of Figure 3e. Moreover, the
interplanar spacing (∼0.64 nm) of multilayer 1T-TaSe2 directly estimated from the TEM image of Figure 3a implies that these crystal planes belong
to the (001) plane groups. Combining the Raman and XPS spectra together
with KPFM and TEM results, we can conclude that the polycrystalline
thin film synthesized in this study is indeed multilayer 1T-TaSe2.

Beyond the material identification, the relationship between resistivity
(ρ) of multilayer 1T-TaSe2 and temperature (T) was measured in order to comprehend the electronic phase
transition of 1T-TaSe2 obtained in this study. Figure 4a shows the temperature
dependence of resistivity of 1T-TaSe2 on SiO2/Si below room temperature. The resistivity of multilayer 1T-TaSe2 at 5 K, which is ∼2.2 × 10–1 mΩ·cm, initially remains nearly the same with temperature
until ∼30 K. Then it linearly increases with temperature to
∼2.55 × 10–1 mΩ·cm as the
room temperature is reached. For the measurements above room temperature
(Figure 4b), another
sample synthesized by our process under the same conditions was measured
in another system. Although the resistivity value at 300 K in Figure 4b is a little different
from that in Figure 4a, the inconsistency between them is reasonable and acceptable for
different samples. In Figure 4b, the resistivity of multilayer 1T-TaSe2 slightly
increases with temperature from 300 to 450 K. It is kept at a maximum
value within the range of 450–500 K and then decreases as the
temperature is higher than 500 K, suggesting that the transition temperature
of normal metal-CCDW of the multilayer 1T-TaSe2 is around
500 K. Roughly, the tendency of the ρ–T curve in Figure 4 is similar to that
in ref (20). Consequently,
the multilayer 1T-TaSe2 obtained in this work similarly
behaves as the bulk one in the electronic phase transition.20

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the multilayer TaSe2 has been successfully
synthesized on a SiO2/Si substrate by using the ion beam
technique for the first time. The results of material analysis demonstrate
that the TaSe2 obtained by our method possesses the 1T
structure indeed. The temperature dependence of resistivity indicates
the behavior in the electronic phase transition in which the normal
metal-CCDW transition temperature is around 500 K. In this study,
it is worth noting that the process based on ion implantation for
the synthesis of TMDs has been improved by reducing the thickness
of the as-deposited Ta film to prevent the excess Ta at the surface
after annealing.

Experimental Section
A 4 in. Si
(100) wafer capped by 100 nm SiO2 was chosen
as the substrate on which an ∼10 nm Ta thin film was deposited
by radio frequency (RF) sputtering at room temperature. Then the Se
ions (10 keV, 1.5 × 1016 ions/cm2) created
from Se pellets were implanted into the Ta/SiO2/Si wafer
by a medium current ion implanter (ULVAC, IMX3500). The dose and energy
of implantation were estimated by the SRIM simulation in advance.
Eventually, the cut samples were annealed at 900 °C with a temperature
increasing rate of 20 °C/min in the N2/H2 (6/1, v/v) ambiance for 1 h. A confocal micro-Raman spectrometer
(HORIBA, LabRAM, HR800 UV) with a He-Ne laser of 632.8 nm wavelength
and 35 mW power was employed to initially check the formation of TaSe2 layers. The Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) of the peak
force mode in an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker, Dimension Icon)
was used to measure the work function of the as-synthesized TaSe2. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Ulvac-PHI, VersaProbe
II) was utilized to analyze the surface composition. The nanoscale
layer structure was observed by using a spherical-aberration corrected
transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-ARM200FTH) with 0.1
nm resolution of the lattice image and 200 kV accelerated voltage.
The resistivities of the multilayer TaSe2 were measured
by using the van der Pauw method in the two systems of Hall measurement.
The first system (Lake Shore, HMS-9709A) was applied to the measurement
at temperatures below 300 K, while the other (Ecopia, HMS-3000) was
used for those higher than room temperature. Indium balls were used
as the electrodes for the Hall measurements.
