Lead chalcogenide
quaternary systems have been shown to provide
high thermoelectric (TE) efficiency superior to those of binary and
ternary lead chalcogenides, arising from both altered electronic band
structures and a reduction in lattice thermal conductivity. Here,
we have synthesized single-phase samples of the quaternary compound
(PbTe)0.55(PbS)0.1(PbSe)0.35 doped
with Na and characterized their TE properties. We show that the dopant
solubility is limited to 1 at. %. A very low lattice thermal conductivity
of ∼0.6 W m–1 K–1 at 850
K is achieved at all dopant concentrations because of phonon scattering
from point defects associated with solute atoms with high contrast
atomic mass. As a result, a high TE figure of merit of approximately
1.5 is achieved at 823 K in heavily doped samples. Moreover, the figure
of merit is greater than 1 over a wide temperature range above 675
K.

Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) materials have attracted
much research interest
over the past decade, driven by the concerns arising from the energy
crisis and global warming.1 The efficiency
of TE materials is generally characterized by the TE figure of merit, zT, which is defined by zT = (S2σT)/κ, where S, σ, κ, and T are the Seebeck coefficient,
electrical conductivity, total thermal conductivity, and absolute
temperature, respectively.2 Some of the
highest TE efficiencies at mid-range temperatures (500–900
K) have been achieved in lead chalcogenide materials3−9 that are rich in PbTe. However, the scarcity of tellurium implies
that it is essential to search for new systems comprising more earth-abundant
elements that exhibit complex chemistry that can lead to high zTs.10,11 Therefore, the focus of our research
here is to identify complex lead chalcogenide systems with reduced
tellurium content but without sacrificing the performance.12−14

Ternary systems of PbTe–PbSe4,15,16 and PbTe–PbS14,17−19 have been shown to exhibit higher figures of merit
than binary PbQ
(Q = Te, Se, and S) compounds in the temperature range of 550–800
K. The high TE performance of PbTe–PbSe alloys originates from
both alteration of the electronic band structure and reduced lattice
thermal conductivity due to point defects.4,16,20 Meanwhile, the higher figures of merit achieved
in PbTe–PbS alloys are attributed to a reduction in lattice
thermal conductivity because of phonon scattering at the interfaces
of secondary phases, as the solubility of PbS in the PbTe matrix is
limited.21 The TE performance of single-phase
quaternary compounds (PbTe)1–x−y(PbS)x(PbSe)y is superior to those of both binary PbQ (Q = Te,
Se, and S) and ternary PbTe–PbSe and PbTe–PbS systems,22−26 although at low concentrations of PbS and PbSe (x and y < 0.1). This is due to enhanced Seebeck
coefficients originating from a larger density of state (DOS) effective
mass and band gap, as well as reduced lattice thermal conductivity
due to the phonon scattering that arises from solute atoms with high
contrast in atomic mass.22,23 The presence of PbSe
in quaternary compounds increases the solubility of PbS in PbTe, which
results in tuning the electronic band structure,22,23 and might also reduce the thermal conductivity further.

The
quaternary samples of previous studies were all doped with
Na+ at a constant concentration, replacing 2% of Pb2+.22−25,27 Every sodium cation introduces
one hole in the valence band. Sodium has been shown to be an effective
dopant for Pb chalcogenides; its maximum solubility in PbS (≈2
at. %) is higher than that in PbSe (≈0.9 at. %) and much higher
than that in PbTe,28 which shows a solubility
limit of ≈0.7 at. %.29 In the present
work, we have synthesized single-phase quaternary (PbTe)0.55(PbS)0.1(PbSe)0.35 compounds, with a higher
concentration of PbSe compared to previous reports,22−24 at various
Na dopant concentrations. The higher PbSe and PbS content increases
the sodium solubility limit compared to PbTe-rich systems.16 The band gap of the undoped compound is 0.319
eV, which is higher than those of PbTe (0.29 eV) and PbSe (0.27 eV)
and lower than that of PbS (0.41 eV).30 We find a low-lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.6 W m–1 K–1 at 850 K for all samples. Moreover,
a high figure of merit of ∼1.5 is achieved at 823 K in both
lightly and heavily-doped samples with 55% Te on the anion site, which
is higher than the maximum zT obtained for PbTe (1.4).4

Results and Discussion
Powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the Pb1–xNaxSe0.35S0.1Te0.55 (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03
and 0.035) samples are consistent with a single-phase, face-centered
cubic rock salt structure (Figure 1). The refined lattice parameters are 6.3020(2), 6.3111(2),
6.3002(2), and 6.2948(1) Å for the x = 0.01,
0.02, 0.03, and 0.035 samples, respectively. The lattice of these
quaternary compounds contracts relative to that of pure PbTe (a = 6.46 Å) because of simultaneous alloying with PbSe
(a = 6.13 Å) and PbS (a = 5.93
Å). However, there is no clear trend of a lattice parameter with
Na content as the ionic radius of Na+ (116 pm) is very
close to that of Pb2+ (119 pm). A fit to the XRD pattern
of the x = 0.03 sample is shown in Figure 1. The XRD profile is not fitted
perfectly, which is mainly due to anisotropic peak broadening that
is difficult to model accurately. This might reflect nanoscale defects
in the underlying nanostructure.

Figure 1 Observed (black data points), fitted (red
line), and different
(blue line) room-temperature XRD patterns of Pb1–xNaxSe0.35S0.1Te0.55 (x = 0.03). The inset
shows the XRD patterns of samples x = 0.01, 0.02,
0.03, and 0.035.

Table 1 shows the
room-temperature Hall carrier concentration and mobility for the Pb1–xNaxSe0.35S0.1Te0.55 (x =
0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.035) samples. The Hall coefficients, RH, are positive for all the samples at room
temperature, which indicates p-type conductivity. The Hall carrier
concentration, n, and Hall mobility, μ, were
obtained from the Hall coefficient measurement, using n = 1/(eRH) and μ = σRH, where e is the electronic
charge and σ is the electrical conductivity. The room-temperature
hole carrier concentration increases from ∼9.1 × 1019 cm–3 for the sample with x = 0.01 to ∼1.7 × 1020, 1.9 × 1020, and ∼2.3 × 1020 cm–3 for the samples with x = 0.02, x = 0.03, and x = 0.035, respectively. The increase
in carrier concentration with dopant concentration indicates that
Na+ is incorporated into the PbS0.1Se0.35Te0.55 lattice. The room-temperature Hall mobility decreases
with increasing Na content, which may originate from the increased
carrier concentration and consequently increased carrier scattering
at dopant atoms and possibly nanoscale structural defects. The mobility
of the sample with x = 0.01 is ∼87 cm2 V–1 s–1 at room temperature,
which is reduced significantly for the sample with x = 0.02 (62 cm2 V–1 s–1). However, at concentrations above x = 0.02, the
changes in carrier concentration and mobility are much smaller, which
are consistent with the relatively small change in the Hall coefficient
of the samples (Figure 2c).

Figure 2a,b shows
the electrical resistivity (ρ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) of Pb1–xNaxSe0.35S0.1Te0.55 (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.035) as a function
of temperature in the temperature range 300–823 K. Both ρ
and S increase with temperature, indicating a typical
behavior of degenerate semiconductors. The electrical resistivity
decreases with Na concentration from x = 0.01 to
0.02 (Figure 2a) because
of the increased carrier concentration (Figure 2c) and remains roughly the same at higher
dopant concentrations. This is in agreement with the results of Table 1 and Figure 2c, which show that the carrier
concentration of the samples remains roughly the same for doping levels
above x = 0.02. For the x = 0.01
sample, the Seebeck coefficient (Figure 2b) increases monotonically with temperature
from ∼42 μV K–1 at 300 K to ∼276
μV K–1 at 820 K. From 300 to 600 K, the Seebeck
coefficient increases almost linearly for the heavily Na-doped samples
(x > 0.01). However, at ∼600 K, a change
in
slope is observed, which we associate with the convergence of the
two valence bands. In the two valence band model, as the temperature
increases, the heavy valence band merges with the light valence band
and holes are transferred from the light band to the heavy band. As
the DOS in the heavy band is much higher than that of the light band,
a higher Seebeck coefficient is exhibited compared with that for the
light band alone (given the same carrier density).22,23,27 The contribution of the heavy band also
raises the Hall coefficient of PbTe alloys at temperatures higher
than 100 K (Figure 2c).31 Therefore, the Hall coefficient
of these samples should be measured at temperatures below 100 K to
determine the actual carrier concentration. Although 45% of PbTe in
these samples is replaced by PbSe and PbS, the temperature-dependent
Hall coefficient shows a behavior typical of PbTe alloys. Figure 2d shows that sodium
exhibits good dopant efficiency, allowing control of the Hall carrier
concentration up to a value of 3.5 × 1020 cm–3 at x = 0.02 for temperatures below 100 K. The measured
Hall carrier concentration [nH = 1/(e·RH)] is in good agreement
with the calculated carrier concentration up to x = 0.02, but deviates at higher values of x. This
indicates that the successful incorporation of Na atoms in the lattice
is limited to x < 0.02. Although no secondary
phases appear in the XRD patterns with increasing Na concentration,
suggesting that Na is entirely incorporated into the structure, excess
sodium (concentrations above the solubility limit) is shown to segregate
at grain boundaries and structural defects in lead chalcogenides.32 Moreover, excess Na can form low concentrations
of nanoscale precipitates, which cannot be detected by XRD.28 The Seebeck coefficient decreases with the addition
of Na in PbSe0.35S0.1Te0.55 over
the entire 300–820 K temperature range. The most significant
decrease is observed from x = 0.01 to x = 0.02, and then the variation is insignificant at higher x. This result is in agreement with the changes in carrier
concentration (Figure 2d). No samples show any sign of bipolar electrical conductivity.

The total thermal conductivity, κtot, for Pb1–xNaxSe0.35S0.1Te0.55 (x =
0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.035) is plotted as a function of temperature
in Figure 3a. The total
thermal conductivity decreases with temperature for all samples and
increases with dopant concentration (the total thermal conductivity
of the x = 0.035 sample is roughly equal to that
of the x = 0.03 sample). This is due to the significant
contribution of the electronic thermal conductivity in these compounds.
The thermal conductivity at 850 K for the x = 0.01,
0.02, and 0.03 samples reaches ∼0.9, 1.0, and 1.2 W m–1 K–1, respectively. The lattice thermal conductivity,
κL, was calculated by subtracting the electronic
contribution, κe, from the measured total thermal
conductivity such that κL = κtotal – κe, where the value of κe can be calculated by employing the Wiedemann–Franz relation,
κe = LσT,
where σ is the electrical conductivity, T is
the temperature, and L is the Lorenz number. An estimation
of the Lorenz number as a function of temperature is made by assuming
a parabolic band with acoustic phonon scattering through the equation33  where η is the reduced chemical potential
calculated from the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient using
the equation  with the Fermi integrals, Fj(η), defined as  where ε is the reduced carrier energy.

and 0.035) in the temperature range 300–850 K. (b) Comparison
of the lattice thermal conductivity of the x = 0.02
compound with that of the single-phase samples of Na-doped PbTe,34 Pb0.98Na0.02Se0.1Te0.9,23 and Pb0.98Na0.02Se0.1S0.05Te0.8524 and multiphase samples of Pb0.98Na0.02Se0.1S0.25Te0.6524 and Pb0.985Na0.015Se0.1S0.25Te0.65.25

A low lattice thermal conductivity
of between 1.0 and 1.3 W m–1 K–1 is obtained for all samples
at room temperature, with no obvious dependence on doping concentration.
This implies that the extra point defects created by the dopant do
not affect the degree of phonon scattering. The lattice thermal conductivity
at 850 K reaches approximately 0.6 W m–1 K–1 for all samples. The lattice thermal conductivity of the sample
with x = 0.02 is compared to that of single-phase
samples of Pb0.98Na0.02Te,34 Pb0.98Na0.02Se0.1Te0.9,23 Pb0.98Na0.02Se0.1S0.05Te0.85,24 and multiphase samples of Pb0.98Na0.02Se0.1S0.25Te0.6524 and Pb0.985Na0.015Se0.1S0.25Te0.6525 in Figure 3b. The current samples
exhibit lower κlatt than the single-phase Na-doped
compounds (PbTe)0.65(PbS)0.25(PbSe)0.124 and (PbTe)0.9(PbSe)0.1,23 as well as Na-doped PbTe
below 600 K,34 and κlatt of our samples is comparable to that of the multiphase nanostructured
compound Pb0.985Na0.015Se0.1S0.25Te0.6525 and the
single-phase compound Pb0.98Na0.02Se0.1S0.05Te0.85.24 The
microscopy analysis of single-phase polycrystalline Pb chalcogenides
(with similar composition to those in the current study) shows no
significant microstructural changes with slight compositional variations;35 thus, the significantly reduced κlatt in our single-phase compound can be attributed to enhanced
phonon scattering arising from randomly distributed Se and S solute
atoms in the matrix.

The TE figures of merit of all the samples
are compared with p-type
PbTe,34 PbSe,13 and PbS36 as a function of temperature
in Figure 4. The maximum
figure of merit of ∼1.5 is obtained at 823 K for the heavily
doped samples. All four compounds show figures of merit of >1 over
a wide temperature range above 675 K. By comparison, the figure of
merit reaches 1 only above 750 K for p-type PbSe13 and 800 K for p-type PbS.36 The
higher figure of merit obtained at lower temperatures can improve
the power generation efficiency of TE devices.

300–823 K, compared with maximum reported zT values for binary p-type PbSe,13 p-type

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized p-type single-phase
quaternary
lead chalcogenide compounds in which 45% of the tellurium is substituted
by more abundant elements, such as sulfur and selenium, and we have
investigated the effect of various Na-dopant concentrations on the
TE performance of this compound. The quaternary, single-phase Na-doped
compound (PbTe)0.55(PbS)0.1(PbSe)0.35 exhibits a zT of approximately 1.5 at 823 K and
is above 1.0 over a wide temperature range above 675 K. The high TE
performance is attributed largely to a low lattice thermal conductivity
that is of comparable magnitude to multiphase nanostructured lead
chalcogenides. This is due to the phonon scattering that takes place
at point defects associated with solute atoms with a large atomic
mass contrast.

Experimental Section
Sample Fabrication
Synthesis
A polycrystalline ingot of PbS was synthesized
by mixing a stoichiometric ratio of high purity Pb granules (99.999%,
Alfa Aesar) and S powder (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) in a vacuum-sealed
quartz ampoule, followed by reacting them at 1373 K to produce a high-purity
PbS starting material. Polycrystalline ingots of Pb1–xNaxSe0.35S0.1Te0.55 with x = 0.01, 0.02,
0.03, and 0.035 were prepared by mixing appropriate quantities of
the PbS precursor, Pb, Se granules (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), Te powder
(99.999%, Alfa Aesar), and crushed Na chunks (99%, Aldrich) as the
dopant, with a total mass of 10 g for each sample, loaded into carbon-coated
quartz ampoules. The ampoules were sealed under vacuum, then heated
to 1373 K, and held at the same temperature for 10 h. The ampoules
were then quenched in cold water and annealed at 823 K for 72 h.

Sintering
The ingots obtained from the synthesis procedure
mentioned above were ground by hand to a fine powder using an agate
mortar and pestle and sintered into 12 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness
disk-shaped pellets using spark plasma sintering (SPS) under vacuum
at 793 K and an axial pressure of 40 MPa for 30 min.

Transport
Property Measurements
Seebeck Coefficient and Resistivity Measurements
The
electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) were simultaneously measured using a Linseis LSR-3 instrument.
Measurements were performed under helium atmosphere from room temperature
to 823 K. The disk-shaped samples from SPS were cut and polished into
parallelepiped shapes for these measurements.

Thermal Conductivity
Measurements
The total thermal
conductivity (κ) was calculated using the formula κ =
ρDCp. The laser flash diffusivity
method (Linseis LFA 1000) was used to measure the thermal diffusivity, D, in the temperature range 300–850 K. The density
(ρ) of the sintered samples was calculated by measuring the
mass and dimensions. All samples had measured densities higher than
95% of their theoretical values. The specific heat capacity (Cp) was calculated using the equation Cp (kB per atom)
= (3.07 + 4.7 × 10–4(T/K – 300)).37

Hall Measurements
Hall coefficients (RH) were measured
using a quantum design physical property
measurement system under magnetic fields of up to ±2 T in the
range 5–400 K.

Materials Characterization
X-ray Diffraction
PXRD was carried out using a GBC
Scientific X-ray diffractometer operating with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.542 Å, 40 kV, 25 mA) at room temperature. The XRD
patterns were fitted by the Rietveld method using the GSAS software
suite.38
