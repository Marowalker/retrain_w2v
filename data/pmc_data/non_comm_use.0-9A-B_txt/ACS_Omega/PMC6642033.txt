Identifying and reducing the dominant
recombination processes in
perovskite solar cells is one of the major challenges for further
device optimization. Here, we show that introducing a thin interlayer
of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) between the perovskite film and the
hole transport layer reduces nonradiative recombination. Employing
such a PVP interlayer, we reach an open-circuit voltage of 1.20 V
for the best devices and a stabilized efficiency of 20.7%. The beneficial
effect of the PVP interlayer is proven by statistical analysis of
various samples, many of those showing an open-circuit voltage larger
than 1.17 V, and a 30 mV increase in average compared to unmodified
samples. The reduced nonradiative recombination is proven by enhanced
photo- and electroluminescence yields.

Introduction
The past several years
have seen the emergence of organic–inorganic
metal-halide perovskite solar cells.1−3 These perovskites are
described by the chemical formula ABX3, where A = cesium
(Cs), methylammonium (MA), or formamidinium (FA); B = Pb or Sn; and
X = Cl, Br, or I. Starting from MAPbI3,1 A and X sites have been partially substituted to improve
solar cell performance,4−7 where extensive optimization leads to an outstanding solar-to-electric
power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 22%.8 An open-circuit voltage (Voc) larger than 1.2 V9,10 has been reached, which is a
remarkable value for a material with a band gap of approximately 1.6
eV. This exceptional performance has been attributed to the high defect
tolerance11 and low densities of deep traps12 in the material along with high light absorption
over the visible spectrum including a sharp absorption onset and charge
carrier diffusion lengths in the micrometer range.13−16

While photocurrents in
efficient MAxFA1–xPb(IyBr1–y)3 solar
cells are already close to their practical limits, there is still
room for improvement of Voc and fill factor.
With a theoretical maximum Voc between
1.32 and 1.36 V (dependent on the band gap and for the so far best
devices),17 the experimentally achieved Voc is still strongly limited by nonradiative
recombination. Whereas perovskite devices of the first generation
suffered from recombination introduced by nonhomogenous rough films,
the second generation devices are suspected to be affected by defects
in the perovskite layer itself,16 where
the role of grain boundaries is controversially discussed.10,18,19 Furthermore, interfaces to the
contact layers are receiving considerable attention because of the
fact that employing nonselective contacts results in low Voc.17,20 Zarazua et al. have shown that
recombination at the TiO2 contact dominates the charge
carrier lifetime and therefore Voc.21 Studying SnO2-based devices, Correa-Baena
et al. found that recombination at the hole transport layer (HTL)
tetrakis(N,N-di- p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene
(spiro-OMeTAD) affects Voc, where a reduction
of the dopant concentration can enhance Voc toward values larger than 1.2 V.10

The work presented here is motivated by that study. A thin layer
of the wide band gap polymer poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) is introduced
as an interlayer between the perovskite and the spiro-OMeTAD, and
its effect as a selective layer is investigated. Similar concepts
of interface modification [e.g., by phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
ester (PCBM) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)] have been applied
to the interface with the electron transport layer22−24 and the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) HTL in inverted devices.25−27 Improvements of performance have been ascribed to low leakage currents
and reduced recombination at the interfaces. Additionally, compositional
changes of mixed perovskite films are reported to reduce surface recombination
and enhance Voc and PCE.28 Passivation of surface states employing the Lewis bases
thiophene and pyridine has been reported to decrease nonradiative
recombination and to facilitate a Voc of
1.05 V already in the early days of MAPbI3 solar cell research.29

Recently, PVP was employed on top of a
noncompact perovskite layer
to enhance Voc toward 1.05 V.30 Very recently, PVP was added to the methylammonium
iodide solution during a two-step deposition method, where it is supposed
to act as a passivation agent in the perovskite film, which resulted
in a Voc up to 1.15 V in a planar architecture.31 Our work employs PVP for the first time as a
selective layer on top of a smooth perovskite film and already high-Voc reference devices, yielding reproducibly
higher Voc than nonmodified devices with
a maximum of 1.20 V and a stabilized PCE of 20.7%.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a depicts
the structure of PVP, and Figure 1b shows a schematic of a device composed of a fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) electrode, a 20–30 nm thin compact TiO2 layer, a ≈150 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer,
and a ≈500 nm perovskite layer of the nominal composition “Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3”.32 It is covered with a 200 nm HTL spiro-OMeTAD and an 80
nm gold electrode. The PVP is introduced as a thin interlayer on top
of the perovskite by spin-coating from a solution of 0.1 mg mL–1 in isopropanol (6000 rpm), prior to depositing the
HTL. The deposition conditions were obtained by an optimization study
yielding a suitable thickness. It was found that the subsequent deposition
of the HTL in chlorobenzene does not dissolve the PVP layer.

Figure 1 Materials and
device. (a) 3D structure of PVP and (b) schematic
of the perovskite solar cell. The PVP is placed between the perovskite
and the HTL.

Comparing devices with
and without PVP reveals that the Voc is
systematically higher when PVP is added.
The statistics of devices prepared in eight batches shows that both
average and extreme values are higher for PVP-modified devices (Figure 2a). However, because
of variations in the quality of the perovskite and the TiO2 layer, the spread of Voc is large. Therefore,
we added a comparison of the maximum Voc in each batch (Figure 2b), which clearly shows that PVP-modified devices show higher Voc. The spread of Voc and the sometimes more, sometimes less pronounced effect of PVP
indicate that slight changes in each component during fabrication
such as the electron-selective layer or the perovskite film affect
recombination and can limit performance in high-Voc devices. This is consistent with the different findings
on dominant recombination processes in the literature as mentioned
in the introduction of this article.

for one of the best performing devices under each condition in this
study measured in reverse and forward sweep (10 mV s–1). All measurements were obtained under simulated sun light and using

area).

Figure 2c,d shows
current–voltage (JV) curves of one of the
best performing devices with and without PVP that have been fabricated
for this study. Table 1 displays the respective characteristic parameters. The beneficial
effect of an increased Voc from 1.11 to
1.15 V is also visible in the PCE, which is increased from 18.6 to
20.7%, measured as a stabilized maximum power output during maximum
power point (MPP) tracking. The measured short-circuit current density
is close to the value expected from the incident-photon-to-current-efficiency
(IPCE) shown in Figure S1.

a PCE is power conversion

To exclude that
the improvement in Voc is caused just
by the solvent (isopropanol) treatment, we coated
the perovskite with pure isopropanol. In that case, Voc remains unmodified as shown by the data in Figure S2. Thus, we conclude that the PVP layer
itself is beneficial for Voc by reducing
nonradiative recombination.

To investigate whether the effect
of PVP is an enhancement of contact
selectivity or a chemical passivation of the perovskite surface, we
measure photoluminescence (PL) on unmodified and modified perovskite
films on glass. We also use PMMA-covered films as a further reference. Figure 3a shows the respective
PL spectra. Keeping the geometry and parameters of the measurement
setup unmodified, we are able to compare absolute spectra. We observe
that the PL intensity of the perovskite film covered with PMMA is
slightly higher than that of the control (W/O PVP) perovskite film.
However, employing PVP on top of the perovskite film, the PL intensity
is strongly increased. Interestingly, this effect is only observed
when the sample is additionally covered by PMMA which might act as
a moisture barrier. The considerably higher PL emission observed only
for PVP treatment indicates that the enhancement of Voc is mainly due to a passivation of surface defects on
the perovskite in accordance to the hypothesis raised for pyridine
treatment.29 The slightly higher PL for
a thicker PVP layer can be explained by a better surface coverage.
However, this finding does not reveal the microscopic origin of the
passivation effect, which could be not only due to a reduction of
surface defects but also due to, for example, a reduction of the Huang–Rhys
factor, describing the electron–phonon coupling.33,34 Furthermore, it is not completely excluded that the PVP interlayer
in the solar cell might also be beneficial in reducing interface recombination
at the spiro-OMeTAD (electrons in the perovskite with holes in the
spiro-OMeTAD) by acting as a tunneling layer and reducing the wave
function overlap.

Figure 3 Characterization of recombination. (a) PL spectra of perovskite
layers on glass with different top layer(s), (b) external EL yield
as a function of injection current detected during a voltage loop
with a sweep rate of 20 mV s–1, (c) Voc as a function of illumination intensity obtained from
an intensity sweep from low to high intensity and back (settling time
5 s), and (d) differential ideality factor obtained from an analysis
of Voc vs light intensity for several
devices. The error bars show that determining the differential ideality
factor in these devices leads to errors in the range of ±0.2.

To investigate whether enhanced
luminescence efficiency can be
observed in the solar cell devices as well, we performed electroluminescence
(EL) measurements on representative high-Voc devices. As shown in Figure 3b, we detect an increased external EL efficiency by approximately
1 order of magnitude, approaching 0.05 and 0.7%, respectively, at
an injection current equaling the short-circuit current under sunlight.
These values imply a reduction of the nonradiative Voc loss by ≈60 mV, which is consistent with the Voc measured on these devices without an aperture
(1.13 and 1.19 V) and the overall trend.

Furthermore, we investigate Voc as
a function of the illumination intensity following the procedure described
in ref (35). We observe
that the differences in Voc are maintained
independent of illumination intensity (Figure 3c). The slope remains unmodified, and deduced
ideality factors of 1.5–1.6 (at high light intensities) are
comparable (Figure 3d); the increased values for lower intensity are predominantly due
to shunts. This finding indicates that the PVP treatment does not
dramatically change the recombination mechanism but the nonradiative
recombination rate independent of charge carrier density and voltage.
The often proposed idea of trap filling with higher charge carrier
densities cannot be observed here; neither an effect of enhanced surface
recombination for higher light intensities. The latter would result
in a reduction of the ideality factor with light intensity as observed
in organic solar cells with low built-in potential.36 In the case here, the PVP passivates defects on the perovskite
surface, possibly including surfaces (of grains) that penetrate into
the interior of the film.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
shown that PVP deposited between the perovskite
and the HTL reduces nonradiative recombination. The Voc has been increased up to 1.20 V, and a stabilized efficiency
of 20.7% has been reached. Using PL and EL measurements and analyzing
the diode ideality factor, we have found that PVP mainly passivates
defect states on the perovskite surface and possibly at the interface
with the HTL, which otherwise act as recombination centers. Our study
indicates that both interfaces and bulk of the perovskite have to
be further optimized to reduce nonradiative recombination to reach
reproducibly a Voc larger than 1.2 V.

Experimental
Section
Fabrication of Films for Spectroscopy
The samples were
fabricated on cleaned, plasma-etched glass substrates, where the perovskite
precursor solution was spin-coated onto the glass directly after UV–ozone
treatment. Subsequent to the deposition of the perovskite layer, the
substrates were annealed for 1 h at 100 °C. The films were then
spin-coated with PVP (Aldrich) solution (0.1 mg mL–1 in isopropanol) for 30 s at 6000 rpm with a ramp of 2000 rpm s–1, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 20 min,
and/or 10 mg mL–1 solution of PMMA (Aldrich) spin-coated
for 20 s at 1000 rpm with a ramp of 500 rpm s–1.
For thicker PVP films, the parameters were changed to 30 s and 1000
rpm with a ramp of 500 rpm s–1.

Solar Cell
Fabrication and Electron-Selective Layer Preparation
FTO
substrates (10 Ω sq–1, Nippon Sheet
Glass) were etched with zinc powder and HCl (4 M) to form the electrode
pattern. Glass sheets were ultrasonically cleaned by a sequential
(15 min), 2% Hellmanex water solution, deionized water, ethanol, and
acetone. Substrates were further cleaned with UV–ozone treatment
for 15 min. A 20–30 nm TiO2 compact layer was then
deposited on the clean preheated FTO substrates by spray pyrolysis
from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)
in anhydrous ethanol, using oxygen as the carrier gas on a hot plate
set to 450 °C, followed by annealing at 450 °C, for 30 min
in air. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on compact
TiO2/FTO substrates via spin-coating of 30 nm particle
size paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) diluted in ethanol (150 mg mL–1) at 4000 rpm for 20 s with a ramp of 2000 rpm s–1 to achieve a ∼150 nm layer thickness. The substrates were
immediately dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again
at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow.

Li doping of mesoporous
TiO2 was accomplished by spin-coating a 0.1 M solution
of bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile
at 3000 rpm with a ramp of 1000 rpm s–1 for 10 s
and Li+-treated substrates followed by another sintering
step at 450 °C for 30 min.37 After
cooling down to 150 °C, the substrates were immediately transferred
to an argon atmosphere glovebox for depositing the perovskite films.

Perovskite Precursor Solution and Film Preparation
The organic
monovalent cation salts were purchased from Dyesol; the
lead compound was purchased from TCI; and CsI was purchased from abcr
GmbH. The “Cs containing-mixed perovskite” precursor
solution was prepared by dissolving FAI (1 M), CsI (0.05 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M), and PbBr2 (0.22 M) in anhydrous
dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide 4:1 (v/v), as reported earlier
by us.32 The respective perovskite solution
was spin-coated in a two-step procedure at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10
and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, 200 μL of chlorobenzene
was poured on the spinning substrate 5 s before the end of the procedure.
The substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h on a hot
plate in the argon-filled glovebox.

Passivation Layer, Hole
Transporting Layer, and Top Electrode
After the perovskite
annealing, the substrates were cooled down
for a few minutes, and PVP (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (0.1 mg mL–1 in isopropanol) was spin-coated at 6000 rpm with
a ramp of 2000 rpm s–1 for 30 s, and the substrates
were then annealed at 70 °C for 20 min. After the PVP annealing,
the substrates were cooled down for a few minutes, and a spiro-OMeTAD
(Merck) solution (70 mM in chlorobenzene) was spin-casted at 4000
rpm for 20 s. Spiro-OMeTAD was doped with Li-TFSI (Sigma-Aldrich),
tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)
tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide) (FK209, Dyenamo), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich). The molar ratio
of additives for spiro-OMeTAD was 0.5, 0.03, and 3.3 for Li-TFSI,
FK209, and TBP, respectively. Finally, the 80 nm gold top electrode
was thermally evaporated under high vacuum. The active area was 0.25
cm2.

Perovskite Solar Cell Characterization
Solar cells
were measured using a 450 W xenon light source (Oriel). The spectral
mismatch between AM1.5G and the simulated illumination was reduced
by using a Schott K113 Tempax filter (Präzisions Glas &
Optik GmbH). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode
equipped with an infrared cutoff filter (KG3, Schott), and it was
recorded during each measurement. Current–voltage characteristics
of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while
measuring the current response with a digital source meter (Keithley
2400). The voltage scan rate was 10 mV s–1, and
no device preconditioning, such as prolonged light soaking or forward
voltage bias, was applied before starting the measurement. The starting
voltage was determined as the potential at which the cells furnish
1 mA in forward bias; no equilibration time was used. The cells were
masked with a black metal mask, limiting the active area to 0.16 cm2 and reducing the influence of the scattered light.

Steady-state PL was measured using a Fluorolog, HORIBA Jobin Yvon,
FL-1065. A white tungsten lamp was used as the light source. A monochromator
was placed between the sample and the light source as well as between
the sample and the detector. An excitation wavelength of 450 nm was
used for all the samples. The emission spectrum was measured from
10 nm higher than the emission spectrum to 850 nm in steps of one
nm. An integration time of 1 s was used for each wavelength. The excitation
source and the detector were placed at 90° with respect to each
other. The sample was oriented 60° with respect to the excitation
source to decrease interference from reflected light.

Open-circuit
voltage as a function of illumination intensity was
measured using white LEDs. The devices were left unmasked at room
temperature and under constant nitrogen flow to prevent degradation
during operation. The data were analyzed as described in ref (35).

EL yield was measured
by applying a potential sweep to the device
and by recording the emitted photon flux with a calibrated, large
area (1 cm2) Si photodiode (Hamamatsu S1227-1010BQ) placed
directly on top of the sample. The driving voltage was applied using
a Bio-Logic SP300 potentiostat, which was also used to measure the
short-circuit current of the detector at a second channel.

The
IPCE spectra were measured with a system operating in the dc
mode and a 300 W Xe lamp as the light source combined with a monochromator
(Arkeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research s.r.l.). No bias light was applied.
