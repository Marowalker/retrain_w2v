Introduction
Indole
nuclei are the foundation for many well-known biologically
active molecules and exhibiting various pharmacological properties.1,2 Indolones are also valuable frameworks in medicinal chemistry and
material chemistry.3 Because both indoles
and indolones are relevant core structures for medicines, a fusion
of two frameworks could theoretically result in a range of biologically
active compounds. Therefore, developing a strategy to assemble two
biologically and medicinally interesting substructures into one skeletal
structure is one of the interesting and important topics in organic
synthetic chemistry. Transition-metal-catalyzed syntheses of indole–indolone
scaffolds have been developed in recent years.4 For example, Pd-catalyzed or Cu-catalyzed intramolecular annulation
of indole-N-arylated aldoximes (Scheme 1, route a) or N-(2-cyanophenyl)indoles (route b) to afford indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-imines has been reported.4a,4b Recently,
Rao and co-workers reported an annulation reaction of N-(2-formylaryl)indoles to give indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-ones
via silver-catalyzed direct oxidative coupling between aldehyde C–H
and sp2 C–H bonds (route c).4c Larock and Ramtohul et al. have developed fluoride and
inorganic base-mediated synthesis of indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-ones through the reaction of methyl indole-2-carboxylates
with arynes (route d).4d,4e Although significant progresses
have been made to date, a new method for the synthesis of diverse
indole–indolone scaffolds under metal-free conditions is still
highly desirable, particularly in the drug scanning process. Herein,
we report the methyl triflate (MeOTf)-induced annulation of N-(2-cyanoaryl)indoles to afford the indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-imines and the corresponding indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-ones under metal-free conditions.

Strategy Leading to Indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-imines
or Indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-ones
Results and Discussion
Learning from our previous studies
in the area of triflate-induced
annulation,5,6 we initially explored the reaction of 2-(3-methyl-1H-indol-1-yl)benzonitrile 1a and MeOTf 2a with the ratio of 1:1.5 in dichloroethane (DCE) under different
temperatures for 12 h (Table 1, entries 1–3), and 90 °C was found to be the
optimal temperature for this reaction with the NMR yield up to 75%
(entry 2). Then, different solvents were screened such as dichloromethane
(CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), tetrachloromethane
(CCl4), and toluene (entries 4–7). DCE was found
to be a superior solvent for this reaction (entry 2). Furthermore,
the effects of the reaction time were also examined (entry 2 and entries 8–9),
the best time for approving yield was 24 h (entry 9). When the ratio
of two components was converted to 1:1 and 1:2, the yield of 3a was 79 and 85% (entries 10–11), respectively. We
also tried the ratio of 1a and 2a in 1:1.2
and to our delight, 99% yield of 3a was also obtained.
On the basis of the above results, the optimal conditions are shown
in entry 12.

a Reaction conditions: 2-(3-methyl-1H-indol-1-yl)benzonitrile 1a (0.5 mmol), MeOTf 2a (0.75 mmol, 1.5 equiv)
in 0.5 mL solvent under air ambience.

mmol,

f MeOTf 2a (0.6 mmol,
1.2 equiv).

With the optimized
reaction conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 12), we probed the substrate
scope and the representative results are summarized in Scheme 2. Suitable N-(2-cyanoaryl)indole substrates 1 were prepared by the
coupling reaction of commercially available indole derivatives and
2-bromobenzonitrile derivatives.7 Generally,
the N-(2-cyanophenyl)-indoles containing electron-rich
or electron-deficient substituents could proceed smoothly to afford
indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-imines in high yields. For
example, N-(2-cyanophenyl)-indoles containing electron-donating
groups such as Me, OMe, NMe2 on the phenyl ring displayed
higher reactivity to afford the corresponding products in excellent
yields. Notably, when 2-(5-(dimethylamino)-1H-indol-1-yl)benzonitrile 2g was employed under the same reaction conditions and N,N,N-trimethyl-10-(methylimino)-10H-indolo[1,2-a]indol-2-aminium trifluoromethanesulfonate 3g was obtained in 75% yield. When 2.2 equiv of MeOTf were
added, 3g was obtained quantitatively. The N-(2-cyanophenyl)-indoles containing electron-withdrawing groups such
as chlorine and fluorine also displayed higher reactivity to afford
the corresponding products in excellent yields (3h–3l). To further expand the substrate scope, the benzonitrile units
bearing either electron-donating groups such as methyl or electron-withdrawing
groups such as chlorine and fluorine were tested, and all of them
readily produce the desired products (3m–3p) in
quantitative yields, respectively. The stereochemistries of 3b and 3m were determined by 2-D NMR. The nuclear
Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra revealed that the methyl group
and the original indolyl group were in cis-fashion (see Figures S2
and S3 in the Supporting Information).
In addition, 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzonitrile 1q, 2-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)benzonitrile 1r, and 2-(3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzonitrile 1s could be used as well to produce the corresponding compounds 3q, 3r, and 3s in good yields, respectively.
It is noteworthy that 2-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-1-yl)benzonitrile 1t was used in this reaction
with 2.2 equiv of MeOTf and 1-methyl-6-(methylimino)-6H-pyrido[3′,2′:4,5]pyrrolo[1,2-a]indol-1-ium
trifluoromethanesulfonate 3t was obtained in 96% yield.
Notably, when 2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-1-yl)benzonitrile
was employed in this reaction, no product was obtained. The starting
material remains.

Scheme 2 Scope of Cyclization of (2-Cyanoaryl)indoles
Reaction conditions: N-(2-cyanoaryl)indoles 1 (0.5 mmol), MeOTf 2a (0.6 mmol, 1.2 equiv)
in 0.5 mL of DCE, 90 °C under
air ambience, 24 h, isolated yield. bMeOTf 2a (1.1 mmol, 2.2 equiv).

In order to verify
the applicability of the current method, the
reaction was amplified to 10 mmol scale with the formation of indolo[1,2-a]indole 3f in 96% yield (2.38 g) (eq 1). 1  

We also performed the reactions with hydrolysis to convert
the
imine into keto functionality using hydrochloric acid aqueous solution
(6 M) at 90 °C for 12 h. The representative results are shown
in Scheme 3. The indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-ones 4 were obtained in good to
excellent yields. To our delight, the crystals of 4i, 4t, and 4u were suitable for single crystal analysis,
and their structures were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction
analysis.8 The structures of the compounds
were further confirmed in the formation of indole–indolone
scaffolds.

Scheme 3 Formation of (2-Cyanoaryl)indoles Subsequent Hydrolysis
Reaction conditions: (1) N-(2-cyanoaryl)indoles 1 (0.5 mmol), MeOTf 2a (0.6 mmol, 1.2 equiv)
in 0.5 mL of DCE under air ambience;
(2) HCl (6 M, 5 mL), isolated yield. bMeOTf 2a (1.1 mmol, 2.2 equiv).

On the basis of the
above results and related precedents,5,9 a plausible
mechanism is proposed as follows (Scheme 4): first, methylation of the N-(2-cyanoaryl)indole by MeOTf affords carbenium ion A or its resonance B. Then, intramolecular Friedel–Crafts
reaction of B with the subsequent deprotonation of intermediate C affords indole–indolone imine 3, which
undergoes hydrolysis with HCl aqueous solution to form indole–indolone
scaffold 4.

Scheme 4 Plausible Mechanism of the Reaction
Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed a MeOTf-induced intramolecular cyclization
of N-(2-cyanoaryl)indoles for the synthesis of indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-imines and the corresponding indolo[1,2-a]indol-10-ones. This annulation represents a general entry
for the construction of indole–indolone scaffolds in high yield
under metal-free condition.

Experimental Section
General Information
All the reactions were carried
out in air ambience. All materials were obtained from commercial sources
and used as received. DCE and toluene were freshly distilled, whereas
CH2Cl2, EtOAc, MeOH, and Et3N were
dried by an activated 4 Å molecular sieve. Column chromatography
was performed on a silica column (particle size 300 mesh). 1H NMR and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded
on 400 or 600 MHz at ambient temperature with CDCl3 or
CD3OD as the solvent. Chemical shifts (δ) were given
in ppm, in reference to the residual proton resonance of CDCl3 (7.26) or CD3OD (3.31), to the carbon resonance
of CDCl3 (77.16) or CD3OD (49.0). Coupling constants
(J) were given in Hertz (Hz). The terms m, q, t,
d, s referred to multiplet, quartet, triplet, doublet, singlet. High-resolution
mass spectra were recorded on electrospray mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF).
