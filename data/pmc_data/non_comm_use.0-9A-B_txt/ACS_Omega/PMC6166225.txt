2-Azaadamantan-6-one
and its Boc and ethylene ketal derivatives
were synthesized from 9-oxo endo-bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-3-carboxylic
acid. Similarly, the Cbz, Boc, and ethylene ketal derivatives of 2-azaadamantan-4-one
were synthesized from endo-bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-3-carboxylic
acid. Key steps were Curtius rearrangements to form benzyl carbamates,
followed by spontaneous intramolecular attack of the carbamate nitrogen
on transient bromonium ion or epoxide intermediates to effect ring
closure to azaadamantane intermediates. The reaction sequence leading
to 2-azaadamantan-6-one is consistent with the formation of a transient
tetracyclic keto aziridine intermediate.

Introduction
Aza and polyazaadamantanes
continue to play important roles in
organic and medicinal chemistry.1−13 Among the most useful members of the azaadamantane family are the
azaadamantanones 1–4 (Figure 1). 1-Azaadamantane-4-one (2),
the first azaadamantanone isomer to be described,14 was synthesized from amino ketal 5 in a double
intramolecular Mannich reaction15,16 (Scheme 1) and has figured prominently in diastereofacial
selection studies.17,18 More recently, the highly pyramidalized
reactive lactam 1-azaadamantan-2-one (1) was obtained
by the pyrolysis of N-Boc amino acid 6.19 Compound 7, the benzamide
derivative of 2-azaadamantan-4-one (3), the third isomer
of this family, was synthesized from unsaturated bicyclic carboxylic
acid 8 in seven steps in 31% overall yield.20 Key steps in this synthesis were a Curtius rearrangement,
leading to 9, followed by epoxidation and spontaneous
intramolecular attack of the amide nitrogen on the transient epoxide
intermediate to form the alcohol precursor of 7. As described
in a 2018 patent,21 compound 10, the N-benzyl derivative of 2-azaadamantan-6-one
(4) and fourth isomer of this family, was synthesized
from bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7,9-trione mono ethylene ketal (11)22 in four steps in 15% overall
yield. The key step in this synthesis was a reductive amination to
form azaadamantane 12. In this work,21 compounds were characterized only by low-resolution mass
spectrometry data.

(2), 2-azaadamantan-4-one (3), and 2-azaadamantan-6-one
(4).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1, 2, the Benzamide (7) Derivative
of 3, and the N-Benzyl (10) Derivative of 4
We envisioned that a similar reaction sequence to that
executed
by Staas and Spurlock20 in the synthesis
of 7 (Scheme 1) with 9-oxo endo-bicyclo[3.3.1]non-6-ene-3-carboxylic
acid (13) (vide infra) rather than 8 could
provide an avenue to obtain 4. Such an approach was recently
exemplifed by Kozawa and Endo23 and Shibuya
et al.24 who converted 8 to
carbamate 14(24) via a Curtius
rearrangement, followed by bromine-mediated cyclization to 15 (Scheme 2). Hydrogenolysis
of 15 yielded the desired 2-azaadamantane 16. Although the presumed β-bromo azaadamantane reaction intermediate 17 was not isolated, the authors were able to characterize
its tetracyclic aziridine cyclization product 18 which
underwent hydrogenolysis to 16.23 More directly, Shibuya et al.24 converted 14 to 16 in one step by intramolecular hydroamination
with four equivalents of triflic acid.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 2-Azaadamantane
(16) by Two Different Reaction
Pathways
Results and Discussion
Accordingly, we prepared starting material 13 in three
steps from bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione25 in 55% overall yield according to a modified method of Stetter and
Dorsch.26 Conversion of 13 to carbamate 19 (83% yield) was readily achieved by
a Curtius rearrangement, followed by reaction with benzyl alcohol
using the reaction protocol described by Shibuya et al24 (Scheme 3). Several attempts using hydroamination reactions with triflic
acid20 or other conditions27,28 failed to effect ring closure of 19 to the desired
azaadamantane. However, exposure of 19 to either bromine
at 0 °C or N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) at room
temperature (rt) effected cyclization to bromo azaadamantane carbamate 20 in 97–99% yield. Treatment of 20 with
H2, Pd/C, and K2CO3 in MeOH (or EtOH)
effected a one-pot Cbz deprotection and debromination to afford the
desired 4, which due to its high water solubility was
converted to Boc derivative 21 in an overall yield of
77%. Deprotection of 21 with ethereal hydrogen chloride
afforded 4 as the hydrochloride salt in 94% yield (Scheme 4). In addition, 23, the ethylene ketal derivative of 4, was obtained
from 21 in a two-step sequence with an overall yield
of 77%.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 21, the Boc Derivative of 4
Scheme 4 Synthesis of 2-Azaadamantan-6-one
(4) and Its Ethylene
Ketal Derivative 23
Next, in an attempt to convert 20 to key
intermediate 21 in a one-pot reaction, we exposed 20 to H2, Pd/C, Boc2O, and Et3N in dioxane (Scheme 5). Unexpectedly,
this reaction formed 24, the transcarbamylation product,
not the desired 21. Product 24 was also
formed when using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent or K2CO3 as the base. As we had not observed 26 in the conversion of 20 to 4 via 21, we recognized that 24 afforded another opportunity
to synthesize 26. Thus, deprotection of 24 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) afforded 25 as the
trifluoroacetate salt in 92% yield. Treatment of 25 with
K2CO3 in MeOH effected cyclization to 26. Hydrogenation of the crude reaction product afforded 4. However, the instability of 26 precluded its
isolation, and we could only characterize it by extraction with CDCl3, followed by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
analysis.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Tetracyclic Keto Aziridine 26
The structure of 26 was strongly suggested by 10 signals
in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum including a downfield
signal at 212.8 ppm, three methylene carbons in the APT spectrum,
and a molecular formula of C9H11NO determined
by HRMS. This structural assignment was consistent with key COSY correlations,
which identified H-9 as the only methine hydrogen with vicinal coupling
to its hydrogen partners on the adjacent methine carbons C-3 and C-7.
Further, a 15N–1H heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiment
showed that 2-N is a tertiary amine by the chemical shift and absence
of a directly bonded hydrogen; these data also revealed two-bond correlations
between 2-N and the hydrogen atoms on methine carbons C-1 and C-9
and three-bond correlations between 2-N and the hydrogen atoms on
methylene carbons C-4, C-8, and C-10.

The debromination of both 16 and 20 in
MeOH and EtOH solvents during hydrogenolysis presumably occurs via
SN2 cyclization to form an aziridinium bromide intermediate,
which after formation of the free base undergoes further hydrogenolysis
opening the aziridine ring. Because loss of bromide was not observed
in aprotic dioxane and THF solvents, we modeled the intramolecular
SN2 reaction to better understand the effects of solvent
and the carbonyl substituent. Figure 2 shows the potential energy diagram for the intramolecular
conversion of 17 and 25 to their respective
aziridinium salts 18H+ and 26H+. Using the M06-2x functional of Zhao and Truhlar,29 transition-state structures were located and
used as inputs for intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. The
following results are of interest: (1) both the free energy of activation
and the free energy of the reaction are lower for 17 versus 25; (2) the less than ideal angle of SN2 attack
of 152.8° is the same for both nonketone and ketone azaadamantane
transition states; (3) base neutralization of 26H+ is more exergonic compared to that of 18H+ (modeled with sodium carbonate base); and (4) changing to
a less polar THF solvent increases both the free energy of activation
and endergonic value of the reaction.

Figure 2 Potential energy diagram for the intramolecular
conversion of 17 and 25 to their respective
aziridinium salts 18H+ and 26H+.

From these data, we surmise
that decrease in stability of the aziridinium
product by the presence of an electron-withdrawing ketone or a decrease
in solvent polarity makes aziridinium ion formation less favorable.
These results also imply that the initial basicity of the azaadamantane
is the key factor in the formation of the aziridine intermediate;
the more basic the azadamantane, the more favorable the SN2 cyclization. Isodesmic modeling of proton affinity differences
between 17 and 25 indicates that 17 is approximately four pKa units more
basic than 25 (Supporting Information). The substantial decrease in basicity afforded by a carbonyl group
three bonds from the aza group is consistent with the withdrawal of
electron density by both inductive and field effects.30

Encouraged by the successful conversion of 13 to 4, we then sought to use a similar approach
to convert 8 to 3 (Scheme 6). The starting material bicyclic carbamate 14 was obtained from 8 according to the method
of Shibuya
et al.24 Treatment of 14 with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA)
effected cyclization to hydroxy azaadamantane carbamate 27 in 81% yield; 27 was presumably formed as the anti
epimer20 assuming back-side attack of the
epoxide by the carbamate. Oxidation of 27 furnished 28, the Cbz derivative of 3 in 93% yield. Transcarbamylation
of 28 afforded the corresponding Boc derivative 29 in 98% yield. However, all attempts to synthesize 3 by hydrogenolysis of 28 or acid-promoted deprotection
of 29 failed. Nevertheless, we were able to convert 28 to 31, the ethylene ketal derivative of 3, in a three-step two-pot sequence with an overall yield
of 96%. Thus, 3, unlike 4, is stable only
when one of its two functional groups is in a protected form.

Scheme 6 Synthesis of the Cbz (28), Boc (29), and
Ethylene Ketal (31) Derivatives of 2-Azaadamantan-4-one
(3)
In summary, we synthesized 2-azaadamantan-6-one (4) and its Boc (21) and ethylene ketal (26) derivatives. We also describe syntheses of the Cbz (28), Boc (29), and ethylene ketal (31) derivatives
of 2-azaadamantan-4-one (3). We anticipate that these
azaadamantanes will be useful starting points for further exploration
because of the rich chemistry available for their ketone and secondary
aliphatic amine functional groups.

Experimental Section
General
Melting points are uncorrected. 1D 1H and 13C NMR spectra were generated with a 500 MHz spectrometer
using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as
solvents. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm)
and are relative to internal (CH3)4Si (0 ppm)
for 1H and CDCl3 (77.0 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (39.7 ppm) for 13C NMR. Electron
ionization gas chromatography–MS (EI GC–MS) data were
obtained using a quadrapole mass spectrometer with 30 m DB-5 type
columns and a He flow rate of 1 mL/min. We used a silica gel (sg)
particle size of 40–63 μm for all flash column chromatography.
Reported reaction temperatures are those of the oil bath.
