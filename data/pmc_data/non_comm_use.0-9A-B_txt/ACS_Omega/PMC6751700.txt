All-inorganic mixed-halide CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are excellent candidates for
green-emitting phosphors in wide color gamut displays; however, a
detailed investigation of their photoluminescence (PL) properties
based on the halide composition has been missing. In this work, we
report a fundamental investigation of the changes in the PL properties
of CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs. The PL color of the NCs, which were prepared
by a hot-injection method, changed from green to red with increasing
iodide composition (x). Almost ideal green emission
close to the chromaticity coordinates of the green vertex of the BT.2020
standard was achieved by appropriately substituting iodide ions for
bromide ions in monohalide CsPbBr3 NCs. However, the PL
peak width of the mix-halide NCs at x ∼ 0.5
was 0.127 eV, which was broader than the 0.105 eV peak width of the
monohalide CsPbBr3 NCs. This phenomenon should be due to
the compositional inhomogeneity among the individual CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs.
On the other hand, the PL quantum yield (PLQY) for the monohalide
CsPbBr3 NCs decreased from 70 to 25% as x increased to 0.5. This result may be attributed to lattice distortion
by the difference in the ionic radii of bromide and iodide. Improvements
in the compositional inhomogeneity and lattice distortion would enhance
the color purity of the green emission and the PLQY, respectively,
of the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs.

1 Introduction
Displays
using patterned red-green-blue emitters without color filters can
realize excellent color purity and a wider color reproduction range
with higher emission efficiencies compared to those exploiting a white
backlight passed through color filters.1,2 In the former
method, a blue light-emitting diode (LED) is used as a blue light
source, and green- and red-emitting phosphors are excited by the blue
light to obtain green and red colors, respectively. BT.2020, which
is a next-generation color standard for 4/8 K broadcasting, has a
significantly larger range in the green than the conventional color
system BT.709.3,4 To satisfy the BT.2020 standard,
green-emitting phosphors with extremely high color purities are required
for the green emitters in displays. Traditional lanthanide-doped green
phosphors show photoluminescence (PL) from Tb3+ through
4f–4f transitions5 and from Eu2+ and Ce3+ through 4f–5d transitions;6,7 however, these phosphors cannot realize the required color purity
because of their unnecessary PL peaks outside of the green region
and broad PL peak widths. CdSe quantum dots (QDs) are the most commonly
used nanophosphors that exhibit visible emission, including green
emission,8 although Cd is highly toxic;
therefore, other visible-emitting QDs such as CuInS2 and
InP have been identified as Cd-free alternative materials.9−11 Green-emitting InP QDs are one of the candidates for application
in wide color gamut displays; however, the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of their green PL peak is ∼50 nm, which is too broad
to satisfy the green range of the BT.2020 standard.11

In recent years, all-inorganic perovskite semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) of the form CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have
shown great development, triggered by a report from Protesescu et
al.12 The PL wavelength of these NCs can
be tuned in the visible region between 410 and 700 nm by changing
the halide composition, and smaller FWHMs of the PL peak with excellent
PL quantum yields (PLQYs) of 50–90% have been observed.13 Moreover, to obtain these high PLQYs, core/shell
structures, such as CdSe/ZnS QDs14 and
InP/ZnS QDs,15 were not needed. The outstanding
PL properties of CsPbX3 NCs have attracted much attention;16 therefore, numerous studies on their synthetic
methods,17−19 improvements in their stabilities,20−23 and optoelectronic applications,
such as in LEDs and photodetectors,24,25 have been
reported.

Green-emitting CsPbBr3 NCs have a great
potential to realize green emission for wide color gamut displays
that satisfy the BT.2020 standard because of their highly pure PL
color derived from a FWHM of ∼20 nm. However, optimization
of the PL wavelength by controlling their band gap through partially
substituting I– for Br– is required,
whereas the PL peak width broadens as the iodide composition increases.
The optical properties of perovskite CsPbBr3 NCs have been
studied by many groups, while a detailed characterization of mixed-halide
perovskite NCs of the forms CsPb(Cl1–xBrx)3 and CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 is insufficient yet. Notably, perovskite CsPb(Cl1–xIx)3 is hard
to form at temperatures lower than 625 K.26 We found works including characterization of the optical properties
of perovskite NCs of the forms CsPb(Cl1–xBrx)3 and CsPb(Br1–xIx)3;12,27−29 however, a detailed
discussion on the relationship between their comprehensive PL properties
and the halide composition is missing. To realize next-generation
displays using CsPb(Br1–xIx)3, investigations of the changes
in the PL peak width and PLQY as well as PL peak position are needed.

This work reports the halide composition-dependent PL properties
of green-emitting CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs focused on the promising
application of these materials in wide color gamut displays. We prepared
the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs by a hot-injection method (Scheme 1), which is the most frequently
performed synthetic method,12,30 and characterized their
elemental composition, crystal structure, morphology, and optical
properties to discuss the influence of the halide composition on the
PL properties, such as the peak position, FWHM, and PLQY.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structures and Morphologies
of Synthesized CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs
Elemental compositions
of the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 powder samples were determined by an
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrument, as shown in Table 1. Herein, the nominal and actual
molar ratios of I/(Br + I) were defined as xn and xa, respectively. The measured
compositional ratio of Cs/Pb/(Br + I) was 1:1:3, which corresponded
to the stoichiometric ratio of CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 for each of the
samples. The value of xa increased monotonically
with increasing xn, as plotted in Figure 1. We found a tendency
for xa to be smaller than xn, possibly due to the higher reactivity of Br– than that of I– (Table 1).

Figure 1 Relationship between the nominal and actual
molar ratios of I/(Br + I), i.e., xn and xa, respectively, for the powder samples of the
CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs.

The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the powder samples are shown in Figure 2. All peaks at xn < 0.8 were assigned to the cubic phase CsPb(Br1–xIx)3. Some orthorhombic phase CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 was also observed
when xn = 0.80 and 1.00 (see enlarged
XRD profiles in Figure S1). The orthorhombic
phase could be formed from the cubic phase during storage because
cubic CsPbI3 is unstable under ambient conditions.31 The most stable phase of CsPbI3 is
the orthorhombic phase, while its cubic phase is metastable at room
temperature.32 The peaks of the cubic phase
shifted toward lower angles with increasing iodine content. Lattice
spacings were calculated from the XRD peak of the (200) crystal plane
by using Bragg’s law 1  where λ is the X-ray wavelength, d200 is the (200) lattice spacing, and θ is the reflection angle.
As shown in Figure 3, the lattice spacing linearly increased with increasing actual I/(Br
+ I), following Vegard’s law. The ionic radii of Br– and I– in a 6-fold coordination site are 196 and
220 pm,33 respectively; therefore, the
increase in lattice spacing was caused by substituting I– for Br–.

Field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the
samples are shown in Figure 4. The observed particles were rectangular regardless of their
composition. The mean particle size was 9.7–12.0 nm (see the
corresponding size distributions in Figure S2). The particle size increased as the I/(Br + I) ratio increased,
as reported by previous studies.34

Figure 4 TEM images

Surface ligands of the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs with xn = 0, 0.5, and 1.0 were evaluated by Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (see Figure S3 and Table S1). There was no remarkable difference in their FT-IR
spectra. Specific absorption peaks attributed to carboxylate and ammonium
salts were observed, revealing surface modification by oleate and
oleylammonium.

2.2 Optical Properties
Figure 5 displays
toluene dispersions of the NCs under white light and 365 nm ultraviolet
(UV) light. Their color under white light changed with changing iodide
composition. The apparent color might be affected by the efficiency
of their PL as well as their light absorption. The PL color under
UV light changed from bluish-green to red with increasing iodide composition. Figure 6A shows the ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra of the NC dispersions. The absorption
edge red-shifted as the iodide composition increased. Figure S4 shows the Tauc plots calculated from
the absorption spectra by the following equation 2  where α
is the absorbance, h is the Planck constant, ν
is the frequency, k is a constant, and Eg is the band gap.35 The value
of n was 0.5 because cubic CsPbX3 is a
direct transition semiconductor. The determined band gap of the NCs
linearly decreased with increasing xa,
as shown by line (a) in Figure 7. This is explained by the change in the band gap of the NCs
as a result of the changing halide composition. According to the band
structure of cubic CsPbX3, a change in the band gap is
mainly caused by a shift of the valence band maximum, which is primarily
composed of the p-orbitals of the halides.36

Figure 7 Changes
in the (a) band gap (Eg) and (b) PL peak
energy with changing xa in CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NC dispersions.

The PL spectra of the
NC dispersions are compared in Figure 6B. The NCs exhibit efficient PL emission through direct
interband transitions.37 The PL peak position
is plotted as a function of xa, as shown
by line (b) in Figure 7. The PL peak energy decreased with increasing xa due to the decrease in the band gap. The chromaticity
coordinates converted from the PL spectra changed from (0.058, 0.656)
to (0.680, 0.258) by tuning the contents of Br and I, as shown in Figure 8. The chromaticity
coordinates (0.184, 0.763) at xn = 0.33
was closest to the coordinates (0.170, 0.797) of the green vertex
of the BT.2020 standard. To realize the ideal emission color at the
green vertex, a narrower PL peak is required to improve the green
color purity. As shown in Figure 9, the FWHM of the PL peak reached its maximum at xa = 0.48, while it decreased as the halide composition
became closer to containing only bromide or iodide. The increase in
the FWHM could be explained by the widening of the particle size distribution
and the compositional inhomogeneity of Br– and I– between the individual NCs. Swarnkar et al. synthesized
CsPbBr3 NCs that were 11 nm in size by the hot-injection
method and found that there was no significant difference between
the PL peak widths from their ensemble and single nanocrystals.38 In this work, the NCs prepared by the hot-injection
method included particles larger than 10 nm, from TEM observation
(see Figure S2), while the exciton Bohr
diameters of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are 7 and 12
nm,12 respectively. In a typical hot-injection
method for perovskite CsPbX3 NCs, most of the formed NCs
are >10 nm in size due to their rapid growth rate.39 The quantum size effect in the prepared NCs should not
be strong; therefore, the influence of the inhomogeneity of the particle
sizes on the FWHM of the PL peak should be negligible. The FWHM decreased
as the halide composition approached that of a monohalide bromide
or iodide, whereas broadening of the PL peak was observed as xa approached 0.5. This might be due to compositional
inhomogeneity between individual NCs. According to the elemental analysis
of randomly selected single NCs by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX), local I/(Br + I) compositions of 0.20 and 0.46 were detected
for NCs prepared at xn = 0.50 (see Figure S5 and Table S2). Thus, there was compositional
inhomogeneity between individual NCs, causing an increase in the PL
peak width. The increase in FWHM is possibly caused by the photoinduced
phase segregation, which is known for mixed-halide lead perovskites.40 However, obvious separation of the PL peak was
not observed in Figure 6B.

Figure 9 Changes in the FWHM of the PL peak with changing xa in the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs.

As shown in Figure 10, the absolute PLQY of the NCs reached the minimum value at xa = 0.47, while it increased as xa approached both 0 and 1. This result should be due to
lattice distortion induced by the difference between the ionic radii
of Br– and I–. The PLQY decreased
with the formation of lattice defects that caused nonradiative recombination;
therefore, relaxation of the distorted lattice would enhance the PLQY.
Influence of defects on PLQY is generally discussed by PL decay curves.
However, average PL lifetimes of the CsPb(Brx–1Ix)3 NCs calculated
from the PL decay curves increased from 4.6 to 43.9 ns with increasing xa (see Figure S6 and Table S3), as reported in previous works.41 Intrinsically, there is a large difference in PL lifetimes of CsPbBr3 NCs and CsPbI3 NCs. The behavior of PLQY in Figure 10 therefore could
not be related to the PL lifetimes.

Figure 10 Changes in the absolute PLQY with changing xa in the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs.

To improve the lattice distortion of ABX3 crystals
with a cubic perovskite structure, substitution of the A-site or B-site
cations with other cations of different sizes is effective. According
to the previous work by Hu et al.,42 perovskite
(FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17) was stabilized through lattice shrinkage by substituting Cs+ for the larger A-site cations; herein, FA and MA are formamidinium
{(NH2)2CH+} and methylammonium {CH3NH3+} cations, respectively. The tolerance
factor T, which is an indicator of the stability
of an ABX3 crystal with a cubic perovskite structure, can
be represented by the following equation 3  where RA, RB, and RX are radii of the A-, B-, and X-site ions,
for which the coordination numbers are twelve, six, and six, respectively.42 For CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, their T values were calculated to be 0.862 and
0.851, respectively, based on their ionic radii, which are 188 pm
for Cs+, 119 pm for Pb2+, 196 pm for Br–, and 220 pm for I–.33 The cubic perovskite structure is most stable at T = 1; therefore, the lattice distortion of CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 would improve with increasing T. This can
be achieved by substituting a larger monovalent cation for Cs+ or a smaller divalent cation for Pb2+ in CsPb(Br1–xIx)3. CH3NH3+ and (NH2)2CH+, for which the ionic radii are 217 and
253 pm, respectively, are candidates for the larger monovalent cations.43 However, organic–inorganic perovskite
materials are more readily degraded than all-inorganic perovskite
materials.44 All-inorganic perovskite NCs
are promising for long-term use, whereas substituting a larger inorganic
monovalent cation for Cs+ in the A-site is unfeasible.
Substitution of Pb2+ in the B-site with smaller inorganic
divalent cations is a good way to relax the lattice distortion and
improve the PLQY.

3 Conclusions
We prepared
CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 perovskite NCs by a hot-injection method and
investigated the relationship between the halide composition and their
optical properties. The band gap and PL peak energy of the NCs decreased
with increasing iodine content. The emission color changed from bluish-green
to red. The chromaticity coordinates (0.184, 0.763) at xa = 0.23 were closest to the coordinates (0.170, 0.797)
of the green vertex of the BT.2020 standard. Thus, it is useful to
substitute an appropriate amount of I– for Br– in CsPbBr3 NCs for their application as
the green emitter in wide color gamut displays. The FWHM of the mix-halide
NCs at xa ∼ 0.5 was 0.127 eV, which
was broader than the 0.105 eV FWHM of the monohalide CsPbBr3 NCs. This result should be due to the compositional inhomogeneity
among the individual NCs. On the other hand, the PLQY decreased from
∼70% for the monohalide CsPbBr3 NCs to 25% as xa approached 0.5. This result may be attributed
to the lattice distortion induced by the difference in the ionic radii
of Br– and I–. Homogenization
of the halide composition among the individual NCs and relaxation
of the lattice distortion would improve the green color and PLQY of
the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs, respectively. The appropriate mixed-halide
composition almost realized the ideal green emission satisfying the
BT.2020 standard, but increase in the iodide ratio may decrease the
stability of the CsPb(Br1–xIx)3 NCs. Improvement on the stability
would be required for practical applications.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Cs2CO3 (99.99%, Mitsuwa Pure Chemical), PbBr2 (99%, Mitsuwa
Pure Chemical), and PbI2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used
as received without further purification. Additionally, 1-octadecene
(ODE; >90.0%, Tokyo Chemical Industry), oleic acid (OA; >85.0%,
Tokyo Chemical Industry), oleyleamine (OAm; 80–90%, Acros Organics), tert-butyl alcohol (>99.0% Tokyo Chemical Industry),
methyl acetate (99.5%, Kanto Chemical), and toluene (99.5%, Kanto
Chemical) were dehydrated over molecular sieves (3A 1/8, Wako Pure
Chemical Industries) prior to use.

4.2 Preparation
of Cs-Oleate Precursor
Cs2CO3 (1.25
mmol), ODE (20.0 mL), and OA (1.3 mL) were mixed and degassed for
1 h at 120 °C and then purged with Ar gas. A Cs-oleate precursor
solution was obtained by heating the mixture to 150 °C. The resulting
solution was preheated at 100 °C before being injected into the
reaction flask.

4.3 Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X = Br and I) NCs
ODE (5.0 mL), 0.376 (1 – xn) mmol PbBr2, and 0.376xn mmol PbI2 (xn = 0, 0.30, 0.33, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00) were
loaded into a 4-neck flask and degassed for 1 h at 120 °C and
then purged with Ar gas. OA (1.0 mL) and OAm (1.0 mL) were injected
into the flask, and after completely dissolving the salt mixture,
the temperature was raised to 180 °C. The Cs-oleate precursor
solution (0.8 mL) was swiftly injected into the reaction flask and
then cooled in an ice water bath after 5 s. Crystallized nanoparticles
were precipitated by adding tert-butyl alcohol (25.0
mL). Alternatively, methyl acetate (25.0 mL) was used when x = 1.00. The NCs were collected by centrifugation at ∼11 000g (10 000 rpm using a rotor with a diameter of 10
cm) for 5 min and then redispersed in toluene. Subsequently, the NC
powder was prepared by drying the collected NCs under vacuum overnight.

4.4 Characterization
The elemental ratios of
the NC powders were measured using an XRF analyzer (ZSXmini II, Rigaku).
Powder XRD profiles were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Rint-2200,
Rigaku) with a Cu Kα radiation source and monochromator. The
NC morphologies were observed by field-emission TEM (Tecnai G2, FEI). The TEM samples were prepared by vacuum drying a drop
of a NC dispersion on carbon-reinforced collodion-coated copper grids
(COL-C10, Oken Shoji) overnight. The EDX was performed on the same
apparatus. FT-IR absorption spectra of the samples in KBr disks were
recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer (FT/IR-4200, JASCO). UV–vis
absorption spectra of the NC dispersions were measured using an optical
absorption spectrometer (V-570, JASCO). The PL spectra of the NC dispersions
were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-6500, JASCO).
Each spectral response was calibrated using an ethylene glycol solution
of rhodamine B (5.5 g L–1) and a standard light
source (ESC-333, JASCO). Absolute PLQYs were measured using a quantum
efficiency measurement system (QE-2000-311C, Otsuka Electronics).
The PL decay curves were recorded on a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer
(Quantaurus-Tau C11367, Hamamatsu Photonics). Herein, the PL decay
curves were fitted with the following biexponential function 4  where t is time, A1 and A2 are the amplitudes,
and τ1 and τ2 are the PL decay times.
The average PL lifetime <τ> was calculated using eq 5. 5
