In Pb–Zn ore flotation, unintentional
activation of sphalerite
often leads to difficult separation of Pb and Zn minerals, during
which grinding plays a key role in unintentional activation. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to evaluate the surface component changes
of two different mineral particles and to propose the interaction
between galena and sphalerite during mixed grinding using time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The results show that
after mixed grinding of the galena and sphalerite, the Pb content
on the sphalerite surface increased with the decrease of Zn and Fe
contents on the sphalerite surface. The lead ions from galena were
obviously absorbed onto the sphalerite surface, while the zinc and
iron ions from sphalerite were not obviously migrated to the galena
surface. Principal component analysis (PCA) of a dataset composed
of 206 positive ion peaks of galena and sphalerite indicates that
the surface components of galena and sphalerite migrated from either
side to different degrees. This study successfully identified an important
factor for unintentional activation of lead and zinc minerals during
flotation: homogenization of surface components of different minerals
during grinding.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Galena (PbS) and sphalerite (ZnS) are abundant in the earth and
usually exist together in the same deposit.1−3 Most lead–zinc
ores are processed by differential flotation, in which galena is recovered
first followed by sphalerite.4,5 The addition/presence
of lead ions (Pb2+) in ore pulp can directly promote the
sphalerite flotation.6−8 Lead ions were considered to be able to substitute
Zn in the sphalerite lattice to form PbS9 or to be adsorbed on the sphalerite surface in the form of Pb–O–Zn10 at near-neutral pH conditions. Liu et al.11 and Bai et al.12 confirmed
that zinc and lead ions can be released from sphalerite and galena
during grinding, respectively. Rao and Natarajan13 found that lead ions could be detected on the surface of
sphalerite after it contacted galena in deionized water. It is widely
believed that grinding has a significant effect on the flotation of
sulfide minerals.14−19 More active sites in newly generated surfaces during wet grinding
of sulfide minerals lead to alterations of the chemical properties
of mineral surfaces.20 Peng et al.21 suggested that the grinding environment played
a key role in flotation separation of galena and pyrite, and this
role was closely associated with the lead and iron species presented
on the mineral surfaces. Xia et al.22 showed
that the amount of copper ions adsorbed on the sphalerite surface
was related to the grinding environment, and the oxidation of cathode
mineral during grinding was an important factor in the flotation separation
of sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Various electrochemical models have
been proposed to explain the interactive influence between different
sulfide minerals during the grinding process.16,23−25 Because the solutions of sphalerite and galena have
different potentials, a direct contact of these minerals in aqueous
systems would initiate a galvanic effect.26

Researchers have reported the effect of component migration
between
different minerals on their flotation.27−29 Hart et al.27 applied the principal component analysis (PCA)-assisted
time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) on the concentrate
and tailing samples collected from the mineral processing plant; their
results indicated that the transfer of Cu and Ni between chalcocite
and heazelwoodite resulted in inadvertent activation of heazelwoodite
and depression of the chalcocite. Zanin et al.28 also applied ToF-SIMS to survey the surface chemistry of
molybdenite in the concentrate from the copper–molybdenum flotation
circuit; the results indicated higher concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mg,
and K on the surface of slow floating molybdenite minerals compared
to the fast floating grains. However, up to now, no systematic study
has been carried out on the component migration between different
minerals. In view of the fact that the grinding process is the initial
stage of intense mineral mixing, in this study, the migration of surface
chemical components of the mixed sample (galena and sphalerite) after
mixed grinding was investigated using the ToF-SIMS. Because of the
sampling depth of 1–3 nm and the ion imaging of sub-micron-resolution,
ToF-SIMS is particularly suitable for analyzing the chemical component.30−32

In the present work, a PCA model was also established based
on
the spectral data of ToF-SIMS to qualitatively analyze the variation
of the surface components of galena and sphalerite after grinding.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Imaging Analysis
Figure 1a shows a
digital photograph
of the sphalerite sample magnified 100 times, in which the green square
area was the analysis area of 500 μm × 500 μm. The
picture was taken with a pixel density of 256 × 256 and a horizontal
resolution of less than 5 μm. Figure 1b–e shows the ion images of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+ and the overlay of Zn+–Fe+ obtained from the analysis area. In
the ion images, bright color indicated the area of high intensity,
whereas dark color indicated the area of low ion intensity. The ion
intensity was positively correlated with the content of the elements
or molecules, and it was affected by the surface roughness of the
samples.33,34 Ion intensity was usually lower in areas
where the surfaces were concaved. The results in Figure 1 show that the Zn+ and Fe+ distributions on the sphalerite surface were
similar, with a small amount of unevenly distributed Pb+. Fe+ is generally released from the lattice of sphalerite,35 but the Pb+ present may be released
from galena associated with sphalerite. Both Zn+ or Fe+ distribution can be used to identify sphalerite particles.

photograph of the sphalerite sample magnified 100 times;
(b–e) images of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+ and the overlay of Zn+–Fe+,
respectively.

Figure 2 shows the
ion images of the galena surface. Figure 2 shows that compared with the sphalerite
crystal in Figure 1, the signal intensity of Pb+ on the galena surface was
obviously stronger, while that of Fe+ and Zn+ were obviously weaker. In fact, there was almost no signal of Zn+. Pb+ distribution can thus be used to identify
galena particles in the samples.

(b–d) images of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+, respectively.

Figure 3 shows
the
ion images of the mixed samples after separate grinding of galena
and sphalerite. Partial galena and sphalerite particles can be distinguished
by observing Figure 3a, in which some silver-gray and reflective particles are galena,
while some light brown particles are sphalerite. From the ion images
of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+, it was observed
that Zn+ and Fe+ had similar distributions,
while the distribution of the Pb+ showed a marked difference
from that of Zn+ and Fe+. In other words, the
intensity of Fe+ was higher in the region with high Zn+ concentration/distribution, whereas the intensities of Zn+ and Fe+ were weaker in the region with high Pb
distribution. Based on the ion images of Pb+ and the overlay
of Zn+, the distribution region of galena and sphalerite
particles can be significantly identified, that is, the red region
referred to the distribution of sphalerite particles and the blue
region referred to the distribution of galena particles. It indicates
that Zn+ and Pb+ can be used to easily identify
sphalerite and galena.

of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+ and overlay

Figure 4 shows the
ion images of the samples of galena and sphalerite after mixed grinding.
Partial galena and sphalerite particles can be distinguished by observing Figure 4a, in which some
silver-gray and reflective particles are galena, while some light
brown particles are sphalerite. From ion images of Pb+,
Zn+, and Fe+, the intensities distribution of
Zn+ and Fe+ were similar and showed marked variation
from the Pb+ distribution. However, compared with Figure 3, the intensity of
Pb+ was higher in the region with high Zn+ distribution,
indicating that Pb+ migrated from the galena surface to
the sphalerite surface during the mixed grinding. Ion images of Pb+ and the overlay of Zn+ in Figure 4e were markedly different from those in Figure 3e, and the distribution
region of the sphalerite changed from red to magenta, which was the
overlay of red (Zn+) and blue (Pb+); suggesting
that a certain amount of Pb+ were adsorbed on the sphalerite
surface, that is, Pb+ released from the galena surface
migrated to the sphalerite surface during the mixed grinding.

2.2 Statistical Analysis
Through the
ion-imaging analyses of ToF-SIMS, we qualitatively determined the
migration and adsorption of Pb+ on the sphalerite surface
during grinding. This conclusion is consistent with the early findings
that sphalerite is easily activated by the presence of lead ions in
ore pulp during the flotation of Pb–Zn ore.36 However, the changes in the contents of Pb+,
Zn+, and Fe+ on the surfaces of galena and sphalerite
are still not clear, and until now, no research has reported the effect
of sphalerite on the surface component of galena. In order to study
the migration of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+ on the surfaces of galena and sphalerite during grinding, SurfaceLab
6.8 (ION-TOF GmbH, Münster, Germany) was used for Zn+–Pb+-overlay images, delineating 6 regions of interest
(ROIs) of galena and ROIs of sphalerite.37,38 Then, the mass spectra of each ROI were obtained by data reconstruction
of each ROI, which is shown in Figure 5. Based on the intensities of Pb+, Fe+, and Zn+ peaks in the mass spectra, the normalized
intensities of Pb+, Fe+, and Zn+ in Figure 6 were obtained.

Figure 5 Schematic
diagrams of the ROI data reconstruction.

Figure 6 Statistical analyses of the normalized intensities of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+ peaks. Notes: black bar represents
the galena in the separate grinding sample; red bar represents the
galena in the mixed grinding sample; blue bar represents the sphalerite
in the separate grinding sample; and green bar represents the sphalerite
in the mixed grinding sample.

Figure 6 shows
the
statistical intensities of Pb+, Zn+, and Fe+ on the sphalerite and galena surfaces. It can be seen from Figure 6 that compared with
the galena in the separate grinding sample, the Pb+ intensity
on the surface of galena in the mixed grinding sample decreased, with
a slight increase of Zn+ intensity and no significant change
of Fe+ intensity. Meanwhile, compared with the sphalerite
in the separate grinding sample, the Pb+ intensity on the
sphalerite surface in the mixed grinding increased, with a significant
decrease of Fe+ and Zn+ intensities. These results
show that during mixed grinding, the lead ions released from the galena
surface migrated to and were adsorbed on the sphalerite surface; however,
the zinc and iron ions released by sphalerite were hardly adsorbed
on the galena surface. This indicates that the homogeneity in grinding
was related to the elements the mineral contains. The decrease of
Pb+ intensity on the galena surface shows that sphalerite
also changed the surface component of galena during the mixed grinding
to a certain extent.

The amounts of Zn2+ and Pb2+ released from
sphalerite and galena during grinding were determined by Liu et al.11 and Bai et al.,12 respectively, and their studies showed that the concentrations of
Zn2+ and Pb2+ released by 2 g sphalerite and
2 g galena in the presence of 40 mL of deionized water after grinding
for 10 min were 8.79 × 10–6 and 6.54 ×
10–6 mol/L, respectively. In the present work, 1
g sphalerite and 1 g galena were mixed and ground in the presence
of 2 mL deionized water for 2 min. Ideally, the highest concentrations
of Zn2+ and Pb2+ in the solution should be within
the order of 10–5 mol/L. Based on this, the Eh–pH
diagrams of Pb2+ and Zn2+ were drawn as shown
in Figure 7. Figure 7 shows that Zn2+ and PbOH+ are stable ions at near-neutral pH
conditions. Therefore, according to the analysis results of Figure 6, it can be inferred
that Zn2+ hardly interacts with the galena surface, while
PbOH+ is easily adsorbed on the sphalerite surface.

2.3 PCA Analysis
Although galena and
sphalerite in the study were highly pure natural minerals, yet the
surface changes of the minerals during grinding were still likely
to be very complex.39 Recent studies have
shown that galena and sphalerite contain rich fluid inclusions that
can be destroyed by grinding, and the components will be released
into the ore pulp, which affects the subsequent surface adsorption
and flotation.11,40,41 In addition, the dissolution of the minerals, as well as the effects
of O2 and H2O, also affects the mineral surface
component.21,42−45 Therefore, the changes in the
surface component during grinding may not be fully reflected by only
analyzing the chemical changes of Pb, Zn, and Fe on the surfaces of
galena and sphalerite.

It is difficult or even impossible to
accurately analyze the chemical states of Pb, Zn, and Fe on the surfaces
of galena and sphalerite or to completely determine the surface components
of galena and sphalerite. However, with the aid of the positive/negative
mass spectra of ToF-SIMS, a detailed analysis that contains almost
all the components of material surface can be obtained, which enables
us to comprehensively study the surface components of sphalerite and
galena. Figure 5 shows
the positive ion mass spectra of sphalerite and galena in the mass
range of 52–212 m/z. It is
not difficult to find that the positive ion mass spectra of sphalerite
and galena contain multiple mass peaks. This implies that the comprehensive
surface components of materials can be obtained in theory through
the spectral analysis of ToF-SIMS, which is impossible to accomplish
with complete mass spectrum analysis. To simplify the data interpretation
as well as to classify and discriminate similar compounds, multivariate
statistical analysis such as PCA, which has a wide range of applications
in processing complex ToF-SIMS data, was employed.46−48 Unsupervised
PCA is commonly applied to ToF-SIMS dataset to reduce the data, to
recognize similarities and differences, and to categorize the spectra
into distinguishable groups.49 In order
to determine the changes in the surface components of the two minerals
during grinding, a PCA model was established in this section to evaluate
the interaction of galena and sphalerite.

Figure 8 shows the
results of the PCA based on ToF-SIMS spectral data. The results of
the PCA consist of scores and loadings. In general, peaks with high
loadings on one side of a given PC axis will show higher relative
intensities for samples with high scores on the same side of the given
PC axis. The PCs 1 and 2 captured 77.4 and 17.4% of the total variance,
respectively. As seen in Figure 8a, the samples were separated on the scores plot. The
PCs 1 and 2 loadings plots (Figure 8b,c) show which ions were responsible for the differences
among the samples.

Figure 8 Analysis results of PCA based on ToF-SIMS spectral data:
(a) scores
plot, (b) PC1 loadings plot, (c) PC2 loadings plot. Notes of scores
plot: magenta represents the pure galena; cyan represents the pure
sphalerite; black represents the sphalerite in the separate grinding
sample; green represents the galena in the separate grinding sample;
blue represents the galena in the mixed grinding sample; and red represents
the sphalerite in the mixed grinding sample.

For PC1, the major differences among the considered samples
were
captured. The sphalerite samples have negative PC1 scores (Figure 8a), corresponding
to the peaks, such as C3H3+, Zn+, and Fe+ with negative PC1 loadings (Figure 8b), and the galena
samples have positive PC1 scores, corresponding to the peaks, such
as Pb+, PbOH+, Pb2O+,
and Pb2S+ with positive PC1 loadings. Pure sphalerite
and pure galena have the largest positive PC1 scores and the smallest
negative PC1 scores, respectively, while the sphalerite in the mixed
grinding sample and the galena in the mixed grinding sample have the
largest negative PC1 scores and the smallest positive PC1 scores,
respectively, suggesting that the surface components of the galena
and sphalerite became similar due to the migration of the surface
elements during the mixed grinding. The surface properties of sphalerite/galena
in the separate grinding sample are near to the surface properties
of pure sphalerite/galena in the scores plot.

PC2 is the main
distinction between the galena in the mixed grinding
sample and other samples. The galena in the mixed grinding sample
has the smallest negative PC2 scores (Figure 8a), corresponding to the organic peaks, such
as C3H7O+, 13CC3H9O+, C6H16SN2+, C14H21O2+, and C17H13O4+ with
the smallest negative PC2 loadings (Figure 8c), implying that the organics were adsorbed
to the galena surface during the mixed grinding. It can be speculated
that these organics may mainly be derived from fluid inclusions in
sphalerite because the galena in the mixed grinding sample was distinguished
from other separately ground galena samples. The sphalerite samples
have both positive and negative scores on PC2, and no significant
differences were observed on PC2, reflecting some minor differences
in the sphalerite sample group.

The results of Figure 6 show that the intensities
of Zn+ and Fe+ on the galena surface changed
unobviously, but the intensity of
Pb+ decreased obviously. Combined with the results of PCA,
the adsorption of organics on galena surface may be also a reason
for the decrease of the Pb+ intensity. In summary, the
PCA results reflect that the surface components of sphalerite and
galena after the mixed grinding became more similar, which indicates
that the components of sphalerite and galena migrated to each other’s
surface during the mixed grinding.

3 Conclusions
The change of surface components of sulfide minerals during grinding
is an important factor affecting the selective flotation separation
of galena and sphalerite. Therefore, in this study, we used ToF-SIMS
to demonstrate that there is an interaction between galena and sphalerite
during the mixed grinding. The following conclusions are drawn:

Compared with the galena in the separate grinding sample, the Pb+ intensity on the surface of galena in the mixed grinding
sample decreased, with a slight increase of Zn+ intensity
and no significant change of Fe+ intensity. Meanwhile,
compared with the sphalerite in the separate grinding sample, the
Pb+ intensity on the sphalerite surface in the mixed grinding
increased, with a significant decrease of Fe+ and Zn+ intensities. A PCA model was successfully established, and
its results indicate that the surface components of the galena and
sphalerite became similar in the mixed grinding sample, while the
surface properties of sphalerite/galena in the separate grinding sample
is near to those of pure sphalerite/galena.

These results suggest
that during mixed grinding, the lead ions
released from the galena surface migrated to and were adsorbed on
the sphalerite surface; however, the zinc and iron ions released by
sphalerite were hardly adsorbed on the galena surface. Therefore,
the homogeneity in grinding was related to the elements the mineral
contains.

In summary, this study successfully identified an
important factor
for unintentional activation of lead and zinc minerals during flotation:
homogenization of surface components of different minerals during
grinding.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
In this study, galena and
sphalerite samples were obtained from the natural deposits of Qinghai
and Guangxi in China, respectively, as shown in Figure 9. Galena and sphalerite crystals were manually
selected and then cleaned with deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaner
to remove the surface impurities of the samples. After natural air-drying
for 1 h, the samples were ground using a three-head grinder with agate
mortars and pestles (XPM-Φ120 × 3, China) and thereafter
dry-screened (+0.180 to −0.425 mm size fraction). Quartz sand,
anhydrous alcohol, and deionized water were used to clean agate mortars
and pestles before grinding. The samples (+0.180 to −0.425
mm size fraction) were cleaned with deionized water three times in
an ultrasonic cleaner, each time for 2 min with the liquid poured
out after standing for 1 min. The resulting samples were air-dried
for 1.5 h and then were sealed in spiral glass bottles. The results
of chemical analysis show that the galena contained 86.16 wt % Pb,
13.41 wt % S, 0.11 wt % Fe, and 0.13 wt % Zn, while the sphalerite
contained 64.83 wt % Zn, 31.8 wt % S, 1.97 wt % Fe, and 0.09 wt %
Pb, indicating that galena and sphalerite samples have high purity.

4.2 Sample Preparation
Two grams of galena,
2 g of sphalerite, and 2 g of mixed samples (consisting of 1 g galena
+ 1 g sphalerite) were ground with a three-head grinder, respectively.
The grinding procedure performed for each sample is as follows. The
sample and 2 mL of deionized water were added to the agate mortar
in turn and then ground for 2 min. Finally, 15 mL of deionized water
was used to rinse the solution from the agate mortar and pestle into
the funnel filter. Afterward, the filtered samples were naturally
dried for 2 h and then were immediately used for ToF-SIMS analysis.
Quartz sand, anhydrous alcohol, and deionized water were used to clean
agate mortars and pestles before each grinding.

4.3 Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry
Analysis
ToF-SIMS analyses were conducted using a ToF-SIMS
V (ION-TOF GmbH, Münster, Germany) instrument.50,51 The powder sample was glued to the double-sided conductive adhesive,
purged with nitrogen gas to remove fine particles from the large particle
surface, and thereafter transferred to the instrument sample loading
chamber. After keeping in vacuum for 13 h, the sample was transferred
to the instrument analysis chamber. The pressure in the analysis chamber
was maintained below 5 × 10–8 mbar to avoid
contamination. A pulse of 15 keV Bi3+ primary
ion beam was used, the Bi3+ beam was rastered
over a 500 × 500 μm area in a sawtooth mode of 256 by 256
pixels, giving a pixel size of <5 × 5 μm. The process
was stopped after 112 s of analysis. The positive spectra were calibrated
using C+, CH3+, and C2H5+ before further analysis. Data acquisition
and subsequent data processing were performed using SurfaceLab 6.8
(ION-TOF GmbH, Münster, Germany). The total accumulated primary
ion dose for data acquisition was about 1.26 × 1011/cm2, which was within the static SIMS regime.

4.4 Multivariate Statistical Analysis
For mixed minerals,
the overlay of Pb+ and Zn+ image was divided
into 6 ROIs for galena and 6 ROIs for sphalerite,
respectively. For single minerals,
the 500 × 500 μm analysis region was also divided into
6 ROIs with equal area; the spectra of each ROI were obtained by data
reconstruction using SurfaceLab 6.8. The selection of the mass peak
was determined by peak search program. The mass peaks that meet the
following conditions were selected: mass range, 20–450 m/z; peak area, >5000 counts. A total
of
206 positive ion peaks were selected. The intensity of each peak was
normalized against the total ion intensity statistics of its spectrum,
and then the data matrix was scaled by Poisson scaling52 and mean centering. Finally, PCA was performed
using SIMCA 14.1 (MKS Umetrics, Sweden) software.
