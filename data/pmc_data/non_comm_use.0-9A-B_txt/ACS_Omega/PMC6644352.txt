Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
incorporating poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT) as the hole transport/extraction layer have been broadly investigated
in recent years. However, most PSCs which incorporate PEDOT as the
hole transport layer (HTL) suffer from lower device performance stemming
from reduced photocurrent and low open-circuit voltage around 0.95
V. Here, we report an ultrathin PEDOT layer as the HTL for efficient
inverted structure PSCs. The transparency, conductivity, and resulting
film morphology were studied and compared with traditional architectures
and thicker PEDOT layers. The PSC device incorporating an ultrathin
PEDOT layer shows significant improvement in short-circuit current
density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and power conversion efficiency. Because
ultrathin PEDOT layers can be easily obtained by dilution, this study
suggests a simple way to improve the PSC performance and provide a
route to further reduce the fabrication complexity and cost of PSCs.

1 Introduction
Perovskite
solar cells (PSCs) have made substantial progress as
competitive photovoltaic candidates in recent years.1−7 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has significantly
improved from 3.8 to 22.7%.1,8 The fast rise of device
performance is attributed to the simplification of the device architecture,6,9−12 the improvement of processing for absorber materials, and the development
of efficient charge selective materials.3,9,10,13−16 Additionally, a range of electron- and hole-transporting materials
are helping to drive improved PSC performance.4,9−11,17 To date, the highest
efficiency PSCs with PCE over 20% utilize 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-bifluorene
(spiro-OMeTAD) or poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine)
(PTAA) as the hole transport layer (HTL).3−5,8,10,13,18 Though these types of HTLs exhibit
efficient hole extraction and result in attractive device performance,
the cost of these materials is especially high compared with the perovskite
active layer. In addition, a set of complex additives is required
to improve the film conductivity when using these types of HTLs, which
increases the processing complexity and reduces yield, repeatability,
and reliability.7,8

Poly(3,4-thylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT)
is a common and low-cost HTL material which is broadly used in the
organic electronics field.19,20 PEDOT was first introduced
in PSCs in 2013 and has since become a popular HTL in inverted structure
PSCs because of its flexibility, low-temperature processability, and
ease of fabrication.11,21 However, most PSCs using PEDOT
as the HTL suffer from lower device performance when compared with
the devices using spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA as the HTL.22 The low performance of PEDOT in PSCs are attributed to
the moderate conductivity, parasitic absorption, less suitable work
function, and the influence of pH in the PEDOT precursor solution.23−26 To overcome these disadvantages of pristine PEDOT and improve the
device performance, previous work has focused on modification of the
film work function and surface properties.24−26 For example,
Zhu et al. treated PEDOT films with dimethylformamide (DMF) and other
organic solvents to enhance the conductivity, which led to an increase
in performance from 16.69 to 18.02%.23 Jen
and et al. reported that the modulation of PEDOT pH could reduce the
device potential loss and enhance the device open-circuit voltage
(VOC) from 0.88 to 1.06 V.24 Zuo and Ding adjusted the polystyrene sulfonate
content in PEDOT precursors to change the work function of PEDOT,
transmittance, charge carrier extraction capability, and film morphology.26 It was also reported that hybrid or functionalized
PEDOT films can lead to high efficient PSCs.22,27,28

In this work, we demonstrate the influence
of the PEDOT film thickness
on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs in an inverted structure.
We employ an ultrathin PEDOT film (2 nm) as the HTL in PSCs without
the need for additional processing steps and show that the device
PCE can be significantly enhanced from 16.9 to 19.3%. The ultrathin
PEDOT film is prepared by direct dilution of the PEDOT precursor solution
allowing the formation of films as thin as 0.5 nm. The transparency,
conductivity, and film morphology of the ultrathin PEDOT layer were
studied and compared with thick PEDOT layers. The results suggest
that ultrathin PEDOT layers have unique advantages over thick PEDOT
films when used as HTLs in PSCs.

2 Results
and Discussion
To probe the influence of PEDOT on the device
performance, a batch
of devices with various thicknesses of PEDOT were prepared by varying
the concentration of the PEDOT solution. Solar cells were fabricated
on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates with the device structure ITO/PEDOT/CH3NH3PbI3–xClx (∼320 nm)/C60 (20 nm)/BCP
(7.5 nm)/Ag (Figure 1a). To measure the film thickness, the PEDOT layer was deposited
on precleaned silicon wafer substrates by spin-coating, and then,
the thicknesses was measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. As seen
from Figure 1b, the
thickness of PEDOT layer is found to change linearly with the concentration
of the original PEDOT solution. The thickness is decreased from 47
± 8.4 to 0.6 ± 0.4 nm when the PEDOT solution is diluted
from 100% (original concentration) to 1%. The perovskite film was
then prepared on the PEDOT layer by the vacuum-assist method.29 An electron extraction layer (C60) with the cathode interfacial layer (BCP) was subsequently deposited
on top of the perovskite film, and a silver top electrode was deposited
by thermal evaporation to complete the device fabrication. Figure 1c shows the current–voltage
(J–V) characteristics of
the PSCs. A reference device with a thick (116 ± 10.6 nm) PEDOT
layer was also fabricated to understand the higher thickness influence
on device performance. In addition, a HTL-free (ITO-only) device was
also prepared to compare with the ultrathin PEDOT layer device. Figure 1d shows the external
quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices.

of the concentration of PEDOT precursor solution. (c) Current density–voltage
(J–V) curves of PSCs prepared
with various concentrations of PEDOT precursor solutions. (d) Corresponding
EQE spectra of the perovskite devices.

The solar cell parameters including the short-circuit current
density
(JSC), VOC, fill factor (FF), and PCE are plotted as a function of PEDOT concentration
in Figure 2. All parameters
are gradually enhanced as the PEDOT concentration decreases from 100
to 5%. The 5%-PEDOT device with 2.0 ± 0.6 nm thickness of PEDOT
shows the highest PCE. When the PEDOT concentration further decreases
to 1%, all of device parameters show a sharp drop. Because the thickness
of the 1%-PEDOT layer is less than 1 nm, the extremely thin layer
does not form a completely continuous film. This is similar to the
ITO-only device performance. In contrast, the ultra-thick-PEDOT device
also shows comparable FF, but the JSC and VOC are lower than those of the original PEDOT
device. We deduce that the loss of JSC and VOC are also induced by charge recombination.
For the device with the thickest PEDOT layer (>100 nm), holes cannot
efficiently transfer from the perovskite film to the ITO electrode.
Thus, the J–V results clearly
indicate that the thickness of the PEDOT layer is a crucial factor
for the device performance.

Figure 2 (a) Open-circuit voltage (VOC), (b)
short-circuit current density (JSC), (c)
FF, and (d) PCE as a function of the concentration of PEDOT solution.

We note that the integrated photocurrent
from the EQE spectra is
in good agreement with the trend of device JSC (Figures 1d and 2b). The EQE spectra increase when the
PEDOT concentration is diluted from 100 to 5%. Further dilution of
the PEDOT solution leads to a drop in the EQE. The initial EQE enhancement
with decreasing PEDOT concentration is in good agreement with the
transparency enhancement across the visible spectrum. The transmission
spectra of PEDOT with varying thickness are shown in Figure S1. While the lowest thickness of PEDOT has the highest
transparency, the charge recombination and current leakage more than
offset the contribution of the increased light harvesting. For the
ITO-only device, the lack of the hole extraction layer leads to an
increased recombination at the perovskite film interface and results
in a low EQE as well as low JSC.

To further investigate the effect of the ultrathin PEDOT in PSCs,
the perovskite film and device on the 100%-PEDOT layer and the 5%-PEDOT
layer were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), photoluminescence
(PL), and impedance spectroscopy. The morphologies of the ITO substrate
studied by SEM are shown in Figures 3a–c. When the thickness of the PEDOT film is
over 40 nm, we do not observe the underlying ITO morphology. In contrast,
the 5%-PEDOT layer is more transparent and the bottom ITO substrate
morphology can clearly be observed through the thin PEDOT layer. The
low resistance of the ultrathin PEDOT layer not only ensures the holes
efficiently transport from the perovskite film to the ITO electrode
but also decreases the device series resistance that results in enhanced
device performance. The SEM images of perovskite films prepared on
PEDOT/ITO substrates (Figure 3d–f) show that the films are homogeneous, continuous,
and smooth, and the perovskite films are fully covered on the substrate
with few observable pinholes. It should be noted that the grain size
of the perovskite film on the 5%-PEDOT layer is clearly larger than
the 100%-PEDOT film.

Figure 3 Top-view SEM images of substrates (a–c) and perovskite
films
(d–f) deposited on each substrate. (a,d) 100%-PEDOT film on
ITO. (b,e) 5%-PEDOT film on ITO. (c,f) ITO-only. The scale bar is
1 μm.

Because the surface properties
influence the morphology of the
perovskite film, the surface energies of the 5%-PEDOT film and 100%-PEDOT
film were evaluated by contact angle measurements (Figure S2).30 These results show
the 5%-PEDOT film has a larger water contact angle than the 100%-PEDOT
film, which suggests that the grain size of the perovskite film on
the 5%-PEDOT layer should be larger than the 100%-PEDOT perovskite
film. This phenomenon is in good agreement with the previous report
by Huang’s group.30 The 5%-PEDOT
film with the lowest wetting substrate surface can act to promote
the formation of larger perovskite grain size.

The properties
of the perovskite films were also characterized
by powder XRD. The XRD spectra are shown in Figure S3. The peak intensity of the 5%-PEDOT perovskite film presents
the strongest XRD signal compared with the perovskite film on 100%-PEDOT
and ITO directly. This again indicates the greater potential for larger
grain size and good crystallization with the 5%-PEDOT perovskite film
over the 100%-PEDOT perovskite film. The high quality of the perovskite
films with larger grain size and improved crystallization can significantly
improve the charge transport ability.30

To understand the impact of various thicknesses of the PEDOT
layer
on the transparent electrode surface, the work functions of bare ITO
and ITO/PEDOT layers were characterized by UPS. As show in Figure S4, the work functions of the 5%-PEDOT
layer and the 100%-PEDOT layer are determined to be 5.1 and 5.0 eV,
respectively, from the high binding energy cutoff. In contrast, the
bare ITO shows a work function of 4.8 eV. The increase of work function
(0.1 eV) reduces the energy barrier for hole extraction from the perovskite
film to the PEDOT layer, and an improved built-in potential that results
in an improved VOC of the 5%-PEDOT device.
The improved crystallization of perovskite films discussed above is
also expected to contribute the higher VOC of the device.30

Figure 4a shows
the absorbance and PL spectra for perovskite films on various substrates.
The strong and uniform absorption of all perovskite films in the range
of 400–800 nm indicate the high quality and good light harvesting
ability of each of the perovskite films. The steady-state PL intensity
of the perovskite film on bare ITO substrate is found to be much stronger
than the film on the 100%-PEDOT layer. This phenomenon is consistent
with the previous report by the Snaith group.21 A PL quenching ratio of 85% is found for the 100%-PEDOT layer, which
is similar to the quenching ratio of 82% for the 5%-PEDOT layer. The
result indicates that the thin 5%-PEDOT layer is sufficient to efficiently
extract holes from the perovskite film. While increasing the PEDOT
thickness can slightly enhance the hole transfer efficiency, this
effect is compensated by increased device series resistance.

thicknesses of PEDOT on ITO substrates. (b) Nyquist plots for the
PSCs prepared with various substrates, as measured under 0.1 sun irradiation

solid line is the fitting curve for each dark J–V curves. (d) J–V curves of ITO/PEDOT/MoO3 (20 nm)/Ag devices for measuring

To further study the effect of the PEDOT layer on device
performance,
we performed impedance measurements for each of the devices.31 The Nyquist plot of the devices measured under
0.1 sun illumination at 0.6 V forward bias is given in Figure 4b. The equivalent circuit used
to model the Nyquist plot is also given in Figure 4d. The parameters extracted from the equivalent
circuit are summarized in Table 1. It is clear that the recombination resistance (R2) of the 5%-PEDOT device is double that of
the 100%-PEDOT device, but the residual charge (C2) of the 5%-PEDOT device is an order of magnitude lower
than the 100%-PEDOT device providing an additional explanation for
the higher JSC of the 5%-PEDOT device.
As a result, the charge carrier lifetime of the 5%-PEDOT device is
four times longer than that of the 100%-PEDOT device, which indicates
that the 5%-PEDOT more efficiently transport holes while reducing
carrier trapping and recombination. The ITO-only device shows low
recombination resistance and high charge accumulation and result in
the low charge extraction efficiency. The results of the impedance
analysis clearly indicate that while the HTL is an essential layer
in PSCs, only a very thin PEDOT layer is necessary to obtain the full
benefit of the HTL.

The effect
of PEDOT thickness is also investigated by fitting the
dark J–V characteristics
Shockley diode equation. Figure 4c shows the dark J–V curves for the devices with varying concentration of PEDOT,
which all fit well with the diode equation.31 The fitting parameters are summarized in Table S1. The ITO-only device shows the largest current leakage,
which is over 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the 5%-PEDOT
device. Though the 100%-PEDOT device shows a comparable diode ideality
factor with the 5%-PEDOT devices, indicating similar bulk recombination,
the large current leakage caused by charge recombination at the interfaces
is likely a large contributor to the lower device PCE with the thicker
PEDOT layer. In addition, the improved conductivity of the thinner
PEDOT layers is also expected to contribute to the PCE enhancement
(Figure 4d).26

Figure 5a shows
the J–V curve of champion
devices with the 5%-PEDOT layer and the 100%-PEDOT layer, respectively.
The 5%-PEDOT device shows a PCE of 19.3% with a JSC of 22.7 mA cm–2, a VOC of 1.05 V, and an FF of 79.9%. In contrast, the best
device on the 100%-PEDOT layer only yields a PCE up to 16.9%, with
a JSC of 22.0 mA cm–2, a VOC of 0.968 V, and an FF of 78.8%.
The EQE spectrum of the device is shown in Figure S5 where the integrated photocurrent of the device is 22.1
mA cm–2, which is consistent with the JSC values obtained from J–V measurements. Moreover, the device exhibits negligible
photocurrent hysteresis when measured with forward and reverse bias
(Figure 5b), which
again indicates that the device has efficient charge extraction on
both sides of a high-quality perovskite film so that there is not
an accumulation of space charge.31 We note
that a previous report using a diluted PEDOT solution for the HTL
resulted in good device performance, which is consistent with our
results.32

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have systematically investigated the significant
effect that simple changes in PEDOT thickness can have on the performance
of PSCs. The results indicate that an ultrathin PEDOT layer is beneficial
to form homogenous and uniform perovskite films with a larger grain
size, efficiently extract holes from perovskite film, lower the interface
charge recombination, and lower photocurrent leakage. By moving from
a 40 nm PEDOT layer to a 2 nm PEDOT layer, the device performance
improved from 16.9 to 19.3% with photovoltages consistently above
1.0 V. This study not only provides a simple strategy to improve performance
of PSCs but also could lower the cost of devices by reducing the need
for expensive HTLs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Precursor Preparation
The following materials
were used as received: anhydrous DMF (Sigma-Aldrich),
anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), methylammonium iodide
(Lumtech), PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich), PbCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich),
C60 (MER Corporation), 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline
(BCP, Lumtech), and PEDOT (Clevios PVP AI 4083, 1.3 wt %, Heraeus).
The PEDOT was diluted to various concentrations with deionized water.

The perovskite precursor solution was prepared with the procedure
outlined in our previous report.31 The
solutions were then stirred for 1 h and filtered with 0.45 μm
polytetrafluoroethylene filters before use.

4.2 Device
Fabrication
ITO substrates
were spin-coated with PEDOT solutions at 6000 rpm for 10 s and then
annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The perovskite film was prepared
with the procedure outlined in our previous report.31 The substrates were then coated with C60 (20
nm), BCP (7.5 nm), and Ag (80 nm) in a thermal evaporation chamber
at a base pressure of 3 × 10–6 Torr through
a shadow mask with a device area (12.15 mm2) defined by
the mask.

4.3 Measurement and Characterization
The thickness of the PEDOT film was measured by ellipsometry (Woollam
Vase). The current–density–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) were measured with a
Keithley 2420 source unit in the dark and under AM1.5 G solar simulation
(xenon arc lamp with a spectral-mismatch factor of 0.988) with a scan
rate of 50 mV/s. The light intensity was measured using a calibrated
Si reference cell (NREL) with KG5 filter. EQE measurements were performed
by using a monochromater to select wavelengths from a QTH lamp. The
intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a Si detector using
a chopper and lock-in amplifier. A Bruker D2 phaser system was used
to collected XRD data (Cu Kα, 0.154 nm). Impedance measurements
were collected with an impedance analyzer (μAutolabIII FRA2)
in the frequency range from 105 to 0.01 Hz in logarithmic
steps (dark, 0.6 V forward bias). All the device and structural measurements
were collected on un-encapsulated devices/samples in air. SEM images
were collected using a field-emission SEM (Carl Zeiss Auriga Dual
Column FIB SEM).
