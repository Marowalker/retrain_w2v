Base catalyst and oxidant are usually
necessary to promote the
polymerization of poly(disulfide) oligomers through oxidative coupling
of the terminal SH groups into S–S bonds. In this study, we
prove that self-polymerization of bifunctional (disulfide) oligomer
films can take place in a matter of minutes under UVC irradiation
(254 nm, 10.5 mW cm–2). The resulting insoluble
polymer is characterized using solid-state NMR, 1H T2 NMR relaxation measurements, thermal analysis, and Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy and proves to have similar composition as a
model poly(disulfide) prepared under oxidative conditions, but distinct
physical properties. These differences are explained by a change in
polymer architecture due to a higher ratio of cyclization relative
to linear polymerization. Homolytic photocleavage of internal S–S
bonds creates thiyl groups close to each other, driving an increased
kinetic feasibility for the cyclization reaction by radical coupling.
The subsequent formation of mechanically interlocked macrocycles (polycatenane
network) is proposed to account for film properties analogous to those
of a cross-linked polymer.

I Introduction
Most of the radiation-induced polymerizations described in the
literature require the presence of a photoinitiator.1 In a chain photopolymerization for instance, the photoinitiator’s
decomposition results in radical, anionic, or cationic reactive centers.
Once produced, these species can add many monomer units to yield a
high-molecular-weight polymer. However, some photopolymerizations
are also possible without the addition of an external initiator, providing
benefits in terms of polymer properties and reliability, including
resistance to aging or exposure to weather conditions, and reduced
content of leachable compounds in the plastics materials. The main
developments in this field are based on ionizing radiations, produced
by beams of particles or photons whose energy is sufficient to produce
radicals and/or ionized species through direct excitation of monomer
molecules: electron beams mainly, but also to a less extent hard X-rays
and γ and β radiations.2,3 By contrast,
examples relying on less energetic radiations in the UV range are
much more limited. Most of them are based on a radical-type polymerization
self-initiated under UVC irradiation (100–280 nm), which can
be provided by conventional UV lamps less costly to operate and maintain
than electron beam processing. In this regard, Bowman et al. demonstrated
that thiol-ene photopolymerization could be achieved without the addition
of a radical photoinitiator. Initiating thiyl radicals were photogenerated
through homolytic cleavage of thiol groups at 254 nm; higher wavelengths
(365 nm) were even permitted with more labile thiols.4,5 Another strategy consisted of the UVC irradiation of specific electron-donor/-acceptor
monomers bearing a maleimide chromophore group.6 However, the main developments concerned chemically modified
acrylate monomers such as vinyl or brominated acrylates.7 In addition, self-initiation of conventional
alkyl acrylates proved possible under an excimer lamp (222 or 172
nm)8 or even under a conventional unfiltered
medium-pressure Hg lamp (250–800 nm).9 Despite these developments, it is still of high interest to extend
the range of self-photopolymerizable structures.

In this report,
we show that linear poly(disulfide) (PdS) oligomer
films (HS-(R-SS)n-SH) can form cross-linked
insoluble polymers within minutes when irradiated alone at 254 nm.
Although less common than polyester or polyurethane resins, liquid
low molecular weight PdS containing internal disulfide bonds are commercial
and commonly referred by their trade name Thiokol or Thioplast. They
are extensively used as technical joints for aerospace, construction,
and double glazing—some niche applications where their high
barrier properties and solvent resistance are requested.10,11 The advantage of this solventless cross-linking method would be
to form PdS coatings with high energy efficiency and no additives.
As shown in Figure 1, a conventional polymerization (path 1) includes, on the contrary,
a base catalyst and an oxidant. A bifunctional PdS oligomer is then
chain extended (or cross-linked with higher functionality oligomers)
through oxidative coupling of the terminal SH groups into S–S
bonds. In contrast, our process proceeds without catalyst, oxidant,
and solvent, suggesting a different reaction mechanism. As depicted
in path 2 of Figure 1, we hypothesize UVC radiation to have a twofold effect: first, it
produces thiyl radicals through homolytic cleavage, and subsequent
reaction of these functional end groups with each other causes chain
extension. Second, it may trigger the rearrangement of covalently
reversible internal S–S bonds converting originally linear
PdS chains into macrocycles. Because of solvent-free conditions, mechanical
entanglement of cycles takes place, resulting in cross-linking. As
a result, the network that forms would consist of linear chains together
with interlocked cycles termed as a polycatenane network.12

Figure 1 Path 1 is a chain extension of PdS resins through a conventional
oxidative polymerization. Path 2 converts linear PdS oligomers into
a polycatenane network by bulk self-photopolymerization under UVC
irradiation.

Molecular catenanes are
well-established structures, highly sought
after to form prototypes of molecular machines inspired by nature
(DNA, polypeptides).13 The formation of
polycatenane disulfide networks has already been reported in the literature,
although their precise identification remains very difficult to prove.14 Conducted by Endo et al., the synthesis conditions
used initiator-less bulk polymerization of 1,2-dithiane above its
melting point.15,16 In addition, the photodynamic
properties of disulfide-based molecules and polymers under UVC excitation
have long been known. Bookwalter et al. showed in 1995 that the dominant
pathway of dissociation of aliphatic disulfide molecules following
excitation at 248 nm is the cleavage of the S–S bond.17 This cleavage of the S–S bond leads to
the formation of thiyl radicals capable of reacting in different chemical
processes. Another reported reaction is disulfide–disulfide
metathesis. Otsuka et al. reported in 2009 the synthesis of a polymer
with dynamic properties through this S–S exchange under UV
irradiation (254 nm).18 However, it has
only been recently that these dynamic properties have been exploited
to create a self-healing polymer19−22 or to degrade cross-linked materials23 but never before to induce cross-linking.

Herein, we begin with a liquid film based on a difunctional PdS
resin (PdSSH1, HS-(R-SS)n-SH with R = CH2CH2OCH2OCH2CH2, 1100 g mol–1). Self-photopolymerization (path d 2) was induced by irradiation
with a low-pressure Hg arc (254 nm). To support the above-mentioned
polymerization mechanism, a comparison was made with a model oxidative
polymerization (path 1) using atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant24 and 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD),
a bicyclic guanidine, as the base catalyst. In an effort to make the
comparison more meaningful, this latter reaction was photochemically
triggered using a xanthone propionic acid-protected TBD as the photobase
generator (PBG)25,26 and a 365 nm UV LED to avoid
PdS absorption. To gain a better understanding of the self-photopolymerization
mechanism, chemical and physical properties between the two polymers
were investigated using a range of characterization techniques, including
solid-state NMR, 1H T2 NMR relaxation measurements,
thermal analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

II Results and Discussion
II.I Qualitative Experiments
of PdS Self-Photopolymerization
To assess the self-initiation
ability of bifunctional PdS oligomers
under UVC, scouting experiments were performed using two different
UV sources: a low-pressure Hg arc (254 nm) and a medium-pressure Hg
arc (200–500 nm). Their emission spectra together with the
absorption spectrum of PdSSH1, used as a model PdS resin, are shown in Figure 2. PdSSH1 displays a wide absorption band between 230 and 320 nm, which is
assigned to the combined absorption of disulfide and thiol bonds.27,28 Attributed mainly to the π–σ* molecular orbital
transition of SS bridges, the maximum at 248 nm is very close to the
emission band of the low-pressure Hg arc at 254 nm. At this excitation
wavelength, several studies demonstrated the possibility of S–S
bonds’ homolytic cleavage/metathesis28,29 as well as H abstraction of S–H bonds.5

medium-pressure Hg-Xe arc with a reflector at 254 nm and a low-pressure
Hg arc.

Using the polychromatic medium-pressure
Hg arc (200–500
nm), PdSSH1 yields a solid film
after 5 min irradiation. The film turned out to be fully insoluble
in all tested organic solvents (chloroform, toluene, and THF). Substituting PdSSH1 with thiol oligomers of higher
molar masses (PdSSH2: 2400 g
mol–1; PdSSH3: 4500 g mol–1; Scheme 1) or with a PdSepoxy exhibiting epoxy terminal groups (2600 g mol–1) led to the same outcome. Interestingly, irradiation of PdSSH-1 under inert atmosphere also allowed
solidification, which occurred at the same rate. However, when the
emission of the medium-pressure arc was filtered to cut all wavelengths
below 330 nm (borosilicate glass filter), the film remained in a liquid
state. Conversely, a quasi-monochromatic low-pressure Hg arc (λ
= 254 nm) led to dry films after 8 min irradiation. This set of results
highlights the prevalent role of disulfide bridges in the photochemical
mechanism. Indeed, dry films were obtained only when S–S bonds
were excited. The ability of PdSepoxy to produce a solid film reveals that terminal SH groups are
not required to obtain a solid/cross-linked structure. Moreover, a
solidification is observed for a range of PdS molar masses and without
the need for atmospheric oxygen. Therefore, the self-photopolymerization
process of PdS oligomers is flexible and unlikely to take place via
a photo-oxidation mechanism.

Scheme 1 Structure of PdS Oligomers
II.II Comparison
between Oxidative Photopolymerization
and Self-Photopolymerizations of PdS
II.II.I Solid-State
NMR
Starting from
the oligomer PdSSH1, the self-photopolymerized
film poly(PdSSH1) obtained by irradiation with a low-pressure Hg lamp (254 nm) was
analyzed by 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy. Its structure was
compared with poly(PdSSH1/PBG) obtained by oxidative photopolymerization (365 nm, with
PBG). In this latter case, a mostly linear structure is expected because
reaction proceeds essentially by chain extension through oxidative
coupling between terminal SH groups (path 1, Figure 1). Because both films were insoluble, solid-state
NMR seemed a relevant characterization technique. Figure 3 compares the 1H
MAS spectra of the two as-irradiated polymers as well as the spectrum
of the original PdSSH1 oligomer.
The spectra of the two photopolymers showed strong similarities, suggesting
that the chain backbone was preserved in poly(PdSSH1). However, two differences can be noticed.
First, a significant signal broadening for poly(PdSSH1) compared to poly(PdSSH1/PBG) was observed, as exemplified by
the increase of the resonance line widths of the methylene protons
HD and HE (see inserted table in Figure 3). This can be understood on
the basis of a more rigid structure formed under UVC irradiation.
Second, the self-polymerized sample showed a weak thiol proton signal
at 1.84 ppm (Ha). A thiol conversion of 90% was calculated
versus 98% with poly(PdSSH1/PBG). In addition, the resonance associated with thiol protons
in poly(PdSSH1) was shifted toward
higher chemical displacements (+0.27 ppm) compared with PdSSH1. This displacement may be due to a change
in the environment of the -SH protons, between a viscous resin and
a “polymerized” material. Note that similar line broadening
and thiol conversions were obtained from the 13C MAS +
DEC NMR spectra available in the Supporting Information (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). Consequently,
these first results appear to minimize the occurrence of a UVC-induced
chemical modification of ether or disulfide units constituting the
polymer backbone of PdSSH1. Nonetheless,
all the possible degradation reactions are described in Scheme 2 and their occurrence examined
on a case-to-case basis.

Scheme 2 Four Types of Photoinduced
Degradation Reactions Involving PdS Oligomers
Oxidation
of disulfide bridges
(i), oxidation (ii) or hydrolysis (iii) of the polyether chain, and
self-cross-linking between alkyl radicals (iv).

On the basis of studies dealing with PdS degradation, four possible
side reactions may take place: oxidation of disulfide (i) and ether
groups (ii), polydisulfide hydrolytic degradation (iii), and thiyl-mediated
hydrogen abstraction leading to cross-linking (iv).i. Oxidation of S–S
bonds causes
the formation of sulfonic, sulfinic, or sulfoxide groups. However,
we did not observe the expected chemical shift of the -CH- groups moving downfield due to the effect of an adjacent S =
O group in the 1H (2.8–3.30 ppm) and 13C spectra (46–60 ppm; see Figure S1 in SI),30 thus supporting the absence
of disulfide bridge oxidation.31

ii. Oxidation of poly(ethylene
oxide)
or poly(methylene oxide) is known to form the characteristic formate
groups.32 C-H adjacent to O atom forms
a hydroperoxide, followed by scission to yield a formate. In favor
of this hypothesis, the 1H NMR spectrum of poly(PdSSH1) displayed a low intense peak around
8.15 ppm assigned to HC(=O)-O. However, this resonance
accounts for only 0.5% of the total number of protons, evidencing
the minor character of this side reaction.

iii. Previous studies emphasized the role
of the hydrolytic path in the degradation of PdS oligomers leading
to the formation of hydroxyl-containing compounds.33 Support for this reaction was provided by the 13C spectrum, which yielded a characteristic resonance at 61.3 ppm
(see Figure S1 in SI). Again, the low intensity
of the signal downplays the role attributable to hydrolyzed species.

iv. Finally, the last cross-linking
route
derives from the assumption of Mahon.33 Homolytic cleavage of thiol yields a thiyl radical, which, in turn,
reacts via hydrogen abstraction with methylene from the chain backbone,
likely the CH2 surrounded by two oxygen atoms exhibiting
the weakest C–H bonds. The resultant carbon-centered radicals
from different chains can recombine to form cross-links. However,
such a route is unlikely because of the absence of tertiary carbon
in the 13C spectrum (expected at 100 ppm).34 Additional proof was also provided by the 13C DEPT 135° analysis of the poly(PdSSH1) (Figure S2 in SI).



II.II.II Relaxation Times by
Low Field NMR
The measurement of relaxation times by low
field NMR makes it possible
to differentiate the variations in segment mobility in a polymer and
especially between linear or cross-linked systems.35 The sensitivity of relaxation time measurement to chemical
heterogeneities at the molecular level is due to the local origin
of relaxation, dominated by the environment near the proton. In particular,
the T2 transverse relaxation time is directly
related to the mobility of the segment on which the proton is located.
To measure transverse relaxation time, we used a conventional CPMG
sequence. Figure 4 shows
the decrease in magnetization over time for poly(PdSSH1) and poly(PdSSH1/PBG). In both cases, the measured magnetization M(t) of the material shows two different
profiles, which can be represented by a function with three components,
revealing a heterogeneity in terms of mobility in the two polymers.
In simplified terms, the measured total magnetization relaxation M(t) is a weighted sum of the relaxations
of the different submolecules:  where T2S, T2M, and T2L, respectively,
represent short time (short), intermediate time (medium), and long
time (long). Each relaxation is associated with a different T2 time. The relative contribution of each type
of submolecules to total relaxation is proportional to the number
of protons on these chain fragments. The three values of fi and T2i given (see inserted table in Figure 4) show that the proton relaxation of the
two polymers is qualitatively different. Both poly(disulfide)s present
a signal at short times (T2S less than
0.5 ms), reflecting the segments whose movements are restricted and
corresponding to the relaxation of a solid. Note that this signal
is almost twice as high for poly(PdSSH1) (fS = 31.7%) compared to poly(PdSSH1/PBG) (fS = 18.2%), indicating a higher proportion of
the immobilized chain. The other relaxation times T2M and T2L are also reduced
in this system, indicative of lower mobility. In other words, the
effect of UVC radiation on transverse relaxation is comparable to
that of cross-linking, resulting in a greater rigidity.

magnetization of poly(PdSSH-1) (——) and poly(PdSSH-1/PBG) (-
- -). The inserted table gives the relaxation times T2i for the three types of protons associated
with short time (T2S), intermediate time
(T2M), and long time (T2L) with the corresponding volume fractions fi.

II.II.III Thermal Analysis
The DSC thermograms
of poly(PdSS1) and poly(PdSSH1/PBG) are given
in Figure 5A. In both
samples, a negative glass-transition temperature (Tg, between −50 and −30 °C) characteristic
of a poly(disulfide) elastomer was detected. However, the Tg of poly(PdSSH1) at −38 °C is 10 °C higher, indicating the
formation of a more rigid structure. In both cases, TGA analysis (Figure 5B) shows two decomposition
domains arising at the same temperatures of 210 and 265 °C. However,
the proportion of each domain is significantly different. The structure
of the poly(PdSSH1/PBG) seems relatively homogeneous as exemplified by a ratio for the
two decomposition areas’ ratio of 12/80 (wt %). By contrast,
poly(PdSSH1) formed under UVC
is more heterogeneous with a ratio of 32/62 (wt %). Its inhomogeneity
is also illustrated by a degradation starting at lower temperature
of 107 versus 141 °C.

and poly(PdSSH-1/PBG) (- - -).

II.II.IV FTIR Spectroscopy
Figure 6 shows the FTIR spectrum of
the PdSSH1 oligomer and its evolution
after irradiation. At 365 nm in the presence of PBG, the vibrational
band νS-H at 2560 cm–1 was
substantially decreased due to the expected SH oxidative coupling
into disulfide. Note the appearance of a new vibrational band νC=N at 1643 cm–1 in the poly(PdSSH1/PBG) translating
the TBD photogeneration. Under UVC, new vibrational modes arose in
the spectrum. In agreement with solid-state NMR data, poly(PdSSH1) showed two carbonyl stretching bands
at 1725 cm–1 attributed to the carboxylic acid C=O
stretch from formic esters produced by photo-oxidation of polyether
chains (reaction ii, Scheme 2). The broad massif between 3100 and 3400 cm–1 was suggestive of hydroxyl groups and particularly alcohol groups,
possibly resulting from hydrolysis (reaction iii). However, the low
intensity of these vibration modes provided evidence of negligible
contribution. The most striking difference between the two irradiated
samples was the evolution of the νS-H band.
In poly(PdSSH1/PBG), almost complete consumption of thiol functions was observed during
irradiation in accordance with the NMR data. In poly(PdSSH1), this same vibration band shows surprisingly
an increase in intensity, a broadening (44% increase in area) as well
as a displacement toward the lower wavenumbers (Δυ̅ = −1.7 cm–1) (see Figure 7). These results are contradictory to the
solid-state NMR data giving approx. 90% conversion. This difference
is not entirely clear and can be due to stronger interactions between
SH groups in close proximity in the poly(PdSSH1) structure. Under these conditions, a deviation in
the absorption coefficient can occur, limiting the validity of the
Beer–Lambert law.36

II.III Discussion
on the Self-Photopolymerization
Mechanism
Taken together, our characterization data suggest
different physicochemical properties between self-photopolymerized
poly(PdSSH1) and the model poly(PdSSH1/PBG) prepared
by oxidative photopolymerization. Solid-state NMR and FTIR data supported
minor changes of the initial polydisulfide backbone with some limited
hydrolysis and oxidation reactions of ether units (see reactions ii
and iii in Scheme 2). It makes sense that photodegradation reactions are limited because
of short UVC exposure times (≤8 min). In poly(PdSSH1), the main compositional change was a
significant consumption of −SH terminal groups (90%). This
indicates that thiol homolytic photocleavage could take place under
UVC, leading to the formation of thiyl radicals with the possibility
of chain extension by radical coupling in a manner similar to oxidative
polymerization. However, poly(PdSSH1) showed higher stiffness than poly(PdSSH1/PBG) despite a lower thiol conversion.
In relaxometry, the volumetric proportion of rigid segments (fS = 32%) was twice as important as in poly(PdSSH1/PBG). In addition,
DSC analysis revealed a significantly higher Tg (+10 °C) and TGA data showed a more heterogeneous structure.
This set of results suggests that UVC irradiation could change the
polymer architecture. SS bridges’ excitation might cause a
rearrangement leading to a higher ratio of cyclization to linear polymerization
compared with an oxidative polymerization.

To support this hypothesis, Scheme 3 describes the two
photopolymerization mechanisms depending on the irradiation wavelength.
First, poly(PdSSH1) and poly(PdSSH1/PBG) diverge by
the generation method of thiyl radicals (RS•). In
a conventional oxidative polymerization mechanism (365 nm), there
is no direct excitation of the PdS resin. Photogenerated TBD (pKa ≈ 13.5) deprotonates terminal thiols
to form a thiolate anion RS– acting as a much stronger
nucleophile. This shift enables reaction with atmospheric oxygen to
form thiyl radicals (RS•) and subsequent dimerization
of the radicals to the disulfide (RS-SR). Under UVC, thiyls are generated
by photocleavage of SS37,38 or by photolysis of terminal
HS.27 After this first step, the two systems
share a common step-growth polymerization mechanism where the reactive
species are thiyl radicals. In any step-growth polymerization mechanism
with reagents comprising two terminal groups capable of reacting with
each other (A-A in our case with A = RS•), there
is competition between intramolecular cyclization and linear intermolecular
polymerization. In the two cases, polysulfide macrocycles may form
from backbiting or recombination reactions between 2 ends of the same
chain. In the specific case of UVC irradiation, exchange reactions
between disulfides (metathesis) are also possible.18,23 Linear chains are formed by the coupling of thiyl radicals carried
by different chains. Disulfide/thiyl exchange is also possible, leading
to transfer reaction.

Scheme 3 Polymerization Pathways of a PdS Resin Depending
on the Irradiation
Wavelength (254 or 365 nm)
The probability of cycle formation depends on two antagonistic
trends:39 the stability of the cycle formed
that increases with chain length (thermodynamic factor) and the probability
of encounters between two chain ends that decreases as chain length
increases (kinetic factor). On the first hand, the formation of a
significant quantity of cyclic species compared to linear species
has been widely reported in poly(disulfide).40 The absence of termination agents and the fact that macrocycles
are thermodynamically very close to linear polymers contribute to
cyclization. On the other hand, the kinetic control of cyclization
depends on the probability of spatial approximation between two thiyl
radicals. As the potential size of the cycle increases, the speed
of movement decreases, reducing the probability of encounters between
thiyl functions in the same chain. At 365 nm, only thiyl chain ends
originating from the terminal thiol can meet, which imposes a maximum
distance between active centers equal to the polymer chain length
(Scheme 4). Conversely,
the cleavage of internal S–S bonds under UVC might favor an
increase in the proportion of cyclic species because the RS• radicals are carried by smaller, more mobile and independent chains
that are able to meet more easily. Consequently, the synthesis conditions
under UVC could drive the kinetic control of polymerization, increasing
the trend toward cyclization. In light of this reasoning, the solvent-free
conditions of reaction favor the proximity between cycles and the
formation of intertwining strands forming a network of mechanically
entangled macrocycles. We hypothesize that the increase in the proportion
of macrocycles compared to oxidative photopolymerization could be
at the origin of the formation of a poly(catenane) network. This makes
the poly(PdSSH1) film obtained
by irradiation under UVC properties comparable to cross-linked polymers.
Even if this reasoning is consistent with the experimental results,
we have no direct evidence of polycatenane network formation. Proof
of macrocycles formation, by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry for example,41 was difficult to provide because of the insolubility of the sample.

Scheme 4 Competition between Intramolecular Cyclization and Linear Intermolecular
Polymerization during UV Irradiation of the PdS Resin
At 365 nm in the presence of
PBG (black circled 1), thiyl radicals result from SH deprotonation/oxidation.
Distance between active centers is maximum, driving linear polymerization.
At 254 nm (black circled 2), thiyl radicals result from SH and SS
photolysis. Higher spatial proximity between active centers means
that they are more likely to undergo direct cyclization instead of
linear polymerization.

III Conclusions
Poly(disulfide)s are resins of commercial importance in the polymer
industry. Their cross-linking usually proceeds via the base-catalyzed
oxidative coupling of functional thiol groups. By contrast, the bulk
self-polymerization of the bifunctional oligomer film was proved to
proceed under exposure to UVC irradiation (254 nm) without an oxidant
and base in a few minutes only. Because the resulting film was found
to be insoluble, characterization by solid-state NMR and FTIR techniques
was implemented. Both techniques converged on the fact that the polydisulfide
backbone was mostly preserved, displaying a chemical composition relatively
similar to that of linear model polymers produced by oxidative polymerization.
However, TGA, DSC, and 1H relaxometry revealed different
physical properties, in particular an increase of rigidity, heterogeneity,
and mobility properties close to those of the cross-linked polymer.
To account for these unexpected results, we postulated that UVC radiation
could cause a change of the linear architecture. At 254 nm, thiyl
radicals are produced not only from terminal S–H bonds but
also from internal SS bridges by homolytic cleavage. Because active
centers are more numerous and approach each other, the rate of cyclization
reaction is increased compared to linear polymerization due to kinetic
control. As a result of bulk conditions, a fraction of entangled macrocycles
could form, leading to cross-linking. While the proposed hypothesis
was consistent with the experimental data, we were not able to prove
the formation of the polycatenane network, which is generally a challenge
in the literature. More research is needed to provide pieces of evidence
in favor of this mechanism.

IV Experimental Section

Used as PBG, 2-(9-oxoxanthen-2-yl)propionic
acid 1,5,7-triazabicyclo [4.4.0]dec-5-ene salt was purchased from
TCI. Chloroform (>99%) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Two families
of difunctional liquid PdS prepolymers were supplied by AkzoNobel
(Scheme 1).Thiol-terminated PdS with different
molar masses, Thioplast
G4, G21, and G10 were designated as PdSSH1, PdSSH2, and PdSSH3, respectively.

Epoxy-terminated PdS, Thioplast EPS25, was referred

IV.II Synthesis
IV.II.I Self-Photopolymerization
of PdS Oligomer
(λ = 254 nm)
A liquid PdSSH1 film with a
thickness of 1.5 μm was obtained by casting on a KBr pellet
or glass substrate a solution containing 2 mL of chloroform and 0.48
g of PdSSH1 resin. Deposition was carried out by spin coating
(5 s at 1000 rpm, then 10 s at 2000 rpm). The thickness value was
assessed by a 3D surface profilometer. Irradiation was performed subsequently
at room temperature employing two UVC irradiation sources. The first
is a low-pressure Hg lamp made up of two tubes NIQ 60/35 XL (60 W,
Heræus). Placed 12 cm from the tubes, an almost monochromatic
irradiation at 254 nm was received by the sample under these conditions.
At this distance, the line emitted at 185 nm is almost entirely absorbed
by the oxygen in the air to form ozone, and ozone is evacuated by
the fume hood. The total irradiance measured at the film surface was
10.5 mW cm–2. A dry film was obtained after 8 min
of irradiation. Alternatively, a medium-pressure Hg-Xe arc was used.
It is equipped with a 254 nm reflector (Hamamatsu L8252, 200 W) to
maximize the emission at 254 nm. In this case, the radiation was directed
toward the sample by a waveguide placed perpendicularly 3 cm from
the sample. The total irradiance measured at the film surface was
390 mW cm–2 (200–500 nm). For inert atmosphere
experiments, the samples were placed in an environmental control chamber
where the temperature and atmosphere could be adjusted.

IV.II.II Oxidative Photopolymerization of PdS
Oligomer in the Presence of PBG (λ = 365 nm)
A typical PdSSH1/PBG formulation
was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of PBG in 4 mL of chloroform containing
0.48 g of PdSSH1 resin. This homogeneous and photolatent
mixture was then deposited onto a KBr or glass substrate by spin coating
(5 s at 1000 rpm and 10 s at 2000 rpm) to obtain a 1.5 μm-thick
film. The irradiation was performed by a monochromatic 365 nm LED
(Phoseon Technology FJ200), which allowed obtaining a solid film after
180 s of exposure. The irradiance at 365 nm was 560 mW cm–2. At this emission wavelength, excitation of disulfide
functions, which may cause S–S bonds’ dissociation or
metathesis, was prevented.

IV.III Methods
UV–vis absorption
spectra were acquired between 190 and 800 nm in acetonitrile with
a Cary 4000 Spectrophotometer from Varian using a 10 mm quartz cuvette.

Real-time Fourier transform infrared (RT-FTIR) spectra were obtained
with a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled
mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector working in the rapid scan
mode. The resolution of the spectra was 4 cm–1 with
an average of 4 scans s–1. The conversion rate of
thiol functions over time was determined by integration of the SH
stretching band at 2570 cm–1. All analyses were
repeated three times from samples prepared separately.

1H and 13C liquid NMR (400 MHz) spectra of
PdS resins were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker Advance 400
spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm Z-gradient QNP (1H, 13C, 19F, 31P) probe for routine spectroscopy.
The chemical shifts were referenced to the residual proton signal
of the solvent CHCl3 at 7.26 ppm for 1H.

Solid-state 1H MAS NMR and 13C MAS + DEC
NMR experiments were performed at room temperature on a Bruker Avance
II 400 spectrometer operating at B0 =
9.4 T (Larmor frequency ν0 = 400.17 MHz). Single
pulse experiment was recorded with a double channel 2.5 mm Bruker
MAS probe, a spinning frequency of 30 kHz, a π/2 pulse duration
of 2.9 μs, and a 5 s recycling delay. 1H spin–lattice
relaxation times (T1) were measured with
the inversion-recovery pulse sequence. Typically, 64 scans were recorded.
Chemical shifts reported thereafter are relative to tetramethylsilane 1H. The deconvolution of the experimental 1H MAS
spectrum was carried out with DMfit software. The conversion of thiol
functions after irradiation can be calculated using deconvolutions
of NMR spectra. For 1H MAS spectra, the calculation is
performed by considering the signal area corresponding to the -SH
protons with respect to the protons associated with the O-CH2-O function as a reference. All analyses were repeated two times
from samples prepared separately.

Low field NMR 1H NMR relaxation experiments were performed
in 10 mm NMR tubes on a Bruker Minispec MQ-20 spectrometer operating
at proton resonance frequency of 20 MHz. The experiments were performed
at 45 °C (initial magnet temperature) under static conditions.
Before performing the analysis, proton spin–lattice relaxation
times T1 were measured with the inversion-recovery
pulse sequence  The measurement of
the time T1 allowed us to optimize and
set the recycle delay in
the following analyses. Next, proton spin–spin relaxation times
(T2) were measured with different sequences
and, in particular, by using the free induction decay (FID)  and the Carr–Purcell–Meibloom–Gill
(CPMG) pulse sequence (with CYCLOPS cycling)  where x and y are the radio-frequency phases of the pulses
with angles π/2
and π, respectively, and τ is the interpulse spacing.
τ was taken at the value of 0.05 ms for all the analyses. This
time is the minimal value to prevent the T1ρ effect and to limit the initial intensity loss. The CPMG decay curves
were deconvoluted by using a sum of exponential functions  where Ai and T2,i are,
respectively, the proportion and transverse relaxation time of the
proton population i. FID is the simplest NMR sequence,
and its intensity is directly proportional to the total amount of
protons in the sample.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was
carried out with TGA Q500
(TA Instruments) under nitrogen atmosphere (20 mL min–1). Then, 9 mg of an irradiated PdS film was placed in an open aluminum
pan and heated from ambient conditions to 900 °C at 10 °C
min–1.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
was carried out on TA Q2000
DSC using a heat–cool–heat thermal cycle. Next, 5 mg
of a poly(disulfide) film was placed in a hermetic aluminum pan. The
first cycle started by heating the sample from −90 to 100 °C
at 10 °C min–1. The second cycle cooled the
sample back to −90 °C. The third step heated the sample
again from −90 to 100 °C at 10 °C min–1.

Profilometry measurement of the liquid PdS films was carried
out
using a Dektak 150 (Bruker) profilometer.
