A new water-soluble
reactive perylene tetracarboxylic diimide derivative
(PDI-pfp) is designed and synthesized that can realize fast imaging
of the endoplasmic reticulum in living cells. The PDI-pfp comprises
three functional moieties: perylene tetracarboxylic diimide as fluorescent
backbone, poly(ethylene glycol) for providing good water disperse
ability, and pentafluorophenol active ester as the reactive group
under physiological condition. On the basis of covalent reaction between
the active ester group of PDI-pfp and amine groups on cytomembrane,
PDI-pfp can rapidly interact with cytomembrane, followed by uptake
by living MCF-7 cells within 1 min and also exhibit low cell cytotoxicity.
Furthermore, it is proved that PDI-pfp acts as a universal imaging
agent for other types of cells. This fluorescent probe is of great
potential for the application in the rapid imaging of organelles in
cells.

Introduction
On account of the properties of intuition,
multi-information, high
sensitivity, and specificity,1−6 indispensable and emerging fluorescent probes and materials for
cell imaging have been greatly developed.7−10 Compared to fluorescent proteins11 and fluorescent nanoparticles,12−16 organic dyes, which have smaller size, higher emission intensity,
and broader available spectral range, play an important role in fluorescence
imaging of cells.17−20 Furthermore, the design and synthesis of advantageous cell imaging
materials with good water solubility, high fluorescence quantum yield,
good biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity are extremely imperative.

Perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) and its derivatives with
excellent redox and optical properties as well as superior photochemical
and thermal stabilities21−24 have been extensively applied in organic pigments,
electrophotography, and photovoltaic cells.25−28 Owing to the delocalized π-electronic
rigid plane structure, PDI is endowed with high fluorescence quantum
yield and, recently, has been widely utilized as a chromophore.29 However, the hydrophobic backbone of PDI results
in its poor solubility in aqueous solution, which has greatly limited
its application in biological systems. Two strategies have been employed
so far to enhance the water solubility of PDI: 1) the attachment of
hydrophilic chains at the imide nitrogen of PDI;30,31 and 2) the introduction of charge groups at the bay region of PDI.32

Pentafluorophenol active ester exhibits
high reactivity with many
functional groups,33−35 especially with amino groups under physiological
conditions. Therefore, pentafluorophenol ester as an active group
could be used to facilitate fluorescent probe to enter cells because
of the widely distributed amino groups on the cell surfaces.36 In this work, we report the design and synthesis
of a new water-soluble reactive perylene tetracarboxylic diimide derivative
(PDI-pfp) with high brightness, good water solubility, and high chemical
reactivity. By introducing oxylalkyl chains to PDI, the water solubility
is enhanced without affecting its high fluorescence quantum yield
because of the inappreciable influence of N-substituent for nodes
of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals of PDI.21 Pentafluorophenol active ester offers PDI-pfp a high reactive group
to interact with cells. It was demonstrated that the PDI-pfp exhibited
low cytotoxicity and sufficient fluorescence ability for rapid imaging
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in living cells.

Results and Discussion
The synthetic procedure of PDI-pfp is shown in Scheme 1. The precursor molecule PDI–COOH
was first synthesized by reacting perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride (PDI) and NH2-PEG10-COOH in imidazole
at 130 °C for 5 h with a yield of 70%. PDI-pfp was then prepared
by esterification of PDI–COOH with pentafluorophenol in the
presence of N,N-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) in
dichloromethane overnight with a yield of 53%. All of the chemical
structures were confirmed by the 1H NMR and mass spectra.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedure of PDI-pfp
The photophysical properties of PDI–COOH and PDI-pfp
were
investigated in aqueous solution because the linkage of low toxic
and uncharged alkoxy chains extremely enhanced their solubility. UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of PDI and PDI-pfp were
measured in aqueous solution. As shown in Figure 1, owing to the fact that both PDI–COOH
and PDI-pfp consist of the same backbones, they exhibited quite similar
absorption with a maximum peak at 498 nm. On the basis of Lambert
Beer’s law, molar absorption coefficients of PDI–COOH
and PDI-pfp were calculated to be 2.7 × 105 and 1.9
× 105 M–1 cm–1, respectively. Moreover, PDI-pfp has nodes in the orbital HOMO and
LUMO at nitrogen atoms, which cause decoupling of single bonds between
nitrogen atoms and substitutions.14 Thus,
compared to the precursor molecule PDI–COOH, there is less
influence on the fluorescence of PDI-pfp. PDI-pfp exhibited a bright
green fluorescence with a maximum emission at 548 nm and an absolute
fluorescence quantum yield of 0.35 in aqueous solution, which shows
good potential for fluorescent imaging.

and fluorescence emission spectra of PDI–COOH
and PDI-pfp in aqueous solution. The excited wavelength of 507 nm
was used for emission spectra.

Low cytotoxicity is necessary for fluorescent probes to be
utilized
in cell imaging and biology applications.37 Cytotoxicities of PDI-pfp and PDI–COOH were investigated
through a standard MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) assay, in which optical density values of formazan
reduced from MTT by dehydrogenase in mitochondria of viable cells
were measured. In this experiment, MCF-7 cells were incubated in 96-well
culture plates treated with different concentrations of PDI and PDI-pfp
for 30 min. Then, the supernatant was discarded, and MCF-7 cells were
continuously cultured in fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) for the next 24 h, and cell viabilities were measured
and calculated. As shown in Figure 2, PDI–COOH displayed nearly nontoxic behavior
up to 10 μM concentration, whereas PDI-pfp also exhibited less
cytotoxicity at concentrations lower than 10 μM, indicating
their good biocompatibility for cell imaging.

Figure 2 Viability of MCF-7 cells
after incubating with PDI-pfp and PDI–COOH
for 30 min treatment. [PDI-pfp] or [PDI–COOH] = 0–10
μM.

The ability of imaging for living
cells of PDI-pfp was then determined
using MCF-7 cells. To investigate the effect of pentafluorophenol
active esters of PDI-pfp on cell imaging, PDI–COOH without
pentafluorophenol active esters was also studied as control. To accomplish
this, considering the cell viability in Hank’s balanced salt
solution (HBSS), the incubation time was set as 30 min. MCF-7 cells
were treated with PDI–COOH and PDI-pfp for 30 min, and the
treated cells were washed with Hank’s balanced salt solution
(HBSS), followed by the addition of serum-free medium into the plates
for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) characterization. As
shown in Figure 3,
PDI-pfp with pentafluorophenol active esters as terminal groups could
uptake into MCF-7 cells and well stain cells. It is noted that MCF-7
cells internalized by PDI-pfp were observed in a good condition.
Compared with PDI-pfp, PDI–COOH with carboxyl groups at the
terminal position being negatively charged in aqueous solution is
believed to be repelled by the negatively charged membrane of cells,
leading to no interaction between PDI–COOH and MCF-7 cells.
Furthermore, the imaging results indicated that PDI-pfp with higher
concentration (10 μM) stains cells better than that with lower
concentration (5 μM).

Figure 3 CLSM images of MCF-7 cells incubated with PDI–COOH
and PDI-pfp
(5 and 10 μM) for 30 min. The excitation wavelength was 488
nm, and the fluorescence images were collected at the signals from
500 to 600 nm.

To further confirm the
localization of PDI-pfp inside cells, MCF-7
cells were incubated with PDI-pfp for 30 min, and then dyes using
specific imaging of organelles in cells were added. It was observed
that the location of PDI-pfp was well overlapped with that of ER Tracker
Red, which is used for specific staining of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) in cells (Figure 4a), while poor overlaps were seen with those of other organelle-specific
dyes. A white line that was randomly selected in the fluorescent image
of MCF-7 cells was chosen for obtaining the Pearson coefficient (Figure 4b). The value of
the Pearson coefficient was calculated to be 0.79178, which showed
that PDI-pfp was uptaken into cells and mainly located in the endoplasmic
reticulum.

Figure 4 (a) Colocalizing with endoplasmic reticulum-specific ER Tracker
Red after treating MCF-7 cells with PDI-pfp for 30 min. (b) Line-series
analysis of PDI-pfp with ER Tracker Red. The Pearson coefficients
were calculated along the white line on the MCF-7 cells. PDI-pfp and
ER Tracker Red were excited at the wavelengths of 488 and 559 nm,
respectively.

Rapid imaging of cells
is an overwhelming superiority of biomaterials.
The incubating times of cells with PDI-pfp at 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60
min were set as a time node to investigate the imaging ability of
PDI-pfp toward cells. Figure 5a demonstrates that PDI-pfp could be internalized immediately
and distributed in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells even within 1 min.
With the extension of incubation time, the accumulation amount of
PDI-pfp increased and maintained the same distribution in MCF-7 cells.
It was noted that the accumulation amount of PDI-pfp did change up
to 10 min. To prove the generality of PDI-pfp in rapid imaging toward
cells, HeLa cells were chosen as the representative of cancer cells,
and 293T cells were chosen as the representative of normal cells for
imaging experiments. As shown in Figure 5b,c, similar imaging results for HeLa cells
and 293T cells by PDI-pfp were observed as that of MCF-7 cells. Thus,
PDI-pfp exhibits great potential for application in the rapid imaging
of cells within 1 min. The uptake is the main driving force for the
fast internalization of PDI-pfp, and the reaction between PDI-pfp
containing pentafluorophenol active ester groups and amino groups
on the surface of cells assists the process.31

incubation times: (a) MCF-7 cells; (b) HeLa cells; and (c) 293T cells.
PDI-pfp were excited at the wavelength of 488 nm, and the fluorescence
images were collected at the signals from 500 to 600 nm.

Conclusions
In summary, a new water-soluble
reactive perylene tetracarboxylic
diimide derivative, PDI-pfp, with pentafluorophenol active ester on
the ends of the backbone was designed and synthesized. The alkoxy
chains efficiently enhanced the solubility of PDI-pfp in aqueous solution.
PDI-pfp exhibited low cell cytotoxicity and realized rapid imaging
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of living cells. The high reactivity
between pentafluorophenol active ester groups and amino group on the
cell surface led to the fast uptake of PDI-pfp into cells even within
1 min. PDI-pfp exhibited generality of rapid imaging toward different
types of cells, including cancer cells (MCF-7 and HeLa cells) and
normal cells (293T cells). This fluorescent probe is of great potential
for application in the rapid imaging of organelles in cells.

Optical Experiment
First, 10 μM
PDI-pfp and 10
μM PDI–COOH in aqueous solution (with DMSO less than
1% to improve the water dispersibility) were separately used to investigate
the photophysical properties, and the UV–vis absorption spectra
and fluorescent emission spectra (excited at 507 nm) were obtained.
The absolute fluorescence quantum yield of PDI-pfp in distilled water
was measured at an excited wavelength of 507 nm.

Cell Viability
Assay
Breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7
cells) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at
37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were seeded
in a 96-well culture plate at a concentration of 8 × 104 cells per mL and grown for 24 h. After washing with Hank’s
balanced salt solution (HBSS), different concentrations of PDI–COOH
and PDI-pfp dissolved in HBSS were added separately. Addition of HBSS
was considered as the blank group. This was followed by washing with
PBS and adding culture medium again. After incubating for 24 h and
abandoning the culture medium, 100 μL of 1 mg mL–1 MTT in HBSS was added into each well and incubated at 37 °C
under 5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 h. The supernatant was discarded,
followed by the addition of 100 μL of DMSO per well to dissolve
the formazan. A microplate reader measured the absorbance value of
each well at a wavelength of 520 nm. The cell viability rates were
calculated with the following equation  where A is the absorbance
value of the experimental group to which was added PDI or PDI-pfp. Ab is the absorbance value of the group without
cells. A0 is the absorbance value of the
control group with cells to which was added HBSS alone.

Localization
Analysis of PDI-pfp in MCF-7 Cells
PDI-pfp
was dissolved to prepare 10 μM solution in HBSS. First, 1 μM
ER Tracker Red solution was prepared with HBSS. MCF-7 cells were incubated
in 35 × 35 mm plates. After washing with HBSS twice, MCF-7 cells
were incubated with 1 μM ER Tracker Red solution for 30 min.
Then, the supernatant was discarded before washing with HBSS again.
MCF-7 cells were incubated with 10 μM PDI-pfp solution for 30
min. Cells were washed with HBSS followed by adding serum-free culture
medium, and then the fluorescence images of MCF-7 cells were recorded
by CLSM; PDI-pfp and ER Tracker was, respectively, excited at the
wavelengths of 488 and 559 nm.

Cell Imaging with PDI-pfp
and PDI–COOH
Human
cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa cells) and human epithelial cells (293T)
were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Then, 5 μM and 10 μM of PDI–COOH
and PDI-pfp solutions were prepared with HBSS, respectively. MCF-7
cells, HeLa cells, and 293T cells incubated in 35 × 35 mm plates
were washed with HBSS twice before using. Washed MCF-7 cells were
incubated with 5 and 10 μM of PDI–COOH and PDI-pfp solutions
at 37 °C for 30 min. In addition, washed MCF-7 cells, HeLa cells,
and 293T cells were incubated with the addition of 10 μM of
PDI-pfp solutions at 37 °C for 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min. Discarding
the supernatant and washing with HBSS twice was followed by adding
serum-free culture medium, and then the fluorescence images of cells
were recorded by CLSM using 488 nm as excitation wavelength.
