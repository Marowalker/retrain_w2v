The photoreaction
of the antioxidant ellagic acid (EA) elicits a drastic
coloration in solution from colorless to yellow
in aerated tetrahydrofuran, which appears as a new absorption band
at 405 nm. Analysis of the X-ray crystal structure suggests that the
photo-oxidation product of EA is a multiple cleavage
π-structure (Ox-EA) that results from the interaction
of EA with singlet oxygen followed by sequential cleavage
and rearrangement steps.

==== Body
Introduction
Among a variety of
π-conjugated hydrogen-bonded molecules,
ellagic acid (EA) has an interesting molecular structure
comprising a planar biphenyl moiety bridged by two lactone rings and
four hydrogen-bonding −OH groups.1EA is mainly found in raspberries, blackberries, strawberries,2,3 nuts, seeds, and fruit liquors4,5 as a polyphenol derivative.
Its planar π-structure also has both hydrogen-bonding acceptor
(lactone) and donor (−OH) sites, and its antioxidant and anticancer
effects have attracted much attention. For instance, the high reactivity
of EA with the strong carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene-diol epoxide, a metabolic product from benzo[a]pyrene, inhibits DNA mutation through its binding at guanine.6,7 Although several reports about the antioxidant effects of EA have
emerged, a molecular-level understanding of the reaction mechanism
is absent.8

The antioxidant effects
of EA have been reported in
terms of active radical oxygen species such as O2• and OH• as scavengers.9 However, relatively little has been reported on its antioxidant
effects against nonfree radical oxygen species such as singlet oxygen
(1O2), triplet oxygen (3O2), superoxide (O2–), and peroxide (H2O2). Clearly, understanding the reaction mechanisms
of EA with various O2 species is valuable
to more fully understand the antioxidant effect of π-molecules.
To this end, photocoloration phenomena of EA in
aerated tetrahydrofuran (THF) from colorless to yellow following photo-irradiation
were observed.

Result and Discussion
The π-planar
structure of EA was drastically
changed to a twisted Ox-EA structure (Scheme 1), as confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis. Broadly, evaluating the photoreaction
of EA has the potential to provide new insight into the
antioxidant effects of EA.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures
of EA and Its Photoreaction Product
(Ox-EA) in THF
The absorption maximum of EA in THF was observed
at
367 nm, which could be assigned to a highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition,
whereas the fluorescence spectra also showed an emission band at 376
nm, with a small Stokes shift of 10 nm (Figure S1). Interestingly, photoirradiation of EA at
280–400 nm in aerated THF drastically changed its absorption
spectrum (Figure 1a).
The absorption intensity at 367 nm gradually decreased following photoirradiation
and a new absorption band around 400 nm appeared, which also changed
the solution color from clear to yellow (Figure 1b). An isosbestic point was observed at 373
nm during the spectral change of EA in THF, suggesting
the interconversion of EA and a photoreaction product
with a negligible steady-state concentration of reaction intermediates.
The completion of the photoreaction was confirmed by time-dependent 1H NMR spectra (Figure S2). The
absorption band of the biphenyl π-core at 253 nm was drastically
suppressed by the photoreaction; it is expected that the π-conjugated
structure of EA would be significantly modulated by photoirradiation
with concomitant photo coloration behavior. Notably, such photocoloration
behavior of EA was not observed in highly polar solvents
like dimethylformamide (DMF) and CH3OH (Figure S3).

Figure 1 Photocoloration behavior of EA in THF. (a)
Time-dependent
absorption spectra of EA in THF following photoirradiation.
(b) Colorless to yellow color change following photoirradiation.

Two types of optical filters—I
(λex = 280–400
nm) and II (λex > 400 nm)—were used for
the
photoreaction in order to evaluate the wavelength dependence of the
irradiation light (Figure S4). Utilization
of filter I induced a complete conversion of EA to Ox-EA, with saturation of the absorption intensity at 403
nm within 300 min. By comparison, the photoreaction progressed much
more slowly with filter II, at approximately 10% conversion under
the same condition. Therefore, the optical absorption of EA can effectively indicate the extent of photocoloration and the consequent
photoreaction.

Yellow-colored single crystals isolated from
the photoreaction
products were utilized for the X-ray single-crystal structural analysis
(Figures S5 and S6). The relatively low
yield of 26% was due to a loss of the reaction product during the
purification. Both the time-dependent UV–vis and 1H NMR spectra supported the existence of clear and complete photoreaction
(Figures 1a, S2, and S7). The planar π-conjugated structure
of EA was transformed to an asymmetrical π-structure
(Ox-EA) by multiple bond cleavages (Figure 2a). The absorption spectrum
of the yellow crystals in THF was completely consistent with that
of the photoreaction products indicated by the absorption band at
403 nm (Figure 2b).
As seen in Scheme 1, one O2 molecule was formally added to EA to generate the Ox-EA photoreaction product, which
drastically changed the electronic structure of EA. The
C–O bond lengths in Ox-EA were consistent with
the formations of ether (C–O–C), carbonyl (C=O),
and carboxylic acid (−COOH) groups (Figure S6). During the photoreaction, one lactone ring was cleaved
and twisted to form Ox-EA, and the biphenyl π-core
within EA was broken to form a new lactone ring. In addition,
the four terminal −OH groups of EA were partially
transformed to −COOH. Both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the photoreaction product also support the formation
of Ox-EA (Figures S8 and S9). Only one aromatic signal, with a chemical shift of δ = 7.35
ppm, was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of EA, whereas two types of aromatic signals were confirmed at δ
= 7.21 and 7.54 ppm in the Ox-EA spectrum. By comparison,
14 distinct independent signals caused by the low molecular symmetry
of Ox-EA were apparent in its 13C NMR spectrum.
These signals were consistent with simulated chemical shifts based
on density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
level of theory.10

the photoreaction products of EA. (a) Molecular structure
of Ox-EA based on single-crystal
X-ray structural analysis at 100 K. (b) Absorption spectra of EA, EA after the photoreaction (P.R. of EA), and Ox-EA in THF.

The decrease of the absorption intensity at 254 nm was consistent
with the formation of Ox-EA in the absence of a biphenyl
π-core. DFT calculations of EA and Ox-EA at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory also supported their different
HOMO–LUMO gaps of 4.21 eV (EA) and 3.33 eV (Ox-EA), where the LUMO of EA was approximately
1.2 eV higher in energy than that of Ox-EA (Figure S10).

The molecular formula of Ox-EA could be formally determined
by the addition of one oxygen molecule to the EA, suggesting
that molecular oxygen in THF served as a necessary input for this
photoreaction. To this end, the photoreaction of EA was
examined in both aerated and nitrogen-purged THF (Figure 3a).11 Notably, no photoreaction of EA occurred in the absence
of O2 in THF. Therefore, dissolved O2 is needed
for the photo-oxidation reaction of EA in THF. Because EA itself is stable under ambient conditions (Figure 3a), its reaction with O2 should initiate this photoreaction.

of EA following photoirradiation.

(b) Linear relation between the reaction product concentration and
reaction time.

Two types molecular oxygen,
either singlet 1O2 or triplet 3O2, possibly contributed to the
photoreaction of EA in THF. Di(tert-butyl)hydroxytoluene
(BHT) has previously been used as a reaction inhibitor
of 3O3 in THF.12 On
this basis, the photoreaction efficiency of EA was examined
in photoreaction solvents with and without BHT in THF.
A slight broadening of the absorption band at 403 nm of Ox-EA was confirmed in the THF solution without BHT during
a 24 h photoirradiation period (Figure S12), suggesting decomposition of the reaction products caused by the
presence of 3O2. Therefore, the photoreaction
proceeds in the presence of 1O2 as EA + 1O2 = Ox-EA. Photoreaction
of EA was not observed in either DMF or CH3OH. A similar solvent-dependent inactivation of the photoreaction
of the bacteriorhodopsin dimer (BC1) has been reported
in 1O2-containing DMF and CH3OH.13 The formation of 1O2 species
by the excited-state BC1* was suppressed in highly polar
solvents. These results also support our observations that singlet
oxygen generated by the photosensitizing reaction of EA promoted this photoreaction. The reaction rate of EA + 1O2 = Ox-EA in THF was determined
by a spectroscopic method with an initial [EA0] concentration of 500 μM, where the photoreaction, which occurs
under ambient conditions of the instrument, is supplied with a sufficient
amount of O2. Time-dependent spectral changes of the absorption
band at 403 nm by the photoirradiation decrease the concentration
of the photoreaction product [Ox-EA], which gives a reaction
rate of k = 7.8 × 10–5 s–1 assuming a first-order reaction.

The photoreaction
of π-molecules with 1O2 has been identified
as [4 + 2] or [2 + 2] cyclization reactions
(Scheme 2).14−17 The stabilities of possible [4 + 2] and [2 +
2] cyclization products of EA with oxygen were
evaluated using DFT calculations based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level
of theory (Scheme 2 and Figure S13). The most stable 1O2 adduct for EA was the reaction
intermediate of the [2 + 2]-1 structure, whose energy
was 61.0 and 73.6 kJ mol–1 lower than those of the [2 + 2]-2 and [4 + 2] cyclization products, respectively
(Scheme 2). Effective
conjugation in [2 + 2]-1 imparts it with relatively high
stability, whereas destruction of this π-conjugation in the [4 + 2] cyclization process destabilizes the intermediate
structure. Although no reaction intermediates were detected, a plausible
mechanism for this photoreaction is proposed in Scheme 2b. Specifically, the photogenerated dioxetane
intermediate [2 + 2]-1, which is unstable, is easily
cleaved to form a tricycle intermediate A with a terminal
conjugated enol carboxylic acid group. Sequential ring-rearrangement
reactions between the terminal enol and the reactive acid anhydride
then produce the stable Ox-EA product. Overall, then,
selective formation of dioxetane followed by structural rearrangements
affords Ox-EA.

Scheme 2 Photoreaction Mechanism of EA in THF; (a) Relative Stability
of Three Possible Intermediate EA–Oxygen Adducts;
(b) Photoinduced Oxidation Mechanism of EA to Form Ox-EA
In conclusion, the
photoabsorption of EA in aerated
THF generated excited-state 1EA*, which was
transformed from the singlet to the triplet state by intersystem crossing.
The reaction of triplet 3EA* with O2 generated dissolved singlet 1O2 in THF, which
reacted with the π-planar structure of EA and formed
an unstable dioxetane intermediate by a [2 + 2] cyclization
reaction. Stepwise cleavages of the biphenyl π-core formed a
dioxetane structure with concomitant intramolecular ring rearrangement
between the enol oxygen and acid anhydride, which drastically modified
the molecular and electronic structure of EA to form
the photo-oxidation product Ox-EA. A possible antioxidant
reaction mechanism of EA via its photoreaction in THF
is proposed.

Experimental Section
General Methods
Commercially available reagents and
solvents were used without further purification. Chemical shifts (δ)
in ppm were referenced to residual nondeuterated solvent (1H 1.72 ppm and 13C 67.2 ppm for THF-d8). Mass spectra were obtained in the FAB negative mode
with a magnetic sector mass spectrometer. Infrared (IR, 400–4000
cm–1) spectra were measured with a resolution of
4 cm–1.

Photocoloration of EA
Photocoloration
of EA was monitored with the UV–vis spectrum. UV-light (280–400
nm) or visible light (>400 nm) was irradiated to a solution of EA (3.78 mg, 12.5 μL) in dry THF [50 mL, aerated or
degassed (N2 bubbling)] with a 150 W mercury xenon lamp
through a filter. The time course of the UV–vis spectrum of
this solution was monitored every 30 min after dilution of the solution
to 50 μM.

Photoreaction of EA and Isolation
of EAO Single Crystal
UV-light (280–400
nm, 150 W mercury
xenon lump) was irradiated to a stirred solution of EA (30.2 mg, 100 μmol) in dry THF (100 mL) at room temperature
for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated, and the resulting solid was
suspended with CH2Cl2 to give an orange solid
(28.3 mg), which contains Ox-EA as a major product. A
part of the solid (10.5 mg) was suspended in a small amount of acetone,
and the insoluble material was removed by filtration. Toluene was
added to the filtrate, and slow evaporation of the solvents gave Ox-EA single crystals (2.7 mg, 26%).

The
positive control experiment for the photoreaction
with a photo sensitizer of rose bengal (RB) did not indicate a significant
difference. The decreasing in the absorption spectra of EA was observed
upon an UV irradiation, which was different from that of Ox-EA due
to the different reaction intermediate with RB. The time-dependent
UV–vis spectra of EA upon UV-irradiation under RB (Figure S11).
