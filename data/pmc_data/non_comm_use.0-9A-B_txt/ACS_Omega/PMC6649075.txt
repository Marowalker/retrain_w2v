Currently, polyaniline (PANI) is
considered as a promising polymer
that can be used in biosensors, drug delivery systems, bioelectronics,
etc. Its biocompatibility can be strongly improved by using dopants
with biofunctionality. This study reveals the protonation/doping of
PANI by fluorinated analogs of natural amino acids, namely, α,α-difluoro-β-amino
acids (DFAAs) with alkyl and aromatic tails in N-methylpyrrolidone
solutions. We find that these acids can dope PANI due to both the
weakened basicity of their amino groups because of two fluorine atoms
in α,α-positions and specific intermolecular interactions
(π–π stacking, alkyl−π, F−π)
of their tails with units of PANI chains. These interactions did not
give the doped PANI salts with high conductivity but led to formation
of stable PANI-DFAA complexes, which were confirmed both by clear
changes in the UV–Vis and Fourier transform infrared spectra
of the protonated/doped PANI and by their conductivity of ∼10–6 S/cm. Our results suggest an applicability of such
PANI complexes as carriers of DFAA for their biomedical applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Although
biomedical applications of polyaniline (PANI)1,2 are
still in the shadow of other well-known high-tech ones (e.g.,
ref (3)), currently,
we can see a significant growth of publications on this important
issue of PANI-based materials (e.g., ref (4)). This increase in interest appeared not only
due to an encouraging set of PANI properties, namely, conductivity,
electrochemical activity, sensing and biosensing abilities, near-IR
absorption, ion-exchange capacity, high environmental stability and
low cost, etc.,5 but also due to recently
confirmed biocompatibility. The last PANI feature was first suggested
to have a good bio/histocompatibility with the rat tissue in vivo.6,7 But recently, it has been shown that extracts of PANI base and its
conducting (doped) salt PANI-HCl have excellent biocompatibility properties
in terms of skin irritation and sensitization.8 However, while both PANI extracts showed considerable cytotoxicity,
it was higher for PANI-HCl compared with PANI base. Nevertheless,
even the simple PANI purification via deprotonation/reprotonation
cycle allowed significant reduction in cytotoxicity. This fact, in
turn, evidenced a responsibility of low-molecular-weight impurities/by-products
rather than PANI for the observed cytotoxicity.9,10 The
finding agrees well with the fact that the toxicity effect of lowered
concentration of nanodiamond–PANI nanocomposite was shown to
be negligible.11 Therefore, one can consider
the redoping approach as a suitable method for preparation of biocompatible
conducting PANI. It is obvious that this approach can be enhanced
when using biologically active substances with acidic functionalities
as dopants. However, typically, these substances are weak acids and,
at quite high concentrations of >0.5 M (e.g., tartaric acids12) or even ≥5 M (e.g., pyroglutamic acid13), are unable to completely dope the dedoped
PANI dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), DMF,
or DMSO. Moreover, the optically active aminosulfonic acid containing
simultaneously acidic and amino functional groups appeared to be unable
to dope emeraldine base (EB) dissolved in NMP or DMF that was presumably
explained by formation of the zwitterion.12 Remarkably, however, while the impossibility of doping of weakly
basic EB by the zwitterionic form of phenylalanine was emphasized,14 it was found that the film of chiral dedoped
(after either (S)-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid or (R)-(−)-camphorsulfonic acid) PANI upon exposure to l-phenylalanine (or d-phenylalanine) solution for 3
weeks showed in circular dichroism (CD) spectra a new peak revealing
an interaction of both participants unlike the case of the enantiomer
with the opposite chirality (d-phenylalanine or l-phenylalanine, respectively).14,15 On the other hand,
the absence of the interaction in the opposite case suggests that
peaks induced by the respective enantiomer in the CD spectra appeared
probably not due to a specific protonation/doping in the system but
mainly to conformationally facilitated geometrical docking of the l-phenylalanine (or d-phenylalanine) to the chiral
dedoped PANI.

At the same time, the existence of amino acids
in zwitterionic
form cannot be the main reason of their inability to dope EB as the
protonated amino group contains quite labile H+ ion and
loses it (becomes deprotonated) at pH higher than the isoelectric
point of the amino acid.16 This lability
of the zwitterionic H+ means that it can be taken by substances,
which are stronger bases than amino group in the amino acid. However,
the NH2 group in amino acids (typical pKa values are roughly in the range of 9–1117) is much more basic than imine and amine groups
of EB (pKa values are 5.5 and 2.5, respectively18), and therefore, these groups are unable to
withdraw zwitterionic H+ only due to stronger donor–acceptor
bonding. Taking into account this aspect, we suggest considering EB
doping by amino acids, which contain amino groups with basicity weakened
due to introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents in the molecule.
To our best knowledge, our work is the first attempt to realize this
possibility by using fluorinated β-amino acids, namely, α,α-difluoro-β-amino
acids (DFAAs) as dopants. Although these amino acids are unnatural,
they are not only biocompatible but can be applied and even already
applied in biological research and in some synthetic pharmaceuticals19,20 due to enhanced biological interactions, increased proteolytic and
thermal stability, and biophysical attributes. Hopefully, these applications
can improve not only therapeutic properties through introduction of
electron-withdrawing fluorine containing substituents in the molecule20 but biocompatibility of polyaniline also.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
NMP
(Aldrich) was of UV–Vis
spectroscopy grade and used as received. In the doping experiments,
we used PANI in the EB state (PANIPOL).

DFAAs (Table 2) were synthesized in accordance
with the protocol described elsewhere.21 The short description of this protocol is given in the Supporting Information also.

2.2 PANI Doping with the Fluorinated Amino Acids
This process
was realized in 0.0125% (w/v) (∼0.0014 M) solutions
of EB in NMP upon slow addition of different quantities of DFAA powder
under constant stirring at ambient conditions to get 0.005, 0.01,
and 0.02 M concentrations of the acids. In particular, we used both
the stoichiometric molar ratio of the EB/DFAA = 1:0.5 and higher ones:
1:3.6, 1:7.2, and 1:14.4. The concentrations were doubled on the basis
of the UV–Vis monitoring as follows. Once the interaction at
the first molar ratio (e.g., 1:3.6 molar ratio, 0.005 M concentration
of DFAA) slowed down, the next double portion of the DFAA was added
to this solution to get a 1:7.2 molar ratio (0.01 M concentration
of DFAA). The same procedure was repeated for the next doubled molar
ratio 1:14.4 (0.02 M concentration of DFAA). This means that the last
UV–Vis spectrum of the joint solution with the previous molar
ratio of the EB/DFAA was followed by the first UV–Vis spectrum
of the joint solution with the next molar ratio and doubled DFAA concentration.

To check the possibility of PANI doping by DFAA in a water medium,
EB films were prepared by casting of 2% (w/v) EB solution in NMP on
quartz plates (0.8 cm × 3 cm) followed by their drying in ambient
conditions for 7 days to a solid state and then for 1 day in dynamic
vacuum at 60 °C to a constant weight. The dried film on the plate
was then placed in a 1 cm quartz cuvette filled with 0.01 M solution
of the DFAA (on the example of DFAA2) for subsequent monitoring of
the EB state by UV–Vis spectroscopy.

2.3 Characterization
pKa values of the synthesized DFAAs
and their unsubstituted
counterparts were calculated with the help of the Calculator Plugin
within the Marvin software package22 (Table 1). Interactions of
these acids with EB in joint solutions in NMP, placed in a 1 cm quartz
cuvette, were monitored by UV–Vis spectrophotometer Specord
M40 for up to 17 days. Similarly, we studied a possibility of interaction
of EB films on quartz plate with water solutions of the acids in a
1 cm quartz cuvette.

Table 1 pKa of
the α,α-Difluoro-β-amino acids and Their Non-α,α-Fluorinated
Analogs Calculated with the Help of the Marvin Software Package22
The samples of PANIs doped with a stoichiometric molar
ratio of
the EB unit/acid = 1:0.5 by the aromatic DFAAs, which demonstrated
the strongest interaction with EB (DFAA2, DFAA3, and DFAA4), were
separated from their solutions as follows. At first stage, the solutions
were concentrated while blowing an argon stream. These concentrated
solutions were cast on glass plates and dried at ambient conditions
and then at 60 °C until constant weight was achieved. The formed
doped PANIs films were scraped off the glass plates and ground in
an agate mortar to a fine powdery state. These powders were used for
conductivity and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements.
In particular, there were prepared small pellets of the pure doped
PANIs to measure their DC conductivity by standard two-probe technique.
This simple technique was used as the conductivities of these doped
PANIs were quite low (see Section 3.3). The powders were also used to prepare their pellets
with KBr for FTIR measurements (Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer).

3 Results
The calculated pKa values of carboxylic
and amine groups of all the synthesized DFAAs reveal their stronger
acidic and weaker basic properties compared to their unsubstituted
counterparts (Table 1). This effect is predictable and appears due to the high electronegativity
of fluorine.20 Nevertheless, the pKa2 values are still too high compared to those
of imino and amino groups of PANI (5.5 and 2.5, respectively18). Obviously, this means that the amino groups
of DFAAs are very strong bases and dedoped PANI (EB) is unable to
take off protons from their zwitterions. Therefore, at first view,
PANI cannot be doped in their solutions. Indeed, we could not register
the PANI doping in the amino acid solutions in NMP at the stoichiometric
molar ratio of EB/DFAA = 1:0.5 or even at 2–3-fold surplus
of the amino acids for a long time (up to 1 month). Nevertheless,
at lower ratios (3.6–14.4-fold surplus of the amino acids),
the PANI doping became possible even in the case of DFAA1 having the
most weak base and acid functionalities with highest pKa among the synthesized DFAAs (Table 1).

3.1 PANI Doping with the Aliphatic
Fluorinated
Amino Acid
As one can see in Figure 1a, there are an almost negligible decrease
in the exciton band of EB at 641 nm and an increase of absorption
in the near-infrared region (above ∼750 nm) of the UV–Vis
spectra scanned for 23 h in the joint solution of EB and DFAA1 at
the 1:3.6 molar ratio. Nevertheless, even these very weak changes
reveal some interaction of EB with DFAA1.

Figure 1 In situ UV–Vis
spectra of the 0.0125 wt % (∼0.0014
M) EB solution containing different concentrations of DFAA1 monitored
(a, b) during 23–24 h and (c) up to 15 days: (a) 0.005 M DFAA1
(EB/DFAA1 = 1:3.6 molar ratio); (b) 0.01 M DFAA1 (EB/DFAA1 = 1:7.2
molar ratio); (c) 0.02 M DFAA1(EB/DFAA1 = 1:14.4 molar ratio).

A double increase of the amino
acid concentration (EB/DFAA1 = 1:7.2
molar ratio) causes a small enhancement of changes in both the exciton
band height and near-infrared absorption as well as a small red shift
(∼2 nm) of the band maximum for 24 h (Figure 1b and Table 2). Moreover, at around
710 nm, a quite clear isosbestic point appears, which indicates the
EB direct protonation by DFAA1.23 As expected,
these changes were enhanced at another doubled DFAA1 concentration
(molar ratio of EB/DFAA1 = 1:14.4) that led to the stronger red shift
(∼5 nm) for 6 h (Figure 1c). Moreover, prolongation of the interaction time up to 1–2
weeks caused strong changes in the joint EB and DFAA1 solution. In
particular, the exciton band significantly dropped and shifted to
∼700 nm at the 15th day with simultaneous appearance of shoulder
at ∼780 nm (Figure 1c). These changes are accompanied with some dropping of the
band intensity probably due to formation of a small quantity of an
insoluble phase that, in total, confirms PANI doping with DFAA1.

3.2 PANI Doping with the Aromatic Fluorinated
Amino Acids
Replacement of the alkyl (octyl) tail in DFAA1
by the unsubstituted phenyl one in DFAA2 led to a quite dramatic decrease
in pKa1 and pKa2 of these amino acids (Table 1). This change indicates a significant enhancement of the
acidity and weakening of the basicity of the carboxyl and amino groups,
respectively, under the effect of the aromatic substituent. Moreover,
introducing additional electronegative substituents (with different
inductive and mesomeric effects) in the para position of the benzene
ring of the amino acids caused the further acidity enhancement from
pKa1 = 2.56 (DFAA2) to pKa1 = 1.88 (DFAA4), while the basicities of the amino groups
were almost the same. Nevertheless, despite these strong changes in
acid–base properties of the acids and increase in their acidity
in the series of DFAA2 < DFAA3 < DFAA4 at their lowest concentration
of 0.005 M (i.e., at EB/DFAA = 1:3.6 molar ratio), a red shift of
the maximum of the EB exciton band is not observed (Table 2). At the same time, as in the
above case of the aliphatic DFAA1, one can see a very small decrease
of this band and a weak increase of absorption in the near-infrared
region of the in situ UV–Vis spectra of the solutions of EB
and the aromatic DFAAs monitored during the first day (Table 2 and Figures 2a–5a).

of 0.0125
wt % (∼0.0014 M) EB and different concentrations of DFAA2 monitored
during up to 10 days: (a) 0.005 M DFAA2 (EB/DFAA1 = 1:3.6 molar ratio);
(b) 0.01 M DFAA2 (EB/DFAA2 = 1:7.2 molar ratio); (c) 0.02 M DFAA2
(EB/DFAA2 = 1:14.4 molar ratio).

wt % (∼0.0014 M) EB and different concentrations of DFAA3:
(a) 0.005 M DFAA3 (EB/DFAA3 = 1:3.6 molar ratio); (b) 0.01 M DFAA3
(EB/DFAA3 = 1:7.2 molar ratio); (c) 0.02 M DFAA3 (EB/DFAA3 = 1:14.4
molar ratio).

Figure 5 In situ UV–Vis
spectra of the solutions of 0.0125 wt % (∼0.0014
M) EB with different concentrations of DFAA4 monitored during 24 h:
(a) 0.005 M DFAA4 (EB/DFAA4 = 1:3.6 molar ratio); (b) 0.01 M DFAA4
(EB/DFAA4 = 1:7.2); (c) 0.02 M DFAA4 (EB/DFAA4 = 1:14.4).

A clear difference in the doping ability of all
the synthesized
DFAAs appeared at their higher concentrations or long-term interactions
(a few days) (Table 2 and Figures 1–5).

Thus, even the weakest aromatic amino acid
DFAA2 with an unsubstituted
benzene ring at 0.01 M concentration (EB/DFAA2 = 1:7.2 molar ratio)
shows much faster interaction with EB compared to the aliphatic one
DFAA1 (compare Figures 1b and 2b; see Table 2). Furthermore, the isosbestic point in the
DFAA2 case red-shifted to ∼730 nm, which indicated probably
an involvement of additional interactions of PANI with this acid.
Moreover, the interaction is so fast that, for 1440 min, one can see
a quite strong shift to 668 nm and decrease in the exciton band maximum
compared with the first (3 min) UV–Vis spectrum registered
just after the addition of the next DFAA2 portion to the solution
(Figure 2b and Table 2). The rate and degree
of the PANI doping (position of the exciton band maximum) increased
at the next doubled DFAA2 concentration of 0.02 M (EB/DFAA2 = 1:14.4
molar ratio) that was accompanied also by a quite strong red shift
of the exciton band maximum up to 714 nm at 1440 min of the interaction
(Figures 2c and 3 and Table 2).

Interestingly, unlike the aliphatic amino acid DFAA1,
the interaction
of the unsubstituted aromatic amino acid DFAA2 with EB was practically
completed at the first day (1440 min) and resulted in the exciton
band position at 714 nm, which did not change even for 10 days (14,400
min) (Figure 3). As
in the former case, these spectral features were accompanied with
some dropping of the band intensity probably due to formation of a
small quantity of an insoluble phase of PANI doped by DFAA2.

The substitution in the para position of the benzene ring of DFAA
by electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine atom (DFAA3)
and especially as the trifluoromethyl group (DFAA4) dramatically enhances
interaction of these amino acids with EB (Figures 3–5).

In particular, at the highest DFAA3 and DFAA4 concentration (0.02
M), the interaction with EB becomes saturated at the fifth day with
the final positions of the exciton band at 731 and 754 nm, respectively
(Table 2 and Figure 3). This result indicates
that, in both cases, the interaction runs slower but deeper with the
higher EB exciton band red shifts than in the case of DFAA2. Moreover,
a degree of this interaction increases with increasing electronegativity
of the p-substituent (i.e., from F to CF3) in the benzene
ring. However, at lower concentrations of 0.005 and 0.01 M, the rate
of the acid dopant interaction with EB is lower in the case DFAA4
compared with DFAA2 and DFAA3. Thus, at these concentrations, one
can observe mainly a quite strong decrease in the exciton band maximum
practically without its red shift during the first day of the interaction
of DFAA4 with EB (Table 2 and Figure 5a,b).

In general, the UV–Vis spectral measurements testify to
some dissimilarity in the doping behavior of the aliphatic and aromatic
fluorinated amino acids as well as to a delayed interaction of the
former with the dissolved EB compared with the latter (see slopes
of kinetic profiles of the interactions at the highest DFAA concentration
in Figure 3). Considering
the same functionalities of these DFAA and differences in their hydrocarbon
tails, one may assume that both similarity and dissimilarity in their
behavior can be associated with specific interactions of these tails
with EB macromolecules and NMP molecules. It should be emphasized
here that this assumption ignores a gradual increase in their acidity
and a decrease in basicity from aliphatic amino acid DFAA1 to aromatic
amino acids DFAAs (Table 1). But we take into account, in this case, the critically
important fact that the amino group of these acids is still much a
stronger base than imino and amino groups of EB (Table 1 and above discussion) and,
therefore, inevitably binds the carboxylic group hydrogen with formation
of the zwitterion.

3.3 Properties of the PANI
Doped with the Aromatic
Fluorinated Amino Acids
The above UV–Vis spectroscopy
evidences of the binding affinity of PANI for DFAA are strongly supported
with studies of FTIR spectra and conductivity of the formed PANI salts/complexes.
In particular, we confirmed the PANI doping phenomenon on the example
of the PANIs doped by the aromatic amino acids DFAA2–DFAA4)
with the stoichiometric molar ratio of the EB unit to the DFAA (1:0.51). These amino acids manifested the most significant
changes in their above-discussed UV–Vis spectra (see Figures 2, 4, and 5). As one can see in Figure 6 and Table 3, albeit most of bands of the
EB and the amino acids overlap due to differences in the acids’
FTIR spectra and their inputs in the spectra of the doped PANIs, a
few changes in positions and shapes of some characteristic PANI bands
can be revealed.

In particular, there is
the band overlapping of asymmetrical (asym)
NH3+ deformation vibration and asym COO– stretching vibration of the amino acids with quinonoid
ring stretching vibration of the pristine EB (in the range of about
1550–1600 cm–1). Nevertheless, their changes
are clearly identified in the doped PANIs despite the presence of
the wide band of C=O stretching vibration in NMP at 1665(6)
cm–1 (Figure 6 and Figure S1). Thus, one can
see in all cases a blue shift of the asym NH3+ vibration (Table 3) that suggests at least a partial transfer of protons from the protonated
amino groups of the amino acids to PANI imine sites. This suggestion
is supported with the red shift of the quinonoid ring stretching vibrations
typical of PANI doping27,29 (from 1583 to 1573/1572/1562
cm–1 in cases of DFAA2/DFAA3/DFAA4, respectively; Table 3). These new positions
of quinonoid ring stretching vibrations are quite close to asym COO– stretching vibrations of the amino acids (1569/1570/1578
cm–1; Table 3). At first view, we cannot resolve these vibrations especially
for asym COO– stretching vibrations of DFAA2 and
DFAA3 (Figure 6a,b),
which are located at a little lower wavenumbers (1569/1570 cm–1) than those of the PANI-DFAA2 and PANI-DFAA3 salts
(1573/1572 cm–1). At the same time, the symmetrical
(sym) COO– stretching vibrations of the amino acids
shifted after their interaction with PANI to lower wavenumbers (from
1416/1415/1416 to 1414/1410/1406 cm–1) (Table 3). Comparison of this
red shift of the sym COO– stretching vibrations
with positions of the asym COO– stretching vibrations
allows us to assume that bands at 1573/1572/1562 cm–1 may be assigned to the new positions of quinonoid ring stretching
vibrations in the doped PANIs. This assignment agrees well with a
red shift of the C–N stretching vibrations from 1304 to 1299/1301/1303
cm–1 in aromatic amine structures (Table 3) typical of PANI protonation
(doping).29

Unexpectedly, unlike
the quinonoid ring stretching vibrations,
the benzenoid ring stretching vibrations of the parent EB blue-shifted
from 1495 to 1502/1509/1504 cm–1(Table 3, Figure 6, and Figure S1) after its interaction with these DFAAs. This phenomenon both differs
from the typical doping behavior of PANI27,29 and confirms the above-described specificity of interaction of the
fluorinated amino acids with EB.

The specificity of this interaction
is also confirmed by the quite
low conductivity of the PANI doped with these acids (Table 4), which is, however, much higher
than that of the parent EB (∼10–10 S/cm).

Interestingly,
in the case of DFAA2 with an unsubstituted benzene
ring, the conductivity value is around by 2.5–3.6 times higher
than in the DFAA3 and DFAA4 cases. This fact agrees with the highest
red shift (to 1299 cm–1, Table 3) of C–N stretching vibration in protonated
secondary aromatic amine structures of PANI-DFAA2. The differences
in the red shifts of C–N stretching vibrations and in the conductivity
values of the doped PANIs (Table 4), although small, are opposite and, therefore, contradict
to the more significant doping degree in the DFAA3 and DFAA4 cases
(Figures 2–5). Such a contradiction probably can be explained
by the fact that conductivity of the doped PANI in the solid state
depends not only on the doping degree but also on packing of the charged
PANI macromolecules, which is affected, in turn, by space orientation
and plasticization ability of the dopant anions.

Judging by
small changes of optical band gaps of the PANI-DFAA
complexes (Table 4),
which decrease in the series 1  the packing factor is not important in their
diluted solutions. This series, unlike the conductivity changes in
these complexes, matches with changes in the exciton band position
of the PANI (EB) under the interaction with DFAAs (Figure 3) and, therefore, confirms
enhancement of this interaction the from DFAA1 case to DFAA4 one.

4 Discussion
The above results clearly reveal
the interaction/protonation/doping
of EB with the synthesized DFAAs in the joint solutions in NMP. Nevertheless,
taking into account much lower basicity of imino and amino groups
of EB (pKa = 5.5 and 2.5, respectively18) compared with that of amino groups of DFAAs
(pKa2 approximately in the range of 7.25–7.99, Table 1), it is difficult
to understand the existence of this interaction unless additional
facilitating factors are considered. In particular, the most important
factor here is probably a competition of imine nitrogen atoms of EB,
amino groups of the acid(s), and carbonyl groups of NMP molecules
for carboxylic hydrogens of these amino acids. Naturally, there are
also other important additional physicochemical factors affecting
the participants. Specifically, this competition begins only after
addition of the acid in the EB solution, where EB macromolecules have
already been involved in hydrogen bonding with carbonyl groups of
NMP molecules through mutual hydrogen bonds30,31 and obviously are both in coiled and agglomerated conformations.32,33 The addition of the fluorinated amino acid inevitably changes the
physicochemical situation in this solution due to the following factors:
(1) an involvement of NMP molecules both from the solution bulk and
from the solvation shells of the EB macromolecules into formation
of the solvation shells of the amino acid molecules (or their zwitterions)
(Figure 7). This change,
in turn, is accompanied with a partial weakening of the proton interaction
with the amino group of the zwitterion due to its involvement in hydrogen
bonding with the carbonyl group of the NMP molecule.

Figure 7 Scheme of hydrogen bonding
interactions of EB and DFAA with NMP.

This important input of NMP in the PANI doping by DFAAs in
the
NMP solutions is strongly supported by the fact that we have found
no changes in the UV–Vis spectrum of EB film placed in 0.01
M water solution of DFAA2 for a long time (up to 17 days, Figure S2). (2) The factor (1) facilitates protonation
of imine nitrogen atoms in the PANI macromolecules by the amino acid
(or more probably by its zwitterion) that is accompanied with both
an appearance of positive charges on their chains and a transition
from their quite compact coil conformation to a more expanded one.34,35 These changes are accompanied by red shifts of the exciton band
and appearance of absorption in the near-infrared range of the UV–Vis
spectra of the joint EB-DFAA solutions (Figures 1–5). (3) Specific
interactions of DFAAs occur both with EB and NMP molecules not only
due to the protonating and hydrogen bonding abilities of carboxylic
and amino groups and fluorine36,37 but also due to other
noncovalent interactions involving fluorine atoms38 and aliphatic or aromatic tails of DFAAs with benzenoid/quinonoid
units of EB.34,39 In particular, the fluorine atoms
both near the amino group (all DFAAs) and in the aromatic tails (DFAA3
and DFAA4) can be involved in interactions with NH groups38 of the PANI chains as well as in F−π
interactions with electron-deficient quinonoid rings similarly to
interactions with electron-poor aromatic surfaces.40 The enhancement of the PANI doping by the aromatic DFAAs
compared with the aliphatic DFAA1 in the course of long-term interactions
can be better understood if we postulate noncovalent π–π
stacking interactions of the aromatic tails of the amino acid molecules
with benzenoid rings or quinonoid rings tied with protonated imine
nitrogen atoms of the same EB macromolecule.

Naturally, all
these changes in the solution after addition of
the amino acid need some time to be completed, which obviously depends
on its structure. This suggestion agrees with a more effective long-term
interaction of the aromatic DFAAs with EB compared to the aliphatic
DFAA1 case (Figure 3 and Table 2). In
particular, for the aromatic DFAAs, we finally observed both the stronger
red shift (up to 758 nm for 5 days) and the more significant decrease
in the exciton band as well as the higher growth of the absorption
in the near-infrared part of the spectrum (Figures 2c, 3, and 4c–5c and Table 2). For the aliphatic
DFAA1, the shift was much smaller (up to 683 nm for 10 days, Figures 1c and 3 and Table 2). The same interactions with neighboring EB macromolecules should
be taken into account also.

Despite a small binding energy in
the PANI-DFAA complexes due to
the mutual interaction sites, the residence time of the amino acids
near the imine nitrogen atoms increases that facilitates the PANI
protonation process. The probability of these interactions increases
in the case of high amino acid concentrations, which are supported
with the registered spectral changes in the joint solutions with increasing
DFAA concentrations from 0.005 to 0.02 M.

If the π–π
stacking interaction postulate is
correct, then the PANI protonation behavior should depend also on
electron density on the DFAA aromatic tail, differing only by substituents
in the p-position of the benzene ring (Table 1). It should be emphasized here, however,
that despite this important p-substituent effect, the electron density
on the tail is additionally decreased by two fluorine atoms in the
α,α-position to the carboxylic group of aromatic DFAA.

Let us consider, for example, the highest acid concentration of
0.02 M causing the most significant changes in the PANI spectra during
long-term interactions (Figures 2–5 and Table 2). In that case, the doping
acids (including DFAA1) can be arranged in the next series, which
is based on the final position of the exciton band of the doped PANI 2  

As
one can see, the most significant shift of the exciton band
is observed for DFAA4 having the most electron deficient aromatic
ring due to p-substituent CF3 with a very strong electron-withdrawing
ability. The shift is much more moderate in the case of the p-substituent
F (DFAA3) causing the significantly less electron deficient aromatic
ring. This shift decreases again when transition to the unsubstituted
aromatic tail (DFAA2) having only a weak electron deficiency induced
by two α,α-fluorine atoms separated from benzene ring
by two σ-bonds (see structure of DFAA2 in Table 1). Finally, the shift is the lowest one in
the case of aliphatic DFAA1.

The strong difference in the doping
ability between the aromatic
and aliphatic DFAAs is revealed also by various positions of the isosbestic
point on the right side of the exciton band in the UV–Vis spectra
(Figures 1, 2, 4, and 5). In particular, the amino acids with benzene rings have
this isosbestic point at around 730 nm, while DFAA1 with the alkyl
tail has it at around 710 nm. These differences can be probably assigned
to specific doping states of PANI, which, in accordance with the above
postulate, stem from various interactions of DFAA with PANI. Indeed,
if π–π stacking interactions of the benzene rings
of PANI are more probable with electron-deficient tails of DFAA2,
DFAA3, and DFAA4 (Figure 8a), then the more electronegative p-substituent is in the
benzene ring, the stronger is the red shift of the exciton band. The
shift is probably further strengthened by F−π interactions
(Figure 8a). This suggestion
is supported with positions of these amino acids in the above series
(2). Moreover, even in the case of weaker alkyl−π interactions,41 the aliphatic DFAA1 tail can also facilitate
its immobilization near both the benzenoid rings (Figure 8b) and even electron-deficient
quinonoid rings of PANI.42

Figure 8 Scheme of PANI doping
by DFAA with (a) electron-deficient aromatic
and (b) alkyl DFAA1 tails.

One more highly interesting feature of the discussed interactions
of all DFAAs with EB is an absence of one of characteristic polaron
bands around 430 nm even in the case of the most effective dopant
DFAA4 (Figures 1, 2, 4, and 5). This phenomenon means probably that the interaction does
not lead to appearance of polaron structures along PANI protonated
chains typically characterized in the UV–Vis spectra by two
bands at around 430 nm (∼3 eV) and 800 nm (∼1.5 eV).43,44 Such behavior strongly differs from the well-known PANI doping by
acids, which protonate both imine nitrogen atoms in the EB quinonoid
units with formation of dications (bipolarons), followed by their
intramolecular redox transformation into radical cations (polarons).45 At this stage, it is difficult to explain completely
the found difference between the case under investigation and the
typical ones without theoretical modeling of the PANI doping by DFAA,
which deserves a separate study. Nevertheless, on the basis of the
highly probable additional interactions of the DFAAs tails with PANI
chains (see above discussion), we can consider two possibilities for
the beginning. The first one is the immobilization of the charge-compensating
anions of the amino acids due to such interactions near the protonated
imine nitrogen atoms that hinder their redistribution and, therefore,
suppress the internal redox transformation along the charged PANI
chains. The next possibility can be a preferential protonation of
one imine nitrogen in the quinonoid structures and formation of their
cations, while the second one is not protonated probably because of
an effect of Coulomb repulsion of protons by the positively charged
protonated sites.

5 Conclusions
The
main result of this study consists of the confirmed protonation/doping
of PANI by representatives of amino acids, namely, by the α,α-difluoro-β-amino
acids (DFAAs) in NMP solutions. We realized this possibility through
weakening of the basicity of the DFAA amino groups due to the introduction
of the electron-withdrawing substituents. On the basis of the comparison
of the UV–Vis spectroscopy data and structures of the synthesized
DFAAs and PANIs, we deduce that this protonation/doping process is
facilitated by specific interactions (π–π stacking,
alkyl-π, F-π) of DFAAs tails with the units of PANI (EB)
macromolecules. This process gets saturated for the long time that
depends on electron deficiency of the DFAAs tails and ends probably
with the protonation of only one imine nitrogen of the quinonoid PANI
unit.

Although the interactions of EB and DFAAs are not strong
enough
to form typical doped PANIs with high conductivity, the formation
of PANI-DFAA complexes is confirmed not only by changes in the UV–Vis
and FTIR spectra but also by their conductivity with convincing value
of ∼10–6 S/cm. Existence of such complexes
opens their applicability as carriers of DFAAs for biomedical applications.

Finally, the observed influence of the aliphatic and electron deficient
aromatic tails of DFAAs on the PANI protonation/doping process suggests
that similar π–π stacking, alkyl−π,
and other kinds of intermolecular interactions can proceed also in
the case of typical PANI doping by other organic or even inorganic
acids except the simplest ones (e.g., HCl).

1 It should be emphasized
here that
we could apply this high ratio despite the above shown fact that,
in the used diluted solutions (0.0125 wt % (∼0.0014 M), EB
could be doped only at much lower ratios (EB unit/amino acid ≤
1:3.6). The formation of the respective doped PANI salts/complexes
at this high ratio became possible probably due to concentration and
drying of the joint PANI–amino acid solutions that resulted
in the dry salts/complexes.
