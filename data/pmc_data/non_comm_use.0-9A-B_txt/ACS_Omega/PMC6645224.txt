The hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) is one of the two processes
in electrolytic water splitting. Known for more than two centuries,
the HER still receives great attention in fundamental and applied
science in view of its apparent simplicity (only two electrons are
transferred), fast kinetics in acidic media, and promising technological
applications in electrolyzers. However, the exact nature of active
catalytic sites for this reaction is often uncertain, especially at
nonuniform metal electrodes. Identification of such centers is important,
as the HER will probably be central in future energy provision schemes,
and it is simultaneously a convenient model reaction to study structure–composition–activity
relations in catalysis. In this work, using simple coordination–activity
considerations, we outline the location and geometric configuration
of the active sites at various model Pt single-crystal electrodes.
We show that when the coordination of such surface sites is optimized
and their density at the surface is maximized, the experimental-specific
HER activities are among the highest reported in the literature for
pure platinum with a well-defined surface structure under similar
conditions.

Introduction
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
is not only one of the pillars
of the so-called “hydrogen economy”1,2 but
also one of the fastest reactions in electrocatalysis.3 However, relevant modern devices which make use of it,
such as polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers, require significant
loadings of costly Pt catalysts on the cathodes to achieve reasonable
efficiencies. The loadings can be reduced if the most active sites
are first identified and then maximized on the catalysts by suitable
synthesis methods. However, the nature of the active catalytic sites
for the HER on Pt is still under debate. In this communication, we
demonstrate that simple coordination–activity relations can
shed light on the nature of the most active catalytic centers on various
model stepped surfaces of pure Pt in acidic media. We show that increasing
the density of those sites grants high activities without any need
for alloying or other modifications with foreign metals. In addition,
we explain some typical trends experimentally observable in HER electrocatalysis
at Pt surfaces in acidic media.

We start our analysis assuming
that during the HER only adsorbed
hydrogen species (*H) play a dominant role. Besides, following the
approach of Nørskov et al.,4,5 we do not consider any
prevailing mechanism for this reaction: as a first approximation,
we only consider the binding energy of hydrogen at a specific catalytic
site as a descriptor and neglect, for instance, the surface diffusion
of adsorbed hydrogen species during the reaction, which is necessary
for the so-called Tafel step. In this order of ideas, a simplified
“roadmap” to reach the HER activity maximum is shown
in Figure 1. The figure
links the trends in the measured HER activities (y-axis) with the *H binding energies for pure metals (x-axis) assessed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.6 Although the exact value of the activity optimum
likely depends on the surface coverage of hydrogen,6 in general lines, it can be concluded that the optimal
active sites should bind *H intermediates slightly more weakly (∼0.1
eV) than Pt(111).7 Koper has shown8 that in most cases ΔGH is sufficient to model the HER and make useful predictions
of new materials. The advantages of this thermodynamic approach are
that it avoids transition-state calculations and does not require
knowledge on whether the reaction mechanism is Volmer–Tafel
or Volmer–Heyrovsky, paramount to make affordable computational
models because the two mechanisms might be operative under HER conditions
on Pt.9 Note, however, that Figure 1 gives a trend and provides
an adsorption-energy condition for the optimal HER catalyst but does
not provide any additional information on how to actually design enhanced
active sites.

Figure 1 “Volcano” plot correlating the experimentally
measured
HER activities for the closely packed metal surfaces and the calculated
binding energies of *H, according to ref (6). The optimal catalytic sites should bind the
*H intermediates ∼0.1 eV more weakly than Pt(111).

Model Pt(111) is a rather active surface for the
HER, but there
are affordable ways to increase its activity. For example, the activity
can be increased by alloying Pt with other (mainly transition) metals
or by positioning monolayer amounts of those metals on the surface.10−13 Another approach would be to optimize the active catalytic centers
by introducing certain defects, which can be, for instance, identified
using the so-called generalized coordination numbers ().14 In simple
terms,  is a weighted average (see the Experimental Section) of the conventional coordination
numbers that links adsorption energies of the intermediate to the
geometric environment of the active sites where they adsorb.15 Consequently, general information about the
geometry of the sites can be obtained if activity plots are made based
on . In this context, coordination–activity
plots provide a means to connect two of the pillars of modern heterogeneous
catalysis, namely, the Sabatier principle (optimality is found when
adsorption and desorption processes are equally fast) and the Taylor
hypothesis of active centers.16 While the
connection between HER activity and hydrogen binding strength through
the Sabatier principle is well-accepted,5,6,9,30 the systematic connection
between the HER activity and surface morphology is much less common.
This is probably because most of the theoretical approaches in catalysis17 are based on energetic descriptors, namely,
adsorption energies, band centers, work functions, and so forth, which
do not contain any structural information per se. In this work, we
identify the geometric nature and location of the most probable HER
active sites at some model Pt electrodes and, based on that, experimentally
demonstrate one of the highest HER activities for pure platinum well-defined
surfaces reported in the literature under similar conditions.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 2A displays
the coordination–activity plot for a series of sites at Pt
surfaces, namely, Pt(hkl) surfaces and Pt adatoms
located on Pt(111). In the following, Pt(hkl) is
also represented as Pt[n(h1k1l1) ×
(h2k2l2)]. In this notation, (h1k1l1) is the terrace type, n is the atomic length of
such terrace, and (h2k2l2) are the step types that
separate consecutive terraces. Note that only the threefold hollow
sites and the bridge sites are considered here as the most probable
active centers (see examples in Figure 2B–F) because *H does not occupy “on-top”
positions at low and moderate coverages, according to DFT calculations
(see, e.g., ref (7).)

Figure 2 (A) Coordination–activity plot linking the geometry (in
terms of generalized coordination numbers) and the HER activity of
various Pt catalytic centers. SE and SB designate the step edge and
bottom, respectively, and AD denotes adatoms on the surface of Pt(111).
Inset: correlation between differential adsorption energies with respect
to Pt(111) and generalized coordination numbers. The gray zone corresponds
to ±0.05 eV around the linear fit, which is the maximum absolute
error. The corresponding error propagation is shown in gray in the
main panel as well. (B–F) H* adsorption configurations for
the sites in (A).

In particular, the inset
in Figure 2A demonstrates
how the *H adsorption energies change
with the generalized coordination number at different sites on various
Pt surfaces compared to Pt(111), as indicated in the plot by ΔΔGH. For comparison, note that the face-centered
cubic (fcc)-threefold hollow sites on Pt(111) have the generalized
coordination number 6.95 (Figure 2B), hexagonal close-packed (hcp)-threefold hollow sites—7.5,
whereas the optimal sites are predicted to have a generalized coordination
number 7.7.

The above-mentioned optimal Pt sites can be constructed
without
any introduction of atoms of foreign metals. Probably, the most straightforward
way is to introduce concave Pt defects, as shown in Figure 2, in which the most active
sites are always located at the bottom of the steps. Taking the case
of Pt(331), which can also be denoted by Pt[3(111) × (111)],
where n = 3 is the atomic width of the terraces.
For instance, the bridge sites at the step bottoms (Figure 2C right) have a generalized
coordination number 7.33, which is closer to the optimum (7.7) in
terms of *H binding energies compared to pure Pt(111). Sites with
larger coordination, such as the step bottoms of Pt(553) (the generalized
coordination of which is identical to those at the step bottoms in
Pt(221) and Pt(775), the only difference being the terrace length)
should also enhance the HER activity with respect to Pt(111).

By contrast, the undercoordinated bridge sites at the step edges
schematically shown in Figure 2C (left) have low generalized coordination numbers (5.44)
and consequently bind *H too strongly to consider them as active centers
(see Figures 1 and 2A). Lowering the generalized coordination numbers
even further (e.g., by having adatoms of Pt on Pt(111), nAD@Pt(111)) in Figure 2A, with n = 2, 3 (see the *H adsorption sites in Figure 2D–F) should
not enhance the activity either.

Regarding the accuracy of the
analysis in Figure 2A, note that the maximum/mean absolute errors
(MAX and MAE) in the correlation between ΔGH and  are as low as 0.05/0.02 eV. Such small
errors make it fair to attribute activity differences to sites for
which ΔGH differs by ∼0.10
eV. As all calculations were made only for Pt, using the same calculation
settings and proportional k-point samplings according
to the cell size, most DFT-associated errors should cancel out when
subtracting adsorption energies, which justifies the choice of ΔΔGH in Figure 2A (i.e., the differential hydrogen adsorption energy
vs Pt(111)). Figure 2A includes error bars as well, showing the error propagation from
correlations between ΔGH and  to log i0.

With
the computational predictions in mind, we carried out HER
experiments with various stepped Pt[n(111) ×
(111)] single-crystal surfaces, namely, Pt(331), Pt(221), and Pt(775).
These have 111-like steps and (111) terraces, which are 3-, 4-, and
7-atom wide (in other words, n = 3, 4, and 7 in Pt[n(111) × (111)]). We excluded the experiments on Pt(110)
(n = 2) in this case, as it reconstructs in a missing-row
fashion during electrochemical experiments, resulting in longer terraces
than expected.18−21 Conversely, Pt(331) (n = 3) has been shown to be
stable against surface reconstruction.22

To confirm the quality of Pt(hkl) electrodes,
cyclic voltammograms were taken in Ar-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolytes. Figure 3A shows cyclic voltammograms of the investigated surfaces within
the electrode potential areas of their electrochemical “fingerprints”.23

Figure 3 (A) Cyclic voltammograms of various Pt(hkl) electrodes
in an Ar-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 at dU/dt = 50 mV/s. (B) Integrated cathodic currents (background
corrected) in the potential regions indicated in (A). The dotted line
in (B) marks the point where half of the maximal *H coverage is reached
on Pt(111).

In Figure 3A, all
of the surfaces exhibit the typical voltammetric behavior of stepped
Pt single crystals in 0.1 M HClO4, revealing different
characteristic features in the so-called hydrogen underpotential deposition
(H-UPD) region (between ∼0.4 and 0.1 V) and the OH adsorption
region (more positive than ∼0.5 V) and confirming the quality
of the electrode surfaces.

Figure 3B shows
the integrated cathodic parts of the voltammograms in the H-UPD region.
Owing to the availability of different adsorption sites,23 their number is greater than that of Pt(111)
by ∼14% for Pt(221), by ∼28% for Pt(331), and by ∼45%
for Pt(775). It should also be emphasized here that the sharp features
in the hydrogen UPD region, responsible for such an increase, are
due to *H/*OH replacement at step edges and similar undercoordinated
sites.24 Thus, in the cathodic scan, all
*OH species are likely replaced by *H. The importance of these differences
will be emphasized later on.

Another important aspect of the
*H adsorption at different Pt[n(111) × (111)]
surfaces is that the isotherms are
shifted (Figure 3B)
toward more negative potentials compared to Pt(111). If one selects
a reference point where the adsorbate coverage is half of the maximal
for Pt(111),3,25 the differences between the isotherms
at this point reflect the average differences in the adsorbate binding
energies.26 The shift is ∼0.04 V
for Pt[3(111) × (111)], it is maximal (∼0.06 V) for Pt[4(111)
× (111)], and it decreases down to ∼0.02 V for Pt[7(111)
× (111)], in agreement with the general trends and models presented
in Figure 2.

Notably, Pt(221) demonstrates an average shift (∼0.06 V)
in the binding potential that is very close to the optimum (∼0.09
V). However, note that the experimental isotherms represent not only
the contribution of the optimal catalytic sites but also terrace sites
with binding energies close to those of Pt(111). Summarizing, Figure 3B reveals the existence
of a significant number of adsorption sites at Pt[n(111) × (111)] electrodes that bind *H more weakly than Pt(111)
and should be, therefore, more active toward the HER in accordance
with the theoretical expectations described in Figure 2.

We complement these observations
with Figure 4, which
contains the activity of Pt(111)
and stepped Pt[n(111) × (111)] electrodes toward
the HER in an Ar-saturated HClO4, under the hanging meniscus
configuration. We selected this simplified protocol to ensure the
minimal influence of undesired experimental factors27 and to be able to compare the results to the literature,
where reports of the activity trends for the state-of-the-art materials
in H2-free electrolytes are abundant (see, e.g., refs (28)–2930). Moreover, the results are not corrected for
the iR-drop to avoid additional errors in this particular
case and to be able to compare the model surfaces under exactly the
same conditions.28 Thus, rather than operating
with the real exchange current densities, which are extremely difficult
to measure in acidic media,4 we compare
the activities at the reference points under exactly the same conditions
and cell geometries. Cu–Pt(111) near-surface alloy (NSA) was
used as an intrinsic probe to additionally benchmark the activities
against a highly HER-active surface under similar conditions.3

Figure 4 (A) Typical cathodic branches of voltammograms comparing
the HER
activity of Pt[n(111) × (111)] electrodes in
an Ar-saturated 0.1 M HClO4. CuPt(111)-NSA stands for the
NSAs reported in ref (3). (B) Activity of the Pt[n(111) × (111)]surfaces
at −0.036 V vs RHE. (C) Same activities as in (B) but corrected
by the different number of adsorption sites as revealed by the voltammetry
for the stepped Pt electrodes in Figure 3A,B. The sign “n”
in (B,C) indicates the atomic width of the (111) terraces of the Pt
electrodes. (D) Cathodic branch of the voltammogram of Pt(pc) microelectrode (25 μm diam.), demonstrating that at
high current densities up to at least 0.5 A/cm2, the diffusion-limiting
current is not reached, suggesting that at lower overpotentials in
0.1 M HClO4 no significant diffusion limitations can be
expected. There are certain differences between the data analysis
for microelectrodes and macroelectrodes, but they are not sufficient
to explain the absence of the diffusion-limiting current for the microelectrodes.

Figure 4A shows
that, in line with Figures 2 and 3, introducing specific surface
defects indeed increases the HER activity of Pt[n(111) × (111)] electrodes. Pt(331), Pt(221), and Pt(775) show
HER activities that are similar to those reported for one of the most
active alloy surfaces of Cu–Pt(111) NSAs. Figure 4B shows a bar chart comparing
the activity at the reference point of −0.036 V (vs RHE) for
the Pt(hkl) and polycrystalline Pt samples normalized
to the geometric surface area. It can be seen that the stepped surfaces
can display more than twofold activity enhancements with respect to
Pt(111). However, taking into account that the experiments (Figure 3B) reveal a noticeable
increase in the amount of *H adsorption sites for the stepped Pt single
crystals, the corresponding activities should be corrected. The results
of this correction are shown in Figure 4C. It can be seen that the maximal corrected activity
is observed for Pt[4(111) × (111)] electrodes.

They demonstrate
an ∼1.8-fold activity improvement over
Pt(111) and an ∼1.5-fold improvement over polycrystalline Pt. Figure 4D presents the data
obtained as an additional reference for the HER: this reaction is
likely intrinsically not diffusion-limited at low current densities
at pH = 1. Even at a current density of 0.5 A/cm2, the
diffusion-limited current is not reached. However, some contributions
of the diffusion are not excluded at such high current densities.

On the basis of our theoretical modeling and experimental data,
we suggest that the active sites which govern the catalytic activity
of pure Pt electrodes are located at concave sites with slightly increased
coordination, similar to the optimal active sites for the oxygen reduction
reaction on Pt surfaces,15,22 and in contrast to
those for CO oxidation.31 These HER sites
bind *H more weakly than Pt(111) terraces, similar to that of CuPt(111)
NSAs.3

Although it has been suggested
(see, e.g., ref (32)) that the HER activity
on Pt is not particularly structure-sensitive (though with some exceptions
related to Pt(110) and Pt(100)33), our
data suggest that such an idea is probably oversimplified. The latter
opinion was supported by measurements using Pt[n(100)
× (111)] or other families of stepped surfaces.33 For the sake of discussion, it is interesting to compare
our results on Pt[n(111) × (111)] and those
reported in the literature for Pt[n(111) × (100)]
(Figure 5),33 where only the type of steps is changed [(111)
vs (100)]. For Pt[n(111) × (100)] electrodes,
the activity improvement is also present, but it is less than 20%
( see Figure 5). Interestingly,
the same ref (33) reports
almost no improvement over Pt(111) when using Pt[n(100) × (hkl)] surfaces.

Figure 5 Relative “apparent”
exchange current densities for
Pt[n(111) × (100)] surfaces as reported in ref (33). n =
∞ represents Pt(111).

This suggests that while surface coordination is a primary
factor
to enhance the activity, it might not be the only one in aqueous solution,
where step symmetry is also important to define water solvation.34,35 Note in passing that also for the oxygen reduction reaction it has
been observed that Pt(111) surfaces with (111)-like steps are more
active than those with (100)-like steps.27 Thus, only specific types of surface defects with “just right”
coordination and beneficial adsorbate–solvent interactions
enable high HER activities at nonuniform Pt surfaces.

Summary and Conclusions
In this work, we offer the following new findings related to the
electrocatalytic HER at Pt surfaces in acidic media:(i) The HER is a structure-sensitive
electrocatalytic
reaction. The sensitivity is, however, limited to only certain concave
defects, found in large quantities at, for example, Pt[n(111) × (111)] electrodes.

(ii) The most active catalytic sites at
pure Pt surfaces should have generalized coordination numbers close
to 7.7. Examples of such sites are the threefold hollow or bridge
sites at the step bottoms of Pt[n(111) × (111)],
with n = 3 or 4.

(iii) The most active pure platinum surface
in 0.1 M HClO4, namely, Pt[4(111) × (111)], has an
HER activity that is slightly lower (∼10–20%) than that
measured for the most active alloy [Cu–Pt(111) NSA] under similar
conditions.

(iv) To maximize
the specific and mass
HER activity of nanostructured pure Pt electrocatalysts, it is important
to modify the shape of the nanoparticles to create “concave
catalytic centers” with the values of the generalized coordination
numbers close to those of the step bottoms at Pt[n(111) × (111)] surfaces.

(v) The predictive power of the coordination–activity
plots is sufficient to rationalize the trends in HER activities.



Experimental Section
Generalized Coordination
Numbers
The generalized coordination
number of a site i is estimated arithmetically from
the sum of the conventional coordination numbers (cnj) of its ni nearest
neighbors and normalized by the maximum number of neighbors found
in the bulk of the crystal (cnmax)16 1  

Note that cnmax is different
for each crystal system and also differs per site so that for an fcc
metal such as Pt, top sites have a maximum of 12 neighbors, whereas
bridge and threefold hollow sites can have up to 18 and 22 neighbors,
respectively. Detailed examples on the assessment of generalized coordination
numbers can be found in Figure 6 for Pt(111) and elsewhere for stepped surfaces and nanoparticles.3,15,16,36

Figure 6 Evaluation
of the generalized coordination numbers on the four
different adsorption sites on Pt(111): (A) top, (B) bridge, (C) hcp
hollow, and (D) fcc hollow sites. In each case, the sites for which
the assessment is made appear in red, their surface nearest neighbors
appear in blue, and their subsurface nearest neighbors appear in green.

Computational Methods
The DFT calculations were carried
out with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package,37 using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation
functional38 and the projector augmented-wave
method.39 The slabs contained four metal
layers: the topmost two and the adsorbates were completely free to
relax, whereas the atoms at the two bottommost layers were immobile
and the interatomic distance between them was 2.81 Å. The geometry
optimizations were made with the conjugate-gradient scheme using 450
eV as plane-wave cutoff, until the maximum force on any free atom
was below 0.01 eV Å–1. The vertical layer of
the vacuum between periodic images was larger than 14 Å, and
dipole corrections were also incorporated. We used kBT = 0.2 eV, and the energies were extrapolated
to T = 0 K. Given that the differences in *H adsorption
energies are typically small among Pt active sites, we used dense k-point meshes for the slabs in Figure 2B–F, namely, 10 × 10 × 1
for Pt(111), 10 × 5 × 1 for Pt(553), 10 × 9 ×
1 for Pt(331), and 7 × 7 × 1 for Pt(111) with 2 and 3 adatoms.

The computational hydrogen electrode approach40 permits the use of the chemical potential of H2 instead of that of (H+ + e–) in solution,
following the equilibrium 2  H2 was
simulated in a cubic box
of 15 Å × 15 Å × 15 Å using a Γ-point
distribution and kBT =
0.001 eV. Thus, the H* adsorption energies are given as 3  where
* is a free surface site. The free energies
of the adsorbates are taken as 4  EDFT and ZPE are
the DFT-calculated total energy and zero-point energy. ZPE*H on Pt is 0.15 eV, whereas ZPEH2 is 0.27 eV. TS*H is 0.01 eV at 300 K and TSH2 is 0.40 eV.

We used Nørskov et
al.’s microkinetic model to estimate
the HER exchange current densities (i0).6 In this approach, i0 for ΔGH < 0 (left
leg of the volcano plot) is estimated as 5  In eq 4, T =
300 K, −ec = 1.602 × 10–19 C is the
charge of an electron, kB = 8.617 ×
10–5 eV K–1 is the Boltzmann constant,
and k0 is
a free parameter in the model set to provide exchange current densities
on the same order of magnitude of the experimental ones but has no
influence on the activity trends (we used a value of 2 × 1017 s–1 cm–2). On the other
hand, when ΔGH > 0 (right leg
of
the volcano plot), i0 is given as 6  Although eqs 5 and 6 describe correctly the
HER activity trends, there are some fair criticisms to Figure 1.41,42 One of them is that all DFT data were calculated on the closest-packed
surface of each metal disregarding two important facts: (1) elements
such as Nb, Mo, W, and Co on the strong binding side of the plot are
oxides under HER conditions and deviate largely from the trends. As
oxides typically bind adsorbates more weakly than metals,43 the actual deviations would be smaller if oxidized
phases were considered. Besides, Pt is metallic and stable under HER
conditions. (2) The model assumes the same prefactor for all metals.
As all sites in Figure 2A are made of Pt, the assumption of an identical prefactor is more
justifiable.

As shown in Figure 2B, our calculations were made at low *H coverage for
three reasons:
(1) we use the PBE exchange–correlation functional, unlike
Nørskov et al.,6 who used RPBE. Thus,
our hydrogen adsorption energies are stronger than those reported
by Nørskov et al. However, the differential adsorption energies
should be similar for the two functionals, and increasing the *H coverage
would weaken ΔGH to a point in which
they will probably match those of Nørskov et al., whereas the
ΔΔGH would remain relatively
constant. (2) The prediction that ideal HER sites for the HER must
have ΔGH = 0 is functional-independent.9 (3) Pt alloys known to bind hydrogen more weakly
than Pt(111) have higher HER activity.3,30 These three
facts altogether suggest that Pt(111) is located on the left side
of the volcano plot, regardless of the actual coverage of *H and its
adsorption energy. As Pt(111) binds *H slightly stronger than desired,
a weakening of its adsorption strength is provided by sites with larger
coordination, as Figure 2A shows clear distinctions between step edges (strong binding), (111)
terraces (intermediate binding), and step bottoms (weak binding).

Activity Measurements
The electrochemical setup used
for the measurements is described elsewhere.44 Prior to the measurements, the setup was cleaned with a 3:1 mixture
of H2SO4 and H2O2 (both
Suprapur, Merck, Germany) followed by multiple-time boiling in ultrapure
water (Evoqua, Germany).

The bead-type working electrode Pt(331)
(Icryst, Jülich, Germany), Pt(221), Pt(775) (both obtained
from Prof. Juan Feliù, University of Alicante, Spain), and
Pt(111) (Mateck, Jülich, Germany) single crystals were flame-annealed
in an isobutane flame and cooled down in a 1000 ppm CO (4.7, Air Liquide,
Germany) mixture with Ar (5.0, Air Liquide, Germany). The quality
of the surface was confirmed by measuring the characteristic voltammograms
of the electrode in the hanging meniscus configuration in an Ar-saturated
HClO4 (Suprapur, Merck, Germany) and comparing the results
to that of the literature.24

Before
the activity measurements, the Pt(hkl)
electrodes were characterized in the range of potentials between ca.
−0.04 and −0.086 V versus RHE, commonly used in the
literature, with a scanning rate of 50 mV/s in an Ar-saturated HClO4.

A polycrystalline Pt microelectrode (CH Instruments,
USA) with
a diameter of 25 μm was cleaned by scanning (scan rate 50 mV/s)
the potential between 1.52 and −0.13 V versus RHE in 0.1 M
Ar-saturated HClO4. Afterward, the HER activity was measured
in this electrolyte while scanning between 0.82 and −0.17 V
with a scan rate of 50 mV/s.
