Casein,
one of the major constituent of milk protein, is considered
to be a good candidate for oral drug delivery system. Also, milk transports
various essential fatty acid to blood through dietary supplements.
In this study, we have explored the alteration in the structural characteristic
in terms of the modulations in the microenvironment of the protein
in the presence of different types of fatty acids. Herein, we have
observed that the unsaturation of fatty acids mostly affects the structure
of casein micelles (CMs) by impinging upon the hydrophobic force of
interaction following a decrease in the electrostatic interaction
of various amino acid unit. Alteration of such forces is responsible
for the increase in the aggregate size, modification in the protein
secondary structure, and different morphology of CMs. Fluorescence
behavior of 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran indicates that the rigidity of the microenvironment
is the main characteristic of the fatty acid binding, and the binding
constant increases with the fatty acid chain length for saturated
fatty acid or with the introduction of unsaturation onto it. Fluorescence
lifetime imaging microscopy study indicates that the microstructure
of CMs becomes more compact in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids,
and this is also responsible for the increase in the diffusion time
of the probe. Moreover, decrease in the fluorescence of extrinsic
probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate with the addition of unsaturated
fatty acid reveals that these fatty acids alter the electrostatic
interaction between casein units, more specifically in case of the
surface-bound κ-casein. Therefore, this study provides a very
useful information on the binding of fatty acids and helps to evaluate
other fatty acid, as well as different small molecules binding in
the applicative medicinal purpose.

1 Introduction
Protein-based
biometrical is always an important system to be employed
in the controlled delivery of drugs, nutrients, bioactive peptides,
and so forth.1−3 Over the past few decades, drug delivery systems
based on food proteins have gained quite a remarkable attention due
to their usability for various reason, e.g., excellent functional
properties, high nutritional value, emulsification, gelation, foaming,
and water-binding capacity, as well as their applications as ingredients
in the food industry.1,4

Milk is usually known as
a complete food for supplying carbohydrates,
fatty acids (FAs), vitamins, inorganic elements, and proteins.5,6 In bovine milk, the major ingredient protein is casein (80%) with
respect to whey protein (20%). Casein accommodates low-molecular-weight
compounds, mainly calcium phosphate, to supply two essential elements,
calcium and phosphorus.1,7 Casein (Scheme 1) contains mainly four types of phosphoproteins,
αS1-, αS2-, β-, and κ-casein, in proportions
of 4:1:4:1 approximately by weight.1,8−10 The variations in molecular weights are between 19 and 25 kDa, with
the number of amino acids ranging between 169 and 209.1,7 The average isoelectric point of different units of casein is between
4.6 and 4.8.9 Structurally, casein resembles
the block copolymers comprising high level of hydrophobic or hydrophilic
amino acid residues blocks (amphiphilic blocks) and shows a strong
tendency to form self-assembles into casein micelles (CMs) in the
aqueous solution.1,9 The hydrophobic residues are concentrated
in the interior part of casein micelles, whereas the surface layer
is surrounded by the hydrophilic and charged ones to provide the right
balance of the steric and electrostatic effects in the micelle.1 Also, the presence of calcium phosphate in casein
plays a pivotal role in maintaining the compactness of micelles. Actually,
the colloidal calcium phosphate makes a link between the phosphoserine
residues of different types of casein molecules in the aggregate.1

Fatty acids (FAs, they are long-chain organic
molecule containing
the terminal carboxylic functional group) are the basic units of the
cell membranes as a component of phospholipids and glycolipids.11 Also, fatty acids are joined together with one
glycerol molecule to form triacylglycerols, and also these are capable
of storing fatty energy in the adipose tissue.11,12 Additionally, they are responsible for many biological activities,
i.e., influencing cell and tissue metabolism, function, and responsiveness
to hormonal and other signals.11,12 These biological activities
collectively work for many biological functions (e.g., regulation
of membrane structure and function, regulation of intracellular signaling
pathways, regulation of the production of bioactive lipid mediators,
and gene expression).12 As a consequence,
these effects help to reduce the disease risk and maintain a good
health condition.

The supply of fatty acids in the blood mainly
comes from diet,
and milk is regarded as the main supplier of fatty acids.5,13 The major (∼70%) fatty acids in milk are the saturated ones.
In milk, palmitic acid, myristic acid, and stearic acid are present
approximately in 30, 11, and 12% by weight, respectively.14 The remaining proportion mainly comprises short-chain
fatty acids. Besides, approximately 25% of the fatty acids in milk
are monounsaturated, where oleic acid is the major constituent (∼23.8%)
by weight of the total fatty acids in the dairy milk.14 Also, 2.3% of the weight fraction of total fatty acid is
polyunsaturated fatty acids, where linoleic and α-linolenic
acids present in 1.6 and 0.7% by weight are the main constituents.
Also, milk fat contains some amount of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids
in the ratio 2.3:1.14 But, there are no
exact details to identify the amount of fatty acids content in an
individual milk protein. However, some reports state that globular
protein is responsible for carrying the fatty acids.5 In case of β-lactoglobulin, the binding affinity
of short-chain fatty acids to protein is relatively low, and the binding
constant of fatty acids increases with increase in the length of aliphatic
chain.5 Also, Aynié et al. have
reported that the interaction efficiencies of milk proteins in the
emulsion with nitroxide homologues of fatty acids decreases in the
order of αs1-casein > β-lactoglobulin >
β-casein
≈ whole casein.15 In that report,
they proposed that this type of high interaction of αs1casein occurs through the hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic interactions
between the lipid polar heads and the protein polar side chains. A
recent study suggests that entropy and electrostatic energy are the
main important factors to control the binding affinities of fatty
acids for β-lactoglobulin.16 Therefore,
we can say that the structural changes and interaction pattern of
β-lactoglobulin in the presence of various fatty acids enriched
the understanding of the metabolism of fatty acids. However, there
is no such report to describe how fatty acids interact with casein.
Only in some specific cases it has been shown that casein can accommodate
polyunsaturated fatty acid.17 However,
in case of β-casein, it has been found that in epithelial cells,
unsaturated fatty acids stimulate the degradation of protein, whereas
saturated fatty acids fail to do so.18 Therefore,
in a broader perspective, it will be fascinating to study the alteration
of various forces inside the CMs in the presence of fatty acids.

In this present work, we plan to demonstrate the change in the
microenvironment of CMs as a result of modification of various forces
of interactions in the presence of different types of fatty acids.
Actually, a change in the microenvironment precisely reveals the real
structural scenario. For that, we have used two common extrinsic fluorophores,
i.e., 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) and 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS)
(Scheme 2). To extract
information about the extent
of interaction, structure, and dynamical properties of CMs in the
presence of fatty acids, we have performed fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)
experiments. We have used dynamic light scattering (DLS) and circular
dichroism (CD) techniques to gain knowledge about the alteration in
the size and secondary structures. In addition, we have also investigated
the morphological changes in CMs by using the field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM). Moreover, the present study is interesting
at the same time important to understand the role of various fatty
acids toward the structural change of casein due to binding. Herein,
we have used three saturated fatty acids that vary in their aliphatic
chain length (myrisitic acid, MA; steric acid, SA; and arachidic acid,
AA) and two unsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid, OA; and linoleic acid,
LA) (Scheme 1) differing
in the amounts of unsaturation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural
Change of CMs in the Presence of
Fatty Acids
2.1.1 Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS) study
CMs are colloidal protein clusters with diameters
ranging between
50 and 500 nm, with an average of roughly 200 nm, and they consist
of different casein proteins.10,19 In an aqueous medium,
CMs show two peaks around 50 and 300 nm, with an average size of around
270 nm. Figure 1 shows
the effect of fatty acid on the size of the CMs. As shown in that
figure, fatty acid changes the size of CMs from smaller to larger,
with the exception of MA and SA. For those two saturated fatty acids,
no substantial increase in size has been observed. However, the other
saturated fatty acid AA has been found to considerably change the
size of the CMs (from 268 to 324.5 nm). In the case of unsaturated
fatty acids, the particles of CMs mostly increase in size (413 and
419 nm with OA and LA). This means that the unsaturated fatty acids
alter the nature of micellar aggregate of CMs more than the saturated
ones do. Moreover, in a comparison among the saturated fatty acids,
the size of the micellar aggregates of CMs depends upon the chain
length of the fatty acids.

Figure 1 Change in the average size of CMs (0.025 mg
mL–1) with the addition of various saturated and
unsaturated fatty acids
(50 μM).

2.1.2 Circular
Dichroism (CD) Study
All
of the casein varieties consist of a substantial number of hydrophobic
amino acids, and some of them (especially β- and κ-caseins)
contain a large number of hydrophobic blocks in their sequences.10 Also, these caseins do not show any definitive
permanent secondary and tertiary structures. For these reasons, casein
is regarded as a “rheomorphic” or “natively disordered”
protein.10 Sometimes, the addition of a
small molecule or a change in the environment allows this type of
proteins to attain a definite conformation.20,21 In that case, a modification in the hydrophobic and electrostatic
interaction is responsible for such type of changes. In this study,
CD (0.1 mg mL–1) spectra of casein exhibit a negative
band around 200 nm, suggesting an irregular structure (Figure S1, Supporting Information). With the
addition of fatty acid, as such, no change is observed for that band.
Interestingly, in the case of unsaturated fatty acid, a little change
in the band characteristic is observed around the 222 nm region. This
is the suggestive region for an α-helix structure (Figure S1, Supporting Information). This means
that in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids, the secondary structure
also gets changed along with an increase in the size of CMs from an
irregular coil to an α-helix structure. In a recent report,
such a structural changeover in the case of κ-casein due to
the addition of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide has been described.20 Therefore, this result indicates that unsaturated
fatty acids render some kind of assistance to change the secondary
structure of CMs via the modulation of the hydrophobic and electrostatic
force of interactions of surface-binding κ-casein.

2.2 Photophysical Property of Pyrene in CMs
Pyrene is a
well-studied fluorophore to probe the heterogeneity
of the micellar medium, and it is frequently employed to determine
the CMC of the surfactants.8,22 Now, in this case,
to understand the change in the heterogeneity inside the CMs, we have
plotted I1/I3 with the fatty acid concentrations. In high concentrations of CMs
(>2 mg mL–1), we have not observed a substantial
change in the ratio of I1/I3 with the addition of fatty acids (data not shown). So,
we select a low concentration of CMs (0.025 mg mL–1) to study the effect of fatty acids. Figure 2 depicts the change in I1/I3 with the increasing concentration
of fatty acids, which indicates that for saturated fatty acids, the
changes are very less (from 1.53 to 1.48). However, for unsaturated
fatty acid, interestingly, the value decreases gradually. The change
is more in case of OA than that of LA. This indicates that with the
addition of unsaturated fatty acids, the CMs become more hydrophobic
due to the occupancy of fatty acids inside the micelle by displacing
the water molecule therein. However, in the presence of saturated
fatty acids, the hydrophobic nature around the pyrene does not change
much.

third band ratio vs concentration fatty acids at 298 K.

2.3 Study of the Fluorescence
of CMs
Estimation of the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins
is a convenient
method to understand its binding properties in aqueous solutions with
small molecules. Selective excitation of tryptophan (λex= 295 nm) of CMs shows a broad emission profile with the emission
maxima around 351 nm. With the addition of fatty acids into the casein
solution, the fluorescence intensity decreases gradually. The quenching
of the fluorescence indicates the possible interaction of fatty acids
with casein. As the solubility of fatty acids is quite low in an aqueous
medium (even in casein solution), we are not able to monitor the total
quenching processes and also cannot estimate the binding constant
from the Scatchard plot. Therefore, we employ the Stern–Volmer
equation23,24 (eq 1) for further analysis 1  where F0 and F are fluorescence intensities
in the absence and presence
of a quencher (fatty acids), [Q] is the fatty acid concentration (μM),
and KSV is the Stern–Volmer quenching
constant, which can be determined from the linear fit of the F0/F plot against [Q].

Figure 3 depicts the
linear plot of F0/F as
a function of fatty acid concentrations. The estimated KSV value is more in the case of unsaturated fatty acids
(8493 and 7603 M–1 for OA and LA, respectively)
than that of saturated fatty acids (2734, 3730, and 4430 M–1 for MA, SA, and AA, respectively). The higher values of KSV in the case of unsaturated fatty acids suggest
that these acids interact strongly with casein than the saturated
ones. Among the saturated fatty acids, long-chain fatty acid AA strongly
binds casein and the binding efficiency decreases with the decreasing
chain length. Besides, no change in the fluorescence lifetime (λex = 295 nm) of tryptophan fluorescence indicates that this
quenching is static in nature (data are not shown).

fatty acids concentration (λex = 295 nm and λem = 351 nm), with the line showing the linear fit of data
with an intercept of 1.

2.4 Characterizing the Interaction of Fatty Acids
with CMs by Using DCM as a Fluorescence Probe
DCM is a neutral
hydrophobic molecule, and it is known to reside in the hydrophobic
region of protein, micelle, and vesicle.24−26 Change in the
photophysical properties of fluorophore indicates an alteration in
the microenvironment of the hydrophobic region. In water, DCM shows
a broad emission band (λex = 480 nm), with λem of around 635 nm (Figure S2,
Supporting Information). With the addition of CMs, the emission band
is slightly blue shifted (∼12 nm), with an increase in the
emission intensity (∼2-fold). Figure 4a indicates that with increasing fatty acid
concentration, the fluorescence intensity increases for all of the
fatty acids except MA, and the order of increment is OA > LA >
SA
> AA > MA. Also, with increase in the fluorescence intensity,
the
band further blue shifts, and this shifting is found to be maximum
for OA (λem ∼ 592 nm). Moreover, the change
in the steady state anisotropy of DCM with the addition of fatty acids
(Figure 4b) shows a
similar trend (observed from fluorescence study), but little increase
in anisotropy value is found with MA. Actually, the anisotropy value
signifies the rigidity of the microenvironment surrounding the probe.
Therefore, we can say that the enhancement of fluorescence intensity
is due to the location of the DCM in the hydrophobic region, and with
the addition of fatty acids, the rigidity of probe molecule becomes
higher with the increase in hydrophobic nature of the microenvironment. Figure 4c shows the florescence
decay plot of DCM in casein in the presence and absence of different
fatty acids. The corresponding biexponential fitted data are tabulated
in Table 1. This table
indicates that the value of fast lifetime component increases with
the increase in the chain length of saturated fatty acid from MA to
AA (from 0.096 to 0.128 ns), along with the increase in fluorescence
intensity. Besides, no noticeable change (∼±5%) is observed
in the longer lifetime value (2.39–2.43 ns). However, the average
lifetime in the presence of AA and SA is quite similar (0.203 and
0.213 ns), with a slightly different distribution in the lifetime
components. Moreover, with an increasing unsaturation of the fatty
acids, the average lifetime increases (0.255 and 0.270 ns for OA and
LA, respectively) with increase in the contribution from the slow
lifetime component. In many instances, it is noticed that the lifetime
of DCM increases with increase in the rigidity of the hydrophobic
microenvironment.25,26 This means that for saturated
fatty acids, the compactness or rigidity inside the microenvironment
is enhanced with the increase in the chain length of the fatty acids
(from MA to AA). Also, the alteration in the unsaturation of fatty
acids exhibits a substantial enhancement in the rigidity of CMs. Furthermore,
the earlier report describes that due to the incorporation of DCM
in the confined hydrophobic medium, the emission maxima are largely
blue shifted and the decay pattern shows the wavelength dependence.26,27 However, in our case, we did not observe any such wavelength dependence
(data not shown). This means that the rigidly of microenvironment
is not so high to get different information. Actually, in a nonpolar
solvent, a large blue shift in DCM has been observed with no such
wavelength dependence. Therefore, we can say that the enhancement
in fluorescence intensity and lifetime DCM is due to increase in the
hydrophobic nature inside the CMs.

We
also perform the FLIM study to get the information about the
lifetime distribution of DCM within the CMs. Figure 5 demonstrates the FLIM images of casein micelle
in the absence and presence of fatty acids. Due to the inherent lower
resolution of FLIM images, we are unable to identify the structural
change in the small-size caseins. For that we monitor comparatively
larger aggregate to understand the facts (Figure 5). These images indicate that the apparent
size of the casein is somewhat increased with the addition of fatty
acid. In addition, the compactness of casein is also enhanced with
the addition of fatty acids, and it is more in case of OA and LA (Figure 5e,f); this type of
findings are also observed in the FESEM study (Figure S3, Supporting Information). However, FESEM study has
been performed in the dried condition. Nevertheless, those results
provide important information to compare the structural change with
FLIM studies in a more low (nanometer) dimension. Figure S3a (Supporting Information) displays the FESEM image
of CMs only; it is found that the average diameter of the micelle
is around 200 nm, although they are somewhat polydispersed and not
uniformly shaped. It looks like various submicellar unit assemble
to form a spongelike morphology as observed in the FLIM image also
(Figure 5a). With the
addition of fatty acids, it is found that the size of CMs increases
somewhat with some change in the morphology, except in the case of
MA. In the presence of AA and LA, the CMs form a nice branched architecture,
followed by a preferential growth of various casein units. But in
the presence of SA and OA, such an architecture has not been found.
Rather, the CMs are converted to round nanoentities, which are segregated
from each other. In comparison between the saturated and unsaturated
fatty acids, no remarkable difference is observed, except the alteration
in the compactness of the nanosphere for OA and LA, which also corroborated
the findings from the FLIM study. Actually, unsaturated fatty acids
form more compact structures than saturated ones do, and the spongy
characteristic of the structure is not observed. It is known that
the κ-casein generally occupies the micellar surface that determines
many of the properties of the particles, especially their stability
toward aggregation.10,19 Therefore, we can say that AA,
OA and LA interact with κ-casein predominantly to form a nice
aggregated architecture, and at the same time impart compactness to
the casein structure. This compactness can also be explained by the
measuring the lifetime distribution of DCM, and the observed lifetime
distribution of DCM is on the higher side for the unsaturated fatty
acids than that for saturated fatty acids (Figure 6). As DCM is a hydrophobic probe, its lifetime
will be increased when the surrounding microenvironment is changed
to be more hydrophobic and at the same time rigid.

The FCS technique is an elegant
and sensitive method to determine
the diffusion dynamic of the heterogeneous assemblies in sub-microsecond
time scales.25,28,29 Here, the fluctuation in the fluorescence intensity is taken into
account within a small volume, i.e., at the single-molecule level,
to determine the diffusion coefficient (Dt), which can be utilized to extract the information about the size,
morphology, and structural heterogeneity of the organized assemblies.25,28 In this study, we have measured the fluorescence autocorrelation
trace (FCS trace) of DCM in the presence of casein with different
fatty acids. The normalized traces are highlighted in Figure 7. For a higher polydispersity
in size, multiple fittings are performed for different FCS traces,
and “Dt” is calculated from
the fitting data (Table S1, Supporting
Information). In the casein medium DCM shows two types of diffusion
coefficients, where the faster component (Dt1) of 302.78 μm2 s–1 corresponds
to the diffusion of DCM in the bulk aqueous medium and the slower
component (Dt2) comes from the incorporation
of the DCM into the CMs. Now, we compare the difference in the diffusion
rate (Dt2) of DCM due to the addition
of various fatty acids onto the CMs. The results indicate that in
the case of unsaturated fatty acids, the Dt2 (13.10 and 14.41 μm2 s–1 for
OA and LA, respectively) is comparatively slower with respect to casein
(24.01 μm2 s–1) and the Dt2 after the addition of saturated fatty acids
is 20.23, 19.73, and 18.32 μm2 s–1 for MA, SA, and AA, respectively. Also, the contribution of Dt2 is more for unsaturated fatty acids (0.30
and 0.26 for OA and LA, respectively), whereas, in the case of saturated
fatty acid, it is found that the Dt2 value
is marginally altered with the increasing carbon chain of fatty acid
from MA to AA. Therefore, from these results, we can say that the
diffusion motion of CMs in the solution is considerably slowed down
in the presence unsaturated fatty acid. This could be due to the formation
of larger sized aggregates.

2.5 Photophysical
Investigation with ANS
ANS has been widely used to study
the microheterogeneity and surface-related
phenomena of proteins, micelles, polymers, and lipid bilayer membrane
systems.30 The ANS shows a low green fluorescence
at around 524 nm; but in the presence of CMs, the band is largely
blue shifted (∼30 nm), with a substantial increase (∼2-fold)
in the fluorescence intensity (Figure S4, Supporting Information). However, the increment in intensity is
quite less as compared to that in micelles, polymers, and lipid bilayer. Figure 8a displays the change
in the fluorescence intensity of ANS with the addition of fatty acids.
It is found that in the case of saturated fatty acids, the fluorescence
intensity increases in the order of SA > AA > MA. However, for
unsaturated
fatty acids, the fluorescence intensity initially increases slightly,
but after that interestingly the fluorescence intensity decreases
gradually with an increase in the fatty acid concentration. The drop
in the intensity is more for OA than that for LA. However, at 50 μM
concentration, the change in fluorescence is almost similar, and the
effect of LA still exists (we could not measure the data beyond 50
μM due to the instability of the sample), whereas changes in
the intensity saturate for OA. The change in anisotropy value shows
a similar trend (Figure 8b). This means that the change in fluorescence is due to the rigidity
of microenvironment experienced by the probe ANS. We also studied
the excited state phenomenon to understand the dynamics of the ANS
probe in the presence of casein micelle. The excited sate decay profile
is highlighted in Figure 8c, and fitted parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The lifetime of ANS in the
aqueous medium is biexponential in nature, where shorter lifetime
component (0.234 ns) is predominant (99.7%) than that of slow component
(4.61 ns). However, in the presence of casein, the decay traces of
ANS exhibit another slower lifetime component (13.66 ns), and it is
presumably arising due to the casein-bound ANS. The incorporation
of ANS into CMs provides an increase in τavg value
(0.536 ns) than in an aqueous medium (0.247 ns). Actually, here, the
rigidness of ANS is due to its incorporation in the hydrophobic region
of CMs and consequent formation of ion pair between the positively
charged amino acid residue (Arg/Lys/His) and the sulfonate group of
ANS. This effectively reduces the intermolecular charge transfer (CT)
rate that leads to the enhancement in fluorescence, as well as the
τavg value.31Table 2 depicts that with
the addition of saturated fatty acids in CMs, the contribution of
the slow lifetime component increases, leading to an increase in τavg value (0.746, 0.866, and 0.655 ns for MA, SA, and AA, respectively).
With the introduction of unsaturation in the fatty acid, the τavg value is suddenly reduced (0.335 and 0.366 ns for OA and
LA, respectively), even lower than the value observed with CMs only
(0.536 ns). This indicates that in the presence of unsaturated fatty
acids, the ANS is segregated from the CMs to bulk water. Matulis et
al. and others reported that the enhancement of fluorescence
of ANS is not only for the hydrophobic interaction.30−32 Indeed, from
the overall interaction perspective, an electrostatic interaction
via the formation of an ion pair is the major determinant in binding.
Therefore, here, the two fluorophores (DCM and ANS) are mainly regarded
as hydrophobic probes, but they sense the microenvironment differently.
DCM only encounters the enhancement in hydrophobic character of CMs
due to the addition of fatty acids. On the other hand, results of
ANS are quite interesting, which indicate that the reduction in electrostatic
interaction with a concomitant increase in the hydrophobic interaction
due to the addition of unsaturated fatty acid in CMs leads to the
decrease in the fluorescence intensity. It is also interesting to
note that for saturated fatty acids, the increase in fluorescence
lifetime and blue shifting of emission maxima (Figure S5, Supporting Information) of ANS support the formation
of ion pair. This result indicates that the saturated fatty acids
do not substantially affect the association of CMs by imparting hydrophobic
force of interaction. In fact, the hydrophobic interaction slightly
increases without affecting the ion pair formation. This also corroborates
the findings from the FE-SEM study, pyrene fluorescence, and FLIM
images data. Most likely, the low binding nature of saturated fatty
acids could not affect the strong electrostatic interaction. The increase
in hydrophobicity of the CMs only with the increase in unsaturation
in fatty acid is responsible for the decrease in the fluorescence
of ANS. Also the observed pattern (first increase then decrease)in
the fluorescence behavior (intensity and anisotropy) of ANS (Figure 8a and b) in the presence
unsaturated fatty acids looks interesting, and indicates that above
some concentration the fatty acids the hydrophobic nature of interaction
becomes prominent and possibly masks the electrostatic factors substantially.
In the case of unsaturated fatty acid, we observe more changes for
OA than for LA. However, LA contains one more unsaturation unit than
OA. Consequently, more changes are expected to be observed in the
case of LA, if the hydrophobic force is dominated here. From the above
results we may suggest that the strength binding affinity between
unsaturated fatty acid and casein depends upon the appropriate hydrophilic–lipophilic

3 Conclusions
In the present study, we have demonstrated
the change in microenvironment
of CMs in terms of structural alteration due to fatty acid binding.
For this, we have purposely employed different varieties of fatty
acids with increasing aliphatic chain length (MA, SA, and AA) or unsaturation
(OA and LA). The DLS study indicates that in the presence of unsaturated
fatty acids, the size of CMs is significantly enhanced than that with
saturated fatty acid; also, there is little structural changeover
of CMs from irregular to α-helix as is evident from the CD studies.
Pyrene fluorescence studies have further indicated that the hydrophobic
nature inside the CMs increases with increase in fatty acid chain
length and unsaturation. High Ksv value
for OA and LA indicates that unsaturated fatty acids bind strongly
with CMs. It also found that Ksv value
progressively increases with increasing fatty acid chain length. To
understand the facts more clearly, we have used two extrinsic fluorophores
(DCM and ANS). These molecules differently sense an alteration in
the microenvironmental rigidity. Fluorescence and FLIM studies suggest
that compactness and rigidity of CMs are higher in the case of unsaturated
fatty acid, exhibiting a higher lifetime distribution. Such change
in microenvironment with size is responsible for the observed slow
diffusion time (Dt) of the CM-unsaturated
fatty acid complex. Interestingly, in the case of unsaturated fatty
acids, the decrease in fluorescence intensity of ANS has been found.
It could be thought that unsaturated fatty acid adds up more hydrophobicity
to the CMs, specifically to the surface binder κ-casein. For
this reason, the electrostatic interaction of CMs is largely modified
to show a little ordered structure (α-helix), increase in the
size of aggregate, and a drop in ANS fluorescence intensity. Eventually,
this study provides the information about the important aspect of
fatty acid binding by monitoring the change in the microstructure
of casein, and this will further help to understand the pattern of
interaction of small molecules as nutrients with milk.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Casein
micelles (CMs) were
purchased from TCI Chemicals (Japan) and used as received without
further purification. The used fatty acids for this study were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-(Dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid magnesium(II)
salt hydrate (ANS) were purchased from Exciton and TCI Chemicals (Japan),
respectively. NaCl (analytical grade, Merck, India) and methanol (UV
spectroscopic grade, Spectrochem, India) and all of the other chemicals
were of analytical reagent (AR) grade. Ultrapure Milli-Q water was
used in the study. All of the solutions were prepared in 5 mM sodium
phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 (±0.1). The pH was measured with a
precalibrated EUTECH pH 510 ion pH meter.

4.2 Instrumentation
and Methods
Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed using a Malvern
Nano ZS instrument (model no. ZEN3600) having a thermostated sample
chamber. All of the data were collected using a 4 mW He–Ne
laser (λ = 632 nm).

Field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) images were acquired using a FEI NOVA NANOSEM 450 working
at 5 kV. The film samples spread on the glass slide were coated with
gold particles in a sputter coater.

The CD spectra were collected
on a Jasco J-815 circular dichroism
(CD) spectropolarimeter over a wavelength range of 190–260
nm, with a scan speed of 50 nm/min at 298 K under constant N2 flushing. A 0.1 cm thick quartz cell was used, and two consecutive
scans were taken to generate each spectrum. All of the spectra were
baseline corrected by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer solution
under the same condition.

The UV–vis absorption spectra
were collected by scanning
solution in the 1 cm cuvette in the wavelength range 250–600
nm on a Shimadzu UV-2600 absorption spectrophotometer equipped with
a TCC-260 thermoelectrically temperature-controlled cell holder.

The steady-state fluorescence spectra were accrued with a Horiba
Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (Flurolog-3) attached to a temperature-controlled
water-cooled cuvette holder to maintain the constant experimental
temperature (298 K), and a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette was used
to take the scan of the solutions.

Steady-state anisotropy (r) was also measured
by the same fluorescence instrument. The steady-state anisotropy (r) is expressed as follows 2   3  where IVV and IVH are the
emission intensities collected from
the sample when the excitation polarizer is oriented vertically and
the emission polarizer is placed vertically and horizontally, respectively. G is the correction factor for the instrument and estimated
by keeping the excitation polarizer horizontal and the emission polarizer
vertical and horizontal successively.

The fluorescence lifetime
studies were carried out using a time-correlated
single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer from Edinburgh Instrument
Ltd. (U.K.) as described in our earlier report.33 Briefly, the samples were excited at 376.0 and 442.6 nm
using a picoseconds laser diodes (EPL-375 and EPL-445) for ANS and
DCM, respectively, and the signals were collected at a magic angle
of 54.7° using a high-speed photomultiplier tube (H10720-01,
photosensor module from Hamamatsu, Japan). The instrument response
functions (IRFs) were ∼260 ps (full width at half-maximum,
FWHM) for these two laser diodes. All of the fluorescence decays were
monitored at the corresponding emission maxima obtained from the steady-state
fluorescence measurements. The data were analyzed using a F-900 software
from Edinburgh Instruments. All of the fluorescence decays were fitted
with a multiexponential function considering a χ2 value close to 1, which is an indication of a good fit.

Now,
the average lifetime of the samples was calculated by multiexponential
decay function using the following equation 4  where ai is the pre-exponential terms of ith component
of τ.

The fluorescence lifetime images of DCM in the casein
medium in
the absence and presence of fatty acids were taken using a DCS-120
confocal laser scanning system (Becker & Hickl DCS-120) with an
inverted microscope from Zeiss with 20× objective. For this experiment,
488 nm laser was used as an illumination source. A suitable filter
(510LP, Chroma) was placed before the detectors to block the exciting
laser light. The fluorescence was focused through a pinhole (1.5 mm).
The polarized dual-channel optical scanner DCS-120 from Becker &
Hickl (bh) was used with a galvodrive controller unit (Becker &
Hickl GDA- 120), and the signal was detected by a pair of HMP-100-40
GaAsP hybrid detectors (ID-Quantique ID100). This FLIM system employs
the bh SPCM data acquisition software. The signal was subsequently
processed by the SPCImage software module by performing a deconvolution
on the decay data in the pixels of FLIM data. The instrument response
function (IRF) of this setup was ∼100 ps (full width at half-maximum,
FWHM). In each case, the images were taken after some time period
(∼10–15 min) to ensure proper immobilization of the
samples on the glass surface.

The FCS study of the DCM was performed
in the casein medium, adding
various fatty acids using the same instrument for FLIM measurement
with the water-immersion objective (40×). The autocorrelation
function G(τ) has been defined in the following
equation with respect to the temporal fluctuation of fluorescence
intensity in confocal volume. 5  where δF(t) is the fluctuation
in the fluorescence intensity at time t, δF(t + τ)
is the fluctuation after a delay time τ, and ⟨F(t)⟩ is the average fluorescence
intensity.

In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) diffusion
model have been
utilized for fitting the autocorrelation curves and G(τ) can be described as the following equation for c fraction of dyes diffused within in the casein medium. 6  In the above equation, N denotes
the number of fluorophores within the focal volume, φi is the fractional weighting factor for the ith contribution to the autocorrelation curve, τDi is the diffusion time of the fluorescent species within the observation
volume, and τ is the delay or lag time. k denotes
the structure parameter of the excitation volume.

To determine
diffusion coefficient Dt, the following
equation was employed 7  where w0 is the
transverse radius of the confocal volume, and it was calibrated using
a reference sample (R6G) of known diffusion coefficient (426 μm2 s–1). The estimated value of k was found to be 5 and the volume of the excitation volume was ∼1.5
fL with w0 ∼ 365 nm.
