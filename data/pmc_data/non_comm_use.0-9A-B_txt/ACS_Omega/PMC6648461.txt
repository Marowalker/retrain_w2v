Two nickel/nitrogenated
graphene hybrid electrodes (Ni-NrGONH3 and Ni-NrGOAPTES) were
synthesized, and their catalytic activity with respect
to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media was analyzed.
Incorporation of nitrogen to the carbon structure in graphene oxide
(GO) or reduced GO (rGO) flakes in aqueous solutions was carried out
based on two different configurations. NrGONH3 particles were obtained
by a hydrothermal method using ammonium hydroxide as the precursor,
and NGOAPTES particles were obtained
by silanization (APTES functionalization) of GO sheets. Aqueous dispersions
containing NrGONH3 and NGOAPTES particles
were added to the traditional nickel Watts plating bath in order to
prepare the Ni-NrGONH3 and Ni-NrGOAPTES catalysts, respectively. Nickel substrates were coated with the
hybrid nickel electrodeposits and used as electrodes for hydrogen
production. The Ni-NrGO catalysts show a higher activity
than the conventional nickel electrodeposited electrodes, particularly
the ones containing APTES molecules because they allow obtaining a
hydrogen current density 130% higher than conventional Ni-plated electrodes
with a Watts bath in the absence of additives. In addition, both catalysts
show a low deactivation rate during the ageing treatment, which is
a sign of a longer midlife for the catalyst. Cyclic voltammetry and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were used for
examination of the catalytic efficiency of hybrid Ni-NrGO electrodes for HER in KOH solution. High values of exchange current
densities, 8.53 × 10–4 and 2.53 × 10–5 mA cm–2 for HER in alkaline solutions
on Ni-NrGONH3 and Ni-NrGOAPTES electrodes,
respectively, were obtained.

Introduction
The development of high activity electrocatalysts
for the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) is one of the main interests in renewable
energy areas, particularly those that present high stability.1,2 Moreover, nonexpensive and industrially scalable catalysts for alkaline
electrolyser’s electrodes obtained by simple methods are, nowadays,
one of the technological topics most critical for systems useful for
storage and conversion of energy.3−5

Electrolysis in
alkaline medium is one of the most promising processes
for both industrial and laboratory production of hydrogen because
it allows the development of systems of various sizes, thus being
a mature technology. Currently, conventional alkaline electrolysers
use pure nickel electrodes which, although are economical compared
to the catalysts for electrolysis in acid medium, have low catalytic
activity and a high rate of activity loss,6,7 constituting
one of the main drawbacks for the application of this technology in
the framework of hydrogen economy.

Graphene and its derivatives
are the most studied nanomaterials
of recent years because of their particular properties. Thus, when
graphene oxide (GO) is reduced, the rapid mobility of charge carriers
at room temperature reach values of 2 × 105 cm2 V–1 s–1, with an exceptional
conductivity (106 S cm–1), large theoretical
specific surface area (2630 m2 g–1),
and excellent optical transmittance (∼97.7%).8 These outstanding properties indicate that the reduced
GO (rGO) can have great potential as a component in the construction
of hybrid electrodes for various applications.9 Production of rGO flakes has a significantly lower cost than the
graphene thin films, being a nanomaterial with properties similar
to those of graphene, such as high electrical conductivity, a very
important characteristic when it is used as a component of the electrocatalysts.10−12

A promising strategy for tuning the electronic properties
of graphene
and its derivatives is doping them with heteroatoms. This type of
chemical doping has been proved effective in carbon nanotubes with
successful achievements to expand its applications.13−16 The inclusion of N atoms into
the graphene structure allows its transformation into p- or n-type
semiconductors,17 and three common bonding
configurations with the carbon network can be observed: graphitic-N,
pyridinic-N, and pyrrolic-N doped graphene18 It has been proposed that pyridinic-N bonds usually contribute one
p electron to the π system (sp2), pyrrolic-N contributes
two p electrons to the π system (sp3), and graphitic
N (normally denoted as quaternary N) is the N atoms that substitute
C atoms in the hexagonal ring of the graphene structure (sp2).19 Different methods for obtaining nitrogenated
graphene were proposed. The most common method involves modifications
using hydrothermal processes.20 Also, the
functionalization with 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules
has been widely proven, where the amine groups interact with the oxygen
functionalities on GO sheets.21,22 It was also reported
that composite catalysts formed with nickel nanoparticles supported
on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes or nitrogen-doped graphene present
enhanced catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction, and this
feature comes from the synergetic effect of the combined structure.23

In the present paper, we have successfully
prepared two kinds of
stable nickel/nitrogenated-graphene hybrid electrodes, with different
structural characteristics through nickel electrodeposition on nickel
substrates. Evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance of nickel
electrodes for HER in alkaline solutions is strongly improved by the
incorporation of nitrogen-functionalized GO flakes, in the nickel
matrix, changing the reactivity of the samples. The specific surface
area and the inclusion of NGO particles conduce to an enhanced HER
current. Moreover, the method used for hybrid catalysts is industrially
scalable, and it allows its application in real alkaline electrolysis
systems.

Results and Discussion
N-graphene, NrGONH3, and NGOAPTES particles
were obtained by a hydrothermal process and silanization with APTES
molecules, as detailed in the Experimental Section, and aqueous dispersions were obtained with both types of particles.

The electrocatalysts were obtained by plating nickel electrodes
using a conventional Watts bath containing modified N-GO particles as additives. Electrodeposition of 30 μm thickness
nickel films were obtained by a galvanostatic pulse (−0.05
A cm–2) during 1800 s. The uniform approximation
of all species in solution toward the electrode/solution interface
was facilitated by controlled rotation of the electrode. During the
electrodeposition, the potential reaches −5.0 V with both additives
in the plating bath, at which the codeposited GO flakes were electrochemically
reduced to rGO species. Therefore, we have considered that these included
species in the nickel matrix are highly conductive. After the synthesis, Ni-NrGONH3 and Ni-NrGOAPTES electrodes
were ready to evaluate their electrocatalytic activity for the HER.

Structural
Characterization of Freshly Synthetized Electrodes
Figure 1 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of both types of synthesized
electrodes. In the Ni-NrGOAPTES images (Figure 1A,B),
a highly porous structure is observed, where the presence of some
GO flakes can be evidenced between the electrodeposited nickel structures,
forming a network with a high surface area. These types of surface
structures are optimal for the proper functionality required for the
electrocatalyst. Ni-NrGONH3 electrodes (Figure 1C,D) present a lobular surface with high
roughness. Nickel electrodeposits in the presence of both NGO particles are very different to those obtained in the absence of
additives.24

Figure 1 SEM micrograph of (A,B) Ni-NrGOAPTES at two different magnifications
and (C,D) Ni-NrGONH3 at two different
magnifications. All the images were obtained at 5 keV.

Comparison of roughness from different nickel electrodeposits
through
the root mean square (rms) between peaks and valleys of confocal microscopy
image profiles (not shown) is one important factor to establish the
quality of catalyzers. Thus, Ni-NrGOAPTES electrodes have rms values approximately ten times higher
than conventional Ni electrodeposits, whereas Ni-NrGONH3 electrodes are
only seven times more rough (Table 1).

and ratio between crystal planes for each signal of the synthesized
catalysts.

X-ray diffractograms
of both synthesized electrodes, compared with
a pure Ni electrodeposited sample are shown in Figure 2. Characteristic reflection peaks for crystalline
nickel with a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure are clearly present
for all samples. The 2θ values for the Ni(111) and (200) planes
are presented in Table 1, together with the corresponding d-spacing distance
and half peak widths (fwhm). Furthermore, data from Ni-rGO catalysts are included in Table 1, in order to analyze the structural changes that nitrogenated
GO can enter the crystalline surface, in comparison with the pristine
rGO.24 Incorporation of NrGO and rGO flakes in the nickel matrix clearly produces a diminution
in the fwhm, a feature that is usually associated with an increase
of the crystal size. It can be observed that this effect is more pronounced
for nitrogen-functionalized GO containing electrodes.

Figure 2 X-ray diffraction pattern
of Ni, Ni-NrGOAPTES, and Ni-NrGONH3 catalysts.

It has been found in
the literature that graphene flakes serve
as heterogeneous nucleation sites for grain growth during the electrodeposition
process. This behavior has been attributed to the hybridization between
p-orbital of graphene and d-orbital of Ni,25 which improves the nucleation rate modifying the size of crystallites.26

On the other hand, the formation of (111)
planes in the nickel
film is always favored during the electrodeposition process because
they are the most stable crystalline planes. However, the incorporation
of NrGO in the Ni matrix produces a slight decrease of
the (111)/(200) ratio as it can be seen in Table 1. In Figure 2, a shift from diffraction peaks to higher angle values
with respect to the pure nickel electrode can be seen. It means that
the d-spacing decreases for the Ni-NrGO electrodes; however, this change is barely noticeable (around 0.01
Å).

Characterization of the structure and electronic properties
of
carbon-derived materials is usually performed through Raman spectroscopy
analysis. The spectra of freshly synthesized catalysts (Ni-NrGOAPTES and Ni-NrGONH3) are presented in Figure 3, together with the
spectra of different graphene additives and Ni-rGO electrodes. The
recording of spectra from different areas on the surface of each sample
did not show significant differences.

Figure 3 Raman spectra of freshly synthesized Ni-NrGONH3, Ni-NrGOAPTES, Ni-rGO,24 pristine GO, and nitrogenated GO (NrGONH3 and NGOAPTES) samples supported on a silicon
wafer.

All spectra from the electrodes
surface show the GO characteristic
bands, that is, G (first-order scattering of the E2g phonon
of sp2 C atoms) and D signals (the defect-induced breathing
mode of sp2 rings, which arises from C–C bond stretching,
and its intensity is related to the size of the in-plane sp2 domains).27 No spectroscopic signals
from nickel oxide or another surface species were observed, which
confirms the presence of GO particles incorporated in the structure
of nickel electrodeposits.

Spectroscopic parameters from the
nickel electrodeposited electrodes
and individual components of the hybrids are presented in Table 2. The wavenumber from
the D signal is practically constant at around 1327 cm–1 for all nitrogenated samples (particles and hybrids electrodes),
with the exception of Ni-rGO and GO particles with D
values at 1357 and 1349 cm–1, respectively. It is
clearly established that the presence of nitrogen atoms in the GO
particles produces a downshift of the D band, compared with pristine
GO flakes. Furthermore, the FWHMD is higher for ammonia-modified
electrodes.

The downshift of the G band wavenumber in Ni-NrGOAPTES and NGOAPTES samples is a feature that can be associated with the doping
concentration of the carbon network.28 On
the other side, it is known that the presence of N atoms in the GO
structure produces increase of D′ band intensity at ca. 1605
cm–1,29 which is the
case of Ni-NrGONH3 catalysts.

All spectra of N-containing samples
have values of the ID/IG ratio higher
than the same species without nitrogen, and the increase of ID/IG and FWHMG values confirms that nitrogen groups can be incorporated
in the hybrid material during the Ni electrodeposition process, being
able to produce structural changes which cause larger relative disorder.
Furthermore, the reduction of GO or NGO particles during the nickel
electrodeposition process is also evidenced by the increase of ID/IG values. In
fact, the observed increase of the ID/IG ratio can be attributed to the diminution
in the size of in-plane sp2 carbon domains because of the
nitrogen incorporation of N in the flake and simultaneous electroreduction
of GO. It means that the building higher amount of sp2 carbon
(graphite domains) compared with pristine GO flakes occurs during
the Ni-hybrid conformation.30,31

The largest values
of ID/IG ratios
are from Ni-NrGONH3 and NrGONH3, which are related to the amount
of defects that are introduced in the GO structure by:(i) Functionalization
with ammonia

(ii) Chemical
reduction of GO during the NrGO precursor synthesis,
and

(iii) Electrochemical
reduction of NrGO during nickel electrodeposition.



Surface elemental composition to reveal
the presence of nitrogen
atoms in the carbon network of GO particles in the nickel hybrids
was established by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements,
and the configuration of C–N bonding was analyzed through the
C 1s and N 1s spectra region from both electrodes. Figure 4A shows the complete XPS spectra
for Ni-NrGONH3 and Ni-NrGOAPTES, where
changes provided by the nitrogen presence in the nickel electrodeposits
are evident. Nickel in the metallic state is present on both the electrodes.
In particular, the area of the O 1s peak is much higher in the Ni-NrGONH3 electrode compared with Ni-NrGOAPTES, possibly because of the presence of a greater amount of oxygenated
defects in the reduced GO formed during the nitrogenation process.
This finding is consistent with Raman analysis, where that sample
presents an intensified D band.

Figure 4 (A) Complete XPS spectra, (B,B′)
C 1s zone, and (C,C′)
N 1s zone for Ni-NrGOAPTES and Ni-NrGONH3 catalysts, respectively.

The C 1s region in spectra (Figure 4B,C) of both electrodes is composed of four
components
assigned to the no-oxidized graphite carbon structure (284.8 eV),
hydroxyl (286.3 eV), epoxide (287.0 eV), and carboxyl groups (288.4
eV), with the normal composition from GO species. However, in our
case, the signal assigned to C–N binding at 285.6 eV has a
noticeable contribution in Ni-NrGONH3 and NrGONH3 electrodes. Associated to this evidence,
we note that the signal from epoxide binding (−C–O–C−)
has negligible intensity. These results are in agreement with Zhi
et al.,22 indicating that APTES functionalization
of GO particles occurs by amino terminal groups binding at the epoxide
sites on the basal plane of the GO structure. The presence of the
N 1s peak in Figure 4B′,C′ is the specific evidence about N-doping of GO
particles, which form part of both nickel coatings. The high resolution
spectra of the N 1s region show three types of functional groups such
as N-pyridinic, N-pyrrolic, and N-graphitic at 398.3, 399.4, and 401.1
eV, respectively19,32,33

Data in Table 3 show
that integrated intensities (at. %) from components of C 1s peaks
are equivalent for both catalysts, which is consistent because the
GO concentration in both plating baths is the same. The percentage
of C or N atoms was established by calculus of the peak area for each
N-type species. It is well known that the quaternary nitrogen (graphitic
nitrogen) has a p-doping effect, while N pyridinic and N pyrrolic
contribute to the increase of the Fermi level (Ef) and DOS of graphene.34−36 Considering the distribution
of N 1s components observed (Table 3 and Figure 4C,C′), Ni-NrGOAPTES catalysts have 18.79% of N pyridinic, whereas the respective value
for Ni-NrGONH3 is only 2.83%. Furthermore, we note that both hybrid materials
have the highest N content as N pyrrolic species.

From the literature, it has also
been shown that N pyridinic structures
are the main groups that participate on the enhancement of the electrocatalytic
activity and energy storage efficiency.37 On the other side, the high values of specific capacitance and stability
of these hybrid materials indicate that they are suitable supercapacitors33 because the improvement of electrical conductivity
of N-doped graphene films is possible by the presence of N pyrrolic
groups.38 The N pyridinic groups are linked
to a vacant defect because of the localized pair of electrons, and
quaternary N groups are at dangling bonds of graphene.39

Catalytic Activity Analysis
Cyclic Voltammetry
with Freshly Synthesized Electrodes
Figure 5 shows the
potentiodynamic behavior of nickel Watts and the two Ni-NrGO synthesized catalysts recorded at 25 °C in 1.0 M KOH solution
with a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. Comparison of voltammetric
cycles between Ni-NrGOAPTES, Ni-NrGONH3, and Ni electrodes shows that the N-doped Ni catalysts
have the highest activity for HER. The current densities measured
at −1.5 V (vs SCE) for Ni-NrGOAPTES and Ni-rNGONH3 are 2.35 and 1.62 times higher than those for Ni electrodes,
respectively (Table 4). In both cases, the incorporation of nitrogen-rGO particles in
the freshly synthesized Ni-rGO matrix results in an increment
of the current density for HER. Similar behavior has been published
for hybrid electrodes based on nickel and nitrogenated-carbon materials
in acidic media.40,41 Furthermore, the Ni-NrGOAPTES catalyst shows a decrease (50 mV) in
the onset potential (OP) with respect to pure nickel electrodes, while Ni-NrGONH3 has OP values 100 mV higher.

b Aged catalysts.

The mechanism of the hydrogen generation
in the alkaline electrolyte
on nickel electrodes is based on the following three steps42,43      

The steps in this mechanism are based
on the adsorption and recombination
of H atoms on the nickel nuclei to form H2, so it considers
nickel as the only catalyst of the reaction, while any additive in
the structure of the hybrid electrode is taken as a modifying agent
of the nickel band structure and not as part of the hydrogen generation
reaction.44

Although each of the
steps has a different Tafel slope associated,
it is well known that Tafel slopes close to 120 mV dec–1 indicate that the Volmer electrode reaction with transference of
one electron is the rate-determining step in the mechanism for HER.45,46 The values calculated for Ni and Ni-NrGO electrodes
presented in Table 4 are higher than expected for the Volmer reaction. This is probably
due to the presence of coupled reactions such as the reduction of
oxygenated groups in the GO structure.

Furthermore, increased
catalytic activity of both NrGO-modified
nickel electrodes is clearly evidenced by the exchange current values,
which are for Ni-NrGO electrodes, 3–4 orders higher
than Ni catalysts according to the voltammetric analysis.

Chronoamperometry
for Short Ageing Treatment
The freshly
synthesized electrodes were subjected to a short ageing treatment
to evaluate their stability during the hydrogen production. A chronoamperometric
pulse at −1.5 V (vs SCE) in 1.0 M KOH solution was applied
during 4 h at 25 °C. The treatment simultaneously involves a
continuous rotation (at 900 rpm) of the electrode to remove the bubbles
from the surface. Figure 6 shows the current density evolution of the catalysts during
the ageing time. After 4 h, the current density decays to −1.56
A cm–2 for the pure Ni electrode, to −1.50
A cm–2 for Ni-NrGONH3, and to −3.60 A cm–2 for Ni-NrGOAPTES, the latter
being the catalyst that shows the best performance for hydrogen production,
around 130% higher than Ni and Ni-NrGONH3. The catalyst deactivation rate (δ)
was calculated using eq 1(47) 1  where je is the
extrapolated current density at the beginning of the polarization,
and the dj/dt slope is evaluated
from the linear decay at times higher to 4000 s (linear fit of the
current profile). Both nitrogenated graphene electrodes present a
lower deactivation rate than Ni (Table 4), and it is only 5% lower for Ni-NrGOAPTES and 25% for Ni-NrGONH3. Therefore, the hybrid
catalysts could have a longer useful half-life than pure nickel.

Figure 6 Chronoamperometric
profiles from the ageing treatment of the catalysts,
measured at −1.5 V (vs SCE) in 1.0 M KOH at 25 °C for
4 h.

The differences in the trends
found in the measurements of cyclic
voltammetry and chronoamperometry are due to the fact that in cyclic
voltammetry, each potential is swept for a very short time to analyze
the processes that occur on the electrode, such as the generation
of hydrogen, while in the chronoamperometric experiments, not only
the fast processes can be detected but also the slow ones which are
related to the ageing of the catalysts. For this reason, not necessarily,
the trends observed in one of the techniques will remain valid in
the other because they are analyzing temporarily different processes.48,49

Comparative analysis of the electrochemical characteristics
(potentiodynamic
behavior and electrical properties) of the hybrid material, before
and after the continuous hydrogen production (ageing treatment), can
be useful to understand the differences in their catalytic activity.

Characterization of Aged Electrodes
Table 4 also presents the electrochemical
parameters obtained from voltammograms of Figure 7 for aged electrodes. We can observe that
the OP for HER is the same as that for freshly synthesized electrodes.

Figure 7 Cyclic
voltammograms recorded at 25 °C and 10 mV s–1 scan rate recorded in 1.0 M KOH with (a) fresh (continuous line)
and (b) aged (dashed lines) Ni-NrGONH3 and Ni-NrGOAPTES catalysts.

For Ni-NrGONH3, 27% lower current density is obtained after the ageing
treatment, while for Ni-NrGOAPTES, 5% higher current density is found, indicating that the electrode
undergoes a slight activation. Calculated Tafel slopes (Table 4) only present a significant
change for the Ni-NrGONH3, where the decrease in b that
brings it closer to the value obtained for nickel Watts, is observed.
The opposite effect can be observed in the exchange current for the Ni-NrGONH3 with an increase of 2.52 times. These results show that the catalytic
activity for HER after ageing has the following order: Ni-NrGOAPTESa > Ni-NrGONH3a ≥ Nia electrodes.
Raman spectra are very useful to detect the presence of nickel hydroxide
on the surface, whose formation can occur during ageing and often
can be associated with the deactivation process of pure nickel electrodes.24 In Figure 8, the absence of nickel hydroxides50 and barely noticeable changes between fresh and aged synthesized
electrodes indicate high stability of the material.

(continuous lines) and aged (dashed lines) Ni-NrGOAPTES and Ni-NrGONH3 catalysts.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis
Armstrong
and Henderson have presented an equivalent circuit (denoted as AHEC)
that can be used to fit impedance data for HER on nickel electrodes
in alkaline medium.51 This includes two
semicircles in the complex plane of the Nyquist plot. For porous or
very rough electrodes, there is usually observed in the complex plane
remarkably flattened semicircles; for that reason, the addition of
a constant phase element (CPE) in the circuit is necessary because
of capacitance dispersion.52,53 The AHEC model modified
with a CPE (AHEC1CPE) describes a simple hydrogen evolution process,
usually found on polycrystalline Ni and some Ni-based porous electrodes.54,55

In Figure 9A, the Nyquist curves for nickel nitrogenated graphene catalysts
before and after ageing process, at 25 °C, are presented. Three
potentials were selected to examine the behavior during the HER: E1 = OP corresponding to each catalyst (−0.95
VSCE for Ni-NrGOAPTES and −1.10 VSCE for Ni-NrGONH3), E2 = (OP – 0.1) V, and E3 = (OP – 0.3) VSCE. At high frequency (HF) values,
the semicircle observed is related to the surface geometry, whereas
that recorded at low frequency (LF) can be referred to the charge-transfer
process. The behavior at HF is independent of the overpotential applied
but that at LF shows a strong dependence of this variable.53 On the other side, the decrease of the semicircle
diameters in the area of LF when the overpotential increases indicates
that the charge-transfer resistance decreases. Therefore, the catalytic
activity is higher and the production of hydrogen is greater.

In this work, several equivalent circuits which are shown
in Figure 9(56) were employed to fit the experimental data.
In the first
place, the well-known Randles (Rand) and modified Randles with CPE
(RandCPE) models were tested. However, a better fit of spectra was
obtained with the conventional AHEC, the modified AHEC with one or
two CPE (AHEC1CPE and AHEC2CPE, respectively), and with a model containing
2 CPE in series (2CPE).57 In those equivalent
circuits, R1 represents the solution resistance, C1 (in some cases
replaced by CPE1) means the electric double layer capacitor, R2 represents
the charge-transfer resistance, and CPE2 together with R3 are related
to the pores and surface roughness.

Considering χ2 as a setting parameter with values
lower than 0.01, a very good approximation to the experimental data
was obtained with AHEC1CPE, AHEC2CPE, 2CPE, and RandCPE for both Ni-NrGO catalysts. It is important to clarify that the Randles–CPE
model only adjusts the first semicircle, unlike the other models derived
from the Armstrong and Henderson model.

Table 5 shows the
fitting parameters obtained for electrocatalysts at 0.1 V from OP
potential and compares the models AHEC2CPE with RandCPE to evidence
the difference between a circuit that can describe the phenomena in
the HER reaction, with one that has the limitations described before.
Taking into account the AHEC2CPE model, the R2 (related with the charge-transference)
increases for the Ni-NrGONH3 after the ageing process, but for Ni-NrGOAPTES, this parameter shows a decrease. This
feature is in accordance with the potentiodynamic behavior in Figure 7, where the current
density for the ammonium-based electrode decreases showing deactivation,
and the APTES-based electrodes seem to show the opposite effect.

Conclusions
In this work, nitrogenated
graphene–nickel electrodes for
HER, synthesized under two different configurations, are presented.

Silanization of GO with APTES molecules allows the incorporation
of particles to the nickel coating, promoting the construction of Ni-NrGOAPTES electrodes with better
efficiency for hydrogen production. This means achieving 130% higher
current density than Ni-NrGONH3 or pure nickel electrodes. Another advantage
shown is the simplicity of the method to manufacture these catalysts
because it is possible to incorporate the nitrogen-GO particles by
making a slight modification to the Watts bath. The Ni-NrGONH3 electrodes show
a good behavior for HER, but the synthesis with heating and pressurization
steps in the hydrothermal method is more complex.

We have shown
that both NGO particles contain incorporated pyrrolic
nitrogen in the graphene structure, but Ni-NrGONH3 electrodes also have graphitic
nitrogen. Because both the surface roughness as well as the crystal
size and the proportions of crystalline active planes are similar,
the difference in the catalytic activity can be explained on the basis
of N-doping with the incorporated rGO particles, which also affects
the structure of the catalysts. The Ni-NrGOAPTES electrode shows a lower OP for HER, which results
in superior hydrogen production with lower energy consumption.

Raman measurements have evidenced the absence of nickel hydrides
and nickel hydroxides at Ni-NrGO electrodes, species
that are responsible for deactivation of pure nickel electrocatalysts.
This is reflected in the lower deactivation rates obtained during
the ageing process. Considering these characteristics, we can resume
that Ni-NrGOAPTES is a better
alternative than pure electrodeposited nickel, analyzed in a long-term
use because it has a higher hydrogen production with a promising longer
half-life.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Reagents
Nickel sulfate
(Anedra, PA grade),
nickel chloride (Merck, PA grade), boric acid (Merck, PA grade), ethanol
96% (Cicarelli, PA grade), hydrochloric acid 36.5–37% (Cicarelli,
PA grade), potassium hydroxide (Anedra RA reagent) APTES 99% (Sigma-Aldrich),
ammonium hydroxide 28–30% (J.T. Baker), and GO dispersion (Graphenea
Inc.) were used as received. All solutions were prepared with Milli-Q
water and degassed employing high purity N2 (Indura S.A.).

Graphene Nitrogenation
N-GO particles were synthesized
by two different methods. The “ammonium method” involves
a hydrothermal process to obtain NrGO. For this purpose, 80 mL of
ammonium hydroxide solution (30% w/w) was added to 20 mL of 0.08 g/L
GO dispersion under stirring for 1 h at 40 °C and then sonicated
for 30 min. The aqueous dispersion was settled in an autoclave for
the hydrothermal reaction at 220 °C during 24 h. In this step,
the GO flakes were doped with nitrogen and simultaneously reduced
to rGO. The final product was centrifuged to collect the nanomaterial NrGONH3.20

The second method is the silanization
of GO with APTES. In this case, 0.1 mL of APTES–toluene solution
(1% v/v) was added to 10 mL of 0.08 g/L GO dispersion at room temperature
and intensively stirred for 10 min. Residual APTES and toluene were
thoroughly rinsed with toluene and water for its removal, leaving
GO particles functionalized with APTES (NGOAPTES) in solution. This process is based on the direct
reaction of the APTES precursor with hydroxyl groups on the carbon
skeleton.58 Moreover, Xi et al. have shown
that the amine group of APTES reacts with epoxide
groups from GO; therefore, a moiety of GO could be considered as reduced.22

Both forms of hybrid particles contain
nitrogen in different structural
configurations. N-rGO particles have the nitrogen atoms
incorporated on the carbon positions in the planar mesh, while amino
groups from APTES are included as functional external groups.

Electrodeposition
of Nickel-Based Hybrids
A conventional
Watts bath for nickel plating was prepared by dissolution in water
of 25 g of boric acid (at 50 °C), 240 g of nickel sulfate hexahydrate,
and 25 g of nickel chloride hexahydrate. In order to prepare Ni-NrGONH3 catalysts, 10 mL of 0.08 g L–1NrGONH3 dispersion was
added to 40 mL of the Watts bath. For Ni-NrGOAPTES catalysts, the NGOAPTES dispersion was sonicated for 30 min to separate the NGO flakes,
and then 10 mL of NGOAPTES was
added to 40 mL of Watts bath.

The synthesis of both catalysts
was carried out by electrodeposition on a Ni polycrystalline electrode
(RC S.A. 99.9 purity), with 0.196 cm2 of exposed circular
area, which is mounted on a rotating disk electrode support (Pine
Research Inst.; Raleigh, NC). The nickel electrodes were polished
with 0.05 μm alumina, cleaned with ethanol, and pretreated with
consecutive immersion steps in KOH (1 M) and HCl (10% w/w) solutions
in order to clean the surface. Electrodeposition of both catalysts
were carried out in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, thermostated
at 50 °C using a massive nickel counter electrode with a high
surface area. During the process, the homogeneity of the electrodeposits
was controlled maintaining the working electrode at a rotation rate
of 1600 rpm.

The current density applied during the synthesis
was −0.05
A cm–2 for 1800 s in order to obtain a deposit thickness
of around 30 μm. During the electrodeposition of both catalysts,
the potential-time transient reached a value of around −5.0
V, which indicates that the codeposited GO flakes should be in a reduced
state condition where the graphene is highly conductive.59 After the synthesis, the electrodes were washed
repeatedly with Milli-Q water in order to remove the remainder of
the plating bath from the electrode surface.

Catalysts Characterization
SEM images were taken with
a Supra 40 FE-SEM Sigma (Zeiss Company) with an acceleration voltage
of 5 kV and filament current of 10 mA.

Raman spectra of the
electrode surface were acquired with a LABRAM-HR 800, HORIBA Jobin-Yvon
Raman microscope with a 100× objective lens (NA = 0.9). The laser
excitation used was 633 nm at 3.5 mW. The instrument allows recording
spectra with a resolution of 1.5 cm–1. The illuminated
area in all Raman experiments was 1.0 μm2. At least
five different zones on each sample were analyzed to confirm the homogeneity
of the catalysts.

X-ray diffractograms were measured using λ
= 1.5406 Å
Cu Kα radiation employing a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer
operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, in the θ–2θ Bragg–Brentano
geometry. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The
2θ range used was 10–70°, with 0.02° steps
and counting time of 2 s per step. The Rietveld method was used to
refine the crystal structure employing the FullProf program.60 A pseudo-Voigt shape function was used to fit
the experimental data. The data refined were lattice parameters, atomic
positions, isotropic thermal parameters, peak shape, and occupation
factors.

The XPS analysis was performed in a Multitechnique
Specs system
with a dual X-ray source (Mg/Al) and a hemi-spherical analyzer PHOIBOS
150 in the fixed analyzer transmission mode. The spectra were recorded
with 30 eV step energy, with Mg anode. The working power was 80 W.
The pressure during the measurement was less than 2 × 10–8 mbar. The electrodes were subjected to ultrahigh
vacuum for at least 12 h before measurements. The XPS spectra analysis
was carried out using the XPS peak 4.1 fitting program.

Confocal
microscopy images were obtained using Olympus LEXT OLS4000,
employing a 405 nm wavelength laser, magnifications of 1070×
and 2132×, with a pitch in the z axis of 0.05
and 0.01 μm with areas for data collection of (258 μm)2 and (130 μm)2, respectively. Data from confocal
microscopy images were employed to determine rms values of the surfaces.

Electrocatalytic Activity Studies
Evaluation of the
electrocatalytic activity with synthesized electrodes was performed
by recording the voltammetric current for HER in 1 M KOH. The experiments
were carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped
with a thermostatic jacket. During the entire electrochemical measurements,
a high purity N2 flux was maintained over the electrolyte
surface to deoxygenate the solution. A large area platinum foil was
used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)
as the reference electrode (0.243 V vs RHE). The temperature of the
electrochemical cell was 25 °C using a Lauda Alpha RA 8 controller.
On the other hand, the reference electrode was kept at room temperature
by maintaining it out of the electrochemical cell and the circuit
was closed using a Luggin capillary.

An Autolab PGStat30 potentiostat/galvanostat
coupled to a FRA2 module was employed. The uncompensated ohmic drop
correction was conducted as presented elsewhere.57 The area used for all current densities calculation was
0.196 cm2 (the geometric area of the disk electrode). The
potential was scanned between 0.1 and −1.5 V (vs SCE) at a
scan rate of 10 mV·s–1 for all electrodes.
EIS analysis of the catalysts was performed in the frequency range
between 10 mHz and 100 kHz with a 10 mV bias potential. EIS was recorded
at different electrode potentials: E1 (open
circuit potential, OCP), E2 (HER, OP), E3, and E4 (100 and
300 mV more cathodic than the corresponding OP of each catalyst, respectively),
in order to cover the potential range where the HER occurs. The ZView
3.3 software (Scribner Associates, Inc.) was used for data fit with
the equivalent circuit models.

Analysis of electrodes stability
was performed keeping them in
continuous hydrogen production by applying a potential pulse of −1.5
V (vs SCE) during 4 h at 298 K in 1 M KOH. The chronoamperometric
profiles were recorded in order to study the surface changes after
the short ageing process. A 900 rpm electrode rotation rate was used
for EIS and chronoamperometric experiments. This is to prevent blocking
of surface sites with hydrogen bubbles.
