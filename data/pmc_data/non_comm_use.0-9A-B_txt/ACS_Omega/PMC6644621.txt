In the aim to obtain parahydrophobic
materials (both high contact angles and high hysteresis) for possible
applications in water harvesting systems, we report the synthesis
of novel 3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole (EDOP) and 3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole
(ProDOP) monomers with aromatic rings on the 3,4-alkylenedioxy bridge
and the resulting conducting polymer films were prepared by electropolymerization.
We show that the surface properties can be tuned by the nature of
the aromatic ring (phenyl, biphenyl, diphenyl, naphthalene, fluorene,
and pyrene) and the polymerizable core (EDOP or ProDOP). The best
results are obtained with both EDOP and diphenyl, with which extremely
high hydrophobic properties (up to 116°) are obtained, even if
the polymers are intrinsically hydrophilic. These surfaces could be
applied in the future, for example, in water harvesting systems or
in water/oil separation membranes. The synthesis strategy is extremely
interesting, and many other molecules will be envisaged in the future.

1 Introduction
Controlling
the surface wettability is fundamental for various applications in
self-cleaning surfaces, oil/water separation membranes, and sensors
or in microfluidics.1−4 Inspired by natural surfaces, the surface hydrophobicity is depending
on both the surface energy and the surface roughness and morphology.5−8 Indeed, in nature, we can found species with various wetting properties.
Superhydrophobic properties, characterized by both high contact angles
and low hysteresis, are present in lotus leaves, cicada wings, or
water strider’s legs.5,6 In opposite, parahydrophobic
properties, characterized by both high contact angles and high hysteresis,
are present in rose petals or gecko foot.2,7,8 The processes to create structured surfaces
are numerous and imply different treatments (chemical, physical, mechanical...)
such as etching, plasma, laser, lithography, or templating.9−14

Following the used process, conducting polymers can form nanostructured
materials.15−18 This is possible not only in solution by self-assembly but also
directly on surfaces inducing a high influence of the surface properties.
The electropolymerization was revealed as a very interesting process
because of an easy and fast control of the surface structures using
various electrochemical parameters.19−23 In this process, a monomer is oxidized to form conducting
polymers onto conductive substrates that are used as a working electrode
such as gold, platinum, titanium, stainless steel, or indium tin oxide,
whatever the surface geometry is (flat substrates, textured substrates,
meshes, fabrics...). In this process, the monomer also plays a key
role not only in the polymerization but also in the control of the
surface morphology and wettability. Among the multiple possibilities,
monomers of the 3,4-alkylenedioxypyrrole family such as 3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole
(EDOP) and 3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole (ProDOP) are exceptional monomers
because of their ultralow exceptional potential, leading to polymers
with unique optoelectronic properties.24−30 Reynolds et al. were the first to report their substitution not
only on the nitrogen but also on the bridge, leading to numerous synthesis
possibilities.25−28 However, the substitution on the bridge needs the synthesis of each
monomer in about eight steps. Moreover, the authors reported their
exceptional optoelectronic properties including high conductivity,
multicolor cathodic and anodic electrochromism, and rapid redox switching,
but their surface morphology and hydrophobicity were not investigated.

Previously, it was found a way to obtain EDOP and ProDOP derivatives
with hydroxyl groups on the bridge using epibromohydrin.31 These monomers could be easily functionalized
by simple esterification reaction. Thanks to the presence of NH groups,
superhydrophobic nanofibers were obtained with fluorinated chains.

Here, for applications in water harvesting systems, we want to
develop structured materials with parahydrophobic properties. Such
materials are extremely interesting to collect water droplets even
in arid or hot environments. For these applications, it is preferable
to use substituents of lower hydrophobicity than fluorinated chains
such as aromatic rings. Hence, we wanted to develop original EDOP
and ProDOP monomers with various aromatic rings (Scheme 1). The resulting surfaces were
investigated in order to determine significant effects on the surface
morphology and wettability.

Paper
2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrochemical Synthesis
Electrodepositions were performed in anhydrous acetonitrile containing
0.1 M Bu4NClO4 and 0.01 M monomer. The monomer
oxidation potential was found to be between 0.96 and 1.12 V following
the monomer used.

Then, it was very important to study the polymer
growth by cyclic voltammetry because this technique gives extremely
important information. It is known that the substituents induce steric
hindrance during polymerization affecting both the polymer chain length
and the resulting surface morphology. The substituent can also affect
the polymerization capacity of the monomers by electrowithdrawing/electrodonating
effects, but in our case, this is not the case because the substituents
are sufficiently separated from the monomer. Indeed, the conductivity
should be the highest in electrodeposition and the polymer insolubility.
For example, the conductivity is affected by both the length of the
polymer chain (different if we choose EDOP or ProDOP) and the presence
of the substituent. Hence, the polymer conductivity and insolubility
are very important if the polymer oxidation potential is very far
from that of the monomer, and the intensity of its peak constantly
increases after each scan without shift in potential.

The cyclic
voltammograms are given in Figures 1 and 2. In the case of ProDOT
derivatives (Figure 1), the voltammograms displayed superposed curves after each scan,
indicating that the growth is homogeneous when the thickness increases,
whatever the substitutes used here. Shifts to the high potentials
are however observed with ProDOT-diPh, ProDOT-Fluo, and ProDOP-Py,
indicating a significant steric hindrance. Moreover, using ProDOP
derivatives, the polymer oxidation potentials [between −0.5
and 0 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)] are very far from the
monomer oxidation potentials, indicating of extremely long polymer
chain length. This parameter is extremely important in electropolymerization
because the polymer insolubility increases when the polymer chain
lengths. Moreover, differences in the polymer chain lengths can also change
the resulting surface morphology. In the case of the EDOP derivatives
(Figure 2), the substituents
induce much higher steric hindrance. Only, EDOP-Ph and EDOP-Fluo display
superposed curves after each scan.

First of all, the surfaces are not extremely rough (Tables 1 and 2), as obtained with EDOT or ProDOT derivatives. This is in agreement
with previous works, in which the authors show that one of the main
factors influencing on the surface morphology is the solubility of
the oligomers formed in the first instances of the polymerization.32 The presence of NH groups induces, here, a high
increase in the polymer solubility reducing the surface structurations.

However, some of the polymer films are nanoporous. This is the
case of the films obtained with ProDOP-Ph, ProDOP-BiPh, and EDOP-diPh,
whereas others are nanostructured such as the films obtained with
ProDOP-Na, EDOP-BiPh, EDOP-Na, and EDOP-Fluo. The presence of nanostructure/nanoporosity
is very important and can induce an important increase in the surface
hydrophobicity. Indeed, at low deposition charge, all of the surfaces
are hydrophilic, indicating that all of these polymers are intrinsically
hydrophilic. This is not surprising because of the high polarity of
the NH groups, whereas the aromatic substituents are not very apolar,
compare the linear alkyl or fluorinated chains. The highest hydrophobicity
up to about 116° is obtained with EDOP-diPh at 400 mC cm–2 (Figure 5), for which the surface was both nanoporous and with a high
surface roughness (Ra > 500 nm). This
increase is not possible using the Wenzel equation (cos θ = r cos θY where r is a roughness parameter) because the surface roughness
would increase the surface hydrophilicity.33 Indeed, the Wenzel equation describes the case where the water droplet
enters in all surface roughness leading to a full solid–liquid
interface. With this equation, it is possible to increase θ
but only if the contact angle of the smooth surface (θY) is above 90° (intrinsically hydrophobic).

Figure 5 Example
of contact angle measured on PEDOP-diPh with a deposition charge of
400 mC cm–2.

Only the Cassie–Baxter can explain these results,
indicating the presence of air between the surface and the water droplet.34 The Cassie–Baxter equation is cos θ
= rff cos θY + f – 1, where rf is the roughness ratio of the substrate wetted
by the liquid, f is the solid fraction, and (1 –
f) is the air fraction. Indeed, because of the presence of surface
nanoporosity, air is trapped between the surface and the water droplet
leading to an increase in θ even if the polymer is intrinsically
hydrophilic. As a consequence, these states are intermediate states
between “the Wenzel” and “Cassie–Baxter
states”. Moreover, there is absolutely no direct link between
the roughness and wettability. There is a link between the roughness
parameter “r”, which is different from
the surface roughness (Ra or Rq), but only if the surfaces are in the “Wenzel
state”. This is not the case here because of the presence of
air trapped between the surface and the water droplet.

It should
also be noticed that compared to previous works on PEDOP or ProDOP
polymers substituted on the bridge, the results with linear or branched
alkyl chains gave higher parahydrophobic properties because of the
possible formation of long nanofibers structures, depending on their
length.19,30

3 Conclusions
Here, in the aim to prepare parahydrophobic materials (both high
contact angles and high hysteresis), we investigated the electropolymerization
of novel EDOP and ProDOP monomers with aromatic rings on the 3,4-alkylenedioxy
bridge and studied their surface morphology and wettability. We demonstrated
the influence of the nature of the aromatic ring (phenyl, biphenyl,
diphenyl, naphthalene, fluorene, and pyrene) and the polymerizable
core (EDOP or ProDOP) on the surface properties. The best results
were obtained with both EDOP and diphenyl, with which extremely high
hydrophobic properties (up to 116°) are obtained, even if the
polymers are intrinsically hydrophilic. The synthesis strategy is
extremely interesting and will open new lead to investigating many
other molecules. Moreover, these surfaces could be excellent candidates
in the future, for example, in water harvesting systems and in water/oil
separation membranes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Monomer Synthesis and Characterization
For the monomer
synthesis, the key molecules were ProDOP-OH and EDOP-OH as shown in Scheme 2. These intermediates
were obtained in eight steps from iminodiacetic acid, as reported
in the literature.31 Indeed, from intermediate 1, it is possible to obtain and separate the EDOP and ProDOP
derivates thanks to epibromohydrin, following by nitrogen deprotection,
saponification, and decarboxylation.

Scheme 2 Synthesis Way to
the Monomers
Then, the substituents
were grafted by simple esterification reaction. All of the acids used
here were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For that, 1.2 equiv of the
corresponding acid, 0.31 g of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (0.0015 mol, 1.2 equiv),
and 20 mg of N,N-dimethylaminopyridine
were added to 20 mL of absolute dichloromethane. After 30 min at room
temperature, the mixture was added to 20 mL of absolute acetonitrile
containing 0.2 g of ProDOP-OH or EDOP-OH (0.0013 mol, 1 equiv). After
stirring for 24 h at room temperature, the products were purified
by column chromatography using tetrahydrofuran/petroleum ether 60:40
as an eluent. Here, it was also extremely important to add 10% of
triethylamine in the silica gel and in the eluent because of the product
sensitivity.

4.2 Electropolymerization
The depositions were performed using an Autolab potentiostat of
Metrohm. Three electrodes were used to connect an electrochemical
cell to the potentiostat. A glassy carbon rod was used as a counter-electrode,
and a SCE was used as the reference electrode. As the working electrode,
a platinum tip (surface = 3.14 mm2) was first used in order
to study electropolymerization, whereas 2 cm2 Au-coated
Si wafers were used for surface characterization. The Au-coated Si
wafers were placed opposite to the counter electrode with a distance
of about 2 cm, whereas the reference electrode was placed anywhere.

Ten milliliters of anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) and 0.01 M monomer was
inserted inside the electrochemical cell. The solution was degassed
under argon before each experiment.

4.3 Surface
Characterization
The surface morphology was investigated
by SEM. A 6700F microscope of JEOL was used. For the surface wetting
properties, a DSA30 goniometer of Krüss was used. For that
2 μL water droplets were placed on the surface and the apparent
contact angles were taken at the triple point. The arithmetic (Ra) and quadratic (Rq) surface roughness were determined with a WYKO NT1100 optical profiling
system from Bruker. For that these measurements were realized with
the working mode high mag phase-shift interference, the objective
50×, and the field of view 0.5×. Each data given in the
paper is a mean of five measurements. The measurements were not determined
at the edge of the plates because of differences in the polymer growth
observed here.
