Nonsmall-cell lung
cancer is a severe disease with high morbidity
and mortality. However, the systemic administration of anticancer
drugs generally leads to serious toxicity and low anti-lung cancer
efficiency because of very limited drug distribution in the lung.
In our previous research, we have confirmed the high anti-lung cancer
effect of inhalable oridonin microparticles in spite of their long
and complicated preparation process. Here, we develop a novel, simple,
and quick method for preparing inhalable oridonin-loaded poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA)
porous microspheres using the electrospraying technique. The formulation
and preparation processes were screened. The electrospraying porous
microspheres (EPMs) were rough, porous, and suitable for pulmonary
delivery. Most of the oridonin was released from the EPMs within 20
h based on drug diffusion and via PLGA erosion. The EPMs exhibited
efficient lung deposition in vitro and in vivo because of their ideal
aerodynamic diameters. Chemical carcinogens were used to prepare primary
lung cancer rat models by direct pulmonary delivery. The EPMs showed
high anti-lung cancer effect after pulmonary delivery according to
CT images and pathology. Inhibition of angiogenesis and enhancement
of lung cancer cell apoptosis could be the major anticancer mechanism.
Electrospraying is an efficient method for the preparation of inhalable
drug-loaded porous microspheres. The oridonin-loaded EPMs are promising
dry powder inhalers for the local therapy of primary lung cancer.

Introduction
Nonsmall-cell lung
cancer is a severe disease, accounting for about
80–85% of all lung cancers, which readily metastasizes, and
the prognosis is relatively poor (approximately 85% mortality within
5 years).1,2 Currently, the systematic administration
of chemotherapeutic drugs is still the major treatment of lung cancer
despite high side effects and insufficient drug exposure to the lungs.
The direct pulmonary delivery of anticancer drugs could be an effective
way for lung cancer therapy. It enables high doses of chemotherapeutics
in the lung tumors, avoids the severe adverse side effects of systemic
administration,3−5 and enhances patient compliance compared with intravenous
injection6 because patients can self-medicate
the anticancer agents. However, up to now, a local therapy for primary
lung cancer is still absent. Therefore, it is necessary to find a
highly effective local therapy. Oridonin, an active diterpenoid isolated
from a traditional Chinese medicine Isodon rubescens (Hemsl) Hara, shows strong anticancer
effect with little adverse reaction, attracting great attention from
oncologists and pharmacologists.7

Inhalable porous microspheres, characterized by the particles of
low mass density and large sizes, enable highly efficient delivery
of inhaled drugs deep into the lungs and high respirable fractions
of inhaled therapeutics. The key role of these large particles is
to avoid being phagocytized by alveolar macrophages because of their
large geometric sizes. The deposited particles have an opportunity
to release entrapped drugs to the surroundings.8,9 Porous
microspheres can be fabricated with the methods of solvent evaporation,10 spray drying,11 and
supercritical fluid technology.12 However,
these methods have disadvantages such as low encapsulation efficiency,
difficulty in removing organic solvents, and of separation particles
from the aqueous phase. In our previous research, we prepared oridonin-loaded
porous microparticles for the treatment of lung cancer after pulmonary
delivery, and the high anti-lung cancer effect of the treatment was
confirmed.13 However, the preparation process
was long and complicated. Moreover, residual organic solvents could
be avoided in the preparation.

Electrospraying is an attractive
technique for generating particles
on the nano- and microscales and has recently gained interest for
pharmaceutical purposes. It works on the principle of applied electric
fields. The high applied voltage generates an electrostatic force
inside of the liquid droplet, which counteracts with the surface tension
of the liquid droplet. A Taylor cone of the liquid is formed at the
tip of the needle. According to Coulomb’s repulsion of charges,
the highly charged liquid droplets are sprayed and evaporated or coagulated
in the air. The formed particles are collected on the collector plate.
The droplet size can be precisely controlled by regulating both the
flow rate and the applied voltage. In practice, the electrospraying
technique enables better control over the structure, size, and composition
of the particles compared with other traditional fabrication methods.14−16

Here, we develop inhalable drug-loaded electrospraying porous
microspheres
(EPMs) for the local therapy of primary lung cancer. The technique
is simple and fast without organic residual solvents. The formulation
and preparation method of EPMs are optimized. Drug release is investigated.
The high anticancer effect of EPMs on the primary lung cancer rat
models is confirmed.

Results and Discussion
Formulation and Preparation
Process of EPMs
According
to preliminary studies, we found that the preparation of EPMs needed
low voltage and long collection distance of the electrospinning instrument.
These two conditions may provide enough time for the components in
the electrosprayed solution to aggregate to microscale droplets based
on the interface tension. After the solvents in the droplets evaporated
in the air, the microspheres immediately formed. High applied voltage
and short collection distance resulted in strings of beads (Figure 1A,B). We primarily
selected 15 kV as the applied voltage and 20 cm as the collection
distance for the preparation of PLGA [poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic)acid] EPMs after electrospraying the W/O emulsions
consisting of 1.5% NH4HCO3 (pore-forming agent)
solution/2% PLGA-in-dichloromethylene (DCM) solution (containing 0.5%
Span 80 to stabilize emulsions) (5:1, v/v). Independent microspheres
were obtained on the collector aluminum foil (Figure 1C).

Figure 1 SEM images of PLGA EPMs prepared with different
applied voltages
and collection distances, including 20 kV/10 cm (A), 15 kV/15 cm (B),
and 15 kV/20 cm (C).

To obtain porous microspheres, pore-forming agents, such
as NH4HCO3, need to be added to the electrosprayed
polymer
solutions in advance. The surface morphologies of porous microspheres
mainly depend on the concentrations of PLGA solutions, NH4HCO3 aqueous solutions, and W/O ratios (Figure 2). When no pore-forming agents
were added, only smooth microspheres were obtained [Figure 2B(d),C(a)]. Too much of PLGA
(e.g., 15% PLGA in the solution) resulted in strings containing beads
[Figure 2A(d)]. Finally,
the optimal formulation of blank EPMs included 6% or 8% PLGA solution,
1.5% NH4HCO3 solution, and 1:10 W/O ratio.

Figure 2 SEM images
of the EPMs prepared with different formulations and
processes. (A) 1.5% NH4HCO3 solution, 1:3 W/O
ratio, and 2%, 6%, 8%, or 15% PLGA solution from (a) to (d). (B) 1.5%
NH4HCO3 solution, 6% PLGA solution, and the
W/O ratios of 1:3, 1:5, 1:10, and no water phase from (a) to (d).
(C) 8% PLGA solution, 1:10 W/O ratio, and 0%, 1.5%, 3%, or 4.5% NH4HCO3 solution from (a) to (d). Finally, the formulation
and process of C(b) is optimal.

Oridonin-loaded EPMs were also prepared by referring to the
above
optimal blank formulation and process. A different aspect was that
some fibers appeared and the size distribution became very wide when
8% PLGA solution was used (Figure 3). However, 6% PLGA solution resulted in uniform EPMs.
Hydrophobic oridonin may change the W/O ratio. In addition, some oridonin
nanocrystals could appear on the EPM surface. In summary, oridonin-loaded
EPMs were prepared with 15 kV electrospraying applied voltage, 20
cm collection distance, and 1:10 W/O emulsion of 1.5% NH4HCO3 aqueous solution/6% PLGA/0.6% oridonin/0.5% Span
80 solution in DCM. High oridonin encapsulation efficiency of 58.59
± 2.0% and drug loading efficiency of 5.86 ± 0.2% were achieved.

EPMs prepared with 6% PLGA solution (C) and blank EPMs (D).

Characteristics of Oridonin-Loaded
EPMs
Oridonin-loaded
EPMs were rough spheres with many nanopores on the surfaces according
to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 3C). The average geometric size of EPMs was
5.23 μm (D50) according to the laser
light scattering measurement. The tapped density of EPMs was very
small, only 0.15 ± 0.02 g/mL, which can be attributed to the
porous structures that were further evidenced in the next investigation
of EPM erosion. The porous structures of EPMs led to the small mass
mean aerodynamic diameter of 2.1 ± 0.1 μm. The flowability
of EPMs was good, with a small repose angle of 29.37 ± 6.6°.
On the basis of the appropriate aerodynamic diameter and good flowability,
EPMs had a high emitted dose of 67.9%, that is, a large proportion
of inhaled EPMs would deposit into the lung. Additionally, the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra showed that oridonin
adopted an amorphous form and high dispersion in the PLGA microsphere
matrix (Figures S1–S3).

High Lung Deposition
of EPMs
In vitro EPM distribution
in the lung was investigated using the Next Generation Impactor (NGI).
The fine particle fraction (FPF) of the oridonin-loaded EPMs was 19.1%,
higher than that (12%) of the traditional nonporous solid PLGA microspheres
(Figure S4). The 2D CT imaging further
showed the in vivo lung deposition of Cy7-loaded microspheres, wherein
the lung deposition of EPMs was much more than that of the solid microspheres
(Figure 4). More importantly,
most of the EPMs deposited in the deep sites of the lung according
to the images. By contrast, almost all of the solid microspheres deposited
on the upper trachea and bronchi (Figure 4), indicating low inhalation efficacy. High
lung deposition of EPMs should result from the porous structure and
appropriate aerodynamic diameter. Therefore, EPMs are good carriers
for the pulmonary delivery of drugs.

Figure 4 Lung deposition of microspheres shown
using CT 2D (A), 3D (B),
and lung tissue section images (C, 100×) after 2 h postrat pulmonary
delivery. The arrows in the images (C) show the deposited microspheres
in the lung tissues.

Rapid Release of Oridonin from EPMs
Oridonin rapidly
released in the early stage of the dissolution investigation. One
hour later, 46% of oridonin had been released, possibly resulting
from surface-adhered oridonin nanocrystals and rapid release of the
embedded oridonin through the exposed nanopores in EPMs (Figure 5). About 65% of oridonin
had been released after 24 h. The nanopores were formed after electrospraying
evaporation of NH4HCO3. A lot of inner pores
were exposed when the microspheres were eroded over 1 h (Figure 5A). By contrast,
the solid PLGA microspheres had no pores, so oridonin released slowly
(Figure 5). Therefore,
EPMs not only improve the deposition of microspheres in the lung but
also supply the nanopores as the drug-releasing routes.

Figure 5 Oridonin release
profiles from the EPMs and the related SEM images
of microspheres (A) and the release profiles from the solid PLGA microspheres
(B).

Large microspheres can avoid the
uptake of alveolar macrophages
that phagocytize nanoparticles but not microspheres.17 SEM images showed the sizes of EPMs decreasing to 1 μm
or less after 24 h of erosion (Figure 4), and most of the oridonin had released into the surroundings
and would go into lung cancer cells. Therefore, EPMs are excellent
pulmonary delivery carriers to transport drugs to the deep sites of
the lungs and rapidly release drugs into the surroundings. Furthermore,
the safety of PLGA EPMs may be ensured because of erosion, and the
final degradation product of PLGA is CO2.

High Anti-Lung
Cancer Effect of Oridonin-Loaded EPMs
In the lung cancer
rat models, a great amount of tumor nodes appeared
in the left lungs (Figure 6). The oridonin powder group had less tumor nodes than the
saline group. The gemcitabine group had few tumor nodes. Surprisingly,
the oridonin EPM group showed nearly no nodes. Therefore, the therapeutic
efficiency of oridonin-loaded EPMs could be better than gemcitabine,
which was the clinical first-line anticancer agent. The high anti-lung
cancer effect of oridonin-loaded EPMs should be attributed to the
high lung deposition of EPMs, rapid release of oridonin, and avoidance
of the uptake of macrophages. In the following study, the anti-lung
cancer mechanism of oridonin-loaded EPMs is explored and some advantages
are found.

Figure 6 Lung appearances (A) and CT images (B) of the primary lung cancer
rats treated with saline, oridonin powders, gemcitabine, and oridonin-loaded
EPMs via pulmonary delivery. The light points in the CT images indicate
tumor nodes.

Inhibition of Angiogenesis
Induced by Oridonin
Tumor
growth and metastasis require sufficient nutrients and oxygen via
angiogenesis.18 CD31, a membrane protein
on the surface of the endothelial cells of blood vessels, indicates
the growth prosperity of cancer. The saline group showed a great number
of CD31 expressions (Figure 7A). The oridonin powder and gemcitabine groups showed some
CD31 expressions (Figure 7B,C). However, very little CD31 was expressed in the oridonin-loaded
EPM group (Figure 7D). Therefore, the antiangiogenesis effect of oridonin may be one
of its anti-lung cancer mechanisms.

Figure 7 CD31 expressions in the primary lung cancer
tissues in rats after
treatment via pulmonary delivery. The arrows indicate CD31 expressions
shown as brown spots.

Apoptosis of Lung Cancer Cells Induced by Oridonin
Apoptosis
is a key mechanism by which chemotherapeutic agents induce
cytotoxic effects in cancer cells.19 In
this study, the apoptosis proportions of lung cancer cells are shown
after merging the images of DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase Biotin-dUTP nick
end labeling) staining (Figure 8). The saline group showed no apoptosis. The oridonin powder
group showed little apoptosis. The oridonin-loaded EPM group and the
gemcitabine group showed much apoptosis. Therefore, oridonin-loaded
EPMs showed a high lung cancer cellular apoptosis effect. The pathological
sections also exhibited histological results similar to the apoptosis
(Figure 8), wherein
the oridonin-loaded EPMs could attenuate the cell proliferation in
the pulmonary alveoli and small bronchus compared with the other groups.

lung tissues of rats with primary lung cancer after treatment via
pulmonary delivery. Apoptosis was indicated using TUNEL staining (100×).
The nuclei were shown using DAPI staining (100×). The merged
images of TUNEL and DAPI staining showed the proportions of apoptosis
in the lung cancer cells. H&E staining (100×) showed the
states of lung cancer cells.

Conclusions
Drug-loaded efficient lung inhalers are
very beneficial to the
local therapy of primary lung cancers. We designed a novel, simple,
and rapid electrospraying method to prepare drug-loaded porous microspheres,
that is, inhaled oridonin-loaded EPMs, for the local therapy of primary
lung cancer. The EPMs had a nanoporous structure and low tapping density,
resulting in appropriate aerodynamic diameters and high lung deposition,
that is, ideal lung inhalable particles. The outstanding advantage
of oridonin-loaded EPMs may be that oridonin had released to the surroundings
through nanoporous routes before alveolar macrophages could phagocytize
the eroded nanoporous PLGA microspheres. Therefore, oridonin had an
opportunity to enter the lung cancer cells. Our pharmacodynamic study
demonstrated that the oridonin-loaded PLGA EPMs had a high anti-lung
cancer effect following pulmonary delivery. An improvement in the
lung cancer cell apoptosis may be the major mechanism. Electrospraying
is an effective method for the preparation of inhalable drug-loaded
nanoporous microspheres. Oridonin-loaded PLGA EPMs are promising dry
powder inhalers for the local therapy of primary lung cancer.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Oridonin was obtained from Shaanxi Huike
Botanical Development Co., Ltd. (Shaanxi, China). PLGA [poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic)acid, lactide/glycolide,
75:25, mol/mol, MW, 10 kDa] was obtained from Jinan Daigang Biomaterial
Co., Ltd. (Shandong, China). Gemcitabine was used as a positive drug
and purchased from Hansoh Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China).
NH4HCO3 was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Cy7 was purchased from Fanbo Biochemicals
Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). All other chemicals and solvents were
of analytical grade or high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)
grade.

Animals
Male Wistar rats (4–6 weeks old, 180–220
g) were from Beijing Vital River Experimental Animal Technology Co.,
Ltd., China. The handling and surgical procedures of animals were
conducted strictly according to the Guiding Principles for the Use
of Laboratory Animals. All of the studies were conducted in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use
of laboratory animals. The animal experiments were approved by the
Animal Care Committee of Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine.
Lung tissues were excised after sacrifice. Humane care of the animals
was always done.

Formulation Screening of EPMs
EPMs
were prepared using
an emulsion/electrospraying method. A PLGA solution (2–15%)
in dichloromethane (DCM) containing 0.5% Span 80 was mixed with an
NH4HCO3 solution (1.5–4.5%). A water-in-oil
(W/O) emulsion was prepared following sonication with a probe-type
sonicator (HUP-100, Hengao Technology Development Co., Ltd., China)
at 70 W for 60 s in an ice bath. Oridonin-loaded EPMs were prepared
after oridonin was dissolved in the PLGA solution. The W/O emulsions
were sprayed from the nozzle (inner diameter 0.88 mm, outer diameter
1.27 mm) of the electrospraying equipment (SS-2535H, Beijing Ucalery
Technology Development Co., Ltd., China). An aluminum foil straightly
faced the nozzle as the collector. PLGA microspheres were collected
from the aluminum foil using a brush. Other conditions included room
temperature, a relative humidity of 30%, an applied voltage of +15
kV, a spray solution flow rate of 0.8 mL/h, and a distance of 20 cm
between the nozzle and the aluminum foil.

Characterization of Oridonin-Loaded
EPMs
The XRD method
was used to differentiate raw oridonin, PLGA, the physical mixture
of oridonin/PLGA(1:10, w/w), and the oridonin-loaded PLGA EPMs on
an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8-advance, Germany) with the θ
range from 5° to 50°. The thermal behavior of microparticles
was detected using a DSC Q2000 (TA instruments, USA) instrument at
a speed of 10 °C/min in the 30–300 °C range. The
volume diameters of powders were measured on the BT2001 particle size
analyzer (Bettersize Instruments Ltd., Dandong, China) based on the
laser light diffraction method. The surface morphologies of oridonin-loaded
PLGA EPMs were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800,
Hitachi, Japan). The microparticles were mounted on metal stubs with
an adhesive carbon tape, sputter-coated with gold, and examined under
the microscope at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The repose angle
(deg) of microparticles was measured using the funnel method. The
bulk density was calculated with the graduated flask method.

Measurements
of Drug Loading and Encapsulation Efficiencies
Oridonin-loaded
PLGA EPMs (10 mg) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, 1 mL) and then diluted 10-fold with the mobile phase of methanol/water
(60:40, v/v). The sample was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter
and analyzed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, USA) to determine oridonin. The determination was performed
on a Diamonsil C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Dikma
Technologies, China) with the column temperature at 25 °C. The
mobile phase was delivered at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection
wavelength was set at 239 nm, and the injection volume was 20 μL.
All measurements were performed in triplicates. Drug loading and entrapment
efficiencies were calculated with eqs 1 and 2, respectively. 1   2  

Lung Deposition Study
The in vitro deposition was determined
using an NGI (Copley Scientific Limited, UK) at an airflow rate of
60 L/min. The aerosolization performance of the ∼15 mg microparticles
that had been filled into a size 3# hard capsule was investigated
with a linker to the NGI. The FPF, emitted dose, and total recovery
were assessed. The powders collected in each stage were dissolved
in the mobile phase of methanol/water (60:40, v/v), and the solutions
were analyzed with HPLC.

In Vitro Release of Oridonin
Oridonin-loaded
EPMs (10
mg) were suspended in the simulated lung fluid (SLF, 10 mL) containing
0.02% Tween 80. The suspension was shaken at 160 rpm and 37 °C.
At the predetermined time points, an aliquot (1 mL) of suspensions
was withdrawn and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant
was filtered through 0.45 μm filters and analyzed with HPLC
(see the Supporting Information). Fresh
SLF of equal volume was supplemented to the suspension after pipetting.
The experiments were performed in triplicates. Additionally, the surface
morphologies of the microspheres at different time points were investigated
with SEM (S-4800, 10 kV, Hitachi, Japan).

Lung Deposition Measurement
of Microspheres
Cy7-loaded
EPMs were prepared as above and administered to the rat lung using
an insufflator (DP-4M, Penn-Century Inc., PA, USA) through the trachea
without anesthesia. To confirm the lung deposition of EPMs, the tissue
sections and the whole lungs were observed with a fluorescence microscopy
and an imaging station (IVIS Spectrum CT, PerkinElmer, USA), respectively.
Nonporous solid PLGA microspheres were prepared with the above-mentioned
electrospraying method without aqueous phases. Their lung deposition
efficiency was also investigated as the control.

Pharmacodynamic
Study
We prepared the primary lung
cancer rat models with the chemical induction method where 3-methylcholanthrene
(MCA) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN) were pulmonary-administered.20 Thirty days were allowed for the models to mature.
Twenty-four rats were equally divided into four groups. The rats with
lung cancer were administered saline (0.2 mL per rat) through the
airway using an intratracheal aerosolizer (IA-1B, Penn-Century Inc.,
PA, USA) once a week for 4 weeks. Oridonin powders (1 mg each rat)
and oridonin-loaded EPMs (20 mg each rat, containing 1 mg of oridonin)
were pulmonary administered to the lungs of the rats using the DP-4M
insufflator through the trachea without anesthesia once a week for
4 weeks. A gemcitabine (10 mg/mL) solution in saline was also sprayed
into the lungs of the rats using an intratracheal aerosolizer with
a dose of 0.1 mL each rat once a week for 4 weeks. The rats were sacrificed
after treatment for 31 days, that is, after 3 days following four
times of administration. The whole lung was observed with the imaging
station as above. The left lung was split into two parts. One was
frozen with liquid nitrogen followed by maintaining at −80
°C for biological measurement. The other was fixed in the 4%
paraformaldehyde solution followed by histopathological evaluation.

Immunohistochemistry
The sections of the left lung,
initially embedded in paraffin, were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and
microwave-heated for 15 min in the EDTA antigen retrieval solution
(pH 8.0). A 3% H2O2 solution was used to block
the endogenous peroxidase activity. The tissues were further blocked
with bovine serum albumin (BSA). The primary antibody of CD31 (Good
Bio, China) diluted with a 3% BSA solution was added to the above
tissues and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The sections were washed
with PBS three times. The secondary antibody of the primary antibody
was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by
interval PBS washing. The sections were immersed in the coloring substrate
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, 0.4 mg/mL, DAKO, USA) containing
0.003% H2O2 for 5 min, rinsed with water, counterstained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and cover slipped. The sections were
observed under a microscope.

Apoptosis Assay
The left lung was fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde
solution and embedded in paraffin. TUNEL (Roche, Switzerland) was
performed and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After being washed
with PBS, the sections were incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) for 10 min at room temperature to detect nucleoli. Images of
TUNEL and DAPI fluorescence were recorded using a fluorescent microscope.

Statistical Analysis
Student t tests
were used to determine significance. All error bars represent standard
deviations. The statistical difference was determined when p < 0.05, and the significant difference was defined
as p < 0.01.
