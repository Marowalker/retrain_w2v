The potential energy surface (PES)
of the C6H5 + NH2 reaction has been
investigated by using ab initio
CCSD(T)//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) calculations. The conventional transition-state
theory (TST) and the variable reaction coordinate-TST (VRC-TST) have
been used to predict the rate constants for the channels possessing
tight and barrierless transition states, respectively. The Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus/Master
equation (RRKM/ME) theory has been utilized to determine the pressure-dependent
rate constants for these reactions. The PES shows that the reaction
begins with an exothermic barrierless addition of NH2 to
C6H5 producing the vital intermediate state,
namely, aniline (C6H5NH2, IS1). Once
IS1 is generated, it can further isomerize to various intermediate
states, which can give rise to different products, including PR4 (4,5,6-trihydro-1-amino
phenyl + H2), PR5 (3,4,5,6-tetrahydro phenyl + NH3), PR6 (2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1-imidogen phenyl + H2), PR9
(3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1-imidogen phenyl + H2), and PR10 (2,5,6-trihydro-1-amino
phenyl + H2), of which the most stable product, PR5, was
formed by the most favorable channel going through the two advantageous
transition states T1/11 (−28.9 kcal/mol) and T11P5 (−21.5
kcal/mol). The calculated rate constants for the low-energy channel,
1.37 × 10–9 and 2.16 × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at T = 300, P = 1 Torr and T = 2000 K, P = 760 Torr, respectively,
show that the title reaction is almost pressure- and temperature-dependent.
The negative temperature-dependent rate coefficients can be expressed
in the modified Arrhenius form of k1 =
8.54 × 1013T–7.20 exp (−7.07 kcal·mol–1/RT) and k2 = 2.42 × 1015T–7.61 exp (−7.75
kcal·mol–1/RT) at 1 and 10
Torr, respectively, and in the temperature range of 300–2000
K. The forward and reverse rate coefficients as well as the high-pressure
equilibrium constants of the C6H5 + NH2 ↔ IS1 process were also predicted; their values revealed
that its kinetics do not depend on pressure at low temperature but
strongly depend on pressure at high temperature. Moreover, the predicted
formation enthalpies of reactants and the enthalpy changes of some
channels are in good agreement with the experimental results.

1 Introduction
The
phenyl radical, C6H5, has been known
to play a vital role in the pyrolysis and oxidation of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well as in soot formation in combustion
chemistry for many years.1−5 In extraterrestrial environments, some species such as benzene,
phenyl radical, and cyclo-C5H5 radicals have
been considered to be crucial reaction intermediates in the formation
of PAHs, as shown in several studies.1−3 In combustion conditions,
similarly, the formation of PAHs and soot particles is usually derived
from an aromatic compound like a benzene molecule or a phenyl radical.6 Because of the important function of C6H5 as mentioned above, there have been theoretical and
experimental investigations into its reaction with closed- and/or
open-shell species such as C2H2, C3H4, CH4, NO, O2, CH3,
etc. in different environments including the circumstellar envelopes
of carbon-rich stars, the interstellar medium, and the combustion
processes.7−25

Glassman25 and Bittner et al.13 reported that, at high temperatures, blocks
of soot particles in the combustion of hydrocarbons can be obtained
via the two reactions of C6H5 with C2H2 and O2, in which, if the C6H5 + nC2H2 → PAHs
reaction shows the polymerization process of phenyl radical, the C6H5 + O2 reaction shows the oxidization
of C6H5. The mechanisms, rate constants, and
branching ratios of these two reactions under distinct temperature
and pressure conditions were also investigated sufficiently to specify
the quantity of soot formed in combustion. Frenklach et al.4,5 proposed a sequential-addition mechanism of C2H2 to the phenyl radical to yield PAHs, which is the best chosen synthetic
way in interstellar and combustion chemistry instead of the old-fashioned
means based on the combination of C3H3 and C3H2 or C2H2 and C4Hx considered by most authors.26−30 The other reaction series involved in phenyl radical including C6H5 + H2, C6H5 +
CH3, C6H5 + CH4, C6H5 + NO, and C6H5 + CO have
been carried out theoretically and experimentally,30−37 which indicated that these reactions occurred quickly in combustion
conditions.

As far as we are aware, the mechanism and kinetics
of the reaction
between the C6H5 radical and the NH2 radical, at various temperatures and pressures, have not yet been
investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Due to the lack
of such qualitative and quantitative data, the reaction of C6H5 with NH2 should be researched fully and
carefully. Therefore, the PES characterizing the C6H5 + NH2 reaction has been theoretically figured
out in the present work. This reaction was not suggested earlier as
a possible source of PAH precursors, but it is an appropriate representative
of the layer of reactions of aromatic molecules with species with
a single electron. The PES of this reaction reveals that the energetically
most favorable reaction path yields 3,4,5,6-tetrahydro phenyl and
that this advantageous path is straightforward to approach with an
activated intermediate generated initially, even at very low temperatures
and/or pressures. This work, subsequently, has focused on the rate
constants of the energetically low-lying channel proceeding over this
PES by theoretical–kinetic analysis. The thermochemical parameters
denoted as enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and entropy changes of some
main channels involved in the system were also measured and were compared
to experimental data to determine the validity of the method used
in this calculation.

2 Computational Methods
The density functional theory (DFT) with the common B3LYP38−40 and M06-2×41−43 functionals in conjunction with the 6-311++G(3df,2p)44 and aug-cc-pVTZ45−47 basis sets, respectively,
was used to figure out the mechanism for the title reaction. In this
work, the geometries optimized by the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) method
were utilized for the establishment of the PES and the kinetic prediction.
The correlative parameters, including vibrational frequencies, moments
of inertia, and zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVE), were obtained
using the same method. All species in the system were classified based
on their vibrational analysis, of which the local minima such as reactants,
intermediates, and products all have positive frequencies, while each
saddle point like a transition state contains only one unreal frequency.
The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)48,49 predictions
were employed to verify the validity of transition states. The B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p)
relative energies of all points were then refined by the single-point
energy calculations using the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,2p)50 + ZPVEs level of theory. The ZPVE values were
corrected by a factor of 0.97.51 The Gaussian
16 software package52 was utilized to optimize
and compute single-point energies for all species in this system.

The rate coefficients for the energetically low-lying channel have
been predicted by employing the Variflex code53 and the Multiwell code54 depending on
the transition-state theory (TST),55 variable
reaction coordinate-TST (VRC-TST),56,57 and the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus
(RRKM) theory58 with Eckart tunneling corrections.59 The sum and density of state in the kinetic
model were estimated from the input data file containing the energy
barriers of the reaction path and the species’ parameters mentioned
above. The master equation60 involving
multistep vibrational energy transfer for the C6H5NH2 excited intermediate state was solved to obtain the
pressure- and temperature-dependent rate constants using the energy-dependent
microcanonical RRKM statistical rate constants, k(E).

The collisional frequency of the bath
gas (Ar in the present work)
and the intermediate states have been taken from references. In the
present study, the values of Lennard-Jones (L-J) of Ar are ε/kB = 113.50 K and σ = 3.465 Å,61 whereas the values of the intermediates are
σ = 5.923 Å and ε = 407.8 K.62 The average energy transferred per collision, ⟨ΔE⟩down = 400 cm–1, was
used for the standard form of the “exponential down”
model.63 A brief discussion of the rate
constant prediction is presented in Supporting Information (SI).

It can be seen from Table 2 that the predicted heats of
formation of some species C6H5, NH2, and C6H5NH2 at the CCSD(T)//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p)
level of theory
are 80.47, 44.05, and 20.26 kcal/mol, respectively, while the values
at the CCSD(T)//M06-2×/aug-cc-pVTZ level are 81.82, 42.43, and
20.29 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are in reasonable agreement
with the experimental results. Likewise, the heats of several reaction
paths creating IS1, PR4, PR5, PR6, PR9, and PR10 at the CCSD(T)//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p)
level of theory are −104.26, −16.13, −25.53,
5.35, 4.89, and −12.74 kcal/mol, respectively. Those values
at the CCSD(T)//M06-2×/aug-cc-pVTZ level are −103.96,
−14.34, −25.23, 7.71, 7.27, and −10.93 kcal/mol,
respectively. Both sets of results are in agreement with available
experimental data. In addition, the bond-dissociation energy for the
C6H5NH2 → C6H5 + NH2 process calculated in this work based on
the heats of formation of C6H5, NH2, and C6H5NH2 is 104.26 kcal/mol
at the CCSD(T)//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) level, which is in excellent
agreement with the experimental value, 104.21 ± 0.38 kcal/mol
(ref from NIST, webbook.nist.gov).

As shown in Figures 1 and S1, the first intermediate IS1 located
at −103 kcal/mol is the result of the additional reaction between
two reactants, which takes place without a well-defined transition
state. From IS1, there are various different subchannels created to
yield other intermediates or products (see Figure S1), of which some subchannels can be ignored because they
proceed via high-energy barriers of over 18 kcal/mol. In Figure 1, hence, we only
consider seven potential channels possessing low transition states.
Those channels go through two tight transition states before reaching
the products. The first path proceeds via transition states, T1/11
(−28.9 kcal/mol) and T11P5 (−21.5 kcal/mol), and stops
at the product PR5 [C6H4 (o-benzyne) + NH3] at −25.6 kcal/mol. The T1/11 transition
state connecting IS1 with IS11 (−31 kcal/mol) has only one
imaginary frequency of 1288i corresponding to an
H-shift from the ortho position to the −NH2 group
with a distance of 1.648 and 1.199 Å, respectively, which makes
the C–NH2 bond elongate from 1.395 Å in IS1
to 1.486 Å in IS11. Whereas the ∠C2C1C2 angle increases
nearly 11 °C, the ∠C1C2C3 angle decreases about 8 °C,
in which C2 and C3 denote the carbon atoms at ortho and meta positions,
respectively. It is worth noting that the structure of T1/11 has been
confirmed by IRC analysis with the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) method along
the forward direction from IS1 to IS11 as well as the reverse direction
from IS11 back to IS1 (see Figure S3).
These results reveal that T1/11 is the accurate transition state connecting
IS1 and IS11. Similarly, the T11P5 transition state connecting IS11
to the product PR5 also has only one imaginary frequency of 131.9617i relating to the dissociation of the C–NH3 bonding with a distance of 2.203 Å. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the reaction
path generating PR5 is the most favorable channel in terms of energy
compared to the others. Therefore, the process from the reactants
to PR5 contributes mainly to the overall rate constant of the title
reaction. The second path producing the product PR9 passes two transition
states T1/13 and T13P9, for which the transition state T1/13 connecting
IS1 with IS13 shows a transfer of a H atom from the NH2 group to the CH group at the ortho location. It may be noted that
IS13 can be easily produced because T1/13 lies at a fair depth below
the reactants about 26 kcal/mol; thus, an extremely enormous exothermicity
from the first step (reactants to IS1) can help IS1 easily cross T1/13.
Once IS13 is formed, it can be converted to product PR9 via T13P9;
this process needs plenty of energy to pass over the high barrier
of nearly 90 kcal/mol. In addition, the reaction path giving product
PR9 is an exothermic channel with 4.4 kcal/mol. This product, hence,
is guessed hardly to appear at room temperature. The product PR4 can
be established from two different paths; the first path goes through
two transition states such as T1/3 and T3P4, while the second path
occurs via T1/8 and T8P4. Both channels effortlessly pass transition
states T1/3 (−19 kcal/mol) and T1/8 (−16.9 kcal/mol)
at the early stages, but it is difficult to overcome high-energy barriers
T3P4 (∼15 kcal/mol) and T8P4 (∼20 kcal/mol) at the later
stages. Of these, T1/3 and T1/8 show a 2,3-H-shift and a 3,2-H-shift,
respectively, whereas T3P4 and T8P4 present two H2-abstractions
from para and ortho positions, respectively. Therefore, PR4 is also
considered to be difficult to form in normal conditions even though
the formation of PR4 from these two channels is exothermic by 16.7
kcal/mol. Similarly, the product PR10 was also created by two different
pathways: one passes through the transition states T1/10 and T10P10,
while the other one proceeds via the transition states T1/16 and T16P10. Figure 1 shows that if T1/10
describes a H-shift between meta and para locations yielding IS10
(−26.2 kcal/mol), T1/16 shows a reverse transfer of a H atom
from para to meta positions forming the intermediate state IS16 lying
under the reactants by 16.6 kcal/mol. The relative energy of T16P10
in the second channel is higher than the one of T10P10 in the first
channel by about 3 kcal/mol. The second channel is thus predicted
to donate less consideration to the PR10 product. However, both TSs
possess very high-energy barriers (see Figure 1); thus, the PR10 product is predicted to
be difficult to form in the low-temperature region. The overall exothermicity
of the reaction path resulting in the PR10 product is 13.4 kcal/mol.
It is worth noting that the PR5 product is the most stable one compared
to the others on the whole PES. Last but not least, the IS1 intermediate
state formed at the first step can also isomerize to the IS2 isomer,
which is located at −79.4 kcal/mol, via T1/2 with a 102 kcal/mol
energy barrier. The geometry of T1/2 in Figure 3 shows a very far H-shift from the NH2 group to the para-C atom at distances of
1.383 and 1.684 Å, respectively, which makes this process lose
more energy than others. The bimolecular products C6H4NH + H2 (denoted as PR6) with 5.0 kcal/mol of endothermicity
can be generated by eliminating a hydrogen molecule out of the IS2
geometry when it proceeds via the T2P6 transition state lying 8.4
kcal/mol above the entry point.

Briefly, many various products
can be formed through the addition
channel, as shown in Figure 1, in which, the channel going via transition structures T1/11
(−28.9 kcal/mol) and T11P5 (−21.5 kcal/mol) producing
PR5 is found to be dominant, while the others proceeding via T1/3
(−19 kcal/mol), T1/10 (−18.5 kcal/mol), T1/8 (−16.9
kcal/mol), T1/16 (−14.2 kcal/mol), and T1/2 (−0.8 kcal/mol)
forming PR4, PR6, PR9, and PR10 are less favorable. Accordingly, the
dominant reaction path yielding PR5 is expected to be kinetically
advantageous.

3.2 Rate Constant Calculations
The rate
constants for the title reaction have been calculated based on the
main PES shown in Figure 1. Many channels of the reaction, as discussed above, can be
overlooked due to their too high-energy barriers. Only one reaction
path proceeding via the two transition states T1/11 and T11P5 giving
rise to the product PR5 has been considered. For this reason, the
rate constants of the C6H5 + NH2 reaction
have been calculated relying on the channel as shown below  The rate constants
of the barrierless process,
C6H5 + NH2 → IS1, have been
determined by using the VRC-TST procedure with the Variflex code.53 The treatment of microvariational RRKM and the
Morse functional model64 have also been
utilized to estimate the minimum energy path (MEP) curve presented
as follows  where De is the
dissociation energy excluding the zero-point energy; r and re are the reaction coordinate and
equilibrium value of r; and β is the constant
derived from the fitted equation to the estimated MEP.

The computed
barrierless rate coefficients under the conditions of this study are
shown in Table S4 in the SI file and are
plotted in Figure 4. It is shown that the rate constants, at low temperatures (T ≤ 600 K), slightly increase and do not depend on
pressures. At high temperatures (T ≥ 700,
800, 900, 1000, 1100, and 1200 K at P = 1, 10, 100,
760, 7600, and 76 000 Torr, respectively), those values sharply
decrease and strongly depend on pressure.

Figure 4 Plots of predicted rate
constants for the C6H5 + NH2 →
C6H5NH2 process in the temperature
range of 300–2000 K at various
pressures of 1–76 000 Torr Ar.

The rate constants for the reverse process, C6H5NH2 → C6H5 + NH2, have also been computed with the RRKM theory under varying
T, P conditions. Similar to the forward process, this channel takes
place without a well-defined transition state; its rate constants
can thus be predicted with the VRC-TST approach based on the maximum
ΔG‡ criterion. The rate constants
predicted by solving the master equation using the Multiwell code54 for various Ar pressures between 1 and 76 000
Torr in the temperature range of 300–2000 K are given in Table S5 and Figure 5. As can be seen, the decomposition rate
constants quickly increase in the temperature range of 300 ≤ T ≤ 1100 K and gradually decrease when temperatures
surpass over 1200 K (at 1 Torr), 1300 K (at 10, 100, and 760 Torr),
and 1400 K (at 7600 and 76 000 Torr). Moreover, the equilibrium
constants at the high-pressure limit for the C6H5 + NH2 ↔ IS1 process have been calculated and are
shown in Table S4. These values drop sharply
as temperatures increase, e.g., K∞(equiv) = 1.18 × 1048 and 2.74 ×10–16 cm3 molecule–1 at 300 and 2000 K, respectively.

of predicted rate constants for the decomposition process,
C6H5NH2 → C6H5 + NH2, in the temperature range of 300–2000
K at various pressures of 1–76 000 Torr Ar.

The pressure- and temperature-dependent rate constants, k(T, P), for the C6H5 + NH2 → PR5 channel were determined by using the Multiwell program54 with the use of the Eckart tunneling effects59 under the same conditions as above. The calculated
results are presented in Table S6 and are
plotted in Figure 6. The modified Arrhenius equation with three parameters adequately
describes those data in the temperature range of 300–2000 K
at various pressures of Ar and can be given (in units of cm3 molecule–1 s–1) as follows            It is observed that the rate
constants for
the designated reaction channel shown in Table S6 and Figure 6 tend to gradually increase in the low-temperature regions (T ≤ 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 for k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, and k6, respectively). For instance,
the rate constants at T = 300, P = 1 Torr and T = 600 K, P = 1
Torr are 1.37 × 10–9 and 1.58 × 10–9 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, respectively. As the temperature increases (T > 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 at 1, 10, 100,
760,
7600, and 76 000 Torr, respectively), the rate coefficients
sharply decrease, e.g., the rate constants are 1.67 × 10–9 and 2.16 × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at T = 900 K, P = 760 Torr and T =
2000 K, P = 760 Torr, respectively. In addition,
it is found that the effect of pressure on the rate constants is negligible
at low and high temperatures (e.g., T ≤ 600
and T > 1700 K, cf. Figure 6) owing to higher-energy decomposition processes
and indirect isomerization/decomposition processes. In the temperature
range of 600–1700 K, the predicted rate coefficients positively
depend on pressure (e.g., at the same temperature, T = 1000 K, k1 = 8.61 × 10–10 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at P = 1 Torr, while k6 = 1.69 × 10–9 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at P = 76 000
Torr).

The rate coefficients at high-pressure
limit, k∞(T),
were also predicted and
are listed in Table S6 in the temperature
range of 300 ≤ T ≤ 2000 K. In this
situation, likewise, the rate constants slightly increase with an
increase of temperature from 300 to 1100 K and gradually decrease
at temperatures above 1200 K. At low temperature (T ≤ 600 K), as discussed above, k∞(T) is equal to ki (i = 1–6) (e.g., 1.37 × 10–9 at T = 300 K or 1.60 × 10–9 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at T = 600 K), while in the high-temperature region
(T ≥ 1500 K), the high-pressure limit rate
constant is much greater than the others in the range of pressure P = 1–76 000 Torr (e.g., at T = 2000 K, k1 = 2.10 × 10–11 vs k∞(T) = 1.52
× 10–9 cm3 molecule–1 s–1), as shown in Table S6.

The effects of the error margins of energy about ± 2
kcal/mol
estimated by the CCSD(T)//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) method on the rate
constants for the formation and dissociation of C6H5NH2 were also considered. The computed values in
various conditions are presented in Figures S7–S10 in the SI file. These results show that the rate constants for the
formation of C6H5NH2 remain almost
unchanged at low temperatures (T ≤ 1200 K)
but change quickly at high temperatures (T ≥
1300 K). At 2000 K and 760 Torr Ar, the value associated with a −101
kcal/mol energy of C6H5NH2 is 3.01
× 10–19 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, which is 4.97 × 10–19 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 at the energy of −103 kcal/mol, while the value at −105
kcal/mol energy increases by nearly 2 orders of magnitude in going
to 1.57 × 10–17 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 (see Tables S4, S7, and S9). In contrast, at low temperatures (T ≤ 1100 K), the rate constants for the decomposition
of C6H5NH2 → C6H5 + NH2 decrease according to the reduction
of the C6H5–NH2-binding energy
(BDE). However, at high temperatures (T ≥
1400 K), those values increase slightly when the BDE increases from
101 to 105 kcal/mol, as shown in Tables S5, S8, and S10.

4 Conclusions
The
mechanism and kinetics, as well as thermodynamics of the C6H5 + NH2 reaction, have been investigated
based on the quantum chemical theory. The B3LYP method in conjunction
with the basic set 6-311++G(3df,2p) has been employed to optimize
for the species related in this reaction, such as reactants, intermediate
states, transition states, and products. The high method CCSD(T) with
the same basic set above has also been utilized to calculate single-point
energies for all species on the potential energy surface.

The
mechanism of the title reaction at the entrance channel takes
place as the additional style without a well-defined transition state
to form the stable intermediate C6H5NH2 standing at 103 kcal/mol below the reactants. The most dominant
channel connecting IS1 with product PR5 proceeds via two different
transition states T1/11 and T11P5 lying 28.9 and 21.5 kcal/mol under
the reactants, respectively.

The predicted heats of formation
of several species (C6H5, NH2, C6H5NH2), as well as the heats of reaction
of some reaction paths producing
IS1, PR4, PR5, PR6, PR9, and PR10 at the CCSD(T)//B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p)
and CCSD(T)//M06-2×/aug-cc-pVTZ levels of theory are in agreement
with the available experimental data. Those results confirm that the
methods used in this work are reliable and the calculated energies
can be utilized to compute rate constants for the title reaction.

The predicted rate coefficients for the C6H5 + NH2 → PR5 channel in the pressure and temperature
ranges of 1–76 000 Torr and 300–2000 K, respectively,
reveal that its kinetics strongly depends on pressure and temperature,
i.e., the rate constants increase at low temperature and decrease
at high temperature. The association and dissociation rate constants
of the barrierless processes, C6H5 + NH2 → C6H5NH2 and C6H5NH2 → C6H5 + NH2, respectively, were nearly independent of pressure
at a low temperature and strongly dependent on pressure at a high
temperature. Observation of the C6H5 + NH2 = C6H5NH2 process showed
that there was a large negative temperature dependence of the high-pressure
limit equilibrium constants. The effects of the error margins of the
energy on the rate constants for the formation and dissociation of
C6H5NH2 were also considered. The
results show that the rate constants for the formation of C6H5NH2 remain almost unchanged at low temperatures
but change quickly at high temperatures. In contrast, at low temperatures,
the rate constants for the C6H5NH2 → C6H5 + NH2 decomposition
decrease according to the reduction of the C6H5–NH2 binding energy but slightly increase at high
temperatures.

The results in this study are very important to
understand the
mechanism and kinetics of the aromatic radical C6H5 with some small species such as NH2, CH3, etc. They will help researchers in working with various experiments
related to this species in the future.
