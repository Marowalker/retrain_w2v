Magnetic nanomaterials are promising heterogeneous catalysts for
environmental applications. According to X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, and vibrating-sample magnetometer, a kind of
copper-modified nanomagnetic material (Cu-nFe3O4) was successfully prepared by a one-step synthesis method. Among
them, compared with the two-step synthesis method of Cu/Fe3O4 and Cu/nFe3O4, Cu-nFe3O4 has the best effect on chlortetracycline (CTC) removal.
The batch study results indicate that the maximum removal of chlortetracycline
is 99.0% at a dosage = 2.0 g L–1, copper loading
= 0.8 mM, and C0 = 100 mg L–1 at the optimum conditions within 90 min. The effects of humic acids
(HA), NO3–, Cl–, CO32–, and PO43– on the CTC removal by Cu-nFe3O4 are also investigated.
Repeated experiments were performed on the prepared Cu-nFe3O4, indicating that Cu-nFe3O4 has
good recyclability. The kinetics of the Cu-nFe3O4 removal of CTC was investigated, indicating that the reaction conformed
to the double constant model and the reaction is mainly dominated
by a chemical reaction with physical adsorption. Finally, the mechanism
of the CTC removal by Cu-nFe3O4 in a heterogeneous
environment was clarified. This study aims to provide an experimental
basis for the environmental application of Cu-nFe3O4.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As an important magnetic material, magnetite (Fe3O4) has attracted much attention because of its unique characteristics.
It has also been widely used in the fields of batteries,1 sensors,2 targeted
drug delivery,3 catalysts,4 and data storage.5,6 The problem with magnetic
materials is that the particles interact with each other, thereby
forming large aggregates. However, if the size of the magnetic nanoparticles
is reduced to less than a few nanometers, they will become superparamagnetic.7 The particles will obtain a certain magnetization
when the magnetic field is applied; however, when the magnetic field
is removed, the long program will be lost because of the high thermal
energy, and the particles have no remanence.8

Small-sized nanoparticles have high specific surface area and reactivity,
which contribute to their interaction with a variety of chemicals.9 The immobilization of nano-Fe3O4 on organic or inorganic supports can prevent the agglomeration
of nano-Fe3O4, which is a promising heterogeneous
catalyst with potential applications. The removal of metals by nano-Fe3O4 has achieved a series of good results. Accordingly,
researchers have modified nano-Fe3O4 by polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA),10 silicon dioxide,11,12 carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin (CM-β-CD),13 and polyvinylimide (PVAm),14 such that the nano-Fe3O4 surface has abundant
functional groups to efficiently adsorb heavy-metal pollutants, such
as nickel(II), lead(II), mercury(II), copper(II), cobalt(II), chromium(VI),
or arsenic(V) in water.

Zeng et al.15 proposed a two-step synthesis
of iron-nitrogen codoped mesoporous carbon spheres to activate PMS
to remove organic pollutants in water. Due to the richness and unique
mesoporous structure of double heteroatom doping, in situ conversion
of porous Fe3O4 microspheres into macroporous
M-Fe/NC materials has greatly improved the catalytic performance of
PMS activation. Roto et al.11 synthesized a thiol-modified Fe3O4/SiO2 core–shell nanoparticle magnetic adsorbent
by a two-step method for chlorogold adsorption. The adsorption of
[AuCl4] ions by Fe3O4/SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles follows the Langmuir isotherm model,
and the maximum adsorption capacity is 115 mg/g. However, the reusability
of the composite needs to be considered. Xu and Wang16 prepared nano-Fe3O4/CeO2 magnetic
composites by a two-step synthesis method. The catalytic performance
of the nano-superparamagnetic nFe3O4/CeO2 composite for the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by hydrogen
peroxide was studied. Because the combination of Fe3O4 and CeO2 in the two-step process is not close
enough, the activity of the catalyst decreases greatly after six consecutive
runs. Further work is needed to reduce the loss of the active ingredients
of the catalyst.

Because of the unreliable synthesis of active ingredients and Fe3O4 by the two-step method, the active ingredients
combined with Fe3O4 will fall off due to hydraulic
and collision effects. The active substances of the modified Fe3O4 composites prepared by the two-step method are
easy to be lost, resulting in the rapid degradation of the properties
of the composites. The active material of the modified Fe3O4 composite prepared by the one-step method combines
with Fe3O4 more firmly, and the active ingredient
is not easy to fall off, thus prolonging the service life of the composite.
Moreover, the one-step process is simpler than the two-step process,
avoiding the waste of raw materials caused by too many processes,
and is more green and environmentally friendly.17 Composite materials have high catalytic activity for heterogeneous
Fenton degradation of bisphenol A and synergistic enhancement after
modification. Song et al.18 synthesized
chitosan-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles in one step
from Fe3O4 and chitosan chemically modified
with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lactic acid (LA). The nanoparticles
are stable and have no cytotoxicity and non-tissue toxicity. However,
the existing one-step method is suitable for the modification of Fe3O4 by organic (such as PMMA, CM-β-CD, PVAm,
PEG, and LA), graphene, and silicate. It is not suitable for the modification
of Fe3O4 by metal (especially copper, silver,
cobalt, nickel, etc.). This is mainly because the formation of Fe3O4 will be destroyed by copper, silver, cobalt,
and nickel ions in one-step synthesis, leading to the failure of composite
preparation.

In this paper, a feasible one-step method for doping metal to modify
nano-Fe3O4 is proposed, which not only does
not destroy the original structure of nano-Fe3O4 but also dredges the pore structure of nano-Fe3O4. At the same time, nano-Fe3O4 is firmly
loaded with metal and has a specific catalytic effect. This study
used chlortetracycline (CTC), one of the most representative tetracyclines,
as the target pollutant. At the same time, it made nano-Fe3O4 loaded with metal, which has a certain catalytic effect.
The nano-Fe3O4 modified by loading metal, dosage,
and influencing factors was investigated to treat CTC. This study
aims to develop more green and efficient antibiotic wastewater removal
materials.

Chengdu Aikeda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

2.2 Synthetic Method
Coprecipitation
is currently the most common method for preparing nano-Fe3O4 particles by adding a suitable precipitant to a salt
solution containing various metal ions to promote sufficient precipitation
and crystallization followed by precipitation. The particles were
dried or thermally decomposed to produce nanoparticles.19 The basic principle of this method is as follows: 1  

The basic steps of
preparation are as follows: 1.39 g of FeSO4·7H2O and 2.7 g of FeCl3·6H2O were
added to a 250 mL beaker. 100 mL of distilled water was added and
rapidly heated at 80 °C. 30 mL of concentrated ammonia water
was added at a slow rate. The solution gradually produced a black
solid and reacted at a constant temperature for 10 min. The solid
particles were washed several times with distilled water and ethanol.
The supernatant was then discarded and dried at room temperature for
5 h to prepare n nano-Fe3O4 particles, which were stored in the dryer.

The preparation one-step synthesis method for M-nFe3O4 is as follows: 1.39 g of FeSO4·7H2O and 2.7 g of FeCl3·6H2O were
added to a 250 mL beaker. 100 mL of distilled water was then added
and rapidly heated at 80 °C. 30 mL of concentrated ammonia water
was then added at a slow rate. The solution gradually produced a black
solid and reacted at a constant temperature for 5 min. Subsequently,
0.2–0.8 mM of M (metal) salt solution was quickly added to
the reaction solution, and the reaction was continued for 10 min.
The solid particles were washed several times with distilled water
and ethanol. Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded and dried
at room temperature for 5 h to prepare the n M-nFe3O4 particles stored in the dryer.

2.3 Analysis Method
A certain amount
of commercial Fe3O4, prepared nFe3O4, or M-nFe3O4 was added to a 250
mL conical flask. The initial concentration of the CTC solution was
50 mg L–1. The conical flask was put into a constant
temperature oscillator for continuous reaction at 25 °C and 200
rpm. The CTC concentration was measured by an ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometer after the 0.22 μm filter membrane was removed
at different times. The detection wavelength was 276 nm.20 The residual CTC concentration was used as the
measurement index to investigate the removal effect of the loaded
metal, loaded amount, dosage, and initial concentration of the pollutants
on CTC. Each experiment was parallel to three groups, and the mean
was taken.

The commercial Fe3O4, prepared
nFe3O4, and Cu-nFe3O4 were
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS, D8 Advance) using
copper–potassium alpha radiation (40 kV, 30 mA). The 2θ
range was 20–100°, and the scanning speed was 10°
min–1. The adsorption–desorption isotherm
of nitrogen was determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer
at a liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) over a relative pressure range
of 0 to 1. The specific surface area and pore structure characteristics
of the materials were analyzed using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, XL-30ESEM FEG FEI scanning electron
microscopy COMPANYTM) equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-max spectrometer
(EDS) for studying the chemical composition and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20) were used to observe the
nanomaterial morphology and size. Magnetism was assessed using a magnetic
measurement system (Squid-VSM, USA).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
compositional changes of the commercial Fe3O4, prepared nFe3O4, and 0.2–0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 were analyzed by XRD. Figure 1a1–a5 shows the XRD analysis of the
five magnetic materials. The six peaks located at 2θ = 30.1,
35.5, 43.1, 53.5, 57.0, and 62.6°, which were correspondingly
diffracted with (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) of Fe3O4, respectively, matched with the standard card
(JCPDS no 65-3107).21 No other diffraction
peaks were observed in Figure 1a, thereby ensuring a good purity of the samples with a cubic
inverse spinel structure. A comparison of the letter-to-background
ratios of the five XRD patterns in Figure 1 clearly shows that Figure 1a2–a5 had the lowest background ratio,
indicating that its crystallinity was poor. In contrast, Figure 1a1 had the highest
signal-to-background ratio, indicating its good crystallinity.22,23 The XRD peak widths of nFe3O4 and Cu-nFe3O4 prepared by the coprecipitation method were
higher than those of the commercial Fe3O4, may
be because of the non-crystalline structure properties of the nanomaterials
prepared by the coprecipitation method15,24 and the modification
with copper not changing the Fe3O4 composition.

of the commercial Fe3O4, prepared nFe3O4 0.2, 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4, and post-reaction
0.8 Cu-nFe3O4; (c–d) N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms of nFe3O4 and 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4.

The pore characteristics, surface area, and adsorption–desorption
measurements of the samples were investigated with nitrogen. As shown
in Figure 1b–d, Figures S1–S2, and Table 1, all samples showed a typical type-IV isotherm,
illustrating the mesoporous structure. In addition, the appearance
of H3 hysteresis loops indicated abundant mesopores in Cu-nFe3O4 after multiple reactions. The pore size distribution
of the three samples was calculated by the density functional theory
(DFT) method. As shown in Figure 1b–d, the micropores with a 1–2 nm diameter
were present in all samples, but the commercial Fe3O4 had very few mesopores (2–50 nm) and macropores (>50
nm), while the prepared nFe3O4 and Cu-nFe3O4 did not only have abundant micropores but also
had abundant mesopores and macropores. The mesopores were mainly concentrated
at 30 nm. The differential pore volume of nFe3O4 and Cu-nFe3O4 was mainly attributed to the
higher pores of 2–150 nm compared to the commercial Fe3O4, indicating that more mesopores and macropores
were formed in the material by precipitation and modification. As
shown in Table 1, compared
with the commercial Fe3O4 (2.54 m2 g–1), the BET surface area of nFe3O4 (73.84 m2 g–1), 0.2Cu-n Fe3O4 (76.33 m2 g–1),
0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 (73.28 m2 g–1), and post-reaction 0.8Cu-n Fe3O4 (83.72 m2 g–1) significantly increased. Moreover,
they were larger than nFe3O4 (55.72 m2 g–1)21 prepared by
the precipitation method and the surfactant-modified nFe3O4 (30.18 m2 g–1),25 indicating that the precipitation method and
the metal modification can improve the pore structure and the specific
surface area of nFe3O4. As shown in Figure S3, the specific surface area of the material
can be increased by this precipitation method, and the number of micropore
scan be further increased by metal modification. The specific surface
area increased and the micropore area sharply decreased after the
reaction, indicating that the reactive sites were mainly concentrated
in the micropore. Moreover, the specific surface area of the post-reaction
0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 after multiple reactions was 14.3%
larger than that of the 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 before
being unreacted, which is also strong proof that the multiple reaction
performance of the material is not reduced.

Figure 2a,b shows
the SEM photographs of the nFe3O4 nanoparticles
and the commercial Fe3O4 prepared by coprecipitation.
Both of them had the same morphology and octahedron with an edge length
of approximately 0.5–1.5 μm. According to the BET data,
the specific surface area of the prepared nFe3O4 (73.84 m2 g–1) was 28 times larger
than that of the commercial Fe3O4 (2.54 m2 g–1), indicating that an abundant pore
structure can be obtained during coprecipitation, and the specific
surface area of the material can be significantly increased. The morphology
of the 0.2 Cu-nFe3O4 and 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 nanoparticles prepared by the coprecipitation method
was changed (Figure 2c,d). The surface formed a loose porous structure. However, the particle size of the sample can be hardly determined
from the SEM photos. Therefore, HRTEM micrographs of the 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 were collected, as shown in Figure 4 and Figure S6. The particle sizes of the 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 nanoparticles prepared by coprecipitation were 15–20 nm.
The loose structure with holes can be clearly observed in the HRTEM
images of the single particles. The pore sizes were 20–50 nm.
The structure shown in Figure 2d was formed by stacking these nanoparticles. EDX element
mapping (Figure 3)
showed the presence of oxygen, iron, and copper onto 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4. These mapping images showed that iron and copper
were well dispersed throughout the sample. Approximately, 27.66 wt
% oxygen, 70.22 wt % iron, and 2.12 wt % copper were detected in the
sample through an elemental analysis. The atomic ratio of oxygen to
iron given in this conclusion is about 1.22 < 1.33 (4:3), which
indicates that the iron content on the surface of the material is
higher than that of oxygen, which indirectly proves that there may
be more reactive sites on the surface of the material.

The room-temperature hysteresis curve of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 was measured by a vibrating-sample magnetometer (Figure 5) and was found to
have room-temperature ferromagnetism. The saturation magnetization
(Ms) was 63.85 emu g–1. The magnetic
properties of the materials are generally affected by many factors,
such as size, structure, and morphology.25 As far as we know, the Ms value of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 was higher than those of many metal-modified
nFe3O4.16,17 In addition, almost
zero coercivity and remanence demonstrated the superparamagnetism
of the composite, which allowed the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles
to be separated from the solution using an applied magnetic field
while avoiding aggregation after removal of the applied magnetic field.17,22Figure 8f2,3 demonstrates
that, by applying an external magnetic field, the composite can be
easily separated and reused from the solution, which was a particularly
important advantage for nanoparticles. The magnetic properties make
them easily controlled by the external magnetic fields, which is important
for their application.16 A more detailed
research on magnetism is still in progress.

3.2 Comparison of One-Step and Two-Step Synthesis
As shown in Figure 6, nFe3O4 is obtained by the coprecipitation
method, Cu/Fe3O4 and Cu/nFe3O4 are obtained by a two-step method, and Cu-nFe3O4 is obtained by a one-step method. Here, we compare
the effects of different synthetic methods on CTC removal, as shown
in Figure 6d. It can
be seen that the removal efficiencies of Cu/Fe3O4 and Cu/nFe3O4 synthesized by a two-step method
are similar to those of Fe3O4 and nFe3O4 for 90 min, only 12.4 and 67.6%, respectively. This
indicates that the two-step metal modification has not made the catalytic
activities of Cu/Fe3O4 and Cu/nFe3O4 remarkable and thus cannot improve their removal efficiency
of CTC. Compared with Cu/Fe3O4 and Cu/nFe3O4, the removal of CTC by one-step modification
has improved significantly, reaching 89.2%. It shows that the one-step
synthesis of Cu-nFe3O4 can significantly enhance
the removal of CTC in water. This is mainly due to the larger specific
surface area and stronger reactivity of nanosized Cu-nFe3O4 than that of Cu/Fe3O4. One-step
synthesis of Cu-nFe3O4 has more active catalytic
sites than two-step synthesis of Cu/nFe3O4 and
has the characteristics of large specific surface area and strong
reactivity of nanomaterials.

3.3 Effect of Loading Metals
Precious,
transition, and rare-earth metals have excellent catalytic properties
because of their unique physical and chemical properties. In this
experiment, the one-step method was used to prepare different metal
elements (i.e., Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Ce, Zn, Bi, Ag, Al, and Mg) to modify
nFe3O4 and explore the effect of different loading
metals on the CTC removal. As shown in Figure 7a, the removal effect of the commercial Fe3O4 on CTC was far less than that of the prepared
nFe3O4 and M-nFe3O4 after
a 90 min reaction. The removal rate with a difference of 50.4–70.4%
was observed. M-nFe3O4 prepared by the modification
of the transition metals (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ag) and the Mg element
can improve the CTC removal effect of nFe3O4. Cu-nFe3O4 was the most prominent, with a
removal rate reaching 82.72%. The M-nFe3O4 prepared
by the modification of Ce, Bi, and Al can inhibit the CTC removal
by nFe3O4. Compared with the commercial Fe3O4 (2.54 m2 g–1),
the BET surface area of the prepared nFe3O4 (73.84
m2 g–1) material significantly increased,
indicating that precipitation and metal modification can significantly
improve the pore structure and the specific surface area of nFe3O4. These structures fully exposed the active sites,
facilitated the adsorption and migration of the matrix, and improved
the material’s ability to remove contaminants.15

process of the double constant model fitting for the CTC removal with

(T = 298.15 K, m = 2.0 g L–1 ).

3.4 Effect of Copper Loadings
An investigation
on the effect of loading metals on the CTC removal showed that Cu-nFe3O4 prepared by the Cu element modification had
the most outstanding effect on the CTC removal by nFe3O4. Therefore, the Cu-nFe3O4 loading was
also investigated herein. Figure 7b shows that the removal efficiency of Cu-nFe3O4 to CTC also gradually increased with the load increase,
which was significantly improved when the load was 0.8 mM, indicating
that the load increase can improve the removal efficiency of Cu-nFe3O4 for CTC. The dynamic process was also studied,
and the data were fitted according to the double constant model26 (Figure 7c, Table S1). Comparing the correlation
coefficient (R2) of the CTC removal kinetics
model under different loadings, the removal kinetics was found to
be in accordance with the two-constant reaction kinetics model, indicating
that the reaction is mainly dominated by a chemical reaction with
physical adsorption. R2 exceeded 0.97,
indicating that ln(C/C0) had a good linear correlation with ln t. The reaction
rate constants (k) of the CTC removal were 0.3982,
0.4075, 0.4698, and 0.6161 ln–1 min at 0.1, 0.2,
0.4, and 0.8 mM loadings, respectively.

3.5 Effect of the Dosage
The active site
of the reaction was closely related to the dosage. This study investigated
the effect of the Cu-nFe3O4 dosage on the CTC
removal under the conditions of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g L–1. A better CTC removal effect was observed as the Cu-nFe3O4 dosage increased (Figure 7d). The CTC removal efficiency was only 47.18%
at 90 min when the dosage was 0.5 g L–1. Accordingly,
the removal efficiency of CTC can reach 98.04% at 90 min when the
dosage was 2.0 g L–1. The active site of the reaction
increased with the dosage increase; hence, the removal effect of Cu-nFe3O4 on the CTC treatment was improved. As shown
in Figure 7e and Table S1, a comparison of the correlation coefficients
(R2) of the CTC removal kinetics model
at different dosages showed that the removal kinetics was in accordance
with the double constant reaction kinetics model, and R2 exceeded 0.96, indicating that ln(C/C0) had a good linear correlation with
ln t. The reaction rate constants for the CTC removal
at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g L–1 were 0.1530, 0.5464,
0.6161, and 0.5399 ln–1 min, respectively.

3.6 Effect of the Initial CTC Concentrations
In the case of a certain amount of Cu-nFe3O4, the active site was limited; hence, the effect of the initial CTC
concentration on the Cu-nFe3O4 removal must
be investigated. At initial concentrations of 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg
L–1, the removal rates were 91.4, 97.7, 98.0, and
99.0% at 90 min, respectively. The results showed that the CTC removal
by CO-Cu-nMET was almost independent of the CTC concentration (Figure 7f). The main reasons
were as follows: the driving force provided by CTC was indispensable
for overcoming the resistance of the adsorbed material between the
water and solid phases. The total available active sites will not
limit the CTC removal under a certain Cu-nFe3O4 dosage.

3.7 Effect of Common Anions
The actual
wastewater contained not only the target pollutants, but also a variety
of anions and humic acids (HA), which may promote or inhibit the removal
effect. Nie et al.27 reported a chlorine
concentration of 2.0–3.7 mM in a wastewater treatment plant.
Lie et al.28 reported that HCO3– in the aquatic environment was usually present
at a 1–5 mM concentration. Ghaitidak and Yadav29 reported that the chlorine concentration in the gray waters
of Israel was 20 mM, while that in the gray waters of Yemen was 1.6
mM. The effects of 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 g L–1 HA and
1, 10, and 100 mM anions (Cl–, CO32–, NO3–, CO32–, and PO43–) on
the CTC removal in 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 were studied
herein.

As shown in Figure 8a, the effect of HA (inhibition
or promotion) on the CTC removal depended on the HA dosage. The presence
of HA within the HA concentration range of 0.1–1.0 g L–1 can promote the removal efficiency, but the promotion
efficiency decreased with the increase of the HA concentration. The
inhibitory effect was observed at a HA concentration of 2.0 g L–1 mainly because the HA can adsorb CTC (Figure S5) and react with the iron ions in the
aqueous solution.30 The active sites of
competitive reaction between HA and CTC will result in the decrease
of the CTC removal rate. The complexation was not obvious when the
HA concentration was in the range of 0.1–1.0 g L–1. The adsorption was also dominant, showing a promotive effect. The
complexation gradually became obvious, and the promotion efficiency
was lowered with the increase of the HA concentration. The complexation
effect was very significant when the HA concentration was 2.0 g L–1, which made the adsorption sites of CTC on HA and
the reaction sites on 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 decrease,
showing inhibition.

NaCl, (d) Na2CO3, and (e) Na3PO4 on the CTC removal by 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 (T = 298.15 K, C0 =
50 mg L–1) and (f) comparison of the SEM images
of (1) 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4, (2) post-reaction 0.8
Cu-nFe3O4, (3) post-reaction 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 (Na2CO3), and (4) post-reaction
0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 (Na3PO4).

Figure 8b,c depicts
the effects of NO3– and Cl– on the CTC removal from 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4. The
removal efficiency of CTC did not significantly change when the NO3– and Cl– concentrations
increased from 0 to 100 mM. The results showed that NO3– and Cl– in water did not inhibit
the CTC removal by 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4. However, NO3– and Cl– were the main
anions in the surface water, and NO3– and Cl– will not interfere with the CTC removal
by 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4, indicating that 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 was suitable for the removal of pollutants in
the surface water.

Figure 8d,e shows
that the removal rates of CTC by 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 was reduced by 57.5 and 83.3%, respectively, when CO32– and PO43– were
added at 10 mM. The removal rates of CTC decreased by 83.4 and 90.2%,
respectively, when adding them to 100 mM. The addition of CO32– and PO43– will
greatly inhibit the removal effect of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 on CTC. The SEM diagram in Figure 8f (see Figure S4 for an enlarged version) showed that the porous structure on the
surface of the post-reaction 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 decreased
with the addition of CO32– and PO43– but turned into dense layered structures,
which will reduce the active sites on the surface of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 and inhibit the CTC removal by 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4.

3.8 Cyclic Experiments
The preparation
of the magnetic nanomaterials aimed to achieve two main purposes:
(1) provide more reactive sites using their high specific surface
area and (2) make use of the magnetic properties of the materials
to facilitate recycling utilization. Therefore, the activity of material
reuse deserves attention. As shown in Figure 9a, four repeated experiments were performed
using 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 to remove CTC. The removal
rates of CTC were 93.4, 94.2, 94.8, and 93.1% after a 30 min reaction.
The prepared 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 had good reusability.
A comparison of the SEM images of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 before and after the reaction revealed that the number of spherical
0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 increased after the reaction (Figure 9b,c). This result
is attributed to the friction between the cup wall and 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 caused by the oscillating reaction. The core
structure of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 did not significantly
change before and after the reaction. The BET data also showed that
the specific surface area of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 after
the reaction was 14.3% larger than that of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 without the reaction, indicating that the spherical 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 after the reaction had a larger specific surface
area, which was also strong proof that the material’s multiple-reaction
efficiency did not decrease. As shown in Figure 8d, the solid–liquid separation performance
during the material recovery by the magnet was excellent before and
after multiple reactions, indicating that the reaction did not weaken
the magnetic characteristics of 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4, and it still had good recovery characteristics.

3.9 Mechanisms of the CTC Removal by Cu-nFe3O4
 2   3   4   5   6   7  

Fe(II)–Fe(III)
is an important redox couple in the natural environment. The transformation
between Fe(II) and Fe(III) can occur at various global aerobic–anoxic
boundaries. In natural waters, most of the dissolved Fe(II) and Fe(III)
exist in organic species through organic ligand complexation. Wang
et al. and Bolobajev et al.31,32 found that under a
homogeneous environment, neutral pH, and no light conditions, Fe(II)
was easily oxidized by oxygen to form a stable Fe(III). TCs could
interact with Fe(III) to further promote the TC oxidation and removal.
Fe(II) and Fe(III) exist in nano-Fe3O4 (Figure 10).

Figure 10 Removal mechanism of CTC by Cu-nFe3O4 in
a heterogeneous environment.

According to Figure S7, the main existing
forms of copper in the materials before the reaction are Cu (2p3), Cu2O, and CuO, and the main existing forms of
copper in the materials before the reaction are still Cu (2p3), Cu2O, and CuO, indicating that the basic copper in
the materials does not participate in the removal reaction with chlortetracycline,
but from the removal experiment, it can be seen that copper plays
a catalytic role in the reaction, accelerating the removal of chlortetracycline.
This study described the mechanism of the CTC removal by Cu-nFe3O4 in a heterogeneous environment. The porous structure
of Cu-nFe3O4 and the Fe(II) and Fe(III) redox
systems existing inside the porous structure provided the possibility
of CTC removal. First, CTC was rapidly adsorbed by the copper nanoporous
structure attached to the surface of Cu-nFe3O4 to form ∼CTC (reaction 2). Under a neutral or weak acid environment, the ∼CTC
reacted with Fe(III) to form CTC-Fe(III) and ∼ (reaction 3). ∼ continued the
adsorption process in reaction 2, and CTC-Fe(III) was decomposed into CTC· free radicals
and Fe(II) (reaction 4). Second, Cu∼CTC reacted with Fe(II) to form CTC-Fe(II) and
∼ (reaction 5).
Furthermore, CTC-Fe(II) reacted with dissolved oxygen (O2) in water to form CTC-Fe(III) and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(reaction 6). Finally,
CTC· and ROS reacted to degrade CTC (reaction 7). ROS is produced by the participation of
dissolved oxygen in the reaction process.

4 Conclusions
In this study, a copper-loaded nanomagnetic material (Cu-nFe3O4) was prepared by a one-step synthesis method,
which can effectively remove chlortetracycline. The XRD and BET data
showed that the Cu-nFe3O4 (73.28 m2 g–1) was 28 times larger than the commercial Fe3O4 (2.54 m2 g–1) and
had a certain Fe3O4 crystal structure. Meanwhile,
the SEM and HRTEM data depicted that the particle size of the 0.8
Cu-nFe3O4 nanoparticles ranges 15 to 20 nm,
and a loose structure with pores can be clearly observed in the HRTEM
image of a single particle. The batch study results indicated that
the maximum removal of chlortetracycline was 99.0% at dosage = 2.0
g L–1, copper loading = 0.8 mM, and C0 = 100 mg L–1 at the optimum conditions
within 90 min. At the same time, the effect of HA (inhibition or promotion)
on the CTC removal depended on the HA dosage; NO3– and Cl– would not interfere with the Cu-nFe3O4 removal of CTC; CO32– and PO43– would greatly inhibit the
removal of CTC by Cu-nFe3O4. This result was
attributed not only to the decrease in the porous structure of the
Cu-nFe3O4 surface after their addition but also
to the formation of a layered dense structure. The SVM characterization
showed that 0.8 Cu-nFe3O4 had good magnetic
properties. The solid–liquid separation performance before
and after the Cu-nFe3O4 multiple reactions during
the magnet recovery was good, indicating that the reaction did not
weaken the magnetic characteristics of the material, and the material
still had a good recovery characteristic. The mechanism of the chlortetracycline
removal by the Fe(II) and Fe(III) redox systems in the porous structure
of Cu-nFe3O4 and the porous structure in the
heterogeneous environment was elucidated.
