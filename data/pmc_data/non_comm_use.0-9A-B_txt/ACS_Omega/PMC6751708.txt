The
semi-transparent solar cells are promising to be applied in
building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and tandem solar cells. In
this study, we fabricate semi-transparent and stable solar cells for
BIPV by utilizing a poly (ethylene oxide) electrolyte and controlling
the size of TiO2 nanoparticles and the thickness of the
TiO2 film. The power conversion efficiency of the semi-transparent
(over 50% transmittance at 620–750 nm) and quasi-solid solar
cells is 5.78% under standard AM1.5G, 100 mW cm–2. The higher conductivity and smaller diffusion resistance of the
quasi-solid electrolyte inside the mesoporous TiO2 film
indicate the confinement effects of the polymer electrolyte inside
a mesoporous TiO2 film. The unsealed semi-transparent and
quasi-solid solar cell retains its initial efficiency during 1000
h irradiation in humid air.

1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) is a kind of photochemical cell,
which simulates plant photosynthesis. The outstanding advantages of
DSCs are green, abundant raw materials and color choice, as well as
low energy consumption in production and high power generation under
weak light. Currently, the world’s highest power conversion
efficiency (PCE) reaches approximately 15%1 under standard AM1.5G (100 mW cm–2) and about
28%2 under weak light (1000 Lux). Weak
light power generation of DSCs is promising to be applied at room
light conditions. Therefore, DSCs are more promising among the third-generation
thin-film solar cells and are still a hot topic in the research field.
As a third-generation thin-film solar cell, DSCs can be made into
a semi-transparent solar cell which greatly increases its application
field. The advantages of semi-transparent solar cells are mainly of
two aspects: on the one hand, the semi-transparent solar cell may
combine the glazing windows with a building to form household intelligent
windows, realizing the solar cell-building integration and saving
the space immensely. Meanwhile, it also has the function of shading,
which not only weakens the glare but also provides a broad view. Solar
cell-building integration is a distributed form, which largely saves
the area of cultivated land, unlike a large-area photovoltaic station.
On the other hand, we can combine the semi-transparent DSCs with other
solar cells to make a tandem solar cell.

The composition of
DSCs is as follows: photoanode, counter electrode,3−9 and electrolyte. However, the main problem of DSCs is that the liquid
electrolyte leaks easily and has poor stability. Therefore, the stability
problem must be solved to achieve industrialization. The development
of a solid or quasi-solid electrolyte is a very important direction
in the future.10 In our previous study,
polymer as a gelatin liquid electrolyte to fabricate a quasi-solid
DSC exhibited commendable performance. The electrically conductive
function of high-molecular-weight poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) was
investigated when it was used to gelate liquid electrolyte to fabricate
polymer gel electrolytes for DSCs.11 Our
previous study found that the diffusion coefficient of I3–/I– decreased constantly, while
the conductivity of the polymer gel electrolytes increased initially
and then decreased.11 So far, these two
inconsistent behaviors have not been solved and are understudied.
In addition, the properties and performance of PEO in semi-transparent
DSC devices have not been reported until now.

To overcome the
above problems, here, we designed and prepared
a green, semitransparent, and quasi-solid DSC (QS-DSC) by utilizing
the quasi-solid electrolyte and controlling the size of TiO2 nanoparticles and the thickness of the TiO2 film. We
find the confinement effects of the polymer electrolyte inside a mesoporous
TiO2 film. The PCE of the semi-transparent (over 50% transmittance
at 620–750 nm) and quasi-solid solar cell is 5.78% under standard
AM1.5G, 100 mW cm–2. In addition, QS-DSC exhibits
long-term stability.

2 Results and Discussion
Compared with the traditional liquid electrolyte, the fluidity
of the quasi-solid electrolyte is very poor, which is close to that
of the solid state as shown in Figure 1a. The quasi-solid electrolyte can decrease the leakage
of the electrolyte and increase the stability of the devices. We controlled
the size of TiO2 nanoparticles and the thickness of the
TiO2 film for preparing semi-transparent DSCs. A clear
outside view can be seen through the whole device of quasi-solid DSCs
as shown in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 Photographs: (a) liquid electrolyte (left) and quasi-solid electrolyte
(right) in inverted bottle. (b) Picture of QS-DSC.

The morphology of the mesoporous TiO2 film is
shown
in Figure 2a. The size
of the TiO2 nanoparticle selected is approximately 30 nm.
Larger TiO2 particles will lead to poor transparency of
the TiO2 film. TiO2 particles are stoutly connected
to each other by sintering ethyl cellulose as a binder at 500 °C,
which is favorable for electron transfer from the TiO2 film
to the electron collector (fluorine-doped tin oxide, FTO). The size
of mesopores in the TiO2 film is about 60–250 nm.
Many materials and reactions may exhibit peculiar properties in mesoporous
spaces (confined spaces).12 The cross section
is shown in Figure 2b. The thickness of the FTO layer is about 600 nm and that of the
mesoporous TiO2 film is 4.5 μm. In addition, the
thickness of the film is very uniform. The interior is full of mesopores.
The morphology of the quasi-solid electrolyte was analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 2c. A wrinkled film is observed on the surface
of the quasi-solid electrolyte. After magnification, the channels
exist on the surface of the PEO film, as shown in Figure 2d. These channels are beneficial
to the diffusion and transport of I–.

The absorptivity and transmittance of six devices
(FTO, FTO/3 μm
TiO2, FTO/7 μm TiO2, FTO/3 μm TiO2 + N719, FTO/7 μm TiO2 + N719, Pt counter
electrode, and QS-DSC) were compared, as shown in Figures 3a and S1. As shown in Figure 3a, the transmittance of FTO between 400 and 750 nm is all
above 80%. The transmittance of FTO/3 μm TiO2 and
FTO/7 μm TiO2 from 350 to 400 nm (ultraviolet range)
is below 40%, which is conducive to avoiding the harm caused by ultraviolet.
In addition, the transmittance at 500–750 nm (visible range)
exceeds 50%, which is conducive to meeting indoor light requirements.
The transmittance of the Pt counter electrode at 450–750 nm
is above 60%. The QS-DSC exhibits over 50% transmittance at 620–750
nm. In addition, the trend of absorption is consistent with that of
transmittance as shown in Figure S1. The
PCE of QS-DSCs was measured under 1 sun illumination. According to Figure 3b, with irradiation
from the front, QS-DSC based on the 3 μm TiO2 film
showed a PCE of 2.49%, with Voc = 0.677
V, Jsc = 6.25 mA/cm–2, and FF = 59.00%. QS-DSC based on the 7 μm TiO2 film showed a PCE of 5.78%, with Voc = 0.736 V, Jsc = 11.00 mA/cm–2, and FF = 71.60%. When irradiated from the rear, QS-DSCs based on
the 7 μm TiO2 film showed a PCE of 3.76%, with Voc = 0.710 V, Jsc = 7.77 mA/cm–2, and FF = 68.20%. Semi-transparent
DSCs can collect light from both sides, which will increase the PCE.
In addition, semi-transparent DSCs can also be used in tandem solar
cells.

illumination.

We tested the conductivity and
electrochemical impedance of the
polymer electrolyte. The schematic diagram of the test devices is
shown in Figure 4a.
The results of conductivity are shown in Figure 4b. We can see that the conductivities of
the quasi-solid electrolyte between the two electrodes without the
TiO2 mesoporous film and with the TiO2 mesoporous
film are 121.1 and 234 μs/cm, respectively. Compared to that
of the quasi-solid electrolyte without a TiO2 mesoporous
film, the conductivity of the quasi-solid electrolyte inside the TiO2 mesoporous film increases by 93.23%. The results indicate
that the TiO2 mesoporous film increases the conductivity
of the quasi-solid electrolyte because of the confinement effects.
In order to further confirm the confinement effect of the quasi-solid
electrolyte inside mesoporous films, we tested the electrochemical
impedance of two kinds of devices. According to the results of electrochemical
impedance spectra of these two device structures, their equivalent
circuits are drawn, as shown in the inset of Figure 4c. The series impedances of these two devices
are 9.5 and 10.3 Ω cm2, respectively. The first arc
corresponds to charge-transfer resistance in the interface between
the Pt counter electrode and quasi-solid electrolyte, while the second
arc corresponds to the diffusion resistance of the quasi-solid electrolyte.
It can be seen from Figure 4c that the diffusion resistance of the quasi-solid electrolyte
without a mesoporous TiO2 film is 635 Ω cm2. The diffusion resistance of the quasi-solid electrolyte inside
the TiO2 mesoporous film is 114 Ω cm2.
The results indicate that the diffusion resistance of the quasi-solid
electrolyte inside the TiO2 mesoporous film decreases obviously,
which further proves that the quasi-solid electrolyte exhibits the
confinement effect in the mesoporous film. The stability of unsealed
QS-DSCs during light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation in humid air
is shown in Figure 4d. We find that the PCE of unsealed QS-DSCs does not decrease after
1000 h, whereas the PCE of DSCs based on the liquid electrolyte decreases
from 4.0 to 0.07% after 36 h. Thus, QS-DSCs exhibit a very good stability
compared with DSCs based on the liquid electrolyte.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
The
chemicals used are
as follows: PEO (Mw = 2 × 106 g mol –1, Aldrich), iodine (I2, Guangdong Xilong Chemicals, China, analytically pure), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl
imidazolium iodide (DMPII, Shanghai Cheng Jie Chemicals, China, 99%),
lithium iodide (LiI, Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd 99%), 3-methoxypropionitrile
and N-methyl-benzimidazole (NMBI, Alfa Aesar, 99%),
3-methoxypropionitrile (MePN, Alfa Aesar, 99%), titanium dioxide (TiO2, OPV Tech Co., Ltd), FTO conductive glass (15 Ω, OPV
Tech Co., Ltd), platinum electrode (OPV Tech Co., Ltd), and N719 dye
(OPV-N719-Y, OPV Tech Co., Ltd). All materials were used without further
purification.

3.2 Preparation of the Quasi-Solid
Electrolyte
The preparation of the quasi-solid electrolytes
mainly involves
the following two steps. First, a liquid electrolyte was prepared,
which was composed of 0.1 mol L–1 LiI, 0.1 mol L–1 I2, 0.6 mol L–1 DMPII,
and 0.45 mol L–1 NMBI. MePN was used as a solvent.
Second, the PEO reagent was slowly added to the prepared liquid electrolyte.
The whole mixing system was heated under constant stirring. Thus,
a quasi-solid electrolyte was prepared, with a weight ratio of 7.5%
relative to the liquid electrolyte.

3.3 Preparation
of Quasi-Solid DSCs
Cleaning
of FTO conductive glass: the 15 Ω FTO conductive glass was successively
put into the detergent, deionized water, and anhydrous ethanol for
ultrasonic cleaning. The time of each ultrasonic cleaning was 5 min.

3.4 Preparation of Photoanodes
TiO2 was printed onto the cleaned FTO conductive glass by screen-printing.
One and three layers of titanium dioxide films were prepared. The
one-layer and three-layer titanium dioxide films are about 3 and 7
μm, respectively. The area of each photoanode film is 0.19 cm2. Then, the printed photoanode films were burned at 500 °C.
After cooling to 50°–60 °C, the photoanode films
were immersed in N719 dye solution (1.26 × 10–4 mol L–1, anhydrous ethanol as the solvent) for
20 h. After being immersed, the photoanode films were removed. The
N719 dye adsorbed on the surface of films was washed away with anhydrous
ethanol. Then, anhydrous ethanol was dried. Thus, photoanode films
were obtained.

3.5 Assembling of the Quasi-Solid
DSCs
First, two slender tapes were pasted on both sides of
the photoanode
films. Then, a small amount of quasi-solid electrolyte was added to
the photoanode film. The platinum electrode was placed on the quasi-solid
electrolyte. Thus, quasi-solid DSCs were assembled.

3.6 Characterizations
The EIS test of
quasi-solid DSCs was performed by an electrochemical workstation (CHI760
Chenhua, China), with an initial voltage of −0.7 V, a high
frequency of 106 Hz, and an amplitude of 0.005 V. A solar
simulator (IV5, PV Measurements, Inc., USA) was used to determinate
the dark current, stability, and PCE of the quasi-solid DSCs. The
thickness of the film was measured by a step tester (D-100, USA-KLA).
The conductivity of the quasi-solid electrolyte was measured by a
conductivity meter (DDSJ-308A, Shanghai Precision Scientific Instrument
Co., Ltd), with an electrode constant (K = L/S) of 0.017. Absorption and transmission
data of components were collected by a visible spectrophotometer (722E,
Shanghai Spectrum Instrument Co., Ltd).
