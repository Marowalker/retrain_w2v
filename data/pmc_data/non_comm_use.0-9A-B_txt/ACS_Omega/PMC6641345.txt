We investigate the arrangement of
donor molecules in vacuum-deposited
bulk heterojunction (BHJ) 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane
(TAPC):C70-based organic solar cells (OSCs). Even a low
dose of donors (∼10%) forms columnar structures that provide
pathways for efficient hole transport in the BHJ layer; however, these
structures disappear at donor concentrations below 10%, generating
disconnected and isolated hole pathways. The formation of columnar
donor structures is confirmed by the contrast of the contact potential
difference, measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy, and by the
trap-assisted charge injection at low donor concentrations. The mobility
of electrons and holes is well balanced in OSCs owing to the preservation
of the hole mobility at such low donor concentrations, consequently
maximizing the internal quantum efficiency of the OSCs. A high power
conversion efficiency of 6.24% was achieved in inverted TAPC:C70 (1:9) OSCs.

Introduction
In general, to achieve
efficient exciton dissociation in polymer
or small molecular bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs),
the donor to acceptor volume ratio should range from 4:1 to 1:4.1−5 For instance, for a low volume of donors, below the optimum donor
concentration, the hole transport is interrupted by the phase aggregation
of active materials and the imbalanced hole and electron mobility
increases bimolecular charge recombination.1,6,7

Recently, vacuum-deposited small molecular
OSCs (SMOSCs) with low
donor concentration (<20 vol %) were reported to exhibit considerably
high efficiency.8−11 The exciton dissociation efficiency in BHJ layers is enhanced when
ample donor/acceptor interfaces are generated through the random mixing
of donor and acceptor materials.12 Interestingly,
it has been demonstrated that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE)
is maximized at comparatively low donor concentrations, which creates
fewer donor/acceptor interfaces.8,9

Moreover, few
studies exist on the hole-transport pathways and
how these are actually formed despite the low dose of donor molecules.
Holes could be transported along the fullerene when fullerene acts
as a donor material.13 However, a very
low hole mobility in fullerene as an acceptor material in BHJ film
compared to that in 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane
(TAPC) would cause an electron and hole (e–h) imbalance and,
consequently, considerable charge recombination, which would result
in low power conversion efficiency (PCE).8,14−16 Therefore, further research is necessary on the correlation
between the balance of e–h mobility and the morphology variations
caused by donor concentration changes, which eventually affect charge
recombination and transport.7 Furthermore,
the morphological analysis in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film is necessary
to design the structure of small molecular organic electronics as
well as OSCs to achieve the desired electrical and morphological characteristics
of organic electronics.

As the thermally codeposited donor and
acceptor materials of SMOSCs
are stacked sequentially on substrates, they form horizontal and vertical
molecular arrangements in BHJ films without excessive phase aggregation,
as in polymer BHJ films.17,18 Moreover, many small
molecule materials for thermally evaporated OSCs showed that low donor
concentration is suitable for high PCE, which supports the similar
morphological tendency of various small molecule materials in BHJ
films as a function of donor concentration.8,9,19 Therefore, we can speculate that donors
with low concentration might be sufficient to form percolated pathways
for efficient hole transport.9,19 However, few confirmations
exist of the formation of such columnar-structured donors because
both donor and acceptor organic materials mainly consist of light
atoms, such as carbon and hydrogen; these do not exhibit sharp contrast
between donors and acceptors in high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) or two-dimensional-mapping energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy, hindering the analysis of columnar-structured donors.

In this study, we focus on the morphological variation of donors
in BHJ films as a function of donor concentration. For the first time,
we verify and visualize that hole-transporting pathways are formed
in a columnar structure across the BHJ layer when the donor concentration
is larger than 10%. Moreover, the columnar-structured donor can be
measured by ultrahigh resolution Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)
because donors and acceptors in BHJs have different energy levels.
Finally, we investigate the balance of e–h mobility with respect
to the donor concentration in BHJ OSCs for higher PCE.

Results and Discussion
Low-Concentration
Donor OSCs
In this work, TAPC (the
donor) and C70 fullerene (C70) (the acceptor)
were coevaporated to construct a BHJ layer in inverted BHJ SMOSCs. Figure S1 shows the extinction coefficients of
TAPC and C70, revealing that TAPC does not absorb visible
light; in contrast, C70 absorbs incident light in the overall
visible wavelength range below 800 nm. Hence, only the absorption
and exciton dissociation of C70 can be analyzed at all
visible wavelengths with respect to the TAPC concentration. Figure 1a presents the energy
level diagram and chemical structures of the TAPC donor in bulk C70 acceptor layers; the device structure is glass/indium tin
oxide (ITO)/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/C70 (10
nm)/TAPC:C70 (50 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (150 nm).

Figure 1b
illustrates
the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the inverted TAPC:C70 BHJ
SMOSCs with various concentrations of TAPC. When the TAPC concentration
begins to decrease from 50%, which is the commonly applied BHJ ratio,
the photovoltaic performance, such as the short-circuit current (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF), was enhanced.
The inverted OSC with 10% TAPC displayed an increase of Jsc calculated by external quantum efficiency (EQE) from
4.62 to 11.35 mA/cm2 with increased IQE and absorption,
and resultantly, EQE (Figure S2). The FF
of the inverted OSC gradually increased to 0.61 because the e–h
mobility was balanced with the decreased recombination of charges
due to the improved crystallinity of C70, as revealed in Figure S3 and Table S1.20,21 As a result, the inverted TAPC:C70 BHJ SMOSCs showed
a maximum PCE of 6.24% when the TAPC concentration was 10% (Table 1); the optimum donor
concentration is different from that in previous reports based on
a normal structure because different predeposited layers under BHJ
films (normal OSCs, MoO3, inverted OSCs, C70) and optical electric field distribution in OSCs can lead to the
morphological changes of BHJ and different exciton generation distributions
in BHJ films.8,22,23 For comparison, performance of normal TAPC:C70 OSCs as
a function of donor concentration is shown in Figure S4 and Table S2 (see the Supporting Information for more details). When the TAPC concentration
was lower than 10%, Jsc decreased despite
the increased absorption of the TAPC:C70 layer. Moreover,
the FF also started to decrease partly owing to the largely deteriorated
hole mobility, which can cause significant charge recombination.7,24

To check whether the other types of donors show a similar tendency
with TAPC donor material, chloroaluminium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc)
and tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) donor-based inverted OSCs
were fabricated. As shown in Figure S5 and Table S3, these OSCs showed the highest PCE at 10% donor concentration,
confirming that the low donor concentration in BHJ film is suitable
for high efficiency of OSCs.

Columnar-Structured Donor Molecules
In the fullerene-rich
BHJ layer, the dissociated free electrons are transported from the
C70 to the ITO. However, it is unclear whether holes are
transported along the TAPC or C70 to the Ag electrode because
a very small dose of donors was intermixed in the C70 layer.
To investigate where the holes are transported, a bulk C70 or TAPC layer (20 nm) was inserted between the BHJ and MoO3 layers, as shown in Figure S6a and the
inset of Figure 1c.
When a TAPC layer is added, the holes could be efficiently collected
at the Ag electrode regardless of whether they are transported along
(i) TAPC or (ii) C70. However, when a C70 layer
is added, the holes would be blocked by the C70 layer if
they are transported along (iii) TAPC, whereas they would be easily
collected at the electrode with transport along (iv) C70. Figure 1c demonstrates
the degraded photovoltaic characteristics observed when a bulk C70 layer was inserted. The IQE showed little change upon inserting
a 20 nm-thick TAPC layer compared with the reference device (Figure 1d). This result confirms
that the holes were transported mostly through the TAPC rather than
the C70. It should be noted that the absorption spectra
of the three types of devices were almost identical, as shown in Figure S6b. The hole mobility of the C70-added device decreased by up to 2 orders of magnitude, whereas the
hole mobility of the TAPC-added device was slightly decreased, indicating
that the holes were blocked by the added C70 layer (Figure S6c). The photovoltaic performance and
hole mobility of the reference and bulk C70- or TAPC-added
layer devices are summarized in Table S4.

Figure 2a
illustrates hypothetical cross-sectional morphologies of the TAPC:C70 BHJ layer as a function of donor concentration. At 50% TAPC
concentration, the TAPC would be well mixed with C70, forming
isotropic pathways because the volume of TAPC is sufficiently high.
However, when the concentration of TAPC decreases to 10%, the TAPC
is not sufficient to build both the vertical and the horizontal morphology.

and horizontal mobilities of low-TAPC-concentration SMOSCs.
(a) Schematic illustration of the cross-sectional morphology and (b)
vertical and horizontal hole mobilities of TAPC:C70 BHJ
layer with TAPC concentrations 10, 25, and 50%. (c) Illustration of
a hypothetical columnar-structured inverted TAPC:C70 BHJ
OSC, where C70 in the BHJ layer appears transparent.

Figure S7 and Table S5 show that the
surface energies (γtotal) of TAPC and C70 are 30.04 and 31.47 mN/m, respectively, inducing a high interfacial
tension of 7.63 mN/m that causes a repulsive force between TAPC and
C70.25 Consequently, the thermally
evaporated TAPC and C70 atoms are strongly attracted toward
the same types of predeposited atoms, eventually generating the surface-energy-driven
phase separation of TAPC and C70. Hence, the TAPC and C70 atoms are selectively self-assembled, showing the possibility
of the formation of vertically penetrating pathways from TAPC, similar
to that in columnar structures.18

We measured the vertical and horizontal hole mobilities using hole-only
devices and organic thin-film transistors, respectively. As shown
in Figure 2b and Table S6, when the concentration of TAPC varied
from 50 to 10%, the horizontal hole mobility of TAPC:C70 was further decreased compared with the vertical hole mobility (see
the Supporting Information for more experimental
details). The horizontal hole mobility measured by thin-film transistors
would be constrained to a few first monolayers. However, as illustrated
in Figure S8, the horizontal hole transport
in the first monolayers would be also affected by the columnar structure.
This confirms our assumption (Figure 2a) that vertical hole transport is not affected as
much as horizontal transport when the TAPC concentration decreases.
A hypothetical columnar-structured inverted BHJ SMOSC with low donor
concentration (∼10%) is illustrated in Figure 2c, where the C70 in the TAPC:C70 layer appears transparent.

To directly verify the
formation of TAPC columns at low concentrations,
the potential difference between donor and acceptor molecules was
visualized by KPFM analysis. Indeed, the potential contrast appears
because donor and acceptor molecules have different work functions.
Samples with the structure Si wafer/TAPC:C70 (340 nm)/Ag
(250 nm) were prepared and cleaved for a cross-sectional KPFM scan.

Figure 3a,b illustrates
the topographic images of 10 and 50% TAPC:C70 films, respectively,
with the corresponding contact potential difference (CPD) images in Figure 3c,d. Note that a
lower CPD indicates a higher work function of the sample and vice
versa. As shown in Figure S9, along the
vertical white lines, CPD was reduced by ∼300 mV with reference
to Si for the sample with 10% TAPC, in contrast to the 50% TAPC film,
where only a reduction of 100 mV was observed. This confirms that
the addition of p-type TAPC lowers the work function of the BHJ layer.

profiles for (e) 10 and (f) 50% TAPC. Insets of (e) and (f): angular
plot of the corrugation of the CPD profile. Scan size: 1 μm.

Figure 3e,f shows
the CPD along the horizontal white lines of the 10 and 50% TAPC:C70 films, respectively. In contrast to the unclear CPD contrast
in the 50% TAPC (Figure 3d), the CPD contrast by TAPC and C70 clearly appears horizontally
in the 10% TAPC (Figure 3c). It should be noted that the 10 and 50% TAPC films have similar
morphological variations (Figure 3a,b). The peak and valley of the CPD profile at 10%
concentration represent the TAPC-rich and C70-rich regions,
respectively. The insets of Figure 3e,f show the angular variations of the CPD profile
(in terms of corrugation). The CPD variation is the highest at 0°
angle because the TAPC forms the columnar structure. With increasing
scan angle, the CPD variation gradually decreased owing to the changed
distribution of TAPC and C70 along the scan lines. At 90°,
the CPD variation decreased sharply because only the TAPC-rich or
C70-rich phase was scanned. In contrast, the corrugation
of the CPD of the 50% TAPC film showed no angle dependency owing to
the randomly distributed TAPC and C70 in the BHJ film.
This confirms that columnar-shaped TAPC can be constructed in the
BHJ layer with merely 10% TAPC concentration for efficient hole transport.
Moreover, to verify that the CPD contrast in 10% TAPC is attributed
to columns of TAPC, not morphological variations of BHJ films, we
measured the CPD images at 5% donor and neat C70 (0% TAPC),
as shown in Figure S10. In contrast to
the clear CPD contrast in the 10% TAPC (Figure 3e), the CPD contrast in 0% TAPC was not shown
because only C70 was scanned. On increasing the donor concentration
from 0 to 5%, the peak of CPD profile that represents the TAPC-rich
region begins to appear. Moreover, the CPD contrast in 0 and 5% TAPC
did not follow the morphological variations, exhibiting that the CPD
contrast at 10% donor was not attributed to morphological variations.
Therefore, the potential profile using KPFM measurement as a function
of TAPC concentration showed direct evidences of columnar structure.

Meanwhile, we also measured the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray
scattering (GIWAXS) as a function of TAPC concentration for identifying
stacked TAPC in TAPC:C70 films. However, as shown in Figure S11, GIWAXS data did not show whether
the TAPC forms nanoscale columnar structures at low donor concentrations.
TAPC molecules might be randomly stacked at 100% TAPC layer (Figure S11e,f).

Next, we measured the external
quantum efficiency (EQE) of devices
with various donor concentrations under reverse bias,26−29 which can probe how many donor molecules are required to create
a columnar pathway in BHJ films. The examined structure was ITO/PEIE/TAPC:C70 (70 nm, 1–50% TAPC)/Ag (150 nm) with thick BHJ films
(70 nm) and without a MoO3 layer between BHJ and Ag electrode,
which is not the same as a general OSC structure. Figure 4a schematically illustrates
the hole charge injection from the anode and the disconnected TAPC
with donor concentration below 10%. Under illumination, the hole charges
are trapped on isolated TAPC molecules, which builds an electric field
from the BHJ toward the Ag electrode at the TAPC:C70/Ag
interfaces; this occurs because the optical electric field created
by the incident light in the BHJ layer is positioned near the Ag electrode
(Figure S12) and generates many trapped
holes at the organic/metal interfaces.26,29 Then, the
electron-injection barrier from Ag is narrowed because of the sharply
curved energy band at the TAPC:C70 interfaces. Under reverse
bias, electron tunneling from Ag to C70 occurs despite
the high electron-injection barrier from the anode to the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital of C70. Therefore, a higher EQE, above
100% (maximum 750%), was observed for TAPC concentrations 1, 3, and
5% under reverse bias (−0.5 V), as shown in Figure S13a. However, for more than 10% donor concentration,
TAPC columnar hole pathways are formed, removing the trapped hole
charges under illumination (Figure 4b). Hence, the electron tunneling disappears, reducing
the EQE value to below 100%. Indeed, the current density calculated
by EQE and photocurrent density from illuminated J–V under reverse bias (−0.5 V) sharply
increases for donor concentration below 10%, as shown in Figures 4c and S13b, which illustrates that the TAPC molecules
are disconnected and isolated at such low concentrations. The photovoltaic
performance of the OSCs below 10% TAPC concentration is summarized
in Figure S14 and Table S7, which demonstrate
that the columnar TAPC leads to higher PCE.

injection and correlation between e–h
mobility and IQE. Schematic illustration of the energy diagrams of
trap-assisted charge injection devices at zero and reverse bias (−0.5
V) for TAPC concentration (a) below 10% and (b) above 10%. (c) Current
density under reverse bias and (d) e–h mobility and IQE as
a function of TAPC concentration.

Balance of e–h Mobility
Figure 4d and Table S1 show the e–h mobility and IQE with respect to the TAPC concentration.
The hole mobility keeps decreasing with decreasing TAPC concentration
below 50% because of the restricted hole-transport pathways. However,
it should be noted that the film with 10% donor concentration still
maintains 62% of the hole mobility of the film with 50% donor concentration
owing to the preferentially columnar growth of TAPC, as revealed above.
Moreover, the electron mobility dramatically increases with lower
TAPC concentration, presumably because of the improved crystallinity
of C70, as shown in Figure S3.21 Consequently, an improved e–h
mobility balance for efficient charge collection was achieved at rather
low donor concentration and the well-balanced mobility facilitated
the reduction of charge recombination. Experimentally, the IQE of
the low-donor-concentration OSCs outperformed that of the high-donor-concentration
OSCs despite the reduction of exciton dissociation resulting from
the lower number of TAPC/C70 interfaces (Figure S15).30,31 However, for TAPC concentration
below 10%, the severely reduced hole mobility due to the isolated
TAPC islands deteriorated the IQE. Moreover, the decreased number
of TAPC/C70 interfaces at such low donor concentrations
can cause charge recombination and lower exciton dissociation.7,24

Conclusions
To summarize, we have proved that columnar
structures are formed
in low-donor-concentration BHJ layers. Experimentally, the preferentially
columnar structure for hole transport at low donor concentrations
was verified by the differences of the horizontal and vertical hole
mobilities and was visualized by the potential profiles of samples
with varying donor concentrations, obtained from KPFM analysis. The
driving force of the columnar structures is the high interfacial tension
between TAPC and C70, which results in self-assembled arrangements
of small molecules. However, below 10% donor concentration, the biased
EQE showed trap-assisted charge injection, suggesting a disconnected
arrangement of donor molecules. Finally, it was found that the OSCs
exhibit maximum IQE at 10% TAPC concentration primarily because of
the well-balanced e–h mobility.

Experimental Section
Inverted
OSC Fabrication
The OSCs were fabricated on
75 nm-thick ITO film-coated glass (JM International Co., Korea) substrates
(sheet resistance: 20 Ω/sq). Twice-sublimed 1,1-bis-(4-bis(4-methyl-phenyl)-amino-phenyl)-cyclohexane
(TAPC, EM index Co., Korea) and fullerene (C70, 99.9%,
EM index Co., Korea) were used as the active materials of the OSCs.
Prior to the evaporation of the materials, the precleaned substrates
were treated in air plasma for 5 min. A 0.4 wt % PEIE solution, prepared
by diluting polyethylenimine solution (Aldrich) with 2-methoxyethanol
(Aldrich), was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for
30 s and immediately annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. Next, the
PEIE-coated ITO glasses were placed into a vacuum chamber (pressure
< 3 × 10–7 Torr). The deposition of C70 (10 nm) at 0.5 Å/s was followed by that of TAPC:C70 (50 nm) onto the C70 layer. Subsequently, MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (150 nm) were deposited at 0.1 and 1.0 Å/s,
respectively. The device area of all fabricated solar cells was 15
mm2.

Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM)
An Agilent 5500
atomic force microscope with a conductive noncontact cantilever coated
with Pt/Ir was utilized for KPFM. The nominal resonance frequency, f0, used for mapping the topography was ∼75
kHz, and a 1 V to 10 kHz sinusoidal signal was additionally employed
to measure the CPD. The frequency, which was far from f0 and much faster than the topography feedback, prevented
the cross-talk of the CPD with the topography mapping. The work function
of the sample can be quantitatively evaluated by using the relation
φsample = φtip – e × CPD.

Contact Angle
The water and glycerol
contact angles
of TAPC and C70 were measured by a contact angle analyzer
(Pheonix 150, SEO Inc.).

Electrical Characterization
The
current density–voltage
(J–V) curves were measured
by a solar simulator under 100 mW/cm2 with an AM 1.5G filter
(PEC-L12, Peccell Technologies). To calibrate the 1 sun, a crystalline
silicon cell was used as the reference cell. The EQE was measured
by a spectral measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience Inc., Korea)
with a 300 W Xe lamp, an optical chopper (MC 2000 Thorlabs), and a
monochromator (Newport). The absorption of the OSCs was obtained from
the reflectance, which was measured with an integrating sphere. Next,
we calculated the total absorption of the device and the absorption
of the active layer only using a transfer-matrix formalism.32 Therefore, refractive indices of each layer
of OSCs including TAPC:C70 BHJ for 0, 5, 10, 25, and 50%
were obtained by ellipsometry. To obtain realistic IQE, we multiplied
the calibration factor (F_cal = measured total absorption/calculated
total absorption) by the calculated absorption of active layer only.
Using these, IQE was estimated by dividing the measured EQE by the
calculated absorption of active layer (e.g., TAPC and C70). For reproducibility of device performance, five devices of TAPC:C70 OSCs were measured.

Photoluminescence (PL)
Spectroscopy
Photoluminescence
(PL) of organic materials was measured by a PL spectroscopy system
(LabRAM HR UV/Vis/NIR PL, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France). A He–Ne
laser was used for excitation at a wavelength of 514 nm. Samples were
prepared on glass substrates.
