We present a numerical model to study the dynamic behaviors
and heat conduction of freezing liquid droplets based on the MDPDE
method (many-body dissipative particle dynamics with energy conservation
configurations). In this model, the freezing processes involved in
cooling, recalescence, and nucleation are considered. A new scaling
method was developed to connect the mesoscopic MDPDE coefficients
and macrothermal conductivity. The freezing of water droplets on cold
surfaces with different wettabilities was simulated. Both the evolution
of temperature and ice–liquid interface movement showed close
agreement with the experimental data.
We discuss the formation of a pointy tip on the top of an ice-drop
and nucleation and growth during the recalescence stage. The rapid
expansion of the recalescence region and the growth of the solid-phase
region were calculated numerically, and this showed that the nuclei
distribution of the two processes were completely different. The MDPDE
model can not only predict the freezing time and shape deformation
of ice-drops but also the nuclei formation and crystal growth during
solidification. This study provides a useful tool for deicing material
design.

Introduction
Ice formation
on material
surfaces plays an important role in refrigeration, air conditioning,
aerospace, agriculture, and applications in many other fields.1,2 In particular, in aircraft applications, mainly anti-icing and deicing
methods have been developed to prevent or weaken frosting.3,4

It is widely agreed that the freezing process of a droplet
can be described in four distinct stages.5−7 (1) Precooling stage: a droplet is cooled
by a cold source. During this stage, the temperature of the droplet
can be cooled below the equilibrium freezing temperature but crystal
nucleation does not occur. (2) Recalescence stage: supercooling-induced
kinetic crystal grows rapidly from crystal nuclei. In this stage,
supercooling is exhausted, and the droplet retains its equilibrium
temperature. (3) Solidification stage: the crystal grows until the
droplet is completely frozen. During this stage, the crystal growth
rate is governed by the heat transfer rate. (4) Cooling stage: the
temperature of a frozen droplet is cooled close to the temperature
of the cold source. In our previous droplet freezing studies,8−10 we found that the crystal growth
was delayed when the contact area between an ice-drop and a cold surface
was artificially reduced by roughness, wettability, and microstructures.
However, the design of deicing surfaces still requires an accurate
numerical method to predict both the temperature transition and dynamic
movement of freezing liquid.11,12

In 2003, Hindmarsh
et al.13 provided the first simple heat
balance numerical model to predict the temperature transition of a
suspended freezing droplet. In 2014, Chaudhary et al.14 further studied the freezing of a droplet on a cold surface,
with the solid/liquid interface position predicted by the temperature
method expressed on deforming grids. They developed a well-accepted
theory to simulate all four stages of freezing. In 2007, Zhang et
al.15 created a smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) model to study the spreading and solidification that occurs
during the impact of a droplet. In 2019, Gong et al.16 developed a lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) model to predict
crystal nucleus deformation. In both the SPH and LBM models, the stages
of freezing were ignored, and phase change was considered to occur
as soon as the droplet temperature reached the equilibrium temperature.
Therefore, the temperature evolution and freezing time did not match
previous experimental studies.5−8

The many-body dissipative
particle dynamics (MDPD) method has been widely utilized to study
the dynamic behaviors of liquid droplets.17−21 Based on our previous study,21 the MDPD method has advantages in simulating droplet with severe
deformation (like droplet impacting, spreading, and splashing). Due
to its high stability, the MDPD method can simulate splashed secondary
droplets, which are challenging to simulate by other mesoscopic methods
(including LBM, because of mesh deformation). Besides, the DPD method
has been famous for its calculation efficiency. In 2016, Yamada et
al.22 integrated an equation of the internal
energy state into the MDPD method to develop the MDPDE method (the
MDPD method with energy conservation configurations), which made the
simulation of temperature transition possible. As a result, except
for phase change, the temperature transition and dynamic behaviors
of liquid droplets can be predicted by the MDPDE method. Therefore,
it is meaningful to develop the MDPDE method to simulate the phase
change phenomenon. As a result, except for phase change, the temperature
transition and dynamic behaviors of liquid droplets can be predicted
by the MDPDE method.

Combining previous theoretical studies
of the liquid phase change13,14 and numerical studies
of the dynamical method,15,16,21,22 a simple heat balance model can
only predict the temperature fluctuation. Dynamical methods (like
LBM and SPH) were good at simulating the deformation of the droplet,
but solidification progress was thought to begin as soon as the droplet
temperature reached the equilibrium value.
However, the real physical progress of freezing was far more complex
than this, which led to a much shorter freezing time in previous dynamical
methods than the experiment results. The ice nucleation model in this
study considered the whole four stages (precooling, recalescence,
solidification, and cooling) during droplet freezing, which made the
simulation of all physical progress (the formation of a recalescence
region, the evolvement of a solidification structure, etc.) possible.
Therefore, the simulation results using this model will be more precise
than previous dynamic methods. In this study, the temperature transition,
ice crystal nucleation, and dynamic behaviors of droplets that occur
during the liquid phase change were investigated. First, we develop
a simple equation to connect mesoscopic MDPDE parameters to macrothermal
conductivity, which is then verified by the classical one-dimensional
heat conduction. Next, the freezing process of a liquid on cold surfaces
with different wettabilities is simulated. The temperature evolution
during the four stages of freezing and interphase movement are in
good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, we discuss ice
shape deformation and crystal nucleus growth during droplet freezing.

Method
MDPDE
Governing Equations
Interactions between
Liquid Particles
In the MDPD method, each particle represents
a cluster of real molecules moving in a Lagrangian fashion.23,24 Both fluids and solids were modeled by a group of DPD particles.
In each time step Δt, all particles were defined
by mass mi, temperature Ti, position xi, velocity vi, and interaction force Fij. The interaction force usually consisted of conservative
force FijC, dissipative force FijD, and random force FijR 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  where rij is the relative position of particles i and j; rc is the cut-off
range for the interaction of two particles and was usually chosen
to be 1lDPD; Aij and Bij are the amplitudes of attractive and repulsive forces, respectively;
γ and ξ are the amplitude of the dissipation and random
force, respectively;  is the number density of particle i; ωc and ωd are weight functions; kB is the Boltzmann constant; φij is a random distribution function with zero mean unit variance;
and the cut-off for attractive force rd = 0.75rc.

Internal Energy Equation
The total internal energy,
expressed as heat capacity Cv and temperature T, is composed of mechanical energy-caused viscous heating qijV, temperature difference-caused heat transport qijC, and thermal fluctuation-caused random heat
flux qijR. The governing equations can be expressed
as follows25−27 9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17  where κij and αij are the strengths
of the conductive and random heat fluxes, respectively; k0 is described as the mesoscopic thermal conductivity; sv is a correlation of the Schmidt number; and
ωD and ωR are weight functions.
It is worth mentioning that, in many articles on the energy conservation
DPD method,25−31 the relationship between k0 and macrothermal conductivity is controversial.
In earlier articles,26−29k0 was considered
to be thermal conductivity, and the relationship between k0 and κij was different.
In 2010, Abu-Nada30 developed an equation
defining the relationship between k0 and
κij (eq 13). In 2014, Li et al.31 published a method to calculate k0 using the Prandtl number and viscosity. However, the viscosity
is not stable in most MDPD simulations, which constitutes a common
weakness of the MDPD method.18 Furthermore,
in industrial applications, thermal conductivity is more available
than the Prandtl number. Therefore, defining the relationship between k0 and macrothermal conductivity for the MDPDE
method was required and will be discussed later.

Ice Nucleation Model
During the four stages
of liquid droplet freezing, the precooling and cooling stages can
be estimated by solving the internal heat equation. The physical properties
of water and ice were considered: density, ρ*l = 1000 kg m–3, ρ*s = 917 kg m–3; capacity, Cv*l = 4.2e6 J K–1 m–3, Cv*s = 1.9e6 J K–1 m–3; and thermal conductivity,
λ*l =
0.55 J m–1 K–1 s–1, λ*s = 2.26 J m–1 K–1 s–1 (l for liquid, s for solid, * for reality coefficient; parameters
without * are in DPD units).32 The changes
in these properties with changing temperatures were simplified and
held constant. Heat transfer between air and liquid was much smaller
than that between a cold surface and liquid, so the heat transfer
of ambient air was ignored.

Based on Hindmarsh et al.’s13 and Chaudhary et al.’s14 theories, prior to nucleation, the temperature inside a
supercooling droplet is not equally distributed. Some part of the
droplet has a temperature below the equilibrium temperature Te—the interface, for example—but
freezing did not begin. Experimentally, the nucleation temperature Tn was used to determine whether the supercooling
was enough for recalescence. The nucleation temperature could be any
arbitrary value below the equilibrium temperature and is thought to
be related to the diameter of a droplet.33 For a droplet with a volume of 7.2 μL, Tn* was set to −14 °C.14 On reaching Tn*, the droplet is assumed
to have a high probability of forming ice nuclei of a critical size,
which are able to grow spontaneously and then form into ice crystals
in the new phase.34,35 Mesoscopically, the freezing
probability R equals the probability of the formation
of one ice nucleus of critical size. Since ice nuclei below critical
size are unstable, when the temperature of a cold source is approximately Tn, the freezing probability is very high, and
determining R is not necessary for recalescence,
as Tn sufficed as the initial conditions
of recalescence. As a simplification, in the previous research,13,14,33 once the average temperature
of a droplet was lower than Tn, all particles
of the droplet were immediately set to the recalescence stage with
a temperature of Te.

When the freezing
probability is relatively low, recalescence might occur in a period
of time after a droplet reaches Tn; hence,
both Tn and R are necessary
for the initial conditions of recalescence in this case. We assume
that, in every interaction of two liquid particles inside a supercooling
droplet, nucleation occurred with a probability of Q. The relationship between the probability of freezing and nucleation
is as follows 18  where ρ is the number density and n is the
number of liquid particles inside a droplet. Once nucleation began,
the particle would be initialized to the recalescence stage with a
temperature of Te. When the liquid particles
interacted with nucleated particles, they would also be initialized
to the recalescence stage with Te.

During recalescence, the temperature did not change until the latent
heat L (333 kJ kg–1) was exhausted.13 In other words, for frozen and recalescence
liquid particles, 19  The recalescence particle will not be completely nucleated until
the latent heat has been exhausted, and the temperature is below Te (at which point it is called a nucleated particle).
When two nucleated particles have temperatures below Te, their dynamic interaction and heat transfer are controlled
by the physical properties of their solid phase (ice). In this study,
the interaction of ice particles was simulated by a spring damping
model. Compared to the interaction of liquids (eqs 1–6), the random
parameter for the solid phase was set to zero (ξs = 0), and the dissipation parameter, which represents viscosity,
was set extremely high at γs = 5γl. The Young’s modulus of ice particles did not match reality.
Besides, the strong influence of the environment and re-icing process
have not been considered in this study. For example, during the re-icing
process, there might be no recalescence stage. Related influences
were summarized in Jung et al.’s36 and Chu et al.’s study37 in detail.
These issues will be further discussed in subsequent research.

Scaling Methodology
The scaling of
length and temperature depends on the practical application. To simulate
a droplet of 7.2 μL, the length unit was characterized as lR = 1e–4 m and the temperature unit as TR = 300 K. The Boltzmann constant (kB* = 1.38e–23
J K–1) was usually set to kB = 1, and 3.9e15 H2O molecules were considered
as a single DPD bead. Based on our previous work,21 the mass, time, and energy units were characterized as
follows 20   21   22  where R represents the scaling unit;
* represents the real value; the surface tension coefficient σ* is 0.072 N m–1; and σfit can be calculated from the following equation20 23  For a good view of ice shape
deformation, the number density of droplets in this study was set
to ρ = 8.6. Correspondingly, we set Al = −200, Bl = 25, and γl = 2. Considering the density of ice, we set As = −181.8 and Bs =
27.5. In this way, ρs = 0.917ρl and
matches the experimental data.13 From eqs 20–23, tR is equal to 3.28e–4s.
The total computational time steps can be calculated by the target
simulation time divided by the time step Δt and DPD time unit tR. Considering the
fact that the entire cooling and freezing process usually lasted hundreds
of seconds,13,14tR = 3.28e–4s was too small for the droplet freezing simulation.
To prevent massive computational cost, tR was set to 0.1 s, which resulted in an unreal surface tension coefficient
(from eq 21, the surface
tension coefficient fitted by tR differs
from the real value). Gravity and surface tension contribute to the
shape of a droplet on a solid surface. Therefore, the Bond number
was maintained to correct for the effect of the unreal time unit 24  Based on eq 24, gravity was set to g = 0.01. Through dimensional analysis, heat capacity can be characterized
as 25  Ignoring viscous heat and
random heat, from eqs 11 and 13, we can roughly estimate this with
a hypothetical unit volume and unit temperature difference as follows38 26  Through
dimensional analysis of macrothermal conductivity λ, we know
that with a unit length and unit temperature difference 27  From eqs 25–27, we found that 28  Considering
the influence of weight functions,38 there
should be a coefficient x to correct k0. From the following validation by a classic thermal
conduction problem, the coefficient x is approximately
34.4. The physical properties used for model predictions are summarized
in Table 1.

Results
Validation
of Thermal Conductivity
To validate our approach, a classic
thermal conduction problem was simulated. As shown in Figure 1, in a two-dimensional (2-D)
square computational region (45 × 20), 7800 liquid particles
were uniformly distributed with a density of ρl and
a temperature of 1.2 (DPD units). The simulation system is a bulk
system with reflection boundaries.17 The
dynamic parameters we used are listed in Table 2. This system was designed for the thermo-function
test, and the dynamic parameters could be flexible. In the first step
of the simulation, the temperature of the particles in the lowest
two layers (particles with coordinate between y =
0 and ) was maintained at 0.8
to act as a cold source. Afterward, the whole region would begin to
cool. To focus on the heat transfer, the solidification process was
ignored. Theoretically, this problem can be solved analytically by
the heat conduction equation39 29  where the thermal conductivity λ and heat capacity Cv were 0.55 J m–1 K–1 s–1 and 4.2e6 J K–1 m–3, respectively, in the real unit.

Thermal
conduction of liquid was simulated with different number densities
(ρ = 4.0, 8.6, 10.0), different scaling units (mesoscopic, lR = 0.1 mm; microscopic, lR = 10 nm), and different dimensions (three-dimensional, 3-D).
For liquid models with different number densities, the Cv and k0 were different in
the DPD unit based on eqs 25 and 28. The simulation on the microscopic
scale was produced with lR = 10 nm, tR = 1e–4s, simulation box: 450 nm ×
200 nm. The average temperature was compared with the analytical solution.
In 3D simulation, the simulation box was set as the 10 × 10 ×
10 DPD unit. The temperature evolution was also compared with the
analytical solution. As presented in Figure 4, all simulation results showed close agreement
with the analytical results. Therefore, we assume that the scaling
methodology proposed in this study is valid.

Droplet Freezing on a Cold Surface
The freezing of
a 7.2 μL droplet on a hydrophobic surface (contact angle θc = 110°) was simulated. The initial temperature of the
droplet was 0.91 (0 °C), and the cold surface was maintained
at 0.857 (−16 °C). The wettability of the cold surface
was controlled by adjusting the attractive and repulsive coefficients
for surface–liquid interaction (for θc = 70,
90, 110, 130, and 150°, Asl = −60,
−48, −36, −22, −10, respectively; Bsl = 25).

Figure 5 shows the temperature evolution and liquid–ice
interface movement of a droplet freezing on a cold surface of −16
°C, 110°, during the recalescence, solidification, and cooling
stages. The MDPDE result exhibits good agreement with Chaudhary’s
research.14 The difference between the
experimental data and numerical results could be caused by the insert
temperature sensor. As the extension of the ice phase, the difference
in temperature inside the droplet reduced, which induced the increase
of equipment error. The experimental data for “center freezing
height” are not available in Chaudhary’s research14 but it can be measured using a high-speed camera.
The topmost temperature distribution and shape deformation of the
ice-drop are shown in Figure 6. In frame (A), a droplet before recalescence usually had
a nearly uniform internal temperature. In frame (B), the droplet reaches Te very quickly at the beginning of the recalescence
stage. In frames (C) and (D), as the droplet cooled, the ice–liquid
interfaces moved upward. The temperature of the liquid region remained
at Te, while a variable temperature distribution
is shown in the solid region. In frames (E) and (F), because the solid
phase of a droplet had larger thermal conductivity and smaller heat
capacity than in the liquid phase, the droplet cooled rapidly. This
series of observed changes is identical to our previous experimental
study.8

evolution (A) and interface movement (B) inside a droplet freezing
on a cold surface (the center freezing height has been normalized
by a diameter).

Figure 6 Temperature
distribution inside a droplet at different time steps (θ = 110°).

Next, the freezing of a droplet
on surfaces with various wettabilities was simulated. The topmost
temperature evolution of the entire solidification stage is shown
in Figure 7. In the
beginning, the droplet was set to have a temperature of 0 °C.
The initiation time of recalescence was determined to be 0 s. After
0 s, the time for a droplet to complete solidification was called
the freezing time. The temperature did not fall until the latent heat
was exhausted. Once the latent heat was exhausted by the surroundings,
the recalescence particle was nucleated. Therefore, the length of
time that the topmost temperature maintained Te can be assumed to be the freezing time. On hydrophilic surfaces,
the interface between a droplet and a cold surface was large, and
the droplet height (thermal conduction length) was small. In Gong
et al.’s study,16 the reason why
the hydrophobic material could delay droplet freezing was described
as the fact that the decrease of the contact area (induced by wettability)
delayed the solidification rate. Using our model, this phenomenon
shall be analyzed differently. First, with the decrease of the contact
area, the cooling rate during the precooling stage was delayed, and
this can also be seen in Gong et al.’s study.16 Second, the decrease of thermoconduction (induced by the
contact area) affected the release of latent heat, which extended
the time of the solidification stage. In other words, hydrophobic
surfaces can both delay the droplet’s freezing and slow down
its nucleation rate.

Discussion
Ice Deformation After Freezing
When
a droplet froze on a hydrophilic (θc = 70°)
and a hydrophobic (θc = 110°) surface, ice deformation
was recorded. The attractive coefficient and repulsive coefficient
of the droplet model was 200.0 and 25.0, respectively, which matched
the number density of 8.6. For pure water, under normal atmospheric
pressure, the density of ice was 917 kg m–3. However,
when the droplet was mixed with other chemical components, the density
could be variable. A large range of density change can be numerically
computed by changing the attractive and repulsive parameters in our
model. The freezing process of droplets with different solid-phase
densities (from 1000 to 593 kg m–3) was simulated
(with the droplets’ initial temperature being 0.91 (0 °C)
and surface temperature being 0.857 (−16 °C)). Related
coefficients and ice densities are shown in Table 3.

Figure 8 shows ice shapes with different ice densities.
Along the direction of droplet height, the droplet can be considered
to be composed of cylinders with different perimeters. During the
solidification process, the cylinders freeze from the bottom to the
top. With the same surface tension coefficient, cylinders with larger
perimeters have higher surface tensions. Therefore, the top of the
droplet usually has a large deformation. As long as the ice density
was larger than the droplet density, we observe an obvious pointy
tip on the top of the ice-drop. The MDPDE droplet freezing model can
predict the phase change-induced deformation at any density ratio
(ρ* = ρMR/lR3). The
more serious the density changes, correspondingly more obvious conical
ice was seen. The interaction between a cold surface and ice was identical
to that between ice (nucleated) particles. Therefore, as the droplet
solidified, the droplet-surface interface line extended, as well.
In previous theoretical studies,40,41 the ice tip
formation can be deduced analytically when the density change was
between 1000 and 917 kg m–3. To simplify the derivation
process, the liquid–surface interface line (which was not fixed
intentionally in this model) was simplified as unmovable in theoretical
studies. Numerically, we can also set the liquid–surface interface
line to be unmovable and this will not change the regular ice deformation.

(θ = 110°), right: on a hydrophilic surface (θ =
90°)).

It is worth mentioning that the force law of eq 2 is not conservative unless the repulsive
coefficient B is a constant (based on Warren’s
no-go theorem42). Therefore, although both
the coefficients A and B can be
used to tune the droplet density, it is better to keep the B value equal.

Crystal Nucleation
Process
In previous studies13,14 about the solidification
stage of a droplet, a nucleation temperature Tn was applied to determine the initiation of the recalescence
stage, and the temperature of all liquid particles reached equilibrium
temperature Te at the beginning of recalescence.
Based on Bigg’s33 research, a droplet
at nucleation temperature is at its maximum freezing probability.
When the environmental conditions were conducive to a droplet freezing,
the freezing probability (in other words, the nucleation probability Q) could be very high, and the droplet particles were nucleated
almost simultaneously, which agreed with the previous theory. However,
when the temperature of a cold source was not near Tn, or when the ambient temperature was much higher than Tn, the nucleation probability could be very
low, which means that the previous theory would no longer be suitable.
In this article, we provide a new model to study droplet freezing
when the freezing probability is low (due to environmental conditions)
and when nucleation probability is not uniformly distributed. In most
experiments, before recalescence, the temperature inside the droplet
was almost uniform.13,14,33 In
this model, Tn was also applied as a condition
of supercooling. Every time a liquid droplet interacted with another,
there was a probability Q that it would be initiated
into the recalescence stage with a temperature of Te and have latent heat added to its enthalpy. Q is related to the cooling environment of the droplet,
and the value of Q influenced the time of precooling
stage. Mainly, the deicing method was by reducing the contact time
of liquid and cold substrate. Therefore, the time of precooling determines
whether a droplet can freeze on the deicing material. However, if
the precooling time is negligible, Zhang et al.’s VOF model43 and Tembely et al.’s model44 are recommended. By setting the probability Q to be 1, the simulation result in our model will be similar
to that in their models. During the recalescence stage, particle temperature
does not decrease until the latent heat is exhausted. Once the temperature
of the recalescence particle was below Te, a nucleus formed. The nucleated particle can also continue to activate
the recalescence of other particles.

Figure 9 shows a droplet composed of liquid particles,
all having a temperature of 0.857(−16 °C), while the temperature
of the cold surface was also set to 0.857(−16 °C). Because
of the low Q (which was set to 1e–4%),
nucleation did not begin. In this study, the model we proposed was
a local-parameter-based
method.44,45 The droplet was simplified to be isotropy,
and every liquid particle was initialized to the recalescence stage
with a probability of Q (see eq 18). Recalescence particles were not nucleated
until the latent heat L of it was exhausted by the
low-temperature liquid around it. When the particle was nucleated,
the physical parameters of the DPD particle was changed from liquid
parameters to solid parameters. Then, the nuclei began initializing
the recalescence of particles around it (in Figure 9, when t = 0.49 s, a recalescence
region is observed). At the same time, the temperature inside the
droplet was no longer uniform. As the recalescence particles were
cooled by surrounding liquid particles, more particles were nucleated,
leading to the expansion of the recalescence region. Most of the particles
then began recalescence (Figure 9, 0.91 s), and almost all regions of the droplet showed
a temperature of Te. A nucleated particle
initialized the recalescence of the surrounding particles, so there
was always a nucleus at the center of a recalescence region. Particles
at the edge of the recalescence region were cooled first and were
more easily nucleated. Therefore, in recalescence regions, nucleated
particles were loosely distributed. This can be thought to be the
initial state of the ice structure. The interactions between recalescence
particles and nucleated particles were based on the interactions of
liquid. Therefore, the ice structure in the initial state was similar
to a liquid. Afterward, once the recalescence region reached the cold
surface (Figure 9,
1.87 s), the latent heat was consumed quickly (the cold surface was
set to have a constant temperature), and thus the particles were nucleated
quickly, and the nucleated particles were tightly distributed (Figure 9, 1.87 s). Regions
with tightly distributed nuclei were defined as solid-phase regions.
This was the final state of the ice structure, which can be thought
as a rigid structure. When the solid phase first appeared, the interface
of liquid–solid might be oblique (1.87 s, 2.8 s), due to the
randomness of nucleation. Particles closer to the surface had a quicker
heat transfer rate, which resulted in a quicker nucleation rate. Therefore,
after many time steps, the liquid–solid interphase tended to
be a circular arc perpendicular to the liquid–surface interface
(6.64 s). As long as the surface had the minimum temperature, the
droplet froze from bottom to top (14.63 s). Due to the density difference
between liquid and solid states, the last region to freeze froze into
a sharp tip at the top of the droplet (18.67 s). The flow chart of
the nucleation model is presented below. Our simulation showed an
example of a nonequilibrium solidification, in which the large temperature
perturbation enforces the system to crystallize. The simulation of
equilibrium solid–liquid transitions requires sampling schemes
to surmount the liquid–solid free energy barrier,46,47 which will be investigated in our future study.

The nucleation
model proposed in this study requires a nucleation probability, which
can only be determined by a molecular-level simulation. However, it
can be predicted statistically by foreign matter content, droplet
size, etc. As mentioned in our previous study,8 although the solidification occurred in tens of seconds, when the
nucleation was low, the time of the precooling stage could be hundreds
of seconds. Therefore, when the nucleation probability is low (for
example, as with supercooled droplets undergoing deformation), the
time of the precooling stage was greatly increased. It is worth mentioning
that although the first nuclei appeared at a random part of the droplet,
the obvious solid phase usually appeared from the solid substrate.
Inside the recalescence region, particles at the edge of the region
always cooled first, which lead to the loosely distributed nucleus
in this region. Therefore, the solid phase during the recalescence
stage was invisible. But once the recalescence region extended to
the solid substrate with a permanent temperature, the whole region
was cooled quickly, and a visible solid phase with a closely distributed
nucleus appeared. Recalescence did not begin as soon as the droplet
temperature reached its critical value, which might induce the freezing
time in numerical simulations that do not match the experimental data.
Moreover, when the nucleation probability inside a droplet is not
uniform (for example, as with heterogeneous liquid droplets), ice
formation could be quite atypical. These situations can be easily
simulated by the nucleation model proposed above.

In our simulations,
the heat transfer of ambient air was ignored. There are two ways to
simulate thermal conduction between liquid and ambient air. (1) Heat
is conducted directly to the droplet particles near the liquid–gas
interface. This method requires the deformation of a droplet to be
small for the interface of liquid–gas to be easily determined,
and the temperature of ambient air can be considered to be a stable
value. (2) Gas particles are applied to simulate the liquid–gas
heat transfer. With gas particles, the interface can be predicted
precisely, especially when a droplet is greatly deformed by inertia
and surface tension, and this method can also simulate the temperature
distribution of ambient air. However, it is unnecessary to expend
effort simulating the movement of air particles that have little contribution
to the dynamic behaviors of a droplet (considering that the simulation
of surface tension does not need gas particles in the MDPD method).
The appropriate ambient thermal conduction method can be chosen for
each specific situation.

Conclusions
This study presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration
of the capability of the MDPDE method to simulate the heat transfer
and ice crystal nucleus deformation of the entire droplet freezing
process. This model can accurately predict the freezing time and ice
deformation of liquid droplets, which provides a powerful tool to
study the liquid–solid phase change. In the simulation of droplet
freezing on the cold substrate, substrate wettability has two effects
on droplet freezing: the cooling rate during the precooling stage
and the length of solidification time. Furthermore, the evolvement
of the ice structure can be summarized as follows. Prior to the recalescence
stage, a random area of the droplet was initialized (induced by nucleation
probability). With the release of latent heat, a recalescence region
with a high temperature could be observed. Once the latent heat was
exhausted, more nucleation was initialized, which led to the rapid
expansion of the recalescence region. Soon afterward, the whole droplet
reached the equilibrium temperature. The edges of the recalescence
region cooled first, so new nuclei appeared mostly at these edges,
which led to loosely distributed nuclei inside the region. Once the
recalescence expanded to the interface of the cold source, the whole
recalescence region around the cold source was cooled. At this point,
tightly distributed nuclei could be seen, which signifies the beginning
of the solidification stage. This explains why solidification usually
appears at the interface of a cold source. Depending on the distance
from the cold source, a solid phase with tightly distributed nuclei
expanded from proximal to distal.
