We
report a simple device that generates synchronized mechanical
and electrical pressure waves for carrying out bacterial transformation.
The mechanical pressure waves are produced by igniting a confined
nanoenergetic composite material that provides ultrahigh pressure.
Further, this device has an arrangement through which a synchronized
electric field (of a time-varying nature) is initiated at a delay
of ≈85 μs at the full width half-maxima point of the
pressure pulse. The pressure waves so generated are incident to a
thin aluminum–polydimethylsiloxane membrane that partitions
the ignition chamber from the column of the mixture containing bacterial
cells (Escherichia coli BL21) and 4
kb transforming DNA. A combination of mechanical and electrical pressure
pulse created through the above arrangement ensures that the transforming
DNA transports across the cell membrane into the cell, leading to
a transformation event. This unique device has been successfully operated
for efficient gene (∼4 kb) transfer into cells. The transformation
efficacy of this device is found comparable to the other standard
methods and protocols for carrying out the transformation.

Introduction
Bacterial transformation
is a powerful tool in genetic engineering
and is of great importance in molecular cloning and environmental
microbiology.1 It is widely used in high-throughput
studies, such as developing random gene libraries.2 Transfer of DNA into bacterial cells takes place through
some natural methods like transformation, transduction, and conjugation.3 All of these methods are not promising due to
restrictions like a limited host range of bacteriophage and the requirement
of physical contact between the recipient and the donor with the involvement
of a third bacteria containing the helper plasmid.4,5 The
increased search for improved methods to efficiently deliver molecular
and genetic materials into cells has been a core interest area for
the engineering community pursuing the advancement of gene therapy
techniques.6 The current procedures for
molecular transport into cells are broadly classified into two basic
categories: viral and nonviral.7,8 The viral carriers such
as adenoviruses and retroviruses show high delivery efficiency but
lack in target specificity and maximum allowable therapeutic gene
size.7,8 The nonviral carriers, such as electroporation,9 sonoporation,10 gene-gun,11 chemical carrier delivery,12 microinjection,13 ultrasound,14 laser irradiation,15 and mineral nanofibres,16 although less
toxic than their viral counterparts, are limited in their efficiency,
lack target specificity, and possess high cell mortality.

With
the rapid emergence of the DNA recombinant technology and
the fast evolution of bacterial genome sequencing, there is an increased
demand for developing an easier, quicker, and effective transformation
technique. Among nonviral transformation methods, the use of pressure
waves for inducing temporary cell permeabilization for facilitating
foreign molecule transport has been identified as a promising technique.17 The nonviral vector transformation methods,
such as electrotransfer or pressure wave transportation, create nonspecific
and transient membrane permeability, and the molecular transport finally
occurs through these artificially created pores on the membrane surface.
Pressure waves with wave speeds traveling at 1.5 Mach for gene delivery
applications can be generated by methods like shock wave lithotripsy,18 shock tube,19 and
laser ablation20 and by the burning of
nanoenergetic composites that are capable of quick energy release.21 Gangopadhyay et al.21 reported delivery of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran in chicken
heart cells using pressure waves generated from the combustion of
nanothermite materials. Prakash et al.22 reported the transformation of Escherichia coli DH5α cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmids (size
∼5.37 kb) through shockwaves using explosive-coated polymer
tubes to achieve higher transformation efficiency.

The other
primary nonviral vector transformation methods like electrotransformation
method was developed long back in 1980 where ultrahigh external electric
field pulses (of the order of ∼6.25 kV/cm) were deployed to
cause cell membrane permeabilization followed by the electrophoretic
transport of negatively charged DNA across the permeabilized cells.23−25 Due to the Joule heating effects,26 the
method although having good yield had severe limitations of high cell
mortality and subsequent cell lysis. The electrotransfer process has
been well characterized as a multistep process with electropermeabilization
of the cell membrane, anchoring of the plasmid to the permeabilized
cell membrane, and finally the diffusive transport of such plasmid
into the intercellular cytoplasm.27,28 Further, the
electrophoretic component of DNA electrotransfer has been found to
have a significant impact on the overall transformation efficiency.29,30 For example, the use of high-voltage (for membrane permeabilization)
and low-voltage (for electrotransfer) pulses in combination has been
found to produce greater yield than that found using a single high-voltage
pulse.31

Further, in some enterobacterial
species, such as Salmonella typhimurium(32) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,33 the chemical methods of gene transfer
are altogether
ineffective in comparison with some other species like E. coli. For such strains, nonviral vector transformation
method of electroporation has been observed to be an appropriate alternative
that also enriches the vitality of the nonviral transport process.
This electroporation technique also serves as a potent tool to perform
gene transfer in mammalian cells that have further complexity in terms
of transforming DNA across cellular and subsequently another nuclear
membrane.34,35 The transient permeabilization of the plasma
membrane under the influence of an external electric field increases
drastically by the electroporation technique.36 The majority of electroporation techniques are mainly based on the
application of short voltage pulses, the precision of which is enhanced
through the designs of microfluidic platforms.37−42 In the majority of such electroporation setups, there is increased
use of direct current (DC) sources. Very few reports indicate the
use of alternative current fields for performing transformation.43−45 The essential design requirement to realize a suitable transformation
method is one that can achieve high targeted yield and overall low
cell mortality. From the above analysis, it is observed that although
the pressure-mediated transformation may have lesser cell mortality,
it has lower targeted yield.

On the other hand, the electroporation
process has a high yield
although it is severely limited by lower viability of transformants.
So, a good method design would need the combination of the best part
of each pressure-mediated and electroporation methods. Also, short
pulse DC signals have shown good yields earlier in terms of targeted
delivery of the transforming DNA.

In this work, we have explored
a hybrid platform that couples intense
mechanical pressure pulses augmented by synchronous electrical pulses
to carry out transformation. The electric pulses are generated in
a time-controlled manner through the circuit, as shown in the Supporting
Information (Figure S1), and have a role
of electrotransfer of transforming DNA apart from augmenting the overall
pressure level. The root mean square voltage magnitude being quite
low does not cause a significant rise in the Joule temperature and
results in targeted delivery and a stable transformation. The mechanical
pressure waves are generated by an ultrahigh-pressure short duration
pulse incident on a thin aluminum–polydimethylsiloxane (Al–PDMS)
membrane. The pulse is produced through the digital combustion of
a nanoengineered composite (comprising of bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3) and nanoaluminum (nAl)) packed within a cylindrical
chamber (volume ∼100 mm3)). The Al–PDMS membrane
further transmits the pulse into the column of a fluid that contains
the mixture of transforming DNA and cells. The pressure rises to a
peak value of 24.3 MPa in the duration of 5.4 μs, as measured
by the pressure sensor situated at the bottom of the cuvette containing
the biofluid column. We have validated this device design through
experimentation related to the transport of GFP plasmid into E. coli BL21 transformants. The transformation efficiency
of the proposed transformation scheme is further compared with the
heat shock method46 and the electroporation
method (on the same set of transforming DNA/cells), and the proposed
methodology is observed to approach similar efficacy levels as high-voltage
electroporation.

Results and Discussion
Theoretical Modeling of
Electrical and Pressure Pulse Propagation
We have observed
that the maximum transformation is achieved with
a combination of 40.8 MPa peak pressure (generated by 25 mg Bi2O3/nAl)49 and an electrical
signal of 5 Vpp. The cell colony counts with varying voltage
are listed in Table 1.

It has been observed that at 5 Vpp significant cell
transformation events take place. Below this voltage, there is no
significant transformation. We have further performed a comparison
of this new electromechanically coupled process with the heat shock
method for bacterial transformation, which is an industry gold standard
for transformation processes,46 and also
with electroporation processes. It has been observed that the synchronously
acting electromechanical pressure generated in our device is quite
efficient in producing transformants higher than the heat shock method,
which is almost similar to electroporation processes. The total time
for this electromechanical process is around 500 μs, whereas
the other standard methods may take several hours.46 Therefore, the described technique of applying electromechanical
shocks is undoubtedly novel and is an effective method to produce
rapid transformations within microorganisms.

Figure 2b shows
a pressure rise at the bottom of the cuvette, which reaches to 24.3
MPa, as sensed by the pressure sensor. The pressure–time characteristics
also indicate an exponential blast pressure–time response containing
a sharp pressure rise followed by a decay in the pressure at a slow
pace. This specific pressure–time behavior ensures the quick
pressurization and a delayed depressurization of the chamber, which
gives enough response time to the electric field (just after the half-maxima
point). So in the following section, theoretical modeling is carried
out to analyze the impact of the electromechanical wave on the mixture
of bacterial cells and plasmid. The Al–PDMS membrane can be
envisaged to behave like a fixed elastic membrane, positioned normally
to the pressure wave (with the Al foil facing the blast side and PDMS
facing the biofluidic column side) and is approximated to expand similarly
as a freestanding plate.51 The exponential
blast effect on the membrane is approximated by52 1  where pi is the
incident pressure at any time t, pm is the maximum incident blast over pressure, and tdt is the wave decay period, which we have approximated
to be equal to full width half-maxima time (tfwhm) of normalized pressure–time response. Shock wave
density ρs and shock wave velocity Us that reach the assembly are estimated by the Rankine–Hugoniot
relation.51,52 2   3  In the above equations, ρa is the density of air, pa is the atmospheric
pressure, and γ is the specific heat ratio for air blast. From eqs 2 and 3, the theoretical shock wave velocity is calculated as 6331.124 m/s.

Below this shock wave, the Al–PDMS assembly is situated
in a manner so that it transfers the shock wave to the biofluidic
column with velocity vm and through this shock wave, the fluid gets an initial (at time t = 0 s) momentum with velocity vm, membrane velocity. We have further assumed that
the biofluidic media is water like, with a very small change in density
and sonic velocity even after getting loaded with plasmids.

The total pressure transmitted through the Al–PDMS assembly
is calculated through the transmittance coefficient for different
interfaces: first, the air–Al interface; second, the Al–PDMS
interface, and the third being the PDMS–water (biofluidic medium)
interface. The transmittance coefficient Tp is given by53 4  where Z (acoustic impedance)
= ρc, ρ is the medium density, and c is the velocity of sound in that medium. Considering the
properties53 as mentioned in the Supporting
Information (Table S1) of different mediums,
the transmittance coefficient has been calculated.

From eqs 1 and 4, the total maximum theoretical pressure at PDMS-biofluidic
medium is calculated as 22.11 MPa (calculations are detailed in the Supporting Information), which is the approximate
solution to what we have sensed using a pressure sensor. Further,
on the basis of acoustic approximation, the water particle velocity
can be theoretically estimated according to Deshpande et al.52 as 5  Through
this formula, membrane velocity vm after
traveling through the Al–PDMS
assembly is found to be 14.1 m/s (cl is
the sound velocity in biofluid and ρl is the biofluid
density). The expression of motion of the membrane is developed by
modifying the equation of striker formulated by Deshpande et al.52 6  In this equation, m is the
mass per unit area of the striker (m = ρm × tm) and ρm and tm are the density and thickness
of the striker, respectively. In the present study, as the striker
constitutes the Al–PDMS assembly, the total mass per unit area
is combined. Solving the equation by putting the initial boundary
condition, at t = 0 and v = vm, the pressure p(t) at x = 0 can be expressed as 7  For the condition that fluid particles are
moving at a constant velocity cl, the
pressure at position x, where x is
the length of the column (x = 8 mm) can be expressed
as 8  The maximum pressure should be sensed at time t = 0 s (in eq 8), but
as our pressure sensor is mounted on the other end of the
fluid column, we get the maximum pressure as 24.3 MPa (which is nearly
similar to the theoretical value) sensed by the pressure sensor from
the bottom after a time delay of t = 5.4 μs.

From the above theoretical modeling, it can be observed that the
pressure generated through the pressurized mechanical pulse is much
greater than the elastic modulus of E. coli cells, which is 3 MPa54 in wet conditions.
Hence, the transformation occurs easily as the pressure pulse is applied.
As a significant 200 MPa pressure with multiple passes is required
to make the E. coli bacteria completely
dead,55 our system works in a permissible
range avoiding complete cell lysis. For the electric pulse-assisted
case, as the plasmid mixed bacterial cells undergo a high pressure
initially through a blast, the requirement of the higher electric
field, to the level of electroporation processes may not be needed
(the applied electric field between electrodes ≥ 6.25 kV/cm)
for transforming E. coli.24 As per the theoretical formulation, electric
field requirement for transformation to occur is given by the Laplace
equation 9  where U is
the transmembrane
voltage, r is the cell radius, and θ is the
angle between the static external electric field (E) and site of the membrane where the potential U is measured.56 At the poles (θ
= 0, π), 75% of the voltage drop occurs in the membrane and
hence the amplification factor, Em/E (Em is a transmembrane electric
field) is given by Em/E = 1.5r/h (h is
the cell membrane thickness), which comes out to be 600 for E. coli (where r ≈ 2 μm
and h ≈ 5 nm57).
In the present study, an optimized low voltage of 5 V (applied electric
field between electrodes, E = 20 kV/m) is used, which
has caused significant gene transformation. This applied field has
generated an approximate Em = 12 000
kV/m (Umax (at θ=0, π) = 60 mV), which attains efficient gene transformation when the bacteria
is held in a 100 mM CaCl2 solution with a high initial
blast pressure. All experiments have been carried out in the cuvette
maintained at 0 °C. Hence, the transformation is achieved with
a voltage, that is ≈31 times less than the reported ones.

Due to the application of the synchronized pressure and electric
pulses, the period during which the pressure in the system remains
above the elastic limit of E. coli cells
increases and simultaneously transformation levels also increase.
Hence, the pressure generated via combining mechanical shock and an
electrical field is highly efficacious for the bacterial transformation
process.

Although the mechanical pressure is enough to open
the pores of
the membrane, the generated flux is primarily a diffusional flux.
So mainly it is the passive mode of transport of the transforming
DNA that is responsible for the transformation. When an additional
electric field is applied, there is electrophoretic transport that
results in an overall mobility increase. Thus, it can be seen that
even at a low electric field of 20 kV/m, enough payload delivery gets
initiated and a vast majority of the transforming DNA can enter the
cells.

Transformation of E. coli BL21
The coupling of the mechanical pressure wave with the electric
field-induced pressure is used for transformation of E. coli BL21 (a gram-negative bacteria) with GFP-based
transforming DNA. We have not conducted any studies through Gram-positive
bacteria as that will require separate optimization of pressure/electric
pulse combination for transformation. Figure 1 represents a schematic (a) and an actual
picture (b) of the fabricated device.

Figure 1 (a) Overall schematic of subsequent events
of bacterial gene transformation.
(b) Fabricated setup used for bacterial gene transformation.

A small amount of Bi2O3/nAl nanoenergetic
composite (25 mg) is packed inside the combustion chamber (∼100
mm3 volume) of the device where a nichrome wire element
is digitally triggered to cause microignition of the confined charge
inside this device. Among the pressure–time characteristics
of various nanoenergetic systems, such as CuO nanorods/Al,47 Co3O4 nanobelts/Al,48 and Bi2O3 nanosquare tablets/Al49 the Bi2O3 nanosquare tablets/Al
nanoenergetic material possesses the highest pressurization rates.
We have earlier evaluated the pressure–time characteristics
of bulk nanoenergetic material using commercially available Bi2O3 and Al nanoparticles by igniting 30 mg of this
mixture in a pressure cell (Figure 2a).47,48 The pressure–time characteristic of the Bi2O3/nAl nanoenergetic composite, as sensed by the pressure sensor
situated at the bottom of the cuvette, is shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) Pressure–time
characteristic measurement setup. (b)
Pressure–time characteristics of Bi2O3/nAl nanoenergetics experienced by the fluid.

When the Bi2O3/nAl nanoenergetic composite
packed inside the ignition chamber is digitally triggered, a high
magnitude of pressure is released. This pressure wave is guided to
be incident to Al–PDMS assembled membrane which partitions
the ignition chamber from the fluid column present in the cuvettelike
portion of the device. The Al–PDMS layer also prevents cross-contamination
between the fluid and the nanoenergetic pellets by blocking the reaction
products from falling into the biofluid column. The mechanical pressure
wave generated inside the device cavity incident to the Al–PDMS
layer transfers the pressure wave to the fluid column, where the sudden
hammering of the Al–PDMS membrane with an impact at a high
blast pressure increases the local pressure of the fluid almost instantaneously.
The pressure rise within this fluid column is measured by placing
a pressure sensor at the end opposite to the membrane end of this
architecture. The maximum pressure is sensed to be around 24.3 MPa
with 25 mg of Bi2O3/nAl (Figure 2b) nanoenergetic composite during the transformation
procedure. The electric signal is initiated at a delay of ≈85
μs toward the end of the full width half-maxima point of the
pressure signal electronically through an in-house developed timing
circuit (Figure S1).

We have thoroughly
mixed DNA and E. coli cells before
the application of electric and pressure pulses. Then,
the mixture is kept in the cuvette of the device to carry out the
transformation. Here, we hypothesize that the electric field pulse
leads to the anchoring of the plasmid across the cell membrane and
the plasmid is then slowly translocated through the membrane into
the cytoplasm. As described earlier, the plasmid is affected by simultaneous
treatment of the mechanical and the electrical pressure waves. It
is a very well-known phenomenon that when a cell is treated with an
electric field, the area of the cell membrane that faces the electrodes
gets affected more.44 According to our
hypothesis, the DNA adheres to the cell membrane and makes a strong
interaction with the membrane after the application of the electric
pulse. We have observed that the maximum cell viability and the most
significant number of transformations occur at a DC pulse width of
500 μs. The solution volume that has been used in our studies
is around 100 μL, and the chamber has been designed in a manner
so that it can provide a homogenous electric field to the mixture
of cells and plasmid. In the case the field applied is nonhomogenous,
there may be a possibility of dielectrophoresis and cells sticking
to the surface. Researchers have shown earlier that DNA will observe
dielectrophoretic effects at a low signal frequency.50

Calculation of the Transformation Efficiency
The transformation
efficiency of the process is observed by standardized plating and
culture method over ampicillin-Luria Bertani (LB) agar plates. Hundred
microliters of the transformed cell solution is plated on the LBamp plate for counting purpose. The full-grown plates are visualized
under a UV transilluminator, and the images are captured through the
camera. The colony counting process is automated by importing high-resolution
JPEG files of the full-grown plates into ImageJ (Courtesy: NIH) software
and performing a particle count on the number of colonies. Figure 3 shows the number
of transformed cells through different transformation schemes (i.e.,
heat shock method, pressure pulse-assisted method, electric pulse-assisted
method, combined electrical and pressure pulse-assisted method, and
electroporation). Electric pulse-assisted (5 V) and pressure pulse-assisted
(24.3 MPa pressure pulse) transformations present transformation at
the individual pulse condition of the synchronized pulse.

a UV transilluminator (dilution factor = 40, counts reported using
ImageJ in colony forming units) for (a, b) control sample 1 and 2;

at 5 VDC: sample 1 and 2; (i, j) transformed cells via coupled mechanical
and electrical pressure pulse: sample 1 and 2; (k, l) transformed
cells via electroporation.

Through these cell counts, cell transformation efficiency
(in CFU/μg)
of the individual transformation processes is calculated and represented
in Figure 4 (with around
a 95% confidence interval). The transformation efficiency of the E. coli BL21 as obtained in the current study is
in good agreement with the reported literature.58

Figure 4 Transformation efficiency related to various transformation schemes
(corresponding to three repetitions).

As can be observed from the transformation efficiency plot,
the
transformation efficiency of the pressurized pulse-assisted transformation
(0.68 ± 0.034 × 108 CFU/μg) is almost twice
as compared to that of the electric pulse-assisted transformation
method (0.34 ± 0.017 × 108 CFU/μg), confirming
that the standalone pressure pulse-assisted transformation is more
effective than the 5 V electrical pulse-assisted transformation. It
can also be observed that these two transformation schemes are quite
low in terms of efficiency as compared with the heat shock method
(1.3 ± 0.065 × 108 CFU/μg), whereas synchronized
pulse (pressure and electric field)-assisted transformation and electroporation
are much more efficient than the heat shock method. The transformation
efficiency of the synchronized pulse-assisted transformation (the
reported transformation scheme) is observed to be 3 ± 0.15 ×
108 CFU/μg, which is quite similar to the efficacy
of the electroporation method (2.93 ± 0.14 × 108 CFU/μg). This confirms that the reported methodology obtains
an effective transformation yield, which can be achieved without the
need for the very high electric field as used in electroporation,
which in turn induces Joule heating and higher cell mortality. The
high transformation yield has become possible due to the high-pressure
pulse, which opens the pores of the membrane and facilitates the passive
transport of DNA that is being further assisted by the smooth electrophoretic
transport of this DNA by the use of a low electric field. It can also
be observed that as the Joule heating is reduced, the cell mortality
is also reduced and the viable cell count is obtained to be higher
in the reported method as compared with electroporation (discussed
in detail in the next section).

We have also performed confocal
imaging of GFP plasmid-transformed E. coli cells for further validation of the cell
transformation. For carrying out confocal imaging, a single grown
colony is picked from the plated transformed cells and is further
grown in LB media. As and when the growth is observed, the cells are
washed multiple times with Milli-Q water. Five microliters of cells
is dropped on the clean glass slide without any additional staining
step and covered with a glass coverslip for confocal imaging. Figure 5 depicts FITC, differential
interference contrast (DIC), and combined images of FITC/DIC, which
confirms that the E. coli cells are
transformed with GFP plasmid.

coli cells showing GFP expression at 40×. (b)

bright field at 40×. (c) Showing intensity of GFP expression
in cells (combined images (a) and (b)).

Cell Viability Study
The cell viability is observed
to be strongly influenced by the transformation process and is observed
by plating 100 μL of the cell solution before and after transformation
on an LB agar plate. Figure 6 shows the CFU images of the cell solution before and after
the transformation process on the LB plate. Table 2 presents the viable cell count related to
different transformation schemes. It can be observed from the transformation
scheme that the transformation efficiency of the reported method is
almost comparable to that of the electroporation method whereas the
viability of the cells through the reported method is better than
that of the electroporation. The viability test has shown that the
heat shock method shows higher viability as compared with the synchronized
pulse-assisted transformation and electroporation.

Conclusions
The standalone mechanical
and pressure waves have not demonstrated
sufficient bacterial transformation. However, the bacterial transformation
has been observed to be enhanced by the coupling of the mechanical
and electrical pressure waves in unison. When an appropriate mechanical
pressure pulse in combination with an electric pulse is transmitted
to the biological fluid, the transformation yield can be improved
significantly. This optimum transformation condition in our case has
been obtained by triggering an ignition of 25 mg of the confined nanoenergetic
composite and a 5 VDC potential being applied in a time-controlled
manner. It can be intuitively understood that the bacterial cells
within the fluidic environment experience different magnitudes of
mechanical pressure in various areas along the membrane surface mainly
as they are oriented differently about the pressure front. Hence,
the localized mechanical pressure interacting with the particular
bacterial cell should be enough to damage some portions of the cell
membrane, which are incident to this pressure wave. From a theoretical
perspective, it has been observed that the electrical pressure wave
helps assist the mechanical pressure on the cellular membrane and
also induces electrophoretic transportation of the negatively charged
transforming DNA more effectively. The reported methodology has shown
a good order of magnitude of the transformation efficiency as compared
with the heat shock method or electroporation method.

Additionally,
the cell viability that is observed is higher than
the electroporation. The overall advantage that we perceive through
this process is a definite reduction in time of transformation than
other established techniques like heat shock or electroporation. Thus,
the reported technology has shown efficacies of transformation similar
to other standard methods.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Nanoenergetic
Composites
Nanothermite
composites have been prepared by ultrasonic mixing of 200 mg of Bi2O3 nanoparticles of average diameter of 90–210
nm (procured from Sigma-Aldrich, India) with 50 mg of Al nanopowder
of average diameter of 80 nm (procured from Neo Ecosystem Pvt Ltd
India) in isopropyl alcohol (30 mL) in a Sonics Vibra-Cell ultrasonic
processor (model VCX130, 130 W, 20 kHz, Sonics & Materials, Inc.).
The ultrasonication process disperses and breaks apart the agglomerates
of Bi2O3 and Al nanoparticles and promotes homogeneous
mixing. The ultrasonication process has been continued for ∼10
min in this synthesis by keeping the on–off pulsing time equal
to 10 s to avoid any thermal gradient within the solution. Finally,
the isopropyl alcohol is evaporated by drying the well-homogenized
slurry at 90 °C in a hot air oven and the dried powder is extracted
and immediately kept under vacuum to avoid any moisture absorption.

Device Design and Fabrication
The schematic of the
synchronous electromechanical pressure generator is shown in Figure 1a, and the actual
fabricated device is shown in Figure 1b. The device has been developed by assembling two
cylindrical parts fabricated in mild steel.

Realization of the Upper
Die
The upper part is a small
cylindrical chamber of 100 mm3 volume containing a pressurized
pellet of the nanoenergetic composite. The upper part also consists
of two 1 mm diameter holes to hold ignition electrodes to set off
the fitted charge as machined by electric discharge machining (EDM).
The insulated ignition needle electrodes are plugged with nichrome
wires and are connected to an external DC voltage supply through an
ON/OFF switch.

Realization of the Lower Die
In
the lower part of the
device, a rectangular slot (width x length x height: 20 x 27 x 20
cm3) is machined through EDM for placing the cuvette containing
the mixture of cells and GFP plasmid. A through hole of diameter 5
mm perpendicular to the width of the rectangular slot is made for
providing external electrical connections to the cuvette electrode.
The lower part also carries a slot at the bottom of the device for
mounting the pressure sensor (PCB119B12) and a thin cylindrical cavity
at the top for housing the separator membrane (Al–PDMS assembly
brought together in contact without any air gap).

Reusable and
economic PDMS cuvettes have been fabricated through a replication
and molding technique, which eventually go into the slot of the cuvette
in the lower member for containing the fluid column (a mixture of
cells and plasmid). Two Al foils are attached in the middle portion
of the replica-molded PDMS (cuvette) for acting as electrodes to generate
an electric pulse. The cuvette further comprises of two PDMS layers
of different compositions. The one containing a 10:1 ratio (of silicone
elastomer and curing agent from Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland)
occupies a significant portion of the wall thickness of the cuvette,
by the side of the Al electrodes (Figure 1b). It is used for providing strength to
the containment of the cuvette, whereas another layer comprising of
a 40:1 ratio occupies the bottom portion of the cuvette to allow the
transfer of the pressure pulse effectively to the pressure sensor.
The central idea behind fabricating this twin layer cuvette is to
be able to transfer the pressure wave quickly through the significantly
softer layer of PDMS to the pressure sensor that is fitted at the
bottom end of the cuvette. The task of the harder layer is to primarily
provide a leakage-free containment for the biological fluid in the
postblast highly pressurized environment of the chamber. A diffusion/intermixing
layer developed in the interface of the two layers eliminates the
need for any adhesive joint between the layers.

Assembly
of Upper and Lower Dies
The Al (thickness
0.5 mm)-PDMS (thickness 3 mm) membrane separates the cuvette from
the nanoenergetic composite and transfers the pressure of the blast
to the mixture of cells and plasmid immediately underneath it. This
isolating PDMS layer has been prepared using a ratio of 40:1 of silicone
elastomer and a curing agent. The upper and lower halves are held
to each other by screw threads after putting in place all contents
of this device, like nanoenergetic composite pellet, separator membrane,
cells, plasmid, etc. The rugged design of this device helps in containing
the blast effect sustainably so that the mechanical pressure generated
out of the ignition of the nanothermite pellet is focused onto the
mixture of cells and plasmid with minimal dissipation.

Pulse
Generator Circuit
A pulse generator circuit (shown
in Figure S1) is further prepared to feed
the electrical signal using an 8 pin 555 IC with variable resistance R and capacitance C, which will delay the
timing of the output commensurate with the time needed for the full
width half-maxima point of the mechanical pressure pulse. The output
(pin number 3) of the IC is connected to the Gate of an IRF 530 metal–oxide–semiconductor
field-effect transistor (MOSFET), which is used as a switch for the
external voltage applied across the cuvette electrodes. The external
voltage is provided by the voltage generator, and its positive terminal
is connected to the drain of the MOSFET through a diode and resistance.
The electrical output to the cuvette is taken from the Source of the
MOSFET and the negative terminal of the external voltage source. The
pulsed voltage is varied from 0 to 10 VDC. The whole circuit is operated
by a 10 VDC battery. We have performed simulations of the planned
circuit through LTSPICE before actual fabrication of the circuitry.

Pressure Measurement
The magnitude of the pressure
pulse is sensed at the bottom of the cuvette containing the mixture
of cells and plasmid using a pressure sensor (PCB119B12) inserted
at the lower end of the cuvette with its sensing wires coming out
of the device. The leads of this sensor are attached to an oscilloscope,
and the pressure transmitted by the liquid column is recorded with
the digital oscilloscope (DPO 3054).

Cells and Plasmid Preparation
E. coli BL21 (genotype: F–ompT hsdSB (rB–, mB–) gal
dcm (DE3)) strain
with GFP plasmid has been used for bacterial transformation. The bacterial
cells are grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C. Antibiotic
ampicillin (100 μg/mL) has been used for selecting the transformed
cells. The cells used in the experiments are freshly prepared competent
cells that are grown to a level such that their optical density (OD600)
is recorded as ∼0.4–0.6. For preparing the chemically
competent cells, the grown bacterial cells are washed multiple times
with PBS buffer and centrifuged at 4000g for 15 min.
The chemically competent cells are finally suspended in 100 mM CaCl2 medium and kept on ice for an hour before use, and then transformation
experiments are carried out. For preparing the electrocompetent cells,
the grown bacterial cells are washed several times with 10% glycerol
and centrifuged at 4000g for 15 min. The electrocompetent
cells are finally suspended in 10% glycerol only. GFP plasmid (∼4
kb, 40 pg/μL) (SKU: KT60) was purchased from Genei, Bangalore,
India. It comprises of a GFP gene (isolated from a bioluminescent
jellyfish Aequorea victoria) insert
cloned into a pUC18 vector under constitutive expression. GFP is mainly
chosen for the experiment to increase the visualization of the cells.

Bacterial Transformation Using Electromechanical Pressure Waves
A simple and unique technique to create pressure waves using nanothermite
and simultaneous use of a low-intensity electric field has been developed.
One microliter of the purified plasmid is mixed into 100 μL
of cells, and this mixture is pipetted inside the cuvette. The pressure
waves are produced inside the steel chamber by igniting the nanothermite
and simultaneously applying the electric field through the switching
circuit as described above. After the experiment, the transformed
cells are pipetted out from the cuvette and are directly plated on
ampicillin (100 μg/mL)-nutrient agar (LBamp) plates
at different dilutions. The agar plates are then kept at 37 °C
for 18 h. The experiments are confirmed at the end, by observing fluorescence-labeled
colonies under the UV transilluminator and processing the collected
JPEG images through ImageJ software. The mixture of bacterial cells
along with plasmid that is kept at room temperature for the time corresponding
to the transformation time of the reported transformation scheme,
without any exposure to mechanical/electrical pressure waves, is used
as a control sample. Figure 3 represents the images corresponding to two different samples
for each transformation condition (control, heat shock method, mechanical
pressure pulse assisted, electric pulse assisted, electromechanically
pressurized pulse assisted and electroporation). Each experiment is
repeated three times with separately grown identical cells and GFP
plasmid. Corresponding error bars for the transformation efficiency
for all cases have been depicted in Figure 4.

Electroporation has been performed
on a MicroPulser Electroporator, Bio-Rad Laboratories, California
using Ec1 Mnemonic for E. coli (18
kV/cm) with the prepared electrocompetent cells.
