Amorphous silicon nitride (α-SiNx) films were coated on a photonic crystal-laser diode by the
radio
frequency magnetron sputtering method. Sputtering deposition conditions
were changed to obtain α-SiNx films
with different properties. The optical parameters and morphologies
of the products were systemically characterized by spectroscopic ellipsometry
fitting, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy,
and performance of LDs coated with α-SiNx films were tested at 25 °C. Physical mechanisms of sputtering
were explained in detail. α-SiNx with a band gap of 4.4 eV and a refractive index of 2.03 at 980
nm were grown. The extinction coefficient equal to 0 at 980 nm, and
the surface morphology tended to be homogeneous and dense. The main
influencing factors related to the catastrophic optical mirror damage
(COMD) phenomenon were investigated. Then plasma pretreatment was
implemented to eliminate defects and improve the cavity surface quality
and further optimized by measuring the intensity of photoluminescence.
Afterward, a rapid annealing method was also carried out to improve
coating performance. Finally, α-SiNx acted as a passivation layer in the antireflection film coated on
the LD facet, and the COMD threshold increased from 5 to 15.2 W, which
led to a higher reliability than nonoptimized LDs and elimination
of the COMD phenomenon.

1 Introduction
Catastrophic optical mirror
damage (COMD) is an important factor
that limits the maximum output of high-power semiconductor laser diodes
(LDs) and endangers the safety of the LD system. For GaAs-based LDs,
when its natural cleavage surface is exposed to air, is easily oxidized
to form Ga2O3 and As2O3. These oxides become nonradiative recombination centers and generate
many surface energy levels.1−3 Especially when the semiconductor
LD works at a high power, these nonradiative recombination centers
absorb photons, resulting in the huge generation of heat. Then the
thermal effect causes bandgap shrinkage of the semiconductor materials
in the LD facet, which accelerates surface material oxidation and
generates more nonradiative recombination centers, further increasing
the absorption of photons. There is a cyclical growth of light absorption,
heat accumulation, and bandgap shrinking. Finally, COMD occurs when
the surface temperature reaches the melting point and provokes thermal
runaway, causing irreversible and permanent damage to the device.4−6

At present, for the purpose of increasing the COMD threshold
of
LDs, the passivation film is usually coated on the semiconductor-cleaved
surface to alleviate surface oxidation and guarantee the safety of
the laser system. Silicon nitride is an excellent passivating material
on account of their excellent properties such as wide bandgap (>4.0
eV), good moisture resistance, high thermal stability, and mechanical
hardness, which attracted the attention of many researchers. As the
passivation film, SiNx can increase the
lifetime of the LD by 15 times than ZnSe7 and contains less Ga–O and As–O than Al2O3, which is expected to have a better passivation effect
on the LD facet. It has been reported that AlN increased the power
by 30% to 1.8 W,21 which need to be further
improved. The COMD threshold of ZnSe coated on a 915 nm laser was
14.8 W.22 In our group, Al2O3 was used as the passivation layer on the photonic crystal-LD
(PC-LD), and the maximum continuous output power was 7.3 W.23

Various techniques have been applied to
grow passivation films
on cleavage surfaces to prevent oxidation and improve the interface
quality of LDs. Considering that atomic layer deposition technology
needs complex equipment and the process temperature is over 500 °C,
which may accelerate cavity surface oxidation and affect the lifetime
of LDs,8,9 the wet sulfur-solution method takes a long
time and has a poor stability in the passivation process.10 We put forward radio frequency (RF) magnetron
sputtering as the passivation method, which is a cost- and time-effective
technology and has a suitable film growth rate as well as convenient
materials and equipment. In the past years, the optical properties
of thin film materials and RF magnetron sputtering technology have
been studied,11−13 and the porosity of silicon nitride thin films was
controlled by changing the chamber temperature, gas mixing ratio,
distance between the target and substrate, constant power supply voltage,
and so on.14−16 Therefore, a systematic research of the relationship
between properties of magnetron sputtering films and their performance
on LDs is highly needed.

This paper focuses on the influence
of RF magnetron sputtering
deposition conditions on the properties of amorphous silicon nitride
(α-SiNx) thin films, establishing
a correlation between the optical properties of α-SiNx and the COMD phenomenon of LDs. In the end, the
optical power of LDs coated with α-SiNx increased by more than three times than that of uncoated LDs.

2 Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 2, the refractive index of the SiNx film
increases from 1.84 to 2.04 at a wavelength
of 980 nm with different electron gun power from 1200 to 1500 W. Because
increasing the electron gun power will sputter out more silicon atoms,
and the film will be developed toward the Si-rich SiNx film and cause the increase of the refractive index.
However, the refractive index of the film declined to 1.98 at 980
nm when the electron gun power increased to 1600 W. This is due to
the fact that excess silicon atoms sputtered out can increase the
vacancy of the N atom in the lattice, which will reduce the structural
compactness of the film. The extinction coefficient k of the five samples varying with different sputtering power in the
photon energy range from 0.75 to 5 eV is shown in Figure 3. It is clear that α
increases monotonically with the increase of the sputtering power
under the same photon energy. k and the sputtering
power are (10, 1200 W), (260, 1300 W), (300, 1400 W), (320, 1500 W),
(350, 1600 W), respectively, when the photon energy E is 1.24 eV (980 nm lasing wavelength). Because with the increase
of the sputtering power, the sputtered silicon atoms are deposited
on the substrate without sufficient diffusion, making the film to
grow like an island. Therefore, there are many defects on the surface
of the film, which become the auger recombination capable of absorbing
photons. Figure 4 shows
that α increases with the sputtering power in the range of 1200–1600
W. At the same time, Eg decreases with
the sputtering power increasing, which can conclude that α-SiNx begins to change from the nitrogen-rich
type into silicon-rich type. This change may introduce impurities
of uncombined silicon atoms, eventually becoming nonradiative recombination
centers. This opinion can also be proved in Figure 5, the power of the electron gun is 1600 W,
silicon atoms account for 45% of the total number of nitrogen and
silicon atoms. When the power of the electron gun is 1400 W, silicon
atoms account for 37% of the total number of nitrogen and silicon
atoms. When the power of the electron gun is 1000 W, silicon atoms
account for 31% of the total number of nitrogen and silicon atoms.
Therefore, the power of the electron gun has an influence on the composition
of the SiNx film.

power
of (a) 1600, (b) 1400, and (c) 1200 W.

The relationship between the refractive index n of SiNx films and the Ar flow
rate were
investigated, as shown in Figure 6a. With the Ar flow rate increasing, the refractive
index also increases at a wavelength range of 380–1650 nm.
It is because the increase of Ar+ sputters out more silicon
atoms, making the film a silicon-rich silicon nitride with a higher n.

nm for the
SiNx film of the five samples with different
argon flow rates (b) absorption coefficient versus photon energy from
0.75 to 3.25 eV for the SiNx film of the
five samples with different argon flow rates.

The influence of the Ar flow rate in sputtering
ambient on the
absorption coefficient of the prepared film is shown in Figure 6b. With the increase of the
Ar flow rate, α generally followed an increasing trend from
0.75 to 3.25 eV. In terms of 1.24 eV, as illustrated in Figure 6, α is equal to (0 cm–1, 50 sccm), (10 cm–1, 60 sccm),
(170 cm–1, 65 sccm), (420 cm–1, 70 sccm), and (500 cm–1, 75 sccm), respectively.
Because the photon energy is far less than the bandgap of SiNx (approximately 4 eV), the photon absorption
is mainly caused by the excess Si atoms sputtered out, which have
a lower bandgap (1.14 eV).

Figure 7 shows the
influence of the N2 flow rate on the refractive index and
α. The Ar flow rate of the electron gun is set as 50 sccm. In Figure 7a, n decreases with
the N2 flow rate increasing, meaning the film packing density
also decreases with the N2 flow rate. In Figure 7b, α decreases with an
increasing N2 flow rate as well. The surface microstructures
of the α-SiNx samples were observed
by atomic force microscope (AFM), as shown in Figure 8. The size of the scanned area was 10 μm
× 10 μm. The roughness reduced from 0.56 to 0.19 nm as
the N2 flow rate was increased from 8 to 16 sccm. Progressive
homogeneous and densification of the film microstructure occurring
as the N2 flow rate was increased, which was consistent
with previous report.17 The most smooth,
flat surface was obtained when the N2 flow rate was 16
sccm. From these results, we draw a conclusion that the sample with
low roughness has a low absorption coefficient.

nm, N2 flow rate = 12 sccm, (c) roughness = 0.43 nm, N2 flow rate = 10 sccm, and (d) roughness = 0.56 nm, N2 flow rate = 8 sccm.

The influence of the RF power on the refractive
index was investigated,
as shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the n decreases with the increase of the RF power range
from 400 to 500 W, and rise with the increase of the RF power range
from 500 to 600 W. This can be divided into two steps: (1) Si atoms
and N+ have been pushed by high-energy ions, enhancing
the adhesion to the substrate and increasing the structural compactness
of the SiNx film, so n increases; (2)
when further increasing the RF power range from 500 to 600 W, the
increase of the nitrogen ionization rate increases the opportunity
for silicon atoms to combine with N+, so n decreases. Whether the refractive index increases or decreases mainly
depends on which of the above two cases is dominant.

Figure 9 Refractive index versus
wavelength from 380 to 1650 nm for the
SiNx film of the five samples with different
RF powers.

The influence of the chamber temperature on the
refractive index
of the SiNx film is shown in Figure 10. It is observed
that the refractive index decreases with the increase of the chamber
temperature from 25 to 80 °C. Because raising the temperature
will provide the atoms more lateral diffusion energy, and then the
atoms will become mobile and form new dimers.18 But further rising the temperature from 80 to 120 °C, the refractive
index decreases. This is because of the collision between the silicon
atoms is aggravated by the increase of temperature, which reduces
the energy of the silicon atoms when they reach the substrate, and
make the film loose.

chamber temperatures.

3 Application on LD Devices
3.1 Plasma Cleaning Process
Photoluminescence
(PL) spectrum intensity can indicate the passivation efficiency to
some extent.19 In order to investigate
whether surface impurities and oxidation defects have been removed,
three groups of the GaAs substrate bombarded with N2, Ar,
and mixed gas with 70% N2 and 30% Ar were carried out,
after that 30 nm α-SiNx films were
grown on the substrates with the same growth conditions. The PL intensity
of GaAs-coated α-SiNx with different
cleaning gases are clearly shown in Figure 11. When the cleaning time was shorter than
7 min, the Ar cleaning group showed the lowest intensity, which dropped
dramatically for a longer time (from 7 to 30 min). The intensity of
the N2 cleaning group was lower than the mixed gas cleaning
group before 10 min, getting the highest intensity at 15 min. The
mixed gas cleaning group got the highest intensity before 10 min and
there was no significant reduction over 30 min. This was because the
energy of the N plasma is lower than that of the Ar plasma, which
caused no additional defects but a slower cleaning speed. Comparatively
speaking, mixed plasma is suitable for surface cleaning with moderate
energy cleaning and less cleaning time. Therefore, it is advisable
to pretreat the cavity surface with a mixture of N2 and
Ar.

3.2 Results of Laser Performance with α-SiNx as the LD Passivation Film
Four
groups of GaAs-based PC-LDs with different growing conditions of SiNx were fabricated and measured. The LDs were
all the same except the passivation film. The curves of LD output
power versus current with different α are shown in Figure 12. It can be learned
that when α was equal to 0, LDs reached the maximum power, 15.2
W at 16 A, and as the current increases after 16 A, thermal saturation
occurred which resulted in the decline of the power. For LDs coated
with SiNx with an α of 10 cm–1, the maximum power dropped to 14 W and the slope
efficiency of the curve decreased slightly. This is because the premature
occurrence of thermal saturation caused by the increase of photon
absorption. We can draw a conclusion that heat dissipation is a more
important limiting factor than cavity coating. When α increased
to 102 cm–1, COD happened at 8 W, and
the COD threshold decreased to 5 W as α added up to 5 ×
102 cm–1. The absorbed photons caused
heat accumulation to reach the melting point of the cavity surface
material. It can be concluded that α needs to be less than 10
cm–1 to avoid COD that happened for 4 mm long and
90 μm wide high-power semiconductor LDs.

current for the SiNx film of four samples.

3.3 Annealing Effect on LDs Coated with a α-SiNx Thin Film
α-SiNx always contains a few silicon atomic clusters. To
get high optical quality films with lower absorption losses, we used
the rapid anneal method in a hydrogen environment20 to increase film compactness. In Table 2, the annealing time
is 10 min and the hydrogen flow rate is 0.2 sccm. The COMD threshold
increased with raising the temperature when the temperature is below
300 °C and α decreased slightly. The reason may be because
H atoms entered the interface and formed a stable H–Si bond
with residual Si atoms, which reduces the hanging bond. Meanwhile,
there was no significant change for roughness, which proved that the
annealing process with these temperatures does not reconstruct the
lattice.

However, on further elevating the temperature to more
than 350
°C, the COD threshold decreased. The possible reason is that
the oxygen molecules in air form chemical bonds with Ga and As in
the LD facet when above 350 °C, and COD is easy to occur. Therefore,
proper annealing conditions are critical for improving the stability
of the laser film.

4 Conclusions
We introduced the method
of RF plasma-enhanced reactive magnetron
sputtering growing α-SiNx. The effects
of the electron gun power, argon flow rate, nitrogen flow rate, ion
source power, and film growth temperature on the refractive index,
extinction coefficient, surface morphology, and element ratio of the
α-SiNx film were investigated. It
has been proved by experiments that the main factor leading to the
difference of light absorption of the α-SiNx film is the change of the composition ratio of the film. In
addition, we demonstrated a correlation between the COD phenomenon
and parameters of the laser facet passivation film, and the performance
of the products was improved by changing the magnetic conditions and
further optimizing the coating effect with N2/Ar-mixed
plasma treatment and rapid annealing. The α-SiNx thin film with a bandgap of 4.4 eV and a refractive
index of 2.03 at 980 nm were coated on the LD facet, and the extinction
coefficient was equal to 0 at 980 nm, roughness was equal to 0.19
nm. Finally, the LD test result shows that the optimized film has
a remarkable effect on the LD facet to prevent COD, which is greatly
helpful for the stability of the laser system.

5 Computational Methods
The refractive
index n(λ) and the extinction
coefficient k(λ) in the wavelength range of
245–1650 nm can be extracted by spectroscopic ellipsometry
fitting and analyzing by the Cauchy model 1  

In some research the band tail absorption
associated with impurities
has been neglected. In order to characterize the weak absorption in
almost transparent regions, in this paper k was calculated
by using the Urbach equation 2  

The optical absorption coefficient
(α) can be expressed by
using 3  where λ is the wavelength.

The
cavity surface absorption is mainly caused by auger recombination,
and the electron transition is indirect. α caused by the electron
transition can be expressed as 4  where B is a constant and Eg is the bandgap. In terms of indirect transition, n equals to 2. By plotting the correlation curve between
(αhϑ)1/2 and hϑ and taking the point (αhϑ)1/2 = 0 by linear fit close to the absorption edge, the values
of Eg can be calculated.16

6 Experimental Section
We investigated
980 nm PC-LD with a stripe width and cavity length
of LD of 90 μm and 4 mm, respectively. The RF Plasma-enhanced
reactive magnetron sputtering system for the Hengyue vacuum SPT700
model was used to grow the films, the structure diagram of the machine
is shown in Figure 1. First, plasma pretreatment has been implemented to eliminate defects
and improve the cavity surface quality. After that, SiNx films with different α were coated on the
LD facets. Then Ta2O5 and SiO2 films
were grown on SiNx in succession. The
magnetic field intensity of the interface as well as absorption related
to the thickness of the film should be reduced as much as possible,
so 30 nm SiNx was grown. According to
the reflectivity formula relating to the maximum light extraction
efficiency of LDs,24 the reflectivity of
the three-layer films was set to 1%. Finally, post annealing treatment
were used to improve the film quality.

In our experiment, the
target material (Si target with purity of
99.99%) was bombarded by an electron gun with Ar+, producing
Si atoms. At the same time, N2 gas was ionized into N+ by an RF ion source and accelerated by a magnetic field,
then the Si atoms combined with N+ to form α-SiNx and pushed to the substrate by ionized ions. Table 1 lists the process
parameters. To a certain extent, the refractive index reveals the
structural compactness and stoichiometry of the film, and the extinction
coefficient reflects the selective absorption of the electromagnetic
wave by matter. Therefore, we mainly focused on the effect of process
parameters on the film refractive index and extinction coefficient,
both the absorption coefficient and bandgap can be calculated.
