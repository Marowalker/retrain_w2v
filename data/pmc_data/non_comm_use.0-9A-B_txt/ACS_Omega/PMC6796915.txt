A novel sky-blue-emitting tripyrenylpyridine
derivative, 2,4,6-tri(1-pyrenyl)pyridine (2,4,6-TPP), has been synthesized
using a Suzuki coupling reaction and compared with three previously
reported isomeric dipyrenylpyridine (DPP) analogues (2,4-di(1-pyrenyl)pyridine
(2,4-DPP), 2,6-di(1-pyrenyl)pyridine (2,6-DPP), and 3,5-di(1-pyrenyl)pyridine
(3,5-DPP)). As revealed by single-crystal X-ray analysis and computational
simulations, all compounds possess highly twisted conformations in
the solid state with interpyrene torsional angles of 42.3°–57.2°.
These solid-state conformations and packing variations of pyrenylpyridines
could be correlated to observed variations in physical characteristics
such as photo/thermal stability and spectral properties, but showed
only marginal influence on electrochemical properties. The novel derivative,
2,4,6-TPP, exhibited the lowest degree of crystallinity as revealed
by powder X-ray diffraction analysis and formed amorphous thin films
as verified using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering. This
compound also showed high thermal/photo stability relative to its
disubstituted analogues (DPPs). Thus, a nondoped organic light-emitting
diode (OLED) prototype was fabricated using 2,4,6-TPP as the emissive
layer, which displayed a sky-blue electroluminescence with Commission
Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.34).
This OLED prototype achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency
of 6.0 ± 1.2% at 5 V. The relatively high efficiency for this
simple-architecture device reflects a good balance of electron and
hole transporting ability of 2,4,6-TPP along with efficient exciton
formation in this material and indicates its promise as an emitting
material for design of blue OLED devices.

==== Body
Introduction
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) occupy
a significant niche in organic semiconductor-based technology, representing
a promising means for next-generation electronic displays and solid-state
lighting. Accordingly, an estimated global market share of $9.6 billion
is expected by the year 2020 for OLEDs.1 Perceived popularity of OLED displays over liquid-crystal displays
is attributable to numerous cutting-edge advantages offered by OLEDs
such as lower power consumption, self-emission, a greater color gamut,
high resolution, high contrast, light weight, flexibility, transparency,
and broader viewing angles.1,2 Full color OLED displays
often require emitters for the three primary colors of red, green,
and blue. However, an intrinsically wide highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy
gap of blue emitters causes inefficient charge injection and rapid
deterioration of the emissive layer upon excitation.3,4 Consequently, blue emitters typically show inferior operational
lifetime, efficiency, and color purity than red and green emitters.1 Thus, limited availability of efficient, photothermally
and chemically stable, spectrally pure, and highly processable organic
blue emitters constitutes a major challenge for the progress of OLED
technology. Unfortunately, this is a widespread problem among blue
emitters with many variations in molecular designs including polymers,
oligomers, dendrimers, organometallics, and small organic molecules.4 Among these molecular designs, small-molecule
organic blue emitters have some distinct advantages including ease
of synthesis, purification, characterization, modification, and OLED
fabrication.3,4 A large fraction of these small-molecule
organic blue emitters are derived from polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
based luminophores such as anthracene, phenanthrene, fluorene, pyrene,
carbazole, and indenopyrazine.3−6 Among these luminophores, pyrene
provides great potential for fabrication of OLEDs blue emitters owing
to its high thermal and photo stabilities, favorable charge carrier
properties, and spectral characteristics.5,7 Consequently,
a number of pyrene derivatives have already been reported as blue/green
OLED emitters7−12 as well as charge injectors/transporters in OLEDs.7,13−18 More importantly, pyrene derivatives can be designed
as multifunctional p-type, n-type, or bipolar emitters, ensuring an
efficient and balanced flux of charges to the emissive layer even
with relatively simple device architectures.3,7

A major challenge with many pyrene-based emissive materials is controlling
undesirable excimer formation, particularly in the condensed state.
The nearly planar aromatic conjugated ring system of pyrene readily
undergoes π–π stacking and consequent excimer formation.
As a result, emission of most pyrene derivatives exhibits significant
red shifts and often demonstrates aggregation-caused quenching, which
affects color purity and device efficiency.19−21 A notable exception for the aggregation-caused
quenching of fluorescent dyes is an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)
effect, which shows restriction of intramolecular rotation in the
solid state, thus improving emission efficiency in the solid state.22,23 Despite obvious advantages of AIE materials, they often contain
chemically less stable aliphatic double bonds and/or heteroatomic
functional groups.22,23 Therefore, our research has focused
on emitters based on chemically stable PAH ring systems, such as pyrenylpyridines
discussed herein.

For non-AIE molecules that consist of multiple
pyrene moieties, mutually twisting these intramolecular pyrene units
is found to be effective for reducing dye aggregation in the solid
state because of increased steric hindrance that prevents face-to-face
pyrene aggregation.17,20,24 For
this reason, molecules with multiple pyrenyl moieties can be designed
in such a way that the pyrene units are attached to rigid bridging
molecular platforms, for example, benzene, calixarene, and octavinylsilsesquioxane.17,20,24 These molecular designs provide
sufficient steric strain to mutually twist the pyrene units into a
nearly orthogonal conformation with respect to each other. These twisted
conformations electronically isolate individual pyrene moieties within
each molecule to minimize extended conjugation, as well as reduce
solid-state intermolecular π–π stacking as a result
of steric hindrance.17,20,24 Accordingly,
such molecular designs confine the luminophore emission largely within
the blue region of electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), while minimizing
aggregation-caused quenching.17

In
the study reported herein, four pyrenylpyridines were used as model
compounds to evaluate the structure–property relationships
in pyrene-containing small organic molecules. Among these pyrenylpyridines,
2,4-di(1-pyrenyl)pyridine (2,4-DPP), 2,6-di(1-pyrenyl)pyridine (2,6-DPP),
and 3,5-di(1-pyrenyl)pyridine (3,5-DPP), each possessing two pyrene
units, are thus collectively referred to as dipyrenylpyridines (DPPs),
whereas 2,4,6-tri(1-pyrenyl)pyridine (2,4,6-TPP) has three pyrene
units. In addition, molecular symmetry of these structural isomers
shows much diversity with 2,4-DPP being asymmetric, while 2,6-DPP,
3,5-DPP, and 2,4,6-TPP each display a formal plane of symmetry. The
pyridine unit is used as a bridging moiety to induce enough steric
strain to intramolecularly twist the pyrenyl moieties for control
of dye aggregation.

During the course of this study, it was
noted that despite the significantly twisted conformations of pyrenylpyridines,
π–π stacking occurs in the solid state to varying
degrees, depending on a multitude of factors such as molecular symmetry,
solid-state conformation, and the extent of inter- and intramolecular
interactions between pyrene units. As a result, solid-state characteristics
of pyrenylpyridines, including absorption and photoluminescence spectra,
fluorescence lifetimes, photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs),
melting points, thermal decomposition onset temperatures, and the
degree of crystallinity, were found to be significantly different
among these compounds, despite their structural similarities.

It is noted that the DPP compounds, 3,5-DPP and 2,6-DPP, have been
previously reported as electron-transporting materials, and 2,4-DPP
has been previously mentioned in a few patents.13,25,26 However, to the best of our knowledge, these
compounds have not been evaluated for suitability as blue OLED-emissive
materials. Furthermore, 2,4,6-TPP is a novel compound that has not
been described in literature. This compound exhibits the most favorable
characteristics for blue OLED emission, including highest quantum
yield, thermal and photo stabilities, and the lowest degree of crystallinity,
among the pyrenylpyridines investigated. Accordingly, a nondoped,
bottom-emitting OLED prototype based on 2,4,6-TPP as the emissive
layer was fabricated. This device showed sky-blue electroluminescence
with maximum EQE of 6 (±1.2)% at 5 V. It is noteworthy that the
theoretical upper limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE) for a
typical bottom emitting OLED utilizing conventional fluorescence as
the exciton harvesting mechanism is estimated as 5%.4,6 This estimation is based on the fact that only 25% of all excitons
formed under electroluminescent conditions are formed in singlet state,
and thus are available to be harvested by conventional fluorescence.
In addition, the light outcoupling efficiency of a typical bottom
emitting OLED is approximated as only 20%.4,6 Accordingly,
the EQE value obtained for the OLED prototype described herein is
comparable to the best OLEDs based on conventional architectures with
small-molecule fluorescent emitters.

Results and Discussion
Solid-State Packing
and Thin Film Morphology
Solid-state conformation often influences
molecular aggregation and thin-film morphology, thus affecting photo-physical
properties of chromophoric compounds, particularly in the condensed
state. Therefore, molecular conformations of the pyrenylpyridines
were elucidated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and single-crystal
XRD techniques and presented in Figures S1–S3 in the Supporting Information. As revealed by PXRD,
2,4,6-TPP is an amorphous material, whereas all three DPPs are crystalline
solids (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

The observed degree of crystallinity variations of pyrenylpyridines
can be correlated to the conformational changes in these compounds.
For example, much bulkier 2,4,6-TPP may reduce the packing efficiency
in the solid-state than symmetric 2,6-DPP and 3,5-DPP and asymmetric,
but less bulkier 2,4-DPP. With the exception of 2,4,6-TPP, all pyrenylpyridines
formed high-quality single crystals suitable for single-crystal XRD
structure determination. Crystal structures of three DPP compounds
are available in crystallographic information file formats, CCDC 1560016
(2,4-DPP), CCDC 1560018 (2,6-DPP), and CCDC 1560019 (3,5-DPP). Intermolecular
distances and torsion angles of the DPPs derived from single-crystal
XRD experiments are listed in Table 1. According to single-crystal XRD data, all three DPP
compounds adopt significantly twisted conformations in the solid-state,
with torsion angles between pyrenyl and pyridine moieties ranging
from 42 (12)° to 47 (18)°, suggesting that intramolecular
twisting is significant and occurs more or less to the same extent
in all DPPs. Computed torsion angle values for DPPs were very close
to the experimental values as shown in Table 1. The computed average torsion angle in 2,4,6-TPP
was 49.58 (7)°, confirming a twisted geometry similar to the
DPPs. However, the addition of a third pyrenyl moiety in 2,4,6-TPP
had virtually no effect on the extent of intramolecular twisting of
the pyrene moieties, since positioning of three pyrene units around
the pyridine moiety in 2,4,6-TPP provided comparable steric effects
to intermolecular pyrene units as in DPPs. Despite this significant
intramolecular twisting of pyrenyl units, the DPPs managed to arrange
in an apparent zig-zag order (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), allowing the pyrenyl moieties to
undergo significant π–π stacking. The intermolecular
distances measured using C–C distances and N–N distances
of neighboring DPP molecules in crystals ranged from 6.86 (±3)
to 3.63 (±5) Å (for C–C) and 6.86 (±3) to 3.86
(±7) Å (for N–N), as a result of differences in solid-state
packing induced by the combination of factors such as the extent of
intramolecular twisting, inter- and intramolecular interactions, and
molecular symmetry. Based on intermolecular distances, solid-state
packing efficiencies of DPPs increased in the following order: 2,4-DPP
<
2,6-DPP < 3,5-DPP.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
(GIWAXS) is a useful technique to study the morphology and structural
features in organic thin films and provides more realistic morphological
information in thin films than PXRD and single-crystal XRD techniques.36 Accordingly, GIWAXS studies on vacuum-deposited
thin films of 2,4,6-TPP revealed that there were no distinct diffraction
features arising from crystalline condensed matter (Figure 1), as noted by the appearance
of an amorphous broad scattering at q = 1.51 Å.
This pattern indicated that 2,4,6-TPP thin films were essentially
amorphous, with no preferred crystalline packing of TPP molecules.
Amorphous properties are particularly suitable for materials to be
used in thin film electroluminescent devices because crystallinity
may undesirably influence thermal stability, reproducibility of device
parameters, and such solid-state characteristics as conductivity and
photothermal reactivity.37

Computational Studies
Density functional
theory (DFT) computational studies were performed to confirm structural
and electrochemical characteristics of the pyrenylpyridines. All optimized
geometries showed twisted structures with torsion angles between pyrenyl
and pyridine units, within each molecule, comparable to experimental
torsion angles obtained using single-crystal XRD (Table 1). In addition, details of frontier
molecular orbitals were computationally obtained for all pyrenylpyridines.
Noticeably, HOMO of 2,4,6-TPP was distributed over two pyrenyl components
while LUMO was primarily located on the third, orthogonal pyrenyl
moiety (Figure 2).
The asymmetric 2,4-DPP also showed disjoint, spatially separated frontier
molecular orbitals (Figure S4 in Supporting Information). In contrast, symmetric molecules 2,6-DPP and 3,5-DPP displayed
more “congruent” frontier molecular orbitals distributed
over the same pyrenyl fragments (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The disjoint, spatially localized
on different pyrenyl fragments nature of the frontier molecular orbitals
of 2,4,6-TPP (and also 2,4-DP) could contribute to a more balanced
electron and hole transport in this material, which could benefit
design of electroluminescent devices. HOMO–LUMO energy gaps
obtained using computational studies were slightly higher (approximately
0.1–0.4 eV) than values obtained using low-energy onsets of
the absorption bands of compounds in UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
(Table S1 in the Supporting Information). This difference may be the result of the computational studies
being done in the gas phase, whereas experimental determinations were
performed on condensed phases of these compounds.

Thermal and Photo Stabilities of Pyrenylpyridines
Resistance to thermal degradation is crucial for longevity of OLED
devices.38,39 In this regard, thermal stabilities of pyrenylpyridines
were evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).40 The resultant TGA profiles of pyrenylpyridines
are shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, and Tonset values are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, all
compounds exhibited high thermal stabilities with Tonset values in the range of 361–471 °C. It
is noted that the Tonset values of DPPs
were distributed over a narrow range of 361–387 °C. The
significantly higher thermal stability of 2,4,6-TPP with Tonset value of 471 °C, which is 18–23% higher
than that of typical DPPs, is attributed to higher molecular weight
of this compound, with an extra pyrenyl unit resulting in increased
magnitude of combined van der Waals intermolecular interactions between
2,4,6-TPP molecules in the solid-state. As revealed using PXRD, 2,4,6-TPP
is the only amorphous material investigated, but has the highest Tonset and Tg values.

All pyrenylpyridines were high-melting solids, with melting points
(Tm) ranging from 172 to 312 °C.
Melting temperatures of pyrenylpyridines increased in the following
order: 2,4-DPP < 2,6-DPP < 3,5-DPP < 2,4,6-TPP, which paralleled
the trend in the solid-state packing efficiency. For example, 2,4-DPP
had the lowest packing efficiency (as discussed in the XRD section),
and also showed the lowest Tm (172 °C).
The glass transition temperature (Tg)
is defined as the temperature at which a hard material is transformed
to a more pliable state.41 Therefore, exceeding
the temperature of a thin organic emissive film in an OLED device
above Tg may significantly affect device
performance because temperature-induced defects caused by several
phenomena including phase separation, crystallization, dewetting and
mixing may occur above Tg.41 On the other hand, lower Tg indicates that in normal conditions, the material remains
more flexible and pliable, and less susceptible to mechanical stress
and deformation induced degradation. Therefore, Tg values for all pyrenylpyridines were determined using
differential scanning calorimetry (see Figure S6 in Supporting Information and Table 1 for Tg values
summary). It is noted that DPPs had higher Tg values (in the range of 96–106 °C) than 2,4,6-TPP
(70 °C). Thus, thermal stability of the pyrenylpyridines could
be directly correlated to factors such as molecular symmetry, solid-state
conformation, and the extent of intermolecular interactions.

Among various degradation processes of organic semiconductors that
ultimately lead to device malfunction, photodegradation is one possible
pathway.42,43 Although the exact mechanisms involved in
these light-induced reversible/irreversible oxidation processes may
vary for a given molecule and are not always fully understood, it
has been suggested that radical dark states may be involved in these
photobleaching mechanisms.43,44 Photostability of pyrenylpyridines
was evaluated using a previously reported procedure developed for
organic dyes.45,46 In a typical time-dependent kinetic
photostability experiment, the compound is intensively irradiated
using monochromatic light of the wavelength set at the absorption
maximum for a sufficient time period, while recording the photoluminescence
intensity fluctuations at the respective emission maximum of the compound.
Because of photodegradation, photolabile compounds typically show
an exponential decrease in emission intensity when intensively irradiated.46 Therefore, it is assumed that this decay of
emission intensity observed with increased irradiation time is proportional
to the extent of photobleaching. Accordingly, photostability of pyrenylpyridines
was determined using eq 1. 1  where I is the emission
intensity after intensive irradiation and I0 is the observed emission intensity before irradiation. Resultant
time-dependent photoluminescence intensity fluctuation curves of all
pyrenylpyridines are presented in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. It is noted that all pyrenylpyridines
maintained stable photoluminescence, that is there was no measurable
photobleaching upon intense irradiation under the given experimental
conditions and time period. These photobleaching curves of pyrenylpyridines
are similar to those of other photostable compounds evaluated using
time-dependent kinetic photostability experiments.47 The enhanced photostability exhibited by pyrenylpyridines
could be attributed to pyrenyl moieties that are highly resistant
to photodegradation under ambient conditions.

Spectral Properties in Solution and Solid State
UV–vis
absorption spectra of pyrenylpyridines were recorded in dilute chloroform
solution (5 μM) and in thin solid films. Thin solid films of
pyrenylpyridines were formed on quartz slides using electro-spray
deposition (1 mM in DCM, flow rate 100 μL min–1, applied voltage 2.8 V, and applied current 3 A). The absorption
spectra obtained for solution and solid films of pyrenylpyridines
are presented in Figure 3 and values of absorption maxima and full widths at half maxima (fwhm)
are summarized in Table 2.

Accordingly, all pyrenylpyridines showed three broad absorption
bands in both solution and solid state, with absorption peak maxima
(Amax) at 244 ± 1 nm (Amax3), 282 ± 2 nm (Amax2), and 353 ± 3 nm (Amax1). Solution
and solid-state absorption spectra largely resembled those of pyrene
as a result of the high pyrenyl fraction (84% for 89% for DPPs and
2,4,6-TPP by weight) of these compounds. Accordingly, absorption peaks
are assigned to S0 to S3 (Amax3), S0 to S2 (Amax2), and S0 to S1 (Amax1) electronic transitions.21,48 There
was substantial broadening of the absorption bands due to interchromophore
electronic interactions. Such interactions could happen between pyrenyl
groups in the same molecule, which was confirmed by the delocalization
of molecular orbitals found in computational studies (vide supra).
Further broadening could be attributed to intermolecular electronic
interactions in the condensed phase (solid state). Accordingly, for
solid-state absorption spectra, absorption peaks of pyrenylpyridines
were significantly broadened with average fwhm values of 77 nm (Amax1), 43 nm (Amax2), and 58 nm (Amax3) larger in solid
films than in solution (48 nm for Amax1, 24 nm for Amax2, and 19 nm for Amax3, respectively) and red-shifted (≤7
nm).

Photoluminescence spectra of all pyrenylpyridines were
recorded in dilute chloroform solutions (1 μM) and in thin solid
films prepared by electro-spray deposition as described in the previous
section. Photoluminescence spectra of pyrenylpyridines are presented
in Figure 4. Also,
emission maxima and fwhm values are summarized in Table 3. Emission spectra of all pyrenylpyridines
in dilute solution were largely resembling pyrene emission (emission
maxima in the range of 392–440 nm), albeit the single band
was substantially broadened and showed no fine vibronic structure.48 In thin solid films, the pyrenylpyridines showed
a substantially bathochromically shifted emission band (emission maximum
in the range of 463–494 nm) with significant broadening (as
denoted by the increase of fwhm values approximately by 20–30
nm). A bathochromic shift and broadening of the emission bands are
characteristic to pyrene excimer formation.12,48 The
required presence of close cofacial contacts between pyrenyl units
of the adjacent molecules was found in the single-crystal X-ray structures
of DPPs (vide supra). Because emission in the solid-state is controlled
by excitation transfer to the lowest energy chromophores (which would,
in this case, be cofacially arranged pyrene units), all pyrenylpyridines
studies in this work showed very similar solid-state emission spectra.
However, dye aggregation was not as extensive as reported in many
cases for pyrene derivatives, where both photo- and electro-luminescence
(in terms of quantum efficiencies) are significantly reduced as a
result of aggregation-induced quenching.7,49,50

Photoluminescence of pyrenylpyridines was approximately
confined to the violet-blue region of the EMS in dilute solutions
and greenish-blue region of the EMS in the solid-state. The colors
of these compounds were assigned using CIE coordinates (Table 3) and all appeared in the range
of (0.162 ± 0.003, 0.040 ± 0.016) for solutions and (0.149
± 0.018, 0.235 ± 0.090) for solid-state. Because the pyrenylpyridine
compounds incorporate both the electron donating (pyrene) and electron
accepting (pyridine) moieties in the same molecule, this potentially
could lead to the formation of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
states. Formation of ICT states could, in principle, lead to undesirable
changes in spectral characteristics including bathochromic shifts,
broadening of the spectral bands, and decreasing fluorescence quantum
efficiency. In order to check for possible formation of ICT states,
we studied solvatochromic behavior of the pyrenylpyridines. Photoluminescence
spectra of these compounds were recorded in hexane, methanol, and
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvents with polarity indices in the range
of 0–7.2 (Figure S8 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The emission band maxima of all four
compounds slightly red-shifted with increasing solvent polarity from
394 ± 2 nm (hexane) to 435 ± 10 nm (DMSO), suggesting the
possibility of some charge transfer participation in photoluminescence
spectra.

However, possible contribution of ICT states was likely
negligible as could be discerned from nearly identical absorption
and emission excitation spectra (an example of absorption, excitation,
and emission spectra of 2,4,6-TPP in chloroform solution (5 μM)
is presented in Figure 5). The absorption and emission spectra obey “the mirror image
rule”, suggesting no major geometrical changes in the excited
state.21

High photoluminescence efficiency
is an important prerequisite for good OLED emitters, but is not the
only criterion for determining electroluminescence efficiency of OLED
emitters. This is because the electroluminescence mechanism of an
emitter may be influenced by additional factors that are independent
on photoluminescence mechanism, for example, electroluminescence efficiency
is strongly affected by OLED architecture and material’s electrical
properties.49,50 Photoluminescence efficiency
of an OLED emitter is determined in terms of PLQY, defined as the
ratio of emitted photons to absorbed photons.21 For this reason, absolute quantum yields of pyrenylpyridines in
dilute chloroform solutions and in thin films were determined using
an integrating sphere attachment to a spectrofluorometer.51Table 3 summarizes the PLQY values measured for pyrenylpyridines.
As shown, 2,4,6-TPP displayed the highest quantum yield in solution
(89%) as well as in thin film (64%). The increased photoluminescence
efficiency was likely due to decreased interactions between pyrenyl
units in 2,4,6-TPP owing to its more sterically hindered geometry.
In addition, completely amorphous thin-film morphology of 2,4,6-TPP
could also contribute to the increased PLQY. The DPPs showed PLQY
values in the range of 74–79% in solution and 47–55%
in solid films. Accordingly, and despite noticeable aggregation in
the solid-state, substantial PLQY values were observed for all pyrenylpyridines.

Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed for each of the
pyrenylpyridine compounds. Table 3 and Figure S9 in the Supporting Information provide summaries of lifetime data and decay curves
for these compounds in solid-films. Fluorescence decay curves of all
four compounds showed single-exponential decays indicating a single
pathway for energy relaxation of photoluminescence from the singlet
excited state in all cases.21 The fluorescence
lifetimes of pyrenylpyridines were distributed in the range of 7.66–4.25
ns. Fluorescence lifetimes of pyrenylpyridines increased in the following
order: 2,4-DPP < 2,6-DPP < 3,5-DPP < 2,4,6-TPP, which is
opposite to the trend in the solid-state obtained from single-crystal
XRD (except for 2,4,6-TPP, which lacks single crystal XRD data due
to amorphous nature). Because the extent of inter-molecular interactions
(which is correlated to packing efficiency) plays a key role in determining
lifetimes of fluorophores,48 the trend
of lifetimes observed for DPPs can easily be explained. For example,
2,4-DPP has the lowest packing efficiency and therefore the lowest
intermolecular interactions and lowest nonradiative deexcitation.
Thus, the highest fluorescence lifetime is observed for 2,4-DPP. For
2,4,6-TPP. However, the exact reasons for the observed lowest fluorescence
lifetime are not clear. It is noted that 2,4,6-TPP has the lowest
HOMO–LUMO energy gap, which could make nonradiative deexcitation
relatively facile for 2,4,6-TPP than for DPPs and the presence of
an additional pyrenyl unit may aid in additional intermolecular interactions
that could contribute to the observed lowest lifetime.

Electronic Characteristics
Estimating HOMO
and LUMO energies and HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (Eg) of OLED emitters is crucial for designing OLED devices.52 Typically, semiconducting materials display
energy gaps in the range of 0–4 eV.52 The Eg values of all pyrenylpyridines
were experimentally determined using UV–vis absorption spectra;
in particular, λedge values indicate the minimum
energy required to promote an electron from the ground state to the
first excited state and are related to Eg (eq 3).45 Alternatively, energies of frontier molecular
orbitals and Eg could be evaluated using
cyclic voltammetry (CV). Experimental spectroscopic Eg values were in the range of 3.10–3.28 eV as shown
in Table 4. HOMO energies
of pyrenylpyridines were experimentally obtained using CV by employing eq 2.52,54 All
pyrenylpyridines displayed quasi-reversible cyclic voltammograms with
measurable oxidation peaks (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). Quasi-reversible behavior is often
displayed by redox couples when one state (oxidation or reduction)
is not stable on the time scale of the CV experiment.55 Accordingly, LUMO values were calculated using eq 3 using Eg values from UV–vis spectroscopy.45,46 In eq 2, Eox is the onset potential value of the oxidation peak
obtained from cyclic voltammograms. The energy values experimentally
determined
for frontier molecular orbitals of the pyrenylpyridines were in the
respective ranges of −5.67 to −5.76, and −2.42
to −2.60 eV (Table 4).53 2   3

Characterization of OLED Prototype Fabricated Using 2,4,6-TPP
as the Emissive Layer
OLED emitters in emissive layers (EMLs)
can be embedded into an energetically matching host matrix (doped)
or used as is, without such matrices (nondoped/self-host).3,4 Doped EMLs have distinct advantages such as reduction in aggregation-caused
quenching and the possibility to benefit from a favorable energy transfer
between host matrix and emitter, which typically improve device performance.3,4 Disadvantages associated with doping, however, include (1) phase
separation-induced degradation, (2) limited availability of energetically
matching host materials for blue emitters, and (3) complexity in device
fabrication.3,4 Considering pros and cons of doped EMLs,
for preliminary studies presented herein, a nondoped OLED prototype
was fabricated to reduce complexity of device fabrication and to understand
electroluminescent properties of a pure emitter. Because 2,4,6-TPP
displayed the most promising photophysical characteristics among the
pyrenylpyridines under study (i.e., highest PLQY in solid state, highest
thermal stability, and lowest degree of crystallinity), an OLED prototype
was fabricated using 2,4,6-TPP as the nondoped emissive layer. These
prototypes were fabricated using a vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE)
method, in accordance with state-of-the-art fabrication.29 Fluorescence microscopy imaging was used to
characterize 2,4,6-TPP films (Figure S11 in Supporting Information). The configuration of the OLED prototype was as
follows: ITO (140 nm)/NPB (35 nm)/2,4,6-TPP (35 nm)/TPBI (30 nm)/Ca
(12 nm)/Al (100 nm) as schematically shown in Figure 6A (NPB is N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine,
and TPBI is 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)benzene).
In this OLED prototype, NPB and TPBI were hole transport and electron
transport layers, respectively, and 2,4,6-TPP was used as the nondoped
emissive layer, whereas ITO was employed as the anode and Ca as the
cathode (the schematics of OLED prototype and energy diagram are shown
in Figure 6A,B). Device
performance metrics were obtained in accordance with previously reported
standard protocols.6,56 Interestingly, a sky-blue electroluminescence
was observed from this OLED prototype with a turn-on voltage of 4
V as shown in Figure 7A. The electroluminescence spectrum of this device was analogous
to the observed photoluminescence from a thin film of 2,4,6-TPP, with
peak maximum at 490 nm (Figure S12 in Supporting Information). Thus, the electroluminescence mechanism of the
2,4,6-TPP emissive layer is assumed to be based on conventional fluorescence.4 The device reached maximum EQE of 6.0 (±1.2)%
at 5 V with luminance of 36.2 (±4.7) cd m–2, power efficiency of 8.0 (±1.9) Lm W–1, and
current efficiency of 6.3 (±1.5) cd A–1. This
device showed much brighter electroluminescence upon gradual increasing
voltage, with luminance reaching 100 cd m–2 at 7.5
V. At this luminance, an EQE of 1.2 (±0.1)%, power efficiency
of 1.1 (±0.1) Lm W–1, and current efficiency
of 1.4 (±0.1) cd A–1 were measured. The overall
prototype performance is graphically presented in Figure 7B.

the architecture of this OLED device is not drawn proportionally).

plots (B) with 2,4,6-TPP as the emissive layer.

The CIE coordinates
for electroluminescence of the prototype device were (0.154, 0.297).
The CIE spectral coordinate criterion for a blue emitter in an electronic
display with RGB sub-pixel design is (y < 0.150,
(x + y) < 0.300).3 However, the National Television System Committee (NTSC)
and European Broadcast Union (EBU) require much more spectrally pure
blue emitters for RGB sub-pixel design based electronic displays,
particularly television screens, with CIE coordinates of (0.140, 0.080)
and (0.150,0.060), respectively.4 Interestingly,
light blue emitters are indispensable in non-conventional electronic
displays. For example, a sub-pixel design known as red-green-light
blue-deep blue (RGB1B2) that was invented by
Universal Display Corporation (USA) contains a light blue component
to generate colors that do not essentially require deep blue.57,58 Such novel RGB1B2 sub-pixel designs promise
advantages including significant power saving, improved device lifespan,
and minimum emission of a harmful near-UV radiation.58−60 Therefore, the sky-blue OLED
emitter described here may be successfully applied in novel pixel
designs that contain a light blue component.59,60

Conclusions
A series of
structurally similar pyrenylpyridine compounds was successfully synthesized
and spectral, physical, and electrical properties of these compounds
were thoroughly investigated. Although these pyrenylpyridines are
structurally related, aforementioned properties were found to be quite
diverse, particularly in the solid state. These differences stem from
factors such as molecular symmetry, extent of inter/intramolecular
interactions, and molecular conformations of pyrene units. All pyrenylpyridines
exhibited high thermal and photo stability, excellent PLQY values,
and electronic properties that are suitable for potential optoelectronic
applications. Among these pyrenylpyridines, 2,4,6-TPP was found to
display the highest thermal and photo stability as well as the lowest
crystallinity in thin films, as well as the highest PLQY. Therefore,
a prototype OLED device was fabricated using 2,4,6-TPP as the nondoped
emissive layer. The device showed bright sky-blue electroluminescence
and reached a luminance value of 100 cd m–2 at 7.5
V, with EQE of 1.2 (±0.1)%, power efficiency of 1.1 (±0.1)
Lm W–1, and current efficiency of 1.4 (±0.1)
cd A–1. This indicated a good balance of electron
and hole transport, and high exciton formation efficiency in 2,4,6-TPP.
Evaluation of structure–property relationships of these pyrenylpyridines
as model compounds related to pyrene aided understanding of the important
role of morphology induced inter- and intramolecular interactions,
that are known to tremendously affect the spectral and physical characteristics
of structurally similar molecules. Future directions for this research
involve fabrication and characterization of OLED prototypes for DPPs
and fabrication of more complex OLED devices to further improve the
device performance.

The compounds, 1-pyrenylboronic
acid, 2,4,6-tribromopyridine, 2,4-dibromopyridine, 2,6-dibromopyridine,
and 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)benzene
(TPBI, sublimed grade), were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industries
Co. Ltd. (Portland, OR) and 1,4-dioxane was purchased from Acros Organics
(West Chester, PA). Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), tetrabutylammonium
hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), ferrocene (Fc), and N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine
(NPB, sublimed grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO), whereas 3,5-dibromopyridine was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward
Hill, MA). Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was purchased
from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Analytical grade solvents,
chloroform (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran, hexane, acetone, isopropanol,
ethyl acetate (EA), methanol (MeOH), DMSO, acetonitrile (ACN), and
dichloromethane (DCM), were purchased from Macron (Center Valley,
PA). Aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca) were purchased from Angstrom Engineering
Inc. (99.999%, Kitchener, ON). Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass
(sheet resistance of 8–12 Ω square–1) was purchased from Delta Technologies (Loveland, Co). Column chromatography
was performed using a silica gel (Sorbent Technologies, 60 Å,
40–63 μm) slurry packed into glass columns.

Instrumentation
All UV–vis absorption
spectra of compounds were recorded using a scanning spectrophotometer
(UV–3101PC, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) and quartz cuvettes (Starna
Cells, Atascadero, CA) with path lengths of 1 cm (for solutions) or
quartz slides (for thin films, Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). Photoluminescence
spectra were acquired using a HORIBA Spex FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorometer
(model FL3-22TAU3, Jobin-Yvon, Edison, NJ), with entrance and exit
slit widths maintained at 3 or 5 nm and using quartz cuvettes (Starna
Cells, Atascadero, CA) with path lengths of 0.4 or 1 cm or quartz
slides (for thin films, Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). The same fluorometer
was used for time-dependent kinetic photostability measurements with
a 14 nm entrance slit width, as well as for the absolute PLQY experiments,
by connecting an integrating sphere to the fluorometer (HORIBA Scientific
Quanta φ accessory, model FL3-22TAU3, HORIBA Scientific, Edison,
NJ). Fluorescence lifetime experiments based on time-correlated single
photon counting were performed using a HORIBA FluoroMax plus fluorometer
with a pulsed laser DeltaDiode (375 nm, pulse width 45 ps) and a PPD-850
detector with a transit time spread of 180 ps (Horiba Scientific,
Edison, NJ). All CV experiments were performed at room temperature
using an Autolab PGSTAT 302 potentiostat (Metrohm, Riverside, FL)
with a three-electrode system, that is, a platinum disk working electrode,
a Ag/AgNO3 non-aqueous reference electrode, and a Pt wire
counter electrode (CH Instruments, Austin, TX). The reference electrode
was checked against a ferrocene standard before and after each experiment
and measured potentials were reported against the Fc/Fc+ redox potential value. The scan rate was maintained at 0.1 V s–1 within the potential range of −0.5 to +3.0
V and TBAPF6 (in DCM or ACN, 0.1 M) was used as the supporting
electrolyte. Thermal stability studies were performed using a Hi Res
Modulated TGA 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments, New
Castle, DE). Typically, TGA experiments were conducted by heating
samples of pyrenylpyridines (<5 mg) under a nitrogen atmosphere
from 25 to 600 °C at a constant rate (10 °C min–1). Because thermal decomposition of organic compounds is typically
accompanied by formation of volatile compounds, the temperature at
which an onset of weight loss (<5%) occurs is reported as the onset
decomposition temperature of the compound (Tonset). The Tonset values are determined
using a step-tangent method derived from TA software. Single-crystal
XRD analysis was performed using a Bruker Kappa APEX-II DUO diffractometer
(Bruker, Madison, WI). Malvern PANalytical Empyrean multipurpose diffractometer
(Westborough, MA) with a copper anode was used for PXRD experiments.
Grazing incidence X-ray scattering measurements were performed at
beamline 8-ID-E of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National
Laboratory using an X-ray wavelength of 1.6868 Å.27 The area detector, a PILATUS 1M pixel array
detector (Dectris, Switzerland), was positioned 204 mm from the sample.
The sample was measured under vacuum and the scattering measured at
two different detector heights using an incident angle of 0.18°
and exposure time of 5 s. Combining corresponding images eliminated
rows of inactive pixels between detector modules and verified that
samples were not damaged by the synchrotron beam. The acquired data
(as two-dimensional images) were further treated and analyzed using
GIXSGUI software package.28

An ultra-high
VTE system (Angstrom Engineering, Kitchener, ON) was used for OLED
prototype fabrication. These OLED prototypes were fabricated in accordance
with state-of-the-art protocols.2,6,29 In summary, OLED prototypes were fabricated using the following
steps. First, ITO-coated glass was ultrasonicated sequentially in
detergent solution, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol
followed by exposure to oxygen plasma under ambient conditions for
20 min. Next, OLED prototypes were fabricated by depositing organic
layers on clean ITO coated glass substrates using the VTE system,
maintained at a base pressure less than 1 × 10–6 Torr during all depositions. Deposition rates were 0.3 Å s–1 (Ca), 1 Å s–1 (NPB, 2,4,6-TPP,
and TPBI), and 2 Å s–1 (Al). Layer thickness
calibration was achieved using a Bruker DektakXT surface profilometer
(Bruker, Madison, NJ). Electroluminescence spectra and performance
characteristics of OLED prototypes were obtained using a PTI QuantaMaster4/2006SE
spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Edison, NJ),
combined with an integrating sphere (Labsphere, North Sutton, NH).
Total spectral flux was calibrated using a SCL-050 lamp standard (Labsphere,
North Sutton, NJ). Current and voltage of OLED prototypes were controlled
and measured using a Keithley 2601 source meter (Tektronix, Inc.,
Beaverton, OR).

Computational Details
DFT computational calculations were performed using hybrid three-parameter
non-local exchange functional developed by Becke with Lee–Yang–Parr
correlation functional (B3LYP) to obtain energies and geometries of
pyrenylpyridines.30,31 The resolution of the identity
(RI) approach was employed for speeding up the computation through
effective calculation of the two-electron integrals.32 These calculations were performed using a triple-zeta valence
plus polarization basis set (such as def2-TZVP).33 Vibrational frequencies confirmed identity of optimized
structures at local minima and results were obtained by employing
the Turbomole program suite (version 4.2).34

Synthesis of Pyrenylpyridines
The four pyrenylpyridine compounds displayed in Figure 8, that is, 2,4-DPP, 2,6-DPP,
3,5-DPP, and 2,4,6-TPP, were synthesized using a one-step Suzuki coupling
reaction between respective bromopyridines and 1-pyrenylboronic acid.35 Synthesis of 2,4,6-TPP is described here as
a representative protocol that is applied to the synthesis of all
pyrenylpyridines with slight modifications. An Airfree flask was charged
with 2,4,6-tribromopyridine (126 mg, 0.40 mmol), 1-pyrenylboronic
acid (320 mg, 1.30 mmol), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)
catalyst (60 mg, 0.05 mmol) inside a glove box. Afterward, 1,4-dioxane
(60 mL, degassed for 30 min) and aqueous K2CO3 (0.2 M, 15 mL, degassed for 30 min) were added to the flask while
purging with argon. The resulting mixture was stirred at 80 °C
for 72 h under an argon atmosphere in the sealed flask, followed by
chloroform extraction. The combined organic layers were washed several
times with brine solution and DI water, and then dried using anhydrous
magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the crude
product was purified using flash column chromatography on silica gel
(eluent hexanes/EA ratio of 9:1 v/v) three times. After solvent evaporation,
2,4,6-TPP was obtained as a light-yellow powder (198 ± 16 mg,
yield 73 ± 6%). Further details on DPP synthesis are provided
in Supporting Information along with characterization
data using 13C NMR, 1H NMR, (Bruker AVANCE 400),
and ESI-MS (Agilent 6210 ESI-TOF).
