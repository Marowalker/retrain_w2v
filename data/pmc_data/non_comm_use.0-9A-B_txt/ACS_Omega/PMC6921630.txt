A mild and sustainable synthetic route was followed for
the generation
of biomolecule-assisted Ru nanocatalyst under open as well as inert
atmosphere using the polyphenol morin. The nanocatalyst was characterized
thoroughly by powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption–desorption,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.
The nanocatalyst reveals excellent catalytic activity for the reduction
of several substituted nitrobenzene to aniline derivatives under simple,
mild, and environment-friendly conditions. The catalyst can be reused
for four consecutive cycles without significant loss in its catalytic
activity.

Introduction
Study related to nanocatalysts (NCs) is
one of the most attractive
and frontline areas of modern research due to their diverse applications
in innumerable branches of science. The unique properties of NCs,
including large surface-to-volume ratio and numerous accessible active
sites compared to their bulk counterparts, make these materials most
favorable for organic transformations. Organic transformations using
NCs are in vogue as they offer several benefits like excellent atom
economy, placid reaction conditions, ease of separation of the synthesized
products as well as catalysts, etc.1−3 Therefore, extensive
research for efficient design and sustainable production of highly
active metal or metal oxide NCs is exceedingly worthwhile. Several
literature reports are available describing novel methods for the
synthesis of metal-based NCs.4−8 Nanodimensional noble metals, mainly palladium, platinum, and ruthenium
have captured significant interest, due to their high activity and
selectivity toward several catalytic processes,9,10 including
selective hydrogenation of chloro nitrobenzene (p-CNB).11 Although ruthenium is a low-cost
material, a recyclable Ru-based catalyst would make the methodology
many-fold cost-effective, environment-friendly, and industrially efficient.
The widely studied methods for the generation of nanodimensional Ru
catalyst utilize the conventional reduction process with drastic reaction
conditions.11,12

Reduction using biomolecules
has gradually captured the limelight
of researchers due to the increasing environmental, economic, as well
as industrial concern. In this connection, plant extract or plant-mediated
materials have revealed their capability to convert metal ions into
their nanostate often through a simple process without requirement
of any rigorous experimental setup. Significantly, phytochemicals
like polyphenols, phenolic acids, alkaloids, terpenoids, sugars, etc.,
present in plant metabolites, probably partake in the biosynthesis
of metal and/or metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In an effort to harness
such nanodimensional Ru, Kannan and Sundrarajan have reported the
synthesis of ruthenium oxide NPs using Acalypha indica plant extract,13 wherein they studied
the antimicrobial activity of the NPs. Ismail et al. have reported
a green synthesis of ruthenium oxide NPs using aqueous extract of Aspalathus linearis and deposited over nickel foam
to develop a supercapacitor.14 Synthesis
of Se/Ru alloy was reported by Zhou et al., with the help of gallic
acid as both reducing and stabilizing agent,15 which was further studied for the possibility of its biomedical
applications. Reports on green syntheses of nanodimensional ruthenium
for catalytic applications are scarce excepting a few.16,17 Generation of nanodimensional Ru employing the vast family of biomolecules
still remains to be unveiled and explored for their magnificent catalytic
properties. Some literature reports are tabulated here, which describe
the syntheses of Ru-NCs under different conditions (Table 1).

Formation of aniline derivatives is of significant
interest due
to the pharmaceutical as well as industrial concerns.20,21 Aniline and its derivatives widely participate in the synthesis
of several valuable compounds, including pharmaceuticals, pigments,
pesticides, herbicides, rigid polyurethane, etc.20−23 Aniline acts as the building
block for the synthesis of different peptides, amino acids, etc.24 Moreover, synthesis of aniline derivatives is
crucial due to its manifold applications in various fields such as
production of consumer goods, adhesives/sealants, coatings, textile
materials, pulp and care, rubber products, electronic goods, etc.25 Aromatic amines are usually prepared from catalytic
reduction of nitroarenes in the presence of H2 gas, NaBH4, and N2H4 as reducing agent together
with a catalyst, viz., ruthenium, SBA-15, carbon nanotubes, etc.26−36

In the present study, we have described an efficient green
synthesis
of ruthenium nanocatalysts using a flavonoid-type biomolecule, morin
as stabilizing agent at room temperature (Scheme 1). The synthesis has been done both in open
atmosphere and in N2 environment. Morin is a naturally
available polyphenol commonly obtained from Maclura
pomifera and Maclura tinctoria and from the leaves of Psidium guajava.(37) It can act as a reducing as well as
stabilizing agent during nanosynthesis. Thereafter, the as-synthesized
nanomaterials have been employed for the reduction of nitroarenes
to furnish aromatic amines and their derivatives with good to excellent
product yields.

Using Ruthenium-NCs
Characterization
Absorption Spectroscopy
Absorption spectroscopy was
used to find the best condition for the preparation of NCs. The time
scan data established the possible mechanism behind the formation
of the NCs. To get the best condition of NC formation, 0.2 mL of 10
mM alcoholic solution of morin was taken in 2.5 mL solution of different
pH values (viz., 5, 7, 9, and 12). The alcoholic solution of morin
has its characteristic absorption maximum at ∼330 nm. Then,
0.01 mL portion of 1 mM RuCl3 solution was gradually added
to the above morin-containing solution of different pH values.

N2 Adsorption–Desorption and BET Analysis
N2 adsorption–desorption was performed using
the solid sample to determine the specific surface properties of the
material. The specific surface area, pore size distribution, and pore
volume of the solid material can be obtained after degassing the material
at 300 °C in a surface area analyzer instrument for 3 h. Finally,
the specific surface area of the NCs can also be obtained using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method.

TEM analysis
The TEM analysis was performed after dispersing
2 mg of the NC in 2 mL of water–alcohol (1:1) mixture and sonicating
for 1 h. Then, the dispersed solution was drop-cast on a carbon-coated
Cu grid. Before getting the TEM images of the material, the grid was
dried under an IR lamp.

FTIR Analysis
FTIR analysis was used to get an idea
about the bond vibrations of the NCs. A very small amount of the solid
material was thoroughly mixed with dry KBr using a mortar and pestle.
The sample was then pelletized using pressure around 5 ton using a
hydraulic press. The pellet was then loaded in the sample holder of
the analyzer instrument.

Powder XRD
Powder XRD was used to determine the crystalline
nature of the prepared NCs. Powder sample was taken in a rectangular
metal holder and then the arrangement was lightly pressed before the
X-ray crystallographic analysis.

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Dynamic light scattering
experiment was carried out to estimate the hydrodynamic radii of the
NCs. The sample preparation method is similar to that of the TEM experiment.
The dispersed solution obtained after sonication for 1 h was further
diluted ∼100 times to perform the experiment.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
The thermal properties
of the NC were determined using the thermogravimetric analysis technique
under N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 10 mL/min. An ∼6
mg of solid sample was taken on a platinum pan and heated to ∼439
°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min to record the change of
weight percentage with the change of temperature.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
The
elemental composition and the oxidation state of the central metal
ion were analyzed using this technique. A monochromated Al Kα
was used as X-ray source with X-ray spot size of 900 × 900 μm2 outfitted with the XPS instrument. A flood gun was used for
uniform charge neutralization. The binding energies (BEs) of Ru 3d
(∼280 eV), C 1s (∼285 eV), N 1s (∼400 eV), and
O 1s (∼531 eV) were obtained using both full survey and narrow
scan methods. The full survey scan was repeated five times with step
size of 1 eV, pass energy of 150 eV, and dwell time of 50 ms, whereas
the narrow scan was repeated 15 times with step size and pass energy
of 0.1 and 20 eV, respectively, and dwell time of 100 ms. Due to the
very close binding energy of Ru 3d and C 1s, Ru 3p (BE ∼475
eV) was also acquired using the narrow scan method. All of the data
were examined using Thermo Avantage Software (version 5.952) taking
a smart background.

ICP-OES Analysis
Inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to determine the amount of
ruthenium in the catalyst and also the leaching percentage of the
Ru from the catalyst after the reaction. To get the amount of ruthenium
in the catalyst, 6 mg of solid catalyst was digested in hot and concentrated
HNO3. To achieve leaching of the catalyst, 6 mg of the
catalyst was treated with nitrobenzene, water, and reducing agent
as in the reaction mixture (as described in the following section).
After the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was centrifuged.
The reaction mixture was collected separately, and the solid catalyst
was again washed with water and then centrifuged again. Finally, the
reaction mixture was digested with hot and concentrated HNO3. After three successive addition and evaporation of concentrated
acid, the solid masses so obtained were cooled to room temperature.
Finally, the solid masses were treated with a requisite amount of
Milli-Q water. Then, the aqueous solutions were filtered using a microsyringe
filter (pore size, 0.22 μm). The filtrates were then diluted
with water to a particular volume, and then the solutions were introduced
in the ICP-OES instrument.

Catalytic Activity for Reduction of Nitrobenzene to Aniline
The NCs designated as Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 were
studied for their catalytic activities toward reduction of nitrobenzene
to aniline in the presence of NaBH4 as a reducing agent
and water as a solvent at 100 °C. After completion of the reaction
(as indicated by TLC), and separation of the catalyst, the reaction
mixture was extracted using ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The organic
part was washed with water and dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate.
Then, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to get the
solid mass that was purified by column chromatography using pet ether
and ethyl acetate as eluent to get the pure product. The identity
of the product was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopy.

Recycling Experiment
At the end of the reaction, Ru-morin@N2 NC was separated from the reaction medium by centrifugation.
Particularly, Ru-morin@N2 NC was chosen for the recycling
experiment as it showed better catalytic activity. The collected NC
was repetitively rinsed with water and ethyl acetate, followed by
diethyl ether. Finally, the NC was dried at 80 °C temperature
for 1 h to activate for the next run.

Results and Discussion
Absorption Spectroscopy
The best condition for the
formation of the NC was pH 12, as indicated by the absorption spectra.
At this pH, a sharp increase in the absorbance (λmax = 330 nm) occurred with gradual addition of RuCl3 solution
to the morin solution of pH 12. The Benesi–Hildebrand (B–H)
(Figure 1 and inset)
plot indicates that the stoichiometry and the association constant
for the interaction between ruthenium and morin at pH 12 were 1:1
and 1235.83 M–1, respectively, using eq 1 1  where A0 is the
absorbance of morin solution in the absence of ruthenium, A1 is the absorbance of morin solution when it
is completely bound with ruthenium, A is the absorbance
of morin solution with gradual addition of ruthenium, [M] is the concentration
of ruthenium, and Ka is the binding or
association constant.38

B–H plot (inset) between morin (79–76
μM) and ruthenium (4–30 μM) at pH 12.

The absorption spectral changes of morin solution
at pH values
5, 7, and 9 with increasing Ru concentration were insignificant and
are pictorially described in supplementary figures (Figures S1–S3).

Mechanism of Formation of NCs
The possible mechanism
for the formation of NC was established using time-dependent absorption
spectroscopy. To study the mechanism, the metal solution and alcoholic
solution of morin were taken in equimolar ratio at pH 12 in a cuvette
and then the absorbance value of the resulting solution was measured
at 330 nm continuously up to 4.5 h (Figure 2). The initial hike followed by achieving
a maximum suggested an increase in monomer concentration which resulted
due to burst nucleation governed by the LaMer mechanism. Thereafter,
a steady increase in the absorbance for ruthenium-morin NC proposed
a rapid autocatalytic growth according to the Finke–Watzky
model.39

material at pH 12.

N2 Adsorption–Desorption and BET Analysis
The catalytic activity of porous materials may be related to their
surface activity, which is again dependent on their pore diameter.
This can be found in agreement with earlier studies.40,41 The catalyst in this was also found to be mesoporous as can be seen
from the results of BET analysis. Figure 3 represents the N2 adsorption–desorption
curve of the Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 NCs. From the
figure, it is clear that the surface properties of Ru-morin@air show
a convex type of isotherm with a blunt knee at a lower P/P0 value and an elevated adsorption
at higher P/P0 value.
This type of isotherm (type II) is generally obtained for unhampered
monolayer–multilayer adsorption at high P/P0. The small knee indicates a major overlap
of monolayer adsorption and initiation of multilayer adsorption. The
width of the adsorption layer increased at P/P0 = 1. An H3 hysteresis loop was obtained for
Ru-morin@air which is typical for nonrigid platelike assembly at the
surface of the NCs. The adsorption–desorption study for Ru-morin@N2 shows type IV isotherm with H4 hysteresis loop. This type
of isotherm is common for mesoporous adsorbent in which the adsorbent–adsorptive
interaction plays a key role in determining the adsorption behavior
of the adsorbent. Similar to type II isotherm, the monolayer–multilayer
adsorption takes place by the pore condensation phenomenon. The H4
hysteresis loop has the characteristics of aggregated particles as
obtained from TEM study also (discussed in the following section).42 For Ru-morin@N2, the change of the
nature of the isotherm and the hysteresis loop is also in agreement
with the change of surface morphology in inert atmosphere.43 The BET specific surface areas of Ru-morin@air
and Ru-morin@N2 NCs are 4.72 and 24.11 m2/g,
respectively. The porous nature of each of the adsorbent is obtained
from this characterization and shows the average pore diameter for
Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 to be 8.33 and 7.82 nm, respectively.

Figure 3 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of Ru-morin@air
and Ru-morin@N2NCs.

TEM Analysis
Figure 4 represents the TEM images of the prepared NCs, Ru-morin@air,
and Ru-morin@N2 and confirms that they are formed in nanodimensions.
The TEM images indicate significant differences for Ru-morin@air and
Ru-morin@N2. For Ru-morin@air, frail lattice fringes with
nanocrystalline and fine porosity were observed. However, for Ru-morin@N2, the TEM image shows an aggregated mass of the NCs with hardly
any nanocrystallinity. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern (Figure 5)
of the NCs reflected the same observation as from the TEM images.
The particle size of the NCs was estimated using histogram analysis.
From the histogram data, we obtained that the average particle size
of Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 lies in the range of 20–10
nm (Figure 6). There
is a slight decrease in average particle size in N2 atmosphere.
However, there is an enhanced tendency for agglomeration in inert
atmosphere, which arises due to higher interparticle interactions
in the inert atmosphere.43,44 These results are in
good agreement with the literature reports that suggest the change
of surface morphology with the implementation of inert atmosphere.

Figure 6 Histogram of Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 NCs.

FTIR Analysis
To get information about the bond vibrations
of the NCs, the solid-state FTIR spectroscopy was performed. We tried
to compare the bond frequencies present in the NC to that of the pure
morin molecule to get a clear idea about the change, appearance, or
disappearance of bond vibrations. Figure 7 represents the FTIR spectra of pure morin,
Ru-morin@air, and Ru-morin@N2 NCs. On inspection of the
three spectra, we found that, on NC formation, a clear change is observed
in the 1612–831 cm–1 region. For Ru-morin@air,
the peak at 1612 cm–1 for C=C stretching
vibration present in morin was shifted to 1619 cm–1. The two peaks at 1515 and 1445 cm–1 for aromatic
C=C stretching and in-plane C–C–H bending present
in morin moiety completely disappeared in Ru-morin@air. The peak at
1376 cm–1 for −OH bending vibration and in-plane
bending vibration of the C–O–H group present in morin
molecule was shifted to 1383 cm–1 in Ru-morin@air.
Two peaks of morin at 1294 and 1163 cm–1 for asymmetric
stretching of Ph–O bond and aromatic C–H bending, respectively,
absolutely disappeared in Ru-morin@air. Rather a new peak at 1121
cm–1 for in-plane C–H bending vibration appeared
upon NC formation in open atmosphere (Ru-morin@air). Another new peak
at 1867 cm–1 appeared due to metal–CO bond
vibration in Ru-morin@air NC. The peak at 831 cm–1 for twisting vibration of the C–O bond was absent in the
NC materials. For Ru-morin@N2, although the change in bond
frequency is less prominent than that for Ru-morin@air, yet we tried
to elaborate the situation. The peak at 1612 cm–1 in morin was shifted to 1625 cm–1 in the Ru-morin@N2 NCs. The peak at 1515 cm–1 in the morin
moiety remained unaltered on NC formation, whereas the intensity of
the peak at 1445 cm–1 was measurably lowered and
a new peak at 1417 cm–1 appeared in the NC. The
peak at 1294 cm–1 in morin was missing in the NC,
rather a new peak at 1237 cm–1 appeared due to bending
vibration of CH2 group in the NC. The peak at 1376 cm–1 disappeared and a new peak at 1321 cm–1 appeared owing to = C–H bending vibration in the NC. The
peak at 1163 cm–1 in the morin was shifted to 1182
cm–1 upon NC formation. Another new peak at 989
cm–1 due to C–H bond vibration appeared in
the Ru-morin@N2 NC. The peak at 831 cm–1 in morin was shifted to 836 cm–1 in the Ru-morin@N2 NC material. One new peak at 1805 cm–1 appeared
in this NC owing to the metal–CO bond vibration. The results
with individual band identifications are presented in Table 2. The FTIR data suggest that
although there is bonding between functionalities of morin and metal,
no subsequent oxidation of morin could be observed, suggesting that
morin is acting as a stabilizing agent.

morin, Ru-morin@air, and Ru-morin@N2 NCs.

Powder XRD
Figure S4 represents
the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 NCs. No major diffraction pattern in the PXRD of either of
the two materials was observed. Although the TEM image and SAED pattern
of Ru-morin@air indicate the nanocrystalline nature of the material,
the PXRD pattern grossly reflects its amorphous nature. This can be
attributed to the experimental setup of the two characterization tools.
For TEM or SAED, we generally focus on a very particular portion of
the NC in its microenvironment. But for PXRD, the result is basically
the average behavior of a larger portion of the material. For Ru-morin@N2, both the results are in agreement with each other and indicate
the amorphous nature of the material.

DLS Measurement
From DLS analysis, the hydrodynamic
radii of Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 NCs were obtained
as 614 and 46 nm, respectively (Figure 8). The anomalies in the particle size compared to the
TEM experiment are due to the enhanced hydrodynamic radius of the
NCs in solution phase present in the colloidal solution.53 The larger increase in the hydrodynamic radius
for Ru-morin@air compared to Ru-morin@N2 may be attributed
to the involvement of oxygen in the atmosphere that results in the
generation of oxide-type particles with a resultant increase in the
hydration environment. This trend in deviation is in good agreement
with the results obtained from TEM experiment.

Figure 8 DLS pattern of Ru-morin@air
and Ru-morin@N2 NCs.

TGA Analysis
Figure 9 describes the TGA graph of the Ru-morin@N2 NC. The plot shows a gradual weight loss of the NC with the increase
of temperature. But it is only 14% from the ambient temperature to
100 °C, which may be due to the presence of polyphenol moiety,
which degrades upon heating. Although a significant mass loss was
observed after 200 °C, as our reaction is carried out at ∼100
°C, we can say that up to this temperature, the catalyst is stable
enough and is able to catalyze the reaction successfully.

Figure 9 TGA graph for
Ru-morin@N2 NC.

XPS Data
The narrow scan XPS images of Ru 3d and C
1s of the two NCs are plotted in Figure 10. In spite of very close proximity of Ru
3d and C 1s binding energy, Ru 3d5/2 remains outside from
that of the C 1s region and hence both of them can be analyzed simultaneously
in the presence of one another. From the figure, it is clear that
in both of the NCs, ruthenium is present in the form of RuCl3 and RuO3 although the atomic percentages are different.
The table associated with Figure 10 reflects the atomic percentages of RuCl3 and RuO3 present in the two NCs. The lower atomic percentage
of RuO3 for Ru-morin@N2 NC is quite obvious
as the material is prepared in inert atmosphere. The participation
of morin toward the formation of NCs was also varied upon change in
the preparation environment. This was confirmed from the variation
of atomic percentage of sp3 carbon, sp2 carbon,
C=O, −O–C=O, and C–O–C carbons,
as reflected in the table of Figure 10.

Figure 10 XPS images of Ru-morin@air and Ru-morin@N2 NCs.

ICP-OES Analysis
From the ICP-OES technique, the amount
of ruthenium in the catalyst was found to be 1.97 × 10–3 mol %. After the first run, the catalyst was regenerated from the
reaction mixture, which was further analyzed for the amount of Ru
that could have been leached from the catalyst during the reaction.
It was found that only 1.28% of Ru has leached from the catalyst after
the first cycle. Therefore, there was a fair possibility of recyclability
of the catalyst, which was further confirmed by actually recycling
it four times. The experiment is described below.

Catalytic Activity of the Ru-Based NCs
After the synthesis
and thorough characterization, the reactivity of the NC was examined
for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes to furnish aniline derivatives.
We commenced our study by performing a series of experiments to screen
the catalysts using nitrobenzene (1a) as the model substrate
and sodium borohydride as the reducing agent (Table 3). During our preliminary experiments for
the screening of the catalysts, Ru-morin NC formed under nitrogen
atmosphere (Ru-morin@N2) produced better product yields
than Ru-morin@air (entries 1 and 2, Table 3). This is due to the fact that the NC entitled
as Ru-morin@N2 has a smaller particle size as well as a
larger surface area (24.11 m2/g) than Ru-morin@air, which
help to speed up the reaction rate through the binding of increasingly
more reactant molecules over the surface of the NC. Besides, it was
interesting to find that the newly synthesized NC (Ru-morin@N2) is to some extent more reactive than the homogeneous RuCl3 catalyst (entry 3, Table 3). Moreover, reduction reaction using only 6 mg of
pristine morin as the active catalyst gave back the substrate 1a after 3 h (entry 4, Table 3). This signifies the inactive nature of morin in this
reaction.

After screening of the catalyst, Ru-morin@N2 NC was
employed to optimize the reaction conditions (Table 4). The reaction did not take place without
any catalyst that ensures the principal role of the ruthenium NC in
this reduction reaction (entry 1, Table 4). Several solvents, including ethanol, water–ethanol
mixture (1:1), toluene, DMF, water, etc. (entries 2–6, Table 4), were screened,
but except water, rest of them showed a detrimental effect on the
product yield. The reactions were found to proceed satisfactorily
under refluxing conditions (entries 6–8, Table 4). Besides, 6 mg of Ru-morin@N2 NC (1.97 × 10–3 mol % of Ru) was found the
best for this reduction reaction (entries 6, 11–12, Table 4).

Similar to that of the catalyst, reducing agent is
also another
important parameter for this reaction. The reaction did not furnish
any product without any reducing agent (entry 1, Table 5). Several types of reducing
agents were examined for this reaction (Table 5). Among them, SnCl2, d-glucose, d-galactose, ascorbic acid, formic acid, and disodium
tartrate remained unsuccessful to furnish any desired products (entries
2–7, Table 5). It was found that hydrazine monohydrate produced only around 60%
yield, while sodium borohydride gives 91% yield under the same condition
(entries 8 and 9, Table 5). The amount of NaBH4 was also screened (entries 9–11, Table 5), and the best result
was obtained in the presence of 0.5 mmol NaBH4 using 6
mg of Ru-morin@N2 (1.97 × 10–3 mol
% of Ru) in water as the green solvent after 1.5 h of stirring under
refluxing conditions.

After the attainment of the best reaction conditions,
scope and
efficiency of this methodology were further extended for the reduction
of several substituted nitrobenzenes. Except aniline products, no
side products were formed during the course of this reduction reaction,
which undoubtably signifies the selectivity of our newly synthesized
methodology. The results are given in Table 6. Substrates having the phenyl ring substituted
by electron-donating groups as well as electron-withdrawing groups
bestowed good to best product yields using our optimized reaction
conditions. Reduction of 1-methyl-3-nitrobenzene and 1-methoxy-2-nitrobenzene
produced their corresponding amino products with 93 and 91% yields
(entries 2 and 3, Table 6). The nitro group of 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene was successfully reduced
to furnish the amino product 3-bromoaniline with 89% yield (entry
4, Table 6). Our optimized
reaction condition was found to be very selective toward the nitro
group, keeping the −CN group unaffected in the case of 4-nitrobenzonitrile
(entry 5, Table 6).

Recyclability
Capability of recycle and reuse are the
principal advantages of
a heterogeneous catalyst. To examine the recycling efficiency of the
NCs, reduction reaction was performed using nitrobenzene as the model
substrate. The recyclability chart of the NCs is presented in Figure 11. Further, the
stability of the reused catalyst was examined by FTIR analysis (Figure 12) (Table 7), and from this spectrum and
the table, it is quite clear that the newly synthesized Ru-morin@N2 NC is significantly stable up to four cycles without a considerable
loss in its activity.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a newly designed ruthenium-based
nanocatalyst has
been synthesized through a mild and eco-friendly methodology under
inert atmosphere. Interestingly, the nanocatalyst provides excellent
catalytic activity for the synthesis of several substituted anilines
using water as green solvent. Our newly generated methodology showcases
a number of advantages: (a) significantly lower time of reaction;
(b) use of water as green solvent; (c) scope of wide functionalization;
(d) small particle size of the NC; (e) ease of catalyst as well as
product separation; (f) excellent turnover frequency; and (g) hassle-free
technique for the synthesis of the NC. We have summarized a comparison
of our work with the previously reported reduction methodologies of
similar aromatic nitro compounds using Ru-based catalyst in Table 8. The all round advantage
of water-based catalyst generation and reaction conditions together
with a wide suitable ratio of reducing agent to starting material,
product yield, and catalyst reusability make the method fairly attractive.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O, MW: 207.43), morin
hydrate [(2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxychromen-4-one)],
nitrobenzene (≥99.0%), and CDCl3 were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents required for this study were of
AR grade and used as obtained. All of the solvents used were distilled
and dried before the actual use. Triple-distilled water was used throughout
the experiment.

Apparatus
Absorption spectral data were acquired using
PerkinElmer Lambda 25 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were analyzed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) using
a Quantachrome surface area analyzer. The specific surface area and
pore diameter were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained
using a Jeol JEM 2100 HR with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded
in the range 400–4000 cm–1 on a PerkinElmer
FT-IR 783 spectrophotometer having a resolution of 1 cm–1 and PerkinElmer FT-IR Spectrum Two Spectrophotometer having a resolution
of 0.5 cm–1 using KBr pellets. A Mettler Toledo
digital balance correct up to fourth decimal place was used for measuring
the weights. A centrifuge machine Remi Elektrotechnik Ltd. R-4C was
used to separate the supernatant solution of the nanoparticle. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) was measured using X-PERT-PRO Panalytical diffractometer
to confirm the actual phase of the prepared material. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out using a Thermo Scientific
Escalab 250 Xi system. The hydrodynamic radii of the NCs were estimated
using Malvern Zetasizer Nano S, model ZEN 1600 dynamic light scattering
(DLS) instrument. The thermogravimetric analysis of the NCs was conducted
using Diamond TG/DTA Thermogravimetric/Differential Thermal Analyzer
of PerkinElmer Instruments in the temperature range of 28–439
°C. A digital Mettler Toledo Seven Compact pH/ion meter was used
to measure and adjust the pH of the solutions. The mol % of ruthenium
present in the NCs was estimated using ICP-OES instrument (ICAP duo
6500, Thermo Fisher Scientific; RF power, 1150 W; flush pump rate,
50 rpm; analysis pump rate, 50 rpm; auxiliary gas flow, 1.0 L/min,
Nebulizer gas flow, 0.60 L/min; coolant gas flow, 12 L/min; and wavelength,
287.876 nm). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis was performed
on TLC silica gel 60 F254. The products were purified using
silica gel (60–120 mesh) column chromatography. NMR spectra
were recorded on a 300 and 400 MHz NMR instrument using CDCl3 as solvents. The 1H chemical shifts are reported in ppm
relative to TMS.

Synthesis of Ruthenium NCs at Open Atmosphere (Ru-morin@air)
Initially, 5 mL of 10 mM aqueous solution of RuCl3 was
prepared at ∼18 °C. Then, it was added to 5 mL of 10 mM
ethanolic solution of morin. Thereafter, the resulting solution was
kept undisturbed overnight after adjusting the pH to ∼12 using
NaOH solution. The solution was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10
min, and the supernatant solution was discarded. The residue was washed
several times with a water:EtOH (1:1) mixture until the washing was
colorless. Finally, the solid NC, designated as Ru-morin@air, was
dried and taken for characterization and application.

Synthesis of Ruthenium NCs under N2 Atmosphere (Ru-morin@N2)
The synthesis procedure of this case is similar
to that of Ru-morin@air. The only difference lies in the atmospheric
condition of synthesis. Here, preparation of all of the solutions
and the total synthesis procedure were carried out in a glovebox under
N2 atmosphere. As in the previous case, the NC was washed
several times with a water:EtOH (1:1) mixture and finally dried before
taking out of the N2 atmosphere and designated as Ru-morin@N2.
