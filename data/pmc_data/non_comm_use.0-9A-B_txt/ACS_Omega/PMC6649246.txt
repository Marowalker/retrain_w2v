Amylose forms supramolecular inclusion
complexes with polymeric
guests in the phosphorylase-catalyzed enzymatic polymerization field,
so-called “vine-twining polymerization”. However, such
inclusion complexes have not exhibited specific properties and processability
as functional supramolecular materials. In this study, we found that
amylosic inclusion complexes, which were obtained by vine-twining
polymerization using a designed guest polymer, that is, an amphiphilic
triblock copolymer poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline-block-tetrahydrofuran-block-2-methyl-2-oxazoline), exhibited
gel and film formation properties. The characterization results of
the products suggested that enzymatically elongated amylose chains
complexed with the polytetrahydrofuran block in the triblock copolymer.
Accordingly, the outer poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) blocks constructed
hydrophilic spaces among the inclusion complex segments. Furthermore,
the presence of such outer blocks affected the lower regularity of
crystalline alignment among the inclusion complex segments in the
products. Such higher-order structures probably induced the formation
of supramolecular soft materials, such as gels and films.

Introduction
Polysaccharides are one of the major classes
of biopolymers and
have been used as fundamental materials in traditional applications
such as foods, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and textile industries.1,2 Amylose is an energy polysaccharide as one component of starch and
also known as a functional polymeric material owing to its left-handed
helical conformation, composed of α(1→4)-linked glucose
(G) repeating units.3,4 Because of hydrophobicity inside
a cavity of the amylose helix, it can bind hydrophobic guest molecules
with appropriate sizes, mostly monomeric molecules by hydrophobic
interaction, to form amylosic supramolecules comprising the structure
of inclusion complexes, so-called V-amylose.5 Polymeric guest molecules with high molecular weights are promising
candidates to imply practical applications as supramolecular materials
by complexation with amylose, compared to such monomeric guests.6 However, a limited number of studies have successfully
investigated the direct complexation of amylose and polymeric guest
molecules. Because weak hydrophobic interaction is a driving force
for the incorporation of guest molecules into the amylose cavity,
amylose is considered to be not having the ability to encapsulate
long polymeric guests into its cavity. The introduction of suitable
hydrophilic groups at the polymer chain ends has implied enhancement
of the complexation in aqueous media to achieve the direct incorporation
of polymeric guests into the cavity of amylose.7,8 The
exchange from small guest molecules to large (polymeric) ones was
also attempted to obtain amylose–polymer inclusion complexes.9 The inclusion polymerization approach has been
achieved to directly form amylose–polymer inclusion complexes.10,11 Furthermore, the direct mixing approach under the selected conditions
has been conducted to form an inclusion complex from amylose and poly(tetrahydrofuran)
(PTHF).12−14

We have previously employed phosphorylase-catalyzed
enzymatic polymerization
as the dynamic field to form amylose–polymer inclusion complexes
in situ.6,15−20 This enzymatic polymerization occurs by using α-d-glucose 1-phosphate (G-1-P) as a monomer, which is initiated from
the chain end of a maltooligosaccharide primer. The propagation progresses
with the formation of an α(1→4)-glycosidic linkage, according
to the following reversible reaction: (α(1→4)-G)n + G-1-P ⇄ (α(1→4)-G)n+1 + Pi (inorganic phosphate).21−24 When guest polymers with moderate hydrophobicity are dispersed in
the aqueous enzymatic polymerization system, the propagation has been
found to progress with binding the guest polymers in the cavity, giving
rise to amylose–polymer inclusion complexes. In this system,
the sufficient dynamic field for the more efficient complexation with
polymeric guests than the direct complexation is provided during the
enzymatic elongation from the short maltooligosaccharide primer to
the longer amylose to form the inclusion complexes. The image of propagation
in this system is similar to the way that the vines of plants grow
with twining around a rod. Accordingly, we have proposed that this
polymerization method can be called “vine-twining polymerization”
for the formation of amylose–polymer inclusion complexes. For
example, a hydrophobic polyether, PTHF, acts as a guest polymer with
moderate hydrophobicity in the vine-twining polymerization, giving
rise to the efficient formation of an amylose–PTHF inclusion
complex.25,26 Regardless of the guest polymers, however,
all the inclusion complexes, obtained by the vine-twining polymerization,
have showed powdery appearances and not exhibited specific properties
and processability as functional supramolecular materials, such as
soft material formation, probably due to the regular crystalline structure
and insufficient mechanical properties of V-amylose.

To fabricate
amylosic supramolecular soft materials comprising
V-amylose segments, such as gels and films, by vine-twining polymerization,
we have employed immobilized primers (maltoheptaose, G7) or guest polymers as graft chains, which are covalently attached
on suitable polymeric main chains.27−33 With the progress of the vine-twining polymerization, amylosic inclusion
complexes are formed with the graft chains among the main-chain polymers,
which act as cross-linking points to construct supramolecular network
structures, resulting in the formation of soft materials.

In
the present study, we have attempted to fabricate amylosic supramolecular
soft materials from the vine-twining polymerization products by using
appropriately designed guest polymers, besides the abovementioned
immobilization approach. Consequently, we found that vine-twining
polymerization using an amphiphilic triblock copolymer composed of
an inner hydrophobic PTHF block and outer hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)
(PMeOx) blocks (P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx)) provided the gel and film formation abilities in the resulting
inclusion complexes (Figure 1). The characterization results suggested that the outer PMeOx
chains constructed hydrophilic spaces among inclusion complex (V-amylose)
segments with the inner PTHF chain and also contributed to lowering
the regularity of crystalline alignment among the V-amylose segments,
leading to new higher-order structures, suitable for the formation
of supramolecular soft materials.

Results and Discussion
The guest
triblock copolymers, (P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx)s), with different compositional ratios were
synthesized by ring-opening block copolymerization of THF with MeOx
initiated by trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf2O),
according to a literature procedure.34 After
acetylation of the terminal hydroxy groups were conducted using acetic
anhydride in pyridine, the Mn values of
the triblock copolymers and the degrees of polymerization (DP) values
of the PTHF and PMeOx blocks were estimated by integrated ratios of
the methylene signals (−C–CH2CH2–C−) of PTHF blocks and the methyl signals of PMeOx
blocks to the methylene signals of the terminal acetate groups (−CH2O(C=O)CH3) in the 1H NMR spectra
of the products in CD3OD. Three samples composed of similar
PTHF block lengths with different PMeOx block lengths were prepared
by adapting the reaction conditions to evaluate the effect of hydrophilicity
on the properties of the vine-twining polymerization products (runs
2–4, Table 1). As the guest polymer for a contrast experiment, a homopolymer
(PTHF) was also prepared by ring-opening polymerization of THF initiated
by ethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (EtOTf) (run 1, Table 1).35

Vine-twining polymerization using
P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx)s as
the guest polymers was then
carried out by phosphorylase-catalyzed enzymatic polymerization of
G-1-P (5 equiv with the guest polymer) with G7 (1/100 equiv
with G-1-P) in 0.2 mol/L sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.2) under dispersion
of the guest polymers (Figure 1). After the mixtures were maintained at 40 °C for 24
h with stirring, the precipitates were filtered and washed with water
and methanol to obtain the products.

The products thus obtained
by vine-twining polymerization using
the three triblock copolymers were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and 1H NMR measurements, the results of which were
further compared with those of an amylose–PTHF inclusion complex
produced by the same experimental manner using PTHF as the guest polymer.
The XRD profiles of all of the products from the triblock copolymers
show two typical diffraction peaks at around 13 and 20° corresponding
to the distance between the helix centers (corresponding to approximately
a diameter) and the helical pitch in the inclusion complex (Figure 2c–e),36 which are identical to the pattern of the inclusion
complex from PTHF (Figure 2b) and from other slender guest polymers regardless of the
DPs of amyloses as shown in previous studies25,26,37 but completely different from that of pure
amylose (Figure 2a).
These XRD profiles suggested that the inclusion complexes were formed
in the present system using the amphiphilic triblock copolymers. Furthermore,
the results also indicated the inclusion toward the PTHF blocks by
amylose with exclusion of complexation with the PMeOx blocks in the
triblock copolymers, owing to the former hydrophobicity and the latter
hydrophilicity.

Figure 2 XRD profiles of (a) amylose, (b–e) vine-twining
polymerization
products of runs 1–4, and (f–i) casted materials from
solutions of products of runs 1–4 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

The 1H NMR results
of the products from the triblock
copolymers in DMSO-d6 also support the
formation of the inclusion complexes because of the detection of both
the signals assigned to amylose and the PTHF and PMeOx protons as
shown in Figure 3.
The inclusion ratios of the amylose cavities to the THF blocks were
evaluated by the integrated ratio of the H1 (anomeric)
signals of the G residues to the methylene signals a (−C–CH2CH2–C−) of PTHF blocks (H1/a) in the 1H NMR spectra according to the calculation
method reported in our previous literature on vine-twining polymerization
using PTHF.26,38 Generally, one helical turn of
amylose is composed of approximately six repeating G units when linear
molecules of small cross-sectional area, such as PTHF, are included.39 A repeat distance of the amylose helix and a
unit length of PTHF have been calculated to be 0.80 and 0.60 nm, respectively.
Therefore, an average of 4.5 repeating G units in amylose corresponds
to a unit length of PTHF. From these calculations, the integrated
ratio of the above H1 signals to the methylene signals
(H1/a) in the 1H NMR spectrum is theoretically
1.13. The H1/a value in the 1H NMR spectrum
of the amylose–PTHF inclusion complex (run 1) was calculated
to be 0.9 (Figure 3a), which indicated that the amylose cavity included most (ca. 80%)
of the PTHF chain. By the same calculation, the H1/a values
in the 1H NMR spectra of the products of runs 2–4
(Figure 3b–d)
were calculated to be 0.73, 0.66, and 0.56, which in turn indicated
the inclusion of ca. 65, 58, and 49% of the PTHF chains by the amylose
cavity (Table 1). These
results suggested that the inclusion ratios of the amylose cavities
to the PTHF blocks in the triblock copolymers decreased in accordance
with the increase of hydrophilicities of the guest copolymers. This
is because the driving force for the formation of inclusion complexes
by amylose is a hydrophobic interaction, and accordingly, the longer
PMeOx blocks present at both the ends of the PTHF block inhibit the
complexation by amylose. The inclusion complexation on the PTHF blocks
probably started by hydrophobic interaction with a short amylose and
then progressed during its enzymatic chain-elongation to a longer
amylose according to the vine-twining polymerization manner as our
previous study already suggested.26 In
addition to its hydrophilicity, furthermore, bulkiness of the PMeOx
blocks is also considered to inhibit the complexation by amylose because
vine-twining polymerization has been achieved mostly using slender
quest polymers, such as PTHF without substituents on the main chain.6

polymerization

Dissociation of the inclusion
complexes was conducted by the DMSO
treatment according to our literature procedure.40 After solutions of the inclusion complexes in DMSO were
maintained at 70 °C with stirring, the amylose and the guest
polymer components were separated as fractions insoluble and soluble
in methanol, respectively. The DP (Mn)
values of the dissociated amyloses were determined from the λmax values in the UV–vis spectra of the violet solutions
of complexes with iodine,41,42 which decreased in
accordance with the increase of the PMeOx block lengths (runs 2–4)
with monomodal gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) profiles (Mw/Mn < 2.1) as
shown in Table 1. The
longer PMeOx chains probably prevented the approach by the enzyme
and thus the further enzymatic elongation of amylose chains helically
present around the PTHF block, owing to steric hindrance of the PMeOx
blocks. Similar prevention of the enzymatic elongation of amylose
was also observed in another vine-twining polymerization system using
G7-functionalized poly(l-lactide) (primer–guest
conjugate).37 On the other hand, the DP
values of the PTHF and PMeOx blocks in the dissociated guest copolymers
were estimated from the 1H NMR results after acetylation
of the terminal hydroxy groups by a similar manner to that mentioned
above. In all cases, consequently, the DP values of the former blocks
increased, whereas those of the latter blocks decreased compared with
the values of the original triblock copolymers. These results suggested
that the enzymatically elongated amylose chains preferentially included
the more hydrophobic fractions distributed in the triblock copolymers.
Indeed, the Mw/Mn values of the dissociated triblock copolymers, which were
estimated by GPC analysis, were smaller than those of the original
ones (Table 1), suggesting
the inclusion of specific fractions in the original triblock copolymers
by the amylose chains. Based on the Mn values of the amylose components and the DP values of the PTHF blocks
in the guest polymer components, the inclusion ratios were calculated
to be 62, 53, and 43% for runs 2–4, which were in good agreement
with those estimated from the abovementioned integrated ratios in
the 1H NMR spectra. According to the lengths of the amylose
helixes and PTHF blocks, estimated from their DP (Mn) values (6.3–10.5 and 15.0–17.6 nm, respectively),
it can be considered that one amylose chain includes averagely one
or possibly two guest molecules.

As one of the potential new
functions of the products, which can
be applied as functional supramolecular materials, their swellability
was investigated. Consequently, the products of runs 3 and 4 were
facilely swollen in methanol with ultrasonication, while such swellability
in methanol was not observed from the other two products (runs 1 and
2). Furthermore, when the resulting samples were immersed in water
for 24 h to exchange disperse media, the former two swollen samples
could be converted into hydrogels with water contents of 74.4 and
81.2%, respectively (Figure 4c,d), but the others remained intact as powder (Figure 4a,b). Additionally, pure P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx) did not show swellability
with methanol and water, but it was dissolved in methanol and suspended
and then agglomerated in water. The frequency dependence of storage
and loss modulus (G′ and G″, respectively) in the dynamic viscoelastic measurement of
the hydrogel of run 3 shows the signature of the typical viscoelastic
material with predominance of storage modulus in the whole frequency
range (Figure 5), supporting
the gelling state of this sample. To reveal the difference in swellabilities
of the products of runs 1–4, their crystalline structures were
evaluated by comparison of the XRD profiles of the lyophilized samples
after the treatment experiment (Figure 6). The area ratios of two peaks, i.e., peak A at 13°
to peak B at 20°, decrease in the order of runs 1–4. As
these peaks were owing to the distance between the helix centers in
the crystalline alignment among the inclusion complexes and the helical
pitch of the amylose helix in the inclusion complex, respectively,36 the XRD results suggested that amylose chains
formed regularly controlled helixes on the PTHF blocks regardless
of the PMeOx block lengths, while regularity of the crystalline alignment
among the complexes (V-amylose) decreased in accordance with the PMeOx
block lengths. Accordingly, upon increasing the PMeOx block lengths,
more hydrophilic spaces were formed among the aligned V-amylose packing
assembly,43 compared with the amylose–PTHF
inclusion complex as shown in Figure 7a,b, resulting in an ability to draw the highly polar
media such as methanol and water for swelling. Peak A at 13°
was detected in the XRD profiles, however, the inclusion complex segments
still interacted, even in lower regularity, to act as cross-linking
points for gelation. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images
of the lyophilized samples from the hydrogels (runs 3 and 4) show
porous structures representatively constructed from the cross-linked
network structures (Figure 4g,h). On the other hand, such a porous morphology is not seen
in the SEM images of the lyophilized samples from any materials of
runs 1 and 2 without gelation (Figure 4e,f).

When DMSO solutions of the products were casted on a glass
plate,
followed by drying, the samples of runs 3 and 4 with the longer PMeOx
chains formed transparent films (Figure 8c,d), whereas the film formation was not
observed with the other samples (runs 1 and 2, Figure 8a,b). The XRD results of the resulting films
exhibit the patterns assignable to the inclusion complexes (Figure 2h,i), whereas such
patterns are not obviously detected in those of the other samples
(Figure 2f,g). These
results suggested that the longer PMeOx blocks present at both ends
of the PTHF blocks were affected to prevent the dissociation of the
complexes in DMSO during the film formation procedure. In addition
to such a stabilization effect by the longer PMeOx chains, the lowered
regularity of crystalline alignment among the inclusion complex segments
in the products of runs 3 and 4 contributed to providing the film
formation properties.

Conclusions
In this study, we investigated vine-twining
polymerization using
the designed amphiphilic triblock copolymer, that is, P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx). The amylose chains
specifically included the PTHF block in the triblock copolymer to
form the inclusion complex having the nonincluded PMeOx chains at
both sides. Accordingly, the PMeOx chains formed hydrophilic spaces
among the inclusion complex segments, in which their regularity of
crystalline alignment was also lowered. Owing to such higher-order
structures, the amylosic supramolecular products formed soft materials,
such as gels and films. The present approach opens up a new way to
provide functions in the amylosic supramolecular inclusion complex.
Furthermore, the resulting supramolecular soft materials in this study
have potential to be employed in practical applications such as biomedical
and environmentally benign fields in the future.

Experimental Section
Materials
MeOx was prepared from acetonitrile and 2-aminoethanol
in the presence of zinc acetate according to the literature procedure
and purified by distillation.44 Tf2O was prepared by dehydration of trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid using phosphorus pentoxide and purified by distillation. PTHF
was prepared by ring-opening polymerization of THF in the presence
of EtOTf according to a literature procedure (Mn = 1890 by 1H NMR).35 Thermostable phosphorylase from Aquifex aeolicus VF5 was supplied from Ezaki Glico Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan.24,45,46

Synthesis of P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx)34
A typical experimental
procedure was as follows (run 2). A mixture of THF (1.76 mL, 20.0
mmol) and Tf2O (0.169 mL, 1.0 mmol) was stirred at 0 °C
for 15 min under argon. After MeOx (1.17 mL, 14.0 mmol) was added
to the resulting solution at −78 °C, the mixture was successively
stirred at that temperature for 1 h, allowed to stand at room temperature
for 30 min, and stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. The reaction was stopped
by addition of sat. NaHCO3 aq. (5.0 mL) to the solution.
After the mixture was concentrated, methanol (100 mL) was added and
inorganic salts were filtered off. After the filtrate was concentrated
and methanol (5.0 mL) was added, the mixture was poured into a hexane
(150 mL)/diethyl ether (100 mL) mixture to precipitate the product.
The precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and dried under reduced
pressure to give P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx) (1.83 g). 1H NMR (CD3OD) δ 1.61
(br, −C–CH2CH2–C–
of PTHF), 2.14 (br, −CH3 of PMeOx), 3.12–3.68
(br, −CH2O– of PTHF, −CH2N– of PMeOx).

A mixture of the resulting copolymer (0.10
g), acetic anhydride (3.0 mL), and pyridine (3.0 mL) was stirred at
room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was then poured into
hexane (100 mL) to precipitate the product, which was isolated by
centrifugation and dried under reduced pressure to give the acetyl-terminated
triblock copolymer (71.4 mg). 1H NMR (CD3OD)
δ 4.08–4.19 (br, −CH2O(C=O)CH3 (terminal acetate methylene)). From the
integrated ratio of this signal to a methylene signal of the PTHF
block (−C–CH2CH2–C−)
at δ 1.57 and a methyl signal of the PMeOx block at δ
2.16, the values of Mn of the triblock
copolymer and DPs of PTHF and PMeOx blocks were calculated to be 2560,
20.0, and 11.6, respectively.

Similarly, the triblock copolymers
of runs 3 and 4 were synthesized
by the subsequent ring-opening polymerization of MeOx (6.77 mL, 80.0
mmol and 8.46 mL, 120 mmol, respectively) from the abovementioned
polymerization solution of THF. After acetylation of the terminal
hydroxy groups, the values of Mn of the
triblock copolymers and DPs of PTHF and PMeOx blocks were estimated
by 1H NMR spectra as shown in Table 1.

Vine-Twining Polymerization
A typical
experimental
procedure was as follows (run 2). A mixture of G-1-P (0.152 g, 0.50
mmol), G7 (5.8 mg, 5.0 μmol), and P(MeOx-block-THF-block-MeOx) (Mn = 2560, 0.256 g, 0.10 mmol) in sodium acetate buffer
(pH = 6.2, 0.2 mol/L, 7.5 mL) was ultrasonicated for 2 h to obtain
a dispersion. After addition of the thermostable phosphorylase (90
U), the mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 24 h. The precipitate
was then filtered, washed with water and methanol, and dried under
reduced pressure to give the inclusion complex (56.5 mg). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 1.49 (br, −C–CH2CH2–C– of PTHF), 1.97 (br, −CH3 of PMeOx), 3.33–3.64 (m, −CH2O–
of PTHF, −CH2N– of PMeOx, H2-H6 of amylose, overlapping with HOD), 5.09 (br, H1), 4.56, 5.39, 5.48 (OH of amylose).

Dissociation of Inclusion
Complexes
A typical experimental
procedure was as follows (run 2). A mixture of the inclusion complex
(40.0 mg) with DMSO (1.0 mL) was heated at 70 °C for 1 h with
stirring for dissolution. The resulting solution was poured into methanol
(50 mL) to precipitate amylose, which was isolated by filtration,
washed with methanol, and dried under reduced pressure (23.9 mg).
The filtrate was concentrated to obtain the guest copolymer (8.0 mg).

The Mn value of the dissociated amylose
was determined by UV–vis analysis of the complex with iodine.41,42 A standard iodine–iodide solution was first prepared by dissolving
potassium iodide (5.2 mg, 0.031 mmol) and iodine (5.2 mg, 0.020 mmol)
in water (10 mL). The amylose sample (1.0 mg) was dissolved in DMSO
(0.20 mL) and the standard iodine–iodide solution (1.0 mL)
was added to the solution. The violet solution was then characterized
by UV–vis spectroscopy to determine the Mn value; λmax = 594.0 nm, Mn = 13250.

Formation of the Hydrogel
After
a mixture of the inclusion
complex (25.0 mg) with methanol (30 mL) was ultrasonicated for 2 h
and centrifuged, the supernatant was decantated off. The paste-like
swollen material was soaked in water (30 mL) for 24 h to obtain the
hydrogel. The water content was calculated by weight difference between
the hydrogel and its lyophilized sample. A mixture of the dissociated
guest copolymer (4.0 mg), acetic anhydride (1.0 mL), and pyridine
(1.0 mL) was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture
was then poured into hexane (50 mL) to precipitate the product, which
was isolated by centrifugation and dried under reduced pressure to
give an acetyl-terminated copolymer (3.1 mg). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 4.14–4.27 (br, −CH2O(C=O)CH3 (terminal acetate
methylene)). From the integrated ratio of this signal to a methylene
signal of the PTHF block (−C–CH2CH2–C−) at δ 1.61 and a methyl signal of the PMeOx
block at δ 2.11, the DP values of PTHF and PMeOx blocks were
calculated to be 29.3 and 9.2, respectively.

Formation of the Film
The inclusion complex (10.0 mg)
was dissolved in DMSO (0.10 mL) by heating at 70 °C for 10 min
with stirring. The resulting solution was casted on a glass plate
and dried under reduced pressure at 70 °C for 2 h to obtain the
film.

Measurements
1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a JEOL ECA600 spectrometer. XRD measurements were performed using
a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer with Ni-filtered
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). UV–vis measurements
were conducted using a Jasco V-650Q1 spectrometer. GPC analysis was
performed by using a pump NPL-5000 (Nihon Seimitsu Kagaku, Co. Ltd.)
and a TOSOH RI detector RI-8020 under the following conditions: a
Shodex GPC LF-804 column with DMSO as the eluent at a flow rate of
0.3 mL/min at room temperature. Pullulan samples were used as standards.
