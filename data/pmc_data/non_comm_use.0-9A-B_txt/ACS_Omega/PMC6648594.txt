Keeping
in view various pharmacological attributes of indole and coumarin
derivatives, a new series of indolindione–coumarin molecular
hybrids was rationally designed and synthesized. All synthesized hybrid
molecules were evaluated for their antimicrobial potential against
Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica), Gram-positive
bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis), and
four fungal strains (Candida albicans, Alternaria mali, Penicillium sp., and Fusarium oxysporum) by using the agar gel diffusion method. Among all synthetics, compounds K-1 and K-2 were found to be the best antimicrobial
agents with the minimum inhibitory concentration values of 30 and
312 μg/mL, against Penicillium sp. and S. aureus, respectively.
The biological data revealed some interesting facts about the structure–activity
relationship which state that the electronic environment on the indolinedione
moiety and carbon chain length between indolinedione and triazole
moieties considerably affect the antimicrobial potential of the synthesized
hybrids. Various types of binding interactions of K-2 within the active site of S. aureus dihydrofolate reductase were also streamlined by molecular modeling
studies, which revealed the possible mechanism for potent antibacterial
activity of the compound.

==== Body
Introduction
Nowadays, microbial
resistance has become a serious threat to human health, which is a
major problematic and most challenging issue to worldwide researchers.
According to the World Health Organization, 50 000 people including
male, female, and children are dying everyday from microbial infections
around globe.1 A report revealed by WHO
stated that approximately 16 million people died in 1990 which was
further decreased by 1% in 2010 (15 million), and it is estimated
to reach 13 million by 2050. No doubt the number of deaths by microbial
infection is falling but with a very slow rate, may be due to burst
increase in the world population and microbial resistance.2 The recent focus on the development of antimicrobial
agents has failed to reach the expectations because of high risk of
toxicity and insufficient antimicrobial activity as well as microbial
resistance, which led to a search for novel antimicrobial agents.3 In the recent past, numerous research strategies
have been successfully utilized to fight against multidrug-resistant
microbial infection. It has been reported that solo targeting agents
are more prone to drug resistance, which fails the expected successful
drug candidate.4 A general belief is that
drugs affecting more than a single target or multiple sites of the
single target showed higher potency and lower resistance as compared
to solo targeting agents.5−9 This can only be achieved by the molecular hybridization technique.

Molecular hybridization is an approach for drug development in
which two different active pharmacophores are clubbed together with
or without the help of a linker. In these days, this approach is the
most popular one in the development of novel drug entities to target
multiple sites.10 Therefore, hybrid molecules
can attenuate the risk of multiple drug resistance as well as a drug–drug
interaction which could be useful for humanity to resist microbial
resistance.

Coumarin is a plant secondary metabolite, that exhibits
a wide variety of biological activities such as antimicrobial and
its derivatives have reported for anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory,
antimicrobial, anti-HIV, antioxidant, antiallergic, anticancer, antiproliferative,
and antiviral activities.11−15 There are numerous evidence on coumarin-based hybrid molecules with
promising antimicrobial potential which includes coumarin–theophylline
hybrids (1), coumarin–carbonodithioate hybrids
(2), coumarin–benzimidazole hybrids (3), coumarin–imidazole hybrids (4), coumarin–thiazolyl
hybrids (5), coumarin–sulfonamide hybrids (6), 2-aminothiazole hybrids (7), and coumarin–dihydropyrimidine
hybrids (8)16−23 (Figure 1)

Figure 1 Recently reported
hybrid molecules as antimicrobial agents.

2,3-Indolinedione, an indole derivative, is considered as
a pharmacological active nucleus with its vast biological applications.
It is generally found in many natural products such as fungal metabolites,
indole alkaloids, and marine natural products. There is a number of
research articles describing the antimicrobial potential of indolinedione-based
hybrids such as propylene-tethered ciprofloxacin–isatin hybrids
(9) and indole isatin hybrids (10)24,25 (Figure 1).

These significant reports provide a strong rationale for the inclusion
of these two active moieties into a single molecular architecture,
which could exhibit low toxicity with significant antimicrobial activity.

Triazole is also an important heterocyclic moiety which plays an
imperative role in medicinal chemistry and can be used for the synthesis
of numerous biologically active molecules such as antimicrobial, anticancer,
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticonvulsant.26−32 This elite class of moiety can then be considered to incorporate
into the molecules to exhibit potential results. There are a number
of molecules exhibiting excellent antimicrobial activity such as fluorinated
chalcone-1,2,3-triazole conjugates (11), coumarin–1,2,3-triazole
hybrids (12), dehydroacetic acid-chalcone-1,2,3-triazole
hybrids (13), 1,2,3-triazole-linked chalcone and flavone
hybrids (14), theophylline containing 1,2,3-triazole
nucleoside derivatives (15), ciprofloxacin-triazole conjugates
(16), and 4-substituted 1,2,3-triazole coumarin hybrids
(17).33−38 This active moiety can then be selected to incorporate into target
molecules as a linker between two active pharmacophoric moieties,
that is, coumarin and indolinedione (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Variously reported triazole-linked hybrid molecules
as antimicrobial agents.

Keeping in view the problem of antimicrobial resistance as
a major limitation of the currently available antimicrobial drugs,
the present study targets at the synthesis of triazole-tethered indolinedione–coumarin
hybrids by using a click chemistry approach (Figure 3) and evaluation against various bacterial
and fungal strains. The zone of inhibition was determined for all
synthetics, and the potent compounds were selected to calculate their
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Furthermore, various
binding interactions of the most potent compound were also explored
by using molecular modeling studies.

hybrid molecules.

Results and Discussion
Indolinedione–coumarin hybrids were synthesized by following
the synthetic Scheme 1. First, substituted indolinedione was stirred with 1,2-dibromoalkanes
(1 equiv) at room temperature by using dimethylformamide (DMF) as
the solvent and K2CO3 (1.5 equiv) as the base.
The resulting product was then dissolved in DMF and then NaN3 (1 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
to form 1-(4-azidoalkyl)indoline-2,3-diones.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Indolinedione–Coumarin
Hybrids
Reagents and conditions: (a) K2CO3, DMF, 2 h, stir, rt; (b) NaN3, DMF,
1 h, stir, rt; (c) propargyl bromide, K2CO3,
DMF, 2 h, stir, rt; and (d) sodium ascorbate, CuSO4, DMF,
15 min, rt.

Separately, 4(prop-2-ynyloxy)-2H-chromen-2-one (PHC) was obtained by stirring the reaction
mixture of 4-hydroxycoumarin and propargyl bromide (1.2 equiv to 4-hydroxycoumarin)
in DMF under basic conditions (K2CO3; 1.5 equiv).

This 4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)-2H-chromen-2-one (PHC)
was further reacted with various 1-(4-azidoalkyl)indoline-2,3-dione
analogues in the presence of pentahydrate CuSO4 (catalytic
amount) and sodium ascorbate (as a reducing agent of CuSO4), in DMF at room temperature to obtain the desired hybrid compounds. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques were
used to characterize the synthesized compounds, and all spectral data
were found in accordance with assumed structures.

In Vitro Evaluation
Antibacterial
Activity
All synthesized hybrids were tested against two
Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) and two
Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis). The
results showed that almost all of the compounds are active against
the tested micro-organisms. Among these strains, S.
aureus was the most sensitive one, and E. coli was the most resistant strain to the hybrid
molecules. Compound K-2 was found to be the most potent
which exhibited 2.5 and 1.3 cm inhibition zone against S. aureus and S. enterica, respectively (Figure 4A). An interesting structure–activity relationship has also
been established from Table 1 which revealed that electron density on the fifth position
of the indolinedione moiety greatly influences the antibacterial potential.
Activity increased with increase in electronegativity on the fifth
position of indolinedione. It has also been cleared from the data
that the chain length of two carbon atoms which joins the triazole
moiety to indolinedione, was a most tolerable linker. Thus, the overall
preference order for antibacterial potential for indolinedione is
F > Cl > Br > I > NO2 > OCH3 >
H and for linker spacer length: n = 1 > 2 >
3 (Figure 5). For determination
of MIC of the most potent hybrid (K-2) against S. aureus, different concentrations were prepared
and tested. Results showed that the compound at a concentration of
5 mg/mL was quite effective against the tested organism and exhibited
a maximum zone of inhibition of 2.5 cm (Figure 4a), whereas negative control colistin and
dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) showed no zone of inhibition (Figure 4b). MIC of K-2 was found to be 312 μg/mL where the minimum zone of inhibition
of 0.1 cm was observed, which was found comparable to that of norfloxacin
against S. aureus (MIC = 128 μg/mL).39

Antifungal Activity
Synthesized compounds were also tested
against four fungal strains, namely, Candida albicans, Alternaria mali, Penicillium sp., and Fusarium oxysporum by using the agar gel diffusion method. Most of the compounds were
active against Penicillium sp. amongst
which compound K-1 was endowed with the most prominent
zone of inhibition, that is, 2.5 cm. K-2 was found to
be the second most potent compound against Penicillium sp. with 1.3 cm inhibition zone. The compounds were inactive against
the C. albicans fungal strain which
indicates that indolinedione–coumarin hybrids could be used
for the treatment of infectious disease, associated with Penicillium sp. The structure–activity relationship
revealed that the unsubstituted indolinedione moiety is the most crucial
one for antifungal activity. Further activity falls in the order of
the electronegative effect with exception of fluorine and chlorine
atoms. The preference order for antifungal activity thus became: R
= H > Cl > F > Br > I > NO2 > OCH3. The effect of chain length was found similar to that of
antibacterial in the order of n = 1 > 2 > 3
(Figure 5). To determine
MIC of the most potent compound K-1, different concentrations
were tested against Penicillium sp.
Results in (Figure 4c) showed that the compound at a concentration of 30 μg/mL
was quite effective against the tested organism and exhibited a maximum
zone of inhibition of 2.5 cm, whereas DMSO showed no zone of inhibition.
The results were found comparable to that of clinically used drug
fluconazole against Penicillium sp.
which was found to exhibit an MIC value of 4.072 μg/mL.40 It was clearly observed that with a decrease
in concentration from 30 to 7.5 μg/mL, there was a decrease
in the zone of inhibition and for last two concentrations (3.75 &
1.875 μg/mL), no zone of inhibition was observed (Figure 4d). Although synthesized compound K-1 at a concentration of 15 and 7.5 μg/mL affects the
growth of the tested organism, it also showed more effect on sporulation/pigmentation.
Spores were not pigmented in the presence of the compound.

The
most potent hybrid compounds K-1 and K-2 were also tested for their toxicity to the microbial strains. Both
the compounds at their MIC values did not kill the microbial strains
and they only found to inhibit the growth of the microbes. This confirmed
that the observed potential of the compounds is solely due to their
inherent antimicrobial activity.

Overall biological data suggested
that the most potent compounds (K-1 and K-2) could act as hit lead molecules for further development of potent
antimicrobial agents. As hybrid molecules, these agents perform better
results as compared to standard drugs, colistin and fluconazole (marketed
drugs). In contrast to this, the use of bifunctionalities in a single
molecular architecture could also mitigate the drug–drug interactions
as well as the chance of microbial resistance. Most interestingly,
compound K-1 significantly inhibits the growth of S. aureus. S. aureus is one of the most common causes of infective endocarditis, bacteremia,
and various drastic skin and soft tissue infections. It can lay dormant
for years undetected in the human body and may cause dreadful conditions
if not treated. In this regard, the study suggests that K-1 could be used as a future drug candidate to treat various infections
attributed to S. aureus.

Docking Studies
For deep and clear perception to analyze the molecular mechanism
of the most potent antibacterial compound K-2, molecular
modeling studies were performed on S. aureus dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR is a key enzyme in folate metabolism
and a valuable target for antibacterial drugs. The docking protocol
was validated by reproducing the X-ray derived conformation of 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline
at the DHFR binding site (PDB entry: 3SRQ). The three-dimensional (3D) coordinates
of 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline were extracted and docked at the
active site using GoldScore, ChemScore, ASP, and ChemPLP scoring functions.
GoldScore has reproduced the best fit conformation of 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline
with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.104 which ensures the reliability
of the selected docking protocol. Therefore, GoldScore was selected
as a fitness function for the docking study. Ten conformations of K-2 were generated and ranked according to their GoldScore.
The conformation with the highest GoldScore (61.63) was selected for
discussion.

The binding site residues and overall binding mode
of K-2 suggest that it fits well in the binding cavity
and gets stabilized by various electrostatic interactions (Figure 6). The major interactions
between K-2 and DHFR include van der Waal’s, π–π
stacking, and H-bond interactions. The 5-fluoro-indoline-2,3-dione
moiety gets positioned in a cavity formed by Val7, Ala8, Ile15, Leu21
(hydrophobic residues) and Trp23 (aromatic residue). Here, the backbone
−NH of Ala8 has shown an H-bond interaction with carbonyl oxygen
present at the benzene ring of the indolinedione moiety (H-bond acceptor; d = 1.382 Å). The triazole ring is involved in a face-to-face
π–π stacking interaction with Phe93 (d = 4.035 Å) (Figure 6a). This arrangement of energetically favorable π–π
stacking interactions has also seen in the cocrystal structure of
DHFR with 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline (d = 4.603
Å)41 (Figure 6a). The coumarin moiety is surrounded by
hydrophobic residues which include Leu29, Val32, Lys33, Ile51, and
Leu55 (Figure 6b).
It is perfectly sandwiched between the aliphatic side chain of Leu29
and Leu55 and stabilized by van der Waals and/or dispersion interactions.
The study suggests that K-2 may block the activity of
DHFR sufficiently enough to prevent the substrate from binding to
its active site.

site of DHFR (hydrogens which are involved in H-bond interactions
are shown); (b) two-dimensional depiction of various residues involved
in D–R interactions.

In Silico Studies
Compounds which exhibited above 0.5 cm
zone of inhibition in sensitive microbial strains, namely, S. aureus and Penicillium sp. (K-1 to K-7 and L-1 to L-3) were subjected to determine their physicochemical properties
by using web-based software, MarvinSketch (http://www.chemaxon.com/) and
PreADMET (http://preadmet.bmdrc.org/) (Table 2). The results
of the in silico study revealed that all compounds are less likely
to cause neurotoxicity and could not hinder the normal action of neuronal
cells, confirmed by the predicted in silico values. Table 3 summarized the drug likeliness
properties of the synthesized compounds which were determined by the
online softwares, ChemAxon and MarvinSketch. Table 3 indicated that all synthesized compounds
fit well with the Lipinski rule of five. Tabular values indicated
that (a) all synthetics have molecular weights within the limits of
180–500, except K-5, (b) synthesized compounds
have no H-bond donating site at all, (c) compounds have hydrogen bond
accepting ability but complies with H-bond acceptor criteria (<10),
(d) the molar refractivity was found in the range of 121.16–134.53
cm3 mol–1, which also obeys the accepting
limit of 40–130, and (e) the log P of all
compounds indicate that the compounds are not very lipophilic (<5.6).
From these results, it can be stated that the compounds could be pharmacologically
efficient for clinical use in the future as they follow the Lipinski
rule of five except K-5.

Conclusions
In the present study, indolinedione–coumarin molecular hybrids
were designed, synthesized, and characterized by using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. All synthetics were assessed for the
antimicrobial activity against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacterial and fungal strains and their zone of inhibition was calculated.
Among all synthetics, compounds K-1 and K-2 were found to exhibit a maximum zone of inhibition (2.5 cm) against Penicillium sp. and S. aureus, respectively. The most potent antibacterial compound K-2 displayed an MIC of 312 μg/mL, while the most potent antifungal
compound K-1 exhibited an MIC value of 30 μg/mL.
The structure–activity relationship established from biological
results states that the electronic environment on the indolinedione
moiety greatly affected the antimicrobial activity of the hybrid molecules.
The activity decreased with the increase in chain length between the
triazole and indolinedione moieties. Moreover, various binding interactions
of the most potent compound K-2, within the catalytic
active site of S. aureus DHFR, were
also streamlined by using docking studies which revealed the probable
mechanism for its potent antibacterial potential. Thus, the overall
study concluded that indolinedione–coumarin hybrids could act
as a hit lead for further developments of antimicrobial agents.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Measurements
The chemical reagents were
procured from CDH, Sigma-Aldrich, and Loba, India. All yields refer
to isolated products after purification. Products were characterized
by comparing with authentic samples and by spectroscopic techniques,
that is, 1H and 13C NMR, elemental analysis.
AVANCE III HD 500 MHz Bruker Biospin and JEOL AL 300 MHz machines
were used to record the NMR spectra. The spectra were recorded by
dissolving in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) (0.00 ppm). In 1H
NMR, chemical shifts were reported in δ values using the internal
standard (TMS) with a number of protons, multiplicities (s-singlet,
d-doublet, t-triplet, q-quartet, and m-multiplet), and coupling constants
(J) in hertz (Hz). Melting points were determined
in open capillaries and were uncorrected.

(1 equiv) and K2CO3 (1.5 equiv) were added.
The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature. After the completion
of reaction as confirmed by TLC, the reaction mixture was poured on
crushed ice. The impure product so obtained was filtered, air dried,
and subjected to column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate as eluent)
to gain the desired product, that is, 1-(2-bromoethyl)indoline-2,3-dione.
All other 1-bromoalkylindoline-2,3-diones were synthesized via the
same procedure as mentioned above using various dibromoalkanes.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 1-(4-Azidobutyl)indoline-2,3-dione
(IBA)
In minimum amount of DMF, 1-(4-bromobutyl)indoline-2,3-dione
(1 equiv) was dissolved, sodium azide (1 equiv) was added, and the
mixture was stirred at room temperature. After the completion of reaction,
it was poured on crushed ice, precipitated (1-(4-azidobutyl)indoline-2,3-dione),
and thus were collected by simple filtration. The physical data of
1-(4-azidobutyl)indoline-2,3-dione are given below:

All other 1-azidoalkylindoline-2,3-dione analogues
were synthesized by following the abovementioned procedure.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Triazole-Linked Indoline-2,3-dione–Coumarin
Hybrids
In DMF, 1-azidoalkylindoline-2,3-dione(1 equiv) and
4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)-2H-chromen-2-one (PHC) (1 equiv)
were dissolved. The catalytic amount of pentahydrate copper sulfate
(CuSO4·5H2O) and its reducing agent, sodium
ascorbate was added in it. The reaction mixture was kept aside for
some time, at room temperature. After the completion of reaction as
confirmed by TLC, the reaction mixture was filtered directly on crushed
ice to remove the excess of CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate.
The solidified final product thus obtained was filtered and air dried.
The physical data of all synthesized bifunctional hybrids are given
below:

In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity
Agar plate diffusion assay
was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity. Twenty different
compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity against test organisms,
namely, E. coli, S.
enterica, S. aureus, M. smegmatis, C.
albicans, A. mali, Penicillium sp., and F. oxysporum. A quantity of 50 μL of each synthesized compound was added
in the wells of nutrient agar plates (for bacteria) and potato dextrose
agar plates (for fungi), seeded with 100 μL of activated test
cultures (E. coli, S.
enterica, S. aureus, M. smegmatis, C.
albicans, A. mali, Penicillium sp., and F. oxysporum). The plates were incubated at 37 °C (bacteria) and 30 °C
(fungi) under aerobic conditions for 24–48 h, and the clear
zones of inhibition around the compounds were measured and compared
with the negative control.42

MIC Determination
To determine MIC, different concentrations of the active compound
(K-2: 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, and 0.156 mg/mL) were
prepared in DMSO, and 50 μL of each concentration was added
in the well of the nutrient agar plate, seeded with S. aureus. The plates were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h, and the clear zones of inhibition around the different concentrations
of the compound were measured and compared with the negative control.

Similarly, for determining MIC of K-1, different concentrations
(30, 15, 7.5, 3.75, and 1.875 μg/mL) were prepared in DMSO,
and 50 μL of each concentration was added in the well of the
potato dextrose agar plate, seeded with Penicillium sp. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24–48 h,
and the clear zones of inhibition around the different concentrations
of the compound were measured and compared with the negative control.

Docking Study
The X-ray-derived 3D co-ordinates of S. aureus DHFR bound with 7-aryl-2,4-diaminoquinazoline
were retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB entry: 3SRQ; resolution 1.69
Å).41 GOLD software version 5.5 was
used to perform the docking study.42 Gold
executes genetic algorithm-based ligand docking to optimize the conformation
of the ligand at the receptor binding site. GoldScore comprises four
components: protein–ligand hydrogen bond energy, protein–ligand
van der Waals (vdW) energy, ligand internal vdW energy, and ligand
torsional strain energy. The structure of K-2 was drawn
in ChemDraw Ultra (2006) and subjected to energy minimization using
the MM2 force field as implemented in Chem 3D Ultra software.43,44 The compounds were docked ten times, and each pose was ranked according
to its GoldScore fitness function. The conformation with the highest
score was selected for discussion.
