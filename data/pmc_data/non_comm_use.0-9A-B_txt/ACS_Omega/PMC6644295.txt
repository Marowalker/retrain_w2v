This manuscript details
a novel and simple approach to achieve
surface-tethered co-poly(ionic liquid) (coPIL) films through the exchange
of the resident anion of a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) film with two
or more anions. Initially, surface-tethered PIL films were prepared
by the surface-initiated ring-opening metathesis polymerization of
the ionic liquid monomer 3-[(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)methyl]-1,2-dimethylimidazol-3-ium
hexafluorophosphate ([N1-dMIm][PF6]) whose PF6– anion was easily interchanged with aqueous
solutions containing a binary mixture of the PF6− anion, along with perchlorate (ClO4−) or bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI−) anions. The
binary mole fraction of each anion in the film was determined from
the infrared spectra of the coPIL films. The thermodynamically driven
anion selectivity for exchange from the liquid phase into the coPIL
films was determined to follow the order ClO4– < PF6– < FSI–. The aqueous wettability of p[N1-dMIm] coPIL films containing
both the PF6– and ClO4– anions (p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4]) was quantified by contact angle goniometry with the observation
that the surface showed an enrichment in the ClO4– anion compared to the average binary anion mole fraction of ClO4– in the film (yClO4–). The rate of ion transport through
the p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL films,
quantified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, linearly depends
on the binary anion mole fraction of ClO4– in solution (xClO4–), enabling continuous tunability by over three orders of magnitude
for ion conductivity in the coPIL films.

1 Introduction
Poly(ionic
liquids) (PILs) comprise a polymeric backbone with an
IL species in each of the repeat units, enabling the tuning of the
material properties in discrete quantities by anion or cation exchange.1−9 PILs have been utilized for multiple applications including energy
harvesting and storage, sensing, drug and gene delivery, separations,
catalysis, polymer electrolytes, sorbents, dispersants, smart materials,
and responsive materials.1,3−6,9,10 A
co-poly(ionic liquid) (coPIL) is a polymer that is composed of repeating
units with differing molecular structure where one or more repeats
contains an IL species. A coPIL affords additional degrees of freedom
for the modulation of material properties due to the combination of
multiple ionic and/or nonionic moieties in the polymer to yield random
and block coPILs.3−6,11−13 Copolymerization
of an IL monomer with a nonionic monomer results in coPILs with a
dilute charge character through the reduced concentration of ionic
moieties along the polymer backbone.3−6,11−16 CoPILs with opposite charges on the backbone17,18 or those with a uniform polymer backbone and differing counterions,19−21 obtained by the copolymerization of an anionic monomer with a cationic
monomer or by the copolymerization of monomers having the same polymerizable
moieties but differing counterions, respectively, can lead to coPILs
with enhanced ionic conductivities.3,5 In all the
previously mentioned approaches, the synthetic burdens intrinsic in
the formation of different monomer units, as well as the inherent
challenges in determining the optimal polymerization conditions for
coPIL formation, must be overcome.

In this article, we report
a straightforward approach to achieve
surface-tethered coPIL films via anion exchange. Initially, surface-immobilized
PIL films on planar gold substrates were prepared by the surface-initiated
ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of 3-[(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)methyl]-1,2-dimethylimidazol-3-ium
hexafluorophosphate ([N1-dMIm][PF6]), whose
PF6– anion can be easily exchanged to
alter film properties in discrete quantities.2 In our approach, surface-immobilized p[N1-dMIm][PF6] films are immersed in aqueous solutions containing a binary
mixture of anions to exchange with the resident PF6– anion to achieve random surface-tethered coPILs via
a novel and rapid route. This route to coPILs is advantageous as compared
to traditional copolymerization strategies in that it only requires
the synthesis of one monomeric unit to achieve random coPIL films.
The composition of the random coPIL films can easily be controlled
in a continuous manner by varying the binary mole fraction of each
anion in solution prior to anion exchange. The formation of random
coPILs via anion exchange is a reversible process allowing for the
regeneration of the PIL homopolymer by anion exchange. By simply exposing
the coPIL film to a solution containing the anion of the homopolymer,
we are able to reverse the formation of the coPIL. In this way, the
intrinsic advantages of PILs are retained and enhanced by the ability
to easily prepare coPIL films from the PIL homopolymers. Further,
use of surface-tethered films facilitates an easy separation of the
coPIL films from the anion exchange solution while enabling large
anion-induced changes in film and surface properties.

Based
on our recent work, p[N1-dMIm] films containing
the PF6– and ClO4– anions exhibit dramatically different film properties,2 which motivated our choice of these anions in
this work. In particular, p[N1-dMIm][PF6] films exhibit
an advancing water contact angle of 61 ± 2° and a film conductivity
of 0.008 ± 0.001 μS/cm, whereas p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] films exhibit an advancing water contact angle of 35 ±
3° and a film conductivity of ≥13.6 ± 0.8 μS/cm.2 Therefore, a p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] film can provide a versatile test bed to elucidate
the effects of anion composition on both wettability and ion conduction.
Our recent work enabled us to discretely vary film properties based
on the selection of anion. Here, the focus is on coPIL films by using
mixtures of two anions for the continuous tunability of film properties
between the extremes of the two homopolymers. Achieving continuous
tunability over three orders of magnitude for a thin film for the
first time demonstrates a significant advance in control over our
prior discrete approach based on single anion exchange.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 p[N1-dMIm] CoPIL
Film
Polymerization of the IL monomer 3-[(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)methyl]-1,2-dimethylimidazol-3-ium
hexafluorophosphate ([N1-dMIm][PF6]) at a concentration
of 0.1 M in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) for 15 min leads to a surface-tethered
p[N1-dMIm][PF6] film with a thickness of 650
± 30 nm.2 The successful anion exchange
of the resident PF6– anion by exposure
to an aqueous solution containing a mixture of the potassium salts
of PF6– and ClO4–, to form a p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL film, is evidenced by the IR spectra in Figure 1. The IR spectrum for the p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] film displays both
the P–F stretching peak at 855 cm–1 and the
Cl–O stretching peak at 1106 cm–1 and retains
the absorbance bands due to the polymer carbon backbone.2 The binary anion mole fractions of PF6– (yPF6–) and ClO4– (yClO4–) in the coPIL film
were determined as described in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Representative polarization modulation-infrared reflectance–absorption
spectra of p[N1-dMIm] films with PF6– and ClO4– anions and of a coPIL film
on gold substrates. The P–F stretching peak is observed at
855 cm–1, and the Cl–O stretching peak is
observed at 1106 cm–1.

The thermodynamic equilibrium for the partitioning of each
anionic
species between the film and the aqueous solution was investigated
by plotting the binary anion mole fraction of ClO4– in the film (yClO4–) as a function of the binary anion mole
fraction of ClO4– in solution (xClO4–) used in
the anion exchange of p[N1-dMIm] films from both pure p[N1-dMIm][PF6] (Figure 2a) and pure p[N1-dMIm][ClO4]
(Figure 2b) films.
The p[N1-dMIm] films exhibit a high selectivity for PF6– in the film, as evidenced by the fact
that all the data lie below the x = y line. For example, exchange of p[N1-dMIm][PF6] films in a xClO4– = 0.5 aqueous binary anion solution results in a p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL film with yClO4– = 0.13 ± 0.02.
The results for the anion exchange from p[N1-dMIm][PF6] films are not statistically different from those for the
anion exchange from p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] films,
indicating that the conditions for anion exchange were sufficient
to achieve equilibrium (see the Supporting Information).

the film (yClO4–) as a function of the binary anion mole fraction of ClO4– in solution (xClO4–) for p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL films. (a) p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL films prepared from p[N1-dMIm][PF6] films. (b) p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL films prepared from p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] films. Each value was determined by obtaining the average
and standard deviation of at least three independently prepared films.
Solid curves are fits of the data with eq 5. The dashed line is the x = y line.

In order to express the partitioning preference of the PF6– and ClO4– anions
from the liquid phase into the solid phase, an equilibrium constant
was derived using the chemical potential of each anion in the liquid
and solid phase. For the exchange reaction involving ions a and b 1  the chemical potentials of the species in
liquid (μi°,l) and solid (μi°,s) can be described by 2   3  to give 4  where Δμi° = Δμa° + Δμb°. Rearranging eq 4, we obtain 5  where α
can be thought of as the selectivity
of the anion b for the solid phase compared to that for anion a. Equation 5 was used to fit
the data shown in Figure 2a yielding α = 7 ± 1 and the data shown in Figure 2b yielding α
= 6 ± 1. These values of α demonstrate a selectivity for
the film for PF6– as compared to ClO4–, as well as an attainment of equilibrium
due to the same value of α determined using the different PIL
homopolymers.

To further investigate the effect of the anion
on coPIL formation,
we studied coPIL films with PF6– and
FSI– anions. The binary mole fractions of (FSI– and PF6–) in the p[N1-dMIm][PF6][FSI] coPIL film were determined as
described in the Supporting Information. The binary anion mole fraction of FSI– in the
film (yFSI–) as a function
of the binary anion mole fraction of FSI– in solution
(xFSI–) for p[N1-dMIm][PF6][FSI] coPIL films is displayed in Figure 3. The p[N1-dMIm] films exhibit high selectivity for FSI– as
compared to PF6– in the film, as evidenced
by the fact that the data lie above the x = y line. For example, anion exchange of p[N1-dMIm][PF6] films in a xFSI– = 0.5 aqueous binary anion solution results in a p[N1-dMIm][PF6][FSI] coPIL film with yFSI– = 0.78 ± 0.01.

Figure 3 Binary anion mole fraction
of FSI– in the film
(yFSI–) as a function
of the binary anion mole fraction of FSI– in solution
(xFSI–) for p[N1-dMIm][PF6][FSI] coPIL films prepared by anion
exchange. Each value was determined by obtaining the average and standard
deviation of at least three independently prepared films. The solid
curve is a fit of the data with eq 5.

The PF6– anion has a strong partitioning
toward the aqueous environment for the p[N1-dMIm][PF6][FSI] films but a strong partitioning toward the film for
the p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] films.
This leads to a ranking of the relative free energy stabilization
in the solid phase as ClO4– > PF6– > FSI–.

2.2 Contact Angle
Considering the fact
that the anion affects the surface wettability of surface-tethered
ILs with water,22 in addition to the aqueous
solubility of PILs,3,5 the surface wettability of the
p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL films
was assessed by contact angle goniometry as shown in Figure 4. We have previously shown
that the advancing water contact angle (θA) of a
p[N1-dMIm][PF6] film (61 ± 2°) is
greater than the θA of a p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] film (35 ± 3°),2 which
we attribute to the stronger interaction of water with ClO4–, as compared to PF6–, to stabilize the water/polymer interface. For surfaces with microscopic
heterogeneity, the Cassie equation (eq 6) provides a prediction of the measured contact angle
(θ) from those of the homogenous surfaces (θi)23 6  where fi is the fraction of the surface covered by component i. In Figure 4, the dashed line represents the Cassie relationship for a p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] coPIL film. The θA for the p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] film, however, lies below the Cassie line, indicating an enrichment
of the surface in the ClO4– anion, compared
to the average binary anion mole fraction of ClO4– in the film (yClO4–). For example, yClO4– = 0.5 results in a θA that
is statistically the same as that for a pure ClO4– film. Given that the interface is thermodynamically distinct from
bulk, the minimization of interfacial free energy between the polymer
film and the aqueous phase results in a surface enrichment of the
ClO4– anion.

of ClO4– in the film (yClO4–). The dashed line is
a prediction by eq 6 for
a film combining the PF6– and the ClO4– anions.

2.3 p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] CoPIL Film Ion Transport
We have previously shown
that the film anion governs the ion transport resistance of p[N1-dMIm] films with no impact from the electrolyte cation.2 The ion transport resistance of the p[N1-dMIm] films was shown to follow the order ClO4– ≪ FSI– ≪ −NTf2 < PF6–.2 p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4]
ion transport was investigated by utilizing electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS). In EIS, a low amplitude sinusoidal potential (Eac) perturbation of varying frequency is applied
around the equilibrium potential of the working electrode.24 The Eac drives the
motion of ions (ionic conductivity) through the film as mediated by
the exchange of ions between the liquid and solid phases. EIS was
conducted in the presence of an aqueous electrolyte solution consisting
of a mixture of the potassium salts of PF6– and ClO4– anions at a total anion concentration
of 0.1 M. The xClO4– for the electrolyte solution was equal to the xClO4– for the binary anion
exchange solution utilized in the formation of the coPIL films to
avoid net ion exchange during collection of the EIS spectra. Figure 5 shows representative
Bode plots of EIS spectra for p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] films with the corresponding phase angle plots
in Figure S4 (see the Supporting Information). To determine resistances and capacitances for the films [Tables 1 and S1 (see the Supporting Information)], the spectra were fit
using the equivalent circuit model in Scheme 1.

Figure 5 Electrochemical impedance spectra in the Bode
format for p[N1-dMIm][PF6] (yClO4– = 0), p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] (yClO4– = 1), and p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4]
films with varying binary film anion mole fractions of ClO4– (yClO4–). A 0.1 M aqueous electrolyte solution prepared using KPF6 and KClO4 salts and consisting of the same xClO4– used to prepare
the coPIL film, was used to collect the spectra. The fits of the spectra
to the equivalent circuit in Scheme 1 are displayed as solid curves.

a The maximum film
resistance for
the p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] film was estimated as being
no larger than the Rs (4.34 ± 0.04
Ω·cm2) for EIS spectra of a p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] film in a 0.5 M Ca(ClO4)2 electrolyte
solution.2

The film capacitance (Cf), which quantifies
the charge separation between the metal surface and the bulk solution,
as well as ion migration resistance (Rf) due to the PIL film, are typically observed in the intermediate
frequency range of the working electrode potential perturbation. Figure 5 shows that the EIS
spectra for the pure films (yClO4– = 0 and yClO4– = 1) are dramatically different.
The yClO4– = 0 film exhibits a large resistance to ion transport compared to
the yClO4– = 1 film. This difference in resistance is attributed to the difference
in the interaction of the PF6– and ClO4– anions with the aqueous environment and
the film. Molecular dynamics simulations of a 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
hexafluorophosphate ([C4-MIm][PF6]) IL show
that the butyl group reorients in the presence of water to preferentially
interact with the IL bulk, and because of a weak interaction between
the F atoms of the PF6– anion and H atoms
of water, no appreciable miscibility with water was observed.25 However, ClO4– anions
have a negligible impact on the hydrogen bond (H-bond) network in
bulk water because of the transitional character of the water–perchlorate
H-bond, which mirrors the dynamic, labile H-bond networks observed
for liquid water, resulting in a strong interaction between the ClO4– anion and water molecules.26,27 As the PF6– anions in solution migrate
toward the working electrode because of changes in potential, an exchange
of PF6– anions from the solution phase
to the film phase occurs. As a result of the weak interaction between
the PF6– anions and water, the thermodynamic
equilibrium lies toward the film, and a large ion transport resistance
through the p[N1-dMIm][PF6] film is observed.
However, because of the strong interaction of the ClO4– anions with water, a minimal resistance to ion transport
arises because of a rapid exchange of ions between the film and the
liquid.

The conversion of the film resistance values (Rf) to a film conductivity (κf) is accomplished
by using 7  where l is the film
thickness, A is the cross-sectional area of the sample,
and R is the measured resistance. The κf of
the coPIL films varies by over three orders of magnitude, from 0.01
μS/cm (yClO4– = 0) to at least 14 μS/cm (yClO4– = 1). A constant phase element (CPE)
was used instead of a capacitor to provide a good fit to the EIS spectra
of Figure 5. The CPE
can be converted into an effective capacitance by using 8  where fm″ is the frequency at which
the imaginary part of the impedance (Z″) has a maximum.28 Capacitance values
increase gently from 0.17 μF/cm2 (yClO4– = 0) to 0.23 μF/cm2 (yClO4– = 0.72). For yClO4– = 1, a film capacitance is not observed because of the absence
of an obvious RC time constant for the film.

Figure 6 shows the
dependence of xClO4– on the normalized film resistance (Rf/Rf(PF6)) obtained
from a fit of the EIS spectra with the equivalent circuit of Scheme 1. The Rf of the coPIL films observed in Figures 5 and 6 decreases with
an increase in xClO4– and yClO4–, with a linear decrease of Rf with xClO4–. The Rf measured for the coPIL films is an indirect
measure of both the thermodynamic driving force for anion exchange
as well as the ionic mobility of the anion. The ionic mobility of
PF6– is 5.6 × 104 m2·S mol–1, while that of ClO4– is 6.7 × 104 m2·S
mol–1.29 The similarity
in mobility, however, does not fully explain the observation that
the Rf for p[N1-dMIm][PF6] films is at least 3 orders of magnitude greater than that
of p[N1-dMIm][ClO4] films as shown in Table 1, leading to the conclusion
that the differences in Rf are largely
due to the thermodynamic driving force rather than ion mobility. The Rf of the p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] films is linearly dependent on xClO4– because of the sensitivity
of EIS to the motions of PF6– compared
to ClO4–. For example, for a coPIL film
prepared from a solution with xClO4– = 0.5, the solution contains equal mole
fractions of ClO4– and PF6– anions. However, because the ClO4– anions contribute very little to the Rf but yet still participate in anion exchange with the
film, the Rf of the coPIL film is determined
by the continuous anion exchange of the PF6– anions with the film, resulting in half the value of the Rf measured for a pure PF6– solution (xClO4– = 0). Figure 6 demonstrates the ability to continuously tune the ion transport
of the coPIL films by controlling the composition of their environment.
This environmentally responsive film resistance could be useful in
the design of dynamic and ion-sensitive films.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
Chromium-coated tungsten
rods were purchased from R.D. Mathis, gold shot (99.99%) was acquired
from J&J Materials, and silicon (100) wafers were obtained from
WRS Materials. A Millipore Elix filtration system was used to produce
deionized water (≥10.0 MΩ).

The following chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further modification:
3-bromopyridine, 4-mercapto-1-butanol (95%), dicyclopentadiene (98%),
Grubbs catalyst second generation [(H2IMes)(PCy3)(Cl)2Ru = CHph], and trans-3,6-endomethylene-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthaloyl
chloride (NBDAC). The following chemicals were purchased from Fisher

1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), 1,2-dimethylimidazole (98%, dMIm), ethanol
(200 Proof), methylene chloride (DCM), potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide
(KFSI), potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6), and potassium
perchlorate (KClO4).

Grubbs third generation catalyst
([(H2IMes) (3-Br-py)2(Cl)2Ru = CHPh])
was synthesized as described by
Love et al.30 3-[(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)methyl]-1,2-dimethylimidazol-3-ium
hexafluorophosphate ([N1-dMIm][PF6]) was synthesized
as described by Njoroge et al.2

3.2 Polymerization on Gold Substrates
Silicon (100) wafers,
rinsed with water and ethanol and dried in
a stream of nitrogen, were used to prepare gold-coated silicon wafers
by sequentially depositing thin films of chromium (100 Å) and
gold (1250 Å) through thermal evaporation in a diffusion-pumped
chamber (CVC-PSM66 evaporator) at a base pressure of ≤4 ×
10–6 Torr and a rate of 1–2 Å s–1. 1.2 cm × 4 cm gold-coated silicon substrates
obtained by cutting the gold-coated wafers were placed in a 1 mM ethanolic
solution of 4-mercapto-1-butanol for a minimum of 1 h to yield a chemisorbed
hydroxyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer. Subsequently, the films
were rinsed with ethanol, water, and ethanol and dried in a stream
of nitrogen, after which they were exposed to a 5 mM solution of NBDAC
in DCM for a minimum of 30 min to yield the acylation product of a
surface-tethered norbornenyl group.31 The
NBDAC films were rinsed with DCM, ethanol, water, and ethanol and
dried in a stream of nitrogen.

The norbornenyl-modified substrates
were then exposed to a 5 mM solution of Grubbs third generation catalyst
in DCM for 12 min, rendering them active for ROMP. The ROMP-active
substrates were quickly rinsed with DCE and immediately placed in
a 0.1 M [N1-dMIm][PF6] solution in DCE for up
to 15 min. The substrates were subsequently rinsed with DCM, ethanol,
water, and ethanol and dried in a stream of nitrogen.

3.3 Anion Exchange
Aqueous solutions
(0.2 M) containing the pure salts of the desired anions were prepared
and combined volumetrically to achieve a 0.2 M binary mixture of the
anion salts at the desired mole fraction in the exchange solution.
The anion exchange of p[N1-dMIm] films containing a resident
anion was accomplished by immersing the film in the exchange solution
for a minimum of 2 h. The substrates were subsequently rinsed with
water and ethanol and dried in a stream of nitrogen.

3.4 Characterization
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the surface-tethered films were collected
using polarization modulation-infrared reflection–absorption
spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). PM-IRRAS was performed using a Bruker TENSOR
27 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a PEM-90 photoelastic modulator
(Hinds Instruments) and a liquid-nitrogen cooled mercury–cadmium–telluride
detector with a nondichroic BaF2 window. The source beam
employed a half-wavelength (λ/2) retardation modulated at a
frequency of 50 kHz and set at 85° incident to the sample surface.
Spectra were collected over 5 min (360 scans) at a resolution of 4
cm–1.

The thickness of the surface-tethered
films was determined by performing profilometry on three 1 mm long
scans per sample across a hand-made scratch defect used to establish
a baseline for polymer growth. Profilometric thicknesses were determined
using a Veeco Dektak 150 stylus profilometer. Measurements were performed
using a stylus with a 12.5 μm radius, applying 29.4 μN
of force and operating in the hills and valleys detection mode. The
scan duration was varied to collect the height data every 0.028 μm.
Each scan was plane-fitted using the instrument software. Reported
values represent the averages and standard deviations of at least
three independently prepared films.

Advancing and receding water
contact angles were measured on both
sides of approximately 5 μL drops with the syringe in the probe
droplet during measurements on the thin film surface, using a Ramé-Hart
manual contact angle goniometer with a microliter syringe. The reported
values and ranges represent the averages and standard deviations from
three measurements per sample of at least three independently prepared
samples.

Ion transport in the thin films was determined by performing
EIS.
An electrochemical cell was constructed consisting of the gold-coated
silicon substrate coated with the film to be studied as the working
electrode, a gold-coated silicon substrate as the counter electrode,
a Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M) reference electrode, and a 0.1 M aqueous solution
of the film anion potassium salts as the electrolyte. To limit the
testing area to 1 cm2 of each sample, a sample holder of
a Flat Cell (Princeton Applied Research, model K0235) was utilized.
The spectra were acquired using a Gamry Instruments Reference 600
potentiostat interfaced to a personal computer. The electrochemical
cell was perturbed with a 5 mV rms ac voltage applied at the open
circuit potential, which was varied in frequency from 105 to 10–2 Hz using 10 points per decade. The two-time-constant
equivalent circuit model consisting of a solution resistance (Rs), a film capacitance (Cf) and resistance (Rf), and an
interfacial capacitance (Ci) and resistance
(Ri) shown in Scheme 1 was used to fit the spectra using the Gamry
EChem Analyst software package.

4 Conclusions
Random coPIL films were prepared by the simple anion exchange of
p[N1-dMIm] films with aqueous solutions consisting of PF6– anions and either ClO4– or FSI– anions. These films exhibit
a thermodynamically determined selectivity, with PF6– anions more selective for the film compared to ClO4– anions, but less selective than FSI– anions. The surface wettability for p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] films shows that the concentration
of the ClO4– anion on the surface is
higher than that in the bulk. The film resistance (Rf) to ion conduction for p[N1-dMIm][PF6][ClO4] films is linearly dependent on the binary
anion mole fraction of PF6– in solution
(xPF6–) as
the Rf of the ClO4– anion is too small to be measured. This trend in Rf is consistent with the much greater thermodynamic tendency
for PF6– to occupy sites in the film.
In this way, a key characteristic of the film, Rf, can be continuously tuned between the extremes of the two
homopolymers by simply changing the film ionic environment. The ability
to easily form random coPIL films that exhibit a continuum of tuned
properties between those of the homopolymers greatly increases the
utility of PIL films.
