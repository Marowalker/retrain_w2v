The
dodecavanadate framework, [V12O32]4–, exhibits a unique bowl-type structure with an open molecular oxide
cage having a cavity diameter of 4.4 Å, and different synthetic
paths were required to construct the bowl-type structure with a different
guest. A new dodecavanadate, {(n-C4H9)4N}4[V12O32(CH3NO2)] (1), is synthesized with a nitromethane
guest, which is stacked above the entrance of the hemisphere rather
than fully occupying the cavity, and it enables a guest-capturing
reaction, while retaining the anionic cage structure. Compound 1 is a good precursor for halide-centered dodecavanadates,
{(C2H5)4N}5[V12O32(X)] (X = Cl– (2), Br– (3), and I– (4)). The position of the halide inside the cavity correlates
with the ionic radius of the guest; the small chloride ion sat at
the far bottom, and the large iodide floated at the entrance. The
inclusion reaction rates were estimated through 51V NMR
time-course measurements in nitromethane. The reaction rates increase
in the order I– < Br– <
Cl–.

Introduction
Anion receptor chemistry
is applicable in a large variety of fields,
such as biological, environmental, medicinal, and materials chemistry.1 Until now, a number of artificial anion receptors
with high affinity and/or selectivity have been reported. Anions can
be recognized by several binding interactions, such as electrostatic
interactions, hydrogen-bonding interactions between anions and NH
or CH groups, anion−π interactions, and Lewis acid–anion
interactions. Among anion receptors, a halide receptor is one of the
important research topics because it can act as sensitive on/off switches
for functional materials as well as biological functioning.2 The design of receptors for the simplest anion
is difficult because of its spherical symmetry. For the development
of a halide receptor, a clever design of the binding site is necessary
to accommodate a halide guest, and the host has to provide a highly
symmetric spherical cavity with the right size for the halide ion.

In general, anion receptors have positive or neutral charges on
their host frameworks.2 Although vanadium–oxygen
clusters possess a high negative charge, they act as hosts that can
stabilize an anion guest through electrostatic interaction with positively
charged vanadium ions.4 Anionic metal–oxygen
clusters of highly oxidized early transition metals, such as vanadium,
molybdenum, and tungsten, are the so-called polyoxometalates.3 They are employed in a wide range of fields of
science, such as analytical chemistry, medicinal chemistry, electrochemistry,
photochemistry, and catalyst chemistry.3 Although there are many structures of polyoxometalates, typical
anions such as F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, CN–, CO32–, NO–, NO2–, NO3–, N3–, HS–, SCN–, HCO2–, and CH3CO2– are only stabilized in vanadium-based polyoxometalates
(polyoxovanadates), showing structural versatility.4 The geometrical shape of the anions governs the resulting
cluster structures through the template reaction. Without anion templates,
the unique frameworks of polyoxovanadates are not formed.

From
these spherical structures, the encapsulated anions are unable
to dissociate freely due to the closed-cage structures. The guest
anions should be able to dissociate from or associate with the cavity
for an application through an open site in the spheres. Such
polyoxovanadates have the potential to act as an inorganic host molecule
that may exhibit properties required for applications such as molecular
recognition, ion separation, or molecular switching.1,5 A bowl-type dodecavanadate, [V12O32]4–, was first reported by Yaghi et al.6 This
framework possesses a 4.4 Å cavity entrance surrounded by eight
oxygen atoms in the same plane in the optimized structure. The bowl
structure is constructed from two parts, which are the bottom of four
corner-shared VO5 units and the rim of eight edge-shared
VO5 units. The line connecting the centroids of eight vanadium
atoms at the rim and of four vanadium atoms at the bottom is a quasi-four-fold
axis. After the first report, two types of dodecavanadates with Cl– or NO– guests were synthesized by
quite different procedures.7,8 The nitric oxide anion-centered
dodecavanadate was synthesized from [VO3]− and NO gas.8 The chloride-centered dodecavanadate,
[V12O32(Cl)]5– (2), was synthesized from a cyclic octavanadate, [Cu2V8O24]4–.7 The removal of Cu2+ ions from the cluster liberates the
V8 cyclic ring that is in close proximity to the rim part
of the dodecavanadate cage, and spontaneous condensation leads to
the formation of 2.7 We also
developed the structure transformation reaction of a chloride-centered
dodecavanadate, which changes from a bowl shape to a ball shape by
the addition of acid or base.9

The
computational approach by Bénard et al. revealed the
presence of a unique attractive electrostatic interaction between
the inside of the dodecavanadate bowl and the nitrile group.10 This interaction is strong and the previous
guest-exchange reaction was limited among nitrile derivatives.11 An acetonitrile-containing
complex, [V12O32(CH3CN)]4–, is the dominant species formed in acetonitrile. The presence of
excess acetonitrile as a solvent prevented the exchange of bounded
acetonitrile for halides. Our
strategy for the systematic halide incorporation reaction into the
anionic bowl-type dodecavanadate and for the elucidation of the host
property consists in avoiding the use of a nitrile group during the
reaction and finding a good precursor that can be easily exchanged
for a guest. We
seek a guest that forms a weak interaction with the cavity because
of steric bulkiness, and nitromethane is suited for this purpose due
to its triangular shape that is difficult to fit in the circular cavity
and the fact that it is a good solvent for dodecavanadate. In this
article, the unique host properties of the dodecavanadate framework
as a halide receptor were investigated. Each guest-containing dodecavanadate
was isolated and fully characterized. The halide incorporation reaction
rates are also discussed.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structures
of Guest-Exchangeable Bowl-Type Dodecavanadate
The guest-exchangeable
dodecavanadate, {(n-C4H9)4N}4[V12O32(CH3NO2)] (1), was synthesized
by an oxidation reaction of a reduced polyoxovanadate, [V10O26]4–, in nitromethane. Addition of t-BuOOH as an oxidant to a [V10O26]4– solution gave a reddish brown solution.12 The UV–vis spectrum of the isolated product
showed no absorption bands above 600 nm, suggesting that all of the
vanadium species are oxidized to V5+. The IR spectrum showed
the same pattern as that of the cage-type dodecavanadate framework
with additional peaks from nitromethane. Single crystals suitable
for the X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained from a mixed
solvent of nitromethane and diethyl ether (1:2, v/v, Figure 1). One nitromethane exists
on top of the dodecavanadate cavity, and only one oxygen atom from
nitromethane is barely incorporated at the entrance of the cavity.
The deviation of the principal axis of nitromethane from the equatorial
plane defined by the eight entrance oxygen atoms of dodecavanadate
is ca. 60°. The size of the nitrogroup prohibits complete insertion
of the nitromethane molecule into the cavity because the size with
respect to the interatomic distance of two oxygen atoms (4.9 Å)
is larger than the entrance of the dodecavanadate framework (4.4 Å).
The electrostatic balance between
attractive and repulsive forces affects the tilting angles of nitromethane
on the cavity. Whereas
one oxygen atom of the nitrogroup sits at the same level as the vanadium
plane at the rim (attractive interaction with positively charged vanadium
ions), the other sits at the same level as the entrance of the oxygen
plane (repulsive interaction with negative oxygens). The acetonitrile
guest can be easily inserted into the cavity due to its linear structure
with no steric bulkiness, and in fact, when compound 1 is dissolved in acetonitrile solvent, {(n-C4H9)4N}4[V12O32(CH3CN)] is obtained in 92% yield based on vanadium.6 In addition, dissolution of 1 in
1,2-dichloroethane gives {(n-C4H9)4N}4[V12O32(C2H4Cl2)] (5) in 85% yield (Figure 1), and this demonstrates
the guest-capturing capability of 1. Acetonitrile and
1,2-dichloroethane guests are vertically positioned so as to orient
a polar functional group to the cavity. Whereas a nitrogen atom of
acetonitrile locates at a depth of 1.58 Å from the entrance oxygen
atom plane, a chlorine atom in 5 sits at a depth of 0.85
Å.6 The weak polarity and steric hindrance
of the alkyl group prevented the insertion of 1,2-dichloroethane into
the cavity.

a deviation of ca. 60° from the equatorial plane. Orange, red,
blue, black, and green spheres represent the vanadium, oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon, and chlorine atoms, respectively.

Halide Incorporation Reaction into the Dodecavanadate Framework
Compound 1 can effectively behave as a guest-exchangeable
bowl molecule, and it is proved to be a good starting material for
the synthesis of different halide-centered dodecavanadate compounds.
The halide-centered compounds, {(C2H5)4N}5[V12O32(X)] (X = Cl– (2), Br– (3), and I– (4)), were obtained simply by addition
of tetraethlyammonium halide in nitromethane. Under the same reaction
conditions, a fluoride-centered bowl molecule was not isolated. The
yields of 2–4 were over 90% based
on vanadium. Anion-containing polyoxovanadates are usually formed
by the self-condensation of vanadium–oxygen species around
the template anions.4 This is the first
report on the post-incorporation of anion guests into preassembled
polyoxovanadate frameworks.

An inorganic dodecavanadate host
shows unique size selectivity. The sizes of chloride (3.3 Å),
bromide (3.6 Å), and iodide (4.1 Å) are smaller than the
entrance hole of the dodeavanadate framework (4.4 Å). The larger
ion, BF4– (4.6 Å), is unable to
penetrate into the framework even with the addition of 30 equiv of
{(n-C4H9)4N}BF4 in nitromethane, showing only signals due to 1 in 51V NMR.13 In addition,
we tried to utilize the open-cage structure by testing whether outside
reagents can interact with the guest at the center. The reaction with
silver cations allows the interaction with halides at the center through
the open cavity, and the guest is successfully removed as silver salts
in nitromethane solution. The three characteristic 51V
NMR peaks from the bowl-type framework are observed in all complexes,
showing the retention of the cage structure after the guest removal
(Figure S1).

The crystallographic
data for 2–4 are collectively shown
in Table S1. Compound 2 has
already been reported using a different synthetic path,
but the improved synthetic method is described in this article.7 The structures of 2–4 are isomorphous to each other and consist of a dodecavanadate
bowl with a halide guest at the center of the cavity (Table 1). The overall structures of
the dodecavanadate frameworks are similar to each other. No direct
bonds between the guest and the cluster cage are observed. The shortest
V···X distances are 3.10, 3.32, and 3.47 Å for
chloride, bromine, and iodide, respectively, and these values are
larger than the sums of the ionic radii of the halide and vanadium
ions, suggesting that these anions are stabilized by the electrostatic
interaction without direct bonds. In spite of different halide radii,
the average distances between the halide ion and eight rim vanadium
atoms are in a similar range (3.75 Å for 2, 3.73
Å for 3, and 3.72 Å for 4).

radii (Table 2). The
average distances between the halide ion and four vanadium atoms at
the bottom are 3.16, 3.34, and 3.49 Å, respectively. This value
for chloride is larger than those in the previously reported polyoxovanadates
with the similar opened [V4O8] units to that
of 2 (3.00 Å in [V12P20(H2O)12(Ph2CHPO3)8(Cl)2]2– and 2.85 Å in [V4O8(CH3CO2)4(Cl)]–).14

51V NMR Spectroscopic
Studies
To examine
the host–guest interaction, 51V NMR spectra of 1–5 were recorded at 25 °C, and they
are shown in Figure 2. 51V NMR spectrum of 1 shows three peaks
at −591, −596, and −605 ppm with an integration
ratio of 1:1:1. The peak at −591 ppm in 1 is assigned
to vanadium atoms at the bottom.15 The
peaks at −596 and −605 ppm are assigned to vanadium
atoms at the rim. The eight rim vanadium atoms can be divided into
two groups according to their environments; one is connected to two
bottom vanadium atoms through the corner-shared oxygen atom, and the
other is connected to one bottom vanadium atom through edge-shared
oxygen atoms. Inclusion
of the halide guests led to chemical shifts to lower fields. The lowest
field peak of 4 has a shoulder, and this indicates that
the two lower field peaks overlap with each other. Although the size
of the halide ions varies from 3.3 Å for chloride to 4.1 Å
for iodide, the diameter of the rim ring and the average distances
between the halide ion and vanadium atoms are comparable, and the
signals due to the vanadium atoms of the rim are shifted downfield
with an increase in the anion radius of the halide ion. It is known
that the differences in NMR chemical shifts of endohedral rigid cage
frameworks such as fullerene reflect the radii of the encapsulated
species.16 On the other hand, at the bottom,
increasing the radius increases the V···X distances,
and the signal due to the vanadium atoms of the bottom is shifted
upfield with the increase in the anion radius of the halide ion. Thus, 51V NMR chemical shifts essentially depend on the charge density
of the halide ions, rather than on the vanadium–halide distance
or on the radii of the halide ions.

Figure 2 51V NMR spectra of 1–4measured
in nitromethane and of 5 measured in 1,2-dichloroethane.

The halide guests remain trapped
even at 70 °C in nitromethane
solution. By increasing the temperature, the peaks of 2–4 shifted to lower fields, but otherwise, the
spectra remained the same (Figure S2).
The spectra simply retrieve the original lines on cooling to room
temperature, without any sign of decomposition. Importantly, the dissociation
reaction of halide was not observed during our investigation, suggesting
that the halide incorporation is a one-way reaction.

Kinetic Study
by 51V NMR Spectroscopy
To
examine the guest incorporation property, a time course of 51V NMR spectra was collected after the addition of a halide ion to
a nitromethane solution of 1. To compare the simple incorporation
reaction rates of each halide ion, the reaction was carried out in
the presence of 30 equiv of halide. After the addition of halide,
the peak intensity due to 1 decreases and that due to
the corresponding halide-centered dodecavanadate 2–4 increases with time (Figure 3). No other peaks were detected during the reaction.
On the basis of the observation, a simple reaction path for the guest
incorporation reaction of 1 was proposed as follows.  The
halide incorporation reactions to form 2–4 completed in 120, 2100, and 6300 s,
respectively (Figure S3). From the kinetic
plots, the rates for the chloride, bromide, and iodide inclusion reactions
based on 51V NMR measurements were 2.7 × 10–2, 2.0 × 10–3, and 8.8 × 10–4 s–1, respectively (Figure 3). The rates decreased with increasing anion
radius due to its increasing steric hindrance. The incorporation reactions
of chloride, bromide, and iodide were carried out at different temperatures.
The reaction rates at −10, 0, and 10 °C were 1.8 ×
10–2, 2.7 × 10–2, and 4.9
× 10–2 for chloride, 1.1 × 10–3, 2.0 × 10–3, and 3.4 × 10–3 for bromide, and 3.0 × 10–4, 8.8 × 10–4, and 2.8 × 10–3 for iodide,
respectively. From the Arrhenius equation, the activation energies
for the respective incorporation reaction of chloride, bromide, and
iodide were estimated to be 30, 35, and 69 kJ/mol, respectively (Figure S4).

and 4 (orange). [1]0 represents
the initial concentration of 1.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculation
To compare
the affinity of the central halide to the dodecavanadate framework,
DFT calculation was performed. The geometries of the vacant dodecavanadate
host were optimized using the anion structure of 5 without
1,2-dichloroethane as the starting model. The energies of the host–guest
systems were calculated by placing the guest anion at several different
positions on the line connecting the centroids of the eight vanadium
atoms at the rim and four vanadium atoms at the bottom. The results
are plotted as a function of the distance of the guest anion from
the plane of the entrance oxygen atoms in Figure S5. The figure clearly shows the energy minima for all chloride,
bromide, and iodide ions at 1.61, 1.40, and 1.08 Å, respectively.
These values are comparable to those observed in the crystal structures. Figure S5 also shows the energy maxima. The energy
gap value between the minima and the maxima is the largest for chloride
(103 kJ mol–1) and smallest for iodide (42 kJ mol–1). The gap for bromide is 78 kJ mol–1. These values are large enough to trap the halide guests inside
once it enters the cavity of the dodecavanadate bowl even at 70 °C
in nitromethane solution.

Conclusions
A
bowl-type dodecavanadate with nitromethane as a packing molecule
was synthesized and characterized. By dissolution of the nitromethane-containing
dodecavanadate into a polar solvent, the guest-exchange reaction proceeds
to form a solvent-containing dodecavanadate, retaining the bowl structure.
The bowl-type dodecavanadate framework shows a unique halide receptor
property. Three kinds of halides were stabilized in the cavity of
the bowl by addition of halide salts to the dodecavanadate solution.
The guest halide positions in the cavity are related to the halide
sizes, and the chloride ion was the most deeply incorporated one inside
the cage. The incorporation reaction rate for each halide ion was
estimated from 51V NMR measurements in nitromethane. The
rates decrease with increasing anion radius. The Arrhenius analysis
and DFT calculations confirm that the small chloride ion is incorporated
more easily into the cavity by overcoming the negative–negative
repulsion between X···O at the entrance of the
cavity, and once it is incorporated, it is more difficult to dissociate
it due to the electrostatic interaction between X···V
from the unique polyoxovanadate framework. The bowl-type polyoxovanadate
host and the halide guest possess anionic charge. Nevertheless, the
bowl acts as an effective halide receptor, and it captures a halide
without dissociation, even if it is an open cavity.

X-ray Crystallography
Single-crystal structure analyses
of 2–5 were performed using a Rigku/MSC
Mercury diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71070 Å) and with 0.5° ω-scans at 0 and
90° in ϕ. Details of data collection and structure refinement,
including the final cell constants, are listed in Table S1. Data were collected and processed using the CrystalClear
program (Rigaku)
(Supporting Information). Absorption corrections
were applied on the basis of face indexing. The structures were solved
by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares using the
SHELX-97 and SHELX2013 program suite.17 The program PLATON was used to evaluate the accuracy of the refinements,
space group choice, and the lack of higher symmetry.18

Kinetic Studies
A nitromethane solution
of {(n-C4H9)4N}X
(X = Cl–, Br–, I–; 1.2
M, 0.25 mL) was mixed with a nitromethane solution of 1 (0.04 M, 0.25 mL) in an NMR tube at −20 °C. 51V NMR spectral change was measured at −10, 0, and 10 °C.

Calculation Methods
All calculations were performed
using the ADF program package.19 The basis
functions consisted of a triple-ζ basis set with polarization
functions from the ADF basis-set library (TZP). The core–shells
up to 1s for O, 2p for Cl, 3p for V, 4p for Br, and 4d for I were
kept frozen. The geometries of the dodecavanadate host were fixed
to those of the optimized host during the calculations.
