The electroreductive coupling of 1-alkoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones

adducts reacted at the 2-position of 4-quinolones as trimethylsilyl
ethers. The adducts were transformed to 2-(diarylhydroxymethyl)-4-quinolones.

Introduction
4-Quinolone ring has been found in many
biologically active compounds1 and, in
particular, is the core skeleton of the
quinolone antibiotics (Figure 1).2 Therefore, the synthesis of
4-quinolone derivatives has extensively been studied.3 On the other hand, we have reported the electroreductive
cross-coupling of heterocycles, such as phthalimides,4 indoles,5 uracils,6 coumarins,7 and chromones8 with carbonyl compounds. In this context, we
attempted the electroreductive cross-coupling of 4-quinolones with
carbonyl compounds since this reaction is expected to provide a new
synthetic route to 2-subsutituted 4-quinolones.9 As far as we know, the reductive cross-coupling of 4-quinolones
with carbonyl compounds is hitherto unknown.10 In this paper, we report the cross-coupling of 1-alkoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones
with benzophenones by the electroreduction in the presence of trimethylsilyl
chloride (TMSCl) (Scheme 1). The coupled products reacted at the 2-position of 4-quinolones
were obtained as trimethylsilyl ethers and transformed to 2-diarylhydroxymethyl-4-quinolones
in three steps. The electroreduction of 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones
with benzophenones also gave the coupled products reacted at the 2-position
of 4-quinolones, while the same reactions of 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-8-methoxy-4-quinolones
produced the coupled products reacted at the 4-position (Scheme 2). Such a difference
of the reacting sites in 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones can be
explained by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) coefficients for these 4-quinolones.
Furthermore, the electroreduction of polyhalogenated 3-alkoxycarbonyl-1-alkyl-4-quinolones
with benzophenones and subsequent treatment with trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) gave γ-lactones as the coupled products reacted at the
2-position of 4-quinolones (Scheme 3). The γ-lactones could readily be dehydrogenated
with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ). The reaction
mechanism of the electroreductive coupling was also discussed.

Results and Discussion
Electroreductive Coupling of 1-Alkoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones with
Benzophenones
First, the electroreduction of 1-methyl-4-quinolone
(1a) with benzophenone (2a) (2 equiv) in
tetrahydrofuran (THF) containing TMSCl (5 equiv) was carried out (2
F/mol for 2a) according to our already reported method4−8 (Scheme 4). The product
coupled at the 2-position of 1a with 2a was
obtained as a trimethylsilyl ether 3a in 31% yield and
more than 50% of unreacted 1a was recovered. In addition,
the product 3a readily returned to the starting materials 1a and 2a by treatment with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) or 1 M HCl due to fast oxidative cleavage
of the desilylated alcohol 4a by air. Based on these
results, 1-methoxycarbonyl(Moc)-4-quinolone (1b) was
employed in place of 1a to improve the reactivity of
the 4-quinolones as an acceptor and the stability of the desilylated
alcohols to oxidative cleavage. Expectedly, the corresponding coupled
product 3b was obtained by the reaction of 1b with 2a in 69% yield, as shown in Table 1 (run 1). The reaction of other
benzophenones 2b–f with 1b afforded the coupled products 3c–g in moderate to good yields (runs 2–6). It was found that
benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)
groups were also effective as activating and protecting groups for
4-quinolones (runs 7–9).

a Electroreduction of 1b–d (1 mmol) and 2a–f (2 mmol) was carried out in 0.3 M Bu4ClO4/THF in the presence of TMSCl (5 mmol) using a Pt cathode
at a constant current of 0.2 A (400 C).

Next, the treatment of 3b–j with
TBAF in THF at 25 °C for 10 min gave cyclic carbamates 5a–f by desilylation and following cyclization
to 2-oxazolidinones (Table 2). The electroreduction of 1-Moc-3-methyl-4-quinolone (1e) with 2a under the same conditions gave the
product 3k as a single stereoisomer (>99% selectivity
by 1H NMR analysis), although the yield was relatively
low (36%) (Scheme 5). The stereostructure of 3k was confirmed to be cis
by X-ray crystallographic analysis, and this complete cis-selective
formation of 3k was in accordance with our previously
reported results for the electroreductive coupling of other heterocycles
with 2a.5−8 The desilylation of cis-3k with TBAF
produced cyclic carbamate 5g as a diastereomeric mixture
(cis/trans = 25:75) due to the isomerization of cis-5g to trans-5g.

In contrast to 4a (Scheme 4), desilylated alcohol 4b was
obtained as a stable solid in 95% yield by the treatment of 3b with 1 M HCl and dioxane (1:1) at 50 °C for 6 h (Scheme 6). Unfortunately,
acid-catalyzed detrimethylsiloxylation of 3b and dehydration
of 4b did not give 2-diphenylmethyl-4-quinolone 6 but the cyclic carbamate 5a. Incidentally, 4b was treated with NaH in THF to give 5a. Although
the efforts to obtain 6 from 3b and 4b resulted in failure, 2-diarylmethyl-4-quinolones 7a and 7b were prepared from N-Cbz-protected 3h and 3i (Scheme 7). The N- and O-deprotections
of 3h and 3i proceeded by treatment with
HCO2H/EtOH in the presence of Pd/C at 50 °C for 12
h. The formylation of resultant ammonium salts i with
Ac2O/HCO2H at 50 °C for 4 h and following
treatment of formamides ii in refluxing toluene in the
presence of cat. PPTS for 2 h gave 7a and 7b in 25 and 46% total yields, respectively. In the last step, it seems
that the dehydration of the β-formamide alcohols ii and subsequent deformylation of 1-formyl-4-quinolones iii took place successively. On the other hand, dehydrogenetion of 5a, 5b, and 5f with DDQ in refluxing
dioxane for 3 h afforded 4-quinolones 8a–c in high yields (Table 3). The N,O-deprotection of 8a–c was effected by the treatment with MeONa/MeOH at 25 °C
for 1 h to give 2-diarylhydroxymethyl-4-quinolones 9a–c.

Electroreductive Coupling of 1,3-Diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones
with Benzophenones
The electroreduction of 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolone
(1f) with 2a was carried out under the same
conditions as described in Table 1. Although the coupled product reacted at the 2-position
of 1f was obtained as a trimethylsilyl ether, it could
not be purified. Therefore, the product was isolated as desilylated
alcohol 10a in 63% yield after the treatment of the crude
product with 1 M HCl in EtOH at 25 °C for 1 h (Table 4, run 1). The product 10a was found to almost exist as an enol form from the 1H and 13C NMR spectra and X-ray analysis. Other
products 10b–e were similarly obtained
by the reaction of 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones 1f–h with 2a and 2b in
moderate to good yields (runs 2–5).

Although the obtained 10a and 10b were
readily converted to cyclic carbamates 11a and 11b by the treatment with NaH/THF, the dehydrogenation of 11a and 11b with DDQ/dioxane was very slow (48
h) and brought about 4-quinolones 12a and 12b only in poor yields (Scheme 8). Incidentally, 11a and 11b were
obtained as single isomers and the stereostructure of 11a was undoubtedly confirmed to be trans of the keto form by its X-ray
analysis.

Scheme 8 Cyclization and Subsequent Dehydrogenation of 11a and 11b
In contrast, the electroreduction of 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-8-methoxy-4-quinolone
(1i) with 2a under the same conditions produced
quinoline 13a (55% yield) as the product coupled at the
4-position of 1i and the product coupled at the 2-position
of 1i could not be obtained (Table 5, run 1). In addition, 5,8- and 6,8-dimethoxy-substituted
1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones (1j and 1k) also gave 4-substituted quinolines 13b and 13c by the reaction with 2a, although the yields of 13b and 13c were somewhat low (runs 2 and 3).
The desilylation of 13a–c with TBAF-afforded
γ-lactones 14a–c (Table 6). The chemical structure
of 14a was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.

Electroreductive Coupling of 3-Alkoxycarbonyl-1-alkyl-4-quinolones
with Benzophenones
The electroreduction of 3-ethoxycarbonyl-1-methyl-4-quinolone
(1l) with 2a was carried out under the same
conditions as described in Table 1 (Table 7, run 1). The coupled product iv was formed, even though
the yield was low (<25% by 1H NMR analysis of the crude
product). Since the product iv could not be purified,
the crude product was desilylated. However, the desilylation of the
crude product of iv with TBAF or TFA/CH2Cl2 resulted in the oxidative cleavage of desilylated β-amino
alcohol v to 1l and 2a in a
similar manner to that described in Scheme 4. These miserable results were probably due
to the low reactivity of 1l as an acceptor and the high
lability of β-amino alcohol v to the oxidative
cleavage by air. On the other hand, it is expected that commercially
available polyhalogenated 3-alkoxycarbonyl-1-alkyl-4-quinolones 1m and 1n have high reactivity as an acceptor
and, in addition, their desilylated β-amino alcohols v have high oxidation resistance owing to the electron-withdrawing
halogen substituents. Actually, the electroreduction of 1m and 1n with 2a and 2b and
subsequent treatment of the crude products iv with TFA/CH2Cl2 at 25 °C for 12 h gave γ-lactones 15b–d (Table 7, runs 2–4). The labile β-amino
alcohols v are stabilized by the transformation to the
stable γ-lactones 15b–d in
the acidic conditions. The dehydrogenation of 15b–d with DDQ immediately proceeded (25 °C, 1 h) to give
the corresponding 4-quinolones 16b–d (Table 8).

Reaction Mechanism of the Electroreductive Coupling 4-Quinolones
with Benzophenones
We measured the cyclic voltammetry (CV)
of 4-quinolones 1 under the same conditions as already
reported CV of benzophenones 2, and these data of first
reduction peaks (Ep) are summarized in Table 9. These results show
that 2 are generally more reducible than 1, although the differences of Ep values
between 1-alkoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones 1b–k, 1m, 1n and 2a–e are relatively small. From these results of CV data and
our previously reported results of the reductive coupling of other
heterocycles with 2,5−8 the reaction mechanism of the electroreductive
coupling of 1 (except for 1i–k) with 2 can be presumed as illustrated in Scheme 9. Initially, carbanion A is generated by the two-electron transfer to 2 and O-silylation with TMSCl. The nucleophilic 1,4-addition of A to the 2-position of 1 and the following O-silylation
of resultant enolate anion B produce trimethylsilyl enol
ether C. The labile C is readily desilylated
to 3 (10′, iv) during
workup. Unreacted carbanion A is protonated to give benzhydrol
trimethylsilyl ether (vi).

On the contrary, the nucleophilic addition of A occurs
at the 4-position of 8-methoxy-substituted 1 (1i–k) and subsequent O-silylation of anion D give trimethylsilyl ether E (Scheme 10). The labile E undergoes rapid aromatization to quinolinium ion F and
the following deethoxycarbonylation of F during workup
to yield quinoline 13. To elucidate the different reactivity
as an acceptor to A between 8-unsubstituted 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones 1f–h and 8-methoxy substituted ones 1i–k, we calculated the LUMO coefficients
and Mulliken charges at the 2 and 4 C carbons of 1f–k at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level. As summarized in Table 10, the LUMO coefficients
at 2 C are much larger than those at 4 C in 1f–h, while the reverse results are shown in 1i and 1j. Although the LUMO coefficient at 2 C is slightly larger
than that at 4 C in 1k, the calculation results practically
well explain the difference of the reaction sites to A between 1f–h and 1i–k. It is presumed the reaction site of 1k is determined by more plus charge at 4 C than at 2 C since
the difference of the LUMO coefficients between 2 and 4 C is small.

Conclusions
The electroreductive intermolecular coupling
of 1-alkoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones 1b–e with benzophenones 2a–f in the
presence of TMSCl in THF gave the adducts
reacted at the 2-position of 1b–e as tetramethylsilane (TMS) ethers 3b–k. The detrimethylsilylation of 3b–k with TBAF in THF afforded cyclic carbamates 5a–g. The TMS ethers 3h and 3i (1-Cbz)
were transformed to 2-diarylmethyl-4-quinolones 7a and 7b by hydrogenation, formylation, and dehydration. The cyclic
carbamates 5a, 5b, and 5f were
transformed to 2-diarylhydroxymethyl-4-quinolones 9a–c by dehydration with DDQ and the following deprotection of
the resultant 8a–c with MeONa/MeOH.
The electroreductive coupling of 1,3-diethoxycarbonyl-4-quinolones 1f–h with 2a and 2b and subsequent treatment with 1 M HCl/EtOH produced the coupled
products 10a–e reacted at the 2-position
of 1f–h. In contrast, the electroreductive
coupling of 1,3-diethooxycarbonyl-8-methoxy-4-quinolones 1i–k with 2a occurred at the 4-position
of 1i–k to give 4-substituted quinolines 13a–c. The electroreduction of polyhalogenated
3-alkoxycarbonyl-1-alkyl-4-quinolones 1m and 1n with 2a and 2b gave the adducts reacted
at the 2-position of 1m and 1n, and subsequent
treatment of the adducts with TFA/CH2Cl2 afforded
γ-lactones 15b–d. The treatment
of 15b–d with DDQ gave dehydrogenated
4-quinolones 16b–d.

Typical Procedure of Electroreductive Coupling
A 0.3
M solution of Bu4NClO4 in THF (15 mL) was placed
in a cathodic chamber of a divided cell (40 mL beaker, 3 cm diameter,
6 cm height) equipped with a platinum cathode (5 × 5 cm2), a platinum anode (2 × 1 cm2), and a ceramic cylindrical
diaphragm (1.5 cm diameter). A 0.3 M solution of Et4NOTs
in DMF (4 mL) was placed in an anodic chamber (inside the diaphragm).
1-Methoxycarbonyl-4-quinolone (1b) (203 mg, 1.0 mmol),
benzophenone (2a) (368 mg, 2.0 mmol), TMSCl (0.64 mL,
5.0 mmol), and TEA (0.70 mL, 5.0 mmol) were added to the cathodic
chamber. After 400 C of electricity (2 F/mol for 2a)
was passed at a constant current of 200 mA at 25 °C under nitrogen
atmosphere, the catholyte was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was
dissolved in diethyl ether (20 mL) and insoluble solid was filtered
off. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, the residue was purified
by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane–EtOAc) to give 3b (317 mg) in 69% yield.
