Magnetic separation
is a promising alternative to conventional
methods in downstream processing. This can facilitate easier handling,
fewer processing steps, and more sustainable processes. Target materials
can be extracted directly from crude cell lysates in a single step
by magnetic nanoadsorbents with high-gradient magnetic fishing (HGMF).
Additionally, the use of hazardous consumables for reducing downstream
processing steps can be avoided. Here, we present proof of principle
of one-step magnetic fishing from crude Escherichia
coli cell lysate of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)
with an attached hexahistidine (His6)-tag, which is used
as the model target molecule. The focus of this investigation is the
upscale to a liter scale magnetic fishing process in which a purity
of 91% GFP can be achieved in a single purification step from cleared
cell lysate. The binding through the His6-tag can be demonstrated,
since no significant binding of nontagged GFP toward bare iron oxide
nanoparticles (BIONs) can be observed. Nonfunctionalized BIONs with
primary particle diameters of around 12 nm, as used in the process,
can be produced with a simple and low-cost coprecipitation synthesis.
Thus, HGMF with BIONs might pave the way for a new and greener era
of downstream processing.

Introduction
In nature, multifarious
interactions between biomolecules and inorganic
surfaces occur, ranging from the adhesion of organisms under the sea
to the growth of bones and teeth in vertebrates. The control of these
interactions can be utilized to implement applications in nanomedicine
for implant coatings,1 drug delivery,2 or magnetic resonance imaging.3,4 Furthermore,
with the help of a fundamental understanding of the interaction, new
application fields emerge, ranging from biosensing,5,6 (bio-)catalysis,7,87,8 and power storage to wastewater treatment and toxicology,9 as well as purification of therapeutic proteins.10,11 To investigate these biointerfacial phenomena, the binding processes,
parameters influencing the interactions, and protein organization
at the surface need to be characterized thoroughly.12 There are multiple possibilities to study, interpret, and
apply interactions at bio–nano interfaces.13−15 The main issue
for all approaches is the interplay of many different forces and components
in complex biological fluids, which control the interactions between
biomolecules and nanomaterials. In complex fluids, the components
(from small molecules to large proteins) define the surface of nanoparticles.
This dynamic concept is called corona formation, and it occurs immediately
in biological media.16,17 Biomolecules are loosely bound
to the surface and the composition is determined by biomolecules’
incidence and affinity.18−20 Particularly, superparamagnetic
nanoparticles are of great interest, as their magnetic properties
facilitate transport and magnetic sensing of biomolecules as well
as magnetically induced heating.21,22 Thus, many
applications, especially in the medical sector, emerge from these
magnetic nanomaterials.23 However, their
properties can be used in biotechnology,24−28 catalysis,7,29 and data storage.30 One approach to control the interaction of magnetic
nanoparticles with biomolecules is the tailoring of the particle surface
by different modifications and functionalization methods.21,22,26,31,32 This particle tuning not only affects the
aqueous interface, and therefore the interaction with biomolecules,
but also changes the stability of particles in suspension and thus
the mechanical properties. Consequently, controlling the surface properties
presents the greatest challenge in nanotechnology as not only surface
modifications but also the buffer composition as well as detergents
and biomolecules in complex media determine the identity of nanoparticles.33−35

Another aspect, which is difficult to control, is the agglomeration
behavior of nanoparticles when exposed to biomolecules in complex
media.36 However, the agglomeration strongly
affects the hydrodynamic properties and, accordingly, the ability
to process magnetic nanoparticle fluids mechanically and magnetically.
Low-cost magnetic nanoparticles, usually consisting of magnetite,
maghemite, transition states in between, or mixtures of both materials,
have to be smaller than 20–30 nm to possess superparamagnetic
properties, which facilitate simple handling in separation due to
no remanence at room temperature.37

Even though magnetic separation holds many advantages compared
with standard processes and is already in use for medical applications,
no industrial processes exist to date.8,38

On the
other hand, several approaches to design and build industrially
relevant high-gradient magnetic fishing (HGMF) separators do exist.38,39 The models range from filler materials (such as iron spheres or
steel wool over wires and meshes) to defined matrix structures. However,
especially, the recovery of magnetic nanoparticles and the target
molecules is a critical processing aspect, which can be solved with
different approaches, including two-phase flow, sonication, or movable
matrices such as a rotor–stator set-up.38 For this investigation, a rotor–stator HGMF was
used to achieve an easy and fast redispersion and deagglomeration
of nanoparticles. Generally, especially small iron oxide nanoparticles
tend to aggregate under ambient conditions and at high salt concentrations.40 This effect is always strengthened in fields.
As a result, agglomerations positively affect the hydrodynamic properties
and thus the separation efficiencies, which is used for most applications
of magnetic nanoparticles.21,41 On the other hand,
aggregation lowers the effective surface area of nanoparticles, and
colloidal stability presents a major challenge in HGMF accordingly.

Here, we use completely nonfunctionalized bare iron oxide nanoparticles
(BIONs), which are not very colloidally stable under ambient conditions
without stabilizing molecules within a pH range of 5.5–8.5,
but form large agglomerates at the microscale.42,43 These particles are used as adsorbents for the purification of green
fluorescent protein (GFP) that contains a hexahistidine (His6)-tag commonly used in affinity chromatography downstream processing.
We use the affinity of the histidine side chains, in the tag sequence,
to the nanoscale iron oxide surface, which is composed of iron ions
ligated by hydroxyl groups.25,44 Here, a coordination
to the iron ions and buffer-controlled electrostatic interactions
leads to a preferential adsorption of His-tagged proteins, which can
be magnetically separated. As a further processing step, the proteins
can be released with an elution buffer similar to that used for immobilized
metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC).45 IMAC is a conventional process that is used in industry and on the
lab scale for purification of several proteins. Metal ions are chelated
by ligands that are attached to the chromatography resin.46 Thus, the His-tag interacts with the chelated
ions resulting in a reversible coordination bond. Therefore, this
method can be used for affinity protein purification.46 Some research groups already adapted the IMAC principle
for magnetic separation processes.41,47−50 However, the investigations are based on magnetic microparticles
that are functionalized by linker chelating metal ions.51 Even though the principle of His-tagged protein
separation, presented here, is similar to IMAC, we want to emphasize
that our particles are used as bare nanoparticles without surface
modifications. In our process, the tag interacts with the particle
surface via complexation and electrostatic interactions.52,53 However, the iron ions at the aqueous interface are tightly bound
to the BIONs and therefore do not leach. Consequently, neither expensive
complexation agents nor toxic metal ions are required, since no regeneration
is needed for the process presented here.54 We focused on the upscaling of HGMF for industrially relevant processes
and were able to validate the upscaling with a magnetic separation
pilot plant in the liter scale.

Results and Discussion
The properties of the BIONs synthesized via a coprecipitation synthesis
used for all experiments were reported earlier in an investigation
by our group.55 BIONs demonstrate a sharp
particle size distribution of around 12 nm, which was obtained by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Figure S1). The small size of the nonfunctionalized nanoparticles
leads to a large specific surface area of 89 m2 g–1 and superparamagnetic properties (remanence < 1 emu g–1) with a high saturation magnetization of 83 emu g–1. The amphiphilic nature of the oxide nanoparticles is demonstrated
by the sigmoidal ζ-potential, which is negatively charged above
and positively charged below the isoelectric point at pH 6.57. Furthermore,
the particles can be identified as magnetite from Raman spectroscopy
and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Figures S1 and S2).55

His6-GFP, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), was purified with anion exchange chromatography (AEX)
after cell lysis. AEX was followed by a polishing step with immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and a purity of >99.9% was
achieved
before further use of the His6-GFP (Figures S3, S5 and Table S4).

The adsorption isotherms
of pure His6-GFP and BIONs
are illustrated in Figure 1A. Interestingly, all buffer conditions led to the adsorption
of His6-GFP and a similar binding capacity around 0.25
g g–1 and thus a similar surface coverage of around
40% (Table S6). However, the affinity can
be adjusted by the variation of the buffer. A high affinity, indicated
by a low KD value, can be observed for
acetate (0.01 g L–1), Tris-buffered saline (TBS,
0.01 g L–1), and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris, 0.03 g L–1). Morpholino ethane sulfonic acid
(MES) and phosphate buffers led to a moderate (0.05 g L–1) and low affinity (0.1 g L–1), respectively (Table S6). Besides surface complexation of iron
oxides by phosphate ions, such effects are usually ascribed to changes
in the surface tension of the solvent and the surface by the buffer
ions.34,52,56,57 Another interesting observation is the adsorption
of a reference GFP without a tag, which does not tend to adsorb in
Tris buffer, clearly indicating the contribution to the binding of
the freestanding His6 sequence of the barrel-shaped protein
(Figure 1). The nontagged
protein shows a significantly lower binding capacity (0.07 g g–1) than the His6-tagged species. Therefore,
changes in the buffer composition around BIONs can be used to influence
the binding affinity of His6-tagged proteins, which enables
control of the separation process. The high maximum load of proteins
on the nanoparticles can easily compete with metal ion-immobilized
nanomaterials and chromatography resins.47 Even the affinity of His6-tagged GFP to the BION surface
is in a range similar to that of Ni2+-immobilized materials.41,47,58 Another interesting point in
the interaction of proteins with colloids is the agglomeration behavior.
Uncoated BIONs show a tendency to agglomerate under ambient conditions
in most buffer systems.40,59,60 Even though the nanoparticles form agglomerates of up to 10 μm
(Figure S7), we obtain this high binding
capacity of His6-GFP. This means that proteins are able
to diffuse into the loosely bound agglomerates and bind to single
particles or significantly smaller aggregates. In an earlier study,
we observed a similar behavior of GFP containing a different tag binding
to BIONs with small-angle neutron scattering.61 Hence, these agglomerations provide the advantages of nano- and
microparticles. This behavior is also visible in the different results
from differential centrifugal sedimentation and optical centrifugation
with hydrodynamic diameters below 100 nm compared with larger agglomerates,
which can be observed by dynamic light scattering (Figure S7). Although these particles demonstrate the high
specific surface area of small nanoparticles, their hydrodynamic properties
are similar to those of large microparticles, leading to a fast separation
in a high-gradient magnetic fishing process.38,39,51,61 The binding
capacity of His6-GFP is furthermore not significantly affected
by the presence of complex media such as the lysate from the E. coli fermentation broth (Figure 1B). The high affinity of His6-GFP
to the BION surface is still very high for cleared cell lysate where
the cell debris is filtered prior to incubation with nanoparticles.
Here, a moderately higher binding capacity can also be reached (0.33
g g–1) under the same buffer conditions (50 mM Tris
buffer at pH 7). This slight difference can be explained by an improved
accessibility of nanoparticles in the complex suspension, protein–protein
interactions, and coadsorption processes. His6-GFP adsorption
to BIONs can also be observed in the lysate still containing cell
debris even though with a lower affinity. Here, the same binding capacity
to BIONs as for pure His6-GFP can be reached. However,
a high affinity of magnetic nanoparticles to cell walls of different
organisms is assumed.24,27,47 Hence, our adsorption experiments indicate that His6-GFP
selectively binds to the BION surface, which is the basis for an efficient
separation process.

Figure 1 (A) Adsorption isotherms of His6-GFP to BIONs
in different
buffer systems. All experiments contain 1 g L–1 BIONs
with varying GFP concentrations. The GFP has a purity > 95% and
the
buffers at pH 7 contain 50 mM ions plus saline in case of TBS. The
reference of nontagged GFP was conducted in Tris buffer. Error bars
represent the standard deviation (±SD) of experiments in triplicate
and the respective analyses in triplicate (nine measurements each).

lysate in 50 mM Tris buffer with 1 g L–1 BIONs.
Error bars represent the standard deviation (±SD) of experiments
in duplicate and the respective analyses in triplicate (six measurements
each).

For purification processes, the
recovery of target molecules is
often difficult and more time sensitive than the separation and thus
should be investigated thoroughly. Therefore, we compared different
elution possibilities. As the binding should be mainly through the
histidine tag, a reasonable possibility for elution is the change
of electrostatic properties by a pH shift that can deprotonate or
protonate the surface as well as the His6-tag. Another
strategy is the replacement of coordinative bonds of histidine subunits
to iron ions by imidazole molecules and the weakening of electrostatic
interactions by the introduction of a higher ionic strength with sodium
and chloride ions.34,62 Imidazole is commonly used as
an eluent by replacing histidine side chains due to a similar coordination
to metal ions for purification processes of His-tagged proteins with
IMAC. Therefore, several buffers with focus on different imidazole
concentrations are compared for their elution ability and summarized
in Figure 2. The incubation
of His6-GFP with BIONs was conducted in Tris buffer at
pH 7 and a pH shift to pH 9 or 5 leads to two completely different
results. Although around 60% of the previously adsorbed GFP is eluted
with a pH shift to basic environments, no protein elution can be observed
for a pH shift toward the acidic region. The buffer leading to the
lowest affinity of His6-GFP to BIONs investigated here,
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), combined with a slight pH shift also
leads to an elution of around 65% of His6-GFP bound to
BIONs during the incubation. Slightly higher desorption rates can
be observed using a common IMAC elution buffer based on a phosphate
buffer containing NaCl and imidazole. However, the amount of imidazole
does not affect desorption with decreasing concentrations from 500
to 50 mM. The results indicate that a clever manipulation of the system’s
electrostatic properties can lead to either a stable bound protein
or an elution with unbound proteins. Considering the high binding
capacity of His6-GFP and the specific surface area of magnetic
nanoparticles, there is only little space left for large cell fragments
to also bind to the BION surface.

Figure 2 Elution of His6-GFP with different
buffers (TBS 50 mM
at pH 9 and 5, PBS pH 7.4, and imidazole IMAC buffer pH 7.5: 500,
400, 300, 200, 100, and 50 mM).

Protein adsorption to nanoparticles in complex media is usually
a very fast process and the first surface layer is established after
a few seconds.17,63 From our observations, His6-GFP behaves accordingly even considering the agglomeration
of BIONs and thus no diffusion limitations can be observed.64 However, the time span necessary for desorption
processes is usually longer than for adsorption due to the different
driving forces for adsorption and desorption.65,66 Here, the His6-GFP desorption was monitored over 1 day
(Figure 3). For His-GFP
bound to BIONs, incubation with the IMAC elution buffer leads to an
immediate desorption (30 s) of around 10% proteins. After 5 min of
incubation, around 30% of the protein can be desorbed and is found
in the supernatant. With increasing incubation time, the amount of
unbound GFP increases. The effect weakens with time, even though no
stabilization of the elution maximum can be observed after 3 h. Most
His6-GFP is already desorbed after 30 min and around 70%
is desorbed after an hour, with a maximal elution efficiency of 78%
after 24 h (Figure 3A). The same behavior can be observed for purified His6-GFP bound to BIONs and a His6-GFP-containing cleared
cell lysate bound within a protein corona around BIONs (Figure 3B). Possible explanations for
this strongly time-dependent desorption behavior are the different
diffusion behaviors for adsorption and elution as well as different
adsorption and desorption kinetics.65,66 Interestingly,
no other protein can be observed with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) during the elution even though His6-GFP at 27.8 kDa only accounts for 30% of the proteins in
the cleared lysate (Figure 4A). Furthermore, no GFP dimers are visible in the elution
fraction, which was the case after protein recovery from the IMAC
column. Fluorescence microscopy also visually illustrates the bound
His6-GFP on the BIONs (Figure 4B,C). Here, a slight decrease can be observed
for the second elution step, whereas only a low amount of fluorescent
components can be detected after an elution with IMAC buffer (Figure 4D). For the reference
process with nontagged GFP, no binding can be detected with fluorescence
microscopy and SDS-PAGE (Figures 4E and S8). However, whereas
most of the protein can be recovered, some His6-GFP is
lost during the washing and some His6-GFP remains bound
even during two elution steps (Figure 4F). Furthermore, a second band occurs around 35 kDa
in the SDS-PAGE of the cell lysate protein corona, which is not desorbed
by the IMAC buffer. This band only occurs in the corona for incubation
with His6-GFP lysate and not for the nontagged GFP lysate.
With matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry, the outer membrane protein F (ompF) can be identified,
which is responsible for the second band. The adsorption of ompF can
be related to the similarities to GFP such as the β-barrel shape.67 Furthermore, ompF contains many aspartate and
glutamate subunits, which are mostly located at the terminal or peripheral
sites of the protein, which are known to bind well to iron oxide nanoparticles.61,67−69 Both lysates originate from the same E. coli strain, and this species cannot be detected
in the elution fractions. Thus, this protein band is most likely a
compound of His6-GFP and other smaller proteins, which
means that coadsorption with other proteins might actually improve
the separation and recovery of His6-GFP.

The simple application of a commercially
available affinity tag
by low-cost BIONs aroused our interest and we tried to implement a
large-scale purification process with this system.70 A rotor–stator separator (26 rotor and 25 stator
plates) is used for the separation process. The sufficient magnetic
field for the high-gradient magnetic fishing process is generated
by an electromagnet (Figure S9). A magnetic
flux of up to 0.6 T is induced by the magnet, which is in good agreement
with a similar HGMF construction.38 One
liter of cleared lysate (1 g L–1 His6-GFP) is mixed with 1 L BIONs (5.5 g L–1) and then
processed in an HGMF pilot separator (Figure 5A). The particles and bound proteins are
magnetically separated from the supernatant and afterward redispersed
in 2 L of binding buffer (50 mM Tris buffer pH 7) for two washing
steps. The concentrations of the protein-containing lysate and BIONs
were chosen comparable to the lab-scale experiments to ensure a proper
ratio between particles and His6-GFP and thus a reasonable
upscaling of the process. However, a large amount of His6-GFP is removed with the supernatant and in the first washing step
(Figure 5B,C). Fluorescence
measurements and SDS-PAGE of the different fractions match the optical
observations (Table 1 and Figure S10). This loss can mainly
be attributed to a pronounced foam formation during the redispersion
with a moving rotor. Other reasons are losses in the tubing and separator
chamber as well as difficulties with the upscaling of the magnetic
separation and desorption process from the laboratory to liter scale.
All these effects might influence the process significantly. However,
the redispersion efficiency of magnetic particles in this rotor–stator
HGMF separator is superior to that of static magnetizable matrices
used for magnetic filtration.39 Hence,
a yield of 38% can still be reached with one elution using an IMAC
buffer with only 50 mM imidazole content. The highlight of this process
is the purity of 91%, which can be reached in this single-step purification,
which accounts for a purification factor of 2.5 (Table S1). To our knowledge, no HGMF processes exist that
lead to comparable results for the purification of a model protein
with a His6-tag by low-cost BIONs.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the manipulation
of a protein corona
originating from E. coli cell lysate
around BIONs for the purification of a His6-tagged model
protein. A high affinity of the tag to BIONs can be verified for pure
His6-GFP solutions as well as for His6-GFP in
complex cell lysates. In most investigated buffer systems (acetate,
MES, TBS, Tris), the established tag demonstrates a high affinity
to the BION surface. Furthermore, high binding capacities of up to
50% surface coverage can be reached for His6-tagged proteins,
whereas a nontagged GFP does not show a high affinity and binding
capacity to our particles. Thus, binding through the tag can be concluded,
which can be substantiated with elution experiments where bound His6-GFP can be eluted in a manner similar to that in commercially
available IMAC columns. We combined these observations with a low-cost
resource-friendly one-step purification process in the liter scale,
which reaches a protein purity of 91%. Thus, we were able to demonstrate
a successful upscaling of the process. However, these first proof
of principle for the purification of His6-tagged proteins
with BIONs still meets many challenges. For industrially relevant
processes, the loss of protein during adsorption and washing steps
needs to be significantly reduced. Therefore, the tubing and the geometry
of the separation chamber inlets and outlets should be improved, while
foam formation needs to be suppressed during the whole process. Furthermore,
the processing of higher protein and lysate concentrations and therefore
of higher BION concentrations is desirable for more efficient processes.
The recirculation of the supernatant as well as the reuse of nanoadsorbents
is feasible; thus, this process can be operated with lower amounts
of buffers and adsorbents and is therefore more sustainable than chromatographic
techniques. Furthermore, no expensive functionalization with, or regeneration
of, harmful metal ions is necessary. Consequently, this investigation
might pave the way for new processing strategies based on magnetic
separation principles for a greener downstream processing of proteins.

Experimental
Section
All reagents used are commercially available, have
a purity of
>95% (high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC grade), and
were
used as received without further purification. FeCl3·6H2O and sodium hydroxide were purchased from AppliChem GmbH,
Germany, in the highest purity available. FeCl2·4H2O extra pure was obtained from Merck KGaA, Germany. The buffers
are based on 50 mM phosphate, acetate, morpholino ethane sulfonic
acid (MES), or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) and double distilled
water. Tris-buffered saline (TBS), citrate-buffered saline (CBS),
and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contain additional 137 mM NaCl
and 2.7 mM KCl, and 50 mM Tris, 50 mM citrate, and 50 mM phosphate,
respectively. The imidazole elution buffer contains 500 mM NaCl, 50
mM NaH2PO4·2H2O, varying concentrations
of imidazole between 50 and 500 mM, and double distilled water.

Magnetite was synthesized with a coprecipitation method described
elsewhere.42,55 Therefore, 21.2 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 8.29 g of FeCl2·4H2O were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized and degassed water.
This iron chloride solution was added to 1 L of a 1 M solution of
NaOH prepared with deionized and degassed water in a stirring tank
reactor. The mixture was kept under nitrogen atmosphere for the whole
reaction. The particles were washed several times with water.

His6-GFP was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) regulated by a T5 promotor in a 1000 L stirring tank
reactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Bacteria were cultivated
at 37 °C in Riesenberg medium in a fed-batch process, and the
GFP expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside.71 Cells were separated from the residual fermentation
broth with a plate separator (CSA 08-06-476, GEA Westfalia Separator
Group GmbH, Oelde). The lysis was conducted with a high-pressure homogenizer
(Ariete NS3015H, GEA Niro Soavi, Parma IT), and the cell debris was
separated with a depth filter (Z12DD 302 (3 M)).

Further downstream
processing was only conducted to provide His6-GFP with
a purity of >99%. Therefore, a crossflow Sartoflow
(Sartorius AG, Göttingen) equipped with Hydrosart 0.45 μm
membranes (Sartorius) was used. This step was followed by anion-exchange
chromatography (AEX) and an affinity chromatography step, where a
HisTrap FF crude, loaded with a 5 mL nickel–nitrilo acid (Ni2+–NTA) column, was used in an ÄKTApurifier System
(GE Healthcare, Uppsala, SE). To change the buffer, protein solutions
were washed with the respective new buffer several times in Vivaspin
ultrafiltration spin columns (molecular weight cut-off 5k). The concentration
was adjusted with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay and fluorescence
measurements.

Adsorption and Elution Experiments
For the binding
experiments, different amounts of His6-GFP or lysate containing
His6-GFP were incubated with magnetite nanoparticles (1
g L–1) at different concentrations in Tris buffer
(50 mM, pH 7) for 1 h at 25 °C under vigorous shaking (1000 rpm).
Even though the adsorption of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces depicts
a dynamic equilibrium, for better comparison with other adsorption
processes, the adsorption isotherms are fitted with the Langmuir equation. 1  The surface coverage is calculated from qmax and the specific surface area Sm. Hereby, the specific surface area determined with the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method is used. The density ρ
of magnetite (5.2 g cm–3) was used for the calculation.

For the surface coverage θ, the smallest area of the barrel-shaped
GFP was considered (diameter 3 nm and height 4 nm).10,72 His6-GFP exhibits a molecular weight MGFP of 27.8 kDa (SI). 2  To study the desorption kinetics, different
incubation times were chosen, while an imidazole-containing IMAC elution
buffer, TBS (50 mM, pH 9 or 5), PBS (50 mM, pH 7.4), or CBS (50 mM,
pH 7) was used as the elution buffer. The supernatant was separated
from the particles with hand magnets, decanted, and analyzed with
an Infinite M200 Microplate Reader (Tecan Deutschland, Germany).

Protein Quantification
Supernatants from adsorption
and elution experiments were further analyzed regarding their GFP
content with fluorescence measurements, in an Infinite 200 Pro microplate
reader (Tecan, Austria) at an excitation wavelength of 484 nm and
detected at 515 nm, and HPLC.

For HPLC analysis of high-gradient
magnetic separation experiments, a reverse-phase C4Aeris Widepore
3.6 μm, 100 × 2.1 mm2 (Phenomenex, CA), was
used at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min–1. Samples were
diluted to a GFP content below 0.5 g L–1 and filtered
(0.2 μm) with a cellulose filter. A linear gradient from 40
to 70% acetonitrile (20 mM trifluoro acetic acid, TFA) with double
distilled water (20 mM TFA) over 16 min was run for the separation
of GFP from other proteins. The proteins were detected at 215 nm.

The total protein content was determined with a BCA assay (Pierce
BCA Kit, Thermo Scientific, MA). The samples were diluted with the
respective buffer.

The aliquots were further analyzed with sodium
dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were denatured
at 95 °C for 5 min and stained with a Coomassie blue solution
prior to loading on a 5% acrylamide stacking gel and run on a 15%
separating gel under reducing conditions. Unstained protein marker
(broad range, 2–212 kDa) was used as a reference. Here, 10
μL of the reference were applied, whereas 14 μL of the
samples were used. All samples were applied undiluted unless stated
otherwise.

For SDS-PAGE of the particle corona, samples were
denatured at
100 °C for 5 min and stained with a Coomassie blue solution prior
to loading on a 5% acrylamide stacking gel and run on a 10% separating
gel under reducing conditions. Color protein standard broad range
(10–250 kDa) was used as a reference. Here, 7.5 μL of
the reference were applied, whereas 15 μL of the samples were
used. All samples were applied in an undiluted state unless stated
otherwise.

Fluorescence microscopy was conducted with an Andor
(Nikon) spinning
disk microscope equipped with a CFI Plan Apo 100× objective.
Samples, which were diluted 1:10 with deionized water prior to analysis,
were excited with a laser (488 nm), and the resulting emission was
detected at 520 nm.

High-Gradient Magnetic Fishing (HGMF)
The processing
device comprises a stirred batch adsorption reactor equipped with
a peristaltic pump, computer-controlled valves, a bubble detector,
and an associated stirrer. The electromagnet is water cooled and can
generate a magnetic flux density of up to 0.25 T. The rotor–stator
magnetic filter has a working volume of 980 mL and includes 25 stator
and 26 rotor disks with an internal diameter of 86 mm. The maximum
flow rate for the separator is 1400 mL min–1. A
flow rate of 200 mL min–1 was adjusted and used
for the separation experiments. The residence time in the separation
chamber for the experiments is 500 s. Particles are recovered from
the separator by spinning the disks at a rotation speed of 1500 rpm.

Processing Steps
After incubation of the lysate and
nanoparticles, the process includes a separation step, where the supernatant
and the nanoparticles are separated magnetically, followed by two
washing steps and an elution step.

Briefly, the cleared cell
lysate containing 2.99 g protein with a His6-GFP content
of 32% is incubated with 11 g BIONs in 2 L of continuously stirred
50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7). The mixture is stirred at 1000 rpm for 60
min at room temperature prior to being pumped into the switched-on
magnetic separator chamber. The supernatant is collected and analyzed,
whereas the magnetic nanoparticles stick to the magnetized rotor and
stator disks. The particles are backwashed with a new incubation buffer
(50 mM Tris buffer pH 7) without magnetic field, but with a switched-on
rotor, and circulated in the chamber before re-entering the chamber,
which is again magnetized while the rotor is switched off. This procedure
is repeated for the second wash step. For the elution, the particles
containing bound GFP are pumped with the IMAC buffer (50 mM imidazole)
to an external tank. Here, the elution is allowed for 1 h under vigorous
stirring. After this procedure, the magnetic particles are backwashed
again in Tris buffer. All fractions are collected and further analyzed
concerning their GFP and protein content.
