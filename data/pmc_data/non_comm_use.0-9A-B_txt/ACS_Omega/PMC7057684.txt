A set of unique triptycene-based
and organic Schiff-base-linked
polymers (TBOSBLs) are conveniently synthesized in which
triptycene motifs are connected with 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol
units via Schiff-base linkages. TBOSBLs are amorphous,
thermally stable with a reasonable surface area (SABET up
to 649 m2/g), and have abundant nanopores (pore size <
100 nm). TBOSBLs are good sorbents for small gas molecules
(such as CO2, H2, and N2) and they
can selectively capture CO2 over N2. Additionally, TBOSBLs show superior antiproliferative activity against human
colorectal cancer cells relative to previously reported covalent organic
frameworks (COFs). The mechanism of cell death is also studied elaborately.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
term “cancer” is usually associated with a disease
wherein there is an abnormal cell growth in a certain body organ.1 Cancer is a potentially life-threatening disease
that is usually associated with a specific body part but may subsequently
spread to other parts of the body. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), “Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally,
and was responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018”.2 Based on its origin, cancer can be classified
by oncologists as carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemia, and lymphomas.3 Uncontrolled growth of cancer cells is seen most
commonly in lungs, followed by breast, colon/rectum, prostate, skin,
and stomach.2 As far as cancer mortality
is concerned, colorectal cancer ranks second after lung cancer. With
the current advancement in medical sciences, prevention of death due
to cancer is possible, if the disease is diagnosed and treated at
an early stage. Among others, chemotherapy is a common mode of treatment.
In general, cancer treatment is expensive requiring costly medications.
Moreover, carcinoma cells may become resistant to prevalent chemotherapy
by a mechanism called “multi-drug resistance” (MDR).
Therefore, contemporary research demands design, development, and
screening of new compounds/molecules/materials with antiproliferative
activity against various cancer cells.4,5

In present-day
research, there is also a lot of research interest
in exploring biomedical applications of porous materials.5 Such applications include, but are not limited
to, chemotherapy, drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, and
others.6−9 In the context of porous materials, porous organic polymers (POPs)
are highly cross-linked macromolecular frameworks containing lighter
elements such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and others. Thus, POPs
are distinctly different from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs—another
class of porous materials) that are inorganic and contain relatively
heavier (metal) atoms. In the literature, there are several examples
wherein metal-based porous materials, such as zeolites and MOFs, have
been considered for biomedical applications.10 However, the metal-induced toxicity and chemical instability of
MOFs make them undesirable candidates for such applications.11,12 On the other hand, the absence of inherent toxicity of metal atoms
and higher chemical stability observed in POPs render them more suitable
as candidates for biological studies. Additionally, POPs have high
surface areas and tunable porosity, and are usually obtained easily
from inexpensive and commercially available monomers. Therefore, the
current research trend is to explore the interaction of POPs with
biological species.6 In this field, the
exploration of anticancer activities of POPs decorated with various
organic functional groups is still in the stage of infancy. Another
major application of porous materials is in the domain of carbon dioxide
capture and sequestration (CCS).13,14

Triptycene
is a rigid and structurally robust molecule. Its incorporation
as a structural motif in polymeric frameworks has yielded POPs having
excellent gas storage ability.15−18 The paddle wheel orientation of the arene rings in
triptycene causes these units to pack inefficiently in the polymeric
network. This also generates an “internal molecular free volume”
(IFV) in the resultant material. The void in the form of IFV, in turn,
gives rise to desirable characteristics, such as excellent gas storage
capability and high surface areas.19

Herein, we report the synthesis of three “triptycene-based
and organic Schiff-base-linked” polymers (TBOSBLs) prepared via a facile condensation reaction between di- or triaminotriptycene
and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TFP). The obtained polymeric networks
were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction
(XRD). It was anticipated that TBOSBLs would be porous
since they bear triptycene motifs in the polymeric framework.20,21 Thus, we have explored their porous properties (surface area/pore
size distribution (PSD)) and measured their ability to capture small
gas molecules, such as CO2, H2, and N2.

A thorough literature search revealed that polymeric materials
derived from polyphenolic units such as phloroglucinol may have considerable
potential in research related to cancer therapy.22,23 This motivated us to explore the anticancer activity of the three TBOSBLs reported herein. Further, we have explored whether TBOSBLs are apoptotic inducers while proposing a mechanism
of cell death. TBOSBLs are the only example of triptycene-based
POPs whose cytotoxic potential against cancer cells has been studied.
The mechanism of cell death was also studied.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of TBOSBL
1–3
2,6-Diaminotriptycene (DAT) and 2,6,14-
and 2,7,14-triaminotriptycene were synthesized from triptycene based
on a protocol reported previously by Chen and co-workers.24 1,3,5-Triformylphloroglucinol (TFP) was also
synthesized, as described in a literature report.25TBOSBLs were synthesized via a facile condensation
reaction between di- or triaminotriptycene and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol
(TFP) in a solution mixture of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 2 mol % in THF) at 60 °C for 3 days
(Scheme 1). The resulting
precipitate was collected by suction filtration and washed subsequently
with tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), water, methanol, acetone, and dichloromethane, separately.
The precipitate obtained was washed with various solvents to ensure
removal of any unreacted monomers and undesired byproducts, such as
soluble small oligomers. The collected powder was then dried at 120
°C under vacuum for 24 h to yield a yellow powder with high yield
and insoluble in common organic solvents.

Scheme 1 Syntheses of TBOSBL 1–3
Solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning
(CP-MAS) NMR spectra were recorded to investigate the formation of TBOSBLs, as proposed in Scheme 2. The 13C CP-MAS spectra of TBOSBLs are depicted in Figure 1. Taking TBOSBL1 as a representative example,
peaks with different chemical shifts appearing in its NMR spectrum
are assigned appropriately in Figure 1. In all three spectra, the strong signal appearing
at 52 ppm is assigned to the bridgehead carbons present in the triptycene
unit, thereby indicating the incorporation of triptycene motifs in
the reaction product. The peaks in the range 116–136 ppm are
due to the carbons that constitute the three arene rings present in
the triptycene moiety. The band centered at 185 ppm is assigned to
deshielded carbonyl carbon atoms, the low-intensity signal at 146
ppm is assigned to the enamine carbon nuclei, and the peak at 108
ppm is due to sp2 hybridized carbon nuclei of the phloroglucinol
unit in the final product. Also, the absence of a unique signal at
191 ppm (due to carbon present in the aldehyde group −CHO of TFP) confirmed that all three aldehyde groups present
in triformylphloroglucinol (TFP) molecules reacted completely with
aminotriptycenes in the Schiff-base condensation reaction shown in Scheme 1.

Figure 1 Solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectra of TBOSBL 1–3.

Scheme 2 Structures of TBOSBLs
FTIR spectra of TBOSBLs are shown
in Figure 2. The FTIR
spectrum of TBOSBL1 has been described as a representative
example. For
comparison, the FTIR spectra of the corresponding triptycene-based
amine monomer (DAT) and TFP are also depicted in Figure 2. Upon comparing the FTIR spectra
of monomers DAT and TFP, and their polymerized product (TBOSBL1), it can be concluded that both monomers have reacted completely.
In the spectrum of TBOSBL1, the absence of the carbonyl
(C=O) stretching band characteristic of TFP (1652 cm–1) indicates its consumption in the polymerization reaction and its
incorporation in TBOSBL1. Formation of enamine linkages
in the products is confirmed from the appearance of a high-intensity
band at 1290 cm–1 due to C–N stretching vibrations.
The high-intensity signal at 1448 cm–1 is assigned
to C–H bending vibrations. The existence of TFP in its keto
form (as depicted in Scheme 1) is evident from the appearance of a high-intensity and sharp
band at 1586 cm–1 in TBOSBL1 since
this is characteristic of C=C bond stretching vibrations observed
in the keto form of TFP.26,27 This is also supported
by the fact that stretching bands of hydroxyl (in enol form of TFP)
are absent in the FTIR spectrum of TBOSBL1.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra
of 2,6-diaminotriptycene (DAT), TFP, and TBOSBLs.

To investigate the structural morphology of TBOSBLs, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
was employed.
FE-SEM images of TBOSBLs at two different magnifications
(10.00k× and 50.00k×) are shown in Figure 3. Higher resolution images indicate the presence
of uniform spherical particles that have self-assembled to form large
aggregated particles. From inspection, in the case of TBOSBL1, the spherical particles are dimensionally bigger than those of TBOSBL2 and TBOSBL3. As depicted in Scheme 2, TBOSBL1 is obtained from diaminotriptycene,
while the other two TBOSBLs are obtained from triaminotriptycenes.
Therefore, in the former case (TBOSBL1), the extent of
polymerization is expected to be lower and the chance of aggregation
via H-bonding is more. This might have led to the formation of bigger
aggregates in the case of TBOSBL1. The grain size of
the polymers was estimated from the FE-SEM images, and the average
diameter of grains is 400 ± 20, 200 ± 20, and 200 ±
20 nm for TBOSBL1, TBOSBL2, and TBOSBL3, respectively.

Figure 3 FE-SEM images of TBOSBLs.

The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) plots of TBOSBLs are shown in Figure 4A. Here, the appearance of a hump (2θ value = 18°) suggests
that these polymeric materials are amorphous in nature. The Schiff-base
condensation reaction is fast and irreversible, and this leads to
the incorporation of bulky and robust three-dimensional (3D) rigid
triptycene units. The rigidity of triptycene units prevents efficient
packing that leads to materials with loss of crystallinity, as observed
in TBOSBLs and other previously reported triptycene-based
POPs.20,28 Samples of TBOSBL 1–3 are subjected to TGA analysis to record the thermal stability
of these polymeric materials. TGA experiments were performed under
a constant flow of nitrogen gas in the temperature region of 40–800
°C by heating samples at a rate of 10 °C/min. The TGA plot
of each TBOSBL is shown in Figure 4B. The observed initial weight loss in the
temperature range of 325–500 °C is attributed to the thermal
degradation of organic functional groups. Overall, TBOSBLs may be considered as materials with moderate thermal stability,
as observed from the reasonably high thermal degradation temperature
(Td = 10% weight loss under a N2 atmosphere) that varies in the range 388–462 °C. We
attribute this desirable feature to the inclusion of robust 3D triptycene
units in the polymer framework.29,30

2.2 Porosity Measurements
In recent literature
related to POPs derived from triptycene-based monomers, it has been
observed that such materials have reasonable surface areas with inherent
hierarchical porosity for applications such as CO2 capture
and hydrogen storage.17,31,32 This prompted us to investigate the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas and the pore size distributions of TBOSBLs. Thus, to determine the porous properties of TBOSBLs in detail, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
were recorded. The features of N2 sorption isotherms (collected
at 77 K, Figure 5A)
of TBOSBLs suggest that they may be classified as type-II
isotherms.33 This class of isotherms are
usually given by porous materials that have a hierarchical pore structure
(coexistence of narrower micropores and relatively wider mesopores).
The presence of micropores was evident from the significantly high
gas uptake in the very low relative pressure range (P/P0 = 0–0.01), which is depicted
as a sharp increase in the corresponding adsorption isotherm.20 The microporosity present in TBOSBLs may be due to the incorporation of the 3D rigid triptycene units
in the polymeric linkages.34 On the other
hand, the constant increase in N2 uptake in the relatively
higher partial pressure range (P/P0 = 0.1–0.99) suggested the existence of mesopores
in the polymeric matrix.35 Using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) model, the surface areas were found to be 649 m2/g
(TBOSBL1), 570 m2/g (TBOSBL2),
and 493 m2/g (TBOSBL3) (Table 1 and Figure S1). The corresponding Langmuir surface areas for TBOSBL1, TBOSBL2, and TBOSBL3 are 1051, 810, and
817 m2/g, respectively (Table 1 and Figure S2). These values are comparable with or better than the surface areas
recorded for previously reported microporous materials with Schiff-base
linkages. For example, nitrogen-rich microporous and crystalline covalent
organic frameworks (COFs) bearing multiple phenolic −OH groups,
synthesized via the Schiff-base condensation reaction, have relatively
lower SABET (535 m2/g for TpPa-1 and 339 m2/g for TpPa-2) than TBOSBL1.36 Other examples of porous materials with a lower surface
area include, but are not limited to, β-ketoenamine-linked COFs
(365 m2/g for DAB-TFP COF),37 β-ketoenamine-based COFs (567 m2/g for TAPB-TFP),38 ionic covalent organic nanosheets (TpTGCl, TpTGBr, and TpTGI: 267, 305, and
298 m2/g, respectively),39 porous
polymer TPDA-1 (545 m2/g),40 nitrogen-rich porous organic polymers (104–518 m2/g for N-POPs),41 COF materials bearing
phloroglucinol building units (223 m2/g for EDTFP-1),22 N-rich porous organic polymer methylenedianiline-triformylphloroglucinol
(283 m2/g for MDTFP-1)23 and
triazine-functionalized porous covalent organic frameworks (277 m2/g for TpTt COF).25

isotherms (P/P0 = 0.05–0.35).

b The total pore volume of TBOSBLs calculated at P/P0 = 0.99.

As
usual, corresponding pore size distribution plots were obtained
using the N2 sorption isotherms and the density functional
theory (DFT) method. As predicted from the N2 isotherms,
the pore size distribution (PSD) profile of TBOSBLs (Figure 5B) having maxima
below and above 2 nm confirms that pores are microporous (<2 nm)
as well as mesoporous (2–6 nm). The total pore volume of each TBOSBL is calculated from the volume of N2 adsorbed
at P/P0 = 0.99, and this
parameter is measured to be 0.527 cm3/g for TBOSBL1, 0.384 cm3/g for TBOSBL2, and 0.467 cm3/g for TBOSBL3 (Table 1). These data indicate that both surface
area and total pore volume are relatively lower for the POPs (TBOSBL2 and TBOSBL3) derived from the trifunctional
triptycenes in comparison with the one (TBOSBL1) derived
from the bifunctional triptycene monomer. Thus, the porosity and surface
area of TBOSBLs may be tailored easily by changing the
number of reactive sites in the monomers.

2.3 Gas Storage
and Selective CO2 Capture
over N2
Considering the nanoporous nature of TBOSBLs, we were interested in studying their ability to act
as an adsorbent for small gaseous molecules, such H2 and
CO2. Therefore, adsorption isotherms of H2 (at
77 K), CO2 (at 273, 298 K), and N2 (at 273,
298 K) were collected at pressures up to 1 bar. The interest in exploring
the ability of porous materials to store H2 gas has assumed
importance since hydrogen gas is projected to replace fossil fuel
for the global energy requirements, especially in the transportation
sector. The H2 uptake by TBOSBLs was found
to be in the range of 12.9–19.5 mg/g (Table 1 and Figure 6A). The highest value was observed for TBOSBL1 (19.5 mg/g or 1.95 wt % at 77 K), and this value was better than
those of various microporous organic polymers and COFs—representative
examples are triptycene-derived azo polymers (TAP3, 1.44 wt %),20 azo-Trip (1.46 wt %),42 3D ultramicroporous triptycene-based polyimide frameworks (1.41
wt %),43 carbazole-based porous organic
polymers (CPOPs 1.19–1.29 wt %),44 solvothermally synthesized TpBD (0.7 wt %),45 TpPa-1, TpPa-2 (1.1, 0.89 wt %),45 TAPB-TFP
(1.08 wt %),38 and porous porphyrin organic
polymers (TpTph, 1.25 wt %).46 From the
above comparison, it is clear that TBOSBLs reported herein
have improved H2 uptake capabilities than several microporous
polymers and imine-based COFs.

isotherms at 273 K (B) and 298 K (C), and Qst for CO2 (D) of TBOSBLs.

The continuous increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is a very serious environmental issue. The main challenges
are to propose efficient means to remove atmospheric CO2 and develop technologies for effective carbon dioxide capture and
sequestration (CCS). In this context, physisorption of carbon dioxide
by porous materials is a widely researched CCS process that has been
highlighted in several reviews. It must be mentioned that recent research
achievements in this field using porous organic polymers (POPs) for
CO2 capture are noteworthy. An important feature that a
porous material must have to qualify for its application in CCS technology
is its ability to selectively capture CO2 in the presence
of N2. Thus, we were also curious to explore the ability
of TBOSBLs to selectively capture CO2 over
N2. CO2 sorption isotherms of TBOSBLs were measured at two temperatures 273 K (Figure 6B) and 298 K (Figure 6C) at pressures up to 1 atm. The gravimetric
uptake of CO2 was the highest for TBOSBL1 (175
mg/g), while it was the lowest for TBOSBL3 (125 mg/g),
as shown in Table 1. Quantitatively, the amount of CO2 captured by TBOSBL1 (175 mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar) is better than those
by all previously reported imine-based COFs synthesized via the Schiff-base
condensation reaction, such as TpPa-1 (153 mg/g),36 TpBD (84 mg/g),45 TpPa-F4 (69
mg/g),47 a freshly activated sample of
UCBZ-1 (77 mg/g),48 and TpTph (163 mg/g).46 Moreover, this is also higher than the amounts
captured by various porous organic polymers, N-rich porous polymers,
and triptycene-based microporous polymers, such as N-rich POPs (109
mg/g),41 amine-based cross-linked porous
polymers (66.8 mg/g),49 nanoporous organic
polymers (NOPs, 86–142 mg/g),50 azo-functionalized
microporous organic polymers (77.7–134.8 mg/g),51 porous covalent triazine polymers (CTPs, 6.6–29.5
mg/g),52 hexaphenylbenzene-based conjugated
microporous polymers (HCMPs, 43–75 mg/g),53 3D ultramicroporous triptycene-based polyimide frameworks
(149.6 mg/g),43 and triptycene-derived
azo polymers bearing phloroglucinol units (TAPs, 95–150 mg/g).20 The selectivity of CO2/N2 was calculated using the Henry law and on the basis of initial slope
calculations in the pressure range of 0–0.1 bar (Figures S3 and S4). The CO2/N2 selectivity results of TBOSBLs are depicted
in Table 1. TBOSBLs (TBOSBL1–TBOSBL3) show a reasonably
high CO2/N2 selectivity (68–108) at 273
K, and this value is better than those of various literature-reported
porous materials, such as ACOF-1 (40),54 TpPa-COF (MW) (32),55 covalent triazine-based
frameworks (CTFs, 20–25),56 azo-linked
polymers (ALPs, 44–60),57 azine-linked
covalent organic frameworks (COF-JLU2, 77),58 and triptycene-based 1,2,3-triazole-linked networks (31–48).59 Among the three triptycene-based POPs reported
herein, TBOSBL3 exhibited the highest selectivity (108)
for CO2 over N2 at 273 K. On the other hand,
the CO2/N2 selectivity was the lowest for TBOSBL1 (68) under similar experimental conditions.

A noticeable decrease in CO2/N2 selectivity
at a higher temperature (298 K) was observed for TBOSBL2 and TBOSBL3, as shown in Table 1. This trend (decreased selectivity at a
higher temperature) has commonly been observed for most POPs reported
to date.35 For TBOSBL1, the
selectivity changes marginally at elevated temperatures (68 at 273
K to 69 at 298 K). The Qst (isosteric
heats of adsorption) value of TBOSBLs for CO2 uptake was directly calculated from the experimental adsorption
data collected at 273 and 298 K using the Clausius–Clapeyron
relation. The Qst values for CO2 were observed to be in the range 30–35 kJ/mol at zero coverage
(Table 1 and Figure 6D). Thus, TBOSBLs capture CO2 via physisorption processes because the
magnitude of Qst is less than 40 kJ/mol.60 The reasonably high Qst value hints at moderate interactions between the polarizable CO2 molecule (Lewis acidic) and the abundant N–H sites
(CO2-philic and Lewis basic) on the pore wall of TBOSBLs via hydrogen bonds. The Qst values of CO2 for TBOSBLs are comparable
with those of previous literature-reported porous organic polymers,
such as ACOF-1 (27.6 kJ/mol),54 COF-JLU2
(31 kJ/mol),58 and TpPa-COF (MW) (34.1
kJ/mol).55

2.4 Anticancer
Activity of TBOSBLs
A thorough literature survey
indicated that there are
a handful of reports on porous COFs that demonstrated appreciable
anticancer activity against cancer cells, as evident from the low
magnitude of IC50 values.22,23,61 Motivated by these results, we too were curious to
explore the potential of TBOSBLs as antiproliferative
agents. To the best of our knowledge, such studies are not known for
POPs derived from triptycene-based monomers. Thus, TBOSBLs were screened against HCT-116 (human colorectal) cancer cells.
Treatment with different concentrations of TBOSBLs (0–10
μg/mL) for 6 h amplified the cell death significantly (Figure 7A), and the IC50 values were estimated to be 5.01 ± 1.38, 5.71 ±
1.81, and 6.4 ± 1.54 μg/mL for TBOSBL3, TBOSBL2, and TBOSBL1 respectively. The IC50 values of TBOSBLs are lower than that of 5-fluorouracil
(a chemotherapeutic drug with IC50 = 10.24 ± 2.14
μg/mL). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of TBOSBL3 is also superior to those of previous literature-reported porous
polymeric materials, such as a triazine-based p-conjugated mesoporous
two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic framework—“TrzCOF”
(IC50 = 8.31 ± 1.67 μg/mL),61 a porous biodegradable nitrogen containing COF—“EDTFP-1”
(IC50 = 9.89 ± 1.16 μg/mL),22 and N-rich porous organic polymer methylenedianiline-triformylphloroglucinol—“MDTFP-1”
(IC50 = 5.69 ± 1.02 μg/mL).23 Thus, preliminary experimental investigations revealed
that TBOSBL1–3 exhibited appreciable
cytotoxicity toward the HCT-116 cell line as per 4,5-(dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay data. The cytotoxicity of TBOSBL3 is higher than that of TBOSBL2 and this may be due
to a greater pore volume in the former than in the latter. The cytotoxicity
of TBOSBL3 is higher than that of TBOSBL1 since the former has more functionalized groups. Based on these
promising results as obtained from the MTT data, TBOSBL3 was selected for a further detailed study.

oxygen species (ROS) level with time of TBOSBL3-treated
HCT-116 cells. (C) Graphical presentation of annexin V, FITC/propidium
iodide (PI) positive cells with time of treatment with 5 μg/mL TBOSBL3 by flow cytometry. (D) % of apoptotic HCT-116 cells
in a time-dependent manner.

It is well known that an increase in cellular levels of ROS may
trigger apoptosis-induced cell death, thereby damaging proteins, nucleic
acids, lipids, membranes, and organelles.62 ROS generation, in turn, may be estimated using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA), which is a non-fluorescent molecule.
In the presence of ROS, H2DCFDA is oxidized to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF), the latter being a highly fluorescent molecule. It was observed
that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of DCF was significantly
(P < 0.05) increased in a time-dependent manner
upon TBOSBL3 treatment while checking the extent of ROS
generation (Figure 7B). This experiment was repeated several times to confirm the results
of ROS generation. To determine whether TBOSBL3 was involved
in apoptosis/necrosis, we have carried out the flow cytometric assessment
using annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining by reading the
exposed level of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer membrane of
cells (Figure 7C).
It is known that phosphatidylserine (PS) released on the outer leaflet
of the plasma membrane is broadly observed during apoptosis.63 Our result showed that the percentage of apoptotic
(early and late) cells was enhanced in a time-dependent manner (6.2%
EA/36.4% LA/39% necrosis for 6 h, 3.4% EA/20.9% LA/50.6% necrosis
for 12 h), with respect to the control cells (0.3% EA/0.1% LA/0.0%
necrosis) (Figure 7D).

These results hint at TBOSBL3-induced cell
death that
is associated with cytotoxicity followed by apoptosis. We have checked
the cytotoxicity of TBOSBL3 in a normal cell line, namely,
human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), where we detected that the
IC50 value is 24.7 μg/mL. Thus, from the magnitude
of IC50, it may be said that TBOSBL3 is almost
5 times less active against HEK293 (a normal cell line) relative to
HCT-116 (a cancer cell line). Tumor proteins p53 and p21 play a major
role in controlling the expression of genes involved in apoptosis.64 Therefore, after confirmation of ROS-induced
apoptosis by TBOSBL3, the expression of these two apoptotic
markers (p53 and p21) was estimated (Figure 8A). Experimental results suggest that apoptosis
was induced in the HCT-116 cells with high levels of p53 expression.
The expression of p21 is induced by tumor suppressor gene p53. Our
confocal images showed a higher level of p53 and p21 in a time-dependent
manner after treatment with TBOSBL3, where 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) was used as the fluorescent stain for DNA. Activation of caspase-3
and caspase-9 is required for efficient execution of apoptosis,65 so we checked the expression of both these caspases.
The increased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Figure 8B) also confirmed that a mitochondria-mediated
apoptotic pathway occurred in a time-dependent manner while the cells
were treated with TBOSBL3.

3 Conclusions
In summary, this work reports
a facile synthesis and characterization
of a set of unique triptycene-based and organic Schiff-base-linked
polymers (TBOSBLs) using 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol
(TFP). The obtained polymeric networks are characterized using FTIR,
NMR, TGA, and XRD. TBOSBLs are porous organic polymers
(POPs) with a reasonable surface area (SABET up to 649
m2/g). TBOSBLs have the ability to capture
small gas molecules, such as CO2, H2, and N2. While CO2 uptake capacity is greater than 125
mg/g at 273 K and 1 bar pressure, TBOSBLs may be considered
as potential materials for molecular hydrogen storage (up to 19.5
mg/g at 77 K and 1 bar pressure). Further, TBOSBLs demonstrate
very good CO2/N2 selectively (up to 108) at
273 K. Inspired by earlier reports of cytotoxicity shown by COFs (bearing
phloroglucinol motifs) against cancer cells, TBOSBLs
are tested to check whether they show any activity against cancer/normal
cell lines. Indeed, the measured IC50 values for TBOSBLs against human colorectal cancer cells are noteworthy.
The mechanism of cell death is also studied elaborately. It is explored
whether TBOSBLs are apoptotic inducers while proposing
a mechanism of cell death. TBOSBLs are the only example
of triptycene-based POPs whose cytotoxic potential against cancer
cells have been studied to date. Results of in vitro studies using TBOSBLs presented in this work suggest that this new set of
POPs have immense potential as anticancer therapeutic agents.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Triptycene,
TFA, and phloroglucinol
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and they were used without further
purification. Hexamethylene tetramine was procured from CDH. THF was
also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was dried using common laboratory
techniques before use in reactions.

4.2 Instrumentation
Solid-state 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning
(CP-MAS) NMR spectra
of TBOSBL 1–3 were recorded on a
Bruker 400 spectrometer equipped with an 89 mm wide bore and a 9.4
T superconducting magnet with a spinning rate of 12 kHz and CP contact
time of 2 ms with a delay time of 2 s. FTIR spectra of TBOSBL
1–3 were collected using a Shimadzu IR
Affinity-1 spectrometer. P-XRD analysis data were collected using
a Rigaku TTRAX III X-ray diffractometer. TGA plots were recorded using
a TG-DSC STA 449 F3 Jupiter (NETZSCH, Selb, Germany) at a scan rate
of 10 °C/min under nitrogen flow (100 mL/min). FE-SEM images
were obtained using a Carl Zeiss AG instrument (model SUPRA 55). Porosity
and surface area were estimated using a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ2 analyzer. In a typical gas experimental setup, TBOSBLs (80–120 mg) were charged in a 9 mm cell and were exposed
to degassing at 120 °C for 6–10 h by attaching to a degassing
unit. Subsequently, the cells with degassed polymeric samples were
filled up with helium gas and weighed accurately for analysis. Various
temperatures of the analysis unit sample cell were maintained using
a KGW isotherm bath (provided by Quantachrome), which was filled with
liquid N2 (77 K), or a temperature-controlled bath (298
and 273 K).

4.3 Synthesis Procedure of TBOSBLs
4.3.1 Synthesis of TBOSBL1
Experiments for the synthesis of TBOSBLs (Scheme 1) are described using TBOSBL1 as a typical example. 1,3,5-Triformylphloroglucinol
(1) (105 mg, 0.5 mmol) and diaminotriptycene (2) (214 mg, 0.75 mmol) were dissolved under a flow of nitrogen gas
in a solution mixture of dry THF and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 2
mol % in THF). The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for
3 days, and the resulting precipitate was collected by suction filtration.
The yellow precipitate was washed with tetrahydrofuran, DMF, DMSO,
water, methanol, acetone, and dichloromethane, separately. The collected
powder was then dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 24 h to yield
a yellow powder with 83% isolated yield.

4.3.2 Synthesis
of TBOSBL2
TBOSBL2 has been synthesized
following a similar scheme
to that described for TBOSBL1. 1,3,5-Triformylphloroglucinol
(1) (157 mg, 0.75 mmol) and 2,7,14-triaminotriptycene
(3) (225 mg, 0.75 mmol) were used as monomers for the
synthesis of TBOSBL2. After drying at reduced pressure
at 120 °C, the final product was collected as a yellow powder
(yield 81%).

4.3.3 Synthesis of TBOSBL3
Here, 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (1) (157
mg, 0.75
mmol) and 2,6,14-triaminotriptycene (4) (225 mg, 0.75
mmol) were used as monomers. The final product was obtained as a yellow
powder (yield 80%).

4.4 Cell Culture
Briefly,
cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic cocktail
at 37 °C under constant 5% CO2 in a humidified condition.
After 75–80% confluence, cells were harvested with trypsin
(0.25%) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 0.52 mM) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and plated at a necessary density to allow them to re-equilibrate
before the experiment.

4.5 Cell Viability
(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay66 was completed
to estimate cell viability. The cells were plated in 96 well plates
and treated with or without different concentrations of TBOSBL1, TBOSBL2, and TBOSBL3 for 6 h. Then MTT
solution was added. Four hours after the addition of MTT, formazan
was solubilized with acidic isopropanol and the absorbance of the
solution was measured at 595 nm using an ELISA reader.

4.6 Quantification of Apoptosis Using Flow Cytometry
Apoptotic
and necrotic cell death was quantified using the annexin
V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit (Calbiochem, CA).67 Briefly, HCT-116 cells were pretreated with 5 μg/mL
of TBOSBL3 for different time durations (6 and 12 h).
After an appropriate time period, the cells were washed and stained
with PI and annexin V-FITC in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. The percentages of live, apoptotic (early and late),
and necrotic cells were quantified using a flow cytometer (BD LSRFortessa
TM San Jose, CA). The acquired data were analyzed.

4.7 Measurement of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen
Species (ROS) Generation Using Flow Cytometry
Intracellular
ROS accumulation was observed using DCFH-DA, which is a renowned ROS
marker. Briefly, TBOSBL3-treated cells were incubated
with 10 mM DCFH-DA at 37 °C for 25 min, and after that, the cells
were analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD LSRFortessa TM San Jose,
CA). The acquired data were analyzed.

4.8 Immunofluorescence
Confocal microscopy
has been accomplished for observing the expression of two apoptotic
markers p53 and p21. Briefly, control/treated HCT-116 cells were washed
twice for 10 min each in PBS (0.01 M) and incubated for 1 h in blocking
solution having 2% normal bovine serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS.
After blocking, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with
the respective primary antibody (p53 and p21), followed by washing
and incubation with respective fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies
(anti mouse/rabbit FITC and Alexa Fluor-647) for 2 h. The slides were
then counterstained with 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10
min and mounted with the ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probe,
Eugene, OR). Stained cells were examined using a confocal laser scanning
microscope (FV 10i, Olympus, Japan).

4.9 Caspase-3
and Caspase-9 Activity Assays
The treated cells were subjected
to caspase-3 and caspase-9 colorimetric
assay using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA) respectively.
