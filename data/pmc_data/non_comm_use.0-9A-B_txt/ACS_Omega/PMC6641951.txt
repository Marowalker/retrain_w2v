This
work aimed at investigating electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination
(ECH) mechanisms of chlorophenols (CPs) on a Pd-modified cathode.
Experiments on the ECH of 2,4-dichlorophenol were conducted under
extreme test conditions, i.e., with various buffer solutions and several
sodium salt solutions as supporting electrolytes. Buffer solutions
promote dechlorination due to their property of retarding the alkalinity
of a solution. ECH was found to be significantly inhibited by sulfite.
Experimental results showed that sulfite poisoning on Pd catalysts
was reversible. Protonation may account, at least in part, for the
observed high pH dependency of ECH, which proceeded rapidly, with
lower apparent activation energy (Ea)
in the acidic electrolyte. In addition, pH influenced the selectivity
of dechlorination of CPs. It was inferred that the ECH of CPs on the
Pd-modified electrode was a preactivated electrocatalytic reaction.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Chlorophenols
(CPs), as typical chlorinated organic compounds,
are important chemical materials and intermediates, which have been
widely used for the production of pesticide intermediates, pharmaceuticals,
drugs, and dyes. However, they are hazardous organic compounds. They
enter the environment through industrial waste, application of pesticides,
and degradation of complex chlorinated hydrocarbons. It is well known
that all the chlorinated organic compounds are toxic due to the chlorine
present in their structure.1−3 The general trend of enhanced
toxicity increases with chlorine atoms in its molecular structure.
The strong resistance of CPs to physical, chemical, and biological
treatments renders them hazardous to living organisms, including human
beings. CPs were listed as typical persistent organic pollutants.

The stable C–Cl bond in the molecular structure of CPs is
responsible for their toxicity and persistence. The selective removal
of chlorine atoms can reduce their toxicity, which makes further treatment
convenient and economical. Electrocatalytic hydrodechlorination (ECH),
an efficient method, has been employed in recent research due to its
rapid reaction rate, mild reaction conditions, and the absence of
secondary contaminants.4,5 It can be represented as the exchange
of chemisorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads),
which are generated on the electrode surface by the electrolysis of
water or hydrogen ions with chlorine atoms.6−10

There are two key steps in the ECH process:
(i) the Hads can be generated easily on
the metal catalyst surface
and (ii) the appropriate reaction occurs between the generated Hads and (R–Cl)ads. Therefore,
the metal catalyst must show good performance with respect to Hads evolution, with moderate adsorbability for Hads. The adsorption of Hads depends on the formation of the Me–H bond between
the hydrogen atoms and unpaired electrons in a metal. The higher the
d electron content, the fewer unpaired electrons exist in the metal
atoms, leading to weak Me–H bond formation. The relationship
between the Me–H bond strength and the exchange current density
of hydrogen evolution conform to the “volcano curve”.11,12 Palladium (Pd) presents appropriate Pd–H bond strength and
lower hydrogen evolution overpotential. Moreover, Pd has good adsorption
and absorption ability with respect to hydrogen.13,14 Hence, Pd has become the most studied catalyst for the ECH of chlorinated
organic compounds. It has been reported that Pt and Pd have similar
hydrogen evolution ability. However, the ECH activity of Pd is higher
than that of Pt. This is because, Pd can intercalate hydrogen in its
lattice, maintaining a higher surface hydrogen concentration.

Many studies on the Pd-modified cathode for the dechlorination
of chlorinated organic compounds have been reported.15−17 Of these, one main task is the development of an electrocatalytic
cathode with high activity and good stability. In our previous work,
Pd-loaded electrodes, modified with a polypyrrole (PPY) interlayer,
were prepared and employed for the dechlorination of CPs in aqueous
solution, which showed good stability and high activity.18−22

Mechanisms for the ECH of chlorinated organic compounds on
the
Pd-loaded electrode have been reported by researchers in the past.
Surface mechanisms were proposed for the hydrodehalogenation of 4-chlorophenol
(4-CP) on the Pd/graphite electrode.23 The
viewpoint of surface mechanisms suggests: (i) Hads is generated on the Pd surface, while Pd can adsorb the
hydrogen into its lattice to maintain a high surface concentration
of hydrogen; (ii) chlorinated organic compounds are adsorbed on the
electrode surface; and (iii) the hydrogenation reaction occurs at
the Pd island/electrode surface. Tsyganok et al studied the dechlorination
of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on the Pd-loaded carbon
felt cathode, which agreed with the surface mechanism.24 Yang et al proposed mechanisms for the ECH of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) using Pd/Ni foam as the cathode on
the basis of hydrogen diffusion processes.25Hads was generated on a polarized Pd
particle, subsequently being diffused to a less polarized Pd particle
nearby, due to the spillover on the Ni substrate. Diffusion processes
provide wider access to the total available surface, so that Hads can react with the PCBs adsorbed on the
surface, leading to the rapid conversion of PCBs on the Pd/Ni foam
electrode. The adsorption was sufficiently weak to allow some mobility
of PCBs to collide with Hads, while being
sufficiently strong to weaken the bonds to be dechlorinated.

Several studies found that the solution pH had a significant impact
on dechlorination.26−31 In addition, dechlorination was influenced by other environmental
factors such as co-existing ions in solution and the molecular structures
of CPs.

In this paper, we aimed at obtaining further details
on the ECH
process: (i) how does pH affect the ECH and (ii) what is the type
of electrode process for ECH. Therefore, the Pd-modified titanium
mesh sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS)-doped PPY interlayer
(Pd/PPY-SBDS/Ti) electrode,22 reported
in our previous work for pentachlorophenol dechlorination, was employed
for dechlorination experiments under specific conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Dechlorination of 2,4-Dichlorophenol
(DCP)
in Buffer Solutions
To further investigate the effect of
pH on ECH, five buffer solutions with a pH of 2.0, 4.5, 6.0, 7.0,
and 7.8 were selected as the supporting electrolyte for dechlorination.
The detailed components of buffer solutions are listed in Table S1. The electrocatalytic dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP was conducted separately in each buffer solution. Each
group of experiment was carried out at three constant currents of
3, 5, and 8 mA. To compare with the effects of the buffer solutions,
the dechlorination of 2,4-DCP with 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution as a background electrolyte was also provided. Figure 1 shows the results
of 2,4-DCP in the selected supporting electrolyte.

Figure 1 Removal of 2,4-DCP in
various buffer solutions, (a) pH 2.0, (b)
pH 4.5, (c) pH 6.0, (d) pH 7.0, (e) pH 7.8, and (f) in 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution.

As shown in Figure 1, similar removal results were obtained in the five buffer
solution
electrolytes. When the applied dechlorination current was 3 mA, the
lower removal of 2,4-DCP implied the occurrence of direct reductive
dechlorination. Direct reduction may occur due to electron tunneling
or by the formation of a chemisorption complex for organic compounds
with cathode materials.32,33 The conversion of 2,4-DCP
increased with the increase in the applied current and electrolysis
time. In all the five buffer solutions, conversion of 2,4-DCP on the
Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode reached over 95% within 70 min, with an applied
current of 5 or 8 mA. The higher reaction rate implied the occurrence
of indirect electroreduction.

The removal of 2,4-DCP in the
acidic buffer solutions (Figure 1a–c) was slightly
higher than that in neutral (Figure 1d) and alkaline buffer solutions (Figure 1e). Furthermore, when Na2SO4 was used as a background electrolyte, the removal
of 2,4-DCP using a current of 8 mA after 70 min of electrolysis was
approximately 70%, which was lower than that at 5 mA (Figure 1f). It can be summarized that
the alkaline environment was unfavorable for dechlorination.

Variations in the catholyte pH values before and after dechlorination
are summarized in Table 1. All the pH values of the catholyte containing various buffer solutions
increased to a certain extent after 70 min of electrolysis, although
the buffer solutions were employed to maintain the solution pH. The
variations in pH increased with the increase in applied dechlorination
currents.

and after Dechlorinationa

a Electrolysis time

Table 2 shows the
variations in the catholyte conductivity before and after dechlorination.
After 70 min of electrolysis, the conductivity of all five catholytes
showed an increasing tendency. The electrical conductivity increased
with the increase in the applied current. However, the changes in
all five buffer solutions were lower than that of the Na2SO4 supported electrolyte.

2.2 Effect of Common Anions on the Dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP
2.2.1 Dechlorination of 2,4-DCP in Electrolytes
Supporting Various Sodium Salts
To investigate the effect of common anions on dechlorination, six
sodium salts NaCl, NaNO3, Na3PO4,
Na2CO3, NaHCO3, and Na2SO3 were selected as the supporting electrolyte solutions
for dechlorination. Various amounts of these sodium salts were added
into the electrolyte solutions, to maintain the catholyte conductivity
with 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution at 9.0 mS m–1, in accordance with the conductivity curve (Figure S1). The dechlorination reactions of 2,4-DCP
with the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode in the six supporting electrolyte
solutions at a constant current of 5 mA are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Removal of 2,4-DCP with
various supporting electrolytes, (a) NaCl,
(b) NaNO3, (c) Na3PO4, (d) Na2CO3, (e) NaHCO3, and (f) Na2SO3, I = 5 mA.

As shown in Figure 2a–e, when the NaCl, NaNO3, Na3PO4, Na2CO3, and NaHCO3 solutions
were used as the supporting electrolytes, the removal of 2,4-DCP after
110 min of electrolysis showed minimal difference, which was similar
to that using 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution. This result
indicates that the influence of Cl–, NO3–, PO43–, CO32–, and HCO3– on the
dechlorination of 2,4-DCP was almost negligible. However, there is
nearly no removal of 2,4-DCP after 110 min of electrolysis in the
Na2SO3 solution, as shown in Figure 2f. It can be inferred that
the ECH reaction was inhibited by the existing SO32–.

2.2.2 Effect of Sulfite on
the Dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP
Dechlorination reactions of 2,4-DCP were conducted
separately under the supporting electrolyte conditions with Na2SO3 concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mM.
Various amounts of Na2SO4 were supplemented
to maintain the solution conductivity at 9.0 mS cm–1. Figure 3 shows the
dechlorination of 2,4-DCP in the supporting electrolyte containing
varying amounts of sulfite at a constant current of 5 mA. It was noted
that the concentration of sulfite significantly influenced 2,4-DCP
degradation. When the concentration of sulfite in the solution was
5.0 mM, dechlorination was completely prevented.

Figure 3 Effect of Na2SO3 concentration on the dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP, I = 5 mA.

To verify whether alkalinity influenced dechlorination, we
partly
replaced Na2SO4 by NaOH as the supporting electrolyte
at a conductivity of 9.0 mS cm–1. Figure 4 shows the dechlorination of
2,4-DCP with a Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode in the supporting electrolyte
containing NaOH at a concentration of 5.0, 15.0, 25.0, and 50.0 mM,
separately.

Figure 4 Effect of NaOH concentration on the dechlorination of 2,4-DCP, I = 5 mA.

More than 80% of 2,4-DCP
was converted after 110 min of electrolysis
when the NaOH concentration was 5.0 mM. The conversion of 2,4-DCP
decreased with the increase in the concentration of NaOH. However,
dechlorination was not completely suppressed even when the NaOH concentration
increased to 50.0 mM. According to the literature,34 Pd nanoparticle surfaces easily adsorb OH– in an alkaline solution. It was inferred that the presence of the
hydroxide ion inhibited the adsorption of 2,4-DCP on the Pd catalyst
surface, which was also harmful for the generation of active hydrogen.
Considering that the minimum concentration of NaOH was 5.0 mM, which
was the same as the maximum concentration of Na2SO3 in Figure 3, it was inferred that alkalinity was not the only limiting factor
for 2,4-DCP dechlorination when Na2SO3 existed.

2.3 Discussion of Sulfite Toxicity on Pd-Modified
Electrode
2.3.1 UV–Vis Spectroscopic Analysis
Figure 5 shows the
UV–vis spectra of samples during 2,4-DCP dechlorination in
Na2SO3 and Na2SO4 supporting
electrolytes with the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode at a current of 5 mA.
As shown in Figure 5a, the UV–vis spectra barely changed during 50 min of electrolysis
when the supporting electrolyte contained 5.0 mM Na2SO3, implying that dechlorination was prevented. On the other
hand, a decrease of 2,4-DCP and an increase of phenol could be observed
during the dechlorination process with Na2SO4 solution as the supporting electrolyte, as shown in Figure 5b. UV–vis spectra of
the target objects of Na2SO3, 2,4-DCP, and phenol
are shown in Figure S2.

Figure 5 UV–vis spectra
of the 2,4-DCP dechlorination process in
electrolyte supporting (a) Na2SO3 and (b) Na2SO4, I = 5 mA.

2.3.2 Reuse Experiment
To examine Pd
poisoning by sulfite, the aged Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode used in 0.05
M Na2SO3 solution was reused for dechlorination. Figure 6 shows the dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP on the reused Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode in 0.05 M Na2SO4, with a current of 5 mA. The conversion of
2,4-DCP was over 95% after 110 min of electrolysis, which was similar
to the as-prepared Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode. The aged Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti
electrode, employed in the sulfite-containing electrolyte, continued
to show electrocatalytic activity for dechlorination. In other words,
Pd catalyst poisoning by sulfite was reversible in this ECH system.

Figure 6 Dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP on used Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti in Na2SO3 solution, I = 5 mA.

2.3.3 Cyclic
Voltammetry (CV) Analysis
CV tests in 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution and 0.05
M Na2SO3 solution, with and without 2,4-DCP,
are shown in Figure S3. In the Na2SO4 solutions, the reduction peaks in the range of −0.2–0
V correspond to the PdO reduction, i.e., the oxygen desorption peak,
and the peaks in the range of −0.8–0.6 V correspond
to hydrogen adsorption. When 2,4-DCP was added, the two peaks became
smaller, which can be attributed to the adsorption of 2,4-DCP on the
Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode and electron transfer from the cathode to
2,4-DCP, suggesting the capture of Hads by 2,4-DCP.

The two CV curves in the Na2SO3-containing solutions, with and without 2,4-DCP, were very
similar, while being different from those in the Na2SO4 solutions. Both, hydrogen adsorption–desorption peaks
and oxygen absorption–stripping peaks weakened, implying that
ECH was inhibited.

2.3.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS) Analysis
XPS measurements were employed to investigate
the chemical composition
of the applied electrode. Figure 7a shows the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the as-prepared Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti
electrode, in which, the first pair of Pd signals, peak I (335.3 eV)
and peak II (340.7 eV), at lower binding energies were attributed
to the major spin–orbit split doublet, Pd 3d5/2 and
Pd 3d3/2 of Pd(0). The second pair of Pd signals of peak
III (Pd 3d5/2) and peak IV (Pd 3d3/2) appeared
at higher binding energy values, which can be attributed to Pd atoms
with lower charge density (Pd(II)). The dominant component was Pd(0),
with the result being similar to the previous literature.35,36

Figure 7 XPS
spectra of Pd 3d of the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode, (a) as-prepared
and (b) used in Na2SO3 solution.

Figure 7b shows
the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode that has been
used in the sulfite-containing electrolyte. A negligible change was
observed, compared to Figure 7a, implying that no chemical reaction occurred between sulfite
and Pd on the surface of the electrode. The complete XPS spectra of
the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode, before and after electrolysis in the
sulfite-containing electrolyte, labeled with the composition are shown
in Figure S4. The sulfur element was not
detected. The determined Fe could be potentially obtained from the
impurities in PdCl2. Pd poisoning by sulfur species in
chemical dechlorination using Pd-based catalysts has been reported,
such as Pd/Fe,37,38 Pd/Al2O3,39 and Pd/zeolite.40 Sulfite might have deactivated Pd by being chemisorbed
to the Pd sites and preventing their accessibility to halogenated
organic compounds.37,40 Pd catalyst deactivation was
not a result of sulfite reacting to produce reduced sulfur species
in the Pd-catalyzed trichloroethylene dechlorination system.

We detected the variations of sulfite concentration during the
electrolysis of 2,4-DCP in the sulfite-containing electrolyte. For
comparison, the adsorption of sulfite on the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode
was also conducted under no power supply condition. The sulfite concentration
decreased slightly with time in the electrolysis process, and it was
similar to that under the no power supply condition. Therefore, it
was speculated that the decrease in sulfite was caused by adsorption.
In other words, the sulfite was not further reduced under experimental
dechlorination conditions, as shown in Figure S5.

Although the ECH system was different from the nanoscale
Pd/Fe
system, in which the hydrogen supply resulted from iron corrosion,
in the ECH system, the Hads was generated
on the Pd-modified cathode by electrolysis of water or hydrogen ions. During sulfite-induced catalyst deactivation, it might be speculated
that sulfite occupied the Pd active sites and prevented the Hads generation.

2.4 Effect
of pH on Dechlorination
2.4.1 Potentiostatic Dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP
in Neutral and Acidic Solutions
Figure 8a shows the potentiostatic dechlorination
of 100 mg L–1 of 2,4-DCP on the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode
in 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution. The potential was
controlled at −0.9, −1.1, −1.2, and −1.4
V with Hg/Hg2SO4 as the reference electrode.
When the applied potential was −0.9 V, the concentration of
2,4-DCP was nearly constant, i.e., the ECH did not occur. Upon increasing
the potential to −1.1 V, the removal of 2,4-DCP increased with
time, implying that ECH occurred. However, the conversion of 2,4-DCP
was not significant after 110 min of electrolysis. Dechlorination
proceeded rapidly at a potential of −1.2 V. More than 99% of
2,4-DCP was converted after 110 min of electrolysis, indicating that
this potential was suitable under the experimental conditions. When
the potential increased to −1.4 V, dechlorination of 2,4-DCP
occurred rapidly in the first 20 min, subsequently slowing down. The
conversion of 2,4-DCP at 110 min was less than 60%. It was inferred
that when the potential was too negative, the larger current led to
the side reaction hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to prevent the
CP molecules from reaching the electrode surface. Moreover, the HER
caused the pH to increase, consequently inhibiting the ECH.

Figure 8 Dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP at (a) various constant potentials in
a neutral solution and (b) a constant potential of −0.8 V in
an acidic solution, initial pH 2.5.

Figure 8b
shows
the dechlorination of 2,4-DCP at a potential of −0.8 V in acidic
solutions with 0.05 M Na2SO4 as the supporting
electrolyte. The initial pH was adjusted to 2.5 by the addition of
H2SO4. It can be seen that dechlorination can
occur easily in an acidic medium, although the potential was lower
compared with the neutral and basic conditions. 2,4-DCP could be completely
converted within 50 min.

2.4.2 Apparent Activation Energy
of 2,4-DCP Dechlorination
in Neutral and Acidic Solutions
According to the experimental
result, the ECH of chlorophenol followed the pseudo-first order kinetics,
which was consistent with the literature.5,14 Dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP on the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode, with 0.05 M Na2SO4 as the supporting electrolyte, was carried out under
temperatures of 283, 293, 303, and 313 K, separately. The apparent
rate constants (kobs) of 2,4-DCP dechlorination
in the neutral solution with various temperatures are provided in Table 3. kobs was calculated by the decrease in concentration with
time during dechlorination, which was equal to the slope of linear
fitting line between ln C and t, as shown in Figure S6a. Then, according
to the Arrhenius equation (k = A  e–Ea/RT), an apparent activation energy (Ea) of 2,4-DCP dechlorination could be determined by the
linear plot of ln k with 1/T, as shown in Figure S7a. Therefore, Ea of 2,4-DCP dechlorination on the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti
electrode in a neutral solution was calculated to be 17.35 kJ mol–1.

Table 3 Apparent Rate Constant of 2,4-DCP
Dechlorination at Varying Temperatures in a Neutral Solution
temperature (K)	283	293	303	313	
kobs (10–2 min–1)	1.812	2.788	3.411	3.638	
Similarly, the dechlorination
of 2,4-DCP on the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti
electrode in an acidic electrolyte was conducted under the temperatures
of 283, 293, 303, and 313 K. The initial pH was adjusted to 2.5 by
the addition of H2SO4 into the Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte. The kobs of 2,4-DCP dechlorination in the acidic solution with various
temperatures are shown in Table 4. Linear plots of ln C–t and ln k–1/T for dechlorination in an acidic solution are shown in Figures S6b and S7b, respectively. The Ea of 2,4-DCP dechlorination on the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti
electrode in acid solution was calculated to be 14.74 kJ mol–1, which was smaller than that in a neutral solution.

kobs (10–2 min–1)	3.806	4.464	5.824	6.877	
2.4.3 Selectivity
of 2,4-DCP Dechlorination in
Basic and Acidic Solutions
Figure 9 shows the dechlorination products of 2,4-DCP
in the basic solution with the NaOH-containing supporting electrolyte
at a constant current of 5 mA. 2-CP was determined as the only other
intermediate product, whenever the concentration of NaOH was 5.0,
15.0, 25.0, and 50.0 mM. However, both, 2-CP and 4-CP, could be found
in the dechlorination of 2,4-DCP in an acidic electrolyte, as shown
in Figure 10. It can
be concluded that the acidity of the solution affected the selectivity
of dechlorination.

50 mM.

2.4.4 Analysis of the Effect
of pH on Dechlorination
According to the experimental results,
the ECH of CPs occurred
rapidly in the acidic solutions, while barely occurring in the neutral
and basic solutions. It was reported in the literature that the halogenated
phenols would be protonated,41 with rapid
reductive dechlorination being carried out under acidic conditions
due to the protonation of aromatic ring.42 It was inferred that the influence of pH on the dechlorination rate
is the potential result, at least with regard to the protonation of
the CP molecules in the acidic medium. The pKa values of the six DCP isomers are listed in the literature.43 Since the pKa value
of 2,4-DCP was 7.9, the ECH rate of 2,4-DCP in the weak alkaline buffer
solution BF5 was not significantly lower than the ECH rate in acidic
solutions. This was because the initial pH value of BF5 was 7.8, which
was lower than the pKa value.

Figure 11 shows the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the six DCP isomer solutions with varying pH.
With regard to the hydrolysis equilibrium constant (pKa), the pH values of the CP solutions were adjusted so
as to be lower than pKa, higher than pKa, and equal to pKa.

Figure 11 UV–vis spectra of DCP isomers, (a) 2,3-DCP, (b) 2,4-DCP,
(c) 2,5-DCP, (d) 2,6-DCP, (e) 3,4-DCP, and (f) 3,5-DCP in solutions
with various pH values.

Similar absorption features can be observed for the DCP isomers.
The characteristic absorption peak between 250 and 290 nm was assigned
to the benzene ring structure. Under alkaline conditions, the UV–vis
absorption spectra red shifted distinctly. However, the absorption
spectra showed a blue shift when the solution was acidic (<pKa). This could have been caused by the n−π*
electron transition, thus increasing the energy of the DCP molecules.

Figure 12 shows
the adsorption of 2,4-DCP on the PPY-SDBS/Ti and Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrodes
under a solution pH of 2.5 (<pKa),
11.0 (>pKa), and 7.9 (pKa), respectively. Moderate agitation was maintained without
power supply at room temperature. Adsorption of 2,4-DCP on the two
electrodes showed a similar tendency of being pH-dependent. The concentration
of 2,4-DCP barely changed at pH 11.0, while decreasing at pH 7.9 and
2.5. The lower pH led to the improvement of 2,4-DCP adsorption to
some extent, indicating that the acidic conditions can promote the
adsorption of 2,4-DCP on the electrode. This result was consistent
with the literature,44,45 which reported that the adsorption
of CPs on activated carbon increased with the decrease in pH. According
to the literature,46 the solubility of
2,4-DCP decreases with the decrease in pH. Generally, the lower the
solubility of organic matter in water, the larger its adsorption capacity.
Briefly, the adsorption capacity of 2,4-DCP increased under acidic
conditions. The adsorption of 2,4-DCP on the Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode
in 0.05 M Na2SO3 solutions was performed, the
concentration of 2,4-DCP barely changed (Figure S8), which was similar to that in the alkaline solution.

curves of 2,4-DCP on (a) PPY-SDBS/Ti and (b) Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti
in solutions with various pH values.

In summary, the removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP in several
buffer
solutions was superior to that in Na2SO4 solution.
The apparent activation energy of 2,4-DCP dechlorination on the prepared
Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode in acidic solutions was lower than that in
alkaline solution. The pH also influences the adsorption of CPs on
the electrode and the selectivity of dechlorination. It was inferred
that the ECH mechanism could be summarized as a preactivated electrocatalytic
reaction with activated adsorption and hydrogen spillover processes.
The proposed mechanisms for ECH of CPs on the Pd-modified electrode
are shown in Figure 13.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the efficiency of ECH dechlorination system was
further developed. We investigated the dechlorination mechanisms of
CPs by carrying out dechlorination under special conditions, such
as, in buffer solutions and sulfite-containing electrolytes. The effects
of pH on ECH were determined and discussed. The main findings are
as follows:1. The dechlorination rate of 2,4-DCP
in acidic buffer solutions was higher than that in alkaline buffer
solutions. It is suggested that the buffer solutions mitigate the
increase of alkalinity, making it beneficial for the ECH of CPs.

2. The ECH of CPs proceeded
easily under
acidic conditions, which was at least partially due to protonation.

3. The effect of cations on
ECH can be
divided into two categories. One class, including Cl–, NO3–, PO43–, CO32–, and HCO3–, showed no obvious effect, and another category, including SO32–, inhibited ECH significantly, causing
reversible catalyst poisoning on Pd catalysts.



4 Experimental Section
4.1 Experimental
Chemicals and Materials
Experimental chemicals, including
palladium chloride (PdCl2, 98%), pyrrole (≥98%);
chlorophenols, including 2,4-dichlorophenol
(2,4-DCP, >98%) and its structural isomer; and monochlorophenols,
were obtained from Aldrich Co. Deionized water (18.0 MΩ cm),
obtained from a Millipore-Q system, was used in all the experiments.

4.2 Experimental Methods
4.2.1 Batch
Dechlorination Experiments
Dechlorination experiments were
carried out in a two-compartment
cell separated by the cation-exchange membrane (Figure S9). The volume of electrolyte in each compartment
was 60 mL. The catholyte consisted of various supporting electrolytes
containing 100 mg L–1 of 2,4-DCP. The anolyte was
0.05 M Na2SO4 solution. The freshly prepared
Pd/PPY-SDBS/Ti electrode was used as the cathode, while a platinum
foil was used as the anode. Magnetic stirring was carried out at a
speed of 400 rpm to eliminate the effect of concentration polarization,
while the temperature for dechlorination reactions was maintained
at 298 K, except when the effect of temperature was examined. Constant
current for dechlorination was provided by constant voltage/current
power supply (Agilent U2722A). The potentiostatic dechlorination was
carried out on a potentiostat (Bio-Logic VMP3, France) with a three-electrode
system. The prepared electrode acted as a working electrode, while
the Pt foil acted as a counter electrode and Hg/Hg2SO4 was used as the reference electrode. Each experiment was
conducted three times and the average value was used for calculation.

4.2.2 Analysis Methods
The concentrations
of 2,4-DCP and its dechlorination products were detected by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters) equipped with a Waters 1525 binary
HPLC pump and a Waters 2487 dual λ absorbance detector. The
column employed was a reverse phase C18 column (250 mm × 4.6
mm i.d., 5 μm particle size, Atlantis T3). The mobile phase
was 30% water (containing 2% acetic acid) and 70% methanol, at a flow
rate of 0.8 mL min–1 and a detection wavelength
of 280 nm.

The pH and conductivity of the solution were measured
using a multipurpose water quality analyzer (WTW3420, Germany). The
XPS spectra were acquired using an ESCA Lab 250 (Thermo VG Scientific),
with 200 W Al Kα radiation in a twin anode. UV–vis spectrum
analysis was performed using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450,
Japan). The concentrations of sulfite were determined by iodimetry.
