Efficient enrichment glycoproteins/glycopeptides
from complex biological
solutions are very important in the biomedical sciences, in particular
biomarker research. In this work, the high hydrophilic polyethylenimine
conjugated polymaltose polymer brushes functionalized magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) denoted as Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose were designed and synthesized
via a simple two-step modification. The obtained superhydrophilic
Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs displayed
outstanding advantages in the enrichment of N-linked glycopeptides,
including high selectivity (1:100, mass ratios of HRP and bovine serum
albumin (BSA) digest), low detection limit (10 fmol), large binding
capacity (200 mg/g), and high enrichment recovery (above 85%). The
above-mentioned excellent performance of novel Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs was attributed to graft of
maltose polymer brushes and efficient assembly strategy. Moreover,
Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs were further
utilized to selectively enrich glycopeptides from human renal mesangial
cell (HRMC, 200 μg) tryptic digest, and 449 N-linked glycopeptides,
representing 323 different glycoproteins and 476 glycosylation sites,
were identified. It was expected that the as-synthesized Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs, possessing excellent
performance (high binding capacity, good selectivity, low detection
limit, high enrichment recovery, and easy magnetic separation) coupled
to a facile preparation procedure, have a huge potential in N-glycosylation
proteome analysis of complex biological samples.

==== Body
Introduction
Protein N-glycosylation,
as one of the most common and significant
post-translational modifications, plays an important role in biological
processes, such as cell signal transduction, protein folding, cell
recognition, etc.1−3 Aberrant protein N-glycosylation is frequently involved
in many major human diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), and infectious disease.4,5 Therefore,
the efficient isolation and identification of N-glycopeptides is especially
beneficial for understating their biological functions and for the
discovery of new clinical biomarkers and therapeutic drug targets.
Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful and effective tool
in proteomics which provides the possibility to analyze the N-glycoproteome.6−8 However, owing to the matrix complexity of biological samples, a
low abundance of glycoproteins, and severe ion signal suppression
of nonglycopeptides, it remains still an analytical challenge to comprehensively
characterize glycoproteins. Therefore, an effective enrichment of
glycopepetides prior to MS analysis becomes imperative to elucidate
the structures of glycans and clarify glycan-attached sites.

The common enrichment strategies based on glycan-specific recognition
or glycan physicochemical properties for glycosylated proteins/peptides,
including lectin affinity,9−12 hydrazide chemistry,13−15 boronic acid chemistry,16−21 and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC),22−25 have been developed. Among them, HILIC has aroused much attention
for glycopeptides enrichment by utilizing the strong hydrophilicity
of the glycopeptides and HILIC materials, due to its broad glycan
specificity, excellent reproducibility, and good MS compatibility.26,27 Until now, a number of HILIC nanomaterials have been synthesized
by introducing hydrophilic functional groups onto the surface of mesoporous
silica, graphene oxide, metal–organic frameworks, and magnetic
nanoparticles.28−35 In virtue of their strong magnetic responsibility, good biocompatibility,
easy and versatile modification, Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) based on magnetic separation has become an effective isolation
technique in proteomic research.36−38 The hydrophilic ligands,
immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles, would simultaneously achieve
fast separation and low loss of N-linked glycopeptides from a complex
sample under an external magnetic field. However, most of HILIC adsorbents
need tedious synthesis steps and harsh conditions to acquire the functional
moieties; this leads to relative low binding capacity and enrichment
selectivity. It has been reported that more hydrophilic functional
groups grafted on the surface of HILIC substrates lead to a better
performance of glycopeptides from the highly complex biosamples.23 Therefore, there is great demand to obtain ultrahydrophilic
nanocomposites with more functional groups by a facile synthesis procedure
for specific enrichment, especially for N-linked glycopeptide enrichment
in complex samples.

Herein, a new type of maltose-functionalized
hydrophilic magnetic
nanoparticles, Fe3O4–polyethylenimine–polymaltose
denoted as Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose,
was assembled by a facile strategy (Scheme 1). Briefly, PEI–coated magnetic Fe3O4 NPs were prepared by solvothermal reaction,
then succinic anhydride was reacted with the surface amino groups
of PEI. Maltose polymer brushes (Scheme S1, Supporting Information) were grafted on the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 NPs via an esterification reaction. The abundant
maltose on the surface of Fe3O4 NPs could specifically
enrich glycopeptides, and the magnetic core makes the NPs separate
easily from solution under an external magnetic field. In addition,
the hydrophilic polymer can provide low adsorption of nonglycopeptides,
which ensures the novel nanocomposite with high selectivity, sensitivity,
large binding capacity, and high recovery for N-glycopeptides enrichment.

Preparation of Fe3O4–PEI NPs
Fe3O4–PEI NPs
were synthesized by
the solvothermal method.34 Typically, 1.8
g of FeCl3·6H2O, 7.2 g of NaAc, and 1.8
g of PEI were dissolved in 90 mL of EG under sonication to give a
homogeneous solution which was then stirred mechanically for 30 min
at 60 °C. Then the resulting solution was poured into a autoclave
and reacted at 220 °C for 2 h. Deionized water alternates with
ethanol three times to wash the Fe3O4–PEI
NPs. Finally, the resulting Fe3O4–PEI
NPs were dried in vacuum oven.

Preparation of Fe3O4–PEI–COOH
NPs
The succinic anhydride (2.5 g) was added into the solution
of Fe3O4–PEI NPs (500 mg) in dry THF
(120 mL). The dispersion solution was refluxed for 12 h. The obtained
Fe3O4–PEI–COOH NPs were washed
several times using deionized water and ethanol and dried in vacuum
oven.

Synthesis of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs
The succinic anhydride (500 mg) was added into the THF
solution (22 mL) containing Fe3O4–PEI–COOH
NPs (100 mg). After ultrasonic dispersion uniformity, the solution
was reacted at 60 °C for 12 h. The activated Fe3O4–PEI–COOH NPs were washed with dry THF and were
dispersed in dry THF (120 mL) containing maltose polymer (Supporting Information, 200 mg) and Et3N (800 μL). After reaction at 60 °C for 4 h, the Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs were obtained.

Digestion of Proteins
Standard proteins (HRP, IgG,
and BSA) were digested according to the previous literature.33 Briefly, the proteins were dissolved in 50 mM
of NH4HCO3 solution and denatured by boiling
or 8 M urea. The denatured proteins were reduced with DTT and alkylated
by IAA in sequence. After emzymolysis with trypsin, the peptide solution
was frozen at −20 °C for standby application.

One
mg protein extraction from human renal mesangial cells (HRMC) was
precipitated by TCA. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mM of NH4HCO3. The proteins underwent reduction, alkylation,
and emzymolysis in sequence. The resulting digests were desalted and
enriched using Sep-pak C18 cartridges (Waters Ltd., Elstree, UK),
evaporated to dryness.

Isotope Dimethylation Labeling of Human IgG
Tryptic Digest
Stable isotope dimethyl labeling was performed
as the following
procedures: After the C18 StageTip desalting step, tryptic peptides
of IgG (100 μg) were dissolved in sodium acetate buffer (100
μL, 100 mM, pH 5–6), and then transferred in equal amount
into two tubes. The solutions (50 μL) were mixed with 8 μL
of CH2O (4%, v/v) or 8 μL of CD2O (4%,
v/v), which were labeled as light (L) and heavy (H), separately. After
a brief vortexing, 8 μL of NaBH3CN solution (0.6
M) in water was added to the L and H labeled samples, respectively.
The reactions were terminated with 8 μL of 4% ammonia solution
after shaking for 1 h.

Glycopeptides Enrichment under Hydrophilic
Mode
Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs (or Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH
NPs, 15 μg) was washed thrice with loading buffer (V(ACN)/V(H2O)/V(TFA)
= 92:7.9:0.1) and dispersed in the above buffer (400 μL) containing
a determined amount of standard protein digests. After being incubated
for 30 min, the NPs were washed thrice with the 400 μL loading
buffer. Finally, the N-glycopeptides captured by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs were released by elution buffer
(2 × 13 μL, V(ACN)/V(H2O)/V(TFA) = 30:69.9:0.1) for 6 min. The supernatant
was collected, lyophilized, redissolved in 4 μL of elution buffer
and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS.

For the glycopeptide enrichment
from human renal mesangial cells, 200 μg of the digests was
dissolved in 6 mL loading buffer (80% ACN/H2O, 0.1% FA),
incubated with 20 mg of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs for 1 h, and subsequently washed thrice with 2 mL of loading buffer.
Then, the trapped glycopeptides were eluted twice with 400 μL
of elution buffer for 30 min, and the elution was evaporated to dryness.
The obtained glycopeptides were redissolved in 10 mM NH4HCO3, and glycan moieties were removed by 1000 units of
PNGase F. The mixture was desalted and enriched using Sep-pak C18
cartridges (Waters Ltd., Elstree, UK), evaporated to dryness, and
redissolved prior to analysis by nano LC–MS/MS.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs
The
size and morphology
of obtained Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs were characterized by TEM and SEM.
As shown in Figure 1, after the modification of short chain carboxylic acid and maltose
polymer brush on the layer of Fe3O4–PEI
NPs with covalent bond, the corresponding NPs still exhibited good
dispersity and almost no changes in particle sizes. Also, from the
TEM image, the diameter of the resulting Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs was about 60–100 nm, which
is consistent with the hydrodynamic diameter by dynamic light scattering
technique (Figure S1). Because the maltose
polymer was prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)
in the presence of a mole ratio of 20:1 for maltose monomer and initiator
bis(2-bromoisobutyryl) hexanediamide (Supporting Information), the polymer lines of pMaltose are short, which
did not result in great size change of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs after immobilization on the surface
of magnetic Fe3O4–PEI NPs.

(c), NPs and SEM image of Fe3O4–PEI (d),
Fe3O4–PEI–COOH
(e), Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose (f) NPs,
respectively.

The zeta potentials of
Fe3O4–PEI,
Fe3O4–PEI–COOH and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs were monitored to further
demonstrate successful modification of Fe3O4 NPs. The zeta potentials of Fe3O4–PEI,
Fe3O4–PEI–COOH and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs were −25.54 ±1.23,
−33.51, ±1.31, and −19.00 ± 0.86 mV in alkaline
solution, respectively (Figure S2, Supporting Information). PEI and maltose polymer are cationic polyelectrolytes,
and carboxylic acid is an anionic electrolyte. Because of the cationic
PEI and maltose polymer, magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH)
had smaller negative potential than Fe3O4–PEI–COOH
modified with anionic carboxyl groups in alkaline condition (pH 10.5).

To further confirm the functionalization of magnetic Fe3O4 NPs, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry
was performed for Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH, and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs, respectively (Figure 2). In the spectrum of Figure 2a, the peaks at 585 and 440 cm–1 were ascribed to the stretching vibration Fe–O bond (Fe3+ bond and Fe2+ bond, respectively), which was
consistent with frequency bands of the spinel ferrite phase of Fe3O4 while the Fe–O band for γ-Fe2O3 is usually seen at 540 cm–1.39 The broad peak centered at 3428 cm–1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of N–H
and/or OH bonds. The peaks at 1622 and 1557 cm–1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the C=O bond
and deformation vibration of N–H of amide group, respectively.
Compared with the above spectrum of Fe3O4–PEI,
the new broad peak at 3448–2964 cm–1 of the
carboxyl group and the enhanced peak at 1557 cm–1 of the amide group in the spectrum of Fe3O4–PEI–COOH NPs (Figure 2b) revealed the successful modification of carboxyl
groups on the surface of Fe3O4–PEI. Meanwhile,
the disappearance of carboxyl groups (Figure 2c) indicated that the maltose polymer brushes
were grafted on the surface of the nanoparticles.

NPs.

The magnetic hysteresis curves
(Figure 3) indicated
that the nanomaterials (Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH,
and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose) possessed
nearly superparamagnetic properties with saturation magnetization
(Ms) of 48.25, 46.53, and 45.3 emu·g–1. The Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs can be easily separated within 10 s with an external magnetic
field (Figure 3 inset)
and quickly redispersed after removal of the magnetic field.

Identification of the crystalline phases of Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH
and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs was
performed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The characteristic diffraction
peaks of Fe3O4 (2θ = 30.0°, 35.4°,
43.1°, 53.4°, 57.0°, 62.6°) at the corresponding
2θ values were indexed as (220), (311), (400), (422), (511),
and (440), respectively, which were in accordance with that of standard
magnetite XRD pattern (JCPDS card, file No. 19-0629). Although the
XRD patterns of the products clearly exhibit the spinel structure,
it is difficult to distinguish the crystalline structure between Fe3O4 and the γ-Fe2O3 phase
only from the XRD patterns because of their similarity.40 The XPS technique was applied to character the
magnetic products because XPS is very sensitive to Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. The data of XPS (Figure 4a) of Fe3O4–PEI
NPs showed a C12 peak around 282.7 eV, O 1s peak at 530.6 eV, N 1s
peak at 398.5 eV, and Fe signals at about 56.6 eV for Fe 3p, 710.9
and 724.5 eV for Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 states, respectively (Figure 4b). The absence of
the satellite peaks on the magnifying pattern of Fe (2p) also confirmed
the formation of Fe3O4 rather than γ-Fe2O3,40−42 which was consistent with the results from the FT-IR
spectra.

The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of
Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH,
Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs are shown
in Figure 5. It can
be seen that 4.4% weight loss occurred for Fe3O4–PEI NPs (blue curve) corresponding to the content of PEI
onto the nanoparticles surface. And there was 9.5 and 13.4% weight
loss for Fe3O4–PEI–COOH, Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose, respectively. From
the data of TGA curves, the amount of maltose grafted onto the Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs was calculated
to 108.2 μmol·g–1.

Hydrophilicity of nanoparticles
is a key evaluation factor for
enrichment performance. Herein, the contact angle of prepared Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs were measured with the powder tabletting method. The contact angle
of Fe3O4–PEI and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs were 42.6° and 14.7°,
respectively (Figure 6). As expected, the angle distinctly decreased after modification,
indicating that Fe3O4 NPs functionalized polymer
maltose brush has superior hydrophilicity which could enhance the
enrichment effect.

and Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose (b) NPs.

Glycopeptide Enrichment
from Standard Proteins by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs
To manifest
enrichment based on the hydrophilic interaction between the hydrophilicity
of polymer maltose brush and targets, three synthetic nanoparticles
(Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH, Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs) were used to enrich the glycopeptides from the standard HRP tryptic
digest under the same conditions. Figure 7a shows the direct analysis of HRP digest
(100 fmol) without the enrichment procedure. The signal peaks of low
abundance of glycopeptides were completely suppressed, and no target
analyte was detected. After enrichment Fe3O4–PEI, Fe3O4–PEI–COOH,
Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs, and three
and five glycopeptides were distinctly identified and most abundant
nonglycopeptides were efficiently removed (Figure 7b–e). Detailed information on glycopeptides
enriched by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs from HRP tryptic digest is displayed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The greater number and
enhanced signal intensity of glycopeptides were observed for Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs in comparsion
with those for Fe3O4–PEI and Fe3O4–PEI–COOH. After the HRP tryptic digest
was adsorbed by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs, no glycopeptide peaks were found in the residual solution (Figure 7c). The results demonstrated
the good hydrophilicity Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs has as highly specific to glycopeptides.

with Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs; eluent

and (e) Fe3O4–PEI–COOH NPs. The
peaks of glycopeptides are marked with a red inverted triangle.

The detection limit of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs for N-glycopeptides enrichment was investigated with different
concentrations of HRP tryptic digest. As shown in Figure 8a, five target glycopeptides
with high signal intensity were identified when the concentration
of HRP digests was 50 fmol. Even when the concentration of HRP digests
was as low as 10 fmol, five target glycopeptides were still observed
(Figure 8b).

analysis of different concentrations of HRP tryptic
digests: (a) 50, (b) 10 fmol HRP after enrichment with Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs. The peaks of glycopeptides
are marked with a red inverted triangle.

To further evaluate the enrichment selectivity of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs between nonglycopeptides
and glycopeptides, the mixture of HRP and BSA tryptic digest with
different mass ratios was investigated. As shown in Figure 9, seven glycopeptides were
identified from tryptic BSA and HRP at ratios of 1:1 and 10:1 after
enrichment by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs. When the ratios were increased to 50:1 and 100:1, five glycopeptides
and four glycopeptides were still detected, respectively, albeit with
trace nonglycopeptide signals (Figure 9c,d). The results demonstrated that the Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs has great potential
for N-glycopeptides enrichment from complex biological samples.

The mass ratios of BSA/HRP are 1:1 (a), 10:1 (b), 50:1 (c), and 100:1
(d). The peaks of glycopeptides are marked with a red inverted triangle.

To demonstrated that Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs have no bias toward different kinds of glycans, tryptic IgG (20
pmol) which contains a different glycoform from HRP was employed.
Before enrichment, merely two glycopeptides were detected with low
peak intensities, and there existed a great number of interferences
from nonglycopeptides (Figure 10a). Seventeen high signal-to-noise glycopeptides were
obtained after enrichment by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs (Figure 10b, detailed
information is listed in Table S2, Supporting Information).The eluted glycopeptides were deglycosylated by
PNGaseF, and two strong signals of deglycosylated peptides were detected
(Figure 10c).

analysis (a), after enrichment with Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs (b), and deglycosylation by PNGase F (c). The peaks of glycopeptides
are marked with a blue inverted triangle.

Evaluation of Binding Capacity of Fe3O4-DA-Maltose
NPs for Glycopeptide
Different amounts (5–30
μg) of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs were used to treat 3 μg of IgG digest. The elution was analyzed
by MALDI-TOF MS. When the peak intensity of representative glycopeptides
reached maximum, the total amount of glycopeptides were bonded onto
the NPs. The binding capacity was calculated by 3 μg IgG digest
to NPs. As shown in Figure 11, the N-glycopeptides from 3 μg IgG digest were captured
by 15 μg of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs, therefore the binding capacity of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs for N-glycopeptides was about 200
mg g–1, which greatly exceeded the binding capacity
of other maltose functionalized Fe3O4 materials
such as Fe3O4@SiO2@PEG-Maltose,23−26 Fe3O4-DA-Maltose,33 and Fe3O4-PEI-Maltose,34 NPs.

The Reusability and Stability
of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs
To evaluate the reusability
and stability, Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs placed for two month at room temperature were applied to enrich
standard HRP glycopeptides from tryptic digest in consecutive times.
As shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), the N-linked glycopeptides were clearly detected in the first
time and sixth time run, indicating that as-prepared Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs owned excellent repeatability
and long-term stability for N-linked glycopeptides enrichment.

Enrichment
Recovery of Glycopeptides by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs
The stable-isotope
dimethyl labeling samples were used to study the enrichment recovery
of Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs for
glycopeptides. Briefly, the heavy-tagged tryptic digest was enriched
with Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs, and
then the eluted N-glycopeptides were mixed up with the light-tagged
tryptic digest. The mixed dimethyl labeling samples were enriched
with Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs, followed
with elution, deglycosylation by PNGaseF, and MALDI-TOF analysis.
The recovery yield (H/L) was calculated by the peak intensity ratio
of heavy isotope-labeled peptides to the corresponding light isotope-labeled
peptides. Meanwhile, the recovery yield (L/H) was also evaluated (Figure
S5, Table S3, Supporting Information).
The recovery yields (L/H or H/L) of two deglycosylated stable-isotope
dimethyl labeling peptides (m/z =
1186.0, 1218.0 or 1190.1, 1222.1) were about 89% or 85%, respectively,
which confirmed that Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs have great potential for N-glycopeptides enrichment.

Enrichment from Human Renal Mesangial Cell (HRMC)
Tryptic Digest by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs
Human renal mesangial cells serve as a filtration barrier
of the kidney. The injury of mesangial cells could cause diabetic
nephropathy, leading end-stage renal disease. Emerging evidence indicates
that mesangial cells can be damaged by high glucose, however the mechanism
is unclear. Given such outstanding performance in standard glycopeptides
enrichment, Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
NPs were applied to enrich glycopeptides from human renal mesangial
cell tryptic digest, treated with high glucose, and followed by LC–MS/MS
analysis (cell culture, protein extraction, MS/MS data analysis, see Supporting Information). Followed by the Uniprot-Human
protein sequence database for analysis, 449 N-linked glycopeptides,
representing 323 different glycoproteins and 476 glycosylation sites
were identified. The number of proteins and glycosylation sites detected
extremely exceeded those of our previous Fe3O4-DA-Maltose NPs.33 Detailed information
on glycan structures of human renal mesangial cells after enrichment
by Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs is listed
in Table S4 (Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In summary, novel polymer maltose brushes-interspersed
Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs) were synthesized successfully
via
a facile two-step method for selective enrichment of N-glycopeptides.
On the basis of its good biocompatibility, excellent hydrophilicity,
and magnetic responsibility, Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose
functionalized with a hyperbranched PEI structure and high maltose
polymer chains loading exhibited distinctly improved selectivity,
sensitivity, large binding capacity, and good recovery for HRP and
IgG digests. A total of 449 N-linked glycopeptides, representing 323
different glycoproteins and 476 glycosylation sites were found from
human renal mesangial cell tryptic digest. It can be expected that
the Fe3O4–PEI–pMaltose NPs would
hold great potential in N-glycoproteome research.
