Lankacidin C, which is an antibiotic
produced by the organism Streptomyces rochei, shows considerable antitumor
activity. The mechanism of its antitumor activity remained elusive
for decades until it was recently shown to overstabilize microtubules
by binding at the taxol binding site of tubulin, causing mitotic arrest
followed by apoptosis. However, the exact binding mode of lankacidin
C inside the tubulin binding pocket remains unknown, an issue that
impedes proper structure-based design, modification, and optimization
of the drug. Here, we have used computational methods to predict the
most likely binding mode of lankacidin C to tubulin. We employed ensemble-based
docking in different software packages, supplemented with molecular
dynamics simulation and subsequent binding-energy prediction. The
molecular dynamics simulations performed on lankacidin C were collectively
1.1 μs long. Also, a multiple-trajectory approach was performed
to assess the stability of different potential binding modes. The
identified binding mode could serve as an ideal starting point for
structural modification and optimization of lankacidin C to enhance
its affinity to the tubulin binding site and therefore improve its
antitumor activity.

1 Introduction
Lankacidin
C is the parent of a group of antibiotics (T2636) that
are produced by the soil-dwelling bacteria Streptomyces
rochei. This group of antibiotics was first isolated
in 1969 by Harada and co-workers,1 and
full characterization of the group was achieved a few years later.2−5 Lankacidin C, Figure 1a, possesses the structure of a 17-membered macrocyclic polyketide
and was found to have strong antimicrobial activity against various
Gram-positive bacteria, some of which are resistant to macrolide antibiotics.6 The antimicrobial activity of lankacidin C was
found to be due to interference with peptide bond formation during
bacterial protein synthesis by binding at the peptidyl transferase
center of the eubacterial large ribosomal subunit.7,8 Interest
in lankacidin C has grown recently, and several studies have been
conducted with the aim of facilitating its synthesis and large-scale
production.9−11

Figure 1 Structure of (a) lankacidin C and (b) dictyostatin.

Lankacidin C and various derivatives
also displayed considerable
in vivo antitumor activity against various tumor models such as 6C3
HED/OG lymphosarcoma, L1210 leukemia, and B16 melanoma,12,13 in addition to T47D breast cancer cell lines.14 However, the mechanism of lankacidin C antitumor activity
remained unclear and was usually confused with its mechanism of antimicrobial
activity, until we recently identified the mechanism. The mechanism
of action was predicted based on some computational simulations involving
compounds structurally very similar to lankacidin C.15 In our recent work,14 we have
shown that the mechanism of lankacidin C antitumor activity is due
to binding at the taxol binding site of tubulin, which causes overstabilization
of cellular microtubules constituting the mitotic spindle. This freezes
the dividing cell at the metaphase, resulting in mitotic arrest followed
by apoptosis.

Despite identifying the antitumor mechanism of
action and the tubulin
binding site of lankacidin C, it is still unknown how lankacidin C
binds at the taxol binding site. X-ray crystallographic studies managed
to identify the binding mode of lankacidin C to the eubacterial large
ribosomal subunit associated with its antimicrobial activity.7,8 However, the binding mode of lankacidin C to the taxol binding site
of tubulin, associated with its antitumor activity, remains unknown.
We have previously done some computational simulations on lankacidin
C and related analogues, and some preliminary data on the binding
mode were available.14,15 Nevertheless, a comprehensive
study on the binding mode of lankacidin C to tubulin was never performed.
In this study, we utilize cutting-edge computational techniques to
identify the binding mode of lankacidin C in the taxol binding site
of tubulin. We employ several ensemble-based docking experiments,
utilizing different computer software, to identify several potential
binding modes. The study is then supplemented with single and parallel
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (totaling 1.1 μs) and binding-energy
calculations to assess the various predicted binding modes and identify
the most likely one. The ensemble-based docking protocol is capable
of partially including receptor flexibility, whereas molecular dynamics
simulations can thereafter allow full receptor flexibility. This approach
was necessary since the taxol binding site shows a great deal of induced
fit and the binding pocket can take several different shapes to accommodate
a variety of structurally diverse drugs, such as paclitaxel, discodermolide,
epothilone A, and dictyostatin. Figure 2 shows the different shapes adopted by the taxol binding
pocket while hosting those different ligands. It also shows a root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) matrix quantifying the structural differences between
the shapes of the binding pockets in each case. Excluding the decent
similarity between the binding pockets of 5MF4 and 5LXT (RMSD < 2.0 Å), the shapes of
the binding pockets are significantly different with RMSD values >2.0
Å. Furthermore, we applied the same protocol outlined in this
study to predict the binding mode of dictyostatin (Figure 1b), whose experimental binding
mode is available through X-ray crystallography (Protein Data Bank
(PDB) ID: 5MF4). We used this as a proof of concept to validate our protocol.

binding site of tubulin shows a great deal of induced fit,
posing a real challenge in docking of new ligands. (a) Binding pocket

Finding out the correct binding
pose of lankacidin C in the taxol
binding site should be of great importance and shall serve as an excellent
starting point for structure-based design of lankacidin C. After the
correct binding mode of lankacidin C is established, the interactions
inside the binding pocket can be thoroughly studied and informed decisions
regarding structural modifications can be made. Such modifications
can be made to optimally exploit the binding cavity on the road to
tailor-design derivatives that should have better antitumor activity
than the parent lankacidin C.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Ensemble-Based Docking
In this part,
we docked different lankacidin C conformers into a set of four different
conformations of the taxol binding pocket of tubulin using GOLD and
FRED docking software. Tubulin structures were obtained from 1TVK (tubulin bound to
epothilone A), 5MF4 (tubulin bound to dictyostatin), 5LXT (tubulin bound to discodermolide) and 3J6G (tubulin bound to
paclitaxel), all of which are available on the Protein Data Bank.
This helps capture the binding site flexibility and account for induced
fit.

The ensemble-based docking returned a list of potential
binding modes that were ranked according to their scores, as shown
in Table 1. We selected
a set of representative binding modes from each docking protocol.
In the case of GOLD docking, the results of the ensemble-based docking
from all protein conformations were compiled together and the best-ranked
docking poses were visually compared. The poses were narrowed down
to the first four unique binding modes. In the case of lankacidin
C, those four unique binding modes were named GOLD1, GOLD3, GOLD6,
and GOLD12, each of which represents a specific lankacidin C conformation
and orientation inside a specific protein conformation. These binding
modes are numbered according to their scoring ranks. It was found
that all of these poses came from the protein conformation in 1TVK. In the case of
FRED docking, each of the four docking runs was treated separately.
The poses from each run, i.e., against each protein conformation,
were ranked separately, and the best-scoring pose was selected. The
reason we did this is that GOLD docking returned all of the best results
from the 1TVK protein conformation. Therefore, in the FRED docking, we wanted
to make sure that we take the best pose from each of the different
protein conformations to make sure we cover all of the available protein
conformational space in our analysis. The four binding modes resulting
from FRED run were ranked according to their Chemgauss4 score as listed
in Table 1. From the
results of docking, the binding modes GOLD1 and FRED1 are the highest-ranked
binding modes according to the two different docking algorithms. Therefore,
one of these two modes is likely to be the correct binding mode. This
hypothesis will be tested in the next sections. Figure 3a shows each of the eight different binding
modes identified in the ensemble-based docking runs. The figure shows
how the orientation of the ligand can sometimes be completely different
as some of the poses are 180° flipped with respect to the others. Figure 4a shows a matrix
of the RMSD of the ligand heavy atoms between the eight different
binding modes after fitting the atoms in the binding pocket. The matrix
shows that some modes are similar, whereas others are completely different.
Most of the modes obtained from GOLD are significantly different with
many RMSD values significantly greater than 2.0 Å. This is expected
since these modes were carefully selected from the top-scoring poses
to maximize diversity and uniqueness. Other modes, especially those
obtained from FRED, are relatively more similar since pose diversity
was not the factor in choosing them, rather receptor conformation
diversity. Examining the results of the ensemble-based docking of
dictyostatin presented in Table 1, we can see that GOLD and FRED protocols similarly
returned four binding modes each. The best mode in GOLD docking, GOLD1,
was bound to the receptor conformation coming from 5MF4, whereas in the
case of FRED docking, it came from the receptor conformation in 5LXT. Since the native
crystal structure of dictyostatin is indeed found in 5MF4, the GOLD docking
protocol seems to have performed better this time. The binding modes
are all shown in Figure 3b, and an RMSD matrix is shown in Figure 4b. Comparing all of the binding modes to
the native crystal structure of dictyostatin bound to tubulin, it
is clear that the GOLD1 binding mode is the closest one to the native
structure. The GOLD1 binding mode is shown overlaid to the native
crystal structure in Figure 3b. On the other hand, the RMSD matrix in Figure 4b shows that GOLD1 is only
1.14 Å different from the native binding mode, whereas all other
binding modes are at least 4.82 Å different. In short, these
findings manifest the ability of our docking protocol to find the
correct binding mode of dictyostatin.

Despite the good performance of the docking protocol
in the case
of dictyostatin, most of the time the results of docking and scoring
are questionable even when ensemble-based docking is performed. This
is because to assess the binding mode correctly, both the ligand and
the protein have to be completely free to explore different conformations
in the bound state. In addition, the binding energy (BE) between the
two entities should be calculated as an ensemble average or a time
average taking into account all of the conformations explored by the
bound ligand–protein complex in comparison to the free ligand
and protein. Equation 1 shows how the ensemble average of a property A, in
our case it is the energy, which is a function of positions (q) and momenta (p), is calculated. In this case,
the Boltzmann factor (e–E(p,q)/kT) is used as a weighting
factor, where E is the energy of the microstate, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
temperature in kelvin. The integration is done over the entire phase
space. 1  The time average of property A can also be calculated according to eq 2, where the positions and momenta are now
functions
of time, which extends from zero to ∞. 2  The ergodic hypothesis
maintains that in ergodic
systems, the ensemble average is equal to the time average as demonstrated
in eq 3. This is where
molecular dynamics comes into play where the system is simulated for
a finite period of time hoping that this simulation will capture the
most important microstates of the system. After that, a representative
set of microstates M (i.e., conformations of the
bound complex) is used to approximate the time average of property A as shown in eq 3.20 3  In our case, the
property we are interested
in is the potential energy of the system. The binding energy will
be calculated as the difference between the average energy of the
complex and the average energies of the ligand and receptor, as shown
in eq 4. 4  For this reason,
molecular dynamics simulation
is necessary to generate a set of representative conformations of
the ligand–protein complex, which can be used to assess the
stability of the complex and more importantly to re-evaluate the scores
of each of the eight binding modes obtained from the docking experiment.

2.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Molecular
dynamics simulations were performed for the eight ligand–protein
complexes representing the eight different binding modes identified
in the docking steps. The stability of the protein (tubulin), as well
as that of the ligand (lankacidin C) in the binding site, was assessed
by following the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) change over the
course of the simulation time as shown in Figure 5a. The RMSD was measured after least-square
fitting of the Cα atoms of the protein to that of
the initial structure before the simulations. The figure shows that
the RMSD of the protein (black lines) is stable for most of the complexes,
ranging from 2.0 to 3.0 Å. The most stable protein among all
of the complexes is the protein in the FRED1 binding mode where the
RMSD of the protein is stabilized early in the simulation with very
little fluctuations all around an average RMSD value of 1.3 Å.
This means that for FRED1 binding mode, the protein stays for the
whole 50 ns of the simulation in a conformation very close to the
starting conformation obtained from 5LXT. Having an RMSD of less than 2.0 Å
usually means that the conformation is almost unchanged.

Figure 5 RMSD change
over the course of the simulation for the different
binding modes of (a) lankacidin C and (b) dictyostatin. The black
lines represent the RMSD of the Cα atoms of the protein.
The red lines (usually higher in the plots) represent the RMSD of
the ligand atoms. All RMSD values were obtained after least-square
fitting of the Cα atoms of the protein and with respect
to the initial structure before the simulations.

Analyzing the change in RMSD of the ligand in Figure 5a, we find large values of
RMSD as well as large fluctuations in the case of GOLD12, FRED3, FRED4,
FRED2, GOLD3, and GOLD1 binding modes. The large values of RMSD (>2.0
Å) indicate that the binding mode of the ligand has changed over
the course of the simulation time and it no longer resembles the initial
binding mode. Not only are the values of RMSD large, but there are
also large fluctuations in the values of RMSD over the course of the
50 ns of the simulation indicating that the ligand cannot attain a
stable orientation in the binding pocket. The ligand is stuck oscillating
in the middle of some unfavorable orientations that cannot be easily
changed to a favorable one due to the presence of high energy barriers.
Therefore, it is unlikely that any of the six aforementioned modes
will be the correct binding mode. For the two remaining modes, namely,
FRED1 and GOLD6, the case is different. The RMSD fluctuations are
small and the values are all around 2.0 Å, indicating that the
ligand is stable in this binding mode and that the initial binding
mode before the simulation is nearly conserved. The FRED1 binding
mode is even more stable. Despite some fluctuations in the first 8
ns, the ligand remains around an RMSD value of nearly 1.2 Å until
the end of the simulation, in contrast to an average value of 2.4
Å for GOLD6. This means that during the first 8 ns, the ligand
and the protein in the FRED1 binding mode were slightly rearranged
in space to accommodate each other better. After that, the ligand
remained in an essentially unchanged orientation, very similar to
the starting orientation, for the remaining 42 ns of the simulation.
This is another evidence increasing the likelihood that FRED1 is the
correct binding mode of lankacidin C to tubulin, despite the GOLD6
binding mode being a strong competitor.

Analyzing the RMSD plots
of dictyostatin–tubulin complexes
shown in Figure 5b,
we can similarly rule out GOLD4, FRED1, FRED2, and FRED4. They are
very unlikely to be the correct binding modes amid the instability
reflected through their RMSD plots. To a lesser extent, GOLD3 and
GOLD2 also are unlikely to be the correct binding modes since their
ligand RMSD values are greater than 2.0 Å, and less but significant
fluctuations can also be seen. We are left with GOLD1 and FRED3 binding
modes, where the RMSD of both the ligand and the protein reflects
a great deal of stability. In the case of GOLD1, the average value
of ligand RMSD after the first 10 ns is 1.6 Å, versus 2.0 Å
in case of FRED3. Indeed, the GOLD1 binding mode is the most stable
among the eight proposed binding modes, which agrees with the fact
that it is the correct binding mode. Once again, this strongly supports
our approach in this study and highlights the reliability of using
RMSD as a measure of binding mode stability and likelihood of being
the correct one.

A hydrogen bond analysis was done to study
the hydrogen bonds between
lankacidin C and the protein along the 50 ns simulation trajectory
of each of the eight complexes. The results are presented in Figure 6. The frequency of
the hydrogen bonds over the simulation time as shown in the figure
can indicate that the binding modes FRED3, FRED4, and GOLD1 are unlikely
to be the correct binding modes due to the low frequency of hydrogen
bonds. Other modes such as GOLD12, FRED2, FRED1, GOLD6, and GOLD3
have higher hydrogen bond frequencies, and one of them is more likely
to be the correct binding mode. It is worth mentioning that the frequency
of hydrogen bonds alone, without considering the strength of each
bond, is not enough measure for the strength of binding since few
strong hydrogen bonds can make a bigger contribution to binding than
many weak hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the results of this analysis
can only be taken as a rough estimation. A deeper analysis of the
binding energy can be achieved with molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations.

and the protein along the 50 ns trajectories of the eight complexes.
The x axis shows the frame number at a density of
100 frames/ns. The numbers to the right of each plot represent the
persistence percentage of single, double, and triple hydrogen bonds
(bottom to top) over the entire simulation time.

2.3 MM/PBSA Binding-Energy Calculations
The binding energy was estimated using the MM/PBSA method, which
takes into account contributions due to van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic
interactions (ele) (utilizing molecular mechanics, MM), polar solvation
(PS) energy (utilizing Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) method), and
nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area energy (utilizing a surface
area term, SA). This, however, does not take into account the contributions
due to rotational, translational, or vibrational entropy. Since in
our study we are comparing the same ligand bound to the same protein
but only in different binding modes, the entropic contributions are
not expected to be much different between different binding modes.
This is why the costly entropic calculations via normal mode analysis
were not necessary and we depended on MM/PBSA alone to compare the
different binding modes.

The results of MM/PBSA and its different
contributions in the eight different binding modes of lankacidin C
are shown in Table 2. As expected, the list is topped by the FRED1 binding mode with
an average binding energy of −99 kJ/mol over the course of
the trajectory. An equal binding energy was also reported for FRED2
binding mode. All of the remaining binding modes have significantly
weaker binding than the first two with the third-ranking mode, GOLD1,
being statistically lower than the first two in a confidence interval
greater than 99%. Most of that difference in binding energy comes
from van der Waals interactions and polar solvation energy. With regards
to dictyostatin, Table 2 shows that the GOLD1 binding mode is at the top of the list with
an average binding energy of −154 kJ/mol. Thus, the binding
in the case of the GOLD1 binding mode is significantly stronger than
the binding in the case of all of the other binding modes. This is
in line with all of the previous findings that GOLD1 is the most stable
binding mode besides being the native binding mode found in the experimental
structure. In turn, it is another evidence boosting the reliability
of the protocol used in this study. In addition, upon comparing the
binding energy of the best-scoring binding mode of dictyostatin (−154
kJ/mol) and the best-scoring binding mode of lankacidin C (−99
kJ/mol), we find that the results agree very well with experimental
data. The IC50 of the cytotoxic activity of dictyostatin
lies in the nanomolar range,19 whereas
that of lankacidin C lies in the micromolar range.14 Both our estimates of the binding energies and the experimental
values of IC50 reflect that dictyostatin has a cytotoxicity
that is orders of magnitude stronger than that of lankacidin C.

2.4 Multiple-Trajectory Approach
To evade
the risks that emerge from relying on a single molecular dynamics
simulation, we ran a multiple-trajectory analysis to further assess
the stability of the binding modes. In the multiple-trajectory simulations,
five different parallel molecular dynamics runs were carried out for
each of the eight binding modes of lankacidin C, each of the runs
was 10 ns long. Each of the five parallel runs starts with a different
velocity distribution, and hence the trajectories should be uncorrelated.
Thus, we rule out the possibility that a single trajectory may be
stable simply because of a specific favorable initial velocity distribution,
or vice versa. As outlined in the methods section, a certain binding
mode would be judged as a stable binding mode if at least one of the
five parallel runs achieved an average ligand RMSD value <2.0 Å
relative to the starting structure before the simulation. This criterion,
as well as the entire method, was tested and validated recently.21,22 The average RMSD values for all of the runs are listed in Table 3. As the table shows,
the only binding mode that attained an average RMSD value of <2.0
Å at least once is FRED1. In fact, not only one but two out of
the five parallel simulations, namely, MD1 and MD2, satisfied this
stability criterion. Therefore, it is the most likely binding mode
compared to the others. All other binding modes did not satisfy this
stability criterion, which indicates the very low likelihood that
any of them could be the correct binding mode. Table 3, however, also shows that the MD3, MD4,
and MD5 runs of the FRED1 binding mode did not satisfy our stability
criterion. This behavior is acceptable due to the fact that each simulation
run possibly explores a different region of the molecular dynamics
phase space trajectory. Therefore, one should not expect every simulation
run to achieve perfect stability, which does not happen even in real
life as the ligand dynamically associates and then dissociates from
the receptor. This is why the parallel molecular dynamics approach
is preferable for such investigations and that is why our criteria
for stability only required a minimum of one of the five simulations
to achieve stability, as similarly argued by Liu and Kokubo.21,22 Nevertheless, we wanted to investigate what could happen if we extend
the five simulations of FRED1 to about 40 ns and measure the average
RMSD in the last 10 ns of the simulation. We also did the same to
the GOLD6 binding mode, which was the strongest competitor to FRED1
based on the previous RMSD analysis (see Figure 5). The results of the extended simulations
indicated that for FRED1, the average RMSD values for both MD1 and
MD2 remained below 2.0 Å, with values of 1.7 and 1.1 Å,
respectively. MD5 also attained an average RMSD value of 1.0 Å
early after the first 15 ns of the simulation. Therefore, three of
the five extended runs meet our stability criterion. The average RMSD
value of the MD3 run considerably declined from 5.6 Å to nearly
2.2 Å, but this does not meet our stability criterion. On the
other hand, the average RMSD value of MD4 remained around 5.4 Å
and never went down below 2.0 Å. For the GOLD6 binding mode,
the average RMSD values of all of the five extended simulation runs
remained above the cutoff of 2.0 Å, the lowest of which was the
MD5 run, which had an average RMSD value slightly above 2.0 Å.
The other four runs had average RMSD values ranging from 2.5 to 7.4
Å. Therefore, three out of the five extended runs for FRED1 showed
adequate stability, whereas none of the five runs for GOLD6 met the
preset stability criterion.

Given those findings, the FRED1
binding mode emerges as the most
likely binding mode of lankacidin C in the taxol binding site. This
mode showed a high score in docking, demonstrated a great deal of
stability in RMSD analysis, performed decently in hydrogen bond analysis,
and most importantly achieved the highest score in the MM/PBSA calculations
as well as the multiple-trajectory approach. Despite the high score
of the FRED2 binding mode of lankacidin C in the MM/PBSA analysis,
its relatively poor performance in the RMSD analysis and the multiple-trajectory
approach makes it less likely to be the correct binding mode due to
the considerable instability of the ligand in its binding pocket.
In addition, although GOLD6 performed well in RMSD analysis, its poor
score in the MM/PBSA analysis and the multiple-trajectory approach
makes it unlikely to be the correct binding mode. It is interesting
to mention that the FRED1 binding mode of lankacidin C identified
in this study is significantly different from the preliminary binding
mode that was previously proposed14,15 but never
tested thoroughly, and this is part of the reason why this study was
conducted.

Visual analysis of the FRED1 binding mode, see the Supporting Information for an animation of the
entire trajectory, reveals a ligand that is very stable in its binding
pocket, very well buried inside the pocket with strong persistent
interactions with nearby residues as was shown in the hydrogen bond
analysis. Figure 7 shows
the binding interactions of lankacidin C in the FRED1 binding mode
as well as dictyostatin in the native binding mode inside the taxol
binding site of tubulin. The figure shows that lankacidin C makes
hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asp226 and the backbones of
Thr276 and His229, whereas dictyostatin makes hydrogen bonds with
the backbones of Thr276, Gln282, and Pro274.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we have identified the most likely binding mode
of lankacidin C in the taxol binding site of tubulin utilizing computational
techniques. Eight different binding modes were proposed based on an
ensemble-based docking experiment, which partially takes the receptor
flexibility into account. After that, a molecular dynamics simulation
was performed to assess the stability of each of the eight binding
modes, allowing for full protein and ligand flexibility. RMSD analysis
revealed that the FRED1 binding mode was the most stable among the
binding modes. Hydrogen bond analysis showed that the FRED1 binding
mode shows up on top of the list of hydrogen bond frequencies, despite
being competed with GOLD12 and FRED2, both of which have already been
ruled out due to instability in RMSD analysis. MM/PBSA binding-energy
calculations revealed that the FRED1 binding mode is the best-scoring
mode in terms of binding energy. Multiple-trajectory approach revealed
that only the FRED1 binding mode met the required criterion for stability.
Overall, the results indicate that the FRED1 binding mode is the most
likely one among the eight studied binding modes. The coordinates
of the FRED1 complex are available in the Supporting Information. The inclusion of dictyostatin in the study served
as a benchmark for validating the reliability of the method for binding
mode prediction. This study, however, needs to be confirmed through
experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, which is part
of our future plans. Upon establishing the binding mode of lankacidin
C to the taxol binding site, structure-based design techniques can
immediately be applied to optimize the binding of lankacidin C to
tubulin and improve its antitumor activity to compete with other antitumor
drugs available in the market.

4 Experimental Section
This study was performed in four consecutive steps. First, an ensemble-based
docking was performed to identify a group of potential binding modes
of lankacidin C in the taxol binding site of tubulin. Second, the
tubulin–lankacidin C complex of each of the different binding
modes was studied using all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics
simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were studied to assess
the stability of the complexes. Third, the trajectories were used
to estimate the binding energy between the ligand and the protein
in each binding mode using the MM/PBSA method. Finally, a multiple-trajectory
approach was followed to further assess the stability of each binding
mode. In addition, validating this protocol required that we apply
the same steps to dictyostatin, whose native crystal structure with
tubulin is available, to make sure that the protocol is able to predict
its binding mode correctly. The reason we choose dictyostatin is its
structural similarity to lankacidin C.

4.1 Ensemble-Based
Docking
In ensemble-based
docking, an ensemble of different receptor binding site conformations
is used for docking, in an effort to account for receptor flexibility
in the docking process. The ligand is docked into the binding site
of each of these different conformations, and the different binding
poses are ranked according to some scoring function. In this study
and to obtain an ensemble of different tubulin binding site conformations,
we screened the Protein Data Bank for entries of tubulin bound to
various structurally diverse molecules at the taxol binding site.
The search returned four distinct tubulin–ligand complexes
including tubulin–paclitaxel complex with the PDB ID: 3J6G,16 tubulin–discodermolide complex with the PDB ID: 5LXT,17 tubulin–epothilone A complex with the PDB ID: 1TVK,18 and tubulin–dictyostatin complex with the PDB ID: 5MFA.19 The binding pocket of each of these complexes takes a different
shape to accommodate the ligand; see Figure 2. Each of these complexes was cleaned by
the elimination of the unnecessary α-tubulin subunit and retention
of the β subunit where the binding pocket is located. Molecular
Operating Environment (MOE, 2012)23 was
used for receptor preparation and the addition of missing hydrogen
atoms via protonate3D, which optimizes the tautomeric forms of residues
such as histidine and allows flipping of amide groups of side chains
to optimize protonation.

The ensemble-based docking was done
twice: once utilizing GOLD 5.6.3 (CCDC)24 and another time utilizing FRED from the OEDocking 3.2.0 suite (OpenEye).25,26 In each case, a slightly different protocol was applied to make
sure we try as many different protocols as possible. In GOLD docking,
the processed β subunits of the proteins from the four different
PDB structures were superimposed and were ready for docking. As to
the ligand, the crystal structure of lankacidin C was downloaded from
the Protein Data Bank, PDB ID: 3JQ4.7 MOE was
utilized to perform a stochastic conformational search for lankacidin
C to capture the flexibility of the 17-membered macrocyclic ring.
A database of the low-energy conformations of lankacidin C was then
used for docking against the ensemble of protein conformations superimposed
by GOLD in the previous step. In the docking protocol, the binding
site was defined to be within 6.0 Å of the co-crystallized ligands
in the taxol binding site; pyramidal N and ring corners were allowed
to flip; and CHEMPLP was used as a scoring function, without early
termination to generate diverse solutions. The solutions were then
analyzed visually, and the best-ranked poses were classified into
a set of four distinct modes. The complex of each mode together with
its corresponding tubulin conformation was later taken into a molecular
dynamics simulation for further assessment of the complex stability
and binding energy.

As to the docking step performed by FRED,
the β subunit of
the four different tubulin conformations was processed similarly using
the make_receptor module. Lankacidin C was then subjected to a conformational
search using OMEGA 3.2,27 allowing the
macrocycle to be flexible to explore different ring conformations.
The ensemble of lankacidin C conformations was then docked separately
to each of the four different tubulin receptor conformations. The
different poses were scored using the Chemgauss4 scoring function
to identify the best-scoring poses in each of the four docking runs.
Out of each of these runs, we separated the best-scoring pose of lankacidin
C in the complex with the respective tubulin receptor conformation,
ending up with four potential binding modes. These binding modes were
also taken into molecular dynamics simulations to assess their stability
and estimate the binding energy. Thus, in total, we ended up with
four binding modes from GOLD and another four binding modes from FRED.
Similarly, we applied the same aforementioned docking protocol to
dock dictyostatin, whose experimental structure is available, to the
taxol binding site to assess the ability of the protocol to find the
correct binding mode. We made sure that we randomize the structure
of dictyostatin before docking to eliminate any bias in the docking
process.

4.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
The
docking step generated a set of potential binding modes for lankacidin
C with different conformations of tubulin. A complex of the ligand
and the corresponding tubulin conformation for each of the identified
distinct binding modes was further analyzed by molecular dynamics.
The GROMACS 2016.3 molecular dynamics package was used for this purpose.28 We used the force field AMBER99SB-ILDN for the
protein,29 the GAFF force field for lankacidin
C,30 and the polyphosphate parameters developed
by Meagher et al.31 for parameterizing
the guanosine diphosphate cofactor in β-tubulin. We utilized
ACPYPE script to facilitate ligand parameterization.32 Each complex was then solvated in a dodecahedral water
box extending at least 10.0 Å in every direction, using the TIP3P
water model. The system was then neutralized by the addition of sodium
ions. Extra sodium chloride was added to adjust the salt concentration
to 150 mM. The system was then minimized using the steepest descent
algorithm. This was followed with 100 ps NVT equilibration at 300
K with position restraints on the protein and ligands. Subsequently,
100 ps of NPT equilibration at 1.0 bar was performed under the same
position restraints. In all of the dynamics, a short-range cutoff
of 12.0 Å was used for nonbonded interactions. In the end, the
position restraints were released and a production phase of 50 ns
followed under the same conditions as described before, saving coordinates
every 10 ps. Thus, considering the eight different binding modes,
we have performed a total of 8 × 50 = 400 ns simulations of the
lankacidin–tubulin complex. All of these simulations were performed
on NVIDIA Tesla K80 Graphical Processing Units on Bibliotheca Alexandrina
High-Performance Computing Cluster (BA-HPC), Alexandria, Egypt. The
trajectories were later analyzed by assessing the RMSD of the protein
and ligand. This was done after least-square fitting of the Cα atoms of the protein and with respect to the initial
structure before the simulation. Also, a hydrogen bond analysis between
the ligand and the protein in each complex was performed over the
entire trajectory, utilizing VMD 1.9.4a12,33 using default values of a cutoff distance of 3.0 Å and a cutoff
angle of 20°. Binding energies were analyzed as will be described
in the following section. Similarly, this protocol was also applied
to dictyostatin as a proof of concept.

4.3 MM/PBSA
Binding-Energy Calculations
The molecular dynamics trajectory
of each of the studied complexes
was used to estimate the binding energy between the ligand and the
receptor using the MM/PBSA method. This method divides the binding
energy into three components assessed with three different methods.
The first component is nonbonded interactions between the ligand and
the receptor (van der Waals and electrostatic interactions), which
is assessed using molecular mechanics (MM). The second component is
the electrostatic contribution to the solvation free energy, which
is assessed using the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) method.
The third component is the hydrophobic contribution to the solvation
free energy, which is calculated using a surface area (SA) term. For
this sake, we have discarded the first 5 ns from each trajectory and
used the remaining 45 ns for the MM/PBSA calculation at 250 ps intervals,
for a total of 180 frames. We used the g_mmpbsa script developed by
Kumari et al.34,35 for the MM/PBSA calculations.
We used a solute dielectric constant of 2 and a solvent dielectric
constant of 80 for electrostatics. We used the default values for
surface tension (γ = 0.0226778 kJ/(mol Å2)),
probe radius (1.4 Å), and an offset constant of 3.84982 kJ/mol
for the surface area term. Default values were used for the remaining
parameters of the calculation. The binding energies of all different
binding modes were compared, and the best-scoring mode was obtained.
These calculations were done for both lankacidin C and dictyostatin.

4.4 Multiple-Trajectory Approach
A multiple-trajectory
analysis was performed to further assess the stability of each binding
mode of lankacidin C. All of the eight binding modes were taken into
a molecular dynamics simulation using the same conditions and parameters
described in the previous simulation. This time, for each binding
mode, five independent parallel molecular dynamics simulation runs
were performed, each having a production phase of 10 ns length. Thus,
the initial velocity distributions generated in each of the five runs
should be different and the trajectories should be uncorrelated. Hence,
in total, 10 × 5 × 8 = 400 ns simulations were performed
in this step. After that, the trajectory of each run was analyzed
by considering 100 snapshots from the last 1 ns of the 10 ns trajectory.
The average RMSD value of the ligand heavy atoms was calculated over
these 100 snapshots, after fitting the protein backbone atoms to the
initial protein structure before the simulation. For each of the eight
binding modes, the average RMSD value for each of the five independent
simulations was assessed, and if the value of at least one of these
five runs was less than 2.0 Å, the ligand was judged to be stable
in this binding mode. This approach was outlined by Liu and Kokubo
in previous studies and was shown to be effective in assessing the
stability of different binding modes.21,22 Based on the
results of this analysis, some of the simulation runs were extended
from 10 to 40 ns to further confirm persistent stability or instability.
This resulted in a total of extra 300 ns simulation time. Collectively,
the length of the molecular dynamics simulations applied to lankacidin
C–tubulin complex in the parallel runs outlined in this section
as well as the single runs outlined in Section 4.2 was 400 + 300 + 400 = 1100 ns or 1.1 μs.
