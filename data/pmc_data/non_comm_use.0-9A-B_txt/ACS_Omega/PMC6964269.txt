Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is one of the most destructive bacterial diseases in agriculture.
There is no effective control method, although chemical pesticides
are used to prevent this disease, but they may lead to serious problems
of environmental pollution. Natural products from plants can be rich
and environmentally friendly sources for a broad spectrum biological
control of bacteria. This study focuses on the pericarp of mangosteen
(Garcinia mangostana) using bioactivity-guided
analysis of different fractions and liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry combined with multivariate analysis to determine markers
of active fractions. Six prenyl xanthones, including two new xanthones,
garcimangosxanthones H and I, were isolated and identified by NMR
and HRESIMS. The biomarker γ-mangostin displayed significant
activity against the phytopathogen R. solanacearum with an IC50 of 34.7 ± 1.5 μg/mL; γ-mangostin
affected the bacterial morphology at a concentration of 16.0 μg/mL
as seen with a scanning electron microscope image, and it significantly
repressed the virulence-associated genes HrpB, FihD, and PilT of R. solanacearum. γ-Mangostin also reduced the symptoms of bacterial wilt disease
effectively that is caused by R. solanacearum in tomato and tobacco seedlings in vitro. These results suggested
that the use of γ-mangostin from the mangosteen pericarp against R. solanacearum may be used as a natural bacteriostatic
agent in agriculture.

==== Body
Introduction
Ralstonia solanacearum is an extremely virulent soil-borne phytopathogenic bacterium with
a broad geographical distribution, extensive host range, persistence,
and high viability in soil. This soil-borne bacterium causes bacterial
wilt disease in more than 200 plant species (50 families), including
key crops like tomato, peanut, potato, pepper, tobacco, banana, and
eggplant,1 and this has resulted in serious
economic losses in agriculture. For example, R. solanacearum can destroy potato crops, leading to an estimated $1 billion losses
annually worldwide.2 The management of
bacterial wilt with chemicals, biological agents, and cultural methods
has been used to protect crops for decades.3 Even though various management strategies have been developed to
control this disease, an efficient and environmentally friendly method
is still lacking.4

Phytochemical
biopesticides have great promise because they are often less toxic,
less persistent, more environmentally friendly, and are nontarget
organisms.5 Scientists have focused on
plant-derived natural products that attempt to exploit and develop
new biopesticides to overcome bacterial wilt. For instance, screening
the activity of 52 tropical medicinal plants has shown that 25% (13
species) inhibited the growth of R. solanacearum.6 The isolated natural products included
essential oils and monoterpenes,7,8 lansiumamide B,9 methyl gallate,10 protocatechualdehyde,11 hydroxycomarins,12 and flavonoids13 from different species
that inhibited the survival of the soil-borne pathogen R. solanacearum and revealed potential for controlling
bacterial wilt.

Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) is grown in Southeast Asia; it is a well-known tropical fruit and
termed as the “queen of fruits” for its unique sweet–sour
taste.14 The pericarp has been used in
traditional medicine in Southeast Asia for the treatment of conditions
likely caused by bacteria such as skin infections, diarrhea, abdominal
pain, dysentery, and infected wounds.15,16 Phytochemical
investigations revealed that the pericarp of mangosteen is rich in
isoprenylated xanthones, which have a wide range of reported biological
functions from antioxidant to anti-inflammatory, but for the purposes
of this study, the most germane reports are its antimicrobial activity.17 Mangosteen has been used in various food products
and animal feed supplementation, and mangosteen-based products may
benefit for engineering and biomedical industries.18 However, the use of the fruit pericarp (peel) waste in
crops and agriculture have received limited attention.

As part
of our ongoing research on biological control agents from medicinal
plants in South China, we have screened >150 medicinal plants against R. solanacearum in vitro, and the mangosteen pericarp
was one of the most active. The objective of this study was to identify
natural metabolites from the mangosteen pericarp with antimicrobial
activity against R. solanacearum and
thereby identifying a way to exploit this waste stream as a useful
biological control for bacterial wilt.

Results and Discussion
An ethanol extract of the mangosteen
pericarp was separated over a silica gel column by eluting with petroleum
ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol sequentially
to obtain 10 fractions. Each of the 10 fractions was then analyzed
by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and
antibacterial assays. The results of bioactivity were used to construct
multivariate analysis to help identify underlying biomarkers, which
were further isolated and identified (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Strategy applied to identify antibacterial metabolites
from the mangosteen pericarp.

Antibacterial Activity of Screened Crude Extracts against R. solanacearum
The crude extract of the
mangosteen pericarp showed significant effect on the growth of R. solanacearum using an agar disk dilution method
(Figure S1A). In this study, the antibacterial
metabolites from the pericarp were identified. First, the mangosteen
pericarp was extracted with ethanol and separated over a silica gel
column with petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone,
and methanol sequentially, and this resulted in 10 crude fractions
(A1, A2, B1..., E2). Each of the 10 fractions was tested for antibacterial
activity under
the same conditions. Only the dichloromethane fractions (Fr. B1 and
B2) showed significant antibacterial activity (Figure S1B), and therefore, B1 and B2 were selected for metabolomics
analysis and compound isolation.

LC–MS-Based Multivariate Analysis of Potential Antibacterial
Markers
To investigate the specific antibacterial (R. solanacearum) compounds from fractions B1 and
B2, bioactivity-guided isolation of antibacterial compounds coupled
with LC–MS-based multivariate analysis was used in this study
to determine biomarkers effectively. LC–MS analysis was optimized
for all 10 fractions, as shown in Figure 2A. The chemical constituents of five selected
fractions were different but share a common peak at 5.80 min. Positive
mode was selected because more peaks were detected, and their relative
abundance was higher compared to negative mode. For example, in negative
mode, most of the peaks visible in positive mode from 1.0–4.0
and 7.3–12.0 min were missing (Figure S2). Therefore, the positive raw data was used and included retention
time, exact mass (3858 ions in total), and ion intensity as variables
in the multivariate analysis. Using a nontargeted PCA score plot,
fractions B1–B2 and C1–C2 were clustered into one group,
thus indicating that they share common metabolites (Figure 2B). However, among the 10 fractions,
only dichloromethane fractions (Fr. B1 and B2) displayed significant
antibacterial activity against R. solanacearum.

Figure 2 UPLC-MS combined with multivariate analysis to determine markers
from the most active fractions of the mangosteen pericarp extract.
(A) Total ion chromatograms (TIC) of different fractions isolated

the fractions A1, A2.., E2, as shown in Figure 1. (C) S-plots based on OPLS-DA analysis to
determine molecular ions of markers for the active fractions (inactive
group, −1; active group, 1). R2Y = 0.98 and Q2 = 0.85.
Red dots indicate the priority potential biomarkers in active groups.
(D) Variable importance in the projection (VIP) obtained from the
OPLS-DA model for the most discrimination among active fractions from
inactive fractions. Red bar graphs correspond to the selected markers
in OPLS-DA.

OPLS-DA with the S-plot model was used to separate
trends between active and inactive samples or clarify different samples,
leading to select potential biologically active compounds.19 We compared two groups using OPLS-DA: fractions
B1 and B2 were active, and fractions A1, A2, C1, C2, D1, D2, E1, and
E2 were inactive. The constructed OPLS-DA model performed well based
on the R2Y = 0.98 and Q2 = 0.85 (Figure 2C). The OPLS-DA model was validated by permutation
test 200 times, and Q2 intercepts the y axis below zero (−0.282), indicating that the model
is not overfitting (Figure S3). For the active fractions, the highlighted
points in the red box at the top of the S-plot (Figure 2C) may correlate with biological activity.
Therefore, 17 ions were selected as markers for potential antibacterial
metabolites in fractions B1 and B2 (Table 1). The variable importance for the projection
(VIP) >1 generally identifies a variable’s importance to
the model, which helped to identify significant metabolites that contributed
most to group separation in the OPLS-DA.20 The higher values of VIP suggested which active markers in the active
fraction had priority potential (Figure 2D). Several markers had the same molecular
weights, and it was therefore challenging to separate and isolate
these isomers. Because the exact mass is not possible to measure with
the TQD-MS used in this study, mass ions and retention times provided
important information to identify target markers.

is sorted from high to low and shows confidence intervals for the
VIP values, normally at the 95% level.

Identification of Possible Biomarkers
LC–MS-based
multivariate analysis provided 17 candidate marker ions. These candidate
antibacterial metabolites were isolated by sequential chromatographies
that included a silica gel column, Sephedax LH-20 chromatography,
and semipreparative HPLC to yield six compounds. Their structures
were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), UV, and HRESIMS
spectroscopy as four known compounds α-mangostin (1),21 γ-mangostin (2),21 smeathxanthone A (3),22 and mangostenol (4),23 and compounds 5 and 6 were characterized as new xanthones (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Isolated compounds 1 to 6 from the mangosteen pericarp (1; α-mangostin; 2, γ-mangostin; 3, smeathxanthone A; 4, mangostenol; 5, garcimangosxanthone H; 6, garcimangosxanthone I).

Compound 5, a yellow amorphous powder
with a molecular ion at m/z 413.1608
[M + H]+, corresponds to a molecular formula of C23H24O7, with an index of hydrogen deficiency
of 12. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2) for 5 showed the presence
of four methyl groups [δ 1.42 (6H, s) and 1.20 (6H, s)], one
chelated phenolic hydroxyl group (δ 14.18), two methylene protons
[δ 1.57 (2H, m) and 3.30 (2H, dd, J = 9.7,
6.8 Hz)], one cis-olefinic proton [δ 6.60 (1H,
d, J = 10.0 Hz), 5.72 (1H, d, J =
10.0 Hz)], and two aromatic singlets (δ 7.10 and 7.04). In the 13C NMR spectrum, there were signals for two methylene groups
at δ 21.9 (C-16) and δ 43.6 (C-17), two methyl carbons
at δ 29.1 (C-19 and C-20), and a quaternary carbon connected
to a hydroxyl group at δ 69.3 (C-18); these data suggested that 5 contains a 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl moiety. Other signal
sets included a 2,2-dimethychromene ring at δ 114.8 (C-11),
127.8 (C-12), 77.9 (C-13), and 27.9 (C-14 and C-15). All these moieties
and the NMR chemical shift of 5 are similar to those
of garcimangosxanthone E,24 except for
the absence of a signal for the aromatic methyoxy group. The structure
assignment of 5 was supported further by the HMBC spectrum
(Figure 4). The 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl
moiety was attached to the C-8 carbon based on the HMBC corrections
from H-16 to C-7, C-8, and C-8a. The HMBC correlations between Me-15/C-12,
C-13, and C-14, H-12/C-2, H-11/C-1, C-3, and C-13 deduced the 2,2-dimethylchromene
ring that was attached at C-2 and C-3. Other key HMBC and 1H-1H COSY are shown in Figure 4. Accordingly, the structure of 5 was determined as 1,6,7-trihydroxy-8-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-6′,6′-dimethylpyrano[2′,3′:3,2]
xanthone, a new trioxyengated xanthone named as garcimangosxanthone
H.

Compound 6, a yellow amorphous, colorless
powder with a molecular formula of C23H24O6, is based on HR-ESI-MS (m/z 397.1659, [H + M]+) and 12° of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Table 2) contained one chelated hydroxyl group at
δ 13.21. The aromatic region showed a clear ABX pattern, which
was revealed by resonances at δ 7.28 (1H, dd, J = 7.8, 1.3 Hz), 7.24 (1H, t, J = 7.8 Hz), and δ
7.28 (1H, dd, J = 7.8, 1.3 Hz). A 2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl
group was established based on its characteristic pattern [δ
4.86 and 4.72 (1H, each, s), 4.32 (1H, m), 3.21(1H, dd, J = 14.7, 3.2), 3.03 (1H, dd, J = 14.8, 7.7), and
1.81(3H, s)] and one prenyl group [δ 3.28 (2H, d, J = 7.0, 1.3 Hz), 5.18 (1H, d, J = 7.4 Hz), 1.61
(3H, s), and 1.67 (3H, s)]. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectroscopic
data disclosed the presence of 23 carbon atoms, the characteristic
carbonyl at δ 180.9, two benzene rings, and 2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl
and prenyl groups, which indicated that 6 was a trioxygenated
xanthone derivative.

The characteristic 6, 7, and 8 protons
in the B ring was confirmed further by the 1H-1H COSY (Figure 4).
The HMBC showed that H-8 correlated with C-9 (δ 180.9), which
indicated that C-5 was substituted by a phenolic group. In the HMBC
spectrum, the chelated hydroxyl proton correlated to three aromatic
carbons at δ 110.6 (C-2), δ 158.0 (C-1), and δ 102.2
(C-9a). Furthermore, H-11 correlated with C-1, C-2, and C-3 of the
A ring, which indicated that the prenyl group was attached to the
C-2 carbon (Figure 4). Moreover, the key HMBC correlation (Figure 4) between H-16 and two oxygenated aromatic
carbons at δ 162.4 (C-3) and δ 152.6 (C-4a) confirmed
that the 2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl group was assigned to C-4. Therefore,
compound 6 was identified as 1,3,5-trihydroxy-2-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-4-(2-hydroxy-3-methylbut-3-enyl)
xanthone, a new xanthone isolated from a natural source named as garcimangosxanthone
I.

Antibacterial Analysis of Markers
Six isolated compounds
(1–6) were tested for their antibacterial activity
against R. solanacearum. Only γ-mangostin
(2) showed a significant effect on the growth of R. solanacearum in an agar medium (Figure 5A,B), α-mangostin (1) displayed weak antibacterial activity, and other compounds
were inactive. The VIP value of 2 (14.48) was the highest
in the OPLS-DA model (Table 1), which was the most active compound in the active fractions.

γ-mangostin inhibited the growth of R. solanacearum. (A) Antibacterial studied using the Oxford cup method on the agar
medium at different concentrations of γ-mangostin. (B) Different
concentrations of streptomycin sulfate served as positive control

panels (E) and (F), treated with γ-mangostin at final concentrations
of 16 and 128 μg/mL, respectively. Yellow arrows show the changes
in the cells.

We conducted further research on the effect of
γ-mangostin (2) on the growth of R. solanacearum. The inhibitory
rate of γ-mangostin using a treatment of 8 μg/mL was 37.5%,
and it showed a relatively high effect with an IC50 value
of 34.7 ± 1.5 μg/mL (Figure S4). This indicates that the γ-mangostin in the pericarp can
contribute significantly to the antibacterial activity against R. solanacearum. In a liquid medium, a low concentration
of γ-mangostin did not affect the growth curve of pathogenic
bacteria (Figure 5C),
but when the bacterium was treated with higher concentrations (100
and 200 μg/mL), it delayed the growth in the logarithmic phase.
In addition, morphological changes in R. solanacearum treated with γ-mangostin were observed using a scanning electron
microscope. Some cells were deformed, and the cell surface showed
different degrees of shrinkage under a treatment with 16 μg/mL
γ-mangostin, although the cell surface was still smooth (Figure 5E). In treatments
with high concentrations at 128 μg/mL, cell surfaces were rough,
irregular, exhibited significant shrinkage, and they were accompanied
by many bubble-like protrusions (Figure 5F), which suggested that γ-mangostin
inhibited the growth of R. solanacearum and caused morphological changes.

Biomarker Represses the Virulence Associated Genes of R. solanacearum
Biomarker γ-mangostin
affected the pathogenesis of R. solanacearum, which was supported further by analyses of the expression of five
virulence-associated genes (hrpB, phcA, phcB, fihD, and pilT). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that γ-mangostin significantly
repressed the expression of hrpB, fihD, and pilT with a treatment of 64 μg/mL, but
in contrast, genes PhcA and PhcB showed enhanced expression (Figure 6). The virulence and pathogenicity in R. solanacearum is controlled by a complex regulatory
network, although two determinants that include a phenotype conversion
(Phc) system and a hrp-encoded Type III secretion
system (TTSS) responded to environmental stimuli.25 The regulatory gene hrpB controlled TTSS
in diseases caused by R. solanacearum,26 but its expression was negatively
regulated by phcA.27 Our
data indicated that an increase in phcA and phcB led to the repression of hrpB genes
under the treatment by γ-mangostin. Swimming motility played
a key role in the prophase infection by R. solanacearum. Two important genes (fihD and pilT) that were responsible for motility were repressed
significantly that they affected the swimming motility of R. solanacearum. The process of pathogenicity in R. solanacearum is controlled by a completed regulation
system and involves the expression of multiple genes in response to
the environment. γ-Mangostin affected the virulence-associated
genes of R. solanacearum, but this
requires more experiments for clarification.

Efficacious Control of Ralstonia Wilt Disease
The bioactive compound γ-mangostin was evaluated for antibacterial
activity in vivo caused by R. solanacearum in both tomato and tobacco seedlings. In the tomato pot experiment,
some of the plants in the negative control group (CK) wilted completely
after 14 days of post-inoculation, although treatment with γ-mangostin
and streptomycin sulfate (SM) reduced Ralstonia wilt
disease (Figure 7A).
In particular, no leaves wilted under a high concentration of γ-mangostin
(400 mg/L). The control efficiency of γ-mangostin was evaluated
at 14 and 22 days after inoculation with R. solanacearum (Figure 7B). γ-Mangostin
control efficiency was lower than streptomycin sulfate (SM) at the
same treatment concentration. However, a higher concentration at 400
mg/L reduced bacterial wilt disease effectively, and the control efficiency
was 71.4% at 22 days after treatment. These results suggest that the
effectiveness of γ-mangostin against tomato bacterial wilt related
closely with the concentration that was applied. In addition, the
leaves of tobacco seedlings inoculated with R. solanacearum wilted 8 days after inoculation (Figure 7C). The trends in the disease index for γ-mangostin
and streptomycin sulfate were similar, and the emergence of wilting
symptoms was delayed as the disease index decreased compared with
the untreated control (CK). The disease index of γ-mangostin
was lower than that of streptomycin sulfate before 14 days. These
results suggested that γ-mangostin reduced bacterial wilt in
tomato and tobacco seedlings, and it might control plant bacterial
wilt in plants generally.

mg/L, respectively). (C) Progress of Ralstonia wilt
disease on tobacco plants (SM100, 100 mg/L streptomycin sulfate, γ-man100,

Each experiment included 36 plants.

Conclusions
The pericarps of mangosteen underwent bioactivity-guided
analysis of different fractions. Liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry combined with multivariate analysis was used to effectively
identify antibacterial fractions in the active fractions. Six prenyl
xanthones, including γ-mangostin and two new xanthones, were
isolated and identified. Among the six tested compounds, γ-mangostin
showed the best antibacterial activity against the phytopathogen R. solanacearum in vitro. The effect of γ-mangostin
on selected genes in R. solanacearum was evaluated for the first time. γ-Mangostin controlled bacterial
wilt effectively, and it might have the potential to be developed
as a natural bactericide to control plant bacterial wilt in the future.

column, 9.4 mm × 25 cm, 4 μm). Sephadex LH-20 (25–100
μm) was purchased from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Piscataway,
NJ), and HPLC-MS grade acetonitrile, water, and formic acid were purchased
from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) silica gel plates and a silica gel of 200–300 mesh were
obtained from Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co. Ltd. (P. R. China), and
all reagents were analytical grade (Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory,
P. R. China).

Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions
The R. solanacearum strain was obtained from the Laboratory
of Crop Ecology (South China Agricultural University) from a previous
study.28 The strain was cultured on a nutrient
agar (SMSA) medium (peptone, 10.0 g; casein enzymolysis, 1.0 g; glucose,
10.0 g; agar, 18.0 g; deionized water, 1000 mL; pH 7.0). Single colonies
were transferred to nutrient broth (NB; liquid medium). The flasks
were shaken at 180 r/min at 30 °C for 24 h and then stored at
−80 °C before use.

Extraction and Isolation
Fresh mangosteen (G. mangostana) was purchased from the Guangzhou fruit
market in July 2015 (Guangdong Province, southern China). The dried
pericarp of mangosteen (0.7 kg) was grounded into a powder and extracted
with a 95% ethanol soak for 36 h. The filter solution was concentrated
under reduced pressure at 40 °C to yield the crude extract (280
g). Then, 255 g of extract was chromatographed using silica gel column
chromatography and eluted by petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl
acetate, acetone, and methanol (2000 mL, each), which produced 10
combined fractions (Fr. A1, Fr. A2, Fr. B1, Fr. B2, ..., Fr. E1, and
Fr. E2). Each fraction was then analyzed by LC–MS and antibacterial
assays before preparative-scale isolation. The active fractions Fr.
B1 and B2 were combined and labeled as Fr. B (65 g), and it was chromatographed
using silica gel column chromatography with a gradient system of petroleum-acetone
(100–10 → 0:100) to produce seven fractions (Fr. B1 → Fr. B7). Fr. B5 was isolated
using Sephadax LH-20 (MeOH-dichloromethane, v/v = 1:1) to produce
eight subfractions (Fr. B5–1 → Fr. B5–8). Fr. B5–5 was chromatographed
using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to produce compounds 1 (25.5 mg) and 2 (40.2 mg). Fr. B5–6 was purified subsequently by reversed-phase preparative HPLC and
gradient eluted MeOH/H2O to obtain compounds 4 (12.0 mg) and 6 (10.5 mg). Fr. B5–8 was chromatographed repeatedly over reversed-phase HPLC and eluted
with a step gradient of MeCN/H2O, which yielded compounds 5 (4.5 mg) and 3 (9.0 mg). The spectroscopic
data for new compounds are as follows:

Garcimangosxanthone H
(5): yellow amorphous powder; 1H and 13C NMR (DMSO, 600 MHz) data, see Table 2; UV (MeOH) λ max (log ε): 243
(4.35), 260 (4.23), and 289 (4.22) nm; IR(KBr) υmax 2965, 2933, 1655, and 1621 cm–1; and HRESIMS m/z 413.1608 [M + H]+ (calculated
for C23H25O7, 413.1600).

Garcimangosxanthone

Antibacterial Activity of Fractions/Compounds from the Mangosteen
Pericarp
Antibacterial activity of crude extracts or fractions
against R. solanacearum was detected
by the agar diffusion method with minor modifications.9 Nutrient agar (SMSA) was melted and cooled at room temperature
to 35 °C, and the overnight-cultured, bacterial suspension was
inoculated with SMSA to obtain bacteria-containing media with a concentration
of R. solanacearum of OD600 = 0.1 (≈108 cfu/mL), mixed well, and poured into
9 cm diameter Petri dishes (15 mL each). Oxford cups were placed into
plates, and 150 μL of different concentrations of samples was
pipetted into the cups. All samples were performed three times, and
methanol was used as a negative control. The diameters of inhibition
zones were measured after samples were cultured for 48 h at 30 °C.

Antibacterial assay of compounds were performed in 96-well microtiter
plates by a previously described method.29 Briefly, 50 μL of cultured bacterial suspension (OD600 = 0.2) was added to 50 mL of NB medium containing γ-mangostin
at final concentrations ranging from 3.13 to 100 mg/L. The final volume
is 100 μL in each well. The negative controls were treated with
1% methanol, and the dilutions were prepared with six replicates.
The inoculated plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h after
shaking at 280 rpm for 20 min on a shaker table. The absorbance data
process at 600 nm was measured by a microplate reader (BioTek, Epoch2,
USA). Inhibition percent was calculated using the following equation:
% inhibition = (absorbancecontrol – absorbancesample)/(absorbancecontrol) × 100. The antibacterial
activity was displayed as IC50.

The Growth Curve of R. solanacearum
A solution of γ-mangostin (200 mg/L) was added to
30 mL of NB medium at an aseptic workstation to obtain phytochemical-containing
media with test concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L. A
final concentration of DMSO of 0.5% was used as the solvent control.
Then, 100 μL of bacterial suspension (OD600 = 1.0)
that had been cultured for 24 h was inoculated with the phytochemical-containing
medium, which was cultured at 30 °C with shaking at 180 r/min.
The OD600 values of the samples were measured every 3 h
for 24 h using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The experiment was
repeated three times.

Observations of Cell Morphology with Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
After 24 h, 100 μL of cultured bacterial suspension
(OD600 = 1.0) was added to 30 mL of NB medium containing
γ-mangostin at final concentrations of 16 and 128 mg/L, respectively.
The mixtures were shaken at 180 r/min at 30 °C for 24 h. A mixture
(1.0 mL) with OD600 = 1.6 was centrifuged for 8 min at
5000 r/min, and the supernatant was removed. Then, the mixture was
rinsed with 0.1 M PBS buffer, and it was centrifuged three times to
obtain the sediment. A 500 μL 2.5% glutaraldehyde was added
to the sediment and mixed completely. A small amount of bacteria droplets
was pipetted onto the coverslip, spread gently, and stored in a refrigerator
at 4 °C for 12 h. The bacteria sample was washed with 0.1 M PBS
buffer three times, fixed with 1% osmic acid in a hood for 30 min,
and then washed with 0.1 M PBS buffer again. Next, different concentrations
of ethanol were used to dehydrate the sample gradually (10 min per
concentration). The morphology of the bacteria was observed under
a scanning electron microscope after drying overnight in an oven.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR Assays
Total RNA was extracted
from the collected cells of R. solanacearum using the RNAiso Plus reagent, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Takara Bio Inc., Shanghai, China). RNA degradation and
contamination were checked on 1% agarose gels, and RNA concentration
and purity were monitored using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop One spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., USA). cDNA was synthesized from 0.8
μg of total RNA using the PrimeScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shanghai, China).

All quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses were performed on the ABI 7500 Manager (Life
Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd., Singapore) in a 15 μL reaction
system, which consisted of 5 μL of 3× SYBR Green qPCR mix
(Takara Bio Inc., Shanghai, China), 5 μL of diluted cDNA, 0.3
μL of 50 × Rox, 0.4 mM each primer, and 3.5 μL of
ddH2O. The amplification protocols were as follows: 2 min
at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C
for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. After that, a melting curve from
60 to 95 °C was applied to test the specificity and consistency
of the PCR products. Normalized gene expression was calculated by
the Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.0 software using the Δ Δ Cq
method.

LC–MS-Based Multivariate Analysis
Comparative
analyses of different fractions were performed on an ACQUITY UPLC
system coupled with a triple-quadrupole Xevo TQD mass spectrometer
(Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, UK). An ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18
column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) was employed, and the column
temperature was maintained at 40 °C. Gradient elution with acetonitrile
that contained 0.1% formic acid (A) and water that contained 0.1%
formic acid (B) was performed as follows: 0–0.5 min, 20% B;
0.5–2.5 min, 20–65% B; 2.5–5.0 min, 65–70%
B; 5.0–7.5 min, 70–80% B; 7.5–11.0 min, 80–95%
B; and 11.0–13.0 min, 95% B; the column was reconditioned at
20% B for 2 min to prepare for the next injection. The flow rate was
set at 0.3 mL/min. The auto-sampler was conditioned at 25 °C,
and the injection volume of the solution was 2 μL for analysis.
Mass spectrometric detection was performed on a Xevo TQD equipped
with an electrospray ionization source (ESI). The capillary voltage
was set to 3.5 kV, and the source temperature was maintained at 150 °C.
The collision gas was Ar, N2 gas was used as desolvation
at 400 °C, cone gas was at a flow rate of 750 L/h, and cone gas
was set to 50 L/h. Both positive and negative data were collected
by MS mode using a scan time of 0.5 s.

UPLC-MS full scan data
were processed as described previously.19 Briefly, data preprocessing that included peak peaking, alignment,
peak integration, and correction of retention time for all raw data
was processed using MarkerLynx. The parameters used included a retention
time range of 0.5–11.5 min, a mass range of 100–1000
Da, and a mass tolerance of 50 mDa. The intensity threshold (counts)
for collection parameters was set at 1000, mass window was set at
0.05, retention time tolerance was set at 0.20, noise elimination
level was set at 6.00, and isotopic peaks were excluded for analysis.
The SIMCA 14.0 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) was used for untargeted
principal component analysis (PCA) and for supervised orthogonal partial
least squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) with Pareto scaling
(Par) to normalization. To guard against model overfitting, the OPLS-DA
model was validated with a 200 times permutation test. VIP scores
and S-Plot of the OPLS-DA model were extracted for selected markers.

Pot Experiment
The control of bacterial wilt in tomato
and tobacco seedlings was evaluated after they were inoculated with
the bioactive compounds of R. solanacearum using the pot experiment performed with minor modification.29 Tomato seedlings were grown for 3 weeks in a controlled
chamber and then transferred to vinyl pots with a diameter of 10 cm
(one plant each) until the 5–6 leaf stage of plants. γ-Mangostin
was prepared at final concentrations of 200 and 400 mg/L that contained
1% methanol in water. The phytochemical solution (20 mL) was poured
into each tomato pot. After 3 h, potted plants were inoculated with
20 mL of R. solanacearum suspension
(OD600 = 0.1) by pouring over the wounded root. The second
treatment with γ-mangostin solutions was conducted 5 days after
the first treatment. Plants treated with streptomycin sulfate (200
mg/L) were used as a bactericide control, and 1% methanol in water
served as a negative control (CK). Each treatment consisted of nine
plants. Bacterial wilt incidence (WI) was assessed at 14 and 22 days.
Wilt incidence was calculated as the percentage of plants, which were
completely wilted. Control efficacy was calculated as the following
equation:10 control efficacy (%) = 100
× (WI of control – WI of treatment)/ WI of treatment.

The experiment of controlling tobacco bacterial wilt was conducted
as in a previous study.30 Briefly, 30 mL
of γ-mangostin (100 mg/L, with 1% methanol) was added to pots
that contained one tobacco plant at the 6–7 leaf stage. After
12 h, potted plants were inoculated with 20 mL of a R. solanacearum suspension (OD600 = 0.1)
by pouring over the root (noninjured inoculation). Streptomycin sulfate
(100 mg/L) was used as the bactericide control, and 1% methanol in
water was used as a negative control (CK). Each treatment consisted
of two replicates, and each replicate contained nine plants. All plants
in both experiments were maintained in a greenhouse at a temperature
of 30 ± 2 °C, a relative humidity of 70–80%, and
with a light cycle of 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. The occurrence
of diseased tobacco seedlings was recorded every 2 days. Disease index
was recorded accordingly as previously described29 and modified into a scale of 0–4: 0, no symptoms;
1, one leaf partially wilted; 2, one to two leaves wilted; 3, two
to three leaves wilted; and 4, four or more leaves wilted or dead.
The disease index was calculated as follows: disease index = [Σ(number
of diseased plants × number of disease plants)/(total number
of plants × representative value of the highest grade)] ×
100.

Statistical Analysis
Data were present as means plus
standard deviations. The significance of the treatments was analyzed
by one-way ANOVA (P < 0.05). The IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6.0.
