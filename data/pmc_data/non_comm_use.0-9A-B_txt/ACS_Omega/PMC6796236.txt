Aiming at paint removal
on hydraulic cylinder, the effect of molten salt ultrasonic composite
cleaning was studied. First, the mechanism of molten salt cleaning
and ultrasonic cleaning was reviewed. To further describe the composite
cleaning mechanism, the components and internal structure of paint
were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform
infrared. Results showed that the paint had a significant layered
structure. The total thickness was about 100 μm, and the main
components were organic matters, including ester groups, epoxy groups,
and aromatic compounds. Then, combining with thermal environment,
cleaning medium’s property, and ultrasound, the composite cleaning
mechanism was described in terms of three aspects: thermal effect,
chemical reaction, and ultrasonic effect. Besides, the reason why
this composite cleaning had good effect on paint removal, compared
to paint heated in air, was explained through dynamic analysis, which
was the reduction of reaction activation energy from 114.4 kJ/mol
of paint alone to 74.1 kJ/mol.

1 Introduction
Under the effect of complex service environment and external field
load, the surface of various mechanical products often forms pollution
layers with strong adhesion and large coverage, such as carbon deposition
inside the engine, carbonaceous pollutants inside the gearbox, and
large areas of corrosion on part surface.1 And to make mechanical structures possess anticorrosion and esthetic
effects, surface coatings are usually added during the initial manufacturing
stage, such as paint.2 The surface coating
of paint is widely used in many machines. When retired, some important
parts of these machines are usually remanufactured so that the decommissioned
products can be recycled and utilized to the maximum.3−5 However, the paint coated on the surface prevents the surface defects
from being detected and repaired.6,7 Under the effect
of air environment and external field load, some areas of the paint
surface are broken and can easily generate electrochemical reaction,
accelerating the corrosion of substrate. So, it is very vital to remove
the paint coated on the surface to expose the substrate and the defects.

At present, the methods of paint removal are mainly thermal pyrolysis
technology, laser cleaning, shot-blasting, organic solvent treatment,
and dry ice treatment. The thermal pyrolysis technology generally
uses high-temperature combustion to remove contaminants and can cause
a lot of hot cracks on part surface; moreover, its energy consumption
is very high and can generate many harmful substances that could cause
serious pollution to the environment.8 Besides,
while focusing the laser beam to vaporize the paint during the laser
cleaning process, it could limit the purification efficiency of the
harmful gas due to the small-size cleaning range of the laser beam,
and the shot-blasting treatment generally uses small particles to
shock the part surface to remove the paint, but the noise is very
large during the cleaning process and could generate large amounts
of dust.9,10 Organic solvent treatment utilizes the compatibility
of the solvent with organic matters to peel off the paint from the
part substrate, but the solvent itself and the falling paint fragments
could cause immeasurable damage to the environment.11 Dry ice treatment uses solid carbon dioxide to impart a
certain kinetic energy to shock the paint surface at a high speed
and makes the paint shrunk and embrittled by its instantaneous vaporization,
but this treatment could exacerbate the greenhouse effect. However,
molten salt cleaning has the characteristics of good fluidity and
small surface tension and can react with paint at a high speed and
absorb the harmful gases generated by chemical reaction.12,13 Besides, the introduction of ultrasound can increase the cleaning
effect and accelerate the separation of the paint layer from the substrate.

At present, there has been much research on molten salt cleaning
and ultrasonic cleaning. For molten cleaning, Forsberg, F used 80%
sodium nitrate and 20% potassium nitrate(mass fraction) to carry out
the cleaning experiments and introduced the current into the molten
salt bath to remove the oxide layer on the alkali metal surface rapidly,
where its voltage ranged from 6 to 12 V. The cleaning kinetics were
explained as follows: the effect of the electric field increased the
ion density on the part surface and made the ions arrange in order
so that the reactions could be easily carried out.14,15 Yao used molten salt cleaning to remove the carbon deposition and
explained the cleaning mechanism by combining with the physicochemical
properties of molten salt, which included thermal expansion, surface
tension, and chemical action.16 Nie found
that the optimal cleaning parameters on carbon deposition removal
were temperatures of 330–360 °C, NaOH mass fraction of
30%, and NaNO2 mass fraction of 40% or more through carrying
out the KNO3–NaNO2–NaOH ternary
molten salt cleaning experiment.17 Guo
investigated the viscosity and surface tension of the KNO3–NaNO2 binary formula and found that the salt viscosity
and surface tension decreased with the increase of temperature and
the viscosity ranged from 2.3 to 3.8 cP at 190–250 °C.18 Long changed the cleaning temperature to sodium
nitrate ratio when cleaning the dirt on the turbocharger center frame
surface and established the regression equation and response surface
model to quantitatively describe the cleaning cycle under different
temperatures and sodium nitrate ratios. He also found that there were
no adverse effects on cast iron and carbon steel under the cleaning
parameters of ω(NaNO3)/ω(NaOH) = 1:1 (mass
fraction) and cleaning temperature of 482 °C.19 For ultrasonic cleaning, Yusof N S M introduced physical
and chemical effects in the ultrasonic process and believed that the
acoustic cavitation process generated the acoustic streaming effect,20,21 and due to the action of the primary and secondary Bjerknes forces,
the bubbles moved in the opposite direction of the pressure at a high
speed, resulting in the development of bubble streamers. When the
cavitation bubbles ruptured, high-intensity shock waves were generated
and operated on the specimens’ surface.22 Meanwhile, the effect of acoustic cavitation led to the
production of highly reactive radicals, which could act as a strong
oxidant to oxidize the contaminants.23 Mazue
used the 20 kHz ultrasonic system to clean contaminants in the bottom
of the ship, made the cleaning process characterized, and optimized
the parameters (distance, amplitude, and duration) of the hard matrix
painting to determine the extreme cleaning efficiency.24 Maeno studied ultrasonic cleaning with a diluted
hydrochloric acid solution to remove the thin oxide scale formed from
the hot stamping of a bare 22 MnB5 sheet. Through estimating the weldability
and paint adhesion of surface-treated products, he found that the
ultrasonic cleaning with diluted hydrochloric acid could successfully
remove the thin oxide scale and found that the cleaned surface had
sufficient quality for welding and painting.25 In summary, many scholars had done a lot of research on the mechanism
and applications of molten salt cleaning and ultrasonic cleaning and
developed a complete technological system. However, the cleaning medium
of ultrasonic cleaning was mainly water or solution. There is little
relevant research on the molten salt medium with the introduction
of ultrasound, and the effect of this composite cleaning method has
not been studied.

In this paper, aiming at paint removal on
hydraulic cylinder, the molten salt ultrasonic composite cleaning
technology was studied. First, the mechanism of molten salt cleaning
and the mechanism of ultrasonic cleaning were reviewed. To further
describe the composite cleaning mechanism, the components and internal
structure of paint were analyzed. Results showed that the paint had
a significant layered structure. The total thickness was about 100
μm, and the main components were organic matters, including
ester groups, epoxy groups, and aromatic compounds. Then, combining
with the thermal environment, the cleaning medium, and ultrasound,
the composite cleaning mechanism was described in terms of three aspects:
thermal effect, chemical reaction, and ultrasonic effect. Through
analyzing the relationship between the cleaning cycle, temperature,
and ultrasonic power, it was found that that the effect of temperature
on the cleaning cycle was higher than that of the ultrasonic power.
But when paint was heated in air, which also had the thermal effect
and reactions of pyrolysis and oxidation, the cleaning results were
very poor. The reason was explained through the dynamic analysis,
which was the reduction of reaction activation energy.

2 Mechanism Descriptions
Molten salt has had very broad applications
for nearly a century, such as heat treatment, nuclear reactors, and
so on. Owing to its low viscosity, low surface tension, and high specific
heat capacity, molten salt was also introduced into the cleaning field
to remove the contaminations on the part surface, such as paint and
oxide scale.26 The mechanisms of molten
salt cleaning were explained in terms of four aspects: thermal shock,
wetting, deflocculation, and emulsification.27 When parts were put into a high-temperature cleaning environment,
thermal shock produced and destroyed the adhesion strength of contaminants
on the substrate. The wetting effect could make the salts delivered
into the contaminants as well as the interface between contaminants
and substrate. The deflocculation effect could break down the solid
or semisolid contaminants into small particles. And the emulsification
effect could cause the detachment of oily films from substrates.18 Besides, when contaminants were mainly organic
coatings, oxide scales, and carbonized residue, some chemical reactions
were also present in the cleaning system, as shown below.28,29  

Ultrasonic cleaning is used
widely in all walks of life. It uses the ultrasonic waves generated
by electromagnetic oscillator to operate on the part surface and achieve
the purpose of removal.30 The high-frequency
oscillations generated by the ultrasonic wave made the cleaning medium
generate cavity bubbles of near vacuum. When the sound pressure or
sound intensity reaches a certain value, the bubbles rapidly grow
and suddenly close with shock waves generated instantly. Then, a pressure
of about 1012 Pa was generated,31 which
destroyed the structure and the adsorption of insoluble dirt. The
continuous closing and breaking of cavity bubbles repeatedly stroke
the contaminants’ surface, causing fatigue damage of the dirt
layer. For oily contaminants, the effect of emulsification occurred
by high-frequency oscillation and high pressure, dispersing the oil
into the medium. So, the solid particles adhered to the specimens’
surface by oil stain peeled off.32 When
the intrinsic frequency of cavity bubbles equals the vibration frequency
of ultrasonic wave, the resonance effect can be induced, leading to
the accumulation of large amounts of heat energy around the cavity
bubbles, breaking the contaminants’ chemical bond and eventually
resulting in the separation between contaminants and substrate.33,34

Overall, molten salt cleaning and ultrasonic cleaning had
good removal effects on contaminants. When ultrasound was introduced
into molten salt cleaning, both cleaning effects would be enhanced
and this composite cleaning contained, above all, removal effects
of two methods. To further describe the composite mechanism
on paint removal, a composite cleaning experiment was carried out
in the cleaning environment.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
3.1.1 Formula
By analyzing
the literature on the molten salt cleaning and ultrasonic cleaning,
it can be found that the key process parameters for paint removal
are cleaning temperature and ultrasonic power. According to the previous
research on the optimization of salt formula, melting temperature,
cleaning effect, and viscosity, the salt formula in this system is
m(NaNO3)/m(KNO3)/m(NaOH)/m(NaNO2)
= 35:28:30:7%.16 All of the salts in the
formula are analytically pure and were produced by Sino-pharm Group
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.

3.1.2 Hydraulic Cylinder
The hydraulic cylinder is one of the most representative mechanical
parts with paint coating. The paint on the part surface is thick,
uniform, and easy to be divided into equal areas. The adhesion strength
is very high, preventing from oxidation damage. So, the hydraulic
cylinder is taken as the cleaning objective. The hydraulic cylinder
from the retired XCMG Excavator XE60D and the material is mainly 1145
carbon steel. For the convenience of the follow-up cleaning experiment
and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) analysis, the whole hydraulic cylinder is equally divided into
eight parts on one circumference using the Wire Cut Electrical Discharge
Machining (DK7735, made by Hua Zheng), and the width of the part is
120 mm. The whole hydraulic cylinder and one of the cut specimens
are shown in Figure 1, which are shot by Canon EOS 80 D. The parameters of lens are EF-S
of 18–135 mm and f/3.5–5.6.

Figure 1 Cleaning objective.

3.2 Test Equipment
The test equipment uses a self-made molten salt ultrasonic composite
cleaning machine. The machine is equipped with double cleaning tanks,
including a molten salt ultrasonic composite cleaning tank and an
ultrasonic water-washing tank, as shown in Figure 2. The electronic cabinet controls the ultrasonic
power and cleaning temperature. When temperature reaches the preset
parameters, the electronic control cabinet is intelligently turned
on and off so that the temperature in the tank is controlled within
a preset range. Furthermore, the ultrasonic frequency is fixed at
28 kHz, the number is 24, the power adjustment range is 0–1440
W, and the cleaning temperature range is 0–500 °C with
precision ±1 °C. The ultrasonic oscillators are symmetrically
arranged on the front and back surfaces of the cleaning tank.

3.3 Analysis of the Component
and the Internal Structure of the Paint
3.3.1 SEM–Energy
Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) Combination Analysis
The internal structure of paint was investigated using the scanning
electron microscope modules at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Then,
each layer was scanned by energy-dispersive spectrometer modules to
obtain the elements of each paint layer. Before SEM, all samples were
mixed with the mosaic powder (urea–formaldehyde molding powder,
made by SHSIWI) and then made into a mosaic block, which could be
conductive.

3.3.2 Infrared Spectra Analysis
The paint debris obtained from the specimen’s surface was
ground into powders. Then, the paint powders (ca. 5 mg) were mixed
with 150 mg of KBr and milled thoroughly to reach a particle diameter
of < 2.5 mm. The mixtures were compressed into pellets under approximately
10–12 MPa and analyzed using a VERTEX-70FTIR spectrometer.
Spectra were recorded at a resolution of 2 cm–1 for
400–4000 cm–1

3.4 Analysis
of the Viscosity of Molten Salt
The mixed salt was put in
the testing room. The temperature was raised to 350 °C, and the
viscosity value was measured after holding for 25 min. Then, the temperature
reduction program was performed and the system temperature was lowered
to 340 °C. After temperature holding for about 25 min, the viscosity
value was measured. The above procedures were repeated until the temperature
declined to 190 °C.

3.5 Analysis of the Components
of the Gas
The analysis equipment was a gas chromatography–mass
spectrometer (GC–MS) (7890B-5977A, made by Agilent). And the
test condition was shown as below.

3.5.1 Chromatographic

The column was a PLOT-Q capillary column; the
inlet temperature was 250 °C; the initial temperature was 35
°C; the heating rate was 10 °C/min; the termination temperature
was 200 °C; the retention time was 20 min; the carrier gas was
high-purity helium (99.9995%); and the flow rate was 0.8 mL/min.

3.5.2 Mass Spectrometry Conditions
Ionization
mode was ion source; ionization energy was 70 eV; the ion source temperature
was 230 °C; the quadrupole temperature was 150 °C; the transmission
line temperature was 290 °C; the multiplication tube voltage

The thermogravimetric analysis equipment
was Swiss METTLER TOLEDO TGA1 thermogravimetric analyzer. The carrier
gas was air. The temperature range was 25–800 °C, and
the heating rate was 10 °C/min. The paint was ground to a powder.
All specimens’ composition and mass, which were analyzed by
a thermogravimetric experiment, are shown in Table 1.

3.7 Cleaning Procedures
The composite
cleaning test adopted the central composite test method. The independent
variables are cleaning temperature and ultrasonic power. The dependent
variable is the cleaning cycle. According to test equipment parameters
and the literature, it was determined that the cleaning temperature
T range was 270–340 °C and the ultrasonic power P range was 1000–1440 W, and the test factors and
levels are shown in Table 2. The cleaning procedure is summarized in Figure 3.(1) This experiment used the central composite
design to carry out this research. According to the 13 sets of test
parameters set by Minitab, the hydraulic cylinder was divided into
13 parts and the specimens were numbered separately.

(2) First, the salt was placed in the
composite cleaning tank, which was configured according to the formula,
and it was fully melted. Meanwhile, the cleaning parameters were set
according to the requirements. After putting the specimens into the
cleaning tank, the time was recorded rapidly. The experimental phenomenon
could be observed that bubbles occurred during the cleaning process
and the fragments fell off from the specimens. When the reaction phenomenon
stopped, the cleaning was over. Then, the final time was recorded
immediately.

4 Analysis and Results
4.1 Physicochemical Properties of Paint
4.1.1 Micromorphology
Analysis
The paint surface and profile morphology are shown
in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The surface morphology showed that
the paint surface was flat at 500 times, with even dark stripes and
dense white spots. At 10 000 times, it can be further seen
that the white spots were densely arranged on the surface and varied
in size and there were no obvious pits and cracks. On further observation
at 20 000 times, results showed that the white particles ranged
from 200 to 600 nm and were irregular. According to the SEM imaging
principle, the shiny white particles were doped metal particles in
the paint.

Figure 4 Paint surface morphology.

Figure 5 Microstructure
of paint profile.

The profile morphology
showed a distinct layered structure in the paint at 500 times magnification.
The total thickness of the paint layer was about 100 μm, as
shown in Figure 5a.
When further enlarged to 1000 times, as shown in Figure 5b, it showed obvious structural
differences. The topcoat was compact and flat. The primers were mostly
long strips of particles that were significantly larger than the particles
in the topcoat and tightly adhered to the substrate.

4.1.2 Elements Analysis
To analyze the components of each
layer, EDS was used. The elements and mass fraction of the topcoat
and the primer are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Results
showed that there were many kinds of elements in the paint, but the
content was not uniform. Both in the topcoat and primer, the proportion
of C and O elements was the highest, over 70%, which indicated that
the main component of paint was organic matter. In addition to C and
O elements, the paint also contained metal elements such as Al, Ti,
Cr, Fe, etc. This was mainly due to additives such as anticorrosive
ones. The Si may be due to the doping of dust particles in the paint.
Pb is the harmful heavy-metal element derived from the colorant in
the paint, which was the third highest element in paint.

atomic fraction (%)	64.77	30.19	0.30	0.29	1.37	1.57	0.21	1.31	
4.1.3 FTIR Analysis
From the elements analysis, it could be seen that the main components
of the paint were organic matters. To further study the internal groups
of the paint, the primer and topcoat were measured by FTIR spectroscopy,
and the results are shown in Figure 6. According to the FTIR spectrum of the topcoat in Figure 6a, the peaks at 1725
and 1687 cm–1 indicated that the topcoat contained
an ester group (−COO−), which could use the alkaline
cleaning environment to promote the breakage of the ester group and
then be decomposed. The 1074, 763, and 700 cm–1 peaks
indicated that the topcoat contained aromatic compounds.

Figure 6 Infrared spectrum
of paint.

Figure 6b of the primer spectrum showed that the
absorption peak appeared near the primers at 912 and 828 cm–1, indicating that the primer contained the epoxy group. The absorption
peaks at 1447 and 1508 cm–1 indicated that the primer
may contain benzene rings, while the peaks at 1040 and 1017 cm–1 were characteristic peaks of aromatic ethers and
esters, thus demonstrating that the primer contained a benzene ring
structure.

According to the above analysis, the main components
of the paint were organic matter, containing ester groups, epoxy groups,
and aromatic compounds, which showed a distinct layered structure
in the paint. The topcoat structure was firm and flat. The primer
particles were large and strongly adhered to the substrate surface.
Due to the presence of harmful heavy-metal elements in paint, attention
should be paid to the treatment of these elements.

4.2 Mechanism of the Composite Cleaning for Paint Removal
To describe the mechanism of this composite cleaning, the viscosity
of molten salt and the gaseous production were analyzed. Combined
with the components of paint and the mechanism of molten salt cleaning
and ultrasonic cleaning, the removal mechanism was focused on the
effects of thermal environment, chemical reaction, and ultrasound.

4.2.1 Thermal Effect
In the cleaning system, all of the contaminants
and substrate were dipped into the cleaning medium and were all under
the effect of high temperature. However, the thermal expansion coefficients
of the metal substrate and paint were different. At 20–400
°C, the expansion coefficient of steel was (12.9–13.9)
× 10–6. Because of the organic components,
the paint expansion coefficient was much larger than that of steel.
The difference between the two matters’ expansion coefficient
makes a certain degree of extension on the steel substrate,35 resulting in some cracks in the interior of
contaminations. Meanwhile, due to the mainly organic components of
the paint, it can be softened under the thermal effect, and a certain
amount of gullies are generated on the paint surface so that the iron
can easily adhere to the ion-containment reaction interface and participate
in the reaction. The change of paint on the substrate surface is shown
in Figure 7. Furthermore,
the thermal effect can provide the activation energy required for
the hydrolysis reaction of OH– with ester groups
and the oxidation reaction.36,37

Figure 7 Change of the paint under
the thermal environment.

On the other hand, the
thermal effect on the cleaning system can effectively make the cleaning
medium obtain a very low viscosity. Figure 8 shows that within the range of 350 °C,
the viscosity would decline with the increase of temperature. When
the system temperature ranged from 200 to 350 °C, the viscosity
of molten salt kept within 3 cP, indicating that the cleaning medium
kept high fluidity. High fluidity could make it easier to remove the
contaminants from the surface and prevent the contaminants’
fragment from attaching to the substrate again. Moreover, high fluidity
could also enhance the ion migration rate, replenishing the loss of
ions on the reaction interface and making the ions uniform in the
cleaning system. Because of the salt’s physical properties
of small surface tension in the thermal environment, it could allow
the medium to obtain low surface tension in this composite cleaning
system. With low surface tension, it was easy to combine the cleaning
medium with the paint surface and infiltrate interior to the paint,
making the chemical reaction easy on the medium-containments interface.
Under the effect of low surface tension and viscosity, the ion-exchange
rate on the reaction interface would be accelerated so that the NO–2, O–2, and OH– can react with the ester group, epoxy groups, and the aromatic compounds
at a high speed. The cleaning medium could also permeate into the
interior of the paint through the cracks and react with the internal
contaminants, leading to escape of gaseous production from the internal
paint and producing expansion forces to intensify the thermal expansion.

Figure 8 Relationship
between viscosity and temperature.

4.2.2 Chemical Reaction
When conducting the
cleaning experiment for paint removal, there were many bubbles around
the paint that escaped from the cleaning system. Some fragments of
paint were peeled off and gradually discomposed. So, there must be
some chemical reactions existing in the cleaning system. Due to the
thermal environment, the cleaning medium was full of ions, such as
NO3–,
OH–, CO32–, and so on. The presence of NO3– and CO32– enhanced
the solubility of oxygen, which existed in the form of O22– and O2– in the
cleaning system.38 These ions could chemically
react with the organic components. Moreover, the thermal environment
provided the activation energy of the chemical reaction. The removal
model of chemical effect is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Removal model of the chemical effect.

To investigate the reactive versions, the gaseous
production was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.
The approximate composition and content of gaseous production were
obtained as shown in Table 5. Results showed that including CH4, the total
amount of complex organic gases and CO was only 4.81%, indicating
that it would pay a little cost to eliminate the negative influence
on the environment caused by this composite cleaning technology (Figure 10).

As for
the complex gas, its components and contents were obtained through
comparing the GC–MS analysis results with the standard library
NIST 14, as shown in Table 6. Results showed that there were 18 kinds of compounds in
complex gas, including seven kinds of hydrocarbons, five kinds of
aldehydes, three kinds of esters, two kinds of ketones, and one kind
of alcohol.

Hydrocarbon, hydroxyl, and ester were mainly derived
from the pyrolysis of paint. The aldehydes and ketones were mainly
derived from incomplete oxidation of the hydroxyl. And a large amount
of carbonate salts, detected in the waste salt after cleaning, indicated
that a large amount of CO2 was generated during the cleaning
process and proved that some of the containments in the cleaning system
were completely oxidized. The reason was that due to the presence
of NO3– and CO32–, O2 was more easily soluble and existed in the form of
O22– and
O2–.39 And the large amount of nitrate ions could be
used as a reaction catalyst to continuously provide superoxide ions
to oxidize the containments.40 So, the
organic components in the paint, such as the ester groups, epoxy groups,
and the aromatic compounds, could undergo a violent oxidation reaction
under the effect of O–2. With the synergistic effect
of pyrolysis and oxidation, the paint was further decomposed, making
the interior of the paint loosened and reducing the paint adhesion
strength. So, the reactions of pyrolysis and oxidation were involved
in paint removal. The reaction equations are shown below  

In addition,
these complex gases were just 4.73% of the total gas. It could be
easily treated by exhaust gas treatment appliance. Results of Tables 6 and 7 showed that the gaseous components did not contain any metal
elements. They still remained in the molten salt system. After cleaning,
the cleaning medium gradually solidified into blocks with the decrease
of temperature. So, these heavy-metal elements could be fixed in the
salt blocks and be easily treated in the post-treatment process.

4.2.3 Ultrasonic Effect
The ultrasonic oscillators located on both sides of the cleaning
tank can continuously generate ultrasonic waves and high-frequency
oscillations during its operation. On the one hand, the fluidity of
the medium can be enhanced, resulting in the uniform distribution
of the internal temperature field and ions concentration. Owing to
the uniform ion concentration and the enhancing fluidity, the ion-exchange
rate at the medium-containments reaction interface is accelerated41 so that the ions at the reaction interface can
be quickly replenished and then the reaction can be maintained at
a high speed. Meanwhile, the oscillation effect can also make the
contaminant fragments move around, preventing them from falling onto
the paint surface to reduce the reaction rate. It could be obviously
seen that there were some ripples on the interface of the cleaning
system and the fragments of paint were moved around, which indicated
the enhanced fluidity of the cleaning medium.

On the other hand,
the high-frequency oscillations make the cleaning medium generate
cavity bubbles of near vacuum. When the sound pressure or sound intensity
reaches a certain value, the bubbles grow rapidly and then suddenly
close. Therefore, the shock wave is generated at the moment, acting
on the paint surface and causing more cracks. The adhesion of the
paint is destroyed. Moreover, the continuous closing and breaking
of the cavity bubbles repeatedly shocked the paint surface, causing
fatigue damage of the paint and further extension cracks.42

Combined with components of the paint
and the mechanism of molten salt cleaning and ultrasonic cleaning,
the composite cleaning mechanism could be divided into three aspects:
ultrasonic effect, thermal effect, and chemical reaction. The high-temperature
environment in the system caused the paint to undergo a certain degree
of thermal pyrolysis and provided the activation energy that was required
for the oxidation reactions. Besides, with the introduction of ultrasound,
it could enhance the fluidity of the cleaning medium. Owing to the
high-frequency oscillation, the ion concentration and temperature
were uniform in the system and the high-frequency oscillations led
to the generation of ultrasonic cavitation effects that shocked the
paint and therefore destroyed its adsorption.

4.3 Dynamics Analysis
When carrying out composite cleaning,
the cleaning cycle t was recorded under each cleaning
parameter of temperature and ultrasonic power. Results are shown in Table 7.

Table 7 shows that with the increase
of temperature and power, the cleaning cycle was gradually shortened.
Temperature was the precondition of the thermal effect and provided
the activation energy required by chemical reactions. Ultrasonic power
directly affected the ultrasonic removal effect. To further illustrate
the relationship between cycle, temperature, and power, Minitab 17.0
was used to generate the respond surface figure, as shown in Figure 11. Results showed
that when power was fixed, the cycle would change significantly along
with the increase of temperature. But when temperature was fixed,
there was a small change of cycle with the increase of power. So,
the effect of temperature on the cleaning cycle was larger than that
of ultrasonic power. Through the response variable optimizer in Minitab,
the optimal temperature was obtained as 335 °C and power was
1440 W (the maximum of the equipment). The optimal cycle was 4.5061
min.

Figure 11 Change of cleaning cycle with temperature and ultrasonic power.

In the composite cleaning system at 335 °C
and 1440 W, the paint had been cleaned completely in 5 min, as shown
in Figure 12b. Because
the effect of ultrasonic power on the cleaning cycle was a little
small, it would have little influence on the cleaning cycle only under
the effect of pyrolysis and oxidation reactions. However, when the
paint specimen was heated in air at 335 °C and 5 min, there was
still large scale of paint on the part surface, as shown in Figure 12c. Some areas were
gradually blackened and more holes appeared on the paint surface,
indicating the occurrence of pyrolysis and oxidation reactions. Figure 13 shows that the
total mass loss rate of paint in air was about 53%. The Tg curve of the mixture showed that after 470 °C,
the variation trend was consistent with the Tg curve of salts, indicating that the paint was completely
removed at 470 °C.

Figure 12 Comparison of paint surface before and after
heating at 300 °C and 5 min of cleaning time.

Figure 13 TG curve of paint, salt, and their mixture.

To investigate the reasons for the above differences, the Coats–Redfern
integral method was used. In an infinitesimal time interval, the nonisothermal
process can be regarded as an isothermal process. The decomposition
rate equation of the paint could be expressed as 1  where dα/dt is the conversion rate, α is the transmission rate,
α = (m0 – m)/(m0 – mf), m0 is the initial mass, m is the mass at the time of t, mf is the final mass, k(T) is the reaction rate constant, f(α)
is the decomposition process reaction function, t is the time, and T is the thermodynamic temperature.

k(T) could be expressed by the
Arrhenius equation 2  where A is the preexponential factor (min–1), E is the activation energy (kJ/mol), and R is the gas molar constant, whose value is 8.314 × 10–3 kJ/(mol K). Since the experiment used the constant velocity heating
method, the heating rate was β = dT/dt, so formula (1) could be converted into 3  

By integrating formula (3) and assuming that
the decomposition of the paint belonged to the first-order reaction,
the decomposition process reaction function f(α)
could be expressed as f(a) = (1
– a)n, where n = 1, so formula (4) could be obtained 4  

In this test, the
range of T was 298–873 K, E was about 100 kJ/mol, R = 8.314 × 10–3 kJ/(mol K), then 0 < 2RT/E ≪
1, so the ln[(AR/(βE))(1 –
2RT/E)] in formula
(4) was approximately constant. Through
the test, the paint conversion rate at each temperature α was
obtained. Then, 1/T was plotted against ln[−ln(1 –
α)/T2] and the curves were linearly
fitted. Therefore, the linear fit curves of 1 and 3 are shown in Figure 14. It can be seen
that the curves were a straight line with high linear correlation.
By fitting the slope and intercept of the curves, the activation energy E and the preexponential factor A could
be calculated, respectively.

Figure 14 Linear fitting lines of paint and mixture.

It can be inferred from Figure 14 that linear correlation coefficients (R2) were 0.9976 and 0.9496, indicating that the
test met the first-order reaction kinetics. The activation energy
of paint alone was 114.4 kJ/mol. But the activation energy of paint
in salt was just 74.1 kJ/mol, which was much lower than that of the
paint alone. Therefore, salt could effectively reduce the activation
energy required for the decomposition of paint and significantly improve
the paint removal efficiency.

The reduction of activation energy
was due to the fact that the NaNO3–KNO3–NaOH–NaNO2 system could play a bridge role
in the reaction process and provide a good dissolution environment
for oxygen. The oxygen existed in the form of peroxide ions (O22–) and superoxide
ions (O2–) in the cleaning system. Peroxide ions and superoxide ions were
more oxidizing than the oxygen, which was the reason why paint more
easily decomposed in the salt system. Nitrate ions could further promote
the conversion of peroxide ions into superoxide ions, enhancing the
ability of paint removal. So, the adhesion strength of paint would
decrease. By their high fluidity, the paint fragments could easily
peel off from the substrate and would be prevented from attaching
to the substrate again.

5 Conclusions
In summary,
molten salt ultrasonic composite cleaning had a good effect on paint
removal. First, the mechanism of molten salt cleaning and the mechanism
of ultrasonic cleaning were reviewed. To further describe the composite
cleaning mechanism, the components and internal structure of paint
were analyzed. Results showed that the paint had a significant layered
structure. The total thickness was about 100 μm, and the main
components were organic matter, including ester groups, epoxy groups,
and aromatic compounds. Then, combining with the thermal environment,
the cleaning medium, and ultrasound, the composite cleaning mechanism
was described in terms of three aspects: thermal effect, chemical
reaction, and ultrasonic effect.(1) Thermal effect. In a high-temperature environment,
the difference of two materials’ expansion coefficient led
to different thermal expansions, making the paint surface have apophysis
and cracks. With low surface tension, the cleaning medium could easily
combine with the paint surface and infiltrate into these cracks. Besides,
about 3 cP of low viscosity made the medium keep high fluidity, preventing
the paint fragments from attaching to the substrate again and enhancing
the ion migration rate.

(2) Chemical reaction. Through analyzing the gaseous production, we could
find that there were 18 kinds of compounds in complex gas, including
seven kinds of hydrocarbons, five kinds of aldehydes, three kinds
of esters, two kinds of ketones, and one kind of alcohol. Combining
with the ions and the thermal environment, the chemical effect was
mainly the effect of pyrolysis and oxidation reactions.

(3) Ultrasonic effect. The high-frequency
oscillation enhanced the fluidity of medium, resulting in the uniform
distribution of the internal temperature field and the ion concentration.
Besides, the ultrasonic cavitation effect caused more cracks on the
paint surface. Under the effect of shock generated by cavity bubbles,
the paint surface suffered from fatigue damage. So, the paint fragments
were easily separated from the substrate.



The cleaning experiment showed that the effect of temperature on
the cleaning cycle was higher than that of ultrasonic power. But when
paint was heated in air, which also had the thermal effect and the
reactions of pyrolysis and oxidation, the cleaning results were very
poor. The reason was that salt could reduce the reaction’s
activation energy from 114.4 kJ/mol of paint alone to 74.1 kJ/mol.
Because of the limited dimensions of the cleaning tank, the dimensions
of the cleaning objective must be suitable for the tank. So, it is
very vital to select an appropriate cleaning tank for mechanical parts.
