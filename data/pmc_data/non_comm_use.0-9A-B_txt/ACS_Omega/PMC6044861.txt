The development of
high-performing nanocomposites of homogeneously
dispersed graphene oxide in a waterborne polyester matrix with controlled
interfacial interactions is a daunting challenge owing to the presence
of strong cohesive energy in both. Thus, in this study, graphene oxide
was functionalized with toluene diisocyanate and butane diol through
a simple method and incorporated into the waterborne polyester matrix
through a facile in situ bulk polymerization technique without using
any compatibilizing agent or organic solvent for the first time. The
thermoset of the nanocomposite was formed by curing it with hyperbranched
epoxy of glycerol and poly(amido amine). The resultant thermosetting
nanocomposites with 0.1–1 wt % functionalized graphene oxide
exhibited significant enhancement in mechanical properties such as
elongation at break (245–360%), tensile strength (7.8–39.4
MPa), scratch hardness (4 to >10 kg), toughness (17.18–86.35
MJ/m3), Young’s modulus (243–358 MPa), impact
resistance (8.3 to >9.3 kJ/m), and thermostability. Further, the
Halpin–Tsai
model was used to predict the alignment of graphene oxide. The nanocomposite
was also biodegradable against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial strain. Furthermore, this nanocomposite exhibited strong
catalytic activity for the aza-Michael addition reaction. Thus, the
nanocomposite can be utilized as a high-performing sustainable material
in different potential applications including as heterogeneous catalysts.

1 Introduction
Nanotechnology
is a multidisciplinary field which involves design,
engineering, and fabrication of devices at the nanoscale with significantly
alternative and enhanced material properties.1 In this context, polymer nanocomposites have attracted considerable
attention over the last two and a half decades.2 The combined effect of nanoreinforcing materials and the
polymer matrix leads to the development of high-performing polymeric
materials for various industrial applications through the enhancement
of properties such as mechanical, thermal, optical, electronic, magnetic,
and so forth.3 The incorporation of different
nanoreinforcing agents such as clay, carbon nanotubes, metal oxide
nanoparticles, graphene and its derivatives, and so forth, into a
polymer matrix significantly improved the material properties.4−7 Graphene is gaining greater attention among them owing to its excellent
mechanical properties, high aspect ratio, outstanding electrical and
thermal conductivity, high surface area, and so forth. Further, its
unique structure opens up a new avenue to fabricate more efficient
devices for various applications.8,9 However, graphene
oxide (GO) contains a variety of reactive oxygeneous functional groups
like hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxylic acid compared to graphene and
thereby facilitates the fabrication process. It readily forms aqueous
dispersion, it is dispersible in various organic solvents and even
in polymers, and its functional groups may interact with the polyester
matrix.9 However, as the number of such
polar functional groups in GO which interact among themselves so strongly
is very large, the interaction with the polymer matrix is a genuine
question. Therefore, to improve such interactions, some of the polar
functional groups of GO may be functionalized with appropriate reactants
to facilitate better interactions with the polyester matrix, which
results in uniform dispersion in the polymer matrix.10,11 This functionalized GO (f-GO) is thought to be an ideal nanoreinforcing
agent for waterborne polymers because the oxygeneous groups of GO
such as hydroxyl and epoxide spreading across the basal planes and
carbonyl groups existing at edge sites facilitate the dispersion and
interactions with the matrix, thereby helping in exfoliation of GO.
In addition, fabrication and employment of such waterborne polymers
are gaining significant interest because of their advantages such
as no volatile organic compounds, low cost, nontoxicity, environmental
friendliness, ease of clean up with water, and so forth.12 Among different types of waterborne polymers,
polyesters are found to be more interesting, as they also possess
similar functional groups such as carboxylic, hydroxyl, and so forth,
which can interact with the similar functional groups of GO to form
strong interfacial interactions. In addition, the functional groups
of GO can also participate in the curing reaction of the polyester,
especially in the presence of the epoxy and poly(amido amine) hardener
system to form covalent and noncovalent linkages.13 Further, the fabrication of nanocomposites of waterborne
hyperbranched polyester (WHP) with GO can also address the shortcomings
of the pristine polyester system from low mechanical, thermal properties,
and so forth, thereby facilitating their applications in various advanced
fields. Further, apart from enhancement in these properties, incorporation
of GO also retained biodegradability of the material. The design of
such polyester from renewable feed-stocks has achieved remarkable
importance, as it provides assurance of sustainability for the development
of economically attractive technologies.14 To date, a relatively restricted number of studies was reported
on polyester/GO nanocomposites, and no report was available in the
literature on the incorporation of GO in the biobased WHP system,
so far. In the literature, Bastiurea et al. studied mechanical and
thermal properties of polyester nanocomposites with GO and graphene,
but the reported properties were not up to the mark.15 Further, Bora et al. reported the fabrication of unsaturated
polyester and GO nanocomposites and studied mechanical and thermal
properties of this nanocomposite; however, elongation at break was
found to be very low.16 He et al. reported
the thermal properties and fracture toughness of an unsaturated polyester/GO
nanocomposite.17 However, mechanical properties
of all the reported polyester/GO nanocomposites are found to be poor
for their advanced applications. Further, all of the reported literature
used large amounts of organic solvents for the fabrication of nanocomposites
which are not attractive for industrial production. Furthermore, on
the basis of the literature report on the aza-Michael addition reaction
using GO,18 herein, we report the fabrication
of the novel waterborne polyester-supported f-GO catalyst and its
application for aza-Michael reaction in water as a greener solvent
to achieve a complete environment-friendly process. The utilization
of environmentally benign solvents and materials signifies an ideal
green chemical technology process from both economic and environmental
viewpoint.

Therefore, in the present work, WHP nanocomposites
were fabricated
with different loadings of f-GO through an organic solvent and a compatibilizing
agent-free in situ polymerization technique to obtain high-performing
eco-friendly material. The properties of the thermosetting nanocomposite
such as mechanical, thermal, biodegradation, and so forth, were also
studied. The catalytic activity of the nanocomposite for the aza-Michael
addition reaction was also evaluated along with its recyclability
to judge the efficiency as a heterogeneous catalyst.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Functionalization of GO
In the fabrication
of the WHP/f-GO nanocomposite, key issues are dispersion of the nanomaterials
and interfacial interactions of GO with the polyester matrix. The
surface functionalization of GO enormously influences its state of
dispersion in the polymer matrix. The oxygen-containing functional
groups including carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, and epoxy groups can be
used to change the surface functionality of GO.8,19 Thus,
the functionalization of GO was achieved by the reaction of oxygenated
functional groups of GO with isocyanate groups of toluene diisocyanate
(TDI), followed by reaction with 1,4-butanediol (BD) and the resulted
isocyanate-terminated GO. As isocyanate is highly reactive, covalent
functionalization occurred by direct linkage of OH groups of GO with
the isocyanate groups. A schematic preparation of f-GO is shown in Scheme 1. Stable dispersion
of GO and f-GO was observed in different solvents such as tetrahydrofuran
(THF), dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide (DMAc), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and so forth (Scheme 1).

(Photos of GO and f-GO in Different Solvents)
2.2 Characterization
GO and f-GO were
analyzed by different spectroscopic and diffraction techniques (Figure 1a–d). Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) is used to establish the presence of various
oxygen-containing functional groups in them. In the FTIR spectrum
of GO (Figure 1c),
the occurrence of intense bands at 1720 cm–1 (−C=O
stretching), 1202 cm–1 (−C–O–C
stretching), and 1047 cm–1 (−C–O stretching)
and a broad band at 3402 cm–1 (−O–H
stretching) indicates the occurrence of oxygeneous groups such as
carbonyl, carboxylic, epoxy, and hydroxyl in it. The bands that appeared
in the range of 3000–2700 cm–1 are owing
to the stretching vibrations of −CH2 (symmetric
and asymmetric).8−10 The FTIR spectrum (Figure 1c) of f-GO showed the presence of absorption
frequencies at 1541, 1642, 1052, 1700, and 1217, cm–1, which are ascribed to the stretching vibration of bending of N–H
of amide II, C=C, C–N, carbonyl of amide I, and C–O.8 Thus, this FTIR analysis confirmed the covalent
bond formation with GO by TDI and BD. Further, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns (Figure 1a)
of pristine GO showed two peaks at 10.1° and 43.2° for (002)
and (001) graphitic planes, respectively. The peak at 10.1° is
due to the presence of abundant oxygeneous groups which is similar
to the reported literature.8,9 The positions of XRD
peaks are slightly shifted after functionalization of GO which support
the modification of GO. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy is also an
important technique to characterize the carbonaceous materials with
ordered or disordered structures. Raman spectra of both GO and f-GO
showed two fundamental vibration bands in the range of 1200–1700
cm–1 (Figure 1b).20 The vibration mode at 1580
cm–1 (G) is due to the scattering (first-order)
of E2g phonon vibration of sp2 carbon atoms,
and the D vibration band (1351 cm–1) is due to the
A1g breathing mode of carbon associated with structural
defects and disorders.20 In the UV–visible
spectrum (Figure 1d),
GO showed a peak at 233 nm owing to π–π* transitions,
and a weak shoulder at 302 nm is due to n−π* transitions
of aromatic carbon–carbon bonds and C=O bonds.20 Further, transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analysis provides direct visualization of the morphology of GO and
f-GO (Figure 2a–d).
The exfoliated, transparent, and wrinkled GO nanosheets and f-GO were
observed from its TEM images with micrometer lateral dimension. The
occurrence of topological features, besides the overlapping area of
GO nanosheets, revealed that they are extremely dispersed in water.
According to the reported literature, the crumpled topology of GO
is due to the presence of oxygeneous functional groups as well as
the extremely thin characteristic of the nanosheets.18,21 The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of f-GO further confirmed
the retaining of the layer structure of GO even after functionalization
(Figure 2e). The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of f-GO is shown in Figure 2f.

magnifications for morphological observation, (e) HRTEM images at
2 nm for layer observation, and (f) SAED pattern of f-GO.

2.3 Fabrication of WHP and
f-GO Nanocomposites
As both the components polyester and
GO are compatible because
of the presence of an adequate number of polar functional groups,
there are strong interactions among the components, which are shown
in Scheme 2. This interaction
also helps to stabilize the dispersed f-GO, and the stable dispersion
was achieved by mechanical shearing force, followed by ultrasonication
even in aqueous medium (Scheme 2). Ultrasonication generates a localized intensity with high
pressure, temperature, and energy, which helps in the dispersion at
the nanoscale level. To fabricate WHP/f-GO nanocomposites, an in situ
polymerization technique was employed under bulk conditions without
using any solvent or compatibilizing agent. The −OH groups
of f-GO interact covalently and noncovalently with the polyester matrix
during the fabrication process. The nanocomposite was well-dispersed
in water, ethanol, DMAc, DMSO, THF, and so forth.

Scheme 2 Fabrication Route
of the WHP/F-GO Nanocomposite
The resultant nanocomposite was characterized by various
spectroscopic
techniques such as FTIR, XRD, and TEM. The characteristic absorbance
bands for pristine polyester were found at 3451 cm–1 (−O–H stretching), 2953–2805 cm–1 (−C–H symmetric and asymmetric stretching), and 1739
cm–1 (−C=O stretching). The characteristic
carbonyl peak for ester was slightly shifted after the formation of
the nanocomposite, as observed from the FTIR spectrum of PFGN1. Further,
the band at 3000–3500 cm–1 corresponding
to the hydroxyl group of GO shifted to a lower wavenumber. The shifting
of the bands as well as the decreased in intensities of carbonyl group
usually considered as the evidence of hydrogen bond formation between
the polyester matrix and f-GO.22 Therefore,
the shifting of peak positions in the FTIR spectrum of the nanocomposite
(Figure 3a) indicates
the existence of strong interactions such as polar–polar, hydrogen
bonding, and so forth, between the polyester matrix and f-GO. Further,
in the XRD pattern of PFGN0.5 (Figure 3b), a broad peak was observed in the range of 15°–30°
without the distinctive intense peak of f-GO. These peaks disappeared
in nanocomposites because of the strong interaction of finely dispersed
f-GO with the polar functional groups of pristine polyester, hyperbranched
epoxy, and hardener, which reduces its crystallinity because of the
masking effect since the quantity is very low.23 The SAED pattern of PFGN1 (Figure 4) further confirmed the amorphous nature
of f-GO in the nanocomposites. TEM analysis was performed to further
explore the morphology and dispersion of GO in the polyester matrix.
The well dispersion of f-GO in the nanocomposite without any aggregation
and the occurrence of thin layers of edge-folded f-GO sheets were
visualized from the TEM micrograph of PFGN1 (Figures 4 and 5). Further,
SEM images of the fractured surface of the nanocomposite are shown
in Figure 5, which
also provides dispersion characteristics of f-GO in the polyester
matrix.

2.4 Curing
of the Nanocomposite
The thermosets
of the polyester nanocomposite were obtained by curing it with glycerol-based
hyperbranched epoxy and hardener such as poly(amido amine) at elevated
temperatures in a hot oven. The obtained films of the nanocomposite
were dark brown in color. The presence of varieties of reactive polar
functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxylic, epoxy, and so forth,
in the system made the mechanism of the curing process complex. As
a result, different reactions occurred between them, and the plausible
cross-linking interactions are shown in Scheme 3. The primary amine groups of the hardener
opened the epoxy ring of hyperbranched epoxy of glycerol, leading
to the generation of secondary amine and −OH groups. The free
hydroxyl groups of the nanocomposite interacted with epoxide groups
of hyperbranched epoxy. The hydrogen bonding was formed between −C=O
of the polyester with the hydroxyl group of f-GO and hyperbranched
epoxy. The transesterification reactions between ester and hydroxyl
groups can also occur. Further, the free hydroxyl groups of f-GO and
polyester interact with the amino group of the hardener. Furthermore,
the etherification reaction of hydroxyl and epoxy may also take place.
The different reactions among epoxide groups of hyperbranched epoxy,
carboxylic, and hydroxyl groups of the nanocomposite and f-GO and
amino groups of the poly(amido amine) hardener could also occur.23,24

2.5 Performance Characteristics
The main
aim of incorporating GO into the WHP matrix is to address its poor
mechanical properties. The factors such as particle–particle
interactions and nanoparticle–matrix interactions play a key
role in the performance of the nanocomposite. The attraction forces
between particles influence the particle–particle interaction
and weaken the performance of the nanocomposite. The attraction and
repulsion forces can be controlled by the particle size, particle
volume fraction, particle surface modification, particle weight fraction,
and so forth.21 The enhanced mechanical
properties can be achieved through stronger interfacial interactions
between nanomaterials and the polymer matrix.8,12,24,25 The different
mechanical properties such as scratch hardness, tensile strength,
elongation at break, impact resistance, toughness, and so forth, of
WHP and WHP/f-GO nanocomposites with different loadings of f-GO were
evaluated, and the values are summarized in Table 1. The stress–strain profiles of the
nanocomposite (Figure 6a) showed the relationship between f-GO loading and tensile strength
of the nanocomposite. The mechanical behavior of the nanocomposites
apparently exhibited an enhancing trend upon loading f-GO. From Table 1, it is seen that
the nanocomposite showed significant enhancement in tensile strength
compared to the pristine polyester. The enhancement can be ascribed
to the well dispersion of f-GO in the polyester matrix and the existence
of covalent bonding among the polyester matrix and f-GO along with
various secondary interactions. These help to construct sturdy interfacial
interactions between the polyester matrix and homogeneously dispersed
f-GO. The presence of such interactions resulted in the partially
restricted polymer phase, and the orientation of the polymer chain
and f-GO along the route of the tensile flow greatly contributes to
the observed enrichment of the tensile strength. Further, these properties
were found to be dose-dependent, and the values increased with the
increase in the loading of f-GO. Increase in particle loading leads
to creation of more nanodimensional interfaces that may generate a
strong polymer network enhancing the mechanical properties. Nanocomposites
with the highest f-GO loading (1 wt %) exhibited the highest tensile
strength (39 MPa), corresponding to an enhancement of 5 times that
of pristine polyester. The values were higher than those of the reported
polyester nanocomposites such as polyester resin/GO16 and epoxy/GO,26 and so forth.
Further, it is most interesting to observe that the nanocomposites
not only exhibited higher tensile strength but also improved elongation
at break over the pristine system. The values further increased with
the increase in the loadings of f-GO in the nanocomposites. This increment
is owing to the slippage of the graphene sheets when they are directly
linked to the polymeric chains, as shown in Scheme 4. In addition, on application of extended
tensile force, the immobilized or partially mobilized polymeric chains
are able to elongate fully, and hence, a good enrichment of elongation
can be monitored. The values of elongation at break were found to
be higher than those of the nanocomposites such as polyester/GO,16 epoxy/GO,26 knit
polyester fabric/GO,27 and so forth, reported
in the literature. Furthermore, toughness of the nanocomposite as
calculated from stress–strain curves was also enhanced. This
is the result of the combined effect of strength and flexibility,
and the values are also increased with the loading of f-GO. Further,
other mechanical properties such as impact resistance as well as scratch
hardness of the nanocomposite were also found to be enhanced. The
enhanced mechanical properties could be owing to the good interfacial
interactions upon the homogeneous dispersion of f-GO in the polyester
matrix. There is a chance of direct linkages among various oxygen-containing
groups of f-GO and the polyester by physicochemical interactions.
This significantly enhances the compatibility of f-GO with the polyester
matrix, which facilitates the direct transfer stress to f-GO. This
improves the strength of the nanocomposite. Furthermore, the values
of Young’s modulus are calculated from the slope of the elastic
region of the stress–strain curves, and the values are given
in Table 1. On the
introduction of f-GO, the values of Young’s modulus were found
to be enhanced because of the chain stiffening effect which is further
increased with the loadings of f-GO.

The well-established
Halpin–Tsai model can be utilized for
the prediction of Young’s modulus of a composite system, where
the reinforcing agent was distributed either randomly or parallelly.28−30 The same may be employed for the prediction of Young’s modulus
of graphene-based nanocomposites where graphene nanosheets may be
aligned parallel or distributed randomly. To estimate the Young’s
modulus of such nanocomposites, the following equations were utilized.28−30Eqs 1 and 2 were used for randomly distributed and parallelly aligned
nanosheet-based nanocomposites, respectively. 1   2  where ηL = [(EGO/EP – 1)/(EGO/EP + ζ)],
ηT = [(EGO/EP – 1)/(EGO/EP + 2)], ENC, EP, and EGO are the
Young’s moduli of the nanocomposite, pristine polyester, and
GO, respectively, ζ is the diameter to thickness ratio, and VC is volume fraction of GO. The density and
Young’s modulus of GO were 2.2 g cm–3 and
215 GPa, respectively, as reported in the literature.28 The density of WHP was evaluated as 1.12 g cm–3, and the calculated Young’s moduli of the WHP nanocomposites
were compared with the experimental obtained results at different
GO concentrations, and they are shown in Figure 6b. From this figure, it is clear that the
experimental modulus values are much closer to the theoretical results
of parallelly aligned nanosheets compared to randomly distributed
ones. This result demonstrated that the graphene nanosheets in the
studied nanocomposites are mostly aligned in the parallel direction.

2.6 Thermal Properties
The thermal behaviors
of the nanocomposite as well as GO and f-GO are presented in Figure 7a. GO is thermally unstable owing to the presence
of a huge number of oxygeneous functional groups such as carboxyl,
carbonyl, and hydroxyl, and its TGA curve revealed a two-step degradation
pattern (Figure 7a).
The weight loss near 100 °C is attributed to the evaporation
of absorbed water molecules.2 The first
step degradation at 178 °C is owing to the loss of epoxy, hydroxyl,
and carboxylic groups as well as residual water molecules. The next
step of degradation (430–520 °C) is due to the pyrolysis
of the remaining oxygeneous functional groups yielding CO, CO2, and H2O vapors, as well as due to the decomposition
of the ring carbon.8,31 The thermal degradation temperature
of GO was slightly increased after functionalization, which indicates
that the thermally labile oxygeneous functional groups took part in
the functionalization process (Figure 7a). Further, the degradation temperature of the nanocomposites
was shifted to temperatures higher than those of the pristine system
as well as f-GO (Figure 7b). This signifies good dispersion of f-GO in the polyester matrix
and strong interactions between them, thereby resulting in significant
enrichment of the thermal stability. The thermostability of the nanocomposites
was further enhanced with the increased f-GO loading. This is due
to the fact that through the various physicochemical interactions
with f-GO, the polymer chain motions are restricted. The enhancement
in thermostability can be ascribed to the so-called “complicated
path” effect of graphene platelets. GO acts as a barrier in
the polymer matrix to delay the escape of volatile degradation products
and retards the propagation of heat from the extraneous surroundings
into the polyester matrix.8,31 Further, the glass
transition temperature (Tg) of the nanocomposite
was evaluated from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis,
as shown in Figure 7c. The nanocomposite showed two different Tg values, one in the range of 42–55 °C which is
due to α-transition and another, sub Tg, at a lower temperature (0–9 °C) which is due
to β-transition. More confined polymer chains in the nanocomposites
were achieved because of the strong interfacial interaction which
led to a significant change in the Tg and
contributed to the detection of the second glass transition. In α-transition,
local segments of the polymer become mobile, while β-transition
is resulted because of the side group motions or other types of in-chain
motion. This demonstrated a measurable chain segmental motion which
exists as a secondary relaxation process in the polymer chain. The
segments such as ester linkages and aliphatic moieties actually took
part in such β-transition. Tg of
the nanocomposite slightly increased after the incorporation of f-GO
and further increased with the loading of f-GO, indicating the restriction
of the mobility of polymer chains. This restriction may be due to
different physicochemical interactions of the polyester matrix with
the nanomaterial.32−34

DSC curves

2.7 Biodegradation Study
Most interestingly,
apart from the enhancement in mechanical and thermal properties arising
from the incorporation of GO, the corresponding nanocomposite showed
a noticeable biodegradation behavior against the Pseudomonas
aeruginosa bacterial strain. The bacterial growth
profiles for the nanocomposites obtained after 45 days are shown in Figure 8a. All the nanocomposites
demonstrated significant bacterial growth against P.
aeruginosa with time. The factors such as flexible
moieties, amorphous nature of the polyester, polar linkages, and hydrophilic
character are mainly responsible for such biodegradation.35,36 In the case of polyester, the major mode of degradation is a hydrolytic
random chain scission. The degradation involves various phenomena
of diffusion reaction, including ester hydrolysis, solubilization
of soluble species, water absorption, and diffusion. Further, the
ester cleavage is auto-catalyzed by end groups of carboxylic acid
originally present in the polymer or nanomaterials or produced by
hydrolytic degradation. The representative SEM images (Figure 8b–e) of PFGN0.5 demonstrated
the morphologies of the nanocomposite before and after biodegradation
and established broad surface erosion after degradation. However,
the degree of degradation of polyester in the vicinity of the graphene
sheets is less compared to the bulk. GO itself is nondegradable, but
its incorporation in the polyester matrix has a marginal effect on
the overall biodegradability of the nanocomposite.23,35 This is due to the increase of polar and flexible linkages including
ester linkages which are prone to microbial attacks. Further, the
hydrophilic character and the amorphous nature are the key factors
responsible for this biodegradability.23 Though GO reduces the enzymatic hydrolysis rate in biodegradation,36 in this case, the effect was not observed, as
no enzyme was directly used during the biodegradation study. Further,
because of the functionalization of GO, this effect was not noticed
though some enzymes may be released during the degradation process.

2.8 Nanocomposites
as a Catalyst for Aza-Michael
Addition Reaction
The nanocomposite was used as a catalyst
for the addition of an N–H bond across a multiple bond to give
important nitrogen-containing compounds. The reaction between diethylamine
and acrylonitrile was carried out using different catalyst systems
(Table S1, Supporting Information). The
reaction was completed with highest conversion (98%) within 3 min
using PFGN1 as a catalyst. The yield was found to be higher than that
reported for GO-based catalytic reaction.18 The aza-Michael addition reaction in the presence of GO is favorable
because of the presence of oxygeneous functional groups in its surface
which play a role in the activation of this reaction. Thus, the observed
higher yield of the reaction by the nanocomposite is due to the presence
of a huge number of functional groups than bare GO and f-GO. Further,
the catalyst (PFGN1) concentration was optimized by varying its concentration
from 0.00125 to 0.05 g (Table S2 of the Supporting Information, entry 1–5). The enhancement in the yield
of the product was observed with the increase in the loading of the
catalyst amount. This is due to the increase in the GO concentration
with the increase in the loading of PFGN1, and hence, the increase
in the number of oxygeneous functional groups showed an excellent
result. Further, the reaction was studied using different amines with
different α,β-unsaturated compounds under described conditions
to obtain the desired products. The reactants were converted to the
corresponding β-amino compounds without the formation of any
byproducts with excellent yields within the short reaction time. These
results are given in Table 2. The obtained products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy,
and the corresponding NMR spectra of the products are provided in
the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S3)
and compared with the reported literature.

condition: amine (1 mmol),
α,β unsaturated compound (1.2 mmol), and the desired amount
of the catalyst were stirred under daylight at room temperature.

Further, recovery of the catalyst
is a key factor to determine whether it has the potential for large-scale
application in the industry or not. Thus, the recyclability of the
catalyst was studied using the same aza-Michael addition reaction
of acrylonitrile and diethylamine as a model reaction, and the results
provided in the Supporting Information,
Table S3. The catalyst was easily recovered by simple filtration after
completion of the reaction. However, in the reported reaction by GO,
the catalyst was recovered by extraction with dichloromethane from
the reaction mixture.18 Thus, the aza-Michael
addition reaction in the presence of the nanocomposite has an added
advantage than the reported GO nanoparticle.18 It is seen from Table S3 that the yield
of the product was found to be constant upto the fourth cycle during
the recycling process, establishing the efficient recyclability of
the catalyst.

Thus, the nanocomposite is an efficient heterogeneous
catalyst
for the synthesis of different amino-substituted compounds through
the aza-Michael addition of α,β unsaturated compounds
and amines. Further, it was also easily recoverable as well as recyclable
with the constant catalytic activity.

3 Conclusions
The present study established a facile, green,
and eco-friendly
in situ fabrication method to obtain a sustainable tough WHP thermosetting
nanocomposite with functionalized GO. More interestingly, this sustainable
material was fabricated from biobased raw materials, and the process
does not involve any additional catalyst and compatibilizing agent.
Furthermore, such a facile approach provides opportunity to produce
high-performing nanocomposites in a large scale. The nanocomposite
exhibited significant enhancement in mechanical and thermal properties
at a low nanomaterial loading. In addition, the nanocomposite showed
a biodegradation behavior toward the P. aeruginosa bacterial strain. This nanocomposite can be utilized as an efficient
heterogeneous catalyst for the aza-Michael addition reaction. Thus,
the study stimulates new opportunities for the fabrication of waterborne
polymer/graphene nanocomposites for a wide range of potential applications.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
Glycerol
(Merck, Germany),
citric acid (Merck, Germany), BD (Merck, Germany), 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-200, Mn = 200 g/mol, Merck, Mumbai) were used after
drying in a vacuum oven. Graphite flakes (60 mesh, purity 99%, Loba
Chemie, India), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%,
Merck, India), concentrated sulfuric acid (98%, Merck, India), TDI
(Merck, Germany), potassium permanganate (KMnO4, Analytical
Rasayan, India), diethylamine (Merck, Mumbai), methyl methacrylate
(Sigma-Aldrich) acrylonitrile (SRL, Mumbai), aniline (Sigma-Aldrich),
and poly(amido amine) hardener (Asian Paints, Mumbai, amine value
5–7 equiv/kg) were used as received. The other reagent grade
chemicals were used in this study without further purification.

4.2 Functionalization of GO
Functionalization
of GO consists of two steps. In the first step, GO was prepared according
to the well-established Hummers method8 by the oxidation of graphite using sulfuric acid (concentrated)
and KMnO4. The resultant suspension of GO was centrifuged
repeatedly and washed by dilute HCl solution. Further, ultrasonically,
the exfoliated GO was made water-dispersible and dried in a vacuum
oven. This GO was functionalized in the second step by the following
method. Functionalization was done by reacting GO with a requisite
amount of TDI and BD. In brief, 0.5 g of GO was dispersed in 25 mL
of THF by mechanical shearing followed by sonication. The dispersed
GO was placed in a three-necked flask outfitted with a Teflon septum,
mechanical stirrer, and nitrogen inlet. TDI (0.82 mmol) was added
dropwise into the abovementioned GO suspension at room temperature.
The reaction was again continued at 70 ± 4 °C for 2–3
h to achieve the isocyanate-terminated GO. Then, BD (0.41 mmol) was
added into the abovementioned mixture, and the reaction was further
continued for another 1 h, which resulted in the desired functionalized
GO (f-GO). The free reactants/components were separated by centrifuging
and washing f-GO with THF. The obtained f-GO was dried in a vacuum
oven.

4.3 Fabrication of WHP/f-GO Nanocomposites
WHP nanocomposites were fabricated using different amounts of f-GO
for the first time through an in situ technique without using a compatibilizing
agent and an organic solvent. The first step of this fabrication process
was the reaction of citric acid and PEG-200 at 140 °C for 1 h,
which resulted in the prepolymer. In the second step, the requisite
amount of bis-MPA and glycerol was added to it along with the required
amount of f-GO after cooling this reaction mixture to 60 °C,
and then, again the reaction was carried out at 140 °C. This
product can be diluted by water to the desired extent. Further, to
achieve the thermosetting nanocomposite, the resultant polyester nanocomposite
was mixed with hyperbranched epoxy and poly(amido amine) hardener
homogeneously at room temperature in the ratio of 1:0.5:0.25 by wt.
The mixture was cast on glass plates and cured at 150 °C for
a specified time period. The cured films were peeled out by using
warm water and used for mechanical testing after conditioning for
48 h. Three different compositions of nanocomposites were fabricated
using different wt % (0.1, 0.5 and 1) f-GO by following the similar
preparative protocol, and they are denoted as PFGN0.1, PFGN0.5, and
PFGN1, respectively. The nanocomposite of polyester with GO (0.1 wt
%) was also prepared for comparison purposes and coded as PGN0.1.

4.4 Characterization
The nanomaterials
and nanocomposites were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques
as used earlier for the characterization of the carbon dot-based polyester
nanocomposite.24

4.5 Biodegradation
Study
A biodegradation
study was performed using the McFarland turbidity method against P. aeruginosa as the bacterial strain,40,41 and the detail method is given in the Supporting Information.

4.6 Method for the Aza-Michael
Addition Reaction
The nanocomposite was tested as a heterogeneous
catalyst for the
aza-Michael addition reaction (Scheme S1). A mixture of 1.2 mmol of α,β-unsaturated compound
and 1 mmol of the amine substrate was stirred at room temperature
in the presence of 0.0025 g of catalyst (PFGN1). The completion of
the reaction was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography, and the product
was extracted from the reaction mixture using ethyl acetate. The catalyst
was recovered by simple filtering after completion of the first cycle.
Further, to check the recyclability of the catalyst for this reaction,
a set of experiments was performed.
