The
α-glucosidase encoded by the aglA gene
of Aspergillus niger is a secreted
enzyme belonging to family 31 of glycoside hydrolases. This enzyme
has a retaining mechanism of action and displays transglycosylating
activity that makes it amenable to be used for the synthesis of isomaltooligosaccharides
(IMOs). We have expressed the aglA gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under control of a galactose-inducible
promoter. Recombinant yeast cells expressing the aglA gene produced extracellular α-glucosidase activity about half
of which appeared cell bound whereas the other half was released into
the culture medium. With maltose as the substrate, panose is the main
transglycosylation product after 8 h of incubation, whereas isomaltose
is predominant after 24 h. Isomaltose also becomes predominant at
shorter times if a mixture of maltose and glucose is used instead
of maltose. To facilitate IMO production, we have designed a procedure
by which yeast cells can be used directly as the catalytic agent.
For this purpose, we expressed in S. cerevisiae gene constructs in which the aglA gene is fused
to glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor sequences, from the yeast SED1 gene, that determine the covalent binding of the hybrid
protein to the cell membrane. The resulting hybrid enzymes were stably
attached to the cell surface. The cells from cultures of recombinant
yeast strains expressing aglA-SED1 constructions
can be used to produce IMOs in successive batches.

Introduction
Oligosaccharides
are important compounds for the food and pharmaceutical
industries because of their growing use as prebiotics and antioxidants
and for drug delivery.1 A relevant type
of oligosaccharides are isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs), roughly defined
from a chemical point of view as short glucose oligomers (between
two and nine units) containing α-(1→6), α-(1→3),
or α-(1→2) linkages. Examples are isomaltose, panose,
isomaltotriose, nigerosylglucose, and kojibiosylglucose, among others.
While α-(1→4) linkages that constitute the backbone of
starch and glycogen molecules are readily digested by intestinal enzymes,
α-(1→6) linkages, as well as α-(1→3) and
α-(1→2), are not so easily hydrolyzed, one of the characteristics
that confer to these compounds their recognized status of prebiotics.2,3

Enzymatic synthesis has become a preferred procedure for oligosaccharide
production over alternative chemical synthesis or polysaccharide hydrolysis.
Transferases and retaining glycoside hydrolases which are naturally
endowed with transferase activity and do not require activated substrates
are generally used.1 In the specific case
of IMO synthesis, the enzymes used are dextransucrases or alternansucrases
from lactic acid bacteria, or fungal transferases and α-glucosidases.2−6 The use of glycoside hydrolases, belonging to family GH31, for IMO
synthesis is possible because these are retaining enzymes, whose catalytic
mechanism allows them to act as transferases. The reactions mediated
by these enzymes comprise two consecutive steps. In the first one,
a nucleophilic residue (Asp or Glu) attacks a glycosidic bond, forming
a covalent bond with the split glycoside. In the second step, another
(acid/base) catalytic residue (again Asp or Glu) mediates the transference
of the glycosyl moiety to an acceptor molecule, most commonly water,
in which case hydrolysis is accomplished. If a molecule other than
water, frequently the glycoside substrate itself, acts as the acceptor,
the result of the reaction is a transglycosylation. The structure
of a glycoside hydrolase enzyme, in particular its catalytic center,
determines its transglycosylating activity, its preference for specific
acceptors, and therefore the pattern of transglycosylation products
that it may produce.7−11

IMO synthesizing capability has been reported for the α-glucosidase
produced by Aspergillus niger. Panose
and isomaltose are the main transglycosylation products when maltose
is used as the substrate.12−15 Both glycosides show prebiotic properties16,17 and can be used as low calorie sweeteners.4,18 Therefore,
the development of efficient procedures for large scale synthesis
of IMOs is a significant biotechnological goal. The cost of IMO production
at the industrial level is largely determined by enzyme production,
recovery and purification. A simpler and cheaper alternative relies
on the direct use of the producer microorganism in a “one pot”
process.19 To apply this concept to the
production of IMOs, we have constructed Saccharomyces
cerevisiae strains that display A.
niger α-glucosidase covalently attached to the
cell surface. Our results show that the engineered yeast provides
an efficient procedure for the production of panose and isomaltose
with high yield.

Results
Expression of A. niger aglA Gene in S. cerevisiae
S. cerevisiae BY4741, used
as the host strain, is isogenic to the wild type S288C.
It carries in its genome functional genes encoding maltose permease
(AGT1 and MAL31) and intracellular
α-glucosidase (MAL12 and MAL32) but lacks a gene (MAL13 or MAL33) encoding the activator protein required for the expression of the
permease and the glucosidase.20,21 Consequently, strain
BY4741 is phenotypically maltose negative, a desirable characteristic
because it avoids interference with the analysis of heterologous enzyme
activity.

Galactose induced cultures of strain BY4741 transformed
with plasmid pSSP-AG harboring the aglA gene showed
α-glucosidase activity, ca. 1.4 mU/mL, almost equally distributed
between the supernatant fraction (53%) and cell-bound (47%). A control
culture of the same strain transformed with the cloning vector, assayed
as a control, showed no detectable enzyme activity. Production of
secreted α-glucosidase by the aglA yeast transformant
could be visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) as a diffused protein band of high molecular mass (above
240 kDa), indicating a high degree of glycosylation (Figure 1, lane C). The protein mass
decreased to ca. 135 kDa, after treatment with Endo H (Figure 1, lane D). This indicates effective
albeit not complete deglycosylation because the expected mass of the
protein monomer, as deduced from the amino acid sequence, is 106 kDa.

(A,B) and with (B,D) or without (A,C) treatment with Endo H glycosidase.
The arrows point differential bands present in the pSSP-AG-transformed
strain, which produces extracellular α-glucosidase activity.

Analysis of IMO Formation
Figure 2 shows the
products recovered from the incubation
of S. cerevisiae cells, expressing
the aglA gene with 30% maltose as the substrate.
After 8 h incubation, the only reaction product present at a significant
concentration was panose. This trisaccharide is formed by transglycosylation
between two maltose molecules, one of them acting as the glucosyl
donor and the other as the acceptor. The glucosyl residue from the
donor maltose is transferred to the acceptor, forming an α-(1→6)
linkage. It is noteworthy that the absence of glucose, despite the
fact that panose and glucose are produced at equimolar concentrations
in the transglucosylation reaction, indicates that the monosaccharide
is consumed by the yeast during this initial period. After 24 h incubation,
the predominant transglycosylation product is isomaltose, with lower
but significant amounts of panose and isomaltotriose. At this stage,
maltose is detectable although in residual amounts. Glucose accumulates,
likely as the cells are no longer metabolically active after such
an extended incubation period at 50 °C. Other unidentified peaks
eluting at higher retention times likely correspond to α-(1→6)
IMOs of higher degrees of polymerization.

Figure 2 Product profile of S. cerevisiae BY4741 [pSSP-AG] and the control strain,
after incubation with maltose.
Cells were incubated with 30% maltose at 50 °C for different
times, and the sugars recovered in the supernatant fraction were analyzed
by HPLC. (A) Molecular standards and (B,C) BY4741 [pSSP-AG] after
8 and 24 h, respectively. (D) Control strain, after 8 h. The peaks
in the chromatogram of the standards correspond to: (1) glucose, (2)
isomaltose, (3) isomaltotriose, (4) maltose, (5) panose, and (6) maltotriose.

Time course of IMO production
at different concentrations of maltose
was monitored. Figure 3A shows that panose production increases rapidly, at similar rates
for different maltose concentrations, up to a maximum (400 mM after
20 h for 60% maltose), and then decreases. As it could be expected,
maltose kinetics showed an initial linear decay with similar slopes
for different substrate concentrations (Figure 3B). Isomaltose and glucose formation was
only detectable using the higher maltose concentrations at long incubation
times (Figure 3C,D).
After an initial delay, both products were progressively accumulated.
The fact that isomaltose was only formed upon glucose accumulation
suggests that isomaltose is formed by transglycosylation with glucose
as the acceptor molecule and not by a possible alternative mechanism
(i.e. isomerization). Moreover, such a delay in isomaltose synthesis
compared to panose production was not observed when using a purified
enzyme, in which glucose is not sequestered from the medium.12,13

M), orange triangles. The resulting sugars were analyzed by HPLC.

Figure 4 shows a
model of A. niger α-glucosidase
with isomaltose and panose docked at the active site of A. niger α-glucosidase. The model was adjusted
to superimpose the orientation of the catalytic residues (Asp490 and
Asp660, putative nucleophile and acid/base catalytic residues) with
the corresponding residues of sugar beet α-glucosidase (PDB
id 3WEO). We
assume that the disposition of the catalytic residues must be the
same in both proteins because they catalyze the same reaction, and
the degree of sequence identity (37%) becomes nearly 80% if only the
residues likely involved in direct interaction with the substrate
are considered. The model shows the formation of isomaltose and panose
and suggests a site for the coupling of the acceptor molecule (glucose
or maltose).

end is colored in pink. Putative hydrogen bonds with this residue
are highlighted with dashed lines.

Anchoring of AglA to the S. cerevisiae Cell Surface
Transformant cultures of strain BY4741, expressing
the aglA gene, secrete α-glucosidase which
appears distributed approximately in equal amounts, in the cell-bound
and the supernatant fractions of the culture. This makes the recovery
of the enzyme in useful amounts for IMO synthesis difficult. Attachment
of the enzyme to the yeast cell surface allows a direct use of the
yeast biomass as the catalytic agent, a methodology that has been
reported for the production of other oligosaccharides.19 Therefore, we carried out two constructions
in which AglA was fused to full length or partial versions of S. cerevisiae Sed1. This is an abundant, stress-induced,
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall protein, proved to
be useful for the attachment of proteins to the yeast cell wall.22−24Figure 5A shows that
in contrast to the strain that expressed the aglA gene in the two strains producing hybrid AglA-Sed1 α-glucosidase,
the enzyme activity appeared attached to the cells, with no significant
activity detected as the free enzyme in the culture supernatant. The
strain expressing the hybrid with the shorter version of Sed1 (AglA_Sed1B)
showed higher α-glucosidase activity than that with the full-length
Sed1 (AglA_Sed1A). A practical consequence of the covalent attachment
of the enzyme to the cell surface is reported in Figure 5B. The cells expressing Sed1
hybrid α-glucosidase can be reused in consecutive reaction batches
without major reduction of activity.

Synthesis of Panose or
Isomaltose by Transglycosylation as a
Function of the Glucosyl Acceptor
As it has been mentioned
before, the results reported in Figure 3 indicate that both maltose and glucose can act as
glucosyl acceptors in the transglycosylation reaction. Thus, when
maltose is used as the substrate, at shorter reaction times, maltose
is the only available acceptor yielding panose as the transglycosylation
product. As the reaction progresses, the glucose concentration increases,
becoming available as the acceptor to produce isomaltose. To confirm
that isomaltose is formed by transglycosylation with glucose as the
acceptor, and not by the direct isomerization of maltose, we assayed
the production of IMOs, at different initial ratios of glucose to
maltose (Figure 6).
For this analysis, yeast transformants expressing AglA_Sed1B were
preincubated at 50 °C during 24 h to avoid the interference of
glucose consumption by cell metabolism. Because this α-glucosidase
is stably attached to the cell surface and remains active (Figure 5B), pretreated cells
with an attenuated metabolism could be used as the enzyme source.
Compared to the previous experiment (Figure 3), cell pretreatment at 50 °C allowed,
after 5 h of incubation with maltose, a higher accumulation of glucose
(ca. 200 mM) and a higher yield of isomaltose (ca. 60 mM), even in
the absence of exogenously added glucose. An increase in the glucose
concentration is not expected to enhance the isomaltose production
if this disaccharide is formed by isomerization of maltose. Therefore,
positive correlation between isomaltose production and initial glucose
concentration (compare Figures 6A and 3C) indicates a transglycosylation
mechanism. Using pretreated cells, after 1 h incubation with maltose,
the ratio of isomaltose to panose was 0.2 and the ratio of glucose
to maltose had the same value. When the initial ratio of glucose to
maltose was increased (Figure 6), the panose yield decreased while isomaltose increased.
In both cases, the ratio of isomaltose to panose after 1 h incubation
was equivalent to that of glucose to maltose. These results suggest
that glucose and maltose compete for the same binding site in the
enzyme, acting as acceptors of the glucosyl residue, to synthesize
isomaltose and panose, respectively. However, both products showed
different kinetics at longer incubation times. Although panose reached
a maximum concentration before being degraded (Figures 3A and 6B), isomaltose
was progressively accumulated (Figure 6A), indicating that panose is a better substrate for
the enzyme.

Figure 6 Kinetics of isomaltose (A) and panose (B) production. The reactions
were carried out by incubation of pretreated cells (at 50 °C,
pH 5.5 for 24 h) of transformant yeast strain (AglA-Sed1B) with different
amounts of maltose and glucose: 300 mM maltose (blue squares), 300
mM maltose and 300 mM of glucose (orange circles), and 300 mM of maltose
and 1.2 M of glucose (green triangles).

Discussion
Industrial production of IMOs is carried
out by the combined action
of hydrolytic and transferase enzymes on starch, which yields a complex
mixture of α-glucosides.4,25,26 Although in general terms, IMOs are considered to have prebiotic
and other health promoting properties,3,6,27 the heterogeneous and variable nature or commercial
preparations makes it difficult to ascribe observed effects to specific
compounds. The development of new procedures for the production of
IMOs of defined composition, specifically, panose and isomaltose,
is a significant biotechnological goal because of present and potential
applications of these compounds.18,28,29 Our results provide a procedure for inexpensive,
food-grade production of panose and isomaltose, using an engineered
yeast strain that displays a cell wall-linked α-glucosidase.
The production of panose or isomaltose can be modulated by the ratio
of the acceptor sugars (maltose or glucose) present in the reaction.

A conclusion derived from our results is that the formation of
isomaltose takes place by transglycosylation and not by intramolecular
isomerization of maltose. The enzyme-bound glucosyl residue formed
as a reaction intermediate can be transferred to the acceptor molecule,
either glucose or maltose, to synthesize isomaltose or panose, respectively.
This is a significant result because other retaining glycosyl hydrolases
have isomerase activity. For example, trehalose synthase catalyzes
the isomerization of maltose to trehalose through an intramolecular
isomerization of the substrate, whereas the enzyme is unable to incorporate
exogenously added glucose.30 A conspicuous
case is that of the LacZ α-galactosidase from Escherichia coli. This enzyme converts lactose into
allolactose through an isomerization reaction, in which glucose and
galactose, resulting from the hydrolysis of lactose, are bound again,
through a different linkage, before leaving the active site.31 LacZ is also able to catalyze transglycosylation
of a galactosyl moiety to exogenous glucose added at high concentrations.
The mechanistic difference between isomerization and transglycosylation
is important from a biotechnological point of view. If isomaltose
synthesis was carried out by isomerization, isomaltose would be formed
together with panose. However, our results show that in the absence
of glucose, panose is the sole transglycosylation product. On the
other hand, increasing the glucose concentration displaces the mechanism
toward the production of isomaltose.

Panose and isomaltose yield
at different ratios of glucose to maltose
indicate that both maltose and glucose compete with efficiency similar
to glucosyl acceptors. However, once formed, the fate of the two products
is notably different. Although panose reaches a maximum and then declines,
isomaltose keeps increasing (Figure 6). This result is explained by the higher affinity
of AglA for panose as a substrate for hydrolysis, compared to isomaltose.12 Structural modeling of A. niger α-glucosidase with panose docked at the active site supports
this observation. As shown in Figure 4, the glucosyl residue at the reducing end of panose
may form three putative hydrogen bonds to D225, S495, and H596. This
would represent an additional stabilization for the formation of the
enzyme–substrate complex, as compared to the isomaltose molecule,
which is equivalent to panose except for this glucosyl end. These
three residues are conserved in the α-glucosidase from Schwanniomyces occidentalis, which has a product
profile similar to that of AglA.7 Interestingly,
H596 is substituted by Ser in the α-glucosidase from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, which synthesizes
panose and maltotriose with similar efficiencies.5 This suggests that the subsite represented by these residues
is involved in the product specificity of the enzyme.

In conclusion,
this study presents a simple procedure to synthesize
IMOs (specifically, panose and isomaltose) with high yield. The cell
surface display system used here allows the implementation of a one-pot
procedure by which yeast biomass can be used and recycled as the catalytic
agent for IMO production.

Materials and Methods
Microbial Strains and Culture
Media
Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 (MATa AGT1 MAL12 mal13Δ MAL31 MAL32 mal33Δ his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), used as the
yeast host strain, is isogenic to the standard wild type S288C (http://www.yeastgenome.org). A. niger CECT 2775 was obtained
from Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo (http://cect.org). Composition of complete
(yeast extract peptone dextrose, YPD) and minimal (synthetic defined)
media is described by Sherman.32

Cloning
Procedures
The A. nigeraglA gene (GenBank: D45356.1) encodes an α-glucosidase
(EC 3.2.1.20) belonging to family 31 of glycoside hydrolases. For
cloning of this gene, A. niger was
cultured in liquid YPD for 36 h at 26 °C. The mycelium was recovered
by filtration, frozen, and disrupted by grinding in liquid nitrogen
with a mortar and pestle. RNA was isolated using RNA PLUS (MP Biomedicals),
based on a procedure described by Chomczynski and Sacchi.33 Reverse transcription was carried out with the
SuperScript III First-Strand Kit (Invitrogen). The coding gene sequence,
excluding its signal peptide, was amplified from the complimentary
DNA using primers 2MC70 (forward): CTGTCTAGAGCGAGCCAGTCACTCTTATC (XbaI site underlined) and 2MC71 (reverse):
TCACAAGCTTTTACCATTCCAATACCCAGTTTTCC (HindIII
site underlined). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned in NheI/HindIII
sites of plasmid pSSP-GOX, a modified version of the yeast expression
vector pEMBLyex4, that carries the coding region of the STA1 gene signal peptide,34,35 under control of a galactose
inducible promoter (CYC-GAL). The resulting plasmid (pSSP-AG) was
used to transform S. cerevisiae BY4741.
The same yeast strain was also transformed with vector pEMBLyex4 to
be used as a negative control.

Hybrid genes of A. nigeraglA and S. cerevisiaeSED1 were constructed
as follows. The coding sequence of the aglA gene
version that includes a 5′ extension corresponding to the S. cerevisiaeSTA1 signal peptide
was amplified with primers 2MC81 (forward): CCAGGATCCATGGTGGGACTTAAGAACCC (BamHI site underlined) and 2MC82 (reverse):
CCTAGTGCATGCAGTGGTCCATTCCAATACCCAGTTTTCC (SphI
site underlined). The STA1-aglA gene was fused to
two versions of the S. cerevisiaeSED1 gene. The first version (SED1A) contains
the entire coding region of the gene (GenBank/NCBI sequence NM_001180385.3), whereas the second one (SED1B) lacks the first
109 aminoacids.22 For SED1_A synthesis, the gene, excluding the initial ATG, was amplified
from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA with
primers 2MC83 (forward): CCTAGTGCATGCAGTGGTAAATTATCAACTGTCCTATTATCTGC
(SphI site underlined) and 2MC84 (reverse): CACAAGCTTTTATAAGAATAACATAGCAACACCAG (HindIII site underlined). SED1B was amplified using primers 2MC85 (forward): CCTAGTGCATGCAGTGGTGCTCTTCCAACTAACGGTAC (SphI site underlined) and 2MC84 (reverse):
CACAAGCTTTTATAAGAATAACATAGCAACACCAG (HindIII
site underlined). The hybrid fusions of STA1-aglA to either SED1A or SED1B were
cloned at BamHI/HindIII sites of pEMBLyex4, under the control of the
CYC-GAL galactose inducible promoter (plasmids pSSP-AG_Sed1A and pSSP-AG_Sed1B,
respectively).

Determination of α-Glucosidase Production
and Activity
Enzyme (α-glucosidase) activity was measured
with p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside
(pNPG)
as the substrate, in cells collected by centrifugation from galactose-induced
cultures of transformed S. cerevisiae strains and in the supernatant of the cultures. Cultures were inoculated
in liquid YPD medium at a cell density equivalent to A600 of ca. 0.5 and cultivated under agitation at 30 °C
up to an A600 of around 2.0. At this point,
galactose was added at 1% final concentration and the cultures were
grown for an additional period of approximately 18 h. Cell and supernatant
fractions of 1 mL aliquots from the induced cultures were separated
by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 250 μL of citrate
phosphate buffer pH 5.5. To 100 μL of sample (either supernatant
or cell fraction), 150 μL of a pNPG solution in citrate phosphate
buffer pH 5.5 was added, making the final concentration of the substrate
1 mM. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. The reactions
were stopped at different time intervals by adding 500 μL of
1 M sodium carbonate. Released p-nitrophenol was
measured spectrophotometrically at A400.

Extracellular α-glucosidase produced by S. cerevisiae was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The
protein in the supernatant of the induced yeast cultures was concentrated
about 65 times by ultrafiltration, using a Pierce protein concentrator
30k (Thermo Scientific). The concentrated protein samples were split
in two and one of them was deglycosylated by treatment with Endo H
(Biolabs) for 16 h at 37 °C in the presence of a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Complete EDTA-free, Roche), whereas the other was incubated
under the same conditions without Endo H. Native, and deglycosylated
protein samples were subjected to acrylamide gel electrophoresis and
silver stained.

IMO Determination
Production of
IMOs was assayed using
maltose, or a mixture of maltose and glucose, as the substrate and S. cerevisiae cells, expressing different versions
of the aglA gene, as the enzyme source. The yeast
cells collected from 10 mL of induced culture were resuspended in
citrate phosphate buffer pH 5.5 with the substrate at different concentrations
and incubated at 50 °C. In the case of yeast transformants expressing
AglA-Sed1 hybrid enzymes, the cells were initially resuspended in
the same buffer without any substrate and incubated at 50 °C
for 24 h to reduce their metabolic activity (glucose consumption).
After this time, the cells were incubated with the substrate (maltose
or a mixture of maltose and glucose) at the same temperature. Samples
were taken at different time intervals. The soluble fraction was collected
by centrifugation and heated at 95 °C for 10 min to stop the
reaction. IMO synthesis was analyzed by ion exchange chromatography
using an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument
equipped with CarbonPac PA100 columns and a pulsed amperometric detector
(Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described.36 Sugars were identified by their chromatographic
retention times. The sugar concentration was calculated by interpolation
of their peak areas. Glucose, isomaltose, isomaltotriose, maltose,
panose, and maltotriose (Sigma) were used as standards.

Protein Structure
Analysis
A structural model of A. niger α-glucosidase was obtained using I-TASSER.37 The model was adjusted to superimpose the orientation
of the putative catalytic residues (D490 and D660, nucleophile and
acid/base, respectively) with the corresponding residues of the sugar
beet α-glucosidase (PDB id 3WEO). The protein structure was analyzed
with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Schrödinger, LLC).
Molecular docking of glucose, panose, and isomaltose was carried out
with Maestro 11 (Schrödinger, LLC), taking as a reference the
interaction of sugar beet α-glucosidase with acarbose.38,39
