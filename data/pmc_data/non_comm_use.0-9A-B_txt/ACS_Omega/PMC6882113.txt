Designing highly stable and reusable
catalytic systems based on
Au nanoparticles (NPs) is a significant challenge in nanocatalysis
research. Here, we have fabricated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibrous
mat/Au NP composite catalysts with NPs in uniform size and good distribution
by use of a developed in situ growth approach. In this method, Au
seeds were first adsorbed on PVA nanofibrous mat surfaces rather than
on relatively large Au NPs and then used to grow NPs in Au seed solution;
thus, the steric hindrance effect was alleviated and a high loading
was used for Au NPs up to 11 wt %. Strong interfacial interactions
between the Au NPs and the PVA nanofibrous mats due to introducing
a large number of hydrogen bonds provide high thermal stability for
the PVA side chains, long-term catalytic stability, and excellent
reusability. Consequently, the proposed in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats produce high catalytic activity for at least 15 cycles over a
30 d period. This work provides a potential approach for fabricating
highly stable and reusable metal NPs on polymer nanofibrous mats to
facilitate a wide variety of applications.

Introduction
Metal nanoparticles
(NPs) have been the subject of increasing interest
because of their importance in the field of nanoscience. Gold NPs,
in particular, are one of the most widely studied NP systems because
of their far-ranging potential applications, such as in catalysis,
sensors, optical devices, energy, and biology.1−10 However, colloidal Au NPs have high surface energy, and not only
readily aggregate but also are difficult to retrieve and reuse in
aqueous or nonaqueous media. Therefore, stabilization is essential
to immobilize Au NPs and prevent their aggregation in most applications,
particularly in catalysis. Stabilization has been facilitated by the
use of numerous carrier systems such as high surface area, high-porosity
materials [e.g., zeolites and mesoporous silica (SBA)], two-dimensional
nanomaterials (e.g., graphene oxide), and a variety of molecules (e.g.,
surfactants and dendrimers).11−32 Recently, environmentally benign polymer nanofibers have attracted
considerable interest as Au NP stabilization carriers because of their
high porosity, high surface area to volume ratios, and degradability
in the environment.30−33 Compared to other high surface area and high-porosity materials
employed as Au NP stabilization carriers for catalytic applications,
electrospun polymer nanofibers can provide a larger number of active
sites, for example, −SH, −COOH, and −NH3+ for stabilizing Au NPs and are much easier for fabrication.34−40 This results in a great variety of interactions for immobilizing
Au NPs on nanofiber surfaces to form polymer/Au NP composite nanofibers,
which have been prepared via the in situ reduction of HAuCl4 carried by polymer nanofibers. For example, Fang et al. demonstrated
the immobilization of Au NPs on the surfaces of water-stable composite
polyvinyl acetate and polyethyleneimine nanofibrous mats.35 However, this approach is unable to control
the size of Au NPs; as a result, the NPs lack uniformity in size,
which is unfavorable for their catalytic activity. Moreover, the distribution
of Au NPs embedded in polymer nanofibers also tends to obstruct free
contact between the reactants and the Au NPs during catalysis, reducing
the catalytic performance. On the other hand, the composite polymer/Au
NP nanofiber catalysts can be fabricated by directly adsorbing Au
NPs on polymer nanofibers via active functional groups (e.g., −NH3+ and −COOH).36,37 This method can stabilize
Au NPs in the controllable size and shape. However, the spatial steric
hindrance effect tends to limit Au NP loading on the outer surfaces
of matted nanofibers and thus leads to a very low loading percentage.
Moreover, the composite polymer/Au NP nanofibers lack long-term catalytic
stability because of a relatively small number of linkage points between
the Au NPs and the polymer nanofibers, accordingly the NPs readily
aggregate over time. An ideal Au NP catalyst-carrier system allows
for the fabrication of Au NPs with uniform sizes, uniform distribution
on the carrier surface, and high loading mass percentage. Moreover,
the fabricated polymer/Au NP catalyst should be stable over a long
period of time and offer good reusability. In short, most routes to
immobilize Au NPs on polymer nanofibers suffer from several drawbacks:
(1) lacking of the long-term stability; (2) low loading amounts; (3)
embedding in the polymer nanofibers which obstructs the reactants
to contact with the Au NPs and thus inhibiting the catalytic properties;
and (4) lacking the uniform size and distribution of Au NPs. Thus,
designing highly effective Au NP catalytic systems with long-term
catalytic stability and reusability is still a challenge and of significant
interest in nanoscience research.

The present study addresses
this challenge by proposing the application
of an environmentally benign, degradable, and water-stable polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) nanofibrous mat carrier system to fabricate the composite
PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mat catalysts. We have overcome these drawbacks
and successfully fabricated the highly stable PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats by in situ growing Au NPs from Au seeds adsorbed on the surfaces
of PVA nanofibrous mats. The Au seeds, rather than relatively large
Au NPs, adsorbed on PVA nanofibrous mat surfaces can alleviate the
steric hindrance effect and thereby increase the Au NP loading up
to 11 wt %. The Au NPs in situ grown from Au seeds are in uniform
size and distribution. Strong interfacial interactions between the
Au NPs and the PVA nanofibrous mats stemmed from a large number of
hydrogen bonds provide high thermal stability, long-term catalytic
stability, and excellent reusability.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 presents
a schematic diagram of the process of fabricating PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mat composites by the in situ growth of Au NPs. Water-stable PVA nanofibrous
mats were prepared via an electrospinning process by adding glutaraldehyde
(GA) into the PVA solution as a cross-linking agent. First, the water-stable
PVA nanofibrous mats were placed in a diluted Au seed solution with
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The pH of the solution
was adjusted to 3 to activate the hydroxyl groups of PVA for adsorbing
the Au seeds in the solution via the CTAB adsorbed on the PVA and
Au seed surfaces. Second, the PVA/CTAB composite nanofibrous mats
with Au seeds were added to the growth solution including CTAB, HAuCl4, and ascorbic acid. Then the adsorbed Au seeds on the PVA
nanofibrous mat surfaces grew to Au NPs in situ.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
the proposed process for fabricating composites
of PVA nanofibrous mats with Au NPs grown in situ from Au seeds.

Figure 2a presents
images of water-stable PVA nanofibrous mats (I), PVA nanofibrous mats
with adsorbed Au seeds (II), and PVA nanofibrous mats with Au NPs
grown in situ (III) colored (red) by the composite catalyst, with
the corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs listed
in Figure 2b–d,
respectively. The mean diameter of the PVA nanofibrous mats was 180
± 50 nm (I, Figure 2b), and after adsorbing Au seeds it reached 200 ± 50 nm (II, Figure 2c). This is presumably
because of the assembly of CTAB molecules on the PVA nanofibrous mat
surfaces. With the PVA nanofibrous mats with Au seeds growing to NPs
in situ, the mean diameter increased to 250 ± 50 nm (III, Figure 2d). We also note
from Figure 2d that
the Au NPs are uniformly distributed on the surfaces of the PVA nanofibrous
mats with uniform size. The mean size of Au NPs was estimated to be
30 ± 2 nm, and a good size uniformity was observed on both the
outermost and inner surfaces of the PVA nanofibrous mats, indicating
that the Au seed adsorption step can alleviate the steric hindrance
effect.

All the scale bars represent 1 μm.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the in situ grown PVA/Au
NP nanofibrous mats shown in Figure S1 of Supporting Information presents that besides the peak at 19.4° observed
for PVA nanofibrous mats, there are two other peaks located at 26.4
and 37.9°, indexed to CTAB and the (111) planes of fcc Au, respectively.
The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy of the
in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats in Figure S2 of Supporting Information displays a very prominent
characteristic absorption peak at 540 nm, assigned to the localized
surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs. The sharp peak indicates a narrow
size distribution of Au NPs.

The thermal stability of PVA and
other composite PVA/Au nanofibrous
mats is examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
thermal analysis (DTA) in a N2 atmosphere as shown in Figure
S3 of Supporting Information The DTA results
show that the maximum decomposition temperatures Tmax1 and Tmax2 for the PVA
nanofibrous mats are 332 ± 3 and 441 ± 3 °C, respectively,
close to the previous results of 250–350 and 400–480
°C, which correspond to the thermal decomposition of the side
and main chains of PVA, respectively.42,43 For the PVA/Au
seed nanofibrous mats and in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats,
their Tmax1 increases to 366 ± 3
°C, about 34 °C greater than that of the PVA nanofibrous
mats, while Tmax2 increases very little,
443 ± 3 °C. This remarkable increase of Tmax1 suggests the enhancement of the thermal stability
of the side chains of PVA. Obviously, there exists a strong interaction
among PVA and CTAB because of the assembly of the CTAB layer on the
PVA nanofibrous mat surfaces, which impedes the elimination and oxidization
of the side hydroxyl groups of PVA, and thus suppresses the thermal
degradation process significantly. For the standard adsorbing PVA/Au
NP nanofibrous mat, its Tmax1 reduces
to 318 °C. This is because first, the side hydroxyl groups of
PVA are activated in weak acid solution during the adsorption of Au
NPs. Second, CTAB molecules are cleaned up in the preparation of Au
NPs; as a result, no free CTAB molecules can be adsorbed on the surface
of PVA nanofibrous mats. The loading of Au NPs of the in situ grown
PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats is estimated to be 11 wt % from the TGA
data, much higher than that of the PVA/Au seed nanofibrous mats (3.2
wt %) and standard adsorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats (3.9 wt %).

This high thermal stability and large Au loading of the in situ
grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats can be ascribed to the hydrogen bonds
formed between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the ammonium groups
of CTAB (Figure 1).
The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra in Figure S4 of Supporting Information display an obvious red
shift in the peak characteristic of O–H stretching vibrations
from 3334 cm–1 for PVA nanofibrous mats to 3315
cm–1 for the PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats. It suggests
that there exists a strong interaction associated with a large number
of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the ammonium
groups of CTAB as shown in Figure 1 because the O–H stretching vibration peak is
sensitive to the hydrogen bond. This is favorable for immobilizing
the Au NPs on the PVA/CTAB composite nanofibrous mats, and thus facilitating
the stability of the PVA/Au NP composite nanofibrous mats.

The
potential catalytic applications of the composite PVA/Au NP
nanofibrous mats were evaluated by conducting a series of catalytic
experiments involving a reduction reaction transforming 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol. The reaction was monitored using in situ UV–vis
spectroscopy, and the intensity of the optical absorbance peak at
400 nm was employed to estimate the concentration of 4-nitrophenol
in the aqueous solution. In order to give the control experiment of
the size effect, the size of Au NPs of standard adsorbed PVA/Au NP
nanofibrous mats was similar to that of the in situ grown PVA/Au NP
nanofibrous mats. Figure 3a–d presents the UV–vis spectra over time of
the PVA nanofibrous mats, PVA/Au seed nanofibrous mats, standard adsorbed
PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats, and in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats as catalysts. Figure 3a indicates that the characteristic optical absorbance peak
intensity of 4-nitrophenol undergoes no significant change over a
30 min period when employing the PVA nanofibrous mats as catalysts,
that is, PVA nanofibrous mats cannot catalyze the reaction. As shown
in Figure 3b–d,
the characteristic absorption peak intensities of 4-nitrophenol significantly
decreases with increasing reaction time when employing the PVA/Au
seed nanofibrous mats, standard adsorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats,
and in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats as catalysts. Observably,
the color of the reaction solution faded from yellow to transparent.
The reaction kinetics are presented in terms of the ratio of the concentration
of 4-nitrophenol with respect to time (Ct) to its initial concentration (C0) as a function of time (Figure 3e). The results indicate that there is a
linear relationship between ln(Ct/C0) and reaction time, consistent
with the pseudo-first-order kinetics of the reaction. A linear fitting
presents that the slopes of ln(Ct/C0) are −0.00042, −0.056,
−0.063, and −0.13 for the catalytic reactions by the
PVA nanofibrous mats, PVA/Au seed nanofibrous mats, standard adsorbed
PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats, and in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats, respectively. The slope stands for the reaction rate constant
of catalytic reactions, k. It can be seen from Figure 3f that the in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats has the highest catalytic reaction activity, about two times
larger than those of the PVA/Au seed nanofibrous mats and the standard
adsorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats.

characteristic absorption

reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with various catalysts:
(a) PVA nanofibrous mats; (b) PVA/Au seed nanofibrous mats; (c) standard
absorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats; (d) in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats; (e) kinetics of the catalytic reactions; and (f) reaction rate
constants, k, for the catalytic reactions.

The long-term stability and reusability of the proposed PVA/Au
NP nanofibrous mat catalyst were investigated using multiple cycles
of the 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol reduction reaction. After each
catalytic reaction, the catalysts were stored in deionized ultrafiltered
(DIUF) water for 2 days (d) with no subsequent treatment, and then
the process was repeated. Figure 4a–c presents the plots of ln(Ct/C0) as
a function of time of the catalytic reactions for the PVA/Au seed
nanofibrous mats for 1–5 cycles over a 10 d period, the standard
absorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats for 1–5 cycles over a 10
d period, and the in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats for 1–15
cycles over a 30 d period, respectively, with the corresponding reaction
rate constants k shown in Figure 4d–f, respectively. The k value decreases continuously from 0.056 to 0.003 for the PVA/Au
seed nanofibrous mat catalyst, while for the standard adsorbed PVA/Au
NP nanofibrous mats keeps at a fairly uniform level up to the third
cycle and then decreases substantially from 0.06 to 0.022. After 5
cycles, the k value is reduced by 95% for the PVA/Au
seed nanofibrous mats and 65% for the standard adsorbed PVA/Au NP
nanofibrous mats, respectively. For the in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats, however, the k value decreases from 0.13 to
0.088 over 15 cycles in the 30 d retention period (Figure 4f), just 32% reducing. Moreover,
the smallest value of 0.088 is still greater than the initial one
of 0.063 for the standard absorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats. Obviously,
the in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats provide better long-term
catalytic stability and reusability.

Next, we analyze the mechanism behind the high catalytic activity
and the long-term stability of the in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats. It is well known that the catalytic activity of Au NPs is primarily
dependent on the total surface area, which facilitates efficient contact
between the Au NPs and the substrate molecules. As shown in Figure 2d, the in situ grown
Au NPs have a greater total surface area than Au seeds because of
much larger size, and they are uniformly distributed on both the outermost
and inner surfaces of the PVA nanofibrous mats. It is unlike the standard
adsorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats in which Au NPs are only observed
on the outermost surface of the PVA nanofibrous mats (Figure 4e) because of the steric hindrance
effect. Estimated from the SEM data (Figures 2d and 4e), the particle
number of in situ grown Au NPs on fiber is about 267/μm2, while that of standard adsorbed Au NPs is about 36/μm2. We assume that the particle number of Au seeds on fiber
(PVA/Au seed nanofibrous mats) is the same as that of the in situ
grown Au NPs. Therefore, considering their sizes of 3 nm for Au seed,
33 nm for the adsorbed Au NPs, and 30 nm for the in situ grown Au
NPs, the surface area ratio of the three samples is 1:16.3:100. Clearly,
a large surface area can indeed increase the catalytic performance.
However, the catalytic performance is not directly proportional to
the surface area because the size of NPs also affects it. For long-term
catalytic stability, the CTAB molecules as the protecting agent are
retained as a double-layer on the Au NPs like a cell membrane.44,45 In the standard adsorbing process, the Au seeds and the Au NPs are
typically adsorbed on the PVA nanofibrous mat surfaces via hydrogen
bonds between the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the ammonium groups of
CTAB. These hydrogen bonds are formed randomly and greatly influenced
by the topological morphology of PVA nanofibrous mats. However, during
the in situ growing process, Au atoms in situ grow on Au seeds along
the PVA nanofibrous mats connected by the double-layer of CTAB (see Figure 1). A larger amount
of hydrogen bonds is formed at the interface of Au NPs and PVA nanofibrous
mats. Thus, ultrastable Au NPs are immobilized on PVA nanofibrous
mats. In a word, the proposed in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats provide excellent long-term catalytic stability and reusability.

Conclusions
We have developed an in situ growth approach to fabricate composite
PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mat catalysts by immobilizing Au NPs on the
surface of PVA. Au NPs uniformly distribute on both the outermost
and inner surfaces of PVA nanofibrous mats with a uniform size of
30 ± 2 nm and a high loading of 11 wt %. Compared to that of
the naked PVA nanofibrous mats, the thermal stability of the side
chains of PVA of in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats was remarkably
enhanced, reflected by an increase of 34 °C of the decomposed
temperature. It implies a strong interaction between PVA and Au NPs
stabilized by CTAB, induced by a large number of hydrogen bonds between
the hydroxyl groups of PVA and the ammonium groups of CTAB. Catalytic
experiments demonstrate that the in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous
mats have much higher catalytic reaction activity, about two times
larger than that of the standard adsorbed PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats,
and display consistently high catalytic activity for at least 15 cycles
over a 30 d period. Obviously, introducing numerous hydrogen bonds
is favorable for immobilizing the Au NPs on PVA; as a result, the
composite in situ grown PVA/Au NP nanofibrous mats achieve the long-term
stability and reusability in catalysis. Our work provides a simple
fabrication approach for stabilizing other metal NPs on polymer fibers
to facilitate a wide variety of applications in catalysis, nano-optics
devices, and sensing.

Experimental Section
Materials
PVA
(88% hydrolyzed, Mw = 89–98 kg/mol),
sodium borohydride (NaBH4), ascorbic acid, and CTAB were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Chloroauric
acid (HAuCl4·3H2O), GA (50% water solution),
and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36% water solution) were purchased from
J & K Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China).

Preparation of Water-Stable
PVA Nanofibrous Mats
PVA
was added into DIUF water at 80 °C followed by continuous stirring
to dissolve PVA powder. The polymer concentrations of the solution
were 14 wt %. 0.4 mL GA was added into 2 mL PVA solution and shaked
into a uniform solution. The polymer/GA solutions were placed in a
5 mL syringe and electrospun using a high voltage dc power supply
set to 23 kV, a 15 cm tip-to-substrate distance, and a 0.6 mL/h flow
rate for 45 min. The PVA nanofibrous mats were deposited onto aluminum
foil. These polymer nanofibers were then placed in an oven at 135
°C for 4 h to crosslink the PVA fibers.

Preparation of Au Seeds
The Au seed particles were
prepared using a 7.75 mL aqueous growth solution containing 0.1 M
CTAB and 3.23 × 10–4 M HAuCl4. To
this growth solution, 600 μL of an ice-cold 0.01 M NaBH4 was added.41 The resulting solution
was stirred for 2 min and allowed to sit for 1 h before use.

Adsorption
of Au Seeds on PVA Nanofibrous Mats
The
above Au seeds solution was diluted by a factor of 4 using DIUF water
and 0.5 mL of the diluted seeds solution was added to a 4 mL centrifugal
tube. Next, added HCl solution to adjust the ph value of the diluted
seed solution to 3, and then a piece of 2 cm × 2 cm water-stable
PVA nanofibrous mat was placed in the diluted seeds solution for 4
h at 40 °C. Finally, the polymer nanofibrous mats were washed
with DIUF water three times and stored in DIUF water in a centrifugal
tube.

In Situ Growth of Au NPs on PVA Nanofibrous Mats
For
the in situ growing of Au NPs on PVA nanofibrous mats, growth solutions
were prepared that contained 4 mL of DIUF water, 800 μL of 0.2
M CTAB, and 100 μL of 0.02 M HAuCl4. A 600 μL
portion of 0.2 M ascorbic acid was then added to the growth solution
and mixed thoroughly, turning the solution colorless. Next, a piece
of 2 cm × 2 cm water-stable PVA nanofibrous mat with adsorbed
Au seeds was added to the reaction vessel, and the solution was allowed
to sit for 12 h at 40 °C, and then the polymer nanofibrous mats
were washed with DIUF water three times and treated by the above reaction
procedure again. Finally, the PVA nanofibrous mats with in situ growing
Au NPs were stored in DIUF water in a centrifugal tube.

Preparation
of Au NPs
Gold NPs were prepared according
to a modified surfactant-directed seed-mediated approach. For Au NP
synthesis, growth solutions were prepared that contained 4 mL of DIUF
water, 800 μL of 0.1 M CTAB, and 100 μL of 0.01 M HAuCl4. A 600 μL portion of 0.1 M ascorbic acid was then added
to the growth solution and mixed thoroughly, turning the solution
colorless. Next, the above seed solution was diluted by a factor of
10 using DIUF water, and 2.5 μL of the diluted seed solution
was added to the reaction vessel, and the solution was allowed to
sit for 12 h. The samples were washed with DIUF water three times
by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min). The precipitate was redispersed
in DIUF water in a bottle.

Preparation of Standard Adsorbed PVA/Au NP
Nanofibrous Mats
HCl solution was added into the above Au
NP solution to adjust
the pH value of the solution to 3, and then a piece of 2 cm ×
2 cm water-stable PVA nanofibrous mat was placed in the Au NP solution
for 4 h. Finally, the polymer composite nanofibrous mats were washed
with DIUF water three times and stored in DIUF water in a centrifugal
tube.

Catalytic Reduction of 4-Nitrophenol
The catalytic
reduction of 4-nitrophenol was carried out in a quartz dish. 2 mL
ice-cold 0.1 M NaBH4 solution and 0.2 mL 0.02 M 4-nitrophenol
were added into 17.8 mL DIUF water and stirred into a uniform solution.
2 cm × 2 cm PVA nanofibrous mats of Au seeds, in situ grown Au
NPs, and adsorbed Au NPs were added into 2.5 mL of the above solution
in a quartz dish. The catalytic reaction was in situ measured via
an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV2450, SHIMADZU)
with the scanning wavelength ranging from 200 to 600 nm.

Characterization
The morphologies of polymer nanofibrous
mats were observed by a XL-30 field-emission scanning electron microscope
( Japanese, FEI). FTIR spectra were measured on a Nicolet NEXUS-470
infrared spectrophotometer. XRD patterns were measured by a Bruker
D8 ADVANCE diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu Kα radiation.
TGA was performed with a thermal analyzer, PerkinElmer TGA7 (ITK Co.,
Ltd.), at a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 and under nitrogen flow.
