Focus on lithium–oxygen batteries is growing due
to their
various advantages, such as their high theoretical energy densities
and renewable and environmentally friendly characteristics. Nonaqueous
organic electrolytes play a key role in lithium–oxygen batteries,
allowing the conduction of lithium ions and oxygen transfer in the
three phase boundaries (cathode–gas–electrolyte). Herein,
we report the effect of lithium salt concentrations in single-solvent
lithium–oxygen battery systems systematically (using bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(LiTFSI) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)) on their
electrochemical performances. The first discharge capacities and cyclabilities
exhibit favorable correlations with the lithium salt concentration,
of which using 0.4 and 1.5 M LiTFSI show the best discharge capacities
and cyclabilities. The specific capacity of the 0.4 M LiTFSI system
reaches 7000 mAh g–1, about 1.3 times that of the
commonly used 1 M LiTFSI in TEGDME. Cyclic voltammetry with slow scan
speeds further investigates the system stability and reaction mechanism.
The surface morphology after the discharge and interface impedance
after charging, which are examined using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), have significant
effects on the comprehensive performances. Conductivity and viscosity
play mutual roles in the lithium–oxygen battery performance,
while the oxygen solvation has little effect.

1 Introduction
Since Abraham invented
the lithium–oxygen battery in 1996,
it has been studied worldwide.1 Lithium–oxygen
batteries are viewed as the next generation of new energy batteries
for this century because of their ultrahigh theoretical energy densities,
which are nearly equal to those of gasoline; capacity density; and
environmentally friendly characteristics.2−4 However, the
practical application of lithium–oxygen batteries is limited
due to many issues, such as formation of dendritic lithium anodes
with cycling procedure,5−7 the adsorption and storage of the active material
on the positive oxygen electrode,8−10 and electrolyte optimization
and volume utilization. Especially, for the last part, researchers
have put forward a series of electrochemical systems for stable lithium
salt and solvent adaptation, which can be examined by theoretical
models and calculations11−14 and experimental research studies, such as Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,15,16 Raman spectroscopy,17,18 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),19−22 and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM).23,24 About optimizing the electrolytes, this
can be achieved by introducing appropriate organic additives, soluble
reduction catalysts, but all of these strategies are based on complete
improvement of the basic electrolyte mechanism.25−27 Recently, Francesca
et al. explored different bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)
to tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) molar ratios with
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism explaining the Li2O2 product formation. They emphasized the dynamic
influence of oxygen solubility toward a superconcentrated solution;
however, they ignored the influence of anode Li+ ion conductivity
and cathode product surface morphologies.28 García et al. investigated the various LiTFSI in DME and
studied Li+ ion conductance, cathode interface impedance,
and electrolyte decomposition, which have a direct impact on efficiency.
The research supplemented the theoretical calculation method but ignored
the effects of discharge capacity and cathode Li2O2 specific morphologies.29 Zhou
et al. explored the LiTFSA concentrations in glymes and used the optimized
molar ratio of 1:5 in the system, which exhibited excellent cycling
performance, but the basic physical properties of the electrolyte
were not considered clearly, and the given reaction mechanism interpretation
for applied chemistry data was not enough.30 Gittleson et al. discussed the influence of oxygen in lithium–oxygen
batteries in different systems, implying that oxygen influences the
performances systemically.31 Klassen et
al. studied the optimal LiClO4 concentration in carbonate
solvents but only optimized the design for conductivity. LiClO4 in organic solvents exhibits poor cyclability, and its physical
properties are inadequate.32 Zhang et al.
suggested an optimal LiTFSI concentration in propylene carbonate/ethylene
carbonate (PC/EC) of 0.8 M to obtain the maximum discharge capacity,
and they also studied high concentrations of LiTFSI in DME and found
that lithium–oxygen batteries exhibited greater capacities
with 3 M LiTFSI, and the advantage is even more pronounced for cyclability.33,34 However, they did not focus on the influence of high LiTFSI concentrations
on the oxygen cathode. Liu et al. examined the morphology of the cathode
over a wide range of lithium concentrations of LiTFSI in TEGDME.35 They achieved an explanation of cathode Li2O2 images but with incomplete concentrations, and
they only find one peak for Li–O2 batteries. The
charge–discharge reaction mechanisms have been studied with
the products and byproducts being explored extensively.36−38 It has been found that TEGDME has a low DN (the Gutmann donor number
(DN), which is an index of Lewis basicity and important for the equilibrium),
following the Li2O2 surface phase mechanism,
and exhibits a low discharge capacity and good cyclability.39 However, bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(LiTFSI) has been found to be a high-DN salt, and solvation of the
Li+ ions has a significant effect. McCloskey verified that
the TFSI– ion concentrations have little influence
on the performance, particularly for the discharge capacity, as it
did not influence the Li+ solvation process.40 Electrochemical differential mass spectrometry
(DEMS) analysis of the Li2O2 products and decomposition
of the electrolyte suggested that TEGDME is more stable than any other
solvents such as amines and esters.

In our work, we choose a
Ketjenblack 600 (KB carbon) electrode
as it has a high capacity with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), which
is an excellent binder commonly used for best match empirically, and
because of its adaptability to the better electrolytic liquid system
LiTFSI in TEGDME. Therefore, although the whole research system becomes
complicated, the research results are still of high reference value
for the lithium–oxygen battery due to its excellent performance.
We discussed the first discharge capacity with different current densities
and selected the appropriate charge–discharge current density
of 0.2 mA cm–2 to compare the Coulombic efficiency
and cyclabilities. EIS and SEM are used to evaluate the performances
of lithium–oxygen batteries about electron transfer impedance
and product morphology effects. We studied the physical properties,
viscosity, ion conductivity, and oxygen solubility, for different
LiTFSI concentrations in TEGDME. Through measurements of the electrolytes,
we found that the viscosity and lithium ion conductivity are the main
influencing factors, regardless of the oxygen solubility. To study
that the viscosity increase has nearly no effect on the electrochemical
performances, we use cyclic voltammetry with slow scan rates to evaluate
the electrochemical reaction process. Obviously, both system stability
and changes in products Li2O2 morphologies compensate
for the negative effect of viscosity increase with an increase in
LiTFSI concentrations. By comprehensively studying the effect of physicochemical
properties on the battery performances, we provide suggestions on
how to optimize the electrolyte for lithium–oxygen batteries
at low or high concentrations.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Electrolyte Preparation
The lithium
salt LiTFSI and the TEGDME (98% volume concentration) solvent were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Activated molecular sieves (4 Å)
were immersed in the aforementioned solvent for 3 days to remove residual
water before use. The concentrations of the prepared electrolytes
were 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 M.

2.2 Air Cathode Preparation and Cell Assembly
KB carbon and 20 wt % poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) were mixed
(8:2 by weight) in an ethanol-based solution. After stirring thoroughly,
the slurry was coated on nickel foam with a diameter of 12 mm. The
cathode was subsequently dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 80 °C
to remove residual ethanol. After vacuum-drying, the typical carbon
loading was 0.6 ± 0.2 mg cm–2. Li foil (Ø
15 × 0.6 mm2), a Celgard 3500 membrane, waterleaf
paper, and a porous air electrode with different LiTFSI concentrations
of the electrolyte (about 50 μL) were used to assemble the cells.
All of the batteries were assembled in an Ar atmosphere glovebox (H2O ≤ 1 ppm, O2 ≤ 1 ppm) utilizing
Swagelok batteries with an air window of 78.5 mm2.

2.3 Measurements
The viscosity, ionic
conductivity, and the oxygen solubility of the electrolytes were measured
using a viscometer (DV2TLVT), conductivity meter (S230-USP/EP), and
dissolved oxygen probe (10 FT Cable/EA) at 25 °C, respectively.
Before measuring the oxygen solubility, the system was oxygenated
for 10 min to ensure oxygen saturation.

The cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curves were obtained galvanostatically using Metrohm Autolab
B.V. (Utrecht, the Netherlands). The scan rates were 0.1, 0.15, and
0.2 mV s–1 from an open-circuit potential (about
3.0 V) to 2.0 V, after which the batteries were charged to 4.4 V and
returned to the open-circuit potential. The charge–discharge
profile measurements of the Li–O2 batteries were
obtained galvanostatically using a LAND BT2000 battery test system
(Wuhan Land Electronic Co. Ltd., China). The first discharge capacities
were obtained such that the discharge voltages were limited to 2.0
V, and the charge step ended when the charge voltage increased to
4.4 V with constant current densities of 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mA
cm–2 with different concentrations of LiTFSI in
TEGDME. To investigate the rate capabilities of the cells, charge–discharge
steps were carried out similarly to those in the first discharge capacity
tests. The cyclabilities were measured when discharge capacities were
limited to 500 mAh g–1, and the charge step ended
when the charge voltage increased to 4.4 V at the specific current
density of 0.2 mA cm–2 with different concentrations
of electrolytes. Moreover, we examined the full battery performance
at 0.2 mA cm–2 to explain the results thoroughly.
EIS measurements using lithium–oxygen batteries were performed
to measure the interfacial resistances in the frequency range of 100
kHz to 1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. All electrochemical tests were
performed in gloveboxes filled with oxygen.

Field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S4800)
was applied to observe the morphologies of the electrode surfaces.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Physical Properties of Different LiTFSI Concentrations
in TEGDME
Physical characterization with different concentrations
of electrolytes was performed first (Figures 1 and 2). As shown
in Figure 1, the conductivities
of the electrolytes containing different concentrations of LiTFSI
in TEGDME went through a maximum and subsequently decreased as the
Li concentration increased, and the peak value appeared at 1.0 M (about
2.72 mS).

Figure 1 Ionic conductivity with LiTFSI concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.5,
1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 M in the TEGDME electrolyte.

Figure 2 Viscosity and DO % for LiTFSI concentrations of 0.2, 0.4,
0.5,
1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 M in the TEGDME electrolyte.

As shown in Figure 2, the viscosity exhibited no obvious change below 1
M LiTFSI. The
electrolyte viscosity slightly increased between 1 and 2 M. Above
2 M, a remarkable increase in the electrolyte viscosity was observed,
which was ascribed to the cluster formation of Li ions with TEGDME
molecules of the solvent. The dissolved oxygen values for different
concentrations of electrolyte showed two regions. Below 0.5 M, the
dissolved oxygen content was approximately about 90%, while it was
approximately 100% for 0.5 M and higher concentrations. The properties
influence the battery performances distinctly. First, a high Li ionic
conductivity guarantees lithium ion transport through the entire battery
(usually above 1 mS cm–1). That is, both small bounds
besides 1 M have good Li+ ion conductivity. As the LiTFSI
concentrations increase, the viscosity affects a lot, whereas the
oxygen solubility has little effect. Obviously, the rapid increase
of viscosity caused by high LiTFSI concentration slows down the absorption
and desorption of lithium, which may contribute to the loss of capacity.
Moreover, the oxygen solubility value increased slightly with LiTFSI
concentrations caused by F atom in TFSI–.

3.2 Reaction Mechanism
As shown in Figure 3a, we utilized the
minimum scan rate to ensure that the oxygen was dissolved in the TEGDME.
The lithium–oxygen batteries were discharged to 2.0 V and charged
to 4.4 V for the charge–discharge process. At extremely slow
scan rates, we determined the reaction mechanism. Evidently, at a
0.1 mV s–1 scan rate, the 4 and 5 M LiTFSI systems
exhibited a significantly larger cathode area, which indicates that
there was apparent irreversibility. This could be attributed to the
instability of the system and decomposition of the electrolytes. For
0.2 or 3 M LiTFSI, the anode peaks moved and were wider than those
at other concentrations, corresponding to the slow rate reduction
reaction. In this reaction, oxygen was first reduced with Li+ ions to Li2O and then to Li2O2.
The defects formed during the slow reaction may be attributed to Li2O2 nucleation hysteresis from the dissolved Li2O, which itself requires a high voltage to decompose, resulting
in positive hole plugging and bad cyclability. As for other LiTFSI
concentrations, the reduction peaks were relatively consistent at
nearly 2.45 V (corresponding to reduction of O2 to Li2O2), but the number of oxidation peaks increased
from one (at nearly 3.5 V corresponding to oxidation of Li2O2) to two (at nearly 3.5 and 4.0 V corresponding to oxidation
of Li2O2 and Li2O, respectively)
with the increase in the LiTFSI concentration. This also indicates
that the two oxygen evolution reactions separate while increasing
the LiTFSI concentration. This occurs because of the increased Li+ concentration, causing Li2O to form more easily.
At this slow scan rate, we observed oxidation peak separation.

voltammetry (CV) at a 0.1 mV s–1 scan rate for LiTFSI
concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
3, 4, and 5 M. First CV curves for 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mV s–1 scan rates with (b) 0.4 M LiTFSI, (c) 0.5 M LiTFSI, (d) 1.5 M LiTFSI,
and (e) 3 M LiTFSI in TEGDME.

To investigate the influence of the LiTFSI concentrations
on the
Li–oxygen battery reaction mechanism in TEGDME, we performed
CV at low scan rates (0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mV s–1)
using 0.4, 0.5, 1.5, and 3 M LiTFSI. The reaction mechanism was very
complex, as shown in Figure 3b–e. However, we confirmed that the anode peak potential
value shifted toward a relatively stable lithium–oxygen battery
system, and this shift was in the negative direction. This means that
there were adequate oxygen and Li+ in the whole system.
The cyclic voltammetry behaviors were valuable for practical lithium–oxygen
battery systems because the charge–discharge current densities
for the present lithium–oxygen batteries were smaller than
those of traditional lithium ion battery systems. At 0.4 and 1.5 M
LiTFSI, the peak position offset is relatively small with the increasing
scan speed. However, by the same amplitude scan rate increased, whether
at 0.5 and 3 M, the shift in the peak position is uncertain or even
reversed. Obviously, the system state is relatively stable at 0.4
and 1.5 M LiTFSI. This is just a reference for the stability of our
battery system; however, the specific peaks are more complex and not
discussed in detail.

3.3 First Discharge Capacity
The first
discharge capacities were measured from the open-circuit voltage discharge
to 2.0 V and then to 4.4 V. As shown in Figure 4b–j, at the same current density (illustrated
for 0.05 mA cm–2), the order of first specific discharge
capacities from highest to lowest was 0.4 M LiTFSI (nearly 7000 mAh
g–1), 1.5 M (nearly 6500 mAh g–1), the lower concentrations (about 5700 mAh g–1), and the higher concentrations (exhibited attenuation trends from
2 to 5 M, beginning at nearly 6000 mAh g–1 and decreasing
to 5000 mAh g–1 in 5 M LiTFSI). Moreover, the specific
discharge capacity variation tendency was nearly consistent at other
current densities. Thus, at the same LiTFSI concentration, the discharge
capacity decreases gradually with increasing discharge–charge
current density. Furthermore, the first specific discharge capacity
decreased with the increase in the discharge–charge current
density, which was more evident between 0.2 and 0.5 mA cm–2 at different charge–discharge current densities. The comparison
is shown in Figure 4a.

3 M, (i) 4 M, and (j) 5 M) in TEGDME at charge–discharge current
densities of 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mA cm–2.

3.4 Rate Ability
As shown in Figure 5, the different constant
charge–discharge current densities resulted in evident differences
at different LiTFSI concentrations. At the lowest current density
of 0.05 mA cm–2, the efficiency could be distinguished
between the 2 M LiTFSI (nearly 100%) and the higher concentrations.
As the current density slightly increased, to 0.2 mA cm–2, the efficiency toward the lower concentrations was subdivided successfully
below 1 M LiTFSI and between 1 and 2 M. This may be ascribed to the
higher current density accelerating the differentiation for interface
transport impedance, which can be seen in Figure 5. However, at a higher current density of
0.5 mA cm–2, the behavior changed significantly.
The lower concentrations exhibited distinct decreases than other concentrations,
and even at the ultrahigh current densities achieved at 4 and 5 M,
the efficiency was greater than that at lower current densities. At
the lower concentrations, the formation of spherical discharge products
may easily block the holes of the cathode during the fast discharge
step, preventing the complete decomposition process. However, at higher
concentrations, amorphous membrane products formed that could be easily
decomposed.

Figure 5 Coulombic efficiency with different concentrations of LiTFSI in
TEGDME at different constant discharge–charge current densities
from the open-circuit voltage to 2.0 V, followed by charging to the
terminal voltage of 4.4 V.

3.5 Cyclability
Figure 6 shows the cyclability for different concentrations
of LiTFSI in TEGDME with a fixed discharge capacity of 500 mAh g–1 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm–2. The terminal voltage for 0.4 and 1.5 M concentrations of LiTFSI
(of nearly 2.7 V) exhibited better performances than that for other
concentrations (about 28 cycles to reach a terminal discharge voltage
of 2.0 V). Besides these two concentrations, the performance at 0.4
M was slightly better than that at 1.5 M, which was evident after
10 cycles. The performances at below 0.4 M concentrations of LiTFSI
were better than those at higher concentrations. The results are consistent
with the interface transfer impedance and the discharge product morphologies
of the cathodes. Also, we consider that in ultrahigh concentration
solutions the molar ratio of the organic solvent and Li+ is nearly the same, and this reduces the Li+ Lewis acidity,
forming a big cation complex Li(TEGDME)n+. The complex can reduce the fast LiO2 disproportion that
reduces the cycling performance. However, LiTFSI at a slightly higher
concentration can effectively combine with TEGDME to prevent solvent
decomposition and improve the cycling performance. As a result, double
peaks exhibit good cycle performance in a Li/LiTFSI–TEGDME/KB-PTFE
battery system.

versus
cycle numbers for different concentrations of LiTFSI in TEGDME.

3.6 SEM and EIS for Full Batteries
As
shown in Figure 7,
there were different forms of the discharge products. As shown in Figure 7a, the pristine air
cathode (KB electrode) exhibited connected small spherical particles.
The holes were evenly distributed. When discharged first to 2 V at
a current density of 0.2 mA cm–2, the product particle
morphologies are evident. At lower concentrations, Li2O2 attached to the surface of the KB carbon. The particles grew
significantly and covered the spherical KB, which is evident in Figure 7b,c. However, at
a concentration of 1.5 M or higher, membrane-like products not only
covered the surfaces of the KB particles but also distributed in the
holes, spreading over the entire cathode, which is evident in Figure 7d–f. The products
with higher concentrations were amorphous Li2O2, which generally decompose easily during charge processes. Moreover,
we tested the morphology for the sample charged first to 4.4 V. The
Li2O2 products decomposed for the 0.4 M LiTFSI,
and the particle sizes were nearly the same as those of the pristine
sample. This indicated that there was good OER performance, which
led to optimum cyclability. At a 0.5 M LiTFSI concentration, the spherical
products were larger than those at 0.4 M, the sizes of the morphological
features were bigger, and Li2O2 was not fully
decomposed. However, at higher concentrations, the membrane-like amorphous
Li2O2, which spread across the whole cathode,
were more easily decomposed at 1.5 M than at 3 M. Compared with the
spherical morphologies, the membrane-like products were amorphous
and decomposed nearly completely, leaving small particles similar
to those of the pristine sample. Thus, the spherical products formed
easily at lower concentrations, but partial overwrapping resulted
in decomposition difficulties. The membrane-like products easily decomposed
but clogged the pores. As a result, 0.4 and 1.5 M LiTFSI contributed
to good performance in terms of the discharge capacity and cyclability.

images of the KB carbon cathode before discharge. (b–e)

and 3 M and at a constant current density of 0.2 mA cm–2. (f–i) Charged first cathodes at the concentrations of 0.4,
0.5, 1.5, and 3 M and at a constant current density of 0.2 mA cm–2.

As shown in Figure 8, EIS spectra changed at different states. The interface
transfer
impedance of the pristine sample decreased between the lowest concentration
0.2 M and 1 M (∼80 Ω), after which it rapidly increased
to 1.5 M (∼140 Ω) and subsequently decreased (∼80
Ω) between 2 and 4 M. Finally, it increased rapidly again to
5 M (∼225 Ω). The results can be explained by the comprehensive
physical properties, ionic conductivity, viscosity, and oxygen solubility.
The open-circuit voltage interface impedance was not the dominant
factor of the lithium–oxygen battery performances. The interface
transfer impedance results showed that the best LiTFSI concentration
was 0.4 M, which decreased effectively after the discharge than at
the open-circuit voltage, while after 1 charge cycle, the impedance
nearly did not change. This also indicates that the Li2O2 discharge products were better decomposed at 0.4 M
LiTFSI in TEGDME. A similar phenomenon can be seen for 1.5 and 0.5
M LiTFSI, which also decreased the interface impedance, but not for
a concentration of 0.4 M. However, the lowest and highest concentrations
were different. After the discharge step, the interface transfer impedance
did not significantly change, and after the charge step, the impedance
increased considerably, which contributed to the poor cycle performance.

V, and charged to 4.4 V with 0.2 mA cm–2 current
densities and 0.4, 0.5, 1.5, and 3 M concentrations.

4 Conclusions
In our study, we explored
that different LiTFSI concentrations
with the TEGDME solvent result in different discharge capacities,
rate abilities, and cyclabilities. Furthermore, we explained the electrochemical
system stability with CV at low scan rates for lithium–oxygen
batteries with different LiTFSI concentrations (from 0.2 to 5 M) briefly.
Moreover, the 4 and 5 M LiTFSI systems were the most unstable. The
0.2 and 3 M systems exhibited slow oxygen reduction steps, which contributed
to difficulty in decomposition of the Li2O2 and
Li2O discharge products. As for other LiTFSI concentrations,
which exhibited fast oxygen reduction steps, the oxidation peak gradually
separated with the increase in LiTFSI concentration, which exhibited
better oxygen reduction and product oxidation processes with different
product oxidation procedures. Thus, we increased the scan rate slightly
to investigate this further. With increasing scan rate, only 0.4 and
1.5 M LiTFSI concentrations systems show a slight right shift at the
peak position of the cyclic voltammetry, which corresponds to a relatively
stable system. The specific electrochemical performances are measured.
The 0.4 and 1.5 M LiTFSI systems exhibited better first specific discharge capacities and cyclabilities,
which were ascribed to the cathode morphology and interface transfer
impedance. The rate abilities at various concentrations were different,
but there was no obvious trend as the current density increased. The
physical properties of the electrolytes are important, especially
the Li+ ion conductivity, viscosity, and oxygen solubility.
The Li+ ion conductivity and viscosity influence the lithium–oxygen
battery performances significantly, while the oxygen solubility had
little effect. Above all, we focus on acquiring higher primary capacity
and better cycle performance, whether little is known about the efficiency
problems caused by some byproducts, such as LiOH, Li2CO3 and the TFSI– decomposition, which could
be an additional detailed part to be considered. The surface of lithium
anode with different LiTFSI concentration electrolytes has been studied
deeply and has an important influence, so we did not discuss this
in detail in this article.
