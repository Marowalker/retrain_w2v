Properties of gas molecules (NO,
NH3, and NO2) adsorbed on two-dimensional GaN
with a tetragonal structure (T-GaN)
are studied using first-principles methods. Adsorption energy, adsorption
distance, Hirshfeld charge, electronic properties, electric conductivity,
and recovery time are calculated. It is found that these three molecules
are all chemisorbed on the T-GaN with reasonable adsorption energies
and apparent charge transfer. The electronic properties of the T-GaN
present dramatic changes after the adsorption of NO2 and
NO molecules, especially its electric conductivity, but NH3 molecule hardly changes the electronic properties of the T-GaN.
Furthermore, the recovery time of the T-GaN sensor at T = 300 K is estimated to be quite short for NO2 and NO
but very long for NH3. Moreover, the magnetic properties
of the T-GaN are changed obviously due to the adsorption of NO (or
NO2) molecule. Therefore, we suggest that the T-GaN can
be a prominent candidate for application as NO2 and NO
molecule sensors.

1 Introduction
Gas sensing devices are
becoming increasingly mandatory for homeland
security, medical and environmental monitoring, space exploration,
automotive applications, and chemical process control. To meet these
demands, the sensing properties (mainly including sensitivity, selectivity,
stability, and speed) of gas sensors should be greatly improved, and
these have awakened an enormous interest in the development and selection
of optimal sensing materials.1−5 Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have taken the front row in innovative
applications of gas sensors in the recent years,6−12 particularly after the successful experimental synthesis of graphene.13 This is because the advantages of using nanomaterials
with small size and dimension for gas sensing stem from the large
surface-to-volume ratio, high specific surface area, and more surface
active site. These favor the adsorption of gases on the sensor and
can increase the sensitivity of the device because the interaction
between the analytes and the sensing part is higher.

Group-III
nitride gas sensing devices have been explored theoretically
and experimentally for many years,14−34 and the sensing materials based on group-III nitride are mainly
concentrated on thin films (or nanosheets),14−20 one-dimensional nanotubes21−25 and nanowires,26−28 and nanoclusters (or nanoparticles).29−34 Gallium nitride (GaN), as one archetype of group-III nitride, has
been envisioned as one of the most promising materials for next-generation
technology. In particular, 2D GaN has been theoretically predicted35−41 and experimentally realized.42−44 It was reported that the 2D GaN
nanomaterials have shown high thermal stability, large band gap (that
means low electrical conductance), and high surface-to-volume ratio,35−44 indicating that 2D GaN have great advantage in the applications
of gas sensors. Therefore, it is very interesting and important to
study the feasibility of using 2D GaN as gas sensors.

Hennig
group has predicted the structural and electronic properties
of 2D GaN materials and found that 2D GaN materials with a tetragonal
structure (named as T-GaN) are more energetically favorable over other
2D GaN structures.37 Furthermore, they
have theoretically identified suitable substrates for the growth of
2D GaN materials.38,39 Each Ga and N atom of the T-GaN,
much different from the 3-fold coordinated planar or buckled hexagonal
structure, is bonded to four neighboring N and Ga atoms, respectively.
Recently, new methods such as the migration-enhanced encapsulated
growth method43,44 have been used for the synthesis
of 2D GaN nanosheets. These new approaches may be applied to generate
the T-GaN nanostructure. Polluting nitrogen components, such as NO,
NO2, and NH3, are the byproduct of various chemical
and biological processes and considered to be hazardous. Therefore,
in this work, we employ first-principles calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) to accurately describe the adsorption behavior
and electronic properties of the NO, NO2, and NH3 gases on the T-GaN, to explore the feasibility of using the T-GaN
as molecule sensors.

2 Calculation Methods and Model
All of our DFT calculations are carried out using the DMol3 program package implemented in Materials Studio.45,46 The exchange and correlation effects of the electrons are described
by using the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation of
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)47 functional with van der Waals correction proposed by Tkatchenko
and Scheffler method.48 The standard DNP
basis sets and density-functional semicore pseudopotentials49 fitted to all-electron relativistic DFT results
are selected to describe the electron–ion interaction. The
self-consistent field calculations are done with a convergence criterion
of 10–6 au on the energy and electron density. We
optimize the geometric parameters without symmetry constraints, meanwhile
we set convergence criterions of 10–3 au on the
gradient and displacement and 10–5 au on the total
energy in geometrical optimization. We use a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell
under the periodic boundary condition on the x and y axes to model the infinite T-GaN. The Brillouin zone is
sampled by 10 × 10 × 1 special k-points
for using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme.50 To prevent interactions between the adjacent supercells, a minimum
of 20 Å vacuum space is kept.

To evaluate the stability
of molecule adsorption on the T-GaN,
the adsorption energy (Eads) is defined
as Eads = E(gas–GaN) – E(GaN) – E(gas), where E(gas–GaN), E(GaN), and E(gas) represent the total energy with full relaxation for the
gas molecule adsorbed on the T-GaN, the corresponding pristine T-GaN,
and single gas molecule, respectively. With this definition, positive
adsorption energy indicates that the adsorption is endothermic whereas
the opposite indicates the exothermic process. The charge transfer
between T-GaN and absorbed molecules is analyzed on the basis of Hirshfeld
analysis.51 The reliability and accuracy
of our methods used here for investigating the structures and electronic
properties of GaN systems with gases adsorption have been confirmed
by previous studies.26,32,52−54

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structure of the Pure T-GaN
First,
we discuss the structural geometries of the pure T-GaN, and the optimized
stable structure is shown in Figure 1a,b. In the T-GaN, alternating atoms are located in
different planes. There are two different types of Ga–N bonds,
one is located along a1 direction, whose
bond length is 2.046 Å, whereas the other is located along a2 direction, whose bond length is 1.906 Å.
The Braviais lattice vectors of the T-GaN are given with , which
is 3.745 Å. The buckling displacement
(i.e., the distance between two planes) is about 0.71 Å. These
results are consistent with those reported in previous studies.37Figure 1c,d shows the band structure and density of states (DOS’s)
of the pure T-GaN, respectively. The pure T-GaN is predicted to be
a semiconductor with a wide band gap, which is 1.883 eV. It is well
known that the DFT-GGA method used here obviously underestimates the
absolute band gaps of semiconductors; thus, the real band gap of the
T-GaN should be larger than that of our theoretical result. The band
gap predicted by HSE06 hybrid functional should be closer to that
of the experimental data.37 However, as
discussed below, what we focused on is mainly concerned on the change
of band gaps. For different methods, the change of band gaps seems
to be similar. From the analysis of density of states, it can be found
that the valence bands near Fermi level are mainly dominated by the
3p atomic orbitals of Ga atoms and the 2p atomic orbitals of N atoms
and the contribution of the other atomic orbitals to the valence bands
is very small.

3.2 Adsorption of NO2, NH3, and NO on the T-GaN
Second, we investigate the adsorption
behavior and electronic properties of molecules on the T-GaN. To obtain
the most stable configurations of each molecule adsorption on the
T-GaN, we have considered as many as possible initial structures for
each molecule adsorbed on the T-GaN. Specifically, all possible starting
adsorption sites have been considered, namely, tops (including the
Ga and N atom in upper and lower layers, respectively), hollow, and
bridge (including Ga–N bonds in upper and lower layers and
the junction between the upper and lower layers) sites. Meanwhile,
for these positions, different molecular orientations were examined.
For example, for NO molecule, we considered three possible orientations.
The molecule axis was oriented parallel or perpendicular (with the
O atom pointing up or down) with respect to the T-GaN. Each initial
structure was fully relaxed. The most stable adsorption configurations
of each molecular gas on the T-GaN are presented in Figure 2, and the corresponding results
are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

NO2; (d) NH3; (e, f) NO. We only show the structure
around the adsorbed molecule. Isomeric structures for each molecule
adsorbed on the T-GaN are labeled as 1, 2, and 3 in order of decreasing
stability. Values in parentheses are relative energies in electron
volts with respect to the most stable one for each species. Red and
white balls are O and H atoms, respectively.

a The distance between the N atom
in NO and Ga atom is 1.890 Å, whereas the distance between the
O atom in NO and the N atom in T-GaN is 1.374 Å.

Then, we discuss the adsorption
of NO2 molecule on the
T-GaN. For the most stable configuration of NO2 on the
T-GaN, as shown in Figure 2a, there is only one O atom bonded with a Ga atom and the
Ga–O bond length is 2.066 Å, which is consistent with
that of Ga–O chemical bonds in Ga2O3 crystal,55 indicating the NO2 molecule is chemisorbed
on the T-GaN. The chemisorption feature is further inferred from the
adsorption energy, which is −0.673 eV. This is similar to the
case of NO2 adsorbed on the GaN nanotubes,25 nanowires,26 and clusters.32 A charge transfer of 0.108e from the NO2 molecule to the T-GaN is found when one
O atom is bonded with the T-GaN. For the pure NO2 molecule,
the N–O bond length is 1.209 Å and the angle of O–N–O
is 133.5°. After the adsorption, for the NO2 molecule,
the distance between the N atom and the O atom bonded with the Ga
atom is 1.274 Å and the other N–O bond length is 1.215
Å. The angle of O–N–O reduces to 122.1°. These results indicate
that the NO2 molecule has an obvious deformation because
of the adsorption, especially for the N–O bond, which is close
to the Ga–O bond. We also obtained other lowest-energy structures
of NO2 molecule on the T-GaN. For the second stable one,
as shown in Figure 2b, it is found that the N atom in NO2 is bonded with a
Ga atom in T-GaN, with the Ga–N bond length of 2.135 Å.
The adsorption energy of this configuration is −0.644 eV, just
higher by 0.029 eV than that of the most stable one. Meanwhile, we
also found that the N atom in NO2 can bind to a N atom
in T-GaN, forming a N–N bond with the bond length of 1.381
Å. This is the third stable configuration, as shown in Figure 2c. Its adsorption
energy is −0.625 eV, only higher by 0.048 eV than that of the
most stable one. Because of such a small energy difference between
the three configurations of NO2 on T-GaN, it can be suggested
that these adsorption states would occur when lots of NO2 molecules are close to the T-GaN. From Table 1, it can be seen that there are obvious charge
transfers from the NO2 molecule to the T-GaN no matter
what the interaction between NO2 molecule and the T-GaN
is, indicating NO2 has electron-withdrawing capability.

Because the NH3 molecule is more complex than NO2, the number of initial structures of NH3 molecule
on the T-GaN we set up were more than that of NO2 on the
T-GaN. However, after full optimization of these initial structures,
they have been changed into one structure, which is shown in Figure 2d. In the optimized
structure of NH3 molecule on the T-GaN, the N atom of NH3 is bonded with a Ga atom, forming a Ga–N bond, whose
length is 2.089 Å. The H–N distance is 1.023 Å and
the angle of H–N–H is 110.2° for the NH3 after adsorption, which basically agree with those of the isolated
NH3 molecule. It indicates that the adsorption does not
influence the structure of the NH3 molecule. Meanwhile,
the T-GaN also is not influenced by the adsorption, although the adsorption
energy of the NH3 molecule on T-GaN is as large as −1.317
eV. Because of strong adsorption, NH3 molecule servers
as an acceptor and withdraws 0.289e from the T-GaN.

Finally, we identify the structures of NO molecule on the T-GaN.
The former two most stable structures of NO molecule on the T-GaN
are shown in Figure 2e,f. For the most stable one, as shown in Figure 2e, whose adsorption energy is −0.872
eV, the O atom of NO is bonded with a Ga atom, whereas the N atom
of NO is bonded with a N atom of the T-GaN, forming a Ga–O
bond and a N–N bond, respectively. The Ga–O and N–N
bond distances are 1.890 and 1.374 Å, respectively. Because of
the NO adsorption, the T-GaN has an obvious deformation around the
adsorption site. One Ga–N bond is broken, and the distance
is 2.483 Å, much larger than that of the pure T-GaN. Meanwhile,
the N–O bond length in NO molecule is elongated from 1.164 Å
in the isolated model to 1.357 Å. In the second stable configuration,
as shown in Figure 2f, the N atom in NO binds to a Ga atom, thus forming a Ga–N
bond. The Ga–N bond length is 2.192 Å, similar to that
of Ga–N bonds in other GaN structures.52−54 Similar to
the adsorption of NO2 on the T-GaN, Hirshfeld charge analysis
shows that there are apparent charge transfers from the NO molecule
to the T-GaN, indicating NO molecule plays a role as an electron-withdrawing
functional molecule.

The calculated band structures and density
of states (DOS’s)
of the T-GaN with molecule adsorption are shown in Figures 3–5, respectively. All of the band gaps are
listed in Tables 1 and 2. It is worth noting that although we have calculated
the band structures and DOS of all of the structures, as shown in Figure 2, we just analyze
the band structures and DOS of the most stable configurations for
each molecule adsorbed on the T-GaN. Compared with the band structure
of the pure T-GaN (Figure 1c), the band structures are modified obviously after the adsorption
of NO and NO2 molecules but the band structure, especially
near the Fermi level, is not changed apparently because of the NH3 molecule adsorption. This indicates that the NO and NO2 adsorption greatly changes the electronic properties of the
T-GaN. From Figure 2 and Tables 1 and 2, it can be seen that different orientations of
NO2 (or NO) molecule on the T-GaN result in different configurations
of molecule/T-GaN systems and these configurations have quite different
band structures. This may indicate that the surface polarity and configuration
would play an important role in NO2 and NO gas sensing
of the T-GaN. Furthermore, comparing with the DOS of the pure T-GaN
(Figure 1d), the total
DOS of the molecule–T-GaN systems and the local density of
states (LDOS’s) of the corresponding molecules show that these
molecules modulate the electronic properties of the T-GaN in different
manners: first, the adsorption of NO2 molecule introduces
certain impurity states in the band gap and the Fermi level crosses
these states. Thus, the adsorption of NO2 molecule would
decrease the original band gap. Second, the analysis of LDOS shows
that NH3 molecule adsorption introduces fully occupied
states that are strongly hybridized with the original states of T-GaN
in the valence band and these states are nonlocalized. These results
indicate that the interaction between the NH3 molecule
and the T-GaN is very strong, which is consistent with the analysis
of adsorption energy. The Fermi level is pinned in the top of the
valence band, same as the case of the pure T-GaN, indicating that
the adsorption of NH3 molecule does not change the band
structure near the Fermi level of pure T-GaN. Third, the NO molecule
adsorption induces unoccupied local states in the conduction band
and more importantly, the Fermi level is shifted into original conduction
bands, obviously indicating that the NO molecule adsorption can apparently
enhance the conductance of the T-GaN.

3.3 Possibility
of the T-GaN as a Gas Sensor
Next, we examine that whether
the T-GaN be suitable as a molecular
sensor for NO2, NH3, and NO detection. As mentioned
above, these three molecules are all chemically adsorbed on the T-GaN
with apparent Eads and have obvious charge
transfers that may affect the electrical conductivity of the T-GaN.
In this regard, the T-GaN can be viewed as a molecular sensor for
NO2, NH3, and NO gas detection. However, the
sensitivity of a good sensor should be of concern. The sensitivity
can be evaluated by estimating the electric conductivity change of
the T-GaN before and after adsorption, which relates to the band gaps
(Eg) as follows56  where σ is the electric
conductivity
of the configurations, k is the Boltzmann constant
(k = 8.62 × 10–5 eV/K), and T is the thermodynamic temperature. We found that the change
of band gaps for the most stable structures of NO2 and
NO molecule adsorbed on the T-GaN is 1.645 and 1.803 eV, with respect
to the corresponding pure T-GaN, respectively. Therefore, the NO2 and NO molecules can be detected by calculating the conductivity
change in the T-GaN before and after the adsorption process, in particular
for NO molecule. However, the band gap energies of the T-GaN sheet
are barely influenced by the adsorption of NH3 molecule.
These results are consistent with the analysis of band structures
and DOS, especially for the NO. Although the adsorption of NH3 molecule could hardly affect the electronic properties of
the T-GaN, the adsorption-induced charge transfer between the NH3 molecule and T-GaN, as mentioned above, is expected to affect
the resistivity of the system, which would be measured experimentally
and could be a maker for gas sensors. This should be similar to the
cases of NH3 molecule on monolayer MOS2,57 phosphorene,58 and
Ti2CO2.59 In these
systems, the resistivities increase obviously due to the charge transfer
induced by the adsorption of NH3 molecule, although the
adsorption of NH3 molecule hardly changes the band structures
of the systems. However, as discussed below, it is found that the
T-GaN is still not suitable for NH3 detection because of
the recovery time.

Furthermore, it needs to be noted that the
strong adsorption of a molecule on the T-GaN indicates that desorption
of this molecule from the T-GaN could be quite complicated, that is
to say, it may require a long recovery time. For a good sensor, the
recovery time should be very short to satisfy the demand of sustainable
use. Therefore, we then estimate the recovery time (τ) of the
considered molecules adsorbed on the T-GaN. The recovery time, using
transition state theory, relates to the adsorption energy (Eads) as follows60  where ν0 is the
attempt frequency, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the
temperature. Supposing the NH3 and NO molecules have the
same order of magnitude for the attempt frequency as that of NO2 (ν0 = 1012 s–1),60 the recovery time of the T-GaN sensor
at T = 300 K is estimated to be 0.2 s, 3.6 ×
104 h, and 7.3 min for the adsorption energy of −0.673
eV (NO2), −1.317 eV (NH3), and −0.872
eV (NO), respectively. The recovery time for NH3 is so
long that it precludes the applications of the T-GaN as a reusable
molecular sensor for NH3 gas, further indicating that the
T-GaN is not suitable as a molecular sensor for NH3 detection.

Taking aspects such as adsorption energies, forms of adsorption
(chemically or physically), charge transfer, the change of band structures
and DOS, the change of conductivity, and recovery time into consideration,
the T-GaN should be a promising reusable molecular sensor for highly
sensitive NO2 and NO detection with a short recovery time.
In fact, this perspective can be concluded by using a completely new
transduction principle, which is the exploitation of magnetic instead
of electrical property modifications due to surface–gas interaction
in the active material.61,62 Our results show that
the pure T-GaN is nonmagnetic. The adsorption of NO (or NO2) molecule introduces spin polarization in the T-GaN with a magnetic
moment of approximately 1 μB, indicating that magnetic
properties of the T-GaN are changed obviously due to the adsorption
of NO (or NO2) molecule, which is similar to the cases
of NO (or NO2) on GaN nanowires26 and nanocluster.32 However, the net spin
polarization of the T-GaN is not modified due to the adsorption of
NH3 molecule. In this regard of the change of magnetic
properties, the T-GaN can be viewed as a highly sensitive gas detection
technique based on the measurement of the local magnetic moment in
the T-GaN using various experimental methods such as atomic force
microscopy or superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry.63−65 To further investigate the origin and distribution of the magnetic
moment, we calculated the magnetic moment of each atom in the molecule–T-GaN
systems. The spin density of the most stable configurations of NO2 (or NO) adsorbed on the T-GaN is shown in Figure 6. The magnetic moment is mainly
located at the NO2 (or NO) molecule and the N atom of T-GaN
that is closest to the NO2 (or NO) molecule and chiefly
originates from the 2p states of N and O atoms.

Figure 6 Spin density of the most
stable configurations of (a) NO2 and (b) NO adsorption
on the T-GaN with isovalues of ±0.005
e/Å3.

Finally, it is interesting to compare our results with those
of
previous studies. To the best of our knowledge, there are just a few
experimental and theoretical studies on the investigation of gas sensing
materials based on pure GaN nanostructures to detect NO, NO2, and NH3 gases. Bishop et al. have experimentally demonstrated
that the GaN device, which is processed with 20 nm Pt on the n-type
GaN sample, was not responsive to 15 ppm of either NO2 or
NH3 because the concentration is below the detection limit
of the device.20 Our results show that
the T-GaN can even detect one NO2 molecule. Khan and Srivastava25 have predicted that the GaN nanotube shows high
sensitivity to the adsorption of NO2 and NH3; however, the adsorption energy of NO2 and NH3 is in the range of 1.11–1.41 and 0.95–0.99 eV, respectively,
indicating that the GaN nanotube would have much longer recovery time
than that of the T-GaN. Recently, we have investigated the adsorption
of gas molecules (SO2, NO2, HCN, NH3, H2S, CO, NO, O2, H2, CO2, and H2O) on the graphitic GaN sheet with an atomically
flat planar honeycomb hexagonal structure (PL-GaN) using density functional
theory calculations.66 It is found that
the PL-GaN sheet should be a highly sensitive and selective NH3 sensor with a short recovery time. NO and NO2 molecules
are physically adsorbed on the PL-GaN sheet. These results are very
different from our present work, indicating that the T-GaN and PL-GaN
have entirely different gas sensing properties.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, using density functional theory
calculations, the
adsorption of nitrogen molecules (including NO2, NH3, and NO) on the 2D tetragonal GaN (T-GaN) has been investigated.
It is found that these three molecules are all chemisorbed on the
T-GaN with reasonable adsorption energies and apparent charge transfer.
The electronic properties of the T-GaN sheet present dramatic changes
after the adsorption of NO2 and NO molecules, especially
their electric conductivity, but NH3 molecule hardly changes
the electronic properties of the T-GaN. Meanwhile, the very strong
adsorption of NH3 on the T-GaN makes its desorption difficult,
which precludes its applications to NH3 sensors. Taking
into consideration various aspects, such as the adsorption energies,
charge transfer, the change of the electric conductivity, and the
recovery time, it is concluded that the T-GaN can be viewed as a potential
molecular sensor for NO2 and NO detection. Furthermore,
the net spin polarization of the T-GaN is obviously changed into about
1 μB after the adsorption of the NO (or NO2) molecule, which indicates the T-GaN is a promising candidate for
a highly sensitive magnetic sensor for detection of NO and NO2.
