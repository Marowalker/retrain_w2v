Advancements
in the field of nanotechnology have resulted in the
emergence of a large variety of engineered nanomaterials for innumerable
applications. Despite the ubiquitous use of nanomaterials in daily
life, concerns regarding the potential toxicity and safety of these
materials have also been raised. There is a high demand for assessing
the unwanted effects of both gold and silver nanoparticles, which
is increasingly being used in biomedical applications. This paper
deals with the study of stress due to silver and gold nanoparticles
of varying size on red blood cells (RBCs) using Raman tweezers spectroscopy.
RBCs were incubated with nanoparticles of size in the 10–100
nm range with the same concentrations, and micro-Raman spectra were
recorded by optically trapping the nanoparticle-treated live RBCs.
Spectral modifications implicating hemoglobin deoxygenation were observed
in all nanoparticle-treated RBCs. One of the probable reason for the
deoxygenation trend can be the adhesion of nanoparticles onto the
cell surface causing imbalance in cell functioning. Moreover, the
higher spectral variations observed for silver nanoparticles indicate
that oxidative stress is involved in cell damage. These mechanisms
lead to the modification in the hemoglobin structure because of changes
in the pH of cytoplasm, which can be detected using Raman spectroscopy.

Introduction
Nanoscience and technology
has become one of the leading disciplines
because of unique chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials.
Nanomaterials have gathered high attention owing to their applications
in different arenas of medicine and biology such as bio-imaging, cancer
therapy, drug delivery, biosensors, agriculture, and so forth.1−11 Nanoparticles can enter human body in different ways such as ingestion
or through skin.12,13 The application of nanoparticles
in drug delivery and cosmetics may result in intrusion of nanoparticles
in the human body.14 Once the nanoparticles
enter into the human body, they can interact with tissues, cells,
and biomolecules present in body fluids.15−17 Even though
nanomaterials have been widely used, there is a lack of information
regarding the nanoparticle–cell interactions and its implications
on health. For the nanoparticles to enter the cell, it has to make
its way across the cell membrane. Therefore, one of the key factors
while considering nanoparticle toxicity is their interaction with
the cell membrane18. Interaction
of metal nanoparticles can occur through different mechanisms; it
can enter cells either by active or passive uptake depending on the
cell type.19 Phagocyte cells such as neutrophils,
macrophages, and monocytes engulf the particles.20 Passive transport is adopted by the cells lacking endocytosis
machinery such as red blood cells (RBCs).21

Investigation of cellular responses toward the presence of
these
foreign agents is of paramount importance in recognizing the biological
functioning under stress factors and further cellular regulation.
The size of the nanoparticles plays an important role in determining
their interaction with biological cells.19 Internalization mechanism, uptake efficiency, and subcellular distribution
of nanoparticles depend on properties of nanoparticles including the
size. A size-dependent cell–nanoparticle interaction study
was reported for gold, silver, polystyrene, and iron oxide nanoparticles.19,22−24 Maximum nanoparticle uptake was observed for the
particles with the size range from 30 to 50 nm in the case of active
uptake.19 In the case of passive uptake,
polystyrene nanoparticles below 200 nm were observed to enter the
cell. Also, gold nanoparticles of size 4–5 nm could enter the
RBCs through the passive uptake root.25

Among different nanoparticles, silver and gold nanoparticles
are
well known and are being used in many applications. Zhang et al. suggested
that distribution and toxicity of gold nanoparticles depend on the
size of the nanoparticles based on a study conducted on mice.26 The antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles
is due to silver ions and causes inhibition of culture of bacteria
such as Escherichia coli.27 Even the antibacterial property of silver nanoparticles
was found to be size-dependent28.

In general, the size is not the only factor which decides
the toxicity.
For example, positively charged nanoparticles are more toxic compared
to negative or neutral nanoparticles because the negatively charged
membrane can attract positively charged nanoparticles.29−31 Larger nanoparticles have higher ligand to receptor interactions
compared to small nanoparticles because they require many nanoparticles
to interact with the receptor simultaneously to trigger the membrane
wrapping process.32 In contrast, a single
large nanoparticle can induce uptake by acting as the cross-linking
agent to cluster receptors. Earlier reports on the nanoparticle-induced
toxicity with respect to the size of the nanoparticles are mostly
using transmission electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy,
and so forth. Different toxicity assessments such as necrosis assay,
apoptosis assay, and oxidative stress measurements have been used.19,33−36 In vivo studies include analyzing bio-distribution and clearance,
hematology and serum chemistry, histopathology, and so forth.37 Nanotoxicity of metallic nanoparticles on fish
RBCs has also been reported.38 Winnik and
Maysinger have detailed various mechanisms of quantum dot-induced
cytotoxicity, where cadmium-containing quantum dots are able to exert
genotoxic, epigenetic, and metalloestrogenic effects. It was also
suggested that even minute concentrations of quantum dots may raise
transgenerational effects.39

Raman
spectroscopy is a widely accepted and highly effective spectroscopic
technique, which provides the molecular fingerprints of biological
samples in a wide range of applications.40−43 The flow cell-based Raman spectroscopic
technique was recently reported in order to tackle the probable photodamage
in blood and provides reproducible results from flowed blood lysates
with a high signal to noise ratio.44 The
study has displayed the ability of detecting very small variations
in the hemoglobin oxygenation state because of the aging effect in
blood. However, the extension of conventional Raman spectroscopy for
RBC studies experience limitations because of the Brownian motion
of these micrometer-sized biological cells suspended in liquid media.
Conventional physical and chemical cell immobilization techniques
can vary the cell environment and adversely impact its functioning.
In view of these, the use of optical tweezers which permits live cell
manipulation under physiological conditions is escalating in biomedical
research community. This technique in combination with Raman spectroscopy
can thus enables the users to conduct characterization of live cells
without the need of any chemical fixative agents/external stains.

Increasing concerns of potential toxicity on mankind via the use
of metallic nanoparticles for diverse applications highlight the necessity
of conducting systematic investigations on its detrimental effects.
The use of Raman tweezers for investigating the effects of metallic
nanoparticles on biological cells remains limited, and moreover, the
choice of gold nanoparticles still remains unexplored.45−47 Besides, single-cell Raman characterization in combination with
optical trapping have not yet been explored for evaluating size-dependent
effects of metallic nanoparticles. The current study investigates
the in vitro interaction of both silver and gold nanoparticles of
different sizes with human live RBCs. Here, we utilize optical tweezers
combined with the micro-Raman spectroscopic tool to evaluate the nanoparticle-induced
stress effects on RBCs. RBCs can be treated as a model system to investigate
the passive uptake of nanoparticles because RBCs lack endocytosis
machinery and different organelles such as nucleus, mitochondria,
and so forth. Raman tweezers spectroscopy enables investigation of
cell–nanoparticle interaction at the single cell level. Raman
spectra were acquired from trapped RBCs post incubation with the nanoparticles.
Close investigations of the spectral variations show that nanoparticles
can alter intracellular hemoglobin oxygen binding ability to RBCs
regardless of their size. The present work demonstrates the capability
of Raman tweezers spectroscopy technique for monitoring interactions
of live human RBCs with exogenous stress agents.

Materials and Methods
Experimental
Setup
Raman tweezers setup with the 785
nm laser (Starbright Diode Laser, Torsana Laser Tech, Denmark) was
used for spectral measurements (Figure 1). Both trapping and Raman spectroscopy were carried
out using the same laser. The beam expander was used for increasing
the beam diameter (nearly 8 mm) so as to overfill the back aperture
of the microscope aperture, after which the beam was directed into
an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse, Ti-U, Japan). A dichroic mirror
was used to reflect the 785 nm into a 100× oil immersion microscope
objective (MO). The beam was focused into the single cell for trapping.
Backscattered light from the trapped particle or cell was directed
into the spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon iHR320 with 1200 grooves/mm
grating blazed at 750 nm) via the same MO. Raman signal detection
was enabled via liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD (Symphony CCD-1024x256-OPEN-1LS).
Polystyrene beads were used for calibrating the sample. For visualizing
the sample, a camera was fixed at one of the exit ports of the microscope.
A detailed explanation for the instrumentation of the setup can be
referred elsewhere.45 Baseline correction
of the recorded spectra was performed by means of the asymmetric least
squares smoothing method.48,49 The vector normalization
method was used for normalizing the spectra.49,50

Sample Preparation
Ethical clearance was obtained from
Manipal Institutional Ethics Committee, Kasturba Hospital, to draw
blood from healthy volunteers (IEC 294/2013). Informed consent was
obtained from the volunteers prior experiments. Blood cells were separated
by centrifuging whole blood at 3000 rpm for 5 min. RBCs were taken
in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution in order to obtain a
dilute suspension of the live erythrocytes and used for further studies.
Both Au and Ag nanoparticles of sizes 10, 30, 50, 80, and 100 nm (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used for the present study on RBC–nanoparticle interactions.
The characterization was performed on selected nanoparticles to confirm
the specifications provided (Supporting Information I—Figure S1) by SigmaAldrich. RBCs were diluted
in PBS solution (25 μL in 2 mL) and then treated with 50 μL
(0.015 mg) of nanoparticles and incubated in CO2 using
an incubator. For the concentration-dependent study, nanoparticles
were incubated with varying concentrations such as 25 μL (0.0075
mg), 50 μL (0.015 mg), and 100 μL (0.03 mg) of both Au
and Ag nanoparticles. Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed
after 24 and 48 h of incubation. Control spectra, that is, RBCs incubated
without nanoparticles, were also recorded.

Results and Discussion
Initially RBCs were treated with varying concentrations of both
50 nm silver and gold nanoparticles in order to examine the concentration-dependent
stress effects on RBC. All the spectra were recorded in the region
510–1700 cm–1 with a laser power of ∼10
mW and 4 minutes of acquisition time. We have already carried out
experiments to study the laser-induced variation in the Raman spectrum
of RBCs for different laser powers in the previous literature. With
the current experimental setup used, 10 mW laser power was found to
be the safe limit.50Figure 2A shows average Raman spectra of RBCs treated
with silver and gold nanoparticles of 50 nm size. Each spectrum is
an average of 10 spectra obtained from different RBCs, and only the
spectra of RBCs treated with 50 μL (0.015 mg) for 48 h are shown
in Figure 2A. Variations
were observed for the peaks at 565, 753, 1000, 1375, 1398, 1545, 1619,
and 1635 cm–1. The spectral variations obtained
for certain bands (565, 1211, 1224, 1375, and 1635 cm–1) after nanoparticle incubation (48 h) in a dose-dependent manner
are plotted in Figure 2B. Raman band assignments for the peaks showing changes are listed
in Table 1. The decrease
in the RBC oxyhemoglobin status with a higher nanoparticle concentration
is evident from the ratio of deoxy/oxy marker bands (1224–1211
cm–1) plotted in Figure 2B. An increase in 1211 cm–1 accompanied by a decline in 1224 cm–1 is observed
in the presence of nanoparticles, which indicates the modification
of oxygenated hemoglobin to the deoxygenated state inside the cell.
These peaks attributed to methine C–H deformation in heme are
considered as the crucial marker bands for evaluation of the hemoglobin
oxygenation status inside RBCs.51 These
peaks are highly sensitive to any conformational modifications occurring
in RBC hemoglobin. The oxy–deoxy transition is also evident
from the decrease in oxygenation marker 1635 cm–1. As expected, Raman spectral variations were maximum for a higher
concentration of nanoparticles, and a linear relationship was also
obtained between the nanoparticle concentration and intensity of few
Raman bands. Also, very little spectral changes were observed after
24 h of incubation. RBCs treated with 100 μL of silver nanoparticles
were ruptured after 48 h of incubation. Hence, the Raman spectroscopy
study could not be conducted. Further experiments were performed with
50 μL of nanoparticles.

Effect of Silver Nanoparticles
of Different Sizes on RBCs
Experiments to evaluate the AgNP
size-dependent stress impact on
RBCs were carried out using silver nanoparticles of average sizes
in the range of 10–100 nm. Figure 3 shows the average spectra of control RBCs
and RBCs treated with silver nanoparticles. The shaded region shows
the standard deviation from the mean. Each spectrum is the average
of 25 Raman spectra from different RBCs recorded after 48 h of incubation
in nanoparticles. As evident from Figure 3, variations in the intensity of Raman bands
at 565, 753, 1224, 1375, 1398, and 1635 cm–1 were
observed. The intensity decline observed in both the Fe–O2 stretch at 565 cm–1 and the oxygen concentration
marker band at 1635 cm–1 clearly indicates the adverse
effects of nanoparticles on hemoglobin oxygen ligation. Besides, deoxygenated
hemoglobin formation is also validated from the intensity enhancement
of peaks present at 1211 and 1545 cm–1. Comparison
of the major spectral variations is shown in Figure 4A1–A4. Figure 4B represents the mean intensity value of
particular peaks obtained for different sizes of silver nanoparticles
compared to control RBCs. Each value represents mean value ±
standard deviation for 25 Raman spectra recorded from different RBCs.
Raman spectral changes at 565, 1635, 1211, and 1224 cm–1 were more prominent in 30 nm silver nanoparticle-treated RBCs, whereas
RBCs treated with 50, 80, and 100 nm nanoparticles displayed a maximum
variation for the pyrrole band present at 1375 cm–1.

Effect of Gold Nanoparticles of Different
Sizes on RBCs
The experiment was also repeated with gold
nanoparticles of sizes
10, 30, 50, 80, and 100 nm. The average spectra of control RBCs and
RBCs treated with different gold nanoparticles are shown in Figure 5. Each Raman spectrum
is an average of 25 spectra from different RBCs recorded after 48
h of incubation. The peaks displaying notable changes are shown in Figure 6A1–A4. Hemoglobin
oxygenation marker bands present at 565, 1211, 1375, 1398, and 1635
cm–1 showed an intensity variation upon nanoparticle
treatment. The mean value obtained for the abovementioned bands in
the spectra for nanoparticles of different sizes is given in Figure 6B, in order to clearly
distinguish the spectral variations. Maximum intensity changes were
observed in the Raman spectra of RBCs treated with 30 nm, whereas
10 nm nanoparticle-treated RBCs have shown minimum spectral variations.

time and 10 mW laser power.

and RBCs treated with gold nanoparticles.

Comparison of Stress Effects due To Silver and Gold Nanoparticles
A comparative analysis of the size-dependent effect of silver and
gold nanoparticles of different sizes on RBCs has been performed.
The mean value of Raman peaks at 565, 1375, and 1635 cm–1 obtained for the control and both AgNP- and AuNP-treated RBCs is
shown in Figure 7A.
Because the peaks at 753 and 1545 cm–1 were showing
negligible variations, they were excluded in this plot. Also shown
in the figure is the ratio of 1224–1211 cm–1 because an increase in the intensity of 1211 cm–1 is observed with a concomitant decrease in the intensity of the
peak at 1224 cm–1. Silver nanoparticle-treated RBCs
showed more prominent changes except for the 1375 cm–1 peak. The concentration of the nanoparticles was kept constant at
50 μL (0.015 mg/mL) in the case of all the abovementioned experiments.
Silver nanoparticle-treated RBCs displayed higher spectral variations
compared to gold nanoparticle-treated RBCs. Besides, the spectral
variations were dominant in ∼30 nm size nanoparticles. It is
evident from the figure that silver nanoparticles can be more harmful
than gold in influencing the hemoglobin oxygen binding affinity of
RBCs.

of RBCs recorded after treating with silver and gold nanoparticles

There are different explanations
for cell–nanoparticle interactions
and possible toxicity on the cells. Cell–nanoparticle interactions
can be primarily assessed through two different scenarios. One of
the probable mechanisms is the adhesion of the nanoparticle on the
cell membrane.47 The RBC membrane has a
lipid bilayer which has proteins and glycoproteins embedded in it.
These sialic acid-rich glycoproteins are negatively charged and are
responsible for the electronegativity of the RBC membrane.56 This nature of the RBC membrane makes them electrostatically
attract positively charged nanoparticles. The positively charged or
neutral nanoparticles tend to be adsorbed on the cell membrane.57 The cell membrane is responsible for many functions
including exchange of gas molecules such as O2 and CO2 and small molecules such as urea and water.58 Passive transport facilitates exchange of ions and polar
molecules via integral membrane proteins. Obstruction in these channels
due to nanoparticle adherence may lead to impairment of cell membrane
properties, pH imbalances, and so forth.47 Blockade in the Na+/H+ channels which is responsible
for removing H+ and maintaining pH inside the cells can
result in the decrease in the pH of the RBC cytoplasm (known as the
Bohr effect).59 This can finally affect
the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin and hence results in the
conversion of hemoglobin from the oxygenated state to the deoxygenated
state.47 The adverse trends observed in
the case of nanoparticle-treated cells points out that the mechanism
involved in RBC damage may be due to the adherence of nanoparticles
on the cell membrane.

The probability of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production which
can harm cells by lipid peroxidation cannot be ruled out in the case
of cell–nanoparticle interactions.60 This mechanism can induce damage on proteins and other biomolecules.61,62 Thiol values are measured in order to verify the possibility of
oxidative stress in the presence of nanoparticles. Notable changes
observed in thiol values (Supporting Information III—Figure S2) point out the oxidative stress generation
in the case of RBCs treated with nanoparticles. Higher Raman spectral
variations observed in AgNP-treated RBCs as compared to gold-treated
RBCs can be thus linked to its reduced thiol content. The reduced
thiol content observed in the case of silver nanoparticles indicates
the higher oxidative stress induced by them on RBCs. Oxidative stress
can stimulate Ca2+ pump of the plasma membrane and trigger
Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels. This can lead to
hyperpolarization of the RBC membrane and causes Cl– loss. In this case, the cell tries to maintain the ratio [Cl]o/[Cl]i in order to equalize the [H+]i/[H+]o ratio. Thus, the cell becomes
progressively acidified and obviously results in the conversion of
oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin. On the whole, both the above-mentioned
mechanisms can pave way for the oxy–deoxy transition of hemoglobin
in RBCs. The RBC membrane structure depicted in Figure 8a–c shows the above proposed mechanisms
involved in nanoparticle-induced stress effects on RBCs.

Figure 8 (a) Schematic
diagram depicting the RBC membrane structure. (b)
Positively charged nanoparticles can get attracted to the negatively
charged cell membrane. (c) Mechanism of metal nanoparticle toxicity
on erythrocytes (because of nanoparticle adhesion on cell membrane
and oxidative stress triggering K+ channels).

Raman experiments were also performed to verify the heating
effect
on RBCs in the presence of laser nanoparticle interaction. A series
of three spectra were recorded continuously from three sets of samples—control
RBCs, RBCs with AgNP, and RBCs with AuNP. The heating effect on RBCs
was evaluated by monitoring the peak intensities of 663 and 1245 cm–1 vibrational frequencies which is regarded as heme-aggregation
markers. As evident from the Supporting Information Figure S3, much difference in spectra was not observed for
nanoparticle-treated cells as compared to control cells. Also, the
wavelength of the probe laser does not coincide with the absorption
wavelength of the treated nanoparticles (Supporting Information I—Figure S1). From these results, it can be concluded
that the entire spectral changes in the presence of nanoparticles
are not associated with the heat effect. This will also substantiate
the above described two mechanisms: (a) nanoparticle adherence on
the cell membrane and (b) oxidative stress generation in silver and
gold nanoparticle-treated RBCs. Particularly in the case of erythrocytes
which lack endocytosis mechanism, the nanoparticle stress effects
is because of membrane–nanoparticle interaction or ROS. Because
of ROS, the silver nanoparticles can induce maximum perturbation in
blood cells. Thus, the Raman tweezers study of silver and gold nanoparticles
of different sizes and their interaction with RBCs show higher stress
effects for the larger nanoparticles studied here.

Conclusions
Nanoparticle-induced stress on RBCs has been studied using the
Raman tweezers spectroscopy technique for different sizes of gold
and silver nanoparticles. RBC–nanoparticle interaction has
altogether adversely influenced the oxygen binding ability of hemoglobin,
which is evident from the enhancement in deoxygenated hemoglobin markers
accompanied with a reduction in the oxyhemoglobin markers. Apart from
this, the silver nanoparticles have a comparatively higher adverse
effect on RBCs than gold nanoparticles. The oxidative stress induced
by silver nanoparticles prompts greater changes in the cell and hence
higher spectral variations. As the nanoparticle interaction with RBCs
leads to changes in the hemoglobin structures which can be traced
by Raman spectroscopy, the technique can be used for assessing adverse
effects induced by metallic nanoparticles. Our study corroborates
the two mechanisms involved in metal nanoparticle-induced hemoglobin
deoxygenation on RBCs—adherence of nanoparticles on the RBC
membrane and oxidative stress generation. Any information regarding
various sized nanoparticle-induced stress effects on blood components
is crucial and valuable in the selection of nanoparticles of specific
size in biomedical applications. This study also raises the possibility
of health issues during the exposure of metallic nanoparticles to
the human system.
