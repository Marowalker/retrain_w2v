Carbohydrate–protein
interactions play key roles in a wide
variety of biological processes. These interactions are usually weak,
with dissociation constants in the low millimolar to high micromolar
range. Nature uses multivalency to reach high avidities via the glycoside
cluster effect. Capitalizing on this effect, numerous synthetic multivalent
glycoconjugates have been described and used as ligands for carbohydrate-binding
proteins. However, valency is only one of the several parameters governing
the binding mechanisms that are different for every biological receptor,
making it almost impossible to predict. In this context, ligand optimization
requires the screening of a large number of structures with different
valencies, rigidities/flexibilities, and architectures. In this article,
we describe a screening platform based on a glycodendrimer array and
its use to determine the key parameters for high-affinity ligands
of lectin. Several glycoclusters and glycodendrimers displaying varying
numbers of α-N-acetylgalactosamine residues
were covalently attached on glass slides, and their bindings were
studied with the fluorophore-functionalized Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) used as a lectin model. This technique requires
minimal quantities of glycoconjugate compared to those for other techniques
and affords useful information on the binding strength. Building of
the glycodendrimer array and quantification of the interactions with
HPA are described.

==== Body
Introduction
Multivalent glycoarchitectures
have progressively emerged as relevant
molecular systems for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.1−3 Strong interaction with carbohydrate-binding proteins (i.e., lectins
and antibodies) by means of the glycoside cluster effect4−6 is the prerequisite to the development of efficient tools, such
as diagnostic probes, antiadhesives, and antitumoral therapeutics
or drug-delivery systems. However, despite major progresses in the
deciphering of binding mechanisms, the design of high-affinity ligands
remains almost impossible to predict because each biological receptor
specifically responds to multivalent ligands according to its own
structural parameters.7,8 For this reason, the development
of active ligands often requires time-consuming synthesis of libraries
of structures with diverse geometries and valencies and in a sufficient
quantity (∼10 mg) to allow reliable biological investigations.

Microarray technology has clearly demonstrated its efficacy to
probe interactions between carbohydrates and biological targets9−17 (i.e., proteins, pathogens, or cells) because the microarray format
requires lower quantities of both ligand and protein than those required
for standard experiments such as isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type assays,18,19 is easy to set up, and is reusable.20 If covalent immobilization of carbohydrates on surfaces allows multivalent
presentation, the resulting two-dimensional disposition only partially
reflects their natural display, which strongly limits the access of
reliable information to design potent multivalent ligands. In addition,
even though surface density can be tuned easily, intermolecular chelation
of lectins with monovalent ligands may occur, thus leading to an uninterpretable
surface cluster effect. More recently, glycocluster-based microarrays
have been developed to both overcome these limitations and improve
sensitivity of detection. The controlled presentation of sugars in
a well-defined three-dimensional arrangement and at low surface density
indeed gives access to the direct analysis and binding properties
of the immobilized compound. For example, Pieters et al. have immobilized
1- to 8-valent structures covalently onto porous aluminum oxide chips
to monitor multivalency effects in real time with fluorescent lectins.21 In another study, the same group has drawn binding
profiles for a series of lectins, which has highlighted both specific
recognition and distinct binding patterns.22 The groups of Morvan and Chevolot have used the noncovalent DNA-directed
immobilization method for immobilizing glycocluster–DNA conjugates
on DNA microarrays by double-helix formation.23,24 Fluorescence endpoint detection was used to screen these ligands
toward lectins. After studying the impact of the cluster density,
they have been able to identify nanomolar inhibitors for the lectin
LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.25 All of these studies clearly demonstrated that
the spatial arrangement of multivalent structures on surfaces favors
stronger interactions with lectins than with monovalent ligands. However,
these experiments allowed discrimination of ligands with significant
differences in valency, thus leading to predictable data in the majority
of cases. On the contrary, systematic evaluation of ligands with close
structural features in terms of rigidity/flexibility, size, and valency
that are key parameters to identify potent inhibitors has only rarely
been described so far.26 In this study,
we report the immobilization and screening of a series of N-acetyl-α-d-galactosamine-functionalized
(αGalNAc) tetra- and hexadecavalent glycodendrimers on microarray
slides. Using this screening platform, different binding assays were
performed, to quantify their affinity toward the αGalNAc-specific Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) lectin. HPA is a hexameric
lectin produced by a roman snail. This lectin displays two trimers
constituted of monomers linked by disulfide bridges. This β-sandwich
fold leads to two domains distant of 100 Å, each displaying three
carbohydrate recognition domains located between two adjacent monomer
strands, with 20 Å distance between two neighboring binding sites.27

Results and Discussion
In a preliminary
report, our group has shown that covalent immobilization
of glycoclusters on glass slides using both direct and indirect oxime
ligation strategies affords surfaces displaying well-defined structures
capable of interacting selectively with fluorescent lectins.28 In particular, we have reported that a tetravalent
αGalNAc-cluster showed promising but moderate interaction with
HPA. To improve its recognition potency, several elements have to
be tuned in the structure. We first decided to increase the valency
to 16 copies onto scaffolds with variable flexibilities and shapes.
Alternate combination of cyclopeptides and/or polylysine dendrons
was indeed proved to be successful to identify nanomolar inhibitors
of the bacterial lectin LecB from P. aeruginosa.29 Similar structures have thus been
synthesized following a strategy based on copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition (CuAAC).30,31

Synthesis of Multivalent
Glycoconjugates
First, tetravalent
glycoclusters 2 and 4 were prepared by CuAAC
conjugation of propargyl 2-deoxy-2-acetamido-α-d-galactopyranoside32 on azido-functionalized cyclodecapeptide 1 and polylysine dendron 3 (Scheme 1).30 Monofunctionalized compound 5 was also prepared, as
a monomeric reference, and clusters 6 and 7 displaying hydroxymethyl and α-mannoside residues, respectively,
were chosen to serve as negative controls in the binding studies.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Tetravalent Glycoclusters
Reagents
and conditions: (i)
propargyl 2-deoxy-2-acetamido-α-d-galactopyranoside,
CuSO4·5H2O, tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine
(THPTA), sodium ascorbate, dimethylformamide (DMF)/phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (1:3, pH 7.5), room temperature (rt), 1 h. All amino
acids have the L-configuration.

Next, hexadecavalent
compounds were built in a convergent manner.
Clusters 2 and 4 were further functionalized
on their remaining free lysine residue with an N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS)-activated pentynoic acid linker33 to afford intermediates 8 and 9. A second
CuAAC ligation with scaffolds 1 and 2 yielded
glycodendrimers 10–13 displaying
16 copies of αGalNAc (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Hexadecavalent Glycodendrimers
Reagents and conditions: (i)
2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl pent-4-ynoate, diisopropylethylamine, DMF,
rt, 30 min. (ii) 1 or 2, CuSO4·5H2O, THPTA, sodium ascorbate, DMF/PBS (1:3, pH
7.5), rt, 1 h.

Glycoarray Fabrication
To ensure a reproducible and
controlled display of the multivalent glycoconjugates, covalent immobilization
was chosen, exploiting the free amino group on their lysine side chain
and NHS-activated glass slides to obtain an amide linkage. Compounds
were spotted in triplicate using a piezoelectric microspotter at various
concentrations in buffered solutions (PBS 1× with 5% glycerol).
The volume of each drop was monitored by spotter software to obtain
final spots with a controlled diameter of 200 μm. The experiments
have been performed while monitoring the humidity to prevent evaporation.
With this platform in hand, qualitative binding assays as well as Kd and IC50 determination could be
performed (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Glycoconjugate Immobilization and Binding and Competition Assays
Binding Assays
To facilitate the binding assays, the
functionalized glass slide was inserted into a rigid mask with silicon
separators, creating 16 isolated wells and allowing us to evaluate
14 different experimental conditions in parallel. Lectin solutions
(PBS 1× pH 7.5 with 0.1% BSA) ranging from 7.5 μM to 0.15
nM were poured in the mask wells and incubated for 1 h. After washing
with PBS and drying with argon, the slide was scanned and the fluorescence
intensities were quantified using a fluorescent scanner (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Fluorescence intensity
evaluation for the interaction of multivalent
glycoconjugates with HPA: (A) rainbow picture displaying fluorescence
intensity (HPA: 1.9 nM, λex = 635 nm); (B) comparison
of the maximum of fluorescence (HPA: 7.5 nM; immobilization concentration
of ligand: 40 μM); and (C) comparison of the maximum of fluorescence
normalized per monosaccharide unit (HPA: 7.5 nM; immobilization concentration
of ligand: 40 μM).

First, the absence of signal for tetravalent compounds 6 and 7, functionalized with hydroxymethyl and
α-mannoside,
respectively, confirms that nonspecific interactions either with the
surface or with a sugar other than αGalNAc are not observed.
This assay also showed a significant difference between glycoclusters 2 and 4, suggesting that the interaction with
the latter, based on the lysine dendron, is much stronger. The data
obtained for hexadecavalent glycodendrimers also show a more favorable
binding when this lysine dendron is used whether as the central (higher
intensities for 11 and 13 compared to those
for 10 and 12, respectively) or peripheral
(higher intensities for 12 and 13 compared
to those for 10 and 11, respectively) scaffold.
Finally, on correcting the intensity values with regard to the compounds’
valencies (Figure 1C), compound 13 shows the highest relative potency per
sugar residue over other hexadecavalent structures. It should also
be mentioned that when glycoclusters are diluted with compounds devoid
of GalNAc instead of free buffer, no difference of interaction is
observed. This result is in good agreement with previous observations
and suggests that glycoclusters are immobilized in a homogenous manner
on the surface.34

Measurement of Kd Values
The strength of the interaction
and the influence of relative surface
densities of glycoconjugates were assessed in the measurement of dissociation
constants (Kd) values.24,35,36 To this end, compounds were spotted at eight
different concentrations, ranging from 0.3 nM to 40 μM. Binding
isotherms were obtained for each set of concentrations by increasing
the concentration of lectin, and Kd values
were obtained by linear regression (Figure 2).37 To have a
progressive isotherm reaching a maximum plateau region, lectin has
to be introduced in excess relative to the glycocluster. In the case
of the monovalent compound 5 and the tetravalent compounds 2 and 4, this plateau could not be reached and
therefore Kd’s could only be precisely
calculated for hexadecavalent molecules 10–13.

Figure 2 Determination of dissociation constants: (A) binding curves for
the tetra- and hexadecavalent glycoconjugates (immobilization concentration:
10 μM); (B) comparison of the dissociation constants for the
hexadecavalent structures (mean of the Kd determined for a range of immobilization concentration of 40–0.3
μM; see the Supporting Information).

The dissociation constant is a
thermodynamic parameter that should
not be dependent on the experimental conditions (as opposed to IC50). However, some authors have reported that above a given
surface density a receptor can interact with epitopes from two neighboring
glycoconjugates, leading to a surface cluster effect and a decrease
of Kd.38,39 In our case,
this phenomenon was observed at spotting concentrations above 10 μM
(see the Supporting Information). Therefore,
only Kd’s calculated at lower concentrations
were considered.

The values obtained confirmed what was observed
in the qualitative
binding assays. Compound 13 composed of two layers of
lysine dendron showed the best affinity with a Kd of 12 nM. Compounds 11 and 12 alternating
the two scaffolds gave very similar results with Kd values of 24 and 21 nM, respectively. However, compound 10 seemed to be a weaker ligand with a Kd of 98 nM. Although these four compounds have the same valency,
a significant difference of affinity of almost 1 order of magnitude
could be evidenced with our assay.

Measurement of IC50 Values
To determine
IC50 values, assays were performed using GalNAc as a competitor.
Glycoconjugates were immobilized at 10 μM to avoid the surface
cluster effect that could affect the outcome of the experiment. Solutions
of HPA (7.5 nM) and GalNAc at various concentrations, from 50 mM to
1 μM, were preincubated for 1 h. These solutions were then incubated
for 1 h in the slide’s wells functionalized with glycodendrimers.
The resulting IC50 values (Figure 3) are the concentrations in the competitor
required to inhibit half of the HPA–glycoconjugate interaction.
At this immobilization concentration (10 μM), IC50 values could only be obtained for the hexadecavalent compounds and
tetravalent molecule 4. When comparing the affinities
of hexavalent dendrimers, the same relative potencies were observed
as with Kd measurements. Compound 10 with an IC50 of 180 μM showed the weakest
binding as opposed to compound 13 (IC50 =
687 μM). Once again molecules 11 and 12 showed no significant difference with intermediate values of 449
and 301 μM, respectively.

with GalNAc incubated
with HPA at 7.5 nM (immobilization concentration: 10 μM): (A)
inhibition curves; (B) IC50 values determined for the competitor.

Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay
(ELLA)
To confirm the reliability
of the screening method, enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLA) have been
performed (Figure 4). In contrast to the IC50 values evaluated by the microarray,
in the ELLA experiment, the half-inhibition concentration was determined
for the glycodendrimers with an αGalNAc-functionalized polymer
used as the immobilized reference ligand. The lowest value was determined
for compound 13 with an IC50 of 7 nM and the
highest one for 10 with 61 nM that corresponds to a difference
of approximately 1 order of magnitude. Compounds 11 and 12 display similar IC50 values with, respectively,
18 and 11 nM. These results are in excellent agreement with the trend
previously observed by microarray evaluations.

inhibition curves; (B) IC50 values
determined for the hexadecavalent conjugates.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrate that glycodendrimer
arrays allow
rapid screening of multivalent glycostructures toward lectin. By grafting
multivalent architectures in a controlled, covalent manner on a glass
slide, we have evaluated the binding of αGalNAc-ligands with
the lectin HPA both qualitatively, with a simple binding assay, and
quantitatively, allowing for Kd and IC50 values. All of the collected data have shown consistent
results, thus confirming the reliability of this method (Table 1). Compared with other
techniques such as ITC, surface plasmon resonance, or ELLA inhibition
assays, the microarray format requires very low quantities of ligands,
is versatile and easy to handle, and can be used to screen a large
library of ligands in parallel. In addition, this approach offers
the advantage to allow interaction studies with no risk of aggregation
that often occurs with multivalent compounds. Together with the previous
“indirect method” that allows us to synthesize glycostructures
on surfaces using successive conjugation steps,28 we expect to develop an expedient method to assemble glycodendrimers
on surfaces with a larger quantity and diversity of platforms and
sugar units. The resulting arrays would represent ideal tools to discover
high-affinity ligands for relevant bacterial lectins or antibodies
for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

Experimental Section
General
Methods
All chemical reagents were purchased
from Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) or Acros (Noisy-Le-Grand,
France) and were used without further purification. All protected
amino acids and Fmoc-Gly-Sasrin resin were obtained from Advanced
ChemTech Europe (Brussels, Belgium), BachemBiochimie SARL (Voisins-Les-Bretonneux,
France) and France Biochem S.A. (Meudon, France). For peptides and
glycopeptides, analytical reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) was performed on a Waters alliance 2695 separation module,
equipped with a Waters 2489 UV/visible detector. Analyses were carried
out at 1.23 mL/min (Interchim UPTISPHERE X-SERIE, C18,
5 μm, 125 × 3.0 mm2) with UV monitoring at 214
and 250 nm using a linear A–B gradient (buffer A: 0.09% CF3CO2H in water; buffer B: 0.09% CF3CO2H in 90% acetonitrile). Preparative HPLC was performed on
Waters equipment consisting of a Waters 600 controller and a Waters
2487 Dual Absorbance Detector. Purifications were carried out at 22.0
mL/min (VP 250 × 21 mm2 nucleosil 100-7 C18) with UV monitoring at 214 and 250 nm using a linear A–B
gradient. Progress of reactions was monitored by thin layer chromatography
using silica gel 60 F254-precoated plates (Merck). Spots were visualized
by charring with 10% H2SO4 in EtOH. Silica gel
60 (0.063–0.2 mm or 70–230 mesh, Merck) was used for
column chromatography. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a BrukerAvance III 500 MHz spectrometer, and chemical
shifts (δ) were reported in parts per million (ppm). Spectra
were referenced to the residual proton solvent peaks relative to the
signal of D2O (4.79 ppm for 1H). ESI mass spectra
of peptides and glycopeptides were measured on an Esquire 3000 spectrometer
from Bruker or on an Acquity UPLC/MS system from Waters equipped with
a SQ2 detector. high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses were performed
on a Waters Xevo G2-S QTof at mass spectrometry facility, PCN-ICMG,
Grenoble.

General Procedures
General Procedure A for Copper-Catalyzed
Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition
(CuAAC)
A solution of CuSO4·5H2O (0.1 equiv per alkyne), THPTA (0.2 equiv per alkyne), and sodium
ascorbate (1 equiv per alkyne) in PBS buffer (400 μL, pH 7.5)
was added to a solution of azidated scaffold (1 equiv) and propargyl
2-deoxy-2-acetamido-α-d-galactopyranoside (6 equiv)
or propargylated glycocluster (4.4 equiv) in 400 μL of a 1:1
mixture of DMF/PBS buffer (pH 7.5). The mixture was degassed under
argon and stirred at room temperature for 1 h, after which ultra performance
liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis showed complete coupling. Chelex
resin was added to the reaction mixture that was stirred for an additional
30 min and purified by semipreparative RP-HPLC (5–40% solvent
B in 15 min) to afford the desired compound as a white fluffy solid
after lyophilization.

General Procedure B for Coupling of NHS-Activated
Pentynoic
Acid
To a solution of glycocluster (1 equiv) in dry DMF (200
μL) were added diisopropylethylamine (3 equiv) and N-succinimidyl pentynoate (1.5 equiv). The mixture was stirred at
room temperature (rt) for 1 h, after which UPLC analysis showed complete
conversion. H2O (3 mL) was then added to the mixture, which
was purified by semipreparative RP-HPLC (5–40% solvent B in
15 min) to afford the desired compound as a white fluffy solid after
lyophilization.

Microarray Fabrication
Samples were
dissolved in ultrapure
H2O to prepare stock solutions (1 mM) and then diluted
in PBS 1× (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 8.5) containing 5%
glycerol. Glycerol was used to prevent evaporation during spotting
steps. The solutions of glycoconjugates (20 μL, 100 μM
to 0.03 μM) were transferred in a 384-well plate and then spotted
in triplicate using a piezoelectric microspotter (sciFLEXARRAYER S3,
Scienion AG, Germany) on NHS-coated glass slides (Nexterion, Slide
H, Schott). During the printing step, the humidity was monitored by
a humidifier in the spotter enclosure (75% humidity) to prevent the
evaporation of the spots. Each spot position was fixed with the software
of the spotter. A distance of 480–500 μm between the
centers of adjacent spots was imposed, and each probe was spotted
in triplicate (6–7 drops, 400 pL/drop, spot size 200 μm).
After completion of the printing step, glass slides were incubated
in a humidity chamber (70% humidity imposed by saturated NaCl) for
17–20 h. The slides were dipped into the blocking solution
(PBS 1×, 100 mM boric acid, 25 mM ethanolamine, 0.01% Tween 20,
pH 8.5) to deactivate unreacted NHS-functions and agitated for 1 h
at 37 °C. Slides were washed in PBS 1× containing 0.1% Tween
20 (3×, 3 min) and then were rinsed in PBS 1× (3×,
3 min) and in ultrapure H2O to remove salt. Slides were
dried with argon and directly used for interaction or competition
assays. Slides can also be conserved in H2O in a fridge
for 1 month without observing any alteration.

Binding Studies
Interaction
Assay Procedure
Printed slides were disposed
into 16-well masks. Fields containing immobilized glycoconjugates
were probed with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled H. pomatia agglutinin lectin (HPA) (80 μL, 2 μg/mL to 2 ng/mL)
in PBS 1× containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Bovine serum
albumin was added to prevent nonspecific interaction of lectin with
the slide and minimize the background signal. Slides were washed in
PBS 1× containing 0.1% Tween 20 (3×, 10 min) under gentle
agitation to remove unbound lectins and then were rinsed in PBS 1×
(3×, 3 min) and in ultrapure H2O to remove salt. Slides
were finally dried under argon and scanned (Labomix Innoscan 710,
red laser, excitation wavelength 635 nm).

Kd Evaluation
Interaction
assays were performed using the same protocol. Immobilized glycoconjugates
were probed with 25 μg/mL to 50 ng/mL Alexa Fluor 647-labeled H. pomatia agglutinin lectin (HPA) to ensure an excess
of lectin.

Competition Assay Protocol and IC50 Evaluation
In protein low-bind eppendorf tubes, the concentration
range of
commercial GalNAc (50 mM to 1 μM) was prepared in a solution
containing Alexa Fluor 647-labeled H. pomatia agglutinin lectin (HPA) (1 ng/mL) in PBS 1× containing 0.1%
BSA. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C under agitation.
Printed slides were disposed into 16-well masks. Fields containing
immobilized glycoconjugates were probed with the previously incubated
solutions containing GalNAc/HPA lectin. Slides were incubated for
1 h at 37 °C under slow agitation. Slides were washed in PBS
1× containing 0.1% Tween 20 (3×, 10 min) under gentle agitation
to remove unbound lectins and the competitor and then were rinsed
in PBS 1× (3×, 3 min) and in ultrapure H2O to
remove salt. Slides were finally dried under argon and scanned.

Data Analyses
Scans were analyzed with Mapix. To analyze
the entire range of spots including inhomogeneous ones, a fixed diameter
was imposed (200 μm), equivalent to the minimal diameter observed
on the slide. Data were treated with Excel and GraphPad Prism 6. To
evaluate the interaction and approximatively determine Kd values, a hyperbole model was used to fit the data,
with Y being the mean fluorescence and X being the concentration in lectin. To obtain an accurate value of Kd, a linear regression Y = AX + B was plotted (see equation below)
and Kd was determined. To evaluate IC50 values, a sigmoidal model (4PL model), which is a variable
slope model, was used to fit the data, with Y being
the mean fluorescence and X being the log of the
concentration in competitor introduced.
