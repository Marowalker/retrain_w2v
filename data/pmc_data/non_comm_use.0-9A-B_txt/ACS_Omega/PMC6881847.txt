The
1,8-naphthalimide (NI) derivative Lumogen F Violet 570 exhibits
different photoluminescence (PL) and aggregation-caused quenching
properties due to its crystal polymorphism, which depends on the solvent
evaporation process in tetrahydrofuran solution. In the slow drying
process, molecules aggregated into an energetically more stable form
(time-dependent density functional theory calculation), of which the
PL peak maximum was 453 nm, corresponding to blue emission at the
365 nm excitation. However, the fast evaporation process induces an
energetically less stable form, with a PL peak maximum of 508 nm,
corresponding to green emission. The main difference between the two
crystal structures is the alkyl conformation, as confirmed by X-ray
single-crystal analysis. Due to the different alkyl conformations,
NI groups aggregated into more obliquely aligned structures that emit
blue PL, which plays a role in weakening the π–π
interactions between molecules relative to green PL crystals. We found
that the conformational stable molecular stacking induced instability
in the electronic energy levels of the blue crystal compared to the
green crystal.

==== Body
1 Introduction
1,8-Naphthalimide
(NI) exhibits unique optical properties: it absorbs
UV-region light and emits visible range light. It has been reported
that the unique optical properties of NI are related to the transition
of the electronic states of molecules from lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) to highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and vice
versa.1 It is easy to control the photophysical
properties of NI because it is not difficult to chemically modify
the naphtha group and N component of imide.2,3 Therefore,
NI has been widely used not only in the dye industry but also in various
applications, including biomarker/biosensors,4,5 organic
light-emitting diodes,6,7 solar cells,8−15 luminescent solar concentrators,16,17 and X-ray
scintillators.18

Despite its unique
optical properties and potential for diverse
applications, NI has inevitable problems due to the enriched intermolecular
π electrons of NI groups, which are related to strong intermolecular
interactions induced by H-type aggregation, resulting in a reduction
(quenching) of the photoluminescent (PL) efficiency.19−21 To overcome H-type aggregation and aggregation-caused quenching
(ACQ), researchers often adopt substituents in NI molecules to maintain
the high fluorescence emission by interrupting the π interaction
in the aggregate states of the molecules. Adopting a substituent is
very effective for solving the ACQ problem, but it will unavoidably
distort the physical/optoelectronic properties of the molecule by
inducing chemical changes due to the substituent. Compared to a substituent,
different intermolecular interactions could be expected in polymorphisms
of a molecule. Organic molecules could have different molecular stackings,
resulting in various crystal forms, without requiring any additional
substituent. Despite their importance in the control of optoelectronic
properties, polymorphisms have not been noted in NI molecules and
few studies have been performed on them. In this work, we present
two different crystalline states relating to the optoelectronic properties
of the NI derivative Lumogen F Violet 570 (V570), which are dependent
on the fabrication process in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The
ACQ could be suppressed in one crystal form, which emits blue PL due
to the weakened π interaction in comparison to the other crystal
form, which emits green PL.

2 Results and Discussion
We dissolved 100 mg of V570 powder in 3 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF)
at room temperature and dried the solution at two evaporation rates,
3.9 (slow) and 89.6 mg/min (fast), as shown in Figure 1a. (The evaporation rate was measured by
the evaporation weight of the solvent over time; see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information.) As shown in Figure 1a, the fast-dried
powder was green under a 365 nm light-emitting lamp, while the slow-dried
powder was blue. Figure 1b shows the absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the
solution (5.414 × 10–5 M, 0.002 wt %), blue
and green powders. The absorption spectra of blue and green powders
were measured using the diffuse reflection measurement method and
Kubelka–Munk function, as shown in Figure S2.22,23 In the case of the solution,
the absorption peak was 372 nm and the PL maximum peak was 428 nm
under the excitation condition of 365 nm. Under the same excitation
conditions, the maximum PL emission peaks of the blue and green powders
were at 453 and 508 nm, respectively. In both cases, the maximum PL
wavelength was shifted to a longer wavelength in comparison to the
solution. This was related to the larger intermolecular interactions
in the powders than the solution. The photoluminescence quantum yield
(PLQY) of the two powders was measured using a PL photometer with
an integrating sphere, as shown in Figure S3, and it was calculated using a method proposed in the literature.24 Compared to ∼100% PLQY in low-doping
film,25 the PLQY was ∼43% in the
blue luminescent powder, while it was 8.3% in the green luminescent
powder, as shown in Figure 1c. The suppressed PLQY in the two powders originated from
the intermolecular π interactions in the solid, as previously
mentioned.26 We expected the π interactions
to be weaker in the blue powder than in the green powder.

To understand the different PL
properties, we carried out an X-ray
single-crystal analysis of blue and green crystals at the 2D beamline
in PLS-II (Pohang, Korea). The single crystals were obtained by slow
evaporation of the THF solvent. Green crystals formed in the fast-drying
state but could also be obtained by slow drying when small green seeds
were prepared for the initial state. We tried to fabricate single
crystals with acetone and obtained blue crystals at a low temperature
(4 °C). The crystal structure of blue from acetone was consistent
with the structure from THF, which was confirmed by single crystal
X-ray crystallography and analysis. Compared with blue crystals, green
crystals were not obtained in acetone.

In Table 1, we summarize
the results of the crystal data from X-ray analysis (see Figure S4 for a detailed structure). In Figure S5, the powders and single crystals exhibited
similar X-ray diffraction patterns and emission spectra. Hence, we
can regard the crystal structures of the powders as the same as those
of single crystals.

Based on the unit cell information, we compared the
molecular stacking
of the blue and green crystals, as shown in Figure 2.27 The dotted
arrow in Figure 2a
is parallel to the a axis and is connected to C7
(Figure 3c) of a molecule
in a unit cell. A unit cell consisted of two molecules, which were
stacked in the a-direction, as shown in Figure 2a. In Figure 2b, the lengths of the hydrogen
bonds between adjacent molecules were 2.61 and 2.55 Å. As a result,
continuous hydrogen bonds formed in the blue crystals. On the other
hand, green crystals did not form continuous hydrogen bonds between
adjacent molecules due to the large bonding length (2.84 Å).
The different stacking sequences between blue and green crystals were
related to the different alkyl group conformations, as shown in Figure 2c. C15–C16
covalent bonding was in the opposite direction with respect to the
NI planes of the blue and green crystals. Furthermore, the alkyl chains
were more outstretched in the normal direction from the NI plane in
the blue crystal than in the green crystal.

NI planes (projection view).

The NI plane stacking of the two-crystal form is depicted along
the direction of the a axis, as shown in Figure 3. The NI stacking
can be explained in terms of the positions of the neighboring NI planes
and hindrance caused by alkyl conformation. Head-to-tail (HT) stacking
refers to stacking between naphthalene (H) and imide (T) groups, while
head-to-head (HH) stacking is vertical stacking between naphthalene
(H) and naphthalene (H) groups. The NI stacking of blue crystal was
HT and HH, in that order. Two alkyl chains were folded out from the
NI stacking in the case of HT, and two alkyl chains were folded in
towards the NI stacking in the case of HH. In the out-folding case,
the NI groups could approach each other because there was relatively
less interference with the neighboring alkyl chains due to the outstretched
conformation. However, in the in-folding case, the NI group was more
disturbed due to the in-folding conformation of the alkyl chains,
and the NI group was spaced apart from the neighboring NI group.

Figure 3c,d shows
top views of the HH and HT molecular stacking in blue and green crystals.
Although the same HT stacking was observed in the blue and green crystals,
the detailed structures of the HT were different. The two V570 molecules
of the blue crystals had an oblique HT stacking, while the molecules
of the green crystal had a parallel HT stacking. The difference in
HT stacking can be explained by the length of the alkyl groups outside
the NI plane, as mentioned previously (see Figure 2). Compared to the green crystal, the outstretched
alkyl chain distance is long enough to interfere with the NI stacking
in the blue crystal. Due to the lesser degree of overlap in the HT
stacking, π bonding between two NI groups was weak in the blue
crystal compared to the green crystal.

The total energy difference
of blue and green crystals as a monomer
state was calculated by using time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT), as shown in Figure 4a. For calculation, we used the double numerical basis sets
with polarization level with the generalized gradient approximation
of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.28 We used all-electron Kohn–Sham wave functions
and the spin-unrestricted DFT computation. The self-consistent field
convergence of 10–6 Ha is obtained with a cut-off
radius of 3.7 Å. The blue crystal has a more stable state than
green crystal, and the energy difference between them was 34.1 kJ/mol.
The blue crystal formed under slow evaporation, as mentioned previously,
which implies that it was more stable than the green crystal. The
results of our energy calculations are consistent with both the crystal
formation conditions and our expectations. The NI group conformations
of the blue and green crystals were similar. Therefore, we consider
the energy difference to be mainly related to the conformation of
the alkyl group.

Figure 4 (a) Total energy diagram under the blue and green monomer
conditions.
(b) The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest occupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) state energy diagrams with increased V570
stacking along the a axis.

The energies of the HOMO and LUMO electronic states were calculated
using the TDDFT method, as shown in Figure 4b. We calculated the electronic energy states
from monomers to tetramers, for which the molecular stacking direction
was along the a axis. The HOMO and LUMO energies
of the blue and green crystals were almost the same in the monomer
state because the HOMO and LUMO electronic states are derived not
from the alkyl group but rather from the π electron-conjugated
system of the NI group.1 The optical band
gap from the absorption spectrum (Figure S2) was 3.26 eV in the blue powder and 3.28 eV in the green powder.

In the dimer system, the molecular stacking corresponds to HT in
the blue crystal, while it corresponds to HH in the green crystal.
The HOMO and LUMO energies of blue are higher than those of green,
which implies that HH is more stable than HT. In the case of the trimer
system, HT and HH are included in the blue crystal, and HH and HT
are included in the green crystal. As shown in Figure 3c,d, HHs of blue and green are similar, but
HTs are oblique in the blue crystal. Therefore, the energy difference
in the trimer system is mainly due to differences in HT states between
the blue and green crystals. From our calculation, we confirmed that
the oblique stacking was less stable than the parallel stacking because
there were higher HOMO/LUMO energy states in the blue versus green
crystals.

We also calculated the changes in the excitation energy
through
structural optimization in the first excited state (S1),
using TDDFT to elucidate the different emission characteristics of
the blue and green crystals of V570. As shown in Figure S6, the excitation states obtained via optimization
were not significantly different in the monomer states of the blue
and green crystals. Therefore, we confirmed that the PL properties
of blue and green were not derived from the monomer state but rather
from the crystal structure.

3 Conclusions
We detected
polymorphism in V570 molecules, i.e., blue and green
emission crystals, depending on the evaporation rate of the solution
during crystal formation. The PLQY of the green powder was as low
as 8.2%, while it was 43% in the blue powder. We confirmed that the
different PLQY properties and efficiencies originated from different
π interactions, mainly relating to the alkyl chain conformation
of the two states. The π interaction was weaker and HOMO/LUMO
energy states were higher in the blue crystal in comparison to the
green crystal. Interestingly, the conformational stable molecular
stacking induced unstable electronic energy levels in the blue crystals
compared to the green crystals.
