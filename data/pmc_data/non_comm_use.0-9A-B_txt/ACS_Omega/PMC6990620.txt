==== Body
After our paper was published online, we discovered incorrect information
given in Figures 4F
and 5A. Figure 4F should have described the fluorescence microscopic
images of S. aureus after exposure
to 200 μg/mL BQAS, but in the published paper, Figure 4F showed the result for S. aureus after exposure to 100 μg/mL BQAS. Figure 5A should have described
the SEM images of E. coli incubated
with 200 μL of BQAS (200 μg/mL), but in the published
paper, Figure 5A showed
the result of B. subtilis incubated
with 200 μL of BQAS (200 μg/mL). To address these corrections,
the corrected Figures 4 and 5 appear below.

Figure 4 Figure 5 These errata do
not affect any of the experimental results, discussions, or conclusions
reported in the paper. The authors sincerely apologize for the unintended
oversight.
