==== Body
On behalf of our ACS Omega editorial team, we wish
our authors, readers, and reviewers a very Happy New Year. As we enter
the year 2020, to celebrate our journal’s fifth anniversary,
we reflect on ACS Omega’s progress and achievements
in 2019 from a performance viewpoint. We also gratefully acknowledge
your contributions to the success of our journal and chart our vision
for 2020.

During 2019, ACS Omega published
a total of 2,488
primary research Articles, including six Mini-Reviews and 13 Perspectives,
representing a growth of 21.7% compared to 2018. Notably,
there was an evident surge in authorship from the East Asia and Pacific
region, accounting for 43% of published content, up over 10% from
20181 (Figure 1). The journal published several articles
in 2019 that were selected as ACS Editors’ Choice (https://pubs.acs.org/editorschoice/) (Table 1), and quite
a few gained traction on social media and news outlets (Table 2, Altmetric attention score
of >50). We are delighted that over 100 corresponding authors have
submitted five or more articles to ACS Omega since
our launch in 2016 and proud to count among our authorship the 2019
winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, M. Stanley Whittingham (DOIs: 10.1021/acsomega.8b00763; 10.1021/acsomega.8b03637; 10.1021/acsomega.9b02417). We thank all of our new and returning authors for their submissions
and congratulate our authors who had their articles published in ACS Omega in 2019. We continue to stand by our journal mission
to judge each manuscript on its quality and technical soundness, rather
than perceived impact. Nevertheless, we are pleased to note that our
next impact factor is already tracking higher than our inaugural one
released in the summer of 2019.2

2019 is shown based upon the country of the corresponding author.

In 2019, the
downloads of published articles crossed 2.4 million,
a growth of 65% over 2018 (Figure 2). Our global readership is apparent in Figure 2 (right panel), with the highest
percentage of article accesses originating from the United States
(27%), followed by China (23%). Accomplishing our mission as a fully
open access journal, in 2019, 54% of our readership profile was made
up of nonsubscribers, versus 46% ACS institutional subscribers. The
honor for an article
published in 2019 with the highest number of accesses was “Rheology
of Swiss Cheese Fondue” (DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b02424) with 16,181 views.

Figure 2 Shown on the left is the growth in the annual usage of
published
content in ACS Omega. The right-hand image highlights
the geographic distribution of readership in 2019.

Our reviewer pool grew substantially in 2019 to 8,078 unique
reviewers
from 91 countries, an increase in reviewer number of 35.2% compared
with 2018.1 We sincerely thank each reviewer
(Supplementary Table S1), including those
who have reviewed
more than once, for their assistance in our editorial decision making
and for the role they have played in maintaining the quality of ACS Omega. We are greatly indebted to our eminent pool of
prolific reviewers who have returned multiple reviews to the journal
(Supplementary Table S2). To recognize
the contributions of, and foster engagement with our new reviewers,
those who complete two or more reviews (for any ACS journal) over
12 months will be gifted an annual membership to the American Chemical
Society. We also thank the editors from our sister ACS journals for
their continued assistance in the manuscript transfer process and
suggesting high-quality articles for consideration to ACS
Omega. We must mention that via the newly launched ACS Reviewer
Credit program (https://publish.acs.org/publish/peer_reviews/reviewer_credit/) those referees who originally review a manuscript at another ACS
journal, and again return reviews for the same manuscript transferred
to ACS Omega, gain review credits for both the original
journal and ACS Omega.

Last year, we increased
editorial capacity in a bid to manage the
growing number of submissions and to provide a good publishing experience
for our authors by maintaining fast processing times for decision
making. The journal added three new Associate Editors to the team
in 2019: Professors Swagata Dasgupta (IIT Kharagpur, India), Sarbajit
Banerjee (Texas A&M University,
USA), and Jeehiun Lee (Rutgers University, USA). Additionally, a new
Development Editor, Dr. Ajay Jha, and two Publishing Editors, Dr.
Paul Goring and Dr. Silvia Imberti, were recruited to assist us in
processing manuscripts. Our average processing time to first decision
remains at a highly competitive 24 days.

In August 2019, ACS Omega moved to a weekly publication
schedule, featuring regular issues and ASAP article publications.
By popular demand, since issue 8 in 2019, the journal introduced front
covers and supplementary covers. We encourage you to submit your artwork
to compete for these covers, as it serves as a great way to promote
your work (Figure 3). In addition to our high-quality, weekly journal issues, in 2020,
we will work with our editorial team to create online collections
of previously published research on areas of current scientific interest.
These Virtual Collections will include both Virtual Issues and Thematic Collections and will be designed not only for experienced researchers but will also serve as a tool to teach students about the diverse areas of the chemical sciences. Since our launch, ACS Omega has published articles in every area of chemistry, both pure and
applied, as well as interfacing
areas (Figure 4), and
we expect these Virtual Collections to be popular among our readership.

program. Artwork corresponds to DOIs: 10.1021/acsomega.9b02126 (left); 10.1021/acsomega.9b00991 (middle); and 10.1021/acsomega.9b01920 (right). Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society; used with permission.

Figure 4 Taxonomy breakdown of research areas for articles published
in ACS Omega (accessed 8th January 2020). The “Others”
category includes Chemical biology; Earth, space, and environmental
chemistry; Organometallic chemistry; Supramolecular chemistry; Agriculture
and food chemistry; Nuclear chemistry; and Chemistry education.

To go along with the global celebrations of the
International Year
of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements in 2019, ACS Omega substantially increased support and sponsorship to conferences,
symposia, and meetings, including oral and poster prizes. In total,
the journal provided 65 sponsorships, an increase of over 90% compared
to 2018. In 2020, we will endeavor to continue to support and engage
our global community of scientists. We once again thank our authors,
readers, and reviewers for their contributions in making our broad-scope
journal a successful “community of communities” journal
and encourage you to stay actively involved with the journal. We look
forward to celebrating our continued collaboration throughout our
fifth anniversary, and beyond.
