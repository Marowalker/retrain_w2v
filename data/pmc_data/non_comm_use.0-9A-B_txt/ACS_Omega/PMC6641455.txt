A mononuclear
iron(II) complex that displays a gradual two-step
spin-crossover (SCO) transition is reported. The intermediate plateau
(IP) occurs between HS0.40LS0.60 and HS0.30LS0.70 (HS = high spin; LS = low spin) ratios
over the region of ca. 190–170 K. A phase change occurs at
the IP, breaking the symmetry, resulting in six independent SCO sites
compared to one at the 100% HS and LS plateau regions, respectively.
Variable-temperature X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the
SCO behavior is completely reversible among the HS, IP, and LS regions.
The results both confirm and extend the related results for the above
system described by Halcrow et al. (Kulmaczewski R. ; Cespedes O. ; Halcrow M. A.  Gradual Thermal Spin-Crossover Mediated By a Reentrant Z′ = 1 → Z′ = 6 → Z′ = 1 Phase Transition , Inorg. Chem . 2017 , 56 , 3144 −3148 28244751 ) in a recent report.

==== Body
Introduction
Spin-crossover (SCO)
materials show significant promise for application
in several emerging technologies, including molecular switches, sensors,
displays, molecular electronics, and spintronics.1−4 Although a large number of such
materials have been developed, leading to a good understanding of
the intramolecular properties (choice of metal ion, donor atom, sterics,
etc.)1,2,5−11 that affect spin transitions in discrete complexes, the results
of cooperative intramolecular effects (leading to hysteresis, sharp
transitions, etc.)1,2,5,12 are still not readily predictable. This
is particularly the case for supramolecular effects involving weak
noncovalent interactions and/or crystal packing.13−18 Extremely recently, Halcrow et al.19 have
reported the crystal structure and SCO properties of [FeL]·(BF4)2 (L = tris(2-(((E)-thiazol-4-ylmethylene)amino)ethyl)amine), which features
a two-step spin transition together with a symmetry-breaking phase
change. Illustrating the immense interest in the field, we had been
simultaneously and independently investigating the same material.
Our results are largely consistent with those of Halcrow et al.19 Here, we present complementary results, including
the high-resolution crystal structure of the intermediate phase (190
K), that clarify the symmetry-breaking nature of the phase transition:
variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements with slow
scan rates, and variable-temperature X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(VT-XPS).

Results and Discussion
The [FeL]·(BF4)2 (Figure 1) complex was prepared
in a similar manner to that reported by Halcrow et al.,19 and we prepared single crystals by the slow
diffusion of diethyl ether into an acetonitrile solution. The composition
and purity of [FeL]·(BF4)2 was established by elemental analysis, high-resolution electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry, solid-state UV–vis spectroscopy,
IR spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction (see Supporting Information).

[FeL]2+ cations (Fe–Fe separation,

Variable-temperature magnetic
susceptibility measurements for [FeL]·(BF4)2 revealed the presence
of a complete nonhysteretic SCO transition with a two-step character
(Figure 2). These results
are consistent with those of Halcrow et al.19 The two-step character arises from a change in slope over the region
of ca. 190–170 K, representative of an intermediate plateau
(IP) (however with declining rather than stable χMT values). At 190 K, the χMT value of ca. 1.25 cm3 mol–1 K corresponds to a high spin (HS)/low spin (LS) ratio of ca. 40:60
of Fe(II) sites, which drops to an HS/LS ratio of ca. 30:70 by 170
K.

a scan rate of 2 K min–1. Inset: first derivative
of the SCO transition highlighting the two-step character (1 and 2).

VT-XPS (Figure 3 and see Supporting Information) showed
the expected changes arising from the spin state on the Fe 2p3/2 peak.21,22 On X-ray ionization, compounds
of the 3d transition metals undergo a coupling between the ionized
2p shell and the 3d shell to form multiplets, with an intensity dependent
on the number of unpaired electrons in the 3d shell.23 Hence, the Fe 2p3/2 peak of the HS complex at
298 K splits into relatively intense multiplets (peaks B–D).
On cooling to 190 K, the combined normalized intensity of multiplets
B–D decreases (inset in Figure 4), until a typical LS Fe(II) spectrum is observed at
100 K. The spin behavior is completely reversible, with the HS spectrum
observed on warming to 298 K.

[FeL]2+ moieties, which associate into three
interacting pairs. Relative spin states of the Fe(II) sites indicated
(HS: red, LS: purple, and mixed HS–LS: cyan. Anions and regions
of disorder have been omitted for clarity).

We also determined single-crystal X-ray structures of the
HS state
(298 K), the intermediate phase (190 K), and the LS state (100 K)
(Table S1). Whereas the HS and LS structures
are consistent with Halcrow’s results, the previous report
on the structure of the symmetry-broken intermediate phase (Z′ = 6, compared to Z′ =
1 at room and low temperature) determined at 175 K “has relatively
low precision, reflecting the size of the model and significant cation
and anion disorder, which was only partly resolvable”.19 With careful attention to obtaining a suitable
crystal, we were able to obtain data of high quality and without substantial
disorder.

Detailed analysis (average Fe–N bond lengths
and relative
Fe(II) octahedral distortion) reveals two HS (Fe(2) and Fe(3)), two
LS (Fe(4) and Fe(6)), and two mixed HS–LS Fe(II) sites (Fe(1)
and Fe(5)) at 190 K (Figure 4). The spin-state assignment for the complete HS and LS sites
was clear on the basis of the average Fe–N bond lengths and
relative octahedral distortion at these sites (Table S1). On the basis of the complete HS and LS values above,
respectively, the mixed HS–LS Fe(II) sites (i.e., of short-range
crystallographic order) are of more LS character than HS. This assignment
of short- and long-range ordered HS and LS states over the six distinct
Fe(II) sites correlates well with the 40:60 HS/LS ratio observed magnetically
at this temperature (Figure 2). We note that the detailed structural analysis reported
on this phase by Halcrow et al. was conducted at 175 K, revealing
three LS, one HS, and two mixed HS–LS Fe(II) sites, representative
of a 30:70 HS/LS ratio as per magnetic measurements. From this, it
is interesting then to observe that one of the mixed HS + LS sites
attains a complete LS character over the duration of the “sloped”
IP temperature range (i.e., 190–170 K).

The [FeL]2+ cations at 190 K are arranged
in three distinct dimers comprising two mixed spin-state pairs (HS–LS)
and one LS state pair (LS–LS) (Figure 4). These three unique pairs are distributed
in distinct one-dimensional (1D) chains along the a-direction, as illustrated in Figure 5. Spin-state/dimer confinement is also evident when
viewed along the b-direction (Figure 5b). The origin for the molecular arrangement
of Fe(II) spin states along the 1D chains is likely driven by lattice
cooperativity, which arises from packing and short spin-center separations.
This produces molecular-level spin-state domain formation within the
1D chains, which is conferred to a 3D spin-state patterning.

spin states in the lattice (HS: red, LS: purple, and mixed HS–LS:
cyan). Anions, hydrogens, and regions of disorder have been omitted
for clarity) viewed along the (a) a-direction and
(b) c-direction.

Conclusions
We have verified the findings of Halcrow et
al.,19 which describe a new discrete mononuclear
Fe(II) tripodal
complex that displays a two-step SCO behavior. At the intermediate
phase, six independent spin sites are present, resulting in 3D spin-state
patterning. Although there are no particular structural features and/or
interactions that obviously contribute to this distinctive phase transition
and rare spin-state patterning, we note that the overall strain involved
in the hexadentate ligand type to accommodate the HS to LS transition
may be a contributing factor.

Materials
All
chemicals and solvents used were of commercial
grade and used without further purification.

Experimental Section
L Tris(2-aminoethyl)-amine
(104 mg, 0.71 mmol)
in 10 mL of ethanol was added to a solution of thiazole-4-carboxaldehyde
(250 mg, 2.21 mmol) in 10 mL of ethanol, leading to the formation
of a clear yellow solution. The mixture was heated at reflux for 3
h, and then the resulting yellow solution was left at 70 °C with
overnight stirring. The residue obtained after the removal of the
solvent was dissolved in acetonitrile for recrystallization. The crystallized product
was washed with cold acetonitrile (3 × 5 mL) to give a light
yellow solid in 67% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300
MHz) δ (ppm): 8.79 (d, 3H), 8.39 (s, 3H), 7.72 (d, 3H), 3.73
(t, 6H, −CH2−), 2.96 (t,
6H, −CH2−); 13C NMR (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 75.5 MHz) δ (ppm): 155.63,
154.63, 153.15, 119.73, 60.08 (−CH2−), 55.43 (−CH2−);

[Na + L]+.

[FeL](BF4)2 (1) Iron(II) tetrafluoroborate hexahydrate (41
mg, 0.12 mmol) in 10 mL of acetonitrile was slowly added to a suspension
of L (50 mg, 0.12 mmol) in 10 mL of acetonitrile; there
was an immediate color change from yellow to red. The reaction mixture
was heated at 50 °C with stirring for 4 h and then cooled to
room temperature and filtered. Slow diffusion of diethyl ether into
the filtrate of the product resulted in the formation of dark orange
crystals in 83% yield, which were air dried. UV–vis (solid
state in nujol): λmax 256, 368, 476 nm; FT-IR (ATR
νmax, cm–1): 3104, 2860, 1633,

ESI-HRMS (positive-ion detection, CH3CN): m/z = 543.5168 [Fe + L]2+ and 574.0453 [Fe + L + BF4–]+. Single crystals were taken from the same sample and
used directly for the X-ray study.
