Density
functional theory was used to study dissociative chemisorption
and desorption on PdxNiy (x + y = 6) bimetallic clusters.
The H2 dissociative chemisorption energies and the H desorption
energies at full H saturation were computed. It was found that bimetallic
clusters tend to have higher chemisorption energy than pure clusters,
and the capacity of Pd3Ni3 and Pd2Ni4 clusters to adsorb H atoms is substantially higher
than that of other clusters. The H desorption energies of Pd3Ni3 and Pd2Ni4 are also lower than
that of the Pd6 cluster and comparable to that of the Ni6 cluster, indicating that it is easier to pull the H atom
out of these bimetallic catalysts. This suggests that the catalytic
efficiency for specific PdxNiy bimetallic clusters may be superior to bare Ni or
Pd clusters and that it may be possible to tune bimetallic nanoparticles
to obtain better catalytic performance.

Introduction
The catalyzed chemical reactions of transition
metals are important
industrial processes and have been studied both theoretically and
experimentally for years.1−4 Nickel family metals, including platinum, palladium,
and nickel, are three of the most efficient catalysts. Palladium and
platinum catalysts have been utilized in chemical processes such as
reduction, hydrogenation, and oxidation.5−13 The hydrides of nickel family metals have been used for applications
in fuel cells, batteries, and hydrogen purifications,14−17 and platinum is known to be an especially efficient catalyst for
the hydrogen dissociation process.18 It
is widely recognized that chemical reactions occur at the defect sites
and sharp corners of catalysts,19−21 and the size of the metal catalytic
particles varies from nanoscale to mesoscale.6,22,23 Many studies have demonstrated that nanosized
catalytic particles are more chemically active than their corresponding
bulk counterparts.5

Single crystalline
surface models at low H coverage have been employed
to represent catalyst surfaces in many theoretical studies.24,25 The structures of small metal clusters have been widely studied
both experimentally26−30 and theoretically.31−39 Computationally, rigorous quantum mechanical modeling on Pd–Ni
bimetallic catalyst nanoparticles with a realistic size is prohibitively
difficult for the following reasons: (1) the catalyst nanoparticles
usually contain thousands of atoms, (2) there are a large number of
structural configurations for a given size of nanoparticle, and (3)
there are numerous unpaired d-electrons in the nanoparticles. We thus
choose a given size subnano cluster to represent the Pd–Ni
bimetallic catalyst. Though such an unrealistically small cluster
size may not adequately represent the detailed structures and properties
of an actual Pd–Ni catalyst nanoparticle, it does allow for
a systematic study which may demonstrate the catalytic process well
enough to provide useful insights into the mechanisms. Such a subnano
cluster model has been shown to be capable of providing useful information
on the catalytic properties.13,40−42

The surface of a realistic catalyst is expected to be fully
covered
by either molecular or atomic hydrogen when the pressure is constantly
maintained. Consequently, the catalytic performance of hydrogenation
is critically dependent on how easily an H2 molecule dissociates
and how fast an H atom desorbs from a fully saturated surface. In
our previous work of sequential H2 dissociative chemisorption
on small clusters,45,51,53 we found that some of the most fundamental properties of catalytic
particles (the dissociative chemisorption energy of H2 and
the desorption energy of H atoms at full H coverage) do not change
significantly with particle size at full saturation of H atoms. Therefore,
we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations on H adsorption
on Pd–Ni clusters at high coverage.

The hydride formation
of small Pt,45,46 Pd,47−50,53 and Ni51 clusters has been systematically
studied. The properties of the
different metal clusters can vary considerably even within the same
family of the periodic table, and the interactions between these metals
and hydrogen may be considerably different.45−49,52 For example, the edge
sites were identified as the most energetically favorable binding
sites for H atoms on Ni clusters,51 whereas
both the hollow and edge sites are preferred on Pd clusters.45,47−49,53 Another study indicated
that the interaction between hydrogen and Pd clusters on nanoporous
carbon materials can significantly enhance the H adsorption capacity
of nanoporous carbon.44 The hydride structures
and vibrational spectra of Ni clusters calculated by Swart et al.54 indicated that Ni clusters can accommodate more
H atoms than other transition-metal clusters of the same size in the
same row of the periodic table.55 Additionally,
the charge on the cluster can also influence the reactivity of the
transition-metal catalysts.56 Although
noble metal catalysts like Pt or Pd are highly active in the dissociative
chemisorption and desorption processes, they are not substantial when
compared to Ni and may not justify the higher cost associated with
the limited availability of the precious metals. Furthermore, some
studies have noted that the alloying design can be an effective method
to improve the catalytic process.40,57,58 Hence, the introduction of Ni into a pure Pd cluster
may improve the catalytic performance and reduce the cost simultaneously.

In addition to the theoretical studies on monometallic clusters
like Pt, Pd, and Ni mentioned above, there have been studies of some
noble bimetallic clusters like Au/Pd43 and
some bimetallic clusters of transition metals like Fe/Cr clusters
and Al/Rh clusters.40 These studies mainly
focus on the stability, electronic structures,59−61 and growth
behavior.62 The selectivity of dehydrogenation
of organic molecules on transition-metal oxides63 and nitrides64 suggested that
the composition can influence both the activity and selectivity of
catalysts. However, the processes of hydrogen adsorption and desorption
on PdxNiy bimetallic
clusters with various compositions have not been systematically investigated.

In this paper, we conducted a systematic DFT study of hydride formation
of small PdxNiy bimetallic clusters at a given size (in the current study, x + y = 6), with the purpose of understanding
the activity of the catalytic process of these clusters with H2. The key properties, including H2 dissociative
chemisorption energy, the barrier energy of migration of H atoms on
the clusters, H atom desorption energy, and the maximum capacity for
accommodating H atoms are systematically addressed. The findings in
this study could provide useful insights into the catalytic performance
of the bimetallic clusters of Ni family and shed light on the design
of low-cost bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts.

Computational Details
All calculations were performed
using DFT/generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
exchange–correlation functional as implemented in the DMol3
package.65,66 The electronic structure calculations were
carried out using a spin-polarization scheme to deal with the open-shell
systems inherent to Ni and Pd atoms. A double numerical basis set
augmented with polarization functions was used to describe the valence
electrons and an effective core potential was employed to represent
the core electrons,67,68 as the valence electrons can
determine the molecules’ chemical properties and the basic
functions in Dmol3 are numerically exact atomic orbitals
rather than analytical functions. It has been shown that the quality
of this basis set gives rise to very little superposition effects.69 The Mulliken population division scheme was
used to analyze the charge transfer between atoms.69 The method used in the present study has been shown to
be capable of providing accurate structures and cohesive energies
of transition-metal elements in good agreement with the available
experimental values.45,51,53 All structures were fully optimized without symmetry constraints,
and the conjugated gradient algorithm was employed to search for energetically
most stable structures. For the clusters with a given size, a thorough
search for minimum energy structures was conducted. A DFT-D method
of Tkatchenko and Scheffler70 was tested
in our calculations. We found that the influence of dispersion corrections
on the final optimized structures and the energy change for chemisorption
and desorption energies were negligible. The structure search for
the transition state (TS) for H2 on a Pd3Ni3 cluster was done to gain insight into the barriers of H2 dissociative chemisorption kinetics and for H atom dispersal
in the cluster using the linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous
transit method.71 The TS structure was
verified by normal mode analysis that gives only one imaginary frequency.

The average formation energy (ΔEFE) of a cluster containing x Pd and y Ni atoms can be calculated using 1  where E(Ni) represents the
energy of the Ni atom, E(Pd) represents the energy
of the Pd atom, and E(NixPdy) represents the energy of the clusters.

The dissociative chemisorption energy of H2 and the
desorption energy of H atoms at full H coverage are of vital importance
for catalytic hydrogenation, as they determine how easily an H2 molecule dissociates into and how fast an H atom desorbs
from a fully H-saturated catalyst.53 The
dissociative chemisorption energy of H2 was calculated
using the following equation 2  where n is the number of
H atoms on the cluster, E(PdxNiyHn) is the energy of the cluster with H atoms, and E(H2) is the energy of H2.

A realistic
catalytic hydrogenation process is usually done at
a hydrogen pressure that maintains full or nearly full coverage of
the catalyst surfaces. Therefore, to evaluate the performance of a
metallic catalyst, one needs to examine the hydrogen desorption energy
from the cluster fully saturated by H. We note that H atoms are normally
released sequentially rather than simultaneously. Hence, the dissociative
chemisorption energy is not the energy required to desorb an H atom
from the cluster. In the present study, we compared the desorption
energies of different clusters fully saturated with H atoms using
the following equation 3  where E(H) is the energy
of the H atom and n represents the number of H atoms when the cluster
is fully saturated.

To verify whether a cluster is fully covered
by H atoms, we performed
room-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations on
the clusters deemed to be saturated for 3 ps in an NVT canonical ensemble using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat72,73 for temperature control. Excessive H atoms on the clusters will
recombine to form H2 molecules weakly associated with the
cluster upon the MD run.13

Results
and Discussion
The objective of the present study is to understand
the catalytic
properties of Pd/Ni bimetallic clusters with various compositions.
Our previous study on bare Ni and Pd clusters indicated that when
the cluster size is larger than six atoms, the change of the average
formation energy is relatively small.51 Therefore, we chose PdxNiy clusters that contain six atoms (x + y = 6) as a representative cluster model. For
a given size of cluster, there are numerous isomeric configurations
for the cluster structures with various compositions. To identify
the lowest energy structure of a bare PdxNiy cluster, we performed extensive structural
optimizations to obtain the closest stable geometric configuration. Figure 1 shows the calculated
lowest energy structures with their average formation energies and
the electron density difference of the clusters with different compositions.
It reveals that the formation energy increases with the formation
of PdxNiy alloy
clusters, and Ni4Pd2 possesses the highest formation
energy. Therefore, PdxNiy bimetallic clusters are more stable than Ni6 or
Pd6 monometallic clusters. The electron density difference
and Mulliken charge analysis (as shown in Figure 1) indicate that the electron density of Pd
atoms is higher than that of Ni atoms in PdxNiy bimetallic clusters because
of the electron transfer from the Ni atoms to the neighboring Pd atoms,
which is consistent with the fact that the electronegativity value
of Ni (1.91) is relatively lower than that of Pd (2.20). As expected,
the d-band center decreases gradually with the number of Pd atoms
in PdxNiy bimetallic
clusters (−3.42 eV of Ni6, −3.61 eV of Ni5Pd, −3.69 eV of Ni4Pd2, −3.83
eV of Ni3Pd3, −4.00 eV of Ni2Pd4, −4.08 eV of NiPd5, and −4.31
eV of Pd6). The stability of PdxNiy clusters and the charge distribution
on PdxNiy clusters
may significantly influence their capability to interact with hydrogen.

lowest energy geometries of the bare PdxNiy clusters (x + y = 6) with Mulliken charge distribution, calculated
electron density difference between a cluster and isolated atom, and
the average formation energy.

The structures with the maximum formation energy of PdxNiy clusters
were chosen
among their isomers for the study of H2 chemisorption process.
In the beginning of the chemisorption process, the H2 molecule
approaches the top sites of PdxNiy clusters. Typically, there are two positions
(Ni atom on the top sites and Pd atom on the top sites) that can accommodate
the H2 molecule. The calculated chemisorption structures
of H2 on PdxNiy clusters with the lowest energy and their dissociative
chemisorption energies are shown in Figure 2. The dissociative chemisorption energies
changed with the compositions of PdxNiy clusters. The bimetallic clusters tend to
have higher chemisorption energies, suggesting that the bimetallic
clusters are more readily able to absorb and dissociate H2 than the pure Ni6 or Pd6 clusters.

Figure 2 Calculated
structures and chemisorption energies of Ni (blue) and
Pd (yellow) top sites of different clusters.

Although the H2 chemisorption on the top sites
of PdxNiy clusters
is exothermic, it is not the most stable chemisorption configuration.
The H atoms exhibit high mobility in the hydride complex, and they
can easily diffuse to the twofold edge or threefold hollow sites. Figure 3 shows a detailed
analysis of this process for an octahedral Pd3Ni3 cluster. Initially, the H2 molecule approaches the cluster
from the on-top site (R1) and undergoes dissociative chemisorption
via the transition state (TS1) with a small barrier of 0.10 eV. This
leads to H adsorption on two neighboring edges (P1) with an energy
of −0.77 eV, which is the minimum energy structure for this
octahedral cluster. However, the H atoms can further diffuse to other
adsorption sites (e.g., from P1 to P2) with a relatively small barrier
(TS2), indicating that H2 dissociative chemisorption and
H diffusion processes are facile. A slightly larger barrier (TS3)
between P2 and P3 is also shown in the figure. The small barrier of
H2 dissociative chemisorption on bimetallic clusters and
the highly favorable reaction energies show that this process is thermodynamically
controlled, and the small diffusion barrier suggests that H migration
on the bimetallic cluster of Ni family is facile.

subsequent migration of the H atoms on the
Pd3Ni3 octahedral cluster.

The desorption energy of H on metal clusters at full saturation
is a chemical quantity of vital importance, for it can indicate the
catalytic activity. Therefore, we considered the sequential loading
of H2 until the cluster is fully saturated with H atoms.
In the process of H2 dissociative chemisorption on the
bimetallic metal cluster, the edge sites are populated at low H coverage.
As the H loading increases, some hollow sites and on-top sites are
also occupied. The saturation was checked by performing ab initio
MD runs at 300 K to ensure that all the H atoms are chemisorbed. Figure 4 displays the radial
distribution of the H–H distance of Pd3Ni3–H16 and Pd3Ni3–H18 clusters and shows that the H atoms in Pd3Ni3–H16 are well separated by at least 2.0
Å. However, the top panel of the figure shows a peak at approximately
0.8 Å, indicating that an H2 molecule was formed.
Therefore, the saturation limit is 16 H atoms for this bimetallic
cluster. To consider the entropic contributions and further verify
the result of AIMD, we calculated the free energy for the formation
of Pd3Ni3–H16 (Pd3Ni3 + 8H2 → Pd3Ni3–H16) and Pd3Ni3–H18 (Pd3Ni3 + 9H2 →
Pd3Ni3–H18) clusters at 300
K. The results showed that ΔG for the formation
of Pd3Ni3–H16 is −25.1
kcal/mol and that ΔG turned to a positive value
(3.1 kcal/mol) when the loading of H atoms increased to 18, indicating
that the Pd3Ni3 cluster is unable to absorb
one more H2 molecule spontaneously after reaching the maximum
capacity. A previous study51 revealed that
most of the Ni–H bond distances in Ni hydrides are between
1.6 and 1.7 Å, which are slightly shorter than the Pd–H
bond distances (1.7–1.8 Å) in Pd hydrides. For the PdxNiy bimetallic
clusters that we studied, both the Pd–H and Ni–H bond
distances are within the range of 1.6–1.8 Å, which is
consistent with the pure Ni or Pd clusters.

Figure 4 Calculated H–H
distance distribution g(r) of Pd3Ni3–H16 and Pd3Ni3–H18 clusters. g(r) was obtained by tabulating all the
H–H distances at each step of the AIMD trajectories fit with
Gaussian functions.

The optimized structures
of the fully H-saturated PdxNiy clusters (x + y = 6) and desorption energies are
shown in Figure 5.
When the number of Pd atoms is high, the hollow sites are more favorable
than the edge sites. With the increase of Ni atoms, the favorable
sites change from the threefold hollow sites to the edge sites. When
the number of Pd and Ni is close, the clusters (Pd3Ni3, Pd2Ni4) can load two more H atoms
(n = 16), compared to Ni6, Pd6, and other PdxNiy clusters (n = 14). After the 12 edges of
the Pd3Ni3 and Pd2Ni4 clusters
are occupied, there are four opposite on-top sites that are available
for another four H atoms. It appears that the charge transfer from
Ni atoms to the neighboring Pd atoms could make the on-top site load
more H atoms.

Figure 5 Optimized geometries of the fully saturated structures
with minimum
energies and the desorption energy when the first H atom was released.

The calculated maximum formation
energy of clusters, the H2 dissociative chemisorption energy,
maximum H capacity, and
the H desorption energy on PdxNiy (x + y = 6) clusters
are shown in Figure 6. The maximum formation energy of clusters reveals that the PdxNiy alloy clusters
possess higher formation energies than their pure cluster counterparts
(Figure 6a), indicating
they are more capable of maintaining their configuration when they
undergo the sequential H2 loading process. The H2 dissociative chemisorption energies ΔECE vary in a small energy range from 0.35 to 0.78 eV. Figure 6b shows that Pd3Ni3 and Pd4Ni2 have higher
H2 dissociative chemisorption energies than other PdxNiy clusters. Figure 6c shows the number
of H atoms when the cluster is fully saturated. The Pd3Ni3 and Pd2Ni4 clusters can accommodate
two more H atoms than the pure Pd and Ni clusters. The calculated
H atom desorption energies ΔE(DE) at full saturation of the metal clusters vary within the range of
2.06–2.68 eV (Figure 6d). The highest H desorption energy is observed for Ni5Pd1, which is slightly higher than other clusters.
When the number of Pd and Ni atoms is similar, for example, Pd3Ni3 and Pd2Ni4, the H desorption
energies are lower than that of other clusters, indicating that it
is easier to pull the H atom out of an appropriately tuned bimetallic
catalyst. From the above analysis, we may conclude that bimetallic
clusters with specific constitution (e.g., Pd3Ni3 and Pd2Ni4) have higher H2 dissociative
chemisorption energies, lower H desorption energy, and larger capacity
of H atoms, which could lead to their better catalytic performance.

on (a) maximum formation energy, (b) H2 dissociative
chemisorption energy, (c) maximum H capacity, and (d) H desorption
energy of small Ni, Pd, and PdxNiy (x + y = 6) bimetallic clusters.

Summary
We used DFT to study the chemical properties of
subnano PdxNiy bimetallic
clusters for x + y = 6. In general,
bimetallic clusters have higher average formation energies and chemisorption
energies than their pure cluster counterparts, which make them more
stable and effective absorbers of hydrogen. The lower desorption energies
make the H atoms facile to be pulled off from the surface of the clusters,
which could lead to a higher catalytic activity for hydrogenation
than that of the pure Pd or Ni clusters.51 The charge transfer from Ni to Pd increases the H capacity of Pd3Ni3 and Pd2Ni4 clusters by
two atoms compared to pure Pd6 and Ni6 clusters.
This represents a 14% increase for these bimetallic clusters, which
is expected to scale with the cluster size.51 Our findings show that the bimetallic clusters can have better catalytic
performance than the pure clusters and may provide useful insights
for tuning the component and interaction between the different metals
in the design of alloy catalysts.
