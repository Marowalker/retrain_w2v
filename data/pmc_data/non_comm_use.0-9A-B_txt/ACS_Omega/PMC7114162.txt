Growth
and physical properties of bulk REBa2Cu3O7−δ (REBCO) superconductors fabricated by
the infiltration growth (IG) method strongly depend on the initial
size and morphology of the RE2BaCuO5 (211) particles.
The present work details the novel method we developed for producing
sharp-edged and surface-damaged 211 particles to be added to the REBCO
bulks. We employed high-energy ultrasonic irradiation for pretreating
the 211 particles and fabricated high-performance bulk single-grain
YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) superconductors
via the top-seeded IG process. Increasing the ultrasound irradiation
power and time duration mechanically damaged the surface of the 211
particles, producing more fine and sharp edges. Systematic investigations
of the microstructural properties of the final YBCO bulks indicated
that the size and content of the 211 particles gradually decreased
without any additional chemical doping. The effective grain refinement
and improved interfacial defect densities enhanced the critical current
density by a factor of two at 77 K and self-field as compared to a
YBCO sample fabricated without any pretreatment. A maximum trapped
field of 0.48 T at 77 K was obtained for a sample (20 mm diameter)
with 211 particles treated for 60 min and 300 W ultrasound radiation.
The effectiveness of the novel method is demonstrated by the superior
performance of the YBCO bulk samples prepared as compared to bulk
samples fabricated with the addition of Pt and CeO2. This
method is novel, cost effective, and very convenient, maintaining
high sample homogeneity, and is free of chemical contaminants as compared
to other methods which significantly affect the properties of all
REBCO bulk products grown by sintering, melt growth, and IG methods.

1 Introduction
Bulk (Y/RE)Ba2Cu3O7−δ [(Y/RE)BCO, RE-123 or
123; RE = light rare-earth elements, Sm, Nd,
Eu, and Gd] superconductors are prominent applied materials and have
drawn much attention in the literature. This is mainly due to their
relatively high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), low flux creep, and low anisotropy. Many applications can be realized
because Tc of REBCO materials is well
above 77 K. Trapping of high magnetic fields by bulk (Y/RE)BCO superconductors
enables the fabrication of superconducting quasi-permanent magnets
for magnetic resonance imaging, NMR, friction-free flywheels for energy
storage, motors, and others.1−3 One of the important criteria
in the evaluation of the quality of a high-Tc superconductor is the Jc and
its temperature and field dependence. Therefore, improving the trapped
fields (TFs) and Jc, which stands up to
high fields and high temperatures, is the recent topic of research.

Jc is not an intrinsic property of
a superconductor and depends strongly on the final microstructure
achieved. Several parameters such as the homogenous distribution of
non-superconducting phases, oxygen content, cracks, and the coupling
at grain boundaries may affect the Jc of
the bulk REBCO materials. One of the most attempted approaches for
improving Jc in these materials is the
introduction of secondary phase inclusions.4,5 The
defects generated at the interface of non-superconducting and insulating
(Y/RE)2BaCuO5 (hereafter abbreviated as Y-211/RE-211,
211) particles within the 123 matrix and those associated with nano-inclusions,
dislocations, twins, and stacking faults have been proven to act as
efficient flux pinning centers. For optimum performance, the size
of these flux pinning sites should be comparable to 2ξ, the
superconducting coherence length. Several methods such as sintering,
melt growth (MG), and infiltration growth (IG) techniques have been
developed for synthesizing various REBCO bulks. The IG process is
found to be superior because of its advantageous merits such as the
near-net-shape formation, minute amount of macrodefects such as pores,
high dense microstructure embedded with fine-sized RE-211 inclusions,
and so forth. In our recent work, we compared all these methods comprehensively.6 In the IG method, it is well known that the initial
size of the RE-211 particles is considered to be dominant in the growth
of REBCO.7−9 Therefore, the production and utilization of smaller-sized
RE-211 particles is essential for the fabrication of high-quality
REBCO bulk materials which support high Jc and trap large magnetic fields.

It is also well known that
during the peritectic reaction between
RE-211 and liquid phases, the smaller RE-211 particles will be consumed
first to form the continuous 123 matrix. Employment of finer particles
thus results in a continuous matrix with finer RE-211 particles left
back. Much effort has been put through to the embedding of large fractions
of fine-sized, non-superconducting inclusions and their homogeneous
dispersion, which improves the interfacial defect density in the superconducting
bulk samples. Conventional solid-state reaction and chemical routes
and the combination of these with ball milling, coprecipitation, and
spray-drying produce spherical RE-211 phase particles in the powder
form with grain sizes ranging from submicron to several microns. To
refine the RE-211 particles in the final products, many methods such
as the addition of grain refiners (Pt, CeO2, Ba–Ce–O,
etc.) have been tried.10−15 However, these additives are economically costly and with chemical
addition, there always exist problems in maintaining the chemical
composition throughout the bulk, and the achieved homogeneity is questionable.
Ball milling is also limited to produce particles with ∼100
nm size, but milling for several hours results in the introduction
of impurities, which is not desirable. Hence, it is necessary to look
for new and advanced methods of producing nanometer-sized RE-211 phase
particles within the 123 matrix without using any chemical dopants.

Employing novel methods for producing the fine-sized RE-211 particles
and the successful incorporation into final IG-processed REBCO bulks
are still challenging.16−18 To address the above-mentioned problems and to improve
the properties of bulk REBCO, sharp-edged, surface-damaged, and nanometer-sized
RE-211 particles were produced employing the method of high-energy
ultrasonic irradiation. The manipulated RE-211 particles were then
utilized for fabricating single-grain YBCO bulk superconductors via
the top-seeded IG (TS-IG) method. Therefore, the present work reports
the systematic development of a novel method for the production of
surface-modified and nanometer-sized Y-211 particles, controlling
the content and size in the final bulk microstructures of bulk YBCO
samples, which significantly improves the field-dependence properties
and TFs. For comparison, we additionally fabricated a bulk YBCO sample
with the addition of Pt and CeO2 to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the present method.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Working Mechanism
The strength of
the superconductivity of REBCO materials largely depends on the crystal
imperfections developed in the samples during the growth. According
to various models available on the growth mechanism of REBCO superconductors,
the peritectic reaction progresses by consuming the RE reservoirs,
mainly the RE-211 phase, as given in eq 1. Recently, the utilization of nanotechnology in all
scientific fields has been increased because of the fact that the
properties of the material dramatically changes when the size changes
to the nanometer scale. At the initial stages of the peritectic reaction,
smaller-sized RE-211 particles (nanometer-sized) will be utilized
for the peritectic 123 phase formations followed by larger-sized RE-211
grains.19−22 However, the growth reaction/rate could be further improved by geometrical
modifications of precursor RE-211 particles.23−25 This can be
achieved by employing RE-211 particles with very sharp edges and damaged
surfaces. The nanometer-sized, sharp-edged, and surface-damaged RE-211
particles will be consumed during peritectic reaction and so contribute
to improve the growth rate and allow fabricating larger-sized single
domains in shorter times. By this technique, one can produce highly
dense and superior quality final bulk products with embedded and homogenously
distributed fine-sized (nanometer) RE-211 particles in the bulk matrix.
The working mechanism of manipulating the initial RE-211 particle
size and morphology, employing the high-energy ultrasonication method,
is illustrated in Figure 1. 1  

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the irradiation
effect of ultrasonic
energy on RE-211 precursor powders and the final bulk sample microstructure.

2.2 Microstructural Properties
of Precursor Y-211
Powders
The Y-211 particles prepared by the solid-state sintering
method will be of nearly spherical shape and are agglomerated because
of which their size is effectively larger. The micrographs recorded
by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on the Y-211
precursor powders are displayed in Figure 2a,b. The effective size range of the 211
particles was determined to be as large as ∼3–6 μm
because of agglomeration, which is commonly observed in any sintered
powder particles. For demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
method of applying ultrasonic energy and producing sharp-edged and
surface-damaged particles, we have chosen the YBCO system. We manipulated
the initial Y-211 particle size and morphology, employing high-energy
ultrasonication. In order to investigate the effect of power and time
duration on the breaking of the Y-211 particles, different conditions
such as variation of power, duration (Δt),
amount of power and liquid mediums, and so forth were tested.

Figure 2 (a,b) FE-SEM
micrographs of the as-synthesized Y-211 particles.
(c,d) Similar micrographs of Y-211 particles after irradiating ultrasound
with 300 W for 15 min. The agglomerated 211 particles become individual
and submicron-sized on applying ultrasonication.

During the irradiation of low-energy ultrasonic waves and smaller
Δt, sintering bonds between the 211 particles
were broken and became individual. In Figure 2c,d, the FE-SEM images were recorded at magnifications
of 5000× and 20,000×, respectively, illustrating the damage
after irradiation of ultrasonic waves with 300 W power for 15 min.
During this stage, the sintering bonds between the agglomerated Y-211
grains were broken and became individual ones with sizes in the submicron
range. These fine-sized Y-211 particles are believed to participate
and to improve the crystal growth, and remaining fine-sized Y-211
particles will be acting as superior flux pinning centers. A detailed
microstructural analysis of the Y-211 precursor powders pretreated
by the high-energy ultrasonic irradiation was discussed in our recent
work.25 When an ultrasonic power of 300
W was irradiated, the average size range of the Y-211 phase particle
was reduced to about 700 nm. Controlling the size of the initial additives
and the homogenous distribution are the most prominent issues to achieve
flux pinning centers within the 123 matrix, which is the key for enhancing
the Jc up to large applied magnetic fields.

To create more sharp-edged grains and to further modify the surface
morphology, we employed an energy of 300 W at different time intervals
of 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. We found that allowing 300 W for 45 min
was the optimum condition for breaking the Y-211 phase particles while
maintaining high homogeneity. Figure 3 shows the FE-SEM micrographs of (a) 30, (b) 45, and
(c) 60 min ultrasonically pretreated Y-211 particles. All the sample
microstructures reveal that the Y-211 particles are individual, in
which the sintering bonds between the agglomerated Y-211 particles
were successfully divided. However, the morphology of sample Y-211-30
is nearly spherical, and the broken bonds are marked by the blue box
(see Figure 3a), whereas,
the Y-211-45 particles can be found to be differently shaped, that
is, partially eradicated and sharp-edged. It was observed that the
Y-211 phase particles show sharp edges because of bombarding a high
energy of 300 W. The sharp edges produced because of ultrasonic irradiation
were marked with arrows in Figure 3b. The ultrasonic waves were eradicating some part
of the surfaces of Y-211 grains. In some cases, the Y-211 particles
could break up in the middle. The eradication could be achieved in
shorter times if higher ultrasonic powers could be employed. More
importantly, the nanometer Y-211 particles of different morphologies
made by ultrasonic irradiation were expected to participate in a new
type of growth as compared to conventional spherical shape and larger-sized
Y-211 precursor particles. This method also can be employed for creating
such sharp-edged and surface-damaged particles for other types of
materials, by which their reaction or physical properties could be
engineered. As evinced in Figure 3c, when an ultrasonication power of 300 W was employed
for 60 min, the Y-211 particles were damaged immensely because of
which very small-sized flakes can be observed, as marked by the circles.

Figure 3 FE-SEM
images of the Y-211 particles exposed to an ultrasonic energy
of 300 W for (a) 30, (b) 45, and (c) 60 min. The Y-211-45 sample contains
Y-211 particles of different shapes with sharp edges and surface damage
because of partial eradicating surfaces of the material.

As the irradiation time interval Δt increased,
more Y-211 grain surfaces were damaged and the sizes reduced along
with increasing homogeneity. The created sharp edge and surface damages
are believed to improve the peritectic reaction which enhances the
growth rate and distribute the fine-sized nanometer-sized Y-211 particles
homogeneously throughout the bulks. This is supported by reports available
in the literature on other composites.24 The experiments related to investigating the influence of ultrasonically
irradiated Y-211 particles on the growth of various REBCO bulks are
under way.

2.3 Structural Properties of
Ultrasonicated Y-211
Powders and YBCO Bulk Samples
The as-processed Y-211 particles
are agglomerated and are effectively large-sized (∼6 μm)
grains. In order to evince the reduction of the Y-211 particle sizes
with ultrasound irradiation time, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of each pretreated powder were recorded (see Figure 4a). The expanded version of the characteristic
Bragg peak (2θ = 29.6–30°) of Y-211 for all powder
samples is shown in Figure 4b. It can be observed that as Δt increases,
the Bragg peak is widened and the corresponding fwhm value (determined
by fitting with the peak function) increased. The details of the Y-211
size, fwhm, dispersion, and so forth are given in Table 1. This clearly evinces that
the Y-211 particle size decreases with increasing Δt. This result is consistent and gets further support from the microstructural
observations made on the pretreated Y-211 powders.23

energy of 300 W irradiated for different time intervals are compared
to each other. (b) Characteristic Bragg peak of the Y-211 of all powders.

The
as-processed bulk sample photographs of Y–U-0 to Y–U-60
and Y–Pt–CeO2 are shown in Figure 5a,f respectively. The fourfold
facets for the samples clearly indicate that they grew in single-grain
nature.

(a) Y–U-0, (b) Y–U-15, (c) Y–U-30, (d) Y–U-45,
(e) Y–U-60, and (f) Y–Pt–CeO2.

The crystal structure of all bulk YBCO samples
produced by the
pretreated Y-211 and Pt–CeO2 was analyzed from the
XRD patterns and is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that all the Bragg peaks of samples
are highly oriented in the (00l) direction, which
indicates that the bulks are grown in c-axis orientation.
Strong (00l) peaks along with no other (hkl) peaks suggest a high degree of texturing, indicating that all bulks
are entirely a single grain. The prominent reflections show that all
the XRD patterns can be well indexed to a YBCO superconducting phase
with an orthorhombic unit cell. Some of the additional Bragg lines
found in the Y–U-0 sample represent Y-211 as the minor phase
and are marked with the symbol *. No other phases such as Ba–Cu–O
were observed in any of the samples.

2.4 Critical
Temperature
The in-phase
component (real part) of DC magnetic susceptibility (χ) with
a function of temperature for all oxygenated YBCO samples produced
by the ultrasonically pretreated Y-211 and Pt–CeO2 is depicted in Figure 7. A small magnetic field of 1 mT was applied parallel to the c-axis. To clearly see the onset transition of each sample,
the curves are magnified in the inset of Figure 7. The onset of the superconducting transition
for Y–U-0, Y–U-15, Y–U-30, Y–U-45, Y–U-60,
and Y–Pt–CeO2 samples occurs at 90.8, 90.8,
90.2, 91, 90.3, and 90.5 K, respectively. This clearly evidences that
all the samples are exhibiting superconducting nature. The superconducting
transitions in all samples are very sharp, and their transition widths
“ΔTc” of ≤1.1
K indicate the high-quality nature of the samples without any secondary
phases. This result supports the observation of pure phases without
any low-Tc phases in the XRD studies,
as shown in Figure 6. A minor amount of distribution in Tc mainly at the tail of the curves represents the presence of small
amounts of low-Tc phases of oxygen-deficient
phases in the samples which may aid flux pinning. The values of the Tc and ΔTc are
given in Table 2.

2.5 Microstructural Properties
of Bulk YBCO Samples
The fundamental criterion in achieving
high Jc in REBCO superconducting materials
is engineering of the
bulk matrix with fine-sized non-superconducting inclusions. It was
predicted that the effective surface area of these particles is proportional
to the flux pinning of the bulk samples.26 Among, non-superconducting and non-interacting inclusions such as
the 211 phase, particles are considered as effective pinning centers.
The defect density due to the left back 211/123 interfaces will be
of coherence length size and effectively pins the fluxons and aids
in improving the Jc performance of the
single-grain REBCO bulk products.27−30

However, even in the IG
process, great care needs to be taken in dispersing the non-superconducting
particles homogeneously throughout the bulk matrix. The incorporation
of fine-sized Y-211 into the bulk samples depends greatly on the initial
Y-211 conditions. If two differently sized Y-211 phase particles are
employed, it is well known that the smaller-sized particles participate
in the peritectic reactions as the surface energy is large and form
a 123 matrix. The FE-SEM images of Y–U-0, Y–U-15, Y–U-30,
Y–U-45, Y–U-60, and Y–Pt–CeO2 are displayed in Figure 8a–f, respectively. One important observation that can
be made immediately from the microstructural features of all samples
is that the Y-211 particle boundaries are spherical, even though the
initial particles have sharp edges and surface damages. Indeed, this
clearly demonstrates that during peritectic reaction, the sharp-edged
particles were consumed and the Y-211 particles become spherical of
nanometer-size and homogenously distributed throughout the matrix.

Figure 8 FE-SEM
monographs of Y–U-0, Y–U-15, Y–U-30,
Y–U-45, Y–U-60, and Y–Pt–CeO2 samples are shown in (a–f), respectively. The Y-211 grain
sizes are gradually reducing, and the Y–U-45 sample encompassed
a large fraction of nanometer Y-211 phase inclusions dispersed homogeneously.

Even though we added differently sized Y-211 particles
to the samples
Y–U-15, Y–U-30, Y–U-45, and Y–U-60, we
did not observe any traces of solidified liquid phases in the samples
as evinced from the XRD and Tc analysis.
Therefore, it can be stated here that the sharp-edged and surface-damaged
Y-211 particles were completely utilized together with the supplied
LPs for the peritectic growth of the Y-123 matrix.

The Y-211
particles which are of different sizes are employed for
the IG process to enhance the superconducting properties of the final
YBCO bulks. In our previous studies, it was observed that employing
two differently sized Y-211 (micron and nanometer) particles in the
IG process is not suitable.31−33 This is mainly due to the fact
that the nanometer-sized particles of spherical morphology were observed
to close the open gaps (porosity) available between the Y-211 particles
in the preformed pellets. The amount of open porosity in the preformed
pellets is crucial in infiltration of the liquid phases which will
be further utilized during the peritectic reaction. If the open porosity
is abundant, a large amount of liquid will infiltrate; thus, the preformed
pellet will collapse and an inhomogeneous reaction will occur with
left back non-superconducting Ba–Cu–O-rich phases in
the final samples.34 These unwanted phases
will be detrimental to the superconducting properties of the samples.
If, in contrast, the open porosity is too less, then a sufficient
amount of liquids cannot be homogeneously supplied to the preformed
pellets. Therefore, the open porosity available in the preformed pellets
is determined by the applied pressure, and the preformed particle
size is crucial in the growth of the bulk REBCO superconductors.

Another important and different observation made from our previous
work of adding nanometer-sized inclusions in Y-211 for IG processing
is the absence of the enlargement of Y-211 particles in the final
samples. In all our previous studies, we added different nanometer-sized
and spherical-shaped RE sources in the preformed Y-211. The spherical
inclusions were observed to sinter and fuse the gaps between the Y-211
particles in the preformed pellets and limited the infiltration of
the liquid phases. In the present case, even though we added nanometer-
and micron-sized Y-211 phases in the preformed pellets because of
sharp-edged particles sufficient amount of liquid phases were infiltrated
for effective peritectic reaction. Another factor which caused enlargement
of the 211 phase particles in the mixed YBCO/REBCO bulk superconductors
is the growth of mixed RE-211 during the peritectic reaction, which
was grown up to several micron sizes. As discussed in our recent work
of mixed REBCO bulk superconductors, these larger-sized mixed RE-211
particles will be consumed during the peritectic reaction and form
mixed RE-123 unit cells in the final samples.19 However, this case is not valid in the present case of pure YBCO
samples where no other RE elements are involved. Therefore, the sharp-edged
particles were consumed for continuous growth of the matrix leaving
very fine-sized Y-211 particles within the bulk samples.

The
histograms presented in Figure 9a–f give the
distribution of the Y-211 particle size of samples Y–U-0, Y–U-15,
Y–U-30, Y–U-45, Y–U-60, and Y–Pt–CeO2, respectively. The average sizes and volume fractions (Vf211) of the left back Y-211 particles within
the Y-123 matrix for samples Y–U-0, Y–U-15, Y–U-30,
Y–U-45, Y–U-60, and Y–Pt–CeO2 are estimated to be 4 μm (41%), 3 μm (39%), 1.6 μm
(34%), 0.9 μm (32%), ∼0.9 μm (21%), and 1.8 μm
(34%), respectively. The systematic difference in Vf211 and sizes of Y-211 particles within the different
samples clearly shows the difference between the pretreated ones and
the ones without any ultrasonication. Obviously, the Y–U-0
sample contains coarser Y-211 particles because of the larger-sized
and agglomerated precursors. Because of pretreating by increasing
the irradiation time of ultrasonication, the 211 sizes are becoming
finer. This implies that the sharp-edged and surface-damaged Y-211
particles have participated and were consumed effectively in the peritectic
reaction.

Figure 9 Y–U-0, Y–U-15, Y–U-30, Y–U-45, Y–U-60,
and Y–Pt–CeO2 sample histograms of the 211
size distribution are presented in (a)-(f), respectively. As Δt increased, the peak position of the average size of the
Y-211 particles is shifting toward lower values.

The Y–U-45 sample exhibits a higher density of uniformly
dispersed and fine-sized 211 particles within the bulk 123 matrix.
The Y-211 particles left back in Y–U-45 are found to be finer,
and their average is centered on 0.9 μm, whereas those in Y–U-0
are larger, falling in the 4 μm range. The size distribution
of Y-211 precipitates in the case of Y–U-0 is observed to be
much wider in the range 1–8 μm. As the irradiation time
increased, the average size of the Y-211 particles is decreased with
increasing density of submicron-sized Y-211 particles. The density
of smaller-sized particles ≤200 nm is observed to be more in
sample Y–U-45 as compared to other samples, thus indicating
the optimal condition. The Y-211 content is largely decreased in the
case of the Y–U-60 bulk sample because of the increased Y-211
particle dissolving rate in the melt at the growth front. The preformed
Y-211 particles were finer and sharp (see Figure 3c) in the case of sample Y–U-60, which
was mostly utilized in forming the 123 matrix. Therefore, irradiating
an ultrasonic energy of 300 W for 45 min was observed to be optimum
to achieve high homogeneity in dispersion of fine-sized Y-211 particles.
The decrease in the size of the flux pinning inclusions for maintaining
the same optimal volume fraction of Y-211 will increase the flux pinning
strength. The systematic decrease of the Y-211 particle sizes and
content in the final bulks shows the efficiency of the proposed method
in tuning the microstructural properties without any addition of chemical
dopants. As argued from the microstructural features of pretreated
Y-211,25 the reason for fine-sized left
back Y-211 particles in Y–U-45 is attributed to present a sufficient
amount of sharp edges with surface-damaged Y-211 precursor powders.

2.6 Superconducting Properties
2.6.1 Critical
Current Density
To evaluate
the effect of irradiation of ultrasonic energy for different time
intervals on the field dependence of Jc [i.e., Jc(H)] performance at 77 K, M–H loops were recorded up to 5
T field applied normal to the c-axis of each bulk
specimen. The Jc values of all bulk samples
were determined using the extended Bean critical state model.35,36Figure 10 shows
the field dependence of Jc for all the
bulk, YBCO single-grain samples.

Figure 10 Field dependence of Jc curves of all
YBCO samples determined at 77 K.

The zero field Jc [i.e., Jc(0)] for Y–U-0 is found to be 45.1 kA/cm2. As the irradiation time of ultrasonic waves is increased, the Jc values are increased. The Y–U-45 sample
is exhibiting superior Jc performance
with 80.8 kA/cm2 at the self-field. The details of Jc(0) and Jc at 2
T field for all samples are given in Table 2. If the Jc performance
is compared with Y–Pt–CeO2 (62.5 kA/cm2 at 77 K and self-field) also, the Y–U-45 sample is
superior, indicating the effectiveness of the present method. The
analysis of the Jc(H) curves at a lower
field may shed light on the effect of different grain refiners on
the strength of the pinning performances.37,38 Therefore, having a larger number of non-superconducting particles
with fine size is suitable for supporting larger currents. Among all
samples studied here, the density of fine-sized Y-211 particles (≤200
nm) was higher in sample Y–U-45 and supported larger currents
as compared to the other samples. The magnitude of the Jc in the REBCO is determined by the ability of the microstructure
which pins the magnetic flux. This result gets support from the fine-sized
211 phase particles as observed in the superior microstructure of
the Y–U-45 sample.

2.6.2 Trapped Field
The oxygenated bulk
samples are field-cooled by a permanent magnet for 15 min. The 3-D
TF profiles recorded at 1 mm distance (sample surface—Hall
probe) for Y–U-0, Y–U-15, Y–U-30, Y–U-45,
Y–U-60, and Y–Pt–CeO2 single-grain
samples are shown in Figure 11a–f, respectively. The single conical curves without
any distortion for all the samples indicate that all the samples are
grown as single grains and the complete bulk is oxygenated. The observed
TF values at 0.3 mm (TFsurface) and 1 mm (TF1mm) for all the samples are given in Table 2. It is obvious from Table 2 that the TF performance is gradually improved
with irradiation of ultrasound energy duration, and a maximum TFsurface value of 0.48 T was recorded for the sample Y–U-60.
This value is nearly two times that of sample Y–U-0. The gradual
increase in the TF performance can be attributed to the improved pinning
performance because of the employment of fine-sized 211 phase particles.

Figure 11 TF profiles
of Y–U-0, Y–U-15, Y–U-30, Y–U-45,
Y–U-60, and Y–Pt–CeO2 single grains
containing different Y-211 particle sizes are shown in panels (a–f),
respectively. All TF data are recorded at 77 K by cooling in the field
of a permanent magnet (surface field of 0.5 T).

The Jc performance of sample Y–U-45
is superior compared to sample Y–U-60. As demonstrated from
microstructural features of both samples, it relates to the density
and the size of the Y-211 particles left back in the samples. The
density of nanometer-sized Y-211 particles (≤200–500
nm) is high in the case of the Y–U-45 sample, and the dispersion
of the Y-211 grains is also uniform which supports the higher magnitude
of Jc values (Figure 12). From microstructural observations, it
is evident that even though the Y-211 particle sizes are smaller for
Y–U-60, the lower Vf211 limits
the Jc performance. However, here, we
point out that the TF reflects the global Jc of the complete bulk sample. However, the Jc determined on a small subspecimen with a limited microstructure
is sensitive to many parameters such as defects or fluctuations. Therefore,
the Jc of Y–U-60 might be inferior
to that of Y–U-45. To make a conclusive statement, however,
we need a detailed growth and microstructure-related investigation
which we will be carried out subsequently. The present results may
be even improved by employing higher ultrasonic powers, which will
also lead to reduction of the time interval, thus efficiently producing
the sharp-edged 211 preformed particles and without chemically doping.

Figure 12 Jc (0 T) and TFsurface values
at 77 K are compared as a function of ultrasonic irradiation time.

In order to further validate the results obtained
from sample Y–U-60,
we synthesized a new single-grain YBCO bulk sample (Y–U-60-Rpt)
with 60 min ultrasonicated Y-211 powders by the TS-IG method. The
microstructures of Y–U-45, Y–U-60, and Y–U-60-Rpt
samples are displayed in Figure 13a–c, respectively. The comparison of the microstructures
of samples Y–U-60 and Y–U-60-Rpt clearly depicts that
both the samples show similar features with the low 211 content and
dispersion. The microstructural features indicating that a large amount
of fine-sized and sharp-edged Y-211 powders produced by ultrasonication
for 60 min were utilized for fabricating the bulk single-grain YBCO
sample. Because of this, the field dependence Jc curves determined at 77 K of Y–U-60 and Y–U-60-Rpt,
as shown in Figure 14, exhibit a similar trend. The TF at 77 K for Y–U-60-Rpt was
measured to be 0.38 and 0.45 T at the 1 and 0.3 mm distance from the
sample surface, respectively, whereas these values for the Y–U-60
sample are 0.41 and 0.48 T, respectively. The 3-D TF profiles of Y–U-60
and Y–U-60-Rpt are given in (a,b), respectively, of Figure 14 as insets. These
results clearly imply that the produced samples have similar properties
which strongly support the novel approach as the samples could be
successfully reproduced. Also, this further supports the different
reactivity of the ultrasonicated Y-211 in the bulk REBCO growth, which
needs to be studied further.

and (c)

pretreated by ultrasonication for 60 min are analogous.

The insets of (a,b) represent the 3-D TF profiles of Y–U-60
and Y–U-60-Rpt samples, respectively, recorded at 77 K and
1 mm distance from the sample surface. Both the Jc and TF measurements are nearly similar for both the
samples.

2.7 Future
Perspectives
As demonstrated,
the proposed novel method is advantageous and superior to any of the
available methods. More importantly, this method is general by which
the sharp-edged rough surface 211 particles could be employed for
any methods such as MG and IG. The effectivity of the present method
can be further improved to develop the REBCO material as a candidate
for various practical applications. The future perspectives for further
investigation of the effect of ultrasonication on the REBCO superconductors
are discussed below.1. Precursor powders of different 123
and 211 phase powders synthesized via different methods such as solid
state and chemical routes and test the ultrasonic effect. Utilizing
the 123 and 211 phase particles with sharp-edged and damaged surfaces,
synthesize the bulk samples via MG and IG processes. Ultrasonically
pretreated 123/211 powders could be employed in fabricating other
forms of superconducting materials such as thin films, tapes, thick
films, cables, foams,39 and so forth.

2. Testing of high ultrasonic
powers (≥300
W) for quickly producing the pretreated various 211/123 phases for
constructing high-performance REBCO bulk products.

3. Producing different sized 211/123 phases
and mixing them as micron-sized particles, and studying the effects
on the growth of the bulks and their final physical properties.

4. Using the pretreated initial
211 particles
to study the growth and reaction in IG/MG processing of REBCO superconductors.
This study may help in growing larger-sized bulk single grains in
shorter durations.

5. Pretreat
different REBCO phases and
construct mixed REBCO bulk superconductors.

6. Batch processing of various YBCO/REBCO
superconductors with ultrasonicated 211/123 phase particles.



3 Conclusions
We propose
a novel, reliable, and cost-effective method, which
controls and reduces the 211 particles size in precursor powder and
then subsequently produces nanometer-sized 211 precipitates. The initial
Y-211 particle size and morphology were manipulated employing high-energy
ultrasonication for producing sharp-edged and surface-damaged Y-211
preformed powders. To demonstrate the effectivity of the method, bulk
single-grain YBCO superconductors of high quality were fabricated
by the TS-IG method and compared with the addition of grain refining
agents of Pt–CeO2. As the time duration was increased,
the Y-211 size was decreased and sharp-edged and different-shaped
Y-211 particles were created. The effectiveness of the present method
lies in the tuning of the initial Y-211 particle size, morphologies,
and the grain boundary volume fraction in the final bulk YBCO samples.
With increasing irradiation time, the 211 particle size and Vf211 in the final bulk samples were decreased.
The TF performance of bulk single-grain YBCO samples exhibited a systematic
improvement with the increase of irradiation time. The YBCO sample
fabricated using Y-211 particles with ultrasonic irradiation for 60
min was able to trap a magnetic field of ∼0.48 T at 77 K. Jc (at 77 K) was increased monotonically for
ultrasonic irradiation time of up to 45 min. A further increase of
Δt led to a decrease of Jc because of lower interfacial defect density. The method presented
will enable even in MG-processed composites to homogeneously disperse
the 211 secondary phase particles in the bulk REBCO body.

4 Experimental Details
Precursor powders of the Y-211 and
liquid phase (LP = Er-123 and
Ba3Cu5O8) were synthesized employing
highly pure Y2O3, BaO2, and CuO raw
materials via the solid-state sintering method. To assure single-phase
formation of Y-211 and Er-123, the sintering process was carried out
at 860, 880, and 900 °C for 4 h at each temperature. After each
sintering, the powder was mechanically ground for 2 h for mixing the
compounds employing an auto mortar grinder (Nitto Kagaku, model ANM-1000).
For reducing the size and damaging the surface of the Y-211 particles,
we employed a high-energy ultrasonic processor (MITSUI, model UX-300).
This ultrasonic processor allows operation in two modes: (i) continuous
and (ii) pulse. We employed both modes to compare the effect on reducing
the size of the Y-211 particles. We observed that the Y-211 particles
were effectively reducing their size operating the “pulse”
mode. For this reason, we experimented by changing the energy of the
ultrasonic probe from 100 to 300 W. It was observed that applying
the ultrasound radiation with 300 W was effective. Then, to further
optimize and control the Y-211 particle size and morphology, the irradiation
time intervals (Δt) of 15, 30, 45, and 60 min
were employed. Ethanol was used as an aqueous medium for all present
ultrasonication experiments. Ultrasonically treated Y-211 powders
were heat-treated at 400–600 °C for 12 h to eliminate
the carbon-related compounds in the Y-211 powders. Utilizing the 15,
30, 45, and 60 min ultrasonically treated Y-211 precursor powders,
we successfully grew YBCO bulk single grains via the TS-IG method.
The Y-211 powders pretreated with 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of ultrasonication
are referred to as Y-211-0, Y-211-15, Y-211-30, Y-211-45, and Y-211-60,
respectively.

The preformed pellets of Y-211 and LP sources
of 20 mm diameter
were made by applying a uniaxial pressure of 420 MPa.19 A box furnace calibrated over a wide range of temperatures
was employed for the YBCO bulk sample growth. The temperature profile
recorded over the calibrated temperature range indicated a uniform
thermal gradient. To fabricate a well-defined orientation of the single-grain
YBCO bulk superconductors, a single crystalline NdBCO bulk was used
as a seed. The time–temperature schedule followed for fabricating
the YBCO bulks was designed as follows: The sample assembly was heated
to 820 °C in 5 h and for improving the strength of the Y-211,
a 1 h dwell was allowed. Then, the temperature was increased to 1060
°C (Ti) with a heating
rate of 4 °C/min, and for homogeneous infiltration of liquid
phases, a 1 h dwell was given. The temperature from Ti was cooled to 1005 °C (peritectic temperature “Tp”) in 30 min. To initiate the crystal
growth and for growing the single grain of YBCO, a slow cooling of
100 h (0.25 °C/h) was facilitated from the Tp to 980 °C. Then, the furnace was allowed to cool
naturally.

The YBCO bulk single grains fabricated with different
time intervals
(Δt) of the Y-211 ultrasound treatment of 0,
15, 30, 45, and 60 min are referred to as Y–U-0, Y–U-15,
Y–U-30, Y–U-45, and Y–U-60, respectively. To
corroborate the developed ultrasonic method, one more YBCO bulk single
grain was fabricated with the addition of 0.25 wt % of Pt and 0.25
wt % of CeO2 and is referred to as Y–Pt–CeO2. Finally, all the samples were oxygenated at 450–400
°C for 250 h with a constant oxygen flow of 0.3 L/min and an
additional 100 h for M–H measurements.
It is also interesting to mention here that recently, Takanori Motoki
and Jun-ichi Shimoyama group have proposed a novel method for reducing
the prolonged oxygenation annealing process employing the oxygen-containing
water vapor.40 The YBCO bulks exhibit the
typical spatial inhomogeneities and hence, their physical properties
vary with position in the sample.41,42 Keeping this
in mind, in order to overcome the spatial dependence, the specimen
(∼0.5 × 1.5 × 2 mm3) intended for the
magnetic measurements from each sample was collected ∼2 mm
below the seed.

Investigation of the microstructural properties
was carried out
by FE-SEM, JEOL model JSM-7100F. The structural properties of the
pretreated Y-211 particles and of the final bulk YBCO samples were
examined by the XRD technique. TF measurements were performed in liquid
nitrogen (77 K) with a Hall probe and field cooling in a 0.5 T field
provided by a permanent magnet. The superconducting transition temperature
and field-dependence critical current densities of the samples were
characterized with the superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID, Quantum design, model MPMS-XL5). Characterization details
of various physical properties of the samples can be found in our
previous studies.43−45
