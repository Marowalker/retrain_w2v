Polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP)-assisted nanocatalyst preparation was
succeeded by employing a controlled solvothermal route to produce
efficient electrodes for electrochemical water-splitting applications.
Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts have
been confirmed through the strong signature of (113) and (111) crystal
planes, respectively. The binding natures of Bi–W–O
and Fe–W–O have been thoroughly discussed by employing
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy which confirmed the formation of
Bi2WO6 and FeWO4. The freestanding
nanoplate array morphology of Bi2WO6 and the
fine nanosphere particle morphology of FeWO4 nanocatalysts
were revealed by scanning electron microscopy images. With these confirmations,
the fabrication of durable, long-term electrodes for electrochemical
water splitting has been subjected to efficient oxidation of water,
confirmed by obtaining 2.79 and 1.96 mA/g for 0.5 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts, respectively.
The water oxidation mechanism of both nanocatalysts has been revealed
with the support of 24 h stability test over continuous water oxidation
and faster charge transfer achieved by the smaller Tafel slope values
of 75 and 78 mV/dec, respectively. Generally, these nanocatalysts
are utilized for photocatalytic applications. The present study revealed
the PVP-assisted synthesis to produce electrocatalytically active
nanocatalysts and their electrochemical water-splitting mechanism
which will offer a pathway for research interests with regard to the
production of multifunctional nanocatalysts for both electro- and
photocatalytic applications in the near future.

1 Introduction
For the past few decades,
hasty developments of smart electronic,
hybrid energy conversion and storage devices have ruled the mankind.
Energy conversion and storage have gained interest among researchers,
which turned their focus towards producing sustainable clean energy
as the replacement of traditional fossil fuels. Among other approaches,
electrochemical water splitting is one of the best methods. It is
cost-effective, cheap, efficient, and ecofriendly.1−3 Water electrolysis
by electrocatalysts through electrochemical water splitting will give
promising output for pure and sustainable energy applications.4,5 Precious metals such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir),
and so forth have shown almost benchmark results of energy storage
applications. However, the limitations of such precious metals are
high cost and low availability.6−8 Hence, low-cost, highly stable,
and efficient electrodes are still being developed by researchers
as alternates for such noble metals. Therefore, tungsten as an earth-abundant
and low-cost material is used as an efficient catalyst; moreover,
tungsten-based materials are the most important energy materials of
inorganic family used for potential applications.9,10 Recently,
studies have revealed that Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 are excellent functional materials because of their unique
electronic structures. There have been many attempts to study the
use of these materials as electrodes for photocatalytic and supercapacitor
applications, wherein the tungsten-based nanocomposites are reported
as photoanodes and photocatalysts,11,12 symmetric
and asymmetric electrodes,13 and so forth.
Very few research activities have been initiated to study the electrochemical
water-splitting applications of tungstates.14−18 Further, the morphological variations and compactness,
more number of active sites, low overpotential, high electrochemical
stability, and fast charge transportation mechanism of these electrocatalysts
are the significant features for the efficient electrolysis of water.19,20 Hence, nanocatalyst preparation with a diverse morphology assisted
by surfactants is a promising approach to tune the material properties,
achieved by the research society nowadays. Among other surfactants,
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) played a selective role in nanomaterial
synthesis. PVP is a nonionic, nontoxic polymer with a large number
of polar amide groups within the pyrrolidone ring.21,22 These groups in PVP make it a successful stabilizer, disperser,
and growth controller. Hence, PVP has been chosen to control the particle
growth and provide a stable chemical environment for the nanocatalyst
preparation. Moreover, many research activities have been attempted
by using tungstate nanomaterials with carbon-based composites for
energy applications.23−25

In the present study, the preparation of electrochemically
active
multifunctional carbon-free nanocatalysts using a PVP capping agent
that acted as a stabilizer and growth-controlling agent has been reported.
The successful synthesis of Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts has been confirmed by various fundamental characterization
techniques, and an appreciable electrochemical outcome of water oxidation
has been reported. The electrochemical water electrolysis mechanism
by tungstates has been reported in this study. Within the best of
our knowledge, no research activities have reported on carbon-free
nanocatalysts such as Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 synthesized by the PVP-assisted solvothermal optimization growth
technique for electrochemical water-splitting applications. The ultimate
aim of this work is to produce multifunctional nanocatalysts for both
electro- and photocatalytic applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
Multifunctional nanocatalysts such as Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 synthesized via a solvothermal
route assisted
by the PVP capping agent have been extensively investigated by X-ray
diffraction (XRD), as shown in Figure 1a–f. The structural properties and crystalline
nature of the prepared nanocatalysts are thoroughly discussed through
the highly resolved diffraction peaks centered at 2θ values
at 28.3, 32.8, 47.2, 55.8, 58.6, 69.1, 76.1, and 78.5° relevant
to the crystalline planes of (113), (200), (220), (313), (226), (040),
(333), and (046), respectively, for Bi2WO6.
On the other hand, for FeWO4, the 2θ values observed
at 15.5, 18.8, 23.8, 24.4, 30.4, 36.3, 38.0, 41.2, 44.2, 48.7, 51.6,
52.6, 53.7, 61.6, 65.2, 70.9, and 73.0° are relevant to the crystalline
planes of (010), (100), (011), (110), (111), (021), (200), (121),
(112), (022), (120), (122), (221), (113), (023), (321), and (312),
respectively. The JCPDS data numbers #73-2020 and #74-1130 concurrently
matched with the orthorhombic Bi2WO6 and monoclinic
FeWO4, respectively. The strong signature of the diffraction
peaks revealed the good crystalline nature of the nanocatalysts. As
compared to Bi2WO6, FeWO4 nanocatalysts
exhibited a slight amorphous nature. No other significant peaks were
predicted except for the characteristic peaks of the prepared nanocatalysts,
which provided good correlation with the single-phase bimetal oxide
nanocatalysts reported by previous studies.26,27 The role of PVP as a capping agent could not be appreciably noticed
in the diffraction peak shift or any other changes in the diffraction
peaks of the samples. However, the variation in the crystallite sizes
with the addition of different concentrations of the PVP capping agent
was revealed by the Debye–Scherrer formula, D = 0.9λ/β cos θ, where λ, β, and θ
are attributed to the wavelength of X-ray, full width at half-maximum
intensity, and Bragg’s angle, respectively. The calculated
crystallite sizes of the samples are 33.32, 23.80, 27.77, 27.92, 23.91,
and 23.94 nm for bare Bi2WO6, 0.5 g PVP-assisted
Bi2WO6, 1 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6, bare FeWO4, 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4, and 1 g PVP-assisted FeWO4, respectively. It can be
visibly seen that the smallest crystallite size is obtained for the
optimum concentration of 0.5 g of the PVP capping agent for both the
nanocatalysis, which may be due to the controlled nucleation of particle
growth provided by the optimum PVP level in synthesis. Hence, the
XRD spectra confirmed the formation of Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts.

PVP-assisted Bi2WO6, (c) 1 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6, (d) bare FeWO4, (e) 0.5 g PVP-assisted
FeWO4, and (f) 1 g PVP-assisted FeWO4.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the synthesized nanocatalysts
are displayed in Figures 2 and 3 in different scale ranges. Generally,
using polymers in nanomaterial synthesis is a traditional way of controlling
the growth kinetics, which can change the reaction environment and
can support the solubility rate of the precursor materials.28 The present study reported the synthesis of
PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts
by means of the surface morphology and modifications with respect
to the concentration of the capping agent (PVP). The formation mechanism
of the Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts
with respect to the PVP concentration has been revealed. Figure 2a,d displays the
agglomerated clumsy nanocluster-like flake morphology of bare Bi2WO6. In the case of the Bi2WO6 nanoplate array synthesis, the actual surface morphology of bare
Bi2WO6 was clumsy with aggregated nanocluster-like
flakes, as shown in Figure 2a,d in 2 μm and 200 nm scale ranges. The addition of
0.5 g PVP stabilized the reaction environment and supported the completion
of nanoflakes as nanoplates with organized freestanding ability. Further,
it reduced the aggregation of nanoplates by forming a capping layer
around the nucleus which controls the particle growth. Moreover, it
performed a crucial role as a dispersant at the optimum concentration,
which resulted in dispersed, ordered, and freestanding nanoplate arrays
as shown in Figure 2b,e. Moreover, increasing the concentration of PVP from 0.5 to 1
g provided aggregation and distortion in a well-aligned nanoplate
morphology. Further, the particle size also seems to be decreased
with larger agglomeration as shown in Figure 2c,f, which may be due to the excess amount
of PVP that failed to cover the entire surface of the nuclei, promoting
the nucleation rate, which resulted in the distorted nanoplates with
higher agglomeration.29 This implies that
a well-defined plate-like morphology with good dispersion was obtained
at an optimum concentration of the capping agent. Similarly, PVP-assisted
FeWO4 nanosphere synthesis evidenced the optimum concentration
of 0.5 g of PVP abundantly reducing the self-aggregation of nanoparticles
and providing less agglomeration.

a 200 nm scale range.

scale range, (d) bare FeWO4, (e) 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4, and (f) 1 g PVP-assisted FeWO4 in 1 μm
scale range.

Figure 3a–f
demonstrates the surface morphology of FeWO4 nanocatalysts
in the scale ranges of 2 and 1 μm. The SEM images clearly revealed
the nanosphere surface morphology of the nanocatalysts with some agglomeration.
The overall agglomeration of the nanocatalysts is due to the interaction
between the magnetic nanoparticles and the calcination treatment effect.30Figure 3a,d represents the highly agglomerated nanosphere formation. Figure 3b,e shows the drastic
reduction in agglomeration of the nanocatalysts synthesized with the
use of 0.5 g of the PVP capping agent with the precursor solution.
In this case, PVP acts as an effective stabilizer and a dispersive
agent of nanomaterial synthesis. Further, a higher concentration of
PVP led to aggregation of particles, which may be because of the same
effect of a rapid nucleation rate (Figure 3c,f).29 The particle
sizes show resemblance in all the samples, but the agglomeration completely
depends on the concentration of the capping agent. The SEM images
of the FW2 and FW3 nanocatalysts show almost similar morphology, but
the aggregation of the FW3 nanocatalysts is higher than that of FW2.
This may be due to the rapid nucleation rate of synthesis. Therefore,
more metal ions interact with PVP and the growth kinetics are reasonably
controlled, which produce finer nanoparticles, resulting in more aggregation
of particles.31 Further, the mechanism
of PVP is supporting the nanoparticle synthesis which was highly emphasized
the growth kinetics and the concentration of PVP is also an important
role in deciding the dispersive nature of nanostructures. Hence, it
is evidenced that the capping agent played a crucial role in deciding
the particle shape, size, and distribution in nanomaterial synthesis.

As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the final morphology of a material
is obtained after the calcination process at 400 °C for 2 h.
Further, the purpose of PVP used in the reaction is to form fine nanostructures
with a controlled morphology. Calcination was done after the completion
of the whole synthesis procedure. Therefore, the calcination temperature
did not have any effect on PVP during synthesis, rather it had an
influence during the calcination process. PVP was used as a stabilizer
in our work, and its influence was investigated on the morphological
properties of the synthesized nanostructures by SEM, which showed
that PVP stabilized the metallic ions with its amide group. During
the drying process (at 80 °C), the long-chain polymers of PVP
were decomposed to short-chain polymers. During the calcination process
(at 400 °C), the PVP content and other impurities were completely
removed from the material.32 Hence, the
calcination temperature made an influence and effect on PVP during
the calcination process.

The Raman spectra of the prepared nanocatalysts
have been displayed
in Figure 4A,B. Figure 4A(a–c) represents
the well-determined characteristic peaks of Bi2WO6 centered at 296, 412, 473, 714, and 794 cm–1.
It shows the predominant peak at 794 cm–1, which
is attributed to the symmetric stretching mode of the vibrations of
WO6 octahedra because of the apical oxygen atom perpendicular
to the layer.33 The small intense peak
observed at 714 cm–1 is attributed to the asymmetric
stretching mode of WO6 octahedra, mainly because of the
equatorial oxygen atoms vibrating inside the layer. The second strong
peak at 296 cm–1 is attributed to the bending mode
of the bismuth–oxygen polyhedral.34 Other small intense peaks around 412 and 473 cm–1 are the characteristic vibration modes of the orthorhombic Bi2WO6 nanoplate arrays. Figure 4B(a–c) represents the characteristic
peaks of the FeWO4 nanocatalysts centered at 272, 357,
479, 607, 730, 823, and 856 cm–1 respectively. The
peaks at 823 and 856 cm–1 correspond to the Ag symmetric mode of terminal WO2.35 The peak around 730 cm–1 corresponds
to the asymmetric stretching mode of vibration. The peaks at 272,
357, and 479 cm–1 correspond to the vibration modes
of tungsten anions.36 Hence, the confirmation
of monoclinic FeWO4 nanospheres is further evidenced by
Raman spectra.

The photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of the prepared nanocatalysts
are displayed in Figure 5a–f. The peaks are obtained for the given excitation wavelength
of 320 nm. Three defined peaks were observed for both the samples
at 492, 505, and 522 nm. The obtained PL spectra of these emissions
revealed the good charge transfer and oxygen vacancies present in
the samples. The strong predominant peak centered at 492 nm could
be attributed to the intrinsic luminescent behavior of the Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts.37 The other peaks at 505 and 522 nm purely depend
on the higher oxygen vacancies present in the samples, which revealed
that the more number of oxygen vacancies encountered by the nanocatalysts
provided very good electrocatalytic response over higher electronic
conductivity.19,38

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy has been carried
out for the samples in the wavenumber range 500–4000 cm–1. Figure 6a–c displays the FTIR spectra of the Bi2WO6 nanoplate array catalysts. The band at 561 cm–1 confirms the Bi–O stretching vibration mode,
the band at 736 cm–1 corresponds to the W–O
stretching vibration, and the band at 821 cm–1 corresponds
to the W–O–W bridging mode of the Bi2WO6 nanocatalyst.39,40Figure 6d–f displays the FTIR spectra of the
FeWO4 nanosphere electrocatalyst. The band observed at
555 cm–1 corresponds to the Fe–O stretching
vibration, and the band at 763 cm–1 corresponds
to the W–O lattice vibration.41 The
other bands observed for all nanocatalysts around 1635, 2352, 2927,
and 3452 cm–1 correspond to the O–H bending,
CO2 vibration, C–H symmetric stretching, and O–H
stretching vibration modes, respectively. Further, the appreciable
variation observed in the FTIR spectra, especially in the 500–1000
cm–1 range, for BW3 compared to bare may be due
to the particle size effect.42 This demonstrated
that the lower wavenumber shift observed in addition to the variation
in the FTIR profile in the range 500–1000 cm–1 may be due to the aggregation of particles and variation in their
sizes.43 Further, more concentration of
PVP affected the crystal structure by the distortion in the lattice
during the nucleation process itself which resulted in the suppression
of signals in the BW3 and FW3 samples in the FTIR spectra.44

The UV–DRS spectra have
been displayed in Figure 7A(a–f). The absorption
edge of the samples was clearly obtained from the graph. It shows
the clear absorption edge around 450 nm for the Bi2WO6 nanoplate arrays and 700 nm for FeWO4 nanospheres.
These results absolutely coincided with that of the literature.45,46 Further, the band gaps of the prepared nanocatalysts have been estimated
by the Tauc graph (Figure 7B) using the formula: αhν = A(hν – Eg)n, where α, h, A, and Eg denote the
absorption coefficient, incident photon energy, constant, and band
gap energy, respectively. As per the Tauc plot, the band gap values
of the prepared nanocatalysts are predicted as 2.8 eV for the Bi2WO6 nanoplate arrays and 2.1 eV for the FeWO4 nanospheres, respectively. There is no appreciable change
observed in the band gap structure of the nanocatalysts with respect
to the capping agent concentration. Hence, it is explored that the
influence of the capping agents could be verified in the application
studies.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra
of Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts
have been depicted
in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. An XPS study was carried out to
investigate the chemical composition and valence state of the prepared
nanocatalysts. It is a valid experiment to confirm the phase purity
of the samples. In the present study, the composition analysis was
carried out only for the best-performed optimized nanocatalysts prepared
by 0.5 g of PVP-supported solvothermal synthesis. Figures 8 and 9 represent that the peaks obtained at certain binding energies are
the characteristic peaks of the corresponding nanocatalysts. Figure 8a illustrates the
survey spectrum of the Bi2WO6 nanoplate arrays
that consist of Bi, W, and O elements and some carbon trace. The presence
of carbon may be due to the usage of a carbon tape during the XPS
analysis. Figure 8b
represents the spin–orbit components of Bi 4f by two strong
peaks observed at 164.7 and 159.4 eV, attributed to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states of the Bi3+ crystal structure,
respectively. Figure 8c represents the W6+ crystal structure of the Bi2WO6 nanocatalyst by two strong peaks at 35.6 and 38.1
eV, attributed to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states,
respectively. Figure 8c represents the presence of an oxygen element by the sharp strong
peak at 530.2 eV. Further, the inhomogeneous nature of the O 1s spectrum
observed for the Bi2WO6 nanocatalyst may be
due to the presence of oxygen in the nanocatalyst existing in the
form of a hydroxyl oxygen state on the surface.47 Hence, the chemical environment and chemical states of
the impurity-free Bi2WO6 nanocatalyst has been
confirmed by the XPS analysis.

Figure 9a represents
the survey spectrum of FeWO4 nanospheres. It consists of
the presence of elements such as Fe, W, and O in the FeWO4 nanocatalyst. This spectrum also consists of some carbon traces
which may be due to the carbon present in the instrument itself. Figure 9b represents the
presence of the Fe element confirmed by two peaks at 710.8 and 724.7
eV that could be attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states of Fe in the FeWO4 nanocatalyst. Figure 9c represents the W4f state of the W element confirmed by two peaks obtained at 35.4 and
37.6 eV attributed to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states,
respectively.48Figure 9d represents the presence of oxygen species
at 530.3 eV and also the small hump-like peak observed at 532–533
eV which could be attributed to the presence of hydroxyl radicals
on the surface of the nanocatalyst.49 Hence,
the XPS spectra confirm the formation of good-quality FeWO4 nanocatalyst.

Figure 10 demonstrates
the specific surface area analysis of the best-performed 0.5 g PVP-assisted
Bi2WO6 and 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4 nanocatalysts. From the studies, obviously, a higher surface area
is exhibited by the Bi2WO6 nanoplates than FeWO4. The relevant Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
analysis revealed the pore size, pore volume, and surface area, as
depicted in Table 1. From Table 1, it
is clear that 0.5 g of PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 possessed
a surface area of 31.92 m2/g, which is 4 times greater
than that of FeWO4 nanospheres, which may be due to the
distribution of well-aligned, nanosized plates with less agglomeration
which will facilitate faster ionic transfer and more number of active
sites during the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
According to the pore size and volume of the nanoplates and nanospheres,
it is exploited that both the nanostructures exhibited a microporous
nature that also favors the electrochemical OER activity of the electrode.

Figure 11A,B represents
the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) graph of the nanocatalysts prepared
in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The potential
window has been fixed from −0.2 to 0.6 V in which Hg/HgO has
been used as the reference electrode. The potential has been converted
into a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In general, the water
electrolysis process needs 1.23 V versus the RHE potential to start
OER. In our case, Figure 11A,B shows the good OER response of the fabricated working
electrodes of the prepared nanocatalysts. The LSV graph represents
that the drastic change in the current density values observed for
different candidates is purely dependent on the morphology of the
nanocatalysts. In general, the electrocatalysts require more number
of active sites to be available in the electrode/electrolyte region,
lower overpotential, and good electrochemical stability. All these
features make the electrocatalysts to perform efficient water electrolysis.
Further, the influence of morphology-dependent electrochemical activity
tuned by the PVP capping agent and the electrochemical mechanism of
Bi and Fe tungstates based on their morphologies has been explored
in our work as follows. The current densities observed from the LSV
graph in Figure 11A(a–c) are 0.18, 2.79, and 1.06 mA/g for bare Bi2WO6, 0.5 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6,
and 1 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts, respectively.
The highest current density achieved for the 0.5 g PVP-assisted synthesis
of Bi2WO6 nanocatalyst may be due to the well-defined
nanoplate array morphology of the electrode which facilitated more
number of active sites for enhancing the electrochemical reaction.
The optimized concentration of the capping agent provided a suitable
environment for well-dispersed, completely full filled growth kinetics
of nanoplate arrays which results in the overall defined morphology
of the nanocatalyst. Further, the bare Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts possessed very low current densities, denoting very
low efficiency toward electrolyzing the water. These clumsy nanostructures
may be aggregated more during the electrochemical reaction in the
electrode/electrolyte region which reduces the number of active sites
on the surface of the working electrode. The same may happen for the
1 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts because
of the agglomerated nanoplate array morphology. Further, the lower
overpotential of 210 mV was successfully achieved for our optimized
nanocatalysts. This is the lowest overpotential achieved for the Bi2WO6 nanocatalyst in the field of electrochemical
water oxidation within our knowledge. However, the current density
indicating the OER response of our optimized nanocatalyst is lower
than the values reported in other literatures9,10 for
different electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the moderate current density
value with a lower overpotential for Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts
in the electrochemical water-splitting reaction is quite a novel result. Figure 11B(a–c) represents
the electrochemical water-splitting behavior of FeWO4 nanocatalysts
synthesized in different chemical environments with and without the
PVP capping agent. The current density observed for the nanocatalysts
are 0.71, 1.96, and 1.27 mA/g for bare FeWO4, 0.5 g PVP-assisted
FeWO4, and 1 g PVP-assisted FeWO4, respectively.
In case of FeWO4 nanosphere electrocatalysts, there is
not much difference in the morphology observed, but the dispersive
nature and agglomeration of the nanocatalysts played a crucial role
in the water electrolysis process during the electrochemical reaction.
The optimized FeWO4 nanocatalysts synthesized with 0.5
g of PVP possessed good current density with an overpotential of 320
mV among other FeWO4 samples, which may be due to the lesser
agglomeration of particles that provided more active sites that enhanced
the conductivity of the working electrode, which resulted in the good
OER activity of the optimized electrode. Further, the variation in
current densities in the range of 1.0–1.1 V in the LSV profiles
of PVP-assisted FeWO4 and bare FeWO4 may be
due to the initiation of some hydrogen evolution reaction of the bare
and optimum PVP-assisted electrodes during the electrochemical water
oxidation process. It may be due to the favorable band gap and suitable
morphology of the FeWO4 (FW1 and FW2) electrodes. The focus
of our study is to investigate the extensive OER activity of the fabricated
electrode. Therefore, the initiation of the HER activity was not concerned.
Hence, optimized nanocatalysts synthesized using the capping agent
supported the enhanced electrochemical response toward efficient oxidation
of water because of their compact, well-defined, and dispersed morphologies.

Figure 11C(a–c)
illustrates the EIS spectra of the Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts,
which consist of three regions such as the solution resistance (Rs) region, charge-transfer resistance (Rct-semicircle) region, and Warburg’s
conductive (spike) region. The EIS graph clearly demonstrates the
exact semicircle region for the three electrodes, but the variations
in the semicircle and spike regions denote the different conductivities
possessed by different electrocatalysts which suggested that the drastic
changes observed in LSV depend on the morphology and conductivity
of the prepared nanocatalysts. The charge-transfer resistances of
the bare, 0.5 g PVP-, and 1 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts are 0.030, 0.014, and 0.016 Ω, respectively.
Hence, it proved that the optimized nanocatalyst is governed by very
low charge-transfer resistance which undoubtedly increases the charge
transfer. Moreover, the ions gained a higher mobility, thereby enhancing
the electrochemical OER activity of the optimized electrode. Figure 11D(a–c) represents
the EIS spectra of FeWO4 nanocatalysts. The charge-transfer
resistances of the bare, 0.5 g PVP-, and 1 g PVP-assisted FeWO4 nanocatalysts are 0.036, 0.016, and 0.027 Ω, respectively.
In this case, the optimized electrode possessed lower Rct values which improved the charge-transfer mechanism
of the candidate that strongly supported the efficient OER activity.
Hence, the EIS spectra provided a strong relevance to the LSV spectra
by means of promoting the mobility of charge carriers, assisted by
the optimum concentration of the capping agent-supported nanocatalysts,
for an efficient electrochemical water oxidation process.

Figure 12A,B represents
the Tafel slope of the prepared nanocatalysts. Tafel slope is an efficient
way to evaluate the electrodes and its catalytic activity toward proficient
oxidation of water. It displayed the graph between the potential and
log(j). Figure 12A,B represents clearly that the electrocatalytic activity
of the optimized electrodes prepared by 0.5 g of PVP-supported synthesis
played a noteworthy role in the electrochemical water oxidation process.
Based on Tafel plot, the slope values obtained are 119, 75, 98, 151,
78, and 107 mV/dec for bare Bi2WO6, 0.5 g PVP-assisted
Bi2WO6, 1 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6, bare FeWO4, 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4, and 1 g PVP-assisted FeWO4, respectively. The smallest
Tafel slope value denoted the fast charge-transfer kinetics and outstanding
electronic conductivity of the optimized nanocatalyst.50 It may be due to the well-dispersed, less agglomerated,
defined morphology of the nanocatalyst providing more active sites
for the successful electrochemical reaction to enhance the OER activity
of the electrode.

performed 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4.

A CA test for the optimized nanocatalysts was carried out
for 24
h to evaluate the durability of the electrode materials. Figure 12C shows the stability
test for 24 h on 0.5 g PVP-supported Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts
which long-lasted their performance throughout the experiment under
an electrochemical reaction, exhibiting a current density value of
1.58 mA/g from the start to the end of the experimental process. There
was no decay observed in the current density value throughout the
experiment, which evidenced the longtime durability of the electrode
material. Figure 12D represents the stability test over 24 h on optimized 0.5 g PVP-supported
FeWO4 nanocatalysts with a current density of 1.39 mA/g.
There is a strange performance exhibited by the candidate observed
in the CA test, which showed a gradual decrease in performance from
1 to 5 h with the current density value of 0.64 mA/g, but there was
a drastic increment in the current density value with the higher performance
of the candidate observed after 6 h of time duration, which may be
caused by the longtime immersion of the FeWO4 nanocatalysts
in KOH alkaline electrolyte that might have led to the formation of
hydroxyl species of Fe and induced the electrical conductivity of
the electrode during the electrochemical reaction, resulting in the
appreciable improvement in the electrochemical performance of FeWO4 nanocatalysts.51 It has been elaborately
discussed with the help of XPS spectra performed after the stability
test, as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 (a–c) XPS spectra of 0.5 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6: (a) Bi 4f spectrum, (b) W 4f spectrum, and (c) O 1s spectrum.
(d–f) XPS spectra of 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4: (d)
Fe 2p spectrum, (e) W 4f spectrum, and (f) O 1s spectrum.

Figure 13a–c
represents the XPS spectra of the 0.5 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 electrode after 24 h of the stability test that clearly
evidenced that there is no significant difference between the XPS
peak before (in Figure 8) and after the stability test except for the positive shift of the
Bi 4f state identified for the Bi2WO6 electrode
after 24 h of stability. It concurrently demonstrated that there were
no structural disorders observed for the BW2 electrode, and the positive
shift also indicated that there was a partial transfer of electrons
that succeeded between the Bi2O3 and WO3 phases in the orthorhombic Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts
during continuous electrochemical OER.52 Further, the influential positive shift in binding energy observed
for Bi 4f from Figure 13a implicitly suggests that the valence state of Bi may be positively
larger than tungsten. Such kind of electron transfer may occurbecause
of the long-term durability test under continuous water oxidation. Figure 13d–f evidenced
the XPS spectra of the 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4 electrode
after 24 h of stability test. In this case also, a positive shift
is observed for the Fe 2p state, which indicates the partial electron
transfer between the Fe2O3 phase and WO3 phase of the monoclinic FeWO4 nanocatalysts. Further,
the peculiar nature of the W 4f state peak observed around the binding
energy of the characteristic W 4f state may be due to the change in
oxidation states during the incessant electrochemical process; the
clear signature of the Fe(OH)2 phase is evidenced by the
satellite peak around 727 eV, and the hydroxyl species of Fe may also
be confirmed by the peak around 538 eV.53 Moreover, the observed evidence may be caused by the increasing
thickness of the hydrated Fe layer on the surface of the FeWO4 electrode after 5 h of stability test. Hence, this hydroxide
layer increased the conductivity, thereby enhancing the overall OER
activity of the FeWO4 electrode. In addition, the decreased
intensity of the Fe 2p state may be due to the less diffusive nature
on the surface of the electrode after the longtime stability test.
The surface rigidness of the electrode has been further elucidated
by the SEM images in Figure 14.

Figure 14 SEM images performed after the stability test: (a) 0.5 g PVP-assisted
Bi2WO6, (b) 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4 in 2 μm scale range, (c) 0.5 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6, and (d) 0.5 g PVP-assisted FeWO4 in 200
nm scale range.

Figure 14(a,c),(b,d)
represents the surface morphology of the Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 electrodes after the stability test at different
scale ranges such as 2 μm and 200 nm, respectively. Figure 14a,c clearly illustrates
the agglomerated nature of the nanoplates after the durability test
that might be due to the aggregated electrolysis process of the best-performed
Bi2WO6 nanoplate electrode. Figure 14b,d clearly evidenced the
aggregation of nanospheres with some clear cracks, which undoubtedly
is the reason for the rigidness of the electrode surface because of
the intensive OER succeeded during the CA test.54

Figure 15a represents
the CV curve of the best-performed 0.5 g PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 electrode at different scan rates such as 10, 30,
50, 80, and 100 mV/s, respectively, in between the potential window
of −0.4 to 0.6 V. The corresponding capacitive density versus
Ag/AgCl has been displayed. The result represents the linear relationship
between the current density and the corresponding scan rates. As a
result, the specific capacitance of the electrode has been calculated
as 327 F/g for 10 mV/s scan rate and also the electrochemically active
surface area (ECSA) has been calculated from the graph as 0.013 m2/g. Hence, we have achieved a very good ECSA for our best-performed
electrode which provided a greater description about the presence
of more catalytically active sites to achieve an enhanced electrocatalytic
ability of the electrode toward the electrochemical oxidation of water.
The oxygen percentage evolved from the CA test has been detected by
using the Ocean Optics Foxy-R and FOXY-CAL (SO#644877) sensor through
NeoFox software. The oxygen detection test for 1 h under CA test has
been displayed in Figure 15b. This evidenced the evolution of oxygen during the electrochemical
water oxidation by the fabricated BW2 electrode and also the average
value of oxygen evolved was 24.2% throughout the 1 h exploration of
the OER activity.

and (b)

Hence, the entire electrochemical
investigations confirmed the
good, longtime durability of the optimized nanocatalysts prepared
in our work and will undoubtedly explore the utility of multifunctional
nanocatalysts for multiple energy-related applications and will appreciate
the attempts for fabricating such kinds of multifunctional catalysts
in future.

3 Conclusions
The solvothermal route-assisted
PVP capping agent was successfully
optimized for producing novel multifunctional electrodes for electrochemical
water-splitting applications. Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts has been prepared and confirmed through several
characterization techniques such as XRD, Raman, PL, UV–DRS,
and FTIR studies. Well-defined and less-agglomerated nanoplate array
and nanosphere morphologies of the Bi2WO6 and
FeWO4 nanocatalysts were confirmed by the SEM images. The
preparation of durable, long-term, and good-quality electrodes was
succeeded by achieving 2.79 and 1.96 mA/g for the optimized 0.5 g
PVP-assisted Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts,
respectively. The durability of 24 h with 100% retention in the performance
of optimized nanocatalysts was revealed by faster charge-transfer
kinetics obtained from the relatively lower Tafel slope values of
75 and 78 mV/dec, respectively, for OER activity. The fabricated electrodes
will provide a facile path to the young researchers for the production
of multifunctional nanocatalysts for multiple potential applications.

4 Experimental Section
Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate [Bi(NO3)2·5H2O), sodium tungstate dihydrate
(Na2WO4·2H2O), polyvinylpyrrolidone
(C6H9NO)n], iron
sulfate heptahydrate
(FeSO4·7H2O), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2), nitric acid (HNO3), deionized
water, absolute ethanol (C2H5OH), and methanol
(CH3OH) were used. The solvothermal route was optimized
with PVP to produce Bi2WO6 and FeWO4 nanocatalysts. To begin with the Bi2WO6 nanocatalysts
without PVP synthesis, 0.1 M Bi(NO3)2·5H2O was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water which consists
of HNO3 (1 mol/L) to prevent Bi3+ hydrolyzation
in water. Then, 2 M Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water. The above solutions
were mixed together under constant stirring. After 2 h of continuous
stirring, 5 mL of C2H6O2 was added
into the solution. The above solution was further stirred for 24 h
and was then transferred into a 250 mL stainless steel Teflon-lined
autoclave at 180 °C for 16 h. Similarly, the above solution was
prepared with 0.5 and 1 g of PVP, and the other procedure was the
same as that of bare sample preparation. After naturally cooling down
to room temperature, the precipitations were filtered by a Whatman
filter sheet and calcinated at 400 °C for 2 h and were named
BW-1, BW-2, and BW-3, respectively. In a similar way, FeWO4 nanocatalysts were prepared by a controlled solvothermal route and
named FW-1, FW-2, and FW-3. The characterization techniques explored
for the entire nanocatalysts were the same as that of the previous
literature reports.9,19,55−57

Binder-free electrode preparation needed cautious
steps to follow.
The prepared active nanocatalysts were first measured, and 3 mg of
active material was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol under 20 min of ultrasonication.
A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was ultrasonicated for 5 min for cleaning
purpose. Then, 10 μL of the dispersed active material was drop-casted
on a cleaned GCE that was left for 24 h at room temperature. Approximately,
30 μg of the material was loaded on the GCE that was then utilized
as a working electrode to study the efficient electrochemical water
splitting in a conventional three-electrode cell setup through the
SP-150 Biologic workstation. The electrolyte solution used was 1 M
KOH. Platinum wire and Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter and
reference electrodes, respectively.
