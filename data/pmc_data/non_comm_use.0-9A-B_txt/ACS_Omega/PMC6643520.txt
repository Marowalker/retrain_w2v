We report key results of a systematic
computational investigation using density functional theory along
with the two standard Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof and hybrid
Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) exchange–correlation
formalisms on essential fundamental parameters for solar energy conversion
of a series of large, medium, and small selected (covalent, binary,
and ternary) materials widely utilized in fuel cells, photocatalysis,
optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and dye-sensitized solar devices such
as BN, AlN, C, ZrO2, Na2Ta4O11, Bi4Ti3O12, ZnS, GaN, SrTiO3, TiO2, Bi12TiO20, SiC, WO3, TaON, ZnSe, BiVO4, CuNbO3, CdS, AlP,

that the optoelectronic and redox parameters computed with HSE06 reproduce
with very good accuracy the experimental results, thanks to precise
electronic structure calculations. Applying this first-principle quantum
methodology led us to provide a rational design of new suitable solid

1 Introduction
The design of new materials with particular
fundamental features in relation with solar light absorption, dissociation
ability of photogenerated exciton, transport of charge carriers, and
their ability to be driven for water redox reactions is of major importance
for converting solar energy into clean hydrogen from water splitting.1−3

Although the fabrication
of highly crystalline material with a very minimal number of defects
is essential, the design of a suitable photocatalyst for good solar-driven
water splitting needs at least these four additional challenging fundamental
parameters to be present: (a) specific band gap energy between 2.0
and 2.5 eV for good solar photon absorption in the visible region;
(b) high macroscopic dielectric constant (greater than 10) together
with low exciton binding energy (<25 meV) for the good dissociation
of excitons to free holes and electrons at room temperature;4−9 (c) small electron
and hole effective masses (<0.5me, me is the free electron mass) along two different
crystallographic directions for the good charge carrier transport
throughout the crystal lattice together with the low possible electron/hole
recombination rate on the surface;4,10,11 (d) lower valence band maxima (VBM) energy position
than the O2/H2O level and higher conduction
band minima (CBM) than the H+/H2 level for driving
the generated holes and excited electrons for water oxidation and
protons reduction, respectively.12

Modern density functional theory (DFT) is considered nowadays as
an extremely valuable tool to calculate these challenging fundamental
parameters because of the encountered difficulty in obtaining or quantifying
them in experiments. Achieving accurate computations, as requested
here, is dependent on the type of a functional adopted for the description
of different interactions associated with electron–electron
correlation and exchange.

In recent computational works reported
on electronic structure features of three-dimensional transition-metal
oxide-, oxynitride-, and nitride-based semiconductor materials,13−20 we have demonstrated
that the use of DFT together with the range-separated hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE06)21,22 exchange–correlation functional leads
to much more accurate results than those obtained from the standard
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)23 functional in comparison with experiments.

Our theoretical
results obtained in these studies motivated us to carry out a systematic
DFT investigation [including the perturbation approach density functional
perturbation theory (DFPT)] on essential fundamental parameters for
solar energy conversion of a series of large, medium, and small band
gap selected (covalent, binary and ternary) materials widely utilized
in fuel cells, photocatalysis, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and
dye-sensitized solar devices such as BN, AlN, C, ZrO2,
Na2Ta4O11, Bi4Ti3O12, ZnS, GaN, SrTiO3, TiO2, Bi12TiO20, SiC, WO3, TaON, ZnSe, BiVO4, CuNbO3, CdS, AlP, ZnTe, GaP, Cu2O,
AlAs, Ta3N5, BP, CdSe, SnWO4, GaAs,
CdTe, and Si. In this paper, we first report the electronic band gaps
of these materials by considering the spin–orbit-coupling (SOC)
interaction to determine the influence of relativistic effects on
the computed band gap of solids containing heavy elements (atomic
number greater than 56 such as Bi, W, and Ta) using the standard PBE
and the range-separated hybrid HSE06 functionals. Then, we report
the VBM/CBM energy levels relative to water redox potentials, the
macroscopic (electronic + ionic) dielectric constants, the charge
carrier effective masses, and the exciton binding energy of some relevant
materials among them using both the PBE and HSE06 functionals. We
systematically compared our calculated values with the available experimental
data to define an accurate first-principle quantum approach to be
followed for predicting new suitable materials for visible light-driven
photochemical water splitting and helping the experimentalists with
a rational design of promising candidates for solar energy conversion
applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electronic
Properties
We summarize in Figure 1 the computed band gaps with the PBE and
HSE06 functionals in comparison with available experimental data4,11,13−18,24−31 of a series of 30 selected semiconductors such as BN, AlN, C, ZrO2, Na2Ta4O11, Bi4Ti3O12, ZnS, GaN, SrTiO3, TiO2, Bi12TiO20, SiC, WO3, TaON,
ZnSe, BiVO4, CuNbO3, CdS, AlP, ZnTe, GaP, Cu2O, AlAs, Ta3N5, BP, CdSe, SnWO4, GaAs, CdTe, and Si. Our obtained values with HSE06 show an excellent
agreement compared to experiments with small error percentages in
the 0–7% range for large or small band gaps and the 3–6%
range for medium band gaps, while those computed with PBE reveal strongly
underestimated values by 18–40% for large band gaps, 32–72%
for medium band gaps, and 33–47% for large band gaps with respect
to the experimental ones. Detailed information about the corresponding
supercell models and computed values is reported in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. As previously reported
on reference materials,13−20,32−35 the
well-known band gap underestimation using generalized gradient approximation
functionals can be greatly improved by the use of HSE06. The PBE functional
gives smaller band gap energy values than the experimental ones, whereas
the hybrid functionals such as PBE0 and B3LYP compute larger band
gaps compared to experiments.32,33 These results confirm
again the need of using the range-separated hybrid HSE06 functional
rather than the standard one like PBE to accurately predict the experimental
band gaps of semiconductor compounds.

Figure 1 Small (in the 1–2
eV range), medium (in the 2–3 eV range), and large (in the
3–6 eV range) band gaps of a large number of selected semiconductor
crystals computed using the PBE and HSE06 functionals and compared
to available experimental data.4,11,13−18,24−31

2.2 Redox Properties
We show in Figure 2 the computed VBM and CBM energy
levels using HSE06 in comparison with available experimental data1,26 of eight selected semiconductors largely utilized in fuel cells,
photocatalysis, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and dye-sensitized
solar devices, such as ZrO2, ZnS, TiO2, SiC,
CdS, GaP, CdSe, and Si. Overall, our obtained values show a very good
agreement compared to experiments with small error percentages in
the 0.5–2.5% range for the VBM and 0.5–8% for the CBM.
The lower accuracy for the CBM computed values with respect to the
measured ones particularly in the cases of SiC and Si crystals comes
from such discrepancy in the predicted band gap energy value, while
the predicted VBM values were not affected that much by such a band
gap difference. Detailed information about the corresponding slab
models and computed values is given in Figures S1–S3 in the Supporting Information.

By applying the
computational protocol based on the HSE06 functional, we have predicted
suitable band gaps and VBM/CBM energy positions of Ti0.94O2Se0.06, TiO2Se0.06,
TiO1.94Se0.06, TiO1.94Te0.06, Ti0.94O2Te0.06, Ta0.5Nb0.5ON, and Ta0.75V0.25ON materials
for solar-driven photochemical water splitting (see Figure 3). TiO1.94Se0.06, TiO1.94Te0.06, Ti0.94O2Se0.06, Ti0.94O2Te0.06, and TiO2Se0.06 doped materials
were generated from 6 at. % of Se and Te locally substituted at O
and Ti sites in the tetragonal lattice of anatase TiO2 or
inserted into the anatase TiO2 crystal lattice. Ta0.5Nb0.5ON and Ta0.75V0.25ON solid solution materials were generated from homogenous distributions
of 50 at. % of Nb and 25 at. % of V substituted at Ta sites in the
TaON monoclinic crystal lattice, respectively. Detailed information
about the corresponding DFT-based atomic and electronic structures
is reported in refs.19,36−38

solar-driven photochemical water splitting.

2.3 Dielectric and Transport
Properties
Obtaining suitable band gap and VBM/CBM energy
levels for H+ reduction and water oxidation cannot guarantee
whether such a photocatalyst is a good candidate for solar-driven
water splitting. Also, it is reasonable to note that the band positions
are not a direct evidence for water splitting and modeling catalysis
is more direct. As mentioned in the introduction, other fundamental
properties related to the capability of exciton separation into free
carriers as well as the possibility of their migration from bulk to
surface need to be carefully investigated. Following this, we have
first performed benchmark tests on six selected semiconductors largely
utilized in photocatalysis and photovoltaics, such as TiO2, CdS, CdSe, GaAs, CdTe, and Si by computing their dielectric constant,
electron/hole effective masses, and binding energy of exciton using
PBE and HSE06 functionals and comparing them to the available experimental
data.4−11,39 With respect to the dielectric constant
calculations, our obtained values with HSE06 correctly reproduce the
experiments with small error percentages going from 0 up to 11%, while
those obtained with PBE provide an overestimation by 5–33%
with respect to the measured values. The good description of a dielectric
constant with HSE06 is directly dependent on the good band gap description,
while the overestimation in the case of PBE is mainly due to the underestimated
predicted band gap values compared to experiments. Regarding the charge
carrier effective mass calculations, although our obtained values
of hole effective masses with both PBE and HSE06 functionals give
a similar trend in most of cases with error percentages going from
2 to 35% and from 0 to 29% relative to experiments, respectively,
those for electron effective masses computed with HSE06 show a better
accuracy in some cases compared to the measured ones with smaller
error percentages in the 10–27% range than those obtained with
PBE (11–56%). Concerning the exciton binding energy calculations,
our computed values with HSE06 reveal a very good agreement compared
to experiments with relatively small error percentages going from
0 up to 14%, whereas those calculated with PBE give strongly underestimated
values by 12–56%. These results clearly confirm the necessity
of going beyond the standard PBE functional and using the hybrid one
like HSE06 to predict with better accuracy the experimental optoelectronic
properties of semiconductor materials. Detailed information about
the computed values is provided in Tables S2–S4 in the Supporting Information.

By applying the
HSE06-based computational scheme, we have investigated the key fundamental
properties of Ti0.94O2Se0.06, TiO2Se0.06, TiO1.94Se0.06, TiO1.94Te0.06, Ti0.94O2Te0.06, Ta0.5Nb0.5ON, and Ta0.75V0.25ON crystals for solar-driven photochemical water
splitting. Regarding the dielectric constant calculations, we found
small values (in the 6.8–9.7 range) for Ti0.94O2Se0.06, TiO2Se0.06, TiO1.94Se0.06, TiO1.94Te0.06,
and Ti0.94O2Te0.06, while large values
of 28.5 for Ta0.5Nb0.5ON and 32.6 for Ta0.75V0.25ON were found, respectively. This trend
indicates good separation ability for excitons to free carriers using
Ta0.5Nb0.5ON and Ta0.75V0.25ON, whereas this ability is expected to be low in the cases of Ti0.94O2Se0.06, TiO2Se0.06, TiO1.94Se0.06, TiO1.94Te0.06, and Ti0.94O2Te0.06. Concerning
the charge carrier effective mass calculations, the anisotropic nature
was revealed in the obtained values of the various crystals along
the three main crystallographic directions. For Ti0.94O2Se0.06, TiO2Se0.06, TiO1.94Se0.06, TiO1.94Te0.06,
and Ti0.94O2Te0.06, we found very
large hole effective mass values (in the 8–14me range), in line with the strongly localized p-orbitals
nature of VBM states on Se- or Te-doping species and O species located
around as shown in Figure 4. This trend is expected to limit the hole mobility only around
the doping species, increase the electron/hole pair recombination
rate inside the bulk, and therefore, lead to low photocatalytic activities
under visible-light irradiation as observed in the synthesized Se-
and Te-modified TiO2 powders.40−42 As per Ta0.5Nb0.5ON
and Ta0.75V0.25ON, we obtained 1.5me, 1.4me, and 0.3me for holes and 0.3me, 0.9me, and 0.5me for
electrons in the case of Ta0.5Nb0.5ON and 1.9me, 1.2me, and 0.2me for holes with 1.4me, 0.4me, and 0.7me for electrons in the case of Ta0.75V0.25ON along the three ⟨100⟩, ⟨010⟩, and
⟨001⟩ principal directions, respectively. In both cases,
the lightest effective mass of holes is found in the ⟨001⟩
orientation with values of 0.3me and 0.2me, in accordance with the more pronounced delocalization
nature of p-orbitals on N species associated to the VBM states along
this specific lattice orientation (see Figure 5). The smallest electron effective mass of
0.30me for Ta0.5Nb0.5ON and 0.38me for Ta0.75V0.25ON were obtained in the ⟨100⟩ and ⟨010⟩
directions, respectively, in line with the more pronounced delocalized
character of d-orbitals on V, Nb, and Ta species corresponding to
the CBM states along the two specific lattice orientations as shown
in Figure 5.

using HSE06. The isovalue is 0.004 a.u.

states (on the top) of Ta0.5Nb0.5ON and Ta0.75V0.25ON crystals obtained using HSE06. The isovalue
is 0.004 a.u.

As a consequence, the highest hole mobility is expected along the
⟨001⟩ direction, while the highest mobility of electrons
is expected either along the ⟨100⟩ or ⟨010⟩
orientation. Because of the fact that both effective masses are relatively
small, good carrier transport features are expected along these three
specific crystalline directions where the two co-catalysts for oxygen
evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction should be deposited
on surfaces perpendicular to those crystallographic directions. Here,
the holes/electron migration seems to be easy along different crystalline
orientations, and this is what we typically need to enhance the separation
of holes and electrons or reduce the electron/hole recombination rate
at the photocatalyst–water interface in order to enable for
the holes to oxidize water and generate oxygen and for the electrons
to reduce protons and generate hydrogen. Note that using this type
of analysis and interpretation in the framework of combined experimental
and theoretical assessments, we could successfully determine the fundamental
origins behind the poor H2 or O2 evolution performance
of UV light-responsive Bi12TiO20 and Bi4Ti3O12 photocatalysts as well as of
common visible light-responsive BiVO4, SnWO4, (Na2–xCux)Ta4O11, TaON, and Ta3N5 photocatalysts.13−18,43

3 Conclusions
Developing
new semiconductor-based electronic devices for harvesting solar energy
into hydrogen chemical fuel through overall water splitting reactions
represents a grand opportunity at low cost for the energy future.

In the work presented here, we have investigated using DFT along
with the two standard PBE and hybrid HSE06 exchange–correlation
formalisms, essential fundamental parameters for solar energy conversion
of a series of large, medium, and small selected (covalent, binary
and ternary) materials widely utilized in fuel cells, photocatalysis,
optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and dye-sensitized solar devices such
as BN, AlN, C, ZrO2, Na2Ta4O11, Bi4Ti3O12, ZnS, GaN, SrTiO3, TiO2, Bi12TiO20, SiC, WO3, TaON, ZnSe, BiVO4, CuNbO3, CdS, AlP,
ZnTe, GaP, Cu2O, AlAs, Ta3N5, BP,
CdSe, SnWO4, GaAs, CdTe, and Si. A systematic comparison
between the computed values and the available experimental data was
also highlighted to confirm the accuracy of these two computational
methods.

For the electronic band gap calculations, our predicted
values with HSE06 showed an excellent agreement compared to experiments
with small error percentages in the 0–7% range for large or
small band gaps and in the 3–6% range for medium band gaps,
while those computed with PBE revealed strongly underestimated values
in the 18–40% range for large band gaps, 32–72% for
medium band gaps, and 33–47% for large band gaps with respect
to the experimental ones. For the band energy levels relative to water
redox potential calculations, our obtained values using HSE06 showed
a very good agreement compared to experiments with small error percentages
in the 0.5–2.5% range for VBM and 0.5–8% for CBM.

Regarding the dielectric constant calculations, our obtained values
with HSE06 correctly reproduced the experiments with small error percentages
going from 0 up to 11%, whereas those obtained with PBE provided an
overestimation by 5–33% with respect to the measured values.
With respect to the charge carrier effective mass calculations, our
obtained values of hole effective masses with both PBE and HSE06 functionals
have given a similar trend in most of cases with error percentages
going from 2 to 35% and from 0 to 29% relative to experiments, respectively,
while those for electron effective masses computed with HSE06 showed
a better accuracy in some cases compared to the measured ones with
smaller error percentages in the 10–27% range than those obtained
with PBE (11–56%). Concerning the exciton binding energy calculations,
our computed values with HSE06 revealed a very good agreement compared
to experiments with relatively small error percentages going from
0 up to 14%, whereas those calculated with PBE have given strongly
underestimated values in the 12–56% range.

In conclusion,
we have clearly shown that the computational approach based on DFT
along with the range-separated hybrid HSE06 reveals very good accuracy
in predicting the optoelectronic and redox properties of semiconductors,
thanks to precise electronic structure calculations. The use of this
first-principle quantum methodology led us to provide a rational design
of new suitable solid solution materials for visible light-driven
photochemical water splitting. This strategy will definitely be applied
to predict and propose promising candidates to the experimentalists
for solar-to-chemical energy conversion.

4 Computational Methods
The simulation of the
studied materials was performed by considering the common crystalline
phases identified experimentally using both synchrotron and neutron
powder diffraction techniques (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for more details). The corresponding
crystal structures were fully optimized using the periodic DFT implemented
in the Vienna Ab initio Software Package (VASP).44−47 As reported
in Table S1, supercell models were considered
rather than unit cells to better describe the required properties
by minimizing any possible error that might be generated by the periodic
boundaries. The PBE functional,23 cutoff
energy of 400 eV for wave functions, projector augmented-wave approach,48 and different Monkhorst–Pack k-point grids49 for Brillouin
zone integrations were employed, as reported in Table S1. The valence electrons treated in the computations
were 2s22p1 for B, 2s22p3 for N, 3s23p1 for Al, 4s24p1 for Ga, 2s22p2 for C, 3d104s2 for Zn, 3s23p4 for S, 4s24p4 for Se, 3s23p3 for P,
5s24p4 for Te, 4s24p3 for
As, 4d105s2 for Cd, 3s23p2 for Si, 4d25s2 for Zr, 2s22p4 for O, 3d24s2 for Ti, 5d46s2 for W, 5d36s2 for Ta, 6s26p3 for Bi, 3d34s2 for V,
5s25p2 for Sn, 3s1 for Na, 4s24p65s2 for Sr, 3d104s1 for Cu, and 4s24p64d45s1 for Nb. The ionic positions and the lattice parameters were
fully optimized until the values of the Hellman–Feynman forces
were less than 0.01 eV·Å–1. For the self-consistent
field cycles, an energy convergence criterion of 10–6 eV was fixed for each supercell. Our PBE calculated lattice constants
were found in very good agreement compared to experiments with very
small percentage errors going from 0 to 1%. Additional runs with 500
eV cutoff energy showed that the lattice constants and bonding lengths
reached their convergence at 400 eV.

The electronic band gap
and k-space band structure of each material were
computed by employing the standard PBE23 and the range-separated hybrid HSE0621,22 exchange–correlation
functionals implemented in VASP program, based on the optimized geometries
obtained using PBE. Note that in the HSE06 formalism, a range separation
approach is counted for the exchange part, while the correlation part
is defined by PBE. The range-separation parameter was fixed at 0.2
Å. For long-range interactions, the PBE exchange is taken, whereas
a mixture with 25% of Hartree–Fock and 75% of PBE is used for
short-range interactions. To determine the influence of relativistic
effects on the computed band gap of solids containing heavy elements
(atomic number greater than 56), the SOC interaction was also considered
using both PBE and HSE06 functionals. An increased cutoff energy of
500 eV was used to guarantee good convergence of the band gaps.

The electronic dielectric constant of each compound was calculated
using the self-consistent response of the crystal to an external electric
field50 implemented in the VASP program
along with the PBE and HSE06 functionals. The ionic dielectric constant
was obtained by calculating the phonon frequencies of the crystal
by means of DFPT within the linear response method implemented in
VASP using the PBE formalism. The macroscopic dielectric constant
was obtained from the sum of the two electronic and ionic contributions.
The effective masses for holes and electrons of each material were
calculated based on their electronic band structure obtained with
PBE and HSE06 using the finite difference method.51 The exciton binding energy of each compound was computed
using the hydrogenic model.52 More information
about these methods is reported in refs.13−16

ZrO2, ZnS, TiO2, SiC, CdS, GaP, CdSe,
and Si–vacuum interfaces were simulated by building (2 ×
1), (2 × 1), (1 × 1), (1 × 1), (1 × 1), (2 ×
1), (1 × 1), and (1 × 1) thick slabs containing 6, 8, 6,
14, 13, 8, 13, and 9 atomic layers of the most common (100), (110),
(110), (110), (110), (110), (110), and (111) surfaces, respectively,
as shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. Each slab was relaxed by keeping constant the lattice parameters
at the optimized values of the bulk. The vacuum thickness was refined
for each crystal to minimize such possible interactions between the
two opposite borders of the slab. Besides, the slab thickness needed
to obtain the bulk band gap of each material was also carefully checked.
Slab and vacuum thicknesses of 15, 14, 15, 20, 20, 14, 20, and 20
Å well reproduced the bulk signature of ZrO2, ZnS,
TiO2, SiC, CdS, GaP, CdSe, and Si crystals, respectively,
as shown in Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information when compared to the computed bulk band gap values
reported in Table S1. Note that the Si
located on the upper layers of Si and SiC slabs was passivated with
H to reproduce correctly the band gap of these materials by removing
any spurious electronic states coming from unsaturated or subcoordinated
Si species on the surface. The absolute energy of vacuum was obtained
for each crystal from the total local potential profile calculation
using the VASP program together with the HSE06 functional over plans
parallel to the corresponding surfaces, as shown in Figures S2 and S3. Such errors appeared from boundary conditions
were corrected in each case by including corrections on the dipole
during the local potential computation.53 Then, the VBM and CBM energy positions of each crystal relative
to the vacuum level were obtained from the difference between the
energies of VBM and CBM obtained using the slab calculations and the
energy of the vacuum level. Detailed information about this methodology
is reported in ref (43).
