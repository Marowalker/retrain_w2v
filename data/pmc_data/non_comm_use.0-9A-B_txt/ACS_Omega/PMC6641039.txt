Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase
(LPMO) enzymes have attracted
considerable attention owing to their ability to enhance polysaccharide
depolymerization, making them interesting with respect to production
of biofuel from cellulose. LPMOs are metalloenzymes that contain a
mononuclear copper active site, capable of activating dioxygen. However,
many details of this activation are unclear. Some aspects of the mechanism
have previously been investigated from a computational angle. Yet,
either these studies have employed only molecular mechanics (MM),
which are inaccurate for metal active sites, or they have described
only the active site with quantum mechanics (QM) and neglected the
effect of the protein. Here, we employ hybrid QM and MM (QM/MM) methods
to investigate the first steps of the LPMO mechanism, which is reduction
of CuII to CuI and the formation of a CuII–superoxide complex. In the latter complex, the superoxide
can bind either in an equatorial or an axial position. For both steps,
we obtain structures that are markedly different from previous suggestions,
based on small QM-cluster calculations. Our calculations show that
the equatorial isomer of the superoxide complex is over 60 kJ/mol
more stable than the axial isomer because it is stabilized by interactions
with a second-coordination-sphere glutamine residue, suggesting a
possible role for this residue. The coordination of superoxide in
this manner agrees with recent experimental suggestions.

1 Introduction
Employing
cellulose in biofuel production can make this advancing
technology a highly competitive alternative to fossil fuels. As a
major component of biomass, cellulose is inexpensive and the most
abundant polysaccharide on earth.1 However,
the application of cellulose in biofuel production requires its degradation
into smaller sugars, which has been shown to be a major obstacle,
requiring both hydrolytic enzymes and thermal work. This remarkable
stability is caused by its structure, involving very long glucan chains,
which are composed of glucose monomers, coupled together by β-1,4
glycosidic linkages. The glucan chains interact with each other by
an extensive network of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds involving
the three hydroxyl groups of each glucose monomer, which limits the
accessibility of hydrolytic enzymes to the glycosidic linkages.2,3

Lately, a class of fungal and bacterial enzymes called lytic
polysaccharide
monooxygenases (LPMOs) have attracted considerable attention owing
to their ability to enhance polysaccharide depolymerization, thereby
providing a route to efficient conversion of cellulose into fermentable
sugars.4−6 The first industrial applications have already been
seen for ethanol production.7 Initially,
LPMO enzymes9,10 were assumed to be solely hydrolytic
and were classified as belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 61 (GH61)
and carbohydrate-binding modules 33 (CBM33) families. Initial reports
questioning whether GH61 indeed were hydrolases were published in
2008,11 and in 2010, Harris et al.12 showed that an LPMO from the GH61 family significantly
enhanced cellulase activity (a few earlier reports are also known
from the patent literature13,14). The exact role of
LPMOs was demonstrated later in 2010 by Vaaje-Kolstad et al.,15 who showed that a bacterial LPMO belonging to
the CBM33 family exhibited an oxidative mechanism. Importantly, these
studies suggested the involvement of a metal, although the nature
of this metal was not immediately elucidated. Yet, it was clear that
the LPMOs employed a common mechanism, different from the traditional
glycoside hydrolases, and the enzymes are today reclassified as auxiliary
activity enzymes AA9 (formerly GH61) and AA10 (formerly CBM33).16 From X-ray crystallography and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, Quinlan et al.8 was able to show that LPMOs employ copper in the active site, which
solved the initial confusion concerning the metal site.11,12,15 Later, several other reports
confirmed that both AA9 and AA10 enzymes contain a single copper ion.8,17−24

The active site of an AA9 enzyme is shown in Figure 1, together with a putative
mechanism.17 For the resting state, 1, the first
coordination sphere is distorted octahedral and comprises a weakly
coordinated tyrosine, two water molecules, and an unusual histidine brace composed of two histidine residues, coordinating
through the imidazole group. One of these is the N-terminal residue,
which also coordinates through the terminal NH2 group,8 as also seen in the particulate methane monooxygenases.25 Notably, a peculiar methylation of this N-terminal
histidine has been observed in many fungal LPMO structures,8,11,26−29 although its role is unclear
because the nonmethylated enzyme is also catalytically active.28,29

Figure 1 Active
site and putative mechanism of a fungal LPMO (bacterial
LPMOs lack the axial tyrosine residue but are likely to work through
a similar mechanism). The order of events (electron transfer, substrate
uptake, and O2 coordination) is not clarified as suggested
by the different possible paths. Residue numbers refer to the enzyme
from Thermoascus aurantiacus (PDB 2YET).8

EPR spectroscopy8 has shown that 1 contains a CuII ion.30 The EPR spectra provide an important
complement to X-ray structures
because Cu is known to be photoreduced in the X-ray beam. In fact,
it is likely that most LPMO crystal structures have contained a mixture
of CuII and CuI.4,5,29 The reduction gives rise to a lowering of the coordination
number, and many AA10 structures have been reported to have an approximate
T-shaped coordination environment, indicating that the metal site
contains a CuI ion.4,21,31

The mechanism of the LPMOs is far from clarified, and even
the
order of reduction, substrate binding, and O2 uptake is
unknown, as suggested by Figure 1. A complicating factor is that there is much sequence
variation within the LPMO family,32,33 and different
LPMOs might employ slightly different mechanisms. For instance, the
axial tyrosine (Tyr175 in Figure 1) is replaced by phenylalanine in most AA10 LPMOs.
A different mechanism could explain the differing substrate preferences
among the LPMOs: fungal AA9 enzymes oxidize cellulose,8,12,17,18 whereas AA10 enzymes oxidize both cellulose20,34,35 and chitin.15,20,34 Fungal LPMOs that break down chitin or starch have
also been identified and are classified as AA1136 and AA13,37,38 respectively.

Apart from
varying preferences with respect to substrate, LPMOs
also have different regioselectivity: some oxidize only the C1 atom
of the glycoside linkage, others oxidize only the C4 atom, whereas
still others can oxidize both C1 and C4. This has led to a subclassification
of the AA9 family, in that enzymes belonging to the LPMO type 1 subfamily
are C1 specific, those belonging to LPMO type 2 are C4 specific, and
those belonging to LPMO type 3 oxidize both C1 and C4.39 Bacterial LPMOs (AA10) were initially thought
to be C1 specific15,20,35 until a C4-specific counterexample was identified.34

Although the insight gained from experimental studies
has been
paramount, it has often been complemented by computational chemistry.
For instance, the interaction between a fungal LPMO and cellulose
has been studied using molecular dynamics methods,29,40 whereas the structural change upon CuII reduction (1 → 2 in Figure 1) has been studied using X-ray diffraction
and X-ray absorption, combined with density functional theory (DFT).31,41 The copper superoxide intermediate (3) has also been
the target of multiple combined theoretical and experimental studies
and has played a central role in mechanistic suggestions so far. This
intermediate is believed to either directly abstract a hydrogen from
the substrate5 or function as a precursor
for a more reactive copper–oxyl species that is involved in
hydrogen abstraction.42

The coordination
of O2 to Cu in 3 may give
rise to two isomers because there are two possible coordination sites
for O2 (although this complication has often been overlooked).
One study42 suggested that O2 binds in an axial position, trans to Tyr175, replacing W229 (see Figure 1), whereas a combined
spectroscopic and computational study suggested that O2 instead binds equatorially,41 replacing
W230. However, each study investigated only one of the two isomers.
Furthermore, all previous computation studies on LPMOs have been carried
out using small models of the active site,31,41,42 although it has been shown that the protein
environment is crucial for accurate structures and energetics in studies
on transition-metal enzymes.43−51

In this study, we investigated the reduction of the LPMO active
site from 1 to 2 and the two isomers of 3. We include the protein environment with the combined quantum
mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methodology.52−55 Using our QM/MM protocol, we can show that the small cluster models
of the active site employed previously can give rise to large errors
in the obtained structures.

2 Results
We start
this section by discussing whether our computational protocol
can reproduce the observed31,41 decrease in coordination
number when CuII is reduced to CuI (section 2.1). We then proceed
to discuss the O2 bound states (section 2.2).

2.1 Structural Changes When
the Resting State
Is Reduced
The optimized structures and selected Cu–ligand
distances of 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 2. The bond distances
are compared with the computational results from the literature and
with bond distances from a number of crystal structures in Table 1.

Figure 2 Structural changes upon
reduction of 1 to 2. Both figures contain
an overlay of structures obtained with the
def2-SV(P) (transparent) and def2-TZVPD basis sets. The selected bond
distances are for the def2-TZVPD basis set, with those of the def2-SV(P)
basis set in parentheses. The second-sphere Gln173 residue is also
included.

b Optimized with B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVPD.

c This is from an AA10 LPMO enzyme,
whose reduction in the X-ray beam has been carefully followed.

We start by discussing the results
obtained with TPSS/def2-SV(P)
and system 2 relaxed (entries 1free and 2free in Table 1). Despite the reduction of the Cu ion, the lengths
of the three Cu–N bonds do not change by more than 0.08 Å,
which emphasizes the fact that the active site is constructed to accommodate
both CuII and CuI.
Furthermore, the effect of reducing CuII to CuI is an elongation of the Cu–O bonds of Tyr175 and the equatorial
water molecule (W230) to 3.0 Å. Meanwhile, the Cu–O bond
to the other water molecule shortens from 2.8 to 2.3 Å. Therefore,
the Cu ion becomes essentially four-coordinated, rather than 5- or
6-coordinated (octahedral).

Considering these small differences in the Cu–N bonds lengths
upon reduction, it is surprising that the calculated distances reproduce
the distances in the starting crystal structure (2YET8) so poorly: those to the side-chain imidazole rings are
0.3–0.5 Å too short. We, therefore, optimized structures
with the larger def2-TZVPD basis set, both with the TPSS and B3LYP
functionals. However, as can be seen in Table 1, this did not lead to any major changes
in the Cu–N bond lengths. In particular, those to the histidine
side chains changed by less than 0.05 Å. A comparison with a
range of other crystal LPMO structures (also in Table 1) shows that the Cu–Nδ bonds in the 2YET are highly untypical, being 0.3–0.5 Å too long. If we
instead compare with the other crystal structures, the calculated
Cu–N bond lengths fall well within the range observed in the
crystal structures, with a maximum difference of 0.10 Å for the
Cu–NHis1 in the oxidized state and 0.05 Å for
the other distances compared with the average of the five crystal
structures.

Comparison of structures with the surrounding protein
(system 2)
fixed or free to relax (fixed or free structures in Table 1) shows that there are only
small differences for the reduced state 2 (up to 0.03
Å except for the weak bond to Tyr175, which changes by 0.16 Å).
However, for the oxidized state (1), much larger changes
are seen: the bond length to Tyr175 decreases from 2.80 to 2.34 Å,
whereas that to the axial water molecule increases by almost the same
amount, that is, from 2.28 to 2.83 Å. This indicates that the
crystal structure represents a predominantly reduced state (with a
long bond to Tyr175) and that fixing the junction at the Cβ atoms of Tyr175 is too restrictive to model the full flexibility
of this residue during the reduction. As will be discussed in section 2.2, it is also
too restrictive to describe the distance in the intermediate 3. Therefore, we generally expect large differences in this
bond distance when compared with various vacuum studies, where it
is customary to fix Cβ to its initial location from
the crystal structure, and this is indeed the case (as will be discussed
below). The Tyr175 residue has recently been speculated to have implications
for the LMPO mechanism,56 and the Cu–O
distances are therefore crucial, but it should also be remembered
that axial bonds in Cu complexes are weak and extremely flexible (i.e.,
the distance to Cu can vary a lot at a minimal expense in energy).57−59 This was reflected in the rather large variation of these bond lengths
in the structures optimized with different basis sets and DFT functionals
(up to 0.5 Å) and in the various crystal structures (up to 0.7
Å) as can be seen in Table 1.

Our structures for 1 and 2 are mostly
in agreement with the results from previous computational studies31,41,42 (also included in Table 1). The Cu–N distances
agree, except that the Cu–NHis1 distance in the
reduced state (2) is somewhat shorter (1.97–2.11
Å in our structures, compared with 2.14–2.27 Å in
the previous studies). All of these studies also suggest that the
coordination number of the Cu ion decreases when it is reduced, as
expected. However, these studies differ in their predictions regarding
which of the three prospective O ligands bind and at what distance.
For the oxidized state (1), all studies agree that the
equatorial water molecule binds strongly, although the Cu–O
distance is ∼0.2 Å longer in the study by Kim et al.42 than those in the other studies. Both Kim et
al.42 and Gudmundsson et al.31 also suggested that the second water molecule
coordinates to Cu (although ref (42) does not report the bond distance to the axial
water molecule) in agreement with our result with a fixed surrounding.
However, when we allow the protein to relax, we instead find that
Tyr175 coordinates weakly to Cu, whereas the axial water molecule
practically dissociates.

For the reduced state (2), all studies agree that
both Tyr175 and the equatorial water molecule effectively dissociate.
However, for the axial water molecule, the results differ. Kim et
al.42 suggested that it binds rather strongly
at a Cu–O distance of 2.19 Å, whereas the other two studies
indicated that it also dissociates.31,41 Our results
are intermediate: with the def2-SV(P) basis set, we obtain a rather
short Cu–O bond of ∼2.2 Å. However, with the larger
def2-TZVPD basis set, and especially with the B3LYP functional, the
Cu–O bond becomes appreciably longer, 2.54 and 2.74 Å,
respectively.

Clearly, this reflects the flexibility of the
weak Cu–O
bonds, as mentioned above.57−59 These bond lengths are determined
more by interactions with the surrounding protein than by the Cu–O
interaction. Therefore, it is likely that our QM/MM results, with
an explicit account of the surroundings, give more accurate results.
However, it is clear that these bonds are sensitive to the theoretical
treatment, as our results indicate and as has been pointed out before.41

2.2 Copper–Superoxide
Intermediates
Next, we discuss the nature of the CuII–superoxide
adduct, 3. It is expected to form through the binding
of O2 to the reduced active site (see Figure 1). As mentioned above, there
are two possible isomers (3eq or 3ax) of this complex, depending on whether O2 replaces the equatorial or the axial water molecule. At variance
with the previous studies, we have studied both isomers. The optimized
structures and selected bond distances of the two isomers are shown
in Figure 3 and Table 2, whereas the energy
difference between them is shown in the upper part of Table 3.

Figure 3 Comparison of the axial
and equatorial isomers of 3, showing also the Gln173
residue that can interact with O2–. The
structures were optimized in the triplet
states (S = 1) with the TPSS-D3 functional and the
def2-SV(P) basis set. The corresponding bond lengths are shown in Table 2.

a ΔEQM/MM and ΔEQM+ptch are defined in eq 1 and ΔEQM/MM = EMM123 – EMM1 from the same equation. EQM is the energy of the QM system, without any point-charge
model. Ebig-QM is the big-QM energy.
All energies were calculated or extrapolated (ΔEbig-QM) with the def2-TZVPP basis set on structures
optimized using QM/MM using the def2-SV(P) basis set. In ΔEbig-QM, 10.8 kJ/mol (3free) or −1.3 kJ/mol (3eqfree) of the total energy is a
correction obtained as the difference between def2-TZVPP and def2-SV(P)
calculations on the QM systems in Figure 6.

Our results clearly show that the equatorial isomer is most stable.
The QM/MM calculations predict an energy difference of 68 kJ/mol.
This is in agreement with the observation in the previous section
that the equatorial water molecule effectively dissociates when the
oxidized enzyme is reduced, providing a free coordinate site to the
O2 molecule. The point charges, representing the environment,
give a contribution of 15 kJ/mol (the difference between ΔEQM+ptch and ΔEQM). The electrostatic contribution from the protein is thus nonnegligible,
yet not very large. The contributions from the MM force field are
of a similar magnitude, but of an opposite sign, and accordingly,
the vacuum result (ΔEQM) is close
to the QM/MM result (ΔEQM/MM). We
additionally carried out a big-QM calculation that included all residues
within 5 Å of the active site. This gave an energy difference
of 77 kJ/mol with the def2-SV(P) basis set. An estimate of the effect
of increasing the basis set size to def2-TZVPP can be obtained from
the difference between def2-SV(P) and def2-TZVPP for the smaller QM
system. This effect is 11 kJ/mol, resulting in the total difference
of 88 kJ/mol, given in Table 3.

It should be noted that the protein significantly
influences the
structures. As for the resting states 1 and 2, previous computational studies on 3 imposed restrictions
during the structure optimization (by freezing selected atoms) to
mimic this protein effect. We compare both isomers with the previously
calculated results in Table 2, and in both cases, we find that the structures differ significantly.
In particular, we find large differences in the Cu–O distance
to Tyr175, although it is long in all structures (2.57–2.94
Å in our structures but 3.35–3.82 Å in the previous
studies; see refs (41) and (42)).

Both CuII and O2– have
one unpaired electron. These two electrons can either couple ferromagnetically
in a triplet state or antiferromagnetically in a singlet state. We
have studied both states, and it can be seen from Table 2 that the structures for the
two spin states are almost identical. The energy differences between
the two spin states are reported in the lower part of Table 3. For 3eq, the triplet is most stable. The energy difference is 13 kJ/mol,
both with the TPSS and with the B3LYP functionals, and the big-QM
result is only 2 kJ/mol lower. This is in reasonable agreement with
the 19 kJ/mol obtained in a previous study,41 which is remarkable considering the large differences in the obtained
structures.

For the axial isomer, the singlet–triplet
energy splittings
calculated with the QM region and a point-charge model of the environment
(ΔEQM+ptch) are 5 kJ/mol for TPSS
and 1 kJ/mol for B3LYP, which means that the two spin states are essentially
degenerate. In fact, adding the MM energy of −1 kJ/mol (giving
ΔEQM/MM) is enough to make the singlet
the ground state at the B3LYP level. Thus, it is not possible to settle
which of the two spin states is the most stable for the axial isomer
within the accuracy of current methods. Our spin-splitting energy
estimates for 3ax are somewhat lower than
the 19 kJ/mol that was obtained in the study by Kim et al.42

3 Discussion
The spectroscopic,
crystallographic, and computational studies
have suggested that the reduction of 1 to 2 is accompanied by a decrease in the coordination number of the Cu
atom. This is confirmed in our calculations, but the individual structures
for 1 and 2 are rather different from those
obtained in previous computational studies that have neglected the
protein environment. We can confirm a previous suggestion that a large
basis set is required before a significant bond elongation of the
axial water molecule (W229) is obtained. However, even with large
basis sets, we find that this water molecule is still weakly coordinated.
We also find large differences in our structures of 3 compared with the previous calculations on smaller active-site models.
Here, we highlight that 3eq is not 4-coordinate,
as has been suggested;5 instead, our structures
indicate that the axial water molecule remains coordinated to the
Cu ion, although with a rather long distance (2.24–2.46 Å),
the length of which is sensitive to the DFT method and the basis set
(see Table 2).

In most suggestions for the reaction mechanism of LPMOs, the substrate
has been hydroxylated at either C1 or C4,5,17,18,42 starting with
a hydrogen abstraction from the substrate. The Cu–superoxide
complex, [CuIIO2]+, is involved either
by directly abstracting a hydrogen atom from the substrate17,18 or as a precursor for an Cu–oxyl radical, which then abstracts
the hydrogen.42 The fact that the superoxide
can have both axial and equatorial isomers has not been considered
in any quantitative studies, although it was noted by Beeson et al.,5 who suggested that the axial isomer would be
unstable, based on a Jahn–Teller distortion argument. Our calculations
show that the axial isomer is stable, but they also confirm and quantify
that the axial isomer is significantly less stable than the equatorial
one (the difference is more than 60 kJ/mol). There are two sources
of stabilization of the equatorial isomer. One is that the equatorial
isomer is stabilized by interactions between the superoxide and the
second-coordination-sphere Gln173 residue (2.24 Å away), showing
a possible role for this highly conserved residue (see Figure 3). Another source is that the
equatorial coordination of O2– provides
a better possibility for π-interaction with the Cu 3d orbitals.
The orbitals involved for 3eq are shown in Figure 4, and more extensive
molecular orbital plots for 3eq and 3ax are shown in Figures S1 and S2. From these figures, it can be seen that stabilizing
dπ–Oπ interactions are completely
absent for 3ax.

Mechanistic insights
have so far been hampered by the lack of crystal
structures including a bound substrate, which is difficult to obtain
owing to the low solubility of cellulose and chitin. However, very
recently, LPMOs that target smaller (soluble) oligosaccharides as
substrates have been discovered, and a crystal structure for a (C4-specific)
LPMO complexed with cellotriose and cellohexose have been reported.56 In the LPMO–oligosaccharide complex,
a Cl– ion occupies the equatorial binding site,
and it is suggested that this is the binding site of O2, in agreement with our results. However, note that the LPMO reported
in ref (56) has a rather
different protein scaffold compared with that of the protein investigated
here, and the inclusion of substrate, therefore, cannot be carried
out by simple means (e.g., overlaying Cα-atoms).
In this study, we have rather employed a protein that is either identical
or bears close resemblance to those used in previous computational
studies, and we can thus more directly compare the computational approaches.
The large differences in the obtained structures compared with those
from previous computations strongly indicate that an inclusion of
the protein matrix is pivotal. Although the binding of the substrate
may affect the active site, the large energy difference between axial
and equatorial isomers found here indicates that the equatorial superoxide
adduct is the active species or a precursor. Finally, we should emphasize
that we cannot at the present state rule out that the active species
is a Cu–oxyl complex as suggested in ref (42).

4 Conclusions
We have presented the first QM/MM calculations on an LPMO enzyme,
based on the AA9 enzyme from Thermoascus aurantiacus. We investigated the resting state (1), its reduced
form (2), and the Cu–superoxide complex (3). For all intermediates, the calculated structures are significantly
different from those obtained in previous computational studies, where
the protein environment was neglected. For 3, there exist
two possible isomers, and in this study, we have found that one of
these (with an equatorial O2– ligand)
is much more stable than the other (more than 60 kJ/mol). Our further
studies on the LPMO mechanism will therefore focus on this intermediate
or intermediates derived from this one. Moreover, our future studies
will also include the LPMO–substrate complexes, employing the
same QM/MM computational protocol employed here. This will allow us
to investigate the reactivity of both the superoxide intermediate
(3) and Cu–oxyl complexes.

5 Computational
Methods
5.1 Protein Setup
The starting coordinates
were taken from the 1.5 Å resolution X-ray structure from Thermoascus aurantiacus, which belongs to the fungal
LPMO (type 3) family.5,8 This structure shows the protein
in the resting state, possibly with a partly reduced active-site Cu
ion. The structure is deposited in the protein data bank (2YET) and was also employed
in a previous computational study.42 The
structure is a dimer that contains 462 amino acids and 625 crystal
water molecules, amounting to 4199 atoms in total. Here, we consider
only the monomer (chain A), and the remainder of this paper always
refers to chain A, unless explicitly specified.

The crystal
structure contains eight amino acids with alternative conformations,
namely Asp10, Met25, Ser26, Asn27, Leu41, Ser117, Gln167, and Lys214.
We selected the conformation with the highest occupation or the first
conformation if they had the same occupation numbers. Hydrogen atoms
were added using the Maestro protein preparation tools.60 For the titratable residues (2 arginine, 5 lysine,
7 histidine, 14 aspartate, and 5 glutamate residues), the Maestro
program employs the PROPKA program61 to
estimate pKa values. The individual residues
were visually inspected, and their solvent exposure and hydrogen-bond
network were assessed. In this study, all arginine and lysine were
protonated (+1), whereas the aspartate and glutamate residues were
in their carboxylate forms (−1).

The histidine residues
have two possible protonation sites, and
in the following, we denote histidines as HIE (Nε2 protonated), HID (Nδ1 protonated), or HIP (both
nitrogens protonated). The first (N-terminal) histidine is a special
case because the imidazole ring is methylated on the Nε2 atom, whereas Nδ1 coordinates to the Cu ion. For
the remaining histidine residues, we employed the protonation states
HIE57, HID86, HIP87, HID158, HIP164, and HIP201. The Nδ1 atom of HIE57 receives a hydrogen bond from the backbone NH group
of Arg58, HID86 coordinates to Cu through Nε2, and
HIP87 forms a salt bridge from Hδ1 to the carboxylate
group of Asp132 and a hydrogen bond to a crystal water through Hε2. HID158 forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen
of Asn92 through Hδ1, whereas the Nε2 atom accepts a hydrogen bond from the side-chain indole NH group
of Trp79. HIP164 and HIP201 are solvent-exposed on the surface of
the protein. With this charge assignment, the total charge of the
protein in the resting state (1) was −7.

The protein contains four cysteine residues that are cross-linked
by disulfide bridges in the pairs Cys56–Cys178 and Cys97–Cys101.
The carboxy-terminal residue Gly228 was missing from the X-ray analysis
and was left out from the calculations. The X-ray structure contained
one glycerol and four acetate molecules, which were all removed.

5.2 RESP Charges
Restrained electrostatic
potential (RESP) charges for the metal center and its first coordination
sphere were obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potential (ESP).
The employed structure was taken from the protein (see Figure 5); it includes all ligands
coordinating to the Cu ion in any of the studied complexes, and only
hydrogen atoms were optimized, employing the TPSS functional62 together with a def2-SV(P) basis set.63,64 All calculations in this section were carried out with a development
version of Turbomole 7.065 (modified to
write the ESP points). The ESP points were sampled using Merz–Kollman
scheme,66,67 using default radii for all atoms67 and 2.0 Å for Cu.68 They were employed by the resp program (a part of the Amber69 package) to calculate the RESP charges.

Figure 5 Structure used
to obtain RESP charges for 1.

5.3 Equilibration
The system described
in section 5.1 was
equilibrated by simulated annealing using the Amber69 software. The protein was immersed in a sphere of TIP3P
water molecules with a radius of 40 Å, generated by the tLeAP
program in the Amber suite. Heavy atoms in the protein and crystal
water molecules were kept fixed at their crystal-structure positions.
During the first 200 ps, the system was heated up to 370 K. This was
followed by cooling from 370 to 0 K over 400 ps. The temperature was
regulated using the Berendsen thermostat,70 using a time constant that varied during the simulation: 0.2 ps
during the first 200 ps, 1.0 ps during the next 200 ps, 0.5 ps during
the following 100 ps, and 0.05 ps during the last 100 ps, leading
to a total simulation time of 600 ps. The simulations used a time
step of 0.5 fs. Finally, the system was subjected to a 10 000-step
minimization.

5.4 QM/MM Calculations
The equilibrated
system (section 5.3) was employed in the QM/MM calculations, employing the ComQum program.71,72 This program combines the QM software Turbomole 7.065 and the MM program Amber 14.69 In ComQum, the simulated system is divided into three subsystems,
labeled systems 1, 2, and 3. System 1 is described using a QM method
(here, DFT). Systems 2 and 3 are both described using an MM force
field. System 2 is defined as all atoms within 6 Å of any atom
in system 1. In the following, we use the label “free”
for calculations in which the coordinates of the atoms in system 2
are optimized. In calculations labeled “fixed”, these
are kept fixed. System 3 contains the remaining protein and solvent
atoms and is always kept fixed at the equilibrated structure. When
there is a bond between systems 1 and 2 (a junction), the hydrogen
link-atom approach was employed: the QM region is capped with hydrogen
atoms (hydrogen link atoms), the positions of which are linearly related
to the corresponding carbon atoms (carbon link atoms) in the full
system.73,74

The total energy of the system is
calculated as 1  EQM+ptch is the
QM energy of system 1, including hydrogen link atoms and a point-charge
model of systems 2 and 3 (with point charges taken from the Amber
force field and excluding only the carbon link atoms).44EMM123 is the total
MM energy of the full system (but with the charges of the QM system
zeroed), and EMM1 is the MM energy of
system 1 (still with zeroed charges).

In our study, we focused
on the three states 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 1. For 3, we considered two possible
isomers with the superoxide ion binding in either the axial or the
equatorial position, denoted as 3ax and 3eq. Both isomers of 3 may attain
either a triplet state or an antiferromagnetically coupled (open-shell)
singlet state. The latter was calculated to be a broken-symmetry state.75

The QM region always included the first
coordination sphere, that
is, the imidazole ring of His86 and the phenol ring of Tyr175, both
capped with a hydrogen atom (replacing Cα). The whole
terminal histidine residue and parts of the next amino-acid (Gly2;
junction at the carbonyl C atom) were included. The QM regions are
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 The QM systems employed for 1, 3ax, and 3eq. Model 2 employed
the same QM system as 1 (but with a reduced copper ion),
and the same QM system is employed for triplet and singlet variants
of 3.

For both isomers of 3, we included two solvent molecules
in the QM region, in addition to the water molecule coordinating to
CuII. This decision was made based on initial calculations,
in which they were absent. The initial calculations showed that the
energy difference between the isomers was dominated by van der Waals
energy from the MM calculations (amounting to over 80 kJ/mol). By
decomposing the energy into contributions from individual residues,
it was shown that the large change in the van der Waals energy was
almost exclusively caused by the two solvent water molecules. To shift
this large energy contribution to the more accurate QM part of the
energy, we decided to include these two solvent molecules in the QM
system. As expected, this lowered the energy change associated with
the MM part to around 17 kJ/mol.

In our initial setup, we noted
that the side chain of Gln173 was
flipped by the Maestro preparation tools. It was located in the second
coordination sphere at the hydrogen-bonding distance of both Tyr175
and one of the Cu-bound water molecules (2.7–2.8 Å distance
between the heavy atoms). Therefore, we decided to perform an optimization
both in the flipped (1a) and original (1b) conformations. The latter conformation was employed in the study
by Kim et al.,42 which was performed in
vacuum, but included parts of the second coordination sphere. In conformation 1b and the crystal structure, the side-chain carbonyl group
of Gln173 can receive a hydrogen bond from the Tyr175 OH group and
another from the Cu-bound water molecule. In the other conformation,
the side-chain NH2 group instead donates a hydrogen bond
to Tyr175, but it cannot donate any hydrogen bond to the water molecule.
Therefore, 1b is favored by about 30 kJ/mol, even when
calculated on a structure equilibrated for the 1a state
where the hydrogen bonding networks around the Gln173 NH2 group are somewhat unfavorable for 1b. We will, therefore,
focus on the conformation in 1b from this point on. To
ensure that the hydrogen network around the Gln173 NH2 was
sufficiently relaxed, the structure was re-equilibrated, and the QM/MM
optimization of 1 was carried out from this re-equilibrated
structure. The starting structures for 2 and 3 were built from 1, by reducing the charge of the QM
region (2) and replacing W229 (3ax) or W230 (3eq) with O2.

The structure optimizations employed the def2-SV(P) basis set63,64 and the dispersion-corrected TPSS-D3 functional62,76 with Becke–Johnson damping.77 All
reported energies were obtained from these structures by single-point
calculations with the more accurate def2-TZVPP basis set63 and including the entire protein (systems 2 and 3), represented by point charges (the effect
of increasing the basis set is usually around 1 kJ/mol for energy
differences). In the case of 3, we also tried the B3LYP/def2-TZVPP
combination (with the same structures). It was previously emphasized
that basis sets of at least triple-zeta quality are required to model
the structure of 2.41 For
states 1, 2, and 3eq, we, therefore, probed the quality of the TPSS-D3/def2-SV(P) structures
by increasing the basis set to def2-TZVPD or replacing the TPSS-D3
functional with B3LYP-D3.78−80 For both 1 and 2, the basis-set effect was significant for the Cu–O
bonds (as discussed in more detail in section 2). For 3, the effect is smaller,
and here the def2-SV(P) basis set is sufficient to obtain reliable
QM/MM structures.

It should be emphasized that the relaxation
of system 2 was found
to have a significant influence on the obtained structure, also within
the first coordination sphere. Consequently, we have, in general focused
on the results obtained with a relaxed system 2. The effect of relaxing
system 2 will shortly be discussed for intermediates 1 and 2 in section 2.1. Otherwise, results with a fixed system 2 are included
in the tables for comparison but not thoroughly discussed.

5.5 Big-QM Calculations
The use of a
point-charge model for the environment can be somewhat inaccurate
and for other metalloenzymes, it has been advocated to improve the
QM/MM energies with single-point energy calculations with larger QM
systems based on the QM/MM optimized structures.45,46 Following refs (45) and (46), we have,
therefore, defined a large QM system composed of all residues within
5.0 Å of the active site, as shown in Figure 1. In addition, junctions were moved at least
three residues away from the active site and we included the only
two buried charged residues in the protein, Arg157 and Glu159, which
form a salt bridge, rather close to the active site (Glu159 was actually
included already with the 5 Å criterion). The total system had
a charge of +3 and was composed of 628 atoms. Around this system,
we employed a conductorlike screening model (COSMO)81 with a dielectric constant of ε = 4.0. The calculations
employed the TPSS method and the def2-SV(P) basis set, based on the
structures obtained with the same specifications (note that this is
sufficient for 3, as described in the previous section).
The big-QM energy was enhanced with a DFT-D3 dispersion correction,
calculated for the same big-QM region with Becke–Johnson damping,
third-order terms, and default parameters for the TPSS functional.
Finally, the energies were extrapolated to the def2-TZVPP basis set
using two QM calculations on the normal QM system.
