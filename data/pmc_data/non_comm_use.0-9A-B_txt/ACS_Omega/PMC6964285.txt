Bacterial infections
pose a major threat to human health,
primarily because of the evolution of mutated strains that are resistant
to antibiotic treatment. As a viable alternative, several nanoparticles
have emerged as attractive antibacterial agents. Herein, we report
the development of iron sulfide (FeS) nanoparticles that show dual-modality
therapy: namely reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced toxicity and
red-laser induced photothermal therapy. The aqueous synthesized nanoparticles
have been characterized based on their size, shape, crystallinity,
and magnetic and optical properties. These nanoparticles showed sustained
release of Fe2+ ions in an aqueous dispersion. They also
have a high absorption cross-section in the visible and near infra-red
regions and could be excited by a continuous wave diode laser of wavelength
635 nm leading to significant hyperthermia. Nanoparticle treatment,
followed by light irradiation, led to significant cell death in two
ghastly pathogenic bacterial strains. Stepwise enhancement of intrabacterial
ROS levels, as a result of nanoparticle treatment followed by light
activation, has been identified as the primary antibacterial mechanism.

1 Introduction
It
is well known that
traditional antibiotics have limited utility in the treatment of bacterial
diseases/infections owing to the development of several mutated, antibiotic-resistant
strains.1−4 Therefore, alternative strategies are being channelized
for treating deadly pathogens. Several metal-based nanoparticles have
emerged as a new generation of antibacterial agents due not only to
their inherent properties, but also their ability to act as carriers
of antibiotics. These include nanoparticles of noble metals (e.g.
gold and silver) and their alloys, oxides (e.g. iron oxide and titania),
metal chalcogenides (e.g. MoS2), and so forth.5−20 Although each nanomaterial has its own mode of action, two general
antibacterial strategies from them have been identified, which may
act separately or in combination. The first modality involves the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the oxidation of
free metal ions.21,22 This occurs as a result of slow
degradation of the nanoparticle matrix in biological fluids. The other
modality involves localized heat-generation (hyperthermia) as a result
of exposure of the nanoparticles to external stimuli, such as light
or a magnetic field. This happens as a result of non-radiative relaxation
or hysteresis loss of nanoparticles following their excitation with
light or a magnetic field, respectively.23−25 Among these,
light-activation has emerged
as the better strategy owing to its easy availability and simple mode
of exposure.

Iron-containing oxides and chalcogenides represent
an important family of nanomaterials and have extensively been used
in various biomedical applications, such as antimicrobial action,
magnetically guided drug delivery, contrast enhancement in MRI, ac
magnetic field induced hyperthermia therapy, and so forth.25−32 They are also easy to
synthesize and, in general, are found to be safe for biomedical applications.
Not only do they have unique magnetic properties (e.g. ferromagnetic,
superparamagnetic, etc.), but they also exhibit attractive optical
absorption covering the visible and near infra-red (NIR) region. As
a result, they are also emerging as efficient nanomaterials for photothermal
therapy (PTT), which has applications in treating cancer and inflammatory
and microbial diseases. PTT is known to inflict physical damage on
the bacterial cells when light-absorbing nanoparticles selectively
adsorbed on the surface of bacteria are photo-irradiated.33 The resulting local hyperthermia leads to the
formation of heat bubbles which destroy the cell wall, followed by
bacterial cell death.34 By confining light
irradiation to the diseased/infected region pretreated with the nanoparticles,
damage to normal cells/tissues can be avoided. The other advantage
of PTT is that bacterial cells are not yet known to be resistant to
photothermal damage.

Keeping the above facts in mind, we have
prepared stable, aqueous-dispersed iron-sulfide (FeS) nanoparticles
and have investigated their antibacterial effects. These nanoparticles
have been synthesized by the co-precipitation approach using ferric
chloride in the presence of sodium dithionite and sodium borohydride
as the reducing agent. We have extensively characterized these nanoparticles
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction
(SAED), which clearly reveal their spherical and crystalline nature.
Their optical and magnetic properties have been ascertained by using
UV–visible spectrophotometry and vibrating sample magnetometry
(VSM), respectively. Next we have explored the combined dual-modality
antibacterial therapy involving these nanoparticles in an aqueous
dispersion via (a) production of ROS as a result of oxidation of the
liberated Fe2+ ions21,22 and (b) laser light
activated localized hyperthermia. The aqueous dispersion of these
nanoparticles upon exposure to red laser light showed a significant
rise in temperature and subsequent robust bacterial damage, which
make them suitable agents for photothermal applications.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials Used
Ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O), sodium dithionite
(Na2S2O4), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), ammonia
solution (25%), dimethyl sulfoxide, ammonia acetate, ethanol, methanol,
concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), and l-ascorbic acid
were purchased from Merck. Ferrozine reagent, phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), Triton-X100, neocuproine, fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, iodonitrotetrazolium salt (INT), amphotericin-B,
glucose, and penicillin–streptomycin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2 Synthesis of FeS Nanoparticles
FeS
nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile chemical precipitation
method using iron chloride (FeCl3·3H2O)
as the iron source and sodium dithionite as the sulfur source. The
traditional reducing agent sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was
used for reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. Briefly,
1 g sodium dithionite was dissolved in 1 L of 1 M aqueous NaBH4 solution. The resulting solution was added drop-wise to a
1 M FeCl3·3H2O aqueous solution in a volume
ratio of 1:1. The solution was decanted to remove the unreacted reactants
and side products. The precipitate was thoroughly washed with water
and ethanol to purify the nanoparticles. The synthesized FeS nanoparticles
were further dried in an oven in the absence of air for 24 h and used
for further studies.

2.3 Characterization of FeS
Nanoparticles
The as-synthesized FeS nanoparticles were characterized
based on
their size and morphology. Their size and morphology were observed
by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method using a Malvern Zetasizer
(NANO ZS series), TEM using a TECNAI G2-30 U-TWIN TEM instrument,
and SEM using a MIRA3 TESCAN instrument. Powder XRD analysis using
a Bruker D8 Discovery X-ray spectrometer and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) using a TECNAI G2-30 U-TWIN TEM instrument
were carried out to confirm the crystalline nature of the nanoparticles.
The optical properties of aqueous dispersed FeS nanoparticles (conc.
0.75 g/mL) were monitored by UV–visible spectroscopy using
a Shimadzu UV-1601 Spectrophotometer. Their magnetic properties were
observed by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) using a Microsense
EV-7 instrument.

2.4 Temperature Rise (Hyperthermia)
Experiment
This experiment was performed by taking various
aqueous dispersions
of FeS nanoparticles in a 3 mL glass vial, followed by light irradiation
with a continuous wave (CW) laser emitting at a wavelength of 635
nm for a maximum time of 30 min. The time-dependent rise in temperature
in the dispersions, as a result of photo-induced hyperthermia, was
recorded using a digital probe thermometer at regular time-intervals
of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min. PBS was used as the blank solution
(negative control) in this experiment.

2.5 In Situ
Fe2+ Release
The
time-dependent cumulative release of Fe2+ ions from the
aqueous dispersion of FeS nanoparticles was ascertained by the ferrozine
reagent assay.35 Ferrozine reagent is a
mixture of four chemicals, namely aqueous solutions of 2,9-dimethyl
(1,10-phenanthroline), or neocuproine (6.5 mM), 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(phenylsulfonic
acid)-1,2,4-triazine, or ferrozine (6.5 mM), ammonium acetate (2.5
M) and l-ascorbic acid (1 M). Ascorbic acid is used to convert
any Fe3+ ions into Fe2+ ions. Freshly prepared
ferrozine reagent (colorless) reacts with Fe2+ ions to
yield a magenta colored solution with an absorption maximum at 562
nm. A fixed concentration of FeS nanoparticles in water (200 μg/mL)
was distributed in different vials (1 mL each) and incubated at 37
°C for different time intervals (daily for 7 days). PBS was used
as the negative control. Each sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm
for 5 min and the optically clear filtrate was decanted. Then the
filtrate from each vial was treated with 100 μL of ferrozine
reagent and incubated for 30 min, and the optical density (OD) of
the resulting solution was measured spectrophotometrically at 562
nm. A higher OD corresponds to a higher Fe2+ ion concentration
in the solution. The exact amount of Fe2+ ions released
in each sample was then determined from a calibration curve obtained
using the ferrozine assay with known concentrations of Fe2+ ions (aqueous solution of FeCl3). A plot was made between
Fe2+ concentration (in μM) and number of days of
incubation of the aqueous FeS dispersion.

2.6 Bacterial
Culture and Antibacterial Studies
The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 740) {Gram (+)} and Pseudomonas aeruginosa {Gram (−)} were grown
in Mueller Hinton broth growth medium
at an optimum temperature of 37 °C.

A broth microdilution
assay in sterile 24 well cell-culture plates was performed to estimate
the antibacterial efficacy of the nanoparticles (using Milli-Q water).
The bacterial cells in the cell-culture wells were treated with the
aqueous dispersion of the FeS nanoparticles (500 μg/mL, sterile
filtered with a Millipore Filter, cut-off size 0.22 μm) and
mixed well. Cells treated with only Milli-Q water were used as the
negative control. To analyze the photothermal effect, half of the
treated bacterial cell wells were irradiated with a diode laser emitting
at 635 nm, by focusing the laser beam vertically downward on a particular
well for a duration of 7 min each. After the light treatment, the
plates were kept in an incubator shaker at 37 °C. After incubation
for specific intervals of time (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h), 100
μL of the growth indicator INT 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-2H-tetrazolium, or INT dye reagent (0.25 mg/mL), were added
to each bacterial well and mixed and the cells were further incubated
for 30 min. INT upon reduction by live bacteria produces pink formazan
dye, with an absorption maximum at 570 nm.36 Therefore, the OD at 570 nm directly correlates with the bacterial
growth. The absorption measured at 570 nm for samples from each well
was then plotted as a function of time, to analyze the time-dependent
bacterial growth upon nanoparticle treatment, without and with light
exposure.

2.7 Colony Count Assay
The S. aureus strain grown in LB medium was treated
with 500 μg mL–1 FeS nanoparticles, with and
without laser irradiation, in a 24 well plate (NUNC) overnight at
37 °C in an orbital shaker at 180 rpm. On the second day, it
was diluted serially to 10–4 in fresh LB medium
and 100 μL of this dilution was plated on LB agar plates. The
plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h and the colonies were
counted manually and used in the equation below.37  

2.8 Interaction
of FeS Nanoparticles with Bacterial
Cells via TEM Study
The interaction of FeS nanoparticles
with bacterial cells was confirmed by TEM analysis. FeS nanoparticles
(1 mg/mL) were incubated with Bacillus cereus (fresh culture) for 1 h at 37 °C. After this, the culture was
centrifuged and the bacterial cell pellet obtained was rinsed thoroughly
with PBS. Then this pellet was fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% solution)
and kept at 4 °C for the whole night. Then it was centrifuged
and the pellet thus obtained was thoroughly washed with PBS. Next,
it was sequentially dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethyl
alcohol such as 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%. The pellet finally obtained
was again resuspended in PBS solution and mounted on a TEM grid for
analysis.

2.9 ROS Generation Assay
Generation of
hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS was measured using 2,7-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA), a fluorogenic dye. For ROS detection, S. aureus was treated without and with FeS NPs (0.5
and 1 mg/mL) and incubated for 5 h. Later it was centrifuged and washed
with PBS. The pellet was incubated with dye (50 μM) for 30 min
at 37 °C. The fluorescence of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
was measured using a TECAN Multimode Microplate Reader at excitation:
485 nm and emission: 525 nm. The results were expressed in relative
fluorescence units.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization Studies
In this
study, we have synthesized FeS nanoparticles by a simple micellar
approach using ferric chloride (FeCl3·3H2O) and sodium dithionite, with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent. The iron precursor and the dithionite were
used in a 1:1 ratio and NaBH4 was added in a small amount
and heated at 120 °C for 8–10 h. After the completion
of the reaction a dark brown precipitate of FeS nanoparticles was
obtained, which was used for further studies. We first recorded the
hydrodynamic size of the synthesized nanoparticles using DLS, which
yielded an average hydrodynamic diameter of 102 nm (Figure 1A). The hydrodynamic diameter
takes into account the hydration layer around the nanoparticles, and
hence it is always higher than the actual size. The actual grain size
of the nanoparticles was obtained using TEM, which showed an approximate
size range of 60–80 nm (Figure 1B). SEM images of FeS nanoparticles provided additional
insight into their structure, shape and surface morphology (Figure 1C). Here, FeS nanoparticles
exhibited quasi-spherical morphology with an average grain size of
70 nm.

(B) TEM micrograph (scale bar = 200 nm), and (C) field emission SEM
image (scale bar = 0.5 μm) of FeS nanoparticles.

Powder XRD data revealed that the synthesized FeS nanoparticles
are crystalline in nature (Figure 2A). On comparing this data with the corresponding XRD
pattern of pure tetragonal phase FeS nanoparticles (JCPDS card no.
860389), it was evident that there was a good agreement between the
observed peaks, namely (101), (110), (102), (201), and (213).38 In the selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern of the nanoparticles, the bright spotted area and concentric
rings confirmed their crystallinity (Figure 2B). These observations were in accordance
with the XRD pattern obtained for the nanoparticles. The concentric
rings observed can be correlated with the (110), (102), (201), and
(113) diffraction peaks.38

FeS nanoparticles showing
sharp peaks, indicating the crystalline nature of nanoparticles. The
overlay pattern below shows the standard tetragonal phase FeS nanoparticles.
(B) SAED pattern of the nanoparticles, confirming their crystalline
nature.

The magnetic
behavior of the nanoparticles was elucidated by using a vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM). The observed magnetization curve (Figure 3A) shows that the
synthesized FeS nanoparticles were ferromagnetic (Figure 3A, inset) in nature and might
behave like soft magnets. Soft magnets are those materials which show
high magnetic permeability and low coercivity.39 Iron based nanoparticles are used widely as soft magnetic
materials and these particles attain magnetic saturation in a relatively
low applied magnetic field. Although we have not exploited the magnetic
properties of these nanomaterials for antibacterial action in this
work, magnetic targeting as well as magnetic hyperthermia are nevertheless
attractive antibacterial strategies which have not yet been completely
explored.

UV–visible spectrum of FeS nanoparticles (0.75 mg/mL). (C)
Temperature rise (hyperthermia) pattern of aqueous dispersed FeS nanoparticles
as a function of time of irradiation with CW laser light (wavelength
635 nm).

Then, the optical properties of
FeS nanoparticles
were monitored by UV–visible spectroscopy. In the recorded
spectrum (Figure 3B),
it was evident that the FeS nanoparticles showed a broad absorption
in the visible region (400–700 nm). This property makes them
a suitable photothermal agent for broad visible light excitation.
We tested their photothermal (light-excited heating effect) efficiency
by irradiating aqueous dispersions of these nanoparticles at various
concentrations (0.125 and 0.75 mg/mL) with continuous-wave laser light
of wavelength 635 nm (power density 20 W/cm2). A significant
rise in the temperature from 32 °C to a maximum of 58 °C
was observed after 30 min of light irradiation (Figure 3C). This experiment showed that the FeS nanoparticles
can act as good photothermal agents following visible light excitation,
which can be applied for anticancer or antibacterial hyperthermia
therapies.40

Next, we tested the
time-dependent release of Fe2+ ions from the aqueous dispersion
of FeS nanoparticles (200 μg/mL) using the ferrozine assay,
as described earlier. As shown in Figure 4, Fe2+ ions are found to be released
in solution in a time-dependent manner, with an initial burst release
followed by a steady release. This release is attributed to partial
surface erosion of the nanoparticles. The released Fe2+ ions have been reported to be responsible for the production of
various ROS under oxic conditions.41

Figure 4 Time dependent
release of Fe2+ ions from aqueous
dispersed FeS nanoparticles (200 μg/mL), estimated spectrophotometrically
using the ferrozine assay.

As discussed earlier, a promising antibacterial strategy is photo-induced
hyperthermia, which involves localized heating of the bacterial surface
as a result of light-irradiation of certain nanoparticles accumulated
on the surface of the bacteria. We first ascertained the interaction
of the nanoparticles with the bacterial cell surface using TEM (Supporting Information S1). FeS nanoparticles
are robust visible/NIR light induced photothermal agents and thus
promising transducers for antibacterial hyperthermia therapy. As shown
in Figure 5A,B, it
was evident in both the bacterial cultures (SA and PA) that while
untreated bacteria shows ample growth, the growth is highly suppressed
for the bacteria treated with the FeS nanoparticles. This effect can
be termed as “bacteriostatic”, where bacterial growth
is greatly reduced, although some remnant viable cells remain. On
the other hand, near-complete suppression of bacterial growth was
observed when the nanoparticle-treated bacteria were exposed to laser
light, which can be termed as “bactericidal” owing to
the death of bacteria.42 The bacteriostatic
effect of the FeS nanoparticles (no light exposure) can be attributed
to the attachment of the nanoparticles to the bacterial surface and
local production of ROS, thus stifling their cell division and growth.
When the nanoparticle-attached bacteria were exposed to light, photo-induced
hyperthermia was further responsible for the death of the bacterial
cells. This experiment directly proves the effect of the antibacterial
visible-light induced photothermal effect of FeS nanoparticles. The
antibacterial effect of the nanoparticles, in combination with light
irradiation, is further confirmed by a colony counting assay (Supporting Information S2). The nanoparticles
did not show any appreciable toxicity upon interaction with normal
mammalian fibroblast cells in culture (Supporting Information S3), indicating their general biocompatibility.

aureus (SA), and (B) Gram (−),
that is Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA),
bacteria treated with a 500 μg/mL aqueous dispersion of FeS
nanoparticles, with and without light (hν)
exposure.

Finally, we probed the intra-bacterial
ROS production using the
DCFH-DA assay by comparing the ROS generated by the bacteria without
and with nanoparticles as well as light treatment. We have used DCFH-DA
in our study as it can detect a broad spectrum of ROS species, like
hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, super oxide, and hydrogen peroxide.
In Figure 6, substantial
enhancement in intra-bacterial ROS can be observed upon treatment
of the cells with the nanoparticles. The ROS levels further increase
with light irradiation of the treated cells. This enhancement in ROS
upon nanoparticle treatment and light activation directly correlated
with their antibacterial properties, implying that ROS enhancement
is the primary mechanism in the killing of bacterial cells.43

treated with various concentrations of FeS NPs (0, 0.5, and 1 mg/mL),
without (dark) and with (light) laser irradiation.

4 Conclusions
FeS nanoparticles have
been synthesized by using a simple aqueous co-precipitation method.
A broad absorption pattern of these aqueous dispersed nanoparticles
was obtained in the visible region; subsequent irradiation with laser
light emitting at 635 nm led to an increase in temperature (up to
25 °C) owing to photo-induced hyperthermia. Time-dependent release
of Fe2+ ions was observed from these aqueous dispersed
nanoparticles. Their dual-modality antibacterial effect was observed
in both Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains, owing to
(a) the bacteriostatic effect due to the produced ROS and (b) the
bactericidal effect due to photo-induced hyperthermia. Stepwise enhancement
in intra-bacterial ROS levels, as a result of nanoparticle treatment
followed by light activation, has been identified as the primary antibacterial
mechanism. Such new antibacterial approaches have the potential to
replace traditional antibiotic based approaches.
