Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a polymorphic
enzyme involved in the metabolism and inactivation of thiopurine substances
administered as immunosuppressants in the treatment of malignancies
and autoimmune diseases. In this study, the naturally occurring variants,
TPMT*6 (Y180F) and TPMT*8 (R215H), have been biophysically characterized.
Despite being classified as low and intermediate in vivo enzyme activity
variants, respectively, our results demonstrate a discrepancy because
both TPMT*6 and TPMT*8 were found to exhibit normal functionality
in vitro. While TPMT*8 exhibited biophysical properties almost indistinguishable
from those of TPMTwt, the TPMT*6 variant was found to be destabilized.
Furthermore, the contributions of the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) to the thermodynamic stability of TPMT were investigated, but
only a modest stabilizing effect was observed. Also presented herein
is a new method for studies of the biophysical characteristics of
TPMT and its variants using the extrinsic fluorescent probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic
acid (ANS). ANS was found to bind strongly to all investigated TPMT
variants with a Kd of approximately 0.2
μM and a 1:1 binding ratio as determined by isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC). Circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements
showed that ANS binds exclusively to the native state of TPMT, and
binding to the active site was confirmed by molecular modeling and
simulated docking as well as ITC measurements. The strong binding
of the probe to native TPMT and the conformity of the obtained results
demonstrate the advantages of using ANS binding characteristics in
studies of this protein and its variants.

==== Body
Introduction
Thiopurine S-methyltransferase
(TPMT) (E.C. 2.1.1.67)
is an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent cytosolic
enzyme primarily known for its key role in the metabolism of thiopurines,
such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), used as immunosuppressants administered
in the treatment of malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Thiopurines
are prodrugs that require metabolic activation through a series of
intracellular reactions to generate cytotoxic metabolites, thioguanine
nucleotides (TGNs). TGNs are nucleotide analogues that are incorporated
into the DNA and RNA of the cell, which ultimately cause apoptosis.
While the natural substrate of TPMT is not known, the enzyme complicates
the metabolism of thiopurines by methylating their metabolic intermediates.
As the methylated product can no longer be incorporated into DNA and
RNA, the administered dosage of thiopurine drugs is adjusted to account
for partial TPMT inactivation. However, TPMT is a polymorphic enzyme
with more than 40 naturally occurring variants identified so far,1 most of which exhibit low or intermediate enzyme
activity toward thiopurine substrates; 1 out of 300 in a population
is homozygous with two nonfunctional TPMT alleles, resulting in no
detectable enzyme activity; 10% are heterozygous and exhibit intermediate
enzyme activity; and approximately 90% exhibit normal to high enzyme
activity.2,3 Administrating standard dosage to patients
carrying nonfunctional alleles puts them at the risk of developing
life-threatening toxicity by accumulation of high concentrations of
active TGNs (which could potentially cause myelosuppression). On the
other hand, high TPMT enzyme activity causes accumulation of the methylated
product, which could result in hepatotoxicity. Because of the complex
metabolism of thiopurines, their therapeutic index is very narrow.
To avoid severe side effects in patients, the individual genotype
and phenotype (TPMT enzyme activity) are routinely determined prior
to thiopurine administration to establish proper dosage. As a consequence
of routine genotyping and phenotyping, novel TPMT protein variants
are frequently discovered. Even though most of the variants exhibit
reduced enzyme activity toward thiopurine substrates, few studies
have investigated the molecular causes of decreased functionality.
In some cases, the reason for low enzyme activity has been shown to
be caused by decreased protein stability, faster proteasomal degradation,
autophagy, and aggregation,4,5 causing cellular protein
levels to decrease.6 However, discrepancies
between clinical and in vitro measured activities have been reported.
For example, the TPMT*31 variant (originally denoted TPMT*28) was
shown to exhibit normal enzymatic function in purified samples, although
the protein was found to be destabilized, causing in vivo degradation
and reduced enzyme activity owing to lowered protein levels.7 Generally, detailed biophysical studies on purified
samples of TPMT variants are scarce, and very few studies have determined
the molecular causes of decreased enzyme activity.8 Investigating and explaining the molecular reasons for
varying enzyme activities are important aspects in understanding the
consequences of single amino acid substitutions and their impact on
treatment efficacy and patient safety. Furthermore, studying variant
proteins not only generates information on the molecular causes of
altered functionality but also contributes knowledge of the stability,
function, and interactions of the TPMT protein and its role in clinical
treatment.

The publication of the high-resolution crystal structure
of human
TPMT in complex with its coproduct S-adenosylhomocysteine
(SAH) in 2007 has contributed greatly to further studies of this enzyme
and its variants.9 The molecular structure
revealed a plausible reaction mechanism, where the methyl group is
transferred from the cofactor SAM to the substrate through an SN2-type reaction. This mechanism was confirmed by cocrystallization
of the murine orthologue with SAH coproduct and 6-MP substrate,10 as well as QM/MM and molecular dynamics simulation.11,12 Although the mode of action toward thiopurines is well-established,
little is known about the natural function and substrate of TPMT.
It has been shown to bind a variety of substances and seems to have
a predisposition for binding heterocyclic compounds with carboxyl
and amine group substituents,13 and some
of these substances could interfere with the enzymatic function. For
instance, methotrexate has recently been shown to bind to wild-type
TPMT, affecting its enzyme activity toward 6-MP during clinical treatment.14 The drug furosemide has also been confirmed
as a clinically relevant inhibitor of TPMT.15,16 The two naturally occurring protein variants investigated in this
study, TPMT*6 (Y180F)17 and TPMT*8 (R215H),18 were discovered as variants with low and intermediate
in vivo enzyme activity, respectively. Kinetic measurements in mammalian
cells (using 6-MP or 6-TG as thiopurine substrates) have been reported,19,20 but studies on these protein variants are otherwise scarce. Both
mutation sites are situated in the central β-sheet of the protein
(Figure 1), relatively
far away from the active site, with Y180 completely buried within
the protein core. In the TPMT*6 variant protein, tyrosine 180 is substituted
to phenylalanine, a textbook example of a mutation frequently used
to investigate the thermodynamic contributions of single chemical
groups in proteins21 (Figure 2A). Arginine 215, on the other
hand, is located at the edge of the protein, facing the solvent (Figure 2B).

and stick representation (PDB ID: 2BZG).

(B) R215 (TPMT*8) (PDB ID: 2BZG).

Several novel TPMT variants7,20,22−24 are situated
in secondary structure elements adjacent
to R215 and have been reported to exhibit decreased in vivo enzyme
activity. Also, the mutation site of the low enzyme activity variant
TPMT*3C (Y240C) known to be destabilized and prone to aggregation4 is situated on the neighboring β-strand.
In this work, we have studied the biophysical properties of TPMT*6
(Y180F) and TPMT*8 (R215H). We have also studied the stabilizing effect
of the cofactor SAM and found only a minor contribution to the thermodynamic
stability of TPMT upon cofactor binding under our experimental conditions.
Furthermore, we have investigated the use of the extrinsic fluorescent
probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) as a tool for studying
the tertiary structure and stability of TPMT.

Results and Discussion
Functional
Characterization of TPMT*6 and TPMT*8
TPMT*6
(Y180F) and TPMT*8 (R215H) have been reported as low and intermediate
activity variants, respectively.17,18 Our measurements
on purified recombinant protein samples reveal that both of the investigated
variants are fully functional in vitro using 6-MP as the thiopurine
substrate. We have previously encountered discrepancies between in
vivo and in vitro measurements of TPMT enzyme activity, as we discovered
that the TPMT*31 variant (originally denoted *28) was enzymatically
functional but structurally destabilized and prone to aggregation.7 It has been demonstrated that for some TPMT variants,
the main cause of decreased protein levels is proteasomal degradation
through the ubiquitinylation pathway.3−6 Experiments using mammalian cells have shown
a correlation between enzyme activity and protein levels for a number
of TPMT variants (including TPMT*6 and TPMT*8),19,20 suggesting that nonfunctional or destabilized variant proteins are
recognized as defective by the quality control functions of the cells
and targeted for degradation. Because the TPMT variants in our study
proved to be functional in vitro, we investigated the structural properties
of these proteins to elucidate the possible reasons for decreased
in vivo enzyme activity.

Probing the Stability of the TPMT Secondary
Structure Using
Circular Dichroism
The far-UV CD spectra (Figure 3A) show similar shape and amplitude,
demonstrating that both TPMT*6 and TPMT*8 are able to assume the proper
fold identical to that of the wild-type protein at room temperature.
The interactions between TPMT and its cofactor SAM were also investigated
using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. SAM has recently been
shown to contribute favorably to the cellular stability of TPMT. Cells
starved of methionine (a precursor of SAM) exhibited reduced TPMT
enzyme activity and increased proteasomal degradation,25 effectively lowering cellular protein levels.
To elucidate if these effects are caused solely by the metabolic status
of the cell and the availability of SAM, or thermodynamic stabilization
of the protein–cofactor complex, we investigated the unfolding
of the TPMT secondary structure by monitoring the change in ellipticity
at 222 nm as a function of increased temperature. The resulting stability
curves displayed multiphasic transitions (Figure 3B). However, the transitions were treated
as a two-state transition model as previously done for TPMTwt as well
as other TPMT variants.4,8,26

circles (TPMTwt), open triangles (TPMT*6), and open squares (TPMT*8)

SAM (filled circles) and in the absence of SAM (open circles), (C)
thermal denaturation monitored by CD spectroscopy at 222 nm in the
presence of ANS, and (D) thermal denaturation monitored as ANS fluorescence
emission detected at 475 nm.

Results show only minor contributions to the overall stability
of TPMT upon SAM binding (Table 1). The unfolding of the protein was also investigated
in the presence of ANS and monitored as the change in ellipticity
at 222 nm as a function of increased temperature. The resulting stability
curves were assumed to obey a two-state transition model (Figure 3C). Addition of ANS
substantially stabilizes the secondary structure of the protein variants
investigated herein with an increased Tm values of 7.4, 7.2, and 5.0 °C for wild-type TPMT, TPMT*6,
and TPMT*8, respectively. The obtained Tm values in the presence of ANS are 53.8, 48.6, and 51.5 °C for
wild-type TPMT, TPMT*6, and TPMT*8, respectively (Table 1). Increased thermostability
indicates that ANS interacts preferably with the native state of TPMT,
stabilizing the protein and shifting the equilibrium toward the folded
state. The thermal unfolding of the investigated variants show that
the stability of TPMT*8 is comparable with that of the wild-type protein,
whereas the stability of TPMT*6 was found to be decreased, indicating
loss of stabilizing interactions within the protein.

Investigating the Stability of the TPMT Tertiary Structure
Even though TPMT contains five tryptophan residues, intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence is not a suitable tool for monitoring the unfolding of
the tertiary structure of this particular protein. Four out of five
tryptophan side-chains are solvent accessible, which precludes the
monitoring of shift in emission wavelengths as the changes when going
from one state to another are very small and cannot be reliably distinguished.
However, the fluorescent compound ANS has been shown to bind extensively
to the native state of the protein.8 ANS
is commonly used to study the conformational changes during protein
unfolding, but it is known to also bind to the native states of other
proteins.27−29 ANS has been proven useful in other cases where measuring
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is not feasible.30 To determine whether or not ANS is a suitable tool for
studying the TPMT tertiary structure, we investigated the interactions
between the protein and the probe. The unfolding of the protein was
also monitored as changes in ANS fluorescence as a function of increased
temperature (Figure 3D). A distinct thermal denaturation profile was observed for all
variants and interpreted as a two-state transition. The Tm value of TPMT*6 (49.6 °C) was found to be lower
than the Tm values of wild type and TPMT*8
(54.1 °C for both variants) (Table 1). ANS fluorescence intensity was the same
in the samples above denaturing temperature as in the reference buffer,
indicating no binding of ANS to the denatured state of the protein,
confirming preferential binding to the native state and dissociation
of ligand upon unfolding.

Characterization of SAM and ANS Binding to
TPMT
Characterization
of the binding of SAM and ANS to the investigated TPMT variants were
also studied using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Titration
of cofactor SAM to wild-type TPMT yielded an equilibrium dissociation
constant, Kd, of approximately 2 μM
(Figure 4A). Titration
of SAM to TPMT*6 and TPMT*8 exhibited similar affinities (Table 1), whereas titration
of ANS resulted in a dissociation constant, Kd, 10 times lower than that of SAM for TPMT wild-type (Figure 4B) as well as variant
proteins (Table 1).
For both SAM and ANS, the binding model established that only one
ligand molecule was bound per protein molecule.

SAM and (B) extrinsic fluorescent probe
ANS to TPMTwt monitored by ITC, showing the chemical structures of
the two ligands above their respective isotherm and resulting binding
curve.

Investigating the ANS Binding
Site
ANS has been shown
to interact with the adenosine binding sites of other nucleotide-dependent
proteins,31−33 and the structural similarities between ANS and the
cofactor SAM together with the experimental results showing binding
of ANS exclusively to the native state of TPMT (with a 1:1 ratio)
suggested that the probe might bind to the active site. To support
the experimental results, we simulated the docking of ANS to the crystal
structure of TPMT (PDB ID: 2BZG(9)) using AutoDock Vina.51 The best-modeled structures were all found to
colocalize with the cofactor binding site. The two best-modeled structures
(lowest ΔG) were used for a more detailed view
of putative interacting partners of TPMT. From the modeled data, two
obvious binding modes were obtained (Figure 5) with residue Trp29 or Ile91 as hydrogen
bonding partners of the phosphate moiety of ANS.

view of the two lowest energy structure
models of ANS and interaction partners of TPMT. The coproduct, SAH,
is shown in red. The dotted lines illustrate the putative interactions
between ANS and Trp29 and Ile91 of TPMT.

Y180 is Important for Stability
Our studies of the
naturally occurring protein variant TPMT*6 (Y180F) show that substitution
of tyrosine 180 to phenylalanine decreases the stability of the TPMT*6
variant protein relative to wild type. The TPMT*6 mutation site is
situated in the central β-sheet of the protein, completely buried
by flanking helices. Amino acid substitution causes removal of the
tyrosine side-chain OH-group that participates in a hydrogen bonding
network within the core of the wild-type protein.10 Hydrogen-bonded tyrosine OH-groups have been shown to make
substantial contributions to protein stability,34 and burial of polar groups has been demonstrated to contribute
more to stability than burial of nonpolar volume equivalents,35 explaining the dramatic effects of this type
of mutation on TPMT*6 protein stability. Furthermore, recent work
on the destabilized TPMT*23 (A167G) variant protein showed that substitution
of A167 to glycine distorts helix αG (residues 162–173),
which causes disruption of the interactions between Y166 and its hydrogen-bonding
partners D151 and Y180.36 Similarly, molecular
dynamics simulation suggests that mutation of A154 to threonine (TPMT*3B)
also disrupts the Y166–D151–Y180 hydrogen-bonding network,
causing rearrangement of helix αG (residues 162–173)
and destabilization of the TPMT*3B variant protein.37 Our studies of the TPMT*6 (Y180F) variant confirm that
the Y166–D151–Y180 hydrogen-bonding network is highly
sensitive to perturbations, which seem to inevitably cause destabilization
of the TPMT protein. Although the TPMT*6 protein assumes the proper
fold and exhibits normal functionality in vitro, the decreased stability
of this variant would likely lead to increased degradation and shortened
half-life in vivo, effectively lowering protein concentrations that
decreases the enzymatic activity toward thiopurine substrates. This
would explain the discrepancy in functionality observed for the TPMT*6
protein variant.

Biophysical Properties of TPMT*8 Identical
to Wild Type
The biophysical characteristics of the naturally
occurring variant
TPMT*8 (R215H) are virtually identical to the wild-type protein. R215
is not highly conserved; in fact, histidine occurs in several species
(Figure 6), and there
seems to be a preference for polar residues at this position equivalent.
The β-strand in which residue 215 is situated sits at the very
edge of the central sheet, facing the solvent, surrounded by predominantly
polar residues. Combined with the fact that polar residues seem to
be preferred at the position 215, it is possible that the very nature
of the substitution of TPMT*8 makes it structurally tolerable. Our
results clearly show that the structure and stability of this protein
are not affected by mutation, and the biophysical characteristics
of the TPMT*8 protein variant are identical to those of the wild-type
protein. Previous studies using mammalian cells have reported intermediate
TPMT*8 enzyme activity toward thiopurine substrates,18,19 but the discrepancy cannot be explained by reduced intrinsic stability
of the protein as this variant exhibits normal functionality in vitro.
We therefore conclude that the decreased TPMT*8 in vivo enzyme activity
cannot be explained by molecular causes and must be due to other mechanisms
beyond the scope of this study. Interestingly, several novel TPMT
variants, TPMT*20 (K238E),20,22 TPMT*25 (C212R),23 TPMT*26 (F208L),24 and TPMT*31 (I204T, originally denoted TPMT*28)7 situated in structural elements adjacent to R215 have been
reported with decreased in vivo enzyme activity. Of these variants,
TPMT*31 (I204T, originally denoted *28) exhibited biophysical characteristics
similar to TPMT*8. Additionally, Garat et al.23 demonstrated that TPMT has an inherent dipole moment and suggested
that the TPMT*25 (C212R) amino acid substitution disturbs the electrostatic
balance of the protein. It could be that this particular region of
the protein is sensitive to perturbations due to amino acid substitution,
rather than the nature of the mutations per se. It is possible that
TPMT variants exhibiting deviations in this structural region are
targeted by the quality control system of the cell, causing increased
clearance and shortened half-lives of these proteins. It remains to
be discovered if the variants mentioned above exhibit similar structural
and biophysical characteristics as TPMT*8.

β7 and β8 strands harboring the
mutation sites of TPMT*6 (Y180F) and TPMT*8 (R215H), respectively.
The obtained SIFT scores for TPMT*6 (Y180F) and TPMT*8 (R215H) were
0.13 and 1.00, respectively, indicating the substitutions to be structurally
tolerable. Positions 180 and 215 of the human protein sequence are
used as reference to describe the homologous positions of the compared
species.

SAM Does Not Add Significantly
to TPMT Thermodynamic Stability
The cofactor, SAM, has recently
been demonstrated to contribute
to the cellular stability of TPMT, protecting the protein from degradation,
which was shown to increase in methionine-deficient cells (methionine
is a precursor of SAM).25 We have studied
the contributions of SAM and found that the cofactor makes only minor
contributions to the thermodynamic stability of the TPMT secondary
structure in vitro, as determined by thermal denaturation monitored
by CD spectroscopy. It is worth noting that although the Tm values of the protein with ANS are higher than those
with SAM (Table 1);
this could be a reflection of the different binding affinities of
the two ligands. The Kd of ANS is 10-fold
higher than that of SAM, and the Tm values
obtained with the respective ligand differ correspondingly, possibly
due to coupling of binding and unfolding equilibria during thermal
denaturation. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulation has shown
that the cofactor contributes to the ordering of αE (residues
134–141) secondary structure, despite the presence of an otherwise
disruptive proline residue (P139) in this helix.37 In the apoprotein, helix αE was found to be disordered,
causing the solvent accessible surface area of the SAM-binding site
to increase. This interesting characteristic could be a mechanism
to provide increased accessibility to facilitate binding of the cofactor
after dissociation of SAH to promote the next catalytic cycle. It
could also offer an explanation as to why the observed half-life of
TPMT decreases in cofactor-deficient cells. If SAM is not available,
the secondary structure is not stabilized, causing the apoprotein
to expose otherwise buried residues to the solvent. It has been demonstrated
that in the absence of the cofactor, the exposure of reactive cysteine
thiols increases over time, indicating gradual unfolding of the protein
structure.38 By contrast, with SAM present,
no significant increase in thiol group exposure was observed. It is
possible that the ordering of helix αE and the decreased exposure
of buried thiols in the presence of SAM induce only minor changes
in the secondary structure of TPMT that are not reflected in the observed
CD signal. The absence of an observable increase in Tm could also be due to the ligand interacting with the
unfolded state of the protein, which would affect the thermodynamics
of the binding equilibrium and, ultimately, the resulting melting
temperature.39 Similar to our observations,
the thermal unfolding of the human histamine N-methyltransferase
(which is structurally very closely related to TPMT) in the presence
of SAM did not result in an increase in Tm compared with the apoprotein.40 Although
there are more examples of SAM–MTs whose Tm values are not increased by SAM41 or SAH,42 the thermal stability of methyltransferases
(MTs) seems to be differently affected by binding of these ligands
because there are also reports of significantly increased Tm values when SAM is added.43,44 Despite the considerable conservation of the structure45,46 and SAM-binding sequence motifs47 within
the SAM-dependent MT (SAM–MT) family, there does not seem to
be an apparent consensus in cofactor/coproduct binding properties
among these proteins. Although our experiments have not established
an increased thermal stability, it is possible that the effects observed
by Milek et al.25 are not caused by increased
thermodynamic stabilization of TPMT in the presence of the cofactor
but are instead because of the exposure of the otherwise buried regions
of the protein in the absence of SAM, as demonstrated by others.37,38 Exposure of buried regions could cause the apoprotein to appear
misfolded, resulting in increased degradation of TPMT in cofactor-deficient
cells, shortening the half-life of the protein in vivo.

Probing Stability
and Characteristics of the TPMT Tertiary Structure
In this
study and in our previous work, we have seen that far-UV
CD spectroscopy is useful in detecting variants that are destabilized
relative to wild-type TPMT7,8 because this method
allows for rapid screening of the secondary structure stability and
folding pattern of the protein and its variants. However, while this
is a useful technique, it is limited to studies of the secondary structure.
Because (to our knowledge) no rapid and reliable method of probing
the tertiary structure of TPMT is available to date, we have developed
a method in which the fluorescent dye ANS is used as a tool to probe
the TPMT tertiary structure and active site integrity. Our studies
show that ANS binds extensively to the native state of TPMT, and fluorescence
and ITC experiments yielded a dissociation constant, Kd, of 0.2 μM ANS with a 1:1 binding ratio. Fluorescence
spectra and thermal unfolding experiments show binding exclusively
to the folded state of TPMT, and docking simulations indicate that
ANS binds to the active site of the protein, colocalized with the
adenine moiety of SAM. The strong binding of ANS to native TPMT and
the conformity of the obtained results demonstrate the robustness
of this probe and the advantages of this method in studying the biophysical
characteristics of this particular protein and its variants. This
method in combination with CD spectroscopy is particularly powerful
because the results obtained provide comprehensive insight into the
properties of the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein,
and the characteristics of ANS binding are especially interesting
in further studies of TPMT and its variants. For example, the increase
in stability upon binding of ANS could allow crystallization of the
full-length protein as well as reasonably stable variants, which would
be tremendously beneficial to future studies of this protein. Also,
the extent of ANS binding (compared to wild type) could be used to
screen for functionally defective variants that do not exhibit the
proper active site tertiary structure. Similarly, ANS binding could
be used to rapidly gauge the condition of a TPMT sample prior to binding
studies to approximate the number of active protein molecules. Because
TPMT (particularly when purified) is not very stable over time48 and the number of intact active sites could
vary between purified batches, this is a potentially very important
area of application that could improve the accuracy and reliability
of inhibition studies, which could ultimately benefit clinical treatment
with thiopurine substances. On a similar note, this method holds great
potential as a tool for drug interaction studies using fluorescent
displacement techniques. Last, our docking simulations indicated interactions
between ANS and Ile91, which is part of a conserved SAM–MT
sequence motif.47 Because ANS and the cofactor
SAM share analogous chemical structures, it is possible that ANS could
bind similarly to other SAM–MTs as well, considering the high
degree of structural similarity within this protein family45,46 and the occurrence of conserved sequence motifs involved in cofactor
binding. If so, the method described herein would be beneficial not
only to future studies of TPMT and its variants but also to structurally
related proteins as well.

Experimental Procedures
Enzyme
Activity Measurements
TPMT enzyme activity measurements
were performed by measuring the rate of formation of 6-methyl-mercaptopurine
from 6-MP using 14C-labeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl group donor according to the previously
published protocol.7

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification
TPMT variants
(residues 1–245) were constructed using the
QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). The variants were cloned into pET28-LIC vectors,
transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Agilent
Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and incubated in the Luria-Bertani
(LB) medium overnight at 37 °C. The overnight cultures were diluted
1:200 in the LB medium and incubated until OD600 reached
≈1.0. The cells were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-thiogalactoside
at 21 °C overnight and harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C
and 3000g for 45 min. The cells were resuspended
in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol,
and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME). Lysis of the cells
was done by sonication, followed by centrifugation at 10 000g at 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was applied to
preequilibrated Ni-NTA Superflow agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Resin with bound protein was washed with binding buffer and wash buffer
[20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol,
and 2 mM β-ME]. Elution of the bound His-tagged TPMT was done
with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol,
and 2 mM β-ME. The eluted protein was immediately dialyzed against
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol,
and 2 mM β-ME. The His-tag was cleaved off by incubation of
the protein solution with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen, Merck Darmstadt,
Germany) for 6 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The protease
was removed from the solution by addition of streptavidin agarose
(Novagen, Merck Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated for 1 h with gentle
agitation. Streptavidin agarose beads with bound protease were then
removed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 1000g.
The uncleaved TPMT protein in the supernatant was separated from the
cleaved protein by capture on Ni-NTA Superflow agarose. Cleaved TPMT
flow-through was subsequently applied to a Superdex 75, S200 column
(GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and thereafter dialyzed to 20 mM
potassium phosphate (pH 7.3), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP,
and stored at −80 °C.

Circular Dichroism Measurements
Far-UV native CD spectra
were collected at 200–260 nm at 21 °C, averaged over three
scans with increments of 1 nm on a Chirascan spectrometer (Applied
Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom). Far-UV thermal unfolding
was monitored at 222 nm with the temperature increasing from 18 to
80 °C in 2° increments, with 10 scans sampled during 60
s per increment. A TPMT sample of 3 μM in 20 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.3), 75 mM NaCl, 2% glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP in a 4 mm path
length cuvette was used for measurements. The measurements in the
presence of ligand were performed under two different conditions:
in the presence of 30 μM cofactor SAM or 60 μM ANS. Determination
of Tm values and estimated errors were
obtained from three independent measurements using the software CDpal.49

Fluorescence Measurements with Extrinsic
Fluorescent Probe ANS
Fluorescence measurements were recorded
on a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer
(HORIBA Jobin Yvon S.A.S., Longjumeau, France) with 3 μM protein
solution and 60 μM ANS in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.3),
75 mM NaCl, 2% glycerol, and 0.5 mM TCEP in a 4 mm path length cuvette,
scanned between 18 and 80 °C in 2° increments. ANS was excited
at 360 nm and its emission was monitored at 400–600 nm. Thermal
unfolding was plotted as the relative change in maximum fluorescence
intensity at 475 nm as a function of increased temperature. Determination
of Tm values and estimated errors were
obtained from three independent measurements using the software CDpal.49

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Measurements
All experiments
were performed on a Malvern MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern Instruments
Ltd, England) instrument. All experiments were performed at 25 °C
with a reference power of 7 μcal s–1. A protein
concentration of approximately 50 μM was used. Ligand concentrations
were 250 μM for ANS and 250 μM for SAM dissolved in dialysis
buffer. A total of 13 injections were made. All data were analyzed
using manufacturers software. At least three separate runs of injection
were made for each variant-ligand pair.

Theoretical Structure Analysis
SIFT (sorting intolerant
from tolerant) program analysis50 was performed
to predict structural effects based upon sequence homology and physical
properties of amino acids. Mammalian sequences (16) were aligned.
Probability scores of less than 0.05 suggest a deleterious amino acid
substitution. Docking of the fluorescent ligand ANS to TPMT was performed
using AutoDock Vina51 with human TPMT (PBD
ID: 2BZG) as
the template and a search space of 20 × 20 × 20 Å.
