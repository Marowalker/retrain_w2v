Thermodynamics
and kinetics of pretilachlor adsorption on organobentonites
modified with hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride were investigated
to reveal the structural effects of organobentonites on the interaction
with pretilachlor and the diffusion of the herbicide and were related
to the controlled release from organobentonites. The adsorption of
pretilachlor was entropically driven by hydrophobic interaction. The
entropy change dropped with increasing surfactant loading from 0.4
to 1.50 times the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the bentonite
used, corresponding to a decrease in the degree of freedom of pretilachlor
molecules due to the enhanced order of surfactant in the interlayer.
The kinetics of pretilachlor adsorption was well fitted to the pseudo-second-order
model and related to the structural features of organobentonites.
The enhanced packing density of the surfactant in the interlayer generally
resulted in a reduction of the rate constant of the pretilachlor adsorption
onto organobentonites. However, the stepwise increase in the basal
spacing due to the surfactant arrangement transition, from lateral-monolayer
to lateral-bilayer at a loading level of more than 0.8 × CEC,
benefited the diffusion of pretilachlor and diminished the influence
of the increase in surfactant packing density. The release of pretilachlor
from organobentonites was predominated by Fickian diffusion, which
could be understood from the adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics.
The time taken for the release of 50% of active ingredient was 16–23
times that for the control formulation and exhibited a linear increase
with the relative value of the equilibrium constant to the rate constant
of pretilachlor adsorption.

1 Introduction
Herbicides
are the most commonly used agrochemicals for impeding
the growth of weeds and improving the yield of crops. However, only
part of herbicides reaches their target, whereas the rest remains
attached to the soil colloids or undergoes degradation and transfer
process such as migration to surface and groundwater, which has been
reported to be one of the main sources of water pollution.1−3 In the past decades, many efforts have been made to minimize the
use and impact of herbicides on the environment by developing controlled
release formulations (CRFs).4−6

The success of CRFs in agriculture
practice is critically dependent
on the development of the matrix of high loading efficacy and controllable
release properties.6 Clay minerals have
been considered as good candidates for CRF because of their potential
adsorbent properties in addition to their abundance and low cost.
Bentonite is a natural material containing montmorillonite as a major
constituent and has been considered as a potential platform for CRF
of insecticides and herbicides due to the high specific surface area.
Moreover, the surface properties and nanostructure in the interlayer
of bentonite was readily regulated by organic modifications, which
improved the adsorption capability toward several herbicides and reduce
leaching in soil.7−12

The knowledge of the structural effects of the matrix on the
release
behavior of pesticides would be helpful in developing new formulations
to fulfill the actual requirement of environmental control. The release
of pesticides from the CRFs was usually understood from the adsorption
capability and the permeability of the matrix. A higher adsorption
capability and a lower permeability usually resulted in a slower release.13,14 In the past decades, much attention has been paid to the development
of organobentonites with high adsorption capacity and feasibility
to regulate the adsorption capacity of organobentonites.15−17 However, little is known about the effects of structural features,
such as molecular structure, loading level, and orientation of modifying
agents in the interlayer space, on the permeability of organobentonites.
The release behavior from organobentonites was qualitatively interpreted
from the adsorption capacity of the matrix.18,19

In a previous work, organobentonites modified with dodecyltrimethyl
ammonium chloride (DTMA) and hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride
(HTMA) were used as carriers of pretilachlor [2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(2-propoxyethyl) acetamide],
a selective pre-emergent herbicide widely applied to control annual
grasses and broadleaf weeds in rice field, to obtain controlled release
granules. The results indicated that the time taken for 50% of active
ingredients to be released from organobentonites with surfactant loading
level from 0.6 to 1.2 times the cation exchange capacity (CEC) increased
with increasing adsorption coefficient by the Freundlich equation
and is seemed to be related to the interlayer spacing and packing
density of the surfactant in the interlayer. Unfortunately, the mechanism
of structural effects of organobentonites on pretilachlor release
remained unclear due to the lack of the physical significance of adsorption
coefficient by the Freundlich equation and a suitable method to evaluate
the permeability of the matrix.20

To get a further insight into the release properties of organobentonites,
equilibrium adsorption of pretilachlor onto organobentonites with HTMA loading level
from 0.4 to 1.5 × CEC was investigated. The adsorption thermodynamic
parameters were used to reveal the interaction between the matrix
and the herbicide. Kinetics of pretilachlor adsorption was also studied
to illustrate the structural effects of organobentonites on the diffusion
of pretilachlor molecules in the interlayer gallery. The release behavior
of pretilachlor from organobentonites was understood from the thermodynamics
and kinetics of pretilachlor adsorption. The results were helpful
to evaluate the release properties of organobentonites and explore
the organobentonite-based CRFs.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization
of Organobentonites
Organobentonites modified with HTMA at
a feeding level in the range
from 0.4 to 1.5 × CEC were prepared. The proportion of HTMA adsorbed
on the bentonite used was found to drop dramatically when the feeding
level was more than 1.5 × CEC.21 While
those with a surfactant loading level less than 0.4 × CEC were
subjected to suspension and blocked the filter membrane in the stirred-flow
reactor system used in the adsorption kinetics and release of pretilachlor.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) is a useful method to characterize
the arrangement model of the intercalated surfactants of organoclay,
based on the basal spacing and the dimensions of the surfactant molecule.
XRD patterns for the natural bentonite and organobentonites are presented
in Figure 1, and the
basal spacing d001 is listed in Table 1. The bentonite used
was a typical Ca2+-bentonite, of which the d001-value was 1.48 nm.22 A
small quantity of HTMA of less than 0.8 × CEC slightly decreased
the basal spacing of the bentonite. The interlayer separation, ca.
0.46 nm, agreed with the size of the head group of the quaternary
ammonium, indicating that HTMA+ had intercalated into the
interlayer of bentonite and replaced the exchangeable Ca2+ ion and water molecules adsorbed.23 A
stepwise increase in the basal spacing to about 1.8 nm for organobentonites
with higher surfactant loading indicated that the intercalated HTMA+ underwent a transition from a lateral-monolayer (d001 = 1.45–1.47 nm) to a lateral-bilayer
orientation (d001 = 1.75–1.85 nm)
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).23−26

Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been widely
used to probe the conformation of the adsorbed surfactant on clay
minerals. The frequency of the CH2 absorption is sensitive
to the ordering and packing density of the surfactants, the environment,
and interactions between alkyl chains. The FTIR spectra of organobentonites
are presented in Figure 2. The CH2 asymmetric stretching (νas(CH2)) and symmetric stretching vibrations (νs(CH2)) of the adsorbed surfactant were found to be around
2927 and 2854 cm–1 and slightly shifted to 2921
and 2850 cm–1 due to the increasing surfactant loading
level up to 1.5 × CEC, close to those of pure HTMA (around 2919
and 2848 cm–1, respectively), indicating that the
adsorbed surfactant developed from a less ordered conformation of
low packing density to an ordered one of high packing density.25−28 An increase in hydrophobicity of organobentonite was also observed,
as indicated by the decrease in the relative absorption of the adsorbed
hygroscopic water around 3450 cm–1 to the structural
−OH of organobentonites at 3630 cm–1.10

2.2 Adsorption Isotherms
The isotherms
of pretilachlor adsorption are shown in Figure 3. The linear increase of pretilachlor adsorption
on organobentonites with the equilibrium concentration in the solution
indicated that the adsorption was predominated by the partition of
pretilachlor between the aqueous phase and the organic phase created
by long hydrocarbon chain surfactant in the interlayer.29,30 The apparent adsorption equilibrium constant (Ka) was thus derived from the slope of isotherms and found
to increase from 0.68 × 103 mL·g–1 for BH0.4 to 3.30 × 103 mL·g–1 for BH1.5, much more than that for bentonite
(Table 1).

Figure 3 Isotherms for
pretilachlor adsorption on HTMA-bent.

The adsorption capability was usually related to the organic carbon
content of the clay. To evaluate the impact of organic carbon content
on the adsorption capability of organobentonites toward pretilachlor,
the organic carbon contents of organobentonites (foc) were determined by elemental analysis (Table 1). The adsorption equilibrium
constants of pretilachlor normalized to the carbon content of the
organoclay (Koc) were derived by the following
equation 1  Koc values
of
HTMA-bent first increased and then slightly decreased with increasing
surfactant loading level, reaching a maximum of around 0.8 ×
CEC (Table 1 and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Similar
results were obtained for the adsorption of other organic compounds
on organobentonites modified with quaternary ammonium surfactants.
It has been suggested that the increase of the surfactant benefits
the formation of the organic phase in the interlayer gallery. However,
quaternary ammonium surfactant in molecule form appeared in the interlayer
via a hydrophobic interaction when the loading exceeded 0.8 ×
CEC. In the confined clay interlayer, the available space to accommodate
the organic solutes reduced when the surfactant loading increased
to a higher level. Moreover, the ammonium heads and the counterions
of the surfactant interfered with the hydrophobic interaction between
the surfactant molecules, resulting in a reduction of the adsorption
capability of organobentonite toward hydrocarbon organic compounds.30−32

2.3 Adsorption Thermodynamics
To gain
further insight into the structural effects of organobentonites on
pretilachlor adsorption, equilibrium adsorption was conducted for
different temperatures at 293, 303, and 313 K. The equilibrium constant
(Ka) was obtained from the equilibrium
concentration of pretilachlor in the solutions (ce) and the adsorbed amount onto organobentonites (qe). The thermodynamic parameters of pretilachlor
adsorption were determined from Van’t Hoff equation by plotting
ln Ka vs 1/T (Figure 4) 2   3   4  where T and R are the thermodynamic temperature and gas constant, respectively;
ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy,
respectively. The results are listed in Table 2.

The
negative value of ΔG at all temperatures
indicated that pretilachlor adsorption on HTMA-bent was spontaneous
and that the solute was favored to stay in the stationary phase rather
than in the mobile phase. Generally, the physisorption was characterized
by a standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°)
of the absolute magnitude between 0 and −20 kJ·mol–1, while for chemisorption ΔG° is in the range from −80 to −400 kJ·mol–1.33 In the temperature
range studied, ΔG for pretilachlor adsorption
on HTMA-bent was found to be between −15.8 and −21.9
kJ·mol–1, indicating that the adsorption was
physical in nature. The noncovalent binding usually originated from
hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond,
or van der Waals interaction, which was reflected by the thermodynamic
parameters. Hydrophobic interactions between two apolar molecules
have been known as entropy-driven processes with a favorable entropy
and unfavorable enthalpy (ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, ΔH < TΔS), opposite to the enthalpy-driven hydrogen
bond and van der Waals interaction (ΔH <
0, ΔS < 0, |ΔH| >
|TΔS|). The interaction dominated
by electrostatic attraction is characterized by a positive entropy
and a minor unfavorable enthalpy (ΔH ∼
0 or ΔH > 0, ΔS >
0).34 The positive values of enthalpy and
entropy
change indicated that pretilachlor adsorption was driven by entropy
through hydrophobic interaction. Despite the decrease in entropy change,
the reduction of the unfavorable enthalpy change led to an enhancement
of the adsorption capability of HTMA-bent with increasing surfactant
loading, as indicated by an increase in |ΔG| (Table 2).

The adsorption of pretilachlor on organobentonites via partition
can be considered as a transfer from the aqueous phase to the organic
phase in the interlayer gallery. The decrease in the degree of freedom
of the adsorbed species was usually accompanied by a negative entropy
change.35 However, the strong hydrophobicity
of pretilachlor (octanol–water partition coefficient log Kow = 4.08)36 made
it a structure maker to induce an enhancement in the hydrogen-bonding
network in the hydration cosphere, as compared to the bulk.37−39 The transfer of pretilachlor to the organic phase in the interlayer
gallery of organobentonite would release the solvating water molecules
to the bulk, bringing about an increase in the entropy of the whole
system, which can be attributed to the positive entropy change for
pretilachlor adsorption (Table 2). Since the intercalation of quaternary ammonium surfactants
was dominated by ion exchange at the loading level less than 1.0 ×
CEC,30 an increase in surfactant loading
usually resulted in an enhanced hydrophobicity of organobentonite,
as illustrated by the decreased relative IR absorption intensity of
the adsorbed water to that of the structural −OH of organobentonites
(Figure 2). However,
the value of ΔS dropped dramatically with increasing
surfactant loading up to 0.8 × CEC (Table 2), indicating that the hydrophobicity of
organobentonite had little influence on the dehydration of pretilachlor
molecules. The reduction of entropy change may be related to the decrease
in the degree of freedom of pretilachlor molecules due to the enhancement
in structure order and packing density of surfactant in the interlayer
gallery. Following the suggestion by Xu et al.,30 quaternary ammonium surfactant in molecular form intercalated
in the clay via hydrophobic interaction when the loading exceeded
0.8 × CEC. The ammonium heads and the counterions would interfere
with the hydrophobic interaction of the surfactant and destroyed the
close packing in clay galleries. As a result, the entropy decrease
due to the solidification of pretilachlor in the organic phase of
HTMA-bent became less evident and quickly leveled off when the surfactant
loading level was more than 0.8 × CEC (Table 2 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

2.4 Adsorption
Kinetics
Adsorption kinetics
of pretilachlor on HTMA-bent is presented in Figure 5. The profiles were fitted to two commonly
used kinetics models, pseudo-first-order (eq 5) and pseudo-second-order (eq 6)40 5   6  where qt (mg·g–1) is the amount of pretilachlor
adsorbed at time t (min); q1 (mg·g–1) and q2 (mg·g–1) are the maximum adsorption
capacities for the pseudo-first-order adsorption and pseudo-second-order
adsorption, respectively; and k1 (min–1) and k2 (g·mg–1·min–1) are rate constants
for the pseudo-first-order adsorption and pseudo-second-order adsorption,
respectively. The values of the maximum adsorption capacity and rate
constant were obtained by a nonlinear fit using the least-squares
method and are summarized in Table 3. Based on the R2 values,
both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models could be well
used to describe the kinetics of pretilachlor adsorption onto organobentonites.
The maximum adsorption capacity obtained by both models increased,
while the rate constant decreased and leveled off with increasing
surfactant loading. However, a further comparison showed that the
latter generally provided better results than the former. The adsorption
capacity q2 agreed well with those from
adsorption isotherms (Table S1 in the Supporting
Information). Thus, the structural effects of organobentonites on
the kinetics of adsorption and the release of pretilachlor were discussed
based on the results from the pseudo-second-order model in the following
text.

Several
rate-limiting steps and mechanisms were involved in the
kinetics of adsorption onto organobentonites, including (1) diffusion
of adsorptive from the bulk solution to the surface of clay particles,
(2) migration into the interlayer gallery, and (3) binding to the
active side.41,42 It was apparent that an increase
of basal spacing would result in an increase of interface between
the bulk solution and the organic phase created by the surfactant
and thus benefit the diffusion of the active ingredient into the interlayer
gallery of organobentonite. However, the increase in surfactant packing
density would slow down the migration of adsorptive. As illustrated
by XRD, the intercalated HTMA adopted a lateral-monolayer arrangement
mode at a loading level less than 0.8 × CEC and the increase
in surfactant loading had little influence on the basal spacing of
HTMA-bent (Table 1).
Thus, the enhanced packing density of the surfactant retarded the
migration of pretilachlor molecules in the interlayer, resulting in
a dramatic drop of the rate constant of adsorption (Table 3). A similar trend was also
observed for the adsorption onto organobentonites with surfactant
loading more than 0.8 × CEC. However, the decrease in the rate
constant was much less evident than that for organobentonites with
a lower surfactant loading (Table 3 and Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information), as the stepwise increase in the basal spacing (Table 1) benefited the diffusion
of pretilachlor into the interlayer gallery and diminished the influence
of surfactant loading on the increase in surfactant packing density.
The results were quite consistent with the entropy change of pretilachlor
adsorption (Table 2 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

2.5 Release Studies
The release of pretilachlor
from organobentonites was investigated in the stirred-flow reactor
system, which was also used in adsorption kinetics. The technical
pretilachlor was mixed with fine sands and used as control formulation,
and the dissolution profile was obtained under the same conditions.
The cumulative release of pretilachlor from organobentonites and the
control formulation are summarized in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Cumulative release of pretilachlor from HTMA-bent
in water. Inset:
dissolution profile of pretilachlor in water.

The release profiles were fitted to the Rigter–Peppas equation43,44 7  where Mt/M0 is the cumulative release of
the active ingredient at time t, k is a characteristic constant of the system, and n is the diffusional exponent to describe the kinetics and the release
mechanism. The release from slab, cylinder, and sphere systems via
the Fickian diffusion mechanism was characterized by n values of 0.5, 0.45, and 0.43, respectively. For the release via
“case II transport” mechanism, a non-Fickian release,
the values of n were 1.0, 0.89, and 0.85, respectively.43,44 The values of k and n were obtained
by a nonlinear fit, from which the time taken for the release of 50%
of the active ingredient, T50, was calculated
(Table 4). The T50 value for the control formulation was estimated
by an interpolation method, as the Rigter–Peppas equation did
not fit well to the fast dissolution of pretilachlor in water and
in the stirred flowing condition. The release of the herbicide was
greatly retarded by the organobentonites, of which the T50 value was 16–23 times that of the control formulation
and increased linearly with increasing surfactant loading level (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

The
release of pesticides from CRF was usually understood from
the adsorption capability and the permeability of the matrix. A higher
adsorption capability would result in a slower release, a consequence
of the lower equilibrium concentration in the medium.13,14 The T50 values for the pretilachlor
release from organobentonites totally increased with increasing adsorption
equilibrium constant Ka (Tables 1 and 4). However, the upward curvature of the T50 vs Ka plot suggested a possible alteration
of matrix permeability induced by the structural change in the interlayer
(Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).

The value of diffusional exponent n from 0.50
to 0.59 (Table 4) indicated
that the pretilachlor release from organobentonites was predominated
by a Fickian diffusion mechanism.43,44 In an aqueous
environment, the active ingredient migrated in the interlayer space
and diffused into the release medium due to the concentration gradient
and was sustained by the lamellar of bentonite and surfactant molecules
intercalated. Thermodynamic studies have indicated that the adsorption
of pretilachlor on HTMA-bent is physical and thus a reversible process
of the release. The rate constant of adsorption ka and that of desorption kd could be related to the equilibrium constant Ka 8  Therefore, a decrease in the rate constant
or an increase in the equilibrium constant of adsorption would result
in a slower desorption or release of pretilachlor, which was confirmed
by the linear increase of the T50 value
for pretilachlor release with the relative value of the equilibrium
constant Ka to the rate constant k2 for pretilachlor adsorption on HTMA-bent (Figure 7). The results from
this work indicated that the structure of organobentonites had a similar
influence on the kinetics of release and adsorption of pretilachlor
and that the adsorption rate constant could be used to describe the
permeability of organobentonites. A combinational study of thermodynamics
and kinetics of adsorption would be helpful to evaluate the release
properties of organobentonites and explore the organobentonite-based
CRFs.

3 Conclusions
Organobentonites
modified with HTMA were excellent adsorbents for
pretilachlor and potential platforms for CRF. The adsorption of pretilachlor
on HTMA-bent was dominated by the hydrophobic interaction accompanying
a positive enthalpy and entropy change. With increase in the loading
level of HTMA from 0.4 to 1.5 × CEC, the intercalated surfactant
developed from a less ordered conformation of low packing density
to an ordered one of high packing density, leading to a decrease in
the degree of freedom of the adsorbed pretilachlor molecules and thus
a decrease in the entropy change. However, an enhancement of the adsorption
capability of organobentonite toward pretilachlor was achieved due
to the reduction of the unfavorable enthalpy change.

The kinetics
of pretilachlor adsorption was related to the basal
spacing of organobentonites and the surfactant packing density in
the interlayer gallery. The intercalated HTMA adopted a lateral-monolayer
arrangement at the loading level less than 0.8 × CEC. The increase
in surfactant loading had little influence on the basal spacing of
HTMA-bent. However, the enhanced packing density of the surfactant
weakened the diffusion of pretilachlor molecules in the interlayer,
resulting in a dramatic drop in the adsorption rate constant. The
surfactant arrangement underwent a transition from lateral-monolayer
to lateral-bilayer at the loading level of more than 0.8 × CEC.
A decrease in the rate constant of pretilachlor adsorption on organobentonite
was also observed, although much less evident than that for organobentonites
with lower surfactant loading, as the stepwise increase in the basal
spacing benefited the diffusion of pretilachlor into the interlayer
gallery of organobentonite and reduced the influence on the increase
in surfactant packing density.

The release of pretilachlor was
greatly retarded by incorporating
it into HTMA-bent. The release was dominated by Fickian diffusion,
which could be understood from the thermodynamics and kinetics of
pretilachlor adsorption on the matrix. The time taken for the release
of 50% of active ingredient from organobentonites was 16–23
times that for the control formulation and increased linearly with
the relative value of the equilibrium constant to the rate constant
of pretilachlor adsorption.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Bentonite was obtained
from Guangxi Ningming Minerals Co. (China). The cation exchange capacity
(CEC) of the bentonite was about 0.82 mmol·g–1. Analytical grade hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (HTMA) and
methanol were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China).
Technical grade pretilachlor (95%) was kindly supplied by Guangxi
Tianyuan Biochemical Co. (China).

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Preparation of Organobentonites
Organobentonites were
prepared following the process described in
previous work.21 Briefly, a stock solution
containing HTMA of the amount equivalent to 0.4–1.5 ×
CEC of the clay was added to the dispersion containing ca. 2% bentonite
under agitation and kept at 60 °C for 24 h. The resulting organobentonites
were then separated by vacuum filtration, dried to constant weight
at 60 °C, ground in an agate mortar and sifted through a 150
μm mesh sieve. The organobentonite is denoted as HTMA-bent and
labeled as BHx, where x is the quantity of HTMA used and presented as the fractions of the
clay’s CEC. The carbon content of organobentonites was determined
on a PerkinElmer PE2400II elemental analyzer.

4.2.2 XRD
XRD patterns of organobentonites
were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-2500V diffractometer. The Ni-filtered
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) was used as the X-ray
source. All scans were performed in the range of 2θ = 3–10°
at a speed of 4°·min–1, with a step size
of 0.02°. The basal spacing of organobentonites was calculated
from the 2θ values of the (001) plane, using the Bragg equation.

4.2.3 FTIR
FTIR spectra were collected
from 400 to 4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1 on a Shimadzu FTIR-8400S FTIR spectrometer in the
transmission mode. Organobentonites were ground with KBr in the weight
ratio of about 2:100 and compressed into pellets before the performance.

4.2.4 HPLC
The concentration of pretilachlor
in the solutions was determined by a Shimadzu SPD-10A high-performance
liquid chromatograph equipped with a UV–vis detector set at
225 nm and an ODS column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile
phase was a methanol–water mixture (volume ratio of 90:10)
at a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min–1. Solutions containing
pretilachlor were passed through nylon filters of 0.22 μm pore
diameter before the performance.

4.2.5 Adsorption
Isotherms
Fifty milligrams
of organobentonite was mixed with 50 mL of the aqueous solution of
pretilachlor of concentration ranging from 5 to 40 μg·mL–1. The dispersions were kept on a multichannel magnetic
stirrer equipped with a water bath thermostated to 25 °C for
4 h to reach an equilibrium. The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC
and the adsorbed amount of pretilachlor was calculated from the difference
between initial and final concentrations. The performance was carried
out duplicate, and the average results were used to obtain the adsorption
isotherms of pretilachlor on organobentonites.

4.2.6 Adsorption Thermodynamics
Similar
to the performance of adsorption isotherms, 50 mL of a solution containing
pretilachlor in ca. 40 μg·mL–1 concentration
was mixed with 50 mg of organobentonite under agitation and kept for
4 h to reach an equilibrium. The equilibrium concentration of pretilachlor
in the solution was determined by HPLC, and the adsorption equilibrium
constant was evaluated. The performance was carried out at 20, 30,
and 40 °C and for least 5 times under the same conditions. The
average results were used to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters
of pretilachlor adsorption onto organobentonites.

4.2.7 Adsorption Kinetics
Adsorption
kinetics of pretilachlor was carried out on a stirred-flow reactor
system made in our laboratory (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The ca. 1.0 cm3 propylene
stirred-flow reactor had a side inlet at the bottom and was connected
to an LC-10AD pump (Shimadzu, Japan) by 0.5 mm i.d. poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
tube. The outlet in the lid was covered with a nylon filter membrane
of pore size 0.45 μm to retain the samples in the reactor. The
reactor carrying 25 mg of organobentonite and a magnetic stirring
bar was immersed in a water bather thermostated to 25 °C. The
stock solution containing pretilachlor in the concentration of ca.
40 μg·mL–1 was circulated at a flow rate
of 1 mL·min–1. The output solution fractions
were collected in predefined time duration, and the mass was determined
on a Mettler AE200 analytical balance. The herbicide was analyzed
by HPLC, and the adsorbed amounts were obtained from the concentration
difference between the input and the output solutions.

4.2.8 Preparation of Pretilachlor-Loaded Organobentonites
A stock solution of 1 g of pretilachlor (a.i.) dissolved in 5 mL
of methanol was dropped into aqueous dispersions containing 5 g of
organobentonites under rigorous agitation. The dispersions were kept
at room temperature for 12 h and separated by vacuum filtration. The
resulting pretilachlor-loaded organobentonites were dried to a constant
weight at 60 °C, ground in an agate mortar, and sifted through
a 150 μm mesh sieve. Fifty milligrams of pretilachlor-loaded
organobentonites were extracted by 50 mL of methanol 2 times. The
extract was separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed
by HPLC to evaluate the amount of pretilachlor loaded. Organobentonites
incorporating pretilachlor were labeled as BHxP.

4.2.9 Pretilachlor Release
in Water
The
release of pretilachlor from organobentonites in water was conducted
in the stirred-flow reactor system using a method similar to that
used for adsorption kinetics. Twenty-five milligrams of pretilachlor-loaded
organobentonite was placed in the reaction chamber kept at 25 °C
and water was circulated at a flow rate of 1 mL·min–1. The output solution fractions were collected in predefined time
duration. The herbicide was analyzed by HPLC and the amount released
was calculated to obtain a cumulative release profile.
