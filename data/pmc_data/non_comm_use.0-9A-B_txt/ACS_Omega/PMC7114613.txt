Colorimetric
detection of glucose using enzyme-mimic nanoparticles
(NPs) has been drawing great attention. However, many NPs lack good
stability in solution, which results in reduced color change of substrates
in colorimetric detection. Liner soluble macromolecules with high
cationic density may be suitable candidates for the stabilization
of NPs. Herein, we prepared polyethyleneimine-stabilized platinum
NPs (Ptn-PEI NPs) for colorimetric detection
of glucose. The platinum NPs (Pt NPs) used in this system had small
size (from 3.21 to 3.70 nm) and narrow size distribution. Pt50-PEI NPs had high stability within one week with a hydrodynamic size
of ∼25 nm and slightly positive zeta potential. Pt50-PEI NPs-catalyzed oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) in the presence of H2O2, generating blue
oxidized TMB (oxTMB), which indicated the peroxidase-like property
of Pt50-PEI NPs. The optimal condition for this reaction
was pH = 4.0 at 30 °C. More importantly, Pt50-PEI
NPs were successfully used to detect glucose concentration by a colorimetric
method with high selectivity. The established method had a linear
concentration range from 10 to 5000 μM with a detection limit
of 4.2 μM. For example, the concentration of glucose in saliva
was tested to be 0.15 mM using our method. The high stability of Pt50-PEI NPs enhanced the high accessibility of the active center
of Pt NPs for substrates and consequent excellent catalytic property.
This established method has great potential to be used in various
applications for glucose detection in the future.

1 Introduction
Natural
enzymes have high catalytic efficiency and excellent specificity.1 These properties lead to their wide application
in detection,2 drug delivery,3 and the degradation of organic pollutants.4 As for the detection, natural horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) has been used in the catalytic oxidation of colorless 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) into blue oxidized TMB (oxTMB) in the bio-related detection,
and oxTMB has a high molar absorption coefficient.5 However, natural enzymes are relatively expensive and easy
to be inactivated by the surrounding environment. It is important
to seek mimic enzymes to overcome the shortage and maintain the merit
of natural enzymes. Gao and co-workers first reported that magnetic
Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) possessed peroxidase-like
activity.6 Besides, many other nanomaterials
have been demonstrated to exhibit good peroxidase-like properties,
such as Co3O4,7 Co4N nanowires,8 Prussian blue,9 graphene oxide,10 and
noble metal nanoparticle.11 These nanomaterials
have more flexible structures and higher chemical stability compared
with HRP. They are capable of catalyzing the oxidation of TMB into
blue oxTMB, which have been further used to detect glucose concentration.
For example, core–shell gold nanorods were used for the colorimetric
determination of glucose in the range of 2.5–200 μM;12 TiO2-encapsulated Au (Au@TiO2) yolk–shell had a linear range in 5–100 μM
and a detection limit of 4.0 μM.13 However, many nanomaterials lack high stability in solution, which
restrains their catalytic efficiency.

Platinum element is widely
used in chemical industries. Several
platinum NPs (Pt NPs) possess mimetic activities.14−17 The improvement of the catalytic
activity of Pt NPs still has received increasing attention.18−20 Smaller NPs often have larger specific surface areas. However, they
are likely to form aggregation in aqueous solution because of their
larger surface energy, which would restrict their catalytic efficiency.
In fact, the catalytic efficiency of Pt NPs is dependent on the number
of available active sites on the surface of NPs. Stable Pt NPs in
aqueous solution tend to have more accessible active sites. Thus,
many substances have been employed to stabilize the metal NPs, and
a substantial fraction of the surface of the metal NPs participates
in catalytic reactions.21,22 These substances include
bovine serum albumin,23 yeast extract,24 sodium polyacrylate,25 polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),26 and dendrimers.27 Platinum NPs using bovine serum albumin have
salt-resistant property.23 Small Pt nanoclusters
were prepared using yeast extract as the reductant and stabilizer.24 Sodium polyacrylate-stabilized Pt NPs had 3.25
times higher hydrogen generation activity than that of Pt NPs without
stabilization under the same conditions.25 Pt nanocubes were capped by PVP,28 and
Pt NPs were prepared using dendrimers terminated with alkyl chains
as the template.29 However, polyvinylpyrrolidone
may cause cancers, and dendrimers are too expensive to be scaled up.
In contrast, polyethyleneimine (PEI) has an affordable price and the
highest cationic density among water-soluble polymers, providing its
potential to stabilize metal NPs in large scale. In addition, the
linear PEI molecule should keep most of the catalytic center of Pt
NPs available. The higher amount of catalytic center could lead to
the higher catalytic oxidation of TMB and obvious change. Pt NPs (12.9–70.7
nm) have been successfully prepared by PEI molecules with molecular
weights from 300, 1200, and 10,000.30 However,
the sizes of aforementioned Pt NPs are relatively big, and the stability
of prepared NPs is not investigated. Thus, it is still necessary to
obtain smaller Pt NPs with high stability in solution.

In this
work, a facile method to prepare PEI (Mw 70,000)-stabilized platinum NPs (Ptn-PEI NPs) was developed. The monodispersed Ptn-PEI NPs were highly stable. Ptn-PEI NPs efficiently catalyzed TMB with H2O2 to produce blue oxTMB. More importantly, the blue color of this
system was dependent on the concentration of glucose. Thus, a colorimetric
method based on Ptn-PEI NPs to sensitively
detect glucose concentration was established for the first time. The
glucose concentration of saliva was measured, suggesting the great
potential of Ptn-PEI NPs for bio-related
detection.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of Ptn-PEI NPs
The Ptn-PEI NPs
were prepared by mixing PEI solution (pH = 4.0, 1 mg/mL) and K2PtCl4 (2 mM) aqueous solution in PE tubes, where
PEI was used as the template and NaBH4 was used as the
reducing agent. All the tubes were located in a constant temperature
metal mixer at 20 °C for 20 min. PtCl42– and nitrogen atom of the PEI formed a complex. The concentration
of PtCl42– around nitrogen atoms of the
PEI was much higher than that of bulk solution. Then, PtCl42– was very quickly reduced to zero-valent Pt atoms
by the addition of strong reducing agent NaBH4. These Pt
atoms gathered together to Pt NPs which stabilized by PEI. This reduction
process was monitored by UV–vis spectra. Figure 1a showed that the K2PtCl4 had an obvious characteristic absorption peak at 320 and 383 nm
corresponding to d–d transitions.31 Two peaks were weakened after incubation of K2PtCl4 with PEI. After the addition of NaBH4, a broad
and continuous absorption appeared. In addition, as shown in Figure 1b, when the molar
ratio of K2PtCl4 to PEI increased from 50 to
150, the absorbance of Ptn-PEI NPs gradually
increased. The Ptn-PEI NPs were well dissolved
in aqueous solution. PAMAM dendrimer-encapsulated Pt NPs also had
similar results.29 Taken together, the
results indicated the successful preparation of Ptn-PEI NPs.

Figure 1 (a) UV–vis spectra of PEI, K2PtCl4, PEI + K2PtCl4, (b) UV–vis spectra,
and photos of Ptn-PEI NPs.

As shown in Figure 2, PEI had several peaks from 2.45 to 2.74 ppm, which were
assigned
to the proton of −CH2–CH2– from the PEI skeleton. After
the stabilization of Pt NPs by PEI, the 1H NMR spectrum
of Pt50-PEI had a wider range from 2.45 to 3.28 ppm than
that of PEI. The difference should be due to the encapsulation some
proton peaks of −CH2–CH2– from the PEI skeleton by Pt
NPs.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of PEI and Pt50-PEI.

The size of metal NPs has a great impact on their catalytic
efficiency.
As shown in Figure 3, the sizes of prepared Pt NPs stabilized by PEI were examined by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The sizes of Pt NPs for Pt50-PEI, Pt100-PEI, and Pt150-PEI were
3.21 ± 0.87, 3.38 ± 0.74, and 3.7 ± 0.75 nm, respectively.
It should be noted that as the molar ratio of K2PtCl4 to PEI increased, the sizes of Pt NPs increased. Thus, Pt
NPs had very small sizes with a narrow size distribution. They also
had high dispersity without aggregation and high specific surface
areas. However, the Pt NPs without stabilization by PEI showed obvious
aggregation and big size (Figure S1). Thus,
PEI with proper molecular weight was important for the high stability
and size control of Pt NPs. One of the most common methods selected
to synthesize Pt NPs involves the use of sodium polyacrylate25 and polyvinylpyrrolidone.26 The size of Pt NPs with sodium polyacrylate was about 50
nm with certain aggregation.25 PVP is a
nonionic polymer, while PEI is a cationic polymer. Spherical Pt NPs
are prepared within the size from 16 to 23 nm using Punica garanatum peel extract.32 The Pt NPs (10–50 nm) are synthesized using Prunus
× yedoensis tree gum.33 In short,
a facile method of preparation of Ptn-PEI
was established, where PEI (70,000) was used to control the size of
Pt NPs and enhance the stability of Ptn-PEI.

Figure 3 TEM images and relevant size distribution of Pt NPs inside of (a)
Pt50-PEI, (b) Pt100-PEI, and (c) Pt150-PEI. Pt NPs stabilized by PEI had a small size from 3.21 to 3.70
nm.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) is commonly used to study
the surface element composition and valence state of metal composite
materials.34 Herein, as shown in Figure 4a, the peaks at 284.6
and 398.9 eV were assigned to C 1s and N 1s, respectively. They were
from PEI. The peak at 529.3 eV was attributed to O 1s indicating the
presence of H2O, which was because of the strong binding
water ability of PEI. Figure 4b further showed that the binding energy of the Pt 4f had
two characteristic peaks at 72.6 and 75.8 eV, which belonged to the
Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 orbits, respectively.
Pt NPs with zero valence prepared by Natarajan Prabu had 72.21 and
75.81 eV. Thus, Pt(II) has been reduced by NaBH4 to generate
Pt (0). The slight difference should be due to the different size
of Pt NPs and surface properties.35 In
short, XPS results demonstrated the successful preparation of Pt (0)
stabilized by PEI.

Figure 4 (a) XPS spectrum of Pt50-PEI NPs and (b) binding
energy
of Pt 4f. Pt NPs were successfully stabilized by PEI.

Furthermore, the hydration status and stability of Pt50-PEI NPs were measured using DLS technology. The changes
of the hydrodynamic
size of Pt50-PEI NPs under different pH from 4 to 9 were
used to evaluate their stability. As shown in Figure 5a, the hydrodynamic size of Pt50-PEI NPs was about 25 nm within one week, indicating their high stability
for a long time. In contrast, the Pt NPs without the stabilization
of PEI gradually precipitated. The hydrodynamic size of Pt50-PEI NPs included the PEI molecule, which was bigger than the size
of Pt NPs measured by using TEM. Furthermore, Figure 5b showed that the zeta potential of Pt50-PEI NPs changed from 9.4 ± 2.7 mV at pH 1 to 4.9 ±
2.6 mV at pH 10. The stability of NPs was dependent on the zeta potential
and polymer template. High zeta potential of NPs (>30 mV) means
their
good stability.36,37 In addition, the polymer template
inhibits agglomeration of NPs by steric effects.38,39 As for Pt50-PEI NPs, electrostatic repulsion and steric
hindrance between Pt50-PEI NP result in their high stability
which was beneficial to catalytic oxidation of TMB for a long time.40 In short, Pt50-PEI NPs had high stability
with a hydrodynamic size of ∼25 nm and slightly positive charge.

size and (b) zeta potential of Pt50-PEI NPs in buffer.
Pt50-PEI NPs had good stability and

2.2 Peroxidase-like Activity Assays
Many
substrates such as TMB and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) can be effectively catalyzed by HRP.
Herein, TMB was catalyzed by Pt50-PEI NPs in the presence
of H2O2 at pH 4. Figure 6 showed that Pt50-PEI catalyzed
the oxidation of TMB with H2O2 to generate a
characteristic absorption peak at 652 nm (A = 0.488)
which corresponded to blue oxTMB solution.41 However, other groups were still colorless and the absorbance (A = 0.046) was lower than 0.488, indicating the absence
of oxTMB. These results demonstrated that the Pt50-PEI
NPs catalyzed the oxidation of TMB in the presence of H2O2, indicating their peroxidase-like activity. In addition,
the bottom of the bottle was clear, suggesting the high stability
of Pt50-PEI NPs in the catalytic process. Stable Pt50-PEI NPs in aqueous solution tend to have more available
active sites. TMB molecules and H2O2 molecules
were absorbed on the active sites of Pt NPs. The free electron was
transferred from TMB to H2O2 on the active sites
of Pt NPs. Platinum NPs decorated on nickel- and nitrogen-doped graphene
nanotubes also have peroxidase-like activity; the corresponding groups
have obvious absorbance at 652 nm.42 In
short, Pt50-PEI NPs had significant peroxidase-like activity.

of different solutions: [TMB + H2O2], [TMB +
Pt50-PEI], [H2O2 + Pt50-PEI], and [TMB + Pt50-PEI + H2O2] and (b) corresponding solution. Pt50-PEI NPs
had peroxidase-like activity.

2.3 Catalytic Activity
Generally, the
catalytic activity of natural enzymes is dependent on their structure
and conformation, which were influenced by the surrounding conditions
(pH and temperature). Herein, the effects of pH values (from 2 to
12) and the temperature (from 10 to 60 °C) on the catalytic activities
of Pt50-PEI were carefully investigated, respectively.
As shown in Figure 7a, the maximum relative activity of Pt50-PEI was pH 4.0.
Thus, pH 4.0 was optimal pH values for the TMB oxidation reaction,
which was similar to those of other NPs.43,44 In addition, as shown in Figure 7b, when the temperature was from 10 to 60 °C,
the catalytic reaction reached the highest relative activity at 30
°C. In short, pH 4.0 and temperature 30 °C were the optimal
conditions and were chosen for subsequent experiments.45−47

Figure 7 Effects
of (a) pH and (b) temperature on the catalytic property
of Pt50-PEI. The optimal conditions were pH for 4.0 and
temperature for 30 °C.

2.4 Kinetic and Mechanism Study
Furthermore,
the peroxidase-like catalytic performance of Pt50-PEI with
H2O2 or TMB as substrates was measured using
the steady-state kinetics. The enzymatic kinetic parameters were measured
under conditions with altering concentrations of H2O2 or TMB while fixing the other one invariable. The initial
reaction rate was calculated on the basis of the production of oxTMB
over time. The molar absorption coefficient of oxTMB was 39,000 M–1·cm–1. As shown in Figure 8a and Figure 8b, the initial reaction rate
(v) of Pt50-PEI was dependent on the substrate
(TMB or H2O2) concentration. Both curves confirmed
that the catalytic reaction of Pt50-PEI followed a typical
Michaelis–Menten equation. MoS2–Pt74Ag26, Fe-doped CeO2 nanorods, and PVP-functionalized
ultra-small MoS2 NPs also exhibit typical Michaelis–Menten
kinetics.48−50 As shown in Figure 8c,d, the 1/v was proportional to 1/H2O2 concentration and 1/TMB concentration, respectively.
The Michaelis constant (Vmax and Km) was shown in Table 1. The Vmax values
toward TMB of Pt50-PEI NPs were much bigger than that of
HRP, indicating that Pt50-PEI NPs had higher catalytic
activity than HRP. The high catalytic activity should be due to free
access to the active sites of NPs for the substrates. Water-soluble
PEI enhanced the stability of small Pt NPs, while PEI should not occupy
the active sites of Pt NPs. It has been reported that PVP was strongly
adsorbed onto the surface of NPs, and surface-adsorbed PVP blocked
reactant molecules to access the active sites of NPs.51 Chen and co-worker found that the peroxidase-like activity
of graphene oxide–Fe3O4 magnetic nanocomposites
follows a ping-pong mechanism.52 The peroxidase-like
activity of Pt50-PEI NPs should also follow a ping-pong
mechanism. In short, Pt50-PEI NPs had typical Michaelis–Menten
equation for the catalytic oxidation of TMB.

2.5 Glucose
Detection
The Pt50-PEI-catalyzed TMB to generate
blue oxTMB which had an obvious absorbance
peak at 652 nm in the UV–vis spectra. Thus, the concentration
of oxTMB can be calculated based on its absorbance at 652 nm. The
concentration of oxTMB was proportional to H2O2 concentration. It has been reported that the H2O2 concentration was dependent on the glucose concentration
in the glucose oxidase (GOD)-catalyzed reaction in the presence of
glucose and oxygen. Thus, combining two catalytic reactions using
Pt50-PEI and GOD, the concentration of oxTMB should be
dependent on the glucose concentration. Figure 9a showed that the absorbance of oxTMB at
652 nm was positively correlated with the glucose concentration which
was from 10–5000 μM. The standard response equation of
glucose concentration was A = 0.0485Cglucose + 0.191. The detection limit was 4.2 μM, which was relatively
small when it was compared with other reported NPs (Table 2). Cysteine-modified MoS2 nanoflakes (Cys–MoS2 NFs) were used for
the colorimetric detection of glucose with a detection limit for 33.51
μM and the linear range from 0.05–1 mM.54 The high stability of Pt50-PEI NPs was good
for the quick color change of TMB. Saliva was used as the real sample
to test the glucose concentration. The glucose concentration was 0.15
mM, which was within a normal glucose concentration of human saliva
(0.008–0.21 mM).55 This confirmed
the validity of this method. Thus, a sensitive colorimetric method
for glucose detection was established based on the peroxidase-like
activity of Pt50-PEI NPs.

Furthermore, selectivity of glucose
detection was evaluated by
using maltose, fructose, and lactose as control groups. The concentrations
of glucose and other sugars were 5 and 10 mM, respectively. As shown
in Figure 9b, the absorbance
of control groups was much lower than that of glucose when the concentration
of glucose was half of that of other sugars. Thus, this detection
method had high selectivity toward glucose, which was because of the
specificity of GOD toward the catalytic oxidation of β-d-glucose to gluconic acid using molecular oxygen.56 In addition, the developed method showed acceptable
reproducibility. In short, a selective method using Ptn-PEI NPs was demonstrated. Compared with the electrochemical
method, a colorimetric method using Ptn-PEI NPs has many merits such as convenience, low cost, simplicity,
and practicality.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
PEI (70,000) was used as a template to construct water-soluble,
stable, and monodispersed Ptn-PEI NPs.
Based on the peroxidase-like activity of Pt50-PEI NPs,
a highly sensitive method for the detection of glucose concentration
was established. The size of Pt NPs inside Ptn-PEI NPs ranged from 3.21 to 3.70 nm. Pt50-PEI NPs
had a hydrodynamic size of ∼25 nm and slightly positive charge.
Furthermore, Pt50-PEI NPs showed peroxidase-like reaction,
which was used to detect the glucose concentration. This detective
method had a linear glucose concentration range from 10 to 5000 μM,
low detection limit, and high selectivity. The concentration of glucose
in saliva was tested to be 0.15 mM. The suitable molecular-weight
PEI was used to keep high stability of Pt NPs (3.21 nm) inside of
Pt50-PEI NPs in solution. Pt50-PEI NPs could
be prepared in large scale because of affordable price. This high
stability of Pt50-PEI NPs was beneficial to the sensitive
detection of glucose concentration in the solution system. Our future
work will focus on the relationship between surface groups of soluble
macromolecules and the catalytic ability of metal NPs. This established
method has great potential to be used for glucose detection in the
future.

4 Methods
4.1 Synthesis of Ptn-PEI NPs
The synthesis of Ptn-PEI NPs was as follows: as for Pt50-PEI
NPs, 357 μL
of K2PtCl4 (2 mM) aqueous solution and 1000
μL of PEI solution (pH = 4.0, 1 mg/mL) were mixed and added
in a PE tube. As for Pt100-PEI NPs, 357 μL of K2PtCl4 (2 mM) aqueous solution and 500 μL
of PEI solution (pH = 4.0, 1 mg/mL) were mixed and added in a PE tube.
As for Pt150-PEI NPs, 535.5 μL of K2PtCl4 (2 mM) aqueous solution and 500 μL of PEI solution
(pH = 4.0, 1 mg/mL) were mixed and added in a PE tube. The molar ratio
of K2PtCl4 to PEI was 50:1, 100:1, and 150:1,
respectively. All the tubes were located in a constant temperature
metal mixer at 20 °C for 20 min. Then, NaBH4 (1 mg/mL)
solution was dissolved in 0.3 M NaOH and added into each tube. The
amount of NaBH4 was 135 μL for Pt50-PEI
NPs, 135 μL for Pt100-PEI NPs, and 203 μL for
Pt150-PEI NPs. After 10 min, the solution was tuned to
a pH of 7 with 1 M HCl. The solution was shaken at 500 rpm for another
3 h. Each group solution was collected and dialyzed against ultrapure
water to obtain Ptn-PEI NPs (n = 50, 100, 150).

4.2 Catalytic Activity
The catalytic
activity of Pt50-PEI NPs under different pH (2.0–12.0)
was evaluated as follows: 200 μL of Pt50-PEI (6 μM)
and 800 μL of HAc-NaAc buffer (pH 2.0–12.0, 0.2 M) were
incubated for 10 min; 200 μL of TMB (0.6 mM) was mixed for 10
min; Then, 200 μL of H2O2 (0.3 M) was
added for 10 min. The absorbance was recorded at 652 nm. The catalytic
activity of Pt50-PEI NPs under different temperatures (10–60
°C) was carried out with the same procedure at pH 4.0.

4.3 Michaelis–Menten Kinetic Analysis
The effect
of the H2O2 concentration (0.039–0.177
mM) and TMB concentration (0.018–0.357 mM) on the catalytic
activity of Pt50-PEI was studied at 30 °C, respectively.
Briefly, the kinetic assays of Pt50-PEI with H2O2 as the substrate were performed by adding 25 μL
of Pt50-PEI (2 μM), 1400 μL of TMB (0.8 mM),
and different amounts of H2O2 (3 M). The kinetic
assays of Pt50-PEI with TMB as the substrate were performed
by adding 100 μL of Pt50-PEI (6 μM), 300 μL
of H2O2 (0.3 M), and different amounts of TMB
solution (0.2 M HAc-NaAc, pH 4.0). Catalytic parameters were determined
based on Michaelis–Menten eq 1. 1  

4.4 Glucose
Detection
(a) GOD (100 μL,
5 mg/mL) and glucose (200 μL) solutions with different concentrations
were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, the glucose was dissolved
in HAc-NaAc buffer (pH = 5.2, 0.2 M); (b) 800 μL of TMB (0.6
mM) and 100 μL of the Pt50-PEI solution (6 μM)
were mixed at 30 °C for 5 min. This (b) solution was added into
300 μL of (a) solution, the mixed solution was incubated at
30 °C for 30 min, and the absorbance was recorded at 652 nm.
Glucose (5 mM) and other sugars (10 mM) were also measured to compare
the selectivity of this method. The glucose concentration of saliva
was measured using our method.
