Multifunctional integration
on single upconversion nanoparticles
(UCNPs), such as the simultaneous achievement of imaging, sensing,
and therapy, will be extremely attractive in various application fields.
Herein, we demonstrated that single core/shell NaGdF4:Yb/Er-based
UCNPs (<10 nm) with a highly Yb3+ or Nd3+ doped shell simultaneously exhibited good upconversion luminescence
(UCL), temperature sensing, and photothermal conversion properties
under 980 or 808 nm excitation, respectively. The spatial separation
between the emission/sensing core and the heating shell was able to
tailor the competition between the light and heat generation processes,
and hence higher UCL efficiency and enhanced heating capability were
achieved by introducing the rational core/shell design. Especially,
Nd3+-sensitized core/shell nanoparticles were excitable
to the laser at a more biocompatible wavelength of 808 nm, and hence
the heating effect of water was greatly minimized. The heating and
sensing capabilities of Nd3+-sensitized core/shell UCNPs
with smaller sizes (<10 nm) were confirmed in aqueous environment
under single 808 nm laser excitation, implying their promising applications
in imaging-guided and temperature-monitored photothermal treatments.

Introduction
Upconversion nanoparticles
(UCNPs) possess unique luminescence
properties of emitting visible light under near-infrared (NIR) light
excitation and therefore can be widely applied in various fields from
bioprobing to photovoltaics.1−5 In comparison with traditional luminescent nanomaterials including
organic dyes and quantum dots, UCNPs have numerous advantages for
bioapplications, such as improved penetration depth, minimized autofluorescence,
low radiation damage and cytotoxicity, high chemical and optical stability,
etc. UCNPs also can act as an ideal multifunctional platform capable
of simultaneous multimodality imaging or simultaneous imaging, detection,
and therapy. Lin et al. synthesized NaYF4:Yb/Tm@NaGdF4:Yb core/shell nanoparticles, which could be used for X-ray
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and upconversion
luminescence (UCL) trimodal imaging.4 Sun
et al. designed multifunctional NaLuF4:Yb/Tm@NaGdF4:153Sm core/shell UCNPs for four-modality imaging,
including CT, MRI, UCL, and single-photon emission computed tomography
imaging.5 The incorporation of UCNPs and
mesoporous silica could combine diagnosing and treating capabilities
within a single platform and achieve controlled drug delivery and
multimodal imaging at the same time.6−8 Moreover, UCNPs could
be coupled to magnetic, metal, or semiconductor nanostructures to
construct multifunctional nanocomposites capable of utilizing their
distinct properties or coupling effects.9−11

The simultaneous
achievement of a variety of functions on individual
UCNPs would be highly desired for their applications. In UCNPs, such
as intensively investigated hexagonal (β) phase NaYF4:Yb/Er, only less than 1% of absorption energy is converted into
upconversion emissions.12 Most of the absorption
energy is released via downconversion luminescence or heat generation.
In this regard, single UCNPs also can be considered for photothermal
treatment applications if the heat generation is efficient enough.13 Photothermal nanomaterials are capable of precise
and selective nanoscale heating, which can be widely applied to cancer
treatments, data storage and microflow driving in microfluidic chips.14,15 The intensively investigated photothermal conversion materials include
metal nanostructures, semiconductor quantum dots, and carbon nanomaterials.16−19 In comparison with these photothermal nanomaterials, UCNPs exhibit
unique advantages for practical applications. On the basis of their
temperature-sensitive fluorescence, UCNPs demonstrate certain capability
for nanoscale temperature sensing.20−24 In combination with their particular upconversion
emissions, UCNPs are able to simultaneously behave as optical nanoheaters,
temperature nanosensors, and luminescent probes. The integration of
temperature sensing and optical imaging functions on photothermal
nanomaterials is very beneficial to photothermal therapy, allowing
for dynamic control over treatment processes and parameters. Temperature
reading by the heating nanoparticles during therapeutic processes
will be of vital importance to minimize the collateral damage arising
from undesirable overheating. The visible upconversion emissions are
conducive to proper location of photothermal nanoparticles inside
the targeted cells. In addition, on the basis of their inherent photothermal
conversion capability, our group demonstrated that core/shell or composite
UCNPs exhibited obvious UCL color shifts as exposed to a commercially
available NIR laser, thus allowing for producing more secure anticounterfeiting
patterns with simple authentication methods.25,26

As has been previously mentioned, multifunctional UCNPs with
heating,
sensing, and UCL properties exhibit potential applications in various
fields. A few studies reported the photothermal conversion properties
of lanthanide-doped fluoride nanoparticles.15,27−32 For example, Carrasco et al. synthesized highly Nd3+ doped
LaF3 downconversion nanoparticles and demonstrated the
feasibility of their applications in temperature-controlled photothermal
tumor treatments.27 Marciniak et al. designed
NaNdF4@NaYF4@NaYF4:1%Nd3+ core/shell nanoparticles, which were capable of combining efficient
photothermal conversion and highly sensitive temperature probing on
single nanoparticles.28 In comparison with
downconversion luminescence nanomaterials, UCNPs featured with NIR
light excitation will be a more ideal choice for the multifunctional
integration on individual nanoparticles. Our group demonstrated that
NaGdF4:Yb/Er UCNPs with smaller sizes (<10 nm) simultaneously
showed UCL, thermal sensing, and photothermal conversion properties.29 Suo et al. reported that YF3:Tm/Yb
microcrystals showed great potential for applications as real-time
thermal sensors and photothermal agents.30 It is noteworthy that high-power laser radiation has to be used
for reaching the adequate temperature increase, and thus further improvements
of the heating capability of UCNPs are necessary. The heat generation
process directly competes with the luminescence process, and normally
the heating capability is improved at the expense of the luminescence
efficiency. The core/shell structural design provides an effective
route to balance the competition between the heating and luminescence
processes and thus offers the possibility of achieving enhanced photothermal
conversion and high luminescent efficiency at the same time. Tong
et al. synthesized NaYF4:Sm/Yb@ NaYF4:Er/Yb
core/shell nanoparticles (>20 nm), in which the core and shell
acted
as the heating center and temperature sensing unit, respectively.31 However, the UCL efficiency of the outmost NaYF4:Er/Yb shell would be unavoidably affected by the surface
quenching process. Ximendes et al. designed more interesting LaF3:Yb/Er@LaF3:Nd core/shell UCNPs (∼30 nm),
in which the shell behaved as the heating unit and the emission core
provided the temperature sensing function.32 It is worth noting that these core/shell UCNPs showed larger particle
sizes (>20 nm) that were not optimal for biological applications.
UCNPs with smaller sizes and promising luminescence/sensing/heating
properties will be highly desired in the biomedical field for the
target of fast body clearance of nanoparticles and minimized interference
with cellular systems.33 Although the integration
of simultaneous heating and temperature sensing also can be achieved
by coupling lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (as thermal sensors) with
metal, magnetic, or carbon nanostructures (as heating units), these
nanocomposites normally suffer from complicated nanostructures, tedious
synthesis procedures, and larger sizes.9,10,34 The simultaneous achievement of UCL, thermal sensing,
and heating features on single small-sized UCNPs (<10 nm) is still
worth further studies by engineering the core/shell design.

In Yb/Er upconversion systems, the NIR excitation light is mainly
absorbed by the sensitizer Yb3+. The absorbed energy can
be released through three possible routes: energy transfer to Er3+ ions for upconversion emissions, downconversion luminescence,
and nonradiative transition (Figure 1). Nonradiative transitions, between various energy
levels of Er3+ ions or between excited and ground states
of Yb3+ ions, are responsible for the heat generation in
Yb/Er codoped nanoparticles. One straightforward way to enhance the
heating capability is to increase their absorption coefficients and
nonradiative transition rates through the incorporation of high-concentration
Yb3+ ions into UCNPs. Unfortunately, the homogeneous doping
of Yb3+ ions at high levels will result in the decline
of UCL due to the concentration quenching effect.29 Spatial separation distribution between sensitizer and
emitter ions by the core/shell design provides an effective approach
to maintain the UCL intensity and at the same time enhance the heating
capability of UCNPs. Herein, NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaYbF4 and NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Nd/Yb core/shell UNCPs
with smaller sizes (<10 nm) were successfully synthesized by a
layer-by-layer strategy. The shell highly doped with Yb3+ or Nd3+ ions could play a variety of roles: transferring
the harvested energy to the emission core, protecting the core from
the surface quenching, and acting as a heating unit (Figure 1a). The Yb/Er codoped core
provided UCL and temperature sensing features. The Yb3+ or Nd3+-sensitized core/shell UCNPs were demonstrated
to simultaneously show promising UCL, temperature sensing and photothermal
conversion properties under 980 or 808 nm excitation, respectively.
Especially, NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Nd/Yb core/shell
UCNPs could be excited by the light at a more biocompatible wavelength
of 808 nm, and in this case the self-heating effect of water was greatly
minimized. The heating and sensing capabilities of the Nd3+-sensitized core/shell UCNPs were also investigated in aqueous environment
under 808 nm excitation.

core/shell UCNPs,

Results and Discussion
Yb3+-Sensitized Core/Shell UCNPs
Our previous
work showed that NaGdF4:Yb/Er UCNPs simultaneously possessed
UCL, thermal sensing, and heating capabilities.29 However, they still need the relatively high-power laser
for reaching a considerable temperature rise. Therefore, further studies
are necessary to increase the heating capability of NaGdF4:Yb/Er UCNPs without affecting their UCL properties. In Yb/Er codoped
UCNPs, the excitation energy is mainly absorbed by Yb3+ ions. Except for energy transfer to Er3+ ions for upconversion
emissions, the other unused absorption energy is dissipated via downconversion
luminescence (DCL) and nonradiative transition of Yb3+ ions
(Figure 1b). To improve
the heating capability of NaGdF4:Yb/Er UCNPs, one possible
approach is to restrain the DCL process of Yb3+ ions. For
this end, other acceptor ions (Ce3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Nd3+, Tb3+, and Tm3+)
were deliberately doped as quenching centers and their influences
on photoluminescence and heat generation properties of NaGdF4:Yb/Er nanoparticles were studied (Figure S1). These doping ions are chosen because they have close energy levels
to the 2F5/2 excited state of Yb3+. It was found that the incorporation of these acceptor ions had
weak effects on the heating capability of NaGdF4:Yb/Er
UCNPs (Figure S1), probably due to inefficient
energy transfer from Yb3+ to these doped ions. As could
be found, the doping of these lanthanide ions resulted in the significant
decrease of UCL; however, it had a relatively weak effect on the DCL
of NaGdF4:Yb/Er UCNPs (Figure S1). The UCL decline can be attributed to the cross relaxation process
between Er3+ and these doped ions.35−37

With
increasing the Yb3+ concentration in UCNPs, both the absorption
rates to the excitation light and the nonradiative transition rates
of Yb3+ ions will be increased. Therefore, it can be expected
that the heating capacity will be greatly increased for NaGdF4:Yb/Er UCNPs at high Yb3+ levels. However, high
Yb3+ concentrations also will result in the decrease of
UCL due to the concentration quenching effect and the back energy
transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+.29 To simultaneously achieve enhanced UCL and photothermal
conversion properties, NaGdF4:0.2Yb/0.02Er@NaYbF4 (hereafter Yb/Er@Yb) active-core/active-shell UCNPs were designed
and prepared via a layer-by-layer method.38 Their spectroscopic, heating, and thermal sensing properties were
investigated in comparison with the core nanoparticles. To maximize
the light absorption rates of UCNPs, the Yb3+ concentration
in the shell was set to 100%. As shown in Figure 2, well-dispersed NaGdF4:Yb/Er
core nanoparticles had an average diameter of ∼5.6 nm. The
size of Yb/Er@Yb core/shell UCNPs increased to ∼9.6 nm after
the NaYbF4 shell growth, indicative of an active-shell
thickness of ∼2 nm. Both core-only and core/shell UCNPs were
confirmed to show a hexagonal crystal structure (Figure S2). The NaYbF4 shell in our study was grown
by a successive layer-by-layer technique, and during the shell growth,
the precursor concentration was kept low enough to restrain secondary
nucleation. The Yb/Er@Yb core/shell structure was also beneficial
for the synthesis of small-sized UCNPs with higher Yb3+ contents, as NaYbF4 alone tended to grow into big nanoparticles
unsuitable for many applications (>150 nm, Figure S3).

Figure 3a represents
UCL spectra of core-only and core/shell NaGdF4-based UCNPs
dispersed in the cyclohexane solution. Excited at 975 nm, the UCL
spectra were basically composed of green and red emission bands peaked
at ∼525, 545, and 660 nm, which could be assigned to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions
of Er3+, respectively (Figure 1b). It should be noted that the UCL intensity
of Yb/Er@Yb core/shell UCNPs was ∼10 times higher than that
of the core nanoparticles. This significant UCL enhancement is due
to the passivation action of the NaYbF4 shell, which can
effectively inhibit the quenching effect caused by surface defects
or surface-attached ligands. In addition, the NaYbF4 layer
can absorb more excitation energy and then transfer to the NaGdF4:Yb/Er core, thus leading to the increase in the UCL intenisty.39

UCL spectra and (d) plots of ln(RHS) vs
1/T for Yb/Er@Yb core/shell UCNPs dispersed in the
cyclohexane solution. Temperature-dependent UCL spectra were normalized
to the peak intensity at ∼545 nm for clarity.

The NaYbF4 shell also can greatly increase
the photothermal
conversion properties of UCNPs. Under the 975 nm laser irradiation
with a power density of ∼7.6 W/cm2, an obvious temperature
rise (ΔT) was detected for the cyclohexane
solution of Yb/Er-doped core or core/shell UCNPs (Figure 3b). Both the pure cyclohexane
and the cyclohexane solution of pure NaGdF4 nanoparticle
(without the Yb/Er doping) exhibited a weak temperature increase of
1–2 °C at the same irradiation condition. It indicated
that the measured temperature rise for Yb/Er-doped UCNPs was not caused
by the direct absorption of the thermocouple to the laser radiation.
The temperature rise of the cyclohexane solution of Yb/Er@Yb core/shell
UCNPs was up to ∼11.5 °C, significantly higher than in
the case of NaGdF4:Yb/Er core UCNPs (∼4.9 °C).
The increase in the heating capability of core/shell UCNPs is attributed
to their increased absorption to the 975 nm light, arising from the
introduction of the NaYbF4 shell. Moreover, because the
Yb3+ concentration in the shell is extremely high, the
nonradiative transition probability is increased and the shell can
effectively act as a heating unit. The results confirm that the emission-core/heating-shell
design provides a promising solution for the simultaneous enhancement
of UCL and heating capabilities on NaGdF4-based UCNPs.

Figure 3c shows
temperature-dependent green emission spectra of the cyclohexane dispersion
of Yb/Er@Yb UCNPs. With the rise of temperature, the relative contribution
of the 525 nm emission band also increased. It is due to the fact
that 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 energy
levels of Er3+ ions are thermally coupled and the relative
population of these two excited states follows a typical Boltzmann’s
distribution. The intensity ratio (RHS) from 525 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 545 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) emission bands can be written as20 1  where ΔE is the energy
separation between 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and C is
a constant. On the basis of temperature-dependent UCL spectra, the
ln(RHS) versus 1/T relationship
of Yb/Er@Yb core/shell UCNPs was calculated and shown in Figure 3d. According to eq 1, a good linear relationship
(ln RHS = 1.96 – 940.5/T) could be fitted, indicating that Yb/Er@Yb core/shell
nanoparticles were applicable for temperature measurements through
monitoring the intensity ratios of two green emission bands.

Because of very high Yb3+ levels in the shell of Yb/Er@Yb
core/shell UCNPs, the back energy transfer from Er3+ to
Yb3+ probably occurs at the interface between the core
and shell, thus affecting the UCL efficiency of core/shell CUNPs.
We also synthesized NaGdF4:0.2Yb/0.02Er@NaGdF4@NaYbF4 (named as Yb/Er@Gd@Yb) active-core/inert-shell/active-shell
UCNPs (size ∼12.5 nm, Figure S4),
in which the inert NaGdF4 layer was introduced to suppress
the back energy transfer from Er3+ ions in the core to
Yb3+ ions in the NaYbF4 shell. As shown in Figure 3a, the UCL of Yb/Er@Gd@Yb
UCNPs was more intensive by a factor of approximately 3 than that
of Yb/Er@Yb nanoparticles. However, the incorporation of the NaGdF4 layer resulted in the decrease of the heating capability.
As shown in Figure 3b, the temperature increase of the cyclohexane solution of Yb/Er@Gd@Yb
UCNPs was up to ∼9.0 °C, lower than that of Yb/Er@Yb UCNPs
at the same irradiation condition. The decline in the heating capability
for Yb/Er@Gd@Yb UCNPs is due to the fact that the inert NaGdF4 layer (thickness ∼2 nm) dilutes the system and thus
reduces the effective heating volume of UCNPs.

As can be observed,
both UCL and photothermal conversion properties
of NaGdF4-based UCNPs can be improved by the introduction
of the NaYbF4 shell. These Yb3+-sensitized core/shell
UCNPs simultaneously possess thermal sensing, enhanced upconversion
emission, and heating capacities, thus showing a good prospect for
practical applications in various fields. However, the absorption
band of the sensitizer Yb3+ is located at ∼980 nm,
which is overlapped with the absorption band of water. Continuous
irradiation near 980 nm also would lead to the significant temperature
increase of water (∼18 °C, Figure S5). In this case, Yb3+-sensitized UCNPs with multiple
functions are limited to be used in nonaqueous environment or in solid
state, such as for anticounterfeiting applications.25,26 For applications in the biomedical field, the water absorption to
the ∼980 nm laser will cause possible thermal damages to normal
biological tissues.40−42 UCNPs that can be excited at more biocompatible wavelengths
within so-called biological windows40 and
at the same time possess promising UCL/sensing/heating properties
will be highly desired for biomedical applications.

Nd3+-Sensitized Core/Shell UCNPs
Nd3+-sensitized
UCNPs can be effectively excited at more biocompatible
wavelengths near 800 nm, and in this case, the laser-induced heating
effect of water will be obviously reduced in comparison to that under
conventional ∼980 nm excitation.40−46 Meanwhile, the absorption cross section of Nd3+ ions
at ∼800 nm is 10 times higher than that of Yb3+ at
∼980 nm,41 which also favors the
UCL and photothermal conversion processes. Herein, UCL, photothermal
conversion, and temperature sensing properties of Nd3+-sensitized
core/shell UCNPs with smaller sizes (<10 nm) were also investigated.

NaGdF4:0.2Yb/0.02Er@NaGdF4:0.1Yb/xNd core/shell nanoparticles (hereafter Yb/Er@Yb/Nd, x = 0.1–0.7) were successfully synthesized through
a layer-by-layer procedure (Figure 4a–c). For the target of increasing the energy
transfer efficiency from Nd3+ ions in the shell to Yb3+ ions in the core, the Yb3+ ions with a concentration
of 10 mol % were also doped into the shell. The sizes of Yb/Er@Yb/Nd
core/shell nanoparticles increased to ∼9.6 nm in comparison
with core nanoparticles (∼5.6 nm, Figure 2a), implying a NaGdF4:Yb/Nd shell
thickness of ∼2 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
showed that all the Yb/Er@Yb/Nd samples had a hexagonal crystal structure
(Figure 4d). With increasing
the Nd3+ concentration x, the XRD peaks
of core/shell UCNPs shifted to lower values of the diffraction angle,
indicative of the increase of crystal interplanar spacing due to the
larger atomic radius of Nd3+ (0.1123 nm) than that of Gd3+ (0.1075 nm).

Figure 4 TEM images of (a) Yb/Er@Yb/0.1Nd, (b) Yb/Er@Yb/0.5Nd,
and (c) Yb/Er@Yb/0.7Nd
core/shell UCNPs (scale bar: 50 nm). (d) XRD patterns of NaGdF4:Yb/Er core-only and Yb/Er@Yb/xNd core/shell
UCNPs. The standard XRD pattern of the hexagonal-phase NaGdF4 (JCPDS Card No. 27-0699) is also presented for comparison.

In Yb/Er@Yb/Nd core/shell UNCPs,
the excitation energy is mainly
absorbed by Nd3+ ions and then transferred to Er3+ ions in the core through the Nd3+ → Yb3+ → Er3+ path, leading to upconversion emissions
of Er3+ ions (Figure 1b). Therefore, the Nd3+ content in the shell
has a direct and significant effect on the UCL properties of Yb/Er@Yb/Nd
UCNPs. As shown in Figure 5a,b, the UCL intensities of Yb/Er@Yb/xNd
UCNPs (x = 0.1–0.7) increased with increasing
the Nd3+ concentration (x), reaching a
maximum at x = 50 mol %. A further increase in the
Nd3+ concentration resulted in the decline of the UCL intensity.
An optimized intensity at the Nd3+ concentration of 50%
results from the competition among various energy transfer processes.47 First, the UCL process will benefit from higher
Nd3+ levels, at which both the absorption rate of UCNPs
and the energy transfer rate from Nd3+ to Yb3+ are increased. However, at higher Nd3+ concentrations,
the deactivation process of Nd3+ ions also will be accelerated
due to the increased cross relaxation between them. A balanced effect
might occur at an optimized Nd3+ concentration of 50%,
beyond which the detrimental effect surpasses the beneficial effect
and thus results in the UCL decline. In addition, the harvested energy
of Nd3+ ions also can be deactivated by the surface quenching
process. To obtain strong upconversion emissions, higher Nd3+ concentrations are needed for the smaller-sized core/shell nanoparticles
because of the increased surface quenching effect to Nd3+ ions. Consequently, the optimized Nd3+ concentration
(∼50%) in this work is higher than the reported values (∼30%)
in the Nd3+-sensitized NaYF4-based core/shell
UCNPs with lager particle sizes.47,48

UCNPs under 808 nm excitation; (b) UCL intensities
as a function of the Nd3+ content in the colloidal Yb/Er@Yb/xNd core/shell UCNPs. (c) The 808 nm laser-induced heating
(ΔT) as a function of the irradiation time
and (d) as a function of the Nd3+ concentration for the
cyclohexane solution of Yb/Er@Yb/xNd core/shell UCNPs
(power density: ∼7.6 W/cm2).

Except for the UCL, part of absorption energy of Nd3+ ions can be released in heat through the nonradiative deactivation
process. The Nd3+-doped shell of Yb/Er@Yb/Nd UCNPs also
can behave as the heating unit, and the heating capacity of nanoparticles
is demonstrated in Figure 5c,d. Figure 5c illustrates the temperature rise curves of Yb/Er@Yb/xNd nanoparticles dispersed in cyclohexane (λex =
808 nm, power density = ∼7.6 W/cm2). It should be
noted that the pure cyclohexane solution exhibited a negligible temperature
rise (ΔT ∼1 °C) under 808 nm excitation.
The obvious temperature rise (ΔT) could be
detected for the cyclohexane solution containing Nd3+-sensitized
core/shell nanoparticles. For instance, the temperature rise of Yb/Er@Yb/0.5Nd
nanoparticles dispersed in cyclohexane was up to ∼10.2 °C
when exposed to the 808 nm laser over a period of 15 min. The heating
capacities of Yb/Er@Yb/xNd core/shell UCNPs increased
monotonously with increasing the Nd3+ concentration (Figure 5d). The laser-induced
temperature rise (ΔT) depends on the harvested
excitation energy by UCNPs as well as the proportion of absorbed energy
dissipating in heat. Both absorption coefficients and nonradiative
transition rates are increased at higher Nd3+ concentrations,
resulting in the enhancement of the heating capacity of core/shell
UCNPs. The strong Nd3+ concentration dependence of heating
capacity also reveals that the Nd3+-doped shell is the
main responsible source for the temperature increase of the nanoparticle
solution when irradiated with the 808 nm laser.

The cyclohexane
dispersion of Yb/Er@Yb/0.7Nd UCNPs exhibited a
temperature rise of ∼12.7 °C under 808 nm excitation with
a power density of ∼7.6 W/cm2, higher than that
of Yb/Er@Yb UCNPs (∼11.5 °C) under the same measuring
conditions except excitation at 975 nm. It should be noted that Nd3+ ions are only distributed in the shell of Yb/Er@Yb/0.7Nd
UCNPs and by a simple calculation, the average concentration of Nd3+ ions in Yb/Er@Yb/0.7Nd UCNPs is 35% lower than that of Yb3+ ions in Yb/Er@Yb UCNPs. The results indicate that Nd3+-sensitized UCNPs have an increased heating capacity than
that of Yb3+-sensitized ones, owing to the relatively larger
absorption cross section of Nd3+.

Figure 6a represents
green emission bands of Er/Yb@Yb/0.5Nd nanoparticles upon 808 nm excitation
at various temperatures. It was also found that the relative intensity
of the ∼525 nm band increased with the rise of temperature.
On the basis of the data of ln(RHS) versus
1/T (Figure 6b), a linear relationship (ln RHS = 2.26 – 1085.4/T) could be fitted
according to eq 1. The
results indicate that small-sized Er/Yb@Yb/Nd UCNPs (<10 nm) are
also capable of simultaneously integrating UCL, temperature reading,
and heating functions on single nanoparticles. However, because of
the presence of oleate ligands on the nanoparticle surface, these
hydrophobic UCNPs cannot be well dispersed in aqueous media. Therefore,
surface modifications to render these oleate-capped UCNPs dispersible
in the aqueous phase are needed prior to the biological applications.

solution of Yb/Er@Yb/0.5Nd core/shell UCNPs.

Temperature Sensing and Heating Properties of UCNPs in Water
The temperature sensing and heating performances of Er/Yb@Yb/Nd
UCNPs were further explored in the aqueous medium to mimic the intracellular
measuring conditions. Water-soluble surface modifications of Nd3+-sensitized core/shell UCNPs were accomplished via a ligand-free
method previously reported in the literature.49 The oleate ligands attached to the surface of as-prepared Er/Yb@Yb/Nd
UCNPs were removed through a straightforward acid treatment. The removal
of oleic acid ligands from the particle surface could be confirmed
by the disappearance of absorption peaks at ∼2924 and ∼2853
cm–1 in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
(Figure S6), which originate from symmetric
and asymmetric stretching vibration of methylene (−CH2−) in long alkyl chain, respectively.49,50 The TEM image showed that after the removal of oleic acid, the morphology
and mean particle size of Er/Yb@Yb/Nd UCNPs remain essentially unchanged
and no obvious agglomeration was found (Figure S6). Ligand-free Er/Yb@Yb/Nd UCNPs could be well dispersed
in water to form transparent colloidal solution, which was stable
without obvious sedimentation (the inset of Figure S6).

Figure 7a shows the heating curves of aqueous solutions of Er/Yb@Yb/xNd UCNPs under the 808 nm laser irradiation. It was clearly
found that the self-heating effect of water was negligible (<1
°C) under 808 nm excitation, in comparison to that under 975
nm excitation (∼18 °C, Figure S5). Significant laser-induced temperature rise was found for the aqueous
solutions of Er/Yb@Yb/xNd UCNPs with various Nd3+ concentrations. For instance, the temperature rise (ΔT) of Er/Yb@Yb/0.7Nd UCNPs was up to ∼10.3 °C
under 808 nm excitation. Compared with UCNPs dispersed in cyclohexane,
the slight decrease of the temperature rise in the aqueous solution
may be due to the larger specific heat capacity of water.

Figure 7 (a) Heating
(ΔT) curves of aqueous solutions
of Er/Yb@Yb/xNd UCNPs under 808 nm excitation (power
density: ∼7.6 W/cm2); (b) plots of ln(RHS) vs 1/T for the aqueous solution of
Yb/Er@Yb/0.5Nd core/shell UCNPs.

On the basis of upconversion emission spectra of Er/Yb@Yb/0.5Nd
UCNPs at various temperatures in the aqueous medium (Figure S7), the ln(RHS) values
as a function of 1/T were calculated and shown in Figure 7b. In line with eq 1, a linear fitting (ln RHS = 2.01 – 987.8/T)
was obtained in the aqueous solution. For these luminescent nanothermometers,
the thermal sensitivity (SR) can be described
by the relative variation of the emission intensity ratios with temperature27 2  On the basis of the data
shown in Figure 7b,
the thermal sensitivity
of Er/Yb@Yb/0.5Nd UCNPs in water was calculated to be about 1.2 ×
10–2 °C–1 at 30 °C,
which was close to the thermal sensitivities reported in other Er3+-activated UCNPs.32,48 It should be noted
that the thermal sensitivity of green emissions of Er3+ ions does not vary significantly with changes in the sensitization
ions (Yb3+ or Nd3+) or the dispersing media
(water or cyclohexane) (Figure S8). The
above results indicate that Er/Yb@Yb/Nd UCNPs with small sizes (<10
nm) are able to behave, at the same time, as luminescent probes, temperature
nanosensors, and heating agents. Moreover, Er/Yb@Yb/Nd UCNPs are excitable
at ∼800 nm and will be more suitable for the biological applications
by avoiding the self-heating effect of water. This combination makes
Er/Yb@Yb/Nd UCNPs more promising single platforms for dynamically
controlled thermal treatments under the single-wavelength laser excitation.

Conclusions
NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaYbF4 and
NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Yb/Nd core/shell UCNPs with
smaller sizes
(<10 nm) were successfully prepared via a layer-by-layer strategy.
Upconversion emission, temperature sensing, and heat generation properties
of these UCNPs were investigated. The NaYbF4 shell could
play the role of a heating unit and at the same time protected the
emission core from the surface-related quenching effect. Therefore,
enhanced heating capability, increased UCL intensities, and good temperature
sensing properties were achieved on single core/shell UCNPs of NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaYbF4. For NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Yb/Nd core/shell UNCPs, the highly Nd3+-ion doped
shell behaved as the heating unit and simultaneously transferred absorption
energy to the core for upconversion emissions. The strong dependencies
of photothermal conversion and UCL properties on the Nd3+ content in the shell were revealed. Nd3+-sensitized core/shell
UNCPs with 808 nm excitation showed much lower heating effect of water,
and their heating and temperature reading capabilities were demonstrated
in the aqueous medium. These core/shell UCNPs were able to simultaneously
act as luminescent probes, heating agents, and temperature nanosensors,
showing great potential for applications in imaging-guided and temperature-monitored
photothermal treatments.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Core-Only
and Core/Shell UCNPs
NaGdF4:Yb/Er core nanoparticles
were synthesized using a co-precipitation
method.51 Lanthanide acetates, sodium hydroxide,
and ammonium fluoride were used as starting materials, which reacted
at 295 °C in the mixed solvents of oleic acid (OA) and 1-octadecene
(ODE) to prepare core nanoparticles. A modified layer-by-layer method
was adopted to synthesize NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaYbF4 and NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Nd core/shell UCNPs.38 Sodium trifluoroacetate and lanthanide acetates
were dissolved in OA and the OA/ODE mixture, respectively, to prepare
the shell precursors. Subsequently, certain amounts of the shell precursors
were alternately injected to the reaction solution containing the
as-prepared core nanoparticles to synthesize core/shell UCNPs. The
reaction temperature for the shell growth was decreased to 290 °C
to avoid homogeneous nucleation. Detailed synthesis procedures and
parameters could be found in our previous work.26,29

Preparation of Ligand-Free UCNPs
A previously reported
ligand-free protocol was used to transfer oleate-capped NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Nd/Yb UNCPs into the aqueous phase.49 First, oleate-capped core/shell nanoparticles
(50 mg) were dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water and then the HCl
aqueous solution (0.1 M) was added drop wise to adjust the pH value
to 4. Subsequently, the mixed solution was sonicated for 2 h at the
pH value of 4 to protonate the carboxylate groups of oleate ligands.
In the following, the aqueous solution was blended with diethyl ether
and the generated oleic acid molecules were removed by extraction.
The procedure was repeated several times until the solution became
totally clear. The ligand-free nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation
at 9000 rpm after precipitation with acetone. After washing several
times with acetone, the ligand-free core/shell UCNPs were finally
dispersed in deionized water to form a transparent solution.

Characterization
A Tecnai G2 transmission electron
microscope was used to observe the particle size and morphology. The
crystalline phase of UCNPs was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements on a Shimadzu XD-3A X-ray diffractometer. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of UCNPs were measured on a Nicolet 5700 FTIR
spectrometer. Continuous 975 or 808 nm diode lasers were used as the
light sources for UCL spectra and photothermal conversion measurements.
The nanoparticle solution was added into a 10 mL quartz cuvette, and
UCL spectra under the laser irradiation were measured by a Maya2000Pro
portable spectrometer. For temperature-dependent UCL spectra measurements,
the quartz cuvette containing the nanoparticle solution was heated
by a resist-heating hot stage and the temperature was determined by
a thermocouple that was immersed into the nanoparticle solution. For
photothermal conversion measurements, the volume of the nanoparticle
solution was fixed at 2 mL, with the concentration of 20 mg/mL. The
diameter of the laser beam at the sample position was ∼5 mm,
and the laser power density was ∼7.6 W/cm2. The
temperature rise of the nanoparticle solution during the laser irradiation
was measured by a thermocouple with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C.
