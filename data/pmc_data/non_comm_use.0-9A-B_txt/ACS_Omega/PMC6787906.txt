Biosurfactants
based on carbohydrates are of special interest because
of their production from renewable resources, nontoxicity, biocompatibility,
and environmental friendliness. Dodecyl polyglucosides, a type of
nonionic surfactant synthesized with methyl polyglucosides obtained
from the eco-friendly subcritical methanolysis of renewable resource
of starch, is no doubt good for ecosystem. With the subcritical methanolysis
of starch, the methyl polyglucosides were obtained without any catalyst.
Under the reaction condition of the weight ratio of methanol to starch
of 7.5, temperature of 220 °C, and reaction time of 2 h, the
yield of methyl polyglucosides was 85%. Dodecyl polyglucosides were
synthesized by transglycosidation with methyl polyglucosides, and
the green nonionic surfactant has excellent surface activity. The
critical micelle concentration and hydrophilic lipophilic balance
are 0.022 wt % and 12, respectively.

Introduction
Because of the nontoxicity, excellent
biocompatibility, and environmental
friendliness, biosurfactants have broad applications. The biosurfactants
based on carbohydrates are of special interest because of their production
from renewable resources and sound ecological effects.1−6 One type of biosurfactant is alkyl polyglucosides (APGs) with a
glucose unit.7 They are nonionic surfactants
produced from renewable resources such as corn, potatoes, and wheat.8−11 Owing to their antibacterial activity, high surface activity, low
toxicity, dermatological compatibility, and biodegradability, they
are widely used in many fields including washing, cleaning, and cosmetics.12−16

In recent years, the common material used for the synthesis
of
APGs is glucose, which is traditionally produced from starch and cellulose
with complex process.17−22 Therefore, the direct utilization of starch or cellulose to produce
APGs is no doubt an advantageous process. It is known that β-glycosidic
linkages of sugar molecules contained in the cellulose chain are strongly
protected by the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, whereas
the corresponding linkages in starch are weaker. The direct chemical
conversion of cellulose as treated in supercritical methanol resulted
in complex products.23 Therefore, APGs
are easier to produce with starch as the raw material rather than
cellulose.

Up to now, the main method to synthesize APGs from
starch is the
Fischer method, which includes direct glycosylation and transglycosidation.24,25 Zou et al. synthesized isooctyl polyglucosides directly from starch
as raw material.26 However, for the synthesis
of longer-chain APGs, the direct synthesis is very difficult due to
the compatibility between sugar and long-chain alcohol. The transglycosidation
method with methyl polyglucosides is an important method, that is
to say it should first obtain methyl polyglucosides from starch. The
traditional methanolysis of starch should adopt acid or alkali as
a catalyst, and the process will result in environmental pollution
and difficulty in separation of products.

Super- and subcritical
fluid is a high-activity medium and its
utilization in depolymerization is getting more and more attention.27−29 To avoid the disadvantages of traditional acid or alkali catalyst,
the depolymerization of starch with subcritical methanol to obtain
methyl polyglucosides is studied. The efficient method is eco-friendly
and easy to use for the separation of products as there is no need
of any catalyst in the methanolysis process. With the obtained methyl
polyglucosides, the transglycosidation of 1-dodecanol produces the
final products of dodecyl polyglucosides more easily.

Results and Discussion
Methanolysis
Products
Owing to the high activity of
the subcritical methanol, the first reaction occurs between alcohol
and the terminal units of starch, with the release of water and then
hydrolysis of water to starch. The general methanolysis process should
be the reaction of the hydroxyl group of starch with that of methanol
to condense into an ether linkage (C–O–C). The Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the methanolysis products are
given in Figure 1.
The characteristic absorption in the range of 1120–1170 cm–1 gives the ether linkage, and the peak at about 1146
cm–1 is the characteristic absorption peak of alkyl
polyglycosides resulting from ether linkage,30,31 which indicates OH condensation.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of the starch and methanolysis
product (220 °C,
2 h, and the weight ratio of methanol to starch 7.5).

The structures of the methanolysis products were determined
by
the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum as given
in Figure 2. The chemical
shift of H2O is 4.790 ppm. The peak of δ 3.383 ppm
shows the presence of three protons of methyl group (A1) and one proton
of the glucose ring (B2). The peaks ranged from δ 3.511 to 3.849
ppm, indicating that the three protons of the glucose ring (B1, B3,
B4) and the two protons of the methylene group (B5) are linked. The
one proton of the glucose ring (B6) linked to the hydroxyl group of
methanol is shown in the peak of δ 5.186 ppm. The hydroxyl groups
could not be observed obviously because of the hydrogen–deuterium
exchange. The 1H NMR spectrum is in accordance with the
molecular structure of methyl polyglucosides.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectrum
of the methanolysis product (220 °C,
2 h, and the weight ratio of methanol to starch 7.5).

Typical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) spectra
are
shown in Figure 3.
The elution order of solutes in HPLC is governed by the degree of
polymerization (DP) and alkyl chain length of APGs. Due to the use
of reversed-phase C18 column, solutes with a longer alkyl chain length
and bigger DP are proved to have a shorter retention time. As for
the methanolysis products, there is main peak at around 3.171 min
similar to the standard methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside
(DP = 1), indicating that the main methanolysis product should be
methyl glucoside (DP = 1).

Figure 3 HPLC spectra of the standard methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside
and methanolysis product (220 °C, 2 h, and the weight ratio of
methanol to starch 7.5).

Except the main peak,
the peaks at around 1.392, 2.349, and 2.724
min should result from polysaccharides and other methyl polyglucoside
with DP = 2 and 3.

According to the normalization of peak areas,
the contents of methyl
polyglucosides with DP of 1, 2, and 3 are calculated on the basis
of eq 1. 1  Ai is the peak
area of methyl polyglucosides with DP of 1, 2, and 3. ∑A is the total area of methyl polyglucosides with DP of
1, 2, and 3. The response coefficients (R2) of DP1, DP2, and DP3 were 0.9987, 0.9953, and 0.9881, respectively.

According to the normalization of peak areas, the contents of methyl
polyglucosides with DP of 1, 2, and 3 are 64, 21, and 15%, respectively.
Thus, the average DP of 1.51 for methyl polyglucosides can be calculated
by eq 2 2  

Yield of Methyl Polyglucosides Depending
on Reaction Conditions
As for the methanolysis of starch,
the first reaction occurs between
alcohol and the terminal units of starch to release water; then, water
hydrolyzes starch to give a low degree of polymerization of methyl
polyglucosides. Methanol acts both as a reactant and a solvent in
the process. Therefore, the weight ratio of methanol to starch, reaction
temperature, and time should play important roles on the methanolysis
of starch to obtain methyl polyglucosides. The yield of methyl polyglucosides
can be expressed as ma/me × 100%, where ma and me are the experimental and theoretical weights
of methyl glucoside, respectively. As for the theoretical weight,
1.1975 g of methyl glucoside can be obtained with the methanolysis
of 1 g of starch.

First the reaction time of 2 h was studied
to determine appropriate weight ratio of methanol to starch and reaction
temperature. The yield of the methyl polyglucosides with different
weight ratios of methanol to starch is given in Figure 4 at 220 °C and 2 h. It shows that with
the weight ratio of methanol/starch increasing, firstly the yield
gradually increases and it attains around 85% under the weight ratio
of methanol/starch 7.5 and subsequently the yield almost remains unchanged.
Therefore, the weight ratio of methanol/starch 7.5 should be fit to
obtain high yield of methyl polyglucosides.

Figure 4 Yield of methyl polyglucosides
with different weight ratio of methanol
to starch (220 °C, 2 h).

Owing to that too high temperature will result in many side reactions
and the temperature range of 180–260 °C was studied. Figure 5 gives the yield
of methyl polyglucosides at different temperatures. It shows that
the yield increases to the maximum 85% at the reaction temperature
of 220 °C and with increasing temperature further, the yield
decreases. It should be that the higher temperature will result in
side reactions such as the carbonization of starch and the polymerization
of glucose. Especially for the temperature of 260 °C, the color
of products is much more yellow than that of 220 °C. Thus, the
temperature of 220 °C is appropriate.

Figure 5 Yield of methyl polyglucosides
with different temperature (2 h,
the weight ratio of methanol to starch 7.5).

The reaction time range of 1–3 h is studied and the result
is shown in Figure 6. First the yield increases with the increase of time and at the
reaction time of 2 h, the yield attains the highest yield of 85%.
Whereas as the reaction time further increases to 2.5 h, the yield
decreases to 78%. When reaction time is too long, the side effects
of hydrolysis and polymerization of methyl polyglucosides will occur,
and the colored substances in products will increase and make the
products dark brown. The result indicates that to ensure high yield,
the reaction time of 2 h should be suitable and also temperature of
220 °C.

Figure 6 Yield of methyl polyglucosides with different time (220
°C,
the weight ratio of methanol to starch 7.5).

According to the above results, the yield of methyl polyglucosides
was 85% when the methanolysis condition was reaction temperature 220
°C, reaction time 2 h and the weight ratio of methanol to starch
7.5.

Transglycosidation Products
FTIR spectrum of transglycosidation
products is shown in Figure 7. The peak of 1142 cm–1 are the characteristic
absorption peak of alkyl polyglycosides resulted from ether linkage.

Figure 7 FTIR spectra
of the starch and transglycosidation product.

Different from the methanolysis product, the transglycosidation
product was dissolved in chloroform-d (CDCl3) solvent, and their 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Figure 8. The chemical shift
of the CDCl3 solvent is 7.260 ppm. The peaks of δ
0.876, 1.253, and 1.616 ppm belong to the three protons of the methyl
group (A1), the sixteen protons of methylene group (A2, A3, A4, A5,
A6, A7, A8, A9), and the four protons of the methylene group (A10,
A11), respectively. The one proton of the glucose ring (B6) linked
to the hydroxyl group of 1-dodecanol is shown in the peak of δ
5.076 ppm. The peaks in the range from δ 3.841 to 4.305 ppm
are a result of other twelve protons (A12, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, C1,
C2, C3, C4). The peaks of the 1H NMR spectrum are in accordance
with the molecular structure of dodecyl polyglucosides.

Figure 8 1H NMR spectrum of the transglycosidation product.

The HPLC spectra are given in Figure 9. The remain time from low to high should
be residual 1-dodecanol, polysaccharide, and dodecyl polyglucosides
of DP = 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The response coefficients (R2) of DP1, DP2, and DP3 were 0.9962, 0.9918,
and 0.9839. According to the normalization of peak areas, the contents
of dodecyl polyglucosides with DP of 1, 2, and 3 are 67, 18, and 15%,
respectively; thus, the average DP of 1.48 of dodecyl polyglucosides
can be calculated by eq 3 3  

Figure 9 HPLC spectra of the standard dodecyl glucopyranoside and
transglycosidation
product.

According to the above results,
the main transglycosidation product
was dodecyl polyglucosides and their yield was 83%.

Critical Micelle
Concentration (CMC) and Hydrophilic Lipophilic
Balance (HLB) Values of the Dodecyl Polyglucosides
The critical
micelle concentration (CMC) and the hydrophilic lipophilic balance
(HLB) value of the desired products dodecyl polyglucosides were studied.
According to the curve of the surface tension of the aqueous solution
versus the corresponding logarithm of concentrations, the related
parameters can be obtained.

Figure 10 shows the general trend that the increase
of the concentration of dodecyl polyglucosides first leads an obvious
decrease in surface tension and then gradually becomes constant. The
value of the CMC is determined from the intersection of the two dashed
lines obtained by linear fitting. Thus, the CMC is 0.022 wt % and
the corresponding surface tension is 32.42 mN/m. The result is in
accordance with the CMC value of 0.2 wt % of isodecyl glucoside studied
by Nilsson et al., who pointed out that the CMC approximately decreases
by a factor of 10 when the hydrophobic chain was increased by two
carbons.32

Figure 10 Curve of surface tension
versus logarithm of concentration of dodecyl
polyglucosides at 25 ± 1 °C.

The HLB value can be calculated by the empirical eq 4 according to the method of W. C.
Griffin.33 Thus, the HLB value of dodecyl
polyglucosides products as calculated by eq 5 was 12. A comparison of the HLB of 12 to
that of isooctyl glucoside of 17,26 the
dodecyl polyglucosides have better lipophilicity owing to four carbons
in its hydrophobic chain. 4   5  

Conclusions
Subcritical methanolysis of starch and transglycosidation to produce
green nonionic surfactants benefits the sustainable development owing
to renewable resources. Starch alcoholysis in subcritical methanol
to obtain the main products of methyl polyglucosides and transglycosidation
with 1-dodecanol can obtain dodecyl polyglucosides, which have the
CMC of 0.022 wt % and HLB of 12. The process can use renewable starch
to produce alkyl polyglucosides to avoid traditional glucose material,
which first need to hydrolyze starch firstly.

The yield of methyl
glucoside can reach 85% at the temperature
of 220 °C and reaction time of 2 h in the subcritical methanolysis
of starch. Owing to no need of any catalyst such as a strong acid
in the methanolysis process, the method is eco-friendly and quite
efficient in separating the main methanolysis products. The residual
starch is separated by filtration and excess methanol is removed with
distillation; the methanolysis product is used to synthesize dodecyl
polyglycosides, and the yield of the main transglycosidation products
of dodecylglucopyraoside is 83%.

Experimental Section
Materials
Reagents including starch, 1-dodecanol, methanol, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, and 30wt % hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Standard methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside
(degree of polymerization, DP = 1) and dodecyl glucopyranoside (DP
= 1) were purchased from Crystal Pure Industrial Co. Ltd (Shanghai,
China). All reagents were used as purchased without further purification.

Subcritical Methanolysis
Some weight ratio of starch
and methanol were mixed under ultrasonic dispersion. Subcritical methanolysis
of the mixed sample was carried out in a stainless steel batch type
autoclave reactor with an inner volume of 20 mL, and the total volume
of all samples put into the vessel was about 15 mL to maintain appropriate
pressure and keep a relatively smooth reaction. After the desired
reaction temperature and time were achieved, the reactor was taken
out from the furnace and quenched in ice-water bath to stop the reaction
immediately in ambient temperature. The solid including residual starch
and liquid after reaction were separated by filtration. The liquid
product was distilled to remove excess methanol, and it was used to
synthesize dodecyl polyglycosides.

Synthesis of Dodecyl Polyglycosides
The liquid product
of the above methanolysis was put into a three-necked flask containing
about 1.0% weight ratio of p-toluene-sulfonic acid
as catalyst. After heating to 110 °C, 1-dodecanol, with twice
the weight of the liquid product of methanolysis preheated to 60 °C,
was added slowly for 30 min. The mixtures were then stirred at 110
°C to react for about 1 h, and methanol produced during the process
of the transglycosidation of 1-dodecanol was removed by distillation.

After the reaction, the excess 1-dodecanol was removed by distillation
at 150 °C under 1000 Pa vacuum degree. Then, the residual liquid
products underwent oxidative decoloration with 30 wt % hydrogen peroxide
(about 5% weight ratio in all all liquids) at the temperature of 85
°C and for 2.5 h to give light-yellow products.34,35 Finally, the product of dodecyl polyglycosides was obtained after
sodium borohydride was added to decompose excessive hydrogen peroxide
and the pH adjusted to 8.

Analysis of the Products
Methanolysis
and transglycosidation
products were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1H-nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
FTIR spectra were recorded on an Avater 370 FTIR spectrograph (Nicolet
Co.). 1H NMR spectra were recorded by an AVANCE 500 MHz
(Bruker Co., Germany) digital spectrometer operating at 500 MHz with
the products dissolved in deuterium oxide (D2O) and chloroform-d (CDCl3).

The HPLC was carried out with
Aglient 1200, which is coupled with reversed-phase C18 column (250
mm × 4.6 mm × 5 μm), and a UV–vis detector
was employed to determine the wavelengths of 205 and 216nm, respectively.
The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol/water (50:50, v/v) at a
flow rate of 1 mL/min and methanol/water (60:40, v/v) at a flow rate
of 0.5 mL/min, respectively. The autosampler with the injection volume
was set to 1 μL and the column temperature was maintained at
25 °C.

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) values
of the prepared
APGs were determined using surface tension and interfacial tension
methods. The surface and interfacial tensions of the final product
solutions were measured using the video optical contact angle measuring
instrument at temperature of 25 ± 1 °C.
