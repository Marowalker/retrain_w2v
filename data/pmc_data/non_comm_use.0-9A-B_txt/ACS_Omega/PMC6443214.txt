Lignin is a renewable biopolymer
considered as a potential precursor
for low-cost carbon materials. Thermal oxidative stabilization (TOS)
is an important processing step to maintain fiber geometry during
carbonization, yet the impact of  TOS on the properties of lignin-based
carbon materials has not been clearly identified in the literature.
Yield, change in fiber diameter/distribution, elemental composition,
and mechanical properties were explored for both stabilized and carbonized
lignin fibers. Vibrational spectroscopy and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to analyze the
changes in lignin molecular structure after exposure to various heating
conditions during the TOS steps. Further, studies were focused on
the effects of TOS conditions on the resulting carbon structure of
fiber mats through Raman spectroscopy measurements and electrical
conductivity analysis. Although TOS conditions influenced the properties
of the oxidized lignin fiber mats, properties of the carbonized
samples were invariant to the TOS procedures used in this study over
most of the conditions. As a result, there was flexibility for the
parameters (time and temperature) in the TOS process when conditioning
softwood lignin materials for carbon fibers.

Introduction
Lignin is the second
most abundant natural polymer after cellulose
constituting about one fourth of the cell wall of plants. It is obtained
as a byproduct in the pulp and paper industry as well as in developing
second-generation bioethanol industry. Currently, recovery of softwood
kraft lignin, on a semi-industrial scale, is done by three companies
in North America producing more than 100 t/day. Pulping conditions
and two patented recovery options1,2 impact the
structure and the breakdown products; however, all the lignins isolated
come from softwood resources. These lignins are generally viewed favorably
for carbon fiber production with their ability to undergo thermal
oxidative stabilization (TOS); the lignin is derived from the polymerization
of mainly coniferyl alcohol and the resulting guaiacyl lignin
has open positions on the aromatic rings for carbon–carbon
bonds. This structure creates opportunity to undergo significant cross-linking
during stabilization for the production of lignin-based fiber
materials from softwood kraft lignin.3

Only a small percentage, less than 2%, of the 50 million tons of
lignin produced from the pulp and paper industry is utilized, with
the remainder used as fuel in the chemical recovery furnaces.4 Current applications of industrial lignins include
dispersants, emulsion stabilizers, concrete additives, surfactants,
and binders.5 However, several decades
of research has allowed improvements in properties of lignin-based
materials by investigating the relationships between the heterogeneous
structure and the molecular properties of different lignins, including
processability and performance.6 Still,
there has been little commercial progress in lignin materials based
on its potential to serve as a feedstock for renewable materials.
Yet, with its relatively high carbon content, it is seen as a great
precursor for carbon fiber, which as been studied as far back as 1969.7

The impetus to utilize lignin lies in the
fact that it is a byproduct
of a current industrial process and would potentially reduce the environment
footprint of materials such as carbon fiber sourced from fossil resources.
Carbon fibers have numerous potential applications, including not
only structural applications such as aviation, aerospace, automotive,
and wind power but also nonstructural applications such as thermal
management, catalyst supports, electrodes for batteries (Li-ion batteries,
fuel cells), and supercapacitors.8 Not
only the abundance qualifies lignin for its application in carbon
fiber, but also compared with other carbon fiber precursors, lignin
is already oxidized and allows for stabilization at a rate that is
faster than pitch. This shortened cross-linking stage and relatively
high carbon yield reduces the manufacturing costs.9 Therefore, this low-cost, renewable, and abundant material
has been highlighted to serve a potential role as a precursor for
carbon fibers as a substitute for petroleum-based commercial precursors.10,11

Traditionally, lignin-based carbon fibers have been produced
in
micron-sized fibers by melt spinning or dry spinning methods.9,12 These carbon fibers had heterogeneous cross sections with defects,
with a lack of orientation between the crystalline planes resulting
in lower mechanical properties than petroleum-derived carbon fibers.13 Recently, gel spinning has been investigated
to enhance fiber properties.14 Another
approach to address these issues involves forming nanoscale fibers
by electrospinning, which is a simple method to produce fiber with
reduced defects, high surface area, and potentially highly oriented
molecules in the fibers.15,16 Electrospinning of
various lignin solutions has been reported for carbon fiber production
yielding fibers with the above characteristics.12

One issue of carbonizing fibers, especially with
nanoscale diameters
is the loss of fiber geometry during heating. Hence, thermal oxidative
stabilization (TOS) is critical for carbon fiber production unless
there are nanoscale additives placed in the fiber.17 TOS helps reduce further thermal degradation and prevents
the fusion of individual fibers prior to further heat treatment, i.e.,
carbonization, by inducing additional oxygen into the lignin structure.9,18 Essentially, this process results in thermoset fibers from thermoplastic
fibers.19 Moreover, the TOS process is
considered to be the most important step because it largely governs
the final carbon structure of the fiber and hence its ultimate mechanical
properties. There are just a few studies that show the effects of
TOS process parameters on properties of lignin powder20 or ground samples from lignin-based fibers.18,21,22 Most of the TOS studies focused
on micron-sized lignin fibers produced by extrusion with respect to
stabilization time;18,21−23 these studies
would have different impact compared to high surface area to volume
nanoscale fibers. Although a study showed statistical analysis of
the impact of carbonization process on properties of carbon nanofibers,24 there is a dearth of studies that report how
the TOS process affects properties of the final carbonized lignin
fibers. Whereas most of TOS studies focused on chemical structural
changes of thermally stabilized fibers after various temperatures
and final carbon structure of the subsequently carbonized micro-sized
fibers, they did not show the effect on the mechanical properties
of carbonized nanoscale fibers or fiber mats.18,20−23

With the growing interest in carbonized electrospun lignin
fiber
materials,11,12 it is unclear if there is a dominant
factor for TOS that controls the performance of the carbon fibers
or fiber mats. Considering the high surface area of fibers, and their
change in structure with high temperature treatment, this class of
materials may behave differently due to the surface area to volume
differences. In this study, the effect of TOS on the properties of
carbonized nanofibers and nanofiber mats were explored including yield,
change in diameter/distribution, elemental composition, internal structure,
and mechanical performance as a function of stabilization temperature,
rate, and time. The novelty of the research integrates the fundamental
knowledge of lignin oxidative processing on the important properties
of carbonized fiber related to both its mechanical and electrical
performance.

Results and Discussion
Influence of TOS Parameters
on Stabilized Lignin Nanofiber Mats
Among different design-of-experiments-based
techniques, two-level
factorial design experiments (2FD) are the most effective  for
the optimization of parameters in specific engineering applications.25 This analysis can help identify the effects
and interactions of relatively few variables (2–4 variables)
or to analyze the most significant parameter from many variables (over
5 variables). In the current study, a 2-level factorial design with
3 variables (2FD3, 23), which included final temperature,
holding time, and heating rate, was used to determine the impact on
yield after the thermal oxidative stabilization (TOS) process. Ranges
for these experiments were chosen such that the final hold temperature
was high enough to cause some degradation to the lignin26 but not too significant to cause serious weight
loss based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data, as shown previous
literature. Holding time was chosen based on literature for TOS of
softwood lignin, whereas heating rate was analyzed from previous lignin-based
fiber studies.9,27 Based on this analysis, the most
influential parameter on the yield after the TOS was found to be the
final temperature (Table 1). Experimental data showed that mass loss after the oxidative
processing increased with increasing final temperature for both heating
rates (Figure 1). Furthermore,
holding time had a greater impact on mass loss than heating rate.
These data were different from the literature for lignin materials
(powder and micron-scale fibers), as Brodin et al. reported that holding
time was the most influential factor on yield after the TOS process.22 Moreover, there was minimal influence on the
interaction among the parameters on yield, as the dominant effect
was the single parameter of the final holding temperature. Temperatures
used in this study were similar to torrefaction temperatures in the
literature, which were great enough to cause some decomposition with
loss of water (dehydration) and carbonaceous gas (CO and CO2) release, along with compounds such as methanol and methane from
loss of methoxy groups.28

stabilization parameters and their
interactions on their responses and yield (X1: temperature, X2: holding
time, and X3: heating rate).

were averaged from triplicates.

As expected, higher temperatures caused mass loss during the TOS
process, and this affected the morphology of the fibers. As seen in
the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Figure 2, the TOS nanofibers after
lower final temperatures at 200 and 230 °C had their original
shapes compared to the control samples without the thermal treatment
(Figure S1). Further, lignin nanofibers
after TOS at higher temperature, above 250 °C, showed a curved-liked
shape along the fiber axis. This change was evident when the fibers
were exposed to faster heating rates, 5 °C/min, compared to the
slower rate of 1 °C/min. In a previous study based on the in
situ thermal analysis of lignin-based nanofiber mats, the lower heating
rate allowed sufficient time for cross-linking of the lignin prior
to significant softening, whereas the higher heating rate allowed
for greater mobility of the chains prior to thermally induced cross-linking.17

Figure 2 SEM images of  lignin fibers after TOS process under
different
heating rates (1 and 5 °C/min), final temperatures of 200, 230,
250, 280, 300, and 350 °C, and 60 min holding time (scale bar
= 10 μm).

The average fiber diameter
and yield also decreased as a function
of increasing final temperature as shown in Figure 3a,b. Average diameters decreased at higher
TOS temperatures when compared to the initial fiber diameter (Figure 3a). As shown in Figure 3b, yield after TOS
process at various final temperatures decreased with increasing final
temperature. Significant changes in yield, of around 37%, occurred
between 300 and 350 °C when compared to other temperatures. Only
10% yield change occurred between 200 and 250 °C, followed be
a sharp decline between 250 and 300 °C, equating to 23% of mass
change (Figure 3b).

fiber diameter of as-spun and stabilized nanofibers
with various final temperatures and heating rates and (b) yield after
stabilization process by weighing at various final temperatures with
5 °C/min heating rate (p value < 0.05).

The fiber diameter decreased further
for the samples that were
stabilized at 1 °C/min compared to those stabilized at 5 °C/min
heating rate, beyond 300 °C, as indicated in Figure 3a. This result suggested that
a longer heating time, by increased total time for heat exposure,
affected the diameter of fibers.

Effects of TOS Temperatures
on Chemical Composition and Structure
of Stabilized Lignin Nanofibers
Heating lignin in an oxygen-rich
atmosphere impacts lignin’s chemical structure through the
addition of additional oxygen into the compound. As a result, elemental
analysis is an effective way to study the effect of TOS temperatures
on changes in the lignin structure of stabilized lignin fibers. The
elemental composition, i.e., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,
for the lignin composite nanofibers stabilized at different temperatures
is reported in Table 2. No nitrogen was detected except for the stabilized sample at 350
°C (0.48%). For the control sample, either residual protein in
the lignin or residual solvent (N,N-dimethylformamide, DMF) would impact this value. At temperature
above 250 °C, the oxygen content increased with increasing temperature
of thermal stabilization. Braun et al. also reported the effect of
stabilization parameters (temperature and heating rate) on the elemental
composition of lignin.21 They reported
that an increase in oxygen content occurred at treatment temperatures
up to 250 °C, followed by a decrease in oxygen content beyond
250 °C. However, in the current case, the oxygen content increased
even above 250 °C, but content of both carbon and hydrogen decreased
with increasing temperature. This result suggested that TOS proceeded
beyond 250 °C (as opposed to combustion).

Further, the effect of TOS temperature on the change in each element
of stabilized lignin fiber mats (E) was shown as a ratio to the control
mat (E0) (i.e., as-spun is referred as
1) in Figure 4. As
the oxidation process proceeded at higher temperatures, the loss of
carbon content was up to 7% and the hydrogen content decreased significantly
by about 60%. The oxygen content increased by 20% up to 350 °C
compared to the initial content of the as-spun lignin fibers. The
data in Figure 4 indicated
that even at lower temperature of 200 °C with hydrogen loss,
reactive processes occurred with some C–H or O–H bond
cleavage. Although elemental analysis cannot reveal products of the
reaction, lignin is known throughout the literature to readily form
free radicals, which for lignin leads to depolymerization but also
leads to significant repolymerization of the lignin in a cross-linked
structure.29

for stabilized lignin fiber mats
as a function of the thermal oxidative stabilization final temperature
(at the rate of 5 °C/min).

Because TOS causes lignin to undergo cross-linking reactions,
lignin
was no longer soluble for many characterization methods; hence, solid-state
NMR (SS NMR) was used to determine chemical changes in stabilized
lignin nanofibers as previously reported for lignin characterization
of lignin melt-spun fiber31 and melt-blown
spun fiber.32 As shown in Figure 5, 13C cross-polarization/magic-angle
spinning (CP/MAS) SS NMR spectra showed a significant decrease in
∼147 ppm region for various TOS treatments, which indicated
an aryl–ether linkage cleavage, whereas the region for aliphatic
side chain inter-unit carbon (61–83 ppm) almost disappeared
under various TOS treatments. The relative intensity of a peak at
55 ppm (−OCH3) decreased significantly after 280
°C as major reaction occurred in TOS attributed to demethoxylation.
After continued heating at higher temperatures, the signal completely
disappeared after 350 °C treatment. The region from 160 to 170
ppm increased slightly after TOS at 250 °C and showed a broad
band at 350 °C. This region was related to esters and anhydrides
attributed to oxygenation, as found in the elemental analysis, and
cross-linking.31 At 350 °C, the spectrum
showed a broad resonance from 100 to 140 ppm, centered around 124
ppm. These results were similar to those of other reports, with the
loss of significant peak signatures.31

fiber mats after different TOS temperatures.

Similar to solid-state NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy
can be used to characterize the functional groups of solid materials
enhancing the analysis of the changes during TOS of lignin. As shown
in Figures 6 and 7, the relative intensity of various FTIR spectra
absorbance bands decreased with increasing TOS temperature. In detail,
the intensity of the O–H stretching band (νO–H,
∼3600 cm–1) and C–H stretching bands
(νC–H ∼2800 cm–1) decreased
with increasing final TOS temperature. This result was interpreted
because of significant loss of hydroxylated Cγ, typically released
as formaldehyde, and the formation of enol ethers and ketone products,33 along with loss of hydrogen that was reflected
in the elemental analysis (Figure 4). Also, 1510 – 1500 cm–1 decreased
and nearly disappeared at 300 °C, with the modification of aryl
groups as an aromatic vibration mode assignment.34,35 At these higher TOS temperatures, aromatic ring structures had to
be significantly modified after losing 60% of hydrogen based on the
elemental analysis as shown in Figure 4. Also, the intensity of 1218, 1081, and 1033 cm–1 nearly disappeared beyond 300 °C, and these
bands corresponded to C–O of guaiacyl ring, secondary alcohols,
and primary alcohols, respectively.34,35 The intensity
of the carbonyl region was increased with increasing TOS temperature
and shifted to higher frequency from 1707 to 1725 cm–1, and these bands corresponded to the formation of unconjugated carbonyls,
which may explain the increased oxygen content with the loss of some
hydroxyl groups. As the temperature was raised to 300 °C, a new
band appeared at ∼1831 cm–1, which indicated
the formation of anhydride linkages.21,29 As shown in Figure 7 for normalized peak
intensity of each functional groups as a function of temperatures,
changes to the aromatic signal (∼1500 cm–1) began at 230 °C, whereas carbonyl signals (∼1700 cm–1) rapidly increased above 250 °C. In similar
fashion, the guaiacyl ring-stretching modes (∼1270 and 1210
cm–1) stayed nearly constant up to 250 °C,
which dramatically decreased at higher temperatures. These data corresponded
with the loss of methoxy groups at these higher temperatures, as seen
for the 13C NMR data (Figure 5).

Thermal Properties of Stabilized Lignin Nanofiber Mats Treated
under Various TOS Temperatures
TGA analysis of the heat-treated
lignin revealed that the derivative peak temperature and residue increased
with increasing final temperature, as shown in Table 3. As the samples were heated to relatively
higher TOS temperatures, the labile linkages off-gassed, which would
suggest the remaining materials would have improved the thermal stability
of the lignin fiber mat; this result was found by the increased value
of the derivative peak temperature from 382 to 518 °C after thermal
oxidative stabilization.

According
to TGA results (Figure S2),
the as-spun lignin-based fiber mats showed around 15% mass loss at
300 °C and then more significant mass loss was observed above
300 °C (derivative weight peak temperature in Table 3). Statistical analysis of the
results did not reveal a significant difference for the residue (%)
remaining at 1000 °C, with a p value above 0.05
(one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)), which means that all values
are in same range with the large variance. This result was further
correlated with uniformity and stability of composite nanofibers after
the carbonization process. Yield (%) in Table 3 indicated the weight difference before and
after the carbonization process for stabilized lignin fiber mats,
which demonstrated varied responses with the TOS temperature. Hence,
although the final temperature had a significant impact on yield after
stabilization (Figure 3b), it did not impact the yield of the carbonized samples.

Carbonized lignin nanofibers at different TOS temperatures showed
similar morphology, as shown by the SEM images in Figure 8. All samples consisted of
uniform individualized nanofibers; some slightly curved fibers could
also be observed. The carbonization process decreased the average
fiber diameter compared to that of the as-spun fiber as shown in Figure 9. Further, there
was scatter among the average values that revealed different dimensions
for stabilized fibers with different final temperatures during TOS.
However, with the variance it was not clear if individual heating
temperatures impacted the carbonized average fiber diameter. It was
noteworthy to compare differences among stabilized and carbonized
samples. As compared with values in Figure 9, the nanofibers stabilized at 200 °C
showed the largest diameter change of about 28% before and after carbonization.
Also, the TOS temperature at 200 °C gave the lowest yield after
carbonization, and this was constant with the yield value for TGA
results shown in Table 3. The smallest average change in the diameter of carbonized nanofibers
was shown for the nanofibers stabilized at 250 °C; however, there
was significant variance for all nanofibers.

As shown in Figure S3, the elemental
analysis of carbonized lignin fiber mats revealed that TOS had minor
impact on carbon content. Overall, a comparison of the elemental analysis
in Table 2 of the stabilized
fibers with that in Figure S3 shows that
the carbon and nitrogen content in carbonized lignin nanofibers after
carbonization increased from 58–65 to 83–88% and from
0% up to 0.4–0.7%, respectively. The increased nitrogen content
was attributed to the nitrogen flow during the carbonization process.
Also, oxygen and hydrogen content decreased from 30–39 to 10–15%
and from 2–6 to 0.4–0.9%, respectively. Through the
carbonization process, the carbon content was increased but was below
92%, as reported for carbon-based materials.36 The final carbonization temperature of 1000 °C was not high
enough to completely deoxygenate the material under the current test
conditions, but it was still in the carbonization temperature range;
other recently published papers also carbonized at 900–1100
°C for electrospun lignin-based carbon nanofibers.24,37,38 Moreover, it was reported that
the inert gas selection can impact the carbon content and the graphitization
process, as argon has been used for polyacrylonitrile-based carbon
fiber production.39

Mechanical Properties of
Stabilized and Carbonized Fiber Mats
as a Function of TOS Temperature
The overall tensile
properties of the random fiber, as-spun mat improved after heat treatment
in the air atmosphere. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was increased
from 7 MPa up to 29 MPa and modulus was increased from 741 to 1.6
GPa. In Figure 10a,
the samples stabilized at 250 °C showed the highest value of
UTS (29 MPa) and then decreased above 250 °C with increased standard
deviation. Based on the FTIR and NMR data, significant chemical changes,
like forming carbonyl groups, occurred to the lignin above 250 °C,
impacting the strength of the material. Further, the modulus value
showed improved values for different final temperatures after TOS
and also showed the highest value at 250 °C.

Figure 10 Tensile properties of
lignin-based nanofiber mats: (a) analysis
after thermal oxidative stabilization at indicated temperatures and
(b) after carbonization at 1000 °C for various final temperatures
(p value < 0.05 for stabilized samples, but p value > 0.05 for carbonized samples).

For the tensile test of carbonized samples, the
carbon nanofiber
mats stabilized at 200 °C and 350 °C could not be further
analyzed. Both samples stabilized at 200 and 350 °C were too
brittle to prepare specimens for reproducible tensile tests. As shown
in Figure 10b, lignin
carbon nanofiber mats after stabilization at various temperatures
showed little difference in tensile strength and modulus but statistically
no difference in one-way ANOVA analysis (p value
> 0.05). These samples had significant variance, especially at
the
highest TOS final temperature. This result indicated that carbon yield/content
maybe the most critical parameter when evaluating the effect of TOS
final temperature, as it had minimal impact on the final properties
of the carbonized samples heated between 230 and 300 °C. This
observation provides a critical finding that there was flexibility
in the TOS process when creating lignin-based carbon nanofibers from
kraft lignin, as this processing step does not need to be closely
controlled for carbon fiber production within a given range.

It would be worth while to investigate the relationship between
mechanical properties and carbon structure of single-carbon nanofibers.
One work showed significant difference between the tensile properties
of fiber mats and single fibers from softwood kraft lignin source,
similar to this work.40 Compared with lignin-based
carbon fiber mat, single-carbon nanofiber showed 309 ± 39 MPa tensile strength and 34
± 8 GPa tensile modulus. However, dealing with single nanofibers
is challenging for characterization, along with isolating single-carbon
nanofibers. Therefore, it is hard to achieve reasonable tensile properties
with single nanofibers and atomic force microscopy or nanoindentation
is required.

Raman Spectroscopy and Electrical Conductivity
of Carbonized
Lignin Nanofiber Mats as a Function of TOS Final Temperature
Raman spectra of the carbonized mats after various TOS conditions
are shown in Figure 11. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) between D (disordered) band and G (graphitic) band
changed as a function of TOS temperature. As shown in Figure 12a, the ID/IG ratio was significantly decreased
after stabilization at 250 °C, indicating that the graphitic
structure (G band) was more developed after this temperature than
that of carbonized samples that were previously stabilized at 200
and 230 °C. Further, the ID/IG ratio was similar for carbonized samples after
thermal stabilization between 250 and 300 °C. Higher thermal
stabilization temperatures led to a further decrease in the ratio,
suggesting a higher degree of order for carbon mats stabilized at
350 °C. These results indicated that at higher TOS temperature,
graphitic clusters developed in the carbonized lignin nanofibers.
Moreover, the crystallite size (La) was
calculated from the Raman spectra using the following eq 1 1  where R is ID/IG, C is
a function of laser wavelength (2.4 × 10–10) × λ4, and λ is the wavelength of the
incident laser (here 785 nm).41 As shown
in Figure 12a, the
higher temperature in TOS produced larger La of the carbonized lignin nanofibers, and the values were significantly
increased after TOS at 250 °C. The calculated La values in this study were larger or similar to the previously
reported data (25–45 nm) for lignin-based carbon fibers analyzed
with the same laser wavelength.24,42 As shown in Figure 12b, the ID/IG ratio was inversely
proportional to the crystallite size. This relationship agreed with
reported works,41,43 although this difference in ID/IG values did
not greatly impact the mechanical properties of the carbonized nanofiber
mats for this range of ID/IG values.

temperatures in the range from 900 to 1800 cm–1.

and crystallite size from Raman spectra of carbonized lignin nanofiber

Based on previous analysis, larger crystallites was expected
to
have higher electrical conductivity.44 A
multimode device was used to measure the electrical resistance of
thermally stabilized and subsequently carbonized mats as a function
of thermal stabilization temperature. As shown in Figure 13, the carbonized mats had
an electrical conductivity value of nearly 6 S/cm, with a relatively
large variance for the measurements. The statistical analysis showed
no difference among the mean values. This result demonstrated that
the changes in carbon structure did not lead to a uniform conduction
path, where most likely, there was still resistive amorphous carbon
along the individual nanofibers. The values of conductivity were comparable
to other studies with lignin-based carbon nanofiber mats. Carbon fiber
mats from kraft lignin grafted with acrylonitrile showed 7.1 S/cm45 and carbon nanofibers from softwood kraft lignin
had 2.3 S/cm.46,47

Conclusions
The
thermal oxidative stabilization (TOS) processing conditions
(especially the final stabilization temperature) impacted the properties
of stabilized lignin-based fiber mats. Specifically, changes were
observed extensively in chemical, structural, and mechanical properties
of stabilized lignin-based nanofibers or nanofiber mats related to
the addition of oxygen and the loss of hydrogen. Further, loss of
methoxy groups occurred at temperatures above 280 °C during this
stabilization process. However, additional heat treatment of the sample
during carbonization caused the differences that arose in thermally
stabilized lignin performance to become minimum. The properties of
the carbonized lignin-based fiber materials were independent of this
parameter under most of the TOS conditions. It is noted that there
was a minor effect of TOS conditions on the structure of carbonized
lignin nanofibers and/or nanofiber mats, and these differences did
not correlate with changes in mechanical performance. Although surprisingly,
this observation demonstrated that there was flexibility in the thermal
oxidative stabilization process when creating lignin-based carbon
nanofibers in the range from 230 to 300 °C.

Experimental Section
Materials
Organic solvent fractionation of commercially
available softwood kraft lignin (SKL, Indulin-AT, WestRock, Glen Allen,
VA) was carried out by sequential extraction with organic solvents
based on a published procedure.17,48 The 4th fractionated
SKL (F4SKL) from methanol/methylene chloride (70:30, v/v)
extraction was selected for producing lignin-based nanofibers. As
indicated in the Supporting Information (Table S1), molecular weight analysis (Figure S4) and chemical characterization of the lignin (Figure S5) were carried out according to previously
published methods.33,49 Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC)
was produced by authors as described in the published procedure.48 Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with average molecular
weight of 1 × 106 g/mol was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received. N,N-Dimethylformamide
(DMF), methanol, methylene chloride, and sulfuric acid of 98% were
all ACS reagent grade and cellulose filter papers (Whatman No 1001-110)
were also purchased from Fisher Scientific and used as received.

Electrospinning Process
As described earlier,17,48 F4SKL was used as the raw material for electrospinning.
F4SKL/NCC suspension/PEO solutions in DMF were prepared
at 80 °C for 3–4 h in the oil bath. NCC suspension in
DMF was mixed at loadings of 1 wt % with respect to lignin solid weight
as an additive to help control the molecular orientation of the lignin.50 The lignin solution concentration was kept constant
at 27 wt %. Only 1 wt % PEO was added to the solution based on lignin
solid weight to help form consistent fibers.

As described in
the earlier studies,17,48 electrospinning was carried out
in a vertical orientation using a 1 mL syringe fitted with a 25G needle
as a spinneret connected to the positive terminal of a high direct
current (DC) voltage power supply (Glassman HighVoltage, Inc., HighBridge,
NJ). The operating voltage was +20 kV. The collecting distance was
25 cm between the tip of the needle and the collector. An aluminum
foil sheet was used as the collector and connected to the ground.
A syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, Inc. Wantagh, NY) operating
at a flow rate of 0.01 mL/min supplied the polymer solution to the
spinneret.

Thermal Oxidative Stabilization Process
Electrospun
F4SKL/NCC/PEO composites nanofiber mats (1 wt % NCC loading)
were stabilized at 1–5 °C/min to various final temperatures
in a gas chromatography oven (Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II) and
held isothermally for 30–60 min in air. After treatment, the
yield after TOS was calculated gravimetrically. 2 Level Factorial
Design with 3 variables (2FD3) experiments were performed at 2 levels
(LOW and HIGH level, often coded as −1 and +1) with the variables
of final temperature (X1), holding time (X2), and heating rate (X3).
The effects were calculated by summing a response (yield after thermal
stabilization, %) for the factor at a HIGH (+1) level and subtracting
all responses for the factor at a LOW (−1) level.

Carbonization
Process
Thermally stabilized lignin/NCC/PEO
composite nanofiber mats were carbonized at 1000 °C at 10 °C/min
and held isothermally for 60 min in the nitrogen atmosphere using
a GSL-1100X tube furnace (MTI Corp., Richmond, CA). The yield after
carbonization was calculated by weighing the samples.

Characterization
Nanofiber morphology was studied using
Hitachi S3000N scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrospun
nanofiber mats were deposited onto the sample stages using a conductive
carbon tape. The samples were characterized at 5 kV accelerating voltage
with a working distance of 15 mm after sputter coating with 15 nm
thickness of gold (Au) for stabilized fiber mats. The mean and standard
deviation of fiber diameter were calculated from several SEM images,
and 100 fibers were analyzed with a ImageJ software.

Elemental
analysis was conducted with a Carlo Erba Elemental Analyzer EA 1108
with stabilized lignin fiber mats after various TOS conditions and
carbonized fiber mats.

Evidence of the molecular structure change
before and after stabilization
process was analyzed by FTIR. Each of the samples was dried in a vacuum
oven overnight before measurements. The IR spectra were collected
using a Spectrum One FTIR Spectrometer (PerkinElmer), equipped with
Spectrum software, and 32 scans were collected with spectral resolution
of 4 cm–1. The spectra were normalized at 1600 cm–1 for lignin-based fiber mats, and the relative intensity
of absorption bands was measured. As reported in the previous research,
the absorbance at 1600 cm–1 showed a more accurate
spectra collection.35

Solid-state
NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker Advance-400
spectrometer operating at frequencies of 100.61 MHz for 13C and 400.09 MHz for 1H NMR in a Bruker double resonance
MAS probe head at spinning speeds of 16 kHz for all experiments. 13C CP/MAS experiments utilized a 3 μs (90°) 1H pulse, 2 ms contact pulse, 4 s delay, and 2000 scans modified
from earlier work.31

Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed for the as-spun
nanofiber mats, stabilized fiber mats using Q500 TA instruments (New
Castle, DE). Two to three milligrams of nanofiber mats were heated
to 600 °C for the as-spun fiber mats and to 1000 °C for
stabilized fiber mats at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen
flow.

Mechanical tests were conducted for the stabilized and
carbonized
lignin nanofiber mats prepared at different final temperatures at
the heating rate of 5 °C/min. Five sample strips of mats were
prepared with 0.5 cm by 3 cm size and mounted on the tensile test
frames. Prior to mounting, the samples were held in a paper C-clamp
and the support of the clamp was cut prior to the test. The tests
were conducted using a Katotech KES-G1 tensile tester using 500 g
of stabilized fiber mats and 1000 g of load cell for carbonized fiber
mats under 0.01 cm/s deformation rate and voltage constant of 10 V.

Raman spectra of carbonized fiber mats were recorded on a RM1000
Raman Microscope system (Renishaw, Gluocestershire, U.K.) equipped
with a 785 nm diode laser. A total of 2 scans per sample at 1% laser
power were collected in the range of 800–2000 cm–1 using an X50 microscope objective. Baseline correction between data
points in the range was applied before curve fitting. The D-band was
fitted with a Lorentzian line shape and the G band was fitted with
a Breit–Wigner–Fano line shape using Origin 8.5 software.
The ratio of two bands, ID/IG, was calculated as the ratio of the intensities (I,
heights) of the D and G bands.

The DC resistance, R (Ω), of carbon nanofibers
mats was measured by a 2-point probe using a multimeter (Agilent U1272A).
The samples were cut into approximately 1.5 cm length and 0.3–0.6
cm width and painted at each end with silver paint on clean glass
slides. Conductivity was calculated based on the measurement R in Ω and the dimensions of the samples using eq 2 2  where L is the distance between
the nonpainted part in cm, w is the sample width
in cm, and t is the thickness of the sample in cm.
The average values were calculated from the three measurements from
each sample.
