Innovative design
concepts can play a key role in the realization
of high-performance ionomer membranes that are capable of exclusive
metal ion conduction and potentially applicable in electrochemical
devices including sensors, fuel cells, and high-energy batteries.
Herein, we report on the development of new ionomers, based on sulfonated
poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), engineered to conduct a variety
of ions, namely, Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, and Mg2+, when soaked with nonaqueous solvents.
Application of a facile phase-inversion method results in M-SPEEK
(M = Li/Na/K/Zn/Mg) membranes with a hierarchical porous network,
facilitating organic solvent infusion that is necessary to promote
dissociation and rapid transport of cations between anionic sulfonate
groups on the polymer chains. This strategy leads to membranes with
alkali ion conductivities approaching 10–4 S cm–1 at room temperature, and near unity cation transference
numbers (tM+ ≥ 0.9).
Furthermore, an exceptionally high Zn-ion conductivity of 10–2 S cm–1 is obtained for the water-infused Zn-SPEEK
membrane. In comparison, the dense membranes demonstrate 2–3
orders of magnitude lower conductivities because of insufficient solvent
infusion. Preliminary electrochemical studies with solvent-infused
ionomer membranes as the electrolyte look promising.

Introduction
Polymer electrolytes
have enjoyed great deal of attention in the
past 2 decades owing to their potential applications in electrochemical
sensors, electrochromic displays, fuel cells, and high-energy batteries.1 Typically, they are metal salt–polymer
complexes where both cations and anions are mobile. Because only one
type of ion (cation/anion) participates in the electrochemical process,
application of an electric field leads to the accumulation of inactive
ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface. This results in
polarization losses, which is detrimental to the performance of the
electrochemical device.2 Polymeric single-ion
conductors—also termed as ionomers—have one of the ionic
groups covalently tethered to the polymer backbone and thus eliminate
the ionic concentration gradient build-up, resulting in electrolytes
with near unity cation/anion transference number (t+/-). Such electrolytes have been proposed to improve
the performance of metal ion batteries as exclusive metal ion conduction
may not only increase the energy density3 but also stabilize metal deposition at the metallic electrode which
is crucial to prevent dendrite formation.4−7 Lithiated Nafion, a kind of perfluorinated
sulfonate ionomer, is a prime example.8,9 It displays
a Li+ transference number of 0.8–0.9 and a high
Li+ conductivity nearing 10–4 S cm−1 at room temperature, when the Li-Nafion membrane
is infused with liquid organic carbonates, such as propylene carbonate,
ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, or their mixtures.9 Notably, a variety of solid ionomers have been
synthesized to date, but most of them display poor ionic conductivities
(10–6 to 10–8 S cm−1) because of the lack of functional media that can promote Li+ transport between the anionic groups.10 This issue has been addressed by functionalizing the polymer
chain with flexible polymeric unit like PEO (poly ethylene oxide),11−13 which can act as a Lewis base and facilitate the movement of Li
ions through the polymer matrix. In another strategy, the ionomer
is blended with a PEO type soft polymer, which then functions as the
Li+ transporter through Lewis acid–base interactions
with Li ions. However, highest conductivity improvement has been documented
for liquid organic solvent impregnation into the ionomer. The organic
solvent simply assists in the solvation–desolvation-mediated
transport of Li+—same way as the PEO type additive—without
affecting the single-ion conductivity feature.9,14 Unfortunately,
many ionomers do not imbibe liquid organic carbonates, the common
solvents for binary Li-ion electrolytes, well. Therefore, they are
functionalized with highly fluorinated functional groups—either
in the backbone or in the anionic chain9 or blended with fluorinated polymers like polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF),15 to improve their swelling behavior,
which is crucial for high ionic conductivity. The issue concerning
those approaches is that the fluoropolymers can be expensive, and
fluorination at the anionic chain involves complex synthetic strategies.

As we report here, hierarchically porous ionomer membranes of sulfonated
poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) designed by a facile phase inversion
method offer a rigid network of interconnected nanopores. These interconnected
pores efficiently infiltrate liquid organic solvents, which leads
to good ionic conductivities with single-ion conductivity feature.
SPEEK is known as an inexpensive alternative to Nafion in polymer
electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells as a proton conducting electrolyte.16,17 SPEEK has very good thermal stability, and it can be easily synthesized
by sulfonation of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK). Upon exchanging
the proton in the SO3H (sulfonic acid) group for different
metal ions (Figure 1a), we have developed ionomer membranes capable of conducting Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ when soaked with liquid organic carbonates. It is important
to note that no salt is added to the organic carbonates that the membranes
are infused with; therefore, only the metal ions from the polymer
backbone contribute to the ionic conduction through the membranes.
To the best of our knowledge, the development of versatile ionomer
membranes from a simple polymer like SPEEK with potential for application
as nonaqueous electrolytes is so far unprecedented. Remarkably, the
interconnected porous network renders relatively large surface area
of ∼35 m2 g–1, enabling solvent
infusion, which is crucial to promote dissociation and transport of
tethered cations (Figure 1b). The alkali ionomer membranes soaked in liquid organic
carbonates register ionic conductivities nearing 10–4 S cm–1 at room temperature, besides asserting
single-ion conductivity feature (tM+ ≥ 0.9). Solvent polarity is found to influence the
ionic conductivity as exemplified by an impressive 10–2 S cm–1 zinc ion conductivity of Zn-SPEEK membrane
infused with water. Finally, preliminary electrochemical studies demonstrate
reversible metal ion conduction through the ionomer membranes and
manifest the possibility to use the Li-SPEEK ionomer electrolyte in
Li-ion batteries.

Results and Discussion
Ionomer Membrane Preparation and Characterization
PEEK
can be readily functionalized to SPEEK via an aromatic sulfonation
reaction.18 Because the sulfonate groups
(−SO3–) in SPEEK binds covalently
to the polymer backbone, it becomes immobilized in space, but the
counter cation (H+) can move freely. Thus, hydrated SPEEK
serves as a fast proton conductor in PEM fuel cells. The proton of
the −SO3H group can in principle be exchanged with
various metal cations, resulting in different single-ion conductors
(Figure 1a).

The number of sulfonated repeat units in SPEEK can be readily adjusted
by varying the reaction time and temperature (Table S1). In general, a higher reaction temperature and a
longer reaction time result in higher number of sulfonated repeat
units, expressed as the degree of sulfonation (DS). It is known that
SPEEK with a high DS swells heavily in water. A larger counter cation
(Na+) interacts less with water than the proton and consequently
SPEEK with a larger counter cation swells less in water. To simplify
the washing and further processing, as-obtained SPEEK was directly
exchanged to its Na-ion form, referred to as Na-SPEEK, in 2 M NaOH
solution in water. Ion exchange with Li+, K+, Zn2+, and Mg2+ was performed by prolonged
immersion of the Na-SPEEK in the respective chloride solution in water,
resulting in the corresponding ionomer, referred to as Li-SPEEK, K-SPEEK,
Zn-SPEEK, and Mg-SPEEK. While the chemical structure of the polymer
as revealed by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared (Figure S1) is in agreement with previous literature
reports,19,20 the DS could be determined by elemental
microanalysis. For the present study, two different SPEEK samples
have been used; one with a moderate DS (DS = 63%)—referred
to as SPEEK-63 and the second with a high DS (DS = 93%)—referred
to as SPEEK-93. SPEEK samples with lower DS (<50%) were not considered
because they are insoluble in most organic solvents and thus membrane
fabrication was not possible. All of the data presented here correspond
to SPEEK with DS of 63% unless otherwise mentioned.

Thin films
of M-SPEEK (M = Li, Na, K, Mg, and Zn) were casted from
their respective solution in N,N-diethylacetamid (DMAc) on a glass substrate. Subsequent drying of
the films resulted in dense membranes (Figure S3), which upon soaking in liquid organic carbonate showed
extremely poor metal ion conductivities (see below). Note that a sufficient
solvent uptake is necessary because the dry membranes are ionically
blocking, so they behave like an ionic insulator (Figure S4). In water, the dense SPEEK membrane can swell up,
creating percolation pathways for proton conduction (H+ conductivity: 10–50 mS cm–1) between the
hydrophilic clusters. However, aprotic organic solvents are absorbed
insufficiently by the dense M-SPEEK membranes, leading to poor solvation
and mobility of the metal ions. Fluoropolymers like Nafion, where
the fluorinated polymer backbone is relatively more hydrophobic, can
swell up in polar organic solvents, which facilitates dissociation
and transport of metal ions. Thus, a common strategy in the development
of solid–liquid hybrid ionomers is the preparation of a polymer
blend consisting of a large amount (equal or more) of fluoropolymer
like PVDF with the active ionomer to enhance the organic solvent intake.15 Another strategy is the introduction of perfluorosulfonated
groups in the anionic functionality, which not only improve organic
solvent intake but also promote cation dissociation.9,13,21−23 However, the
latter strategy typically involves a complex synthesis. Because our
goal is to move away from expensive fluoropolymers, we have developed
a simple but versatile approach to fabricate high ionic conductivity
ionomer membranes.

Our strategy relies on the design of high
surface area porous membranes,
which were obtained by directly immersing the casted polymer films
into a solvent bath followed by drying (Figure S3). This technique is known as phase inversion via immersion
precipitation in membrane fabrication.24,25 The solvent
in the bath, called nonsolvent, differs from the solvent used (DMAc)
in the casting solution. During the immersion, the nonsolvent penetrates
into the polymer solution, separating it into a solid polymer phase
and a liquid solvent phase. The phase separation and the mixing of
the liquid solvent phase (DMAc) with the nonsolvent creates defined
porosity within the membrane. However, fast solvent exchange and rapid
phase separation result in a nonuniform pore-size distribution and
a dense skin layer.26−28 Therefore, an optimal combination of the casting
solution and the nonsolvent was necessary to obtain membranes with
high porosity and porous skin layers, which are extremely crucial
for solvent adsorption and a good ionic conductivity (see below).
Membranes casted from a 15 wt % solution of Na-SPEEK-63 and Na-SPEEK-93
in DMAc followed by subsequent immersion in 1-butanol displayed ideal
properties. Figure 1c shows an optical image of freestanding Na-SPEEK-63 membranes cut
into circular discs of 11 mm diameter. Interestingly, while the dense
membranes are optically transparent (Figure S2), the porous ones appear white as they scatter light. The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph in Figure 1c reveals the interconnected porous structure
of the membrane. Uniform and hierarchical nature of the porous structure
across the whole membrane thickness is further evident from Figures 1d and S5, which show the SEM micrographs of the cross
section. However, the true nature of the porosity was revealed by
Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) analysis as presented in Figure 1e (and Figure S6). A large fraction of pores are around
4–5 nm, which together with meso-/macro-pores of up to ∼80
nm in diameter result in relatively large cumulative surface areas
(∼35 m2 g–1). Interconnectivity
of these small pores with larger macropores (≥100–200
nm) creates a high surface area porous network that enhances the number
of −SO3–M+/2+ (M+/2+/Li+/Na+/K+/Zn2+/Mg2+) moieties in contact with the infused organic solvent,
increasing the number of metal ions contributing to the ion conduction
process. For simple geometric reason the large diameter pores (>100–200
nm) visible in the SEM micrographs contribute only nominally to the
overall surface area. However, these large pores are essential for
efficient solvent infusion and thus the enhancement of the ionic conductivity.
The interconnected porous structure throughout the whole membrane
enables an uptake of up to 76 wt % of the organic solvent mixture
EC–DEC (1:1 v/v). This is 25 times higher than the amount typically
adsorbed by the dense membrane (3 wt %), which displays a small surface
area of ∼7 m2 g–1. The pore-size
analysis of the dense membrane (Figure S6) reveals the presence of the same 4–5 nm mesopores, as observed
for the porous membranes, hinting that the small mesopores arise during
solvent evaporation. Yet, their population is rather low in the dense
membrane, and in the absence of large meso-/macro-pores, majority
of these most likely remain inaccessible for solvent infusion, resulting
in poor ionic conductivities (see below). Therefore, to ensure a highly
interconnected porous structure, the membrane preparation conditions
had to be optimized. Casting solutions with higher SPEEK contents
(20, and 25 wt %) and other nonsolvents resulted in less porous membranes
(Figures S7, S8, and Table S2), which highlights the influence of the casting solution
concentration and the properties of the nonsolvent on the porosity
of the membrane.

Interestingly, membranes obtained from other
M-SPEEK polymers (i.e.,
M = Li, K, Zn, and Mg) by the phase inversion method were less porous
than the Na-SPEEK ones. This is not surprising as the nature of the
counter cation in M-SPEEK strongly influences its interaction with
the solvent (DMAc) and the nonsolvent (butanol) and thus the phase
inversion kinetics and the porosity of the resultant ionomer membranes.
Therefore, freestanding porous M-SPEEK membranes for M = Li, K, Zn,
and Mg were directly obtained from Na-SPEEK membranes through ion
exchange in aqueous metal chloride solutions (2 M). Complete Na-ion
exchange and composition of the membranes were unequivocally confirmed
by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Table S3 and Figure S9) and quantitative
ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy)
analysis (Table S4). A complete ion exchange
is possible as the aqueous solution can spontaneously percolate into
the highly porous polymeric network, minimizing the ion diffusion
length to ∼0.5 μm, the dimension (macroscopic) of the
polymer filaments constituting the ionomer membrane. More importantly,
the Na-SPEEK membranes undergo mild swelling in aqueous solution as
a result of water infusion, which ensures a fast and complete ion
exchange in the bulk of the polymer. The ion-exchange process did
not disturb the interconnected porous structure (Figures S6 and S10), and as a result, the M-SPEEK membranes
(M = Li, K, Mg, and Zn) display nearly identical solvent (organic
carbonates) soaking behavior as the parent Na-SPEEK.

The mechanical
properties of the membranes were analyzed by mechanical
tensile testing. The Young’s modulus of a dry Na-SPEEK-63 membrane
is 322 ± 49 MPa, the tensile strength is 8.3 ± 0.7 MPa,
and the elongation at break is 18.0 ± 3.3%. Upon soaking in EC–DEC
(1:1 v/v), the mechanical strength weakens, as evident from the Young’s
modulus of 23 ± 6 MPa and the tensile strength of 1.1 ±
0.2 MPa. However, the elongation at break increases to 176.9 ±
21.2% because of higher ductility of the soaked membrane. Similar
results were obtained for Li/Zn-SPEEK membranes (Table S5). Notably, these values are significantly higher
than the mechanical properties of Nafion membranes.29,30 The thermal stability of SPEEK membranes were analyzed by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), as shown in Figure S11.
All of the M-SPEEK materials are thermally stable up to 450 °C
which is in good agreement with previously reported literature.19 Good thermal stability of the EC–DEC-soaked
ionomer membranes was confirmed by flame testing (Figure S12). While Celgard soaked in EC–DEC burn and
collapses in a second, the ionomer membrane is less readily combustible
and maintains its shape for longer.

Ionic Conductivity
The ionic conductivity of the M-SPEEK
(M = Na, Li, K, Mg, and Zn) membranes was measured in a symmetric
Swagelok-type cell with two stainless steel blocking electrodes. The
used membranes were all around 50 μm in thickness. The conductivity
was calculated by fitting the impedance data with an equivalent circuit,
shown in Figure 2a
(lower inset). Figure 2a shows the Nyquist impedance plot for a porous Na-SPEEK membrane
vis-à-vis a dense Na-SPEEK membrane (upper inset) infused with
EC–PC mixture (1:1 v/v). The dense membrane (Figure 2b) shows a very large semicircle,
which is the result of a very poor Na-ionic conductivity (2 ×
10–8 S cm–1). On the contrary,
the porous Na-SPEEK membrane (Figure 2d) infused with EC–PC shows nearly fourfold
higher Na-ion conductivity of 0.7 × 10–4 S
cm–1, which is comparable to high lithium ion conductivity
displayed by lithium exchanged Nafion upon PC infusion.9 It is well known that the rigid backbone in solid
polymer electrolytes does not allow local segmental motion,31,32 which is required for good ionic conductivity. One way to overcome
that is by plasticizing the polymer through organic solvent infiltration.
However, poor hydrophobicity of the PEEK backbone results in inadequate
aprotic solvent percolation, leading to limited dissociation and transport
of the sodium ions. In comparison, the hierarchically porous Na-SPEEK
membrane adsorbs relatively large amount of solvent (76 wt %). Furthermore,
the microstructure of the pore wall is expected to be decorated with
−SO3–Na+ clusters because
of the hydrogen bonding between sulfonate groups and 1-butanol during
the pore formation. These effects lead to facile dissociation of Na+ and their enhanced transport through the organic solvent-filled
nanochannels of the porous Na-SPEEK membrane. For high ionic conductivity,
the M-SPEEK membrane has to fulfill three main criteria. First, a
high surface area is needed to increase the number of −SO3–Na+ moieties in contact with
the organic solvent; second, a high DS to increase to total number
of charge carriers; and third, interconnected porous network and a
highly porous skin layer to ensure good infusion of the solvent and
wetting of the entire membrane (Table S6).

ionic conductivities of porous Na-SPEEK-93 membranes for EC–PC
(1:1 v/v), EC–DEC (1:1 v/v), and diglyme infusion.

Figure 2e compares
the ionic conductivity of two porous Na-SPEEK-93 membranes infused
with EC–DEC (1:1 v/v) in the temperature range 25–90
°C. The membrane with a porous skin layer (Figure 2d) has a Na-ion conductivity that is 2 orders
of magnitude higher than the Na-ion conductivity of a similarly porous
membrane but with a relatively dense skin layer (Figure 2c). A porous surface facilitates
wetting of the whole membrane, which leads to a higher ionic conductivity
as explained above. Influence of the DS on the ionic conductivity
is evident from Figure 2f, which compares the ionic conductivity of a Na-SPEEK-93 versus
a Na-SPEEK-63 membrane. As expected, higher DS results in a slightly
higher Na-ion conductivity because of an increase in the number of
charge carriers with increasing DS. Besides membrane properties, the
infused solvent was also found to have an influence on the ionic conductivity. Figure 2g displays the ionic
conductivities of Na-SPEEK-93 membranes infused with different organic
solvents. The membrane infused with EC–PC (1:1 v/v) shows the
highest Na+-ion conductivity followed by the one infused
with EC–DEC (1:1 v/v), whereas diglyme infusion leads to the
lowest conductivity. Clearly, the ionic conductivity increases with
increasing solvent polarity (dielectric constant) and decreasing viscosity
in the order, diglyme < EC–DEC < EC–PC because
higher solvent polarity promotes better cation dissociation and rapid
transport. However, EC–DEC (1:1 v/v) was chosen for further
studies, as the difference of ionic conductivities between the membranes
soaked in EC–DEC and EC–PC is not that high, and EC–DEC
is known to form more stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) than
EC–PC in lithium ion batteries.33,34

Recently,
there has been a huge surge in research activity on beyond
Li-ion batteries, for example, battery chemistries involving metal
ions like K+, Zn2+, and Mg2+.35−38 Thus, it was interesting to explore the ambitious but exciting prospect
of turning a Na+-conducting ionomer into Li+, K+, Zn2+, and Mg2+ ionomers. Figure 3a compares the ionic
conductivity of the corresponding ionomer membranes, soaked in EC–DEC
(v/v 1:1). All of the ionomer membranes had identical DS (DS = 63%),
similar pore distribution, and surface area (Figure S6). The monovalent ionomers, that is, Li-SPEEK, Na-SPEEK,
and K-SPEEK demonstrate higher ion conductivities than the divalent
ionomers Mg-SPEEK and Zn-SPEEK. Such behavior can be explained by
stronger solvation of the smaller (thus, high charge density) divalent
cations, which hinders fast ionic diffusion in the carbonate solvent.
To understand this effect further, the activation energies for the
ion mobility in the soaked membranes were calculated by fitting the
temperature-dependent ionic conductivity data with the modified Arrhenius
equation (eq 3, Methods) (Figure S13). As anticipated, the divalent ionomers Mg-SPEEK and Zn-SPEEK display
relatively higher activation energies (Ea) of 0.19 and 0.18 eV atom-1, respectively, compared with
Na-SPEEK (Ea = 0.12 eV atom-1) and Li-SPEEK (Ea = 0.13 eV atom-1). The solvation effect can also explain the ionic conductivity
trend among the monovalent ionomers where the ionic conductivity increases
from Li+ to Na+ to K+, in the order
of their respective size. The smaller size of the solvated K+ ion leads to faster diffusion and hence K-SPEEK shows the highest
room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.5 × 10–4 S cm-1 in EC–DEC, which increases to 1.2 ×
10–4 at 80 °C. This observation agrees well
with binary salt organic (liquid) electrolytes, where the K+ system displays the highest ionic conductivity.39,40 Interestingly, K-SPEEK exhibits an anomalous activation energy value
of 0.17 eV atom−1, which is higher than those of
Na-SPEEK and Li-SPEEK. This can be explained by increasing carrier
concentration (i.e., K+) in the electrolyte with increasing
temperature, which contributes an entropy term to the activation energy
determined from the slope of the Arrhenius plot (Figure S13). In simpler words, for the K-SPEEK ionomer membrane,
the entropy factor seems to have an influence on the activation process,
in addition to the commonly considered enthalpy.

v/v). (b) Ionic conductivities as a function of temperature for porous
Zn-SPEEK membranes soaked in EC–DEC and MQ water. The star
symbol in (b) designates the ionic conductivity of dense Zn-SPEEK
membrane infused with water.

Aqueous zinc batteries,
particularly those using near neutral aqueous
electrolytes have attracted tremendous attention in recent years.41 However, unrestricted nucleation and growth
of zinc from binary aqueous electrolytes can lead to similar dendritic
issues as with alkali metals in organic electrolytes.6,42,44Figure 3b shows the Zn2+-ion conductivity
of a Zn-SPEEK membrane infused with Milli-Q (MQ) water, which demonstrates
a very high conductivity of ∼10–2 S cm-1 at room temperature. This is only four times inferior to
1 M ZnSO4 in H2O (4 × 10–2 mS cm–1) and more than 3 orders of magnitude higher
than a Zn-SPEEK membrane infused with EC–DEC. Furthermore,
increasing the temperature had little influence on the ionic conductivity,
demonstrating facile dissociation of Zn-ions and their rapid transport
in water because of the high dielectric constant and low viscosity
of water. It is important to note that the dense Zn-SPEEK membrane
depicts 2 orders of magnitude lower ionic conductivity (Figure 3b) than the porous one, which
is explainable by only 32% water uptake by the dense membrane vis-à-vis
63% by the porous analogue. This observation further highlights the
crucial role of the hierarchical porous design in achieving a very
high metal ion conductivity.

Transference Number
To confirm the
single-ion conductivity
feature of the M-SPEEK membranes, the cation transference number was
determined by using the Bruce-Vincent method.43 Typically, a Na/Li/Zn-SPEEK membrane soaked in the desired solvent
(or solvent mixture) was sandwiched between two corresponding metal
foils and the current–time response was measured under a constant
dc bias potential of 20 mV. The measured initial current I0 reflects the movement of both cations and anions, while
the final steady-state current Iss results
exclusively from the motion of cations. By measuring the impedance
response of the symmetric cell before and after the polarization experiment,
the transference number tM+ (M+ = Na+, Li+, Zn2+) can be calculated from eq 4 (see Methods). Because alkali metals
are highly reactive to most organic solvents including EC–DEC,34,44,45 even without the applied polarization
the interfacial impedance was found to increase significantly with
time because of the formation of the passivating SEI. The impedance
corresponding to the ionic conductivity of the membrane, however,
stayed unchanged. Interestingly, SEI formation behavior of Na and
Li metal are very different.46 It is understood
that Na-SEIs have much lower ionic conductivities (Na+)
compared with Li-SEIs. This was true in our case as the interfacial
SEI impedance with Li-SPEEK was much smaller compared to the Na-SPEEK
cell, with EC−DEC as the solvent. A low ionic conductivity
within the SEI acts like a bottle-neck and leads to a higher overall
impedance for the whole cell. Consequently, it was not possible to
measure the Na+ transference number tNa+ at room temperature, and the measurements were
performed in an oven at 80 °C. Figure 4a shows the current response to the applied
polarization and the cell impedance before and after the polarization,
for a Na-SPEEK membrane soaked in EC–DEC (1:1 v/v) sandwiched
between two Na-metal electrodes. Although, the measurements were done
at 80 °C, the overall impedance because of the SEI still remains
quite high. The semicircle corresponds to the impedance of the Na-SEI
before and after the polarization measurement. The initial resistance
of 38 Ω, at the real axis intercept, corresponds to the ionic
conductivity of the Na-SPEEK membrane at 80 °C. On the basis
of these results, the transference number for the Na-SPEEK membrane
(tNa+) was calculated to be
0.92 (see Table S7). For better comparison,
the Li+ transference number (tLi+) was measured under the same conditions as tNa+. Figure 4b shows the current response to the applied
voltage polarization (20 mV) and the cell impedance before and after
the polarization. Unlike Na-SPEEK, two impedance semicircles appear
for the SEI with Li-SPEEK but the overall SEI impedance is about 40
times smaller than that for Na-SPEEK. The high-frequency resistance
of 27 Ω corresponds to the ionic conductivity of the Li-SPEEK
membrane at 80 °C. These results lead to a Li transference number
(tLi+) of 0.94 for the Li-SPEEK
in EC–DEC. Compared with Li- and Na-metal electrodes, SEI formation
is not an issue with zinc because of its relatively low electrochemical
potential. Therefore, the Zn2+ transference number measurement
could be carried out at room temperature. Figure 4c shows the current response to the voltage
polarization and the cell impedance before and after the polarization
for a Zn-SPEEK membrane soaked in MQ water. Although, SEI formation
is not an issue, the overall high impedance stems from a native ZnO
layer on the Zn electrodes.47 The transference
number for the Zn-SPEEK membrane (tZn2+) was calculated to be 0.89. As expected based on the chemistry
of the electrolyte system, all of the ionomer systems display very
high metal ion transference numbers, confirming their single-ion conductivity
characteristic in binary salt-free liquid solvents. The small deviations
from the unity value most likely reflect the retention of some mobile
anionic species in the membranes during the synthesis and fabrication
steps.

membrane at a current density of 200 μA cm–2; (f) Zn/Zn symmetric cell with MQ water-soaked Zn-SPEEK membrane.

Preliminary electrochemical studies
of reversible metal ion transport
through the ionomer membranes are presented in Figure 4d–f. Reversible Li plating/stripping
through an EC–DEC-soaked Li-SPEEK membrane is evident from Figure 4d. A current density
of 250 μA cm–2 was applied with a capacity
limitation of 0.5 mA h for plating/stripping. When employed as an
electrolyte in a full cell with a Li anode and LiFePO4 as
the positive host, stable charge–discharge cycling performance
was observed, delivering a steady capacity of 120 mA h g–1 at a 1 C rate (Figure S14). Because of
the very high impedance of the SEI layer for the EC–DEC with
Na metal (see above), feasibility of reversible Na+ cycling
through Na-SPEEK membrane was studied between two NaxTi2(PO4)3 (NTP; x = 1 and 3) electrodes. NTP has a relatively low electrochemical
potential and does not trigger the carbonate electrolyte decomposition
and thus SEI formation at the electrode interface, which allows the
reversible cycling of Na ions as shown in Figure 4e. A reversibly capacity of 0.15 mA h is
delivered at a current density of 200 μA cm–2 with unaltered voltage polarization over many cycles. Figure 4f shows the reversible voltage
response of a MQ-water-soaked Zn-SPEEK membrane under a current density
of 1 mA cm–2 for a zinc plating/stripping capacity
of 0.5 mA h. In the first few cycles, a decrease in overpotential
is observed, which most likely corresponds to the removal of the native
ZnO layer from the Zn electrodes.48 The
high current density of 1 mA cm–2 could be applied
because of the very high ionic conductivity of Zn-SPEEK soaked in
water (Figure 3b).
The Zn-SPEEK-H2O also displays excellent electrochemical
stability, exceeding 3 V (Figure S15a),
which is similar to the “water in salt” electrolyte
system.49 In comparison, EC–DEC-infused
Li-SPEEK demonstrates modest electrochemical stability in 0–5
V window versus Li (Figure S15b); however.
the effect of EC–DEC decomposition at lower potentials is also
apparent. It is important to note that the main goal of this study
is to demonstrate the development of versatile ionomer membranes based
on a simple and inexpensive polymer, not their optimization for alkali
metal battery applications.

Conclusion
Development
of hierarchically porous polymer membranes with versatile
ion conduction can be challenging. Here, we report on a template-free
synthesis of porous ionomer membranes from sulfonated PEEK through
a phase inversion method. An interconnected porous network along with
high surface area enables efficient solvent infusion, which is necessary
to promote facile cation dissociation and their rapid transport. Such
a membrane, made of a simple nonfluorinated polymer like SPEEK is
capable of versatile ion (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) conduction, resulting in
diverse ionomer membranes. While alkali-SPEEK membranes infused with
liquid organic carbonates reach ionic conductivities up to ∼10–4 S cm–1 at room temperature, Zn-SPEEK
infused with water displays an unprecedented ionic conductivity of
∼10–2 S cm–1. The former
value is comparable to that of Li-Nafion membranes infused with PC,
and the latter one marginally falls short of the conductivity of 1
M ZnSO4 in water. These conductivity values are several
orders of magnitude higher than those for the dense SPEEK membranes.
Although several high conductivity Li ionomers have been reported
to date, Na and K ionomers with good ionic conductivities are rare,
and dicationic ionomeres with our reported conductivities are nonexistent.
Besides, all ionomers display near unity metal ion transference numbers,
and feasibility of reversible metal ion cycling through the ionomer
membranes is demonstrated. Overall, the presented findings have the
prospect to inspire a new avenue of ionomer membrane development with
high single-metal ion conductivity from simple and inexpensive polymers.

Methods
Synthesis of SPEEK
Details regarding the synthesis
of SPEEK and its characterization by NMR can be found in the Supporting Information.

Membrane Fabrication
A 15 wt % solution of Na-SPEEK
in DMAc was casted onto a glass plate via doctor blading with a casting
speed of 15 mm s–1 and a casting gap of 50–200
μm. The casted film was immediately immersed into a bath of
butanol for 20 min. The resulting porous Na-SPEEK membrane was carefully
detached from the glass plate, dried at 200 °C under vacuum for
12 h, and directly transferred to an argon filled glove box. Typically,
membranes of thickness between 20 and 100 μm were obtained depending
on the casting gap, but 50 μm thick membranes were applied in
all studies. The dried membranes were punched into circular disks
(11 mm in diameter). Prior to use, the membrane disks were immersed
in the respective solvent/solvent mixtures for at least 12 h. SPEEK
membranes with Li+, K+, Zn2+, and
Mg2+ as the counter cation, referred to as Li-SPEEK, K-SPEEK,
Zn-SPEEK, and Mg-SPEEK were obtained by immersing Na-SPEEK membranes
in a 2 M aqueous LiCl, KCl, MgCl2, or ZnCl2 solution,
respectively, for 12 h before profusely washing with MQ water.

Membrane
Characterization
The DS, which is defined
as the ratio of sulfonated to nonsulfonated PEEK units, was determined
by elemental microanalysis according to 1  where MC and MS are the atomic weight of carbon and sulfur,
respectively. The weight fraction of carbon mC and sulfur mS was obtained by
elemental microanalysis. By calculating the ratio of sulfur atoms
per PEEK unit (one PEEK unit is equal to 19 carbon atoms), the DS
was obtained. SEM was performed with a LEO Gemini 1530. TGA was performed
in air on a TGA/SDTA 851 from METTLER TOLEDO by applying a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1 in the temperature range
25–1100 °C. Mechanical tensile testing of dry and wet
membranes was performed on a Shimadzu (Autograph AGS-X). The membranes
were cut into dog-bone-shaped specimens and then pulled apart under
ambient conditions. Stress–strain curves were obtained at a
crosshead speed of 2 mm min–1 and an initial load
of 0.02 N using Trapezium X software. The surface area was determined
by the BET analysis of the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm
recorded at 77 K on a Quantachrome AUTOSORB-iQ. Density functional
theory (DFT) analysis was applied on the adsorption branch of the
isotherm to determine the pore-size distribution and pore volume.50 The solvent uptake of the membranes was measured
by immersing them in an EC–DEC (1:1 v/v) solution for 12 h.
The solvent uptake SU (wt %) was calculated according to 2  where mwet and mdry are
the weight of the wet and dry membrane,
respectively.

Ionic Conductivity
The soaked (12
h) ionomer membrane
was mounted in a symmetric Swagelok-type cell, sandwiched between
two stainless steel rods. The resistance of the membrane was measured
using a two probe ac impedance spectroscopy (VMP3, Biologic) in the
frequency range from 400 kHz to 100 mHz with a potentiostatic signal
perturbation of 10 mV. The ionic conductivities at different temperatures
were obtained by fitting the Nyquist plot using EC-lab Z-fit analysis
software. The activation energy for Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, and Zn-ion
diffusion was obtained by linear fitting of the ionic conductivity
values applying the modified Arrhenius equation 3  where σ is the temperature-dependent
ionic conductivity, σ0 is the ionic conductivity
at absolute zero temperature, Ea is the
activation energy of ion diffusion, kb is Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Transference Number
According to the method of Evans
et al. using eq 4, the
ion transference number t+ was calculated.43 4  where I0 and Iss are the currents in the unpolarized and polarized
states, respectively, R0 and Rss are the resistances in the unpolarized and polarized
states, respectively, and ΔV is the potential
step used in the method. The ionomer membranes Na-SPEEK-93 and Li-SPEEK-63
soaked in EC–DEC (1:1 v/v) and Zn-SPEEK-93 soaked in MQ-water
were mounted in a symmetric Swagelok-type cell, sandwiched between
two Na, Li, or Zn disks, respectively. The dc polarization experiments
(using VMP3, Biologic) were conducted at an applied voltage of 20
mV for 2 h, and the impedance spectroscopy data were recorded before
and after the polarization in the frequency range of 400 kHz to 100
mHz with a perturbation of 10 mV.

Electrochemical Studies
Na-SPEEK-93 and Li-SPEEK-63
soaked in EC–DEC (1:1 v/v) and Zn-SPEEK-93 soaked in MQ-water
were used. The electrochemical measurements were performed using a
VMP3 (Biologic) cycler. Zn stripping and plating performance was tested
at a fixed current density of ±1 mA cm–2 for
a capacity of 0.5 mA h. Li stripping and plating performance was tested
at a fixed current density of ±250 μA cm–2 and a capacity of 0.5 mA h. Na cycling was carried out between two
NaxTi2(PO4)3 (NTP; x = 1 and 3) electrodes at a fixed
current density of ±200 μA cm–2 in a
potential limit of ±1 V for a capacity of 0.15 mA h. Carbon-coated
NaTi2(PO4)3 was synthesized by following
a literature report,51 while its electrochemical
Na+ intercalation resulted in the Na3Ti(PO4)3. For the Li–LiFePO4 cell,
a commercial LiFePO4 from MTI Corp (USA) was used. The
LiFePO4 was mixed with carbon and Li-SPEEK in 70:15:15
weight ratio in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to obtain
a viscous slurry, which was casted on a carbon-coated Al foil and
dried at 100 °C under vacuum to obtain the cathode. A 50 μm
Li-SPEEK membrane soaked in EC–DEC (1:1 v/v) was placed between
a Li anode foil and a 0.785 cm2 cathode coin (soaked in
EC–DEC solvent) to assemble the full cell. The cell was galvanostatically
charged–discharged by applying a current density of 170 mA
g–1 (1 C: 1 h charge/discharge).
