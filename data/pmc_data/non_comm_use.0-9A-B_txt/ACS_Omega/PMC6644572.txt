In this paper, we
study the interaction of a small dye molecule,
namely, methylene blue (MB) with graphene surfaces using surface plasmon
resonance (SPR). We show that by utilizing all of the parameters of
the SPR angular dip and exploiting the fact that MB absorbs light
at the operating wavelength, it is possible to detect the binding
of small molecules that would otherwise not give a significant signal.
The binding of MB to unmodified graphene is found to be stronger than
that for gold. By studying the interaction at modified surfaces, we
demonstrate that electrostatic effects play a dominant role in the
binding of MB on to graphene. Furthermore, following the binding kinetics
at various concentrations allows us to estimate apparent equilibrium
binding and rate constants for the interaction of MB with graphene.

1 Introduction
The interaction of dyes, such as methylene blue (MB), with carbon-based
materials has been a matter of widespread interest due to the redox
properties of MB1 and broad applicability
in electrochemical (bio)sensors.2−5 MB intercalates with double-stranded DNA, and the
electroactivity of MB has been exploited in nucleic acid sensors.6,7 Moreover, composites made of MB and graphene oxide are promising
for active components of immunosensors.2 Methylene blue was found to bind strongly with carbon nanotubes
and reduced graphene oxide, and the interactions were noncovalent
in nature attributed to electrostatic and π–π interactions.8−10 A recent study, involving the interaction of another dye rhodamine
6G with graphene oxide, found that the dye may covalently attach to
defect sites on graphene oxide derivatives.11 There is little systematic information yet on the interaction of
MB with monolayer graphene (e.g., using exfoliation or chemical vapor
deposition (CVD)). In contrast to graphene oxide-based materials,
CVD-graphene12 is rather free of ionizable
groups, which might have a considerable effect on the nature and mechanism
of binding. Moreover, the kinetics of binding was not investigated
in the previous studies.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is
ideally suited for studying
the interaction of molecules on surfaces since the involved binding
partners can be studied in their native forms without the need for
labeling or complex protocols.13−18 Moreover, the kinetics of binding can be followed in real time.
Typically, a gold surface with immobilized ligands is used for this
purpose. Here, we deposit a graphene monolayer on the gold surface
to study the interaction of the dye directly with graphene. To be
able to detect the binding of analyte molecules on the SPR sensor
surface, in the simplest case, the analyte should induce a sufficient
change in the local dielectric constant at the interface.19,20 Although this is easily observed when using large biomolecules,
it is a challenge to detect very low amount of small analytes binding
to the sensor surface. The minimal changes in dielectric constant
set a limitation on the sensitivity for the detection of low molecular
weight (LMW) molecules (molecular weight < 300 Da, such as MB).21 Understanding the interaction of LMW compounds
is crucial in the design of new pharmaceuticals.22 LMWs that absorb light in the wavelength used for SPR measurements
allow a more sensitive detection.21 Indeed,
the ability of graphene to absorb light at visible wavelengths has
motivated a series of theoretical23 and
experimental12,24−28 investigations on using graphene on gold as a sensor
surface when using SPR. For the detection of analytes with receptors
immobilized on the graphene surface, graphene offers some key advantages.
First of all, the adsorption of biomolecules increases as a result
of high surface-to-volume ratio and π–π stacking
interactions between graphene and receptor molecules.26,27,29,30 Second, it has been proposed that a single sheet of graphene may
enhance the SPR response due to its unique electronic and optical
properties.12 Related to this concept are
experiments where dyes have been tested as a label to enhance the
SPR response.21,31 In SPR studies reported until
now, graphene was used only to facilitate the binding or improve the
quality of SPR signal. In contrast, here we focus on the direct interaction
of a LMW molecule (MB) with an unmodified monolayer graphene surface.

2 Results and Discussion
To study the interaction of
methylene blue with CVD-graphene using
SPR, we have devised a modified procedure to transfer graphene on
to a gold surface. The gold-coated glass slides are initially functionalized
with carboxyl groups to render the surface hydrophilic. This ensures
a conformal transfer of CVD-graphene with minimal wrinkles and breakoff.
The details of functionalization and the transfer process are presented
in the Experimental Section. Figure 1a shows an optical image of
the SPR chip with transferred graphene, whereas Figure 1b shows SPR angular spectra obtained in air
at various stages during the transfer process. It can be seen that
the SPR angular dip shifts to higher angles after surface modification
and after graphene transfer, attesting the formation of a functional
layer and the presence of graphene, respectively, as has been reported
in previous works.24,32 SPR angular spectra were also
acquired in water and in buffer before and after transfer of graphene.
These results are discussed in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).

Figure 1 (a) Optical image of graphene on a gold-coated
glass slide. (b)
SPR angular spectra of bare gold (Au), carboxylated gold (Au*), and
graphene on Au* (Au*Gr) measured in air. The inset shows a zoomed-in
region of the spectrum around the SPR dip.

Figure 2a
presents
partial SPR angular spectra in acetate buffer (pH 4.2) for the interaction
of 1 μM methylene blue with graphene transferred on to the modified
gold surface (the complete spectra can be found in Figure S2). It is apparent from Figure 2a that in the presence of methylene blue
the angular dip is offset slightly to lower angles. In addition, the
entire curve shifts upward with an increase in intensity at the minimum
angle. Figure 2b shows
spectra obtained on the carboxylated gold surface (in the absence
of graphene) for the same interaction. In this case, the shift in
the minimum angle and the intensity change at the dip are rather negligible.
The absence of complete recovery in Figure 2a suggests that MB binds to the graphene
surface during the interaction. Furthermore, the negligible shift
in Figure 2b indicates
that the interaction of MB with graphene is likely much stronger than
the interaction with the gold surface.

Figure 2 SPR angular spectra measured
with and without methylene blue (MB)
in acetate buffer (pH 4.2): (a) graphene on carboxylated gold surface
(Au*Gr) (b) carboxylated gold surface (Au*). Measurements were taken
initially after 25 min of baseline in buffer (t =
25), after subsequent association for 15 min in the presence of MB
(t = 40), and finally after 20 min dissociation time
in buffer (t = 60). MB concentration is 1 μM.
Flow rate: 130 ± 5 μL/min.

Typically, SPR investigations focus on the changes in the
position
of angular dip to investigate binding kinetics. However, an SPR angular
spectrum contains more information than just the minimum angle. Specifically,
the spectrum around the minimum angle can be approximated by a parabola
and can be expressed as I(θ) = I0 + w(θ – θmin)2, where I is the measured intensity
as a function of the angle θ, I0 is the intensity at the minimum angle θmin, and w the width of the parabola.21,33 Shifts in
minimum angle θmin are indicative mainly of changes
in the real part of dielectric constant at the sensor-medium interface,
whereas the width w and intensity I0 provide additional information about the imaginary part
of the dielectric constant, for example, if the adsorbed material
absorbs light.33Figure 3 presents kinetic data in the form of SPR
sensorgrams, where the position of the angular dip θmin as well as the intensity at minimum angle I0 and the width w are recorded simultaneously
as a function of time during the interaction of MB with the gold surface
in the presence and absence of graphene. For graphene (black curve),
the θmin (Figure 3a) and I0 (Figure 3b) channels show clear changes
during the association and dissociation phases. However, for the case
of gold in the absence of graphene (red curve) a significant response
is only observed in the intensity (I0)
channel. The width channel (Figure 3c) does not show sizeable changes for both cases. The
higher sensitivity of the I0 channel can
be understood by considering that the adsorbed MB absorbs light at
the laser wavelength (λexc = 633.2 nm) causing a
shift in I0 toward higher values during
the association phase. The change in the real part of the dielectric
constant of bound MB is, on the other hand, not high enough to observe
shifts in the θmin channel. Shifts in the intensity
of the plasmon resonance dip have been observed in wavelength scanning
mode earlier on absorptive films.5

evolution of the relative changes in three SPR parameters: (a) angular
dip θmin, (b) intensity I0, and (c) width w on carboxylated gold surface without
(red line) and with graphene (black line). For each measurement, the
association time with MB was 15 min and the dissociation in acetate
buffer was 20 min. The baseline in acetate buffer was measured for
25 min prior to the start of association. Flow rate: 130 ± 5
μL/min.

To gather further support
that we are mainly observing bound MB
and not effects due to changes in the background medium (e.g., due
to MB in solution), we have characterized the samples using UV–vis
spectroscopy before and after the association phase. After association,
the sample is gently rinsed in water before the measurement. Figure 4a presents the absorption
spectra (measured in air) for graphene on quartz before and after
incubation with MB. The absorption spectrum of bare graphene (black
curve) shows a clear Fano resonance at shorter wavelengths and a rather
flat absorption close to the theoretical value of πα (∼2.3%)
at higher wavelengths in accordance with previous observations.34 After incubation with MB, there is a slight
overall increase in absorption and the occurrence of an additional
band at around 650 nm (red curve). The absorption spectrum can be
further improved by using another graphene on quartz sample, as a
reference. In this case, we can directly obtain the absorption only
due to the adsorbed MB layer on graphene. Such a spectrum is shown
in Figure 4b (black
line), together with the absorption spectrum of 1 μM MB in solution
(red line). It is apparent that both the absorption bands (around
290 and 650 nm) characteristic of MB are clearly discernible on the
graphene sample confirming that MB indeed adsorbs strongly on to the
graphene surface. Moreover, it is clear from these spectra that there
is a sizeable absorption of light at the SPR laser wavelength (λexc = 633.2 nm) explaining the changes in the intensity at
minimum (I0), as discussed earlier. In
comparison to free MB in solution, the bound MB shows a broader absorption
band around 630 nm, which may be due to aggregation of several molecular
layers of MB on the graphene surface.35

Figure 4 (a)
Absorption spectrum of graphene on quartz (black line) and
graphene with bound MB (red line), using a quartz slide as blank.
(b) Red curve: absorption spectrum of 1 μM MB in acetate buffer
(blank: acetate buffer); black curve: absorption spectrum of bound
MB on graphene/quartz, with graphene/quartz used as blank. In this
case, the absorption is only due to the MB layer on graphene.

The downward shift of minimum
angle θmin upon
MB binding (Figure 3a) is consistent with thicker layers of MB depicting a lower dielectric
constant (real part) for wavelengths below 665 nm.5 Another possibility is that the bound MB introduces some
kind of charge transfer on to graphene, which may modify the optical
properties of graphene. However, in this case typically an upward
shift of the angular dip has been reported.11 Hence, we believe that the dominant factor causing the observed
changes is due to the absorptive nature of the bound MB layer. In
contrast to the case of rhodamine 6G,11 we do not have any indication of covalent bonding, which is confirmed
by Raman spectroscopy (Figure S3, Supporting
Information) and due to the fact that we can recover the free graphene
surface after flushing with buffer. On the basis of these considerations,
we conclude that methylene blue binds (noncovalently) to graphene
through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions similar to interactions
between DNA and MB.36

To assess the
nature of these interactions further, we have investigated
the effect of the concentration of MB on the SPR response on gold
surfaces with and without graphene. The I0 sensorgrams for the interaction of MB at various concentrations
are depicted in Figure 5 for both surfaces. On gold surfaces, it is difficult to see a significant
response below 1 μM. However, on the graphene surface a clear
response is observable down to 10 nM. This is also apparent from the
equilibrium plots shown in Figure 6, where it is clear that it is possible to detect MB
at concentrations much lower than that on gold. From such plots, we
have extracted an apparent equilibrium binding constant (KD) for the interaction of MB with the surface by assuming
a 1:1 site binding model.37 For the sample
in Figure 6, we obtain KD values of 772 ± 303 nM for MB–graphene
binding and 4.61 ± 2.21 μM for MB–gold binding.
Similar values were observed on other samples (statistics of responses
on other samples are shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information). In addition to single-step method, kinetic
data can also be obtained using the kinetic titration method,38 which avoids the need for regenerating the surface
for every concentration step and allows the recording of kinetic data
in a much shorter time interval. An example of such a dataset is shown
in Figure 7, depicting
a similar response as for the single-step method. From such datasets,
we have estimated the kinetic rate constants by performing a global
fit using the 1:1 site binding model. The kinetic parameters for the
data in Figure 7 are
as follows: ka = 3.48 ± 0.2 ×
103 M–1s–1 (association
rate constant) and kd = 2.25 ± 0.25
× 10–3 s–1 (dissociation
rate constant). The modeled kinetic binding curve using these parameters
is shown as the red curve in Figure 7.

changes
in I0 for MB concentrations from 0.01
to 10 μM on a modified gold surface with ((a) Au*Gr) and without
((b) Au*) graphene. After each measurement, 0.2 M HCl was injected
for 15 min to regenerate the surface for the next concentration. See Figure S4 for the time evolution of θmin and w.

change in I0 at t = 8
min as a function of concentration for the data in Figure 5: (a) graphene on carboxylated
gold, (b) carboxylated gold. The red lines are curves obtained by
fitting a 1:1 binding model to the data, allowing us to estimate an
apparent equilibrium binding constant KD.

of MB with graphene,
where the surface is exposed to increasing concentrations of MB without
regenerating the surface. The black arrows indicate the injection
of MB at the concentration indicated, while the gray arrows indicate
the transition to buffer. The red line is a fitting curve obtained
by using 1:1 binding model, used to extract the kinetic parameters.

A higher KD for graphene suggests that
the binding of MB on to the graphene surface is stronger than the
carboxyl-terminated gold surface. It is worth mentioning that the
binding is weak also on an unmodified gold surface (i.e., without
carboxylation). These data are shown in Figures S6 and S7 (Supporting Information). At a pH of 4.2, the carboxylated
gold surface is rather neutral (pKa of
propionic acid is around 4.9) and hydrophilic, whereas the unmodified
gold surface is hydrophobic and devoid of a significant charge density.
In contrast, monolayer graphene on SiO2 was found to exhibit
an isoelectric point less than 3.3, rendering the surface negative
at all pH values greater than 3.3.39 It
is possible that graphene on gold also exhibits a significant negative
charge density, which induces strong electrostatic interactions with
the positively charged MB ions, explaining the stronger binding on
graphene. To evaluate this hypothesis systematically, we have performed
two separate sets of measurements. In a first set, we modify the surface
of graphene with aromatic amino groups by electropolymerization of
4-aminobenzylamine (ABA). This renders the surface positively charged
at pH 4.2 (as we have shown earlier),39 while maintaining a similar level of hydrophobicity as the bare
graphene surface. Figure 8a shows the kinetic response after modification of the graphene
surface with 1 mM ABA, where it is apparent that the response is weaker
than that of graphene. The density of the amino groups on the surface
can be increased by using a higher concentration of the precursor
during electropolymerization. By increasing the density of positive
charges (with 10 mM ABA concentration), we observe that the response
is even lower, as shown in Figure 8b. Figure 8c shows the equilibrium responses for these two cases together
with that of bare graphene. It is clear that the binding of the cationic
MB to the positively charged surface is significantly hampered in
comparison to the bare graphene surface, as exemplified by the higher
binding constant values for these two cases. In a second set of experiments,
we evaluated the role played by hydrophobic interactions. For this
purpose, we render the gold surface hydrophobic by functionalizing
the surface with a long chain alkanethiol, namely, dodecylmercaptan
(DM). Also for this case, the binding of MB on to the surface is considerably
weaker, as is apparent from the kinetic response and the equilibrium
plot shown in Figure 9. On the basis of these two observations, we conclude that electrostatic
interactions between the cationic MB and the negatively charged graphene
surface predominantly dictate the binding kinetics of MB on to graphene
at the micromolar concentrations investigated here.

Figure 8 Concentration-dependent
kinetic response of relative changes in I0 for the interaction of MB with Au*Gr (in buffer,
pH 4.2) electrochemically modified with (a) 1 mM ABA and (b) 10 mM
ABA (ABA: 4-aminobenzylamine). The association and dissociation times
are the same as in Figure 5. (c) Equilibrium curves for the binding of MB to unmodified
Gr (black line) and graphene modified with 1 mM ABA (red line), 10
mM ABA (blue line). As the density of positive charges on the graphene
surface increases (with ABA modification), the KD values are found to increase.

Figure 9 (a) Concentration-dependent kinetic response of relative changes
in I0 for the interaction of MB with a
gold surface modified with dodecylmercaptan (AuDM). This modification
makes the gold surface highly hydrophobic. (b) Equilibrium curves
for the modified surface AuDM (black line) in comparison to the graphene
surface Au*Gr (red line). With a hydrophobic surface, such as AuDM, KD is found to increase.

To demonstrate the applicability of our technique, we have
also
investigated the interaction of three other small molecules with the
graphene surface. All these three molecules have a sizeable extinction
coefficient at the SPR laser wavelength. A summary of these observations
is shown in Figure 10. With nile blue A (Figure 10a), which has a chemical structure close to that of MB, a
similar binding behavior in the same concentration range like that
for MB is observed. This is consistent with our finding that electrostatic
interactions play a dominant role, since nile blue A is completely
dissociated and is found as a cation in solution (similar to MB). Figure 10b shows the kinetic
response for the interaction of a neutral compound calmagite with
the graphene surface. In this case, we observe that there is no binding
observable up to a concentration of 10 μM, which further confirms
the role played by electrostatic interactions. Finally, Figure 10c presents data
obtained for the interaction of a rather hydrophobic species perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride (PTCDA) with graphene, where we do not see any response
even up to 100 μM. PTCDA has often been used in studies for
deposition from the vapor phase in ultrahigh vacuum and was observed
to form self-assembled layers on epitaxial graphene through π–π
stacking.40,41 We do not see such an interaction in solution,
indicating that π–π stacking probably plays a less
important role under the aqueous conditions experimented here. These
examples demonstrate that the method (multiparameter absorptive SPR)
is applicable for studying the interaction of a range of LMW species
on nanostructures, with the only requirement that the analyte molecule
must have a sizeable extinction at the SPR wavelength used.

dianhydride (PTCDA) on Au*Gr. After each measurement, 0.2 M HCl was
injected for 15 min to regenerate the surface for the next concentration.
The association and dissociation times are the same as in Figure 5.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have quantified the interaction of a small molecule,
namely, methylene blue with CVD-graphene using multiparameter SPR.
By exploiting the optical absorption of the dye at the working wavelength,
we observe that MB binds strongly to the graphene surface without
forming a covalent bond, as exemplified from equilibrium SPR measurements
and spectroscopy. The binding of the dye occurs at a much lower concentration
on graphene than that on gold. We attribute the larger affinity of
MB to graphene to predominant electrostatic effects corroborated by
experiments using modified surfaces. MB is a widely used redox couple
and hence the strong interaction of this dye with graphene will have
important consequences in electrochemistry and electroanalysis. On
the other hand, our results demonstrate that multiparameter SPR can
be efficiently used to study interactions not only on absorbing surfaces,
such as graphene, but also involving analyte molecules that absorb
at the measurement wavelength.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Graphene Transfer on to Gold-Coated Glass
Slides
First, the gold surface was carboxylated to reduce
the hydrophobicity of the surface. For this purpose, gold-coated glass
slides were incubated overnight in 3-mercaptopropionic acid in ethanol.
Then, the samples were washed with ethanol three times for 20 s and
dried with N2 gas. After modification, the samples were
cleaned with acetone and isopropanol. CVD-graphene (Graphenea) was
cut into square pieces (typically 1 cm × 1 cm), and a solution
of polystyrene (PS) (50 mg/mL in toluene) was spotted over the copper
foil (PS/graphene/copper/graphene) and dried at 75 °C for 15
min. After the deposition of PS, the underlying copper was removed
by etching in a solution of hydrochloric acid with added hydrogen
peroxide (15% v/v 37% HCl + 5% v/v 30% H2O2).
Then, graphene was transferred to modified gold samples and baked
in the oven at 75 °C for 15 min before removal of PS using toluene.
To modify the graphene surface, we use electropolymerization of a
precursor, namely, 4-aminobenzylamine (ABA), whose preparation details
have been reported earlier.39 Hydrophobic
gold surfaces are prepared by incubating the glass chip (coated with
gold) overnight in a 1 M solution of dodecylmercaptan in ethanol.

4.2 Preparation of Methylene Blue Solutions
Solutions of methylene blue (MB), from 0.01 to 10 μM, were
prepared in acetate buffer solution (10 mM, pH = 4.2, with 0.1 M KCl)
freshly before each measurement.

4.3 Binding
Assay
Equilibrium measurements
were performed at room temperature using the classical single-step
method.42 Kinetic data were collected using
either the single-step method or using kinetic titration.38 In the classical single-step method, the association
time for MB interaction with graphene was 15 min (tassoc) after obtaining a baseline. The bound MB was let
to dissociate for 20 min (tdissoc) in
the blank buffer. HCl (200 mM) was used to regenerate the surface
for 10 min. In most concentrations, the equilibrium was attained within
15 min. In the kinetic titration method, the lowest concentration
of MB was injected for 15 min (tassoc)
followed by dissociation for 15 min (tdissoc). Without regeneration, this association–dissociation cycle
was repeated for the remaining concentrations. The equilibrium data
were fitted using a self-written Mathematica program using the Nonlinearmodelfit
routine with the NMinimize method.

4.4 SPR Instrumentation
SPR measurements
were performed using a RT2005 spectrometer from RES-TEC GmbH. The
instrument operates in Kretschmann configuration using a HeNe laser
(λexc: 632.8 nm) in angle scanning mode. The samples
are glass slides (N-BK7, n = 1.515) coated with 48
nm gold and a 2 nm chromium adhesion layer. The liquid is delivered
on to the chip surface using a flow channel controlled by a Fluigent
8-channel Microfluidics Flow Control System. All of the measurements
were performed at a pressure of 50 mbar, which corresponds to a flow
rate of 130 ± 5 μL/min.

4.5 Spectroscopy
Absorbance measurements
were performed using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950/1050 spectrometer. A
big graphene piece (2 cm × 1 cm) was transferred on to quartz
substrate using the wet transfer method. Then, the graphene sample
was placed in MB solution in acetate buffer, for 15 min, followed
by rinsing in water and drying. For the thin films on quartz substrate,
the PE-Labsphere accessory (150 mm Spectralon) was used to measure
the transmittance (T%) and reflectance (R%). The absorbance (A) was calculated using the
formula: A = (100 – T% – R%)/100. Auto zero was done with respect to quartz for Figure 4a, with respect to
graphene on quartz for Figure 4b. Raman spectra were obtained on a JASCO NRS-4100 Raman spectrometer
equipped with a 1024 × 256 charge-coupled device detector (Andor;
air/Peltier cooled, operating temperature: −60 °C), a
400 1/mm grating, a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG diode-pumped solid state
laser with an excitation of 532 nm, and a 100× (NA 0.90) objective
and a power of 5.6 mW. The Raman spectra were recorded and processed
using Spectra Manager and Origin 9.1.
