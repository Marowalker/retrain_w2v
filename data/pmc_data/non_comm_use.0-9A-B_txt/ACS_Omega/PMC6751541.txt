Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared
using solid-state ion exchange
(SSIE) and liquid ion exchange (LIE). SSIE is conducted by calcining
a physical mixture of H-SAPO-34 zeolite and CuO nanoparticles at elevated
temperatures (500–800 °C). The conventional LIE method
is conducted by exchanging Na-SAPO-34 with Cu(COOCH3)2 aqueous solution with a final calcination step at 500 °C.
Catalysts were fully characterized, focusing on Cu species identification.
The NH3-SCR activity is evaluated for NOx removal. Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts synthesized by SSIE at 700
°C achieved an optimal reaction rate, which was correlated with
a higher proportion of Cu2+ ions. The activation energies
of Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts prepared by SSIE and LIE with varying copper
loadings are 32–38 and 42–47 kJ mol–1, respectively. The SSIE catalysts achieve higher turnover frequency
than LIE catalysts for a similar copper content, which decreases on
increasing the copper loading. These results provide evidence that
Cu ions exchanged into the Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts synthesized by SSIE
present higher activity than those prepared by LIE for NOx removal by NH3-SCR.

1 Introduction
In
the last decades, diesel and lean-burn gasoline engines are
attracting more and more attention as they provide better fuel economy
and produce lower CO2 emissions compared with conventional
stoichiometric gasoline engines. However, the cleanup of diesel and
lean-burn gasoline engine exhaust is more challenging, specifically
regarding NOx removal, due to the distinctly
oxidant environment. Under these operating conditions, three-way catalyst
are not efficient, and alternative catalytic strategies must be implemented
to fulfill stringent emission standards. NOx storage and reduction,1 also denominated
lean NOx trap, and selective catalytic
reduction (SCR)2 are the preferred technologies
to mitigate NOx emission.

Selective
catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3-SCR) is widely implemented for
NOx removal from heavy-duty diesel vehicles3 and more recently has also been implemented for
passenger cars.4 NH3-SCR operation
requires a constant feeding of NH3 to stoichiometrically
reduce NOx, running the operation at steady
state. NH3 is generated from the decomposition of urea
solution injected into the exhaust gas upstream of the SCR catalyst.5 There are three main reactions leading to NOx reduction through NH3-SCR: (i) standard
SCR (4NH3 + 4NO + O2 → 4N2 + 6H2O), (ii) fast SCR (2NH3 + NO + NO2 → 2N2 + 3H2O), and (iii) NO2 SCR (4NH3 + 3NO2 → 3.5N2 + 6H2O).6,7

Zeolite-based
catalysts have been proposed as the most promising
catalyst formulation for mobile applications, more specifically, iron-
or copper-ion-exchanged zeolites.8 Among
zeolite-based materials, MFI, BEA, and CHA frameworks have been successfully
used for NH3-SCR. These types of zeolite frameworks differ
in their pore size, i.e., the opening diameters are around 6, 5, and
4 Å for BEA, MFI, and CHA, respectively. In recent years, copper-exchanged
SSZ-13 and SAPO-34 zeolites, both with a CHA framework, have been
commercially applied in diesel after-treatment systems due to their
higher low-temperature activity and hydrothermal stability.9

The conventional method to introduce copper
into zeolites is liquid
ion exchange (LIE). Copper ions (Cu2+ or Cu+) can replace cations (NH4+, Na+, H+, etc.) that are compensating the charge defect introduced
by Al atoms replacing Si atoms in the zeolite framework. Thus, the
Si/Al ratio governs the ion-exchange capacity of aluminosilicates
(e.g., SSZ-13); the more the aluminum content, the more the ability
to accommodate Cu ions. However, the previous statement does not apply
for aluminosilicophosphates (e.g., SAPO-34) because it depends on
where Si is replacing Al or P. In fact, silicon tends to accommodate
in the framework forming patches or islands (Si–O–Si),10 and thus, only silicon ions in the border of
the island would create a charge defect to be compensated by cations,
limiting the exchange capacity of SAPO-34. Furthermore, the narrow
opening diameter of 0.38 nm further impedes the introduction of copper
by LIE.

An alternative method to introduce copper ions into
zeolites is
by solid-state ion exchange (SSIE). The SSIE method relies on heating
a physical mixture of the zeolite and a copper precursor to temperatures
near 800 °C.11,12 This process is reported to be
driven by the release of water upon exchange with protons in the zeolite.13,14 In the present study, SAPO-34 zeolite will be used as zeolite support
due to its higher hydrothermal stability with respect to SSZ-13.15

The objective of the present paper is
to advance the understanding
of the formation of different copper species in the SSIE and LIE preparation
methods and their roles in NOx removal
from diesel exhaust gases by ammonia selective catalytic reduction
(NH3-SCR). Different Cu species are deeply characterized
with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electronic paramagnetic resonance
(EPR), temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and desorption
(NH3-TPD), and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy
(UV–vis), specifically focusing on differences between SSIE
and LIE preparation methodologies. Furthermore, the comparison of
both preparation methodologies is extended to examine the copper loading
effect, the nature and location of Cu in the SAPO-34 framework, turnover
frequency (TOF) determination, and calculation of activation energies.
The superior activity of SSIE with respect to LIE is specifically
demonstrated in the present work that, to our knowledge, could not
be concluded from papers previously reported in the scientific literature.

2 Conclusions
Increasing the temperature at which solid-state
ion exchange (SSIE)
is carried out from 500 up to 700 °C enhances the ability to
disperse copper aggregates and promotes the formation of isolated
copper ions. In fact, all copper species are detected as aggregates
for the sample treated at 500 °C, whereas the proportion of copper
ions increases up to 33% in detriment of aggregates for the sample
calcined at 700 °C. A further increase in the SSIE temperature
negatively affects the stability of the SAPO-34 zeolite framework,
leading to some silicon segregation and the loss of specific surface
area and acidity. Besides, copper ions tend to agglomerate to form
small copper clusters inside the zeolite matrix, and the formation
of copper aluminate is favored.

The activation energy of the
NH3-SCR reaction is observed
to be in the range of 37–42 kJ mol–1. Only
the sample prepared at 500 °C presents a somewhat lower activation
energy of 28 kJ mol–1, which suggests some changes
in the reaction mechanism ascribed to the absence of copper ions.
The Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared at 700 °C by SSIE presents the
best NH3-SCR performance revealed by the highest reaction
rate, which was attributed to a higher content of Cu2+ ions.
However, very similar TOF values are obtained irrespective of the
SSIE temperature, which suggests that copper ions are the main active
specie for NH3-SCR.

The SAPO-34 zeolite presents
a limited capacity to incorporate
copper by liquid ion exchange (LIE). The signal intensity due to Cu2+ ions increases linearly up to a copper content of 1.7 wt
%, whereas the signal intensity tends to saturate for higher copper
loadings, indicating that almost all of the exchangeable locations
of the zeolite are already occupied. Thus, copper is preferably incorporated
as copper aggregates instead of copper ions for high copper loadings.
The presence of residual Na+ negatively affects the NH3-SCR performance of catalysts prepared by LIE, whereas a temperature
increase during the calcination step up to 700 °C does not significantly
change the activity of the sample. On the other hand, SSIE permits
the incorporation of copper to a larger extent. However, the signal
intensity due to Cu2+ ions is maximum for a copper loading
of 3.7 wt % and does not further increase with copper loading, revealing
again an upper limit to incorporate copper ions by SSIE.

The
NH3-SCR reaction activation energies for samples
prepared by LIE and SSIE with different copper loadings are in the
ranges of 40–47 and 32–38 kJ mol–1, respectively. Specifically, the sample prepared by LIE with a copper
loading of 1.1 wt % presents a lower activation energy, i.e., 19 kJ
mol–1, which could be a consequence of a different
reaction mechanism due to such a low copper loading. The highest reaction
rate values are observed for Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts with low copper
loading prepared by either LIE or SSIE due to the preference formation
of copper ions instead of aggregates. Very similar TOF values are
recorded irrespective of copper loading for catalysts prepared by
LIE. Contrarily, a decreasing tendency in TOF is observed for samples
prepared by SSIE with increasing copper loading due to a notable penalization
of specific surface area. It is observed that TOF values are higher
for catalysts prepared by SSIE rather than LIE, which promotes NH3-SCR.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Catalyst Preparation
Liquid ion exchange
(LIE) and solid-state ion exchange (SSIE) were used for preparing
Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts. The following procedure was used for LIE. First,
H-SAPO-34 powder was contacted with 0.1 M NaNO3 solution
to obtain Na/SAPO-34. The ion exchange was conducted for 24 h with
continuous stirring at ambient temperature and neutral pH (≈7).
The powder was obtained following filtration, washing, and drying
overnight at 110 °C. The Na exchange and drying were repeated
twice to maximize the exchange ratio, and afterward the sample was
calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. Then, Cu/SAPO-34 powder was obtained
by ion exchanging Na/SAPO-34 with adequate amounts of Cu(COOCH3)2 (Panreac, 98%) aqueous solution. This solution
(8 g L–1) was stirred for 24 h at 60 °C maintaining
the pH value at 6 by ammonia addition (25% as NH3, Panreac).
The suspension was then filtered, washed with deionized water, and
dried overnight at 110 °C. Finally, the Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst was
obtained by calcining the powder at 500 °C for 4 h.

On
the other hand, SSIE Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared by physically
mixing H-SAPO-34 and adequate amounts of CuO nanopowder (Sigma-Aldrich).
The precursors were thoroughly mixed until a homogeneous solid was
obtained, and afterward calcination was carried out in a reactor placed
in a tubular furnace with an airflow of 130 mL min–1. Temperature was elevated from room temperature to the selected
maximum temperature (500–800 °C) with a temperature ramp
of 1 °C min–1, and temperature was maintained
in an isothermal step for 12 h. SSIE Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts were successfully
synthesized via this method.

3.2 Catalyst Characterization
3.2.1 X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)
Wavelength-dispersive
XRF analysis was carried out with an AXIOS PANalytical spectrometer
equipped with a Rh tube. Prior to the analysis, the sample (200 mg)
was mixed with Spectromelt A10 to a solvent/sample weight ratio of
20:1. The melted mixture was poured into a beaker to create a glass
disk for analysis.

3.2.2 Surface Area
Textural properties
were evaluated from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms,
determined at −196 °C with a Micromeritics TriStar II
3020 apparatus. The specific surface areas of the samples were determined
with the standard Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) procedure,
using nitrogen adsorption in the relative equilibrium pressure interval
of 0.05–0.2. The samples were previously degassed overnight
under nitrogen flow at 300 °C.

3.2.3 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD)
The XRD
patterns of the samples were obtained in a Philips PW1710 diffractometer.
The samples were finely ground and were subjected to Cu Kα radiation
in the continuous scan mode from 5 to 90° of 2θ with 0.02°
s–1 sampling interval. PANalytical X’pert
HighScore specific software was used for data treatment.

3.2.4 Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)
EPR spectra
were recorded with a Bruker ELEXSYS 500 spectrometer
operating at the X-band. The magnetic field was calibrated with an RMN test tube, and the frequency was measured into the cavity
with a microwave integrated counter. The temperature was stabilized
with an Oxford Instrument regulator (ITC4) at −150 °C.
Samples were analyzed in their hydrated form due to exposure to the
environment before the analysis.

3.2.5 Temperature-Programmed
Reduction (H2-TPR)
Reducibility of Cu in the catalyst
was investigated
by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) using H2 in Micromeritics
AutoChem II. The sample (0.25 g) was pretreated in 50 mL min–1 of 5% O2/He gas flow at 450 °C for 60 min and then
cooled down. Then, the sample was heated from room temperature to
900 °C with 10 °C min–1 ramp in a 50 mL
min–1 of 5% H2/Ar mixture gas flow. Water
formed during reduction with H2 was trapped using a cold
trap, and hydrogen consumption was continuously monitored with a calibrated
thermal conductivity detector (TCD).

3.2.6 Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Copper distribution and the size
of copper aggregates were studied
using a JEOL JSM-7000F scanning electron microscope equipped with
a Schottky field emission gun and an Oxford Inca Pentafet X3 energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analyzer. The EDX microanalysis was performed at 20 kV,
with a working distance of 10 mm.

3.2.7 Ultraviolet–Visible
Spectroscopy
(UV–Vis)
The oxidation states and the coordination
of Cu species were evaluated by diffuse reflectance UV–vis
spectroscopy (UV–visible–NIR DRS) with a UV–vis–NIR
Cary 5000 apparatus coupled to Diffuse Reflectance Internal 2500 within
a range of 200–2500 nm. Prior to the analysis, the samples
were dehydrated in air at 350 °C during 3 h.

3.2.8 Temperature-Programmed Desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD)
The acidity of the samples
was determined in a Micromeritics AutoChem II equipment. The sample
(0.08 g) was first pretreated in N2 with a total flow rate
of 50 mL min–1 from room temperature to 550 °C
with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min–1. Then,
10% NH3/He was fed at 100 °C until saturation, followed
by a purge with 50 mL min–1 of He for 1 h to desorb
physisorbed NH3. Finally, the sample was heated from 100
to 550 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min–1 in 50 mL min–1 of He. The effluent of the reactor
was continuously measured by a TCD detector to quantify the NH3 desorption profile.

3.3 Reactor
Experiments
3.3.1 Selective Catalytic Reduction
(NH3-SCR)
The SCR experiments were performed in
a down-flow
stainless steel reactor. The reactor tube, with 0.8 g of 0.3–0.5
mm pelletized Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst inside, was located into a three-zone
tube furnace. The temperature was measured by a thermocouple at the
top of the catalyst bed. The reaction temperature was varied from
150 to 500 °C in steps of 50 °C. The composition of the
feed gas mixture was 660 ppm NO, 660 ppm NH3, and 6% O2 using Ar as the balance gas. Gases were fed via mass flow
controllers, and the total flow rate was set at 2880 mL min–1, which corresponded to a space velocity (gas hourly space velocity)
of 86 500 h–1. The NO, NO2, NH3, and N2O concentrations at the reactor exit were
monitored every 50 °C, once the analysis had been stabilized
for at least 10 min, by an online Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
multigas analyzer (MKS 2030).

The NO (XNO) and NH3 (XNH3) conversions were calculated as 1   2  and the N2, NO2, and
N2O selectivities, named SN2, SNO2, and SN2O, respectively, were calculated
as 3   4   5  where Fi represents
the molar flux of “i” species. The superscripts “in”
and “out” indicate the molar flow rate being evaluated
at the inlet and the exit of the reactor, respectively.

The
initial reaction rate approach was employed to determine apparent
activation energies. The initial reaction rate was determined with
specific experiments carried out under the differential reactor regime,
assuring that the NO conversion was below 15% in the whole studied
temperature range. The feedstream composition was 660 ppm NO, 660
ppm NH3, and 6% O2 using Ar as the balance gas.
The NO molar flow at the reactor inlet (FNO) was 2.926 × 10–6 mol s–1, and the catalyst weight (W) was 0.15 g. Previous
experiments confirmed that under the experimental conditions, external
and internal diffusion resistances are neglected, thus assuring that
the observed reaction rate is due to a kinetically controlled regime
(Figure S1). Under the differential reactor
regime, the initial reaction rate (−rNOo, mol NO g–1 s–1) can be evaluated by the following
expression: (−rNOo) = XNO/(W/FNOo), where XNO represents
the conversion of NO.16 The initial reaction
rate is normalized per mol of copper (mol NO (mol Cu)−1 s–1) dividing the reaction rate by the moles of
copper per catalyst gram. Also, the turnover frequency (TOF) can be
calculated by dividing the reaction rate normalized per mol of copper
by the fraction of copper ions. The representation of the natural
logarithm of the initial reaction rate versus the inverse of the reaction
temperature allows the evaluation of the apparent activation energy
(Ea) from the slope of the linear fitting
to the experimental data.

4 Results
and Discussion
4.1 Influence of Solid-State
Ion-Exchange (SSIE)
Temperature
For this aim, known amounts of CuO and H-SAPO-34
were mixed and submitted to high temperature, namely, 500, 600, 650,
700, 750, and 800 °C, to favor the solid-state ion exchange.
As for reference, a physical mixture of CuO and H-SAPO-34 sample was
also prepared without calcination (WO/C). The Al2O3/P2O5/SiO2 molar composition
of the bare H-SAPO-34 was 0.35:0.28:0.15, which was maintained unaltered
after the SSIE procedure.

Because some of the SSIE conditions
could produce some adverse effect on catalytic behavior of samples,
XRD was used to monitor the integrity of the SAPO-34 structure after
SSIE. Figure S2 shows X-ray diffraction
patterns of prepared catalysts, also including an uncalcined sample
and the bare zeolite. The bare zeolite and catalysts prepared at temperatures
lower than 700 °C resulted in very similar XRD patterns, which
assures that the zeolite structure and crystallinity were maintained
unaltered after SSIE. The unique exception with respect to the H-SAPO-34
diffraction pattern is the presence of peaks located at 35.5 and 38.5°
2θ attributed to the presence of copper oxide.17 This fact suggests that some fraction of copper is probably
not ion exchanged and remains as copper aggregates, as any copper
ion was not detectable by XRD.18,19 On the other hand,
XRD patterns corresponding to samples calcined at temperatures higher
than 700 °C presented an additional phase with a characteristic
diffraction peak situated at 21°. This peak, ascribed to silicon
dioxide (SiO2),13,20 was evident for the
Cu/SAPO-34 sample calcined at 750 °C and became the main diffraction
peak for the sample treated at 800 °C. Thus, it can be concluded
that chemical structure stability of SAPO-34 zeolite was significantly
affected only when using temperatures higher than 750 °C, leading
to some silicon segregation from the zeolite framework.

Table 1 lists the
copper loading and the specific surface area of prepared samples.
The elemental composition of samples is reported in Table S1. As can be observed, all catalysts presented very
similar copper loadings, around 4.2%. The interaction between copper
and zeolite reduces the specific surface area from 600 to 450 m2 g–1 for samples calcined at temperatures
below 700 °C, which is assigned to partial pore blockage by copper
aggregates. Further increase in the calcination temperature above
750 °C provokes a decrease in the specific surface area, which
resulted in 403 and 270 m2 g–1 for 750
and 800 °C, respectively. This specific surface area reduction
is directly related with a partial destruction of the zeolite framework,
as already evidenced by XRD (Figure S2).

and Total Acidity of Samples Prepared by SSIE at Different Temperatures

SEM images were recorded to examine the morphology
of SAPO-34 zeolite
and determine the size of copper aggregates in the samples prepared
under different calcination temperatures. As can be observed in Figure 1, perfect cubic crystals
(in light gray) were observed irrespective of calcination temperature,
which is in line with the large crystallinity of SAPO-34 detected
by XRD. The size of those crystals was rather homogeneous, in the
range 2–5 μm, in accordance with previous results in
the literature.13,18,21 Large and numerous copper aggregates (detectable by lighter areas
due to the higher atomic number of copper) could be easily observed
for the sample calcined at 500 °C (Figure 1a). The number and size of aggregates were
progressively reduced while increasing the calcination temperature,
as can be observed in Figure 1b for the Cu/SAPO-34 sample calcined at 750 °C. Additional
SEM images for the remaining catalysts prepared by SSIE at different
temperatures are provided in Figure S3.
Thus, it can be concluded that increasing the SSIE calcination temperature
enhances the ability to disperse copper aggregates, leading to smaller
CuxOy clusters
or even copper ions (Cu2+) not detectable by SEM. However,
it was evidenced that irrespective of thermal treatment temperature,
it was not possible to accomplish complete dispersion of Cu, as copper
aggregates located outside the pores of the zeolite were still easily
detectable after SSIE.

at (a)
500 °C and (b) 750 °C.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to characterize isolated Cu2+ ions,13,22−24 including aggregated CuO species, and Cu+ ions are EPR silent.25−27Figure 2 shows EPR spectra for Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts prepared under different
SSIE temperatures, also with a physical mixture of CuO and H-SAPO-34
as reference. All samples presented a characteristic feature at low
field (around 1500 G, not shown) attributed to the presence of Fe3+ ions.28,29 The intensity of this signal
changed from sample to sample, indicating a nonhomogeneous distribution
of Fe3+, which made the quantification of the Cu2+ ion content more challenging. Qualitatively, the obtained spectra
presented a unique feature in the high-field region at 3270 G, whereas
copper hyperfine features are evident at low field. The intensities
of low- and high-field features were observed to clearly increase
with SSIE temperature. It is worth noting that detection of an additional
feature at high field (3315 G) for the sample calcined at 800 °C
suggests the presence of two different types of copper ions.

Figure 2 EPR spectra
for the Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared by SSIE at different
temperatures. The inset of the figure represents the signal intensity
calculated by double integral of the original signal in the 2500–3500
field range.

A double integration of the signal
presented in Figure 2 in the magnetic field range
of 2500–3500 G is shown in the inside figure, which allows
a semiquantitative comparison among the prepared samples. As can be
observed, signal intensity due to the presence of isolated Cu2+ ions increases monotonically with SSIE temperature up to
700 °C. Afterward, the signal intensity tends to be saturated
or even decrease, which suggests that further increase of temperature
above 700 °C did not result in the formation of higher amount
of copper ions. By analyzing the hyperfine features, g∥ = 2.39 and A∥ = 132 G are obtained, which is consistent with an octahedral coordination
of Cu2+ ions.

Figure 3 shows H2 consumption profiles from temperature-programmed
reduction
(H2-TPR) experiments for Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts prepared
by SSIE under different calcination temperatures. Generally, the reduction
of Cu2+ ions in zeolites takes place through two consecutive
steps, i.e., Cu2+ ions reduce to Cu+ and subsequent
reduction of Cu+ ions to Cu0.16,25,30,31 Moreover,
it has been reported that reduction of CuO nanoparticles to Cu0 occurs in a single step at around 300 °C.16,32 However, in accordance with results reported by Wang et al.,33 we determined experimentally that a physical
mixture of CuO and SAPO-34 zeolite presented a single reduction peak
located at a lower temperature, ca. 260 °C (bottom left graphic
in Figure 3), undoubtedly
assigned to reduction of CuO aggregates to Cu0.

Figure 3 H2 consumption profiles during H2-TPR experiments
for the Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared by SSIE at different temperatures.
Experiments with a physical mixture of CuO and
SAPO-34 without being calcined (WO/C) and copper aluminate are also
included as a reference.

The SSIE procedure at
500 °C did not modify the redox behavior
of the sample with respect to the physical mixture CuO/SAPO-34. However,
some changes started becoming evident for the sample submitted to
SSIE at 600 °C, i.e., a small H2 consumption peak
centered around 320 °C started to develop. Reduction of Cu2+ ions to Cu+ has been reported to occur at temperatures
lower than 250 °C,16,25,34 whereas subsequent reduction of Cu+ ions to Cu0 occurs at higher temperatures. Thus, we are considering that reduction
of Cu2+ ions to Cu+ occurs around 230 °C,
reduction of large copper aggregates occurs around 260 °C, and
final reduction of Cu+ ions occurs at 320 °C. Note
that coexistence of copper ions (Cu2+) and CuO aggregates
has been already evidenced by EPR and SEM, respectively, in the prepared
samples.

It was not straightforward to determine the size and
amplitude
of the low-temperature H2 consumption contribution due
to reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ ions. However, the
observed H2/Cu ratio for the whole H2-TPR experiment
(Table 2) is very close
to 1 in all cases, which indicates that all copper exist in an oxidation
state +2 in the original sample; thus, the area of the low-temperature
contribution (Cu2+ → Cu+) located at
230 °C should be very close to the area of the high-temperature
contribution (Cu+ → Cu0) located at 320
°C.

Samples treated at temperatures higher than
700 °C required
an additional contribution to adequately describe the observed H2 consumption profile. In particular, this contribution was
located at 300 °C and was assigned to the reduction of nanosized
copper clusters (CuxOy),16 which interact more strongly
with the support and consequently require higher temperatures than
that needed for large copper aggregates (260 °C) to be reduced.
This observation is in agreement with results previously reported
by Gao et al.13 who attributed the temperature
shift of the major reduction peak to higher temperatures associated
with changes in dispersion of the CuO nanoparticles.

Finally,
samples treated at temperatures higher than 600 °C
presented an additional H2 consumption contribution centered
around 450 °C with a long tail up to 650 °C. This contribution
was assigned to the reduction of highly stable copper ions in the
copper aluminate (CuAl2O4) phase, whose formation
has already been reported for copper zeolites under specific preparation
conditions.13,35 To verify this assignation, bulk
CuAl2O4 was synthesized by mixing nanopowder
CuO and γ-Al2O3 and calcining the physical
mixture at 1000 °C. The H2-TPR experiment included
in Figure 3 (top right
graphic) revealed a main hydrogen consumption peak at 430 °C
for CuAl2O4, which validates the previous assignation.
It is worth noting that the presence of CuAl2O4 begins to be significant for temperatures higher than 750 °C,
in line with detection of some segregated silicon oxide from the zeolite
framework by XRD. Thus, it seems that such a high temperature is able
to produce a partial destruction of the zeolite framework, leading
to some recombination of atoms to form SiO2 and CuAl2O4 along with the original SAPO-34. Furthermore,
formation of CuAl2O4 can also be well correlated
with detection of two different types of Cu2+ ions by EPR
for samples treated at 750 and 800 °C.

Integration of H2 consumption peaks observed in Figure 3 with time permitted
us to calculate the amount of hydrogen (μmol H2 g–1) consumed during reduction of copper ions in sequential
steps, reduction of copper aggregates and copper clusters, and reduction
of copper aluminate, following a similar trend to that reported elsewhere.36−39 Furthermore, it was possible to determine the relative abundance
of different types of copper species in the original sample (Table 2) based on reduction
stoichiometry. For example, the sample treated at 700 °C presented
a hydrogen consumption of 107.2 μmol H2 g–1 for reduction of Cu2+ ions to Cu+ ions, which
means that 214.4 μmol Cu2+ g–1 was
present in the original sample based on its reduction stoichiometry:
Cu2+ + 1/2H2 → Cu+ + H+. Then, 136.0 and 175.1 μmol H2 g–1 were used for reduction of copper aggregates and copper clusters,
respectively, both following the same reduction stoichiometry: CuO
+ H2 → Cu0 + H2O, which results
in contents of copper aggregates and clusters of 136.0 and 175.1 μmol
g–1, respectively. The amount of hydrogen used for
reduction of Cu+ ions to metallic copper was 113.9 μmol
H2 g–1. However, calculation of the amount
of Cu+ ions in the original sample requires subtraction
of hydrogen consumption due to reduction of Cu+ ions coming
from Cu2+ ion reduction. Thus, hydrogen consumption attributed
to Cu+ ion reduction can be calculated by 113.9–107.2
μmol H2 = 6.7 μmol H2 g–1, and taking into account the reduction stoichiometry (Cu+ + 1/2H2 → Cu0 + H+), the
content of Cu+ ions results in 13.3 μmol g–1. Finally, hydrogen consumption due to reduction of copper aluminate
was 106.4 μmol H2 g–1, and consequently
the amount of copper aluminate was 106.4 μmol g–1 based on its reduction stoichiometry (CuAl2O4 + H2 → Cu0 + Al2O3 + H2O).

The proportions of different types of copper
species are tabulated
in Table 2. As can
be observed, SSIE carried out at 500 °C is not able to produce
any change with respect to the noncalcined sample, and all copper
remained as aggregates. Further increase in the calcination temperature
up to 600 °C results in the formation of copper ions in detriment
of large aggregates. The proportion of Cu2+ ions increased
progressively with SSIE temperature, reaching a maximum value of 33%
at 700 °C, in line with EPR results, whereas the proportion of
CuO aggregates is complementarily reduced. Small copper clusters begin
to become detectable for SSIE temperatures of 700 °C and onward.
A further temperature increase up to 800 °C penalized formation
of copper ions probably due to agglomeration of copper ions to form
small copper clusters inside the zeolite framework. The proportion
of Cu+ ions was below 6% for all prepared samples, in line
with experimentally detected H2/Cu ∼ 1 as experimentally
determined. Finally, copper aluminate started to become detectable
at calcination temperature of 600 °C with progressive promotion
of its formation with temperature, reaching a maximum value of 29%
at 800 °C. To sum up, it can be concluded that progressive increase
in the temperature at which SSIE is carried out favors the formation
of copper ions up to 700 °C, whereas further temperature increase
promotes the formation of small copper clusters and copper aluminate.

Table 1 also includes
the total acidity of samples determined by NH3-TPD. As
can be observed, the total acidity of samples increased progressively
with SSIE temperature up to 650 °C. This fact is ascribed to
the formation of Cu2+ ions, providing the catalyst with
a higher amount of Lewis acid sites that promotes NH3 storage.21,27,33,40 However, total acidity of samples tends to decrease when SSIE was
carried out at temperatures higher than 650 °C. Note that total
acidity of the sample prepared by SSIE at 800 °C was even lower
than that observed for the bare zeolite. We suggest, in accordance
with XRD results, that such a high temperature is able to produce
a partial destruction of the zeolite framework (evidenced by SiO2 segregation), which ultimately reduces the population of
Brönsted acid sites and leads to a lower NH3 adsorption
capacity. Besides, the formation of copper clusters, in detriment
to copper ions, while increasing the SSIE temperature above 700 °C
also reduces the availability of Lewis acid sites to store NH3.

UV–vis DRS spectra were determined to complete
the analysis
of copper species in the prepared samples by SSIE.22,27 The overall spectra (Figure S4) are similar
to those reported for Cu-zeolites such as Cu/SSZ-13,11 as well as Cu/SAPO-34.21,41,42 Two main characteristic absorption bands were observed
for all of the samples. The one centered at ca. 240 nm is attributed
to a charge transfer band of the zeolite,21,43 and a broad band in the region of 300–800 nm was attributed
to the presence of CuO,11 as evidenced
by the UV–vis spectra of a physical mixture of CuO and H-SAPO-34
and also the bulk CuO sample. This broad band is composed of several
bands at ca. 355 and 456 nm assigned to the charge transfer bands
of O–Cu–O and Cu–O–Cu complexes, respectively,44,45 and a broad absorption band at 600–800 nm assigned to the
electron d–d transitions of Cu2+ in distorted octahedral
coordination surrounded by oxygen in dispersed CuO particles.21,45 As can be observed, the physical mixture of CuO and H-SAPO-34 presents
a broad absorption band in the Ultraviolet–visible and near-infrared
region, i.e., 300–800 nm. The absorption intensity was progressively
reduced on increasing the SSIE temperature until it became minimum
for treating temperatures of 700 °C, revealing that the population
of aggregated CuO species was progressively reduced. Finally, SSIE
temperatures of 750 and 800 °C presented a higher absorption
intensity around 350–600 nm, assigned to the presence of copper
aluminate.11

Figure 4 illustrates
NO and NH3 conversions and selectivity toward N2, N2O, and NO2 as a function of the reaction
temperature during NH3-SCR experiments with the Cu/SAPO-34
catalyst prepared by SSIE at different temperatures. As can be observed,
the catalyst prepared at 500 °C presents very limited NH3-SCR performance, reaching a maximum NO conversion of 58%
at 300 °C (Figure 4a). Increasing temperature at which SSIE is performed results in
a noteworthy enhancement of NO conversion. In fact, the Cu/SAPO-34
catalyst prepared at 600 °C obtained maximum NO conversion of
98% at 300 °C. NH3-SCR activity enhancement can be
related to formation of copper ions in detriment of large aggregates,
and, thus, points out that these copper ions are more active than
aggregates. Further increase in the SSIE temperature up to 750 °C
results in a broadening of the NO conversion performance, increasing
low- and high-temperature NH3-SCR activity. Although the
contents of large copper aggregates and small copper clusters changed
markedly among samples calcined at 650, 700, and 750 °C, they
presented almost identical NH3-SCR activity due to comparable
amounts of copper ions, situated in the range of 26–33% (Table 2). Further temperature
increase up to 800 °C favored the migration of copper ions into
the partially destroyed zeolite matrix to form CuAl2O4, which reduces the availability of copper species at the
surface to activate the NH3-SCR reaction and consequently
presents a lower NH3-SCR activity specifically at low temperatures.
Furthermore, the lower catalytic activity of the sample calcined at
800 °C could be also correlated with the lower specific surface
area and lower acidity (Table 1).

Figure 4 Evaluation of NH3-SCR performance for samples prepared
by SSIE at different temperatures: (a) NO conversion, (b) NH3 conversion, (c) N2 and N2O selectivities,
and (d) NO2 selectivity.

NH3 conversion (Figure 4b) follows a similar trend to that observed for NO,
but specifically it can be observed that the sample prepared at 750
°C presents the highest NH3 conversion in the whole
studied temperature range. At high temperature, the NH3 oxidation reaction starts to prevail and thus total NH3 conversion is obtained for temperatures of 400 °C and onward
for all prepared catalysts.8,46 Reaction between NH3 and oxygen reduces the availability of the reductant and
consequently NO conversion starts to decrease for temperatures higher
than 400 °C, as already observed in Figure 4a.

Figure 4c shows
the selectivity toward N2 and N2O, whereas Figure 4d presents the selectivity
toward NO2 in the studied temperature range. As can be
observed, all prepared samples presented high selectivity to nitrogen
and reduced selectivity to N2O. Selectivities to N2 and N2O are complementary up to 350 °C; formation
of NO2 becomes significant only at higher temperatures
due to the NO-to-NO2 oxidation reaction. Focusing on N2O selectivity, a progressive increase with temperature can
be observed, although it is always maintained below 5%. Specifically,
the sample prepared at 500 °C presented higher N2O
selectivity, showing a maximum of 10% around 300 °C, which is
related to the decomposition of ammonium nitrate.47,48 Besides, this sample also presented a notable higher NO2 selectivity, reaching 22% at 500 °C. Thus, it can be suggested
that copper species have a notable impact on the NH3-SCR
product distribution. Large copper aggregates favor the formation
of N2O and enhance the oxidation capacity of the sample,
promoting selectivity to NO2. On the other hand, copper
ions, even if they are in a minor relative abundance with respect
to aggregates or clusters, are able to drive the NH3-SCR
reaction selectively toward nitrogen.

To better discern the
NH3-SCR activity of the prepared
samples, additional reaction experiments were carried out under a
differential reactor regime assuring that NO conversion was maintained
below 15% in the whole studied temperature range for easy calculation
of the initial reaction rate, activation energy, and turnover frequency
(TOF); these values are listed in Table S3. Figure 5 shows the
Arrhenius plot to calculate apparent activation energies. As can be
observed, irrespective of the temperature at which SSIE was carried
out, the apparent activation energy was around 40 kJ mol–1, which means that the NH3-SCR reaction proceeds through
the same reaction mechanism. The observed activation energy is very
close to that reported by Hu et al.49 with
Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts prepared by one-pot synthesis and different crystal
sizes of zeolite, i.e., 44.8 kJ mol–1. Besides,
Hu et al. provided different activation energies from other works16,21,25,33,50,51 using Cu/SAPO-34
catalysts at different reaction temperatures (100–225 °C)
and copper loadings (0.35–6.78 wt %), revealing that all were
situated between 34 and 45 kJ mol–1. Specifically,
the sample prepared by SSIE at 500 °C presented a lower activation
energy of 28 kJ mol–1. Specific experiments were
carried out with this sample verifying the absence of internal diffusion
limitations (Figure S1). Changes in the
activation energy at low temperatures (<250 °C) were also
reported by Gao et al.,23 who justified
this observation by assuming that different types of active centers
or locations were affecting the kinetic analysis. In this sense, we
can speculate that the different activation energy observed for the
sample prepared by SSIE at 500 °C is due to the presence of large
copper aggregates as the main active center, although the presence
of small quantities of copper ions cannot be totally ruled out due
to migration of copper species under standard SCR conditions.12,52,53 On the other hand, all remaining
samples presented a noticeable portion of copper ions, which led to
the same activation energy.

Figure 5 Arrhenius plot for the determination of the
activation energy for
samples prepared by SSIE at different temperatures. (Note the logarithmic
scale in the Y axis.)

More specifically, the reaction rate normalized per mol of copper,
−rNO (mol NO (mol Cu)−1 s–1), and the turnover frequency, TOF (s–1), were calculated. TOF values have been normalized to the total
amount of Cu2+ ions,24,49 as those species have
been considered the active site for NH3-SCR.50,54,55 Additionally, we have also included
the calculation of TOF based on the total amount of copper ions (Cu2+ and Cu+). On the other hand, the reaction rate
normalized per mol of copper (−rNO) has also been used to compare the NH3-SCR activity of
different catalysts.21,56,57 In the present study, we have calculated the reaction rate normalized
per mol of copper, (−rNO), by dividing
the reaction rate by the moles of Cu per gram of catalyst. TOF has
been calculated by dividing the reaction rate normalized per mol of
copper by the fraction of Cu2+ ions or by the fraction
of total copper ions (Cu2+ and Cu+) quantitatively
determined by H2-TPR (Table 2).

Figure 6a shows
the evolution of the reaction rate normalized per mol of copper at
200 °C for catalysts prepared by SSIE at different temperatures.
As can be observed, the evolution of (−rNO) with SSIE temperature presents a maximum at 700 °C
(4.5 × 10–3 mol NO (mol Cu)−1 s–1). The reaction rate profile correlates very
well to the proportion of copper ions, which was maximum (33%) for
the sample prepared at 700 °C. Thus, it can be deduced that Cu2+ ions are the main active species for NH3-SCR,
although large copper aggregates also present some activity based
on the reaction rate calculated for the sample calcined at 500 °C
(1.2 × 10–3 mol NO (mol Cu)−1 s–1). At this point, it is worth noting that recent
papers12,52,53,58−61 have suggested the mobility of copper species under
NH3-SCR conditions, and thus, the speciation of copper
may shift during activity measurements. Figure 6b shows the evolution of TOF referred to
the content of Cu2+ ions or the total content of Cu ions
for the prepared samples except for that calcined at 500 °C,
in which copper ions are absent. As can be observed, similar TOF values,
around 12 × 10–3 s–1, are
observed irrespective of calcination temperature, which suggests the
presence of similar copper ions with the same NH3-SCR activity,
as already reported elsewhere.16 A similar
trend is observed when TOF is referred to the total amount of copper
ions.

total amount of copper ions or alternatively to the amount of Cu2+ ions quantified by H2-TPR.

4.2 Influence of Copper Loading in Cu/SAPO-34
Samples Prepared by Liquid Ion Exchange (LIE) and Solid-State Ion
Exchange (SSIE)
Four Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared by
liquid ion exchange (LIE) and subsequent calcination at 500 °C.
Different copper concentrations were used in the starting solution
to achieve increasing copper loading in the prepared samples. On the
other hand, five Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared by SSIE at the
optimum temperature as deduced in the previous section, i.e., 700
°C, with nominal copper loadings of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wt %.

Table 3 lists the
copper loading, BET surface area, and acidity of the prepared samples
by SSIE and LIE. The complete elemental composition of samples is
reported in Table S2. As can be observed,
BET surface area slightly decreases after the LIE procedure with respect
to bare zeolite (600 m2 g–1). However,
Cu loading does not have a great impact on surface area, which remains
around 489–517 m2 g–1, with a
slight tendency to decrease with increasing Cu loading due to the
preferential formation of some copper aggregates. When comparing LIE
and SSIE samples with similar Cu content, it can be observed that
the specific surface area is notably higher for samples prepared by
LIE. Specifically, the sample prepared by LIE with a copper loading
of 3.6% presented a specific surface area of 489 m2 g–1, which is notably higher than that presented by the
sample prepared by SSIE with a copper loading of 3.7%, 397 m2 g–1. Note that specific surface area critically
decreases for copper loadings higher than 6% for samples prepared
by SSIE due to pore blockage by copper aggregates. In fact, the specific
surface area of the sample with a nominal copper loading of 10% decreases
to 44 m2 g–1.

and Total Acidity of Samples Prepared by LIE and SSIE

Figure S5 shows XRD diffraction patterns
of prepared LIE and SSIE samples. XRD patterns confirmed that the
SAPO-34 framework was maintained unaltered after LIE, without significant
crystallinity loss, irrespective of Cu loading. Furthermore, CuO characteristic
diffraction peaks, located at 35.5 and 38.5° 2θ, were not
detected even for a high copper-loaded catalyst, suggesting that isolated
copper ions or highly dispersed CuxOy clusters, both beyond the XRD detection limit,18,19 are predominant copper species in samples prepared by LIE. On the
other hand, all catalysts prepared by SSIE presented diffraction peaks
attributed to CuO with increasing intensity as increasing copper loading.
Besides, all catalysts also presented some SiO2 segregation
detected at 21°. The intensity of that diffraction peak increased
notably with copper loading, revealing that high copper loading favors
collapse of the zeolite structure, which can also be evidenced by
the almost total disappearance of the main diffraction peak of SAPO-34
situated at 10°.

Figure 7 shows SEM
images of catalysts prepared by LIE and SSIE. On the one hand, it
was difficult to find copper aggregates by SEM in low copper-loaded
samples prepared by LIE. In particular, only two large CuO aggregates
with a particle size around 1 μm were observed for the 1.7%
Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst (Figure 7a). The picture changed radically for the 3.6% Cu/SAPO-34
catalyst, where a very large number of CuO particles were easily distinguishable
(Figure 7b). On the
other hand, numerous large copper particles were evident even for
the low copper-loaded catalyst prepared by SSIE (1.9% Cu/SAPO-34, Figure 7c), and the number
of those aggregates further increased with copper loading (9.8% Cu/SAPO-34, Figure 7d). From Figure 7, it can be also
inferred that SSIE reduces crystallinity of the zeolite (as already
observed by XRD), as the perfect cubic crystals observed for catalysts
prepared by LIE tend to become highly irregular after the temperature
treatment during SSIE.

Figure 7 SEM images for the Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared by LIE
with copper
loadings of 1.7% (a) and 3.6% (b) and SSIE with copper loadings of
1.9% (c) and 9.8% (d).

EPR spectra for samples
prepared by LIE and SSIE are displayed
in Figure 8a,b, respectively.
The catalyst prepared by LIE presented a unique feature at high field
and well-resolved copper hyperfine features at low fields. On the
contrary, samples prepared by SSIE presented an additional feature
at high field (3323 G) for samples with a copper loading above 6%,
whose intensity increases with copper loading and can be related to
the presence of copper aluminate. The copper ion signal intensity
calculated by a double integral can be observed in the inset of each
figure. As can be observed, Cu2+ signal intensity increases
linearly for samples prepared by LIE up to a copper loading of 1.7
wt %, whereas for higher copper loadings, the signal intensity tends
to saturate, indicating that almost all exchangeable locations of
the zeolite have already been occupied and only a few more copper
ions can be included by LIE. A similar trend was observed for samples
prepared by SSIE, but instead the signal intensity increased linearly
up to a copper loading of 3.7 wt %. A higher copper loading did not
result in a signal intensity increase, which also reveals an upper
limit to incorporate copper ions by SSIE.

Figure 8 EPR spectra for the Cu/SAPO-34
catalyst prepared by LIE and SSIE
with varying copper loadings. The insets of the figures represent
the signal intensity calculated by the double integral of the original
signal in the 2500–3500 field range.

Figure 9 shows H2 consumption profiles during temperature-programmed reduction
(H2-TPR) experiments for Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts prepared
by LIE and SSIE with different copper loadings. Focusing on samples
prepared by LIE and following the previous assignation, the low-temperature
peak (240 °C) was ascribed to the reduction of Cu2+ ions to Cu+. At higher temperatures (300 °C), reduction
of small copper clusters to metallic copper occurred in a single step
(CuO → Cu0), and for high copper loading samples,
an additional hydrogen consumption was observed at somewhat lower
temperatures (280 °C) due to reduction of large copper aggregates.
The final reduction of Cu+ ions to Cu0 was affected
by copper loading. The Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst with copper loadings higher
than 1.7% presented a single reduction contribution around 480 °C.
On the other hand, two contributions were needed to describe Cu+ → Cu0 reduction in low copper-loaded SAPO-34
catalysts; furthermore, Cu+ ion reduction required higher
temperatures. In fact, highly stable Cu+ ion (namely, H-Cu+) reduction occurred at temperatures as high as 790 °C
for the 1.1% Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst, which has already been reported
in the literature.62,63 Torre-Abreu et al.31 have also reported the ease of Cu+ ion reduction with increasing copper loading.

Figure 9 H2 consumption
profiles during H2-TPR experiments
for the Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared by LIE and SSIE with different
copper loadings.

Table 4 shows hydrogen
consumption quantification for each reduction step, i.e., Cu2+ → Cu+, CuO → Cu0, and Cu+ → Cu0, and the proportion of copper species
based on previous H2 consumption and reduction stoichiometry.
Isolated Cu2+ and Cu+ ions were predominant
in low copper loading samples, whereas the proportion of CuO clusters
progressively increased at the expense of copper ions while the copper
content was increased. This fact reveals a limited quantity of exchangeable
sites in SAPO-34 zeolite to accommodate copper ions, in line with
EPR results.

Figure 9 also includes
H2-TPR experiments for Cu/SAPO-34 samples prepared by SSIE
with different copper loadings. The H2 consumption contributions
have been assigned, as in the previous section with SSIE catalysts
calcined at different temperatures, to reduction of Cu2+ ions to Cu+, reduction of large CuO aggregates to Cu0, reduction of small CuO clusters to Cu0, and reduction
of Cu+ ions to Cu0 with increasing reduction
temperature. Figure 9 allows a proper comparison between hydrogen reduction profiles of
samples prepared by LIE and SSIE. The main difference between both
preparation methods is that reduction of Cu2+ and more
notably reduction of Cu+ ions occurred at lower temperatures
for samples prepared by SSIE. We suggest that the LIE preparation
methodology incorporates more specifically copper ions at exchangeable
sites with a higher interaction with the support, e.g., at 6dr windows
of the CHA structure, which hinders their reduction. On the other
hand, copper ions introduced by the SSIE preparation methodology could
be located at CHA cages with lower interaction with the support, which
facilitates their reduction. Besides, formation of copper dimers during
SSIE could also be responsible for shifting the reduction profile
to lower temperatures.64Table 4 also includes the copper species
distribution for samples prepared by SSIE. As can be observed, the
low copper content sample presents the highest proportion of copper
ions, although small copper clusters are the predominant species.
With increasing copper loading, the proportion of copper ions decreased
in favor of copper aggregates and clusters. Finally, the proportion
of CuAl2O4 is similar because the same calcination
protocol was used for all prepared samples and, as deduced from the
previous section, copper aluminate formation is only promoted by the
temperature at which the SSIE procedure took place. In this sense,
copper aluminate is not detected in samples prepared by LIE due to
the lower calcination temperature, i.e., 500 °C.

The NH3-SCR activity of samples prepared by LIE and
SSIE with different copper loadings has been provided in Figure 10. A clear promotion
of low-temperature NH3-SCR activity can be observed for
the LIE catalyst on increasing the copper loading from 1.1 to 2.2%,
as already reported in a previous work64 for β and ZSM-5 zeolites. The promotion of low-temperature
NH3-SCR activity for the SSIE catalyst on increasing the
copper loading was not so evident, and only a slight promotion of
NO conversion was observed from 1.9 to 3.7% of Cu. It is worth noting
that the SSIE preparation methodology resulted in a more active Cu/SAPO-34
catalyst for low-temperature NH3-SCR in comparison to those
prepared by LIE. For example, at 200 °C, NO conversion was 41%
for the 1.7% Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared by LIE, whereas NO conversion
increased up to 74% for the 1.9% Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared by SSIE.
This behavior can be explained by different copper species present
in catalysts prepared by both methodologies and attending to the recently
proposed fast NH3-SCR reaction mechanism,7 which claims that the key step is the formation of a NO2 molecule in the gas phase. The formation of NO2 could occur by two reaction paths: (i) reaction of NO with an adsorbed
nitrate specie, leaving an adsorbed nitrite specie, which then reacts
with NH3 to form N2 and H2O (note
that adsorbed nitrites and nitrates have been detected by FTIR during
the NH3-SCR reaction),65,66 and (ii) direct
oxidation of NO with O2 over Cu sites. Verma et al.67 found that the NO oxidation rate per mol of
Cu was higher in the presence of CuxOy species rather than isolated copper ions. Thus,
the higher NH3-SCR activity for the SSIE preparation methodology
can be linked to the higher oxidation capacity of the catalyst due
to the preferential formation of copper aggregates and clusters, which
can catalyze the oxidation of NO to NO2 readily at low
temperatures and activate the fast NH3-SCR reaction (2NH3 + NO + NO2 → 2N2 + 3H2O). On the other hand, copper ions are the main copper species for
catalysts prepared by LIE, specifically those with low copper loading.
Copper ions are not so active in catalyzing the oxidation of NO to
NO2,67 and consequently in the
absence of gas-phase NO2, the fast SCR is not running and
the reaction proceeds through the standard SCR (4NH3 +
4NO + O2 → 4N2 + 6H2O), which
is known to be slower than the fast SCR.68

Figure 10 Evaluation of NH3-SCR performance for samples prepared
by LIE and SSIE with different copper loadings. (a) NO conversion,
(b) NH3 conversion, (c) N2 and N2O selectivities, and (d) NO2 selectivity.

Copper species also presented an important impact on high-temperature
NH3-SCR activity. The promotion of the oxidation capacity for
SSIE catalysts due to the presence of copper aggregates and clusters
implies some other drawbacks, such as NH3 oxidation starts
becoming significant at intermediate temperatures and thus the high-temperature
NH3-SCR activity is penalized. On the other hand, catalysts
prepared by LIE presented better high-temperature NH3-SCR
activity due to the preferential formation of Cu2+ ions
with lower oxidation capacity.

The higher oxidation ability
of samples prepared by SSIE is evidenced
by a higher selectivity to NO2 at high temperatures. Focusing
on product selectivity, it can be observed that samples prepared by
LIE presented higher nitrogen selectivity than SSIE, irrespective
of copper loading.

The NH3-SCR reaction activation
energies for samples
prepared by LIE and SSIE with different copper loadings (Figure S6) were calculated from experiments carried
out at differential reactor regimes. Calculated reaction rate, activation
energy, and TOF have been listed in Tables S4 and S5. The activation energy was situated around 40–47
kJ mol–1 for samples prepared by LIE, whereas slightly
lower values were observed for SSIE, around 32–38 kJ mol–1. This difference can be related to different mechanisms
running during the NH3-SCR. As already explained, the higher
oxidation capacity of SSIE catalysts promotes oxidation of NO to NO2 and thus activates the fast NH3-SCR, which would
not be running for LIE catalysts due to their lower oxidation capacity.
Specifically, the sample prepared by LIE with a copper loading of
1.1% presented a notably lower activation energy, i.e., 19 kJ mol–1, which could be as a consequence of a different reaction
mechanism due to such a low copper content.

Finally, Figure 11 shows the reaction
rate normalized per mol of copper, −rNO (mol NO (mol Cu)−1 s–1), and turnover frequency (TOF) values at 200 °C
for samples prepared by LIE and SSIE. Focusing on samples prepared
by LIE, a clear decrease of the reaction rate (−rNO) can be observed with increasing copper loading. This
fact can be explained by a progressive increase in the proportion
of copper aggregates with respect to copper ions. On the other hand,
similar TOF values are obtained irrespective of copper loading, i.e.,
12 × 10–3 s–1, which again
evidences that copper ions are the main active site for NH3-SCR. Regarding SSIE catalysts, a decreasing tendency of the reaction
rate (−rNO) is also observed, which again can be
correlated with a higher proportion of copper aggregates as copper
loading is increased. Contrary to samples prepared by LIE, a decreasing
tendency in TOF values is still evident as copper loading is increased
for SSIE samples, specifically for samples with copper loading above
8%. This fact is attributed to a notably lower specific surface area
and acidity of those samples (Table 3). Precise comparison among TOF values obtained by
other works is not straightforward because the reaction conditions
differ from each other. For example, Xue et al.16 found a TOF of 42 × 10–3 s–1 at 200 °C using the Cu-SAPO-34 catalyst and a feedstream composed
of 500 ppm NO, 500 ppm NH3, and 5% O2 with N2 as the balance gas. Hu et al.49 determined a TOF value of 11 × 10–3 s–1 at 200 °C using Cu-SAPO-34 and the same feedstream
composition. The maximum TOF values observed in the present study
are 18 × 10–3 and 24 × 10–3 s–1 for LIE and SSIE methodologies, respectively.
These values lie between the aforementioned TOF values determined
by other authors. Figure 11 also includes two additional samples prepared by ion exchanging
the H/SAPO-34 with NH4NO3 to obtain NH4/SAPO-34 prior to the copper incorporation by LIE and eliminating
the intermediate ion exchange with Na. Then, a fraction of the prepared
sample was calcined at 500 °C and the other at 700 °C. The
copper loading of the prepared catalysts was 2.1%.

Figure 11 Evolution of the reaction
rate and the turnover frequency as a
function of copper loading for samples prepared by LIE (a) and SSIE
(b). TOF values are referred to the total amount of copper ions or
alternatively to the amount of Cu2+ ions quantified by
H2-TPR.

The presence of residual
alkali or alkaline
earth cocations on the activity of NH3-SCR is not clear
in the literature, as some authors claimed a beneficial effect,69 whereas others claimed a detrimental effect
for high contents.70 The prepared LIE catalyst
presented a Na content of around 0.25%, irrespective of the copper
loading, whereas in the absence of Na ion exchange, the Na content
was below the detection limit of the XRF technique (<0.05%). As
can be observed in Figure 11, in the absence of residual Na cocations, the reaction rate
value is increased up to 4.8 × 10–3 s–1, whereas in the presence of residual Na, the (−rNO) is 3 × 10–3 s–1. Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of residual Na cocations
limits the activity of Cu/SAPO-34 to some extent.

Then, the
reaction rate of the Cu/SAPO-34 catalyst prepared in
the absence of Na ion exchange and calcined at the same calcination
temperature as SSIE, i.e., 700 °C, was also compared (Figure 11a). As can be observed,
the temperature increase during the calcination step from 500 up to
700 °C hardly affected the reaction rate, slightly increasing
from 4.8 × 10–3 to 5.1 × 10–3 s–1. Thus, it seems that a temperature increase
during the calcination step of Cu/SAPO-34 catalysts prepared by LIE
in the absence of Na cocations does not critically affect the nature
of copper species and thus the NH3-SCR activity is maintained
constant.

The TOF has been calculated based on the amount of
total copper
ions (Cu2+ and Cu+) or exclusively based on
the amount of Cu2+ ions. The TOF of catalysts prepared
by LIE differs notably when referred to the amount of total copper
ions or Cu2+, as the amount of Cu+ ions is notable
(Table 4). Differences
in TOF are not so noteworthy for catalysts prepared by SSIE due to
the lower amount of Cu+ ions. Using the TOF referred to
the amount of Cu2+ ions, it can be observed that the TOF
for the catalyst prepared by SSIE with a copper loading of 1.9% is
23.2 × 10–3 s–1, which is
notably higher than the TOF calculated for the catalyst prepared by
LIE with a copper loading of 1.7%, i.e., 12.3 × 10–3 s–1. Thus, the SSIE procedure achieves higher
activity per Cu2+ site, which enhances NH3-SCR
activity.
