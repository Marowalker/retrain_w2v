It is well-known that the improvement
in the performance of organic
field-effect transistors (OFETs) relies primarily on growth properties
of organic molecules on gate dielectrics, their interface behavior,
and on understanding the physical processes occurring during device
operation. In this work, the relation of varying the dielectric materials
in an n-type OFET device based on 1,7-dibromo-N,N′-dioctadecyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide
(Br2PTCDI-C18) molecule on a low-cost glass substrate at
different channel lengths is reported, which is conceptually very
important and fundamental in the context of device performance. Anodized
alumina (Al2O3) along with dielectric films
of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was used
to fabricate the devices and study their influence on various transistor
properties. In addition, the effects of a thin hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS) layer on the performance of OFETs including their contact resistances
were studied with the channel length variations. The devices with
PVA dielectric material exhibited the maximum mobility values of 0.012–0.025
cm2 V–1 s–1 irrespective
of varying channel lengths from 25 to 190 μm. The bias-stress
measurements were recorded to realize the effects of the channel length
and HMDS layer on the stability of the devices. The on/off ratios
and electrical stabilities of these devices were enhanced significantly
by modifying the surface of the PVA dielectric layer using a thin
layer of HMDS. Similarly, in the case of PMMA dielectric layer, a drastic enhancement in
the on/off ratio and bias-stress stability was observed. Characterization
of all devices at different channel lengths using different dielectric
materials permitted us to identify the effects of contact resistance
on OFET devices. The stability of the devices in relation to the bias-stress
measurements of devices by varying channel lengths and surface modification
was systematically investigated. A careful analysis of oxide gate
dielectrics modified with polymer-based dielectric materials, contact
resistance, influence of thin HMDS layer on the electrical properties,
and other parameters on top-contact bottom-gated configured n-type
OFET devices is presented herein.

Introduction
In recent years, electronic
devices based on organic materials
have been receiving steady and increasing attention because of their
versatile applications in optoelectronics, biomedical electronics,
and digital electronics. Organic semiconducting materials are the
active components in electronic devices, including solar cells,1,2 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),3 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).4,5 For
a wide variety of low-cost, very large-area, flexible electronic applications,
OFETs are the fundamental components.6−8 Their relevance primarily
includes active-matrix displays,9 radio-frequency
identification tags,10 smart price and
inventory tags, smart cards, and large sensor arrays.11 OFETs offer two main advantages over inorganic semiconductor
field-effect transistors (FETs). The former can be fabricated at lower
temperatures, thereby lowering the cost significantly. Low-temperature
processing of OFETs allows them to be fabricated on low-cost plastic/polymer
substrates but not on glass and SiO2. Thus, the development
of unbreakable, flexible, very light-weight flat-panel displays has
found considerable commercial attention.

Despite the major improvements
accomplished in the performance
of OFETs over the past few years, several of these designs, materials,
and experimental parameters, which affect the OFET operation, are
yet to be understood clearly. Contact resistance remains as one such
parameter.12 Subsequently, the performance
of OFET typically experiences large contact resistances, which may
be limiting the speed of organic integrated circuits. In contrast
to the FETs developed by utilizing the polycrystalline, single-crystalline,
or hydrogenated amorphous silicon, the source and drain contacts of
OFETs rather may not be optimized easily by conventional methods,
such as doping the semiconductor or metal alloying. In OFETs, difference
in the energy between Fermi levels of the metal contacts and the HOMO
(highest occupied molecular orbital) or LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital) levels of the organic semiconductor (OSC) and the semiconductor
morphology decides the contact resistance value. The gate modulation
of the bulk resistivity in an OSC explains the obtained gate voltage
dependence of the contact resistance for various thicknesses of the
semiconducting thin films, and the contact resistance was Ohmic. However,
for thicker semiconducting films, significant asymmetry between the
source and drain contact resistances was observed with the drain resistances
increasing more rapidly with the thickness as compared with the source
resistance, revealing the vital role of diffusion at the drain contact.

The performance of n-type OSCs has been lagging behind the more
intensively examined p-type organic materials over the years.13,14 However, both kinds of semiconductors are vital to fabricate complementary
integrated circuits,15−17 bipolar transistors, or organic p/n junctions. Over
the past years, organic semiconducting materials appeared with high electron
mobilities compared with those of the amorphous silicon devices.18−20 In general, electron-deficient organic semiconducting materials
have been developed by introducing electron-withdrawing functionalities
at different substituent positions over the extended aromatic π-systems
with promising p-channel performance.21,22 Molecular
derivatives of perylenetetracarboxylic diimides (PTCDIs) are an exceptional
class of n-type OSC materials.23,24 PTCDIs have been studied
extensively because of their high molar absorptivity and higher quantum
yields with good photochemical and thermal stability. Additionally,
the self-assembly of π-conjugated materials directly from solution
provides a practical and potent approach to generate supramolecular
nanomorphological structures with long-range ordering, which remain
immensely important for the progress of organic optoelectronic devices.
PTCDIs or PDIs (perylene diimides) are, in general, very attractive
building blocks to self-assemble because the chemical functionalization
of the PDI core at their imide,25,26 ortho,27,28 or bay29 positions modifies their molecular
packing in films/solid state, resulting in exciting electronic and
optical properties. The solid-state molecular packing significantly
effects both the exciton migration and carrier mobility, which remain
central for optoelectronic devices, namely, OLEDs,30,31 FETs,32 and photovoltaics.33

To enhance the carrier injection into
OSC films, it is essential
to apply a higher voltage to the gate electrode or the gate insulator
of higher dielectric constant value.34 OFETs
with heavily doped conductive Si substrates were also reported by
using thermally oxidized SiO2 dielectrics.35 Even though SiO2 is confirmed to be a good insulator
with higher dielectric strength (∼10 MV/cm), SiO2 has a relatively lower dielectric constant (∼4). Therefore,
attempts to construct an OFET with a high-k and high-dielectric-constant
gate insulator to inject additional number of carriers have gained
momentum.36,37 An additional advantage of high-k dielectric materials is their ability to reduce the operating
voltage.38 In the present study, polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) and poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) were considered
to be polymer dielectric materials. The dielectric constants of PVA
and PMMA are ∼8 and 3, respectively. Therefore, injecting thrice
the amount of charge carriers into organic dielectric PVA than in
PMMA would be possible at the same thickness, and yet the best dielectric
breakdown behavior is actually realized. Hence, it remains crucial
to obtain a good polymer film with higher dielectric property and
smoother surface on the top of which a high-quality morphology OSC
thin film could be deposited.39

In
common practice, dielectric thin films are deposited by chemical
vapor deposition, sputtering, e-beam evaporation, and so forth. These
methods required costly equipment and are too sophisticated techniques
to grow a low-defect smooth dielectric thin film. In this work, we
attempted to fabricate an Al2O3 thin film by
anodization technique that seldom needs vacuum or elevated temperatures.40 Herein, uniform Al2O3 films
are grown on the Al layer. In this anodization process, the Al2O3 film growth takes place under “negative-feedback”
state, indicating higher electrochemical current flowing at defective
or thinner parts in the developing oxide film, in a way that these
defects get automatically restored. Herein, an attempt to develop
an Al2O3 surface on a thermally deposited Al
was discussed. Over the anodized Al2O3/Al gate
substrates, bottom gate-type OFETs using n-type N,N′-dioctadecyl-1,7-dibromo-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic
diimide (Br2PTCDI-C18) were fabricated with varying channel
lengths. It was clearly observed that these new OFETs worked exceedingly
well and showed consistent results, even on varying the length of
the channel. In this paper, the overall focus was to develop an economical
fabrication process and consistent device performance with the variation
in the channel length and the surface modification of the dielectric
layer, which has not been attempted previously.

Results and Discussion
The schematic diagram (Figure 1a) shows the OFETs prepared over anodized Al2O3, employed in this study with different dielectric materials
and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) surface-modifying layer. The OFETs
were fabricated using 13 nm thick anodized Al2O3/100 nm PVA, Al2O3/100 nm PVA/HMDS, Al2O3/100 nm PMMA, and Al2O3/100 nm PMMA/HMDS on a glass substrate. The structures of the semiconducting
material Br2PTCDI-C18 and HMDS are shown in Figure 1b,c. All four devices were
tested to identify the effect of the channel length on the performance
and stability of the OFET devices. A thin HMDS layer was also grown
to identify the effect of the HMDS layer on the growth of PVA or PMMA
surfaces. In general, anodized aluminum films have extremely high
rough surfaces (∼28 nm). To lessen this surface roughness,
a 100 nm PVA or PMMA film was spin-coated on these anodized surfaces.
The semiconductor films deposited on different dielectric materials
were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 2). The temperature and pressure
parameters were 50 °C and ∼10–6 mbar,
respectively, during deposition. On to these films, OSC films were
thermally deposited and characterized by AFM and X-ray diffraction
(XRD).

surfaces.

AFM and FESEM Analyses
The surface
features of Br2PTCDI-C18 thin films on diverse substrates
were characterized
using AFM (Figure 2). The growth of Br2PTCDI-C18 films on every HMDS-treated
substrate exhibited improved structural ordering and displayed grain
formation than the untreated films. However, the grain size and surface
roughness varied greatly at different surface energies. Figure 2a presents the topography image
of Br2PTCDI-C18 deposited over the PVA surface having a
root mean square (rms) roughness (σ) of 2.82 nm; whereas on
PMMA, the σ was 3.02 nm (Figure 2b) within the 1.5 × 1.5 μm2 scan
scale. On the HMDS-modified surface of PVA and PMMA, the σ was
found to be 3.47 and 3.22 nm, respectively (Figure 2c,d). It was observed that the grain size
increased when the dielectric surface was modified with HMDS because
of the increased hydrophobicity, which made the surface more favorable
for the organic molecule growth. In addition to the rms roughness
of all films interpreted from AFM (see Figure 2), the enhanced growth on HMDS-treated substrates
was further confirmed by XRD analysis and surface energy measurements.

Br2PTCDI-C18 OFETs were fabricated over different dielectric
materials with varying channel lengths and then characterized carefully
in their saturation regime, defined by the standard MOSFET models.
To further investigate the influence of different dielectric materials
(13 nm Al2O3/100 nm PVA and 13 nm Al2O3/100 nm PMMA) and HMDS treatment on the device performance,
the transistors having channel length L = 25, 50,
100, and 190 μm with a channel width of W =
750 μm were evaluated. The FESEM images of the different channel
lengths are shown in Figure 3a–d. Copper wires with different diameters were used
as masks to define the varying channel lengths.

electron microscopy (FESEM) images of different
channel lengths on the fabricated devices with the same channel width
of 750 μm and with channel lengths of (a) 25, (b) 50, (c) 100,
and (d) 190 μm.

XRD Analysis
XRD analysis was performed with Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.542 Å) to further confirm the morphological
changes identified in the AFM images and the structural changes. The
substrates for XRD analysis were prepared in the same manner as done
for the OFET device fabrication. In all four cases, a primary diffraction
peak at around 2θ = 2.62°–2.74° was observed.
In the case of PVA, the peak intensity is low and the fwhm (full width
half-maxima) is high among all, which indicated the formation of smaller
grain size, as observed in AFM. After modifying the surface of the
dielectric materials PVA and PMMA with HMDS, there was an increase
in the intensity and decrease in the fwhm (shown in Figure S1) of the low-angle diffraction peak observed in the
XRD spectra, as shown in Figure 4. The fwhm values extracted from the peaks and fitted
with Lorentzian function are tabulated in Table 1.

on different dielectric materials and after the surface modification

PMMA/HMDS	2.736	0.31903	
PMMA	2.730	0.5312	
PVA	2.622	0.6784	
The decrease in the fwhm of the diffraction peak after the modification
of the surface of PVA and PMMA is a clear signature of increase in
the grain size of the Br2PTCDI-C18, which is in well-agreement
with the results of the AFM analysis. Thus, by performing surface
modification of the dielectrics with HMDS, the film morphology is
improved, which enhanced the IDS correspondingly.

Surface Energy Measurements
To examine the surface
properties of dielectrics, the PVA and PMMA films were carefully characterized
by calculating the contact angle with deionized water and hexane having
varying polarities. Both contact angles and surface free energies
were recorded using a contact angle measurement system [KRUSS drop
shape analyzer (DSA 25E)] at 30 °C and ∼60% humidity.
The contact angle values and surface free energy for both PVA and
PMMA after various surface treatments are listed in Table 2. HMDS-treated surfaces (Table 2) showed smaller surface
free energy than unmodified surfaces. This decrease in the surface
energies after HMDS treatment indicated the improved morphology of
the Br2PTCDI-C18 grown thermally over the dielectric surfaces.
HMDS can form self-assembled layers on PVA and PMMA surfaces. Therefore,
HMDS treatments could exert good influence on increasing the crystallinity,
which results in the increase in the drain currents as well.

Devices Fabricated with
Al2O3/PVA
The output and transfer characteristic
curves of the OFET devices
fabricated using the Al2O3/PVA dielectric material
with different channel lengths are depicted in Figure 5. It was confirmed that the drain current
(IDS) decreased when the channel length
increases. At 25 μm channel length, the IDS at VDS = 10 V was 500 nA, which
further decreased to 380 nA at a channel length of 50 μm. It
further decreased up to 250 and 120 nA for 100 and 190 μm channel
lengths, respectively. The data were analyzed after plotting the square
root of IDS as a function of the gate
voltage (VGS). The slope of a fit to the
obtained linear portion of the obtained plot, above the threshold
value, provides the field-effect electron mobility (μ), whereas
intercept of the fit line on the x-axis provides
the threshold voltage (VTh) value. The
subthreshold slope is established by a linear fit to the log(IDS) just as the current begins to rise. The
on/off ratios were also calculated using the minimum current value
observed in the off region and the maximum current value observed
in the on region. The field-effect mobilities (μ) were obtained
from the slope of a plot of (IDS)1/2 against VGS, using the equation  where VTh and Cdiel are the threshold voltage and the capacitance
per unit area, respectively. The OFETs using Al2O3/PVA gate dielectrics exhibited a mobility of 0.012–0.025
cm2 V–1 s–1 for different
channel lengths. The threshold voltages were in the range of 0.23
to −3.12 V. The averaged transistor parameters of OFETs for
different channel lengths are summarized in Table 3. The μ value of the 25 μm channel
length device was 2 times lower than that of OFET with μ of
the 190 μm channel length prepared using the same dielectric
material.

The output and transfer characteristic curves (Figure 6) of the fabricated OFET devices
were obtained by modifying the surface of Al2O3/PVA dielectric material with the HMDS layer and varying the channel
lengths. It was observed that the drain current (IDS) decreased moderately compared with that of the unmodified
layer, as shown in Figure 5. At 25 μm channel length, the IDS at VDS = 10 V was 400 nA and
decreased up to 350 nA at a channel length of 50 μm. It further
decreased to 320 and 80 nA for 100 and 190 μm channel lengths,
respectively. The OFETs using Al2O3/PVA/HMDS
gate dielectrics exhibited high performance and high mobility value
in the range of 0.011–0.013 cm2 V–1 s–1 for different channel lengths. The threshold
voltages were observed to be on the order 0.15–2.25 V. In addition,
we observed an improvement in the threshold voltages and the subthreshold
slopes compared with those of the unmodified device. The “on/off
current ratios” also increased in these devices. The averaged
transistor parameters of OFETs for different channel lengths are shown
in Table 4.

Figure S2 presents the output and transfer
characteristic curves of the OFETs having Al2O3/PMMA dielectric material and Br2PTCDI-C18 as the dielectric
material at different channel lengths. Here also, it was observed
that the drain current (IDS) decreased
compared with that of the PVA dielectric-based devices; however, the
threshold voltages and other properties Ion/off ratios improved significantly. At 25 μm channel length, the IDS at VDS = 10 V
was 80 nA, which decreased to 70 nA when the channel length was 50
μm. It further decreased to 60 and 50 nA for 100 and 190 μm
channel lengths, respectively. The field-effect mobility was extracted
for all four transistors and was in the range of 0.0025–0.0045
cm2 V–1 s–1. All device
parameters are tabulated in Table S1.

Devices Fabricated with Al2O3/PMMA/HMDS
Figure S3 shows the output and transfer
curves of the OFETs having Al2O3/PMMA/HMDS dielectric
material and Br2PTCDI-C18 as the dielectric material at
different channel lengths. This resulted in an increase in the drain
current (IDS) compared with that of the
PMMA dielectric layer-based devices along with improvements in other
properties such as threshold voltage and Ion/off ratios. At 25 μm channel length, the IDS at VDS = 10 V was 120 nA, and
it decreased to 80 nA when the channel length was 50 μm. It
further decreased up to 50 and 20 nA for 100 and 190 μm channel
lengths, respectively. The field-effect mobility was extracted for
all four transistors and was in the range of 0.0015–0.0025
cm2 V–1 s–1. All device
parameters are tabulated in Table S2.

Effect of the Channel Length
Figure 7a shows the plots of the resistance versus
the channel length of these devices. All devices exhibited a linear
increase in the resistance with the channel length. The contact resistances
are extracted using the linear fitting of these curves by transmission
line method and are shown in the Table 5. The contact resistance changes with the morphology of
the OSC at the source/drain electrode and with the nature of the dielectric
material. As the number of charge traps in the OSC channel increased,
the contact resistance also increased (Figure 7b). With respect to the PVA dielectric, the
grain size of the deposited Br2PTCDI-C18 is less compared
with that of the one treated with HMDS. This resulted in the higher
density of grain boundaries at the electrode and OSC interface compared
with HMDS-treated devices, which caused high contact resistance. After
HMDS treatment, the contact resistance reduced because of the increase
in the grain size. Because of the hydrophobic nature of the PMMA dielectric,
the contact resistance is less than that in the case of PVA. After
modification with HMDS, the contact resistance further decreased similar
to that in the case of PVA dielectric. Under all above conditions,
the PMMA/HMDS showed very low contact resistance, 1.38 × 108 Ω. The contact resistance also depends on the vertical
overlap between gates with source–drain contacts. In this work,
the overlaps of the contacts are kept the same for all devices.

Bias-Stress and Stability Measurements
To further explore
and understand the electrical stability (under vacuum conditions)
of these devices, we recorded the bias-stress measurements on these
devices having different channel lengths. The devices were seen exhibiting
a decay behavior of IDS for 1 h of bias
stress under vacuum conditions, as shown in Figure 8a–d. As the channel length increases,
the increase in the decay of current is due to the more number of
charge traps present at the higher channel length. For 25 μm
channel length, in the case of Al2O3/PVA, the
decay in the current was about 45% (Figure 8a). When the surface of the dielectric is
modified by HMDS, the decay reduced to 30% (Figure 8b) in the case of Al2O3/PVA/HMDS. The additional decay is due to the hydrophilic nature
of PVA dielectric material. By contrast, for the devices fabricated
with PMMA, the decay in the current significantly reduced to 25% (Figure 8c), and upon the
surface modification of the dielectric with HMDS, it further decreased
to below 20% (Figure 8d). The same trends were observed for all devices fabricated with
different channel lengths. Thus, the devices fabricated on Al2O3/PMMA/HMDS with 25 μm channel length showed
better stability among all devices reported here.

Conclusions
In summary, it was observed that the OFETs
obtained utilizing oxide
gate dielectrics customized with the polymer dielectric materials
and thin layer of HMDS significantly improved the electrical behavior
as compared with the ones fabricated without the thin HMDS layer.
We were successful in demonstrating low-voltage operating Br2PTCDI-C18-based n-type OFETs with improved performance on low-cost
glass substrates and systematically studied the effect of the channel
length, dielectric material, and HMDS thin layer on the electrical
properties of the OFETs with enhanced stability at 25 up to 190 μm
channel lengths. In the process, the vital role of HMDS in combination
with gate dielectrics Al2O3/PVA and Al2O3/PMMA was successfully demonstrated. As the channel
length of the devices decreased, the IDS showed an increase. The devices fabricated on Al2O3/PVA showed better mobility, and Ion/off ratios and the stability of the device significantly increased by
HMDS modification even though there is a negligible change in the
mobility. The HMDS layer significantly improved the Ion/off ratios and the electrical stability of the device.
The electrical stabilities of the devices were tested by stressing
the device for 1 h at 10 V. However, the devices fabricated on Al2O3/PMMA/HMDS showed improved stability because
of the hydrophobic nature of PMMA.
