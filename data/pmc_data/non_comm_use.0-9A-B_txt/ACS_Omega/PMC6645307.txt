An
organic solid-state near-infrared (NIR)-emitter (λem = 738 nm) exhibiting large Stokes shift (Δλ
= 293 nm) through the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer
phenomenon has been synthesized and characterized. The present discovery
points to the possibility of achieving a new family of solid-state
NIR emitters starting from simple aldehyde and amine precursors.

1 Introduction
The
interest in near-infrared (NIR)-emitting molecules has increased
in recent years because of their potential applications in diverse
areas including bio-imaging,1,2 telecommunication,3 night-vision equipment,4 photodynamic therapy,5,6 sensing,7 and optoelectronics.8−11 However, the development of NIR-emitting organic molecules, especially,
solid-state NIR emitters, is a formidable challenge. A pre-requisite
for NIR emission is the low band gap, which is often achieved by incorporating
extended π-conjugation in the molecular design.2,8−10 However, such systems often tend to self-assemble
through weak-bonding interactions leading to aggregation-caused quenching
(ACQ) of fluorescence.9,11−13 Protection
of the NIR chromophore by bulky groups is a well-accepted strategy
for preventing the ACQ effect.9,11 In the literature,
there are only a limited group of compounds reported as NIR emitters,
which largely include certain organic dyes and their derivatives such
as cyanines,2 phthalocyanines,14 squarines,15 BODIPYs,16 rhodamines,17 porphyrinoids,18 as well as a number of donor–acceptor
chromophores1 and some rare-earth and transition
metal complexes.19,20 However, many of such compounds
require difficult and expensive synthetic procedures. Therefore, the
development of new classes of organic solid-state NIR emitters that
can be crafted easily from simple building blocks is of utmost relevance.
Of particular interest is the development of metal-free organic NIR
emitters in view of their special advantages in comparison to the
metal-based NIR emitters.

In recent years, solid-state emitters
based on excited-state intramolecular
proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon, which involves a proton shift
within the intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded sites, have emerged as
attractive materials for optoelectronics applications.8−10,21−24 Such proton transfer often causes
dramatic structural and electronic changes in the molecule leading
to unique fluorescence emission with a large Stokes shift.9 The most widely explored ESIPT fluorophores include
2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole, 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole
and 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole, some of which show NIR
emission in solution phase.2,22 Metal ion (Zn2+) binding-enabled ESIPT emission in the NIR region has been reported
in the bis(benzoxazole)-based system for bio-imaging applications.25

In this regard, we envisaged that a new
class of compartmental
Schiff bases with sufficiently extended π-conjugation could
be explored as NIR emitters, because such systems are known to exhibit
interesting luminescence properties as well as ESIPT.26 Moreover, Schiff bases allow facile synthesis from a variety
of readily available aldehyde and amine precursors, permitting easy
structural and electronic fine-tuning. Herein, we propose a generalized
Schiff base moiety 1, Figure 1 (inset), capable of exhibiting the ESIPT
phenomenon as a potential NIR emitter, whose π-conjugation could
be fine-tuned by varying substitutions at R1, R2, and R3 positions. To test our hypothesis, we have developed
the first example of 1, 1AA, by coupling
2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzene-1,3-dialdehyde (dfp) with
two units of 4-(methylthio)aniline (4-mta) as shown in Figure 1. Using 1AA, we
could achieve solid-state NIR emission as hypothesized, the details
of which are being reported in this paper.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Design and Synthesis
The Schiff base 1AA was synthesized by the condensation of dfp and 4-mta
in 1:2 molar ratio in ethanol; see Experimental
Section and Supporting Information for more details. The molecular structure of 1AA was
confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, see Figure 1b and Table S1, which unambiguously showed that 1AA consists
of two units of 4-mta linked through two imine (−C=N−)
bonds to the dfp unit resulting in an extended π-conjugated
system as expected. The asymmetric unit consists of two molecules
of 1AA as shown in Figure 1b, and these molecules show small variations in their
structural features. In 1AA, the imine N of one of the
two 4-mta arms (say D1-arm) is involved in intramolecular
hydrogen bonding (IHB) interaction with the phenolic −OH group.
The IHB interaction in 1AA was confirmed by 1H NMR. The 1H NMR signal of the phenolic proton of 1AA was observed at 13.53 ppm in CDCl3, which gets
shifted to 13.84 ppm in DMSO-d6 (see Figure
S4, Supporting Information). This indicates
that 1AA exists predominantly in enol form in solution.21 The hydrogen bond acidity (A) for 1AA is quantified by using eq 1 1  where Δδ = δ(DMSO) –
δ(CDCl3). The value of A obtained,
that is, 0.047 (<0.1), establishes a strong IHB interaction in 1AA in solution.27 Furthermore,
the completely symmetric 1H NMR spectra confirmed the existence
of fast proton transfer in 1AA, which is an essential
requirement of ESIPT.21,28

2.2 Photophysical
Properties
1AA exhibited two characteristic
absorption peaks at 345 and 407 nm
(molar absorptivity at λmax, ε1AA = 1.7 × 104 M–1 cm–1, Figure S12) in dichloromethane (DCM)
solution due to π → π* and n → π*
transitions, respectively, and showed fluorescence emission at λem = 645 nm (λex = 407 nm) with a photoluminescence
quantum yield (PLQY; ϕ) of 2.0%, Figure 2 and Table 1. Furthermore, the photophysical studies performed
in the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) matrix showed that 1AA exhibits almost similar absorption and emission properties as that
observed in DCM solutions, but with a higher PLQY (ϕ = 4.0%), Figure 2 and Table 1.

(b) DCM containing 1AA (10.0 μM) under UV light
(365 nm). The rest mass of 1AA in PMMA matrix was chosen
so as to give an absorbance less than 0.1 at the excitation wavelength.

Often, Schiff bases exhibit photo-induced electron
transfer (PET)
in solutions, which adversely affects their fluorescence properties.29,301AA exhibits strong IHB interaction between the phenolic
−OH and imine N of one of the 4-mta arms (D1-arm)
enabling ESIPT phenomenon, which prevents PET in this arm. However,
in the non-hydrogen-bonded arm (D2-arm), PET can still
be active and that helps to transfer the electron density from D2 to D1-arm in the excited state,31 see Scheme 1. Recently, Thiel et al. reported that certain aromatic Schiff bases
can undergo fast ESIPT and the keto tautomer thus generated is responsible
for the fluorescence emission.32 In 1AA, fluorescence emission at 645 nm with a large Stoke shift
(Δλ = 238 nm) indicates the occurrence of ESIPT leading
to keto tautomer, Scheme 1.

Structures
Contributing to the Stabilization of the NH Form
Fluorescence studies on 1AA were
also conducted in
different solvents such as hexane, DCM, acetonitrile (ACN), dimethylformamide
(DMF), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) having different hydrogen bond
acceptor ability (β). This is because the hydrogen bonding abilities
of solvents are shown to affect the photophysical properties of molecules
exhibiting excited-state proton transfer.331AA exhibited red-shifted emission at 670 nm in hexane
(β = 0.0)33 with a very low quantum
yield, ϕ = ∼0.9%. However, in DMSO (β = 0.76), 1AA exhibited emission at ∼600 nm (blue-shifted) with
a quantum yield ϕ = ∼5%, Figure S13 and Table 2. It is
also noticed that 1AA exhibits two emission peaks, a
lower wavelength emission at ∼460 nm assigned to the normal
charge transfer species and a highly Stokes shifted band at ∼645
nm assigned to the proton transferred tautomer species of 1AA (Figure S13).

Furthermore, the fluorescence
emissions were measured after sequential
additions of acetic acid (AcOH) and triethylamine (TEA) to DCM solutions
of 1AA in order to confirm the existence of ESIPT. 1AA was nearly nonfluorescent upon addition of TEA, probably
because of the deprotonation of the phenolic proton preventing ESIPT,
see Figure 3 and Scheme S1. Interestingly, 1AA became
highly fluorescent (ϕ = ∼12%) upon addition of AcOH,
probably because of the generation of N-protonated imine in DCM solution
(Scheme S1). This observation further illustrated
that the emission of 1AA was controlled by ESIPT and
is in agreement with the previous reports of increased fluorescence
in acidic medium in similar types of ESIPT fluorophores.2 The reversible modulation of emission intensity
between the N-protonated imine and deprotonated phenolic moieties
(Scheme S1) by alternate additions of AcOH
and TEA is shown in Figure S14. No molecular
degradation was observed for at least five such cycles.

2.3 Photophysical Properties of 1AA in the Solid State
Considering the importance of solid-state
NIR emitters, we were interested in investigating the photophysical
properties of 1AA in the solid state as well. The absorption
and emission spectra of 1AA in the solid state (powder
form) revealed a broad absorption band in 300–450 nm range
and an NIR emission band at 738 nm (λex = 445 nm)
with a very large Stokes shift (Δλ ≈ 293 nm) and
a PLQY of ∼9% (Figure 4 and Table 1). The relatively high quantum yield of 1AA in the solid
state in comparison to that in solution is probably due to the inhibition
of the ultrafast excited-state deactivation channels in the rigid
medium.32 The difference in emission wavelength
of 1AA in solution or PMMA matrix in comparison to the
solid state may be attributed to the luminescence characteristics
of isolated molecules.9,11−13 However, the
absorption tails of 1AA in powder form and the PMMA matrix
may indicate the existence of IHB interactions in rigid medium responsible
for the photo-induced keto–enol tautomerism through ESIPT.9

UV light.

2.4 Crystal
Structure Analysis
To understand
the reasons behind the fluorescence properties exhibited by 1AA in the solid state, we analyzed its crystal structure
in detail. The dihedral angles between the planes of the salicylaldimine
ring of dfp and the aromatic ring of D1-arm
(H-bonded arm) are 20.5° and 25.3°, respectively, for the
two molecules present in the asymmetric unit of 1AA,
while the similar angles for D2-arms were 39.7° and
46.4°, respectively, Figure 5a. In the crystal of 1AA, the molecules
are stacked along the a axis, see Figure 5c. In this stacking arrangement,
the salicylaldimine phenolic units face each other in a slipped configuration
with a centroid to centroid distances of 4.877 and 5.168 Å, Figure 5b. It can be seen
from the stacking diagram that the aromatic ring of the D1-arms (H-bonded arm) on the adjacent molecules are packed in a parallel
fashion with the −SCH3 units on alternate molecules
pointing to the opposite directions, Figure 5b. However, the aromatic rings of the D2-arms (non-H-bonded arm) on the adjacent molecules are arranged
in an almost perpendicular fashion. Such an arrangement leads to large
interplanar separation in 1AA. The large interplanar
separations together with the slipped configuration of the stacking
of the adjacent molecules prevent any π–π stacking
interaction among the molecules in the crystal lattice. The two independent
molecules present in the asymmetric unit of 1AA are involved
in extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction with the
neighboring molecules leading to the formation of chain-like structures,
see Figures 5d, S15, and Table 3. The molecular packing diagrams of 1AA along a, b, and c axes are shown in Figure S16. Earlier
studies on organic solids have shown that the fluorescence emission
properties can be optimized by regulating their molecular packing
and intermolecular noncovalent interactions. It has been shown that
the prevention of π–π stacking interactions among
the molecules in the crystal helps to reduce the ACQ effect in organic
fluorophores.9,11−13 Similarly,
the suppression of the molecular vibrations that can lead to nonradiative
transitions through H-bonding interactions is another useful strategy
employed in organic solid-state emitters. In 1AA, the
π–π stacking interactions are absent because of
the slipped arrangement of adjacent molecules as well as due to the
large interplanar distance (Figure 5d).

in the asymmetric unit showing the dihedral angles; (b) stacking of 1AA molecules in the crystal showing a slipped configuration
with large interplanar distance; (c) crystal packing diagram of 1AA showing stacking of molecules along a axis; and (d) interconnection of adjacent molecular chain through
hydrogen bonding interaction.

Moreover, multiple hydrogen bonding
interactions exhibited by 1AA molecules help to minimize
molecular vibrations and accompanied
nonradiative transitions. We believe that the unique intermolecular
interactions and the crystal packing features exhibited by 1AA permit its NIR emission through the ESIPT process in the solid state.
Similar cases have already been reported in the literature.9 For example, different alkoxy substituted (−OMe,
−OEt, −OPr, and −OBt) derivatives of the ESIPT
fluorophore, 2,6-bis(benzothiazol-2-yl)phenol, are reported to exhibit
red- and blue-shifted fluorescence emission in the solid state compared
to their emissions in the solution phase because of the differences
in the intermolecular interactions in the crystalline forms.9

2.5 Theoretical and Electrochemical
Studies
To understand the electronic structures and the enol
(E)–keto
(K) tautomerization in 1AA, we performed density functional
theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations with the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
basis set using a suite of Gaussian 09 program.34 The optimized structures with the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
energy levels of 1AA in enol and keto forms are shown
in Figure 6. In the
enol form, the D1-arm of 1AA is not coplanar
with the central phenol ring in S0 state, whereas it is
coplanar with the phenol ring in S1 state, see Supporting Information Figure S17. Meanwhile,
in the keto form, the D1-arm of 1AA is almost
coplanar with the phenol ring in both the S0 and S1 states, see Supporting Information Figure S17 and Table S2. This twisting of the D1-arm
from the noncoplanar to the coplanar state attributes to the proton
transfer in the ESIPT process. Moreover, in the enol form, the O–H
bond length increases from 0.99670 Å in the S0 state
to 1.68887 Å in the S1 state, along with a decrease
in the N···H distance from 1.70389 Å (S0 state) to 1.04640 Å (S1 state). However in the keto
form, the changes in these bond lengths on excitation are not pronounced,
see Table S3. This shows a strengthening
of the hydrogen bonding interactions in the excited state, contributing
to the ESIPT phenomenon.35 We calculated
the absorption maximum for the enol form of 1AA as λabs = 400 nm, see Supporting Information Figure S18, which is closely matched with the experimental value
(λabs = 407 nm); however, the absorption of the keto
form of 1AA (λabs = 595 nm) was red-shifted
drastically by ∼195 nm to the longer wavelength, see Supporting Information Figure S18.

Figure 6 Schematic representation
of ESIPT photocycle showing the comparison
of HOMO–LUMO levels between enol and keto forms of 1AA.

Upon excitation of 1AA existing in the enol form,
the π-electron density located on the phenol ring and the D2-arm gets transferred to the phenol ring, the imine linker,
and the D1-arm. As a result of the ESIPT process, there
is a decrease in the energy of the LUMO levels from −2.65 eV
(enol form of 1AA) to −2.74 eV (keto form of 1AA). The difference in the LUMO energy levels of the enol
and keto forms of 1AA is 0.09 eV. Similarly, the theoretically
calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the keto form of 1AA (−5.18 eV and −2.74 eV) are in agreement with the
experimentally calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 1AA (−5.21 eV and −2.59 eV) by cyclic voltammetry, see Figure S19 and Table S4.

The thermal stability of 1AA was analyzed by
thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), which revealed a decomposition temperature (Td) of 306 °C. Such a high Td value suggests the suitability of 1AA for
potential optoelectronics device applications, see Figure S20.

2.6 Studies Using Control Compounds
In
order to confirm the roles of ESIPT and the extended π-conjugation
in 1AA in determining its deep red and NIR emitting behaviors
in different environments, we synthesized and studied two control
compounds 1A and 1B as shown in Figure 7. 1A has only one 4-mta unit and therefore less π-conjugation compared
to 1AA. In 1B, the phenolic −OH is
replaced by the −OEt group, preventing the possibility of ESIPT.
The details of the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical
studies of 1A and 1B are given in Supporting Information. The molecular structures
of 1A and 1B were confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray crystallography, see Figure 7.

Figure 7 ORTEP diagram (50% probability level) of 1A (left)
and 1B (right). Color code: N—blue, O—red,
C—gray, S—yellow, and H—black.

1A showed an electronic absorption
peak at 380 nm
(ε = 1.8 × 104 M–1 cm–1) and a weak fluorescence emission in DCM solution
at 426 nm (less intense) and 593 nm (more intense) (λex = 380 nm, ϕ = 0.03%, Δλ = 213 nm) (Figure S21) due to keto tautomer induced by ESIPT.
Similar photophysical properties of 1A were also observed
in the PMMA matrix (λem = 594 nm, λex = 380 nm, ϕ = 0.89%, Δλ = 214 nm). In the solid
(powdered) state, 1A exhibited fluorescence emission
at 604 nm (λex = 420 nm, ϕ = 15% and Δλ
= 184 nm) with high quantum yield, red-shifted by ∼10 nm in
comparison to the solution state, Figure 8. Crystal data demonstrated no π–π
stacking in 1A, which helps to reduce ACQ. The angle
between the planes of the phenol ring and the 4-mta arm is 2.29°,
making almost a planar structure for 1A promoting the
ESIPT phenomenon, see Supporting Information Figure S22, Table S5, and Scheme S2. The results clearly indicate
that the inclusion of the extra arm of 4-mta has a significant impact
on the fluorescence of 1AA by improving its Stokes shift.

Figure 8 (a) UV–vis
DRS (black line) and fluorescence emission spectra
(blue line) of 1A in powder form; (b) solid-state image
of 1A under visible light; and (c) solid-state image
of 1A under UV light (365 nm).

On the other hand, compound 1B showed absorption
peak
at 375 nm, which is blue-shifted compared to that of 1AA (λabs = 407 nm) in DCM. However, compound 1B showed very weak or negligible fluorescence emission at
434 nm with only a small Stokes shift (59 nm) in DCM and no emission
in the solid state, see Supporting Information Figures S23 and S24. This behavior is probably due to the absence
of the phenolic hydrogen in 1B required for ESIPT. Also,
the simple change of the replacement of phenolic −OH with −OEt
group led to a totally different crystal packing arrangement in 1B compared to that of 1AA with different dihedral
angles of rotations of D1 and D2-arms as shown
in Figure 9a. Moreover,
in the packing mode, the central aromatic rings face each other in
a centro-symmetric manner with a centroid-to centroid distance of
3.63 Å, Figure 9b. This perhaps leads to π–π stacking interactions
in 1B in solid state affecting its fluorescence properties
adversely. Studies on these control compounds therefore confirm the
roles of extended conjugation and ESIPT phenomenon in 1AA in determining its fluorescence properties in solution, PMMA and
solid states.

angles; and (b) stacking of the two molecules of 1B in

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
reported the first example, 1AA, of a potentially new
class of organic solid-state NIR emitters
crafted through simple Schiff base condensation. In DCM solution, 1AA exhibited deep red emission and the occurrence of ESIPT
in solution phase was confirmed by large Stokes shift values and NMR
studies. In powder form, 1AA emitted in the NIR region,
again with a large Stokes shift due to ESIPT phenomenon. Crystallographic
analyses of 1AA revealed large interplanar spacing and
no π–π stacking interactions among the molecules
in the crystal structure, which help to prevent ACQ of fluorescence.
Similarly, the multiple H-bonding interactions exhibited by 1AA help to suppress the molecular vibrations that can induce
nonradiative transitions. Theoretically calculated HOMO–LUMO
energy levels and energy gap values for 1AA assuming
ESIPT phenomenon were matched with the experimental values calculated
through photophysical and electrochemical analyses. 1AA exhibited high thermal stability and the cyclic voltammetric studies
revealed its potential for optoelectronics device applications. Studies
using control compounds confirmed the roles of ESIPT and extended
π-conjugation in the observed NIR emission by 1AA. Currently, we are engaged in the development of more examples of
NIR emitters belonging to this series of compounds by systematically
varying substitutions R1, R2, and R3 on the moiety 1.

An ethanolic solution of 2-hydroxy-5-methoxy benzaldehyde (mfp) (4.0 mmol, 0.61 g, 1.0 equiv) was added slowly into ethanolic
solution of 4-(methylthio)aniline (4-mta) (4.0 mmol,
0.56 g, 1.0 equiv), and the resulting solution was stirred at room
temperature for 3–6 h. On completion of the reaction, a precipitate
was formed which was filtered and washed with cold ethanol and dried
under vacuum to obtain the pure orange colored Schiff base (1A). After recrystallization from the methanol–chloroform
(2:1, v/v) solvent mixture, orange crystals of 1A were
obtained in 80% yield (0.87 g). IR (ATR, cm–1):
1614 (C=N). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3 300
K): δ (ppm) 12.79 (s, 1H, ArOH), 8.58 (s, 1H, HC=N),
7.30 (d, 2H, J = 8.9 Hz, ArH), 7.24 (d, 2H, J = 8.9 Hz, ArH), 6.98 (m, 2H, ArH), 6.89 (d, 1H, J = 2.7 Hz, ArH), 3.80 (s, 3H, −OCH3),
2.5 (s, 3H, −SCH3). 13C NMR (125 MHz,
CDCl3 300 K): δ 161.4, 155.3, 152.2, 145.5, 137.3,
127.4, 121.6, 120.3, 118.7, 118.0, 115.1, 55.9 and 16.0 ppm. ESI–MS: m/z 274.04 [1A + H]+ (calcd 274.05).

4.7.2 Synthesis of 2,6-Bis((E)-(4-(methylthio)phenylimino)methyl)-4-methoxyphenol, C23H22N2O2S2 (1AA)
Ethanolic solution (5.0 mL) of dfp(44) (3.0 mmol, 0.54 g, 1.0 equiv) (heated
at 60
°C, until a clear yellow solution of dfp was obtained)
was added slowly into 10.0 mL ethanolic solution of 4-(methylthio)aniline
(4-mta) (6.0 mmol, 0.83 g, 2.0 equiv) under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Subsequently, a catalytic amount of acetic acid was added,
and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux with stirring overnight.
The product precipitated from the solution upon cooling to room temperature
and was filtered off and washed with cold ethanol and dried under
vacuum to yield pure compartmental Schiff base 1AA. After
recrystallization from the methanol–chloroform (2:1, v/v) solvent
mixture, golden yellow crystals of 1AA were obtained
in 79% (1.0 g) yield. IR (ATR, cm–1): 1615 (C=N). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz, 300 K): δ (ppm) 13.53
(s, 1H, ArOH), 8.82 (br, 2H, HC=N), 7.30 (d, 5H, J = 8.9 Hz, ArH), 7.25 (d, 5H, J = 8.9 Hz, ArH),
3.87 (s, 3H, −OCH3), 2.50 (s, 6H, −SCH3). 13C NMR (125 MHz, DMSO-d6 300 K): δ 157.9, 155.3, 151.6, 146.2, 136.8, 126.8,
122.0, 121.9, 117.9, 55.7, 14.8. ESI–MS: m/z 423.12 [1AA + H]+ (calcd
423.11).

4.7.3 Synthesis of 2-Ethoxy-5-methoxybenzene-1,3-dialdehyde,
C11H12O4(dfp-OEt)
To a suspension of dfp (0.5 mmol, 0.090 g, 1.0 equiv)
and potassium carbonate (0.75 mmol, 0.104 g, 1.5 equiv) in 8 mL dry
DMF, bromoethane (0.75 mmol, 0.056 g, 1.5 equiv) was added and heated
at 60-70 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction
mixture was added to ice cold water, and the precipitate was filtered
off and washed with cold water to give a white colored solid in 71%
(0.074 g) yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz, 300
K): δ (ppm) 10.37 (s, 2H, HC=O), 7.61 (s, 2H, ArH), 4.14
(q, 2H, J = 6.9 Hz, −OCH2), 3.80
(s, 3H, −OCH3), 1.40 (t, 3H, J =
6.9 Hz, −CH3). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3 300 K): δ 188.4, 158.2, 156.1, 131.0, 119.1, 56.0,
15.1. ESI–MS: m/z 209.06
[(dfp-OEt) + H]+ (calcd 209.07).

4.7.4 Synthesis of (11E)-N-(3-((E)-(4-(Methylthio)phenylimino)methyl)-2-ethoxy-5-methoxybenzylidene)-4-(methylthio)benzenamine,
C25H26N2O2S2(1B)
An ethanolic solution of dfp-OEt (0.480 mmol, 0.100 g, 1.0 equiv) was added slowly into ethanolic
solution of 4-(methylthio)aniline (4-mta) (0.96 mmol, 0.133 g, 2.0
equiv), and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature
for 6 h. On completion of the reaction, a precipitate was formed,
which was filtered and washed with cold ethanol and dried under vacuum
to obtain the pure yellowish colored Schiff base 1B.
After recrystallization from the methanol–chloroform (2:1,
v/v) solvent mixture, golden yellow crystals of 1B were
obtained in 83% (0.180 g) yield. IR (ATR, cm–1):
