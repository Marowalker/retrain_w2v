Introduction
The development of
more selective and potent pharmaceuticals is
one of the most important missions of current organic chemistry. While
the process of drug discovery is rather a complicated, multifaceted
endeavor, careful structural analysis of the newly approved pharmaceuticals
can reveal some essential trends in the successful formulations. For
example, introduction of fluorinated groups into a drug candidate
molecule usually leads to greater metabolic stability, activity, and
overall favorable pharmacokinetics.1 Another
general trend is the incorporation of tailor-made amino acid (AA)2 moieties allowing for more precise mimicking
of peptide–receptor interactions as well as lowering the toxicity
and undesirable side effects.3 Consequently,
from the structural standpoint, fluorine-containing α-4 and β-AAs,5 featuring
both essential traits, are considered to have pronounced pharmaceutical
potential in the modern drug design.6 Chemistry
of fluorine-containing AAs and peptides, including synthesis and biological
studies, published before 1994, is covered by a comprehensive monograph.7 Since then, this research field has grown tremendously,
being updated by more specialized review articles4,5 and
recent publications.6

Among various
types of fluorinated tailor-made AAs, linear ω-CF3-AAs represent a family of structurally relatively simple,
yet very useful compounds widely used in drug development and peptide
research.8 In particular, (S)-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic acid (1) (Figure 1), a fluorinated
analogue naturally occurring in bacterial proteins norvaline (2),9 has been extensively used
in the design of bioactive formulations10 and protein research.11 Quite remarkably,
the residue of AA 1 played a key role in the development
of avagacestat 3, a γ-secretase inhibitor used
in the treatment of Alzheimer disease.12 As a part of our current activity focused on the large-scale synthesis
of a potential pharmaceutical agent, we needed a reliable access to
multigram quantities of enantiomerically pure 2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic
acid 1 derivatives.

Figure 1 2-Amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic acid
(1), its naturally
occurring parent AA norvaline (2), and a γ-secretase
inhibitor avagacestat (3).

A careful analysis of the literature data available for the
preparation
of the target AA 1(13) evidently
indicated that the known approaches are not viable for the large-scale
synthesis, prompting us to undertake an appropriate research project.
For example, the most operationally convenient and scalable enzymatic
resolution approach13e produces equal amount
of unwanted enantiomer, which would be problematic for the large-scale
preparation of only the target enantiomer. On the other hand, the
purely chemical approaches for the asymmetric synthesis of AA 1,13d,13f,13j while efficient on a small scale, involve chromatographic purifications
and strictly controlled reaction conditions, which would be quite
problematic for a large-scale process. In this work, we examine two
alternative approaches to synthesize AA 1, including
alkylation of a chiral glycine equivalent vs. dynamic kinetic resolution
(DKR) of the corresponding racemate. We disclose that the latter approach
is significantly more practical, allowing convenient and reliable
preparation of the target (S)-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic
acid (1) derivatives on over 20 g scale. The obvious
synthetic value of the procedure developed in the present work is
that it does not require any special conditions or chromatographic
purifications and can be recommended as a method of choice for low-cost,
large-scale synthesis.

Results and Discussion
Consistent
with our continuous interest in asymmetric synthesis
of various types of tailor-made fluorine-,14 phosphorus-containing,15 sterically constrained16 AAs, as well as self-disproportionation of enantiomers17 of AA derivatives, we are actively developing
chemistry of Ni(II) complexes derived from AA Schiff bases3e,18 as a general method for the preparation of tailor-made AAs. Using
the modular approach for designing chiral tridentate ligands,19 recently, we introduced strategically tri-chlorosubstituted
ligands (R)- and (S)-4 (Scheme 1)20 possessing the optimized stereocontrolling properties.21

Scheme 1 Applications of Tridentate Ligand (S)-4 for General Asymmetric Synthesis of α-AAs
Scheme 1(A) shows
the preparation of nucleophilic glycine equivalent (S,S)-6. Scheme 1(B) gives the alkylation of glycine complex
(S)-5. Scheme 1(C) shows the dynamic kinetic resolution
of unprotected AAs.

In most of the applications, ligands 4 are first converted
to glycine Ni(II) complexes of type 5, followed by the
alkylation of the methylene moiety.22 A
methodologically different approach involves a direct reaction of
ligands 4 with racemic AAs, resulting in dynamic kinetic
resolution, including (S)/(R)-interconversion,23 and formation of major products 6 of (S,S) absolute configuration.24 Subsequently, application of (R)-configured ligands 4 gives rise to 6-(R,R) products, assuming a regular case
of CIP priority. It is interesting to note that the dynamic kinetic
resolution approach can also be successfully applied for β-AAs.25 Considering that both approaches can be used
for the preparation of the target (S)-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic
acid (1) derivatives, we decided to examine each of them
to find the most practical solution.

Alkylation Approach
Drawing from our recent experience
with the alkylation of glycine complex (S)-5 using CF3-containing alkyl halides,6s−6u we decided to use N,N-dimethyl-formamide
(DMF) as a solvent and NaOH as a base for the reaction with 1,1,1-trifluoro-3-iodopropane,
as presented in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Alkylation of Chiral Glycine Equivalent (S)-5
Analysis of the reaction mixture by thin-layer chromatography
and
high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of several
byproducts including minor diastereomer (S)(2R)-7, bis-alkylated complex (S)-8, and 4-phenylquinazoline (S)-9, typical for this reactions.6s,6t As was previously
shown,26 compound (S)-9 is the end product of the reaction of complexes of types 5 and 7 with atmospheric oxygen, leading to the
cleavage of the N–C bond, followed by the cyclization involving
the proline carbonyl. It should be noted that first attempts to use
the conditions optimized for alkylations of (S)-5 with CF3–CH2–I and CF3–(CH2)3–I6s,6t were rather unsuccessful. Most likely, the application of a base
in homogeneous form like NaOMe, solutions, or ground to powder NaOH
led to noticeable decomposition of the alkylation reagent due to the
favorable formation of CF3–CH=CH2. Also, in this case, the application of commercial-grade DMF gave
unexpectedly higher amounts of oxidation product (S)-9. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain the undesired
reactivity and byproduct formation by using NaOH beads and highly
controlled conditions such as dry and deoxygenated DMF. In fact, on
the 1 g scale, under these conditions, we obtained rather good chemical
yield and diastereoselectivity. Thus, the major diastereomer (S,S)-7 was isolated with 98.4%
yield and of 84.0% de. Attempts to scale up this procedure were much
successful, however. Likely, a problematic homogenization of the reaction
mixture, increased decomposition of the alkylating reagent, and difficulties
associated with handling larger amounts of solvent and the reagents
resulted in deteriorated chemical yields and stereochemical outcome.

Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Approach
In general, dynamic
kinetic resolution (DKR) of unprotected α- and β-AAs using
ligands of type (S)-4 is almost ideal
methodology for practical large-scale preparation of enantiomerically
pure tailor-made AAs.23−25 Nevertheless, one particular limitation of this approach
is the availability of starting racemic AA. In our case, the racemic
2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic acid is quite inexpensive and commercially
available as N-acetyl derivative 10 (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Preparation of Racemic
2-Amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic Acid Hydrochloride 11
After a series of experiments,
using various conditions to perform
a cleavage of the amide bond in 10, we finally chose
6 N aqueous hydrochloric acid. Thus, heating of amide 10 with 6 N HCl at 100 °C for 4 h led to the desired hydrolysis
with quantitative chemical yield. Purification of hydrochloric salt 11 was achieved simply by washing of the crude product and
filtration of chemically pure compound 11, isolated with
88.8% yield.

In contrast to the alkylation procedure, DKR is
usually conducted
in an alcohol solvent and the process is not complicated by oxidative
reactions, leading to the byproducts of type (S)-9. Accordingly, DKR can be conducted under convenient, not-so-strictly
controlled conditions, even in open air, showing a great potential
for large-scale synthesis.23−25 As presented in Scheme 4, tridentate ligand (S)-4, used as a hydrochloric salt, was reacted
with hydrochloride of 2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic acid 11 in methanol in the presence of a base and source of Ni(II)
ions to furnish the target product (S,S)-7.

Scheme 4 Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Unprotected
2-Amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic
Acid Hydrochloride 11
After a series of reactions conducted to optimize the
reaction
conditions, it was determined that K2CO3 and
NiCl2 were the best-performing base and Ni(II) source,
respectively. Of particular importance was the optimization of stoichiometric
ratios between all of the reagents. Thus, considering the fact that
ligand (S)-4 is more expensive than
racemate 11, we used the latter in excess, calculating
the chemical yield based on ligand (S)-4. The best yield of the product (S,S)-7 (97.0%) was obtained with the application of 1.4
equiv excess of rac-11 and NiCl2, using 7 equiv of the base. Relatively large excess of K2CO3 (7 equiv) was needed due to the necessity to
neutralize 2 equiv of HCl, transforming both starting ligand (S)-4 and AA rac-11 to a free base and zwitterion, respectively. Most importantly, under
these conditions, product (S,S)-7 was obtained in a virtually diastereomerically pure form
(99.5% de). This aspect of the developed process is of utmost synthetic
value, as no other additional purification is required to proceed
to the next disassembly stage (vide infra). Furthermore, the isolation
of (S,S)-7 was achieved
simply by filtration of the precipitate formed after pouring of the
reaction mixture into aqueous acetic acid. Moreover, we also examined
the reproducibility of this method for small- as well as larger-scale
reactions. For example, using 16.6 g of ligand (S)-4, we prepared 38.7 g of (S,S)-7 (97% yield, 99.5% de).

The next
synthetic step, the disassembly of this prepared product
(S,S)-7, is presented
in Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 Disassembly
of Diastereomer (S,S)-7; Isolation of Free Zwitterionic AA (S)-1; and Recycling of Ligand (S)-4
As stated above, product (S,S)-7 obtained by the DKR
procedure, without any additional
purification, was subjected to the disassembly procedure under the
action of 3 N HCl in methanol (50 °C for 5 h). Upon disappearance
of a typical red–orange color of the Ni(II) complex (S,S)-7, the reaction mixture
was allowed to gradually cool down to ambient temperature, resulting
in the formation of a precipitate of the hydrochloric salt of ligand
(S)-4. The precipitate was filtered
off, allowing for a convenient recycling (∼90%) of the stereochemically
intact chiral ligand (S)-4, which can
be reused for the preparation of new batches of AA (S)-1 or other synthetic applications. The target AA (S)-1 was isolated with over 98% yield using
a rather standard procedure with cation-exchange resin and 9% ammonium
hydroxide as an eluent.

While the isolation of free zwitterionic
AA (S)-1 was conceptually important
to demonstrate the conventional
preparative value of this method, for our development purposes, we
needed an access to AA (S)-1 in a form
suitable for peptide synthesis. To this goal, we performed a modified
disassembly procedure as presented in Scheme 6.

Scheme 6 Disassembly of Diastereomer (S,S)-7; Isolation of Fmoc-AA (S)-12; and Recycling of Ligand (S)-4
First, instead of methanol, we used dimethoxyethane (DME),
which
improved the solubility of complex (S,S)-7, leading to overall smaller volumes of solvents
and a bit greater disassembly rate. The recycling of chiral ligand
(S)-4 was achieved by filtration, quite
similar to the procedure discussed above (Scheme 5). The solution of AA (S)-1 with NiCl2 was first treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) to chelate the Ni(II) ions, followed by the standard reaction
using the Fmoc-OSu reagent under basic conditions. The target Fmoc-derivative
(S)-12 was isolated with excellent chemical
yield (93.3%) and acceptable enantiomeric purity (98.2% ee).

Finally, it should be noted that the described DKR procedures were
also applied for the preparation of (R)-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic
acid 1 and its Fmoc-derivative 12 using
(R)-configured chiral ligand 4.

Conclusions
In this work, we examined two alternative approaches for the preparation
of (S)-2-amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanoic acid and
its Fmoc-derivative. We found that while the alkylation procedure
can be successfully performed on an ∼1 g scale, the dynamic
kinetic resolution is generally a more practical solution for scaled
up (∼20 g) synthesis. The operational convenience of all chemical
transformations coupled with excellent chemical yields and diastereoselectivity,
as well as the recycling of the chiral ligand, bodes well for the
widespread application of this method.

The Ni–Glycine complex
(S)-5 (1.0 g, 1.66 mmol) and 1,1,1-trifluoro-3-iodopropane
(0.21 mL, 1.83 mmol) were stirred in deoxygenated N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF) (10 mL) at room temperature
(rt) under nitrogen. Then, NaOH (beads) (0.080 g, 2.00 mmol) was added
into the above mixture. The resulting solution was stirred at room
temperature for 2 h and then poured into water (10 mL) and EtOAc (10
mL) at the same temperature. The mixture was separated, and the aqueous
layer was extracted with EtOAc (2 × 10 mL). The combined organic
layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and then evaporated to afford (S,S)-7 (1.14 g, 98.4, 84.0% de).

Preparation of Racemic

Hydrochloride 11
The mixture of Ac-AA 10 (50.4 g, 236 mmol) and 6 N hydrochloric acid aq. (202 mL,
1210 mmol) was heated at 100 °C for 4 h. After the reaction was
complete, the reaction mixture was cooled, concentrated, and dried
in vacuo at 50 °C for 3 h, in which the compound was loosened
for good dryness, to give 50 g of a crude. The crude was ground to
a powder as fine as possible and then washed by stirring in acetonitrile
(250 mL) for 30 min. The resulting sticky suspension was filtered,
washed with acetonitrile (100 mL), and dried in vacuo at 50 °C
overnight to afford the AA HCl salt 11 (43.6 g, 88.8%).

mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 2.5 h. After the ligand (S)-3 was consumed, the reaction mixture was
gradually cooled to around 30 °C and then to 0 °C. The cooled
mixture was poured into a cooled acetic acid (45.8 mL, 801 mmol)/distilled
water (1800 mL) solution at 0 °C for 30 min to quench and give
a precipitate. After stirring for 30 min at 0 °C, the precipitate

Procedure
for Disassembly of Diastereomer (S,S)-7; Isolation of Free Zwitterionic
AA (S)-1; and Recycling of Ligand (S)-4
To a suspension of the Ni(II)
complex (S,S)-7 (33.6
g, 48.2 mmol) in methanol (336 mL) was added 3 N hydrochloric acid
aq. (80 mL, 240 mmol), and the whole mixture was heated at 50 °C
for 5 h. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled
to ambient temperature. The resulting precipitate was collected by
filtration (recovered ligand (S)-4),
and the filtrate was concentrated. CH2Cl2 (250
mL) and H2O (200 mL) were added to the residue, and then
the mixture was separated. The aqueous layer was evaporated in vacuo
to the residue, which was dissolved in minimum amount of 9% ammonium
hydroxide and loaded onto a cation-exchange resin column using DIAION
SK-1B (Mitsubishi Chemical Co., 440 mL). The column was first washed
with deionized water until neutral, followed by 9% ammonium hydroxide
to elute the desired amino acid. The aqueous solution obtained was
evaporated to afford AA (S)-1 (8.34
g, quant., 99.2% ee).

(S)-1: 1H NMR (200 MHz, CD3OD): δ = 3.60 (t, J = 6.1 Hz, 1H), 2.16–2.57 (m, 2H), 1.96–2.16
(m, 2H).

Procedure for Disassembly of Diastereomer (S,S)-7; Isolation of Fmoc-AA (S)-12; and Recycling of Ligand (S)-4
To a suspension of the Ni(II) complex (S,S)-7 (38.5 g, 55.2 mmol)
in 1,2-dimetoxyethane (193 mL) was added 3 N hydrochloric acid aq.
(92.0 mL, 276 mmol), and the whole mixture was heated at 50 °C
for 3 h. After the completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled
to ambient temperature. The resulting precipitate was collected by
filtration (1st recovered ligand (S)-3), and the filtrate was concentrated to remove 1,2-dimetoxyethane
and give a white solid in a green solution. The suspension was stirred
at rt for 2 h and filtered to separate the solid (2nd recovered ligand
(S)-4). The filtrate was concentrated
as much as possible to give AA (S)-1 as a green muddy solid (38.8 g, theoretically 9.44 g of amino acid).
To the solid were added distilled water (47 mL), ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) disodium salt dihydrate (20.5 g, 55.2 mmol), and acetonitrile
(27 mL), and the whole mixture was stirred at rt for 30 min. After
cooling to 0 °C, the mixture was basified with sodium carbonate
to pH over 8. After stirring at 0 °C for 10 min, to this heterogeneous
solution was added a suspension of N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyloxy)succinimide
(Fmoc-OSu) (18.6 g, 55.2 mmol) in acetonitrile (20 mL) and stirred
at rt for 4 h with the pH over 8 by addition of sodium carbonate.
After evaporation of the organic solvent, to the aqueous residue was
added ethyl acetate (47 mL). The mixture was acidified with 6 N HCl
to pH 1 to give a precipitate that dissolved with another ethyl acetate
(47 mL). After the separation of an organic layer and an aqueous layer,
the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (x3). The combined
organic layers were washed with water and brain and dried over sodium
sulfate. The organic solution was concentrated to afford crude Fmoc-AA
(S)-12. The crude solid was recrystallized
from ethyl acetate/heptane (1:30, 1350 mL) and dried in vacuo at 50
°C to afford Fmoc-AA (S)-12 (20.2
g, 93.3, 98.2% ee).
