Reactions of a series of (arylimido)vanadium(V)
trialkyl complexes,
V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 (Ar′
= C6H5, 2-MeC6H4, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3), with various phenols (ArOH, Ar = 2,6-F2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2-tBuC6H4, 2,6-tBu2C6H3; 1.0 equiv)
affording V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)2(OAr) were conducted in C6D6 at 25 °C,
and the effects of both arylimido ligands and phenols on the substitution
rate were explored. Sterically hindered arylimido ligands showed lower
reactivity, and the reaction proceeded in the order: Ar′ =
2,6-Me2C6H3 < 2,6-Cl2C6H3 < 2-MeC6H4 <
C6H5. This order is somewhat different from
that obtained from the chemical shifts in V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 in the 51V NMR spectra.
The conversions with various disubstituted phenols increased in the
order: 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH < 2,6-Me2C6H3OH < 2,6-Cl2C6H3OH < 2,6-F2C6H3OH, irrespective of the kind of
arylimido ligands. The reactions of V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 with 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH (1.0 or 3.0 equiv) did not take
place even upon heating at 60 °C. These results suggest that
the reactions proceed via coordination of ArOH toward vanadium, and
the reactivity is highly dependent on steric bulk of both the arylimido
ligand and the phenol.

Introduction
Transition-metal
alkyl complexes are among the most important reagents
or intermediates in organic reactions,1−4 and the study of their reaction chemistry
has been recognized as an important subject for better understanding
especially in catalysis cycles, reaction pathways, and design of efficient
catalysts.1−4 The metal alkyl species play a key role in olefin polymerization,
the core technology for the production of polyolefins in the chemical
industry.5−18 Since classical Ziegler type vanadium catalyst systems display unique
characteristics (highly reactive toward olefins exemplified as production
of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene with narrow molecular weight
distributions),19−21 the reaction chemistry of vanadium–alkyl complexes22−38 should be considered as an important subject in the field of catalysis12,38−41 and organometallic chemistry.42−44

Early transition-metal–alkyl
bonds have been known to be
more nucleophilic than those with late transition metals, and these
are thus highly reactive toward Brönsted/Lewis acids.1−5 For example, cationic alkyl complexes, proposed active species for
olefin polymerization, are formed by treating the dialkyl analogues
with Al alkyls or borate through protonolysis or alkyl abstraction.5−18,40,41 These metal alkyls are generally rapidly reacted with alcohols (or
phenols, ArOH) via protonation or coordination and a subsequent hydrogen
transfer pathway (Scheme 1). It has been, however, reported that steric crowding in
tetrakis(alkyl)-chromium(IV)45,46 and zirconium(IV)47 complexes [exemplified as CrtBu4 and Zr(CH2tBu)4] and (arylimido)vanadium(V) trialkyl complex
(described below)48 contributes to greater
stability toward oxygen and alcohols. For example, Wolczanski et al.47 reported that the synthesis of Zr(CH2tBu)3(OCtBu3) from Zr(CH2tBu)4 by treating with tBu3COH (1.61 equiv) in benzene required 30 h under reflux
conditions (93–95 °C), whereas the synthesis of Zr(CH2Ph)3(OCtBu3) from Zr(CH2Ph)4 with tBu3COH (1.14 equiv) required only 7 h.47

Scheme 1 Two Probable Pathways for Reaction of Metal
Alkyl with Phenol (ArOH)
Moreover, the reaction of V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)3 with excess
2,6-tBu2-4-MeC6H2OH (2.6 equiv) in C2D2Cl4 at 50 °C did not take place, whereas most reactions of V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)3 with 1.0 equiv of less sterically hindered phenols
and alcohols afforded the corresponding dialkyl complexes exclusively
at 25 °C (Scheme 2).48 Synthesis of V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)(O-2,6-Me2C6H3)2 from V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)2(O-2,6-Me2C6H3) by
treating with 2,6-Me2C6H3OH required
50 h at 60 °C for completion, and the reaction did not take place
(or was too slow) at 25 °C. In contrast, immediate phenoxide
ligand exchange was observed when V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)2(O-2,6-Me2C6H3) was treated with 1.0 equiv of
C6F5OH at 25 °C (Scheme 2).49 These results
thus suggest a reaction mechanism by coordination of phenols on the
vanadium metal center (Scheme 2, shown in brackets) and not by protonation. It has also been
assumed that the reason for the negligible reactivity of 2,6-tBu2-4-MeC6H2OH could be due to a steric bulk of two tert-butyl
groups and three CH2SiMe3 ligands that causes
a difficulty of coordination of the phenol to vanadium. Similarly,
the reaction of V(CHSiMe3)(N-1-adamantyl)(CH2SiMe3)(PMe3)2 with C6F5OH became slow when C6F5OD was
used instead of C6F5OH or in presence of PMe3.50 The results also suggest the
mechanism by coordination of C6F5OH accompanied
by dissociation of PMe3.50,51 However, factors
affecting the substitution rates (the electronic nature of phenol
or vanadium metal center, steric bulk for coordination of phenol to
vanadium, etc.) have still been unclear.

(Arylimido)vanadium(V)–alkylidene
complexes containing phenoxide
or alkoxide ligands have been known to display promising characteristics
as catalysts for ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclic
olefins (Scheme 3).42−44,48,50,52−55 These complexes are prepared
from the corresponding dialkyl complexes by α-hydrogen elimination
in the presence of PMe3. The dialkyl complexes are prepared
from the corresponding trialkyl complexes, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3, by treating with 1.0 equiv of phenol
or alcohol.

as Effective Catalysts
for Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization42−44,52−55
In this study, reactions of a series of (arylimido)vanadium(V)
trialkyl complexes, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 (Ar′ = C6H5, 2-MeC6H4, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3), with various phenols, ArOH (Ar
= 2,6-F2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2-tBuC6H4, 2,6-tBu2C6H3) have been conducted to explore factors (the electronic or
steric nature of arylimido ligand or phenol) affecting the reaction
rate for affording the phenoxide complexes, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)2(OAr) (Scheme 4), which have been prepared and identified
independently. The results should provide important information for
a better basic understanding of the reaction of high oxidation state
early transition-metal-alkyls with phenol, which can be proposed to
proceed via coordination of phenol to the metal center.48,49

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of (Arylimido)vanadium(V)–Dialkyl
Complexes
Containing Phenoxide Ligands, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)2(OAr)
A series of (arylimido)vanadium(V)–dialkyl
complexes containing phenoxide ligands, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)2(OAr) [1a–e, 2a–e, 3b,e, 4a–e; Ar′ = C6H5 (1), 2-MeC6H4 (2), 2,6-Me2C6H3 (3), 2,6-Cl2C6H3 (4); Ar = 2,6-F2C6H3 (a), 2,6-Cl2C6H3 (b),
2,6-Me2C6H3 (c), 2,6-iPr2C6H3 (d), 2-tBuC6H4 (e)], could be prepared from V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 by treating with 1.0 equiv of
ArOH in n-hexane at −30 to 25 °C (Scheme 5, synthetic details
are shown in the Experimental Section). These
synthetic procedures are analogous to those reported previously for
syntheses of 3a,c,d,48,49 and the resultant complexes were identified by NMR spectra (shown
in the Supporting Information, SI)a and elemental analysis (except for 3b, 4d, and 4e). Structure of V(N-2,6-Cl2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) (4d) was also confirmed by X-ray
crystallography (detailed analysis and selected bond distances and
angles are shown in the SI).a Complex 4d holds a distorted tetrahedral geometry
around vanadium, and the V–N–C(phenyl) bond angle [167.59(11)°]
is relatively close to that of V(N-2,6-iPr2C6H3)(CH2Ph)3 [5, 169.0(5)°]32 but
is larger than that of V(N-2,6-iPr2C6H3)(CH2Ph)2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3)
[6, 161.7(4)°];32 the
angle is however smaller than that in V(N-1-adamantyl)(CH2SiMe3)3 [7, 180.00(17)°].a The V–N bond distance [1.6627(16) Å]
is close to that in 6 [1.669(5) Å]32 but longer than that in 5 and 7 [1.641(6), 1.6317(14) Å, respectively].,32a The V–O bond distance in 4d [1.7662(12) Å] is slightly longer than that in 6 [1.746(4) Å],32 and the
V–C bond distance [2.0269(19), 2.019(2) Å] is shorter
than that in 5 and 6 [2.048(7)-2.086(8)
Å]32 but close to that in complex 7 [2.0267(18) Å].a

reaction of V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 with 1.0 equiv of ArOH
In contrast, as described below, attempted reactions of
V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 (Ar′
= C6H5, 2-MeC6H4, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3) with 3.0 equiv of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH in C6D6 at 25
°C recovered the trialkyl complexes (data are shown in the SI),b as reported in the
reaction of V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)3 with 2,6-tBu2-4-MeC6H2OH.48

NMR Study for Monitoring Reactions of (Arylimido)vanadium(V)–Trialkyl
Complexes, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3, with Phenols (ArOH)
Reactions of a series of (arylimido)vanadium(V)
trialkyl complexes, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 (Ar′ = C6H5, 2-MeC6H4, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3), with 1.0 equiv of phenols (ArOH,
Ar = 2,6-F2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2-tBuC6H4, 2,6-tBu2C6H3) were conducted in C6D6 at 25
°C, and the time profiles were monitored by 51V and 1H NMR spectra after addition of 1.0 equiv of ArOH (in C6D6, ca. 0.4 mL) into a C6D6 solution containing the trialkyl complex (50 μmol in ca. 0.6
mL).b The conversions of V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 were estimated by the integration
ratio (between the trialkyl and dialkyl complexes) in the 51V NMR spectra; the ratios in the 1H NMR spectra were used
for confirmation (all spectra are shown in the SI).b In reactions using 2,6-Cl2C6H3OH, the conversions were estimated
from 1H NMR spectra as a better resolution was observed.b The selected 51V NMR spectra are summarized
in Figures 1 and 2.b

(conv.) were estimated on the basis of integration ratios of dialkyl/trialkyl
complexes in the 51V NMR spectra (except in the reaction
with 2,6-Cl2C6H3OH).b

2,6-iPr2C6H3OH (after 3.5 h, conv. 63%). Reactions of (e) V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)3 with (f) 2,6-F2C6H3OH (after 10 min, conv. >99%), (g) 2,6-Me2C6H3OH (after 10 min, conv. 37%), and (h) 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH (after
3.5 h, conv. 34%). The conversions were estimated on the basis of
integration ratios of dialkyl/trialkyl complexes in the 51V NMR spectra.b

It turned out that the reaction of V(NC6H5)(CH2SiMe3)3 (Figure 1a) with 2,6-Cl2C6H3OH (1.0 equiv) completed within 40 min [conversion
of the
trialkyl complex (conv.) = 92% after 10 min (Figure 1c) and >99% after 40 min (Figure S2-2)] to afford V(NC6H5)(CH2SiMe3)2(O-2,6-Cl2C6H3) (1b)b and the reaction
with 2-tBuC6H4OH
also completed within 40 min [conv. 95% after 10 min (Figure 1b), >99% after 40 min (Figure S2-5)]. The reaction with 2,6-F2C6H3OH completed within 10 min to afford V(NC6H5)(CH2SiMe3)2(O-2,6-F2C6H3) (1a, Figure S2-1).b In contrast,
the conversions in the reaction with 2,6-Me2C6H3OH became slightly low [conv. 82% after 10 min (Figure 1d), and 95% after
40 min (Figures 1e
and S2-3)]b and the
reaction with 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH proceeded slowly compared with the other phenols
[conv. 34% after 10 min (Figure 1f), 61% after 40 min (Figure S2-4), 94% after 2.5 h (Figure 1g)]. Moreover, the reaction with 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH (3.0 equiv) at 25
°C did not take place even after 6 days (confirmed by 1H and 51V NMR spectra, Figure S2-22).b No additional new resonances in the 51V NMR spectra were observed when the mixture in the reaction
with 1.0 equiv of 2,6-tBu2C6H3OH was heated at 60 °C for 50 h after stirring
at 25 °C for 4 days (no significant changes were observed upon
heating in the 1H NMR spectra, Figure S2-21).b Therefore, the substitution
rates with 1.0 equiv of ArOH increased in the order: Ar = 2,6-tBu2C6H3 ≪
2,6-iPr2C6H3 < 2,6-Me2C6H3 < 2,6-Cl2C6H3, 2-tBuC6H4 < 2,6-F2C6H3 (Scheme 6).
Similarly, as shown in Scheme 6 (and in part in Figure 2),b the conversions in the reaction
of V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)3 with 1.0 equiv of ArOH increased in
the order: Ar = 2,6-tBu2C6H3 (negligible after 6 days, Figure S2-26) ≪ 2,6-iPr2C6H3 (34% conversion after 3.5 h, Figure 2h) < 2,6-Me2C6H3 (37% conversion after 10 min, Figure 2g) < 2,6-Cl2C6H3 (58% after 10 min, Figure S2-12), 2-tBuC6H4 (55%, after 10 min, Figure S2-15) < 2,6-F2C6H3 (>99% after 10 min, Figure 2f). These results clearly suggest that the substitution
rate
decreased with increasing the steric bulk in the phenolic ortho-substituents.

Table 1 summarizes
the results in the reaction of V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 with ArOH (1.0 equiv) in C6D6 at 25 °C.b A similar trend shown
in Scheme 6 was observed
in the reaction of V(N-2,6-Cl2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)3. Moreover, as also
shown in part in Figure 2, the rates in the reaction of V(N-2-MeC6H4)(CH2SiMe3)3 with ArOH (1.0 equiv)
increased in the order: Ar = 2,6-tBu2C6H3 ≪ 2,6-iPr2C6H3 < 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2-tBuC6H4 < 2,6-Cl2C6H3 < 2,6-F2C6H3; the degree in
the reaction with 2-tBuC6H4OH was close to that in the reaction with 2,6-Me2C6H3OH.

To estimate the electronic
nature in ArOH, pKa values (in aqueous
solution) in the disubstituted phenols57−59 have been chosen, although
these reactions were conducted in C6D6 (or n-hexane for isolation).
It turned out that the observed orders on the substitution rates are
somewhat different from the pKa values:
2,6-Cl2C6H3OH (pKa = 6.79)57 2,6-F2C6H3OH (7.58)58 <
2,6-Me2C6H3OH (10.59)57 < 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH (11.1).59 In fact, the reaction of V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)3 with 1.0 equiv
of PhOH (pKa = 9.99)57 completed within 10 min to afford V(N-2,6-Me2C6H3)(CH2SiMe3)2(OPh)b (data are shown in the SI, Figure S2-29).b It also
turned out that the phenylimido complex showed higher conversions
than the other arylimido complexes and the degree increased in the
order: Ar′ = 2,6-Me2C6H3 <
2,6-Cl2C6H3 < 2-MeC6H4 < C6H5. The observed trend
is somewhat different from that on the basis of chemical shifts in
the 51V NMR spectra, which could be related to the nucleophilic
nature in the (arylimido)vanadium complexes (Table 1).60 Taking into
account these results, as described above, it is clear that the steric
bulk in ArOH plays a role in the substitution rate.

Concluding Remarks
We have conducted reactions of various (arylimido)vanadium(V)–trialkyl
complexes, V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 (Ar′ = C6H5, 2-MeC6H4, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3), with 1.0 equiv of phenols (ArOH,
Ar = 2,6-F2C6H3, 2,6-Cl2C6H3, 2,6-Me2C6H3, 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2-tBuC6H4, 2,6-tBu2C6H3) in C6D6 at 25 °C and explored
effects of both arylimido ligand and phenol on the substitution rate.
The phenylimido complex showed the highest conversions, and the degree
increased in the order: Ar′ = 2,6-Me2C6H3 < 2,6-Cl2C6H3 <
2-MeC6H4 < C6H5. The
order is somewhat different from that obtained from the chemical shifts
in V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 in the 51V NMR spectra. Moreover, conversions in the reaction of V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 with disubstituted phenols increased
in the order: 2,6-iPr2C6H3OH < 2,6-Me2C6H3OH < 2,6-Cl2C6H3OH <
2,6-F2C6H3OH, irrespective of the
kind of the arylimido ligands employed. The order is also somewhat
different from that of pKa values (employed
for estimation of the electronic nature), and the reactions of V(NAr′)(CH2SiMe3)3 with 1.0 (and 3.0) equiv of
2,6-tBu2C6H3OH did not take place even upon heating at 60 °C.56 Taking into account these results, it is highly
suggested that, as proposed previously,42,48−50 the reactions proceeded by coordination of phenols into the vanadium
metal center. Through this study, it is clear that steric bulk in
both arylimido and phenol affects the substitution rate. We highly
believe that the results should be promising and should be useful
for better understanding, especially in the field of organometallic
chemistry of vanadium.

Experimental Section
General Procedures
All experiments were performed under
a nitrogen atmosphere in a vacuum atmosphere (VAC) drybox. Anhydrous
grade n-hexane, tetrahydrofuran, and dichloromethane
(Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) and n-octane (Aldrich)

Synthesis of V(N-2,6-Cl2C6H3)Cl3
VOCl3 (4.18 g, 24.1 mmol) was
added into a n-octane (50 mL) solution containing
2,6-dichlorophenyl isocyanate (2.73 g, 14.5 mmol) in a sealed Schlenk
tube in the drybox. After washing the tube with n-octane (5 mL), the mixture was heated in an oil bath at 140 °C
and the mixture was stirred overnight (17 h). During the reaction
especially at the beginning, the CO2 by-product was carefully
removed from the mixture through a nitrogen line. After the reaction,
the mixture was cooled at room temperature and was filtered through
a celite pad. The filter cake was washed with n-hexane
to extract VCl3(N-2,6-Cl2C6H3). Combined, the filtrate and wash liquid were
added to toluene and placed in vacuo to remove volatiles. The resultant
solid was dissolved in a minimum amount of dichloromethane, and the
chilled solution (−30 °C) afforded a deep green solid
(4.43 g, 14.0 mmol). Yield: 97% (based on 2,6-dichlorophenyl isocyanate). 1H NMR (C6D6): δ 5.79 (t, 1H, J = 7.5, Ar-H), 6.27 (d, 2H, J = 7.5, Ar-H). 51V NMR (C6D6): δ 262 (Δν1/2 = 354 Hz). 13C NMR (C6D6): δ 127.6, 131.2, 135.4, 165.6. Anal. calcd for C6H3Cl5NV: C, 22.71; H, 0.95; N, 4.41. Found:
