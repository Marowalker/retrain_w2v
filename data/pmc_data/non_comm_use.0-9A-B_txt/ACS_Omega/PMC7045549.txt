The
beneficial effect of polyphenols and magnesium(II) against
oxidative stress motivated our research group to explore the antioxidant
activity of phenMgIso, an aqueous soluble magnesium(II) complex containing
1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and isovanillic acid (Iso) as ligands.
Combined electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry and DOSY-NMR
techniques identified two complexes in methanolic solution: hexacoordinated
[Mg(phen)2(Iso)]+ and tetracoordinated [Mg(phen)(Iso)]+. The cyclic voltammogram of phenMgIso in the anodic region
showed a cyclic process that interrupts the isovanillic acid degradation,
probably by stabilization of the corresponding phenoxyl radical via
complexation with Mg(II), which is interesting for antioxidant applications.
phenMgIso competes with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine by 1O2 with IC50(1O2) = 15
μg m–1 and with nitrotetrazolium blue chloride
by superoxide ions (IC50(O2•–) = 3.6 μg mL–1). Exposure of both zebrafish
(2 mg L–1) and wistar male rats (3 mg kg–1 day–1 dose for 21 days) to phenMgIso does not
cause mortality or visual changes compared with the respective control
groups, thus phenMgIso could be considered safe under the conditions
of this study. Moreover, no significant changes in comparison to both
control groups were observed in the biochemical parameters on the
brain-acetylcholinesterase activity, digestive tract enzyme catalase,
and glutathione-S-transferase. Conversely, the performance of superoxide
dismutase activity in wistar male rats increased in the presence of
a complex, resulting in enhanced capacity of rats for superoxide radical
enzymatic scavenging. The synergistic action of phenMgIso may be explained
by the strong electrostatic interaction between Mg(II) and the O,O(phenolate)
group, which makes the Iso ligand easier to oxidize and deprotonate,
generating a cyclic stable species under oxidative conditions.

1 Introduction
The
therapeutic effects of polyphenols associated with cytoprotection
during inflammation and with prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
and neurodegenerative diseases1 have aroused
considerable interest in the protective mechanisms of these compounds
against the oxidative stress chemistry and biochemistry of polyphenols2 and their delivery mechanisms. A fundamental
issue that should be considered in planning a delivery system of polyphenols
is their low bioavailability and susceptibility to generate harmful
radical species.

In this regard, considerable attention has
turned to the reactivity
of complexes formed by chelation of polyphenols with essential metals,
in particular those involved in antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/Zn
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Fe(II/III) metabolism.4−6 The interest in understanding the role of these metals in natural
processes is justified, in part, because they represent a guideline
to exemplify the mechanisms of oxidative stress control by these polyphenols
and provide clues to the development of new pharmacological antioxidant
compounds. For example, coordination of a deprotonate polyphenol to
Fe(III) produces a neutral quinone and free Fe(II), which at low pH
may participate in Fenton reactions to produce an OH• radical. Consequently, Fe(II/III)–O,O(phenolate) complexes
present both antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties. Redox-inactive
metal ions such as Zn(II) may also control the oxidative stress in
the biological medium. Zn(II) protection occurs indirectly either
by chelation of specific protein sites or by competing with pro-oxidant
metals (Cu and Fe).3−8 A recent study on Zn(II)–kaempferol has shown
interesting antioxidant properties.9

Similar to zinc(II), magnesium(II) is essential in a remarkable
number of biological processes, in which it plays a structural and/or
catalytic role, and its deficiency also affects the antioxidant enzyme
system; however, the mechanism behind these effects is still not fully
understood.10−19 Mg(II) is a hard acid and forms, preferentially, hexacoordinated
complexes with oxygen atoms,20−23 and those containing carboxylate groups have gained
particular attention. For example, the interconversion from the monodentate
(through hydroxyl) to the bidentate (through hydroxyl and carboxyl)
coordination of the carboxylate group to Mg(II) in control of the
reactivity of Mg(II) has been studied.24 Furthermore, increased attention has also been directed to the contribution
of hydrogen bonds in the control of coordinated water acidity.25 Recent studies have explored this in detail
in a series of magnesium carboxylate complexes containing intramolecular
NH···O hydrogen bonds using theoretical calculations
and X-ray analysis.26−29

Additionally, neutral chelating N,N-aromatic ligands can also
be
employed to control the water ligand exchange in hexacoordinated Mg(II)
complexes. Among the many ligands investigated, 1,10-phenanthroline
(phen) provides a selection of Mg–phen complexes with a varying
number of coordinated water molecules, such as [Mg(phen)2(H2O)2]2+,9 [Mg(SO4)(phen)(H2O)3],10 and [Mg(phen)3]2+.11 Mixed mono- and binuclear aquo-Mg(II) complexes
containing the anionic tetrazole ligand have been prepared and investigated.30 Among them, Mg(II)-1,3-benzene-dicarboxilic
(DBHC) [Mg(H2O)2(phen)(HBDC)2] shows
chiral properties.31

Mg(II) complexes
containing the flavonoid quercetin have also been
investigated, which showed encouraging antioxidant properties compared
to free quercetin for the free radical scavenging activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl.32

In this context, we have recently prepared
the Mg–phen complex
containing the flavonoid hesperidin (hesp). The [Mg(hesp)2(phen)] complex shows an interesting profile of activities with high
hydrophilicity and superoxide radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 68.3 μM at pH 7.8) and uptake by Hela cancer cells
with no apparent cytotoxicity while maintaining luminescence in vitro,
which enables cellular and distribution localization investigations.33

These findings created the opportunity
to investigate the effects
of the coordination of a polyphenol in the Mg(II)-polypyridine moiety
on the reactivity of the potential antioxidant complex. This study
reports the synthesis and characterization of a Mg(II) complex containing
1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and isovanillic acid (Iso) as ligands.
It also describes the antioxidant activity of this complex against
the reactive oxygen species, the toxicity to zebrafish and wistar
male rats, and the protective effect to SOD enzymes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Structural
Characterization
of the Complex in Solution
The synthesis of the Mg complex
using Mg(CH3COO)2, 1,10-phenanthroline, and
isovanillic acid in 1:1:1 proportion in methanol with tetraethylammonium
led to the formation of a mixture of hexacoordinated and tetracoordinated
complexes, as illustrated in Figure 1. The complexes were characterized by mass spectrometry
(MS) [electrospray ionization (ESI)–MS] and NMR spectroscopy,
and the geometries were optimized using density functional theory
(DFT).

Figure 1 ESI(+)-MS spectrum of a freshly prepared methanolic solution of
the phenMgIso complex.

2.1.1 ESI–Mass
Spectrometry
The
mass spectrum of a freshly prepared methanolic solution shows the
presence of three signals at m/z 551.1578 (hexacoordinated [Mg(phen)2(Iso)]+, Mg-hex), m/z 331.0887 (tetracoordinated
[Mg(phen)(Iso)]+, Mg-tet), and at m/z 909.2112 (Mg-bi) (low-intensity peak) corresponding to
two mononuclear complexes and one binuclear complex, respectively,
and a signal corresponding to a free phenanthroline ligand at m/z 181.0769 (Figures 1 and S1). The
fragmentation pattern of the ion of m/z 551 at 35 eV shows the loss of one phen ligand (Figure S2), giving rise to a tetradentate [Mg(phen)(Iso)]+ ion complex (m/z 371.08)
and indicating that the interaction of Mg with Iso is stronger than
that with phen in the gas phase. By increasing the collision energy
to >50 eV, no further loss of intact ligand occurs; instead, formation
of fragments from the cleavage of covalent bonds was observed (m/z 356.06, 327.09, and 312.07).

The MS/MS spectrum of m/z 909.21
(Mg-bi) at 20 eV shows a base peak at m/z 729.14, corresponding to the loss of a phen ligand [(Mg-bi)-1phen]+, and two low abundant peaks at m/z 551.15 and 371.08, which were attributed to the [Mg-hex]+ and [Mg-tet]+ ions, respectively (Figure S2).

It should be noted that when
the same solution is kept in the dark
for 3 days, only two complexes are present, Mg-hex and Mg-tet, in
addition to a free phen ligand, indicating the transient characteristic
of the high mass species. In agreement, Mg(II) preferentially forms
octahedral complexes, although tetrahedral complexes have also been
reported depending on the ligand strength.34,35

2.1.2 NMR Studies
The 1H NMR
spectra of the mixture of phenMgIso complexes at 298 K in MeOD (Figure 2, bottom spectrum)
show a set of broad signals that correspond to the isovanillic acid
(6.7–7.5 ppm) and phenanthroline (7.5–9.2 ppm) ligands.
The broadening of the NMR signal can be associated with the low natural
abundance (almost 10%) for the 25Mg isotope (spin 5/2)
and the extension of the quadrupolar moment relaxation from these
ions on the adjacent protons,36 but it
may also be attributed to ligand-exchange reactions.37

Figure 2 Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra of the phenMgIso
complex in MeOD.

In this context, an NMR
experiment was performed under variable
temperatures: 298–253 K (Figure 2). During the progressive decrease in temperature,
the 1H NMR spectra showed a split of the phenanthroline
signals into two different sets: one with sharp lines, which resembles
a free-phen solution, and the other described by broad signals, which
is expected for a coordinated phen ligand. To probe the mediated temperature
dynamics of this complexation, a DOSY-NMR investigation was performed.

The NMR-DOSY map collected at 298 K shows two distinguishable diffusion
coefficients (Figure 3, left-hand side), proving the existence of two individual components.
The component with signals associated with the phenanthroline moiety
(with D = 1.53 × 10–5 mm2/s) exhibits faster diffusion compared with the second component,
which is attributed to the isovanillic acid moiety (D = 1.55 × 10–6 mm2/s). In contrast,
in the map collected at 253 K (Figure 3, right-hand side), two distinguishable diffusions
are still observed but with some differences. The first component,
with faster diffusion (D = 1.07 × 10–5 mm2/s), remains associated with a free phenanthroline
group, here with a smaller D because of the lower
temperature, whereas the second component exhibits a diffusion coefficient
associated with both broader phenanthroline and Iso signals (D = 1.22 × 10–6 mm2/s),
proving that these two ligands are complexed into the same magnesium
center. These results indicate that at low temperature, the chemical
equilibrium shifts to the formation of only one complex, probably
the tetracoordinated one, Mg-tet. Moreover, at room temperature, the
fast equilibrium between the two structures might be responsible for
the two different diffusions. At intermediate temperatures (278–258
K, Figure S3), the phenanthroline equilibrium
dynamics is quite well observed, for example, where their resonances
split into two sets of signals, both with two different diffusion
coefficients.

Figure 3 1H-DOSY-NMR map obtained for the phenMgIso
complex in
MeOD at 298 K (left-hand side) and 253 K (right-hand side).

This pattern is consistent with equilibrium between
the Mg-hex
and Mg-tet complexes and can be associated with a rapid phen ligand
exchange process. Moreover, the presence of a free phenanthroline
signal at m/z 181.0769 reinforces
the hypothesis of a dynamic phen ligand-exchange process. Indeed,
the molecular structures of the complexes were also confirmed by DFT
calculations using B3LYP/6-31+G*. Both structures are in their true
energy minima because no imaginary frequency was detected (Tables S1 and S2). Also, a previous report demonstrated
that some Cu(I) complexes containing phen ligands exist in equilibrium
between the Cu(I) structures.37

The
small size of the Mg(II) ion facilitates the steric repulsion
between the phen ligands, thus a steric control between two phen units
may occur and promote the interconversion between the two structures
identified in the mass spectra.

2.2 Cyclic
Voltammetry
The cyclic voltammetry
of isovanillic acid in aqueous solution, pH 7.4, in the first oxidative
process showed only one single broad anodic wave at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl
and no reverse cathodic response. As shown in Figure 4, dependence of the anodic current on the
scan rate was indicative of a chemical reaction because of oxidation
of the phenol group. These data confirm the findings of Simić
for related polyphenols.38

Figure 4 Cyclic voltammograms
of isovanillic acid (A) and phenMgIso (B)
in buffered solution at pH 7.4 with 0.1 M KCl in a screen-printed
electrochemical array formed by three-electrochemical cell with glassy
carbon as the working (d = 4 mm) and counter electrode
and silver as the reference electrode. The reduction peak around −0.50
V is ascribed to blank solution, phosphate buffer, in the presence
of KCl.

The coordination of Iso to the
Mg(II) complex has a significant
effect on the stability of phenoxyl radical generated. As illustrated
in Figure 4, for phenMgIso,
the first oxidative scan shows only one single anodic wave at +0.65
V. The second scan shows a new oxidation at −0.12 V (II) and
−0.14 V (process II′), whereas the original wave shifted
to a more positive potential with an increase in the current height.
In subsequent scans, the peak currents for waves II′ and II
decreased in intensity at the expense of two new responses at +0.17
V (III) and +0.10 V (III′), whereas the peak current for wave
I kept increasing in current intensity and shifted to +0.8 V. After
10 scans, the species generated electrochemically are stabilized.
As shown in Figure S4, the cyclic voltammetry
process is highly dependent on solution pH; the reductive response
III, III′ is facilitated at high pH, whereas the second couple
is facilitated at low pH.

This type of behavior is characteristic
of an electron-transfer
process coupled to a proton-transfer process.38,39

In the phenMgIso complex, the role of Mg(II) is to stabilize
the
phenolate group of the Iso ligand through a strong electrostatic interaction
that makes the Iso ligand easier to deprotonate and oxidize, generating
a stable cyclic species under the electrochemical process. Based on
the voltammetric data obtained and in the literature results,39 the entire electrochemical process is associated
with the formation and stabilization of the phenoxyl radical, as shown
in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Mechanism
Proposed to the Electrochemical Process of phenMgIso
Distribution of the Mulliken charges on phenMgIso is in
agreement
with the increased acidity of the Iso ligand with coordination to
Mg(II) (Table S3). For the Mg–Iso
bond, the negative charge on the oxygen of O–H(Iso) is decreased
from −0.59 to −0.25 when the complex is formed so that
the isovanillate ligand becomes less negatively charged (0.34 net
charge) and easier to deprotonate, thus making the complex easier
to oxidize.

2.3 In Vitro Antioxidant Activity
According
to these results, it seems reasonable to consider the antioxidant
activity of phenMgIso. As shown in Figure 5, in aqueous solution, the complex competes
efficiently with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) by 1O2. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) assay shown
in Figure 5 was based
on the competition between TEMP and the sample in scavenging the 1O2 generated by the photoactivation of riboflavin.40 The IC50 value was 15 ± 0.3
μg mL–1 for phenMgIso. No inhibitory effect
was found for free 1,10-phenanthroline.

mL–1—red line; 2.4 μg mL–1—blue line; 3.3 μg mL–1—green
line; 8.4 μg mL–1—dark blue line; 12
μg mL–1—pink line).

The phenMgIso complex is also a good quencher for superoxide
scavenging.
In this experiment, the antioxidant activity of phenMgIso was assessed
using the VitB2/Met/NBT assay.41 Accordingly,
the results of nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) spectrophotometric
analysis show that the IC50 value of the complex for superoxide
scavenging is 3.7 μg L–1.

Based on the
promising results from the antioxidant activity of
phenMgIso, the toxicity profile in vivo using zebrafish and wistar
male rat models was investigated.

2.4 In Vivo
Toxicity against Zebra Fish and Wistar
Male Rats
2.4.1 Zebrafish
In the course of resistance
test, regardless of exposure of zebrafish to complex concentrations
up to 2.0 mg L–1, no mortality or visual alterations
on the fishes were observed after 96 h of treatment. Figure 6 shows that exposure of zebrafish
to phenMgIso does not affect neither the brain-AChE activity nor the
digestive-tract-enzyme catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase
(GST) in all concentrations investigated.

Figure 6 Activity of (A) brain
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), (B,C) digestive-tract
CAT, and GST and levels of (D) lipid peroxidation and (E) SOD enzymes
of zebrafish after 96 h of exposure to different concentrations of
phenMgIso (0.20, 1.00, and 2.00 mg L–1)and control
(CTR). Data are mean ± SE, n = 6–10.
No significant difference in the mean value compared with the CTR
(p < 0.05). Activity is expressed as μmol/min/mg
protein.

2.4.2 Wistar
Male Rats
No mortality or
adverse signs of toxicity were observed in the laboratory-bred wistar
male rats exposed to repeat treatment with phenMgIso at a concentration
of 3.0 mg kg–1 per day for 21 days until a total
dose of 62 mg kg–1 was reached.

Figure S5 shows that phenMgIso produces an increase
in the spontaneous locomotor activity of rats and a reduction of climbing.
Accordingly, there was a slight increase in the percentage of time
spent in the open arm compartment as compared with control. The treatment
used in this experiment is in accordance with the standard anxiolytic
drugs delivered for mice when they were treated with diazepam (2 mg/kg),
imipramine (20 mg/kg), and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg).42

In agreement with these results, the levels of brain
enzymes SOD
in the striatum, glutathione reductase (GSH) in the frontal cortex,
and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampus increased after
phenMgIso treatment (Figure 7), indicating that the complex crosses the blood–brain
barrier. Moreover, the biochemical analysis of kidney and liver showed
increased activity of CAT and SOD enzymes (Figure 7), evincing that the complex does not induce
toxic manifestations in these organs. The decrease in the activity
of GSH in the kidney after treatment with the complex probably reflects
the increased antioxidant activity of CAT and SOD because of phenMgIso
presence.

Figure 7 Activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), SOD, CAT, GST, and GSH
in the regions of brain (hippocampus, striatum, and frontal cortex)
as well as in the liver and kidney of wistar male rats after 21 days
of exposure to 3.0 mg kg–1 per day of phenMgIso
and CTR. Data are mean ± SE, n = 6–10.
No significant difference in mean value compared with the CTR (p < 0.05). Activity is expressed as μmol/min/mg
protein. Control results are shown in the dotted areas.

In light of these results, it is probable that the antioxidant
activity of phenMgIso to aquatic zebrafish and terrestrial wistar
male rats involves superoxide radical scavenging.

3 Conclusions
Two phenMgIso complexes coexist in methanolic
solution, [Mg(phen)2(Iso)] and [Mg(phen)Iso], although
the complexes seem to have
preference for a hexacoordinated complex at room temperature over
a tetracoordinated complex at low temperature. Electrochemical oxidation
indicates a cyclic mechanism that stabilizes the phenoxyl radical
and corroborates the high in vitro and probable in vivo antioxidant
activity of phenMgIso. No mortality or evident toxic effect to zebrafish
and wistar male rats exposed to phenMgIso was observed. Altogether,
these results indicate the potential of phenMgIso as a novel antioxidant
candidate.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Methods
All NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer for hydrogen
nucleus. Data acquisition and processing were performed with Bruker
software TopSpin 3.5 pl 7. For NMR experiments, the samples were dissolved
in tetradeuterated methanol (methanol-d4) and were analyzed
at different temperatures from 298 lowering to 253 K. All chemical
shifts (δ) are given in parts per million unit, with reference
to the hydrogen signal of the methyl group of tetramethylsilane as
the internal reference, and the coupling constants (J) are described in hertz.

Magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 1,10′-phenanthroline
(phen), isovanillic acid (iso), phosphoric acid, monobasic potassium
phosphate, dibasic potassium phosphate, and tribasic potassium phosphate
were purchased from Aldrich. The following reagents, purchased from
Aldrich, were used to assess the antioxidant capacity of the complex:
riboflavin (vitamin B2), TEMP, NBT, and methionine. Organic solvents
were of high-performance liquid chromatography grade, and aqueous
solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water.
