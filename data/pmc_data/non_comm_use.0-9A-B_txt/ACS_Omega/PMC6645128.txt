We report very fast, green, and large-scale
synthesis of amino-functionalized
carbon quantum dots (CQDs) using a domestic microwave to investigate
CQD-Tb-based dual emission for visual detection of toxic Hg2+. Citric acid and p-phenylenediamine are used as
precursor materials to synthesize the CQD, which shows excitation-independent
blue luminescence. To achieve the dual emission, Tb-containing CQD
is synthesized in a very easy and cost-effective way. These dual-emissive
fluorescent materials have been successfully used as a fluorescent
indicator for visual detection of toxic Hg2+ metal ions.
An instant color change from blue to green in the presence of a very
low amount of Hg2+ under a UV lamp (λ365nm) is observed. The material is highly sensitive and selective toward
detection of mercury ions in the presence of other metal ions. The
photoluminescence quenching mechanism (photoinduced electron transfer
process) has been explained using an electronic band diagram supported
by zeta-potential and time-correlated single photon counting measurements.

1 Introduction
Fluorescent
carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a new class of carbon-based
nanomaterials with a size of less than 10nm, having emerging potential
applications. Carbon dots are more superior than other semiconducting
nanomaterials because of their good optical properties, eco-friendliness,
lower toxicity, simple synthetic method, low cost, good water solubility,
and good photo stability. CQDs have a broad range of applications
in many fields such as bioimaging,1,2 drug delivery,3 sensing,4−12 catalysis,13−15 super capacitor,16,17 security ink,18 optoelectronic,19 and so forth. During the last few years, CQDs have been used as
sensor materials for sensing heavy toxic metal ions such as Hg2+,20−22 Pb2+,23,24 Cr6+,25,26 or explosive nitro aromatics.27−29 Fluorescent quantum dots with dual-emissive colors for visual detection
of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) using a UV lamp were reported a few
years back.30 A carbon dot-based dual-emission
nanohybrid having ratiometric fluorescence has been used for biological
imagining of Cu2+ ions.31 Very
recently, a carbon dot–silicon nanoparticle hybrid has been
used for detection of nanometric Cu2+ ions.32

Hg2+ is one of the most toxic
heavy metal ions which
seriously affect the human body and the environment. Inorganic mercury
salt or organic mercury compound, especially methyl mercury, is the
main pollutant of soil and water sources such as river, lakes, or
groundwater. Industries and coal-burning power plants are also responsible
for Hg pollution. From this contaminated water, mercury directly enters
into the food chain, which causes harmful effects on the human body
such as brain damage, kidney problem, Minamata disease, pink’s
disease, muscle weakness, and so forth. Therefore, because of this
serious problem, people have great concerns about the detection of
Hg2+-contaminated areas. Different analytical methods are
being used to detect Hg2+, such as selective cold vapor
atomic spectrometry,33 atomic absorption
spectrometry/atomic emission spectrometry,34 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,35 and so forth. However, these methods are very selective
and sensitive, but some impediments are still present in the sample
preparation, such as lack of cost effectiveness and sophisticated
instrumentation. Nowadays, luminescence properties of some semiconducting
nanomaterials such as CdS,36 CdSe37 nanoparticles, functionalized graphene oxide,38 and MoS2 quantum dots39 are used to detect Hg2+ and nitroaromatics.
Carbon-based quantum dots are also used to detect metal ions because
of very good water solubility, low toxicity, high quantum yield, and
low-cost materials. Hetero atom-doped carbon dots for Hg2+ detection are also reported. However, a simple method of sample
preparation with visual fluorescence detection of Hg2+ using
dual emission is indeed an attractive area of research.

Therefore,
in the present work, we report a simple, green, and
large-scale synthesis of amino-functionalized CQDs using a domestic
microwave in which citric acid and p-phenylenediamine
are used as precursor materials. As-synthesized carbon dots show excitation-independent
blue luminescence with a high quantum yield of 44.5%. To investigate
a carbon dot-based dual-emission nanocomposite for Hg2+ detection, we have synthesized Tb-containing CQD in a very easy
and cost-effective way. These dual-emissive fluorescent materials
have been successfully used as a fluorescent indicator for visual
detection of toxic Hg2+ metal ions. These materials show
an instant color change from blue to green in the presence of a very
low amount of Hg2+ under a UV lamp (λ365nm). It shows very high sensitivity and selectivity toward the mercury
ions in the presence of other metal ions with a lower detection limit
of 168.8 ppb. We have also explained the photoluminescence (PL) quenching
mechanism [photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process] with an electronic
band diagram supported by zeta-potential and time-correlated single
photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. The details are reported in
this paper.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material
Characterization
High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to investigate the
morphology of as-synthesized CQDs. Figure 1a shows the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of CQDs. It is seen that the carbon dots are well dispersed
with the size varying from 2 to 6 nm. The HRTEM (Figure S1) image of CQDs shows the crystalline nature with
lattice spacing of 0.216 nm, suggesting the formation of CQDs.40 The size distribution curve of the as-synthesised
carbon dots is shown in Figure 1b. The Gaussian-fitted curve shows the average size of quantum
dots as 3.4 nm with a standard deviation of 0.16 nm.

Figure 1 (a) TEM images of pure
CQD; (b) size distribution histogram of
pure CQD; (c) XRD spectra of pure CQD; (d) FT-IR spectra of pure CQD
and the CQD-Tb composite material.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the CQDs in Figure 1c shows that a broad
diffraction
peak appears at 30.1° with a poor hump at 19.4° corresponding
to an interlayer spacing of 3.29 and 5.07 Å, respectively, suggesting
that an amorphous structure is formed with more oxygen and a nitrogen-functional
group bonded on the edge of the basal plane of the quantum dots.41

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of pure carbon dots
and composite materials are shown in Figure 1d. Pure carbon dots show a broad absorption
peak at 3100–3500 cm–1 (3257 and 3430 cm–1) for N–H and O–H bond stretching vibrations.
The peaks at 1721 and 1880 cm–1 correspond to stretching
vibrations of C=O and C=N bonds, respectively. Peaks
appear at 1198 and 1130 cm–1 because of C–N
and C–O stretching vibrations.42,43 The peak for
COO– stretching vibration appears at 1386 cm–1 and C–O–C symmetric and asymmetric
stretching vibrations occur at 1062 and 1302 cm–1, respectively. The peak for the aromatic C–H bond appears
in the range of 600–800 cm–1. The CQD-Tb
composite material also shows the same spectral nature as pure CQD
but the peaks for C=O, C–O, COO–,
C=N are shifted to 1710, 1112, 1405, and 1572 cm–1, respectively.44,45 This indicates that Tb is coordinated
with the functional group of carbon dots (low-range FT-IR spectra
of both materials are shown in Supporting Information Figures S2 and S3).

The zeta-potential value of carbon dots
is −17.5 mV, shown
in Figure S4. It indicates that more electron-rich
functional groups (−NH2, −OH, −CONH2) are present at the surface of the carbon dots.46

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
is used to understand the
elemental composition of CQD-Tb composite materials. X-ray photoelectron
spectra of the sample are presented in Figure 2a, which consist of four elements C 1s at
286 eV, N 1s at 400 eV, O 1s at 534 eV, and Tb 3d and 4d at 1242,
1274 and 148 eV, respectively, with the atomic percentage of C-58.59%,
N-16.37%, O-20.75%, and Tb-4.29%. The high-resolution deconvoluted
spectra of C 1s (Figure 2b) are assigned to four different peaks at 284.3, 285.7, 287.6, and
289.2 eV for C–C/C=C of graphitic carbon, C–N,
C–O, and C=N bonds, respectively. In the deconvoluted
spectra of N 1s, the peaks at 398.3, 399.6, and 400.7 eV are assigned
to graphitic N, N–H (amino), and C–N bonds, respectively
(Figure 2c). This indicates
that the electron-rich amino group is present at the surface of the
carbon dots. Figure 2d shows two separated peaks of O 1s at 531.8 and 535.5 eV assigned
to C=O and C–OH bonds, respectively. Figure 2e,f shows the high-resolution
spectra of Tb 3d and 4d. Peaks at 1241 and 1276 eV correspond to Tb
3d5/2 and 3d3/2 and 146.8 and 152.7 eV for Tb
4d.47 It is seen that the binding energy
for Tb 4d of the CQD-Tb composite material decreases to 146.8 eV (ΔE = 4.8 eV) as compared to TbCl3 (151.6 eV).47 However, the binding energies for −C=O
(531.8 eV) and −C–OH (535.5 eV) of CQD-Tb increase by
ΔEC=O = 0.7 eV and ΔE–C–OH = 3.2 eV as compared to
the reported binding energy of NCQD.43 This
result suggested that the Tb3+ ion gets coordinated with
the O-containing functional group of the carbon dots. Because of the
coordination, the electron density of the O atom decreases and the
Tb3+ ion increases as obtained from XPS data.

high-resolution peaks for Tb 3d of CQD-Tb.

2.2 Optical Properties of Quantum Dots
UV–vis spectra of the solution containing CQDs shown in Figure S5 give two absorption peaks at 260 and
330 nm corresponding to π → π* transition of C=C,
C=N and n → π* transition of C=N and C=O,
respectively.

The PL spectra of as-synthesized CQDs are shown
in Figure 3a. With
tuning excitation wavelength from 295 to 415 nm, an excitation-independent
PL behavior is observed. The maximum intense peak occurs at 442 nm
when excited at 360 nm. This excitation-independent PL property is
observed because of the narrow distribution of particle size and a
lesser number of defect states present in the quantum dots. This lower
value of defect states created in the present quantum dots arises
because of the functionalization of the amino-benzene group rather
than the doping of the nitrogen atom in the carbon dots.48 The fluorescence quantum yield of the as-synthesized
carbon dots is calculated to about 44.5% with respect to quinine sulfate
as a reference.

Figure 3 (a) Excitation-independent PL spectra of the pure CQD
solution;
(b) PL spectra of the CQD-Tb composite.

The PL spectra of the CQD-Tb composite material (Figure 3b) show the excitation-independent
PL properties but because of the attachment of the Tb3+ ion on the carbon moiety through the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of
the surface group of carbon dots, some additional narrow peaks appear
at 490, 546, 587, and 622 nm. As a result of the attachment of Tb
in the carbon dots’ moiety, another energy state (5D4) is generated near the valence band of the carbon dots
and transition from this level to a lower level emits light in the
green region. The emission bands at 490, 546, 587, and 622 nm correspond
to 5D4 → 7F6, 5D4 → 7F5, 5D4 → 7F4, and 5D4 → 7F3 transition, respectively.49

2.3 Visual Detection of Hg2+ in Aqueous
Solution
Our as-synthesized CQD-Tb composite materials have
dual-emission bands in the blue and green regions. Therefore, we have
successfully used this material for visual detection of Hg2+ in aqueous solution using a hand UV lamp (λ365nm). To perform the quenching experiment, 4 mL of this material is
taken in a quartz tube and PL spectra are recorded at 365 nm excitation
after addition of 10 μL of 400 μM Hg2+ solution,
shown in Figure 4a.
We have seen that after gradual addition of Hg2+ solution,
the color of the luminescent quantum dots changes from intense blue
to bright green because of the gradual PL quenching corresponding
to the 442 nm peak. It is seen that about 97% PL quenching (442 nm)
occurs in the presence of only 3 ppm Hg2+ in aqueous solution. Figure 4b shows the Commission
Internationale de l’Elcairage (CIE) index with the color change
from blue to green after addition of Hg2+ at a 365 nm excitation.
A digital photograph of the color change of the CQD-Tb solution in
the presence of different concentrations of Hg2+ under
a UV lamp (λ365nm) is shown in Figure 4. Therefore, this material is highly sensitive
for visual detection of Hg2+ in aqueous solution.

of different amounts of 400 μM Hg(II) solution at pH 7. (b)

of Hg2+ ions at 365 nm excitation; below-digital photograph
of the CQD-Tb solution in the presence of different amounts of Hg2+ ions under a hand UV lamp (λ365nm).

Quenching efficiencies are analyzed
by the Stern–Volmer
plot using the following equation  where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities
of quantum dots in the
presence and absence of Hg2+, [Q] is the concentration
of the Hg2+ ion, and Ksv is
the quenching constant. From Figure 5a, it is seen that for a lower concentration range
from 0.2 to 0.8 ppm, the curve rises linearly but with increasing
the concentration of Hg2+, the linearity gets deviated
and rises exponentially. This nonlinearity S–V curve is due
to the coordination of the Hg2+ ion with the surface functional
groups (−NH2, −OH, −CONH2) of carbon dots. We have calculated the quenching constant (Ksv) for Hg2+ as 1.59 × 105 M–1 using the fitting equation I0/I – 1 = 0.268 + 0.0854
exp(1.862[Hg2+]), and for this fitting, the correlation
coefficient (R2) is obtained as 0.998.
The detection limit is calculated using a lower concentration of the
linear portion of the curve and the detection limit for Hg2+ is found to be 168.8 ppb. Detailed calculations are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). The detection
limit and linear response range for Hg2+ detection are
compared with other various reported methods and listed in Table 1. This lower detection
limit and lower linear response range reveal the high sensitivity
of CQD-Tb materials toward Hg2+ detection.

2.4 Selectivity Analysis
We have also
performed the same PL quenching experiment in the presence of different
metal ions such as Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and so forth. The presence of different metal
ions with a 3 ppm concentration causes very poor PL quenching, but
after addition of the same amount of Hg2+ in this mixture,
significant PL quenching occurs. Therefore, this result indicates
that our CQD-Tb composite material is highly selective toward the
Hg2+ ion, it can be selectively detected in the presence
of other metal ions, and the selectivity is about 90%. Figures 5b and 6a show the PL quenching efficiency of different individual metal
ions and also in the presence of the Hg2+ ion.

of CQD-Tb in the presence and absence of Hg2+ ions.

2.5 PL Quenching
Mechanism for Hg2+ Detection
It is seen that the
material CQD-Tb is highly
superior for selective Hg2+ detection. Initially, the presence
of 0.2 ppm of Hg2+ causes 10% PL quenching. As Hg2+ has high affinity to coordinate with the N-atom, the Hg2+ ion is attached with the surface functional groups, viz., −NH2, −CONH2 and pyridinic nitrogen of quantum
dots as shown in Scheme 1. This has also been verified by the zeta-potential value where the
zeta potential of CQD-Tb changes from −15.1 to −10.1
mV after addition of Hg2+ (Figure 6b). This indicates that the surface negative
charge of quantum dots decreases because of the attachment of Hg2+ with the surface functional group, as Hg2+ has
a strong binding affinity with the N-atom of quantum dots. PET is
possible from the electron-rich CQD-Tb to the electron-deficient Hg2+ ion, which is the possible explanation for this PL quenching
behavior in the quantum dots.

Scheme 1 Hg2+ Attachment with the
CQD-Tb Material
To explain the PET
mechanism, we have performed TCSPC measurements,
from which we have understood the relative population of the excited
states of the quantum dots in the presence and absence of Hg2+ ions. The average lifetime of CQD-Tb is obtained as 8.61 ns, but
in the presence of 2 ppm of Hg2+, the average lifetime
decreases to 6.21 ns as shown in Figure 7a. The average lifetime calculation is shown
in the Supporting Information. This decrease
in decay lifetime explains the PET process as because of the presence
of electron-deficient Hg2+, excited-state electrons are
immediately transferred to the Hg2+ state, causing a decrease
in lifetime. Figure 7b shows the band diagram of probable PL quenching in the presence
of Hg2+ ions. Therefore, after gradual addition of Hg2+ ions in the composite solution, the peak (blue) intensity
at 442 nm decreases for the PET process, but this Hg2+ ion
does not affect the transition because the Tb ion and the emission
color change from blue to green accordingly.

decay spectra of CQD-Tb in the presence
and absence of Hg2+ ions; (b) band diagram of a probable
PL quenching process of CQD-Tb in the presence of Hg2+ ions.

2.6 Detection
of Hg2+ in a Lake Water
Sample
We performed the same fluorescence quenching experiment
using lake water as lake water has different metal ions with different
micro-organisms. We collected water from Rabindra Sarobar lake, Kolkata,
India. This water was filtered using a Whatman filter paper to remove
big particles if present. Using this water, we prepared a 400 μM
Hg2+ solution and performed a similar PL quenching experiment
at pH 7. It is seen that the presence of a 3 ppm concentration of
Hg2+ causes 96% PL quenching. Therefore, our materials
selectively detect Hg2+ ions in lake water in the presence
of different metal ions and also various micro-organisms. The experimental
PL spectrum is shown in Figure S7 (Supporting Information).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have explored a technique for rapid production in
the gram scale of CQDs free from further purification using a domestic
microwave. The as-synthesized CQD-Tb nanocomposite shows dual-emission
peaks in the PL spectra. This dual-emissive CQD-Tb nanocomposite is
highly selective to detect trace amounts of Hg2+ ion in
water and the change of fluorescence color from blue to green in is
observed by the naked eye under a UV lamp in the presence of the Hg2+ ion. This nanocomposite material shows a very high quenching
efficiency of about 97% in the presence of 3 ppm Hg2+ with
a selectivity of 90% with respect to other metal ions.

4.1 Materials
Citric
acid, mercury(II)
acetate, cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate, nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate,
cadmium(II) chloride, copper(II) chloride dihydrate, iron(II) sulfate
heptahydrate, manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate, lead nitrate, zinc(II)
sulfate heptahydrate, sodium chloride, and sodium hydroxide were purchased
from Merck, India. p-Phenylenediamine was purchased
from Loba Chemie, and terbium(III) chloride and dialysis bags (1 kDa)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All reagents were of analytical
grade and used without further purification. Milli-Q water was used
for all the experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of CQD
Citric acid (0.8
g) and 0.1 g of p-phenylenediamine are dissolved
in 1.2 mL Milli-Q water. The solution is heated in a domestic microwave
oven at 800 W for 50 s. The solidified dark colored sample is then
cooled to room temperature and dissolved in 20 mL of Milli-Q water
and sonicated for 2 min. After sonication, a white glossy solid is
separated from the solution because of coagulation of carbon dots
in the acidic medium. The residue is filtered and washed with Milli-Q
water and dried. Finally, the material is dissolved in 0.1 N alkaline
water and used without further purification.

4.3 Synthesis
of the CQD-Tb Composite
To synthesize Tb-containing CQD (CQD-Tb),
8 mg of carbon dots is
dissolved in 4 mL of alkaline water. TbCl3 (4.2 mg) is
dissolved in 4 mL of carbon dot solution, and the pH is adjusted to
pH 7 by using NaOH solution followed by addition of 2 mg of sodium
citrate as shown in Scheme 2. The solution is then stirred at 80 °C for 3 h, then
cooled to room temperature, and dialyzed through a 1 kDa dialysis
bag overnight to remove all free ions.

NICOLET MAGNA IR 750 system. The XPS is investigated using an OMICRON-0571
system. The zeta-potential measurement was carried out using a Malvern
instrument. The PL spectra are measured by a PTI fluoromax QM-400
spectrofluorometer using a quartz tube with a 1 cm path length. The
UV–vis absorption spectra are recorded using a Cary UV 5000
spectrophotometer. The time-resolved PL measurements of carbon dots
