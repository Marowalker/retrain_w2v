Twenty-three combretastatin
A-4 (CA-4) analogues were synthesized
by judiciously incorporating a functional N-heterocyclic motif present in Celecoxib (a marketed drug)
while retaining essential pharmacophoric features of CA-4. Combretastatin-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
hybrid analogues, i.e., 5-trimethoxyphenyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazoles
with a variety of relevantly substituted aryls and heteroaryls at
1-position were considered as potential tubulin polymerization inhibitors.
The cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated using MCF-7 cells.
Analog 23 (C-23) was found to be the most active among
the tested compounds. It showed pronounced cytotoxicity against HeLa,
B16F10, and multidrug-resistant mammary tumor cells EMT6/AR1. Interestingly, C-23 displayed significantly lower toxicity toward noncancerous
cells, MCF10A and L929, than their cancerous counterparts, MCF-7 and
B16F10, respectively. C-23 depolymerized interphase microtubules,
disrupted mitotic spindle formation, and arrested MCF-7 cells at mitosis,
leading to cell death. C-23 inhibited the assembly of
tubulin in vitro. C-23 bound to tubulin
at the colchicine binding site and altered the secondary structures
of tubulin. The data revealed the importance of (trimethoxyphenyl)(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
as a cis-restricted double bond-alternative bridging motif, and carboxymethyl-substituted
phenyl as ring B for activities and interaction with tubulin. The
results indicated that the combretastatin-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
hybrid class of analogues has the potential for further development
as anticancer agents.

Introduction
Microtubules
are dynamic polymers that form the structural framework
of eukaryotic cells. The dynamic microtubules form a spindle during
mitosis, which guides the sister chromatids to the
equatorial plane.1 A perturbation of the
dynamicity of microtubules
halts chromosome separation and causes the cells to arrest at
mitosis leading to apoptosis. Because microtubules play essential
roles during the cell division, they are considered as drug targets
for the treatment of various diseases.2 Presently, several antitubulin agents are being used
for the treatment of several types of cancers,
neurological diseases, and fungal and parasitic
infections. Antitubulin agents such as paclitaxel, vinblastine, and
epothilones are being successfully used as anticancer
agents.3,4 In addition to being
antimitotic, some of the antitubulin agents also possess vascular
disrupting5,6 and antiangiogenic properties.7 These antivascular
agents can disrupt the existing tumor vasculature and inhibit
blood vessel formation thereby rendering the tumor devoid of nutrition.
One such remarkable microtubule-targeting agent is combretastatin
A-4 (CA-4).8

CA-4 is a stilbenoid
phenol, isolated from the African bushwillow
tree, Combretum caffrum(9) It binds to tubulin and induces microtubule depolymerization.
It acts as a potent antimitotic agent and also exhibits vascular disrupting
property.10,11 CA-4 is reported to be poorly soluble in
water.12 To overcome this limitation, many
water-soluble prodrug forms of CA-4, such as 3-O-phosphate derivative (CA-4P, Zybrestat)13 and a serine amino acid conjugate (AVE8062)14 have been developed. At present,
combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA-4P),13,15 the phosphate
form of the prodrug, in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel is
in phase III clinical trials for anaplastic thyroid cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier NCT00507429).
Further, several phase I and
phase II clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifiers NCT01423149, NCT00968916, NCT00977210, NCT00960557,
NCT01560325) were completed for CA-4P and its analogues against different
types of tumors.16−19 In addition, a synthetic phosphorylated prodrug of combretastatin
A-1, Oxi450317,18 is presently undergoing phase
I/II trials in combination with Cytarabine for acute myelogenous leukemia
and myelodysplastic syndromes (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier NCT02576301).

Owing to its important pharmacological
features and simple structure,
CA-4 serves as a potential lead molecule for the generation
of new anticancer compounds. The structure–activity relationship
studies of CA-4 and its analogues has revealed the importance of the
syn-orientation of rings A and B and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl as ring
A for antitubulin activity/cytotoxicity.20,12 Although several combretastatin derivatives are under clinical investigations,
their stability is a major concern. CA-4 undergoes isomerization of
the double bond of stilbene from cis-isomer (active)
to trans-isomer (inactive) in physiological conditions
and in the presence of heat, light, or protic media.21,22 The binding of trans-CA-4 to tubulin
leads to structural distortions of the bound molecule, which can be
the most likely cause of its reduced activity in comparison with its
cis-form.23 To circumvent
the issue of cis-to-trans-isomerization, various CA-4 analogues
have been explored via the incorporation of heterocyclic,24,25 carbocyclic,26,27 and functional bridging groups28−31 as a replacement for the double bond. We have reported one such
analog, compound 12,32 which was found
to show more potent antiproliferative activity than CA-4.

Nowadays,
the preparation of hybrid compounds
that possess important skeletons present in drugs/clinical agents
has become an important research area for medicinal chemists.33,34 This can be an effective approach to possibly avoid physicochemical/pharmacokinetic/toxicity
problems that appear in the later stages
of development.35,36 Celecoxib is a cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) inhibiting anti-inflammatory drug. Currently,
USFDA has approved it for the treatment of breast, colon, and urinary
cancers. Celecoxib inhibited the growth of human endometrial,
gastric, and prostate carcinomas37,38 and was also found to display chemopreventive
effect against lung cancer in former smokers.39 These unique features of celecoxib incited us to suitably blend
its skeleton with CA-4 to
generate a new molecular motif as a potential
antitubulin agent (Figure 1). The assembly of a trifluoromethyl substitution,
a pharmacologically and physicochemically important functionality,40 and a pyrazole motif41 can provide additional hydrogen bond acceptors
and donors (via water molecules) for interaction with tubulin. In
the investigated 1,5-diaryl-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
series of compounds, the 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl motif in ring A and
a variety of relevant aryls
and heteroaryls as ring B were considered. In addition,
a compound that mimics the diaryls of CA-4 was also synthesized.

of novel 1,5-diaryl-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazoles.

In this work, we have evaluated the cytotoxicity
of the synthesized
compounds against MCF-7 cells. Among the compounds
tested, C-23 displayed most potent antiproliferative
activity against MCF-7 cells. The cytotoxic effect of C-23 against different types of cancer cells including the multidrug
resistant cancer cells as well as on noncancerous cells was determined.
Further, we have characterized the antiproliferative mechanism of C-23. In addition, the structural features of the compounds
along with their antiproliferative activity have been discussed.

Results
and Discussion
Chemistry
A
1,5-diarylpyrazole scaffold is usually constructed
via cyclocondensation of 1,3-dicarbonyl with hydrazine.42 Utilizing this method, preparation of our designed
compounds, 5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazoles
with various aryl and heteroaryls at 1-position require (hetero) arylhydrazines
as starting substrates. However, these hydrazines are difficult to
prepare43 and are limited in commercial
availability.
Moreover, in our investigation, this approach42 involving the cyclocondensation reaction of (Z)-4,4,4-trifluoro-3-hydroxy-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)but-2-en-1-one
with 4-methoxyphenylhydrazine provided the desired 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole in low yield (38%).
Moreover, an undesired product, regioisomeric N-arylated
pyrazole, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole, was also obtained in considerable
quantity (15% yield). Therefore, this approach was considered
to be nonconvenient. 1,5-Diarylpyrazoles were also previously prepared
via transition-metal (Pd,44 Cu,45,46 Fe47,48)-mediated N-arylation of
preformed 1H-pyrazoles. For the preparation
of targeted compounds, 5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
(IV) as the precursor for N-arylation was
considered (Figure 2). The reaction of hydrazine hydrate with enol intermediate (III) prepared by a reported method49 of Claisen–Schmidt transformation produced pyrazole IV.42

of investigated compounds. Substrates, reagents, and conditions: compound IV (1 mmol), RBr (2equiv), CuI (5 mol %), DMEDA (20 mol %),
K2CO3 (2.1 equiv), 1,4-dioxane (anhyd, 2 mL),
110 °C. Yield for maximum conversion in optimum time.

In this approach, pyrazole IV was
obtained in one
pot with an overall 60% yield. A method for cupric acetate–mediated N-arylation of pyrazoles with arylboronic acid is known
in the literature.50 The reaction for N-arylation of 5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
(IV) with 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid using this method
was performed. However, incomplete conversion,
poor regioselectivity (N1- vs N2-arylation), and low
yield were observed. Investigating varied reaction conditions
did not improve the conversion and yield (Table S1).We
then investigated N-arylation of pyrazole IV by the Ullmann–Golderg coupling method.45 The reaction with 4-bromoanisole by CuI
catalysis was performed to prepare the targeted diarylpyrazole. The
desired 1,5-diaryl regioisomer was formed in 15% yield. An
optimization study was then carried out (Tables S2 and S3). Various ligands known
for N-arylation reactions were evaluated. The bidentate
ligands proved to be superior to monodentate ligands
in terms of conversion, regioselectivity, and yield of desired product.
Next, copper catalysts were examined. In general, Cu (I) catalysts
(Cl, Br, I, OTf) were found slightly better than other tested Cu(II)
catalysts. CuI was found to be best. With DMEDA ligand
and CuI catalyst, gratifyingly, the desired 1,5-regioisomer was obtained
in 93% yield. Moreover, the optimized conditions enabled us to reduce
the production of undesired regioisomeric N-arylated
product (1,3-diaryl) in trace quantity (4% yield only). With the optimized
protocol in hand (Figure 2), a series of investigated compounds (1–23) with relevant substitutions were
synthesized. Several substituted aryls and heteroaryls important
for displaying potential tubulin polymerization inhibitory
activity were considered in ring B. Compound 3 that exactly
mimics the diaryls in CA-4 was synthesized from compound 21 by Pd–C catalyzed hydrogenative debenzylation. All
the products were identified by 1H and 13C NMR,
IR and HRMS spectroscopies. Single crystal X-ray crystallographic
analysis of
compound 1, as a representative example, confirmed the
1,5-regioisomer, a desired cis-restricted pyrazole analog of combretastatin
(Figure S1). HPLC study of all synthesized compounds
indicated the purity >95%.

Biological Studies
Screening
Antiproliferative Activity of Combretastatin Analogues
in MCF-7 Cells
Using sulforhodamine
assay,51 the synthesized combretastatin
analogues (1–23) were
screened for their antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 (human breast
cancer) cells (Figure 3). Compound 23 (C-23) was found to be the
most potent antiproliferative agent among the tested compounds. Hence,
the antiproliferative activity of C-23 was further characterized
and its mechanism of action was elucidated.

of the antiproliferative activity of combretastatin analogues in MCF-7
cells. The percentage inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation by 1
μM CA-4 analogues was determined. The assay was performed four
times. Error bar represents standard deviation.

Effects of C-23 on the Proliferation of Different Types of Cancer
Cells
The antiproliferative activity of C-23 was tested against various cancer cell lines. C-23 inhibited
the proliferation of MCF-7, B16F10 (mouse skin cancer), HeLa (human
cervical cancer), and EMT6/AR1 (multidrug drug-resistant
mouse mammary cancer) cells
with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.3 ± 0.8, 6 ± 0.6, 5.5 ± 0.6, and 14.7
± 0.3 μM, respectively
(Table 1 and Figure S50).

a The data represent an average ±

Effects of C-23 on Noncancerous
Cells
To determine
the cytotoxic potential of C-23 in noncancerous cells,
the effect of C-23 was evaluated against normal epithelial
human breast cells (MCF10A)
and normal fibroblast mouse skin cells (L929). The
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of C-23 against MCF10A was determined to be 23.2 ± 0.8 μM, which is
∼18 times more than its IC50 value in MCF-7 (1.3
± 0.8 μM) (Table 1 and Figure S50). Also, the IC50 of C-23 against L929 was 14 ± 1 μM, ∼2 times more than
its IC50 value in B16F10 (6 ± 0.6 μM) (Table 1). The results indicated
that C-23 displayed
low toxicity in noncancerous cells compared to the cancer
cells used in the study. Though the low toxicity of the investigated
compound against noncancerous cells is encouraging, tubulin-targeting
agents are known to show several side effects including neurotoxicity.

Effects of C-23 on Microtubule Depolymerization in MCF-7 Cells
Perturbation of cellular microtubules is one of the characteristic
morphological changes associated with antitubulin compounds. Control
interphase cells displayed an intact organization
of microtubules with distinct filaments (Figure 4a) whereas C-23 treatment depolymerized interphase microtubules
in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4a). Further, C-23 depolymerized spindle microtubules
and disrupted the chromosome organization (Figure 4b). Vehicle treated MCF-7 cells exhibited
regular bipolar spindles required
for proper chromosome segregation
during metaphase. C-23 exposure disrupted the bipolar
astral formation of spindles leading to the formation of either one
or many astral bodies at the spindle poles (Figure 4b). In Figure 4b, the upper panel
shows that the chromosomes are properly aligned
at the metaphase plate in the control cells. However,
in the C-23 treated cells, the chromosomes were pulled
closer to the centrosomes toward each pole (Figure 4b, middle panel). In C-23 treated monopolar cells, the metaphasic plate was not
properly formed and the chromosomes were centered at the pole near
the centrosome (Figure 4b, lower panel). The results indicated that C-23 caused spindle defects in cells, leading to missegregation and misalignment
of chromosomes at the metaphase
plate. In addition, we quantified the level of polymer/soluble tubulin
in C-23 treated MCF-7 cells. The polymer to soluble tubulin
levels was decreased by 52 and 62% in the presence
of 3 and 6 μM C23 indicating that C-23 depolymerized microtubules in cells (Figure 4c,d).

(lane 4) was used as a positive control. The experiment was performed
four times. Shown is a representative blot. (d) Polymer and soluble
level of tubulin quantified using ImageJ software and the ratio of
polymeric/soluble tubulin was plotted. Error bar represents standard
deviation. **p < 0.01 indicates statistical significance
of the data.

C-23 Caused Mitotic Block
and Induced DNA Damage in MCF-7 Cells
The perturbation of
mitotic microtubules and improper formation
of metaphase plate led us to hypothesize that the antiproliferative
properties of C-23 were due to its ability
to induce mitotic arrest. To test this, the effect of C-23 on cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cells was determined by flow
cytometry (Figure 5a and Table 2). The
flow cytometric analysis revealed
that 10 ± 2, 31 ± 9, and 46 ± 8% of the cells were
accumulated at the G2/M phase when treated with either vehicle or
3 and 6 μM C-23, respectively (Table 2). The results indicated that C-23 arrested cells at the G2/M phase. Further, the mitotic
index (percentage of cells in mitosis) was determined
to be 5 ± 2, 23 ± 4, and 43 ± 5 in the absence and
presence of 3 and 6 μM C-23, respectively, showing
that C-23 blocks the cells at mitosis (Figure 5b,c and Table 2).

in each case.

It is well-known
that a prolonged arrest in mitosis leads to induction
of DNA damage in cells.52 We therefore
ought to find out the effect of C-23 on DNA damage in MCF-7 cells. Phosphorylation
at Ser139 of H2AX (γ-H2AX) at the site of double-stranded
breaks (DSBs) is a typical marker used to examine DNA damage in cells.53,54 DNA damage in C-23 treated cells was determined by
evaluating phosphorylation (γ-H2AX) of histone-2AX (H2AX) by
immunofluorescence microscopy. MCF-7 cells were treated with 3 and
6 μM C-23 and processed for immunostaining using
γ-H2AX antibody. DNA was stained with Hoechst. The level of
phosphorylation of H2AX (γ-H2AX
intensity) in C-23 treated cells was higher compared
to that of the untreated (control) cells, indicating that C-23 produced DNA damage in MCF-7 cells (Figure 6a,b).

Figure 6 C-23 induced
DNA damage in cells. (a) MCF-7 cells were treated with vehicle and
3 and 6 μM C-23 for 36 h and were fixed and processed
for immunostaining using γ-H2AX IgG to stain double-stranded
DNA breaks (pink). DNA was stained using Hoechst 33258 (blue). The
scale bar is 20 μm. (b) The γ-H2AX intensity was calculated
using ImageJ software and plotted. The experiment was performed three
times and 100 cells were scored for intensity calculation in each
case. Error bar represents standard deviation. **p < 0.01 indicates statistical significance of the data.

C-23 Induced PARP Cleavage
and Apoptosis in MCF-7 Cells
To determine whether C-23 could induce cell death in
MCF-7 cells, we performed a live and dead assay using flow cytometry.
MCF-7 cells were treated without and with 3 and 6 μM C-23 for 48 h and the cells were processed for flow cytometry
after incubating with propidium iodide (PI). As shown in Figure 7a,b, 2 ± 1,
52 ± 2, 78 ± 5, and 83 ± 6% of the total cells were
found to be dead/apoptotic when treated with vehicle
or 3 and 6 μM C-23 and 15 nM vinblastine, respectively
(Table 3).

Figure 7 C-23
treatment caused PARP cleavage and induced cell death in MCF-7 cells.
(a) Flow cytograms show live and dead cells after PI staining. MCF-7
cells were incubated without and with C-23 (3 and 6 μM)
for 48 h. Fifteen nanomolar vinblastine was used as a positive control.
Representative images from three experiments are shown. (b) The percent
of live and dead cells was quantified and plotted. The error bar shows
standard deviation. **p < 0.01 indicates statistical significance of the data.
(c) C-23 cleaves PARP in MCF-7 cells. Cells were treated
with vehicle and 3 and 6 μM C-23 for 48 h. Cell
lysate for each sample was prepared, and PARP cleavage was determined
by Western blot using anti-PARP-1 IgG. Actin was used as a loading
control. Fifteen nanomolar vinblastine was used as a positive control.
The experiment was performed three times. A representative blot is
shown.

a Data were

The cleavage
of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a well-known
indicator of apoptosis in cells.54,55 Therefore,
we determined whether C-23 treatment could induce PARP cleavage in
MCF-7 cells. Immunoblot analysis of MCF-7 cells treated without
and with 3 and 6 μM C-23 for 48 h indicated that C-23 activated PARP,
as evident by the cleavage of PARP (Figure 7c). Vinblastine
(15 nM) was used as positive control. The results indicated
that C-23 treatment induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.

C-23
Inhibited Polymerization of Purified
Tubulin
The assembly
kinetics of tubulin is known to be perturbed by antitubilin agents.
As C-23 depolymerized the cellular microtubules, we ought
to find out its effect on in vitro tubulin polymerization.
Purified tubulin was incubated in the absence and presence of different
concentrations of C-23 and the effect of the compound
on the polymerization of tubulin was monitored by turbidimetry. C-23 inhibited tubulin assembly in a concentration-dependent
manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 39 ± 3
μM (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 C-23 bound
to purified tubulin and inhibited its polymerization. (a) Tubulin
(13 μM) was polymerized in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) (■)
and 10 (●), 20 (▲), 40 (▼), 60 (◀), and
75 (▶) μM C-23. The kinetics of tubulin
assembly was monitored at 350 nm. The
experiment was performed three times. One of the independent sets
is shown. (b) Electron micrographs of DMSO-induced tubulin polymers
polymerized without (control) and with 20 μM C-23 are shown. The scale bar is 0.5 μm. (c)The elution profile
of tubulin (20 μM) (□) and C-23 (60 μM)
(Δ) when loaded individually onto the column are shown. Tubulin
(20 μM) was incubated with C-23 (60 μM) in
25 mM PIPES at 25 °C for 30 min and then eluted through the same
column. The elution profile of tubulin (■) and C-23 (▲) of the tubulin-C-23 complex is shown. The
experiment was performed two times.

In addition, the electron micrographs of tubulin polymers
were
obtained by polymerizing tubulin in the presence of only vehicle DMSO
(control) or with 20 μM C-23 (Figure 8b). The
electron micrographs showed that C-23 perturbed the formation
of tubulin polymers. In the absence of C-23, several
polymers were observed per
microscopic field, most of which were long and straight. In the presence
of 20 μM C-23, few short polymers were observed
per microscopic field supporting the turbidimetry data that C-23 inhibits tubulin assembly in vitro.

C-23 Bound to Purified Tubulin in Vitro
To check if C-23 interacts with pure tubulin, we performed
size exclusion chromatography.
Tubulin (100 kDa), C-23 (436.4 Da), and a mixture
of tubulin and C-23 was separately loaded onto a P4 resin
column. Tubulin and C-23 when loaded individually eluted
at 1.5 and 7.5 mL of elution volume, respectively (Figure 8c). When the mixture of tubulin
and C-23 was loaded onto the same column, tubulin was
eluted at 1.5 mL as a single peak and C-23 was eluted
in two different elution volumes, one peak at 1.5 mL and another peak
at 7.5 mL, suggesting that C-23 coeluted with tubulin.
The result indicated that C-23 can form a complex with
purified tubulin.

C-23 Perturbed the Secondary Structure of
Tubulin
The
effect of C-23 on the secondary structure of tubulin
was monitored by far-UV CD
spectroscopy. An analysis of the CD spectra of tubulin indicated that
tubulin contains 49 ± 2% helix,
21 ± 2% sheets, and 28 ± 3% turns and random coils (Figure 9a,b). The observed
secondary structure content was found to be similar to the reported
crystal structure of tubulin (PDB ID: 5LYJ). A significant decrease in the α-helical
content of tubulin was observed when incubated with C-23 (Figure 9a). The
α-helical content decreased from 49 ± 2% to 47 ± 2%,
and 44 ± 2% when treated with 6 and 10 μM C-23, respectively. Also, a significant increase in the random coil structure
was observed as it increased from 13 ± 2% to 16 ± 1% and
18 ± 2% in the presence of 6 and 10 μM C-23, respectively indicating that the binding of C-23 disrupts
the secondary structures of tubulin (Figure 9b).

Figure 9 C-23 disrupted
the secondary structure of purified tubulin. (a) Tubulin (1 μM)
was incubated with vehicle (DMSO) (■) and 6 (●) and
10 (▲) μM C-23. The far-UV CD spectra were

C-23 Bound to Tubulin at
the Colchicine Binding Site
Antitubulin agents perturb microtubule
assembly dynamics by binding
to tubulin at three different sites, namely, the vinca binding
site,56 colchicine binding site,57 and taxol binding site.58 Combretastatins
are known to interact with tubulin by binding at the interface
of the tubulin dimer specifically at the colchicine site.59 As C-23 is an analog of CA-4, we
hypothesized that it will also bind at the colchicine site on tubulin.
To test this hypothesis, a
competitive assay of C-23 with colchicine was carried
out. When excited at 350 nm, colchicine exhibits low fluorescence
in aqueous solution whereas a significant increase in
the fluorescence intensity
with a fluorescence maxima at 440 nm is observed when
it is bound to tubulin.60 The preincubation
of C-23 with tubulin led to a reduction in the development
of fluorescence of tubulin–colchicine
complex in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 10a). This
indicated that C-23 impedes the binding
of colchicine to tubulin. The inhibitory constant (Ki)
of C-23 for colchicine was determined to be 2.2 ±
0.5 μM (Figure 10b).

Figure 10 C-23
bound at the colchicine binding site on tubulin. (a) Tubulin (5 μM)
was incubated in the absence (■) and presence of 2 (●),
5 (▲), 7 (▼),
10 (◀), 12 (▶), 15 (◆), and 20 (⬟) μM C-23. Then the mixtures were incubated with 5 μM colchicine
for 45 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence spectra (410–500
nm) were monitored using 350 nm as the excitation wavelength. (b) C-23 reduced the fluorescence intensity of tubulin–colchicine
complex. One of the three independent sets is shown. (c) Tubulin (5
μM) was incubated in the absence (■) and presence of
5 (●), 10 (▲), 20 (▼), 30
(◀), 40 (▶), and 50 (◆) μM C-23. The mixtures were incubated with 5 μM C-12 for 10 min at
37 °C, and the fluorescence spectra (410–550 nm) were
monitored using excitation wavelength 350 nm. One of the three independent
sets is shown. (d) The percentage inhibition of the tubulin-C-12 fluorescence
was plotted against C-23 concentration. The error bar
indicates standard deviation.

Similarly, a competitive assay of C-23 with C-12 was performed. C-12 is an analog of CA-4 and is known to bind at the colchicine
site in tubulin.32 On binding to tubulin, C-12 fluoresces with
maximum fluorescence intensity at 450 nm. C-23 decreased
the binding of C-12 to tubulin in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 10c,d),
indicating that C-23 binds at the
combretastatin binding pocket as that of C-12.32 The results together suggested that C-23 binds to tubulin at the colchicine site.

Analysis
of C-23 Binding Site on Tubulin by Molecular Docking
Using
molecular docking, a putative binding site for C-23 in
tubulin dimer was investigated. To validate the docking results,
DAMA-colchicine and CA-4 (Figure 11a,d) were docked on tubulin dimer (PDB ID: 5LYJ). The docked conformations
of DAMA-colchicine and CA-4 were found to be at the interface of the
tubulin dimer (Figure 11b,e). The docked conformation
of DAMA-colchicine and CA-4 was then compared with the PDB coordinates
of their respective X-ray crystallographically determined structures,
1SA057 and 5LYJ,23 respectively.
The RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) between the docked
conformation and the crystal structure of the molecules was estimated
to be 1.6 and 1.1 Å for DAMA-colchicine and CA-4,
respectively (Figure 11c,f). A RMSD value less than 2–3 Å indicates an appropriate
docking.61 Thus, a similar docking protocol
was used to elucidate the binding site of C-23 in tubulin.

Figure 11 DAMA-colchicine
and CA-4 docked at the interface of the tubulin
dimer. The color scheme for α-tubulin is dark red, for β-tubulin
is cyan, for DAMA-colchicine (crystal structure) is orange
red, for DAMA-colchicine (docked) is olive green, for CA-4 (crystal

and tubulin are in stick and ribbon representations, respectively.
Sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms are depicted as yellow,
white, red, and dark blue sticks, respectively. (a) Crystal structure

binding energy was found to be docked at the interface of the dimer.
(c) RMS deviation between the crystal structure and docked conformation
of DAMA-colchicine. The coordinates of the docked DAMA-colchicine
(olive green) were superimposed over the X-ray crystallographically
determined coordinates (orange red). (d) Crystal structure of CA-4
in sticks. (e) Docked conformation of CA-4 at the interface of tubulin

found to be docked at the interface of the dimer. (f) RMS deviation
between the docked and crystal structure of CA-4 obtained by superimposing
the docked CA-4 (orchid pink) over the crystallographically determined
coordinates (green).

A docking analysis of C-23 (Figure 12a) suggested that C-23 binds
to tubulin at the colchicine-binding pocket (Figure 12b). On superimposing the docked conformations
of C-23, CA-4, and DAMA-colchicine,
it was observed that both CA-4 and C-23 overlapped
with DAMA-colchicine, indicating that they bind to the colchicine
binding pocket (Figure 12c and d).

Figure 12 C-23
docked at the colchicine binding pocket on the tubulin
dimer. The color scheme for α-tubulin is dark red, for β-tubulin
is cyan, for C-23 is yellow, for DAMA-colchicine (docked)
is olive green and for CA-4 (docked) is orchid pink. The compounds
and tubulin are in stick and ribbon representations,
respectively. Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and fluorine atoms
are depicted as white, red, dark blue, yellow, and light green sticks,
respectively. (a) Structure of C-23 in sticks. (b) Docked

The conformation of C-23 with the lowest binding energy
was found to be docked at the interface of the dimer (c) Docked conformation
of C-23 overlapped with docked conformations of DAMA-colchicine
and CA-4. All the three compounds were shown to occupy the same binding
pocket. (d) Zoomed view of (c) showing overlapped C-23, CA-4, and DAMA-colchicine.

The colchicine-binding pocket mostly consists of hydrophobic
amino
acids, and therefore, the site is hydrophobic in nature. An analysis
of the residues lying within a 4 Å distance from
the docked conformation of C-23 indicated that the binding
pocket is mostly constituted of hydrophobic residues (Figure 13). Most of the
residues present in the binding pocket of C-23 were also
found to be present in the binding pocket of CA-4 and DAMA-colchicine.
Further analysis indicated that several common hydrophobic residues
were present in the vicinity of all the three compounds and thus may
provide possible hydrophobic
interactions (Table 4).

acid residues of the tubulin dimer present within 4
Å distance of C-23. Residues of α-tubulin and β-tubulin
are shown in dark red and cyan sticks, respectively. C-23 is in yellow stick representation.
The color scheme for the atoms is same as in Figure 12. The
black line represents the possibility of a hydrogen bond between C-23 and the amino acid present in its binding pocket. C-23 was found to have possible hydrogen bonds with Thr179A
(3.10 Å), Asp248B (3.41 Å), and Lys251B (1.80 Å).

a Residues
in bold are the common
residues found in the binding pocket of DAMA-colchicine, CA-4, and C-23.

In
addition, a close look at the binding pocket
of docked C-23 revealed possible hydrogen
bonding interactions. The distance between the ester-methoxy oxygen
of C-23 to the amide hydrogen
of Lys251B was measured to be 1.80 Å (Figure 13), indicating
a hydrogen bond between them. Another possible hydrogen
bond was observed between the hydrogen of pyrazole moiety of C-23 and carbonyl oxygen of Thr179A as the distance
between them was 3.10 Å (Figure 13). Further, a weak hydrogen bond
of bond length 3.41 Å (Figure 13) was observed between the oxygen atom
of carboxyl ester group of C-23 and amide hydrogen of
Asp248B. These hydrogen bonding interactions
are possibly involved in stabilizing C-23 in the binding
pocket along with other hydrophobic interactions. Similarly, possible
hydrogen bonds of DAMA-colchicine and CA-4 with tubulin were also
measured and analyzed (Table 5).

a The binding energies
were estimated
by Autodock 4.2 and the lengths of the hydrogen bonds were measured
using UCSF Chimera version 1.11.

Using the Autodock software, the binding energy for C-23, CA-4, and DAMA-colchicine interaction with tubulin was estimated
to be −8.5, −7.50, and −10.43 kcal/mol, respectively,
indicating that C-23 may bind to tubulin with a greater affinity than CA-4 (Table 5). The biochemical
competitive binding data and the docking analysis together strongly
suggested that C-23 binds to tubulin at the colchicine-binding
site.

Structure–Activity Relationship
The present
series of compounds involves the 3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
as bridging scaffold, trimethoxyphenyl motif as
ring A, and varied substituted
aryls and heteroaryls as ring B. The IC50 values (Table 1) and
antiproliferative activity of C-23 indicated important
structure–activity relationship. The presence of methoxy, trifluoromethoxy,
benzyloxy, dimethoxy, dioxomethylene, methoxy-benzyloxy,
and methoxy-hydroxyl in the aryls (ring B) exhibited low
to moderate antiproliferative activities. The presence of quinoline
or 2-methylquinoline as ring B in molecules displayed low and moderate
antiproliferative activity, respectively. This observation
is in contrast to our earlier finding of combretastatin-2-aminoimidazole
analog that possesses quinoline as ring B and exhibited
potent antiproliferative activity. The ring B motifs such as the aryls
containing chloro, fluoro, and acetyl, and the heteroaryls including
thiophene, pyridine, and indole displayed good activities. (Trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
derivative (C-23) that possesses carboxyl ester-substituted
phenyl as ring B was found to be most active and showed potent antiproliferative
activity against various cancer cells, MCF-7, HeLa, B16F10, and
EMT6/AR1.The ester-methoxy oxygen and oxygen of carboxyl ester provides
important hydrogen bonding interactions with Lys251B and Asp 248B,
respectively. The presence
of carboxyl ester functionality in the aryl ring B (which is
known to be amenable) of this most active and new combretastatin-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
analog is interesting and useful.

Conclusion
In
an attempt toward overcoming disadvantages including instability
and trans-isomerization susceptibility of the Z-double bond of CA-4
and analogues/derivatives, a new series of heterocyclic compounds
was designed. It involved a blend of the structural features of the
clinical agents and a marketed drug celecoxib, recently approved for
treatment of various cancers. The compounds consisted of 3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole
as the bridging motif replacing
the double bond of CA-4, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl group in ring A and
various relevant (hetero)aryls in ring B. For the synthesis
of these compounds, a convenient method with high regioselectivity
and yield was developed. Twenty-three compounds with relevantly substituted
aryls and heteroaryls were prepared. All the compounds were tested
against MCF-7 cells and C-23 was found to be the most
effective antiproliferative agent. C-23 also showed significant
inhibitory activity against several other cancer cells including
the drug-resistant EMT6/AR1cells. Interestingly, C-23 showed substantially weaker cytotoxicity toward noncancerous cells
than the cancer cells indicating the anticancer potential of the compound.
Although several of the tubulin targeting agents have been successfully
used in cancer chemotherapy, toxicity, and development of resistance
limit their applications. Altered isotype compositions, mutations
in the drug binding site and drug efflux are thought to be the major
causes of the development
of drug resistance.2−4In vitro experiments showed that C-23 binds to tubulin at the colchicine site and the binding
of the compound disrupts the secondary structure of tubulin. It inhibited
tubulin polymerization both in cells and in vitro and interfered with the cell cycle progression by arresting the
cells at mitosis leading to cell death by apoptosis.

in 100% DMSO. For the screening, MCF-7 cells were grown in a 96-well
cell culture plates at a density of 1
× 104 cells/well.54 Then,
the cells were grown in the presence of 1 μM
concentration of all the CA-4 analogues for 48 h. The inhibition

dishes and incubated with vehicle and 3 and 6 μM C-23 or 15 nM vinblastine for
48 h. After the required incubation, cells were collected and immunoblotted
using specific antibodies for PARP-1 and β-actin
as described earlier.62 The blots were

× 104 cells/mL, and then, the cells were incubated
without or with 3 and 6 μM C-23 for 36 h. The cells
were processed and immunostaining was performed using specific antibodies
as described earlier.62 For microtubule staining, anti-α tubulin antibody
was used and DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 dye.
To determine DNA damage, cells were stained with anti-γ-H2AX

culture dishes and incubated with either vehicle or 3 and 6 μM C-23 for 36 h for cell cycle analysis and 48 h for live–dead
assay. After the incubation, cells were processed for flow cytometry
using PI.

Isolation of Polymer/Soluble
Mass of Tubulin
The polymer and soluble levels
of tubulin in cells was quantified
using an assay modified from Giannakakou et al.65 In brief, MCF-7 cells were treated with 3 and 6 μM C-23 for 36 h and then lysed in a hypotonic buffer solution
of 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), and 10 μL/mL protease
inhibitor (Thermofisher scientific). The supernatant containing soluble
tubulin and the pellet containing polymerized tubulin were separated
by centrifugation at 14000g for 15 min. The pellet
fraction was lysed with GST-cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 200 mM
NaCl, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.6) and centrifuged to collect
the polymeric fraction of tubulin. The protein
concentration of the soluble and polymeric fractions were measured
by the Bradford method.66 Immunoblotting
was performed using the antibody specific for α-tubulin,
and the blot was developed as described above. The tubulin band intensities
were measured using ImageJ software.

In Vitro Tubulin Polymerization Assay
Purification of tubulin
from
goat brain was done by two cycles of polymerization and depolymerization
using 1 M glutamate.67 The purified tubulin
was checked for its purity using Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained
SDS-PAGE and its concentration was determined by Bradford method.66

Tubulin (13 μM) was suspended in
PEM buffer [50 mM piperazine–N,N′-bisethanesulfonic acid (PIPES) of pH
6.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA] and incubated
without and with 10, 20, 40, 60, and 75 μM C-23 for 15 min on ice. DMSO (10% v/v) was added to the reaction mixtures,
followed by the addition of 1 mM GTP (guanosine-5′-triphosphate).
The reaction mixtures were then immediately transferred to a Multiplate
reader Spectramax M2 preheated at 37 °C and the kinetics of tubulin
assembly was monitored at 37 °C by measuring turbidity at 350
nm for 45 min. Reaction mixtures containing tubulin and different
concentrations of C-23 in the absence of DMSO and GTP were used as
a control. The final spectra were calculated by subtracting the spectra
of control from the respective reaction
mixtures.

Electron Microscopy Analysis
Tubulin
(13 μM)
was polymerized in the absence
and presence of 20 μM C-23 in PEM buffer containing
10% DMSO and 1 mM GTP for 15 min at 37
°C as described above. The protein polymers formed were then
loaded on Formvar carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh) for 45 s and
blot dried. The grids were then washed with Milli-Q water
and stained with 2% uranylacetate68 for
45 s, dried, and observed under an electron microscope (JEM 2100 ultra
HRTEM) at 200 kV.68

Gel Filtration
Chromatography
Tubulin
(20 μM) was incubated
with C-23 (60 μM) in 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) at 25
°C for 30 min. Tubulin, C-23, and a mixture of tubulin
and C-23 were individually
loaded onto a P4 resin column pre-equilibrated with 25
mM PIPES. The protein was eluted using 25 mM PIPES and elution fractions
of 250 μL each were collected. The
presence of tubulin in the fractions was determined by Bradford method
and C-23 was detected by monitoring its absorbance at
400 nm.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
Tubulin (1 μM)
was incubated without or with (6 and 10 μM) C-23 in 1 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 25 °C for 30 min. Far-UV
CD spectra (195–260 nm) were measured in a CD spectrophotometer
(JASCO J-1500) using a quartz cuvette of 0.1 cm path length.69 Each spectrum was an average of three continuously
measured spectra. The data were analyzed by CDPro software and CONTINLL,
CDSSTR, and SELCON3 programs were used to predict the content of secondary
structures.70

Inhibition of Colchicine
Binding to Tubulin by C-23
Tubulin (5 μM)
was incubated without or with 2, 5,
7, 10, 12, 15, and 20 μM C-23 in 25 mM PIPES (pH
6.8) for 30 min at 37 °C. Colchicine (5 μM) was then added
to the reaction mixtures and
incubated for further 45 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence
spectra (410–500 nm) were recorded by exciting the mixtures
at 350 nm in a 0.3 cm path length cuvette using a spectrofluorometer
(FP-6500 JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence spectra of colchicine
without and with different concentrations
of C-23 were measured and subtracted from the respective
spectra of the test samples. Under the experimental conditions, C-23
displayed extremely low fluorescence and it did not change in the
presence of tubulin. The inner filter effect correction of the observed
fluorescence intensities was performed
as described earlier.69

The change
in the fluorescence intensity of the tubulin–colchicine complex
in the presence of C-23 was calculated and Ki value was determined using71  where Ki is the
half-inhibitory concentration of C-23, the concentration
of C-23 required to inhibit the binding of colchicine
by 50%, EC50 is the value at which the fluorescence intensity
is reduced by 50% in the presence of C-23, [L] is the
concentration of C-23, and Kd is the dissociation constant
of binding of colchicine to tubulin. The value of Ki was determined
by using Graph Pad Prism 6 software.

Inhibition of C-12 Binding
to Tubulin by C-23
Compound 12 (C-12) binds to tubulin at
the colchicine binding pocket.32 Tubulin
(5 μM) was incubated without or with 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and
50 μM C- 23 in 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) for 30 min
at 37 °C. Subsequently, 5 μM C-12 was added to the reaction mixtures
and incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C.
Fluorescence
spectra from 410 to 550 nm were then recorded by exciting the mixtures
at 350 nm.32 The fluorescence spectra of C-12 without and with above concentrations of C-23 were measured and subtracted from the respective reaction
sets. Inner filter effect correction of the observed fluorescence
intensities was done.69

Molecular
Docking
To examine the binding site of C-23 on
tubulin, C-23 was docked on tubulin crystal
structure using molecular docking software Autodock 4.2.72 The crystal structure
of tubulin (PDB ID: 5LYJ)23 was used as a template and was modified
prior to docking. The coordinates of chain A, B, stathmin-like domain,
tubulin–tyrosine ligase, CA-4, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid, AMP-PCP, and glycerol were deleted from the crystal structure
using PyMOL73 resulting in αβ
tubulin dimer along with GTP, GDP, two magnesium atoms, and one calcium
atom. PDB coordinates for C-23 were obtained from the
PRODRG server.74 To verify the docking parameters,
docking of DAMA-colchicine and CA-4 on the tubulin
dimer was individually performed. The PDB coordinates of DAMA-colchicine
and CA-4 were obtained from their PDB structures 1SA0 and 5LYJ, respectively. The
resulting docked conformation of DAMA-colchicine and CA-4 was then
superimposed with the PDB
coordinates of their respective crystal structures
to measure RMSD. As the docking parameters were verified
by docking of known ligands, a similar approach was used for the docking
of C-23 on the tubulin dimer. At first, a blind docking75 of C-23 on tubulin dimer was performed
by covering the entire protein surface in a grid box of 126 ×
126 × 126 Å with spacing kept at 0.785 Å. Ten independent
docking jobs were run keeping tubulin as a rigid and C-23 as a flexible molecule.
Docking was carried out using default parameters of the Lamarckian
genetic algorithm. A total of 100 runs were carried out keeping the
maximum number of energy evaluation as 2
500 000, i.e., medium. Ten cycles of 100 runs yielded 1000 conformations,
which were then clustered into clusters of RMSD 4.0 Å. The maximum
number of conformations was found to be at the interface of the dimer.
So, local docking was carried out at the dimer interface.

For
the local docking, a grid box of 98 × 92 × 78 Å was
made with spacing kept at 0.375 Å, which covered the interface
of the αβ tubulin dimer. A total of 50 independent docking
jobs were carried out using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm. A total
of 50 cycles of 100 runs resulted in 5000 conformations, which were
clustered in clusters of 4.0 Å.76 All
the clusters were analyzed and compared on the basis of the cluster
size and the binding energy, which was calculated by Autodock 4.2
scoring function. The docked conformation with the least binding energy
was considered to be a probable binding conformation. The interaction
of the compounds with tubulin was further analyzed using UCSF Chimera
version 1.11.77
