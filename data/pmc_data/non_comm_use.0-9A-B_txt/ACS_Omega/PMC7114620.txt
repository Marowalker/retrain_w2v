CO2 emission from flue gas is an important issue threatening
human survival. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which have many unique
properties, have been studied for CO2 capture. However,
water can be absorbed by DESs during the absorption of CO2, which may increase the energy cost during the desorption of CO2. In this work, a new kind of hydrophobic functional DES formed
by polyamine hydrochloride and thymol was synthesized and used for
CO2 capture. It had been found that these DESs could efficiently
capture CO2 even at low partial pressures. The CO2 capacity of [TEPA]Cl-thymol (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) was high up to 1.355
mol CO2/mol DES at 40 °C and 101.3 kPa. Interestingly,
these DESs were still hydrophobic after saturated with CO2. The CO2 absorption capacity increased with a decrease
of temperature and an increase of CO2 partial pressure.
Regeneration results showed that no obvious loss in the capacity could
be found after five absorption/desorption cycles of these DESs. The
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra indicated that CO2 could interact with amino in the DESs by the formation of carboxylate.
Moreover, the equilibrium constant and Henry’s law constant
in chemical absorption and physical absorption were studied.

Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2), mainly emitted from the burning
of fossil fuels and energy-related processes in the industry, is one
of the major greenhouse gases.1,2 CO2 in flue
gas with contents up to 10–15 vol %3 poses a direct threat to the environment and human health. Therefore,
it is important to develop recyclable absorbents to capture CO2 from flue gas with high capacity and low volatility.

In commercial processes, amine solutions are the most commonly
used reversible solvents for CO2 capture.4 Considering the economic and environmental problems, such
as the corrosion of equipment, the loss of amines, and high energy
cost during the recovery process,5 new
solvents with low volatility and energy cost should be developed.

Ionic liquids (ILs), which have many unique properties, such as
high thermal stability, negligible vapor pressure, high CO2 capacity, and adjustable structure,6 are
good candidates for CO2 absorption.7−13 Normal ILs,14−16 which only have physical interaction with CO2, can hardly be used for CO2 capture from flue
gas. Functional IL for CO2 absorption was first reported
by Davis et al.,8 and the CO2 capacity could reach almost 0.5 mol CO2/mol IL at 22
°C and ambient pressure. In recent decades, more and more functional
ILs were synthesized, such as amine-based ILs,17,18 imidazole-based ILs,19,20 and carboxyl-based ILs.21 Functional ILs have high CO2 capacity
even under low CO2 partial pressures, but some disadvantages
still exist, such as high viscosity, complicated synthesis process,
and high cost.

Recently, deep eutectic solvents (DESs), mainly synthesized by
hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD), have been
widely investigated in CO2 capture.22−29 DESs have similar properties to ILs and can avoid some defects of
ILs. Normal DESs could achieve high CO2 absorption by physical
dissolution at high CO2 partial pressures.23,30,31 Choline chloride-based (ChCl)
DESs could absorb CO2 at high CO2 partial pressures,
and the solubility of CO2 in phenol-ChCl DES (nphenol/nChCl = 2:1) could
reach up to 0.18 mol CO2/mol DES at 40 °C and 503
kPa. However, the solubility decreased greatly to just 0.0033 mol
CO2/mol DES at 122 kPa. To capture low-partial-pressure
CO2 with high capacity, functional DESs were investigated.
Cui et al.25 reported that functional DESs
made up of [P2222][Triz] as an HBA and ethylene glycol
(EG) as an HBD exhibited a high CO2 absorption capacity
of 0.91 mol CO2/mol DES for [P2222][Triz]-EG
DES (n[P2222][Triz]/nEG = 1:2) at 25 °C and ambient pressure. In our previous
work, functional DESs with polyamine hydrochloride as an HBA and EG
or DG as an HBD were synthesized.32 Among
the DESs, [TETA]Cl-EG DES (n[TETA]Cl/nEG = 1:3) had an excellent CO2 capacity
of 1.456 mol CO2/mol DES at 40 °C and ambient pressure.

As we know, moisture exists in flue gas with the contents of 8–20
vol %.33−35 During the capture of CO2, moisture in
flue gas can also be absorbed by DESs. Hydrophilic DESs can absorb
a large amount of water during the capture of CO2,36 which can greatly reduce the mass absorption
capacity in the absorption process and lead to high energy consumption
in the CO2 desorption process. Therefore, it is necessary
to synthesize and use hydrophobic DESs to capture CO2 from
flue gas. Nowadays, hydrophobic DESs have been used in many fields,
such as liquid–liquid microextroextraction37−40 and gas–gas separation.41,42 Zubeir et al.41 synthesized hydrophobic
DESs using decanoic acid (DecA) as an HBD and five different quaternary
ammonium salts as an HBA to absorb pure CO2. As no functional
group existed in the DESs, the capacity of CO2 in the DESs
was very low under low pressures, just 0.015 mol CO2/mol
DecA-[N8888]Cl DES (nDecA/n[N8888]Cl = 1.5:1) at 35 °C and 0.09 MPa
as an example. However, due to only physical interaction between CO2 and these normal hydrophobic DESs, these DESs cannot be used
for CO2 capture from flue gas.

To capture CO2 from flue gas and decrease energy cost,
a novel kind of hydrophobic functional DES, as shown in Figure 1, was synthesized and used
for CO2 capture in this work. Polyamine hydrochloride,
which has more than one free amino and can be used as an HBA, may
chemically capture CO2 under low CO2 partial
pressures. Thymol, which has a phenolic hydroxyl group and is slightly
soluble in water, could be used as an HBD. Our results indicated that
these DESs could be used to absorb CO2 with high capacity,
up to 1.355 mol CO2/mol DES in [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) at 40 °C and ambient pressure. Even if the partial pressure
decreased to 10.1 kPa, the capacity of CO2 could still
reach 0.592 mol CO2/mol DES in [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) at 50 °C. Interestingly, these hydrophobic functional
DESs were always hydrophobic during CO2 absorption. The
decrease of temperature and increase of partial pressure could enhance
the capacity of CO2 in DESs. These DESs could be reused
several times with no obvious change. Based on the Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra, the mechanism for absorption was proposed,
and the equilibrium constant and Henry’s law constant in chemical
absorption and physical absorption were calculated.

Results and Discussion
Miscibility of DESs with Water
The solubilities of
water in [TETA]Cl-thymol DESs and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DESs before and
after CO2 absorption were measured and are shown in Table 1. The solubilities
of water in [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES
(n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) were 0.051 and 0.062 g/g DES, respectively. This indicated
that these DESs were hydrophobic.

[TEPA]Cl	 	1.1631	 	1.10 × 104	 	 	 	
Interestingly, these DESs were still hydrophobic after being saturated
with CO2. After CO2 absorption, the solubilities
of water in [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES
(n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) were 0.053 and 0.069 g/g DES, respectively. This means that
absorbed CO2 hardly changes the water solubility in the
DESs, even if a new chemical bond between DES and CO2 may
be formed.

Compared with the reported work,32 [TETA]Cl-EG
DES and [TETA]Cl-DG DES are two kinds of hydrophilic DESs, but [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES is a kind of hydrophobic DESs. This means that thymol may play
a key role on the hydrophobicity of DESs.

Volatility and Physical Properties of DESs
Figure 2 shows the weight
losses of [TETA]Cl-thymol (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and [TEPA]Cl-thymol (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) at
100 °C. It was found that the weight losses of these DESs could
be ignored. The weight losses of [TETA]Cl-thymol (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and
[TEPA]Cl-thymol (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) were only 0.41% and 0.02% for 6 h at 100
°C, respectively. Moreover, [TEPA]Cl-thymol DESs (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) showed
lower volatility than [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3). The low
volatility of these DESs may be attributed to the hydrogen bonding
between an HBA and an HBD and is an excellent property for the application
of these DESs.

Figure 2 Weight ratio of [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES
(n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) as a function of time at 100 °C and a N2 flow
of 40 mL/min.

The density and viscosity of these DESs were also investigated.
It can be seen from Table 1 that the density and viscosity of [TETA]Cl and [TEPA]Cl were
very high. But when the DESs were formed with the addition of thymol,
both the density and viscosity of the DESs decreased. For example,
the viscosity of [TETA]Cl was 1.18 × 103 mPa·s, but the viscosity of [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:5) was just 69.1 mPa·s. The viscosity of [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:5) was about 16 times lower than pure [TETA]Cl.

Effect of n[HBA]/n[HBD] on CO2 Absorption in DESs
The
decrease of viscosity also enhanced the mass transfer of CO2 in an absorbent and then decreased the equilibration time of the
absorption. The effect of nHBA/nHBD on CO2 absorption in DESs is
shown in Figure 3.
Compared with pure [TETA]Cl or [TEPA]Cl, the addition of thymol could
greatly shorten the absorption time to reach equilibrium. For example,
the CO2 capacity in pure [TETA]Cl was only 0.584 mol/mol
absorbent at 50 °C and ambient pressure in 14 h. After the absorption,
the absorbent was almost in a solid state, and the viscosity could
not be measured. However, when thymol was added in [TETA]Cl to form
[TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3), the capacity of CO2 in DES could reach up to 1.282 mol CO2/mol absorbent
in 4 h. The viscosity after the absorption was just 6.77 × 103 mPa·s. Obviously, thymol could decrease the viscosity
of [TETA]Cl via forming a DES, which enhanced the mass transfer of
CO2 in absorbent and shortened the time to reach equilibrium.

mole ratios of [TETA]Cl or [TEPA]Cl to thymol at 50 °C and 101.3
kPa.

However, the addition of thymol in DESs played a negative role
on the absorption capacity of CO2. It could be seen that
thymol could not enhance the capacity of CO2 in DESs as
EG.32 Conversely, the increase of thymol
in DES could decrease the capacity of CO2. For example,
the mole capacity of CO2 decreased from 1.339 mol CO2/mol absorbent in [TEPA]Cl-thymol DESs (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) to
1.183 mol CO2/mol absorbent in [TEPA]Cl-thymol DESs (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:7).

As reported in previous work, the addition of acid in ionic liquids
or solvents could decrease the capacity of acidic gases in ionic liquids
or solvents.43,44 As we know, thymol is a weakly
acidic substance, which has a phenolic hydroxyl group. This may be
the reason why the addition of thymol could decrease the capacity
of CO2 in DESs.

Effect of Temperature and Partial Pressure on CO2 Absorption in DESs
Temperature is an important issue for
gas capture. Figure 4 shows the effect of temperature on the absorption of CO2 in [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) at ambient pressure. It could be found that both the CO2 capacity and the equilibration time decreased with increasing
temperature. For example, CO2 absorption capacity decreased
from 1.298 to 1.135 mol CO2/mol DES in [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3), when the temperature increased from 40 to 60
°C. Meanwhile, the equilibration time decreased from 9 to 4 h.

[TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3), solid symbol; [TEPA]Cl-thymol
DES (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3), hollow symbol.

As the content of CO2 in flue gas is very low, it is
necessary to study the capacity of CO2 under different
partial pressures by DESs. CO2 capacities in [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) as the
function of time with different CO2 partial pressures are
shown in Figure 5.
The CO2 capacity in DESs decreased with decreasing CO2 partial pressure. However, even when the CO2 partial
pressure decreased to 10.1 kPa, these DESs still had very high CO2 capacity. Taking [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3), for example,
the CO2 absorption capacity decreased from 1.282 mol CO2/mol DES at 101.3 kPa to 1.047 mol CO2/mol DES
at 50.6 kPa, as shown in Table 2. Importantly, the capacity could keep 0.592 mol CO2/mol DES, when the CO2 partial pressure decreased to 10.1
kPa, close to that in flue gas. The CO2 absorption performance
in [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES was similar to that in [TETA]Cl-thymol DES.
These above results suggested that these DESs could be regenerated
by increasing the temperature and/or decreasing the CO2 partial pressure.

Reuse of DESs
The reuse of these DESs played a key
role in the application of these DESs in industry, and the results
of the reuse of these DESs are shown in Figures 6 and 7. All these
DESs could be reused for five cycles with no obvious capacity loss.
For example, the mole ratios of CO2 to [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) were 1.282, 1.224, 1.222, 1.216, and 1.218 for
five cycles during the absorption of CO2 at 40 °C
and 101.3 kPa. CO2 could be released from [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) easily
at 100 °C under N2 as sweeping gas.

Comparation with Other Hydrophobic ILs and DESs
The
summarization of hydrophobic ILs and DESs is shown in Table 3. As can be seen, the capacities
of CO2 in [TETA]Cl-thymol and [TEPA]Cl-thymol DESs are
much higher than those ILs and DESs reported in the references.

Absorption Mechanism
As mentioned above, these DESs
can capture a large amount of CO2 even under low CO2 partial pressures. The molar ratio of CO2 in [TETA]Cl-thymol
DES can reach up to 1.282 at 50 °C and 101.3 kPa, close to the
ideal stoichiometric ratio of CO2 chemical absorption in
[TETA]Cl, 1.5:1. It is noted that the ideal chemical capacity of CO2 in [TETA]Cl is 0.5 mol CO2/mol free amino. The
high capacity of CO2 in DESs demonstrates that not only
physical interaction but also chemical interaction exists between
DESs and CO2. The increase of viscosity after the absorption
of CO2 also hints that new chemical bonds appear during
the absorption, and the chemical interaction is much stronger than
physical interaction.45

The FT-IR
results in Figure 8 show the change of [TETA]Cl-thymol DES before and after CO2 absorption. Comparing the FT-IR spectra before and after CO2 absorption, a new peak appears at 1641 cm–1 after CO2 absorption, which can be attributed to the
formation of N···C=O. This means that chemical
interaction exists between the amino group and CO2. In
addition, there are strong peaks at 1330 and 1584 cm–1, which are associated with the formation of carboxylate −COO– in DES.32,46 This means that CO2 captured by DES formed carboxylate with DES.

Figure 8 FT-IR spectra of (a) [TETA]Cl-thymol DES and (b) CO2-absorbed [TETA]Cl-thymol DES.

Based on the results above, the free amino group in [TETA]Cl may be the main reason for CO2 absorption by the DES. As no chemical bonds can be found between
thymol and CO2, thymol may only physically absorb CO2 during the absorption. The absorption mechanism in this work
may be similar to the previous one.32,47 A possible
mechanism of CO2 absorption by these DESs is proposed and
shown in Scheme 1.
For the chemical absorption, one mole free amino in DESs can chemically
capture 0.5 mole CO2.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Reaction of CO2 and Amino in
DESs
R1 and R3 stand for H or alkyl chains, and R2 and R4 stand for alkyl chains.

As both physical and chemical interactions exist during the absorption
of CO2 in DESs, the absorption of CO2 in these
DESs is the sum of the chemical and physical contributions. Therefore,
the total capacity in DESs can be divided into chemical capacity and
physical capacity, as shown in eq 1. There are equilibrium constant and Henry’s
law constant in chemical absorption and physical absorption, respectively,
at a certain temperature. 1  where n is the total mole
ratio of CO2, nphys is the
physical capacity of CO2, and nchem is the chemical capacity of CO2.

For physical absorption, the capacity of CO2 in DES
obeys Henry’s law, as shown in eq 2. 2  where P is the partial pressure
of CO2, H is Henry’s law constant,
and xB is the mole fraction of CO2.

As proposed above, one mole CO2 can react with two moles
of free amino in DESs. To simplify Scheme 1, we represent the free amino component in
DES as “A” and the CO2 component as “B”,
which reduces the scheme to the following equation 3  Then, the equilibrium constant, Kθ, is calculated by the following equation 4  where aA2B and aA are the activities of
the A2B complex and A, respectively; fBV is the fugacity of B in the vapor phase; Pθ is the standard pressure; γA2B and γA stand for the activity
coefficients of the A2B complex and B, respectively; and CA2B and CA are the molar concentrations of the A2B complex and A,
respectively. Due to the similar property to ILs, the activity coefficients
of DES are reasonably assumed to be 1 as of ILs.48 Then, eq 4 leads to eq 5. 5  where C0 is the
initial molar concentration of free amino and Ct is the equilibrium molar concentration of free amino, which
can be obtained by eqs 6 and 7. 6   7  where V and V′ are the volumes of absorbent before and after absorption,
respectively. As there is no obvious volume change of absorbent before
and after absorption, it is reasonable to assume that V and V′ are equal. To simplify the calculation, fBV can be considered as equal to P.

Based on eqs 1, 2, 4–6, the following equation is obtained to relate the total solubility
of CO2 in DES to the partial pressure of CO2. 8  There are two parameters, H and Kθ, in eq 8, which should be calculated. These parameters
can be obtained by fitting the experimental capacity at different
CO2 partial pressures. The fitting curve for CO2 capacity in [TETA]Cl-thymol DES at 50 °C is shown in Figure 9. The experimental
data show excellent agreement with the calculated data. The fitted
parameters, H and Kθ, are 648 kPa and 1.073, respectively, with the correlation coefficient R2 larger than 0.9999. The physical and chemical
capacities of CO2 in [TETA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TETA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) at
50 °C are also calculated and shown in Table 2. As expected, the absorption capacity of
CO2 is contributed from both physical and chemical absorptions.
Chemical absorption is dominate, while physical absorption is minor.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of hydrophobic functional DESs based on polyamine
hydrochloride as an HBA and thymol as an HBD were synthesized to absorb
CO2 from simulated flue gas. Miscibility with water and
the physical properties of DESs before and after the capture of CO2 were measured. Besides, the effects of the mole ratio of
HBA to HBD, temperature, and CO2 partial pressure on the
capture of CO2 in the DESs were studied. It was found that
these DESs were always hydrophobic before and after the capture of
CO2, and the increase of thymol in DESs could decrease
the viscosity and density of DESs. All these DESs could capture large
amounts of CO2 from simulated flue gas, and the capacity
of CO2 in DES could reach up to 1.355 mol CO2/mol DES in [TEPA]Cl-thymol DES (n[TEPA]Cl/nthymol = 1:3) at 40 °C and 101.3
kPa. Decreasing temperature and increasing partial pressure could
enhance the capture of CO2. The results of FT-IR indicated
that CO2 could chemically interact with amino in DESs by
the formation of carboxylate. Moreover, the equilibrium constant and
Henry’s law constant in chemical absorption and physical absorption
were studied. It was found that both physical and chemical absorptions
contributed to the total absorption capacity of CO2.

Experimental Section
Materials
CO2 (99.999%) and N2 (99.999%) were obtained from Beijing Haipu Gases (Beijing, China).
Triethylenetetramine (TETA, 70% in an aqueous solution) and tetraethylpentamine
(TEPA) (98%) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Thymol
(99%) was purchased from Maclin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).
Hydrochloric acid (36–38%) was obtained from Beijing Chemical
Plant (Beijing, China).

Preparation of DESs
[TETA]Cl was synthesized by a reaction
between an aqueous solution of TETA and an equimolar amount of hydrochloric
acid as reported in literature.32 After
the reaction, water was removed by a rotary evaporator at 80 °C.
And then, the crude product was purged with the continuous nitrogen
of 40 mL/min at 100 °C for more than 48 h, until the mass ratio
of water in [TETA]Cl was less than 0.005. [TETA]Cl was mixed with
thymol in an expected molar ratio at 100 °C, and then nitrogen
was bubbled into the mixture for 20 min to remove the impurities in
the DES. The prepared DES was then stored in a desiccator. The synthesis
process of other DESs was the same as the above one.

Volatility of DESs
The volatility of DESs was investigated
by measuring the weight loss of the DES under sweeping gas at 100
°C. In a typical experiment, about 2 g of DES was loaded in a
test tube (φ15 × 150 mm). Then, nitrogen gas with a flow
rate of 40 mL/min was bubbled into the DES to remove volatile compounds.
The weight of the test tube and the DES were measured at a regular
interval by an analytical balance (BS 224S, Sartorius) with an accuracy
of 0.1 mg. The DES retained in the test tube could be calculated by
subtracting the weight of the test tube from the total weight of the
test tube and DES.

Properties of DESs
The density of DESs was measured
by a 5 mL pycnometer and calibrated with pure water before the experiment.
Using a temperature controller (A2 type, Beijing Changliu Scientific
Instrument Co., Ltd., China), the temperature was maintained at a
constant-temperature water bath with an uncertainty of ±0.1 °C
to control the experimental temperature. All measurements were performed
at least three times. The uncertainty of the density measurement was
estimated to be ±0.0002 g/mL. The viscosity of DES was measured
by a gravity capillary viscometer operated by Shanghai Shenyi Glass
Instrument Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) in the same water bath. The
temperature was controlled in the same manner as described above.
The absolute viscosity (η) of DES was calculated from the viscometer
constant, the operation time, and the density of the liquid. The uncertainty
of the viscosity measurement was estimated to be ±2%.

Mass Ratio of Water in DESs
The mass ratio of water
in DESs was determined by Karl Fischer titration (ZDJ-400S, Multifunctional
Titrator, Beijing Xianqu Weifeng Company, Beijing, China). The expanded
uncertainty of water mass ratio was ±6.8% at the mass ratio of
water = 10–3. To learn the miscibility of DESs with
water before and after the absorption, water was added into the test
tube contained DESs before or after CO2 absorption, until
two phases appeared in the test tube. Then, the mass ratio of water
in the upper phase was measured by Karl Fischer titration.

Absorption and Desorption of CO2
The absorption
and desorption of CO2 were carried out at ambient pressure
in a constant temperature water (or oil) bath, which was controlled
within ±0.5 °C. In a typical absorption experiment, about
2 g of DES was loaded in a test tube (length 100 mm, inner diameter
15 mm). CO2 gas with a flow rate of 40 mL/min at ambient
pressure was bubbled into the DES in a glass tube, which was partially
immersed in a constant-temperature water bath (the uncertainty was
±0.5 °C). The CO2 absorption capacity was measured
at regular intervals by an analytical balance with a precision of
0.1 mg. For the absorption, if CO2 partial pressure was
less than 101.3 kPa, pure CO2 was diluted by N2 to reduce the partial pressure of CO2. The CO2 desorption experiment was conducted using the same absorption device,
and only the bubbled gas was changed to pure N2.
