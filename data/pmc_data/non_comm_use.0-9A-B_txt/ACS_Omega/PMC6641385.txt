This
work demonstrates the improved stability of zinc oxide nanorods
(ZnO NRs) for the photoanode of solar water splitting under voltage
biases by the addition of borate or carbonate ions in the aqueous
electrolyte with suitable pH ranges. The ZnO NRs prepared by the hydrothermal
method are highly active and stable at pH 10.5 in both borate and
carbonate buffer solutions, where a photocurrent higher than 99% of
the initial value has been preserved after 1 h polarization at 1.5
V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) under AM 1.5G. The optimal pH
ranges with a minimum morphological change of ZnO NRs for photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting in borate and carbonate buffer solutions are
9–13 and 10–12, respectively. The working pH range for
PEC water splitting on ZnO NR photoanodes can be extended to 8.5–12.5
by the combination of borate and carbonate anions. The lifetime of
ZnO NR photoanodes can be synergistically prolonged for over an order
of magnitude when the electrolyte is the binary electrolyte consisting
of borate and carbonate in comparison with these two anions used individually.
On the basis of the experimental results, a possible mechanism for
the protective behavior of ZnO in borate and carbonate solutions is
proposed. These findings can be used to improve the lifetime of other
high-performance ZnO-based catalysts and to understand the photocorrosive
and protective behaviors of ZnO NRs in the borate and carbonate solutions.

1 Introduction
Photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting has been considered
a promising candidate for capture and high-capacity storage of solar
energy.1,2 A typical PEC cell generally consists of
a semiconductor photoelectrode in which electron–hole pairs
are generated upon light absorption. Following charge carrier separation,
electrons reduce water to hydrogen, while holes oxidize water to oxygen.
The ideal semiconductor electrode used for water splitting would require
the following: (i) a suitable width of band gap >1.23 eV (thermodynamic
equilibrium voltage) +0.8 eV to overcome kinetic barriers; (ii) the
conduction band above the H+/H2 equilibrium
potential for hydrogen evolution and the valence band below the O2/H2O equilibrium potential for oxygen evolution;
and (iii) excellent PEC and photocorrosion stability in aqueous solutions.3,4

Zinc oxide (ZnO) has attracted much attention in the past
decades
as a favorable photoanode material toward achieving efficient PEC
water oxidation because of its good electron mobility, excellent optical
properties, wide availability, and low toxicity.5,6 Recently,
nanostructure engineering of ZnO films has been shown to improve photocurrent
yields because of the large surface-to-volume ratio, which exhibits
a great advantage in the PEC water splitting for efficient delivery
of photogenerated carriers.7 Despite these
excellent properties, ZnO-based photoanodes are not commercialized
to support reliable and efficient PEC water splitting because of several
limitations. Most notably, ZnO suffers from photocorrosion in the
aqueous solution under ultraviolet illumination by hole trapping on
its surface, which is a common problem for many other candidate materials
for water splitting.8 Another very serious
issue is ZnO decomposition when the solution pH values are too low
or too high, even in dark. From the potential–pH diagram of
zinc in water,9 the predominant dissolved
zinc species in acidic to neutral and basic media between 9.2 and
13.2 are Zn2+ and Zn2+(OH)ii–, respectively. According
to previous studies,8,10,11 ZnO was chemically dissolved in acids or strong bases under potential
biases and/or UV light illumination. Decomposition of ZnO in aqueous
solutions has been proposed as the following reactions 1   2   3   4  

The chemical dissolution corresponds to the direct reaction
of
ZnO with protons and hydroxyl ions.10 The
electrochemical dissolution of ZnO generally needs an applied potential
of around 2 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).12 Accordingly, two competitive reactions for ZnO
dissolution were suggested13 5   6  

However, the dissolution rate of ZnO under illumination is
faster
than that under potential biases because of the addition of chemical
dissolution which depends on the concentration of OH–. In fact, the dissolution rate of ZnO is a function of both OH– and hole concentrations at the ZnO surface, which
are a function of both potential bias and light intensity.14 The decomposition potential is determined by
the formation of dissolved products when the electrode has been photocorroded.
The equations describing the photoinduced decomposition of ZnO are
expressed as follows15 7   8   9  

Accordingly, the lowest solubility of ZnO is
obtained at pH 9.3
(10–7 to 10–8 M),16 and the solubility increases exponentially when pH becomes
lower or higher than 9.3. Furthermore, Gerischer and Sorg17 proposed that the ZnO dissolution rate depends
on the type of anion in the solution, which was directly proportional
to the square root of the electrode rotation speed, which is attributable
to the diffusion of protons.

To overcome these issues, two parallel
paths are generally employed:
(i) development of new methods to improve the stability of ZnO for
the long-term usage in water splitting and (ii) coatings of conductive
and protective films to prevent corrosion during the PEC reaction
period.18 Recently, surface modification
of ZnO photoanodes, such as combination with another semiconductor,19−23 deposition of noble metals,24 and coupling
with versatile carbon materials,25 has
been proposed to suppress the photocorrosion to provide the long-term
performance of ZnO electrodes for the water splitting process. Moreover,
phosphate and borate buffers have been shown to enhance the rate of
oxygen evolution and improve the stability when various water oxidation
catalysts such as manganese,26 cobalt,27 or nickel oxides28 were employed. By preventing the accumulation of protons near the
anode surface, these buffers significantly increase the lifetime of
the catalysts. Fekete et al.29 investigated
the buffer effect on catalytic activity and stability of ZnO in a
12 h stability test. They found that ZnO was structurally stable in
the borate buffer solution (pH 10.5) and prolonged its lifetime during
this PEC process. However, there was no explanation for the impact
of this buffered electrolyte on the PEC stability of ZnO.

In
this work, the influence of buffer electrolytes on the zinc
oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) morphologies is investigated to understand
the buffer influences. The effects of pH in the buffered electrolytes
on the generation and stability of photocurrent are discussed. The
stability mechanism of ZnO NRs and how to extend the pH window for
improved stability of ZnO in the PEC water splitting process are proposed
in this study.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of ZnO Electrodes
ZnO
NRs on the fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass slide (FTO glass,
7 Ω sq–1) substrate were fabricated by a hydrothermal
method described in our previous study.30 A seed layer of ZnO was deposited on FTO glass by spin-coating a
solution of 10 mM zinc acetate in ethanol and subsequent calcination
at various temperatures for 2.25 h to obtain the ZnO seed layer on
FTO glass. Then, the ZnO seed layer/FTO glass was transferred to a
50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 20 mM Zn(NO3)2, 20 mM hexa-methylenetetramine, and 35 v/v %
polyethyleneimine aqueous solution for the hydrothermal reaction at
98 °C for 4 h to obtain ZnO NRs on FTO glass. ZnO NRs/FTO glass
was rinsed with ethanol and deionized water and finally dried in air
at 80 °C.

2.2 Characterization of ZnO
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a HITACHI, SU8010 FESEM
instrument with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis system
operated at 50 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained
using Bruker APEX DUO. XRD patterns were taken using Cu Kα as
the radiation source with a 1° divergence slit, 0.2° receiving
slit, and carbon monochromators at 1° min–1 (2θ range 20°–70°). Time-of-flight secondary
ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS, Munich, Germany) is used to characterize
the surface composition of the ZnO NRs on the FTO substrate. The primary
ion source was a pulsed 69Ga+ source (pulsing
current 2.5 pA and a pulse width of 30 ns) operated at 15 keV with
a post-acceleration of 10 kV. The analysis area of 100 nm × 100
nm, data acquisition time of 30 s, and charge compensation by applying
low-energy electrons (∼30 eV) from a pulsed flood gun were
used for the measurements. The mass resolution measured on the ZnO+/– signal was m/Δm = 4000 in the positive and negative detection modes. Calibration
of the mass spectra in the positive detection was based on the peaks
such as H+ (1.007 m/z), B+ (11.0082 m/z), 64Zn+ (63.922 m/z), 66Zn+ (65.919 m/z), and in the negative detection mode on C– (12.0004 m/z), O– (15.995 m/z), CO2– (44.003 m/z), HCO2– (45.0118 m/z), 64ZnO– (79.922 m/z), and 64ZnO– (81.9189 m/z).

2.3 (Photo)electrochemical
Measurement
The PEC catalytic activity of the ZnO NRs was
tested by linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution
(pH 6.8) using a potentiostat (CH Instruments 4053a) under the three-electrode
mode. The ZnO NR photoelectrode, a Pt wire, and an Ag/AgCl electrode
were employed as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.
The LSV was measured at 10 mV s–1 from −0.5
to 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl in the positive sweep direction. All PEC tests
were measured under a 75 mW cm–2 simulated sunlight
source [a xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter (Newport)]. The
measured potentials (vs Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl, Argenthal, 207 mV vs SHE
at 24 °C) can be transformed to be against the reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation31 10  where ERHE is
the transformed potential versus RHE. Accordingly, ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.609 (V)
because pH of the 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution is 6.8.

Stability performance was tested in the electrolytes with pH between
8.0 and 13.0. The electrolytes used were as follows: 0.5 M Na2SO4, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaClO4, 0.025
M borate buffers (at pH 8.0–13.0), 0.025 M carbonate buffers
(at pH 9.0–12.75), 0.05 M α-amino acetic acid (H2N–CH2–COOH, i.e., glycine), and 0.05
M phosphate buffer solution adjusted by 0.1 M NaOH and HCl solutions.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
of ZnO NRs
Figure 1a,b shows the morphology
of ZnO NRs grown on the FTO substrate, with an average diameter and
length of NRs equal to 70 nm and 1.38 μm, respectively. The
crystal phase of ZnO NRs corresponds to the standard XRD pattern of
wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS card no. 36-1451) by powder XRD analysis (Figure 1c). Obviously, facet
(002) is the main peak for all samples. Facet (100) appears at the
seed layer annealing temperature equal to 330 °C, but its intensity
decreases with the increasing annealing temperature. This result indicates
that the c-axis orientation of ZnO gradually increases
with the annealing temperature.

substrate with the seed layer annealed at (1) 300, (2) 330, and (3)
350 °C. The LSV curves were measured in 0.5 M Na2SO4 at pH = 6.8 under the AM 1.5G simulated solar light irradiation.

The PEC activity of ZnO NRs in
0.5 M Na2SO4 with pH = 6.8 was examined by LSV
which reveals that the highest
photocurrent is 0.4 mA cm–2 when the ZnO seed layer
has been annealed at 330 °C (Figure 1d). This result is attributable to the presence
of the (100)-oriented ZnO NRs which provide a superior carrier transport
path along this direction and provide a short pathway for minority
carriers to reach the interface.32 As a
result, the PEC performance of these nanostructured films is greatly
improved. On the basis of the abovementioned results and discussion,
330 °C is the seed-layer annealing temperature of ZnO NRs used
in the further studies.

3.2 Electrolyte Effects on
the Stability of ZnO
for PEC Processes
Figure 2a compares the stability of ZnO NRs biased at 1.5 V
(vs RHE) in aqueous solutions containing 0.5 M Na2SO4, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaClO4, and 0.025 M Na2B4O7. For the Na2SO4 solutions, the initial pH values were set at 6.8 and 10.5 (curves
1 and 2), while there was only one pH value (10.5) for the other electrolytes
(curves 3–5). Clearly, the chronoamperogram (CA) curves in Figure 2a show significantly
different photocurrent responses of ZnO NRs in these electrolytes,
which is indicative of different PEC behaviors. In 0.5 M Na2SO4 with pH = 6.8, the PEC activity of ZnO NRs significantly
decreases to 10% of the initial value within 30 min. The declination
in the photocurrent density is reduced when the pH value is changed
from 6.8 to 10.5 from a comparison of curves 1 and 2. From the literature,33 the minimum solubility of ZnO is between pH
9.9 and 12.3, which has been proposed to be the stable operation pH
window of ZnO. However, the PEC activity of ZnO decays significantly
within 20 min in that study. Accordingly, the chemical dissolution
of ZnO is expected to be induced by the specific adsorption of certain
anions on the ZnO surface, and zinc complexes are liable to form in
the Cl–-, ClO4–-, and
SO42–-containing solutions.33,34

CA curves of a ZnO photoanode biased at 1.5 V vs RHE in (1,2)
0.5 M Na2SO4, (3) 0.5 M NaCl, (4) 0.5 M NaClO4, and (5) 0.025 M Na2B4O7 with pH = (1) 6.8 and (2–5) 10.5. (b) CA curves of a ZnO
photoanode biased at 1.5 V vs RHE in 0.025 M (1) Na2B4O7, (2) Na2CO3, (3) glycine,
and (4) Na2HPO4 with pH = 10.5 under the AM
1.5G simulated solar light irradiation.

From a comparison of curves 2–5, the stability of
ZnO NRs
is very obviously improved in the Na2B4O7 electrolyte with pH = 10.5. More than 100% of the initial
photocurrent is preserved after the 1 h PEC test. Clearly, anions
are another important factor influencing the stability of ZnO against
photocorrosion. A few studies indicated that the PEC stability of
ZnO photoanodes in the borate electrolyte is higher than that in common
electrolytes (e.g., SO42–) under the
same pH.29 Because the borate ions with
the buffering characteristics can act as a proton/OH– donor and acceptor to compensate the proton/OH– concentration gradient because of the heterogeneous reaction between
photogenerated hole and water,35 the localized
pH value at the ZnO–liquid interface (i.e., interfacial pH)
should not be significantly changed by the oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) or OH• formation. To confirm this buffering
effect on the stability of ZnO photoanodes, the PEC stability of ZnO
NRs was further tested in various buffer electrolytes under AM 1.5G
simulated solar light irradiation (see Figure 2b). Clearly, the stability of ZnO NRs in
the glycine and Na2HPO4 solutions is worse than
that in the Na2B4O7 and Na2CO3 electrolytes because the residual photocurrents in
the former two electrolytes are equal to 74 and 30% of the initial
values in the 1 h PEC test. In addition, more than 100% of the initial
photocurrent is preserved when the ZnO NR photoanode has been tested
in the Na2CO3 solution for 1 h. Accordingly,
the mechanism for improving the PEC stability of ZnO NRs cannot be
simply attributed to the buffering effect of electrolytes, and the
highest stability of ZnO can be obtained in the Na2B4O7 and Na2CO3 electrolytes.
Note that the order of electrolytes with respect to decreasing the
initial photocurrent is as follows: Na2B4O7 (0.59 mA cm–2) > Na2CO3 (0.55 mA cm–2) > Na2HPO4 (0.32 mA cm–2) > glycine (0.22 mA cm–2). This interesting result implies that certain anions
significantly
enhance the PEC activity of ZnO NRs, probably resulting from the specific
adsorption of these anions (see below).

Typical SEM images of
ZnO NRs before and after the 1 h PEC test
in various electrolytes are shown in Figure 3. In comparison with the fresh ZnO NRs shown
in Figure 3a, the diameter
of ZnO NRs may be changed, depending on the corrosion or salt deposition
processes during the 1 h PEC test. Because of the photocorrosion occurring
in the Na2SO4 electrolyte, most ZnO NRs were
dissolved from the FTO glass substrate after the PEC test (see Figure 3b). On the other
hand, the morphologies of ZnO NRs were not significantly changed when
ZnO NRs were tested in the Na2B4O7 and Na2CO3 electrolytes from a comparison
of Figure 3a,c,d. These
results reveal the improved PEC stability of ZnO in the borate-/carbonate-containing
electrolyte, and the adsorption of these two anions may be under the
monolayer situation. The rough surface and large diameter of ZnO NRs
in Figure 3e indicate
the significant photocorrosion and redeposition of Zn–glycine
salts onto the ZnO NR surface in the glycine (an organic acid containing
the carboxylic group) solution, resulting in the decrease in the photocurrent
(see Figure 3e), although
ZnO NRs are still visible after the PEC test. When the phosphate solution
is employed, breakdown of ZnO NRs with a passive film is visible from
an examination of Figure 3f, probably resulting in the activity loss of ZnO NRs. From
the literature,36 the formation of phosphates
on the ZnO surface via eq 11 is likely to adversely affect the PEC activity of ZnO 11  

Figure 3 SEM images of (a) freshly
prepared ZnO NRs and (b–f) ZnO
NRs after the 1 h CA test at 1.5 V vs RHE under the AM 1.5G simulated

Na2CO3, (e) 0.025 M glycine, and (f) 0.025 M
Na2HPO4 electrolytes at pH = 10.5.

Moreover, the maximum concentration of HPO42– species was found in the pH range of
9 to 11.5, which could alter
the dissolution process and form a passive layer of NaZnPO4·H2O via eq 11.36 Because a tubular structure
of ZnO is clearly found in Figure 3f, the crystal plane (002) of ZnO NRs has been corroded
in the phosphate electrolyte. Because the abovementioned etching is
selective, the positively charged Zn-terminated [0001] polar surface
of ZnO is believed to donate Zn2+ to react with PO43– ions to form Zn3(PO4)2 as an insoluble salt which decreases its buffering
capacity.37 Therefore, the presence of
phosphate ions promotes the selective corrosion and declines the PEC
activity of ZnO. On the basis of the abovementioned results and discussion,
the PEC stability of ZnO can be improved by the usage of borate and
carbonate ions as the supporting electrolyte.

3.3 pH Effects
in the Borate and Carbonate Solutions
on the Stability of ZnO NRs
To further investigate the influence
of the two abovementioned anions with buffering characteristics on
the stability of ZnO for PEC water splitting, freshly prepared ZnO
NR photoanodes were further tested in the borate and carbonate solutions
at various pH values, and typical results are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The ZnO photoanodes show excellent stability in the pH range of
9 to 13 (see Figure 4). Because of the buffering effect, these two anions can release
or capture protons to maintain the localized pH value at the ZnO NR/electrolyte
interface when the PEC water splitting occurs.38 On the other hand, the interfacial pH should decrease significantly
during the PEC process when the solution pH was adjusted to be lower
than its pKa. Accordingly, decay in the
PEC activity of ZnO NRs is observed at pH = 8.7 which are lower than
the pKa of Na2B4O7 (pKa1 = 9.23).

ZnO photoanodes biased at 1.5 V vs RHE in 0.025 M
Na2B4O7 at pH = (1) 8.7, (2) 9.5,
(3) 10.5, (4) 11.0, (5) 12.0, and (6) 13.0 under the AM 1.5G simulated
solar light irradiation.

Figure 5 SEM images of ZnO photoanodes after the 1 h CA test at 1.5 V vs
RHE in 0.025 M Na2B4O7 at pH = (a)
8.7, (b) 9.5, (c) 10.5, (d) 11.0, (e) 12.0, and (f) 13.0 under the
AM 1.5G simulated solar light irradiation.

To evaluate the possible PEC activity decay mechanism, the
surface
morphologies of ZnO NRs after the 1 h PEC test in the Na2B4O7 electrolyte at various pH values are shown
in Figure 5. At pH
= 8.7, almost all ZnO NRs have been dissolved into the electrolyte,
and the FTO substrate under the residual ZnO NRs is clearly found
in Figure 5a. When
pH is 9.5, significant damages on the surface of ZnO NRs are visible,
but their PEC activity does not significantly decay in the 1 h PEC
test from Figure 4.
Therefore, the damages on the surface of ZnO NRs do not significantly
destroy the [0001] facets such as (100) and (002) which are the highly
active sites for water splitting.32,39 At pH = 10.5,
there is no change in the morphology of ZnO NRs before and after the
1 h PEC test (Figure 5c), correlating well with the high photocurrent stability over 1
h. At pH = 12, 12.5, and 13, ZnO NRs are slightly dissolved at the
side of the top surface. This result suggests that excess hydroxyl
ions adsorb preferentially onto the positively charged [0001]-Zn surface
to form the soluble zinc species, resulting in the increase of the
chemical dissolution rate when pH is higher than 12.3 (see Figure S1b–d).40 However, the PEC activity of ZnO NRs does not significantly decay,
illustrating that the (002) facet is not significantly decomposed
in the 1 h PEC test.

For the carbonate buffer electrolyte, good
stability of ZnO photoanodes
is observed at pH between 10 and 12 (Figure 6). However, the PEC activity of ZnO decays
when pH has been increased to 12.5. Accordingly, the working pH range
of ZnO in the carbonate buffer electrolyte is narrower in comparison
with the borate buffer solution. Because the carbonate buffer solution
is highly effective for stable photocurrents when the operation pH
is closed to its pKa (ca. 10.2), the suitable
operation pH range for obtaining stable photocurrents of ZnO should
be shifted with the pKa value.

Figure 6 CA curves of
ZnO photoanodes biased at 1.5 V vs RHE in 0.025 M
Na2CO3 at pH = (1) 9.0, (2) 9.5, (3) 10.5, (4)
11.0, (5) 12.0, and (6) 12.5 under the AM 1.5G simulated solar light
irradiation.

The morphologies of ZnO
NRs after the 1 h PEC test in the carbonate
electrolyte at various pH values are shown in Figure 7a–f. Obviously, there is no visible
change in the morphology of ZnO NRs when pH is between 10 and 12.
However, when pH is increased to 12.5, a passive layer of Zn(OH)2(s) with carbonate salts seems to be formed on the ZnO NR
surface via precipitation of saturated zincate ion [Zn(OH)42–], as shown in Figure 7f.41 Therefore,
the decay in the photocurrent of ZnO NRs should reasonably result
from the coverage of a passive layer which reduces the photoconversion
efficiency of ZnO NRs in such an electrolyte. Although the photocatalytic
activity of ZnO for the OER can be promoted in alkaline solutions
because of an enhanced reaction rate between OH– and holes, the dissolution of ZnO is also accelerated by the formation
of soluble zincate ions [Zn(OH)3–(aq) or Zn(OH)42–(aq) species] in concentrated alkaline solutions via eqs 3 and 4.42,43 Hence, the photocurrent density decreases when pH is higher than
10.5, implying that the rate of chemical dissolution (eqs 3 and 4) becomes
significant. In contrast, the PEC activity of ZnO NRs can be preserved
when the borate buffer electrolyte is employed. This is probably due
to the fact that the HBO32– species existing
at 12 < pH < 1444 are mainly responsible
for proton transport and reduce the concentration of hydroxyl ions
at the ZnO/electrolyte interface. Another possible reason is the formation
of the borate radical, •B(OH)4, (eqs 12–14), from the oxidation of B(OH)4– by photogenerated holes at pH > 11.5, which might oxidize water
and suppress the decomposition of ZnO NRs.45,46 12   13   14  

Figure 7 SEM images of ZnO photoanodes
after the 1 h CA test at 1.5 V vs
RHE in 0.025 M Na2CO3 at pH = (a) 9.0, (b) 9.5,
(c) 10.5, (d) 11.0, (e) 12.0, and (f) 12.5 under the AM 1.5G simulated
solar light irradiation.

We also investigated the effect of the anion concentration
on the
stability of ZnO in the 1 h PEC test. Figures S2 and S3 show that the stability of ZnO NRs in a relatively
low pH solution can be improved by the increase in the anion concentration
because of the stronger buffering capability.47 However, the ZnO NRs have been found to be covered with sodium zincate
and zinc carbonate passive layers in borate (pH 8) and carbonate (pH
9.5) solutions (see Figure S4a,b). Because
the XRD pattern of ZnO NRs with the 1 h PEC test at pH 8 in the borate
buffer electrolyte confirms no obvious change in the crystalline wurtzite
phase, the physicochemical properties of wurtzite ZnO NRs are retained,
leading to the stable photocurrent (see Figure S4c).

On the basis the abovementioned results and discussion,
the surface
species formed from the reactions between anions and ZnO are dependent
upon the solution pH, which are believed to affect the resultant photocurrent
density of ZnO NRs obtained in the borate or carbonate solutions with
different pH values. From the literature,48 the oxidation of ZnO in the buffer-containing solutions should be
diffusion-controlled by the concentration of the buffer anion at pH
lower than 12 and by the OH– concentration at pH
higher than 12. Interestingly, the photocurrent of ZnO can be preserved
at pH higher than 12 (see Figure 4); meanwhile, the morphology of ZnO NRs is not significantly
damaged after the 1 h PEC test (see Figure 5d–f). Dodd et al.49 reported that OH– could adsorb preferentially
onto the positively charged [0001]-Zn surface, increasing the reaction
rate between OH– and holes (i.e., accelerated water
oxidation). This report suggests that the PEC activity of ZnO to the
OER or OH• formation is dependent on its crystal
facet. According to the abovementioned results and discussion, the
PEC activity and morphological change of ZnO in pure NaOH solutions
at various concentrations are worthy of being investigated.

Figure 8a shows
that the order of the NaOH concentration with respect to decreasing
the photocatalytic activity of ZnO is as follows: 0.1 M > 0.01
M >
0.001 M > 0.2 M > 0.5 M. Surprisingly, the PEC activity of ZnO
can
be preserved in the 0.1 M NaOH solution (pH ≈ 12.85). On the
other hand, the photocurrent densities in such pure NaOH solutions
are obviously lower than those obtained in the borate or carbonate
electrolytes, revealing the key role of the two abovementioned anions
(probably via adsorption) in promoting the photocatalytic activity
of ZnO. When the NaOH concentrations are out of 0.01–0.1 M,
the photocatalytic activity of ZnO NRs decays significantly where
20, 70, and 30% of the initial photocurrent can be respectively preserved
in the 0.001, 0.2, and 0.5 M NaOH solutions after the 1 h PEC test.
The abovementioned results indicate that the ZnO NR photoanode is
stable when the OH– concentration is between 0.01
and 0.1 M.

Figure 8b–e
shows the morphologies of ZnO NRs after the 1 h PEC test in different
NaOH solutions. Note that ZnO NRs become thinner after the 1 h PEC
test in 0.001 M NaOH (pH ≈ 10.95), as shown in Figure 8b, suggesting the dissolution
of ZnO NRs. Figure 8c,d shows no significant change in the morphology of ZnO NRs when
the ZnO photoanodes have been tested in the 0.01 and 0.1 M NaOH media,
although part of ZnO NRs become slightly finer. Accordingly, the photocorrosion
of ZnO slightly occurs in the two abovementioned NaOH solutions. Also,
note the visible dissolution on not only the [0001] facet but also
the nonpolar [101̅0] facet. This phenomenon implies the homogeneous
dissolution of ZnO NRs, and the small diameter of NRs (<100 nm)
limits the dissolution of the top surface by a low diffusion rate.50 Because the damage of the [0001] facet is minor
in the 1 h PEC test, the photocurrent of ZnO NRs can be preserved.
However, when the NaOH concentration reaches 0.2 M, ZnO NRs collapse,
as shown in Figure S5a. One possible reason
is the formation of passive Zn(OH)2(s) (see Figure S5b) via the precipitation of saturated
zincate [Zn(OH)42–] in the vicinity of
the photoanode surface.41 Because of the
coverage of such a passive layer on the electrode surface, the [0001̅]
facet may be corroded significantly by the damage of lattice oxygen
via the photodegradation according to the following reactions51 15   16  

In the 0.5 M NaOH solution, most ZnO NRs disappear and the FTO
substrate is exposed after the 1 h PEC test (see Figure 8e), revealing the serious damage
of the ZnO NR photoanode. From all the abovementioned results and
discussion, two possible mechanisms strongly depending on the pH value
of electrolytes are proposed here to be responsible for the damage
of ZnO NRs. In the relatively low pH media (e.g., 0.001 M NaOH), the
diffusion-controlled dissolution of ZnO NRs occurs. In the high pH
solutions (e.g., 0.2 and 0.5 M NaOH), facet-selective dissolution
of ZnO NRs dominates because of the formation of a passive layer on
ZnO NRs (i.e., eqs 15 and 16).

3.4 Possible
Mechanism
The interactions
among solution pH, buffer anion, and the PEC activity/stability of
ZnO NRs are shown in Figure 9a,b. When pH is lower than the pKa value, the decay in the photocatalytic activity with the PEC testing
time is attributable to the chemical dissolution (eqs 1 and 2).
With increasing pH, the PEC activity of ZnO is enhanced by the adsorption
of relatively concentrated OH– on the active sites.
In the meantime, the local pH at the vicinity of the ZnO surface can
be leveled by the buffering agents, reducing the corrosion of ZnO
by H+. Note that a stable photocurrent can be obtained
in the borate buffer solution with pH between 11 and 13 (see curve
1 in Figure 9a), but
the photocurrent (i.e., PEC activity) reaches a maximum at pH = 10.5.
The latter result reveals that the presence of borate ions significantly
promotes the PEC activity of ZnO, probably because of the co-adsorption
of borate and hydroxyl ions. The former result is also attributable
to the co-adsorption of OH– and HBO32– on the ZnO surface, promoting the stability of ZnO
NRs. The abovementioned statements are supported by the fact that
when pH equals 13 (i.e., the OH– concentration in
the borate solution is above 0.1 M NaOH), the photocurrent density
of ZnO NRs is 0.46 mA cm–2, 30% higher than the
photocurrent density obtained in 0.1 M NaOH (0.35 mA cm–2 from Figure 8a).
In addition, the borate radical, •B(OH)4, can be formed in the aqueous solution at pH = 10.545,46 and might act as a mediator for hole transfer from ZnO to prevent
the occurrence of photocorrosion.

Figure 9 (1) Relative and (2) initial photocurrent
densities of ZnO photoanodes
biased at 1.5 V vs RHE in 0.025 M (a) Na2B4O7 and (b) Na2CO3 at various pH values.
The relative photocurrent density is the ratio between the initial
photocurrent density and the photocurrent density measured at time
equal to 60 min.

To further understand
the protection behavior of ZnO in borate
and carbonate electrolytes, the surface composition of ZnO NRs was
measured by TOF-SIMS in the positive and negative modes. Figure 10 shows the intensity
variation of characteristic ions of ZnO (64Zn+ and 66Zn+), borate (B+), and carbonate
(CO2– and CHO2–) as a function of pH. From Figure 10a, the intensity of characteristic ions of ZnO is close
to 1 at the pH 9.5, 12, and 13, indicating that the construction of
ZnO may not be changed after the 1 h PEC test. The intensities of 64Zn+ and 66Zn+ are increased
when the pH is 8.7, indicating a change in the chemical structure
of the ZnO NR surface by PEC corrosion. However, the decrease in the
intensity of 64Zn+ and 66Zn+ is clearly found when pH is 10.5. This phenomenon is attributable
to the adsorption of borate anions [B(OH)4–] on the ZnO NR surface, as shown in Figure 10b. Such adsorbed borate ions reasonably
act as a mediator for hole transfer from ZnO to promote the water
oxidation and prevent the occurrence of photocorrosion. In the carbonate
electrolyte, the intensities of characteristic ions of ZnO shown in Figure 10c are higher than
1, indicating that photocorrosion occurs when the solution pH is below
10. However, when pH is higher than 12, a decrease in the intensity
is found. Figure 10d shows that the adsorption of carbonate ions results in the formation
of the carbonate salt on the ZnO surface. As a result, the coverage
of the carbonate salt can reduce the contact surface area between
ZnO and the electrolyte, leading to the decrease in the PEC activity
of ZnO, corresponding to Figure 9b. The presence of carbonate ions in the borate electrolyte
is reasonably attributed to the dissolution of CO2(g) from
the atmosphere.

and (d) carbonate (CO2– and CHO2–) for ZnO NRs after the 1 h CA test at 1.5 V vs
RHE under the AM 1.5G simulated solar light irradiation in 0.025 M
(a) borate and (c) carbonate electrolytes as a function of pH.

On the basis of the literature41,45,46,52 as well as the abovementioned
results and discussion, the photocorrosive and protective processes
of ZnO as a function of pH in both borate and carbonate buffer solutions
are simply proposed as the scheme shown in Figure 11. There are several key features of the
reaction scheme. First, the dissolution of zinc oxide is attributable
to both chemical and PEC reactions to form zinc salt complexes on
the electrode surface. Second, the buffering agents can level the
variations in H+ or OH– concentrations
at the electrode/electrolyte interface (e.g., the electrical double-layer
region) to maintain desired pH values to stabilize the photoanode.
Third, the adsorbed anions, for example, B(OH)4– or CO32–, can work as a hole mediator
to promote the water splitting reaction and suppress the photocorrosion.
Fourth, the formation of the zincate salt can protect the ZnO NRs
but results in the passivation of ZnO when the amount of carbonate
ions is too high in the high pH range (see Figure 11b). The abovementioned phenomena should
take place in the borate and carbonate buffer solutions when their
pH values are significantly lower or higher than their respective
pKa values.

Figure 11 Schemes describe the
photocorrosive and protective processes of
ZnO NRs as a function of pH in the (a) borate and (b) carbonate solutions.

To further confirm the idea that
the stability of ZnO NRs can be
improved by the usage of borate and carbonate electrolytes for the
PEC water splitting, ZnO NR photoanodes were further examined in the
relatively long-term PEC test, and the corresponding SEM images are
shown in Figure S6. After the 12 h PEC
test, the PEC activity of ZnO NRs decays slightly, where 92 and 91%
of the initial photocurrents can be preserved in the borate and carbonate
solutions, respectively. When the PEC time was prolonged to 24 h,
the photocurrents of ZnO NRs were found to decrease to 70 and 80%
of their initial photocurrents (see Figure S6a). Note that the morphologies of ZnO NRs shown in Figure S6b,c were not significantly changed after the 24 h-PEC
test, which confirmed the improved stability of ZnO NRs in the borate
and carbonate electrolytes.

3.5 Stability of ZnO in the
Binary Borate–Carbonate
Solution
Here, the combination of borate and carbonate anions
is proposed to improve the stability and PEC performance of ZnO NRs
in the solar water splitting process. This idea is demonstrated by
the PEC activity of ZnO NRs in the mixed electrolyte with various
pH values in the 1 h PEC test. As shown in Figure 12a, curves 1 and 2 show that the most stable
photocurrent density (around 0.4–0.5 mA cm–2, significantly larger than the maximum photocurrent density obtained
in the pure NaOH solution) can be obtained in the mixed electrolyte
with pH between 8.5 and 12.5. Accordingly, the suitable and working
pH range for ZnO in solar water splitting is obviously extended by
the combination of borate and carbonate ions. When pH is lower than
8.5 or higher than 12.5, decay in the photocurrent has been found.
Moreover, the SIMS analysis of carbonate and borate anions from the
ZnO surface (curves 1 and 2 in Figure 12b) shows that the adsorbed B+ and CO32– contents increase when pH
is changed from 8.3 to 10.5. This result confirms that both borate
and carbonate anions can promote the PEC reaction. However, the adsorbed
CO32– and OH– contents
(curve 3) increase when pH is increased to 12.5, indicating that the
adsorption of carbonate ions results in the formation of the carbonate
salt on the ZnO surface. The highest intensity of OH– is found at pH 8.3 and 8.5 because of the formation of ZnOH+ on the ZnO NR surface (eq 2). In addition, photocorrosive damage of ZnO NRs is
also visible in the abovementioned cases from Figure S7. Therefore, the PEC activity and stability of ZnO
can be improved by the combination of Na2B4O7 and Na2CO3 buffering agents.

and (2) initial photocurrent densities of ZnO

of pH.

Table 1 compares
the results of methods in suppressing the photocorrosion of ZnO during
the PEC reaction. Qiu et al.53 and Lee
et al.54 reported the ∼90% loss
of the initial photocatalytic activity of ZnO-based photoanodes after
a 1 h test when a nonbuffered Na2SO4 electrolyte
was used (pH 6.8). The stability of ZnO was improved by doping metals
into ZnO; however, the decline of photocatalytic activity was observed
because of the dissolution of ZnO which contacted directly between
the partial bare ZnO electrode and the electrolyte. Another improvement
method is the TiO2 coating on ZnO, which showed 100% stability.
In comparison with the metal-doped ZnO, the TiO2-coated
ZnO shows completely preserved photocurrent at pH 13 after the 1 h
PEC reaction.55 However, Yan et al.56 and Su et al.57 reported
86 and 90% retention of the initial PEC activity in the nonbuffered
Na2SO4 electrolyte using BiVO4 and
poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT) as the protective films.
Note that the electrical energy used by Yan et al.56 was higher than that used in Liu et al.55 Note that Fekete et al.29 has
proposed that the stability of ZnO can be improved by the usage of
buffered electrolytes in the pH 9–12.5 region. Also, note the
∼100% retention of the initial photoactivity in the present
study as well as the TiO2-coated ZnO electrode reported
by Liu et al.55 at pH 13. From a comparison
of previous studies in the literature, Fekete et al.29 reported 100% stability after the 1 h PEC reaction at pH
10.5. Nonetheless, our results are comparable to those reported by
these authors. In fact, the borate concentration used by Fekete et
al.29 is 24 times that employed in this
study, although our results are better than those reported by Fekete
et al. This result indicates that the stability of ZnO NRs in the
binary borate–carbonate electrolyte is better than that in
the single borate or carbonate electrolyte which is relatively easily
corroded by dissociation of Zn ions at relatively low pH conditions
(pH 8.5) during the reaction.

4 Conclusions
The
ZnO NR photoanode is highly stable and active in the PEC water
splitting process when borate and carbonate ions have been employed
as the supporting electrolyte because their buffering capability maintains
the desired pH value at the vicinity of the ZnO NR surface. The results
of photocurrent density and TOF-SIMS demonstrate that both anions
adsorbed on the ZnO NR surface can act as a mediator to increase the
photocatalytic activity of ZnO and protect ZnO NRs. The working pH
windows for the solutions containing single borate or carbonate are
equal to 9–13 and 10–12, respectively, where more than
99% initial photocurrent can retain in the 1 h PEC test. In the unsuitable
pH conditions, the decrease in the PEC activity of ZnO NRs is attributable
to the photocorrosion of the crystalline wurtzite phase. ZnO NRs are
stable in the borate and carbonate electrolytes at pH between 9.5
and 12 and show a minor morphology change after the 1 h PEC test.
When pH is higher than 12.5, the photocatalytic activity decay of
ZnO NRs is dependent on the adsorption of buffer and hydroxyl ions
in the vicinity of the ZnO surface, resulting in the formation of
a passive Zn(OH)2 film with a carbonate salt layer, decreasing
the surface active sites. Most importantly, the stable working pH
window of ZnO in PEC water splitting is obviously extended (between
8.5 and 12.5) by the combination of borate and carbonate ions. The
lifetime of ZnO photocatalysts for PEC water splitting can be effectively
prolonged using the binary electrolyte.
