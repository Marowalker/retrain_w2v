A composite that
undergoes ionic cross-linking in the presence
of salt water is presented as a viable strategy for the development
of chemically responsive materials. The permeation of salt water through
the composite activates embedded inorganic fillers, resulting in the
release of functional ions and subsequent cross-linking with the functional
groups of the polymer matrix. The release of a cross-linking agent
from the inorganic filler and composite is evaluated along with the
impact of the cross-linking on composite properties. The new methodology
is then coupled with a dopamine-functionalized polymer in order to
evaluate the potential of this approach for environmentally triggered
self-healing materials.

Introduction
Nonlinear responses
to small-input stimuli are common and important
in the natural world, yet rare in synthetic systems. One area where
significant advances have been made in imparting nonlinear responsivity
is self-healing materials, where a small damage event (e.g., crack
formation) can trigger extensive chemical reactions which can heal
the crack. Such self-healing materials have been the subject of considerable
attention because of their breadth of potential applications.1−9 To date, most stimuli-responsive systems are polymer based, and
generally fall into one of two categories. The most prevalent approach,
and the one closest to commercialization, involves embedding capsules
which contain functional molecules within a matrix.2,10,11 Mechanical damage to the matrix ruptures
the capsule, releasing the molecules, providing functionalities such
as damage indication and matrix self-healing.2,11,12 In the other prevalent approach, the polymer
is chemically derivatized to undergo a mechanically triggered chemical
transformation or re-bond when fractured and returned to contact.13−15

Although capsule-based systems are effective for providing
mechanical
damage-triggered agent release, there are limited options for driving
agent release via chemical triggers, with the exception of microcapsules
that undergo depolymerization and core release in the presence of
a trigger.16,17 In contrast to capsule-based
systems, where core release is driven by damage to the capsule shell,
a porous inorganic material-based agent release strategy offers a
unique opportunity for active material release, assuming there exists
a trigger that upon entering the porous inorganic particle drives
release of functional chemicals. From a practical standpoint, inorganic
materials are generally structurally robust and thermally stable,
offering potential for self-healing materials compatible with aggressive
processing such as high shear, something difficult to realize using
microcapsules. In our search for inorganics which could provide triggered
release of functional molecules, we were inspired by the controlled
release of chemical agents from metal-organic frameworks, zeolites,
zirconium phosphates, and layered double hydroxides for applications
such as drug delivery.18−21 Critical for self-healing is a release system capable of triggering
by an environmentally applied trigger; we chose to focus on developing
systems triggered by salt water, given the abundance of NaCl(aq) in
both oceanic (∼500 mM) and physiological (e.g., blood, ∼150
mM) environments. Although salt water is an appealing chemical trigger,
its intrinsic functionality is limited because it is monovalent and
not generally catalytic for important reactions; thus, it alone has
limited applicability for driving self-healing. One study attempted
to show salt water-triggered self-healing; however, healing was not
triggered by the salt, but rather by the water, which promoted mobility
of ions, which led to cross-linking.22 Here,
we advance the concept of environmentally triggered materials by preparing
a composite that undergoes ionic cross-linking exclusively in the
presence of a common trigger, salt water. The composites consist of
a multivalent ion-responsive polymer and an inorganic filler, which
upon exposure to salt water releases multivalent ions. The released
multivalent ions then coordinate with the functional groups of the
polymer matrix, resulting in the ionic cross-linking of the matrix.
This concept is specifically demonstrated in a composite consisting
of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and Ca2+-loaded zeolite Y particles
(Ca–Y). As salt water enters the composite, it displaces Ca2+ from zeolite Y, which forms ionic cross-links between carboxylate
groups in the PAA, significantly changing the swelling behavior (Figure 1a).

salt water-triggered cross-linking within
Ca–Y zeolite/PAA composites and its effect on swelling. (b)
Optical images of dry and triggered disk-shaped PAA composites loaded
with Ca–Y or Na–Y after 8 min immersion in a 0.5 M NaCl
solution, showing the reduced swelling of the Ca–Y-loaded composite
because of cross-links formed by salt water-triggered released Ca2+.

Results and Discussion
Initially,
Ca–Y was formed by loading divalent Ca2+ ions inside
the zeolite Y framework through conventional ion exchange.23 Ion exchange was confirmed through the X-ray
diffraction pattern and inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
(ICP-MS) analysis (Figure S1). To improve
the specificity of small ion triggers such as Na+, relative
to large ions that may be present in aqueous solutions, the pores
of Ca–Y were functionalized with silane-coupling agents, a
known method for decreasing the effective diameter of zeolite pores
and controlling the uptake and release of species within the framework.24−27 Pore modification was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S2) and its effect on the salt water-triggered
release kinetics of Ca2+ from Ca–Y evaluated (Figure 2). The amount of
Ca2+ released from pore-modified zeolites upon Na+ triggering is slightly reduced relative to free Ca–Y, but
in all cases the majority of the Ca2+ was released within
10 min. Because the goal was to maximize the Na+-triggered
release of Ca2+ in a pore-modified system, while minimizing
the Ca2+ release because of larger species (as already
discussed), n-(3-triethoxysiylpropyl)-4-hydroxybutyramide
was used as the Ca–Y pore modifier for all subsequent experiments.

Figure 2 Ca2+ release of Ca–Y and two pore-modified Ca–Y
zeolites (PM1: modified with n-(3-triethoxysiylpropyl)-4-hydroxybutyramide
and PM2: modified with 3-aminopropyldiethoxymethyl silane functionalized
with glycidol).

The salt water-responsive
composite was formed by mixing an aqueous
solution of PAA (100 mol %) with an aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium
(TBA) hydroxide to deprotonate the majority (70 mol %) of the carboxylic
acid sites (Ca2+ only cross-links deprotonated carboxylate
groups). An aqueous suspension of pore-modified Ca–Y was then
added to the aqueous polymer solution and mixed thoroughly. Finally,
1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether (0.1–5 mol %) was added as
a covalent cross-linker. The resulting solution was cast into a silicone
mold, dried, and cross-linked by a 5 min thermal treatment (90 °C).
The composite compositions can be found in Table SI 1.

As a first step, Ca2+ release from Ca–Y-containing
composites was evaluated. To perform this study, composites with protonated
PAA were prepared. The protonated PAA contains carboxylic acid groups
which do not form ionic cross-links with multivalent ions; thus, ions
released from the zeolite can leave the polymer. By measuring the
concentration of Ca2+ in 0.5 M NaCl(aq) containing pieces
of the composite over time, the Ca2+ release behavior of
Ca–Y particles contained within the composite can be monitored. Figure 3 shows the release
of Ca2+ from both carboxylic acid (PAA) and deprotonated
carboxylate (TBA–PAA)-based composites over time with varying
degrees of cross-linking, normalized to the maximum release from Ca–Y
in 0.5 M NaCl(aq).

Figure 3 Release of Ca2+ into solution triggered by
0.5 M NaCl(aq)
from the (a) carboxylic acid composite and (b) carboxylate composite
relative to the maximum release from Ca–Y under similar conditions.
The covalent cross-link densities of the composites are 0.1, 1, and
5 mol % as indicated by the legend.

The carboxylic acid composite displays a high release of
calcium
into aqueous solution, indicating dissolved Na+ can drive
release of most the Ca2+ contained within Ca–Y in
the polymer matrix. Initially, Ca2+ release from all the
composites is comparable regardless of polymer cross-link density;
however, over time both the 0.1 and 1 mol % cross-linked composites
display lower levels of Ca2+ in solution, indicating partial
reabsorption of some ions into the polymer. Regardless, all composites
display a release of more than 70% of the Ca2+ load within
30 min.

Upon triggering of the carboxylate composites with NaCl
solution,
divalent ions released from the Ca–Y are expected to coordinate
to the ionized carboxylate groups, leading to a significant retention
of Ca2+ in the composite. In this system, after 60 min,
the carboxylate composites show a maximum Ca2+ release
of only ∼40% (comparable to the release observed in the carboxylic
acid form of the composite in ∼7.5 min), indicating that the
bulk of the ions released from the Ca–Y are in fact retained
by carboxylate groups of the polymer.

To further characterize
the Ca2+ release behavior, the
Ca–Y carboxylate composites were evaluated via 29Si and 23Na magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR. The 29Si spectra before and after triggering display the characteristic
resonances of zeolite Y pertaining to the Si atoms bonded to different
numbers of O–Al and O–Si groups (Figure 4a).28 It is well
known that the position of these resonances is dependent on the Si–O–Si
and Al–O–Si bond angles associated with tetrahedral
sites in the framework, which fluctuate based on the degree of hydration
and presence of cations within the framework.29 Comparison of 29Si NMR of the composite before and after
Na+ ion triggering reveals several shifts. Replacement
of Ca2+ with Na+ cations changes the tetrahedral
bond angle primarily at the Si(3Al) and Si(2Al) sites.30 The resonances observed in our system at these
positions are 3.3 and 1.6 ppm, respectively. Previous studies indicate
that shifts of 1–2 ppm represent a change in the tetrahedral
angle by roughly 6°.29 The observed
shift in the resonances before and after the trigger suggests an increased
tetrahedral bond angle because of ion-exchange as the level of hydration
is equivalent in both cases. Additionally, the positions of the two
intense resonances of Ca–Y and Na–Y match our composites
before and after the trigger, respectively.29

Figure 4 (a) 29Si DPMAS NMR and (b) 23Na MAS NMR of
the 0.1 mol % cross-linked Ca–Y-loaded carboxylate composite
before and after triggering with 0.5 M NaCl(aq).

After triggering the Ca–Y carboxylate composite, two
resonances
can be observed in the 23Na spectra (Figure 4b), both a new resonance at ∼7.6 ppm
corresponding to solid NaCl derived from the NaCl used for triggering
and a broad resonance centered at around −7 ppm corresponding
to the sodium within the framework (see Figures S3 and S4 for details).31 The presence
of solid NaCl suggests NaCl is present in excess, and the broadness
of the second resonance corresponds well with the monovalent or a
mixed divalent–monovalent form of the zeolite expected after
a successful exchange reaction. The combination of the NMR results
supports that the propagation of sodium ions throughout the composite
leads to displacement and release of Ca2+ from Ca–Y,
which also agrees with the observed release behavior of the carboxylic
acid and carboxylate composites in the presence of salt water.

We then proceeded to evaluate the effect of the released Ca2+, with the goal of determining if it can serve as a salt
water-triggered cross-link between carboxylate groups on the polymer
backbone, by monitoring the swelling behavior of composites in aqueous
salt solutions. Formation of Ca2+-centered bridges between
two carboxylic acid groups on the polymer backbone will increase the
cross-link density of the polymer, which should change its swelling
behavior relative to a polymer without ionic cross-linking. Composites
with 0.1, 1, and 5 mol % covalent cross-linked PAA and sufficient
Ca–Y to provide 45 mol % Ca2+ relative to the molar
concentration of carboxylate groups (assuming complete release of
Ca2+ from the zeolite) were cut into circles of known diameter
using a punch. Figure 5a shows the degree of swelling of dry composites after immersion
in the 0.5 M NaCl(aq) triggering solution as a function of time. Note,
the degree of swelling depends on the ionic strength of the media,32 and thus it is important to compare the degree
of swelling after triggering with control composites made using Na+-loaded zeolites exposed to an identical trigger [0.5 M NaCl(aq)]
as Na+ does not form ionic cross-links.

Figure 5 Behavior of dry (a) and
fully swollen (b) composites after treatment
with a salt solution (0.5 M NaCl). The cross-link densities of the
samples are as indicated.

In all cases, the composites
loaded with Na–Y swell faster
and to a higher degree than the Ca–Y-loaded composites. The
lower degree of swelling of the Ca–Y composites relative to
the control suggests that the released divalent ions form ionic cross-links
rapidly. The kinetics of the ionic cross-linking observed in the swelling
experiments correlates well with the rate of Ca2+ release
observed from both Ca–Y and Ca–Y-loaded composites exposed
to a 0.5 M NaCl(aq) solution (in the composite case, full release
was achieved in under 30 min). We propose that salt water first causes
an initial swelling of the composite. Shortly afterwards, Na+ begins to enter the zeolite, triggering release of Ca2+. The released Ca2+ then forms ionic cross-links, driving
deswelling of the composite (note the reduction in diameter of the
Ca–Y disks in Figure 5a after the initial rapid swelling). As shown in Figure 5, the Na–Y-
and Ca–Y-loaded composites exhibit distinctly different behavior.
The time required for the initial Ca2+ crosslink-induced
deswelling (order 5 min) is reasonable based upon the initial release
studies from the carboxylic acid composite, where release of Ca2+ is observed in as little as 2.5 min. The 0.1 mol % cross-linked
Ca–Y composite reaches its lowest degree of swelling at 9 min,
whereas the 1 and 5 mol % cross-linked composites take 10 and 21 min,
respectively, to reach their minimum degree of swelling. This is consistent
with the previously discussed release studies where both the rate
of release of Ca2+ from Ca–Y and retention of Ca2+ within the composite are dependent on the degree of covalent
cross-linking. After the minima is reached, the composite slowly swells,
likely due to displacement of Ca2+ cross-linkers from the
composite by the effectively infinite Na+ in the triggering
solution. The displacement rate is directly correlated with the composite
cross-link density. The 0.1 mol % composite begins reswelling after
∼10 min, whereas the 5 mol % cross-linked sample takes at least
30 min to start reswelling. From the release properties from Figure 3, it can be seen
that the 5 mol % cross-linked system displays a continual release
of calcium for at least 30 min, which accounts for the observed stability
of the composite. In this case, as Ca2+ is displaced from
carboxylate sites, it is replaced with fresh Ca2+ from
Ca–Y, keeping the ionic cross-link density approximately constant.

Deionized (DI) water-swollen composites were also triggered with
excess 0.5 M NaCl(aq) (Figure 5b). Here, the composites began in their fully swollen state
and contracted upon the addition of the triggering solution. In the
lightly cross-linked case, the salt water-triggered contraction of
the Ca–Y composite is not significant compared to the Na–Y
material, perhaps because carboxylate groups are too far apart to
effectively cross-link before the Ca2+ diffuses out of
the composite. The more rigid Ca–Y-loaded composites display
a shrinkage of roughly double the Na–Y-loaded composites upon
exposure to salt water, indicating successful formation of cross-links
between polymer chains. The observed swelling behavior for both the
dry and swollen composites clearly indicates that the Ca–Y-loaded
composites undergo ionic cross-linking in the presence of the salt
water-trigger because of release of Ca2+ ions from the
zeolite.

Upon verification of the salt water-triggered
release of the calcium
ions and corresponding cross-linking, a system was designed to investigate
the plausibility of using such an approach for self-healing applications.
To do so, a functional ligand capable of forming cross-links that
lead to healing behavior with a number of different multivalent metal
ions, dopamine, was incorporated onto PAA using DIC coupling.33,34 NMR analysis showed that ∼15% of the acrylic acid groups
were modified with the ligand (Figure S5). The resulting dopamine-functionalized PAA (DOPA–PAA) was
then used to make composites identical to those presented earlier
(Table SI 2). Swelling experiments indicated
that the composites containing dopamine swell to a lesser degree than
composites made from the nonfunctionalized polymers when treated with
salt solution (Figure S6) and that the
presence of Ca2+ ions in the composites decreases swelling
relative to control samples that only contain Na+ (Figure S7). In both cases, this indicates an
increase in cross-link formation within the composites because of
the presence of the dopamine groups and Ca2+ ions. The
potential for self-healing was then evaluated by damaging the dry
composites with a razor blade and treating them with a drop of salt
water solution (Figure 6). Upon addition of the salt water solution, the composite swells
slightly as it hydrates. Simultaneously, the calcium ions are released
and coordinate with the dopamine, leading to the healing of the damaged
area, which persists even after drying.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a stimuli-responsive
composite was prepared that
undergoes salt water-triggered ionic cross-linking. The combination
of functional fillers with functional polymers enables a sequence
of reactions starting with activation of the inorganic filler, which
drives release of Ca2+. The released Ca2+ subsequently
coordinates and cross-links carboxylate groups of the polymer. The
cross-linking is observed as a reduction of swelling in the composite
relative to control samples and healing behavior is possible if the
polymer contains appropriate functional groups. Salt water-triggering
of responsive polymers may find application in mechanical reinforcement
or self-healing, and experiments on using this new paradigm for realizing
stimuli-responsive materials with such functionalities are planned
in the near future.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(acrylic
acid) (Mw ≈ 450 000), TBA hydroxide
(40% in H2O),
calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (99%), 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether,
glycidol, aminopropyldiethoxymethylsilane, dopamine hydrochloride
(98%), n-hydroxysuccinimide (98%), and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium chloride was purchased
from Fisher Scientific. Sodium chloride was purchased from EMD chemicals. N-(3-Triethoxysiylpropyl)-4-hydroxybutyramide and 3-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl
triethoxysilane were purchased from Gelest. Na–Y was purchased
from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were used as purchased, without further
purification.

Synthesis of Ca–Y Zeolite
Ca–Y was prepared
by ion exchange reactions of Na–Y, according to the literature.23 Na–Y (5 g) was added to a 500 mL round-bottom
flask containing 100 mL of 0.5 M Ca(NO3)2. The
resulting mixture was heated at 60 °C for 12 h and the solid
was recovered by centrifugation. The solid paste was re-dispersed
in 100 mL of 0.5 M Ca(NO3)2, reacted for 12
additional hours, filtered, rinsed with DI water, and dried in an
oven overnight at 60 °C.

Pore Modification of Ca–Y
Zeolite
Pore modification
reactions were adapted from previously published procedures.26 Initially, 5 g of Ca–Y was added to 1
L of toluene in a 2 L round-bottom flask. The solution was degassed
and put under a nitrogen atmosphere. The silane coupling agent (20
mL) was then added and the mixture allowed to stir at room temperature
for 24 h. The resulting solution was filtered and rinsed with toluene
and methanol to remove excess silane. The recovered solid was heated
at 50 °C for 1 h to dry. In the case of APDEMS, the dried pore-modified
product was re-dispersed in toluene and treated with an excess of
glycidol to functionalize the amino group of the silane.

Preparation
of Dopamine-Functionalized PAA
Dopamine-functionalized
PAA synthesis was adapted from the procedure of Chung and co-workers.33 PAA (4.5 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of dimethylformamide
along with 1.15 g NHS and 2.06 g of DCC. The mixture was stirred for
3 h in an ice bath and an additional 3 h at room temperature. Dialysis
of the product yielded PAA–NHS, which was subsequently reacted
with dopamine hydrochloride in a phosphate-buffered saline solution
at pH 8.5. The product was purified by dialysis and freeze-dried to
produce a solid.

Preparation of Ca–Y/PAA Composites
In a typical
experiment, 100 mg of polymer was dissolved in 2 mL of DI water. A
stoichiometric amount of TBAOH was then added to deprotonate the desired
amount of acid sites. Ca–Y was dispersed in ∼2 mL of
DI water, sonicated, and added to the PAA mixture. This solution was
mixed until homogeneous and a stoichiometric amount of 1,4 butanediol
diglycidyl ether was then added as a cross-linking agent. The solution
was cast into silicone molds and allowed to dry. After drying, the
composites were heated at 90 °C for 5 min for covalent cross-linking.
The composition of the prepared composites can be seen in Tables S1 and S2.

Characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis was carried
out on a TA Q50 TGA at a heating rate of 10 °C per minute from
room temperature to 800 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. ICP analysis
was carried out by the UIUC SCS Microanalysis laboratory using a PerkinElmer
Elan DRCe ICP-MS.

23Na and 29Si solid-state
NMR experiments were conducted at 7.04 T on a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer
at the SCS NMR Facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign,
operating at a resonance frequency of ν0 (23Na) = 79.4 MHz and ν0 (29Si) = 59.6 MHz
at room temperature. A Varian/Chemagnetics 4 mm double-resonance APEX
HX MAS probe was used for all MAS experiments under a spinning rate
of 10 kHz and TPPM 1H decoupling.

Experimental sodium
chemical shift referencing, pulse calibration,
and setup were done using 1 M NaCl solution, which has a chemical
shift of 0.00 ppm. The 23Na pulse width used was 2.25 μs,
which is the calibrated selective π/2 pulse width for I = 3/2. A recycle delay of 1 s was used and a number of
transients of 1024 scans were acquired for each sample.

Experimental
silicon chemical shift referencing, pulse calibration,
and setup were done using powdered octakis(dimethylsilyloxy)silsesquioxane
(Q8M8), which has a chemical shift of 11.45
ppm, relative to the primary standard, tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm.
The 29Si π/4 pulse width used was 1.0 μs. A
recycle delay of 30 s was used and a number of transients of 2000
scans were acquired for each sample.

All optical microscope
images were acquired with a Zeiss SteREO
Discovery V20 Microscope.
