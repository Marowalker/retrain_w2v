Wastewater from a potash mine in the central region of
Catalonia
is transported by means of a collector that runs more than 100 km,
spilling into the sea on the Catalan central coast. To analyze the
hydraulics of this infrastructure, the values of the basic parameters
that condition the flow, such as the absolute roughness of poly(vinyl
chloride) (PVC) pipes and the viscosity of the transported brine mixtures,
must be characterized. There exists uncertainty about the value of
absolute roughness of a PVC pipe as described in the literature; nevertheless,
if the pipe is smooth, the influence of the absolute roughness in
the hydraulic determination of viscosity will not be significant.
In this work, an experimental procedure based on a hydraulic analysis
was applied to estimate the kinematic viscosity of a brine mixture,
depending on its temperature and concentrations of salts and fines.
The results obtained were compared with the results from experiments
using an Ostwald viscometer.

==== Body
Introduction
The present experimental work is part
of a study whose main objective
was to analyze the hydraulic behavior of a pipeline when transporting
the waste brine generated in the salt mines of the Bages region in
Catalonia (Spain) (Figure 1) before it is spilled into the Mediterranean Sea. In Spain,
at the moment, there are no local regulations about permitted salt
concentrations before spilling into the sea. Despite the high salt
concentration of the transported waste brines, these are lower than
spilled waste from other processes such as a desalination water process.
It can be noticed that Spain is one of the world’s leading
producers of desalinated water, whose waste is fundamentally spilled
into the sea through a marine outfall. Apart from the several different
saline compounds that constitute this salt, it also contains a small
percentage of insoluble fine particles. Prior to resorting to a hydraulic
analysis, it was necessary to determine the viscosity of the fluid.
For this purpose, a simple hydraulic experimental model was designed
and constructed in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the Civil Engineering
School of UPC-BarcelonaTECH. There, the value of the brine viscosity
was obtained indirectly for different concentration values of the
solid part. An Ostwald viscometer was also used to calculate the viscosity
of the same brine samples, after first filtering off the fines, to
know the effect of the insoluble particles on the viscosity of these
samples.

Consequently, the scope of this paper is:To calibrate the absolute roughness of a PVC pipeline
of an experimental facility in the laboratory.

To estimate the viscosity of highly concentrated brine,
depending on the concentration of solute and its temperature.

To analyze the effect of insoluble fine
particles on
brine viscosity.



It is well known how the viscosity of water varies depending
on
the fluid temperature. In the case of brine dissolution, this viscosity
additionally also varies depending on the concentration of solute.
Several authors1−3 have studied how water viscosity varies when a particular
soluble compound, such as sodium chloride or potassium chloride, is
added. As could be expected, the higher the salt concentration, the
higher the viscosity of the solution. Kestin et al.4 presented the viscosity values of sodium chloride solutions
depending on the temperature (for a range between 20 and 150 °C)
and on the concentration of solute (for a range between 0 and 6 mol/kg).
Gonçalves and Kestin5 presented
the viscosity of potassium chloride solutions for temperatures between
25 and 50 °C and solute concentrations of up to 4.55 mol/kg.
Finally, Phang and Stokes6 made the same
analysis for solutions of magnesium chloride, at 25 °C and for
concentrations between 0 and 6 mol/kg.

The present study deals
with a salt solution formed mainly by NaCl
but also containing KCl, MgCl2, and CaSO4 among
other compounds. The viscosity of the mixture constituted of this
salt varies according to its interaction with these compounds. For
example, in the case of NaCl and KCl solutions, Zhang and Han7 presented the viscosity at 25 °C for different
molar ratios in the two solutes and for concentrations between 0 and
6 mol/kg. Similarly, Qiblawey and Abu-Jdayil8 provided the viscosity for solutions formed by NaCl and MgCl2 between 25 and 45 °C for different molar ratios and
solute concentrations between 0 and 4 mol/kg.

In addition to
the interaction between different solutes, it should
be considered that the presence of insoluble solid particles in the
brine mixture also modifies its viscosity. According to Gillies et
al.,9 when a mixture contains insoluble
material in the form of fines it is necessary to measure its viscosity
experimentally. However, several equations for calculating viscosity
can be found in the literature.10−14 Nevertheless, as all the correlations presented in the literature
for the calculation of the viscosity of sediment mixtures are designed
for particles of the same diameter, it is necessary to measure the
viscosity9 experimentally for real cases
involving mixtures with heterogeneous grain sizes.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Setup
The experimental facility (EF) was
built in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the Civil Engineering School
of UPC-BarcelonaTECH.

The schematic layout of the pipeline system
used in this study is shown in Figure 2. This facility consisted of a closed PVC loop of length
71 m, made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. The setup was
composed of a 100 mm inner diameter pipeline connected to a 1.1 kW
centrifugal pump (company HASA, model RGM-S-17/2). A paddle wheel
flow meter (Sensotec, model VTH100) was installed for continuous monitoring
of the flow rate, as shown in Figure 2. The velocity measurement interval was from 0 to 6
m/s, and its uncertainty was ±0.03 m/s. The pressure drop was
measured at five points using piezoresistive transducers (Messtech,
model FR-401): at the inlet (Pe), at the
outlet (P1) of the pump, and at three more points distributed along
the pipeline (P2–P4). Sensors P1–P4 measured relative
pressures from 0 to 1.5 bar, while Pe measured
pressures within a range from −1 bar to 0. The slurry mixture
was prepared in a cylindrical aluminum tank (Hackman Wedholms) that
acts as an accumulator deposit. The capacity of this tank was 0.750
m3, and it had an inner diameter of 1.22 m. The temperature
of the flow was also recorded by RTD sensors (Desin, model PT100)
at five points: one inside the accumulator deposit (T1), three along
the pipeline loop (T2–T4), and the last one in the pipe returning
to the deposit (T5). Their tolerance was ±0.03 °C at 0 °C
and ±0.08 °C at 100 °C. All five RTDs were calibrated,
and the maximum deviation between them was lower than 0.3 °C.

Figure 2 Schematic
layout of the experimental facility (EF).

The EF loop presented some non-negligible local
energy losses,
which complicated its setup and later the hydraulic analysis.

All pressure transducers are connected to the pipe by means of
a threaded element from which there is a spit that allows to extract
fluid from inside the pipe. Likewise, close to the recirculation tank,
there is also a small decanter deposit from which, once the system
is stopped, a sediment sample can be collected.

Properties of the Tested Brines
The EF described above
allows recirculation of a solution of water and salt. Salt from the
mines of the Bages region was used to produce the brine or slurry
mixtures tested in this study. The characteristics of the brines (density,
solid mass percentage, and solid concentration) are shown in Table 1. To ensure maximum
dissolution of the salt in water, the mixture was circulated for at
least an hour through the experimental loop. Subsequently, the density
and solid concentration of the mixture were measured for a sample
extracted from the flow. The chemical composition of the tested brine
is shown in Table 2, and it is obtained through inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and ionic chromatography:15

The salt mines of Bages region in Catalonia have been
exploited
since 1912 for the extraction of potash. The total composition of
the salt extracted is well known;16−18 therefore, for calculating
the moles of each element in 100 g of sample, it is considered that
the cations of sodium, magnesium, and potassium form chlorides and
calcium forms sulfates. This is not an exact calculation but provides
an approximate idea of the percentage in weight of each compound in
the tested brine (Table 3). Apart from the several compounds determined in this way, there
is also a non-negligible insoluble part made up specifically of fines
(clay and silt).

The insoluble part was accurately analyzed from a
sample obtained
from the connections of the pressure transducers to the pipeline (Figure 3).

The granulometric analysis of the same sediment
sample is shown
in Figure 4. The granulometric
curve (solid line) shows a heterogeneous material, as it contains
several dominant particle sizes. This can also be observed in the
dashed curve, which represents the percentage in weight of particles
that are retained by each sieve; the presence of several peaks denotes
that there are some particle sizes that are more common than others.
The particle size with a higher presence in the sediment sample corresponds
to the maximum of this curve, which is between 498 and 704 μm
and represents 25.4% of the total. Regarding the two peaks of the
dashed curve, it can be appreciated that 28.75% of the particles are
accumulated between the sieves of 105 and 249 μm, while 19.16%
are retained between the sieves of 37 and 105 μm. Finally, there
are non-negligible 22.58% of the particles below 37 μm. The
figure summarizes these data and shows an interval with almost no
particles between sieves from 249 to 498 μm.

Figure 4 Graphs (in %) of passing
(solid line) and retained (dashed line)
material versus sieve size. The d50 grain
size is 141.5 μm.

The figure also shows that the diameter corresponding
to 50% of
the accumulated distribution (d50) is
141.5 μm. This d50 is usually used
as a particle size representative of a sample of sediments, but in
the case of a distribution of heterogeneous sizes, as in our case,
this representability decreases.

Finally, the analysis of the
sample shows that the maximum concentration
of solids (that is, the different dissolved salts plus the suspended
particles) that the mixture is capable of transporting is 331 kg/m3. The verification consisted simply of adding enough brine
to the filled tank to saturate it and removing the mixture to favor
the dissolution of the soluble elements. Brine was added until a deep
sediment bed of a few centimeter thickness was formed at the bottom
of the tank. Then, this mixture was circulated for more than an hour
to allow it to reach equilibrium with regard to the dissolution–precipitation
of salts and the drag–sedimentation of insoluble particles.
Afterward, a sample of the flowing mixture was taken and its density
and concentration were measured. The resulting values were 1202 kg/m3 and an equivalent solid percentage of 27.5% (kg of total
solids/kg of mixture), respectively. Finally, to ensure that the measured
concentration was the actual saturation of the mixture, more brine
was added to the mixture and the process repeated, until it was observed
that the same result was obtained.

Experimental Methodology
The main aim of the experimental
procedure was to obtain the viscosity of the different brines tested.
Different experimental campaigns were carried out for the purpose
to determine the viscosity and EF parameters: local head losses and
absolute roughness. The process followed for the determination of
viscosity was as follows:1. Determination of the local head losses
due to the elbows and the butterfly valve located in the experimental
loop. To this end, experiments with clear water were carried out for
six different flow rates. The local energy losses in each of the three
controlled sections in the EF were calibrated independently by means
of tests with clear water using the equation 1  where hloc represents the local head losses, v is
the average velocity, g is the gravity acceleration, K is a dimensionless local head loss coefficient, and Δh is a fitting parameter. The process to calibrate the values
of K and Δh is explained in
next section.

2. Determination
of the absolute roughness
of the pipe from the same experiments with clear water.

3. Estimation of the friction factors
(f) for all flow rates and brine concentrations.
This process was performed independently for each test and for each
of the three reaches of the EF controlled by sensors. From the values
of the hydraulic gradient, the friction coefficient for each test
and reach was obtained using the Darcy–Weisbach equation.

4. Determination of the viscosity
of the
brines. Viscosity of the brine mixtures used in the tests was determined
by fitting a nonlinear regression to the points of observed pressure
values using the Darcy–Weisbach relation and the Swamee and
Jain equation. The observed pressure gradients correspond to the entire
EF loop, from sensors P1–P4 (Figure 1). Since the value of the absolute roughness
of the pipe is already known, the only remaining unknown parameter
in the previous equations is the viscosity of the brine mixture.



As is well known, the viscosity of a fluid depends on
its temperature. That is why all of the tests were carried out in
a controlled environment, with a temperature close to 25 °C.

Results and Discussion
Local Energy Losses in the EF
The calibration of the
parameters K and Δh of the
local head losses, eq 1), was done in three steps.

In the first step, only the contribution
of K to the total head losses, hloc, was considered (Δh was set
to zero). K was estimated using the tables provided
by Lencastre.19 From the observed energy
losses, and using the Darcy–Weisbach equation for the evaluation
of the friction losses, a friction factor (f) was
obtained for each flow rate. Figure 5 shows the results of this first estimation of Darcy–Weisbach
friction factors. As can be clearly observed, they do not follow a
particular relative roughness curve. Since all of the tests were carried
out under the same conditions and in the same loop, the relative roughness
values obtained in each test should be the same, whereas they were
substantially different.

Figure 5 Friction coefficient values obtained for each
of the three controlled
sections of the EF, from the experiments with clear water, as reflected
in Moody’s diagram. Preliminary results with local head losses
obtained from the literature.

In the second step, the friction factor was estimated
through the
Nikuradse20 expression. Considering that
the pipe used in the EF was made of PVC, and also the range of the
Reynolds numbers, the flow conditions are of smooth turbulent flow,
and for that reason, the Nikuradse20 expression
in which the friction factor is a function of the Reynolds number
but not of the relative roughness is appropriate. In this second step, eq 1) was used to evaluate
the local head losses, with the same values of K as in the previous
step. The parameter adjusted to fit the numerical results of total
energy losses with the observed ones was Δh. From this adjustment, it was seen that numerical results could
not fit with the observed ones if a constant value of Δh was used. Figure 6a shows the linear relation between Δh and the kinetic energy per unit of weight in each test and each
reach of the EF in this second step. This linear variation shows that
Δh can be decomposed in a term dependent on
v2/2g and a constant term (which will
be the new Δh for the third step). In the third
step, the linear variation of the local losses was added to the K coefficient, thus resulting in a new value of K, whereas Δh was maintained constant
for each reach (Figure 6b). The final results of constant K and Δh in each controlled reach of the loop are shown in Table 4. Negative values
of Δh can appear, as no physical meaning is
associated with this parameter, although it has a function of compensating
possible errors or deviations in the experimental procedure.

Figure 6 Δh values obtained for the first iteration
(above) and the third one (below), during the calibration of local
head losses for each monitored section of the EF, depending on v2/2g.

2	1.144	0.002	0.100	0.008	
3	0.515	0.001	–0.010	0.008	
Finally, using the estimated constant values of K and Δh of the third step, the friction
coefficients
required to fit the observed and calculated total energy losses were
obtained. These new Darcy–Weisbach friction factors fit better
with the smooth turbulent flow zone in Moody’s diagram (Figure 7). The values of f for lower Reynolds numbers were the ones that presented
greater deviations. This is in agreement with the sensitivity analysis
of the friction factor calculation.

Figure 7 Friction coefficient values obtained for
each of the three reaches
of the EF, from the experiments with clear water. Results were obtained
after the calibration of localized head losses.

Absolute Roughness of the Pipe
The absolute roughness
was obtained using the relationship of Swamee and Jain21 and the results from the clear water tests,
resulting in a value for each Reynolds number. Using this analysis,
a mean absolute roughness value of 0.033 mm was obtained, with a ±40%
error for a 95% confidence interval and a 0.998 correlation (R2). This value is higher than usual in smooth
plastic tubes (0.0015 mm, according to Lencastre19), but the values of absolute roughness may present great
variations due to any inner obstacle of the tube (e.g., an imperfect
joint) or the aging of the material due to its contact with the brine
used during the experimental campaign.

Analysis of Darcy–Weisbach Friction Factor in EF
Table 5 shows the
hydraulic gradients, that is to say the linear losses per unit length,
for each test and loop section, and the friction coefficients associated
with each. It also shows the average hydraulic gradients for calculation
of the corresponding friction coefficient. The same table shows the
Reynolds number associated with each test. To calculate the number,
it is necessary to know the viscosity of the tested mixtures since
the brine flow is in the transition zone. The procedure for determining
this physical parameter is detailed later.

The Reynolds numbers during the tests using clear
water, which
were the ones used to estimate the local head losses in the EF, ranged
from 5.8 × 104 to 1.6 × 105.

The resulting friction coefficient is plotted in Figure 7 over the Moody diagram. The
results are similar to those obtained for water, as they are also
close to the curve associated with smooth pipes. As explained later,
the sensitivity of the calculated friction coefficient is high; therefore,
its precision is small and prevents determination of the exact results
in Moody’s diagram. Nevertheless, the tendency of the results
to those obtained for clear water can be emphasized, albeit showing
a greater dispersion in this case. The three points that differ more
from the smooth turbulence line (two in relation to brine E mixture
and one to brine A) correspond to the tests with the lowest flow rate.
This makes sense because the sensitivity analysis explained later
shows that the error associated with the calculation of the friction
coefficient increases when the flow rate decreases.

Viscosity of the Tested Brine Mixtures
Figure 8 shows the curves fitted to
each one of the studied brine mixtures, and Tables 6 and 7 summarize the
kinematic viscosity values obtained.

In all five regressions, the experimental values for
the two lower
flow velocities are not over the fitted curve, which agrees with the
conclusions of the sensitivity analysis of the friction factor estimation,
as discussed later; the lower the flow rate, the higher the error
related to the calculations. Even so, the values of R2 in all cases are greater than 0.98 so that the fit of
the regression curves with the data is high.

Figure 9 and Tables 6 and 7 present the
different values of kinematic viscosity of the
brine mixtures at 25 °C, for the different salt concentrations
that were determined. It can be observed that although NaCl constitutes
92% of the salt, the viscosity does not correspond to that of a pure
solution of this salt. The theoretical kinematic viscosities of water
and the pure dilutions of MgCl2,6 KCl,5 and NaCl,4 for different densities but at the same temperature, are also represented
in the same Figure 9.

Figure 9 Experimental values of kinematic viscosity at 25 °C of the
tested brine mixtures, depending on their density, and comparison
of the theoretical kinematic viscosity of pure water (blue straight
line) to those of pure solutions of MgCl2 (brown line),
NaCl (green line), and KCl (red line), all at 25 °C.

As already presented in Table 3, the salt used in the laboratory consists
of these
three salts, in addition to CaSO4 and a small insoluble
part. The kinematic viscosities resulting from the calculations carried
out follow a clear trend, that although NaCl constitutes 92% of the
salt, the curve traced by the pure solution of this salt does not
correspond to this situation. The lack of data for densities ranging
from 1000 to 1100 kg/m3 does not allow knowing the behavior
of the kinematic viscosity of the brine studied in this interval,
although it is below the value of the kinematic viscosity of water,
following the curve pattern of the KCl solution until it reaches a
density of approximately 1124 kg/m3 (brine D). From this
point, the viscosity increases rapidly as more salt is added to the
mixture at a much higher rate than in the case of sodium chloride
solution.

On the other hand, the filtered mixtures follow a
trend closer
to that corresponding to this solution. The viscosity of the filtered
brines F, G, and H (eliminating solid insoluble particles) was measured
by an Ostwald viscometer. A regression curve was fitted to the kinematic
viscosity values of the nonfiltered mixtures at 25 °C, depending
on their density, and had been subsequently adapted to the rest of
the temperatures (Figure 10) to obtain a relationship among kinematic viscosity, density,
and temperature.

°C of the tested slurry mixtures and comparison with theoretical

Discussion
For discussion of the results, we begin
by referring to a microscopic
analysis of the tested brines. This analysis points out the composition
of the tested fluid, as already presented previously. Second, a sensitivity
analysis of the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor is performed
to characterize the accuracy of the results shown above. Next, the
influence of previously obtained absolute roughness on the values
of viscosity is analyzed. This analysis leads, finally, to featuring
the resistance to flow of the tested brines by means of the introduction
of the dimensionless pressure coefficient from the tests carried out.

Microscopic Analysis of the Tested Brine
Figure 11 shows three images
obtained through laser microscopy of the solid sample deposited at
stagnation points observed in Figure 3. Two kind of particles can be observed in the insoluble
portion of the brine flow: the bigger sized particles with clear geometric
shapes, while the rest are aggregated to the first and are amorphous.
The crystalline shaped particles correspond to salt precipitates,
which would have been formed during the drying process of the sediment
sample. On the other hand, the amorphous aggregates correspond to
the insoluble fine particles. A similar image is shown in Freyer and
Voigt,22 corresponding to calcium sulfate
crystals, while in de Oliveira et al.23 and Guo et al.,24 cubic shapes of sodium
chloride and potassium chloride crystals are presented, respectively.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the analyzed sample is composed
of crystals of CaSO4 and insoluble particles aggregated
to them.

Figure 11 Images of laser microscopy of the tested sediment sample, ordered
from minor (left) to major (right) magnification.

The images also revealed the presence of salt crystals
among the
collected sediments for the mixtures above the limit of saturation
of CaSO4 (according to Bock25). This means that precipitation of CaSO4 occurred, but
no aggregates were formed on the walls of the pipe.

Sensitivity Analysis of the Darcy–Weisbach Friction Factor
Analysis of the accuracy of the Darcy–Weisbach friction
factor shows that it depends on the hydraulic grade, the internal
diameter and the length of the pipe, and the average flow velocity.
Regarding the flow velocity, its accuracy was estimated by means of
the standard deviation obtained from each test. Its estimated error
ranges from 2.8% for high velocities (around 1.6 m/s) to 4.3% for
the lowest (0.6 m/s). On the other hand, for the internal diameter
and the length of the pipe, the error is constant and only depends
on the accuracy of measurement, being ±0.1 and ±5 mm, respectively.
Finally, the accuracy of the hydraulic grade is estimated applying
a Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations) assuming a uniform probability
for the errors of the variables involved in the energy balance. The
error associated with the potential energy per unit of length (height
of controlled cross sections) was assumed to be ±1 mm. On the
other hand, the error of the pressure energy per unit of weight is
estimated by the standard deviation of the different tests in the
laboratory. The variation coefficient of each recorded time series
varies depending on the sensor and the Reynolds number, and it ranges
from 1.3% (sensor P4 and maximum flow rate) to 5.6% (sensor P1 and
minimum flow rate).

The propagation of all of these errors on
the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor, carried out by another
simulation of Monte Carlo, is shown in Figure 12. As in the previous case, accuracy in the
tests with lower flow velocities worsens exponentially. However, for
flow velocities greater than 1 m/s, the accuracy of the Darcy–Weisbach
friction factor is less than 35%.

Figure 12 Accuracy of friction head losses obtained
for each mixture in each
section of the EF.

Influence of Absolute Roughness on Viscosity
Calculation
of the viscosity of brine mixtures was preceded by the calibration
of the experimental loop to obtain the value of the absolute roughness
of the pipe. For this purpose, as explained above, the absolute roughness k was obtained with an associated error of ±40% (for
a 95% confidence interval). To know the influence of this possible
error on the calculation of the viscosity of the mixtures, the process
of obtaining the viscosity was repeated, imposing a variation in k within that interval of error. Table 8 shows the kinematic viscosity deviation
obtained for the brine mixtures after ±40% deviation in absolute
roughness value. It can be appreciated that the influence of the absolute
roughness on viscosity is small, considering that a deviation of ±40%
has been considered. A change in absolute roughness causes a lower
variation in the values of viscosity obtained than the errors associated
with the regressions carried out for calculation of viscosity (Table 6).

Table 8 Kinematic Viscosity Deviation Obtained
for the Brine Mixtures after ±40% Deviation in Absolute Roughness
(k)
brine mixture	density (kg/m3)	viscosity
deviation for a 40% reduction of k (%)	viscosity
deviation for a 40% increase of k (%)	
A	1157.5	2.65	–2.56	
B	1141.6	2.85	–2.93	
C	1134.1	3.06	–3.06	
D	1124.1	3.23	–3.21	
E	1109.3	3.33	–3.33	
On the other hand, as already evident from the sensitivity
analysis
for the friction factor, the deviation in the results, caused by any
error of calculation of the absolute roughness, is in this case higher
for lower densities.

Resistance to Flow
The energy grade was obtained for
each brine mixture and different Reynolds number by means of the recorded
pressure values during the different tests. To illustrate the influence
of increasing the total solid concentration on the flow resistance
for different mixtures, the results are presented together in Figure 13. Logically, mixtures
with a higher concentration of solids, and therefore higher density,
have higher linear head losses and the difference with other mixtures
is accentuated for higher Reynolds numbers, as viscosity becomes more
important.

Figure 13 Energy grade from experimental data for each brine mixture.

On the other hand, Figure 14 shows the average of all of the recorded
experimental data
and the curves that were fitted to determine the viscosity (in the
case of brine mixtures) or absolute roughness (in the case of clear
water). The curves represent the pressure coefficient (Cp) on the vertical axis and the Reynolds number on the
horizontal axis 2  where  is the manometric increment per unit of
weight in a controlled reach and  is the kinetic energy per unit of weight
in that reach.

Figure 14 Estimated pressure coefficients from experimental data
for each
brine mixture.

The presented data no longer depends on the density
of the mixture
or its viscosity, and for that reason, all of the data are fitted
to one single curve. Anyway, it can be appreciated that, for low Reynolds
numbers, brines A, C, and E show a lower fitting to the curve.

Conclusions
An experimental method to estimate the
viscosity of a brine is
presented. For that purpose, an experimental facility consisting of
a 70 m-long PVC pipeline loop (Figure 2) was designed. Brine mixtures with solid concentrations
ranging from 187 to 331 kg/m3 were tested. The density
and solid concentration of the tested brines are described in Table 1. The values of kinematic
viscosity of the brine mixtures, generated at 16, 20, 25, and 30 °C
for different salt concentrations, were obtained. At the same time,
the viscosities of different filtered mixtures (eliminating insoluble
solid particles) were measured using an Ostwald viscometer. All of
the results are plotted in Figures 9 and 10 and summarized in Tables 6 and 7.

It can be observed that although NaCl constitutes
92% of the brine,
the viscosity curve of the brine does not correspond to that of a
pure solution of this salt. The lack of data in the range of densities
from 1000 to 1100 kg/m3 prevented knowing the behavior
of the kinematic viscosity curve for this interval. For densities
greater than 1124 kg/m3, viscosity increases rapidly as
more salt is added to the mixture and at a much higher rate than in
the case of sodium chloride pure solution (Figure 9).

On the other hand, the results from
filtered mixtures show that
these follow a very similar trend to those corresponding to the nonfiltered
solutions (Figure 10). A relationship among kinematic viscosity, density, and temperature
was obtained by means of a regression curve fitted to the kinematic
viscosity of the nonfiltered mixtures at 25 °C, depending on
their density, and subsequently adapting it for the rest of the temperatures.

During the tests carried out in the experimental facility manufactured
with PVC pipes, no precipitation of salts was observed inside the
pipe, even when circulating a brine mixture close to the saturation
limit. In spite of this, the images obtained by means of microscopy
showed the presence of salt crystals among the collected sediments
and it was observed that three of the mixtures generated were above
the limit of saturation of CaSO4 (according to Bock25). It seems clear, therefore, that precipitation
of CaSO4 occurred but did not affect the hydraulic operation
of the circuit since no aggregates were formed on the walls of the
pipe.
