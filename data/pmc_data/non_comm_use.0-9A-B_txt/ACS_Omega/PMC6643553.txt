Determination of aromaticity in hydrocarbons
may be as simple as
determining the average bond length for the molecule of interest.
This would greatly assist in classifying the nature of hydrocarbon
chemistry, especially for large molecules such as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) where today’s aromatic classification methods
are prohibitively expensive. The average C–C bond lengths for
a test set of known aromatic, antiaromatic, and aliphatic cyclic hydrocarbons
are computed here, and they show strong delineating patterns for the
structural discernment of these aromaticity classifications. Aromatic
molecules have average C–C bond lengths of 1.41 Å or less
with the largest molecules, PAHs, having the longest average C–C
bond lengths; aliphatic species have such lengths of 1.50 Å or
more; and antiaromatic species fall between the two. Consequently,
a first-order guess as to the aromaticity of a system may simply arise
from its geometry. Although this prediction will likely have exceptions,
such simple screening can easily classify most cases, and more advanced
techniques can be brought to bear on the cases that lie in the boundaries.
Benchmarks for hydrocarbons are provided here, but other classes of
molecular structural aromaticity likely will have to be defined on
an ad hoc basis.

Introduction
The simple average C–C bond length
in a cyclic, planar molecule
is promoted in this work as a correlating predictor of aromaticity
or antiaromaticity, but no attempt is made to define either term.
The definition of aromaticity has ranged across various forms since
the inception of this chemical term in the mid-19th century. Modern
definitions of aromaticity include delocalization of electrons leading
to stabilization in the bonding energy. Such is a long way from simply
invoking the chemist’s nose to discern some odor. One of the
most successful, and certainly longest lasting, definitions of aromaticity
is Hückel’s 4n + 2 rule for the number
of electrons in planar, cyclic molecules. Although this equation applies
well to π electrons in sp2 hybridized systems, σ
and δ aromaticities are also typically easily defined utilizing
this same approach. H3+ is a classic example
of σ aromaticity with n = 0.1−3

Although
the 4n + 2 rule works well in monocyclic
systems, it starts to break down as the ring size grows.4 Consequently, more concrete definitions of aromaticity,
especially π aromaticity, have been a major thrust of research
over recent decades.5 Some include various
methods put forth by late Paul v. R. Schleyer such as block-localized
wave function-extra cyclic resonance energy (BLW-ECRE), energy decomposition
analysis-aromatic stabilization energy, and nucleus-independent chemical
shift.6,7 Others include the multicenter index (MCI),
the para-delocalization index, and the aromatic fluctuation index
(FLU),8,9 among many others.5 Each of these methods involves computing energies for different
portions of the molecule and constructing schema to physically interpret
the results as aromaticity and its subsequent molecular energy stabilization.
These methods are powerful and provide excellent insights into the
geometry of cyclic systems even beyond hydrocarbons.10

However, simpler metrics such as the average C–C
bond length
may be available to predict aromaticity even without defining or expressly
quantifying it. Although this molecular observable is used as one
of the conditional constraints in some quantifications of aromaticity,16 such as the harmonic oscillator stabilization
energy (HOSE) method,5,17 this simpler approach in averaging
the C–C bond lengths may be useful for roughly approximating
aromaticity in cyclic hydrocarbons with notable application to polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are believed to make up as much
as 20% of the carbon in the universe and can grow to immense sizes
including hundreds of atoms.18,19 Small changes in the
PAH geometry are also common with an internal carbon easily removed
from the system due to collisions with energetic particles and cosmic
rays. As a result, the aromaticity of such systems can change, leading
to new chemistry as the PAH attempts a return to aromatic planarity
or even antiaromatic (in the 4n + 2 definition) spheres
creating species such as buckyballs.20−23 FLU, MCI, ECRE, and HOSE computations
of PAHs and buckyballs are intractable from a practical sense. Certain
PAHs of interest could be computed, but the number of PAHs and closely
related hydrocarbon derivatives could become immense, especially for
dynamics and chemical reaction studies. There can be hundreds of resulting
species where accurate but costly methods are not capable of treating
each system of interest. Structure may help in the aromaticity predictions
and can be computed fairly reliably with even simple methods. Although
aromaticity has been utilized to predict average bond lengths in PAHs,24 this work is proposing the converse: bond lengths
to predict aromaticity.

Most π aromatic hydrocarbon geometries
have bond lengths
that fall in between that of a C–C single bond (1.54 Å
from ethane) and a C=C double bond (1.34 Å from ethylene)
as a result of the “partial” bonding in the electron
delocalization. For instance, benzene is known to have bond lengths
of around 1.40 Å, closer to that of the double bond but different
enough to be classified uniquely. True Kekulé geometries would
alternate the single and double bonds, giving an average bond length
between the two, as benzene exhibits. Hence, the average bond length
may be useful as a simple, first-order prediction of aromaticity.

In reality, all of the bonds will be of the same length is true, D6h benzene, but not all aromatics
are so highly symmetric. The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is cyclopropenylidene,
c-C3H2. It follows the Hückel 4n + 2 rule with n = 0 for the number of
π electrons but possesses a lone pair on the apical carbon.
As such, there are two 1.4262 Å C–C bond lengths and one
1.3295 Å bond length from quantum chemical computations.25 The shorter bond length is between the two CH
groups because they share both a σ and a π bond, creating
a double bond from the Lewis definition of molecular structure. Hence,
the average bond length of c-C3H2 is 1.3940
Å, quite close to that of benzene, indicating aromaticity.

Results
and Discussion
To further expand this idea of average bond
length as a predictor
of aromaticity, quantum chemical computations are utilized to compute
the geometries of a set of known aromatic, antiaromatic, and aliphatic
species. Coupled cluster theory26,27 at the single, double,
and perturbative triple level [CCSD(T)]28 with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set,29,30 as well as
explicitly correlated MP2-F1231,32 with the aug-cc-pVDZ
basis set, is utilized to treat larger systems like PAHs for this
assessment. The methods are chosen because CCSD(T) is considered to
be the “gold standard” of quantum chemistry33 but sometimes it is too costly. Reducing down
to MP2 can provide robust geometric information for the larger systems,
and the explicit correlation will further improve the accuracy.

Table 1 presents
the average bond lengths for the systems analyzed as well as the average
C–C bond energies and the isodesmic energies. The average bond
energies are computed by breaking down each of the molecules into
its 3P C, 2∑+ CH, and 1A1 CH2 fragments. For instance, the
average bond energy for c-C3H2 is defined as 1  where nb represents
the number of C–C bonds present in the molecule. For c-C3H2, nb = 3. CCSD(T)/apVTZ
(utilizing an abbreviation for aug-cc-pVTZ) produces a value of 110.0
kcal/mol with MP2-F12/apVDZ similar at 126.3 kcal/mol.

The isodesmic energy is often utilized to compute
ring strain in
a cyclic system and is defined as a reaction energy scheme where the
number and type of bonds are conserved.34 The lowest energy spin states for each system are utilized, making
most of the computed fragments closed-shell singlets. The isodesmic
scheme for c-C3H2 is defined as 2  The isodesmic
energies are −0.8 and
−6.3 kcal/mol for CCSD(T)/apVTZ and MP2-F12/apVDZ, respectively,
for c-C3H2. The isodesmic energies are reported
here to avoid interpretations of destabilization in the average bond
energy resulting from ring strain.

At first glance of Table 1, one interpretation
would be that c-C3H2 is not highly strained.
However, similar cyclic geometries are known
to be highly strained. Cyclopropane is a notable example. The present
computations put the strain energy of that system right at 24.6 and
23.6 kcal/mol again for CCSD(T) and MP2-F12, respectively. These are
quite close to the generally accepted 27 kcal/mol ring strain of c-C3H6. Removing two of the hydrogens to create a lone
pair on the new terminal carbon in cyclopropylidene (c-C3H4), a less stable isomer of allene,35 actually raises the strain energy by roughly 2 kcal/mol.
Consequently, the difference in the isodesmic energies between the
c-C3H2π molecule and either of the non-π-bonded
systems could be a measure of aromaticity.

Additionally, the
average bond energies are notably different between
c-C3H2 and the other cyclic propyl alkanes.
The dissociation of cyclopropenylidene by way of eq 1, again requires 110.0 kcal/mol from CCSD(T).
Similar reactions for cyclopropane and cyclopropylidene require less
at 101.3 and 86.8 kcal/mol, respectively. The MP2-F12 values are higher
but present the same qualitative relative energies. In any case, the
energies have a clear bright line between a traditionally interpreted
aromatic system and traditionally interpreted aliphatic systems. This
correlates with the average bond lengths: 1.385 Å for c-C3H2 compared to 1.511 and 1.502 Å for c-C3H6 and c-C3H4, respectively.
Hence, the average bond length corresponds to aromaticity in this
first example.

Taking the values of Table 1 on the whole, traditional aromatic geometries
have MP2-F12/apVDZ
bond lengths of roughly 1.41 Å and lower. This is similar for
CCSD(T)/apVTZ for those systems suited for study with this more costly
level of theory. Because aromaticity is a cyclic property, an average
bond length approaching that of a double bond is irrelevant (or esoteric
at worst) for the present analysis as continuous double bonds in cyclic
molecules are most often highly strained and unstable. Aliphatic geometries
have bond lengths of 1.50 Å and greater. This is not surprising
because C–C single bonds are typically in this same range.
Comparison of experimental bond lengths to the computed values is
within 0.01 Å for both levels of the theory employed here. c-C5H5– extends slightly beyond the
trend for aromatic species; however, the additional electron delocalizes
the system slightly, thereby extending the bond lengths.

All
of the C3Hx geometries
for c-C3H3+ have notable amounts
of strain in them as evidenced by both the average bond energies and
the isodesmic energies in Table 1. c-C3H is known to be unstable, and work
on c-C3H has shown that even the addition of the single
hydrogen is not enough to stabilize the ring such that a large-amplitude
motion is present in the ring-deformation vibrational modes.36−38 The outlier in c-C3H3+ is resonantly
stabilized, lowering the isodesmic energy below the other cyclopropenyl
family members.

An interesting result is that the traditionally
interpreted antiaromatic
geometries, those cyclic systems with even numbers of π electrons
that do not follow Hückel’s 4n + 2
rule, have average bond lengths and average bond energies that fall
in between those from the aromatic and aliphatic groups. Although
any amount of bond order greater than 1.0 will decrease the average
bond length, the fact that antiaromatic species are more stable than
pure aliphatics is not initially obvious, especially to students.
Two quintessential antiaromatic species include C2h cyclobutadiene (c-C4H4) and the D5h cyclopentadienyl cation (c-C5H5+). As shown in the middle of Table 1, they exhibit average bond lengths between 1.50 and
1.41 Å with average bond energies that also fall in this middle
range for both CCSD(T) and MP2-F12. The cyclopentadienyl cation has
an average bond energy nearly in the range of that expected for aromatic
geometries but the empty p orbital on one of the carbon atoms in the
ring leads to this stabilization. Additionally, the bicyclic c-C8H6 pentalene geometry is also antiaromatic for n = 8 with an average bond length of 1.419 Å and an
average bond energy of 135.9 kcal/mol, both falling in this middle
region. In each case, the C–C bonds share additional electrons,
creating bonds that are shorter than C–C single bonds but longer
than average C–C bonds exhibited in aromatic geometries. As
a result, antiaromatic bonding falls between that of aromatic and
aliphatic.

Larger PAH geometries exhibit convergent behavior
for both bond
lengths and average bond energies. Excluding coronene, which required
use of cc-pVDZ instead of aug-cc-pVDZ, the average MP2-F12/apVDZ bond
length is converging to close to 1.410 Å and the average MP2-F12/apVDZ
bond energy to 140.0 kcal/mol. Such convergent behavior has been shown
for various PAH properties as functions of increasing numbers of benzene
rings.39,40 Quick AM1 computations41 put the average C–C bond lengths in our four PAHs
converging to slightly longer values at 1.413 Å as compared to
the MP2-F12/apVDZ bond length. Consequently, generic and large PAHs
will have bond lengths that are slightly longer than that of benzene
(1.397 Å) and will be close to 1.410 Å. Including coronene
in the analysis lends qualitative evidence that the trend holds. As
a side note, specifically pyrene but also many other PAHs actually
fail the 4n + 2 test. However, each of the rings
taken individually in each PAH passes the test. Again, this has been
known for over half of a century.4 Additionally,
pyrene is experimentally aromatic in behavior, and the trend for aromaticity
based on its bond lengths and energies is also present in our computations.

To examine if the nonaromatic or antiaromatic behavior in molecules
of force planarity that optimize as nonplanar can also be predicted
by this method, cyclooctatetraene (C8H8) is
investigated. This molecule is experimentally known to be of D2d symmetry and has two classes
of four bond lengths, 1.470 and 1.337 Å,15,42 giving an average of 1.404 Å and is exactly what the MP2-F12/apVDZ
results predict. Cyclooctatetraene is nonplanar, meaning that it will
be aliphatic even though it is cyclic. The stabilization brought about
by the out-of-plane bends renders any prediction of aromaticity from
the average bond length moot. However, forcing planarity in a D4h geometry is antiaromatic
by Hückel’s rule, but our computations put the average
bond length of planar C8H8 at 1.407 Å with
an average bond energy of 143.6 kcal/mol. This is at the outer edge
of the antiaromatic range and is encroaching upon the PAH average
bond length range. However, the strain energy for this molecule is
negative, indicating that although it prefers to bend out of plane,
the reduced interior angle of an octagon is enough to provide stability
in the system. Furthermore, C8H8 is large enough
to delocalize without moving into true antiaromaticity, as indicated
by the 1.407 Å bond length existing on the border between aromaticity
and antiaromaticity. This is further evidenced by C10H10 in Table 1, which, if planar, meets the 4n + 2 requirement.
Its average bond length of 1.398 Å fits well into the aromatic
criterion but it also bends out of plane in its lowest energy form,
rendering comments of aromaticity for the C2 minimum geometry moot, as well.

For prediction purposes, the
cyclic c-(C)C3H2, cyclopropenylidene with an
additional carbon atom bonded to the
apical carbon and shown in Figure 1, can be classified in two ways. Relying only on the
bonds in the ring (neglecting the apical C=C bond), the average
bond length for nb = 3 falls into the
antiaromatic range, as shown in Table 1. The 4n + 2 rule fails here because
there are four electrons in the ring, assuming that the central carbon
possesses both π electrons at a given instant. Even so, the
1.424 CCSD(T) average bond length is approaching the aromatic region
of the continuum. Consequently, removing the carbon atom from c-(C)C3H2 to create c-C3H2 clearly
affects the aromaticity in notable ways. Such results corroborate
the conclusions from ref (6) that substituents can greatly influence aromaticity in
cyclopropenyl geometries even when merely replacing a carbon atom
with a carbide group.

Figure 1 Geometry of c-(C)C3H2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, planar,
aromatic molecules defined in the traditional
sense have average C–C bond lengths of 1.41 Å or less.
PAHs, apparently large PAHs, represent the upper bound to this average
bond length. Planar, cyclic antiaromatic species have average bond
lengths of between 1.41 and 1.50 Å. Cyclic geometries with bond
lengths of greater than 1.50 Å are in line with C–C single
bond definitions of ∼1.54 Å. Consequently, the average
C–C bond length can be a good first-order predictor as to whether
a cyclic hydrocarbon is aromatic or antiaromatic. We are not advocating
a robust prediction for the aromatic classification, but this simple
metric appears to correlate well as an initial guess. Although most
quantum chemical determinations of aromaticity are far too costly
for molecules of astrophysical importance like PAHs, effectively determining
the nature of the chemical species can be easily achieved through
the structural aromatic metric described herein.

It has yet
to be seen how side groups and other substituents affect
the average bond length for aromaticity (see c-(C)C3H2, for example). However, such analysis will be left for future
work. A similar approach can likely be utilized for other classes
of molecules beyond hydrocarbons such as nitrogenated PAH molecules
(PANHs) and three-dimensional geometries such as fullerenes. However,
benchmarks for average bond lengths in such systems deemed aromatic
or antiaromatic must be established first.

Computational Details
The CCSD(T)/apVTZ computations utilize the PSI4 program;43,44 the MP2-F12/apVDZ computations are from MOLPRO 2015.1,45,46 and the AM1 computations are from Gaussian09.47 The two former computational approaches utilize the frozen
core electron approximation. Zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs)
are not included in the energy computations due to the complexity
in computing these for the PAHs with current, standard approaches.
However, the absolute bonding and isodesmic energies themselves are
not as important to this study as the relative values are, and ZPVE
inclusions are known to affect relative energies slightly for PAHs
due to their regularity.40
