There
is a growing interest in developing stretchable strain sensors
to quantify the large mechanical deformation and strain associated
with the activities for a wide range of species. Herein, we constructed
elastomeric, healable hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complex (HIPC)
rubberlike film by complexation of hydrogen-bond (H-bond)-donating
poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and H-bond-accepting poly(ethylene oxide)
(PEO) (or poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene
oxide) (F108)). All HIPC elastomers prepared from varied PAA/PEO (or
PAA/F108) ratios are healable elastomers with high extensibility
(with the highest strain of 1400%). Recovery of all films can automatically
occur or be accelerated by externally added water droplet. The stress-
and strain healing efficiencies (ησ and ηε) of the water-assisting healed PAA/F108 blends are
as high as 99%. Furthermore, stretchable and healable conductor films
were fabricated from silver nanowire-printed (Ag-p) and the single-walled
carbon nanotube-blended (SW-b) conductor films, respectively. The
healable Ag-p conductor film is an ultrasensitive strain sensor, exhibiting
large electric resistance variation when stretched. In contrast, the
healable SW-b film is an ultrastable strain sensor with reversible
resistance strain response over 200 stretching release cycles within
a high strain range of 500%. Therefore, this study provides a new
and flexible HIPC strategy for the fabrication of stretchable, ultrasensitive,
and stable self-healing electrode materials.

Introduction
Stretchable,
wearable, flexible, and human-friendly soft electronic
devices have boosted the development of various smart devices,1,2 such as sensors,3 light-emitting diodes
(LEDs),4 lithium-ion batteries,5 and supercapacitors.6 Stretchable electrodes with high toughness play a crucial role in
integrating various devices together to support functions under large
mechanical deformations.7 During the past
few years, several representative strain sensors using carbon nanotube
(CNT),8,9 metal/semiconductor,10,11 graphene,12,13 and conductive polymer14 as conductive components combining with elastomeric
substrates have been successfully fabricated. Among them, silver nanowires
(AgNWs) were frequently used as conductor for flexible electronics,
particularly for high-performance strain sensors15 with great electrical and mechanical properties. In general,
AgNWs were deposited on large-area flexible and stretchable substrates
using solution-coating techniques such as printing, spin coating,
dip coating, etc. However, the AgNW-deposited electrodes16 generally lack self-healing ability due to the
poor adhesion between AgNWs and substrates. Moreover, CNT were often
applied in the strain sensor as conductor, in which the main sensing
mechanism is the change in resistance at the CNT/CNT junctions when
the network is stretched. In general, CNTs were deposited on flexible
substrate as a separate layer, resulting in electrodes that can only
be subjected to small perturbation (a strain below 5%).17−19 Failure of the electrodes is also attributed to the poor interfacial
adhesion between CNT and substrate. Overall, the AgNW- and CNT-deposited
electrodes have several limitations with regard to the substrates,
such as poor interfacial adhesion, limitation of elongation, and lack
of self-healing ability. Therefore, it is of interest to address these
limitations in stretchable conductors. Especially for stretchable
and self-healable composite electrodes usually prepared by mixing
a stretchable self-healing polymer matrix and a conductive material,20−22 fabricating skin-inspired elastomer conductors that are stretchable
and self-healable with good interfacial adhesion and with matched
modulus between electrode and human tissue is highly challenging.23

Self-healing materials have attracted
increasing attention recently.
In general, the automatic self-healing process may involve an irreversible
or a reversible mechanism. The irreversible system has the common
inherent drawback that it can heal only once. Therefore, more recent
research works have been concentrated on reversible system that can
repeatedly break and heal upon external stimuli.24 Reversible system can be based on either covalent interaction,
such as Diels–Alder and retro-Diels–Alder,25,26 or noncovalent interactions, such as H-bonding,27−29 ionic bonding,30 metal coordination,31 or π–π stacking.32 Because of its flexible and dynamic nature, H-bond is one of the
most well-known physical interaction forces applied for the preparation
of reversible self-healing materials. Several previous examples illustrated
the use of H-bond interactions in constructing self-healing materials.
Poly(vinyl alcohol)33 (PVA) hydrogel, from
the freezing/thawing method, can self-heal at room temperature without
any stimulus (e.g., heating). However, the soft PVA hydrogel can only
be stretched to 400% before fracture. A facile one-step approach was
used to construct self-healing antifogging films based on partly cross-linked
PVA and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). Abundant free hydroxyl groups in
the cross-linked films contribute to the antifogging property.34 However, the inferior mechanical properties
of the cross-linked films limited their use as stretchable electric
components. To sum up, hydrogels showed smart intrinsic self-healing
characteristics toward wounds caused by external forces, which is
attributed to sufficient free groups at the scratched interfaces to
reform H-bonds across the interfaces and a sufficient chain mobility
that is indispensable for chain diffusion across the interfaces and
association to reform H-bonds. Therefore, we attempted to use two
polymers with the respective H-bond-donating and -accepting groups
to generate hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complex (HIPC)35 elastomers, which was traditionally used in
the solution state as drug carriers,36,37 with self-healing
property. The stretchable, self-healable HIPC elastomers can be further
used as the flexible substrate of an electric sensor.

Herein,
we reported the design and preparation of a series of HIPC
elastomers, wherein PAA was mixed with different amounts of poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO) or F108 (Scheme 1) to prepare stretchable and healable elastomers as flexible
substrate for the AgNW and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) conductors.
The constituent and composition of the respective PAA/PEO and PAA/F108
systems determine the mechanical and healing properties of the elastomers,
which will be primarily discussed. On the basis of the high extensibility
(1400%) and superior healing property (both ησ and ηε reach 99%), PAA/F108 1/9 was chosen
as the flexible component to prepare the respective AgNW-printed (Ag-p)
and SWCNT-blended (SW-b) electric sensors for study. In the presence
of hard AgNWs (or SWCNT) component, the Ag-p (or SW-b) sensor is nevertheless
a self-healable elastomer capable of detecting bending and stretching
motions and exhibits a high stretchability (>1000%). Moreover,
the
Ag-p and SW-b conductor films were constructed in different configurations,
that is, AgNWs of Ag-p film are deposited as a layer separate from
the polymer substrate, whereas SWCNTs of SW-b film are homogenously
mixed with the polymer substrate. Configurations of the conductor
films thus determined their role as a stable and reliable strain sensor.
Recovery of the conductivity of the strained Ag-p after being released
to the relaxed state can only be attained within small strain (<50%)
range. In contrast, recovery of the electrical property of the relaxed
SW-b sensor can be achieved even after large stretching deformation
(500%). Overall, the present methodology developed paves the way for
practical applications of highly stretchable self-healing strain electronic
devices.

Difference between Ag-p and SW-b Conductor Films
Results and Discussion
Qualitative Evaluation
of the Self-Healing HIPC Blends
PAA/PEO x/y and PAA/F108 x/y (x/y refers to the molar ratio
between H-bond-donating carboxylic acid
and H-bond-accepting oxygen atom of ethylene oxide unit) blends were
prepared and their self-healing behavior can qualitatively be evaluated
from the three experiments illustrated in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Qualitative Evaluations of Self-Healing
Properties for PAA/PEO 1/9
and PAA/F108 1/9 Films
Under conditions of
automatic
recovery (top left), water-assisting recovery (top right), and extension
of the healed specimen (bottom).

First, rubberlike
films of PAA/PEO 1/9 and PAA/F108 1/9 were cut
by a knife (top left) and the cut marks of the rejoined PAA/PEO 1/9
and PAA/F108 1/9 films became invisible at 90 and 60 min after the
cuts, respectively. The inherent soft poly(propylene oxide) (PPO)
block of F108 is responsible for the superior healing efficiency of
PAA/F108 1/9, which will be discussed later.

Second, the externally
added water droplet was found to accelerate
the healing process. As illustrated in Scheme 2 (top right), the wounds covered by water
droplet completely healed after the vaporization of the water droplet
in few seconds. In this case, the water molecules act to mobilize
the hydrophilic PEO and PAA chains in the fracture interphase to close
vicinities to have intimate H-bond interactions, therefore healing
the fracture interphase with accelerated rate. A similar experimental
result was found in H-bonded films38 derived
from complexation of PEO and tannic acid. Instead of adding water
droplets, the fractured PEO/tannic acid sample was exposed to humid
environment to accelerate the healing.

The HIPC blends are all
with high healing efficiency, which can
be primarily evaluated from the third experiments (bottom). The fractured
elastomeric films were cut, rejoined, and left untouched for 30 min
to generate healed specimen for test. The results suggest that the
healed interphases should be very strong because they can sustain
an extension for at least 10 and 14 times the initial lengths of the
PAA/PEO 1/9 and PAA/F108 1/9 films (Movies S1 and S2), respectively. Besides the healing
efficiency, PAA/F108 1/9 is also a better elastomer with higher fracture
strain compared to PAA/PEO 1/9.

Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Analysis
As illustrated
in Scheme 1, the possible
H-bond interactions in the elastomer complexes can be classified into
two modes, self-association between two carboxylic acids of PAA and
interassociation between carboxylic acid of PAA and oxygen atoms of
PEO (or F108). In this respect, FTIR analysis (Figure 1) is a powerful tool for analyzing the possible
H-bond interactions involved in the blends. As reported previously,
conversion of self-associated carboxylic acids39−42 into interassociated carboxylic
acids gradually shifted the carbonyl stretching band to longer wavenumber.
Therefore, the increase of PEO (or F108) content in the blends shifts
the carbonyl stretching band of PEO/PAA (or PEO/F108) from 1718 to
1730 cm–1 (or 1732 cm–1). The
carbonyl stretching band in the corresponding spectral region can
be deconvoluted into self- and interassociated bands. The result (Table S1) coincides with the trend that fraction
of interassociated carbonyl absorption increases with the increase
of PEO (or F108) content in the blend. Enhanced interassociated carbonyl
absorption refers to the prevalent interpolymer interactions of the
HIPC blends.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of (a) PAA/PEO x/y and (b) PAA/F108 x/y blends (magnified
carbonyl stretching bands were shown in the bottom panels).

FTIR analysis also provides information
regarding the major morphological
change of the blended elastomers. Semicrystalline PEO43 exhibits two characteristic crystalline peaks at 1343 and
1360 cm–1 (Figure 2), respectively. In contrast, no such crystalline peaks
are present in the spectra of the blends, which contain only broad
band, representative of the amorphous PEO segments in the elastomers,
over the corresponding absorption region. In the blends, PEO segments
must interassociate with PAA chains intimately, leading to the destruction
of the regular crystalline packing (Figure S4). As a matter of fact, all HIPC blends are amorphous according to
their transparent appearances (Figure S5) and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results provided
below.

Figure 2 Transformations of the characteristic sharp crystalline peaks of
PEO segments chains to the broad, amorphous peaks in the blends of
(a) PAA/PEO x/y and (b) PAA/F108 x/y blends.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Analysis
DSC
analysis provides information regarding the amorphous nature of the
blends (Figure 3).
Before DSC scans, all blended samples needed to be vacuum-dried to
remove the absorbed moisture. No thermal transition can be detected
for all blended samples without preliminary drying. As being semicrystalline,
PEO and F108 exhibit the characteristic melting transitions at 64
and 60 °C, respectively. The crystalline structure of PEO (or
F108) in the blends was nevertheless destructed since all blends exhibit
only amorphous glass transition (Tg) in
their DSC thermograms. As consistent with FTIR analysis, preferable
interassociated H-bond interactions between PAA and PEO (or F108)
resulted in miscible, amorphous blends with single, detected Tg. For pure PAA, its characteristic Tg at 114 °C is no more preserved in the
HIPC blends. The preferable interassociation in the blends results
in the gradual shift of the Tg to lower
temperature when the PEO (or F108) content in the blends increase.
Maximum loads of PEO and F108 in PAA/PEO 1/9 and PAA/F108 1/9 result
in the large shifts of Tgs to 51 and 42
°C, respectively. The resolved Tgs of PAA/F108 x/y are all lower
than those of PAA/PEO x/y with the
same x/y ratio, which suggests that
PAA/F108 blends are softer elastomers with higher chain mobility compared
to PAA/PEO blends.

Figure 3 DSC curves of (a) pure PEO, PAA, and PAA/PEO x/y and (b) pure F108, PAA, and PAA/F108 x/y blends (heating rate = 10 °C min–1).

The HIPC blends discussed
in this study belong to a class of “physical
cross-linked network”, within which the interassociated H-bonded
PEO segments act as the junction points and the rest of the mobile
PEO segments are the bridge units. The increase of PEO content in
the blends increase the fraction of mobile bridge units, which leads
to the lowering of the detected Tg value.
For PAA/F108 system, the PPO segments of F108 are immune from the
restriction of H-bonding and are more mobile units compared to the
PEO segments. Thus, incorporation of PPO chains in PAA/F108 results
in soft blends with lower Tg compared
to PAA/PEO. Soft chains with high mobility are beneficial for the
diffusion of the ruptured segments to near vicinities, redistributing
and activating the interassociated H-bonds to heal the cut or fractured
interphases. With this prospect, PAA/F108 blends should represent
a better healing system compared to PAA/PEO blends, a point that can
be verified by the following mechanical analyses.

Dynamic Mechanical
Analysis (DMA)
The mechanical elastic
properties of the rubberlike films were primarily analyzed by DMA.
The storage modulus (E′) of the PAA/PEO and
PAA/F108 films was given as a function of frequency (0–5 Hz)
in Figure 4a,b, respectively.
The results from both systems suggest that we can tune the film property
by adjusting the content of the soft PEO (or F108) chain in the blends.
A previous study44 indicated that stiffness
and strength of triblock copolymers decrease with increase of the
soft block content. Similarly, softer blends with higher soft PEO
(or F108) content should exhibit lower E′.
Comparatively, PAA/F108 x/y films
all exhibit lower E′ than PAA/PEO x/y films of the same x/y ratio; therefore, PAA/F108 represent a softer
system compared to PAA/PEO. All of the results are correlated with
the DSC analysis. Again, soft chains in the blends favor the segmental
diffusion and facilitate the healing of the cut and fracture surface.
The mobile PPO chain of F108 makes PAA/F108 a better healing system
compared to PAA/PEO, which can be further verified by rheology analysis.

modulus (E′) of (a) PAA/PEO x/y and (b) PAA/F108 x/y blends from DMA.

Rheology Analysis
In general, rheological measurement
provides variation of the time scale involved in the dynamic relaxation
process of the polymer network. Rheology analysis of the present systems
should help evaluate the healing process of the cross-linked HIPC
blends. The resultant elastic (G′) and viscous
(G″) moduli of PAA/PEO and PAA/F108, at frequency
ranging from 0.05 to 126 rad s–1, are given in Figure 5a,b, respectively.
The moduli G′ and G″
of PAA/F108 x/y (x/y = 1/1 and 1/9) blends are all lower than those
of PAA/PEO blends of the same x/y ratio, which is correlated with the DMA result that PAA/F108 is
a softer system compared to PAA/PEO system. Moreover, blends with
higher PEO (or F108) content are also softer than blends with lower
PEO (or F108) content.

Figure 5 Rheological behavior of (a) PAA/PEO x/y and (b) PAA/F108 x/y blends (x/y = 1/1 and 1/9).

The resolved G′ and G″
curves of the rubberlike films all follow similar paths. At low frequency, G″ is greater than G′, which
refers to liquidlike character, while at higher frequency, G′ exceeds G″, which corresponds
to gel-like behavior. For all tested films, transformation from a
low-frequency liquidlike to a high-frequency gel-like states occurs
at the point when G″ intersected G′ (inset, Figure 5). The moduli of PAA/PEO 1/9 intersected at frequency ωc ∼ 8.83 rad s–1, corresponding to
a relaxation time of 1/ωc ∼ 0.113 s, and PAA/F108
1/9 intersected at a frequency ωc ∼ 10.18
rad s–1, corresponding to a fast relaxation time
of 1/ωc ∼ 0.1 s. After the intersecting point,
both curves flattened at higher frequencies and entered into the rubbery
plateau region. Compared to blends with 1/9 ratio, PAA/PEO 1/1 and
PAA/F108 1/1 blends all relaxed with longer relaxation times of 0.44
and 0.16 s, respectively. A previous study on a self-healing ionic
network system45 concluded that materials
with short relaxation time are better in chain mobility and are therefore
superior in healing efficiency than materials with long relaxation
time. In accordance with the above results, PAA/F108 blends represent
better healing system compared to PAA/PEO blends. HIPC blends with
higher PEO (or F108) content are also superior in healing property
to blends with lower PEO (or F108) content.

Figure 6 shows the
robust recovery behavior of PAA/PEO 1/9 and PAA/F108 films by rheological
measurements. The rubberlike films were subjected to oscillatory force
with alternatively changing amplitudes. At a low strain of 1%, G′ is greater than G″, and
both moduli do not change over time, which implies that both films
remained intact under small oscillatory strain. When the applied oscillatory
strain is high at 200%, G′ drops rapidly and
becomes lower than G″ due to the breakage
of physical network. When the applied strain was returned to 1%, the
sample immediately recovered to the initial gel-like state (i.e., G′ > G″) with the same G′ and G″ values as the first
experimental run. Therefore, the disrupted network films were completely
recovered, which confirmed the healing ability of PAA/PEO 1/9 and
PAA/F108 1/9. Disruption and recovery of the gel properties under
different oscillatory shears can be repeatedly conducted for at least
three times without causing any change in the film’s oscillatory
property. In contrast, the G′ and G″ values of PAA/PEO 1/1 and PAA/F108 1/1 deviated
from the first experimental runs (Figure S2) under repeated oscillatory strain. Films with higher PEO (or F108)
content are therefore better in recovery property than films with
lower PEO (or F108) content.

and loss modulus (G″) of (a) PAA/PEO 1/9 and
(b) PAA/F108 1/9 films
under a continuous strain sweep with alternating oscillation strains
of 1 and 200%, respectively.

Tensile Test
To further evaluate the self-healing ability
of the blend films, tensile tests were performed in both the virgin
(uncut) and healed PAA/PEO 1/9 (Figure 7a) and PAA/F108 1/9 (Figure 7b) films, respectively. The virgin PAA/PEO
1/9 and PAA/F108 1/9 films are all good elastomers with a fracture
strain (εf) of 1100% at a fracture stress (σf) of ∼0.45 MPa and with εf of 1400%
at a σf of ∼0.15 MPa, respectively. To the
best of our knowledge, εf (1400%) of PAA/F108 1/9
is the highest strain value reported so far for the self-healing polymeric
materials.46−48 Benefiting from the reversible H-bond interactions,
the healed PAA/PEO 1/9 and PAA/F108 1/9 films are also good elastomers
with a common feature that both σf and εf values increased with healing time. If the automatic healing
process was allowed to proceed for a long period, i.e., 24 h, the
healed PAA/PEO 1/9 and PAA/F108 1/9 actually approached the initial,
virgin states according to the resolved values of εf = 1000% and σf = 0.39 MPa for the healed PAA/PEO
1/9, and εf = 1309% and σf = 0.15
MPa for the healed PAA/F108 1/9.

Figure 7 Stress–strain curves of virgin
and self-healing films of
(a) PAA/PEO 1/9 and (b) PAA/F108 1/9; stress healing efficiencies
of (c) PAA/PEO x/y and (d) PAA/F108 x/y; and strain healing efficiencies of
(e) PAA/PEO x/y and (f) PAA/F108 x/y at various healing times.

Performances of the healed films can be easily
evaluated from the
healing efficiencies ηε and ησ of the healed PAA/PEO x/y (Figure 7c,d) and PAA/F108 x/y (Figure 7e,f), respectively. In general, a long healing time
is beneficial for the healing efficiencies and films with higher PEO
(or F108) content have higher healing efficiencies compared to films
with lower PEO (or F108) content. Moreover, PAA/F108 x/y is superior in healing efficiency, with the resolved
ηε and ησ values higher
than those of PAA/PEO x/y. The calculated
ησ and ηε are 86 and
90% for PAA/PEO 1/9, and 95 and 94% for PAA/F108, respectively. All
of these results are correlated with the comment that softer (or more
flexible) chains are beneficial for segmental diffusion of the H-bonding
groups and therefore facilitate the recovery of the healed films.

It is also interesting to examine the effect of water droplet regarding
the accelerated water-assisting healing process illustrated in Scheme 2. Primarily, water
droplet was dripped on the cut surfaces of the sample film and the
surfaces were rejoined and left untouched for different times before
the tensile analysis. Representative stress–strain curves from
the water-assisting healed films of PAA/PEO 1/9 (Figure 8a) and PAA/F108 1/9 (Figure 8b) illustrate the
beneficial role of healing time for the tensile property of healed
films. The calculated healing efficiencies from the water-assisting
healing process were compared to those from automatic healing in Figure 8. It is then clear
that water droplets are beneficial for the recovery of the damaged
films. Healing of the blends were accelerated by water droplet according
to the resolved ησ and ηε: 88 and 98% for PAA/PEO 1/9, and 99 and 99% for PAA/F108, respectively.

films of (a) PAA/PEO 1/9 and (b) PAA/F108 1/9; stress healing efficiencies
of virgin and water-assisting healed films of (c) PAA/PEO 1/9 and
(d) PAA/F108 1/9; and strain healing efficiencies of virgin and water-assisting
healed films of (e) PAA/PEO 1/9 and (f) PAA/F108 1/9 at various healing
times.

Conductivity Films
With the superior mechanical properties,
PAA/F108 1/9 was selected as the base material to construct the healable
and stretchable conductor sensor. Primarily, AgNWs was used as the
conductor to build up Ag-p sensor film. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of the as-printed AgNWs (Figure 9a) was found to be randomly stacked and distributed
on the surface of PAA/F108 1/9 film, forming a network structure whose
junctions led to the conductivity of the film. Here, besides elongated
nanowires in straight geometry, we also observed some curly AgNWs
in the network structure. The adhesion between the deposited AgNWs
layer and the rubberlike film should be enough to sustain the bending
motion (Figure 9b)
for more than 100 times without any visual delamination of the deposited
AgNWs layer. The flexible Ag-p conductor film was also applied as
a self-healing conductor in a circuit (Figure 9c).49,50 The flexible conductor
film is conductive enough to transmit electricity in a circuit to
an LED. The LED immediately went off after the conductor film was
cut into two pieces. However, by bringing the two separated pieces
into contact, the conductor film was recovered to result in the light-up
of LED. Moreover, the conductance of the flexible Ag-p film could
be maintained when the sample was bent (Figure 9d). The above result suggests that this flexible
Ag-p conductor can be applied as a wearable sensor capable of detecting
bending motion.

Figure 9 (a) SEM image of the as-printed AgNWs on the top of PAA/F108

elastomer; (b) flexible Ag-p conductor film with bending, and a series
of photos demonstrating that the conductance of the healed Ag-p films
(c) after being cut and (d) after being bent can be well restored
to result in the light-up of integrated LED again.

The Ag-p conductor film was attached onto a glove
(Figure 10a) for the
detection of finger
joint bending. When the finger bent, the resistance gradually increases
from ∼30 Ω to a maximum of ∼70 Ω. The reversible
change of the resistance from ∼30 to ∼70 Ω, corresponding
to the bending or releasing of the finger, is clearly visible over
the cycles. The electric resistance ratio (R/R0) (Figure 10b) of the Ag-p conductor film is rather constant about
100% over the 100 bending–releasing cycles. Therefore, the
Ag-p sensor can be employed for accurate motion detection of finger
joints and could be used as electric skin for robots.

Figure 10 (a) Resistance variation
of the bent Ag-p conductor film over different
bending times. (b) Electric resistance ratio (R/R0) and resistance changes of Ag-p conductor
films with strains (c) 800% and (d) 50%.

The possibility of using Ag-p conductor film as a self-healing
strain sensor was then explored. The Ag-p conductor film can be stretched
up to ∼800% without visual fracture of the film. Regarding
the good conductivity of AgNWs, the initial resistance of the conductor
film is low (60–70 Ω, Figure 10c). Afterward, the resistance of the film
exhibited a sudden jump at a strain of 100% and then increased monotonously
to attain a final value of 1.68 × 107 Ω at a
strain of 800%. For Ag-p, applying a strain beyond 100% caused the
failure of resistance recovery. The Ag-p film nevertheless exhibits
reliable response to small strain (Figure 10d), that is, a small strain of 50% contributes
to little change of the conductive path and therefore, the resistance
of the restored film is the same with the initial value. Displacement
of AgNWs and decrease of conductive junction points51 were suggested to be responsible for the failure of AgNW-printed
polyurethane at a strain <100%. However, besides these two possible
causes present in the AgNWs layer, the failure mode in the interfacial
zone should not be overlooked. As the strain increases, certain AgNWs
in the interfacial zone would detach from the polymer substrate, resulting
in loss of some conductive paths and the increase of resistance. Extra
interfacial zone therefore adds potential failure mode to the Ag-p
conductor film.

In contrast to the separate AgNWs layer in Ag-p,
the SWCNT conductors
of SW-b were directly blended with the HIPC elastomers, forming a
miscible system with high sustainability to large strain deformation.
The SEM image taken from the vacuum-dried SW-b film is shown in Figure 11a, which exhibits
the main feature that the polymer-coated SWCNTs were interconnected
with each other and were surrounded by the polymer matrix. As the
polymer-coated SWCNTs are intimately and homogeneously connected with
the elastomeric polymer matrix, the SW-b conductor film is therefore
highly stretchable in sustaining high strain. A large strain of 1000%
caused a little deviation of the resistance value when the stretched
film was relaxed back to the initial length (Figure 11b). With a lower applied strain of 500%,
the relaxed SW-b film exhibited the complete recovery of the resistance
to the initial value (Figure 11b, inset) before stretch. Therefore, SW-b is a more reliable
stain sensor compared to Ag-p. The healable SW-b film is a ultrastable
strain sensor as it exhibited a reversible resistance strain response
over 200 stretching release cycles within a high strain range of 500%.
Moreover, the electric resistance ratio (R/R0) (Figure 11c) of the SW-b conductor film is quite stable under
the bending motion, which remains about 100% over the 150 bending
release cycles. The R/R0 values of the sensor remain almost constant with minor fluctuations
within 10% in the first 200 cycles strain test (Figure 11d) (between 0 and 500% strain).
We thereby suggest that the SW-b conductor film is an ultrastable
sensor under bending motion and high strain.

electric resistance ratio of the bent SW-b film over different bending
times; and (d) electric resistance ratio of the bent SW-b film over
different stretching times from 0 to 500% strain.

The key parameters of several previous strain sensors,52−59 including healable and nonhealable sensors, are listed in Table 1 to compare with the
results from the present Ag-p and SW-b sensors. In this work, the
healable SW-b strain sensor that we fabricated can sustain a large
strain (>1000%), which made it suitable for broad applications
and
exhibits a good balance between high sensitivity and stability. Among
the healable sensors,52−54 the SWCNT/PVA/borax52 sensor
is a superior strain sensor with a large ΔR/R0 ratio of 1514% in a large strain
range of 1000%. However, this superior strain sensor required the
use of adhesion tapes as protective layers to prevent quick vaporization
of the absorbed water from the PVA/borax hydrogels. The rest of the
sensors55−59 containing carbon-based conductive fibers is either limited in stretching
ability or nonhealable. Without the use of extra adhesion tapes, our
SW-b conductor film is healable, highly stretchable, and exhibits
stable electric response toward a high strain of 500%. Also, the Ag-p
sensor film shows high sensitivity with a large ΔR/R0 (ΔR = R – R0, in which R0 is the resistance at 0% strain and R is the resistance under stretch) ratio of 100 000%
in the strain range of 800%, comparable to that from gold-deposited
supramolecular polymeric materials53 sensor
within a smaller strain of 400%.

Conclusions
HIPC
blends of PAA/PEO x/y and
PAA/F108 x/y are all elastomers
with self-healing properties. The results suggest that blends with
higher x/y (e.g., 1/9) ratio are
softer materials with higher stretchability and healing efficiencies
than blends with lower x/y ratio.
With the built-in soft PPO block of F108, the PAA/F108 x/y blends are also better system with higher stretchability
and healing efficiency than PAA/PEO x/y blends. Among all blends, PAA/F108 1/9 exhibits the best results
with the resolved εf of 1400% at a σf of ∼0.15 MPa, and ησ and ηε of the healed blend of 95 and 94%, respectively. PAA/F108
1/9 was further incorporated with AgNWs and SWCNT to construct Ag-p
and SW-b conductor films, respectively. Although inferior in the large
strain stability, the highly conductive Ag-p film is nevertheless
ultrasensitive with a large ΔR/R0 ratio of 100 000% in the strain range of 800%.
In contrast, the SW-b film is an ultrastable strain sensor, showing
a stable R/R0 ratio over
200 stretching release cycles in the strain range of 500%. The low
cost of this HIPC strategy makes it a potential commercial route for
fabricating flexible, healable conductor sensors.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The chemical compounds used are PAA (Mw ∼ 100 000, 35 wt % in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich), PEO (Mw ∼
14 000, Sigma-Aldrich), Pluronic F108 (Mw ∼ 14 600 with 82.5 wt % of PEO, Sigma-Aldrich),
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw ∼
58 000, Sigma-Aldrich), ethylene glycol (EG, Alfa Aeser), AgNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), iron(III) chloride (Acros), and SWCNT-2012
(length <2 μm, purity >97%, Golden Innovation Business
Co.,
Ltd.). The glass substrates used in this work was cleaned by sonication
in 2-propanol/water (v/v = 1/1) for 20 min and washed with ultrapure
water three times before drying in a vacuum oven. AgNWs used in this
work were synthesized according to the reported method.51

Preparation of AgNWs
AgNWs used
in this work were synthesized
according to the reported method.51 The
typical experiments were described as follows: 20 mL of ethylene glycol
(EG) was injected into a 50 mL three-necked flask and preheated for
30 min; silver nitrate (0.33 g) was added within 10 s while 20 mL
of EG solution of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw ≈ 58 000) (0.88 g) and FeCl3 (0.0027
g) was injected dropwise by a syringe within 5 min, and then the reaction
was maintained at 170 °C for 80 min. The as-obtained products
were then filtered and washed by methanol several times, and the purified
products were preserved in ethanol.

Preparation of HIPC Films
A calculated amount of PEO
(or F108) in methanol (5 mL) was added dropwise into a stirred solution
of a calculated amount of PAA in methanol (5 mL). The resultant homogeneous
solution was then slowly deposited on Teflon substrate. The resultant
solution mixtures were dried in open air for 1 day, rendering transparent
rubberlike films for study.

Preparation of Ag-p Conductor Film
Typically, 1 mL
of ethanol suspension of AgNWs (25 mg mL–1) was
dropped on top of a glass substrate before drying in open air for
1 day to obtain AgNW-decorated glass substrate. A clean PAA/PEO 1/9
(or PAA/F108 1/9) film was then pressed on the AgNW-decorated glass
substrate and then peeled off to result in a AgNW-printed conductive
film of PAA/PEO 1/9 (or PAA/F108 1/9).

Preparation of SW-b Conductor
Film
The films were prepared
by adding a calculated amount of F108 in methanol (5 mL) dropwise
into a stirred solution of a calculated amount of PAA in methanol
(5 mL), then adding 33 wt % of SWCNT into the resultant homogeneous
solution, and then allowing the solution to dry in open air for 1
day.

Characterization
FTIR spectra were recorded by a Bruker
Tensor 27 FTIR spectrophotometer. The complex solution was deposited
on a premade KBr pellet, and the whole assembly was dried in a vacuum
oven to prepare specimen for analysis. Thermal transition of the complex
was determined by a TA-Q20 differential scanning calorimeter with
a scan rate of 10 °C min–1. The storage modulus
(E′) of the films was determined from a PerkinElmer
Instruments DMA 8000 apparatus. Sample films with dimensions of 25
mm × 10 mm × 2 mm were used for analysis. Rheology data
were obtained by a TA Instruments ARES G2 rheometer equipped with
a 2.5 mm parallel plate. Samples with 2 mm diameter were used. Angular
frequency from 0.05 to 126 rad s–1 was collected
at a strain amplitude of 0.05%, which was within the linear viscoelastic
response region. The recovery property was investigated by strain
films under an alternatively changing amplitude of oscillatory force
at 1 Hz. Tensile test was conducted by a PRO TEST PT-1699 V tensile
tester with an extension speed of 30 mm min–1. Films
with dimensions of 15 mm × 5 mm × 2 mm were used for analysis.
The stress healing efficiency (ησ) was calculated
by the formula ησ = σf,h/σf,v, where σf,v and σf,h are
the fracture stresses of the virgin and self-healed samples, respectively.
The strain healing efficiency (ηε) was calculated
by the formula ηε = εf,h/εf,v, where εf,v and εf,h are
the fracture strain of the virgin and self-healed samples, respectively.
SEM images were obtained by a JEOL JSM-6700F microscope operated at
10 kV. The resistance was measured on a Tonghui TH2829 LCR meter.
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) spectra were obtained from a Siemens
D5000 diffractometer. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded
on an Ocean Optics DT 1000 CE 376 spectrophotometer.
