Three, PO43–/HPO42– and AsO43–-incorporated, new tetranuclear
complexes of copper(II) and zinc(II) ions have been synthesized and
fully characterized. In methanol–water, reactions of H3cpdp (H3cpdp = N,N′-Bis[2-carboxybenzomethyl]-N,N′-Bis[2-pyridylmethyl]-1,3-diaminopropan-2-ol) with copper(II)
chloride in the presence of either NaOH/Na2HPO4·2H2O or KOH/Na2HAsO4·7H2O lead to the isolation of the tetranuclear complexes Na3[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-PO4)](OH)2·14H2O (1)
and K2[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-AsO4)](OH)·162/3H2O (2), respectively. Similarly, the reaction of H3cpdp with zinc(II) chloride in the presence of NaOH/Na2HPO4·2H2O yields a tetranuclear
complex, Na(H3O)2[Zn4(cpdp)2(μ4-HPO4)]Cl3·121/2H2O (3). All complexes
are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and other analytical
techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared and UV−vis spectroscopy,
thermogravimetric and electrochemical studies. The solid-state molecular
framework of each complex contains two monocationic [M2(cpdp)]+ (M = Cu, Zn) units, which are exclusively coordinated
to either phosphate/hydrogen phosphate or arsenate groups in a unique
mode. All three complexes exhibit a μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 bridging mode of the PO43–/HPO42–/AsO43– groups,
with each bridging among four metal ions. The thermal properties of
all three complexes have been investigated by thermogravimetric analysis.
Low-temperature magnetic studies of complexes 1 and 2 disclose moderate antiferromagnetic interactions mediated
among the copper centers through alkoxide and phosphate/arsenate bridges.
Electrochemical studies of complexes 1 and 2 in dimethylformamide using cyclic voltammetry reveal the presence
of a fairly assessable one-electron metal-based irreversible reduction
and one quasireversible oxidation couple.

Introduction
Polynuclear transition
metal complexes have attracted interest
as mimics of active sites of several biological systems1 and in materials chemistry, especially in the
field of molecular magnetism.2,3 In this regard, the
use of polyoxoanions of group 15 (P and As) in the synthesis of polynuclear
metal complexes has increased significantly not only due to their
biological implication, as the metal ions of this group are greatly
involved in phosphate metabolism, but also due to their potential
role as mediators of magnetic exchange interactions.4−6 Tetrahedrally disposed polyoxoanions of group 15 propagate ferromagnetic
coupling between copper centers, as proposed by Hendrickson and co-workers.7 These oxo-anions, such as phosphate and arsenate,
have a strong binding capability with transition metal ions. The presence
of four oxygen donor
sites may allow phosphate and arsenate to coordinate to as many as
12 metal ions (Scheme 1), although several different coordination modes are possible.8 Despite their potential binding competency, the
transition metal complexes/clusters involving inorganic phosphate/hydrogen
phosphate and arsenate are still sparse, mainly due to the difficulties
in preparation, tendency to form layered complexes, and low crystalline
properties of such reaction products. Thus, inorganic phosphate/hydrogen
phosphate- and arsenate-based molecular clusters involving copper(II)
and zinc(II), with attractive topologies, are very limited.4,9−17 A literature search also shows that some diphosphonate- and triphosphonate-based
transition metal complexes featuring interesting luminescence and
magnetic properties have been investigated very recently.18,19

Scheme 1 Maximum Possible Coordination Modes of PO43– and AsO43– Groups
Kruger and co-workers20 have reported
the synthesis and characterization of a μ4-PO4-bridged tetranuclear copper(II) complex possessing a butterfly
topology. Recently, synthesis, structural characterization, and evaluation
of the magnetic properties of PO4- and AsO4-bridged
tetranuclear copper complexes of a phenol-based multidentate ligand
have been carried out systematically by Schindler and co-workers.15 Gahan and co-workers21 have reported an octanuclear zinc cluster of carboxylate containing
a multidentate ligand, which is a tetramer of dinuclear complexes,
bridged by two phosphate groups and bifurcating acetic acid arms.
Our recent interest has been the preparation of tetra- and hexanuclear
complexes of nickel, copper, and zinc using several alkoxide and carboxylate-based
multidentate ligands and their characterization and applications.22−25 These ligands consist of a flexible backbone with several carboxylate
groups, which may offer extra possibilities toward the formation of
frameworks with interesting topologies. Taking this into consideration,
two isostructural oxo-anions, that is, phosphate and arsenate, triggered
our interest with regard to their binding properties with copper(II)
and zinc(II) ions in conjunction with the multidentate ligand H3cpdp. In this study, we report three new tetranuclear complexes
of copper(II) and zinc(II) with Cu4(μ4-PO4), Cu4(μ4-AsO4), and Zn4(μ4-HPO4) cores
showing rare coordination chemistry. Furthermore, the magnetic, electrochemical,
and thermal properties of these new complexes have been investigated
and the results are reported herein.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses
and General Characterization
The polydentate
ligand H3cpdp was prepared and characterized following
our previously published procedure.26 Reactions
of H3cpdp with copper(II) and zinc(II) in the presence
of phosphate and arsenate salts have been systematically investigated
to explore the roles of these oxo-anions in the formation and stabilization
of polymetallic complexes, as depicted in Scheme 2. A mixture of CuCl2·2H2O, H3cpdp, and Na2HPO4·2H2O in a 4:2:1 molar ratio, respectively, in the presence of
NaOH, in methanol–water (4:1; v/v) was allowed to react for
1 h at room temperature. The produced blue solution was then filtered
and evaporated naturally, yielding a blue tetranuclear complex, Na3[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-PO4)](OH)2·14H2O (1).
The blue tetranuclear complex K2[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-AsO4)](OH)·162/3H2O (2) was synthesized in a
similar manner except that Na2HPO4·2H2O and NaOH were replaced by Na2HAsO4·7H2O and KOH as reagents in the reaction. However,
the pale yellow tetranuclear complex Na(H3O)2[Zn4(cpdp)2(μ4-HPO4)]Cl3·121/2H2O (3) was formed by the reaction of ZnCl2 with H3cpdp and Na2HPO4·2H2O in a 4:2:1 molar ratio, respectively, in the presence of NaOH,
in methanol–water (4:1; v/v) under refluxing conditions followed
by cooling of the reaction solution to room temperature. X-ray quality
single crystals of 3 were obtained by slow evaporation
of the light yellow filtrate.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Route of the Complexes
The complexes were fully characterized
by elemental analysis, Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR), UV–vis, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray crystallography.
Elemental analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction study established
the compositions of complexes 1–3.

X-ray Structural Characterization of the Complexes
The molecular
structures of 1–3 were
determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Whereas complexes 1 and 2 crystallized in an orthorhombic system
and their structures were solved in the Pbcn space
group, complex 3 crystallized in a monoclinic system
and its structure was solved in the I2/a space group. Crystallographic parameters of the complexes are given
in Table 1. Selected
interatomic distances and angles are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

Crystal Structure of Na3[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-PO4)](OH)2·14H2O (1)
The structural representation,
with atom connectivity, of complex 1 is depicted in Figure 1. The X-ray crystal
structure of 1 consists of a neutral core complex, [NaCu4(cpdp)2(μ4-PO4)], two
Na+ and two OH– ions as counterions,
and 14 lattice water molecules. The OH– ions are
associated with solvent water molecules and cannot be localized properly.
The core of complex 1 is composed of one sodium(I) and
four copper(II) ions, two cpdp3– ligands, and one
μ4-PO43– group. Two
dicopper units, [Cu2(cpdp)]+, in 1 are coordinated exclusively by a bridging phosphate group in a μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 tetradentate manner. Both dicopper units exhibit
identical coordination geometries, bond distances, and bond angles
around the metal centers and the cpdp3– ligand.
As indicated by the values of structural indices27 (τ = 0.273 for Cu1 and τ = 0.038 for Cu2),
Cu1 is in a highly distorted square pyramidal geometry and Cu2 is
in a slightly distorted square pyramidal geometry. The basal plane
of the coordination geometry around each copper center is formed by
a bridging alkoxide oxygen, a tertiary amine nitrogen, a pyridyl nitrogen
of cpdp3–, and a phosphate oxygen atom. The apical
position around each copper center is occupied by a benzoate oxygen
atom of cpdp3–. The deviations of the copper centers
from the basal planes are 0.166 (Cu1) and 0.222 Å (Cu2). The
equatorial Cu—Oalkoxide and axial Cu—Ocarboxylate bond distances range from 1.924(4) to 1.932(4)
Å and 2.232(4) to 2.262(4) Å, respectively.26,28 The μ4-bridging mode of the phosphate group with
four copper centers makes four Cu—O—P bonds, with an
average Cu—O—P bond angle of 129.04°. The P—O
bond distances and O—P—O bond angles are in the range
of 1.533(4)–1.537(4) Å and 110.7(2)–112.0(2)°,
respectively. The intramolecular separation between the copper centers
bridged by the alkoxide oxygen atom of cpdp3– is
much shorter, whereas the separation between the copper centers bridged
by the phosphate anion is considerably longer [3.5221(16) vs 5.2974(5)
Å]. It is interesting to note that the four copper centers in
the tetranuclear unit assemble at the corners of a parallelogram (Figure 2).

A substantial number of dicopper complexes bridged by organic
phosphates
are known in the literature.29−34 However, neither the dicopper nor the tetracopper complexes with
bridging inorganic phosphate have appeared to significantly cover
all aspects of interactions between the copper ion and phosphate.
Thus, the μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 binding mode of inorganic
phosphate is quite exceptional, and until now, only few structurally
characterized copper complexes with the μ4-PO4—Cu4 coordination mode are known in the
literature.15,20,35,36

Crystal Structure of K2[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-AsO4)](OH)·162/3H2O (2)
The
X-ray crystal
structure of 2 is presented in Figure 3. Analysis of the structure reveals that
the molecular core of complex 2 is isostructural to that
of complex 1, with two K+ ions and one OH– ion present as the counterions. This OH– ion is associated with the solvent water molecules and cannot be
localized properly. Similar to 1, complex 2 is produced by the self-assembly of two dinuclear [Cu2(cpdp)]+ units bridged by an arsenate group in a μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 tetradentate manner. Calculation of the structural
indices27 indicates that the coordination
geometry around the Cu1 center (τ = 0.007) is square pyramidal
and that around the Cu2 center (τ = 0.350) is highly distorted
square pyramidal. The N2O3 coordination environment
around Cu1 and Cu2 is provided by a bridging alkoxide oxygen, a tertiary
amine nitrogen, a pyridyl nitrogen of cpdp3–, an
arsenate oxygen atom at the basal plane, and a benzoate oxygen atom
of cpdp3– at the apical position. The copper centers
deviate from the basal plane by 0.198 Å (Cu1) and 0.158 Å
(Cu2). The separation between the two copper centers within a cpdp3–-bridged dicopper unit is 3.5812(1) Å, which
is similar to the distance found in complex 1. However,
the separation between two copper centers bridged by an arsenate anion
is 5.3762(1) Å, which is much longer than the separation between
phosphate-bridged Cu···Cu found in complex 1. Similar to that observed in complex 1, the four copper
centers in the core of complex 2 occupy the corners of
a parallelogram (Figure 4). The average Cu—O—As bond angle is 123.79°,
the As—O bond distance is 1.686(2) Å, and the O—As—O
bond angles are in the range of 109.39(13)–112.56(11)°.
The potassium ions in complex 2 reside in a distorted
octahedral geometry surrounded by water oxygen atoms.

Careful search of the literature shows that only one structurally
characterized tetranuclear copper complex with the μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination mode of the AsO43– ion is known.15 However, reports on some
dinuclear copper(II) complexes and polyoxometallates that contain
bridged arsenate or hydrogen arsenate ions with a Cu—O—As
linkage are published in the literature.37−40 Hence, complex 2 represents the second example of a tetradentate
copper complex with the μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination mode
of the AsO43– group.

Crystal Structure
of Na(H3O)2[Zn4(cpdp)2(μ4-HPO4)]Cl3·121/2H2O (3)
A representation
of the molecular structure of complex 3 is presented
in Figure 5. Close
examination of the X-ray crystal structure reveals
that the complex contains a [Zn4(cpdp)2(μ4-HPO4)] unit; one Na+, two H3O+, and three Cl– ions as counterions;
and twelve and a half water molecules of crystallization. The core
of complex 3 consists of two [Zn2(cpdp)]+ units bridged by a HPO42– ion
in a μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 manner. Within each [Zn2(cpdp)]+ unit, the two zinc centers are bridged and chelated by an
alkoxide oxygen of cpdp3– and a —O—P—O—
linkage of HPO42–. In the tetranuclear
unit, four zinc centers sit at the corners of a quadrilateral feature,
with edge lengths of 3.575(1), 5.195(3), 3.630(4), and 5.254(3) Å
(Figure 6). The Zn1,
Zn2, Zn3, and Zn4 centers assume a distorted trigonal bipyramidal
geometry (Figure 6),
as confirmed by the values of structural indices (τ = 0.935
for Zn1, τ = 0.528 for Zn2, τ = 0.775 for Zn3, and τ
= 0.831 for Zn4).27 The trigonal bipyramidal
coordination environment around each zinc center is surrounded by
a bridging alkoxide oxygen, a pyridyl nitrogen, and a carboxylate
oxygen of cpdp3– in the basal plane and a tertiary
amine nitrogen of cpdp3– and a hydrogen phosphate
oxygen atom at the apical positions. The coordination environment
of the countercation, Na+, may be best explained by the
distorted octahedral geometry, with water and carboxylate oxygen atoms.
The Zn—Oalkoxide, Zn—Ocarboxylate, and Zn—Namine bond distances are comparable to
the values reported for some alkoxide-bridged di- and polynuclear
zinc complexes.41−45

Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

To balance the total charge, three protons have to be present
in
the structure. However, the protons could not be located precisely
from Fourier density map. This is because the basicity of the PO43– group is much higher than that of water;
most probably, one proton is located at the PO43– group, resulting in a μ4-bridging of the HPO42– unit. This is further supported by the
inhomogeneous P—O bond distances. The P1—O12 bond, which
is the shortest (1.427(9) Å), may be a P=O double bond,
whereas the P1—O14 and P1—O11 bonds (1.534(4) and 1.539(6)
Å, respectively) may be P—O single bonds. The fourth bond,
P1—O13, is much longer than the other bonds (1.603(8) Å),
which supports bonding to a proton. The remaining two protons are
most probably delocalized over all solvent water molecules. The Zn—O—P
and O—P—O bond angles are in the range of 120.9(3)–132.5(5)°
and 103.0(3)–116.1(4)°, respectively. The average Zn···Zn
separation within the cpdp3–-bridged dizinc unit
is 3.602 Å, whereas the average separation between two zinc centers
across a phosphate bridge is 5.224 Å.

Here, it is noteworthy
that the X-ray structure of complex 3 features one coordinated
benzoate arm and one coordinated
pyridyl arm at one half of the dinuclear [Zn2] unit facing
toward one coordinated pyridyl arm and one coordinated benzoate arm
at the other half of the dinuclear [Zn2] unit. Because
of such a face-to-face sequential arrangement of benzoate–pyridyl–pyridyl–benzoate
functionalities, moderate intramolecular π···π
stacking interactions (Figure S1, Supporting
Information) have been observed between the adjacent benzoate–pyridyl,
pyridyl–pyridyl, and pyridyl–benzoate rings, with average
closest contacts of 3.680, 3.618, and 3.709 Å, respectively.

Structural Comparison of the Complexes 1–3
In all three complexes,
two dinuclear [M2(cpdp)]+ units (M = Cu and
Zn) are assembled onto bridging PO43–/HPO42– or AsO43– groups. In all of the complexes, the PO43–/HPO42– or AsO43– ions display a μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 bridging mode, connecting
all four copper or zinc centers. The occurrence of such a tetradentate
bridging mode of PO43–/HPO42–/AsO43– groups helps
stabilize the molecular structures of the complexes. Among the three
sodium ions present in 1, one provides the necessary
factors for stabilization of the core of the complex and the other
two sodium ions act as countercations. On the other hand, the sodium
ion present in 3 acts only as a countercation. All copper
centers in complexes 1 and 2 adopt a distorted
square pyramidal geometry, whereas all zinc centers in 3 exhibit a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Whereas the four
copper centers in 1 and 2 are assembled
at the corners of a parallelogram, the four zinc centers in 3 are assembled at the corners of an irregular quadrilateral.
Moderate intramolecular π···π stacking
interactions are observed in complex 3 due to face-to-face
sequential arrangement of the benzoate–pyridyl–pyridyl–benzoate
functionalities, but no such kind of interactions is present in complexes 1 and 2.

On comparing the structural features
of 1–3 with those in the literature
reports, one can say that the μ4-bridging mode of
inorganic phosphate/hydrogen phosphate is limited to polyoxometallates46,47 and layered infinite sheets.48,49 Generally, a phosphate
ion is known to be able to bind two metal centers, and such structures
are of particular interest for modeling the active site of purple
acid phosphatases.50−53 In contrast to the μ2:η1:η1, μ3:η1:η1:η1, and μ4:η2:η1:η1 bridging modes of PO43–/HPO42– groups
observed in various transition metal complexes,5,9,20,54,55 the μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 bridging mode is
less known.15 Again, the μ4-bridging mode of the inorganic AsO43– ion is less common, and compared with those with the μ2:η1:η1 bridging mode, only
a small number of transition metal complexes containing the μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 bridging mode are known in the literature.15

Spectroscopic Investigation of the Complexes
In the
FT-IR spectra (Figures S2–S4), the
νC=N stretching frequencies are observed at
∼1608 cm–1 for all three complexes, indicating
the presence of pyridyl functionality of the ligand backbone. The
occurrence of metal-bound carboxylate groups is manifested by the
strong asymmetric νas(COO–) and
symmetric νs(COO–) vibrations at
1588 and 1378 cm–1 for 1, 1586 and
1377 cm–1 for 2, and 1592 and 1382
cm–1 for 3. The relatively higher differences
of Δ (Δ = νas(COO–)
– νs(COO–)) of ∼210,
209, and 210 cm–1 for 1, 2, and 3, respectively, are indicative of terminal binding
of carboxylate groups.56 Strong bands at
1028 and 890 cm–1 for 1, 936 and 841
cm–1 for 2, and 1024 and 910 cm–1 for 3 are detected in the FT-IR spectra
due to the Cu—O—P, Cu—O—As, and Zn—O—P
asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations, respectively.57−60

All three complexes are fairly soluble in methanol, and we
carried out their spectroscopic characterization by recording electronic
absorption spectra (Figures S5–S7) in the range of 200–900 nm. The broad absorption bands with
maxima at 719 nm (ε, 452 M–1 cm–1) and 716 nm (ε, 377 M–1 cm–1) for complexes 1 and 2, respectively,
correspond to d–d transitions. Intense absorption bands at
261 nm (ε, 41 484 M–1 cm–1), 260 nm (ε, 39 524 M–1 cm–1), and 264 nm (ε, 15 090 M–1 cm–1) are observed for complexes 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and are due to metal
ion-bound ligand-based charge-transfer transitions. The electronic
absorption spectra of the complexes have been compared to those of
the free ligand, H3cpdp. In methanol, the spectrum of free
H3cpdp shows three highly intense absorption bands at 254
nm (ε, 218 835 M–1 cm–1)sh, 261 nm (ε, 240 441 M–1 cm–1), and 268 nm (ε, 182 728 M–1 cm–1)sh in the charge-transfer
region (Figure S8). Upon binding of metal
ions, the bands at 254 nm (ε, 218 835 M–1 cm–1)sh and 268 nm (ε, 182 728
M–1 cm–1)sh disappeared.

Furthermore, to gain insight into the behavior of the complexes
in aqueous solution, the UV–vis spectra of 1–3 in water (pH ∼ 7.5), acidic (pH ∼ 5)/alkaline
(pH ∼ 9) solutions, and in the solid state were recorded. The
solid-state UV–vis spectra of 1 and 2 exhibit broad d–d transitions at ∼715 and 713 nm,
respectively, which is in agreement with the observation in water
(Figures S9a, S10a, S12a, and S13a). Moreover,
the bands at ∼262, 260, and 261 nm in the charge-transfer region
for 1, 2, and 3, respectively,
in the solid state are in accordance with the bands observed in water
(Figures S9b, S10b, S11, S12b, S13b, and S14). In contrast, the solid-state UV–vis spectra of 1–3 indicate minor changes in both the d–d
and charge-transfer regions when compared to the spectra obtained
for acidic/alkaline solutions (Figures S15 and S16). To check the stability of the complexes in water, the
absorbances at 715 and 713 nm for representative complexes 1 and 2, respectively, were monitored with time for ∼24
h. As shown from the absorbance versus time plots (Figures S17 and S18), there is no decay of these absorption
bands. On the other hand, the absorbance versus time plots (Figures S19 and S20) obtained upon monitoring
the absorbances at 715 and 713 nm for 1 and 2, respectively, in acidic/alkaline solutions with time for ∼24
h show a gradual decay of these absorption bands. Hence, it can be
concluded that the solid-state structures of complexes 1–3 are retained for an extended period of time
only in water but not in acidic/alkaline solutions. Therefore, all
three complexes are stable in water, whereas they are relatively unstable
in acidic/alkaline solutions. Careful search of the literature has
shown that the stability of some metal clusters has been established
by electronic spectroscopy in solution.61,62

In the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S21), complex 3 shows broad multiplets in the range of
2.72–4.53 ppm, corresponding to the 24 —CH2— and 2 >CH— protons. The presence of 32 aromatic
protons
has been demonstrated by broad multiplets in the range of 6.79–8.33
ppm. In the 13C NMR spectrum of complex 3 (Figure S22), one resonance peak at 176.35 ppm
is observed in the downfield region due to the presence of a monodentate
terminal benzoate carbon. 13C NMR signals appeared in the
range of 51.81–63.72 and 122.88–157.57 ppm, corresponding
to aliphatic and aromatic carbons, respectively.

Magnetic Properties
The susceptibilities of complexes 1 and 2 were investigated in the temperature
range of 2–300 K under an applied magnetic field of 1 T. The
χMT versus T plots
of complexes 1 and 2 are illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. The solid lines correspond to the best fitting
of the curves.

Figure 7 Temperature dependence of χMT for complex 1. The red solid line corresponds to the
best fit obtained with the isotropic exchange Hamilton described in
the text.

Figure 8 Temperature dependence of χMT for complex 2. The red solid line
corresponds to the
best fit obtained with the isotropic exchange Hamilton described in
the text.

The χMT product for complex 1 has a value of 1.17
cm3 K mol–1 at room temperature. This
is lower than the expected value of 1.50
cm3 K mol–1 for four uncoupled spins
with S1 = S2 = S3 = S4 = 1/2. As the temperature decreases, the χMT product gradually decreases, reaching to
a value of 0.02 cm3 K mol–1 at 40 K,
which remains nearly constant upon further cooling. This behavior
indicates the antiferromagnetic interactions among the copper centers.
Two different coupling constants have been taken into account to model
this susceptibility data (Scheme 3). Whereas J1 describes
the interaction mediated via the alkoxide and phosphate bridges, J2 refers to the interaction mediated via only
the phosphate bridge. The magnetic data were fitted satisfactorily
by applying the isotropic exchange Hamilton operator Ĥ = −2Jij∑ijŜiŜj. The
best simulation was obtained with J1 =
−96.0 and J2 = −26.6 cm–1 and gCu = 2.20(fix).
The g-value was maintained fixed to avoid overparameterization,
while a very small paramagnetic impurity of 6% with S = 1/2 was included during the simulation.

Scheme 3 Representation of
the Pathways Showing Magnetic Interactions in Complexes 1 and 2
For complex 2, the χMT product has a value of 1.09 cm3 K mol–1 at room temperature, which is lower than the expected value of 1.50
cm3 K mol–1 for the four uncoupled spins
with S1 = S2 = S3 = S4 = 1/2. On lowering the temperature to 40 K,
a gradual decrease in the χMT value
was documented, reaching to a value of 0.01 cm3 K mol–1, which remains nearly constant on further cooling.
This behavior is indicative of antiferromagnetic interactions among
the copper centers. Likewise, in complex 1, two different
coupling constants have been taken into account to model the susceptibility
data (Scheme 3). The
interaction that occurred through alkoxide and arsenate bridges is
defined as J1, and the interaction that
occurred through only arsenate bridge is defined as J2. A best fit of the magnetic data was achieved by applying
the isotropic exchange Hamilton operator: Ĥ = −2Jij∑ijŜiŜj. The
best simulation was accomplished with J1 = −101.8, J2 = −18.4 cm–1, and gCu = 2.089. The
magnetic results obtained for complex 2 are in very good
agreement with those for complex 1.

Magnetostructural
correlations between the Cu—O—Cu
and Cu—O—X—O—Cu (X = P (1) and As (2)) exchange pathways and the coupling constant
(J) have been established in μ-alkoxide- and
μ-phosphate/arsenate-bridged dicopper and multicopper complexes
showing antiferromagnetic interactions.9,33,40,63−66 Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit Cu—Obridging alkoxide—Cu angles of 131.87 and 135.29°,
respectively, which are greater than 130°; hence, antiferromagnetic
interactions having J values between −61.5
and −103.5 cm–1 would be expected.67−72 Furthermore, it deserves to be noted that magnetic coupling through
the Cu—O—X—O—Cu (X = P (1) and As (2)) exchange pathways connecting the equatorial
positions is weakly antiferromagnetic.15 Therefore, J1 accounts for the higher
values of −96.0 and −101.8 cm–1 for
complexes 1 and 2, respectively, containing
bis(μ-alkoxide)(μ-phosphate) bridges between the two copper
centers. The larger antiferromagnetic interaction of J1 in complex 2 is in very good agreement
with the expected behavior via a larger Cu—Obridging alkoxide—Cu angle. On the other hand, J2 represents lower values of −26.6 and −18.4 cm–1 for complexes 1 and 2,
respectively, holding only a μ-phosphate/μ-arsenate bridge
between the two copper centers. The shorter P—O bonds (average
1.535 Å) in complex 1 compared with the As—O
bonds (average 1.686 Å) in complex 2 account for
a better overlap, resulting in a slightly higher value of J2.

Electrochemical Properties
The redox
behaviors of complexes 1 and 2 were studied
by cyclic voltammetry at room temperature
in dimethylformamide (DMF) solutions containing 0.1 M [n-Bu4N][PF6] as the supporting electrolyte,
with a glassy carbon electrode and platinum wire as the working and
auxiliary electrodes, respectively. The reduction potentials of 1 and 2 were measured for a part of the characterization
of the complexes and to compare their redox chemistry with those of
some of the other complexes reported in the literature. The cathodic
scan of the solutions of complexes 1 and 2 within the potential window of 600 to −1600 mV, at a scan
rate of 50 mV/s, showed electrochemical activity. The cyclic voltammograms
of 1.0 mM solutions of complexes 1 and 2 in DMF solutions are shown in Figure 9. Under similar experimental conditions, cyclic voltammetry
studies of the free ligand H3cpdp revealed no electrochemical
activity within the scanned potential window (Figure S23). Hence, the electrochemical waves observed in
the cyclic voltammagrams of the complexes can be characterized as
metal-based electron transfer processes. The electrochemical properties
of complexes 1 and 2 feature an irreversible
one-electron reduction and one quasireversible oxidation couple. The
irreversible reduction peak at −0.82 V is assigned to the [1]−/2– reduction couple (Figure 9a). Further scanning
toward more
a negative potential resulted in only the reduction of the solvent.
Upon reversing the scan toward a positive potential, a quasireversible
response at E1/2 = 0.467 V and ΔEp = 0.091 V was observed, and the response has
been assigned to the [1]0/– reduction
couple. The cyclic voltammogram of complex 2 (Figure 9b) shows similar
features to that of complex 1 but at different reduction
potential values. The irreversible reduction peak at −0.93
V and the quasireversible peaks at E1/2 = 0.467 V and ΔEp = 0.079 V are
assigned to the [2]−/2– and
[2]0/– redox couples, respectively.
The shift in the reduction potential values of the two similar complexes
is partly attributed to the difference in the ability of the μ4-bridging anions, PO43– and AsO43–, to influence the electrophilic nature
of the copper(II) centers. The obtained reduction potential values
of the complexes are comparable to that of other tetranuclear copper
complexes reported in the literature.73,74

Figure 9 Cyclic voltammograms
of complexes (a) 1 and (b) 2 in DMF solutions,
measured at a scan rate of 50 mV/s with
a glassy carbon working electrode and a 0.1 M [n-Bu4N][PF6] supporting electrolyte. All potentials
were measured at room temperature and scaled to NHE using Cp2Fe/Cp2Fe+ (the literature value of E1/2NHE = 0.40 V vs NHE in DMF)75 as an internal standard.

Thermal Properties
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA)
of the fully dried crystalline samples of the complexes were performed
over a temperature range of 30–900 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The TGA plots of complexes 1–3 are presented in Figures 10 and S24.

Figure 10 TGA profiles of complexes
(a) 1 and (b) 2 under a N2 gas
atmosphere, at a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1.

For complex 1, the first weight loss of ∼11.31%
(calcd: 11.47%) in the temperature range of 55–163 °C
corresponds to the removal of 11 lattice water molecules. The residual
amorphous complex is stable up to 210 °C. Then, complex 1 shows decomposition of metal-organic framework between 215
and 885 °C. In the case of complex 2, the first
weight loss of ∼12.68% (calcd: 12.73%) in the temperature range
of 57–128 °C corresponds to the loss of twelve and two-thirds
lattice water molecules. The remaining substance is stable up to 200
°C, and further weight loss is observed between 210 and 815 °C
due to the decomposition of the overall framework. Similarly, complex 3 shows a weight loss of ∼13.59% (calcd: 14.20%) in
the temperature range of 33–205 °C, which is attributed
to the loss of fourteen and a half water molecules. No further weight
loss was observed up to 275 °C, followed by decomposition of
metal-organic framework between 280 and 715 °C. Thermogravimetric
analysis of the complexes indicates that complexes 1 and 2 are stable only up to ∼200 °C, whereas complex 3 is stable up to ∼275 °C. However, upon drying
the crystal samples of the complexes in vacuum, 1 and 2 lose three and four water molecules of crystallization,
respectively. Therefore, the thermogravimetric results agree with
the compositions of 1, 2, and 3 being Na3[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-PO4)](OH)2·11H2O, K2[Cu4(cpdp)2(μ4-AsO4)](OH)·122/3H2O, and
Na(H3O)2[Zn4(cpdp)2(μ4-HPO4)]Cl3·121/2H2O, respectively, in the solid state, which is
further supported by elemental analysis.

Conclusions
Three
new PO43–/HPO42–- and AsO43–-bridged
tetranuclear complexes of copper(II) and zinc(II) with Cu4(μ4-PO4), Cu4(μ4-AsO4), and Zn4(μ4-HPO4) cores of the polydentate ligand H3cpdp have been
synthesized and fully characterized. All complexes show the μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination mode for the bridging of PO43–/HPO42– and
AsO43– ions to four metal centers. Among
the complexes, 1 and 2 are rare examples
of tetranuclear copper complexes showing the μ4:η1:η1:η1:η1 coordination mode of the PO43– and
AsO43– groups. The presence of the μ4-coordination mode of the PO43–/HPO42– or AsO43– ions in each complex appears to serve as a stabilizing factor for
the tetranuclear Cu4 and Zn4 cores. Low-temperature
magnetic studies of 1 and 2 reveal that
μ-alkoxide of cpdp3– and the bridging PO43– or AsO43– ions act as moderate mediators of antiferromagnetic interactions
among the copper centers. The TGA studies suggest that the decomposition
temperature of the complexes range between 200 and 275 °C. Electrochemical
studies of complexes 1 and 2 in DMF solution
show the presence of fairly assessable metal-based irreversible one-electron
reduction and one quasireversible oxidation couple. Isolation of these
new tetranuclear assemblies showing the bridging potentials of phosphate
and arsenate will certainly offer valuable insights into and directions
toward the preparation of a variety of multinuclear transition metal
complexes with fascinating topologies in the future.

Experimental
Section
General Materials and Instrumentation
All reagents
and chemicals were purchased commercially from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie
GmbH, Germany, and Merck, India. These were reagent-grade materials
and used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H, N)
were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHNS/O Series II elemental
analyzer. Quantitative analyses of the copper and zinc contents in
the complexes were performed by iodometric titration (using Na2S2O3) and complexometric titration (using
Na2H2EDTA), respectively, in aqueous solution.
Potentiometric titration of the ligand was carried out using a Mettler
Toledo Seven Compact S220 digital ion/pH meter in aqueous solution.
FT-IR spectra of the solid samples were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer
L120-000A spectrometer. UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu
UV 1800 (200–900 nm) (1 cm quartz cell) spectrophotometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker
AC 400 NMR spectrometer. Mass spectra of the ligand were recorded
using a Micromass Q-Tof Micro (Waters) mass spectrometer. TGA was
carried out on powdered samples with a NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal analyzer.
Electrochemical measurements were made on a BAS-CV50 electroanalyzer,
controlled with a Pentium III computer, with three-electrodes: a glassy
carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a
Vycor-tipped Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The working
electrode was polished to a mirror finish on a microcloth of diamond
or alumina (1.0 and 0.05 mm particles, respectively) and was cleaned
electrochemically. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at a 1.0 mM
analyte concentration in DMF, using [n-Bu4N][PF6] as the supporting electrolyte. Data were analyzed
using the software provided with this instrument. The solutions were
degassed by purging with N2 gas for 10 min, and a blanket
of N2 was maintained over the solution while making the
measurements. iR compensation between the working
and reference electrodes was accomplished by applying the positive
feedback from the BAS-CV50 current follower. All potentials were measured
at room temperature and scaled to NHE using Cp2Fe/Cp2Fe+ (literature value of E1/2NHE = 0.40 V vs NHE in DMF)75 as an internal standard. Magnetic susceptibility data of
complexes 1 and 2 were collected on powdered
microcrystalline samples with a SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-7; Quantum
Design) in the temperature range of 2–300 K under an applied
field of 1 T. Experimental susceptibility data were corrected for
the underlying diamagnetism using Pascal’s constant.76 The temperature-dependent magnetic contribution
of the holder was determined experimentally and subtracted from the
measured susceptibility data. The program phi77 was used for spin Hamiltonian simulations of the data.

A solution of CuCl2·2H2O (0.157
g, 0.92 mmol) in methanol (10 mL) was
added to a solution of H3cpdp (0.511 g, 0.46 mmol) and
NaOH (0.055 g, 1.38 mmol) in methanol (10 mL). The reaction mixture
was stirred for 1 h, resulting in a light green solution. Then, an
aqueous solution (5 mL) of Na2HPO4·2H2O (0.041 g, 0.23 mmol) was added to this solution and the
stirring was maintained for another 1 h. Upon complete stirring, the
solution became blue. To remove any insoluble precipitate, the solution
was filtered. The clear filtrate was left to evaporate at ambient
temperature. Deep blue, block-shaped single crystals suitable for
X-ray diffraction were obtained after 7–10 days. Yield: 0.350

mL) solution of H3cpdp (0.511 g, 0.46
mmol) and NaOH (0.055 g, 1.38 mmol) was slowly added anhydrous ZnCl2 (0.125 g, 0.92 mmol) in methanol (10 mL) over a period of
10 min at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was refluxed for
1 h, resulting in a light yellow solution. Then, an aqueous solution
(5 mL) of Na2HPO4·2H2O (0.041
g, 0.23 mmol) was added to this solution and the reflux was continued
for another 1 h. After completion of the reaction, the light yellow
solution was cooled and filtered. Slow evaporation of the clear filtrate
at room temperature produced light yellow block-shaped single crystals
suitable for X-ray diffraction after 5–7 days. Yield: 0.338
g (79%). Anal. Calcd. for C62H90N8O28.5Cl3PNaZn4{Na(H3O)2[Zn4(cpdp)2(μ4-HPO4)]Cl3·121/2H2O}: C, 40.80; H, 4.97; N, 6.14; Zn, 14.33. Found: C, 40.69; H, 4.88;

Precaution
Regarding
the handling of the arsenic-containing
salt and its corresponding copper complex, standard protocols and
practices have been followed, as per the standard method prescribed
by the American Public Health Association, 2005.

X-ray Crystal
Structure Determination and Refinement
Single crystals of 1 and 2 were mounted
onto a diffractometer with a SuperNova, Dual, Cu at zero, Eos area
detector using graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å), and the data were collected at 100 K. Similarly,
crystal data for 3 were collected on a diffractometer
with a SuperNova, Dual, Cu at zero, Eos area detector using graphite
monochromated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The
orthorhombic space group of Pbcn for 1, orthorhombic space group of Pbcn for 2, and monoclinic space group of I2/a for 3 were determined by statistical tests. A total
of 8197 data, with Miller indices hmin = −25, hmax = 28, kmin =
−6, kmax = 14, lmin = −40, lmax = 16,
in the range of 1.604 < θ < 28.161° for 1; 7610 data, with Miller indices hmin = −27, hmax = 29, kmin = −12, kmax = 11, lmin = −38, lmax = 25, in the range of 1.738 < θ < 26.371° for 2; and 13 918 data, with Miller indices hmin = −38, hmax = 38, kmin = −14, kmax = 15, lmin = −35, lmax = 46, in the range of 3.518 < θ < 66.625°
for 3 were measured using ω oscillation frames.
Absorption correction of the data was done by the multiscan method.78 Direct methods were employed to solve the structures
with the help of SIR-9779 software, and
the refinement was completed by full-matrix least-squares methods
on F2 using the programs SHELXL80,81 and Olex2.82 A part of the structure
of 3 is disordered over two positions, with a ratio of
0.75:0.25. Whereas the zinc ions and phosphate group were modeled
over two positions, the cpdp3– ligand was not. In
all three structures, some of the solvent water molecules/counterions
are highly disordered over two or even three positions, which affects
the quality of the single-crystal X-ray data and refining model. The
difference Fourier map was used to locate the hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen
atoms of the complexes were included in idealized positions (C—H,
0.96 Å) and refined as riding models. Hydrogen atoms of the solvent
water molecules cannot be located precisely and were omitted.
