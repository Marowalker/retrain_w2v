Nonenzymatic glycation of lipids plays an important role
in several physiological and pathological processes, such as normal
aging and complications of diabetes mellitus. To develop liquid chromatography
coupled with mass spectrometric (LC-MS) methods for accurate analysis
of Amadori compound-glycated lipids from biological samples, it is
essential to obtain isotope-labeled Amadori-lipid standards. Herein,
we report optimized methods for the preparation of six stable isotope-labeled
Amadori-glycated lipid standards covering four types of lipids, including
[13C6]Amadori-phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE),
-phosphatidyl serine (PS), -LysoPE, and -LysoPS. Optimal conditions
for the synthesis and purification of these four types of Amadori-glycated
lipids were detailed in this study. LC-MS and LC-UV analyses showed
that destination products were highly purified (>95%). Accurate
mass and MS/MS fragmentation in both positive- and negative-ion modes
further validated the identification of these six synthetic [13C6]Amadori-glycated lipid standards. Successful
preparation of these highly purified isotope-labeled standards makes
it possible to develop targeted LC-MS/MS methods for accurate analysis
of Amadori-glycated phospholipids from biological samples.

1 Introduction
Nonenzymatic glycation, generally known as the Maillard reaction,
is triggered by reaction of amino group in biomolecules and carbonyl
function of reducing sugars (glucose, fructose, ribose, etc.) to form
an unstable Schiff base, followed by the Amadori rearrangement reaction
to form a more stable Amadori product.1 Furthermore, Amadori compounds can undergo complex reactions to
form advanced glycation end products (AGEs).1 The Amadori-modified compounds and AGEs are implicated in the pathogenesis
of age-related diseases and complications of mellitus.1−4

The Maillard reaction of proteins and peptides has attracted the
most attention in glycation and advanced glycation studies.1 However, aminophospholipids are also important
targets of nonenzymatic glycation.3 For
example, the nonenzymatic glycation of membrane lipids can cause peroxidation
of proteins and membrane lipids, inactivation of receptors, and other
membrane dysfunctions, which are involved in various physiological
and pathological processes, such as aging, diabetes, atherogenesis.4−10In vitro, Amadori products were reported with the
ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which can further lead
to lipid peroxidation involved in many physiological and pathological
processes.11

To better understand
the roles of Amadori-glycated lipids in physiological and pathological
processes, it is essential to develop analytical methods for a comprehensive
profiling of Amadori-glycated lipid species in biological samples.
To date, reported methods using liquid chromatography coupled with
mass spectrometric (LC-MS) technique have focused on Amadori-phosphatidyl
ethanolamine (PE) with a few identified molecular species.12−14 For lipidomic level investigation
on Amadori-glycated lipids, LC-MS/MS methods with high sensitivity
should be developed for measuring various types of Amadori lipids.
To this end, it is necessary to obtain stable isotope-labeled Amadori-glycated
lipid standards with high purity.

Several preparation methods
for Amadori-PE were already reported. However, these methods are not
well suited for preparing stable-isotope-labeled standards, in that
either a complex process of six steps is used15,16 or
synthesis is carried out in methanol (MeOH) phosphate buffer (PB)
medium, which requires a long reaction time (15 days) and a high amount
of glucose (500 mM),11,17 the latter is prohibitive for
isotope-labeled Amadori compound synthesis due to the high cost of
[13C6]glucose. A revised method using MeOH medium
was also reported for the synthesis of Amadori-PE,17−19 which requires a shorter reaction time (12
h) and less amount of glucose (100 mM). In spite of the methods mentioned
above, no data are available about how yields change under various
conditions, such as temperature, reaction duration, the ratio of reactants,
and reaction medium. Considering the high cost of [13C6]glucose, optimal conditions are required for the preparation
of [13C6]Amadori-PE standards. In addition,
to our knowledge, preparation of Amadori-phosphatidyl serine (PS),
-LysoPE, and -LysoPS has not been reported yet. Herein, we present
optimized methods for the preparation of [13C6]Amadori-PE, -PS, -LysoPE, and -LysoPS with high purity. The identification
of these synthetic [13C6]Amadori-lipid standards
was performed by LC-MS/MS analysis in both positive- and negative-ion
modes, and distinctive ions were identified for [13C6]Amadori-modified lipids.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemical and Solvent
1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE(16:0/18:1(9Z))), 1,2-dipentadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE(15:0/15:0)), 1-tridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (LysoPE(13:0)), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS(16:0/18:1(9Z))),
1,2-diheptadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS(17:0/17:0)), and 1-tridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (LysoPS(13:0)) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids
(Alabaster, AL). [U-13C6]-d-glucose
(99%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury,
MA). Butylated hydroxytoluene 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol (BHT) and all solvents, including MeOH, acetonitrile
(ACN), isopropanol (IPA), chloroform (CHCl3), and water
(H2O), of LC-MS grade and high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) grade were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).

2.2 Optimization of Synthetic
Conditions
On the basis of the work of Miyazawa and co-workers,11,17,18 we carried out a series of incubations
to optimize conditions for the synthesis of [13C6]Amadori-glycated lipids.

To find which medium (MeOH or MeOH-PB)
is better for the synthesis of [13C6]Amadori-lipids
and whether BHT could increase the reaction yield, three incubations
were performed as follows: (A) 7 μmol PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) was
mixed with 537 μmol [13C6]d-glucose
in 5 mL of MeOH-0.1 M PB (1:2, v/v, pH 8) at 37 °C; (B) 7 μmol
PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) was mixed with 107 μmol [13C6]d-glucose in 1 mL of MeOH at 37 °C with and
without 0.3 mg of BHT.

To further optimize the reaction temperature
and time, 7 μmol PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) was mixed with 107 μmol
[13C6]d-glucose in 1 mL of MeOH and
the mixture was stirred at 600 rpm in a Thermomix mixer (Eppendorf,
Germany) at 37, 50, or 60 °C. At different time intervals (0–4
days), aliquots of reaction mixtures were collected for analysis.
Incubations of [13C6]d-glucose with
LysoPE(13:0), PS(16:0/18:1(9Z)), and LysoPS(13:0) were carried out
similarly.

Optimization of reactant ratio was performed as follows:
7 μmol PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) was incubated in 1 mL of MeOH at 60
°C with 54, 107, 161 and 215 μmol of [13C6]d-glucose.

2.3 Purification of Amadori-Glycated Lipids
2.3.1 Lipid Extraction
For [13C6]Amadori-PE/PS species, the Folch method was performed
to remove [13C6]glucose and other water-soluble
byproducts. After incubation, the reaction mixture in 1 mL of MeOH
was mixed with 2 mL of CHCl3 and 0.6 mL of H2O. The mixture was vortexed for 20 s and then centrifuged at 3000
rpm for 15 min. The bottom layer was transferred out by a glass pipette
and then dried with nitrogen.

2.3.2 C18 Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE)
Because
of the high hydrophilicity of [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE/LysoPS
species, the Folch method cannot be used for liquid–liquid
extraction. Instead, C18 SPE was employed to separate synthetic
products from [13C6]glucose or other water-soluble
materials. In brief, incubation mixture was reconstituted in 10% MeOH
and then loaded onto an ISOLUTE C18 cartridge (500 mg,
Biotage, Sweden) conditioned with the same solvent. After rinsing
with an additional 5 mL of 10% MeOH, Amadori lipids were eluted out
with 10 mL of MeOH.

2.3.3 Phenylboronic Acid (PBA) SPE
Diol-containing Amadori-glycated
lipids can bind to immobilized PBA, which enables isolation of Amadori-glycated
lipids from their corresponding lipids. Bond Elut PBA cartridges (500
mg) purchased from Agilent (Palo Alto, CA) were adopted to perform
SPE for cleanup. Briefly, PBA cartridges were wetted with 5 mL of
MeOH and then conditioned with 3 mL of 150 mM ammonium formate (AF,
pH 10), followed by 5 mL of 20% MeOH containing 100 mM AF (pH 8) (loading
solvent). The dried resultant lipid extracts were redissolved in MeOH
and diluted 10 times with loading solvent before loading onto equilibrated
PBA cartridges. The cartridges were rinsed with 5 mL of MeOH containing
0.1% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide, then [13C6]Amadori-lipids
were recovered by elution with 5 mL of 90% MeOH containing 1% formic
acid. The elution effluent was nitrogen-dried and subjected to the
following HPLC separation.

2.3.4 HPLC-UV Separation
Semipreparative separation was performed
on a Shimadzu 20A HPLC equipped with LC-8A pumps. The samples were
loaded onto a Kromasil C18 column (250 × 10 mm, 10
μm, AkzoNobel, Bohus, Sweden) using four isocratic mobile phases
at a flow rate of 3 mL/min for different [13C6]Amadori-lipid species: [13C6]Amadori-PE: 100%
MeOH containing 5 mM AF; [13C6]Amadori-PS: 100%
MeOH containing 5 mM AF and 0.1% phosphoric acid; [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE: 80% MeOH containing 5 mM AF; and [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS: 75% MeOH containing 5 mM AF and 0.1%
phosphoric acid. The effluent was monitored for UV absorbance at 220
nm, and the injection volume was set at 500 μL.

2.4 LC-MS Analysis of [13C6]Amadori-Lipids
A Vanquish UHPLC system coupled
to a TSQ Quantiva triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was primarily used for the analysis of [13C6]Amadori-lipids. A core–shell Accucore C30 column (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) was used with a column oven temperature of 40 °C
and a flow rate of 350 μL/min. Two elution gradients were employed
for the analysis of [13C6]Amadori-PE/PS and
[13C6]Amadori-LysoPE/LysoPS, respectively, as
follows:

Gradient 1: Identical to the method previously published
by our laboratory for global lipidomics analysis,20 the mobile phase was composed of solvent A (ACN/H2O, 60:40, v/v) and solvent B (IPA/ACN, 90:10, v/v), both containing
10 mM AF and 0.1% formic acid. The gradient was as follows: −3
to 0 min, 30% B for column equilibration; 0–5 min, 30–43%
B; 5–5.1 min, 43–50% B; 5.1–14 min, 50–70%
B; 14.1–21 min, 70–99% B; 21–24 min, 99% B; 24–24.1
min, 99–30% B; 24.1–28 min, 30% B for column reequilibration.
The total analysis time including column reequilibration was 31 min.

Gradient 2: The mobile phase was composed of solvent A (H2O) and solvent B (MeOH), both containing 5 mM AF and 0.1% formic
acid. The gradient was as follows: −3 to 0 min, isocratic elution
with 60% B for the equilibration of the column; 0–3 min, 60%
B; 3–13 min, 60–99% B; 13–15 min, 99% B; 15–15.1
min, 99–60% B; 15.1–19 min, 60% B for column reequilibration.
The total analysis time including column reequilibration was 22 min.

The TSQ Quantiva mass spectrometer was equipped with a heated electrospray
ionization source, with positive- and negative-ion spray voltages
set at 3500 and 3000 V, respectively. For both ionization modes, nitrogen
was used as the sheath, auxiliary, and sweep gases at flow rates of
20, 7, and 1 (arbitrary units), respectively. Vaporizer and ion-transfer
tube temperatures were 400 and 350 °C, respectively. For MS analysis
in full-scan mode, the scan range, scan rate, and resolution were m/z 200–1000, 1000 amu/s, and 0.7
(full width at half maximum), respectively. For MS/MS analysis in
product ion scan mode, the argon collision gas pressure was 1.5 mTorr.
The optimized collision energy was 20 eV for [13C6]Amadori-PE and 16 eV for [13C6]Amadori-PS/LysoPE/LysoPS
in positive-ion mode, whereas it is 27 eV for [13C6]Amadori-PE/PS and 22 eV for [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE/LysoPS
in negative-ion mode.

For high-resolution mass analysis, a Q
Exactive HF hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was coupled to a Vanquish UPLC, as described above for
TSQ Quantiva. Mass ranges for full-scan MS and mass resolution settings
were m/z 100–1000 and 120 000,
respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Optimization of Synthetic Conditions
To determine the relative
yield of [13C6]Amadori-glycated lipids, LC-MS
analysis in full-scan mode was performed to quantify [13C6]Amadori-lipids synthesized under different conditions.
An assumption was made that Amadori-glycated lipids have similar ionization
efficiency to their corresponding unmodified lipids, so chromatographic
peak areas were used to estimate the relative reaction yield.  Reactions of
PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) with [13C6]d-glucose
in MeOH-PB, MeOH, and MeOH with addition of BHT were carried out at
37 °C in parallel. After incubation for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days,
aliquots of reaction mixtures were dried and then subjected to Folch
extraction. CHCl3 layer was transferred out, dried, reconstituted
in MeOH, and then subjected to LC-MS analysis.

As shown in Figure 1, reaction yield
in complete MeOH medium was 3.2, 4.9, 5.8, and 7.0 times higher than
those in MeOH-PB after incubation for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days, respectively.
On the other hand, yields in MeOH were 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, and 1.4 times
higher than those in MeOH + BHT after 1, 2, 3, and 4 days, respectively.
BHT, a synthetic antioxidant that can effectively inhibit the browning
reaction and lipid peroxidation,17,21,22 was expected to prevent the formation of secondary
byproducts and thus increase the recovery of destination product;
however, our results showed that addition of BHT did not help the
production of [13C6]Amadori-PE.

Figure 1 Reaction yields of [13C6]Amadori-PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) in the medium of
MeOH-PB, MeOH, or MeOH in the presence of BHT.

In terms
of effects of reaction temperature and time, as shown in Figure 2, yields peaked at
60 °C and 3 days for [13C6]Amadori-PE,
50 °C and 3 days for [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE,
and 50 °C and 2 days for [13C6]Amadori-PS/LysoPS.

Figure 2 Effect of temperature
and time on reaction yields
of (A) [13C6]Amadori-PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)), (B)
[13C6]Amadori-PS(16:0/18:1(9Z)), (C) [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE(13:0/0:0), and (D) [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS(13:0/0:0).

To optimize the ratio of reactants, incubations of 7 μmol
PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) in 1 mL of MeOH at 60 °C with 54, 107, 161,
and 215 μmol [13C6]d-glucose
were carried out in parallel, with the corresponding molar ratios
of [13C6]glucose over PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)) being
7.7, 15.4, 23.1, and 30.9. After 3 days of incubation, the resulting
yields were 19.9, 40.6, 49.9, and 53.0% for the molar ratios of 7.7,
15.4, 23.1, and 30.9, respectively. This result showed that yields
increased with increasing molar ratio of [13C6]glucose over PE. However, the increase of yield was not significant
when the molar ratio increased from 23.1 to 30.9. As such, molar ratios
of [13C6]d-glucose over lipids were
optimized to about 23 for the synthesis of all Amadori-glycated lipids.
The optimized synthetic conditions for [13C6]Amadori-PE/PS/LysoPE/LysoPS are listed in Table 1.

3.2 Purification and Identification of [13C6]Amadori-Glycated Lipids
Purification methods differed between
[13C6]Amadori-PE/PS, [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE, and [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS because
of their different chemical properties. Figure 3 shows the flowchart for purification of
[13C6]Amadori-PE, -PS, -LysoPE, and -LysoPS,
as synthesized in Section 3.1.

Figure 3 Outline of protocols
for purification of [13C6]Amadori-lipids.

In terms of [13C6]Amadori-PE/PS
species, we first removed [13C6]d-glucose
from the incubation mixture by liquid–liquid extraction, for
which the Folch method was employed. Diol-containing glucose has the
ability to bind to immobilized PBA,23,24 which will
likely affect the binding between PBA and [13C6]Amadori-lipids. After lipid extraction, PBA SPE was performed to
separate [13C6]Amadori-PEs from their corresponding
substrates, according to the reversible covalent interaction between
PBA and diol-containing [13C6]Amadori-PEs. [13C6]Amadori-PEs were finally purified by semipreparative
HPLC. As for [13C6]Amadori-PS species, however,
PBA SPE was not applicable because [13C6]Amadori-PSs
could not be retained well on PBA SPE column. A similar poor retention
was also observed for [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS.
The possible reason is that [13C6]Amadori-PS/LysoPS
carries negative charge under alkaline conditions, which results in
electrostatic repulsion from immobilized boronate.25 In contrast to [13C6]Amadori-PE,
the separation performance of [13C6]Amadori-PS
on C18 column was improved largely by adding acid to mobile
phase. Consequently, [13C6]Amadori-PSs were
purified on a semipreparative C18 column using isocratic
elution with 100% MeOH containing 5 mM AF and 0.1% phosphoric acid,
then one more Folch extraction was employed to remove phosphoric acid
in eluent from purified compounds.

LC-MS full-scan chromatograms
(Figure 4) showed that
[13C6]Amadori-PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)), -PE(15:0/15:0),
-PS(16:0/18:1(9Z)), and -PS(17:0/17:0) were pure (>95%), with purification
process recoveries of about 43, 51, 31, and 25%, respectively. LC-UV
chromatograms (Supporting Information Figure S1) also validated the high purity of [13C6]Amadori-lipids.

purified (B) [13C6]Amadori-PE(16:0/18:1(9Z)),
(C) [13C6]Amadori-PE(15:0/15:0), (D) [13C6]Amadori-PS(16:0/18:1(9Z)), and (E) [13C6]Amadori-PS(17:0/17:0). The mass range for full-scan analysis
was m/z 200–1000. The peak
at 11.96 min appearing in all plots of this figure was from background.

Compared to [13C6]Amadori-PE/PS, [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE/LysoPS are more hydrophilic. Thus, different
strategies were employed for purification of [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE/LysoPS. Instead of the Folch method, C18 SPE was performed to remove [13C6]d-glucose for [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE. In terms
of [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS, besides its low recovery
on PBA SPE, we found it was more unstable than the other species.
To make the purification more efficient for [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS, direct purification using HPLC was employed, which
utilizes isocratic elution with 75% MeOH containing 5 mM AF and 0.1%
phosphoric acid. After HPLC preparation, phosphoric acid in the eluent
was removed by C18 SPE. [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS
was recovered in MeOH, nitrogen-dried, and kept at −80 °C.
LC-MS full-scan chromatograms (Figure 5) showed that [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE(13:0/0:0)/LysoPS(13:0/0:0)
were pure (>95%), with purification process recoveries of about
48 and 19%, respectively. LC-UV chromatograms (Supporting Information Figure S2) also validated their high purity.

of (A) blank control, and purified (B) [13C6]Amadori-LysoPE(13:0/0:0) and (C) [13C6]Amadori-LysoPS(13:0/0:0).
The mass range for full-scan analysis was m/z 200–1000.

The mass accuracy of the six purified [13C6]Amadori-lipids was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry.
A comparison between measured masses with calculated values exhibited
a high mass accuracy (mass errors ranged from −2.6 to 2.4 ppm)
(Supporting Information Table S1).

Isotopic purity of these six synthesized compounds was also investigated
using high-mass-resolution LC-MS. Extracted ion chromatograms were
generated and peak areas were integrated for each of the resolved
isotopes related to these compounds (Supporting Information Figure S3). After subtracting the contribution
from the non-fully labeled natural isotopes, peak area values of isotopes
were used to calculate the relative percent of isotopic enrichment
and the overall isotopic purity. As a result, these six synthesized
compounds were found to be 93.67–94.3% fully enriched (containing
six labeled carbons); and the overall isotopic purities ranged from
98.9 to 99.0%, showing that 98.9–99.0% of the potentially labeled
positions in these compounds were occupied by 13C. This
is in agreement with the 99% isotope purity of the starting material,
[13C6]d-glucose.

3.3 Characteristic MS/MS Fragmentations
of [13C6]Amadori-Lipids
To further
verify the authenticity of products synthesized, MS/MS fragmentation
in both positive- and negative-ionization modes was performed on a
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer under collision-induced dissociation.
First, Q1 mass spectrum confirmed the most abundant molecular ion
peaks as [M + H]+ ions in positive-ion mode and [M –
H]− ions in negative-ion mode (Supporting Information Figures S4 and S5). Next, product ion scanning
was performed to investigate their fragmentation characteristics.
In positive-ion mode, neutral losses of 309.1 Da (H2PO4C2H4NH13C6H11O5) and 353.1 Da (H2PO4C2H3COOHNH13C6H11O5) from [M + H]+ ion were observed for [13C6]Amadori-PE/LysoPE and [13C6]Amadori-PS/LysoPS, respectively, which were generated from the cleaved
polar head groups (Figure 6). It was notable that a neutral loss of 168.1 Da (isotope-labeled
Amadori moiety, 13C6H10O5)—a characteristic neutral loss in MS/MS fragmentation of
Amadori-peptides1,26—could also be observed
but with a much lower intensity (Figure 6, inset). Meanwhile, neutral losses of H2O, 2H2O, 3H2O, and 3H2O +
H13CHO could also be observed for all six synthetic [13C6]Amadori-lipids. In negative-ion mode, fragment
ions generated from the neutral loss of 168.1 Da became dominant for
[13C6]Amadori-PE/LysoPE species (Figure 7A,B,E), and could be clearly
observed (10–12% relative intensities) for [13C6]Amadori-PS/LysoPS (Figure 7C,D,F). The base peaks in the MS/MS negative spectra
of [13C6]Amadori-PS/LysoPS belong to fragment
ions generated from the neutral loss of 255.1 Da ([PA/LPA –
H]−). Furthermore, other characteristic ions related
to fatty acyl chains of synthetic compounds and fragment ions of
glycerophosphate groups could also be identified from the MS/MS negative
spectra in Figure 7. These characteristic ions are summarized in Table 2, which are consistent with the fragmentation
patterns of phospholipids previously reported.27,28 Representative
fragmentation schemes of these synthetic [13C6]Amadori-phospholipids are shown in Figure 8, taking [13C6]Amadori-PE(16:0/18:1(9Z))
and [13C6]Amadori-PS(16:0/18:1(9Z)) as examples.

Unlabeled analogues corresponding to these six [13C6]-labeled compounds were also synthesized and subjected to
LC-MS/MS analysis. Each unlabeled analogue had the same retention
time as its corresponding labeled compound under the same LC condition
(Supporting Information, Figure S6). From
their MS/MS spectra in positive-ion mode, expected neutral losses
of 303.1 Da (H2PO4C2H4NHC6H11O5) and 347.1 Da (H2PO4C2H3COOHNHC6H11O5) from [M + H]+ ion could be observed
for Amadori-PE/LysoPE and Amadori-PS/LysoPS, respectively (Supporting
Information Figure S7). From their MS/MS
spectra in negative-ion mode, the expected neutral loss of 162.1 Da
(Amadori moiety) could also be observed for all of these six unlabeled
compounds (Supporting Information Figure S8). Collectively, the expected fragmentation patterns and the corresponding
mass shifts observed for all synthetic [13C6]Amadori-lipids unambiguously validated the identification of these
novel compounds.

4 Conclusions
In this study, six stable isotope-labeled [13C6]Amadori-glycated lipids were synthesized, purified,
and structurally confirmed using accurate mass measurement and tandem
mass spectrometry, covering four types of lipids, including Amadori-PE,
-PS, -LysoPE, and -LysoPS. Optimal conditions for the synthesis and
purification of these four types of stable isotope-labeled Amadori-glycated
lipids were obtained. MS/MS fragmentation in both positive- and negative-ion
modes validated the identification of these novel synthetic compounds.
The high purity (>95%) of these synthetic compounds was verified
by both LC-MS full-scan analysis and LC-UV analysis. As a result,
successful preparation of highly purified stable isotope-labeled Amadori-lipid
standards makes it possible to develop targeted LC-MS/MS methods for
accurate analysis of endogenous Amadori-glycated phospholipids from
biological samples.
