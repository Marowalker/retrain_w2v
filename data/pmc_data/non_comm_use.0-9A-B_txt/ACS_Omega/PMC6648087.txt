The titania film
surface exhibits superhydrophilicity after UV
irradiation due to its photocatalytic function. This is caused by
a change in the density of the surface hydroxyl groups, which affects
the surface charge density. Titania films were prepared to observe
the change in the surface charge during UV irradiation. The amounts
of some xanthene dyes adsorbed and deposited on the titania films
after UV irradiation were evaluated as a function of the irradiation
time. The increase in the adsorption and deposition amounts of the
more negative dye versus the UV irradiation time was greater. These
results indicated that the titania surface charge became more positive
by the UV irradiation. It was reported that basic hydroxyl groups
formed on the titania particle surface during the UV irradiation.
The surface dissociates hydroxyl ions into the water phase and has
a positive charge, which was supported by the present study.

Introduction
Titania is one of the
active photocatalysts that is well known
and widely studied.1,2 The titania surface is reported
to exhibit superhydrophilicity after UV irradiation due to its photocatalytic
function. The hydrophilicity increased during UV irradiation. This
is caused by a change in the density of the surface hydroxyl groups,
which affects the surface charge density. The reported mechanism is
as follows.3,4

First, photoproduced holes are diffused
on the titania surface
and trapped by lattice oxygens during the photocatalytic process.
Second, the distance of the Ti–O bond increases and then the
Ti–OH interaction weakens. Third, a water molecule is coordinated
to Ti and new surface OH groups are formed. The density of the OH
groups on the titania surface increases. In addition to this, degradation
of organic molecules on the surface also increases its hydrophilicity.
However, the status of the titania surface is not easy to evaluate
because the surface is actually covered with many water molecules
and some impurities. It is important that the surface should be probed
by various approaches and insights.

Some dye molecules are used
for analyzing a solid surface and its
inside because their structures are sensitive to the surrounding properties,
such as acidity and polarity.5−11 Their UV–vis absorption spectra are convenient for probing
their structures. Xanthene dyes used for laser media are also used
as the in situ probe molecules for spectroscopic measurements.5,6,11 In our previous study, a small
amount of silica deposited on the titania surface was detected by
the adsorption of a fluorescein dye such that its absorption spectrum
indicated a higher acidity than that when adsorbed on the titania
surface.11 There are several xanthene dyes
possessing different charge or pKa values,
which are available to probe the titania surface.12−15 In this study, titania films
were prepared by a simple sol–gel method to observe changes
in the titania surface charge during UV irradiation. The dye molecules
were “adsorbed” and “deposited” on the
titania films from their aqueous solutions. The amounts of several
xanthene dyes adsorbed and deposited on the titania films after UV
irradiation were evaluated as a function of the irradiation time.
The UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained to estimate the
dye amounts and titania surface acidity. The amounts of the adsorbed
dyes were estimated by subtracting those of the dyes remaining in
the solutions from the initial amounts. The amounts of the deposited
dyes were those of the dyes loaded on the substrates after withdrawing
them from the solutions.

The xanthene dyes, erythrosin B (anionic,
pKa 2.35, 3.79), eosin Y (anionic, pKa 2.02, 3.80), fluorescein (anionic, pKa 2.08, 4.31, 6.43), rhodamine 6G (cationic),
and rhodamine B (cationic
or neutral) were used as probe molecules. Their molecular forms are
shown in Scheme 1.

Results and Discussion
The measurement
of the contact angle of a water droplet on a solid
surface is a general and simple method to evaluate the surface hydrophilicity
or hydrophobicity. Figure S1 shows the
change in the contact angle of a water droplet (0.50 mm3) on the titania film UV-irradiated as a function of time. The angle
decreased with an increase in the irradiation time from 40° to
less than 10°, indicating that the surface became more hydrophilic
by further irradiation. This is a well-known property of the titania
exhibiting superhydrophilicity.

The determination of the amount
of the adsorbed water is also a
method to evaluate the surface hydrophilicity. Figure S2 shows the Fourier transform infrared-reflection
absorption spectroscopy (FTIR-RAS) spectra of the adsorbed water on
the titania films UV-irradiated as a function of time and the relative
amount of the adsorbed water estimated from them. The amount was normalized
by that on the titania film before UV irradiation (0 h). The peaks
at around 3500–3000 and at 1640 cm–1 can
be assigned to the O–H stretching and vending vibrations of
the surface OH groups and adsorbed water molecules, respectively.16−19 The intensity of these bands clearly increased with an increase
in the irradiation time. This behavior also indicated an increase
in the amount of the adsorbed water due to an enhancement of the hydrophilicity
of the titania surface.

Figure S3 shows the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra for the O 1s electrons of the titania film
before and after the UV irradiation for 5 h. Both spectra consisted
of three bands assigned to the O–Ti bond of the titania, OH
group, and the adsorbed water.19−22 The peak observed at 529.8 eV was assigned to the
lattice oxygen of the titania crystal. The bands at around 532–533
eV can be assigned to the OH group and adsorbed water. Table S1 shows the relative amounts of the elements
(Ti, O, and C) and the components for the O 1s bands. The percentages
of the O–Ti bond and OH group increased by the 5 h irradiation.
The ratios of the OH group to the Ti were 0.73 and 0.78 before and
after the irradiation, respectively. The carbon atoms due to some
impurities also decreased. It is important that the amount of the
OH group clearly increased by the irradiation.

Figure 1 shows the
UV–vis absorption spectra of the dyes in their basic solutions
and those after reaching their adsorption equilibria on the titania
plates unirradiated and UV-irradiated for 5 h. The absorbance of all
of the dyes more significantly decreased due to the adsorption onto
the irradiated titania than the unirradiated one. Figure 2 shows the UV–vis absorption
spectra of the dyes deposited from their basic solutions on the titania
films UV-irradiated as a function of time. The absorbance of all
of the dyes generally increased with an increase in the irradiation
time in consideration of some experimental deviations. The absorbance
of erythrosin B slightly changed after the 1 h irradiation. The absorbance
of rhodamine B slightly changed during the 5 h irradiation. These
results indicated that the amounts of the dye molecules adsorbed and
deposited on the titania films increased due to an increase in the
hydrophilicity. Table 1 shows the absolute adsorption and deposition amounts of the dye
molecules before and after the 5 h UV irradiation. Figure 3 shows the changes (increments)
in the adsorption and deposition amounts of the dye molecules after
the 5 h UV irradiation. The amounts of the deposited dyes were significantly
higher than those of the adsorbed dyes. The relative adsorption and
deposition amounts were also calculated by normalizing the amount
of each dye adsorbed and deposited before the irradiation (0 h). The
pKa value for the anionic dye of the stronger
acid, i.e., erythrosin B, eosin Y, and fluorescein, is lower, indicating
that the dye possesses a more negative charge.12−15 The pKa values for the proton dissociation between the anion and dianion
for erythrosin B, eosin Y, and fluorescein are 3.79, 3.80, and 6.43,
respectively.13,14 The adsorption or deposition
of the neutral or cationic dye (rhodamine B) and cationic dye (rhodamine
6G) did not significantly increase. The relative increases in both
the adsorption and deposition amounts of the more negative dye more
significantly increased with the UV irradiation time.

Figure 4 shows the
dependence of the relative deposition amounts of the dyes onto the
titania films on the UV irradiation time compared to that of the relative
adsorption amount of water and the surface acidity estimated from
the dianion/anion ratio of fluorescein. The relative adsorption and
deposition amounts were calculated by normalizing the amounts of water
adsorbed and each dye deposited before the irradiation (0 h). The
acid–base equilibria of fluorescein are shown in Scheme 2. The rate of the increase
in the   deposition amounts of the more negative dyes was greater
than that of the water adsorption. The dye molecules are deposited
on the titania film surface during dip-coating, i.e., the competition
process between running down of the solution and water evaporation,
which increases and decreases the dye deposition amount, respectively.
Therefore, the deposition amount depends on not only the hydrophilicity
of the surface but also the electrostatic interaction between the
surface and dye molecules. The interaction is caused by the charges
on the titania surface and the dye molecules. Figure S4 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of rhodamine
6G and rhodamine B deposited from their acidic solutions on the titania
films UV-irradiated as a function of time. Figure S5 shows the dependence of their relative deposition amounts
onto the titania films on the UV irradiation time compared to that
of the relative adsorption amount of water. The amount of rhodamine
B deposited from its acidic solution was greater than that deposited
from the basic solution because rhodamine B easily formed hydrochloric
salt and precipitated during dip-coating under the acidic condition.
However, their deposition amounts did not significantly increase by
the UV irradiation as expected.

amounts of the dyes onto

relative adsorption amount of water and (b) the surface acidity estimated
from the dianion/anion ratio of fluorescein.

Scheme 2 Parts of Acid–Base Equilibria of Fluorescein
The acidity of the titania
particle surface is equivalent to around
pH 7 in water. Fluorescein exhibits the pKa of 6.43 for the proton dissociation between the anion and dianion.
The change in the acidity of the titania particle surface can be effectively
probed using fluorescein. Previously, the spectra of the fluorescein
adsorbed on the silica and titania indicated the acidity corresponding
to pH values about 5.8 and 6.1 in water, respectively, estimated from
the ratio of the dianion species to the anion species.11 In this study, consequently, the pH value increased
with an increase in the UV irradiation time from ca. 6.46 to ca. 6.53,
indicating that the surface became more basic. The titania surface
charge became more positive by the UV irradiation. It is presumed
that the concentration of basic OH groups increased on the titania
surface, originally having the acidic and basic OH groups, during
the UV irradiation based on the reported mechanism.3,4 This
phenomenon was utilized for the reaction of surface modification with
silica, zinc oxide, etc.11,23−25 The concentration of the active species and basicity slowly increased
at limited sites because its efficiency is not very high during the
photocatalytic reaction on the titania. This property is suitable
to control the reaction forming very small particles or thin layers.
The present results supported the fact that the titania surface dissociates
hydroxyl ions into the water phase and has a positive charge.

Conclusions
In this study, the amounts of several xanthene dyes adsorbed and
deposited on the titania films after the UV irradiation were
evaluated as a function of the irradiation time. The UV–vis
absorption spectra were observed to evaluate the dye amounts and titania
surface acidity. The increase in the adsorption and deposition amounts
of the more negative dye versus the UV irradiation time was greater.
These results indicated that the titania surface charge became more
positive by the UV irradiation because the surface dissociated hydroxyl
ions into the water phase.

Experimental Section
Titanium tetraisopropoxide,
ethanol, acetone, nitric acid, hydrochloric
acid, and sodium hydroxide (Wako, S or Reagent Grade) were used without
further purification. Water was ion-exchanged and distilled using
a distiller (Yamato WG23). The glass plates (Matsunami S-1111) were
individually washed with a detergent and acetone, soaked in 0.10 mol
dm–3 hydrochloric acid for 2 h, and washed with
ethanol. The xanthene dyes, erythrosin B, eosin Y, fluorescein, rhodamine
6G, and rhodamine B (Wako, S grade) were used as probe molecules without
further purification.

The glass substrates (76 mm × 26
mm) were coated with a thin
titania film by the sol–gel method. The titania sol was prepared
by mixing 37.5 cm3 of ethanol, 0.32 cm3 of nitric
acid, and 0.30 cm3 of water and then adding 7.50 cm3 of titanium tetraisopropoxide under a dry nitrogen atmosphere.
The anatase-type titania films were prepared by 10 dip-coatings using
the sol and then heating at 773 K for 30 min. The thickness of the
10-layered film was ca. 300 nm, as previously reported.11

The UV–vis absorption spectra were
measured using a spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu UV-3150). The FTIR-RAS for the film samples was conducted
using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu IRPrestige-21) with an RAS
accessory. The XPS was conducted by Al Kα radiation using an
X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometer (VG Scientific ESCALAB 250).

The titania films were irradiated with UV light for 0–5
h. Pure water, 1.0 cm3, was spread on the titania plates
and dried at 293 K and a relative humidity of 40% for 1 h to evaluate
the hydrophilicity of the titania surface. The relative amount of
the adsorbed water was estimated by measuring the FTIR-RAS spectra
of the titania films. The UV irradiation was conducted using a black
lamp (500 μW cm–2).

The dye molecules
were adsorbed and deposited on the titania films
from their aqueous solutions, in which the pH values were adjusted
to around 8.0 by adding sodium hydroxide. However, rhodamine 6G was
insoluble under this condition. Rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B were
also dissolved in water, in which the pH values were around 3.0. The
titania films were irradiated with UV light for 1–5 h. The
titania plates were immersed in a 1.0 × 10–2 mol dm–3 aqueous solution of each dye for 80 min.
The amounts of the adsorbed dyes were estimated by measuring the UV–vis
absorption spectra of the dyes remaining in the solutions. The titania
plates adsorbing the dyes were withdrawn from the solutions and then
dried at 293 K and a relative humidity of 40% for 1 h. The amounts
of the deposited dyes were estimated by measuring the UV–vis
absorption spectra (absorbance areas) of the withdrawn titania plates
based on analytical curves obtained using the absorbance areas of
known amounts of the deposited dyes shown in Figure S6.
