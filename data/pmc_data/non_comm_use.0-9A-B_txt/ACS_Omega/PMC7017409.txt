A concise
and high-yielding double aza-Michael
reaction is presented as an atom-efficient method to access chiral
2-substituted 4-piperidone building blocks from divinyl ketones. The
piperidones were further converted into analogues of donepezil, an
acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drug used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease. The donepezil analogues were obtained as inseparable diastereomeric
mixtures with resolved stereochemistry in position 2 of the piperidine
ring. Biological evaluation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibition
by these analogues provides a new insight into structure–activity
relationship studies with regard to donepezil’s piperidine
moiety toward stereochemical enhancement.

==== Body
Introduction
The piperidine ring
is an important scaffold in pharmaceutical
research and a ubiquitous structural motif which is present in several
natural products.1,2 In general, the 1,4-disubstitution
pattern on the piperidine ring prevails among drug prototypes due
to more accessible synthetic routes and limited stereochemical complications.
Nonetheless, it has been shown that additional substitution on different
positions of piperidine could show highly beneficial in terms of identifying
compounds with increased biological activity.3,4 The
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibiting drug donepezil 1 (Figure 1) contains
such a 1,4-disubstituted piperidine core.

Figure 1 Donepezil.

Donepezil is the most commonly prescribed medication for
Alzheimer’s
diseases (Aricept).5−7 There is a growing interest in the field for the
development of analogues to allow for various therapeutic approaches,
such as dual- or multifunctional targeting and AChE reactivation.5−10 In this context, medicinal chemistry research efforts have been
mainly centered on ligand-based and fragment-based drug design methodologies
to generate “fully” organic compounds,5−8 as well as chelators for metals9 and
organometallic complexes,10 as donepezil-derived
hits for medical applications. The X-ray resolved structure of AChE
has also permitted structure-based drug design approaches.11,12 Although these latter studies are reported in a limited number,
they have established a structural baseline for efficient AChE inhibitor
design.10

In the search for a novel
class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors,
studies conducted by the Japanese company Eisai Co., Ltd. demonstrate
that the presence of a piperidine ring into the donepezil structure
is essential for increased AChE inhibitory effects.13,14 Despite piperidine’s crucial role in the overall activity
of donepezil and the various structure–activity relationship
studies reported for this lead compound,15−20 to the best of our knowledge, no other modifications on the piperidine
ring have been reported in the literature, with the exception of substitutions
in positions 1 and 4. Moreover, analysis of the crystal structure
of donepezil bound to acetylcholinesterase suggests that additional
substituents on the piperidine ring could be accommodated in the binding
pocket, thereby leading to an improved pharmacological profile of
derived analogue drugs.18,21

In this context,
we have used divinyl ketones to set up an efficient aza-Michael synthesis for the preparation of 4-piperidone
scaffolds, which are substituted in position 2 of the ring. We have
then used the resulting 4-piperidones to develop a new series of donepezil-based
derivatives, to biologically evaluate the impact of chiral modification
on the piperidine moiety with regard to their acetylcholinesterase
inhibition.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
Our approach toward the
synthesis of donepezil
analogues 4 (Scheme 1) involves the use of chirally resolved 2-substituted
1-S-α-phenylethyl-4-piperidones 2 that are further converted into aldehyde intermediates 3.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Approach for 2-Substituted Donepezil Analogues
Synthesis of 2-Substituted 1-S-α-Phenylethyl-4-piperidones
The first step toward
the synthesis of divinyl ketones 7 was the reaction of
suitable vinyl aldehydes 5 with
vinylmagnesium bromide under standard Grignard conditions (Scheme 2). Dienols 6a–e were obtained in high yield (Table 1) and sufficiently
pure to be used in the next synthetic step without further purification.
Also, no degradation was observed for 6a–e, if stored at 4 °C for several weeks (as confirmed
by 1H NMR analysis). The desired divinyl ketones 7 (Scheme 2 and Table 1), substituted
with aliphatic or aromatic groups, were obtained through the following
oxidation reaction under mild conditions of intermediates 6, using manganese(IV) oxide (for 6a,b)
or 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) (for 6c–e) (Scheme 2). The oxidizing agent was selected according to the
reactivity of the substrate and the stability of the product. In this
regard, the conversion of methyl- and propyl-substituted 6a,b to ketones 7a,b was straightforwardly
achieved using MnO2. In contrast, MnO2-mediated
conditions were found not to be suitable to convert the aromatic analogues 6c–e, which were preferentially oxidized
using DDQ. Due to the higher stability of ketones 7c–e, column chromatography was successfully performed in this
case, allowing the removal of the oxidizing agent and the complete
purification of the products, which were obtained in a good to moderate
yield (Table 1).

A double aza-Michael addition of
primary amines
(i.e., benzylamine or S-α-phenylethylamine)
was carried out on ketones 7 as an atom-efficient method
to access chiral 4-piperidine-based building blocks 8, 2, and 2′ (Scheme 2). Initial investigations on the appropriate
solvent for the double aza-Michael addition were
performed with benzylamine and phenyl-substituted ketone 7c. Since neat acetonitrile or dichloromethane proved unsuccessful
in these test reactions, we applied a slightly modified procedure
in comparison to methods previously reported in the literature.22−24 Specifically, divinyl ketone 7c was slowly added to
a mixture of benzylamine in acetonitrile and aqueous sodium bicarbonate
at 16 °C over a period of 40 min and then refluxed for 1.5 h
(entry 3, Table 2).
The 2-phenyl-substituted piperidine 8c was obtained with
79% yield. With these reaction conditions, a range of aliphatically
and aromatically substituted piperidones have been prepared (Table 2, 8a–e). As expected, the yields for the methyl- and propyl-substituted
piperidones 8a,b (Table 2, entries 1 and 2) were lower due to the
less stable nature of the crude starting ketones 7a,b. In contrast, when purified aromatic divinyl ketones 7c–e were used for the cyclization with
benzylamine (Table 2, entries 3–5), piperidones 8c–e were obtained in high yield (79–84%). S-α-Phenylethylamine
was chosen as a chiral auxiliary to synthesize diastereomeric 2-substituted-4-piperidones.25,26 In line with the analogue series 8a–e, the combined yields for the aliphatically substituted piperidones 2a + 2′a (R = methyl) and 2b + 2′b (R = propyl) were lower (Table 2, entries 1 and 2), while aromatically
substituted piperidones 2c + 2′c (entry
3–5) were differently obtained in good, albeit with lower combined
yields in comparison to the cyclization using benzylamine. Subsequently,
the correct stereochemistry of new compounds 2b–e + 2′b–e was assigned
by adopting a similar analysis as conducted by Leshcheva et al. (see Section S2 in the Supporting Information).27

Synthesis of Donepezil Analogues
By modifying the reported
synthesis of donepezil,28 diastereomeric
methyl- and phenyl-substituted 4-piperidones building blocks 2a + c and 2′a + c were subjected to a Wittig reaction using [(Ph3)PCH2OCH3]Cl and lithium diisopropylamide (LDA),29 to generate the corresponding methoxymethylene
derivatives 9a–d + 9′a–d in good to high yields (Table 3). The chromatographic separation of the
two isomers of all substrates allowed the unambiguous determination
of their correct stereochemistry due to distinct nuclear Overhauser
effect (NOE) correlations found in the isolated products (see Section S1 in the Supporting Information).

Sugimoto’s conditions for the originally reported
acidic
hydrolysis of the methoxymethylene intermediate (in donepezil) lead
only to a moderate yield (i.e., 54%),28 due to the need of not trivial column chromatography for the purification
of the product. Therefore, we set up a different protocol based on
the mild hydrolysis of enol ethers 9 + 9′a–d with a mixture of tetrahydrofuran/1.6 M HCl
(1:1)29 (Table 4). The corresponding aldehydes 3 + 3′a–d were obtained as
diastereomeric mixtures in excellent yields and high purity. Nonetheless,
it was observed (by 1H NMR analysis) that the storage of
aldehydes at low temperatures (i.e., −20 °C) is necessary
to prevent degradation over time. The diastereomeric ratio was determined
by analysis of the 1H NMR spectra (Table 4), and the chirality of the 4-formyl moiety
was confidently assigned for all products from the observed nuclear
Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) correlations (see Section S1 in the Supporting Information).

As an example, in Figure 2 are reported the correlations observed between
Hax-2 and the proton in position 4 of aldehyde 3b (see Section S1 in the Supporting Information).
This
indicates an axial position for H-4 and, hence, R-chirality for the stereocenter in position 4. In contrast, no such
NOESY correlation between Hax-2 and the proton in position
4 was found in diastereomer 3′b, while the interaction
was observed between the protons of the methyl group in position 2
and Heq-4, which confirms S-chirality
for this stereocenter in position 4 of the piperidine ring.

correlations in diastereomeric aldehydes 3b and 3′b.

With regard to the overall
yield and purity, the present conditions
for accessing N-benzyl-4-formyl-piperidine are superior
to those of the procedures published earlier.28,30,31 The subsequent aldol condensations of 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone 10 with aldehyde mixtures 3a–d + 3′a–d were carried out
according to a similar protocol developed by Imai et al.,32 by avoiding the low temperatures (−78
°C) and toxic solvents reported by Sugimoto et al.13,28 (Table 5). When a
mixture of 2S-methyl-substituted aldehydes 3 + 3′a and 2R-methyl-substituted
aldehydes 3 + 3′b was subjected to
the aldol condensation reaction (Table 5, entries 1 and 2), not trivially separable methylene
products were obtained and their diastereomeric ratios could be determined
by analysis of the signals for the olefinic protons in the crude 1H NMR spectra. The corresponding aldol products were obtained
as inseparable diastereomeric species for both 2-phenyl-substituted
aldehyde mixtures 3 + 3′c and 3 + 3′d (Table 5, entries 3 and 4).

Hydrogenation of alkenes 11a–d + 11′a–d using palladium
on activated carbon was investigated according to a protocol by Sugimoto13 and mixtures of the final donepezil analogues 4 + 4′a–h were obtained
in a moderate to good yield (Table 6). Standard reversed-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) was attempted by using various chromatographic
conditions (for details, see representative method development in
General procedures, Experimental Section),
to isolate the single diasteroisomers from each mixture. All of the
screened conditions gave a single peak for 4 + 4′a–h mixtures (see Section S3 in the Supporting Information), suggesting
that the separation of chirally resolved single species was not possible
in standard reversed-phase HPLC chromatography.

As the 2-substituted donepezil analogues also include
the chiral N-α-phenylethyl moiety, we envisaged
that an unambiguous
evaluation of the biological effects (i.e., acetylcholinesterase inhibition)
produced by a substituent on the piperidine ring (in comparison to
the unsubstituted donepezil) is only feasible with the reference analogues 19 + 19′ (Scheme 3). Indeed, compounds 19 + 19′ bear the chiral N-α-phenylethyl moiety, but
no additional substituent is present on the piperidine ring, allowing
more accurate structure–activity relationship analyses for
this class of compounds. Analogues 19 + 19′ were synthesized in six steps, according to the conditions depicted
in Scheme 3. Briefly,
intermediates 14 and 15 were synthesized
using reported methods.33,34 Piperidone 15 was transformed into methoxymethylene-based compound 16 through an analogous Wittig reaction (with [(Ph3)PCH2OCH3]Cl and LDA) as reported above for 9 + 9′a–d. Intermediate 17 was produced from 16 by mild acidic hydrolysis
with THF/1.6 M HCl (1:1) and converted into 18 by aldol
condensations of 5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone 10. The final
step is the classical reduction of the alkene group in 18 with H2 and Pd/C (Scheme 3), to afford diastereomeric mixtures of the final analogues 19 + 19′.

Biological Activity Studies
It has been reported that
the R and S enantiomers of donepezil 1 interconvert in an aqueous solution at 37 °C due to ketoenol
tautomerism, with a racemization half-life of 78 h.35 A similar spontaneous racemization of the stereocenter
on the indanone moiety is also anticipated for the synthesized donepezil
analogues 4 + 4′a–h. Also, it is worth mentioning that donepezil (Aricept) is not chirally
resolved and is clinically used as a racemic mixture.18,36 In this view, we opted for a preliminary biological screening of
the diastereomeric mixtures 4 + 4′a–h, before engaging in laborious, as well as
lengthy, preparative chiral HPLC separations, to obtain initial evidence
of the AChE inhibitory activity for this series.

The electric
eel AChE (eeAChE) inhibitory activity of the synthesized
donepezil analogues was evaluated in comparison to donepezil. A UV–vis
spectrophotometry-based assay was conducted to calculate the IC50 values for the diastereomeric mixtures (Table 6), according to Ellman et al.37 and Mohamed et al.38 The half-inhibitory concentrations of all compounds possessing a
substituent in position 2 on the piperidine ring (4 + 4′a–h; entries 1–6, Table 6) were evaluated in
comparison to the diastereomeric pair of compounds lacking a substituent
on the piperidine ring, 19 + 19′ (entry
7, Table 6), and the N-benzyl-substituted reference 1 (i.e., donepezil;
entry 8, Table 6).

Piperidine ring unsubstituted diastereomers 19 + 19′ possess an IC50 of 1.83 μM (entry
7, Table 6) and are
approximately 27 times less active than the donepezil 1 (entry 8, Table 6), indicating that the additional methyl group has a detrimental
effect on the drug’s inhibitory activity. Interestingly, 2S-methyl-4S compounds 4 + 4′a possess a lower half-inhibitory concentration of
1.01 μM (entry 1), demonstrating that the additional methyl
group on the piperidine partially compensates for some of the initial
drop of activity caused by the N-S-α-phenylethyl moiety in 19 + 19′.

Among the 2-methyl-substituted analogues (entries 1–4, Table 6), those with 2S-chirality (entries 1 and 2, Table 6) are more active than the ones with 2R-chirality (entries 3 and 4, Table 6). The reduced inhibitory potency of these
derivatives suggests that donepezil is sensitive to stereoselective
substitution in position 2 on the piperidine ring, possibly due to
significant changes in the overall conformation within the enzyme’s
binding pocket and, therefore, affecting also the binding affinities.
Furthermore, both diastereomeric mixtures possessing a phenyl ring
in position 2 on the ring (entries 5, 6, Table 6) showed no activity in the tested concentration
range (0.001–100 μM). In this regard, previous studies
indicate that the bulky phenyl ring could prevent these compounds
from entering the narrow, “swinging-gate”-controlled
entry site of the binding gorge of the enzyme.21,36

Finally, when comparing the IC50 values of the syn-substituted methyl compounds (entries 1, 4, Table 6) to the anti-substituted methyl analogues (entries 2 and 3, Table 6), the syn-compounds
are significantly more active in both cases. 2S,4S-syn-substituted compounds 4 + 4′a are approximately 24 times more active
than the 2R,4S-anti-substituted analogues 4 + 4′c (Figure 3), demonstrating
that the stereochemistry of the substituent in position 4 in relation
to the stereochemistry of the substituent in position 2 (i.e., syn- or anti- conformation) significantly
influences the overall inhibitory activity of the diastereomeric mixtures.

Conclusions
Chirally
resolved 2-substituted 4-piperidones were prepared from
commercially available starting materials in three steps, thereby
providing easy access to building blocks for the assembly of biologically
relevant piperidine-based scaffolds. The reaction conditions reported
for the synthesis of unstable aldehyde-type intermediates from these
piperidine-4-one scaffolds are significantly improved (in terms of
both overall conditions and final yield), compared to other procedures
found in the literature. Furthermore, the aldehydes have been used
to produce novel analogues of donepezil, which are stereochemically
enriched through substituents at position 2 of the piperidine ring.
AChE inhibition studies strongly indicate that the stereochemistry
of substituents on the piperidine ring could play an important role
in the binding behavior of such compounds within AChE’s active
pocket.

a Bellingham and Stanley ADP 220 polarimeter at 589 nm (sodium-D line).
Concentration (c) is in g 100 mL–1. The HPLC analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 system
equipped with an autosampler, a reversed-phase HPLC column (Agilent
Zorbax 300 Å, C-18, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, particle size 3.5 μm),
and a diode-array detector set to monitor 281 nm. The flow rate was

Manganese dioxide
(MnO2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Cat. No. 014340.22—manganese(IV)
oxide, activated, tech. Mn 58% min, 100 g) and further activated by
treatment with dilute nitric acid. MnO2 (50 g) was placed
on a large Büchner funnel and 10% nitric acid (80 mL) was added
slowly. After the addition was completed, the MnO2 cake
was washed with water (2–3 L) until the filtrate was neutral.
The MnO2 was subsequently dried at 105 °C for 2 days.

Crotonaldehyde
(747 mg, 10.70 mmol, 1.3 equiv) in THF (6 mL) was
added dropwise to an ice-cooled solution of vinylmagnesium bromide
in THF (8.00 mmol, 1.0 M in THF, 1.0 equiv) under an atmosphere of
nitrogen. After stirring at room temperature for 1 h, the reaction
mixture was poured into a mixture of saturated NH4Cl (10
mL) and ice (10 g) and stirred vigorously for 5 min. The aqueous solution
was extracted with ether (3 × 15 mL), and the combined organic
phases were dried over MgSO4. Concentration of the solvent

min. Upon addition of the ketone, the reaction was stirred at reflux
for 1 h. Evaporation of acetonitrile in vacuo was followed by the
addition of ethyl acetate (12 mL). The solution was stirred for 15
min, the layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was again extracted
with ethyl acetate (2 × 12 mL). The organic layers were combined
and washed with water (12 mL) and brine (12 mL). The organic layer
was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and
the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography

in THF (2.4 mL) and stirred at 45 °C for 2 h. THF was evaporated
under reduced pressure, and the residue was diluted with water (10
mL). The pH was adjusted to 10 by the addition of an aqueous Na2CO3 solution. The aqueous phase was extracted with
CH2Cl2 (3 × 15 mL), and the combined organic
layers were washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The
solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and crude aldehydes 3a and 3′a were obtained as a colorless

Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition Assay
The inhibitory
activity of compounds 4 + 4′a, 4 + 4′b, 4 + 4′c, 4 + 4′d, 4 + 4′e–f, 4 + 4′g–h, and 19 + 19′ toward AChE (enzyme commission number 3.1.1.7, type VI-S from Electrophorus electricus (electric eel)) was measured
using a protocol based on Ellman’s reagent.37 The 96-well plate format of this assay, as described by
Mohamed,38 was further adjusted to result
in the following protocol. The control compound donepezil (Bertin
Pharma, Cayman, France), and the test compounds were dissolved in
methanol to obtain stock solutions of 10 mM. Twelve further dilutions
were made of each compound using methanol, resulting in final assay
concentrations of 0.001–100 μM. To obtain a 1.5 mM solution,
29.73 mg of 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman’s
reagent, Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in 50 mL of 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(TRIS)-HCl buffer (pH = 8.0) containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.02 M MgCl2 · 6 H2O. A 259 U/mL stock solution of AChE
in buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH = 8.0, 0.1% w/v bovine serum
albumin (BSA)) was prepared, and aliquots of 21 μL were frozen
in Eppendorf tubes and stored at −20 °C. Before running
the assay, one of these aliquots was diluted with buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH = 8.0, 0.1% w/v BSA) to obtain 25 mL of a solution with an enzyme
concentration of 0.22 U/mL. A 15 mM solution of acetylthiocholine
iodide (ATCI, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared by dissolving 108.45 mg
in ultrapure water (25 mL). All of these solutions were prepared freshly
directly before the assay was run. In 96-well plates, 160 μL
of the 1.5 mM DTNB solution was first added, followed by 10 μL
of different concentrations of test compounds. Then, a 0.22 U/mL enzyme
solution was added (50 μL) and incubated at room temperature
for 7 min. The background absorbance was measured at a wavelength
of 412 nm on a POLARstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) microplate reader. The
addition of 30 μL of the 15 mM ATCI solution initiated the enzymatic
reaction, and the time elapsed between the beginning of the pipetting
and the first measurement (t = 0) was noted and kept
consistently at 2 min. Further kinetic measurements were made at different
time intervals (t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 min) after a short
episode of shaking (10 s). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate.
Various control incubations containing 10 μL of methanol were
run alongside the test compounds on each plate. The IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.01)
by applying a nonlinear regression analysis (sigmoidal dose–response
fit with a variable slope).
