Fluorescent organic
materials are commonly π-conjugated planar
molecules. In the present work, however, we report a novel class of
nonconjugated fluorescent molecular cages of trinuclear fluoroborate
complexes (nine samples) with salicylaldehyde-based Schiff base ligands.
Owing to the stress from lone pair electrons of N atom in the triethylamine
bridge, these B(III) complexes exhibit unusual enantiomers with a
tripodlike side-single-opening structure. They emit blue, green, and
red emission with large Stokes shifts (up to 159 nm) and high fluorescence
quantum yields in both solution (up to 0.24) and solid state (up to
0.25), which might contribute to their strong intramolecular hydrogen
bonds and weak intermolecular and intramolecular π–π
interactions. Combining their advantages of nonconjugation and biocompatibility,
these flexible complexes have potential applications in living cell
imaging and anion hosts. We have examined the inherent relationships
between their chemical structures and emission properties and afforded
a new stage for the design of nonconjugated fluorescent fluoroborate
complexes.

Introduction
The development of
innovative organic luminescent materials1 recently has attracted intense interest due to
their wide range of applications in optical probes,2−8 organic light-emitting diodes,9−13 light-emitting electrochemical cells,14,15 and cell imaging.16−19 In general, organic luminescent materials with π-conjugated
planar and rigid structures are extremely susceptible to the problems
of emission “aggregation-caused quenching” (ACQ)20,21 and synthesis difficulty and solubility. On the other hand, nonconjugated
materials with better solubility, higher flexibility, lower cost,
lower cytotoxicity, better biocompatibility, and naturally occurring22 are usually known as nonemissive materials.
Until recently, there are only a limited number of fluorescent pure
organic nonconjugated materials23−26 that emit ultraviolet (UV) and blue aggregation-induced
emission (AIE).23,27,28 Our research group also just reported that some free ligands of
nonconjugated bi- and trisalicylaldehyde-based Schiff bases (SSBs)
show fine-tuned red–green–blue (RGB) AIE properties.29−31

Among the numerous classes
of fluorescent materials, boron(III)
complexes have perhaps the highest potential and have spectacularly
risen in popularity because of their very promising advantages of
relatively high molar absorption coefficients (ε), fine-tuned
emission bands (λem) with high fluorescence quantum
yields (Φ), and photostability. This family of dyes includes
not only well-known boron dipyrromethene32−35 but also its derivatives based
on N^O,36−39 N^C,40,41 and O^O42−44 chelates. Two major
drawbacks of these B(III) complexes are their problems of ACQ and
self-absorption. The ACQ problem of B(III) complexes is mostly caused
by intermolecular π–π stacking interactions between
π-conjugated planar molecules, and the self-absorption problem
results from very narrow Stokes shifts between absorption and emission
spectra. Our research works continually focus on the synthesis, optical
properties, and sensing applications of SSBs29−31,45−47 and their Zn(II), Cu(II), Al(III),
and Pt(II) complexes.48−51 In the literature, there are many examples of fluorescent B(III)
complexes with N^O-bidentate SSB ligands (Figure 1a,b).52−61 However, most of them are mononuclear or binuclear B(III) complexes
(Φ up to 0.90 in solution)58 with
π-conjugated planar molecular structures and often suffer the
ACQ problem. Reported π-conjugated fluorescent trinuclear B(III)
complexes52,58 and nonconjugated fluorescent binuclear
B(III) complexes60,61 are still rare. It is interesting
that free ligands of π-conjugated bi-/tri-SSBs58 and nonconjugated bi-SSBs29 are
usually AIE-active materials, but their B(III) complexes are ACQ-active
materials (Figure 1a).58,61 The free ligands of nonconjugated trimethylamine-linking
tri-SSBs are AIE-active materials as well (Figure 1b),31 and we wonder
if their trinuclear B(III) complexes are AIE- or ACQ-active materials.
Herein, we demonstrate a novel class of trinuclear fluoroborate complexes
with nonconjugated trimethylamine-linking tri-SSB ligands (nine samples, Figure 1b) that exhibit unusual
enantiomers with a tripodlike side-single-opening structure and emit
strong RGB fluorescence in both solution and solid state with large
Stokes shifts.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
The
free tri-SSB ligands
were reasonably easy to be synthesized by the condensation of primary
triethylamine with 3 equiv of salicylaldehyde precursor in ethanol
under refluxing condition.31 The B(III)
complexes were prepared by using BF3–OEt2 and tri-SSB ligands in toluene at 60 °C with excellent yields
(70–88%).61 Most of the B(III) complexes
have a bad solubility in petroleum ether, hexane, and water but a
good solubility in CH3CN, CH2Cl2,
dimethylformamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). All of the complexes
are stable under air. For most of the complexes, good-quality single
crystals could be obtained by the method of slow solvent diffusion/evaporation
(CH2Cl2/hexane). The B(III) complexes are not
new,62 but we report our systematic studies
of the inherent relationships between their chemical structures and
fluorescent properties and the potential application in ion sensing.

Photophysical Properties
Table 1 lists the UV–visible absorption and
fluorescence data of all synthesized B(III) complexes at room temperature.
To gain insight into the nature of the excited states and transitions,
density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) calculations
were also carried out for B with the Gaussian 09 program
package (B3LYP 6-31G(d,p)). The computational absorption spectrum
is virtually identical to the experimental absorption spectrum (Figure 2). The lower energy
absorption band of B (λabs = 347 nm
in CH2Cl2) is reproduced well by the computation,
which predicts one absorption peak at 336 nm. The lower energy absorption
is contributed by S0 → S1 (353 nm, oscillator
strength fOSC = 0.0386, the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) → lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO), 74%; HOMO – 1 → LUMO, 18%; HOMO → LUMO
+ 1, 6%) and S0 → S2 (347 nm, fOSC = 0.0350, HOMO – 1 → LUMO,
50%; HOMO → LUMO + 1, 27%; HOMO – 1 → LUMO +
1, 11%; HOMO → LUMO, 5%). The energy-level and orbital isosurface
diagrams of B (Figure 2) reveal that the HOMO and HOMO – 1 of B are composed primarily of not only two π-conjugated
units of iminomethylphenol but also the nonconjugated triethylamine
bridge, which might contribute to the electron-donating nature of
triethylamine. On the contrary, its LUMO and LUMO + 1 are mainly made
up of the π-functions of iminomethylphenol units rather than
the triethylamine bridge. Therefore, the lower energy absorption can
mainly be assigned to the intraligand π → π* transition
involving molecular orbitals essentially localized on the iminomethylphenol
units and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT, n → π*)
transition from electron-donating trimethylamine (lone pair electrons
of N atom) to the π-conjugated iminomethylphenol units. The
difluoroborate units have little contribution to the lower energy
absorption. For free ligand of tri-SSB,31 however, the lower energy absorption was mostly contributed by n
→ π* transition from electron-donating trimethylamine
to the π-conjugated iminomethylphenol units. These computational
data are consistent with the fact that B (λabs = 346 nm in MeCN) has a red-shifted absorption spectrum
compared with the tri-SSB ligand (λabs = 314 nm in
MeCN).

The absorption spectra
of all of the B(III) complexes in pure organic
solvent of CH2Cl2 (2.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3) are given in Figure 3. The introduction of steric hindrance −Me
(3-Me, λabs = 355 nm in MeCN) or −t-butyl (3-t-Bu, λabs = 353 nm) (Figure 3 and Table 1) substituents to the simplest B (λabs = 347 nm) has little effect on absorption spectra. However, except
the presence of electron-accepting −F (3-F-B,
λabs = 353 nm), the presence of electron-accepting
−Cl (3,5-Cl-B, λabs = 369 nm),
electron-donating −OMe (3-OMe-B, λabs = 374 nm; 5-OMe-B, λabs = 388 nm),
−NEt2 (4-NEt2-B, λabs = 375 and 347 nm), or π-extended system (Naph-B, λabs = 370 and 332 nm) induces obvious red shifts
in absorption spectra. It is obvious that the UV absorption behavior
of 4-NEt2-B solution is unique, which might
be contributed by the strong electron-donating property of NEt2 groups.

Figure 3 Absorption spectra of all of the B(III) complexes in CH2Cl2.

As our previous report,31 free
ligands
of tri-SSBs showed very weak blue fluorescence in the dilute organic
solvents because their intramolecular rotations (IRs) of C–N
and C–C single bonds in the central triethylamine bridge provide
a possible way to nonradiatively annihilate their excited states and
result in the absence of fluorescence consequently. However, it is
unexpected that most of the B(III) complexes exhibit strong fluorescence
in both solid and pure organic solvent of toluene, CH2Cl2, or acetone (Table 1 and Figures 4 and 5). As an example, B emits
strong blue fluorescence (λem = 455–461 nm,
Φ = 0.061–0.083) with large Stokes shifts (up to 110
nm) in low polar solvent of toluene, CH2Cl2,
or acetone. The absence of fluorescence in the solution of free tri-SSB
ligand contributed to the nature of n → π* transition
and IRs;31 on the other hand, the transition
of B originate from not only n → π* but
also π → π* transition (Figure 2), which would help achieve strong fluorescence
in both solution and solid state (see the later discussion). In addition,
the B(III) complexes show an unusual solvent effect. For a usual solvent
effect, high polar solvents would quench the fluorescence intensity
with obvious red shifts in λem. For the B(III) complexes,
high polar solvents, such as ethanol, MeCN, and DMSO, quench the fluorescence
intensity with little red shifts in λem (see the
later discussion).

Figure 4 Emission spectra of B in different organic
solvents
(1.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3).

Figure 5 Photographs (top: under room light; bottom:
under 360 nm UV light)
of the selected complexes in solid state and CH2Cl2 (1.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3).

In dilute CH2Cl2, the B(III) complexes with
different substituents have various emission peaks (λem: 455–530 nm) and colors (blue, green, and green-yellow).
The substituent effect of fluorescence spectra (Table 1 and Figure 6) is much different from that of absorption spectra
(Figure 3). The presence
of a π-extended system (Naph-B, λem = 455 nm) to the B (λem = 459 nm)
leads to blue shifts in fluorescence spectra, but other substituents
(3-Me-B, λem = 477 nm; 3-t-Bu-B, λem = 470 nm; 3-F-B, λem = 470 nm; 3,5-Cl-B, λem = 488 nm; 4-NEt2-B, λem = 482 nm; 3-OMe-B, λem = 517
nm; 5-OMe-B, λem = 530 nm) result in
red-shifted emission (Figure 6 and Table 1). Most of the solid-state B(III) complexes exhibit red-shifted fluorescence
(λem up to 579 nm) compared with those solution samples,
except 3-t-Bu-B (λem = 461 and 470 nm in solid and CH2Cl2, respectively).
These experimental results reveal that this substituent effect is
a simple and useful tool to well tune λem and achieve
RGB emission.

Figure 6 Normalized emission spectra of all of the complexes in
CH2Cl2 (top, 1.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3) and solid state (bottom).

All fluorescence quantum yields (Table 1) of the B(III) complexes in
solution and
solid were measured by the optical dilute method with a standard of
quinine sulfate (Φr = 0.55, quinine in 0.05 mol dm–3 sulfuric acid) and an integrating sphere, respectively.
Although the complexes with a nonconjugated triethylamine linker have
a small π-conjugated system, the fluorescence quantum yields
of some B(III) complexes are unexpectedly high (Table 1). In dilute CH2Cl2, the presence of bulky hindering substituents of −t-butyl (3-t-Bu-B, Φ
= 0.13) and −NEt2 (4-NEt2-B, Φ = 0.13) and π-extended system (Naph-B, Φ = 0.078) would improve fluorescence quantum yields (B, Φ = 0.064), but the introduction of −F (3-F-B, Φ = 0.034) and −Cl (3,5-Cl-B, Φ = 0.030) would bring adverse effects. A similar substituent
effect was observed for the solid-state B(III) complexes. However,
solid-state free tri-SSB ligands have a much different substituent
effect in that the introduction of −F and −Cl would
help improve AIE, but −t-butyl, −NEt2, and π-extended systems would weaken AIE. This is further
confirmed by the fact that the B(III) complexes and free ligands have
different transition natures.

X-ray Single-Crystal Structures
and Mechanism of Fluorescence
The molecule chemical structures
and X-ray single-crystal arrangements
play a key role for whether ACQ-or AIE-active materials.63−67 To achieve a high fluorescence quantum yield, normal fluorescent
materials usually need a planar π-conjugation and might suffer
the ACQ problem consequently. On the other hand, AIE-active materials,
such as propeller-type tetraphenylethene, usually are nonplanar π-conjugated
molecules with not only strong intermolecular aromatic HAr···π hydrogen bonds but also weak intermolecular
face-to-face π–π interactions,27,28 in which the former can ensure the elimination of the IRs and the
latter would prevent the formation of excimer. For nonconjugated AIE-active
free ligands of tri-SSBs, the restriction of C–C and C–N
single bond rotations in the central alkyl chain bridges through some
other noncovalent intermolecular interactions, such as N···H,
O···H, C···H, F···H,
Cl···H, and H···H, must be considered
as well.31

It is interesting that
the reported bi-/tri-SSB-based B(III) complexes58,61 and free bi-/tri-SSB ligands29−31 (Figure 1a) are ACQ- and AIE-active materials, respectively,
but the tri-SSB-based B(III) complexes in this work emit strong fluorescence
in both solution and solid state. To investigate the effect of molecular
structures and arrangements, the X-ray single-crystal structures of B (CCDC: 1836233), 3,5-Cl-B (CCDC: 1836234),
and 4-NEt2-B (CCDC: 1836235) are depicted
in Figures 7–9 and S1–S3 (in
the Supporting Information). Unlike reported planar bi-/tri-SSB-based
B(III) complexes,58,61 the B(III) complexes are unusual
tripodlike side-single-opening cages like free tri-SSB ligands31 due to the stress from lone pair electrons of
N atom in the triethylamine bridge (Figure 2).

Figure 7 X-ray single-crystal structures and packing
of B molecules:
(a) packing in a unit cell (H atoms are omitted and green arrows indicate
the opening direction of molecular cages); (b) intramolecular hydrogen
bonds (Htriethylamine: 1 = 2.329 Å, 3 = 2.822 Å,
4 = 7 = 2.557 Å, 5 = 2.524 Å, 8 = 2.509 Å, 9 = 2.546
Å, 11 = 2.759 Å; HN=CH: 2 = 2.458 Å,
6 = 2.404 Å, 10 = 2.595 Å); (c) intermolecular face-to-face
π–π interactions of the two close molecules (H
atoms are omitted); and (d) enantiomers.

As shown in Figure 7, the dihedral angles among three panels of π-conjugated
iminomethylphenol
are about 60°, resulting in no intramolecular face-to-face π–π
interactions (overlaps in π-conjugated units) in one B molecule. In dilute organic solution, it is obvious that the C–C
and C–N single bonds in the central triethylamine bridge might
be rotatable, which would afford a possible way to nonradiatively
annihilate its excited states and quench the fluorescence consequently.
However, there are many intramolecular hydrogen bonds between F atoms
(BF2) and H atoms (Htriethylamine: 2.329–2.822
Å; HN=CH: 2.404–2.595 Å, Figure 7b), which would help
block these IRs and lead to the presence of fluorescence in dilute
organic solution. In the solid state, B molecules exhibit
an edge-to-face spiral packing motif (Figure 7a), in which the opening directions of B molecular cages are in staggered form. Even though B molecules have a short interplanar distance (d) of 3.45 Å (Figure 7b), they are cross-stacking and result in weak intermolecular
face-to-face π–π interactions between two neighbor B molecules (Figure S1), which
are beneficial to prevent the formation of excimer and achieve solid-state
fluorescence. It is not surprising to find one pair of enantiomers
(1:1) in the single crystals of B (Figure 7d) because the C–N and C–C
single bonds cannot rotate freely in solid.31,50 Since the intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Figure 2b) might help stabilize the existence of
two enantiomers in dilute organic solution, it is possible to separate
two enantiomers by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography.
This is totally different from the enantiomers of free ligands.31 The free ligands do not have such intramolecular
hydrogen bonds and thus the enantiomers of free ligands might be unstable
to separate in dilute organic solution. Furthermore, we speculate
that these intramolecular hydrogen bonds would be destroyed by high
polar solvents through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between solvent
and B molecules, and thus the fluorescence would be quenched
by high polar solvents (Figure 4 and Table 1). This finding is in contrast to the phenomenon of polar solvent-induced
fluorescence.68,69

Like B molecules, 3,5-Cl-B molecules
have a similar molecular structure and arrangement (Figure 8a). Many intramolecular hydrogen
bonds (Htriethylamine: 2.274–2.777 Å; HN=CH: 2.282–2.593 Å, Figure 8b) and two enantiomers (1:1) (Figure 8d) are also found in the two
adjacent 3,5-Cl-B molecules. However, 3,5-Cl-B molecules show moderate intramolecular face-to-face π–π
interactions with a shorter d of 3.39 Å (Figures 8c and S2). Moreover, the density of 3,5-Cl-B single crystals is 1.630 g cm–3, which is much
larger than that of B (1.456 g cm–3) single crystals. The above factors indicate that 3,5-Cl-B molecules are more likely to aggregate in both solution and solid
state and have weaker fluorescence than B molecules consequently.
Moreover, the electron-donating nature of −Cl substituents
might also affect its fluorescence properties. This chlorination and
fluorination effect for the B(III) complexes is much different from
that for the free ligands.31 For the free
ligands, the chlorination and fluorination would help induce intermolecular
F···H, Cl···H, or Cl···Cl
interactions to enhance AIE.

Our previous works29−31 demonstrated that bulky −NEt2 and
−t-Bu substituents might prevent the molecules
from packing tightly, resulting in the absence of AIE from nonconjugated
free SSB ligands. With bulky −NEt2 substituents, 4-NEt2-B molecules have a similar molecular structure
and arrangement (Figure 9a) as B molecules. Many intramolecular
hydrogen bonds (2.479–2.541 Å; HN=CH: 2.672 Å, Figure 9b) and two enantiomers (Figure 9d) exist as well. However, the density (1.312 g cm–3) and d (3.54 Å without intermolecular
face-to-face π–π interactions, Figures 9c and S3) of 4-NEt2-B single crystals is
the smallest and largest, respectively, which reveal that the bulky
−NEt2 substituents would help prevent 4-NEt2-B molecules from aggregating to obtain the strongest
fluorescence in both solution and solid state. A similar effect of
bulky substituents is observed for 3-t-Bu-B as well. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that the electron-donating
nature of −NEt2 substituents might also enhance
its fluorescence.61 There are B-level alerts
in the checkCIF report of 4-NEt2-B due to
the disorder of the −NEt2 group in the single-crystal
structures. Such disorder is quite common in terminal alkyl groups.50

(c) intermolecular face-to-face π–π interactions

The B(III) complexes have small
π-conjugated systems but
strong emission with large Stokes shifts, which are consistent with
the characteristics of the reported pure organic phosphorescent compounds.70 However, time-resolved emission spectra (Figure 10) reveal that the
emission decay lifetime of B is 3.14 and 12.61 ns in
dilute CH2Cl2 solution and solid, respectively.
The emission decay lifetime of 4-NEt2-B is
10.3 and 22.3 ns in dilute CH2Cl2 solution and
solid, respectively. This indicates that the emission of the B(III)
complexes originates from fluorescence rather than phosphorescence.
These relatively long emission decay lifetimes and large Stokes shifts
of B(III) complexes might be contributed by their transition nature
of the ICT process (Figure 2).

Anion Host Properties
As our previous work,31 the cagelike free ligands were used as anion
hosts to detect anions through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and
thus we used B, 5-OMe-B, and 3,5-Cl-B to
test their fluorescence responses upon adding different anions (Figures 11, S4, and S5). Various sodium or potassium salts
(1.0–0.10 mol dm–3 in water) were added to
dilute dye solution (2.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3 in DMSO) by a microsyringe. The sensing performance
would be much worse if other solvents, such as CH2Cl2, MeCN, EtOH, and MeOH, were used. As example, upon adding
many anions, including OH–, F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, NO3–, NO2–, CO32–, HCO3–, S2–, HS–, SO42–, SO32–, HSO3–, PO43–, HPO42–, H2PO4–, P2O74–, and MeCO2–, to dilute B DMSO solution, some of them, such
as OH– (Φ = 0.15), S2–,
F–, and PO43–, would
lead to turn on the fluorescence of B, but others will have little
effects on the fluorescence (Figure 11). Similar fluorescence enhancements are observed upon
adding different anions to dilute 5-OMe-B solution (OH–, Φ = 0.13, Figure S4). However, 3,5-Cl-B shows different fluorescence enhancements
(Figure S5). Many anions, such as S2– (Φ = 0.15), PO43–, F–, CO32–, HCO3–, P2O74–, MeCO2–, HPO42–, HS–, and SO32–,
would induce fluorescence enhancements. Under the same experimental
conditions, the sensing performances of B and 3,5-Cl-B are much different from those of free ligands,31 which reveal that adding anions would not decompose the
complexes to form the free ligands. We guess that the fluorescence
could be regenerated by adding anions through intermolecular hydrogen
bonds between the B(III) complexes and anions. These findings indicate
that the B(III) complexes have potential applications in anion hosts/probes.

spectra of B (2.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3 in DMSO, excited at 390 nm) upon the
addition of 100 equiv of different anions.

Living Cell Imaging
Since nonconjugated materials might
have low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility, we tried to use 4-NEt2-B and 3-Me-B for the application
of living cell imaging. The cervical cells were imaged by 4-NEt2-B and 3-Me-B using a standard cell-staining
protocol. As shown in Figure 12, incubated with the 4-NEt2-B and 3-Me-B, over 90% cells are live, similar to those in the control
experiments in the absence of the dyes, indicating that these dyes
have little toxicity on the living cells. In the control experiments,
cervical cells exhibit negligible background fluorescence, but intense
intracellular green fluorescence is observed if cervical cells are
incubated with 4-NEt2-B and 3-Me-B.

f).

Conclusions
In
the present work, we report the nonconjugated trinuclear B(III)
complexes that exhibit unique enantiomers with a tripodlike side-single-opening
structure. The normal fluorescent B(III) complexes often suffer ACQ
problem with narrow Stokes shifts. Although these B(III) complexes
link with a nonconjugated triethylamine bridge, they display strong
RGB fluorescence in both solution and solid due to the presence of
strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the absence of intermolecular
and intramolecular π–π interactions. Moreover,
they also have relatively long emission decay lifetimes and large
Stokes shifts through the ICT transition process. Further studies
on the separation of the enantiomers of B(III) complexes are currently
under way in our cooperative laboratory. Therefore, we believe that
these simple Schiff base-based nonconjugated trinuclear B(III) complexes
provide a new paradigm in the design of nonconjugated fluorescent
materials for developing advanced organic optoelectronic devices,
florescent anion hosts/probes, chiral materials, cell imaging, and
so on.

Experimental Procedures
Materials and Instrumentation
All
reagents were purchased
from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. All
of the ligands were prepared according to our previous report.521H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were recorded
in DMSO-d6. Chemical shifts are reported
in ppm using tetramethylsilane as internal standard. UV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded using a U5100 (Hitachi) spectrophotometer
with quartz cuvettes of 1 cm pathlength. Fluorescence spectra were
obtained using an F-7000 Fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi)
at room temperature or 77 K (in liquid nitrogen). The photon multiplier
voltage was 400 V. Samples in solution and powder were contained in
1 cm pathlength quartz cuvettes (3.5 mL volume) and quartz tube, respectively.
The single crystals were obtained by a slow diffusion/evaporation
of CH2Cl2/hexane solution at room temperature
during about two weeks.

Measurement of Fluorescence Quantum Yield
(Φ)
The quantum yield of a solution sample was measured
by the optical
dilute method with a standard of quinine sulfate according to our
previous report.45 The quantum yield of
a solid sample was measured by an integrating sphere.

Computational
Details
The program Gaussian 09 was employed
to perform DFT and TD-DFT calculations based on the X-ray single-crystal
structure of B. These included geometry optimizations
of the singlet ground state and the triplet lowest-lying structures.
TD-DFT was used to calculate 80 singlet–singlet transitions.
CH2Cl2 was used as solvent in the TD-DFT calculations
(pcm method). Geometries were optimized in the gas phase.

Cell Culture
Methods and Imaging71
The imaging
of HeLa cells was finished by Fluorescence
Vertical Microscope LEICA DM2500. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin
(100 units mL–1), streptomycin (100 mg mL–1), and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After removing the incubating
media and rinsing with PBS for three times, the cells were incubated
with the dye (1.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed
three times with PBS and incubated with aqueous alkali for 20 min.
At last, the cells were imaged with a confocal microscope.

Measurement
of Anion Hosts
Various sodium or potassium
salts (1.0–0.10 mol dm–3 in water) were added
to dilute dye solution (2.0 × 10–5 mol dm–3 in DMSO) by a microsyringe. Fluorescence measurements
were monitored at about 1 h after the addition of the anion to the
dye solution at room temperature.

Synthesis of Complexes
The free tri-SSB ligands were
reasonably easy to synthesize by the condensation of primary triethylamine
with 3 equiv of salicylaldehyde precursor in ethanol under refluxing
condition.31 The mixture of salicyaldehyde
or salicylaldehyde derivatives (3.1 mmol) and the corresponding triamine
(1.0 mmol) in 20 mL of ethanol solution was refluxed at 78 °C
for 5 h. After the reaction was complete, the mixture was cooled to
0 °C, and then the product in crystal or powder was collected
by filtration.

The B(III) complexes were prepared by using BF3–OEt2 and tri-SSB ligands in toluene at
60 °C with excellent yields.58 The
free ligand (1 mmol) was dissolved in dry 20 mL of toluene. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (0.5 mL) (10
mmol) was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min
at 60 °C, after which boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (10
mmol) was added dropwise. The final mixture was stirred for 5 h at
60 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature.
CH2Cl2 (5 mL) was added, and the crude mixture
was washed with water (3–2 mL). The organic layer was separated,
dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated to dryness.
The residue was purified by flash chromatography (CH2Cl2).
