Flow-through optical chromatography
(FT-OC), an advanced mode of optical chromatography, achieved baseline
separation of a mixture of silica microparticles (SiO2,
1.00 and 2.50 μm) and a mixture of polystyrene microparticles
(PS, 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 μm) based on particle size. Comparisons
made between experimentally determined velocities for the microparticles
and theoretically derived velocities from Mie theory and Stokes’
law validated the data collection setup and the data analysis for
FT-OC. A population shift in live macrophages (cell line IC-21, ATCC
TIB-186) responding to environmental stimuli was sensitively detected
by FT-OC. The average velocity of macrophages stressed by nutritional
deprivation was decreased considerably together with a small but statistically
significant increase in cell size. Mie scattering calculations demonstrated
that the small increase in cell size of macrophages stressed by nutritional
deprivation was not entirely responsible for this decrease. Confocal
fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies
revealed morphological changes of macrophages induced by nutritional
deprivation, and these changes were more likely responsible for the
decrease in average velocity detected by FT-OC. Confocal Raman microspectroscopy
was used to shed light upon biochemical transformations of macrophages
suffering from nutritional deprivation.

Introduction
Innate immune cells such as neutrophils,
macrophages, and natural killer cells play key roles in the early
defense against invading pathogens. Detecting stimuli at the single-cell
level and initiating cascading response mechanisms, they are essentially
living sensors to the onset of infection or exposure events. Analytical
methods sensitive to physiological changes of individual immune cells
could thus allow early exposure detection before symptoms appear,
providing valuable increased time windows for countermeasures. Microfluidic
flow-cytometry-based methods are appealing with capabilities for high-throughput
analysis of bio-physical/chemical properties with sensitivity at the
single-cell level.1 However, rather than
running a multitude of high-specificity, label-dependent assays for
unknown targets, label-free methods with broad specificity and minimal
sample preparation requirements are attractive where detection of
initial physiological shifts could then prompt further, more targeted
diagnosis.

Label-free flow cytometry approaches that are widely
available with sensitivity to cellular biophysical properties include
forward/side light-scatter detection, providing sensitivity to the
refractive index, size, and granularity of cells.1 Other cellular biophysical properties that can be probed
by microfluidic-based methods include impedance2 and cellular deformability.3 High-throughput imaging cytometry supported by computational analysis
is also being utilized.4 The rationale
in sensing biophysical changes is that they can accompany the complex
biochemistry of immune cell activation and may be correlated to varying
degrees. Raman spectroscopy is an example of another label-free method
that has been demonstrated with microfluidic analysis5,6 and can directly probe biochemical changes.

Optical chromatography
(OC), originally termed by Kaneta et al.,7 is an additional microfluidic-based, label-free technique capable
of separating particles8 and carrying out
dynamic analysis of single live cells.9 OC shares some similarities with optical tweezers.10,11 Both use a laser and involve the interplay of two forces exerted
on the particle of interest. Optical tweezers use a highly focused
laser beam, and the two forces involved in the manipulation of particles
are the scattering force (or radiation pressure force), which propels
particles along the direction of light propagation, and the gradient
force, which attracts the particle along the spatial gradient of light
intensity to the focal point of the focused beam. OC uses a weakly
focused laser beam on particles in a microfluidic flow, and particle
discrimination relies upon the interaction of the radiation pressure
force against the viscous drag force. The selectivity of OC is dependent
on the intrinsic physical/biophysical nature of the particle/cell
such as the size, shape, refractive index, surface roughness, and
cellular structure.

To date, OC has received limited attention,
but for the application outlined here, it is a potentially valuable
approach. One of the advantages of OC is its flexibility of operating
either in the static mode for precise single-cell analysis or flow-through
mode FT-OC with high throughput. In a static OC mode, laser power
is fixed, and the flow rate of the fluid is adjusted in order to balance
a single particle/cell at a predetermined position within the flow
channel. Any intrinsic differences between particles/cells can be
detected from changes in the flow rate, which correlates to changes
in radiation pressure forces experienced by the particles/cells. Size
differences as small as 70 nm between polymer microspheres, refractive
index differences well below 0.06, and high refractive index coatings
as small as 14 nm have been detected.12,13 Additional
information about the particles/cells can also be derived from optical
images and light scattering patterns by the particles/cells. Raman
scattered light can also be analyzed offering additional potential
for integrated data acquisition.

FT-OC is an advanced mode of
OC that also relies on the interplay of the radiation pressure force
and the viscous drag force. Instead of balancing a single particle/cell
at a predetermined position, FT-OC uses a properly chosen fluid flow
rate against a fixed laser power and allows the particles/cells carried
by the fluid to pass through the detection window continuously. The
information collected by FT-OC includes the average velocity, average
cross-sectional area, shape, and morphology of the individual particle/cell.
Due to the nature of uninterrupted measurement of particles/cells
passing through the detection window, FT-OC has a much higher throughput
than static OC and scans hundreds of cells per minute. Thus, FT-OC
offers configurational flexibility and compatibility for integrated
acquisition of complimentary data for multivariate analysis. Here,
we report the first demonstration of FT-OC in the rapid baseline separation
of microparticles based on their size differences as well as the sensitive
label-free detection of live macrophages undergoing autophagy in response
to environmental stimuli, in this case, nutritional deprivation. Macrophages,
although tissue resident cells, are highly amenable to laboratory
culturing and thus serve as useful models for method development.
Autophagy is a cellular process in which cytoplasmic contents are
degraded within the lysosome/vacuole, and the resulting macromolecular
constituents are recycled.14 The macrophage
innate immune response and autophagic processes are closely connected
and modulated by TLR (Toll-like receptor) activation, inflammasome
activation, and bacterial infection.15

In our previous work on label-free detection of Bacillus
anthracis spore uptake in macrophages using static
OC,16 an increased radiation pressure force
was observed on macrophages that phagocytosed Bacillus
anthracis spores when compared to control cells. In
the present study, biophysical changes of IC-21 macrophages induced
by autophagy were sensitively detected by FT-OC as manifested by the
increased radiation pressure force experienced by cells undergoing
autophagy. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal microscopy, and
confocal Raman microscopy analyses are also used for additional correlation
of bio-physcial/chemical changes with the observed population shifts
from FT-OC.

Results and Discussion
Basic Theory of Radiation Pressure Force
When an electromagnetic wave interacts with a small particle, the
wave radiation can be scattered or absorbed by the particle. These
interactions result in a momentum transfer from the radiation to the
particle. This momentum transfer creates a force on the particle,
which is referred to as the radiation pressure force. For a plane
electromagnetic wave of incident intensity I0, the radiation pressure force, Fpr, depends upon the radiation pressure cross section Cpr and the phase velocity of the light in the surrounding
medium of refractive index n1. The equation
for the radiation pressure force is given by Kerker17 1  where c denotes the speed of light in vacuum. If
the incident radiation is from a laser beam with a Gaussian profile,
the intensity distribution is given by18 2  where P denotes the laser power and Abeam is the beam area. The equation for the radiation
pressure force from a Gaussian beam is given by 3  In this equation, a is the
radius of the spherical particle, and w0 is the beam waist or radius. The radiation pressure cross section Cpr for a spherical particle of radius a can be calculated from Mie theory.

In Mie theory,
one defines dimensionless radiation pressure efficiency factor Qpr as 4  where G = πa2 is the spherical particle’s
geometrical cross section. The radiation pressure efficiency factor
is given by 5  where Qext is the extinction efficiency factor, Qsca is the scattering efficiency factor, and
⟨cos θ⟩ is the asymmetry factor g. If the particle’s refractive index is a real number, there
is no absorption, and 6  Thus, for
a nonabsorbing particle, the expression for the radiation pressure
efficiency factor reduces to 7  The asymmetry factor g can also be defined as the scattering diagram of the particle,
which represents the angular distribution of the scattered radiation
about a specified direction. If the particle scatters radiation isotropically, g is zero. If the particle scatters radiation in the forward
direction, g > 0. If most of the radiation is
scattered backward, g < 0.

The calculated
asymmetry factors (g), the radiation pressure cross
sections (Cpr), and the radiation pressure
forces (Fpr) for silica microparticles
(SiO2, 1.00 and 2.50 μm in diameter), polystyrene
microparticles (1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 μm in diameter), and macrophages
are summarized in Table 1.

Separation of Microparticles
Using FT-OC
To assess the capacity of FT-OC, separations
of a mixture of two different sizes of SiO2 microparticles
and a mixture of three different sizes of PS microparticles were performed
with a fixed laser power of 3 W. SiO2 microparticles have
a lower refractive index (∼1.450)19 than that of PS microparticles (∼1.572).20 At a total flow rate of 1400 nL/min, the average velocities
determined for SiO2 microparticles were 877.1 ± 16.4
μm/s for 1.00 μm SiO2 microparticles (n = 771) and 673.5 ± 32.4 μm/s for 2.50 μm
particles (n = 487). A baseline separation of two
populations of SiO2 microparticles based on their sizes
was achieved, and the histogram is presented in Figure 1a. A higher total flow rate of 3000 nL/min
was applied during the separation of PS particles (Figure 1b), and the measured average
velocities were 1180.2 ± 18.9, 679.2 ± 13.4, and 342.4 ±
14.0 μm/s for 1.00 μm (n = 1213), 2.00
μm (n = 363), and 3.00 μm (n = 250) PS particles, respectively. It is worth mentioning that there
were occasions in which more than one particle appeared in the detection
window. Obviously, the optical forces exerted on a trailing particle
were not the same as those on particles without a preceding particle.
A filter for the “followers” in the software was used
to remove these particles from the data set.

Figure 1 FT-OC separation of microparticles.

(c) Plots of the average velocity against the position of PS microparticles
in parallel with the detection window.

The force interactions on each single particle can be illustrated
by following the trajectories of three differently sized PS microparticles. Figure 1c depicts the change
in velocity of PS microparticles versus the x position
as they were passing through the detection window carried by a fluid
flow. At x position > 400 μm outside the
focal region of the laser beam, all three differently sized particles
had similar velocities. As the particles entered the focal region
of the laser beam, the radiation pressure force, Fpr, caused deceleration of the particles at x < 300 μm, with larger particles displaying a greater decrease
in velocities. After a short time (x < 200 μm),
an equilibrium was reached where Fpr = Fdrag (Fdrag is the
drag force from the fluid flow), and the net force exerted on the
particle became zero. The average velocities were determined within
this region (x < 200 μm) for SiO2 and PS microparticles are summarized in Table 1.

Comparisons were made between experimentally
determined average velocities of particles (Vexp) and the calculated velocities (Vcal), which were obtained using the radiation pressure force Fpr from Mie theory and the equilibrium condition Fpr = Fdrag. If the
particle is nearly spherical and suspended in a viscous and incompressible
fluid with very small Reynolds numbers, Fdrag is defined by Stokes’ law21 8  where η denotes
the dynamic viscosity, a is the radius of the spherical
object, and V is the velocity of the particle relative
to the fluid flow, which can be expressed as 9  where V(laser-off) is the velocity of the particle
determined while the laser is turned off.

Applying the equilibrium
condition 10  Vcal values can
be obtained, and they are in good agreement with Vexp values, thereby validating the setup for data collection
and the data analysis of FT-OC.

Detection of the Responses
of Macrophage Cells to Environmental Stimuli
FT-OC
Macrophages
(200,000 cells/mL) were injected into the sample channel, and FT-OC
was performed. With control cells freshly suspended in PBS (phosphate
buffered saline, pH 7.4) and the total flow rate set at 2000 nL/min,
the average size (the cross-sectional area of the cell) of this population
was recorded as 79.6 ± 8.8 μm2, which corresponds
to an average cell diameter of 10.0 ± 1.1 μm. The average
velocity was determined as 636.8 ± 36.0 μm/s (935 cells),
which is in good agreement with the calculated velocity from the radiation
pressure force Fpr obtained from Mie theory
using a refractive index of 1.384,22 the
equilibrium condition Fpr = Fdrag, and a cell diameter of 10.0 μm (see Table 1). Macrophages were
next suspended in PBS for 2 h (subjected to nutritional deprivation)
and analyzed by FT-OC. The average velocity for the population was
determined as 590.0 ± 47.8 μm/s (767 cells), which is significantly
slower than that for the macrophages not subjected to nutritional
deprivation. The average diameter of the stressed macrophages increased
slightly to 10.2 ± 1.3 μm, a small but statistically significant
increase (p < 0.001) when compared to the control
cells. The results of FT-OC from the control-cell population and the
nutrient-deprived-cell population are presented in Figure 2a,b. FT-OC sensitively detected
the changes in cell size and average velocity, but the slight increase
in size for the nutrient-deprived cells (10.2 μm vs 10.0 μm)
cannot be entirely responsible for the larger decrease in the average
velocity (590.0 μm/s vs 636.8 μm/s). This discrepancy
was further confirmed by the small differences in Fpr values (31.9 pN vs 30.5 pN) from Mie calculations solely
based on the small size change and the resulting Vcal values (848.0 μm/s vs 876.0 μm/s) between
the nutrient-deprived-cell population and the control-cell population.
Further studies are necessary to identify the other contributing factors
for the increase in radiation pressure force experienced by the stressed
cell population. Note also that the piconewton-level laser forces
experienced by the cells over subsecond timeframes are unlikely to
impact cellular activity and viability.

macrophages from control macrophages in (a) average velocity and (b)
average cross-sectional area.

As shown in the radiation theory section, optical force and
scattering are interrelated. Previous work on Bacillus
anthracis spore uptake in macrophage cells showed
qualitatively that 1064 nm radiation pressure differences experienced
by cells before and after spore uptake were accompanied by significant
side-scatter changes.16 Thus, the optical
force discrimination in this work indicates that changes in scattering
may also occur for macrophages undergoing autophagy. Scatter measurements
at 1064 nm, generally not used with commercial flow cytometers, may
also offer improved discrimination in certain cases versus wavelengths
in the visible region.16 The refractive
index and scattering are both wavelength-dependent, and higher power
can be used at 1064 nm since biological samples are typically nonabsorbing
in this region. Acquisition of quantitative scattering data in the
OC configuration used for this work should also complement the force
and imaging cytometry. This will be addressed in future work.

Nutritional deprivation can cause cell stress and is a well-known
environmental stimulus that induces autophagy. It is likely that the
difference detected in FT-OC between control and stressed cells reflects
the changes resulting from cells undergoing autophagy. Various groups
have experimentally determined that the actin cytoskeleton is involved
in every stage of autophagy.23−25 Actin-dependent cellular processes
are typically associated with membrane dynamics, and the coordinated
polymerization of actin filaments against cellular membranes provides
the force for these processes.26 It is
not surprising that, due to the interplay between the actin cytoskeleton
and the plasma membrane, remodeling of the cell membrane is also involved
in autophagy. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and remodeling
of the plasma membrane induces morphological changes and may increase
the Fpr experienced by nutrient-deprived
cells. To validate the changes in the actin cytoskeleton and plasma
membrane of stressed cells, differential interference contrast (DIC)
microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) were used to study fixed and stained cells as well as the live
cells.

Optical Microscopy
To acquire higher resolution images
of cells in suspension, that is, mimic the condition under which FT-OC
was carried out, control and nutrient-deprived cells were fixed while
they were in suspension, and their DIC images (Figure 3a) were obtained after cells settled at the
bottom of a FluoroDish (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL).
The images of nutrient-deprived cells reveal substantial formation
of filopodia. DIC and corresponding confocal fluorescence images of
fixed, attached macrophages (both control and nutrient-deprived) further
disclosed the distinct morphological differences between the two populations:
the substantial formation of filopodia at the expense of lamellipodia
and an overall decrease of podosomes in nutrient-deprived cells (Figure 3b). It is well known
that lamellipodia are designed for persistent protrusion over a surface,
and filopodia perform sensory and exploratory functions to steer cells
depending on cues from the environment.27 Arp2/3 complexes (actin-related protein 2/3) and formins are the
two members of numerous different actin regulators that form the “right
structure at the right place and time” within the cell.28 Arp2/3 complexes promote the formation of lamellipod
extensions.29 Formins, on the other hand,
are responsible for the formation of filopods.30,31 Both Arp2/3 complexes and formins are important actin assembly factors
in autophagy.32 A competition between different
assembly factors for finite monomeric actin to form different actin
structures is a general mechanism at work within the actin cytoskeleton.28 While macrophages respond to environmental stimuli,
nutritional deprivation in this case, the substantial formation of
filopodia structures was favored in accordance to their sensory and
exploratory functions. The observed decrease in podosome structures
in nutrient-deprived cells is probably related to the reduction of
lamellipodia formation.

(left) and nutrient-deprived (right). (b) DIC and corresponding confocal
fluorescence microscopy images (green: actin filament stain, blue:
DAPI nuclear stain) of fixed attached cells: control (left) and nutrient-deprived
(right).

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM images of live control and stressed cells were obtained using
the QI mode with a set point of 400 pN. One of the major advantages
of QI is the absence of lateral forces on live cells. A complete force–distance
curve is recorded at each pixel, which can be used to determine Young’s
modulus values by fitting a Hertz model using JPK data processing
software. Height images and pixel difference images are presented
in Figure 4. As observed
from our confocal microscopic studies, the nutrient-deprived cells
exhibited more extensive filopodia formation with areas of rougher
cell surfaces adjacent to these structures. Average Young’s
modulus values of the control cells (n = 5) were
measured using an area of 1.5 × 1.5 μm at different locations
that ranged from 6.10 ± 1.78 kPa at the cell height of 4.27 ±
0.07 μm on top of the nucleus to 17.66 ± 4.09 kPa at the
cell height of 1.91 ± 0.12 μm near the outer edge. Corresponding
values for nutrient-deprived cells (n = 5) were 5.97
± 0.86 and 8.69 ± 0.75 kPa at cell heights of 5.64 ±
0.03 and 1.78 ± 0.10 μm, respectively. Generally, Young’s
modulus values are higher at the outer edges of the cells, and in
these areas, stressed cells were softer than control cells. It is
worth mentioning that during data acquisition using the QI mode on
live cells, the indentation depth never exceeded 500 nm; therefore,
the impact from the substrate underneath the cells should be negligible.

macrophage and (b) a nutrient-deprived macrophage.

Confocal Raman Microspectroscopy
DIC images, confocal fluorescence images, AFM images, and Young’s
modulus values confirmed the changes in morphology and membrane elasticity
of stressed cells induced by nutritional deprivation. Confocal Raman
microspectroscopy is an additional method that is sensitive to biochemical
changes reflecting physiological states and processes in cells.33 In this work, we utilized resonance Raman sensitivity
to cytochrome Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox states34,35 as an indicator of cellular response to nutritional deprivation.
At 514 nm, excitation signal enhancements from macrophages were detected
at 1584, 1397, 1362, 1312, and 1172 cm–1, attributed
primarily to reduced cytochrome c (Figure 5d).35 This particular
signal enhancement will decrease when cytochrome redox ratios shift
to greater oxidized levels, and the sensitivity is found to provide
a particularly strong biomarker of the cellular response to PBS versus
media. To compare cells, the 1172 cm–1 peak area
was normalized against the 1003 cm–1 phenylalanine
peak area (generally a representative signal for proteins). Both of
these peaks are in regions that showed little interference from other
Raman bands. Figure 5a,b presents a comparison of Raman maps of the 1172/1003 cm–1 ratios for four cells in media and four cells at 2–3 h after
transferring from media to PBS. These images show that 1172 cm–1 relative intensities are consistently low for nutrient-deprived
cells (all maps are shown on the same relative scale). This is further
quantified in Figure 5e, which shows histograms of the composite top 10 intensity values
from each of the four images in Figure 5a,b. The clear demarcation demonstrates confocal Raman
microspectroscopy as a valuable complimentary method in combination
with FT-OC for cell analysis.

All images are scaled relative to the 4 μm scale bar. (c) Raman
maps of the 1172/1003 cm–1 peak area ratios for

h in PBS (right). (d) Spectra acquired at the “+” annotations
in the time-dependent PBS images. The 1172 and 1003 cm–1 peaks used to generate the maps are identified at the arrows, and
the “*” annotations identify the additional 1584, 1397,
1362, and 1312 cm–1 peaks that are also associated
with reduced state cytochrome resonance enhancement. (e) Histograms
of the composite top 10 intensity values from each of the four images
in (a) and (b).

Figure 5c further demonstrates the sensitivity to
time-dependent changes on a single cell in PBS. The left image shows
the 1172/1003 cm–1 map at an early time point (approximately
1 h) after transfer to PBS, and the right image shows the same cell
approximately 2 h later. The later time-point image also shows the
characteristic “darkening” corresponding to shifting
of the cytochrome redox ratios to greater oxidized levels. Examples
of spectra acquired at similar locations (the “+” annotations)
at the different time points in Figure 5c are given in Figure 5d. The 1172 and 1003 cm–1 cytochrome
and phenylalanine peaks used to generate the normalized Raman maps
are identified along with additional cytochrome-related peaks that
indicate resonance enhancement at the 1 h time point.

Cytochromes
are involved in many redox biochemistry processes, but their primary
function is in electron transport chains for mitochondrial respiration.36 They are additionally associated with generation
of reactive oxygen species, which can play roles in signaling mechanisms,
but imbalances can lead to oxidative stress as well. These factors
have also been associated with the onset of autophagy.37 In our case, the lack of oxidizable substrates
under nutritional deprivation conditions is regarded as the primary
mechanism leading to the observed shift in cytochrome redox ratios.
Mitochondrial electron leakage will further drive the ratios to greater
oxidation.37

A Raman biomarker for
autophagy associated with a phospholipid increase has also been previously
demonstrated for mouse and human cancer cells under nutritional deprivation
over periods of 2–5 days.38 This
was thought to be related to the increased level of vesicle walls
from generation of autophagosomes. We did not detect a significant
difference in phospholipid-related peaks in our data, but this is
probably a result of the much shorter starvation timescales. Rather,
the strong differentiation of cytochrome redox ratios can be signified
as a potentially early and predictive indicator of the onset of autophagy.

Conclusions
The capacity of a higher-throughput label-free
FT-OC technology utilizing the counteraction of a radiation pressure
force, Fpr, and a drag force, Fdrag, was demonstrated by the rapid baseline
separation of a mixture of SiO2 microparticles and a mixture
of PS microparticles based on size differences. Experimentally determined
average velocities of the microparticles agreed with the calculated
values using Fpr from the Mie scattering
equation and Fdrag from the Stokes equation
at equilibrium. The sensitivity of FT-OC enabled the detection of
the responses of macrophage cells to environmental stimuli, such as
nutritional deprivation, as a decrease in the average velocity accompanied
by a small increase in the average cell size. Other changes revealed
by confocal fluorescence microscopy, AFM, and confocal Raman microspectroscopy
include cell morphological changes induced by reorganization of the
actin cytoskeleton and remodeling of the plasma membrane as well as
biochemical transformations of the cells manifested by alterations
in cytochrome redox states. The reorganization of the cytoskeleton
changed the distribution of the actin structure and altered the scattering
pattern. The remodeling of the plasma membrane displayed ruffled characteristics
that increased light scattering. The combination of all these factors
contributed to the increase in radiation pressure force exerted on
the nutrient-deprived cells, which resulted in their average velocity
being reduced. This work has demonstrated that label-free, high-throughput
FT-OC, in combination with confocal Raman microspectroscopy, holds
the potential to become a timely pathogen detection method based on
changes in the radiation pressure force experienced by innate immune
cells. The innate immune cells, such as macrophages, thus serve as
a proxy for detecting host immune responses via associated physical
and biochemical cellular changes.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Mouse peritoneal macrophage cells (IC-21) were obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA, USA) and grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5%
CO2 in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (ATCC). The cells were seeded 24–48 h prior to performing
the assays.

FT-OC System Setup
A schematic of
the FT-OC system is given in Figure 6a. The microfluidic flow cell was custom-fabricated
by Translume Inc. (Ann Arbor MI) and consisted of five layers of fused
silica plates. The side lengths of the plates are 25.4 mm with a thickness
varying from 0.5 to 1 mm. Three holes 350 μm in diameter were
drilled in one of the two cover plates to connect the liquid reservoirs
to three sheath flow channels leading to a 3D focusing nozzle (Figure 6b) constructed at
the beginning of a circular focusing channel (250 μm in diameter).
One hole, 350 μm in diameter, was drilled in the other cover
plate to connect the sample reservoir to the sample injection channel
leading toward the center of the focusing nozzle. A serpentine channel
was incorporated in the sample injection channel to entrain injected
particles/cells at low flow rates. The second circular channel (250
μm in diameter) downstream of the focusing channel served as
the interrogation region for particles/cells (Figure 6b). A custom-made plastic flow cell holder
was used to create leak-free connections between the channel inlets/outlets
and fluid connectors (Nanoport, Upchurch Scientific, Inc., Oak Harbor,
WA).

to the focusing channel and interrogation channel. (c) Working principle
of FT-OC: balancing optical force and drag force on a microparticle.

The fluid control system consisted
of five pressurized fluid reservoirs using PEEK capillaries (100 μm
in inner diameter, IDEX, Lake Forest, Illinois, U.S.A.) and fluid
connectors from IDEX. Three fluid reservoirs were used for three sheath
flows, and one was used for sample injection. The fifth reservoir
was connected to the outlet of the flow cell. Pulseless, stable, and
reproducible fluid flows were enabled by electronic pressure controllers
(OEM-EP, Parker Hannifin, Hollis, NH). Flow directions and flow rates
were controlled by in-house software developed using LabView. Flow
rates were measured to a resolution of 1.5 nL/min using multiple calibrated
liquid mass flow meters (Sensirion Inc., Palo Alto, CA).

Optics and
Imaging
A continuous-wave (CW) 1064 nm ytterbium fiber laser
(IPG Photonics, Oxford, MA) was used to impart an optical force on
the particles/cells to be analyzed. The laser beam was focused into
the interrogation channel by a 0.5 inch-in-diameter, 75 mm-in-focal
length lens from Thorlabs (Newton, NJ). The focusing and interrogation
channels were monitored using either a 10× or a 20× objective
(Mitutoyo, Kawasaki, Japan) and a lens tube system (Infinity Photo-Optical,
Boulder, CO) connected to a CCD camera (Basler, Inc. Exton, PA) illuminated
using a PL-800 fiber optic light (Edmund Optics, Barrinton, NJ). The
camera, objective, and illuminator were mounted independent of the
laser and of each other on separate xyz translation
platforms from Thorlabs. The alignment of the laser beam inside the
interrogation channel was achieved by imaging injected fluorescent
polystyrene microspheres (Fluoresbrile carboxy YO 0.2 micron, Polysciences,
Warrington, PA) that filled the channel. Beam waist (19.8 μm)
was measured after the alignment.

FT-OC Data
Collection and Analysis
Particles used were SiO2 (1.00 and 2.50 μm in diameter, Polysciences, Warrington, PA)
and PS (1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 μm in diameter, Polysciences) suspended
in DI H2O in appropriate concentrations. Live macrophage
samples were prepared as described below. The seeded cells were first
rinsed with room temperature PBS (1×) twice (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) and then were dislodged from the 6-well plate (USA Scientific,
Ocala, FL) by incubating the plate at 37 °C with 2 mL of PBS
(1×) for 5–7 min. The cells were collected and centrifuged
at 125 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded,
and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of PBS (1×), and the cell
density was determined using a hemocytometer. A cell density of 200,000
cells in 1 mL of PBS (1×) was used for the assay. For the nutrient-deprived
cells, the cells were processed similarly and were subsequently suspended
in PBS for 2 h prior to FT-OC data collection.

FT-OC was performed
by applying two opposing forces on particles/cells using a laser beam
(radiation pressure force, Fpr) and a
fluid flow (drag force, Fdrag), as shown
in Figure 6c. At a
fixed laser power, usually 3 W, an appropriate total fluid flow rate
(the sum of three sheath flows and the sample injection flow) was
chosen to ensure that the particles/cells passing through the interrogation
window were not stopped by the optical force. Particles/cells were
continuously injected into the sample channel from the sample reservoir
with a flow rate approximately 10% of the total flow rate. The sample
stream met the three sheath flows at the 3D focusing nozzle with particles/cells
confined to the center core of the flow toward the interrogation channel.
Data collection and analysis were performed using in-house software.
Briefly, a detection window (400 × 125 μm) was centered
at the focal region of the laser beam as indicated by the black box
in Figure 6c. As each
particle enters the detection window, its images were recorded by
the CCD camera (50 fps), and the x positions (parallel
to the flow direction) of these images were determined by the software.
The average particle velocity was calculated from recorded images
and their positions. The average particle size was determined by counting
the number of pixels in the images. Each day before running actual
samples, the laser alignment and the beam focal point were calibrated
by collecting a number of 3 μm PS particles (n > 100) under preset conditions. Necessary adjustments were made
to ensure the reproducibility of the average velocities and the positions
of the particles along the detection window at their slowest velocities
under the same preset conditions.

DIC and Confocal Fluorescence
Microscopy Studies of Macrophages
For DIC imaging of fixed
suspended cells, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS (1×), and
fresh PBS was added to the cells, and they were allowed to incubate
for 5–7 mins to dislodge the attached the cells. The dislodged
cells were collected and centrifuged at 125g for
5 mins. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended
in 1 mL of PBS. An equal volume (1 mL) of 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) was added to the cells. The cells were incubated for
10 mins at room temperature and then were centrifuged at 125g for 5 mins. The supernatant was discarded, and the fixed
cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of PBS before analysis. The same
protocol was followed for nutrient-deprived cells except dislodged
cells were kept in suspension in PBS for 2 h on the working bench
at room temperature prior to the fixation. The procedure of preparing
samples for DIC and confocal fluorescence imaging of fixed attached
cells are described below. Approximately 1500 cells were seeded in
the center of a FluoroDish in culture media and incubated at 37 °C
in the presence of 5% CO2 for 24 h prior to performing
the confocal staining. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with
PBS (1×) and 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
was added to the cells followed by 45 s incubation at 37 °C under
5% CO2. The cells were then rinsed twice with PBS (1×),
and 4% paraformaldehyde was added to the cells. After 20 min of incubation
at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with PBS (1×)
before adding 1% Triton-X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After
5 min, the cells were washed again, twice with PBS (1×). For
blocking, 1% BSA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was added
to the cells, and the sample was incubated at RT for 30 min before
washing twice with PBS (1×). The actin filament stain, Alex Fluor
488 Phalloidin stain (1:500) (Ex/Em: 495/518 nm, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA), was added to the cells, and the cells were incubated
in the dark for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS (1×)
and a drop of the DAPI nuclear stain (Ex/Em: 360/460 nm, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) was added onto the cells. The same protocol was followed
for nutrient-deprived cells except the cells were incubated in PBS
for 30 min prior to the fixation.

DIC images were acquired on
a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted confocal microscope with a 100× oil
objective lens (NA 1.49, Nikon). A 405 nm OBIS laser and a 488 nm
Sapphire laser (both from Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) were used to
acquire confocal fluorescence images.

AFM of Live Macrophages
Cells with a density of 750 cells/mL were seeded at the center
of a FluoroDish coated with poly-d-lysine 24 h prior to AFM
measurement. For cells used in the nutritional deprivation study,
the culture medium in the FluoroDish was replaced with PBS 30 min
prior to AFM scanning. AFM images were obtained using a NanoWizard
4a AFM (JPK Instruments AG, Berlin, Germany) mounted on an Eclipse
Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc. Melville, NY). AFM
scans are performed in the QI mode at room temperature using qp-BioAC-CB3
AFM probes (NANOSENSORS, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland).

Confocal Raman
Microspectroscopy of Macrophages
The cells were processed
using the same procedure as mentioned for OC. Cells suspended in cell
culture media or PBS in a screw cap tube (1 mL, 100,000 cells/mL)
were poured into a petri dish filled with 3 mL of the medium or PBS.
Cells were allowed to settle onto a glass coverslip at the bottom
of the dish before a water dipping objective (100×/NA 1.10, Nikon)
was immersed. Confocal Raman spectra of cells were acquired while
they were still in a spherical morphology with a Renishaw inVia Raman
upright microscope (Gloucestershire, United Kingdom) using a 514 nm
argon laser with 2400 lines/mm grating. Spectra were acquired from
530 to 1800 cm–1, and mapping step sizes were 1
μm in the x and y directions.
Raman data was processed and analyzed using WIRE 4.1 software (Renishaw).
Processing consisted of cosmic ray spike removal and principal component
noise filtering. Maps were then generated from selected Raman peak
areas. No corrections were made for cells either in media or PBS.
Using a confocal configuration and a high NA objective minimized background
contributions from media/PBS.

Radiation Pressure Calculation
Using Mie Theory
Calculations were performed utilizing a
modified code from Dave39 to obtain the
asymmetry parameter g for spherical polystyrene,
silica particles, and macrophage cells. The asymmetry parameter is
the average cosine of the laser light scattering angle. The particles
were assumed to have a real refractive index (Qabs = 0). The extinction efficiencies from the Dave code were
compared with the results from the Bohren–Huffman code40 and were in good agreement. The particles were
suspended in water (n = 1.326). The laser wavelength
was 1064 nm, and the power was 3.0 W.
