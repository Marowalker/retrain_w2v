The
palladium-on-carbon (Pd/C)-catalyzed hydrogenative deprotection
of the N-benzyl-protecting group was effectively
facilitated by the combined use of niobic acid-on-carbon (Nb2O5/C). Nb2O5/C is an acidic heterogeneous
catalyst prepared from NbCl5 and activated carbon. The
catalysts were easily removed from the reaction mixture and reusable.
Deprotected amines were obtained in excellent yields without an additional
neutralization process. The facilitating effect of Nb2O5/C was also observed during the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenative
deprotection of the N-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and O-benzyl groups.

Introduction
Protecting groups are
crucially important for the efficient synthesis
of the target molecules.1 The benzyl (Bn)
group is often utilized as a protecting group for amine functionalities,
and deprotection of the N-benzyl-protected amines
can be carried out under various reaction conditions in the presence
of a Lewis acid (e.g., BBr3,2a BCl3,2b or AlCl3 in anisole2c), Brønsted acid [e.g.,
aqueous H2SO4 and3ap-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) in toluene3b or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in toluene3c], or oxidants [e.g., Oxone,4aN-Iodosuccinimide (NIS),4b 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone
(DDQ),4c and ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate
(CAN)4d]. The Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation1 is also often used for deprotection of the N-benzyl protecting group as a green sustainable method
due to the easy removal and reuse of the catalyst. However, due to
the strong coordination ability of amines to Pd, the catalytic activity
gradually decreases depending on the extended contact time of the
amines (the substrate and product) and Pd. Therefore, high pressure
and/or high temperature are often required to complete the deprotection.5 Although the amine hydrochloride sometimes acted
as a relatively slow-acting catalyst poison,6 the addition of hydrochloric acid or acetic acid for the Pd/C-catalyzed
hydrogenative deprotection of the N-benzyl protecting
group delayed the poisoning rate of Pd/C by the formation of amine
salts to facilitate the deprotection.7 However,
a neutralization process was required to isolate the desired debenzylated
amine. By the way, niobic acid (Nb2O5) possessing
properties as both Brønsted and Lewis acids8 has attracted much attention as an acidic solid catalyst
to promote esterification,9a amidation,9b cyclic imide synthesis,9c and dehydration.9d Nb2O5/C, in which Nb2O5 was highly dispersed
on the activated carbon, is also utilized in a number of reactions,
such as photodegradation,10a,10b hydrogenation,10c and dehydration.10d,10e We have developed a novel preparation method of Nb2O5/C from NbCl5 and its application as an effective
cocatalyst for the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenative deprotection of the N-benzyl protecting group to provide the corresponding debenzylated
amine without an additional neutralization process (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Pd/C-Catalyzed Hydrogenative
Deprotection of N-Benzyl
groups
Results and Discussion
Nb2O5/C could be easily prepared from commercially
available NbCl5 and activated carbon (Scheme 2). To the suspension of activated
carbon (80 g) in deionized water (860 mL), the NbCl5 (20.5
g) was added dropwise at room temperature. [Caution: NbCl5 intensely reacted with water along with the evolution
of hydrogen chloride (HCl)]. After stirring for 1 h, the reaction
mixture was filtered to obtain 10% Nb2O5/C [total
223.7 g including water (60%)].

Scheme 2 Preparation of Nb2O5/C
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of Nb2O5/C (Figure 1) showed characteristic peaks of Nb2O5.11 X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis (Figure 2)
and scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM) images (Figure 3) of Nb2O5/C revealed
that Nb2O5 was supported in an amorphous form
on the activated carbon [the broad peaks (2θ = 22°, 43°)
in XRD were derived from carbon, and the peak derived from amorphous
Nb2O5 was not observed] and well correlated
with the literature values.8,10e Furthermore, it was
identified by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) that Nb2O5 was mainly dispersed on the surface of the activated
carbon (Figure S1).

Figure 3 STEM images of Nb2O5/C.

The addition effect of
Nb2O5/C on the Pd/C-catalyzed
deprotection of N-benzyl dioctylamine (1a; 0.2 mmol) was evaluated at room temperature in MeOH under a hydrogen
atmosphere (Figure 4). The deprotection of 1a partially proceeded by the
independent use of 1 mol % of Pd/C to give a mixture of the desired
deprotected amine (2a, 54%) and recovered 1a (40%) for 60 min (green line) and the deprotection was still incomplete
even after 90 min (turnover frequency: 60 h–1).
Meanwhile, the addition of Nb2O5/C (1 mol %)
efficiently accelerated the Pd/C-catalyzed deprotection of 1a and the deprotected amine (2a) was quantitatively obtained
within 45 min (red line; turnover number: 100, turnover frequency:
133 h–1). It is noteworthy that an analytically
pure product (2a) was isolated by only simple filtration
without further purification such as neutralization and/or extraction.
Since the reaction never proceeded without Pd/C and 1a was quantitatively recovered (yellow line), it is obvious that Nb2O5/C does not possess a catalyst activity for hydrogenation,
but effectively facilitates the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenative deprotection
of the N-benzyl protecting group.

Figure 4 Time-course study of
debenzylation using 10% Pd/C and/or 10% Nb2O5/C.

The deprotection of 1a was also completed in i-PrOH instead of MeOH within
45 min (Table 1, entry
2), while toluene and water were
inefficient solvents (entries 3 and 4). The 3 mmol scale deprotection
of 1a (1.01 g) was also applicable without any significant
loss of the catalytic activity as well (entry 5).

a 3 mmol (1.01 g) of 1a was used.

The acceleration effects on the debenzylation of Nb2O5/C and other acid catalysts were next compared
(Table 2). As noted
in Figure 4, the Pd/C-catalyzed
hydrogenative deprotection of 1a in the presence of Nb2O5/C as a catalytic additive was completed at room
temperature within 45 min (Table 2, entry 1), while the deprotection without Nb2O5 was incomplete even after 1 h and the unchanged 1a was recovered in a 40% yield (entry 3). The dried Nb2O5/C was also effective to give 1a in a quantitative yield for 45 min (entry 2). The use of Sc(OTf)3 (1 mol %), K-10 montmorillonite (10 wt %), AMBERLYST 46 (1
mol %), and phosphotungstic acid (10 wt %) additives all gave unsatisfactory
results (entries 3–6). While a remarkable promoting effect
was observed in the 1% HCl–MeOH solution as the solvent (entry
7), a significant enhancement of the deprotection was not observed
even using a 5% HCl–MeOH solvent (entry 8). These results clearly
exhibited the utility of Nb2O5/C toward the
acceleration of the Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenative debenzylation.

The scope of
substrates for the Pd/C and Nb2O5/C-combined
debenzylation reaction was next investigated (Table 3). The benzyl-protected N-alkylaniline as secondary amines (1b and 1c) smoothly underwent the present hydrogenative deprotection
to give the secondary amine derivatives (2b and 2c; entries 1 and 2), and N-benzylaniline
(1d) and N,N-dibenzylaniline
(1e) were also effectively deprotected and the corresponding
anilines (2d) were both obtained in excellent yields
(entries 3 and 4). The benzyl-protected primary aliphatic amines (1f and 1g) and cyclic amine (1h)
were also quantitatively deprotected (entries 5, 7, and 8). While
the benzyl amines connected to N-heterocycles, such
as pyridine (1i) and pyrimidine (1j), were
entirely inactive against the present deprotection reaction conditions
(entries 10 and 11), N-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-2-(pyrimidyl)amine
(1k) was efficiently deprotected to give 2j in a 97% yield within 1 h (entry 12). The N-Cbz-protected
dioctylamine (1l) was smoothly converted to 2a as a secondary aliphatic amine in an excellent yield (entry 14).
In addition, the O-benzyl-protected phenol (1m) and ethylene glycol (1n) were also rapidly
deprotected using a mixture of Pd/C and Nb2O5/C (entries 15 and 17). It is noteworthy that the remarkable accelerating
effect of Nb2O5/C was observed for all of the
Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenative deprotections of the N-Bn-protected amines (1f and 1h) as well
as the N-Cbz-protected amine (1k) and O-Bn-protected phenol (1m) (entries 5 vs 6,
8 vs 9, 12 vs 13, and 15 vs 16). The present debenzylation of N-Bn (1o) and O-Bn (1p) protecting groups could effectively proceed without the
cleavage of the coexisting tert-butyldimethylsilyl
(TBS) ether (entries 18 and 19). The acceleration effect of Nb2O5/C was also observed (entries 19 vs 20). The
use of HCl as a traditional accelerator7 caused the deprotection of O-Bn as well as O-TBS protecting groups (entry 21), which clearly indicated
the advantage of the use of Nb2O5/C. The mixed
catalyst of Pd/C and Nb2O5/C was also adaptable
to the hydrogenative reduction of alkene, epoxide, aryl chloride,
azide, nitro, and benzyl alcohol functionalities to give the corresponding
reduced products (Table S1).

c 48% of the substrate was recovered.

d The yield was determined by 1H NMR using 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene as an internal standard.

e 5% HCl–MeOH solution

used as a solvent.

The mixture
of 10% Pd/C and 10% Nb2O5/C could
be reused at least three times without any significant loss in the
catalytic activity (Table 4). It has also been confirmed that the oxidation state of
Nb2O5 did not change before and after the reactions
(Figure 5; XPS results).
It was revealed that palladium as a particle and Nb2O5 as an amorphous individually existed after the reaction by
STEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) spectra
(Figure 6). Furthermore,
the particle size of Pd was found not to be changed before and after
the reaction (Figure S4). Although catalyst
activities slightly decreased in the fourth and fifth runs, the acceleration
effect was still observed in comparison with the reaction using an
independent Pd/C. During the present deprotection, the leaching of
Pd (<0.1 ppm) and Nb species (<1.0 ppm) was hardly detected
by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
analysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS).

Conclusions
We have newly demonstrated that Nb2O5/C significantly
facilitated the Pd/C-catalyzed deprotection of the N-benzyl protecting groups under a hydrogen atmosphere. Nb2O5/C was easily prepared from NbCl5 and activated
carbon and removed by simple filtration from the reaction mixture.
The deprotected product could be simply isolated without further neutralization
or extraction. The N-Cbz- and O-Bn-protected
groups were also smoothly deprotected under the Pd/C and Nb2O5/C-combined hydrogenation conditions for a much shorter
reaction time in comparison to the deprotection by the single use
of Pd/C. Nb2O5/C is useful as a heterogeneous
and reusable acidic catalyst from the viewpoint of green and process
chemistry.

Typical Procedures
in Pd/C- and Nb2O5/C-Catalyzed
Hydrogenative Deprotection
Typical Procedure A

mg, 0.002 mmol) or
a mixture of 10% Pd/C and 10% Nb2O5/C (including
60% water, 17.3 mg, 0.002 mmol) was added to a solution of benzyl-
or Cbz-protected substrate (1: 0.2 mmol) in MeOH (1 mL).
The inside air was replaced with H2 (balloon) by three
vacuum/H2 cycles. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature until the thin layer chromatography (TLC) monitoring indicated
the complete consumption of the starting material. Then, the reaction
mixture was passed through a Celite pad or membrane filter using EtOAc
to remove Pd/C and Nb2O5/C. The filtrate was
concentrated in vacuo to give deprotected product (2).

Typical Procedure B
10% Pd/C (2.1 mg, 0.002 mmol) or
a mixture of 10% Pd/C and 10% Nb2O5/C (including
60% water, 17.3 mg, 0.002 mmol) was added to a solution of benzyl-
or Cbz-protected substrate (1: 0.2 mmol) in CD3OD (1 mL). The inside air was replaced with H2 (balloon)
by three vacuum/H2 cycles. The reaction mixture was stirred
at room temperature until the TLC monitoring indicated the complete
consumption of the starting material. Then, 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene
was added as an internal standard and the reaction mixture was passed
through a membrane filter to remove Pd/C and Nb2O5/C. The yield of 2 was determined by 1H NMR
using 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene (20.5 μL, 0.2 mmol) as an internal
standard.
