Hypervalent tellurium
compounds (telluranes) are promising therapeutical agents with negligible
toxicities for some diseases in animal models. The C–Te bond
of organotellurium compounds is commonly considered unstable, disfavoring
their applicability in biological studies. In this study, the stability
of a set of telluranes composed of an inorganic derivative and noncharged
and charged organic derivatives was monitored in aqueous media with 1H, 13C, and 125Te NMR spectroscopy and
high-resolution mass spectrometry. Organic telluranes were found to
be remarkably resistant and stable to hydrolysis, whereas the inorganic
tellurane AS101 is totally converted to the hydrolysis
product, trichlorooxytellurate, [TeOCl3]−, which was also observed in the hydrolysis
of TeCl4. The noteworthy stability
of organotelluranes in aqueous media makes them prone to further structure–activity
relationship studies and to be considered for broad biological investigations.

==== Body
Introduction
Tellurium is a rare
element narrowly studied in a biological context.
A general belief that all its compounds are toxic impairs interest
in further exploring their biological activities and applications
in therapy. Although toxicity data of elemental tellurium, tellurite,
and tellurate are known,1 only a few organic
tellurides and ditellurides were studied in this context.2 In contrast to this, there are therapeutically
promising examples of inorganic and organic tellurium compounds showing
reduced toxicity and potent activities in both in vitro and in vivo models.2−4 The most studied tellurium-containing
compound is the inorganic tellurane named AS101, an ammonium
tellurate, which presents immunomodulatory action3 and was found to be active in preclinical and clinical
studies.4 In addition to the known cellular
pathways modulated by AS101, the high affinity of the
hypervalent tellurium atom with thiols consists the molecular basis
of its effects. This affinity was demonstrated by NMR studies of AS101 with cysteine and in the inhibition of cysteine-based
proteases (papain and pig spleen cathepsin B) by Albeck and co-workers
in 1998.5 In the following, we have shown
that organic derivatives of tellurium(IV), having ligands prone to
exchange-type reactions, were very potent inhibitors of recombinant
human cathepsin B, up to 40-fold in the relative second-order Cat.B
inhibition rate constants (ki/Ki) compared to AS101.6 After that, the inhibitions of recombinant human
cathepsins B, L, S, and K were determined for an expanded set of diverse
organotelluranes, including the inorganic derivatives AS101, a brominated AS101 derivative, and benzyltriethylammonium
hexachlorotellurate.7 These studies have
shown that the inhibition potency is modulated by the organic moieties
and by the exchangeable ligands bonded to the tellurium atom. The
influence of halides (chloride and bromide) on the inhibition of cathepsins
V and S for a structurally related set of organotelluranes showed
that the bromides were always more reactive than the chlorides because
they led to higher ki/Ki values, and the corresponding selenuranes were less
reactive than the tellurium homologues but showed the same trend as
the halides.8 It was found that organotelluranes
are able to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases,9 the β2 site of proteasome (trypsin-like activity),10 to promote the intracellular proteolysis in Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites,11 to impair the bioenergetics of mitochondria elicited by
thiol consumption, and to induce the assembly and opening of mitochondrial
permeability transition pore12 and, like AS101, have shown negligible toxicity for animal models so
far. Additional activities include in vitro antiviral,13 antitumoral,14 and
the in vivo protection of rats in pilocarpine-induced
epilepsy,15 as well as antileishmanial
action in animal models of cutaneous16 and
visceral leishmaniasis.17

The particular
reactivity of telluranes with thiols was previously
studied for a few examples of both inorganic and organic derivatives
in model reactions. Thiol consumption in such reactions was followed
by colorimetric assays5−7 and by 125Te NMR spectroscopy,6,10,18 as changes in chromophores or
in the observed tellurium species involved giving insights about ongoing
processes. As telluranes have been shown to be promising potential
therapeutical agents,2−4,11−17 a primary concern consists in their behavior, including stability
in aqueous media because hydrolytic products can exhibit distinct
reactivity profiles for bionucleophiles. Recently, it has been shown
that AS101 (1) is hydrolyzed forming a triclorooxytellurate
(2), which is suggested to be the actual inorganic tellurane
involved in AS101 bioactivities (Scheme 1).19 The stabilities
of two organotelluranes in a buffered medium were monitored by NMR
spectroscopy, and both dichloride 3a and dibromide 3b were converted to the corresponding telluroxide 4 above 60 and 70 °C, respectively, suggesting that those derivatives
are very stable in an aqueous environment (Scheme 1).20

Scheme 1 Reported

Telluranes (B) in Aqueous Media to Hydrolysis Products
and Their 125Te Chemical Shifts
These reports stimulated us to share our results on the
stabilities
of a set of telluranes depicted in Chart 1. This collection has two telluranes (8a and 8b) with a hydroxyl group, which is coordinated
to tellurium, another tellurane 8c that lacks a strong
intramolecular n-donor group, the ammonium(oxo)trichlorotellurate AS101 (1) and the ammonium tetrachloaryltellurate 7. A systematic study was performed varying the tellurane,
the nature of the solvent, and reaction temperature. All experiments
were monitored by 1H, 13C, and 125Te NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

Chart 1 Structures of Studied
Telluranes
Results and Discussion
The organotelluranes
were prepared by electrophilic addition reactions
of tellurium tetrachloride 5, under microwave irradiation,
to the corresponding alkynes or anisole.21 Tellurium tetrachloride was prepared by an improved reaction under
microwave irradiation using elemental tellurium and sulfuryl chloride.22AS101 (1) was prepared
by refluxing a suspension of tellurium tetrachloride and an equimolar
amount of ethylene glycol in acetonitrile.23 Tellurium tetrachloride was submitted to reaction with anisole under
microwave irradiation to furnish p-methoxyphenyltellurium
trichloride (6),24 the starting
material of the organic telluranes. The trichloride 6 was treated with aqueous hydrogen chloride solution (6 mol/L) followed
by reaction with aqueous ammonium chloride to provide ammonium (p-methoxyphenyl)tetrachlorotellurate (7) in
93% yield.25 Finally, the remaining organotelluranes
were prepared by the electrophilic addition reactions of trichloride 6 to the appropriated alkynes under microwave irradiation
(Scheme 2).21

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Telluranes 8a–c, Tellurate 7, and AS101
With compounds 5–8 and AS101 in
hand, we performed a systematic study of their stabilities in organic
solvents in the absence and the presence of water. Initially, AS101 was evaluated in aqueous and alcoholic solutions, as
previously described by Silberman and co-workers.19 A 0.44 mol/L dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 solution of AS101 was treated with successive
additions of D2O, and 5 min after each addition, the corresponding 125Te NMR spectra were recorded. Thus, as 2 equiv of D2O were added, two species were detected resonating at 1680
and 1520 ppm, relative to AS101 and a hydrolysis product,
[TeOCl3]−,
respectively. After this, 10 equiv of D2O were added to
the same tube and the signals at 1680 and 1520 ppm were attenuated,
whereas a new specie resonating at 1650 ppm appeared. In a control
experiment,
a DMSO-d6 solution of TeCl4 (0.44 mol/L) treated with 1 equiv of deuterated
water led to a tellurium specie, which resonated at 1520 ppm, similarly
to what was observed for AS101 solution strongly supporting
the presence of [TeOCl3]− (Figure 1).

Figure 1 (1) 125Te NMR spectrum of AS101 in DMSO-d6. (2) 125Te NMR spectrum of AS101 in DMSO-d6 and 2 equiv of
D2O. (3) 125Te NMR spectrum of AS101 in DMSO-d6 and 10 equiv of D2O. (4) 125Te NMR spectrum of TeCl4 in DMSO-d6 and 1 equiv

The characterization
of these species was further done by high-resolution
mass spectrometry-electrospray ionization (HRMS-ESI-(-)) analyses,
where AS101, [TeOCl3]−, and a chlorotellurinic acid, [HTeClO2]−, were detected in the
solution treated with 2 equiv of water (Figure 2A). Other hydrolysis products were detected
when the amount of added water reached 100 equiv, which led to the
formation of [HTeO2]− as a majority specie (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 HRMS-ESI-(-) spectra of AS101 after treated with (A)
2 equiv and (B) 100 equiv of water.

The hydrolytic profile of AS101 observed by
us is
in accordance with that reported by Silberman and co-workers.19 The ligand-exchange processes of AS101 were further studied using propylene glycol and ethanol. The reaction
of AS101 with propylene glycol led to a rapid formation
of a major specie, resonating at 1690 ppm, resulting from the transacetalization
of AS101 to the propylene glycol analogue, as confirmed
by the HSMS-ESI-(-) spectrum (Figure S1).

The reaction of AS101 with ethanol was checked
by
HRMS-ESI-(-), where a mixture of AS101 hydrolysis products,
[HTeClO2]− and
[TeOCl3]−, AS101, and ethoxytetrachlorotellurate, [EtOTeCl4]−, were observed (Figure S2).

To this solution, after the
addition of 100 equiv of water, the
total consumption of AS101 as the monoethoxylated tellurate
was suppressed, leading to the same mixture observed by AS101 hydrolysis (Figure S6). Although this
set of experiments supports the instability of inorganic telluranes,
which are prone to rapid hydrolysis and ligand-exchange reactions,
the biological effects of AS101 and the reactivity of
tellurium toward thiols and related processes are still devoid of
clarification.

At this point, we moved our attention to the
stability of the organotelluranes
starting with the ammonium tetrachloroaryl tellurate (7) that exhibited a surprising stability in comparison to AS101 under identical conditions. The 125Te NMR spectrum of 4 in DMSO-d6 shows a signal at
1241 ppm relative to the reference signal of PhTeTePh. The successive
addition of 25% in volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
did not change the HRMS-ESI-(-) and 125Te NMR spectra even
after 30 days at 25 °C (Figure 3). The successive addition of D2O to the
DMSO-d6 solution of 7 in
a separate experiment also did not furnish any new specie. These results
evidence the higher stability of the tellurate 7 toward
hydrolysis relative to AS101.

The neutral organotelluranes 8a–c were then
studied to check their stability toward an aqueous environment. A
control experiment consisting in a DMSO-d6 (0.26 mol/L) solution of 8a and D2O solution
of 8a (90:10 v/v) has been maintained on the lab bench,
and 1H, 13C, and 125Te NMR spectra
were recorded for over 2 years, showing no extent of decomposition
and hydrolysis. This astounding result encouraged us to carry out
further experiments with organotelluranes 8a–c monitoring possible hydrolysis reactions. All experiments were performed
in NMR tubes containing 0.25 mol/L solutions of compounds 8a–c in a DMSO-d6/D2O (90:10)
mixture using diphenylditelluride as an external reference. NMR spectra
were recorded in the course of 30 days (initially on a daily basis
for 1 week and on a weekly basis for 1 month). As shown in the 125Te NMR spectra, the telluranes 8a–c were
remarkably stable toward hydrolysis in these solutions (Figures 4–6).

mixture.

mixture.

In addition to that, the organotellurane 8a was held
in a DMSO-d6/PBS buffer (pH 7.4) mixture
and monitored over the course of 4 days varying the incubation temperatures
in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, the solution
was maintained at 25 °C for 2 h (Figure 7A); in the second experiment, the solution
was incubated at 40 °C for 48 h (Figure 7B). Finally, the solution was incubated at
40 °C for 96 h (Figure 7C). In all cases, the organotellurane 8a remained
intact.

Figure 7 125Te NMR spectrum of 8a in a DMSO-d6/PBS buffer (pH 7.4) mixture at (A) 25 °C
after 2 h, (B) 40 °C after 48 h, and (C) 40 °C after 96
h.

In a further experiment, the stability
of compound 8a was checked in acidic media. In a 5 mm
NMR tube, 50 mg of compound 8a was diluted in a mixture
of DMSO-d6 (300 μL) and HCl (30
μL, 6 mol/L), the solution
was maintained at 25 °C for 24 h, and after that time, compound 8a did not show any transformation. The same behavior was
observed in a less acidic medium composed of a mixture of DMSO-d6 and buffered acetate solution (pH 5.5). As
telluranes react with bases in known reactions of diorganyl tellurium
dichlorides, which are converted into dihydroxides26 or oxides,27 their stability
in basic media is therefore worrying. Nevertheless, organotellurane 8a did not resist when
challenged in concentrated basic media using sodium hydroxide (pH
12) it showed a remarkable persistence at pH 8.0 (sodium phosphate
buffer) that was monitored for 6 days at room temperature.

Taken
together, our data demonstrate a striking difference in the
stabilities of inorganic and organic telluranes. As inorganic telluranes
are promptly converted to other species eliminating their ligands,
the organic moieties of organotelluranes are remarkably persistent
in aqueous environments. In an attempt to gain insight into these
differences, we performed density functional theory calculations.
The Gibbs free energies, collected in Scheme S1 (see Supporting Information), were used
to evaluate the relative stability of the compounds AS101, 7, and 8b against hydrolysis. The computed
thermochemistry indicates that AS101 undergoes hydrolysis
more easily than compounds 7 and 8b because
it showed to be less stable than the other compounds by ∼4
kcal/mol. Also, the charge distributions in these molecules were obtained
using the Natural Population Analysis (NPA) model (Table S1). In agreement with the behavior observed in the
thermochemistry results, the NPA charges indicate that the higher
negative charges were observed on the ethylene glycol’s oxygen
atoms in AS101. The NPA showed that tellurium atom presents
the larger positive charges of +1.894 for AS101 and +1.450
and +1.565 for telluranes 7 and 8b, respectively.
These differences point to a more electrophilic character of AS101’s
tellurium atom than in the organic derivatives that suffer a nucleophilic
attack of water followed by the protonation of alkoxide in a stepwise
mechanism yielding the [TeOCl3]− specie.

Also, the superior stability of organotelluranes combined
with
a higher reactivity for biological thiols7 may explain in part the high biological activities but might raise
concerns about their clearance from the body. The mechanisms of organotellurium
metabolization are not yet clear as for elemental tellurium and tellurite
in plants and some microorganisms. In this direction, further pharmacokinetics
studies are currently under way to clarify this point. On the other
hand, the higher stability of tellurium organic derivatives
prompts their structure–activity relationship studies due to
the persistence of the organic moieties bonded to tellurium.
