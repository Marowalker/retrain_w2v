MoOx quantum dots were inserted between
the Si nanowires (SiNWs) and Cu contacts to form the MoOx/SiNW heterojunctions via the low-temperature solution
process. The common Schottky heterojunction of Cu/SiNWs is used as
the referred device, and the photoelectric characteristics of Cu/MoOx/Si structures are detailedly investigated.
The results indicate that the inset of MoOx between Cu and SiNWs obviously enhances photoelectric conversion
efficiency from 1.58 to 3.92%, and photodetection characteristics
have also improved compared to the referred device. We attribute these
experimental findings to the fact that the incorporation of MoOx quantum dots into the Cu/Si heterojunction
could enhance the transport of holes and inhibit the injection of
electrons from Si into the top Cu electrode. In addition, it is believed
that such an improved performance also comes from the improved optical
absorption as well as the optimized carrier transfer and collection
capability of MoOx/SiNW radial heterojunctions.

Introduction
One-dimensional (1D) vertically standing
Si nanowires (SiNWs) arise
as the more interesting topic due to the strong light-trapping behavior,1,2 the large interface area, and the fast charge transport by shortening
the carriers’ traveled paths, which would result in the high
efficiency of charge collection.1,3,4 Up to now, plenty of SiNW Schottky photoelectronic devices have
been reported.5−8 However, many photoelectronic devices need the minority carriers
of photogeneration to work,9 such as photovoltaic
devices and self-powered photodetectors, which could work with no
need to consume external power under a nominal zero bias volt.10 Thus, even only a Schottky barrier between n-Si
and the metal could not meet this requirement.

To eliminate
the obstacles faced with Schottky junctions, metal
oxides like cupric oxide (CuO) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) have successfully been used as hole-transporting
layers.10,11 In addition, these metal oxide layers possess
the ability to protect against moisture and O2 in the device’s
working environment.12,13 Among metal oxides, MoOx with the wide optical bandgap of ∼3.2
eV and adjustable work function from 5.8 to 6.9 eV hence could perfectly
take the place of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) in conventional organic thin-film solar cells as the hole-selective
layer.10,14

Recently, MoOx has been used as the
hole-selective contact to n-type silicon by thermal evaporation.15,16 It is well known that the cost of vacuum technology is likely to
be high compared with low-cost solution processing. To our surprise,
solution processing MoOx as a hole-transporting
layer of the Si active layer has not yet been employed. In particular,
there are few reports on photoelectronic applications of MoOx in radial SiNWs heterojunctions. Here, we introduce
first MoOx quantum dots via aqueous solution
processing to n-type SiNWs to form the shell layer of radial heterojunctions
for photovoltage and self-powered photodetection. The results demonstrate
that the device based on core-shell-structured MoOx/SiNWs exhibits an enhanced photovoltaic performance and
self-powered photodetecting behaviors compared with Cu/SiNW or MoOx/Si planar Schottky junctions. The thin quantum
dot film of MoOx is inserted between Si
and the Cu anode contact, which promotes the extraction of holes from
the n-type Si active layer. Furthermore, in comparison with the MoOx/planar silicon device, the radial junction
of MoOx/SiNWs could achieve low reflectivity
and offer a large interfacial area. These are beneficial to high light
absorption as well as efficiently separating and transporting charges.

Results
and Discussion
The size of the quantum is approximately 5
nm shown as Figure 1a. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the quantum clearly
shows the atomic planes with a lattice spacing of 2.2 Å (the
top-right inset in Figure 1a). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
reveals spots along with bright rings (the bottom-right inset in Figure 1a) and is consistent
with the polycrystalline nature of the MoOx film. Together with Figure 1a, this confirms that the s-MoOx film is nanocrystalline in nature.

MoOx quantum dots (Mo 3d core level).
(c) UPS spectra of MoOx quantum dots;

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to confirm
the main component of the MoOx film fabricated
via aqueous solution processing (shown in Figure 1b), and XPS analysis of the MoOx layer shows that the Mo atoms are mainly in the
Mo6+ oxidation state (Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks at 232.2 and 235.4 eV, respectively), which coincides
with the characteristic peak of molybdenum. The ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS) measurement of MoOx (air-exposed) is carried out and is shown in Figure 1c, the secondary electron cutoff is at 16.2
eV, the photoelectron energy of the resonance lamp is 21.2 eV, and
therefore, the work function of MoOx is
5.0 eV (21.2–16.2 eV), which is lower than the PEDOT:PSS value
(4.9 eV).17 Nevertheless, the result is
consistent with the previously reported value, and the work function
remains high to bring the Fermi level of MoOx close to the position of the valence band maximum of silicon located
at 5.12 eV;14 thus, the MoOx film can be used as a hole-transporting layer for
a MoOx/silicon solar cell.16,18

The morphologies of SiNWs and MoOx/SiNWs
are investigated. Figure 2a clearly shows the vertically aligned SiNWs. The SiNWs are
evenly distributed in mass, and their average lengths are approximately
5 um. The formation mechanism of nanowires has been confirmed by another
report.19

image of MoOx/SiNWs. (c) TEM image of
MoOx/SiNW core-shell. (d) HRTEM image
of the circled part in (c).

Figure 2b
shows
SEM images of MoOx-coated SiNWs. Morphological
changes of the SiNWs upon MoOx coating
can be seen obviously: the diameter increases, and the surface significantly
roughens. The MoOx phase has a slight
difference compared to the Si one under SEM. The TEM image in Figure 2c shows that the
shell of the coaxial structure is approximately 10 nm thick. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image clearly shows the pristine
MoOx quantum dot with a lattice spacing
(Figure 2d).

To further improve the efficiency of the Si solar cell and photodetecting
performance, we propose to use SiNWs in replacing planar silicon.
The heterojunctions were fabricated by coating MoOx films on n-type SiNWs then a semitransparent Cu nanofilm
was thermally evaporated with an approximately 10 nm thickness. The
schematic diagram of the device structure is shown in Figure 3a. Under illumination, the
Cu/SiNW/MoOx device shows the obvious
photovoltaic performance. As shown in Figure 3c, a typical device of the Cu/MoOx/SiNW cell shows a η of 3.19% with the
open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.259 V,
the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.83 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 30%. The Voc and Jsc are all
higher than those of Cu/MoOx/planar Si
and Cu/SiNW devices. Therefore, the efficiency is the best among the
three types of devices, and their J–V parameters under light are shown in Table 1.

a) Cu/MoOx/SiNWs and (b) Cu/SiNWs; J−V curves of device structures

Table 1 Photovoltaic Parameters of Different
Device Structures
device type	Voc (V)	J (mA/cm–2)	FF (%)	PCE (%)	
Cu/MoOx/Si	0.12	0.805	5.2	0.50	
Cu/MoOx/SiNWs	0.259	12.83	30	3.19	
Cu/SiNWs	0.08	0.152	2.8	0.03	
In order to further investigate the origin of the improved performance,
the characteristics of the device of Cu/SiNWs without a MoOx interlayer have been probed. In this case,
this geometry of the heterojunction diode avoids the interference
from MoOx then the Schottky junction of
Cu/SiNWs dominates the device performance. Another significant change
in the device photovoltaic behavior is observed and shown in Figure 3a,b. The inferior
photovoltaic performance had a PCE of only 0.58%. Specifically, the Voc and Jsc as well
as FF are much smaller than those of Cu/MoOx/SiNW devices. Particularly, the Voc changes
from 0.08 V without MoOx to 0.259 V with
MoOx, the obvious change of Voc reflects the ∼0.25 V increase upon the insertion
of MoOx between the SiNWs and Cu interface,
and the results provide further evidence that the MoOx interfacial layer plays the role in improving the
junction barrier. It is well known that the depth of the junction
affects the photovoltaic performance, and we speculate that the thickness
of MoOx would also affect the characteristics
of the Cu/MoOx/SiNW device. The J–V curves of the device for the
different coating layers of MoOx are shown
in Figure 4b, Voc increases with increasing number of coating
layers of MoOx from one layer to three
layers, but Jsc and FF all reduce with
increasing number of coating layers of MoOx. The results indicate that the insertion of MoOx could seperate the photogenerating carriers. However, the
prepared MoOx by solution processing possesses
a large resistance, which could lower the photogenerated carrier transport.
Therefore, the conductivity of MoOx and
the contact resistance would be regulated in our future work.

Figure 4 (a) Reflection
of SiNWs, MoOx/SiNWs,
and MoOx/Si; (b) J–V curves of the insertion of different number of layers
on the MoOx device.

In fact, the improvement of photovoltaic performance is partially
proven by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements shown in Figure 3d, and the device
Cu/MoOx/SiNW shows the best value among
the three types of devices over a wide wavelength range from 400 to
1100 nm, whereas Si planar/MoOx devices
have the smallest value at the corresponding range of wavelength.
However, our result is not better than the photovoltaic performance
of the MoOx/Si heterojunction via the
thermal evaporating method in the previous report.16 From EQE (60%) results, we could see that the collecting
efficiency of photogenerated carriers is not the best for the three
types of devices. The reason is likely to be due to the contact loss
of the semitransparent Cu anode.

Furthermore, the results implicate
that the SiNWs play the positive
role in improving the photovoltaic performance. It is easily understood
that the effective junction area of the SiNW/MoOx structure is larger than that of the Si planar/MoOx structure due to the nanostructures of the
SiNW arrays. The enhanced performances could be mainly ascribed to
the following two reasons. First, the three-dimensional core-shell
structures of the SiNWs/MoOx could provide
fast and direct pathways, which can shorten the distance of charge
carrier transport and collection. Second, the SiNWs can improve light
harvesting by suppressing the reflection of the junction surface in
the visible region compared to planar Si shown in Figure 4a, and more incident sunlight
will be absorbed into SiNWs, resulting in more photogenerated electron–hole
pairs.

In addition, based on the ln I–V curves (inset in Figure 5a), the ideality factors in the low-voltage region
(V < 0.3–0.5 V) can be estimated to be n1 = 2.77 for the MoOx/SiNW junctions and n2 = 3.2 for the
Cu/SiNW junctions as shown in Table 2. The ideality factors are high. It is well known that
a low FF and Voc originate from high ideality
factors.

voltage (Jph–Veff) characteristics of devices with MoOx and without MoOx.

parameters	Cu/Si	MoOx/Si planar	MoOx/SiNWs	
Js	462.6	13.86	2.99	
n	9.6	3.2	2.77	
Figure 5b shows
the net photocurrent (Jph = JL – JD) dependence
on the effective applied voltage (Veff = V – Vo) where JL is the current density under illumination
and JD corresponds to that in the dark, V is the applied voltage, and Vo is the compensation voltage at which Jph = 0. Noticeably, at Veff = 1.2 V, Jph reaches saturation for both devices. However,
the Jph of the Cu/MoOx/SiNW device is reached earlier than that of the device
Cu/SiNWs.

Here, all results indicate that the MoOx quantum dot (QD) film plays an important role in
the improvement
of photovoltaic performance. The heterojunctions of MoOx/Si prevent the formation of the Schottky junction
of Cu/Si, which would lead to inferior photovoltaic performances due
to the high recombination rate and large current leakage (Js). In order to prove our inference about the
role of the heterojunction of MoOx/Si,
the thickness of the MoOx QD film was
regulated by the increasing number of spin-coated layers. The J–V measurements are shown in Figure 4b, and we can see
that the Voc increases as the number of
layers increases, but the FF and Jsc all
decrease as the number of layers increases. It is obvious that the
thickness of the MoOx QD film increases
as the layer number increases, and the increase of layer number could
form continuous MoOx QD films, reducing
the contact between Cu and Si. Therefore, the MoOx QD film plays an important role on the improvement of photovoltaic
performance.

The energy band diagram of the device with the
structure of Cu/MoOx/Si/Al is shown in Figure 6a. The work function
values of Si, MoOx, Cu, and Al are referenced
from the previous
literature. The Schottky nature of an electrical contact is an intrinsic
property of the interface, but for the Si/Cu Schottky junction, the photogenerated electrons could also inject into the
Cu electrode due to the energy offsetting as shown in Figure 6b that does not arise from
an asymmetrical blocking of photogenerated electrons. For the application
in a photovoltaic device, the relatively low FF can be ascribed to
the high recombination rate arising from the symmetry energy of Cu/Si
where the MoOx layer is absent from the
device. Therefore, the high work function of MoOx as a hole-injection layer is utilized as shown in Figure 6c, and the formation
of the Schottky junction is inhibited by the insertion of a thin film
of MoOx between the SiNW array layer and
Cu contact. Upon light irradiation, electron–hole pairs generated
in Si would diffuse to the MoOx/SiNW interface
and then be separated by the strong built-in electric field. Electrons
in the conduction band of Si were preferentially collected by the
bottom Al electrode, while injection of electrons from the SiNWs to
the top Cu electrode was prevented by the MoOx layer due to the large EC offset.

the Si/MoOx heterojunction in the photovoltaic
device. Band energies are given in eV and are taken from the literature.
Illumination under normal operation is incident from the MoOx side. (b) Proposed band bending in the MoOx-free-device Schottky contact of Si/Cu, (c)
inserting MoOx between Si and the anode
material.

On the other hand, holes were
readily injected into the HOMO level
of MoOx and collected by the Cu electrode.
This process results in the generation of photocurrent. In this device,
the thin film of MoOx is both a hole-transporting
layer and a physical buffer layer in the photovoltaic device. Therefore,
the insertion of MoOx could effectively
improve the device photovoltaic performance between the Si photoactive
layer and Cu contact.

Furthermore, the heterojunctions of MoOx/SiNWs and MoOx/Si
planar have been applied
for photodetectors illuminated by a laser (473 nm) under zero bias.
It is obvious that the photocurrent of the Cu/MoOx/SiNW device is larger than that of the Cu/MoOx/Si planar device shown in Figure 7a, and Figure 7 is the magnified photoresponse curve. The rise time
and fall time of photocurrent are estimated to be 20 and 40 ms, respectively.
The current–time curve within rising and decay times τd can be well fitted by the exponential expression I = I0e–t/τd. The rising and decay times τd were estimated to
be 26 and 43 ms, respectively, for the Cu/SiNW device. The generation
and recovery mechanisms of the Cu/MoOx/SiNW photodetector are different from those of the Cu/SiNW photodetector,
which forms the physical basis of excellent photocurrent recovery
behavior of Cu/MoOx/SiNWs.

and off; the light wavelengths are 473 nm. (b) Rising and falling
edges for estimated rise time and fall time; the red line is a linear
fit of the rising and falling edges of the current after illumination
is chopped off.

The photoelectrical response
of the heterojunction is dominated
by the drift time of carriers inside the depletion area of the junction.20 Therefore, the results further prove that the
MoOx interlayer prevents hole–electron
recombination or facilitates the carrier transport. The improved photovoltaic
and photodetecting performances could be attributed to the three-dimensional
core-shell geometry of MoOx/SiNWs, which
can quicken the separation and facilitate the effective collection
of the photogenerated carriers within a small distance. The asymmetric
metal–semiconductor–metal structure could enhance the
carrier separation and transport, and the similar structure had been
utilized for self-powered flexible optoelectronic devices.21

Conclusions
In summary, the heterojunctions
of MoOx/SiNWs core/shell were constructed
and fabricated by solution processing
then their photovoltaic and photodetecting characteristics were investigated.
The results showed that the inset of MoOx between Cu and SiNWs could hamper the formation of the Schottky
junction of Cu/Si and could improve the performance of photovoltaic
and photoelectric detection. In addition, the core/shell heterojunction
configuration compared to the planar structure is beneficial to transporting
and reducing the recombination of the charges, resulting from the
short transport distance. Therefore, the MoOx/SiNWs core/shell heterojunctions exhibited a reduced reverse saturation
current density and a low ideality factor. These improved photovoltaic
and photodetecting properties resulted from not only the insertion
of MoOx but also the configuration of
the core–shell MoOx/SiNW structure.
Our research proposes an effective method for improving the photoelectric
characteristics of Cu/SiNW heterojunctions, that is, the inset of
MoOx between Cu and Si based on low-cost
solution processes.

Experiments
Metal molybdenum powder
(0.2 g) was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol
and 0.7 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30%) in an ultrasonic bath (the detailed
MoOx processing was referred to in a previous
report).22−24 Then, MoOx was dissolved
into deionized water at the concentration (wt %) of 0.08%.

The
vertically aligned n-Si nanowires (NWs) are fabricated on the
n-type Si substrate by electroless chemical etching. The n-type Si
substrates were purchased from a commercial corporation. The electroless
chemical etching of Si and Ag is the new fabricating process based
on numerous nano-sized electrochemical cells, which could be self-assembled
on the surface of the silicon wafer. The detailed processing was referred
to in a previously reported method.19 Prior
to device fabrication, the cleaning procedure was performed. The silicon
wafers with NWs were ultrasonically vibrated in acetone and ethanol
at room temperature for 10 min to remove organic contaminations. The
etched time of the Si wafer and detailed process were reported in
our previous work.25

Subsequently,
the MoOx solution was
spin-cast on the dried SiNWs. In order to obtain the uniform MoOx film, first, the slow spinning speed was at
500 rpm for 15 s and then the fast speed was at 6000 rpm for 45 s,
MoOx was uniformly coated on the surface
of SiNWs, and MoOx/SiNW core/shell radial
junctions were formed. In addition, the presence of an interfacial
layer in a Schottky junction could affect the characteristics of the
device,26 and
therefore, the referenced device with SiNW/Cu was also coated with
the aqueous solution and then dried in air. The device processing
and characterization methods are the same as those in the previous
work.25 The 100 nm-thick Al film was deposited
as the cathode contact by thermal evaporation.
