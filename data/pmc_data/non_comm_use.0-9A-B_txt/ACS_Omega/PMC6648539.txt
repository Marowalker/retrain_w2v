Many studies have investigated natural
convection heat transfer
from the outside surface of horizontal and vertical cylinders in both
constant heat flux and temperature conditions. However, there are
poor studies in natural convection from inclined cylinders. In this
study, free convection heat transfer was examined experimentally from
the outside surface of a cylinder for glycerol and water at various
heat fluxes. The tests were performed at 10 different inclination
angles of the cylinder, namely, φ = 0°, 10°, 20°,
30°, 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°, and 90°,
measured from the horizon. Our results indicated that the average
Nusselt number reduces with the growth in the inclination of the cylinder
to the horizon at the same heat flux, and the average Nusselt number
enhanced with the growth in heat flux at the same angle. Also, the
average Nusselt number of water is greater than that of glycerol.
A new experimental model for predicting the average Nusselt number
is suggested, which has a satisfactory accuracy for experimental data.

1 Introduction
In a wide range of industrial
processes including high solar collectors,
voltage power transmission lines, and nuclear safety systems, natural
convection is used from the outside surface of a cylinder for cooling
and heating. A large number of studies have investigated natural convection
heat transfer from the outside surface of horizontal and vertical
cylinders in both constant heat flux and temperature conditions. However,
there is very limited data on natural convection heat transfer for
pure liquids from an inclined cylinder.1−5 The aim of this study was investigating the existing gap. Thus,
the impact of the inclination angle was studied on natural convection
heat transfer from the outside surface of a cylinder.

2 Literature Review
Natural convection is a type of heat transport
or mechanism in
which no external source is the cause of the fluid motion (such as
fan, pump, etc.); however, the density diversity in the fluid occurs
only because of temperature gradients.6,7 In the literature,
there are numerous experimental and numerical studies about natural
convection heat transfer from a vertical flat plate, vertical cylinder,
inclined flat plate facing down, inclined flat plate facing up, horizontal
cylinder, and horizontal flat plate, and many more correlations have
been suggested.

According to comprehensive research performed
by Nada and Mowad,2 for free convection
from a vertical flat plate,
many previous researchers obtained the expressions of the average
Nusselt number for different ranges of Rayleigh numbers (McAdams,8 Sparrow and Gregg,9 Warner and Arpaci,10 and Churchill and
Chu11). Suryanarayana12 indicated that for a downward facing heated or an upward
facing cooled inclined isothermal surface, the correlation for free
convection heat transfer from a vertical flat plate can be utilized
by the component of the gravitational force parallel to the plate
to assess Rayleigh number. Fujii and Imura13 investigated free convection from an isothermal upward facing heated
inclined plate. The results indicated that the Grashof number is affected
by the boundary layer surrounding the surface. Fussey and Warneford14 suggested two correlations for the Nusselt number
with various ranges of inclination angle. Some experiments were conducted
by McAdams,8 Fujii and Imura,13 Goldstein et al.,15 and Lloyd and Moran16 on free convection
heat transfer from upward facing and downward heated horizontal rectangular
plates for horizontal flat plates, and they suggested correlations
for the two cases at different ranges of Rayleigh numbers. Churchill
and Chu17 and Morgan18 proposed comprehensive correlations for free convection
from a horizontal cylinder for a broad range of Rayleigh number. Wide-ranging
research on free convection from a horizontal cylinder was also conducted
by Özgür Atayilmaz19 and
Teke.20 However, Chen et al.36 investigated the impact of geometry on the flow
surrounding a cylinder in crossflow. Three various stepped-diameter
circular cylinders (SDCCs) were used with different step heights.

Through using the cylinder diameter (D) and inclination
angle (φ), Lia and Tarasuk21 suggested
the correlation NuD = m(ϕ)RaDn (ϕ). Al-Arabi
and Khamis4 suggested the correlation NuL = m(ϕ)RaLn (ϕ) using the inclination angle φ
and cylinder length L, and the variation of L and
φ depends on the angle of inclination. Farber and Rennat22 conducted an experiment with a stainless steel
tube with a 6 ft (1.829 m) length and 0.125 in. (3.175 mm) OD, which
was heated by inserting an electric current through it for producing
a constant heat flux.

The inclination angle of the tube ranged
from 0° to 90°,
and temperatures were achieved as high as 760 °C. Khamis23 investigated steam-heated brass tubes at a constant
temperature with different diameters and lengths. The Gr and Pr were
ranged from 9.88 × 107 to 2.93 × 1010, and the inclination angle of the tube ranged from 30° to 90°. Oosthuizen24 conducted an experiment
with aluminum cylinders. The length ranged from 152.4 to 304.8 mm,
the diameters from 19.1 to 25.4 mm and the inclination angle from
0° to 90°. The heat transfer was obtained evaluating the
amount at which the cylinders were cooled to 90 °C after being
heated monotonically to 100 °C.

Many studies have recommended
the natural convection heat transfer
correlations for horizontal, vertical, and inclined cylinders25 (Table 1). Research conducted by Heo and Chung25 indicated that the heat transfer correlations for inclined
cylinders suggested by Oosthuizen,24 Sedahmed
and Shemilt,26 Al-Arabi and Salman,3 Buck,27 and Stewart28 at ϕ = 0° are not consistent with
the correlations for a horizontal cylinder recommended by Morgan18 and Fand et al.29 The suggested correlation for a vertical cylinder at ϕ = 90°
is consistent with the Le Fevre30 correlation
for laminar conditions but is not in agreement with the Fouad and
Ibl31 correlation for turbulent conditions.
Jafarpur and Yovanovich32,33 studied an analytical
method for the area’s mean Nusselt number of free convection
heat transfer, (Rayleigh number ranged from 0–10).8 Prhashanna and Chhabra34,35 studied free convective heat transfer for a horizontal cylinder
immersed in quiescent power-law fluids numerically. Goldstein et al.36−39 investigated the impact of geometry on the flow surrounding a cylinder
in crossflow. They found that the mass/heat transfer analogy is verified
experimentally for laminar, two-dimensional, and turbulent boundary
layer flows over the cylinder and flat plates.

3 Materials
and Methodology
3.1 Setup
Figure 1 shows the experimental
equipment used in
the current research. The stainless steel vessel has a cubic shape
containing nearly 20 L of the test liquid. In order to maintain predetermined
operating conditions, the system is persistently monitored and regulated.
A PC-based data acquisition system registered the measuring parameters.
Also, to change the angle of the cylinder, a hydraulic jack was used.
A digital protractor was employed to read these angles. For more controllability
and to reduce heat loss, the whole system is heavily insulated.

Figure 1 Experimental
apparatus in this study.

The vessel contains two heaters: (1) an auxiliary heater
to enhance
the bulk temperature to any set point and (2) a rod heater, which
is comprised of an internally heated stainless steel rod with 15 thermocouples
of stainless steel mounted at five axial locations.

Each axial
location has three thermocouples that are distributed
equally on the circumference of the test section near the heating
surface. The injection of silicon paste into the position of each
thermocouple is performed to reduce thermal contact resistance between
each sheath and thermocouple. Two thermocouples positioned far from
the hot cylinder were used to measure the bulk temperature. Also,
a paper with the roughness of 400 μm was used to polish the
surface of the cylinder in order to reduce the impact of surface roughness
on heat transfer. The rod heater works with variable A/C electrical
power input. The calculation of electrical input power of the rod
heater was carried out through the product of the electrical voltage,
cosine, and current of the diversity between the current and input
electrical voltage. Details of the rod heater are indicated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Rod heater.

Using the heat conduction equation for cylinders,
the temperature
drop is given by eq 1 due to the existence of short distance between the surface and thermocouple
location. 1  where k is
the temperature thermal conductivity of the heater. It was approximated
to a linear function of temperature.

It is estimated that the
axial heat loss is less than 0.05% of
the total heat transfer.30−32 However, in these sorts of experiments,
uncertainty in heat flux and heat transfer coefficient measurements
are very important to estimate. In this study, the method created
by Jafarpur et al. was used to calculate uncertainties.33 The distance between thermocouples, thermocouple calibration, and
thermal conductivity of stainless steel contributed in the unknown
calculations.

There are two significant errors while doing the
experiment: precision
and bias errors. Precision errors are because of testing sensitive
devices. Bias errors come from calibration. These errors are stated
as 2  where Uy is the uncertainty or total error, By is the bias error, and Py is
the precision error. Thermocouple calibrations, stainless steel thermal
conductivity, and the distance between thermocouples were the error
parameters. The thermocouples were calibrated and their correctness
error was obtained statistically as ±0.2 K.

The calculation
of heated surface temperature (Ts) was
carried out by the heat flux (q″) generated
by the experimental heater and heater temperature (Tth) measured by the thermocouple.34 This is due to the fact that the direct measurement
of temperature is linked to variations in the heated surface geometry. 3  q″ is the heat flux. It was obtained using eq 4 as follows 4  where Vheater is the voltage, Icircuit is the electric
current of the experimental heater, and Asur is the surface area of the heated surface.

To calculate the
pool boiling heat transfer coefficient, it was
necessary to extrapolate the surface temperature of the test surface
of the heater.40−42 The free
convection heat transfer coefficient is an indicator of a fluid thermal
performance, which was obtained using eq 5 5  where Tsat is the saturation temperature,
and Tw is the temperature at the heated
surface. The indeterminacies
for heat flux were obtained using eq 6. 6  

The multimeter readings and thermocouples were repeated three
times
to certify data reproducibility. Table 2 depicts the indeterminacies for measurement equipment
used in the present study.

According to the measurement accuracy
displayed in Table 2 and using the above method
(eq 6), the maximum error
for heat flux was 3.32%.

3.2 Experimental Procedure
The input
power and inclination angle of the test section are the two independent
variables in these experiments. Testing procedures for each fluid
can be classified asA. Regulating the heater on the desired
inclination angle.

B. Filling
the test container with fluid.

C. Setting the bulk temperature as desired
(50 °C).

D. Setting
the input voltage as desired
(5 V).

E. Recording data
after 15 min to ensure
a steady state condition so that the thermocouple temperatures are
stabilized.

F. Increasing
input voltage (at a constant
inclination angle) at a rate of 5 V and repeating step E.

G. Repeating step F until
the first vapor
bubble is observed, that is, the end of the test at the set inclination
angle.

H. Increasing the
heater’s inclination
angle to 10° and repeating steps C to G until 90°.



3.3 The Range of Parameters
and Test Solutions
In the present study, glycerol and pure
water were employed due
to the following reasons:

(a) Pure water is readily available
and has many resources, so its known chemical and physical properties
are given; it has been one of the most widely used liquids in people’s
routine life and different industries, especially those involving
heat transfer equipment such as heat exchangers. Thus, it is of great
value to have information about the heat transfer coefficient of pure
water. (b) Glycerin has been employed in many industries including
soap making, cosmetics and hygiene, making explosives, lubrication
of tools and other metal installation, and antifreeze of hydraulic
jacks. Thus, data on the heat transfer coefficient of glycerin can
be advantageous for the abovementioned industries.

Table 3 shows the
range of operating conditions in the current study, which are derived
from authentic handbooks.37,38

4 Data Reduction
The local heat transfer coefficient is calculated from the following
equation: 7  The average heat transfer
coefficient for a cylinder with a length (L) is given
as follows 8  where i is the position of wall thermocouple on the axial
location of the tube, as indicated in Figure 2, and Ti is the
circumferential averaged local temperature at this axial position.The
average Nusselt number along the tube was calculated as 9  The physical
properties were
calculated at the mean film temperature . In total, 141 tests were performed in
this study, which covers the following values and ranges:        

5 Results and Discussion
According to the obtained results
and the Rayleigh number calculated,
it appears that in all angles and heat fluxes of the cylinder, the
laminar flow is dominant. Figures 3 and 4 indicate the variations
of the local heat transfer coefficients of water and glycerol with
the length of the cylinder for the different angles of inclination
and flux of 5500 W·m–1. The local heat transfer
coefficients are constant in the horizontal position. In a similar
way, Al-Arabi and Salman3 have reported
that the local heat transfer coefficients are constant for the horizontal
position. For other angles of inclination, there is a reduction in
local heat transfer coefficients with increasing the axial distance
measured from the bottom of the cylinder.5,35 All
the other heat fluxes behave in the same way. The reason is an increase
in the boundary layer thickness, which leads to the decrease in the
heat transfer coefficient. In addition, at the same axial positions,
the local heat transfer coefficients decrease with the increase of
inclination angle; the value is the maximum for the horizontal position
of the cylinder. The results also show that, at the same axial positions,
the local heat transfer coefficient of glycerol is smaller than that
of water.

Figure 3 Variation of h for water with cylinder length.

Figure 4 Variation of h for glycerol
with cylinder length.

It appears that this can be the result of physical properties
of
glycerol such as viscosity and thermal conductivity; the viscosity
of glycerol is greater and its thermal conductivity is smaller than
that of water. Consequently, this decreases the Ra number of glycerol
as compared to water. Figures 5 and 6 show the variations of hav with cylinder length for the same runs.

Figure 5 Variation
of h for water with cylinder length.

Figure 6 Variation of h for glycerol with cylinder
length.

Figures 5 and 6 indicate that
at the same value of cylinder length, hav is the maximum for the horizontal cylinder
and decreases with the growth of inclination angle. Also, as cylinder
length increases, the average heat transfer coefficient decreases. hav is constant for the horizontal position.

Figure 7 indicates
the comparison of the average heat transfer coefficient of glycerol
with the local heat transfer coefficient. Experimental data demonstrate
that for the horizontal position, hav is
equal to the local heat transfer coefficient. However, for other angles
of inclination, the average heat transfer coefficient is greater than
the local heat transfer coefficient. Experimental data for water shows
the same characteristics.

Figure 7 Comparison of the average heat transfer coefficient
with the local
heat transfer coefficients.

Figure 8 indicates
the impact of the inclination angle on the local and average Nusselt
number (heat flux: 5000 W·m–2, x = L = 0.1 m). As indicated in the figure, with
the increase in the inclination angle of the cylinder, the average
and local Nusselt number decrease. It is true for other heat fluxes
and cylinder lengths (x). Also, for glycerol, the
variations of the Nusselt number with the inclination angle are smaller
than those of water.

Nusselt
number.

5.1 Comparison with Literature
Comparing
the equations obtained for the inclined, horizontal, and vertical
cylinders with the generally accepted ones is significantly helpful.
This is performed to assess the accuracy of the apparatus. Comparing
this study against those in the literature is difficult, because there
is no study available in the literature for the present geometry,
orientations, and surface material.

5.1.1 Horizontal
Figure 9 shows the
evaluation of the experimental
average Nusselt number (horizontal cylinder) with the prior studies
for water. Our results are consistent with all the previous investigations.
Churchill and Chu correlation demonstrate the best prediction for
experimental data (Churchill and Chu: 18.7%, Morgan: 21.5%, Fand et
al.: 25%).17,18,29

Figure 9 Comparison
of the experimental average Nusselt number for the horizontal
cylinder with the prior studies.

5.1.2 Vertical
Figure 10 indicates the evaluation of the experimental
average Nusselt number for the presented vertical cylinder in this
study against previous ones for water and glycerol. Our results are
consistent with all the previous investigations shown in Figure 10. However, in fluxes
less than 8000 W·m–2, it was observed that
there is a significant diversion between experimental data and previous
correlations; however, in higher fluxes, the diversion is less than
15%.

Figure 10 Comparison of the experimental average Nusselt number for the vertical
cylinder with the prior studies for water.

5.1.3 Inclined
Figure 11 shows the evaluation of the experimental
average Nusselt number for the inclined cylinder with the opposing
prior studies for water. Our results are consistent with all the previous
investigations. Stewart and Buck’s correlation indicated the
most diversion, and Stewart’s correlation showed the least
diversion.

Figure 11 Comparison of the experimental average
Nusselt number for the vertical cylinder with the prior studies (a:
water (L = L), b: water (L = D)).

Figure 12 compares
various correlations for the average Nusselt number in all inclinations.
The absolute average error is given using eq 10: 10  

Figure 12 Comparison of the experimental average Nusselt number for all inclination
angles with the previous studies.

It is worthy of noting that Oosthuizen’s correlation
can
be neither used in a horizontal position nor a vertical position.
Also, correlations of Stewart and Buck, Stewart, and Sedahmed and
Shemilt cannot be employed in the vertical position. Considering this
point and Figure 12, the correlation of Churchill and Chu for the horizontal position,
Fouad and Ibl’s correlation for the vertical position and for
the other inclination angles, Stewart’s correlation, and Oosthuizen’s
correlation are consistent with experimental data. The diversity between
the proposed relations (for example, Stewart and Buck27) and empirical data is not indicative of their imprecision.
This may be due to variant experimental conditions including heater
geometry, roughness, working fluid, heater material, and range of
Prandtl number.

5.1.4 New Empirical Model
The functional
equation for the average heat transfer coefficient in natural convection
can be represented as below: 11  In this research, new dimensionless
groups were made from all of the available influencing parameters
except the inclination angle, and effects of the inclination angle
on the characteristic length and experimental constants were considered.

The influencing parameters include the average heat transfer coefficient,
thermal conductivity |Tw – T∞|, characteristic length, kinematics
viscosity, thermal diffusivity, volume expansion coefficient, and
acceleration of gravity. In total, there are eight parameters with
five dimensions including power, length, temperature, time, and mass.
The following dimensionless have been acquired using Buckingham’s
π theorem: 12   13   14  It appears that π2 and π3 usually
emerge as a product. This
product is called the Rayleigh number as 15  so we expect data are correlated
with functional equations of the form 16  where the Nusselt number
and Rayleigh number are based on the characteristic length Lc. Researchers have suggested different values
of characteristic length for different geometry and surface positions,
but this parameter has not been discussed in any study for inclined
cylinders. In the present study, the characteristic length (Lc) is considered as a function of the inclination
angle as shown in eq 17: 17  

The variations of the average Nusselt number in terms of the
average
Ra for the horizontal position are shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 Variation of Nu with Ra.

As shown in Figure 13 and eq 16, A = 0.174 and B = 0.326. Thus 18  

Almost the same A is obtained
by the other angles
of inclination, but B is different. B can be a function of sin ϕ. Figure 13 indicates the variations of B with sin ϕ for heat flux (for example, heat flux is 5500 W·m–2).
