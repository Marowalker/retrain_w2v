In this paper, we
report our study on high-performance III-nitride
nanowire light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on copper (Cu) substrates via
the substrate-transfer process. Nanowire LED structures were first
grown on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy.
Subsequently, the SOI substrate was removed by combining dry- and
wet-etching processes. Compared to conventional nanowire LEDs on Si,
the nanowire LEDs on Cu exhibit several advantages, including more
efficient thermal management and enhanced light-extraction efficiency
(LEE) because of the usage of metal reflectors and highly thermally
conductive metal substrates. The LED on Cu, therefore, has stronger
photoluminescence, electroluminescence intensities, and better current–voltage
characteristics compared to the conventional nanowire LED on Si. Our
simulation results further confirm the improved device performance
of LEDs on Cu, compared to LEDs on Si. The LEE of the nanowire LED
on Cu is nine times higher than that of the LED on Si at the same
nanowire radius of 60 nm and spacing of 130 nm. Moreover, by engineering
the device-active region, we achieved high-brightness phosphor-free
LEDs on Cu with highly stable white-light emission and high color-rendering
index of ∼95, showing their promising applications in general
lighting, flexible displays, and wearable applications.

Introduction
III-Nitride semiconductors have been intensively
studied for application
in optoelectronic devices, because of the superb advantages offered
by this material system.1,2 The direct energy bandgap
III-nitride semiconductors can absorb or emit light efficiently over
a broad spectrum, ranging from ∼0.65 eV (InN) to 6.4 eV (AlN),
which encompasses from a deep ultraviolet to near infrared spectrum.1,3 However, owing to the lack of native substrates, conventional III-nitride
planar heterostructures generally exhibit very high dislocation densities
that severely limit the device performance and reliability. On the
other hand, nanowire heterostructures can be grown on lattice mismatched
substrates with drastically reduced dislocation densities, owing to
the highly effective lateral stress relaxation.4,5 The
growth of the nearly defect-free III-nitride nanowire heterostructures
has been reported on various substrates, including Si and sapphire.6−8 Moreover, nanowires have emerged as a powerful platform to effectively
scale down the dimensions of the devices and systems, ideally suited
for the future nanophotonic and nanoelectronic devices.9−12 Nanowire light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with emission in the ultraviolet
to visible wavelength range have been intensively studied for the
applications in solid-state lighting, flat-panel displays, and solar-blind
detectors.13−17 However, the currently reported nanowire LEDs generally exhibit
very low external quantum efficiency, which may be attributed to the
presence of defects on nanowire surfaces18 and/or low light extraction efficiency (LEE).19 Moreover, III-nitride nanowire LEDs are normally grown
on the Si substrates, which may largely absorb the photon emitted
from the LED-active region, severely limiting the light output power.
Additionally, the Si semiconductor exhibits low electrical conductivity
and thermal expansion coefficients compared to a metal substrate.20 High-power LED applications, however, require
large-area chips and can operate at a high injection current which
mostly will heat up the devices. Generally, quantum efficiencies,
output power, and lifetime reduce rapidly when the junction temperature
increases.21 Therefore, managing heat dissipation
is seriously considered. Besides the applications in solid-state lighting
illumination, the use of LEDs in telecommunications and decoration
displays for the flexible electronics devices has also been intensively
developed owing to the feasible integration of such LEDs in these
electronic devices.22−26 Organic LEDs have been first studied because of their ease to grow
on plastic substrates. However, for these types of LEDs, high electrical
performance, low resistance, long-term reliability, and controlled
doping concentrations still remain challenging issues.27,28 These issues can be addressed in inorganic semiconductors using
III–V and related materials. In this regard, the replacement
of the Si substrate by a suitable metal, therefore, promises the improved
device performance, including high output power and less heating effect.29 In this paper, we have systematically developed
high-brightness InGaN/AlGaN nanowire full-color LEDs on a copper (Cu)
substrate from both simulation and experiment. The simulation results
show that LEDs on Cu have significantly enhanced LEE compared to the
other LED structures, which is ∼9 and 7 times higher than that
of LEDs on Si and flip-chip LEDs on the Si substrates, respectively.
The experimental results further confirm that the LED on the Cu substrate
shows significantly enhanced light output intensity and better current–voltage
characteristics over the conventional LEDs on Si substrates. Moreover,
highly stable white-light emission with color rendering index of ∼95
was recorded for the flip-chip nanowire LED on the Cu substrate because
of the properly controlled indium composition in the device-active
region.

Simulation and Device Structure
Illustrated in Figure 1, three InGaN/AlGaN
nanowire LED structures were comprehensively
studied utilizing the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method.
These LED structures include conventional p-side up nanowire LEDs
on Si substrates (LED 1), n-side up LEDs on Si substrates (LED 2),
and n-side up LEDs on metal substrates (LED 3), shown in Figure 1a–c, respectively.
The n-side up LEDs are also called as the flip-chip LEDs throughout
this paper.

Figure 1 Schematic structures of (a) LED 1, (b) LED 2, and (c) LED 3 with
peak emission wavelength at 550 nm.

The device structure is composed of an n-GaN layer, an InGaN/AlGaN
multiple quantum well-active region, and a p-GaN layer. The active
region is composed of 10 InGaN wells (3 nm-thick layer) sandwiched
by 3 nm AlGaN barrier layers. The thicknesses of n- and p-type GaN
regions are 350 and 150 nm, respectively. The underlying substrate
is assumed to be Si and metal for the typical and flip-chip InGaN/AlGaN
nanowire LEDs, respectively. The refractive indices of the AlGaN and
n-GaN/p-GaN regions considered in all simulations are 2.6 and 2.5,
respectively.

The flip-chip LEDs exhibit lower forward voltage
and series resistance,
which can be accounted for the enhanced current spreading in the p-GaN
layer. This can be attributed to the reason that the whole p-GaN layer
is in contact with the Cu layer here, thereby improving the innate
high resistivity of the p-GaN, as reported in similar work.30 Hence, during the design phase of the nanowires,
we have further optimized the p-GaN thickness to study the effect
of p-GaN thickness on the LEE of nanowire LEDs.

Lumerical FDTD
solution31 is employed
to numerically investigate and compare the LEE of nanowire LEDs versus
the spacing and radius of the nanowires. The measuring monitors placed
above and around the LEDs collect all optical power emitted from the
designed nanowire device structures. The LEE is defined as the ratio
of the power emerging from the structure to the total power generated
within the active region by the dipole. Generally, III-nitride nanowire
LEDs grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) have radius in the range
of 20–80 nm.7,32−34 In our simulation,
therefore, we first considered the nanowire array with a hexagonal
arrangement of 50 nm radius and the nanowire center-to-center spacing
of 130 nm for all LED devices. The geometry of the nanowires has a
dominant effect in the emission of generated photons from the active
region into air. The radius and spacing of the nanowires are among
the parameters which can be used to maximize the LEE of nanowire LEDs.
With proper design of nanowire spacing and radius, the light can be
coupled through nanowires and scattered out of the device.

Figure 2a,b depict
the LEE versus radius at a constant spacing of 130 nm, and LEE versus
spacing at a constant nanowire radius of 50 nm, respectively. Shown
in Figure 2a, LED 2
demonstrated an enhancement in the LEE compared to LED 1 because of
the shorter distance between the active region and the Si substrate,
consequently stronger reflection from the substrate. When compared
to the light-absorptive properties of the silicon material, the flip-chip
LEDs with light-reflective mirrors have been reported to have an enhanced
LEE.30,35,36 The aforementioned
argument has been used to support the fact that LED 3 has a higher
LEE compared to LED 2, attributed to the presence of a stronger reflection
of light from the metal/Cu substrate and also because of the reduced
absorption in Cu as compared to the Si substrate.37,38 The stronger reflection ensures a higher probability of light generated
from the active region to be reflected back from the substrate, which
is eventually extracted after multiple total internal reflections
inside the LED structure. Moreover, the presence of a metal layer
in the flip-chip LEDs ensures the formation of a good Ohmic contact
at the p-type region35,36 and serves as the optical reflector
and the current spreading layer39 to facilitate
the current injection to LED-active regions.

(a) change in spacing (for a constant radius
of 50 nm) and (b) change in radius (constant spacing of 130 nm). (c)
Electric-field distribution plot from top monitor for a flip-chip
LED on the metal. (d) Electric-field plot from top monitor for a normal
p–i–n LED structure on the Si substrate.

Variation of critical parameters such as radius
and spacing between
nanowires play an important role on LEE. As shown in Figure 2, there is an optimum radius
and spacing to avoid photonic bandgap (PBG) and have a high LEE. The
electric-field plots depicted in Figure 2c,d show the electric-field distribution
for both flip-chip LED structures on Cu and typical LED structures
on Si substrate, respectively. Both flip-chip structures refer to
regular periodic structures with a radius of 50 nm and a center-to-center
spacing of 130 nm. Illustrated in Figure 2c, in the flip-chip structure, the light
is not locally stagnant, rather much better propagated within the
structure. In other words, as compared to a conventional LED device
composed of multiple nanowires, there is a contribution from the majority
of the nanowires within the device toward light extraction, as opposed
to a normal p-side up structure on the Si substrate (as shown in Figure 2d), where the light
extraction is typically concentrated toward the center and only a
minority of nanowires (placed in the middle of the device) contribute
to the light extraction.

We have further considered a variation
in nanowire radius and wire
spacing for nanowire LEDs in which the nanowires are randomly arranged
because the self-organized III-nitride nanowires are not naturally
periodically arranged on the substrate. Figure 3a represents the LEEs of the 16 typical random
flip-chip LED structures with different nanowire radius and spacing.
The radius from 47.5 to 52.5 nm and center-to-center spacing in the
range of 125–135 nm were considered. The LEE of the random
LED structure has an average LEE of 26.79%, whereas that of the nanowire
LEDs with nanowire radius of 50 nm and a spacing of 130 nm is 9.61%.
For periodic structures, the LED devices may operate in the PBG mode,
whereas for the same amount of randomness in a random structure, there
is the probability of the device working outside the scope of PBG
modes. Figure 3b depicts
the effect of the p-GaN thickness on the LEE of a flip-chip device
structure. Modification in the p-GaN thickness of the nanowire has
a sizable contribution to the LEE. p-GaN shows a strong variation
in the trend of LEE with p-type thickness. The latter behavior is
explained by the superimposition/interference effect between the forward
and backward traveling photons.40 The latter
reaffirms the necessary constraints for constructive reflection occurring
within the active region of the nanowire. This in turn stresses the
need for optimizing the p-type layer thickness for the best LEE. Compared
to the previously mentioned parameters, the p-GaN shows a strong variation
in the LEE. It is even worse for smaller thickness because of the
high reflection from the reflective layer on the top of the substrate.

diameter and nanowire spacing between them. (b) Variation of p-type
height with the LEE of a flip-chip (n–i–p) structure

Figure 3c,d
represents
the electric-field contour plots of a random flip-chip LED on the
metal and random normal p–i–n structure on the Si substrate,
respectively. As in the case depicted in Figure 2c,d periodic nanowire structures, the distribution
of contribution toward light extraction remains the same in the random
flip-chip and regular random p–i–n structures, illustrated
in Figure 3c,d.

Results
and Discussion
Highly uniform nanowire LEDs with a radius
of ∼60 nm were
grown on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, shown in Figure 4. The device-active
region consists of 10 vertically aligned InGaN/AlGaN quantum dots,
which can provide white-light emission, because of the In compositional
variations (∼10–50%) of the InGaN-active region.41,42 Each InGaN quantum well has a thickness of ∼3 nm and is capped
by ∼3 nm AlGaN layer. Detailed growth conditions for such nanowire
LED heterostructures were described in previous publications.6,41,43,44

Figure 4 45°

The surface morphology and orientation of the nanowire
LEDs grown
directly on the SOI substrate are much more uniform compared to those
of the nanowire LEDs grown on the SiO2-on-Si substrate
reported in our previous study because of the local surface roughness
of amorphous SiO2-on-Si.45,46 Such properties
may lead to higher optical and structural performances of the LEDs
on SOI compared with LEDs on the SiO2-on-Si wafers.

As shown in Figure 5a, after being transferred to the Cu substrate, the photoluminescence
(PL) intensity of the nanowire LED on Cu (LED 3) is enhanced by a
factor of 1.5 compared to that of the as-grown LED nanowires on the
SOI substrate. Such an enhancement is mainly attributed to the improved
light extraction efficiencies because of the significantly reduced
light absorption after removing the Si substrate. Moreover, the Ni/Au
bilayer may work efficiently as a reflector to further enhance the
LEE.20 This further confirms that the nanowire
damage during the transferring process is almost negligible. A small
blue shift of ∼1.5 nm was recorded for the nanowire LED on
Cu compared to that of the nanowire LED on the SOI substrate, which
is attributed to the fact that the strain has been relaxed owing to
the release of nanowires from the SOI substrate.47 The electroluminescence (EL) intensity of LED 3 was measured
nearly twice higher than that of the regular nanowire LED on Si (LED
1), as shown in Figure 5b. Such enhanced PL and EL intensities agree well with the simulation
results presented in Figures 2 and 3.

Cu (blue curves) and conventional nanowire LEDs on the SOI substrates
(black curves). (b) EL spectra of the flip-chip nanowire LED on Cu
(blue curves) and the conventional nanowire LED on Si substrates (black

Figure 6a shows
the current–voltage characteristics of a nanowire LED on Cu
compared to a similar growth condition nanowire LED on Si substrates.
The LEDs on the Cu substrate (LED 3) exhibit excellent current–voltage
characteristics and show lower leakage current and slightly higher
current in forward bias, compared to the LED device on the Si substrate
(LED 1) at the same voltage. At 20 mA injection current, the operating
voltages for LED 3 and LED 1 are 3.2 and 4.1 V, respectively. At −8
V reversed bias, the corresponding currents for LED 3 and LED 1 are
−0.5 and −1.5 mA, respectively. The lower voltage of
LED 3 may be attributed to the better heat dissipation and substrate
conductivity of the nanowire LED on the Cu substrate, which is consistent
with other reports.21,48,49 As shown in the inset of Figure 6a, the optical image of light emission from the LED
device on the Cu substrate demonstrates the successful fabrication
of such a nanowire on metal substrates. Figure 6b shows the relative light output power of
both LED 1 and LED 3 for comparison. It is shown that LED 3 exhibits
stronger output power compared to that of LED 1. Such an output power
enhancement is attributed to the enhanced LEE in LED 3, which was
explained previously. To further increase the output power of LED
3, several limiting factors should be considered and addressed, for
instance, improving the transparency of the top Ti/Au/ITO metal contact
and optimizing the nanowire geometry including wire density, diameter,
and height.

current characteristics of the conventional nanowire LED on the Si
substrate (LED 1) and nanowire LED on Cu (LED 3).

We have further developed phosphor-free white LEDs on the
Cu substrate
by engineering the In composition in the InGaN-active region, thereby,
white-light emission with full visible spectrum was achieved. This
method was reported elsewhere.16

Figure 7a shows
the EL spectra of the phosphor-free white LEDs on the Cu substrate
under different injection currents. The experiment was conducted under
pulse bias condition with a duty cycle of 1% to minimize the junction
heating effect. The peak wavelength is almost stable when the current
increases from 50 to 500 mA, attributed to the low-quantum-confined
Stark effect.50 Moreover, the LED device
achieves stable white-light emission on the CIE diagram, shown in Figure 7b. The device achieves
a high CRI of ∼95 showing a promise as a candidate for solid-state
lighting and display.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the high-performance
InGaN/AlGaN
nanowire white LEDs on the Cu substrate without using any phosphor
converter. The improved performance including stronger PL and EL intensities,
and current–voltage behavior were recorded for the transferred
nanowire LED on the Cu substrate, compared to the conventional LED
on Si. Such enhancements are attributed to the reduced light absorption
by the substrate, the enhanced LEE, and the reduced heating effect.
Moreover, the substrate-transfer approach presented in this paper
can be applicable for fabricating the LED devices on metal substrates,
plastics, or many other platforms where the epitaxial growth of the
LED structures cannot be directly grown on, because of their high
growth temperature. This work also provides a promising approach for
the integration of III-nitride nanowire LEDs in future solid-state
lighting, visible light communication, and decoration displays as
flexible electronic devices.

Experimental Section
MBE Growth
The
self-organized InGaN/AlGaN nanowire
LED heterostructures were grown on the Si and SOI substrates by radio
frequency plasma-assisted Veeco Gen II MBE. The SOI wafer structure
includes 50 nm Si on 2 μm SiO2 and 725 μm Si
in which the SiO2 serves as an etch-stop layer during the
Si-etching process. The nitrogen flow was kept at 1.0 standard cubic
centimeter per minute (sccm) during the epitaxial growth process and
a forward plasma power of ∼350 W. The n-GaN and p-GaN were
grown at ∼770 °C, whereas the InGaN/AlGaN-active region
was grown at 640–680 °C to enhance the In incorporation.
The device active region consists of 10 vertically aligned InGaN/AlGaN
quantum dots, which can provide white light emission because of the
In compositional variations (∼10–50%) of the InGaN-active
region.

Device Fabrication
The fabrication process of LEDs
on the Cu substrate is described in Scheme 1. The nanowire LEDs were first grown on the
SOI substrate by MBE. A polyimide resist was then spin-coated to fully
cover the nanowire, followed by oxygen plasma etching to reveal the
nanowire top portions (Scheme 1a). Subsequently, polyimide was hard-baked at 350 °C
for 45 min. Metal contact with Ni (10 nm)/Au (150 nm) was then deposited
on top of the nanowires to serve as the p-type contact and also the
metal reflector, followed by electroplating of 150 μm Cu. Deep
reactive-ion etching was then applied to remove the Si substrate with
the etching rate of 12 μm/min, illustrated in Scheme 1b. The etch-stop SiO2 layer was then removed by buffered oxide etching solution, whereas
the remaining Si top-layer was removed by tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide.
Finally, Ti (5 nm)/Au (5 nm)/ITO (200 nm) and Ti (10 nm)/Au (100 nm)
were deposited to serve as the top-metal contacts, shown in Scheme 1c. The LEDs on the
Si substrate were also fabricated for comparison. Devices with areal
size of 1 × 1 mm2 were used for characterization.
For a fair comparison, all measurements were performed on the LEDs
at similar locations on the wafers for both LEDs on Cu and LEDs on
Si substrates.

Scheme 1 Fabrication Procedure of Nanowire LEDs on the Cu Substrate
Characterization
Detailed optical and electrical characterizations
of the nanowire LEDs on the Cu substrate were performed. PL study
was performed by using a 405 nm laser as the excitation source with
a microscope objective, a high-resolution spectrometer, and a photomultiplier
tube to collect and detect the emissions from the LED samples. The
current–voltage measurements of the nanowire LEDs were measured
using a power supply (Keithley 2402). EL emission of the LED devices
was collected by an optical fiber directly connected to an Ocean Optics
spectrometer. All measurements were conducted at room temperature.
