A key problem in the conversion of
cellulose into chemicals and
fuels is the low product yield from cellulose due to its robust structure.
In this work, for the first time, cellulose was pretreated with coupling
of liquid nitrogen and ball milling (LN–BM) for cellulose hydrolysis.
After the LN–BM treatment, the glucose yield from cellulose
by HCl in water increased by almost 2 times and yield of formic acid
catalyzed by H2SO4–NaVO3 was
more than 3-fold that obtained from untreated cellulose. The yields
were also much higher than that from the individually ball-milled
cellulose. The structure variation of cellulose indicated that reduction
of both crystallinity index and molecular weight contributed to improving
the conversion efficiency, but the former was the dominant factor.
The combination of liquid nitrogen and ball milling developed in this
work is an effective and environment-friendly approach for cellulose
pretreatment.

==== Body
Introduction
Cellulose is the most abundant and renewable
biomass resource in
nature, with an estimated production of 1.5 × 1012 tons per year.1 Cellulose is composed
of glucose units, which can be converted to a variety of high-value-added
chemicals and fuels.2−7 Thus, lignocellulosic biomass has been regarded as one of the most
promising alternative to fossil resources. Unfortunately, the conversion
efficiency of native cellulose is usually very poor. This is because
cellulose is a polymer consisting of hundreds to thousands of β(1→4)
linked d-glucose units. The glucose chains are linked by
a network of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, endowing cellulose
with a robust crystal structure with high stability.8 Cellulose is insoluble in water and most of the organic
solvents. Therefore, cellulose is very difficult to be hydrolyzed
especially in water. During the past years, scientists all over the
world have concentrated on the technologies of improving the conversion
efficiency of cellulose.

Pretreatment is one of the most effective
ways to relieve the recalcitrance
of cellulose, thereby enhancing its utilization efficiency. Chemicals
such as acid and base have been used to pretreat cellulose.9,10 However, these chemicals are quite corrosive and they need to be
neutralized and removed after pretreatment. Explosion process such
as steam explosion11 and carbon dioxide
explosion12 is another widely used technique
to pretreat cellulose. However, the explosion process is usually conducted
under harsh conditions (high temperature/high pressure), followed
by the sudden reduction of the pressure leading to the mechanical
destruction of cellulose. Thus, the process needs high energy and
high temperature/pressure, which will cause some of the formed sugars
to decompose during the pretreatment. Biological treatment of cellulose
is a promising method with several advantages such as mild operation
condition and no waste production.13 Unfortunately,
biological treatments suffer from problems such as high cost and long
treatment time. Ionic liquid is a novel solvent that can dissolve
cellulose by destroying the hydrogen bonds in cellulose. Therefore,
ionic liquid has been used for the pretreatment of cellulose under
mild conditions and showed excellent performance.14−16 However, most
ionic liquids have side effects on enzymatic hydrolysis process and
their cost is still very high.

Recent studies have indicated
that ball milling (BM) is a powerful
physical technique to change the structure of biomass.17−20 With the mechanical milling treatment, the crystallinity of cellulose
could be reduced, which greatly improved the accessibility of catalysts
to the reactive sites of cellulose. Unlike most of the other cellulose
treatment methods, no chemicals are needed in the ball-milling process.
The ball-milling-pretreated cellulose can be directly used for the
following conversion reactions. To further improve the efficiency
of ball milling, in this work, coupling application of liquid nitrogen
(LN) and ball milling was developed for the pretreatment of cellulose.
Liquid nitrogen was widely used for the frozen treatment of biological
samples such as plant tissue to extract intracellular compounds.21 Besides, liquid nitrogen has been applied in
the mechanical production of cellulose microfibers.22 Castoldi et al. reported that liquid nitrogen pretreatment
was an effective way to improve the enzymatic digestibility of plant
biomass by decreasing lignin content, weakening the interaction between
lignin and hemicellulose or cellulose.23 Inspired by the above works of ball mill and liquid nitrogen, this
study aims to investigate the potential of coupling liquid nitrogen
and ball mill as a novel pretreatment way to improve the catalytic
conversion efficiency of cellulose.

Results and Discussion
Characteristics
of Cellulose before and after Pretreatments
Crystallinity
and molecular weight are important factors in determining
the cellulose hydrolysis efficiency.24,25 In this work,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) were
used to characterize the crystallinity and molecular weight variation
of cellulose, respectively. Figure 1 shows that the XRD patterns of cellulose without pretreatment
mainly have three diffraction peaks at 2θ = 17.6, 22.6, and
34.4°, corresponding to the (110), (200), and (004) reflections,
respectively. These XRD patterns are a typical cellulose Iβ crystalline structure.26 As can be seen
from Figure 1, the
intensities of the characteristic peaks decreased after both BM and
LN–BM pretreatments. Crystallinity index (CI) values calculated
from XRD are given in Table 1. The CI of raw cellulose without the pretreatment was 63.2%.
The high crystallization of the raw cellulose makes it extremely difficult
to be converted. The BM process has been proved to be an effective
method to reduce the crystallinity of cellulose. In this work, the
CI value of the BM-treated cellulose decreased with the increase of
milling time. After 3 h of BM treatment, the CI decreased from 63.2
to 44.3%. However, the CI of cellulose significantly decreased to
41.7% after only 2 h of LN–BM treatment and further decreased
to 39.4% after 3 h of LN–BM treatment. Therefore, LN–BM
was much more effective than BM to destructure the hydrogen bond networks
within cellulose. Such changes are expected to have great influence
on cellulose transformation.

different methods.

Mw	41 845	40 823	38 905	35 826	39 482	37 986	34 858	
Molecular
weight (Mw) of cellulose
was measured by GPC method. As shown in Table 1, there was some decrease in the Mw of cellulose after ball-milling pretreatments.
The Mw of cellulose pretreated by LN–BM
was slightly lower than that treated by only BM pretreatment. Compared
with cellulose without treatment, the variation of CI caused by BM
and LN–BM (from 29.9 to 37.7%) was more obvious than that of Mw (from 14.4 to 16.7%). Therefore, the reduction
of CI could be the main factor in determining the conversion of cellulose.

Hydrolysis of Cellulose to Glucose
Hydrolysis of cellulose
to glucose or oligosaccharides is the first and also the most difficult
step for cellulose utilization.27 Herein,
the LN–BM pretreatment of cellulose on its hydrolysis to glucose
in water was investigated. Figure 2 shows that ball-milling time had great influence on
the hydrolysis efficiency of cellulose. The yield of glucose increased
rapidly when the ball-milling time increased from 0 to 2 h. The maximum
yield of glucose from LN–BM-2 was 41.4%, which was slightly
lower than that from LN–BM-3 (42.2%). From the viewpoint of
energy consumption, the LN–BM treatment of cellulose for ball-milling
time of 2 h is appropriate, and the sample of LN–BM-2 was used
in the following studies.

Figure 2 Glucose production from cellulose pretreated
by LN–BM with
different times (0.05 g of cellulose, 5 mL of 0.025 M HCl aqueous
solution, 180 °C).

To prove the function of liquid nitrogen on the ball-milling
pretreatment
of cellulose, untreated cellulose and cellulose treated by sole ball
milling were used as control groups to produce glucose. The results
of comparison are shown in Figure 3. The maximum yield of glucose from untreated cellulose
was only 24.4%. After single BM treatment, the yield of glucose from
cellulose was significantly increased, and a maximum glucose yield
of 34.4% was obtained in 2 h reaction time. With the assistant of
liquid nitrogen, the maximum yield of glucose from LN–BM was
further improved to 41.4%. Moreover, the reaction time to reach the
maximum yield was also shortened to 1.5 h. Therefore, liquid nitrogen
freezing treatment of cellulose before ball milling is an effective
way to improve the pretreatment efficiency and thus enhance the cellulose
hydrolysis performance.

Figure 3 Comparison of the glucose yield from cellulose
treated by different
methods (0.05 g of cellulose, 5 mL of 0.025 M HCl aqueous solution,
180 °C).

Conversion of Untreated
and Pretreated Cellulose to Formic Acid
The LN–BM-pretreated
cellulose was also applied in the production
of formic acid in water. Formic acid is a commodity chemical that
can be applied in many fields such as organic synthesis and energy
storage. Generally, the conversion of cellulose to formic acid involves
two steps: hydrolysis of cellulose to monosaccharide and the subsequent
oxidation of the monosaccharide to formic acid.28 Herein, H2SO4–NaVO3 catalytic system was used to produce formic acid. They act as acid
catalyst and oxidation catalyst, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the yield of formic
acid from untreated cellulose was low and only 10.1% of formic acid
was formed within 2 h reaction time. However, the maximum yield of
formic acid increased significantly to 36.0% after LN–BM pretreatment.
This value was also much higher than that obtained from the single
BM-treated cellulose (26.4%). Figure 4 also shows that the reaction time to reach maximum
formic acid yield was shortened by the LN–BM treatment. The
above results proved that LN–BM is an effective way to improve
the cellulose conversion efficiency not only for the hydrolysis of
cellulose but also for the multistep process of cellulose utilization.

Figure 4 Formic
acid production from cellulose with different pretreatment
methods (0.1 g cellulose, 6 mL of NaVO3–H2SO4 aqueous solution (NaVO3: 0.35 wt %, H2SO4: 2 wt %), 180 °C, 3 MPa O2).

Conclusions
This
study demonstrated that liquid-nitrogen-assisted ball milling
(LN–BM) is an effective way to pretreat cellulose for increasing
its conversion to value-added chemicals such as glucose and formic
acid. Compared with cellulose treated with traditional single ball-milling
treatment (BM), LN–BM-pretreated cellulose was more easily
converted. This can be attributed to the fact that crystallinity and
molecular weight of cellulose could be reduced more readily with the
assistance of liquid nitrogen. The developed LN–BM process
is an effective and green way for cellulose pretreatment that has
advantages such as no corrosion and no need of chemicals and separation
step.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Microcrystalline cellulose
was purchased
from Yuanye Bio-Technique Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Glucose, formic
acid, and sodium metavanadate (NaVO3) were obtained from
Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Hydrochloric
acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were provided
by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Beijing, China).

Pretreatment
of Cellulose
Microcrystalline cellulose
was pretreated by liquid-nitrogen-assisted ball milling (LN–BM).
Typically, 2 g of cellulose was added to a stainless steel pot (50
mL) along with 15 zirconium oxide balls (diameter of 8.50 mm). Then,
30 mL of liquid nitrogen was poured into the pot. After the evaporation
of liquid nitrogen, the pot was immediately placed in a planetary
ball miller (Retsch PM100, Germany). The speed was set as 300 rpm.
The freezing cellulose was ball-milled for 1, 2, and 3 h. The obtained
cellulose samples were denoted as LN–BM-1, LN–BM-2,
and LN–BM-3, respectively. For comparison, cellulose was pretreated
with sole ball milling (BM), and the process was the same as that
for LN–BM but without the addition of liquid nitrogen.

Characterization
of Cellulose Samples
The structures
of cellulose before and after treatments were characterized with X-ray
diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Germany) and gel permeation chromatography
(GPC, Waters 1525). XRD analysis was conducted on the X-ray diffraction
equipment. The crystallinity indexes (CI) of all the samples were
calculated according to formula 1 1  where Icrystalline is
the intensity of the crystalline peak (∼22°) and Iamorphous is the intensity of the amorphous
peak (∼17.5°).

GPC was performed on Waters 1525
chromatography system equipped with an refractive index (RI) detector
(Waters 2414). The column was Agilent PLGEL 5 μm MIXED-C. The
mobile phase was dimethylformamide with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The
injection volume was 10 μL. Polystyrene was used as the standard.

Hydrolysis of Pretreated Cellulose to Glucose and Formic Acid
Hydrolysis of the pretreated cellulose to glucose was performed
in a 30 mL stainless steel autoclave. Typically, 0.05 g of pretreated
cellulose with 5 mL of diluted HCl aqueous solution (0.025 M) was
added into the steel autoclave. The reaction was conducted in the
closed autoclave at 180 °C for different times (0.5–3
h). After the reaction, the mixture was filtered and the glucose concentration
in the filtrate was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC).

Conversion of the pretreated cellulose to formic acid
was carried out in a 30 mL stainless steel autoclave with gas inlet
and outlet. Typically, 100 mg of cellulose sample and 6 mL of NaVO3–H2SO4 aqueous solution (NaVO3: 0.35 wt %, H2SO4: 2 wt %) was added
into the autoclave, which was sealed and purged with O2 for three times. After the introduction of O2 at a pressure
of 3 MPa, the reaction was conducted at 180 °C for a given time
(0.5–2 h). After the reaction, the mixture was filtered and
liquid products such as formic acid were quantified by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Both formic acid and glucose were
quantified by HPLC with the same
conditions as follows. HPLC analyses were performed with Waters ACQUITY
UPLC H-CLASS liquid chromatography system equipped with an RI detector.
The column was SHODEX SH1011. A mobile phase of 5 mM H2SO4 was used at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The temperatures
of column and RI detectors were 50 and 35 °C, respectively. The
injection volume was 10 μL. All of the experiments were conducted
in triplicate, and the provided data are the mean values of the repeated
experiments that had relative deviations below 3%.
