This
study reports on the unique water vapor adsorption properties
of biomass-derived starch particles (SPs). SPs offer an alternative
desiccant for air-to-air energy exchangers in heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning systems because of their remarkable adsorption–desorption
performance. SP15 has a particle diameter (dp) of 15 μm with a surface area (SA) of 2.89 m2/g and a pore width (Pw) of 80
Å. Microporous starch particles (SP15) were compared
with high amylose starch (HAS15; SA = 0.56 m2/g, dp = 15 μm, Pw = 46 Å) and silica gel (SG13; SA = 478
m2/g, dp = 13 μm, Pw = 62 Å). Transient water vapor tests
were performed using a customized small-scale energy exchanger coated
with SP15, HAS15, and SG13. The water
swelling (%) for SP15 was ca. 2 orders of magnitude greater
with markedly higher (ca. three- and six-fold) water vapor uptake
compared to HAS15 and SG13, respectively. At
similar desiccant coating levels on the energy exchanger, the latent
effectiveness of the SP15 system was much improved (4–31%)
over the HAS15 and SG13 systems at controlled
operating conditions. SP15 is a unique desiccant material
with high affinity for water vapor and superior adsorption properties
where ca. 98% regeneration was achieved under mild conditions. Therefore,
SPs display unique adsorption–desorption properties, herein
referred to as the “Goldilocks effect”. This contribution
reports on the utility of SPs as promising desiccant coatings in air-to-air
energy exchangers for ventilation systems or as advanced materials
for potential water/energy harvesting applications.

==== Body
Introduction
The demand for energy-efficient
buildings is rising because the
heating/cooling of commercial, residential, and industrial housing
accounts for ca. 30–50% of energy consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions in Canada1 and in the EU.2 In particular, the demand for cooling is expected
to increase almost exponentially (by ∼30-fold over this century)
because of climate change and increased energy needs for developing
countries.3 Several researchers4,5 have noted that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
systems equipped with air-to-air energy exchangers (AAEEs) can mitigate
the problems associated with massive energy intake. AAEE systems may
use an energy wheel that is a rotating wheel coated with a solid desiccant.
This type is the most common heat and moisture exchanger in HVAC systems
that constitute about 75% of the market. Although there are numerous
potential desiccants for energy wheels, only about 10 different desiccants
have been used commercially. The design of energy wheels allows the
transfer of a large portion of sensible (heat) and latent (moisture)
energy from the exhaust airstream.

The performance of energy
wheels is determined by its latent effectiveness,
which is the actual rate of moisture transfer between the supply and
exhaust airstreams as a function of the maximum possible rate of transfer
between streams.6 Extensive experimental
modeling and simulation data are available which outline the performance
and effectiveness of desiccant-coated wheels at variable operating
conditions.7−13 Few studies, as those reported by Simonson and Besant14−16 and others,17 have considered the role
of desiccant adsorption–desorption properties on the performance
of mineral-based desiccant-coated energy wheels. However, studies
related to the structure–function (adsorption–desorption)
relationship for desiccant materials relevant to AAEE applications
are scarce and contribute to a limited understanding of the performance
of such desiccant-coated wheels. The desiccant adsorption capacity,
along with the rate and the regeneration temperature play key roles
in the recovery of latent energy for hygroscopic wheels. Consequently,
recent research has focused on the development of sustainable desiccants
with enhanced properties such as adsorption capacity, regeneration
ability, and long-term stability. Starch-based adsorbents have suitable
properties as potential coatings for energy wheels owing to their
low cost, bioavailability, biodegradability, mechanical stability,
and easy disposal.17 Furthermore, starch
materials possess unique adsorption properties with high affinity
for water and organics in the liquid and gas phase.18,19 In general, studies on the performance of desiccants have traditionally
been carried out at equilibrium conditions, whereas moisture uptake/removal
for energy wheels is a transient process. More recently, Fathieh et
al.20 compared the performance of high
amylose starch (HAS15)- and silica gel (SG13)-coated wheels by performing transient tests using a small-scale
energy exchanger with comparable matrix geometry and coating configuration.
Conventional full-scale steady-state latent effectiveness test methods
on coated wheels are known21 but are often
limited because of time and financial constraints. The use of small-scale
transient testing methods address the difficulty and challenges associated
with the full-scale protocols while ensuring reliable results.

In this paper, carnation-based starch particles (SPs), hereafter
referred to as SP15, are introduced as a unique alternative
desiccant for energy wheel applications and are compared with results
for HAS15 and SG13 desiccants. Several objectives
are pursued in the current study (1) to introduce a modified desiccant
coating technique with sieving, (2) to compare the performance of
SP15 with other desiccants (HAS15 and SG13) onto coated wheels,20 and (3)
to further understand the structure–function relationship of
the desiccant systems. The surface and textural properties of the
desiccant materials were characterized by various techniques: spectroscopy,
microscopy, N2 adsorption isotherms, and particle size
distribution analysis. The adsorption–desorption properties
and latent effectiveness of the materials were further investigated
by swelling tests in water and vapor sorption/desorption with a small-scale
energy exchanger. This study presents a novel starch-based desiccant
(SP15) with unique vapor adsorption (dehumidification)
and desorption (regeneration) properties. SP15 has favorable
affinity with water vapor and greater uptake with a 98% regeneration
during the vapor desorption process. The interplay of adsorption–desorption
properties of the SP15 desiccant confers a unique “Goldilocks
effect”# for energy wheel applications.
The phenomena refers to the unique adsorption–desorption properties
of the desiccant that are optimal or “just right” for
AAEE systems and other water harvesting applications in arid environments.

Results
and Discussion
Physicochemical Properties of the Desiccants
The structure
of the SP15 was characterized using Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) and a particle size analyzer and compared with HAS15 and SG13 shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1a, the FT-IR spectra of the starch materials (SP15 and HAS15) show similar spectral bands at ca. 1081 cm–1 (C–H deformation), 1660 cm–1 (C–C stretching), 2940 cm–1 (C–H
stretching), and 3390 cm–1 (O–H stretching),
which is in agreement with another report.22 SP15 has a relatively narrow O–H stretching band
compared with HAS15, which may relate to crystallinity
differences due to greater amylopectin content (cf. Table S1). The IR band at ca. 1540 cm–1 for
SP15 may be due to lipid and protein constituents reported
elsewhere19 that result in minor spectral
variations. For SG13, two major peaks are shown at ca.
1109 and 810 cm–1 related to the Si–O–Si
asymmetric stretching and −O–H bending vibrations.23 The broader signal at ca. 3000–3600 cm–1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of the
silanol (Si–OH) groups.

Figure 1 (a) FT-IR and (b) particle size distribution
results for starch
particles (SP15). The results of SP15 are compared
with results of high amylose starch (HAS15) and silica
gel (SG13).20

The laser particle size analysis in Figure 1b shows the volume distribution
of the samples
with respect to the particle size, where the average particle diameters
(dp) for the three materials are similar
(13–15 μm; cf. Table 2). The bimodal distribution for SP15 and
SG13 at a greater particle size (≥100 μm)
is accounted for by particle aggregation via electrostatic interactions
due to their greater particle size distribution.

Experimental
adsorption isotherms using gaseous N2 in Figure 2 were used to estimate
the surface area (SA) and the average pore structure (diameter and
volume). The data are listed in Table 2. The isotherms of the starch (SP15 and
HAS15) and silica (SG13) differ markedly by
the profile of the adsorbed–desorbed N2. The starch
and silica materials generally display a type II behavior, according
to the IUPAC classification system.24 The
N2 gas uptake for SP15 and HAS15 are
low at each relative pressure (p/po) that concurs with a low porosity and SA. In contrast,
greater uptake of N2 occurs for SG13 where saturation
is attained at p/po ≈
0.8. The greater pore volume and SA of the mesoporous SG13 material relate to its rigid structure, and the steep increase in
N2 uptake (p/po > 0.6) by capillary condensation is consistent with its mesoporous
structure.25 The rigid nature of SG13 is contrasted against flexible starch materials that possess
a reduced SA and pore structure. The limited uptake of starch occurs
mainly on the outer surface of the powder grains at higher p/po (≈0.9) because of
its lower SA and reduced porosity. This is in contrast to SG13 and other porous materials such as metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs).26,27

Figure 2 N2 gas adsorption isotherms (at 77
K) for SP15, HAS15, and SG13.20 The insets show the schematic of the structures
of the materials.

The textural properties
and accessible surface functional groups
of porous materials can be assessed using different adsorptive probes
(N2/H2O).28 Polysaccharides
that contain polar functional groups may undergo swelling in water,
which is in contrast to the absence of such effects for N2 adsorption isotherm results. The relative swelling for SP15 and HAS13 was compared where the SP15 granules
are ca. 2 orders of magnitude greater than HAS15 (cf. Table 2). The difference
relates to the flexible and polar nature of SP15 and its
ability to undergo significant conformational change upon uptake of
water. Although SG13 has a greater accessible SA and pore
structure over SP15, its rigid structure limits the ability
to undergo extensive swelling of the rigid Si network relative to
starch.

The SEM images of SP15, HAS15,
and SG13 coated onto the Al-plates are shown in Figure 3. The SEM images
reveal a uniform
particle size distribution for HAS15 (Figure 3b). SP15 (Figure 3a, spherical particles
with smooth edges) and SG13 (Figure 3c, amorphous particles with sharp edges)
are characterized by a range of sizes because of potential aggregation,
which is in agreement with the particle size distribution analysis.
The SEM images of SP15-coated plate (sieving) and the HAS15-/SG13-coated plates (spray-coating) can be compared
for the two types of coating methods. In general, the sieving and
spray-coating techniques have advantages over conventional methods
for the HVAC industry:29 (1) uniform coating
is achieved, (2) the coating is monolayer, and (3) the desiccant particles
are surface-bound onto the acrylic adhesive substrate. The minor effect
of the particle bonding agent (see section S1.3) allows for maximum accessible desiccant adsorptive interactions.
In particular, the modified sieving method affords complete surface
coverage of the plate without any voids, which is in accordance with
the SEM results (cf. Figure 3a).

Transient Test Results
The transient response of the
small-scale coated exchangers is presented using a normalized humidity
ratio (W), as defined by eq 1. W is defined as the difference
in the exchanger outlet humidity ratio at any time (t) during the experiment divided by its maximum difference during
the step test. 1  w (kgwater-vapor/kgdry-air) in eq 1 is the air humidity ratio
(or air moisture content).
Detailed equations and models used to calculate the air humidity ratio
are presented in the supplementary data (section S2). The relative humidity (RH) and temperature variation at
the outlet of the small-scale exchanger during the humidification
(adsorption) and regeneration (desorption) tests is also presented
(Figure S2). For each exchanger, the breakthrough
response curves were obtained by normalizing the humidity ratios over
the testing period (cf. eq 1). The breakthrough curves for small-scale exchangers coated
with SP15, HAS15, and SG13 are shown
in Figure 4 for the
adsorption–desorption cycles. Note that the transient responses
for the humidity sensor and the noncoated plates (Al substrate and
the acrylic adhesive agent) for the small-scale exchanger were previously
reported (cf. Figure 9 ref (30)) by use of the hollow test cell after its step-wise humidity
changes as reported by Wang et al.31 The
findings of the control test demonstrated that the transient response
for both the bare Al-sheets and acrylic adhesive was nearly identical
to the humidity sensor and indicate that the aluminum (Al) plates
and adhesive have negligible water vapor sorption.

Figure 4 Breakthrough response
curves for small-scale exchangers for (a)
dehumidification (adsorption) and (b) regeneration (desorption) cycles,
at the operating conditions listed in Table S3.

Figure 4 shows that
the air humidity ratio (W) gradually increases/decreases
during the adsorption–desorption cycles, until it reaches the
humidity ratio of the inlet air. At the initial stages of the test,
the desiccant can adsorb–desorb all water vapor in the airflow,
where no apparent changes in the normalized humidity are observed.
This effect is more pronounced for the SP15 exchanger during
the dehumidification cycle (cf. Figure 4a), indicating that more moisture is adsorbed by this
material. Hence, better dehumidification is expected for the SP15 particles over HAS15 and SG13 accordingly.
By contrast, the regeneration process is rapid and occurs within a
few seconds for the three exchangers with the HAS15- and
SG13-coated desiccants showing improved performance (Figure 4b). On the basis
of the dehumidification profile, the SP15 exchanger likely
has greater relative moisture recovery among the desiccants studied.
A better comparison of the adsorption–desorption performance
of the three exchangers is possible on a specific basis (per unit
mass of the desiccant) analysis among the various materials.

Dehumidification
and Regeneration Results
The desiccant
mass-based adsorption (Ωads)–desorption (Ωdes) results were analyzed as detailed in the Supporting Information (section 2.4.2). The isotherms representing
the adsorption/dehumidification (Ωads) and desorption/regeneration
(Ωdes; mg water vapor/mg desiccant) of the three
exchangers are shown in Figure S3 and Table 1. The adsorption kinetics
are relatively fast, and equilibrium is attained within minutes, where
saturation occurs after the active sites become occupied. The Ωads for SP15 (0.152 mgwv/mgdes) shows ca. three- and six-fold greater moisture removal over HAS15 (0.052 mgwv/mgdes) and SG13 (0.026mgwv/mgdes) materials. Similarly, the
desorption level (Ωdes) increased by up to seven-fold
for the SP15 exchanger (cf. Table 1). Despite the lower N2 gas uptake
for the starch materials, greater moisture uptake is observed, especially
for SP15. The variable moisture uptake/removal cannot be
explained because of the textural (pore and SA) properties of the
materials solely. While SG13 has greater SA/pore volume
over the starches, the greater moisture uptake for the starch-based
desiccants relates to favored hydrogen bonding of adsorbed H2O with the polar functional groups (−OH) of starch and the
ability of SP15 to undergo conformational changes upon
adsorption of water vapor. Although silica gels have greater SA (up
to 800 m2/g)32 imparted by the
mesoporous framework, the lower adsorption capacity relates to less
abundant −OH groups and rigidity of the Si framework.33 Water vapor adsorption capacity values (∼0.25
mg water/mg MOF) were reported by Wang and Yaghi et al.26,34 for zirconium-based MOFs at 20% RH and 25 °C. The pore structure
(dp ≈ 0.0007 μm, Pv ≈ 0.45 cm3/g) and the permanent
SA (≈1000 m2/g) of the Zr-MOFs account for the high
water uptake. Seo et al.35 reported greater
values of 1.5–1.7 mg water/mg MOFs (SA ≈ 4150 m2/g) at 30–40 °C, while the regeneration occurred
at 70–80 °C and may not be practical for energy wheels.
Despite the limited textural properties and the absence of the permanent
SA for the microporous SPs reported herein, the abundant accessible
surface −OH groups account for the favorable adsorption. In
addition, more active sites and surface defects improve moisture adsorption
upon expansion of the SP15 network because of notable swelling
for such materials.36,37 It is noteworthy that the measured
water adsorption capacities for the samples herein may be underestimated,
as the materials were not fully evacuated at the start of the transient
adsorption cycle. For the sorption of SP15 versus HAS15, greater water swelling of SP15 has been reported.19 The swelling results are consistent with the
enhanced moisture uptake of SP15 compared to HAS15. In addition, the modified coating method via sieving may contribute
to improved moisture adsorption of the SP15 desiccant.
The coating method influences the particle textural properties and
accessibility of sorption sites because of the presence of fine versus
coarse particle grains.38 The favorable
water vapor uptake of SP15 concurs with the FT-IR and SEM
results, along with the pore filling theory,33 where micropore domains have greater affinity with water over mesopore
adsorption sites.

Table 1 Dehumidification/Adsorption (Ωads) and Regeneration/Dehumidification (Ωdes) Capacity Values in mg Water Vapor/mg Desiccant for the Various
Desiccant Materials

(mgwv/mgdes)	SP15	HAS15	SG13	Ωads (SP15)/Ωads (SG13)	Ωdes (SP15)/Ωdes (HAS15)

Ωdes	0.149	0.041	0.020	7.45	3.63	
The regeneration performance of a desiccant relates
to its utility
in hygroscopic wheels because of the multiple adsorption–desorption
processes required for energy wheels. SP15 has the highest
regeneration capacity (98%) compared to HAS15 (79%) and
SG13 (77%), as shown in Table 1 and Figure S3. A reduced regeneration performance of SG13 at 4% RH,
22.5 °C, and the specified flow rate relates to capillary condensation
within the pore network (Table S3). By
comparison, the reduced pore structure and the hydrophilic nature
of HAS15 account for its reduced desorption relative to
SP15. Li et al.25 reported that
the activation energy of desorption increased with the decreased pore
size. The pore size and volume of HAS15 is ca. 50% and
10-fold smaller than the corresponding values for SP15.
We conclude that the regeneration effectiveness of SP15 qualifies the material as a very promising desiccant for energy
wheels because less energy is required for regeneration, which is
in accordance with the hydration-driven allosterism of the SP15 desiccant material. In the current study, the heat of adsorption
(ΔHads; 44.2 ± 6.1 kJ/mol)/desorption
(ΔHads; 47.8 ± 7.9 kJ/mol)
was quantified (Table S4 and section S2.4.3). Whereas values of ΔH < 50 kJ/mol indicate a physisorption process,39 values of ΔHdes are slightly higher than ΔHads, which is consistent with the effects of capillary condensation
and/or cooperative effects.16,40 The given enthalpy
of adsorption is not too high and not too low but just right. As expected,
the moisture recovery (latent effectiveness) of the SP15 desiccant is significantly high, and this phenomenon is likened
to the “Goldilocks effect”.

Latent Effectiveness
The latent effectiveness (moisture
recovery ratio) of an energy wheel that would be constructed with
the desiccant-coated plates is determined from the breakthrough curves
(Figure 4). The method
involves fitting a double exponential model to the breakthrough curves
and predicting the number of mass transfer units (NTUm)
and effectiveness, as described by Fathieh et al.41 and also in section S2.4.4.
The latent effectiveness of the coated wheels was predicted for the
adsorption–desorption cycles at a flow rate of 15 L/min and
a face velocity of 0.05 m/s (Re = 26.2), and variable
angular speeds are shown in Figure 5. It is evident from Figure 5 that for the entire range of wheel angular
speed ω, the estimated latent effectiveness for the SP15-coated exchanger is generally higher relative to the latent effectiveness
of HAS15- and SG13-coated exchangers.

Figure 5 Latent effectiveness
of energy wheels estimated from the transient
characteristics of small-scale exchangers coated with SP15, HAS15, and SG13 particles at some specific
operating conditions: (a) dehumidification/adsorption cycle and (b)
regeneration/desorption cycle.

The increase of the latent effectiveness of the SP15 over HAS15 and SG13 (Figure S4a,b) reveals that the SP15-coated exchanger outperformed
the other exchangers at each angular speed (ω). At the typical
wheel speed (ω ≈ 0.1–0.5 rpm), the dehumidification
effectiveness of the SP15-coated exchanger was greater
relative to the other coated exchangers by ca. 18.9% (HAS15) and 31.3% (SP15). This clearly shows that SP15 can be used as an alternative desiccant for dehumidifier or desiccant
wheels with significantly improved performance. Similarly, at angular
speeds ω > 10, the effectiveness of SP15-coated
exchangers
was as high as 4.3 and 6.8% (dehumidification) and 4.2 and 5.7% (regeneration),
as compared with HAS15- and the SG13-coated
exchangers, respectively. The difference in latent effectiveness of
the SP15 exchanger during the dehumidification and regeneration
processes with corresponding uncertainties was evaluated (Figure S4c). At low angular speeds (ω ≈
0.5 rpm), the difference in latent effectiveness is large at 3.8%
with an uncertainty of 3.4%. For energy wheels with angular speeds
ω > 1.0 rpm, the difference in latent effectiveness was reduced
(ca. 2.6%) and was within the experimental uncertainty (ca. 3.0%)
estimated for the SP15-coated exchanger. The small difference
in latent effectiveness during the regeneration cycle at low angular
speeds may suggest that capillary condensation makes a partial contribution
to the adsorption of water at certain RH and temperature conditions
as described previously.20

Conclusions
The current study reports on the unique water vapor adsorption–desorption
for a biomass-derived starch particle (SP15) from the seed
of the Prairie carnation. This starch-based alternative desiccant
has significant potential as a sustainable coating in AAEE systems.
The surface and textural properties of the carnation-based starch
particles (SP15) in the dry state were comparable to high
amylose starch (HAS15) and silica gel (SG13).
The desiccant performance was characterized by using a small-scale
AAEE coated with desiccants to measure transient water vapor tests.
The moisture recovery (latent effectiveness) of the exchanger was
used to evaluate the desiccant performance for energy wheels. Despite
the similar textural properties for SG13 and SP15 by nitrogen adsorption results, the water vapor adsorption capacity
of SG13 was lower (Ωads = 0.026 mgwv/mgdes) relative to SP15 (Ωads = 0.152 mgwv/mgdes) and HAS15 (Ωads = 0.052 mgwv/mgdes).

The SP15-coated exchanger had ca. six-fold greater water
vapor adsorption over SG13. SP15 showed impressive
regeneration performance (98% at 24 °C) versus 79% (HAS15) and 77% (SG13). The significantly greater sorption performance
of the SP15-coated desiccant is related to the accessible
and abundant −OH active adsorption sites, unique water swelling
properties, and its particle morphology. The estimated latent effectiveness
for the SP15-coated exchanger was found to be notably greater
relative to the latent effectiveness for HAS15- and SG13-coated systems. The low energy required to regenerate the
SP15 desiccant material favors its use as an alternative
desiccant for energy wheel applications in HVAC systems with greater
performance over commercial silica materials. The impressive regeneration
performance for the adsorption–desorption of water vapor for
the SP materials is referred to as the “Goldilocks effect”.
The heat of adsorption and desorption are not too high, not too low,
but possibly just right for applications in AAEE and water harvesting
systems.42,43 The favorable vapor adsorption properties
of SP15 parallel those for MOFs that display notably high
proton conduction even at high humidity.44 Further research is underway to develop modified SP15 desiccant materials for industrial pilot scale testing and other
adsorption processes.

Experimental Methods and Materials
SP15 granules
(Canadian Carnation BioProducts Inc.) were obtained locally from the
seeds of the Prairie carnation plant. The physicochemical properties
of the materials are listed in Table 2 and compared with
corn-based high amylose starch (HAS15) and silica gel (SG13) (Sigma-Aldrich Canada). Details on the preparation and
additional properties are given in the supporting information (section S1.1 and Table S1).

Characterization of the Materials
Several methods were
used to assess the surface and textural properties of the desiccants:
particle size distribution analyzer (PSA Malvern instruments), FT-IR
(Bio-Rad FTS-40), SEM (FEG-SEM SU 6600 Instruments), N2 adsorption (Micrometrics ASAP 2020), and solvent swelling (gravimetric
tests). The experimental details are given in section S1.2.

Small-Scale Exchanger
Because of
the financial and
operational demands of building a full-scale energy wheel with a new
desiccant, a small-scale exchanger was built to study the transient
vapor adsorption/desorption properties of the SP15 desiccant.
Details of the SP15-coated small-scale exchanger are presented
in section S2.1 and elsewhere.20 The exchanger consists of 16 parallel aluminum
(Al-3003) plates (200 ± 0.5 mm by 80 ± 0.5 mm; 30.8396 ±
0.0001 g by weight) (Table S2) coated with
the desiccant (e.g., SP15, HAS15, or SG13) on each side. The 16 parallel Al-plates yield 15 flow channels,
with dimensions as illustrated in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Schematic presentation
of a small-scale energy exchanger.

A unique sieving method was modified from a previously reported
spray coating technique20 to cover the
SP15 desiccant onto the Al-substrate. The sieving method
avoids the use of a high-pressure pneumatic spray gun that led to
nonuniform dispersion of SP15 particles because of sticking
and aggregation. The coating method has several stages: (1) a thin
layer of aerosol adhesive (3M super 77) was evenly sprayed over the
metal plate, (2) a thin (0.035 mm) annealed Al-foil tape (3M 3381)
backing with a thin acrylic adhesive was attached to the substrate
from the nonadhesive side. The Al-foil tape creates a barrier against
extreme moisture conditions: −23 to 49 °C and 0–95%
RH,20 (3) the solid desiccant was sieved
over the exposed adhesive side of the foil using a series 120 mesh
screen, and the coating was gently pressed to enable surface binding,
and (4) the loosely bound particles were removed using pressurized
dry air to achieve a coating thickness and level listed in Table 3. The mass of coated
desiccant per unit plate area (mg/cm2) for the three small-scale
exchangers is within the acceptable industry level range.20 The coating methods are detailed in the Supporting Information (section S1.3).

Transient Test Facility
A lab-scale transient test
facility (Figure S1) was developed to allow
the stationary desiccant-coated energy exchangers to sudden changes
in the inlet humidity.30 The small-scale
coated exchanger was placed vertically into the test cell within the
transient test facility, as detailed in the Supporting Information (section S2.2). To perform the single-step transient
tests, dry and humid airstreams were introduced, as listed in Table S3, and a step-wise procedure was followed
(section S2.3). The first step was preconditioning,
where dry air (∼2% RH) at ∼24 °C (Table S3) was passed through the exchanger to dry the desiccant
before each adsorption cycle. Similar preconditioning with humid air
(∼43% RH) at 24 °C occurred before each desorption cycle.
Further details of the transient test facility are presented in section S2.
