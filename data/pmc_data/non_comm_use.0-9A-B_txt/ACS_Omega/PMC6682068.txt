Leaching of chemicals from adhesion
promoters is, in particular,
problematic for the food, water, pharmaceutical, and MedTech industries
where any chemical contamination is unacceptable. A solution to this
issue is to employ covalently attached nanoscale polymer brushes as
adhesive layers for plastics. One of the industrially most relevant
adhesion targets in that respect is poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS),
being used for many high-end applications such as catheters and breast
implants. In this work, we have synthesized a novel surface-immobilized
poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-based brush adhesive containing
reactive hydrosilane groups that can bond directly to PDMS. Two different
medical grades of addition-cured PDMS were molded on top of titanium
substrates already coated with the polymer brush. Titanium plates
were used for the chemical analysis, and titanium rods were used for
adhesion testing. Adhesion testing revealed a high adhesive force,
in which cohesive failure was observed in the bulk PDMS. The necessity
of the hydrosilane group in the polymer brush adhesive layer was demonstrated
in comparative studies using similar brushes lacking this functionality.

Introduction
Adhesion of plastics to metals, ceramics,
glass, and other polymers
using glues is often problematic due to leaching of chemicals from
glues over time.1 Nanoscale polymer chains
end-tethered to a surface, so-called polymer brushes, have attracted
much attention in the last two decades due to the strong mode of attachment,
usually covalent, to the surface, the nanometer scale, and the possibility
to tune the chemical features.2,3 Polymer brushes can
provide a surface with properties such as wetting,4−7 adhesion,8,9 biocompatibility,10−12 antifouling,13−15 and corrosion resistance.16−18 Hence, designing
polymer brushes with new chemical structures has the potential to
bring new surface properties to materials.

The use of polymer
brushes as nanoscale adhesive layers has been
addressed from both academic and industrial points of view.19 In particular, the adhesion of plastic promoted
by polymer brushes has had a strong focus.8,20,21 In one such study, a 43-nm-thick polymer
brush layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was used as the adhesive
layer for bonding to bulk PMMA.8 It was
shown that the adhesion was sufficiently strong to yield cohesive
failure in the bulk PMMA. Nanoentanglement was suggested to be the
nature of adhesion between the PMMA polymer brush chains and the polymer
chains of the bulk PMMA. This means that polymer brush adhesion requires
tailor-made brushes that are chemically compatible with the plastic
in question. On top of this, chemical bonds can be established in
the entangled polymer matrix by introducing specific reactive chemical
groups in the brush part.

The potential industrial applications
of polymer brushes are immense,
considering the low material consumption (<100-nm-thick adhesive
layers), the high stability of the surface anchoring points providing
a long shelf life, and the avoidance of the chemicals usually added
to induce covalent bond formation. In particular, the absence of hazardous
chemicals is germane for the food, water, pharmaceutical, and MedTech
industries to diminish as much as possible the risk of chemicals leaching
to the surroundings over time. For such reasons, further development
of polymer brush systems with the aim of matching them up chemically
with relevant plastic materials
is crucial.

In this work, we report the design and testing of
a novel polymer
brush layer for adhesion to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). PDMS is
used extensively by the MedTech industry, e.g., as catheters, medicine
pumps, and percutaneous implants.22 By
introducing hydrosilane groups in the polymer brush structure based
on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and by exploiting their
ability to react during the Pt-catalyzed curing process of the PDMS,
it becomes possible to establish covalent bonding between the brush
and the PDMS.23,24 Adhesion testing is performed
for two medical grades of PDMS to show that the failure, once induced,
is fully cohesive. Finally, it is shown that the hydrosilane group
is pertinent for the successful outcome of this process since adhesion
becomes significantly weaker upon replacing Si–H with a Si–Me
group.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Functional Polymer Brushes
Scheme 1 summarizes
the synthesis protocol
for designing polymer brushes having the appropriate chemical properties
to make them compatible with a PDMS bulk polymer. The steps involved
in the synthesis of the functional polymer brushes are the following
(see Experimental Section): (1) silane grafting
onto the surface using (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS), followed
by annealing to promote cross-linking, to yield TiAPTMS;25 (2) the polymerization initiator,
Tiinitiator, is obtained by reacting TiAPTMS with α-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BiBB);26 (3) the TiPHEMA polymer brushes with their reactive
hydroxyl groups are fabricated using the protocol for activators regenerated
by electron transfer for atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET
ATRP) in a protic polar solvent system;27−29 and (4) TiDMS and TiTMS with their pendant dimethylsilane or trimethylsilane
functionalities are obtained by reacting TiPHEMA with the
pertinent chlorosilanes.30,31

Scheme 1 Steps Involved in
the Synthesis of Polymer Brush Structures
(1)
Silane grafting using APTMS,
(2) synthesis of the radical initiator using BiBB, (3) ARGET ATRP
of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and (4) introduction of two
different kinds of silyl groups.

The hydrosilane
group in TiDMS is selected because of
its ability to react with the vinyl group in the PDMS during the curing
process. In this manner, an interfacial cross-bonding network can
be established to strengthen the adhesion. In contrast, the TMS-terminated
polymer brushes in TiTMS, although being similar in the
overall chemical structure, are disclosed from being involved in this
type of reactions. Depending on the ability of the brushes to mix
with the PDMS polymer, nanoentanglement may occur with the expectation
that the TiDMS and TiTMS samples would entangle
equally well with PDMS.

Table 1 shows the
thicknesses and the atomic composition (atom %) for the Ti samples
obtained at the various synthesis steps (Scheme 1). For Tiblank, the ratio of Ti
(21.2 atom %) and O (45.1 atom %) is close to 1:2 as expected for
a TiO2 surface. This is accompanied by the presence of
a substantial amount of adventitious C (27.6 atom %) and some N (3.5
atom %), the latter, most likely, originating from the physical vapor
deposition fabrication process of the Ti substrates. The TiAPTMS sample contains a slightly higher N content (3.8 atom %), which
can be attributed to the introduction of the amine group. In addition,
Si (1.9 atom %) is observed in accordance with expectations. The value
of d = 1.1 ± 0.4 nm is consistent with 1–3
layers of APTMS, considering that the molecular length of ATPMS is
∼0.5 nm (determined from a MM2 molecular dynamics energy minimization
using the Chem3D software with the following parameters: step interval,
2 fs; frame interval, 10 fs; heating/cooling rate, 1.000 kcal atom–1 ps–1; and target temperature, 300
K). Substantial amounts of Ti, O, and C are still detected to bear
witness of the low thickness of the APTMS coating.

a For Tiblank, TiAPTMS, Tiinitiator, and TiPHEMA, the amount of other
elements (i.e., Na, Ca, Co, and Zn) detected is <3 atom %. For
TiDMS and TiTMS, the amount of these other elements
is <0.5 atom %.

Going
to Tiinitiator, the prominent features are 0.7
atom % of Br and the increase in C content by 3.3 atom %, which verify
the successful introduction of Br from the reaction with BiBB. The
increase in the content of Si from 1.9 to 3.9 atom % is unexpected
and may originate from glassware contaminants. The film thickness
(d = 0.9 ± 0.4 nm) is within the uncertainty
of the TiAPTMS sample thickness, which is expected considering
the small size of the added initiator group. After the polymerization
of HEMA using ARGET ATRP, the corresponding TiPHEMA samples
show a large increase in the film thickness (d =
52 ± 6 nm), in line with the growth of polymer brushes. Furthermore,
C and O from the PHEMA part are the only ones seen, arriving in, by
and large, the expected 2:1 ratio. Ti, N, and Si are no longer detectable
because the XPS probing depth is only ∼10 nm.

Upon reaction
with chlorodimethylsilane, TiPHEMA is
converted into TiDMS as evidenced from the presence of
6.5 atom % Si. For a full conversion, the Si/O ratio should theoretically
be 1:3, while the experimental value is closer to 1:4. This indicates
that ∼75% of the pendant hydroxyl groups in the polymer brush
have reacted, which also is reflected in the significant thickness
increase by 11 nm to now d = 63 ± 7 nm. In comparison,
the corresponding conversion using chlorotrimethylsilane to give TiTMS provides 4.9 atom % Si (∼60% functionalization)
and a thickness increase by 13 nm to d = 65 ±
4 nm. The larger thickness increase is expected for TiTMS considering the presence of an extra methyl group compared to that
of TiDMS, although the high uncertainties associated with
the measurements make it difficult to use the results in a more quantitative
manner. In summary, the XPS and ellipsometry data confirm the steps
in the synthesis protocol.

Adhesion Tests
Figures 1 and 2 show the maximum adhesive
force and percentage of cohesive failure obtained for the Tiblank, TiDMS, and TiTMS samples molded with two
different medical grades of PDMS, i.e., MED-4420 and MED-6215 (see
the Experimental Section). We chose not to
normalize the measured adhesive force with the area, although the
contact surface area between the rod and the PDMS was known (∼3
cm2). Such numbers would not be representative of the actual
tensile strength due to the geometry of the setup, where a combination
of adhesion, shear, and tear strengths comes into play. Measurement
of the tensile strength is often done by a classical peel test, but
soft PDMS substrates are known to be notoriously difficult to perform
this kind of test, and given that the purpose here is merely to compare
the adhesive properties we choose not to do so. The percentage of
cohesive failure was evaluated visually by estimating the fraction
of the Ti surface still covered with remains of PDMS after failure.
A sample molded with the commercially available PDMS primer MED1-161
(denoted TiMED1-161) served as a reference.

Figure 1 Adhesion test

adhesive force (blue) and the percentage of cohesive failure (red
solid square).

Figure 2 Adhesion test for Ti
samples molded with MED-6215 showing the maximum
adhesive force (blue) and the percentage of cohesive failure (red
solid square).

For Tiblank with both MED-4420 and MED-6215, the adhesive
force is low (<80 N) and no cohesive failure is observed at all.
In contrast, both the commercially available primer MED1-161 and the
TiDMS show 100% cohesive failure with, by and large, the
same maximum adhesive force. At 100% cohesive failure, the strength
of the PDMS alone determines the maximum adhesive force required for
failure. It is worth noting that the adhesive force measured for MED-4420
(∼250 N) is almost twice that for the softer MED-6215 (∼130
N).

In the case of the TiTMS samples, the percentage
of
cohesive failure is significantly lower (≤20%), while the adhesive
force is higher than that for Tiblank but smaller than
that for TiMED1-161 and TiDMS. To better
understand these results, three adhesion components should be considered,
i.e., physisorption (wetting), entanglement, and covalent bonding.
The Tiblank sample can only provide adhesion by physisorption
of the PDMS, while TiTMS provides additional adhesion by
entanglement of the TMS brushes with PDMS. This contributes to the
improved strength in the latter case. Only TiDMS allows
all three components of adhesive forces, including the covalent bonding
obtained during the curing reaction of PDMS (Scheme 2). This explains the remarkably enhancement
in the strength of the interface for TiDMS.

Conclusions
In this study, we have introduced a novel
PHEMA brush postmodified
with a hydrosilane (i.e., DMS) moiety. We show that this system is
able to promote strong adhesion to two different medical grades of
addition-cured PDMS showing full cohesive failure. Replacing the hydrosilane
hydrogen atom with a methyl group (i.e., TMS) results in a markedly
lower adhesive force to PDMS with a significantly larger degree of
adhesive failure. These results are explained by the ability of the
DMS-modified PHEMA brushes to participate in the PDMS curing reactions,
thus affording covalent bonding between the DMS brushes and the bulk
PDMS. The fact that TMS-modified PHEMA brushes show a lower adhesion
than that of the DMS-based brushes but, nevertheless, a higher adhesion
force than that of a blank sample without brushes suggests that both
the modified polymer brushes experience nanoentanglement with PDMS.
Importantly, this study shows that a nm-thin DMS-derived PHEMA brush
system yields the adhesion of a size, similar to that accomplished
with a 1–5-μm-thick commercial primer. We believe that
such polymeric adhesive systems will have a promising future in the
MedTech and similar industries having strict requirements to evade
leaking of chemical agents.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
unless otherwise stated. Acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), methanol
(MeOH), isopropanol, acetonitrile (MeCN), diethyl ether, and pentane
were all high-performance liquid chromatography-grade and purchased
from Th. Geyer. 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA, 97%) was purified
by passing it through a column of Al2O3 to remove
the inhibitor. CuCl2·2H2O (>99%), (+)-sodium l-ascorbate (NaAsc, >98%), 2,2′-bipyridine (BiPy,
>99%),
triethylamine (TEA, >99%), α-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BiBB,
98%), 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, >99%), chlorodimethylsilane
(DMS-Cl, 98%), and chlorotrimethylsilane (TMS-Cl, >98%) were used
as received. (3-Aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS, 97%) was obtained
from FluoroChem. Cylindrical rods (L = 50 mm, d = 5 mm) of Ti–6Al–4V were supplied by Elos
MedTech Pinol A/S. Ti plates (TiO2 on SiO2 wafer;
1 cm × 1 cm) were produced by the Danish Technological Institute
using physical vapor deposition. The two medical grades of PDMS (MED-6216
and MED-4420) and the PDMS primer (MED1-161) were purchased from NuSil.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS analysis
on the plates was performed with a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD instrument
equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source at 150 W. The pressure in
the chamber was kept below 5 × 10–9 mbar during
measurements. Survey scans were obtained with a pass energy of 160
eV from 0 to 1400 eV and accumulated for two scans. High-resolution
spectra were recorded using a 20 eV pass energy and by accumulating
four scans. CasaXPS software was used for data analysis, where C 1s
= 285.0 eV was set as calibration for the binding energy. All peaks
were integrated using a Shirley background.

Ellipsometry
The
thicknesses of the dry-state surface
layers on the plates were measured using a rotating analyzer ellipsometer
(Dre, Germany). The samples were measured at an angle of incident
at 75°. Parameters of the bare (Δ0, Ψ0) and modified (Δm, Ψm)
substrates were measured at ambient temperature in air, where Δ
is the phase shift and tan Ψ is the amplitude ratio of
reflection. The complex part of the reflective index of the bare substrate
was calculated from the Δ0 and Ψ0 values. A three-layer optical model with the substrate with its
complex refractive index, the surface layers with their refractive
index and thickness, and the surrounding air was used to get the overall
coefficients for in-plane (Rp)- and out-of-plane
(Rs)-polarized lights. The real and imaginary
parts of the refractive index of each substrate were obtained using
clean substrates prior to surface modification. The refractive index
of the organic surface layers was set at constant values (1.55 and
0 for the real and imaginary parts, respectively). The thickness and
standard deviation reported originate from minimum three spots measured
on each sample.

Adhesion Testing of PDMS-Molded Samples
An AG-10 apparatus
from Shimadzu KK was used for adhesion testing, where the Ti rods
were pulled upward (2 mm min–1) while holding the
PDMS in place with a fixture (Figure 3). The force applied was measured as a function of
the distance traveled by the rod. As the rod is pulled upward, the
PDMS is under both elastic strain and compression until either an
adhesive or a cohesive breakage occurs. The degree of cohesive and
adhesive failure was subsequently evaluated visually by looking at
the amount of PDMS that remains on the surface of the Ti rod after
failure. We report the adhesive force for the maximum force calculated
as the mean of at least three tests. The contact surface area between
the rod and the PDMS is the same for all samples (∼3 cm2).

of the locking posture, (C) load sample that is ready for adhesion
testing, and finally, the apparatus setup (D) before and (E) after
testing.

Molding of PDMS onto Ti
Rods
MED-4420- and MED-6215-type
PDMS were molded in a PTFE mold with the Ti rod positioned in the
middle of the mold. Both types consisted of two components that should
be hand-mixed in the ratio 1:1 for MED-4420 and 10:1 for MED-6215
for 5 min before it was vacuum-treated for 10 min to remove entrapped
air bubbles and then poured into the mold. The sample was cured at
165 °C for 20 min and left in the mold to cool down to room temperature.

Synthesis Protocol for Sample Preparation
Scheme 1 summarizes the synthesis
protocol employed for producing polymer brushes on the Ti plates/rods
with the individual steps as listed as follows.

Silane Grafting
on Ti Samples
Ti items (denoted Tiblank) were
sonicated for 10 min in deionized water, then in
acetone and, finally, in pentane. Each item was placed in 12 mL of
solution taken from a standard solution of APTMS (1.05 mL) in MeOH
(300 mL). After heating to 60 °C, the samples were left to react
for 3 h without stirring. The samples (denoted TiAPTMS)
were then flushed with MeOH and annealed at 120 °C for 1 h.

Synthesis of the Initiator
A solution of DCM (240 mL),
TEA (16.5 mL), and BiBB (14.7 mL) was prepared and distributed into
several test tubes (10 mL), each containing one TiAPTMS sample. The samples were left at 0 °C on a shaking table (80
rpm) for 3 h. After the reaction, the samples (denoted Tiinitiator) were sonicated for 10 min in DCM and acetone, respectively.

Activators
Regenerated by Electron Transfer for Atom Transfer
Radical Polymerization (ARGET ATRP) of the HEMA Monomer to Produce
Brushes
A solution of deionized water (40 mL), MeOH (40 mL),
and HEMA (12.3 mL) in a 100 mL chemical reactor was purged with argon
for 15 min and then mixed with CuCl2·2H2O (64.0 mg), BiPy (117.5 mg), and NaAsc (79.1 mg). The solution was
cooled to 0 °C and purged with argon for additional 15 min. The
Tiinitiator samples hanging from a lid were introduced
to the solution and polymerized under heavy stirring and continuous
argon purging for 4 h. After the polymerization, the samples were
sonicated in acetone for 10 min. A distinct surface layer of PHEMA
was visible on the samples (denoted TiPHEMA).

Reaction of
Polymer Brushes with DMS-Cl
The TiPHEMA samples
were submerged in a solution consisting of dry
DCM (90 mL), DMAP (24.8 mg), DMS-Cl (1.02 mL), and TEA (1.125 mL)
in an argon-purged 100 mL chemical reactor. The samples were left
overnight under stirring at 0 °C. After the reaction, the samples
(denoted TiDMS) were sonicated 10 min in acetone followed
by further flushing in acetone.

Reaction of Polymer Brushes
with TMS-Cl
The TiPHEMA samples were submerged
in a solution consisting of dry
DCM (90 mL), DMAP (24.8 mg), TMS-Cl (1.02 mL), and TEA (1.125 mL)
in an argon-purged 100 mL chemical reactor. The samples were left
overnight under stirring at 0 °C. After the reaction, the samples
(denoted TiTMS) were sonicated 10 min in acetone followed
by further flushing in acetone.
