Phenylalanine-arginine β-naphthylamide
(PAβN) is a
broad-spectrum efflux pump inhibitor that has shown to potentiate
the activity of antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. AdeB is a part
of the AdeABC tripartite pump that plays a pivotal role in conferring
efflux-mediated resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii. To understand the molecular mechanism of efflux pump inhibition
by PAβN, we investigated the interaction of PAβN with
AdeB using different computational methods. We observed that PAβN
does not have specific binding interactions with the proximal binding
site and interacts strongly with the distal binding pocket. The Phe
loop located between the proximal and distal binding pockets plays
a key role in the PAβN-mediated inhibition and acts as a gate
between the binding pockets. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested
that PAβN behaved like a climber as we observed switching of
the interaction energies between the ligand and the key Phe residues
of the binding site during the course of the simulation. PAβN
uses the hydrophobic microenvironment formed by Phe residues in the
distal binding pocket to keep the binding monomer in the binding conformation.
The simulation data suggests that this binding event should result
in the inhibition of the peristaltic mechanism and prevent the exporter
from extruding any other substrates leading to the inhibition of the
tripartite pump.

1 Introduction
Multidrug-resistant
(MDR) bacteria have emerged as a major concern
for public health, and there are particular concerns about the emergence
of a number of Gram-negative pathogens, for which there are dwindling
treatment options and few compounds are in development. These pathogens
are characterized by the ability to rapidly develop and acquire resistance
mechanisms in response to exposure to different antimicrobial agents.
A key part of the armory of these pathogens is a series of efflux
pumps, which effectively exclude or reduce the intracellular concentration
of a large number of antibiotics and other compounds, making the pathogens
significantly more resistant. These efflux pumps are a topic of considerable
interest, both from the perspective of understanding efflux pump function
and also as targets for novel adjunct therapies.

Resistance-nodulation-division
(RND) multidrug efflux pumps are
tripartite systems, situated in the three-layer (outer membrane, periplasmic
space, and inner membrane) envelope of Gram-negative bacteria,1 consisting of an outer membrane protein (OMP)
or channel such as AdeC, TolC, or OprM; a fusion or accessory protein
such as AdeA, AcrA, or MexA, which is located in the periplasmic space;
and an inner membrane protein or transporter such as AdeB, AcrB, or
MexB, which is located in the bacterial inner membrane.2,3 Each of the three components of tripartite efflux pumps assembles
as a homotrimer.4−6

The molecular structure of the inner membrane
protein is composed
of three regions: (i) periplasmic regions, including porter and docking
domains (PN1, PN2, and DN) in its N-terminal and also porter and docking
domains (PC1, PC2, and DC) in the C-terminal; (ii) pore regions; and
(iii) transmembrane (TM) regions4−6 (Figure 1). Four subdomains of PN1, PN2, PC1, and
PC2 pack to form two proximal and distal substrate-binding pockets,
which are separated by a switch glycine-rich loop, a part of PC1 with
a Phe residue at the tip, namely, a G-loop or a Phe loop. The Phe
loop controls the access of substrates to the distal pocket by forming
a boundary between the proximal and distal binding pockets.7 Under the Phe loop, there is a narrow channel
that connects the proximal and distal pockets to each other. The pockets
are enriched in aromatic, polar, and charged amino acid residues that
form favorable interactions with the transported substrates. The proximal
and distal pockets show substrate preferences and can associate with
different antibiotics including β-lactams.8−10

of the AdeB efflux pump transporter from Acinetobacter
baumannii. It represents the structure
that was obtained after carrying out homology modeling, minimization,
and equilibration. The full-space complete homotrimer structure of
AdeB has been shown on the right side of the picture, and each subunit
has been represented by different colors. The side view of the binding
conformer has been shown on the left side of the picture. In addition,
two top views of the docking (D) and pore (P) domains have been represented
in the middle of the picture. The DC (C-terminal) and DN (N-terminal)
subdomains of the docking section have been indicated by the top view
in the top middle panel, and the PN1, PN2, PC1, and PC2 subdomains
of the pore section have been indicated in the bottom middle picture
with a 2 times magnification over the others. PAβN has been
shown in the binding domain.

The monomers of the inner membrane protein can adopt three
different
states: access (loose), binding (tight), and extrude (release) to
provide essential dynamics for the efflux.4,9,11 Structures with bound drugs revealed two
discrete multisite binding pockets separated by a switch loop, with
the distal pocket in the binding (tight) state and the proximal pocket
in the access (loose) state.8,9

Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative
bacillus that causes numerous healthcare-associated infections worldwide,
with a propensity for nosocomial transmission.12 Reports have demonstrated the involvement of both intrinsic
and acquired resistance determinants, as well as efflux pumps, in
conferring multidrug resistance.13 Several
efflux pumps were identified and shown to be associated with multidrug
efflux prior to the sequencing of the A. baumannii genome;3−5 for example, efflux pumps adeABC, abeM, adeDE, and
adeXY have been identified in A. baumannii through genetic analysis.4,7,8,14 The overexpression of the adeABC
pumps has been experimentally associated with the multidrug resistance
phenotype in clinical isolates of A. baumannii.(9−11) In contrast, other transporter components such as adeIJK, adeFGH,
and adeT were identified initially through genome analysis12 and have only recently been shown to play a
role in either intrinsic (adeIJK) or inducible drug resistance (adeFGH).15

Efflux pump system AdeABC was identified
in a MDR A. baumannii strain in 2001.1 In A. baumannii, AdeB is the multidrug
transporter protein, AdeA is the membrane fusion protein, and AdeC
is the OMP.1 The efflux transporter (AdeB),
as an inner membrane protein of tripartite efflux pumps like AcrD,16 captures its substrates either from within the
phospholipid bilayer of the inner membrane or from the cytoplasm and
then transports them into the extracellular medium via the OMP (AdeC).
Periplasmic protein AdeA mediates the cooperation between the AdeB
and AdeC components. Drug transport by AdeB is driven by the TM electrochemical
gradient of protons. As a member of the RND family, AdeABC efflux
pumps are proton antiporters and exchange H+ ions for drugs.17,18 The overexpression of this system plays a pivotal role in efflux-mediated
resistance in clinical isolates19,20 and reduces the antimicrobial
efficacy of a broad spectrum of antimicrobials including aminoglycosides,
tetracyclines, erythromycin, chloramphenicol (CHL), trimethoprim,
fluoroquinolones, some β-lactams,1,21−23 and tigecycline.24,25

Phenylalanyl arginyl β-naphthylamide
(PAβN) (Figure 2), one of the best-studied
efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), is a widely used EPI that has been
reported as a substrate for the MexAB–OprM pumps26 and AcrAB-TolC that follows a sigmoidal kinetics27 and is also shown to inhibit efflux of antibiotics24,28 and biocides29,30 in A. baumannii. PAβN has been studied in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria,
including A. baumannii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Campylobacter jejuni,26,31−34 and has shown to potentiate the activity of different antibiotics
through its effect on a wide range of efflux pumps. Mechanistically,
PAβN acts as a competitive inhibitor and prevents efflux of
the antibiotics by binding with the substrate-binding pocket of the
efflux pumps, which leads to potentiation of their activities.35−39 Alternatively, because of a close location of the binding site,
EPI binding may also generate steric hindrance, impairing antibiotic
binding at its affinity site. PAβN has shown to inhibit AcrAB-TolC
in K. pneumoniae, Escherichia
coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and E. aerogenes(31,33,39,40) and multiple
homologous systems including AdeFGH and AdeABC in A.
baumannii(41,42) and CmeABC in C. jejuni and Campylobacter coli.43,44

β-naphthylamide (PAβN).

Agents that inhibit the tripartite efflux pump systems can
play
a key role in reviving antibiotics to which bacteria have become resistant.18,45−50 Understanding how the transport process operates within the tripartite
systems requires information on the organization and interaction of
the subunits within a full tripartite assembly. Reconstituting tripartite
assemblies for experimental structural elucidation has been a technical
challenge, and simply mixing the components together does not yield
the assembled complexes in sufficient yield or purity to enable analysis.51 With the help of the available structural data,
computational tools can be used to generate reliable models of these
tripartite pumps and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide
detailed atomic-level information between EPIs and tripartite systems
and help the researchers to understand the molecular mechanism of
EPIs. This information is essential for designing new classes of EPIs
with a better target affinity and desired EPI activity for clinical
development.

In this study, for the first time, the interaction
of PAβN
with the binding monomer of A. baumannii AdeB homotrimer has been studied computationally. The data on the
direct inhibition of AdeABC by PAβN appear to be contradictory.
A number of studies have shown a clear effect of deletions in the
components of the AdeABC pump, giving rise to a >4-fold increase
in
susceptibility to antibiotics such as GEN, ciprofloxacin (CIP), and
tigeycline (e.g., Richmond’s work),52 but the studies have not been able to replicate this effect using
PAβN (ref (41) and Sutton et al., unpublished) with only a very limited reduction
in gentamicin (GEN) susceptibility observed in some cases. Conversely,
PAβN does have a clear effect on the susceptibility to rifampicin
and clarithromycin in A. baumannii,
but the minimum inhibitory concentration of these antibiotics is apparently
unaffected by knockout mutants or transposon insertions in adeABC (Sutton et al., unpublished).

Although molecular
interaction of PAβN or other broad-spectrum
EPIs with AdeB has not been studied to date, Vargiu and Nikaido7 studied AcrB from E. coli, which is a similar efflux pump to AdeB by MD. A sequence alignment
study reveals considerable differences (overall sequence identity
50.36%) between the positions of the critical amino residues (Figure S1 and Table S1) within the binding sites
of the two pumps. Therefore, the interaction of EPIs with the binding
sites of these transporters can vary, which in turn can affect the
ability of these inhibitors to potentially block the pump. In addition
to AdeB, there are other efflux pumps that also contribute to the
MDR phenotype in A. baumannii; there
is clear evidence that AdeB, as part of the AdeABC tripartite pump,
is one of the most important systems. This is in terms of both the
range of antibiotic classes that are potential substrates (e.g., mediating
clinical resistance to all aminoglycosides]15 and the distribution of the efflux pump in MDR clinical isolates;
prevalence approaches 100% in many clinically important lineages.53−55 AdeB is a clinically important representative of the RND family
of multidrug transporters in A. baumannii, and as such, the molecular mechanism of interaction of this pump
with PAβN will provide useful new information to understand
the substrate specificity of EPIs and balance the seemingly contradictory
results seen for PAβN inhibition in A. baumannii. This information could then be used to design improved compounds
that alone or in combination with antibiotics can block these MDR
exporters and potentially sensitize resistant pathogens.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Binding Site
According
to the Smina
molecular docking results, the location for binding of PAβN
to the protein structure was identified in the multisite binding pocket
within the binding protomer of the transporter (Figure 3). The docked complex of PAβN–AdeB
was comparable to the previous structures determined for ligand-bound
AcrB by Nakashima et al.8 Only one PAβN
was bound to the binding monomer of the homotrimer, and it was bound
only to the multibinding site. Also, other favorable docked poses
showed that PAβN could bind to the access monomer of the AdeB
homotrimer, which suggests that PAβN could be forced to pass
through the path, during the dynamic of the efflux process, by a transient
conformational change from the access form to the binding form and
PAβN would move to the gate of the distal pocket in the binding
state. There were strong hydrophobic interactions between PAβN
and Phe612 of AdeB that is located at the tip of the hairpin-like
loop and forms a partition between the proximal and distal binding
pockets at the top of the channel between the two pockets.

Figure 3 (a) Homotrimer

of the trimer has been shown in a different color; the best binding
site in the binding monomer determined by Smina molecular docking
somewhere close to the distal pocket that has been represented by
a black circle. (b) PAβN in the multibinding sites within the
binding protomer of the AdeB transporter.

PAβN was found to bind to the narrow channel under
Phe loop
and partly in the distal binding site of AdeB after molecular docking
(Figure 3b). The energy
of binding, which corresponds to the affinity of the first pose (the
best pose), obtained by the molecular docking of PAβN to the
AdeB transporter showed that PAβN could associate to the multisite
binding pocket with favorable affinity. Molecular modeling studies
provided insight into the possible reason why PAβN could increase
the susceptibility of certain antibiotics while has little effect
against other antibiotics. To explore this further, we selected four
antibiotics GEN, CHL, CIP, and levofloxacin (LEV) that are known substrates
of AdeB. PAβN has shown to potentiate the activity of LEV in P. aeruginosa but has little effect on other three
antibiotics. A blind molecular docking study was carried out to compare
the binding site of these four antibiotics with that of PAβN.
The best pose of GEN binds to the proximal binding pocket of the access
protomer with an affinity of −9.6 kcal/mol, whereas the best
poses of CIP and CHL bind to the extrude tunnel of the extrude protomer
with affinities of −8.8 and −7.9 kcal/mol, respectively,
whereas the best poses of PAβN and LEV bind to the distal pocket
of the binding protomer with affinities of −9.3 and −7.7
kcal/mol respectively. This is consistent with the observation of
Takatsuka et al.,56 who showed that, by
molecular docking in AcrB, PAβN predominantly binds to the hydrophobic
groove (distal binding site), whereas CHL binds to the proximal binding
pocket and is pumped out. Their docking study also showed that LEV
seems to bind, at least predominantly, with its hydrophobic group
bound to the upper groove of the binding site and with its hydrophilic
group often exposed in the very wide substrate tunnel, which is in
good agreement with the LEV orientation observed in the distal binding
site of AdeB in the current study, which has been shown in Figure S2. In another study, Lomovskaya et al.26 experimentally showed that although PAβN
inhibits the LEV efflux by MexB in S. aureus and increases the susceptibility to this antibiotic, it was surprisingly
much less effective in inhibiting the efflux of ethidium and carbenicillin.
Also, GEN, which is not a substrate of MexB, was not affected by PAβN.
The results of the current study also suggest that GEN, CHL, and CIP
interact less favorably with the distal binding pocket and the addition
of PAβN does not affect the ability of the pump to extrude these
antibiotics as there is probably no competition between them and PAβN.
Therefore, the presence of PAβN has no effect on the susceptibility
to these antibiotics. In contrast, as LEV prefers to bind to the distal
binding site with a good affinity, it could compete with PAβN
for the distal binding pocket. Therefore, the presence of PAβN
could decrease the amount of efflux of LEV by occupying the distal
binding site. This potentially explains why PAβN could increase
the susceptibility of certain antibiotics like LEV57 and not others like GEN, CIP, and CHL.

2.2 Critical Interactions
GOLD molecular
docking of PAβN to the binding site, located by Smina, also
showed that the affinity of PAβN to the AdeB transporter (ΔG −42.9 kcal/mol and score 35.36) is favorable. Phe-cluster
residues, including Phe136, Phe178, Phe569, Phe612, Phe623, and Phe669,
provided effective π interactions between the ligand and the
transporter. These strong interactions resulted in a higher score
and favorable docking energy.

The interactions between PAβN
and the key residues of the multibinding site of the AdeB transporter
can be seen in Table 1 and Figure 4. PAβN
binds to the space under the Phe loop, toward the Phe-cluster region
that partly overlaps the distal binding site. PAβN is sandwiched
between the Phe612 and Ser134 loops (Figure 4a). Additionally, the side chains containing
residues Gln42 in the PN1 subdomain and the side chain containing
residue Glu665 in the PC2 subdomain surround the guanidinium moiety
of PAβN, and Met570 and Phe612 interact hydrophobically with
the phenyl and naphthyl rings of PAβN, respectively. Ser134,
Glu665, Thr668, and Gln42 form hydrogen bonds with PAβN (Table 1).

a The distance cutoff and neighbor
distance criterion were set to 5 and 4 Å, respectively. Proton
donor–acceptor distance was considered for the H-bonds.

Detection of PAβN into the
narrow channel (under the Phe
loop) in AdeB suggests that the path under the Phe loop is wide enough
for PAβN to pass through the transporter (Figure 4b).

2.3 Interaction Energies of
the Phe Residues of
the Distal Binding Site with PAβN
The analysis of the interaction energies between the residues of
the binding site and PAβN in the complex shows the importance
of the Phe residues in the interaction of PAβN with the transporter
(Table 2). These results
show a good series of interaction energies between PAβN and
the Phe residues. More negative values in Table 2 represent the Phe residues that provided
key interactions with PAβN at that time of the simulation. The
tightest-interaction energy extracted from different snapshots of
MD trajectories belongs to Phe612, during the 50 ns simulation. Table S2 series represent all of the interaction
energies between the ligand and the key residues of the protein over
the course of the MD simulation in which Phe and non-Phe residues
are involved. However, the Phe residues form a hydrophobic microenvironment
surrounding the ligand and make the area of the distal site suitable
for strong hydrophobic interactions with ligands like PAβN and
thereby prevent their efflux.

The high interaction
energies between the Phe residues and PAβN
during the MD simulation trajectories suggest the ordered switching
of PAβN to different Phe residues to pass through the narrow
channel and then the distal binding pocket, going toward the tunnel.
PAβN appeared to behave like a climber as we observed switching
of the interaction energies between the ligand and the key Phe residues
of binding site during the course of the simulation. It used the Phe
residues of the Phe-cluster as hooks to go forward in the channel.
It appeared to climb and move upward in the distal binding pocket
along the intramolecular channel of the transporter. The more favorable
energies (Table 2)
belonged to Phe612, located in the front, and Phe669, located behind
PAβN (Figure 5). This indicates that the ligand had attraction to both sides simultaneously,
which aided the forward movement by creating a hydrophobic trap.

(3D) structure of PAβN in the binding
monomer of A. baumannii AdeB. The average
structure was calculated from the MD trajectories with surface format;
the blue color represents low hydrophobicity (the side of the proximal
binding site), and the brown areas represent the highly hydrophobic
(the side of the distal binding pocket) region. (b) Three-dimensional

interactions by dotted pink lines. (c) Two-dimensional structure of

the complex (the figures were generated using the Accelrys discovery
studio).

To provide further information
and to explore the role of the identified
residues in ligand binding, we have carried out an in silico mutagenesis
study. Blind molecular docking was performed to compare the affinity
of PAβN to that of the mutated targets over the native form.
The PAβn affinity of −9.6 kcal/mol to the native distal
binding pocket of AdeB decreased for single mutant targets of F612G,
F669G, and S134G to −8.4, −8.5, and 7.7 kcal/mol, respectively.
The affinity after double mutation decreased to −8.0 kcal/mol
for F612G–S134G, and surprisingly no pose in the distal binding
pocket was observed for F612G–F669G. This in silico mutagenesis
study further supports the importance of the identified residues in
ligand binding. The distances between PAβN and each of the Phe
residues that are close to the binding site were monitored during
the 50 ns MD simulation of the complex (Figure 6). The distance between PAβN and the
residue at the tip of the Phe loop in AdeB (Phe612) gradually decreased
during the course of the simulation. It can be seen from Figure 6 that the trend of
distances between Phe residues and PAβN during the course of
MD simulation does not vary considerably, implying that the ligand
faces considerable hindrance when passing through the Phe residues
and the binding site, thus making its extrusion difficult.

Figure 6 Distances between
PAβN (atom N2) and residues of Phe-cluster
(atom CG in the benzene ring of each Phe residue) in the multibinding
site of the transporter.

Figure 7 shows
the
orientation of PAβN at the beginning, middle, and at the end
of the MD simulations in the multisite pockets of the AdeB transporter.
The Ser loop of the PN1 domain is on the other side of the narrow
channel, under the Phe loop of PC1. The distance between Phe612 and
Ser134 plays a critical role in modulating the size of channel’s
width, consequentially switching the ligand-accessible conformers
of the binding protomer. This improved access allowed PAβN to
bind to the binding site.

Figure 7 Structural snapshots at 0, 25, and 50 ns of
the MD simulation showing
the different orientations of PAβN within multibinding sites
of the AdeB transporter and conformational changes of the Phe loop
and Ser loop in the multibinding sites.

Figure S3a shows the changes in
the
width of the channel during the 50 ns MD simulation by monitoring
the distance between Phe612 and Ser134. The channel width remains
between 10 and 14 Å, which is wide enough for PAβN to pass
through, as a small-molecular-mass ligand, during the course of the
simulation.

2.4 Hydrogen Bond Analysis
The analysis
of hydrogen bonds formed between the ligand and protein in the 50
ns MD trajectory showed just a few nonpermanent H-bond interactions
(Table 3). Because
the occupancy of these hydrogen bonds is relatively low (Table 3) during the simulation,
the hydrogen-bonding interactions are unlikely to play dominant roles
in the association of PAβN with the transporter. On the other
hand, the hydrophobic interactions involving the Phe residues and
PAβN remained strong during the course of MD simulation and
most likely played a more significant role.

Standard deviations are shown in parentheses.

The fluctuation of the distance between a residue
(Gln292) and
the ligand during the MD simulation can be seen in FigureS2b. Although Gln292 has a potential to form hydrogen
bond with PAβN, the distance between them in the first 30 ns
was often more than 3.5 Å. This indicates that the hydrogen bond
that may form is relatively short-lived and is unlikely to play an
important role in the association between PAβN and the transporter.

2.5 Hydrophobic Microenvironment
The
microenvironment of the binding site, surrounded by the nonpolar Phe
residues and polar residues such as GLu89, Ser134, Ser670, Gln42,
and Gln292, is shown in Figure 5c. Nonpolar residues provide a hydrophobic trap around PAβN
in AdeB. Particularly, Phe residues that are in close contact with
the ligand are important participants of the hydrophobic microenvironment.
The hydrophobic microenvironment can also potentially help in strengthening
the electrostatic interactions58,59 between the ligand
and the binding site residues (Figure 5a,b). This observation is the key to understanding
the inhibition of the AdeB transporter by PAβN as this strong
interaction traps the ligand in the binding pocket and consequently
prevents the conformational switch.

The number and location
of the Phe residues around the ligand were pivotal in creating a hydrophobic
microenvironment, and the residues of the binding site of AdeB mostly
interacted with PAβN through the formation of hydrophobic interactions,
as seen in Figure 5b. Moreover, although some H-bonds can be observed, they do not appear
to play any significant role due to their relatively short life time
during the course of the simulation. The interactions between the
key residues of the binding site of the AdeB transporter and PAβN
after the 50 ns simulation can be seen in Table 4. The phenylalanine and β-naphthylamide
groups of PAβN are involved in π interactions with Phe
residues in the more hydrophobic part of the binding pocket, and the
arginine residue of PAβN is involved in forming H-bonds with
some residues such as Ser134, Gln42, Gln292, and Thr668 of the less
hydrophobic part of the binding site.

2.6 Binding
Free Energy
A total of 20
snapshots were collected from the last 200 ps of the MD simulation
of the complex, and the binding free energy was calculated using the
molecular mechanics, Poisson–Boltzmann surface area/molecular
mechanics, generalized Born surface area (MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA) method.

The ΔGPB value of −24.29
kcal/mol, obtained by MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA calculations, showed that the
PAβN–AdeB complex is favorable (Table 5). In the binding free energy calculation,
because normal mode analysis for calculating the entropy contribution
is a time-consuming exercise even with good supercomputers, the value
of 20 kcal/mol was considered for the contribution of the –TΔS term in ligand binding,
which has been used in the literature for similar ligands.60 This provides a standard binding free energy
(ΔGbind) of −4.54 kcal/mol.
The final estimated binding free energy (ΔGGB) value of −34.06 kcal/mol further confirms that
the complex between the ligand and the transporter is favorable.

calculated through formula ΔG = RT ln Kd using the values
of binding energies resulted from analyzing simulations.

c ΔEELE = electrostatic energy as calculated by the MM force field; ΔEvdw = van der Waals contribution from MM; ΔEINT = internal energy arising from the bond,
angle, and dihedral terms in the MM force field (this term always
amounts to 0 in the single trajectory approach); ΔEGAS(MM) = total gas-phase energy (sum of ELE, vdw, and
INT); ΔEPBSUR/ΔEGBSUR = nonpolar contribution to the solvation free energy
calculated by an empirical model; ΔEPBCAL/ΔEGBCAL = the electrostatic contribution
to the solvation free energy calculated by PB or GB, respectively;

ΔEPBELE/ΔEGBELE = sum of the electrostatic solvation free energy
and MM electrostatic energy; ΔGPB/ΔGGB = final estimated binding

The dissociation constant (Kd) for
PAβN was obtained using the calculated total binding free energy
using formula ΔG = RT ln Kd. Because the total binding free energy is
directly proportional to the Kd value
and inversely proportional to the binding affinity, the calculated
value of 4.9 × 10–6 M for Kd suggests that PAβN binds to the transporter with
a high affinity and acts as an inhibitor for the AdeB transporter.

2.7 Movement of PAβN across the Enter and
Exit Tunnels
The analysis of the PAβN–transporter
complex after the MD simulation using the MOLE 2.13.9.6 toolkit showed
the possible entrance tunnels from the vestibule, from the lower external
depression, and from the central cavity and also one exit port (Figure 8a). The exit port
has access to the central cavity, the space between the three monomers
of the transporter in the middle of the homotrimer structure, and
the entrance ports have access to the periplasm or cytoplasm. The
general entrance and exit points for the AdeB efflux pump transporter
share structural similarity with the tunnels identified in P. aeruginosa AcrB and MexB by Nakashima et al.8,61

Figure 8 (a)
General pattern for the entrance and exit ports in the binding
monomer of the AdeB transporter (PAβN is in yellow color). (b)
Zoomed-in view of the red circled area in (a) that shows the different
entrance and exit tunnels in the AdeB transporter. The key residues
located in the gates of tunnels and borders of the multisite binding
pockets have been labeled. The green lines show the path of the travel
of substrates through the pump.

The key residues that are located in the gates of the tunnel
are
Leu666, Ser462, and Ser670 (Figure 8b). These amino acids play an important role in the
movement of PAβN across the channel. Leu666 is located at the
junction of channels 1 and 2, whereas Ser462 is halfway along channel
1 in the transporter and Ser670 of AdeB is located at the entrance
of channel 2. The channels are between 1.35 and 3.85 Å wide,
and this should allow PAβN to enter into the channels and move
toward the exit port.

AdeB has two spacious multisite drug-binding
pockets that line
the drug translocation channel. PAβN, which is taken up from
the three possible entrances, could be transported by a peristaltic
mechanism62 through both pockets and can
be potentially extruded from the top exit. The average structure obtained
after the 50 ns MD simulation for the complex (Figure S4a) suggest that PAβN can enter into the binding
monomer in the AdeB transporter with relative ease. Therefore, PAβN
might act as a substrate for the AdeB transporter. In addition, according
to the radius profile of the tunnels for entering and exporting of
PAβN detected in the transporter (Figure S4b,c), the tunnels form internal pores that are wide enough
to allow PAβN to pass through. Also Figure S5 depicts the view of the entrance and exit gates of PAβN
in the AdeB transporter from the outside, which suggests that it may
be possible to extrude PAβN from the transporter. However, because
of the strong hydrophobic interaction with the Phe residues located
within the binding pocket, it is likely that PAβN would remain
trapped within the Phe-cluster and could not be extruded by the transporter.

2.8 Fluctuations and Flexibility of Binding Monomer
Residues
According to the literature on the binding monomer,
the Phe loop swings toward the ligand-binding site and, as a result,
prevents ligands from binding to the proximal pocket in the binding
monomer of AcrB and glycine residues in the Phe loop have a critical
role in loop translocation.8 In this study,
the fluctuation of the residues in the ligand-free transporter and
AdeB transporter in complex with PAβN during the course of MD
simulation showed a considerably different root-mean-square fluctuation
for Phe612 of AdeB in complex with PAβN in comparison to that
in the ligand-free form of AdeB (Figure 9), which confirms the swing motion of the
Phe loop. Additionally, an essential dynamics analysis has been performed
(Figure S6), which further validates the
swing motion of the Phe loop.

Figure 9 Atomic positional fluctuations (Å) of Cα
atoms in the
ligand-bound transporter (blue line) compared to those in the ligand-free
protein (red line) in A. baumannii AdeB.
The key residues, Phe612, Phe136, Phe623, Phe669, and Phe672, show
notably less flexibility compared to that of the other residues.

Binding monomer’s residues
in the complex exhibited a slightly
more flexibility just for 50% of residues than that of the ligand-free
form of the transporter in the structural alignment analysis (Figure 9). However, the key
residues involved in the interaction with PAβN (e.g., Phe612,
Phe136, Phe623, Phe669, and Phe672) showed notably less flexibility
compared to that of the other residues of the binding monomer. This
suggests that the presence of PAβN may have provided additional
stability to the binding monomer. This can potentially prevent the
switching of binding monomers to different conformations that are
required to extrude a ligand by the transporter. This additional stability
can be explained by the architecture of the binding site and its building
blocks, particularly Phe building blocks. The presence of the Phe
residues in the distal binding site creates a hydrophobic pocket.
The energy calculation provides evidence that the Phe residues of
the binding monomer in the form of Phe-clusters favorably interact
with PAβN and trap the ligand in the distal pocket. This ultimately
leads to the inhibition of the peristaltic mechanism and prevents
the exporter from extruding any other substrates, leading to the inhibition
of the tripartite pump. This observation is similar to that observed
by Vargiu and Nikaido7 for the PAβN
interaction with the AcrB multibinding site. The movement of PAβN
in the AcrB multibinding site caused it to straddle the G-loop (Phe617
loop) structure, which contributed to its ability to form interactions
with the Phe residues. Recently, Kinana and co-workers27 suggested that PAβN inhibits the efflux
of other drugs by binding to the hydrophobic trap in the distal binding
pocket of AcrB and interfering with the binding of other drug substrates
to the upper part of the binding pocket. Our results for the AdeB
transporter, in good agreement with the recent study, showed that
PAβN does not considerably move inside AdeB and has a consistently
strong interaction with Phe612 and other Phe residues of the distal
binding pocket. The interaction of PAβN with the hydrophobic
trap reduces the flexibility of the transporter, and this partly explains
some of the inhibition mechanisms of PAβN. The study provides
new information about the dual nature, a substrate and an inhibitor,
of PAβN in its interaction with AdeB and partially explains
the contradictory nature of the experimental data available in the
literature.

It is urgent to develop specific inhibitors of efflux
pumps to
suppress the activities of these pumps and restore the sensitivity
of bacteria, such as A. baumannii,
to commonly used antibiotics to reverse antimicrobial resistance.
Understanding the way in which the AdeB transporters identify and
transport agents will help researchers to develop new strategies to
tackle efflux-mediated resistance63 and
may provide inhibitors that will improve the efficacy of current antibiotics
that are used to treat MDR infections in the clinic.61 Development of molecular models of these tripartite pumps
and their interaction with EPIs also pave the way to study a large
number of potential leadlike molecules to develop potential inhibitors
of these pumps.

3 Conclusions
Information
obtained from this study provides detailed insight
into the interaction of PAβN with the AdeB transporter in A. baumannii. The amino acid sequences in the binding
site of the pump dictate the way in which PAβN interacts and
either inhibits the transporter by interacting with the hydrophobic
microenvironment with diverse strengths in the binding site of the
complex or gets effluxed through the tunnel. It appeared from this
study that the location and number of Phe residues, in the binding
site, played a crucial role in stabilizing the PAβN–AdeB
complex and kept the binding monomer in the binding stage. This could
prevent the conformational switch of the binding monomer to access
stage, which is essential to continue the peristaltic mechanism of
the tripartite pump. We hope that the passage of PAβN through
the transporter, the structure of the hydrophobic trap described in
this study, and identification of the key residues of AdeB that interact
with PAβN during the simulation could contribute to the design
of new effective and selective EPIs that may play key roles in reversing
antimicrobial resistance.

4 Computational Methods
We explored the interaction of PAβN with the AdeB efflux
pump transporter of A. baumannii using
different computational methods, including MD simulation, MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA
calculation, and molecular docking. Homology modeling was applied
for the generation of the structural model of the homotrimer transporter
in a PDB format.

4.1 Homology Modeling
The Swiss-Model
webserver64−68 was used for the homology modeling of the AdeB structural model
using the FASTA formatted target sequence with UniProt entry number
of B7I7F7_ACIB5, represented at the end of the Supporting Information. The crystal structure of AcrB from E. coli (PDB ID 1IWG) was selected as a template with a sequence
identity of 50.36% in the amino acid sequence of the target. A comparison
between the critical residues of the developed AdeB model and the
template AcrB model is shown in Table S1.

The trimer of the AdeB protein was obtained as the final
model from homology modeling in a 3D PDB structure format. The template
that we used for the homology modeling was a monomer structure; therefore,
the generated model was also a monomer structure and the assembly
procedure was performed using the Accelrys discovery studio.69 The generated model was without any gap, and
all of the segments were solved. Accelrys discovery studio 4.5 was
used to add probable missing side chains in the generated model. However,
to eliminate the possibilities of steric clashes and suboptimal geometries,
the structure was successfully minimized by the AMBER package program70,71 before carrying out the MD simulations. The minimization was performed
in vacuum through 1500 cycles, wherein 500 cycles of steepest descent
were followed by 1000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. Figure S7 shows the validation of the structural
model for the AdeB model, including the residue-wise profile, using
ProSA analysis (protein structure analysis).72,73 The Z-score of the model was within the range of
scores calculated for proteins of similar size with experimentally
determined structures, indicating good overall quality of the built
model. The local similarity of AdeB monomers to the template target
is shown in Figure S8.

4.2 Molecular Docking
Molecular docking
protocols are methods that predict the preferred orientation of a
bound ligand to a target that forms a stable complex. Knowledge of
the preferred orientation in turn may be used to predict the strength
of association between two molecules. For example, molecular docking
has been performed to generate several distinct binding orientations
and binding affinity for each binding mode. Subsequently, the lowest
binding free energy has been considered as the most favorable binding
mode for the system.

AutoDock Smina,74 which uses the AutoDock Vina scoring function by default, was used
for the blind molecular docking of PAβN to the AdeB structure
for finding the best binding site in the homotrimer by exploring all
probable binding cavities of the proteins. Smina was performed with
default settings, which samples nine ligand conformations using the
Vina docking routine of stochastic sampling. Then, GOLD molecular
docking75,76 was applied for the docking of PAβN
to the Smina-located best binding site of the homotrimer for performing
flexible molecular docking. On the basis of the fitness function scores
and ligand-binding positions, the best-docked poses for the PAβN
were selected. The lower fitness function score of the poses, generated
using the GOLD program that has the highest GOLD fitness energy, reveals
the best-docked pose.

The GOLD molecular docking procedure was
performed by applying
the GOLD protocol76 in Accelrys discovery
studio software. The genetic algorithm (GA) was used in GOLD ligand
docking software to examine thoroughly the ligand conformational flexibility
along with the partial flexibility of the protein.77 The maximum number of runs for the ligand was set to 20,
and in each run, a population size of 100 with 100 000 operations
was employed. The number of islands was 5, and the niche size of 2
was considered. The default cutoff value for hydrogen bonds was set
to 2.5 Å (dH-X), and for the van der Waals distance, it was 4.0
Å. The GA docking was terminated when the top solutions attained
the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values within 1.5 Å.78

4.3 MD Simulation
In this study, three
MD simulation runs have been performed. The systems consisted of free
PAβN, ligand-free protein of the A. baumannii AdeB homotrimer transporter, and a complex of PAβN–transporter
that was obtained by GOLD molecular docking.

After the molecular
docking, three 50 ns independent MD simulations were performed for
the complex, ligand-free protein, and free ligand, which were followed
by MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA calculations. All of the MD simulations were carried
out using the AMBER 12.0 package. Each system was solvated using an
octahedral box of TIP3P water molecules with a size of 174.81 ×
153.69 × 229.20. Periodic boundary conditions and the particle-mesh
Ewald method were employed in the simulations.79 Particle-mesh Ewald method enabled us to calculate the
“infinite” electrostatics without truncating the parameters.
During each simulation, all bonds in which the hydrogen atom was present
were considered fixed and all other bonds were constrained to their
equilibrium values by applying the SHAKE algorithm.80 The force field parameters for the ligand were generated
using the ANTECHAMBER module of the AMBER program.

A cutoff
radius of noncovalent interactions was set to 12 Å
for the protein and complex, whereas for the free ligand simulations,
the cutoff radius was set to 10 Å. Each minimization and equilibration
phase was performed in two stages. In the first stage, ions and all
water molecules were minimized for 500 cycles of steepest descent
followed by 500 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. Afterward,
the whole system was minimized for a total of 2500 cycles without
a restraint, wherein 1000 cycles of steepest descent were followed
by 1500 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. In the second stage,
the systems were equilibrated for 500 ps, whereas the temperature
was raised from 0 to 300 K. Then, equilibration was performed without
a restraint for 100 ps, whereas the temperature was kept at 300 K.
Sampling of reasonable configurations was conducted by running a 50
ns simulation with a 2 fs time step at 300 K and 1 atm pressure. A
constant temperature was maintained by applying the Langevin algorithm,
whereas the pressure was controlled by the isotropic position scaling
protocol used in AMBER.81 Time dependence
of RMSD (Å) for the backbone atoms relative to the starting structure
during 50 ns MD simulations of both ligand-free and ligand-bound AdeB
is shown in Figure S9. RMSD curves show
that both simulations have reached equilibrium after ∼30 ns,
indicated by the relatively stable RMSD values from 30 ns to the end
of the simulations.

4.4 MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA Calculations
Twenty
snapshots were collected from the last 200 ps of simulations of the
protein–ligand complex for post-processing analysis. The gas-phase
interaction energy between the protein and the ligand, ΔEMM, is the sum of electrostatic (ΔEELE), internal (ΔEINT), and van der Waals (ΔEvdw) interaction energies. The solvation free energy, ΔGsol, is the sum of polar (ΔGPB) and nonpolar (ΔGSA) parts. The ΔGPB term was calculated
by solving the finite-difference Poisson–Boltzmann equation
using the internal PBSA program.71 The
SCALE value was set to 5. The Parse radii were employed for all atoms.82 The solvent probe radius was set at 1.4 Å
(with the radii in the prmtop files). MM-PBSA running was performed
with the PBSA module (PROC = 2). The value of the exterior dielectric
constant was set at 80, and the solute dielectric constant was set
at 1.83 The nonpolar contribution was determined
on the basis of the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) using the
LCPO method,84 ΔGSA = 0.04356 × ΔSASA, and CAVITY-OFFSET set
at −1.008. Solute entropic contributions (−TΔS) were assumed to be +20 kcal/mol for the
ligand in the complex.60        In the MM-GBSA calculations,
like the MM-PBSA
calculations, the gas-phase interaction energy (ΔEGAS(MM)) and the nonpolar and polar (ΔEPB/GBsol) parts of the solvation energy were calculated.
The electrostatic solvation energy (ΔGGB) was calculated using GB models.85 A value of 80 was used for the exterior dielectric constant, and
a value of 1 was used for the solute dielectric constant. The binding
free energies were calculated using both the MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA methods.
