A chitosan/alginate
dialdehyde multilayered film
was fabricated using the layer-by-layer assembly method. Besides electrostatic
interaction that promotes alternate adsorption of the oppositely charged
polyelectrolytes, the Schiff base reaction between the amine groups
on chitosan and the aldehyde groups on alginate dialdehyde provides
a covalently cross-linked film, which after reduction by sodium cyanoborohydride
is stable under both acidic and alkaline conditions. Moreover, the
cross-linked film is responsive to changes in pH and addition of multivalent
salts. The structural properties of the multilayered film such as
thickness, refractive index, and water content were examined using
simultaneous quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
and spectroscopic ellipsometry.

1 Introduction
Layer-by-layer
(LbL) assembly is a facile and versatile method
to fabricate polymer-coated surfaces with tailored properties.1−4 In most systems, the buildup of the multilayered film is based on
alternate adsorption of oppositely charged polymers through electrostatic
attraction.5−7 The present study focuses on polysaccharide-based
multilayered films containing chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG). ALG
is chiefly extracted from brown seaweeds and is composed of guluronic
(G) and mannuronic (M) acid units forming regions of M-blocks, G-blocks,
and blocks of alternating sequence (MG) (Scheme 1).8,9 CHI, as one of the few
available cationic polysaccharides, consists of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine (Scheme 1) and is obtained through partial deacetylation of
chitin.10−12 Owing to their intrinsic biocompatibility and tunable
chemical structures, CHI/ALG multilayered films have been extensively
investigated as a promising coating material for different biomedical
applications ranging from tissue engineering to targeted drug delivery.13−16 In addition, it has been demonstrated that parameters such as pH,
ionic strength, polymer molecular weight, and polymer concentration
can significantly affect the buildup process.17−25 Careful adjustment of these parameters then allows one to tune the
functional properties of the coating such as permeability and bioadhesion.26−29 The buildup process and properties of CHI/ALG multilayered films
have been widely investigated using different methods, such as quartz
crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), IR spectroscopy,
atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy, confocal
laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and molecular
dynamics simulation.23−25,30−34

Scheme 1 Mechanism for the Formation of Schiff Base Bonds between Chitosan
(CHI) and Alginate Dialdehyde (ADA) and for Reductive Amination of
the Cross-Links
Although electrostatic
attraction is the main driving force for
the buildup of polysaccharide multilayered films, it also limits their
stability. For instance, changes in pH can disrupt the charge neutrality
condition within the film, which can give rise to uncontrolled swelling
and instantaneous disintegration of the film.17,35 To overcome this problem, the assembled film is then chemically
cross-linked using cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde, genipin,
carbodiimide, and diazonium diphenylamine.18,36−38 Use of such cross-linkers, however, has several shortcomings.
For instance, it has been suggested that cross-linking mostly occurs
in the outer layer of the film because of diffusion barriers.39,40 In some cases, it has also been found that the physiochemical properties
of the film such as wettability were notably changed.41,42 On the other hand, incorporation of linker molecules, such as glutaraldehyde,
not only modifies the film structure and physical properties but also
negatively affects its biocompatibility and thus limits the range
of applications.43−45

It has been demonstrated that partial oxidation
of alginate (as
well as other polysaccharides) using periodate causes a ring-opening
reaction that produces two aldehyde groups.46,47 The introduced aldehyde groups on alginate dialdehyde (ADA) can
then interact with the amine groups on CHI to form covalent imine
bonds (R–CH=N–R) through a Schiff base reaction.48,49 Based on this approach, one can then obtain direct cross-linking
between the CHI and ADA chains without using toxic cross-linking agents.50 Aston and co-workers have investigated the interaction
between CHI and ADA using several spectroscopy methods and suggested
improved stability because of the formation of the covalent bonds
within the film.35 In another relevant
work, Jia and co-workers have fabricated hollow microcapsules based
on CHI/ADA.51 As reported in their work,
CHI/ALG microcapsules were promptly dissolved in 0.1 M HCl and 0.1
M NaOH solutions, whereas CHI/ADA microcapsules were stable under
both acidic and alkaline conditions for at least 24 h. Wang and co-workers
have used ADA as a natural cross-linker to obtain chitosan/calcium
polyphosphate composite scaffolds for meniscus tissue engineering
and suggested the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked
network.52 Zhao and co-workers have prepared
composite nanofibers of carboxymethyl chitosan cross-linked with ADA.
They have also inferred enhanced stability in both acidic (1 M HAc)
and alkaline (1 M NaOH) solutions for at least 3 days.53 Liang and co-workers have fabricated a hydrogel
based on hydroxypropyl chitosan and ADA, which was examined with respect
to cytotoxicity, histocompatibility, and degradability in vivo for
tissue engineering.54 Mu and co-workers
have fabricated CHI/ADA microcapsules, which were reportedly stable
under acidic and neutral conditions but could disintegrate in strongly
alkaline media (pH 12).55 Accordingly,
the intrinsic stability toward pH changes and natural biocompatibility
of CHI/ADA multilayered films make them a potential coating material
with applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.

In
this work, we fabricated a self-cross-linked CHI/ADA multilayered
film that is both pH- and salt-responsive. Although the multilayer
buildup is still driven by electrostatic attraction, the formation
of additional imine bonds can provide enhanced stability. However,
the Schiff base is reportedly a dynamic covalent bond meaning that
it can dissociate specifically under acidic conditions.56,57 For this reason, we have post-modified the assembled film by a reductive
amination reaction using sodium cyanoborohydride to transform the
reversible imine bonds (R–CH=N–R) into permanent
amine bonds (R–CH2–NH–R).58 After stabilizing the cross-linked structure,
the stimuli-responsive behavior of the multilayered film with respect
to changes in pH and addition of multivalent salts was investigated.
In situ QCM-D and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were carried
out to thoroughly examine the structural properties of the multilayer
such as thickness, conformation, water content, and refractive index.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Sodium
alginate (NaALG,
viscosity ≥2000 cP for 2% solution in water at 25 °C),
chitosan (CHI, a degree of deacetylation of 75–85%, viscosity
20–300 cP for 1% solution in acetic acid at 25 °C), 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane
(GPS, ≥98%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥97%), hydrochloric
acid (HCl, 37%), dibasic sodium phosphate (Na2HPO3, ≥99%), sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO3, ≥99%), sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN,
95%), sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4, ≥99.5%), hydroxylamine
hydrochloride (HONH2·HCl, 99.99%), sodium chloride
(NaCl, ≥99%), sodium bicarbonate (≥99.7%), calcium chloride
(CaCl2, ≥99%), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, ≥99%), methyl orange reagent (85%), and ethylene
glycol (99.8%) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Degassed ultrapure
water (Milli-Q Plus 185 system with a 0.2 μm Millipak filter)
with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm and organic content below 5
ppb was used to prepare all of the buffers and polymer solutions.

Alginate dialdehyde (ADA) was prepared using sodium periodate (NaIO4), as previously reported.59−61 A detailed description
of the oxidation procedure and characterization data is provided in Section S1, Supporting Information. ADA stock
solution (1% w/v) was prepared in Milli-Q water with no pH adjustment.
CHI was purified by filtration and freeze-drying, as reported previously.25,30 The obtained powder was then dissolved in 1% (v/v) HCl solution
to obtain a 1% (w/v) stock solution. Next, 100 ppm CHI and 200 ppm
ADA solutions in 15 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer were
prepared by diluting the stock solutions and the pH of both solutions
was adjusted to 6. For post-reduction of the fabricated film, solutions
containing 30 mM NaBH3CN in 15 mM PBS at pH 6 and 9 were
also prepared. To investigate the effect of pH, a solution containing
14.1 mM NaCl and 1 mM NaHCO3 (total ionic strength of 15.1
mM) was used as the reference buffer. Hereafter, the pH of this solution
was adjusted to 2, 6, and 9 using HCl or NaOH. For the multivalent
salt solutions, 4.7 mM Na2SO4 and 4.7 mM CaCl2 were each mixed with 1 mM NaHCO3 (total ionic
strength of 15.1 mM) and the pH was adjusted to 2, 6, and 9, respectively.

2.2 Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation
Monitoring (QCM-D)
QCM-D (Q-Sense E1, Biolin Scientific,
Gothenburg, Sweden) measurements were performed to monitor the LbL
buildup and stimuli-responsive behavior of the multilayer. In such
an experiment, the frequency (f) of the oscillating
crystal inversely correlates with the total mass coupled with the
sensor. In addition, QCM-D monitors the oscillation decay after the
driving voltage is repeatedly switched on and off, providing the dissipation
(damping) factor as a semiquantitative measure of the film “softness”.
The measured shifts in the oscillation frequency and dissipation for
different overtones can be related to the thickness and viscoelastic
properties of the polymer film using different modeling approaches.
For thin, uniform, and rigid films, the frequency shifts show a linear
dependence on the adsorbed mass per unit area according to the Sauerbrey
equation62 1  where msau is
the sensed mass according to the Sauerbrey estimation, C is the mass sensitivity constant of the sensor (0.181 mg m–2 Hz–1 for the crystals with a resonance frequency
of 4.95 MHz), and n is the overtone number. The Sauerbrey
equation considers the adsorbed film as a rigid film that perfectly
follows the sensor oscillation with no viscous deformation. Hence,
the above equation can provide a valid estimation only if the ratio
of dissipation and normalized frequency shifts ((ΔDn)/(−Δfn/n)) is smaller than 4 × 10–7 Hz–1; otherwise, the adsorbed mass will be underestimated.62 In contrast, soft and highly hydrated polymeric
films generally cannot be quantified by the Sauerbrey estimation,
meaning that the linear relationship between the frequency shift and
the adsorbed mass no longer holds. Instead, the so-called effective
coupled mass depends on how the oscillatory acoustic wave propagates
through the attached film. As a result, additional effects from the
coupled water (either bound or unbound) and the viscous drag force
will contribute to the frequency shifts.62,63 Under this condition, the viscoelastic Voigt modeling can provide
a better estimation, where the adhered film is represented by a layer
of uniform thickness and density with distinct viscous and elastic
components.64,65 Accordingly, the frequency and
dissipation shifts are related to the properties of the film and medium
by 2   3  where ω
is the angular frequency of
oscillation, η0 and ρ0 are the viscosity
and density of the medium, and dq and
ρq are the thickness and density of the quartz crystal
resonator.64,65 To avoid overparameterization,
the medium density, medium viscosity, and film density are estimated
and then treated as fixed parameters in the model. Therefore, the
thickness (df), viscosity (ηf), and shear modulus (μf) of the polymeric
film are obtained by fitting the Voigt model to the measured shifts
in frequency and dissipation for different overtones. The instrument
software (Dfind, Biolin Scientific) was herein employed for modeling
the data. The density of the film (ρf) was estimated
to be 1100 kg m–3 (estimation of ρf is provided in Section S2, Supporting
Information).64,66,67 The density and viscosity of water at 25 °C (provided in the
software library) were used for the medium.

2.3 Spectroscopic
Ellipsometry
Spectroscopic
ellipsometry (M-2000X, J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.) measurements were performed
simultaneously with QCM-D, using the Q-Sense Ellipsometry Module (Biolin
Scientific). In a typical spectroscopic ellipsometry configuration
(Scheme 2), spectroscopic
light from a light source passes through a polarizer unit that sets
the incident polarization state.68,69 The interaction
of light with the sample leads to a change in the polarization state
of the light, which is described in terms of ellipsometric ψ
and Δ. These parameters are related to the thickness and optical
properties of the sample according to 4  The subscripts
p and s refer to parallel and
perpendicular directions with respect to the plane of incidence, and rp and rs represent
the reflection coefficients. ψ represents the angle determined
from the amplitude ratio between p- and s-polarizations, whereas Δ
refers to the phase difference between the two components. The complex
reflectance ratio (ρ) is a function of the optical structure
of the sample and includes information about its physical properties.
The polarization state of the reflected light accordingly depends
on the angle of incidence (θ0), the thicknesses (hj) of the layers, the complex refractive indices
(Nj = nj +
ikj) of the layers, the ambient (Na), and the substrate (Ns). Knowing the nominal structure of the sample and using appropriate
optical models, one can predict ψ and Δ from the Fresnel’s
equation, whereafter the best match between the modeled and experimentally
determined angles will be found through regression.

Scheme 2 Schematic Illustration
of (A) in Situ QCM-D and Spectroscopic Ellipsometry
Setup and (B) Optical Models Used To Characterize the Optical Thickness,
Refractive Index, and Water Content of the Film
Herein, the ellipsometric ψ and Δ
were obtained over
a wavelength range between 250 and 1000 nm and at a 70° angle
of incidence. The instrument software (CompleteEASE, J.A. Woollam)
was employed to fit the optical models to the ellipsometric data.
The optical model used herein is composed of three layers (Scheme 2) representing a
uniform hydrated polymer film, a silica coating, and a thick optically
opaque titanium substrate.70,71 The bare sensor surface
was modeled as a “pseudosubstrate” from the ellipsometric
data obtained for the bare sensor in the buffer; then, the fitted
parameters were fixed in the model (detailed description of modeling
is available in Section S3, Supporting
Information). For the medium, the optical data of pure water at 25
°C from the software library was used. Considering that the ionic
strength of all of the used buffer solutions was around 15 mM, the
changes in the refractive index from water can be considered to be
minor.72 The CHI/ADA multilayered film
was considered to be a transparent and homogeneous single layer with
no adsorption; then, its refractive index was described by the Cauchy
dispersion67 5  In this equation, Cf was fixed to 0 to avoid correlation between the fitting
parameters.
The hydrated multilayered film was first considered as a single-component
Cauchy layer, where its thickness and effective dispersion coefficients
(Aeff, Beff) were estimated from fitting. Alternatively, the hydrated film was
modeled as a two-component layer composed of a dry polymer and water;
then, the layer thickness and volume fraction of water were estimated
from fitting. The dry polymeric component was considered to be homogeneous
in optical behavior, and estimated values of Apolymer = 1.51 and Bpolymer = 0.005
were used for the mixture of CHI and ADA.73−75 The volume
fraction of water (φw) was related to the refractive
indices of the hydrated layer (nmix),
dry polymer (npolymer), and water (nwater) using the Bruggeman effective medium
approximation (BEMA) given as 6  Several
modeling options such as surface roughness,
thickness nonuniformity, anisotropicity, and grading were checked;
however, none of which significantly improved the fitting quality
and were found to impose cross-correlation between the fitting parameters.
The quality of the fitting was evaluated according to the mean-squared
error value (MSE < 10), the uniqueness of the fitted parameters,
and a weak correlation between the fitting parameters (the optimization
of the optical models is discussed in Section S4, Supporting Information).

2.4 Layer-by-Layer
(LbL) Assembly
Silica-sputtered
quartz sensors (QSX 335, Biolin Scientific) recommended for in situ
QCM-D and ellipsometry measurements were employed herein. First, the
sensor was repeatedly washed with acetone and absolute ethanol, then
rinsed with copious amounts of Milli-Q water, and finally dried by
compressed air. To remove possible organic contaminants, the sensor
was hereafter plasma-treated (PDC-32G plasma cleaner, Harrick Plasma)
using medium power under a constant water pressure of 500 mTorr for
5 min. To graft CHI to the silica surface, the silica surface was
coated with GPS.76 To do so, the sensor
was immersed in 18 % v/v GPS/acetone solution for 22 h, followed by
rinsing with acetone several times, and dried for 40 min at 100 °C.
The first chitosan layer was then grafted to the sensor using the
amino-oxirane addition reaction,77,78 by dipping
the GPS-coated sensor in a 1% (w/v) chitosan solution with pH 6 for
40 min, followed by rinsing with water. The sensor with a grafted
CHI layer was then mounted in the in situ QCM-D/ellipsometry module,
and the measurement was started under a 150 μL min–1 flow rate of 15 mM PBS buffer with pH 6 at 25 °C. After obtaining
a stable baseline for all of the harmonics (3rd–13th overtones),
the following LbL deposition procedure was conducted. The ADA solution
was pumped into the chamber for 40 min, followed by 20 min rinsing
with PBS buffer. Using the same procedure, CHI and ADA layers were
sequentially deposited onto the sensor to obtain an overall layer
number of 15 (including the pregrafted CHI layer). Deposition of the
layers was performed at pH 6, which is relatively close to the expected
pKa value for CHI (pKa is about 6.3–6.5).10,11 This pH value
was chosen as a compromise between on one hand having enough −NH3+ groups to ensure solubility of CHI and on the
other hand having enough −NH2 groups to form Schiff
base cross-links between CHI and ADA.79 The fabricated multilayered film was then post-treated using NaBH3CN solution to transform the dynamic imine bond into a permanent
amine bond.49,58 To do so, the NaBH3CN solution with pH 6 was first pumped into the chamber for 30 min,
followed by rinsing and then a 1 h treatment by NaBH3CN
solution at pH 9. After cross-linking, the chamber was reloaded with
15 mM PBS solution at pH 6.

The effect of pH and multivalent
ions on the multilayer properties was later investigated. The baseline
was obtained in the reference buffer (14.1 mM NaCl and 1 mM NaHCO3 at pH 6). Hereafter, the pH was repeatedly changed (three
times) between 6 and 2 and then between 6 and 9. An equilibration
time of 40 min was given in between each pH change. To investigate
the effect of multivalent ions, the solutions of NaCl, Na2SO4, and CaCl2 of different pH values were
loaded. Throughout the experiment, the ellipsometric ψ and Δ
values were measured at the end of each rinsing step.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 LBL Assembly
Figure 1A illustrates the
QCM-D data in terms of
the measured shifts in the oscillation frequency and the dissipation
factor during the multilayer growth. The oscillation frequency (f) is inversely related to the effective mass coupled with
the sensor, which in the present case includes the adsorbed polymer
chains and the water content associated with the multilayer. The dissipation
factor (D) provides semiquantitative information
about the structural properties of the polymeric film, i.e., a soft
and swollen film is characterized by a large dissipation factor, whereas
a rigid and compact film is quantified by a relatively small damping
factor.

and dissipation changes (black: f3 and D3; red f5 and D5; blue: f7 and D7; olive: f9 and D9; magenta: f11 and D11; violet: f13 and D13) as a function of time. (B) Dissipation vs
frequency shifts for the third overtone upon each layer deposition.
(C) Film Thickness from the Sauerbrey (black square) and Voigt (red
circle) models as a function of deposition number.

In Figure 1A, a
monotonic decrement in the oscillation frequency is observed upon
each deposition step, indicating adsorption of the polymers to the
sensor and effective LbL assembly. On the other hand, the dissipation
factor demonstrates an overall increment but with a nonmonotonic trend,
which can suggest conformational restructuring during the LbL assembly.
The growth mechanism and structural evolutions can be better examined
according to Figure 1B, where the dissipation shifts are plotted against the frequency
shifts for each deposited layer. Deposition of the first bilayer (ADA
+ CHI) is accompanied with a relatively large dissipation shift of
around 2.8 and a frequency shift of around −30 Hz, which together
indicate a rather swollen and hydrated structure in the beginning.
Beyond the first bilayer (where the surface decoupling effect is likely),
a zigzag trend is however demonstrated. Accordingly, deposition of
CHI, in general, is accompanied by a frequency shift of around −20
Hz and a dissipation shift of around 2. In contrast, deposition of
ADA is characterized by a relatively smaller frequency shift of around
−10 Hz and a decrement of around 2 in dissipation. These opposite
effects can be reasoned on the basis of the charge density and conformation
of the adsorbed layers, which promote restructuring of the film during
growth.17,22 CHI reportedly demonstrates a pKa in the range of 6.3–6.5 (pKa of amine is 6.3),10,11 meaning that CHI chains
possess a relatively low charge density and swollen coil conformation
at pH 6, at which the multilayered film is fabricated. ADA with a
pKa of 3.4–3.7 is however highly
charged and stretched under this pH condition.35 As a result, when CHI is adsorbed as the topmost layer,
one can expect a dangling and swollen interfacial layer high in loops
and tails, which is in agreement with the large increment in dissipation
upon CHI deposition. Such a swollen top layer is also accompanied
by a relatively large water content, which can be another reason for
the marked gain in dissipation. These two inter-related effects could
be responsible for the rather larger frequency shift. On the one hand,
the relatively large hydrodynamic water content can strongly contribute
to the effective sensed mass, causing viscous drag forces. On the
other hand, CHI is less charged compared with ADA at the deposition
conditions, partly due to the lower density of dissociable groups
(which is determined by the degree of deacetylation) and partly due
to the proximity to the pKa value of CHI.
Thus, a relatively larger amount of CHI monomers should be adsorbed
to compensate the ADA charge.17,79

On the contrary,
deposition of the highly charged and elongated
ADA chains can suppress the dangling CHI loops and tails, which can
give rise to a more compact and less hydrated CHI layer beneath. It
should also be considered that the adsorbed ADA can form covalent
cross-links with the CHI layer beneath, which can make the interfacial
top layer more rigid. Therefore, two cross-effects are plausible upon
deposition of ADA. On the one hand, a certain amount of new polymer
(effective mass) is added to the multilayer and then the sensor, which
corresponds to an expected positive dissipation shift and a negative
frequency shift. On the other hand, the swollen CHI layer beneath
consequently transforms into a relatively compact and dehydrated sublayer,
which is characterized by a decrement in dissipation (collapse) and
increment in frequency (water loss). The counterbalance of these two
effects could justify the negative dissipation shift and relatively
small frequency change upon ADA deposition. A closer examination of
the results also reveals that after the first two bilayers the dissipation
value of the film roughly fluctuates between 3.5 (when ADA is the
outer layer) and 5.5 (when CHI is the outer layer). This observation
confirms that the structure and water content of the multilayer are
mostly governed by the topmost layer, whereas the sublayers are found
in a compact state and probably lose water following the multilayer
growth.

The Sauerbrey and viscoelastic Voigt models were fitted
to the
QCM-D data to estimate the thickness of the film (Figure 1C). Regardless of the model
used, it can be inferred that the LbL assembly follows a linear growth
mechanism, which is in accordance with the previously reported CHI/ALG
systems.17,18,21−25,30−32,39,41 The thickness of the
deposited film is estimated to be around 46 and 43 nm from the Voigt
and Saurebrey models, respectively. Even though the Sauerbrey model
slightly underestimates the film thickness, the two models are found
to be in fair agreement, which is a further indication of rather low
water content and compacted structure of the polymeric film. As another
important observation, the increment in thickness per CHI layer is
found to be considerably larger than that per ADA layer, which can
suggest that CHI adsorbs in a more swollen and hydrated state. To
further examine the structural characteristics of the multilayer,
spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were simultaneously conducted.

Figure 2 illustrates
the spectroscopic ellipsometric data in terms of the amplitude ratio
(ψ) and phase shift (Δ) after each deposition step. With
respect to the bare sensor (the black solid curve), an oscillation
peak in the UV range is demonstrated in both ψ and Δ spectra,
which can be attributed to the optical interference from the transparent
silica coating on the sensor. The LbL deposition of the polymeric
film on the sensor is accompanied by marked changes in both ψ
and Δ spectra. With respect to ψ (panel A), a monotonic
increment in the amplitude (upward shift) is demonstrated at all of
the wavelengths, whereas a gradual red shift in the spectra is found
upon deposition of each layer. The red shift effect can be more vividly
inferred from the tail of a second peak gradually evolving at low
wave numbers. Both the observations suggest monotonic growth of a
thin transparent film on the sensor that can produce optical interference,
spectral oscillation, and then a gain in ψ. A similar conclusion
can be obtained from Δ spectra (panel B), where a red shift
in the spectra is shown while a clear spectral oscillation evolves
upon polymer deposition. Although some general information can be
deduced from the raw data, it is somewhat challenging to obtain detailed
physical information on the deposited layer from the raw data. Thus,
the ellipsometry data were modeled to assess the film properties more
quantitatively (Table 1).

a The refractive indices at λ
= 632.3 nm are shown.

Both
Cauchy and BEMA models suggest a thickness of around 16 nm
for the multilayered film, which is found to be relatively smaller
than the thickness estimated from QCM-D modeling (around 45 nm). This
difference between the optical and acoustic thicknesses might be attributed
to the sporadic presence of self-assembled structures (with a height
of around 10–100 nm), which can be detected from the AFM images
of the sample (Section S5, Supporting Information).
Such structures can produce additional contributions from viscous
drag force and coupling of hydrodynamic hydration to the frequency
and dissipation shifts, which could provide an overestimated film
thickness.64,77,79−82 On the other hand, the optical thickness is determined on the basis
of the nominal difference (contrast) between the refractive indices
of water and the hydrated film. Accordingly, whereas QCM-D is more
sensitive to the topmost polymer chains and aggregated structures,
ellipsometry in principle sees the dense optically different regions
of the film.83−85 It should also be noted that for thin polymeric films
one can always expect a certain uncertainty when fitting for thickness
and optical constants simultaneously.86,87 In the BEMA
model, the multilayered film is considered as a uniform mixture of
dry polymer and water, which then can provide an estimation of the
water content (volume fraction) in the film. The water content for
the whole film was estimated to be around 3.5 (v/v%), suggesting a
dense and low hydrated structure in agreement with the QCM-D data.
The low water content obtained herein is probably due to the correlation
between the thickness and optical constants of the film, which has
been previously observed for optical modeling of thin polymeric films
(see Section S4, Supporting information).

3.2 Stabilization of the Cross-Links
As discussed
above, the aldehyde groups on ADA form covalent imine
bonds (−CH=N−) with the primary amine groups
on CHI through the Schiff base reaction. The Schiff base bonding is
reportedly a dynamic covalent reaction, meaning that the reaction
is reversible and all of the constituents are in equilibrium.88−90 Accordingly, it has been affirmed that the reactivity of Schiff
base is notably affected by the pH of the solution, i.e., higher acidity
(typically below pH 3) destroys Schiff base, whereas increasing pH
shifts the equilibrium toward Schiff base formation.49,88,91,92 To eliminate pH sensitivity of the covalent bonds and obtain a permanently
cross-linked CHI/ADA film, the Schiff base double bond (R–CH=N–R)
was herein reduced to a stable single bond (R–CH2–NH–R) using sodium cyanoborohydride as a gentle reducing
agent. Cyanoborohydride is known to have a good chemical selectivity,93,94 meaning that the unreacted aldehyde group will not be catalyzed
to alcohol under neutral and basic conditions.58,95 The reduction reaction was conducted in two steps to ensure further
stabilization of the structure. First, the reaction was conducted
at pH 6 to stabilize the Schiff base bonds formed already during LbL
assembly. Afterward, the reduction was performed at pH 9 to favor
the formation of more Schiff base bonds that can be converted into
permanent cross-links (see Section S6,
Supporting Information, for comparison between the stability of multilayered
films with and without the postmodification reaction).

Figure 3A presents the shifts
in QCM-D frequency and dissipation resulting from cross-linking the
film. The two-step cross-linking procedure accordingly produces a
minor frequency shift but a relatively large dissipation shift of
around −2.5 for the third overtone. The rather large decrement
in the dissipation suggests that the multilayer becomes more rigid,
which can originate from either water loss or formation of fixed cross-link
bonds within the film that can effectively hinder the conformational
mobility of the polymer chains. The oscillation frequency, however,
remains almost unchanged, which could indicate two counterbalancing
effects taking place within the layer.

Figure 3 Two-step reduction of
the Schiff base bonds in the multilayered
film conducted at pH 6 and 9. (A) QCM-D frequency and dissipation
changes (black: f3 and D3; red f5 and D5; blue: f7 and D7; olive: f9 and D9; magenta: f11 and D11; and violet: f13 and D13) and (B) ellipsometric ψ
and Δ spectra before and after the process.

Figure 3B
exhibits
the evolution of ψ and Δ spectra upon cross-linking the
film. It is demonstrated that the spectral oscillation in ψ
attenuates, whereas the position of the oscillation peak seems almost
unchanged. The former observation can imply an increment in the water
content of the multilayer, which can then dampen the spectral oscillation
because of polymer dilution and then result in less optical contrast
with the aqueous medium. The latter observation, however, can be reasoned
on the basis of the opposing effects of changes in the thickness and
the refractive index on the spectral oscillation position. Accordingly,
an increment (decrement) in either the thickness or the refractive
index of the film leads to a red shift (blue shift) in the ψ
spectra. Since we have already argued that the water content in the
layer has increased (drop in the refractive index and then a blue
shift effect), the unchanged position of the spectral oscillation
can be attributed to a simultaneous increment in the thickness. Such
an increment in thickness could also be inferred from the slight amplification
of the spectral oscillation in Δ. To further validate these
interpretations, the Cauchy and BEMA models were fitted to the raw
data. Both models affirm that cross-linking of the multilayered film
is accompanied with an increment in thickness from 16 to 19 nm. In
addition, a drop in the refractive index at all wavelengths is presented
and the water content is found to increase roughly from 3.5 to 27.
Knowing that the layer swells upon cross-linking, one can then speculate
that the decrement in the QCM-D dissipation is due to the formation
of a 3D permanent cross-linked network in the film. On the other hand,
the unchanged frequency data might be due to opposite effects, i.e.,
the layer swells (larger effective mass) while simultaneously becomes
rigid (smaller hydrodynamic contribution). The swelling of the multilayer
induced by cross-linking could originate from a charge imbalance condition,
resulting from consumption of some amine groups because of the Schiff
base formation at pH 9. It can also be a result of conformational
hysteresis induced by changing the pH to 9 and back to 6.

3.3 Stimuli-Responsive Behavior: pH Effect
The effect of
changing pH on the thickness and structural characteristics
of the cross-linked multilayered film was monitored by QCM-D (Figure 4A) and spectroscopic
ellipsometry (Figure 4B). As a general observation, the consecutive pH cycles confirm effective
cross-linking that prevents the disintegration of the multilayer.
It is worth mentioning that a structural hysteresis is found specifically
after the first pH cycle (6 → 2 → 6), which could originate
from conformational restructuring within the multilayer that can also
cause irreversible ionization of amine and carboxyl groups.79

Figure 4 Effect of pH on the structural properties of the cross-linked
CHI/ADA
film: (A) QCM-D frequency (black squares) and dissipation change (red
circles) and (B) optical thickness (red circles) and water content
(black squares) obtained from the BEMA model.

Regarding the pH-responsive behavior, changing the condition
to
acidic pH (6 → 2) is accompanied by a decline in the frequency
and a significant gain in the dissipation, which both refer to swelling/rehydration
of the multilayer. This can be seen more clearly from the ellipsometry
modeling data that show a pronounced growth in thickness from 18 to
34 nm, a drop in the refractive index, and an increment in the water
content to 59%. The protonation of amine groups at low pH values alters
the charge balance in the film (net charge of the film becomes more
positive), which gives rise to an osmotic swelling of the film. The
swelling capacity of the film is governed by the balance between the
osmotic pressure of solution and retractive force that originates
from the entropic penalty of elastic stretching of the polymer chains
between the cross-linking points.96,97 Changing the
pH to alkaline condition was similarly followed by a conformational
swelling, however, in a more pronounced manner. Accordingly, a dissipation
shift of around 14 and a decrement in the frequency of around 170
Hz were detected. Furthermore, the optical thickness increased to
around 45 nm and the multilayer water content reached up to 71%. The
swelling of the film herein can be attributed to the deprotonation
of carboxylic acid groups on ADA that can induce a negative charge
in the polymeric film. Finally, it should be noted that while the
driving force for swelling at both pH values 2 and 9 is the osmotic
pressure effect, the swelling is limited by the layer conformation,
position of cross-links, and length of chain segments between cross-links.
Thus, even for a complete charge reversal between acidic and alkaline
conditions, the degree of swelling might be different because of the
different location and distribution of charged groups.

3.4 Stimuli-Responsive Behavior: Effect of Multivalent
Ions
Salts can have specific interactions with polyelectrolytes
in terms of ion-specific binding of the counterions to the charged
moieties on the polymer backbone, which can induce physical cross-links.10,98−100 We have herein compared the effects of calcium
chloride (CaCl2) and sodium sulfate (NaSO4)
at three different pH values, which are depicted in Figure 5. At pH 6, where the layer
is in the proximity of charge neutrality condition, no significant
changes in the QCM-D frequency and dissipation or in the ellipsometric
thickness and refractive index were detected when switching the salt
either from NaCl to Na2SO4 or from NaCl to CaCl2. Although the layer at pH 6 has both negative and positive
charges at which Ca2+ and SO42– ions could potentially bind to, the layer contains no counterions
at this pH value that could be replaced. As a result, binding of Ca2+ and SO42– ions would be entropically
costly and unfavorable.

Figure 5 Effect of salts on the structural properties
of the cross-linked
CHI/ADA film: (A) QCM-D frequency and dissipation change for five
overtones (black: f3 and D3; red f5 and D5; blue: f7 and D7; olive: f9 and D9; and magenta: f11 and D11). (B) Changes in optical thickness (red circles)
and water content (black squares) obtained from the BEMA model as
a function of time. The yellow and blue highlighted areas represent
the Na2SO4 and CaCl2 response processes,
respectively.

At pH 2, the addition
of NaSO4 is accompanied by a notable
drop in dissipation and increment in the frequency, both indicating
a conformational collapse. In the same line, the ellipsometric thickness
is decreased from 54 to 35 nm and the water content dropped from 81
to 72%. At such acidic conditions, the CHI chains are positively charged,
whereas the ADA chains are mostly uncharged. This overall net positive
charge within the film is balanced by Cl– counterions.
Accordingly, the observed layer collapse can be explained on the basis
of entropic substitution of Cl– with SO42– as counterions, which will lead to a drop in
the osmotic pressure and thus layer shrinkage. In addition, physical
cross-linking, in terms of ion bridges, can also lead to a more rigid
network that can also produce a decrement in dissipation. Along the
same line, one can argue why the addition of CaCl2 at pH
2 exhibits no significant impact on any of the measured parameters
since the layer contains no cationic counterions that can be replaced
by Ca2+. On the contrary, at pH 9, where the layer was
inferred to be negatively charged and contain Na+ as counterions,
the addition of CaCl2 has resulted in the conformational
collapse and dehydration because of binding of Ca2+ ions
to the deprotonated carboxyl groups on ADA. For a similar reason,
Na2SO4 is shown to have a limited influence
on the layer structure. Accordingly, the multilayered film is, in
general, demonstrated to be responsive to the addition of divalent
counterions. A qualitatively similar behavior is expected if divalent
ions other than Ca2+ and SO42– were used; however, one can expect some specific ion effects with
respect to the formation of ion bridges and the exact magnitude of
the film collapse might thus show ion specificity.

4 Summary and Conclusions
We have shown that the Schiff base
reaction between amine and aldehyde
groups can be served as an alternative approach to fabricate cross-linked
CHI/ALG films instead of using common cross-linking agents such as
glutaraldehyde. In addition, poststabilization of the cross-links
in the film using sodium cyanoborohydride allows one to obtain stable
covalent cross-links that eliminate pH sensitivity of Schiff base
bonds and then enhance the stability of the film under both acidic
and alkaline conditions. Finally, the cross-linked multilayered film
is found to be responsive to changes in pH and addition of salts,
showing notable variations in structural properties such as thickness
and water content.
