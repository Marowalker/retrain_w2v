In
this work, NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite with a hierarchical structure is prepared by
a multistep process. First, NiCo2O4 nanowires
array on Ni foam is prepared by a hydrothermal and a subsequent calcination
process. Then, the NiCo2O4 nanowires array is
converted to NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite through a vapor-phase hydrothermal process. The NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4/Ni foam electrode
exhibits a specific capacitance of 1872 F g–1 at
1 A g–1, a capacitance retention of 70.5% at 10
A g–1, and a retention ratio of 65% after 4000 charge–discharge
cycles. The capacitance of NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite is much higher than that of the
NiCo2O4 nanowires array. The excellent electrochemical
capacitive performances of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite can be attributed to the hierarchical
nanostructure, which can provide large surface areas and short diffusion
pathways for electrons and ions. By using the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4/Ni foam as the positive electrode
and activated carbon/Ni foam as the negative electrode, a hybrid supercapacitor
device is fabricated. The device achieves an energy density of 35.6
W h kg–1 and a power density of 1.5 kW kg–1 at 2 A g–1.

Introduction
In recent years, with
the rapid development of electric vehicles
and consumer electronic products, the requirements for electrical
energy storage devices are ever-growing. Supercapacitors and secondary
batteries are regarded as major electrical energy storage devices.
Compared with the widely used secondary batteries such as lithium-ion
batteries, supercapacitors possess the advantages including high power
density, long cycle life, and improved safety,1−8 but suffer from drawbacks such as low energy density. To meet the
requirement of actual applications, much effort is still needed to
improve the energy density of supercapacitors while maintaining a
high power density and a long cycle life.

Electrode materials
are decisive on the performance of supercapacitors.
Transition metal oxides and sulfides such as NiCo2O4 and NiCo2S4 have been widely studied
as electrode materials for supercapacitors.9−16 Unlike carbon materials, which store charges via electric double-layer
mechanism, transition metal oxides and sulfides store charges via
reversible faradic redox reactions, and can achieve much higher specific
capacitances than that of carbon materials.17−20 As the faradic redox reactions
mainly occur on the surface of electrode materials, it is necessary
to develop electrode materials with large surface areas and short
diffusion pathways for electrons and ions. Nanostructures such as
nanosheets and porous nanowires have been well studied for supercapacitors
because they can provide large surface areas and short diffusion pathways
for electrons and ions.21−24 Recently, some hierarchical nanocomposite materials
have been developed for supercapacitor applications.25−29 In the hierarchical nanocomposite materials, different materials
with various nanostructures are combined together. The synergistic
effects result in improved electrochemical performances than that
of the individual constituents.

The energy density of supercapacitors
is proportional to the square
of working voltage, and a higher working voltage means a higher energy
density.30 However, the working voltage
of symmetric supercapacitor is restricted by the stable potential
window of water when aqueous electrolyte is used. To increase the
working voltage of supercapacitors, hybrid supercapacitors are developed.
In hybrid supercapacitors, a faradic-type material acts as the positive
electrode and a capacitor-type material acts as the negative electrode.31−35 Because of the different working mechanism of the positive and negative
electrode materials, the working voltage of hybrid supercapacitors
can be obviously increased. The development of high-performance electrode
materials for hybrid supercapacitors is still of great interest.

In this work, a hierarchical core–shell NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite is synthesized
by a multistep process. In the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite, NiCo2S4 nanosheets are supported on NiCo2O4 porous
nanowires. Owing to the excellent structural advantages such as large
specific surface areas, short diffusion pathways, and absence of aggregation,
the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite
shows enhanced supercapacitor performances over NiCo2O4 porous nanowires. The hierarchical NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite can be used as
a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitor applications.

Results
and Discussion
The synthesis of hierarchical NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite was realized
through a multistep
process, as illustrated in Figure 1. First, a precursor was grown on Ni foam by using
Ni(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2, and
CO(NH2)2 as raw materials through a hydrothermal
process. Then, the precursor was converted to NiCo2O4 through calcination under ambient atmosphere. Finally, NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite
was obtained by treating NiCo2O4 in the atmosphere
of thioacetamide solution under hydrothermal condition. The composition
of the products obtained at different stages is studied by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) technique. The diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of the precursor
(Figure S1a, Supporting Information) can
be indexed to Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O (JCPDS card no. 48-0083) and Ni2(OH)2CO3·H2O (JCPDS card no. 38-0714). The
XRD pattern of the product obtained by calcining the precursor under
ambient atmosphere (Figure S1b) can be
indexed to spinel NiCo2O4 (JCPDS card no. 73-1702).
The formation of NiCo2O4 is a result of the
decomposition and oxidation of the precursor through calcination.
The XRD pattern of the final NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 sample is shown in Figure 2. In addition to the diffraction peaks of
NiCo2O4, some weak diffraction peaks of NiCo2S4 are also present. This can be attributed to
the low content and poor crystalline of NiCo2S4 in the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 sample.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the fabrication process of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite.

Figure 2 XRD pattern of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite.

The morphology of the products obtained at different stages
is
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The SEM image (Figure S2) of the precursor at low magnification shows that a layer of precursor
is evenly covered on the surface of Ni foam. A SEM image of the precursor
at higher magnification is shown in Figure 3a, and many nanowires with uniform size can
be seen. A TEM image of the precursor is shown in Figure 3b. The nanowire is solid and
its surface is smooth. Figure 3c shows the SEM image of the NiCo2O4 obtained by calcining the precursor under ambient atmosphere. The
nanowire morphology of the precursor is retained after calcination.
However, the TEM image of the NiCo2O4 nanowire
shown in Figure 3d
reveals a porous structure. The formation of the porous structure
can be ascribed to the volume shrink and the release of gaseous species
during the decomposition of the precursor.

Figure 3 (a, b) SEM and TEM images
of the precursor and (c, d) SEM and TEM
images of the NiCo2O4 nanowires.

Figure 4a,b shows
the typical SEM images of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite at different magnifications. The
NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite
shows a hierarchical structure in which NiCo2S4 nanosheets are attached on NiCo2O4 nanowires.
The TEM image of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite in Figure 4c further illustrates the hierarchical structure. A
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of
the outer nanosheet is shown in Figure 4d. The interplanar spacing of the lattice fringes is
about 0.23 nm, which corresponds to the (400) lattice plane of NiCo2S4.

Figure 4 (a, b) SEM, (c) TEM, and (d) HRTEM images of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite.

The chemical states of the component
elements in NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite are assessed
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique. The peaks at
169.7, 529.5, 781.5, and 855.7 eV in the XPS survey spectrum (Figure S3) correspond to S 2p, O 1s, Co 2p, and
Ni 2p, respectively, which indicates the presence of S, O, Co, and
Ni elements in the sample. Figure 5 shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni, Co,
O, and S elements. These peaks were fitted by using Gaussian fitting
method. The Ni 2p XPS spectrum shown in Figure 5a contains Ni 2p1/2, Ni 2p3/2, and two shake-up satellite peaks. Both Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 peaks are fitted into two peaks. The peaks
at 856.4 and 874.3 eV belong to Ni3+, whereas the peaks
at 855.4 and 872.9 eV belong to Ni2+.36 This result suggests the coexistence of both Ni2+ and Ni3+ in the sample. Figure 5b shows the Co 2p XPS spectrum. Similar to
the Ni element, the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks
are fitted into peaks corresponding to Co3+ and Co2+, revealing the coexistence of both Co2+ and Co3+ in the sample.36 The O 1s XPS
spectrum is shown in Figure 5c, the peak at 529.2 eV is typical of metal–oxygen
binding,37 the peak at 531.2 eV is attributed
to hydroxyl that come from water vapor in the air, and the peak at
531.7 eV is attributed to oxygen in the low-valence state.38,39 As compared to the O 1s XPS spectrum of NiCo2O4 nanowires (Figure S4), the peak at 529.2
eV is much weaker. This can be explained by the fact that in the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite,
the NiCo2O4 are encapsulated by NiCo2S4. Figure 5d shows the S 2p XPS spectrum, which contains a main peak and a satellite
peak. The main peak at 162.7 eV can be attributed to the sulfur ions
that bonded with metal ions.36

(d) S 2p.

The specific surface area and
pore size distribution of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite
are measured by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms,
as shown in Figure 6a. The isotherm with significant hysteresis loops can be attributed
to type IV isotherms. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite is 58.849 m2 g–1, which is higher than that of the NiCo2O4 nanowires
(53.892 m2 g–1, Figure S5). The higher specific surface area of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite can be
attributed to the existence of thin NiCo2S4 nanosheets
in the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite. Figure 6b shows the pore size distribution of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method. The pore diameter is mainly around 8 nm. The above results
confirm the porous nature of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite. When the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite was applied as
the electrode material for supercapacitors, the porous structure can
provide a large surface area for faradic redox reactions, and the
pore size is suitable for ion transportation.

and desorption isotherms of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite.

The unique vapor-phase hydrothermal process in the second
step
is crucial for the formation of the hierarchical structure of NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite.
If the NiCo2O4 nanowires were immersed in the
thioacetamide solution in the second step, only NiCo2S4 nanotubes can be obtained (Figure S6). To understand the formation mechanism of the hierarchical structure
of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite, a series of time-dependent experiments were done. Figure 7 shows the SEM images
of the products obtained by treating NiCo2O4 nanowires in the atmosphere of thioacetamide solution under hydrothermal
condition at 120 °C for different periods of time. After treating
for only an hour, no noticeable change can be seen, as shown in Figure 7a. This is possibly
due to the slow temperature rise of the autoclave. When the reaction
time reaches 2 h, some nanosheets start to evolve on the surface of
NiCo2O4 nanowires, as indicated from Figure 7b. With the reaction
time further prolonging, the nanosheets grow larger (Figure 7c). After 6 h, the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite
with an obvious hierarchical structure can be obtained (Figure 7d). According to the above
results, we believe that the reaction between NiCo2O4 and H2S in the atmosphere of thioacetamide solution
is slower than that in the solution. During the reacting process,
the outer layer of the NiCo2O4 nanowires is
gradually converted to NiCo2S4 nanosheets. Finally,
the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite
with a hierarchical structure is obtained.

reaction times, (a) 1 h, (b) 2 h, (c) 4 h, and (d) 6 h.

The NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite is applied as an electrode material for
supercapacitors.
The electrochemical performances are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) methods. Figure 8a shows a series
of CV curves of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode measured in a three-electrode cell with the
scan rates in the range of 10–100 mV s–1.
All of the CV curves show significant redox peaks, indicating the
pseudocapacitive characteristics of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 active material. As the scan rate
increases, the magnitude of the current response increases, and the
anodic and cathodic peaks shifts to more a positive and negative potential,
respectively. The GCD curves of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode at current densities in the range
of 1–10 A g–1 are shown in Figure 8b. The GCD curves appear as
obvious platforms during the charging and discharging process, which
can be attributed to the redox reactions occurring in the process
of charging and discharging. The IR drop in the GCD curves can be
attributed to the internal resistance of the electrode. The capacitances
of the electrode can be calculated by using the following equations.40 1  where Cs (F g–1) is the specific capacitance, I (A)
is the current during the discharge process, Δt (s) is the discharge time, ΔV (V) is the
potential window, and m (g) is the mass of the active
materials. When the current densities are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A
g–1, the specific capacities are 1872, 1808, 1720,
1632, 1456, and 1320 F g–1, respectively. With increase
in the current density from 1 to 10 A g–1, the capacitance
retention of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode is about 70.5%, suggesting a good rate capability. Figure 8c shows the comparative
GCD curves of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode and the NiCo2O4 electrode
at a current density of 1 A g–1. It is obvious that
the discharging time of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode is much longer than that of the NiCo2O4 electrode. The specific capacitance of the NiCo2O4 electrode is only 722 F g–1 at 1 A g–1.

behavior of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode at 5 A g–1 for 4000 cycles. (e)

Cycling stability of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode was
tested at a current density of
5 A g–1 for 4000 GCD cycles, and the results are
displayed in Figure 8d. With the increase in cycles, the capacitance slowly deteriorates.
After 4000 cycles, a capacitance retention of about 65% is achieved.
The deterioration of capacitance during the cycling process can be
attributed to the oxidation of NiCo2S4 in alkaline
electrolytes.41 The electrochemical impedance
spectra of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 electrodes were tested
in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an amplitude of 5
mV. The Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 8e. All of the plots contain a negligible
semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line in the
low-frequency region. The semicircle reflects the charge-transfer
resistance in the electrode–electrolyte interface.42 The negligible semicircle in the plots indicates
that the charge-transfer resistance of the two electrodes is very
low. This result can be attributed to the direct growth of the electrode
materials on the Ni foam. The sloping straight line in the low-frequency
region reflects the Warburg impedance. The slope of the lines reveals
the diffusion rates of the electrolyte ions into the electrode materials.43 The slopes of about 49.1 and 67.2° of the
straight lines implies an efficient electrolyte and proton diffusion
in the electrode materials.

To evaluate the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 electrode for practical
application, a hybrid supercapacitor
device was assembled by using the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite as the positive electrode material,
activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode material, and a 3
mol L–1 KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte.
As indicated from the CV curves of the positive and negative electrode
materials measured in the three-electrode cell (Figure 9a), the working potential windows of the
positive and negative electrode materials are in different regions.
Therefore, the working potential window of the hybrid supercapacitor
can be extended because of the complementary of the working potential
windows of the positive and negative electrode materials. Figure 9b displays a series
of CV curves of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4//AC hybrid supercapacitor in a potential range of 0–1.6
V at the scan rates of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s–1. With the increase in the scan rate, the CV curves retain the similar
shape, indicating that the hybrid supercapacitor could stably work
in such a wide potential window. Figure 9c displays the GCD curves of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4//AC hybrid supercapacitor
at the current densities from 2 to 10 A g–1. The
shape of the charge and discharge curves is nonlinear due to the occurrence
of faradic redox reactions. The specific capacitances of the hybrid
supercapacitor are 114, 83, 64, 50, and 46 F g–1 at the current densities of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A g–1. The cycling stability of the device was measured at the current
density of 4 A g–1 for 2000 GCD cycles (Figure 9d). The specific
capacitance reaches a maximum of 131 F g–1 after
200 cycles, and then slowly decreases. After 2000 cycles, the specific
capacitance of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4//AC device is 103 F g–1, which is about
78% of the maximum value. The energy density (E)
and the power density (P) of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4//AC device can be calculated
according to the following equations.44 2   3  Figure 9e shows the Ragone plot of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4//AC device. At a current
density of
2 A g–1, the energy density and the power density
of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4//AC device are 35.6 W h kg–1 and 1.5 kW kg–1, respectively. At the current density of 10 A g–1, the energy density and the power density of the
device are 14.4 W h kg–1 and 7.5 kW kg–1, respectively. Finally, a light-emitting diode (LED) is successfully
illumed by two series connected NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4//AC devices (Figure 9f), which further proves the possibility
of the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite for practical charge storage applications.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite with a hierarchical
structure was prepared
by a multistep process. The vapor-phase hydrothermal process in the
second step is crucial for the formation of NiCo2S4 nanosheets on the surface of NiCo2O4 porous nanowires. The hierarchical NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite has excellent structural
advantages such as large specific surface areas and short diffusion
pathways for electrolyte ions. When acting as an electrode material
for supercapacitor, the NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite shows much enhanced supercapacitor performances
than that of the NiCo2O4 porous nanowires. The
experimental results indicate that the hierarchical NiCo2O4@NiCo2S4 nanocomposite is suitable
for high-performance supercapacitor applications.

Experimental
Section
All of the chemical reagents were purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. The purity of these chemical reagents was of analytical
grade.

Synthesis of NiCo2O4 Nanowires Array on
Ni Foam
A piece of Ni foam with a size of 2 cm × 2 cm
was washed with 3 mol L–1 hydrochloric acid, acetone,
ethanol, and deionized water in sequence. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.291 g, 1 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.582 g, 2 mmol), and CO(NH2)2 (0.420 g, 7 mmol) were together dissolved in 40 mL deionized

immersed in the solution. After that, the autoclave was sealed and
heated at 120 °C for 6 h. The precursor-loaded Ni foam was fully
washed with deionized water, dried under vacuum at 50 °C for
2 h, and then calcined in an ambient atmosphere at 380 °C for
2 h.
