Colloidal
crystals are encountered in a variety of energy-harvesting
applications, where they serve as waveguides or filters for electromagnetic
and electro-optic energy. Techniques such as electric or magnetic
assembly are used to assemble colloidal crystals, but are limited
by crystal size, yield, and throughput. This article demonstrates
the continuous, high-throughput assembly of two-dimensional (2D)-colloidal
crystals in an acoustofluidic flow cell. The device is fabricated
using off-the-shelf components and does not require a clean-room access.
An experimental state diagram shows how the fluid flow rate and voltage
applied to the piezoelectric element in our device can tune the crystal
microstructure. Highly ordered colloidal crystals are continuously
assembled in less than a minute with a throughput yield of several
hundred particles per minute using this device. The acoustically assembled
ordered 2D crystals are immobilized using a UV-curable resin and extracted
as ordered polymer–particle fibers, demonstrating the ability
of using acoustic fields to assemble ordered structures embedded in
bulk materials. Particle tracking is used to construct the cross-channel
particle distribution to understand the effect of acoustic compression
on colloidal crystal assembly. Microparticle image velocimetry data
is compared to a theoretical transport model to quantify the effect
fluid flow and acoustic trapping has on the colloidal crystal ensemble.

Introduction
Manufacturing defect-free
ordered materials are immensely important
for producing materials with applications to energy-harvesting1−4 components for subdiffraction limited imaging5 or as waveguides6 for electromagnetic
energy due to their unique physical and chemical properties, when
compared to their bulk counterparts.7−9 Assembling ordered structures
using individual colloidal particles as building blocks is a bottom-up
manufacturing process, where colloids form ordered microstructures
in the presence of an externally applied field (e.g., electric,10−12 magnetic,13−16 and acoustic17−20). External fields offer a pathway toward mediating self-assembly
due to short assembly time scales and controllability. Externally
driven self-assembly processes can form single crystals in a short
span of time,21 typically ranging from
a few seconds to a few hours.22 Particles
can be controlled and positioned individually using feedback methods
or annealing techniques, allowing for external control of crystal
growth.23,24 However, the assembly is conducted in small
batches with limited material throughput,18,21,23,25 making it
difficult to produce bulk materials at the scale required for many
applications. Producing ordered materials in bulk using batch production
increases the manufacturing time and complexity of production, as
materials are processed in small batches and then assembled separately
to form bulk materials. External fields require specific material
properties (e.g., dielectric, ferro- or paramagnetic) to drive the
assembly of sedimented microparticles in solution to form two-dimensional
(2D) ordered structures. Many of the external field techniques require
photolithography to fabricate electrodes to generate the required
external field patterns, which increases cost and device complexity
due to the clean-room operations and expensive equipment required
for lithography techniques and to conduct the experiment.

In
comparison to other directed techniques, acoustically driven
self-assembly can be done on a variety of materials, as sound waves
exert a mechanical force on the particles and do not require specific
electrical, magnetic, or chemical material properties. An acoustically
driven system only requires a difference in density and material compressibility
between the colloidal particles and solution to drive assembly.17,26 Complex microstructures can be obtained using acoustic wave interference
that can be created using off-the-shelf piezoelectric elements, eliminating
the need for photolithography.17,18,27 Particles assemble at the nodes (or antinodes) in the acoustic field,
irrespective of the geometry of the experimental assembly chamber
or electrodes. Hence, an acoustically directed assembly does not require
electrodes with complex geometries for assembly, eliminating the need
for complex photolithography equipment and clean-room settings.28 Acoustically driven assembly can be done using
off-the-shelf devices, making the process affordable and accessible.29 Acoustic fields act over large areas (∼1000
mm2), enabling large-scale assembly of colloidal particles,30−32 as opposed to the nano- or micrometer-sized batch assemblies demonstrated
using other externally directed assemblies. Acoustic fields drive
particles to assemble over short time periods,17,18,28 making the process suitable for continuous
throughput production of colloidal crystals.

This article presents
a continuous, high-throughput process for
producing ordered 2D colloidal crystal structures using acoustofluidic
self-assembly of microparticles, using off-the-shelf components, without
the need to access a clean room. Fifteen micrometer, non-Brownian
polystyrene microparticles dispersed in water are continuously introduced
to a glass capillary microfluidic flow cell with a syringe pump. A
piezoelectric element attached to the side of the capillary generates
an acoustic standing wave inside the microfluidic flow cell. We image
the particles at approximately 20 mm from the inlet, by which point
sedimentation has caused the particles to settle on the bottom of
the capillary. The acoustic standing wave drives sedimented microparticles
to assemble at acoustic nodes. Acoustofluidic devices based on glass
capillaries have been used to trap Brownian particles31 (∼6 μm) and nanoparticles down to 500 nm.33

An experimental state diagram shows the
effect that the fluid flow
rate and applied acoustic pressure have on the assembled microstructure.
Highly ordered, continuous crystals observed to assemble in less than
a minute with a yield throughput rate of several hundred particles
per minute were observed under various pressures and flow rates. Finally,
the ability to fabricate a bulk material using an acoustically directed
assembly is demonstrated by freezing the acoustically assembled particles
in a UV-curable resin continuously through the acoustic cell to form
ordered microparticle–polymer threadlike structures.

Particle tracking software is used to identify the location of
microparticles assembled in ordered structures. This data is used
as part of a cross-channel distribution analysis to understand the
compressive influence that the acoustic pressure has on the observed
structures. The flow cell throughput is quantified using the microparticle
image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of optical video microscopy data.
The degree of order within the assembled structures is quantified
by calculating the experimental order parameter and comparing the
number of nearest neighbors to theoretical expectations for an ideal
ordered structure.

The approach described in the article can
be used to support materials
applications for non-Brownian microparticles. Microparticles on the
15 μm diameter scale can influence the optical transmission
of white light as long as the particles themselves are part of a superassembly
(i.e., composed of other, smaller particles).34 The use of larger particles also offers the possibility of manipulating
longer wavelength electromagnetic energy (e.g., near IR emissions),
which can only be done by fabricating inverse opal structures.35 This is a challenge due to the fast sedimentation
times associated with large diameter colloids. Assembled non-Brownian
microparticles are used as a scaffold support material to fabricate
immunoassays for the detection of biological molecules.36 Non-Brownian microparticles can act as filler
material for polymer composites for enhancing mechanical properties.37 The mechanical properties can be tuned over
a wide range of Young’s modulus if the particles are internally
ordered.38

Unlike previous demonstrations
of batch self-assembly driven by
acoustic fields,17,30 the flow-through reactor platform
we describe here is capable of using acoustic fields to continuously
assemble colloidal particles on the order of several hundred particles
per minute. The flow-through reactor configuration of our microfluidic
cell lends itself well to additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping
platforms, leading to an increase in throughput, material yield, reduced
operating costs, and improved production time. Future work will focus
on mitigating defects in assembled structures and applying this platform
to additive manufacturing of polymer–particle composites, where
the degree of order between particles can influence composite mechanical38 or optical39 properties.

Results
Acoustic
Force
Acoustic waves produced by a mechanically
oscillating force will transport particles to nodes (or antinode)
depending on differences in particle–fluid density and compressibility.
In our experiment, colloidal crystals are assembled in a capillary
using an acoustic standing wave generated by a piezoelectric element.
Upon applying the acoustic field, the colloidal particles assemble
at the acoustic node (i.e., the region of minimum acoustic energy),
forming colloidal crystals. The acoustic cell fabrication and setup
are discussed in the Experimental Setup section.

Acoustic energy is dominantly influenced by the compressibility
and density of the fluid–particle system. The acoustic energy
exerted on a small particle by an acoustic wave is given by17,40 1   2   3  where Ucomp represents
the energy contribution due to the compressibility mismatch between
the particle and solution resulting from the local acoustic pressure
and Udens models how the acoustic energy
acts on the fluid–solid system when there is a density mismatch,
whereas P is the acoustic wave pressure, Vp is the volume of the particle, ρ is
the density, c is the velocity of sound, β
is the compressibility, λ is the wavelength, and k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber. The subscripts s and f represent
the solid particle and fluid, respectively. The angled brackets represent
the time-averaged pressure, where P(x) = Po cos(kx) sin(ωt) represents a model for acoustic
pressure distribution our device. The prefactor, Po, is the pressure wave magnitude, and ω is the
pressure wave frequency. Colloidal particles in an acoustic field
assemble at the node or antinode, depending on the acoustic contrast
factor of the particle–fluid system. The acoustic contrast
factor is defined by eq 4 4  where ρ is the density, β is the
compressibility. The subscripts s and f represent the solid particle
and fluid, respectively.

The normalized acoustic pressure distribution
and the corresponding
normalized acoustic energy distribution in our capillary system are
shown in Figure 1A,B,
respectively. A detailed explanation of the energy and pressure equations
defined to simulate the field distribution is described in the Supporting Information. In our experiment, a
single node is formed in the center of the capillary using a sine
wave, creating at the point of 0 acoustic pressure and minimum energy
point within the capillary. This minimum energy zone in the center
of the capillary occupies the full length of the capillary, which
helps assemble the colloidal particles into ordered crystals.

and (B) the acoustic energy arising from the pressure distribution

State Diagram
The acoustic contrast factor is positive
for the system examined in this work (Φ = 0.393) on the basis
of the density and compressibility values of water and polystyrene
stated in the Supporting Information. The
larger effect of density over compressibility based on the acoustic
contrast factor leads particles to assemble at the standing wave node
located in the center of the capillary. The particles’ assembly
time varied from 30–40 s to up to 2–3 min, depending
on the applied acoustic pressure and flow conditions. The assembly
was examined at three different voltages (60, 80, and 99 Vpp) and flow rates (1, 3, and 5 mL/h) to understand the effect of acoustic
compression and flow rate on microstructure, as shown in the state
diagram in Figure 2 for a fixed nominal resonance frequency of 830 kHz.

Figure 2 State diagram of the
assembled microstructures observed at various
applied voltages (60, 80, and 99 Vpp) and flow rates (1,
3, and 5 mL/h). Scale bar is 100 μm.

In this experiment, because we are using non-Brownian microparticles,
nucleation and 2D crystal formation occur solely due to the packing
of spherical particles induced by acoustophoretic transport to the
acoustic node. Nucleation of non-Brownian microparticles into hexagonally
close-packed structures was previously observed as a result of ultrasound
energy input.41 Péclet numbers calculated
in Table S1 also indicate that transport
is primarily convection driven as opposed to Brownian motion. As the
applied voltage increases, the increasing acoustic pressure on the
colloidal particles induces hexagonal close-packing. Particles form
crystals but have line and point defects in the 1 mL/h case when voltage
is applied at 60 Vpp. At 80 Vpp and 1 mL/h,
we observe the formation of a colloidal crystal with less defects,
as shown in Movie 1, Supporting Information.
Increasing the voltage to 99 Vpp resulted in an ordered
crystal that was acoustically trapped at the node. The crystal did
not flow as seen in the 60 and the 80 Vpp cases, as shown
in Movie 2, Supporting Information. Because
of the high compression, the particles did not have time to rearrange
and the defects were formed.

Similar behavior was observed at
several other flow rates. At a
flow rate of 3 mL/h, particles formed a partially close-packed system.
As we increased the voltage further, crystals with line defects were
formed at 80 Vpp. Upon increasing the voltage to 99 Vpp, a close-packed structure was observed. At a flow rate of
5 mL/h, particles do not form a close-packed structure at 60 Vpp, as the applied acoustic compression is not sufficient to
form a close-packed structure with the increased flow rate. As we
increase the applied acoustic pressure, a partially formed crystal
and a close-packed microstructure can be observed at 80 and 99 Vpp, respectively.

We observed that as the flow rate increases,
the order decreases.
A clear demonstration of the effect of the flow rate can be observed
at 60 Vpp case in the 1, 3, and 5 mL/h cases. A crystal
microstructure is observed at 1 mL/h. At 3 mL/h, a randomly ordered
microstructure is formed and at 5 mL/h, a random aggregate is formed,
showing that the degree of crystallinity decreases with an increase
in the flow rate. The effect of increase in the flow rate on the crystal
structure from 1 to 5 mL/h at 99 Vpp can be seen in Movies 2–4,
Supporting Information. The crystal formation behaves similar to the
crystal kinetics observed previously in results for shear flow colloidal
crystal kinetics.42 The 80 Vpp case has behavior similar to that in the 60 Vpp case
where a crystalline microstructure is formed at 1 mL/h, followed by
a randomly close-packed microstructure at 3 mL/h and finally, a random
aggregate for the 5 mL/h case. At 99 Vpp, the 1 and 3 mL/h
cases show a close-packed crystal and the 5 mL/h case shows the formation
of a small crystallite, demonstrating that acoustic compression is
the dominating force compared with the fluid flow at increased applied
voltage.

An increased flow rate also increases the rate of crystal
formation
due to enhanced mass transport. However, above a critical flow rate,
it was observed that the crystal formation rate decreases as the flow
rate increases. This is a result of flow-displaced crystallized microstructures,
where incoming particles do not have adequate time to assemble into
close-packed structures. This leads to a decrease in the degree of
hexagonal close-packing. We observe this in the case of acoustic assembly
at 7 mL/h, where assembly does not occur at 60, 80, or 99 Vpp. When the acoustic field is switched on, an ordered structure can
form given sufficient time and particle concentration. However, the
fluid flow transports particles faster than they are able to nucleate
into crystalline structures, leading to random dispersions like the
one shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information.

Polystyrene bead concentration varied due to stochastic addition
of particles to the acoustofluidic device during pumping. A decreasing
concentration tends to a decreased degree of hexagonal close-packing
and increased assembly time. Particles are transported to the acoustic
node irrespective of how low the particle concentration is at all
of the voltages and flow rates. Although sample concentration affects
crystallization, the acoustic field driving particles to assemble
at the node acting to locally concentrate the particles is the most
critical factor in determining the degree of hexagonal close-packing.

Defect Formation
During assembly, we observe defects
(e.g., grain boundaries, line, or point defects) and occasionally,
curved microstructures, as shown in Figure 3A. Some of these defects arise temporarily
from shear slip planes while the crystals assemble and dynamically
reach equilibrium under flow. Figure 3B shows the formation of one slip plane as it reorients
into a crystalline grain in Figure 3C. Figure 3D shows the radial distribution graph of the slip plane shown
in Figure 3B. Tail-like
structures can be observed on the region showing the nearest neighbors,
denoting a slip plane. Figure 3E shows the radial distribution curve of the reoriented crystal,
and the tail-like structures are not found on the nearest neighbors,
except in the case of the top and bottom distribution points, denoting
the recombination of the slip plane. The tail seen in the top and
bottom distribution points is due to the shear flow distortion in
the microstructure.43 The slip planes that
form in this way influence the placement of incoming particles and
crystal grain orientations, which leads to the observed crystal curvature.
The formation and reorientation of the slip plane can be seen in Movie 5, Supporting Information.

and line) and grain boundaries form

microstructure shows secondary peaks distorting the microstructure

two-dimensional radial distribution shows that the secondary peaks
have subsided, leaving only peaks distorted by the flow.

Crystal Formation in UV-Curable Resin
To demonstrate
the ability to fabricate composite materials using our acoustic assembly
approach, we assemble microparticles in a UV-curable resin. The polystyrene
beads are stored in an aqueous solution, and these beads will not
form a stable mixture when dispersed in the resin. For demonstration
purposes, we used poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microparticles
drawn from a powder and dispersed in the UV resin. The PMMA microparticles
suspended in the UV-resin solution assemble at a flow rate of 2 mL/h,
an applied voltage of 85 Vpp, and a frequency of 848 kHz.
The UV resin is cured in UV light for 2 min and 30 s to freeze the
crystals, as shown in Figure 4A. We extracted a sample polymer fiber that is 7.8 mm in length
and 0.94 mm in diameter. The resin–particle structures were
extracted continuously because the UV curing was done at the end of
the tubing. So the UV resin inside the tubing was not cured at any
point and was flowing out continuously.

ordered microparticles at 1×, which
was extruded as a threadlike structure. The scale bar is 2 mm. (B)
Ordered PMMA microparticles embedded in the polymer fiber at 10×.
The scale bar is 250 μm. (C) A monolayer of ordered microparticles
assembled in the polymer at 40×. The scale bar is 50 μm.
The PMMA particles form a monolayer of ordered structures on the resin
surface (D) due to acoustic assembly and not due to particle concentration,
which is demonstrated by sample rotation. On rotation, the particle
layer gradually disappears (E, F) and no particles are visible on
the opposite face of the sample (G). The scale bar for figures (D)–(G)
is 500 μm.

Figure 4B shows
a 10× magnified image of the acoustically assembled particle
assembly in the resin. Continuous close-packed structures can be observed
to form a single layer around the polymer fiber, as shown in a 180°
view of the sample shown in Movie 6, Supporting
Information. We observe that particles assembled only across a part
of the sample and are not distributed randomly across the surface
area of the sample. The 40× magnified image of the assembly shows
the resin seep in between particles, demonstrating the interparticle
bonding of the beads, as shown in Figure 4C. Figure 4D–G shows various rotated positions of the resin
fiber, demonstrating a single layer of assembled particles. Figure 4D shows the assembled
particles on the surface of the string. Upon rotation, two sections
of the polymer and assembled beads can be observed, as shown in Figure 4E,F, showing that
the close-packing of particles is due to the acoustic force and not
due to fluid shear or particle concentration effects. Upon further
rotation, as shown in Figure 4G, the assembled particles are no longer visible and only
the resin along with a few random particles is visible, showing that
the particles are assembled in a single layer around the resin structure.
The position of the particles around the resin demonstrates that the
assembly occurs at the bottom of the capillary in the acoustic cell
due to sedimentation.

The particle assembly demonstrated using
PMMA beads is not as uniform
as seen in the polystyrene bead assembly as the dry, unfunctionalized
PMMA particles are suspended in the resin solution, and so they do
not form a stable solution, as opposed to the functionalized polystyrene
solution we used. The PMMA beads are not monodisperse, and the difference
in particle sizes causes a nonhexagonal packing of the packing, as
shown in Figure 4C.

Discussion
Order Parameters
The average degree of hexagonal close-packing,
⟨C6⟩, is defined as the
average number of nearest neighbors of a particle in an ensemble.23 The number of nearest neighbors, Nic, for the
particle, i, surrounded by nearest neighbors, j, is calculated within a coordination distance, rc. The ensemble is considered to be crystalline
if the crystalline connectivity, χ6ij ≥ 0.32. So
the nearest neighbors for a given particle can be calculated using44 5  where χ6ij is defined in the Supporting Information. The average order parameter
for the ensemble containing N particles, ⟨C6⟩ is given by 6  Equations 5 and 6 are used to calculate
the experimental ensemble order parameter ⟨C6⟩ for the experiments shown in Figure 2. A detailed derivation of eq 6 is given in the Supporting Information.

In an ideal infinite
two-dimensional crystal composed of particles in a hexagonally close-packed
configuration, each particle will have six nearest neighbors. This
would yield an average ⟨C6⟩
value of 6 for the crystal. However, a crystal of a limited size and
aspect ratio reduces the ideal value of ⟨C6⟩ for the crystals assembled in this work. The
theoretical maximum value of ⟨C6⟩ for each of the conditions examined in our state diagram
was evaluated using eqs S31 and S32 in
the Supporting Information. The values for ideal ⟨C6⟩ range from 5 to 5.7 on the basis of the number
of particles assembled under the experimental conditions examined
here. Our results from this analysis (Figure 5A) indicate that only four cases (1 mL/h-60
Vpp, 1 mL/h-80 Vpp, 1 mL/h-99 Vpp, and 3 mL/h-99 Vpp) have a high degree of hexagonal order
(⟨C6⟩ ∼ 4 or greater),
whereas the remainder either exhibit significant polycrystalline order
or are completely random. The order parameters shown in Figure 5A have an error of less than
5% and are not represented in the graphs.

hexagonal close-packing observed during experimental
conditions. The experimental standard deviation was less than 5% of
the observed average. (B) Average order parameter with error bars
for the four best experimental conditions compared to the expected
order parameter theoretically expected on the basis of spherical packing.
(C) The percent error between the theoretical and expected values
from (B).

The order parameter generally
increases with an increased applied
voltage and a decreased flow rate, as shown in Figure 5A. At 1 mL/h, the experimentally observed
microstructures have an average ⟨C6⟩ that ranges from 4.39 to 4.67, exhibiting crystalline order
at all of the flow conditions. At 80 Vpp, the microstructure
undergoes rearrangement, which leads to highly ordered colloidal crystals
under these conditions. When the colloidal particles become acoustically
trapped at 99 Vpp, the acoustic compression immobilizes
the grains to form the observed microstructure. At these conditions,
the colloids do not have time to assemble into low-defect configurations,
leading to a polycrystalline microstructure. At 3 mL/h, ⟨C6⟩ increases with an increase in the
applied voltage, as the particles form a crystalline structure due
to acoustic compression, whereas at 5 mL/h, ⟨C6⟩ is the highest for the 60 Vpp case
compared to that in the 80 and 99 Vpp cases under the same
flow rate conditions. The numerical value for the ideal ⟨C6⟩ value is compared with the experimental
results for 1 mL/h-60 Vpp, 1 mL/h-80 Vpp, 1
mL/h-99 Vpp, and 3 mL/h-99 Vpp in Figure 5B. The error between the theoretical
and experimental values was found to range between 10 and 20%, as
shown in Figure 5C.
The error observed in our experimental cases arises from point defects,
line defects, and grain boundaries. Acoustic trapping and flow effects
also play a role in determining the degree of order in observed structures.

Bead Distribution across the Channel
We examine the
particle count distribution per captured frame across the capillary
to understand the degree of acoustic compression. The transverse x-locations for each particle center identified through
image analysis are used to construct a cross-channel bead distribution
histogram for all voltages and flow rates examined here. To compensate
for differences in optical position of the microscope stage and compare
histograms between experiments, we translated the coordinates of each
crystal data set. We did this by fitting a Gaussian distribution to
each histogram and translating each graph by the mean value.

As shown in Figure 6, at least 600–1300 particles can be assembled to form close-packed
structures in the acoustic cell at any given instant within the region
of observation, as opposed to the few tens of particles assembled
using externally directed assembly batch production techniques. The
number of particles in the capillary was obtained from the particle
tracking data histograms and is represented by the area under the
curves shown in Figure 6A–C. As the pressure of acoustic compression increases, the
transverse width of the observed microstructures decreases with an
increasing flow rate (Figure 6). Increasing acoustic compression drives colloidal particles
to form hexagonally close-packed crystals, which explains the reduction
in the width observed at 1 mL/h with increasing voltage (Figure 6A). At 3 and 5 mL/h,
the microstructures undergo a reduction in width as the fluid flow
stretches the entrained crystals. The trend with increasing voltage
observed at 1 mL/h is also observed with 5 mL/h. The voltage trend
deviates at 3 mL/h with 80 Vpp, exhibiting a thinner microstructure
than with 99 Vpp. We attribute this deviation to the stochastic
nature of particle addition to the capillary during the experiment
and variations in bead concentration during sample preparation. The
crystal curvature will also cause deviations in the observed particle
distribution.

80, and

Effect of the Flow Rate
on Crystallization
Microparticle
image velocimetry was used to evaluate the velocity of the colloids
that make up the crystals for the voltage and flow rate conditions
examined in Figure 2. The histogram count in the transverse velocity analysis shown in Figure 7B represents the
number of vectors of a given magnitude. The velocity vector distribution
(Nv) obtained by a PIV analysis was normalized
by the average number of velocity vectors for each case to obtain
the vector density (Nv,avg). PIV analysis
of each case shows that the average velocity increases with the flow
rate, as we see an average velocity of 5.7, 18.93, and 33.06 μm/s
for 1, 3, and 5 mL/h, respectively. The velocity for each of the nine
cases obtained from the micro-PIV analysis is tabulated in Table S1. The distribution of these velocities
in the direction of flow (Figure 7A) indicates that the input voltage does not appear
to have a strong effect on transport at 3 and 5 mL/h. The input voltage
has the strongest effect at 1 mL/h, where the crystal is acoustically
trapped at the node and longitudinal velocity is negligible. In a
few instances during our experiments, particles stuck to the capillary
wall caused other particles to move in the opposite direction of flow
as they tried to move around the obstacle. This situation sometimes
leads to negative values for longitudinal velocity.

Figure 7 Velocity distribution
measured by particle image velocimetry for
the cases shown in Figure 3. The longitudinal (z) and transverse (x) velocity distribution for 1 mL/h (A, B), 3 mL/h (C, D),
and 5 mL/h (E, F).

On the basis of the width
of the crystal and the velocity of the
particles in the direction of fluid flow, we estimated the particle
throughput per minute, (i.e., new particles being added to the flowing
crystal) to range from 300 to 1300 particles, as shown in Table S2 using eq S39 from the Supporting Information. The width of the crystal shown
in Figure 6 was accurate
in most cases when compared to the number of rows observed in the
state diagram and was considered to calculate the throughput using
the calculations described in the Supporting Information. However, in a several cases, the crystal was bent, resulting in
a slightly higher width than seen experimentally. In such cases, the
average number of rows seen in the experimental results was considered
to calculate the particle throughput.

The velocities observed
here are lower in comparison to what might
be expected at the flow rates examined here. Sedimentation within
the capillary occurs as the particles are non-Brownian. The Péclet
numbers evaluated for each case (Table S2) indicate that convection dominates the transport of particles in
our system. Sedimentation causes particles to settle near the capillary
wall, where hydrodynamic interactions with the capillary wall hinder
particle transport. The average height above the capillary wall is
estimated using eq 8,
which allows us to estimate the separation between the particle surface
and the wall.

The work by Goldman et al. provides us with a
way to interpret
microparticle image velocimetry data near the wall of the capillary.45 The particle translation velocity, up,z, is measured using optical video microscopy and normalized
by a factor of 7  where Γ is the effective shear rate
in the capillary. The dimensionless height, y/a, is a function of B, and we can use the
data from Goldman et al. to estimate this functional form as 8  Equation 8 provides us with a way to connect the measured
translation
velocity with the particle’s height above the capillary wall. Equations 7 and 8 are based on hydrodynamic calculations from Goldman et al.45 As the particles settle in flow, they achieve
a mechanical equilibrium between sedimentation and electrostatics
(see eq S1 in the Supporting Information).
Measuring the particle velocity and calculating the effective shear
yields the equilibrium height of the particle if eqs 7 and 8 are used. This
approach was used to measure the electrostatic interaction between
a glass surface and a non-Brownian particle entrained in flow.46 A detailed derivation of the expression is discussed
in the Supporting Information.

The
analysis suggests that the wall separation varies between ∼3
and 30 nm, as tabulated in Table S1. On
average, the wall separation increases with increasing flow rate,
suggesting that lift causes the particles to come off the wall. We
would expect the wall separation to be an order of magnitude higher
on the basis of similar hydrodynamic measurements in the literature;46 however, we attribute the discrepancy to several
factors. First, the hindrance factors reported here are for single
particles translating above a plane wall and the analysis neglects
the effects of hydrodynamics in the presence of multiple particles,
which would reduce particle mobility.

Second, our data suggests
that an acoustically generated force
maybe present normal to the capillary wall, as evidenced by the trapping
behavior at 1 mL/h and 99 Vpp. This component likely drives
particles down toward the wall, which also reduces particle mobility.
This normal force maybe present due to the fact that the piezoelectric
element is at a slight angle and is not perfectly perpendicular to
the capillary wall as a result of the manufacturing process. The piezoelectric
element tilts slightly as the epoxy used to glue the element dries.

Third, it has been shown theoretically that acoustic streaming
effects push the particles downward, which may push particles toward
the capillary wall, reducing the expected theoretical height.47 The combination of these effects slow particles
down and make them to appear as though they have a separation of ∼3–30
nm. The height in the 1 mL/h-99 Vpp case is not calculated
as the particles are trapped and no longer flow.

Acoustic Streaming
The transverse component of the
velocity (Figure 7B)
averages ∼0 μm/s with a negligible standard deviation.
This indicates that there is no detectable transport in the transverse
direction (i.e., perpendicular to the direction of flow) at steady
state, which indicates that significant flows driven by acoustic streaming
are not present in this direction. Rayleigh and Eckart streaming are
two mechanisms that may contribute to acoustic streaming effects in
our device scale. Fluid jets due to Eckart streaming are negligible
because our device is small and operates at a low frequency, which
reduces the fluid momentum generated by acoustic.48 Rayleigh streaming produces vortices, which we would expect
to have significant effect on crystal formation. Literature results
from a computational analysis found that the acoustic streaming effect
is more significant in the transverse x-direction
rather than in the longitudinal z-direction, where
the flow of fluid in the capillary is a more significant effect.47 It is possible that the velocity measured in
the longitudinal direction is a result of fluid flow due to pumping
and acoustic streaming; however, a more detailed study is necessary
to decouple the effect of these combined mechanisms.

Conclusions
We demonstrate a continuous flow colloidal crystal fabrication
system using acoustofluidic-driven self-assembly. The crystal microstructures
observed in this device arise from the combined effects of acoustic
compression and hydrodynamic stresses. As acoustic compression increases,
the colloidal particles hexagonally close pack to form ordered structures
while entrained in a fluid flow. However, we show that it is possible
to acoustically trap a crystal structure despite the presence of flow.
Microparticle image velocimetry is used to examine the transport of
colloidal crystals subject to fluid flow. The average particle velocity
and colloidal crystal throughput increase with the flow rate. However,
flow rates of 5 mL/h and higher increase particle velocity such that
crystalline microstructure is difficult or impossible to maintain
under the acoustic field conditions examined in this work. We compare
the observed and expected degree of hexagonal close-packing using
an order parameter analysis. Overall, the degree of hexagonal close-packing
increases with applied acoustic field strength and decreases with
the flow rate. We find that experimental structures have a degree
of order that deviates from expectations on the basis of spherical
packing by 10–20%. This deviation arises from the presence
of point and line defects, grain boundaries, acoustic trapping, and
flow effects.

The approach demonstrated here can serve as a
continuous flow reactor
to produce colloidal crystals with energy-harvesting applications.
Unlike batch assembly techniques, where the number of input particles
is fixed, our platform has a high-throughput yield of several hundred
particles per second. The use of off-the-shelf components to fabricate
the acoustofluidic cell is advantageous as the device costs less than
$20 and does not require any special processes like photolithography.
Experiments were done in normal lab conditions instead of a clean-room
setting, making it suitable for many applications while using minimal
laboratory equipment. The relatively small footprint of the device
makes it easy to integrate into complex fluid systems.

Future
work will focus on studying the optimum conditions necessary
to obtain uniform crystals cured in the resin and design the experimental
setup to obtain the resin–particle bonding without the excess
polymer demonstrated in this article. Integration of the platform
described here with additive manufacturing techniques will enable
the production of self-assembled materials on demand with unique material
properties. Our experimental setup does not allow us to directly observe
nucleation during assembly. We plan to streamline our experimental
cell to help us observe this process. Given the defects observed during
the experiment, it is necessary to understand the interplay between
forces (e.g., acoustic, hydrodynamic, and surface) and how these forces
influence assembly kinetics. A more detailed study of dislocation
dynamics using an updated experimental cell will allow us to develop
real-time annealing techniques to remove defects during crystal formation.

Materials
and Methods
Acoustic Cell Fabrication
The acoustic cell was prepared
using off-the-shelf components without the use of a clean room (Figure 8). A square borosilicate
glass capillary (Vitrocom, Catalog# 8100-100) with an inner side dimension
of 1 mm and wall thickness of 0.2 mm was cleaned using protocols established
for removing contaminants from glass capillaries.49 The glass capillary was immersed in 1% Sparkleen (Fisher
Scientific, Catalog# 04-320-4) solution at 80 °C for 30 min.
Sparkleen immersion is followed with immersion of the glass capillary
in deionized water for 30 min and drying using air. A lead zirconate
titanate piezoelement (APC International Inc., P-30.00 mm-5.00 mm-1.00
mm-841 WFB) was attached to the capillary using high-strength epoxy
(JB Weld Epoxy Steel Resin) and cured for 24 h at room temperature.

Figure 8 (Top)

colloidal crystals. (Bottom) A schematic representation of the acoustofluidic
device during operation.

The acoustofluidic device was fixed on a microscope slide
(Fisher
Scientific, 12-550-A3) using two poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) (Ellsworth
Adhesives, Part# 184 SIL ELAST KIT 0.5 kG) pillars, 5 mm in diameter
and 4 mm high, with epoxy to serve as the supporting element for the
capillary. First, the capillary is glued to the PDMS pillars using
epoxy (Devcon home 5-minute Epoxy) and is allowed to cure for 24 h.
Next, the tubing is glued to the ends of the capillary on both sides
and is allowed to cure for 24 h. The setup was allowed to cure for
an additional 24 h to ensure that epoxy (Devcon home 5-minute Epoxy)
completely bonded the acoustofluidic device to the PDMS pillars. Silicone
tubing (VWR International, Catalog# 16211-316) was attached on both
ends of the capillary using epoxy. The capillary and tubing are glued
at an interval of 24 h and are not glued immediately (as epoxy needs
only 15–20 min to set), as attaching the tubing to the capillary
immediately causes the capillary to bend, casting a shadow when viewed
through the microscope and affecting the imaging process.

Sample Preparation
Polystyrene beads with a 15 μm
diameter (Polysciences Inc., Cat# 18328) were used as building blocks
to form colloidal crystals. One hundred microliters of polystyrene
bead solution was suspended per 1 mL of deionized water sourced from
an ARIES High Purity Water System with a 0.2 μm filter (Aries
Filterworks).

UV-Resin–Microparticle Solution
Unfunctionalized,
dry PMMA particles (27–32 μm diameter) were purchased
from Cospheric (PMPMS-1.2 27–32 μm). The UV-curable resin
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (CPS 1030 UV-A). The resin was diluted
using acetone and isopropyl alcohol using a 1:1:1 ratio of the resin
and solvents to reduce the viscosity of the resin. The PMMA microparticles
were then added to the diluted resin solution.

Experimental Setup
The acoustic cell was fixed to an
optical microscope stage. The piezoelement on the acoustic cell was
driven with a sine function wave input using a wave function generator
(Agilent 33220A). A radio frequency (RF) amplifier (Electronics &
Innovation, 210L) with a maximum input of 1 Vrms was used
to amplify the signal input into the piezoelement. The amplitude and
frequency of the signal from the amplifier was monitored continuously
using an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TBS 1052B-EDU). A signal attenuator
(Tektronix P2220 Voltage Probe) was used on the oscilloscope to reduce
the possibility of damage on the oscilloscope due to high voltage
inputs. Two dummy loads of 1 W (Tektronix 011-0049-01) and 50 W (Pasternack
PE6234) were used with the wave function generator and the RF amplifier,
respectively, to ensure that the circuit remained closed at all times.

The polystyrene bead dispersion was interfaced with the acoustofluidic
device through the silicone tubing and introduced into the device
with a syringe pump (Lucca Technologies, GenieTouch). The acoustic
pressure was generated by applying various voltages to the piezoelement.
All experiments were conducted at peak-to-peak voltages of 60, 80,
and 99 Vpp as a direct input from the RF amplifier at a
fixed frequency of 830 kHz. The colloidal throughput was varied by
introducing the dispersion at flow rates of 1, 3, and 5 mL/h using
the syringe pump.

At the outlet of the tubing, a 48 W UV-light
source (SUNUV SUN2C
48 W LED UV lamp) ranging from 355 to 405 nm was set up and the device
was manually operated to be lit up for 4.5 min continuously to obtain
continuously cured resin structures. The assembly is cured while the
suspension is flowing. The UV lamp is placed at the end of the tubing,
and the flow rate and UV exposure time used in this experiment was
empirically determined so that the flowing UV resin with the acoustic
assembly was cured as it flowed out of the tubing. Our method works
as the resin is cured at the exit of the tubing and is not cured while
the resin is inside the tubing (which would lead to blocking). The
resin–polymer composite cure can be extracted as a continuous
process. The flow does not have to stop to extract the cured fibers.

Optical Microscopy and Analysis
An inverted optical
microscope (Olympus IX70) was used to observe the assembly process
at 10× magnification. Videos were recorded using a scientific
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera (QImaging, Optimos).
Five hundred frames of video were taken at a frame rate of 10 frames/s.
Each pixel in the recorded video was measured to be 885.6 nm with
a stage micrometer. The videos were processed and analyzed using the
MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox (Mathworks). Each frame was filtered
to remove noise before identifying centroid locations. The centroid
locations are written to a text file and saved for bead distribution
analysis. The images and video for the particle–resin sample
were taken using a Lumenera Infinity3 6UR camera mounted on an upright
microscope (Leica DM3000).

An open source particle image velocimetry
(PIV) package, PIVLab,50−52 was used to identify particle velocity distributions.
PIVLab uses a cross-correlation algorithm to calculate particle displacement
between two images. Before our images are processed by PIVLab, we
crop the frames to remove areas not occupied by beads to eliminate
spurious velocity vectors that arise from local intensity variations
caused by fluctuations in the light source. Seeding densities below
10 particles per interrogation area within an image will produce faulty
vectors for velocimetric data analysis.53 The cropped images are then filtered using a highpass filter and
a Wiener denoise filter prior to analysis. The PIV algorithm then
divides a frame into smaller interrogation areas and performs a correlation
between these areas and the same areas on a consecutive frame to calculate
the displacement of particles.
