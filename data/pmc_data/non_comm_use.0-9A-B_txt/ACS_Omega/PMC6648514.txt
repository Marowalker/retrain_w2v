Polymers reinforced
with nanofillers, especially graphene in recent
times, have continued to attract attention to realize novel materials
that are cheap and also have better properties. At a different level,
encapsulating liquid crystals (LCs) in polymer networks not only adds
mechanical strength, but could also result in device-based refractive
index mismatch. Here, we describe a novel strategy combining the best
of both these concepts to create graphene-incorporated polymer-stabilized
LC (PSLC) devices. The presence of graphene associated with the virtual
surface of the polymer network besides introducing distinct morphological
changes to the polymer architecture as seen by electron microscopy
brings out several advantages for the PSLC characteristics, which
include 7-fold lowered critical voltage, its temperature invariance,
and enhanced contrast ratio between field-off scattering/field-on
transparent states. The results bring to fore the importance of working
at very-dilute-concentration limits of the filler nanoparticles in
augmenting the desired properties. These observations open up a new
vista for polymer–graphene composites in the area of device
engineering, including substrate-free smart windows.

1 Introduction
Depending
on the characteristics of the imbibed nanoparticle (NP),
polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) can exhibit unique properties1−4 ranging from tunable plasmonic absorption5 to enhanced electrical conductivity.6 Improved mechanical properties7 and flammability8 have also been achieved by adding NPs that impart
strength and limit combustion, respectively, to the host polymer.
In addition to adding functionality to polymers, nanoparticle mobility
influences fundamental properties of the PNC, such as melt flow and
viscosity,9−13 as well as the effectiveness of self-healing materials to limit
crack propagation.14 Therefore, an improved
understanding of nanoparticle diffusion in polymer melts is of both
technological and fundamental importance.15 Carbonaceous nanofillers such as graphene16−19 and carbon nanotubes (CNT)20−22 are promising materials owing to their extraordinary physicochemical
properties. Development of polymer composites incorporating these
nanofillers depends on several features not limited to the properties
of the nanofillers, their dispersion within the confining polymer
matrix, interaction between the two, and any morphological changes
in the matrix.23−33

Devices based on confinement of nematic liquid crystals (LCs)
in
a polymeric matrix have huge potential for use in spatial light modulation
and electrically controlled transparency applications. Depending on
the concentration of the polymer content, they are divided into two
types: polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs), in which the polymer
content is higher than that of the liquid crystal, and polymer-stabilized
liquid crystals (PSLC), in which polymer is the minority component.
Owing to the higher polymer content, PDLCs have higher mechanical
strength, and thus are less prone to damage due to mechanical shocks.
But the threshold voltage, i.e., the minimum operating voltage for
the device to switch from the transparent ON state to the scattering
off state, is high, due to the large number of polymer strands, which
increase the anchoring strength of the system. But for PSLC, due to
lower polymer content, the threshold voltage is lower than that of
PDLC, but it is not as robust as PDLCs due to the lower concentration
of polymer. Thus, the challenge is to strengthen the polymer part
without adversely affecting the operating voltage. Obvious candidates
for the purpose are nanoparticles of appropriate kind. In point of
fact, substantial attempts34−36 have been made in investigating
the influence of nanoparticles on the LC properties, and effects,
including reduction in the threshold voltage, are observed in such
nanocomposites. However, with hardly any exception, these efforts
are based on pure liquid crystal composites and not on any polymeric
system.37 It may be mentioned that a combination
of PSLC-in-PDLC has been just reported38 to achieve the dual requirement of mechanical strength, but lower
operating voltage. It is notable that to achieve this, the authors
employed three different polymerizable monomers, a complex system
indeed: while two polymers provided the droplet morphology, the third
one gave the PSLC architecture. In contrast, the work described achieves
the same effect with just one monomer and a very low concentration
of graphene. However, the drastic reduction in the threshold voltage,
a parameter that is of fundamental importance from the device perspective,
is seldom seen. More importantly, none of these papers reported the
temperature invariance of the threshold voltage, a parameter that
certainly simplifies device driver fabrication.

Recently, we
have shown that carbon nanotubes can be exclusively
incorporated into the polymer bundles forming the PSLC network39 leading to quite attractive properties in terms
of the threshold behavior. In the present investigations, we develop
this concept by incorporating graphene into the polymer–LC
composite. It must be mentioned that previously attempts have been
made to have graphene with LC. One such work deployed graphene as
the electrode material, as a substitute for the standard indium tin
oxide electrode.40 In another report, Dierking
et al.37 mixed graphene with the liquid
crystal material and observed that there is, in fact, a slight increase
in the threshold voltage as well as the splay elastic constant. In
the present work, we employ graphene–LC in the polymer network,
and owing to its PSLC nature, we term it as PSGLC. Comparisons are
made between the host PSLC (bereft of graphene) and the PSGLC systems
in terms of its morphology (as imaged by scanning electron microscopy,
SEM) and electro-optic characteristics. The PSGLC does exhibit a characteristically
different morphology and more importantly, markedly enhanced electro-optic
features: substantially lowered threshold voltage, thermally invariant
threshold, and dynamic switching without backflow; each of these is
highly desirable and brings out the importance of graphene in the
medium. A feature that contrasts the present study with the previous
ones (e.g., ref (37)) is the realization that certain enhancements of the properties,
such as the lowering of the threshold, can be achieved by working
at very low concentrations of the filler material. A further novelty
that we highlight here is the powerful template technique: Create
the necessary polymer architecture with the required mechanical strength
and alignment, leech out the host, and introduce the desired operating
material. With this protocol, strengthening can be done with one set
of host nanocomposites, whereas for device operation, another optimized
host material is employed. Thus, the present studies bring in a generalization
to the concept of achieving drastically improved PSLC systems by keeping
the polymer content low but concomitantly make the polymer fibers
mechanically stronger. The generalization serves in two ways: (i)
any nano-soft composite can be used as the host and (ii) the electrical
characteristics of the nanostructure in the template creating host
does not limit the operation of the device. Combined with the expected
enhanced mechanical strength, these observations signify a novel approach
to have a robust PSLC system using minute quantities of carbon nanoforms.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Cell Preparation
Graphene
was prepared by exfoliation of graphite powder employing a mild oxidation
route adopted from Choi et al.41 The procedure
was slightly modified and briefly about 0.5 g of graphite powder was
mixed with 20 mL of a 1:3 mixture of HNO3 and H2SO4, followed by stirring at room temperature for 2 h.
The whole mixture was heated at 90 °C for 2 h and allowed to
cool down, followed by stirring overnight (12–15 h). During
this time, the color of the dispersion turned charcoal. The dispersion
was repeatedly washed by centrifugation until neutral pH was obtained.
Finally, the dispersion was filtered and washed with water and ethanol.
The product was collected and dried in vacuum. The final product had
a grayish color and was not as shiny as the starting graphite. The
flakes thus obtained were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
characterization data are given in the Supporting Information. Raman spectra show intense G (1577 cm–1) and 2D (2700 cm–1) bands characteristic of good-quality
graphene (Figure SI-1 of the Supporting
Information). The ID/IG ratio of 0.3 and the I2D/IG ratio of 0.5 indicate that the flakes
consist of more than five layers of graphene with extended conjugation
of sp2 carbon network. SEM (Figure SI-2) and AFM (Figure SI-3) images
show the average flake size to be 1–2 μm with 5–15
nm thickness. The above procedure for exfoliation without the use
of KMnO4 has shown to produce graphene with very less extent
of oxidation, but rather NO3– and SO42– ions intercalate to give the exfoliated flakes
(Supporting Information of ref (40)). The graphene used in
this work also possess similar characteristics.

The host liquid
crystal used here is the well-known 4-pentyl-4′-cyanobiphenyl
(5CB for short), which was procured from E-Merck. As expected, incorporation
of graphene into the LC material increases the electrical conductivity
of the composite. Since the aim is to perform electrical switching
measurements, the sample conductivity had to be kept reasonably low,
and therefore a minute concentration (0.01 wt % of the total mixture)
of graphene is employed.

Two different kinds of cells have been
used for the measurements,
which we refer to as in situ and template. The cells were made using
indium tin oxide-coated glass plates, the inner surfaces of which
had a thin polymer layer to facilitate planar alignment of the LC
molecules; the cell gap was ∼25 μm. The in situ polymer
network cells without and with graphene are labeled PSLC and PSGLC,
respectively, whereas the template one that contained the network
with graphene is referred to as PSGLC-t. In all of the cases, the
polymer network is obtained using a photoreactive monomer, RM82 (from
E-Merck), along with a photoinitiator BME. RM82 is also a mesogen
in its monomeric form, exhibiting the nematic phase, a feature that
helps in getting a good homogeneous mixture with 5CAB. The molecular
structures and transition temperatures of these materials are given
in Figure SI-4. The RM82 concentration
was kept constant at 3 wt %, and the photoinitiator, 2% of RM82. Photopolymerization
of RM82 was carried out by illuminating the cells filled with the
appropriate material using an intensity-stabilized UV source (Hamamatsu
LS5) in conjunction with a fiber-optic light guide. A 365 nm bandpass
filter and an IR filter were introduced between the light guide and
the cells. The actual power of the UV light received at the cell surface,
measured using a UV power meter (Hamamatsu C6080-03), was 3 mW/cm2. Before filling the cells, weighed amounts of the constituents
were physically mixed at 100 °C and then polymerized at room
temperature. For the PSGLC-t case, after polymerization, the cells
were immersed for 48 h in a beaker containing acetone to remove the
active LC (5CB), graphene not attached to the polymer strands, and
any unreacted monomer (RM82). Subsequently, the solvent was removed
and the cells were dried. Microscopy observation of these cells containing
the templated polymer showed the presence of the network. The cells
were then filled with 5CB, to achieve the PSGLC-t configuration.

2.2 Measurements
Dielectric measurements
were carried out using an LCR meter (Agilent E4890A) capable of providing
an oscillatory voltage up to 20 V. Electro-optical response measurements
were done by placing the sample in a polarizing optical microscope
(Leitz DMRXP). The microscope illumination was used as the light source,
and a photodetector in the beam path, placed after the sample, measured
the transmission through the cell, recorded using a digital oscilloscope
(Agilent DSO5054A). The voltage needed for switching the state of
the LC was provided by a function generator (HP 33120 A) amplifier
(TREK model 50/750) combination. The morphology was examined using
a TESCAN MIRA3 LM (Czech Republic) field emission scanning electron
microscope and Agilent Technologies 5500 AFM. Raman spectra were acquired
using a Horiba Jobin Yvon XploRA confocal Raman microscope with 532
nm laser excitation.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Microscopy
Optical microscopy images
for PSLC and PSGLC cases are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. The images were captured
by maintaining the sample in the isotropic phase and for obtaining
good contrast, no polarizers were employed. Even on a cursory look,
substantial differences are seen between the two images. The PSLC
case shows very coarse and spread out strands, providing an apparent
feeling of increased density (it must be borne in mind that the polymer
content is the same in both the cases). Also, the image could not
be brought to a fine focus, which perhaps suggests a non-negligible
traverse of the polymer strands from the substrate plane. In contrast,
the PSGLC case shows very fine strands, which are sparse; branching
of the bundles is also evident. The spacing between the bundles is
approximately 20 μm. The image in Figure 1a suggests that the spacing in the PSLC case
must be less than 10 μm. The fact that the image for PSGLC could
be sharply focused indicates that the polymer bundles must be essentially
restricted to the substrate plane. The electro-optic characters to
be discussed below appear to be influenced by these features.

Figure 1 Optical microscopy
images of (a) PSLC and (b) PSGLC cells taken
in the isotropic phase without any polarizers, exhibiting substantial
morphological difference owing to the presence of graphene in the
latter case. PSGLC shows thinner fibers and thus has more transparency,
a feature certainly appealing to scattering/transparency devices.

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images are shown in Figure 2a–c for PSLC
and Figure 2d–f
for PSGLC. The morphologies in the two cases are clearly seen to be
quite different: while PSLC has a strong tendency to form polymer
bundles of sizeable thickness (Figure 2b), PSGLC seems to favor thinner fibers (Figure 2e). This leads to, keeping
the same polymer content, larger surface area offered by the polymer
fibers to the neighboring LC regions. Since the entire PSLC concept
is based on the virtual surfaces provided by the polymer fiber, having
a larger number of thinner fibers is certainly advantageous. The second
feature is the focus of the image is not very uniform over the imaging
area even on linear dimensions of 30 μm (Figure 2a,b). In contrast, the focus is always sharp
in the case of PSGLC. This suggests that the out-of-plane traverse
is much less in the case of PSGLC. In addition to the fact that the
PSGLC situation mimics the droplet or swiss-cheese morphology, these
features indicate the much stronger polymer fibers caused by graphene
acting as a nanofiller. It is common knowledge that the different
carbonaceous forms when nanofillers are used in polymeric materials
result in significant mechanical strengthening of the polymer.42 Having recently observed similar features in
another case, wherein the polymer strands were reinforced by carbon
nanotubes, we suggest that incorporation of rigid nanostructures into
the polymer matrix yields thinner but stronger polymer bundles, which
enhance the virtual surface effect for PSLC applications. To obtain
an unequivocal evidence for the presence of graphene in the polymer
matrix we carried out Raman spectroscopy measurements on PSGLC and
PSLC cells. The results, which are described in the next section,
were carried out the same way as for the SEM analysis, by washing
out the LC and opening the cells.

Figure 2 SEM images of the PSLC (a–c) and
PSGLC (d–f) after
removing the contained host liquid crystal and also removing the top
plate from the cell. The morphological differences between the two
cases are more evident in (b) and (e).

3.2 Raman Spectroscopy
To visualize the
presence of graphene in the polymer matrix, we have obtained Raman
mapping of macroscopic areas (80 μm × 80 μm) of PSGLC.
The contour maps of the G band are given in Figure 3a, and those for the D and G′ bands
are given in Figure SI-5 of the Supporting
Information. While the graphene-rich regions have higher intensity
(green), the entire polymer region has low intensity (blue). The exemplary
Raman spectra over a larger wavenumber range are given in Figure 3b for the PSLC sample
as well as at different spatial positions of the PSGLC film. The latter
sample exhibits the signatures of the graphene flakes corresponding
to D (1354 cm–1), G (1581 cm–1), and 2D (2705 cm–1) bands, indicating the presence
of graphene in PSGLC films. It is noted that for the PSGLC, the G
band position is shifted by 4 cm–1 in comparison
to that for pristine graphene (Figure SI-2), arguably due to charge-transfer interaction between graphene and
the soft materials, viz. RM82 and 5CB. The profile for PSLC, which
lacks the graphene content, is contrastingly different from that of
PSGLC. The D, G, and 2D bands are naturally missing in this case.
We identify the most prominent peak seen at 1600 cm–1 carbon–carbon bond stretching of aromatic rings contained
in RM82. A family of Raman profiles covering a traverse of 80 μm
in the plane of the film is shown in Figure SI-6. Again the graphene-rich and graphene-poor regions stand out clearly.

Figure 3 (A) Raman
mapping of a polymer fiber region from the PSGLC cell
at the wavenumber 1581 cm–1 corresponding to the
G band of graphene. In this iso-intensity contour plot, the intense
regions (green) are from the graphene-rich areas, whereas the low-intensity
(blue) regions are from polymer-rich areas. (B) Sections of the Raman
map in (A) depicted as “one-dimensional” Raman spectra
of the PSLC (scan d) and PSGLC (scans a–c) systems. Scans (a)
and (b) indicate polymer-dominant and graphene-dominant areas of the
PSGLC film, whereas the scan (c) is from a region that contains both
materials. For the scan (a), the peaks identified as 1 and 2 are from
the C–C stretching in the biphenyl and phenyl moieties, respectively,
as in fact found for PSLC (scan d). In (b), peaks 1–3 correspond
to the D, G, and G′ bands of graphene, respectively. The inset
shows that if the data are normalized with respect to the G′
band intensity, then the sets (b) and (c) are essentially identical.

In view of the information from
microscopy and Raman measurements,
we propose that the graphene-incorporated polymer network would be
like a “loofah” network with the graphene flakes decorating
the surface of the fibers in spatially random way, a scenario that
is illustrated schematically in Figure 4. The graphene decoration is highlighted in the inset
of the illustration, a feature that is more realistic in the case
of the template PSLC, a situation that will be discussed later.

Figure 4 Schematic diagram
illustrating the dispersion of the liquid crystalline
molecules (green ellipses) in a polymer network (gray lines) strengthened
by the presence of graphene flakes, which are proposed to be decorating
the walls of the polymer fibers (especially in the template PSLC situation),
as shown for an isolated fiber depicted in the blown-up inset.

3.3 Permittivity
Temperature-dependent
permittivity measurements were carried out at a fixed frequency of
10 kHz with two different magnitudes of the alternating current field:
0.1 and 20 V. While the former, which is well below the Freedericksz
threshold voltage (Vth), gives ε⊥, the latter being much larger than Vth yields ε∥. There is a slight
reduction (increase) in ε∥ (ε⊥) for PSGLC in comparison to those for the PSLC material (Figure 5). Concomitantly,
the anisotropy εa (=ε∥ –
ε⊥) also has a decrease (by ∼16% at
room temperature) for the graphene composite. This could be suggesting
a little lowering of the order parameter for PSGLC or a slightly enhanced
antiparallel correlation between the neighboring LC molecules, a feature
known to be strongly favored in alkyl cyanobiphenyls, such as the
presently used LC. Since TNI, the isotropic–nematic
transition temperature, is hardly altered by the addition of graphene
(PSGLC), we may ignore the former cause. However, ε∥ and permittivity in the isotropic are lower than those for the PSLC
system. Thus, we argue that the enhancement of the antiparallel correlation
between the 5CB molecules is primarily responsible for the observed
dielectric features.

Figure 5 Temperature dependence of permittivity ε in the
isotropic
and nematic phases parallel (∥) and perpendicular (⊥)
to the director for PSLC and PSGLC cells. The feature that the dielectric
anisotropy, given by the difference in the ∥ and ⊥ values,
as well as the permittivity in the isotropic are reduced for the PSGLC
case is attributed to a better antiparallel correlation between the
liquid crystal molecules.

3.4 Electrical Switching
The positive
dielectric anisotropy of the system couples to the applied electric
field in a quadratic fashion. If the field is applied normal to the
director, then a positive torque ∝ εaE2 acts on the molecules and sets up a competition
between the surface (elastic) forces trying to retain the equilibrium
situation and the electric field demanding reorientation. At a certain
threshold voltage (Vth), the latter wins
and the reorientation of the director gets initiated. For V ≫ Vth, the reorientation
gets completed with the molecules becoming parallel to the electric
field. Concomitantly, significant birefringence changes take place
with the equilibrium situation (planar) giving the largest contribution,
and the field-driven case (homeotropic), the least (ideally zero).
This phenomenon is referred to as the Freedericksz transformation,
and lies at the heart of a variety of electrically driven LC device
principles. The director reorientation can be probed response functions
such as optical transmission, sample capacitance, etc. Figure 6 shows the Freedericksz transformation
behavior for PSLC and PSGLC systems presenting the variation of sample
capacitance (C) as a function of the applied voltage;
for better illustration, the data are shown normalized using Cnorm = (C – C⊥)/(C∥ – C⊥), with C⊥ being the equilibrium capacitance value obtained
in the planar orientation of the LC molecules. The PSLC sample actually
shows two-stepped variation; however, we take the threshold to be
the voltage at which the larger change in capacitance gets initiated.
The PSGLC sample exhibits a dramatic lowering of Vth in comparison to the mixture without graphene (PSLC);
the value decreases by nearly an order of magnitude (in PSLC, the
threshold for even the smaller first step is higher than that for
PSGLC). It is interesting to note that while the Vth for PSLC is much higher than for 5CB (the pure LC),
the confinement in the PSGLC matrix reduces it even below that of
the pure LC (see Table 1). Thus, the graphene-reinforced matrix provides the double benefit
of mechanical rigidity combined with lowered threshold voltage. Besides,
above Vth, the rise in capacitance is
much sharper for the PSGLC sample (see inset of Figure 6). Since the associated slope is inversely
proportional to the bend elastic constant, the observed behavior is
quite attractive for achieving higher resolution in gray scale capabilities
of a display device. This slope given by the ratio dC/dV is a factor of 4 higher for the PSGLC mixture
(0.12 ± 0.002) than its nongraphene counterpart (0.031 ±
0.001). In addition to PSGLC, the composite with 0.01% concentration
of graphene, three more compositions PSGLC0.005, PSGLC0.0085, and PSGLC0.1, with 0.005, 0.0085, and 0.1%
graphene, respectively, were investigated for their Freedericksz behavior.
All of these composites have a Vth higher
than for PSGLC. As seen from Table 1, the graphene composition dependence of Vth appears to be nonmonotonic, showing a minimum for PSGLC.
Experiments with a higher loading of graphene could not be performed
owing to the high electrical conductivity of the samples (the conductivity
values obtained at room temperature for the planar aligned sample
are shown for a few materials in Table S2). It is important to note that higher concentrations could have,
in fact, led to increase in the magnitude of the threshold voltage
as has been observed in general for polymer-stabilized systems (see,
e.g., ref (43)). It
may, however, be pointed out that a previous study of ours44 did indeed point to this possibility that very
low concentrations of the additive can result in an improvement of
the properties. Inclusion of nanoparticles, such as ZnO,45 Gold,46 ZnS/Mn47 Sb2O5,48 and clay,49 has been seen to
lower Vth. However, the extent of improvement
seen in the present studies with very small concentrations of graphene
is unprecedented.

Figure 6 Electric field-driven Freederickz transformation represented
in
terms of capacitance–voltage profiles for PSLC and PSGLC systems;
for the sake of presentation, the data are normalized using Cnorm = (C – C⊥)/(C∥ – C⊥). The significant
reduction in the threshold voltage (Vth, the knee point in the profiles) for PSGLC case is evident. The
inset shows the profiles over an extended voltage region and brings
out the features of sharper response above the threshold and attainment
of saturation at lower voltages for PSGLC.

One of the primary results of this work is displayed
in Figure 7 comparing
the temperature
dependence of Vth for PSLC and PSGLC.
The behaviors are drastically different: While PSLC has the usual
nonlinear variation with a strong rise in the vicinity of the isotropic
phase and a limiting situation at lower temperatures, PSGLC has zero
dependence on temperature. Thus, for the PSGLC system, the threshold
voltage is not only substantially lower, but also remains invariant
with temperature and features very attractive from the viewpoint of
designing the display driving circuits,43 owing to the nonrequirement of correcting for the ambient temperature
variation of Vth. In fact, we have recently
reported39 similar results in another PSLC
system, wherein the network was strengthened by the incorporation
polymer-decorated carbon nanotubes. However, the reduction in Vth between the non-CNT and CNT systems was only
about 20%, in contrast to a factor of 7 diminution seen in the current
studies for the graphene-incorporated system. In fact, such a large
reduction in Vth is unprecedented in the
PSLC/PDLC systems, wherein nanostructures of various kinds have been
incorporated,46,50−56 especially so considering that the concentration of the graphene
employed here is extremely small (0.01%). The fact that the lowered Vth and its thermal invariance have been achieved
without any special functionality imposed on the nanostructure (graphene)
is attractive and suggests that there is a huge potential for generalization
of the methodology, which allows for various nanostructures to be
incorporated for strengthening the polymer fibers. It is interesting
that graphene, vis-à-vis decorated CNT, as a very-low-concentration
filler has been able to achieve a much larger diminution in Vth. This could be owing to better affinity of
graphene to the polymer surface, a fact that is evident from the morphology
seen in the SEM images, as well as the results of the template technique
to be described below. This invariance in temperature could be arising
owing to effective manipulation of the anchoring strength by graphene
getting adhered to the polymer surface at the time of the photoconversion
of the monomer to a polymer fiber. We now elaborate on the role played
by the altered anchoring strength. The influence of the surface on
the elastic behavior of the nematic liquid crystal can be described
in terms of the anchoring strength of the surface. Of course, unlike
in non-network systems, the PSLC architecture can be thought of to
provide virtual surfaces at every interface between the polymer and
the liquid crystal, and thus over the entire bulk of the sample and
not merely at the two substrate surfaces. Following Seo et al.,57 we consider the anchoring strength to be given
by the ratio of K11, the splay elastic
constant, to the surface extrapolation length le. In the polymer–LC interfacial region, le has two contributions: le1 from the order parameter variation and le2 from the direct interaction of the LC molecules with the surface.
For PSLC, the contribution is dominated by le1, whereas for PSGLC with its mechanically stronger surface, le2 dominates. This causes the anchoring energy
and consequently threshold voltage to become temperature-invariant,
supporting the experimental observations.

Figure 7 Thermal variation of
the threshold voltage for the PSLC and PSGLC
cases exhibiting strikingly different behaviors, while PSLC shows
the standard variation; the temperature-independent value seems for
PSGLC quite attractive.

3.5 Electro-Optical Switching
The dynamics
associated with the reorientation from planar to homeotropic and back
is shown in Figure 8. The responses are obtained by collecting, with the help of a photodiode
and an associated differential amplifier, the intensity of a light
beam transmitted through the sample kept between crossed polarizers.
The field-on response was recorded on applying a sinusoidal voltage
of 20 Vrms and at 1 kHz, while the field-off response was
obtained after switching the applied field off. Both the field-on
(τON) and field-off (τOFF) responses,
defined as the duration for the output to change between 10 and 90%
of the total, are comparable between the two systems, with τON and τON being 20 and 120 ms, respectively.
However, the backflow feature, an undesirable effect seen in the PSLC
system, is absent for PSGLC.

Figure 8 Dynamics of the electro-optical switching for
PSLC and PSGLC presenting
the (a) field-on and (b) field-off responses. The response times tau-on
and tau-off for the two processes appear to be impervious to the presence
of graphene. However, in the PSGLC system, the undesirable backflow
effect is eliminated.

3.6 Device
A device based on these features
and operating between the field-off scattering and field-on transparent
states is presented in Figure 9. While the conventional PSLC device (panels (a) and (b))
has a good transparent condition, wherein the printed text placed
behind the device is very clearly visible, its scattering state suffers
from light leakage. The PSGLC device (panels (c) and (d)), on the
other hand, has excellent characteristics with hardly any light leakage.
This could be due to two reasons: (i) the well-defined polymer morphology
aided by the presence of graphene and (ii) light absorption by graphene,
as can be visually seen in the device. The attractive part is that
the contrast ratio, given by the light level transmitted in the field-on
to field-off states, gets doubled for the graphene-incorporated device,
with the contrast ratios being 53 and 25 for the PSGLC and PSLC systems,
respectively.

Figure 9 Visual performance of the devices having (a) PSLC and
(b) PSGLC
architectures. The devices exhibit a field-off scattering state switching
to a transparent one upon application of voltage. The blocking of
the background text is better in the PSGLC case, leading to a much
better contrast for the device, given by the ratio of the light transmission
in the field-on to the field-off situation.

3.7 Polymer–Template System
In
a further development in having carbon-reinforced PSLC devices, we
now demonstrated that a new strategy in terms of templated architecture
can be realized by the studied system. As is expected for template
systems, such a realization holds the potential of the option to employ
different host systems, optimized for the chemical nature, magnitude
of the physical parameters, etc. For this purpose, we employ a wash
and refill technique to build templated systems. The protocol is shown
in the block diagram depicted in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Block diagram showing the steps involved in
the fabrication of
the templated PSGLC (PSGLC-t).

Briefly, after the PSGLC is formed, the device was immersed
in
acetone for 48 h to wash out the host LC, any unpolymerized RM82,
and graphene flakes, which are not contained inside the polymer network.
The cell was left for drying over extended periods of time (∼48
h) for the solvent to be completely removed. Observation of the cell
under polarizing optical microscopy showed the complete absence of
the LC in the cell. We refer to the cell as PSGLC-t. Subsequently,
the cell was refilled with the host LC (without any graphene content)
and then the Freederickz transformation measurements were conducted. Figure 11 shows the comparative C–V profiles for PSLC, PSGLC, and
PSGLC-t cells. As seen in Table 1, Vth slightly increases
for the templated system, but is certainly much lower than the PSLC
device. The marginal difference could be due to any possible effect
of the solvent on the surfaces of the polymer network. This clearly
demonstrates the robustness of the PSGLC network and provides a path
to use this architecture as a template for a variety of LC devices.

Figure 11 Freederickz
transformation profiles for the PSLC, PSGLC, and PSGLC-t
situations. PSGLC-t is obtained by washing the liquid crystal off
after the formation of the network in the PSGLC case subsequently
refilling it with the host LC. Although this case shows a slightly
increase in Vth compared to that for PSGLC,
the value is still much lower than the non-graphene-containing PSLC.
For the sake of presentation, the vertical axis is given in terms
of Cnorm = (C – C⊥)/(C∥ – C⊥).

4 Conclusions
We have
delineated an attractive strategy to create a novel type
of polymer-stabilized liquid crystal by incorporating small amounts
of graphene. Even at these trace levels, the presence of graphene
has significant effects on the virtual surfaces of the polymer network,
as evident from (a) distinctly different morphologies as imaged by
scanning electron microscopy and (b) desirable improvements to the
PSLC device characteristics. The most notable is the influence on
the critical voltage for device operation: In addition to the value
decreasing by a factor of 7, the parameter itself becomes independent
of temperature. From the point of view of designing the driver circuitry,
this is especially advantageous. The device which displays field-off
scattering and field-on transparent states shows an enhanced contrast
ratio upon inclusion of graphene. The expected increase in mechanical
strength, owing to the presence of the carbon form in the polymer
network, has the potential to realize substrate-free flexible devices.
In this regard, the presence of graphene would certainly enhance the
mechanical rigidity of the system, while still maintaining the operating
voltages low. This double benefit in the described simple system,
contrasts with far more complicated situations reported recently.38 The strengthening of the polymer strands, which
is the feature behind the large reduction in the threshold voltage
and its temperature independence, was achieved in the previous case39 using a nanostructure (CNT), which was specially
designed for the purpose and made to have an outer shell to match
chemically the host polymer. The present study has shown that with
graphene the need for chemical modification of the nanostructure is
altogether obviated. We have further confirmed this feature by creating
a template structure, wherein any unattached graphene is leeched out.
These features are well supported by Raman mapping of the ensuing
structures. Hence, the method paves way for better devices without
appealing to tedious chemical methods. Even quantitatively, the current
report stands out because the magnitude of reduction in the threshold
voltage is an unprecedented factor of 7. Importantly, the studies
emphasize the importance of nanofillers at very low concentrations
to the device operating characteristics and thus have the potential
to be generalized to a variety of situations.
