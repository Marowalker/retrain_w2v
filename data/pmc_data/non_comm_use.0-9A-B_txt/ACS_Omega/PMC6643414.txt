This work discloses the first ever magnetically retrievable copper isophthalate-based metal-organic
framework (MOF) decorated with surface-modified cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles that have been utilized as catalytic
reactors for obtaining a relatively large number of biologically active
benzimidazole scaffolds. A facile one-pot solvothermal approach was
employed for obtaining spherical and monodisperse CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, which were subsequently modified using
suitable protecting and functionalizing agents. Finally, these functionalized
magnetic nanoparticles were anchored onto the three-dimensional copper
isophthalate MOF via a covalent immobilization methodology. The exploitation
of advanced microscopic tools such as transmission electron microscopy
and scanning electron microscopy provided valuable insights into the
morphology of the immobilized MOF. These results indicated that the
surface-modified magnetic nanoparticles had grown onto the surface
of copper-5-nitroisophthalic acid MOF. A greener C–H functionalization
strategy that involves the multicomponent oxidative cross-coupling
between two different set of amines (sp2-hybridized nitrogen-containing
anilines and sp3-hybridized nitrogen-containing alkyl/aryl
amine derivatives) and sodium azide has been incorporated to provide
access to a broad spectrum of the value-added target benzimidazole
moieties. It is interesting to note that this magnetic MOF-catalyzed
protocol not only replaces toxic solvents with water, which is a green
solvent, but also enhances the economic competitiveness since the
magnetic catalyst can be readily recovered and recycled for eight
consecutive runs.

1 Introduction
Recent
years have witnessed a paradigm shift toward green and sustainable
organic synthesis. This shift has become even more apparent in the
face of growing environmental and economic concerns. It is interesting
to note that transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions,
which lie at the heart of modern innovative science, have experienced
a potential economic boom with the advent of C–H activation
strategies.1−13 Introduced by Bergman and co-workers, the C–H activation
reactions have gained a paramount importance in the field of synthetic
organic chemistry, as they present a major step toward advancing the
goals of green chemistry. In this regard, the recent attempts to synthesize
C–N bond-containing heterocyclic motifs such as benzimidazoles
using an oxidative C–H functionalization strategy are worth
applauding.14−16 Benzimidazole scaffolds are known to show exceptional
biological properties that have been exploited successfully in the
development of a large number of therapeutic, life-saving drugs such
as Nexium, Attacand, Protonix, Prilosec, and Famvir.17−20 It is the exceptional pharmacological profile of benzimidazole motifs
that have stimulated various research groups to explore novel methodologies
for the synthesis of these molecules. Among all of the enlisted strategies,
C–H activation strategy using multicomponent reaction partners
stands apart as it readily overcomes the inherent drawbacks associated
with the conventional approaches.21 However,
the utilization of transition-metal salts as catalysts in such cases
renders their commercial applicability rather desolate because of
the difficulty in separation and recovery of these homogeneous active
metal salts. Therefore, the escalation toward the synthesis of an
efficient heterogeneous catalyst, which can lead to the generation
of desired benzimidazole pharmacophores, is of prime importance.

Currently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), an incipient class
of porous crystalline materials, have garnered the attention of both
academic and industrial researchers for developing heterogeneous catalytic
systems.22−28 The persistent catalytic engrossment of MOFs relies on their exceptional
properties, including intrinsic high metal content, well-characterized
and tunable crystal structures and composition, multidirectional bonding
capability, plentiful metal geometries, and good catalytic selectivity,
due to atomically precise active sites that render them appealing
for use in catalysis.29−33 Besides, the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites inside MOFs
possess an inherent ability to tune the interactions between the reactants
and the MOF.34 Perceiving the scientific
and industrial impact of these environmentally benign, structurally
versatile materials, MOFs having robust backbone structures and high
metal-binding sites, in which the structural nodes themselves act
as the catalytic centers, have recently been investigated as solid
catalysts for catalyzing a wide variety of reactions.35−37 Also, to enhance the separation properties of the MOFs, the idea
of magnetic recoverability has been employed and thus, to date, a
few magnetically retrievable MOFs have been reported.38−45

1.1 Motivation and Strategy
Considering
the quest for developing a sustainable heterogeneous catalyst for
the oxidative cross-coupling reaction that can provide a ready access
to targeted pharmacological benzimidazoles moieties, and also in conjunction
with our ongoing research work in the design and development of magnetic
silica-based nanomaterials,46−53 we report novel CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)-based MOF as catalyst for the synthesis of exceedingly
biologically significant benzimidazoles. Covalent bonding approach
is exploited to fabricate MOFs decorated with magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs), which besides enriching the developed material with immense
chemical stability, prudent durability, and higher reproducibility,
also impart imperishable magnetism.54−58 This protocol replaces toxic solvents with environmentally
benign water, which adds to the green credentials. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first report wherein a heterogeneous catalyst
has been effectively employed on multicomponent oxidative coupling
for the synthesis of benzimidazoles (Scheme 1).

Azide
2 Results
and Discussion
The final catalyst has been prepared by a
step-by-step assembly
process through the successive surface modifications of cobalt ferrite
nanoparticles, as shown in Scheme 2. Preparation of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles is the
first step toward the accomplishment of the synthesis of catalyst.
Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized via solvothermal technique.59 Ethylene glycol plays an important role in the
formation of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles. Ethylene glycol, having
relatively high boiling point, is a strong reducing agent and has
been widely used for the synthesis of monodisperse metal or metal
oxide nanoparticles.60 Magnetic spinel
ferrite particles have a strong tendency to undergo agglomeration
during their formation in the solution-phase process. Sodium acetate
was added for electrostatic stabilization, while poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) was added as a surfactant. Thereafter, the modified sol–gel
approach was utilized for the silica encapsulation of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.61 Subsequently,
the amine functionalities were introduced onto the surface of silica-encapsulated
cobalt ferrite nanoparticles using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES).62 Then, a covalent bonding approach was utilized
to introduce the synthesized CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2 onto the copper MOF, which ultimately resulted
in the formation of a hybrid magnetic MOF denoted as CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA).

Illustration for the Synthesis of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)
Besides, the structure of developed catalyst was affirmed
systematically
using different characterization tools such as Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS), Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF),
and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

2.1 Catalyst Characterizations
2.1.1 FT-IR
Spectroscopy
FT-IR spectra
of CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4@SiO2, CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2, and CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) were recorded in the range of 4000–400 cm–1, as shown in Figure 1. The spectrum of CoFe2O4 clearly
depicts absorption bands centered at around 874 and 592 cm–1, which are assigned to the Co–O and Fe–O vibrations,
while broad bands at around 3420 and 1640 cm–1 are
accredited to the stretching and bending vibrations of the surface
OH groups. Moreover, appearance of bands at 798, 956, and 1093 cm–1 in the spectra of silica-coated cobalt ferrite corresponds
to the Si–O–Si symmetric, Si–O symmetric, and
Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching modes, which confirms
the presence of silica in CoFe2O4@SiO2.63 On moving to APTES-functionalized
CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles, two new
bands observed at 2920 and 1628 cm–1 are attributed
to the CH2 and NH2 groups of the amino-propyl
moiety, respectively, which subsequently confirms the surface functionalization
of CoFe2O4@SiO2. The comparison of
the FT-IR spectra between CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2 and CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) confirms that the structure of MOF has
been successfully decorated/chemically bonded with amine-functionalized
silica-coated cobalt ferrite nanoparticles. In the final spectra of
CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA),
bands appearing at around 1624, 1356, 1085, 928, and 784 cm–1 are assigned to that of the organic ligand (5-nitroisophthalic acid
(5-NIPA)). Further, a new weak signal in the spectra of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) at 1532 cm–1 indicates amide bond formation due to the chemical
reaction between the carboxylic groups of (5-NIPA) and exposed NH2 groups of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2.64−67

2.1.2 XRD Analysis
The structural integrity
of the obtained materials was studied using powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) technique. To deeply understand the crystalline phase structure
of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA),
XRD patterns of CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4@SiO2, and CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) were recorded (Figure 2). The characteristic Bragg
diffraction peaks observed at 30.4, 35.7, 43.3, 53.3, 57.3, and 62.9°
can be orderly assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511),
and (440) planes of spinel CoFe2O4. These observation
data match well with the standard XRD data of Joint Committee on Powder
Diffraction Standards card number (22-1086). Additionally, the Bragg
peaks in CoFe2O4@SiO2 spectra are
obtained at the same 2θ values as CoFe2O4, which confirms that the structure of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles
remains intact even after silica coating. In the XRD spectrum of hybrid
magnetic CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA), peaks observed at 2θ values of (8.5), (9.8), (15.75),
and (25.98) are assigned to that of crystalline Cu(5-NIPA). Besides,
the spectrum also possesses peaks corresponding to spinel cobalt ferrite
nanoparticles, which further indicates the decoration of MOF with
CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2.

2.1.3 TEM and SEM Analyses
TEM images
clearly reveal the monodisperse and spherical structure of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 200
nm (Figure 3). The
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) presented the polycrystalline
nature of the synthesized nanoparticles and also revealed the appearance
of white spotty diffraction rings, which are indexed to [220], [311],
[400], [422], and [511] planes of CoFe2O4. Furthermore,
the TEM image of CoFe2O4@SiO2 corroborates
the presence of a uniform layer of silica of approximately 19 nm around
the magnetic core, which further prevents agglomeration. SEM analysis
also clearly depicts the monodisperse nature of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles.
A close insight into the captured images unveils that the synthesized
copper-5-nitroisophthalic acid-based MOF exhibits bipyramidal hexagonal
prismlike structure. The SEM images of Cu(5-NIPA) and hybrid magnetic
CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)
clearly disclose that the surface of Cu(5-NIPA) has been decorated
by amine-functionalized cobalt ferrite nanoparticles.

image of hybrid magnetic CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA).

2.1.4 Physicochemical Characterizations
Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectroscopy along with elemental mapping
and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectroscopy were
conducted to accomplish the elemental analysis of the obtained catalyst.
EDS elemental mapping images (Figure S1, Supporting Information) of the hybrid magnetic CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) clearly reveal
the uniform distribution of all of the elements, i.e., Fe, Co, Cu,
C, N, Si, and O in the MOF. The EDS spectrum of CoFe2O4@SiO2 shows well-defined peaks of cobalt, iron,
oxygen, and silicon, which substantiates the presence of amorphous
silica layer around the magnetic (CoFe2O4) core
(Figure S2). The presence of Cu, N, Co,
Fe, O, Si, and C, elements in the spectra of final catalyst further
corroborates the decoration of amine-functionalized cobalt ferrite
nanoparticles onto MOF. Further, a well-resolved peak of copper in
the ED-XRF spectrum of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) also supports the covalent anchoring process.
Moreover, ICP-MS technique is used to quantify the amount of copper
in the obtained catalyst, which was found to be 0.1286 mmol/g.

2.1.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis
TGA
was recorded to gain an insight into the stability of the synthesized
hybrid magnetic MOF (Figure 4). The thermogram curve of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) shows two different regions. A
weight loss of around 13% in the first region (i.e., between 40 and
125 °C) is ascribed to the loss of guest and coordinated water
molecules from the MOF. Moreover, observation by this analysis elucidates
that the complete decomposition of the CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) structure is observed
at 330 °C, i.e., in the second region.

(TGA) curve of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA).

2.1.6 VSM Analysis
The magnetic characteristics
of CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4@SiO2, CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2, and CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) were investigated using the vibrating sample magnetometer
technique (Figure 5). The magnetic hysteresis measurements of the synthesized catalyst
were carried out at room temperature (r.t.) in external field sweeping
between −10 000 and 10 000 Oe. The magnetic hysteresis
curves of CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4@SiO2, CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2, and CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) reveal the superparamagnetic nature of obtained
nanoparticles, which is also signified by the absence of hysteresis
phenomenon and coercivity. The specific saturation magnetization (Ms) values of bare CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, CoFe2O4@SiO2, CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2, final catalyst
are found to be 64, 49, 43, and 22 emu/g, respectively. It can be
seen that the curve exhibits decrease in the values of saturation
magnetization as the surface of bare magnetic nanoparticles is modified
using various protecting, functionalizing, and linking agents. This
decrease in the net magnetism is observed due to the reduction in
the surface moments of individual particles. However, regardless of
the lowering of Ms values, it is still
considerable and sufficient to collect hybrid MNPs from solution under
the influence of external magnetic field.

2.2 Activity
of Synthesized Catalyst in the Oxidative
Cross-Coupling of Substituted Aniline, 1° Aryl/Alkyl Amine and
Sodium Azide To Yield Benzimidazoles via C–H Functionalization
Strategy
The catalytic potency of the newly synthesized hybrid
core–shell magnetic MOF-based copper catalyst was evaluated
in the synthesis of benzimidazoles via C–H functionalization
strategy by choosing aniline and benzylamine as model substrates.
To achieve the optimum reaction conditions, influence of various kinetic
and thermodynamic criterions such as amount of catalyst, solvent,
reaction time, temperature, and type of oxidant and its concentration
were studied accurately for the oxidative cross-coupling reaction
in the presence of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) catalyst.

2.3 Catalytic
Evaluation
A control experiment
using 1:1.2 molar ratios of test substrates (i.e., 1 mmol aniline
and 1.2 mmol benzylamine) was first conducted in the absence of catalyst.
It was concluded that the reaction failed to occur under such conditions,
which necessitates the presence of catalyst to afford the desired
benzimidazole product. Various metal-based sources and heterogeneous
catalysts were then employed to achieve the target product by cross-coupling
between aniline, benzylamine moieties, and sodium azide using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an oxidant (Table S1, Supporting Information). A detailed
analysis of the observed results revealed that the newly synthesized
copper-MOF-based heterogeneous catalyst resulted in the highest conversion
percentage, which further signifies the efficacy of MOF-based copper
catalyst in the oxidative cross-coupling reaction.

2.3.1 Amount
of Catalyst
Model reactions
were carried out to investigate the effect of variation in the amount
of catalyst for the cross-coupling reaction using CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) catalyst
and TBHP as an oxidant. The amount of catalyst was varied from 5 to
30 mg. A 44% conversion was observed when 5 mg of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) catalyst
was employed (Figure 6). A remarkable increase in the conversion percentage was observed
on increasing the amount of catalyst to 25 mg by virtue of increase
in the number of active catalytic sites. Further, it was observed
that the conversion percentage remained same on increasing the amount
of catalyst beyond 25 mg, owing to the exhaustion of all active sites
present on the surface of the catalyst. Therefore, the optimized amount
of catalyst which resulted in maximum conversion was fixed to be 25
mg or 0.32 mol % for further experiments.

Figure 6 Effect of the amount
of catalyst on the oxidative cross-coupling
of aniline, benzylamine, and sodium azide [reaction conditions: aniline
(1 mmol), benzylamine (1.2 mmol), sodium azide (3 mmol), CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) catalyst
(x mg/y mol %), acetic acid (5 mmol),
TBHP (3 mmol) in water (1 mL), 70 °C, 10 h].

2.3.2 Effect of Various Solvents
Nature
of solvent plays a very crucial role in transforming the course of
an organic reaction. To achieve the best catalytic conditions, diverse
range of solvents such as acetonitrile, ethanol, dimethylformamide,
water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and toluene were screened for the
CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)-catalyzed
cross-coupling reaction (Figure 7). The reaction was also carried out under solvent-free
conditions, which failed to occur. A self-analysis of the obtained
results implies that highest conversion percentage was obtained when
water was employed as the solvent. Therefore, further catalytic studies
were carried out using water as the solvent.

Figure 7 Effect of solvents on
the oxidative cross-coupling of aniline,
benzylamine, and sodium azide [reaction conditions: aniline (1 mmol),
benzylamine (1.2 mmol), sodium azide (3 mmol), CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) (25 mg/0.32 mol
%), acetic acid (5 mmol), TBHP (3 mmol) in solvent (1 mL), 70 °C,
10 h].

2.3.3 Effect
of Different Oxidants
The
oxidizing capabilities of various oxidants such as H2O2, TBHP, di-tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB), and O2 balloon were explored
in the synthesis of benzimidazole motifs via oxidative cross-coupling
reaction. The accomplishment of the reaction relies highly on the
performance of the employed oxidants. For this purpose, a wide range
of oxidants were evaluated in the synthesis of benzimidazoles (Table S2, Supporting Information). The use of
oxygen balloon and TBPB resulted in trace amounts of benzimidazoles.
It was observed that TBHP was found to be the best oxidizing agent
for this particular reaction due to higher conversion percentage.

2.3.4 Effect of Oxidant Concentration
The concentration
of TBHP also significantly affects the conversion
percentage of product and it was studied by varying its equivalents
from 1 to 5 (Figure 8). It was observed that the conversion percentage increases on increasing
the amount of TBHP from 1 to 3 mmol, i.e., from 36 to 100%. Further,
an increase in the amount of TBHP led to decrease in conversion percentage
because of the enhancement in the side reactions due to large concentration
of oxidant. Thus, the amount of oxidant concentration was fixed to
3 equiv for the rest of the experiments.

Figure 8 Effect of oxidant concentration
on the oxidative cross-coupling
of aniline, benzylamine, and sodium azide [reaction conditions: aniline
(1 mmol), benzylamine (1.2 mmol), sodium azide (3 mmol), CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) (25
mg/0.32 mol %), acetic acid (5 mmol), TBHP (x mmol)
in water (1 mL), 70 °C, 10 h].

2.3.5 Effect of Time and Temperature
It was observed that the reaction time and temperature play a pivotal
role in enhancing the reaction kinetics. To analyze the effect of
these two parameters, model reaction was performed in a distinct range
of temperature (40–70 °C) for discrete time periods (Figure 9). Detailed examination
of the results displayed that the increase in the reaction temperature
leads to linear enhancement in the conversion percentage. Moreover,
conversion percentage was found to be increasing on increasing the
time from 2 to 10 h. Maximum conversion percentage was obtained at
70 °C when the reaction was continued for 10 h. The optimum temperature
and time for the coupling reaction were found to be 70 °C and
10 h, respectively.

(25 mg/0.32 mol %), acetic acid (5 mmol), TBHP (3 mmol) in water (1
mL)].

2.3.6 Substrate
Scope
To explore the
scope and versatility of this methodology, a series of substituted
anilines and primary alkyl/aryl amines were coupled under the established
optimal reaction conditions (Table 1). The results indicated that alkyl amines possessing
electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups were efficiently
converted into the desired benzimidazole product with high conversion
percentage. In general, the protocol exhibited interesting results
and the desired benzimidazoles were obtained with high turnover numbers.
Further, the protocol was also extended for the heterocyclic substrate
such as furfurylamine, which furnished good result. In addition, aliphatic
primary amines such as butylamine and 3-phenyl propanamine also underwent
reaction. Next, the scope of aniline functionalities was also evaluated
for the oxidative coupling protocol. The most distinguishing characteristics
of this methodology were high conversion percentage, reaction devoid
of unwanted side products, wide substrate applicability, extensive
functional group tolerance, and magnetic retrievability.

2.3.7 Mechanistic
Pathway
A plausible
reaction mechanism has been proposed for the CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)-catalyzed multicomponent
oxidative cross-coupling reaction, as outlined in Scheme 3.14 The first step involves the oxidation of benzylamine (A) in the
presence of TBHP to form imine (B), which further undergoes protonation
to form (C). The attack of aryl amine (aniline) on (C) generates complex
(D), which then undergoes intramolecular proton exchange to form (E).
Loss of ammonia molecule from complex (E) resulted in (F). Complex
(F) subsequently undergoes deprotonation to form (G). Copper-based
MOF then coordinates with the nitrogen atom of (G) and forms complex
(H). This complex (H) on treatment with sodium azide in the presence
of acetic acid (acetic acid is added to generate HN3 from
sodium azide) combines with TBHP to form N3 radical, which
then subsequently coordinates with copper(MOF) to form (I). A single
electron transfer (SET) occurs from the aryl ring to the copper metal
to generate complex (J), which subsequently transforms into (K) via
the transfer of the azido group from copper center to the ortho position
of the aryl ring. Complex (K) then undergoes single electron-transfer
process to form complex (L), which then generates (M) with the elimination
of nitrogen on heating. This complex (M) undergoes intramolecular
oxidative cyclization to form (N), which then aromatizes to form the
desired product (O), i.e., benzimidazole, while the catalyst is regenerated.

by CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)
2.4 Heterogeneity
Test
Leaching of active
metal species from solid support is confronted during catalytic reaction,
which is one of the persistent problems in the case of heterogenized
homogeneous catalysts. To eliminate the contribution of any homogeneous
catalytic species in catalyzed reaction, a standard hot filtration
test was performed with model substrates. Although it is a well-known
fact that metal-organic frameworks are heterogeneous in nature, just
to check the inherent stability of hybrid core–shell magnetic
metal-organic framework, catalyst was removed from reaction mixture,
when the reaction has been continued for about half the reaction time
as found to be 71% by the GC–MS technique. The remaining supernatant
components were allowed to react further for about an hour. GC–MS
results revealed that the reaction did not proceed further, when the
catalyst has been removed, which then debars the possibility of the
leaching of active metal species. Further, ICP-MS was also carried
out and it was found that there were no traces of copper in the supernatant.

2.5 Recyclability Test
Recyclability
and reusability are considered indispensible parameters to assess
the feasibility of any heterogeneous catalyst. The recyclability of
hybrid magnetic CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) catalyst in the synthesis of benzimidazole motifs
was analyzed under the optimum reaction conditions using aniline and
benzylamine as test substrates (Figure 10). Upon completion of the reaction, the
catalyst was recovered via an external magnet and washed thoroughly
with acetone to remove traces of previous reaction mixture and then
dried well under vacuum. The recovered catalyst was then used for
successive runs of the same reaction. It was concluded that the catalyst
could not only be retrieved successfully but also be used for eight
subsequent cycles. The results were further validated by SEM and VSM
analyses of the recovered catalyst (Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information). SEM images showed that no
notable change in the size and morphology of recovered catalyst was
observed. In addition, the recovered catalyst also exhibited sufficient
magnetization value, which allows its facile separation from the reaction
mixture via an external magnet. Thus, the synthesized catalyst was
found to be stable under applied reaction conditions.

10 h].

2.6 Comparison
of Catalytic Activity of CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) with
the Literature Precedents
A comprehensive literature survey
suggests that the as-synthesized catalyst displayed its predominance
over previously reported protocols (Table S3, Supporting Information). This is for the first time that a hybrid
MOF-based heterogeneous catalyst having high concentration of active
catalytic sites has been employed for the synthesis of benzimidazole
scaffolds. The presence of a large number of catalytic sites onto
the surface of MOF leads to additional binding of substrate molecules.
Besides, CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)-catalyzed protocol is also superior in terms of ambient
reaction conditions, high turnover number, extensive functional group
tolerance, catalyst recyclability, and magnetic retrievability. Additionally,
the present study replaces hazardous solvent DMSO with an environmentally
benign solvent, “water”. The catalysts that have been
reported earlier are homogeneous in nature, which undergoes decomposition
immediately after the reaction and thus could not be recovered. On
the contrary, the phenomenal structure of MOF hinders catalyst deactivation
due to spatial separation of metal centers by organic linkers and
thus meticulously overcomes this disadvantage. Moreover, the present
catalyst could be magnetically retrieved and recycled for eight successive
cycles without any appreciable loss in its catalytic activity. Thus,
the present methodology is an attractive alternative for the synthesis
of benzimidazole moieties.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel hybrid magnetic metal-organic framework CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) having
high concentration of reactive metal centers as catalytic sites was
fabricated using a chemical bonding approach. The intricately designed
CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)-based
hybrid MOF exhibited unrivaled catalytic performance in the synthesis
of a broad spectrum of benzimidazoles motifs via oxidative cross-coupling
reaction. The modification of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles
with APTES before the assembly process is crucial, as covalent anchoring
between CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2 and Cu(5-NIPA) renders the material with high chemical stability,
prudent durability, excellent magnetic response, and good reproducibility
without ruining the eccentric structure of MOF. Moreover, it combines
the commendatory attributes of both magnetic properties of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and remarkable characteristics
of MOF. Apart from incomparable catalytic activity, the copper-based
MOF catalyst demonstrated broad substrate scope, excellent conversion
percentage, and high turnover number, and thus a diverse range of
benzimidazole scaffolds could be synthesized. The magnetic retrievability
of the synthesized catalyst permits its repetitive use in the concerned
reaction for consecutive cycles, without any appreciable loss in its
catalytic activity and further catalyst also exhibits excellent durability
as apparent through heterogeneity test. Besides, the present protocol
also employs green reaction conditions (water as the reaction solvent).
We anticipated that this novel hybrid MOF-based catalyst that employs
water as the reaction solvent will offer a new avenue to economic
oxidation catalysts. Moreover, these materials are plausible to be
fruitful catalysts for widespread organic transformations and for
the synthesis of pharmaceutically pertinent architectures.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Methods
Tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS) (99.9%), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)
(98%), and 5-nitroisophthalic acid (5-NIPA) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich,
Fluka, and TCI Chemicals Pvt Ltd., respectively. Copper acetate, ferric
chloride, and cobalt chloride were commercially acquired from Sisco
Research Laboratory (SRL). All other starting materials and reagents
were of analytical grade and obtained from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd.

4.2 Instrumentation
Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained through the KBr pellet method
in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 using a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 2000 FT-IR spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was
performed using a Bruker, D8 Advance (Karlsruhe, Bundesland, Germany)
diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate
of 4°/min in the 2θ range of 5–80° (λ
= 0.15405 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
was conducted using the TECNAI G2 T30, U-TWIN electron
microscope to deduce information regarding the shape and size of the
nanoparticles. Besides TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was
carried out to determine the morphology and shape of nanoparticles
using a Tescan Mira 3 field emission SEM instrument. First, the samples
were prepared by loading on a carbon tape and further coating was
done with a thin layer of gold using a sputter coater. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (equipped with the SEM instrument)
was employed for the elemental mapping of the nanocomposites. Energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectroscopy was also carried out using
a Fischerscope X-ray XAN-FAD BC. A EV-9, Microsense, ADE vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM) was employed for obtaining the magnetization
curves of bare and immobilized nanoparticles at r.t. in an applied
magnetic field sweeping between −10 000 and 10 000
Oe. The thermal stability of the catalyst was determined using a PerkinElmer
Pyris diamond TGA/differential thermal analysis. For obtaining the
data, the sample was heated from room temperature to 800 °C in
N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and gas
flow of 200 mL/min. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) analysis was also carried out using ICP-MS (model no.: 7700)
to quantify the amount of copper loading onto the catalyst. An Anton
Paar Multiwave 3000 microwave instrument equipped with a temperature
and pressure sensor was utilized for the microwave-assisted digestion
of the catalyst. All of the derived products were analyzed and confirmed
through the GC–MS hyphenated technique that was conducted using
an Agilent gas chromatograph (6850 GC) with an HP-5MS 5% phenyl methyl
siloxane capillary column (30.0 m × 250 μm × 0.25
μm) and a quadrupole mass filter equipped with 5975 mass selective
detector using helium as the carrier gas. The isolated yield of 2-substituted
benzimidazoles was confirmed by 1H NMR (400 MHz) using
a JEOL JNM-AXCP 400.

4.3 Synthesis of Catalyst
4.3.1 Preparation of Amine-Functionalized Silica-Coated
Cobalt Ferrite Nanoparticles
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)
of CoFe2O4 were synthesized via a facile one-pot
solvothermal method that has been reported previously in the literature
with slight modifications.59 First, CoCl2·6H2O (148.7 mg, 0.625 mmol) and FeCl3·6H2O (337.9 mg, 1.25 mmol) were dissolved
by magnetic stirring at 50 °C in 10 mL of ethylene glycol to
form a homogeneous solution. Then, 900 mg of sodium acetate (NaAc)
and 500 mg of PEG-6000 were added and the stirring was continued for
another 30 min. The above mixed liquor was transferred to a sealed
Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was held at 160 °C
for 16 h. The resultant black product was magnetically separated and
washed with double-deionized water. Finally, the obtained CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (0.2 g) were dried at 60 °C
for 6 h.

Thereafter, the silica-encapsulated cobalt ferrite
microspheres (CoFe2O4@SiO2) were
prepared by Stöber sol–gel process.61 In a typical procedure, CoFe2O4 microspheres
(100 mg, 0.426 mmol) were dispersed ultrasonically in a solution containing
mixture of 80 mL of ethanol and 20 mL of deionized water. Subsequently,
1.5 mL of ammonia followed by 1 mL of TEOS were added to the mixture
solution and the solution was incessantly stirred at room temperature
for 24 h. Then, the product was collected by external magnetic forces,
washed several times with ethanol and deionized water, and dried under
vacuum. Finally, the surface modification of the CoFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles was accomplished through the
introduction of amine groups. For obtaining amine-functionalized silica-coated
cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2) nanoparticles, 2 mL of APTES was added to a well-dispersed
solution of 1.0 g of CoFe2O4@SiO2 in 200 mL of ethanol.62 The resulting
mixture was stirred continuously at 80 °C for 6 h. The CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2 nanocomposites
were separated via external magnetic field, washed with ethanol several
times to remove the unreacted silylating agent, and then finally dried
under vacuum.

4.3.2 Preparation of MOFs Decorated
with Amine-Functionalized
Cobalt Ferrite Nanoparticles
A versatile step-by-step assembly
strategy was utilized to fabricate the hybrid magnetic CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)-based MOF.35 The as-synthesized amine-functionalized silica-coated
cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2) nanoparticles were dispersed in 10 mL of aqueous solution
of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (0.199 g,
1 mmol) and 5-nitroisophthalic acid (5-NIPA) (0.213 g, 1 mmol). The
mixture was first stirred for 15 min to form a gel and then sealed
in a Parr reaction vessel and heated at 100 °C for 2 days (Scheme 2). After naturally
cooling down to room temperature, very uniform crystalline powder
was obtained and further isolated via external magnetic forces. The
product was then washed with water and then dried under vacuum to
generate the hybrid magnetic CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA) catalyst.

4.4 General Procedure for Hybrid Magnetic CoFe2O4@SiO2@NH2@Cu(5-NIPA)-Catalyzed
Synthesis of Benzimidazoles via C–H Functionalization Strategy
To a reaction vessel containing a stirred solution of aniline (1.0
mmol), catalyst (25 mg/0.32 mol %), sodium azide (3.0 mmol), acetic
acid (5.0 mmol), TBHP (3 mmol) in water (1 mL), and benzylamine (1.2
mmol) were added successively. The resulting reaction mixture was
stirred at 70 °C for an appropriate period of time, and the progress
of the reaction was monitored via thin-layer chromatography. After
completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature
and the catalyst was separated simply via an external bar magnet.
Then, the workup was done by first treating the reaction mixture with
saturated NaHCO3 (5 mL) and then extracting using ethyl
acetate. The resulting organic layer was separated and then dried
over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Finally, the products were analyzed
and confirmed using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS).

4.5 General Procedure for Leaching Experiments
To a reaction vessel, aniline (1.0 mmol), catalyst (25 mg/0.32
mol %), sodium azide (3.0 mmol), acetic acid (5.0 mmol), TBHP (3 mmol)
in water (1 mL), and benzylamine (1.2 mmol) were added successively.
The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C for half
the reaction time (i.e., for 5 h). After stirring, the catalyst was
removed magnetically and the conversion percentage was determined
by GC–MS analysis. The resulting supernatant was further subjected
to heating for a prolonged time duration. The GC–MS analysis
of the resultant supernatant was carried out once again to check whether
any leaching of the active metallic species occurred or not.

4.6 General Procedure for Reusability Experiments
To a
reaction vessel, aniline (1.0 mmol), catalyst (25 mg/0.32
mol %), sodium azide (3.0 mmol), acetic acid (5.0 mmol), TBHP (3 mmol)
in water (1 mL), and benzylamine (1.2 mmol) were added successively.
After completion of the reaction, catalyst was recovered via an external
magnet and washed thoroughly with acetone to remove traces of previous
reaction mixture and then dried well under vacuum. The recovered catalyst
was then used for successive runs of the same reaction.
