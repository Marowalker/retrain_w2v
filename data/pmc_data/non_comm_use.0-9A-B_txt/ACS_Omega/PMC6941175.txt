A novel clay-reinforced polycaprolactone/chitosan/curcumin
(PCl/CS/Clay/Cur)
composite film was fabricated in this study. The prepared Cur-loading
composite films were characterized with attenuated total reflection
Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
atomic force microscopy, water contact angle, differential scanning
calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction, and
the results showed good dispersion of clay in the composite films.
The addition of nanoclay was found to significantly increase the tensile
strength. Also, the clay-enhanced drug-loading films exhibited better
controlled-release profiles of Cur than those membranes without clay.
Skin disinfection test demonstrated that the curcumin-loaded film
could protect wound from bacterial infection. Cytotoxicity analysis
proved the good biocompatibility of the composite films. The clay-enhanced
Cur-loading films might be promising candidates for wound care.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Skin injuries are one
of the most common injuries in daily life.
Both physical and chemical damages cause destruction of the skin.
In the process of wound healing, inflammation is a very fatal obstacle,
especially for chronic wounds, which often leads to skin destruction
and serious complications.1 Hence, to accelerate
wound healing, it is crucial to protect the wound from inflammation.
When suffering from inflammation, the human body will respond and
release reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS belongs to one of the well-investigated
inflammatory mediators that are chemical species containing chemically
reactive oxygen.2 It is believed that involvement
of antioxidants against ROS will be beneficial to wound healing.3 Cur, the extract product of the root of Curcuma longa L., is a well-known anti-inflammatory,
antimicrobial, and anticancer drug agent. The drug has been applied
to treat diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, and other
inflammatory diseases.4,5 Cur is a hydrophobic polyphenol
component and has been widely used as traditional and culinary medicine
in Asia. The pharmacological and biological efficacy of Cur has been
clearly established by extensive research studies.5 Previous studies have evidenced that Cur can be capable
of inhibiting macrophages and monocytes from releasing tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) (an inflammatory cytokine)6,7 and interleukin-8 (IL-8), as well as regenerating and functional
reconstructing skin tissue by facilitating the formation of transforming
growth factor (TGF-β).8 However,
concerning the potential cytotoxicity exhibited by Cur at a high concentration,
controlled release of Cur by incorporating it with polymeric scaffolds
might be a suitable method for application in wound dressing.9

Among polymeric scaffolds, polycaprolactone
(PCl)/chitosan (CS)
films have their significant advantages. PCl is a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration-approved synthesis polymer. With the merits of being
stabilized, elastomeric, and highly flexible, PCl is usually used
as the matrix of wound dressing.10−12 CS, a naturally derived
biopolymer, is the only positively charged polysaccharide. There are
many reports regarding the improvement of the biocompatible, biodegradable,
and antimicrobial properties for wound dressing and tissue scaffold.13−17 In addition, CS has good performance on the controlled release of
drugs.18 The PCl/CS membranes exhibit important
values on wound therapeutics. Salgado et al. had fabricated PCl/CS
films for wound repair and found the membranes to be biocompatible
and degradable.19 Poornima and Korrapati
designed a PCl/CS nanofiber wound dressing, which could sustainably
release ferulic acid until 120 h.20 However,
the poor mechanical property of PCl/CS hinders its further development
in the clinic.

In the last two decades, polymer nanocomposites
have been widely
investigated. Montmorillonite (MMT) clay is a kind of layered silicate
that is abundant, cheap, and stiffly.21 In the human body, there exist many minerals, which are also the
main components of clay. Thus, a clay nanosheet with noncytotoxicity
and biodegradability is a promising candidate as nanoreinforcement.22 It is noteworthy that the charge found along
the edges of clay is positive, while the charge on each face of clay
is negative, making the clay nanosheet attractive.23 Owing to its unique structure, clay is equipped with enhanced
interactions with cells or biopolymers and high drug loading capacity.

Therefore, in the present study, clay-enhanced PCl/CS/Cur composite
films are fabricated through spin coating. The physicochemical properties
are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated
total reflection Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Skin disinfection test is applied
here to assess the antibacterial activity. Finally, the in vitro cytotoxicity
is evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide
(MTT) method.

2 Results and Discussion
All the drug
loading solutions displayed an orange-yellow color.
As shown in Figure 1, the color of PCl/CS/Cur was almost the same as PCl/Cur, and the
solutions were transparent, which demonstrated that PCl, CS, and Cur
were dissolved well in the HAc/H2O solvent. However, since
clay did not dissolve in the solvent but dispersed in the solution,
the addition of clay sheets changed the solutions. The more clay was
added, the less transparent was the displayed appearance. In the end,
well-dispersed solutions were obtained and deaerated before further
use.

PCl/Cur, PCl/CS/Cur, PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-1, PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-2, PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3,
and PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-4, respectively.

2.1 Characterization of the Cur-Loading Films
SEM was used to observe the morphology images of the surface and
cross section. PCl/Cur was smoother than other cases with less little
holes caused by different dissolution rates, as shown in Figure 2a. CS was dissolved
in acid solution easily, leading to the formation of a rougher surface
and bigger holes (Figure 2b) during the process of liquid–liquid phase separation.
When clay was involved in the system, the situation began to change.
According to Figure 2c–e, the surface became compact and smooth with the increase
of clay, on account of the good blending of hydrophobic montmorillonite
I.28E clay with PCl, which could help prevent the dissolution of CS.
However, a raised surface can be found in Figure 2f, for there was excess clay in the system.

The cross-section morphology of the drug-loading
films was investigated,
and the results are shown in Figure 3. Significant differences were found between Cur-loading
PCl, PCl/CS, and PCl/CS/Clay films. PCl/Cur exhibited a dense, spongy-like
cross-section morphology with a disconnected structure (Figure 3a), while a well-connected
spongy network was discovered in other films (Figure 3b–f). With the increase of clay, the
aperture became smaller and homogeneous. That led to the formation
of a tremendous surface area, which was beneficial to the controlled
release of Cur.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (500 ×
500 nm) were obtained
to measure the surface roughness of prepared membranes, and different
roughness parameters (Ra, Rq, and Rz) are summarized
in Table 1. As shown
in Figure 4 and Table 1, the film of PCl/Cur
displayed a relatively smooth surface morphology. The roughness parameters
of PCl/CS/Cur were higher than PCl/Cur. It can be seen that roughness
decreased with the increase of clay, indicating the good dispersion
of clay in PCl/CS/Cur. However, the surface becomes rougher for PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-4,
which might be caused by the aggregates of clay on the surface.

For commercial application, thermal stability should
be evaluated.24 As shown in Figure 5, the results of TG and DTG
were displayed.
According to Figure 5a, the decomposition temperature of the films was around 410 °C,
which was ascribed to the decomposition temperature of PCl. When mixing
with CS or clay, the decomposition temperature had changed with a
little blue shift but still met the requirements of sterilization
in clinical practice. There existed a small peak around 70 °C,
which belonged to the free water of films. As depicted in Figure 5b, all films underwent
two weight loss processes. The first process began at the temperature
below 100 °C, likely attributed to the decrease in humidity or
the loss of water by evaporation. Obviously, the second weight loss
process happened at about 410 °C, assigned to the decomposition
of PCl/Cur, PCl/CS/Cur, or PCl/CS/Cur/Clay. In TG curves, overlapping
was found between the investigated Cur-loading films, indicating that
the polymers would co-decompose under the decomposition temperature.

Figure 5 (a) DTG
and (b) TG curves of the Cur-loading films.

The results of DSC analysis are presented in Figure 6. The typical melting
point of PCl appeared
at the temperature of 61 °C. It can be seen from Figure 6 that the incorporation of
Cur and CS did not change the melting point. Note that the change
was too small to influence the application in the clinical field.

Figure 6 DSC curves
of the prepared Cur-loading membranes.

ATR-FTIR was used to assess the chemical compositions
on the surface,
and the results are shown in Figure 7. Typical FTIR peaks of PCl occurred around 2942–2865,
1732, 1471–1365, and 1239 cm–1. These peaks
belonged to symmetric/asymmetric stretching vibrations of −CH2, stretching vibrations of —C=O, bending vibrations
of −CH2, and vibrations of −COO, respectively.
As shown in Figure 7a, the peaks of CS were observed at 3200–3400, 2872, 1650,
and 1374 cm–1, related to the −OH/–NH2 stretch, aliphatic C–H stretch, NH group bending vibration,
and −C–O stretching, respectively.25 Characteristic peaks at 3642 cm–1 (O–H
stretching) and 1045 cm–1 (Si–O) corresponded
to montmorillonite clay, in accordance with the study of Noori and
colleagues.26 For Cur, the C=C benzene
ring stretching vibrations showed a peak at 1521 cm–1, and C–H bond olefinic bending vibrations displayed a peak
at 1430 cm–1, while the C–O vibration occurred
at 858 cm–1. However, due to the low mass ratio
and overlap exhibited by the high-intensity FTIR peaks of PCl, the
characteristic peaks of CS, clay, and Cur were difficult to ascertain,
as displayed in Figure 7b. When the mass ratio of CS increased to 10:2 and 10:4, the peaks
at 3200–3400 and 1650 cm–1 were discovered
(Figure S1), which demonstrated the above speculation.

PCl, CS, and clay and (b) prepared Cur-loading
films.

The hydrophobic–hydrophilic properties of
the drug-loading
films were investigated by water contact angle (WCA) analysis, and
the results are exhibited in Figure 8. It is well known that PCl is a hydrophobic polymer
with a WCA value of 125°. The addition of Cur decreased the WCA
to 82°. For PCl/CS/Cur, the hydrophilic −OH and −NH2 groups of chitosan were transferred to the surface, which
further slightly reduced the WCA of PCl/CS/Cur to 76°. For PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-1,
the WCA value had a slight increase. The speculated reason was that,
with small amounts of clay to CS, exfoliated structures were formed,
resulting in the partial sealing of CS.27 With the increase of clay, the structures became intercalary, and
the WCA decreased. No significant differences were found between groups
of different PCl/CS/Cur/Clay (p > 0.05), indicating
that the clay was mostly embedded in the interior of the drug-loading
films.

Figure 8 WCA analysis of curcumin-loaded films.

XRD analysis was conducted to measure the crystal
structure of
the Cur-loading films, and the XRD curves are shown in Figure 9. It was well known that angles
at 21.4° and 23.8° were the typical XRD peaks of PCl, while
Cur was highly crystalline,28 exhibiting
many intense and sharp peaks mainly presented at 17.3°, 21.3°,
23.4°, and 24.7°. However, the typical peaks of Cur disappeared,
suggesting the successful loading of Cur into PCl. In the report of
Qi et al.,29 characteristic diffractograms
of CS that occurred at around 21.8° were descripted. It can be
seen from Figure 9,
for PCl/CS/Cur, that the intension of PCl peaks decreased and the
typical Cur peaks appeared. It was conjectured that the dissolution
of CS led to the appearance of unsealed Cur. A previous study indicated
that clay showed a diffraction profile at around 7.2°.30 In PCl/CS/Cur/Clay membranes, a clay pattern
was not found, while the intensity of 2θ = 21.4° and 23.8°
was strengthened with the increase of clay, except for PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-4,
which revealed the good dispersibility of clay nanosheets in the fabricated
Cur-loaded membranes. It was found that exfoliated clay played a role
as a nucleating agent, resulting in increasing crystallinity. When
intercalated into clay galleries, however, the crystallinity of PCl
decreased.31

Figure 9 XRD diagram of prepared
Cur-loading membranes.

The mechanical properties of the Cur-loading films
were assessed,
and the results of tensile strength are displayed in Figure 10. A digital photo of PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3
is displayed in Figure 10a. It can be discovered from Figure 10b,c that the poor tensile strength of PCl/CS
(1.04 ± 0.01 MPa) and PCl/CS/Cur (1.94 ± 0.07 MPa) could
not satisfy the requirements of native skin (5–30 MPa).25 The tensile strength of clay-enhanced Cur-loading
films increased first and then decreased. Compared to films without
clay, the tensile strength of clay-enhanced Cur-loading membranes
were enhanced dramatically (p < 0.05), which was
probably on account of the interaction between clay and PCl/CS and
the increase in crystallinity. There were no significant differences
between groups embedded with different amounts of clay (p = 0.699 and p = 0.967 for PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-1 vs
PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-2 and PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-2 vs PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3, respectively).
Nevertheless, there was excess clay in PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-4, with the
reduction of tensile strength, possibly due to the presence of clay
agglomerates. These findings were consistent with XRD analysis.

curves of the Cur-loading membranes.

2.2 In Vitro Cur Release
The release
behavior of different Cur-loading membranes in PBS (pH 7.4) under
the temperature of 37 °C is presented in Figure 11. In a controlled and sustained manner,
Cur was released from the drug-loading films. It can be observed from Figure 11a that, within
12 h, over 64.21% of Cur was released from PCl/Cur, while 44.68% of
Cur was released from PCl/CS/Cur owing to the property of controlled
release exhibited by CS. Montmorillonite clay was found to be beneficial
for controlled release of Cur while improving the textural properties
(Figure 11b). The
more clay was added, the less cumulative Cur was released. The release
profile of PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-4 was similar to that of PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3,
suggesting the saturated capacity of clay.

Figure 11 Release profiles ((a)
within 12 h and (b) within 168 h) of Cur
from the prepared membranes.

CS was a natural polysaccharide, which could wrap
up drugs through
a physical or chemical reaction and prevent them from quick release.32 Drugs would be released in a controlled manner
with the degradation of CS.33 Owing to
good absorbability and ion exchange capacity, the clay was able to
inhibit or delay release of drugs.34,35 Via an ion
exchange process, CS was capable of exchanging the metal interlayer
cations of clay, generating a strong cross-linked structure in the
hybrid film.36 Herein, the capability of
controlled release was enhanced. This was proved by previous studies.
Kevadiya et al. fabricated CS/clay/alginate composite hydrogel beads
for oral drug delivery.37 Diclofenac sodium
was found to be released in a controlled manner from the hydrogel.
In the research of Hua et al., compared to pure chitosan beads, the
incorporation of clay enhanced the drug entrapment and reduced the
drug release.38

To study the release
mechanism of curcumin from the prepared films, n,
ln k, and R2 of the plot
of ln(Mt/M∞) versus ln t were calculated.
The obtained results are shown in Table 2. It was found that, within 12 h, the values
of n of the drug-loading films were 0.5 < n < 1, indicating that curcumin was released via non-Fickian
diffusion for all the tested films, which occurred when the diffusion
and relaxation rates were comparable. However, after 12 h of release,
the n values were lower than 0.5, which suggested
that the release of curcumin was depending on Fickian diffusion.

2.3 Skin Disinfection Test
Pig skin is
known to be similar with the composition and structure of human skin
tissue. Therefore, pig skin disinfection tests are instructive and
meaningful to clinical use on the human body in the future. The digital
photographs and SEM images of wounds and curcumin-loaded film (PCl/CS/Clay-4)
are illustrated in Figures 12 and 13. After 2 days of incubation,
it is shown in Figure 12 that many yellow spots and mucus are seen on the control wound without
protection. However, the wound protected by PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3 had
no visible yellow spot, suggesting the effective restraint on bacterial
infection showed by PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3. Further, the surface morphologies
of the wound sites were observed by SEM. As displayed in Figure 13a,a-1, for the
wound without protection, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria aggregated on the surface. The bacteria grew well on the
wound and formed a thick biofilm. Nevertheless, there were barely
any bacteria on the wound covered by a PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3 film, which
indicated that the film successfully protected the wound from bacterial
infection (Figure 13b,b-1). It was discovered from Figure 13c,c-1 that a few bacteria were found to
attach on the film surface and the cytomembranes of bacteria were
broken, demonstrating the inhibiting effect of PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3.

2.4 Cytocompatibility Studies
In vitro
cytocompatibility, playing a crucial factor for wound dressing, was
assessed by MTT assay and SEM observation in the present study. L929
fibroblasts were employed in this investigation and incubated in the
96 cell wells. The extracts of Cur-loading membranes were cultivated
with the L929 cells for 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days. At each time point,
the 96 cell wells were taken out to measure the optical density (OD).
As illustrated in Figure 14, it could be seen that OD values increased with incubation
time. After 3 days of cocultivation, the tested cells were less than
the control cells but were still suitable for wound dressing application.
It might due to the reason that it took time for cells to adapt to
the growing environment. However, after 5 days of cultivation, the
cell proliferation of investigated samples caught up with the cell
proliferation of the control, indicating the good cytocompatibility
of the Cur-loading films. The same finding was observed in the drug-loading
groups equipped with different amounts of clay, demonstrating that
the extract of clay was nontoxic. It was reported by Hsu et al. that
clay/chitosan showed good in vivo compatibility.39 The histopathological study of Maisanba et al. showed that
the PLA/Clay-1 nanocomposite displayed no toxic effects.40 Clay was a nanomaterial that showed no clear
evidences of systemic toxicity even at doses of 5000 mg/kg.41 In this study, all the clay-involved drug-loading
membranes showed no side effect on the cell proliferation. It could
be speculated that the increase of clay will not exhibit cytotoxicity
on L929 cells. Cells attached on the films were viewed by SEM, and
the images are shown in Figure 15. L929 fibroblasts grew well on the curcumin-loading
films, and the cells kept their fusiform or spread shapes. Cells on
PCl/CS/curcumin were less but healthy, which might be due to the positive
charge of CS. However, cells spread well on the clay-involved films
on account of the increase of hydrophilicity. In vitro cytocompatibility
analysis confirmed the biocompatibility of the Cur-loading membranes
with/without clay enhancement, implying their potential in the field
of wound dressing.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, clay-enhanced
Cur-loading films with appropriate
mechanical properties were fabricated through the method of spin coating.
To evaluate the performance of the prepared membranes, PCl/Cur and
PCl/CS/Cur were also produced. Clay-enhanced Cur-loading films were
found to have a porous sponge-like morphology with disconnected structures.
The SEM observations indicated their superior controlled-release property,
which was demonstrated by the release profile in vitro. It was found
that, within 12 h, curcumin was released via non-Fickian diffusion
for all the tested films, which occurred when the diffusion and relaxation
rates were comparable. However, after 12 h of release, the release
of curcumin was depending on Fickian diffusion. Skin disinfection
test demonstrated that the curcumin-loaded film could protect the
wound from S. aureus infection. The
physical and chemical properties were investigated by FTIR, TG, DSC,
XRD, and WCA, showing the good dispersion of clay in the drug-loading
films. Meanwhile, the addition of clay significantly increased the
tensile strength of PCl/CS/Cur from 1.94 to 11.81 MPa (PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-1).
Cur-loading membranes with/without clay exhibited noncytotoxicity
on L929 cells. The clay-enhanced Cur-loading membrane is a promising
candidate for wound dressing.

Before spin coating, the prepared solutions were vacuum-degassed,
and the glass plates were washed with water and ethanol and underwent
ultrasonication. The liquid drop was casted at the speed of 600 rpm
for 10 s. After finishing spin coating, the glass sheets were immediately
transferred into ultrapure water. Flat membranes were obtained through
liquid–liquid phase separation. For comparison, PCl/Cur and
PCl/CS/Cur were also fabricated. Schematic illustration in Scheme 1 depicts the fabrication
process of membranes.

Equipped with silicon TESP cantilevers (Shimadzu
SPM-9600, Japan), a Dimension 3100 Nanoscope IV was used in this study
to investigate AFM images and the surface roughness. At room temperature
in air, the observations were conducted in noncontact (taping) mode.42

Scanning from 5° to 40°, XRD
(Netherlands) analysis was
performed under the current of 45 mA and the voltage of 40 kV.

Thermal stability was analyzed by DSC (DSC200-PC, Netzsch, Germany)
and TG (Netzsch Co., Germany) tests. For DSC analysis, the test temperature
ranged from 20 to 150 °C with a constant heating rate of 10 °C/min
under a nitrogen flow. For TG measurement, the membranes were investigated
at a heating rate of 15 °C/min from ambient temperature to 800
°C under a N2 atmosphere.

ATR-FTIR (Nicolet
560, America) was used to evaluate the chemical
characteristics of prepared films. In a dry atmosphere at room temperature,
the spectra were tested in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4.0 cm–1.

WCA with
a video capture (Attension Theta, Biolin Scientific, Sweden)
and TGA (Netzsch Co., Germany) were utilized to investigate the physicochemical
properties. The samples were cut to a 1.5 cm2 square and
attached on a glass slide. The static WCA results were measured after
10 μL of DI water dropping on the surface of the nanofiber mats.

4.4 Cur Release Profiles
Using UV spectroscopy,
a serial dilution of Cur from 0.5 to 15 μg/mL was tested at
424 nm to obtain the calibration curve. A linear equation was fitted
as A = 0.0503C – 0.0121 and R2 = 0.9991, where A and C represented absorbance and drug concentration, respectively.

Through the dialysis method, the Cur release profile was evaluated.
Briefly, the receptor medium had 0.5% Tween-80 (v/v) in PBS (pH 7.4),
and the tests were carried out at 37 °C with gentle vibration.
The known amount of drug-loaded membranes was placed into 5 mL of
receptor medium and then put in 15 mL centrifuge tubes for 7 days.
The release medium was withdrawn to measure the absorbance at proper
time intervals. The fresh medium was then added to keep the volume
constant. All the tested samples were conducted in triplicate.

Mathematical modeling was applied to investigate the release behavior
of curcumin release from the films. Calculated from eq 1, the release mechanism for drug
release can be speculated. 1  In the equation, the fraction
release of curcumin in time t was represented by Mt/M∞, the
constant characteristic of the system was reflected by k, while the diffusion exponent characteristic of the release mechanism
was represented by n. If n = 0.5,
then the release mechanism was normal Fickian diffusion; if n = 1.0, then the release mechanism was case II diffusion;
and if n = 0.5–1.0, then the release mechanism
would be non-Fickian diffusion.43

4.5 Skin Disinfection Test
According
to a previous study,44 the S. aureus infection model was conducted to evaluate
the bacterial inhibition ability of the curcumin-loaded film with
a little modification. Briefly, S. aureus bacteria were revived and cultivated at the temperature of 37 °C.
The tested concentration of bacteria was set at 108 CFU/mL,
which was confirmed by the absorbency at the wavelength of 600 nm.
The bacterial dispersion was prepared before use. In vitro sterile
pig skins were cut into 4 cm × 4 cm squares, and the groove-shaped
square portion with the size of 1 cm × 1 cm was removed from
the pig skin as the wound site. PCl/CS/Cur/Clay-3 was cut into a 1
cm × 1 cm square and placed on the wound site. Then, 10 μL
of bacterial dispersion was added on the film. The pig skin with a
wound site only was applied as control. All the pig skins were cultivated
under the temperature of 37 °C. After 2 days of co-cultivation,
the pig skins and films were taken out and gently washed three times
with normal saline and photographed by a digital camera. Subsequently,
the pig skins and films were fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5%) and
dehydrated with graded ethanol (0, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%).
The bacteria morphology was visualized using SEM.

4.6 Cytotoxicity
By detecting the cell
proliferation, the cytotoxicity of the prepared Cur-loading films
was evaluated in vitro by the MTT method,45,46 and the cell morphology was studied by SEM observation. A total
of 5 × 103 L929 fibroblast cells per well were seeded
in 96-well tissue plates before use. Briefly, the tested cases were
made to 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 squares before sterilization
and co-cultivated with 2.1 mL of culture medium for 1 day. Then, 200
μL of the extractive medium was introduced into the 96-well
plastic tissue plates. The incubation condition was kept constant
with the temperature of 37 °C and 5% CO2. At different
time intervals (1 day, 3 days, and 5 days), the cell-seeded plates
were taken out from the incubator. MTT with the volume of 20 μL
was introduced to each well. Blue formazan crystals were formed after
4 h of incubation. After dissolving the crystal with dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), the plates were shaken in the dark for 15 min. Utilizing a
microplate (MK3, Labsystems, Finland), the absorbance values were
measured at the wavelength of 492 nm. To measure the cell morphology
on the drug-loading films, cells of 1 × 104 were seeded
on the 1.5 cm2 square films for 4 h, and subsequently,
400 μL of medium was added. After incubating for 3 days, the
films were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and washed three times
with PBS. Then, gradient ethyl alcohol solutions (30, 50, 75, 80,
90, 95, and 100%) were used to dehydrate. Finally, the films were
sprayed with Au and viewed by SEM.

4.7 Statistical Analysis
In the present
study, IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA)
was used to conduct the statistical analysis. Single-factor analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine the differences between
groups. If the differences were significant, then the p value would be below 0.05.
