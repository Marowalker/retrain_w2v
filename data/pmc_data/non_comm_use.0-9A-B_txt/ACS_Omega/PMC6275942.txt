A 16-electron iridium organometallic
is reacted with carbon monoxide
to form an 18-electron CO-adduct. This CO-adduct is stable for weeks
in the solid state, but quickly reverts to its parent 16-e complex
in tetrahydrofuran solution, releasing CO(g). Using a simple
methodology, we show that this gas can subsequently be used to perform
a carbonylation reaction on another molecule.

Introduction
Carbonylation reactions
are used for the large-scale production
of aldehydes (via hydroformylation) and carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic
acid via the Cativa process).1 In such
large-scale industrial processes, the utilization of carbon monoxide
cylinders is unreplaceable because of their cost-effectiveness as
well as for practical reasons (e.g., transport and storage of large
quantities of carbon monoxide). However, carbon monoxide is a poisonous
gas that has no smell or taste (so-called “silent killer”).2 The toxicity of carbon monoxide makes the utilization
of CO cylinders difficult for small-scale reactions in laboratories,
and the purchase and handling of such cylinders are strictly regulated.
Therefore, there has been a long and significant academic and industrial
interest in the development of materials capable of reversibly capturing
and releasing CO.3−6 A number of CO surrogates which can avoid the utilization of CO
gas cylinders have been developed by Skrydstrup and co-workers7−13 and others.14−18 However, this is still an extremely challenging quest owing to the
difficulty to desorb the ligand from existing carbon monoxide-containing
materials,19−23 without irreversibly damaging them.24

We have recently reported a simple strategy for the fabrication
of electron-deficient organometallics-containing gels that allow the
nearly quantitative capture of a known amount of carbon monoxide.25 Importantly, we demonstrated the straightforward
release of CO from the metallated gels and the recovery of the original
materials at ambient temperature and ambient pressure by simply dipping
the CO-containing gels in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. However,
we observed that after some minutes in THF (and thus after several
recycling steps), the structures of the gels tend to loss their integrity,
which limits the reusability of these materials and some of their
potential applications.

Here, we report a new strategy for the
controlled release of known
quantities of carbon monoxide, without formulating organometallic
complexes into gels. The electron-deficient organometallic complex
[Ir(η5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato)]
(1; Scheme 1) is shown to exhibit a peculiar reactivity
with the σ-donor, π-acceptor carbon monoxide ligand, leading
to the formation of the 18-electron adduct [Ir(η5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato) (CO)] ([1-CO]). The ability of complex [1-CO] to release
carbon monoxide under mild and controlled conditions is studied, and
its application as a source of CO for carbonylation reactions is investigated.

Results
and Discussion
The reactivity in solution of [Ir(η5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato)]
(1) with CO was first investigated in dichloromethane
solution (Figure 1a).
Iridium complex 1 readily forms the 18-electron adduct
[Ir(η5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene) (benzene-1,2-dithiolato)(CO)]
([1-CO]) in solution when CO(g) is bubbled
into the solution. UV–visible absorption spectroscopy suggests
the formation of the CO 18-e adducts (Figure 1b), with the dramatic decrease of the absorption
band observed at 440 nm (associated to ligand-to-metal charge-transfer
transitions that are commonly observed in 16-electron complexes26) which is in accordance with the formation of
18-e species for this metal complex.27 The
infrared spectroscopy spectra before and after CO exposure show the
presence of the characteristic CO band at 1900 cm–1 after CO exposure (Figure 1c). 1H NMR spectroscopy confirms the formation
of the CO adduct [1-CO], although the reaction is not
complete with a conversion of ca. 80% (Figures 1d and S1). A time-dependent 1H NMR study (1 mM, CDCl3, 298 K) of [1-CO] shows the decoordination of the CO ligand over time and the return
to the parent complex 1 after 40 h (Figure S2). The molar percentages of [1-CO] in
CDCl3 solution during the release of CO from [1-CO] are presented in Table S1. Slow evaporation
leads to the isolation of [1-CO] solid. Importantly,
the CO spectroscopic signature in the [1-CO] solid is
still observed after storage of the powder at ambient temperature,
in an opened vial, for 1 h and for 4 weeks (Figure S3). Interestingly, the formation of [1-CO] can
also be performed by exposing complex 1 as a solid to
an atmosphere (1 atm) of CO, leading to a gas–solid reaction.

CH2Cl2, 298 K, b) IR (as powders, c) and 1H NMR (CDCl3, 1 mM, 298 K, d) spectra of complexes 1 and [1-CO].

In THF solution, complex [1-CO] also readily
reverses
to the parent complex 1, but after only a few minutes
in solution (Figure 2). The decoordination of the carbon monoxide ligand is faster in
THF than in dichloromethane, which we hypothesize is due to the lower
relative polarity of THF (0.207) compared to that of dichloromethane
(0.309) or chloroform (0.272). This is in accordance with our previous
report in which we found a direct correlation between the polarity
of the solvents and the ability of pseudo electron-deficient organometallics
to release CO when immersed in them.25

Figure 2 Time-dependent 1H NMR spectra (1 mM, deuterated THF,
298 K) of [1-CO] showing the CO decoordination and the
return to the parent complex 1.

The carbon monoxide decoordination in THF solution was investigated
by UV–visible spectroscopy. From the time-dependent UV–visible
spectra shown in Figure 2, the decoordination constant K between complex 1 and the CO ligand was calculated as being 1.1 ± 0.3
× 103 M–1, using the nonlinear Thordarson
Fitting Program.28 The experimental Gibbs
free energy (ΔG°) was obtained from the
Gibbs equation using the calculated value of K and
found to be −4.1 ± 0.4 kcal·mol–1. The 1H NMR spectra of [1-CO] in deuterated
THF over time were also recorded. After 4 h (longer than in the UV–vis
cuvette because of the narrowness and limited air exchange within
the NMR tube), the decoordination of CO is half complete (Figure S4). The molar percentages of [1-CO] in deuterated-THF solution during the release of CO from [1-CO] are presented in Table S2.

It should
be noted that the decoordination of the CO ligand in
THF is much faster for complex 1 than for its carborane
analogue (previously reported as one week for complete decoordination).25 This is consistent with the studies in solution
for both sets of complexes (carborane-containing versus benzene-containing).29 Indeed, in the case of complex 1, one of the sulfur atoms in the MS2C2 chelate
ring acts as a three-electron donor to the metal atom and the other
acts only as a one-electron donor.29 This
gives the metal the favored 18-electron configuration and makes it
unreactive toward bases such as pyridine derivatives, but slightly
reactive toward σ-donor and π-acceptor ligands, such as
carbon monoxide. Thus, the actual structure of complex 1 is a resonance hybrid of the two canonical structures with the sulfur
atoms in the two states, which leads to a pseudo 16-electron configuration.
The carborane-containing analogue of 1 has an unsaturated
16-electron configuration (because of the bulkiness and electron-deficiency
of the carborane ligand), making it more prone to reaction with both
σ-donor and σ-donor and π-acceptor ligands.

The possibility of using the controlled release of CO by [1-CO] in THF as a source of carbon monoxide to perform a
chemical reaction was then investigated. We attempted to transfer
the CO ligand from [1-CO] to the metal center of the
16-electron organometallic complex [Os(η6-p-cym)(1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecarborane-1,2-dithiolato)]
(2) to form [Os(η6-p-cym)(1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecarborane-1,2-dithiolato)(CO)]
([2-CO]).

To do so, a methodology based on the
“small-vial-inside-larger-vial”
setup was used (Figure 3): first, 16 mol equiv of complex 1 (see the Supporting Information for the experimental procedure)
was dissolved in THF in a large vial. CO was bubbled in the solution
for a few minutes, until a change of color from deep red to red-orange
was observed. The CO needle was removed and the vial was left open
for 2 min to allow residual CO(g) to be dispersed in the
atmosphere. Second, 1 mol equiv of complex 2 was dissolved
in CDCl3 (1 mL) in a small vial equipped with a stirrer
bar. This small vial was introduced in the larger vial that was then
closed with a standard plastic cap. The solution in the small vial
was stirred at 500 rpm. After 90 min, the solution in the bigger vial
was observed to be less intense in color. The small vial was removed,
and its content was immediately analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Figure 3 Top: Principle
and experimental prototype for the “small-vial-inside-larger-vial”
setup. Bottom: 1H NMR spectra of complexes 2 and [2-CO] (1 mM, CDCl3, 298 K). [2-CO] is obtained by carbonylation reaction between 2 in
CDCl3 located in a small vial and CO that was released
from the [1-CO] solution in THF in the larger vial.

A color change from dark red (corresponding
to complex 2 in CDCl3) to yellow (corresponding
to [2-CO] in CDCl3) was observed. 1H NMR spectroscopy
(Figure 3) and infrared
spectroscopy (Figure 4) demonstrate the complete formation of the Os complex [2-CO].

To validate our hypothesis that Ir complex [1-CO] can
be used as a substitute (for small-scale reactions) for gas cylinders
as a safer way for the transport, storage, and handling of carbon
monoxide, the following control experiment was carried out: the CO
ligand exchange does not occur when the 18-e Ir complex [1-CO] and the 16-e Os complex 2 are mixed together in THF
solution, probably because the CO escapes the THF solution too quickly.

Conclusions
Our results show that the iridium complex [Ir(η5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato)] (1) can be functionalized with CO to form the CO-adduct [1-CO], either in dichloromethane solution or in the solid state. In the
solid form, [1-CO] is stable over a long period (weeks),
allowing its facile storage and transport. The CO can be released,
when required, by solubilizing [1-CO] in THF in a vial.
Using the hanging basket methodology, it is possible to carbonylate
another metal complex by using a simple “vial-inside-vial”
setup. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the controlled
release of CO from the solution has the potential to generate small
quantities of CO for small-scale reactions. Future work will involve
control of the rate of release of CO from the complex in solution
via design of ligands that will either slow or accelerate the release
of CO. Ruthenium, osmium, and rhodium analogues of the Ir compound
will be synthesized in order to optimize the system. The application
of our methodology to the carbonylation of organic molecules will
also be investigated. Owing to the toxicity and dangers associated
with pressurized CO gas cylinders, we anticipate that our methodology
has potential for safer transport and storage of small, known, quantities
of carbon monoxide.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The
preparations of the complexes [Ir(η5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene)(benzene-1,2-dithiolato)]
(1) and [Os(η6-p-cym)(1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecarborane-1,2-dithiolato)] (2) were
based on previous reports.29,30 Anhydrous quality THF,
diethyl ether, and methanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. o-Carborane was purchased from Katchem and used as received.

CO is a Toxic Gas
All experiments involving the use
of CO were conducted in a fumehood, with researchers having portable
CO detectors with them at all times.

Instrumentation
UV–visible absorption spectra
were recorded using a Varian CARY 50 Bio UV–visible spectrophotometer
at 298 K using 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes. All infra-red spectra
were recorded on a Bruker Alpha Platinum ATR. All NMR spectra were
recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker Spectrospin spectrometer using deuterated
solvents. Chemical shifts are reported as δ in parts per million
using the residual protonated solvent as internal standard.31

Synthesis and Characterization
Coordination
of 1 with CO in Solution
Complex 1 was dissolved in the solvent of choice. A
needle connected to the CO cylinder by some Tygon tubing was then
purged by flushing some CO through. After 2 min of purge, the needle
was introduced into the solution and CO(g) was bubbled
in the solution for 3 min. The solutions were then analyzed. For 1H NMR studies, complex 1 (0.9 mg, 2 μmol)
was dissolved in 2 mL of CDCl3 or deuterated THF to obtain
a 1 mmol/L concentration. For UV–visible studies, complex 1 (1.1 mg, 2.4 μmol) was dissolved in 23.52 mL of solvent
(THF or CH2Cl2) to obtain a 10–4 mol/L concentration.

Coordination of 1 with CO in
the Solid State
Complex 1 (2–3 mg) was
introduced in a vial
(15 mL). The vial was closed with a septum. A needle connected to
the vacuum was used to create a light vacuum in the vial (the septum
slightly shrunk). The CO tubing and the end needle were purged by
flushing some CO through for 2 min. The end needle was connected to
the vial, and CO(g) was introduced into the vial. At the
same time, an exit needle was connected to the vial to avoid any CO
excessive pressure. After 5 min of CO flow, the two needles were removed,
and the vial was left open close to 1 h before any analyses were conducted.

Carbonylation Reaction between [1-CO] and 2 with the Vial-In-A-Vial Strategy
Complex 1 (15.9 mg, 34.0 μmol) was dissolved in THF (9 mL) in
a 20 mL scintillation vial. CO was bubbled in the solution for 3 min.
A change of color from deep red to red-orange was observed. The CO
needle was removed, and the vial was left open for 2 min to allow
CO(g) to be dispersed in the air.

Complex 2 (1 mg, 1.9 μmol) was dissolved in CDCl3 (1 mL)
in a 2 mL high-performance liquid chromatography vial equipped with
a stirrer bar. This small vial was introduced in the 20 mL scintillation
vial that was then closed with a standard plastic cap. The solution
in the small vial was stirred at 500 rpm. After 90 min, the solution
in the big vial was observed to be less intense in color. The small
vial was removed and its content was immediately analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
