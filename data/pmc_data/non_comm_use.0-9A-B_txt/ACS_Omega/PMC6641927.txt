A simple and cost-effective strategy
was rationally designed to
fabricate a special sandwich structure consisting of graphene, bilayer
silver, and a copper plate, which was used as a surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) substrate for highly efficient SERS sensing and
detection of trace molecules. Silver dendrite (AgD) nanostructures
were subsequently grown on a silver nanosphere (AgNS)/Cu surface to
form a bilayer silver/Cu structure, which showed a 1.5-fold Raman
enhancement compared to that of the AgNS/Cu substrate. After depositing
graphene on the bilayer silver/Cu substrate to obtain a sandwich structure,
a higher SERS enhancement and better durability were enabled. The
SERS performances, measured by a portable Raman instrument, showed
that the optimized sandwich structure substrate exhibited high SERS
sensitivity to crystal violet (CV) and rhodamine 6G (R6G) with low
limit of detection of 10–9 and 10–8 M, respectively. Such a sandwich-structured substrate exhibited
good reproducibility across the entire detection areas with an average
relative standard deviation less than 5.9%, which permits its reliable
quantitative detection of CV and R6G molecules. In addition, graphene
both effectively improved the SERS performances and protected Ag nanocrystals
from oxidation, which endowed the sandwich structure a long-term stability
with deviation of characteristic peaks’ intensity lower than
3.6% after 25 days. This study indicates that the graphene/bilayer
silver/Cu sandwich structure as a SERS substrate has a great potential
in detecting environmental pollutants.

1 Introduction
Trace-
and ultratrace-level analyses
of (bio)chemical molecules are relevant to several fields including
chemistry, environmental science, medicine, and bio-related systems.1−3 Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy,4 high-performance liquid chromatography,5 and immunoassays6 are general approaches
used for molecular detection. Although very effective and accurate,
they are time-consuming and costly. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) is an emerging and powerful tool for nondestructive identification
and sensing of molecular species owing to its extraordinary sensitivity
and selectivity reaching single to few molecules detection.7 More importantly, the Raman signal is free from
water interference and thus makes it suitable for the detection of
aqueous samples. It is reported that surface-enhanced Raman scattering
can enhance normal Raman signal up to 106–1012 times on the basis of the enhanced local electromagnetic
(EM) field near the noble-metal-nanostructured surfaces.8−11 Hence, molecular detection and sensing based on surface-enhanced
Raman scattering can be achieved using SERS active noble-metal micro/nanostructures
as plasmonic antennas to magnify the Raman signals.

When analyte
molecules are adsorbed on a roughened metal surface
(i.e., Pt, Ag, and Au nanoparticles (NPs)), it leads to strong Raman
enhancement of the analytes’ signals, which is caused by the
electromagnetic (EM) and the chemical effect.12 According to electromagnetic mechanism of SERS, the electromagnetic
“hot spot” occurs near the sharp tips and protrusions
and also forms at the smaller gaps in nanometer scale between metal
nanoparticles (NPs) and nanofilms. For example, Mihi and co-workers
fabricated a rough silver film showing the enhancement factors (EF)
for benzenethiol of 107 and 4-mercaptopyridine of 1010.13 Amanda J. Haes demonstrated
that rough Au nanostars showed an enhanced signal from electromagnetic
coupling between Au nanostars, and a low concentration of 100 nM for
uranyl was detected.14 MacFarlane et al.
reported a porous gold metamaterial that exhibited a joint EM field
enhancement resulting in a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 × 10–13 M and the coefficient of variation of 21%.15 Recent progress allows molecular detection using
the portable Raman spectrophotometers for rapid and on-site detection.16,17 However, the SERS substrates possessing both high detection sensibility
and high reproducibility remains a problem. Encouragingly, novel sandwich
configurations have been demonstrated to help the production of even
higher enhancement by an order of 1011 due to the coupling
of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from the metal nanostructures
with uniform Raman signals. To date, many efforts have been made to
develop sandwiched SERS substrates to exploit the coupling of LSPR
either between two metal nanostructured thin film layers or one nanoparticle
and one metal film layer.18,19 Kuang et al. have fabricated
a sandwich structure of roughened Ag slice/target protein complexes/single
Ag nanoparticles for highly reproducible SERS analysis of β-carotenes
and found that the LOD is low to 1−5 μg Chl/mL.20 More recently, Wang et al. reported a flexible
sandwich structure consisting of PMMA, Ag nanoflowers, and monolayer
graphene for ultrasensitive, reproducible, and stable SERS detections
and showed that the LOD for rhodamine 6G is down to 10–14 M with relative standard deviation lower than 10%.21

Despite the superior enhancement ability of Ag-based
nanostructures,
the oxidation commonly occurs on the surface and is still unavoidable;
such SERS substrates have difficulties in maintaining their long-term
stability and reproducibility. In this regard, the graphene-decorated
noble-metal-nanostructured hybrid SERS substrates have drawn significant
attention because of the synergistic effect of noble-metal’s
high SERS activity and graphene’s intriguing Raman scattering
properties originating from its atomic thickness and unique electron,
phonon structures. Recent studies have proved the important roles
of graphene in these hybrid structures, including as an oxidation
preventer,22 fluorescence quencher,23 additional chemical enhancer,24 and molecule stabilizer and absorber.25 More importantly, graphene is cheap and has an abundant
material source, greatly improving its feasibility for practical applications.
Recently, various methods have been developed for the synthesis of
graphene. Among them, chemical vapor deposition26,27 has proven to be the most commonly used method for high-quality
graphene fabrication. Chemical reduction of graphite oxide (GO), however,
is one of the conventional methods for large-scale synthesis of graphene.28 In the process, GO is readily and efficiently
prepared by the Hummers method in the lab, followed by the reduction
with a reducer.29

By combining the
superior plasmonic properties of silver with the
advantages of graphene, we demonstrated a sandwich-structured SERS
substrate consisting of graphene/AgD/AgNS/Cu fabricated by a facile,
cost-effective, and practicable synthetic strategy. The fabrication
process mainly consists of three steps, as shown in Figure 1. The sandwich structure exhibited
an improved Raman intensity of 2.3-fold compared to that of the AgNS/Cu
substrate, and the LODs for CV and R6G molecules are 10–9 and 10–8 M, respectively. In addition, remarkable
SERS reproducibility with the standard variation of 5.865% was exhibited
by the sandwich structure. An improved SERS signal long-term stability
was achieved by coating a graphene layer.

silver/Cu sandwich structure.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphologies
and Microstructures of the Products
The actual typical scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of
the products fabricated at different steps are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a displays that uniform Ag nanospheres with
a rough surface structure and a diameter of about 200 nm are prepared
on the Cu plate. Figure 2b presents the image of AgD/AgNS on a Cu plate, in which a layer
of hierarchical dendritic Ag nanocrystals with trunk diameter ranging
from 70 to 90 nm is synthesized on the surface of a AgNS/Cu plate.
GO-coated samples are shown in Figure 2c, indicating the sandwich structure of GO/bilayer
silver/Cu. Figure 2d–h shows a magnified image of graphene/AgD/AgNS/Cu and corresponding
Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images. It
is clear that GO and graphene films on the Cu support have flakelike
forms of different sizes and their size is usually more than 2 μm.
EDS mapping analysis displays the uniform distribution of three typical
elements of C, Ag, and Cu. Additionally, Raman spectra of the products
shown in Figure 2c,d
were recorded to illustrate the transformation from GO to graphene.
The Raman spectra (Figure S1) show D peak
of 1352 cm–1 and G peak of 1591 cm–1, confirming the existence of GO in a GO/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich
structure.30 From the analysis of the graphene
spectra, we suppose that the GO-coated sample has been reduced to
graphene in the sandwich structure.31

2.2 Formation
Process of the Graphene/Bilayer
Silver/Cu Sandwich Structure
The fabrication of the graphene/AgD/AgNS/Cu
sandwich structure involves three main steps: preparation of AgNS
on a Cu plate, depositing AgD onto the AgNS/Cu substrate to form a
bilayer silver/Cu structure, and coating graphene onto the surface
of the AgD/AgNS/Cu substrate to construct a sandwich structure. In
the present synthesis system, potassium biphthalate played a crucial
role in the preparation of the bilayer silver structure on Cu plates.
The products were only Ag dendritic nanostructures on a Cu plate in
the absence of potassium biphthalate (Figure S2). It is also important to first mix AgNO3 with potassium
biphthalate in an aqueous solution for 10 min, which allows the coordination
reaction between AgNO3 and potassium biphthalate to form
a coordination compound precursor. We conducted time-dependent experiments
at varying stages to reveal the morphology evolution in the formation
of the bilayer Ag on a Cu plate. First, when a Cu plate was put into
the above mixture solution, it rapidly reacted with the free Ag ions
by a galvanic replacement reaction32 and
tiny Ag nanoparticles were immediately formed on the Cu plate. The
Ag nanoparticles gradually grew up until the free Ag ions were exhausted
for 4 min (Figures S3 and 3a), and they grew into rough Ag nanospheres with particle
size increased to 200 nm (Figure 2a) Then, the coordination compound precursor of Ag
ions began to react with the Cu plate, and it produced dendritic Ag
nanostructures on the AgNS/Cu substrate to form a bilayer silver/Cu
structure (Figure 3b). Further prolonging time resulted in large quantity of Ag dendritic
structures, as shown in Figure 3c–f. The evolutionary process could also be characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. XRD patterns (Figure S4) of the samples prepared at different stages showed
that the weak Ag diffraction peak of (111) appeared for 3 min, which
confirmed that AgNS was initially formed on the Cu substrate surface.
It was found that the diffraction peak intensity of Ag increased with
the increasing reaction time, accompanied with the decrease in the
intensity of Cu plate diffraction peaks. It indicated that more AgD
structure was deposited on the AgNS/Cu substrate. It must be noted
that potassium biphthalate served as an important structure-director
for the construction of bilayer silver/Cu structures.

Figure 3 SEM images of a Ag/Cu
substrate fabricated at different reaction
times (a) 3 min, (b) 5 min, (c) 6 min, (d) 8 min, (e) 10 min, and
(f) 15 min.

In addition, the effect
of different molar ratios of AgNO3 to potassium biphthalate
on the morphology of bilayer silver/Cu
substrates was also investigated (Figure S5). Tuning the molar ratio from 2:1 to 16:1 always resulted in a bilayer
silver/Cu structure. However, the sizes and contents of AgD and AgNS
varied with the molar ratio. For example, large-sized AgD on the Cu
plate surface was obtained at a low molar ratio (2:1) of AgNO3 to potassium biphthalate (Figure S5a). With the increasing molar ratio, the size of AgD became smaller.
Meanwhile, a large quantity of AgNS was formed on the surface of the
Cu plate. At molar ratio of 18:1, more Cu reacted with free Ag ions,
resulting in some microholes on the Cu plate. Thus, an appropriate
molar ratio of 4:1 was proposed to obtain bilayer silver/Cu substrates.

To further enhance the SERS sensitivity and the long-term stability
of the bilayer silver/Cu substrates, a designed sandwich structure
was constructed by depositing a layer of GO on the surface of bilayer
silver/Cu via an electrodeposition method. Electrodeposition represents
a faster and more effective method for depositing GO on the substrates. Figure 4 shows the SEM images
of GO-coated bilayer silver/Cu substrates fabricated at different
coating times of GO. When it was deposited for 6 min, a thin GO flake
was sparsely deposited on the substrate surface (Figure 4a). For 10 min, the surface
of the substrate was well coated by a GO film, forming a relative
flat surface (Figure 4c). When the coating time was increased to 12 min or more, it was
completely coated by GO and a thick GO film was obtained (Figure 4e,f). In addition,
it was found that the GO concentrations also influence the coverage
and thickness of the GO film on the substrates, as shown in Figure S6. GO concentration of 5 mg L–1 was selected for the coating process. Finally, a GO/bilayer silver/Cu
sandwich structure prepared by the optimizing conditions was further
reduced by ascorbic acid in-site to transform GO to graphene. The
resultant graphene/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich structure was obtained
and served as a SERS substrate.

substrate prepared
at different coating times (a) 6 min, (b) 8 min, (c) 10 min, (d) 12
min, (e) 14 min, and (f) 16 min.

2.3 SERS Sensitivity of the Samples
As
expected, we found that different structures of monolayer AgNS/Cu,
bilayer AgD/AgNS/Cu, and sandwich-structured graphene/bilayer silver/Cu
could exhibit varying degrees of SERS sensitivities. Thereby, we first
examined their SERS performances using CV as probing Raman molecules.
These structures as SERS substrates could be easily identified by
CV molecules using a portable Raman spectrometer. SERS spectra of
CV adsorbed on monolayer AgNS/Cu substrates are shown in Figure 5a. All of the Raman
peaks could be ascribed to the different vibrating modes of CV, as
we reported in the previous work.33,34 We found that
monolayer AgNS on Cu prepared at 3 min had the lowest SERS intensity
as only Ag nanospheres were formed on the surface of the Cu plate.
An enhanced SERS signal was observed when Ag dendrites were formed
and deposited on the Cu plate at 5 min, and it reached a maximal value
for 6 min because of the strong electromagnetic coupling between AgNS
and Ag dendrites. However, a further increase of reaction time resulted
in a reduction of SERS signal. It could be explained by the fact that
the number of Ag dendrites increased with prolonging time, which shielded
the hot spots and reduced the local electromagnetic fields and consequently
the Raman signal. Subsequently, we compared the SERS sensitivity of
bilayer AgD/AgNS/Cu synthesized at molar ratios of AgNO3 to potassium biphthalate ranging from 2:1 to 16:1 (Figure 5b). It was found that the molar
ratio of the reactants contributes equally to the enhancement of SERS.
The optimal molar ratio of AgNO3 to potassium biphthalate
was 4:1. Moreover, we observed that the initial GO concentrations
and coating times also affected the SERS performance of the final
sandwich structure of graphene/bilayer silver/Cu. By optimizing the
experimental parameters, we concluded that the optimal conditions
for the preparation of graphene/bilayer silver/Cu substrates were
GO concentrations of 5 mg L–1 and a coating time
of 10 min (Figure 5c,d).

Figure 5 SERS spectra of AgD/AgNP/Cu substrates prepared at different reaction
times (a) and molar ratio of AgNO3 to potassium biphthalate
(b). SERS spectra of graphene/AgD/AgNP/Cu substrates prepared at different
GO concentrations (c) and GO electrodeposition times (d). All of the
substrates were immersed in CV molecules of 10–6 M for 12 h and dried for SERS detection.

We estimated the enhancement factor (EF) of AgNS/Cu, AgD/AgNS/Cu,
and graphene/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich structure to CV as probing
molecules by the strong band of 1174 cm–1 using
the following standard equation35  where ISERS and Ibulk are the intensities of C–H in-plane
bending vibrations at 1174 cm–1 in the presence
of AgNS/Cu, AgD/AgNS/Cu, and graphene/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich structures
and in the absence of metal nanoparticles, respectively (Figure 6). NSERS and Nbulk represent the
numbers of CV molecules in the SERS sample (10–5 M) and in the ethanol solution (0.1 M), which were effectively excited
by a laser beam. Accordingly, the EF of a AgNS/Cu substrate is 5.37
× 104 and the EFs of AgD/AgNS/Cu and graphene/bilayer
silver/Cu sandwich structures are 8.04 × 104 and 1.19
× 105, respectively. The enhancement factor calculation
process can be found in the Supporting Information. Owing to the formation of a bilayer silver structure in AgD/AgNS/Cu,
the EF of the bilayer silver/Cu substrate shows 1.5-fold improvement
compared to that of our AgNS/Cu substrate and the enhancement ability
is better than that of the reported AgD/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
composite with EF of 5 × 104.36 As expected, the graphene/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich structure exhibits
much better SERS signal and shows 1.48-fold enhancement than that
of a bilayer silver/Cu substrate, which is probably due to more hot
spots offered by graphene wrinkles and the improvement of electromagnetic
field.25,37 By comparison, the SERS EF of our graphene/bilayer
silver/Cu sandwich is greater than that of Cu/AgD@G, for which the
EF value was estimated to be 3.7 × 105.38 The similar synergistic enhancement effect of
graphene and metal nanostructures is observed in the graphene/Au NPs,39 graphene/Ag/Si,40 and graphene/Au or Ag NPs substrates.41

substrates, and Raman spectra of bulk CV solution of 0.1 M.

2.4 Uniformity
and Long-Term Stability of a Graphene/Bilayer
Silver/Cu Sandwich Structure Substrate
The uniformity of
SERS signal for a sandwich structure substrate was assessed by comparing
SERS spectra of CV at 60 different spots on one substrate (Figure 7a). The standard
variation for the vibrations of 1174 cm–1 is 5.865%,
as shown in Figure 7b, exhibiting remarkable SERS reproducibility. Indeed, the signal
spatial uniformity of graphene/bilayer silver/Cu may rival that of
the GO/AgD/Cu substrates whose intensity deviation is less than 6%
for 20 spots32 and will probably be more
competitive than that of other AgD-based nanostructures. The excellent
SERS signal uniformity is crucial for the following quantitative analysis
of the model target analyte molecules with high reproducibility.

Figure 7 (a) SERS
spectra of CV molecules measured on 60 spots of the sandwich
structure and (b) comparison of the SERS intensity at 174 cm–1 peak for CV.

Then, the ultratrace
detection abilities of the optimal sandwich
structure were tested by a portable Raman spectrometer. Figure 8a shows the SERS spectra of
five different concentrations of CV molecules. From this figure, it
is clear that the limit of detection value was as low as 10–9 M, indicating that this sandwich structure as a SERS active substrate
was sensitive enough. A nearly linear relationship between the Raman
intensity and the CV concentrations was obtained in the range of 10–6–10–9 M with R2 value of 0.935 (Figure 8b). To explore the potential detection diversity of
this kind of SERS substrate, we examined its analytical performance
for R6G molecules. The SERS spectra of R6G with five different concentrations
ranging from 10–4 to 10–8 M are
shown in Figure 8c.
The characteristic Raman peaks of R6G appeared and could be assigned
to different vibration modes.42,43 It showed that the
lowest probed concentration for R6G was 10–8 M,
and a broad linear fit between the intensity of SERS band at 1509
cm–1 and R6G concentration with R2 value of 0.974 was obtained (Figure 8d). The result clearly demonstrated that
the synthesized sandwich structure could be employed to reliably quantitatively
detect these concentrations of CV and R6G.

and (c) R6G with five different concentrations;
linear fit between the SERS intensity and target molecules concentration
(b) CV and (d) R6G.

Besides acting as a SERS
enhancer of graphene, it also acts as
a protective layer to prevent it from oxidation in air, thus maintaining
good long-term stability of the graphene/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich
structure. We therefore examined the SERS signals of the fresh samples
of the bilayer silver/Cu substrate and the graphene-modified bilayer
silver/Cu substrate and their corresponding samples stored for 25
days. The SERS spectra are shown in Figure 9, which demonstrated their differences in
signal intensity. Overall, the SERS signal intensity decreased to
some extent after 25 days because of the loss of SERS activity. For
the bilayer silver/Cu substrate (Figure 9b), the SERS signal intensity decreased from
3518 to 3006 at a peak of 725 cm–1 (about 15% loss),
from 15581 to 12835 at a peak of 1174 cm–1 (about
18% loss), and from 5726 to 4839 at a peak of 1587 cm–1 (about 15% loss). For the graphene-modified bilayer silver/Cu sandwich
structure (Figure 9c), it still maintained a good SERS signal even when it was exposed
to air for 25 days. Only signal intensity of about 6, 4, and 9% at
725, 1174, and 1587 cm–1 were lost, indicating the
important role of graphene in improving the long-term stability of
the substrates. The stability of our prepared graphene-modified bilayer
silver/Cu sandwich structure is comparable to that of the rGO and
gold NPs film covered silver dendrites report by Liu et al., whose
SERS intensity decreases by about 10.6% after 50 days.44

days of the bilayer silver/Cu substrate and graphene/bilayer silver/Cu
substrate. (b, c) Comparison of SERS signal intensity at peaks of
725, 1174, and 1587 cm–1 of two sets of substrates.

2.5 Practical
Detection of Real Samples of the
Graphene/Bilayer Silver/Cu Substrate
Owing to the high signal
reproducibility and good stability of the graphene/bilayer silver/Cu
substrate, it is of great potential to detect practical samples in
the real world. As it is known that CV not only acts as an SERS probing
molecule but also is a banned drug of aquaculture, therefore we selected
fish as a real sample model to conduct the analysis of real samples
for the detection of trace molecules. Several clean and fresh fish
was sprayed with different concentrations of CV and kept alive for
a period of 6 days under the natural conditions. Before SERS detection,
the fish scales were scraped, washed with ethanol and water, and air-dried.
Then, we used the substrate to scrub the CV molecules off the fish
scales, followed by SERS detection by a portable Raman spectroscope. Figure 10 displays the SERS
spectra of CV detected on fish scales with different spraying concentrations.
It is clear that a low concentration of 10–7 M still
can be detected by the graphene/bilayer silver/Cu substrate. Besides,
no SERS interfering signal from fish scales was detected. The results
indicate that the SERS-based detection opens new avenues for rapid
and high sensitive analysis of trace molecules in real samples.

concentrations using the graphene/bilayer silver/Cu substrate.

3 Conclusions
A unique sandwich structure based on bilayer silver for the sensitive
and quantitative detection of ultratrace analytes using SERS technology
was designed and implemented. The sandwich structure consisted of
graphene, a bilayer silver nanostructure, and a copper plate. The
SERS sensitivity of the sandwich structure could be optimized by tuning
the reaction time, molar ratio of AgNO3 to potassium biphthalate,
GO concentrations, and electrodeposition time. The SERS properties
of the samples were measured by a portable Raman instrument, and the
results showed that the bilayer silver/Cu substrate exhibited a 1.5-fold
enhancement compared to the AgNS/Cu substrate. As expected, the graphene/bilayer
silver/Cu sandwich structure exhibited the highest SERS signal and
shows 2.3-fold enhancement than that of AgNS/Cu substrate. The optimal
SERS sandwich structure substrates showed the LOD of 10–9 and 10–8 M for CV and R6G, respectively. The most
important observation is that graphene/bilayer silver/Cu demonstrated
excellent signal uniformity with the standard variation of 5.865%.
Furthermore, it still maintained a good SERS activity after being
exposed to air for 25 days. It also showed great potentials in trace
detection of real samples. Coupled with the signal uniformity and
the long-term stability, our graphene/bilayer silver/Cu substrates
are expected to find broad practical applications in outdoor rapid
quantitative analysis of chemicals and hazardous pollutants.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of AgD/AgNS on
a Cu Plate
Copper (Cu) plate is chosen as an attractive SERS
substrate because
it is cheap and more effectively couples with silver.45 The Cu plate was first cut into pieces of 1.5 cm ×
1.5 cm and cleaned for further use. Then, the Cu plate was immersed
into a mixed aqueous solution (20 mL) of AgNO3 (0.5625
mmol) and potassium biphthalate (0.1406 mmol) for different periods
of time (3–15 min). Uniformly distributed Ag nanospheres (AgNS)
were initially formed on the Cu plate by a galvanic replacement reaction.
Then, Ag dendrites (AgD) were grown on the surface of AgNS to form
a bilayer structure. The obtained bilayer silver on the Cu plate was
cleaned and dried under N2 gas flow.

4.2 Synthesis of a Graphene/Bilayer Silver/Cu
Sandwich Structure
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by
the modified Hummers method.46 GO-diluted
solution with concentration of 5 mg L–1 was obtained
by dispersing original GO solution into water and ultrasonicating
for 60 min. The above samples were decorated with GO to form a sandwich
structure via an electrodeposition method. Briefly, a clean platinum
plate was used as a negative electrode and a bilayer silver/Cu plate
was used as a positive electrode. The two electrodes was fixed and
kept at a distance of about 20 mm from each other. When the voltage
(30 V) was applied, the negatively charged GO nanoflakes moved to
the negative electrode and then deposited on the surface to form a
GO/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich structure. Finally, GO was further in-site
reduced by ascorbic acid (30 mL, 5.68 mM) to transform GO to graphene,
and a graphene/bilayer silver/Cu sandwich structure was obtained and
used for SERS substrates.

4.3 Characterization and SERS
Measurements of
the Products
We used a rotating-anode X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku D/Max-γA) to characterize the phase and composition
of the products. The morphologies were observed by a scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
equipped on a field-emission SEM (JEOL-JSM-6700F) was used to measure
the elemental mapping images. The SERS spectra were recorded by a
portable Raman instrument (i-Raman plus, B&W Tek Inc.). For SERS
measurements, the SERS substrates were put into different concentrations
of analyte solutions with total volumes of 200 μL for a period
of 12 h. Then, the substrates were taken out, washed with ethanol
and water, and dried for the subsequent Raman measurements. During
SERS measurements, a 20× objective in a microscope was used.
A 785 nm laser wavelength was selected for excitation, and the total
accumulation time was 2 s.
