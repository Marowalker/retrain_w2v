Urine
strips are widely applied for rapid analysis of various indexes
of urine for clinical examinations. The tests mainly rely on the application
of a urine analyzer, which suffers several drawbacks and cannot meet
the requirements of point-of-care testing (POCT). The integration
of a smartphone with a biosensor has recently attracted great attention.
We herein propose a human vision-based smartphone algorithm for colorimetric
analysis of various urine indexes. A CIEDE2000 formula in CIELab color
space is applied for the evaluation of color difference, which may
greatly improve the analytical performances of urine strips. The proposed
algorithm also possesses merits such as good accuracy, quantitative
analysis, and limited calculation task, which is suitable for the
application with smartphone platform. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method shows excellent reliability compared with
the urine analyzer and some other algorithms. In addition, human real
samples are successfully analyzed with excellent accuracy. Therefore,
this work provides a convenient colorimetric tool for POCT urine analysis.

Introduction
The advent of the Internet
era brings new life styles for people.
In healthcare aspect, the concept of point-of-care testing (POCT)
is becoming more and more popular.1,2 Although instruments
in hospital or central laboratory provide extremely high analytical
precision, they suffer disadvantages such as high cost, cumbersome
registration, long-time consumption, and so on. On the other hand,
POCT refers to the point in time when people are served by certain
healthcare products.3 Generally, a series
of biochemical, blood, or molecular diagnostic tests are performed
rapidly without professional medical personnels and specific places.
The attractive features of POCT, including simple operation, ease
to carry, and rapid analysis with accurate results, conform to the
trend of the times.4 Smartphone accessories
equipped with operating systems have become revolutionary portable
diagnostic tools, which can be used to read colorimetric signals directly.5−7 The smartphone has rich sensors to detect signals, great processing
power and memory capacity to analyze and store diagnostic results,
high-resolution screen to display calculated results, and multiple
data transmission functions such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB. In addition,
the features of small size, low price, large user community, and high
programmability make it much suitable for POCT and mobile diagnostics.8,9 In the past few years, numerous smartphone-based medical testing
techniques emerge, which cover the fields of immunoassay,10,11 microscopy,12 flow cytometry,13 electrochemical,14 surface plasma resonance,15 and colorimetric
biosensors.16

Urine is one type of
waste products from the human body, which
contains important physiological and pathological information.17 Urinalysis is a common test for the diagnosis
of human diseases and disorders such as diabetes,18 urinary infection,19 and nephritis.20 Commercial urine strips are widely used in urine
analysis, and the detection mainly relies on the colorimetric changes
of corresponding blocks compared with a reference color chart. Usually,
a urine analyzer is used to read and analyze the color changes. Nevertheless,
it suffers several drawbacks and cannot meet the requirements of POCT.

In recent years, certain smartphone algorithms have been designed,
trying to replace the urine analyzer. Two strategies are usually exploited
to define and describe the color difference of urine strips. One is
based on machine learning, in which a lot of images are used as training
data and significant color features are then extracted.21 A model that distinguishes colors of urine strips
is finally achieved. However, the calculation task of this strategy
is heavy, which is a burden for the processor of a smartphone. In
addition, only semiquantitative results can be obtained. The other
strategy involves color space transformation. Color space is a set
of definitions and rules used to accurately calibrate and generate
various colors, which can be reflected as a mathematical model with
a set of values. Color difference is usually described by the distance
between two points in color space. Images taken by camera are represented
in the RGB space. However, it is a nonuniform color space. The distance
between two colors cannot represent the color sense of human vision.
Therefore, it is necessary to be converted to another uniform color
space. In 1931, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE)
established the CIE 1931 color space, which is defined by two coordinates
that define chromaticity.22 The degree
of color difference can be described according to the distance of
each color in the plane.23 Later, CIE introduced
CIE 1976, which is the most suitable color space for human vision
so far. However, most of the currently developed algorithms do not
conform to human vision; thus, the accuracy is always not satisfactory
compared with the urine analyzer.

In this report, we have developed
a color space transformation-based
smartphone algorithm and fabricated a novel colorimetric method for
the analysis of urine (Scheme 1). The camera on the smartphone is employed to capture images
of reacted urine strips. A colorimetric algorithm with light calculation
task is then proposed for quantitative or semiquantitative analysis
of various analytes in the urine. Color space transformation from
RGB to CIELab is successfully achieved, and the accuracy is promised.
This proposed method successfully meets the requirements of low-cost,
limited technical support, fast response, and excellent accuracy,
which may have great potential utility in the future.

Scheme 1 Illustration
of the Process of the Proposed Colorimetric Urinalysis
Results and Discussion
In CIELab
spectra, color could be described by the coordinates
of L*, a*, and b*, in which L* stands for the luminance, whereas a* and b* represent the changes of color
from red to green and yellow to blue, respectively (Figure S2). In CIELab spectra, changes of color and brightness
are observed uniformly by human eyes from left to right, which are
superior than those of RGB spectra (Figure S3). As a result, we have chosen CIELab to define the degree of color
similarity and developed a novel colorimetric urinalysis method. CIEDE2000
is the most accurate color difference formula and is constituent with
human vision, compared with previous CIE76 and CIE94.24,25 Although the complexity of the formula is increased with a number
of intermediate parameters, the performance of color difference prediction
is not affected with the current processor.

After color space
transformation from RGB to CIELab and color difference
calculation, URIT 11A strips are employed and tested to evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm. URIT 11A strips contain a blank
block for urine analyzer correction and 11 testing blocks for the
analysis of pH value, nitrite, glucose, ascorbate, specific gravity,
blood, protein, bilirubin, urobilinogen, ketone, and leukocytes. Each
testing block is immobilized with corresponding reagents. After dipping
urine samples on them, specific reactions occur and the color changes
could be used to represent the level of each index after comparing
with the standard color card (Figure S4). MATLAB is then used to calculate the values of corresponding indexes
according to the proposed algorithm, which are compared with those
measured by the urine analyzer.

For the samples of UQ-11 control
solutions, the concentration of
a certain analyte with high concentration is defined as Ch, and the concentration of N-fold diluent
is Ctest, which satisfies the following
relationship  

Because of the uncertainty of the value
of Ch, we analyze the relationship between Ctest and dilution ratio of N after the following
transformation  

The UQ-11 control solutions are diluted with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12,
14, 16, 18, and 20 times, which are analyzed by the proposed method
and a urine analyzer. As shown in Figure 1, the histograms represent semiquantitative
results by the urine analyzer and the scatter diagrams show the results
calculated by the colorimetric algorithm. Taken glucose, ascorbic,
blood, and ketone as examples, the excellent agreements demonstrate
that the algorithm is highly suitable for the analysis of urine strips.
In addition, the insets reflect the relationship between calculated
values and the logarithmic diluted times, most of which show linear
relationships and meet the expectations. We have also tested the other
six indexes (Figure S5). The fine results
promise the potential of the method for quantitative analysis.

Figure 1 Comparison
of the results of proposed colorimetric urinalysis (experimental
group) and commercial urine analyzer (control group) for the detection
of (a) glucose, (b) ascorbic, (c) blood, and (d) ketone.

The accuracy of the semiquantitative analysis by
the proposed algorithm
is further confirmed. The semiquantitative results for the analysis
of 10 indexes (each three times) achieved by the proposed method and
urine analyzer are compared (Figure 2). The numbers of coincident results take up about
85% of all detections and the erroneous judgements adjacent to the
standard results without significant deviations.

Figure 2 Accuracy evaluation of
the proposed method.

The pH value of the standard positive urine is faintly acid.
Therefore,
the color of the alkaline reaction cannot be obtained. Because the
preparation of gradient acid and alkali solutions and the determination
of pH values are quite easy, we have prepared the samples with different
pH values to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on pH sensing.
As shown in Figure 3, the pH values of the reference color card are from 5 to 9. However,
the range can be extended from 4.5 to 9.5 based on the novel algorithm.
The results are in good accordance with the theoretical expectation.
The fitting curve obtained by this algorithm is much close to that
of control method, which confirms the high accuracy of the method.
All of these results show high stability of the algorithm, which is
applicable to the colorimetric analysis of the urine strips.

Figure 3 Comparison
of the calculated pH values and standard values.

To verify the practical utility of the proposed method, we
have
employed 25 real samples (urina sanguinis samples) for analysis, which
are collected from local hospitals. The color difference between samples
collected from different patients is mainly determined by their contents.
The detected results can be used to reflect the information successfully.
In addition, the urine sample storage mode, storage time, and test
strip conditions may also influence the sample color, which should
be uniformedly controlled before measurement. These samples are measured
by a Urit 180 type urine analyzer as the gold standard. In addition,
the images captured by the smartphone are analyzed by the proposed
algorithm and three other algorithms, which are based on RGB, CIE
XYZ, and HSV color spaces, respectively. Detailed results and three
exemplary images are shown in Tables S1–S5 and Figure S6. The accuracies are listed
in Table 1. The numbers
reflect the degree of coincidence compared with the gold standard.
The first method using RGB angle is relatively inferior, which is
due to the fact that the RGB color space is not uniform; meanwhile,
the angle parameter is not sensitive to the color difference. The
accuracies of the other three methods perform well, and the proposed
algorithm shows the best accuracy. Although both of CIEDE2000 and
CIE XYZ are based on CIELab color space, CIEDE2000 formula have many
improvements. For example, a hue term (RT) is added to deal with the problematic blue region for better perceptual
uniformity. Compensations are also involved for neutral colors, lightness,
chroma, and hue. Therefore, the accuracy of color difference calculation
is improved, and CIEDE2000 is much suitable for colorimetric analysis
of urine test strips.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
proposed a smartphone algorithm for colorimetric
analysis of urine strips. An optimized color space transformation
strategy is designed based on human vision. Original RGB color space
is converted to CIELab color space, which only requires small computational
capacity. The detected results show that the method is highly accurate
for quantitative or semiquantitative analysis of each index in the
urine strips. Thus, it is suitable for the application of smartphone
platform. The developed method has a wide application prospect in
urinalysis and facilitates the assessment of personal clinical status,
which is expected to replace the traditional urine analyzer. In addition,
this algorithm can also be adjusted to detect other samples and analytes,
which result in color differences with different concentrations, such
as blood hematocrit, vitamin D, chlorine level in water, cholesterol,
and so on.

Methods
Materials and Instruments
URIT 11A
strips and UQ-11
control solutions were obtained from URIT Medical Electronic Group
Co., Ltd (Guilin, China). Each control solution contained corresponding
contents with different concentrations. The lower concentration was
called a negative quality control, and the higher was called a positive
quality control (Table S6). Human urine
samples were from The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University
with the informed consent of the donors (Suzhou, China). The first
urine samples after getting up in the morning were collected with
the urine sampling tubes. All experiments using the samples were performed
in accordance with institutional and national guidelines and with
the approval of the Medical Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated
Hospital of Soochow University (no. 2012076). The study was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A Nubia Z9 mini smartphone
with 16 megapixel HD camera and eight-core CPU was employed. In order
to ensure illumination uniformity and remove any influence of external
environment, an experimental box was designed and used for photographing,
in which a white light source composed of six groups of LED was integrated
(Figure S1).

Color Space Transformation
Original RGB color space
was converted to CIELab color space which was the best matching for
human vision. First, RGB was transformed to XYZ, which was then further
transformed to CIELab. The original image was assumed as (R, G, B).
The nonlinear sRGB was treated by inverse gamma correction:      in which  

Next, XYZ was converted
using the following
equations    Xn, Yn, and Zn were the three
stimulus values, which
were 95.047, 100.0, and 108.883, respectively. The RGB values of each
blocks could be converted to CIELab values and were then stored in
MATLAB color library.

Calculation of Color Difference
The color difference
ΔE00 between two color blocks, (L1*, a1*, b1*) and (L2*, a2*, b2*), was calculated
using the formula of CIEDE2000. The three parameters of kL, kC, and kH equaled to 1. The calculations could be performed as
follows.28                                          

Quantitative Analysis
The content of a certain analyte
in the urine strips contained five reference color blocks from low
to high. According to the previous formulas, the closest reference
color blocks could be found and the approximations were measured based
on the image processing method. The color differences between test
block and two closest color blocks were assumed to be ΔE1 and ΔE2.
The corresponding concentrations of the two color blocks were assumed
to be C1 and C2. Therefore, the concentration of the test block could be calculated
according to the ratio of the two color differences.  

Considering that the two endpoint color
blocks represented the minimum value Cmin and maximum value Cmax measured by the
urine strips, the final obtained results should be between these two
values.  

Comparison of Experimental Groups and Control
Groups
Two kinds of testing samples were prepared. One was
positive quality
control solutions diluted by negative quality controls with a series
of ratios. The other solutions with different pH values were adjusted
by HCl and NaOH (pH from 4.5 to 9.5). Samples (20 μL) were added
to the test block and blank block of the urine strips, which could
be absorbed. The strips were placed in the experimental box. After
59 s, the photograph of the strips was taken by the smartphone camera.
For control experiments, the strips were loaded on the urine analyzer
for measurements.
