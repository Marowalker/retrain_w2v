Graphitic nanoparticles,
specifically, graphene oxide (GO) nanoflakes,
are of major interest in the field of nanotechnology, with potential
applications ranging from drug delivery systems to energy storage
devices. These applications are possible largely because of the properties
imparted by various functional groups attached to the GO surface by
relatively simple production methods compared to pristine graphene.
We investigated how varying the size and oxidation of GO flakes can
affect their structural and dynamic properties in an aqueous solution.
The all-atom modeling of the GO nanoflakes of different sizes suggested
that the curvature and roughness of relatively small (3 × 3 nm)
GO flakes are not affected by their degree of oxidation. However,
the larger (7 × 7 nm) flakes exhibited an increase in surface
roughness as their oxidation increased. The analysis of water structure
around the graphitic nanoparticles revealed that the degree of oxidation
does not affect the water dipole orientations past the first hydration
layer. Nevertheless, oxygen functionalization induced a well-structured
first hydration layer, which manifested in identifiable hydrophobic
and hydrophilic patches on GO. The detailed all-atom models of GO
nanoflakes will guide a rational design of functional graphitic nanoparticles
for biomedical and industrial applications.

1 Introduction
Graphitic
nanomaterials have been a highly topical area of research
in the past decade, with an array of possible applications ranging
from drug delivery to biosensing and prevention of biofouling.1,2 In recent years, graphene oxide (GO), the surface-functionalized
cousin of pristine graphene (PG), has become widely recognized as
the more accessible nanomaterial relative to PG. GO is chemically
synthesized using Hummer’s method,3 which was refined by Lerf and Klinowski et al.,4 where a mixture of KMnO4 and concentrated H2SO4 is reacted with graphite to produce GO with
the chemical composition of C10O1(OH)1(COOH)0.5. The distribution of functional groups comprises
two epoxy groups, two hydroxyl groups on both sides of the basal plane,
and one carboxyl group on the edge for every 20 carbon atoms. This
chemical structure allows GO flakes to be easily synthesized, transported,
and handled, relative to native PG flakes. Graphene can also be functionalized
with various types of functional groups other than oxygen through
both covalent and noncovalent modifications.5 Because of the presence of the large and highly functionalized surface,
GO allows for noncovalent interactions with biological molecules via
electrostatics, π–π stacking, and hydrogen bonding.
This functionalization also contributes to the desirable optical,
mechanical, and electrical properties2 of
GO, which are exploited in biomedical applications, for example, biosensors
for the detection of biomolecules with high sensitivity and selectivity,2,6 enzyme inhibitors, and drug delivery vehicles.2,6−9 More recently, several studies identified the potential of these
nanoparticles to mediate the formation of amyloid protein fibrils,
known for their implications in debilitating neurodegenerative diseases.10−12 In this paper, we explore the structural modeling of the GO nanoflakes
for subsequent applications in controlling the amyloid fibril formation.

Computational modeling provides direct access to the structural
characterization of nanomaterials complementary to experiments.13,14 Several computational studies focused on the structure of GO nanoparticles,
mostly with the aim of improving the mechanical properties of this
nanomaterial.15−17 In particular, Khoei et al. demonstrated that increasing
the proportion of the oxygen-containing functional groups also increased
the C–C bond length of the hexagonal lattices of graphene,
causing a distortion in the hexagonal lattice.15 This resulted in the alteration of the mechanical properties
of the material such as shear modulus and elastic constants. Wei et
al. modeled the wetting properties of GO relative to PG and found
that the oxidized regions contributed to the spreading of water droplets
across the surface.16 Controlling the proportion
of the oxygen functionality can thus be used for modulating the water
behavior on the GO surfaces. These studies suggest that the degree
of oxidation has a significant effect on the mechanical and wetting
properties of the graphitic flakes. In addition, several recent theoretical
studies investigated the behavior of GO sheets and GO nanoflakes in
the presence of biomolecules and solvents.7,18−25 These studies indicated that the highly functionalized GO interacted
most favorably with the biomolecules via hydrogen bonding, whereas
the GO with low oxygen functional group densities prevalently interacted
through π–π stacking.16,17 The theoretical studies utilized various modeling approaches to
simulate the bonded and nonbonded interatomic interactions of GO.
The most common approach for modeling GO7,16,19,22,24 is to use the LJ sp2 carbon potentials from AMBER96, the bond angle
parameters from CHARMM27,26 and all other
interaction parameters from the OPLS-AA force field.27 Although this approach may be adequate to model simple
homogeneous systems, it has not been validated for modeling GO interactions
with biomolecules. In addition, the CHARMM force field was used more
recently by Bansal et al. for the modeling of aqueous GO dispersion.28 This study concluded that the functional groups
on the GO surfaces prevented the GO aggregation in water through strong
repulsive forces, which were shown to increase with an increasing
concentration of functional groups. The analysis of hydrogen bonding
data also indicated that both epoxy- and hydroxyl-functionalized GO
surfaces were stabilized via the intra- and interlayer water-mediated
H-bonds.28 Similarly, Tang et al.18 highlighted that the type of functional group,
the oxygen content, and the initial distance between the GO flakes
all play a significant role in the aggregation kinetics of GO nanoparticles.

Alternatively, the GO–biomolecular complexes have been simulated
using material-orientated force fields such as COMPASS,17,29,30 originally developed for modeling
organic (polymer) interfaces with metal oxides. For example, Rahmani
et al. utilized the COMPASS II force field to model the adsorption
of various amino acids on GO surfaces.29 Their study concluded that the surface functionalization of GO disrupted
the π–π stacking between the surface and the aromatic
residues of the amino acids. Class II force fields are generally computationally
expensive, as the functional form of the Hamiltonian includes anharmonic
terms, such as quartic stretching and quartic angle bending as well
as a variety of other important intramolecular coupling interactions.31 However, COMPASS has undergone limited development
and testing for biomolecular systems, and, as a result, the computational
cost and biomolecular force field deficiencies do not generally justify
its application to sampling complex biological phenomena.

Unlike
PG, GO is highly soluble in water; thus, its influence on
the surrounding water structure is one of the important factors that
will ultimately control its interactions with biomolecules.32−35 As a result, it is important to understand the mechanisms of interactions
that govern the structure and dynamic behaviors of the GO nanoflakes
in an aqueous environment. Moreover, as demonstrated by previous studies10,11,20,36 the nanoparticle size, functionalization, and curvature play an
important role in the biomolecular recognition and protein adsorption
onto the surface of the nanoparticle. Despite the noteworthy research
efforts on GO, there is a gap in understanding the interconnection
between the size and the degree of oxidation of the GO nanoflakes
and their physical and (bio)chemical properties. To exploit the unique
properties of the GO particles in biomedicine, it is crucial to reveal
how these properties influence the GO interactions with the environment,
primarily the behavior of the surrounding solvent and biomolecules.
This paper reports a theoretical modeling investigation of the effects
of GO nanoflake size and degree of functionalization on the GO surface
structure, dynamics, and interactions in the aqueous solution relevant
to biological environments. The outcomes of this study provide the
atomistic insights needed for a rational design of novel graphitic
nanomaterials with a desired behavior and an optimized and controlled
function for biomedical applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Surface Roughness and Flexibility
of Graphitic
Nanoflakes
The shape and curvature of nanoparticles were
highlighted to be a major factor implicated in protein binding.36 The average surface roughness (or curvature)
of all the nine graphitic models is shown in Figure 1, indicating a general trend of the average
roughness increase with the increased size and degree of functionalization
of the graphitic flakes. For the 3 nm flakes, there was a small increase
(∼0.1 nm) in the surface roughness with increasing oxidation,
suggesting that the nanoparticles are too small for the functional
groups to induce the significant response in the curvature. By contrast,
the presence of oxygen-containing groups in the larger (5 and 7 nm)
rGO and GO flakes increased the curvature of the nanoparticle approximately
twofold, compared to PG of the same size. Moreover, the 5 nm flakes
of rGO and GO had a negligible difference (within the standard deviation)
in their surface roughness, indicating that the curvature in rGO is
largely induced by the edge functional groups. Overall, the 7 nm flakes
exhibited the most significant increase in surface roughness as the
degree of oxidation increased, with the PG measuring  roughness
of 0.9 ± 0.05 nm, and rGO and GO of 1.2 ± 0.07 nm and 1.6
± 0.13 nm, respectively.

Figure 1 Average roughness of graphitic nanoflakes as
a function of size
and degree of oxidation.

To understand the relationship between the measured surface
roughness
and the flexibility of the particle, the root-mean square fluctuation
(RMSF) of individual atoms in each graphitic flake was calculated
for the final 50 ns of the simulated trajectories. The average RMSF
values are presented in Figure 2, using the color scale ranging from 1 to 10. The blue-colored
areas indicate a high RMSF, whereas the red-colored areas indicate
low fluctuations. The ratio of the stiff (red) to mobile (blue) areas
is presented below each plot. For all the 3 nm flakes, high fluctuations
were observed at the corners of each flake, while the inner area of
the flakes remained stable or less dynamic. This indicates that the
minor variances in roughness between the 3 nm graphitic flakes are
mostly attributed to the edge fluctuations. The 3 nm rGO sheet has
significantly more stiff areas within the sheet as its stiff/mobile
area ratio is 1.1, compared to 0.53 and 0.43 in the PG and GO flakes,
respectively. This is likely due to the lack of edge functional groups
to induce higher fluctuations around the edges as observed in the
GO flakes, combined with the smaller size of the flake where oxidation
stabilized the inner areas.

Figure 2 Average fluctuations of individual atoms in
each graphitic nanoflake.
The color scale represents the normalized RMSF values. The numbers
below each plot indicate the ratio of stiff to mobile surface areas.

Increases in fluctuations were
also observed around the edges of
the 5 nm graphitic flakes, with reduced fluctuations around the center
of the flakes. Figure 2 shows that the introduction of functional groups reduces the flexibility
of the rings, evidenced by less fluctuations exhibited by the densely
functionalized areas. This oxidation-induced rigidity is the main
contributor to the variances in roughness seen between different flake
sizes. This effect was also observed by Khoei and Khorrami15 as discussed previously, where an increase in
oxidation agents in graphene sheets leads to decreased elastic constants.
The RMSF results for the 7 nm flakes revealed relatively larger areas
of low fluctuations manifesting in the overall reduced dynamics compared
to the smaller flakes. Therefore, it can be suggested that, for larger
flakes, it is the increased concentration of oxygen functional groups
on the graphitic surface that induced the localized structural rigidity.
This also played an important role in the increased surface roughness,
whereas the edge effects play a dominant role in the roughness and
dynamics of the small size flakes.

2.2 Water
Structure and Dynamics
Investigating
the behaviors of water around the graphitic flakes can shed light
on how water structuring resulting from chemical, structural, and
dynamic differences of GO could affect protein folding and adsorption.
Several studies have investigated the properties that contributed
toward biomolecule adsorption to nanoparticles. For example, works
by Hughes and Walsh had emphasized that exploiting interfacial water
structuring was key for understanding selective behavior in peptides
binding to multifaceted gold nanoparticles and graphene.33,37 It was also highlighted that a highly structured water layer provides
favorable conditions for peptide adsorption at the nanostructured
surfaces. Another study uncovered that intermittent interactions with
water can mediate protein adsorption on surfaces, whereas longer lasting
interactions control the diffusion of water around the adsorption
sites.34,38 Another study highlighted that the hydration
shells of unfolded proteins are more compressible than those on the
folded ones contributing to protein denaturation because of pressure.39 Thus, by understanding the hydration patterns
around the graphitic nanoparticles, we can help elucidate how they
could influence the binding motifs of proteins on the nanoparticle
surface.1,32,40−42

To better understand the water molecule behavior around the
graphitic nanoparticles, GO–water radial distribution function
(RDF) and water dipole analyses were performed. Figure 3 shows the solute (O)–water (H) RDFs
for the rGO and GO flakes. For the PG flakes, the RDF was calculated
between the carbon atoms and the water molecules. In Figure 3A, a formation of hydration
shells around the rGO and GO flakes can be clearly identified by two
characteristic peaks. The first water shell for all the three flake
sizes (3, 5, and 7 nm) can be found around 0.15–0.25 nm from
the nanoparticle surface, with a second water shell forming between
0.25 and 0.35 nm. The RDF results for the PG flakes identified the
first hydration shell at 0.25–0.3 nm from the nanoparticle
because of graphene’s hydrophobic nature of hydration.43 For both rGO and GO flakes, the amplitude of
each RDF peak is consistent between the two flake sizes for both water
shells. This suggests that because of the low roughness and smaller
hydrophobic areas on the 3 nm rGO and GO flakes, there is higher density
of water molecules in the first water shells around these nanoparticles.
A small peak indicating a possible third water layer between 0.5 and
0.7 nm can be seen for the 3 nm rGO and GO flakes. However, this characteristic
third peak is not visible for the 5 and 7 nm flakes, as after 0.6
nm, the RDF approaches that of bulk water. It is important to note
that the positions of the first two hydration shell peaks do not change
with the flake size; however, the magnitude does. In Figure 3B,C, the RDF for
GO is significantly higher than for rGO, which suggests that as the
flake size and the degree of functionalization increase, more water
molecules are packed into the first hydration shell. These results
demonstrate that the graphitic nanoflakes can be tailored to have
different curvatures and provide varying degrees of affinity toward
water, which can be exploited to mediate protein binding.

Figure 3 RDFs between
water and graphene functional groups on differently
sized GO flakes: (A) 3, (B) 5, and (C) 7 nm.

Furthermore, water dipole analysis was performed for all
simulation
systems in order to determine how surface functional groups affect
water orientation in each of the observed hydration layers (see figures
in the Supporting Information). The dipole
orientation of each water molecule within each hydration layer and
bulk solution was calculated (measured relative to Z-axis). For the 3 and 5 nm particles, the dipole angle distributions
of the first and second hydration layers as well as the bulk water
all have a characteristic bell shape. The peak of this bell curve
rests around a 90° angle, indicating that the majority of water
molecules in these hydration layers are not orientationally influenced
by the surface functional groups of the smaller (3 and 5 nm) graphitic
flakes. By contrast, the water dipole angle distribution for the 7
nm GO flake exhibited a rougher profile compared to the smaller nanoflakes
with notable peaks between 40°–75° and 120°–160°.
This suggests that the highly oxidized larger flakes induce water
dipole orientation because of the significant number of water interactions
with hydrophilic functional groups on the flake surfaces and edges.
However, this induced dipole orientation does not extend past the
first water layer as observed in Figure S3. Although no induced dipole orientation was seen across any of the
simulated flakes below the 7 nm size, we observed an increase in bound
water with an increasing degree of oxidation across all nanoparticle
sizes, in line with the RDF results shown in Figure 3. Overall, it can be suggested that for the
GO nanoflakes studied here, the surface functionalization does provide
interaction sites for water; however, these interactions are not sufficient
to induce dipole orientation effects past the first hydration layer
and into bulk water.

2.3 Solvent-Accessible Surface
Area
The
solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of each graphitic model was
also calculated and expressed in terms of water-covered surface fractions
(%), as illustrated in Figure 4. It can be clearly seen that as the degree of functionalization
increased, the percentage of water coverage also increased. For GO
flakes, the average covered fraction of the surface by the first water
layer is approximately ∼88 ± 1–2% across all the
three flake sizes. As the degree of functionalization decreased to
rGO and PG, a significant drop in water coverage was observed. Specifically,
the water coverage range was ∼60–70 ± 3–4%
for rGO and ∼42–53 ± 3–6% for PG. Interestingly,
the increased size did not increase the coverage. In fact, at a lower
functionalization, the degree of water coverage decreased with an
increase in the flake size. The 3 nm rGO flake had an average coverage
of 71 ± 4%, which reduced to 59 ± 3% for the 7 nm flake.
A similar trend was also observed for the PG flakes, with 53 ±
3% and 42 ± 6% coverage fractions for 3 and 7 nm flakes, respectively.
This decrease in water coverage can be attributed to the significant
increases in the surface area of hydrophobic patches on either side
of the basal plane. This observation explains the aggregation behavior
illustrated by Bansal et al.,28 where repulsive
interactions between the flakes increased with increasing functionalization.
As a result, more water was displaced from the surface of less functionalized
flakes allowing for smaller interlayer spacing to occur, driven by
hydrophobic surface association. As highlighted by Tang et al.,18 the initial distance between the graphitic flakes
plays an important role in their aggregation velocity. Therefore,
the increased fraction of hydrophobic patches observed here for less
functionalized GO flakes can explain the experimentally observed aggregation
behaviors.18,28

portion of the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to visualize the
first hydration layer.

3 Conclusions
The MD simulation characterized
the surface roughness of a series
of nanoscale PG flakes with various degrees of functionalization,
as well as the characterized water behavior around these graphitic
nanoparticles. Our results showed that the roughness of the GO flakes
increases with their size and degree of functionalization. In addition,
increasing the surface functionalization greatly increased the GO
affinity to water, increasing the ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic
surface areas as the degree of oxidation increased. However, the affinity
for water did not cause any water structuring past the first water
layer, with the effects of functional groups on water dipole alignment
only evident for the 7 nm GO flake. The findings of this study contribute
to understand the structure dynamics and hydration of graphitic nanoparticles.
The ability to control the shape and hydration level of the graphitic
nanoparticles can lead to the design and optimization of nanomaterials
to modulate the protein binding in biomedical applications.

4 Methodology
4.1 Graphitic Nanoflake Models
The GO
flakes of different sizes and degrees of oxidation were built using
the BIOVIA Materials Studio software suite.44 In order to model GO with varying functionalities, a script was
generated to randomly assign functional groups to a PG surface of
[3 × 3] nm, [5 × 5] nm, and [7 × 7] nm in size (herein
simply denoted as 3, 5, and 7 nm particles for ease of discussion)
in accordance with the chemical composition described in the literature.4 These GO flake sizes are consistent with the
applications of graphitic particles in a biologically relevant environment,
where size compatibility is required to study the peptide/protein
adsorption on the particle surface. We ensured that the induced randomness
in the functional group distribution did not violate any physicochemical
principles.45,46 Initial geometry optimization
was then performed using the COMPASS II47 force field to ensure no steric clashes existed. A total of three
oxidation states of GO were created for each nanoflake size: PG, reduced
GO (rGO with the C/O ratio of 10:1), and GO (GO with the C/O ratio
of 5:1). The degree of oxidation used in this study to model the GO
and rGO nanoflakes are in line with the experimentally determined
ratios of 4:1 for GO48 and 10:1 for rGO.49 This generated nine different graphene nanoflake
models for subsequent simulations in an explicit solvent (Figure 5).

The bonded
interactions for GO were taken from the CGenFF force field,50,51 which utilizes an atom-typing approach whereby the parameters are
assigned through analogies with an existing database of molecules.
This approach was applied in recent studies investigating the accuracies
of force fields for modeling the chemical and physical properties
of GO.52 Such a method of parameterization
avoids the need to combine the parameters from various other force
fields.7,19,22,24 It is important to recognize that when the interactions
between a nanoparticle and the biological molecules are of interest,
a consistent set of interatomic potentials needs to be used to model
each individual system component as well as the entire nano–bio
complex.14,53−56 With this in mind, the choice
of CGenFF, which is compatible with the CHARMM group of biological
force fields, is appropriate for applications to nano-biosystems aimed
as a follow-up of this work.57 In this
study, the bonded GO parameters from CGenFF were plugged into CHARMM22*
for all simulations. The QEq algorithm58 was used to determine the partial atomic charges based on the experimental
zeta-potential of GO as measured by Konkena and Vasudevan for GO at
varying pH values.59 Specifically, the
zeta-potential of GO at neutral pH (−44 mV) was used, which
resulted in a total surface charge of −0.04 e/nm2, and neutralized by counterions. The partial charges for PG and
rGO were equilibrated to produce a neutral particle, in line with
a standard simulation practice.24

investigated in this study.

4.2 Simulation Details
All simulations
were performed using the GROMACS 5.0.5 software package,60−62 using classical MD with interatomic interactions parameterized as
described in the above section. The van der Waals and electrostatic
interactions were truncated at 1 nm with long-range electrostatics
calculated by the particle mesh Ewald summation method.64 Each graphitic particle was suspended in a cubic
simulation box sufficiently large (allowing at least 1.5 nm separation
between the particle and the edge of the box) to prevent mirror image
interactions. In vacuo energy minimization was performed to eliminate
any steric clashes using the steepest descent algorithm. The simulation
box was then solvated with TIP3P water65 and another energy minimization was performed. An MD simulation
at a constant number of particles, constant volume, and temperature
(NVT ensemble) was conducted for 1 ns to equilibrate
the water molecules around the graphitic nanoparticle. Following this,
the MD simulations were performed for 200 ns for each system under
the isothermal–isobaric conditions (NPT ensemble).
The constant pressure and temperatures were maintained via the Berendsen
barostat66 and v-rescale thermostat,67 respectively. The LINCS algorithm61 was applied to constrain the bond lengths to
their equilibrium values, which allowed for a simulation time step
of 2 fs to be used.

4.3 Data Analysis
All analyses were carried
out on the final 50 ns of the simulated trajectory, with the convergence
being confirmed by the RMSD (within 0.3 nm) of the graphitic structure
and total energy reaching a plateau. The average surface roughness
for each graphitic system was measured using the 10-point roughness
method,68 where Z-axis
coordinates of every carbon atom relative to the starting structure
are used, ignoring the “out-of-plane” and diffusive
motion. The five maximum and five minimum values of the Z-axis coordinates for each frame were then determined, and the difference
between the average maximum and minimum values was taken as the roughness
measured of the flake at that specific frame. Atomic RMSF analysis
was performed on the aligned trajectories (as described above) to
determine the effects of size and functionalization on the flake dynamics.
In addition, RDFs between water molecules and the functional groups
and carbon atoms, as well as water dipole analyses, were utilized
to better understand the water structuring around the graphitic particles
and its role in the observed curvature patterns and dynamics of the
GO flakes. The SASA of each flake was measured using the VMD SASA
analysis tool.69
