Recent
advances and demands in biomedical applications drive a
large amount of research to synthesize easily scalable low-density,
high-strength, and wear-resistant biomaterials. The chemical inertness
with low density combined with high strength makes h-BN one of the
promising materials for such application. In this work, three-dimensional
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) interconnected with boron trioxide
(B2O3) was prepared by easily scalable and energy
efficient spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. The composite structure
shows significant densification (1.6–1.9 g/cm3)
and high surface area (0.97–14.5 m2/g) at an extremely
low SPS temperature of 250 °C. A high compressive strength of
291 MPa with a reasonably good wear resistance was obtained for the
composite structure. The formation of strong covalent bonds between
h-BN and B2O3 was formulated and established
by molecular dynamics simulation. The composite showed significant
effect on cell viability/proliferation. It shows a high mineralized
nodule formation over the control, which suggests its use as a possible
osteogenic agent in bone formation.

1 Introduction
Analogous
to graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) possesses
high oxidation resistance and chemical stability, along with high
surface area and thermal conductivity.1−4 Therefore, developing nanostructured three-dimensional
(3D) h-BN is expected to increase its significance in applications.5−7 Various routes (chemical, mechanical, chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), and microwave irradiation) are employed for synthesizing porous
nanostructured BN-based materials.8−11 It is extensively prepared by
reaction of boric acid, B2O3 or borax with C
and N/NH3 and urea at high temperatures around 2000 °C.
For nanostructured BN, laser ablation, CVS, and carbothermal reduction
of B4C and B2O3 are reported.12 A transient BO-based liquid phase helps densification
at <1000 °C, although the h-BN and the matrix phases develop
at ∼1600 °C depending on the low free energy of formation
of h-BN.13 The low melting point of B2O3 (450 °C) and low viscosity of melts of
B2O3 help low-temperature consolidation of these
compositions. For instance, a one-step synthesis of porous template-free
BN microsponges for hydrogen storage application14 and a template-assisted continuous 3D network of BN aerogels
having borazine precursor for oil/organic solvent absorption were
proposed recently.15 However, compared
to graphene, the synthesizing routes for few-layered BN nanosheets
are less effective due to the strong lip–lip interactions between
the adjacent concentric shells of BN basal planes.16−18 The mechanical
cleavage method for preparing h-BN is not suitable for scale up.19

Various forms of 3D porous nanostructured
materials have been developed
by different synthesis methods: bottom-up approaches like solution
processing and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and microwave irradiation.
However, these processes yield products having lower modulus (<10
MPa) and mechanical strength values. Spark plasma sintering (SPS)
technique allows densification of various ceramic powders at lower
temperature and shorter dwell time due to rapid heating and cooling
rates. The controlled grain growth in this process leads to desired
material properties.20 Recently, Chakravarty
et. al. reported 3D porous graphene by SPS as the implants. They achieved
significant mechanical strength of 40 ± 3 MPa, stiffness of 8
± 1 kN/m, and Young’s modulus of 4.1 ± 0.5 GPa.21 More recently, Gautam et. al. reported a detailed
investigation on synthesis of porous h-BN 3D architecture for effective
humidity and gas sensor applications using B2O3 as an additive, which is responsible for the porous structure.22

In the present work, attempts have been
made to synthesize 3D hBN–B2O3 composite
using the SPS technique. The synthesized
3D structures are demonstrated to be structurally stable, mechanically
strong, and biologically viable and sufficiently biocompatible to
be used as bone implant. The MD simulation has been performed to understand
the role of B2O3 in interconnecting h-BN to
build the 3D structure and its effect on mechanical properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Route, Sample Nomenclature,
and Mechanism
A typical structure having differently oriented
h-BN sheets intercalated
by the second-phase B2O3 particles and forming
strong covalent bonds under application of current and pressure in
SPS has been proposed, as shown in the schematic Figure 1a. The nomenclature xBNBO was used for the samples synthesized in the current
work, where “x” stands for the weight
percent of h-BN. This obviously implies that the B2O3 percentage for that sample is (100 – x).

(b) Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of pure h-BN showing
the tiny interconnected sheets of h-BN. (c, d) Low and high-magnification
SEM images of sample BN–B2O3 (BNBO) showing

shows fully developed and well interconnected nanosheets of h-BN with
minor porosity dispersed in glassy matrix of B2O3.

2.2 Morphology
Evolution
The influence
of B2O3 concentration on grain growth, morphology,
and general microstructure of BNBO composites was microscopically
analyzed. Figure 1b
shows a typical SEM image of pure h-BN consisting of tiny sheets sintered
to each other. The digital image of the sample sintered at 250 °C
is shown in the inset. A SEM image of a typical BNBO sample reveals
large interconnected h-BN sheets (marked by arrow in Figure 1c). The high-magnification
image (Figure 1d) clearly
reveals the 3D porous, interconnected architecture of the hBN–B2O3 composite with the fibrous morphology of B2O3, as indicated by the dotted region. The high-magnification
SEM micrograph shown in Figure 1e, corresponds to a high concentration h-BN sample and shows
interconnected submicron (∼0.4 μm) h-BN sheets, represented
by arrows, with large pores at a few regions created by partial evaporation
of B2O3 during sintering. It is well known that
B2O3 forms liquid phase during sintering; this
might explain the high densification rate in the samples even at an
extremely low SPS temperature. Formation of liquid phase may also
promote orientation of the h-BN grains by processes such as grain
boundary rotation.23

The transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images, as shown in Figure 2a–d, correspond to those for the composition
90BNBO and are consistent with the observations made in the SEM images.
The general macrostructure of the B2O3 particles
dispersed in the h-BN nanosheets is shown in Figure 2a. The h-BN sheets appear to be of 100–250
nm in diameter. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
image in Figure 2b
reveals a layered h-BN structure with an interlayer distance of 0.34
nm corresponding to the inter-plane distance (002), in agreement with
a previous report.24 This image also reveals
the interface between h-BN and B2O3. The inset
of Figure 2b shows
the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern corresponding
to (002), (101), (004), and (110) lattice planes of h-BN and reveals
the crystalline phase of h-BN, consistent with the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) results (Figure S1a). The high-magnification
TEM image in Figure 2c shows randomly oriented layers of h-BN and indicates the B2O3 matrix in the darker regions. The fast Fourier
transform patterns (in Figure 2c) display hexagonal spots with rotation angle of about 11°,
which is also corroborated by Figure 2d, which shows an array of h-BN atoms arranged periodically
in a hexagonal symmetry with the lattice constant like the values
of bulk h-BN, as previously reported.25

eV, respectively.

2.3 Structural
Analysis
XPS shows the
distribution of elemental boron (B), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and
carbon (C) in the samples, Figure 2e. The major peaks of these elements were present at
194.2, 398.1, 535, and 287 eV. The observation is in close agreement
with previous reports.25,26 Boron, nitrogen, and oxygen 1s-core
levels bear the signature of the formation of hBN–B2O3 composites.27,28 Carbon pick up is from
the SPS graphite mold.

The XRD pattern of all hBN–B2O3 composites shown in the Supporting Information Figure S1a, indicates hexagonal h-BN structure
with the two major diffraction peaks at 26.56° (002) and 41.46°
(100). With increase in B2O3 content peak, broadening
is observed and a low intensity peak of B2O3 appears as a shoulder adjacent to the high intensity h-BN peak at
26.56°. The broadening of the peaks confirms a fine-grained microstructure.
The intensity of this peak increases with the doping concentration
of B2O3. A low intensity B2O3 peak was also observed at 14.34°. The Raman spectrum
in Supporting Information Figure S1b shows
peaks associated with the B–N and B–O bonds at wave
numbers 1417, 1730, and 1961 cm–1, corresponding
to B–N stretching vibrations.19 Differential
thermal analysis (DTA) results from Supporting Information Figure S1c indicate the presence of various endothermic
as well as exothermic peaks. The peak at 449 °C occurs due to
diffusion of B2O3 into h-BN,29 whereas the other peaks are due to impurity phases and
moisture. The endothermic peaks at 164 and 441 °C appear due
to boron trioxide and h-BN in the initial mixture. The thermogravimetric
(TG) curve indicates weight loss with temperature in the sample. The
Supporting Information Figure S2a shows
a decrease in surface area with h-BN content, and the values lie between
0.97 and 14.43 m2/g. The evaporation of B2O3 is responsible for the formation of pores and increase in
surface area during sintering at high temperatures. The high surface
area of ∼14.43 m2/g for the 10BNBO sample was possibly
due to the amorphous nature of B2O3.30 The Supporting Information Figure S2b shows the variation in density of the composites
with B2O3 content.

2.4 Contact
Angle Study
The hydrophilicity
of the composites is critical to explain biocompatibility and degradability
of the samples, as it controls cell suspension and transfer of body
fluids. The contact angles of all of the composites were measured
and are shown in Supporting Information Figure S3a–d. It was observed from the figure that the contact
angle values increase with h-BN concentration from 53.44° for
10BNBO to 75.65° for 90BNBO.

2.5 Mechanical
Analysis
The compressive
stress–strain curves for pure h-BN, 50BNBO, and 90BNBO samples,
indicated by curves 1–3 respectively, are shown in Figure 3a. The tests were
conducted using an Instron universal testing machine (UTM) (Figure 3a). Digital images
of samples before and after fracture are also shown in the inset.
The maximum compressive strength of 291 MPa was observed for the sample
with composition 90BNBO having a density 1.9 g/cm3; thereby
yielding a bone material index of 153. This value is superior to trabecular
human bone having density 1.8 g/cm3 and compressive strength
of 221 MPa having a material index of 123.31 This observation fulfills the mechanical criteria for this material
as a possible substitute to commercial bone implant materials in use.
A comparison of the synthesis method, mechanical properties, porosity,
and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area for porous
nanostructured 3D graphene and h-BN synthesized by SPS is listed in Table 1. It is observed from
the table that the 3D h-BN exhibits better mechanical properties in
comparison to other reported ceramic biomaterials, viz. HAp,32,33 tricalcium phosphate,34 and HAp-based
composites.35 These biomaterials possess
lower strength in comparison to the metallic implants produced by
the laser engineered net shaping method.36 This may be due to randomly oriented large h-BN sheets along different
crystallographic planes.

The microstructural behavior of the fractured h-BN and BNBO samples
after compressive loading was also studied. Figure 3b shows the real-time load bearing capacity
of the samples, with a 2 kg block being placed over the sample. The
fracture image of the h-BN sample, as shown in Figure 3c, shows big h-BN sheets along with high
amount of porosity with minimal strength and load bearing capacity.
On the contrary, the fracture image of the BNBO samples in Figure 3d,e yields an interconnected
microstructure, as also observed from the subsequent simulations studies,
leading to their higher strength; in concurrence with the compression
plot in Figure 3a.
The predominance of elongated h-BN grains in the fractured microstructure,
as seen in the inset of the Figure 3a, is attributed to the grain growth induced in presence
of B2O3 and may lead to an improved toughness
in the composites. To validate the mechanical behavior of the synthesized
BNBO composites, the wear rate “Ws” was also evaluated, as shown in Figure 3f. From the figure, the specific wear rate
was observed to decrease exponentially with load. The higher wear
rate during the initial loading is due to breaking of weaker van der
Waals bonds between adjacent h-BN sheets in the h-BN-dominated regions
of the matrix; the subsequent decrease in wear rate is due to presence
of strong covalent bonding between h-BN and B2O3 in the remaining part of the matrix.

2.6 Molecular
Dynamics Simulation of 3D Composites
To establish the effect
of SPS processing on mechanical property
enhancement in the BNBO composites, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
was performed. The MD was separated into two parts; the first part
tries to mimic the SPS process where B2O3 is
mixed with h-BN nanosheets and a compressive strain (load) was applied
at constant velocity until the structure reduces its original size
up to 60%, as shown in Figure 4a (state 1), followed by the compressive force being slowly
released (unload) till the applied force is 0 (state 2). In the second
part, the resulting BNBO composite is subjected to a mechanical test
through a tensile strain, as shown in the inset of Figure 4a.

Figure 4 MD simulation of BNBO:
(a) compressive strain curve for the BNBO
composite formation. The symbols “1” and “2”
represent the BNBO mixture at maximum compression (∼60%) and
the formed BNBO composite, respectively. The inset shows the required
force (tensile strain) to stretch the BNBO composite compared to a
pure h-BN structure. (b) Snapshots of the entire simulation process.
(1) “Initial”: the initial configuration, a mixture
of h-BN/B2O3; (2) “sintered”:
the structure at maximum compression (60%); and (3, 4) “strained”:
the BNBO composite under tensile strain in two different stages.

The snapshots in Figure 4a clearly show that the B2O3 and h-BN
nanosheets react covalently leading to a 3D interconnected network
in the composite. The snapshot “state 1” shows the composite
at its maximum strain and “state 2” represents the 3D
structure in its final relaxed state. The hysteresis in the compressive
strain curve represents the permanent deformation in the BNBO structure.
The tensile strain curves in the inset of the Figure 4a show the force necessary to stretch up
the BNBO composite compared to a pure h-BN structure. In the composite
case, a larger force is required to pull apart the h-BN nanosheets
due to the covalent bonds formed between B2O3 and h-BN during the simulated SPS process, in contrast to the pure
h-BN nanosheets, where only van der Waals forces are present along
the pulling direction. The snapshots showed in the Figure 4b represent four different
stages of the compressive/tensile strain of the BNBO composite.

2.7 In Vitro Cytotoxicity to Mice Calvarial Osteoblast
(MCO) Cells
The toxicity study of the different compositions
was performed on mice calvarial osteoblast (MCO) cells. The samples
showed no significant toxicity on MCO cells at different concentrations
ranging from 1 to 100 μg/mL. In Figure 5a, treatment with 25 μg/mL (∼58%, p < 0.01), 50 μg/mL (∼77%, p < 0.01), and 100 μg/mL (∼69%, p < 0.01) of 90BNBO showed significant proliferation of osteoblast
cells as compared to control. However, MCO cells treated with 1 and
5 μg/mL of 90BNBO composite powder showed a fall in cell viability
as compared to control. There were no statistically significant changes
in proliferation/viability of osteoblast cells with the other samples
having higher B2O3 content.

Figure 5 (a) 90BNBO composition
increases cell proliferation of mouse calvarial
osteoblast (MCO) cells. Cells were cultured in differentiation medium
and treated with various concentrations of the 90BNBO samples ranging
from 1 to 100 μg/mL for 48 h, and cell viability was assessed
by MTT assay. The percent viable cells were calculated compared to
untreated cells taken as control. Data represent the mean ± SEM
(**p < 0.01 compared to control). (b) Mice calvarial
osteoblasts cells were grown in osteoblast differentiation medium.
Cultures were maintained for 21 days. At the end of the experiments,
cells were stained with alizarin red-S. Upper panel: representative
photomicrographs showing mineralized nodules in various groups with
or without treatment. Lower panel: alizarin red-S dye was extracted
and mineralization quantified spectrophotometrically. Data represent
the mean ± SEM (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared to control).

2.8 Osteogenic Activity Analysis
The
osteogenic activity of the composites was investigated by MTT assay.37,38 MCO cells were cultured for 21 days with and without the sample,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and drops of alizarin red-S was added,
which stains the calcium deposition. The 90BNBO sample revealed significant
increase in mineralization. Quantification of mineralization yields
significant increase in mineralized nodule formation in the presence
of 90BNBO. Data from this study suggest that the 90BNBO sample at
concentrations 10 nM (p < 0.05), 100 pM (p < 0.05), and 1 pM (p < 0.01) was
found to be potent, and showed increase in mineralization by ∼34%
(10 nM), ∼53% (100 pM), and ∼91% (1 pM) over the control
(untreated cells), as shown in Figure 5b. However, there were no statistically significant
changes in mineralization of osteoblast cells with the other samples
having higher B2O3 content. These investigations
clearly point out the potency of the current developed composites
to be used clinically as bone implant materials.

3 Conclusions
Three-dimensional nanostructured high strength
hBN–B2O3 composites were synthesized
using SPS and their
microstructure and properties were correlated. A highly interconnected
network was observed in the microstructural observations. B2O3 enhances densification and influences the grain orientation
in h-BN. Samples could be sintered to high density at an abnormally
low temperature of only 250 °C in 2 min possessing a high compressive
strength of ∼291 MPa. For investigating the suitability of
these materials as possible implant substitutes, cell viability and
proliferation tests were investigated. The results show significant
effect of 90BNBO composite on cell viability/proliferation. The same
composition also shows good mineralized nodule formation over control
and suggests its use as an osteogenic agent in bone formation. The
substantially high material index (compared to human bone), extremely
good mechanical properties, and impressively high cell culture performance
makes this composite material a promising candidate for use in knee
and bone implants.

4 Methods and Materials
4.1 Synthesis of h-BN Composites
In the
present study, a series of composites in the system x[h-BN]–(100 – x)[B2O3] (x = 10, 50, 70, 90 mol %) were prepared
using analytical reagent grade chemicals comprising h-BN (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.99%) and B2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%). The
appropriate amounts of these chemicals were calculated based on the
composition of the composite and they were weighed using an electronic
balance (Shimadzu make), mixed in a mortar and pestle using an acetone
medium for 6 h, dried, and calcined at 1000 °C in an electric
furnace to remove the volatile impurities. Subsequently, these powders
were processed in SPS at different sintering conditions. SPS was performed
in a Dr Sinter 1050 apparatus (SPS Syntex Inc., Japan). The sintering
conditions are as follows: the temperature was between 150 and 250
°C, applied pressure was 20 and 30 MPa, ramp rate was 75 °C/min
with 2 min dwell. Samples of 15 mm diameter and thickness 5.95–8.02
mm were prepared.

4.2 Material Characterization
XRD was
done using Cu Kα radiation in a Rigaku D/Max Ultima II equipment.
Elemental analysis for different chemical compositions was carried
out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera XPS)
on a PHI-5000C ESCA system. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
thermal analysis (DTA) were carried out in a SDTQ-600 thermal analyzer
from room temperature to 400 °C at 5 °C/min under flowing
N2. The BET surface area analysis was carried out in a
Quanta Chrome Autosorb-3b BET Surface Analyzer. An FEI Quanta 400
SEM was used at 10 kV for microstructure observations. The sample
was sputtered with gold film to prevent charging. The TEM images and
SAED patterns were obtained in a JEOL 2100 field emission gun transmission
electron microscope. Instron universal testing machine (UTM) was used
to obtain the load versus displacement curves from the samples at
room temperature. For wear test a pin-on-disc-type machine (DUCOM
model TR-20LE) was used in the dry condition. Tangential frictional
force and wear were monitored and recorded. Specific wear rate was
obtained from  where, ΔV: volume loss
(mm3), ρ: density of sample (g/cm3), P: applied load (N), L: sliding distance
(m), m1 and m2 are the weights before and after test.

Contact angle was measured
using an Advanced goniometer (500, Rame-Hart, Inc.) under equilibrium
conditions.

4.3 Cell Culture and MTT Assay
For each
experiment of MTT and mineralization, about 5–10 calvaria were
collected from new born Bal b/c mice pups. They were removed from
the skull surgically; sutures were separated and soft tissues were
removed by scrapping. The calvariae were kept together for repeated
digestion in dispase and collagenase P enzymes (0.1% each) for release
of cells, and the supernatant was discarded. Cells from subsequent
three to four digestions were pooled and cultured in α-MEM supplemented
with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere.39

The toxicity experiments
for all of the synthesized compositions were performed on mice calvarial
osteoblast (MCO) cells. The seed density was 2.0 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate and cultured as before with and without
the samples at different concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μg/mL.
MTT assay was done to check the cell viability.40 The cells were incubated for 3 h with MTT reagent at a
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and dimethyl sulphoxide was added for dissolving the formazan.

MCO cells with seed density 10.0 × 103 cells/well
in 12-well plates were cultured with and without samples and treated
at concentrations ranging from 100 μM to 1 pM for 21 days; the
media was refreshed once every 48 h. After experimentation, the cells
were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with
alizarin red-S (40 mM, pH 4.5) for 30 min, and washed with water to
remove the unbound stain.41 Photographs
of stained cells were captured and alizarin red-S stain was extracted
using 10% cetylpyridiniumchloride (CPC), which was used to quantify
the bound stain. The extracted stain was solubilized in 10% CPC with
gentle shaking. The absorbance of the solubilized stain was read at
562 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer. The data were analyzed
using one-way ANOVA followed by the Newman–Keuls test of significance
with software Graph Pad Prism version 5.0. Probability p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

4.4 Simulation
MD simulations were carried
out using the open source software LAMMPS42 with the fully atomistic reactive force field called ReaxFF.43 ReaxFF allows the chemical reactions as bond
formation and/or breaking to be accurately estimated by parameterization
through experimental data and the density functional theory calculations.
The parameterization used in this work is described elsewhere.44 The structures subjected to the compressive
strain were initially equilibrated during 200 ps under NPT at 300
K and no pressure using Nose–Hoover integrator scheme.45 The simulation box was kept within the periodic
boundary conditions along all directions to avoid any border effect.
The tensile strain case the periodicity along z direction
was removed to allow the outer h-BN sheets to be pulled up through
their center of mass. The strain velocity in all cases was kept 0.002
Å/fs and the time step 0.1 fs.
