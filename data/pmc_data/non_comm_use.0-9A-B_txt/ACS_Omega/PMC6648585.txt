An
environmentally benign, highly efficient, and base-promoted
selective amination of various polyhalogenated pyridines including
the challenging pyridine chlorides to 2-aminopyridine derivatives
using water as solvent has been developed. Featuring the use of the
new method, the reaction is extended to the transformation on a large
scale. Mechanistic studies indicate that the pathway involving a base
aidant dissociation of N,N-dimethylformamide
to generate dimethylamine is likely.

Introduction
2-Aminopyridine-halogenated
analogues are value-added feedstocks
to develop natural products,1 fine chemicals,2 and biologically active molecules.3 Furthermore, they are also commonly used as multipurpose
building blocks for the preparation of ligands in organometallic chemistry.4 Thus, the applications have created enormous
attention and demand to develop highly chemoselective, efficient,
and practical methods for the preparation of 2-aminopyridine derivatives.

The chemoselective amination of polyfunctional pyridines is important
for rapid diversification.5 In recent years,
several efficient approaches mainly occupied by the noble-metal Pd
catalyst systems to synthesize 2-aminopyridine derivatives have been
reported.6 These works represent great
advancement in catalytic polyhalogenated pyridine amination. However,
such methods may be undesirable for pharmaceutical production, as
the protocols involve using large amounts of precious metal resources,
typically increasing the cost of the preparation process.7 Therefore, the development of low-cost and environmentally
benign methods for the selective amination of polyhalogenated pyridine
derivatives is of great interest.

According to the report,8 avoiding the
use of noble transition metals and employing water as solvent is one
of the important characteristics of environmental synthesis. However,
chemoselective amination of polyhalogenated pyridine derivatives using
these processes are still in its infancy.9 Park,10a Woydziak,10b and Gong10c reported a convenient
approach for the synthesis of aromatic amines through potassium hydroxide-promoted
amination of aryl halides, albeit using excessive amino sources as
solvent and coupling reagents (Scheme 1a).11 Recently, Li et al.
have developed sodium hydroxide-assisted amination of 2-fluoropyridine
derivatives with acetamidine hydrochloride to form 2-aminopyridines
(Scheme 1b).8 However, the substrate is restricted to 2-fluoropyridine
analogues, which is well known for its high reactivity in the nucleophilic
substitution.11 Despite these advances,
the highly selective, environmentally benign nonmetal systems for
the coupling of polyhalogenated pyridines with amines are extremely
rare, and the substrate scopes are also very restricted. Therefore,
for the polyfunctional pyridine scaffolds, it is of synthetic interest
and necessary to continue development of synthetic methods that have
environmental, practical, and high selectivity.

Scheme 1 Amination of Aromatic
Halides
Herein, we demonstrated
that sodium tert-butoxide
was highly active for site-selective amination of polyhalogenated
pyridines with various amino sources under mild conditions (Scheme 1c). This novel protocol
provided a practical and environmental access to construct 2-aminopyridine
halides and proceeded to completion with 3.0 equiv of NaOtBu, employing water as solvent in most cases.

Results and Discussion
N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was
generally used as a multipurpose block for numerous units in amination
protocols.12 Thus, our initial studies
focused on selective amination of 2,5-dibromopyridine (1a) using DMF (2a) as the coupling partner by examining
the catalytic activities of commonly available bases (Table 1, entries 1–5). It was
determined that the most suitable base was NaOtBu
when the reaction was run at 140 °C using DMF as solvent (entry
1). However, when the reaction was performed using KOAc (entry 4)
or K2CO3 (entry 5), only starting material 1a was recovered. Further optimization revealed that solvents
had important impacts on the amination process. A survey of solvents
established H2O as the optimal reaction medium, giving
product 3a in 73% yield (entry 7). As indicated in the
table, the protocol did not proceed in DCM (entry 10), resulting in
the large amounts of 1a recovering in the reaction. Further
optimization revealed that extending the reaction time to 12 h further
improved the yield to 99% (entry 11). However, lowering the temperature
of the process down to 100 °C resulted in inefficient amination
reaction with only 36% yield of 3a after 12 h (entry
12). On the contrary, the optimization result indicated that this
protocol could be conducted well with only 2.0 equiv of NaOtBu and DMF (entry 13).

e NaOtBu (1.0 mmol,

With the optimized
conditions in hands (Table 1, entry 11), we examined the substrate scopes
with respect to polyhalogenated pyridines for the amination processes.
As shown in Table 2, the bromo substituent at any position on 2-bromopyridine was compatible
(3a–3d), providing the yields of products ranging
from 51 to 95%. Notably, the reaction of 1a with 1.2
equiv of 2a and 1.5 equiv of NaOtBu
could give a monosubstituted product in 77% yield with excellent selectivity.
In addition, when a chloro group was at the 3-, 4-, or 5-position
of 2-bromopyridine, the processes also takes priority at the 2-position,
offering the products in moderate to excellent yields (3e–3h). The pyridine moiety containing an electron-donating substituent,
such as methyl, also underwent the amination process smoothly, offering
the unique product in a satisfying yield. Importantly, almost all
of the selected 2-fluoropyridine derivatives could be selectively
converted to 2-aminopyridine derivatives in good yields (3l–3o) by treatment of NaOtBu.

Pyridinesa
a Reaction conditions: 1 (0.5 mmol), 2a (1.0 mmol), NaOtBu
(1.5 mmol), H2O (2 mL), at 140 °C, 12 h. Yields shown
are of isolated products.

b 2a (0.6 mmol), NaOtBu (0.75 mmol).

Despite the low-cost advantages
of employing aryl chlorides as
coupling partners, the examples of selective amination of polyhalogenated
heterocycles are extremely rare.6 The abovementioned
good outcomes prompted us to continue to evaluate the amination of
more challenging pyridine chlorides. Delightfully, by using the standard
condition, functional groups including chloro, bromo, methyl, and
nitro could all be tolerated (3b, 3a, and 3p–3h). Moreover, to demonstrate the synthetic utility
further, we examined the amination of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine
with DMF. Excitingly, our reaction system allowed for the highly selective
formation of the mono-aminated pyridine (3r) in 78% yield.
In addition, we turned our attention to test the halogenated 2-iodopyridines.
Pleasingly, the 2-iodopyridine ring bearing the chloro (3g) or bromo (3a) group at its 5-position exhibited high
efficiency and excellent selectivity as well.

The substrate
scopes of reactions via altering N,N-dimethylamide analogues as the amino source were
also studied. As summarized in Table 3, by using NaOtBu as the promoter,
most of aromatic and aliphatic dimethylamides underwent amination
reactions smoothly. It is worth noting that all alkyl amide derivatives
(2b–2e), including sterically hindered isopropylamide 2f, were all well tolerated in the transformations, selectively
giving the corresponding amines in moderate to excellent yields. It
is generally known that aromatic amides are ineffective to this process
on account of the low nucleophilicity.13 However, to our delight, a methyl substituent at any position on
the aromatic ring was compatible (2h–2j), providing
products in high yields and with exclusive selectivity. Remarkably,
functionalities including phenyl (2k), amino (2l), ether (2m), and halide (2n–2p) groups were also tolerated.

a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol),
2 (1.0 mmol), NaOtBu (1.5 mmol), H2O (2
mL), at 140 °C, 12 h. Yields shown are of isolated
products.

The selective
amination was also successfully extended to the aliphatic
amines (Table 4). Most
transformations of alkylamines with 1a were remarkable
in their regiospecificity for the functionalization of pyridine derivatives
in the ortho position (3s–3a). Nevertheless, the
sterically hindered amines were incompatible for reactions due to
low nucleophilicity (3y–3z).

Table 4 Substrate Scopes of the Aminesa
a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol),
2 (1.0 mmol), NaOtBu (1.5 mmol), H2O (2
mL), at 140 °C, 12 h. Yields shown are of isolated
products.

With the highly
active and excellent selectivity system in hands,
we sought to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the reaction (Scheme 2). Employing 3.0
equiv of NaOtBu in water, the selective amination
of 1a could be scaled up to 0.5 mol, providing the desired 3a in 92% isolated yield.

Scheme 2 Large-Scale Reaction
In order to investigate the possible mechanism
of this amination
protocol, control experiments were conducted (Scheme 3). First, to examine the possibility of a
radical mechanism, the reactions in the standard conditions by using
commercially available radical scavengers, such as 9,10-dihydroanthracene,
BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), and TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxy)
were conducted (eq 1). However, these processes indicated that the
yields of 3a comparing with the protocol in the absence
of radical scavengers remained nearly constant. Similarly, the addition
of heterogeneous catalyst poisons Hg and PMe3 also showed
no inhibition on the yields of the products (eq 2).14 Therefore, these results indicated that the process was
likely to be homogeneous using the standard conditions and excluded
the radical mechanism.

Scheme 3 Control Experiments
In addition, to get some hint for the plausible mechanism,
the
reactions of 2,5-dibromopyridine with DMF and dimethylamine promoted
by NaOtBu gave the products all in 99% gas chromatography
(GC) yields (eq 3). Obviously, the data indicates that DMF is likely
to serve mainly as a source of dimethylamine for the process, which
has been widely utilized in synthetic reactions.12 To prove this hypothesis, we performed a blank test, performing
the reaction in the absence of 2,5-dibromopyridine under the standard
conditions (eq 4). With the analysis of the reaction mixture by headspace
GC (HSGC) and GC–mass spectrometry (MS), we discovered that
dimethylamine and t-butanol were formed in the process.
However, owing to the similar molecular weight of nitrogen with carbon
monoxide, we could not confirm whether carbon monoxide was formed
in this protocol.

As shown in Scheme 4, there are two plausible descriptions of
the selective amination
process involving DMF initiation of mechanistic cycles. Based on the
reported works, the protocol initiated the nucleophilic attack of
DMF on the C2-position of the polyhalogenated pyridine followed by
release of CO, producing the corresponding 2-aminopyridine halide
(route A).9a,15a The other is the process with
base aidant dissociation of DMF to generate dimethylamine, and then
reacts with the NaOtBu, providing the nucleophile
species and t-butanol in situ (route B).9a,15b Based on the reported works,9a,15a,15b the control experiments (Scheme 3, eqs 1–4) and kinetic studies (Figures S1–S3), the pathway B was more
likely.

Scheme 4 Two Proposed Mechanisms
Conclusions
In summary, we developed an environmental
and universal base-promoted
method for the amination of various fluoro-, bromo-, iodo-, and even
chloro-pyridine derivatives using water as solvent, providing halogenated
2-aminopyridine derivatives in moderate to excellent yields with high
selectivity. Overall, this novel protocol provides a facile and practical
access to the construction of 2-aminopyridines and offers an useful
alternative to the current methods, employing excess amino sources
or the widely used palladium catalysts.
