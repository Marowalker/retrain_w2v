Olivine-structured LiFePO4 is one of the most
popular
cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for sustainable
applications. Significant attention has been paid to investigating
the dynamics of the lithiation/delithiation process in LixFePO4 (0 ≤ x ≤
1), which is crucial for the development of high-performance LiFePO4 material. Various macroscopic models based on experimental
evidence have been proposed to explain the mechanism of phase transition
from LiFePO4 to FePO4, such as the shrinking
core (i.e., core–shell) model, Laffont’s (i.e., new
core–shell) model, domino-cascade model, phase transformation
wave, solid solution model, many-particle models, etc. However, these
models, unfortunately, contradict each other and their validity is
still under debate. An atomistic model is urgently required to depict
the lithiation/delithiation process in LixFePO4. In this article, we reveal the lithiation/delithiation
process in LiFePO4 simulated by a computational model using
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA + U)
method. We find that the clustered configuration is the most energetically
favorable, leading to co-operative Jahn–Teller distortion among
the inter-polyhedrons that can be observed clearly from the bond patterns.
This atomistic model not only offers answers to experimental results
obtained at moderate or high rates but also gives the direction to
further improve the rate capability of LiFePO4 cathode
material for high-power LIBs.

Introduction
Olivine-structured LiFePO4 is
fast gaining importance
in today’s energy world, especially in high-power energy storage
devices..1−4 LiFePO4, as a promising cathode material for high-power
Li-ion batteries, compared with conventional lead–acid, nickel–cadmium,
and even nickel–metal hydride batteries, are needed urgently
to meet the demands of large-scale applications such as electric vehicles
(EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).5,6 However,
the mechanism of the phase transition from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is still under debate, which is believed to be crucial for
the future development of high-performance LiFePO4 materials.7,8 Along with essential demands to incorporate unique features, the
understanding of the mechanism still attracts significant attention
and leads scientists toward investigating the dynamics of the lithiation/delithiation
process of LixFePO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), aiming at understanding the experimental
results obtained at moderate or high rates and also giving directions
to improve LiFePO4 for high-power LIBs.9−11

There
are two phases of LixFePO4 structures:
the highly anisotropic fully lithiated LiFePO4 (LFPO) and
its delithiated counterpart, FePO4 (FPO).
The lithiation/delithiation process in LixFePO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is commonly
accepted as a two-phase reaction mechanism, with the movement of Li+ ions confined along the b-axis.12 The pioneering work was carried out by Goodenough
et al.,1 who showed that the flat charge/discharge
profile of LiFePO4 arises from the motion of a two-phase
interface. Recently, various macroscopic models based on experimental
evidence have been proposed to explain the mechanism of phase transition
from FePO4 to LiFePO4, such as the shrinking
core (i.e., core–shell) model,1,13 Laffont’s
(i.e., new core–shell) model,14 domino-cascade
model,15 phase transformation wave,16,17 solid solution model,18 many-particle
models,19 etc. All of these models intend
to explain the lithiation/delithiation process in LiFePO4 to help understand the experimental results. However, these models
lack direct and convincing computational support. In this study, we
use an atomistic approach to calculate the energy that it takes to
incorporate Li+ ions into the FPO lattice. The method gives
us an understanding of the lithiation and delithiation processes,
which will be useful for future material development.

Results and Discussion
Here, we use the first-principles
density functional theory (DFT)
GGA + U method to study the configuration of the
lithium atoms because the method gives small error especially for
transition metals with active localization of d or f orbitals compared with conventional GGA and linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) methods.20−23 In the GGA + U framework, the onsite
Coulomb term U, and the exchange term J can be merged into a single effective parameter (U–J),24 and thus,
we only need to take U as an effective parameter
that can be numerically fitted by a self-consistent ab initio calculation.25 For the olivine FePO4 and LiFePO4 system, the value of U = 4.3 eV for Fe well
describes the ground state properties and is widely used in the literature.26−28 All of the calculations are performed by the Quantum Espresso package,29 with supercells (2a × b × 4c)
of eight-unit cells of LixFePO4. The kinetic energy of 600 eV has been used as the cutoff energy
for the plane-wave basis, and reciprocal-space k-point meshes of 1
× 3 × 1 have been used to ensure that the total energies
converge within five meV per supercell. Magnetism has also been taken
into considerations—both the ferromagnetic (FM) and anti-ferromagnetic
(AFM) ordering states have been calculated. Table 1 shows the cell parameter and band gap for
FePO4 and LiFePO4 structures, and the optimized
lattice parameter agrees well with the previous literature by the
linearized augmented plane-wave method30 and available experimental results.31,32 The FM and
AFM states give similar results, and the system is in a magnetic disorder
state at higher temperatures,33 we thus
only take the FM ordering for the total energy calculation for simplicity.

As shown in Figure 1a, the oxygen atoms in the FePO4 framework
are located
in a slightly distorted, hexagonal close-packed arrangement.35 The phosphorus atoms occupy tetrahedral sites
forming PO4 tetrahedrons with oxygen atoms. Iron atoms
are on corner-sharing octahedral positions forming FeO6 octahedrons, while lithium atoms occupy edge-sharing octahedral
positions forming LiO6 octahedrons. Each FeO6 octahedron is linked with another four FeO6 octahedrons
through the shared corners in the bc plane, forming
inclined planes, parallel to the c-axis (i.e., [001]
direction). The LiO6 octahedrons form edge-sharing chains
along the b-axis (i.e., [010] direction), creating
Li tunnels along this direction. Each FeO6 octahedron shares
the edges with two LiO6 octahedrons, while the PO4 tetrahedron shares one edge with one FeO6 octahedron
and two edges with LiO6 octahedrons, respectively.35,36 To study Li+-ion transport in LiFePO4, Morgan
et al.37 first used the first-principles
method and demonstrated that the diffusion coefficient (D) along the [010] direction was several orders higher than that along
the [001] direction. The result of D (path B[001])/D (path A[010]) ≈ 10–37 showed
that path B hardly made a contribution to the Li+-ion motion,
and the Li+ ions diffused through one-dimensional (1D)
channels along the [010] direction with a high energy barrier to cross
between the channels. This large barrier was attributed to the FeO6 octahedral transition state in path B face-sharing with two
PO4 tetrahedrons. Islam et al.35,38 further modeled the structure of LiFePO4 and investigated
Li+-ion migration energy in LiFePO4 by the atomistic
simulation method and found that Li-ion migration was preferential
along [010] channels, following a curved trajectory. Li et al.39 studied the conductivity of Li+ ions
along the three principal directions of LiFePO4 single
crystals as a function of temperature (325–525 K) by AC impedance
spectroscopy. Their results showed that Li+-ion diffusion
in LiFePO4 is, to a large extent, confined to 1D through
tunnels along the b-axis. Furthermore, the experimental
evidence of Li+-ion diffusion along the [010] direction
via PO4 tetrahedral interstitial sites in Li1–xFePO4 (x = 0.4) was provided
by combining high-temperature (620 K) powder neutron diffraction and
the maximum entropy method.40 However,
the mechanism of the phase transition from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is still under debate.9 When one
lithium atom is inserted into the FePO4 framework, the
reaction energy is defined as below: 1  

Figure 1 (a) Perspective view of the FePO4 framework with one
inserted Li+-ion along the b-axis. The
red, blue, and yellow sticks represent the FePO4 units,
and the green ball represents the Li+-ion; the light green
areas are the optional positions for nesting the second Li+-ion. (b) Side view of the FePO4 framework along the c-axis with two optional configurations marked by light
green and pink balls.

Here, ELFPO, EFPO, and ELi represent
the total
energy for the bulk LFPO, FPO, and bulk Li, respectively. For the
second or third lithium inserted into the system, the corresponding Ereac is defined similarly by replacing EFPO with the total energy before the lithium
being inserted. This process is shown as step 4 of Path 1 in Figure 2. To further confirm
the energy scale in this process, we compared the total energy gain
of Path 2, which is about the direct combination of Li+ and FPO– ions. Path 2 produced an energy difference
of −11.7 eV, which is very close to the summation of the energy
of −11.67 eV in all of the steps of Path 1.

Figure 2 Two parallel paths for
the LFPO products. Path 1 shows an energy
gain of 11.7 eV upon Li+ and FPO– ions
to the one Li-inserted FPO crystal, while Path 2 shows an energy gain
of 3.15 eV upon neutral Li and FPO structures to the one Li-inserted
FPO crystals. In Path 2, Li+ and FPO– ions are neutralized first and the Li atoms are crystallized as
well. The total energy gain from Li+ and FPO– to LFPO via Path 2 is 11.67 eV, very close to that via Path 1.

As shown in Figure 3a, the first lithium inserts into a FePO4 framework and
is put in the center of the cell along the b-axis.
An Ereac value of −3.15 eV was
obtained, indicating that there is an energy favor of 3.15 eV after
lithiation. The energy map for the third lithium insertion is shown
in Figure 3b, and the
optional positions for the second lithium inserting into FePO4 are marked in Figure 3c. Each optional position for the second lithium has two choices
along the c-axis, as shown by light green and light
red balls in Figure 1b. However, we found that the two configurations provide very similar
results from the energy map (Supporting Information Figures S1–S3), and so here we only focus on the case
as shown by the light green ball in Figure 1b.

for (a) the second
inserted lithium to the center of the lithium cluster, and (b) the
third inserted lithium to the two lithium clusters. (c) Optional lithium
insertion positions. The lithium atoms are marked as green balls,
and the optional positions for the lithium are marked by small triangles.
FePO4 polyhedra is not shown for clarity.

For the second inserted lithium, the value of Ereac generally increases when the distance between
the
two lithium ions increases. Ereac is around
−3.48 eV for the first nearest insertion positions as shown
in Figure 3a (marked
by blue triangles, corresponding to positions of a–f in Figure 3c), then increases
above −3.32 eV for the second nearest insertion positions as
shown in Figure 3b
(marked by cyan triangles, corresponding to positions of g–j
in Figure 3c), of which
the distance is about 1 nm to the center lithium. For the farthest
position k from the center (Figure 3c), the value of Ereac is
the highest, about −3.17 eV, which is very close to the Ereac of the first lithium (−3.15 eV).
The simulations indicate that the two Li+ ions prefer to
form clusters rather than be far apart in the FePO4 framework
at low lithium concentration and there is little interaction between
the two Li+ ions once the distance is larger than 1 nm.

When the third lithium is inserted, similar to the second lithium
insertion case, Ereac increases proportionally
with the distance from the third lithium to the center lithium cluster,
thus yielding a similar pattern. The favorable energy positions are
a, b, and d, which are the nearest positions around the center lithium
cluster. The Ereac of position a is about
−3.58 eV, which is a bit larger than that in the second lithium
insertion case (−3.48 eV). Moreover, Ereac of the clustering configuration (positions i, b, c, g,
e, and f in Figure 3c) is about 200 meV energetic favorite than the far-separated positions
(position k in Figure 3c). These results agree well with the previous two lithium cases,
and the inserted third lithium prefers to form cluster states rather
than the far-separated form. In 2006, Laffont et al.14 proposed a “new core–shell” model
based on studies with high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy
(HREELS). According to this model, Li+-ion migration along
1D channels is asynchronous. During charge, Li+-ions in
the center of the platelet particles were extracted first and moved
outward; whereas, during discharge, Li+-ion insertion started
from the periphery. Their study unambiguously supports the view that
the nanometer interfacial region consists of FePO4 and
LiFePO4, but not solid solution LixFePO4, which changes with the gradient of x ranging from 0 to 1 by moving from FePO4 to LiFePO4. This two-phase mechanism attributed to the nature of the
two phases. This Laffont’s new core–shell model accounts
well for 1D migration, perpendicular to the platelets. A similar result
was also observed by Chen et al.41 for
the electron microscopy study of the LiFePO4 to FePO4 phase transition, indicating that the Li+-ions
are extracted from narrow and disordered transition zones on the ac crystal plane as the phase boundary progresses in the
direction along the a-axis. In 2008, Delmas et al.15 presented a “domino-cascade” model
based on X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy technologies. This
model agrees well with the HREELS study reported by Laffont et al.,14 which shows that there is no solid solution
LixFePO4 in the interfacial region between the
two limit compositions. According to this model, when the lithium
insertion/extraction starts in a given particle, the particle rapidly
becomes either charged or discharged. One essential difference between
the new core–shell model and the domino-cascade model is the
character of the interface. The former supports the coexistence of
LiFePO4 and FePO4 regions inside each particle14 while the latter proposes the coexistence of
LiFePO4 and FePO4 particles that are single-domain,15 indicating the clustering configurations of
the lithium clusters in the FPO/LFPO phases. From Figure 3, we can see that the insertion
energy lowers down with the increase of Li+-ion concentration,
indicating that it is more likely for the Li+-ion to fill
the FPO. In our simulation, Ereac almost
converged to zero when the lithium atoms are separated beyond 2 nm.
Recently, some studies proposed that there was a solid solution zone
during the charging/discharging process as a metastable process,18 which only lasts for hundreds of seconds and
then turns into FPO/LFPO two phases. Another experiment observed the
direct evolution of the phase transformation in individual LFPO nanoparticles
during both slow and fast charge/discharge rates.42 The two experimental results provide solid support for
our model, i.e., the clustering procedure leads the system to a clear
final co-existing LFPO/FPO two-phase condition rather than a disorder
solid solution, where the LFPO and FPO are randomly mixed.

Figure 4 shows the
local bond patterns with 1, 2, and 3 Li+-ions inserted
into the FPO framework based on the clustered configuration. For FeO6 octahedrons, there are two kinds of Fe–O planar bond
lengths, which are 2.16 and 2.07 Å (corresponding to b1 and b3 in Figure 4a, respectively). Due to symmetry, the values of b1, b2, b5, b6, b9, and
b10 are equal, and the values of b3, b4, b7, b8, b11, and b12 are equal as well. Upon the insertion of one Li+-ion
(Figure 4b), the Fe–O
polyhedron is distorted and the bond length of b1 to b4 is increased by 0.3 Å due to the valence state change
from Fe(III) to Fe(II). The distortion of the FeO6 octahedron
also leads to the rotation of the PO4 tetrahedron with
the bond lengths of b5 and b6 being reduced.
Compared with FPO, the insertion of one Li atom leads to a total volume
increase (ΔV1) of about 10 Å3, while the total volume (ΔV2) increases by ca. 17 Å3 after two Li+ ions are inserted. The increased total volume is not in proportion
to the number of Li+-ions inserted (ΔV2 < 2ΔV1), indicating
that there is a local structural distortion preventing further volume
expansion. As shown in Figure 4c, when the second Li+ ion is inserted, the bond
lengths of b9 to b12 increase, but the bond
lengths of b7 and b8 decrease by 0.2 Å
due to the PO4 tetrahedron rotation, which induces slight
reduction of the bond lengths of b1 and b2.
This kind of distortion belongs to the typical co-operative Jahn–Teller
distortion,43 which is a local phase transition
driven by the localized orbital electronic states. The clustered configuration
of the Li+ ions favors the co-operative Jahn–Teller
distortion and results in the total energy minimization. For the third
Li insertion with a clustered configuration (Figure 4d), the total volume (ΔV3) increases by 23 Å3. Since ΔV3 < ΔV1 + ΔV2 < 3ΔV1, this again belongs to the co-operative Jahn–Teller
distortion. Due to the insertion of more Li+ ions, the
fraction of Fe(III) is further reduced, and the Fe–O bond length
increases in general. If there are more Li+ ions, as shown
by the white color in Figure 4d, there are more bonds with decreasing lengths, indicating
that the co-operative Jahn–Teller distortion dominates this
procedure for the clustering of the Li+ ions during the
lithiation process.

Figure 4 Local structure of the clustering configuration of the
FPO framework
with inserted Li numbers of (a) 0, (b) 1, (c) 2, and (d) 3. The black
and white bond colors indicate the bond patterns changing after the
insertion of Li+ ions. The yellow tetrahedrons correspond
to PO4, and the blue arrows represent the rotation of the
PO4 polyhedron after the insertion of more than one Li+ ions. The typical bond lengths are labeled from b1 to b12, which correspond to the structures in (a), (b),
and (c) only. The black and white colors represent the increased and
decreased bond lengths, respectively.

Conclusions
To summarize, by first-principles DFT calculation,
we provide a
clustering model to explain the lithiation/delithiation process with
low lithium concentration in the FePO4/LiFePO4 structure. We find that the amount of volume expansion decreases
when more lithium is inserted into the structure. From chemical bond
patterns, one can see that the co-operative Jahn–Teller distortion
is energetically favorable among the nearby FeO6 octahedrons
with the rotation of the PO4 tetrahedrons when the Li+-ions are arranged in a clustered configuration. These results
support that Li+-ions prefer to form clusters rather than
being far apart. Our result agrees well with the new core–shell
model.44
