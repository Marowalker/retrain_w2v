Direct
α-alkylation of amides and the synthesis of C3-alkylated
3-hydroxyindolin-2-one/2-substituted-2-hydroxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one derivatives from 2-oxindole/1-teralone were reported
using primary alcohols in the presence of Ru-NHC catalyst in a one
pot condition under the borrowing hydrogen method. In the case of
inert conditions, 2-oxindole/1-teralone exclusively forms the C3-alkylated
product. Whereas, allowing this reaction mixture to occur under an
air atmosphere predominantly forms C3-alkylated 3-hydroxyindolin-2-one
via domino C–H alkylation and aerobic C–H hydroxylation.
This Ru-NHC catalyst is easily accessible, air stable, and phosphine
free. Using this method, synthesis of 2-oxindole based natural products
such as Donaxaridine was accomplished.

1 Introduction
Quaternary
α-hydroxy carbonyl compounds are an important
scaffold in many natural products and small molecule drugs.1 In particular, the C3-hydroxy 2-oxindole skeleton
remains fascinating to the synthetic chemist as it constitutes a key
structural feature in natural products (Figure 1) such as TMC-95s, Donaxaridine, Arundaphine,
Maremycins, etc.2 A pivotal step in the
synthesis of such hydroxyl oxindole natural products is the construction
of quaternary α-hydroxy 2-oxindole. Over the past decade, several
synthetic approaches have been developed for the synthesis of quaternary
α-hydroxy carbonyl compounds, centered on the isatin/indole/2-oxindole
as the starting material,3 which require
multistep syntheses involving stepwise C3-substitution and subsequent
C–H hydroxylation. However, the direct synthesis of quaternary
α-hydroxyl amides from amides using alcohols as alkylating reagents
has never been explored. In recent developments on synthetic methodologies,
cooperative nitrogen- and phosphine-based donor ligands in a well-defined
metal catalyst for borrowing hydrogen strategy have emerged as green
and atom economical alternatives for the α-alkylation of ketones,4 which generate water as the only by-product.

Figure 1 Bioinspired
Natural Products/Drugs.

In this lineup, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) is a synthetically
accessible and highly useful ligand in various catalytic transformations,5 and it has been proven to be an effective catalyst
for alkylation reactions limited to only ketone and amine substrates.
For instance, a recent report by Glorius et al. delineated an in situ
generated Ru-NHC catalyst for the mono and double α-alkylation
of ketones.6 Huynh et al. described an
important application of Ru-NHC as a very effective and easily accessible
catalyst for the amination reactions using alcohols under the borrowing
hydrogen concept.7 Furthermore, Madsen
et al. and Hong et al. reported Ru-NHC catalyzed direct amide syntheses
using alcohols and amines. Very limited reports exist for the α-alkylation
of amides8 catalyzed by air sensitive cooperative
pincer-type complexes.

Likewise, C–H hydroxylation of
carbonyl compounds, considered
as an important organic transformation to generate hydroxyl functional
groups in many natural products, has been well studied as discrete
reaction steps in many multistep syntheses.9,10 Although
two discrete reaction steps for the C–H alkylation and hydroxylation
are known in the literature, the Ru-NHC catalyzed one pot C–H
alkylation and C–H hydroxylation of amide to get quaternary
α-hydroxy ketones/amides are not known in the literature. Further,
the synthesis of Donaxaridine, encompassing quaternary α-hydroxy
amide functionality, comprises multistep and longer synthetic routes.
The one pot condition for the synthesis of organic scaffolds, in which
many bond formations occur without isolation of the intermediates,
has attracted synthetic chemists in the last few decades.11 Hence, it is envisioned that developing a one
pot tandem approach for C3-alkylated 3-hydroxyindolin-2-one from 2-oxindole
will be advantageous over a multistep route for synthesizing Donaxaridine
and related natural products.

Recently, we reported12 the Ru-PNN catalyzed
alkylation and hydroxylation of amides using alcohols. This catalyst
requires an inert atmosphere condition and proceeds via the addition
of water to the Ru–alkoxy indole intermediates to afford the
C3-hydroxy 2-oxindole. Furthermore, Ru-PNN catalyst contains an electron-rich
phosphine ligand backbone, which is highly air sensitive. In continuation
of our efforts to identify a simple phosphine-free catalytic system,
herein, we demonstrated an air stable and well-defined Ru-NHC catalyst
for the domino α-alkylation of unactivated amides and 2-oxindole
using alcohols, and its subsequent exposure to aerobic oxidation to
get quaternary α-hydroxy amides (Scheme 1). In contrast to the known α-C–H
hydroxylation of ketones using oxidants and bases,10 the Ru-NHC catalyzed reaction of 2-oxindole with alcohols
underwent domino dehydrogenation–condensation–reduction-C–H
hydroxylation processes, without the use of any additional oxidant,
in a one pot condition. To the best of our knowledge, the double functionalization
(C–H alkylation and aerobic C–H hydroxylation) at the
α-position of 2-oxindole using a well-defined Ru-NHC catalyst
has not studied in the literature (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Scope of the Present Work
2 Results
and Discussion
We performed the initial optimization for
the α-alkylation
of N,N-dimethylacetamide with benzyl
alcohol using Ru-NHC catalyst as a preferred model reaction. Heating
a toluene solution to 140 °C containing N,N-dimethylacetamide, benzyl alcohol, 0.1–0.5 equiv
of KOtBu, and 1.0 mol % of catalyst 2a results in only benzyl benzoate as the product (Table 1, entries 1–3). Different
conditions were probed for this reaction (Table 1); for example, a decrease in temperature
with a substoichiometric amount of KOtBu results
in a lower conversion and yield of product 1a (Table 1, entries 4 and 5).
Increasing the temperature (140 °C) with a substoichiometric
amount of KOtBu to N,N-dimethylacetamide provided 48% of 1a with complete
conversion of the benzyl alcohol (Table 1, entry 6). Significant improvement was obtained
upon heating the reaction mixture under neat conditions at 90 °C
to afford 1a in 57% yield (Table 1, entry 7). Best optimized conditions were
achieved by heating the reaction mixture under neat conditions at
140 °C to furnish 1a in 71% yield (Table 1, entry 8).

tube for
16 h.

c Neat conditions.

Once the conditions were optimized, we set out to investigate the
reaction scope. A range of Ru-NHC catalysts and alcohols were investigated
under the optimized conditions (Table 2). First, the α-alkylation reaction in the presence
of 1.0 mol % complex 2b afforded the product 1a as the sole product in 56% yield (Table 2, entry 2). Use of Grubbs’ I and II
generation catalysts exhibited considerable conversion of benzyl alcohol
and resulted in respective yields of 47 and 59% of amides isolated
by silica-gel column chromatography purification (Table 2, entries 3 and 4).

a Reaction conditions:
Catalyst (see
Table 2, 1 mol %), benzyl alcohol (1 mmol), N,N-dimethylacetamide (2 mL), and KOtBu (1.3
mmol) were heated at 140 °C for 16 h.

In contrast to the Grubbs’ catalysts, the catalysts 2a and 2b were air stable and did not undergo
any reactivity changes over a long period of time when exposed to
the atmosphere. Next, the same optimized conditions were used for
a range of alcohols for the alkylation of amide to get the respective
α-alkylated products 1b–k in
moderate yield (Scheme 2). The N-acetyl derivatives of pyrrolidine, pyridine,
and morpholine were also successful with benzyl alcohol in the presence
of 1.0 mol % of catalyst 2a, leading to moderate conversion
to give the respective alkylated products 1l–n in 38–48% yields. All products were purified by silica-gel
column chromatography and characterized by spectroscopic techniques.

Reaction
conditions: Complex 2a (0.01 mmol), alcohol (1.0 mmol),
KOtBu
(1.3 mmol), and N,N-dimethylacetamide
(23.0 mmol) were heated at 140 °C in a sealed tube for 16 h.

The scope of this α-alkylation reaction
was extended to 2-oxindole
substrate to give the relevant products, which have potential application
in drugs and also as scaffolds in many alkaloids. Thus, reaction of
2-oxindole and benzyl alcohol was studied and subjected to the optimized
conditions such as catalyst loading, temperature, reaction time, and
base (Figure 2). The
reaction was performed in the presence of various concentrations of
the Ru-NHC catalyst 2a, and it was found that the reaction
with 1.0 mol % catalyst underwent complete conversion of benzyl alcohol.
Lowering the catalyst loading to 0.8, 0.6, and 0.1% led to a decrease
in the conversion of benzyl alcohol. This reaction was also screened
at various temperatures, revealing that performing the reaction at
140–160 °C led to complete conversion of the alcohols.
Upon lowering the temperature from 140 to 80 °C, lower conversion
of the benzyl alcohol was observed. Upon subjecting the reaction to
optimized catalyst loading and temperature conditions, the reaction
was monitored at different time intervals. From these studies, it
was observed that the complete conversion of benzyl alcohol was observed
after heating at 140 °C for 16 h. When the reaction was conducted
under a nitrogen atmosphere in a closed system, it afforded the C3-benzylated
2-oxindole 4a as the sole product in 94% yield.

Figure 2 Reaction profile
of 2-oxindole with benzyl alcohol.

Screening the effect of base for this reaction revealed that
CsF
and Cs2CO3 were inefficient and led to lower
conversion of benzyl alcohol. The use of bases such as K2CO3 and K3PO4 results in better
conversion of the alcohol, and higher conversion was observed in the
case of KOtBu (Figure 2). This reaction was also investigated with various
concentrations of KOtBu (Table 3), which revealed that use of 1.3 equiv of
KOtBu led to product 4a in 94% yield.
Furthermore, this reaction requires an excess of 2-oxindole to get
the product 4a in better yield. Lowering the 2-oxindole
concentration from 2 to 1 equiv led to a decrease in the yield of
the product 4a (Table 3).

a Reaction
conditions: Benzyl alcohol
(1 mmol), 2-oxindole (see table), KOtBu (see table),
and 1 mol % catalyst 2a in toluene were heated in a sealed
tube at 140 °C for 16 h.

Several other alcohols were reacted under these optimized conditions.
Substituted aromatic alcohols reacted smoothly to give the C3-alkylated
2-oxindole 4a–g in very good yields
(Scheme 3). Aliphatic
alcohols were also effective for this C3 alkylation to give the corresponding
products 4h–l in moderate to good
yields, but this required 2 mol % of the Ru-NHC catalyst for better
yields. This reaction with estrone and benzyl alcohol, 4-fluorobenzyl
alcohol, and trifluorobenzyl alcohol afforded the corresponding alkylated
products 4m–o in very good yield.

Scheme 3 Ru-NHC Catalyzed α-Alkylation of 2-Oxindole
Reaction conditions: alcohol
(1 mmol), 2-oxindole (2 mmol), KOtBu (1.3 mmol),
and catalyst 2a (1 mol %) in toluene were heated at 140 °C for
16 h.

We further explored the scope of our
method to develop a one pot
double functionalization process to synthesize quaternary hydroxyl
C3-alkylated 2-oxindole. This will allow rapid access to double functionalized
2-oxindole in one pot. To achieve the one pot C–H alkylation
and subsequent aerobic C–H hydroxylation, a set of conditions
was established after a series of experiments, which included temperature,
time, base concentration, and various catalysts (Table 4). Thus, heating the reaction
mixture of 2-oxindole, benzyl alcohol, catalyst 2a, and
KOtBu in toluene solution at 50, 80, 100, and 140
°C and further exposing to atmospheric air for 24 h at room temperature
afforded the product 5a in 0, 31, 45, and 69% yield (Table 4, entries 1–4),
indicating that higher temperature facilitated the higher conversion
and higher yield of the product 5a. Interestingly, this
reaction (Table 4,
entry 4) afforded quaternary hydroxyl C3-benzylated 2-oxindole 5a (69%) as the major product along with a minor amount (10%)
of the C3-alkylated products. Lowering the amount of 2-oxindole (1
mmol) led to a decrease in the yield of product 5a to
40% (Table 4, entry
5). Furthermore, a gradual decrease in the amount KOtBu from 2.3 to 0 equiv decreases the yield of the product 5a (Table 4, entries 6–10).
It was also observed that decreasing the reaction time led to lowering
the yield of product 5a (Table 4, entries 11 and 12). Decrease in yield of
the product 5a was observed on this reaction while using
other catalysts 2b, Grubbs’ I and Grubbs’
II (Table 4, entries
13–15).

b 2-Oxindole (1 mmol) used.

To expand the scope of this approach, a range of aromatic alcohols
were reacted with 2-oxindole (Scheme 4). Methyl substitution on para/meta to benzyl alcohol
gave similar yields (Scheme 4) of 5b/c (50/45%). In the case
of 2-methoxybenzyl alcohol, a moderate yield of the product 5d (55%) was observed. Methoxy substitution on the meta position
gave 5e in poor yield (25%). Interestingly, a bromo substituent
on the meta position afforded 5f in 53% yield as observed
in the case of ortho/para substituents. Biphenyl methanol gave 5g in 42% yield. Aliphatic alcohols such as butanol, hexanol,
octanol, and iso-amyl alcohol were also reacted to give the respective
quaternary hydroxy C3-alkylated products 5h–j in 35–48% yield (Scheme 4). Next, the effect of N-substitution on
2-oxindole was studied. As a model substrate, N-benzylated 2-oxindole
was prepared and reacted with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic
alcohols. All aliphatic alcohols gave the corresponding product and
did not display any improvement in the yield of the products 5k–n (33–48%, Scheme 4), as observed in the case
of 2-oxindole. Reaction with benzyl alcohol gave 5o in
65% yield. A slight decrease in yield was observed for aromatic alcohols
with ortho/para methoxy/methyl substituents to afford quaternary C3-hydroxy
products 5p–t in 40–57% yields
(Scheme 4). A considerable
decrease in yield of quaternary C3-hydroxy product 5u was observed in the case of meta methylated benzyl alcohol. This
reaction was also successful with biphenyl methanol to give the highly
aromatic ring centered quaternary hydroxylated product 5v (45%). Interestingly, this reaction was functional group tolerant,
upon reaction with 3-bromobenzyl alcohol, to afford the bromo-functionalized
product 5w in 50% yield (Scheme 4). Interestingly, these domino reactions
were also successful with substituted 2-oxindole. Upon reaction of
6-chloro-2-oxindole with benzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, biphenyl
methanol, 1-butanol, and 1-octanol in the presence of Ru-NHC (2a) catalyst afforded the respective products 5a′–e′ in moderate yield (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Ru-NHC Catalyzed
Domino C–H Alkylation and C–H Hydroxylation
of 2-Oxindole
Reaction conditions: Alcohol
(1 mmol), 2-oxindole (2 mmol), KOtBu (1.3 mmol),
and 1 mol % catalyst 2a in toluene were heated at 140
°C for 16 h followed by addition of 1 mmol of KOtBu and kept at rt for 24 h.

The scope of
this domino reaction was also attempted with 1-tetralone
to get α-hydroxy-1-tetralone 7 (Scheme 5). Upon heating the toluene
solution containing benzyl alcohol, 1-tetralone, KOtBu, and 2 mol % of the Ru-NHC catalyst for 24 h, followed by exposure
to air for 24 h, silica-gel column purification afforded the respective
product 7a in 69% yield. Substituted benzyl alcohols
such as 2/3/4-methylbenzyl alcohol, 2/3/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, biphenyl
methanol, and 3-bromobenzyl alcohol also successfully afforded the
appropriate substituted hydroxy functionalized 1-tetralone 7b–i in moderate yield. This approach was also
successfully applied to one of the natural products, estrone, to get
the D-ring functionalization. Estrone was subjected to C–H
alkylation using benzyl alcohol and 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol, and subsequent
aerial oxidation under experimental conditions afforded the respective
quaternary hydroxyl functionalized products 7j and 7k in 38 and 32% yield (Figure 3).

bath.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of β-Hydroxy-1-tetralone
Reaction conditions: alcohol
(1 mmol), ketone (2 mmol), KOtBu (1.3 mmol), and
1 mol % catalyst 2a in toluene were heated at 140 °C
for 16 h followed by addition of 1 mmol of KOtBu
and kept at rt for 24 h.

To demonstrate the
synthetic application of this method, we envisioned
the formal synthesis of Donaxaridine alkaloid. Therefore, domino C–H
alkylation and C–H hydroxylation were directed for the synthesis
of Donaxaridine, a potential therapeutic natural product containing
the quaternary hydroxyl C3-substituted-2-oxindole scaffold. A toluene
reaction mixture containing 2-oxindole, 2-benzyloxy-1-ethanol, KOtBu, and 2.0 mol % of the Ru-NHC catalyst was heated at
140 °C for 24 h and subsequent exposure to air for base-mediated
aerobic C–H hydroxylation
led to the quaternary hydroxyl product 9a in 60% yield
(Scheme 6). Deprotection
of the O-benzyl group under hydrogenation catalyzed
by 5% Pd-C afforded the dihydroxy functionalized product 10 in 90% yield. Selective O-tosylation of the primary
alcohol, followed by the reaction with 6M methylamine in ethanol afforded
the Donaxaridine 11 in 75% yield (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Formal Synthesis of Donaxaridine
On the basis of previous observation,10,12,13 the possible mechanism for the
formation
of the quaternary hydroxyl C3-alkylated 2-oxindole (H) is shown in Scheme 7. Initially, the alcohol (A) forms the aldehyde via
Ru-catalyzed dehydrogenation, which undergoes base-mediated condensation
with 2-oxindole to give the intermediate C. The unsaturated
intermediate C is hydrogenated in the presence of Ru-catalyst
to give the C3-alkyl-2-oxindole intermediate D. Because
the reaction was performed under inert conditions, exclusive formation
of the intermediate D ruled out the water addition across
the Ru–alkoxy intermediate I.12 Allowing the reaction to mix under air generates the intermediates F and G via C–H peroxidation and peroxide
cleavage by enolate13 to afford the product H. The formation of the intermediate G was confirmed
by freezing the crude reaction mixture using liquid N2 followed
by immediate injection into a HRMS instrument, which observed the
mass value of 294.0537, which corresponds to the intermediate G as a potassium adduct. This clearly evidenced that the C–H
hydroxylation is facilitated by atmospheric oxygen.

Scheme 7 Possible Mechanism
for Domino C–H Alkylation and Hydroxylation
3 Conclusions
In summary,
a well-defined air stable Ru-NHC catalyzed domino C–H
alkylation reaction of amides using alcohols was developed. These
reactions proceeded via dehydrogenation–condensation–hydrogenation
steps in a domino manner. A new approach for the tandem C–H
alkylation followed by an aerobic base-mediated C–H hydroxylation
was achieved with a complete atom economical approach. Swapping the
reaction conditions between that under air or inert, the reaction
product can be switched to C–H alkylation or C–H alkylation–hydroxylation.
For the first time, using the borrowing hydrogen approach, a key intermediate
for the Donaxaridine alkaloid was synthesized in good yield directly
from 2-oxindole.

4 Experimental Section
All experiments with Ru-catalyst were carried out under an atmosphere
of nitrogen. All alcohols and amides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
or Alfa-Aesar and stored over molecular sieves. Deuterated solvents
were used as received. All solvents used were dry grade and stored
over 4 Å molecular sieves. Column chromatographic separations
were performed over 100–200 silica gel. Visualization of thin-layer
chromatography was accomplished with UV light and iodine. Ru-NHC 2a and 2b complexes were prepared according to
literature procedures.141H
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker and Jeol
400 and 100 MHz spectrometers. Abbreviations used in the NMR follow-up
experiments: b, broad; s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet;
td, doublet of triplet; dd, double doublet; m, multiplet. High resolution
mass spectra were obtained with a Waters-synapt G2 using electrospray
ionization (ESI). Fourier-transform infrared spectra were obtained
with a Bruker Alpha-E Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer.

of Unactivated Amides (Method A)
Ru-NHC complex (0.01 mmol),
KOtBu (1.3 mmol), alcohol (1 mmol), and N,N-dimethylacetamide (2 mL) were added to an oven-dried
20 mL resealable pressure tube (equipped with rubber septum) under
a N2 atmosphere using a N2 balloon. Then, the
tube was purged with N2 and the septum was quickly removed,
then the tube was sealed with a cap using a crimper. The reaction
mixture was stirred at 140 °C for 16 h. After cooling to room
temperature, mesitylene (1.0 mmol) was added, and the products were
analyzed by GC. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (10 mL)
and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL). The entire ethyl
acetate layer was combined, washed with brine (30 mL), and then dried
over Na2SO4. After concentration under reduced
pressure, the residue was purified by 100–200 mesh silica-gel
column chromatography. (In the case of aliphatic alcohols, 0.02 mmol
of Ru-NHC catalyst was used and heated for 24 h. In the case of cyclic
amides, the reaction was heated for 24 h.)
