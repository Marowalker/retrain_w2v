The
overwhelming interest in supercapacitors has led to the search
for various carbonaceous materials, leading to hierarchical porous
carbons. Herein, we report a natural biomass (tamarind seed)-based
hierarchical porous carbon without any template and activated by a
facile scheme. The tamarind seed coat-based hierarchical porous carbon
possessed a unique configuration, making the material exhibit superior
supercapacitor properties. A single carbon fiber hosting a distinctive
micro- and mesoporous structure formed a connecting thread between
the pores. This unique structure enabled high surface area and high
capacitance. The highest surface area obtained by this method was
1702 m2 g–1, whereas the capacitance
was 157 F g–1 in 6 M KOH. Further, an ionic liquid-based
electrolyte revealed 78 F g–1 at a current density
of 0.5 A g–1. Outstanding capacity retentions of
96 and 93% were obtained over 1000 cycles at a current density of
2 A g–1 for aqueous (6 M KOH) and ionic liquid (1-butyl
3-methyl imidazoliumbistrifluorosulfonylimide) electrolytes, respectively.
The high charge-storage ability of the porous carbon microfibers (PCMFs)
can be ascribed to the coexistence of micro- and mesopores. The power
characteristics and the cyclic stability of PCMF materials were appealing
in both electrolytes. The synthesis process described is amenable
for large-scale applications with less complexity.

Introduction
Serious environmental
and energy crisis has led to an enhanced
development of green energy storage.1 Supercapacitors
(SCs) or electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are high-capacitance
commercial secondary energy storage systems with a well-known power
density.2 Numerous types of materials have
been studied for SCs.3−7 High-surface-area carbons with excellent electrical conductivity
are usually employed as SC electrode materials. These materials exhibited
a high electrochemical capacitance but poor rate capability owing
to inadequate ionic diffusion and charge-transfer resistance inside
the tortuous pores. Therefore, the quest to achieve a high capacitance
with novel porous carbon materials with modified and improved morphology
is ongoing, and a high power density with capacity retention has not
been punctuated to date.

Paving the way to novel morphologies
was the advent of hierarchical
porous carbon (HPC), considered to be one of the ideal electrode materials
for SCs because of their three-dimensional (3D) porous channels with
a well-balanced micro-, meso-, and macroporous structure.8 HPCs are widely synthesized from resorcinol–formaldehyde,9 polystyrene,10 polypyrrole,11 sucrose,12 fructose,13 glucose,14 and cellulose15 by template method. Furthermore, the existing
template method mostly employs expensive, synthetic, and nongreen
route precursor materials along with surfactants that are nonrenewable.

To circumvent these issues, biomass and its derivatives such as
cotton,16Metaplexis japonica,17Cyclosorus interruptus,18 cotton, hardwood, softwood, bamboo,19 rice straw, soybean stalk, wheat straw, corn
stalk, rice straw, cotton stalk, and peanut shell20 were introduced as precursors for the HPCs. Exemplary synthesis
strategies have been reported with these types of biomass precursors
to achieve a desired morphology and a well-defined porosity. All the
aforementioned carbon materials have been reported to possess a high
capacity in electrochemical devices owing to the microporous and mesoporous
tuning.16−22

To highlight a few such materials with high capacity; Tian
et al.
developed an HPC derived from bamboo by a hydrothermal method, and
the optimized sample exhibited a maximum surface area of 1472 m2 g–1 and a capacitance of 148 F g–1 at a current density of 0.1 A g–1 in 6 M KOH.23 An interconnected channel like HPC aerogel has
been obtained from bagasse by the freeze-drying method and has a maximum
surface area of 1892 m2 g–1 and exhibits
a high capacitance of 142 F g–1 at a current density
of 0.5 A g–1.8 Later,
Peng et al. developed a loose porous structured carbon with a well-developed
porosity derived from a mixture of sewage sludge and coconut shell
as the precursor materials by the hydrothermal method to obtain a
super-HPC, which had a surface area of 3003 m2 g–1, presenting a capacitance value of 62 F g–1 at
a current density of 0.5 A g–1 in a 6 M KOH.24 Recently, Fierro et al. reported an application
of tannin-related polyphenol-derived HPCs as SC electrode materials
with an excellent capacitance performance (277 F g–1 at 0.5 mV s–1 in a three-electrode system), demonstrating
a good feasibility to utilize tannin polyphenols to synthesize carbon
materials with high electrochemical activity.25 It should be emphasized here that a hard template route employing
SBA-15 was adopted in the work of Fierro et al.. All the aforementioned
materials exhibit high surface area as well as high specific capacitance.
However, the synthetic procedure requires rigorous route, which becomes
not conducive for large scale.

The efficiency of polyphenols
as precursors in achieving a HPC
is evident from the number of studies reported so far.26−30 Hence, a natural biomass rich in polyphenols with an inherent template
was hypothesized to lead to a HPC. Tannin-rich tamarind seed (Tamarindus indica L) largely available in India,
Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Philippines posed as a candidate
material.31 The tamarind seed comprises
carbon (∼51.7%), nitrogen (∼35.5%), and oxygen (∼12.4%).31 The whole tamarind seed contains 70% of kernel
(white color) and 30% seed coat or testa (brown).32 The seed kernel consists of proteins and polysaccharides
widely employed in pet food, textile, mining, and pharmaceutical industries.
The seed coat consists of a high portion of fibers, tannin (30–40%),
and dyeing matters which are unsuitable for the food industry. Large
quantities of seed coat are obtained from the food industry during
the separation process, which are discarded as biowaste.

These
generally discarded seed coats possess two salient features
making them unique as a precursor. First, tannin contains polyphenolic
compounds (phloroglucinol, gallic acid, and catechin) of high molecular
weight (about 500–3000), and it is soluble in water and becomes
the source of carbon.32 Second, the crude
fiber contains a lignocellulose highly stable till 300 °C under
hydrothermal conditions.33 Therefore, the
fibrous structure is expected to be retained even after the hydrothermal
process, allowing them to act as a self-template for the formation
of microfibers. The particular chemical composition and microstructure
of the tamarind seed coat can be utilized to form a hierarchical PCMF
without using templates and catalysts by the hydrothermal method.
Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of a hierarchical PCMF using
tamarind seed by the hydrothermal method. The synthesis strategy to
form hierarchical PCMFs from the seed coat is schematically illustrated
in Figure 1. This process
of making HPC microfibers is simple, economical, and can be easily
scaled up. The tuning of micro- and mesopores on the mechanically
stable microfibers is essential for electrode applications.

Figure 1 Schematic of
hierarchical PCMFs synthesized from tamarind seed
coat.

Results and Discussion
The macroscopic
image of an untreated tamarind seed coat is shown
in Figure 2a. The seed
coat covers the kernel from any mechanical damage, and the brown-colored
seed coat evinces the tannin-rich surface. In Figure 2b, an electron microscopic view of the cross
section of the seed coat reinforced with numerous interconnected fibers
is shown. In general, these fibers that possess a high amount of lignocellulose
content after subjecting to hydrothermal treatment were labeled as
MF-250, and the resulting morphology in Figure 2c clearly depicts the retainment of the fibrous
nature. Further, a high-temperature carbonization at 800 °C yielded
distinct strands of fibers, as seen in Figure 2d, labeled as CMF-800.

Figure 2 (a) Photograph of a seed
coat, (b) SEM cross-sectional image of
seed coat, SEM image of (c) MF-250 and (d) FESEM of CMF-800.

The porosity can be tuned on the
hierarchical structure by chemical
activation using KOH. The effect of KOH concentration on porosity
was studied. In Figure S1a–c, the
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the
carbon microfibers which were chemically activated are shown. The
fibrous structure was retained after chemical activation, which indicates
that the carbonized microfibers were thermally stable. The pores on
the sphere surface were observed with an increase in KOH concentration.
The chemically activated sample has been labeled as PCMF-x (porous carbon microfibers), where x is KOH weight
ratio.

The samples MF-250 and CMF-800 were further characterized
using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area electron
diffraction (SAED) patterns, as shown in Figure 3, to study the change in morphology and their
crystallinity. The TEM analysis of both MF-250 (Figure 3a,b) and CMF-800 (Figure 3d,e) revealed an interconnected network of
polygonal nanograins.34,35 The average size of the grain
was found to be ca. 50 nm. The grains connected to form the fiber
undulated with more such grains at irregular intervals in a 3D framework.
The SEAD pattern of MF-250 (Figure 3c) was found to be typical of an amorphous material.
However, a careful observation of CMF-800 (Figure 3f) revealed three lean diffraction rings
around a central bright zone. The SAED pattern evinced the presence
of two phases, an ordered phase and a disordered phase, typical of
a dual-nature carbon.36

Figure 3 TEM images of MF-250
(a,b) and CMF-800 (d,e); SAED patterns of
MF-250 (c) and CMF-800 (f).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractograms revealed an amorphous
structure of MF-250 with characteristic broad peaks at 2θ values
of 15° and 22°, as presented in Figure S2.37 The heat (carbonized)-treated
sample exhibited the presence of graphitic planes (002) at 23°
and (100) at 43°, evincing complete carbonization. The XRD results
are in good coherence with the SAED pattern. These results indicated
that prior to heat treatment the high lignocellulose content dominated
the amorphous nature in the sample.38 On
treatment with concd KOH, the graphitic nature of the sample reduced
and the amorphous nature was pronounced, as indicated by the broad
peak at 23° in the diffractograms for PCMF-1 to PCMF-3 seen in Figure S2. The broadening of the peak increased
with an increasing concentration of KOH. This could be attributed
to the strong etching effect by KOH over carbon.38,39 This etching can produce a significant disorder over the graphitic
phase, thereby increasing the functionalities as well as the porous
nature of the substrate.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
curves are used to study
the pore characteristics of all the samples. For all of the PCMF samples,
type IV isotherm exhibiting H3-type hysteresis loops indicates the
presence of micro- and mesoporous structures, as shown in Figure 4a.40 Moreover, the presence of macropores is indicated as inferred
from the sharp increase in the N2 uptake from the isotherm
at high relative pressures (P/P0 > 0.9). For the samples treated with KOH, the adsorption
studies revealed that the surface area increases with an increase
in KOH concentration (Figure 5). The carbonized fibers exhibited 26% of mesopores because
of the space between the interconnected polygonal nanograins. From Figure 5, the influence of
chemical activation on the percentage of micro- and mesopores was
also studied. The increase in the concentration of KOH increases the
percentage of mesopores that are essential to achieve high specific
capacitance.

Figure 4 (a) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and
(b) pore-size
distribution.

Figure 5 Influence of KOH concentration
on the surface area and the percentage
of micropores and mesopores.

The abundance of micropore and mesopore surface area is enhanced
as a function of KOH concentration and is tabulated in Table 1. The PCMF-3 sample recorded
the highest surface area of 1702 m2 g–1 with 72 and 28% of micropores and mesopores, respectively. The optimization
of mesopores and micropores is important for supercapacitors to achieve
high specific capacitance and high capacity retention. The density
functional theory method is used to analyze the pore size distribution
and is given in Figure 4b. From Figure 4b,
large pore volume in the microporous (about 1.7 nm) region and less
pore volume in the mesoporous (about 2.3–10 nm) region were
observed. The presence of micropores can effectively enhance the diffusion
and mobility of the electrolyte ions to the interior of the electrode
and increase the rate capability, whereas the mesopores can accommodate
more electrolytes which can effectively enhance the specific capacitance.40,41

Electrochemical Performance
Electrochemical
characterizations
were performed in both aqueous and ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes
to understand the influence of ion size on the pore size of the electrode. Figure 6a shows the cyclic
voltammogram of the carbonized and chemically activated samples in
6 M KOH electrolyte. A characteristic rectangular voltammogram confirmed
the EDLC capability of the samples. As anticipated from the surface
area data, the material with maximum surface area (PCMF-3; 1702 m2 g–1) exhibited the highest capacitance.
The order of capacitance followed the trend observed for the surface
area. All the chemically activated samples showed higher capacitance
compared to the only carbonized sample (CMF-800). Another significant
observation was the marginal reduction in the stable potential window
in the activated samples compared to CMF-800.

Figure 6 (a) CV curves of PCMF
electrodes at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in 6 M KOH
electrolyte and (b) specific capacitance of PCMFs at
various scan rates.

The effect of scan rate
on the cycling as well as capacitive behavior
of each sample is provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). The results were in line with the other results. A
comparative plot showing the effect of scan rate on each sample is
shown in Figure 6b.
Typical to such samples, a gradual drop in capacity was observed with
an increasing scan rate. However a very high capacity of approximately
100 F g–1 at 200 mV s–1 was retained
for PCMF-3.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) studies of
these PCMF electrodes
in a symmetric cell further confirmed the high capacitive behavior.
The charging and discharging were done in a potential window, that
is, the same as that of the CV test, as shown in Figure 7. The PCMF electrode had nearly
linear and symmetrical GCD curves, clearly indicating the superior
electric double-layer capacitance characteristic and electrochemical
reversibility, as well as the fast charge/discharge behavior, as shown
in Figure 7a.

of PCMF electrodes at a current density of 0.5 A
g–1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, (b) GCD curves ofPCMF-3
at various current densities, and (c) specific capacitance of PCMFs
at different specific currents.

However, the chemically activated samples had an apparently
extended
discharge time than the carbonized sample, indicating that chemical
activation presents a much higher capacitance. The GCD curves of the
PCMF-3 electrode are shown in Figure 7b. The individual GCD curves of the other PCMF electrodes
are shown in Figure S4. The curves are
almost linear and symmetrical, showing a perfect capacitive behavior.
At a current density of 5 A g–1, there is a negligible
drop in cell voltage, which can be ascribed to the presence of micropores
on the one-dimensional structure, permitting quick electron and ion
transfers, which is in agreement with the CV tests. The specific capacitance
of the PCMFs has been measured at various current densities and is
shown in Figure 7c.

The applications of aqueous electrolyte systems are restricted
in terms of energy density as compared to batteries because of their
narrow working voltage window (1 V). The energy density of the system
can be improved by the change of an aqueous electrolyte to an IL electrolyte,
which has an operating potential of more than 3.5 V. The choice of
1-butyl 3-methyl imidazoliumbistrifluorosulfonylimide (BmIm-TFSI)
as an IL was based on its potential window range from 0 to 3.5 V.
Also, the selection of the bulky anion in the electrolyte was to understand
the influence of electrolyte ion size on the pore size of the electrode.

The cyclic voltammograms in an IL electrolyte exhibited typical
rectangular profiles for all the samples and are shown in Figure 8. However, the chemically
modified electrode (PCMFs) showed a pronounced increase in pore size
evincing increased capacitance. As expected, with an increment in
surface area, the specific capacitance also increased. However, the
increase in capacitance value between PCMF-2 and PCMF-3 was significantly
high.

Figure 8 (a) CV curves of PCMF electrodes at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in an IL electrolyte and (b) specific capacitance of PCMFs at various
scan rates.

The effect of scan rate
on the cycling as well as capacitive behavior
of each sample is provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). At higher scan rates, the voltammograms reflected a
pseudocapacitance behavior. Also, one significant attribute of the
voltammograms in IL was their lower current density compared to their
aqueous counterpart, which can be due to the lower conductivity of
IL, especially with the TFSI anions.

GCD was conducted at various
current densities of 0.5–5
A g–1 to evaluate the retention capacity and is
shown in Figure 9a.
The electrodes exhibited a linear voltage response with respect to
time while charging and discharging. The specific capacitance (Figure 9b) of PCMF-3 was
calculated to be 76 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1, and the retention ratios were about 78% for a scan rate of 5 A
g–1, which are listed in Table 2. The GCD curves for the other samples are
shown in Figure S6. From Figure 9c, the specific capacitance
of PCMF-3 was observed to be higher than that of the other samples,
which agrees well with the CV results. The specific capacitance values
of the tamarind seed coat-derived HPC are comparable with those of
the other biomass-derived carbon electrodes and are listed in Table 3.

Considering the capacitance
of PCMF-3 in an aqueous electrolyte,
it was evident that the surface area was the only parameter controlling
the specific capacitance. However, in case of IL-based systems, the
anomalous behavior observed between PCMF-2 and PCMF-3 could be reasoned
based on the ionic size of the electrolyte. For instance, in case
of BmIm-TFSI, the ionic size was calculated to be around 0.74 nm.
The huge ionic size requires larger pores for a higher capacitance.
The pores with sizes in the range of 0.5–1.5 nm do not provide
free access for the ions into the interior portion of the electrode.
A pore size more than 1.5 nm is essential for the free access of IL.
PCMF-3, which has 34% of its micropores in the range of 1.5–2.5
nm, becomes highly suitable for the IL electrolyte. The other samples
exhibit lower capacitance not only because of the lower surface area
but also because of the lack of sufficient pores with the size in
the range of 1.5–2.5 nm.

The cyclic stability is one
of the key factors for the SC device
application. The cyclic stability of the PCMF-3 electrode has been
performed in both 6 M KOH and the BmIm-TFSI electrolyte over upto
1000 cycles. After 1000 cycles of consecutive charge/discharge at
2 A g–1 (Figure 10a), the specific capacitance of the PCMF-3 electrode
was maintained to be 136 F g–1 for 6 M KOH and 59
F g–1 for BmIm-TFSI, which corresponds to 96 and
93% of its initial value. The PCMF-3 electrode shows a good cyclic
stability in both the electrolytes.

Figure 10 (a) Long-term cyclic stability test of
the PCMF-3 electrode at
a current density of 2 A g–1 in both 6 M KOH and
BmIm-TFSI and (b) power characteristics of PCMF-3 in comparison with
the other reported samples.

The PCMF-based symmetric SCs were calculated for its energy
density
and power density. The calculated values were plotted in comparison
with the other notable reported biomass-derived carbons and are shown
in Figure 10b. In
an aqueous system, the energy density of PCMFs ranges from 10.7 to
21.1 W h kg–1 at 0.5 A g–1. The
PCMF-3 electrode still retains an energy density of 13.4 W h kg–1 with a high power density of 4.3 W kg–1. The achieved energy density values are similar to the reported
values for HPC derived from bagasse,8 rice
husk,42 corn cob,43 human hair,44 potato starch,45 sugarcane waste,46 and coffee ground.47 The maximum energy
density of the PCMF-3 electrode in BmIm-TFSI was found to be 119.2
W h kg–1 at a power density of 1680 W kg–1, which is much greater than that in 6 M KOH (21.1 W h kg–1 at 491 W kg–1). These results show that PCMFs
derived from the tamarind seed coat are favorable materials for high-performance
SCs with large power and energy densities.

The rationale behind
these superior properties can be attributed
to the material structure and composition increasing the mechanical
stability as well as electronic conductivity through their fibrous
pathway. The 3D fibrous structure seen from the electron microscopic
results show interconnected polygonal particles which can provide
a low-resistance pathway for the electron transfer. Further, the void
space between the polygonal particles allows more volume for the electrolyte,
which can lower the ion transfer resistance. This combination of the
hierarchical structure with the partial graphitic nature identified
by XRD, in corroboration with the micro–mesopore data, is favorable
for SC electrode applications. The high rate capability makes this
material suitable for high-power SC applications.

Conclusions
The synthesis of hierarchical PCMFs was reported. The raw materials
chosen for HPC are easily available and the making process is amenable
for large-scale production. The criterion for choosing these materials
is their higher polyphenol content. Tamarind seed coats were used
as the carbon precursor, which forms the natural template to facilitate
the formation of well-structured carbon microfibers, without any expensive
surfactants. The effect of the chemical activating agent concentration
on the specific surface area and porosity was carefully studied. The
highest surface area was obtained for the sample treated with a concentration
of 3 (KOH) at 800 °C. The synthesized PCMF-3 possesses superior
capacitance in both 6 M KOH and BmIm-TFSI electrolytes with excellent
cyclic stability. High specific capacitances of 157 F g–1 in 6 M KOH and 76 F g–1 in BmIm-TSFI at a current
density of 0.5 A g–1 are achieved. With the large
voltage offered by the IL electrolyte, the PCMF-3 electrode can store/release
high maximum energy of 119.2 W h kg–1 at a power
density of 1.68 kW kg–1. These findings suggest
that the pore size between 1.5 and 2.5 nm is essential to obtain a
high specific capacitance in an IL electrolyte, which has a bulky
anion like TFSI. The well-developed porous structure on the carbon
microfibers was found to be the key factor for enhancement in the
SC performance. A mere increase in microporosity would not contribute
to the increase in capacitance as well as retention capacity. The
work reported here provides an attractive route for the production
of microstructural carbon materials through the transformation of
low cost, abundant, and renewable biomass for SC electrode applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Export quality tamarind seeds were procured
as samples from a reliable vendor at Chennai, India. All other chemicals
were utilized without purification. Deionized water was used throughout
the experiments.

Material Preparation
Tamarind seeds
were procured from
a local market in Chennai, India. The tamarind seeds were cleaned
and washed with deionized water until the filtrate was clear. The
tamarind seeds were subjected to a preparatory method as described
elsewhere.48 Briefly, 2 g of the seed coat
powder dispersed in 60 mL of deionized water was hydrothermally carbonized
at 250 °C. Later, it was subjected to high-temperature carbonization
to obtain a carbon microfiber.

In this research, we have activated
the carbonized fiber using a facile scheme, wherein the carbonized
fiber was mixed with KOH in the weight ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3
in deionized water and stirred continuously. The resultant mixture
was dried at 100 °C and then activated at 800 °C for 1 h
in the flow of argon gas at a ramp rate of 5 °C min–1. The final product was washed with deionized water several times
and dried at 100 °C. The chemically activated sample has been
labeled as PCMF-x (PCMFs), where x is the KOH weight ratio.

Characterization
The morphology
of the prepared samples
was characterized by SEM (Hitachi S-4800). The FESEM images were obtained
with Carl Zeiss Merlin FESEM at an operating voltage of 5 kV. The
TEM images were obtained on a FEI Tecnai G2 microscope, and the samples
were dispersed in ethanol and dropped on a copper grid. The XRD patterns
were recorded on a Rigaku-SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV, 30 mA. The
data were collected from 10° to 90° with the scan rate of
30 min–1 and steps of 0.02. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurements of the samples were carried out at −196 °C,
and the surface area (SBET) values were
calculated using the standard Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The total pore volume (Vtotal) of the samples was calculated at the
maximum relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.995. The micropore (Vmicro) and mesopore (Vmeso) volumes were calculated
using the Dubinin–Radushkevich analysis.

Electrochemical
Characterization in 6 M KOH
The electrode
was prepared by mixing active carbon materials, acetylene black, and
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) in a weight ratio of 10:1:1 in 1-propanol
to obtain a paste. The paste was then pressed onto a Ni mesh area
of 1 cm2 and air-dried at 80 °C for 12 h. A two-electrode
cell for SC application has been assembled by taking two identical
electrodes made from the hierarchical PCMFs derived from the tamarind
seed coat, separated using a polypropylene membrane, and nickel mesh
was used as the current collector, which was clipped between two poly(ethylene
terephthalate) plates.

Electrochemical Characterization in IL
To measure the
symmetric SC using the IL electrolyte, the electrodes have been prepared
by spray-coating the slurry containing active materials, conducting
carbon, and binder in the ratio of 10:1:1 on an aluminum current collector.
Two identical electrodes were separated by a polypropylene separator
soaked in the BmIm-TFSI electrolyte in a HS-type cell.

The cyclic
voltammetry and GCD tests were conducted using a Solartron (Model-1400)
electrochemical workstation in 6 M KOH and BmIm-TFSI to evaluate the
capacitance performance. The specific capacitance (C) of a symmetric capacitor has been calculated using the following
equation43 1  where, “I”
is the discharge current (A), “ΔV”
is the change in voltage within the discharge time (V), “Δt” is the discharge time (s), and “m” is the mass of each electrode (g). The energy
density and power density of the symmetrical SC have been calculated
from the following equation43 2   3  where “V” is
the discharge voltage (V) and “Δt”
is the discharging time (h).
