Ab
initio molecular orbital calculations were carried out to examine
the redox potentials of 149 electrolyte additives for lithium-ion
batteries. These potentials were employed to construct regression
models using a machine learning approach. We chose simple descriptors
based on the chemical structure of the additive molecules. The descriptors
predicted the redox potentials well, in particular, the oxidation
potentials. We found that the redox potentials can be explained by
a small number of features, which improve the interpretability of
the results and seem to be related to the amplitude of the eigenstate
of the frontier orbitals.

==== Body
Introduction
In the almost 30-year
history of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),
the cathode and anode active materials have captured the spotlight
in the development of LIBs because their combination sets the upper
limits of the voltage and capacity of the cell.1−4 Electrolytes probably rank second
in importance to the cathode and anode active materials. It is worth
noting that, in recent years, ultrahigh salt concentration electrolytes5 and solid-state electrolytes6 have become hot topics in the study of LIBs. In comparison
with these major components, the electrolyte additives have a modest
supporting role. However, after the significant development history
of LIBs, we are now reaching the performance limits of the leading
types of LIBs. Silicon anodes, high nickel cathodes, and lithium-rich
cathodes are considered to be promising next-generation active materials
because their theoretical capacities are higher than those of currently
used materials, and, thus, they have been intensively studied.7−9 However, they still have some unresolved issues such as poor cyclability
and low-rate performance. Therefore, it will take some time to put
these materials into practical use. It is expected that the use of
additives may change this situation without greatly changing the cell
design; thus, they have gradually attracted attention as a low-cost
way to improve cell performance.

In a recent review, Haregewoin
et al. discussed in detail the state-of-the-art
research into electrolyte additives for LIBs,10 and that paper constitutes the most thorough report on the current
state of additive research in the field of LIBs. They classified electrolyte
additives into four categories: (i) anode additives, (ii) cathode
additives, (iii) redox shuttles that prevent the cell from overcharging,
and (iv) flame retardants; they made a detailed exposition of these
four categories. For example, in the case of the cathode additives,
various cathodes such as lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2),
lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide [LiNixMnyCozO2 (x + y + z = 1)], Li-rich lithium manganite (Li2MnO3), manganese spinel
(LiMn2O4), and olivine (LiFePO4)
were discussed. Some figures in their paper show that the improvement
in the performance indicators, such as the Coulombic efficiency, achieved
by additives has stagnated for years. This fact suggests the difficulty
in designing suitable additives by conventional chemical intuition
and experimental trial-and-error approaches. Thus, in addition to
the steady efforts based on the existing methods of materials science,
an alternative approach is required to accelerate the development
of these additives. Thus, it is interesting that the number of studies
categorized into materials informatics (MI) has increased.11−15 MI takes advantage of the sophisticated machine learning techniques
developed in data science to reveal useful and sometimes hidden relationships
between various properties of materials. MI is a data-driven approach
to materials science, and it is expected to become the fourth approach
in material research after experimentation, theory, and computer simulation.

We believe that it would be useful to identify the relationships
between the structures of the additives developed so far and the properties
that allow their use as additives. Among the various properties of
additives, redox potentials are suitable for such a purpose. The potential
at which a molecule is electrochemically decomposed in the positive
or negative electrode is one of the fundamental values in the design
of additives. This is because the mechanism by which additives work
is electrochemical decomposition, followed by the formation of a film
on the electrode surface. Besides the practical importance of the
redox potentials in designing additives, they are computationally
tractable and comparably reliable, using current quantum chemistry
methodologies.

In this study, ab initio molecular orbital methods
were used to
calculate the redox potentials of additives discussed elsewhere.10,16,17 The calculated potentials were
used as the explained variables of a regression model. We designed
features, that is, explanatory variables of the regression model,
on the basis of the chemical structures. In spite of the simplicity
of the designed features, they reproduced the redox potentials considerably
well, in particular, the oxidation potentials. As will be explained
later, the discrepancies in the reduction potentials between the ab
initio calculations and the predictions by the regression models seem
to be due to the decomposition of the additives in the reduced state.

Results
and Discussion
Redox Potentials of the Additives
First, we examined
the redox potentials of 149 electrolyte additives for LIBs. The calculated
results are shown in Figure 1 and are classified into four groups according to their intended
use: anode additives, cathode additives, redox shuttles, and flame
retardants. Note that the molecular formula, chemical structure, CAS
registry number, CAS name, oxidation potential, and reduction potential
of all additives calculated in this paper are listed in spreadsheet
S1, which is attached as the Supporting Information. The sources of these additives are refs10,16 and (17). The classification of Figure 1 conforms mainly
to ref (10). Note that
this classification is somewhat expedient because the additives are
not uniquely classified into the four types. In fact, some molecules,
such as those containing sulfur, work as additives for both the cathode
and the anode because the reduction potential of sulfur-containing
additives is usually high, and they are easily decomposed on the anode
surface, whereas a part of the decomposition product reaches the cathode
to form a film on its surface.

Figure 1 Calculated results of the oxidation vs
reduction potential of 149
additives (electronvolts). Blue, yellow, purple, and red circles represent
the potentials of the anode additives, cathode additives, redox shuttles,
and flame retardants, respectively.

We found that there was no clear relationship between the
oxidation
and reduction potentials. However, the anode additives seem to be
divided into two groups by taking 1 V (vs Li/Li+) as a
threshold: 49% of the total anode additives have reduction potentials
of 1 V (vs Li/Li+) or less, whereas 51% of the anode additives
have reduction potentials of more than 1 V (vs Li/Li+).
Anode additives that have a high reduction potential of 1.5 V (vs
Li/Li+) or more are more easily reduced than carbonate
solvent molecules. Conversely, there are quite a few anode additives
for which reduction is difficult because of their low reduction potential
of around 0 V (vs Li/Li+). In addition, most anode additives
(94%) have oxidation potentials of 5 V (vs Li/Li+) or more,
and their oxidation at the cathode is challenging.

Figure 1 also shows
that a large number of cathode additives (61%) have oxidation potentials
of 5 V (vs Li/Li+) or less. They are easily oxidized at
the cathode, but their reduction at the anode is difficult because
of their low reduction potential. We also found a group of cathode
additives that are not easily oxidized at the cathode because of their
very high oxidation potential of 7 V (vs Li/Li+) or more.
It is noteworthy that the oxidation potentials of the redox shuttles
are concentrated around 4 V (vs Li/Li+) and are close to
the operating potential of the cathodes. This is consistent with one
of the design requirements for redox shuttles and represents an indirect
confirmation of the calculation accuracy. The redox potentials of
flame retardant additives are scattered in Figure 1. The presence of phosphorus, which is usually
present in these additives, does not seem to provide a clear relationship
between the oxidation and reduction potentials.

Feature Design
of the Additives
To establish a regression
model between the structures of the additives and their redox potentials,
it is necessary to determine the features that correctly describe
the structures of the additives. Although molecular fingerprints such
as MACCS and FP4 are standard methods for describing the partial structures
of molecules in the fields of cheminformatics and bioinformatics,18 such a general-purpose method requires a large
data set to obtain the regression model; therefore, it may not be
suitable for a relatively small-scale study such as ours. Thus, we
determined features to describe the structure of the additives simply,
as described in the following paragraph.

(i) For each element,
other than hydrogen, in an additive molecule, we counted the number
of atoms having the same coordination number. For example, in the
case of the left-hand molecule in Figure 2, there are two bidentate oxygen atoms, one
monodentate oxygen atom, and three tricoordinate carbon atoms and
are counted as O2 → 2, O1 → 1, and C3 → 3, respectively.
Similarly, in the case of the right-hand molecule in Figure 2, there are two tetracoordinate
carbon atoms, two bidentate oxygen atoms, four monodentate oxygen
atoms, and two tetracoordinate sulfur atoms and are counted as C4
→ 2, O2 → 2, O1 → 4, and S4 → 2, respectively.

Figure 2 Examples
of designed molecular features: 1,3-dioxol-2-one (left)
and 1,5,2,4-dioxadithiane 2,2,4,4-tetraoxide (right).

(ii) Count the number of five-membered (R5) and
six-membered rings
(R6) included in the additive. They are R5 → 1 and R6 →
1 in the left- and right-hand molecules in Figure 2, respectively.

(iii) If the neutral
state is a radical, set a flag such as rad
→ 1 and rad → 0 for radical and nonradical, respectively.

In this way, the structure of the additive molecule is distinguished
by a total of 22 features. We are aware that the above feature design
has some limitations, for example, geometric isomers cannot be distinguished
(e.g., Id [3–5] in spreadsheet S1, Supporting Information). Nonetheless, as will be seen later, the difference
in the molecular structures and the nature of redox potentials are
fairly well-captured by these features. These features and the redox
potentials correspond to the explanatory and explained variables of
a regression model, respectively. These values are listed in spreadsheet
S1, Supporting Information, together with
the total energy of the additives and the total energy of their oxidized
and reduced states.

Prediction of Redox Potentials by Machine
Learning Approaches
By using the above defined structural
features and combining the
Gaussian kernel ridge regression (GKRR) and gradient boosting regression
(GBR) methods, we predicted the oxidation and reduction potentials
of the additives. First, an explanation of the detailed settings of
the GKRR method is given. The data (features and redox potentials)
were standardized because, if the variance of a certain feature is
significantly larger than that of the other features, there is a possibility
of it dominating the objective function; in addition, it is possible
that the estimator might not correctly learn from other features as
expected. Note that although the standardization of data is not necessary
for the GBR method because of its scale-invariance character, we also
standardized its data to facilitate comparison with the results of
the GKRR method. A total of 149 data were randomly divided into two:
three-quarters of the data were grouped as the training data and the
remaining one-quarter as the test data. This division was also applied
to the GBR model. We used k-fold cross-validation,
where the training data set is divided into k-subsets,
and the holdout method is repeated k times. In each case, one of the k-subsets is used as the test set and the other (k – 1)-subsets are grouped together to form the training
set. The mean score over k trials is then calculated.
We set k = 5 and used the coefficient of determination, R2, to score the model fitness. Two hyperparameters
(α and γ) in GKRR were optimized in exponential grids
of 50 points between 10–2 and 1 and 50 points between
10–3 and 10–1, for α and
γ, respectively.

We now discuss the detailed settings
of the GBR method. We used the least-squares regression as the loss
function (loss = “ls”). The learning rate at which the
contribution of each decision tree shrinks and the number of boosting
stages to perform were set in a very conservative way to avoid overfitting
(learning rate = 0.0001 and n_estimators = 100 000).
In addition, the maximum depth, minimum sample split, and maximum
feature parameters of the scikit-learn gradient-boosting regression
module (ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor) were set as 6, 3, and
2, respectively.

Figure 3 shows the
results of the learning and prediction of the oxidation potentials
by the GKRR and GBR methods. As a visual aid, we also show the 45°
line that represents the perfect fitting of the regression model.
We found that although both methods fit fairly well with the training
data (the R2 scores for GKRR and GBR are
0.868 and 0.992, respectively), the predictions with respect to the
test data by GKRR are somewhat scattered, and the fitness is not as
high as that observed in the GBR model. This can also be recognized
from the fact that the R2 score of GBR
with respect to the test data is 0.851, whereas that of GKRR is 0.801.

regression models with standardized data: GKRR with optimized hyperparameters,
α = 0.0954 and γ = 0.0222 (top), and GBR (bottom). Blue
and red circles correspond to the training data and test data, respectively.
Note that the axes are standardized.

Figure 4 shows
the
results of the learning and prediction of the reduction potentials
by the GKRR and GBR methods. We found that GKRR is not so well-adapted,
even to the training data. The R2 score
of GBR is 0.985, whereas that of GKRR is 0.804. Moreover, in comparison
with the oxidation potentials, both GKRR and GBR models predict the
reduction potentials poorly with respect to the test data. This is
indicated by the R2 scores of 0.512 and
0.643 for GKRR and GBR, respectively. In fact, it seems that the two
outliers designated by arrows 1 and 2 in Figure 4 reduce the accuracy of the predictions with
respect to the test data in the GBR method.

Figure 4 Machine learning and
prediction of reduction potentials by two
regression models with standardized data: GKRR with optimized hyperparameters,
α = 0.0868 and γ = 0.0152 (top), and GBR with two outliers,
designated by arrows (bottom). Blue and red circles correspond to
the training data and test data, respectively. Note that the axes
are standardized.

We then examined the
two outliers in detail. The top part of Figure 5 shows the optimized
geometries of the neutral and reduced states of carbonic acid, methyl-2-propen-1-yl
ester (Id [19] in spreadsheet S1, Supporting Information) and the bottom part shows those of 2(3H)-furanone,
3-bromodihydro- (Id [41]). The former and the latter correspond to
arrows 1 and 2 in Figure 4, respectively. It is noteworthy that one chemical bond is
broken in the reduced state of both molecules. The reduced state of
Id [19] contains the allyl radical and the methyl carbonate anion.
They are significantly stabilized through resonance, as shown by the
contributing structures of these species in the figure. In addition,
the reduced state of Id [41] shows that the C–Br bond is broken
and a bromide ion is formed in solution. The structures of these reduced
states are not consistent with the original feature design based on
coordination numbers; this inconsistency resulted in relatively poor
prediction of reduction potentials. Note that, in general, chemical
bonds are more easily broken in the reduced state than in the oxidized
state because, in the reduced state, an excess electron is present
in an antibonding orbital, which causes the bond to be elongated or
cleaved to mitigate the enhanced electron repulsion arising from the
excess electrons. In addition, the aprotic polar solvents used in
LIBs sometimes make the formation of anion species energetically favorable
by suitable bond cleavage.

Figure 5 Ball-and-stick models of spontaneous bond breaking
caused by reduction
corresponding to the two outliers designated by arrows in Figure 4: carbonic acid,
methyl-2-propen-1-yl ester (top) and 2(3H)-furanone,
3-bromodihydro (bottom). White, gray, red, and dark red balls represent
H, C, O, and Br, respectively.

Thus, in the present calculations, it is somewhat difficult
to
interpret the results of the reduction potential because there are
cases where a chemical bond is spontaneously broken in the reduced
state, as shown in Figure 5. When the bond is cleaved, the polarization of the molecular
system increases. In a polar solvent, this leads to a stabilization
of the reduced state, which in turn leads to an increase in the reduction
potential. It seems that there are additive molecules that are thermodynamically
more stable in the cleaved state, even if their bonds are not spontaneously
broken in the present calculation. For this reason, there is a possibility
that the computationally predicted reduction potentials shown in Figure 1 are lower than those
in the real systems.

Another cause for the underestimation of
the reduction potentials
is that there is some ambiguity regarding the value of Vabs employed to scale the redox potentials. Although we
used the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
recommended value of 4.44 V, a somewhat smaller value (4.28 V) has
been reported.19 The adoption of the latter
increases the reduction potentials by 0.16 V.

Importance of Features
in Potential Prediction
The
number of features in a regression model is sometimes reduced to improve
its fitting accuracy as well as to facilitate the interpretation of
the results. Although the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO) is often used for that purpose in a linear regression model,
LASSO cannot be used for nonlinear regression models, such as the
GKRR, because it results in data selection instead of feature selection.
By contrast, it is possible to calculate the importance of each feature
in the GBR method. Figure 6 shows the relative feature importance in the prediction of
oxidation and reduction potentials by the GBR method. We found that
features C3, C4, O1, O2, and R6 rank high in both potentials. In addition
to these features, the features related to halogens (F1 and Cl1) are
also important in the reduction potential, whereas miscellaneous features
(F1, N3, and Si4) are important in the oxidation potential.

Figure 6 Relative feature
importance in GBR models. Oxidation potential
(top) and reduction potential (bottom). Dotted vertical lines represent
a relative importance of 30%.

We next examined how well the feature selection predicts
both potentials.
As an example, we used the top eight or nine features that have over
30% relative importance in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows that the degree of fitness to training data is not reduced
by the selection. In addition, the R2 scores
for both potentials did not change much, as shown in Table 1. By contrast, the fitness to
the test data by the trimmed model is somewhat worse than that resulting
from the full-feature model (Table 1). However, by comparing Figures 3, 4, and 7, we found that the essential behavior of the prediction
versus the density functional theory (DFT) calculations can still
be reproduced by the trimmed model.

Figure 7 GBR models with a reduced number of features:
oxidation potential
using eight key features in Figure 6 (top) and reduction potential using nine key features
in Figure 6 (bottom).
Blue and red circles correspond to the training data and test data,
respectively. Note that the axes are standardized.

reduction potential	training	0.985	0.982	
 	test	0.643	0.603	
a The top eight and nine features
were used for the oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively.

Finally, we considered the
reasons why the trimmed model predicted
the redox potentials reasonably well, and to a similar extent, to
that of the full-feature model. In the oxidized state, an electron
is extracted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), whereas
in the reduced state, it is added to the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO). Therefore, these frontier orbitals should be investigated.
We focused on N,N-diphenyl-benzenamine
(Id [82] in the Supporting Information).
This molecule has a three-coordinate nitrogen atom in the center.
According to Figure 6, N3 is more important for the oxidation potential than for the reduction
potential. This is consistent with the fact that the amplitude of
the eigenstate function is observed on nitrogen in the HOMO but not
in the LUMO, as shown in Figure 8. Quantitatively, the orbital-by-orbital population
analysis shows that the contributions of N3 to the HOMO and LUMO are
0.2778 and 0.0797, respectively. Thus, a correlation was found between
the results of machine learning and the electronic structure calculations.
Moreover, these results support the exclusion of hydrogen atoms from
the feature design because they form σ bonds, whose energy levels
are significantly far from those of the frontier orbitals (HOMO and
LUMO).

Conclusions
We performed ab initio molecular orbital
calculations to examine
the redox potentials of 149 representative molecules used as additives
for the electrolytes of LIBs. We observed that most of the anode additives
have oxidation potentials of 5 V (vs Li/Li+) or more, whereas
the majority of the cathode additives have oxidation potentials of
5 V (vs Li/Li+) or less. We constructed features of the
additive molecules based on their constituent elements and their coordination
numbers to predict the redox potentials by two regression methods,
GKRR and GBR. Although both methods predicted the oxidation potentials
fairly well, GBR was somewhat superior to GKRR in the prediction of
the reduction potentials. We also found that the essential character
of the redox potentials can be described by a smaller number of features
derived from the analysis of the important features in GBR. The importance
of these features seems to be related to the amplitude of the eigenstate
of the frontier orbitals.

Computational Details
All ab initio
molecular orbital calculations reported in this paper
were carried out with the Gaussian 16 Revision A.03 program.20 Hybrid DFT calculations were carried out using
the B3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation functional, which comprises
Becke’s three-parameter exchange functional and Lee–Yang–Parr
correlation functional.21−23 The 6-31++G(d,p) split-valence
double-zeta basis set augmented with polarization and diffuse functions
was used in this study. For all charge states, the molecular/ionic
geometries were fully optimized until the magnitude of the residual
forces became less than 4.5 × 10–4 hartree/bohr.
Solvent effects were treated by using the integral equation formalism
(IEF)-polarizable continuum model (PCM), which performs a reaction
field calculation using the IEF model.24 Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ε = 46.826) was used as a continuum
dielectric material in the IEF-PCM calculations with a default cavity.
Note that a mixed solvent composed of carbonates with high and low
dielectric constants is commonly used as an electrolyte solvent in
LIBs. For example, the dielectric constant of a 1:1 mixed solvent
of ethylene carbonate (ε = 90) and diethyl carbonate (ε
= 2.8) will be ε = 46, assuming additivity for the dielectric
constant with respect to volume. This value is close to the dielectric
constant of DMSO. We expect that using DMSO as the solvent will not
cause a large error because most of the solvent effect is determined
by the dielectric constant, although the solvent effect calculated
by PCM includes nonelectrostatic interactions, which reflect the shape
of the solvent molecule.

The oxidation (Vox) and reduction (Vred) potentials
of additive A on a voltage (vs
Li/Li+) scale were calculated as follows    where Etot(A)
is a total energy of A in electronvolts. Etot(A+) and Etot(A–) are the total energies of the oxidized and reduced states of A,
respectively. Vshift corresponds to the
difference between the absolute potential (Vabs) and the magnitude of the redox potential of the Li metal
(|VLi|). The values of Vabs and |VLi| are 4.4425 and 3.04 V,26 respectively.
The value used for Vabs is that estimated
by Trasatti and recommended by the IUPAC The use of these values results
in a Vshift of 1.4 V. Note that the total
energy output from the self-consistent reaction field calculation
in Gaussian 16 includes all computed corrections in solution, unlike
the Gaussian 03 output.

To find the relationship between the
structure of the additives
and their redox potentials, we considered two regression models: GKRR
and GBR. GKRR is a combination of the Gaussian kernel method and ridge
regression with L2-norm regularization term. Because of the flexibility
afforded by the nonlinear character of the Gaussian kernel and the
ingenious kernel trick, GKRR efficiently finds relationships that
ordinary linear regression fails to find.15 GKRR contains two hyperparameters (σ and λ), which were
optimized by using grid search. GBR produces a regression model in
the form of ensemble decision trees.27 It
evolves the model in a stepwise manner by optimizing the loss function
via its gradient. All machine learning calculations in this study
were based on the scikit-learn package, which is a collection of APIs
for machine learning in Python.28
