Silk
fibroin (SF) has shown enormous potentials in various fields;
however, application of SF in emulsion technology is quite limited.
Here, we use SF as a self-emulsifier to form an oil-in-water (O/W)
emulsion by emulsifying 1-butanol in SF aqueous solution. This showed
that SF possessed strong surface activity to stabilize the O/W emulsion
without the need for any other surface-active agent until its solidification
because of 1-butanol-induced conformational transition of SF to β-sheet.
After freezing the preformed emulsions at −20 °C, robust
three-dimensional porous SF scaffolds were prepared without the need
for any further post-treatment. The evolution from the O/W emulsion
to porous scaffold formation under freezing was tracked, and an emulsion–ice
dual template mechanism was proposed for scaffold formation, based
on which SF scaffolds with controllable hierarchically porous structures
were achieved by tuning the dispersed droplet volume fraction. Furthermore,
SF scaffolds with hierarchical porosity showed significantly higher
bioactivity toward L929 fibroblasts than that of SF scaffolds with
mono macroporosity, highlighting the great asset of this hierarchically
porous SF scaffold for broad applications in tissue engineering. Therefore,
the strong surface-active characteristic of SF presented here, in
addition to its distinct advantages, sheds a bright light on the application
of SF in the vast range of emulsion technologies, especially in cosmetic-,
food-, and biomedical-related areas.

Introduction
Tissue engineering
provides a promising solution toward failure
of tissues and/or organs arising from disease or other damages.1 The success of tissue engineering greatly relies
on the construction of suitable scaffolds.1−4 Extracellular matrix (ECM) is
an excellent example of a natural scaffold with an exquisite hierarchical
architecture (a collection of macro-, micro-, and nanoscale features),
which is able to offer an optimal environment for cells and therefore
to maintain excellent biological functions.5,6 Previous
studies have shown that biomimetic scaffolds designed with hierarchically
porous structures showed better cellular functions and tissue regeneration
than those of the conventional ones that have only macroporosity;
however, materials used for such scaffolds were limited to only a
few synthetic polymers.6−8 Therefore, it is highly alluring as well as challenging
to develop more strategies to construct hierarchically porous scaffolds
using biomacromolecules that have been widely used to make scaffolds
due to their distinct advantages in bioactivity, biocompatibility,
and biodegradability.

Silk fibroin (SF) from the core of Bombyx mori silkworm silk, a cheap and sustainable
protein fiber with abundant
supply through the mature sericulture industry flourishing in textile
for centuries, has now shown vast progress in developing a wide range
of biomaterials due to its excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility,
and biodegradability.9−16 The SF molecule consists of a heavy chain (390 kDa) and a light
chain (25 kDa), which are connected by a disulfide link.17 The highly repetitive GAGAGS (G: glycine; A:
alanine; S: serine) amino acid motifs constitute the primary structure
of the heavy chain and is considered as the crystallizable segment,
whereas the rest amino acid residues form the amorphous region.18 There are 12 hydrophobic crystalline domains
distributed in 11 hydrophilic amorphous domains and 2 hydrophilic
terminals, which make SF a natural amphiphilic multiblock copolymer.19−21 On the basis of this characteristic structure, the assembly behavior
and structure of SF at the interface attract extensive attention;22−27 however, research on SF at the emulsion interface is still insufficient.

Currently, SF scaffolds are mainly prepared using particulate leaching
(e.g., NaCl salt particles), gas foaming, lyophilization, or three-dimensional
(3D) printing methods; however, these approaches either suffer from
the need for tedious post-treatments or lack the ability to control
the hierarchical structure of the pores.9−11,28 We previously developed a facile method to fabricate 3D porous SF
scaffolds by simply freezing the mixtures of 1-butanol and SF aqueous
solution, which not only provided a flexible approach for gross shape
control but also avoided the use of highly toxic chemicals and any
further post-treatment (such as high-energy-consuming freeze-drying).29 To better understand the mechanism of scaffold
formation of this technique as well as self-assembly behavior of SF
at the emulsion interface, and therefore to achieve exquisite regulation
of the porous structure of SF scaffolds, we investigated the oil-in-water
(O/W) emulsions formed using 1-butanol as the oil phase and SF aqueous
solution as the water phase in the present study. It is expected that
SF would act as a self-emulsifier able to stabilize the formed O/W
emulsions; thereafter, conformational transition of SF induced by
1-butanol would lead to solidification of the emulsions, resulting
in the formation of SF scaffolds. SF scaffolds formed via emulsions
at room temperature (RT) or −20 °C were investigated.
On the basis of these studies, the scaffold formation mechanism of
this technique and application of these SF scaffolds were explored.
We expect that this study would provide important insight into preparing
hierarchically porous SF scaffolds for broad applications in tissue
engineering and applying SF, considering its strong surface-active
characteristics and other distinct advantages, in the vast range of
emulsion technologies, especially in cosmetic-, food-, biomedical-related
areas.

Results and Discussion
SF Self-Emulsified O/W Emulsions
When 1-butanol was
added into a SF aqueous solution at room temperature, due to low solubility
of 1-butanol in water (i.e., 8.03 wt % at 20 °C),30 phase separation occurred. After 2 days, a white
film formed at the 1-butanol/water interface; thereafter, the SF solution
in the sublayer gradually turned into a white SF gel in one more day
(Figure S1A–C, see Supporting Information).
On the basis of these observations and our previous research on behaviors
of SF at the water–air interface,25 we believe that SF possesses superior surface activity because of
its natural characteristic of an “amphiphilic multiblock copolymer”
structure. Therefore, in the 1-butanol/SF solution system without
stirring, SF chains would slowly diffuse from aqueous solution to
the interface between water and 1-butanol and adsorb there to minimize
the interface tension. SF chains at the interface would then rearrange
to expose hydrophilic domains toward the aqueous phase whereas hydrophobic
domains toward the organic phase, which consequently facilitated conformational
transition of SF induced by 1-butanol to assemble and form a white
film first at the interface due to the higher 1-butanol content around
the interface.31 Thereafter, conformational
transition of SF in the bulk aqueous solution began to accelerate
taking SF assemblies at the interface as nuclei,32 resulting in the formation of SF gel. On the other hand,
when stirring (400 rpm) was applied to the 1-butanol/SF solution mixture,
an O/W emulsion formed with 1-butanol droplets dispersed in the continuous
SF solution. Eventually, the emulsion solidified into a scaffold in
about 6 h at room temperature (RT-SF scaffold; Figure S1D,E, see Supporting Information). Apparently, stirring
not only sheared 1-butanol into dispersed droplets but also accelerated
SF’s diffusion to and adsorption at the interface as well as
matter exchange between the two phases, leading to faster molecular
arrangement and self-assembly of SF with the help of 1-butanol both
at the interface and in the bulk aqueous solution.

The O/W emulsions
formed with various volume ratios of 1-butanol/SF aqueous solution
(denoted BuOH/SF throughout the text) were studied with an optical
microscope (OM). When BuOH/SF increased from 1/4 to 1/1, the number
of dispersed emulsion droplets increased (Figure 1A), whereas the average droplet size only
slightly increased from 6.6 ± 6.0 to 11.9 ± 3.6 μm
without any significant difference (P > 0.05, Figure 1C); this is because
under the same experimental conditions the physical nature of the
two phases and SF acting as the emulsifier jointly determined the
interfacial characteristics of the O/W emulsions;33 for BuOH/SF of 1/1, spherical emulsion droplets packed
densely and squeezed each other, resulting in slight deformation at
the edge (Figure 1A,
marked by arrows). Statistical analysis on emulsion droplet size showed
a Gaussian distribution for the three emulsions (Figure 1B). As a comparison, without
the presence of SF, stirring the mixture of 1-butanol/water could
not form an emulsion, confirming SF’s vital role in the preparation
and stabilization of the O/W emulsions because no other surface-active
agent was added. SF adsorbed at the interface not only decreased the
interfacial tension but also acted as a protective barrier to prevent
coalescence of the emulsion droplets upon contact with each other
and/or Ostwald ripening. Moreover, SF in the continuous aqueous solution
increased the viscosity of the system, thus reducing the frequency
of droplet encountering. All of these factors contributed to stabilization
of SF self-emulsified emulsions.34

of O/W emulsions prepared with BuOH/SF of 1/4, 1/2, and 1/1 (the arrows
indicate slight deformation at the edge of the emulsion droplets)
and (C) average droplet size of O/W emulsions and average pore size
of RT-SF scaffolds formed from these emulsions after different periods
at room temperature.

The O/W emulsions were stable until solidification into RT-SF
scaffolds
after 6 h at room temperature because neither emulsion breaking nor
flocculation (creaming and/or sedimentation) was observed. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) study of RT-SF scaffolds clearly shows that
the macropores (Figure 2A, white arrows) were derived from the emulsion droplets that remained
dispersed in the solidified SF matrix because they showed similar
trends with the emulsion droplets as observed in the O/W emulsions
(Figure 1A,B) in terms
of pore quantities and pore size distributions regarding variation
of BuOH/SF (Figure 2A,B). The average pore size increased from 14.2 ± 3.6 to 31.9
± 5.2 μm when BuOH/SF increased from 1/4 to 1/1, which
was just slightly bigger than the droplet size of the corresponding
emulsions (Figure 1C), suggesting excellent stability of the O/W emulsions over time
until solidification of SF. These findings confirm that SF is a superior
emulsifier.

SF matrix is marked by black arrows). (C) Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of SF in the as-made O/W emulsion with BuOH/SF of
1/2 and in the scaffolds formed from these emulsions after 6 h at
room temperature.

FT-IR spectra of SF in
the emulsions and in the RT-SF scaffolds
are shown in Figure 2C. For SF in the freshly made emulsion, the characteristic broad
peak at 1650 cm–1 was assigned to the random coil/helical
conformation; in addition, a tiny convex peak at around 1700 cm–1, which was related to the β-turn conformation,35 could be observed, suggesting that upon mixing
1-butanol with SF solution to form the O/W emulsion conformational
transition of SF to β-turn first occurred, which was consistent
with the report on 1-butanol-induced conformational transition of
the SF film.36 This is because 1-butanol
has weak ability to induce conformational transition of SF,36 and β-turn, which is usually associated
with the formation of β-sheet and only involves local arrangement
of four residues in SF chains, is easier to achieve than β-sheet.35 For SF in the RT-SF scaffolds, in addition to
the dominant broad peak at 1650 cm–1, shoulder peaks
at 1700 and 1625 cm–1, which were attributable to
β-turn and β-sheet structures, respectively,35 could be observed, indicating that 1-butanol
induced conformational transition to β-sheet, which acted as
physical cross-linkers, resulting in solidification of the O/W emulsions
to form RT-SF scaffolds. With an increase in BuOH/SF from 1/4 to 1/1,
the β-sheet content increased, indicated by the slightly increasing
peak at 1625 cm–1.

Interestingly, RT-SF scaffolds
solidified from dense emulsions
(e.g., BuOH/SF of 1/1) showed a hierarchically porous structure, featuring
emulsion-templated macropores, interconnected micropores, and nanofibrous
SF matrix (Figure 2A, black arrows). The interconnected porous structure usually forms
after solidification of the continuous phase in a dense emulsion where
dispersed droplets squeezed each other, e.g., high internal phase
emulsion-templated porous materials,37 whereas
the SF matrix is similar to the nanofibrous structure in ethanol-induced
SF gels.38 Although SF materials with such
hierarchically porous structures are highly desirable, all RT-SF scaffolds
were friable and easily broken up upon handling, which restricted
their applications.

Mechanism of Scaffold Formation through Freezing
the O/W Emulsion
Although RT-SF scaffolds were mechanically
friable, we found that
by simply freezing these O/W emulsions at −20 °C overnight,
robust SF scaffolds (F-SF scaffolds; Figure S2, see Supporting Information) were obtained without any post-treatment.29 To further clarify the scaffold formation mechanism
of this facile technique, the evolution from the O/W emulsion to porous
scaffold formation under freezing was tracked with SEM and FT-IR.

As shown in Figure 3A, the freshly prepared emulsion showed a morphology corresponding
well to the OM observations (Figure 1A), i.e., pores with sizes ranging from 5 to 30 μm
were derived from the dispersed droplets, whereas the nanofibrous
network in the surrounding matrix maintained the morphology of SF
in the continuous aqueous solution. After 15 min of freezing at −20
°C, morphology barely changed compared to that of the freshly
prepared emulsion except that a few small pores of around 5 μm
appeared in the nanofibrous network, which could be vacancies left
by ice crystals frozen from the aqueous phase. When the freezing time
increased to 30 min, although emulsion droplet-templated pores did
not change, ice-templated pores in the nanofibrous network increased
in terms of both quantity and size and a few smooth and dense SF membranes
appeared as pore walls. This should be because ice nuclei increased
in number and began to grow.

analysis, and (C)
FT-IR spectra of SF through the evolution from O/W emulsion (BuOH/SF
of 1/2) to scaffold formation under freezing at −20 °C
for different periods.

As freezing continued to 1 h, the morphology changed dramatically
because of the rapid growth of ice crystals, average pore size rapidly
increased to around 100 μm (Figure 3B), and more smooth SF membranes formed as
pore walls, whereas the nanofibrous network reduced. Thus, it became
impossible to distinguish
1-butanol droplet-templated pores from ice-templated pores. After
6.5 h of freezing, no nanofibrous network could be found and the homogeneous
porous scaffold showed only the smooth and dense SF membrane pore
walls, whereas the average pore size increased slightly to around
110 μm (Figure 3B), suggesting that growth of ice crystals was restricted after 1
h of freezing because the dense SF membrane pore walls could hinder
ice growth. A further increase in freezing time did not alter the
morphology and average pore size (Figure 3B), implying that ice growth completed. Moreover,
pore size analysis shows that emulsion-templated pores increased from
5–30 μm to around 110 μm (Figure 3B), suggesting that when ice growth pushed
emulsion droplets to move close to each other under freezing at −20
°C adequate stability of the O/W emulsion was maintained because
coalescence occurred to a limited extent.

Real-time FT-IR studies
are shown in Figure 3C. As mentioned above, 1-butanol-induced
conformational transition of SF to β-turn first occurred in
the freshly made O/W emulsion and with the increase in freezing time
to 24 h the convex peak at around 1700 cm–1 gradually
increased to become a small peak. On the other hand, after 30 min
of freezing, a shoulder at 1625 cm–1 appeared, indicating
that conformational transition to β-sheet via intermediate of
β-turn took place.35 As freezing
continued to 1 h, the shoulder at 1625 cm–1 increased
significantly to become a peak that surpassed the peak at 1650 cm–1, suggesting fast conformational transition from random
coil/helical to β-sheet. Apparently, this was caused by formation
and rapid growth of ice crystals as observed with SEM (Figure 3A), which not only resulted
in concentration of SF aqueous solution, leading to a shorter chain–chain
distance that would facilitate 1-butanol-induced self-assembly of
SF, but also pushed these SF assemblies and molecules moving toward
each other to aggregate into dense SF membranes as pore walls. As
controls, SF solution and RT-SF scaffolds were frozen at −20
°C for 24 h, respectively. After thawing, for the solution sample,
only SF aqueous solution was recovered, indicating that shearing force
generated by ice formation is inadequate to induce conformational
transition of SF from water-soluble random coil/helical to water-insoluble
β-sheet;39 for the scaffold sample,
the resulting scaffolds were still mechanically friable and showed
no difference in morphology (data not shown), suggesting that once
conformational transition to β-sheet, acting as physical cross-linkers,
has completed, ice formation is unable to change the structure. These
results point to the importance of kinetic sequence or synchronism
between 1-butanol-induced SF conformational transition and freezing-induced
ice formation for the present technique. That is, ice formation and
growth could accelerate and enhance the conformational transition
of SF to β-sheet only after the dehydration activity of 1-butanol
has initiated the transition and before the transition is complete,
as presented here. Therefore, compared to that for RT-SF scaffolds
(Figure 2C), the β-sheet
content was much higher for F-SF scaffolds. As freezing continued
to 24 h, the peak at 1625 cm–1 kept increasing,
whereas the peak at 1650 cm–1 decreased to become
a shoulder, suggesting that SF molecules could still move to accomplish
conformational transition at −20 °C, although their movement
would indeed slow down, as dictated from the energy perspective. Meanwhile,
SEM study shows that the morphology and average pore size were essentially
unchanged after 1 h of freezing (Figure 3A,B). Therefore, F-SF scaffolds with a similar
porous structure yet different β-sheet content (determining
adjustable degradation behavior) could be obtained using this technique
by simply controlling the freezing periods.

Apparently, freezing-caused
structural change in the resulting
F-SF scaffolds, as indicated by SEM and FT-IR studies, is the reason
for the improved mechanical properties, compared to those of the friable
RT-SF scaffolds, which is most likely due to the formation of large
β-sheet domains, same as reported for ethanol-induced weak SF
gels.40 Ice formation from the SF solution
under freezing not only resulted in a higher β-sheet content
and relatively tight structure (indicated by the smooth and dense
membrane pore walls) but also might restrict the growth of β-sheet
domains and thereby might form numerous small-sized β-sheet
domains. These structural features can disperse stress effectively
and thus improve the mechanical properties.40−42 Moreover, volume
expansion during ice formation would generate a strong shearing force,39 which might biaxially stretch SF assemblies/molecules
to achieve a certain extent of molecular orientation in the pore walls,
the effect of which resembles the blow molding process in plastic
industry.43 We have previously reported
that uniaxial extension of SF film indeed enhanced its toughness and
strength.44

Fabrication of F-SF Scaffolds
with a Controllable Hierarchically
Porous Structure
The effects of BuOH/SF on the structure
of F-SF scaffolds were characterized with SEM. For BuOH/SF of 1/4
and 1/2, the resulting scaffolds showed a homogenous porous structure
with open mono macropores as well as smooth and dense membrane pore
walls. When BuOH/SF increased to 1/1, the resulting scaffold showed
a hierarchically porous structure featuring open macropores, interconnected
micropores, and micro-/nanofibrous structures in the pore walls (Figure 4).

Figure 4 SEM images of F-SF scaffolds
prepared from O/W emulsions with different
BuOH/SF after freezing at −20 °C for 24 h.

On the basis of above investigations on the stability
of O/W emulsions
at room temperature or −20 °C, a SF self-emulsified O/W
emulsion–ice dual template mechanism is proposed for the preparation
of robust F-SF scaffolds with controllable hierarchical porosities,
as depicted in Figure 5. When 1-butanol is emulsified in SF aqueous solution with stirring
to form O/W emulsions, SF molecules, acting as the self-emulsifier,
effectively stabilize the emulsions. During freezing at −20
°C, apart from the emulsion template, ice forms from the SF solution
to serve as the second pore template. In addition, ice formation not
only enhances the conformational transition of SF to β-sheet,
which is initiated by 1-butanol to act as physical cross-linkers,
but also improves structural performance that leads to the formation
of robust porous F-SF scaffolds without the need for any further post-treatment.
Moreover, by tuning the emulsion droplet volume fraction, F-SF scaffolds
with controlled hierarchical porosities can be prepared. For a diluted
emulsion (BuOH/SF of 1/4 and 1/2), droplets are dispersed with enough
distance from each other that the resulting F-SF scaffolds show a
mono macroporous structure with smooth and dense membrane pore walls
templated by ice crystals and partially coalesced droplets. For a
concentrated emulsion (BuOH/SF of 1/1), droplets pack densely, leading
to interconnected micropores and micro-/nanofibrous structures in
the pore walls, which, together with the macropores templated by ice
crystals and partially coalesced droplets, demonstrate a hierarchically
porous structure of the resulting F-SF scaffolds (Figure 4).

Figure 5 Schematic illustration
of the SF self-emulsified O/W emulsion–ice
dual template mechanism for the preparation of 3D porous SF scaffolds
with different structures.

It is well known that the increasing viscosity of the continuous
phase can impart added stability to the emulsion.34 With this method to enhance emulsion stability in our system,
coalescence of the 1-butanol droplets may be reduced or avoided, which
assures sufficient droplet quantity and interface area. Therefore,
when ice formation pushes emulsion droplets to move close to each
other under freezing at −20 °C, the dispersed droplets
can realize a dense packing state with a reduced BuOH/SF compared
to BuOH/SF of 1/1 as described above, thus also leading to the formation
of a hierarchically porous structure. To verify this hypothesis, we
used 13 wt % SF solution, which had a higher viscosity than that of
7 wt % solution,45 as the aqueous phase
to prepare the O/W emulsion at a reduced BuOH/SF of 1/2. After freezing
at −20 °C for 24 h, the resulting scaffolds indeed showed
a hierarchically porous structure featuring open macropores templated
by ice crystals, interconnected micropores, and micro-/nanofibrous
structures in the pore walls templated by the densely packed droplets
(Figure 4).

Physical
Properties of F-SF Scaffolds
Apart from controlling
the hierarchical porosities of F-SF scaffolds, the effects of BuOH/SF
on the pore size, porosity, water uptake, and mechanical properties
of F-SF scaffolds were tested.

With an increase in BuOH/SF from
1/4 to 1/1, the average pore size of F-SF scaffolds decreased from
230 to 110 μm, whereas porosities were essentially unchanged
with values of about 95% (Table 1). The same low SF content (7 wt %) and the emulsion–ice
dual templates jointly contributed to the similar high porosities
of F-SF scaffolds, although BuOH/SF could control the hierarchical
structure of their pores (Figure 4). Moreover, hexane, used in the test of porosities
via the liquid displacement method, could neither swell nor shrink
the SF matrix;46 therefore, the high porosities
suggest that the pores of F-SF scaffolds are interconnected, which
can provide abundant 3D space for cell growth and help mass exchange
to transport nutrition in and metabolite out in tissue engineering.4

Scaffolds for tissue engineering are required to have
strong ability
for water uptake, which favors cell adhesion and growth.47,48 When BuOH/SF increased from 1/4 to 1/1, water uptakes of F-SF scaffolds
were in the range of 18–21 g/g, which correlated to water contents
of about 95% for the wet F-SF scaffolds (Table 1). The high water uptakes could be due to
the hydrophilic nature of SF and the interconnected high porosities
of F-SF scaffolds.48

Scaffolds for
tissue engineering are placed with stringent mechanical
requirements; they must not only support cell activities and new tissue
integration both in vitro and in vivo but also resist handling during
surgery and withstand post-implantation hydrodynamic and mechanical
stresses and strains in vivo.49 Compression
curves of F-SF scaffolds in wet conditions were recorded, and the
corresponding compressive modulus and strength are listed in Table 1. With the increase
of BuOH/SF from 1/4 to 1/1, the compressive modulus first deceased
from 360 to 230 kPa and then increased slightly to 260 kPa; the compressive
strength showed a similar trend. According to the theoretical framework
established for mechanical behavior of low-density porous scaffolds
for tissue engineering, the compressive modulus and strength of the
porous scaffolds are proportional to the square of the relative density
(ratio of the apparent density including the pores and the density
of the material forming the scaffold) and also proportional to the
modulus of the material forming the scaffold.49−51 Therefore,
to eliminate the influence due to different porosities, the specific
compressive modulus and strength were calculated by normalizing the
compressive modulus and strength by the scaffold density (Table 1). When BuOH/SF increased
from 1/4 to 1/1, the specific compressive modulus of F-SF scaffolds
decreased from 5400 to 3800 kPa·cm3/g. These values
were an order of magnitude higher than those of SF scaffolds prepared
by salt-leaching with a methanol post-treatment (about 200 kPa·cm3/g) and comparable to the value of SF composite scaffolds
reinforced with 200% silk particles (ranging from 4600 to 7700 kPa·cm3/g).49 Theoretically, pore wall
or local strut characteristics determine the global mechanical properties
of porous scaffolds.49,50 For SF-based materials, the mechanical
properties are closely linked to the secondary structure and even
higher level of aggregation structure of SF, which are not merely
determined by the primary amino acid sequence but more depend on the
control by the processing techniques employed.52 As described above, the significantly improved mechanical
properties of F-SF scaffolds were due to the enhanced toughness and
strength of pore walls caused by the freezing-induced structural change.

Bioactivity of SF Scaffolds
To assess the effects of
different hierarchical porosities of F-SF scaffolds on their bioactivity
toward L929 murine fibroblast, as a representative mammalian cell,
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay was employed to evaluate the viability and proliferation of
L929 cells cultured on F-SF scaffolds for 10 days. F-SF scaffolds
prepared with BuOH/SF of 1/2 and 1/1 were chosen because they shared
similar pore size, porosity, and mechanical properties (Table 1) whereas different hierarchical
porosities (Figure 4). After seeding with the same amount of cells on each scaffold (1
× 104 cells/cm2) and incubating for 1 day,
we did not notice any cells grew on the culture plates, neither did
we find any dead cells on the scaffolds with live/dead staining assays,
indicating that all of the seeded cells adhered on the scaffolds;
when the culture time extended through 10 days, L929 cells could further
grow and proliferate on both scaffolds (Figure 6), suggesting no cytotoxicity of F-SF scaffolds
prepared through our strategy. Moreover, after 3 days of culture,
cells on F-SF scaffolds with hierarchical porosity (BuOH/SF of 1/1)
were significantly more than cells on F-SF scaffolds with mono macroporosity
(BuOH/SF of 1/2) (P < 0.05); with culture time
increased to 6 and 10 days, the discrepancy between them became even
more significant (P < 0.01, Figure 6A). The enhancement of cellular activity
by the hierarchically porous structure was also demonstrated by the
fluorescence microscopy images showing higher degree of cell spreading
across the scaffolds (both on the surface or into the scaffold) after
10 days of culture compared to that across F-SF scaffolds with mono
macroporosity (Figure 6B). These results clearly indicate the crucial role of the micropores
and micro-/nanofibrous structures in the walls of macropores, which
mimic extracellular matrix to provide an optimal environment for cell
adhesion, migration, and proliferation through the scaffolds.5,53 The findings presented here point to great potentials of F-SF scaffolds
with such a hierarchically porous structure for a broad range of tissue
engineering and other related biomedical applications.

Conclusions
In the present study,
SF was used as the self-emulsifier to prepare
O/W emulsions by taking advantage of SF’s strong surface activity
using 1-butanol as the oil phase and SF aqueous solution as the water
phase without addition of any other surface-active agent. Thereafter,
3D porous F-SF scaffolds with high porosity and strong mechanical
properties were prepared through emulsion–ice dual templates
without the need for any further post-treatment due to 1-butanol-induced
conformational transition of SF to β-sheet, which acted as the
cross-linkers. It was found that the freezing-caused structural change
was the reason for the improved mechanical properties of the resulting
F-SF scaffolds, and by tuning the dispersed droplet volume fraction,
F-SF scaffolds with controllable hierarchically porous structures
were achieved. Therefore, by ingeniously taking SF as both the emulsifier
and the matrix material, we provide a simple strategy to preparing
SF scaffolds yet with versatile control on both the gross shape and
the microscale hierarchically porous structure. Furthermore, it was
found that F-SF scaffolds with hierarchical porosity showed significantly
higher bioactivity toward L929 fibroblasts than that of F-SF scaffolds
with mono macroporosity, highlighting the great asset of hierarchically
porous F-SF scaffolds prepared using this strategy for the broad applications
in tissue engineering and other related biomedical areas. Moreover,
the strong surface-active characteristic of SF presented here, in
addition to its distinct advantages, sheds a bright light on the application
of SF in the vast range of emulsion technologies, especially in cosmetic-,
food-, and biomedical-related areas.

Experimental Section
SF Self-Emulsified
O/W Emulsions
SF aqueous solution
was prepared following well-established protocols.20 A 7 wt % SF solution was used in this study unless otherwise
specified. 1-Butanol was added into SF aqueous solution at various
volume ratios under stirring (400 rpm) for 2 min at room temperature
to form O/W emulsions. The obtained emulsions were kept at room temperature
for a series of periods until solidification to form RT-SF scaffolds.
At each time point, these emulsions were observed under an optical
microscope (OM, Olympus BX-51, Japan), the emulsion droplet size and
its distribution were analyzed with Atlas software (Tescan, Czech),
and more than 100 droplets were randomly selected for the statistical
analysis. RT-SF scaffolds were studied with SEM and FT-IR.

Fabrication
of Porous SF Scaffolds
Freshly prepared
O/W emulsions were casted into a custom-built mold and frozen at −20
°C for 24 h to fabricate porous F-SF scaffolds following our
established procedure.29 After thawing
and washing with deionized water to thoroughly remove 1-butanol, wet
F-SF scaffolds (filled with water) with gross shape of the mold were
obtained (Figure S2, see Supporting Information).
Dry F-SF scaffolds could be obtained when needed through a further
freeze-drying process.

To track the evolution from the O/W emulsion
to porous scaffold formation, the freshly prepared O/W emulsions (BuOH/SF
of 1/2) were kept at −20 °C for a series of periods; three
samples were then taken out and immediately immersed into liquid nitrogen
(−196 °C), followed by lyophilization immediately. With
such an ultrarapid cooling rate, both solute (SF) and solvent (water
and 1-butanol) molecules were promptly immobilized (or vitrified)
in situ, where amorphous ice formed instead of ice crystal, thus avoiding
the structure and volume change due to ice crystal growth.54 Therefore, with this approach, real-time investigation
of emulsion (or scaffold) morphology and SF conformation during freezing
the emulsions could be realized with SEM and FT-IR, respectively.
