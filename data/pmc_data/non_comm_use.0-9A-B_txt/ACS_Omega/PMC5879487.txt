The
gradual discovery of functional domains in native enamel matrix
proteins has enabled the design of smart bioinspired peptides for
tooth enamel mimetics and repair. In this study, we expanded upon
the concept of biomineralization to design smaller amelogenin-inspired
peptides with conserved functional domains for clinical translation.
The synthetic peptides displayed a characteristic nanostructured scaffold
reminiscent of ‘nanospheres’ seen in the enamel matrix
and effectively controlled apatite nucleation in vitro resulting in
the formation of smaller crystallites. Following application of the
peptides to sectioned human molar teeth, a robust, oriented, synthetic
aprismatic enamel was observed after 7 days of incubation in situ.
There was a two-fold increase in the hardness and modulus of the regrown
enamel-like apatite layers and an increase in the attachment of the
tooth-regrown layer interface compared to control samples. Repeated
peptide applications generated multiple enamel-like hydroxyapatite
(HAP) layers of limited thickness produced by epitaxial growth in
which c-axis oriented nanorods evolved on the surface
of native enamel. We conclude that peptide analogues with active domains
can effectively regulate the orientation of regenerated HAP layers
to influence functional response. Moreover, this enamel biofabrication
approach demonstrates the peptide-mediated growth of multiple microscale
HAP arrays of organized microarchitecture with potential for enamel
repair.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Most
mineralized tissues in nature are biological composites that
achieve distinctive hierarchical structures through a complex integration
of their mineral and organic phases across multiple length scales.
Building on the principles of biomineralization, a critical understanding
of material chemistry and life sciences may open trajectories for
the fabrication of organized, biomimetic materials.1−3 Dental enamel,
the hardest mineralized tissue in the vertebrate body, is a biological
mineralized composite characterized by an exceptional toughness and
moderate brittleness that is particularly difficult to replicate synthetically.
Enamel constitutes the outer protective covering of the tooth and
is composed of c-axis oriented carbonated hydroxyapatite
(HAP) nanorods (∼60 nm wide)4 arranged
in bundles of prisms or rods (∼6 μm in width)5 and delimited by organic sheaths and interprismatic
crystallites. In humans, the outermost layer of surface enamel is
composed of columns of HAP crystals disposed parallel to each other
and perpendicular to the enamel periphery, termed “aprismatic”
or “prismless” enamel (∼16–45 μm
thickness).6 Frequently abraded during
mastication, this highly mineralized aprismatic layer is harder and
less permeable than the enamel subsurface.7 This preferential use of a columnar architecture demonstrates a
more regular organization of microcrystals that is associated with
functionality,8 making it an appropriate
model structure to emulate for surface enamel restoration. Tooth enamel
is acellular in nature, scarcely remineralizes and does not possess
the capacity to remodel or regenerate. These attributes facilitate
the exigency to develop enamel-inspired biomaterials for superficial
repair of abraded or diseased tooth structure.

Amelogenin, the
major intrinsically disordered structural protein
in an enamel matrix, is believed to play a central role in enamel
formation.9−11 Previous studies have shown the in vitro assembly
of amelogenin into spherical nanospheres of ∼17–18 nm
diameter, which can promote crystal organization.12,13 Amelogenin may also assemble into oligomers, nanoribbons, and other
elongated assemblies under a host of different in vitro conditions.14−16 Prior work has documented that amelogenin-based supramolecular assemblies
exert a strong influence over the organization and directionality
of needlelike fluoridated HAP crystals formed on the etched enamel.17 Our knowledge of the crucial role of amelogenin
in monitoring mineralization has been further developed by studying
knockout mice lacking the gene that codes for amelogenin (Amelx). Amelx-null mice express a characteristic
disorganized (prismless), discolored, hypomineralized enamel that
is only 10–20% of normal enamel thickness and includes mixed
mineral phases.18−20 Hence, a systematic understanding of amelogenin protein
structure, assembly, and behavior in a dynamic extracellular environment
may lead to the design of practical peptide scaffolds for enamel mimetics.
The use of peptides as an efficient fabrication strategy has facilitated
the design of complex bioinspired materials and architectonics over
different hierarchical length scales.21,22 This approach
offers striking benefits, such as structural programmability, biocompatibility,
biodegradability, easy handling, and affordable cost of synthesis.

The growing need for minimally invasive treatment strategies to
combat the increasing prevalence of tooth decay has challenged researchers
and dental clinicians to reconsider a more preventive management approach.
Previous studies have investigated the role of fluoride,23,24 bioactive glasses,25 charged amino acids,26,27 organic scaffolds,28,29 and dendrimers30,31 in addressing surface enamel remineralization. Ample opportunity
remains to exploit the complex assembly, active domains, and mineral
precursor stabilization properties of native amelogenin protein to
design a synthetic counterpart for bulk enamel restoration. Biomimetic
in vitro approaches using full-length amelogenin (rP172) and leucine-rich
amelogenin peptide (LRAP) have demonstrated the capacity to regrow
organized enamel-like apatite crystals on demineralized tooth enamel
while achieving biointegration and improved mechanical strength postenamel
repair.32−34 These treatment outcomes present advantages over
conventional preventive fluoride treatments, including no risk of
toxicity, offering biocompatibility, biointegration, enhanced functional
responses, and improved permeation of mineral ions to treat deeper
subsurface white spot lesions.35

Here, we report the design of two synthetic amelogenin-inspired
peptides of 26 and 32 amino acid residues (P26 and P32, respectively)
that retain the vital functional domains of native amelogenin. This
biofabrication approach sought to characterize the designed peptides
and test their potential to (a) assemble into a scaffold that may
potentially control the nucleation and habit of the apatite crystalline
phase, (b) reconstruct a robust synthetic aprismatic enamel in an
in situ tooth model system, and (c) determine whether repeated peptide
applications on tooth slices immersed in artificial saliva can be
used to reconstitute organized multiple microscale layers. Such layers
will be formed from nanoscale apatite crystals and will attain scalability
for clinical viability. The secondary structure and assembly of the
peptides were characterized using circular dichroism (CD) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Peptide-mediated mineralization experiments
in vitro were observed using TEM and in situ Raman spectroscopy. The
microstructure, orientation, elemental composition, and mechanical
performance of the regenerated enamel-like HAP layers were characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nanoindentation tests. We report
a bottom-up mineralization strategy showing that amelogenin-inspired
peptides with functional domains can effectively guide the oriented
growth of multiple HAP layers with increased adhesion to the native
enamel and increased mechanical properties.

2 Results
2.1 Rationale for Peptide Design: Developing Amelogenin-Inspired
Peptides for Enamel Restoration
In an attempt to develop
an enamel restoration strategy with the necessary qualities for clinical
adoption, we designed 26- and 32-residue amelogenin-inspired peptides
(here called P26 and P32) as potential biomimetic mineralization agents
based on a critical understanding of the apatite-binding and mineralization-promoting
domains of the native amelogenin protein. The fundamental difference
between the primary sequences of the two peptides is the presence
of two extra polyproline repeat motifs (PVH/PMQ) in P32. The physicochemical
properties of the peptides and their amino acid sequences are illustrated
in Table 1 and Figure 1a, respectively.
We retained the last 12 mers of the C-terminus containing ∼50%
of the charged residues of the full-length amelogenin and enriched
in disorder-promoting residues (E, K, and R) that may have functional
traits in promoting mineralization.36 The
close proximity of the hydrophilic C-terminus of amelogenin to the
HAP surface has been directly implicated in mediating crystal nucleation
and oriented growth processes through a highly specific protein–crystal
interaction.37−39 Owing to the presence of charged residues at the
two end terminals of native amelogenin, both domains have proven to
exert a dynamic role in their interaction with developing enamel crystals.40 Hence, we preserved 14 amino acid residues from
the inner N-terminus (residues 1–4; 16–25) with a phosphorylated
serine (pS16). The N-terminal plays a more active role
in self-assembly and in increasing mineralization kinetics than in
HAP-binding interactions, which indicate the functional diversity
of separate domains within a single protein.41 It has been shown through in vitro mineralization studies that the
role on the N-terminal (+P) is to regulate the crystal shape and stabilize
amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) formation, thus playing a vital
role in controlling crystal morphology and apatite phase transition.42 For P-32, we added two polyproline repeat regions
(PXX/PXQ) from the middle hydrophobic core of native amelogenin to
observe whether addition of proline repeat length to the C-terminus
would modulate crystal elongation and growth as suggested in previous
literature.43 The aim was to translate
an in-depth understanding of the amelogenin structure and function
into the design of novel amelogenin-derived peptides for regenerative
studies.

2.2 P26 and P32 are Intrinsically
Disordered and
Form Spherical Assemblies
CD revealed that both peptides
exhibited a disordered conformation (Figure 1b,c). The recorded CD spectra displayed a
random-coiled structure having a sharp negative ellipticity with a
minimum at 200–205 nm. No discernible conformational changes
were observed when the peptides interacted with calcium (3 and 10
mM). Full-length recombinant amelogenin (rP172) was used for comparison
and displayed a random-coiled structural conformation similar to that
of the peptides, consistent with previous literature.44

The assembled nanostructures formed by the peptides
were examined by TEM. P26 and P32 displayed the formation of dispersed,
characteristic nanospherical particles 25.7 ± 2.8 nm and 22.5
± 2.15 nm in diameter, respectively (Figure 1d–f, n = 50). Single
units (∼3 nm diameter) organized as tiny threadlike or chainlike
nanostructures formed a dense framework in the background along with
the dispersed spherical assemblies (Figure 1e inset). Sample buffer (5 mM HEPES) used
as a control did not yield any evident substructures (Figure S1).

2.3 P26 and
P32 Controlled Apatite Crystal Nucleation
and Size in Solution
Building on our findings regarding the
peptide assemblies, we further investigated the effects of P26 and
P32 on Ca–P mineralization in vitro using TEM (after 25 min
and 24 h). In the control samples with CaP only (no peptides), spherical
ACP45 was seen within 25 min of mineralization
and verified with mineral phase identification using selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) (Figure 2a). After 24 h of aging at room temperature (RT), random
aggregates of large, mature, rhombohedral or rounded platelike crystals
of different size and well-defined crystal edges were observed in
control (length (l) = 82.3 ± 32.9 nm; maximum
width of crystals was up to 800 nm, n = 55) (Figure 2b). When peptides
P26 and P32 (0.2 mg/mL) were added to CaP, several agglomerates (networks)
of amorphous lamellalike structures were detected after 25 min of
aging (Figure 2d,g).
The density of the scattered nanostructures observed on the surface
of the grids was relatively higher than that of the control (without
peptide) suggesting that peptides accelerated crystal nucleation.
Addition of peptides resulted in the formation of smaller, thin, platelike
HAP crystals of relatively uniform size distribution after 24 h of
aging (Figure 2e,h).
In general, the HAP particles formed in the presence of peptides were
smaller than those in the control (P26 (l): 42.7
± 13.5 nm; P32 (l): 66.2 ± 23.3 nm, n = 55, p < 0.001). The crystals formed
in the presence of P26 were smaller in size than those formed in the
presence of P32.

P32: TEM
images, corresponding SAED images and in situ micro Raman spectroscopy
analyses of mineral phases formed during in vitro mineralization experiments
in the absence (a–c) and presence of (0.2 mg/mL) peptides P26
(d–f) and P32 (g–i).

In situ Raman spectra collected continuously up to 3 h of
mineralization
revealed initial peaks of ACP for all three samples (Figure 2c,f,i). The peak center positions
were fitted by Gaussian functions, and phase transformation (ACP to
HAP) was monitored by peak shift from ∼954 ± 1 to 959
± 1.46,47 The phase transformation start time points
for the control, P26, and P32 was captured at 55.88, 64.88, and 58
min, respectively. After 90 min, HAP crystals appeared in all the
samples, and the intensity for HAP peaks (∼958 cm–1) in control (Figure 2c) was stronger and more distinct than the mineral peaks detected
in the presence of the peptides (Figure 2f,i), which in accordance with TEM may indicate
presence of larger apatite crystals in control. Full-length recombinant
amelogenin (rP172), used for comparison, strongly inhibited apatite
formation for up to 18 h, as seen under Raman spectroscopy (Figure S2). The spectra for rP172 revealed strong
amide peaks at 1255 cm–1 (amide III) and 1669 cm–1 (amide I), corroborating the presence of organic
components in the in situ calcium phosphate solution. A weak amide
I peak at ∼1645 cm–1 was revealed in P32
while such a peak was not detected for P26 (Figure 2i). The low concentration (200 μg/mL)
and small size of the peptides (∼3.5 kDa) make it difficult
to obtain strong amide peaks in Raman spectroscopy when compared to
the full-length recombinant amelogenin (∼25 kDa). The low amide
I signal or lack of it may well be the result of differences in the
binding affinity of P26 with HAP. Collectively, TEM, SAED, and in
situ Raman spectroscopy analyses of sample solutions containing the
peptides were similar in nature and consistent with the formation
of HAP (Figure 2).

2.4 P26 and P32 Improved Preferential Orientation
of Apatite Crystals Formed on Etched Enamel
XRD was used
to estimate the preferential orientation of the regenerated crystals
bound to the enamel surface after application of different peptides. Figure 3a depicts the tooth
specimens after 2 days of peptide treatment, showing XRD peaks at
2θ = 31.8°(211), 32.8°(300), 46.7°(222), and
39.7°(310). The intensity of the diffraction peaks was calculated
by a peak separation process according to Gaussian fit. After two
days of peptide treatment, clear diffraction peaks at (211) and (300)
were obtained that matched the peaks expected for HAP (JCPDF #09-0432).
Full-length amelogenin revealed an indistinct broadened peak (∼32°)
lacking the characteristic diffraction pattern of HAP, indicating
that the regenerated crystals lacked long-range atomic
order and were in a less ordered state. This could be attributed to
the role of recombinant amelogenin in stabilizing transient mineral
phases over a longer duration. The control sample treated in artificial
saliva without peptides only showed a weak broadened (211) peak, indicating
either smaller crystallite size (compared to the peptide-treated crystals)
or poor crystallinity.

Figure 3b
depicts
the tooth specimens after 7 days of treatment, showing diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 25.9°(002), 31.8°(211), 32.8°(300),
and 39.8°(310). A distinct (002) peak appears in P26-, P32-,
and rP172-treated samples, indicating preferential c-axis growth, corresponding to the long axis of the crystals and
perpendicular to the enamel surface (Figure 3b). The 002 direction is the main preferential
orientation for HAP crystals in bulk enamel prisms, with the c-axial growth along the long axis of the tooth and perpendicular
to the dentin–enamel junction.48 The ratio of the diffraction intensities (002) at 25.9° to
another direction (211) was used to determine the degree of orientation
along the c-axis. In previous studies, the intensity
ratio of (002) to (211) (I002/I211) for random HAP (JCPDF #09-0432) was recorded
at 0.4, for enamel control at 0.37, and for CaP/F/rP172 coating (calcium
phosphate–fluoride–amelogenin) at 1.38.49 After 7 days of remineralization the intensity ratios of I002/I211 for the
control, P26, P32, and rP172 groups were 0.44, 2.38, 1.34, and 1.31,
respectively (Figure 3c). This finding indicates that the preferential orientation of the
apatite crystals in the newly formed layer was stronger in the presence
of the amelogenin-derived peptides.

2.5 P26 and
P32 Promoted the Formation of Multilayered
Aprismatic Crystals with Improved Mechanical Properties
After
incubating the peptide-treated tooth specimens in physiologically
relevant artificial saliva solution for different time periods (2
and 7 days), the morphology and the composition of the regrown apatite-containing
layer was observed using SEM and EDXS. After 2 h of demineralization
at pH 4.6 and at 37 °C, the enamel rods (∼5 μm diameter)
and remnants of the interrod material were clearly visible on the
smoothened enamel surface (Figure 4a). The interprismatic enamel was demineralized, making
the outlines of the prisms appear more distinct. In control enamel
slices (no peptides) bathed in artificial saliva for 2 days, the crystals
appeared irregular, porous, and randomly distributed, and had a low
packing crystal density (Figure 4b). There was a notable difference in the uniformity
of the crystal distribution and orientation between the control and
peptide-treated samples.

are magnified images (scale = 500 nm). White arrows in (c) represent
bundles of needlelike crystallites, whereas the arrows in (d,e) show
crystallites aligned parallel to the underlying native enamel.

To evaluate the orientation of
the initial crystal layer grown
in peptide solutions, we looked at areas of relatively low crystal
density. Figure 4c
shows a P26-treated sample after incubation in artificial saliva for
2 days. We observed rapid crystal overgrowth (ca. ≤100 nm width),
characterized by bundles of needlelike crystals emerging perpendicular
to the enamel surface and covering the entire surface of the demineralized
enamel. Apatite crystals formed in the P32-treated samples for 2 days
(ca. ≤100 nm width) grew parallel to the underlying prismatic
enamel (Figure 4d).
Here, we observed the patterning of incipient crystals along the prismatic
enamel via epitaxial crystal growth. We used full-length recombinant
amelogenin (rP172) for comparison in our in situ experiments (Figure 4e). The crystals
regulated by the full-length protein were the longest (ca. ≥2
μm length; ca. ≤100 nm in width) and grew in a manner
similar to the crystals grown with P32, that is, preferentially parallel
to the long axis of the native enamel crystals. The initial distribution
of the first layer of regrown crystals observed after 2 days was more
heterogeneous, with some areas appearing denser than others. However,
as mineralization progressed, a dense crystal layer coated the entire
treated enamel surface.

To determine whether repeated peptide
applications could increase
the thickness of the mineralized layer, we reapplied the peptides
to the tooth specimens on day 3 and observed the outcome at the end
of day 7 of the remineralization cycle (n = 5 per
group). Samples treated with artificial saliva only (no peptides)
showed a single layer (∼10 μm thickness) of randomly
organized crystals that chipped easily and displayed a rough, irregular
surface in the cross-sectional view. At the interface, there was no
attachment to the underlying native enamel and several areas depicted
porosity/irregularities in mineral formation (Figure 5a,b). The alignment of apatite crystals was
poor, showing varying lengths and dimensions. rP172-treated samples
demonstrated a dense coating with long, needlelike crystallites (up
to 15 μm thickness) bound firmly to the underlying enamel prisms
(Figure 5c,d). There
was uniformity in the thickness of the deposited crystals and, unlike
the control without peptides, a smooth mineral surface was observed.

saliva in pH 7.0 at 37 °C. (a) Cross-sectional view of the control
sample (without peptide) shows an irregular, roughened surface with

(d) Magnified image of the square in panel (c) displays long, needlelike
crystallites bound firmly to the underlying enamel prisms (white arrows).

Remarkably, enamel surfaces treated
with multiple applications
of peptides showed a dense, continuous coating, forming multiple (2–4)
columnlike apatite layers of ∼6 μm each (n = 5 samples per group). The total maximum thickness of the multilayered
apatite was approximately 30 μm and grew preferentially along
the apatite crystal c-axis (Figure 6a,b). Polishing and etching the tooth samples
for 10 s with 37% phosphoric acid revealed multiple smaller layers
of homogeneous dimensions (∼6 μm thick each), forming
seamless interfaces with each other and showing few signs of delamination
from the underlying enamel structure (Figure 6c,d). We observed similar growth of multilayered,
columnlike, oriented mineral with an improved interface attachment
on samples treated with P32. A rigorous 10 min sonication in a water
bath ensured that only the crystals that were tightly bound to the
enamel surface were retained and characterized. The results of EDXS
analysis of three points per sample (n = 3) on the
samples treated for 7 days indicated an elemental composition similar
to that of healthy enamel (Figure 6e,f). The Ca/P (weight %) molar ratios of healthy enamel
and demineralized enamel were 1.84 ± 0.16 and 1.88 ± 0.33,
respectively. The analysis of the repaired enamel sample layers showed
Ca/P (weight %) of 1.77 ± 0.88, 1.85 ± 0.86, and 1.74 ±
0.05 for P26-, P32-, and rP172-treated samples, respectively (Figure 6g).

multiple columnar-like layers of smaller thickness dimensions is observed.
(d) Magnified image of panel (c) (yellow square) depicts the presence
of a continuous interface even after the etching cycle. EDXS analysis
of sound enamel (e) and 7 day peptide-treated enamel surface (f) exhibited
elemental peaks for Ca, P, C, Na, and O. Peptide-treated samples incubated
in artificial saliva also exhibited peaks for Mg and F. (g) Ca/P content
(wt %) for the various samples after the 7 day incubation cycle was
found to be comparable to that of healthy enamel.

Figure 7 shows
the
hardness (7a) and elastic modulus (7b) of the regenerated layers of HAP determined using
nanoindentation equipment, measured parallel to the c-axis of the new crystals. Demineralizing enamel slices for 2 h resulted
in significant erosion and reduction in mechanical strength. After
a 7 day mineralization cycle, there was no improvement in the mechanical
properties of samples treated with artificial saliva only (control).
However, regenerated crystals grown in P26 exhibited a 1.7-fold increase
in elastic modulus (Figure 7b) and a 1.8-fold increase in hardness (Figure 7a) compared to demineralized enamel. For
tooth samples treated in P32, a 1.8-fold increase in elastic modulus
and a 1.9-fold increase in hardness were observed compared to demineralized
enamel. The increase in mechanical property values in peptide-treated
demineralized enamel slices was statistically significant (p ≪ 0.05). The modulus and hardness of the regenerated
enamel-like layers were measured at a depth of 2 μm and were
comparable to the modulus (51 ± 4.92 GPa) and hardness (2.79
± 0.38 GPa) of sound tooth enamel (Figure 7). Both peptides exhibited improvement in
mechanical properties compared to the control (without peptides) (p < 0.001). However, differences in modulus and hardness
between the P26- and P32-treated layers were not statistically significant
(p > 0.05).

modulus between etched and repaired enamel (p ≤

3 Discussion
The importance of developing alternative strategies for tooth enamel
repair has been highlighted in dental research and clinical dentistry.50 On the basis of in vitro investigations and
animal models of enamel biomineralization, we have a better understanding
of the structure, function, and assembly of enamel extracellular matrix
components such as amelogenin. Our present study uses the application
of rationally designed, amelogenin-inspired peptides with retained
functional domains to promote regeneration of an apatitic mineralized
layer on etched human tooth enamel. We demonstrate that repeated peptide
applications can promote oriented nucleation of layers of apatite
crystals on sectioned human molars, forming a seamless interface with
the underlying native enamel. The hardness and elastic modulus of
the multilayered aprismatic crystals were greater than the demineralized
enamel and the layers that grew in the absence of peptides.

In developing dental enamel, the bulk of the hydrophobic macromolecular
compartment in the extracellular matrix consists of amelogenin and
relies on acidic hydrophilic proteins (enamelin) to initiate nucleation.
In our study, the synthetic peptides demonstrated the potential to
spontaneously agglomerate into stable nanospherical assemblies that
formed a dense framework of threadlike structures through functional
motifs in the peptide primary structure. The charged hydrophilic peptides
used in the in vitro mineralization experiments were effective in
controlling the formation of smaller HAP crystallites.

Three-dimensional
organic scaffolds have been previously tested
to target surface remineralization of HAP in enamel28 and in bone tissues.51 We used
amelogenin-derived biomimetic peptide scaffolds to control and guide
nucleation events on demineralized enamel surfaces in artificial saliva,
while exercising control over the size and orientation of the developing
HAP crystals by adsorbing on specific crystal surfaces. The hydrophilic
inner N-terminus and C-terminus present in P26 and P32 constitute
the active apatite-binding domains of amelogenin. Through binding
to the surface of enamel, these functional domains generated the high
degree of local supersaturation required for mineral nucleation via
ionic interactions with calcium (pI < pH).52 Fluoride, incorporated into the artificial saliva solution, likely
acted in conjunction with the amelogenin peptides, resulting in the
oriented growth of needlelike apatite crystals, as was observed previously
with full-length amelogenin.49 We observed
areas where the new crystallites grew along the ends of the enamel
prisms, constituting a “transition zone” to a more perpendicularly
stacked crystal overgrowth. Over time, these subsequent crystalline
layers exhibited an accelerated growth transition toward the c-axis (002), forming a columnlike layered architecture
(schematically represented in Figure 8). Geometric selection phenomenon may contribute to
the growth of columnar, layered structures promoted by the addition
of peptides, where for each crystal unit that favors the HAP crystal
to grow along their fastest growth direction (crystallographic c-axis).53,54 Note that other nongeometric
factors, such as direct access to fresh salivary nutrients in advance
of the growing crystal interface, may also dictate texture or orientation.
As the in situ remineralization cycle advanced, the crystals grew
rapidly in the presence of the peptides and mutually encroached to
compete for spaces and nutrients in the artificial saliva chamber.
Clearly, the crystal size, morphology, and orientation within the
remineralized layers were guided by the organic constituents (peptides),
forming multiple smaller sublayers of limited thickness. The influence
of peptides in controlling crystal dimensions was further corroborated
by the in vitro experiments, where we observed smaller HAP crystal
distribution in contrast to the predominantly large, heterogeneous,
platelike crystals seen in the control (without peptides).

Figure 8 Schematic illustration
depicting peptide-mediated regrowth of aprismatic
enamel-like HAP layers on an in situ tooth model system.

Repeated peptide application on tooth slices (on
days 1 and 3 of
the 7 day remineralization cycle) immersed in fresh salivary solution
induced the epitaxial growth of HAP on the previously grown layers
and improved the degree of orientation of the regenerated synthetic
enamel. The intensity of 002 signals of HAP grown with peptides increased
over the 7 day remineralization cycle. This growth mechanism led to
the formation of oriented enamel-like HAP layers on the surface of
the peptide-treated demineralized enamel (Figure 8). An example of competitive crystal growth
in nature is the biomineralization of mollusk shells composed of aragonite
or calcite crystals.55 This type of growth
pattern occurs as aragonite crystal constructs a varying microarchitecture
of superimposed layers embedded in an organic framework with excellent
mechanical strength and fracture toughness. A fluoride ion and d-aspartic acid formulation was used to produce multilayered c-axis-oriented fluorapatite nanorods on polymer sheets
through geometric selection, resulting in controlled crystal dimensions
via selective adsorption of aspartic acid on the a faces.56

The regenerated apatite
formed by the end of the remineralization
cycle in our study had a composition (i.e., Ca/P ratio) comparable
to those of native enamel. The parallel arrangement of the newly formed
crystallites reflected a strong resemblance to the “bandlike”
or “steplike” prismless shapes seen in the outer aprismatic
enamel (16–45 μm in thickness) of the permanent dentition.6 This unique arrangement of dense crystallites
oriented in parallel arrays (Figure 9) has a functional role in vivo in providing fortification
against acid permeability because of the absence of interprismatic
spaces. Whether such protective function can be fulfilled by enamel
regrown with P32 or P26 remains to be validated in future studies
and will require further characterization of the regenerated layers
after subjecting them to acid challenges. Even if P26 resulted in
smaller crystals than those grown in the presence of P32 in vitro,
HAP layers grown with P32 and P26 in situ shared structural and organizational
similarities. It is possible that greater proline repeats are required
to cause significant changes in crystal dimensions within the newly
formed layers in situ.43 To promote prolonged
adsorption of the peptides on active dental lesions and achieve greater
reproducibility, we have contemplated the feasibility of repeated
applications of an antimicrobial, muco-adhesive, peptide–chitosan
hydrogel in customized trays (in preparation). This prototype has
been tested in previous mineralization studies using full-length amelogenin
(rP172)32 and LRAP,33 demonstrating promise for treating incipient carious lesions.

layer showing perpendicularly stacked HAP crystals with an orientation

aprismatic enamel-like HAP layers grown in the presence of amelogenin-inspired
peptide in our experiments for 7 days in situ.

To improve the robustness of next-generation biomimetic materials,
the driving factors that influence the biomechanical strength of intricate
tissues such as dental enamel must be understood. After subjecting
healthy enamel slices to a harsh 2 h-long acid-treatment cycle (pH
4.6) and treating them with peptides, there was ∼2-fold increase
in the mechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) of peptide-treated
samples when compared to that of demineralized enamel. We assert that
peptide-regulated oriented growth of crystals on demineralized enamel
(seen in XRD) and control of crystal size may lead to increases in
hardness and modulus of the newly grown mineralized layers.

The preferred orientation values at selected tooth locations (molar
cusp tips and incisor edges) are dictated by nature to impart strength
required to meet the mechanical needs of the teeth. That is to say,
the areas of the tooth enamel that bear the highest loads are conferred
with the most favorable orientation of crystals linked along their c-axes (aprismatic).57 Previous
studies have indicated that tooth enamel hardness may also be influenced
by controlling the size of the apatite crystals grown along the c-axis.58 In aging permanent
teeth, we observe larger carbonated apatite (CAP) enamel crystals59 that seem softer and less wear-resistant than
smaller CAP enamel crystals.60 Materials
with smaller crystallite size impede propagation of dislocations and
require greater stress to move dislocations across a grain boundary.
This imparts superior yield strength and modulus to the material.
Both our in vitro and in situ studies indicated the tendency of the
peptides to form smaller crystallites. The role of the inverse correlation
between crystal size and hardness warrants further research, as it
may shed light on how peptides such as P26 and P32 regulate crystal
formation, crystallinity and refine the mechanical behavior of the
regenerated mineralized layers. Such efforts could potentially provide
inspiration for the development of enhanced biomaterials in restorative
dentistry.

4 Conclusions
Our work highlights opportunities
to design bioinspired peptides
for tissue engineering and repair, made possible by the discovery
of functional domains within native proteins. We elucidate how amelogenin-inspired
peptides with conserved domains can mediate the organized growth of
aprismatic enamel-like layers in situ while providing the means to
improve the mechanical response of the new layers. P32 (with two extra
polyproline repeats) differed from P26 in the structural dimensions
of peptide assemblies and crystal size in vitro, although in situ
the two peptides produced HAP layers with similar crystal morphology
and mechanical performance. Building on these findings, exploring
other functional domains capable of controlling peptide assembly,
crystal size, and orientation can help refine biomaterial design.
Further challenges remain in attaining the level of scalability (microns
to millimeters), structural hierarchy, and durability of native enamel
to augment next-generation bulk materials for clinical applications.

Ultimately, a systematic understanding of enamel matrix biology
with its multifaceted cooperative interactions between assembling
matrix proteins, enzymes, and mineral ions can provide a valuable
foundation for the development of enamel-like biomaterials associated
with functionality.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Preparation of Synthetic Peptides and Full-Length
Amelogenin rP172
The rationally designed peptides, P26 and
P32, were synthesized commercially at ∼95.13% purity by CHEMPEPTIDE
Limited (Shanghai, China). The peptides were phosphorylated at serine-16.
High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were
used for peptide purification and mass determination by the company
prior to shipment (Table 1). Recombinant full-length porcine amelogenin (rP172) lacking
the N-terminal methionine and the phosphate group on serine-16 was
used for comparison. rP172 was expressed in Escherichia
coli and purified as previously described.17 The peptide and protein samples were weighed
and dissolved in filtered distilled water (DDW, Optima, Fisher Scientific)
to yield stock solutions of 2 mg/mL and centrifuged (8000 rpm, 2 min).
The stock solutions were placed in a slow shaker for 4 h and divided
into aliquots of 100 μL/tube. The aliquots were lyophilized
for 12 h at −80 °C, and the final concentrations of the
synthetic peptides and rP172 were 0.2 mg/tube.

5.2 Characterization
of Secondary Structures by
CD
Samples of P26 and P32 (0.2 mg/mL) were dissolved in 5
mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 for 5 min at RT. CD spectra were collected
in high-transparency quartz cuvettes with a path length of 1 mm and
band width of 2 nm at 25 °C in the far UV spectral range (190–250
nm) using a JASCO J-815 circular dichroic spectrometer. The experiments
were conducted using the peptides in the absence and presence of calcium
ions (3 and 10 mM CaCl2). Conformational changes in the
secondary structure of the peptides in the presence of bivalent calcium
ions were investigated at pH 7.4.

5.3 Characterization
of Spherical Assemblies by
TEM
The peptides (0.2 mg) were dissolved in 5 mM HEPES buffer
(1 mL) for 40 min, and the final pH value was adjusted to 7.4 using
1 M NaOH at RT. Peptide samples (4 μL) were applied to the surface
of the grid (400 mesh carbon-coated, Ted Pella Inc, USA) for 30 s,
blotted with filter paper, and rinsed with water, followed by a 20
s immersion in 2% uranyl acetate solution and air-drying. Three sets
of sample grids (control with no peptides, P26, and P32) were examined
using TEM (JEOL 1400) operated at 100 kV. The morphology and diameter
of the assembled nanospheres were analyzed with software (Gatan Microscopy
Suite).

5.4 Apatite Mineralization Experiments in the
Presence of Peptides
For TEM, stock solutions of 30 mM calcium
and 110 mM phosphate were prepared using reagents CaCl2·2H2O (ChemPure Brand) and KH2PO4 (EM Science). Mineralization experiments were repeated three times.
The pH of the phosphate solution was adjusted to ∼7.4 at RT.
All solutions were filtered three times (Millex-GV, 0.22 μm
filter unit) prior to use. The samples (100 μL) of P26 and P32
were prepared at 0.2 mg/mL concentration. Aliquots of phosphate and
calcium were sequentially added to the solutions to adjust the final
concentrations to 3 mM Ca and 11 mM P. The high concentration of phosphate
also acted as a buffer, and the initial pH values recorded for all
the solutions were ∼7.24–7.34. After mixing all the
components in Eppendorf tubes, the solutions were vortexed and then
centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000 rpm to remove any impurities.
The mineralization experiments were stopped at 25 min and 24 h. Four
microliters of the crystal suspension was placed on the surface of
TEM grids after mixing and dried with filter paper from the side.
Samples were imaged within 1 to 2 h as described above when operated
at 200 kV. In the mineralization experiments, the majority of the
apatite crystals formed an “edge-on” or “face-on”
orientation on the TEM grid surface. Three sets of sample grids (control
with no peptides, P26, and P32) were prepared in duplicates. Images
were obtained in bright field and SAED modes using TEM (JEOL-2100)
operated at 200 kV.61 The dimension of
the apatite crystals was analyzed based on an accumulative reading
of 55 measurements from each set using software (Gatan Microscopy
Suite, digital micrograph coupled with TEM CCD camera).

5.5 In Situ Raman Spectroscopy
Raman
spectroscopy was used to investigate the mineral phase transformation
during HAP crystallization in samples with and without the peptides.
The concentrations of the peptides were 0.2 mg/mL at pH 7.4. The concentrations
of calcium and phosphate were 1.5 and 9.5 mM, respectively. The Raman
spectra were collected continuously up to 3 h, from 100 to 4000 cm–1 under backscattering geometry using a Raman microscope
(HORIBA Scientific, Japan, equipped with LabRAM ARAMIS) operated at
a resolution of 1 cm–1 with an excitation wavelength
of 532 nm and laser power of 2.5 mW. A 60× objective with numerical
aperture of 0.75 was used to focus the sample and to collect the spectra
for 20 s.

5.6 Tooth Sample Preparation
Healthy
human molars (extracted using standard procedures at the Herman Ostrow
School of Dentistry of the University of Southern California and handled
with the approval of the Institutional Review Board) were collected.
Excess soft tissue deposits and calculus were removed by cleaning
with a tweezer and scaling. The teeth were rinsed in 70% ethanol,
placed in DDW for a 20 min sonication, and stored in diluted phosphate-buffered
saline (pH 7.4) with 0.002% sodium azide (microbial inhibitor) at
4 °C for further use. Prior to running the experiments, the teeth
were cut longitudinally into 2 mm thick slices with a water-cooled
diamond wheel saw (MTI Corporation, SYJ 150-A, USA). The slices were
sequentially polished with a series of 400–4000 grit silicon
carbide papers and nylon adhesive back discs with 0.50 μm colloidal
silica suspension. The polished enamel slices were thoroughly rinsed
with DDW, sonicated in a water bath for 5 min, and stored in DDW at
4 °C for further use.

5.7 Enamel Regrowth on Demineralized
Tooth Slices
A 3 × 2 mm window was prepared on each
enamel slice by coating
the remaining surfaces with acid-resistant nail varnish. The dried
tooth samples were exposed to a demineralization buffer (2 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 2 mM KH2PO4,
50 mM sodium acetate, and 0.879 mL acetic acid) at pH 4.6 for 2 h
at 37 °C, then rinsed, and ultrasonically cleaned for 5 min to
remove any remnants of a smear layer. One milliliter of calcium phosphate
solution (960 μL of DW, 25 μL of 0.1 M CalCl2, and 15 μL of 0.1 M Na2HPO4) was added
to the peptide sample (0.2 mg), and the pH was adjusted to a final
value of 7.2. The demineralized enamel windows were then coated with
20 μL of peptide solutions (P26, P32, and rP172) followed by
drying in the desiccator for 10 min at RT. Peptide-coated tooth slices
were immersed in 5 mL of artificial saliva (1.2 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 50 mM HEPES buffer, 0.72 mM KH2PO4, 16 mM KCl, 4.5 mM NH4Cl, 0.2 mM MgCl2·6H20, and 1 ppm F) at pH 7.0 at 37 °C
for up to 7 days. Repeated peptide applications were performed on
days 1 and 3 of this 7 day remineralization period. The artificial
saliva was replenished every 24 h. After incubation, the tooth slices
were sonicated in a water bath for 10 min, rinsed with deionized water,
and air-dried before examination under XRD, SEM, EDXS, and nanoindentation.
In total, there were 4 groups of five samples each: control (no peptide)
and those treated with P26, P32, and rP172 (for comparison).

5.8 Analysis and Imaging of the in Situ Regrown
Crystals on Tooth Enamel
5.8.1 X-ray Diffraction
XRD (Rigaku diffractometer,
Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.542 Å) operating at 70 kV and 50 mA with a sampling step
of 0.08 and 2θ of range 5–65° was used to analyze
the enamel windows (3 × 2 mm) for crystal orientation and mineral
phase of the newly formed crystals.

5.8.2 Scanning
Electron Microscopy
Field
emission SEM (JEOL JSM-7001F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) imaging was
used to observe the regrown crystals for structural analysis after
the in situ remineralization cycle. Specimens were mounted on aluminum
stubs with a carbon tape. The tooth surfaces were sputtered with Au
and observed under an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Both top–down
and side views of the sectioned tooth samples were observed using
SEM. Element analysis and mineral content was measured after the 7
day remineralization cycle using an energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis
detector coupled to the SEM (JEOL 7001SEM-EDX). In each sample, three
measuring points were selected at 3000× magnification, with a
measuring time of 200 s at 10 kV (n = 3).

To
observe the cross section of the newly formed layers, the tooth slices
were embedded in resin. The mold space was filled with a thin layer
of self-curing polymer resin and moistened with a drop of the monomer.
Each tooth section was placed parallel to the mold space to guarantee
the precision of the section, and the resin was poured into the remaining
space using the salt and pepper method. The resin was cured for up
to 2 h at RT. The blocks were extracted from the plastic mold and
a longitudinal cut was made through the window (using a diamond saw
advancing at low speed). The cross sections were again sequentially
polished with wet grid papers using gentle
force, rinsed in ethanol, sonicated in water, and rinsed thoroughly.
The samples were then prepared for SEM analysis, as described above.

5.8.3 Mechanical Properties
The hardness
and elastic modulus of the peptide-mediated mineralized layers were
evaluated by nanoindentation tests. A Berkovich diamond indentation
tip (with a curvature less than 100 nm) was used to make indentations
on the sample surface. A continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) was
used to measure the hardness (strength) and the elastic modulus (stiffness)
of the regrown apatite layers. The following parameters were used
in CSM mode: target constant strain rate of 0.05 s–1, measuring depth up to 2 μm, and the distance between the
indentations maintained at 100 μm to prevent interference. Four
different groups (healthy enamel, demineralized enamel, P26-, and
P32-treated enamel) were measured (n = 5 per group).
Twenty-five indentations were recorded for each sample. Student’s t-test was applied to identify differences in the hardness
and elastic modulus between etched and repaired enamel (p ≤ 0.05). All the statistical analyses were carried out using
software (Origin 8.0, Origin Lab, Northampton, MA and Microsoft Office
Excel 2007).
