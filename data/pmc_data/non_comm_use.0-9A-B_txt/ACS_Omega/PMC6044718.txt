Antibody–drug
conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of anticancer
therapeutics that combine the selectivity of targeted treatment, ensured
by monoclonal antibodies, with the potency of the cytotoxic agent.
Here, we applied an analogous approach, but instead of an antibody,
we used fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). FGF2 is a natural ligand
of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), a cell-surface receptor
reported to be overexpressed in several types of tumors. We developed
and characterized FGF2 conjugates containing a defined number of molecules
of highly cytotoxic drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). These conjugates
effectively targeted FGFR1-expressing cells, were internalized upon
FGFR1-mediated endocytosis, and, in consequence, revealed high cytotoxicity,
which was clearly related to the FGFR1 expression level. Among the
conjugates tested, the most potent was that bearing three MMAE molecules,
showing that the cytotoxicity of protein–drug conjugates in
vitro is directly dependent on drug loading.

Introduction
More than 100 years
has passed since Paul Ehrlich postulated the
concept of powerful and tailored antitumor drugs termed “magic
bullets”, and fully effective cancer treatment is still being
pursued.1,2 Currently, the most promising approach is
targeted therapy, especially the one based on antibody–drug
conjugates (ADCs) composed of a monoclonal antibody as the targeting
molecule and a highly cytotoxic agent.3−5 A clear advantage of
using antibodies is their ability to recognize virtually any molecular
target, including those present on malignant cells.6,7 However,
there are many other natural ligands that form complexes with specific
cell-surface proteins overexpressed in cancer cells.

One such
group comprises fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which
bind with high affinity to FGF receptors (FGFRs) found to be upregulated
in many types of tumors, including bladder, breast, lung, rhabdomyosarcoma,
and multiple myeloma.8,9 Currently, numerous studies exploit
FGFRs as potential therapeutic targets. The most common approaches
involve the use of small-molecule inhibitors to block the receptor
tyrosine kinase activity, FGF traps, and monoclonal antibodies to
eliminate ligand binding and prevent receptor activation.9−12

Recently, we showed that FGF1 could be effectively applied
to deliver
a cytotoxic agent (monomethyl auristatin E, MMAE) specifically to
FGFR-expressing cells, working as a Trojan horse by sensitizing the
cells to the cytotoxic drug action.13,14 However, FGF1
exhibits a major disadvantage as a delivery vehicle. It is inherently
unstable, and, even upon the introduction of stabilizing mutations,
is prone to unfolding upon covalent attachment of the hydrophobic
drug molecule to its single exposed Cys117 residue.13 To overcome this limitation, we introduced Cys to Ser mutations
and in parallel cysteine-containing specific sequences at the FGF1
N- or C-terminus, which allowed us to attach the cytotoxic cargo through
maleimide chemistry with high yield and specificity. With this approach,
however, we were able to obtain only singly substituted conjugates
of FGF1.13,14 To increase the drug-to-protein ratio (DPR),
here we applied another canonical member of the FGF family, fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2), as the FGFR-targeting molecule.

FGF2
contains four cysteines, two of which are highly exposed,
offering the possibility of addition of two MMAE molecules. Because
FGF2 is more resistant than FGF1 to thermal unfolding, aggregation,
and proteolysis,15−18 we considered that it might tolerate the MMAE molecules attached
directly to its native sequence. In contrast to FGF1, which binds
to all FGFRs, FGF2 exhibits higher specificity being a ligand only
for FGFR1c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4.19,20 Moreover, FGF2 is effectively
endocytosed through an FGFR-dependent mechanism,21,22 and efficient internalization is a key parameter in the case of
delivery systems for highly cytotoxic drugs as it allows for specific
release of the active form of the cytotoxic compound only inside the
target cell.23

In this article, we
describe the design and characterization of
novel cytotoxic conjugates based on the FGF2 molecule and MMAE. These
bioconjugates were effectively internalized and demonstrated a significantly
higher cytotoxicity in cell lines expressing fibroblast growth factor
receptor 1 (FGFR1) than in the control cell line. In our system, the
stoichiometry of the conjugate (DPR) could be controlled precisely
and the number of drug molecules attached correlated positively with
the cytotoxic potency of the FGF2 conjugates.

Results
Design and
Production of FGF2 Variants
Wild-type FGF2
contains four cysteine residues, two of them (Cys34 and Cys101) are
buried and inert and two (Cys78 and Cys96) are exposed and highly
reactive.24 To control the number of drug
molecules attached to FGF2, we constructed several variants that are
shown in Figure 1.
Substitution of the two surface cysteine residues with serines (Cys78Ser
and Cys96Ser) combined with the introduction of the KCKSGG sequence
at the N-terminus or GGSKCK at the C-terminus (in both cases abbreviated
KCK) allowed us to generate two monosubstituted FGF2 conjugates. Wild-type
FGF2 with two exposed cysteines intact should give a doubly substituted
conjugate. To obtain triply substituted conjugates, we used wild-type
FGF2 extended with the KCK sequence on either terminus. The cysteine
residue flanked with lysines is highly reactive and ensures excellent
yield of the conjugation reaction.14

Figure 1 FGF2 constructs
with conjugation sites marked. The asterisks correspond
to the conjugating cysteines and X’s indicate the cysteines
mutated to serines.

We successfully expressed
and purified all FGF2 variants. The yield
was between 8 and 40 mg/L of culture. All of the variants exhibited
highly similar elution profiles during purification on heparin-Sepharose.

Conjugation of FGF2 Variants with MMAE
As a cytotoxic
compound delivered by FGF2, we used maleimidocaproyl-Val-Cit-PABC-monomethylauristatin
E (abbreviated vcMMAE), a highly cytotoxic derivative of dolastatin
containing a maleimide moiety suitable for conjugation to a cysteine
residue and a protease-sensitive valine–citrulline dipeptide
designed for optimal stability in human plasma and effective cleavage
by human cathepsin B.13,25

We optimized the conjugation
reaction to provide high yield and optimal conditions, preventing
protein unfolding and a loss of receptor-binding activity. Different
temperatures (4, 15, 25, 37 °C), reaction times (10, 30 min,
1, 6, and 24 h), buffer compositions, including buffering agents (phosphate,
HEPES, Tris), salts (NaCl, Na2SO4, (NH4)2SO4 at a concentration range of 0–1
M), and pHs (6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0) were tested. Finally, for all protein
variants, the conjugation was performed for 1 h at 25 °C in the
reaction buffer containing 50 mM monosodium phosphate, 10 mM Na2SO4, 10 mM methionine, and 1 mM EDTA, at pH 7.0.
When vcMMAE was added to FGF2 WT, its two exposed cysteines were substituted
and the other two remained unmodified (Figures 2 and S1). Also,
in all of the other FGF2 constructs, the two buried cysteines were
not reactive and the expected drug molecule loading was achieved (DPR
value from 1 to 3) (Figures 2 and S1). The conjugation gave
highly homogenous preparations containing negligible amounts of the
unconjugated species, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) (Figure 2a). The identity of the conjugates was confirmed
by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–mass spectrometry
(MALDI–MS) (Figure 2b). However, this technique did not allow us to withdraw unequivocal
conclusion on DPR due to the fact that some vcMMAE moieties split
off during the ionization/desorption process.26 The homogeneity of conjugates and their DPR were further confirmed
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quantitative analysis
(Figures 2a and S1, Table S1). All but one FGF2 conjugate were
soluble; the triply loaded variant with the C-terminus extended (FGF2-KCK-(vcMMAE)3) precipitated in PBS and was therefore excluded from further
experiments.

before (upper panel) and after (lower panel) the reaction performed
for 1 h at 25 °C, as detailed in Materials
and Methods. Numbers of MS data correspond to the lane numbers
in (A).

To verify the native conformation
of the FGF2 variants before and
after conjugation, we performed fluorescence analysis (Figure 3a), which is a useful indicator
of proper folding of FGF2.27 The fluorescence
spectrum of natively folded wild-type FGF2 shows very low emission
at 353 nm because the signal from the single tryptophan residue is
completely quenched and the spectrum is dominated by emission of tyrosine
residues (maximum at 303 nm). Upon unfolding (with a denaturating
agent such as SDS), the quenching effect is abolished, resulting in
a significant increase of fluorescence at 353 nm (Figure 3a). The fluorescence emission
spectra of all of the proteins before and after conjugation were similar
to those of native FGF2 WT, showing no changes in the tertiary structure
of the variants and their conjugates with vcMMAE.

at a protein concentration of 4 × 10–6 M upon
excitation at 280 nm. Curves were normalized to tyrosine emission
at 303 nm. (B) Activation of FGFR1 (phospho-FGFR1) and ERK 1/2 (phospho-p44/42

variants or their conjugates in the presence of 10 U/mL heparin detected
by Western blotting. Total amount of FGFR1, ERK 1/2 (p44/42 MAPK),
and γ-tubulin served as loading control.

Biological Competence of FGF2 Variants and Their Conjugates
To verify if the introduced mutations (Cys to Ser substitutions
and N- and C-terminal extensions) or vcMMAE conjugation did not affect
the binding of the FGF2 derivatives to FGFRs, we analyzed activation
of signaling pathways in NIH 3T3 cells upon a 15 min treatment with
the modified FGF2. All of the conjugates stimulated the downstream
signaling at the same level as did FGF2 WT, as detected by Western
blotting with anti-phospho-ERK 1/2 antibodies and anti-phospho-FGFR1
(Figure 3b). This result
indicates that the introduced modifications of FGF2 not only did not
affect the protein conformation but also did not impair the short-term
FGF-induced cellular response. We also analyzed the binding of selected
conjugates to the recombinant extracellular part of FGFR1c using Biolayer
interferometry (BLI; Figure 4, Table 1).
This in vitro method of protein–protein interaction measurements
revealed some variations (within 1 order of magnitude range) in the
binding parameters of the wild-type FGF2 and FGF2 conjugates. The
mean dissociation constant for wild-type FGF2 was equal to 2.43 ×
10–10 M, whereas for conjugates, it was in the range
from 4.43 × 10–10 to 20.8 × 10–10 M, with the highest value for triply substituted conjugate.

Internalization of FGF2-vcMMAE Conjugates
Because the
main aim of our study was the specific delivery of the cytotoxic cargo
into FGFR-positive cells, we checked whether the FGF2 conjugates are
able to enter the cell, using confocal microscopy. Two FGF2 conjugates,
KCK-FGF2[C78S/C96S]-(vcMMAE)1 (DPR = 1) and KCK-FGF2-(vcMMAE)3 (DPR = 3) were labeled with fluorescent dye DyLight 550.
The endocytic uptake was analyzed in U2OS cells stably expressing
FGFR1 (U2OS-R1) and in untransfected cells (U2OS). The untransfected
U2OS cells were prestained with CellTrace Violet and cocultured with
an equal number of nonstained U2OS-R1 cells, which allowed us to discriminate
between the two cell lines on the same coverslip. Both the FGF2 conjugates
produced the DyLight550-specific fluorescence only in U2OS-R1 cells
(Figure 5), and their
cellular distribution was very similar to that of early endosome antigen
1 (EEA1), indicating that their internalization occurs effectively
in an FGFR-dependent manner, similar to that of FGF2 WT.

Figure 5 Specific internalization
of the FGF2 WT and FGF2-vcMMAE conjugates
into the cells expressing FGFR1. Shown are the representative images
of internalization of FGF2 WT, KCK-FGF2[C78S/C96S]-(vcMMAE)1, or KCK-FGF2-(vcMMAE)3 into U2OS-R1 cells vs U2OS cells.
Equal numbers of U2OS cells stably stained with CellTrace Violet (blue)
and U2OS-R1 (nonstained) were grown together and then incubated with
1000 ng/mL FGF2 WT, KCK-FGF2[C78S/C96S]-(vcMMAE)1, or KCK-FGF2-(vcMMAE)3 labeled with DyLight550 (red) at 37 °C for 15 min. The
cells were fixed, stained with anti-EEA1 antibody (green), and examined
by confocal microscopy. U2OS-R1 cells are marked with a dashed line.
The bar corresponds to 10 μm.

To demonstrate the subcellular localization of the internalized
FGF2 and its conjugates, we performed high-resolution microscopy.
U2OS-R1 cells were incubated with FGF2 WT, KCK-FGF2[C78S/C96S]-(vcMMAE)1, or KCK-FGF2-(vcMMAE)3 at 37 °C for 40 min
and then stained using anti-FGF2, anti-FGFR1, and anti-EEA1 antibodies
(Figure 6). In all
three samples, FGF2 and FGFR1 were found to colocalize in intracellular
vesicles, mostly those positive for EEA1, a membrane-bound marker
of early endosomes. Thus, both the conjugates tested, similarly to
WT FGF2, are internalized efficiently by an FGFR1-mediated mechanism
via the endocytic pathway.

of endocytosed
FGF2 WT and FGF2-vcMMAE conjugates in U2OS-R1 cells. U2OS-R1 cells
cultured on glass coverslips were incubated with 500 ng/mL FGF2 WT,
KCK-FGF2[C78S/C96S]-(vcMMAE)1, or KCK-FGF2-(vcMMAE)3 at 37 °C for 40 min to allow for endocytosis. The cells
were stained with anti-FGF2 (green), anti-FGFR1 (red), and anti-EEA1
(white) antibodies and with Hoechst 33342 to visualize DNA. Images
were deconvolved and single optical sections are shown, either as
single-channel (color) images or as overlays as indicated. The bar
corresponds to 4 μm, and in zoomed images, to 2 μm. The
squares marked in four-color overlay images indicate blown-up regions
shown in the bottom row.

Because conjugates containing vcMMAE should undergo cathepsin
B
cleavage, which occurs predominantly in lysosomes, we also checked
whether internalized FGF2-vcMMAE conjugates eventually reached the
lysosomal compartment. Just after 90 min of incubation, we observed
colocalization of FGF2 conjugates with the lysosomal marker, LAMP-1
(Figure S2). These results confirm the
delivery of FGF2 conjugates to lysosomes.

Cytotoxic Effect of FGF2
Conjugates
To assess the toxicity
of the FGF2 conjugates, we used three cell lines differing in the
FGFR1 level: BJ (nonmalignant cells naturally expressing a moderately
high level of FGFR1), U2OS (cells that show a hardly detectable level
of FGFR1 and serve as a negative control), and U2OS-R1 (U2OS cells
stably expressing FGFR1 at a very high level).13 For each cell line, we verified the level of total FGFR1
by Western blot analysis (Figure S3), as
well as the level of FGFR1 accessible for the ligand on the cell surface
by flow cytometry (Figure S4).

The
cells were treated for 96 h with FGF2 WT or four different FGF2 conjugates
in the concentration range of 0.04–4000 nM, and their viability
was assessed with the Alamar Blue assay. The sensitivity toward the
FGF2 conjugates differed considerably between the cell lines and correlated
with the level of FGFR1 on their surface (Figure 7). Remarkably, the toxicity toward the U2OS
cells was roughly 2 orders of magnitude lower than that toward the
U2OS-R1 cells (Table 2). In U2OS-R1 cells, the EC50 values were equal to 2.2
and 4.1 nM for KCK-FGF2-(vcMMAE)3 and FGF2-(vcMMAE)2, respectively. As a control, we used free MMAE at 11 μM,
which exhibited very similar toxicity in all of the cell lines tested
(Figure 7).

Figure 7 Viability of
cells treated with the FGF2 WT and FGF2-vcMMAE conjugates.
BJ, U2OS, and U2OS-R1 cells were treated with indicated agents at
various concentrations for 96 h, and their viability was assessed
with the Alamar Blue assay. For comparison, the effect of free 11
μM MMAE is shown. Results shown are mean values from three experiments

Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between the DPR
and the toxic effect of the conjugates (Figure 7 and Table 2). KCK-FGF2-(vcMMAE)3 revealed the highest
cytotoxicity, whereas singly substituted conjugates (KCK-FGF2[C78S/C96S]-(vcMMAE)1 and FGF2[C78S/C96S]-KCK-(vcMMAE)1) showed the
lowest.

Taken together, our results demonstrate high specificity
and potency
of FGF2-vcMMAE conjugates in killing FGFR1-expressing cells.

Discussion
In recent years, targeted
cancer therapy is becoming a paradigm
for effective cancer treatment. The most developed strategy employs
antibodies that specifically recognize defined molecular markers on
cancer cells.28−31 Only few cases have been reported of using naturally occurring ligands
binding to proteins overexpressed on cancer cells for specific delivery
of a toxic drug. One example is the application of transferrin conjugated
to chemotherapeutic agents, such as adriamycin, daunorubicin, and
metotrexat, or toxins, including ricin and diphtheria toxin.32 Others have proposed a specific delivery strategy
based on folate receptors because its expression is augmented in several
types of cancer.33−36 Folic acid conjugated to doxorubicin-loaded magnetic nanospheres37 or PEG-PLGA copolymer nanoparticles containing
cisplatin and paclitaxel38 destroyed cancer
cells effectively.

In this study, we employed FGF2 as the targeting
molecule to deliver
a cytotoxic compound, MMAE, to the cells presenting FGFR1c on their
surface. This receptor plays a significant role in a wide variety
of human tumors. Several types of cancer, including carcinomas, sarcomas,
and glioblastomas, seem to be a consequence of FGFR1 aberrations,
especially gene amplification, leading to receptor overproduction.39 FGFR1 is relatively often overexpressed in squamous
cell lung cancer (up to 20%), small-cell lung cancer (6%), breast
cancer (10%), head and neck cancer (up to 17%), esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (20%), adenocarcinoma (9%), osteosarcoma (5%), and
ovarian and bladder tumors.39−43

As a model of FGFR-dependent cancer, we used a cell line with
high
expression of FGFR1, U2OS cell stably transfected with FGFR1.44 To produce FGF2 conjugates, we applied well-established
protocols for ADC construction, including the Val-Cit linker and conjugation
chemistry.45−47

Only few attempts to generate conjugates of
FGFs have been published
to date, including a conjugate of FGF2 with PEG and adenoviral vectors,48 attachment of polymers (G5 polyamidoamine dendrimer
or poly(ethylene glycol)-cholesterol polymer) to FGF1 and FGF2,49,50 and two toxin conjugates. Wiedlocha et al. formed an FGF1-diphteria
toxin A chain fusion to study the structural requirements for the
translocation of this growth factor into the cell.51 In another study, a fusion protein composed of FGF2 and
ribosome-inactivating protein, saporin, was shown to be cytotoxic
in melanoma and bladder cell lines.52,53 As far as
we know, only our group has demonstrated successful conjugation of
a FGF family member (FGF1) to a cytotoxic drug (MMAE), achieving effective
killing of cells overexpressing the FGFR.13,14

We propose to use FGF2 as a targeting molecule alternatively
to
antibodies to overcome some limitations of ADC technology. To obtain
an antibody or antibody fragment highly specific to a unique antigen
presented on cancer cells, laborious and expensive selection procedures
are required. Also, it has to be kept in mind that high specificity
and affinity of antibodies to cell-surface receptors may not be enough
to provide their effective internalization and, in consequence, drug
delivery to the target cell.54,55 Moreover, even humanized
antibodies may evoke strong immunogenicity, questioning their therapeutic
application.56 As a natural ligand, FGF2
does not generate immune response, binds strongly to specific FGFRs,
and is efficiently internalized and directed to lysosomes, where it
can release a cytotoxic payload. Production of recombinant FGF2 is
easy, and this protein can be optimized for therapeutic purposes by
protein engineering methods. Besides the above-mentioned FGFR1-related
cancers, FGF2 could be used to target tumors overexpressing FGFR3c,
including colorectal,57 or FGFR4, such
as pancreatic adenocarcinoma,58 colorectal,59 and ovarian cancer.60 Relatively broad specificity of FGF2 may generate side effects,
affecting the normal cells, but usually the number of FGFR molecules
in FGFR-dependent tumors is much higher than the physiological level
found in healthy tissues.61

FGF2
offers major advantage over FGF1. It contains two exposed
and reactive cysteines which, owing to the low tendency of FGF2 to
unfold, can be substituted with two MMAE molecules without disturbing
the protein’s structure and biological activity. A doubly loaded
FGF2 conjugate did not show any tendency to aggregate and preserved
its native conformation, as assessed by fluorescence emission spectra
that are very sensitive to changes in the tertiary structure.27,62 This result encouraged us to increase the cytotoxic drug loading
by introduction of a third MMAE molecule on an FGF2 N-terminus by
extending it with a linker containing the Lys-Cys-Lys sequence. Notably,
although both N- and C-terminally extended FGF2 variants were stable,
upon vcMMAE conjugation, the latter formed aggregates, which precluded
its further study. Thus, we obtained two singly substituted conjugates,
one containing two MMAE molecules and one with the DPR = 3 (Figure 1). We found that
all of them activated the main intracellular signaling cascade similarly
to FGF2 WT, proving that attachment of even three MMAE moieties did
not affect the FGF2 binding to its receptor. We also confirmed that
the FGF2 conjugates were efficiently internalized, reaching first
early endosomes and then lysosomes and enabling the release of the
drug inside the cell. This feature is a prerequisite for effective
action of targeted drug conjugates.63,64

To assess
the cytotoxicity of the conjugates, we used U2OS-R1 cells
overexpresing FGFR1 and BJ cells, which are normal human fibroblasts
expressing FGFR1 at a moderate level, together with untransfected
U2OS cells that express a marginal level of FGFR1 and served as a
control.13 The cells overexpressing the
receptor (U2OS-R1) were killed much more efficiently than BJ cells
(the EC50(BJ)/EC50(U2OS-R1) ratio over 20),
and U2OS cells with little FGFRs were destroyed at several-fold higher
concentrations of the conjugate than BJ cells. These results confirmed
not only the high cytotoxic effect of the FGF2 conjugates in cells
producing FGFR1 but also its correlation with the FGFR1 expression
level.

For the most toxic FGF2 conjugate, that triply substituted
with
MMAE, the EC50 toward U2OS-R1 cells equalled to 2.2 nM. The singly
substituted FGF2 conjugate at the N-terminus was over 4 times more
potent in killing U2OS-R1 cells than the corresponding conjugate of
FGF1 described previously.13 Moreover,
the FGF2 conjugate was less toxic to control cells (U2OS), providing
a wider (by almost 1 order of magnitude) therapeutic window.

The construction of stable FGF2 conjugates with different numbers
of MMAE molecules attached (1, 2, or 3) allowed us also to establish
the dependence of their cytotoxicity effect on the DPR. In both cell
lines, U2OS-R1 and BJ, the conjugates with a higher DPR were more
toxic than the less-loaded ones. Although the accuracy of the EC50 estimation is not high, one may conclude that introduction
of an additional MMAE moiety results in an about 2-fold increase of
the cytotoxic efficiency (Table 2). A similar tendency has been observed for ADCs.65 Recently, this effect was noticed also in in
vivo studies on anti-CD30 antibodies and trastuzumab conjugates with
MMAE.66To conclude, we have obtained defined
cytotoxic conjugates of FGF2 and MMAE, which undergo effective endocytosis
and reveal high toxicity in cells overexpressing FGFR. Moreover, we
have shown that the cell-killing activity of such conjugates is strongly
affected by drug loading.

(West Grove, PA). The following dyes were used: DyLight 550 NHS Ester,
Hoechst 33342, DAPI, CellTrace Violet, and ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant
were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Immobilon-PSQ PVDF
0.2 μm membranes were from EMD Millipore (Germany), Dulbecco’s
PBS and heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa was from
Sigma-Aldrich, and Alamar Blue was from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
MA).

HiTrap Heparin HP columns were from GE Healthcare (U.K.),
and Zeba Spin Desalting columns were from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
MMAE and vcMMAE were from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ).
All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Cell Lines
BJ cells (CRL-2522) were grown in Eagle’s
Minimum Essential Medium from Sigma-Aldrich. U2OS (HTB-96) and U2OS
stably transfected with FGFR1 (U2OS-R1) were grown in McCoy’s
5A Modified Medium from Lonza (Switzerland). All media were supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum from Thermo Fisher Scientific, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin mix was from BioWest (France). Additionally,
the U2OS-R1 cell medium contained 50 μg/mL gentamicin sulfate
from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All cell lines were cultured in a humidified
incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The BJ and
U2OS cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). The U2OS cells stably expressing FGFR1 (U2OS-R1) were
a kind gift from Dr. Ellen M. Haugsten from The Norwegian Radium Hospital.44

Plasmids
The sequence encoding human
FGF2 (residues
1–155) was cloned into the pET-3c expression vector from Stratagene
(La Jolla, CA). N- and C-terminal linkers KCKSGG and GGSKCK and point
mutations C78S and C96S were introduced using a QuikChange Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Four variants differing in
the number of modifiable cysteines were constructed to enable the
synthesis of conjugates with different numbers of drug molecules.

Protein Expression and Purification
Proteins were expressed
in an E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS expression
strain from Novagen-EMD Biosciences (Madison, WI). Bacteria were grown
in a TB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C to OD600 = 0.6. Then, the protein expression was induced by the
addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.3 mM and the culture
was incubated at 25 °C for 12 h. Next, bacteria were harvested
by centrifugation at 8000g, resuspended in lysis
buffer (50 mM monosodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA,
0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.2), and homogenized using French
press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 50 000g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was diluted in binding buffer
(50 mM monosodium phosphate, 0.7 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2)
and loaded on a HiTrap Heparin HP column. The column was washed with
washing buffer (50 mM monosodium phosphate, 1.0 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT,
1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2), and proteins were eluted with a linear 1.0–2.0
M gradient of NaCl in the same buffer.

Conjugation of FGF2 Variants
with vcMMAE
Purified proteins
were desalted to reaction buffer (50 mM monosodium phosphate, 10 mM
Na2SO4, 10 mM methionine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0)
using Zeba Spin Desalting columns. A maleimide derivative of MMAE
(vcMMAE) dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMAc) at 50 mg/mL was added to protein solutions (1.5 mg/mL) to give
a 2-fold molar excess of the drug over protein −SH groups.
The conjugation reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 20 °C.
Reaction progress was monitored by SDS–PAGE and MALDI-time-of-flight
(TOF) MS. Finally, the excess of unconjugated vcMMAE was removed from
the reaction mixture by buffer exchange to Dulbecco’s PBS using
Zeba Spin Desalting columns.

Fluorescence Labeling of
Proteins and Conjugates with DyLight
550
Unmodified wild-type FGF2 and two FGF2-vcMMAE conjugates
were labeled with DyLight 550. DyLight 550 (1 μL) at a concentration
of 1 mg/mL NHS Ester in DMAc was added to 100 μL of purified
proteins or conjugates at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in 50 mM monosodium
phosphate, 10 mM Na2SO4, pH 7.8, and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in the dark. The labeled products
were purified on Zeba Spin Desalting columns to remove unreacted dye.

MS
Molecular masses of proteins and their conjugates
were verified by MALDI-TOF MS (Applied Biosystems AB 4800+) using
α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix.

Spectrofluorimetry
The folded state of proteins and
their conjugates was verified by spectrofluorimetry. The fluorescence
spectra were acquired using an FP-8500 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco,
Japan) with excitation at 280 nm and emission in the 300–450
nm range, at a protein concentration of ∼4 × 10–6 M in Dulbecco’s PBS.

Activation of FGF2 Signaling
Pathways
Serum-starved
NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated for 15 min with 100 ng/mL FGF2 variants
or their conjugates in the presence of heparin (10 U/mL). The cells
were then washed with PBS, lysed with Laemmli Sample Buffer, and sonicated.
The total cell lysate was separated by SDS–PAGE (12%) and analyzed
by Western blotting using the following antibodies: anti-FGFR1, anti-phospho-FGFR1,
anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK, anti-p44/42 MAPK, and anti-γ-tubulin.
All primary antibodies were used at the 1:1000 dilution. Specific
protein bands were visualized with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
and an enhanced chemoluminescence substrate using ChemiDoc station
(BioRad, Hercules, CA).

BLI Analysis of Binding of FGF2 Conjugates
to FGFR1c
Binding measurements were performed using ForteBio
Octet K2 (Pall
ForteBio, Fremont, CA) and high-precision Streptavidin biosensors
(SAX) (Pall ForteBio, Fremont, CA). Studies of interactions between
biotinylated extracellular domains of FGFR1c fused to Fc fragments
and wild-type FGF2 or FGF2 conjugates were performed at 25 °C
in PBS supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (w/v) PEG 3.5 kDa, 0.05%
(v/v) Triton X-100, and 10 mM (NH4)2SO4. Sensor tips were hydrated in buffer for 30 min prior to use. The
wells in 96-microwell plates were filled with 200 μL of either
buffer or sample and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C for system
stabilization. Next, biotinylated FGFR1c was immobilized on the SAX
sensor for 300 s and the sensor was blocked with biocytin (0.04 mg/mL)
for 300 s and washed for 60 s. A reference sensor without the biotinylated
receptor served as a background control. Association of the wild-type
FGF2 and FGF2 conjugates at different concentrations (20, 40, and
80 nM) was carried out for 200 s, and the dissociation was monitored
for 200 s. Kinetic parameters were calculated using a simple 1:1 Langmuir
model with BIAevaluation 4.1 software.

Cell Viability Assays
Cells cultured in 96-well plates
(5000 cells/well in the required media supplemented with 10 U/mL heparin)
were treated with different concentrations of wild-type FGF2 or its
cytotoxic conjugates. After 96 h of continuous exposure to the drug,
the medium was removed and replaced with the fresh medium containing
10% Alamar Blue. Fluorescence emission at 590 nm (excitation at 560
nm), reflecting the viability of the cells, was measured 4 h later
using an EnVision Multilabel Reader fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA). The data were fitted to the Hill equation using Origin
7 software (Northampton, MA) to calculate EC50 values.

Confocal Microscopy
U2OS cells stained with CellTrace
Violet according to the manufacturer’s protocol were seeded
on coverslips with equal number of nonstained U2OS-R1 cells and grown
together to 70% confluence. The cells were then incubated with 1000
ng/mL wild-type FGF2 or FGF2-vcMMAE conjugate labeled with DyLight
550 in the presence of 10 U/mL heparin at 37 °C for 15 min. Then,
the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min
at RT, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C,
and blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 10% normal goat serum, 0.2%
Tween-20, and 0.3 M glycine in PBS) for 1 h at RT. Next, the cells
were incubated with primary rabbit anti-EEA1 antibody overnight at
4 °C and then with an AlexaFluor-488-conjugated goat antirabbit
secondary antibody at RT for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with DAPI, and
the coverslips were mounted with a ProLong Gold antifade mountant.
The cell staining was analyzed using a Cell Observer SD confocal system
(Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an EMCCD QImaging Rolera EM-C2 camera
with a 40× oil immersion objective. Images were processed in
Fiji software.67

Widefield Immunofluorescence
Microscopy
U2OS-R1 cells
grown on coverslips were incubated with 500 ng/mL FGF2 conjugates
or unconjugated wild-type FGF2 in HEPES medium supplemented with 50
U/mL heparin at 37 °C for 40 min and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde
in PBS. The fixed cells were treated with 0.05% saponin for permeabilization
and then stained with primary antibodies; goat anti-FGF2, rabbit anti-FGFR1,
and mouse anti-EEA1; followed by secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat,
-rabbit, and -mouse) coupled to AlexaFluor-488, -568, or -647; and
with Hoechst 33342 to stain DNA. The coverslips were mounted with
the ProLong Gold antifade mountant and viewed under a Deltavision
OMX V4 microscope (GE Healthcare, U.K.) equipped with an Olympus 60×
NA 1.42 Plan Apochromat objective, an InSightSSI widefield illumination
module, and three cooled sCMOS cameras. Four-channel images including
z-stacks covering the whole cell of interest were recorded. Raw data
images were deconvolved and aligned using Softworx software (GE Healthcare,
U.K.). For illustrations, a single optical section was chosen and
images were processed in Fiji software.67
