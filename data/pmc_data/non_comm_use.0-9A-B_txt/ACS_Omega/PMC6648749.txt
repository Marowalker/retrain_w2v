Density functional
theory calculations at IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP computational
level were conducted on palladium-catalyzed regioselective B–H
activation and diarylation of o-carboranes with aryl
iodides in solution. Computational results indicate that this reaction
follows a multistep mechanism and needs to get over several transition
states before the final B(4,5)-diarylated o-carborane
derivatives are formed. B–H activation, oxidation addition,
and successive reduction of the Pd(II) catalyst involving a Pd(II)–Pd(IV)–Pd(II)
catalytic cycle has been confirmed, in which AgOAc plays a crucial
role. Electron-donating group on the cage carbon of o-carboranes is verified to be beneficial for its B–H activation
and diarylation, while steric hindrance between the aryl and o-carboranyl groups retards it. Natural population analysis
and Gibbs free energetic results predict consistent regioselectivities
with experiments and manifest the pivotal role of electronic effect
in controlling regioselective B–H activation of o-carboranes. These results are expected to shed some light on further
improvement of experimental conditions and better controlling of regioselectivities.

==== Body
1 Introduction
o-Carboranes, with two adjacent B–H vertices
in carboranes replaced by C–H units, have potential applications
in many a field such as boron neutron capture therapy and drug development.1−8 Therefore, the functionalization of o-carboranes
has become the focus in carborane area for decades.9−19

Thanks to efforts of many researchers, significant achievements
have been made in the activation of C–H and B–H units
in o-carboranes, including experimental condition
optimization, yield enhancement, and chemo-/regioselectivity improvement.20−29 In 2015, Quan and Xie took Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst and synthesized
a series of B(3)/B(4)-monoarylated o-carboranes through
direct activation of B–H bond, with the aid of phosphine ligand
and Cs2CO3.30 They
found out that the regioselectivity of this reaction was influenced
by the substituents on the cage carbons in o-carborane
substrates. Later, Lyu found that with the aid of AgOAc, Pd(OAc)2 can initiate the reaction of o-carbobane
with aromatic compounds.31 They have prepared
B(4,5)-divinylated o-carborane derivatives with good
regioselectivities through direct activation of B–H bonds in o-carborane. However, because of concurrent existence of
multiple B–H bonds in o-carborane substrate,
regioselective activation and functionalization of B–H bonds
in o-carbobane remains a challenging subject and
has always received widespread attentions.32−35

On the basis of their previous
studies, Quan further achieved regioselective
diarylation of o-carbobanes in toluene solution by
employing Pd(OAc)2 catalyst, in the presence of AgOAc,
HOAc, and aryl iodides (Scheme 1).36 This work represented a novel
method for preparing B(4,5)-diarylated o-carborane
derivatives by transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling of o-carborane with aromatics through direct B–H activation
and has groundbreaking significance for the regioselective activation
and functionalization of B–H bonds in o-carboranes.
Additionally, when R substituent in o-carborane and
Ar group in aryl iodides were different, the isolated yields of B(4,5)-divinylated o-carboranes varied a lot (reactions a, b), a replacement of phenyl by o-methylphenyl
in aryl iodide even led to none products (reaction c).

Scheme 1 Palladium-Catalyzed Diarylation of o-Carboranes
with Aryl Iodides
The authors speculated that the reaction mechanism would
be as
follows: Pd(OAc)2 attacked B(4)/B(5) sites in o-carborane R1 regioselectively, formed the monoarylated
intermediate M3, and diarylated intermediate M6 successively through oxidative addition and reduction elimination.
Finally, intermediate M6 went through deprotonation and
decarboxylation to give the diarylated o-carborane
derivatives P1 (Scheme 1). However, because of the limitation of experimental
methods in detecting active intermediates, the aforementioned mechanism
is still under speculation and lack of deeper theoretical insights.
Available literature has neither elaborated the origin of regioselectivity
of arylation/diarylation nor given out comprehensive explanation about
such an obvious substituent effect of o-carborane
or aryl iodide substrates. Therefore, further computational studies
are urgently needed, for the sake of revealing key factors controlling
the regioselectivity of o-carborane arylation/diarylation
and thus provide possible theoretical guidance for further improvement
of experimental conditions and substrate screening.

In this
paper, density functional B3LYP method and DZVP basis set
were employed to carry out computational studies on palladium-catalyzed
regioselective diarylation of o-carboranes with aryl
iodides, in toluene solution. The mechanism, substituent effect and
regioselectivity of B–H activation, and diarylation of o-carboranes with aryl iodides have been explored and discussed
in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Monoarylation
Mechanism of o-Carborane
For exploration
of the arylation mechanism of o-carborane, calculations
at IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP level were
primarily conducted on the monophenylation of o-carborane
(R1a) with iodobenzene (R2a) in toluene
solution, in the presence of Pd(OAc)2, AgOAc, and HOAc
(reaction a, Scheme 1). Corresponding monophenylation mechanism and geometric
and energetic results are summarized in Scheme 2, Figures 1, and 2, respectively.

Figure 1 Optimized structures
and key geometrical parameters for some stationary
points in the monophenylation process of o-carborane
(R1a) with iodobenzene (R2a) (bond length
in Å). Noncritical atoms especially hydrogens were made transparent
for the sake of clarity.

Figure 2 Relative Gibbs free energies (343 K) and electronic energies (298
K, in parentheses, kcal·mol–1) for monophenylation
of o-carborane (R1a) with iodobenzene
(R2a), obtained at IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP level in toluene
solution. A monomolecular B(4)–H activation pathway through
transition state TS2a′ was plotted in black dotted
line for comparison.

Scheme 2 Monophenylation Mechanism of o-Carborane (R1a) with Iodobenzene (R2a)
As shown in Scheme 2, Pd(OAc)2 attacks B(4)–H
in o-carborane R1a initially via a six-membered
transition
state TS1a and forms a loose complex COM1a; then, COM1a gives off one molecule of HOAc and converts
itself to intermediate INT1a. The free-energy barrier
corresponding to TS1a was calculated to be 24.7 kcal·mol–1 (Figure 2), easy to be overcome at an experimental temperature of 343
K. In intermediate INT1a, Pd atom coordinates with B(4),
OAc– and the carboxyl C=O groups and features
a distorted planar quadrilateral structure. The length of Pd–B(4)
bond in INT1a is calculated to be 2.03 Å (Figure 1), indicating normal
bondage between Pd and B(4) atoms. Thereafter, the H atom in −COOH
group of INT1a undergoes proton transfer via another
six-membered transition state TS2a to form complex COM2a, and a five-membered carboranyl palladacycle INT2a is formed through release of one HOAc molecule. The free-energy
barrier corresponding to TS2a is 17.3 kcal·mol–1, which is 7.4 kcal·mol–1 lower
than that of TS1a (Figure 2). In intermediate INT2a, Pd atom takes
a η2-coordination, with the bond lengths of Pd–B(4)
and Pd–O(10) calculated to be 2.02 and 2.12 Å, respectively.
According to natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, the total Wiberg
bond index (WBI) of Pd(II) atom in INT2a is 1.226 (see
Table S1 in the Supporting Information),
indicating a typical η2-coordination of Pd(II) in
it.

In the presence of iodobenzene (R2a), intermediate INT2a would react with iodobenzene continuingly. The oxidative
addition of Pd(II) is achieved through a three-membered transition
state TS3a, forming a Pd(IV) intermediate INT3a accordingly. In INT3a, the total WBI of Pd atom increased
to 2.482 (Table S1), about twice that of
Pd(II) in INT2a. The free-energy barrier corresponding
to TS3a is 13.6 kcal·mol–1, which
is 11.1 kcal·mol–1 lower than that of TS1a (24.7 kcal·mol–1, Figure 2). The bond lengths of Pd–B(4),
Pd–O(10), Pd–C(14), and Pd–I in INT3a were calculated to be 2.12, 2.16, 2.03, and 2.61 Å, respectively,
with Pd(IV) center in a deformed triangular pyramidal η4-coordination (Figure 1). Next, Pd(IV) atom in INT3a coordinates with
C=O group in AgOAc and forms a new complex COM3a, giving a release of 28.6 kcal·mol–1 free
energies and offering positive driving force for subsequent process
accordingly.

Complex COM3a could be converted to
another complex COM4a via a six-membered transition state TS4a, this process requires to overcome a free-energy barrier
of only
2.5 kcal·mol–1, highly prone to occur at corresponding
experimental temperature (343 K). The resulting complex COM4a can be further transformed to intermediate INT4a after
removal of one molecule of AgI, being endothermic of 18.0 kcal·mol–1 (Figure 2). In INT4a, Pd(IV) atom coordinates with B(4),
O(10), C(14), and O(16) atoms concurrently (with bond lengths among
2.04–2.08 Å, Figure 1), exhibiting a distorted triangular pyramidal η4-coordination. The total WBI of Pd(IV) in INT4a is 2.571, being comparable to that in INT3a (2.482, Table S1). Finally, C(14)–B(4) bond in INT4a is formed through a three-membered transition state TS5a, directing the C–B coupling between phenyl and o-carboranyl groups and forming the B(4)-phenylation intermediate INT5a. The conversion from COM4a to INT5a via INT4a and TS5a requires to overcome
a free-energy barrier of 22.9 kcal·mol–1, about
1.8 kcal·mol–1 lower than that of TS1a (24.7 kcal·mol–1). The total WBI of Pd(II)
in INT5a is reduced to 1.679, comparable to that of Pd(II)
in intermediate INT1a (1.692, Table S1).

It’s notable that another pathway leading
to complex COM2a, through a monomolecular B(4)-H activation
transition
state TS2a′, had also been located (Figures 2 and S1). In this monomolecular
pathway, Pd(OAc)2 interacts with −COOH group firstly
to form complex COM1a′ and intermediate INT1a′ successively, removes one molecule of HOAc and
then activates the B(4)–H bond through transition state TS2a′ (Figure S1). The relative
free energy of TS2a′ (23.0 kcal·mol–1) is slightly lower than that of TS1a (24.7 kcal·mol–1, Figure 2). If steady-state approximation37 dominates in such a process, the calculated free-energy barrier
for TS2a′ is 23.0 kcal·mol–1. However, if equilibrium approximation37 holds, the corresponding free-energy barrier is as high as 31.9
kcal·mol–1 at 343 K, about 7.2 kcal·mol–1 higher than that of TS1a. The obviously
higher free-energy barrier of TS2a′ than TS1a will significantly slow down the reaction rate getting
over TS2a′. Anyway, these two pathways lead to
the same complex COM2a.

2.2 Diarylation
Mechanism of o-Carborane
In the presence
of sufficient amounts of iodobenzene
and AgOAc, the previously formed intermediate INT5a can
further undergo B(5)-phenylation to form a diphenylated o-carborane derivative INT9a. The diphenylation mechanism
of B(5)–H in INT5a is analogous to the monophenylation
of B(4)–H in R1a, with corresponding results shown
in Scheme 3, Figures 3, and 4 accordingly.

Figure 3 Optimized structures and key geometrical parameters for
some stationary
points in the diphenylation process of intermediate INT5a (bond length in Å). Noncritical atoms especially hydrogens
were made transparent for the sake of clarity.

Figure 4 Relative Gibbs free energies (343 K) and electronic energies (298
K, in parentheses, kcal·mol–1) for diphenylation
of intermediate INT5a, obtained at IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP
level in toluene solution.

Scheme 3 Diphenylation Mechanism of Intermediate INT5a
Similar to the activation of
B(4)–H in R1a,
the B(5)–H bond in INT5a can be activated via
a six-membered transition state TS6a, but with a lower
free-energy barrier (24.3 kcal·mol–1, Figure 4) compared with that
of TS1a (24.7 kcal·mol–1). This
indicates the phenylation of the second B–H bond is slightly
easier than the phenylation of the first B–H bond. Then, the
forming complex COM5a removes one molecule of HOAc and
converts itself to a Pd(II) intermediate INT6a (Scheme 3). In INT6a, the bond lengths of Pd–B(5) and Pd–O(10) are 2.02
and 2.13 Å, respectively (Figure 3), and the total WBI of Pd(II) is 1.226, identical
with that of Pd(II) in INT2a (Table S1). Thereafter, intermediate INT6a would react
with a second molecule of iodobenzene (R2a) and being
converted to the Pd(IV) intermediate INT7a via a three-membered
transition state TS7a, with a free-energy barrier of
16.3 kcal·mol–1 (Figure 4), about 8.4 kcal·mol–1 lower than that of TS1a (24.7 kcal·mol–1, Figure 2). In the
new formed intermediate INT7a, the bond lengths of Pd–B(5),
Pd–O(10), Pd–C(20), and Pd–I are 2.12, 2.18,
2.04, and 2.61 Å, respectively, with Pd(IV) center placed in
a η4-coordinated triangular pyramidal configuration.
The total WBI of Pd(IV) in INT7a becomes 2.486, much
larger than that of Pd(II) in INT6a (1.226, Table S1).

With AgOAc added, intermediate INT7a would continue
to react with AgOAc and transform to complex COM6a spontaneously,
being exothermic of 27.6 kcal·mol–1. The conversion
of complex COM6a to complex COM7a through
transition state TS8a needs to overcome a free-energy
barrier of 4.2 kcal·mol–1 (Figure 4), that is very easy to be
achieved at an experimental temperature of 343 K. Similar to COM4a, complex COM7a can be transferred to intermediate INT8a via removal of one molecule of AgI, featuring an energy
absorption of 19.3 kcal·mol–1 (Figure 4). In INT8a, Pd(IV)
coordinates with B(5), O(10), C(20), and O(21) concurrently, with
corresponding bond lengths being 2.09, 2.07, 2.04, and 2.06 Å,
respectively (Figure 3). The Pd(IV) center in INT8a is located in an η4-coordinated triangular pyramidal configuration, with the
total WBI of Pd(IV) in it calculated to be 2.593, comparable to that
of Pd(IV) in intermediate INT7a (2.486, Table S1). After the formation of INT8a, C(20)
and B(5) couples through a three-membered transition state TS9a, getting over a free-energy barrier of 27.2 kcal·mol–1 (Figure 4) and being
transformed into the B(4,5)-diphenylated intermediate INT9a. In INT9a, the total WBI of Pd(II) is reduced to 1.686,
much smaller than that of Pd(IV) in INT8a (2.593, Table S1).

Finally, INT9a would
undergo decarboxylation and protonolysis
process by the aid of HOAc in a stepwise way and directs the formation
of diphenylated o-carborane derivative P1a. Many possibilities had been taken into consideration (Scheme S1 and Figure S2), with the most probable one presented in Figure 5. Under the help of AgI fragment, the decarboxylation
of INT9a only needs to get over a free-energy barrier
of 30.7 kcal·mol–1 (TS10a_II),
about 11.1 kcal·mol–1 lower than its counterpart
in the AgI-absence case (TS10a_I, Scheme S1 and Figure S2). The free-energy
barrier corresponding to subsequent protonolysis of INT10a_I with HOAc through TS11a_II is even lower; it’s
calculated to be not higher than 24.1 kcal·mol–1, about 6.6 kcal·mol–1 lower than aforementioned
decarboxylation barrier (TS10a_II, 30.7 kcal·mol–1). Because a large amount of heat had been released
and accumulated during the formation of intermediate INT9a, the generation of product P1a through Path II, as shown in Figure 5, would be smooth. The optimal decarboxylation mechanism predicted
here coincides well with literature reports about similar transition-metal
catalyzed decarboxylation processes.38−46

Figure 5 Most
probable mechanism and relative Gibbs free energies (In kcal·mol–1) for the decarboxylation and protonolysis of INT9a, obtained at IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP level in toluene solution.

According to Schemes 2 and 3, in the presence of iodobenzene (R2a), Pd(OAc)2, AgOAc, and HOAc, o-carborane (R1a) needs to get through multiple transition
states (TS1a–TS9a), intermediates (INT1a–INT8a), and complexes (COM1a–COM7a) before it’s
transferred to the B(4,5)-diphenylated o-carborane
intermediate INT9a. The whole process experienced two
oxidation/reduction cycles of Pd(II)–Pd(IV)–Pd(II) (corresponding
to INT2a → INT3a →→ INT5a and INT6a → INT7a →→ INT9a respectively), among which AgOAc has played an important
role in the regeneration of Pd(II) catalyst. Our computational results
have confirmed previous literature speculation on the diarylation
mechanism of o-carborane R1a(36) successfully. The circular variation of WBI
values for palladium in different stationary points also evidenced
the valence change of palladium well, as deemed by previous experiments29,35,47−50 and theoretical calculations51,52 in similar reactions. Apart from a very few structures, most of
the free-energy barriers corresponding to transition states (TSs) involved in the first B–H
[B(4)–H]’s activation process (TS1a–TS5a) are higher than that involved in the second B–H [B(5)–H]’s
activation process (TS6a–TS9a). This indicates
that the activation of the second B–H in R1a is
easier than the activation of the first one, in line with corresponding
experimental outcomes that the reaction produces mainly diphenylated o-carboranes rather than monophenylated ones.36

Considering the free-energy barrier corresponding
to TS1a is as high as 24.7 kcal·mol–1, and TS1a itself locates much higher than the reactants
(while
most other TSs locate lower than them), we speculate that the activation
of the first B–H bond (TS1a) is crucial and has
critical impact on the whole mono- and di-arylation process of o-carborane R1a. In addition, the free-energy
barrier of transition state TS9a, which is involved in
the diphenylation process, was calculated to be as high as 27.2 kcal·mol–1 also has a pivotal influence on the whole reaction
rate. A half-life of 5.8 h, transferred from TS9a’s
free-energy barrier at 343 K (Table S2),
is in good agreement with 73% isolated yield of o-carborane derivative (P1a) after being reacted for
12 h.36

2.3 Regioselectivities
of o-Carborane’s
Arylation/Diarylation
According to the literature,36 the reaction of o-carborane
(R1a) with iodobenzene (R2a) has good regioselectivity
and mainly yields B(4,5)-diarylation product P1a. To
investigate the regioselective origin of B–H activation in o-carborane, we continued to calculate the natural population
analysis (NPA) charge population of R1a, Pd(OAc)2 and INT5a, with corresponding results listed
in Table 1.

Table 1 NPA Charge Population of R1a, Pd(OAc)2 and INT5a
Because of the directing effect of −COOH group,
the spatially
allowed B–H activation sites in R1a should be
B(3)–H, B(4)–H, B(5)–H, and B(6)–H, while
the geometry-permitted diarylation sites in INT5a could
be B(3)–H, B(5)–H, and B(6)–H. According to NPA
charge population results (Table 1), there is partial positive charge distribution of
+0.051 on B(4)–H in R1a, which is significantly
more than that distributed on B(3)–H, B(5)–H, and B(6)–H
(+0.030 to +0.042). At the same time, the oxygen atom in Pd(OAc)2 shows partial negative charge distribution ranging from −0.652
to −0.656. This indicates that B(4)–H in substrate R1a can combine more easily with OAc– in
Pd(OAc)2 to achieve B(4)–H’s activation.
Similarly, in intermediate INT5a, there is partial positive
charge distribution of +0.048 on B(5)–H, which is also obviously
more than that distributed on B(3)–H and B(6)–H (+0.031
to +0.035). Meanwhile, the oxygen atoms in the OAc– group are distributed with partial negative charge ranging from
−0.638 to −0.640. Thus, B(5)–H in INT5a is more attractive to OAc– and finally directs
B(4,5)-diarylation through proton migration and removal of one molecule
of HOAc. The regioselective product [B(4,5)-diarylated o-carbobane] predicted by NPA charge population is completely consistent
with experimental major product.36

To prove the reliability of aforementioned NPA charge predictions,
we have further optimized and located the TSs corresponding to B(3)–,
B(5)– and B(6)–H activation in reactant R1a. The results are shown in Figure 6a, with TS1a rearranged for comparison.
The free-energy barriers of transition states TS1a_3, TS1a, TS1a_5, and TS1a_6, which
correspond to B(3)–, B(4)–, B(5)–, and B(6)–H
activation, respectively, are 31.5, 24.7, 25.8, and 28.2 kcal·mol–1, respectively. Lower free-energy barrier of TS1a (24.7 vs 31.5, 25.8, and 28.2 kcal·mol–1) indicates the B(4)–H activation in o-carborane R1a is most feasible, followed by B(5)–H; while B(3)–H
and B(6)–H activation is more difficult. It’s inspiring
the energy barrier results of B(3)–H, B(4)–H, B(5)–H,
and B(6)–H activation (Figure 6a) give out consistent prediction with NPA charge population
in B–H activation regioselectivity of o-carborane R1a and provide a good explanation for literature assumption
that B(4)–H activation is prior to B(5)–H activation.29,36

Figure 6 (a)
Relative Gibbs free energies (In kcal·mol–1) for regioselective activation of B(3)–H to B(6)–H
in R1a and (b) for regioselective activation of B(3)–H,
B(5)–H and B(6)–H in INT5a, both obtained
at IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP level in toluene solution.

Similarly, in the monophenylated intermediate INT5a, spatially possible B–H activation, and diphenylation sites
are B(3)–, B(5)–, and B(6)–H (Figure 6b). The calculated free-energy
barriers of TSs corresponding to B(3)–, B(5)–, and B(6)–H
activation (TS6a_3, TS6a and TS6a_6 accordingly) are 26.7, 24.3, and 28.3 kcal·mol–1, respectively, indicating B(5)–H activation in INT5a is the easiest, whereas B(3)–H and B(6)–H activation
are much less competitive. Again, the energy barrier results of B(3)–H,
B(5)–H, and B(6)–H activation (Figure 6b) predict consistent priority of B–H
activation with NPA charge population in INT5a, and same
regioselective products with experiments.36 As the NPA charge population on different B–Hs in substrate R1a and intermediate INT5a correlates negatively
with corresponding TS barriers of these B–Hs’ activation
(Figure 7), it’s
deemed the regioselectivity of B–H activation and arylation/diarylation
in o-carborane R1a is mainly affected
by the electronic effect.

B–H activation
in R1a (a)/INT5a (b) and NPA charge population on corresponding H atoms.

2.4 Substituent Effect of Substrates
To further investigate the effect of substituents on cage carbon
in o-carborane and in aryl iodide, we went on to
conduct calculations on reaction of o-carborane R1b with iodobenzene (R2a) (reaction b, Scheme 1), as well
as reaction of o-carbobane R1a with o-methyl-iodobenzene (R2c) (reaction c), with corresponding mechanism depicted in Scheme S2 and free-energy results plotted in Figure S3, respectively.

It can be deduced from Scheme S2 that the diarylation mechanism of o-carborane in reactions b and c are similar with reaction a, which means the substituents
on cage carbon in o-carborane and aryl group in aryl
iodide append little influence on this reaction’s mechanism.
The B(4)–H activation of R1b features a free-energy
barrier of 26.4 kcal·mol–1 (TS1b, Figure S3) and plays a rate-determining
step role in reaction b. Except for a very few structures,
the relative Gibbs free energies of most stationary points in reaction b are located slightly higher than that of reaction a, suggesting that the electron-donating group (Me) on cage
carbon in o-carborane is more beneficial than H substitution
for B–H activation. These results also provide good explanation
for Quan’s preference of alkyl substituted o-carboranes as substrates in their experiments.36 The NPA charge population of R1b shows less
positive charge distribution (+0.048, Figure 8) on B(4)–H in it when comparing with R1a (+0.051) and rationalizes a slightly higher free-energy
barrier of TS1b (26.4 kcal·mol–1) than TS1a (24.7 kcal·mol–1).
The rate for reaction b to step across TS1b was calculated to be about 13 times slower than that of reaction a (Table S2); namely, the formation
rate of P1b is slower than that of P1a and
thus leads to lower yield of P1b than P1a under identical reaction time (12 h) and conditions.

Figure 8 Optimized geometries
of R1a, R1b, TS1a, and TS1b, with free-energy barriers (In
kcal·mol–1) of TS1a and TS1b depicted for comparison.

When keeping o-carborane R1a unchanged
and replacing iodobenzene (R2a) with o-methyl-iodobenzene (R2c), the relative Gibbs free energies
of stationary points in reaction c in the first part
(before INT2c, Figure S3)
are identical with reaction a. However, once the arylation
of o-carborane begins (after COM3c),
all stationary points in reaction c become less stable
than that in reaction a or b. The instability
of stationary points in reaction c in the diarylation
process (after INT5c) becomes much more significant.
On the basis of comprehensive comparison between optimized structures
of stationary points located on the potential energy surfaces of reactions a and c, the relative instability of stationary
points in reaction c is attributed to increasing steric
hindrance between o-methylphenyl and o-carboranyl groups in these structures. Take the rate-determining TS9c for example, the nearest distance between o-methylphenyl and o-carboranyl groups in it [H(b)···H(c), Figure 9] is only 2.07 Å,
about 14% shorter than its counterpart in TS9a. A similar
phenomenon can also be observed between other parts of these two groups
[for instance, H(a)···H(b) and H(d)···H(e)].
All of this suggests a more compact structure of TS9c than TS9a, and extra steric hindrance arising between o-methylphenyl and o-carboranyl groups
in reaction c.

Figure 9 Part of the potential energy surfaces (energy
in kcal·mol–1) of reactions a and c,
with optimized structures of TS9a and TS9c depicted (bond length in Å).

A free-energy barrier as high as 29.6 kcal·mol–1 corresponding to TS9c represents the retarding effect
of this arising steric hindrance on the diarylation process of reaction c energetically (Figure 9); it prevents the formation of diarylated intermediate INT9c and rationalizes the experimental disappearance of P1c at 343 K (Scheme 1). When different substrates were taken into consideration,
our computational results are in good agreement with corresponding
experimental yields and trend, and in turn verified the credibility
of IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP results in this reaction system.

3 Conclusions
We have employed density functional theory
method at B3LYP level
to conduct computational studies on palladium-catalyzed diarylation
of o-carboranes with aryl iodides. On the basis of
IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP outcomes obtained in toluene solution at 343 K,
the following conclusions can be drawn:(1) The Pd(II)-catalyzed
diarylation of o-carboranes with aryl iodides is
a multistep process, and
several TSs and intermediates were involved in the formation of B(4,5)-diarylated o-carbobane derivatives. An oxidation/reduction cycle of
Pd(II)–Pd(IV)–Pd(II) was identified, in which AgOAc
has played an important role.

(2) Electron-donating group on the cage
carbon in o-carborane is beneficial for its B–H
activation and diarylation, whereas steric hindrance between the aryl
and o-carboranyl groups retards it. Huge steric hindrance
arisen from o-methylphenyl and o-carboranyl groups can even block the formation of corresponding
diarylated o-carbobane derivatives.

(3) The preference of arylation/diarylation
at B(4)/B(5) sites in o-carbobanes was identified
by more positive NPA charge distribution on B(4)/B(5)–Hs in
it. Further mechanism and energy calculations verify the regioselectivity
results predicted by NBO theory well and hint the regioselectivity
of B–H activation here is strikingly affected by electronic
effect.



Our work has not only reproduced
corresponding experimental yields
and trend successfully but also rationalized the regioselective formation
of B(4,5)-diarylation o-carborane derivatives well.
This would be beneficial for future improvement of experimental conditions
and better controlling of regioselectivities.

4 Computational
Details
On the basis of comprehensive tests of the influence
of method
and basis set on such Ni-mediated cycloaddition between carboryne
and unsaturated compounds53,54 and the fact that density
functional B3LYP method keeps giving out reasonable predictions in
other similar reactions,26,55−58 all calculations involved in this paper were performed by using
B3LYP method59,60 as implemented in the Gaussian
09 Program,61 combined with the double-ζ
valence polarized basis set (DZVP).62,63 All stationary
points were confirmed by vibrational analysis based on geometry-optimized
structures of same computational level, that is, all minima with no
imaginary frequency and all TSs have a single imaginary frequency
which corresponds to correct vibrational mode. Key TSs were further
checked by intrinsic reaction coordinate method,64−66 to ensure that
the TSs found reside properly on their potential energy surfaces and
connect right reactants, products or intermediates.

For better
simulation of aimed reaction in toluene solvent, solvent
effect of toluene (ε = 2.37, at 343 K) was taken into consideration
by using the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) polarizable continuum
model,67 employing our previously established
IDSCRF radii,68 denoted IDSCRF-B3LYP. Single-point
calculations on reaction a at IDSCRF-B3LYP-D3//IDSCRF-B3LYP/DZVP
level (denoted B3LYP-D3) were also performed, to see if dispersion
correction was necessary. As shown in Figure S4, the B3LYP-D3 method69,70 gave out a relatively lower but
similar potential energy surfaces (PESs) with B3LYP method. Except
for a few low-lying complexes such as COM3a, COM4a, COM6a, and COM7a, the PESs based on B3LYP-D3
single-point calculations is similar to its B3LYP counterparts and
brings no significant impact on the rate-determining step or the whole
reaction process. Therefore, only B3LYP results were discussed in
the manuscript. All free energies were calculated from standard determinations
emerging from the Gaussian 09 program output, and solution-phase translational
entropy contributions to free energy were considered by employing
Thermo program.71

To see the trends
and differences between electronic and Gibbs
free energies more clearly, Figure S5 was
derived from data presented in Table S5. The trends of ΔE (298 K) and ΔG (343 K) for reaction a are generally consistent.
Moreover, the relative free-energy barriers obtained at 298 K [ΔG (298 K)] are relatively higher when comparing with corresponding
experimental data. Therefore, unless specified elsewhere, all energy
results discussed in the manuscript were relative Gibbs free energies
corrected at experimental temperature (343 K). However, for convenience
in comparison, electronic energies of reaction a at 298
K [ΔE (298 K)] were also labeled (in parentheses)
in Figures 2 and 4.

In addition, NBO72−74 analysis, as
implemented in Gaussian 09 program,
was also performed on selected stationary points to investigate their
atomic charge population and WBI properties.
