Two
dyes TB and TSB containing triphenylamine
as the donor and perylenemonoimide as the acceptor, with and without
bithiophene as π-bridge, respectively, were successfully prepared
and characterized for p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSSCs)
and dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PECs). As a result, TSB with bithiophene π-bridge exhibited a broader absorption
spectrum and a higher molar extinction coefficient than TB. Furthermore, the photocurrents of p-DSSCs and DS-PECs for the dye TSB were increased by 26.9 and 32.9%, respectively, compared
with those of the dye TB. Meanwhile, the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy of the TSB-based p-DSSC showed
the smaller charge-transfer resistance and larger hole lifetime because
the longer π-bridge facilitated charge transfer and separation
within the dye molecule and effectively prevented the hole recombination
process at the NiO/dye interface, resulting in improvement of photoelectric
performance. Hence, these results show that the π-bridge extension
of dyes has a promising effect on the photocurrent improvement of
p-DSSCs and DS-PECs.

1 Introduction
Severe challenges in balancing
the energy utilization, economic
development, and environmental protection have impelled scientists
and technicians continuously to investigate solar power and sustainable
and clean energy.1−5 Fortunately, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)6−14 and dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PECs) have emerged,15−19 as a means of converting solar energy20−23 into green fuels and electrical
energy, respectively,24,25 which really leads a comprehensive
viable approach to use highly efficient solar energy. Enhancing light-harvesting
ability by broadening the absorption spectrum of dyes is the effective
way to improve the photoelectric conversion performance. In general,
the tandem p-/n-type device can achieve it by the two dyes whose spectral
responses are complementary to each other adsorbed on the photoanode
and the photocathode, respectively, which can avoid competitive adsorption
between dyes adsorbed on the same semiconductor substrate. It is worth
mentioning that the theoretical efficiency of a single photoelectrode
device is around 30% for DSSCs, whereas the theoretical conversion
efficiency of the tandem p-/n-type device reaches 43%. The greatest
advantage is that the absorption spectrum can be broadened by two
dyes whose spectral responses are complementary to each other.

As He et al. first reported a NiO-based p-type dye-sensitized photocathode
and constructed a tandem p-/n-DSSC,26,27 research on
tandem p-/n-DSSCs has gradually made progress in the past 20 years.12,17,28 However, the overall power conversion
efficiency of tandem p-/n-DSSCs is much lower than that of n-DSSCs.29−31 The reason is mainly attributed to the lower photocurrent rooted
in the p-type electrode, causing the mismatch photocurrent generated
by the counterpart n-type electrode. As an antenna for capturing light
energy, the spectral absorption range and molar extinction coefficient
of a dye sensitizer have the most important influence on the photocurrent.32−36 Currently, perylenemonoimide (PMI)-6T-TPA is the most efficient
dye applied in p-DSSCs and p-DS-PEC devices.28,37 Among them, 3-hexyl-substituted sexithiophene groups as π-bridge
are a bright spot of the dye structure, which not only broadens the
spectral absorption but also increases the distance between the holes
and the electrons in the NiO and dye, reducing the recombination between
electrons and holes, resulting in further improved photoelectric performance.
In previous report, compounds YK-1 and YK-2 were constructed by our group, and the effects of anchoring groups
on p-DSSCs and DS-PECs were discussed.38 In addition, triphenylamine is widely used in photovoltaic materials
because of its easy generation of holes and high hole mobility.39−41 Therefore, our group synthesized two new dyes TB and TSB based on the dye YK-1 with triphenylamine
as the donor and the bithiophene group as the π-bridge for further
improving the photoelectric performance of the device.

Hence,
we studied the influence of π-bridge on dye absorption
and photovoltaic and photoelectric properties for the two dyes TB and TSB. Because of the introduction of bithiophene,
the absorption spectrum of the dye was red-shifted by 5 nm, and the
molar absorption coefficient was increased to 40 100 ε/M–1 cm–1 for TSB. The
photocurrents of p-DSSCs and DS-PECs for the dye TSB were
increased by 26.9 and 32.9%, respectively, compared with those of
the dye TB. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
was employed to further investigate the influence of extending π-bridge
on the charge-transfer and recombination processes in the p-DSSCs.
The linear scan voltammetry (LSV) and the transient photocurrent responses
were also employed to estimate the photovoltaic performances of the
dye-sensitized photocathodes. A schematic view of the molecular structure
of two dyes TB and TSB and Co-1 is shown in Scheme 1.

2.2 Characterization Method
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were acquired
at 400 and 100
MHz, respectively, with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard.
The high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) measurements were obtained
with a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer.

The UV–visible
(vis) absorption spectra of the dyes in solution and absorbed on NiO
films were obtained by a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. The cyclic
voltammograms (CVs) were determined by using a CHI660C electrochemical
workstation with a three-electrode cell (dye-sensitized NiO as the
working electrode (WE), Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt
as the counter electrode). The electrolyte consisted of a tetrahydrofuran
(THF) solution of 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate
(TBAPF6) with ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+)
redox couple employed as an internal potential reference. The scan
rate was 100 mV s–1. Photovoltaic measurements were
carried out under an AM 1.5 solar simulator employed as the light
source equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp.

incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
(IPCE) were obtained with a Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). J–V curves were acquired by a Keithley
model 2400 digital source meter. EIS was obtained by a Zahner IM6e

2.4 Preparation of NiO Films
A precursor
solution of copolymer F68 (2 g), deionized water (H2O,
6 g), nickel(I)chloride (NiCl2, 2 g), and ethanol (EtOH,
12 g) was obtained according to the previous report.43 The NiO film was formed on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)
glass by a spin-coating method at 500 rpm for 9 s and then 2000 rpm
for 30 s. The film was obtained after heating in an oven at 450 °C
for 30 min. For p-DSSC, the four-layer NiO film with a thickness of
2 μm for each layer was acquired after four repetitions of spin-coating
and heating procedure. The three layers for DS-PEC were obtained by
the same method.

2.5 Fabrication of the DSSCs
The prepared
NiO films were immersed in 3 × 10–4 M dye solution
in a mixture of MeOH/toluene (v/v = 7/3) at room temperature for 12
h. The Pt-counter electrodes were obtained by heating at 400 °C
for 15 min after spin-coating 20 mM H2PtCl6 isopropanol
solution onto the FTO glass. The dye-sensitized NiO WE was acquired
after washing with EtOH and was then assembled with the Pt-counter
electrode together employing a 25 μm thick Surlyn gasket. The
electrolyte consisted of 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN, 0.6 M
BMII, and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile (GuSCN = guanidine thiocyanate,
BMII = 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and TBP = tert-butylpyridine).

2.6 Fabrication of the Photoelectrochemical
Cells
An Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt counter electrode,
and the
dye-sensitized NiO WE were employed to prepare a traditional three-electrode
system according to the above method. A catalyst was introduced onto
dye-sensitized NiO films by drop-casting the acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution of Co-1 (100 μL, 2 mM) onto
the surface of NiO and then drying with air flow. The electrolyte
was an aqueous solution of 10 mM phosphate at pH = 7. All DS-PEC cells
were deoxygenated by N2 for at least 15 min before the
measurements.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Dye Synthesis
In this work, the main
point of the molecular structure design was the addition of the π-bridge.
Hence, TB and TSB were both synthesized
with modified triphenylamine and PMI as the electron donor and the
electron acceptor part for building a large conjugate unit, respectively.
Dithiophene π-bridge was introduced into TSB to
increase the distance between the donor and the acceptor, reduce the
charge recombination, and enhance the light-capturing ability.13,14 Two dyes were synthesized through a series of chemical reactions
of bromination, carboxyester hydrolysis, Suzuki coupling, and Williamson
ether synthesis, and the synthetic route is shown in Scheme 2. First, compound 2 was obtained by the Suzuki coupling reaction of 1 and
4-((ethoxycarbonyl)phenyl)boronic acid and then by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and coupling to provide the key
intermediate 3. In addition, another important intermediate 6 was obtained by alkylation reaction, Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling, and regioselective bromination of 4.
Then Suzuki coupling reactions were performed between 3 and 4 and 3 and 6 to connect
the donor and acceptor, respectively. The target products TB and TSB were obtained by the carboxyester hydrolysis
of 7 and 8, respectively. All the new compounds
were confirmed with 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS.

3.2 Optical and Electrochemical Properties
Figure 1 shows the
UV–vis absorption spectra of TB and TSB dissolved in THF and adsorbed on NiO films, respectively, and their
corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. With the push–pull structure, both
dyes in the THF solution exhibited major absorption bands in wavelength
ranges of 500–550 nm in Figure 1a. Meanwhile, the π-bridge between triphenylamine
donor and PMI accepter leads to a difference in the light absorption
capacity of two dyes. As a result, the maximum absorption peaks attributed
to the intramolecular charge transfer are located at λmax = 528 and 534 nm for TB and TSB, respectively,
indicating that the π-bridge was beneficial for broadening the
absorption spectra. Meanwhile, the π-bridge also has a great
influence on the molar extinction coefficient, in which the dye TSB with dithiophene π-bridge has a higher molar extinction
coefficient (40 100 ε/M–1 cm–1) than TB (27 900 ε/M–1 cm–1). In addition, compared to TB, the maximum absorption peak of YK-1 is located at
λmax = 547 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient
(34 600 ε/M–1 cm–1) because of strong electron-donating ability of diphenylamine donor.
Compared with the absorption spectra in solution, the maximum absorption
peaks of TB showed a blue shift by 6 nm on the NiO film,
whereas in TSB, it barely shifted (Figure 1b). When sensitizers adsorbed onto the NiO
surface, the carboxyl group of dyes undergoes a deprotonation reaction,
and its electron-withdrawing ability is greatly reduced. As the intramolecular
electron push–pull effect is weakened, the charge polarization
energy increases, so the absorption of TB exhibits a
sharp blue shift. As for TSB, the intramolecular electron
push–pull effect has not weakened because of the introduction
of the π-bridge, so the absorption spectrum of TSB is basically not blue-shifted.44,45

energy (E0–0) was calculated from

d All potentials are given versus

e The excited-state potentials were
estimated from E0–0 and the recorded
potentials by using CV, according to the following:

Unlike conventional optoelectronic
devices, light absorption and
charge transfer are separated in dye-sensitized photocathodes. The
dye acts as a photosensitizer that can capture photons from the sunlight
and stimulate to an excited state (dye*) through photoexcitation.
The holes transfer from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
of dye* to the valence band (VB) of NiO to form the charge-separated
state dye–/NiO (h+), and then the holes
(h+) divert to glass coated with FTO through NiO. The reduced
dye is regenerated by transferring electrons to redox couples (usually
I3–/I–) or hydrogen-producing
catalyst (typically used with Co-1(42)) in p-DSSCs and p-DS-PECs, respectively. In order to investigate
the feasibility of charge-transfer process, CVs of reduction dyes TB and TSB were tested in DCM solution (Figure 2b), and the corresponding
data are listed in Table 1. First, the potentials Es*/s– (corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of TB and TSB) were located at 1.32 and 1.22 V versus NHE,
respectively, and were much lower than the VB of NiO (0.54 V vs NHE).
It guaranteed sufficient driving force for hole metastasis from the
dye to NiO. In addition, the zero–zero transition energy E0–0 values (corresponding to band gap),
estimated from the absorption threshold from the absorption spectra
of dyes in solution, were 2.09 eV for TB and 2.02 eV
for TSB (Table 1), respectively. The potential Es/s– values (corresponding to the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital energy levels of TB and TSB) were −0.77 and −0.80 V versus NHE for TB and TSB, respectively (Table 1). These values were much higher than the
redox potential of the iodide/triiodide system (∼0.40 V vs
NHE) in DSSCs and cocatalyst Co-1 (∼0.43 V vs
NHE) in DS-PECs, indicating sufficient thermodynamic force for electron
transfer between the excited dyes and the redox couple, cocatalyst.
The schematic diagram of energy levels and charge divert processes
in p-DSSCs and p-DS-PECs is shown in Figure 2c. In addition, from the CV of TB and TSB for 20 cycles (Figure 2a), we can easily infer that both dyes have
excellent photoelectrochemical stability.

3.3 Photovoltaic
Properties
The performances
of p-DSSCs based on the two dyes (TB and TSB) were obtained under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm–2). Figure 3a shows
the photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of the p-DSSCs, and the corresponding
data are listed in Table 1. It was found that the device based on TSB with
dithiophene π-bridge showed higher Jsc compared to TB. Generally speaking, the Jsc value is related to the light-capturing ability of
photosensitizers. Jsc of p-DSSCs based
on TSB with the larger molar extinction coefficient is
higher than that of TB. In addition, the higher IPCE
values of the TSB-based p-DSSCs in the visible light
range of 350–650 nm (Figure 3b) also support this result. It is worth noting that
the IPCE values of TB- and TSB-based p-DSSCs
were also much higher than those of YK-1 and YK-2 in our previous report.38 Although it
has better light-trapping ability than TB, YK-1 has an energy level similar to TSB and the cell performance
of the YK-1-based device is lower than those of TB- and TSB-based devices. This is because the
hole mobility of triphenylamine donor in p-DSSCs is higher than that
of diphenylamine.39−41

and (b)
IPCE spectra for p-DSSCs prepared by a screen-printing method based

electrolyte.

3.4 Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
In general, Voc is correlated to the
hole recombination rate and the VB (EVB) position at the electrolyte/dye/NiO interface. Here, EIS was employed
to understand the difference of Voc between TB- and TSB-based p-DSSCs. The charge-transfer
resistances (Rct), chemical capacitances
(Cchem), and the hole lifetimes (τh) of the p-DSSCs based on TB and TSB were investigated (Figure 4). Figure 4a shows the charge-transfer resistance (Rrec) between the NiO films and the electrolyte, where the Rrec of p-DSSCs based on TSB was larger than
that based on TB under the voltage range, indicating
that the introduction of dithiophene π-bridge efficiently inhibited
charge recombination at the NiO/dye/electrolyte interface.

resistance (Rct); (b) chemical capacitance
(Cchem);
and (c) hole lifetime (τh) of p-DSSCs based on the
device of TB and TSB plotted against potentials
via electrochemical impedance measurements in the dark.

In addition, Voc is
positively correlated
to the quasi-Fermi level (EFn) of NiO.
An increase in Voc was observed under
the conditions of the TSB-based device compared to TB, and the result is further confirmed by the hole lifetime
(τh) and chemical capacitance (Cchem). The Cchem for TSB-based p-DSSCs was lower than that for TB-based
p-DSSCs in Figure 4b, indicating the lower NiO VB energy and hole state density, thereby
leading to an improved Voc. The τh was used to evaluate the hole recombination between the injected
holes in the NiO film and the sensitizer or redox couple. The values
of the TSB-based p-DSSCs were higher than that of TB-based p-DSSCs as shown in Figure 4c, further indicating that the extended dithiophene
π-bridge effectively inhibited hole recombination, resulting
in an improved Voc and a higher PCE.

3.5 Photoelectrochemical Properties of Dye-Sensitized
NiO Films
In order to study the photocatalytic performance
of the dye-sensitized photocathode, we constructed DS-PEC based on TB and TSB, respectively. After illumination
of the photocathode, the excited dyes acted as photosensitizers to
inject holes into the VB of NiO, and then the molecular catalyst Co-1 was reduced by the dye for eventual hydrogen and photocurrent
generation. The schematic diagram of charge divert processes in p-DS-PECs
is shown in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Schematic Diagram of Energy Levels and Charge-Transfer Processes
in p-DS-PECs
Here, we investigated
the photoelectrochemical performance of dye-sensitized
NiO membranes. In a traditional three-electrode cell system, the dye-sensitized
NiO photocathode was used as the WE and Pt plate and Ag/AgCl were
used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively.
LSV and transient photocurrent responses (I–t) were employed to study the interfacial electron-transfer
kinetics.

As shown in Figure 5, LSV of TB + Co-1@NiO and TSB + Co-1@NiO showed the relationship between
the applied
bias potential and the photocurrent, respectively. Under illumination,
the photocurrent of TB + Co-1@NiO obviously
increased from −0.25 to −0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and then
at E > −0.1 V (Figure 5a), it reached a plateau with a photocurrent
density of 50 μA cm–2.17 Meanwhile, TSB + Co-1@NiO showed
similar trends, whose photocurrent rapidly increased with the applied
bias from −0.25 to −0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and then reached
a plateau at E > −0.1 V with a photocurrent
density of 75 μA cm–2 (Figure 5b). These values are higher compared to the
current densities under dark conditions, revealing that the dye-sensitized
photocathode is photoactive. It is worth noting that the photocurrent
of TSB + Co-1@NiO is higher than that of TB + Co-1@NiO, which may be attributed to the
broader absorption and higher molar extinction coefficient of TSB because of the introduction of dithiophene π-bridge.

Figure 5 LSV measurements
of the (a) TB + Co-1@NiO and (b) TSB + Co-1@NiO WEs under 100
mW cm–2 light illumination (scan rate = 50 mV s–1), operated in a three-electrode PEC cell with Ag/AgCl
as the reference electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and 100 mM
PBS (pH = 7.0) as the electrolyte.

According to the relationship between the applied bias potential
and the photocurrent from LSV, we chose −0.1 V as the applied
bias and then measured the photocurrent of the dye + Co-1@NiO WE. The transient photocurrent responses to on–off cycles
under illumination were then investigated, and the results are shown
in Figure 6. As shown
in Figure 6a, for the TB + Co-1@NiO photocathode, it showed a low photocurrent
of −10 μA cm–2 in dark and it can produce
a much higher photocurrent once illuminated, and then the photocurrent
gradually decreases. Finally, it reached a final photocurrent of −12.75
μA cm–2. On the other hand, the TB @NiO photocathode excluded Co-1 only displaying low
photocurrent under the same conditions. Meanwhile, for the TSB + Co-1@NiO photocathode in Figure 6b, it shows similar photoelectrochemical
properties and can give an average photocurrent of −16.94 μA
cm–2. It can be obviously found that the TSB + Co-1@NiO photocathode showed higher photocurrent
than the TB + Co-1@NiO photocathode, which
may be attributed to the higher molar extinction coefficient of TSB and better photovoltaic properties of TSB@NiO including lower charge recombination data. It is worth noting
that the photocurrent values of the TB- and TSB-based photocathodes were both much higher than those of YK-1 in our previous report.38

Figure 6 Transient current responses
to on–off cycles under an applied
potential of −0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl (light intensity 100 mW cm–2), operated in a three-electrode PEC cell with Pt
as the counter electrode and 100 mM pH 7.0 PBS as the electrolyte.

4 Conclusions
In summary, two new organic PMI-based dyes TB and TSB with and without bithiophene π-bridge were successfully
prepared and applied in p-DSSCs and DS-PECs, respectively. The effect
of π-bridge on the photocurrent of p-DSSCs and DS-PECs was discussed.
The UV–vis absorption spectra showed that TSB with
bithiophene π-bridge had a broadened absorbance spectrum and
a higher molar extinction coefficient compared to TB.
As a result, the maximum absorption peaks were located at λmax = 528 nm (27 900 ε/M–1 cm–1) and 534 nm (40 100 ε/M–1 cm–1) for TB and TSB, respectively. Furthermore, the photocurrents of p-DSSCs and DS-PECs
for the dye TSB were increased by 26.9 and 32.9%, respectively,
compared with those of the dye TB. In addition, the TSB-based cell showed the highest PCE of 0.1326% with the
iodide-based electrolyte. EIS indicated that the introduction of bithiophene
π-bridge led to higher hole lifetime and lower charge–hole
recombination data. In the research of p-type dye-sensitized photocathodes,
prolonging the π-bridge chain of the photosensitizer contributes
to the improvement in the photoelectrochemical properties of the device,
which provides strategies for the rational design of the molecular
structure.
