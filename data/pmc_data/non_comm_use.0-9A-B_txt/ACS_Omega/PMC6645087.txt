Efficient predictive
capabilities are essential for the actinide
series since regulatory constraints for radioactive work, associated
costs needed for specialized facilities, and the short half-lives
of many actinides present great challenges in laboratory settings.
Improved predictive accuracy is advantageous for numerous applications
including the optimization and design of separation agents for nuclear
fuel and waste. One limitation of calculations in support of these
applications is that the large variations observed from predictions
obtained with currently available methods can make comparisons across
studies uncertain. Benchmarking currently available computational
methodologies is essential to establish reliable practices across
the community to guarantee an accurate physical description of the
systems studied. To understand the performance of a variety of common
theoretical methods, a systematic analysis of differences observed
in the prediction of structural characteristics, electron withdrawing
effects, and binding energies of [An(NO3)]2+ (with An = Ac to Lr) in gas and aqueous phases is reported. Population
analysis obtained with Mulliken and Löwdin reflect a large
dependence on the level of theory of choice, whereas those obtained
with natural bond orbital show larger consistency across methodologies.
Predicted stability across the actinide series calculated with coupled
cluster with perturbative doubles and triples at the triple ζ
level is equivalent to the one obtained when extrapolated to the complete
basis set limit. The ground state of [Fm(NO3)]2+ and [Md(NO3)]2+ is predicted to have an electronic
structure corresponding to An III state in gas and An IV in aqueous
phase, whereas the ground state of [An(NO3)]2+ (with An = Ac to Es, Lr) presents an electronic structure corresponding
to An IV in the gas and aqueous phase. The compounds studied with
No in gas and aqueous phase present a preferred No III state, and
the Lr compounds did not follow trends predicted for the rest of the
actinide series, as previously observed in studies regarding its unusual
electronic structure relative to its position in the periodic table.

==== Body
Introduction
All
of the actinides are radioactive, with a broad range of half-lives
ranging from seconds to millions of years.1 Yet despite their radioactivity, these elements are of considerable
importance in a number of disparate areas, including military nuclear
applications,2 civilian nuclear power,3−5 neutron radiography,6−8 and radiothermal generators for space missions.9 Furthermore, they are also employed in cancer
treatments and neutron therapy,10−14 in geological analysis in marine sediment modeling,15 and in astronomy.16 Due to their
radioactivity and often short half-lives, they present challenges
for experimental science, which intimates that effective theory could
aide many applications without the need for specialized radiation
laboratories.17−23 Unfortunately, electronic structure calculations performed with
traditional approaches become increasingly more difficult as the number
of electrons and relativistic effects increase, which leads to a higher
computational cost to achieve accuracy.24 Theoretical considerations, including electronic correlation, multireference
character, the interaction of core and valence electrons, and relativistic
effects, intensify challenges and contribute to limitations in investigations
involving the actinide series.25

One research area where improved, reliable calculations would have
immediate impact is on selective binding of ligands to actinides,
which is critical for a range of applications, but in particular,
the civilian nuclear fuel cycle.3−5 Optimization and design of extracting
agents with high binding selectivity depend largely on computational
feedback to reduce the processing cost.26−28 In 2012, Glatz cataloged
all of the industrial processes for handling spent nuclear fuel29 and he noted that nitric acid was essential
in the first step of this process. In the initial phases of nuclear
fuel treatment, all of the actinide elements, such as Ac, Th, Pa,
U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, and Bk, are present in the nuclear fuel depending
on the reactor type. The URanium EXtraction (UREX) and Plutonium URanium
EXtraction (PUREX) methods of removing weapons usable U or Pu from
the fuel cycle both employ nitrates, whereby the spent fuel is divided
into small pieces and dissolved into nitric acid in molarities of
0.5–4 M depending on the process.30 Therefore, we chose the [An(NO3)]2+ (with
An = Ac to Lr) as a model system for calculations due to the importance
of nitric acid binding in actinide separation processes.

Understanding
structural characteristics, electron withdrawing
effects, and binding energies is essential for optimization of separations,
and computational tools can greatly aid in the prediction of these
properties.31,32 Yet, to our knowledge, in-depth
evaluations of level of theory dependence on structural and population
predictions for actinide-containing compounds with nitrates for the
entire series have not been performed. Three metrics have been advanced
across the actinide series for understanding ligand–actinide
interactions: population analysis, structural characteristics, and
binding energies. Population analysis is a useful aid for the analysis
of electron withdrawing effects and their effect on selective binding
to actinides.33,34 Mulliken population analysis
has been extensively used with uranium compounds,35−42 but this type of analysis is largely dependent on the level of theory
of choice, which makes comparisons across different studies uncertain.
Structural characteristics include careful comparisons on bond distances
and angles between the ligand and actinide. Finally, Dolg and co-workers
evaluated the hydration energy across the actinide series through
electronic structure calculations, showing an accuracy of the methodologies
employed to be within 1% of experimental values; however, there was
only experimental data for two actinides (uranium and plutonium).23 In some cases, all of these aspects were evaluated
for a ligand (cyclic imide dioximes) but only with a small subset
of the actinides.33 Last, we note that
the extent of variations in the prediction of these properties for
actinide-containing compounds from utilizing different methodologies
or levels of theory is often problematic as few methods have been
used in systematic studies across the entire actinide series.

One of the most challenging aspects when applying electronic structure
calculations to actinides is assuring the calculation is reaching
the true ground state for the actinide. In many instances, the user
needs to manually alter orbitals to ensure correct orbital occupancies.
However, as the number of atoms increases in compounds, the orbital
mixing is often challenging to fix due to the closely degenerate f
orbitals. Moreover, without a computational protocol that ensures
the compound is in the true ground state, various results can be obtained,
as illustrated in the Results and Discussion section.

In this manuscript, we showcase an exhaustive comparison
of different
methodologies and levels of theory to generate an in-depth understanding
of the performance of electronic structure methods illustrated through
nitrate binding across the entire series of actinides. We address
the dependence of population analysis (part I), structural characteristics
(part II), and binding energies (part III) on the level of theory
of choice through a systematic study of [An(NO3)]2+ structures (with An = Ac to Lr). To this end, gas-phase structures
are optimized with local density approximation (LDA), TPSS, B3LYP,
PBE0, B972, M06, and M11, the Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP and associated
basis set for the actinide atoms including and excluding the most
diffuse basis functions, with the 6-31G*, cc-pVDZ, 6-311++G**, cc-pVTZ,
and cc-pVQZ basis sets for the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Single-point
energy calculations are obtained with coupled cluster with perturbative
doubles and triples (CCSD(T)) and all-electron correlation-consistent
basis sets. Additionally, [An(NO3)]2+ (with
An = Ac to Lr) structures are optimized with an implicit solvation
model and a subset of functionals and basis sets. Evaluation of methodologies
in the prediction of differences amongst contiguous actinides is included
to aid in targeted selective separations across the series.

Results
and Discussion
Unless otherwise indicated, the results discussed
in this section
correspond to An IV configuration and gas-phase calculations. The
An IV and An III notation follows the NIST Atomic Spectra Database
spectra name classifications, which correspond to a defined electronic
structure associated with each state, as shown in Table 1.43

Proper considerations were given to include the ground
state for
all compounds. Several combinations of methods and basis sets initially
converged to an An III configuration. After altering the orbital occupancies
to reflect an An IV configuration, a lower energy was obtained for
[Bk(NO3)]2+ and [Es(NO3)]2+. Calculations with CCSD(T) indicate a preferred An III state for
[Fm(NO3)]2+, [Md(NO3)]2+, and [No(NO3)]2+ in the gas phase, with Fm
and No having energies at least 100 kcal mol–1 lower
than in the An IV state, and Fm and Md in an An IV state in solution.
It has been previously observed that No is found in a divalent state
(An III) configuration in solution,44 due
to stabilization of the 5f shell, which corroborates the correctness
in the evaluated lowest energy configuration state in this study.
Differences in predicted ΔGrxn calculated
between some compounds with the actinide in An IV and An III states
are shown in Table 2.

Part I: Population Analysis
Level of
Theory Dependence
Overall, it is observed
that the partial atomic charges calculated with natural bond orbital
(NBO) are largely independent from the level of theory of choice,
whereas partial charges calculated with Mulliken and Löwdin
showed larger ranges of predicted populations and a strong dependence
on the level of theory of choice. Figures 2 and 3 show the predicted
charge of An in [An(NO3)]2+ calculated with
NBO, Mulliken, and Löwdin, where is it apparent that predicted
charges with Mulliken and Löwdin show fluctuations when utilizing
different combinations of functionals and basis sets, whereas partial
charges calculated with NBO seem largely independent of the level
of theory of choice for all functionals tested. Variations in predicted
partial charge of An in the compounds evaluated with the levels of
theory proposed show a range calculated with NBO, Mulliken, and Löwdin
(indicated order as NBO/Mulliken/Löwdin) for Ac (0.15/0.37/0.65),
Th (0.13/0.47/0.66), Pa (0.24/0.44/0.72), U (0.22/0.45/0.74), Np (0.17/0.39/0.71),
Pu (0.28/0/42/0.80), Am (0.19/0.53/0.75), Cm (0.25/0.52/0.80), Bk
(0.29/0.46/0.75), Cf (0.34/0.46/0.68), Es (0.34/0.48/0.75), Fm (0.42/0.58/0.72),
Md (0.26/0.18/0.35), No (0.14/0.13/0.29), and Lr (0.19/0.44/0.73),
as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Including and excluding the most diffuse
basis functions in the An basis set give negligible differences in
the predicted partial charge of An in the compounds tested with NBO
and the levels of theory previously specified, as shown in Figures 4 and S.1 in the Supporting Information (SI). Significant
differences including and excluding the most diffuse functions with
Mulliken are observed for Ac (up to 0.17), Th (up to 0.32), Fm (up
to 0.28), and Lr (up to 0.11), and with Löwdin for Ac (up to
0.14), Th (up to 0.38), Pu (up to 0.13), Am (up to 0.22), Cm (up to
0.14), Fm and Lr (up to 0.31) (also shown in Figures 4 and S.1 in the
SI). Partial charges calculated with Löwdin show larger overall
differences than those with NBO and Mulliken for Th, Pu, Am, Cm, Fm,
and Lr. All calculated differences in partial charges with NBO, Mulliken,
and Löwdin ad and nd are included in Tables S.1–S.3 in the SI.

charge – smallest predicted charge, as indicated in eq 7a.)

Electron Withdrawing Effects and Orbital Occupancies in [An(NO3)]2+
An An IV configuration is predicted
for all [An(NO3)]2+ structures in the gas phases
for Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, and Lr, whereas an
An III is obtained in the gas phase for Fm, Md, and No. The orbital
occupancies of optimized [An(NO3)]2+ structures
(for An = Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Cm, Bk, Es, Fm, Md, No, and Lr) in solution
calculated with NBO show the 5f occupancy is less than 0.12 from the
values calculated in the gas phase for Ac, Pa, U, Np, Cm, Bk, Es,
and Lr for all options tested. The calculated 5f occupancy is approximately
0.4, 0.9, and 0.7 lower in aqueous phase than in gas phase in [Th(NO3)]2+, [Fm(NO3)]2+, and [Md(NO3)]2+, respectively, for all functional/basis set
options tested, suggesting an An III in the gas phase and an An IV
in solution for Fm and Md.

Overall, the occupancy of the 5f
orbital for the actinides predicted in the optimized structures in
the gas phase is within 0.1 units of those obtained when applying
a solvation model for an aqueous environment for Ac, Pa, U, Np, Cm,
Bk, and Es, predicting an An IV state with all the options tested.
For [Fm(NO3)]2+, optimized structures in gas
phase predict an Fm III state, whereas optimized structures in an
aqueous environment predict an Fm IV configuration. Similarly, optimized
[Md(NO3)]2+ structures in the gas phase predict
an Md III state and aqueous structures predict an Md IV configuration.
For [No(NO3)]2+, the aqueous environment reduces
the 5f occupancy by approximately 0.4 units but it is not fully changed
to an An IV state, which suggests an No III preference in gas and
solution. The change in 5f occupancy in gas and aqueous phase for
[Th(NO3)]2+, [Fm(NO3)]2+, [Md(NO3)]2+, and [No(NO3)]2+ is included in Table 3.

The partial
charge of the actinides in [An(NO3)]2+ in the
gas phase calculated with NBO reveals a charge approximately
between 2.4 and 2.6 for Ac to Es and Lr and approximately 1.9 for
Fm, Md, and No. The 5f orbitals show an occupancy of approximately
1 for Th, 2 for Pa, 3 for U, 4 for Np, 5 for Pu, 6 for Am, 7 for Cm,
8 for Bk, 9 for Cf, 10 for Es, 12 for Fm, 13 for Md, and 14 for No
and Lr. No significant differences are observed in the predicted 5f
orbital occupancies, including and excluding the most diffuse basis
functions in the An basis set. It is possible that these occupancies
suggest an An IV configuration for Ac to Es and Lr and An III for
Fm, Md, and No when bound to only one nitrate in the gas phase, as
proposed in this study. The partial charge calculated with NBO for
An and NO3 in [An(NO3)]2+ is shown
in Figure 5. Predicted
orbital occupancies for all actinides are shown in Tables S.4 and S.5 in the SI.

and nitrogen, and the B3LYP and PBE0 functional. (Numerical labels

are included as a visual aid, and do not represent function continuity.)

Part II: Structural Analysis
Level
of Theory Dependence
Optimized structures with
the levels of theory previously indicated predict structures with
an An–O1 distance with variations between 0.05 and 0.53 Å
and between 0.05 and 0.48 Å when including and excluding the
most diffuse basis functions in the An basis set, respectively, as
shown in Figure 6.
Overall, the largest ranges (as defined in eq 7b) when including all the basis functions
in the An basis set are predicted when utilizing the M06 and M11 functionals,
with differences in predicted An–O1 distance larger than 0.05
Å for Md with B3LYP, PBE0, B972, and M11, Fm with B972, and Es
with TPSS. When excluding the most diffuse basis functions, predicted
ranges larger than 0.05 Å are found with LDA for Pa, TPSS for
Fm, B3LYP for Md, M06 for Md, Fm, Es, and Cf, and M11 for Pa. All
An–O1 predicted distances are shown in Tables S.6 and S.7 in the SI.

N and O, and the Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP for An including (ad) and
excluding (nd) the most diffuse basis functions in the basis set.
Inset shows the overall range per actinide for all predicted values
with all functional and basis set combinations. (Values shown are
in angstrom. Ranges are calculated as indicated in eq 7b.)

The O1–An–O2 angle in predicted structures
shows
a range between 1.45 and 11.24° when including all basis functions
and between 1.32 and 11.46° when excluding the most diffuse basis
functions in the An basis set, as shown in Figure 7. Ranges larger than 1° are predicted
for structures optimized with M11 for Pa, B972 for Md, PBE0 for Fm,
B3LYP for Md, TPSS for Es, and LDA for Cf when including all the basis
functions in the An basis set. When excluding the most diffuse basis
functions in the An basis set, a range larger than 1° is predicted
with M11 for Md, M06 for Cf, B972 for Es and Pa, B3LYP for Pa, TPSS
for Fm and Cf, and LDA for Cf and Pa.

Inset shows the overall range per actinide for all predicted values
with all functional and basis set combinations. (Values shown are
in degrees. Ranges are calculated for angles, as indicated in eq 7b for interatomic distances.)

Structural Changes in [An(NO3)]2+
The predicted An–O1 distance
has an overall gradual decrease
from Ac to Lr from 2.3 to 2.1 Å; however, structures with Fm,
Md, and No showed an An–O1 distance of approximately 2.6 Å
(Figure 8). It is likely
that this difference of almost 0.5 Å is due to Fm, Md, and No
presenting an An III configuration (instead of the An IV from the
rest of the actinide series). Figure S.2 in the SI shows the An–O1 trend for Ac to Es/Lr calculated
with PBE0 including all basis functions. Moreover, Fm, Md, and No
presented variations in An–O1 distance when calculated with
the proposed methodologies, giving an Fm–O1 distance between
2.1 and 2.6 Å, an Md–O1 distance between 2.2 and 2.6 Å,
and No–O1 between 2.3 and 2.6 Å (shown in Figure S.3 in the SI).

Figure 8 Calculated An–O1
distance in [An(NO3)]2+ in gas and aqueous phase
with the B3LYP and PBE0 functional, the
6-31G* and 6-311++G** basis set for N and O atoms, and the Stuttgart
RSC 1997 ECP and basis set including all diffuse basis functions in
the basis set (in angstrom). Labels shown correspond to results obtained
with PBE0 and 6-311++G**. Th and No are shown in Figures 10 and 11. (Lines are included as a visual aid and do not represent function
continuity.)

The predicted O1–An–O2
angle has an overall gradual
increase from 55.6 to 62.3° from Ac–Es to Lr (Figure 9). Similar to the
analysis in the An–O1 distance, the O1–An–O2
angle for Fm, Md, and No shows a large difference in which the O1–An–O2
angle is approximately 10° more narrow than the contiguous actinides
(Es and Lr). Furthermore, a variation in predicted O1–An–O2
angles is observed for Fm, Md, and No structures optimized with the
levels of theory listed in which the O1–Fm–O2 angle
ranges from 49 to 60°, O1–Md–O2 ranges from 49
to 57°, and O1–No–O2 ranges from 49 to 55°.
All values discussed in this paragraph are included in Figures S.4 and S.5 in the SI (with S.5 showing
‘ad’ in grey, and ‘nd’ in black).

Figure 9 Calculated
O1–An–O2 angle in [An(NO3)]2+ in
gas and aqueous phase with the B3LYP and PBE0 functional,
the 6-31G* and 6-311++G** basis set for N and O atoms, and the Stuttgart
RSC 1997 ECP and basis set, including all diffuse basis functions
in the basis set (in degrees). Labels shown correspond to results
obtained with PBE0 and 6-311++G**. Th is shown in Figure 1. (Lines are included as a
visual aid and do not represent function continuity.)

The An–O1 distance in solvated [An(NO3)]2+ compounds is longer than in gas-phase structures
for Ac,
Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, No, and Lr (less than 0.16 Å
for Ac, Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, and Er). It is shorter for
Md and Fm (between 0.33 and 0.36 Å). Similarly, the O1–An–O2
angle is smaller in solvated compounds than in the gas phase for Ac,
Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, and Lr and larger for Th, Fm, Md,
and No. (The An–O1 distances are shown in Figure 8, and the O1–An–O2
angles in Figure 9.)
The O1 and O2 are predicted to be equidistant to the An in [Th(NO3)]2+ and [No(NO3)]2+ in the
gas phase. However, the solvated [Th(NO3)]2+ structures have a difference of up to 1 Å between the An–O1
and An–O2 distance for structures optimized with B3LYP and
0.5 Å for [No(NO3)]2+ compounds optimized
with B3LYP and PBE0, as shown in Figures 10, 11 and S.9, S.10 in the SI.

and the Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP and basis set including all diffuse
basis functions in the basis set (in angstrom). Labels shown correspond

basis functions in the basis set (in angstrom). Labels shown correspond
to results obtained with PBE0 and 6-311++G**. (Lines are included

The structural characteristics of [Lr(NO3)]2+ illustrated in Figures 8 and 9 do not follow
the trend that
would have otherwise been expected from extrapolation of An–O1
distances and O1–An–O2 angles calculated for other actinides
in the series, which is likely due to the electronic rearrangement
occurring due to relativistic effects46−48 that prevents inference
of chemical characteristics for transactinides. This break in the
trendline along the periodic table was similarly observed by Toyoshima.49 A decrease in ionic radii from Cf to Md has
been previously discussed within changes of actinide contractions
across the series,50−53 which is likely affecting the bond length predicted in our study.
The second break to Lr is consistent with recent experimental and
theoretical results that treat it as similar to Lu but distinct from
other later transactinides.54−57

The An–O1 distance (for An = Fm, Md,
and No) in [An(NO3)]2+ compounds is approximately
0.3 Å longer
than in [An(NO3)]+. The O1–An–O2
angle is approximately 8° wider in [An(NO3)]+ than in [An(NO3)]2+, and the O1–N–O2
angle is approximately 10° wider in [An(NO3)]2+ than in [An(NO3)]+. All values are
shown in Table S.8 in the SI.

Part III:
Gibbs Free Energies of Reaction
Level of Theory Dependence
Calculated Gibbs free energies
of reaction of the [An(NO3)]2+ compounds (from
Ac to Lr), as shown in eq 4a with CCSD(T), the cc-pVTZ-DK and cc-pVQZ-DK basis set for N and
O atoms, and the cc-pVTZ-X2C and cc-pVQZ-X2C basis set for the actinides
show the same stability trend as when calculated at the CBS limit,
as indicated in eqs 1 and 2. The predicted Gibbs free energies of
reaction calculated with cc-pVQZ-X2C/cc-pVQZ-DK are within 2 kcal
mol–1 from those calculated at the CBS limit. The
predicted Gibbs free energies of reaction with cc-pVTZ-X2C/cc-pVTZ-DK
are within 3 and 8 kcal mol–1 of those calculated
at the CBS limit (with a difference of 8 kcal mol–1 for Ac and Th; 7 for Pa; 6.0 for U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf; 5 for
Es and Lr; 4 for Md and No; and 3 for Fm). Predicted Gibbs free energies
of reaction calculated with CCSD(T) are shown in Figures 12, 13, and Table S.11 in the SI.

aid and do not represent function continuity.)

Including and excluding the most diffuse basis functions
in the
basis set of the actinide in the calculated Gibbs free energies of
reaction give a difference of less than 6 kcal mol–1 with most levels of theory tested. Exceptions are predicted (listed
in this paragraph specifying the basis set used for the N and O atoms,
in kcal mol–1) when utilizing TPSS for U with cc-pVQZ
(13.20) and Fm with cc-pVTZ (9.98); for B3LYP with Np with 6-31G*

(23.50), and cc-pVQZ (20.30); with B972 for Pu, Cf, and Es with 6-311++G**
(10.13, 7.78, 6.28), and for Md with 6-31G* (16.77); with M06 for
Pu with 6-311++G** (12.50), Md with cc-pVTZ (17.27) and cc-pVQZ (17.54),

Pu with 6-311++G** (10.99), and cc-pVTZ (8.59), Cf with 6-311++G**
(12.26), Es with cc-pVTZ (19.77), Md with cc-pVDZ (7.69), and No with
6-3G* (12.33) and cc-pVDZ (12.24). All predicted differences between
including and excluding the most diffuse basis functions in the basis
set of the actinide are shown in Figures 14, S.6, and Tables S.12–S.16 in the SI.

B3LYP, and PBE0 with the Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP and basis set including
(ad) and excluding (nd) the most diffuse basis functions for An, and
the 6-31G*, cc-pVDZ, 6-311++G**, cc-pVTZ, and cc-pVQZ for N and O.
Δ(ΔG)rxn calculated with CCSD(T),
the cc-pV∞Z-X2C (CBS) basis set for An, and the cc-pV∞Z-DK
(CBS) basis set for N and O is included as reference (indicated as
CCSD(T)/CBS in labels). Values are reported in kcal mol–1. [Δ(ΔG)rxn = ΔGrxn,An – ΔGrxn,Ac, as indicated in eq 5a, with An = Th to Lr.] The lines are included as a
visual aid, and do not represent function continuity.

The difference between the predicted Gibbs free
energies of reaction
with LDA, TPSS, B3LYP, PBE0, B972, M06, and M11 with the Stuttgart
RSC 1997 ECP and basis set including all basis functions and varying
the basis set of N and O amongst contiguous actinides show that the
Δ(ΔG)rxn for Ac/Th is within
12 from those predicted by CCSD(T)/CBS for all options tested.

Differences between Pa and Th (Th/Pa) are between 19 and 36 kcal
mol–1 from those predicted with CCSD(T)/CBS. The
Δ(ΔG)rxn difference is between
−19 and 7 kcal mol–1 for Pa/U, between −8
and 17 kcal mol–1 for U/Np, between −15 and
4 kcal mol–1 for Np/Pu, between −47 and −24
kcal mol–1 for Pu/Am, and between 11 and 17 kcal
mol–1 for Am/Cm. The predicted Δ(ΔG)rxn with all options tested is between −4
and 10 kcal mol–1 for Cm/Bk, between −6 and
12 kcal mol–1 for Bk/Cf, between 11 and 46 for Cf/Es,
between −10 and 30 kcal mol–1 for Es/Fm,
between −38 and −6 kcal mol–1 for
Fm/Md, between −10 and 37 kcal mol–1 for
Md/No, and between −36 and −8 kcal mol–1 for No/Lr (as shown in Figures 15, S.7–S.9, and Tables S.17–S.21 in the SI).

Binding Energies in [An(NO3)]2+
Overall, it is calculated that the [An(NO3)]2+ compounds increase in stability as the atomic number
increases (i.e.,
the Gibbs free energies of reaction, as proposed in eqs 3a and 4a, decrease)
from Ac to Pu and from Cm to No. The stability from Pu to Am is predicted
to decrease with CCSD(T)/CBS and increase with other methods tested
(as shown in Figure 15). There is a slight decrease in predicted stability (less than 6
kcal mol–1) from Fm to Md and a decrease from No
to Lr (approx. 80 kcal mol–1). For [An(NO3)]2+ compounds with solvation, the difference in predicted
ΔGrxn amongst contiguous actinides
was within 20 kcal mol–1 from those predicted in
the gas phase in most cases, with larger differences when calculated
with B3LYP/6-31G* and B3LYP/6-311++G** of approximately 40 and 50
kcal mol–1 for Ac/Th and Th/Pa, respectively, with
B3LYP/6-31G* for Cf/Es, and 30 kcal mol–1 for Md/No
with B3LYP and PBE0 with 6-311++G** (shown in Figures S.10–S.11 in the SI).

The contribution
of the enthalpy (ΔHrxn) to the Gibbs
free energy of reaction (ΔGrxn)
of [An(NO3)](g)2+ is approximately
99%, and the contribution from the entropy term (TΔSrxn) is approximately 1% (shown
in Tables S.22–S.27 in the SI).
When applying the implicit solvation model, the enthalpy contribution
to the Gibbs free energy of reaction to [An(NO3)](aq)2+ is between 84 and 96% and the entropy term contribution
is between 4 and 16% (shown in Table S.28 in the SI).

T1/D1 Diagnostics
The T1 and D1 diagnostic values for [An(NO3)]2+ are between 0.018 and 0.029 for T1 and between 0.065 and 0.136 for D1 for
all actinides except for Pa. The T1 and D1 values for [Pa(NO3)]2+ are 0.075 and 0.358, respectively. T1/D1 diagnostic limits are 0.02/0.10,58,59 0.05/0.15,60 and 0.045/0.1261 for main group, 3d, and 4d metals, respectively.
To our knowledge, there is no such set limit to determine multireference
characters for actinides. The known guidelines for main group, 3d,
and 4d metals are applied to the T1 and D1 values obtained for the [An(NO3)]2+ compounds in this study (shown in Figure 16). The only compound with
both T1 and D1 values higher than limits set for 3d and 4d is [Pa(NO3)]2+. It is possible that a limit set for actinides in
the future could also find [Th(NO3)]2+, [Es(NO3)]2+, [Fm(NO3)]2+, [Md(NO3)]2+, and [No(NO3)]2+ to
have a T1/D1 diagnostic indicative of multireference character. This suggests
that [Pa(NO3)]2+, and likely [Th(NO3)]2+, [Es(NO3)]2+, [Fm(NO3)]2+, [Md(NO3)]2+, and [No(NO3)]2+ should be studied with multireference methods
(which is the focus of future work). All T1 and D1 values are included in Table S.29 in the SI.

for [An(NO3)]2+ (with An = Ac to Lr). Lines
represent limits for main group elements (T1 = 0.02, D1 = 0.1), 3d metals (T1 = 0.05, D1 = 0.15),
and 4d metals (T1 = 0.045, D1 = 0.12).

B1 Diagnostics
The B1 diagnostic for [An(NO3)]2+ (with An = Ac to Es) calculated as indicated in eq 9 is between 6 and 21 for n1, between 3 and 11 for n2, between 2 and 7 for n3, and
between 1 and 5 for n4 (as shown in Figure 17). As explained
in the methods, the B1 diagnostics was
designed for dissociation energies and establishes that the system
for which the B1 is greater than 10 kcal
mol–1 presents multireference character.62 Although there is no bond dissociation in the
proposed reaction, there are two An–O bonds, which would likely
infer an n2 for the B1 diagnostic. For n2, only
[Es(NO3)]2+ is slightly above 10 kcal mol–1 (10.68 kcal mol–1), whereas all
remaining [An(NO3)]2+ (with An = Ac to Cf) had n2B1 values below
10 kcal mol–1. All compounds tested have B1 diagnostic values below 10 kcal mol–1 for n3 and n4. The B1 diagnostic for n1 was above 10 kcal mol–1 for [An(NO3)]2+ (with An = U to Es), but n1 is an nonphysical representation for bonding in the
binding reaction proposed. Nonetheless, it is provided as reference.
All B1 diagnostic values are included
in Table S.30 in the SI.

Conclusions
Computational predictions
are essential for understanding binding
selectivity preferences for actinide separations. Establishing differences
in predictive capabilities from available electronic structure methodologies
and their effect on optimization of structures containing actinide
atoms is essential for the design of selective extracting agents.
This study analyzes the effects various methodologies have in the
prediction of population analysis, structural characteristics, and
Gibbs free energies of reaction in a systematic study of [An(NO3)]2+ structures (with An = Ac to Lr). An An IV
electronic configuration is predicted for [An(NO3)]2+ structures in the gas phase across the series except for
Fm, Md, and No that have an An III configuration; whereas in solution,
all structures except for No present an An IV configuration.

The predicted Gibbs free energies of reaction calculated with coupled
cluster with perturbative doubles and triples (CCSD(T)) with the eXact-2-Component
(X2C) Hamiltonian, the all-electron, correlation-consistent basis
sets (cc-pVnZ-X2C) for the actinide atoms and the cc-pVnZ-DK basis
sets for N and O shows the same trend as that when calculated at the
CBS limit, with the triple ζ level providing a ΔGrxn between 2 and 8 kcal mol–1 lower than those predicted at the CBS limit. Predicted Gibbs free
energies of reaction amongst contiguous actinides seem largely independent
from the basis set of the nonactinide atoms with most functionals
and show a larger dependence on the functional of choice.

Understanding
electron withdrawing effects is essential to design
selective binding agents for actinide separations, and population
analysis can greatly aid in this analysis. On the basis of the findings
in this study, utilizing NBO would minimize having to choose amongst
functional and basis set combinations, as large dependence on level
of theory of choice is observed when utilizing Mulliken and Löwdin.
Excluding and including the most diffuse basis functions in the basis
set of the actinide shows negligible variations with NBO and larger
differences with Mulliken and Löwdin. Although Mulliken population
analysis has been largely the method of choice for various population
analyses in the field, this research suggests a shift to NBO is advantageous
for improved comparisons between studies.

The An–O1 bond
length shows larger variations with respect
to the functional than with respect to the basis set of choice for
the N and O atoms. Moreover, the An–O1-predicted distances
show differences of less than 0.09 Å when including and excluding
the most diffuse basis functions for the actinide atoms. The decrease
in the An–O1 bond length and increase in O1–An–O2
angle in [An(NO3)]2+ across the actinide presents
discontinuities in An–O1 distance for [Fm(NO3)]2+, [Md(NO3)]2+, and [No(NO3)]2+, which showed a longer bond length and smaller angle
in the gas phase due to being in an An III state instead of An IV.
However, for solvated structures, an overall trend is followed from
Ac to Md but not for No, which has an An III configuration in [No(NO3)]2+ both in gas and solution when calculated with
the methods included in this study. Calculations for compounds with
Lr show an An IV preferred state, but structural characteristics including
interatomic distances and angles do not follow the trend including
Ac to Md, as expected given their electronic configuration.

Finally, T1/D1 and B1 diagnostics are performed
to provide insight into the multireference character of the [An(NO3)]2+ complexes studied. Future determination of
limits for the B1, T1, and D1 values for actinide systems
and multireference calculations on the same or similar complexes can
be aided by the B1, T1, and D1 coefficients included
in this study. This study provides in-depth and systematic findings
that can be used as an initial assessment for future work involving
multireference and spin–orbit effects on physicochemical and
thermochemical characteristics across the actinide series (including
other single-reference ab initio methods, as well as basis sets including
all-electron descriptions for the actinides). The results obtained
in this study will provide a strong baseline for future studies evaluating
functionals to provide recommendations for actinide-containing compounds.
Future in-depth studies for NBO predictions will encompass a more
exhaustive set of levels of theory in gas and liquid phases.

Methods
Partial charges, structural characteristics, and Gibbs free energies
of reaction are calculated with various levels of theory for [An(NO3)]2+ structures (with An = Ac to Lr) in the gas
phase optimized with local density approximation (LDA),63 the meta-GGA TPSS64 functional, the hybrid-GGA B3LYP,65 PBE0,66 and B97267 functionals,
the meta-hybrid-GGA M0668 and M1169 functionals, the Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP and
associated basis set for actinide atoms (including and excluding the
most diffuse s, p, d, and f basis functions) for the actinide atoms,
and the 6-31G*,70 cc-pVDZ,71 6-311++G**,70 cc-pVTZ,71 and cc-pVQZ71 basis
sets for nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The ECP on the actinide atom accounts
for scalar relativistic effects by replacing 60 electrons with a relativistic
pseudopotential. Partial charges, electron withdrawing effects, and
orbital occupancies are calculated with Mulliken, Löwdin, and
natural bond orbital (NBO). Aqueous-phase calculations are included
with the B3LYP and PBE0 functional and the 6-31G* and 6-311++G** basis
set for the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The COSMO72 solvation model is utilized for accounting for implicit
solvation effects.

Additionally, Gibbs free energies of reaction
as single-point calculations
are obtained with coupled cluster with single-double, and perturbative
triple (CCSD(T)) method with all-electron, correlation-consistent
basis sets (cc-pVnZ-X2C)19 (where n = ζ
level) for the actinide atoms to account for scalar relativistic effects.
The cc-pVnZ-X2C basis sets are used for the actinide atoms, and the
cc-pVnZ-DK basis sets are used for N and O. The CCSD(T) calculations
include the eXact-2-Component (X2C) Hamiltonian73 to account for scalar relativistic effects. The spin unrestricted
CCSD(T) method [UCCSD(T)] is used for open-shell CCSD(T) calculations.74,75 Complete Basis Set (CBS) energies are included following a two-point
extrapolation using energies from cc-pVTZ-X2C and cc-pVQZ-X2C calculations.
Values obtained at the CBS limit are referred to as cc-pV∞Z-X2C.
The Hartree–Fock energy is extrapolated using a formula from
Karton and Martin76 showed in eq 1. 1  The correlation energy is
extrapolated as
described by eq 2.77 2  The CCSD(T) calculations
correlate the 6s6p5f
electrons of the actinide atom and the 2s2p electrons of the oxygen
and nitrogen atoms in the correlation space. The T1(58)D1(59) diagnostics for multireference
analysis is obtained with CCSD/cc-pVQZ-X2C.

The model reaction
proposed for this study is shown in eq 3a, with eq 3a describing binding in the gas phase
and eq 3b binding in an
aqueous environment. 3a   3b  The Gibbs free energy of reaction
for eq 3a and 3bis calculated as shown in eqs 4a and 4b, respectively. 4a   4b  Relative Gibbs free energies of reaction,
Δ(ΔG)rxn, between two compounds
with contiguous actinides are calculated as indicated in eqs 5a and 5b. 5a   5b  with An.1 and An.2 representing the
An of
the compounds being compared.

The equation representing the
difference between including (denoted
“ad”) and excluding (denoted “nd”) the
most diffuse basis functions in the calculation of Gibbs free energy
of reaction is indicated (eq 6). 6  Ranges are defined as the difference
between
the largest and smallest data points in the calculation of partial
charges (C), bond lengths (re), and Gibbs free energies (ΔGrxn), as indicated in eqs 7a, 7b, and 7c, respectively. 7a   7b   7c  Effects of including (ad) and excluding
(nd)
the most diffuse basis functions in population analysis to calculate
particle charges (C), bond lengths (re), and Gibbs free energies (ΔGrxn) are calculated as indicated in eqs 8a, 8b, and 8c, respectively. 8a   8b   8c  The B1LYP-diagnostic (B1)62 developed by Schultz and
co-workers
is utilized to provide insight into possible multireference character
of [An(NO3)]2+ structures (with An = Ac to Es).
This diagnostic is defined as indicated in eq 9 9  where n corresponds to the
number of bonds being broken.62

The
proposed binding reaction in this study (shown in eq 3a) does not provide bond dissociations.
Since the B1 diagnostic was developed
for dissociations,62 there is no equivalent n for the proposed reaction. Therefore, n is evaluated from 1 to 4 to illustrate the dependence of the B1 diagnostic on n for the proposed
reaction. The n variable evaluated at 1, 2, 3, and
4 is indicated as n1, n2, n3, and n4, respectively.

Additional calculations for [An(NO3)]+ structures
are included when needed for discussion purposes, given findings obtained
for structural characteristics.

Geometry optimization calculations
are obtained with tight tolerances
and extra fine grid. The optimizations are performed without symmetry
constraints to avoid enforcing a preconceived symmetry. Harmonic vibrational
frequencies are included for thermochemical corrections and to verify
that no complex frequencies are obtained. Thermochemical corrections
are calculated for each structure at each level of theory at 298.15
K, except for CCSD(T) calculations that include thermochemical corrections
and geometries obtained with the B3LYP functional, the Stuttgart RSC
1997 ECP including all diffuse basis functions for the actinide atoms,
and the 6-311++G** basis set for nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Harmonic
vibrational frequency calculations reveal that the optimized structures
have all real frequencies (i.e., no complex frequencies are observed).
CCSD(T) single-point calculations utilize MOLPRO2015 defaults.

The NWChem 6.6 package78 is used to
obtain DFT geometry optimizations, harmonic vibrational frequency
calculations, as well as Mulliken and Löwdin population analysis.
The NBO79 population analysis is obtained
with the Natural Bond Orbital 6.0 (NBO6) program.80 Molpro201581 is used for CCSD(T)
calculations. The DIRAC1682 package is
used for Dirac–Hartree–Fock calculations. Basis sets
and effective core potentials are obtained from EMSL83,84
