Carbohydrate-binding modules
(CBM) play important roles in targeting and increasing the concentration of carbohydrate
active enzymes on their substrates. Using NMR to get the solution
structure of CBM14, we can gain insight into secondary structure elements
and intramolecular interactions with our assigned nuclear overhauser
effect peaks. This reveals that two conserved aromatic residues (Phe437
and Phe456) make up the hydrophobic core of the CBM. These residues
are also responsible for connecting the two β-sheets together,
by being part of β2 and β4, respectively, and together
with disulfide bridges, they create CBM14’s characteristic
“hevein-like” fold. Most CBMs rely on aromatic residues
for substrate binding; however, CBM14 contains just a single tryptophan
(Trp465) that together with Asn466 enables substrate binding. Interestingly,
an alanine mutation of a single residue (Leu454) located behind Trp465
renders the CBM incapable of binding. Fluorescence spectroscopy performed
on this mutant reveals a significant blue shift, as well as a minor
blue shift for its neighbor Val455. The reduction in steric hindrance
causes the tryptophan to be buried into the hydrophobic core of the
structure and therefore suggests a preorganized binding site for this
CBM. Our results show that both Trp465 and Asn466 are affected when
CBM14 interacts with both (GlcNAc)3 and β-chitin,
that the binding interactions are weak, and that CBM14 displays a
slightly higher affinity toward β-chitin.

==== Body
Introduction
Protein–carbohydrate interactions
are involved in numerous
biological processes, such as cell–cell recognition, fertilization,
embryogenesis, and tumor metastasis among others.1 Proteins involved in such interactions often have noncatalytic
modules called carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). CBMs are subdivided
into families according to their amino acid sequence similarity. They
are currently classified into seven “fold families”,
which are further divided into three types. Type A binds to crystalline
surfaces, B to glycan chains, and C to short oligosaccharides.2 CBMs also show different ligand specificities,
and there are characterized CBMs that interact with chitin, cellulose,
starch, and other substrates.3

Chitin
or β-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine
(GlcNAc) is a linear and water-insoluble polymer that is an abundant
component in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeleton of crustaceans
(i.e., crab, shrimp, and insects).4 Chitin
is not produced by mammals, making the polymer a likely candidate
to trigger an innate immune response.5 Lectins
and other defense proteins are known to play an important role in
initiating this immune response. Carbohydrate active enzymes contain
many members, among them are chitinases that catalyze the hydrolysis
of chitin. Chitinases are synthesized by both animals and plants that
are not able to produce chitin, which underlines their importance
in their immune defense and thus their ability to survive.6

In humans, two active chitinases have been
reported: chitotriosidase-1
(CHIT1) and acidic mammalian chitinase. In addition, a chitobiase
is synthesized that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a soluble GlcNAc dimer.7,8 CHIT1 is synthesized as a 50 kDa soluble protein able to hydrolyze
chitin.9 This human chitinase is classified
as belonging to family 18 of glycosyl hydrolases (GH18) in the Carbohydrate-Active-enZymes
(CAZy) database (http://www.cazy.org).10 It consists of two domains: a catalytic
domain that adopts the conserved (α/β)8 TIM
barrel form typical for GH18 and a noncatalytic domain in the N-terminal
belonging to a CBM in family 14 (CBM14), which many of its members
are known to bind chitin according to the CAZy database. These two
domains are separated by a proline-rich and extended linker (PT-linker)
that comprises 31 residues. The flexible nature of this linker could
suggest that CBM14 works as a guiding system for CHIT1.11 CBM family 14 has a lectin-like property of
binding small sugars (mono-, di-, and trisaccharides) and is characterized
by its highly conserved “hevein-like” fold.3 The structure has three disulfide bonds that
are important for its structural integrity as found by site-directed
mutagenesis of either of the cysteins involved. It has also been shown
that removal or mutagenesis of its only tryptophan has a detrimental
effect on the CBMs ability to bind chitin.12,13 Moreover, CHIT1 with its CBM degrades chitin faster and much more
efficiently than its isoform without the CBM.14

According to CAZy, there are currently seven structures of
CBM14s.
Only two of the structures have been solved using NMR and correspond
to tachycitin (PDB ID: 1DQC)15 and dust mite allergen
Blo t 12 (PDB ID: 2MFK). The remaining structures have been solved using X-ray crystallography,
among which are CHIT1 (PDB ID: 5HBF) that includes the CBM14 elucidated by
NMR here, Der p 23 (PDB ID: 4ZCE), a dust mite allergen from Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus,16 and PfAvr4 (PDB ID: 4Z4A), an effector protein from the tomato pathogen Pseudocercospora fuligena.17 A structural homolog of PfAvr4 and CfAvr4, an effector protein from the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum, has recently18 been co-crystalized with a chitin hexaoligosaccharide (GlcNAc)6 (PDB ID: 6BN0). This is the first co-crystal structure of a CBM14 with an oligosaccharide. CfAvr4 has an extended binding surface that can accommodate
longer polysaccharide chains and the interaction with the substrate
is through aromatic residues and hydrogen bonds, which is more reminiscent
of a type B CBM than the type C common for CBM14s.3 This protein contains an extended loop that hydrogen-bonds
with the oligosaccharide, as well as linking an additional N-terminal
α-helix to the first β-sheet. It also contains two residues
(Gln69 and Lys84) that through mutation studies are shown to have
a great effect on the binding. These aspects are not conserved in
other CBM14s and can therefore explain the observed difference in
binding mode.

We have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the
solution structure
of CBM14 from CHIT1. As a result, we have developed further insight
into the structural elements important in keeping CBM14s binding affinity
for chitin. This CBM shows a binding affinity toward both (GlcNAc)3 and β-chitin, and through our studies, we have found
that the same residues (Trp465 and Asn466) are involved in binding
both substrates. However, a single mutation of Leu454 to alanine renders
the CBM unable to bind. Leu454 does not show a significant change
in chemical shift perturbation when CBM14 (wild type, wt) interacts
with either substrates. Interestingly, with fluorescence spectroscopy,
we observe that Leu454Ala displays a significant blue shift, meaning
that the position of Leu454 in the protein structure is significant
for the correct orientation of Trp465 and therefore the protein’s
ability to bind substrates.

Results
Solution Structure of CBM14
The solution structure
of CBM14 (PDB ID: 6SO0) was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Assignment of the backbone
and side-chain chemical shifts for CBM14 are essentially complete
(N, HN, Cα, Hα, and C′
> 92%; H and C side chains > 76%) (Figure S1). The mature protein contains the following amino acids
for purification
purposes: three extra amino acids (Gly-Ser-Pro) at the N-terminus
and five extra amino acids (Gly-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg) at the C-terminus.
Gly-Ser in the N-terminus have not been assigned. Due to their location
in a flexible-loop region, Cys460 and Cys462 are not observed because
of line broadening. Chemical shift data have been deposited at the
Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) under the accession
number 27277. The restraints and structural statistics for the 20
best conformers of CBM14 are given in Table S1.

The nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments
show that the CBM14 fold comprises two β-sheets, three antiparallel
β-strands in the N-terminal region (β1, β2, β3;
residues 426–430, 436–442, and 444–449), and
two antiparallel β-strands in the C-terminal region (β4,
β5; residues 455–456 and 463–465). This fold pattern
matches the previously described distorted β-sandwich fold in
the crystal structure of the same protein,11 and is known as the “hevein-fold”. However, the two
structures differ in the amount of amino acids involved in each β-strand
(Table S2).

By aligning the NMR structure
with the crystal structure (Figure 1), we obtain a root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) of 1.59 Å over the secondary structure (3.78
Å over 48 CA residues). The highest deviations are observed in
the loop regions of the CBM.

Figure 1 NMR solution structure of CBM14. Backbone representation
of the
20 conformers with the lowest CYANA target function. The X-ray structure
(PDB ID: 5HBF) is highlighted in blue. By aligning the X-ray structure with the
20 conformers determined by NMR spectra, the calculated RMSD is 1.59
Å over residues involved in β-sheets (Table S2).

Connecting β2 and β3 is a type I turn
(residues 442–444).
The protein contains six cysteins that form three disulfide bridges
(Cys420-Cys440, Cys450-463, and Cys460-462) that have a stabilizing
effect on the β-sandwich, also described by Fadel et al.11 Through the NOESY experiments, we observed NOEs
between two aromatic residues Phe437 and Phe456 involved in β2
and β4, respectively. These residues create a hydrophobic core
holding the two β-sheets together. This core is probably essential
for the β-sandwich fold given the conservation of aromatic residues
in this position in other CBM14s.

Interaction with (GlcNAc)3
The binding properties
of CBM14 and (GlcNAc)3 were investigated using isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC). The shape of the ITC binding curve is
described by the so-called Wiseman c value,19 which can be expressed as follows 1  where n is the stoichiometry
of the reaction, Ka is the equilibrium
binding association constant, and [M]t is the protein concentration. It is well established that c values within the range of 10 < c <
1000 are a prerequisite for meaningful calculations of Ka.19 A Kd of 9.9 mM (Ka = 100 M–1) has previously been observed by Crasson et al.13 With a protein concentration of 45 μM, typical for
an ITC experiment, it is suggested that the c value
would be close to 0.05. It has been shown that binding thermodynamics
can be obtained even if c is in the range of 0.01
< c < 10 if a sufficient portion of the binding
isotherm is used for analysis.20 This is
achieved by ensuring a high molar ratio of ligand versus protein at
the end of the titration, accurate knowledge of the concentrations
of both ligand and receptor, an adequate level of signal-to-noise
ratio in the data, and known stoichiometry. Using this approach, the
fit of theoretical data to the experimental data (Figure S2) for four independent measurements yielded a Kd of 3.1 ± 0.2 mM and a ΔHr° of −1.6 ± 0.2 kcal/mol.
Moreover, a ΔGr° of −3.3
± 0.1 kcal/mol and a ΔSr°
of 6 ± 1 cal/kmol (−TΔSr° = −1.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol) can be calculated
from eq 2. The obtained Kd is close to that previously observed. 2  

Interaction Studies by NMR
To investigate whether binding
of a different substrate, β-chitin, behaved in the same way
as (GlcNAc)3, we performed 15N-heteronuclear
single-quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments on CBM14 alone and CBM14
together with β-chitin. This allowed us to investigate the chemical
shift perturbation to probe the residues involved by comparing the 15N-HSQC spectra of the protein before and after addition of
substrate (Figure S3). The 15N-HSQC spectrum shows the cross-peaks of the amide nitrogens and
amide hydrogens and is often referred to as the protein’s “fingerprint”
spectrum. Upon substrate binding, the environment around the nuclei
that interact changes and, as a result, the corresponding cross-peak
in 15N-HSQC will change. The residues with the highest
changes in chemical shift perturbation often belong to the binding
site. The biggest differences observed in chemical shifts belong to
the side chain of Trp465 (Hε1/Nε1) and Asn466 (Hδ1/Nδ1 and Hδ2/Nδ2), corresponding to the interaction
surface of the protein. Both have previously been described as most
perturbed upon titration with (GlcNAc)3.13 An overlay of 15N-HSQC for the side chain of
Trp465 and Asn466 for CBM14 interacting with (GlcNAc)3 and
β-chitin is given by Figure 2 (the diagram comparing all residues is given in Figure S3). The chemical shift perturbation for
CBM14 interacting with 6 mg β-chitin is not included as the
signals in the 15N-HSQC were broadened beyond detection.
As the chemical shift perturbation is more pronounced for β-chitin,
it could indicate a stronger binding affinity compared to the soluble
(GlcNAc)3.

Asn466
of CBM14. The arrows indicate the direction in the change in chemical
shift of CBM14 interacting with (GlcNAc)3 (red) and β–chitin
(turquoise and purple). This could suggest an increase in binding
affinity for the crystalline substrate. (b) Surface representation
of CBM14 showing Trp465 and Asn466 in blue.

Another residue that shows a chemical shift perturbation
is Thr464.
Mutational studies have been done on this threonine and showed medium
impact on binding activity for Thr464, which could indicate that this
residue could be one of the key polar residues that are directly involved
in binding.13 Furthermore, Cys450 and Cys463
also show a minor change in chemical shift. These cysteins create
a disulfide bridge linking the two β-sheets together.

To allow us to obtain detailed information about the bound sugar,
we performed T1rho NMR spectroscopy on the CBM14- (GlcNAc)3 system using different protein:ligand concentrations. The
resulting one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectra are given
in Figure S4. Compared to the reference
spectrum, the T1rho experiment will display a reduction
in signal intensity if the protein and substrate are bound because
the protein’s relaxation will be observed on the substrate.
We observe indications of substrate binding by getting a reduction
in signal intensity for the methyl groups, H1, H2–H6 for (GlcNAc)3. It is evident that CBM14 interacts with (GlcNAc)3 and the nonreducing end of the trimer seems to be preferred (Figure S4). By knowing the binding site (Trp465
and Asn466) in CBM14, we were able to use a docking algorithm (HADDOCK,
high-ambiguity driven docking). This showed that the lowest-energy
cluster of CBM14 and (GlcNAc)3 coincide with the affected
chemical shifts in the T1rho experiments (Figure S4). We also tried to probe the interaction using a
water LOGSY21,22 experiment, but due to the Hβ
of the reducing end of (GlcNAc)3 being too close to the
frequency for the saturation of the water signal, the spectrum was
inconclusive. To support the indicated interactions in the T1rho experiment, we also did a saturation transfer difference (STD)23,24 experiments varying the protein:ligand concentrations, temperature,
saturation times, and on-resonances. However, no detailed information
could be extracted from these spectra.

Leu454Ala Mutant
Looking from a structural point of
view, this leucine is positioned close to the binding site (Trp465
and Asn466) by β-sheet 2 (β4 and β5). According
to a multiple sequence alignment done using Clustal Omega (1.2.4)
given by Figure 3,
we observe that this particular leucine is conserved in tachycitin, PfAvr4 and CfAvr4. These proteins also
have an aromatic residue (tryptophan or tyrosine) in the same position
as CBM14’s Trp465.

disulfide bridges (orange) and β-strands. The wheat color in

purposes. Residues of particular interest includes their side chain
and are highlighted in cyan (except for Asn466 which is added for
its involvement in binding the substrate). (b) Multiple-sequence alignment
performed using Clustal Omega (1.2.4) compares CBM14 from HCHT with
five other CBM14s. Their sequence is collected from the Protein Data
Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). The conserved residues are highlighted in red, and orange boxes
correspond to cysteins and cyan boxes to the residues in (a).

To obtain insight into the differences between
CBM14 wild type
and CBM14 Leu454Ala mutant, we produced a 15N-labeled mutant
and recorded a 15N-HSQC spectrum. The differences in chemical
shift compared to the wild type are showed in Figure 4. With a threshold of Δδ 0.2
ppm, five residues showed a significant change in chemical shift.
Divided into two groups: Δδ 0.2–0.4 ppm (Thr452,
Hε1/Nε1 Trp465 and Hδ1/Nδ1 and Hδ2/Nδ2 Asn466) and Δδ 0.4–0.8 ppm (Val455 and Thr464).
This mutant has previously been investigated using far-UV CD spectra
and β-lactamase enzymatic activity assays,13 where the conclusion was that CBM14-Leu454Ala demonstrated
a reduced chitin-binding affinity compared to the wild type. To investigate
this interaction further, we recorded a 15N-HSQC spectrum
after addition of (GlcNAc)3. This addition had no effect
on the chemical shifts. The interaction was also probed by adding
β-chitin, with the same result.

the residues affected by
mutation of Leu454 - > Ala454. The changes are divided into two
groups:
Δδ 0.2–0.4 ppm (orange): Thr452, side chains of
Trp465 and Asn466 and Δδ 0.4–0.8 ppm (green): Val455
and Thr464.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Taking advantage of the fact
that CBM14 only has one tryptophan (Trp465), we monitored the structural
impact of alanine substitutions on key binding residues using fluorescence
spectroscopy. The maximum emission wavelength (λmax) provides a measure of the protein’s water exposure. The
resulting λmax for native CBM14 wild type (wt), denatured
(6 M guanidinium chloride), and its mutants are given in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Representation of λmax values of native CBM14
wt, its alanine mutants, and its partially denatured form. The blue
and red shifts are represented at the left part (blue) and right part
(red) of the diagram. The center of the diagram is aligned to the
λmax of CBM14 wt. A structural representation of
the residues showing a significant shift are given to the left of
the diagram. The residues inducing a blue shift after alanine substitution
are colored in blue (Pro451Ala, Leu454Ala, and Val455Ala), and substituted
residues inducing a red shift are colored in red (Thr464Ala and Asn466Ala).
Disulfide bonds are colored in black and Trp465 in purple.

The λmax of the native CBM14 is
353.21 nm, which
is explained by the high exposure of Trp465 to the aqueous solvent.
Most of the mutants have a similar λmax compared
to the native form of CBM14, indicating that an alanine substitution
does not modify significantly the direct environment of the Trp465.

A significant blue shift is observed for CBM14-Leu454Ala and to
a lesser extent for CBM14-Val455Ala. Both residues are located behind
Trp465. A slight blue shift is also observed for CBM14-Pro451A, which
can be explained by its position behind the Leu454 and/or its implication
in the loop formation (Pro451, Thr452, Gly453, and Leu454). A slight
red shift is observed for CBM14-Thr464Ala and CBM14-Asn466Ala. This
suggests that Trp465 is more exposed to the aqueous solvent in the
mutant compared to the wild type due to the smaller side chain of
alanine. The highest λmax (354.01 nm) is obtained
for the partially denatured sample of CBM14 in 6 M guanidinium chloride.

Discussion
Here, we have focused on the solution structure
of CBM14 solved
by NMR and how this protein interacts with (GlcNAc)3 and
β-chitin. This has led to information about structural elements
of this CBM that are vital for its binding affinity. Of particular
interest is Leu454, which is important for orienting the main binding
residue Trp465 correctly. Both residues, as well as the two aromatic
residues creating the hydrophobic core are conserved in other CBM14s,
indicating that these residues create a preorganized binding site
for the substrate.

Use of NOESY experiments enables observation
of a cross-peak between
two hydrogen atoms if they are separated by a distance up to 5 Å.25 This gives rise to a direct determination of
the secondary structure of the protein and therefore differences in
the residues involved in the β-strands for the X-ray and NMR
structures. Together with the three disulfide bridges, the β-sheets
maintain the functional conformation of the CBM. Furthermore, the
NOESY experiments show NOEs between Phe437 and Phe456. Phe437 is conserved
in Der p 23 and tachycitin, but is replaced by a tyrosine in CfAvr4, PfAvr4, and Blo t 12, whereas Phe456
is conserved in Blo t 12, replaced by tyrosine in tachycitin and tryptophan
in the three other proteins. These hydrophobic residues that are part
of β2 and β4 are commonly found at these positions (except
for Blo t 12 where they are part of β4 and β6) and presumably
help linking the β-sheets together. This suggests that the two
aromatic residues are creating a hydrophobic core that helps stabilize
the structure. Altogether, these aspects give rise to the hevein-like
fold characteristic for CBM14.

Another trait in CBM14, as with
most other CBMs, is that it relies
on aromatic residues (often tryptophans) for substrate binding.3 This CBM14 contains a single tryptophan (Trp465)
located on the protein surface in the C-terminus and makes up the
binding site for chitin together with Asn466.13 The tryptophan plays a second role for this CBM by being part of
β5 (residues: Cys463-Thr464-Trp465) that is connected to the
N-terminal by a disulfide bridge (Cys450-Cys463) and a loop. In this
loop region is Leu454 that, together with Val455, was shown to be
involved in a hydrophobic pocket important for chitin binding.13 It is likely that Val455, which is included
in the same β-sheet as Phe456 (β4), and displays NOEs
to Thr464 (in β5), also assists in the structural integrity
of this CBM. This valine is not conserved in other CBM14s and might
not play a significant role in the stabilization of the structure,
but its neighbor, Leu454, is conserved in the CBM14s that contain
an aromatic residue in the same position as our Trp465 (Figure 3).

By looking at the
chemical shift perturbation in the 15N-HSQC between the
mutant Leu454Ala and wild type, both Val455 and
Thr464 display significant changes in chemical shifts. This and the
fact that we do not observe any binding activity to either (GlcNAc)3 or β-chitin suggest a disrupted conformation of the
CBM and therefore an altered exposure of Trp465 on the protein surface.
The importance of Leu454 for the correct positioning of Trp465 is
strengthened by the fluorescence spectroscopy data. A significant
blue shift is observed for the Leu454Ala mutant, indicating that the
tryptophan is less exposed to the surface. When substituted into alanine,
the steric hindrance around Trp465 is reduced and leaves more space
for this residue to be more buried into the structure of the hevein-like
fold. We also observe a smaller blue shift for Val455Ala and Pro451Ala
that supports this theory due to their position (right behind Trp465
and in the loop formation, respectively) in this CBM. This indicates
that CBM14 could have a preorganized binding site, which means that
the role of the hevein-like fold is to keep the tryptophan correctly
oriented for efficient substrate binding.

CBM14 is classified
as a type C CBM,3 and it is therefore able
to bind short-chain oligosaccharides as
also shown by Crasson and co-workers.13 Out of the tested oligosaccharides, they found that CBM14 had the
highest affinity toward (GlcNAc)3. Additionally, this CBM
has previously shown a strong affinity for α-chitin,26 which complements our findings of its ability
to bind β-chitin. However, the ability to bind crystalline substrate
is a feature that is characteristic of type A CBMs that exhibit a
platform-like binding site able to accommodate a crystalline substrate.3 Interestingly, a comparison of the substrates
(GlcNAc)3 and β-chitin shows that the same residues
in CBM14 are affected upon substrate binding.

The importance
of the polar residues below Trp465, which participate
in hydrogen bonding with the polar groups of the polysaccharide, for
substrate interaction is supported by the observed change in chemical
shift for Thr464. We also observe a minor change in chemical shift
for Cys450 and Cys463 (disulfide bridge). Even though these amino
acids are not located directly below the binding site, the disulfide
bridge they create is pivotal for keeping the structural integrity
of the protein intact for binding.

Studies of CBM14’s
ability to bind chito-oligosaccharides
have shown that CBM14 have the best affinity for (GlcNAc)3 (Kd = 9.9 ± 0.8 mM).13 Our investigation using ITC demonstrated a dissociation constant
in the same range with a measured Kd of 3.1 ± 0.2
mM. These Kd’s indicate a weak
binding affinity to (GlcNAc)3. By comparing the 15N-HSQC of the side chains of Trp465 and Asn466 of CBM14 when it interacts
with (GlcNAc)3 or β-chitin (Figure 2), we observe an increase in chemical shift
perturbation for the latter. This indicates that CBM14 has a stronger
binding affinity toward crystalline substrate compared to the previously
observed soluble oligosaccharides.13

The relatively weak (GlcNAc)3 binding to CBM14 enabled
investigation using T1rho experiments. In Figure S4, we observe a decrease in signal intensity for the
methyl groups, H1, and H2–H6 for (GlcNAc)3 in the
T1rho experiment, all indicating binding. Ideally, the
T1rho spectra could indicate a difference in the trimer’s
orientation upon binding with CBM14 by giving differences in intensity
for the sugar signals. From the experiments shown in Figure S4, we see that the nonreducing end seems to be preferred.
This was further tested by using the restraints from the chemical
shift perturbation, where Trp465 and Asn466 compose the binding site
of CBM14 and a model of the trimer as input in a HADDOCK algorithm.
The best model generated supports the observations from the T1rho experiments and suggests a CH−π interaction
between the second sugar ring and the side chain of Trp465 (Figure S5).

Even though weak interactions
are favored in saturation transfer-based
experiments like STD-NMR, detailed information about the (GlcNAc)3 interaction with CBM14 could not be acquired due to spillover
from the saturation of the methyl region of the protein to the methyl
groups of (GlcNAc)3. We have also tried to quantify the
binding kinetics (on/off rate) using stopped-flow spectrophotometry,
but the reaction was too fast for obtaining kinetic details.

It has previously been suggested11 that
this CBM14 functions as a guiding system for its catalytic domain.
Having a CBM help concentrate enzymes onto their substrate is a trait
that can be found in other enzyme–CBM systems.27−30 This can explain the weak binding affinity showed by this CBM as
well as its fast on/off rate. A relatively weak binding and an innate
fast on/off rate would be beneficial for CBM action. CBMs cannot disrupt
the crystalline surface and by this alter the binding interactions
resulting in a decreased binding affinity as observed for, e.g., GHs.
Here, productive binding yielding hydrolysis reduces the number of
binding interactions and greatly weakens the affinity.31−33

Materials and Methods
Protein Production and Purification
13C, 15N, and 15N CBM14 samples were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Precultures were
grown in Lysogeny broth (LB) medium (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast
extract, and 5 g/L NaCl) supplemented with 50 μL of kanamycin
(50 mg/mL) in a shaking incubator at 30 °C, 225 rpm overnight.
Four flasks with 500 mL of LB media and 500 μL of kanamycin
(50 mg/mL) in each were inoculated with 1% (v/v) of the overnight
culture and grown in a shaking incubator at 30 °C, 225 rpm to
OD600 ≈ 0.9 before cooled on ice for 10 min. The
cultures were centrifuged (Sorvall) at 4 °C, 6150g, for 10 min, and the cells were resuspended on ice in 450 mL of
M9 media (6 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl) supplemented with 500 μL of kanamycin
(50 mg/mL), 1.0 g of (15NH4)2SO4, 3 g of glucose (15N label)/2 g of 98% 13C6-D-glucose (13C, 15N label) in
10 mL of Milli-Q water, 50 mL of Spectra 9 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories,
Tewksbuty, MA), 5 mL of Gibco MEM Vitamin Solution (100×), 1
mL of 1 M MgSO4, and 5–10 mL of trace-metal solution
(0.1 g/L ZnSO4, 0.8 g/L MnSO4, 0.5 g/L FeSO4, 0.1 g/L CuSO4, 1 g/L CaCl2).

After media change, the expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated
at 16 °C, 225 rpm, for 20 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation
(Sorvall) at 4 °C, 5000g, 10 min. Resuspension
of the pellet was done in 40 mL of TES buffer at pH 8.0 (3.63 g/L
TRIS, 1.86 g/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 200 g/L sucrose) together
with 1/2 tablet cOmplete ULTRA protease inhibitor (Roche) before proceeding
with centrifugation (Sorvall) at 4 °C, 6150g, 20 min. After removal of supernatant, the cells were incubated
at room temperature for 10 min and then resuspended in 30 mL of MQ
and 1/2 tablet cOmplete ULTRA protease inhibitor (Roche). The suspension
was added to 125 μL of 1 M MgSO4 before the final
centrifugation (Sorvall) at 13 000g, 45 min.
The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 μm Sterile-flip filter
unit (Nalgene).

Purification of the protein was done on an ÄKTA
FPLC instrument
equipped with an anion exchange column (1 mL HisTrap, FF, GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min after the following measures:
The column was equilibrated with five column volumes (CV) of equilibration
buffer at pH 8.0 (300 mM KCl, 50 mM KH2PO4,
5 mM imidazole). The periplasmic extract was loaded onto the column
and unbound protein was removed by 6 CV equilibration buffer followed
by 6 CV washing buffer at pH 8.0 (300 mM KCl, 50 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM imidazole). The protein was eluted with elution
buffer at pH 8.0 (300 mM KCl, 50 mM KH2PO4,
250 mM imidazole). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
was used to confirm the separation and purity of the mature CBM14.

The fractions were then combined and dialyzed (MWCO 6–8
kDa) with desalting buffer pH 8.0 (20 mM TRIS, 50 mM NaCl) (2 h +
overnight) and thrombin digestion buffer pH 8.0 (20 mM TRIS, 50 mM
NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2) (2 h + 2 h).

The isolated CBM14
was released from the carrier protein by thrombin
cleavage (2–3 U thrombin pr mg protein) at room temperature,
3–4 rpm for 2 h before adding cOmplete ULTRA protease inhibitor
(Roche).

An ÄKTA FPLC instrument equipped with a size-exclusion
chromatography
(SEC) column (HiLoad Superdex 75 pg) was equilibrated with SEC-buffer
at pH 7.5 (20 mM TRIS, 50 mM NaCl) for 20 h. The flow rate was 1 mL/min.
Fractions containing CBM14 were concentrated and buffer-exchanged
into the NMR buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.5 or pH 7.0) for
interaction studies. Samples for NMR were made with CBM14 in NMR buffer
with D2O added to a final ratio of 90% H2O/10%
D2O) by centrifugation using Vivaspin 6 protein spin concentrators
(MWCO 3 kDa, Sartorius) at 10 °C, 7000g.

Generation of Mutants of CBM14
Alanine mutants of CBM14
were generated as previously described by Crasson and co-workers.13 The 15N CBM14 Leu454Ala mutant was
produced and purified as described above.

NMR Spectroscopy
All CBM14 NMR samples were prepared
in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 10% D2O, pH 5.5 or
pH 7.0 (interaction studies).

The spectra were recorded at 25
°C on a Bruker Ascend 800 MHz spectrometer Avance III HD (Bruker
Biospin) equipped with a 5 mm Z-gradient CP-TCI (H/C/N) cryoprobe
at the NV-NMR-Centre/Norwegian NMR Platform at NTNU Norwegian University
of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. 1H shifts
were referenced internally to the water signal, while 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to
HDO based on the absolute frequency ratios.34 Backbone and side-chain assignments of CBM14 were achieved using 15N-HSQC, 13C-HSQC, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO,
HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, H(C)CH-TOCSY, H(CCCO)NH, 15N-edited
NOESY-HSQC, and 13C-edited aliphatic NOESY-HSQC. The NMR
data were recorded and processed with TopSpin version 3.5, and the
data were analyzed with CARA version 1.5.35 Backbone torsion angles were predicted using TALOS-N (https://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/TALOS-N/)36 and chemical shits of N, HN, Cα, Cβ, Hα,
Hβ, and C′.

Structure Elucidation
NOE distance restraints were
obtained using 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited
aliphatic NOESY-HSQC. Backbone torsion angles predicted by TALOS-N36 were used as constraints for structure calculation,
as were the three disulfide bridges Cys420-Cys440, Cys450-Cys463,
and Cys460-Cys462. This information enabled structure calculation
using CYANA 3.9837,38 by generating 100 structures
that were optimized using 10 000 steps of simulated annealing.
Using YASARA39 with a YASARA force field,40 energy minimization was done on the 20 conformers
with lowest CYANA target function values (Table S1).

Substrate Binding
The interaction between CBM14 and
β-chitin (Mahtani Chitosan, Veraval, Gujarat, India, milled
and sieved to a particle size of ca. 0.5 mm) was investigated using
NMR spectroscopy. A 15N-HSQC spectrum of 90 μM CBM14
in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 10% D2O, pH 7.0, was
recorded at 25 °C as reference. New 15N-HSQC spectra
were recorded after addition of β-chitin (1, 2, and 6 mg). The
change in chemical shift Δδ (in ppm) was calculated using
the following formula: Δδ = ((ΔδH)2 + (ΔδN/5)2)1/2,41 where ΔδH and
ΔδN are the change in chemical shift for the
amide proton and amide nitrogen (ppm), respectively. The interaction
between CBM14 and (GlcNAc)3 was done as described by Crasson
and co-workers.13

In addition, interaction
studies were carried out with the mutant, 90 μM 15N CBM14 Leu454Ala with two substrates: (GlcNAc)3 (Seikagaku
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) (12 mM) and β-chitin (6 mg).

The interaction between CBM14 and (GlcNAc)3 was studied
by saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR using the following pulse
programs: water LOGSY,21,22 STD,23,24 and T1rho (a spinlock element to measure the T1rho was incorporated in a normal proton experiment with excitation sculping
for water suppression). The water LOGSY was performed at 25 °C
in a 3 mm NMR tube containing 26 μM CBM14 and 400 μM (GlcNAc)3 (protein:ligand ratio, 1:15) in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer
and 10% D2O, pH 7.0. For the STD and T1rho experiments,
four different protein:ligand concentrations (1:100: 3 μM CBM14
and 300 μM (GlcNAc)3; 1:50: 5 μM CBM14 and
260 μM (GlcNAc)3; 3:50: 15 μM CBM14 and 260
μM (GlcNAc)3; and 1:15: 26 μM CBM14 and 400
μM (GlcNAc)3) were tested at 25 °C. The STD
experiments were also done at 15 °C and tested at different saturation
times (0.40, 0.50, 0.75, 0.80, 1.20, 1.60, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00,
5.00 s). The on-resonance frequency was set in the aliphatic region
(0.28, 0.37, and 0.82 ppm), and the off-resonance frequency at −30
ppm.

Docking
High-ambiguity driven biomolecular docking
(HADDOCK) was used to get further insight into the interaction between
CBM14 and (GlcNAc)3. The docking was carried out using
the Easy interface of HADDOCK 2.2 (https://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2/haddockserver-easy.html).42 The PDB file containing the NMR structure
of CBM14 and a model of (GlcNAc)3 was uploaded after being
generated by GLYCAM Carbohydrate builder (glycam.org). Active residues
were Trp465 and Asn466, and passive residues were determined automatically
by HADDOCK as those within a radius of 6.5 Å.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) was performed using the VP-ITC system from Microcal,
Inc. (Northampton, MA).19 Buffered solutions
of 20 mM TRIS and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, were thoroughly degassed prior
to experiments to avoid air bubbles in the calorimeter. An enzyme
concentration of 45 μM was used in the reaction cell with a
volume of 1.42 mL and 12 mM (GlcNAc)3 was used in the ITC
syringe. Aliquots of 8 μL were injected into the reaction cell
at 200 s intervals. The stirring speed was set to be 260 rpm. The
titrations were performed at t = 15 °C and were
completed after 40 injections. ITC data were collected automatically
using the Microcal Origin version 7.0 software associated with the
VP-ITC system. Prior to further analysis, all data were corrected
for heat of dilution by subtracting the heat produced by titrating
12 mM (GlcNAc)3 into plain buffer. The fitting of data
took place by utilizing a nonlinear least-squares algorithm using
a single-site binding model employed by the Origin software, yielding
the equilibrium binding association constant (Ka) and the enthalpy change (ΔHr°). The stoichiometry (n) was set to be 1 based
on the knowledge from the NMR experiments. Errors in Ka and ΔHr° were
obtained as standard deviations from four individual experiments. Kd, ΔGr°,
ΔSr°, and −TΔSr° were calculated from eq 2, and errors in these parameters
were obtained from propagation of error.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The partially denatured CBM14
was prepared by incubating the protein in 6 M guanidinium chloride
during 24 h at 4 °C. Proteins were used at 16 μM in 8 mM
phosphate (Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4) and 16 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.5. A Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter
was used with the software Scan (version 1.1) to analyze the intrinsic
fluorescence of all of the samples. The device was set up as follows:
Excitation wavelength: 295 nm, measured wavelengths: 300–400
nm, excitation fast filter: 2.5 nm, emission fast filter: 5.0 nm,
temperature: 25 °C, with 20 scans for each sample.
