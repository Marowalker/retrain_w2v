Profiling of the
kinase-binding capabilities of an aminopyrimidine
analogue detected in a cellular screen of the St. Jude small-molecule
collection led to the identification of a novel series of FMS-like
tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors. Structure–activity relationship
studies led to the development of compounds exhibiting good potency
against MV4-11 and MOLM13 acute myelogenous leukemia cells driven
by FLT3, regardless of their FLT3 mutation status. In vitro pharmacological
profiling demonstrated that compound 5e shows characteristics
suitable for further preclinical development.

==== Body
Introduction
Acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) is characterized by malignant
proliferation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, leading to
overproduction of abnormally functioning white blood cells. This situation
leads to decreased production of red blood cells, infection, and dysfunction
of organs. AML occurs in roughly 4 per 100 000 individuals;
more than half of the reported cases occur in individuals over 65
years of age.1 Although the use of hematopoietic
stem cell transplants has provided some improved clinical outcomes
in AML patients, there has been very little improvement in patient
prognosis over the past 20 years.2

Normal functioning of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a type
III receptor tyrosine kinase, is important for the development and
proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.3,4 The
binding of the FLT3 ligand to this transmembrane protein causes dimerization
and subsequent FLT3 autophosphorylation, which then triggers the activation
of several signaling cascades, including the RAS, SRC, and STAT5 pathways.5−8 Constitutive activation of FLT3 leads to dysregulated cellular proliferation
of hematopoietic cells, and nearly one-third of AML patients have
mutations in the FLT3 gene.9 Two classes
of mutations are commonly found in FLT3: an internal tandem duplication
(ITD) located in the juxtamembrane domain, which is the most common,
and point mutations at or near residue Asp835.10−14 Typically, an AML patient’s prognosis is worse
if he/she possesses the FLT3-ITD mutation compared to that for patients
having normal levels of wild-type FLT3 (wt-FLT3).15,16

Initially, kinase inhibitors developed for solid tumors were
investigated
as FLT3 inhibitors. Several of these inhibitors, including midostaurin,17−19 lestaurtinib,20−22 crenolanib,23−26 tandutinib,27−29 sunitinib,30−32 and sorafenib,33−36 have been evaluated in clinical trials. These compounds tended to
inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases, thus leading to toxicity due to
off-target effects.37 Subsequently, quizartinib
and crenolanib were developed as more selective FLT3 inhibitors.38−42 The clinical response to FLT3 inhibitors often persists only for
a short duration, with acquired point mutations in FLT3 that impact
the binding of the inhibitors driving the limited response.37,43,44 In particular, FLT3 Asp835 mutants
tend to be resistant to “type II” kinase inhibitors
that bind to an inactive conformation of the enzyme, wherein the inhibitor
is able to make contacts within an allosteric pocket adjacent to the
ATP site due to the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif in the activation loop
adopting a conformation in which it is flipped out relative to its
active conformation.45−48 However, treatment with different FLT3 inhibitors can lead to alternate
sets of acquired mutations, and some “type I” ATP-pocket-binding
inhibitors, which bind within the ATP site but do not reach into the
allosteric pocket and do not rely on specific DFG motif conformations,
such as crenolanib, are able to bind selectively to FLT3 and also
retain their activity against FLT3 Asp835 mutants.23,49,50 Consequently, the development of additional
new FLT3 inhibitors that can retain their activity against commonly
acquired mutations or the use of FLT3 inhibitors in combination therapies
may be potential methods to circumvent the problem of resistance.

While investigating potential compounds of interest identified
during a cellular high-throughput phenotypic screen for a brain tumor
project (results not yet published), the kinase-binding profile of
one of the hits suggested potential use as a FLT3 inhibitor. We therefore
synthesized a series of compounds based on this hit for evaluation
against FLT3 and investigation of their activities in AML cell lines.
Herein we describe the structure–activity (SAR) and structure–property
relationships resulting from this series of molecules.

Results and Discussion
Preliminary
Profiling of the Hit (1)
The
kinase-binding profile of 1 was evaluated using the DiscoveRx
KINOMEscan panel of 468 kinases, with ligand competition being measured
at a single inhibitor concentration of 1 (10 μM).51−53 Selectivity was evaluated through a comparison of the number of
nonmutant kinases with which 1 interacted relative to
the total number of nonmutant kinases tested. Compound 1 reduced ligand binding by >90% for 31 kinases of 403 nonmutant
kinases
tested. Within that set, seven had activity reduced to >99% of
that
of the control. As depicted in Figure 1, 1 bound with the highest affinity to
kinases in the tyrosine kinase family. Further information on the
kinase-binding profile is found in Table S1. Subsequently, the Kd values were determined
for kinases in which compound 1 had blocked the binding
of ligand by >90%, revealing that 1 bound with a high
affinity to FLT3 (61 nM) and a significant but lower affinity to PDGFRB,
the JAK1 JH2 domain, and JAK2 JH1 domain (Table 1). Eleven of the kinases had binding affinities
within tenfold of those for the FLT3 primary target, which is a reasonably
selective binding profile. For instance, previously studied kinase
inhibitors, such as the AKT1 inhibitor GSK-690693, the IGF1R inhibitor
GSK-1838705A, and the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor PP-242,
had similar relative selectivity profiles.54 We also verified that compound 1 inhibited the enzymatic
activity of FLT3. As measured using the Z′LYTE kinase inhibition
assay (ThermoFisher), 1 was a potent inhibitor of the
FLT3WT enzyme (IC50 = 32 nM; 95% confidence
interval (CI 95), 24–43 nM).55 Compound 1 was also a reasonably potent inhibitor of proliferation
for the well-characterized MV4-11 AML cell line, which carries an
FLT3-ITD mutation (EC50 = 320 nM; CI 95, 160–650
nM). This finding suggested that 1 acts on FLT3-ITD in
these cells. Although aminopyrimidines have been well studied as kinase
inhibitors, low-molecular-weight structures that include an aliphatic
moiety, such as 1, are not as widely reported and, to
the best of our knowledge, have not been described specifically as
FLT3 kinase inhibitors.56,57 Taken together, the
promising activity profile and fairly novel structural character of 1 prompted us to explore additional SARs.

Chemistry
We developed a general route for the synthesis
of the majority of the compounds discussed herein (Scheme 1) on the basis of prior work
on Aurora kinase inhibitors.58 The route,
which relied upon sequential additions of an aliphatic amine and various
anilines to 2,4-dichloropyrimidine, facilitated systematic variation
of the amine substituents at the 2- and 4-positions of the pyrimidine
ring. Whereas the first substitution using an aliphatic amine typically
proceeded facilely at either 0 °C or room temperature (rt), subsequent
reactions with the anilines required increased temperature and catalytic
HCl. Anilines were obtained either from commercial vendors or were
synthesized via the Suzuki reaction or other known procedures (Schemes S1–S6).59,60 To help define the minimal pharmacophore, we investigated the impact
of removing nitrogen atoms from the scaffold. Pyridine analogues were
synthesized by the routes shown in Schemes 2 and 3. These involved
nucleophilic addition of cyclohexylamine to the halopyrimidine, followed
by a palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction to install the 3-pyridinyl-3-ylaniline
functional group. Schemes 4–7 depict the routes used to synthesize analogues in which the
amine linkers at the 2- and/or 4-positions of the aminopyrimidine
were replaced with N-methyl or oxygen. N-Methylcyclohexane was installed at the 2-position by treating with
triethylamine (Scheme 4), whereas cyclohexanol was incorporated by reacting with 2,4-dichloropyrimidine
in the presence of sodium hydride (Scheme 5). Substituents at the 4-position were installed
using catalytic HCl and by refluxing in ethanol (EtOH) (Schemes 4–7). Overall, the routes proceeded with sufficient yield (3–85%
yield), producing all targeted analogues for characterization, although,
undoubtedly, further optimization could be beneficial for individual
analogues. All compounds used for subsequent testing were purified
to greater than 95% purity, as confirmed by the combination of liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and 1H NMR studies.

SAR
We utilized the FLT3WT enzyme assay
to determine the potencies of all analogues of 1 made
during this study (Table S2). In parallel,
we tested the effects on the proliferation of MV4-11 cells (Table S2). We also measured the effects of these
compounds on the proliferation of untransformed BJ fibroblasts to
evaluate the dependency of cellular effects upon the presence of a
driving FLT3 mutation (Table S3). Because
cellular assays include fetal bovine serum within the media, there
is a potential that the EC50 values could differ from the
actual values due to plasma protein binding.61 The solubility and permeability as well as the potential susceptibility
to P-glycoprotein (PGP) efflux were assessed for selected compounds
(Tables S4 and S5) to aid in interpreting
the data and planning for structural modifications.

The initial
focus of the project was defining the minimal pharmacophore for the
inhibitors. Replacement of the nitrogen at the 1-position with a carbon
atom (9) did not have a large impact on potency for kinase
inhibition but completely ablated effects upon proliferation of MV4-11
cells (Table 2). Removal
of the nitrogen at the 3-position (13) reduced the potency
of kinase inhibition compared to that of 1, while adding
weak antiproliferative effects on untransformed BJ cells (Table S3). Compound 14, in which
the location of the ring nitrogen had shifted, exhibited good enzymatic
inhibitory potency but lacked MV4-11 cellular activity and also was
weakly active against BJ fibroblasts (Table S3). Therefore, the pyrimidine core was necessary for optimal activity.

We examined the effects of replacing
the linker atoms on both FLT3
inhibition and MV4-11 proliferation using both N-methyl
and ether replacements (Table 3). Although replacement of the 2-amine with N-methyl abrogated activity against FLT3 (21, 17), 17 possessed modest cellular potency, which might
be due to metabolic removal of the methyl groups (unexplored). Replacement
of the amine linkers with ethers at either the 4-position (19) or both the 2- and 4-position (20) did not greatly
impact the enzymatic activity, whereas replacement of only the 2-nitrogen
with an ether linkage did reduce the enzymatic activity nearly 40-fold
compared to that of 1 (22). However, compounds 19, 22, and 20 were all devoid of
effects on MV4-11 cell proliferation. Although the lack of enzymatic
inhibition exhibited by N-methylated compounds 17 and 21 could suggest that a key hydrogen-bonding interaction may
be made with FLT3 through the amine at the 2-position, compound 20, which contains an ether at this location, also demonstrated
potent FLT3 inhibition. Therefore, it is not clear what particular
interactions occur between these compounds and the kinase. Overall,
however, the inclusion of amine linkers at the 2- and 4-position provided
the best combination of enzymatic and cellular activity. On the basis
of these results, we focused on the 2,4-aminopyrimidine scaffold for
further optimization.

Next, we explored the replacement
of the pendent hydrophobic groups
surrounding the aminopyrimidine scaffold. First, the cyclohexyl substituent
at the 4-position was fixed, while the substituent at the 2-position
was systematically varied (Table 4). Paring the structure down by removing the pyridine
ring (4a) caused a reduction in FLT3 inhibitory activity
and ablated activity in MV4-11 cells; therefore, this functional group
may improve binding to FLT3 through a potential a H-bonding interaction.
Reductions in FLT3 inhibition and MV4-11 cellular activity were also
observed with compounds 4c–f, which
also did not contain the pyridine ring in 1. Replacement
of the 3-(pyridin-3-yl)aniline moiety with either 2- or 3-substituted
biphenyl (4b, 4g) abolished all activity.
Incorporation of a 3′-methoxybiphenyl (4i) or
methyl ester (4j) led to a reduction in enzymatic and
MV4-11 cellular activities compared to those of 1, and
these compounds also gained weak activity against BJ cells (Table S3). Shifting the location of the ring
nitrogen (4h) reduced the activity compared to that of 1. However, replacement of the 3-pyridinyl group with other
nitrogen-containing heterocycles was tolerated by FLT3 (4k–n), further suggesting that a nitrogen atom
in this position may provide critical interactions with FLT3. Compounds 4o, 4p, and 4r, which also lacked
a pyridinyl nitrogen, showed diminished FLT3 inhibition compared to
that by 1 as well. Although compound 4q contained
the desired pyridine ring, altered molecular conformations may have
led to this compound’s lack of activity. Compound 4s also exhibited good activity, suggesting that the carboxamide moiety
may be in a beneficial location for hydrogen-bonding interactions
with FLT3. Inclusion of a pyridine ring at the para position (4t) provided modest FLT3 activity but good MV4-11 cellular
activity. Although compound 4u was inactive against FLT3,
an effect on MV4-11 cell proliferation was observed. The potential
off-target kinase activity of this compound was not investigated,
but interactions with other kinases may contribute to the moderate
cellular activity of compounds 4t and 4u. Taken together, these results point to a very strong preference
for particular steric and electronic arrangements on this portion
of the molecule, with the original 3-pyridinylphenyl presenting a
good balance of properties.

2-Position for Compounds 1 and 4a–ua
a IC50 and EC50 values are reported as the mean of triplicates.
Values for CI 95
are included in Table S3.

In parallel, we synthesized a series
of compounds keeping the 3-pyridinyl-3-ylaniline
moiety constant, while varying the aliphatic substituents at the 4-position.
Short linear, branched, and cyclic aliphatic groups were evaluated
(Table 5). Although
reduced enzymatic inhibition and a loss of MV4-11 cellular activity
was observed when replacing the cyclohexyl group with a methyl (5a), good potency was obtained with either an ethyl (5b) or propyl (5c) group and moderate potency
was obtained with a butyl (5d) group. Branched alkyl
chains, such as isopropyl (5e), sec-butyl
(5j, 5k), and tert-butyl
(5f), provided improvements in the FLT3 inhibitory activity
and approximately 10-fold improvements in MV4-11 growth inhibition
relative to those of 1. Inclusion of ether (5g), ester (5h), or carboxylic acid (5i)
functionalities within the branched aliphatic substituents greatly
reduced cellular activity. Although 5g had good solubility
and permeability, the lower stability of the methoxy group in the
cellular environment may have impacted its cellular activity (not
explored). Some compounds with aliphatic rings, such as 5l and 5m, demonstrated good enzymatic and cellular activities.
Although both the cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl (5n) groups
afforded good potency against the FLT3 enzyme, poor solubility (Table S4) may have hampered the cellular activity
of the latter. Despite its low solubility, compound 5o exhibited good cellular activity. Therefore, additional properties
beyond solubility could potentially have subtle effects on activity.
Although 5q was approximately 4-fold more potent than 1 against FLT3, the potency against MV4-11 cells was not improved
due to poor cellular permeability (Table S4). Inclusion of a methoxy group (5p) was not beneficial.
Replacing the amine functionality in the aliphatic ring of 5q with an ether (5r) provided only moderate enzymatic
and cellular activities.

b On the basis of assay conditions,

Because of its improved activity
against FLT3 and MV4-11 cells
compared to that of 1, we fixed the 4-position as the
isopropyl group and varied the 2-position of the compound to determine
whether the activity trends observed would be similar to those in
the cyclohexyl series, as previously shown in Table 4. Similar to that in the cyclohexyl series,
inclusion of a methoxy group (6e) or replacement of the
pyridine functionality with a 2-, 3-, or 4-biphenyl (6a, 6c, 6m) caused decreases in both FLT3
inhibitory activity and cellular potency (Table 6). Inclusion of a tert-butyl
group in place of the pyridine ring (6b) abrogated activity
as well. Shifting the nitrogen from the 3-position to the 2-position
(6d) or the 4-position (6l) also reduced
potency, paralleling our prior observations and suggesting that a
nitrogen at the 3-position may act as an H-bond acceptor to make an
important binding interaction. Incorporation of a methyl ester (6f) led to reduced activity. The potency was comparable to
that of 1 when the 3-pyridinyl group was replaced with
a pyrazole (6i), and inhibition of MV4-11 cell proliferation
improved when an imidazole (6j) or pyrazine (6k) replaced the pyridine. Compounds containing oxazole (6g) or thiazole (6h) moieties, however, provided less
potent FLT3 inhibition and MV4-11 cellular activity. Similar to the
effect observed with 4s, the carboxamide-functionalized
compound 6n also exhibited moderate enzymatic inhibition
and activity against MV4-11 cells.

On the basis of the balance
of activity, we selected 5e for further profiling. The
compound retained its FLT3 potency (3.6
nM) and selectivity on the basis of profiling the Kd values for a subset of kinases inhibited by 1 (Table 7). Despite
potent binding to PDGFRB (28 nM) and the JAK1 JH2 domain (28 nM), 5e was still approximately 8-fold more potent against FLT3.
Therefore, modifications explored during the SAR studies did not appear
to significantly affect kinase selectivity compared to that of the
initial hit compound.

In Vitro Effects against FLT3 Mutants and MOLM13 Cells
Because of the demonstrated activity of this series of compounds
in MV4-11 cells, we evaluated a subset of compounds to determine whether
they inhibited the proliferation of other FLT3 mutant AML cells. The
initial hit compound 1 and 5e, 6k, and a structurally related inactive compound 6a were
tested for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of MOLM13 cells,
which also contain the FLT3-ITD mutation, and a sorafenib-resistant
progeny of MOLM13 that has acquired an additional tyrosine kinase
domain (TKD) mutation, Asp835.50 As shown
in Figure 2, 6k was the most potent at inhibiting MOLM13 cell viability
(IC50 = 45 nM; CI 95, 38–55 nM), followed by 5e (IC50 = 136 nM; CI 95, 112–164 nM). The
relative sensitivity of MOLM13 cells to 5e and 6k was correlated to the loss of FLT3-ITD phosphorylation
and downstream STAT5 signaling, with FLT3 IC50 values estimated
to be within 50–100 nM in these experiments (Figure 3). In addition, all three tested
compounds (1, 5e, and 6k) possessed
similar growth inhibitory potencies against both parental MOLM13FLT3-ITD and progeny MOLM13FLT3-ITD/D835Y cells. We also determined the Kd values for compounds 1, 5e, and 6a against several FLT3 mutants (Table 8).62 Compound 5e bound more tightly to all FLT3 variants tested compared
with 1, whereas 6a did not bind to any FLT3
variant at any tested concentration. Therefore, there was very good
correlation between the improved potency of 5e against
MOLM13 cells and improved binding to FLT3 variants. Interestingly,
the fold-difference in the affinities of 5e and 1 was very similar between the FLT3 and Asp835 mutants, which
is mirrored by similar potencies in parental and kinase inhibitor-resistant
MOLM13 cells. This is a desirable profile for a new FLT3 inhibitor
scaffold. Previously studied type I kinase inhibitors have also had
similar to better affinities for FLT3, FLT3-ITD, or activating TKD
mutations, suggesting that these compounds may have the properties
of a type I inhibitor, which binds in the ATP-binding pocket of the
kinase.63 Additionally, when selected compounds
were evaluated in the Z′LYTE FLT3 kinase inhibition assay under
standard conditions but using either a lower (100 μM) or higher
(2.5 mM) concentration of ATP, shifts in the FLT3 IC50 values
of these compounds were observed. For instance, the IC50 of the initial hit, 1, was reduced to <6 nM in the
presence of 100 μM ATP and increased to 116 nM (CI 95, 70–193
nM) when the assay was conducted at a 2.5 mM ATP concentration. Similar
to other type I kinase inhibitors, these compounds may make crucial
binding interactions within the ATP site and therefore may not be
sensitive to the conformation of the DFG motif.

In Vitro ADME Studies
We evaluated the in vitro pharmacological
characteristics of 1, 5e, and 6k to assess their potential for use in in vivo studies. All three
analogues had excellent passive permeabilities (1880 ± 170 ×
10–6, 2000 ± 190 × 10–6, and 1870 ± 60 × 10–6 cm/s, respectively),
as measured in the PAMPA assay. Neither 1 nor 5e showed susceptibility to PGP efflux (Table S5) in cellular permeability assays. Compound 6k was not
evaluated in this assay. Although the solubility of 1 in PBS was poor (0.4 ± 0.9 μM), that of 5e was reasonable (26.4 ± 17.0 μM). Finally, the stability
of these three compounds in liver microsomes from four species was
lower than desirable (Table 9). However, the plasma stability of 5e and 6k was excellent (>48 h). Overall, these studies would
predict
reasonable oral absorption for 5e but rapid clearance
(CL) for all three, and it would be expected that first-pass metabolism
effects could cause low bioavailability.

In Vivo Pharmacokinetics
On the basis of the results
from the microsomal stability studies of 1, 5e, and 6k, we selected 5e to evaluate in
vivo pharmacokinetics at three doses by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.
A greater than proportional dose-dependent increase in Cmax (Table 10) was observed (327, 927, and 1625 nM for 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg
respectively) and the half-life of the compound ranged from 0.23 to
1 h, paralleling our observations in mouse microsome models (0.2–1
h at 0.8–20 μM). The area under the concentration–time
curve (AUC) within 24 h also displayed a dose-dependent trend. CL,
however, was high at all doses tested. Therefore, because of the undesirable
pharmacokinetic profile of 5e, we did not pursue efficacy
modeling using a human AML xenograft model with this compound because
its pharmacokinetic properties could potentially confound the results
of such a study.

Conclusions
Starting with hit compound 1, we developed a SAR concerning
inhibition of FLT3 enzymatic activity and MV4-11 cellular proliferation.
Overall, the SAR for enzymatic inhibition and inhibition of cellular
proliferation correlated well. We found that the pyrimidine nitrogens
and nitrogen linker atoms were important for MV4-11 cellular activity.
Inclusion of a 3-pyridinylphenyl group at the 2-position and a small
aliphatic substituent at the 4-position provided a balance of potency,
solubility, and permeability (Figure 4). Additionally, the pan-activity against FLT3 mutations
and the relatively high selectivity for FLT3 were both generally maintained
during the SAR studies, suggesting that the scaffold might provide
good lead molecules for further development. From these studies, we
developed 5e, which not only had improved potency against
FLT3 and MV4-11 cells but also demonstrated activity in MOLM13 cells
possessing FLT3-ITD and FLT3 inhibitor-resistant TKD mutations. Compound 5e possessed acceptable in vitro ADME properties and was selected
for additional preclinical studies. However, because of its low metabolic
stability and high CL in pharmacokinetic studies, we determined that
these properties need to be improved before further preclinical studies
are undertaken. Efforts toward this goal are on-going.

Experimental Section
Chemistry
All
chemical reagents were purchased from
commercial suppliers (Acros, Combi-Blocks, Enamine, Oakwood, Sigma
Aldrich, Strem) and were used without further purification. Solvents
were dried using a column-exchange system64 Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using Merck Millipore
silica gel 60G F254 glass plates and visualized using a
254 nm UV lamp for detection. Microwave experiments were carried out
using a Biotage Initiator system. Automated flash chromatography was
performed using the Biotage SP1 flash column system with silica gel
SNAP columns or C18 SNAP columns for reversed-phase purifications.65Rf values are quoted
for the eluent system stated. Evaporation was carried out using a
Büchi Rotovapor. NMR spectra were recorded on either a Bruker
400 MHz or Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer in the solvents indicated,
and the spectra were processed using MestReNova (8.1) referenced to
the solvent peak. Melting points were obtained using a Büchi-545.
Optical rotations were recorded using a Jasco P-1010 polarimeter at
the D line of sodium (λ, 589 nM). Purity was assessed using
ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS;
Acquity PDA detector, Acquity SQ detector, and Acquity UPLC BEH-C18
column, 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm2; Waters Corp.).
Data were acquired using Masslynx, version 4.1. The flow rate was
0.5 mL/min, and the gradient started with 95% A (0.1% formic acid
in H2O), changed to 95% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile),
and then returned to 95% A. The mass spectrometer was operated in
the positive-ion mode with electrospray ionization. Verification of
enantiopurity was conducted using supercritical fluid chromatography
with a Chiralcel OD-H (4.6 × 250 mm2) or Chiralcel
AD-H (4.6 × 250 mm2) column. The compounds were purified
to ≥95% purity and assessed using LC/MS by UV/evaporative light
scattering detector detection, unless stated otherwise, and efficacy
data were obtained only on compounds that were ≥95% pure.

Biology
Biochemical Assays
Briefly, kinase reactions were conducted
in triplicate, with a final assay volume of 10 μL, in black
polystyrene 384-well plates (Corning #8849BC) using the Z′-LYTE
Kinase Assay Kit (Tyr 2 peptide; Life Technologies). The reaction
mixtures contained 500 μM ATP, 2 μM Tyr 2 peptide, and
6.25 or 12.50 nM recombinant human FLT3 (571–993 (SignalChem)
in buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA,
0.01% Brij-35, 0.25 mM DTT]). A cocktail of FLT3, ATP, and peptide
solution prepared in the above-described buffer (10 μL) was
added to the plates using an automated plate filler (Wellmate, Matrix).
DMSO stock solutions of the test compounds were then added in a dilution
series by pin transfer (V&P Scientific) in nanoliter volumes.
After 1 h of incubation at 23 °C, the reaction mixtures were
quenched and processed according to the Z′-LYTE kit protocol
and read on an automated EnVision (Perkin-Elmer) plate reader using
a 400 nm excitation filter and a 535 nm emission filter. Fluorescence
emission ratio data were processed using a custom script written in
Pipeline Pilot (Accelrys) to transform data by log10 and
calculate percent inhibition normalized in comparison to the means
of positive and negative controls. Dose–response curves were
plotted using GraphPad Prism software.

MV4-11 and BJ Cell Culture
and Cytotoxicity Studies
BJ and MV4-11 cells were purchased
from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia). The cells were cultured in
a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C according to
vendor recommendations. BJ cells are cultured in EMEM media and MV4-11
cells are cultured in IMDM media purchased from ATCC; both lines are
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, Utah). The cells were routinely tested
for mycoplasma with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza,
Walkersville, MD).

Approximately 1000 BJ or 500 MV4-11 exponentially
growing cells were plated per well (30 μL) in white polystyrene
flat-bottom sterile 384-well tissue-culture-treated plates (Corning,
Tewksbury, MA) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator. Compound solutions (DMSO) were pin-transferred
(V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA) the following day. Inhibition
of proliferation was determined following 72 h of incubation using
Promega Cell Titer Glo Reagent according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Luminescence was measured on an Envision plate reader
(Perkin-Elmer).

MOLM13 Cell Culture
Parental MOLM13FLT3-ITD cells harboring FLT3-ITD (DSMZ,
Brunswick, Germany) and
MOLM13FLT3-ITD/D835Y cells carrying an additional D835Y mutation
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.9,50 The MOLM13FLT3-ITD/D835Ycells were maintained in the presence of 5μM tandutinib
(LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) and removed from the presence of the
drug 3 days prior to experimentation

MOLM13 Cell Viability
Cell viability upon drug treatment
was assessed using the MTT reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,
IN), as previously described.50 Briefly,
the cells were plated overnight in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator
at 37 °C. On day 2, the cells were treated with DMSO or drug
reconstituted in DMSO for 72 h. The drug concentrations used were
as follows: compound 1, 1000–167 nM; compound 5e 1600–6.55 nM; compound 6a, 1000–6.55
nM; and compound 6k, 1500–0.98 nM. Three individual
experiments were conducted, with six replicates each. Cell viability
was quantified as relative percentage to DMSO-treated cells, and cell
viability curves were generated using GraphPad Prism software version
6.07.

Western Blot Analysis
Whole-cell lysates were made
with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40,
1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors).
Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-FLT3 antibody and Protein
A/G agarose beads from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Invitrogen
Bis–tris-gradient mini or midi gels were used for western blot
analysis, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
reagent. Primary antibodies used were from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA): FLT3, phospho-FLT3, STAT5, and phospho-STAT5. Secondary
antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch and Cell Signaling Technology.

In Vivo Pharmacokinetic Study
All animal studies were
carried out under a St Jude Children’s Research Hospital IACUC-approved
protocol (#477). Female C57BL/6 mice, with an average weight of 18
g, were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).
Food and water were provided ad libitum. Twenty-four mice were divided
into four dosage groups: 0, 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg. For each mouse, 0.1
mL of the compound suspension in formulation (5:50:45, EtOH/PEG400/PBS
(pH 7.4), v/v/v) was administered by i.p. injection. Blood (0.1 mL)
was collected retro-orbitally from a different mouse within each dosage
group at 5, 15, and 30 min and 1, 4, and 24 h. The animals were euthanized
via cardiac puncture after anesthesia at 48 h post injection. The
blood samples were treated with 10 μL of EDTA sodium solution
to prevent coagulation. The blood samples were kept under ice and
centrifuged for 3 min at 13 200 rpm in a desktop centrifuge
to collect plasma. The plasma samples (25 μL) were combined
with 75 μL of internal standard (2 μM warfarin) in acetonitrile
in a 96-well plate and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant (40 μL) was collected and mixed with two parts
of deionized water and centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 20 min at
4 °C. The plasma concentration was determined using an LC/MS–MS
assay with multiple reaction monitoring detection (AB Sciex, Framingham,
MA). The LC/MS–MS method is provided in the Supporting Information. The assay limit of quantification
(LLOQ) was 13.7 nM in plasma.

The processed plasma concentration–time
data were analyzed using noncompartmental analysis (NCA) in WinNonlin
6.0 with the Plasma (200–202) model type; all standard NCA
parameters were estimated via default software settings, using predicted
parameter estimates. If at least two-thirds of the observed concentrations
were below the LLOQ, the mean concentration was treated as missing.

The AUC was calculated with the linear trapezoidal, linear interpolation
rule using mean concentrations and nominal times. The terminal elimination
rate (Lambda_z) and half-life (HL_Lambda_z) were determined using
the default “Best Fit” method. The predicted AUC from
the last time point to infinity (AUCINF_pred) was calculated as AUClast
plus Clast(pred)/Lambda_z. CL was calculated as Dose/AUCINF_pred.
