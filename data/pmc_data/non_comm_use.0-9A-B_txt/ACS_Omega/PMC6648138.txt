Here, we report the
synthesis of Fe-doped ZnO/reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) nanocomposites for gas sensing applications via a one-pot
hydrothermal process. A wide range of characterization techniques
were used to confirm the successful fabrication of the nanocomposite
material and to determine the surface area, the structural and morphological properties,
the chemical composition, and the purity of the samples, such as Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, Raman spectroscopy,
scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV–vis
spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The
gas sensing performance to formaldehyde was studied thoroughly in
a temperature-controlled test chamber. Compared to that of the bare
ZnO and ZnO/rGO nanocomposites, the as-prepared 5 atom % Fe-doped
ZnO/rGO nanocomposites presented significantly enhanced gas sensing
performance to formaldehyde at relatively low temperatures. Whereas
most formaldehyde sensors operate at 150 °C and can detect as
low as 100 ppm concentrations, the presented sensor can detect 5 ppm
formaldehyde at 120 °C. Its fast response–recovery time,
high stability, and high selectivity make it an ideal sensor; however,
it can exhibit degenerative gas sensing performance at elevated relative
humidity. The enhanced gas sensing mechanism was explained as the
synergic effect of rGO and Fe doping. The results demonstrate that
Fe doping and decorating the nanocomposite with rGO are promising
approaches for achieving a superior gas sensing performance for the
development of ZnO gas sensors for the detection of formaldehyde.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Formaldehyde
(chemical formula: HCHO) is a naturally occurring
gas, which is frequently encountered in everyday life and has a potential
hazard to human health.1 The World Health
Organization (WHO) pointed out that a long-term exposure to formaldehyde
even in low concentration can cause leukemia and cancer of blood-forming
organs and young children are especially sensitive to it.2 Hence, the trace detection of formaldehyde is
vital for healthcare and environmental protection and the development
of highly sensitive, low-power sensors with good formaldehyde selectivity
is sorely needed.

Metal oxide-based chemical sensors (MOSs),
such as SnO2,3 WO3,4 In2O3,5 ZnO,6 and Cu2O7 have been proposed as promising candidates
for the detection of
toxic pollutant gases. Among them, ZnO is an interesting material
due to its excellent chemical stability and electronic structure8 and has good sensitivity to formaldehyde at elevated
temperatures.9 However, the formaldehyde
gas sensing properties of pure ZnO are poor around room temperature.10 Formaldehyde detection at low working temperatures
would be desirable for its efficient real-time detection.

Recently,
owing to the large specific surface area and superb electronic
properties, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is used as the modification
material for sensing applications.11 So
far, many rGO-based gas sensors have been reported for the efficient
detection of various volatile organic compounds.12 For example, Lee et al. synthesized ZnO–rGO composites
by a thermal annealing process and the gas sensitivity of the ZnO–rGO
gas sensors to NO2 was as high as 47.4% when the ZnO/rGO
mass ratio was 0.08. The improved gas sensing mechanisms were attributed
to the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups, the supply
of electrons from the oxygen vacancies of ZnO material, and the formation
of C–O–Zn bonds.13 Rong et
al. prepared a series of SnO2/rGO nanocomposites with various
rGO mass fractions and found that the sample with 0.5% rGO mass fraction
had the highest response to HCHO vapors between 100 and 160 °C.14 The enhanced formaldehyde-sensing performance
is attributed to the high surface area of the nanocomposite and the
suitable electron transfer channels of the rGO. Pan et al. synthesized
rGO–Cu2O nanocomposites by a facile solution-based
self-assembly method.15 The rGO/Cu2O composite with 1 wt % rGO exhibited excellent selectivity,
rapid response and recovery time, and 2.8 times higher response than
that of the pristine Cu2O, all of this at room temperature.
The enhanced sensing behavior was attributed to the incorporation
of rGO, which increased the gas adsorption active sites and allowed
the fast transport of carriers. Thus, decorating MOSs with rGO seems
to be an effective method for enhancing gas sensing properties.

To further improve the sensing performance of the rGO–MOS,
chemical doping or compositing with a third phase was also carried
out by many researchers. For instance, Bhati et al. synthesized Ni-doped
ZnO sensors decorated with 0.75 wt % rGO by the radio frequency sputtering
method. The sensor showed the maximum sensing response of ∼63.8%
for 100 ppm hydrogen at 150 °C, and the sensor was able to detect
hydrogen concentrations as low as 1 ppm.16 Esfandiar et al. fabricated hydrogen sensors based on Pd–WO3–rGO sheets that were fabricated by a hydrothermal
process, and the sensor was sensitive to 20 ppm concentration of H2 gas even at room temperature. The enhanced gas sensing performance
was attributed to the effect of residual oxygen-containing functional
groups of rGO and the morphology of metal oxide/graphene-based hybrid
nanostructures.17 Wang et al. reported
SnO2 nanoparticle-embedded, nitrogen-doped rGO (SnO2/N-rGO) hybrids by a hydrothermal method, and the incorporation
of N atoms into the SnO2/rGO hybrids significantly enhanced
the NO2 sensing performance at room temperature, in comparison
to SnO2/rGO hybrids.18 Although
rGO–MOS nanocomposites for the application as gas sensors are
numerous, additional doping of this nanocomposite to further improve
the gas sensing performance is rarely reported.

In the natural
world, Fe is one of the most common elements. Fe
ion radius and valence are different from those of Zn ion; when Fe is doped into
the ZnO matrix, the lattice distortion happens easily and also a large
number of crystal defects are produced;19 hence, Fe is chosen as the doping element in this study.

Herein,
we report a one-pot hydrothermal process to prepare the
Fe-doped ZnO/rGO nanocomposites. According to the structural and morphological
characterizations, Fe-doped ZnO/rGO nanocomposites were successfully
prepared. Compared to those of the pristine ZnO and ZnO/rGO nanocomposites,
the 5 atom % Fe-doped ZnO/rGO nanocomposites presented a largely enhanced
gas response and a fast response and recovery rate toward formaldehyde
at low temperature below 150 °C, implying that the Fe-doped ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites could be used for low-temperature gas sensing applications.
Based on the above results, the gas sensing mechanism was also discussed
in detail. The enhanced gas sensing performance of the Fe-doped ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites could be attributed to the large specific surface area,
the formation of p–n heterojunction, and more oxygen vacancies.

2 Experimental Details
2.1 Preparation of Sensing
Materials
The graphene oxide (GO) synthesis procedure was
the following: 1
g of graphite powder and 3 g of KMnO4 were added into 25
mL of concentrated H2SO4 in a flask under vigorous
stirring at 0 °C. Next, 50 mL of distilled water was mixed into
the suspension and the temperature was increased to 100 °C, where
it was kept for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 mL
of distilled water and 10 mL of 30% H2O2 solution.
Finally, the products were filtrated and washed with 5% HCl, then
with ethanol for 5 times, and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12
h.

The 5 atom % Fe-doped ZnO/rGO nanocomposites (simply expressed
as 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO) were prepared via a hydrothermal method.
First, 0.02 g of GO was dispersed into 20 mL of ethanol and sonicated
for 2 h in an ultrasonic bath to obtain uniform GO dispersion. Zinc
acetate (2 mM), ferric trichloride (0.1 mM), and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
(0.2 g) were dissolved in distilled water (20 mL) under magnetic stirring
to form a homogeneous white milky solution. Then, the GO solution
was introduced into the above solution and stirred for 60 min to form
a uniform mixture, transferred into a 50 mL autoclave, and heated
at 160 °C for 12 h. Finally, the precipitates were washed and
dried in air at 60 °C for 10 h. Meanwhile, 2.5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO,
7.5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO, ZnO/rGO, and pure ZnO samples were also
synthesized using the identical procedure with adding different Ferric
trichloride ratios or GO for comparison.

2.2 Characterization
of the Materials
A Rigaku D/Max-1200X diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation was
applied for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus spectrometer. The
Raman spectra were measured by a Renishaw In Via spectrometer at 532
nm wavelength. Hitachi S-4300 SEM and JEOL TEM-2010F were used to
observe the surface morphology of the samples. The specific surface
area was measured on a surface area analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP
2020M) using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model.
The UV–vis spectra were obtained by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan). The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was operated by using an Al Kα X-ray (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation source (Thermo ESCALAB 250)
to investigate the surface chemical compositions and states. The electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at 25 °C on
a Bruker ER-200D EPR spectrometer.

2.3 Gas Sensor
Fabrication and Measurement
The gas sensing performance of
the sample was tested by a CGS-1TP
gas sensor testing system (Beijing Elite Tech. Co. Ltd). The Al2O3 substrate (8 × 15 × 1.5 mm3) with Ag–Pd interdigitated electrodes was used to prepare
the film sensor (Figure S1a). First, the
as-synthesized products were ground and mixed with distilled water,
then pasted onto the Ag–Pd interdigitated electrodes to form
a thick sensing film of ∼1 mm, and dried at 60 °C for
5 h to ensure that the sensing film was smooth and free of bubbles
and cracks (Figure S1b). The operating
temperature was controlled by the heating system, and the relative
humidity (RH) was set based on the needs of the experiment. The target
gas was filled into the test chamber through the injection pore, and
the fans for gas diffusion were turned on. When the gas response reached
a constant value, the test chamber was purged with the fresh air and
the fans were turned off. The filling and purging times of the test
chamber were about 1 and 2 s, respectively, which were not calculated
in the response and recovery times. Here, the gas response is defined
as S = Ra/Rg, and the response and recovery times are defined as
the total resistance change time (from 0 to 90 %) of the sensor on contact with the
target gas and fresh air. The detailed operation procedures of the
gas sensing testing process are described elsewhere.20

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterizations of the Sensing Materials
The XRD
patterns of GO, rGO, ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples are displayed in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1a, the XRD spectra of GO show a distinct diffraction
peak at 2θ of around 11.6°, which is the typical peak for
GO,21 indicating the successful oxidation
of graphite powders. After reduced in the hydrothermal process for
GO, the diffraction peak between 24 and 30° is attributed to
the (002) plane of rGO.21 In Figure 1b, the diffraction peaks of
ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples are all corresponding
to the (101), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (120), and
(201) diffractions of ZnO (P63mc, JCPDS 36-1451), but all of the characteristic peaks
of GO and rGO disappeared in the ZnO/rGO and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples. Based on the above results, no obvious rGO diffraction peaks
appear in the XRD patterns of ZnO/rGO and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples, which may probably be ascribed to the small content of rGO.
In addition, from the inset of Figure 1b, the position of the (002) diffraction peak of 5
atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO is shifted slightly to high diffraction angle
compared to that of pure ZnO and ZnO/rGO, which reveals the change
in lattice parameters. The change in lattice parameters can be attributed
to the ionic radius of Zn2+ (0.74 Å), which is significantly
larger than the ionic radius of Fe3+ (0.645 Å). Based
on the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO are calculated to be 51.9, 50.1, and 39.9
nm, respectively. The results indicated that adding rGO did not change
the crystallite sizes of ZnO and that rGO nanosheets were simply absorbed
on the surface of the ZnO. Base on the above XRD results, Fe3+ ions were successfully incorporated into the ZnO lattice and reduced
the crystallite sizes of ZnO.

Figure 1 (a) XRD spectra of GO and rGO samples. (b) XRD
spectra of ZnO,
ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples; the inset show the
(002) diffraction peaks of ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples.

Figure 2 presents
the Raman spectra of GO, rGO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples. All of the samples show the strong characteristic peaks located
at 1350 and 1582 cm–1 corresponding to D and G bands,
which are the typical graphene characteristic peaks.22 The intensity ratios of D to G bands (ID/IG) of the rGO, ZnO/rGO,
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposites are 1.121, 1.126, 1.158,
respectively, higher than that of GO (0.981), which can be attributed
to the partial modification of surface oxygen-containing functional
groups. The Raman results indicated that the reduction of GO was successful
after the hydrothermal treatment.23

Figure 2 Raman spectra
of GO, rGO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples.

The FTIR spectroscopy is used
to analyze the chemical bond structures
of the GO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples. In Figure S2, the FTIR spectrum of GO illustrates
several distinct strong peaks related to oxygen functional groups
at 1242 cm–1 (C–OH), 1618 cm–1 (C–O–C), 1752 cm–1 (C=O),
and 3455 cm–1 (OH).24 However, after hydrothermal treatment, all of the adsorption peaks
of oxygen functional groups in ZnO/rGO and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples become weaker or even disappear, which indicates that the
rGO can be successfully produced by the hydrothermal method. Notably,
the new peaks of the Zn–O bond appear in only ZnO/rGO and 5
atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO at around 518–632 cm–1; the Zn–O symmetrical stretching vibration indicates the
dispersion of ZnO on the rGO nanosheets.25 However, the C=C adsorption peaks in ZnO/rGO and 5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO samples get a blueshift, which ascribes to the ZnO
interacting with the rGO plane.26

Figure S3a shows the XPS spectra of
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO products, which clearly confirms the existence
of Fe, Zn, O, and C elements in the products. Figure S3b shows that the Fe 2p signal; the Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peaks are located at 710.2 and 724.1 eV,
respectively. However, a weak peak is located at 717.7 eV corresponding
to γ-Fe2O3,27 which indicates that Fe3+ is successfully incorporated
into the ZnO lattice. In Figure S3c, the
complex C 1s XPS spectra can be divided into four oxygen-containing
functional groups peaks, corresponding to O–C=C, C–O–C/C=O,
C–O, and C–C/C=C groups of rGO, which are located
at 289.1, 286.3, 284.9, and 284.6 eV, respectively.28 In Figure S3d, the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks are centered at 1044.8 and
1021.8 eV, respectively. From Figure S3e, the O 1s XPS peak is divided into three OL (oxygen lattice),
OV (oxygen vacancy), OC (chemisorbed oxygen)
characteristic peaks by the Gaussian method, which are centered at
531.6, 532.9, and 533.4 eV, respectively.29

Figure 3 presents
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the ZnO, ZnO/rGO,
and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples. Figure 3a–c depicts the SEM images of the
pure ZnO at different magnifications. A large number of ZnO hexagonal
prisms with good dispersity and uniform sizes can be observed in Figure 3a. The field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of Figure 3b,c, show that the hexagonal prism exhibits
a smooth surface without any attachments. The SEM images of ZnO/rGO
nanocomposites are shown in Figure 3d–f; the sizes of nanocomposites are not uniform
as those of pure ZnO (Figure 3d), and the surface of the ZnO hexagonal prism becomes coarse
and or even broken. Notably, from the FESEM images of Figure 3e,f, some thin rGO nanosheets
covering the surface of ZnO hexagonal prisms can be observed. The
SEM images of 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO are displayed in Figure 3g–i, and it
can be seen that the morphology and size of ZnO hexagonal prisms apparently
change after doping with a certain amount of Fe, as the sides of the
ZnO hexagonal prisms are fastigiate just like been intercepted (Figure 3g), and the subface
of the ZnO hexagonal prism becomes coarse and loose. Moreover, from
the FESEM images of Figure 3h,i, it is visible that some intervals and pores are also
formed inside the ZnO hexagonal prisms and some thin rGO nanosheets
are also attached on the surface of the ZnO hexagonal prisms. As a
result, the size and morphology of the ZnO hexagonal prisms are changed
by adding rGO and doping with Fe.

Figure 3 SEM and FESEM image of (a–c) ZnO
samples, (d–f) ZnO/rGO
samples, and (g–i) 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples.

Figure S4a–e shows the results
of the element mapping for the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO hexagonal
prisms, confirming the presence of C, Fe, O, Zn elements. It can be
seen that the Fe elements distribute uniformly in the ZnO hexagonal
prisms and the C elements are mainly distributed around the ZnO hexagonal
prisms, which are consistent with the XPS and SEM results. Figure S4h exhibits the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposites,
and the rGO nanosheets attached on the surface of the ZnO hexagonal
prisms can be clearly identified. The TEM image of partial rGO nanosheet
is almost transparent, indicating that the rGO nanosheet is very thin.
The SAED pattern of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposite is
shown in the inset of Figure S4h, which
reveals the polycrystalline structure of the as-prepared 5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposite.

Figure S5 shows the BET surface area
results and the pore distribution of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sample. The type IV physisorption isotherms and type H3 hysteresis
loops reflect the existence of mesopores and slitlike pores in the
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sample (Figure S5a).30 Moreover, Figure S5b shows that the pore size distributes from 5 to 80 nm and
some open mesopores (∼10.9 nm) indwell in the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sample. The BET surface area and pore volume data of ZnO, ZnO/rGO,
and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO are (16.5 m2/g, 0.039 cm3/g), (35.9 m2/g, 0.055 cm3/g), and (48.2
m2/g, 0.061 cm3/g), respectively. The 5 atom
% Fe–ZnO/rGO sample exhibits the largest BET and pore volume.
As far as we know, ZnO is a surface-controlled-type sensing material,
so the increased BET and pore size can provide highly increased gas
sensing reaction sites for the target gas molecules, resulting in
the largely improved gas sensing performance.

3.2 Gas Sensing
Properties
The optimum
working temperature is of great importance for the gas sensor. Therefore,
the gas response of the sensors based on ZnO, ZnO/rGO, 2.5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO, 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO, and 7.5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples to 5 ppm formaldehyde were measured as a function of working
temperature. Figure 4 shows the gas response of the sensors to 5 ppm formaldehyde at a
different temperature from 20 to 270 °C. Interestingly, all of
the sensors exhibit the maximum gas response at the optimum working
temperature. The tested maximum gas response and optimum working temperature
were Smax = 3.6 at 220 °C (ZnO), Smax = 8.2 at 120 °C (ZnO/rGO), Smax = 10.3 at 120 °C (2.5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO), Smax = 12.7 at 120 °C (5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO), and Smax = 7.6 at 120 °C (7.5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO),
respectively. Notably, the sensor based on 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
exhibits the highest gas response to formaldehyde, which is almost
4 times higher than that of the pure ZnO. Meanwhile, the optimum working
temperature of 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor has been dropped
to about 100 °C compared to that of the pure ZnO sensor. On the
other hand, the sensors based on the Fe-doped ZnO/rGO and ZnO/rGO
exhibit a gas response signal even at room temperature (20 °C),
but there is no gas response signal for the sensor based on pure ZnO
at this temperature. From the above results, one can conclude that
adding rGO can reduce the operating temperature and improve the gas
response of ZnO. Moreover, doping Fe can further enhance the gas response
for the ZnO/rGO composites and the optimum doping amount of Fe is
5 atom %. Therefore, the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sample was chosen
to investigate the gas sensing performance in details.

Figure 4 Gas responses of the
sensors based on ZnO, ZnO/rGO, 2.5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO, 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO, and 7.5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples vs operating temperatures to 5 ppm formaldehyde.

Since gas selectivity is a significant reference
designator for
the application of gas sensor, the gas responses of ZnO, ZnO/rGO,
and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensors to 5 ppm to six typical indoor
pollutant gases were measured at every sensor’s optimum working
temperature (220 °C for ZnO and 120 °C for ZnO/rGO and 5
atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples). Figure S6 shows the column diagram of the gas responses of three sensors to
six typical indoor harmful volatile gases, including carbon monoxide
(CO), benzene (C6H6), acetone (CH3COCH3), formaldehyde (HCHO), methylbenzene (C7H8), and ammonia (NH3). From the column diagram,
the ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensors all exhibit
preferable selectivity toward formaldehyde. Notably, the 5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor possesses the maximum gas response ratio
value, where the gas response ratio is defined as Sformaldehyde/Sother target gases. The gas response ratio of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor
is between 2.5 and 11.5, whereas the gas response ratio of the pure
ZnO is only between 1.4 and 5.1. Usually, ammonia is considered as
a much stronger reducing gas compared to formaldehyde,31 but our sensor exhibits a higher gas response
to formaldehyde than ammonia. As far as we know, in the gas sensing
testing process, NH3 may be more likely to bond with water
molecules as NH3·H2O and combines with
ZnO to form [Zn(H2O)m(NH3)n]2+ complexes further,32 where m = 2, 3, 4, 6 and n = 0, 1, 2, 3, which consumed a mass of NH3 and
hindered the gas sensing reactions, resulting in the lower gas response
of ammonia. Based on the above experimental results, the 5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor exhibits good selectivity to formaldehyde.

Figure 5a–c
shows the gas response of the ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensors to 1–5 ppm formaldehyde at their optimum working temperatures.
The gas response curves of three sensors exhibit a continuing upward
trend with the rise of formaldehyde concentration, but the gas response
of 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO is apparently higher than that of pure
ZnO and ZnO/rGO to any one of the formaldehyde concentrations. Figure 5d displays the single
response–recovery characteristic of the three sensors based
on ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO to 5 ppm formaldehyde.
The response and recovery times are evaluated to be 51 and 26 s for
the ZnO sensor, 41 and 31 s for the ZnO/rGO sensor, and 34 and 37
s for 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor, respectively. Interestingly,
the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor exhibits a faster response time,
but a longer recovery time than that of the other two sensors. The
reason can be ascribed to the large specific surface area and plentiful
pores of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor, which is beneficial
for the gas diffusion and sensing reactions (e.g., high gas response
and quick response time) but adverse to the gas desorption because
of the long, flexible distribution of the cavities or pores in the
materials (e.g., long recovery time).

Figure 5 (a–c) Real-time response and recovery
curves of the sensors
based on ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO to 1–5
ppm formaldehyde at their optimum temperatures and (d) response and
recovery times of the sensors based on ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO to 5 ppm formaldehyde at their optimum temperatures.

The effect of the relative humidity
on the behavior of the sensor
based on 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO to different formaldehyde concentrations
was investigated with four different humidity conditions, dry, 20,
40, and 60% relative humidity (RH). As shown in Figure S7a–d, the gas response of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensor decreased rapidly as the RH increased. On the other hand, the
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor exhibited a relatively stable and
fast response–recovery time from the dry condition to 40% RH;
however, at high humidity (60% RH), the response–recovery time
became suddenly longer. In high RH conditions, the water vapor is
absorbed on the rGO and ZnO surfaces, restricting the absorption of
oxygen ions (O– or O2–) and blocking
the surface to adsorb formaldehyde molecules. Therefore, the gas response
of the Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor to formaldehyde was reduced and the
response–recovery time was also prolonged. In general, the
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor exhibited the deteriorative gas
sensing properties with the increasing humidity.

To meet the
practical application for the detection of formaldehyde,
the gas sensing properties of the sensor based on 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
were tested comprehensively at 120 °C and 20% RH. Figure S8a shows the gas responses of the 5 atom
% Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor to formaldehyde gas at different concentrations.
The gas response value of our sensor exhibits a quickly increasing
trend as the formaldehyde concentration achieves 45 ppm, then presents
a period of slowly increasing trend as the formaldehyde concentration
is further increasing, and finally reaches a saturation gas response
value of ∼81.8 at 70 ppm formaldehyde concentration. Notably,
the gas response of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor is increased
almost linearly from 0.1 to 1 ppm formaldehyde concentration (see
the inset of Figure S8a). The linear dynamic
range is investigated from 0.1 to 1 ppm, which exhibits ∼4.667
about the slope (Δ(Ra/Rg)/Δ(concentration))
of the linear curve. The theoretical limit of detection of the 5 atom
% Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor to formaldehyde is calculated to be ∼19
ppb (signal-to-noise ratio > 3).33

The long-term stability of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor
was also investigated, and the sensing measurements were tested at
1, 5, and 10 ppm formaldehyde for 6 weeks, as shown in Figure S8b. Throughout the three cyclic tests,
the gas responses changed slightly 9.1, 8.3, and 7.1% to 1, 5, and
10 ppm formaldehyde gas, indicated that the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensor even had a good stability in low concentrations of formaldehyde,
and the gas response of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor was
more stable at high formaldehyde concentrations. In Table 1, the gas sensing performance
to formaldehyde is compared between the fabricated 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensor and the previously reported ZnO- or rGO-based sensors.34−43 Our sensor presented excellent overall gas sensing properties (i.e.,
a working temperature at 120 °C and a gas response of 12.7) to
5 ppm formaldehyde, whereas most of the other formaldehyde sensors
exhibited a working temperature above 150 °C and their gas responses
were detected in formaldehyde concentrations above 100 ppm. Based
on these results, the sensor based on 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO should
have the potential development and application for the trace detection
of the formaldehyde gas.

3.4 Gas Sensing Mechanism
The separation
efficiency of electron–hole can be analyzed by photoluminescence
(PL) spectra. As shown in Figure S9a, PL
spectra of the ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples
exhibit similar emission peaks; the peaks at 397 and 423 nm for UV
emission originate from the recombination of free excitons, and the
enhanced peak at 476 nm for green emission is ascribed to the recombination
of an electron to a photoexcited hole.44Figure S9b shows that the intensity of
the green emission peak is significantly weakened as the rGO is added
to the ZnO/rGO and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples, which is due
to the excellent conductivity of rGO, similar to the Mott–Schottky
effect.45 Moreover, the rGO exhibits high
carrier mobility and detectable resistance change for the adsorption
or desorption of formaldehyde at room temperature due to superior
electrical properties, which contribute to the lower working temperature
of the ZnO/rGO composite than that of pure ZnO. This means adding
rGO improved the electronic transfer efficiency and conductivity of
the ZnO/rGO nanocomposite, thereby further decreasing the working
temperature, and enhanced the gas sensing performance of the ZnO-based
gas sensor.

The band gaps of the ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom %
Fe–ZnO/rGO samples were studied by UV–vis spectroscopy. Figure 6a shows that all
of the samples exhibit strong adsorption at ∼400 nm in the
UV region. Notably, the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sample exhibits
an apparent redshift and extends its absorption area from UV to UV–vis,
which means a new dopant energy level may be formed below the conduction
band (CB) of ZnO. As far as we know, ZnO is a direct-band semiconductor;
the relationship among the absorption coefficient (α), band
gap (Eg), and photon energy (hν) is αhν = C(hν – Eg)1/2.46 By extrapolating the
(hν)–(αhν)2 plot to (αhν)2 =
0, Figure 6a can be
transformed into Figure 6b. From Figure 6b,
the Eg values for ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5
atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO are 3.51, 3.49, 3.23eV, respectively. It
can be seen that rGO has almost no effect for the change of ZnO band
gap, whereas Fe doping reduced the band gap of ZnO apparently.

absorbance and reflectance spectra for ZnO, ZnO/rGO,
and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO samples. (b) (αhν)2 versus hν curves of the
UV–vis spectra of ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples.

In Figure 7a, the
valence band (VB) levels of ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
are determined by VB XPS. The VB positions of ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5
atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO were 2.32, 2.32, and 2.84 eV, indicating
that Fe doping resulted in the upshift for the VB position of ZnO.
According to the band gap and VB position, we can calculate the conduction
band (CB) positions of the ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples and the energy band diagram of the samples can be drawn. As
shown in Figure 7b,
adding rGO had no influence on the ZnO energy band structure, but
doping with Fe adjusted the forbidden band position and moved up the
CB and VB positions (the descending amplitude of CB was higher than
that of VB). As a result, the band gap of ZnO was narrowed; therefore,
the electrons can be released more easily from CB to VB in ZnO by
thermal excitation.47 The apparent upshift
of the CB level was a benefit to generate more electrons, which would
combine with surface-absorbed O2 to form more absorbed
oxygen ions (O2– and O22–) and ultimately improved the gas sensing performance
of the ZnO sensor by Fe doping.

samples.

Based on the XRD results, the
doped Fe ions substituted for Zn
ions in the ZnO matrix, whereas the appropriate oxygen vacancies (VO••) would be produced due to different valences and ionic radii48 1  Here, FeZn is the Fe
substitution
in Zn sites, OO× is the lattice oxygen, and VO•• is the oxygen vacancy. Since
the VO•• center easily traps an electron to form a singly ionized VO•, which
causes EPR signal, EPR spectra can be used to evidence VO•• in the samples.49 As shown in Figure 8, a weak characteristic
EPR signal of substitutional Fe3+ with a g value of 2.09 was detected for 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO,50 whereas no signal was observed for the ZnO and
ZnO/rGO samples. On the other hand, ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
samples exhibited an EPR signal with a g value of
1.999, which rooted from the singly ionized oxygen vacancies (VO•).51 It can be seen from Figure 8 that ZnO and ZnO/rGO exhibited the same
intensity of the EPR signal for VO•; these oxygen vacancies were produced
in the crystallization process of ZnO. Notably, 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
exhibits the strongest EPR signal, which means that introducing Fe
into ZnO nanocomposites significantly increased the number of oxygen
vacancies. As far as we know, VO•• often acts as an adsorption
and a reaction site to form plentiful O2– and O22–, respectively.52 Hence, Fe doping provided a large number of
gas adsorption sites and could trap electrons from ZnO easily, therefore
increasing the electron depletion layer of the ZnO composites. The
relative resistance change was dramatic when the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensor was exposed to air and formaldehyde, which enhanced the gas
sensing performance remarkably.

Figure 8 EPR spectra for ZnO, ZnO/rGO, and 5 atom
% Fe–ZnO/rGO samples.

The as-prepared 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposites
consist
of rGO nanosheets and Fe-doped ZnO spheres, where the rGO nanosheet
is adsorbed tightly on the surface of the Fe-doped ZnO sphere (Figure 9a). When the ZnO
sensor was exposed to air at a certain working temperature, the surface-absorbed
oxygen ions (O–, O2–) were produced
by trapping electrons from the CB of ZnO.

5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposite. (b) Possible gas sensing
reaction and electron transfer in air. (c) Possible gas sensing reaction
and electron transfer in formaldehyde vapors.

As the working temperature increased, more surface-absorbed
oxygen
ions were produced and an enlarged electron depletion layer was formed.
This process reduced the carrier concentration, and the ZnO sensor
material exhibited a high-resistance state, as shown in Figure 9b.

When the ZnO sensor
was exposed to formaldehyde, the formaldehyde
gas molecules reacted with the adsorbed oxygen ions 2   3   4  Therefore, the trapped electrons by the absorbed
oxygen were released back into the CB of ZnO, which decreased the
electron depletion layer, resulting in a low-resistance state, as
shown in Figure 9c.

Figure S10 shows the resistance change
curves of the sensors based on rGO and ZnO exposed in air and 5 ppm
formaldehyde at 120 °C. It can be observed from Figure S10 that the rGO exhibits a typical p-type resistance
curve, whereas the ZnO exhibits a typical n-type resistance curve.
Bhati et al. also reported that rGO often exhibits the p-type semiconductor
property with the work function of ∼4.75 eV and ZnO is an n-type
semiconductor with the work function of ∼4.3 eV.16 Based on the above results, the proposed enhanced
gas sensing mechanism is shown in Figure 9. When ZnO/rGO composites were produced in
the hydrothermal process, the p–n heterojunctions could be
formed at the interface of ZnO/rGO composites (Figure 9a).53,54 It is known that the
majority charge carriers are holes in p-type rGO, whereas the majority
charge carriers are electrons in n-type ZnO.55,56 Due to the lower work function of ZnO and the superconductive property
of rGO, the holes are transferred from rGO to ZnO and electron conduction
will take place from n-ZnO to p-rGO at the interface between ZnO and
rGO.57 Hence, when the ZnO/rGO composites
were heated to a certain temperature, the thermionic electrons in
the CB of ZnO would transfer from ZnO to rGO in the p–n heterojunctions,
which accelerated the carrier (electrons and holes) separation efficiency
in ZnO. In another aspect, rGO often presents a zero band gap, like
a metallic junction,58 and the Fermi level
of rGO is more positive than the CB position of ZnO, so the thermionic
electrons transfer from ZnO to rGO is a low-energy consumption process,
which would decrease the working temperature for the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensor. In the electron transfer process, a thick depletion layer
was formed in p–n heterojunctions, which can be enlarged further
as the working temperature kept going on; meanwhile, the resistance
of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor increased drastically. After
the electronic transmission achieved a dynamic balance, band bending
occurred at the ZnO/rGO heterojunctions and the resistance of the
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor reached a maximum value (i.e., increasing
the electron depletion layer) (Figure 9b). When the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor was
exposed to formaldehyde, the adsorbed oxygen ions reacted with formaldehyde
and the trapped electrons flew back into the CB of ZnO, which decreased
the electron depletion layer, and finally the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensor arrived at the lowest resistance value (Figure 9c). This gas sensing reaction process resulted
in the sharp resistance change of the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO sensor,
which improved the gas sensing performance to formaldehyde significantly.
On the other hand, the Fe doping adjusted the forbidden band position
and the band gap of ZnO was narrowed. Meanwhile, Fe doping produced
abundant oxygen vacancies in the ZnO host, which acted as gas adsorption
or reaction sites to form plentiful absorbed oxygen ions (O2– and O22–), and the
gas sensing performance toward formaldehyde was further enhanced.
Moreover, adding rGO and doping Fe also decreased the size of ZnO
hexagonal prisms; therefore, the surface area and pore size of the
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposite were increased effectively,
which provided much more gas sensing reaction sites for the target
gas molecules, resulting in the largely improved gas sensing performance.
Hence, doping Fe and decorating with rGO nanosheets have the synergistic
effect to enhance the gas sensing properties of ZnO.

4 Conclusions
Fe-doped ZnO/rGO nanocomposites were successfully
fabricated by
a one-pot hydrothermal process. Adding rGO and doping with Fe decreased
the size of ZnO hexagonal prisms and increased the surface area of
the ZnO nanocomposites. Compared with the bare ZnO and ZnO/rGO, the
5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO nanocomposites presented a largely improved
gas sensing performance at relatively low temperature toward formaldehyde.
The sensor based on 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO exhibits gas response
of 12.7–5
ppm formaldehyde at 120 °C, response and recovery times as short
as 34 and 37 s, respectively, and good stability and selectivity,
but the sensor also shows degenerative gas sensing performance above
40% RH. Based on the gas sensing performance for the 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO
sensor, the gas sensing mechanism was also proposed in detail, the
largely improved gas sensing properties could be attributed to the
large specific surface area, the rGO-ZnO heterojunction, the narrowed
band gap, and plentiful oxygen vacancies. It appears that the sensor
based on 5 atom % Fe–ZnO/rGO has the potential development
and application for the trace detection of the formaldehyde gas.
