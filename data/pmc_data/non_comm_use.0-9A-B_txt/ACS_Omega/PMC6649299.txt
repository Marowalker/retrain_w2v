Liposomes are attractive vehicles
for localized delivery of antibiotics.
There exists, however, a gap in knowledge when it comes to achieving
high liposomal loading efficiencies for antibiotics. To address this
issue, we investigated three antibiotics of clinical relevance against
staphylococcal infections with different hydrophilicity and chemical
structure, namely, vancomycin hydrochloride, teicoplanin, and rifampin.
We categorized the suitability of different encapsulation techniques
on the basis of encapsulation efficiency, lipid requirement (important
for avoiding lipid toxicity), and mass yield (percentage of mass retained
during the preparation process). The moderately hydrophobic (teicoplanin)
and highly hydrophobic (rifampin) antibiotics varied significantly
in their encapsulation load (max 23.4 and 15.5%, respectively) and
mass yield (max 74.1 and 71.8%, respectively), favoring techniques
that maximized partition between the aqueous core and the lipid bilayer
or those that produce oligolamellar vesicles, whereas vancomycin hydrochloride,
a highly hydrophilic molecule, showed little preference to any of
the protocols. In addition, we report significant bias introduced
by the choice of analytical method adopted to quantify the encapsulation
efficiency (underestimation of up to 24% or overestimation by up to
57.9% for vancomycin and underestimation of up to 61.1% for rifampin)
and further propose ultrafiltration and bursting by methanol as the
method with minimal bias for quantification of encapsulation efficiency
in liposomes. The knowledge generated in this work provides critical
insight into the more practical, albeit less investigated, aspects
of designing vesicles for localized antibiotic delivery and can be
extended to other nanovehicles that may suffer from the same biases
in analytical protocols.

Introduction
Localized delivery
of antibiotics is a promising tactic to treat
challenging infections, such as biofilms (a major challenge with indwelling
medical devices) and intracellular infections (such as Salmonellosis).1,2 In fact, some of the most seemingly resistant infections can be
eradicated if a higher dose of antibiotics could be delivered to the
site of infection. Delivering such high loads via the usual routes
of administration is challenging because antibiotics are significantly
diluted by the time they reach the site of infection, requiring administration
of higher doses that can be dangerously toxic or even deadly.3

Liposomes are widely used vehicles for
drug delivery, owing to
their proven biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to encapsulate
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds.4,5 Liposomes
are vesicles in which an aqueous volume (which can encapsulate hydrophilic
compounds) is enclosed by a spherical lipid bilayer (which can encapsulate
hydrophobic compounds) typically composed of phospholipids and additional
agents like cholesterol.6 The liposomal
lipid bilayer interacts directly with the lipids comprising the cell/bacteria
membrane, thus delivering the cargo directly to the cell membrane
without having to rely on active or passive uptake of the nanovehicle
by target bacterial cells;7 this makes
liposomes specifically advantageous for the localized delivery of
high loads of potentially toxic agents that cannot be administered
systemically.

Liposomes can be tailored, to a certain degree,
to the specific
cargo and release conditions by choosing specific phospholipids and/or
technique used for their preparations. The cargo is typically loaded
during the preparation step, resulting in the encapsulation load being
strongly affected by the preparation process. The optimal choice of
liposome preparation/cargo encapsulation technique depends on the
physicochemical characteristics of the material to be encapsulated,
the desired size and polydispersity of the vesicles, the desired bilayer
properties, and the ease of upscaling the process.8 Multiple techniques for liposome preparation/cargo encapsulation
have been reported in the literature. The preparation/encapsulation
techniques can be classified into three major categories: mechanical
dispersion, solvent dispersion and detergent removal. These techniques
have four main steps in common:6,9 (i) drying the lipids
from organic solvents, (iii) dispersing the lipid in aqueous media,
(iii) resizing the liposomes, and (iv) purifying/cleaning the liposome
suspension. The final step is crucial for most real-life applications
as well as for quality control purposes and for accurate determination
of encapsulation load.

Multiple reports of antibiotic encapsulation
in liposomes have
been published using various lipids.10−17 A review of the literature on liposomal encapsulation of antibiotics,
however, can cause confusion and, in some cases, even shows inconsistencies.
A clear example of one of these inconsistencies is the encapsulation
of the antistaphylococcal antibiotic rifampin. A group reported 0%
encapsulation efficiency using the thin film (TF) method with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and cholesterol,18 whereas Manconi et al. reported encapsulation
efficiency of 74% with a slightly modified thin-film technique and
using a very similar lipid.19 We hypothesize
that these inconsistencies in the literature (most of which we also
observed in our lab) are suggestive of a chronic bias in both preparation/encapsulation
techniques and the analytical techniques adopted for characterization,
partially fueled by the lack of technique development focused on antibiotics.
Antibiotics are a chemically different class of molecules from cancer
drugs, but the liposomal encapsulation and characterization techniques
that have been developed for cancer drugs are also being used by most
researchers for antibiotic encapsulation, leading to biased data in
the open literature. Antibiotics have a different molecular weight,
chemical structure, and dissociation constant (pKa) than antitumor drugs.20 In
fact, for antibiotics, very few pKa values
are currently available.21 This gap in
knowledge has resulted in bias when it comes to developing both synthesis
and analytical techniques for encapsulation of antibiotics.

We set out to explore the extent of reach for the hypothesized
biases by evaluating three of the more common preparation techniques,
shown in Figure 1,
for three different antistaphylococcal antibiotics with significantly
different hydrophobicity: vancomycin hydrochloride, teicoplanin, and
rifampin. We used three widely used liposome preparation techniques
and evaluated each technique based on the encapsulation efficiency
for each antibiotic, lipid usage (important for avoiding lipid toxicity),
and antibiotic mass yield (or mass loss during the process), as well
as the final liposome size and ζ potential. To decrease scatter,
we used the same lipid for all methods and antibiotics. We further
developed a technique for quantifying the encapsulation efficiency
with minimal bias to address the significant bias observed in techniques
reported in the literature for analyzing liposomal antibiotic encapsulation.

Figure 1 Overview
of liposome preparation techniques. (a) Thin-film hydration
method that consisted of creating a thin film of lipids that was challenged
by a solution of water and antibiotic at a temperature above the transition
temperature of the lipid so that multilamellar liposomes can be formed.
(b) Freezing and thawing method shares the same three initial steps
as in part (a), but after stirring, was exposed to three cycles of
freezing at −196 °C and thawing at either room temperature
(RT) with sonication or above the transition temperature of the lipid
without sonication. (c) Reverse phase refers to the fact that the
method creates micelles by sonicating a mixture of an organic phase
and an aqueous phase. Once the organic solvent is evaporated, the
micelles implode and transform into liposomes.

Results and Discussion
Liposomal Preparation Technique Impact on
Encapsulation Efficiency
and Mass Yield
Liposomes encapsulating vancomycin hydrochloride,
teicoplanin, and rifampin were prepared using the three methods (thin
film; freezing, annealing, and thawing (FAT); and reverse-phase evaporation
(REV)), as shown in Figure 1. Liposome encapsulation efficiency and mass yield during
the process of creating the liposomes were then quantified. All liposomes
from this section were prepared using an antibiotic concentration
corresponding to 18% of vancomycin’s solubility limit in water
and 80% of teicoplanin’s and rifampicin’s solubility
in water and the lipid was added in a 1:3 ratio of cholesterol/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC).

As shown in Figure 2, mass yield (percentage
of mass retained during the preparation process) varied significantly
for each antibiotic depending on the preparation technique. For vancomycin
hydrochloride (water solubility 50 mg/mL), FAT retains more mass (93.4
± 7%) whereas REV results in up to 57% mass loss (Figure 2a). For the highly lipophilic
antibiotic rifampin (water solubility 1.3 mg/mL, highly lipid soluble22), however, FAT resulted in a mass yield of 44.4
± 9%, TF showed less than 10% mass remaining, and REV proved
to be the most efficient method, resulting in 79.5 ± 3% mass
yield (Figure 2b).

bars) and mass yield (blue markers) for lipsomes loaded with (a) vancomycin
hydrochloride, (b) rifampin, and (c) teicoplanin. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.005.

For the moderately lipophilic antibiotic, teicoplanin (water
solubility
10 mg/mL), FAT resulted in a mass yield of 32.6 ± 9.2% and TF
showed less than 50% remaining mass but REV proved to be the most
efficient method, resulting in 93.4 ± 3.42% mass retained (Figure 2c).

The low
mass yield for rifampin and teicoplanin in TF and FAT methods
can be attributed to the “rehydration” step, in which
the solution needs to be heated to the lipids melting temperature, Tm (42 °C for DPPC) until the thin film
is completely rehydrated for TF and mostly rehydrated for FAT. This
step can take a long time (up to 40 min) resulting in partial evaporation
of the aqueous volume; since we used rifampin and teicoplanin solutions
at 80% their solubility in water (1.3 and 10 mg/mL, respectively),
evaporation of a fraction of water resulted in precipitation of rifampin
or teicoplanin, further decreasing the loading efficiency. Vancomycin
hydrochloride, which is highly soluble in water, is not affected in
terms of mass yield by this evaporation step, because the concentration
we used is 18% of its solubility limit in water, resulting in FAT
being the most efficient method for vancomycin. REV, which was highly
inefficient in terms of mass yield for vancomycin, proved the most
efficient for rifampin. In REV, the aqueous solution with diethyl
ether does not fully create a homogeneous dispersion after sonication,
probably because vancomycin is practically insoluble in diethyl ether;
this is not the case for rifampin, which is equally soluble in water
and in diethyl ether.

FAT method, which was very efficient in
terms of mass yield for
vancomycin hydrochloride, also resulted in a 33.4 ± 3% encapsulation
efficiency (Figure 2a). This can be explained by the large aqueous space inside this
type of liposomes. It has been reported that repeated cycles of freezing
and thawing in the FAT technique disrupt the bilayer due to the formation
of ice crystals during the freezing step, disrupting the closely spaced
lamellae of the multilamellar liposomes vesicles and increasing the
aqueous volume.23 A 10–50×
increase in the internal volume of liposomes after freezing and thawing
has been reported as a result of the fusion of small vesicles to form
bigger liposomes.24 Additionally, extrusion
of FAT liposomes reduces the lamellarity of the liposomes because
the disrupted vesicles reassemble into unilamellar vesicles, increasing
the internal aqueous volume.6,25 It is noteworthy that
we conducted theoretical calculation of the aqueous volume for liposomes
(model modified from Xu et al.)26 with
the size distribution of our liposomes, which predicts an encapsulation
efficiency of 33.72% (calculation given in the Supporting Information), close to that achieved using FAT.
It is noteworthy that the adopted theoretical model does not account
for the chemistry of lipids, presence of cholesterol, or the interaction
of lipid with the antibiotic. It should also be noted that even though
REV resulted in a higher encapsulation efficiency (39.4%) for vancomycin,
its mass yield was less than 50%, making it a nonoptimal method.

In the case of rifampin and teicoplanin, REV method showed the
highest encapsulation efficiency, 82.7 ± 0.8 and 84.1 ±
8.3%, respectively (Figure 2b,c). REV liposomes are known for producing a high internal
aqueous volume and oligolamellar vesicles.27 For a drug that can only be loaded in an aqueous space such as vancomycin,
a system that produces oligolamellar vesicles is not optimal, but
for a drug that can be loaded in the aqueous space as well as the
bilayer, the production of unilamellar and oligolamellar vesicles
enhances the encapsulation efficiency. This method could, in theory,
encapsulate hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic compounds, because
it creates oligolamellar vesicles with large aqueous volumes. However,
our results show that it is clearly more advantageous for the moderately
and highly hydrophobic antibiotics like teicoplanin and rifampin.

TF technique (introduced by Banghman et al.)28 is known to produce multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) of multiple
sizes (reducing aqueous space); therefore, it is necessary to use
size reduction techniques, such as sonication or extrusion.29,30 This method is believed to be suitable for hydrophobic compounds.
Previous reports of rifampin-loaded liposomes (prepared with soy lecithin
with a lecithin/cholesterol ratio of 60:40 v/v) created via TF have
reported encapsulation efficiencies that range from 53.3 to 79.25%,
depending on the composition.17,19,31 However, our results show that the TF method may not be the best
option for hydrophobic antibiotics. Our TF-rifampin liposomes had
an encapsulation efficiency of 50.33%. Even though the encapsulation
efficiency was not low, the amount of rifampin mass loss during the
process was remarkably high (>88% in our experiments); thus, we
recommend
encapsulating rifampin with the REV method. The case for teicoplanin
is similar; its encapsulation efficiency using TF was 63 ± 11.34%,
a considerably high encapsulation efficiency, comparable with REV;
however, its mass loss was significant with an yield of less than
50%.

The hydrodynamic diameter for vancomycin liposomes did
not show
a significant variation between the different preparation methods
(Figure 3a). All liposomes
were extruded through a 400 nm membrane; all liposomes are expected
to be smaller than 400 nm (representative size distribution presented
in Figures S1 and S2). The ζ potential
(in 1 mM KCl) for vancomycin liposomes was very close to neutral for
all preparations (as expected on the basis of the charge of DPPC)32 with REV leading to a slightly more negative
ζ potential. The change in ζ potential for REV vancomycin
liposomes could be due to the presence of two types of liposomes created
by REV methods (namely, multilamellar vesicles, MLVs, and large unilamellar
vesicles, LUVs) promoting repulsion between the vesicles.

size (black bars) and charge (blue markers) are shown
in (a) vancomycin hydrochloride, (b) rifampin, and (c) teicoplanin.
* P < 0.05; ** P < 0.005.

However, for rifampin, FAT and
TF produced significantly bigger
liposomes than REV (Figure 3b). Rifampin, being lipophilic, is likely intercalating in
the bilayer for FAT and FT liposomes. REV liposomes with rifampin
do not allow for this effect, because multiple bilayers are created
and the internal space of the unilamellar vesicles is large. In the
case of rifampin, positive ζ potential was observed for FAT
and REV and close to neutral ζ potential was observed for REV.
The change in ζ potential, from neutral and to positive for
FAT and TF liposomes with rifampin, may also be explained by the antibiotic
being exposed in the bilayer.9

Teicoplanin
liposomes (Figure 3c) were smaller than the other two antibiotic liposomes.
TF liposomes were smaller than 50 nm, this size would significantly
reduce the inner aqueous volume space, leading to a low encapsulation
efficiency of highly hydrophilic compounds. However, since teicoplanin
is both moderately hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic and TF produces
multilamellar liposomes, it could have been encapsulated in the multiple
bilayers not needing a large aqueous internal space. This may explain
why TF-teicoplanin liposome encapsulation efficiency was relatively
high (63.03 ± 11.34%). Additionally, teicoplanin encapsulation
in the bilayer could explain the relatively high negative ζ
potentials, −20.8 ± 3.5 and −18.28 ± 8.6,
obtained with the methods REV and TF, respectively, methods that promote
oligolamellar or multilamellar vesicles. This high ζ potential
does not happen in FAT liposomes, possibly because the aqueous space
is responsible for most of the encapsulation.

Solubility Limit of Antibiotics
Affects Encapsulation Efficiency
and Mass Yield
Concluding from the previous section that
FAT is the most efficient method for encapsulation of vancomycin and
REV is the most efficient method for encapsulation of rifampin and
teicoplanin, we prepared FAT-vancomycin liposomes, with different
vancomycin concentrations, corresponding to 8, 18, and 25% of vancomycin
solubility limit in water, REV-rifampin liposomes with concentrations
corresponding to 80, 100, and 120% of rifampin solubility limit in
water, and REV-teicoplanin liposomes with concentrations corresponding
to 50, 80, and 100% solubility in water. The mass of lipid used was
kept constant; thus, the different antibiotic concentrations can also
be interpreted as different antibiotic-to-lipid ratios.

As shown
in Figure 4, changing
the amount of vancomycin hydrochloride or teicoplanin used for the
preparation of liposomes did not result in a significant change in
terms of encapsulation efficiency, mass yield, size, or charge (Figures 4a,c and 5a,c). However, for rifampin, changes in the mass
of rifampin used during liposome preparation result in small but statistically
significant differences between encapsulation efficiency, they also
significantly influence the mass retained, with the largest mass retention
achieved at 80% of the rifampicin solubility limit in water (Figures 4b and 5b). This may be explained by the partial evaporation of water
in the REV method, leading to precipitation of the antibiotic. It
is noteworthy that if the only criterion for evaluating the efficiency
of a chosen method/concentration was encapsulation efficiency, for
the case of rifampin, FAT and TF methods could be considered equally
plausible. However, the addition of the mass loss during the process
as an additional criterion for quality control provides extra information
that allows us to determine that FAT is a better method than FT. The
same happens when evaluating solubility in which, thanks to the mass
retained criteria, we can conclude that a concentration of 80% of
the solubility limit is the best choice for rifampin encapsulation.

Method Bias in Liposome Cleaning Methods
While performing
experiments with different preparation techniques, we observed drastic
inconsistencies in results obtained for encapsulation efficiency depending
on the chosen method for cleaning the liposome preparations. Ultimately,
the encapsulation efficiency is calculated as the percentage of the
antibiotic that is inside liposomes when compared with the total amount
of antibiotic present; therefore, the total amount of antibiotic in
the system as well as the free antibiotic need to be determined. Pinpointing
a possible method bias at this stage is critical for ensuring proper
quality control.

Various methods have been reported for separating
encapsulated and free antibiotic; three of the most popular methods
are centrifugation,11 ultrafiltration,33 and dialysis shown in Figure 6. In addition, multiple methods can be adopted
for releasing the antibiotic encapsulated in the liposomes for the
purpose of quantifying the total amount of antibiotics; two of the
most popular methods are the use of Triton and methanol to disrupt
the lipid bilayer. We focused on the two extremes in hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
for this section, namely, vancomycin hydrochloride and rifampin. All
liposomes reported in this section were prepared using FAT, 18% solubility
limit (for vancomycin encapsulation) and REV, 80% solubility limit
(for rifampin encapsulation).

Figure 6 (a) Ultrafiltration method used to separate
free and encapsulated
drug: (1) the sample with the freshly made liposomes is added to the
ultrafiltration tube and then (2) centrifuged; the free drug will
pass through the membrane, whereas the liposomes will stay on top;
(3) to recover the liposomes, the filtration tube can be flipped upside
down and centrifuged again. (b) Centrifugation to separate the free
and encapsulated drug; in this method, the liposomes are expected
to be spun down and form a pellet after a round of centrifugation
at high speed and the drug will stay in the liquid at the top. (c)
Dialysis: (1) adding the liposomes to dialysis membranes with a cutoff
smaller than the liposomes but bigger than the drug so that the drug
can pass the membrane. (2, 3) The system was subjected to shaking
and samples were taken at specific time points to measure the quantity
of the drug that has been released. (4) At the end of the process,
the liposomes will have liberated all of their content.

We first analyzed the ability of Triton and methanol
to disrupt
the vesicles by quantifying how much drug was maintained in the system
using the optimal formulations obtained in the previous section. Even
though this method could be biased if the samples do not retain 100%
of the mass, the comparison between the two methods is still valid.
Triton disrupted 77 ± 8.5% of vancomycin liposomes and only 53.31
± 5.8% of rifampin liposomes (Figure 7a), whereas methanol disrupted the vesicles
more efficiently, with 92.4 ± 7% of the vancomycin liposomes
and 94 ± 1.73% of the rifampin liposomes disrupted (Figure 7b). Triton X has
been commonly used to disrupt the liposomes since it changes the phospholipid
organization, forming highly asymmetrical structures,34 thus allowing for leakage of the encapsulated antibiotic.
Addition of methanol is believed to alter the planar membrane structure
and increases the activation energy required for fusion, possibly
due to an increase in membrane fluidity.35 We observed that methanol outperformed Triton X at disrupting the
membrane; however, Triton may still be the preferred option for in
vitro evaluation of antibiotic-loaded liposomes toward bacteria because,
unlike methanol, it does not represent major toxicity toward bacterial
cells.36

Figure 7 Liposome disruption with (a) Triton and
(b) methanol. The percentage
of disruption was obtained by measuring the amount of initial antibiotic
existent in the system. Efficiency of separation of liposomes form
unencapsulated antibiotic using (c) ultrafiltration and (d) centrifugation.
The percentage of liposomes in the free antibiotic phase (ideally
zero) is represented in gray, whereas the percentage of liposomes
in the separated liposome layer is shown in white. For (c), after
centrifugation for 2 h at 30k relative centrifugal force (RCF), the
pellet and the supernatant were separated and quantified with dynamic
light scattering (DLS) to determine the amount of vesicles in dilution
in each phase. For (d), the samples were ultrafiltered at 10k RCF
for 10 min using Amicon filters before quantification.

In addition, we quantified the efficiency of ultrafiltration
and
centrifugation for separating the liposomes from the unencapsulated
antibiotic. Ultrafiltration effectively separated the antibiotic from
the liposomes, with no liposomes detected in the free antibiotic phase,
and close to 100% (95 ± 9% for vancomycin and 97 ± 4% for
rifampin) of the liposomes were retained in the liposome layer (Figure 7c). Centrifugation,
however, although widely employed, was not as effective, with liposomes
detected in the separated antibiotic phase (Figure 7d). For vancomycin, only 45.4 ± 12%
of the initial liposomes were retained in the liposome layer and 72
± 21% stayed in the free antibiotic phase. For rifampin, 105.52
± 6.5% of the initial liposomes were found in the liposomal phase
and 57.31 ± 1.4% were left in the free antibiotic phase. The
fact that these numbers do not add up to 100% indicates a clear method
bias and suggests that centrifugation is probably disrupting the liposomes
and breaking them into smaller vesicles. It may be argued that increasing
the centrifugation speed may increase the separation effectiveness;
however, increased speed significantly increases liposome disruption
and is thus not feasible for separating free antibiotic from liposomes.
The observation that centrifugation does not effectively separate
the free antibiotics from liposomes suggests that numbers reported
for encapsulation efficiency, obtained using centrifugation as the
cleaning/separation method, may be significantly skewed. As shown
in Figure 7, when centrifugation
was used as a cleaning method, the calculated encapsulation efficiency
was very high for vancomycin (91%). For rifampin, however, the outcome
was very different. Centrifugation lead to a calculated encapsulation
efficiency of 45% and Triton (which does not fully burst the liposomes)
led to a calculated encapsulation efficiency of 15%, both much lower
than that calculated when ultrafiltration was used. A similar study
conducted in 1987 showed that ultrafiltration outperformed centrifugation,
airfuge, and dialysis at separating free and encapsulated antibiotics;37 unfortunately, a review of the literature shows
that centrifugation remains a common practice for separation of free
and encapsulated antibiotics.

The final method that we used
to calculate encapsulation efficiency
was through dialysis. This method also separates unencapsulated drug
from encapsulated drug by filtering the content through a membrane.
The results obtained are similar to the encapsulation efficiency numbers
calculated with methanol + ultrafiltration. The calculated efficiency
for vancomycin was 41 ± 5% whereas for rifampin it was 63.7 ±
11%. That is why this is a popular method in the literature; however,
there are two limitations that are worth mentioning: (1) the criteria
for determining the time point in which all unencapsulated drug has
been released is subjective, and (2) it is a lengthy method (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Encapsulation efficiency
calculated using different separation
techniques (ultrafiltration or centrifugation) and different total
release methods (methanol and Triton, dialysis).

An additional bias is introduced in values calculated for
encapsulation
efficiency in the process of analyzing the experimental results. There
are two major methods adopted in the literature to calculate the encapsulation
efficiency: (1) in terms of the ratio of cargo found inside the vesicles
to the amount of cargo that was initially added to the preparation
flask or (2) in terms of the ratio of cargo found inside the vesicles
to the total antibiotic (encapsulated and unencapsulated) in the system
after the preparation of the vesicles. Both methods represent a measure
of the encapsulation efficiency; the former represents the combined
effect of efficacy of drug encapsulation and possible mass loss during
the process, whereas the latter (which is the method that we adopted)
represents the absolute capacity of the preparation method to encapsulate
the cargo; we analyzed mass yield separately. This lack of consistency
in analysis means that the values reported in the literature span
a wide range for very similar systems and are sometimes even contradictory.
It is therefore important to adopt a standard method for reporting
encapsulation efficiency in liposomes and other nanodrug delivery
vehicles. We propose decoupling encapsulation efficiency (partitioning
of drug inside and outside the liposomes) from mass lost during liposome
preparation, by calculating encapsulation efficiency in terms of the
total drug present in the liposome preparation (and not the amount
added at the beginning), and report mass yield separately. Otherwise,
it will not be clear if a low encapsulation efficiency is the result
of mass lost during an unsuitable preparation method or other factors
(e.g. lipid chemistry) for encapsulating a specific cargo.

Liposomal
Antibiotic Release Profile
As a final assessment
of the optimal liposome composition for antibiotics, we prepared liposomes
with vancomycin or rifampin using the optimal preparation method and
compositions determined in the previous sections, with the addition
of various concentrations of cholesterol, namely, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1,
DPPC/cholesterol (molar ratio). Cholesterol has long been added to
liposomal preparations to decrease leaking of the lipid bilayer and
allow for sustained release. Cholesterol works by inducing conformational
ordering of the lipid chains.38 The release
profiles for vancomycin hydrochloride and rifampin are presented in Figure 9. For vancomycin,
the total content of the drug was released in 13 days, as shown in Figure 9a, whereas for rifampin
it was released in 7 days, as shown in Figure 9b. Adding more cholesterol showed lower release,
increasing the release time for both vancomycin and rifampin. Interestingly,
the concentration of cholesterol influences the release rate for the
samples containing 2:1 DPPC/cholesterol for the case of vancomycin.
This was not the case for rifampin in which the increasing cholesterol
did not result in a significant difference in release. This could
have two possible reasons: (1) rifampin randomly intercalates in the
bilayer making the release random or (2) rifampin liposomes, due to
the fact that they were created using REV, are more polydisperse in
size; thus, its release profile has more variability.

Figure 9 Release profile of vancomycin
(a) and rifampin (b) with liposomes
created with different ratios of cholesterol. (Inset) the first 3
days of release profile for vancomycin-loaded liposomes.

Vancomycin liposomes show burst release; in the
first 4 h, they
release almost 50% of the content, which is close to the quantity
of the drug that was previously identified as not being encapsulated;
FAT-vancomycin encapsulation efficacy (EE) = 39.1 ± 3%. The same
case happens with rifampin: in 4 h, it releases 23%, and in our previous
experiments, it was shown that rifampin encapsulates 82.6 ± 0.8%
so the released drug for the first 4 h is most probably the unencapsulated
drug, presenting dialysis as a good but time-consuming alternative
to cleaning liposomes. After the cleaning stage, vancomycin burst
released 55% of the remaining drug in the next 12 h, after which it
constantly released 6.26 μg/h for 12 days. After the cleaning
stage, rifampin showed an almost linear release (R2 = 0.98) for 48 h with a constant release of 27.4 μg/h
and then it plateaued. Vancomycin took considerably more time than
rifampin to release the entire content of the liposomes; this could
be due to the fact that vancomycin is allocated in the aqueous core
whereas rifampin intercalates in the bilayer making it more readily
available. Optimizing the antibiotic release rate is of interest for
antibiotics. For example, rifampin is used in antituberculosis therapy.
Due to various systemic side effects, its treatment involves prolonged
oral administration of high systemic doses over a period of 4–10
months.19 Thus, a delivery system that
can release the antibiotic for a prolonged period in high dosages
without affecting other organs would be highly desirable.

Conclusions
Liposomes are attractive vehicles for delivering antibiotics because
they can be made of physiologically compatible lipids that can interact
with the bacterial cell membrane, delivering the drug via direct interaction,
and can be designed to maintain sustained release. Although liposome
preparation methods have been thoroughly studied and optimized for
maximal encapsulation of cancer drugs, antibiotics are a different
class of compounds that require further method development for efficient
liposomal encapsulation. Our investigation highlights the importance
of the methods of preparation of the liposomes and its impact on the
encapsulation of antibiotics, with different methods leading to optimal
results for hydrophilic versus hydrophobic antibiotics. Methods leading
to multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) are preferred for antibiotics that
are highly hydrophobic, and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) are
preferred for hydrophilic antibiotics. In addition, we highlight that
significant bias can be introduced into quantification of antibiotic
encapsulation efficacy through (i) liposome disruption and cleaning
methods and (ii) analysis of results, by not accounting for mass loss
of antibiotics during the preparation process. Regardless of the preparation
and cleaning methods adopted, we strongly recommend evaluating/reporting
mass yield as a criterion for evaluating the suitability of antibiotic
encapsulation methods. In summary, our results point to the importance
of evaluating the methods for nanoencapsulation of antibiotics and
being mindful of potential biases in methods and analysis.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Lipids
The lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (16:0 PC DPPC) (99%, Avanti,
MilliporeSigma) was used for all experiments. The antibiotics vancomycin
hydrochloride (pharmaceutical grade secondary standard), rifampin
(≥97%), and teicoplanin (≥80%), as well as Triton X-100
were also obtained from MilliporeSigma. Cholesterol (95%) was obtained
from Fischer Scientific. The remaining chemicals (methanol ≥99.9%,
diethyl ether, and KCl) were obtained from VWR.

Thin Film (TF)
Method
The liposomes were prepared with
a modified thin film method, as reported by Meers et al.2 Briefly, DPPC (10 mg) and cholesterol (1.75 mg)
were dissolved in chloroform (1 mL) inside a round bottom flask and
evaporated using a Hei-VAP rotary evaporator (Heidolph) at 35 °C.
The lipid film was then left overnight in a vacuum desiccator to eliminate
traces of chloroform. The film was subsequently rehydrated with Milli-Q
water with resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm (at 25 °C) containing
the corresponding antibiotic (teicoplanin, vancomycin hydrochloride,
or rifampin) at 42 °C. The lipid vesicles were then extruded,
55–101×, using an Avanti mini extruder at 42 °C using
a 0.4 nm pore size membrane.

Reverse-Phase Evaporation (REV) Method
The modified
reverse-phase liposomes were utilized as reported by Halwani et al.41 Briefly, previously indicated amounts of DPPC
and cholesterol were diluted in chloroform in a round bottom flask
and a thin film was formed using a rotary evaporator to evaporate
the solvent. Diethyl ether (3 mL) and Millipore water (1 mL) were
added next. Vancomycin hydrochloride was added to the aqueous phase
whereas teicoplanin and rifampin were added to the organic phase.
The mixture was then sonicated for 35–40 min at a temperature
below 10 °C until one phase or a homogeneous dispersion was obtained.
Finally, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure at room temperature
using a rotary evaporator for 40 min. The formation of bubbles was
avoided by increasing the pressure upon spotting visual signs of bubble
or foam formation. The liposome suspension was extruded as described
above.

Freezing, Annealing, and Thawing (FAT) Method
Vesicles
were prepared by the thin film method, as described above, but before
the extrusion step, three freeze–thaw cycles were added. A
single freeze–thaw cycle consisted of freezing the vesicles
for 5 min at −196 °C using liquid nitrogen and thawing
them inside a VWR bath sonicator (35 kHz, 90 W) at room temperature
for 5 min. The samples were stored at 4 °C for 30 min after the
three cycles of freezing and thawing, before annealing at room temperature
for 30 min and extruding, as described above.

Determination of Size and
Charge
Liposomes, prepared
with each method, were resuspended in 1 mM KCl and diluted 50×
before size and ζ potential measurements. Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) was used to evaluate the hydrodynamic diameter of liposomes
using the Malvern Instruments Zetasizer NanoZSP. All DLS runs were
repeated three times on each sample. Malvern Instruments Zetasizer
Nano-ZSP was also used for ζ potential measurements using a
capillary cell. The ζ potential runs were repeated three times
for each sample with noninvasive backscatter optics and analyzed with
Smoluchowski’s model.39

Quantification
of Encapsulation Efficiency and Mass Yield
Encapsulation
efficiency was calculated as the percentage difference
between the total antibiotic (encapsulated and nonencapsulated) and
the free antibiotic (nonencapsulated). Three methods were used to
quantify the total antibiotic: (1) Methanol (0.5%) was added to the
liposome suspension. After incubating the sample for 50 min at 4 °C,
five parts Millipore water was added to the system and the suspension
was then analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-micro-time-of-flight
(TOF) to quantify the antibiotic. (2) The lipid membranes were disrupted
with 2% Triton X-100. (3) Liposome suspensions (0.5 mL) were subjected
to dialysis using the Slide-A-Lyzer 20k molecular-weight cutoff (MWCO)
dialysis inserts, and the total antibiotic release was quantified
by measuring absorption using the BioTek Synergy Neo plate reader
at a wavelength of 280 nm for vancomycin and 470 nm for rifampin.
The absorbance reads were converted to concentration using a calibration
curve, prepared for each antibiotic. Mass yield was determined as
the ratio of total antibiotic, as determined in this step, to the
initial mass of antibiotic added to the system during the preparation
stage.

To determine the amount of free antibiotic, three methods
were used: (1) Liposomes were ultrafiltrated (Amicon Ultra centrifugal
filters, MWCO 30k) for 10 min at 10 000g.
(2) Liposomes were centrifuged at 20 000g for
3 h. (3) Liposome suspensions (0.5 mL) were subjected to dialysis
using the Slide-A-Lyzer 20k MWCO dialysis inserts, and nonencapsulated
antibiotic was measured after 2 and 4 h. After separating the free
antibiotic from the liposomes, the free antibiotic was analyzed using
HPLC-micro-TOF. The percentage encapsulation efficiency was calculated
after measuring free antibiotic and total antibiotic with the following
equation: .

Liposome Quantification
and Quantification of Disruption
The scattered light produced
by a colloidal suspension can be measured
as the photons per second detected by a detector; when the size of
the nanoparticles is close and the attenuator is fixed, this number
can be related to concentration.40 The
quantity of liposomes present in each liposomal formulation was estimated
by using the photons per second of each formulation with the Malvern
Zetasizer NanoZSP. Then, after the liposomes were separated from the
free antibiotic, either by ultrafiltration or centrifugation, the
quantity of liposomes in each phase was determined using the Zetaziser.
After the liposomes were burst with either methanol or Triton, the
samples were analyzed via HPLC-micro-TOF to determine the amount of
free antibiotic; an increase in the amount of antibiotic indicated
more disruption, whereas less antibiotic indicated that some liposomes
were not fully releasing their content.

High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) and Time-of-Flight
Mass Spectrometry (TOF-MS)
For all HPLC measurements, Agilent
1200 series HPLC with a Bruker micrOTOF-II mass spectrometer was used
with the Agilent XDB-C18 analytical column (100 mm × 2.1 mm,
3.5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of two solvents: eluent
A: aqueous formic acid (0.1% v/v); eluent B: acetonitrile containing
0.1% formic acid (0.1% v/v).

For vancomycin and teicoplanin,
the column temperature was 40 °C with the injection volume of
10 μL. For vancomycin, the run time was 21 min with a flow rate
of 0.3 mL/min and a gradient elution program as follows: 97% mobile
phase A for 3 min; linear increase to 30% B over 7 min, hold for 2
min; afterward, a linear increase up to 80% mobile phase B within
1 min, hold for 2 min; return to the initial condition within 1 min;
and re-equilibration for 5 min. For teicoplanin, the run time was
6.5 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The gradient elution program
was as follows: 97% mobile phase A was introduced from the initial
sample injection hold for 1 min, then switched to 97% mobile phase
B over 1 min, then returned to initial conditions within half a min
and re-equilibration for 3 min.

For rifampin, the column temperature
was 25 °C and the injection
volume was 10 μL. The run time was 12 min at a flow rate of
0.4 mL/min with a gradient elution program as follows: 65% mobile
phase A, held for 1 min, increased to 90% solvent B over 4 min, then
increased to 95% solvent B, held for 3 min, returned to initial conditions
and re-equilibration for 4 min.

Quantification was achieved
by TOF-MS positive-ion electrospray
ionization. Ion detection was performed at m/z 724.7 for vancomycin hydrochloride, at m/z: 939.7, 940.7, 947.8, and 782.4 for teicoplanin
components, and m/z 823.4 for rifampin.
For teicoplanin quantification, the determination of the area under
the curve was obtained as the sum of the four major compounds.
