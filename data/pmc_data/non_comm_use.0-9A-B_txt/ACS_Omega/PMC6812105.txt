In
the present study, we report an efficient method for tetracycline
(TC) removal from contaminated wastewater using alginate beads, immobilized
with bio nanocomposite (BNC) consisting of Fe3O4 (iron oxide) and TiO2 (titanium dioxide) nanoparticles
along with dead biomass of TC-resistant bacteria Acinetobacter sp. Chemically synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles
and commercially available TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles
were combined to form nanocomposite followed by encapsulation within
alginate beads along with heat-killed biomass of Acinetobactersp. for the efficient degradation and adsorption of the target pollutant.
The primary characterization of chemically synthesized nanoparticles
was carried out with Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron
microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, transmission
electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. The batch studies
for TC removal were performed by varying the reaction parameters such
as bead weight, initial TC concentration, and pH in a photoreactor
with UV-C irradiation. TC concentration of 10 mg/L, bead weight 10
g, and pH 6 were fixed as the optimum condition where 98 ± 0.5%
of TC was removed from the solution. The possible removal mechanism
was investigated with the help of UV–visible, total organic
carbon, oxidation–reduction potential, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
and liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy analyses. The applicability
of the process was successfully tested with the natural water systems
spiked with TC at 10 mg/L. To assess the ecotoxic effects of the treated
effluents, the cell viability assay was performed with the algal strains, Chlorella, and Scenedesmussp. and the bacterial strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosaand Escherichia coli. Finally, the
reusability of the BNC bead was successfully established up to the
4th cycle.

1 Introduction
Widespread
usage of antibiotics in human and veterinary applications
has made natural water system rife with organic pollutants.1 The very first reported water contamination due
to antibiotic pollutants was reported in England by Watts et al.2 They identified a mixture of antibiotics like
tetracycline (TC), macrolides, and sulphonamides in natural water
system up to the concentration of 1 mg/L way higher than the permissible
limit.2 Minimal cost and ease of large-scale
production favors the wide use of TC in agricultural, human, and veterinary
applications.3 TC administration in humans
and animals, in turn, results in about 90% of its release into the
environment, especially the natural water systems in the active form.4 The presence of TC in the natural water system
brings in toxic effects to aquatic and human life and may lead to
antibiotic resistance in bacteria.5

Conventional methods of wastewater treatment make use of membrane
filtration, chemical reactors (photochemical, electrochemical, advanced
oxidation, ozonation, and photocatalytic process), and adsorbents
for the removal of various organic pollutants. Among these, the adsorption-based
antibiotic removal is profitable as it makes use of a simple separation
technique, cost-effective, easy to perform, and less toxic to the
environment.6,7

Adsorption of contaminants
only involves the transformation of
antibiotics from one phase to another without any degradation. Hence,
a suitable method is required for degrading the contaminants into
less harmful byproducts.9 A recent method,
the advanced oxidation process (AOP) involves the formation of hydroxyl
radicals which converts such antibiotics into harmless products under
UV irradiation with various nanoparticles like ZnO, TiO2, and H2O2.10

Nanoparticles are suitable for the oxidation process because of
their high photocatalytic activity, relatively stable in aqueous solution,
nontoxic nature, and low cost.11 It was
reported that TiO2/UV-A-based photocatalytic degradation
followed by adsorption of pharmaceutical compounds is more advantageous
over the conventional antibiotic removal techniques,12 as it involves fast mineralization and detoxification of
the antibiotic by photocatalytic ozonation.13 However, in spite of its advantages, TiO2-based antibiotic
removal has reduced photocatalytic effect because of the formation
of electron–hole recombination; hence, to prevent this effect,
Ti can be fortified with other metals especially with Fe3+. TiO2 was effectively doped with Fe3+ because
of its half-full electron configuration and relatively equal ionic
radius with Ti nanoparticles.14

Fe3+–TiO2/UV-C based photocatalytic
degradation removed 88.92% of amoxicillin from wastewater but it required
pretreatment methods for the enhanced removal in natural water samples11 and the nanophotocatalyst, Fe3+–TiO2 with UV-C radiation was used to remove up to 97% of metronidazole
from the aqueous system.15 Also, the occurrence
of penicillin-G was reduced to more than 90% with Fe3+–TiO2/UV-A photocatalytic treatment and this technique was reported
as the most efficient and cost-effective method for the removal of
the penicillin.14

Wastewater treatment
technique based on adsorption also relies
on biosorbents like bacteria, fungi, algae, yeasts, and agricultural
waste. The main attributes of biosorption include rapid adsorption
rate, high selectivity and efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Hence,
this method can be used as an efficient alternative to the existing
carbon-based adsorption techniques.16 β-Lactam
antibiotics like penicillin-G were effectively adsorbed by dried Rhizopus arrhizus and activated sludge. This material
can be used as an alternative for carbon nanomaterials because of
its low cost and increased selectivity toward antibiotics.17

In the current study, we used the dead
biomass of Acinetobactersp. isolated
from the TC-contaminated
site. Even though, there are several studies regarding the removal
of antibiotics by AOP, we did not find any specific report on coupling
distinct advantages of antibiotic-resistant bacterial biomass with
photocatalytic potential of nanomaterials to degrade the antibiotics.
Herein, we report a novel nanobiomaterial, that is, the fortified
titanium dioxide (TiO2) (P25) catalyst with
iron oxide NP and dead biomass immobilized over biodegradable polymer
sodium alginate with UV-C irradiation for TC removal from aqueous
solution. Bionanocomposite (BNC) preparation involves (a) the synthesis
of iron oxide by chemical precipitation, (b) followed by the preparation
of nanocomposite with synthetic TiO2 (P25),
and finally combining with the dead biomass of Acinetobacter sp. which has high selectivity toward TC antibiotic. The prepared
BNC was characterized and validated for the removal of TC from the
natural water system.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization Studies
Figure 1A shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticle,
where the average size of the iron oxide nanoparticle was found in
the range of 75–85 nm with a spherical structure. The surface
morphology of the BNC beads was found to be smooth and uniform before
interaction with TC and the average size of the bead was 500–600
μm (Figure 1B).
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analysis of the BNC bead
showed the presence of the Fe, Ti content with 1.60 and 1.35 wt %,
respectively (Table S2 Supporting Information). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the procured
TiO2 nanoparticle shows the particle diameter ranging from
50 to 200 nm with irregular shape19 (Figure 1C).

BNC bead, (C) TEM image of procured TiO2 (P25) nanoparticle, (D) FT-IR spectrum of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle.

The Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrum (Figure 1D) of Fe3O4 shows two intense peaks
at 539 and 665 cm–1 corresponding
to Fe–O stretching vibration20 and
the peak at 3609 cm–1 is assigned to OH bending
and 1520 cm–1 corresponds to C=C aromatic
vibration.21

2.2 Batch
Removal of TC
2.2.1 Effect of Bead Weight
The BNC beads
of different weight percentages (1, 5, and 10 g) were tested with
10 mg/L of TC solution. The anticipated increase in the amount of
bead weight enhances the removal efficiency. Therefore, the TC removal
increased to 98.61% by the application of 10 g of BNC beads at 30
min. The reduced dosage of the beads to that of the TC produced a
lower removal efficiency of 33.72 and 66.46% for 1 and 5 g, respectively
(Figure 2A). This indicates
that the increase of the bead weight is proportionate with an increase
in the efficiency of the TC removal.

by (A) effect of bead weight
1, 5 and 10 g loaded with BNC, (B) effect of pH 4, 6 and 9, (C) effect
of initial TC concentration 10, 20, and 40 mg/L.

2.2.2 Effect of pH
The tests were performed
by varying the pH at 4, 6, and 9 with 10 g of the BNC bead and 10
mg/L of TC. The data showed that at pH 9 the percentage of removal
was 40.2 ± 2.19 and at pH 4 51.34 ± 1.97, whereas at pH
6 optimal TC removal of 98.61 ± 1.07 was noted (Figure 2B).

2.2.3 Effect
of Initial TC Concentration
Further tests were performed
with increasing concentrations of TC
from 10 to 40 mg/L. This condition leads to a decrease in the removal
efficiency of the TC (Figure 2C). The highest removal efficiency of 98.61 ± 1.07% was
obtained at 10 mg/L, whereas for 20 and 40 mg/L the removal percentage
declined to 88.92 ± 1.04 and 48.93 ± 1.09, respectively,
showing a reduction in removal efficiency by increasing TC concentration.

TC removal efficiency in the current study is compared with similar
studies from literature in Table 1. The control study to determine the effect of individual
nanoparticle and the dead biomass was performed under the optimum
experimental conditions. The experimental data shows 12.74, 15.9,
16.63, and 19.12% of TC removal by alginate beads without loading,
beads loaded with dead biomass, beads with Fe3O4 alone, and beads with TiO2 nanoparticle alone, respectively
(Figure S1 Supporting Information). To
find out the effect of nonphoto-assisted removal, the control experiments
were performed without any irradiation keeping the remaining conditions
same and only 16.16% of TC removal was obtained (Figure S2 Supporting Information).

2.3 Kinetics of TC Removal
The results
from the kinetic study clearly showed that the mechanism followed
the pseudo first-order kinetics with the regression value of approximately
around 0.976 (Figure 3). The study suggests that the adsorption of the TC involves initial
degradation followed by adsorption on alginate beads.22

kinetic model with k1 = 0.044 and R1 = 0.976 (B) pseudo second-order kinetic model
with k2 = 0.762 and R2 = 0.909.

2.4 TC Removal
Mechanism
The SEM analysis
(Figure 4A) of the
BNC bead after the interaction showed rough surface morphology. It
can be deduced that because of the adsorption of TC onto the surface
of beads there is a change in surface morphology from smooth to rough.23

Figure 4 (A) SEM image of the alginate bead loaded with BNC before
and after
interaction (B) XRD analysis of the BNC bead before and after interaction
with TC (C) FTIR spectrum of before and BNC bead before and after
interaction with TC.

The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis of the BNC bead before interaction
showed intense peaks at (101) and (200) corresponding to the anatase
TiO2 nanoparticle,24 and the
peak at (300) denoting the highly pure magnetite Fe formation21 (Figure 4B). After the interaction with TC, the intensity of the crystalline
phase of both TiO2 and Fe–O reduced, which may be
attributed to the degradation of antibiotics by the nanoparticle.

The FT-IR data, after interaction, showed slight shift of peaks
observed at 2310.72, 651, and, 551 cm–1. This can
be due to adsorption of photocatalytically degraded TC through binding
with the nanoparticles in the composite, through the formation of
C–C, C–OH, and C–H rings23 (Figure 4C). The
possible surface adsorption of the antibiotic onto the BNC beads was
further confirmed by surface area and porosity analysis of the beads
before and after the interaction. From the analysis, it was noted
that before interaction the surface area was 1.51 m2/g
and after interaction, it reduced to 0.27 m2/g which confirmed
that because of surface adsorption the porosity of the BNC beads decreased.

The TC removal mechanism with respect to total organic carbon (TOC)
content in the sample is displayed in Figure 5A, which shows steady decrease in TOC content
along with decline in TC concentration. Absence of any degradation
and adsorption of TC throughout the control test was confirmed because
the TOC remained constant.25 However, after
the interaction the TOC content showed significant reduction proving
notable role played by adsorption during the reaction. The maximum
drop of TOC data was noted at 30 min corresponding to 98.61% removal.

Figure 5 (A) %
TC removal analysis by the TOC study (B) ORP measurement
(C) HR-LC–MS analysis of the BNC bead-treated TC sample.

To understand the role of a reducing agent in the
degradation of
antibiotic oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) analysis was
performed and the data are shown in Figure 5B. The ORP value at time t0 was 380 mV and at time t30 had ORP value reduced to 170 mV indicating the presence of strong
reducing environment during the interaction.

The liquid chromatography–mass
spectroscopy (LC–MS)
analysis of the reacted liquid sample in Figure 5C shows that the intensity of the initial
TC peak at 445 was reduced after 30 min of interaction with the BNC
bead. The formation of intermediate byproducts was confirmed by the
presence of peak at 172 and the peak at 130, which involves various
structural and functional group modifications such as epimerization,
dehydration, and dimethylation. The degraded byproducts can be easily
adsorbed over the beads after interaction.26

2.5 Reusability of BNC
The reusability
test in Figure 6A showed
that BNC beads used in the experiment were viable until 4 cycles for
the better removal of TC. Further, the stability of BNC beads and
control beads under UV irradiation was analyzed for the deformities
and it established stability of beads after continuous cycle of TC
removal. The removal efficiency of control beads decreased after the
4th cycle with 4.8 ± 0.5% and for BNC beads 59 ± 0.5% of
TC removal. This decrease in the adsorption capacity is probably due
to binding of the TC-degraded products onto the nanoparticles present
within the matrix of the BNC beads or because of the escape of the
nanoparticles from the agile surface of the BNC beads. No deformation
of the beads could be noted even after four cycles of interactions.

2.6 BNC for Real Water Sample Treatment
The
effect of BNC bead on the natural water system adulterated with
TC shows was 85.16 ± 0.4% of TC removal in tap water followed
by groundwater with 79.62 ± 1.6% removal and lake water of 71.90
± 0.2% removal Figure 6B. The percentage TC removal was reduced for the natural water
system because of the presence of colloidal particles that are present
in the water sources. Hence, it requires that the natural water system
be pretreated before the application of the BNC bead for the most
effective removal of TC.

2.7 Residual Toxicity of BNC
The toxicity
assessment in Figure 6C showed that the percent cell viability of the two strains of algal
species in the range of 98.075 ± 0.1 and 93.644 ± 0.2 for Chlorella and Scenedesmus sp. which states that the Scenedesmus obliquus is more sensitive to the BNC-treated TC sample compared to the Chlorella and which shows the percent cell viability
of 69.79 ± 0.2 and 62.74 ± 0.3 against TC control. As for
the bacterial strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli, the toxicity assessment
was performed, which shows the percent cell viability of 91.83 ±
0.2 and 90.67 ± 0.1 for treated TC sample and 61.53 ± 0.2
and 60.75 ± 0.2 for TC control.

3 Conclusions
Application of the BNC-loaded alginate bead for the TC removal
from the natural water system was proven with the removal percentage
of 71.09 ± 0.2 which further increased by pretreatment of the
real water sample to remove colloidal impurities. It was found that
BNC-loaded alginate bead-based photocatalytic removal of TC will release
considerably less toxic byproducts with increased reusability range
and it can be easily separated out after the process. Hence, this
method can be further modified for the removal of mixture of antibiotics
with less cost and higher efficiency.

4.2 Synthesis
of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
Synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles
by co-precipitation techniques
involves the reduction of iron(III) chloride (0.1 M FeCl3·6H2O dissolved in 40 mL of 99% ethanol) by 2.5 M
of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) solution. The synthesis steps
involve the dropwise addition of NaBH4 to FeCl3 ethanol solution with continuous stirring at 200 rpm. The nanoparticles
formed were separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol twice
followed by overnight drying in a hot air oven.18

4.3 Dead Biomass Preparation
Initial
isolation and purification of Acinetobacter sp. was performed followed by identification of strain with 16s
rRNA sequencing. The regeneration of the Acinetobacter sp. was performed by adding 100 μL in 250 mL of nutrient broth
(NB) medium (beef extract 0.5 g, yeast extract 1 g, peptone 2.5 g,
sodium chloride 2.5 g) followed by resuspension of abovementioned
culture of 400 μL in 1000 mL NB medium which was performed to
achieve a desired quantity of biomass. Dead biomass was prepared by
sterilizing the culture at 121 °C/15 psi and drying it in a vacuum
oven overnight at 59 °C.

4.4 Preparation
of BNC Bead
Nanocomposite
material was prepared by dissolving equal ratio of synthesized Fe3O4 and commercial TiO2 (1:1 ratio) nanoparticles,
followed by probe sonication of the abovementioned solution. Preparation
of BNC involves the addition of dead biomass (1:2 ratios) into the
abovementioned solution. The sample was subjected to sonication in
a water bath to get equally dispersed BNC. Prepared BNC was mixed
with 25 mL sodium alginate (7%) solution and added dropwise into 100
mL of 2% calcium chloride solution to obtain BNC-immobilized alginate
beads.

4.5 Characterization Techniques
The chemically
synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles and alginate-encapsulated BNC
were characterized by high-resolution scanning electron microscope
(FEI Quanta FEG 200) for the analysis of particle size, shape, and
morphology with a magnification of 12× to 100 000×.
EDX provided elemental composition via backscattered electron detection
system and FT-IR spectroscopy (IR Affinity-1, Shimadzu, Japan) was
employed for analyzing the functional groups. The crystalline nature
of the BNC bead (before and after interaction) was analyzed by XRD
(Bruker Advanced D8, Germany). TOC in the TC-treated samples was measured
by the TOC analyzer (Shimadzu) and digital potentiometer (model DP003
PICO, Chennai) was used to analyze the reducing agents present in
the TC–BNC interacted solution. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
was used to study the surface porosity of the BNC bead before and
after interaction. High-resolution-LC–MS (HR-LC–MS)
(1290 infinity UHPLC system, 6550 iFunnel Q-TOFs, Agilent Technologies,
USA) was used to detect the degraded products of TC after interaction
with nanoparticles.

4.6 Batch Study for TC Removal
TC stock
solution (100 mg/L) was prepared and stored in dark at −4 °C
well in advance to the work. From the stock solution 40, 20, and 10
mg/L concentration of TC was prepared, and 1, 5, and 10 g of BNC beads
was filtered out and interacted with TC for 30 min interval in the
UV photoreactor (Heber compact multiwavelength multilamp photoreactor
SW-MW-LW888) under UV-C conditions in borosilicate tubes. The degradation
of TC with respect to the control was noted by analyzing the absorbance
of the sample at 360 nm. The experiment was carried out in triplicates
for statistical purpose. The amount of TC that remained in the test
sample can be calculated using the regression equation deduced from
the calibration graph, and the percentage of TC removal can be calculated
using the equation 1   2  where Ai and Af are the initial and
final absorbance, m (g) is the mass of the sorbent,
and V (L) is the sample volume.

4.7 Kinetic Study
To understand the kinetics
of TC removal by the UV-assisted BNC bead, pseudo-first and second-order
kinetic models were used. The formula is as follows 3  where qt and qe are used to denote TC adsorbed
at time t and at equilibrium te; the rate constant of pseudo-first-order model (min–1) was denoted by k1, which was obtained
by plotting log(qe – qt) versus t. However,
the formula for the pseudo-second-order kinetics is as follows 4  where k2 is the
pseudo-second-order equilibrium rate constant and which was obtained
by plotting t/qt versus t.

4.8 Residual
Toxicity Analysis
The bacterial
strain and algal strain were used to study the toxicity of TC and
BNC bead-treated TC sample. The bacterial strains were cultured in
NB and the algal strains in BG-11 medium. Standard plate count assay
was used to analyze cell viability of TC and BNC bead-treated TC interacted
cell culture.8
