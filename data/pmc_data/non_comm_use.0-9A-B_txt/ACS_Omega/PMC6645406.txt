The
preparation of porous films (average size variation from 1
to 32 μm) of a 1:1 blend of chitosan with poly(EG-ran-PG) by the controlled evaporation of water from a 2 wt % aqueous
acetic acid solution is reported. Interestingly, the blend exhibited
porosity that could be tailored from 1 to 32 μm with the temperature
of preparation of the blend film. The powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier
transform infrared, and differential scanning calorimetry analyses
of the films suggested the formation of partially miscible blends.
Temperature-induced phase separation of the blend appears to be the
mechanism of pore formation. The tensile strength, cytotoxicity, and
biocompatibility of the blend films for the growth of mesenchymal stem cells were assessed vis-a-vis chitosan. The 1:1 blend film
was observed to lack cytotoxicity and was also viable for the growth
of mesenchymal stem cells. The tensile properties
of the 1:1 blend were superior to those of the chitosan film. The
simple preparation of porous, nontoxic, and biocompatible films could
find use as a scaffold in the growth of tissue, and especially bone
tissue, in wound dressing, and in filtration if a better control over
pore size is achieved.

Introduction
Among the polymeric
materials, two natural polymers, namely cellulose
and chitin, are of prime importance, being synthesized in nature to
the extent of 1012 and 1011 tons per annum,
respectively. Chitin is a linear random copolymer consisting almost
exclusively β-(1,4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glycopyranose
repeat units and a very small extent of β-(1,4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-β-d-glycopyranose repeat units. It is present in crustaceans (as
one of the components of the exoskeleton), insects, algae, fungi,
and yeast.1−3 Chitosan is obtained by the deacetylation of chitin
(by hot alkaline hydrolysis; the extent of deacetylation must be 50
or more mol %).1−3 Chitosan is biocompatible, biodegradable, nontoxic,
hemostatic, antibacterial, and antifungal. For these reasons, chitosan
and its blends find wide applications in agriculture, wastewater treatment,
food packaging, beverage industries, and as a possible pharmaceutical
excipient;4−13 and are ideally suited for the fabrication of biocompatible materials
for tissue engineering/scaffolding,14,15 antibacterial
activity,16 wound healing/care,17,18 although other biodegradable synthetic polymers such as poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) in combination with sodium alginate19 as well as poly-d,l-lactic acid–poly(ε-caprolactone)
blends20 have also been used.

The
processing of chitosan, in a manner similar to commodity plastics,
has not been accomplished to date. The major limitation of chitosan
is that it does not soften on heating and decomposes before melting.
It is also insoluble in common organic solvents, but dissolves in
acidic solutions (pH ≤ 6.5). In applications demanding specific
properties such as antibacterial activity, biocompatibility, etc.,
chitosan is used in small quantities. Chitosan powder is used as an
antibacterial additive to synthetic plastics, such as poly(lactic
acid) (PLA), PVA, poly(ethylene), and nylon, for use in food packaging
materials. For example, nylon-6 is endowed with antibacterial activity
upon blending with chitosan.21

The
development of chitosan/synthetic polymer-based blends by solution
mixing and casting has been in focus over the last two decades, as
the chitosan films prepared from acidic solutions are brittle.22,23 Because of the poor solubility of chitosan in common organic solvents
and the requirement for specific modifications conferring aqueous
solubility, films are cast from the aqueous acidic solution of chitosan
mixed with the desired synthetic polymer.24−27 However, the chitosan films formed
in this manner turn out to be rigid and brittle, and therefore reinforcing
fillers were used to enhance the mechanical properties.27,28 The addition of plasticizers such as glycerol and sorbitol, although
enables the processability of the films, invariably results in lower
tensile strength and an increase in the elongation at break.29 This problem can be addressed to a certain extent
through blending after a suitable modification of the structure of
chitosan or through blending unmodified chitosan with other compatible
polymers. Synthetic polymers can be tailored with suitable mechanical
properties and are easily processed. However, the well-known problem
with them is the lack of biodegradability within a reasonable period
after the product’s service lifetime. Therefore, blending with
synthetic polymers that can biodegrade adds value.

In the above
context, the formation of miscible blends of chitosan
and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) through intermolecular hydrogen bonds
facilitated between the hydroxyl groups in chitosan and PEG (terminal)
has been reported.30 It was reported that
chitosan/PEG fiber could function as a potentially useful drug delivery
system. Thus, chitosan and PEG, with salicylic acid of different concentrations,
were spun into fibers. The results of the controlled release tests
showed that the amount of salicylic acid released increased with an
increase in the proportion of PEG present in the fiber. The chitosan/PEG
fibers were sensitive to pH and ionic strength, with the release rate
being accelerated at lower pH.31 Freeze-dried
chitosan/PEG semi-interpenetrating polymer network prepared by cross-linking
with glyoxal was shown to be a pH-sensitive matrix from which localized
delivery of antibiotics (amoxicillin and metronidazole) in the acidic
environment of the gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid was
accomplished.32 The evaluation of a chitosan/PEG
paste (CPP) hydrated suitably with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
as a local antibiotic delivery device was reported.33 This work concluded that CPP was an injectable, bioadhesive,
biodegradable, and biocompatible material, with the potential to allow
variable antibiotic loading, and functioned as an active, local antibiotic
released to prevent bacterial contamination, as illustrated with Staphylococcus aureus. However, it may be noted that
a blend of chitosan and PEG has been shown to phase-separate, with
time, partly driven by the tendency of PEG to crystallize.34 This has been overcome in the case of PLA by
blending it with poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymers as plasticizers,
with the PEG repeat units enabling compatibilization.35

P(EG-ran-PG) is a synthetic biocompatible
and
biodegradable polymer (the biodegradability of the random copolymer
of EG and PG with the trade name TERGITOL L Series, Dow, has been
established) that is water-soluble with a flexible backbone. It was
expected that the blending of this polymer, which would be in the
rubbery phase at room temperature (being much higher than the glass
transition temperature and melting temperature of the crystalline
domain), with chitosan may enhance the mechanical property of the
chitosan film. Further blending with biocompatible polymers such as
the random copolymer is required in biomedical applications such as
hemostasis. Blends with a biocompatible polymer such as PEG results
in phase separation arising out of crystallization, and therefore
blending with P(EG-ran-PG) that has no tendency to
crystallize at room temperature was explored. The requirements of
biocompatibility, biodegradability, water solubility/solubility in
aqueous acetic acid, poor tendency to crystallize, so that it does
not phase-separate from the blend were reasons for selecting P(EG-ran-PG). The molecular weight of the random copolymer was
chosen such that there were no apparent issues associated with the
formation of a miscible blend, which is normally the case with high-molecular-weight
polymers.

Porous blends of chitosan with a synthetic, water-soluble,
random
copolymer such as poly(EG-ran-PG) can find unique
applications in biology and biomedical fields such as hemostasis,
wound dressing, drug delivery, scaffolds for tissue regeneration,
artificial organs, filtration of fluids (purification of water, separating
organelles), and so forth. The objective of this work was to prepare
mechanically stronger and biocompatible films of chitosan by blending
with poly(EG-ran-PG), a flexible, biocompatible,
and biodegradable polymer. Unexpectedly, the formation of films with
regular pores, the size of which could be controlled by the temperature
of film preparation, was observed. The detailed results are discussed
in this paper.

Results and Discussion
The chitosan
films (thickness of 0.2 mm) formed by the process
reported here were translucent, and when folded failed by brittle
fracture. Upon suspending a small portion of the film in aqueous acetic
acid (5%), the film was swollen and disintegrated to bigger pieces
over 168 h, but did not dissolve, suggesting the formation of dehydrated
chitosan.36,37 The blend of chitosan with the random copolymer
resulted in polymer films of thickness about 0.2 mm. The blend films
(1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5) were semitransparent and failed by brittle fracture
upon folding. The 1:2 blend film showed a rough top surface with big
pin holes (fewer in number) and upon folding failed by brittle fracture.
All the blend films did not dissolve or swell in aqueous 5% acetic
acid over 168 h. This may be due to the formation of dehydrated chitosan
or a miscible blend (partial or otherwise) and most probably not due
to the formation of an immiscible blend or the presence of the random
copolymer on the surface, as the random copolymer is soluble in 2%
aqueous acetic acid.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns
of chitosan (Ch) and
the blends with the random copolymer [Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG)] are presented in Figure 1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the chitosan film
indicates the presence of broad peaks at 2θ = 10° and 2θ
= 21.5° corresponding to the reflections from the [020] and [110]
planes of chitosan. The main peak corresponding to the random copolymer
was observed at 2θ = 21.2 [with two other peaks at 2θ
= 7.8 and 41.4 of relatively much lower intensity; see Supporting Information Figure S1]. The peak around
10° is attributed to the hydrated crystalline structure of chitosan
(even the well-dried samples of chitosan contain bound water to the
extent of ∼5%). In comparison to the chitosan flakes, the 2θ
value associated with the [110] plane in a chitosan film formed from
aqueous acetic acid is shifted by ∼1.5° on the higher
side and therefore lower d-spacing, possibly due
to the formation of dehydrated chitosan. In this context, the formation
of dehydrated crystals of chitosan from the salts of acids such as
formic acid, acetic acid, and so forth, and also under prolonged heating
in water, has been reported.38,39

Figure 1 PXRD patterns of the
chitosan and Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymer blends
of different compositions.

Upon blending chitosan with the poly(EG-ran-PG)
copolymer, the intensity of the [020] plane reduces with the concomitant
shift of the diffraction from the [110] plane to a lower 2θ
value. The observation of the peak from the [110] plane indicates
the formation of the crystalline regions of chitosan upon heating
in the presence of the random copolymer, as observed in the case of
chitosan control. The decrease followed by the disappearance of the
reflections from the [020] plane could arise from deacetylation, which
could have taken place in the process of preparing films in the presence
of acetic acid at ∼100 °C.40 The 2θ value for the [110] plane in the case of the 1:1 and
1:1.5 blends is shifted to a value (19.9°) lower than the maximum
observed for the random copolymer. This suggests that the hydrated
chitosan crystals may have formed, partially, facilitated by the random
copolymer. Similar results have been discussed earlier for the plasticization
of chitosan by glycerol29 as well as a
mixture of lactic acid–glycerol–water.41 The space between the antiparallel chains in the sheets
(0.447 nm) of chitosan is not likely to be accessible to the random
copolymer, which is expected to have a much higher hydrodynamic diameter,
whereas it is not the case for water as well as acetic acid. The reason
for the facilitation of hydrated chitosan by the random copolymer
requires further investigation. The crystallinity index values of
the blends are presented in Table S1. This
suggests the reduction in the crystallinity of chitosan upon increasing
the extent of poly(EG-ran-PG). As the random copolymer
is in the rubbery phase at room temperature, it follows that the amorphous
regions of chitosan may facilitate the formation of a partially miscible
blend with the random copolymer. As pointed out earlier, all the blend
films including that of chitosan were insoluble in water–acetic
acid over a period of 168 h. For comparison, and as examples of incompatible
blends, the PXRD patterns of the blends of chitosan with PLA, a semicrystalline
polymer, PVA, an amorphous polymer, and PEG are presented in Supporting Information Figure S2.

The structure
of the Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) blend
films was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
The IR spectra of chitosan, poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymer,
and the 1:1 blend are presented in Figure 2, whereas the same for the other blends are
presented in Supporting Information Figure
S3. The FTIR spectra of chitosan powder (data not shown) as received
are characterized by three prominent peaks at 1660 (amide I, C=O
stretching from the acetyl group), 1570 (amide II predominantly from
N–H stretching), 1425 (amide III), 1380 (C–H bending),
and 1018 cm–1 (skeletal stretching associated with
the pyranose form of glucosamine repeat units). The FTIR spectra of
the chitosan film (Figure 2) formed by the evaporation of a solution of chitosan powder
in 2% aqueous acetic acid solution at 90 °C show characteristic
peaks at 1730 (shoulder; carbonyl from acetate possibly formed by
the reaction between the OH groups in chitosan and acetic acid upon
drying at 90 °C; not observed in the films dried under vacuum
at room temperature), 1606 (might be due to the shift of amide I to
lower frequency because of the presence of a large quantity of water
as assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the first cycle of heating), 1532 (amide
II, shifted by 40 cm–1 to lower frequency, in comparison
to chitosan powder, possibly because of the formation of ammonium
cation), 1444 (C–H bending), 1415 (carboxylate C–O,
symmetric), 1259, 1018, and 800 cm–1. The shifting
of the amide bands in the film form is reported to be dependent on
the pH of the polymer solution from which the film is prepared,42 and hence it was not surprising that a significant
shift in the amide II band was observed. Poly(EG-ran-PG) is identified by the characteristic IR peaks at 2870 (symmetric
C–H stretch), 1456 (C–H bending), 1349, 1294 (C–O
stretch from the random copolymer), 1248 (C–O stretch from
the random copolymer), and 1089 cm–1 (C–O–C
stretching; most intense). All the characteristic peaks of chitosan
and poly(EG-ran-PG) are observed in the blend. The
film of the 1:1 blend exhibited characteristic IR absorption peaks
at 2865 (random copolymer), 1723 (possibly the acetate carbonyl from
chitosan), 1630 (amide I), 1556 (amide II), 1378 (C–H bending
chitosan), 1250 (random copolymer), and 1089 (random copolymer) cm–1. The shifting of the amide I band from 1660 cm–1 (chitosan powder) to 1630 cm–1 (chitosan–random
copolymer blend) and the amide II band from 1570 to 1556 cm–1 suggested the presence of weak interaction between the polymers
and possibly the formation of partially miscible blends. Some of the
other characteristic peaks of chitosan and the random copolymer are
also observed to shift on blending, suggesting the formation of partially
miscible blends.43

The thermal transitions and the
associated enthalpy changes with
the 1:1 blend of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG), as measured
by DSC, are presented in Figure 3, whereas the corresponding data for the other blends
are presented in Supporting Information Figure S4. The results are summarized in Table 1. Upon the addition of chitosan, the glass
transition temperature of the copolymer is reduced, suggesting that
there could be a partial mixing between the two polymers. The melting
point as well as the heat of fusion per gram of poly(EG-ran-PG) is also reduced upon blending, suggesting partial mixing. The
temperature at which the random copolymer crystallizes and the heat
of crystallization changes is significant, suggesting partial blending
consistent with the trends reported for the PLA–poly(EG-ran-PG) blends.35 It could be
concluded that the blending led to lowering of Tg, Tm, ΔHf, and ΔHc, suggesting
partial miscibility and disruption of the crystallization of the random
copolymer by chitosan.

The
results from the TGA and DTGA of the chitosan film, poly(EG-ran-PG) random copolymer, and the 1:1 blend of the two polymers
are presented in Figure 4. It is clear from this figure that the blend shows the characteristic
degradation peaks associated with the chitosan film as well as the
random copolymer, thus confirming the presence of chitosan as well
as poly(EG-ran-PG). The TGA and DTGA of the Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) blend films and chitosan films prepared at room
temperature and at 90 °C after Soxhlet extraction (12 h) in methanol
are presented in Supporting Information Figure S5. This showed beyond any doubt that the copolymer could
not be removed from the blend when the preparation was carried out
at 90 °C, whereas it could be easily extracted from the blend
film prepared at room temperature. These data indicate that at 90
°C, chitosan and the random copolymer form a partially miscible
blend. Similar results were obtained for the other blends, but the
details are not presented here.

poly(EG-ran-PG), and the Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymer blend.

The formation of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) blends
was
also accompanied by unexpected changes in morphology that were unique
in comparison to chitosan, which formed a uniform and continuous film.
In contrast, chitosan/PEG6000 formed a phase-separated blend. The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the 1:1 Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymer blend films prepared at 90 °C are
shown in Figure 5.
This suggested the formation of films with pores of sizes varying
between 16 and 32 μm. This was also the case for the other blends
(1:0.5, 1:1.5; Supporting Information Figure
S6). As the formation of pores was not expected, the mechanism of
formation was investigated at some depth by varying the conditions
of preparation of the film, especially temperature. The blend films
prepared by drying under ambient conditions for 1–2 weeks were
continuous as in the case of chitosan (Supporting Information Figure S7). The blend films dried at room temperature
for 3 to 4 days followed by additional drying at 40 and 60 °C
for 24 h were also continuous (Supporting Information Figure S7). When the preparation of the film was carried out directly
at higher temperatures, films with different pore sizes were observed:
3–4 μm (at ∼70 °C) and 1–2 μm
(at 60 °C), as shown in Figure 5. The formation of pores upon drying a polymer or polymer
blend is reported to proceed by three different routes: (i) temperature-induced
phase separation;44−46 (ii) breath figure mechanism;47,48 and (iii) the forced drying of solvent from a waterborne nanocomposite
polymer latex.49,50 The formation of a breath figure
requires the presence of a low-boiling organic solvent, which preferably
does not mix with water, and high humidity. As nanofillers such as
silica are also not present in our system, the forced drying of a
solvent under this condition is not met. From the three known mechanisms
of pore formation, temperature-induced phase separation appears to
be the most likely mechanism of pore formation. Thus, the mixture
of chitosan, random copolymer, acetic acid, and water, which appeared
to be a uniform and homogeneous mixture at room temperature, undergoes
phase separation into polymer-rich and solvent-rich phases when heated
above 60 °C. The kinetics of this process are faster at higher
temperatures. The rate of evaporation of the solvent and the accompanying
changes in the interfacial tension may then result in pores of different
sizes, with the formation of bigger pores at higher temperatures.

and the pore size distribution of the 1:1 blend of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) formed at 90 (a), 70 (b), and 60 °C (c).

The morphology of the 1:1 blend
of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) formed at 90 °C is retained
after solvent rinsing (thrice
with methanolic sodium hydroxide at room temperature to remove acetic
acid, if any, followed by methanol, being a solvent for the random
copolymer). The SEM images of the same showing the presence of honeycomb
morphology are presented in Figure 6. It may be noted that TGA (Figure S5) confirmed the presence of chitosan and the random copolymer
in the blend after the solvent rinse. It should also be noted that
the chitosan film prepared under the same conditions as that of the
1:1 blend shows the formation of smooth and nonporous surface at all
temperatures ranging from room temperature to 90 °C (Supporting Information Figure S8). This was also
the case for the 1:1 blend films of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) prepared at room temperature to 60 °C (Supporting Information Figure S7). The SEM images of the chitosan
film and the other blends with chitosan prepared at 90 °C are
presented in Supporting Information Figure
S9. It is clear that chitosan forms a smooth film under different
conditions employed, whereas the blends are phase-separated. The films
of a 1:1 blend of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) formed in this
manner were observed to be nontoxic and biocompatible.

blend of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG)
film formed at 90 °C after rinsing with sodium hydroxide in methanol
at room temperature, followed by rinsing with methanol [at different
magnifications, as shown at the bottom of the figures (a–c)].

The morphologies of the 1:1 blends
of Ch/PEG6000 and Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) formed by slow
evaporation on a copper grid, at
room temperature, as described in the experimental
section, were also analyzed using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). The TEM images of the same are shown in Figure 7. This indicated the formation of an immiscible
blend in the case of Ch/PEG6000 and a phase-separated and possibly
partially miscible blend in the case of the 1:1 Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) blend. Under the same conditions, chitosan formed
a smooth film (Figure S10). Considering
the interlocked morphology, notably decreased crystallinity, IR spectra
of the blend membranes, and the DSC data of the blends prepared under
the optimized conditions, it can be deduced that these blend membranes
have a partially miscible character.

blend of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) (b).

Tensile Properties of the Chitosan/Poly(EG-ran-PG)
Blend Films
The stress versus strain plots for the
blends of chitosan with different weight percentages of poly(EG-ran-PG) are shown in Figure 8. The chitosan film formed under the conditions reported
here shows a tensile strength of 24 MPa. Upon blending with an increasing
proportion of the poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymer, the
tensile strength, elongation at break, and modulus increase to a maximum
of 39 MPa, 1.7%, and 45.8 MPa, respectively, before decreasing. It
is evident from the tensile data that the blend compositions of 1:0.5
and 1:1 might be optimum for enhancing the tensile properties. However,
a further increase in the weight percentage of the copolymer causes
a decrease in tensile strength from 39 to 16 MPa because of the inadequate
quantity of chitosan flakes required to bind to form a film, resulting
in premature failure. The 1:1.5 composition probably leads to the
plasticization of the chitosan matrix by the liquid copolymer (Table 2, last row), resulting
in inferior tensile strength and modulus, but surprisingly the same
elongation at break characteristic of chitosan. In fact, it could
be observed that the 1:1.5 blend had an excess liquid random copolymer
forming a shiny surface. The increase in tensile strength can be explained
as a consequence of enhanced interfacial stress transfer and synergistic
effect arising out of the rubbery poly(EG-ran-PG)
in the chitosan matrix. It was reported in the literature that the
blending of chitosan with PEG does not improve its mechanical properties
remarkably.51 The blends of chitosan with
PLA prepared by a process similar to that reported here (solution
mixing followed by casting film and drying) resulted in a lowering
of tensile strength, and the elastic modulus of chitosan decreased
with the addition of PLA. In addition to the mechanical properties,
thermal properties also revealed that the blends were incompatible.52

Contact Angle
The contact angle of water on a surface
is sensitive to the surface energy and morphology. Smaller contact
angles imply more hydrophilic as well as rougher surfaces. The water
contact angles of a chitosan film, the chitosan/PEG 1:1 blend, and
the Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) 1:1 blend are shown in Figure S11. From this figure, it is evident that
the contact angle is reduced from 81.7 to 41.4 upon blending chitosan
with PEG alone (surface free energy, 43 mJ/m2). This is
due to the formation of an immiscible blend with the consequent presence
of PEG segments at the air–polymer film interface. The film
of the Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) (1:1) blend, with an average
porosity of 12–20 μm, exhibited a contact angle similar
to that observed for the chitosan film (82.3). This, at first assessment,
suggests the presence of chitosan molecules and not the random copolymer,
as it is water-soluble, and would therefore lead to a low contact
angle.

[3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]
Assay In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The current limitations of wound
dressings used for treating burn-induced septic wound injuries are
that they are not porous and do not enable contact with air. The porous
blends prepared in this work could act as a better microbial barrier
than neat chitosan. The nontoxic nature of the blend films was ascertained
by [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]
(MTT) assay. The relative cell viability between the mesenchymal cells grown on the Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) scaffolds
surface and on the control chitosan film substrate (without copolymer)
is shown in Figure 9. This shows that after 24 h, the average cell viability for the
samples Ch/PEG and Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) (1:1) increased
compared to the control (chitosan film). The cell viability values
for the blends Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) (1:0.5) and Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) (1:1.5) were similar to that for the control, chitosan.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the 1:1 blend of Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) scaffold is nontoxic to the mesenchymal stem cell line.

and
its blends, as assessed by MTT assay.

Cell Adhesion Studies
Cell adhesion is a critical parameter
when evaluating whether or not a scaffold is biocompatible and suitable
for tissue regeneration. SEM was used to observe the cell morphology
and the contacts between the cells and scaffolds, as shown in Figure 10. It could be inferred
from these images that mesenchymal stem cells adhered
strongly on the chitosan scaffolds as well as Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) 1:1 blend films and were confluent at some areas after 48 h
of cell seeding. The Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) 1:1 blend
samples not only ensure that the stem cells grow normally but also
promote their proliferation, which means that the blend films were
biocompatible and bioactive. One possible reason for this could be
the similarity between the structures of chitosan and glycosaminoglycans.
It may be noted that glycosaminoglycans constitute the main protein
component of the extracellular matrixes and play an important role
during the process of adhesion, proliferation, and shaping of the
cell.53 The results indicate that the Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) blends have good attachment with the mesenchymal stem cells and better biocompatibility.

Conclusions
The
nontoxic and biocompatible porous films of the biodegradable
polymer blends of chitosan/poly(EG-ran-PG) with tailored
pore sizes of the order of 1–32 μm are prepared by solvent
casting from an aqueous acetic acid solution followed by drying at
different temperatures. The SEM and TEM analyses suggested the formation
of partially miscible blends with an organized porous morphology.
The porous morphology may have arisen out of temperature-induced phase
separation (followed by the extraction of the random copolymer in
methanol in some cases). The 1:1 blend exhibited better tensile properties
than the chitosan film. The blends were nontoxic to the mesenchymal stem cells and enabled their growth, suggesting that the method
of preparation might be useful in various biomedical fields as well
as in the preparation of filtration membranes.

Experimental Section
Materials
Commercial chitosan from crab shells [Mn = 51 000 Da; 80% deacetylated as determined
by FTIR spectroscopy] was purchased from M/s. Matsyafed, Kochi, Kerala,
India. The poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymer [Mn 12 000, liquid; propylene glycol (PG) content
by 1H NMR = 22.8 mol %] was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). PEG of molecular weights 4000 (PEG-4000; mp
58–61 °C) and 6000 (PEG-6000), PLA, and PVA were procured
from Fisher Scientific Ltd., Mumbai. Laboratory-grade acetic acid
was purchased from J.T. Baker, USA. Sodium hydroxide and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. High-performance
liquid chromatography-grade water, methanol, and ethanol were purchased
from Merck, India.

Methods
Preparation of the Ch/Poly(EG-ran-PG) Blend
Films
One gram of chitosan was added to 100 mL of 2% (v/v)
acetic acid solution in water (0.037 mol of acetic acid and 5.444
mol of water) at 25–30 °C. The mixture was stirred under
continuous agitation for 10 h (approximately) at ambient temperature.
The desired quantity of the liquid poly(EG-ran-PG)
copolymer (0.5 or 1 or 1.5 or 2 g, as the case may be) was added to
the chitosan solutions such that the compositions of the blends of
poly(EG-ran-PG):chitosan were 0.5:1.0 or 1.0:1.0
or 1.5:1.0 or 2.0:1.0 (w/w), respectively. The resulting solutions
were stirred well, upon which a completely miscible solution (to the
eye, no visible phase separation was observed in this process) was
formed. The entire mixture was then poured onto a Petri dish, the
bottom of which was covered with a Teflon-coated film (to enable smooth
removal of the film after drying). The Petri dish was placed in an
oven equipped with hot air circulation for 10–12 h and maintained
at 90 °C for all the blends and at 50, 60, 70, and 90 °C
for the 1:1 blend. The films thus obtained were peeled off and subjected
to further tests.

Characterization
NMR spectroscopic
measurements in
solution were carried out with a Bruker Avance spectrometer (operating
at 400 MHz for proton) using CDCl3 as the solvent. Gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) of chitosan was performed using a
Waters GPC system (two ultrahydrogel 250 SS columns of 30 cm ×
7.8 mm; 0.1 N sodium nitrate in 20 mL glacial acetic acid and 1000
mL water as the mobile phase, 0.8 mL/min flow rate) equipped with
a refractive index detector. Narrow molecular weight PEG standards
were used for calibration. The PXRD patterns were recorded using a
Bruker D8 Advance (Germany) diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode
(Cu Kα source of the wavelength of 1.5406 Å) between 5
and 60° (2θ). The FTIR spectra were obtained with a Bruker
Alpha model using the film samples of chitosan, chitosan/poly(EG-ran-PG) blends, and poly(EG-ran-PG). The
thin films were prepared by drying 2% aqueous acetic acid solutions
on a Petri dish in a hot air oven. In the case of the random copolymer,
a drop of the sample was used directly for the FTIR measurements.
The spectra of all the samples were recorded after baseline correction.
DSC was performed using a TA Instruments Q200 modulated DSC device,
equipped with a refrigerated cooling system (window of operation −90
to 300 °C). About 2.5–10 mg of the sample to be analyzed
was placed in a Tzero aluminum pan and
sealed with a Tzero lid for solid samples.
The pan was cooled using liquid nitrogen. On the basis of the standards,
the DSC data reported here are reliable above −80 °C in
the heating cycle and up to −60 °C in the cooling cycle.
The samples were heated and cooled at the rate of 10 °C/min.
The thermal decomposition of all the materials was studied using a
TA Instruments Q500 Hi-Res thermogravimetric analyzer. Around 5 mg
of the sample was taken in a platinum pan and heated from 35 to 900
°C at 10 °C/min, with the sample purged by nitrogen flow
at the rate of 60 mL/min. The SEM images were obtained using an FEI
Quanta 400 scanning electron microscope at an acceleration voltage
of 30 kV. A Cressington sputter coater (108 Auto) was used for sputtering
gold onto the film surfaces before analysis. The TEM images were recorded
using an FEI Tecnai T20 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage
of 200 kV. The samples to be imaged were cast directly onto copper
grids from solution and dried at room temperature. The intensity of
the electron beam was kept very low to prevent any damage or inadvertent
production of any artifacts on the sample. The tensile properties,
such as tensile strength, elongation at break, and elastic modulus,
of the prepared films were evaluated using an AG-1 electronic universal
testing machine (UTM) controlled suitably through a computer (Shimadzu
Corporation, Japan), in accordance with the ASTM Method D 882-88.
Tensile testing was carried out under ambient conditions with a cross-head
speed of 5 cm/min. The chitosan film required for UTM was prepared
by casting a film from an aqueous solution, the details of which were
described earlier. The water contact angle (sessile drop method) was
measured using a Holmarc model HO-IAD-Cam-01B, equipped with a camera.
Deionized (DI) water was used as the probe.

Cell Culture and Film Preparation
The mesenchymal
stem cells (C3H10T1/2) were purchased from the National Centre
for Cell Sciences, Pune, India. The biological reagents used for the
cell culture experiments such as Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, with 4.5 g/L glucose, 4.0 mM glutamine, and sodium pyruvate),
penicillin/streptomycin (10 000 μg/mL), fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 0.25% trypsin–EDTA (1×), and PBS, pH 7.4
were obtained from Gibco, India. Only 5% CO2 was used.
The mesenchymal cells were plated in a flask (7 ×
105 per 25 cm2), maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10 000 μ/mL),
and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The polymer films were cut into sizes of 0.5 × 0.5
cm and 1 × 1 cm, and then the residual solvent (acetic acid)
present in it, if any, was neutralized using NaOH (in methanol). The
films were then sterilized using 95% ethanol for at least 30 min under
a laminar flow hood. Then, they were rinsed with sterile DI water
followed by 1× PBS wash. Finally, both sides of the films were
exposed to UV irradiation and dried for 30 min.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The cytotoxicity of the chitosan
film and chitosan blends prepared from the poly(EG-ran-PG) copolymers of different ratios was studied using MTT assay on
mesenchymal stem cells. In brief, 10 000 cells/well in 100
μL final volumes were seeded into a 96-well plate. Once the
cells were 70% confluent, the media were removed, and the wells were
washed with PBS and replaced with serum-free media. The sterilized
films, n = 5, for each of chitosan, Ch/PEG, and Ch/poly(EG-ran-PG) (1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:1.5) were placed gently into each
well, above the cells, and the wells without the films were regarded
as control. After 24 h of incubation, the wells were emptied, and
100 μL of the MTT reagent from the stock (5 mg/mL in PBS) was
added to each well, such that the final concentration was 0.5 mg/mL.
Then, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After incubation, the wells were emptied again,
and 200 μL DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the insoluble
purple formazan crystals. The 96-well plate was then placed on a rocker
for 20 min, and then the absorbance at 570 nm was measured spectrophotometrically
in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader.

Cell Adhesion
The cell morphology and their adhesion
on the scaffold were observed using SEM. All the films of 1 ×
1 cm (n = 3) were placed on a 24-well plate, and
50 000 cells/well in 500 μL final volume were seeded
into the wells above the film. The cells were maintained at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 48 h, the films were removed
and washed with 1× PBS (twice) to remove the unattached cells
and then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 3 h at 4 °C. The
films were then dehydrated with a series of ethanol concentration
(20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%) for 30 min each. Finally, the samples were
dried under sterile conditions and were coated with gold to observe
the cell attachment by SEM.
