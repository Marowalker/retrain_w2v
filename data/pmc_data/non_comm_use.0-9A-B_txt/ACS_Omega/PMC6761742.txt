Here,
we develop and verify the performance of a hybrid molecular
modeling approach that combines coarse-grained apolar solvent and
atomistic solute or polar solvent description, for example, for description
of reverse micellar systems. The coarse-grained solvent model is directly
applicable to organic solvents encompassing alkane, alkene, and fatty
acid ester functional groups and connects directly to both standard
united-atom GROMOS 53A6 and all-atom CHARMM27 force fields, as well
as the atomistic detail water models compatible with these force fields.
The different levels of description are coupled via explicit, unscaled
electrostatics, and scaled mixing rules for dispersive interactions.
The hybrid model is in near-quantitative agreement with fully atomistic
simulations when combined with the CHARMM27 model but underestimates
modestly surfactant aggregation when using GROMOS 53A6 united-atom
description. The use of truncated electrostatics affords up to a 9-fold
increase in computational speed without significant loss of accuracy.
However, long-range electrostatic calculations and load imbalance
at high core counts can significantly degrade the performance. We
demonstrate the usability of the hybrid model by assessing the reverse
micelle formation of a homologous series of nonionic glycerolipids
via large-scale self-assembly simulations. The presented model is
demonstrated here for accurate description of surfactant systems in
apolar solvents, with and without also polar solvent (water) in the
system. The formulation can be expected to describe well also other
solute species or interfaces with an apolar solvent in an apolar environment.

Introduction
Surfactants in apolar
solvents form reverse micellar and emulsion
systems that are both technologically and fundamentally significant.
They are commonly used as highly tunable and dynamic platforms for
drug delivery,1 protein separation,2 and templates for inorganic nanoparticle synthesis.3 Additionally, surfactant–apolar solvent
systems are present and have an important role in cosmetics, paints,
biobased oils, and alimentation.4 At the
same time, the often significant sensitivity to microscopic, localized
detail level interactions, for example, solvent quality and hydrogen
bonding,5−7 makes them interesting from a theoretical standpoint.

The modeling of apolar surfactant systems using current atomistic
molecular models is limited in the attainable size and timescales
by the computationally taxing nature of atomistic force fields, as
well as by the special characteristics of apolar systems, for example,
long relaxation times resulting from high solvent viscosity. Coarse-grained
modeling approaches, which group neighboring atoms into single interaction
sites, provide access to longer characteristic relaxation times and
larger system sizes. Coarse-grained approaches have enabled, for example,
large-scale simulations of lipid membranes,8,9 protein
systems,10 and predicting structures of
polymer systems.11,12 However, localized specific interactions,
charge correlations, and sensitivity to, for example, hydrogen bonding,
which are all often observed in apolar surfactant systems, are challenging
for coarse-grained interaction models to capture. This results from
the concept relying on employing effective, delocalized interactions
to capture molecular system performance.

A computationally efficient,
accurate simulation model for apolar
systems is needed because the soft, noncrystalline nature of the aggregates
formed by surfactants in apolar solvents, in particular reverse micelles,
makes them difficult to study experimentally. While the structure
of the aggregates can be studied using, for example, scattering techniques13,14 and various probe-based and spectroscopic methods exist to characterize
the dynamics and structuring inside the polar cores,15,16 the resulting data often paints out a smeared picture of the underlying
molecular-level structure and dynamics.

Here, we develop a hybrid
model that is particularly aimed at bridging
the gap between atomistic and coarse-grained modeling to provide accurate,
enhanced computational efficiency description of surfactants in apolar
solvents. The model uses supra-atomic coarse-grained detail for the
apolar solvent environment yet retains atomistic detail for those
molecular species that bear the features leading to the microscopic
detail sensitivity in the structure and dynamics of these systems.
The supra-atomic coarse-graining approach is similar to most coarse-grained
models with the exception that water is usually coarse-grained supramolecularly.

The key challenge in hybrid molecular modeling is how to couple
the atomistic and coarse-grained species together. The approaches
taken in the literature vary and mostly concentrate on aqueous systems.
For instance, for their PACE protein model, Han and co-workers17−20 opted to explicitly parametrize the all-atom/coarse-grained (AA/CG)
cross-interactions against small-molecule hydration data. The approach
enabled affordable aqueous folding simulations of several small proteins.
Rzepiela et al.21 and later Wassenaar et
al.22 coupled the coarse-grained MARTINI23 model with the atomistic GROMOS force field24 by embedding atomistic solutes inside a virtual
coarse-grained representation of the said solute, while another approach
was utilized by Riniker et al.25,26 and the developers
of the ELBA model,27,28 who derived parameters for the
AA/CG interactions using standard mixing rules. However, the authors
found that scaling the resulting parameters was necessary for accuracy.
Notably, Orsi et al. have presented a hybrid approach for coarse-grained
water solvating atomistic detail solutes where the accuracy persists
without scaling.29,30 Finally, perhaps the most complicated
and ambitious approach taken is the so called adaptive resolution
methods. The above examples all utilize a static, molecule-based division
between coarse-grained and fine-grained components, but in the so
called AdResS approach, solvent molecules are allowed to change dynamically
between different representations based on, for example, whether or
not the molecule is considered bulk-like or interfacial. With this
approach, any challenges in coupling a coarse-grained model to fine-grained
features of the system are largely avoided (see, for example, refs (31−33)).

Also, for surfactants in apolar solvents,
namely, reverse micelles,
hybrid modeling approaches have been employed a handful of times.
Brodskaya and Mudzhikova34−36 coarse-grained both the surfactant
and the solvent but retained atomistic representation of water and
counterions to model the aqueous core of AOT reverse micelles. The
coupling between atomistic and coarse-grained parts of the system
was achieved through combination rules. This approach was also taken
by Brown and Clarke,37 although at a considerably
coarser scale and a separately parametrized coupling scheme. Nevidimov
and Razumov38,39 chose to apply coarse-graining
only to the apolar solvent, while the surfactant, water, and ions
were represented in full atomistic detail. This enabled them to undertake
large-scale self-assembly simulations of AOT reverse micelles.39 Furthermore, even though the approach can still
be considered fully atomistic modeling, Braun et al.40 and Schmollngruber et al.41 have
successfully combined united-atom and all-atom descriptions to model
AOT reverse micellar systems.

The model we develop here is a
general apolar solvent coarse-grained
model that encompasses hydrocarbon and ester group containing species
as a solvent environment. In particular, the coarse-grained model
focuses on description of biologically relevant compounds, such as
triglycerides and fatty acid esters, because of the increasing interest
in using biobased compounds in formulations. The model can be combined
with existing all-atom detail models for surfactants or other solutes
including atomistic detail water and ions, which gives it a very wide
usability range. Furthermore, the proposed coarse-grained model reproduces
to a large part the energetics and characteristics of fully atomistic
models for the solvent species by explicitly accounting for hydrogen
bonding via the use of dipolar sites. We test the coupling of the
coarse-grained model to atomistic models with two commonly used force
fields of different levels of description, namely, united-atom GROMOS
56A624 and explicit-hydrogen CHARMM27,42 and benchmark the resulting hybrid model for
computational performance. Finally, we demonstrate the use and usability
of the new hybrid description via examining the dependence of the
aggregation mechanism on the surfactant structure for a homologous,
systematic series of nonionic glycerolipids in an apolar triglyceride
solvent. The current work exceeds the prior efforts in (1) generality,
that is, it covers a wider range of apolar solvents than only model
hydrocarbon solvents and covers also complex biological apolar solvents,
(2) the usability range, as it is fully compatible with existing major
atomistic detail force fields including water models, and (3) also
the extent of model verification, which covers both molecular characteristics
and self-assembly response of a set of surfactants.

Methods
Parametrization
The supra-atomic coarse-grained (CG)
solvent model follows roughly a 3-to-1 mapping: on average, 3 connected
heavy atoms and the associated hydrogens are represented by a single
CG interaction site (bead). To account for the strong dipoles of ester
groups, these additionally carry an off-center charged particle. To
reduce the overall complexity of the model, a minimal number of beads
is used. Except for the number of mapped hydrogens, each CG bead corresponds
to a well-defined target structure at the atomistic detail level.
This means that, for example, three methylene groups, two methylene
groups terminated by a methyl group, and the propyl backbone of triglycerides
are all represented by the same bead type. The adopted approach is
similar to, for example, the MARTINI model23 but different from the SDK43 or the GROMOS
alkane CG44 models, which differentiate
between chain middle and terminal alkane beads. The here adopted approach
attempts to retain the simplicity of the MARTINI model while aspiring
for the chemical accuracy of the more complicated models. The mapping
choice is illustrated in Figure 1.

their mapping
to atomistic structure of tripalmitolein as an example. On the right,
the hierarchy of model compounds (bold) and interactions (in parentheses)
on which the parametrization is based.

For compatibility with common empirical biomolecular force fields
and simulation packages, the potential energy function of the coarse-grained
model consists of harmonic bond potentials combined with the Lennard-Jones
and Coulomb potentials for the nonbonded interactions. Bonded interactions
are modeled using harmonic bond stretching and angle bending terms 1  where kb and kθ are force constants
and b0 and θ0 are the
equilibrium values for the bond stretching and angle bending terms,
respectively. Bonded parameters are obtained via matching the resulting
equilibrium distance and angle distributions with reference distributions
obtained via center of mass based coarse-graining of fine-grained,
atomistic detail trajectories calculated for target molecules. The
CG model does not contain a specific term for torsions as a good match
with atomistic distributions for the parametrized species is obtained
even with only bond streching and bending terms (see the Supporting
Information for data). We point out that for molecular species containing
strong intramolecular interactions, torsions may be necessary in the
CG representation.

Nonbonded interactions are given by 2  where ϵij and σij are the
potential well-depth and zero distance of the Lennard-Jones potential
and q is the charge of the particle. Nonbonded interactions
between 1−2 bonded pairs are excluded in the model. The Lennard-Jones
parameters were fitted to reproduce the liquid density and heat of
vaporization of the model compounds, while the Coulomb interactions
of hydrogen bonding species were fitted to match the binding energy
defined based on atomistic simulation PMFs. Liquid density was evaluated
directly from a bulk NPT simulation, while the heat of vaporization
ΔHm was calculated according to 3  where Epot(g) and Epot(l) are the
potential
energies per molecule in the gas phase and liquid phase, respectively,
and RT corresponds to thermal energy. The gas-phase
potential energy Epot(g) was evaluated
from a separate gas-phase simulation.

The parametrization of
the nonbonded LJ interactions was conducted
manually against a homologous series of model compounds. The parameter
adjustment was conducted in a hierarchical manner; that is the simpler
compounds such as alkanes were parameterized first after which the
obtained alkane parameters were used without further adjustment in
the more complex molecules (see Figure 1). All cross-interactions were not explicitly parametrized;
for example, the CCO-CC interaction had relatively little impact on
the properties of unsaturated esters and glycerides, and because of
this, its magnitude was determined via Lorentz–Berthelot combination
rules. Although the parametrization here was done manually, the findings
point that this tuning process could be automated, as, for example,
Reith et al. have demonstrated.45 However,
some level of manual assessment of the system is advisable to prevent
overfitting the model. The parametrization hierarchy and an explicit
listing of the beads and corresponding all-atom chemical structures
are presented in Figure 1.

Prior to general nonbonded parametrization, the structure
and electrostatic
properties of the coarse-grained ester group were devised. To ease
the task, parametrization effort focused on the carbonyl dipole: the
off-center charged particle, named O, was set to correspond to the
carbonyl oxygen. The position of the particle was determined based
on the distance from the carbonyl oxygen to the group center of mass
in atomistic simulations (0.132 nm). The mass of the particle was
set as 16u, the mass of oxygen. The rest of the ester group mass was
partitioned to the parent bead. The geometry of the ester off-center
charge at O is kept in place by a distance constraint to the ester
bead CCO-O and two angle bending terms to the adjacent beads CCC-CCO-O
and O-CCO-CCC. The strength of the carbonyl dipole and the Lennard-Jones
parameters of the particle O were initially borrowed from the GROMOS
53A6 model. Subsequently, these were periodically adjusted during
the nonbonded parametrization to reproduce the ΔG and equilibrium distance of the ester-alcohol free energy profile
at hybrid modeling resolution. As the hybrid scheme uses direct electrostatic
coupling (ϵrAA/CG = 1) between atomistic and coarse-grained species, the
parametrization of the ester bead effectively fixes the CG/AA electrostatic
coupling.

The CG/AA Lennard-Jones parameters were calculated
using the Lorentz–Berthelot
mixing rules with additional scaling applied to the well-depth ϵ.
The scaling factor was applied to all CG/AA interaction uniformly,
but the value of it was determined separately for the coupling of
C27 and 53A6 models. The optimal value of the scaling factor was obtained
by matching the free energy profile of pulling two atomistic dodecane
molecules apart in coarse-grained bulk dodecane to a fully atomistic
reference energy profile.

Fine-Grained Simulations
United-atom
GROMOS 53A624 and all-atom CHARMM C2742 force fields were used for the fine-grained
part of the hybrid model.
These versions of the respective
models (as opposed to, for example, C36 or 53A6) were chosen based
on prior experience with CHARMM force fields46 and preliminary benchmarking of binding energies against the CHARMM
Drude polarizable force field.47 van der
Waals interactions were smoothly switched to zero between 1.0 and
1.2 nm (C27) or cut at 1.4 nm (53A6). Tail correction was applied
for C27. Electrostatics were handled either by the smooth particle
mesh Ewald (PME) method48 (fourth-order
interpolation, 0.1 nm grid spacing) or reaction-field electrostatics
(ϵr = 1, ϵRF = ∞). Infinite
screening is used so that the atomistic and hybrid simulations can
employ the same parameters; notably, the chosen cutoff scheme reproduces
nearly exactly atomistic PMFs calculated using PME electrostatics
for polar compounds. All bulk simulations employed PME, while the
self-assembly simulations made use of reaction-field electrostatics
and PME in separate simulations. LINCS49 was used for all non-water distance constraints for all bonds (53A6)
or bonds containing hydrogen (C27). SETTLE50 was used to keep the water molecules rigid. These constraint approaches
allow using an integration timestep of 2 fs. The stochastic velocity
rescaling thermostat of Bussi et al.51 (τT = 0.5 ps and Tref = 298.15 K) and Parinello–Rahman barostat52 (τP = 2 ps and Pref = 1 bar) were used to implement constant
pressure and temperature conditions. The above parameters were used
in the umbrella simulations as well. In gas-phase simulations, all
interactions were included, pressure coupling was turned off, and
the stochastic dynamics thermostat was used. See Section S1 of the Supporting Information for detailed information
on the fine-grained system setup and compositions.

Coarse-Grained
and Hybrid Simulations
Parametrization
of the coarse-grained model employed 53A6 fine-grain simulation parameters
with the following exceptions: an analytical tail correction was applied
to the Lennard-Jones potential to ensure a cutoff independent density
and heat of vaporization, and with the exception of bonds connecting
off-center charges to ester groups, all coarse-grained bonds were
flexible. In the hybrid simulations, simulation parameters of the
associated fine-grained model were used with the above listed exceptions.

Umbrella Sampling Simulations
Umbrella sampling was
used to determine the potential of mean force (PMF) to estimate the
free energy profiles between various species. Starting configurations
for the umbrella sampling windows were generated by pulling two binding
species apart at a rate of 0.002 nm/ps. Approximately 5–10
windows were created at ∼0.2 nm intervals. Each window was
simulated for 40 ns (500 ns for the dodecane in dodecane PMF), and
the PMF was extracted using the weighted histogram analysis method.53,54 A force constant of 500 kJ mol–1 nm–2 was used for the harmonic umbrella potential. The PMF estimates
presented in this work include the 2RT ln (z) Jacobian entropy correction.55

Benchmarks
The step-to-step performances of atomistic
and hybrid resolution simulations were measured using monopalmitolein/dodecane
systems. Final configurations of 200 ns atomistic self-assembly simulations
were used as initial configurations and subsequently converted to
hybrid resolution to eliminate any bias from differing starting configurations.
Benchmarks were run on full nodes of the CSC Sisu supercomputer with
each node consisting of 24 Intel Haswell cores (E5-2690v3, 2.6 GHz).
Each simulation was run for at least 10000 steps, and cycle counters
were reset halfway.

Results and Discussion
Coarse-Grained Solvent
Model
Table 1 lists the coarse-grained model parameters,
while Figure 2 compares
the density and heat of vaporization of the employed parametrization
target molecules to experimental and simulated reference data (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for reference
data and Table S2 for numerical data on
properties of coarse-grained model compounds). The data shows that
the presented coarse-grained model parameters lead to target properties
of pure hydrocarbons being well reproduced. However, for esters, a
set of parameters, which would perfectly capture the entire target
data set, could not be found, and the presented parameters are a compromise.
Specifically, perfectly matching the properties of monoesters resulted
in overestimation of triglyceride Hm.
Hence, the cross-interaction between hydrocarbon and ester beads was
scaled down, which leads to the coarse-grained model systematically
underestimating monoester densities but resulting in an improved fit
for the triglycerides. This challenge in ester parametrization could
result from the simplicity of the model, which may prevent reproducing
both triglyceride and monoester properties using the same parameters.
This could very likely be resolved with separate parametrization;
however, here, we have settled on the aforementioned compromise in
the interest of simplicity and since experimental triglyceride Hm values suffer from discrepancies. These discrepancies
could not be resolved with atomistic reference data either due to
differing predictions made by C27 and 53A6. More detailed data about
the parametrization is provided in the Supporting Information. In particular, Figure S1 compares bonded bead distances and angles in atomistic data with
those resulting from the coarse-grained model parameters presented
in Table 1.

Dispersive CG/AA Interactions
Next, the compatibility
of the coarse-grained model with all-atom species is examined. In
this, we take surfactants in apolar hydrocarbon solvents, that is,
reverse micellar systems, as the target parametrization system. A
common feature for many surfactant–apolar solvent systems,
that is, reverse micellar systems, is that both the surfactants and
the solvents are quite often based on aliphatic carbon chains. Specifically,
most surfactants feature one or two hydrocarbon tails, while many
common apolar solvents range from plain alkanes to hydrocarbons decorated
with polar groups, for example, alcohols and esters. Even for complex
solvents such as triglycerides, the main interaction between surfactant-like
solute species and the solvent usually is via the hydrocarbon parts
of the surfactant and the solvent. This leads to the paramount importance
of accurate reproduction of the mixing between all-atom hydrocarbons
(surfactant) and coarse-grained hydrocarbons (solvent).

To calibrate
the coupling between atomistic and coarse-grained species, we calculated
the free energy difference associated with separating two atomistic
dodecane molecules dissolved in atomistic and coarse-grained dodecane
(see Figure 3). The
data shows that utilizing standard Lorentz–Berthelot mixing
rules leads to the atomistic dodecane molecules preferentially dissolving
in the coarse-grained solvent. While in the case of the united-atom
53A6 model combined with the coarse-grained solvent, the free energy
difference of the first minima and complete separation is only slightly
overestimated in comparison to atomistic simulations by 0.4–0.5
kJ/mol, and the association energy is substantially overestimated
with the all-atom C27 model (4.7 kJ/mol). However, scaling the ϵ
parameter with a model dependent factor β appears to largely
recover the atomistic free energy landscape in both cases. We conclude
that an optimal performance is obtained if factors β = 0.975
and 0.847 for 53A6 and C27 are used, respectively. To cut down the
number of parametrized interactions, these scaling values based on
pure alkanes are utilized for all atomistic/coarse-grained cross-interactions.

Figure 3 Potential
of mean force (PMF) calculated for the center of mass
separation distance of two dodecane molecules described in atomistic
detail and dissolved in atomistic and coarse-grained dodecane. Results
for both unscaled and scaled mixing rules are shown. On the left is
data for CHARMM C27, and on the right is data for GROMOS 53A6 models.

To test the quality and performance of the scaling
scheme, the
self-aggregation of monopalmitin in coarse-grained dodecane and in
atomistic C27 or 53A6 dodecane was compared. Figure 4 shows the resulting aggregate sizes and
their time evolution. The simulations were carried out at 70 °C
due to the observed high aggregation propensity of 53A6 monopalmitin.
The figure shows reverse micelles in the system at each time by their
aggregation numbers. The hybrid simulations produce reverse micelles
with aggregation numbers consistent with the atomistic simulations,
as shown by the overlap of the distributions. The reverse micelles
are predicted to be prolate (C27) or worm-like (53A6). Experimentally,
Shrestha et al.5 have observed elongated
monoglyceride reverse micelles suggesting that the simulation-predicted
microstructure is qualitatively correct. The higher aggregation propensity
predicted by the 53A6 model appears to result from the larger dipole
moments in that model in comparison to C27 (see Figure 5 for energetics). Indeed, the partial charges
of GROMOS 53A6 were parametrized to capture aqueous solvation energetics.24 The finding demonstrates that the implicit polarization
of the underlying atomistic model is an important factor in reverse
micellar simulations, at least in conditions corresponding to low
hydration of the surfactant head groups.

size distributions in 12 wt % monopalmitin

electrostatics (RF). At the top is data for CHARMM C27, and at the
bottom is data for GROMOS 53A6 atomistic models.

Figure 5 Comparison
of potentials of mean force (PMFs) calculated using
the atomistic CHARMM C27 or GROMOS 53A6 model and the hybrid coarse-grained
CG/atomistic model. The presented PMFs are calculated between the
distance of propyl myristate ester group and hexanol hydroxyl group
(top row), water molecule (middle row), or tetramethylammonium ion
in dodecane (bottom row). Short distance deviation can be explained
by the CG bead size.

The relatively good match
between the atomistic and hybrid simulations
is undoubtedly partially fortuitous, considering the higher temperature
and small differences in the free energy profiles of Figure 3. To chart the hybrid model
sensitivity to the scaling factor β, the size distribution dependency
on β was investigated for the C27 force field (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The
data shows that systematically higher aggregation numbers are favored
when β is smaller. A significant change occurs with only a 2%
change in the coupling parameter. This suggests that the shape of
the reverse micellar aggregate is very sensitive toward the tail-solvent
mixing energy, both in all-atom and in the hybrid model; the finding
is in qualitative agreement with the observations of Shrestha et al.5,63 and also our previous findings on phospholipid reverse micelles
in cyclohexane.64,65 Given, however, that β
was fitted against the dodecane chain and still reproduces aggregate
sizes of the longer-chain monopalmitin for both 53A6 and C27, we suggest
that the presented β parameters are balanced and that the β
parameter approach has a degree of transferability. Furthermore, application
of the adaptive resolution technique in the form of a fine-grained
solvent skin region could remove the sensitivity to the β parameter.
However, it is unclear how a large computational overhead maintaining
such skin regions would introduce into the relatively packed reverse
micellar system. Such an approach was not used here.

Electrostatic
Coupling
Figure 5 shows the free energy profiles of propyl
myristate (PM) binding with hexanol (HxOH), water (H2O),
and tetramethylammonium ion (TMA+). The propyl myristate–hexanol
binding energy was used in the parametrization of the coarse-grained
ester group, while the latter two binding species were used to investigate
the transferability of the parameters. In the potential of mean force
profiles, the depth of the minimum corresponds to the binding free
energy of the two species, that is, free energy difference corresponding
to binding of the two compounds in the solvent. The data shows that,
for charge neutral species, the hydrogen bonding energy in the hybrid
simulations is reasonably well reproduced in comparison to the fully
atomistic reference systems (within 1.6 kJ/mol in all cases). However,
the ion–dipole interaction energy of the PM/TMA+ complex is overestimated by 5 kJ/mol for C27 and underestimated
by 3 kJ/mol for 53A6. The loci of the PMF minima are in similar acceptable
agreement between the atomistic and hybrid simulations for both atomistic
models. However, at close distances, the PMF rises too steeply in
the hybrid simulations, which likely results from the inaccurate description
of the shape anisotropy of the ester group at very short distances
by the CG model. This could partly be remedied by manually adjusting
the Lennard-Jones parameters between the coarse-grained ester group
and the atomistic binding species. However, as the coarse-grained
ester group lacks secondary dipoles, that is, additional charged particles,
which would form weaker dipoles with the central charged bead, we
did not pursue this here as it could lead to overfitting of the model.

To further validate the electrostatic coupling between atomistic
and the coarse-grained descriptions in the hybrid model, a system
of 21 wt % monopalmitin in bulk propyl decenoate at 25 °C was
characterized in terms of aggregate size distributions. This solvent/surfactant
pair has sufficiently fast dynamics even at room temperature for the
system to reach a converged size distribution within the simulation
duration. The resulting size distributions are shown in Figure 6. The data shows that the aggregate
size distribution is qualitatively reproduced for both C27 and 53A6
force fields. However, the free surfactant concentration is overestimated
for both force fields. Furthermore, the hybrid 53A6 simulations underestimate
the aggregation propensity producing too steeply decaying aggregate
size distribution in comparison to fully fine-grained reference data.
This is rather curious since the free energy profiles presented in Figures 3 and 5 are generally better reproduced by the 53A6 model than by
the C27 model. We speculate that the self-interaction energy of 53A6
propyl decenoate differs somewhat from that of the coarse-grained
one leading to the observed deviations. This suggests that, for balanced
interactions, hybrid models should use the target atomistic energetics
rather than experimental data as the reference data.

Effect of Long-Range Electrostatics
It is well known
that truncation of Coulomb interactions can lead to various simulation
artifacts.66−69 However, for computational efficiency, coarse-grained models commonly
incorporate interactions that have electrostatic origin, that is,
dipole–dipole and even charged interactions, into short-ranged
effective potentials, which are then truncated at a suitable distance.
The truncation is somewhat justified by the fast r–6 decay of thermally averaged dipolar interactions
and the strong charge screening in the aqueous environment. However,
the low dielectric permittivity of apolar solvents and the coexistence
of coarse-grained and atomistic species in the present hybrid simulations
make it unclear how much long-range electrostatics contribute to the
structural and dynamical characteristics of the simulated systems.
The presented model will describe charged species well, as long as
the charges are in a molecular environment enabling properly their
screening. The selected reaction-field electrostatic scheme, with
infinite screening at the cutoff, will cause deviations in the description
of charged species interactions in the dominantly apolar surroundings
where the Debye screening length is long.

The effect of neglecting
long-range electrostatics was tested by recalculating the size distributions
in Figures 4 and 6 using also truncated electrostatics in addition
to the PME electrostatics. We chose reaction-field electrostatics
(RF) with infinite screening beyond the cutoff as the truncation scheme
due to its ability to reproduce hydrogen bonding PMFs calculated using
PME almost exactly (present work, data not shown) and the energy conservation
it affords over straight cutoff schemes in prior simulations.70Figures 4 and 6 show that, in the test systems,
PME and truncated electrostatics yield size distributions and aggregation
kinetics in close agreement with one another—both for fine-grained
and hybrid simulations. This suggests that truncated electrostatics
can be used for neutral reverse micellar systems without compromising
the accuracy of the system description. We note, however, that simulations
of systems containing mobile ions such as Aerosol OT reverse micelles
or charged lipids should probably employ PME electrostatics.

Performance
Next, the speedup over standard atomistic
methodology, as well as the scaling characteristics of the hybrid
resolution model, is assessed by comparing representative model systems
at different levels of resolution. Additionally, the effect of truncating
electrostatic interactions on computational performance is assessed.

To probe the maximum achievable speedup between atomistic and coarse-grained
representations, a system of pure propyl myristate in its bulk state
(3200 molecules) was simulated both in the coarse-grained and atomistic
details. With PME electrostatics, the speedup varies in the range
of 1.3–2.8 and 4.2–13.3 in comparison to united-atom
53A6 and all-atom C27 force fields, respectively. The use of truncated
electrostatics increases the speedup factors to 4.1–4.8 and
21.3–31.6. The same electrostatics parameters are used when
comparing models of different description levels; that is, also truncated
electrostatic performance is compared between atomistic simulations
using truncated electrostatics and hybrid CG-atomistic simulations
using truncated electrostatics and correspondingly for PME performance
comparison. In both cases, the performance advantage of the coarse-grained
model decreases as more CPU cores are utilized. For truncated electrostatics,
this effect appears to result from the natural scaling characteristics
of the underlying simulation software; that is, the number of atoms
per core slowly approaches the scaling limit. For PME, however, the
coarse-grained simulations suffer from the mesh part of the PME algorithm
becoming a bottleneck. This suggests that the best value for the CPU
time for simulations using this hybrid model is obtained with low
core counts and truncated electrostatics.

As a more realistic
test case, the 12 wt % monopalmitin/dodecane
self-assembly simulations presented in Figure 4 were also benchmarked (see Figure 7). With PME electrostatics,
the relative performance varies between 0.7 and 1.5 and 2.3 and 5.9
for 53A6 and C27, respectively. With truncation of electrostatics,
these numbers increase to 1.0–2.8 and 3.6–8.7, respectively.
While the scaling characteristics mirror those obtained from the pure
solvents, it is interesting to note that the hybrid simulations suffer
at high node counts from severe load imbalance due to domain decomposition.
This results from the heterogeneous particle density present in the
system, that is, relatively sparse solvent, which atomistic reverse
micelles of high particle density traverse randomly. Dealing with
such a setup appears very difficult for the present load balancing
algorithms.

Figure 7 Benchmarking data for C27 (left) and 53A6 (right). In the figure,
black corresponds to hybrid resolution, green to united-atom GROMOS
53A6 force field, and blue to all-atom C27 force field. Filled symbols
and solid lines correspond to simulations with PME electrostatics,
and empty symbols and dashed lines correspond to reaction-field electrostatics.
Each node consists of 24 Intel Haswell cores (E5-2690v3, 2.6 GHz).

The benchmarking data here corresponds to a formal
step-to-step
speedup factor, which neglects the artificial acceleration of diffusion
processes resulting from coarse-graining. To investigate the significance
of such acceleration in the hybrid simulations, we calculated the
surfactant diffusion coefficients from the monopalmitolein/propyl
decenoate simulations (the dodecane simulations yielded poor statistics
due to the slowly diffusing aggregates). For the 53A6 model, surfactant
diffusion was 1.7–1.8 times faster in the coarse-grained solvent,
and for C27, the numbers were 3.7–5.2. For truncated electrostatics,
the diffusion increase was less than for PME electrostatics. For C27,
additionally, the diffusion of diglycerol monopalmitolein in tripalmitolein
was assessed; surfactant diffusion was found to be 9 times faster
than in atomistic detail simulations (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information for size distribution comparison).
This rather significant speedup suggest that, for triglycerides at
least, switching to the coarse-grained solvent representation may
be worthwhile even if there would not be other computational advantage.

Application: Self-Assembly of Glycerolipids in Apolar Solvents
Prior computational46 and experimental63,71−74 studies have suggested that the aggregation mechanism and aggregate
morphology of nonionic surfactants in apolar media can be tuned by
adjusting the polarities of the surfactant headgroup and solvent.
Here, we apply the present hybrid model to a homologous series of
glycerolipid surfactants containing 1–3 hydroxyl groups per
headgroup and 1–2 hydrocarbon tails (see Figure 8 for the structures and abbreviations). The
simulations are performed in both dodecane and tripalmitolein solvents
in the presence and absence of moisture (water-to-surfactant molar
ratio w0 = 1 – 2). With this mapping,
we aim to establish the conditions at which reverse micellization
becomes favored over oligomerization.

Figure 8 Examined single- and double-tailed glycerolipids
(top) and their
self-assembly size distributions in dodecane and tripalmitolein with
(right panels) and without (left panels) residual moisture. Surfactant
concentration varies in the ranges of 106–111 and 286–323
mM in dodecane and tripalmitolein, respectively. The corresponding
water-to-surfactant ratios are w0 = 1
and w0 = 2. See Table S3 in the Supporting Information for detailed composition of
each system. Solid lines correspond to smoothed size distributions;
see Section S5 in the Supporting Information
for description of the procedure.

Figure 8 presents
the size distributions resulting from the simulations. Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information
show the corresponding time series. The prevalent association mechanism
can be inferred from the shape of the size distribution: a straight
line indicates classical indefinite, stepwise association, while curviness
and the existence of a local minimum indicate cooperativity and a
separate micellar population of preferred size (see ref (46) for more detailed discussion).
The data shows that, in dodecane, the aggregation mode smoothly switches
from stepwise association to cooperative reverse micellization as
the headgroup polarity increases. The crossover from one mechanism
to another appears for surfactants with two hydroxyl groups per headgroup
with less polar surfactants following stepwise association and more
polar surfactant cooperative association. For diglycerol monopalmitolein,
the cooperativity of the aggregation was comparable to aqueous systems,
and a reliable estimate for the size distribution could not be obtained.
Contrary to this, in a tripalmitolein environment, all studied surfactants
associate via the oligomerization mechanism. This is due to the hydrogen
bonding ability of the solvent, which attenuates intersurfactant bonding.
The data reveals both the significance of the hydrogen bonding capability
of the surfactants in the formation of the reverse micelles but also
the competing influence of the solvent hydrogen bonding ability. Similarly,
solution additives with the hydrogen bonding ability can be expected
to influence aggregation (see, for example, ref (75)).

In dodecane, an
increase in tail count decreases the size of the
aggregates provided that the aggregation propensity is high enough
for the formation of large reverse micelles. This behavior suggests
that the increased steric repulsion due to two tails contributes significantly
to aggregation only if a certain minimum level of crowdedness is met
at the solvent/tail shell. Contrary to this hypothesis, in tripalmitolein,
the double-tailed variants show a slightly higher overall aggregation
propensity in comparison to single-tailed surfactants. This effect,
however, appears to result from differences in headgroup size: at
the relatively high surfactant concentration employed in the simulations,
the elongated headgroups of diglycerol dipalmitolein (DGDP) and triglycerol
dipalmitolein (TGDP) are more likely to reach an existing aggregate
(and therefore be counted as a member) than their single-tailed variants
(MGMP, DGMP). A preliminary set of simulations at approximately 120
mM concentration showed the same trends, but much smaller differences
between single- and double-tailed surfactants support this explanation.

Addition of water substantially increases the aggregation propensity
in dodecane shifting all surfactants to favor cooperative reverse
micellization over oligomerization (a separate population of reverse
micelles emerges). The effect is, however, much more attenuated for
double-tailed surfactants suggesting that the tail structure is an
important control factor in reverse micellar systems. Visually, at
these low hydration levels, water molecules are dispersed throughout
the polar core region and only occasionally coalesce into a separate
central water droplet. In tripalmitolein, addition of water increased
the aggregation propensity slightly, but the aggregation mechanism
remains essentially as oligomerization.

Shrestha et al. have
conducted numerous X-ray scattering studies
on the reverse micellization of nonionic glycerolipids.63,71,76 While quantitative comparison
cannot be made due to slight variations in tail structure, temperature,
solvent chain length, and lack of moisture control, qualitatively,
their observations are in agreement with the simulation results here.
Namely, they report that the size of the reverse micelles increases
with the headgroup size of the surfactant,71 while the increase in tail length76 or
in the number of tails63 decreases the
overall aggregate size. Addition of water was reported to increase
the average aggregate size.71

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a coarse-grained hydrocarbon solvent
model that can be combined with existing atomistic detail models for
both solutes and, for example, polar solvent species. We coupled the
models with two atomistic force fields, namely, GROMOS 53A6 and CHARMM27,
and verified the performance. The presented work encompasses both
evaluation of the model construction and parametrization but also
an assessment of the benefits and pitfalls of hybrid simulations in
a reverse micellar setting. The findings suggest that, while good
agreement between hybrid and atomistic simulations is achievable with
relatively simple means, the direct coupling scheme employed in this
paper also has some drawbacks. In particular, even though the hybrid
scheme offers an increase in computational performance, scaling issues
due to long-scale electrostatics and inhomogeneous particle density
result in significant load imbalance at high core counts. This prevents
the hybrid simulations from reaching substantially longer timescales
than feasible with atomistic detail approaches. This problem is likely
to affect all simulations using a similar coupling approach to this
work.

We also report the aggregation responses of a homologous
series
of single- and double-tailed glycerolipids under various solvents
and hydration conditions. The findings indicate that the headgroup
polarity, particularly the hydrogen bonding donor capabilities of
the headgroup, has a key role in determining the aggregation propensity
of the surfactant. Further, water increases and surfactant hydrogen
bonding with the solvent significantly decreases the cooperativity
of the aggregation process. Finally, surfactant reverse micelles formed
with single-tailed surfactants are significantly larger than those
formed by surfactants with two tails. The presence of the second tail
also promotes oligomerization as the aggregation mechanism. Altogether,
the modeling work shows that, besides the usual oligomerization and
cooperative association mechanisms, the reverse micellar systems also
often bear characteristics of both of these; that is, the aggregation
mechanism is mixed. This study is, to our knowledge, the first detailed
computational investigation in which the mechanism of apolar aggregation
is systematically evaluated. The work also presents for the first
time with reasonable accuracy the shapes of the aggregate size distributions
of reverse micelles of such glycerolipids or similar species. The
results show that molecular dynamics simulations are able to provide
detailed information on the aggregation response of surfactants also
in these complex, dynamic apolar systems and to generate understanding
of the nature of apolar solution surfactant aggregation. As the examined
systems are of high chemical engineering importance, the findings
could aid in tuning process solutions via engineering aggregate size
distributions or enabling enhanced control of aggregation.
