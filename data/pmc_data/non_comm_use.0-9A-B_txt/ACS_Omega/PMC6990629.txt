Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are the spearhead
of targeted
therapies. According to the technology used, the conjugation of a
cytotoxic drug to an antibody can produce suboptimal heterogeneous
species, impacting the overall efficacy. Herein, we describe the synthesis
of HER2-targeting ADCs with three disulfide rebridging heads, allowing
homogeneous and site-specific bioconjugation: dibromomaleimide (DBM),
dithiomaleimide (DTM), and hybrid thio-bromomaleimide (TBM) chemical
bricks to combine the properties of both previously used heads. The
primary purpose of this study was to compare the reactivity of these
three chemical bricks in the bioconjugation process. Then, the resulting
ADCs were evaluated in terms of physicochemical stability, binding,
and biological activity. We have demonstrated that the higher percentage
of a drug-to-antibody ratio of 4 was obtained with TBM. Additionally,
the reaction time was drastically reduced with TBM in comparison to
DTM. The three ADCs showed good binding to HER2 and in vitro cytotoxicity,
which validate the TBM structure as an attractive alternative scaffold
for rebridging bioconjugation.

==== Body
Introduction
Nowadays, there are more than 70 antibody–drug
conjugates
(ADCs)1 in clinical development. Indeed,
they are a promising class of medicine against cancer because they
combine the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) with the cytotoxicity
of a potent payload in such a way that this drug is delivered specifically
to tumor cells overexpressing the targeted antigen. Despite significant
efforts in development, only five ADCs are currently approved by the
FDA. The first ADC to be approved in 2000 thanks to an accelerated
approval was Mylotarg for acute myeloid leukemia, an anti-CD33 mAb
attached through its lysines to a calicheamicin. In 2010, it was withdrawn
from the market because of safety issues and rehabilitated thanks
to a favorable risk–benefit balance in 2017. In 2011, Adcetris
was approved by the FDA for Hodgkin lymphoma. It is obtained by the
reduction of interchain disulfide bridges of an anti-CD30 mAb to fasten
a maleimide linker to the free cysteines. In 2013, Kadcyla, in which
an anti-HER2 mAb and DM1 are covalently linked via a lysine-based
conjugation chemistry, reached the therapeutic market against breast
cancer. Besponsa, which consists of a link between the lysines of
an anti-CD22 mAb and a calicheamicin derivative, was approved in 2017
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. More recently, in 2019, Polivy was
approved with an accelerated procedure for large B-cell lymphoma.
It combines an anti-CD79b mAb and vedotin. These five ADCs use nonspecific
bioconjugation technologies, which are the most commonly used methods:
stochastic lysine and cysteine modification. These methods present
some drawbacks such as a limited control of the drug-to-antibody ratio
(DAR) because of the random fixation on the amino acids (especially
with the lysine residues, because of their greater abundance than
reactive cysteine residues).2 Thereby,
the DAR distribution is heterogeneous, which is detrimental to the
activity and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) profile of ADCs.3 Indeed, there are unloaded species DAR 0 that
compete with the loaded species because of their unchanged affinity
for the target. Moreover, naked mAbs are less efficient than conjugated
ones. Alongside DAR 0 species, the proportion of highly conjugated
species is not negligible. These are more hydrophobic and at greater
risk to be quickly eliminated,4 decreasing
the overall efficacy of the administrated dose.

To overcome
stochastic bioconjugation drawbacks and control the
number and position of the payload, the development of new site-specific
technologies is required. Different bioconjugation techniques have
been developed. For example, using molecular biology, antibody sequence
engineering allows the introduction of orthogonal chemical handles,
giving access to site-specific conjugation: reactive cysteine residues,5 unnatural amino acids like p-acetylphenylalanine6 or selenocysteine.7 Another trend for site-specific bioconjugation
is based on enzymatic ligation with microbial transglutaminase8 for example. It is also possible to combine enzymatic
ligation and the use of unnatural amino acids with an aldehyde tag
strategy introducing a formylglycine residue that can be used for
conjugation.9 Although efficient, these
strategies require mAb modification prior to bioconjugation which
lead to increased cost and time of development. The potential number
of relevant antibodies for ADC programs entails the need of technologies
compatible with any off-the-shelf antibodies. One way to circumvent
this hurdle is to use the rebridging of interchain disulfide bridges
of the antibody with a bis-sulfone,10 a
pyridazinedione,11 a divynilpyrimidine,12 a 1,3-diacrylamide-1,3,5-triazinane13 or a next-generation maleimide head of bioconjugation.14−16 The latter will be described in this publication and permits a controlled
DAR of 4 (for IgG1, possessing four disulfide bridges) either as full
mAb (LHHL) or as half antibodies (LH) maintained together by weak
bonds (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Site-Specific Bioconjugation Using Rebridging Technology
The first step is the
reduction
of interchain disulfide bridges; then, the rebridging step is achieved
by using a linker with a next-generation maleimide bioconjugation
head.

The maleimide is often used to produce
ADCs but it can present
a loss of drug in the bloodstream through a retro-Michael reaction17 as observed in Adcetris. In contrast, substituted
maleimides such as dithiomaleimide (DTM) or dibromomaleimide (DBM)
enable better stability.16 Several substitution
patterns were described in the literature14,18 and we sought to explore the impact of this substitution in term
of bioconjugation reaction and final ADC characteristics. In this
work, we describe the synthesis of three linkers with different heads
of bioconjugation: DBM, DTM, and mixed thio-bromomaleimide (TBM) heads.
Corresponding ADCs were synthesized and evaluated both physicochemically
and biologically.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Linkers
Linkers were designed to be sensitive
to cathepsin B (Val-Cit-PABC trigger) and carry the monomethyl auristatin
E (MMAE) cytotoxic payload, a representative combination of ADC linkers
currently in clinical trials. In order to obtain the final linkers,
bioconjugation heads were synthesized as caproic acid derivatives
to allow them to be coupled to the commercial Val-Cit-PABC-MMAE motif.

The reaction between maleic anhydride and 6-aminocaproic acid in
acetic acid to obtain 6-maleimidocaproic acid 1 proceeded
nicely (Scheme 2).
Then, acid 1 was reacted, in a sealed tube, with bromine
in acetic acid to obtain dibromomaleimido-aminocaproic acid 2a, which was used to synthesize the two other heads. According
to the equivalents of thiophenol used, conversion of compound 2a, in basic conditions, led to both compounds 2b and 2c with excellent to poor yields because of purification
difficulties. Finally, a peptide coupling was performed between compounds 2a–c and the commercially available trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) salt of H2N-Val-Cit-PABC-MMAE to afford, after
purification by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), the final linkers 3a–c in moderate to
good yields.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 3a–c Next-Generation
Maleimide Linkers
Bioconjugation Reaction and Analysis
Trastuzumab (TTZ)
was used as an mAb model for our study. It targets HER2 protein and
is currently used in Kadcyla, one of the five approved ADCs on the
market. It has four disulfide bridges, hence with the linkers 3a–c a DAR of 4 is expected, the optimal DAR value
with the MMAE toxin.10

The bioconjugation
of the final linkers 3a–c with trastuzumab was
achieved in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or borate buffer saline
(BBS) after the reduction of its interchain disulfide bridges with
TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine)hydrochloride, a mild-reducing
agent, to afford ADCs 4a–c.

The bioconjugation
of ADCs 4a and 4b was
performed as previously described16,19 and gave satisfactory
average DAR (Table 1). Starting from the conditions used for the linker 3a, the bioconjugation of linker 3c allowed the obtention
of the ADC 4c but with a low average DAR of 1.2 calculated
by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). Hence, the bioconjugation
of 3c was optimized thanks to a systematic screening
of parameters in order to obtain an optimal ADC 4c (Scheme 3). Primarily, different
organic solvents, miscible with aqueous buffers, were tested: dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), and 1,4-dioxane. The use of DMF showed a slight increase of
the average DAR with an average DAR of 1.7 in HIC compared to 1.2
with DMSO and 1.3 with 1,4-dioxane. DMF was chosen as the organic
solvent for the future reactions. Then, the reaction time with the
linker was increased from 1 to 5 h, but no improvement of the average
DAR was observed. A reaction at a lower temperature, for example,
4 °C, was tested, leading to a decrease of the average DAR from
1.7 to 1.3. The reaction was not tested at 37 °C because of aggregation
and deamidation risks at high temperatures.20 The temperature was set to 20 °C and the linker equivalents
were increased (from 8 to 15). It allowed an improvement of the DAR
up to 2.7. Published conditions for bioconjugation of linker 3b consists in a double bioconjugation sequence: the protocol
of reduction followed by bioconjugation was done twice.19 Nevertheless, no positive impact on the average
DAR was observed but a greater increase of linker equivalents (up
to 30) led to an average DAR of 3.6. However, increasing the linker
equivalents without changing its concentration induced a high percentage
of organic solvent, which translated in the aggregation of the ADC.
Hence, we decided to concentrate the solution of the linker from 1
to 2 mM in order to limit the aggregation, and this alternative permitted
to reduce insoluble aggregates while improving the average DAR to
3.7. With these conditions in hand, a last step of optimization was
conducted. The reaction time with the linker was increased (from 1
to 3 h) and the ADC 4c was obtained with an optimal average
DAR of 4.0 without insoluble aggregates (Table 1).

20 °C; 3 h	4.0	72	
To summarize, linker 3a required a shorter
time of
reaction (only 3 h) but needed magnetic stirring to get a satisfactory
average DAR, whereas linker 3b requires almost 2 days
of reaction to achieve a lower average DAR. It is noted that shorter
times of reaction are correlated with higher temperatures. Double
addition of TCEP and a linker was beneficial only for ADC 4b. Furthermore, the nature of the organic solvent was important. Indeed,
the use of DMSO with bromide containing linker 3c was
detrimental for the average DAR. ADC 4c was obtained
with a short time of reaction but a higher quantity and an increased
concentration of linker were needed to get the targeted average DAR
of 4.0 (Table 1).

The optimization of these bioconjugations has permitted to obtain
the three ADCs 4a–c with a good percentage of
DAR 4 species, a satisfactory average DAR, and good yields. We compared
the DAR distribution of ADCs 4a–c using HIC analysis
(Figure 1a). The profile
of ADC 4b shows a higher heterogeneity of species than 4a and 4c. These latter ADCs (4a and 4c) are more homogeneous with a high proportion
of DAR 4 (71 and 81% respectively) and with less than 5% of poorly
loaded species (below DAR 3). However, ADC 4a has a higher
percentage of DAR 5, which could be explained by a less-efficient
rebridging or an additional noncovalent interaction between a linker
and the covalent DAR 4 ADC.

of each ADC by
HIC. Proportions are expressed as percentage of area under the curve
(AUC). (b) Monomeric percentage of each ADC by SEC. (c) Repartition

It was also noted from the electrospray ionization–mass
spectrometry (ESI–MS) analysis (see Figure S8 in the Supporting Information) that despite the expected
same resulting ADCs, the rebridging of ADC 4b is less
effective (Figure 1c). Indeed, it was noticed that this ADC exhibited a lot of different
fragments, after the denaturation induced by the ionization, with
various loadings. Different fragments were observed, LHHL DAR 2-3-4,
LHH DAR 0-1-2-3-4, and LH DAR 1-2, leading to lower average DAR per
fragments. These results are consistent with the lower average DAR
observed by HIC. ADCs 4a and 4c have similar
ESI–MS profiles with less fragments found. It is noteworthy
that a majority of LHHL DAR 4 and LH DAR 2 species (see Figures S7
and S9 in the Supporting Information) were
obtained. The presence of LH DAR 2 could be explained by an intrachain
instead of the interchain rebridging (Scheme 1).21

Finally,
we compared the proportion of monomer of each ADC with
an size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis (Figure 1b). ADCs 4b and 4c have a high percentage of monomer, which implies that the
bioconjugation conditions used to produce them were mild and that
they do not possess a strong propensity for aggregation. For ADC 4a, more high-molecular-weight species are observed (see Figure
S2 in the Supporting Information) which
can be due to the mechanical stirring during bioconjugation.

Stability of ADCs
Tests of stability, upon storage
in PBS pH 7.4 without formulation, were performed for each ADC for
4 weeks at 4 °C, after purification by size exclusion using a
PD-10 desalting column. Critical attributes evaluated were the average
DAR, the percentage of DAR 4, and of monomeric species. First, the
stability of the average DAR was evaluated by HIC (Figure 2a) and it was constant for
all ADCs during these 4 weeks.

Figure 2 Stability of each ADC upon storage in
PBS pH 7.4 without formulation
for 4 weeks at 4 °C. (a) Stability by HIC in terms of average
DAR for each ADC. (b) Stability by SEC in terms of percentage of monomer
for each ADC. (c) Stability by HIC in terms of DAR species for 4a. (d) Stability by HIC in terms of DAR species for 4b. (e) Stability by HIC in terms of DAR species for 4c.

The proportion of each species was analyzed for
the ADCs 4a–c (Figure 2c–e). It was notable that even if
the average DAR is
steady, the proportion of the different species varied over time.
ADCs 4a and 4b showed less variations than
ADC 4c. Indeed, ADC 4c presented a rapid
decrease of its DAR 4 in favor of DAR 5. The nature of this DAR 5,
observed with several different bioconjugation heads,13,19,22 still needs a full understanding
and characterization. The proportions of each DAR species appeared
then to be the least steady over time for ADC 4c.

As shown previously, the percentage of monomer of the ADCs 4a–4c is high and no major modification of the aggregation
was observed over 4 weeks (Figure 2b).

Proteins are highly complex molecules necessitating
extensive formulation
development, which is even more tricky when a hydrophobic payload
is conjugated. The formulation is different for each commercial ADC;
however, the trend is for slightly acidic buffer of low ionic strength
with polysorbates.23 Our stability profile
in PBS 1× Gibco is satisfying considering the pH of 7.4, the
ionic strength superior at 150 mM, and the lack of stabilizing polysorbates.

ELISA Assays
As expected,14 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis (Figure 3c) demonstrated no difference
in HER2-affinity for the three ADCs; similar Kd values (Figure 3d) were obtained in the same range as the native TTZ and the commercial
T-DM1, used as controls.

(HER2 negative cell line) and (b) BT-474 (HER2 positive cell line).

Cytotoxicity Assays
The cytotoxicity of the ADCs was
evaluated in vitro on MCF-7 (HER2 negative cell line from adenocarcinoma)
and BT-474 (HER2 positive cell line from ductal carcinoma). The ADCs
were compared to native TTZ, clinical treatment T-DM1, and MMAE (Figure 3a,b). The three ADCs
demonstrated no cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cell lines, whereas the MMAE
alone had a powerful cytotoxic effect on these cells (IC50 = 0.35 nM). ADCs 4a–c demonstrated excellent
cytotoxicity on the BT-474 cell line, even better than the clinical
treatment T-DM1 at lower concentrations. The cytotoxicity of ADCs 4a and 4c is equivalent to the control MMAE;
the cytotoxicity of ADC 4b is slightly less potent, which
could be imputed to its lower average DAR. However, IC50 values for ADCs 4a–c are all in a low nanomolar
range (Figure 3d).
These results demonstrate that our ADCs are specific to HER2-positive
cells and at least as efficient in vitro as the clinical reference
T-DM1.

Conclusions
The purpose of this work was to design
a new rebridging maleimide
head having a combination of advantages of DBM and DTM heads without
their drawbacks. The DBM permitted a high percentage of the wanted
DAR 4 with an ease of implementation of the bioconjugation but is
also associated with a higher percentage of DAR 5. As for the DTM,
it allowed a diminution of the DAR 5 species but the overall distribution
is more heterogeneous. Its bioconjugation needed a longer time of
reaction than DBM. The DTM brick led to a better percentage of monomer
than DBM probably because of a milder stirring during the bioconjugation
reaction. Our hypothesis was that the designed TBM brick would combine
the properties and advantages of the DBM and DTM. Thanks to this design,
a high percentage of DAR 4 (even greater than with DBM) was obtained
in a short reaction time as for the DBM. No aggregation was observed
with the TBM head either. This is in agreement with the hypothesis
that the bromide is a better leaving group than the thiophenolate,
probably because of its reduced steric hindrance. Even if, on small
proteins, it is described that the kinetic is similar for both,24 the more hindered antibody might react faster
with a small leaving group. Hence, we think that the bromide reacts
first and ensures good reactivity, which reduces considerably the
reaction time of the bioconjugation process. In a second time, the
slower reaction of the hindered thiophenol part permitted to temper
the reactivity of the head in order to increase the proportion of
DAR 4 and to keep a high percentage of monomer. All three ADCs conserved
good HER2 binding and a high cytotoxic effect on HER2-positive cell
lines only. Taken together, these results show that the TBM brick
is an attractive alternative scaffold for rebridging bioconjugation.

growth medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 100
μg/mL l-glutamine, 100 μg/mL penicillin G sodium,
100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate) and plated at a density of at
least 10 000 cells/cm2 in 150 cm2 cell
culture flasks. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2 for at least 1 week. Then, cells
were harvested and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.25 to
2.5 × 103 cells/well for cytotoxicity assays. Cells
were incubated 48 h at 37 °C prior to addition of the test molecules
and selected comparison compounds and vehicle (if DMSO, final concentration
did not exceed 0.5%).
