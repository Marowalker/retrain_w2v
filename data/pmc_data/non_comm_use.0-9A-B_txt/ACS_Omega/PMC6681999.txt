In this study, sodium titanium phosphate/reduced porous
graphene oxide (NTP/rPGO) composites are used as novel electrode materials
for hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI). The composites are synthesized
through assembling the NaTi2(PO4)3 precursor with etched graphene oxide under hydrothermal condition.
The NTP/rPGO composites demonstrate a porous hierarchical structure,
where uniformly dispersed NaTi2(PO4)3 particles are attached on the rPGO sheets, which provide abundant
adsorption sites, highly conductive networks, and short diffusion
lengths for salt ions. Benefiting from the redox reaction of the NTP
and electrical double-layer capacity of the rPGO, the NTP/rPGO composite
containing 77 wt % NaTi2(PO4)3 presents
a high specific capacity of 396.42 F g–1 and a high
electrosorption capacity of 33.25 mg g–1 at the
voltage of 1.4 V with the initial salt conductivity of 1600 μS
cm–1 (786 mg L–1). Further, it
also shows excellent recycling stability and rapid desalination rate
of 0.30 mg g–1 s–1 (100 times
as fast as the bare graphene electrode). Therefore, the NTP/rPGO composites
exhibit a promising prospect for desalination application in the HCDI
system.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Recently, the ever-increasing
demand for fresh water is a huge challenge due to population explosion,
industrial consumption, and environmental contamination. This encouraged
the rapid development of water desalination technologies in a cost-effective
and energy-efficient direction.1,2 However, current technologies
used in the desalination (e.g., reverse osmosis and thermal distillation)
exhibit obvious drawbacks, such as high energy consumption, secondary
pollution, and high operation costs.3−5 Instead, capacitive deionization (CDI), known as
electrosorptive desalination, is considered as a cost-effective desalination
method due to its easy operation, low energy consumption, and high
sustainability.6−9 However, the CDI still faces some intrinsic
limitations. Salt ions can only store at the surface of the electrodes
based on the electrical double layer (EDL) mechanism.10,11 In addition, counterions can be straightly adsorbed on the opposite
electrode when a reversed voltage is applied for the electrode regeneration.12 To improve the desalination capacity for the
practical application, a variety of derivation CDI techniques such
as membrane capacitive deionization,13,14 ion-exchange
resin-coated CDI,15 flow-electrode capacitive
deionization,16,17 inverted capacitive deionization,18,19 desalination batteries,20,21 and hybrid capacitive
deionization (HCDI)22 have been proposed.
Among them, the HCDI shows an excellent deionization capacity compared
to the conventional CDI and have attracted much attention.

As
an asymmetric system, the HCDI consists of two types of electrodes:
a capacitive electrode from conventional CDI system and a redox electrode
from battery desalination system. In detail, the capacitive electrode
shares the same mechanism for ion storage with supercapacitors. Therefore,
carbon materials for the EDL capacitive electrode require high surface
area, proper pore size distribution, enough surface wettability, and
high conductivity.23 To achieve these properties,
various carbide materials have been investigated for capacitive deionization,
such as activated carbon (AC),24,25 carbon aerogel,26,27 carbon nanotube,28,29 carbon nanosheet,30 and graphene.31−33 On the other hand, the salt ions can be stored through
the redox reaction in the battery-type electrode, which contributes
to the high electrical capacity and desalination capacity, like Ag-coated
carbon,34 Co3O4,35 Na4Mn9O18,22 and Na4Ti9O20.36 Given that Na+ is the main
ion in the seawater, the electrodes for sodium-ion batteries are expected
to be applied in the HCDI system. Huang et al. applied the NaTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite for electrochemical
deionization, exhibiting high removal capacity of 27 mg g–1.37 However, slow reaction kinetics of
intercalation can lead to a low desalination rate. Increase in the
content of porous carbon in the NaTi2(PO4)3 composites is a promising way to solve this issue. In addition,
the porous conductive structure in the battery-type electrode can
also enhance the electron conductivity and accommodate volume variation
during the desalination process.

To modify the aforementioned
problems, a suitable conductive substrate is highly expected to compose
electrode materials. Due to the high specific surface area, superior
mechanical property, and electrochemical performance, graphene (or
reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) is intensively studied as an energy-storage
material.38 Some researchers attempted
to create nanoholes on the graphene sheets to improve the electrochemical
performance of the supercapacitors. For example, Xu et al. synthesized
the porous graphene oxide (PGO) with abundant in-plane nanopores via
a convenient defect-etching reaction, which showed excellent rate
capabilities and cycling stability.39 Therefore,
the PGO sheets serving as building blocks provide a unique platform
for designing novel electrode materials. To further improve the conductivity,
a strategy is to design two-dimensional graphene sheets for the porous
three-dimensional (3D) substrate, which is appealing to facilitate
ion/electron migration and release volume change during the desalination
process.

In this study, a porous 3D NaTi2(PO4)3/reduced porous graphene oxide (NTP/rPGO) composites
are fabricated via a hydrothermal method, followed by carbonization
treatment, where the sodium titanium phosphate (NTP) particles are
uniformly dispersed in the rPGO sheets. The hierarchical structure
provides abundant adsorption sites and short diffusion lengths for
salt ion transfer. An HCDI cell using the NTP/rPGO and activated carbon
(AC) is assembled in this work, and desalination performances based
on different electrochemical potentials, flow rates, and initial salt
concentrations are also discussed in detail.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of the PGO and the NTP
First, GO was prepared with a modified Hummer method.40 Afterward, a typical synthesis route of the
PGO is described as follows: 5 mL of H2O2 (Beijing
Chemical Works, 30%) aqueous solution was mixed with 50 mL of GO aqueous
suspension (solid content of 2 mg mL–1), and then
the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 2 h. After centrifuging
and washing steps to remove the residual H2O2, the mixture was dispersed in deionized water again to form a homogeneous
PGO aqueous suspension, and the solid content was controlled to be
2 mg mL–1.

Two millimolar of sodium acetate
(CH3COONa, Beijing Chemical, ≥99.0%) and 2 mmol
of titanium butoxide (Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4, Tianjin Damao Chemical, ≥99.0%)
were dissolved into 6 mL of phosphorous acid (H3PO3, Beijing Chemical, 85%) solution and 40 mL of ethanol solvent,
respectively. The mixture was mixed and then transferred into a 100
mL Teflon-lined autoclave for solvothermal reaction for 3 h at 160
°C. After cooling down to room temperature, the white product
was washed with deionized water using centrifugation treatment. To
stabilize the NTP precursor, the product was dispersed in deionized
water again. When using for further steps, the NTP nanoparticles were
obtained by drying at 80 °C and annealing at 700 °C for
2 h in N2 flow.

2.2 Synthesis of the NTP/rPGO
NTP precursor, 0.2 g, without
annealing treatment was added to the obtained PGO suspension (50,
75, and 100 mL, respectively) by magnetic stirring and ultrasonic
treatment. Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined
autoclave for hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 12 h. After
washing, the gel-like product was freeze-dried and then annealed at
700 °C for 2 h in N2 flow. The obtained NTP/rPGO composites
were denoted as NTP/rPGO-1, NTP/rPGO-2, and NTP/rPGO-3, respectively,
according to different volumes of the rPGO suspension (from low to
high).

2.3 General Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized by scanning electron
microscope (SEM, JSM7800F JEOL) and transmission electron microscope
(TEM, HT7700 Hitachi). The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray
powder diffraction (XRD, advance D8 Bruker) using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the 2θ range
from 5 to 90°. The chemical information of the structure was
characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR,
PerkinElmer Spectrum RX1). Raman test was measured at room temperature
using a Renishaw in Via Raman system equipped with a 514 nm laser
source. Thermal stability of the samples was analyzed using a thermogravimetry
(TGA)/differential scanning calorimetry analyzer (Mettler Toledo)
under air atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured
at 77 K (SPECTOMETER 1990, American Thermo), and the surface areas
were calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method.

2.4 Electrochemical
Test
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using an electrochemical
workstation (Zennium, ZAHNER-elektrik), and a three-electrode system
with 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as an electrolyte
was used here. The NTP/rPGO and activated carbon (AC) were used as
working electrodes; a platinum plate and a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) were employed as a counter electrode and a reference electrode,
respectively. The specific capacity (Cs) was calculated according to eq 1 1  where A is the integral area in the CV curve, v is the scan rate (mV s–1), ΔV is the potential window (V), and m is
the loading mass (g) of active materials.

The deionization test
was conducted in a recycling system, consisting of a self-made HCDI
cell,41 a conductometer (DDSJ-308A, Feilo
Co., Ltd.), a peristaltic pump (BT100-2J, Longer Precision Pump Co.,
Ltd), and an Arbin battery test system. A typical electrode slurry
was prepared by mixing active materials, acetylene black (Pengxiang
Yunda Tech. CO., LTD., ≥99.7%), and poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(Shanghai Aladdin, 60.0%) in a mass ratio of 80:15:5. The active mass
loading for each electrode is about 200 mg, with the coating area
of 4 × 6 cm2. NaCl aqueous solution with initial conductivity
of 100–1600 μS cm–1 (or initial concentration
of 49–786 mg L–1, which mimics that of the
seawater) was circularly pumped into the HCDI cell at different flow
rates (20–40 mL min–1) under constant potentials
(1.0–1.4 V). The feeding volume and the solution temperature
were maintained at 200 mL and 25 °C, respectively. The electrosorption
capacity (Sc) of the electrode was calculated
according to eq 2 2  where C0 (mg L–1) and Cf (mg L–1) are the initial and the final
concentrations of NaCl solution, respectively; V (L)
is the volume of NaCl solution; and m (g) is the
total active mass of both electrodes.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Structural Characterization
Figure 1 illustrates
the synthesis process of the NTP/rPGO composites. The PGO was prepared
by the mild defect-etching reaction, and then assembled with the NTP
precursor to produce the NTP/PGO by the hydrothermal reaction. After
pyrolysis, the porous NTP/rPGO composites were obtained. The morphology
of the synthesized samples is investigated by SEM and TEM. As displayed
in Figure 2a,b, the
rPGO flakes show a porous structure due to the defect-etching reaction.
The wrinkled flakes of the graphene are interconnected to construct
the 3D network. Herein, the rPGO sheets were expected to serve as
a highly conductive substrate. Figure 2c shows the NTP nanoparticles with a narrow size range
from 50 to 100 nm. The very regular shape (parallelepiped) implies
the well-crystallized structure. As shown in Figure 2d–f, the NTP nanoparticles are well
dispersed and attached by rPGO sheets in the NTP/rPGOs. Compared to
the bare NTP, NTP nanoparticles in the NTP/rPGO show a smaller average
particle size of ∼60 nm. As shown in Figure 2g–i, the TEM images indicate that
the NTP nanoparticles are uniformly attached on the rPGO sheets. They
were closely anchored on the rPGO sheets. Interestingly, the hollow
structure can be observed in some NTP particles. It is worth noting
that such composite structure can increase the electrolyte/electrode
contact area and facilitate the electronic and ionic transport.42

composites.

SEM and (h) TEM images of the NTP/rPGO-2; and (f) SEM and (i) TEM
images of the NTP/rPGO-3.

Figure 3a presents the XRD patterns of the NTP, rPGO, and NTP/rPGO.
A broad diffraction peak at ∼26° is found in the rPGO,
corresponding to the typical (002) graphite plane (d-spacing value of 3.75 Å). The bare NTP exhibits some narrow
diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.52, 20.28, 20.98, 24.30, 29.30,
and 36.68°, corresponding to (012), (104), (110), (113), (024),
(116), and (300) planes of well-crystallized rhombohedral structure,
respectively (space group: R3̅c (167), PDF no. 85-2265). After composting the rPGO, the NTP/rPGO
composites display the same crystal phase. No peaks from other impurity
phases are observed, suggesting that the NTP/rPGO composites are mainly
made of the single NaTi2(PO4)3 crystal
phase. TGA analysis was carried out in the air to determine the amount
of NaTi2(PO4)3 in the composites
(see Figure 3b). The
major mass loss occurs at the onset temperature of 600 °C, and
residual mass remains stable after 700 °C. Thus, the NaTi2(PO4)3 amounts at 800 °C in the
NTP/rPGO-1, NTP/rPGO-2, and NTP/rPGO-3 are calculated to be ∼83,
∼77, and ∼74 wt %, respectively.

Figure 3 Structural characterization for the NTP, rPGO, and NTP/rPGOs:
(a) XRD patterns, (b) TGA profiles, (c) Raman spectra, and (d) FTIR
spectra.

In addition,
Raman spectra are obtained to confirm the carbide structure. As displayed
in Figure 3c, two predominant
peaks from the rPGO can be observed at 1340 and 1596 cm–1, corresponding to the D (defeat) and G (graphite) bands, respectively.
Compared to the bare rPGO, the lower intensity ratios of D band to
G band (ID/IG) for NTP/rPGO suggest higher graphitization degree of composite
carbon.43 Besides, the bands at 990 and
1085 cm–1 are attributed to the characteristic symmetrical
and asymmetrical stretching in the NTP lattice. The band at 272 cm–1 originates from the translational vibration of Ti4+ ions and those at 306, 341, and 438 cm–1 are associated with (PO4)3–.44 The chemical composition of the synthesized
composites is analyzed by FTIR measurement. In Figure 3d, the bands at 3420 and 1620 cm–1 are ascribed to the stretching and bending vibrations of O–H,
which is from the residual hydroxyl groups in the rPGO sheets. The
characteristic band at 1226 cm–1 is attributed to
the stretching vibration of the PO4 units. The bands at
1022 and 572 cm–1 are ascribed to the P–O
bonds in the PO4 tetrahedra, while the bands at 997 and
644 cm–1 correspond to the Ti–O–Ti
bonds in the TiO6 octahedra.44 Interestingly, the NTP/rPGO composites display a new absorption
band at 780 cm–1, indicating the formation of the
Ti–O–C chemical bond. Combined with morphology results,
this finding confirms that the rPGO sheets and the NTP particles are
successfully bonded together in the NTP/rPGO composites.

To
determine the surface areas of porous composites, nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were analyzed by semiempirical fitting. As displayed in Figure 4a, all of the isotherms
exhibit typical IUPAC-IV isotherms (showing an obvious hysteresis
loop) and high N2 uptake, indicating a mesoporous structure.
According to the BET method, the specific surface area of the NTP/rPGO-1,
NTP/rPGO-2, and NTP/rPGO-3 are calculated to be 102.68, 129.34, and
146.14 m2 g–1, respectively.

Figure 4 Porous structure
of the NTP/rPGO-1, NTP/rPGO-2, and NTP/rPGO-3: (a) N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms and (b) pore size distributions.

The
increase in the specific surface area is due to the high amount of
porous rPGO. Figure 4b shows the pore size distribution calculated based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. The NTP/rPGO-1 and NTP/rPGO-2 show the narrow size distributions
at around 4.1 nm and a broad one at around 24.0 nm. However, the pore
size of NTP/rPGO-3 is mainly distributed at 2.4 nm, which is due to
the predominance of the in-plane pores with the increase of the rPGO
content. The overlapping pores size at 0.5–10.0 nm, to some
extent, can enhance the desalination capacity.45 Thus, the NTP/rPGO composites are appealing for the HCDI
application.

3.2 Electrochemical
Characterization and Deionization Test
To estimate the electrosorption
performance, CV tests were performed here to obtain the capacity of
the fabricated electrodes. Figure 5a–c displays the CV curves of the NTP/rPGO electrodes
at varying scan rates from 0.2 to 5 mV s–1 in 1
M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. At the scan rate
of 0.2 mV s–1, the redox peaks related to the deintercalation/intercalation
reaction of Na+ from/into the NTP/rPGOs are observed at
−0.76 and −0.84 V, corresponding to the redox reaction
of Ti4+/Ti3+ in the NTP/rPGO electrode: NaTi2 (PO4)3 + 2Na+ + 2e– ↔ Na3Ti2 (PO4)3. As the scan rates increase, the anodic and cathodic peaks move
toward the lower and higher potentials, respectively. However, the
peak intensity increases with a slight deviation with the increase
in scan rate, indicating that the high cyclic stability, which agrees
with the previous report.46 Furthermore,
the calculated specific capacities are displayed in Figure 5d. Among them, the NTP/rPGOs-2
electrode delivers high values at all scan rates. Typically, at the
scan rate of 0.2 mV s–1, the specific capacity of
the NTP/rPGO-1, NTP/rPGO-2, and NTP/rPGO-3 are 251.78, 396.42, and
341.42 F g–1, respectively. This is because the
NTP/rPGO-2 has a higher specific surface area than that of the NTP/rPGO-1
and a wider mesoporous distribution than that of the NTP/rPGO-3. It
not only increases the effective contact area between the electrode
and electrolyte but also provides more active sites and short diffusion
channels for ion transportation and storage, thus yielding a high
specific capacity.47 Here, as the negative
electrode material in the HCDI cell, Figure 5e shows the CV curves of the AC in a potential
window of −1.0–0 V (vs SCE). The approximately rectangular
shape can be observed at the scan rates from 2 to 20 mV s–1, which is a typical voltammogram for the EDL capacitor. Figure 5f gives EIS spectra
of the NTP and NTP/rPGOs. The NTP/rPGO samples have a relatively low
resistance than that of the NTP, i.e., the total resistance of the
NTP is ∼0.8 Ω, whereas that of the NTP/rPGO-2 decreases
to ∼0.3 Ω. This is ascribed to the fact that the rPGO
provides favorable pathways for the ion transfer in the electrolyte
and electrons in the electrode. Based on the superior performance
mentioned above, the NTP/rPGO-2 was chosen as the positive electrode
material in the HCDI system.

scan rates: (a) NTP/rPGO-1, (b)

composites; (e) CV profile of AC at different scan rates; (f) EIS
spectra of the NTP and NTP/rPGO composites.

As illustrated in Figure 6, the batch-mode experiment
for the HCDI system using the NTP|AC and the NTP/rPGO-2|AC was applied
to compare their desalination performance. Figure 7a presents conductivity change vs cycling
time of the NaCl solution with an initial concentration of 1600 μS
cm–1 (786 mg L–1) under 1.0, 1.2,
and 1.4 V, respectively. There is a drastic decrease in conductivity
at the beginning of the electrosorptive cycle due to large number
of salt ions adsorbed here. As cycling time goes on, the conductivity
tends to become constant because of the charge balance on the electrode
surface. The adsorption rate of the NTP/rPGO-2|AC cell also increases
with the increasing voltage (0.19, 0.23, and 0.30 mg g–1 s–1 at 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 V, respectively), which
is also evidenced by a rapid drop of the conductivity curves. It is
noteworthy that such adsorption rate is 100 times higher than that
of the bare graphene electrode.48 Furthermore,
the slope of the curve gradually increases as the applied voltage
gradually increases. The average ion adsorption rates of the NTP/rPGO-2
and NTP were calculated to be 0.30 and 0.14 mg g–1 s–1 at 1.4 V, respectively. Figure 7b compares the electrosorptive capacity of
the NTP with NTP/rPGO-2 at different voltages. The electrosorptive
capacities of the NTP/rPGO-2 (i.e., 33.25 mg g–1 at 1.4 V) are twice as high as these of the bare NTP.

this study, and the HCDI device is assembled using the NTP/rPGO electrode
and the AC electrode.

Figure 7 Influence of applied voltage: (a) the variation of the
NaCl solution
conductivity vs cycling time, and (b) the electrosorptive capacity
of the NTP and NTP/rPGO-2 at different applied voltages. The influence
of flow rate: (c) the curves of conductivity change vs time, and (d)
the electrosorptive capacity of the NTP and NTP/rPGO-2 at different
flow rates.

To investigate
the influence of flow rate on the desalination performance, the flow
rates were set to be 20, 30, and 40 mL min–1, while
200 mL of NaCl solution (initial conductivity of 1600 μS cm–1 or initial concentration of 786 mg L–1) was circularly pumped into HCDI cell under the constant voltage
of 1.4 V. As shown in Figure 7c,d, the electrosorptive capacities of the NTP and NTP/rPGO-2
at 20 mL min–1 are 15 and 33.25 mg g–1, respectively. The flow conductivity after reaching an electrosorption
equilibrium becomes higher as the flow rate increases. Obviously,
the high flow rate can result in a decrease in the desalination capacity,
and this is because a low flow rate provides enough time for ion transport
from a bulk flow to an electrode, especially at low current load.49,50 When enlarging the flow rate, the shorter residence time for the
unit volume of salt water inside the HCDI cell can result in a shorter
time for the ions to migrate toward the electrodes. Thus, this ion-transport
limitation decreases the electrosorptive capacity of the HCDI cell.

Beyond that, the NTP|AC and NTP/rPGO-2|AC cells were also performed
in the NaCl solution with various concentrations to reveal the relationship
between desalination capacity and initial conductivity. Figure 8a presents the electrosorption
capacitance vs equilibrium concentration. The result implies that
the higher initial conductivity can lead to a higher removal amount
of salt ions. The experimental data can be fitted by applying the
Langmuir model (eq 3)
and the Freundlich model (eq 4) for the NTP|AC and NTP/rPGO-2|AC system, respectively51 3   4  where qe (mg g–1) is
the amount of removed NaCl, Ce is the
equilibrium concentration (mg L–1), and qm (mg g–1) is the maximum
desalination capacity corresponding to the complete monolayer coverage,
and n is an empirical constant. kL and kF are the Langmuir
constant and the Freundlich constant, respectively. The parameters
of Langmuir and Freundlich models and regression coefficients are
listed in Table 1.
Based on the regression coefficient (R2), the Freundlich model fits the experimental data of the NTP/rPGO-2
better than the Langmuir model does. Thus, this indicates that the
multilayer absorption is the main adsorption mechanism for the NTP
and NTP/rPGO-2 electrodes during the electrosorption process. In general,
the Langmuir model and the Freundlich model are used in the chemical
adsorption and physical/chemical adsorption, respectively. The electrosorption
behavior of the NTP/rPGO-2 confirms the hybrid adsorption. Additionally,
the regeneration test on the NTP/rPGO-2 electrode was performed using
the NaCl solution with an initial conductivity of 1600 μS cm–1 (786 mg L–1) under the applied
voltage of 1.4 V. As shown in Figure 8b, the electrosorptive capacity of the HCDI system
remains almost unchanged (∼33 mg g–1) in
the initial ten electrosorption/desorption cycles. This stable behavior
is ascribed to the stable 3D porous structure of the NTP/rPGO, which
can not only prevent the aggregation of the NTP nanoparticles but
also offer continuous ion/electron pathway during the electrochemical
salt removal process. This further confirms that the NTP/rPGO-2 is
a promising HCDI electrode material.

Compared to previous reports
(see Table 2), the
electrosorption capacity of the NTP/rPGO-2 obtained in this study
is acceptable based on the initial NaCl concentration of 786 mg L–1. It is noteworthy that the electrosorption rate of
the NTP/rPGO-2 electrode (0.3 mg g–1 s–1) is superior. In sum, the superior desalination performances of
the NTP/rPGO can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) the 3D
porous graphene matrix with a high surface area and abundant channels
results in a fast salt ion migration and a high capacitive storage;
(2) the nanosized NTP loaded on the graphene matrix can boost the
reversible capacity and desalination capability, while the large open
space in the graphene matrix can accommodate the volume variation
of the NTP during the desalination process. Thus, this hybrid electrode
used in the HCDI system can lead to high ion removal capacity and
rate.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we prepare a series of the NTP/rPGO composites through
assembling the NTP precursor with porous graphene oxide by hydrothermal
method followed by carbonization treatment. Inside the composites,
the NTP particles are uniformly dispersed and attached on the rPGO
sheets, the latter serve as a conductive substrate. The synthesized
NTP/rPGO composites are employed as an electrode for the HCDI system.
The HCDI cell based on the NTP/rPGO-2|AC shows a high desalination
capacity of 33.25 mg g–1 at an applied potential
of 1.4 V with an initial salt conductivity of 1600 μS cm–1 (786 mg L–1). This is because the
dispersed NTP nanoparticles provide abundant sites for ion adsorption
based on the redox reaction. Furthermore, the rPGO sheets construct
a conductive 3D network, resulting in a high capacitive storage and
a low transient resistivity. Therefore, a rapid ion removal rate of
0.3 mg g–1 s–1 has been achieved
due to the hybrid electrodes and porous structure. Combining with
the excellent regeneration ability, the NTP/rPGO composites exhibit
promising properties as an electrode material for seawater desalination
in the future.
