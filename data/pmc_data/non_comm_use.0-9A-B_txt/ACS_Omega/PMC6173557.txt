Enzymes
are promising catalysts for bioprocessing. For instance,
the enzymatic capture of CO2 using carbonic anhydrase (CA)
is a carbon capture approach that allows obtaining bicarbonate (HCO3–) with no high-energy input required. However,
application in a commercially viable biotechnology requires sufficient
enzymatic lifetime. Although enzyme stabilization can be achieved
by different immobilization techniques, most of them are not commercially
viable because of transport limitations induced by the immobilization
method. Therefore, it is necessary to develop assays for evaluating
the role of immobilization on transport limitations. Herein, we describe
the development of a fast and reproducible assay for screening immobilized
CA by means of absorbance measurement using a computer-controlled
microplate reader in stop–flow format. The automated assay
allowed minimizing the required volume for analysis to 120 μL.
We validated the assay by determining lag times and activities for
three immobilization techniques (modified Nafion, hydrogels, and enzyme
precipitates), of which linear polyethyleneimine hydrogel showed outstanding
performance for CA immobilization.

==== Body
Introduction
Bioprocessing has been an expanding field
over the last couple
of decades with increasing industrial use, including in the pharmaceutical
industry, biofuels industry, and bioremediation.1 Most bioprocessing is subdivided between cell-based and
cell-free bioprocessing. Cell-free bioprocessing has lagged behind
cell-based bioprocessing because of stability issues of the enzymes
utilized, and the need for immobilizing them on a support for flow-through
reactors. Furthermore, besides the bioprocessing field, enzymes have
gained critical importance for different clinical and biosensing applications.2 A wealth of new techniques for immobilizing and
stabilizing enzymes have been demonstrated,3 which are typically evaluated with specific activity assays, protein
leaching assays for evaluating immobilization, and long-term activity
assays for evaluating stability. These assays provide proof-of-concept
knowledge about the effectiveness of the immobilization techniques.
However, no information about whether the technique can be used in
an industrial reactor is obtained, because they do not address transport
limitations that are frequently introduced by the immobilization technique.
Additionally, the majority of these assays are not automated, or introduce
variables, such as the response time of a pH electrode or the need
of temperature control to slow the reaction rate. Therefore, in this
paper, we detail an automated stop–flow spectrophotometric
assay that can be performed at room temperature for evaluating transport
limitation in enzyme immobilization systems.

Carbonic anhydrase
(CA) was utilized as our model enzyme. CA (EC
4.2.1.1) is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme, which catalyzes the reversible
hydration of CO2 with uncommonly high turnover rate, up
to 106 per second,4 according
to the following reaction: 1  

CAs have an apparent
molecular weight of 29–55 kDa. Naturally,
CAs contribute to several biological processes such as acid–base
balance, carbon dioxide transport, ureagenesis, photosynthesis, and
they are produced by different tissues. The use of CA as a biological
catalyst for capturing CO2 is an extremely interesting
approach, which would minimize excessive energy requirements. Furthermore,
the development of a biotechnology based on an enzymatic catalyst
to convert CO2 directly to bicarbonate (HCO3–) does not require high-energy input at all. Immobilization
techniques have been shown to greatly increase the stability and lengthen
the half-life of different enzymes,5 including
CA.6 However, performance can be strongly
affected by transport limitations because of the very high turnover
rate of CA. It is easy to be limited by transport of reactant and/or
product within the immobilization matrix, if the immobilization technique
retards transport. Thus, CA is a promising candidate to be used as
a model enzyme in this study.

The catalytic activities of CAs
are usually determined using a
pH assay, known as the Wilbur–Anderson (W–A) assay,
which relies on the change in pH obtained because of an increase in
H+ concentration as indicated in eq 1, when the reaction proceeds to equilibrium.7 However, the W–A assay requires temperature
control to slow the reaction rate and allow for pH monitoring. Accordingly,
the assay is commonly performed maintaining the temperature between
0 and 4 °C. Moreover, as a fast response is needed, the employed
pH electrode must have a short response time and small dimensions
to contain the volume for the assay at a reasonable amount. CA activity
can also be measured by spectrophotometric analysis, following the
increase of absorbance at 348 nm using p-nitrophenyl
acetate as an alternative substrate for the enzyme, with no temperature
control required.8 Because of the uncommonly
high turnover of CA, however, this analysis does not allow us to differentiate
between activity losses because of denaturation or limiting the degrees
of freedom of the enzyme and apparent activity losses because of slow
transport of reactant and/or product over long length scales in the
immobilization matrix.

Inspired by the possibility to measure
CA activity by spectrophotometric
analysis, herein, a spectrophotometric assay was developed, which
determined the catalytic activity by remote control, minimizing the
reaction volume to 120 μL at ambient temperature and ensuring
a controlled time between substrate injection and absorbance measurement
for lag-time-based transport-limitation studies. Furthermore, the
Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader utilized for the assay allows temperature
control up to 50 °C, thus being applicable also for catalytic
activity studies of thermophilic enzymes. The influences on activity
and lag-time performances for three immobilization techniques were
determined, specifically magnetically separable enzyme precipitate
coating (Mag-EPC),9 linear polyethyleneimine
(LPEI) hydrogels,10 and tetrabutylammonium
bromide (TBAB)-modified Nafion.11 The lag
time assay allows for the determination of the time it takes substrate
to get to the immobilized enzyme, the substrate to react,
and the product to diffuse away. Therefore, if the immobilization
technique retards transport or requires long transport distances to
the enzyme, the lag time will be significantly larger than if there
is facile diffusion and a short diffusion length to the enzyme. It
has to be noted that the immobilization strategies were specifically
chosen as model immobilization systems. We expect TBAB-Nafion immobilization
strategies to decrease activity because of the polymer being dense
and retarding transport. In the case of the Mag-EPC immobilization
system, the use of the cross-linker will likely decrease the activity
of the CA. Immobilization with LPEI hydrogel was selected because
of the polymer’s highly cationic polyamine backbone, being
largely protonated under neutral conditions,12 which might establish a favorable interaction with the anionic surface
of the immobilized enzyme.

Results and Discussion
Representative
absorbance increases investigated using the developed
time-dependent spectrophotometric assay for free CA in solution, CA
immobilized in LPEI hydrogels, CA immobilized via Mag-EPC, and in
TBAB-modified Nafion are shown in Figure 1 (see the Methods section for spectrophotometric assay and preparation details). The
evolution over time of the absorbance was determined versus the results
obtained in the control experiment, where no enzyme was present (Figure 1, black dots). It
has to be noted that the enzyme dynamics might be influenced differently
in every replicate because of the immobilization step, making it of
critical importance to perform several independent replicate experiments.
Accordingly, four independent replicate experiments were performed
for all the cases under investigation, allowing for the determination
of activity and lag times (Figures 2 and 3, respectively).

assay for free CA in solution (A), CA immobilized in LPEI hydrogels

techniques (LPEI,
TBAB-Nafion, and Mag-EPC) and for the enzyme in solution.

Figure 3 Lag-time results for the three immobilization techniques
(LPEI,
TBAB-Nafion, and Mag-EPC) and for the enzyme in solution.

As expected, the free enzyme in solution retained
the highest activity
(Figure 2), with 16.9
± 0.4 units × 10 mg enzyme–1. Immobilization
using LPEI resulted in the smallest loss of enzyme activity, obtaining
a value of 11.7 ± 0.2 units × 10 mg enzyme–1. LPEI is a biocompatible hydrogel, so it is expected that it would
not confine the enzyme or retard transport. On the contrary, immobilization
using TBAB-Nafion and Mag-EPC caused a significant loss in activity,
with values of 6.1 ± 0.7 and 6.4 ± 0.9 units × 10 mg
enzyme–1, respectively. However, the standard activity
assay does not differentiate whether the loss in activity is due to
retarded transport through a dense matrix or a decrease in activity
because of denaturation or decreased degrees of freedom during cross-linking
or encapsulation.

Utilizing an automated addition of substrate
with an absorbance
reading every 0.09 s, it was possible to determine the lag time for
the conversion of the substrate by CA immobilized with the three different
techniques and the free enzyme in solution. CA immobilized using LPEI
allowed achieving the lowest lag time as shown in Figure 3, requiring only 4.4 ±
0.4 s to initiate the conversion of the substrate. Free CA in solution
and Mag-EPC showed similar performances with lag times of 7.3 ±
0.7 and 7.6 ± 0.9 s, respectively. Immobilization with TBAB-modified
Nafion produced the lowest performances, with a lag time of 10.8 ±
0.3 s. The outstanding performances of LPEI-immobilized CA might be
related to the electrostatic interaction between the anionic surface
of the immobilized enzyme and the cationic polyamine backbone, which
allowed for maintaining the enzyme at the interface with the solution,
minimizing diffusion effects and possibly facilitating the diffusion
of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme. Further studies
will be required to specifically determine the origin of the decreased
lag time for CA immobilization in the LPEI polymeric layer. On the
contrary, when TBAB-modified Nafion was used for the immobilization,
the lowest activity was obtained together with the highest lag time.
A limited hydration of the dense Nafion polymeric layer might be responsible
for this performance, together with a local decrease of pH because
of protons’ retention inside the polymeric layer. In fact,
LPEI-based polymers have been reported to present a “proton
pump effect” because of the ability of corresponding cross-linked
films to exchange protons with the bulk solution.13 This effect might facilitate the fixation of carbon dioxide
inside the hydrogel, by removing the obtained protons and maintaining
the optimal environment for CA, which has been reported as slightly
alkaline for immobilized CA.6 On the contrary,
TBAB-Nafion does not present the “proton pump effect”;
thus, an increased concentration of protons inside the layer might
decrease the pH locally and inhibit the activity of CA. Mag-EPC-immobilized
CA showed a considerable loss of activity; however, a lag time similar
to the free enzyme in solution was obtained. This result can be explained
considering that, conversely from LPEI and TBAB-Nafion immobilization,
the Mag-EPC immobilization system does not introduce a polymeric layer
that can positively (or negatively) influence the transport of chemical
species, resulting in a lag time similar to the free enzyme. Taking
into consideration the extended lifetime reported for CA immobilized
in Mag-EPC with the half-life of 236 days, this immobilization would
be of extreme interest for application where recovery of the enzyme
is necessary, as the dispersed particles can be magnetically captured,
simplifying the recovery process.

The developed spectrophotometric
assay allowed an easy determination
of lag times and enzymatic activities at room temperature for the
three immobilization techniques. The two parameters together allowed
for a comprehensive evaluation of the influence of the different immobilizations
on the catalytic performances of CA, remarking on the role of the
hydrophilic properties and “proton pump” effect of LPEI
hydrogels for outstanding performance. Accordingly, the developed
spectrophotometric assay allowed a deeper insight of the catalytic
performances of CA in the three immobilization techniques than the
standard W–A assay. Moreover, the operational time required
for the W–A assay is much higher, making this assay not suitable
for an elevated number of samples. It has to be noted that a better
understanding of catalytic performance for immobilized enzymes is
critical both from a scientific point of view, in order to clarify
the specific influence of immobilization techniques on enzymatic response,
as well as for clinical, pharmaceutical, and other industries involved
in bioprocessing. Different immobilization techniques might be designed
for a better control of enzymatic cascade reactions depending on the
lag times for specific immobilized enzymes. Additionally, the developed
assay would benefit the field of biosensors, where lag times might
influence response time and lead to erroneous measurements.

Conclusions
The stop–flow spectrophotometric assay allowed for the easy,
fast, and reproducible determination of lag-time and catalytic activity
parameters of CA immobilized with different techniques. The assay
was performed at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C), with a reaction
volume of only 120 μL, which allowed for minimizing the amount
of immobilized enzyme and a consequent decrease of the assay cost.
Depending on the desired operational conditions, the three immobilization
techniques showed interesting features. LPEI hydrogels could be successfully
utilized to immobilize CA when fast CO2 fixation is required.
On the contrary, Mag-EPC can be successfully applied in long-term
experiments because of the remarkable half-life reported and comparable
lag times to free enzyme in solution. The developed assay will be
beneficial for the continuous development of enzymatic systems such
as the one presented here for CO2 fixation, as well as
for fundamental studies, which are critical for the successful development
of enzymatic biotechnology and their implementation in industrial
systems.

Methods
Chemicals
CA from bovine erythrocytes,
TBAB, p-nitrophenyl acetate, Nafion, acetonitrile,
poly(ethylene
glycol) diglycidyl ether, aniline, 3-aminobenzoic acid, glutaraldehyde,
and ammonium sulfate were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).
Sodium phosphate monobasic was purchased from Macron and sodium phosphate
dibasic from Fisher Chemicals.

CA Immobilization Techniques
Immobilization
by Mag-EPC
CA was immobilized on
carboxylated polyaniline nanofibers (cPANFs) via the approach of Mag-EPC,
as described elsewhere.9 Briefly, the carboxyl
groups of cPANF were modified by 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethlamino)propyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (10 mg mL–1) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (50 mg mL–1) in 100
mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH
6.0). A solution of CA (10 mg mL–1) in 100 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.6) was mixed with the modified cPANF and
incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, amine-functionalized
magnetic nanoparticles and ammonium sulfate were added to the mixture.
After 30 min of incubation, glutaraldehyde solution was added at a
final concentration of 0.5% (w/v), followed by the incubation at 4
°C for 17 h. Unreacted glutaraldehyde was quenched by 100 mM
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). After excessive washing, the Mag-EPC was
stored in 100 mM PB (pH 7.6) at 4 °C. The sample of Mag-EPC-immobilized
CA was diluted 33 times and 10 μL of the dispersion was added
to the well, for a final content of immobilized CA of 3 × 10–3 mg.

Immobilization on TBAB-Modified Nafion
TBAB-modified
Nafion was prepared by adding the TBAB to a 5% by weight Nafion suspension
as previously reported, and salt-extracting the excess TBAB and HBr.14 In a 500 μL tube, 1.5 mg of CA was added
to 75 μL of 100 mM PB (pH 7.6). Twenty-five microliters of the
TBAB-modified Nafion were added to the tube and mixed by vortex for
1 min. Subsequently, the suspension was sonicated for 15 min and diluted
50 times using 100 mM PB (pH 7.6). Ten microliters of the suspension
were added to the well and let to dry for 1 hour to ensure evaporation
of the solvent. The final content of immobilized CA was 3 × 10–3 mg.

Immobilization of LPEI Hydrogel
For the LPEI immobilization,
in a 500 μL tube, 14 μL of a 1% by weight LPEI suspension
(prepared as discussed in ref (12b)) was added to 6 μL of a 10 mg mL–1 solution of CA in 100 mM PB (pH 7.6). Subsequently, 0.75 μL
of a 10% by volume solution of poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether
was added to the tube and diluted 10 times using 100 mM PB (pH 7.6).
Ten microliters of the suspension were added to the well and let to
dry for 1 h to ensure evaporation of the solvent. The final content
of immobilized CA was 3 × 10–3 mg.

Activity and Lag-Time Spectrophotometric Assay
The
automated stop–flow spectrophotometric assay for enzyme catalytic
activity was developed using a microplate reader (Synergy HTX Multi-Mode
Reader, BioTek Instruments, Inc.). A 96-well plate is utilized for
enzyme immobilization during the assay, which allows for performing
independent replicate experiments simultaneously. Utilizing the BioTek
Gen5 2.07 data analysis software, the assay is designed to perform
substrate addition by remote control, measuring the increase in absorbance
every 0.09 s immediately after the additions. The assay does not require
maintaining the temperature at 0–4 °C to slow the reaction
rate, and can be executed directly at room temperature. The absorbance
can be monitored for the desired reaction time, depending on the enzyme
catalytic activity to be determined. Lag times are determined as the
time required before substrate conversion started (i.e., slope started
increasing, as shown in Figure 4), indicated by an increase of absorbance compared to the
control experiment performed in the absence of enzyme. Enzymatic activities
were calculated from the increase of absorbance per second as described
in the calculation section. A schematic for the assay procedure is
shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 (Left)
Schematic description of the spectrophotometric CA catalytic
activity assay; (right) schematic of the data analysis for the spectrophotometric
assay.

Specifically, in the case of CA
catalytic activity study, the absorbance
was monitored at 348 nm over 45 s of reaction time at room temperature
(20 ± 2 °C). The substrate utilized for the analysis was
60 mM p-nitrophenyl acetate (10.9 mg mL–1) in acetonitrile as solvent. Ten microliters of immobilized enzyme,
prepared as previously described, were placed for each well of the
96-well plate. All the samples were diluted to 100 μL using
PB (pH 7.6). Subsequently, 20 μL of substrate was added to the
well by means of a remote-controlled pump. After addition, the well
was immediately shaken for 2 s at 731 cycles-per-minute. Following
the shaking step, the absorbance at 348 nm was measured for 45 s.
All the analyses were performed with four replicates. The obtained
values of activity and lag time were compared to the results obtained
following the same procedure but using a solution of CA in 100 mM
PB (pH 7.6) (enzyme not immobilized).

Calculations
The
concentration of p-nitrophenyl acetate converted
was calculated using the Lambert–Beer
law:  where ε is the molar absorptivity constant
for p-nitrophenyl acetate at 348 nm (5400 M–1 cm–1), l is the length of the
cuvette (1 cm), Amin is the slope of the
absorbance per minute as obtained during the measurement, and c is the concentration of the product. The activity of the
enzyme is indicated as units × 10 mg enzyme–1, thus representing the amount of substrate in μmol, converted
by 10 mg of enzyme (immobilized or in solution).
