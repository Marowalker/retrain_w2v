Cross-linked microporous carbon beads
(MCBs) were successfully
synthesized via a green, convenient, and cost-efficient strategy derived
from a renewable sugar source. Such an approach avoids the time-consuming
procedure and the use of corrosive chemical activating agents and
toxic solvents and only involves a simple carbonization process, which
makes it to be applicable for rapid and large-scale industrial production
of MCB materials. The obtained MCBs possessed well-defined microporous
structure, narrow pore size, and high surface area. Particularly,
the microporosity of the resultant MCBs could be easily tailored to
arise primary pores of size 0.5–0.9 nm by adjusting the carbonization
temperature and reaction time, which remarkably favor the CO2 capture. The optimal sample of MCBs-9-5 carbonized at 900 °C
for 5 h was characterized by high microporosity (80% of the surface
area from micropores), especially ultrahigh narrow microporosity (53%
of pore volume from micropores of size <1 nm), which endowed it
a great satisfactory CO2 uptake of 4.25 mmol g–1 at 25 °C and 1 bar. Significantly, a prominent CO2/N2 selectivity and superior recyclability of MCBs-9-5
were also achieved. Combined with the simple fabrication, the satisfactory
adsorption capacity, and high selectivity, MCBs-9-5 should be a promising
adsorbent for CO2 capture and separation.

1 Introduction
Carbon
dioxide (CO2), as a primary greenhouse gas, has
increased dramatically in the last recent decades owing to the large-scale
burning of fossil fuels to meet the energy requirement of world, which
results in global warming and anthropogenic climate change, such as
the continuous rise of water level in sea, the increasing number of
ocean storms, and floods.1,2 Moreover, a high concentration
of CO2 is harmful to humans, especially in the space-limited
chambers such as submarines, space ships, and so on.3 Thus, it is urgent and significant for reducing atmospheric
CO2 concentrations to develop efficient CO2 capture
and sequestration. Up to now, many technologies have been employed
to separate and capture CO2, for example, chemical/physical
adsorption, membrane separation, solution adsorption, and cryogenic
separation. Among these strategies, adsorption using porous solid
adsorbents is the most promising technology because of their unique
advantages over other methods such as low cost, low energy consumption,
easy handling, and ease of applications.

The key of the adsorption
technology is developing a high-performance
CO2 adsorbent. Porous solid materials used for the CO2 capture mainly involve porous carbons, zeolites, amine-modified
mesoporous silica, metal–organic frameworks, porous organic
polymers, graphene-based composite adsorbents, and so on.4−8 Porous carbons, especially activated carbons, are regarded as one
of the most potential candidates for CO2 adsorption owing
to their high surface area, large pore volume, easy-to-tunable and
developed porosity, low preparation cost, stable physicochemical properties,
and low energy consumption for regeneration. However, traditional
activated carbons exhibit a relatively low CO2 adsorption
capacity of typically ca. 2–3 mmol g–1 under
room temperature at 1 bar.1,9 One efficient way of
improving CO2 capture capacity is to introduce basic sites
into the skeleton of carbon materials, as the basic sites are believed
to promote the interaction between CO2 molecules and carbon
surface. For this purpose, many efficient approaches have been developed
to design nitrogen-doped porous carbons, including postmodification
of anion on the carbon surface and incorporation of nitrogen groups
into carbon skeleton.10,11 Fan et al. synthesized nitrogen-doped
microporous carbons by a K2CO3 chemical activation
strategy using chitosan as a carbon precursor, which exhibited a high
CO2 uptake of 3.86 mmol g–1 at 25 °C,
1 bar.12 Wang et al. reported N-doped porous
carbon hollow spheres with a CO2 adsorption capacity of
2.96 mmol g–1 (25 °C, 1 bar) by using a melamine–formaldehyde
nanosphere as a hard template and a resorcinol–formaldehyde
resin as a carbon precursor.13 Unfortunately,
designing nitrogen-doping materials usually involves poisonous, expensive,
and corrosive raw materials, which can bring unexpected damage for
the environment and equipment, restricting their practical applications.14 Another way to enhance the CO2 capture
capacity is to design microporous carbons especially containing rich
and narrow micropores with a pore size of <1 nm.15,16 Wahby et al. synthesized petroleum pitch-derived carbon molecular
sieves with developed microporosity with a narrow micropore size of
0.35–0.7 nm by the KOH chemical activation method, which showed
an excellent CO2 uptake of 8.6 mmol g–1 (0 °C, 1 bar).17 Sevilla et al.
prepared microporous biomass-based carbon materials via KOH chemical
activation of hydrothermal carbons derived from mixtures of algae
and glucose, which possessed a large number of narrow micropores (<1
nm) and exhibited a satisfactory CO2 adsorption capacity
of 4.8 mmol g–1 (25 °C, 1 bar).18 These results demonstrate that microporous carbon
with a large proportion of narrow micropore size of <1 nm can efficiently
improve the CO2 capture capacity. However, the synthesis
of well-defined microporous carbons usually adopts the chemical activation
route using KOH, NaOH, H3PO4, and ZnCl2 as chemical activating agents, which is a time-consuming, step-tedious,
and costly process.19−22 Meanwhile, these synthetic strategies suffer some other drawbacks,
such as corrosion of the equipment, high energy consumption, and so
on. Therefore, from the viewpoint of practical applications, it still
remains a big challenge to design a more favorable ultramicroporous
carbon sorbent for CO2 capture not only with high performance
but also with environmental friendliness and cost-effectiveness.

Herein, we develop a green and cost-efficient strategy for preparing
cross-linking microporous carbon bead with large numbers of narrow
micropores (<1 nm). Compared with other reported methods, this
strategy only involves a simple heat treatment procedure and avoids
the use of chemical activating agents and toxic organic solvents;
meanwhile, it chooses inexpensive and renewable starch sugar as a
carbon source, which exhibits an important potential for fast and
large-scale preparation of microporous carbons to meet practical industrial
applications. The evolution of microporosity with different calcination
temperatures and reaction times was investigated. The optimal sample
with a high surface area of 1755.4 m2 g–1 and a large micropore surface area of 1444.9 m2 g–1 was obtained by directly carbonizing at 900 °C
for 5 h. As a CO2 adsorbent, the CO2 capture
capacity of the resultant materials is evaluated and the optimal sample
exhibits considerable CO2 adsorption capacities of 6.15
and 4.25 mmol g–1 under 0 and 25 °C at 1 bar,
respectively. Furthermore, such a CO2 adsorbent also shows
an outstanding recyclability and CO2/N2 selectivity
adsorption property.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material Characterizations
Cross-linked
microporous carbon beads (MCBs) were synthesized via an air-assisted
activated strategy without adding chemical activating agents and toxic
organic solvents, and the possible fabrication mechanism of MCB materials
is displayed in Scheme 1. Glucose-based carbon sphere precursors were the colloidal complex
mixture of organic compounds with an extremely low carbonization degree.
In the beginning stage, these CS precursors were easy to pyrolysis
at high temperature to bring a microporous structure with the release
of small molecules.24 Meanwhile, the colloidal
glucose-based precursors were converted into cross-linked carbon beads,
and the diameter of the bead reduced as a result of the structural
shrinkage.25 Subsequently, under the assistance
of air, some of the carbons in the skeleton were burned by O2 in the air to generate a promotive porosity and meanwhile released
CO2 during the process of carbon burning escaped through
the spherical carbon substrate, which also produced more micropores
and even enlarged pores. Moreover, some carbon substrates could react with CO2,
yielding CO whilst generate some fine micropores.26−28 Thus, the microporosity
of MCB materials is greatly dependent on the calcination temperature
and reaction time. In brief, the porosity of the resulting MCB materials
mainly derives from the incomplete burning of carbon taken in the
reaction process. Different annealing temperatures and reaction times
bring different degrees of carbon burning, resulting in the variation
of porosity.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of Probable Mechanism for the
Formation of
Cross-Linked MCBs
The influences of carbonization temperature and reaction
time on
the porosity of MCB materials were characterized by the N2 sorption technology. Figure 1a,b shows the relationship of the porosity of MCB samples
with carbonization temperature. It is clear that all samples present
a typical type I isotherm of the microporous structure (Figure 1a), and these micropores should
originate from the elimination of surface O- and H-groups during the
carbonization process.29 Notably, although
the isotherm of MCBs-10-3 can still be attributed to the type I curve,
the adsorbed N2 volume increases in a stepwise manner to
the high-pressure region, indicating the increase in the percentage
of mesopores in the total porosity of MCBs-10-3, which should be ascribed
to the elimination of more volatile substance under high heat treatment
temperature, resulting in the coalescence of some narrow micropores
to form some larger micropores and even small mesopores (2–3
nm). Such results can be demonstrated by the pore size distribution
in Figure 1b. For the
MCBs-7-3 sample, the micropores mainly center in 0.60 and 1.25 nm,
and micropores further develop to generate a multiscale microporosity
in MCBs-8-3 and MCBs-9-3 samples with an extra micropore of ∼0.83
nm, and MCBs-9-3 should possess a superior microporosity than that
of MCBs-8-3, which could be testified from the pore volume value.
With continuously increasing annealing temperature to 1000 °C,
most micropores of MCBs-10-3 enlarge to 1.25–1.58 nm and some
micropores even further enlarge to mesopores of 2.05 nm, bringing
the remarkable enhancement of mesoporosity (Table 1), which is consistent with the analytic
result of isotherm. As shown in Figure S1a (Supporting Information), the proportion of micropores progressively enhances
with the rise of temperature from 700 to 900 °C, in spite of
the degree of growth in the micropore proportion was slow, whereas
when the activation temperature rose to 1000 °C, the proportion
of mesopores in the MCBs-10-3 sample sharply increased and accordingly
the proportion of micropores in total pores noticeably declined. On
the basis of these results, it was easy to draw such a conclusion
that the carbonization temperature had a significant impact on the
evolution of microporosity and pore proportion in MCB materials.

Activation time
is another critical parameter for developing a
superior porosity, and the results are displayed in Figure 1c,d. Obviously, all N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms exhibit a typical type I
isotherm, representing a typical microporous structure (Figure 1c). The increase of N2 adsorbed quantity indicates the larger and larger surface area and
pore volume, and the adsorbed N2 volume gradually increases
at the high-pressure region with the prolonging of activation time,
suggesting the generation of enlarged micropores and even some mesopores. Figure 1d depicts the pore
distribution curves of all MCBs-9-y samples, and
it clearly shows the evolution process of the micropore size with
the increase of activation time. All MCBs-9-y samples
exhibit hierarchical narrow micropore size distributions of ∼0.48,
0.68, and 0.85 nm as well as a relatively large micropore of ∼1.25
nm. Noticeably, these hierarchical micropores further develop and
optimize with the prolonging of reaction time, and as the reaction
time progressively increases to 4 h, some new micropores of ∼1.48
nm begin to generate. When the reaction time continuously prolongs
to 6 h, such micropores of ∼1.25 and 1.48 nm dominates the
pore size, and even larger micropore of ∼1.86 nm are generated
in the MCBs-9-6 sample. Figure S1b analyzes
the proportion of micro-/mesopores from the surface area and pore
volume. Apparently, with the increase of reaction time from 1 to 3
h, the proportion of micropores retains a similar value of ∼89%
and then sharply declines as the reaction time increased from 4 to
6 h. A similar result can be drawn from the values of the micropore
surface area and micropore volume (Table 1), and when the reaction time exceeds 4 h, Smicro and Vmicro extremely slow increase and even reach a saturation value, whereas Smeso and Vmeso gradually
enhance, which brings the increase of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and total pore volume. Figure S2 shows the comparison of pore structures of MCBs-9-5 and
MCBs-9-5-r. In the absence of air, the MCBs-9-5-r sample has a BET
surface area of 492.8 m2 g–1 mainly contributed
by the micropore surface area of 439.5 m2 g–1 and these pores should be entirely originated from the pyrolysis
of the CS precursor. From the comparison of the pore size distribution
(Figure S2b), the MCBs-9-5-r sample owns
an indistinct pore size distribution, indicative of the existence
of small amount of pores, which is much poorer than the perfect multiscale
micropore size distribution of the MCBs-9-5 sample. Such result further
testifies the vital effect of air assisted on the generation of superior
microporosity. Thus, these results suggest the formation of a multiscale
microporous structure in the following stages: (i) the high-temperature
pyrolysis of the carbonaceous precursor generated abundant micropores;
(ii) with the assistant of air, these micropores further developed;
(iii) some ultramicropores were enlarged and even produced mesopores
by the combination of the partial carbon skeleton. Figure 2 depicts the micropore size
distribution of all as-obtained MCB materials measured by CO2 adsorption at 0 °C using the density functional theory (DFT)
method. Obviously, a multiscale micropore can be found in all samples,
especially a superior hierarchical narrow micropore size (<0.7
nm) distribution. With the increase of calcination temperature, micropore
sizes are gradually developed and enlarged and MCBs-9-3 exhibits a
best micropore size in all MCBs-x-3 samples, especially
the outstanding narrow micropore size distribution. Similarly, the
micropore size shows a similar evolution with the prolonging of calcination
time, and micropore sizes are gradually widened from narrow micropores
(<0.7 nm) to fine micropores (0.7–1.0 nm) and even large
micropores (>1.0 nm), which should be related to the further pyrolysis
of the glucose-based precursor, resulting in the release of more volatile
substance.

Figure 2 Micropore (<1 nm) size distribution of all as-obtained MCB materials
measured by CO2 adsorption at 0 °C using the DFT method:
(a) MCBs-x-3 and (b) MCBs-9-y.

Figure S3a,b presents the wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all MCB materials with different
calcination temperatures and times. All of the samples exhibited two
similar broad and weak diffraction peaks at about 2θ = 21.8
and 43.5 °, which correspond to (002) and (100) diffractions
of the amorphous carbon skeleton, respectively, suggesting the low
crystallinity of the resultant MCB materials.30 In addition, the intensity of diffraction peaks in XRD patterns
gradually weakened from MCBs-9-1 to MCBs-9-6, which could be related
to the gradual decrease in the microcrystallite zones of graphite
in the MCB samples as the increase of reaction time.31 The Raman spectra of all MCBs-x-3 materials
are displayed in Figure S4. Clearly, two
strong peaks can be seen in these materials, which center at ∼1334
and 1587 cm–1. The peak located at about 1334 cm–1 is assigned to the D-band, which should be ascribed
to the vibration of carbon atoms with dangling bonds in planar terminations
of the disordered graphite-like framework.32 The other peak centered at about 1587 cm–1 is
referred to the G-band, corresponding to the ideal graphite in-plane
vibrations with E2g symmetry.33 Besides, the degree of graphitization can be further characterized
by the ratio of relative intensities of D- and G-band peaks (ID/IG). The values
of ID/IG for
MCBs-7-3, MCBs-8-3, MCBs-9-3, and MCBs-10-3 are 1.08, 0.99, 0.98,
and 0.96, respectively, which indicate that the degree of graphitization
enhances with the rise of carbonization temperature.

To evaluate
the variation of surface functional groups, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the resultant samples are presented
in Figure S5. In the CS precursor, the
bands at 1710 and 1620 cm–1 should be attributed
to C=O and C=C stretching vibrations, respectively,
and the results support the concept of aromatization of glucose during
hydrothermal treatment.34 The bands centered
at 1000–1300 cm–1 are related to the C–OH
stretching vibration and −OH bending vibration, which imply
the existence of large numbers of residual hydroxy groups.35 The other adsorption bands at 1410–1510
and 2840–2930 cm–1 correspond to the C–H
bending vibration and stretching vibration, respectively.36 The broad adsorption band at 3450 cm–1 should be ascribed to −OH bending vibration in the H2O molecule. Such results suggest that the CS precursor should
possess abundant oxygen-containing and hydrogen-containing functional
groups. Obviously, a similar FTIR spectrum can be found in MCB samples,
in which only the C=C stretching vibration at ca. 1620 cm–1 can be clearly found in MCB samples, and the characteristic
adsorption bands of C=O and C–O disappear, which should
be ascribed to the pyrolysis of precursors at high temperature, resulting
in the elimination of surface oxygen-containing groups. In addition,
it is clear that the adsorption bands of C–H (at 2840–2930
cm–1) and −OH (at 3450 cm–1) become indistinct and even disappeared with the rise of activation
temperature, indicating that the activation temperature has a significant
impact on the surface chemical property of MCB materials.

To
reveal the evolution of the morphology and pore structure, the
as-obtained MCB samples were characterized by electron microscopy.
As displayed in Figure 3a, glucose-based CS precursors present a cross-linked bead structure
with an average diameter of ca. 400 nm. Obviously, such cross-linked
beads are well-maintained after carbonizing the CS precursor in air
atmosphere at different temperatures for 3 h (Figure 3), suggesting that the pyrolysis and air-assisted
activation process do not destroy the initial structure of the CS
precursor. However, the diameter size of cross-linked carbon beads
reduces as a result of structural shrinkage, and MCBs-9-3 exhibits
an average diameter of ∼200 nm, and even MCBs-10-3 possesses
a smaller size of ∼150 nm because of a higher carbonization
temperature. Figure S6 shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of as-prepared MCBs carbonized at
900 °C with different activation times. Similarly, all MCBs-9-y samples also retain the cross-linked bead structure, and
importantly, these cross-linked carbon beads retain an almost identical
diameter of ∼200 nm, testifying that prolonging the activation
time has no influence on the morphological structure. The evolutions
of the morphology and structure are further verified by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images. As shown in Figure 4, MCBs-x-3 materials clearly
exhibit the progressive variation of the morphology and porous pore
structure with the change of the carbonization temperature. Consistent
with the SEM observation, all MCBs-x-3 materials
present the cross-linked bead structure. Furthermore, from the high-magnification
TEM images (Figure 4e–h), large numbers of nanopores are easily discernible on
the surface of carbon beads. Meanwhile, it could be easily observed
that these pores in MCBs-x-3 samples gradually enlarge
as the increasing activation temperature. Similar results can be found
from the TEM images of MCBs-9-y samples (Figure S7). Such results further confirm that
the carbonization temperature and reaction time play a crucial role
in the development of porosity of MCB materials.

2.2 CO2 Capture Performance
The CO2 adsorption
capacities of all as-obtained materials
are investigated at two representative temperatures (0 and 25 °C),
and the adsorption isotherms are presented in Figure 5, and the related uptake capacities are listed
in Table 2. As shown
in Figure 5a, it can
be observed that the MCBs-7-3 sample has a CO2 adsorption
capacity of 3.79 mmol g–1 at 0 °C and 1 bar.
With the increasing activation temperature, the obtained MCBs-8-3
and MCBs-9-3 samples exhibit the enhanced CO2 capture capacities
of 4.74 and 5.64 mmol g–1, respectively; however,
the further increase in the annealing temperature brings a negative
effect on the CO2 adsorption capacity, and a declined CO2 uptake value of 5.39 mmol g–1 is obtained
over the MCBs-10-3 sample. Figure 5b displays the CO2 adsorption isotherms
of MCBs-9-y series materials; it can be seen that
CO2 uptakes are in the range of 4.85–6.15 mmol g–1, and the CO2 adsorption capacities of
MCBs-9-y materials are improved and then declined
with the progressive prolonging of reaction time. Similarly, the same
variation tendency of CO2 adsorption capacity over MCBs-x-3 and MCBs-9-y series materials tested
at 25 °C can also be observed in Figure 5c,d, respectively. For all the as-prepared
materials, the CO2 uptake enhances with the increase of
CO2 pressure. Noticeably, at relatively low pressure, the
CO2 uptakes of both MCBs-x-3 and MCBs-9-y series materials, especially MCBs-10-3 and MCBs-9-6 samples,
are a little lower at higher activation temperature and longer reaction
time, which should be related to the size effect37 because the micropore size of the obtained MCB materials
further developed and enlarged gradually as the temperature and time
increased, resulting in the decrease of the proportion of micropores
(<1 nm).

The micropore surface
area and micropore pore volume, especially
micropores of size <1 nm, play a significant role in CO2 adsorption, and the relevant analysis results are displayed in Figure 6 and Figure S8, respectively. Apparently, even though
MCBs-9-6 and MCBs-10-3 possess higher total surface area and larger
total pore volume compared with those of MCBs-9-3, MCBs-9-4, and MCBs-9-5
materials, their CO2 uptakes are much lower than those
of MCBs-9-3, MCBs-9-4, and MCBs-9-5, which should be attributed to
their lower micropore (<1 nm) surface areas and micropore pore
volumes. As displayed in Figures 6 and S7, the CO2 uptake (at 0 and 25 °C, 1 bar) is not determined by the total
surface area and pore volume, but by the pore size, especially narrow
micropores of <1 nm, which are more efficient than larger micropores
and mesopores, creating stronger interactions between CO2 molecules and carbon adsorbents. Such results are consistent with
the previous reported works.38−40

Figure 6 Dependence of CO2 capture capacity
(at 25 °C and
1 bar) on surface area/micropore (<1 nm) surface area (a) and pore
volume/micropore (<1 nm) volume (b) for as-prepared MCBs-9-y materials.

On the basis of the above results, it can be clearly found
that
MCB materials display a good property for CO2 capture,
exhibiting an excellent potential as CO2 adsorbents. The
optimal sample of MCBs-9-5 shows the highest CO2 capture
values of 6.15 mmol g–1 (at 0 °C, 1 bar) and
4.25 mmol g–1 (at 25 °C, 1 bar), which should
mainly be related to the presence of large numbers of narrow micropores
(<1 nm). To examine the influence of air activation, the MCBs-9-5
and MCBs-9-5-r samples were compared with regard to their CO2 adsorption capacities (Figure S9). Obviously,
the CO2 uptakes of MCBs-9-5-r are only 3.72 mmol g–1 (at 0 °C, 1 bar) and 2.79 mmol g–1 (at 25 °C, 1 bar), which are much lower than those of the MCBs-9-5
sample. Table 3 lists
the CO2 adsorption capacities of a variety of reported
carbon-based adsorbents. Apparently, the CO2 adsorption
capacity of the MCBs-9-5 material is comparable and even higher than
other similar carbons and even some of the reported nitrogen-doped
porous carbons and hierarchical porous carbons derived by chemical
activation. For example, Wang et al. prepared a nitrogen-doped porous
carbon hollow sphere with an ultrahigh nitrogen content of 15.9 wt
%, which showed a CO2 uptake of 4.42 mmol g–1 at 0 °C and 1 bar.13 Cai et al.
reported poly(vinylidene chloride)-based carbon with ultrahigh microporosity
prepared by KOH activation, which exhibited a lower CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.64 mmol g–1 at 25 °C
and 1 bar.41 Therefore, from these comparisons,
it is clear that the resultant MCBs-9-5 material via this green, cost-efficient,
and free-chemical activating agent strategy achieves a satisfactory
CO2 capture capacity, which should be attributed to high
surface area, optimal micro-/mesopore proportion, and developed microporosity,
especially large microporosity dominated by pores of 0.5–0.9
nm.

2.3 CO2/N2 Selectivity
From the viewpoint
of practical applications, superior adsorbents
should possess a high selectivity against other gases in addition
to high CO2 uptake. To estimate the CO2 separation
performance of the optimal sample of MCBs-9-5 and the reference sample
of MCBs-9-5-r, their CO2 and N2 isotherms at
0 and 25 °C are displayed in Figure 7a,b, respectively. Clearly, the adsorption
capacity of N2 is much lower than that of CO2 at the same condition for both MCBs-9-5 and MCBs-9-5-r samples.
At 25 °C and 1 bar, the MCBs-9-5 sample has a CO2 uptake
of 4.25 mmol g–1 and a N2 adsorption
capacity of 0.24 mmol g–1, which translates to an
equilibrium CO2/N2 adsorption ratio of 18, and
this adsorption ratio is far higher than the CO2/N2 adsorption ratio of 8 for the MCBs-9-5-r sample, suggesting
the better selectivity of MCBs-9-5 for CO2 from N2 than that of MCBs-9-5-r. More importantly, the CO2/N2 adsorption ratio of 18 for MCBs-9-5 is much higher than that
of conventional porous carbons (typical 5–11) and even comparable
to those of nitrogen-doped carbons and microporous organic polymer-derived
carbons.42−45

(a) and MCBs-9-5-r (b) at 0 and 25 °C; IAST selectivity of CO2/N2 on MCBs-9-5 (c) and MCBs-9-5-r (d) at 0 and
25 °C.

We also employ the ideal
adsorbed solution theory (IAST) model
to further evaluate the selectivity for CO2 adsorption
from the simulated postcombustion flue gas, which is an often used
method to estimate the selectivity of solid adsorbents for any two
gases in a binary gas mixture. The CO2/N2 ratio
is 15/85 in the calculation, which represents the typical composition
of the flue gas. The selectivity for CO2 adsorption from
the IAST model was derived from the following equation  where S is the selectivity
for CO2, p is the uptake of adsorbed CO2/N2, q(CO2) is 0.15,
and q(N2) is 0.85. The calculation results
of IAST selectivity are presented in Figure 7c,d. MCBs-9-5 exhibits the CO2 adsorption selectivity of 49 and 61 at 0 and 25 °C under 1
bar, respectively, which are higher than the CO2 adsorption
selectivity of 29 and 41 for MCBs-9-5-r. Importantly, the CO2/N2 selectivity of MCBs-9-5 is remarkably high compared
with that of the other porous carbon-based sorbents and even comparable
with that of nitrogen-rich porous carbons,46−49 as shown in Table 3. The good selectivity in combination
with the satisfactory adsorption capacity makes the MCBs-9-5 material
highly promising in the selective capture of CO2 from gas
mixtures containing N2.

2.4 CO2 Isosteric Heat of Adsorption
(Qst) and Regeneration of the Adsorbent
To further reveal the interaction between the CO2 molecule/adsorbents
and evaluate the energetic heterogeneity of surfaces of adsorbents,
the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst)
was calculated from the CO2 adsorption isotherms measured
at 0 and 25 °C. As depicted in Figure 8, the Qst values
for all as-obtained MCBs at low surface coverage are ranged from 23
to 38 kJ mol–1. Obviously, the heat of adsorption
gradually declines at the low CO2 uptake and then reaches
a near plateau with the increasing CO2 uptake, manifesting
the heterogeneity of interaction between CO2 molecules
and the surface of adsorbents, which could be ascribed to the continuous
occupation of adsorption active sites with the growing CO2 uptake. Moreover, it is worth of notice that the Qst values of MCBs-x-3 samples gradually
decline with the increase of activation temperature, indicating the
weaker and weaker interactions between adsorbent surfaces and CO2 molecule as the elevated activation temperature.50 Such result should be related to the poorer
and poorer microporosity, especially the decreased narrow microporosity
(<1 nm) with the rise of activation temperature, resulting in the
weaker interaction. Similarly, the Qst values of MCBs-9-y present a roughly similar variation
trend, and the Qst values gradually decrease
with the prolonging of activation time, which could also be attributed
to the variation of micropores’ proportion and size. For the
MCBs-9-5-r sample, even though it has a higher Qst value than those of other MCBs-9-y materials,
its Qst value continuously declines with
the enhanced CO2 uptake, suggesting the nonuniform and
unstable CO2 adsorption on the MCBs-9-5-r adsorbent surface,
resulting in the poor regeneration and reversibility, which seriously
restricts it to be an efficient CO2 adsorbent.

Figure 8 Isosteric heat
of CO2 adsorption on all as-obtained
MCBs-x-3 (a) and MCBs-9-y (b) materials
calculated from the adsorption isotherms at 0 and 25 °C.

Apart from the high CO2 uptake capacity, the remarkable
CO2 adsorbents should possess easy regeneration ability
for practical utilization. The regeneration test of the MCBs-9-5 material
was conducted for five consecutive cycles at 0 and 25 °C. As
shown in Figure S10, the CO2 uptake remains almost constant in five cycles, which testifies that
the obtained MCBs-9-5 material has satisfactory recyclability with
relatively low energy requirement for regeneration.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a simple and cost-efficient strategy
was successfully
developed for the green synthesis of cross-linked MCBs derived from
sustainable starch sugar. Inimitably, this approach avoids the use
of chemical activating agents and only involves a simple curing process
in an air atmosphere, which makes it convenient and rapid to achieve
the preparation of MCBs in a large-scale industrial production. By
tuning the carbonization temperature and reaction time, the microporosity,
especially ultramicroporosity, of the resultant materials could be
easily tailored to arise primarily from pores of size 0.4–0.9
nm, which greatly favors the postcombustion CO2 adsorption.
The optimal sample of MCBs-9-5 carbonized at 900 °C for 5 h under
air atmosphere exhibits a satisfactory CO2 uptake of 4.25
mmol g–1 at room temperature under 1 bar, which
should be related to its high proportion of micropores of <1 nm,
high narrow micropore surface area, and large micropore volume. More
importantly, the MCBs-9-5 material also possesses a superior recyclability
for CO2 capture and a high CO2 adsorption selectivity
against N2 for CO2/N2 separation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of MCBs
The carbon bead
precursor was synthesized by a convenient and controllable hydrothermal
synthetic route using glucose as a carbon source.23 Typically, 6 g of glucose was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized
water to obtain a clear solution, and then the solution was transferred
into a Teflon-sealed autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 8
h. The puce products were obtained by filtration, washed repeatedly
by deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for more than 8 h. The
obtained glucose-based carbon bead precursors were defined as the
CS precursor.

A 1 g mass of dried CS precursors was placed in
a 10 mL corundum crucible with a cover and then directly transferred
into a muffle furnace at high temperatures (700, 800, 900, and 1000
°C) using crucible tongs. The samples were calcined for regular
times (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h) and then were taken out to cool to
room temperature for obtaining cross-linked MCBs. The resultant samples
were denoted as MCBs-x-y, where x = 7, 8, 9, and 10, referring to the calcination temperature
of 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C, respectively; y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, representing calcination time of 1–6
h, respectively. In the synthesis process, the air, especially O2 in the air, can be used in the calcination process of material
preparation.

For comparison, the CS precursor was directly carbonized
at 900
°C for 5 h under a N2 atmosphere, which was designated
as MCBs-9-5-r.

4.2 Characterizations
XRD patterns were
monitored by a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm) as an X-ray source. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were carried out at −196 °C using a micromeritics
ASAP 2020 HD88 analyzer. Before adsorption, the samples were out-gassed
at 200 °C for 10 h. The specific surface area (SBET) was evaluated using the BET method, and the hierarchical
pore size distributions were calculated according to the DFT method.
The micropore was analyzed using the t-plot method,
and the ratio of micro-/mesopore was calculated according to the t-plot method. The micropore size distributions were also
analyzed by fitting the CO2 adsorption isotherm at 0 °C
using the DFT model. The morphology was observed from a FEI Tecnai
G2 20 TEM with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a SEM (Quanta
250 FEG). FTIR spectroscopy spectra of a sample in KBr wafer were
recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 370 spectrometer.

4.3 Gas Adsorption
Tests
Gas adsorption
isotherms of CO2 and N2 were measured using
a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 instrument. Highly pure gases CO2 (99.999%) and N2 (99.999%) were employed for the
measures. The isotherms of CO2 and N2 at 0 and
25 °C were conducted in an ice-water bath and a water bath, respectively.
Prior to each gas uptake measurement, the samples were degassed at
200 °C for 10 h to remove the guest molecules from pores. For
the regeneration experiment, the recovered adsorbents were evacuated
at room temperature for 10 min and then reused for next adsorption.
