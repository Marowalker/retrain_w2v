As
a widely used separation device, a cyclone separator is especially
important to improve its separation efficiency. In this paper, a new
two-stage cyclone separator is designed and modeled by the Reynolds
stress model. Under the premise of determining the diameter of the
second-stage cyclone (D), the effects of five first-stage cyclone
diameters (Du) on the performance of the two-stage cyclone are simulated.
The performance of the single-stage cyclone separator is also obtained.
The results show that Du has significant effects on the internal pressure
field, flow field, and vortex core of the two-stage cyclone. Compared
with the single-stage cyclone separator, the separation efficiency
of the two-stage cyclone separator is significantly improved. When
Du = 6D, the separation efficiency is improved by 15.5% compared with
that of the single-stage cyclone. In addition, the two-stage cyclone
separator can effectively reduce the Euler number.

1 Introduction
Since the advent of the
first conical cyclone in the 1880s, scientists
have conducted various studies on the flow field characteristics,
structural form, and size ratio of cyclones to improve their performance.1−6

The airflow and particle motion in the cyclone are very complicated.
To clarify the law of airflow and particle migration, scientists have
used a variety of research methods, including four types:7 (1) Experimental analysis methods: Solero and
Coghe8 used LDA to conduct an experimental
study on the entire gas flow field in the cyclone separator and measured
the movement of the gas flow from the inlet to the exhaust pipe in
detail, to better understand the complex flow field of the cyclone
separator and realize the CFD value. The verification of the simulation
provides complete data. Yazdabadi et al., Zhang and Hui, and Balestin
et al.9−11 used PIV technology to study the variation of the
precessing vortex core (PVC) of the cyclone separator. It was found
that the flow rate and the number of swirls all affected the size,
shape, and position of the PVC and the eddy current due to the inclination
and bending of the PVC to the wall of the cyclone separator. The component
of the vector is perpendicular to the longitudinal section of the
cyclone. (2) Theoretical experience formula method: Karagoz and Avci12 proposed a mathematical model that can predict
the pressure drop of a tangential inlet cyclone. Chen and Shi13 proposed a general model for calculating the
pressure drop of a cyclone separator. However, due to the different
types of cyclone separators, various assumptions exist, resulting
in large differences in the results of various empirical formulas.
Although the theoretical experience formula is simple and convenient,
the accuracy is insufficient. (3) Statistical analysis methods: The
models proposed by Casal and Martinez-Benet14 and Dirgo15 were developed by multiple
regression analysis of larger pressure drop data sets based on different
cyclone configurations. Although the statistical model is more convenient
for predicting cyclone pressure drop, it is much more difficult to
determine the most appropriate correlation function for fitting experimental
data in this method, especially the limited computer statistical software
and robust algorithms available at the time. (4) CFD numerical simulation
method: Juengcharoensukying et al.16 studied
the influence of the cyclone and inlet angle on separation performance.
Su et al.17 studied the influence of the
exhaust mode on the turbulence characteristics of the separator. Zhang
et al.18 designed a new hexagonal cyclone
separator and optimized it. Some scientists11,19−21 used algorithms to optimize the parameters of the
cyclone separator to get the best parameters of the separator, and
some scientists22,23 used electric and magnetic fields
to improve the separation efficiency of the cyclone separator. Although
each research method of the cyclone can realize the design and optimization
of the cyclone separator, the advantages of the CFD numerical simulation
method are more obvious, not only the parameters can be changed quickly
but also the pressure field, the flow field, and the vortex core can
be expressed relatively intuitively.

However, with the need
for more and more fine particles, the single-stage
cyclone has been unable to meet the requirements, and the two-stage
cyclone and even multistage cyclone have emerged.24−28 In this paper, the effect of the external cyclone
diameter (Du) on the performance of a new two-stage cyclone separator
is studied. This paper uses the combination of experimental analysis
and CFD numerical simulation to study the effect of Du on the performance
of a two-stage cyclone separator. The first-stage cyclone separator
has high separation efficiency for large particles and can effectively
reduce the load of the second-stage cyclone separator; the second-stage
cyclone has high separation efficiency for small particles and can
effectively separate small particles to make up for the deficiency
of the first-stage cyclone. If Du is too small, the inside of the
first-stage cyclone is too narrow to form an unobstructed airflow
path that moves from the first-stage cyclone floor to the second-stage
cyclone inlet; if Du is too large, the two-stage cyclone will be too
bulky.

Therefore, in the case of a fixed second-stage cyclone
diameter,
it is necessary to study the effect of Du on the performance of the
two-stage cyclone separator. By analyzing the internal pressure field,
flow field, vortex core, Euler number, Stokes number, etc. of the
two-stage cyclone separator, the effect of Du on the performance of
the two-stage cyclone separator is obtained.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Simulation Result Verification
and Discussion
Pressure drop and separation efficiency are
the two most important
indicators of the cyclone. Figure 1 is a comparison of experimental and simulation values.
The solid line indicates the simulation value, and the broken line
indicates the experimental value. When Du = 1D, it means a single-stage
cyclone separator. It is found that the pressure drop experimental
results are similar to the simulation results, and the error is within
2.5%. The simulation value of the separation efficiency is basically
consistent with the variation of the experimental value, and the error
is within 5.6%. Since the first-stage cyclone inlet, the second-stage
cyclone inlet, and the second-stage cyclone outlet area are different,
the pressure drop is represented by the difference in total pressure.
The following formula is used to calculate separation efficiency 1  where η is the efficiency, C1 is
the inlet particle concentration, and C2 is the export particle concentration.

Figure 1 Comparison of experimental
values and simulated values: (a) Pressure
drop and (b) efficiency.

It can be seen from Figure 1a that the first-stage
cyclone pressure drop is much smaller
than the second-stage cyclone. The pressure drop caused by the second-stage
cyclone is dominant, and the pressure drop caused by the first-stage
cyclone is secondary. Compared to a single-stage cyclone, the pressure
drop of the two-stage cyclone is greatly increased. As Du increases,
the first-stage cyclone pressure drop gradually increases, but when
Du = 6D, the first-stage cyclone pressure drop is reduced, which is
an interesting thing. As Du increases, the second-stage cyclone and
the two-stage cyclone pressure drop gradually decrease, and a local
maximum in pressure drop is observed at Du = 4D, which is also an
interesting observation.

It can be seen from Figure 1b that the total separation
efficiency of the two-stage cyclone
separator is larger than that of the single-stage cyclone. As Du increases,
the total efficiency of the two-stage cyclone gradually increases.
When Du = 6D, the separation efficiency of the two-stage cyclone is
15.5% higher than that of the single-stage cyclone. When Du increased
from 2D to 6D, the first-stage cyclone separation efficiency increased
from 34.9 to 96.1%, an increase of 91.2%. When Du is greater than
4D, the total efficiency is greater than 99%, and as Du increases,
the total efficiency does not increase significantly. Therefore, if
a two-stage cyclone is designed, to ensure a high total separation
efficiency, the external cyclone diameter should be at least four
times the internal cyclone diameter.

The test points for testing
the internal flow field and concentration
field of the cyclone are the same, and the arrangement of the measuring
points and the test results is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Measurement point arrangement of internal flow
field and concentration
field experiment verification: (a) measuring point arrangement, (b)
volume concentration distribution, (c) first-stage cyclone spiral,
(d) comparison of simulated and experimental particle concentrations,
and (e) comparison of simulated and experimental velocity.

Figure 2a
shows
the arrangement of the internal flow field and the concentration field
measurement point, which is the z = 0 section. The
first-stage cyclone is arranged with 10 measuring points with a measuring
point spacing of 24 mm. The second-stage cyclone is arranged with
five measuring points with a measuring point spacing of 16 mm. Figure 2b shows a plot of
the concentration distribution of the simulated body particles in
the two-stage cyclone separator. It can be seen that there is a clear
spiral on the inner wall of the first-stage cyclone, which is consistent
with the experimental results observed in Figure 2c. It is also consistent with the results
of other scholars.27

It can be seen
from Figure 2d,e that
the simulation results are in good agreement with
the experimental results, indicating that the simulation results are
reliable. Due to the complexity of the flow field inside the cyclone,
errors are considered acceptable.

2.2 Effect
of External Cyclone Diameter on Pressure
Field and Flow Field
The pressure field and flow field can
reveal the reasons for the variation of the two-stage cyclone pressure
drop and separation efficiency. Numerical simulation can describe
the internal pressure field and flow field of the cyclone in detail,
which is unmatched by experiments. To quantitatively reveal the internal
pressure field and flow field distribution of the two-stage cyclone
separator, eight straight lines (y = −0.040
m, y = −0.064 m, y = −0.096
m, y = −0.128 m, y = −0.160
m, y = −0.192 m, y = −0.256
m, and y = −0.288 m) in the z = 0 section are selected as the research objects, and the static
pressure, tangential velocity, and axial velocity along the x axis distribution are studied. Although y = −0.040 m, y = −0.064 m, and y = −0.096 m three lines are in the cylinder part
of the second-stage cyclone separator, which is called the cylinder
straight line, y = −0.128 m, y = −0.160 m, and y = −0.192 m three
lines are in the vertebral body part of the second-stage cyclone separator,
which is called the vertebral body straight line; the two lines of y = −0.256 m and y = −0.288
m are in the hopper part of the second-stage cyclone separator, which
is called the hopper straight line, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Analysis lines at z = 0 section.

2.2.1 Effect of External Cyclone Diameter on Static
Pressure
Due to the presence of the swirling airflow, the
internal pressure drop problem of the cyclone becomes very complicated. Figure 4 shows the internal
static pressure distribution of the two-stage cyclone separator at
different Du’s. When Du ≥ 2D, with the increase of Du,
the internal static pressure of the first-stage cyclone gradually
increases from the inner wall of the first-stage cyclone to the outer
wall of the second-stage cyclone. When Du = 2D, the falling gradient
is the largest; when 3D ≤ Du ≤ 5 D, the difference of
the descending gradient is small; when Du = 6D, the falling gradient
is the smallest. Conversely, the internal static pressure drop gradient
of the second-stage cyclone is not so regular. The order of the static
pressure values at the x = 0 position is 2D <
4D < 3D < 5D < 6D. This law of variation is consistent with
the simulation and experimental values of pressure drop. Static pressure
is the main cause of pressure drop changes, and this can explain why
4D is an interesting observation. During the change of the external
diameter from 3D–5D, the internal pressure field changes to
some extent, resulting in a high pressure drop at 4D.

Figure 4 Static pressure distribution:
(a) Y = −0.040
m, (b) Y = -0.064 m, (c) Y = −0.096
m, (d) Y = −0.128 m, (e) Y = −0.160 m, (f) Y = −0.192 m, (g) Y = −0.256 m, and (h) Y = −0.288
m.

Regardless of the value of Du,
the internal static pressure of
the second-stage cyclone exhibits a ″V″-shaped distribution
along the x axis and a minimum at x = 0. This phenomenon is consistent with the principle of conservation
of momentum.29 The principle of conservation
of the momentum moment is also called the principle of conservation
of angular momentum, which is a process of static pressure conversion
to dynamic pressure. Because the first-stage cyclone has only the
cylinder, there is no vertebral body and hopper, and the inlet velocity
is also less than the second-stage cyclone; the second-stage cyclone
pressure drop is much larger than the first-stage cyclone pressure
drop.30 As shown in Figure 4c, when y = −0.096
m and Du = 2D, the static pressure value at x = 0
is −6972 Pa, which is 2.3 times that of Du = 1D (−3033
Pa) and 1.3 times that of Du = 6D (−5373 Pa). The first-stage
cyclone static pressure is much smaller than the second-stage cyclone
static pressure. This is consistent with the previous experimental
and simulation values.

2.2.2 Effect of External Cyclone
Diameter on Tangential
Velocity
The tangential velocity is an important factor affecting
the centrifugal force of the particles.31Figure 5 shows the
internal tangential velocity distribution of the two-stage cyclone
separator at different Du’s. It can be seen that the velocity
follows a symmetric distribution. In the cylinder portion, the tangential
velocity at the first-stage cyclone wall is zero and increases to
a maximum at 0.45D from the wall along the radial direction. It is
then reduced again to zero at the second-stage cyclone wall and increases
to a maximum along the radial direction at 0.14D from the wall. Due
to the friction between the eddy current detector and the vortex core,
the tangential velocity of the second-stage cyclone maximum to the
center point is gradually reduced.29 The
tangential velocity is well symmetric in the barrel portion and the
vertebral portion. However, in the hopper part, since the vortex core
is offset and is not at the same position as the geometric center,
the tangential velocity symmetry is poor.29

Figure 5 Tangential
velocity: (a) Y = −0.040 m,
(b) Y = −0.064 m, (c) Y =
−0.096 m, (d) Y = −0.128 m, (e) Y = −0.160 m, (f) Y = −0.192
m, (g) Y = −0.256 m, and (h) Y = −0.288 m.

In the cylinder part
and the hopper part, the change of Du has
a great effect on the maximum value of the first-stage cyclone tangential
velocity and has a little effect on the maximum value of the second-stage
cyclone tangential velocity. As shown in Figure 5a, when y = −0.040
m and Du = 2D, the maximum tangential velocity of the first-stage
cyclone is 44.8 m/s, which is 33% higher than the maximum value (30.0
m/s) of Du = 6D. At this time, the change of the maximum value of
the first-stage cyclone tangential velocity is not obvious. The results
of the vertebral body are just the opposite. The change of Du has
a great effect on the maximum tangential velocity of the second-stage
cyclone but has a little effect on the maximum tangential velocity
of the first-stage cyclone. As shown in Figure 5e, when y = −0.040
m and Du = 2D, the maximum tangential velocity of the second-stage
cyclone is 38.5 m/s, which is 30% larger than the maximum value of
Du = 6D (27.1 m/s). At this time, the change of the maximum value
of the first-stage cyclone tangential velocity is relatively insignificant.

As Du increases, the maximum velocity of the first-stage cyclone
gradually decreases. Theoretically, as the first-stage cyclone increases
with Du, the separation efficiency gradually decreases. However, according
to the simulation and experimental values, as the Du increases, the
first-stage cyclone separation efficiency gradually increases. The
reason for this may be that as the Du increases, the axial velocity
decreases gradually at the bottom of the first-stage cyclone. The
possibility of particle deposition at the bottom of the first-stage
cyclone gradually increases, resulting in a gradual increase in the
efficiency of the first-stage cyclone separation.

2.2.3 Effect of External Cyclone Diameter on Axial
Velocity
The axial velocity is an important factor in the
residence time of the particles in the cyclone. Figure 6 shows the internal axial velocity distribution
of the two-stage cyclone separator at different Du’s. It can
be seen that since the first-stage cyclone has only one inlet in the
positive direction of the x axis, the internal axial
velocity of the first-stage cyclone is not completely symmetric with
respect to x = 0, and the first-stage cyclone is
partially negative x axis. The axial velocity of
the direction is significantly larger than the positive direction
of the x axis. This velocity structure promotes the
deposition of particles on the substrate. With the increase of Du,
the axial velocity change of the first-stage cyclone gradually becomes
slower, which is beneficial to reduce the phenomenon of particle entrainment.
Since the second-stage cyclone has two inlets, the axial velocity
is completely symmetrical in the axial direction of the second-stage
cyclone, presenting a perfect ″W″ shape.

Figure 6 Axial velocity: (a) Y = −0.040 m, (b) Y = −0.064
m, (c) Y = −0.096
m, (d) Y = −0.128 m, (e) Y = −0.160 m, (f) Y = −0.192 m, (g) Y = −0.256 m, and (h) Y = −0.288
m.

In the vertebral body part, when
Du = 2D and 4D, the axial velocity
of the second-stage cyclone at x = 0 is large, indicating
that the suction force at this time is large, which is favorable for
the gas discharge after purification.29

In the hopper part, when Du = 1D, the axial velocity at x = 0 is the largest, which will cause the particles deposited
in the hopper to be re-entrained, reducing the separation efficiency.
This is also an important reason why the separation efficiency of
the two-stage cyclone separator is greater than that of the single-stage
cyclone separator. As Du increases, the axial velocity at the bottom
of the first-stage cyclone is sorted from large to small at x = 0 to 2D > 3D > 4D > 5D > 6D. This is in
complete agreement
with the guess mentioned above. The bottom axial velocity is an important
factor affecting the cyclone separation efficiency.

2.3 Effect of External Cyclone Diameter on Vortex
Core
There are many ways to identify vortex core, and the
most basic of which is based on the identification of velocity gradient
tensors. The criteria for identifying the vortex core based on the
velocity gradient tensor are Q-criterion, Δ-criterion, λ2-criterion,
swirling strength criterion, enhanced swirling strength criterion,
and triple decomposition.32 Of these several
criteria, Q-criterion is the most widely used.33 The Q-criterion is the second invariant of the velocity
gradient tensor, which defines a vortex as a ″connected fluid
region with a positive second invariant of ∇u″.34 For a region with positive values, it could
include regions with negative discriminants and exclude regions with
positive discriminants.

Figures 7 and 8 show the vortex core
region based on the Q-criterion (level set to 0.04, 0.08, and colored
with velocity magnitude) for the first-stage cyclone and second-stage
cyclone, respectively. As can be seen from Figure 7, as the change of Du, the first-stage cyclone
vortex core changes significantly. When Du = 2D, the vortex core completely
surrounds the second-stage cyclone, and the vortex core region is
a circle around the central axis. When Du = 3D, the vortex core around
the outer wall of the second-stage cyclone is distorted, and the ″S″
shape is formed in the vertebral body part and the hopper part, which
is not conducive to the separation of the particles. When Du = 4D,
the lower vortex core of the first-stage cyclone separator appears
to be tail swinging, but it is obviously larger than the normal pendulum
tail. With the increase of Du, the volume of the first-stage cyclone
increases, and the tangential velocity of the vortex core region decreases
significantly, causing the vortex core region around the inner wall
of the primary cyclone separator and the outer wall of the second-stage
cyclone to gradually decrease. There is obvious deformation or even
fracture on the surface of the vortex core, which will cause energy
attenuation.35

Figure 7 Vortex core representation
based on Q-criterion at a level of 0.04
in first-stage cyclone: (a) Du = 2D, (b) Du = 3D, (c) Du = 4D, (d)
Du = 5D, and (e) Du = 6D.

Figure 8 Vortex
core representation based on Q-criterion at a level of 0.08
in second-stage cyclone: (a) Du = 1D, (b) Du = 2D, (c) Du = 3D, (d)
Du = 4D, (e) Du = 5D, and (f) Du = 6D.

It can be seen from Figure 8 that since the gas flow rate is constant, when Du ≥
2D, the gas flow rate entering the second-stage cyclone does not substantially
change, and only the pressure affects the vortex core, so the change
of the second-stage cyclone vortex core is not obvious.

2.4 Effect of External Cyclone Diameter on Particle
Separation Efficiency
The separation efficiency is an important
parameter to describe the performance of the cyclone separator.27 In addition to the overall separation efficiency,
the performance of the cyclone can also be expressed by the cut size
and maximum size of the particles. There are two ways to express the
cut size and the maximum size: one is expressed in micrometer, and
the other is expressed in the Stokes number. The Stokes number based
on the cut size and the maximum size can be expressed as36 2   3  where dmean is the particle cut size, dmax is the particle maximum size, ρp is
the particle
density, Vin is the inlet velocity, μ
is the gas viscosity, and Din is the inlet
equivalent diameter.

As can be seen from Figure 9, the variation law of the cyclone Stokes
number with Du is consistent with the variation law of the cyclone
efficiency. The Stokes number is the characteristic response time
of the fluid divided by the characteristic response time of the particle.
If the Stokes number is small that is much less than 1, it means that
the particle motion is tightly coupled to the fluid motion that is
the particle dispersal is the same as the fluid dispersal. If the
Stokes number is large, the particles are not influence by the fluid—their
response time is longer than the time that the fluid has to act on
it, and so the particle will pass through the flow without much deflection
in its initial trajectory. Therefore, the Stokes number as a dimensionless
parameter can reflect the cyclone separation efficiency to some extent.
The larger the Stokes number, the higher the separation efficiency.
As can be seen from Figure 9a, as Du increases, the Stokes number gradually increases,
and the separation efficiency also increases.

Figure 9 Stokes number: (a) first-stage
cyclone Stokes number and (b) second-stage
cyclone Stokes number.

2.5 Effect
of External Cyclone Diameter on Pressure
Drop
Another important parameter describing the performance
of a cyclone is the pressure drop, which can be expressed in terms
of the dimensionless parameter Euler number (Eu).36,37 The Euler number expression is 4  

As can be seen from Figure 10, the variation
law of the cyclone Euler number with Du is consistent with the variation
law of the cyclone pressure drop. When Du = 6D, the two-stage cyclone
Euler number is reduced by 51.2% compared to the single-stage cyclone.
When the fluid velocity is constant, the Euler number is consistent
with the pressure drop because the Euler number is a dimensionless
parameter that characterizes the relationship between fluid pressure
drop and fluid kinetic energy.

Figure 10 Euler number.

3 Conclusions
This paper presents a new two-stage
cyclone separator. Based on
the experimental research, the effect of external cyclone diameter
Du on the performance of the two-stage cyclone separator is studied
by CFD simulation. The main conclusions are as follows:(1) The external cyclone
diameter Du has
a significant effect on the pressure field, flow field, and vortex
core of the two-stage cyclone, and the effect on the first-stage cyclone
is significantly more significant than that of the second-stage cyclone.

(2) The two-stage cyclone
separator has
higher separation efficiency than the single-stage cyclone separator.
Also, with the increase of Du, the separation efficiency of the two-stage
cyclone gradually increases. When Du ≥ 4D, the separation efficiency
of the two-stage cyclone is greater than 99%.

(3) The variation law of the cyclone Stokes
number with Du is consistent with the variation law of the cyclone
efficiency. Also, the variation law of the cyclone Euler number with
Du is consistent with the variation law of the cyclone pressure drop.
Compared with the single-stage cyclone, the Euler number of the two-stage
cyclone can be reduced by 51.2%.



4 Experimental Section and Computational Methods
4.1 Experimental
Schematic
The experimental
schematic and geometric design of the two-stage cyclone separator
are shown in Figure 11. The test bench and method used are the same as described in the
previous work,27 and the particle counter
used is a portable particle counter (AeroTrakTM TSI 9306-V) for determining
the number of particles in the upstream and downstream. The experimental
results show that the particle size distribution and cumulative distribution
of talc powder are shown in Figure 12. The distribution index is 2.42, and the median is
1.73 μm. When Du = 1D, it means that there is only a second-stage
cyclone separator, and there is no first-stage cyclone separator.

To verify the accuracy of the simulation results from the internal
flow field and the particle concentration field, we use the DUSTTRAK
DRX Aerosol Monitor 8530 and the Kanomax Multichannel Anemomaster
System 6243 to measure the gas velocity and particle concentration,
respectively, as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 Gas velocity and particle concentration test system: (a)
DUSTTRAK
DRX Aerosol Monitor 8530 and (b) Kanomax Multichannel Anemomaster
System 6243.

The Kanomax Multichannel Anemomaster
System 6243 can form a multichannel
system while accurately and quickly measuring multipoint wind speed
values. The DUSTTRAK DRX Aerosol Monitor 8530 provides real-time aerosol
mass concentration readings by gravity sampling, but the instrument
has a disadvantage that the maximum range is only 400 mg/m3. Due to the high internal particle concentration of the first-stage
cyclone, when we measured the internal particle concentration of the
first-stage cyclone, it was found that the concentration on the y = −0.096 m measuring point exceeded the maximum
range of the DUSTTRAK DRX Aerosol Monitor 8530, resulting in the instrument
to malfunction, so we only measured the particle concentration field
in the second-stage cyclone. We selected Du = 4D to test the internal
flow field and concentration field of the cyclone using the Kanomax
Multichannel Anemomaster System 6243 and DUSTTRAK DRX Aerosol Monitor
8530.

4.2 Mathematical Model
Because the concentration
of talc at the inlet is small, the volume fraction is much less than
10%, and the effect of the particles on gas migration can be ignored.38 Assuming that the talc is a discrete phase,
and the gas is a continuous phase, the Euler–Lagrangian method
is used to simulate the two-phase flow.

For steady and incompressible
fluid flow in cyclone separators, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes
(RANS) equation is expressed as follows: 5  

The left hand side of this equation represents the change
in mean
momentum of the fluid element owing to the unsteadiness in the mean
flow and the convection by the mean flow. This change is balanced
by the mean body force, the isotropic stress owing to the mean pressure
field, the viscous stresses, and the apparent stress ( – ρui′uj′®)
owing to the fluctuating velocity field, generally referred to as
the Reynolds stress.

Because the Reynolds stress model (RSM)
considers the effects of
streamline curvature, eddy current, rotation, and the rapid change
of the strain rate in a more rigorous manner than single equation
and two-equation models, it can give accurate prediction results for
complex flows.6 In this paper, the RSM
is used as a closure model to solve the Reynolds stress tensor. The
mathematical model is shown below37 6   7   8   9   10  where i, j, and k are the three directions in the
Cartesian coordinate system; Dij, φij, Gij, εij, and S represent the diffusion
term, the pressure strain term, the production term, the dissipation
term, and the user-defined source term, respectively; ui, uj, and uk represent the velocity fluctuations.

After
the continuous phase is stabilized, the discrete phase is
injected from the inlet by the DPM method.39 ANSYS Fluent predicts the trajectory of a discrete phase particle
by integrating the force balance on the particle, which is written
in a Lagrangian reference frame. This force balance equates the particle
inertia with the forces acting on the particle and can be written
as: 11  where mp is the particle mass, μ is the fluid phase velocity,
μp is the particle velocity, ρ is the fluid
density, ρp is the density of the particle, F is an additional force,  is the
drag force, and τr is the particle relaxation time
calculated by 12  where μ is the molecular
viscosity of the fluid, dp is the particle
diameter, and Re is the relative Reynolds number.

A random tracking model is used to predict the particle migration
trajectory. The random tracking model does not depend on the shape
of the mesh and is very suitable for unstructured meshes by using
random methods including the effects of instantaneous turbulent velocity
fluctuations on particle trajectories.

4.4 Grid Independence Verification
The
geometric parameters of the designed two-stage cyclone separator do
not change except for the change of Du. As the external cyclone diameter
increases, the number of mesh elements gradually increases. To verify
grid independence, each Du needs to be verified. Also, simulations
and experimental comparisons have also been added. The verification
results are shown in the Table 2.

As can be seen from the Table 2, as the number of mesh elements increases,
the pressure
drop and separation efficiency change gradually. When mesh levels
1–4, the growth rate is higher. When mesh levels 4–5,
the growth rate is lower. Considering the computer performance, mesh
4 is selected as the final computing grid.
