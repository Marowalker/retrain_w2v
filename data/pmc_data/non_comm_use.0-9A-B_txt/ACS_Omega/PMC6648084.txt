A study of multiple
tissues was conducted to identify potential
metabolic differences in cattle differing in feed efficiency. Individual
feed intake and body weight was measured on 144 steers during 105
days on a high-concentrate ration. Steers were selected according
to differences in average daily gain (ADG) with those with the greatest
ADG (n = 8; 1.96 ± 0.02 kg/day) and least ADG
(n = 8; 1.57 ± 0.02 kg/day), whose dry matter
intake was within 0.32 SD of the mean intake (10.10 ± 0.05 kg/day).
Duodenum, liver, adipose, and longissimus-dorsi were collected at
slaughter, and metabolomics profiles were performed by ultra performance
liquid chromatography quadrupole-time of-flight mass spectrometry.
Principal components analyses, t-tests, and fold
changes in tissues profile were used to identify differential metabolites
between ADG groups. These were primarily involved in α-linolenic
metabolism, which was downregulated in the greatest ADG as compared
to least-ADG group in duodenum, adipose, and longissimus-dorsi. However,
taurine and glycerophospholipids metabolisms were both upregulated
in the greatest ADG compared with least-ADG group in the liver. The
phospholipids and cholesterol were quantified in the tissues. Lipid
transport and oxidation were the main common metabolic mechanisms
associated with cattle feed efficiency. Combining analyses of multiple
tissues may offer a powerful approach for defining the molecular basis
of differences in performance among cattle for key production attributes.

Introduction
Increased sustainability
of livestock production is needed by the
growing human population.1 Conversion of
feed into meat is associated, among others, with emission of greenhouse
gases and excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus.2 Thus, improving production efficiency by increasing beef
produced per amount of feed offered would reduce both operating cost
and waste from beef cattle production.

Through more than 50
years of research focused on nutritional management
and genetic selection for beef cattle production, feed efficiency
conversion rate has been improved on average from 10.2:13,4 to 5.4:1.5,6 Some of the traditional strategies are the
use of high-concentrate diets and animal selection by moderately heritable
variables such as intake and gain.7,8 However, large
phenotypic differences regarding many complex traits of general biological
interest in cattle such as growth, fat deposition, and energy partitioning
are not completely understood.9 Application
of new technologies, including “omics” selections that
incorporate molecular breeding values, plays an important role in
meeting these challenges.10 The use of
genome-wide SNP markers is a promising predictor of the genetic merit
of animals, despite genetics limiting to explain the differences of
the phenotype.10 Thus, the final “omic”
level in a biological system, metabolomics may provide the most “functional”
information of the omics technologies, allowing the measure of the
end products of the complex genetic epigenetic and environmental interactions.11 This analytical technique is increasingly used
in livestock research for providing a distinctive insight into the
biochemical activity and robustly correlate with animal production
traits.11

For the first time, we
previously characterized metabolite changes
in the rumen using the distinct ruminal profiling method, identifying
33 biomarkers related to differences in average daily gain (ADG).12 Linoleic/α-linolenic acids (ALA) metabolism
and biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids were the most altered functional
pathways in the rumen associated with production efficiency of beef
steers. In addition, fatty acids were quantified and evaluated as
potential biomarkers to predict ADG in cattle.

An identification
of a distinctive physiological process across
multiple tissues could therefore usefully contribute for understanding
the mechanism associated with cattle feed efficiency. We hypothesize
that differences in ADG of cattle, with similar intake, are associated
with common biochemical pathways at multiple levels of the tissues
metabolism. A combination of metabolomics fingerprint and targeted
lipidomics analysis was used to identify metabolites from animals
that differed with feed efficiency in duodenum, liver, subcutaneous
adipose, and longissimus-dorsi.

Results
Tissues Metabolomics
Profiling
Differences in metabolites
were identified between least-ADG and greatest-ADG animals (p < 0.05; see Supporting Information Table S1) in duodenum (n = 87), liver (n = 92); longissimus-dorsi (LD, n = 95),
and adipose (n = 52) tissue. The analysis of these
metabolites revealed specific metabolic pathways to ADG groups in
the duodenum, liver, adipose, and LD (Figures 1 and 2; see Supporting
Information Table S2). The α-linolenic
acid (ALA) metabolism was the most relevant metabolic pathway downregulated
in adipose, duodenum, and LD tissues (impact value = 1 and p < 0.05), whereas taurine and glutathione biosynthesis
were upregulated in hepatic tissue (impact value = 0.5 and p < 0.08) in greatest ADG compared to least-ADG animals.

with similar average dry matter intake according to Bos taurus KEGG
pathway database. UPLC-q-Tof MS metabolites identified to differ between
ADG groups by t-test (p < 0.05).

No common identified metabolites
were found in the four tissues
evaluated (Figure 3). However, alanine and ALA were downregulated in duodenum, LD, and
adipose tissues, whereas oleamide was upregulated in duodenum, LD,
and liver tissues, in greatest ADG compared to least-ADG animals (Figure 3). In addition, phosphatidylcholine
(PC) was upregulated in high-ADG animals in the four tissues but differed
within fatty acids (Supporting Information Table S1).

identified that differ between ADG groups by t-test
(p < 0.05).

Principal component analysis and score plot from supervised
partial
least square of discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were conducted on the
metabolites identified in the tissues. The analysis revealed a clear
clustering between least-ADG and greatest-ADG animals (Figure 4), which suggest that biochemistry
changed in the tissues according to cattle feed efficiency. The p-value for 1000 permutations was p <
0.05 in the tissues, indicating that the PLS-DA model was valid. For
the first component of PLS-DA, descriptive statistics from model fitting
by accuracy, estimates of the goodness of fit (R2), and estimates of goodness prediction (Q2) by tissue were: accuracy = 0.81, R2 = 0.52, and Q2 = 0.40 for
LD; accuracy = 0.75, R2 = 0.64, and Q2 = 0.42 for adipose; accuracy = 0.94, R2 = 0.94, and Q2 = 0.62 for duodenum; accuracy = 0.75, R2 = 0.77, Q2 = 0.39 for liver.

Phospholipids Quantification
in Tissues
On the basis
of the findings of the nontargeted metabolomic analysis, phospholipids
were quantified in liver (Table 1), duodenum (Table 2), adipose (Table 3), and LD (Table 4). The performance of phospholipids as biomarkers was
assessed using receiver–operator characteristic (ROC) curves.
According to the accepted classification of biomarker utility, the
area under the curve (AUC) was the metric used to assess the metabolites
as candidate markers.17

The concentrations
of compounds with the greatest sensitivity/specificity
for ADG differences were cholesterol and LPC-18:1 in liver (AUC =

in LD (AUC = 0.86; FDR = 0.03). Steers with the greatest ADG had lower
concentration of cholesterol and LPC-18:1 in liver and higher concentration
of PC-18/20:3 in LD than least-ADG steers.

No significant differences
(p > 0.05) in phospholipids
concentration were found in the duodenum and adipose tissues across
ADG classification. However, liver cholesterol concentration was associated
with cholesterol concentration in LD (r = 0.68; p < 0.01) and in duodenum (r = −0.67; p < 0.01), whereas liver cholesterol was not associated
with cholesterol concentration in adipose tissue (r = 0.03; p = 0.40).

Discussion
This
study represents the first comprehensive metabolome evaluation
based on phenotypic differences in cattle efficiency for four tissues,
duodenum, liver, adipose, and LD, combining metabolomics and targeted
lipidomics approaches. Previously,12 rumen
fluid was evaluated by UPLC-q-Tof MS metabolomics analysis associated
with univariate and multivariate statistical methods to identify metabolites
that differentiate steers with greatest ADG from least-ADG. On the
basis of this previous approach, metabolomics analyses in multiple
tissues on the same animals were conducted to provide evidence on
physiological mechanisms involved in differences in weight-to-gain
ratios in cattle with similar DMI. Furthermore, targeted lipidomics
analysis was conducted to support the metabolomics results and provided
valuable potential biomarkers for feed efficiency.

In the current
study, the compounds identified according to differences
in ADG, reflected the complexity and diversity of the metabolism in
different tissues. For instance, the adipose tissues presented 51
compounds mainly associated with fatty acid metabolism, whereas in
the liver 92 compounds were associated mainly with taurine and glutathione
metabolism. Indeed, no common identified metabolites were found across
the four tissues evaluated. However, ALA metabolism was downregulated
in adipose, duodenum, and LD tissues in animals with greatest ADG.
Lower level of ALA in more efficient animals might reflect more extensive
ruminal biohydrogenation as reported before in ruminal fluid and plasma
in the same animals.12 The ALA entering
tissues is rapidly accumulated, although a certain percentage of ALA
is subjected to desaturation or β-oxidation depending on the
tissues needs. For instance, longer n-3 fatty acids, such EPA or DHA
or others energetic carbons products, including ATP, monosaturated
fatty acids, and phospholipids.18 In vivo,
the two basic ALA metabolic fates are associated with the expressions
of lipogenic enzymes, substrate level, and product inhibition.19 Therefore, considering that in this study the
intake is similar between the two ADG groups, ALA levels in tissues
probably reflected a predominant catabolic fate producing more energy
in more efficient animals.

On the basis of fingerprint analysis,
glycerophospholipid (GLP)
compounds were the main lipid category, and their metabolism was displayed
in the four tissues evaluated. According to differences on GLP head
group, PC was the main phospholipid class in LD, liver, and adipose
tissue, whereas the GLP acyl chain length was widely distributed across
tissues. The specific functions of these GLP class/species are not
full elucidated. However, the fatty acid pattern of GLP membrane together
with the class distribution of phospholipids are major lipid-related
factors that characterize the properties and functions of the membranes,
including the regulation of transport processes, energy homeostasis,
and signal transduction.20 Thus, the GLP
profile is associated with diverse metabolic states. For instance,
the PC acyl chain length was associated with the concentrations of
glucose, insulin, leptin, and hepatic cholesterol in humans, and mice
fed a high-fat diet..21−23 Furthermore, in our results, a fatty acid amide synthesized
from phospholipids membrane, Oleamide, was upregulated in duodenum,
liver, LD, and previously, in rumen fluid.12 The fatty acid amines belong to a group of endogenous lipid mediators,
endocannabinoids, implicated on feed efficiency and carcass composition
of beef cattle.25 Considering GLP is not
only an energy-storage compound but also an interactive player in
various metabolic processes, we sought to quantify main phospholipids
species and cholesterol associated with ADG in cattle.

Phosphatidylcholine
is required for many energetic mechanisms such
as the efflux of triglycerides and cholesterol by VLDL and HDL, respectively.
In the hepatocytes, it also regulates fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol
oxidation.24 Indeed, the supplementation
of rumen-protected choline (as a precursor of phospholipids) reduced
triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver and increased milk yield
during the transition period in dairy ruminants.26,27 However, phosphatidylcholine has not been extensively studied in
beef cattle. Certainly, dietary supplementation with lecithin improves
the feed conversion rate in pigs on a high-fat diet during finishing
period,28 and rumen-protected choline supplementation
has been shown to promote weight gain and improve meat quality in
young lambs.29 In addition, differential
gene expression and transcripts already highlighted the importance
of phospholipids metabolism in cattle feed efficiency.30,31 Despite dietary phospholipids are extensively degraded by the rumen32 and PC concentration depends almost exclusively
upon endogenous synthesis,33 understanding
of the requirements of PC is needed to improve feed efficiency in
beef cattle.

The concentration of cholesterol is considered
a robust biomarker
of feed efficiency in cattle34,35 as consistent with
our results, lower cholesterol in liver and blood is associated with
more efficient beef cattle. Cholesterol concentrations in fact reflect
the capacity of synthesis, transport, and oxidation by the liver.36 Particularly in ruminants, cholesterol is derived
from hepatic de-novo biosynthesis,37 and
its major catabolism represents the bile acid synthesis.38 In our results, cholesterol oxidation products,
such as glycine or taurine conjugated, were in turn higher in the
liver of animals with greater ADG. Therefore, the excretion and reabsorption
of bile acid forms represent the basis of the enterohepatic circulation,
an essential mechanism for the digestion and absorption of fatty acids,
which likely relates to cattle feed efficiency.

By contrast,
the less efficient animal presented higher hepatic
concentration of cholesterol with an increase of glutathione metabolism.
The liver is the primary organ for the synthesis of glutathione from
glutamate, glycine, and cysteine and it is a major antioxidant, which
regulates the homeostasis of free radicals.39 Perturbations of glutathione status are usually a consequence of
oxidative stress and redox shift that impair liver function.40 Thus, the accumulation of cholesterol in the
liver may result in part from a decrease in cholesterol oxidation
and transport probably linked with hepatic performance.

In our
results, the concentration of cholesterol was positively
associated in liver and muscle. Despite the lack of information on
body composition or carcass traits in this study, improving cattle
feed efficiency potentially has a beneficial effect on carcass composition,
particularly for the human health aspect. Furthermore, metabolomics
results in LD from animals that are more efficient and presented a
higher level of creatinine and glucose and lower levels of lactic
acid and acetoacetic acid, which might reflect differences in muscle
metabolism. The physiological role of creatine in the skeletal muscle
is as an “energy shuttle” transferring ATP energy from
mitochondria to the myofibrils, whereas glucose contributes to an
intramuscular great proportion of acetyl units for fatty acid biosynthesis.41,42 In this experimental model, where diet and intake have been fixed,
group differences according to feed efficiency classification are
most likely involved with differences in cattle physiology and metabolism.
Hence, elucidating the metabolic mechanisms of muscle growth and development
associated with feed efficiency and more importantly developing the
ability to advantageously manipulate gain-to-intake ratios would allow
significant contributions to meat composition.

Conclusions
Overall,
lipid transport and oxidation were the main common metabolic
mechanism involved in weight-gain differences at multiple metabolic
levels of complexity in beef cattle notwithstanding the uniqueness
of the molecular composition of each tissue. Both mechanisms were
associated with the levels of ALA, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol
that could be considered as useful biomarkers (in other sample formats
e.g., blood, plasma) for feed efficiency in beef cattle. The integration
of the metabolomics profiles of tissues and metabolites points to
the hepatic function as an important metabolic crossroad that has
the potential to improve the gain-to-feed ratios.

Combining
analyses of multiple tissues may offer a powerful approach
for defining the molecular basis of differences in performance among
cattle for key production attributes

Experimental Procedures
Study
Design and Samples Details
This study was approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the
U.S. Meat Animal Research Center.

After weaning, steers (n = 144 Angus-sired) were housed in a facility with Calan
Broadbent electronic headgates (American Calan, Inc., Northwood, NH)
to measure individual feed intake. The diet consists on a DM basis,
of 8% chopped alfalfa hay, 20% wet distillers grains with solubles,
67.75% dry-rolled corn, and 4.25% commercial vitamin and mineral supplement;
the supplement contained monensin (Rumensin 80; Elanco Animal Health,
Greenfield, IN) to meet the nutrient requirements (NRC, 2016) and
provide a finished marketed carcass. Further details about the experimental
design were provided previously.12 Briefly,
feed intake was measured for 105 days in steers, and body weight was
measured on days 0, 1, 21, 42, 63, 84, 104, and 105 of the experiment.

After the end of intake study, steers received the same ration
ad libitum and remained in the same pen until slaughter (5–8
days). On the basis of the DMI and ADG data, steers were selected
according to differences in ADG (p = 0.01) with those
with the greatest ADG (n = 8; 1.96 ± 0.02 kg/day)
and least ADG (n = 8; 1.57 ± 0.02 kg/day), whose
dry matter intake was within 0.32 SD of the mean intake (10.10 ±
0.05 kg/day; p = 0.41). The final body weight of
the steers with the greatest ADG was 582.80 ± 52.06 kg and least
ADG was 596.80 ± 58.87 kg.

Steers were slaughtered 5 days
after the feeding period for 4 consecutive
days (4 animals/day). Before slaughter, steers had ad libitum access
to feed and water. Tissues were collected immediately after slaughter;
the mucosa layer was removed from the wall of duodenum with a sterile
scalpel blade from the small intestine from a section removed approximately
5 cm caudal of the cranial duodenal flexure; subcutaneous adipose
tissues were collected from the tail–head; liver samples were
collected from left lobule, and longissimus-dorsi (LD) from the section
adjacent from the 12th rib. All tissue samples were immediately placed
in liquid nitrogen, with storage at −80 °C after collection.

Nontargeted Metabolomics Analysis
Duplicate samples
of each tissues were extracted for metabolomics analysis. The extraction
procedure was adapted from Artegoitia et al.12 Briefly, tissues were individually pulverized with 6875D Freezer/Mill
(Spex sample prep; Metuchen, NJ), and 50 mg of each tissue was weighed
and diluted with 1 mL of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8 v/v),
vortexed, and centrifuged at 16 000g for 10
min at 4 °C. The supernatant and solid precipitate were separated
in different vials for aqueous (supernatant) and organic (precipitate)
extractions, respectively. For the aqueous extraction, the supernatant
was transferred to a new vial, dried under a nitrogen stream, and
resuspended in 500 μL of acetonitrile/water (9:1 v/v). For the
organic extraction, the solid precipitate was dissolved in 1 mL of
dichlormethane/methanol (3:1 v/v), centrifuged (16 000g, 10 min at 4 °C), dried under a nitrogen stream,
and resuspended in 500 μL in acetonitrile/water (9:1 v/v). The
ultra-performance liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS)
analysis was carried out using a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance
liquid-chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped
with an autosampler and coupled with a hybrid triple quadrupole-time
of-flight mass spectrometry (XEVO-G2-S-qTOF; Waters Corp.). Details
of instrument calibration, quality control samples, chromatogram separation,
and MS system parameters were carried out as described before.13

Quantitative Lipidomics Analysis
The phospholipids
were quantified in duodenum, liver, longissimus-dorsi (LD), and adipose
tissue by UPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry using an adapted
methodology.13 Briefly, phospholipids were
extracted from 50 mg of tissues using the Bligh and Dyer method.14 A mixture (1 μL) of deuterated phospholipids
(Avanti Polar 330707, Alabaster, AL) was used as an internal standard.
The calibration curves for lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC; Avanti Polar
83007, Alabaster, AL), lysophosphatidylamine (Avanti Polar 840081,
Alabaster, AL), phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar 330707, Alabaster,
AL), phosphatidylcholine (PC; Avanti Polar 840055, Alabaster, AL),
and cholesterol (Avanti Polar 700000, Alabaster, AL) were prepared
by serial dilution (8-fold) in water/methanol (1:9 v/v).

The
UPLC/MS analysis was carried out using a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance
liquid-chromatography (UPLC, Acquity BEH HILIC, 2.1 × 100 mm
× 1.7 μm; Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped with an autosampler
and coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (XEVO-TQS;
Waters Corp.). Details of instrument calibration, chromatogram separation,
and MS system parameters were carried out as described before.13

Data and Statistical Analysis
Data
processing and analysis
were conducted individually for each tissue. Raw data from the fingerprinting
analysis was aligned and normalized using total ion intensity using
Progenesis QI v1.0 software (Waters Corp.). The bovine Metabolome
Database (http://www.cowmetdb.ca/) was used to identify tissue’s compounds by using exact m/z values and retention times.

Data
were tested for normality and log transformed and standardized using
the Pareto scaling technique. The t-test, principal
components analysis, and partial least square of discriminant analysis
(PLS-DA) were conducted to identify and visualize differences of the
compounds identified between least-ADG and greatest-ADG animals using
MetaboAnalyst 3.0 software according to previously published recommended
statistical procedure for metabolomics analysis.15 Raw p-values were adjust by PROC MULTTEST
procedure of SAS 9.3 (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) and reported as fold
discovered rate (FDR) p-adjusted.

The Venn
diagram of the identified metabolites between ADG groups
was conducted across the four tissues.16 Pathway analysis was performed using a Bos taurus pathway library, which integrates global pathway enrichment analysis
and relative between centrality pathway topology analysis from MetaboAnalyst
3.0 software. The identification and visualization of the top altered
pathway were based on KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) database sources.

The concentration
of phospholipids was evaluated by t-test (p-adjusted), and a receiver–operator
characteristic curve (ROC) used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity
of potential metabolic biomarkers.17 In
addition, the association of cholesterol concentration among tissues
was evaluated by PROC CORR procedure of SAS 9.3 (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary,
NC).
