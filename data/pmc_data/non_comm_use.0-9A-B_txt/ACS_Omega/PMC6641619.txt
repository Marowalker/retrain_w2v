Azlactones
are versatile heterocycles employed in a diversity of
transformations; the main drawback of these cycles consists in the
epimerization of the α-carbonyl stereocenter during its preparation.
We hereby present a theoretical study to explain how the racemization
occurs. Two hypotheses were investigated: the keto–enol tautomerism
and the base-mediated racemization, through an enolate intermediate.
The results showed that the latter is consistent with the experimental
data and can spontaneously occur at room temperature. The same pathway
was evaluated for 2-alcoxy azlactone, showing a slower epimerization
ratio, consistent with the literature data.

Introduction
Azlactones (also known
as oxazolones) are five-membered ring heterocycles
that have recently been employed in several different transformations
in organic synthesis (Chart 1).1,2 The versatility of these compounds is related
to the presence of different reactive sites, bearing both electrophilic
and pronucleophilic moieties, thus allowing its use in the stereoselective
synthesis of α,α-amino acids, complex heterocycles, and
natural products.3,4 An important aspect concerning
these cycles is the presence of an acidic hydrogen (pKa ≈ 9), which is attributed to the aromatic character
of its enol tautomer.5,6

in Black) and Its Enol
Tautomer
Although a one-pot
procedure for the preparation of azlactone rings
has been reported,7 the traditional approach
for the attainment of these products consists of two steps: first,
acylation of amino acids, followed by intramolecular cyclization mediated
by a carboxylic acid activator.8 Furthermore,
a very interesting aspect about oxazolones bearing a hydrogen linked
to C4 is that, to the best of our knowledge, a racemization-free synthesis
has never been achieved when the C2 substituent is an aryl or alkyl
group, even when employing a single amino acid enantiomer as the initial
substrate.9 In the few reports involving
enantiomerically pure oxazolones,10,11 a modification
of the C2 substituent of the cycle is necessary to make racemization
less likely to occur, affording 2-alcoxy-azlactones by the cyclization
of carbamate-protected amino acids.12

The epimerization process is well-known to occur in oxazolones
and is widely explored in ring-opening dynamic kinetic resolution
(DKR)-catalyzed reactions, in which the racemization process is faster
than the subsequent reaction, allowing the isolation of stereoenriched
products.13,14 Interestingly, almost all of these previous
works use a base-derived catalyst, containing one or more basic groups,
such as ureas, thioureas, squaramides, and above all, tertiary amines
(such as cinchonas).15−21 Despite the epimerization being known for many years, an explanation
of the reasons that lead to this high tendency to racemization and
the steps in which it occurs are still unclear in the literature.

Recently, our research group has been studying the reactivity of
oxazolones in various transformations,22−26 including alternatives for amino acid derivative
formation, avoiding an azlactone intermediate and thereby the racemization
process.9 Nevertheless, we have been curious
about the epimerization process. In this context, we herein present
a theoretical study, based on experimental evidences, in an attempt
to provide new insights to explain the behavior of the azlactone ring
and the nature of this racemization process.

Results and Discussion
Initially, we decided to perform an experiment to study if the
racemization process occurs during the azlactone preparation or after
oxazolone use in a further reaction. Therefore, in an attempt to be
able to observe the epimerization process occurrence by crude proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) data, l-isoleucine
was chosen as an ideal substrate because it contains two stereocenters,
and thereby the epimerization of the α-carbonyl hydrogen would
result in a pair of diastereomers.

The azlactone synthesis followed
the two-step traditional methodology
reported in the literature,27 as shown
in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Azlactone
Preparation Using l-Isoleucine as the Substrate
Although harsh reaction conditions
were employed during the first
step (extremely acidic or basic conditions), no apparent racemization
was detected by 1H NMR (Figure 1A). On the other hand, the intramolecular
cyclization step leads to complete epimerization, with a diastereomeric
ratio of 1:1 by 1H NMR (Figure 1B). On the basis of these data and the DKR
racemization process, we hereby suggest two different possible pathways
for the epimerization process: an intramolecular tautomerization of
the azlactone ring, which could spontaneously and continuously occur
after the cyclization because of the lower pKa value of the lactone α-carbonyl hydrogen when compared
to that of the N-benzoyl amino acid; a base-mediated
racemization, involving a deprotonation/protonation step; it is also
worth mentioning that during cyclization, the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC) urea is formed as a byproduct and that this
compound has both the urea and a tertiary amine moiety and might act
as the base for the racemization process. This second possibility
would also explain why DKR reactions of azlactones were, with one
exception,28 only achieved by the use of
basic catalysts.

showing no apparent epimerization; (B) 1H NMR of the azalactone
ring, evidencing complete epimerization.

We decided to carry out a theoretical study of both possible
pathways.
All electronic structure calculations were performed with the Gaussian
09 package.29 Minimum energy conformations
for reactants, products, transition states (TSs), and molecular complexes
(MCs) were determined in the gas phase on the density functional theory
(DFT) level30 with the hybrid B3LYP functional31 and employing the 6-31G(d) basis set. The same
level of theory was also applied to the Gibbs free energy prediction
and to the vibrational frequency calculations. TSs were optimized
using the Berny algorithm32 and confirmed
to have only one imaginary frequency. All calculations were performed
at a pressure equal to 1 atm and at a temperature of 298.15 K, similar
to the conditions usually employed in DKR experimental reports.

Single-point energy calculations using the previously optimized
geometries were performed in gas phase, water, and dichloromethane
using the B3LYP-D3 functional,33 the 6-31++G(d,p)
basis set, and the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum
model (IEFPCM) approach.34 ΔGsol° could then be obtained by the sum of the three energy contributions
shown in eq 1 1  in which the terms are, respectively, the
electronic energy, thermal correction to the enthalpy and entropy,
and solvation Gibbs free energy.

To allow a comparison with
the experimental data, 1H
and 13C NMR were also calculated for azlactone keto and
enol isomers. For this purpose, the gauge-independent atomic orbital
method35 was employed, using the previously
optimized geometries in the gas phase and performing single-point
calculations employing the B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2pd)-IEFPCM-chloroform
level of theory. The chemical shift could be obtained employing the
following equation 2  

We decided to carry out the
studies in two different azlactones:
alanine and valine derivatives. To confirm that the optimized geometries
were satisfactory, we compared the infrared (IR), 1H, and 13C NMR data obtained for the keto tautomer and observed a
good correlation with the experimental data (see the Supporting Information). Furthermore, a comparison of the
natural bond orbital and the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the
keto, enolate, and enol forms has been done, and the results are summarized
in the Supporting Information. As expected,
it is possible to observe that in general, the enolate bond orders
and lengths are an average between the keto and enol tautomers.

The first investigated pathway was the keto–enol tautomerism
of the cycle.36−39 During this step, the TS could not be found for any of the azlactones
(alanine or valine) employing the B3LYP level of theory. However,
by employing the same basis set and changing from DFT to Hartree–Fock
or M06-2X, it was possible to obtain the desired TS, with only one
imaginary vibrational mode frequency representing the reaction coordinate.
Thus, a single-point calculation at B3LYP-D3 was performed employing
the optimized TS on the M06-2X level.

The pathway showed a high
activation barrier, of more than 75 kcal/mol,
incompatible with a reaction that should proceed at room temperature.
Besides, no significant differences were observed for the two azlactones
(Table 1). Furthermore,
the inclusion of the solvation model (for both water and dichloromethane)
showed little effect on the overall energies of this reaction.

[12.2]	11.6 [12.2]	
The second hypothesis consisted in a pathway, in which
the enolate
is formed from the keto azlactone and then reprotonated, affording
the enol tautomer (Scheme 2).40−43 In this case, a base is necessary for the reaction to proceed. Because
both the EDC urea and almost all reports of DKR catalysts have a tertiary
amine moiety, we choose to work with a model of a tertiary amine:
the triethylamine. We also investigated the role of the formation
of MCs between the base and the cycle in all steps during the reaction,
in an attempt to evaluate the influence of these species in the activation
barriers. An interesting observation consisted in the absence of a
TS for the reprotonation of the enolate into the enol form for both
azlactones (the barrier was lower than kT, in which k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the
temperature). Thus, to characterize these points, a rigid scan for
the proton transfer was performed and corroborated with this proposal
(see the Supporting Information).

Scheme 2 Azlactone
Base-Mediated Pathway
Some important intramolecular contacts could be observed
during
the formation of MCs and the TS (highlighted in red—Figure 2). The structure
of MC1, TSketo–enolate, and MC2 showed similar interactions,
with considerable differences in C–H (1.10, 1.61, and 2.05
Å, respectively) and N–H (2.40, 1.19, and 1.06 Å,
respectively) bond lengths, showing the hydrogen transfer from the
heterocycle to the base. The angles between these three atoms have
a slight difference in the MC1 (167°) when compared to the TS
and MC2 (174° and 176°). In MC2, the approximation of the
positive and negative charged species (formation of an ion-pair) results
in further stabilization when compared to the isolated molecules.
The MC3, in which the azlactone is in the enol form, is stabilized
by the formation of a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of the
amine (N–H length 1.67 Å and N–H–O angle
172°).

racemization of alanine- and valine-derived azlactones. B: triethylamine;
BH+: protonated triethylamine; MC1: MC keto + base; MC2:
MC enolate + BH+; MC3: MC enol + base.

An overview of the results for the alanine-derived azlactone
in
dichloromethane is summarized in Figure 2. For the keto tautomer, it is possible to
observe a substantial difference between the Gibbs free energy of
the isolated species and the MCs (4.4 kcal/mol); the approximation
between these reactants reduces the activation energy for the deprotonation
from 14.3 to 9.9 kcal/mol, making it a relatively low barrier that
can be transposed at room temperature. Furthermore, the MC2 is very
close in energy to the TS (only 2.3 kcal/mol), making the reverse
reaction spontaneous and thermodynamically favored; it is worth mentioning
that during this return, the epimerization process takes place, affording
either R or S stereocenters without selectivity. From the enolate,
it is also possible for the reaction to continue toward the enol tautomer
in a barrierless and spontaneous process, with ΔG of −5.5 kcal/mol. The reversibility of this step is also
possible under the studied conditions.

This pathway is viable
and explains the experimental observations,
with reaction barriers that can be transposed at room temperature.
The results for Gibbs free energies, enthalpies, and electronic energies
for both azlactones are shown in Table 2. This proposal suggests that the DKR catalysts, in
addition to the known importance in favoring the stereoselective ring-opening
reaction, are also necessary for the racemization process of the azlactone
ring.

As shown in Table 2, is possible to observe
that in all comparisons of activation barriers
for enolate formation, the racemization process in alanine azlactone
proceeds faster than in valine-derived oxazolone when considering
the formation of MCs. Another interesting observation is that for
both azlactones, the reaction activation barriers are 1–5 kcal/mol
lower when considering the MC instead of the isolated species.

Because of the lower energy barriers, in this path, all steps can
occur forward and backward at room temperature; what will drive the
keto and enolate tautomers percentage are the differences in the Gibbs
free energies. Thus, through the Gibbs distribution calculation shown
in eq 3, it is possible
to calculate de %keto and %enol forms 3  with R = 0.001987 kcal mol–1 K–1 and T = 298.15
K.

The result of the percentage of each species is shown in Table 3. It is possible to
observe that only the keto tautomer can be detected in significant
amounts, with only traces of the enol form. This observation is consistent
with the experimental data obtained by IR, 1H, and 13C NMR (available in the Supporting Information), which shows only the presence of the keto tautomer. Furthermore,
theoretical calculations for a wide scope of different C2- and C4-substituted
azlactones were carried out, showing the same behavior (in all cases,
the %keto is higher than 99.999%), and the results are
available in the Supporting Information.

Finally, both pathways were also
evaluated in dichloromethane,
considering a 2-alcoxy-substituted azlactone (data available in the Supporting Information). The results showed a
similar behavior, considering the tautomerism hypothesis (a barrier
of about 78 kcal/mol in both the gas phase and in dichloromethane)
not viable to occur at room temperature. In this case, the base-mediated
pathway for the deprotonation of the keto azlactone showed no TS and
a reaction Gibbs free energy of 20.3 kcal/mol in dichloromethane on
the B3LYP-D3 level of theory, about 8–9 kcal/mol higher than
in 2-phenyl substituted azlactones. This observation was expected
and explains why the epimerization process is less likely to occur
in 2-alcoxy azlactones, as reported in the literature.10,11

Conclusions
In summary, the study reported here pointed
out the mechanism behind
the epimerization process experimentally observed in azlactones. NMR
experimental evidences showed that no racemization occurs during the
acylation step, occurring only during or after the intramolecular
cyclization. On the basis of these observations, a DFT study employing
the B3LYP-D3/6-31++G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level was carried out. According
to the obtained data, we suggest that the epimerization process takes
place in a base-mediated equilibrium after the formation of the oxazolone
heterocyle. Even byproducts, such as the EDC urea, can act as a base
in this process, which explains the isolation of racemic azlactones
right after the intramolecular cyclization step. When the same pathway
was evaluated toward 2-alcoxy azlactone, the barrier for the epimerization
process is 8–9 kcal/mol higher when compared to a 2-phenyl
oxazolone, which corroborates with the experimental observations that
these azlactones have a slower epimerization ratio. Besides, an alternative
pathway for the racemization, involving the direct keto–enol
tautomerism of the α-carbonyl hydrogen was studied, and because
of the high barrier, it is not viable to happen at room temperature.

Furthermore, the percentages of keto and enol tautomers were calculated
for a wide scope of azlactones and are in perfect accordance with
the experimental data, showing only the presence of the keto form.
The reaction barriers showed great influence of the formation of MCs
between azlactones and the base.

Finally, we hereby suggest
a new role for the catalysts involved
in DKR reactions, in which, in addition to influencing the ring-opening
reactions in a stereoselective manner, these catalysts are also necessary
to mediate the racemization process.
