Multifunctional
freestanding membranes are prepared by tuning the
structure of ubiquitous soil components, viz. clay and humic acids.
Cross-linking of exfoliated clay layers with purified humic acids
not only conferred mechanical strength but also enhanced chemical
robustness of the membranes. The percolated network of molecularly
sized channels of the soil membranes exhibits characteristic nanofluidic
phenomena. Electrical conductivity is induced to otherwise insulating
soil membranes by heating in an inert atmosphere, without affecting
their nanofluidic ionic conductivity. The soil membranes also provided
a new platform to prepare and study mixed conducting materials. Strips
of heated membranes are shown to exhibit excellent sensitivity toward
NH3 gas under atmospheric conditions.

1 Introduction
Soil,
also known as the skin of the earth, is a highly complicated
but a synergic mixture of living and nonliving objects.1,2 It plays pivotal roles in the environmental chemical cycles and
provides a basis for the survival of life on earth. Among various
nonliving objects in soil, clays and humic acids (HAs) are the most
active constituents, and in spite of their drastically different chemical
and physical identities, they contribute similarly to the chemical
functionalities of soil. For example, both clays and HAs actively
participate in detoxification of hazardous substances, preservation
of vital minerals, and maintenance of ideal pH, fertility, and air/water
ratios for plant growth.1−6 Studies suggested that the activities of clay and HAs complement
each other and an appropriate combination of the two is essential
to obtain certain crucial functionalities of soil.1−10 Nonetheless, rational blends of these two naturally abandoned materials
have not been optimally applied with a view to creating advanced materials
for futuristic applications. Here, we attempt to utilize the ubiquitous
chemistry of HAs and clays to prepare multifunctional freestanding
membranes with application possibilities in the areas like nanofluidic
energy harvesting, water purification, and sensing of toxic chemicals.
To facilitate better interactions, layers of naturally occurring vermiculite
clay were exfoliated into ultrathin 2D sheets, and HAs were purified
through multiple steps of conjugative acid–base treatments.

Clays are stacking layers of hydrous aluminum phyllosilicates consisting
of corner-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra and/or AlO4 octahedra intercalated by aqueous solutions of charge-balancing
cations. Owing to their well-defined structures having high chemical
and thermal stability, clay minerals have received lots of attention
from the scientific communities across the disciplines. As a result,
they are being applied in a variety of advanced technologies such
as nuclear waste managements, industrial oil absorbance, pharmaceuticals,
and anticaking applications.11 Clays are
also highly tuneable and can be easily modified to create freestanding
proton-conducting membranes, ultrasensitive smart materials, and a
range of polymeric nanocomposites.12−15 On the other hand, HAs are mixtures
of acidic organic polymers that are believed to be a product of the
natural break-down process of plant- and animal-based materials.16,17 There have been significant contradictions regarding the origin
and structure of HAs. However, their favorable contributions toward
environmental chemical cycles have been proven beyond doubt. The phenolic
and carboxylic functional groups of HAs together with negative surface
charges of clay layers are the major contributors of the cation exchange
capacity of soil, and hence, contents of the two are a primary characterization
of soil nature. Unfortunately, the application of HAs in advanced
technologies is limited by its complicated and undefined structures.
They are being utilized as a cheap source of carbon, either to generate
heat through combustion or to prepare porous materials by annealing
at an inert atmosphere.18,19 Scant efforts have
been made to utilize the large number of functional groups inherently
present in HAs for advanced technological applications. Notable applications
of HAs include adsorbents of inorganic and organic pollutants from
water and additives to fertilizer, paper, and plastic materials.20−22

2 Results and Discussions
HAs, the mixtures
of acidic organic polymers that are believed
to be a product of the natural break-down process of plant- and animal-based
materials,16,17 were extracted and purified following
the standard alkaline-acid treatment-based procedure.23−25 The purified HA samples displayed infra-red (IR), UV–vis,
and fluorescence spectra similar to those reported in the contemporary
literature (see Figure S1).25−28 IR bands at 3424, 2928, 1655, and 1030 cm–1 suggest
the presence of −OH, −CH, −C=C, and C–O–C
groups in the sample, respectively. Clays are stacking layers of hydrous
aluminum phyllosilicates consisting of corner-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra and/or AlO4 octahedra intercalated by an aqueous
solution of charge-balancing cations. Owing to their well-defined
structures along with high chemical and thermal stability, clay minerals
have received lots of attention from the scientific community across
the disciplines. As a result, they are being applied in a variety
of advanced technologies such as nuclear waste management, industrial
oil absorbance, pharmaceuticals, and anticaking applications.1,26 Natural vermiculite (Al,Mg,Fe3+)4(Si,Al)8O20(OH)4, a smectite group 2:1 clay,
is used here as the model clay system; the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern of the same is shown in Supporting Information, Figure S1c.1 A two-step ion exchange
method was employed to obtain a homogeneous aqueous dispersion of
the clay sample as shown in Figure S1a.
The microscopic analysis of the dispersion (discussed on Figure S2) confirmed the successful exfoliation
of clay layers into thin flakes having heights in the range of 4–8
nm with lateral dimensions extending up to 20 μm.2

Aqueous dispersions of exfoliated clay
layers and purified HAs
were mixed at different ratios and their colloidal stability was monitored
over a period of 3 months. Pure HAs and vermiculite dispersions started
settling down after around 24 undisturbed hours; in contrast, HA–vermiculite
dispersions remain stable up to 3 months, indicating favorable interactions
between the two; photos of the dispersions are compared in Figure 1a,b. Such augmentations
of colloidal stability of bulk clay particles induced by HAs are already
documented in the relevant literature.1,29−32 HAs bind to clay particles through the following modes of interactions—(a)
anion exchange to clay edges, (b) cation- or water-bridges to clay
surfaces, (c) H-bonding to the surface Si–OH groups, and (d)
van der Waals forces. Although unbound hydrophilic side chains of
HAs assist dispersion of clay particles in water, the surface charges
of clay layers prevent agglomeration of HAs into polymeric particles.
Exfoliation of bulk clay particles into nanoflakes increases not only
surface-to-volume ratios but also the number of defect sites necessary
to interact with HAs. Similarly, multiple steps of purification should
free more functional groups in HA to interact with clay layers, and
hence, a pronounced cross-linking between the two is expected. A hypothetical
model depicting interactions between HA functional groups and silica
sheets of exfoliated clay layers is shown in Scheme 1.

Figure 1 Photographs showing aqueous dispersions of HA,
VM, 20% HA, 30%
HA, and 50% HA at (a) day 1 and (b) day 90.

Scheme 1 Schematic Showing Probable Interactions of HA Functional Groups
with
Silicate Sheets of Exfoliated Vermiculite Layers
The diverse cross-linking possibilities of HAs
and exfoliated clay
layers should yield highly robust composite materials. Seeking a proof
of this concept, dispersions of HAs and exfoliated vermiculite layers
were mixed in different weight ratios (20, 30, 50, and 70% HAs) and
vacuum-filtrated through commercial filtration membranes to obtain
freestanding membranes. A photo of the as-prepared membrane containing
50% HA (50% HA) is shown in Figure 2a. Soil composites up to 50% HA contents gave highly
robust freestanding membranes, but the composite with higher than
50% HA yielded fragile membranes, which tend to break easily and hence
not considered for future applications. Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) examination on the cross section of the soil membrane
revealed its lamellar structure; a representative image of the same
is shown in Figure 2b. The lamellar structures of membranes are also supported by the
presence of reflections in the range of 2θ = 6.5°–5.8°,
in their respective powder XRD patterns (Figure S3). The interlayer spacing of the soil membranes calculated
by applying Bragg’s law was found to be in the range of 1.2–1.6
nm. The bar diagrams in Figure 2c show bending stiffness values of the membranes calculated
by the Lorentzen & Wettre two-point method,14,33 described in Figure S4. The stiffness
values of the soil membranes were found to increase with increasing
HA content in it. The cross-linking of exfoliated vermiculite with
HA functional groups should prevent the sliding of vermiculite sheets
from their specific position, resulting in higher values of stiffness.
The stiffness of the soil membranes was found to be also dependent
on the atmospheric humidity level or presence of solvent vapors. As
described in the Supporting Information (Figure S5a), in the presence of acetone and ethanol, the stiffness
of the membranes decreases, but it increases with increasing humidity
level in the atmosphere (Figure S5b). The
synergic effect of HAs and exfoliated clay layers was also established
by comparing the tensile strength values of the soil membranes with
that of a pure vermiculite membrane (Figure 2d). While the tensile strength values of
20, 30, and 50% HA membranes were found to be 2.4, 3, and 4 times
higher than that of a pure vermiculite membrane, respectively, pure
HAs did not yield any membrane upon vacuum filtration. The higher
tensile strength values of soil membranes over pure vermiculite membranes
can also be attributed to the cross-linking effect (Scheme 1) of HAs. The cross-linker
prevents sliding of the vermiculite sheets from their specific position
to improve the mechanical properties. However, in the membranes with
higher than 50% HAs, the cross-linker dominates over vermiculite fractions
of the composites and hence the tensile strength values follow the
opposite trends. For the same reason, soil samples with HA content
significantly higher than that of the two-dimensional vermiculite
flakes do not yield freestanding membranes. The stress–strain
curve of the composite membranes is compared with that of a pure vermiculite
membrane in Figure S6. Cross-linking of
clay layers by HAs also fetched extraordinary underwater stability
to the soil membranes. To verify underwater stability in a realistic
condition, small pieces (20 mm × 4 mm × 0.045 mm) of membranes
were dipped into water and vigorously shaken for 2 h. While the pristine
vermiculite membrane was disintegrated into an aqueous dispersion
within 10 min of shaking, all composite membranes remained unperturbed. Figure 2e shows photos of
the soil membranes that survived for 30 days in water after 2 h of
vigorous shaking. Membranes with high solution stability are vital
for applications like water purification, fuel cells, nanofluidics,
and solution-based catalysis. Involvement of surface −OH groups
on the cross-linking process is also supported by the diminishing
intensity of the IR band corresponding to −OH groups in the
composite membranes as compared to that of purified HAs and exfoliated
vermiculite samples, shown in Figure S7.

stiffness and (d) tensile strength of soil membranes with different
compositions. (e) Photographs showing solution stability of soil membranes

Distinct XRD reflections at the low-angle region of the soil
membranes
indicate periodic stacking of the layers with well-defined interlayer
spacing. Such minuscule spaces in the 1–2 nm regime decorated
with diverse organic and inorganic functional groups should exhibit
unique molecular and/or ionic transport properties. Soil-based nanofluidic
devices were fabricated by encapsulating rectangular soil strips into
a freshly prepared polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer, see Experimental Section. In Figure 3a, current versus voltage (I–V) curves recorded with the soil-based nanofluidic device (50% HA)
with three different KCl concentrations are plotted. The linearity
in the I–V curves confirmed the formation
of a percolated network of nanofluidic channels across the soil membrane.
Conductivity values of the nanofluidic devices were calculated from
the respective I–V curves at different salt
concentrations and were compared with bulk electrolyte solutions.
As can be seen from Figure 3b, the conductivity of the bulk solution varies linearly with
concentration. In a clear contrast, conductivity of the soil membranes
exhibits two distinct features. At high concentrations, it increases
linearly with increasing salt concentrations, but for the salt concentrations
below 0.1 M, conductivity remains unperturbed even after several orders
of magnitude change in the concentration (from 0.1 to 10–6 M). This behavior of concentration-dependent ionic conductivity,
also known as surface charge-governed ionic transport, is a characteristic
signature of nanofluidic channels.12,34 Nanofluidic
membranes exhibiting surface charge-governed ionic transport up to
0.1 M salt concentration along with ease of fabrication and scaling
up could be suitable for various technological applications. Soil-based
nanofluidic membranes are also employed to harvest green energy from
concentration differences. For that, devices comprising two compartments
separated by a soil membrane were fabricated by using the PDMS elastomer,
shown in the Figure S8a,b. Both compartments
were filled with 2 mL of aqueous KCl solutions of different concentrations,
1 M in the high- (CH) and 10–3 M in the low (CL)-concentration chamber.
Two Ag/AgCl electrodes were inserted into the electrolyte solutions
to measure the transmembrane potentials and diffusion currents across
the soil membranes. The transmembrane potentials recorded as a function
of time for different soil membranes are shown in Figure S8c. Immediately after applying the concentration gradient,
each of the devices displayed a maximum open-circuit potential which
declined with time to reach equilibrium at around 0.22, 0.19, and
0.15 V for 20, 30, and 50% HA membranes, respectively. Such potential
differences obtained through nanofluidic membranes are attributed
to the concentration gradient-driven selective cation transport across
the membranes.35 The equilibrium power
outputs across the membranes were calculated by using eq 1 to be 2.85, 1.46, and 1.2 W m–2 for 20, 30, and 50% HA, respectively, which are around
50% higher than those reported earlier for graphene oxide membranes.36 1  where Vm and I0 are the membrane potential and zero-volt current,
respectively, and A is the diffusive membrane area.
The stability in power output by soil membranes was ascertained by
repeating the experiment several times, and the transmembrane potentials
obtained on 1st and 8th cycle are shown as a function of the HA content
in Figure 3c. Soil
membranes displayed remarkably high cation transference numbers 1.00,
0.94, and 0.97 for the 20, 30, and 50% HA membrane, respectively,
calculated by using eq 2. 2  where, Ediff is
the stable membrane potential of the device at 8th run, R is the universal gas constant, T is the room temperature, z is the no. of moles of electrons, F is
the Faraday constant, and CH and CL are the concentration of the salt solution
at high- and low-concentration chamber, respectively. As the stability
of the soil membranes plays a vital role in these kinds of applications,
the stability of soil membranes in energy-harvesting devices was evaluated
by exposing the same to electrolyte solutions for several days. The
device composed of the pure vermiculite membrane collapsed within
12 h, whereas the devices composed of composite membranes remained
stable up to 10 days as demonstrated in Figure S10. Soil membranes were also tested for harvesting green energy
from natural ion sources such as food waste, lime juice, and simulated
seawater. Figure 3d
shows power obtained by adding natural ion sources to the high-concentration
chamber while filling the low concentration chamber with deionized
water.

nanofluidic device at different KCl concentrations (b) ionic conductivity

devices and bulk solution. (c) Trans-membrane potential of soil membranes

ion sources by employing a 50% HA membrane-based nanofluidic device.
Bar diagrams showing (e) ion permeation efficiency of soil membranes.
(f) Permeability of liquids through different soil membranes.

The molecularly thin nanofluidic
channels of soil membranes enriched
with surface charges also enable the selective cation transport behavior.
Aqueous solutions (50 ppm) of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl were vacuum-filtered
through composite membranes (thickness 44 microns), and the concentration
of the cations in the filtrate was determined by using a flame-photometer
instrument. The bar diagrams in Figure 3e, showing concentrations of the cations permeated
through the composite membranes, clearly illustrate the ion-selective
nature of the membrane. For example, through the 70% HA membrane,
a K+ ion with a hydration radius of 3.3 Å was transported
2 and 3 times higher than that of Na+ and Li+ ions with hydration radii of 3.6 and 3.8 Å, respectively. The
same trend of ion permeation was also followed by 20, and 50% HA membranes.
In spite of smaller interlayer spacing (d = 1.37
nm), the pure vermiculite membrane did not show notable selectivity
toward any particular cations. The rich chemical functionalities of
HAs in the soil membranes are also utilized to separate cationic dyes
from aqueous solutions. To investigate the efficiency of dye separation,
60 mL solutions of 100 ppm methylene blue (MB) dye were passed through
soil membranes (30 μm), and the concentrations of the dye molecules
were measured before and after passing through each membrane by employing
UV–visible spectroscopy. The soil membranes could easily remove
up to 60 mg of the dye molecule as illustrated in Figure S9. Remarkably, soil membranes exhibit much higher
removal efficiency under vacuum-assisted filtration than its absorption
capacity, by dipping the membranes in the dye solution. A 50% HA membrane
(weight 10 mg) could remove up to 61.2 mg of MB dye under the vacuum
filtration method, while it could absorb only 12.24 mg when soaked
in an aqueous dye solution of similar concentrations for 2 h, suggesting
the same to be a filtration process and not absorption. From the time
required to vacuum-filter the dye solution, the liquid permeability
of the soil membranes of different compositions was calculated. As
shown in the bar diagram of Figure 3f, the permeability of the 70% HA membrane (4.25 ×
10–5 mm g cm–2 s–1 bar–1) was found to be slightly higher than that
of other membranes.

As both HAs and clay are electrically nonconducting,
pristine soil
membranes are insulating in nature. However, electronic conductivity
has been induced to the soil membranes by heating them under a N2 atmosphere. Figure 4a shows the I–V curve of the heated
strips measured by painting conductive silver paste on either end.
Moreover, conductivities of the heated soil membranes were found to
be linearly dependent on the HA contents in the starting mixture,
see Figure 4b. The
electrical conductivities obtained as such are attributed to the removal
of the organic functional groups from HAs during the heat treatment
process, which is also apparent from the color transformation of soil
strips from brown to black; digital photos of a 50% HA strip before
and after annealing at 550 °C is shown in the inset of Figure 4a. Also, the appearance
of a G band in the Raman spectra of heat-treated soil strips, shown
in Figure S11, suggests the enhancement
of graphitic/amorphous carbon ratios in the samples, which can lead
to a continuous network of graphitic carbon in the sample. The removal
of organic functional groups from HA on heat treatment is further
supported by comparing the IR spectra of the heated HA with that of
the preheated HA as shown in Figure S12. The conversion of the carboxyl functionality is demonstrated by
the disappearance of a sharp carbonyl peak at 1653 cm–1. The heat treatment also reduced the interlayer spacing of soil
membranes from 1.6 to 1.29 nm, shown in Figure S13. A characteristic I–V curve of the heated pure HA shown in Figure S14 confirms the induction of electrical conductivity in heated
HA. At present, the electrical conductivity of the heated soil samples
is very low. However, for applications like chemical sensing or biosensing,
more than higher values of conductivity, higher change in conductivity
(with respect to change in the external atmosphere) is important.
Moreover, tuning the composition and annealing temperature can further
improve conductivity of the soil membranes. It is noteworthy that
the high-temperature annealing process that fetched electrical conductivity
to the soil strips did not affect its nanofluidic ionic conductivity.
The residual functional groups of soil components are found to be
sufficient to exhibit surface charge-governed ionic transport as shown
in Figure 4c. Systems
with such interpenetrating ionic and electronic conductivity have
large potential for technological applications. The mixed conducting
properties of heated soil strips were studied by measuring the conductivity
at different relative humidity (RH) by employing an impedance analyzer
(Multi Autolab/M204 potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with a FRA32M
module) in the frequency range from 500 kHz to 1 Hz, with a perturbation
voltage amplitude of 100 mV. Representative Cole–Cole plots
obtained for the device made from the heated soil strip at different
RHs are shown in Figure 4d. Total conductivities (σ) of the membrane were calculated
by using the formula σ = L/(R × A), where L is the distance
between the two electrodes and A is the cross-sectional
area of the strip. The alternating current impedances (R) were obtained by fitting the data of the Cole–Cole plot
to an equivalent circuit shown in Figure S15; a similar device geometry and equivalent circuit have been employed
earlier to study mixed conducting properties of graphene oxide-reduced
graphene oxide-based membranes.37 As shown
in Figure 4e, total
conductivity decreases with decreasing RH of the atmosphere, suggesting
ionic (proton) conductivity as a major contributor to the overall
conductivity of the heated soil strips.

50% HA strip toward different concentrations of ammonia vapor is compared

Freestanding mixed conducting membranes prepared from low-cost
starting materials with tunable electrical conductivity could be ideal
for gas sensing applications. A soil-based gas-sensing device was
fabricated by connecting two Cu wires to silver paste painted on both
ends of a rectangular soil strip (50% HA) of dimensions 20 mm ×
6 mm × 0.045 mm. The soil device thus prepared was placed in
a closed aluminum container as illustrated in the schematic of Figure S16. The electrical resistance of the
same was recorded as a function of time using a source meter instrument.
Calculated amounts of ammonia vapor were introduced into the chamber
through a liquid injection syringe. The real-time response curve recorded
for the heated soil membrane at four different concentrations of NH3 vapor is shown in Figure 4f. The heated soil membrane showed 80% responsiveness
toward 20 ppm of ammonia vapors. The high sensitivity of the heated
soil membrane toward ammonia vapors can be attributed to smaller flake
sizes, higher defect density, and larger interlayer spacing. However,
under similar conditions, the heated soil membrane did not show any
sensitivity toward ethanol and acetone vapors.

3 Conclusions
The work here demonstrated that naturally abundant soil components
can be engineered to prepare advanced materials for futuristic applications.
Clay layers exfoliated by ion-exchange methods were cross-linked by
purified HA molecules to yield mechanically robust soil membranes
possessing great potential toward solution-based applications. The
percolated network of the ultrathin nanochannel exhibiting fascinating
transport properties could find applications in the areas of selective
molecular/ionic transport, catalysis, energy harvesting, and storage.
The interpenetrating ionic and electronic conductivities of heated
soil membranes prepared from dirt cheap raw materials by employing
a straightforward and scalable method could provide a new platform
to study mixed conducting materials. Such materials could be ideal
in the areas like solid-state fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors,
gas sensing, and separation. Exhaustive investigations into various
ways of tuning soil chemistry may also provide means to alter the
quality of the soil in natural environments.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Raw vermiculite crystals,
potassium chloride, and MB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium
hydroxide, sodium chloride, and lithium chloride were purchased from
Alfa Aesar. Hydrochloric acid and ammonium solution were purchased
from Merck.

4.2 Exfoliation of Clay Layers
Natural
vermiculite clay was exfoliated into atomically thin flakes by employing
a two-step ion-exchange method. Typically, 50 mg of thermally expanded
vermiculite crystals was refluxed with 100 mL of saturated solution
of NaCl for 24 h, followed by washing with deionized water (DI water)
5–6 times. The as-obtained Na+ ion-exchanged clay
was further refluxed with 2 M aqueous solution of LiCl (100 mL) for
24 h. Li+ ion-exchanged vermiculite was vigorously washed
with DI water (5–6 times) to remove the free ions.

4.3 Extraction of HAs
A two-step alkaline-acid
treatment was adopted to extract HA from samples of soil collected
from the IITG campus. Typically, 100 g of the soil sample was stirred
with 300 mL of 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution at room temperature for
2 h. The soil components were then allowed to settle overnight and
the supernatant liquid (200 mL) was collected, which was further centrifuged
(5000 rpm) to confirm removal of undesired components. The clear solution
was then acidified with concentrated HCl to decrease the pH value
to 1. At pH 1, a brown-colored material started precipitating, which
was collected by centrifugation and the washing procedure was repeated.

4.4 Preparation of Soil Membranes
Aqueous
dispersions (1 mg/mL) of exfoliated vermiculite and HAs were mixed
in appropriate proportions to prepare soil dispersions containing
20, 30, 50, and 70% of HAs by weight. For example to prepare 60 mL,
20% HA membrane, 12 mL of HA dispersion (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 48
mL of VM dispersion (1 mg/mL) and sonicated for 5 min. Around 60 mL
of soil dispersions was then vacuum-filtered through cellulose nitrate
membranes to prepare freestanding membranes, which were detached from
the filtration membranes after air-drying at room temperature.

4.5 Fabrication of the Nanofluidic Device
Soil membrane-based
nanofluidic devices were fabricated by encapsulating
rectangular soil strips (20 mm × 8 mm × 0.045 mm) into the
freshly prepared PDMS elastomer. To expose the nanochannel networks
to different electrolyte solutions, two holes (∼0.3 mL) were
cut open through the fully cured PDMS stub at either end of rectangular
strips. After soaking soil devices in water for 8 h, aqueous solutions
of KCl (∼0.3 mL) were placed at both ends and allowed to reach
equilibrium before measuring ionic conductance. A Keithley source
meter instrument (model 2450) connected to Ag/AgCl electrodes was
employed to record the conductivity data.

4.6 Cation
and Dye Filtration through Soil Membranes
Hundred ppm and
fifty ppm aqueous solutions (4 mL) of MB dye and
inorganic salts were passed through soil membranes by a vacuum-assisted
filtration technique, respectively. Aqueous dye solutions (100 ppm)
(4 mL) were passed through each soil membrane, and the time required
to collect the filtrate was noted to test the permeability of the
membranes. The concentration of the dye before and after passing through
soil membranes was determined by using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
instrument (SYSTRONICS, UV–vis spectrophotometer 117). Similarly,
the concentrations of the cations were determined by employing a flame
photometer instrument (Analab, μFlameCal10).

Permeability
of the membranes were calculated by employing the equation 3  

4.7 Characterization
Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (PerkinElmer spectrum two) was employed to characterize
the functional groups present in HAs. The morphology of HAs and the
exfoliated vermiculite layers were characterized by FESEM (Zeiss,
Model: Sigma), transmission electron microscopy (JEOL, JEM 2100),
and atomic force microscopy (Agilent, model 5500 series). X-ray diffraction
characterization was carried out by using Bruker D-205505 Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Tensile strength measurements
of the soil membranes were carried out in a 5 kN electromechanical
universal testing machine (make: Zwick Roell: Z005TN).
