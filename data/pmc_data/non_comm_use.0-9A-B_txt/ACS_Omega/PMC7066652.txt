A cyclometallated phosphorescent
iridium-based probe to detect
CN– was prepared through a cyanide alcoholize reaction
based on the C^N type main ligand and N^N type ancillary ligand (2-phenyl
pyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline-5-carboxaldehyde, respectively).
The efficient probe exhibited good sensitivity in response to CN– in an CH3CN and H2O (95/5) mixture
within a 1.23 μM detection limit. The response of PL is directly
in line with the concentration of CN– from 0 to
2.0 equiv. The PL investigation of other reactive anions proved the
great selectivity to CN–. Additionally, upon adding
1.0 equiv. of cyanide, the formation of cyanohydrin was correctly
elucidated in 1H NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectra studies.
The conspicuous results indicate that the iridium complex has the
potential possibility of application in other biosystems related to
CN–.

Introduction
Cyclometallation is
a studied reaction in coordination and organometallic
chemistry used to synthesize organometallic complexes normally.1−9 Recently, there is an extensive concern utilizing diversified transition-metal
complexes as fluorescent molecular probes to selectively detect anions.10−14 Cyclometallated iridium(III) complexes have exciting photophysical
properties because of the listed key advantages: (i) the precursors,
in which the main ligand and ancillary ligand are facilely synthesized
with higher productivity; (ii) the high stability, visible excitation
wavelengths, large Stokes shifts, long lifetimes, and lower self-quenching
in contrast to traditional organic materials, which are applied in
some latent areas such as luminescent devices, detecting probes, and
chemosensors.15−28 Therefore, studying the composition and adhibition of cyclometallated
phosphorescent iridium(III) complex probes has a significant meaning
in many areas.

Cyanide is a seriously toxic inorganic anion
that is harmful to
the human health and environment.29,30 Despite its
extreme toxicity, chemical compounds including cyanide were extensively
applied in gold mining, electroplating technology, and multiple diverse
industrial areas, they yet bring the unavoidable environmental issues.31,32 Cyanide’s particular affinity can be applied in the design
of fluorescent probes that have the electron-deficient carbonyl unit
(C=O), finally forming cyanohydrin.33 Consequently,
many works were performed to discover specifically susceptive probes
on the basis of iridium(III) complexes to detect and sense cyanide
and apply in the lighting area.34 For example,
in a previous study, based on the Michael addition reaction and FRET
mechanism, a battery type of “turn-on” probe was investigated
and adapted to dual channels to test cyanide anions.35

These specific factors have aroused our interest
to develop the
electron-deficient carbonyl unit iridium(III) complex probe to be
applied in the rapid response and high-sensitivity sensing of CN–. We herein report a cyclometallated phosphorescent
iridium complex probe based on 2-phenyl pyridine as the C^N type main
ligand and 1,10-phenanthroline-5-carboxaldehyde as the N^N type ancillary
ligand, which is widely used in the selective detection of cyanide.
The simple model of ligands assists us to elucidate the effects of
the formation of cyanohydrin.36−40 The response of PL is directly in line with the concentration of
CN– from 0 to 2.0 equiv. In addition, the great
plane geometry of ligands is conducive to the geminated of single
crystals of the phosphorescent iridium complex. The primary research
shows that the complex can act as a probe for cyanide detection in
great sensitivity and selectivity.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of the Iridium Complex
The target product
was synthesized based on the C^N type main ligand and N^N type ancillary
ligand (2-phenyl pyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline-5-carboxaldehyde)
(Scheme 1). The target
iridium complex was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C
NMR spectra, and molecular structure represented in X-ray diffraction
analysis, demonstrating that the target complex is successfully synthesized.
In comparison to the iridium complex, after adding the CN–, there was a remarkable shift disappearance at δ 10.56 ppm
belonging to the aldehyde proton, suggesting the occurrence of the
cyanide alcoholize reaction at the aldehyde group. Meanwhile, a new
peak at δ 8.60 ppm appeared, belonging to the formation of the
cyanohydrin proton signal (−CH(CN)OH). In FT-IR spectra studies,
a characteristic absorption band in the 1701 cm–1 of the iridium complex was referred to the remarkable vibration
of the C=O bond. Meanwhile, the C=O absorption band unsurprisingly
disappeared after adding the CN–. This is consistent
with the formation of cyanohydrin through the cyanide alcoholize reaction.

are in the Experimental Section.

Crystal Structure of the Iridium Complex
To elucidate
the plane structure of the cyclometallated iridium(III) complex, the
single-crystal X-ray analysis was employed. Through the method of
addition of n-hexane in the saturated dichloromethane
complex solution, the single crystal was obtained for X-ray diffraction
analysis. The iridium complex crystallized in the orthorhombic space
group Pna21 (Figure 1). The crystallographic data and the structure
refinement parameters are collected in Table 1. Partly bond lengths (Å), bond angles
(°), and torsion angles (°) are collected in Table 2. The structure shows a typical
distorted-octahedral geometry environment within the iridium(III)
center coordinated by chelating the cyclometallated 2-phenyl pyridine
ligand and C and N atoms and ancillary ligand. The formation of the
cyclometallated iridium complex makes it have the higher air and thermal
stability. The bond lengths of Ir–C, in the range of 1.987
(11) to 2.015 (12) Å, and Ir–N of the complex, in the
range of 2.024 (9) to 2.157 (9) Å, are both within the value
at the foregone scope of the semblable complex.41 Compared to the Ir–N, the Ir–C bond length
is shorter, revealing the forceful interaction in the metal Ir center
and C atom. Within the complex, the pyridine rings of the cyclometallated
ligand are approximately coplanar with a dihedral angle of 8.7°.
Noncovalent intermolecular interaction in the crystal stacking structure
of the complex is observed.

Detection of CN– in Aqueous Acetonitrile Solution
First, we studied the
PL response of the probe to CN– including variable
proportion of acetonitrile and water, and detailed
information is attached in (Figure 2). The probe displayed the most obvious fluorescence
enhancement in the CH3CN and H2O (95/5) mixture,
while the fluorescence response to the probe increased with increasing
proportion of water in the mixture solution and decreased after reaching
the maximum value. Owing to the obvious change, we described in detail
the conditions of the probe in the CH3CN and H2O (95/5) mixture.

and the probe (20 μM) in the presence of 20 μM CN– in 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 50, and 99% acetonitrile at 298
K (λex = 380 nm). The green columns show the intensity

nm of the probe with [CN–] (0–2.0 equiv.)

Detection of CN– by the Probe in UV–vis
and PL Emission Spectra
The iridium complex displays remarkable
color variation in the presence of CN–. The UV–vis
absorption and phosphorescence titration spectra of the iridium complex
were explored. Reaction condition optimization of the probe (20 μM)
was performed by using the incremental addition of CN– (0–2.0 equiv.) as the model substrate in an CH3CN and H2O (95/5) mixture at ambient temperature. From
the UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure 3), the strong absorption at 267 nm was ascribed
to the singlet transitions, and a main absorption band at 380 nm was
attributed to a metal ligand charge transfer (MLCT). Upon the addition
of CN–, the absorption peak at 380 nm gradually
emerged with a slight increase from the original absorption. This
phenomenon is reasonable because cyanide can strongly attack the electron-deficient
carbonyl unit (C=O) to form cyanohydrin. Therefore, this reaction
would affect the state of MLCT, which resulted in the changes of emission
properties.

The fluorescence titration
experiments for CN– were as well used in the same
condition of 20 μM solution
of probe in CH3CN/H2O (v/v = 95:5). In the PL
emission titration experiment, the probe exhibits weak fluorescence
(ΦPL = 6.6%) in the absence of CN– at an excitation of 380 nm, referring to aldehyde quenching through
photoinduced electron transfer (PET).42 After adding CN– (0–2.0 equiv.), the probe
displayed an obvious fluorescence enhancement with increasing concentrations
of CN– at 570 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield
(Φ) of the probe was increased to 28.0% in the presence of CN– (1.0 equiv.), while the fluorescence intensity reached
its maximum at 2 equiv. of CN–, with a 15-fold enhancement.
Moreover, once the CN– was added, the color of probe
solution turned from pale yellow to bright orange under a 365 nm UV
lamp. The phenomenon indicated that the probe could easily detect
CN– by the “naked eye”. Notably, the
fluorescence response is directly in line with the concentration of
CN– in the range of 0 to 40 μM, in which I570 = 95.57CCN– + 88.80 (the unit of C is μM, R2 = 0.984) (Figure 4), revealing that the probe can be used in
the quantitative testing of CN–. Furthermore, the
calculated detection limit was 1.23 μM (S/N = 3, N = 10),43 significantly lower than the
allowable limit (1.9 mM) set by WHO. The detection limits of different
types of probes are listed in Table 3.

Fluorescence
Quantum Efficiency
In order to enable
both the probe and reference material to be compared in the same situation
that all the substances have parallel absorption, we chose 9,10-diphenylanthracene
as the method of comparison at 380 nm excitation light to measure
the fluorescence quantum efficiency. Photophysical characterization
data for the probe are listed in Table 4. The high quantum efficiency showed that the complex
has excellent fluorescence properties and has potential applications
in biosystems.

Effect of Reaction Time
Inspired
by the excellent results
of the probe to detect CN–, we began to turn the
observation to the measurement of reaction time. The optimization
results are shown in Figure 5. When the CN– was not added to the system,
the PL intensity of the probe remained unchanged (curve a). When added
with varying concentrations of CN–, the response
time became orderly accelerated (curves b, c, and d). When added with
a 1.0 equiv. concentration of CN–, the PL response
increased from 20 to 120 s and eventually attained its maximum at
130 s (curve e), indicating that the probe has a great timely response
to CN–.

and after adding varying concentrations of CN– (a:

in an CH3CN and H2O (95/5) mixture at 298 K
(λex = 380 nm).

Selectivity of the Probe for CN–
To estimate
the selectivity conditions of the probe for CN–,
a range of possible competitive anions, like Br–, Cl–, I–, NO3–, OAc–, CO32–, NO2–, SO42–, S2O32–, H2PO4–, OH–, SCN–, SO32–, HSO3–, S2–, Cys, HS–, and N3–, were also examined. Even at a higher concentration
(100 μM), there was no significant emission intensity change
after adding a range of competitive anions covering more nucleophilic
ones like SCN–. Moreover, after the cyanide was
added, the color change was observed by the naked eye (Figure 6). A remarkable fluorescence
enhancement was observed after addition of 40 μM CN– (Figure 7). These
results suggested that the phosphorescence changes of the probes were
selectively induced by CN–, which could be used
to detect CN– without interference from another
biological anion.

probe to other anions. The red columns show emission of adding CN–.

Recognition Mechanism of
the Probe for CN–
To elucidate the possible
PL increasing mechanism, the
reaction of the probe with cyanide was investigated. The probe and
the probe-CN– adduct (in dry DMSO-d6) were dissolved in an NMR tube and then characterized
at 25 °C by 1H NMR. After adding 1.0 equiv. of cyanide,
there was a remarkable shift disappearance at δ 10.56 ppm belonging
to the aldehyde proton (H*) signal, suggesting the occurrence of the
cyanide alcoholize reaction at the aldehyde group. Meanwhile, a new
peak at δ 8.60 ppm appeared, belonging to the formation of the
cyanohydrin proton signal CH(CN)OH(H*). The aldehyde phenanthroline
ring proton peaks of the cyclometallated ligand are shifted upfield.
The signals for a (9.76 ppm) and c (9.07 ppm) were shifted to 9.869
and 8.529 ppm, respectively; at the same time, the signal for b (9.13
ppm) gradually disappeared and together with d (8.32 ppm) and e (8.25
ppm) to emerge a new signal at 8.17 ppm. In theory, the conjugation
would be reduced after the formation of cyanohydrin. Additionally,
the signals of phenyl pyridine aromatic protons did not change basically
(Figure 8). The mechanism
makes clear that one new substance (CH(CN)OH) was created in the reaction.

Figure 8 1H NMR mechanism of the cyanohydrin species formation.
Inset: spectra showing the probe and adding 1.0 equiv. of CN– in DMSO-d6. The asterisks represent
the specific proton signals.

The probable formation mechanism of the cyanohydrin substance has
been lucubrated based on the above experimental findings and former
reports. Upon adding 1.0 equiv. of CN–, aldehyde
reacted with cyanide to give the cyanohydrin. The process incorporates
three main steps; the electron properties of the aldehyde obtained
from the probe make it susceptible to CN– attack
on the carbonyl group by forming cyanohydrin. The studies of a similar
process were reported previously (Figure 9). Moreover, the data for ESI-HRMS spectra
were coincident with 1H NMR spectra. The mass spectra clearly
displayed the characteristic peak of resultant cyanohydrin in a 1:1
molar ratio of probe to CN– (Figure S4).

Figure 9 Possible mechanism for the formation process of cyanohydrin.

DFT Theoretical Studies
To further
understand the optical
physical properties of the complex, density functional theory (DFT)
was employed to study the theoretical electronic structures. The molecular
orbital chart of the complex is provided in Figure 10. The highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) resides principally at the Ir center and the pyridyl part of
the cyclometallated ligand, while the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) is essentially located in the 1,10-phenanthroline-5-carboxaldehyde
ancillary ligand because of the electron acceptability of substituents
and conjugation of the aldehyde group to the phenyl portion. In addition,
the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is 3.01 eV; the partial molecular
orbital energy values of the complex are summarized in Table 5.

Fluorescence Imaging of CN– in Living Cells
Besides, we made an inquiry about the ability
of the probe to monitor
CN– within living cells. Before the research of
fluorescence cell imaging, the cytotoxicity of the probe was tested
in A549 cells. Cells were dipped to an increasingly proportion of
every probe for 24 h, and cell viability was measured through the
MTT assay. Results exhibited small cytotoxicity until a concentration
of 60 μM incubated for 24 h (Figure 11). Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the probe
even at a higher concentration of 100 μM incubated for 8 h was
studied. The cell viabilities of the probe were mainly over 80% within
100 μM concentration (Figure 11). These results made clear that the cytotoxicity of
the probe in the concentration scope is negligible and was sufficiently
appraised for their potential biological imaging applications. After
being incubated with a 10 μM probe for 20 h at 37 °C, as
shown in Figure 12A, the cells dipped with the probe emerged with feeble PL, indicating
that the probe had the ability to permeate the cell membrane. Cells
were dipped in 10 μM CN– for 0.5 h; after
being incubated in the 10 μM probe for 20 h at 37 °C, the
cells had an intense PL emission compared to no added cells (Figure 12B). DIC imaging
of the probe expounded that the cells were alive in the whole experiment
process. These results suggest that the probe has cellular permeability
and could be employed to imaging CN– in living cells.

probe at 37 °C (λex = 405 nm, solvent: DMSO/H2O (v/v 1/1000)).

Detection of CN– in Test Strips of Practical
Samples
Inspired by the admirable properties of the complex
to detect CN–, we developed test strips to apply
for the signaling of CN– of practical samples. Test
strips (2.0 cm × 2.0 cm) were impregnated with the probe (1 mM
in CH3CN/H2O (v/v = 95:5)), affording a filter-paper-based
test strip for the sensing of CN–. A drop of (10
μL) variable proportion of CN– (c = 0.5 to 2.0 mM) was placed in probe-impregnated test strips. As
displayed in Figure 13, spots of pronounced colors were observed that could be easily discernible
to the naked eye and under 365 nm UV excitation. This observation
implied that the probe could be used as a preliminary sensing kit
by variable proportion of CN– in practical samples
and demonstrated the pragmatic application value of the complex infiltrated
test strips for in situ immediate cyanide visibility detection.

the test strip image under (A) daylight and (B) 365 nm
UV excitation of the probe with varying proportions of CN– (c = 0 to 2.0 mM) in CH3CN/H2O (v/v = 95:5).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we described a new type of probe based on the iridium
complex for the detection of cyanide. The probe exhibited good sensitivity
to CN– in an CH3CN and H2O
(95/5) mixture within the 1.23 μM detection limit and timely
response. The response of PL is immediately in line with the concentration
of CN– from 0 to 2.0 equiv. The PL investigation
of other reactive anions proved the great selectivity of the probe
for CN–. In addition, upon adding 1.0 equiv. of
cyanide, the formation of cyanohydrin was exactly illuminated by 1H NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectral studies. The conspicuous results
indicate that the iridium complex has the potential possibility of
application in other biosystems related to CN–.

Section
General Data
All operations were carried out in standard
Schlenk techniques under the nitrogen atmosphere. Chemicals were used
as commercial products without further purification. The precursor
salt of CN– was tetra-n-butylammonium
cyanide ([CH3(CH2)3]4N+CN–). 1H NMR and 13C NMR (500 MHz) spectra were measured in a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer.
UV–vis absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra were measured
in a UV 765 spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-4600, respectively.
FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT-IR spectrophotometer.
[(C^N)2Ir(μ-Cl)]2 was synthetized based
on the literature.44

Synthesis of
the Iridium(III) Dimer Complex [(C^N)2Ir(μ-Cl)]2
The mixture of 2-phenyl pyridine
(2 mmol, 2 equiv.) and IrCl3·3H2O (1 mmol)
in 2-ethoxyethanol/water (3/1) mixture (12 mL) in a 50 mL Schlenk
tube under a nitrogen atmosphere was heated for 24 h at 120 °C.
After cooling, a bright yellow precipitate was filtered and washed
with water, ethanol, and n-hexane. The crude product
was used in the next reaction without further purification in good
yields.

Synthesis of the Iridium Complex
A mixture of the iridium(III)
dimer complex [(C^N)2Ir(μ-Cl)]2 (0.1 mmol)
and 1,10-phenanthroline-5-carboxaldehyde (0.22 mmol) was stirred at
room temperature in 10 mL of dichloromethane and methanol (1/1) mixture
overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. After that, an excess of KPF6 (0.6 mmol) was stirred for 1 h. The crude product was purified
by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2:methanol
= 30:1) to get the orange iridium complex 1 in moderate
yield. 1: orange solid, 78% yield. 1H NMR
(500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 10.59 (s,
1H), 9.77 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 9.15 (s, 1H), 9.10
(d, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 8.33 (d, J =
5.0 Hz, 1H), 8.26 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 3H), 8.15 (dd, J = 8.1, 5.2 Hz, 2H), 7.96 (d, J = 7.6
Hz, 2H), 7.88 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H), 7.50 (dd, J = 12.3, 5.6 Hz, 2H), 7.07 (t, J = 7.2
Hz, 2H), 7.00–6.93 (m, 4H), 6.28 (dd, J =
6.8, 4.5 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6): 193.42, 167.24, 153.43, 151.64, 149.82, 148.52, 144.47,
140.81, 139.24, 136.34, 131.71, 130.73, 130.27, 128.68, 128.46, 125.56,
124.33, 122.95, 120.46. Elemental analysis calcd for C35H24F6IrN4OP: C 49.24, H 2.83, N
6.56; found: C 49.31, H 2.75, N 6.52.

FT-IR Spectra
A solution containing 1.0 equiv. of CN– was dropped
to a 20 μM solution of iridium complex
in CH3CN and was utilized for the FT-IR measurements.

X-ray Crystal
A Bruker Smart APEX CCD diffractometer
was used to extract information on the complex by graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data were recorded
at ambient temperature, and the direct methods were applied for the
structure, which was optimized in F2 through
SHELXL.45 Absorption correction was performed
using SADABS.46 All non-hydrogen atoms
were refined anisotropically. The positions of hydrogen atoms were
computed. The Bruker program Smart was used for all calculations.

Theoretical Calculations
The computational method was
applied using the Gaussian 03 program package on account of density
functional theory (DFT). The B3LYP was adopted for the optimization
of the complex structure. The LANL2DZ and 3-21G* basis sets were adopted
to analyze the Ir atom and the rest of the atoms.47 In order to comprehend the properties of the excited state,
the contours of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals were plotted.

Cell Culture
The A549 cells were placed in glass Petri
dishes in a density of 80,000 cells per dish and then cultured in
the RPMI Medium 1640 replenished with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin for 20 h at 37 °C in CO2/air (5:95). The probe (10 μM) was appended to the unit
milieu and preincubated in DMSO/H2O (v/v = 1:1000) for
4 h, and then tetrabutylammonium cyanide (10 μM) was added and
incubated for 0.5 h. After incubation for the corresponding time,
the cells were washed with PBS to wipe off the dissociative compound
and ions before analysis. Fluorescence imaging was executed by a confocal
microscope (LSM 880). For the probe channel, the excited wavelength
was 405 nm, while the emission wavelength was collected in the range
of 550–650 nm.
