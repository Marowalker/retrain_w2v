Recently,
electromagnetic (EM) shielding (EMS) window, especially
the ultrathin, transparent EMS active layer, has been the primary
objective of extensive studies because of its widely potential applications
in stealth technology, high radiation pollution, and others. However,
several defects, including opacity and large thickness, have severely
restricted the application in optical EMS devices. Herein, we developed
an ultrathin and highly transparent EMS active layer on a rigid glass
and a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate by chemical doping
CVD (chemical vapor deposition) graphene with nitric acid (HNO3) as the P-type dopant, which has a 91% transmittance and
1/1000 thickness compared to the conventional EMS active layer. The
HNO3-treated graphene shows excellent EMS efficiency by
a factor of 4.5, significantly compensating for the adverse effects
of the grain boundaries between CVD graphene crystals. Additionally,
55% HNO3 is the most suitable for achieving high EMS effectiveness,
which can be significantly improved by treating for only 5 min. This
unique chemical-doping CVD graphene holds potential for being exploited
as a transparent active layer in numerous EMS applications.

1 Introduction
Electromagnetic (EM) pollution
has become a serious problem because
of the rapid development of electronic equipment, which has attracted
enormous attention to invent efficient EM shielding (EMS) materials.
Conventional EMS materials contain metal foil, metal mesh, conductive
coating, and conductive composite materials, although they can achieve
high EMS effectiveness (EMSE), but these materials are more than tens
of microns in thickness and opaque,1 which
are greatly limited by the application in some special fields such
as aerospace, microelectronics, and ultrathin. The EMSE of the conventional
conductive coating is only 3 dB μm–1.2

Considering the unique features such as
corrosion resistance, lightweight,
and easy processing, much attention has been attracted to develop
new graphene composite and their applications in EMS materials.3−7 The EMSE of PS/graphene composite with 3.47 vol % graphene can reach
48 dB.5 For the lightweight polyetherimide
(PEI)/graphene composite foams, its EMSE varies from 17 to 44 dB/(g/cm3) in the range of 8–12 GHz.8 The graphene-based lightweight shielding materials are of outstanding
EMS performance. The addition of magnetic particles such as Fe3O4 can increase the absorption efficiency.9−14 However, the thickness of the graphene composite is too high to
be used in ultrathin devices.

Generally, most of the EMS active
layers are currently black, opaque,
and thick in micron scale. The contradiction between thickness and
transparency of the conventional shielding material restricts its
application in nanoelectronic devices15,16 and transparent
conductive windows by which not only EM waves can be shielded, but
also the situation inside the shielded room can be observed. So, it
is necessary to develop ultrathin and transparent EMS materials. For
instance, Batrakov et al. successfully proposed a ∼241 nm thick
pyrolytic carbon film which can absorb about 50% microwave.17 In addition, Wu et al. also fabricated a 4 μm
carbon nanotube film, and its EMSE can achieve 61–67 dB.18 In addition, Kim et al. deposited silver nanowires
in polyimide surface to produce a conductive network, the EMSE of
the fabricated film is 55 dB with a transmittance of 58%, and the
thickness of the film is less than 10 μm.1 The materials reported above are expected to be used in
ultrathin devices, but these materials are difficult to produce in
large scale, which seriously hinders its application. The materials
reported above are expected to be used in ultrathin devices. Furthermore,
it is still difficult to produce such graphene EMS on a large scale
which still constitutes a major obstacle in the practical applications,
especially for excessive use.

Graphene is a two-dimensional
material with only a carbon monolayer
composed of sp2 hybrid carbon atoms with a honeycomb-like
lattice. Its electrical conductivity at room temperature and monolayer
transmittance are as high as 2 × 105 cm2 V–1 s–1 and 97.7%.19,20 Graphene is expected to be an excellent shielding material because
of its excellent electrical property. For example, Song et al. have
fabricated conductive graphene paper used as an ultrathin shielding
material;21 the EMSE of the graphene paper
can reach 19.0 dB with 0.1 mm in thickness and can reach 46.3 dB with
0.3 mm in thickness. Shen et al. developed an ultrathin graphene oxide
film with 8.4 μm in thickness which shows excellent EMSE of
20 dB.22 Kim et al. introduced the EMS
effectiveness (SE) of the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets interleaved
between PEI films fabricated by electrophoretic deposition.23 Lu et al. investigated the EM interference (EMI)
shielding performance of multilayer graphene (without doping)/polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) structure at 18–26.5 GHz.24 Zhao et al. designed an optically transparent shielding
enclosure by integrating indium tin oxide with graphene/quartz substrates,
which effectively suppresses the cavity-resonant modes, and the shielding
enclosure may cause EMI.25 Wen et al. reported
high-efficiency EMI shielding of light-weight RGOs at elevated temperatures.26 Cao et al. found that ultrathin and lightweight
graphene composites exhibit high-efficiency microwave absorption at
elevated temperatures. Besides, they reported that the imaginary part
ε″ of a relative complex permittivity of samples could
be regarded as the complex contributions of both the relaxation εp″ and the
conductance εc″, and the ratios of εc″ and εp″ show strong temperature-dependence
at elevated temperatures.27

The chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) method is an efficient way
to grow graphene in large scale. It is expected to be used as an ultrathin
and transparent EMS material. Hong et al. demonstrated that the EMSE
of the monolayer CVD graphene is 2.27 dB which can shield 40% of the
incident waves.28 The EMSE value per unit
thickness of graphene is 7.73 dB nm–1 which is more
than 7 times greater than that (1.04 dB nm–1) of
the gold film. The theoretical conductivity of ideal monolayer graphene,
estimated by using the plane-wave theory, is known to be 108 S m–1.19 They calculated
that the theoretical value of EMSE for ideal monolayer graphene should
be 16.5 dB, which can shield 97.8% waves. However, the migration of
carrier is hindered because of the grain boundary or other defects,
which reduces the EMSE of CVD graphene.

Chemical doping method
has been used to improve the conductivity
of the carbon-based materials such as graphite and carbon nanotube
film.29,30 The previous work shows that doping with
nitric acid (HNO3) can significantly increase the conductivity
of graphite.31 In our work, we used HNO3 as the P-type dopant to improve the EMSE of the CVD graphene.
Results show that the EMSE of the trilayer graphene is increased by
a factor of about 4.5 after 55% HNO3 doping for 30 min,
and the thickness of the EMS active layer, with a transparency of
up to 91%, is reduced to about one-thousandth of the thickness of
the usual EMS active layer. We also discussed the best doping conditions
of HNO3 for achieving high EMSE.

2 Results
and Discussion
The schematic diagram of the polymethyl methacrylate
(PMMA)-assisted
transfer method is shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, graphene was successfully transferred onto transparent
PET films and glass substrates by the PMMA-assisted method. The transferred
1–3-layer graphene on PET was denoted as PET/graphene-N (N = 1, 2, and 3). PET/graphene-N-PMMA and PET/graphene-N (N = 1, 2, and 3), respectively, denoted graphene with preserving and
removing PMMA on the surface of transferred graphene. The transferred
graphene is of high transmittance, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. For the light
with the wavelength of 1000 nm, the transmittance of PET/graphene-1-PMMA
is up to 91%, which is slightly lower than that of ideal monolayer
graphene.20Figure 2d indicates that the graphene stack on glass
substrate also shows higher transmittance.

Figure 4 shows
the
Raman spectra of the 1–3-layer graphene EMS active layer on
the PET film. The ratio of the intensity of 2D and G bands (I2D/IG) is used to
identify the layers of graphene.32,33 As shown in Figure 4, I2D/IG > 1 for once transferred
graphene (Figure 4a), I2D/IG = 1 (Figure 4b) for twice transferred
graphene, and I2D/IG < 1 for thrice transferred graphene (Figure 4c). These values of I2D/IG indicate that
the graphene stacks in Figure 4a–c include monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer graphene,
respectively.

(N = 1, 2, and 3).

PMMA was used to assist the transfer of graphene in this
work.
The effect of removing PMMA on the EMSE of graphene was considered,
and the graphene stacks preserving PMMA were first studied. Figure 5 shows the EMS properties
of PET/graphene-1-PMMA, PET/graphene-2-PMMA, and PET/graphene-3-PMMA.
The results show that both PET and PET/PMMA films have almost no EMSE
in the range of 8.2–12.4 GHz. In the same test band, the EMSE
of the stack PET/graphene-1/PMMA with one layer of graphene varies
in the range of 2.8–5.1 dB, which indicates that only one layer
of graphene in the test band has obvious EMSE. In the same test band,
the EMSE ranges of PET/graphene-2/PMMA and PET/graphene-3/PMMA are
5.0–7.2 and 6.8–9.2 dB, respectively. After each stacking
of one layer of graphene, the EMSE increases by about 2 dB, which
suggests that the EMSE approximately increases linearly with the number
of graphene layers. The stacks with 1–3 layers of transferred
graphene can, respectively, shield ∼50, ∼70, and ∼80%
EM waves under the test band.

Figure 5 EMSE of PET, PET/PMMA, and PET/graphene-N/PMMA
(N = 1, 2, and 3).

For PET/graphene-N/PMMA stacks, we found
that
three ways can contribute to the attenuating EM waves: (1) PMMA impedance
is close to that of air, but the impedance of PMMA is very different
from that of graphene. Therefore, when the EM wave reaches the surface
of graphene through PMMA layer, the reflection attenuation of EM wave
occurs on the surface of graphene. (2) An unreflected EM wave undergoes
absorption attenuation when passing through graphene. (3) When the
EM wave passing through a layer of graphene reaches the surface of
another layer of graphene in the multilayer graphene stacks, the reflection
attenuation occurs again within the stacks because of the differential
impedance between the PMMA and the graphene. Multiple reflection attenuations
of this part of the EM wave will take place within the stack. In addition
to the protection of graphene in the transfer process, the PMMA layer
sandwiched between two layers of graphene can also act as an impedance
mutation layer between graphene layers, causing the EM wave to be
reflected multiple times within the stacks.

Figure 6 shows that
the EMSE value of multilayer graphene stack is significantly higher
than that of monolayer graphene. However, PET/graphene-N/PMMA needs to be superimposed layer by layer. Alternatively, we
stacked three PET/graphene-1/PMMA stacks together and tested their
EMS properties. The results indicate that the EMSE value of three
sheets of PET/graphene-1/PMMA is higher than that of PET/graphene-3/PMMA,
indicating that the transfer process for a three-layer stacking of
PET/graphene-1/PMMA has a relatively lower damage to the integrity
of graphene.

samples (3-layer stacking).

There are grain boundaries in CVD graphene because of the
different
crystal orientations of the Cu substrate and the growth patterns of
CVD graphene.34 As one kind of defect,
the grain boundary hinders the migration of carrier, and then reduces
the carrier concentration,35,36 resulting in a lower
conductivity of CVD graphene compared with that of the ideal graphene.
The EMSE of graphene is related to its conductivity,37 and the EMSE is calculated as follows: 1   2   3   4  where, SER, SEA, and
SEB are the reflection loss, the absorption loss, and the
reflection loss inside the shield, respectively. E0(H0) and E1(H1) are the electric fields
(magnetic field) intensity at the point with and without shields,
respectively. μr is the magnetic permeability of
the shielding material relative to the vacuum. σr is the conductivity of the shielding material relative to the ideal
copper. f is the EM wave frequency (Hz). d is the thickness of the shielding material (cm). Equations 3 and 4 indicate that the EMSE of the shielding material increase
with the conductivity.

Chemical doping method is one of the
effective ways to improve
the conductivity of carbon materials. HNO3 has been demonstrated
to be an effective P-type dopant to improve the conductivity of graphite
and carbon nanotube film.31,38,39 The doping mechanism is described as follows30,40 5  

Because graphene and graphite (or carbon nanotube)
essentially
have the same chemical component and structure, HNO3 was
used to dope CVD graphene to improve its EMSE. As a P-type dopant,
the electron is transferred from the graphene to the HNO3, creating a hole in graphene. The carrier concentration of graphene
increases for the shift of the Fermi level, thus improving the conductivity.

Before HNO3 doping, we first use acetone (according
to section 4.3) to remove PMMA from the surface
of graphene so that the surface of graphene becomes the outermost
layer for easy doping. After the removal of PMMA, the EMSE of graphene
with and without HNO3 doping is shown in Figure 7. The effects of removing PMMA
on EMS efficiency and graphene integrity were analyzed by comparing Figures 5 and 8.

Figure 7 EMSE of PET/graphene-N before and after HNO3 doping: (a) PET/graphene-1, (b) PET/graphene-2, and (c) PET/graphene-3;
SEA and SER of PET/graphene-N before and after HNO3 doping: (d) PET/graphene-1, (e)
PET/graphene-2, and (f) PET/graphene-3.

Figure 8 Optical micrographs of graphene stacks: (a) PET/graphene-1/PMMA
and (b) PET/graphene-1.

The results show that the EMSE of the graphene with removing
PMMA
is lower than that of the graphene without removing PMMA. The EMSE
of three layers of graphene without PMMA is one third of the EMSE
of three layers of graphene covered with PMMA. In addition, after
removing PMMA, the EMSE decreases with an increase in the amount of
transferred graphene, which is opposite to the effect laws of the
number of transfer layers on the EMSE when PMMA is not removed (Figures 5 and 8). This diametrically opposed phenomenon is mainly because
of the damaging effect of the removal of PMMA on the integrity of
graphene, which can be observed from the optical micrographs of graphene
stacks (Figure 8).

Figure 9 shows the
effect of HNO3 doping on the EMSE of graphene stacks. The
results indicate that HNO3 doping is an efficient way to
improve the EMSE of graphene. After doping, the EMSE of the PET/graphene-1
is improved from 3.0–5.2 to 4.5–7.5 dB (increased by
about 1.5 times); the EMSE of the PET/graphene-2 is improved from
1.7–3.7 to 5.6–7.9 dB (increased by about 3 times);
and the EMSE of the PET/graphene-3 is improved from 1.9–3.2
to 9.8–12.6 dB (increased by about 4.5 times). The EMSE increases
nonlinearly with the number of the graphene layer. From 1 layer to
3 layers, the increasing amplitudes vary from 1.5 to 4.5 dB, which
means the more the number of transferred graphene layers, the more
obvious the effect of HNO3 doping on the enhancement of
the EMSE. The doping efficiency of monolayer graphene is relatively
lower because HNO3 molecules can only dope on the graphene
surface. For multilayers graphene, HNO3 molecules can dope
between the graphene layers, so the doping efficiency is high. In
addition, to further clarify the EMS mechanisms, the coefficients
of absorption A, reflection R, and
transmission T were investigated. Considerable efforts
have been devoted to investigating these factors by Wen et al.41 and Cao et al.,42 who have proposed the corresponding relationships to obtain these
factors from the measured S-parameters (dB) in previous
studies. In their work, the scattering parameters, including S11 and S21, were
determined by a vector network analyzer both using the wave-guide
method. In this work, the S-parameters of the samples
between 8.2 and 12.4 GHz were measured through the coaxial method
by a PNA-X network vector analyzer. Hence, we calculated the reflection
efficient R, absorption coefficient A, and transmission coefficient T using an alternative
method proposed in Yang et al. and Khanum et al.’s papers,
where the same coaxial method was employed.43,44 The related equations are described as follows 6   7   8   9   10   11  

Figure 9 (a) EMSE of
PET/graphene-2 doped by HNO3 with different
concentrations and (b) EMSE of PET/graphene-2 doped by HNO3 for different time.

Subsequently, the effect of HNO3 doping on the
SEA and SER parameters of graphene stacks is
shown
in Figure 7d–f.
After doping, both SEA and SER values of all
of the PET/graphene-N increase, which is attributed
to the improved conductivity. The results are in accordance with eqs 3 and 4, indicating that chemical doping using HNO3 (as a P-type
dopant) is one of the effective ways to improve the conductivity and
EMSE of CVD graphene.

The removal of PMMA can damage the integrity
and the EMSE of graphene.
In particular, the more the number of transferred graphene layers
with removing PMMA, the more serious is the damage to graphene. However,
HNO3 doping can increase the EMSE of these damaged graphene
stacks PET/graphene-3 by 4.5 times. Therefore, the effect of HNO3 doping on the improvement of the EMSE of graphene is expected
to be more obvious with improving the integrity of graphene in the
process of removing PMMA. The thickness of 1–3-layer graphene
EMS active layer varies from 3.4 to 10.2 Å, which is only about
1/1000 of the thickness of the conventional EMS active layer.45 Therefore, the HNO3 doping graphene
can be used to prepare ultrathin electronic devices and transparent
EMS window.

Figure 9a shows
the EMSE of PET/graphene-2 doped by 15, 35, 55, 65, and 95% HNO3 for 30 min. The EMSE did not have a significant improvement
after doping by 15% HNO3 (Figure 9a). The EMS performance increased with the
HNO3 concentration. With increasing the HNO3 concentration, more and more HNO3 molecules react with
graphene, thus resulting in the increase of the carrier concentration.
The EMSE of PET/graphene-2 reaches the maximum value for 55% HNO3 doping, and it declines for the higher HNO3 concentration
(65 or 95%). This might be attributed to the fact that the high HNO3 concentration may induce defects on graphene40 and the deformation of PET film, thus affecting the shielding
performance of graphene.

The effect of doping time on the EMS
performance of graphene was
studied and shown in Figure 9b. For all samples in this section, the concentration of HNO3 was fixed at 55%. PET/graphene-2 was doped for 5 min, 30
min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h. The EMSE of PET/graphene-2 has been significantly
improved after doping for only 5 min, demonstrating the high doping
efficiency of HNO3. The EMSE of graphene increased with
the doping time, and it changes very little after 3 h of doping.

Figure 10 shows
the transmittances of PET/graphene-N (N = 1, 2, and 3) before and after doping. All graphene stacks on PET
films have a high transmittance at 400–1100 nm. It is found
that the HNO3 doping almost has no effect on the transmittance
of graphene. For PET/graphene-2, the transmittance even increases
slightly after HNO3 doping. The residuals between graphene
layer may be rinsed by HNO3, thus resulting in the increase
of the graphene transmittance.

after doping by HNO3: (a) PET/graphene-1, (b) PET/graphene-2,
and (c) PET/graphene-3.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have used HNO3 as a P-type dopant to
improve the EMS performance of CVD graphene. It has been found that
the HNO3 doping increases the EMSE of PET/graphene-3 by
a factor of 4.5, which indicates that HNO3 doping is an
effective way to improve the EMSE of graphene. The effect of HNO3 doping on the improvement of the EMSE of graphene is expected
to be more obvious with improving the integrity of graphene in the
process of removing PMMA and transferring graphene. Besides, graphene
by HNO3 doping has high transmittance by rinsing the residuals
between graphene layers. The thickness of graphene EMS active layer
is only about 1/1000 of the thickness of the conventional one. HNO3-doping CVD graphene has wide potential applications in ultrathin
electronic devices and transparent EMS window.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Graphene (ratio of monolayer
≥95%) grown by the CVD method on copper foil was purchased
from 2D Carbon Tech Inc. Ltd (Changzhou). FeCl3·6H2O, acetone (analytical reagent), HNO3 (analytical
reagent), anisole (analytical reagent), and HCl (analytical reagent)
were obtained from Kelong Inc. Ltd (Chengdu). PET films and PMMA with
a molecular weight of 9000 were purchased from 2D Carbon Tech Inc.
Ltd (Changzhou). The Cu etchant was 15 wt % FeCl3 aqueous
solution.

4.2 Characterization
The EMSE of the
samples between 8.2 and 12.4 GHz is tested through the coaxial method
by a PNA-X network vector analyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc.). The
samples for the test were 13 mm in diameter. To avoid the EM waves
generated by the port spill test error, both ends of the port were
calibrated before testing. The transmittances of graphene were tested
by UV-3600 UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation,
Japan). To avoid the influence of the substrate on the light transmittance
of graphene, graphene was first transferred to a transparent substrate
(PET), and a blank substrate (PET) was used as a reference. Raman
spectrum was tested by a Raman spectrometer (DXRxi, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, United States) imaging microscope using a 532 nm excitation
laser source. To avoid damage to the graphene by the laser source,
laser energy is set to 4.5 mW. Each sample was tested in three areas.
Optical microscope: first, the graphene was transferred onto PET films.
Then, the CMM-20 metallographic optical microscopes (Shanghai Changfang
Optical Instrument Co., Ltd.) was used to characterize the graphene
transferred onto the PET films by analyzing the color contrast between
graphene and silicon wafers.

4.3 Transfer and Doping Process
PMMA
has many prominent features, such as the relatively low viscosity,
excellent wetting capability, flexibility, and good dissolubility
in several organic solvents. Moreover, the high transparency of PMMA
makes it clear to observe the process of Cu removal. Therefore, PMMA
was used as the supporting layer to transfer graphene grown by CVD.
PMMA anisole solution (50 mg/mL) was spin-coated on graphene by a
spin-coating apparatus at room temperature; then, the samples were
cured at room temperature for 3 h. CVD graphene was grown on both
sides of the copper substrate. To facilitate the etching of the copper
substrate and maintain the quality of transferred graphene, the graphene
on one side of the copper substrate was removed by oxygen plasma at
50 W for 1 min. The metal substrate was etched with a 15 wt % aqueous
solution of ferric chloride for 2 h until the metal substrate was
completely etched away. Then, the PMMA/graphene stack was transferred
to a Petri dish containing clean deionized water and washed-off the
remaining etchant for 10 min. The cleaned PMMA/graphene stack was
transferred to a Petri dish containing 10% HCl to wash off the residual
metal ions for 20 min. Next, the PMMA/graphene stack was transferred
to a Petri dish containing clean deionized water to wash off the residual
HCl for 10 min. PET film, glass, and silicon wafers were cleaned using
ultrasound for 5 min in acetone and isopropyl alcohol to remove the
remains on its surface. The PMMA/graphene stacks were picked from
the water with the prepared PET film (or glass or silicon wafers)
and were dried at room temperature for 12 h. PMMA was removed with
acetone for 3 h; then, the graphene was transferred onto the PET film
(or glass, SiO2/Si wafers), as shown in Figure 1. Multilayer graphene was transferred
by stacking the transfer of monolayer graphene. Graphene was doped
by immersing the samples into HNO3 aqueous solution at
room temperature with various concentrations and reaction times.
