Shape
memory polymers (SMPs) are an exciting class of stimuli-responsive
smart materials that demonstrate reactive and reversible changes in
mechanical property, usually by switching between different states
due to external stimuli. We report on the development of a polyurethane-based
SMP foam for effective pressure redistribution that demonstrates controllable
changes in dynamic pressure redistribution capability at a low transition
temperature (∼24 °C)—ideally suited to matching
modulations in body contact pressure for dynamic pressure relief (e.g.,
for alleviation or pressure ulcer effects). The resultant SMP material
has been extensively characterized by a series of tests including
stress–strain testing, compression testing, dynamic mechanical
analysis, optical microscopy, UV–visible absorbance spectroscopy,
variable-temperature areal pressure distribution, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential
scanning calorimetry, dynamic thermogravimetric analysis, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The foam system
exhibits high responsivity when tested for plantar pressure modulation
with significant potential in pressure ulcers treatment. Efficient
pressure redistribution (∼80% reduction in interface pressure),
high stress response (∼30% applied stress is stored in fixity
and released on recovery), and excellent deformation recovery (∼100%)
are demonstrated in addition to significant cycling ability without
performance loss. By providing highly effective pressure redistribution
and modulation when in contact with the body’s surface, this
SMP foam offers novel mechanisms for alleviating the risk of pressure
ulcers.

1 Introduction
Shape
memory polymers (SMPs) can temporarily and securely hold a deformed
shape but recover to an original, “true” shape, in response
to an external stimulus such as temperature, pH, etc.1−8 This unique “shape memory effect” comprises shape
fixity and shape recovery (Figure 1). Shape fixity enables acquisition of a temporary,
deformed shape via a suitable programming process, whereas shape recovery
retrieves the original shape via controlled application of a stimulus.9−12 This shape controllability (i.e., fixity or recovery) is currently
at the forefront of multiple research domains spanning biomedical,13−17 textiles,18−20 aerospace,21,22 etc. Primarily in biomedical,
SMP are attractive in critical applications including sutures,23 stents,24 embolic
biomedical devices,25 drug delivery devices,26,27 tissue scaffolds,28,29 and compression stockings.30−33 To further extend understanding of such materials, this study will
systematically characterize the use of porous, open-cell SMP foams
as smart contact surfaces for controlled, dynamic pressure (re)distribution
on the human body.

Figure 1 Diagram of the volume changes expected in shape fixity
and recovery processes of shape memory polymers, below or above the
polymer glass-transition temperature, Tg, upon application and/or removal of an external pressure constraint.

Pressure ulcers/injuries arise when uncontrolled,
uneven, and prolonged pressure distribution between the body and support
surface generates localized regions of high pressure.34 High pressure damages soft tissue, especially near bony
prominences due to their low curvature, and significantly compresses
vascular networks, decreasing the supply of oxygen and essential nutrients,
resulting in tissue ischemia and, finally, tissue breakdown. The resultant
chronic ulcers may cause significant pain, discomfort, decreased quality
of life, and, when associated with superimposed infection, may even
lead to death.35,36 Despite several available, yet
oft-ineffective ulcer treatment measures, the first, most basic preventive
and recommended action is to reduce the interfacial pressure between
the skin and support surface.

Pressure distribution is the dispersion
of localized peak pressure or shear forces over larger areas. Usually,
it is carried out by either; (i) a reactive surface (e.g., foam or
gel mattresses) where pressure reduction occurs through increased
contact area, or (ii) an active surface that repositions body weight
by periodically shifting the contact area via alternate inflation
and deflation of a series of air-filled bladders. Both have questionable
efficacy, and many challenges still exist in current medical practice:(A) Contemporary foam-based
reactive surfaces primarily exhibit passive pressure reduction; they
have fixed immersion (extent of allowing the body to sink into the
surface) and envelopment (ability to conform to bodily contours, especially
around anatomical landmarks, e.g., heel, sacrum, coccyx, etc.).37−41 Thus, it is virtually impossible for such modalities to achieve
adjustable pressure distribution, if required.

(B) Currently available dynamic air mattresses
fail miserably in envelopment. They are also costly, complicated in
design, and noisy in use.

(C) No currently available surface can combine both active and reactive
functions, for selective response to patient needs.

(D) Although manual repositioning of patients
aids pressure relief, it is tedious and labor-intensive, placing unduly
heavy burdens on medical care providers.



SMP foams are the focus of this paper due to their low density, high
compressibility, flexibility, softness, and wearer comfort, potentially
ideal as a cushioning, contouring, responsive, and material that can
be easily processed. Open-celled structures potentially offer greater
comfort due to their higher air and moisture permeabilities compared
to closed-cell structures (e.g., syntactic foams).42−46 The unique stimulus-responsive and dynamic shape-change
properties of SMP could solve some of the pressure redistribution
challenges.47−50 The nature of the foam material (i.e., the firmness or softness)
tends to determine the pressure generated on the body’s surface.51,52 Current commercial cushioning materials (e.g., sleeping mattresses,
shoe insoles, car seats, etc.) have a fixed stiffness, meaning they
are completely unsuited for externally responsive pressure modulation.
Conversely, SMP demonstrates a notable modulus change in response
to a variable external stimulus, typically heat.53,54 Such changes are superior to conventional polymers in their mechanical
and thermodynamical properties around the (glass) transition temperature
(Tg here, ∼24 °C) tuned around
the SMP normal working temperature (here, ∼20 °C). Thus,
above Tg, the SMP behaves rubbery, elastic,
and soft; below Tg, it becomes hard and
displays glassy behavior. Such reversible firmness change properties
are ideal for matching to body temperature fluctuations.54 Additionally, SMP shape fixity properties can
be further exploited to reshape the selecting part of a foam substrate
for maximal immersion and envelopment.

This paper will explore
the use of SMP foams as reactive and smart surfaces for pressure distribution,
using insoles and foot pressure redistribution as an illustrative
application. Plantar pressure redistribution is important because
localized and prolonged plantar pressure leads to chronic pressure
sores, nonhealing wounds, and ultimately results in foot ulceration,
with further potential limb loss in high-risk groups, e.g., diabetic
patients, sufferers of muscular dystrophy, and the elderly.55−58 Lightweight and flexible orthotic foams can reduce fatigue, relieve
pressure, and increase circulation by evenly redistributing normal
and shear stresses arising from bodily weight along the length and
breadth of the foot, for personalized comfort and support.59 Broadly, two possible methods exist for utilizing
SMP foam shape fixation for pressure redistribution: (i) Shaped fixing,
where a predetermined shape is achieved prior to foot application;
the coverage area is increased to reduce pressure. There is no temperature
fluctuation for pressure relief and foam Tg > 50 °C so there is little shape change if the foot temperature
increases; (ii) Redistribution of pressure points, where the fixed
shape is used but temperature fluctuation is done externally in the
foot to selectively release the contact stress or pressure. This shifts
pressure points naturally, preventing excessive stress during plantar
loading, especially over sensitive areas (e.g., bony prominences),59 and the actuation range of the foam will be
lower (∼30–50 °C). This paper will systematically
characterize thermally actuated SMP foams as used for dynamic plantar
pressure redistributive applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Shape Memory Polyurethane
(SMPu) Polymer Foam Synthesis
Shape memory polyurethane (SMPu)
foam was synthesized using the gas foaming technique where a chemical
blowing agent (i.e., water) reacts with isocyanate monomers to produce
carbon dioxide (Figure 2a).60,61 The novelty of this synthetic work is that
this poly(propylene glycol) (PPG)–poly(ethylene glycol) system
for different methods for pressure control has not been explored previously.
After foaming, the open-cell SMPu samples were cured for a further
24 h in air at 80 °C. Such samples were subsequently characterized
and tested without further treatment, against a thermoplastic polyurethane
(TPU) reference material. Figure 2b shows the SMPu foam structure where released CO2 gas promoted self-assembly of a porous architecture with
good interconnectivity.9 The SMPu foam
density was 64.7 kg m–3, with a porosity of 94%
and pore size range of 0.1–0.5 mm.

2.2 Shape
Memory Polyurethane Polymer Foam Bonding Interactions and Materials
Characterization
All expected thermoplastic polyurethane
signals were observed in the attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Additional assignments (see Figure S3, Supporting Information (SI)) indicate
clear differences between the TPU and SMPu foam concerning incidence
and intensity of IR bands, due to the partial degradation of TPU as
well as the organic reactants used to form the SMPu foam.62−64 The shift of certain bands (N–H, C=O, and C–O
stretches of TPU are shifted to lower wavenumbers for SMPu foam) indicates
increased hydrogen bonding effects in the hard segments.65,66 Such differences are caused by the changes made to the parent TPU
structure upon mixing with MDI and other components, during the SMPu
foam formation process. These structural changes cause modifications
of, e.g., modulus, stiffness, etc., and thus facilitate the reversible
shape memory properties. For example, there are a greater number of
signals for −CH stretches and bends as well as shifted and
changed band profiles at 1729 cm–1, representing
hydrogen-bonded carbonyl stretching components (−C=O)
of the urethane ester groups and corroborated by the C–O–C
moiety at 869 cm–1, for the SMPu foams. Likewise,
a smaller shoulder at 3450 cm–1, present in the
bands for the SMPu foams but absent in the parent TPU, is consistent
with non-hydrogen-bonded urea and urethane N–H groups, possibly
from the amine catalysts.

There is broad Raman band position
agreement between TPU and SMPu foam (see Figure S4, SI). Data were acquired both above and below the Tg; data below the Tg for the SMPu foam were acquired while the sample has a constrained,
temporarily fixed shape, to ensure the sub-Tg condition. While structural disorder revealed by a shift
in temperature around the Tg is expected,
only moderate changes in detected bonding interactions were observed
here.63,67−70 The SMPu foam shows increased
relative intensity for the H-bonded urethane stretch (1706 cm–1), believed to be due to the disordered hard segments
of poly(urethane urea) dispersed in the soft-segment phase.71 In addition to increased band intensities, there
are several shifted or absent bands for the SMPu foams versus the
TPU reference. Both 977 and 865 cm–1 (both C–O–C)
bands are absent, while the 1439 cm–1 (C–H)
and 1048 cm–1 (C–O) bands are shifted, for
the foam. This indicates the additional formation of chemical interactions
thought to be induced by the presence of oxygen functional groups
and/or additional disorder-related defects. Finally, the SMPu foam
shows further weak band(s) at <300 cm–1; in the
235–295 cm–1 region, which is completely
absent for the TPU and likely corresponds to aliphatic chains, possibly
arising from the use of linkers or blowing agents in the formation
of the SMPu foams. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) confirms that the broader SMPu foam chemical structure is
heavily dependent on the precursor mixture components and ratios used
(see Figure S5 and refer to Table 1). Signals at 7.074 and 7.248 ppm conform
to the Ha and Hb of the MDI precursor aromatic
ring; the presence of PPG precursor indicated by shifts at 4.992 ppm
(CH group) and 1.571–1.119 ppm (signals of CH3 protons
at slightly different chemical environment); and the signals at 3.5–3.2
ppm from the CH2 protons of the EG precursor.72,73

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves (second
heating) of the SMPu foam, (see Figure S6, SI), probing the crystallinity show no significant inflection point,
peak, or step change in the DSC curves of either the as-synthesized
SMPu foam or TPU (reference standard), over −80 to 100 °C
that would otherwise indicate a kinetic change at the Tg.74,75 This is a known problem for medical-grade
urethanes and other highly cross-linked materials, where the Tg often becomes flat and diffuse such that it
cannot be seen in DSC.76 Dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA) data are more sensitive than DSC (up to 100 times)
to changes occurring at the Tg (see Figure 3), and this corresponds
to what is observed here.76,77 This signifies that
both the SMPu foam and TPU are extensively amorphous and display typically
glassy behavior over the temperature range, perhaps explained by the
high miscibility of hard and soft phases, smaller more imperfectly
packed hard domains, and ready chain mobility.75,78−82 This amorphous character is further affirmed by the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) data (see Figure S7, SI); the diffraction
patterns comprise only a broad amorphous peak at 2θ = 20–22°
over the entire acquisition range. This amorphous behavior is as expected
for segmented Tg-type TPU-based materials.83

on SMPu foams indicating the elastic modulus and tan δ
responses respectively in response to a controlled variation in temperature.

temperatures.

Dynamic thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) curves illustrate the thermal stabilities of TPU and SMPu foams
under both inert (i.e., N2) and oxidizing (i.e., air) conditions
while their first derivatives highlight degradation weight loss maxima
over the 35–600 °C range (see Figure S8 and Table S1, SI). Broadly, SMPu foams
exhibit simple thermal decomposition with the formation of gaseous
byproducts, whereas TPU undergoes multistep decomposition. Initial
weight losses (≤2%) are due to loss of adsorbed moisture and
the thermolysis processes disrupting the weakest structural bonds,
a well-known trait of TPU-based samples. The slightly higher SMPu
foam weight loss is likely due to the greater adsorbed moisture on
the foam’s larger surface area as well as evaporation of components
such as CO2 and long-chain alkyl fragments from the foaming
agents. The SMPu foam presents primarily a single degradation stage,
whereas the pure TPU demonstrates a two-/three-stage decomposition
process, in line with previous reports.84−86 For TPU, the first decomposition
stage relates to scission of the principal urethane linkages, corresponding
to degradation of TPU hard segments; the second decomposition stage
likely relates to degradation of the soft phase.87−89 SMPu foams
have a slightly earlier decomposition temperature onset in weight
loss; the foams are less structurally thermostable due to decomposition
of the present TPU parent material during foam formation as well as
the decreased distinction between hard and soft segments.90 In air, a final degradation step is found for
both the SMPu foam and TPU at ca. 540–575 °C, believed
to correspond to C–C and C–O bonds on the main polyurethane
chain and the char formed in the previous stages. No further hydrolysis
steps were observed here at elevated temperatures.91 The final char residual weight was higher for TPU, due
to part degradation of the SMPu foam during production of the initial
foam.

2.3 Shape Memory Polyurethane Polymer Foam Polymer
Properties Testing
The temperature-dependent mechanical properties
of the SMPu polymer foam, including modulus and tan δ
(efficiency of energy loss due to molecular disentanglement and rearrangements),
are reported in Figure 3a. A sharp decline in elastic modulus occurs over −5 to 25
°C, in conjunction with a prominent peak in the tan δ spectrum,
where the maximum indicates the glass-transition temperature; Tmax ≡ Tg ∼
24 °C. The tan δ−Tg for SMPu composites is higher than that of its TPU counterpart (<0
°C); hence, unmodified TPU would be unsuitable for any kind of
bodily responsive pressure redistributive scenario in reality, which
is attributed to the increased free volume between polymeric chains
and their greater mobility, in the foam structure.92−95 Above the Tg, the material exhibits properties reflective of the rubbery
state, indicating the transition of soft segments in the SMP network.
tan δ is linked to a material’s energy dissipating
quality;96 the low values in the rubbery
state and high strain recovery rates observed for SMPu indicate close
to ideal spring behavior.97 These results
were similar to thermomechanical compression tests conducted on the
Instron tensile/compression tester, where a high compressive modulus
is observed at low temperature (<10 °C), corresponding to
a low force requirement, while a low modulus is found at a higher
temperature (>20 °C)—0.01078 MPa (i.e., ≈10
kPa) (Figure 3b), which
is still significant but orders of magnitude (102–103) lower than reported values for TPU standards (depending
on elastomer composition) at room temperature in dry environments.93,98,99

For cushioning and pressure
distribution applications, foam density and compression firmness (i.e.,
resistance to deformation) are the most important parameters. Foam
firmness directly influences internal pressure development, and even
slight changes in firmness can cause varying interactions with contacting
tissue and so generate different interfacial pressures. Furthermore,
foam firmness or softness is important in product design, especially
for optimum pressure performance for postural control and wearer satisfaction.
For example, although soft cushions (low firmness) decrease excessive
compressive forces on joints, reducing ulcer risk, the excessive softness
also reduces mechanical support, causing poor postural stability.
Conversely, a firmer foam, with high rigidity, generates sufficient
reactive forces to maintain postural stability, especially for older
adults. Conventional foams, including ordinary polyurethane, do not
exhibit heat-stimulated firmness modulation across a normal working
temperature range, making them completely unsuited to any intended
dynamic response application. Commercial products can only be altered
at the production stage by modifying the chemical formulations and
processing technologies. Conversely, the SMPu foam presented here
as proof of concept can respond quickly and reversibly to allow a
significant change in firmness over a narrow temperature range (i.e.,
in response to ambient heat stimuli).100,101 The transition
range of SMP can be readily tuned further to work across different
temperature domains. In terms of relevance to orthotics, the SMPu
reported here will be in the viscoelastic rubbery state for the projected
duration and conditions of operation, exhibiting a springy, puttylike
behavior that is ideal for pressure relief and support. The extended
presence of the rubbery state thought to be aided by the use and presence
of cross-linkers in the polymer system, extends the rubbery plateau
and delays transition to viscous and fluid states.102

Figure 4a shows the influence of temperature on SMPu foam firmness, expressed
in compression force deflection (CFD; the pressure (lb in.–2) needed to compress to 25% of the specimen height). A sharp increase
(up to 200%) in CFD is noted when the temperature is varied within
the SMPu transition range,30 lowering from
25 to 10 °C. Lower CFD values indicate a softer foam of smaller
compression modulus, while higher CFD numbers stage firmer response
with high modulus. A soft SMPu foam deforms easily, providing more
interfacial contact area (i.e., higher immersion) to cover body contours
for pressure reduction (i.e., higher envelopment).

of the SMPu foam against temperature. (b) Tekscan F-scan pressure system for dynamic, variable temperature, areal pressure

downward force from the heel of an adult male. (c) Areal pressure
distribution of the SMPu foams under different surface temperatures,

This firmness variability was further validated using a Tekscan F-scan
foot pressure measuring system to examine the pressure distribution
of the SMPu foam by altering the temperature (Figure 4b,c). At lower temperature (≤5 °C),
the SMPu foam is rigid with a high elastic modulus, due to which more
pressure peaks (in red) are obtained over a concentrated region. At
higher temperature (≥25 °C), the SMPu foam softens with
a low modulus; a near-6-fold difference in firmness over the 5–25
°C range. Thus, the pressure is effectively redistributed and
lower-pressure peaks become apparent. As such, this temperature range
of operation is ideally suited for when the SMPu foam is in direct
contact with anatomical extremities, which are able to experience
temperature fluctuations spanning this range.

Apart from a reversible
firmness change, the SMPu foam also allows unique shape fixing and
recovery properties. Through simple programming steps, the required
shape can be temporarily fixed by deforming the sample at high temperature
(T > Tg) to the target
and then cooling it down to low temperature (T < Tg) under specific external constraints. Different
shapes/concavities (A–D) were reversibly fixed from the original
foam specimen under such temperature variation conditions (Figure 5a).

Figure 5 (a) Various programmed
temporary shapes (A–D) from an SMPu foam (original) upon application
of an external constraint at T > Tg and then cooling the constrained shape down to T < Tg to “fix”
the desired temporary shape. (b) Pressure distribution of the programmed
shapes (P–R) with varying surface troughs indicating variations
in interfacial contact area with the spherical indenter. (Photograph

The pressure interaction depends on both immersion (ability to sink
into the surface) and envelopment (ability to conform to the body
contour) of the surface in contact. Some anatomical landmarks (e.g.,
heel, sacrum, coccyx, etc.) have a complex contour and are always
at high risk of pressure peaks due to either poor immersion or envelopment
at the contact surfaces. However, with the unique shape fixing ability
of the SMPu foam, the anatomical shapes and selective contours can
be readily generated directly at the site of interaction to provide
greater contact area for pressure reduction and support. This pressure
reduction ability was further validated to check the pressure interaction
of different programmed shapes (P–R; Figure 5b). For the foam specimens fixed to different
levels of spherical concavities, a higher trough from the surface
(shape R) results in a larger contact with the spherical indenter
and produces lower pressure compared to a shallower trough (shape
P). Thus, there is an almost 80% reduction in interfacial pressure
going from shape P to R.

Figure 6a shows the recovery of the original SMPu foam from
a compressed state upon exposure to a heat stimulus. Once recovered,
the foam can be reprogrammed to a new shape, without any residual
memory effects. The whole cycle of shape fixing and recovery can be
repeated multiple times, without adverse effects (Figure 6b,c).103 The shape fixity (the ratio of the remained deformation and the
maximum deformation applied) is ∼88%, and full recovery (i.e.,
100% from the fixed shape to its original shape) can be observed without
any loss in performance. When measured under a given constraint, i.e.,
a given sustained strain, the amount of recovery stress generated
in the sample is indicated in Figure 6d. Almost 30% of the applied stress is stored during
shape fixing, which is then released in the recovery process.

3 Conclusions
Highly responsive, shape memory
polyurethane (SMPu) foams have been synthesized using a simple gas
foaming technique. Biomechanical testing of the resilient, moderately
deformable SMPu foams exhibits efficient pressure redistribution (∼80%
reduction of interfacial pressure), stress response (∼30% applied
stress stored in fixity), shape recovery properties (∼100%
recovery), extended rubbery plateau, and high cycling stability to
compression, of this well-investigated system, among the most impressive
reported to date.104

While we have
demonstrated highly responsive temperature actuation across the SMPu
foam material on a macro scale, localized selectivity of temperature
actuation across a surface must still be achieved for enhanced patient
responsivity and improved outcomes. Furthermore, refinements and improved
control over the gas foaming synthetic method are also needed to achieve
and ensure a higher transition temperature, through variation of reaction
mixture ratios and components. In addition, PU-based structures, including
foams, are known to be flammable—to differing degrees depending
on PU source and mixture composition (i.e., polymer chain composition,
polymer density, etc). These properties can be mitigated through inclusion
of flame retardants active in the condensed phase, e.g., halogenated
flame retardants, inorganic fillers, carbon compounds, etc., to confer
heat resistance, suppress smoke, and minimize flashover effects.105−108 Such improvements will be the focus of future research studies.

Using the illustrative example of plantar pressure redistribution,
the SMPu foam showed effective capabilities in dissipating localized
pressure buildup arising from weight-bearing stress forces acting
on the feet, knees, hips, and back, with progressive deformation occurring
in response to increasing load, especially over/beneath bony prominences,
to adjacent tissue so as to provide support and relief from discomfort,
ulcers, hot spots, etc.109 Thus, this nontoxic,
low-temperature-responsive SMPu foam can facilitate preprogrammed
modulation of the interface firmness and pressure to support related
ergonomics, promote medical intervention, and aid wearer comfort.
These findings, based on extensive characterization of the SMPu foam
will be of direct relevance to diabetics, the elderly, treating bedsore
ailments, sufferers of muscular dystrophy, and many other at-risk
groups, while the broader principles will appeal to any involved in
the smart materials and functional polymers field.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals and Shape Memory
Polyurethane Polymer Foam Synthesis
Details of the synthesis
process for shape memory polyurethane (SMPu) foam are given in Table 1, which lists the
chemical components used in foam production. The SMPu foam was produced
via a prepolymer process from 4,4′-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate
(MDI; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company), poly(propylene glycol) (PPG, Mn: 725; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company), and
ethylene glycol (EG; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company). The MDI and
PPG were reacted in a specific molar ratio for 2 h at 80 °C to
give the prepolymer. Then, the chain extender (EG) was added together
with the suitable amount of amine catalyst (A-1 and A-33; Shijiazhuang
Chuanghong Technology Co. Ltd., China), tin catalyst (T-9; Air Product),
and surfactant (Dabco DC5179; Air Product). Diols (e.g., 1,4-butane
diol or ethylene glycol) or diamines have frequently been used as
cross-linkers in making shape memory polyurethane for decades.110,111 Hydroxyl functional cross-linkers such as EG usually also serve
as chain extenders, although in cases where water is present simultaneously,
there are competitive effects; regardless, the hydroxyl groups of
both routes will favor urethane linkage formation.88,112,113 Deionized water (resistivity,
18 MΩ cm) was used as the chemical blowing agent for gas foaming.
Mixing time was 10 s, and observed cream time was 40 s. After foaming,
the sample was cured for 24 h at 80 °C.

4.1.1 Shape Memory Polyurethane Polymer Foam Material
Characterization
For thermomechanical characterization, the
compression tests were conducted on an Instron tester attached to
a heating chamber. The compression stress, strain, and modulus were
examined at a different temperature range (5–50 °C). The
foam firmness was also obtained in compression force deflection (CFD),
defined as the pressure (lb in.–2) needed to compress
a foam specimen by a specified percentage of its original thickness.
Herein, the CFD at 25% compression was recorded at different temperatures.

Foam density was determined using standard protocols (ASTM D 1622)
by cutting foam with specific dimensions and measuring its weight.
Pore dimensions and distribution were examined by Leica optical microscopy
(model: M165C; ASTM D 3576). The polymer thermal transition, cycling,
and degradation were mapped using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
in triplicate and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) cycling
tests. TGA measurements were carried out on a Mettler-Toledo Star
e TGA Thermogravimetric Analyzer, under both air (50 mL min–1) and N2 (50 mL min–1) conditions in
dynamic mode, at a 10 °C min–1 ramp rate, over
the 35–600 °C range. DSC was done on a PerkinElmer DSC
8000 under N2 (50 mL min–1) flow, over
the −80 to 100 °C range, at a ramp rate of 10 °C
min–1 and kept under hold conditions for 1 min at
−50 °C. This scanning process was repeated up to three
cycles, and the result of the second scan was used to obtain a transition
endothermic peak. The first scan was performed to remove the residual
solvent unconverted monomer. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
was conducted on a PerkinElmer DMA tester to ascertain the variation
in the modulus (glassy/rubbery) with temperature. Furthermore, wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was also employed to check the crystallinity
in the synthesized SMPu foam along with an ordinary thermoplastic
polyurethane (TPU) as a reference. The WAXD profile was collected
using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.542 Å), operating at 60 kV and 60 mA, over the 2θ
range of 10–40°.

Raman spectroscopy was carried
out on a BaySpec Nomadic Raman Microscope, using a 785 nm laser excitation
source, over the 200–3200 cm–1 range. All
solid samples were analyzed at both ambient temperature and low temperature
(T < Tg), by placement
on a surface filled with a NH4Cl–ice water mixture.
To confirm conversion below the Tg for
the low-temperature reading and to ensure its state for the entirety
of the acquisition period, the foam was fixed in a folded, constrained
shape. Thermal equilibrium was ensured in all of the cases by maintaining
the specimen under constant corresponding temperature for 5 min. Outputs
are given relative to a 10 s integration time and 100% laser intensity.
The band position and band intensity of the characteristic absorption
peaks of the specimen were calculated by a Lorentzian curve-fitting
procedure.114 At least five positions on
each sample were scanned at each temperature, with near-identical
profiles. Attenuated total reflectance FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy
was carried out on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100. Measurements were done
over the 4000–650 cm–1 range, at a resolution
of 4 cm–1, with 20 scans per sample reading. Both
TPU and SMPu solid samples were analyzed under ambient conditions.
Results were ATR-corrected and baseline-subtracted using the onboard
PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 software.

Chemical compositions of
the final SMPu foam product were determined by liquid proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. Samples were
analyzed on a Jeol ECZ 500 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 495.13
MHz equipped with a double-resonance 5 mm Royal probe at 298 K. A
total of 16–128 free induction decays (FIDs) were collected
into 16 K data points with a spectral width of 9615.38 Hz (16 ppm).
A 2 s relaxation delay is used between pulses. Spectra were analyzed
in Delta (Jeol Ltd.). FIDs were zero-filled to 32 K, and an exponential
line-broadening function of 0.2 Hz was applied to the FID prior to
Fourier transformation. All of the sample spectra were phased and
manually baseline-corrected, and spectra were referenced to trimethylsilane
internal standard.

4.1.2 Shape Memory Property
Testing
The fixity of the SMPu foam to different shapes and
the shape recovery process were performed under both load-free and
constrained (loaded) conditions. To fix a new shape, e.g., a shorter
size, a cylindrical foam specimen was compressed at a “high”
temperature (T > Tg; ∼40 °C) to a corresponding strain (εu) on the Instron Compression tester. Then, the compressed
foam was cooled down to well below the transition temperature (T < Tg; ∼0 °C),
and the foam was isothermally unloaded to zero stress level, to check
the fixed strain level (εm). For the original shape
recovery, the fixed foam was heated at high temperature (T > Tg), and both time and strain were
recorded to examine the recovery process under a load-free state.
This cycle of thermomechanical fixity and recovery was repeated five
consecutive times to confirm repeatability. In addition to load-free
shape recovery, constrained recovery testing was also conducted to
obtain the amount of the recovery stress stored in the foam after
fixity. The recovery stresses at different fixed strains (εm) were also measured. In addition to the use of Instron compression
plates for deformation, other objects with spherical or sharp shapes
were also used for memory testing to yield complex concavities of
different shapes at selective foam sites.

4.1.3 Pressure
(Re)Distribution Measurement
Two simple laboratory methods
were employed for measurement of pressure distribution at the interfacial
contact between the foam and the indenter. The first method used a
spherical object indenting the foam under isothermal conditions (Figure 7), and the amount
of contact area and the depth of penetration (from the top surface)
marked between them were obtained.37 Using
the immersion data, the pressure was calculated from the ratio of
the object mass and the interfacial area of contact. The SMPu foam
can be easily programmed (fixed) to different shapes, as explained
in Section 2.3; varying
concavity levels were fixed on the foam surface, and the interfacial
pressure with the spherical object was analyzed.

Figure 7 (a) Schematic of the
response of the shape memory polymer foam upon application of an object
mass of known shape and weight reflecting the contact area, used in
the pressure test. (b) Image of Tekscan F-scan pressure
measurement system setup used for pressure distribution measurement.

The second method of studying the interfacial contact
includes an active measurement of the interfacial pressure distributions
at different temperatures. The Tekscan F-scan foot
pressure measurement system was used, consisting of several pressure
points arranged on a flat film surface (Figure S1). First, the F-scan foot system was calibrated by an individual male
volunteer after performing several initial trails under “walking
calibration”. After calibration, the SMPu foam was placed over
the pressure sensor and the individual stood still and stationary
on the foam surface. The pressure data were transmitted in real time
to a computer via a WiFi channel. The pressure distributions on the
foam surface heated to different temperatures were recorded. Due to
limited foam size available for the experiment, only the area of the
plantar fasciitis (i.e., underneath the heel) was used in the analysis.
