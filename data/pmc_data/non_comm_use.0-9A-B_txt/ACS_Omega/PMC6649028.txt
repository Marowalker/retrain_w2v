Synthesis
of a new HKUST-1 composite based on single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs) was successfully achieved (SWCNT@HKUST-1). SWCNTs
were used as templates to grow rod-like HKUST-1 crystals over the
surface of the nanotubes. N2 adsorption properties showed
an increment on the surface area and pore volume for the SWCNT@HKUST-1
composite. Furthermore, the CO2 capture increased, from
7.92 to 8.75 mmol g–1 at 196 K up to 100 kPa, for
the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite. This enhancement was directly associated
with the increase of the surface area of the composite. Additionally,
an increase in the CO2 heat of adsorption was estimated,
from 30 to 39.1 kJ mol–1 for the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite.
In situ Raman experiments corroborated the favored CO2 adsorption
for the composite and provided an insight into the augmented hydrophobicity
of the SWCNT@HKUST-1. Ethanol adsorption isotherms corroborated an
increase in the hydrophobicity of the material upon the incorporation
of carbon nanotubes.

Introduction
One of the most studied
and cited metal–organic framework
(MOF) materials is, undoubtedly, HKUST-1 (HKUST = Hong Kong University
of Science and Technology). HKUST-1, [Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n (BTC =
benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate), was first reported in 1999, and it
is constructed by Cu2 paddlewheel clusters connected by
BTC3– ligands, forming a cF crystal structure with Fm3̅m symmetry.1 Its rigid porous open-framework exhibits bimodal pore size
distribution and under the suitable activation conditions, it is possible
to access the unsaturated metal sites [open metal sites (OMS)],2,3 as water molecules can be removed to leave free sites in capped-octahedral
Cu(II) metal ions. HKUST-1 has been demonstrated to be a promising
MOF material in a large number of applications4−6 because of its
high surface area and the accessibility to OMS. Among these, energy-related
applications (from energy storage to transformation) hold the most
studied and interesting research-field for HKUST-1.7 Indeed, it has been previously shown that access to the
free coordination Cu(II) metal centers has considerably enhanced the
gas adsorption properties of HKUST-1.8,9 For example,
by thoroughly integrating X-ray diffraction (XRD), extended X-ray
absorption fine structure, UV–vis, X-ray absorption near-edge
spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopies, Bordiga10 has demonstrated that by removing coordinated water molecules,
chemically bound to the Cu(II) sites, the oxidation state of copper
remained unaffected, the crystallinity of the material was maintained,
and the gas adsorption properties enhanced. Thus, when HKUST-1 is
activated to remove coordinated water molecules, a post-synthetic
modification of the MOF material is achieved.

Another interesting
strategy to enhance the adsorption properties
of HKUST-1 is via its functionalization (modification). For example,
the incorporation of different functional groups within the micropores
of HKUST-1 has demonstrated superior CO2 capture properties.11,12 Another example of functionalization is the fabrication of composites
(hybrid functionalized materials) using MOF materials and other crystalline
structures, such as graphene or multiwalled carbon nanotubes. These
examples have been previously reported, emphasizing on the adsorption
of methane, benzene, ethanol, and other molecules.13,14 In addition, the synthesis of composites based on carbon nanotubes
and MOFs have shown promising results in the field of gas storage
and in an ideal scenario, such composites would show an improved thermal
conductivity in comparison to the pure MOF system (generally poor
thermally conductive material). For example, Prasanth et al.15 reported the synthesis of SWCNTs incorporated
in MIL-101 to obtain a composite MOF material (SWNT@MIL-101), where
the structure of the MOF material was not disturbed by the incorporation
of SWCNTs. Hydrogen (H2) adsorption capacities of MIL-101
were observed to be increased from 6.37 to 9.18 wt % at 77 K and 60
bar, and from 0.23 to 0.64 wt % at 298 K and 60 bar. Interestingly,
the preparation of composites based on HKUST-1 is an active and attractive
research area,16,17 and thus, new and remarkable
examples have shown exciting applications (e.g., H2 storage,
catalysis, chromatography, CO2 capture, and lithium–sulfur
batteries).43,45,47,52−54

Motivated by the
remarkable results by Furukawa and other research
groups,18−22 we have synthesized and fully characterized an SWCNT-HKUST-1 composite
(SWCNT@HKUST-1, see Scheme 1). We are interested in synthesizing composite adsorbent MOF
materials capable to capture high amounts of CO2 in parallel
with our previous studies on H2 storage.23−25 Thus, in this
contribution we show for the first time, to the best of our knowledge,
the synthesis and characterization of a composite material based on
SWCNTs and HKUST-1 entitled SWCNT@HKUST-1, along with its enhanced
CO2 adsorption properties.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Strategy
for SWCNT@HKUST-1
HKUST-1 synthesis consists of
the dropwise addition of a copper ethanolic solution into an aqueous
solution of the deprotonated ligand, affording cuboctahedral crystals.
When the SWCNTs are added into the mixture, the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite
is obtained.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic
acid (H2BTC, 95%), copper nitrate trihydrate (99.99%),
nitric acid (70%),
sodium bicarbonate (>99.7%), and sulfuric acid (98%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Anhydrous ethanol (99%, Aldrich)
and deionized water were used as solvents. The SWCNTs (≥90%)
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich with a narrow diameter of 0.83 nm
and were used for the preparation of the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite material.
Ultrapure grade (99.9995%) N2 and CO2 gases
were obtained from Praxair.

Synthesis of HKUST-1
HKUST-1 was
synthesized as reported
by Loera-Serna et al.25 Quantities of 2.38
mmol of H2BTC and 7.14 mmol of NaHCO3 (1:3 ratio)
were dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water. Then, a solution which
contains 3.57 mmol of copper nitrate trihydrate (3:2 Cu(NO3)2/H2BTC ratio) and 40 mL of ethanol was added
dropwise, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 12 h. The obtained HKUST-1 product was isolated by centrifugation
and dried at 323 K for 2 h, with a 89.6% yield in dry basis.

Functionalization
of SWCNTs
The SWCNTs were functionalized
before the composite synthesis. SWCNTs were mixed in a concentrated
acid solution (3:1 H2SO4/HNO3 ratio),
and the reaction mixture was stirred at 353 K for 24 h. The functionalized
SWCNTs were recovered by filtration, washed with deionized water,
and dried at 353 K for 24 h.26

Synthesis of
the SWCNT@HKUST-1 Composite
The functionalized
SWCNTs were added in situ during the synthesis of HKUST-1 along with
the raw materials to synthesize the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite material.
Different amounts of functionalized SWCNTs were used, 2, 5, and 10
wt %.

General Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns
were collected on a Rigaku diffractometer, Ultima IV with a Cu Kα1
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) using a nickel filter. Patterns were recorded in the 5–60°
2θ range with a step scan of 0.02° and a scan rate of 0.1°
min–1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed
in a TA Instruments Thermobalance, Q500 HR under N2 atmosphere
using the Hi-Res mode with a maximum rate of 5 K min–1 (sensitivity 1, resolution 5), from room temperature to 1073 K.
Scanning electron microscopy micrographs were collected using a JEOL
Benchtop Microscope, Neoscope JCM-6000. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs were collected using a JEOL microscope, JEM-ARM200F;
image processing was carried out in the DigitalMicrograph software
form Gatan.

Raman Spectroscopy Experiments
The
Raman spectra were
collected using a Nicolet Almega XR-dispersive Raman spectrometer
from Thermo Scientific; samples were excited with a focused green
laser beam (λ = 523 nm). As-synthesized HKUST-1 and the SWCNT@HKUST-1
composite were measured at room temperature. The CO2-loaded
samples were activated prior to measurement; activation was carried
out in a quartz tube at 393 K for 1 h; samples were cooled down to
room temperature to acquire the spectra.

Adsorption Isotherms for
N2, CO2, and
EtOH
N2 isotherms (up to P/P0 = 1 and 77 K) were recorded on a BELSORP mini
II analyzer under high vacuum in a clean system with a diaphragm pumping
system. CO2 isotherms (up to 1 bar and 196 K) were recorded
on a BELSORP HP (high-pressure) analyzer. Prior to measurement samples
were activated under vacuum (0.1 Pa) at 393 K for 1 h. Ethanol isotherms
were measured at 303 K by a gravimetric method in a DVS Advantage
1 apparatus from Surface Measurement System, UK. This instrument consists
of a Cahn microbalance (mass sensitivity: 0.1 μg), with a digital
optical microscope, set up in an exactly controlled temperature and
vapor pressure chamber (accuracy: 0.1 K and 0.7% P/P0; respectively). Dry, and high-purity
nitrogen was used as the carrier gas.

Results and Discussion
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the HKUST-1 and 5 wt
% SWCNT@HKUST-1 samples are compared in Figure 1; comparison of all different SWCNTs’
loading is presented in Figure S2. All
the diffraction peaks have been thoroughly indexed as cubic crystalline
HKUST-1, corroborating that the MOF structure was not affected by
the incorporation of SWCNTs. The cell parameters, determined in the
(731) peak, were 26.27 and 26.14 Å for HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1,
respectively. The cell parameter value of the synthesized HKUST-1
is lower compared to that already reported for HKUST-1 (26.343 Å).1 These results suggest that the synthetic procedures
employed herein provided materials with a slightly compacted cell
in comparison with solely HKUST-1, possibly due to the absence of
solvent molecules in the pores of HKUST-1.

Figure 1 PXRD patterns of the
HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 samples;
the inset shows the SWCNT characteristic peaks.

The reported HKUST-1 structure comprises three different
cavities,
with the capability of interconnecting pores within the net, thus
forming channels. The largest channel shows, vertex to vertex (of
the cuboctahedral cavity), Cu–OH2···H2O–Cu distances of 19.88 Å. The second one exhibits
Cu···Cu distances of 18.62 Å. Meanwhile, the smallest
channel shows COO···COO distances of 15.89 Å.6 This suggests that HKUST-1 does not exhibit enough
space to host SWCNT within its channels. A more plausible scenario
is where SWCNTs could serve as a growing template or a crystallization
seed for the HKUST-1. This type of templated growth has been reported
in several nanostructures coated with MOFs, for different applications.41−51 The difference between the crystal morphology of the HKUST-1 (cuboctahedron)
with the thin rod crystals of the 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 (see Figure S3) points to this templated growth.

SWCNT characteristic reflections were identified in the PXRD pattern
of the 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 sample, at 45.2° and 51.7° (2θ).
It should be emphasized that XRD only detects crystalline compounds
when the crystallite content is above ca. 3.0%.3,27,28 Thus, SWCNTs should be present in a concentration
of ca. 3.0%, in order to be identified by PXRD. An approximate amount
of SWCNT 4.5% was estimated (comparing relative intensities from the
PXRD experiment) in the 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 sample. This was made
by using a differential intensity analysis of all diffracted peaks,
considering that the two main peaks of SWCNT (at 45.2° and 51.7°)
have different intensities in comparison to HKUST-1.

Table 1 summarizes
the principal physicochemical (crystallographic) results of the synthesized
HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, which are:(a) The smaller intensity
ratio of I222/I422 reveals
high electronic density content in X → Cu sites and thus the
presence of carbon nanotubes in the outer or interaction surface instead
of MOF cavities, as stated in Table 1.

(b) The
small diffraction reflection at
5.9° (2θ) which corresponds to the (111) reflection, where
this variation has been also observed in a previous contribution,6 that could be associated with the absence of
solvent molecules in the HKUST-1 pores.

(c) The elemental analysis of HKUST-1
and SWCNT@HKUST-1 was also determined by Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy
(EDX); the difference in copper content was 39.94%. These determinations
were made by averaging the EDXs of 10 different zones in the micrographs
of each material. The elemental analysis shows a consistent increase
in the percentage of carbon in the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite because
of the presence of the SWCNTs.



Table 1 Structural Parameters of HKUST-1 and
SWCNT@HKUST-1
material	a0 Å	D nm	I200/I220	% of carbon	
HKUST-1	26.67	26.93	0.65	70.03 ± 0.59	
SWCNT@HKUST-1	26.14	19.04	1.04	74.45 ± 6.51	
The thermal stability of HKUST-1 and the 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite
was investigated by TGA (Figure S1). The
weight loss at temperatures lower than 398 K was attributed to the
loss of weakly bound guest water molecules (desolvation of the structure),
34.94 and 25.98% for HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, respectively.
Also, in the weight derivative it is observed that the desolvation
of the 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite occurs at a lower temperature
in comparison to the HKUST-1. This result suggests that the composite
is more hydrophobic than the HKUST-1 because of the hydrophobic nature
of the SWCNT. From 373 to 500 K weight losses of 32.11 and 41.09%
were observed for HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, respectively,
attributed to the BTC decomposition. Therefore, the thermal stability
of the HKUST-1 decreased 46.7 K by incorporating SWCNT.

TEM
images are shown in Figure 2, exhibiting the dimensions of the HKUST-1 crystal
ranging from ca. 10 to 50 nm. The cubic symmetry of the HKUST-1 is
also reflected in the shape of the crystals (Figure 2a). TEM images of the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite
material pointed that the SWCNTs are indeed well incorporated with
HKUST-1 (Figure 2b).
Actually, SWCNTs function as templates where microcrystals of HKUST-1
grow on top of their surface. This can be observed on the TEM image
at low magnification (Figure 2b). Thus, TEM micrographs suggest that SWCNTs were not inside
the pores of the HKUST-1 as expected.29 Black spots appear in the edges of the HKUST-1 crystals. This is
due to their sensitivity to the electron beam and, under standard
experimental conditions, the copper oxide is formed after only few
minutes, as it has been shown for similar systems,29Figure 2b.

and (c) high magnification, (d,e) selected area electron diffraction
for the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite, and (f) elemental mapping (blue:
copper; green: carbon; red: oxygen) of the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite.

The high-resolution images of
the composite (Figure 2c) also show two distinctive
lattice spacings of 6.3 and 9.06 Å, which correspond to the interlayer
spacing values for the (400) and (220) planes of HKUST-1. These planes
were identified by their selected area electron diffraction (Figure 2d,e). No evidence
was found of SWCNTs on the surface of the composite. It was assumed
that the HKUST-1 crystals were formed by heteronucleation. This might
be due to the growth of HKUST-1 on the surface of the functional groups
on SWCNTs, leading to the growth of the MOF on the outside of
the tubes. However, it was very difficult to characterize the interface
region between the SWCNTs and the MOF by using available techniques.
Nonetheless, long crystals were obtained for the SWCNT@HKUST-1
composite, a nontypical HKUST-1 crystal habit which hint a templated
growth, where the composite retains the SWCNT rod-like shape (Figure 2f). The width of
these rod-like crystals varies from 170 to 350 nm (Figure S4); thus, a nanometric size composite (SWCNT@HKUST-1)
was obtained.

In order to determine the SWCNT incorporation
on the SWCNT@HKUST-1
composite, Raman experiments were carried out (Figures 3 and S7). Interestingly,
the characteristic stretching vibration modes of the carbon nanotubes
were clearly observed, see Figure 3. Raman shift for the D-, G-, and G′-bands for
the SWCNTs were observed in the Raman spectra, at 1370, 1586, and
2650 cm–1, respectively (see Figure 3).30 An additional
band found at 1137 cm–1 can be associated with surface-modified
SWCNTs with COO-attached groups.31 Typical
HKUST-1 Raman peaks were identified in both samples (Figure 3).10,32,33 Bands associated with the C=C modes
form the benzene ring that appeared at 1003 and 1610 cm–1; the latter appeared as a shoulder next to the G-band from the SWCNTs
in the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite spectra. Symmetric and asymmetric –COO
modes form the carboxylates that appeared at 1460 and 1540 cm–1, respectively. SWCNT@HKUST-1 signals red-shifted
to 1427 and 1527 cm–1. Copper OMS can be difficult
to observe because of the hygroscopic nature of these sites. Both
H2O-coordinated and OMS bands are observed at 169 and 228
cm–1 respectively;34−36 for the SWCNT@HKUST-1
composite this H2O-coordinated peak is relatively smaller
than the OMS peak because of a more hydrophobic nature of the composite.

spectra for HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, highlighting
the SWCNT bands.

The textural homogeneity
of HKUST-1 and the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composites
is reflected on the nitrogen adsorption isotherms presented in Figure 4. They have a well-defined
type-I shape indicating microporosity and pores with a uniform size,
which agrees with the structure of HKUST-1. From these isotherms,
the parameters of the porous structures were calculated and are presented
in Table 2. The composite
with 5 wt % SWCNT has ca. 20% higher surface area and pore volume
than HKUST-1. The sample with 2 wt % of SWCNT shows a little increase
in the surface area, with respect to the HKUST-1. Conversely, the
sample with 10 wt % SWCNT showed a decrease in the surface area. It
is worth to mention that the mechanical mixture of HKUST-1 and SWCNT
in the same proportion to the composite (vide supra, Experimental Section) did not show any enhanced surface area.
These results suggest that HKUST-1 particles are well dispersed on
the SWCNT surface, increasing the accessible area. The difference
between pore diameters is less evident than the surface areas and
pore volumes. The pore distribution shows a marked difference around
0.8–0.9 nm (inset Figure 4), where the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composites show a local
maximum. This may be associated with the presence of the SWCNTs with
a diameter of ca. 0.83 nm.

CO2 adsorption isotherms at 196 K were measured for
all materials (Figure 5). HKUST-1 and SWCNT@HKUST-1 composites were activated prior to measurements
at 393 K for 1 h, vide supra. HKUST-1 adsorbed a total amount of 7.92
mmol g–1 of CO2. An enhanced CO2 adsorption was observed for the 2 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite
with 8.23 and 8.75 mmol g–1, respectively. This
can be explained by the augment in the surface area provided by the
incorporation of the SWCNTs, although when a 10 wt % load is reached,
the CO2 uptake does not show any improvement. Additionally,
CO2 adsorption isotherms were carried out at 213 and 231
K for the 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 material to estimate the isosteric
heat of adsorption (see the Supporting Information). The 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 CO2 isosteric heat of
adsorption (39.1 kJ mol–1) was greater than that
reported for the HKUST-1 (30 kJ mol–1).

Figure 5 HKUST-1 and
SWCNT@HKUST-1 composites’ CO2 adsorption
isotherms at 196 K.

The adsorption of CO2 in HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1
was investigated by in situ Raman experiments (Figure 6). The samples were activated in a quartz
cell prior to the experiments, vide supra. First, the analysis on
HKUST-1 demonstrated the characteristic Cu–Cu vibration band
at 228 cm–1 (from the copper paddlewheel) red-shifted
to 216 cm–1 upon CO2 adsorption (see Figure 6a). Despite the HKUST-1
sample being activated and then exposed to pure CO2 gas,
the characteristic band associated with the interaction Cu–Cu–CO2 (open metal site), at approximately 220 cm–1, appeared as a small shoulder next to the characteristic band associated
with OMS (Figure 6a).
Although HKUST-1 was fully activated, the Raman spectra evidenced
the presence coordinated water (because of the hygroscopic nature
of HKUST-1), and it was observed in both spectra at 169 and 167 cm–1 (Figure 6a). These water molecules occupied the preferential adsorption
sites and prevented CO2 adsorption (small shoulder at 220
cm–1).38 In the case
of the sample 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, the characteristic OMS vibration
band was also found to be well defined at 242 cm–1(Figure 6b), and a
sharp band at 216 cm–1 corroborated the CO2 adsorption in the composite (Figure 6b). The bands corresponding to coordinated water in
5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, at 177 and 174 cm–1, showed
smaller intensities in comparison to HKUST-1. The characteristic H2O-coordinated band red-shifted (approximately 2–3 cm–1) in both materials (HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1)
when CO2 is adsorbed. This shift suggests a small interaction
between CO2 and the coordinated water. A characteristic
CO2 Fermi resonance band appeared at 1393 cm–1 for both samples (HKUST-1 and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, see the inset
of Figure 6). This
can be attributed to free CO2 molecules inside the measurement
system. Interestingly, an additional band appeared upon the CO2 adsorption at 1382 cm–1 for HKUST-1 (see
the inset of Figure 6a). This was associated with CO2 coordinated to HKUST-1,
providing additional evidence of the relatively strong CO2–MOF interaction.38 Evidence of
the CO2 coordination with the 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 was
also found at 1372 cm–1 (see the inset of Figure 6b).

Figure 6 Raman spectra for (a)
HKUST-1 and (b) 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, before
and after CO2 adsorption.

Finally, evidence of increased hydrophobicity for the composite
(SWCNT@HKUST-1) was suggested by our Raman spectroscopy results. As
HKUST-1 is water-unstable, ethanol (EtOH) sorption experiments were
selected to investigate such hydrophobicity. We have previously demonstrated
that HKUST-1 was stable toward this polar solvent (EtOH),39 and provided us the guideline to investigate
the hydrophobicity of the composite (SWCNT@HKUST-1). Then, the EtOH
adsorption for HKSUT-1 showed a total of 54.6 wt % uptake, which decreased
(to 49.2 wt %) upon SWCNT inclusion (see Figure 7, HKUST-1 and SWCNT@HKUST-1 EtOH uptakes).
The EtOH adsorption isotherm for HKUST-1exhibited a steep increase
at low P/P0 values, reaching
saturation at 10 P/P0 (see Figure 7). Such
a rapid EtOH uptake suggests a strong affinity for EtOH. Conversely,
the EtOH adsorption for SWCNT@HKUST-1 showed a considerably less steeped
uptake increase and the saturation point was shifted to greater P/P0 values (20 P/P0), see Figure 7, indicating a reduced affinity for EtOH.
These results demonstrate an enhanced hydrophobicity for the SWCNT@HKUST-1
composite.

Figure 7 Ethanol adsorption–desorption isotherms at 303 K for HKUST-1
and 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1.

Raman experiments can be correlated with the observed adsorption
properties. The evidence of CO2 molecules coordinated to
the OMS in both materials (Figure 6) gave us an insight on the level of interaction between
CO2 and the OMS. The signal ratios for the Cu–Cu–CO2 (220 cm–1) and Cu–Cu (240 cm–1) bands are higher for the SWCNT@HKUST-1 composite.
This observation can be interpreted as a strong CO2 interaction
with the composite in comparison to the bare HKUST-1. The heat of
adsorption for CO2 corroborates this hypothesis, 39.1 kJ
mol–1 for SWCNT@HKUST-1 over 30 kJ mol–1 for HKUST-1; this increase can be associated with the shape of the
rod-like crystals. The nanometric width of the crystals leads to a
better access to the centers of these, where presumably the SWCNTs
can be found and provide an extra CO2 adsorption site.40

Conclusions
The synthesis of a new
composite based on HKUST-1 and SWCNTs was
successfully demonstrated. A comprehensive characterization set (PXRD,
TGA, TEM, EDX, and Raman spectroscopy) for the composite 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1
confirmed the growing of HKUST-1 on the surface of SWCNTs and the
nanosize of the composite. N2 adsorption isotherms corroborated
a higher surface area and pore volume for 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1 than
HKUST-1. These results suggested that HKUST-1 particles are well dispersed
on the SWCNT surface, increasing the accessible area. A mechanical
mixture of HKUST-1 and SWCNTs in the same proportion to the composite
(Experimental Section) did not show any enhanced
surface area. This confirmed the chemical deposition of HKUST-1 on
the surface of SWCNTs. CO2 adsorption experiments, at 196
K, demonstrated an enhanced CO2 capture for 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1
(8.75 mmol g–1) over HKUST-1 (7.92 mmol g–1). Isosteric heat of adsorption for CO2 was also estimated
to be higher for the composite (form 30 kJ mol–1 for HKUST-1 to 39.1 kJ mol–1 for 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1).
In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the preferential CO2 adsorption sites on 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1, corroborated its higher
CO2 heat of adsorption, and evidenced the augmented hydrophobicity
of the composite. Finally, such hydrophobicity of the composite was
investigated by the adsorption of ethanol vapor, finding a reduced
affinity to EtOH in comparison to HKUST-1. Thus, 5 wt % SWCNT@HKUST-1
has demonstrated interesting properties which enlarge the research
on MOF composites.46,55
