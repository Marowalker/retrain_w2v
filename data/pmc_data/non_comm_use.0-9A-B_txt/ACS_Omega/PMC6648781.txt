A novel
nanoprobe was designed and synthesized by functionalizing
chitosan–carbon dots (CDs) with a modified bipyridine-based
heterocyclic molecule, 4-(pyridine-2-yl)-3H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]quinoline (PPQ), to detect trace amount of water via fluorescence
methods. The functionalized CDs (PPQ-CDs) were thoroughly characterized
using dynamic light scattering, UV–vis, X-ray diffraction,
Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy, and NMR techniques. The modified
fluorescence intensity of PPQ-CDs was found to be an excellent indicator
for water in organic solvents. The PPQ-CDs showed very weak fluorescence
intensity in organic solvents due to a possible photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) process between PPQ pyrrole nitrogen and acceptor groups
of CDs. However, sequential addition of trace amount of water led
to continuous enhancement in the fluorescence intensity for the PPQ-CD
nanocomposites. The mechanism was proposed to follow suppression of
the PET process due to the formation of “free-ions”
by the proton transfer from the CD carboxyl group to pyrrole nitrogen
through water bridging. The limit of water detection was determined
to be 0.023% (v/v) in DMSO.

1 Introduction
Carbon
dots (CDs)1,2 have recently drawn increasing
attention due to their important qualities like water solubility,
tunable fluorescence, biocompatibility, chemical inertness, facile
and inexpensive synthesis, and good photostability. Most importantly,
their intrinsic fluorescence and nontoxicity render them as attractive
substitutes to traditional quantum dots.3,4 These carbon
nanoparticles are typically less than 10 nm and predominantly composed
of carbon. The CDs can be synthesized by a “top-down”
approach5 by breaking down larger carbon
materials, which mainly includes laser ablation,6 arc discharge,7 and electrochemical
oxidation,5 whereas a “bottom-up”
approach8 is building CDs from smaller
carbon sources, which includes microwave syntheses,9 combustion,10 or supported synthetic11 methods.

Due to the tunable optical properties
of CDs, they can be used
to develop a smart sensing system for biomolecules,12−15 metal ions,16−20 organic pollutants,21 and
trace amount of water.22 Depending on the
route of synthesis and the materials used, the amino, carboxyl, and
hydroxyl groups remain on the CD surfaces in different proportions.23 They not only ensure water solubility but also
provide further scopes for surface passivation and functionalization.
There is a significant impact of surface functionalization on the
photoluminescence properties of CDs. The functionalization on the
CD surfaces can be achieved either by covalent or noncovalent interactions.24 Covalent interactions include the reaction of
the functional molecule with the −COOH or −NH2 groups present on the CD surfaces. Noncovalent interactions include
van der Waals force or π interactions between the CDs and molecules
used in the functionalization process. Gupta et al.25 have synthesized nitrogen-doped PEGylated CDs from chitosan
gels and functionalized them with dithiothreitol (DTT) for sensing
Hg2+ at the picomolar level. Li et al.26 have developed a lanthanide-based hybrid on–off–on
optical nanoprobe through the functionalization of CDs with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
dianhydride for detecting biomarker 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid
(DPA), Cu(II), and biothiols. In another study, Jiang et al. have
synthesized white light-emitting CDs (WCDs) using Tween 80 as the
carbon source,27 as the long-chain alkyl
group on the surface of the WCDs suppressed aggregation-caused quenching.
Further, the surface groups of the WCDs detected lipophilic substances
and applied for label-free luminescence imaging of the latent fingerprint.

On the other hand, in synthetic chemistry, it is extremely important
to exclude water from the reaction mixture. While using water-sensitive
reagents in the laboratory, dehydration procedures are routinely performed
beforehand to confirm that no water is present such that reproducible
observations are obtained, because a trace amount of water in organic
solvents can adversely affect the course of some of the most common
organic reactions such as Grignard reaction, Wittig reaction, Friedel–Crafts
reaction, Claisen condensation, etc. However, it is usually a difficult
and tedious process for an organic chemist to ensure the anhydrous
conditions at a common laboratory setup. Therefore, practical, rapid,
and naked-eye detection for determining trace amount of water contaminant
is highly useful on a day-to-day basis without using sophisticated
analytical instruments. Recently, metal–organic framework (MOF)-based
fluorescent nanoprobes were also used to detect trace water in organic
solvents28−30 via a ratiometric method. However, the main drawbacks
with MOF substrates are the complicated synthesis and possibility
of leaking of the photoactive guests into the solution. Traditionally,
the Karl Fischer method31 is used for measuring
trace amount of water content in a sample, but compared to the sophisticated
traditional method, fluorescence-based optical sensors32,33 have become more popular due to their selectivity, sensitivity,
easy fabrication, and simple analysis of the result. However, many
of the probes were used to determine the water content by quenching
the original fluorescence signal.34−36 Hence, it is important
to develop and study simple, less expensive, and advantageous fluorescent
“turn-on”37 sensors for water
detection.

In this report, we have prepared PEGylated CDs from
chitosan gels
and functionalized the CDs with a bipyridine-based heterocyclic molecule,
4-(pyridine-2-yl)-3H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]quinoline (PPQ),38−40 through covalently conjugating PPQ on the CD surfaces
using carbodiimide chemistry.41 The functionalized
PPQ-CDs show very weak fluorescence intensity in organic solvents
due to the possible PET process between PPQ and acceptor groups of
CDs. However, they work wonderfully well as a turn-on fluorescent
sensor with the addition of trace amount of water in organic solvents.
Successive addition of the water content leads to continuous enhancement
in fluorescence intensity for the PPQ-CD nanocomposites. The mechanism
for the enhancement is believed to follow suppression of the PET process
due to the formation of “free-ions” by intramolecular
proton rearrangement. Additionally, under ambient conditions, a naked-eye
visual detection protocol was also demonstrated using a simple UV
chamber, available in most of the laboratories.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 DLS, UV–vis, XRD,
and FTIR Studies
Scheme 1 depicted
the functionalization process of CDs with PPQ, where the −COOH
group on the CD surface reacted with pyrrole −NH to form an
amide linkage via carbodiimide chemistry. The free CDs and the functionalized
product (PPQ-CD) were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS),
UV–vis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques.

Scheme 1 Schematic of the Stepwise Functionalization of the CD Surfaces with
PPQ
The sizes of the as-prepared
CDs and PPQ-CDs were measured by DLS
and HRTEM techniques (Figure 1A). From DLS measurements, the particle sizes were found to
be in the ranges of 2.3–5.6 nm and 2.7–7.6 nm for CDs
and PPQ-CDs, respectively. Thus, the increase in size for PPQ-CDs
compared to CDs suggested that there was a coupling of PPQ with the
functional groups on the surface of CDs. In fact, the obtained sizes
measured by DLS showed the hydrodynamic radius of the particles with
maxima at 3.4 and 4.3 nm for CDs and PPQ-CDs, respectively. However,
the HRTEM image of the same PPQ-CDs furnished a smaller size compared
to that obtained from DLS as the particles were estimated to be in
the range of 3–4.8 nm with a maximum at 3.9 nm. Further, we
performed absorption studies for CDs, PPQ, and PPQ-CDs individually
to confirm the functionalization process (Figure 1B). The UV–vis spectrum of CDs in
water showed the peaks at 264 and 330 nm, which were present due to
π–π* transitions of the C–C structure.25 The absorption peak values were similar to the
CDs already reported in the literature.42 PPQ in DMF also showed a main absorption peak at 340 nm. However,
the absorption spectra of PPQ-CDs in water represented a combination
of PPQ and CDs absorption features with an overall red shift in the
spectra due to the difference in solvent polarity (Figure 1B(ii)). The surface functionalization
process was further characterized by XRD technique (Figure 1C). A broad peak at 2Θ
= 23° was seen for CDs (Figure 1C(i)), confirming the presence of mainly highly distorted
carbon atoms.43 In Figure 1C(ii), several sharp peaks in the range of
2Θ = 15–30° were observed for the PPQ molecule,
whereas the obtained XRD pattern in Figure 1C(iii) was also found to be commensurate
with the functionalization process as both sharp peaks of the PPQ
molecule were observed with a small shift in the peak values along
with slight peak broadening around 2Θ = 23° from CDs. FTIR
measurements were also performed for further verification of the coupling
of PPQ on the CD surface (Figure 1D). The FTIR spectrum of CDs showed a strong peak at
1651 cm–1, indicating the presence of the −COOH
group,25 whereas the broad peak around
3421 cm–1 corresponded to −OH and −NH
stretching vibrations.44 The peaks at 2915
and 1107 cm–1 corresponded to C–H stretching
and C–O bond stretching, respectively. The covalent attachment
of PPQ onto the CD surface was confirmed by the shift of the carbonyl
peak of carboxylic acid from 1651 to 1636 cm–1,
endorsing the formation of an amide linkage.45 Meanwhile, during the functionalization process, the intermediate
acylation step for CDs was also confirmed by the presence of the −COCl
peak at 1709 cm–1. Moreover, the observation obtained
from a simple thin-layer chromatography (TLC) experiment (Figure S5) suggested that PPQ was covalently
bound with the hydrophilic CDs as the retardation factor (Rf) for PPQ-CDs was found to be zero, while for
free PPQ, it was 0.5 in 10% ethyl acetate/hexane solution.

2.2 1H NMR Study
1H NMR spectra of PPQ and
PPQ-CDs are shown in Figure 2. The NMR experiment for PPQ was carried
out in deuterated DMSO, but PPQ-CDs were dissolved in D2O. The peaks obtained in the range of 7–13 ppm in Figure 2(i) were due to the
heteroaromatic ring protons of the PPQ molecule. On the other hand,
the PPQ-CDs contained the characteristic peaks of both PPQ and CDs.
The appearance of broad peaks around 6–9 ppm in Figure 2(ii) could be assigned to the
heteroaromatic protons of PPQ. The sharp peaks at 1.23 and 2.67 ppm
were due to the protons from CDs.22

DMSO and (ii) PPQ-CDs in D2O.

Hence, this result further indicated the successful functionalization
of the PPQ molecule on the CD surfaces. Additionally, the peak around
12.24 ppm that corresponds to the NH proton remained absent in PPQ-CD
spectra, which further confirmed the conjugation of the PPQ molecule
with CDs.

2.3 XPS Studies
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) is a powerful technique to probe the surface composition and
was therefore chosen to probe the surface chemical composition of
pure CDs and functionalized CDs (Figure 3). In XPS, it is known that the appearance
of peaks around 286, 400, and 532 eV corresponds to C 1s, N 1s, and
O 1s, respectively.46 After deconvolution,
the C 1s XPS spectrum of CDs consisted of three peaks corresponding
to the sp2-hybridized carbon atom C=C/C–C
at 284.7 eV, C–OH at 286.3 eV, and O=C—O—
of the carboxylic group at 288.57 eV. After functionalization, new
peaks were observed confirming the formation of an amide linkage between
the carboxylic group of CDs and NH of the PPQ molecule. The peak of
PPQ-CD at 285.34 eV confirmed the presence of C–N from the
amide group, while other two peaks at 284.06 and 285.72 eV could be
assigned to C=C and C–OH, respectively. The N 1s spectrum
of CDs consisted of two peaks at 399.14 and 407 eV, which could be
assigned to nitrogen in the forms of N–C and N–H, respectively,
but after functionalization, a single peak around 399.94 eV was observed,
which probably corresponded to nitrogen in the form of C3N (aromatic nitrogen of pyrrole involved in the formation of the
amide linkage). The XPS spectrum of O 1s of CDs contained three peaks
at 531.7, 532.60, and 536.29 eV, which were ascribed to oxygen in
the forms of C–OH, O=C—O—, and H–O–H,
respectively. After functionalization, a single peak at 531.70 eV
was observed, representing the C–OH group only on the CD surface,
indicating the disappearance of the O=C—O— peak
as carboxylic acid of CDs was converted to amide after PPQ functionalization
(Figure 3). Apart from
this, the elemental analysis data obtained from XPS for CDs and PPQ-CDs
(Table S1) suggested that CDs were composed
mainly of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and the content of each element
had increased slightly after functionalization, which perhaps the
confirmed successful conjugation of PPQ with CDs.

CDs and PPQ-CDs: (a, d) C 1s, (b, e)
N 1s, and (c, f) O 1s.

2.4 Application of PPQ-CDs in Water Detection
The as-prepared CDs showed a characteristic behavior of excitation
wavelength-dependent photoluminescence intensity (Figure 4). It was seen that the emission
bands were shifted bathochromically with increasing excitation wavelength,
which showed the distribution of surface energy traps on the CDs.33,47 It showed an emission maximum at ∼450 nm when excited at
350 nm; therefore, all further experiments were also carried out at
350 nm excitation.

Figure 4 Normalized fluorescence intensity of chitosan–CDs
in water
when excited at different wavelengths.

After functionalization, the emission spectra of PPQ-CDs
were collected
in different dry organic solvents like ethanol, THF (tetrahydrofuran),
DCM (dichloromethane), DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), DMF (dimethylformamide),
toluene, and including water. As shown in Figure 5, the emission intensity of PPQ-CDs was found
to be maximum in water, while in other organic solvents, the emission
was evidently quenched when excited at 350 nm. The quenching of fluorescence
could be due to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process from
nitrogen of PPQ to the acceptor of the CDs. This observation prompted
us to contemplate PPQ-CDs as a potential turn-on fluorescent sensor
for water detection in organic solvents.

Figure 5 (a) Fluorescence spectra
of PPQ-CDs (λex = 350
nm) in different solvents and water. (b) Bar plot showing the fluorescence
intensity of PPQ-CDs at 450 nm in various solvents.

Among different solvents, DMSO was selected as
it showed the minimum
fluorescence intensity for PPQ-CDs (Figure 5b). If we compare the PET process in EtOH
and DMSO, it is known that the rate of PET is much slower in polar
protic solvent EtOH compared to the rate of PET in polar aprotic solvents.48 The probable reason was cited as the ordered
structure of EtOH due to H-bonding. So, in our case, the minimum fluorescence
intensity of PPQ-CDs was observed in DMSO, probably due to the efficient
PET process in an aprotic solvent devoid of H-bonding. First, we collected
the absorption spectra of PPQ-CDs in different DMSO/water mixture
solutions, where water concentrations were increased successively
(Figure S1). As evident from the study,
there was no appreciable change in the optical density and shape of
the peaks upon the stepwise addition of water, indicating only weak
ground state interactions. However, with the successive increase in
the water content, the fluorescence intensity of PPQ-CDs in DMSO increased
continuously as shown in Figure S2 and Figure 6a. As shown in Figure 6b, the fluorescence
intensity increased linearly with increasing water content (0–40%,
v/v), and then the increase was quadratic in nature from 40 to 68%
(v/v) water addition. We observed that the quantum yield of CDs also
increased from 12% (without functionalization) to 25% (after water
addition to the PPQ-CDs; Calculation S1). The calibration curve for water detection is shown below in Figure 6b, which follows
the equation F = 7.22 × [H2O] + 27.68
(R2 = 0.99, [H2O] = 0–68%),
where F stands for the emission intensity of PPQ-CDs
in DMSO upon addition of water.

of PPQ-CDs in DMSO with increasing water content (0–68%). (b)
Calibration curves as a function of water content (0–68%, v/v)
in DMSO.

The water content in DMSO can
be quantitatively detected through
the known calibration equation.22 On the
basis of the following equation, the detection limit (DL) of the sensor
can be estimated as  where σ is the standard deviation and K is the slope of the calibration curve. The DL of PPQ-CDs
was found to be 0.023% in DMSO.

Moreover, the sensing process
was instantaneous, as revealed by
the time-dependent fluorescence intensity data of the sensor (Figure S11). After DMSO, water detection was
also carried out with two more organic solvents, namely, ethanol and
DMF (Figures S8 and S9). Similar enhancement
in the emission intensity of PPQ-CDs was registered with an increase
in the water content. The detection limits were found to be 0.092%
(v/v) in ethanol and 0.32% (v/v) in DMF. In fact, when compared with
the previous reports for water detection using CDs, the DL obtained
from the current work is comparable among the peers (Table S2). Meanwhile, to confirm the substantial role of water
in the enhancement process, a comparative study was also performed,
where the same amount of DMF and Millipore water was successively
added to PPQ-CDs, and fluorescence intensities were measured. To our
satisfaction, it was found that in the case of Millipore water, the
enhancement was approximately 6–7 times more (Figure S6), indicating the crucial role played by water. Suitable
blank studies were also performed by functionalizing the CDs with
only oxalyl chloride (Figure S3) and oxalyl
chloride followed by aniline (Figure S4). In both cases, we have seen a decrease in emission intensity with
stepwise addition of water. Further, a continuous decrease in emission
intensity was also observed for free CDs with stepwise addition of
trace amount of water (Figure S7).

2.5 Mechanism of Water Detection
Due
to proton-accepting and conducting properties of water, it has been
the most widely used solvent for proton transfer studies. Water acts
as a passive medium for the initial deprotonation step in the proton
transport mechanism.49,50 The emission data showed the
fluorescence enhancement of PPQ-CDs with stepwise addition of water.
This enhancement could be attributed to the suppression of PET due
to the formation of PPQ-functionalized CDs with stable fluorescent
ionic species between the protonated nitrogen (proton acceptor/electron
donor) of PPQ and the carboxyl group (proton donor/electron acceptor)
on the surface of the CDs by hydrolysis. In Scheme 2, a simplified model was presented, where
the PPQ-CDs were initially nonfluorescent due to the PET process between
nitrogen of PPQ and the carboxyl group of CDs. With the addition of
water, the hydrogen-bonded complex (HBC) or water complex was formed.
Further, the complete system underwent proton rearrangement and reached
equilibrium with hydrogen-bonded ions (HBI). With more water, solvent-separated
ions (SSI) were formed when water molecules efficiently solvated HBI,
and finally SSI produced solvent-separated free ions (FI).51 Overall, the enhancement mechanism followed
an excited-state proton-transfer process from the CD surface to PPQ
through water bridging between the groups staying in close proximity.

of PPQ-CDs in DMSO/Water Media via Proton Transfer
Scheme 3 illustrates
the enhancement mechanism in terms of molecular orbitals of the acceptor
(CDs) and the donor (PPQ). Upon excitation of the fluorophore, an
electron of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was promoted
to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which enabled the
PET process from the HOMO of the donor (PPQ) to that of the fluorophore
(CDs).52 This resulted in fluorescence
quenching for the CDs, as the electron was prevented to come back
to the ground state by the radiative process. However, after protonation
at the quinoline nitrogen with the addition of water, the relevant
HOMO of the donor (PPQ) probably became lower in energy than that
of the CDs, such that it could not donate electrons anymore. Consequently,
PET was no longer possible, and the fluorescence intensity was increased.

of the Acceptor (CDs) and the Donor (PPQ)
2.6 Fluorescence Lifetime Studies
Fluorescence
lifetime measurement is considered as an important characterization
method, where a substantial decrease in the lifetime with associated
quenching will confirm the PET mechanism. Hence, we have recorded
the lifetime decay patterns for the as-prepared CDs in water, PPQ-CDs
in organic solvents, and PPQ-CDs in organic solvents followed by water
addition. As seen from the decay patterns (Figure 7a) and the lifetime values (Table 1), the PET mechanism was evident
for the functionalized CDs in organic solvents when compared to the
as-prepared CDs in water. The average lifetime was calculated using
the following equation53  where τi is the lifetime of the particular component,
αi is the contribution of that particular
component,
and τf is the average lifetime. It was observed that
PPQ-CDs have a nanosecond lifetime, which makes them suitable for
biological and optoelectronic applications.54 The multiple lifetime components implied that there were various
emission species on the surface of CDs. However, it was found that
the lifetimes of PPQ-CDs increased significantly with the addition
of water (Figure 7b
and Table 1) along
with the enhancement in the steady-state intensity. This was possible
as PET was nonoperational, and the fluorescence quenching was suppressed
with the addition of water (Scheme 3).

2.7 Visual Detection of Water with PPQ-CDs
A visual detection
protocol (Figure 8)
was also established, which was made possible by
taking the PPQ-CDs in DMSO in a solid matrix and thereby observing
their fluorescence with the addition of water. Similar visual detection
was reported recently for sensing H2O2 in different
natural water samples using functionalized vanadium oxide quantum
dots.55 For our study, MCM-41 nanoparticles
were synthesized from a known procedure56 and used as the solid matrix to encapsulate PPQ-CDs for the visual
detection of water. First, a TLC strip was covered with the MCM-41
powder at different locations to create the test spots. Then, 10 μL
of PPQ-CD solution in DMSO was added to each of them. For visual observation
of the fluorescence, the TLC test strip was kept under 365 nm UV lamp
illumination in the dark, and the photographs were taken using a camera.
It was found that, with the addition of water, the blue fluorescence
of the PPQ-CDs was clearly observed, and an increase in the intensity
was also found to be commensurate with the concentration of water,
while the spot containing only PPQ-CDs without water showed very weak
fluorescence intensity (Figure 8b), indicating the efficacy of the method for the visual detection
of water.

3 Conclusions
We have developed a nanosensor
by functionalizing the chitosan-based
CDs with a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecule for the rapid
and sensitive detection of trace amount of water present in the organic
solvents. The fluorescence intensity of the functionalized CDs was
quenched in organic solvents by PET, as confirmed by the steady-state
and fluorescence lifetime measurements, but, with the addition of
water, the electron-donating center was blocked by protonation due
to the intramolecular excited-state proton transfer process. As a
result, PET became ineffective, leading to instantaneous enhancement
in the fluorescence intensity. With 68% (v/v) water addition, a striking
∼40-fold enhancement in the fluorescence intensity was observed
in DMSO. However, free CDs and CDs functionalized with the molecule,
which was devoid of potential electron-donating centers, did not show
any enhancement with the addition of water. Further, we have also
shown a visual detection protocol for determining the water content
in a common laboratory setup with the aid of the UV excitation chamber.
The functionalized CDs may also find great potential applications
as a humidity sensor in environmental monitoring systems and paper
industry. Further works are underway by preparing various red-emitting
CDs and possible functionalization on them.

4 Materials

(Zetasizer nano series, Nano-ZS) at room temperature. Absorption spectra
of the samples were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 plus. XRD measurements
were performed on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray Diffractometer with Cu

4.3 Synthesis
of Chitosan–Carbon Dots
The CDs were synthesized using
the known25 microwave heating method in
which chitosan gel was used as a carbon
source and poly(ethylene glycol) as a passivating agent (Figure S10). In a glass vial, 4.5 mL of 2% chitosan
gel, 4.5 mL of 25% PEG (polyethylene glycol), and 1 mL of 5 M NaOH
were mixed. This mixture was subjected to microwave heating at 600
W power for 3 min at 100 °C. The resulting solution was dissolved
in 15 mL of distilled water and filtered with the 0.2 μm filter
paper. The filtered solution was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 h.
The supernatant was collected and lyophilized to use further for our
experiments.

4.4 Functionalization of the
CDs
To a
solution of 100 mg of CDs in 3 mL of anhydrous THF, 1 mL of oxalyl
chloride was added and stirred at room temperature for 6 h under a
N2 atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then concentrated
to remove unreacted oxalyl chloride. Further, 5 mg of PPQ dissolved
in anhydrous THF was added, and the resulting mixture was allowed
to stir for 12 h at 25 °C. Upon completion of the reaction, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue
was used for the fluorescence experiments.

4.5 Synthesis
of MCM-41 Nanoparticles for Visual
Detection of Water with PPQ-CDs
For the synthesis of MCM-41
nanoparticles,56 briefly, 0.83 g of CTAB,
4.54 mL of ammonia, 25 mL of ethanol were dissolved in 16 mL of deionized
water and stirred for 30 min. After that, 1.67 mL of TEOS was added
and allowed to stir for 1 h, and the obtained white powder was filtered
and washed with 50 mL of methanol and water and then dried at 550°
for 30 min in a crucible.
