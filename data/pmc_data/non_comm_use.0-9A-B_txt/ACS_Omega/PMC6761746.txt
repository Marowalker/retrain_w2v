Oxygen
vacancy-modified WO3–x nanorods
composited with g-C3N4 have been
synthesized via the chemisorption method. The crystalline structure,
morphology, composition, band structure, and charge separation mechanism
for WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterostructures are studied in detail. The g-C3N4 nanosheets are attached on the surface of WO3–x nanorods. The Z-scheme separation is confirmed by
the analysis of generated hydroxyl radicals. The electrons in the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of g-C3N4 and the holes in the valence band of WO3 can participate
in the photocatalytic reaction to reduce CO2 into CO. New
energy levels of oxygen vacancies are formed in the band gap of WO3, further extending the visible-light response, separating
the charge carriers in Z-scheme and prolonging the lifetime of electrons.
Therefore, the WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterostructures exhibit much higher photocatalytic
activity than the pristine g-C3N4.

1 Introduction
Photocatalytic
CO2 reduction is a promising way for
clean, low-cost, and environmentally friendly conversion of CO2 into fuels by utilizing the solar energy.1 Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)
has gained great attention recently as an easy-to-obtain and visible-light-responsive
nonmetal semiconductor photocatalyst that shows great stability and
nontoxicity.2−6 WO3 is also considered as a high-performance visible
photocatalyst with a band gap of 2.6–2.9 eV.6−8 During the last
decades, compositing WO3 with g-C3N4 has been investigated for efficient photocatalytic organic degradation,
water splitting, and CO2 reduction. Chen et al. investigated
the separation mechanisms of charge carriers for C3N4/WO3 composites.9 Huang
et al. synthesized WO3/g-C3N4 composites
with effective photocatalytic activity on the degradation of organic
pollutants.10 Liang et al. reported a three-dimensional
WO3 superstructure coupled with g-C3N4, which exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic performance.11 Moreover, WO3 composited with g-C3N4 Z-scheme photocatalyst has been reported by
several researchers for enhanced photocatalytic activity.11−14 Chai et al. synthesized WO3 nanoplate anchored on g-C3N4 Z-scheme photocatalyst with enhanced photocatalytic
activity.12 Lu et al. constructed g-C3N4/RGO/WO3 Z-scheme photocatalyst by
using graphene oxide as the electron mediator.15 However, the photocatalytic performance is still limited
and challenge remains to further improve the photocatalytic performance
of C3N4/WO3 heterostructures.

Recently, defect engineering in semiconductors has been widely
considered for improving the photocatalytic performance.16−24 The introduction of oxygen vacancy in WO3 can narrow
the band gap and separate the photoinduced carriers, resulting in
enhanced photocatalytic activities. Liu et al. found that the oxygen
vacancies in WO3 can promote the separation of charge carriers
and enhance the photocatalytic performance.19 Li et al. prepared defect-modified WO3 with enhanced
visible photocatalytic and electrochemical performance.18 Meng et al. induced oxygen vacancies on specific
surface of WO3 with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic
activity.23 However, most of the reports
have focused on the influence of oxygen vacancies on the WO3 photocatalyst itself. The effect of oxygen vacancies on the interface
of heterostructures, such as visible-light response, separation behaviors
of charge carriers, and lifetime of photogenerated electrons, is rarely
reported.

Herein, defect-engineered WO3–x nanorods are prepared by vacuum thermal treatment
and WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterostructures are
synthesized through a chemisorption method. The morphology structure,
band structure, and separation of electrons and holes are investigated
systematically. These WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterostructures exhibit a significantly improved
catalytic activity for reduction of CO2 into CO compared
to pristine g-C3N4, WO3, and WO3/g-C3N4. The introduced oxygen vacancies
would create defect energy levels below the conduction band of WO3 and facilitate the separation of charge carriers in Z-scheme
pathway. This work provides insights into practical applications of
Z-scheme heterostructures toward efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure WO3, WO3–x, and WxC3 (the abbreviations
of WO3–x/g-C3N4, and the nominal weight ratio of g-C3N4 to
WO3–x is 3%) samples and g-C3N4. Two diffraction peaks at 13.1 and 27.4°
are found for g-C3N4 samples, corresponding
to the (001) and (002) planes (JCPDS No. 87-1526). For pure WO3, only two obvious diffraction peaks at 23.0 and 46.9°
are observed, ascribed to the (001) and (002) planes of WO3, respectively (JCPDS No. 20-1324). Compared to the standard diffraction
data of WO3, no other diffraction peaks are observed. The
peak of (001) plane is significantly sharp, suggesting that the WO3 crystals grow preferentially along the c axis direction.
The XRD pattern of WO3–x is almost
the same as that of pure WO3, suggesting that the vacuum
thermal treatment does not change the crystal structure of WO3–x samples. After the compositing
process, the XRD patterns of WxC3 are
almost the same as those of pure WO3 and WO3–x samples. No additional peaks related to g-C3N4 are detected, which is probably due to the relative
low weight ratio of g-C3N4.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of pure
WO3, WO3–x, and WxC3 samples and g-C3N4.

The morphologies of the as-prepared nanostructures
(WC3 (the abbreviations
of WO3/g-C3N4, and the nominal weight
ratio of g-C3N4 to WO3 is 3%) and
WxC3) are shown in Figure 2. As shown in the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image in Figure 2a, the WC3 samples are composed of crystallized nanorods with a uniform
diameter of approximately 10 nm and length of 50–100 nm. It
is observed from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) image in Figure 2b that some WO3 nanorods are composited with g-C3N4 (TEM of pristine g-C3N4 shown
in Figure S1). In addition, the lattice
fringe is 0.39 nm corresponding to the (001) plane of WO3 (JCPDS No. 20-1324), which suggests that the growth of the WO3 nanorods is along the [001] direction. After the vacuum thermal
treatment (Figure 2c,d), the morphology of the nanorods remains almost unchanged and
the WO3–x nanorods are still composited
with g-C3N4. These TEM results are in good agreement
with the XRD results.

Figure 2 TEM and HRTEM images of WC3 (a, b) and WxC3 (c, d) samples.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images are provided in Figure 3 to investigate the
chemical states of W, O, C, and N atoms. Figure 3a shows the XPS C 1s spectra of the pure
WO3, WxC3, and g-C3N4 samples. For all samples, the peaks centered at 284.8
eV are ascribed to the surface adsorbed C atoms that can be used for
calibration.25 For the g-C3N4 sample, in addition to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV, a new peak
at approximately 288.1 eV is detected, corresponding to the C atoms
in −N–C–N– coordination for g-C3N4. For WxC3 samples, a weak
peak centered at approximately 288.6 eV is also found, suggesting
the existence of g-C3N4. For the XPS N 1s spectra
(Figure 3b), the major
peaks at approximately 398.7 eV for g-C3N4 and
399.1 eV for WxC3 are ascribed to the
sp2 bonding N atoms in −C=N–C–
structures.26 The small difference for
the C 1s and N 1s spectra of WxC3 and
g-C3N4, respectively, is caused by the heterojunction
between g-C3N4 and WO3. The chemical
interaction between g-C3N4 and WO3–x, such as the Mo–N bonding, improves the electron
transfer process in the WxC3 heterojunction.
For the XPS W 4f spectrum (Figure 3c), the double peaks at approximately 35.9 and 38.1
eV are attributed to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of W6+ ions in WO3, respectively.6,7 Moreover, two different valence states of W ions can be observed
for WxC3 samples. In addition to the peaks
of W6+ ions, the new double peak at 35.5 and 37.7 eV can
be observed, ascribed to the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of W5+ ions, respectively.19,23 The existence
of W5+ is usually considered as a direct evidence for the
existence of oxygen vacancies in the WO3 system.18,19 The XPS O 1s spectra of WO3 and WxC3 are deconvoluted into two peaks, as shown in Figure 3d. One peak at 530.9
eV is ascribed to the lattice O in WO3, and the other peak
at 531.9 eV is ascribed to the surface adsorbed O species. Compared
to WO3, the XPS O 1s peak for the WxC3 sample shifts to a lower binding energy by 0.1 eV, which
is due to the change of chemical states from W6+ to W5+.27 This XPS analysis confirms
that the oxygen vacancies are successfully introduced into WO3 via the vacuum thermal treatment and the WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterostructure is
formed. Moreover, the peak intensity of the electron spin resonance
(ESR) signal at g = 2.002 increases in WxC3, compared to that in WC3 (Figure S2), which also confirms that oxygen vacancies are
introduced into WO3 nanorods after the vacuum thermal treatment.

Figure 3 XPS C
1s (a), N 1s (b), W 4f (c), and O 1s (d) spectra of WO3, WxC3, and g-C3N4 samples.

To evaluate the photocatalytic
performance of the as-prepared photocatalyst,
the photoreduction of CO2 with H2O into CO is
shown in Figure 4.
Both WO3 and g-C3N4 samples exhibit
poor photocatalytic activities, with only 1.11 and 0.92 μmol
of CO detected after 8 h irradiation, respectively, which are almost
the same as the blank experiment (0.49 μmol). The WO3–x samples also exhibit a limited photocatalytic activity
(1.39 μmol). A series of WCX samples all exhibit enhanced photocatalytic
activities. The WC3 sample exhibits the best photocatalytic performance
among all samples (Figure S3). There is
5.17 μmol of CO produced after 8 h irradiation. The photocatalytic
performance is further enhanced for WxC3 samples, and 6.64 μmol CO is detected for 8 h irradiation.
These results suggest that the introduction of oxygen vacancies into
the interface between g-C3N4 and WO3 is an effective method to improve the photocatalytic activity.

activity for reduction of CO2 into CO
of pure g-C3N4, WO3, WO3–x, WxC3, and WxC3 samples under a xenon lamp for 8 h.

Figure 5a shows
the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of g-C3N4, WC3, and WxC3 samples to investigate
the influence of oxygen vacancies at the interface of WO3–x and g-C3N4 on the behaviors
of photogenerated charge carriers. The g-C3N4 sample exhibits the highest emission intensity among all samples,
indicating the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and
holes. After the g-C3N4 is composited with WO3 nanorods (WC3 and WxC3), the
PL intensity is quenched efficiently, suggesting an efficient separation
of charge carriers at the interface of g-C3N4 and WO3. The electrons in the conduction band of WO3 might combine with the holes in highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) levels of g-C3N4, suppressing
the recombination of charge carriers. Furthermore, it is noted that
the PL intensity for WxC3 slightly decreases
compared to that of WC3, implying that the oxygen vacancies in WO3 can further promote the separation of charge carriers. The
electrons in the energy levels of oxygen vacancies might recombine
with the holes in HOMO levels of g-C3N4, further
separating the charge carriers.

Figure 5 Photoluminescence spectra (a) and time-resolved
PL decay curves
(b) for WC3 and WxC3 samples.

Time-resolved PL decay curve is a sensitive and powerful
method
to further study the separation behaviors of charge carriers. As shown
in Figure 5b, the fast
decay lifetime (τ1) is usually related to the nonradiative relaxation
process and the longer decay lifetime (τ2) is related to the
radiative process, arising from the recombination of photogenerated
electrons and holes. The values of τ1 and τ2 for WC3 and
WxC3 are calculated by double exponential
decay fitting. The τ2 value for WxC3 is 6.29 ns, which is much longer than that for WC3 (3.91 ns).
This result suggests that the introduction of oxygen vacancies on
the surface of WO3 can prolong the lifetime of charge carriers
in the WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterojunction. The photogenerated electrons in WO3 would be trapped in the energy levels of oxygen vacancies and further
combine with the holes in HOMO levels of g-C3N4. It becomes difficult for the electrons to stay in the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of g-C3N4 to
recombine with the holes. A similar reason can be applied to the holes
in the valence band of WO3. Therefore, the lifetime of
the charge carriers for WxC3 is prolonged,
which is in favor of the photocatalytic performance eventually.

Moreover, the photocurrent responses of WC3 and WxC3 are illustrated in Figure S4. The photocurrent densities for WxC3
are much higher than those of WC3, which is in good agreement with
the photocatalytic results. This observation confirms that the introduction
of the oxygen vacancies on the surface of WO3 can enhance
the visible-light response and facilitate the separation of charge
carriers of the WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterojunction. The detailed photocatalytic mechanism
will be discussed in the following section.

The diffuse reflectance
UV–visible (UV–vis) absorption
spectra of g-C3N4, WO3, WO3–x, and WxC3 nanorods are
plotted in Figure 6a. Pure WO3 samples show strong absorption in the UV light
region and also exhibit some absorption from 400 to 550 nm. For WO3–x samples, the absorption edge is
almost the same as that of pure WO3, suggesting that the
vacuum thermal treatment can hardly change the band gap of WO3. However, a broad peak from 400 to 800 nm is observed for
WO3–x samples, whose absorption
maximum is at approximately 523 nm. It has been reported that the
oxygen vacancies would induce defect energy levels below the conduction
band of WO3.18,19,28 Thus, the enhancement of visible-light response can be ascribed
to the electron transition from the valence band to energy levels
of oxygen vacancies. On the other hand, g-C3N4 shows a strong absorption, ascribed to the electron transition from
the HOMO levels to the LUMO levels. The maximum of absorption peak
of g-C3N4 is also at approximately 420 nm. After
WO3–x is composited with g-C3N4, a red shift is observed for the absorption
edge and the absorption around 420 nm is enhanced for the WxC3 samples.

Figure 6 (a) Diffuse reflectance UV–vis
absorption spectra and (b)
corresponding Tauc plots of g-C3N4, WO3, WO3–x, and WxC3 samples.

The band gap of semiconductors
can be determined by the following
Tauc equation  where α is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck’s constant, v is
the light frequency, A is the proportionality, and Eg is the band gap. n is 1/2
for direct band gap semiconductors and 2 for indirect band gap semiconductors.
In this work, WO3 is a direct band gap semiconductor and
g-C3N4 is an indirect band gap semiconductor.9−11 Hence, n is 2 for g-C3N4 and
1/2 for WO3. As shown in Figure 6b, the corresponding band gaps of g-C3N4 and WO3 are estimated to be 2.62
and 3.17 eV. The band gap of WO3 in this work is larger
than that from previous reports,10,12,29−31 which may be caused by the ultrathin
diameter of nanorods. After the introduction of oxygen vacancies,
the band gap of WO3–x nanorods
remains as 3.17 eV. The direct band gap for WxC3 is narrowed to 3.05 eV, corresponding to the red shift of the
absorption edge. As the absorption maximum of the tailed peak for
WO3–x samples originating from
oxygen vacancies is around 523 nm, the energy level of oxygen vacancies
is deduced to be approximately 0.8 eV below the conduction band minimum
(CBM) of WO3.

The XPS valence band spectra of WO3, WO3–x, WxC3, and g-C3N4 are plotted
in Figure 7. The valence
band maximum of WO3 is approximately
3.20 eV (+2.80 eV, vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), and the HOMO
level for g-C3N4 is at approximately 2.05 eV
(+1.65 eV, vs NHE). Moreover, the valence bands of WO3–x and WxC3 samples are
almost the same as that of pure WO3. According to the discussion
above, the corresponding band gaps of WO3 and g-C3N4 are estimated to be 3.17 and 2.62 eV. Therefore, the
LUMO levels and the conduction band minimum for g-C3N4 and WO3 are estimated to be at −0.97 and
−0.37 eV (vs NHE), respectively.

Figure 7 XPS valence band spectra
of pure WO3, WO3–x,
WxC3, and g-C3N4.

Based on the discussion above,
the schematic diagram of the band
structure for WO3/g-C3N4 heterostructures
can be plotted in Figure S5. For WO3/g-C3N4 heterostructures, there are
two possible pathways to separate charge carriers, namely, typical
heterostructure pathway and Z-scheme pathway. In the typical heterostructure
pathway, the holes would migrate from the valence band of WO3 to the HOMO levels of g-C3N4; the electrons
in the LUMO levels of g-C3N4 would transfer
to the conduction band of WO3. In the Z-scheme pathway,
the excited electrons in the conduction band of WO3 can
recombine with the holes in the HOMO levels of g-C3N4 directly, leaving the electrons enriched in the LUMO levels
of g-C3N4. As shown in Figure S5, the conduction band minimum of WO3 (−0.37
eV, vs NHE) is less negative than the reduction potential of CO/CO2 (−0.52 eV, vs NHE). As a result, the electrons in
the conduction band of WO3 cannot reduce the CO2 molecules to produce CO effectively. Therefore, it is necessary
for the photoinduced carriers to be separated in the Z-scheme pathway
to reduce CO2 into CO for the WO3/g-C3N4 heterostructures. The generation of hydroxyl radicals •OH can be a strong and direct evidence to confirm that
g-C3N4/WO3 is a direct solid-state
Z-scheme heterostructure.32,33 According to Figure S6, it can be confirmed that the charge
carriers are separated in the Z-scheme way for WO3/g-C3N4 samples in this experiment.

The detailed
improved photocatalytic mechanism of WO3–x/g-C3N4, illustrated in Figure 8, can be explained
as follows. The photocatalytic reduction mechanism of CO2 into CO can be explained by eqs 1–334−38 1   2   3  To achieve efficient
photoreduction of CO2 into CO, the potential of electrons
must be more negative
than the reduction potential (Ered = −0.52
V vs NHE) and the potential of holes must be more positive than the
oxidation potential (Eox = +0.82 V vs
NHE). Although the electrons and holes for g-C3N4 can participate in the reaction directly, the photocatalytic activity
is still limited because of the rapid recombination of charge carriers
(Figure 5a). Both pure
WO3 and WO3–x nanorods
exhibit a poor photocatalytic activity because of the relative low
potential of conduction band minimum, as the photogenerated electrons
can hardly participate in the reaction in eq 2. After WO3–x nanorods are composited with g-C3N4 nanosheets,
the holes in the HOMO levels of g-C3N4 would
combine with the electrons in the conduction band of WO3–x, separating the carriers efficiently in the Z-scheme
pathway. As the LUMO levels of g-C3N4 and the
valence band maximum of WO3 match the redox potential of
CO2 reduction (eqs 1–3), photogenerated carriers
could react with the surface adsorbed CO2 molecules to
participate in the photoreduction reaction. It is noted that the photocatalytic
activity can be further enhanced for WO3–x/g-C3N4 samples by introducing the oxygen
vacancies into the WO3 surface. The energy levels of the
oxygen vacancies locate at approximately 0.8 eV below the CBM of WO3–x. The electrons can be excited from
the valence band to the energy levels of oxygen vacancies directly.
The electrons in the conduction band of WO3–x would also be trapped by the energy levels of oxygen vacancies.
As the energy levels of oxygen vacancies are close to the HOMO levels
of g-C3N4, the electrons in the energy levels
of oxygen vacancies can combine with holes in the HOMO levels of g-C3N4 more easily, promoting the separation of photogenerated
electrons and holes in the Z-scheme pathway. The holes left in the
valence band of WO3–x can oxidize
the H2O into H+ (eq 2), and the electrons left in the LUMO levels
of g-C3N4 can react with CO2 and
H+ to yield CO and H2O (eq 3). Therefore, the oxygen vacancies at the
interface of WO3–x and g-C3N4 could extend the visible-light response, facilitate
the separation of charge carriers in the Z-scheme pathway, and prolong
the lifetime of electrons and holes, resulting in a significantly
enhanced photocatalytic activity on the reduction of CO2 into CO.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have constructed oxygen vacancy-modified Z-scheme
heterostructures by compositing WO3–x nanorods with g-C3N4 nanosheets. The
photocatalytic activity on the photoreduction of CO2 into
CO is remarkably enhanced for WxC3 samples
(WO3–x nanorods composited with
3 wt % of g-C3N4), compared to WO3, g-C3N4, and WC3 samples. It is revealed that
the introduced oxygen vacancies result in defect energy levels below
the conduction band of WO3–x, which
extend the visible-light response, promote the separation of charge
carriers in the Z-scheme, and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated
electrons. This work may provide physical insights for designing and
fabricating oxygen vacancy-modified novel heterostructures with highly
efficient performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of WO3–x/g-C3N4
WO3 nanorods
were synthesized via the typical hydrothermal method: 3 mL of concentrated
hydrochloric acid (12 mol/L) and 3.3 g of Na2WO4·H2O were added into 70 mL of deionized water (18.2
MΩ·cm) and a yellow floc formed immediately. This mixture
was added with 20 g of K2SO4 and then transferred
into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 180 °C
for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained participates
were washed with deionized water six times and then dried at 60 °C
for 10 h. The WO3–x nanorods with
oxygen vacancies were prepared by vacuum thermal treatment. WO3 powders (0.3 g) were placed in an electric vacuum drying
oven. The vacuum pressure was 5–20 mTorr, and the temperature
was elevated to 200 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. After
vacuum thermal treatment for 5 h, the powders were placed in air and
allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally and were labeled
as WO3–x. The g-C3N4 was prepared by directly calcining 20 g of urea in muffle
with a heating rate of 2.5 °C min–1 and then
kept at 550 °C for 3 h.

The WO3–x/g-C3N4 heterostructures were prepared
as follows: WO3–x powders (0.2
g) were dispersed into 50 mL of deionized water and ultrasonicated
in 40 KHz for 3 h, which was designated as sample A. At the same time,
g-C3N4 powders (6 mg) were dispersed in 50 mL
of 0.02 mol/L hydrochloric acid and ultrasonicated in 40 kHz for 3
h, which was designated as sample B. Sample A was mixed with sample
B under vigorous stirring for 12 h and dried in an oven for 10 h.
The obtained powders were designated as WxCX, where X% indicated the nominal weight ratio
of g-C3N4 to WO3–x. Similarly, WO3/g-C3N4 was
also prepared by the same procedure just by replacing the WO3–x powders with the WO3 powders. The obtained
samples were designated as WC3 (0.2 g of WO3 and 6 mg of
g-C3N4).

4.2 Characterization
XRD patterns were
collected on a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffraction spectrometer (Cu
Kα, λ = 1.54056 Å). HRTEM images were obtained by
a JEOL 3010, for which the samples were prepared by applying a drop
of ethanol suspension onto an amorphous carbon-coated copper grid
and dried naturally. XPS measurements were carried out with a VG Scientific
ESCA Lab 250i-XL spectrometer by using an unmonochromated Al Kα
(1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All of the XPS images were calibrated with
respect to the binding energy of the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8
eV. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded
on a UV–vis spectrometer (U-4100, Hitachi). PL spectra were
measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments,
FLS920) using the 340 nm line of a Xe light as the excitation source.
The ESR spectra were measured on a Bruker a300 spectrometer at room
temperature in air. The time-resolved PL decay curves were measured
on FLS 980 (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS920) excited at 340 nm and monitored
at 450 nm.

4.3 Evaluation of Photocatalytic
Activity
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into
carbon oxide (CO) was performed in a sealed 275 mL Pyrex glass reactor.
Photocatalysts (100 mg) were uniformly dispersed on the round bottom
of the reactor (about 18 cm2). This reactor was inflated
with CO2 gas (99.999%) at a flux of 0.3 L/min for 45 min
consistently to exclude other gases (for example, N2 and
O2). Then, 0.4 mL of deionized water was injected into
the reactor. The whole reactor was sealed and placed at 27 cm right
below a 500W Xe lamp. At 2 h intervals, 0.4 mL of gas was extracted
to detect the amount of yield CO by a gas chromatograph (GC 2010 plus,
SHIMADZU).
