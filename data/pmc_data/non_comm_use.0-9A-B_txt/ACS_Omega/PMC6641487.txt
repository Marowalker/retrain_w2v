The
stability and performance of supercapacitor devices are limited
by the diffusion-controlled redox process occurring at materials’
surfaces. Phosphate-based metal oxides could be effectively used as
pseudocapacitors because of their polar nature. However, electrochemical
energy storage applications of Mn–Co-based phosphate materials
and their related kinetics studies have been rarely reported. In this
work, we have reported a morphology-tuned MnxCo3–x(PO4)2·8H2O (MCP) spinel compound synthesized by
a one-step hydrothermal method. Detailed physical and chemical insights
of the active material coated on the nickel substrate are examined
by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy,
field-emission transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Physiochemical studies
reveal that the well-defined redox behavior usually observed in Co2+/Ni2+ surface-terminated compounds is suppressed
by reducing the divalent cation density with an increased Co3+ and Mn3+ surface states. A uniform and dense leaflike
morphology observed in the MnCo2 phosphate compound with
an increased surface area enhances the electrochemical energy storage
performance. The high polar nature of P–O bonding formed at
the surface leads to a higher rate of polarization and a very low
relaxation time, resulting in a perfect square-shaped cyclic voltagram
and triangular-shaped galvanostatic charge and discharge curve. We
have achieved a highly pseudocapacitive MCP, and it can be used as
a vital candidate in supercapacitor energy storage applications.

Introduction
Inadequate nonrenewable
energy resources and a huge upsurge in
environmental pollution urges us to find some ultimate clean and efficient
energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCs)
to be used in electric vehicles to replace gasoline fuels. Though
both batteries and SCs rely on the electrochemical process, the charge
storage mechanisms in batteries arise from the intercalation/de-intercalation
of ions (Faradaic process) into bulk cathode materials and are slow
diffusion-controlled charge transfer kinetic processes because of
active mass transport,1,2 whereas in SCs, charge storage
arises from electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), which is a non-Faradaic
process,3,4 because of the polarization of the charges
at the electrode/electrolyte interface, it does not depend on redox
reactions and hence show fast response to the changes in the potential
without any diffusion limitations, and it excel high power outputs;
however, it has low energy density because the charge storage is confined
only at the surface of the electrodes.3−5 Mostly, activated porous
carbon-based materials used as SCs, possess high specific capacitance
because of high surface charge density stored electrostatically and
very short charge separation distance (1 nm) at the electrode/electrolyte
interface and hence show a very high time rate of polarization.6−9 Recently, transition metal oxide-based materials are widely used
as pseudocapacitors, where faradic reactions were accompanied by the
EDLC, resulting in a high charge storage capacity.10−12 A perfect pseudocapacitive
material (e.g., MnO2 and RuO2) gives a triangular
charging/discharging profile and show a rectangular cyclic voltammetry
(CV) behavior.13,14 However, many of these materials
show asymmetry in charging/discharging because of the energy loss
associated with sluggish kinetics and diffusion-controlled transport.15−18 In this respect, phosphate-based metal oxides could be effectively
used as pseudocapacitors because of the polarization originated from
the polar nature of the materials. Even though very few transition
metal phosphates such as Mn3(PO4)2,19 Co3(PO4)2,20 Co3P2O8,21 Ni(PO4),22 and VOPO423 were reported, the presence of redox peaks in the CV sweep and a
plateau in the charging/discharging profile limit their applications.
Usually, Ni(OH)2 and CoO2 mostly show well-separated
oxidation/reduction peaks (Faradaic) in the KOH electrolyte because
of their low redox potential in divalent surface cations, which is
a typical behavior of batteries.19,24−26

Even though manganese phosphate and cobalt phosphate have
been
reported as pseudocapacitive materials, either the CV voltage has
been swept from negative to positive or it shows oxidation/reduction
behaviors.25−27 Hence, it is highly essential to alleviate the redox
behaviors usually observed in metal phosphate-based materials and
understand the electrochemical charge storage mechanisms based on
their kinetics. Trivalent cations have very high redox potential and
could be a solution to solve the above problems, which were not reported
to the best of our knowledge. Here, we have reported a Mn–Co
phosphate spinel compound having trivalent cation-terminated surfaces,
which not only suppressed the redox behaviors but also enhanced the
specific capacitance in the highly ordered hierarchically structured
MnxCo3–x(PO4)2·8H2O (MCP) deposited
on nickel foam (NF) current collectors.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis process of the hierarchically structured MCP is illustrated
in Scheme 1, and the
samples are named as Mn0.5Co2.5, MnCo2, Mn1.5Co1.5, and Mn2Co for x = 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2, respectively. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was performed to know the crystalline phase of the as-prepared
MCP thin films deposited on NF. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared MCP films
with various Mn concentrations such as Mn2Co, Mn1.5Co1.5, MnCo, and Mn0.5Co2.5. The
standard XRD patterns of MCP (ICCD no. 00-041-0375) and Mn3–x(PO4)2·3H2O
(ICCD no. 00-003-0426) were used to match diffracted crystal planes
of the deposited films. The diffraction patterns did not match with
either Mn–PO4 or Co–PO4, but showed
mixtures of both, ensuring the formation of compounds. When the Co
atoms were replaced by Mn atoms in the monoclinic phase of Co3(PO4)2·8H2O, the structural
morphology was rearranged because of the differences in ionic radii,
bond lengths, and enthalpies of formation.28

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation
of the Synthesis Method of the Hierarchically
Structured MCP Thin Films
The formation of hierarchical structures depends on the
ratio of
the Mn/Co atomic concentration. Manganese has ionic radii of 81, 72,
and 67 pm for Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ oxidation states, respectively, whereas cobalt has 79 and 68.5 pm
for Co2+ and Co3+, respectively. To maintain
charge neutrality, there are only two possible rearrangements between
the ionic charge states of Mn2+/Co2+ and Mn3+/Co3+. XRD reveals that the crystallinity is very
high for Mn2Co (reduced cobalt concentration) and shows
a monoclinic cobalt phosphate structure with increasing cobalt concentration
(Mn0.5Co2.5). Figure 2 shows the field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the as-prepared (a) Mn2Co,
(b) Mn1.5Co, (c) MnCo, and (d) Mn0.5Co phosphates.
The hierarchically structured MCP thin films were well-grown on the
surface of NF because NF itself acts as nucleation sites for the growth
of nanostructures.26

as-prepared (a) Mn0.5Co2.5, (b) MnCo2, (c) Mn1.5Co1.5, and
(d) Mn2Co phosphates.

When the Mn concentration was very low (Mn0.5Co1.5), flowerlike nanostructures were formed and the flower
density was increased in MnCo2. With further increase in
the Mn atomic ratio, the flower nanostructures were diminished and
hexagon structures progressively increased. It is because that the
Mn–(PO4) phase usually possesses a sheet or 3D structures
and the Co–(PO4) phase possesses nanoflower structures.20,21 The structural formation was uniform and denser leaflike structures
were formed for the MnCo2 compound. Moreover, the nanoflower
structures were transformed to hexagons and formed thicker crystals
having a less surface area and a high crystalline nature in the Mn2Co compound, as shown in Figure 2d. This clearly evidences the transformation
of the phase and morphology from one motif to another motif and supports
our XRD measurement. The elemental compositions of MCP@NF hierarchal
structures were examined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping
and are shown in the Supporting Information Figure S1 for the best performing (a) MnCo2 and (b) Mn1.5Co1.5 thin films.

The EDX surface mapping
spectrum clearly illustrates the homogeneous
distribution of Mn, Co, O, and P elements on NF. Even though nickel
composition was very low compared to Mn, Co, and P, the intensity
and distribution indicate the oxidation of nickel; otherwise, nickel
would not be present on the surface of the films. Moreover, the elemental
mapping images reveal that the surface of the nanostructures contains
mostly O and P elements. The nanoscale structures were analyzed by
FE-TEM and are shown in Figure 3a (Mn0.5Co2.5) and 3d (Mn2Co). It reveals that the hexagons were grown over flower structures.
The high-magnification images and SAED patterns are given in Figure 3b,c (Mn0.5Co2.5) and Figure 3e,f (Mn2Co). The interatomic distances were calculated
from TEM-SAED and compared with the XRD data. The interatomic distances
of Mn2Co along the (1 3 0) plane have been found to be
0.405, 0.407, and 0.412 nm from XRD, TEM, and TEM-SAED measurements,
respectively. The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(HR-XPS) studies were conducted to investigate the influence of Mn/Co
atomic ratios on the surface binding oxidation states and the elemental
composition of hierarchal MCP@NF. The HR-XPS spectra were fitted with
Gaussian–Lorentzian (30% Gaussian) functions and a Shirley-type
background and are shown in Figure 4a,b for Mn 2p and Co 2p, respectively.

Mn was deconvoluted into three
oxidation states: Mn2+ (640.6 eV), Mn3+ (642.7
eV), and Mn4+ (646.2
eV),29,30 showing the presence of a mixed valence
state on the surface of the nanostructures. It is very interesting
to note that the amount of the Mn4+ state was reduced with
increasing the Mn content, and Mn3+ is maximum for MnCo2. Likewise, the Co 2p3/2 peak was deconvoluted
into two different oxidation states: Co2+ (779 eV) and
Co3+ (781.3 eV), and the two satellites peaks were located
at 784.3 and 786.7 eV.31 The amount of
the Co2+ state was not affected by the Mn/Co ratio, whereas
Co3+ is maximum for MnCo2 and reduced for both
Mn2Co and Mn0.5Co2.5. It implies
that the Mn3+/Co3+ charge state decides the
electrochemical performance because the Co3+ charge density
increases the electronic conductivity. The core-level spectra of P
2p were deconvoluted in two peaks by fixing the spin-orbital splitting
at 0.87 eV and area ratio at 2:1 between 2p3/2/2p1/2, and the full width at half maximum was fixed for same oxidation
states and is illustrated in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 High-resolution core-level XPS spectra of (a) P 2p and
(b) Ni 2p.

The deconvoluted peaks located
at 132.4, 134.1, and 135.25 eV were
respectively assigned to the phosphates corresponding to (PO4)3–, (PO3)−, and P2O5.32 The P2O5 peak is observed only for MnCo2, and the
(PO4)3– amount was not affected by the
Mn/Co ratio. Moreover, the Ni 2p spectra given in Figure 5b confirm the oxidation of
the nickel metal substrate, and the Ni 2p3/2 peak of core-level
spectra was deconvoluted into two peaks such as Ni2+ (854.9
eV) and Ni3+ (857.7 eV), respectively, and the two satellite
peaks at 860.5 and 863 correspond to the vacancy of NiO (Ni2+) and NiOOH (Ni3+), respectively.27 It clearly shows that the amounts of Ni3+, Mn3+, and Co3+ are maximum for MnCo2. Moreover,
the cation charge state of X3+ (X = Mn, Co, and Ni) is
vital to decide the electrochemical performance by enhancing the anion
absorption at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and increasing
Co3+/Ni3+ amounts usually increase the redox
potential and conductivity of the active material.

Prior to
fabricating the symmetric cells, single-electrode performances
were tested using the SP-150 electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode
configuration with the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference
electrode. Figure 6 illustrates the performance of the half-cell prepared from hierarchal
MCP@NF electrodes. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD)
for various Mn/Co ratios is given in Figure 6a at 2 A/g current rate, and Figure 6b shows the best performing
MnCo2 phosphates at various current densities. The nonlinear
(not triangular) plateau in the voltage versus time sweep shows the
pseudocapacitive property of MCP, which mostly occur where there is
a resistive loss. The specific capacitance values were calculated
from the GCD curves using the formula given below:33 1  where C is the gravimetric
capacitance, q is the charge, V is
the voltage, dt is the discharge time, and m is the
mass of the active material.

Figure 6 (a) Charge–discharge behavior of single
electrodes at the
2 A/g current rate, (b) MnCo2 compound at various current
densities, (c) Nyquist plots, and (d) gravimetric specific capacitance
as a function of current densities.

Double-layer capacitance mainly depends on three parameters
such
as the electrode surface area, electrolyte composition, and potential
field between the charges at the interface.2 All the studies were done with the best ion donating electrolyte
(KOH), which is a very effective aqueous electrolyte because of its
wide operating window up to 1.4 V and can readily give solvated ions
when dissolved in an aqueous medium. The rate of polarization is decided
by the surface charges present at the electrode/electrolyte interface.
The compound MnCo2 has a higher specific capacitance value
of 979.91 F/g at a current rate of 2 A/g and maintains a high value
of 566.7 F/g at 6 A/g. As we have seen from the morphological studies,
it has the highest surface area and vertically arranged leaves over
the conductive NF. At a current rate of 2 A/g, the specific capacitances
were 593.7 F/g, 765.4, and 485 F/g for Mn0.5Co2.5, Mn1.5Co1.5, and Mn2Co, respectively.
Both Mn0.5Co2.5 and Mn2Co have a
large size crystal and a lesser surface area, and the electrostatic
active sites for possible polarization were minimal and lead to a
poor performance. The multilayered structure in the Mn2Co compound has the surface screening effect and the conductivity
could be very low. Moreover, MnCo2 and Mn1.5Co1.5 compounds have increased Co3+ and Mn3+ states, which contribute more electrochemical interconversions
and results in high electrochemical capacitive contribution. In addition,
the redox behaviors usually observed in Ni and Co oxides are suppressed
by the trivalent cationic effects because of high redox potential.
The charge transfer kinetics was studied by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS). Figure 6c shows the EIS of MCP@NF. The equivalent series resistances
(Rs), determined from the high-frequency
real part of the impedance intercept, were 0.53, 0.99, 0.98, and 1.63
Ω for Mn0.5Co2.5, MnCo2, Mn1.5Co1.5, and Mn2Co, respectively.34−37 The charge transfer resistances (Rct) calculated from the Nyquist plots were 0.09, 0.08, 0.04, and 0.13
Ω for Mn0.5Co2.5, MnCo2, Mn1.5Co1.5, and Mn2Co, respectively. Both
MnCo2 and Mn1.5Co1.5 compounds have
nearly equal electron spin resonance (ESR), showing a conventional
EIS behavior of a pseudocapacitive material.34 Mn1.5Co1.5 and MnCo2 have low ESR
compared to the reported phosphate-based materials.26,38Figure 6d shows the
current density versus specific capacitance of MCP electrodes. Mn1.5Co1.5 and MnCo2 have higher pseudocapacitance
output and could be used as a better pseudocapacitive material for
SC energy storage applications.

The electrochemical performance
of symmetry cells was carried out
in 3 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. Figure 7a shows the CV curve of symmetric SCs for
different Mn concentrations at 20 mV/s. It can be seen that MnCo2 and Mn1.5Co1.5 have a rectangular shape,
whereas Mn0.5Co2.5 and Mn2Co show
a diffusive behavior. The diffusive behavior mainly arises from Ni2+ and Co2+ because they are not available for the
electrochemical interconversion because of their lower affinity to
attract anions.

mV/s for (a) various Mn/Co ratios and (b,c) at various scan rates
for Mn1.5Co1.5 and MnCo2, respectively.
(d) Nyquist plot and (e,f) galvanostatic charging/discharging at different
current densities for Mn1.5Co1.5 and MnCo2, respectively.

Figure 7b,c
shows
the rectangular shaped CV curve for Mn1.5Co1.5 and MnCo2 at various scan rates, respectively, retaining
the shape even at higher scan rates. The surface binding states play
an important role for the formation of inner and outer Helmholtz layers
at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Because the surface of MnCo2 has more oxidized phosphorus molecules, it is expected that
the electrode/electrolyte interface would form a more polarized ion
layer such as O–H bonds. The EIS measurement shown in Figure 7d is one of the major
evidence, providing the capacitive nature because of small Rs and Rct at the
electrode/electrolyte interface. The inset graph (Figure 7d) shows the impedance in the
high-frequency range with a perfect semicircle, and an almost vertical
line in the low-frequency region represents the Warburg resistance
parallel to the imaginary axis, evidencing the capacitive behavior
of Mn1.5Co1.5 and MnCo2@NF symmetric
SC devices. The measured Rs values were
1.290 and 0.833 Ω and the Rct values
were 0.5 and 3.1 Ω for MnCo2 and Mn1.5Co1.5 compounds, respectively. The charge transfer resistance
was comparatively very low for MnCo2, and hence, it showed
superior electrochemical performance compared to all other compounds.
Symmetric two-electrode MnCo2 performs seamlessly as a
pseudocapacitive material, as evidenced from the EIS measurements,
and could possibly open a new window for pseudocapacitance materials. Figure 7e,f shows the GCD
profile of symmetric SCs assembled for Mn1.5Co1.5 and MnCo2, respectively, exhibiting a linear charging
and discharging profile that again confirms the pseudocapacitive behavior.
Usually, the redox peaks appear where intercalation and de-intercalation
of ions occur at the electrodes, whereas in the SC, the charge storage
mainly depends on the adsorption of electrolyte ions affected by the
chemical affinities of the solvated ions to the electrode surface
and also the field strength of the electric double layer.39 In the pseudocapacitance process, both the formation
of the Helmholtz double layer and fast surface Faradaic process enhance
the capacitance. The formation of a two-dimensional monolayer or quasimonolayer
of electrochemically reactive species causes a reversible process.
Even though the NiO oxidation state is a hindrance to the pseudocapacitive
performance, disappearance of the well-separated redox peaks in our
case ensures the significance of our work.25,40−42 Moreover, the electrical conductivity mainly depends
on the cation valence state and is higher for X3+ (X =
Co and Mn) because of the improved electron transport.43 Hence, the MnCo2 compound with enriched
Co3+ and Mn3+ surface charge density and higher
surface area lead to good performance in pseudocapacitance. The presence
of P2O5 along with the PO4 gives
the possibility of more sites for attracting the solvated protons
(K+) and help the MnCo2 phosphate compound to
perform well in symmetrical SCs.

Conclusions
In
summary, highly ordered MCP was grown on NF current collectors
by a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis. A binder-, polymer-,
and carbon-free approach was used to fabricate the active material
on NF to avoid its effects in pseudocapacitance devices. The morphology
was tuned by controlling the Mn–Co atomic ratios. We have concluded
that MnCo2 compound with a uniform leaflike morphology
and larger surface area could be a better option for the pseudocapacitive
materials. Also, we have found that the oxidation of nickel that occurs
during hydrothermal synthesis hinders the electrochemical performance;
however, this could be avoided with suitable trivalent cation substitution.
Even though NF is a good platform for the growth of nanostructures,
reduction of the nickel metal into NiO and NiOOH leads to the oxidation/reduction
reaction and mass transfer during the electrochemical processes should
be avoided.

Experimental Section
Material Synthesis
All the chemicals
were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Highly ordered
hierarchal MCP nanostructures were grown on conductive NF substrates
of thickness 0.2 mm. The NF was washed using 3 M HCl to remove the
oxides, followed by acetone, ethanol, and finally DI water under ultrasonication
prior to the deposition. An equimolar concentration of ammonium dihydrogen
phosphate (NH4H2PO4), cobalt nitrate
hexahydrate (Co(NO3)·6H2O), and manganese
nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)·4H2O) was
added to 100 mL of DI water, stirred vigorously at room temperature
for 30 min, and then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel
autoclave with the NF kept vertically at 120 °C for 8 h. Finally,
the NF substrates were collected and washed with acetone, ethanol,
and DI water. Four different molar ratios of MCP (x = 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.5) were used to tune the cobalt and manganese
concentration, named respectively, Mn2Co, Mn1.5Co1.5, MnCo, and MnCo2 for ease of identification.

Electrochemical Measurement
For electrochemical measurement,
MCP/NF electrodes were cut into 1 × 1 cm and used as a working
electrode in a standard three-electrode cell configuration with a
platinum wire and SCE was used as counter and reference electrodes.
For a complete cell, symmetrical electrodes of Mn2Co, Mn1.5Co1.5, MnCo, and MnCo2 deposited on
NF were assembled. The electrochemical measurements such as CV, EIS,
and GCD were performed using a BioLogic SP-150 electrochemical workstation
in 3 M KOH alkaline electrolyte.

Material Characterization
The crystal structure was
analyzed using a X-ray diffractometer ( Bruker D-8 ADVANCE) with Cu
Kα operated at 40 kV and 30 mA in the range of 10–70°.
The surface morphologies were analyzed using FE-SEM (Zeiss SUPRA 25)
and FE-TEM (Talos F200X). Surface binding states and elemental compositional
analysis were characterized by XPS using a Thermo Fisher Scientific
(UK) ESCALAB 250 system with monochromatic Al Kα radiation at
1486.6 eV and with an electron take-off angle of 45°. The chamber
pressure was kept at 10–10 Torr during the measurement.
The survey spectrum was scanned in the binding energy (BE) range of
100–1200 eV in scan steps of 1 eV and were calibrated using
a fixed core-level peak of adventitious carbon (C 1s) at 284.6 eV
as a reference. Peak fitting and quantitative analysis were done using
the CasaXPS program (Casa Software Ltd), and the results were justified
using an average matrix relative sensitivity factor with respect to
the peak area and atomic sensitivity factor of the identified components.
We used the lowest possible number of components to fit the data satisfactorily,
and the uncertainty in the BE position was within 0.05 eV for a component.
