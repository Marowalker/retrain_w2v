Switches from Oxoiron(IV) Species to Hydroxyl Radical in Phosphate
Buffer Solutions? A Computational Rationale Chen Hsing-Yin *Department of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan* E-mail: hychen@kmu.edu.tw.13 08 2019 27 08 2019 4 9 14105 14113 02 07 2019 31 07 2019 Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society2019American Chemical SocietyThis is an open access article published under a Creative Commons Non-Commercial No Derivative Works (CC-BY-NC-ND) Attribution License, which permits copying and redistribution of the article, and creation of adaptations, all for non-commercial purposes.

It has been shown
that the major reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generated by the aqueous reaction of Fe(II) and H2O2 (i.e., the Fenton reaction) are high-valent oxoiron(IV) species,
whereas the hydroxyl radical plays a role only in very acidic conditions.
Nevertheless, when the Fenton reaction is conducted in phosphate buffer
solutions, the resulting ROS turns into hydroxyl radical even in neutral
pH conditions. The present density functional theory (DFT) study discloses
the underlying principle for this phenomenon. Static and dynamic DFT
calculations indicate that in phosphate buffer solutions, the iron
ion is highly coordinated by phosphoric acid anions. Such a coordination
environment substantially raises the pKa of coordinated water on Fe(III). As a consequence, the Fe(III)–OH
intermediate, resulting from the reductive decomposition of H2O2 by ferrous ion is relatively unstable and will
be readily protonated by phosphoric acid ligand or by free proton
in solution. These proton-transfer reactions, which become energetically
favorable when the number of phosphate coordination goes up to three,
prevent the Fe(III)–OH from hydrogen abstraction by nascent •OH to form Fe(IV)=O species. On the basis of
this finding, a ligand design strategy toward controlling the nature
of ROS produced in the Fenton reaction is put forth. In addition,
it is found that while phosphate buffers facilitate •OH radical generation in the Fenton reaction, phosphoric acid anions
can act as •OH radical scavengers through hydrogen
atom transfer reactions.

1 Introduction
The
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the catalytic
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by ferrous ion is referred to as
the Fenton reaction. The Fenton and Fenton-like reactions are ubiquitous
and have a broad range of applications. For example, they take place
in natural environments and have been considered to be a pathway of
ROS generation in atmospheric clouds1−3 and in aquatic environments
such as river and ocean.4 They also inevitably
occur in the human body and have been thought to have connections
with aging and many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases,5−7 cardiovascular diseases,8,9 and cancers.10−12 In addition, the Fenton and Fenton-like reactions are listed as
advanced oxidation processes that are promising techniques for wastewater
treatment and environmental remediation.13−19 They can also be applied in organic synthesis20−24 and the preparation of graphene quantum dots.25,26 Recently, the application of Fenton chemistry in cancer diagnosis
and therapy has been actively developed.27−34 An appealing strategy for cancer therapy called chemodynamic therapy,
which is defined as in situ treatments using Fenton chemistry to selectively
produce ROS in tumor sites, has been proposed.30,31

The identity of ROS produced in the Fenton reaction has been
a
longstanding dispute.35−42 The mechanism of the Fenton reaction is rather complicated, as it
can be affected by various factors such as the concentration of Fe(II)
and H2O2, the pH condition, the nature of ligand
and buffer, and so on. So far, experimental evidences have demonstrated
that in non-coordinating buffer solutions, the high-valent oxoiron(IV)
species is the major ROS produced by the Fenton reactions under the
conditions of pH > 3, whereas the hydroxyl radical becomes dominant
merely in more acidic conditions.43−46 The preference for the formation
of oxoiron(IV) species has also been supported by density functional
theory (DFT) studies.47−53 The DFT calculations further pointed out that the oxoiron(IV) aqua
complexes can exist in three protonation states, [(H2O)5FeIVO]2+, [(H2O)4FeIVO(OH)]+, and [(H2O)3FeIVO(OH)2], depending on the pH conditions.
The oxidizing power of the oxo group in these complexes was found
to be quite dissimilar and principally determined by the total charge
of complexes.53 On the other hand, when
the Fenton reaction is performed in coordinating phosphate buffer
solutions, the resulting ROS switches to •OH radical
even in a neutral pH for some unknown reason.44

The capability of controlling the formation of hydroxyl radical
or oxoiron(IV) species in the Fenton reaction is of importance, as
these two reactive species have their own applications. The hydroxyl
radical is powerful but nonselective and thus suitable for applications,
such as wastewater treatment, while the oxoiron(IV) species is more
selective and can be exploited in catalytic synthesis such as C–H
bond activation and epoxidation. Furthermore, phosphate buffer is
one of the most commonly used buffer systems. The knowledge of how
phosphate buffer influences the property and the reaction behavior
of transition-metal ions is essential to the correct interpretation
of the experimental results. Unfortunately, the relevant knowledge
is very limited and even the nature of the coordination sphere of
metal ions in phosphate buffers is not clear. This inspired me to
conduct the DFT study aiming to determine the coordination sphere
of ferrous iron in phosphate-buffered solution and to disclose how
such a coordination environment alters the mechanism of the Fenton
reaction.

2 Computational Methods
All the DFT calculations
were achieved by using Gaussian 0954 and
Gaussian 16 program.55 Geometry optimization
and vibrational frequency calculations
were carried out in an aqueous environment described by the conductor-like
polarizable continuum model (CPCM).56,57 Grimme’s
D3 dispersion correction58 was added to
improve the description of noncovalent interactions. To ensure that
the wave functions obtained are lowest-energy solutions, the calculation
of wave function stability test was followed for each stationary point.
The thermal correction to the Gibbs free energy was made at standard
conditions of 298.15 K and 55.5 M for H2O and 1 M for the
remaining species. The setting of ultrafine grids was employed for
numerical integrations.

2.1 Ligand-Exchange Reaction
The free
energy changes of stepwise displacement of H2O by H2PO4– from [FeII(H2O)6]2+ were calculated to determine
the component of ferrous complex in phosphate buffer solution. The
accuracy of these computations largely depends on the performance
of the DFT method in describing the metal–ligand bonding interactions
and the performance of the continuum solvation model in estimating
the hydration energies of species involved. To select a proper DFT
method, the gas-phase energy change of a simplified ligand exchange
reaction, [FeIIH2O]2+ + H2PO4– → [FeIIH2PO4]+ + H2O, was calculated
by some widely used exchange-correlation functionals (B3LYP59−61-D3, PBE062-D3, M0663-D3, PW6B9564-D3) in combination
with 6-31+G(d) basis set. Among these functionals, the result of PW6B95-D3
most closely matches the reference value derived from the Brueckner
coupled cluster BD(T)/Def2-TZVPP calculations (rows 2–5 in Table S1). The effect of the basis set was also
examined using the PW6B95-D3 functional, and it turned out that increasing
the size of the basis set did not improve the result (rows 5–7
in Table S1). Regarding the continuum solvation
model, three popular methods (integral equation formalism polarizable
continuum model—IEFPCM,65 CPCM,56,57 solvent model density—SMD66) were
tested by calculating the hydration energies of H2O and
H2PO4– for which the experimental
values are available. The results show that the solvent model density
(SMD) method overestimates the hydration energies of H2O and H2PO4– by 3 and 9 kcal/mol,
respectively (Table S2). This is probably
because the SMD method was parameterized using gas-phase-optimized
geometries rather than aqueous-phase-optimized geometries adopted
in the present study. By contrast, integral equation formalism polarizable
continuum model (IEFPCM) and CPCM methods offer reasonable hydration
energies of both species when aqueous-phase geometries are used. On
the basis of these benchmark studies, CPCM/PW6B95-D3/6-31+G(d) method
was selected to investigate the ligand-exchange reactions of ferrous
complexes.

2.2 Quantum Molecular Dynamics
DFT molecular
dynamics simulations were carried out using the atom-centered density
matrix propagation (ADMP) approach.67−69 The temperature of the
ADMP simulations was kept at 300 K by velocity scaling at every 10
steps. The number of steps in each simulation is 10 000, with
the step size of 0.1 fs. The fictitious electronic mass was set to
0.1 amu. Molecular coordinates were collected at 20-step intervals
for analysis.

2.3 Fenton Reaction and pKa Estimation
The CPCM/PBE0-D3/6-31+G(d)
method was
used to study the mechanism of Fenton reactions. Our previous benchmark
study has verified that this level of theory can nicely reproduce
the Brueckner coupled cluster BD(T)/Def2-TZVP results for the relative
energies of key Fenton intermediates.53 The pKa values of coordinated H2O of the iron complexes were evaluated by using the linear
equation: pKa = 0.20847ΔGdeprot – 47.59790, where ΔGdeprot is the deprotonation free energy, G(A–) – G(HA),
computed by the CPCM/PBE0-D3/6-31+G(d) method. This equation has been
demonstrated to be robust for predicting the pKa of the aqua complexes of the first-row transition-metal ions
with the error being within 0.6 pKa unit.53

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Coordination Sphere of Fe(II)
Phosphoric
acid is a polyprotic acid with three pKa of 2.15, 7.20, and 12.32, respectively. For the sake of simplicity,
here only the existence of dihydrogen phosphate ion was considered,
which corresponds to the condition of pH ∼ 5. To determine
the coordination sphere of Fe(II) in pH 5 phosphate buffer solution,
the free energy changes of successive replacements of H2O by H2PO4– for [FeII(H2O)6]2+ were evaluated by the
CPCM/PW6B95-D3/6-31+G(d) method (Table 1). Other combinations of DFT functionals, solvation
models, and basis sets were also applied to compute the ligand-exchange
energies (Table S3). These calculations
consistently reveal that all the six ligand-exchange processes are
exergonic. However, it should be bore in mind that these reaction
free energies were derived from the calculations with the standard
state concentrations of 55.5 M for H2O and 1 M for the
remaining species. In realistic experiments, the typical concentrations
of Fe(II) and phosphate buffer are 1 and 10 mM, respectively.44 Using these experimental concentrations and
the equilibrium constants derived from the CPCM/PW6B95-D3/6-31+G(d)
free energies, the percentage formation of each [FeII(H2PO4)n(H2O)6–n]2–n complex in realistic conditions was estimated. It turned out
that the major form of ferrous ions in the phosphate buffers of pH
5 is [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]3–, with the percentage being ca. 90%
(Table 1). The optimized
structure of [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]3– is depicted in Figure 1. It can be seen that the [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]3– complex maintains a distorted octahedral geometry.
Notably, numerous hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) are formed between H2PO4– ligands and between H2PO4– and H2O ligands
in this structure (denoted by dotted line and label HB in Figure 1). These interligand
H-bonding interactions are expected to partially relieve the electrostatic
repulsion between the anionic ligands and thus provide a stabilization
for the highly negatively charged six-coordinate complex.

DFT molecular dynamics
simulations with the CPCM/PW6B95-D3/6-31G(d)
method at T = 300 K were carried out to see if [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]3– is still stable when thermal fluctuations are taken
into account. Figure 2 represents the time evolution of the metal–ligand bond distances
for the simulation starting from the optimized geometry. The results
showed that all the six Fe(II)–ligand bond lengths displayed
an oscillating behavior and no sign of ligand dissociation was observed
within a 1 ps simulation. The average value and the standard deviation
of the metal–ligand bond distances are summarized in Table S4. As can be seen, the Fe(II)–water
bond (FeL1) exhibits a larger bond distance and fluctuation
compared to the Fe(II)–phosphate bonds (FeL2–6), reflecting the fact that the bonding between Fe(II) and H2O is weaker. Furthermore, the fluctuation of H-bonds between
ligands was found to be relatively large, especially those involving
H2O. Figure 3 clearly indicates that the H-bonds between water and phosphate ligands
(HB1–3) are more fragile than the H-bonds between
phosphate ligands (HB4–9); this can also be seen
from the bond length data summarized in Table S4, which shows that in general the average bond distance and
the deviation of HB4–9 are smaller than those of
HB1–3. In fact, the H-bonds between the phosphate
ligands are relatively robust and should play a role in stabilizing
the structure of [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]3–.

label.

Since the computational cost of
ADMP dynamics simulations with
hybrid functionals is expensive, especially for the open-shell systems
like the ferrous ion complex investigated in this work, a longer simulation
is not allowed with current computing facilities in our laboratory.
Instead, another two 1 ps ADMP dynamics simulations of [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]3–, starting from different initial geometries and kinetic energies,
were carried out (Figures S1 and S2). In
general, the dynamic behaviors of Fe(II)–phosphate bonds and
H-bonds between ligands in the three trajectories are similar. In
all simulations, the Fe(II)–phosphate bonds vibrated with a
moderate amplitude and were never actually broken. However, the dissociation
of water ligand was detected in one of the trajectories (FeL1 in Figure S2). This, in turn, leaves
an open site for subsequent catalytic reaction with hydrogen peroxide.

One would think that a total charge of −3 for the ferrous
complex with five phosphoric acid ligands is very unlikely. Notwithstanding,
there are indeed few examples of highly negatively charged ferrous
complex in literature, let us recall a well-known case of ferrocyanide
[FeII(CN)6]4–. While this
complex bears a total charge of −4 with six anionic cyanide
ligands, it is very stable and not to release free cyanide in aqueous
solution.

3.2 Fenton Reaction of [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O2)]3–
In light of the foregoing results, the Fenton
reaction in pH 5 phosphate buffer was assumed to be initiated by the
reaction of [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]3– with H2O2, leading to the formation of the reactant complex [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O2)]3–. Figure 4 represents the free energy profile for the Fenton
reaction calculated by the CPCM/PBE0-D3/6-31+G(d) method. This level
of theory has been shown to be faithful in predicting the relative
energies of the two critical intermediates in the Fenton reaction,
namely the hydroxyl radical and the oxoiron(IV) species.53 In addition, the reaction was calculated at
a high-spin quintet state (S = 2), which has been
manifested to be the ground state for the aqueous Fenton reaction.43,47,52 In fact, all the intermediates
shown in Figure 4 have
been reoptimized at singlet and triplet states. The results showed
that these low-spin intermediates were substantially higher than the
quintet state counterparts by 13–43 kcal/mol, indicating that
the phosphate coordination does not cause the reversal of the spin
states for the Fenton reaction.

for the Fenton reaction in
phosphate buffer (L = H2PO4– and L′ = HPO42–). The gray line represents the result in nonbuffered
aqueous solution, namely, the [FeII(H2O)5(H2O2)]2+ model.

Starting from the reactant complex [FeII(H2PO4)5(H2O2)]3– (RC), the subsequent step is the homolysis
of the HO–OH
bond to generate the ferric intermediate [FeIII(H2PO4)5(OH)]3–/•OH (INT1OH/•OH) via the
transition state TSOO. This process
is characterized by an activation energy of 11.8 kcal/mol and slightly
exergonic by 0.6 kcal/mol. Through the rotation of the OH groups,
this ferric intermediate is transformed into a more stable conformation, INT2OH/•OH, in which the OH
group of a phosphoric acid ligand acts as a H-bond donor to stabilize
the hydroxide group on Fe(III) (Figures 4 and 5). This H-bond
is fairly strong with the OH···–OH
distance being 1.46 Å, rendering INT2OH/•OH lower in energy than INT1OH/•OH by 7.4 kcal/mol. From INT2OH/•OH there are two possible
reaction pathways. The nascent •OH radical could
attack and abstract the hydrogen atom of the hydroxide group on Fe(III)
to generate the ferryl-oxo intermediate [FeIV(H2PO4)5(O)]3–/H2O (INToxo) via the transition
state TSoxo (blue path in Figure 4). The activation
energy of this step is 7.7 kcal/mol, and the formation of INToxo is exergonic by 8.4 kcal/mol. Alternatively,
the hydroxide group on Fe(III) can be immediately protonated by the
phosphoric acid ligand via the transition state TSPT,70 resulting in
the formation of the ferric iron complex of [FeIII(H2PO4)4(HPO4)(H2O)]3– and •OH, INTFeIII+•OH (red path in Figure 4). This interligand proton
transfer is barrier-free and the formation of INTFeIII+•OH is exergonic by 12.8 kcal/mol
and, therefore, is more favorable than the formation of INToxo in terms of both kinetics and thermodynamics.
The further dissociation of •OH from INTFeIII+•OH was found to be slightly
exergonic by 1 kcal/mol. These results rationalize the experimental
observation that the major Fenton oxidant in phosphate buffers is
hydroxyl radical rather than ferryl-oxo species. Recently, a similar
effect of phosphate buffer has been reported for hydrogen evolution
catalyzed by Co(II) and Fe(II) complexes. In that computational study,
the authors demonstrated that the coordinated phosphoric acid assists
the production of H2 by delivering proton to metal hydride.71

lengths
for the intermediates and transition states in the Fenton reaction.

It should be mentioned that the electronic potential
energy surface
along the reaction coordinate of the interligand proton transfer is
quite flat. As a consequence, although the TSPT was indeed a transition state on the electronic potential
energy surface, it became lower in energy than its precursory intermediate INT2OH/•OH upon zero-point
energy and free energy corrections. To provide a more solid evidence
that the interligand proton transfer can be considered as a barrierless
process under thermal fluctuations, ADMP dynamics simulation with
the CPCM/PBE0-D3/6-31G(d) method was carried out for [FeIII(H2PO4)5(OH)]3– starting from the optimized geometry. The simulation revealed that
the proton transfer from H2PO4– to HO– immediately occurred at 0.15 ps (Figure 6), supporting the
statement that the process is barrierless.

Figure 6 Time evolution of H-bond
distances for [FeIII(H2PO4)5(OH)]3–.

For comparison, the results of the Fenton reaction in nonbuffered
solutions starting from [FeII(H2O)5(H2O2)]2+ are also illustrated in Figure 4 (gray line). In
general, the coordination of H2PO4– to iron was found to facilitate the Fenton reaction by systematically
lowering the energies of the transition states and the intermediates
along the reaction coordinate. This can be attributed to the stronger
bonding between H2PO4– and
iron in the Fe(III) and Fe(IV) intermediates than in the Fe(II) reactant
complex. A closer look further reveals that the H2PO4– coordination provides a somewhat larger
stabilization for the Fe(III) intermediate (decreasing from 8.8 to
−0.6 kcal/mol for INT1OH/•OH) than for the Fe(IV) intermediate (decreasing from −3.3
to −8.4 kcal/mol for INToxo). It should be bore in mind that although the oxidation state of
iron in ferryl-oxo species is conventionally assigned as +4, the strong
covalent character of Fe(IV)=O bond72 makes the actual charge of iron in the ferryl-oxo intermediate substantially
less positive than that in the ferric intermediate. This is evidenced
by the natural population analysis (NPA) showing that the atomic charge
of iron is 1.367 and 1.102 au in INT1OH/•OH and INToxo, respectively.
As a consequence, the bonding between the iron and phosphoric acid
anions should be somewhat stronger in the former than in the latter.

3.3 pKa Variation
with the Number of H2PO4– Coordination
At first glance, it seems surprising that the proton transfer from
H2PO4– to Fe(III)–OH
(i.e., INT2OH/•OH → INTFeIII+•OH) is thermodynamically
favorable, if one considers the fact that the H2PO4– (pKa = 7.2)
is considerably less acidic than the coordinate water of [FeIII(H2O)6]3+ (pKa = 2.2). Since the proton-transfer step plays a critical role
in prohibiting the Fe(IV)=O formation, detailed analysis on
how the pKa of the coordinated H2O in [FeIII(H2PO4)n(H2O)6–n](3–n) varies with the number
of H2PO4– coordination, n, was carried out. The results show that the pKa of the coordinated water monotonically increases from
2.2 to 7.5 until n = 3, then becomes slow, and reaches
8.9 at n = 5 (Table 2). The enhancement of pKa upon H2PO4– coordination
is caused by two factors. One is the electron transfer from H2PO4– to the metal center, which,
in turn, increases the electron density on iron and thus reduces the
acidity of the coordinated water. This effect can be seen at the n = 0–3 region, where the atomic charge on Fe decreases
from 1.449 to 1.370 au. The other factor is the electrostatic repulsion
between the resulting hydroxide anion and H2PO4– ligands that increases the deprotonation energy
and hence the pKa of coordinated water.
This electrostatic effect is expected to be augmented with the number
of H2PO4– ligand and is responsible
for the increase in pKa at the n = 3–5 region in which the ligand-to-metal electron
transfer is saturated (Table 2). The influence of the H2PO4– ligand on the acidity of Fe(III) is relatively moderate in comparison
to that of the OH– ligand. This can be evidenced
by the fact that the first pKa increment
caused by the H2PO4– substitution
is 2.1 (n = 0 → 1 in Table 2), substantially smaller than the pKa increment of 4.1 caused by the OH– substitution derived from the experimental pKa1 = 2.2 and pKa2 = 6.3 for [FeIII(H2O)6]3+.

It is worth noting that the
pKa of
the coordinated water becomes larger than that of H2PO4– at n ≥ 3, implying
that the interligand proton transfer from H2PO4– to Fe(III)–OH will turn into a spontaneous
process at this point. To verify this prediction, the evolution of
the energy for the proton-transfer reaction with n was calculated as well. It can be seen that both the activation
and the reaction free energies of the proton transfer reaction decrease
with increasing n and the reaction turns into barrier-free
and exergonic at n ≥3, in harmony with the
variation of pKa (Table 2). Moreover, the pKa data in Table 2 implies that the hydroxide group of INT2OH/•OH can also be protonated by the proton in
the aqueous solution to form the [FeIII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]2– and •OH radicals, which serve as an alternative route to
block the formation of INToxo. The free energy of this protonation process is dependent on the
pH value of the solution and can be estimated by the linear equation:
ΔGprot = RT ln10
(pH – pKa).73 Taking the values of pH = 5 and T = 298.15
K, which are the simulated conditions here, and the pKa = 8.9 for [FeIII(H2PO4)5(H2O)]2– (Table 2), the protonation of INT2OH/•OH by the aqueous proton
was calculated to be exergonic by 5.3 kcal/mol, comparable to the
interligand proton transfer, which is exergonic by 4.8 kcal/mol (Figure 4), in thermodynamics.

3.4 •OH Radical Quenching by
H2PO4– and HPO42–
The effect of buffer solutions on the
generation of •OH radical in the Fenton reaction
has been investigated by spin trapping experiments. It was found that
the generation of •OH was significantly reduced
in coordinating phosphate buffer compared to that in non-coordinating N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid or 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid buffers.74 This experimental observation seems to be in
conflict with the present computational result revealing that the
coordination of H2PO4– to
Fe(II) facilitates the Fenton reaction both in kinetic and thermodynamic
aspects (Figure 4).
One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the phosphate
buffer does not inhibit the Fenton reaction but instead scavenges
hydroxyl radicals. To test this possibility, the reactions of hydrogen
atom transfer (HAT) from H2PO4– and HPO42– to •OH
radical were simulated by models with and without explicit water molecules.
For comparison, the corresponding reaction of tert-butyl alcohol, a common scavenger for •OH radical,
was computed as well. The calculated activation energies and reaction
energies are given in Table 3, and the optimized transition state structures are depicted
in Figure 7.

The calculations without the explicit
H2O reveal that
both H2PO4– and HPO42– could efficiently scavenge the •OH radical. Both HAT reactions were highly exergonic and possessed
a very small activation barrier (Table 3); the transition state for the HPO42– system cannot even be located, as a potential energy
surface scan manifested a continuous descent of energy along the reaction
coordinate of HAT. However, when explicit H2O molecules
are incorporated in the calculations, the situation is somewhat different.
Although the •OH radical scavenging reactions of
H2PO4– and HPO42– are still feasible, now the activation barrier
is increased and the exergonicity is reduced and becomes less efficient
compared to that of tert-butyl alcohol (Table 3). The reduction of •OH radical scavenging activity of H2PO4– and HPO42– in explicit solvation model is ascribed to the charge transfer from
anionic solutes to H2O solvent molecules, the effect that
is not taken into account in implicit solvation model. The natural
population analysis indicates that about −0.032 and −0.250
|e| negative charges are, respectively, transferred
from H2PO4– and HPO42– to H2O solvent molecules; the delocalization
of the negative charge is intuitively expected to stabilize anions
and, therefore, diminish their ability to be oxidized. By contrast,
the effect of charge transfer between solute and solvent molecules
is negligible for neutral tert-butyl alcohol; the
NPA charge on tert-butyl alcohol in explicit solvation
model is only 0.001 au, very close to neutral. As a result, the incorporation
of explicit H2O displays a relatively minor influence on
the computed energies of the HAT reaction for tert-butyl alcohol (Table 3).

The present calculations indicate that even though the Fenton
reaction
in phosphate buffers results in the •OH radical
formation, the reaction of •OH with phosphates can
act to remove it from the reaction mixture. However, it does not mean
that this system cannot be used as reactive species because almost
all organic compounds react with •OH with a faster
rate than phosphates.75,76

3.5 Ligand
Design Strategy for ROS Control
On the basis of these DFT
results, a strategy to control the nature
of ROS generated in the Fenton reaction was proposed. For a ligand
able to promote the production of hydroxyl radical and suppress the
formation of oxoiron(IV) species in the Fenton reaction should consist
of two critical components. First, it must possess multiple anionic
coordination sites. The purpose is to raise the pKa of coordinated water on Fe(III), or in other words,
to enhance the basicity of Fe(III)–OH. Second, the ligand should
be furnished with dangling protic functional groups in the second
coordination sphere. These protic functional groups can serve as a
readily available proton source to protonate Fe(III)–OH, which,
in turn, obstructs the further transformation to Fe(IV)=O.

4 Conclusions
DFT calculations have shown that
the iron ion in phosphate buffers
is highly coordinated by phosphate ions. Such a coordination environment
significantly raises the pKa of Fe(III)
and, thus, inhibits the formation of the conjugate base Fe(III)–OH
and the following transformation to Fe(IV)=O in a wide pH range
extending to the basic site. Similar effect is expected to occur on
other metal ions in phosphate buffers. This finding calls for caution
against assigning unverified Mn+–OH
species (M = metals) in phosphate buffer solutions or even in other
coordinating buffers, since conventional pKa data for metal ions in aqueous solutions can be inapplicable in
such buffer systems. Moreover, the calculations demonstrate that on
the one hand the coordination of phosphate ions to Fe(II) can facilitate
the Fenton reaction and promote the generation of •OH radicals, on the other hand, phosphate ions have the capability
to scavenge •OH radicals, albeit not as efficiently
as the commonly used scavengers such as tert-butyl
alcohol. This result suggests that (i) intracellular fluids, which
comprise a relatively high concentration of phosphate ions, provide
a basic protection against •OH radicals and (ii)
phosphate buffer is not a good choice for the study of •OH radical. The present study not only advances our ability to precisely
control the Fenton oxidation process and expand its applications but
also has a broad impact on the aqueous chemistry of transition-metal
ions.

Efforts to locate the TSPT connecting INT2OH/•OH and INTFeIII+•OH have been made but failed. Instead, the transition state and the
activation energy of the proton transfer step were calculated by using
the system without •OH, namely in [FeIII(H2PO4)5(OH)]3–, and the resulting barrier was added to INT2OH/•OH in Figure 2.
