In dipolar organic π-conjugated
molecules, variable photophysical
properties can be realized through efficient excited-state intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT), which essentially depends on the π-conjugation
patterns. Herein, we report a controllable regioselective strategy
for synthesis and optical properties of two donor–acceptor
(DA)-type 1,3,5,9-tetraarylpyrenes (i.e., 1,3-A/5,9-D (4b) and 1,3-D/5,9-A (4c)) by covalently integrating two
phenyl rings and two p-OMe/CHO-substituted phenyl
units into the 2-tert-butylpyrene building block,
in which the two phenyl rings substituted at the 1,3-positions act
as acceptors for 4b or as donors for 4c and
the two p-OMe or p-CHO-substituted
phenyl moieties substituted at the K-region of 5,9-positions act as
donors for 4b or as acceptors for 4c, respectively.
Density functional theory calculations on their frontier molecular
orbitals and UV–vis absorption of S0 → S1 transition theoretically predicted that the change of π-conjugation
directions in the two DA pyrenes could be realized through a variety
of substitution patterns, implying that the dissimilar ground-state
and excited-state electronic structures exist in each molecule. Their
single-crystal X-ray analysis reveal their highly twisted conformations
that are beneficial for inhibiting the π-aggregations, which
are strikingly different from the normal 1,3,5,9-tetraphenylpyrenes
(4a) and related 1,3,6,8-tetraarylpyrenes. Indeed, experimental
investigations on their optical properties demonstrated that the excited-state
ICT pathways can be successfully controlled by the change of π-conjugation
directions through the variety of substitution positions, resulting
in the modulations of emission color from deep-blue to green in solution.
Moreover, for the present DA pyrenes, highly fluorescent emissions
with moderate-to-high quantum yields both in the thin film and in
the doped poly(methyl methacrylate) film were obtained, suggesting
them as promising emitting materials for the fabrication of organic
light-emitting diodes.

Introduction
For organic π-conjugated
systems, investigating the relationships
of substitution positions, π-conjugation patterns, intramolecular
charge-transfer pathways, and variable photophysical properties is
of interest. Dipolar organic molecules with donor–acceptor
(DA)-type structures have been considered as ideal materials for optoelectronic
devices,1,2 nonlinear optics,3−8 and biological applications9 in recent
years. For such materials, a suitable choice of the electron donor
and acceptor groups selectively substituted in the periphery of the
organic π-conjugated system can provide highly variable photophysical
properties through efficient excited-state intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT),10 which essentially depends on the
static π-conjugation pattern (such as degree, pathway, etc.).11−13 Therefore, developing new DA-type π-conjugated molecules with
individual electronic structures and ICT pathways for future organic
optoelectronics and biological medicine is of great importance.

As one of the organic π-conjugated systems, pyrene has attracted
considerable attention due to its specific fluorescence characteristics,
such as the Ham effect14 and the excimer
emission.15 In fact, pyrene and its derivatives
have been widely used as fluorescence probes16 for applications in biomedicine, as semiconductors17 for applications in organic optoelectronics, and as absorption
materials18−22 for applications in nonlinear optics in the past two decades. It
is well known that pyrene exhibits strong positional dependence along
the long axis (active site of 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions and plane
node of 2-, 7-positions) and the short axis (K-region of 4-, 5-, 9-
and 10-positions). Generally, pyrene possesses the equivalent activity
of the site at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions that makes asymmetric
functionalization of the pyrene ring to remain a big challenge. Meanwhile,
the substitution of D/A groups at different positions of the pyrene
would bring interesting optoelectronic properties, which make the
fine tuning of photophysical properties of the pyrenes to be possible
through the ICT processes.23 For example,
the photophysical properties of 2- and 2,7-substituted pyrenes have
significant differences in their optical behaviors when compared to
the more typical 1-substituted analogues.23 Thanks to the chemists’ efforts and the progress in modern
synthetic methodology, pyrene has recently been used as a building
block for the construction of dipolar organic-conjugated molecules24−34 (Figure 1). These
DA pyrenes developed up to date can be classified into three substitution
patterns: (i) at the active site of 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions24−26,30,32−34 (Figure 1A), (ii) at the plane node of 2-, 7-positions29,31,34 and the K-region of 4-, 5-, 9-,
10-positions27,28 (Figure 1B, left), and (iii) at the fusion site of
2,7-/4,5- and/or 1,8-/4,5-positions28 (Figure 1B, right). The photophysical
properties for the DA pyrenes are strikingly influenced by the ICT
processes through the change of the substitution positions (see Figure 1), thereby making
these molecules potential candidates as optoelectronic materials,24,26,29 solvent polarity sensors,28 photostable fluorophores,32 etc.

pathways in donor–acceptor substituted pyrenes. D = donor and

As previously mentioned,
since the dynamic ICT processes essentially
depend on the corresponding static π-conjugation patterns,11−13 assuming that the change of π-conjugation directions in the
dipolar organic π-conjugated molecules could be realized by
the variety of the substitution patterns, in which case variable photophysical
properties are achievable through the corresponding ICT process. As
per this concept, for the above-pointed three substitution patterns
at the 1-, 3-, 6-, 8- and/or 2-, 7- and/or 4-, 5-, 9-, 10-positions
of the DA pyrenes, this hypothesis is nearly impossible because of
the equivalent activity of the site on the pyrene ring. Meanwhile,
the realization of the change of π-conjugation directions in
the fusion site of the 2,7-/4,5- and/or 1,8-/4,5-position-substituted
DA pyrenes is also inadvisable due to the lack of straightforward
strategy for modifying the synthetic routes.28 Interestingly enough, Yamato et al. recently reported an effective
approach to brominate 2-tert-butylpyrene both at
the active site of 1,3-positions and the K-region of 5,9-positions.35,36 The proposed bromination mechanism is that the bromo atoms first
substituted at the 1- and 3-positions of pyrene37 could sterically hinder the 4- and 10-positions, thereby
enabling regioselective substitutions at the 5- and 9-positions because
the tert-butyl group at the 7-position plays a role
to protect the ring against electrophilic attack at the 6- and 8-positions.24 Accordingly, this approach theoretically provides
a reasonable and useful synthetic strategy for the construction of
DA-type pyrenes substituted at the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-positions.

Herein, we present an effective approach for the synthesis and
optical properties of two dipolar organic molecules from 2-tert-butylpyrene, in which two phenyl rings substituted
at the 1,3-positions act as acceptors for 4b or as donors
for 4c and two p-OMe or p-CHO-substituted phenyl moieties substituted at the K-region of 5,9-positions
act as donors for 4b or as acceptors for 4c, respectively (Scheme 1). We demonstrated that the fluorescence emission colors of the investigated
DA pyrenes in solution are well modulated by solely varying the attachment
of p-donor (OMe)- and p-acceptor
(CHO)-substituted phenyl groups to the K-region (5- and 9-positions,
deep-blue for 4b and green for 4c), indicating
that the ICT pathways in the present DA pyrenes can be controlled
by the change of π-conjugation directions through the variety
of substitution patterns (Figure 1C).

Results and Discussion
Quantum
Chemistry Computation
Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations on the optimized geometries and the electron density
distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) were first
performed by the Gaussian 16 program, using the B3LYP functional and
the polarized 6-31G* basis set.38 The calculated
dipole moments were 0.36 for 4a (derived from its weak
polar symmetrical structure) and 4.37 for 4c, higher
compared to the value of 2.30 for 4b (derived from the
stronger polar symmetrical structure of 4c). As shown
in Figure 2A, the dihedral
angles between the pyrene core and the phenyl planes in the optimized
geometries of 4a–c are ca. 54–58°,
which should be beneficial for inhibiting the π–π
stacking in the solid state. Figure 2B depicts the separated highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals
of 4 in their optimized geometries. Apparently, for 4a and 4b, the HOMO is predominantly located
over the entire pyrene framework in each molecule, while the aryl
substituted groups have limited contributions to this system. However,
the HOMO of 4c is mainly located on the pyrene core and
the 1,3-substituted phenyl rings have notable contributions to this
molecule. In contrast, when compared to that of 4a, the
LUMO of 4b is mainly located both on the center pyrene
core and the 1,3-substituted phenyl rings, implying the two phenyl
rings play the electron-accepting nature; similarly, the LUMO of 4c is predominantly located on both p-CHO-substituted
phenyl groups at the 5,9-positions of K-region and the pyrene core.
The different HOMO/LUMO distributions of 4a/b and 4c imply that the dissimilar ground-state and/or
excited-state electronic structures exist in each molecule, which
theoretically originate from the change of π-conjugation directions
through the variety of substitution patterns (Figure 1C), thereby variable photophysical properties
are highly expected. The computed UV–vis absorption (Figure S1) of S0 → S1 transition of 4 also gave similar theoretical evidences
for implying their dissimilar electronic structures. This can be further
illustrated by the calculated values in Figure 2B and Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

and 4c (right).

Synthesis and Characterization
There could be several
possible bromination conditions to prepare the novel bromide precursor
of 1,3-diphenyl-5,9-dibromopyrene used for synthesizing the proposed
DA architectures (4). After many synthetic attempts,
we finally found that the bromination condition39 in CH2Cl2 at a low temperature of
−78 °C is very effective. According to the reported procedures,
the 2-tert-butylpyrene (1),40 7-tert-butyl-1,3-dibromopyrene,39 and 7-tert-butyl-1,3-diphenylpyrene
(2)37 were synthesized in
high yields and the treatment of which with bromine (2 equiv) in CH2Cl2 at −78 °C surprisingly gave the
desired 5,9-dibromopyrene (3) in high isolated yield
of 71%. Then, Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of (3) with
the corresponding arylboronic acids yielded the expected 1,3,5,9-tetraarylpyrenes
in isolated yields of 65–74% (Scheme 1).

The structure of 4 was
fully characterized by 1H/13C NMR spectra, Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, as well
as elemental analysis (the spectroscopic analysis of 4a is same as the literature,35 see Supporting Information). The two DA compounds 4b and 4c were highly soluble in common organic
solvents, such as cyclohexane, toluene, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, THF, acetonitrile, and N,N-dimethylformamide. The thermal properties (Figure S21) of 4b and 4c were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal data for the pyrenes 4 are listed in Table 1.

Single-Crystal
X-ray Structures
Single-crystal X-ray
analysis41 also confirmed the structures
of 4b and 4c (Tables S2–S4). A noticeable feature in the molecular structure
of 4b and 4c is highly twisted conformation
between the pyrene core and the phenyl groups, which is slightly different
from 4a.35 The dihedral angles
between the pyrene core and the phenyl planes are ca. 58.4, 62.7,
61.8, and 67.1° for 4b and 62.8, 50.2, 74.2, and
−77.9° for 4c (Figure 3). Comparing their computed optimized geometries,
it has found that for 4b, it is almost identical; however,
a different geometry was observed in the crystal structure of 4c, which might be due to the existence of the hydrogen-bonding
interactions originating from the substituents of p-CHO groups (Figures 2A and S9). This conformation is more effective
for inhibiting π–π stacking and releasing the steric
interactions in the thin film compared to that of 4a.35 In the two crystals, C–H···π
interactions (only for 4b, Figure S4) and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Figure S9) were observed and they can largely influence their
molecular geometries and effectively inhibit the excimer emission
in the solid film.42,43 Packing structures of 4b and 4c can be best described as an irregular packing
form without J-aggregations44−47 or H-aggregations48 for 4b (Figures S5 and S6) and a one-dimensional
columnar structure along the crystallographic c axis
with H-aggregations48 (π-stacking
(ca. 4.57 Å)) for 4c (Figure S10), which is strikingly different from 4a(35) and related 1,3,6,8-tetraarylpyrenes,49 with a two-dimensional self-assembled planar
solid-state structure for the former and a sandwichlike three-dimensional
structure for the latter overlapping the porous two-dimensional networks.35

Optical Properties
Figure 4 shows the
optical properties of the compounds 4 investigated in
CH2Cl2 and in a thin
film. As shown in Figure 4a, three compounds reveal broad S0 → 1CT absorption bands at 350–400 nm, which can be attributed
to the ICT processes.23 Interestingly,
for 4a and 4b, characteristic of their spectra
is almost the same with a broad and featured fine structure due to
their weak polar structure resulting in weak ICT processes; however, 4c exhibits a more broader and less well-resolved spectra,
which can be attributed to its stronger ICT processes originated from
its stronger polar structure. It should be noted that this difference
of S0 → 1CT absorption bands between 4b and 4c was mainly contributed from their individual
electronic structures and ICT pathways. The results are also in well
agreement with the DFT calculations on both FMOs and UV–vis
absorption of S0 → S1 transition (Figure S1).

of 4b and 4c in thin film and in 0.5 wt
%-doped PMMA film. (d) The 1931 CIE chromaticity coordinates of 4b and 4c in CH2Cl2 and

Upon excitation, the
three compounds clearly exhibit broad and
featureless emission spectra indicating that their S1 states
are identified as 1CT states, which is also confirmed by
the spatial separation of their FMOs. In addition, the emission maxima
at 412 nm for 4a and 419 nm for 4b (deep-blue)
reveal a smaller blue shift than the reported 1,3,5,9-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)pyrene35 (λmax = 421 nm). The three
compounds have a slight red-shift order of 1,3,5,9-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)
pyrene (4OMe) > 4b (2OMe) > 4a (H),
implying
the excited-state electronic contribution is mainly attributed to
the π-conjugation degree from the donor units of OMe. However,
very impressively, the 4c with two CHO moieties caused
a remarkable red shift (∼24 nm) and a broadened emission maximum
(λmax) at 493 nm (green) compared to those of the
1,3,5,9-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene35 with four CHO moieties (λmax = 469 nm), indicating
that the excited-state electronic contribution is predominantly attributed
to the ICT processes.23 The results further
demonstrated that the 4c with 1,3-D/5,9-A structure has
more efficient excited-state ICTs than those of 4b with
1,3-A/5,9-D structure, indicating that the variety of substitution
positions can realize the change of π-conjugation directions.
The 1CT energies of 4 calculated from the
onset of their prompt emission spectra are 3.20, 3.14, and 2.88 eV.
All photophysical data are fully summarized in Table 1.

Thin-Film Characterization
The thin-film
emission spectrum
of the two DA compounds displayed a prominent maximum emission in
the blue region at 432 nm for 4b and 461 nm for 4c (Figure 4c and Table 1). Interestingly,
the emission of 4b is drastically red shifted by 13 nm
related to the spectrum in CH2Cl2 solution,
which is ascribed to the formation of intermolecular C–H···π
interactions and the different dielectric constants,50 whereas the emission spectrum of 4c shows
a large hypsochromic shift (∼32 nm) with respect to the spectrum
in CH2Cl2 solution, which probably attributed
to its packing structures with H-aggregations.48 The results were also consistent with their single-crystal
analysis.

Solvatochromism Effect
As shown in Figures 5 and S22–S24, the spectral properties of the solvatochromism for 4 were investigated in different solvents with varying polarity (cyclohexane;
1,4-dioxane; ethyl ether; tetrahydrofuran; dichloromethane; dimethylformamide;
and acetonitrile). The 4b shows slightly solvatochromic
absorption (∼3 nm) and emission (∼7 nm) due to its weak
ICT progress (Figure S23). In contrast,
the emission spectra of 4c are highly sensitive toward
the solvent polarity, whereas the absorption spectra exhibit slight
shift (Figure S24). So, it could be interpreted
that the excited state is more sensitive to the solvent polarity than
that of the ground state. With increasing the solvent polarity from
cyclohexane to acetonitrile, the 4c exhibits a remarkable
red shift (∼76 nm, Figure 5a). This phenomenon was further evaluated by the relationship
between the Stokes-shifts in various solvents and the Lippert equation,51,52 which shows a linear correlation between these two factors (Figure S25). The trend in the slope of the Lippert–Mataga
plots follows the order of 4c > 4b > 4a, and the value of the slope of the fitting line for 4c (10 007) is far higher than that for 4b (645), indicating the intramolecular excited state has a larger
dipolar moment for the former than for the latter. The results also
indicated that the different solvatochromism behaviors between 4b and 4c were mainly attributed to their dissimilar
ICT pathways and effectiveness, which originate from the change of
π-conjugation directions through the variety of substitution
positions.

(b) Emission colors of 4c in different solvents under
365 nm UV illumination.

Doped PMMA Film Characterization
We also examined the
emission spectra of 4b and 4c in a 0.5 wt
%-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film.53 We observed a deep-blue emission with a maximum peak at
408 nm for 4b and 430 nm for 4c (Figure 4c),
which is almost identical to the corresponding emission in nonpolar
cyclohexane solution, and might be due to the formation of π–π
stacking interactions, C–H···π interactions,
and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions that can be further suppressed
in the doped films. The results suggest that these newly developed
DA pyrenes might be promising candidates for the fabrication of deep-blue
host–guest-based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).54,55 The quantum yields recorded in dilute CH2Cl2 and a thin film are 74 and 36% for 4b and 61 and 29%
for 4c, respectively. In contrast, the 0.5 wt %-doped
PMMA films of 4b and 4c exhibited higher
quantum yields of 65 and 52%, respectively. The higher quantum yields
of the doped PMMA film stem from the weaker aggregation-caused quenching
compared to that of thin film.

Electrochemical Properties
To investigate the electrochemical
properties of 4b and 4c, the oxidation potentials
were measured in CH2Cl2 solution. As shown in Figure S27, the oxidation potentials are around
+1.08 ± 0.05 V for 4b and +1.26 ± 0.05 V for 4c. The oxidation potential of 4b is appreciably
lower than that of 4c (+0.18 V). Thus, the two OMe substitutions
in the para position of phenyl ring could slightly reduce its ionization
potential. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 4b and 4c were estimated as −5.48, −5.66 and −2.43,
−2.70 eV, respectively (Table 1), which is in agreement with the theoretically calculated
data (Figure 2b).

Conclusions
In summary, we have established a reliable and
straightforward
access to the 1,3-A/5,9-D- and 1,3-D/5,9-A-tetraaryl-substituted pyrenes
from the 2-tert-butylpyrene. DFT calculations on
their FMOs and UV–vis absorption of S0 →
S1 transition theoretically predicted that the change of
π-conjugation directions in the two DA pyrenes could be realized
through the variety of substitution pattern, implying that the dissimilar
ground-state and excited-state electronic structures existed in each
molecule. Their single-crystal X-ray analysis reveals their highly
twisted conformations that are beneficial for inhibiting the π-aggregations
and are strikingly different from the normal 1,3,5,9-tetraarylpyrenes
and related 1,3,6,8-tetraarylpyrenes. Exactly, experimental investigations
on their photophysical properties demonstrated that the excited-state
ICT pathways can be successfully controlled by the change of π-conjugation
directions through the variety of substitution positions, resulting
in the modulations of emission color from deep-blue to green in solution.
Moreover, for the present DA pyrenes, highly fluorescent emissions
with moderate-to-high quantum yields both in the neat film and in
the doped PMMA film were obtained, suggesting them as promising emitting
materials for the fabrication of OLEDs. We believe that this effective
synthetic strategy might be applied to the other π-conjugated
systems for the development of new dipolar organic molecules. We thus
hope that the present DA pyrenes will contribute to the development
of organic optoelectronic materials in near future.
