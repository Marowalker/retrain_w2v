p-CuO with a band gap energy of 1.5 eV, p-Cu2O with
a band gap energy of 2.05 eV, and their bilayers were prepared by
controlling the potential of anodic and cathodic polarization in a
copper(II)–tartrate complex aqueous solution containing copper(II)
sulfate hydrate and tartaric acid in the dark and under light irradiation.
Electrochemical characteristics of the electrodeposition and the resultant
CuO and Cu2O layers were investigated with cyclic voltammetry,
chronoamperometry, and Mott–Schottky plots, and the structural
and optical characterizations were performed with X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, and optical absorption spectra measurements.
The CuO layer prepared at 0.4–0.7 V was composed of aggregates
of granular grains with the monoclinic lattice, and the Cu2O layer composed of coarse grains with the cubic lattice was deposited
at −0.4 to 0.6 V. The flat-band potentials were estimated to
be 0.145 and −0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for the CuO and Cu2O layers, respectively. The 0.4 μm CuO/1.1 μm Cu2O bilayers could be prepared by switching the electrodeposition
potentials of 0.4 and −0.4 V, irrespective of the presence
of light irradiation. The photoelectrodeposition under light irradiation
enabled the preparation of continuous and dense 1.1 μm Cu2O/0.4 μm CuO bilayer by controlling the potential, while
electrodeposition in the dark led to sparse, isolated, and coarse
Cu2O grains being deposited. The mechanism for the photoelectrodeposition
of the bilayers was discussed based on the energy band alignment at
the heterointerface to the Cu–tartrate complex solution.

==== Body
Introduction
Cupric oxide (CuO) and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) are p-type
semiconductors with band gap energies of 1.51 and 2.0 eV,2 and they both have been
employed as photocathodes in photoelectrochemical water-splitting
system for generating hydrogen gas3,4 and photovoltaic
layer in oxide solar cells.5,6 The photoactive performance
of the photocathode and photovoltaic layers closely relates to their
band gap energy,7 and combining two or
more p-type semiconductors with different band gap energies is an
excellent strategy to enhance the performance,8 as demonstrated by the 38% efficiency InGaP/GaAs multijunction solar
cell.9 A CuO/Cu2O bilayer satisfying
such a strategy was reported to act as a photocathode with superior
performance compared to that of single CuO and Cu2O layers.10,11

The CuO and Cu2O layers have been prepared by several
techniques of thermal oxidation12,13 and solution chemical
process.14,15 The solution chemical process offers several
advantages over thermal oxidation and gas phase processes, such as
saving energy due to low-temperature preparation and scalability for
mass production, as demonstrated by the preparation of the precursors
for Cu(In,Ga)Se216 and Cu2SnZnS4 solar cells.17 Also, CuO/Cu2O bilayers prepared by chemical processes,
followed by heating, were also reported,18,19 but nanopores and defects introduced during heating showed harmful
effects for the photoactive performance.20 The possibility of both CuO and Cu2O layers being prepared
by anodic and cathodic polarizations in an aqueous solution containing
copper(II) sulfate and tartaric acid was reported by Poizot et al.21 However, stacking of Cu2O on CuO
layers by electrodeposition was difficult because the electrons needed
for the Cu2O electrodeposition were the minority carriers
in the p-CuO layer.

Here, we report the electrochemical preparation
of the CuO and
Cu2O layers by anodic and cathodic polarization in a modified
copper(II)–tartrate complex aqueous solution and the direct,
continuous constructions of CuO/Cu2O and Cu2O/CuO bilayers by irradiating light at photon energies higher than
the underlying layer’s band gap energies during electrodepositions.
Electrochemical characterization was carried out for the preparation
of CuO, Cu2O, and bilayers by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry.
Their structure and energy states including the band gap energies
and flat-band potentials of the CuO and Cu2O layers were
investigated with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) observation, optical absorption spectra measurement, and Mott–Schottky
plots measurement. Furthermore, the mechanism of the photoelectrodeposition
of CuO/Cu2O bilayers was discussed based on the energy
states of the CuO and Cu2O layers.

Results and Discussion
Electrochemical Preparation of CuO and Cu2O Layers
by Anodic and Cathodic Polarization
The change in the appearance
of the aqueous solution containing a 0.3 mol L–1 copper(II) sulfate and 0.3 mol L–1 tartaric acid
with pH value is shown in Figure S1. The
pH value was adjusted using a NaOH aqueous solution. The solution
color changed from the precipitation-free light blue at pH 1.1 to
diluted light blue, cloudy dark blue, and clear dark violet over pH
11. The white precipitation was formed in the solution from pH 1.5
and then was dissolved by raising the pH value, resulting in the formation
of the precipitation-free dark violet solution at pH 13 by adding
1.5 mol L–1 NaOH; this solution was selected for
the electrodeposition of CuO and Cu2O.

Figure 1 shows the cyclic voltammogram
for the bare fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate in the solution,
and the cyclic voltammograms were recorded for the electrodeposition
of Cu2O and CuO layers under cathodic and anodic polarizations.
The red-colored Cu2O and black-colored CuO layers were
deposited by the cathodic and anodic polarizations, respectively,
and the electrochemical behavior closely related to the Cu–tartrate
complex species and the electrochemical reactions, as demonstrated
for the Cu2O electrodeposition in the Cu–lactate
complex solution22 and CuO electrodeposition
in the Cu–NH3–complex solution.15

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammogram for the FTO substrate in aqueous solution
containing
copper(II) sulfate and tartaric acid, and the appearance of the CuO
and Cu2O layers.

The electrolyte used in this study contains 0.3
mol L–1 copper(II) sulfate, 0.3 mol L–1l-tartaric
acid (H2L = HOOCCH(OH)CH(OH)COOH), and 1.5 mol L–1 NaOH. The molar ratio of Cu2+/H2L/OH– is 1:1:5 and the pH of the resulting solution is ∼13. No
precipitation occurred despite the strong alkaline solution due to
the formation of Cu(II)–tartrate complex. Complex species in
strongly alkaline solutions of Cu(II)–tartaric acid, also known
as Fehling’s solution, have recently been investigated by Hörner
et al.23 According to the literature, two
complexes, [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– and [Cu(H–2L)2]6–, are proposed to be stable in the strong alkaline
region above pH 10. The tartrate ligand, H–2L4– = –OOCCH(O–)CH(O–)COO–, has a structure in which four
protons are lost from the two carboxyl groups and two hydroxyl groups.
Considering the molar ratio of Cu2+ to H2L (1:1)
in the prepared solution, the predominant complex present in the electrolyte
would be [Cu2(H–2L)2]4–. The formation of this tartrate ligand requires at
least 4 equiv NaOH to tartaric acid. The fact that the pH value ∼13
of the electrolyte containing 0.3 mol L–1 tartaric
acid and 1.5 mol L–1 (5 equiv) NaOH is consistent
with the formation of [Cu2(H–2L)2]4–. The expected structure of the [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– complex
and the calculated fraction of complex species23 present depending on the solution pH are shown in Figure S2.

In the anodic polarization curve
in Figure 1, the anodic
current density increased from
0.27 V, and the black-colored CuO layer was deposited on the FTO substrate.
The current densities were estimated to be 0.21, 0.65, 2.4, and 5.7
mA cm–2 at 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 V, respectively.
It has already been reported that the CuO electrodeposition by the
anodic polarization from the Cu–NH3 complex solution
was induced by the oxygen gas generation reaction at the potential
positive than that for the following reaction14  Since the potential of 0.27 V was close to
0.266 V for the oxygen gas generation reaction at pH 13, the formation
of the CuO layer from the [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– complex was induced by the oxygen gas
generation reaction like the Cu–NH3 complex solution.

When the potential was brought to the negative side, the cathodic
current density gradually increased from −0.2 V and then rapidly
increased from −0.6 V. The current densities were estimated
to be −0.63, −0.65, −2.3, and −4.1 mA
cm–2 at −0.4, −0.5, −0.6, and
−0.7 V, respectively. The red-colored Cu2O layer
was deposited from the [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– complex at a potential more negative
than −0.2 V, although the equilibrium potential could not be
calculated due to absence of data on the thermodynamic property of
the complex. Also, the potential of −0.5 V was close to that
for the following reaction at pH 13  Also, there was a possibility of the direct
electrodeposition of metallic Cu from the [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– complex.

Figure 2 shows the
X-ray diffraction patterns of the CuO and Cu2O layers prepared
on FTO substrates by anodic polarizations at potentials from 0.4 to
0.7 V and cathodic polarizations at −0.4 to −0.7 V.
Four peaks assigned as (002), (111̅), (111), and (200) planes
with a characteristic monoclinic lattice24 could be observed for the CuO layer prepared at 0.4 V at 35.37,
35.59, 38.48, and 38.99°, respectively, in addition to those
originating from SnO2 in the FTO substrate. The (002) peak
disappeared and the (200) peak strengthened at potentials more positive
than 0.5 V, indicating changes in the preferred orientation. The diffraction
angles of (111̅) and (200) peaks were of almost constant values,
irrespective of the potentials. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
values of the CuO (111̅) plane were almost constant values of
0.32–0.34°, irrespective of the preparation potentials,
which were smaller than 0.76° for a CuO layer prepared in a Cu–NH3 complex aqueous solution.15

Figure 2 X-ray diffraction
patterns for the CuO layers (A) prepared at 0.4
V (a), 0.5 V (b), 0.6 V (c), and 0.7 V (d) and the Cu2O
layers (B) prepared at −0.4 V (e), −0.5 V (f), −0.6
V (g), and −0.7 V (h).

The red-colored Cu2O layers prepared
at −0.4
to −0.6 V showed X-ray peaks assigned as the (110), (111),
and (200) planes of the characteristic cubic lattice25 at 29.6, 36.04, and 42.23°, and the intensity ratios
were almost constant, irrespective of the potentials. Additionally,
two additional peaks assigned as the (111) and (200) planes of metallic
Cu were observed at −0.7 V. The deposition potential of −0.7
V was more negative than −0.5 V for the reduction reaction
of Cu2O to Cu, and it was possible that trace metallic
Cu was incorporated in the Cu2O layer at −0.6 V.
The FWHM values of the Cu2O (111) peak were almost constant
values of 0.13°, irrespective of the preparation potentials.

Figure 3 shows the
surface and cross-sectional structures of the CuO layers prepared
at 0.4–0.7 V. The CuO layers were composed of aggregates of
columnar grains with the size of approximately 0.48 μm, which
were deposited over the entire surface of the FTO substrate without
any defects, such as pores, on both the surface and cross-sectional
structure. The grain morphology was significantly distinct from the
fan-shaped grain of the CuO layer prepared on the FTO substrate in
the Cu–NH3 complex aqueous solution.15 The thicknesses of CuO layers were estimated
to be 0.80, 0.58, 0.39, and 0.36 μm at 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7
V, respectively. The change in the thicknesses was consistent with
the decrease in the height of the CuO(111̅) peak shown in Figure 2, indicating the
change in the current efficiency by the potential.

Figure 3 Field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of
the surface morphologies (A) and cross-sectional structures (B) for
CuO layers prepared at 0.4 V (a), 0.5 V (b), 0.6 V (c), and 0.7 V
(d).

Figure 4 shows the
surface and cross-sectional structures of Cu2O layers prepared
at −0.4 to −0.7 V. The cubic-shaped and isolated Cu2O grains were deposited on the FTO substrate, with bare FTO
substrate surface clearly observable between the Cu2O grains.
The size of the cubic Cu2O grains decreased from 7.8 to
2.0 μm, and the grains’ density increased with change
in potential from −0.4 to −0.6 V. At −0.7 V,
1.25 μm sized Cu2O cubic grains were deposited over
the entire FTO substrate, and additional cauliflower-shaped grains
(shown by the arrow in Figure 4A(d)) were speculated to be metallic Cu as detected by the
X-ray diffraction. A dense Cu2O layer without any defect
such as pores could be formed on the FTO substrates by cathodic polarization
in a Cu-lactic acid aqueous solution.26 This shows that the solution formulation strongly affects the structure,
including grain morphologies for both the CuO and Cu2O
layers.

Figure 4 FE-SEM images of the surface morphologies (A) and cross-sectional
structures (B) for Cu2O layers prepared at −0.4
V (a), −0.5 V (b), −0.6 V (c), and −0.7 V (d).

Figure 5 shows the
optical absorption spectra and the relationship between the absorption
coefficient and photon energy for the CuO layers prepared at 0.4–0.7
V and Cu2O layers prepared at −0.4 to −0.7
V. The absorption coefficients were estimated from the absorbance
and layer thickness, and the grain height was used alternative to
the thickness for the Cu2O layers prepared at −0.7
V due to the vacancies between the Cu2O grains. The CuO
layers possessed absorption edges at around 830 nm in wavelength,
and the absorbance at 400 nm increased with increase in the CuO thickness.
The absorption coefficient was almost constant at around 4 ×
104 cm–1, irrespective of the potential.
The band gap energy (Eg) can be estimated
by using the following relationship between (αhν)n and photon energy (hν)  where α, h, and ν
are the absorption coefficient, Plank’s constant, and frequency
of light, respectively, and n is 2 or 1/2 for direct
or indirect transition, respectively.27 The band gap energies were estimated to be 1.5 eV for all the CuO
layers with the assumption of indirect transition, and this value
agreed with the one already reported.15 The Cu2O layers possessed absorption edges at around
610 nm, irrespective of the potentials, and the band gap energies
were estimated to be 2.05 eV with the assumption of direct transition.
The absorbance increased by decreasing vacancies between Cu2O grains when the potential was brought to the negative side from
−0.4 to −0.7 V. The Cu2O layer prepared at
−0.7 V showed a high absorbance at wavelengths longer than
610 nm due to the incorporation of opaque metallic Cu.

and the relationship between the absorption
coefficient and photon energy (insets) for CuO layers (A) prepared
at 0.4 V (a), 0.5 V (b), 0.6 V (c), and 0.7 V (d) and for Cu2O layers (B) prepared at −0.4 V (e), −0.5 V (f), −0.6
V (g), and −0.7 V (h).

Figure 6 shows the
flat-band potentials estimated from the Mott–Schottky plots
(Figures S3 and S4) for CuO layers prepared
at 0.4–0.7 V and Cu2O layers prepared at −0.4
to −0.7 V. The relationship between the space-change capacitance
(C) and potential (E) in the Mott–Schottky
plots is as follows  where ε, ε0, NA, Efb, K, T, and e are the permittivity
of vacuum, dielectric constant of the semiconductor, carrier density,
flat-band potential, Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and
charge of electron, respectively.28 The
flat-band potential is estimated by extrapolating the linear part
to , and the carrier density corresponding
to the acceptor density was estimated from the slope of the linear
part. All of the CuO layers were p-type semiconductors, concluded
from the negative slopes of the linear parts, irrespective of the
potential. Also, the flat-band potentials (Efb) were estimated to be approximate constant values of 0.149
± 0.003 V (vs Ag/Ag Cl) for all CuO layers, irrespective of the
potential. It has been reported for CuO layers prepared by electrodeposition
in an aqueous solution containing a copper(II) sulfate and glycine
that the flat-band potential varied from 0.01 to 0.31 V (vs Ag/AgCl)
depending on the solution pH,29 and the
flat-band potential around 0.149 V was located within this variation.
Also, a flat-band potential of 0.79 V (vs RHE) was reported for a
CuO layer prepared by heating a Cu2O layer electrodeposited
in a Cu–lactic acid aqueous solution,10 which is very close to 0.145 V (vs Ag/AgCl) obtained in this study.
Also, all the Cu2O layers were identified as p-type semiconductors
from the negative slopes of the linear parts for the Mott–Schottky
plots, and the flat-band potentials (Efb) were estimated to be −0.106, −0.09, and −0.080
V (vs Ag/AgCl) at the deposition potentials of −0.4, −0.5,
and −0.6 V, respectively. A flat-band potential of 0.55 V (vs
RHE) was reported for the Cu2O layer prepared by electrodeposition
in the Cu–lactic acid aqueous solution10 and was close to those obtained at −0.4 to −0.6 V.
A flat-band potential of −0.009 V for the Cu2O layer
prepared at −0.7 V was different compared to the values obtained
at −0.4 to −0.6 V due to the incorporation of metallic
Cu. The flat-band potential (Efb) closely
relates to the Fermi level (EF) of the
CuO and Cu2O semiconductors,30 and the location of Fermi level (EF)
changed depending on the acceptor density (NA) in the p-type semiconductor, as represented by the following
equation  where VBM and NV represent the valence band maximum and effective density of the
state.31 The almost constant flat-band
potentials reflected the almost constant acceptor densities for the
CuO and Cu2O layers, except for the Cu-incorporated Cu2O layer prepared at −0.7 V. From the slope of the Mott–Schottky
plots, the acceptor densities obtained for the CuO layers prepared
at 0.4–0.7 V were in the orders of 1016 to 1017 cm–3 and for the Cu2O layers
prepared at −0.4 to −0.6 V were in the order of 1016 cm–3. These values were close to those
already reported for the CuO layers prepared by heating the Cu2O electrodeposits and for the Cu2O layers electrodeposited
in the Cu(II)–lactic acid solution.10

Figure 6 Effects
of the deposition potentials on the flat-band potentials
for CuO (A) and Cu2O layers (B).

The effect of the insertion of the n-ZnO layer
on the structure
of CuO and Cu2O layers prepared at 0.4 and −0.4
V is shown in Figure S5. The insertion
of the n-ZnO layer between the Cu2O layer and FTO substrate
induced the change in Cu2O grain structure from isolated
coarse grains (Figure 4) to a dense and continuous layer. The degree of the preferred orientation
was estimated by calculating Harris’s texture coefficient, Tc, by the following equation  where Im(hkl), I0(hkl), and n are the relative intensity of the measured
(hkl) peak, the relative intensity of the (hkl) peak of the standard sample, and the total number of
peaks used for the calculation, respectively.32 The Tc(111) for the Cu2O(111)
plane was calculated by using the (110), (111), and (200) peaks and
was estimated to be 0.7 and 1.4 for the Cu2O layers prepared
on bare FTO and n-ZnO/FTO substrate. The n-ZnO layer possessed a (0001)
preferred orientation from the X-ray diffraction pattern and maintains
a lattice relationship of the (111) Cu2O//(0001) ZnO with
a lattice mismatch of 7.1%. On the other hand, the orientation of
the SnO2 layer in the FTO substrate was dispersed randomly.
The n-ZnO layer and its orientation affected the grain structure and
the preferred orientation of the resultant Cu2O layer.
The insertion of the n-ZnO layer between the CuO layer and the FTO
substrate showed no effects on the grain structure, thickness, and
intensity ratio of the diffracted X-ray peaks of the CuO layer. There
was a large lattice mismatch of over 15% for the (200) CuO/(0001)
ZnO combination, and the lattice relationships between the monoclinic
CuO and hexagonal ZnO lattices is a reason for no effects of the ZnO
layer insertion on the electrochemical growth of the CuO layer. The
potentials at 0.4 and −0.4 V were selected for the electrodeposition
of CuO and Cu2O layers in bilayer constructions due to
the small overpotential.

Photoelectrodeposition of CuO/Cu2O Bilayers
Figure 7 shows the
chronoamperometry curves for the construction of Cu2O/CuO
and CuO/Cu2O bilayers on the n-ZnO/FTO substrate by automatic
switching of the potential in dark and under light irradiation from
the SLG substrate side. The electric charge for the electrodeposition
for both CuO and Cu2O layers was set at a constant absolute
value of 1 C cm–2. In the construction of the CuO/Cu2O bilayer in dark, the cathodic current density increased
from zero to a maximum value of −1.86 mA cm–2 when −0.4 V was applied for the Cu2O electrodeposition,
and 662 s were needed for 1 C cm–2 (Figure 7A(a)). The following current
density rapidly changed to the anodic side when 0.4 V was applied
for the CuO electrodeposition and reached a plateau region at around
0.637 mA cm–2, which ended at 2,314 s in dark. The
light irradiation induced an increase in the cathodic current density
to −3.40 mA cm–2, which decreased with the
passage of the deposition time till 388 s for the Cu2O
electrodeposition, but no effect on the anodic current density was
observed for the CuO electrodeposition (Figure 7A(b)). During the construction of the Cu2O/CuO bilayer in the dark, the anodic current density for
the CuO electrodeposition gradually increased to 0.871 mA cm–2 at 2,816 s, and the current density rapidly shifted to zero when
−0.4 V was applied for the Cu2O electrodeposition
(Figure 7B(a)). The
cathodic current density slowly increased to −0.848 mA cm–2 at 5,676 s, showing that a deposition time of 2,860
s was needed for the Cu2O electrodeposition of 1 C cm–2. The light irradiation gave a slight increase in
anodic current density to 1.23 mA cm–2 and decreased
slightly till 1,220 s (Figure 7B(b)). Applying −0.4 V for the Cu2O electrodeposition
induced a rapid change to the cathodic side with a maximum value of
−2.7 mA cm–2, and the deposition time for
1 C cm–2 shortened to 531 s, compared to 2,860 s
in dark. The light irradiation strongly affected the Cu2O electrodeposition, but the effect was small for the CuO electrodeposition.

Figure 7 Chronoamperometry
curves for the photoelectrochemical deposition
of CuO/Cu2O (A) and Cu2O/CuO bilayers (B) on
ZnO/SLG substrates in dark (a) and under light irradiation (b). Potential
for the electrodepositions of the CuO and Cu2O was set
at 0.4 and −0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl.

Figure 8 shows the
surface and cross-sectional images of CuO/Cu2O and Cu2O/CuO bilayers prepared by switching the potential in the
dark and under light irradiation. The CuO and Cu2O layers
in bilayers possessed characteristic monoclinic and cubic lattices
with characteristic band gap energies of 1.50 and 2.05 eV, respectively,
as shown in Figures S6 and S7. The CuO/Cu2O bilayers prepared in the dark and under light irradiation
were almost the same in terms of the grain structures and thicknesses
for both the CuO and Cu2O layers. The thickness of the
CuO and Cu2O layers were 0.4 and 1.0 μm, respectively,
and the CuO layers composed of granular grains were deposited over
the entire Cu2O layer, irrespective of the light irradiation.

Figure 8 FE-SEM
images of surface morphologies (A) and cross-sectional structures
(B) for CuO/Cu2O (a) and Cu2O/CuO bilayers (b)
prepared on the n-ZnO/FTO substrate in the dark and under irradiation.

The light irradiation showed a drastic effect on
the electrodeposition
and structure of the Cu2O layer on the CuO layer, although
the structure and thickness of the CuO layer deposited on the n-ZnO/FTO
substrate were almost the same in the dark and under light irradiation.
The isolated Cu2O grains approximately 2 μm in size
were deposited sparsely on the CuO layer, and the underlying CuO surface
could be observed between the Cu2O grains when deposited
in the dark. The light irradiation contributes to the formation of
continuous and dense Cu2O layer composed of the 2 μm
size coarse grains without any pores.

Figure 9 shows the
schematic illustration of the mechanism for photoelectrodeposition
of the CuO layer on the Cu2O layer and vice versa. The
flat-band potentials were estimated to be 0.145 and −0.106
V referenced to Ag/AgCl electrode for the CuO layer prepared at 0.4
V and Cu2O layer prepared at −0.4 V. In the anodic
deposition of the CuO layer on the Cu2O layer, the holes
(h+), that are the majority carriers,
are swept toward the Cu(II)–tartrate complex solution by the
electric field formed at the heterointerface at an applied potential
of 0.4 V. Also, the ejected holes cause the anodic deposition (AD)
of a layer from the alkaline Cu(II)–tartaric acid solution
(pH ∼13), which is mainly composed of [Cu2(H–2L)2]4–, by the plausible
mechanism as follows        The anodic potential applied to the FTO substrate
decomposes H2O to generate H+, decreasing the
local pH on the substrate surface (AD-i). The [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– complex is partially
protonated to give [Cu2(H–1L)2]2–, which is unstable in the alkaline region,22 causing the precipitation of Cu(OH)2 on the substrate (AD-ii, iii). Subsequently, CuO crystals grow through
the dehydration of Cu(OH)2 (AD-iv). A similar mechanism
has been proposed for the anodic deposition of Ag2O from
an alkaline solution containing [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex.33 The irradiated light
at photon energy over the band gap energy induces the excitation of
electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, resulting
in the increase in the amount of electrons, which are the minority
carriers, but the excited electrons are confined in the Cu2O layer due to the energy barrier formed at the heterointerface.
Additional holes were generated by the excitation of electrons, but
the amount was much less compared to the intrinsic amount of hole
that is the majority carrier in the Cu2O layer. The effects
of the light irradiation were limited to the electrodeposition and
structure of the CuO layer, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 9 Schematic illustrations for the photoelectrochemical
deposition
of CuO on Cu2O layer (a) and Cu2O on CuO layer
(b).

During the Cu2O deposition on the CuO
layer, the energy
barrier in the CuO layer bends downward at the heterointerface to
the Cu–tartrate complex solution at −0.4 V for the Cu2O electrodeposition. The cathodic deposition (CD) mechanism
of Cu2O from an alkaline Cu(II)–tartaric acid solution
(pH ∼ 13) is mainly composed of [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– and can be explained as follows,
similar to the cathodic Cu2O deposition from a Cu(II)–lactic
acid solution34      The cathodic potential applied to the FTO
substrate reduces [Cu2(H–2L)2]4– to generate unstable Cu+, which
is then hydroxylated to precipitate CuOH on the substrate (CD-i, ii).
The Cu2O crystals grow through the dehydration of CuOH
(CD-iii). As such, since the electrons needed for the Cu2O electrodeposition are the minority carriers in the CuO layer, the
number of electrons is quite low just after −0.4 V was applied
and were then gradually transported to the heterointerface to the
Cu–tartrate complex solution, resulting in the formation of
isolated and coarse Cu2O grains in dark. The light irradiation
at the photon energies higher than the band gap energy induced the
increase in the number of electrons as minority carriers by excitation
from the valence band to the conduction band, which were then swept
down to the Cu–tartrate complex solution, resulting in the
formation of a continuous Cu2O layer. This consideration
is consistent with the difference in the electrodeposition and structure
of the Cu2O layer prepared on the CuO layer in the dark
and under light irradiation.

Conclusions
The p-CuO layers with the 1.5 eV band gap
energy and monoclinic
lattice, p-Cu2O layers with the 2.05 eV band gap energy
and cubic lattice, and bilayers consisting of both have been prepared
by controlling the potential in an aqueous solution containing copper(II)
sulfate hydrate and tartaric acid in the dark and under light irradiation.
The CuO layers were composed of granular grains on the FTO substrate
with and without the n-ZnO layer, irrespective of the light irradiation.
The isolated and coarse Cu2O grains were deposited sparsely
on the FTO substrate, but the insertion of the n-ZnO layer induced
the change to a continuous and dense layer, irrespective of the light
irradiation. The flat-band potential was estimated to be at almost
constant values of 0.149 V versus Ag/AgCl for CuO layers prepared
at 0.4 to 0.7 V and approximately −0.10 V for Cu2O layers prepared at −0.4 to −0.6 V. The 0.4 μm
CuO/1.1 μm Cu2O bilayers with characteristic grain
structures could be prepared by cathodic polarization at −0.4
V, followed by an anodic polarization at 0.4 V, irrespective of the
light irradiation. The electrodeposition of the Cu2O layer
on the CuO layer was strongly affected by the light irradiation and
continuous and defect-free 1.1 μm Cu2O/0.4 μm
CuO bilayers could be prepared by anodic polarization at 0.4 V, followed
by cathodic polarization at −0.4 V under the light irradiation.
The mechanism for the photoelectrodeposition of CuO/Cu2O and Cu2O/CuO bilayers was discussed based on the energy
band alignments drawn based on the flat-band potentials and applied
potentials for the electrodeposition. The results demonstrated here
reveals the ability to construct nanostructured oxide layers including
the bilayers and further multilayers.

Experimental Section
An aqueous solution containing
0.3 mol L–1 copper(II)
sulfate hydrate, 0.3 mol L–1 tartaric acid, and
1.5 mol L–1 sodium hydroxide was used for the electrodeposition
of CuO, Cu2O, and bilayers, respectively, with a solution
pH of 13.0. The electrodepositions were performed for CuO layers at
potentials of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 V and for Cu2O layers
at −0.4, −0.5, −0.6, and −0.7 V, respectively,
referenced to Ag/AgCl electrode for an electric charge of 1 C cm–2 with a Pt counter electrode using a polarization
system (Hokuto Denko, HSV-110) connected with a Coulomb meter (Hokuto
Denko, HF301), and the solution temperature was kept at 323 K. The
CuO/Cu2O and Cu2O/CuO bilayers were fabricated
by automatically switching the potential with the polarization system
in dark and under light irradiation. The light was irradiated from
the side of the glass substrate using a high-pressure mercury lamp
(USHIO, OPTICAL-MODULEX, 500 W) without any optical filter. The ZnO
layer was prepared by electrodeposition on the FTO substrate in an
aqueous solution containing 80 mmol L–1 zinc nitrate
hydrate at −0.8 V referenced to an Ag/AgCl electrode and 335
K for an electric charge of 0.5 C cm–2 using a potentiostat
(Hokuto Denko, HAL 3000) connected with a Coulomb meter (Hokuto Denko,
HF 301). The solution was prepared using reagent grade chemicals and
distilled water purified with Milli Pore Ellix-UV-Advantage. F:SnO2/soda-lime glass (FTO, AGC Fabritech, Co. Ltd., 10 Ω
sq–1) was used as the substrate. Prior to the electrodeposition,
the FTO substrates were degreased by anodic polarizations in a 1 mol
L–1 sodium hydroxide aqueous solution.

Cyclic
voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements were performed
using the polarization system (Hokuto Denko, HSV-110). The X-ray diffraction
patterns were recorded by a θ/2θ scanning technique with
monochromated Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 200 mA using
a Rigaku RINT2500. The optical absorption spectra were measured by
recording the absorbance using a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Hitachi, U4100) with an integrated sphere, and the bare substrate
was used as the reference. Electron microscopy observations were carried
out at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV using field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi, SU8000). An electrochemical
impedance measurement was performed in a 0.1 mol L–1 sodium sulfate aqueous solution at pH 6.0 at room temperature by
using VersaSTAT 3-100 (Princeton Applied Research), and Mott–Schottky
plots were drawn by using a VersaStudio software (Princeton Applied
Research).
