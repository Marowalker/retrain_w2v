Enzymes have been through millions
of years of evolution during
which their active-site microenvironments are fine-tuned. Active-site
residues are commonly conserved within protein families, indicating
their importance for substrate recognition and catalysis. In this
work, we systematically mutated active-site residues of l-threonine dehydrogenase from Thermoplasma volcanium and characterized the mutants against a panel of substrate analogs.
Our results demonstrate that only a subset of these residues plays
an essential role in substrate recognition and catalysis and that
the native enzyme activity can be further enhanced roughly 4.6-fold
by a single point mutation. Kinetic characterization of mutants on
substrate analogs shows that l-threonine dehydrogenase possesses
promiscuous activities toward other chemically similar compounds not
previously observed. Quantum chemical calculations on the hydride-donating
ability of these substrates also reveal that this enzyme did not evolve
to harness the intrinsic substrate reactivity for enzyme catalysis.
Our analysis provides insights into connections between the details
of enzyme active-site structure and specific function. These results
are directly applicable to rational enzyme design and engineering.

Introduction
Enzymes have active
sites where a myriad of functional groups conspire
to comprise unique environments that enable the catalysis of reactions
with unparalleled efficiency and specificity.1 In the past few decades, our ability to obtain molecular structures
of proteins and perform site-directed mutagenesis has generated valuable
insights into how enzymes carry out their functions at the atomic
level.2−5 These studies often focused on the role of catalytic residues that
perform the chemistry, including general acid/base, covalent, and
electrostatic contributions to catalysis.6,7 However,
studies that systematically address the contributions of all active-site
residues not directly involved in bond making and breaking are rare.5,8,9 In addition, these noncatalytic
amino acids are routinely assumed to be only important for facilitating
substrate binding. Some previous studies have shown that these residues
could be as essential to the enzyme’s function as catalytic
residues.8,9 The active-site microenvironment created
by amino acids not directly involved in bond making/breaking enables
enzymes to enhance catalysis through a variety of strategies, such
as introducing strain to destabilize the substrate and preorganizing
active-site dipoles for transition-state stabilization.10−13 Our understanding of how nature utilizes residues beyond those directly
involved in the reaction chemistry to enhance enzyme efficiency is
of paramount importance to enzyme engineering and design. Here, we
analyze the active-site residues in l-threonine dehydrogenase
to assess how they individually and collectively contribute toward
substrate binding and catalysis alongside previously recognized catalytic
residues. An improved understanding on this enzyme will also provide
a platform to develop novel biocatalysts that can perform selective
oxidation of β-amino alcohols to produce its activated carbonyl
products for synthetic applications.14,15

The
enzyme used in this work is l-threonine dehydrogenase
derived from Thermoplasma volcanium (tvTDH). This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of β-alcohol
on l-threonine to a ketone with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) serving as the oxidizing agent (Figure 1). This function is essential
to amino acid catabolism pathways, in which tvTDH initiates the degradation
of l-threonine by oxidizing it to 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate
that is subsequently deacetylated by ketobutyrate-CoA ligase to glycine.16 Extensive structural analysis of this enzyme
has been performed, resulting in multiple crystal structures with
various bound ligands (PDB IDs: 3AJR, 3A4V, 3A9W, and 3A1N).17 On the
basis of the structure with l-threonine bound (PDB ID: 3A9W), the reaction mechanism
of this enzyme is proposed to involve Y137, facilitating the deprotonation
of β-alcohol on l-threonine, followed by a hydride
transfer from β-carbon to the coenzyme NAD+ (Figure 1).17 The residue T112 is proposed to be responsible for stabilizing
the oxyanion intermediate.18 A previous
study characterized the activity of Y137F, a mutant that results in
the inactivation of this enzyme, consistent with the proposed mechanism.17

Figure 1 Schematic of the tvTDH reaction. l-Threonine
dehydrogenase
catalyzes the oxidation of β-alcohol to form 2-amino-3-oxobutanoic
acid with the reduction of NADH. The proposed reaction mechanism consists
of the deprotonation of the alcohol by the phenolate of Y137 with
T112 stabilizing the oxygen atom to form the ketone.

Although residues previously proposed to be directly
involved in
the reaction chemistry have been analyzed, the importance and role
of other residues within the active-site pocket remain elusive. In
this work, we systematically mutated seven amino acids that form the
reminder of the active-site residues interacting with l-threonine
into alanine to quantify the contribution of each side chain toward
the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. In addition, we characterized
substrate analogs of l-threonine, in which functional groups
of the substrate were systematically removed. This analysis of the
tvTDH active site enabled us to isolate the role of each individual
residue in the context of the proposed mechanism. These mechanistic
details improve our understanding of how this enzyme achieves function
and should advance our ability to rationally engineer enzymes.

Results
and Discussion
Identification of Relevant Active-Site Residues
The
crystal structure of tvTDH with NAD+ and l-threonine
bound (PDB ID: 3A9W) was used to identify residues that have direct contacts with the
substrate. All residues having any atoms situated within 6 Å
of l-threonine were considered, with the exception of the
previously proposed catalytic residues (Y137 and T112) and residues
making direct molecular interactions with NAD+ (defined
as within 4 Å of NAD+; Figure 2A).17 This analysis
resulted in the identification of seven residues that are primarily
interacting with l-threonine: S74, I113, G114, T178, T179,
D180, and W273 (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 Active-site analysis of tvTDH. (A) Zoom-in view of the active site
shows the molecular interactions between tvTDH and l-threonine.
The distances between the mutated residues (light brown) to the closest
atom on l-threonine are measured and represented with yellow-dotted
lines. Residues proposed to be involved in the reaction chemistry
are highlighted in green. l-Threonine is highlighted in light
purple. (B) Sequence logo of 64 diverse sequences that are homologous
to tvTDH. The regions surrounding the mutations tested are highlighted,
and their positions in the sequence are shown in bold.

Amino acid conservation analysis was performed
to assess the importance
of these seven positions within the tvTDH enzyme family. The crystal
structure of l-threonine dehydrogenase (PDB ID: 3A9W) was used as the
initial input to a Pfam19 search to identify
its protein family. The enzyme tvTDH is assigned to the NAD-dependent
epimerase/dehydratase family with 65846 sequence homologs residing
in the clan. To filter out redundant sequences, we processed the results
using CD-HIT20 with a sequence identity
cutoff of 80%. Sequences within 10% length of the tvTDH sequence were
kept for further analysis. After aligning the remaining sequences
using MUSCLE,21 they were further curated
to remove the proteins that do not possess the residues forming the
catalytic residues associated with this enzyme function. This series
of bioinformatics operations produced a final set of 64 genes for
analysis. An examination of the all-to-all sequence identity of these
64 sequences showed that this sequence set possesses overall sequence
identities ranging from 17 to 81% with an average of 36%. On the basis
of the multiple sequence alignment, the average sequence conservation
at each individual site for S74, I113, G114, T178, T179, D180, and
W273 is 89, 89, 60, 78, 74, 88, and 91%, respectively (Figure 2B, Table S1). The high level of evolutionary conservation observed for
these residues indicates that these residues are important for substrate
recognition or catalysis.

Effects of Alanine Mutations on the Activity
of l-Threonine
The site-directed alanine mutants
were generated using Kunkel mutagenesis.22 The sequence-verified plasmids generated were
transformed into Escherichia coli BLR(DE3)
for protein expression, and the proteins were produced through autoinduction
procedures. The mutant proteins were purified from the resulting cultures
with immobilized metal affinity chromatography, which made use of
the 6×-His tag that was engineered into the native tvTDH gene
(Figure S1, Document S1). On the basis of the quantification of the purified soluble
protein, we observed that protein yields for each of the alanine mutants
are within 2-fold of wild-type (WT) (Table S7). Once purified, each mutant was kinetically characterized to determine kcat, KM, and kcatKM–1 by measuring the accumulation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH) at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer.

The four S74A, T179A,
W273A, and D180A mutants decrease the catalytic efficiency by 228-,
413-, 1886-, and 60-fold relative to the native enzyme, respectively
(Figure 3, Table S2). For the mutants S74A, T179A, and W273A,
it is unclear whether the decrease in efficiency was due solely to KM or both kcat and KM, as no saturation kinetics are observed for
any of these mutants. S74 makes a hydrogen bond to the carboxylic
acid of threonine (Figure 2A). W273 occupies a large space in the active site with its
indole motif pointing toward the acid and alcohol functional groups
on the l-threonine substrate. On the basis of these observed
interactions, all of these residues are predicted to be important
in positioning the substrate in a catalytically productive orientation,
which is further supported by the deleterious effect on KM and kcatKM–1 of mutating them. D180 is located
5.1 Å from the amino group of the l-threonine substrate
(Figure 2A). Although
this distance is too far to be involved in a direct hydrogen bond,
it is well within the distance to have an impact on the substrate
through electrostatics or a water-bridged hydrogen bond. The removal
of this interaction results in a decrease in kcatKM–1 from
660 to 11 M–1 s–1, with a 5-fold
decrease in the turnover rate (kcat),
from 1.7 to 0.37 s–1 and a 16.5-fold increase in KM, from 2.6 to 43 mM. These observations are
consistent with the structure-based hypothesis that the electrostatic
effect of the acid is important in stabilizing the ligand in a catalytically
competent orientation. Using Eyring’s equation (Document S2), free-energy contributions were
estimated for S74A, T179A, W273A, and D180A; these estimates indicate
that these mutants decrease the catalytic efficiency by 3.2, 3.6,
4.5, and 2.5 kcal mol–1, respectively (Table S6).

Figure 3 Kinetic characterization. Characterization
of kinetic constants
of the WT enzyme and alanine mutants on a panel of substrate analogs.
The heat map represents the fold changes in kcat, KM, and kcatKM–1 each
mutant has on individual substrates relative to the WT enzyme. Orange
represents an improvement (i.e., increase in kcatKM–1 and kcat and decrease in KM) of at least 3-fold, and blue represents a decrease in kcatKM–1 and kcat and an increase in KM of at least 3-fold. N.D. indicates kcat, KM, or kcatKM–1 below
the limit of detection. Asterisk indicates samples that were assayed
in biological duplicates instead of triplicates.

The two mutants that were found to have a moderate impact
on the
catalytic efficiency are I113A, with a 6-fold decrease, and T178A,
with an 18-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency. I113 is observed
in the structure to be 4.2 Å from the β-carbon of l-threonine. Given the relatively weak binding associated with the
isolated noncovalent hydrophobic interactions, the change of only
6-fold associated with removing this interaction is not surprising.
Similarly, T179A is a second-shell mutant and is 2.8 Å from the
hydroxyl group of S74, which forms a hydrogen bond with the acid on
the l-threonine substrate.

The most unexpected result
from this study is associated with the
mutant G114A that enhances the catalytic efficiency. G114 is located
between the residues I113 and W273, with the Cα carbon being
5.3 Å from the β-alcohol of l-threonine. Mutating
G114 to alanine causes a 4-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency,
from 660 to 2700 M–1 s–1, which
breaks down to a 6% decrease in the turnover rate, from 1.7 to 1.6
s–1, and a 4.6-fold decrease in KM, from 2.6 to 0.6 mM. Although the backbone of this glycine
residue is too far to make any hydrogen bond or significant hydrophobic
interactions with the substrate, mutating this residue to alanine
in PyMOL leads to a distance of about 2.5 Å between the new methyl
group and the catalytic residue Y137 (Figure 2A). We hypothesize that this steric clash
between G114A and T137 will cause subtle structural rearrangements
of the surrounding residues. The 4.6-fold decrease in the observed KM suggests that this rearrangement could provide
an enhancement in binding of the ligand.

Effects of Mutations on
Kinetic Constants of Non-Native Substrates
Previous studies
have shown that this enzyme is highly specific
to l-threonine with no activity on l-serine, l-homoserine, 2-propanol, 1,4-butanediol, 2,3-butanediol, 1,2-propanediol,
ethanol, 1-butanol, d-threonine, dl-allo-threonine, and dl-threo-3-phenylserine.17 To further analyze the molecular interactions
essential for enzyme function, we characterized the kinetic constants
of our mutants against a panel of non-native substrates. These substrates
were chosen to systematically remove the functional groups of l-threonine to further elucidate whether each individual residue
had evolved to interact with a particular part of the l-threonine
substrate. The non-native substrates tested are l-serine,
(R)-(−)-1-amino-2-propanol, (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and l-threoninol (Figure 4). Our results show that, contrary
to previous reports, the WT enzyme is not completely specific to l-threonine and is active on two of the four tested substrates: l-serine and l-threoninol.17 The WT enzyme does not have activity on (R)-(−)-1-amino-2-propanol,
but one mutant, G114, was minimally active (Figure 4). No activity is observed with the native
enzyme or any mutant on (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.
However, consistent with previous reports, l-threonine is
the preferred substrate, with the four substrates tested here having
3900–760 000-fold lower catalytic efficiency than l-threonine (Figure 3, Tables S2–S5).

Figure 4 Substrate panel.
A series of commercially available substrates
each missing a functional group relative to l-theronine were
evaluated to determine the importance of each chemical group on the
catalytic efficiency.

Generally, the effect of mutation on l-threonine
was similar
to that on the non-natural substrate with a few notable exceptions.
S74A provides a hydrogen bond interaction to the acid motif on l-threonine. Although l-threoninol has an alcohol group
replacing the acid, S74 is expected to provide the same hydrogen bond
to the alcohol assuming that the crystal structure substrate conformation
was employed. Intriguingly, S74A increases the catalytic efficiency
by 4.5-fold, which is opposite to the 220-fold drop observed on l-threonine. The mutant T178A disrupts the hydrogen bond interaction
of the residue to the amino moiety on l-threonine and reduces
the catalytic efficiency by 413-fold with l-threonine (Figures S2–S5).

Intrinsic Substrate Reactivity
To further rationalize
the differences in enzyme activity for the substrates examined, we
evaluated their intrinsic hydride-donating abilities. The inherent
ability to donate a hydride (gauged by the free energy of the reaction
in Figure 5A) was calculated
for all five substrates (Figure 5B, Document S3) using Gaussian0923 at the Solvation Model based on Density (SMD)(water)-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)24−27 level of theory using the conformation of threonine observed to
be bound in the enzyme active site (Figure 2A; PDB ID: 3A9W). In this conformation, the ammonium
group is anti to the hydroxyl group in the side chain, and the two
moieties cannot form an internal hydrogen bond.

Figure 5 Quantum mechanical evaluation
of the intrinsic reactivity. (A)
Schematic of molecular transformation used to calculate the hydride
affinities for each substrate. (B) Absolute and relative hydride affinities
for each of the five substrates.

Using l-threonine as the reference point, our calculations
show that l-threoninol and l-serine are less willing
to donate a hydride ion, by 2.8 and 2.5 kcal mol–1, than is l-threonine (Figure 5B). By contrast, (R)-(−)-1-amino-2-propanol
and 3-hydroxybutyric acid are 2.2 and 10.8 kcal mol–,1 respectively, which are more willing to donate a hydride
to NAD+ than is l-threonine. These results, along
with our experimental kinetic constants, suggest that NAD+ oxidations of l-threoninol and (R)-3-hydroxybutyric
acid are chemically possible given a compatible active site, but the
inactivity of this enzyme on (R)-3-hydroxybutyric
acid is likely due to a suboptimal binding orientation. Overall, the
lack of a strong correlation between the hydride-donating ability
and the observed activity suggests that tvTDH did not evolve to harness
the intrinsic substrate reactivity for enzyme catalysis.

Conclusions
Our analysis of tvTDH and its active-site alanine mutants has revealed
that the active-site residues examined play varying roles in binding
and catalysis on primary and secondary alcohols. This systematic analysis
provides understanding of the key features that impart tvTDH enzyme
activity beyond the residues directly involved in the enzyme chemistry.
In addition, we have shown that this enzyme is capable of utilizing
a broader range of substrates than previously reported, albeit at
vastly lower levels of catalytic efficiency than observed for threonine.
The intricacies revealed here not only increase our fundamental understanding
of catalysis by threonine dehydrogenase but also set the stage for
future enzyme engineering efforts, in particular, those aimed at modulating
the activity to create libraries of redox enzymes capable of reducing
β-amino alcohols. Furthermore, systematic studies such as the
one presented here are essential for providing the data sets necessary
for training energy functions and sampling methods employed in enzyme
engineering algorithms.8

General Materials
l-Threonine (catalog #:
T8625), l-threoninol (catalog #: 469963), (R)-(−)-1-amino-2-propanol (catalog #: 238856), (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (catalog #: 238856), and l-serine
(catalog #: S4500) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. β-Nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide hydrate (catalog #: 124530050) was purchased
from Acros Organics. All other buffers and reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific. A 96-well plate for kinetic
assays was from Fisher Scientific (catalog# 07-200-842).

Mutagenesis,
Expression, and Purification of tvTDH
The gene encoding the l-threonine dehydrogenase derived
from tvTDH was codon-optimized and synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific
for expression in E. coli. Using Gibson
Assembly, it was cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites in pET29b+.
This encoded a C-terminal 6×-His tag to allow for affinity column
purification with cobalt resin. The mutagenesis was performed using
Kunkel mutagenesis to introduce the mutations in the tvDH gene on
Transcriptic using their standard protocol.

Sequence-verified
native and mutant plasmids were transformed into chemically competent E. coli BLR cells for protein expression. Protein
expressions were first observed with the inoculation of transformed
cells in 20 mL of growth media (50 μg/mL kanamycin in terrific
broth), which were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in 50 mL falcon tubes.
The turbid cultures were then centrifuged for 30 min at 4700 rpm.
The cell pellets were then resuspended in 20 mL of autoinduction media
containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL kanamycin, 1 mM MgSO4, 5052 and NPS from the standard autoinduction media protocol28), and proteins were allowed to express for 24
h shaking at 18 °C. The cultures were then harvested by centrifuging
for 30 min at 4700 rpm. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of lysis
buffer containing 1 mg lysozyme, 0.1 mg DNase, 200 μL BugBuster,
and 2 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and rocked for 30
min at 4 °C. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation
for 30 min at 15 000 rpm. Purification of the supernatant was
done with gravity column over 100 μL slurry of cobalt resin
and was washed with 5 mL of wash buffer that contains 50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) (pH 7), 200 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole. The protein
was eluted with 0.2 mL of elusion buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH
7), 200 mM NaCl, and 200 mM imidazole and was centrifuged at 1000
rpm for 1 min to extract the solution from the bead bed.

Kinetic Experiments
The activity of the WT and tvTDH
mutants was measured via the accumulation of NADH as a result of the
oxidation of the assayed substrates. The change in absorbance of NADH
was measured at a wavelength at 340 nm using BioTek Epoch and Synergy
microplate spectrophotometers on a 96-well nonbinding plate.

To establish the limit of detection for the assay, we grew and expressed
green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a negative control. We tested for
activity with GFP at the highest concentration for each substrate
to elucidate the error caused by detection limits and contamination.
There was no activity with GFP for l-threonine, l-serine, and l-threoninol but trace activity with (R)-3-amino propanol. We determined any activity on (R)-3-amino-propanol within 3-fold of the trace activity
observed to be inactive.

The assay of the WT and mutants on
the native substrate was performed
by a threefold serially diluted substrate in a 100 μL reaction
containing 10 mM NAD+, 200 mM glycine (pH 10), and 200
mM NaCl. The initial concentration for WT and each mutant was chosen
based on producing an accurate Michaelis–Menten curve (Figures S2–S5). The initial concentration
of the l-threonine activity assay for WT and T179A was 20
mM and was serially diluted threefold to obtain the various concentrations
tested. The initial concentration of l-threonine used for
I113A, W273A, D180A, and S74A was 100 mM and was serially diluted
threefold. The initial concentration of l-threonine for T178A
and G114A was 40 and 5 mM, respectively, and was serially diluted
threefold. The numbers reported are the average of three biological
replicates, and the error is the standard deviation between them.
The data that have an asterisk are calculated with biological duplicates.
The assay was performed at room temperature or 25 °C.

The
assay of the WT and mutants on non-native substrates l-serine, l-threoninol, and (R)-(−)-1-amino-2-propanol
was performed by a fourfold serially diluted substrate starting at
1 M concentration of the substrate in 100 μL reaction containing
200 mM glycine (pH 10), 200 mM NaCl, and 10 mM NAD+. The
enzymes were undiluted in all assays on non-native substrates.
