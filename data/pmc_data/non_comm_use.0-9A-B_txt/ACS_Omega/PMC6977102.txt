Despite widespread use as an immunosuppressant, the therapeutic
efficacy of the undecapeptide cyclosporine A (CyA) is compromised
when given by the oral route because of the innate hydrophobicity
of the drug molecule, potentially leading to poor aqueous solubility
and bioavailability. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize
nanofibers based on the water-miscible polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP), incorporating CyA preloaded into polymeric surfactants so as
to promote micelle formation on hydration; therefore, this approach
represents the novel combination of three dissolution enhancement
methodologies, namely solid dispersion technology, micellar systems,
and nanofibers with enhanced surface area. The preparation of the
nanofibers was performed in two steps. First, mixed micelles composed
of the water-soluble vitamin E derivative d-α-tocopheryl
poly(ethylene glycol) 1000 succinate and the amphiphilic triblock
polymer Pluronic F127 (Poloxamer 407) were prepared. The micelles
were characterized in terms of size, surface charge, drug loading,
and encapsulation efficiency using transmission electron microscopy,
dynamic light scattering, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
high-performance liquid chromatography, and scanning electron and
atomic force microscopy analysis. Nanofibers composed of PVP and the
drug-loaded surfactant system were then prepared via electrospinning,
with accompanying thermal, spectroscopic, and surface topological
analysis. Dissolution studies indicated an extremely rapid dissolution
profile for the fibers compared to the drug alone, while wettability
studies also indicated a marked decrease in contact angle compared
to the drug alone. Overall, the new approach appears to offer a viable
means for considerably improving the dissolution of the hydrophobic
peptide CyA, with associated implications for improved oral bioavailability.

1 Introduction
Cyclosporine A (CyA; Figure 1) is a cyclic undecapeptide,
originally derived from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, and is used extensively as
a therapeutic immunosuppressant because of its selective and reversible
inhibition of T-lymphocytes, accompanied by low cytotoxicity.1 More specifically, CyA is indicated for the treatment
of conditions such as allograft rejection in transplantation, autoimmune
diseases including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and dry eye
disease. However, the drug is classified as Biopharmaceutics Classification
System (BCS) class IV, with both low water solubility and membrane
permeability, hence adsorption following oral administration is a
major challenge because of both difficulties associated with transfer
to the aqueous phase (a prerequisite for absorption) as well as limitations
to subsequent transfer across the gastrointestinal wall. These absorption
characteristics are associated with the physicochemical characteristics
of the molecule, including high molecular weight (1203 kDa), low water
solubility (27.67 μg/mL at 25 °C) coupled with high lipophilicity
(log P = 2.92 at pH 7.4), and the very rigid cyclic
structure of the molecule which provides a further architectural barrier
to membrane permeation.2

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
CyA, vitamin E TPGS, Pluronic F127, and
PVP.

As a consequence of these absorption difficulties,
the first commercial
formulations of CyA (Sandimmune, approved in 1983) were emulsion-based,
either for intravenous (with Cremophor EL and ethanol) or oral administration
(in the form of soft gelatin capsules or an oral solution). These
formulations were in themselves problematic; for example, coadministration
of Cremophor EL is associated with a wide range of adverse effects,
including anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity reactions, and variation
in blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral neuropathy.1−4 Consequently, there has been considerable research into improving
CyA water miscibility and membrane permeability via a number of routes
and approaches,2−5 including the use of colloidal delivery systems including solid
lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, nanosuspensions, and micelles.3−6 Among these, polymeric micellar-based drug delivery system is considered
particularly promising and has been explored for ocular formulations,
allowing enhanced water miscibility without the need for inclusion
of an oily phase that would impede vision, while also enhancing permeability
across the cornea.7 However, for the oral
route, there is an additional challenge that solid dosage forms are
generally preferred.

Recently, significant attention has been
drawn to the possibility
of using nanofibers for oral delivery, particularly as the manufacture
of such systems at a scale commensurate with commercialization is
now possible.8 In addition, nanofibers
have been investigated as a means of enhancing delivery and uptake
of CyA into cells in vitro.8−10 Taken together, these studies
suggest that a suitable nanofiber-based formulation could potentially
achieve the twin goals of being the basis for a solid oral dosage
form while also improving dissolution and potentially uptake.

In this study, we investigate the possibility of combining micellar
and nanofiber delivery technologies as a means of enhancing, in the
first instance, the dissolution rate of the drug into relevant aqueous
media. This is a prerequisite to any enhancement of uptake because
of the necessity of any drug being in a molecular disperse form prior
to absorption. The ability of micellar systems to improve drug solubility
via incorporation into those regions of the structure that are dielectrically compatible is well
known. However, more recently, the possibility of using nanofibrous
systems as alternatives to matrix solid dispersions for the dissolution
enhancement of poorly water soluble drugs has been outlined;11 not only may the fibers act as solid dispersions
to present the drug to the aqueous media in a molecularly disperse
form within a water-miscible base but the high surface area of the
fibers further enhances the dissolution rate from the solid surface.
Here, we propose to incorporate the CyA into micelles that are themselves
incorporated into nanofibers, thereby providing a novel approach for
dissolution enhancement combining micellar, nanofiber, and solid dispersion
technologies.

We examine the use of d-α-tocopheryl
polyethylene
glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS, Figure 1), an amphiphilic nonionic water-soluble derivative
of vitamin E formed by conjugation of vitamin E succinate with polyethylene
glycol (PEG). TPGS has generally regarded as safe (GRAS) status and
is an FDA-approved pharmaceutical excipient; notably, it offers numerous
advantageous features including solubilization of hydrophobic drugs,
enhanced cellular uptake of the drug payload, and inhibition of P-glycoprotein
to prevent drug efflux.13 However, it also
has a relatively high critical micelle concentration (cmc) of circa
0.02% w/w, rendering TPGS micelles prone to dissociation on dilution,
thereby potentially losing the solubilization advantage in the gastrointestinal
tract. Consequently, generating mixed or composite structures with
another copolymeric material with a suitable cmc value represents
a means of overcoming this difficulty. In order to achieve this, we
explore the use of Pluronic F127 (henceforth referred to as F127)
triblock copolymers, consisting of hydrophilic polyethylene oxide
(PEO) and hydrophobic polypropylene oxide (PPO) segments arranged
in a triblock structure (PEO100–PPO65–PEO100; Figure 1) with relatively
extended PEO blocks. This material is commonly used as a low-cmc micellar
carrier (0.0031%, w/w12,13) while also having high biocompatibility
and an acceptable safety profile and solubilization capacity. F127
has little effect on P-glycoprotein and does not significantly enhance
membrane transport because of its relatively hydrophilic nature.

Our proposal is that by combining TPGS and F127 in mixed micelles,
we will generate a carrier system that is suitable for CyA from both
a loading and a delivery perspective, while subsequent incorporation
into nanofibers composed of the water-miscible polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP)14 (Figure 1) will generate a highly hydrophilic system
that not only offers a high surface area for dissolution but may also
be further processed into a solid dosage form for oral delivery (this
polymer being a common component of a range of oral dosage forms).
In the first instance, the solubility of CyA in different Pluronic
F127/TPGS ratios and concentrations was established, followed by characterization
of the drug-loaded micelles in terms of particle size, zeta potential,
morphology, encapsulation, and surface morphology. The micellar formulation
was then loaded into PVP nanofibers and the product characterized
in terms of physicochemical properties, in vitro release, and wettability
studies. In this manner, the possibility of using micelle-forming
nanofibers as the potential carrier system for CyA may be effectively
evaluated.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
CyA (C62H111N11O12, m.wt. 1.2 kDa) was procured
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, UK. TPGS (m.wt. 574.874 g/mol), pyrene
(m.wt. 202.25 g/mol), and Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic F127 m.wt. 12 500
g/mol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich UK. PVP (high m.wt. 146 000–186 000)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK. Coumarin-6 was procured from
Sigma-Aldrich UK. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) tablets biotech
grade E404 (VWR Life Science, UK) were used to prepare the pH 7.4
and 6.8 buffer solutions. The solvents including Milli-Q water and
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade chemicals were
all of analytical grade.

2.2 Development of the HPLC-Based CyA Detection
Method
The quantification of CyA was performed utilizing
an HPLC-UV system with a Zorbax Eclipse Plus reverse phase C-18 column
(dimension 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) (Agilent Technologies Santa
Clara, USA), thermostated at 68 °C. The mobile phase used was
an 80:20 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and HPLC grade water using
a flow rate of 1 mL/min.15 The injection
volume used was 20 μL, and absorbance was monitored at 210 nm.
The calibration curve was constructed over a concentration range of
0.5–250 μg/mL with an R2 value
of 0.998 (Figure S1).

2.3 CyA Equilibrium Solubility Studies
In order to evaluate the drug solubility, the CyA was dissolved in
ethanol and the solution added in excess to the aqueous systems under
study. The mixed systems were incubated to allow equilibration and
the ethanol evaporated so that any excess CyA not incorporated into
the aqueous solvent system (including the micelles) would precipitate
and be filtered out. To ensure ethanol evaporation over the incubation
period, pierced aluminum foil was used as a covering for the reaction
container. The CyA content was the measured using the HPLC method
described above. More specifically, a 1 mg/mL ethanolic solution of
CyA was added to the range of molar concentrations (0.0005–10
mM) of surfactant mixture (F127/TPGS; 3:2 molar ratio) in aqueous
solution and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C at 100 rpm. The F127/TPGS
3:2 molar ratio was chosen based on literature precedent,12,13 as well as initial solubilization studies (see below), and was used
throughout the study unless otherwise indicated. The suspension was
then filtered (0.45 μm Millipore membrane filter), and the filtrate
was diluted in acetonitrile and analyzed using the HPLC-UV system.
Furthermore, the intrinsic solubility of CyA in PBS alone (pH 7.4),
30% (v/v) PBS in ethanol and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80 in PBS were also
evaluated under the same incubation conditions for a period of 72
h.

2.4 cmc Determination
In order to evaluate
the cmc of the mixed micellar systems, pyrene was used as a hydrophobic
fluorescence probe.13 Pyrene solution (500
μL) in acetone (0.6 μM) was added to the mixed micelle
solutions (0.0005–0.1 mM) and mixed for 4–5 h followed
by overnight incubation at ambient temperature; the acetone was evaporated
during this process. Samples were measured for fluorescence emission
using a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer, with the pyrene
excitation wavelength being 334 nm. The ratio of first to third order
emission band peak of pyrene (I372/I383) was plotted against the molar concentration
of surfactant mixture (F127/TPGS). A range of molar ratios of the
two surfactants (1:1, 1:4, 4:1, and 3:2) were evaluated; the 3:2 F127/TPGS
molar ratio was used for subsequent studies.

2.5 Preparation of CyA-Loaded TPGS/F127 Mixed
Micelles
For the preparation of the unloaded micelles following
an established method,16 10 mM solutions
of F127 and TPGS were mixed in a 3:2 molar ratio (F127/TPGS) followed
by homogenization for 30 min using a D1 18 disperser (IKA, UK). The
micellar dispersions were freeze-dried and the powder reconstituted
so as to provide a standardized starting material for drug incorporation.
Samples (2–50 mg) were reconstituted in 5 mL aqueous solution
under stirring, and an ethanolic solution (1 mg/mL) of the drug was
added in a dropwise manner followed by homogenization for 30 min.
After homogenization, the sample was stirred overnight to allow equilibration
and to ensure complete evaporation of ethanol. The system was subjected
to dialysis [using molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) 3.5 kDa dialysis
membrane] over a period of 48 h followed by filtration using a 0.45
μm Millipore membrane filter to remove any excess drug. The
following w/w drug to (dried material) micelle ratios were prepared:
1:50 (F1), 1:30 (F2), 1:20 (F3), 1:10 (F4), 1:05 (F5), and 1:02 (F6);
the F5 ratio was used for subsequent studies.

2.6 Evaluation of Drug-Loading Content and Entrapment
Efficiency
In order to investigate the drug-loading content
(LC) and encapsulation efficiency of the mixed (F127/TPGS) micelles,
lyophilized systems were used. The micellar solutions were frozen
at −75 °C followed by freeze-drying for at least 24 h.
The mixed micelles were weighed (2–50 mg) and reconstituted
in 5 mL water followed by addition of 1 mL of an ethanolic solution
of drug (1 mg/mL solution) into the micellar dispersion. The solutions
were sonicated for 30 min followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C
under 100 rpm stirring conditions. The solutions were then dialyzed
using a 3.5 kDa dialysis membrane against distilled water for 48 h,
followed by further filtration (0.45 μm Millipore membrane filter)
to allow removal of excess unloaded drug. The filtrate was diluted
in acetonitrile to dissolve the micellar system and to release all
the encapsulated drug; the product was then analyzed using the HPLC-UV
system in order to evaluate the LC and EE of the micellar systems.
The LC was calculated from the weight of CyA extracted from micelles/total
weight of micelles added, while the EE was calculated from the weight
of CyA extracted from micelles/weight of input CyA.    where the mass of input CyA is the mass of
CyA used for preparation of micelles.

2.7 Characterization of CyA-Loaded Mixed Micelles
and Micelle-Loaded Nanofibers
2.7.1 Assessment of Micelle Size, Polydispersity
Index, and Surface Charge
A Zetasizer Nano instrument (Malvern
Instruments, Malvern, UK) equipped with a 4 mW He–Ne laser
(633 nm) was employed to measure the mean hydrodynamic particle size
and size distribution of the unloaded and CyA-loaded formulations
(F5) and electrokinetic zeta potential at 25 °C. All samples
were evaluated in triplicate.

2.7.2 Morphological and Elemental Analysis of
Polymeric Micelles and Nanofibers
For transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) studies, diluted micellar systems were drop-casted
on to copper grids and stained with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid
and further air-dried before observation using a Philips/FEI CM120
BioTwin microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV to
avoid any interference due to water. For nanofiber analysis, a copper
grid was held directly over the aluminum foil inside the electrospinning
chamber, and fibers were deposited for 5 min to ensure that a thin
film was deposited for examination by TEM.

The surface morphology
of the micelle-loaded electrospun fiber mats was investigated using
a Jeol JSM-6480LV high-performance variable pressure analytical scanning
electron microscope with a resolution of 3.0 nm, along with an energy-dispersive
system and electron backscatter diffraction facilities, operated with
an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a working distance of 20 mm. A
small piece of the nanofiber mat was fixed on a conductive carbon
tape and mounted on the support and then sputtered with an approximately
6 nm layer of gold (Au) for 60 s with a sputter-coating unit (Bio-Rad,
Polaron Division Gold Coating System). The diameter distributions
of the nanofibers in the mats were determined with an ImageJ tool
with sample sizes of at least 50 fibers per scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) micrograph. Statistical analysis was performed with OriginPro
8 software. The instrument was equipped with an energy dispersive
spectrometer to confirm the presence of drug within the CyA/micellar-loaded
nanofibers.

2.7.3 Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transforms
Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and Differential Scanning
Calorimetry Analysis
The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR,
Bruker VERTEX 70 FTIR spectrometer) spectra of pure CyA drug powder,
pure polymers (TPGS, F127, and PVP), freeze-dried unloaded mixed micelles,
and CyA loaded micelles were recorded over the 400–4000 cm–1 range.

X-ray diffraction [XRD, Rigaku Mini
600 (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan)] was performed to study the physical form
of the pure components, the freeze-dried micellar formulations, and
the micelle-incorporated nanofibrous systems. The XRD was operated
with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 15 mA), between
2 and 40° over 2θ at 2°/min speed and 0.02 step size
at constant temperature 25 °C, with constant voltage and current
intensity. Xpert data viewer software (PANalytical B.V., Netherland)
was used to analyze the data. Modulated temperature differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) (TA Instruments Q1000, UK) was used to characterize
the lyophilized micellar and micelle-loaded nanofiber samples. The
micelles were placed in hermetically sealed aluminum pans and purged
with 150 mL/min of nitrogen. The system was calibrated with indium,
and a heating rate of 2°/min from 20 to 250 °C was used.
Data analysis was performed using TA Universal Analysis software.

2.8 Electrospinning Parameters and Nanofiber Characterization
A Spraybase electrospinning system (Spraybase Instruments, Avectas,
Ireland) was used for fabrication of nanofibers loaded with CyA-containing
micelles. The nanofibers were prepared via single-nozzle electrospinning.
PVP (25 wt %) was dissolved in double distilled water for spinning
the unloaded and loaded nanofibers. CyA-loaded micelles (50 wt % freeze
dried material suspended water) were mixed in a 60:40 v/v ratio (PVP/surfactant
mixture) to obtain homogeneous solutions before electrospinning the
loaded systems. These proportions were selected after extensive preliminary
studies to both maximize drug loading and to produce good quality
fibers. Note that the final composition of the dried fibers was as
follows: a 100 mL spraying solution would theoretically produce 15
g of PVP and 20 g of surfactant/drug mix, in which the surfactants
would be present in a 3:2 F127/TPGS molar ratio, and the drug was
present in a weight ratio of 1:5 (CyA to surfactant). This in turns
equates to 9.52% w/w theoretical drug loading in the dry fibers, which
is a realistically high loading for a practical dosage form. The electrospinning
parameters were as follows: distance between electrodes tip to collector
20–22 cm, applied voltage 18–24 kV, relative humidity
30–46%; the temperature was kept at 25 °C throughout the
fabrication process. The morphology of the nanofibers was assessed
by SEM, followed by ImageJ image analysis. Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) (Bruker’s MultiMode 8 and JPK NanoWizard) was performed
in peak-force tapping mode on thin layers of fibers deposited onto
a mica surface.

2.9 Fluorescence Microscopy Examination of Micelle
Incorporation into Nanofibers
Coumarin-6 was used as a hydrophobic
fluorescence probe to examine the incorporation of micelles into the
nanofibrous systems. The coumarin-6-loaded micelles were prepared
in a similar manner to the drug-loaded micelles, with the excess coumarin-6
removed by dialysis (MWCO = 3.5 kDa) of the system for 48 h in distilled
water under standard stirring conditions. The coumarin-6-loaded micelles
were then blended with the aqueous solution of PVP and stirred until
a homogeneous solution was obtained. The solution was then electrospun
following optimized parameters: 24 kV voltage, 40% (measured) humidity,
and 20 cm distance from tip to collector.

2.10 In Vitro Release Study of CyA-Loaded Micelles
from Micelle-Encapsulated Nanofibers
The release of CyA from
the loaded nanofibers was examined in a range of pH media (1.2 pH
0.1 N HCl, 6.8 and 7.4 pH PBS buffer). The loaded nanofiber mats were
cut into circa 10 mg samples, with each experiment run in triplicate.
The release study was performed at 37 °C at 100 rpm (shaking
speed) in an orbital incubator shaker (SciQuip Incu Shaker MINI, UK).
The nanofibers were then placed in the three dissolution media (sink
conditions), and the amount of drug released was estimated at various
time points up to 20 min. The drug content was measured by dilution
in acetonitrile followed by HPLC-UV analysis as described above. The
release of the drug from the nanofiber samples was compared to the
release profile of the pure drug.

2.11 Contact Angle Measurement
The static
contact angles on the drug and nanofiber mat surfaces were calculated
using the sessile drop method with a drop shape analysis system-DSA10
(DSA10-Kruss, Hamburg, Germany). Deionized water (40 μL) was
dropped on top of a nanofiber mat sample, and the contact angle was
measured after 60 s equilibration time.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Incorporation of CyA into Polymeric Mixed
Micelles
3.1.1 cmc Determination of Micelles and CyA Solubility
Studies
The cmc values of F127/TPGS mixed micelles containing
1:1, 1:4, 4:1, and 3:2 compositional ratios (molar ratios of F127
to TPGS) were determined using the fluorescent probe pyrene that enters
the hydrophobic core on formation of the micelles, thereby resulting
in a decrease in the (I372/I383) fluorescence intensity ratio. The typical complete
fluorescence spectra of pyrene (0.6 μM) alone and in mixed micelle
suspension showed the distinct emission spectral regions of pyrene
including I1 (372), I2 (380), I3 (383), I4 (391), and I5 (395)
as shown in Figure S2a; a plot of the fluorescence
emission of pyrene at the I372/I383 ratio in the presence of various concentrations
(0.0005–0.1 mM) of copolymers F127/TPGS (3:2 molar ratio) is
shown in Figure S2b. In the absence of
micelles (i.e., below the cmc), the ratio of first/third emission
peaks (I1/I3) was high because of the pyrene being located in a polar environment.
In contrast, the presence of micelles caused a decrease in the I1/I3 emission peak
ratio because of solubilization of the pyrene into the hydrophobic
core of micelles, in turn leading to a reduction in the I1/I3 intensity ratio.17 The cmc values are given in Table S1. The results showed that the mixed polymeric micelles
in the 3:2 and 4:1 ratios had lower cmc than the pure polymers TPGS
and F123 (4:0; 0:4 ratios). The properties of these mixed micellar
systems have been previously studied by Butt et al.12 who suggested that the presence of the TPGS may increase
the stability of the hydrophobic core, particularly via interactions
with the PPO moieties of the Poloxamer. These authors also suggested
that such interactions may provide a more favorable environment for
hydrophobic drug incorporation, hence the 3:2 ratio was chosen on
the basis of both the stability of the micelles, as indicated by the
cmc value, as well as the potential for drug incorporation.

In order to provide a baseline for comparison of solubility values
for CyA, studies were conducted on the solubility of the drug in a
range of solvents as indicated in Table S2. The solubility in water was found to be in good agreement with
previously published values (1). The presence of the surfactants above
the cmc clearly had a profound effect on the drug solubility, which
may be considered to be a positive indication of the propensity for
these systems to incorporate the drug.

3.1.2 Measurement of Drug Loading into Micelles
The drug loading and entrapment efficiencies of CyA using different
weight ratios of drug to mixed micelles were determined. As shown
in Figure 2, as the
ratio of drug to micellar content increased (with the drug content
being kept constant) from F1 to F6, the entrapment efficiency decreases.
This is to be expected as the EE reflects the absolute amount of the
drug that is able to be incorporated, hence as the relative drug loading
increases (and the surfactant content decreases), the efficiency of
entrapment decreases even though the absolute amount of drug increases.
At the other extreme, when the ratio of drug to surfactant is very
high (F6), the amount loaded will be lower as there is insufficient
surfactant present to incorporate the drug effectively (hence a low
EE and LC). The F5 (1:5 drug to surfactant ratio) reflects a reasonable
compromise between effective incorporation while also maintaining
low-surfactant concentration, in turn maximizing the loading in the
final dosage form as well as reducing the possibility of issues with
irritation or toxicity. This ratio (F5) was therefore used for further
studies.

(weight kept constant at 1 mg) as a function of various weight ratios
of mixed micelles composed of surfactant mixture F127/TPGS (3:2 molar
ratio).

3.2 Micellar Morphological, Structural, and Thermal
Studies
3.2.1 Transmission Electron Microscopy and Dynamic
Light Scattering
In order to confirm the size, shape, and
homogeneity of the micelles, TEM analysis of unloaded (3:2 F127/TPGS
molar ratio) and loaded (F5 ratio of drug to micellar material) samples
was performed. TEM micrographic images confirmed that spherical micelles
were generated (Figure 3Ia,IIa). Further analysis by ImageJ and the corresponding histogram
plots showed that the average size of the empty micelles was in the
region of 22.33 nm (Figure 3Ia), while a significant increase in size was seen for drug-loaded
micelles (in the range 100–200 nm; Figure 3IIa); micelles of similar size have been
reported previously.18,19 More specifically, the size of
the CyA-loaded micelles (F5) formulation was measured as 137 ±
7 nm (Figure 3I,IIb).
Typically, a nonpolar drug would become incorporated into the hydrophobic
core of the micelle, leading to an increase in the core size and aggregation
number,20 hence the significant increase
in size for the CyA-loaded micelles is in accordance with previous
observations. The TEM images further indicate differences in diffraction
contrast for the unloaded and drug-loaded micelles, reflecting differences
in the thickness and composition of the samples.21

F127/TPGS (3:2) micellar systems. (a) TEM micrographs; (b) corresponding
size distribution histograms (where A.D. = average diameter and S.D.
= standard deviation); (c) DLS-based histogram with a mean average
hydrodynamic size of empty micelles 68 nm and CyA-loaded micelles
180.0 nm; (d) corresponding zeta potentials with means of −3.26
and −8.7 mV, respectively.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies of empty
and drug-loaded
micelles yielded an average hydrodynamic size of 68 ± 13 nm [polydispersity
index (PDI) 0.167 (Figure 3I,IIc,d)] and 180 ± 76 nm (PDI 0.093), which was somewhat
higher than the TEM determination but of the same order of magnitude;
this may be a function of the low zeta potential what may have led
to some degree of aggregation in the suspension prepared for the DLS
studies. The PDI values are low (less than 0.2), which indicates that
both populations were relatively homogeneous,22 although at the lower size range, the unloaded samples did show
a bimodal distribution, possibly reflecting an element of kinetic
micellar growth.23 Furthermore, the dilution
and sonication stages required to reduce aggregation for the DLS studies
may also have contributed to this low value. An increase in overall
negative charge was observed on addition of the drug, with the electrokinetic
zeta potential value increasing from −3.26 to −8.7 mV.

3.2.2 Elemental Mapping and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectrometry Analysis
X-ray-based elemental mapping
is a useful technique for the identification of chemical components
present in nanocarriers;24 here the technique
was used to study freeze-dried samples so as to allow assessment of
the chemical composition of the unloaded and CyA-loaded systems. In
order to confirm the successful incorporation and dispersion of the
drug payload within the micelle, elemental mapping (Figure 4i,ii) and point energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analysis (Figure 4iii) were performed. As the polymers (TPGS,
F127) used for synthesis of the micelles were devoid of any nitrogen
elements, the elemental mapping images for the unloaded systems solely
indicated the presence of C and O (Figure 4ia–d). In contrast, the CyA drug molecule
contains a significant molecular nitrogen component (C62H11N11O12).

(no nitrogen peak detected) and (b) CyA-loaded mixed micelles (nitrogen

% information (iii a,b), respectively.

The elemental map of the CyA-loaded micelles clearly
indicated
the presence of N (Figure 4iia–e). Furthermore, the point EDS for the unloaded
micelles further confirmed the absence of the N peak in the spectrum,
with elemental recordings of C 64.51% and O 35.49 wt %, respectively,
as shown in the inset table (Figure 4iiia; see inset table). In contrast, 13.81 wt % N was
found for the CyA-loaded micellar samples (Figure 4iiib; see inset table).

3.2.3 FTIR Spectra of CyA and Drug-Loaded Micelles
FTIR was performed to obtain further insight into the presence
and possible interaction between CyA and the constituent micellar
surfactants. The representative peaks of CyA were observed from 2600
to 4000 cm–1, corresponding to the −alkyl
group (nCH, ∼2850–2950 cm–1) and N–H primary and secondary amine (∼3200–3600
cm–1) stretching modes (Figure 5; Table S3). In
addition, the distinctive amine C–N stretching band was observed
in the region of ∼1020–1300 cm–1,
and the absorption bands at 1630–1680 cm–1 related to amide groups within the molecule.25

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of CyA and F127/TPGS (3:2)-loaded micelles; peaks
inside the dotted circle show peak changes highlighted in the text
(a) expanded region 1750–1000 cm–1 and (b)
expanded region 3600–2500 cm–1.

On incorporation of the CyA into micelles, changes
in the characteristic
spectra were observed although it has to be considered that the CyA
peaks will not only be obscured by the presence of the F127 and TPGS
but will also be of lower intensity given that the drug is a minor
component of the system. More specifically, the peaks corresponding
to the TPGS carbonyl band were detected at 1739 cm–1 while the backbone C–H stretching bonds are centered at 2949
and 2867 cm–1. The 3400–3650 cm–1 peaks were because of the terminal OH group, while the peak at 1045–1295
cm–1 is attributed to C–O stretching. Of
these, the absorption bands from 1105 to 1242 cm–1 are attributed to the characteristic C–O–C stretching
vibrations of the repeated −OCH2CH2 units
of TPGS.26 The characteristic spectra of
F127 showed the absorption peaks at 2884 cm–1 (C–H,
stretch, aliphatic), 1342 cm–1 (in-plane O–H
bend), and 1111 cm–1 (C–O stretch).27

Figure 5 shows the
changes in spectra for the two characteristic regions. As mentioned
above, direct comparisons with the spectrum of CyA alone may have
limitations, but even so, it is of interest to note the changes in
the peak position and breadth which may indicate some degree of molecular
interaction with the surfactants. In the 1750–1000 cm–1 spectral region of CyA (Figure 5a), an amide peak shift from 1630 to 1625 cm–1 was observed on loading into micelles, raising the possibility of
a hydrogen bonding interaction between the surfactants and the amide
group of CyA, supported by the peak broadening observed as well as
the change in wavenumber.28,29 A further effect was
observed in spectral region 1080–1300 cm–1 with the disappearance of the 1295 and 1265 cm–1 amine peaks of CyA and observation of a new broad peak at 1280 cm–1. Figure 5b shows a similar alteration of the amine and alkyl group
peaks in the 3300–2800 cm–1 regions. Overall,
therefore, there is evidence to suggest an interaction between the
CyA and the surfactants within the micelles; this suggestion is compatible
with the marked solubilization effects noted for this mixed micelle
system.

3.2.4 XRD and DSC Analysis of Freeze-Dried Drug-Loaded
Micelles
The freeze-dried CyA-loaded micelles were characterized
by XRD and DSC. XRD analysis enabled identification of the crystalline
or amorphous state of CyA in the freeze-dried micellar polymeric dispersion.
Diffraction patterns of pure TPGS, F127, and CyA were used as references
for the evaluation of various micellar nanoformulations. Reference
spectra indicated that CyA existed in a crystalline state before incorporation
into the micellar formulations (Figure 6ia); the diffractogram of raw CyA powder showed characteristic
high-intensity diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 6.86°
(011), 7.8° (102), 9.26° (110), 10.76° (112), 12.58°
(022), 14.48° (201), 15.04° (202), 15.2° (210), 16.78°
(124), 18.6° (131), 19.38° (132), 20.84° (027), 22.14°
(230), 23.28° (042), and 24.28° (119).30,31 Pure F127 also showed two characteristic peaks with the highest
intensity at 2θ angles 19.13 and 23.32°, indicating that
F127 is a crystalline adjuvant.32 The characteristic
peaks 18.12 and 22.32° of TPGS were observed in the diffraction
pattern of TPGS.33 The XRD patterns of
the polymeric-mixed micelles (F127 and TPGS) and micelles loaded with
CyA displayed similar peak locations in XRD patterns, with no obvious
peak broadening observed (Figure 6ib). However, the diffraction patterns present in the
crystalline drug were absent in the micelles, indicating that the
drug was molecularly dispersed in the freeze-dried material. Further
incorporation of drug loaded micelles into the amorphous PVP polymer
(described in more detail below) showed the micelle-loaded PVP nanofibers
to also show no evidence for crystallinity (Figure 6ic).

DSC data showing transitions for CyA in comparison to formulated systems.

These findings were further confirmed by DSC analysis
in that the
pure CyA showed typical endothermic peaks at 111 and 122 °C,7,30 corresponding to the melting points of the drug, thus reflecting
its crystalline nature. Pure PVP showed a broad endothermic peak with
an onset of 50 °C, attributed to the release of absorbed water.34 F127 and TPGS 1000 exhibit sharp endothermic
melting peaks at Tm of 57.28 and 39.76
°C, respectively, corresponding to the melting of PEG chains
(Figure 6iia). The Tm peaks of CyA were absent in the drug-loaded
micelles (and nanofiber based solid dosage form) (Figure 6iib,c), whereas all the peaks
corresponding to the unloaded polymeric micelles were present, indicating
again that CyA was molecularly dispersed within the micelles.

3.3 Fabrication and Characterization of Surfactant/Drug-Loaded
Nanofibers
3.3.1 Morphology and Size Analysis of Nanofibers
by SEM, TEM, and AFM
Unloaded PVP nanofibers and fibers incorporating
the freeze-dried CyA/surfactant material were electrospun as outlined
in section 2.8. The
morphologies were examined using SEM (Figure 7a–d) combined with ImageJ analysis.
SEM clearly showed the formation of smooth, beadless nanofibers for
both the unloaded and loaded systems. Size reduction was observed
on loading, with the PVP fibers having a mean diameter of 860 ±
195 nm (Figure 7a,c),
while the loaded systems had a mean average diameter of 292 ±
97 nm (Figure 7b,d).
A possible reason for this significant size reduction is the high
proportion of surfactant present which would inevitably decrease the
surface tension, one of the most critical factors contributing to
nanofabrication.35 More specifically, the
surface tension needs to be overcome by the electrical forces which
act upon the polymer solution, leading to fine jet ejection from the
nozzle, while the lower surface tension will also facilitate greater
fiber stretching, enabling the formation of thinner fibers.

plot showing average fiber diameter, (c) CyA/surfactant-loaded composite
(F5) nanofibers, and (d) corresponding size histogram (where, S.D.
= standard deviation; A.D. = average diameter).

In order to investigate the topography further,
AFM in peak force
tapping mode was utilized. Topographic images of the unloaded (Figure 8a) and loaded nanofibers
(Figure 8b) are shown;
interestingly, for the latter, there is some evidence of small distinct
structures that we tentatively ascribe to small deposits of drug,
given the issues that may be evident with incorporation into a nonhydrated,
relatively hydrophilic matrix, although more work would be required
to ascertain this for certain. The height distributions for the two
sets of nanofibers, measured using an AFM depth histogram, are given
in Figure S3.

Figure 8 AFM topographic image
showing (a) PVP nanofibers and (b) CyA/surfactant-loaded
nanofibers; the height scale is included for the two images and a
height distribution analysis given in Figure S3.

Fluorescence-based methods were used to further
validate the successful
incorporation of micelles into the nanofibers. Coumarin-6, a hydrophobic
fluorescence dye, was selected as a surrogate for the CyA; it was
observed that the nanofibers incorporating micelles loaded with coumarin-6
showed bright green fluorescence under the green fluorescence protein
filter compared to the control nanofibers which showed no fluorescence
signal, confirming the successful incorporation of micelles into the
nanofibers (Figure S4a,c;b,d).

3.4 Release Profile and Wettability Analysis of
CyA/Micelle-Loaded Nanofibers
3.4.1 In Vitro Drug Release Study
Drug
solubility is an equilibrium measure but is a key determinant of the
dissolution rate, itself an indication of absorption for many drugs
including CyA, hence a central objective of the current work is to
determine the dissolution profile of the nanofiber formulations compared
to the drug alone. For dissolution testing under sink conditions (for
the nanofiber systems), samples equivalent to 200 μg of CyA
were used. Drug release profiles for the CyA/micelle incorporated
nanofibers (F5) were compared with those from the corresponding quantity
of pure crystalline CyA (Figure 9). After 14 min, drug release from the nanofiber was
found to be complete, whereas there was negligible dissolution from
the pure drug. The remarkable improvement in the dissolution rate
for CyA via incorporation into nanofibers can be ascribed to a number
of mechanisms; these include solubilization, high surface area, improved
wetting, and molecular dispersion of the drug. Irrespective of the
mechanism, it is clear that there is a significant dissolution advantage
for the nanofiber system. A range of mathematical models have been
applied to the data, and these are summarized in Table S4; while good fits were noted the complexity and multiplicity
of the mechanisms involved in the dissolution from the mixed surfactant/polymer
system do render such analyses of limited value, and hence they are
included for completeness rather than because they necessary lend
insights into the processes involved. Nevertheless, at this early
stage of the development of this technology, these results are highly
encouraging in relation to the possibility of improved in vivo bioavailability,
given that for BCS class II and quite possibly class IV drugs, an
enhancement in dissolution may be expected to result in a more rapid
uptake into the bloodstream when dissolution in the gastrointestinal
tract is the rate-limiting step to absorption.

Figure 9 Dissolution profiles
of CyA from CyA/micelle-loaded nanofibers
at different pH values (1.2, 0.1 N HCl, 6.8, PBS, and 7.4, PBS) in
comparison to the drug alone. The release for the nanofibrous systems
after 14 min represents complete dissolution of the 200 μg of
CyA.

3.4.2 Contact Angle Analysis
As mentioned
above, the purpose of this study was to examine whether a combination
of micellar, nanofiber, and solid dispersion technologies could provide
a novel means of significantly enhancing dissolution and by implication
bioavailability. The dissolution data would certainly support the
approach; however there may be a number of mechanisms involved including
surface area, drug dispersion, solubilization effects, and wetting
effects. While it is likely that all of these are contributing, we
have explored the first three of these factors in the preceding study
and have noted that all three may be positively influenced by our
formulation approach. However, it is well known that wettability may
also be a major determinant in dissolution of pharmaceuticals,36 hence in order to explore whether the wettability
may also play a role, we perform a study to establish whether the
contact angle may be reduced via formulation into the nanofibers.

It was observed that CyA presents a contact angle of 113°, reflecting
its highly hydrophobic nature, in contrast to the negligible contact
angle shown by PVP (Figure 10). Incorporation of CyA into the micelles leads to an increase
in contact angle compared to the unloaded material, reflecting the
presence of highly hydrophobic drug, although the value is much smaller
than for the CyA alone. The data therefore indicate that the incorporation
of the CyA into the micellar and nanofiber systems leads to a marked
decrease in contact angle, which may contribute to the observed enhancement
in dissolution.

CyA powder with contact angle 113°, (b) PVP powder with contact
angle 5°, (c) unloaded micellar freeze-dried powder with contact
angle 27°, (d) CyA loaded micelles with contact angle 39°
(freeze dried powder), (e) nanofiber without micelles and (f) CyA-loaded
micelle incorporated nanofibers with contact angle 23°, respectively.
The upper structure seen on the images is the needle used for drop-casting.

Overall, therefore, the very significant increases
in the dissolution
rate observed may be reasonably ascribed to a combination of surface
area, solubilization, molecular drug dispersion, and wetting effects,
demonstrating that the technology described here presents multiple
mechanisms of dissolution enhancement.

4 Conclusions
The study has indicated
that the highly hydrophobic peptide, CyA,
may be successfully formulated for enhanced dissolution using a combination
strategy of first incorporating into polymeric micelles followed by
further incorporation into nanofibers, using PVP as water miscible
polymeric matrix materials. More specifically, mixed micelles composed
of TPGS and Pluronic F127 were found to provide a suitable environment
for CyA incorporation both in terms of cmc and drug incorporation,
thereby presenting an initial, liquid-based system for delivery. However,
in order to subsequently prepare the drug system as a solid, with
advantages of surface area and solid dispersion formulation, the micellar
systems were spun into nanofibers using PVP as a base. It was noted
that fibers with suitable diameter and surface integrity were formed
with greatly improved dissolution compared to the drug alone. Further
advantages of the system include the use of materials with GRAS status and also a relatively high loading
of CyA, which in turn has positive implications for the dosage requirements.
The study has, therefore, indicated that by using this dual mechanism
it is possible to produce solid systems that clearly enhance the dissolution,
and potentially the bioavailability, of CyA. Furthermore, given the
increasing number of high molecular weight and low solubility drugs
that are currently in the pipeline, this technology provides a potential
platform for the development of fast-dissolution solid systems for
drugs, which provide particular challenges using conventional techniques.
