Two bis-tridentate Os(II) compounds
based on a heteroditopic terpyridine–bipyridine-type
ligand were synthesized, and their photophysical properties were thoroughly
studied. The compounds exhibit strong spin-allowed 1MLCT
bands in the visible domain (489–521 nm) as well as weak 1GS to 3MLCT bands within the 668–815 nm
domain. The compounds display strong luminescence from the 3MLCT state in the near-infrared domain (728–780 nm) at room
temperature having lifetimes in the range of 20.0–171.0 ns.
After coordination of [Os(tpy-PhCH3/H2pbbzim)2]2+ unit to the terpyridine site of tpy-Hbzim-dipy,
the complexes offer vacant pyridine–imidazole motifs for interacting
with cationic and anionic guests. Consequently, photophysical properties
of the compounds were tuned to a great extent upon interaction with
selected cations, anions, pH, as well as protons. Anion-induced alteration
of the ground- and excited-state properties of the compound lead to
recognition of specific anions in solution. Significant change in
the optical spectral behaviors as well as switching of emission spectral
properties of the compounds was done in the NIR region upon treating
with anions, cations, protons, and solvents (dichloromethane, acetonitrile,
methanol, dimethylsulfoxide, and water). Moreover, the optical outputs
in response to external stimuli were used to demonstrate binary functions
of two-input IMPLICATION, NOR, and XNOR logic gates.

Introduction
The last few decades
witnessed a great deal of activities on the
design of phosphorescent molecules that emit light in the visible
region at room temperature (RT) because of their potential applications
in a wide variety of areas, such as in photo-electrochemical cells,
organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), sensors, and bioimaging.1−7 Recent interest is focused on the development of phosphorescent
materials that emit in the near-infrared (NIR) region toward a variety
of applications in chemistry and biology.8−16 About 50% of the energy from the Sun reaches the Earth in the form
of NIR radiation. The use of NIR light is advantageous for recognition
and sensing as being invisible with less interference. In recent years,
NIR light is frequently used in fiberoptic communication, NIR OLEDs,
and night vision-readable displays.8−16

The design of materials whose properties can be altered upon
interaction
with different external stimuli, like light, pH, and chemical species,
is of particular interest in recent times with regard to enhancing
the utility and functionality of these materials.17,18 The applications of stimuli-responsive materials range from sensors19,20 to information processing as well as molecular switches and machines.21−25 Moreover, the materials based on transition metals are superior
compared with pure organic framework as the former have the ability
to better tune the structural, photophysical, and redox properties,
and thus, there remains a huge prospect for tuning of absorption and
emission wavelength, excited-state lifetime, and quantum efficiency
in the complexes by proper selection of ligand and metal.26−38

Our goal in this study is to design NIR emissive transition
metal
complexes whose physicochemical properties will be significantly altered
by a variety of external stimuli for the design of suitable functional
materials. In order to accomplish our goal, we have designed two Os(II)–terpyridine
complexes based on a bifunctional terpyridine–bipyridine ligand,
dipy-Hbzim-tpy, and thoroughly studied their stimuli-responsive photophysical
properties (Chart 1). Although a sizeable number of reports on polypyridyl Os(II) complexes
exhibiting NIR luminescence are available in the literature from our
laboratory39−49 as well as from other research groups,50−60 but to our knowledge, there is no report wherein the optical as
well as NIR luminescence properties of bis-terpyridine Os(II) complexes
were tuned and/or switched simultaneously upon interaction with anions,
cations, pH, protons, and solvents.

Chart 1 Molecular Structures of the Os(II)
Complexes
Photophysical properties
of Os(II)–polypyridine complexes
are more or less similar to their d6 Ru(II)
analogues, and both of them have been widely studied since the 1980s.61−63 Luminescence of Os(II) complexes usually occurs at longer wavelength
than that of similar Ru(II) analogues, in part because of the less-positive
oxidation potential of the OsII/OsIII couple.64 Lifetimes of Os(II) diimine complexes are usually
shorter than that of related Ru(II) complexes because of SOC effect
and energy gap law.64,65 The MC excited states of Os(II)
complexes are usually situated at higher energy than that of Ru(II)
analogues.64,65 This phenomenon is clearly observed
for bis-terpyridine complexes, viz. [Ru(tpy)2]2+, which is nonluminescent whereas [Os(tpy)2]2+ emits with reasonable efficiency at RT.66,67

In the design strategy, the terpyridine site of dipy-Hbzim-tpy
along with another tridentate co-ligand was coordinated to the Os(II)
center, leading to a bis-tridentate coordination mode, which is expected
to enhance the energy difference between emitting 3MLCT
and non-emitting 3MC excited states, leading to long-lived
excited states compared with tris-bipyridine-type coordination motif.
Moreover, upon coordination of the [Os(tpy-PhCH3/H2pbbzim)2]2+ unit to the terpyridine
site of tpy-Hbzim-dipy, the complexes offer vacant pyridine–imidazole
motifs, which were utilized for interacting with cationic and anionic
guests. Consequently, photophysical properties of the complexes were
tuned to a significant extent upon interaction with selected cations,
anions, as well as protons. Anion-induced changes in the photophysical
properties of the complexes give rise to recognition of selected anions
in organic as well as aqueous solutions. Thus, substantial modulation
of the optical spectral behaviors along with switching of luminescence
properties of the complexes was simultaneously made possible in the
NIR region upon interaction with external stimuli like anions, cations,
pH, protons, and solvents with varying polarities. In addition, spectral
outputs as a function of a particular set of ionic inputs were utilized
to demonstrate important logic functions, such as those of two-input
NOR, XNOR, and IMPLICATION logic gates exhibited by the complexes.
The idea of information processing at the molecular level was first
proposed by de Silva68 and, thereafter,
grew rapidly and finally gives rise to the emergence of a multidisciplinary
research area of molecular computing.69−74 Thus, tailored design of smart molecules that are able to demonstrate
complicated and sequential logic functions is still a significant
challenge in the contemporary research area of information technology.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
The
complexes were synthesized
by direct reaction between dipy-Hbzim-tpy and respective Os(II) precursors
([(tpy-PhCH3/H2pbbzim)OsCl3] in refluxing
ethylene glycol. Purification was done through column chromatography
and recrystallization techniques. Thorough characterization of the
compounds was performed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analysis, and the characterization
data are provided in the Experimental Section.

1H NMR spectra of the Os(II) complexes are presented
in Figure 1. Tentative
assignment of all the proton resonances was done with the aid of (1H–1H) COSY NMR spectra (Figure S1–S2, Supporting Information) and also by comparing
the spectra of structurally similar compounds.44−48 The sharp singlet at δ = 2.48 ppm (not shown
in Figure 1) corresponds
to the −CH3 unit of tpy-PhCH3 moiety
in 1. The doublet at δ = 6.03 ppm for 2 corresponds to H22 in H2pbbzim moiety as they are under
the influence of the anisotropic ring current effect of nearby pyridine
units. The singlet at δ = 13.05 ppm for both complexes is because
of imidazole NH in tpy-Hbzim-dipy, whereas the singlet at δ
= 15.05 ppm for 2 corresponds to NH in H2pbbzim.
The singlet at δ = 9.66 ppm is because of H3′ of dipy-Hbzim-tpy
in 2, whereas two singlets at δ = 9.58 and δ
= 9.49 ppm in 1 corresponds to H3′ in tpy-PhCH3 and dipy-Hbzim-tpy, respectively.

of 1–2 in DMSO-d6.
Atom numbering for different protons is shown
on the top of the spectra.

ESI mass spectra along with their experimental and simulated
isotopic
patterns are presented in Figure 2. Experimental and simulated isotopic patters correlate
well for both complexes. Each complex exhibits two peaks in the mass
spectrum. Complex 1 exhibits two peaks at m/z = 348.34 and m/z = 521.55, indicating the presence of [(dipy-Hbzim-tpy + H)Os(tpy-PhCH3)]3+ and [(dipy-Hbzim-tpy)Os(tpy-PhCH3)]2+ species, respectively. Complex 2 also
displays two peaks at m/z = 344.34
and m/z = 515.52 corresponding to
the existence of [(dipy-Hbzim-tpy + H)Os(H2pbbzim)]3+ and [(dipy-Hbzim-tpy)Os(H2pbbzim)]2+, respectively. Thus, both complexes were found to be protonated,
resulting in the presence of tri-positive cations.

distribution patterns.

Electronic Absorption and Emission Spectra
Spectral
profiles and related data of the complexes in selected solvents are
summarized in Table 1 as well as in Figures 3 and S3 (Supporting Information). Absorption
spectral signatures are similar, exhibiting very strong bands within
228–358 nm because of π–π* transition of
the ligands and moderately intense bands within 489–521 nm
assignable to Os(dπ) → tpy/H2pzbzim metal-to-ligand
charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. In addition, broad and weak bands
are also observed within 668–815 nm assignable to spin-forbidden1[OsII(dπ)6] → 3[OsII(dπ)5tpy/H2pzbzim (π*)1] MLCT transitions. Strong phosphorescence is observed for
each complex in the NIR domain of 728–780 nm at RT upon excitation
at their 1MLCT band. The phosphorescence originated from
the deactivation of 3MLCT (OsII(dπ) →
bpy/bpy-Hbzim-tpy (π*) excited state (Figures 3 and S3, Supporting Information). The compounds also exhibit strong emission at 77 K, with the band
maximum slightly blue-shifted compared with RT. E00 values (1.70 eV for 1 and 1.69 eV for 2) of the 3MLCT excited state were calculated from
their 77 K emission maxima. Excited-state decays were also acquired
in different solvents at RT as well as at 77 K in EtOH–MeOH
glass, and from the analysis of decays, the lifetimes were found within
20–171 ns at RT and 2.1–2.8 μs at 77 K (Figures
S4–S5, Supporting Information).
Small red-shift in the absorption (MLCT and ILCT) and emission maximum
is observed with solvents having high polarity and hydrogen bond-forming
capability.

Redox Behaviors of the
Complexes
Cyclic (CV) and square-wave
(SWV) voltammetric techniques were employed to investigate the redox
properties of the complexes in acetonitrile (Table S1, Supporting Information). The reversible peak
that is observed at E1/2 = 0.91 V for 1 and E1/2 = 0.80 V for 2 corresponds to the OsII/OsIII process.
Three reversible/quasi-reversible peaks that are observed in the negative
potential window (up to −2.0 V) can be assigned as the reductions
of the pyridine units in the complexes by comparing the electrochemical
data of the related compounds.

Acid–Base Properties
of the Complexes in Water
Complex 1 possesses
one whereas 2 contains
three imidazole NH protons in their secondary coordination sphere,
and these protons can be sufficiently acidic under the influence of
Os(II) center so that they can be removed upon increasing the pH of
the solution. Thus, we are interested to study the influence of pH
on the absorption and emission spectral behaviors of the complexes.
Robinson–Britton buffer was used to vary the pH of the solutions
within a broad pH range of 2.0–12.

Absorption and emission
spectral profiles of the complexes as a function of pH are presented
in Figures 4 and 5. Complex 1 shows two-step changes
in both absorption and emission spectra although there is only one
NH group residing on the dipy-Hbzim-tpy unit. The first change occurring
within the pH range of 4.0–6.0 is probably because of the removal
of a proton from the protonated pyridine–imidazole unit, which
most likely results during recrystallization of the complexes in the
presence of HClO4 medium, whereas the second change occurring
between pH 6.0 and 11.0 is because of the removal of NH from the neutral
imidazole ring, as shown in Scheme 1a. The presence of protonated tri-positive ion was
also evident in the ESI mass spectrum of both 1 and 2 (Figure 2).

Figure 4 Changes in the absorption (a and b) and photoluminescence (λex = 490 nm) spectra (c and d) of 1 with variation
in the pH of the solution. The insets show the change in absorbance
(a and b) and luminescence (c and d) with pH. Calculated pK1 and pK2 of 1 are 4.6 and 9.2, respectively.

Figure 5 Changes in the absorption (a–c) and photoluminescence (λex = 490 nm) spectra (d–f) of 2 with variation
in pH of the solution. The insets show the change in absorbance (a–c)
and luminescence (d–f) with pH. Calculated pK1, pK2, and pK3 of 2 are 4.1, 7.0, and 8.4, respectively.

Scheme 1 Proposed Acid-Base Equilibria in 1 (a) and 2 (b)
Complex 2 shows three successive deprotonation
steps
with the magnitude of change being larger than 1. The
first change occurring within the pH range of 3.0–5.0, is again
because of the removal of a proton from the protonated pyridine–imidazole
unit. The second- and third-stage change occurring within pH 5.0–11.0
is because of the successive removal of two NH protons from terminal
H2pbbzim unit. For both compounds, isosbestic points are
noticed in each step. It is of interest to note that the NH proton
residing on dipy-Hbzim-tpy is not deprotonated in 2 within
the pH range of 12. Three-stage acid–base equilibria occurring
in 2 can be presented in Scheme 1b. The pKa values
of the complexes were determined from their absorption versus pH profiles
using eq S1 (Supporting Information) and
summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 Ground- and Excited-State pKa Values of 1 and 2 in Water
compds	pK1	pK2	pK3	pK1*	pK2*	pK3*	
1	4.6	9.2	 	4.9	9.4	 	
2	4.1	7.0	8.4	4.2	7.1	9.1	
An
increase in pH from 4.0 to 6.0 leads to small emission enhancement,
whereas an increase beyond 6.0 leads to small emission quenching in 1. In the case of 2, an increase in pH gives
rise to emission quenching in the first step, with emission maximum
remaining unaltered, again quenching emission along with blue-shift
in the second step, whereas in the third step, augmentation of emission
takes place keeping the position of emission maximum unchanged. Thus, 1 behaves as an “off–on” emission switch
within the pH region of 4.0–6.0, whereas as an “on–off”
emission switch within the pH range of 6.0–11.0. By contrast, 2 behaves as an “off–off–on” emission
switch within the pH range of 3.0–11.0. The proper reason for
emission quenching and enhancement is quite complex and cannot be
explained in a straightforward manner. It is probable that the augmentation
of emission upon removal of the protonated pyridine–imidazole
unit leads to increase in the conjugation within the aromatic frame.
On the other hand, emission quenching upon removal of NH proton(s)
from the neutral imidazole moiety is probably because of photo-induced
intramolecular electron transfer (PET) from the deprotonated imidazole
moiety to the excited Os(II) center.

Lifetimes of both 1 and 2 were also acquired
as a function of pH. A small increase of lifetime of 1 is observed in the first stage, whereas a small decrease occurs
in the second step in accordance with its steady-state behavior (Figure
S6, Supporting Information). For 2, initial decrease, then increase and again substantial decrease
in lifetimes occur sequentially with the increase in pH, maintaining
the same trend with steady-state behavior (Figure 6). Excited-state pKa (pKa*) values of the compounds were determined from
lifetime versus pH data using eq S2 (Supporting Information).S2 The pK* values
are given in Table 2. The values of pKa* are greater than their corresponding pKa values. Relative values of pKa and pKa* give a qualitative idea regarding the localization
of charge in MLCT states of the compounds. Greater pKa* values suggest
that the MLCT state is primarily localized on the dipy-Hbzim-tpy moiety
in 1 and 2.

Figure 6 Three-step changes in the excited-state
lifetimes of 2 (a−c,
respectively) with variation in pH of the solution. Inset shows the
decay profiles of 2 as a function of pH. pKa* values are also
given in the figure. Excitation wavelength for acquiring lifetime
is 450 nm.

It is of interest to compare the
pH-sensing behaviors of closely
related complexes. In Table 3, we provided a comparison of pKa and pKa* values and luminescence switching behaviors
of some structurally related Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes mainly derived
from heteroditopic bpy-tpy and phen-tpy type of ligands.38,44,46,49,75−80

Anion Sensing Behaviors of the Complexes
Anion recognition
and sensing behaviors for both complexes were thoroughly studied in
acetonitrile and water. Present complexes, although very sensitive
toward few anions, such as F–, CN–, AcO–, and H2PO4–, are unselective toward differentiating a particular one in the
presence of others in acetonitrile. By contrast, selectivity greatly
enhanced on passing from acetonitrile to water. Hence, with regard
to their probable practical application, we will discuss the sensing
aspects of the complexes in water in the main text, whereas their
behaviors toward different anions in acetonitrile will be discussed
in the Supporting Information

The
selectivity increased to a significant extent in water with respect
to MeCN, and complex 1 recognizes CN– and SCN–, whereas 2 recognizes only
CN– in water, as reflected in their color changes
and absorption and emission spectral behaviors (Figure 7).

Figure 7 UV–vis absorption and emission spectral
changes of 1 [(a,b), respectively] and 2 [(c,d), respectively)]
in water on addition of different anions as their tetrabutylammonium
(TBA) salts. The visual color changes upon addition of different anions
are shown in the insets of figure (a,c).

Titration measurements were performed in HEPES buffer solution
at pH 7.2 to get rid of the interference of OH–,
which may be produced upon the hydrolysis of CN– (Figures 8, 9, and S19, Supporting Information). One-step change is observed in water for both compounds in contrast
to two-step changes in MeCN. Change in the MLCT and ILCT absorption
bands and quenching of emission are evident with CN– and SCN– for 1, with the extent of
change being larger with SCN– than with CN–. By contrast, the spectral changes occur with only CN– for 2. In addition, the magnitude of spectral changes
is found to be greater for 2 with CN–. Lifetime is almost unaltered for 1 in the presence
of both CN– (97.5 ns → 94.0 ns) and SCN– (97.5 ns → 95.0 ns), whereas the lifetime of 2 decreases to some extent with CN– (113.0
→ 97.0 ns) (Figures S20–S21, Supporting Information). The calculated values of the equilibrium/binding
constants (Ks) of the interaction between
complexes and anions vary between 2.02 × 104 M–1 and 4.58 × 104 M–1 (Table 4). In general, Ks in water is lower by almost two orders of
magnitudes compared to their values in MeCN. Calculated values of
detection limits of the compounds for CN– and SCN– were observed in the range 1.1 × 10–8 and 8.7 × 10–8 M (Table 5 and Figures S22–S27, Supporting Information), which are less compared
to the level for drinking water (0.2 ppm) recommended by the Environment
Protection Agency.81

Selectivity behaviors were checked by acquiring the
UV–vis
absorption and emission spectra of the compounds toward CN– and SCN– in the presence of each of the studied
competing anions. The optical spectral change as well as quenching
of emission occurs only after the addition of CN– (for 2 only) and both CN– and SCN– (for 1) to a solution containing a particular
complex and the mixture of other studied anions. Thus, extreme selectivity
and sensitivity along with chromogenic and fluorogenic behavior toward
CN– and SCN– over the other anions
make the complexes potential candidates for practical detection of
CN– and SCN– ions in water.

Mode of Interaction between Metalloreceptors and Anions
The observations made above from absorption and emission spectroscopic
investigations indicate that both complexes strongly interact with
selected anions, although to different extents, in acetonitrile as
well as in water. Although the compounds behave as sensors for CN–, F–, AcO–, and
H2PO4– in neat acetonitrile,
they are unselective for a particular anion in the presence of others.
On the contrary, 1 is selective for CN– and SCN–, whereas 2 is exclusive
for CN– in water. It would appear that the role
of the anions is to abstract the proton from the complexes according
to Scheme 1. In contrast
to two-step changes in acetonitrile, both compounds show one-step
change in water. pKa values in Table 2 indicate that the
NH proton associated with protonated-pyridine–imidazole in
both complexes as well as one of the two NH proton attached to H2pbbzim moiety in 2 get dissociated at physiological
pH (7.2). Thus, it is quite expected that both compounds show one-step
change in water compared to two-step changes in acetonitrile. The
inability of the complexes to sense F– ion in water
is because of its high hydration energy (ΔGh° = −465 kJ/mol for F–)
compared with CN– (ΔGh° = −295 kJ/mol). On the other hand, CN– acts as a stronger base (pKa = 9.0 for
HCN) in water compared with F– (pKa = 3.17 for HF) and AcO– (pKa = 4.75 for AcOH) ions.82

Modulation of Properties in Presence of Proton
Presence
of two pyridine units adjacent to the imidazole ring in both complexes
can lead to the protonation of at least some nitrogen atoms with acid.
We carried out absorption and emission titrations with HClO4 (Figures 10and S28, Supporting Information). In the absorption spectra,
finite change in the intensity of both MLCT and ILCT bands occurs
for 1 with negligible shift of the bands, whereas for 2, the diminution of the 1MLCT band at 489 nm occurs
with simultaneous emergence of a band at ∼525 nm. Augmentation
of emission intensity was observed for both complexes in the presence
of acid (Figures 10b and S28b, Supporting Information). The
lifetime of both complexes remains almost unaltered upon addition
of acid. Lone pairs of electrons on free pyridine sites of the complexes
get protonated in the presence of acid, and thus, photo-induced electron
transfer from free pyridine units to photo-excited [Os(tpy)2]2+/[(H2ppbzim)Os(tpy)]2+ unit gets
restricted to some extent, resulting in emission augmentation in the
complexes.

Figure 10 UV–vis absorption (a) and emission (λex = 490 nm) (b) spectral changes of 2 in MeCN
upon addition
of HClO4. The insets show the fit of the experimental absorbance
and luminescence data to a 1:2 binding profile.

Modulation of Properties with Cations
Pyridine–imidazole
units in both 1 and 2 offer bidentate chelating
sites, which could be utilized for interacting with cations. In this
context, we are interested in tuning the photophysical properties
in the presence of selected cations. Perchlorate salts of 3d metals
in their bivalent states (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+) were taken for this purpose. We checked
cation binding experiments in both acetonitrile and in water. However,
the complexes show only very weak response in water upon addition
of the said cations. Hence, cation-binding studies of the complexes
in acetonitrile are presented here. Absorption and emission spectra
upon addition of the said ions are presented in Figures S29 and S30
(Supporting Information). The MLCT band
remains almost invariant with Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+,
whereas it decreases substantially in the presence of Fe2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. The ILCT as well as π–π*
bands get intensified, albeit to different extents, with most of the
said cations. Titration experiments were performed to acquire quantitative
information regarding the interaction between the metalloreceptors
and cations (Figures 11, 12, and S31–S34, Supporting Information). Spectral changes occur in one-step
change with Fe2+ and Cu2+, whereas in two-step
changes with Zn2+ for both complexes. With Fe2+, decrease in both 1MLCT and 3MLCT bands with
concomitant increase in ILCT band at 407 nm occurs for both 1 and 2, but the magnitude of change is greater
for 2. Cu2+ also induces similar type of changes
for both complexes, although the magnitude of change is greater than
Fe2+, particularly for 1. In line with Fe2+ and Cu2+, the decrease in MLCT bands and increase
in ILCT bands take place with Zn2+ in two steps for 1, whereas for 2, a mall increase in both MLCT
and ILCT bands takes place in the first step, whereas in the second
step, decrease in both 1MLCT and 3MLCT bands
occurs with simultaneous evolution of the ILCT band with excess of
Zn2+. Clean isosbestic points are visible in each step
of the titration processes for both complexes. In the emission spectra,
almost complete emission quenching is observed for both complexes
in the presence of excess Fe2+ and Cu2+ (4 equiv).
By contrast, small emission augmentation occurs with Zn2+ in the first step, whereas substantial quenching takes place in
the second step for both complexes. Equilibrium constants (K) for complex–cation interaction processes were
evaluated though the use of absorption and emission titration data,
and the values are presented in Table 4.

10–5 M) in acetonitrile upon addition of Cu2+ (5 × 10–3 M). The insets show the
fit of
the experimental absorbance and luminescence data to a 1:2 binding
profile.

Figure 12 UV–vis absorption (a and b) and
luminescence (λex: 490 nm) (c and d) spectral changes
of 2 (1.0
× 10–5 M) in acetonitrile upon addition of
Zn2+ (5 × 10–3 M). The insets show
the fit of the experimental absorbance and luminescence data to a
1:2 binding profile.

It is observed that both Fe2+ and Cu2+ lead
to quenching of emission, whereas Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+ do not quench. With Zn2+, small emission enhancement occurs for both complexes upon
addition of up to 2 equiv Zn2+, although the presence of
excess Zn2+ causes emission quenching in both complexes.
The present Os(II) complexes can be considered as an assembly of fluorophore
and receptor, where the [Os(tpy)2]2+ group in 1 and [(H2ppbzim)Os (tpy)]2+ moiety
in 2 act as fluorophore, whereas pyridine–imidazole
conjugates can function as receptor for cations. Fe2+ and
Cu2+ with vacant 3d orbital can grab electron after photo-excitation
and can easily go to the lower oxidation state(s). Thus, emission
quenching is probably because of the photo-induced electron transfer
(PET) process.  

On the other hand, Zn2+, Cd2+, or Hg2+ ions are unable to accept extra electron because of their
completed shell, thus restricting the PET process and as a result,
the emission is not quenched. Although small emission enhancement
occurred with Zn2+ in the first step, to our surprise,
excess of Zn2+ also leads to substantial emission quenching
in the second step for both complexes. The actual reason for emission
quenching is not very clear to us. It would be possible that excess
of the cation may act as the proton abstractor from the imidazole
fragment, leading to the accumulation of negative charge, and emission
quenching is probably because of the PET process from deprotonated
imidazole unit to the photo-excited Os(II)-terpyridine unit.

Binary
Logic Operations Exhibited by the Complexes
Up to this point,
we have been quite successful to modulate the photophysical
properties of both complexes through anions, cations, as well as protons.
With regard to our intention to utilize these complexes, the optical
outputs (such as absorption and emission intensity at some specified
wavelength) upon the action of appropriate ionic inputs will be used
to explore whether the complexes can play the functions of some logic
gates.

NOR Logic Gate
Integrated functions of both NOT and
OR gates lead to the construction of a NOR gate. For the construction
of NOR gate, the emission band at 733 nm for 1 was monitored
as a function of two anionic inputs, H2PO4– (input 1) and F– (input 2). When
both inputs are absent, the emission intensity is maximum yielding
on-state (1), whereas the remaining three input combinations give
rise to quenching of emission under the threshold and thus leads to
the off-state (0) (truth table in Figure 13). Thus, 1 constructs a two-input
NOR gate.

of a NOR gate based on the emission at 733 nm, and (c) corresponding
truth table.

XNOR Logic Gate
For demonstrating the function of XNOR
gate in 2, again emission at 733 nm was used as a function
of F– and Zn2+. The presence or absence
of both inputs together leads to maximum emission intensity yielding
on-state (1) (Figure 14). By contrast, either input 1 or input 2 leads to quenching of emission
intensity under the threshold showing off-state (0). Thus, the truth
table in Figure 14 demonstrates XNOR logic function exhibited by complex 1.

on the emission at 733 nm, and (c) corresponding truth table.

IMPLICATION Gate
Whitehead and Russell pioneered the
logic operation of IMPLICATION gate along with three fundamental logic
operations, viz. AND, OR, and NOT. IMPLICATION gate is very important
with regard to “material implication”. For mimicking
the function of IMPLICATION gate, the emission band at 780 nm for 2 was monitored as a function of H+ (Input 1) and
F– (Input 2) (Figure 15). Figure 15 shows that in the presence of only F– (Input 1 = 0 and Input 2 = 1), emission intensity quenched substantially
(under the threshold; output = 0), showing off-state. Three other
input combinations imply on-state (truth table in Figure 15). Hence, by monitoring the
emission intensity of 2 at 780 nm as a function H+ and F–, an IMPLICATION gate could be constructed.

Conclusions
In the context of designing functional
materials with tuneable
properties, we report here the synthesis and characterization of two
NIR emissive Os(II)-terpyridine complexes based on a terpyridine–bipyridine-type
ligand and investigated their photophysical behaviors upon interaction
with different chemical stimuli. The complexes exhibit strong spin-allowed 1MLCT and weak spin-forbidden 1GS to 3MLCT absorption bands spanning throughout the entire visible region
and also show strong phosphorescence from the respective 3MLCT state in the near-infrared region (728–780 nm) at RT
with their lifetimes within 20.0–171.0 ns. The design principle
adopted here induces the terpyridine site of tpy-Hbzim-dipy ligand
to coordinate to the Os(II) center yielding two free pyridine–imidazole
units, which, in turn, can interact with anions, cations, pH, and
proton. In practice, photophysical behaviors of the compounds were
altered to a great extent in the presence of the aforementioned chemical
stimuli. Anion-induced deprotonation results in substantial changes
in photophysical behaviors of the compounds, which, in turn, gives
rise to recognition of selected anions in water. In reality, significant
alteration of the optical behaviors along with switching of emission
properties was achieved in the NIR region upon interaction with external
stimuli like anions, cations, pH, proton, and solvents. Moreover,
utilizing the optical responses in terms of stimuli, the functions
of two-input IMPLICATION, NOR, and XNOR logic gates were mimicked.
