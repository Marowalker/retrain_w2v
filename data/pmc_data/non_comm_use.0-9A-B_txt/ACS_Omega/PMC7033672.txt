The synthesis of new moisture-sensitive
imine-functionalized N-heterocyclic
carbene (NHC) precursor salts [1-(2-[(hydroxyl-benzylidene)-amino]-ethyl)-3-R-3H-imidazole-1-ium
bromide; R = methyl (1a), ethyl (1b), and
benzyl (1c)] is reported. Subsequent deprotonation of 1a–c and coordination of the in situ generated NHC
ligands to CoBr2 led to the isolation of air-stable six-coordinate
Co(III) complexes 2a–c, respectively. All the
salts and complexes were fully characterized. Single-crystal X-ray
analysis of 2a and 2c showed octahedral
Co centers hexacoordinated to two NHC carbons, two imine nitrogen
atoms, and two phenolate oxygens in the form [C^N^O(Co3+)C^N^O]. The complexes were used in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation
(CTH) of a range of ketones in 2-propanol as the solvent and hydrogen
donor. Based on a low catalyst concentration of 0.4 mol %, significant
conversions in the range of 70–99% were recorded at high turnover
frequencies up to 1635 h–1. A mechanism to account
for the steps involved in the CTH of cyclohexanone by complex 2a is proposed and supported by data from cyclic voltammetry,
low-resolution mass spectrometry, UV, and IR spectroscopic techniques.

1 Introduction
An imino N-heterocyclic
carbene (Im-NHC) is a multifunctional and
multidentate ligand framework derived with the aim of a synergistic
combination of properties of two moieties comprising a Schiff base
and NHC in one ligand framework.1 The idea
is to enrich the chemistry of the NHC family of ligands by providing
additional binding sites that may lead to the subsequent harnessing
of the combined attributes of both the Schiff base and the carbene.
The chemistry of Schiff bases has been well explored and documented
in the literature, and they are known for their ability to stabilize
metal centers in high and low oxidation states.2 Likewise, the successful isolation and characterization
of stable NHCs have led to the emergence of both transition metal-based
and transition metal-free NHC catalysts.3 The NHCs’ strong sigma donor ability has been utilized in
various transition metal complex-promoted organic transformations.4 Therefore, harnessing the potentials of Im-NHC
ligands is an advantage in fine-tuning the steric and electronic properties
of bound metal centers utilized in homogeneous catalysis. Over the
past decade, considerable attention has been devoted to this area
as a new frontier of intense research activity for organometallic
and coordination chemistry.5 Besides their
robust thermal stability, the other interesting feature of Im-NHC
metal complexes is the ease with which the ligand could be varied
leading to a theoretically endless possibility for both steric and
electronic tuning and hence stabilization of reactive species during
catalytic reactions.6 As compared to monodentate
NHC-metal complexes, Im-NHC metal complexes display a much broader
range of structural forms and wider scope of reactivity and can overcome
decomposition pathways leading to higher stability.5a,7,8 A recent investigation on Im-NHC Pd and
Ni complexes has revealed that the complexes were active for Suzuki
coupling reactions, hydroformylation of 1-octane, conjugate addition
reactions, and styrene polymerization.5a,7b,8a,9 Likewise, Im-NHC Ru
and Ni complexes are reported to be stable and excellent catalysts
for the reduction of aldehydes and ketones.10 Also, bimetallic and polynuclear transition metal complexes resulting
from Im-NHC ligation have been reported,7,11 and the hybrid
nature of the Im-NHC ligand framework has often led to improved actions
of the active metal species during catalysis.12 Hence, the successful utilization of these transition metal-based
catalysts has contributed immensely to human development and progress.3b,13

More specifically, the use of transition metal-based NHC complexes
as catalysts in transfer hydrogenation (TH) reactions was pioneered
by Nolan’s group.14 Currently, TH
has become the most widely applied and convenient route of transition
metal-based hydrogenation reactions.15 The
process is well established, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly
as compared to alternative methods of direct hydrogenation using high
pressure molecular H2 gas.16

Although significant progress has been made regarding catalytic
TH (CTH) of ketones, it is, however, worth mentioning that catalysis
based on heavy metals that include Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt, and Pd still dominate
the current literature.17 Although these
have proven to be high yielding catalysts, there is also a growing
interest in the catalytic capabilities of first-row transition metal
(Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) complexes. This is due to their low cost, relatively
lower toxicity, and the fact that they are abundant and readily available.18 In addition, recent studies on the application
of earth-abundant metals as alternatives to heavy metal-based catalysts
in various organic reactions that include the TH of ketones have been
reported.15a,18c,19 Magubane et al. reported the synthesis of Ni(II) and Fe(II) complexes
and their application as catalysts in TH of ketones.20 In another related study, the use of nickel, iron, and
cobalt complexes containing chiral aminophosphine ligands as catalysts
in TH of ketones was reported and the catalytic systems showed excellent
substrate conversions.21 For almost a decade,
we have been working on these low-cost, earth-abundant metals. We
have previously reported the utilization of iron and nickel complexes
as catalysts in the TH of both aromatic and aliphatic ketones with
good to excellent conversions.10b,18b In this report, we
are expanding the scope to cobalt complexes, and this is because,
to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on NHC–Co
complexes of this type and their application as catalysts for TH reactions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
The
cobalt complexes 2a–c were prepared (Scheme 1) by the direct reaction
of in situ generated free carbenes and CoBr2, a procedure
similar to the one reported by Gorczyński et al.22 The ligand precursors 1a and 1b were first reported by Zhu et al.,1 while 1c was reported in our previous article.11 The complexes (2a–c) were
prepared by stirring 1 mmol equiv of the respective ligand precursors
(1a–c) with KOtBu
(3 equiv) in methanol for 15 min and then CoBr2 (0.5 mmol)
was slowly added to the in situ generated free carbene, and the resulting
mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for another 4 h. All
the afforded complexes were isolated in excellent yields (71–96%).
Complexes 2a and 2b appeared as reddish-brown
powders, while 2c was isolated as a maroon powder. All
the complexes 2a–c were stable in air and soluble
in methanol, acetone, dichloromethane, chloroform, and acetonitrile.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route to the Title Complexes 2a–c
2.2 Spectroscopic Analysis
A clear sign
of ligand coordination is observed in the 1H NMR spectrum
of compound 2a, which upon integration showed a total
of 14 protons as opposed to the 16 protons in 1a. This
corresponds to the loss of the phenolic proton (observed at 12.5 ppm
in 1a) and the carbene (C2) proton (observed at 10.2
ppm in 1a). Meanwhile, there is a general upfield shift
for all other protons in the compound. For instance, the imine proton
which was observed around 8.4 ppm in the ligand precursor shifted
to 7.7 ppm in the complex, and the results agree with values reported
for a similar compound.10a Complexes 2b and 2c did not yield resolved NMR data, perhaps
because of paramagnetism exhibited by the cobalt(III) octahedral complexes.23 Other characterization data, from the high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) of the complexes, are consistent with the
calculated values for the relative abundance of cobalt. The results
confirm that the complexes were obtained as constituted in Scheme 1. The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the complexes 2a–c show
the disappearance of the phenolic (OH) absorption band around 3400
cm–1, a sign of the coupling of the phenoxy v(OH) bond and the formation of an oxygen-to-metal bond.
However, the presence of residual water molecules as indicated by
the CHN and single-crystal analysis was responsible for the broad
signals observed around 3400 cm–1 in the IR spectra
of 2b and 2c. Further evidence of complexation
is the slight shift of the v(C=N) stretching frequencies from
the region around 1628 cm–1 in the ligand precursors
to 1615 cm–1 observed in the spectra of the metal
complexes. These trends are all in agreement with reported values
for similar compounds in the literature.24 Characteristic vibrational frequencies of v(O–Co and N–Co)
were located around the region of 426 and 486 cm–1, respectively.25 CHN elemental analysis
data are all within the acceptable range (±0.3) between the calculated
and measured values.

2.3 Single-Crystal Structural Analysis by X-ray
diffraction
The slow evaporation of methanolic solutions
of the complexes yielded crystals suitable for analysis by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction for both 2a and 2c. Details
on methods for crystallographic data acquisition, reduction, and refinement
are available (see Table SI 1 in the Supporting Information). ORTEP diagrams depicting the molecular structures
of compounds 2a and 2c are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Both structures show hexacoordinated centro-symmetric
coordination of the tridentate ligands around each Co(III) center.
Compound 2a is composed of a central cobalt ion bound
to two moieties of the ligand 1-{2-[(2-hydroxy-benzylidene)-amino]-ethyl}-3-methyl-3H-imidazole-1-ium bromide, while 2c is similarly
composed with the ligand being 1-{2-[(2-hydroxy-benzylidene)-amino]-ethyl}-3-benzyl-3H-imidazole-1-ium bromide. Each six-coordinate octahedral
geometry is made up of two phenolate oxygen donors, two imine nitrogen
donors, and two carbene donors for both 2a and 2c.18c,26 In 2a, the bond
angles between the axial atoms C(4)–Co(1)–N(3) and the
equatorial ones C(4)–Co(1)–O(1) range between 83.75(12)
and 96.25(12). Similarly, in 2c, the bond angles between
C(12)–Co(1)–N(1) and C(12)–Co(1)–O(1)
range between 84.58(13) and 95.42(13). The respective bond distances
for C(4)–Co(1), N(3)–Co(1), and O(1)–Co(1) in 2a are 1.966(3), 1.931(3), and 1.904(2); likewise, in 2c, the bond distances for Co(1)–C(12), Co(1)–N(1),
and Co(1)–O(1) are 1.963(3), 1.934(3), and 1.902(2), respectively.
Results for the bond angles and bond distances recorded for both 2a and 2c are comparable to reported values for
similar cobalt complexes.18c,27

2.4 CV Data Analysis
A cathodic scan
in the negative direction records the respective reversible reduction
wave peak at circa −1.107, −1.206, and −1.156
V (Figures SI 15, 16, & 17) for 2a, 2b, and 2c which are due to
the process (Co3+) + e– → (Co2+). The ease of reduction of the analytes from Co(III) to
Co(II) is due to the hemilabile weakly coordinated imine N(s) that
allows for accommodation of the added electron density in the antibonding
dz2 orbital of the metal.28 Upon reversal of the scan direction, all the
complexes were re-oxidized from Co(II) to Co(III) at potentials of
−1.178 V (2a), −1.375 V (2b), and −1.224 V (2c), thus regenerating the six-coordinate
(Co3+) complexes. At 100 mV/s, the ΔEp values for the complexes are 0.071 V 2a, 0.169 2b, and 0.068 V 2c (Table 1).

a Oxidation (anodic) and reduction
(cathodic) peak potentials (Epa and Epc, respectively).

Although the results are slightly higher than the
standard values
of 0.058 V for one-electron reversible systems, they are still within
the accepted values for a reversible process.29 Nicholson and Shain reported that in reversible systems, the position
of the reverse peak may shift as much as 5 mV.30 However, in an apparent indication of a simple one-electron
process, a second weak reduction process of (Co2+) + e– → (Co1+) was observed with 2a at a much lower potential of circa −0.4 V and oxidation
potential of circa −0.7 V.28 This
second wave indicated a quasi-reversible behavior with a ΔEp value around 0.2 V.29

Results for both the cathodic reductions and the anodic oxidations
are summarized in Table 1.

3 CTH of Ketones
The production of industrially
relevant feedstock from simple organic
substrates continues to attract the attention of researchers interested
in the homogenous hydrogenation of polar functional groups.31 The process may occur via the use of molecular
hydrogen (H2) or the more convenient and safer alternative
of using hydrogen transfer methods. Instead of pressurized gas, TH
relies on the use of solvents as hydrogen donors of which the most
frequently used include isopropanol, ammonia boranes, and formic acid.16,32 Majority of the Co-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions reported to
date are based on complexes stabilized by tri- and tetradentate donor
ligand frameworks.31,33 Some of the leading Co-based
catalytic systems include the work by Milstein and co-workers,34 who reported on the hydrogenation of esters
catalyzed by Co lutidine-based pincers with a catalyst loading of
2–4 mol %, at 130 °C and 50 bar H2 gas pressure.
The same catalyst was also used to promote nitrile hydrogenation to
primary amines.35 The selectivity of Co-catalyzed
hydrogenation of ketones and aldehydes was reported by Kempe and co-workers,36 while Jones et al. reported on the use of molecular
H2 in the hydrogenation of esters.37 Similarly, Zhang and Hanson reported the application of cobalt amino
pincer catalysts in the reduction of ketones, aldehydes, and imines.
However, their catalysts showed poor selectivity for the reduction
of carbonyls that are in conjugation with olefins.38 Finally, Shao et al. also utilized ammonia boranes as hydrogen
sources in the development of Co catalysts for the TH of nitriles.39

In this study, the Im-NHC cobalt complexes 2a–c were used as catalysts for the TH of a variety
of ketones using
KOH as an auxiliary base in 2-propanol as the solvent and hydrogen
donor (Table 2). The
selective reduction of acetophenone to the corresponding 1-phenylethanol
(Scheme 2) was selected
at the onset as a model reaction to optimize the reaction conditions.
The effects of the catalyst and the base were first tested with a
reaction conducted over a period of 8 h without the use of an auxiliary
base, which resulted in no conversion to the desired product. However,
the reaction with only KOH (20 mol % in 2 mL of 2-propanol, no added
catalyst) resulted in 26% conversion to 1-phenylethanol. This observation
is in line with literature values for a reaction conducted under similar
conditions.10a However, to determine the
most effective catalyst concentration, reactions were conducted with
a gradient of catalyst concentration for compounds 2a–c ranging from 0.1 to 1 mol % (Figure 3). The overall results show that there is a linear
relationship between the catalyst concentration and substrate conversion
up to 0.4 mol %. A further increase in catalyst concentration to 1
mol % resulted in a general decline in activity; hence, all further
studies were conducted at 0.4 mol % concentration of the catalyst.
Spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixture over the course of
6 h did confirm the stability of the metal complex during the course
of the CTH (see below). Hence, catalyst decomposition is ruled out
as a reason for the decline in activity at higher concentrations.
However, several reports in the literature where a similar trend was
observed have opined that it is due to the usual agglomeration of
the complex in solution, consequently lowering the number of available
active species.20,40 In the absence of any data to
the contrary, this is a plausible explanation for the trend observed
in Figure 3. It is
also clear from Figure 3 that the catalytic system based on complex 2a is more
efficient than either 2b or 2c. For example,
the 4 h reaction with 0.1 mol % concentration of 2a yielded
42% conversion whence 2b and 2c yielded
30 and 36% conversions, respectively.15d,41 The behavior
of the catalysts showed that steric hindrance due to the varying wingtip
N-substituents is slightly significant in regulating substrate access
to the CoII/III centers during the course of the CTH (see
the proposed mechanism). Hence, complex 2a bearing the
least sterically hindering methyl N-substituent exhibited slightly
higher activity than either 2b (ethyl) or 2c (benzyl). In general, the catalytic activities are within a statistically
insignificant range which is similar to observations reported for
Ni–NHC complexes used for CN coupling reactions.42 On this basis, we conducted further optimization
studies and substrate scope analysis with only complex 2a as the catalyst. The results (Figure 4) show that 98 and 95% conversions of cyclohexanone
and benzophenone were achieved in 4 and 2 h, respectively, indicating
a much better efficiency of the catalyst for these substrates as compared
to the 77% recorded with acetophenone in 4 h. The reaction time profile
shows that 4 h is the optimum time for substrate conversion. It is
important to note that only the substrate acetophenone exhibited a
decrease in conversion beyond the 4 h reaction time (Figure 4). This may be due to further
reaction of the product 1-phenylethanol under the catalytic conditions
to yield higher cross-coupling products.41b Hence, under the optimized conditions, a variety of ketones were
utilized as substrates, and the result is summarized in Table 2.

With reference to acetophenone (entry 1) as the model
substrate,
entries 2–11 show the influence of structural and electronic
variations on the reactivity of the C=O bond of the various
ketones (entries 2–12). A wide variation in catalyst efficiency
(turnover frequency, TOF) was observed up to a maximum of 1635 h–1 for 1-phenyl-2-butanone (entry 8).

The general
trend is that acetophenone derivatives bearing mild
deactivating halogen groups para to the C=O interacted better
with the catalyst resulting in better efficiencies (entries 2–4),
while the opposite effect was observed for electron-donating groups
para to C=O (entries 5 and 6). These results agree with the
work of Sortais and co-workers on the reduction of aryl-alkyl ketones,
catalyzed by manganese complexes bearing chiral diamine ligands.43 The results are also comparable with data from
a similar work based on ruthenium complexes with 10 mol % of a base
refluxed in 2-propanol for 45–180 min from which conversions
between 90 and 97% were reported.44 However,
the least conversion of 17% recorded for 2-methyl-3-hexanone over
20 h (entry 12) is clearly due to steric hindrance by the neighboring
flexible sp3 carbons that limit accessibility and coordination
to the C=O bond. In general, this is the observation and explanation
for the poor conversions of linear ketones in CTH.18b

3.1 Mechanistic Study of the CTH of Ketones by
Complex 2a
A proposed mechanism for the CTH
of ketones reported in this study is presented in Scheme 3. Based on the experimental
data, it is proposed that the reduction of the ketones to alcohols
proceeded via one-electron transfer processes. There are numerous
proposals in the literature, but the route that involves the formation
of a metal alkoxide 6 is the most reported and accepted
pathway.45

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism
for the CTH of Cyclohexanone with Complex 2a as the Catalyst
Hence, the mechanism is proposed to begin with
the conversion of
the precatalyst 2a to isopropanol-coordinated 3 which was possible because of the hemilabile imine N-donor. Transformation
of 3 into a metal hydride allows for the insertion of
the carbonyl to form 4 which releases isopropanone to
yield compound 5. The metal alkoxide 6 is
then formed from 5 and after ligand exchange with the
solvent 2-propanol, the product is released. To complete the cycle,
the solvent (which also serves as the hydrogen donor) isopropanol
is coordinated to regenerate 3. It is worth noting that 3–6 were monitored and observed by liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) (See the Supporting Information for details).

To shed more light on the structural
changes that the catalyst
undergoes during the CTH that led to the proposed mechanism (Scheme 3), the catalytic
process was monitored using UV–vis and IR spectroscopic techniques.
The UV–vis spectrum of complex 2a dissolved in
2-propanol (Figure 5 standard) displays two strong absorption maxima at 250 and 450 nm
which are assigned to the Co–O and Co–N metal-to-ligand
charge transfer bands, respectively.28 A
similar pattern was also observed with related imino Ni(II) and imino
Cu(II) complexes.46 At the beginning of
the reaction, with the substrate and oxidant added, no changes in
the pattern of the absorption spectrum were observed (Figure 5, 0 h). However, decreased
intensity of the low energy band at 450 nm which was accompanied by
the appearance of a broad band at 320 nm (Figure 5, 1 h) is attributed to an overlap of the
n−π* transition because of the C=O (substrate)
and C=N (ligand) absorption bands.47 We propose this to be an indication of hemilability of the imino
(Co–NC) donor during the catalytic cycle and clear sign that
the phenoxy (Co–O) donor remained unchanged (absorption maxima
at 250 nm) throughout the course of the reaction.48

Figure 5 UV–vis results showing the stability of 2a during
a 6 h reaction time at 82 °C.

Furthermore, the reaction was closely monitored
using infrared
spectroscopy. A setup similar to that described for the UV–vis
study was utilized, and the results are presented in Figure 6. In support of the UV-results,
the IR spectra also revealed that both Co–N and Co–O
absorption bands remained unchanged in the region 486 and 426 cm–1, respectively.25,49 This observation confirms
the structural stability of complex 2a during the course
of the reaction. Therefore, the combination of the cyclic voltammetry
(CV), UV–vis, FTIR, and low-resolution MS (LRMS) results suggest
a one-electron-based mechanism as the pathway for the CTH processes.

4 Conclusions
In summary, three new Co–NHC
complexes, 2a, 2b, and 2c,
were synthesized and used as efficient
catalysts for the TH of a variety of ketones. The complexes were fully
characterized using both analytical and spectroscopic techniques.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of compounds 2a and 2c determined the geometry of the complexes,
with each complex having a hexacoordinated Co(III) at the center of
an octahedral array of ligands. The results for the catalytic studies
confirm that the Co–NHC complexes have good potential for use
as catalysts in the TH of ketones. The results showed that the complex
bearing a small N–Me wingtip substituent is relatively more
active compared to those with bulkier N-substituents. On-stream spectroscopic
analyses confirmed catalyst stability during the course of the CTH
reaction; hence, the observed drop in catalytic activity at higher
complex concentrations is due to agglomeration of active species in
solution.

5.5 Procedure for the Catalytic Studies
Samples for catalytic studies were prepared as follows: a substrate
(ketone) was placed into a clean Schleck tube fitted with a reflux
condenser and a stir bar, followed by the addition of the cobalt complex
(2a–c, 0.4 mol %) and KOH (20 mol % in 2 mL of
2-propanol). The mixture was then refluxed at 82 °C for 4 h.
Conversions were monitored using GC-FID. An aliquot was taken at a
predetermined time and passed through a pad of cotton wool and then
injected (1 μL) into the GC equipped with a DB5 wax polyethylene
column (30 m × 0.25 mm). A comparison of the observed retention
times with those of standards purchased from Sigma-Aldrich identified
the products. Percentage conversions were calculated from the respective
peak areas.

5.6 Procedure for CV
Cyclic voltammograms
were measured in acetonitrile, using a Metrohm 797 potentiostat and
three-electrode system, consisting of glassy carbon as a working electrode,
a platinum wire as the reference electrode, and a Ag/AgCl system as
a counter electrode. A 0.1 M solution of NBu4PF6 was used as a supporting electrolyte. A blank solution of acetonitrile
and the solution of the electrolyte were run for a background check.
All solutions were purged and maintained under an inert atmosphere
of N2 gas during the experiment. A scan rate of 100, 250,
and 500 mV/s was measured in a potential window of 0.3 to −1.7
V.50

5.7 Procedure for Structural Determination by
Single-Crystal XRD Data Analysis
Quality single crystals
of compounds 2a and 2c suitable for XRD
analysis were selected and attached to a Mitegen loop and centered
in the X-ray beam by the aid of a video camera. Intensity data were
collected on a Bruker APEXII diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å) equipped with an Oxford Cryostream low-temperature
apparatus operating at 100(1) K. The initial cell matrix was determined
from three series of scans consisting of twelve frames collected at
intervals of 0.5° in a 6° range with the exposure time of
10 s per frame. Each of the three series of scans was collected at
different starting angles, and the APEX251 program suite was used to index the reflections and refined using
SAINT.52 Data reduction was performed using
SAINT software, and the scaling and absorption corrections were applied
using the SADABS53 multiscan technique.
The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS.54 Non-hydrogen atoms were first refined isotropically
and then by anisotropic refinement with full-matrix least-squares
based on F2 using SHELXL.54 All
hydrogens were positioned geometrically, allowed to ride on their
parent atoms and refined isotropically.
