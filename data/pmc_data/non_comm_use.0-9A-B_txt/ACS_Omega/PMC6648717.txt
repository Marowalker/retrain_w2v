Evolution
of the polymorph selectivity of titanium dioxide was
studied under acidic and low-temperature synthesis conditions. Short
synthesis times resulted in high relative amounts of the rutile phase,
and long synthesis times resulted in high relative amounts of the
brookite and anatase phases. The effect of titania precursor concentration
was investigated and found to have a large impact on the polymorph
selectivity. As the reaction proceeds with time, changes in the chemical
environment, caused in particular by the gradually decreasing titania
precursor concentration, are therefore likely the cause of the change
in polymorph selectivity observed.

Introduction
Nanostructured titanium
dioxide or titania (TiO2) has
received much attention from industry as well as the research community
during the past decades as a functional material for numerous applications
including sustainable energy production,1,2 self-cleaning
surfaces,3 osseointegration support,4 and catalysis.5 This
continuous interest in nanostructured titania and titania-containing
nanocomposites has spurred the development of methods to synthesize
them under versatile conditions, for example, at low temperature,
under different pH, and from different precursors. As a consequence,
nowadays, a broad range of synthesis routes to nanostructured titania
is available including sol–gel routes,6,7 hydrothermal
routes,8−10 and micelle and inverse micelle routes.11,12 On the basis of the microemulsion system, a low-temperature synthesis
of crystalline mesoporous titania with good polymorph control has
been previously developed.13,14 In these studies, it
was shown that pH, temperature, and synthesis time influenced the
polymorph distribution.13−15

Controlling the crystallinity
and the polymorph distribution of
nanostructured titania is of paramount importance for application-targeted
material design. Anatase, rutile, and brookite are the three main
crystal polymorphs of titania of which rutile is the thermodynamically
most stable polymorph in bulk titania.16−18 However, low-temperature
wet chemical synthesis routes frequently produce titania in the thermodynamically
less favored anatase phase. In general, the synthesis of thermodynamically
less stable phases is achieved by kinetically controlled synthesis
routes. It has, however, been predicted that anatase and brookite
can be thermodynamically favored over rutile when crystallite sizes
are of a few nanometers in size.19 Banfield
et al. suggested that the formation of nanosized titania crystallites
in the anatase and brookite phases could be explained by a reversal
of the thermodynamic stability for titania crystallites smaller than
35 nm.20 They predicted that brookite was
the thermodynamically most stable phase between 11 and 35 nm and anatase
below 11 nm.16,20 Their predictions were at a sufficiently
small crystallite size, the high-surface free energy of rutile compared
to anatase becomes dominant over the difference in bulk free energy
and thus reverses the relative thermodynamic stability of anatase
and rutile. The surface free energy of brookite was estimated to be
in a similar range as the other two phases. It should be noted that
these predictions do not take into account the effect of the chemical
environment of the nanoparticles, which may have a significant contribution
to the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the phases. To our knowledge,
the reversed thermodynamic stability of the titania phases has not
hitherto been experimentally verified.

Here, we report a systematic
study of a low-temperature low-pH
synthesis of titania and experimentally demonstrate an apparently
thermodynamically driven formation of brookite and anatase nanocrystals.
This opens up a new avenue of synthesis procedures for polymorph-selective
synthesis of nanocrystalline titania materials. We investigate the
influence of variables, such as the synthesis time and titania precursor
concentration, and assess the effects of time-evolving changes in
chemical composition of the synthesis mixture resulting from the progression
of the reaction.

Results and Discussion
Three series
of titania samples were prepared according to the
procedures described in the Experimental Methods section and summarized in Table 1.

Diffractograms of samples
A1 to A9 are shown in Figure 1a. The Bragg peaks that were
mainly used to identify the distinct phases of titania are observed
at 2θ = 27.4° (rutile (110)), and a set of peaks that originate
from three reflections, one from anatase (101) and two brookite reflections
(120) and (111) are observed at approximately 2θ = 25.3°.
Additionally, the Bragg peak at 2θ = 30.8° corresponding
to the brookite (121) reflection is observed for samples A5–A9.
The diffractograms clearly display a shift from mainly rutile phase
for sample A1 toward a progressively higher content of titania in
the anatase and brookite phases for samples A4–A9. Interestingly
and contrary to the normally observed increase in selectivity for
rutile formation at prolonged reaction times,14,24 we here observe a progressive increase of anatase and brookite accompanied
by a relative decrease of the rutile phase. However, this apparently
agrees with the predictions by Banfield et al. of the existence of
a thermodynamic driving force for the formation of anatase and brookite
for crystallites below 11 nm and between 11 and 35 nm, respectively.20 Because of the peak overlap of the anatase and
brookite phases, the phase identification by simple peak indexing
can be difficult, making modeling of the PXRD essential. However,
the peak at 30.8° confirms that brookite is present in samples
A5–A9. To properly identify crystalline phases and to quantify
the phase composition in each sample, the Rietveld refinements were
performed. Figure 1b shows the refinement of sample A5, where the observed (obs) and
calculated (cal) patterns are presented as well as the difference
between the two (obs–cal). The Bragg peaks of each phase are
shown below the diffractograms. The morphology of the crystals was
also obtained and is presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The refined parameters, including
crystal sizes, spherical harmonic coefficients, and the unit cell
parameters, are reported in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffractograms of samples A1–A9. The diffractograms
are in the order of increasing reaction time, from bottom to top,
and offset in intensity for clarity. (b) Rietveld refinement of sample
A5. The observed pattern is shown in black, calculated pattern in
red, and the difference between observed and calculated is shown below
in blue. The Bragg peak positions for each phase are indicated below.

Figure 2 shows quantitatively
how the weight fraction of each crystal phase develops with synthesis
time for series A from 3 to 56 days. It is worth pointing out that
after 39 days, the reaction yield is measured to be 95%, but due to
possible material loss in the washing process, which is not accounted,
the conversion of the titania precursor is likely closer to 100%.
Because almost all the precursor has been transformed to titania particles
at that point, changes in phase composition are unlikely hereafter
in this low-temperature synthesis.

Figure 2 Relative weight fraction of rutile (blue
squares), brookite (green
down-pointing triangles), and anatase (red up-pointing triangles)
in series A. The weight fractions were extracted from the Rietveld
refinements of the diffractogram of each sample.

The fractions of the phases are obtained from the Rietveld
refinements
of the X-ray diffractograms of each sample. In Figure 2, it can be observed that the relative weight
fraction of rutile decreases quite rapidly from 88 to 26% between
3 and 24 days of synthesis time, after which the decrease is slower
and finally the relative fraction stabilizes at 13% after 39 days.
Conversely, the relative weight fraction of brookite and anatase is
initially low but increases with increasing synthesis time. The fraction
of brookite increases from 3 to 62% between 3 and 39 days of synthesis
time, and the fraction of anatase stabilizes at 25% after 39 days.
This time-dependent polymorph selectivity indicates that rutile is
initially formed by a kinetically driven mechanism, which is dominant
in the earlier stage of the reaction, whereas anatase and brookite
phases are formed at later stages in what may appear to be thermodynamically
favored mechanisms. Although it can be observed from Figure 2 that the phase composition
changes with synthesis time, it is not clear if the rutile phase is
transformed to anatase and brookite, or if they are formed separately
from the unreacted precursor. It should also be noted that the fractions
shown here are relative weight fractions of the three crystalline
phases and do not contain information about the amorphous phase.

To determine the absolute amount formed of each crystal phase at
any given time of the synthesis, the conversion yield of the reaction
has to be taken into account. In addition to that, to account for
the amorphous phase, additional XRD measurements with a quantitative
internal standard were conducted. The nature of the amorphous phase
has not been studied in detail in the present work, but other studies
have reported that apparently amorphous structures may have an atomically
ordered core and a large number of defects closer to the surface of
the particle. In these studies, in situ total X-ray scattering measurements10,25 and wide-angle X-ray scattering with PDF analysis26 were used to describe the amorphous phase. The latter study
included the formation of amorphous titania nanoparticles, which were
described as having a strained anatase-like core with a highly distorted
shell. The average coordination number of titanium was estimated lower
and the Ti–O bond length shorter than in bulk titania, which
was attributed to features in the distorted shell.

Figure 3 shows the
yield of each phase where on the y-axis, the weight
fraction is multiplied with the total yield of the reaction. The total
yield was measured by dividing the mass of the retrieved titania particles,
after centrifuging, washing, and drying, with the theoretical mass
as if 100% conversion of the titania precursor was achieved. The inset
shows the total yield of the reaction, which approaches 100% after
39 days. It can be seen that of the three crystal structures, mainly
rutile is initially formed, and after 11 days, the absolute amount
of rutile remains nearly constant. From 14 days, the anatase and brookite
polymorphs are mainly formed. This indicates that the rutile crystals
are not transformed to the other crystal structures, but rather that
the crystallization of anatase and brookite occurs separately at the
later stages of the reaction. The amorphous phase is formed continuously
throughout the whole synthesis time and is the predominant phase from
11 days onward.

Figure 3 Time evolution of the phase formation in series A. The
yield of
the phases is calculated by multiplying the relative concentration
of each phase with the total yield of the reaction. The total crystallinity
(purple diamonds) is the sum of the rutile (blue squares), anatase
(red up-pointing triangles), and brookite (green down-pointing triangles)
phases. The yield of the amorphous phase (black stars) increases during
the whole synthesis time. The inset shows the total yield of the reaction.

To rationalize the drastic change
in polymorph selectivity observed
in Figures 1 and 2, we need to understand what factors may influence
this. From previous studies, it is known that several factors, such
as the type of titania precursor and its concentration, pH, type of
acid, and temperature, impact the crystal structure formation for
TiO2.8,14,15,27 In our system, the concentration of unreacted
titania precursor decreases as the reaction proceeds and titania particles
form and there is also a change in pH as the precursor is first hydrolyzed,
and then as a result of condensation reactions between molecular titania
precursors and the surface of the growing particles. More specifically,
we note that the initial precursor concentration in series A is 0.65
M and at this stage, mainly rutile forms. Because of particle formation,
the concentration of molecular titania precursor species decreases
to 0.45 M after 14 days, and from this point forward, mainly brookite
and anatase crystals form. To investigate our hypothesis that the
concentration of molecular titania precursor species influences the
polymorph selectivity, two additional series of samples were prepared.
In series B and C, the initial precursor concentration was lower and
higher, respectively, compared to series A. The effect of the initial
titania precursor concentration on the polymorph selectivity is illustrated
in Figures 4 and 5.

were extracted from the Rietveld refinements of the diffractogram
of each sample. (b) The total crystallinity (purple diamonds) is the
sum of the rutile (blue squares), anatase (red up-pointing triangles),
and brookite (green down-pointing triangles) phases. The yield of
the amorphous phase (black stars) increases during the whole synthesis
time. The inset shows the total yield of the reaction.

weight fractions were extracted from the Rietveld refinements of the

diamonds) is the sum of the rutile (blue squares), anatase (red up-pointing
triangles), and brookite (green down-pointing triangles) phases. The
yield of the amorphous phase (black stars) is lower than the total
crystallinity at 56 days. The inset shows the total yield of the reaction.

Figure 4a shows
how the relative weight fraction of each crystal phase changes with
synthesis time in series B, where the initial titania precursor concentration
is 0.33 M. A synthesis time of 7–14 days results in 50–55%
rutile relative weight fraction, whereas for synthesis time of 32–56
days, it decreases to about 5%. The brookite fraction is 40% for a
synthesis time of 7–14 days after which it increases to 70%
for 32–56 days. Similarly, the anatase fraction increases from
5% to about 22% from synthesis time of 7 to 56 days. This is a similar
trend as seen in series A, where the fraction of rutile decreases
with increasing synthesis time, and at the same time, the fraction
of anatase and brookite increases. However, in series B, the fraction
of rutile is at all points much lower than in series A.

Figure 4b shows
the yield of each phase in series B. The inset shows the total yield
of the reaction, which is only about 10% after 14 days but reaches
85% after 56 days. It means that although the relative weight fraction
of rutile during the first 14 days is quite high, the absolute amount
of rutile formed is very low, where the yield of the phase is less
than 3% after 56 days. After 14 days, mainly brookite and anatase
crystal phases are formed along with the amorphous phase. With the
initial lower titania precursor concentration [Ti] = 0.33 M, series
B yields much less rutile than series A. Interestingly, the yield
of total crystallinity in this series is slightly higher than that
in series A, and after 56 days, the sample contains more than 50%
crystalline material.

Figure 5a shows
how the relative amount of each crystal phase changes with synthesis
time in series C, where the initial titania precursor concentration
is 1.12 M. The relative weight fraction of rutile is 77% after 7 days
and decreases to 55% after 56 days. Between 7 and 56 days, the concentration
of brookite increases from 15 to 37%, but the increase in anatase
concentration is much lower from 7 to 9%. Although the trend of decreasing
fraction of rutile with increasing synthesis time is observed, similar
as for series A and B, the rutile fraction is much higher in series
C than those of the other two series throughout the synthesis time.

Figure 5b shows
the yield of each phase in series C. The inset figure shows the total
yield of the reaction, which is 85% after 56 days. In the graph, it
can be seen that of the three crystal phases, mainly rutile has formed
after 7 day synthesis time, and it continues to form during the whole
synthesis time. Lesser amounts of anatase and brookite are formed
until 32 days, but between day 32 and 56, more brookite is formed.
Here, the amorphous phase is formed until 32 days after which it decreases
significantly, and its yield is half of the total crystallinity after
56 days. This decrease in the amorphous phase after 32 days, accompanied
with a quite rapid increase in a brookite yield, indicates that it
may be converted mainly to the brookite phase.

The results from
series B and C confirm our hypothesis that the
concentration of molecular titania precursor species influences the
polymorph selectivity, where high concentration favors rutile and
low concentration favors brookite and anatase. To explain the driving
force for the polymorph selectivity in the three series, we need to
understand how the chemical composition of the reaction mixtures changes
as the reaction proceeds. The most obvious change is that as solid
titania particles are formed, the concentration of the dissolved molecular
titania precursor species in the solution decreases. To illustrate
the effect that this has on the selectivity, the relative accumulated
weight fraction of phases formed from the start of the syntheses is
presented in Figure 6 as a function of the instantaneous concentration of soluble titania
precursor for all three series. The instantaneous concentration of
soluble titania precursor in the solution at the sampling points is
calculated by subtracting the amount of titania precursor that has
been converted to solid phases from the initial titania precursor
used in each series. The instantaneous concentration of soluble titania
precursor used in the graph is the average between two subsequent
sampling points. Differentiating the total crystallinity into the
three crystalline polymorphs reveals that the selectivity of their
formation strongly depends on the instantaneous titania precursor
concentration in the solution. From the data, it is obvious that under
the synthesis conditions employed here, the selectivity for rutile
formation is highest when the titania precursor concentration is high.
As the instantaneous concentration of the precursor decreases, the
selectivity changes in favor of brookite at intermediate and low concentrations.
The selectivity for anatase is low throughout the synthesis but increases
somewhat at low precursor concentrations. In all three series, it
was observed that the material formed is partly amorphous. From the
data, we cannot, however, unambiguously distinguish clear trends of
the relative fraction of amorphous versus the total crystalline material
with instantaneous precursor concentration.

Figure 6 Relative accumulated
weight fraction of rutile (blue), brookite
(green), and anatase (red) in series A (squares), series B (circles),
and series C (diamonds) formed from the start of the syntheses as
a function of the instantaneous concentration of soluble titania precursor.

As a further attempt to illustrate
the selectivity dependence on
the precursor concentration, the formation rate of the polymorphs
is plotted versus the instantaneous concentration of soluble titania
precursor in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. Although the data is scattered due to uncertainty in quantifying
the amorphous phase and the relatively small changes in phase composition
between sampling points, it confirms the selectivity dependence discussed
above.

It should be noted that the proton concentration in the
solution
also changes as the reaction proceeds. Initially, when the titanium
butoxide is added to the acidic solution, it is rapidly hydrolyzed,
and due to excess water in the reaction mixture, the precursor is
expected to be fully hydrolyzed.28 Under
the acidic conditions in the system studied here, where hydroxo-aquo
precursor species are present, the condensation reaction will proceed
mainly via olation, leading to formation of hydroxo bridges (Ti–OH–Ti).29 As the condensation reactions proceed and titanium
dioxide particles form, the oxygen bridge will not carry a proton
in the final structure, and the proton will be released to the solution,
decreasing its pH. This was confirmed by monitoring the pH of the
solution, which decreased with increasing synthesis time in all three
series. The parallel change in proton and soluble titania precursor
concentrations complicates the interpretation of the polymorph distribution
and selectivity data. It has previously been shown, however, that
under similar conditions as used here, a lower pH favors formation
of rutile.14,15 We, therefore, conclude that
the shift in selectivity to brookite and anatase toward the end of
the syntheses found in Figures 2, 4, and 5 is
not due to the decrease in pH. Instead, the selectivity change appears
due to the decrease in instantaneous concentration of soluble titania
precursor according to Figure 6. The observation of an initial selectivity for rutile phase
formation and a later preference for brookite and anatase phases is
contradictory to the more commonly observed scenario where rutile
forms with slower crystallization rates and where rapid crystallization
favors anatase formation, usually attributed to kinetic formation
of anatase crystals and thermodynamic formation of the rutile crystal
structure.24

To further understand
the mechanism of formation of the different
polymorphs in the present system, we extracted the crystallite sizes
from the Rietveld refinements and found that they were below 11 nm.
More specifically, the size of the rutile crystallites was estimated
to be 5.6–7.2 nm, and the crystals appear not to grow further
in size during the synthesis time where the brookite crystallites
were 2.5–5 nm and the anatase crystallites were 2.5–5.6
nm with a small variation in size with synthesis time. Below 11 nm
in size, anatase and brookite have been predicted to be more thermodynamically
stable than rutile.16,20 If the polymorph formation was
thermodynamically controlled, it would be expected that mainly brookite
and anatase would crystallize in this size range. To characterize
the morphology and further evaluate the crystalline phases present
in the samples, HRTEM imaging and SAED were used. Figure 7 shows HRTEM images of sample
A1 (3 day synthesis time). The images clearly show lattice fringes,
and images in Figure 7a,b show that the size of the needle-shaped crystals is about 10
nm. Figure 7c shows
a bundle of crystals that are superimposed on each other, and the
elongated crystals are roughly aligned along their long axis. The
black arrows denote the direction that they are aligned, and from
the fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffractogram (inset), it can be
seen that the alignment of the crystals is along their c-axis. The arc-shaped (110) reflection corresponds to a misorientation
along the [110] direction that was measured to 13.5°. Indexing
the FFT confirms the TiO2 phase as rutile, in agreement
with XRD analysis.

magnification
HRTEM image of sample A1 (3 day synthesis time). In (a), the arrows
denote the [001] direction aligned with the crystal long axes. (c)
Image shows that the sample consists of needles that are roughly along
the c-axis (denoted by the black arrows), and the
inset is the FFT diffractogram showing that the majority of the crystals
are oriented along the [1̅10] zone axis.

Figure 8 shows
TEM
images and SAED patterns of sample A9 (56 day synthesis time). The
average size of the crystals is 4.5 ± 1.5 nm. The sample appears
to be a combination of crystals of very small (2.7 nm) and slightly
larger (8.5 nm) sizes, which are shown in Figure 8a, by purple and blue arrows, respectively.
The sample consists of particles that appear to be of spherical morphology
and of polycrystalline nature is revealed by the ring SAED pattern.
Indexing the SAED pattern also shows that the phase of the sample
is brookite, which is in good agreement with the XRD analysis where
the relative fraction of brookite in the sample was estimated to be
70%. The d-spacing values were measured and are denoted
in Figure 8c. In addition,
the morphology of the crystals shown in the TEM images in Figures 7 and 8 corroborates the morphology obtained by the Rietveld analysis
of the diffractograms (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Figure 8 (a, c) HRTEM images and (b) SAED pattern of sample A9
(56 day synthesis
time). Image (a) shows that the sample is polycrystalline, and purple
arrows denote small crystals, whereas cyan arrows denote bigger crystals.
The SAED ring pattern corresponds to the brookite phase. A high magnification
of the sample is shown in (c) where the d-spacing
values were measured and the brookite lattice planes are denoted.

Figure 9 shows TEM
images of sample A5 (14 day synthesis time). The morphology of the
sample appears to be a mixture of the previous two samples. The sample
consists of areas of elongated needle-shaped crystals (as in the 3
day sample) and areas of almost round particles (as in the 56 day
sample). This is in agreement with the Rietveld analysis of the X-ray
diffractograms where the samples were found to contain two main phases,
rutile and brookite.

Figure 9 Bright field TEM images of sample A5, 14 day synthesis
time (a)

part of the image, and (b) in high resolution. The sample shows mixture
of randomly oriented spherical crystals and needle-shape crystals.
In (a), the arrows denote the direction of the needle-shaped crystals
and in (b), the arrows denote some of the spherical-shaped crystals.

The TEM characterization is in
good agreement with the XRD analysis,
supporting the observation that initially the rutile phase is formed
and the other phases are formed when the instantaneous precursor concentration
decreases. Moreover, our results show that the rutile phase is not
converted to the anatase and brookite phases, but that they form independently
of the rutile phase. This is supported by the observation that the
yield of the rutile phase does not decrease with synthesis time, as
brookite and anatase are formed. A more probable explanation is that
other chemical pathways become more feasible as the chemical environment
changes as the reaction proceeds, leading to formation of the more
thermodynamically stable anatase and brookite nanoparticle phases.

Conclusions
A low-temperature low-pH synthesis of titania was studied, and
the effect of precursor concentration on polymorph selectivity was
evaluated. During the reaction, rutile is initially formed, whereas
brookite and anatase are preferentially formed at later stages. It
was confirmed that a solid–solid transformation of rutile to
anatase or brookite phases is improbable under reaction conditions,
that anatase and brookite formations occur instead from unreacted
precursors in the solution, and that the time dependent polymorph
selectivity is instead related to changes in the chemical environment
of the system. At high titania precursor concentration, mainly rutile
was formed, but as the concentration decreases, brookite and anatase
are favored.

Experimental Methods
Reagent mixtures
were prepared using hydrochloric acid (37% Sigma-Aldrich),
ethanol (99.5% Solveco), and titanium n-butoxide
(97% Sigma-Aldrich). Three series of samples, with varying concentrations
of titanium n-butoxide, were prepared. In series
A, 1.5 g of 5 M HCl, 3 g of ethanol, and 1.5 g of titanium n-butoxide were added to a 20 mL glass vial. The glass vial
was capped, and the content shaken until the mixture became clear
after which the vial was placed in an oven at 40 °C. After the
chosen synthesis time, the sample mixture was removed, and the formed
titania particles were retrieved and washed three times by ultracentrifugation
using Beckman Coulter Ultracentrifuge Optima 100XL with a Type 90
Ti fixed angle rotor at 25000g for 1 h. The particles
were then dried at 40 °C in an oven. Each sample is composed
of the combined products from 4 to 10 vials. Series B and C were prepared
in similar ways, but in series B, 1.5 g of 5 M HCl, 3.6 g of ethanol,
and 0.75 g of titanium n-butoxide were used, and
in series C, 1.5 g of 5 M HCl, 2.1 g of ethanol, and 2.6 g of titanium n-butoxide were used.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
measurements were conducted on
a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer with Cu Kα source (1.54056
Å) using the Bragg–Brentano optics. The Rietveld refinements
were performed using Fullprof software.21 The background was described by a four-coefficient Chebyshev polynomial
function. The site occupancies, positions, and atomic displacement
parameters were fixed to literature values.22,23 The peak profiles were described using the Thompson–Cox–Hastings
pseudo-Voight function. To model the anisotropic size broadening,
a linear combination of maximum four spherical harmonic functions
was used. A LaB6 NIST standard, measured at the same conditions,
was modeled to obtain the instrumental broadening. Quantitative XRD
measurements were performed on all samples, by adding a small known
amount of diamond to the sample as an internal standard.

For
structural characterization, selected area electron diffraction
(SAED), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
were employed. The samples were crushed in a mortar, dispersed in
ethanol, dropped onto a carbon-coated cupper grid, and let dry at
room temperature. The experiments were performed on a Tecnai G2 microscope,
operating at 200 kV.
