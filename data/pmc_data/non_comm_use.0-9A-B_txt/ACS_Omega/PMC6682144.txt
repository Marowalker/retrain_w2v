Salinity gradients
are a vast and untapped energy resource. For
every cubic meter of freshwater that mixes with seawater, approximately
0.65 kW h of theoretically recoverable energy is lost. For coastal
wastewater treatment plants that discharge to the ocean, this energy,
if recovered, could power the plant. The mixing entropy battery (MEB)
uses battery electrodes to convert salinity gradient energy into electricity
in a four-step process: (1) freshwater exchange; (2) charging in freshwater;
(3) seawater exchange; and (4) discharging in seawater. Previously,
we demonstrated a proof of concept, but with electrode materials that
required an energy investment during the charging step. Here, we introduce
a charge-free MEB with low-cost electrodes: Prussian Blue (PB) and
polypyrrole (PPy). Importantly, this MEB requires no energy investment,
and the electrode materials are stable with repeated cycling. The
MEB equipped with PB and PPy achieved high voltage ratios (actual
voltages obtained divided by the theoretical voltages) of 89.5% in
wastewater effluent and 97.6% in seawater, with over 93% capacity
retention after 50 cycles of operation and 97–99% over 150
cycles with a polyvinyl alcohol/sulfosuccinic acid (PVA/SSA) coating
on the PB electrode.

==== Body
Introduction
Salinity gradient energy,
also referred to as “blue energy”,
exists in estuaries when freshwater and seawater mix. Globally, the
potential blue energy from mixing river water with seawater is estimated
as 2 TW.1 Tapping these sources of blue
energy would be challenging. A feasible starting point would be wastewater
treatment plants that already discharge to saline environments. Current
wastewater treatment is energy-intensive, accounting for 3% of the
nation’s electrical energy load.2 For coastal treatment plants, a significant untapped source of energy
is the salinity difference between treated wastewater (∼30
mM NaCl) and the ocean (∼600 mM NaCl). This salinity gradient
creates a theoretically recoverable energy of 0.65 kW h per m3 of freshwater.3 Globally, the
theoretically recoverable energy from wastewater treatment plants
is estimated at 18 GW.1 Using a small mixing
entropy battery (MEB), we recovered 0.44 kW h/m3 (68% efficiency)
by alternately flushing a series of MEBs with treated wastewater effluent
with seawater.3 If a similar efficiency
can be achieved at full-scale, the energy produced would be sufficient
to meet much or even all of the electrical energy demands for conventional
wastewater treatment of 0.4–0.65 kW h/m3 (ref (4)).

Previous researchers
have sought to recover salt gradient energy
through a range of means. The most tested are pressure retarded osmosis
(PRO)1,4−12 and reverse electrodialysis (RED).bib11,10−23 Neither has yet achieved commercial viability. Membrane-free methods
include vapor compression,24 technology
based on swelling and shrinking of hydrogels,25 and the capacitive mixing (CAPMIX) family of technologies,26−30 including a device based on capacitive double layer expansion (CDLE),31,32 devices based on the capacitive Donnan potential (CDP),33−37 and the MEB.3,38,39

In the MEB, electrodes are alternately flushed with seawater
and
freshwater. In these exchanges, Na+ and Cl– ions migrate into and out of the electrodes, driving redox changes
within the electrodes and transfer of electrons through an external
circuit from one electrode to the other. In a proof-of-concept study,
we tested the MEB with real wastewater effluent and real seawater,
using a sodium manganese oxide (NMO) cationic electrode and Ag/AgCl
anionic electrode.3 Although energy recovery
efficiency was high (68%), there were several drawbacks: (1) the Ag/AgCl
electrode was costly and soluble in seawater; (2) the NMO electrode
was also costly and had a low specific capacity; and (3) operation
of the MEB required a charging step with an upfront energy investment,
increasing the complexity of operation.

In this study, we introduce
a charge-free MEB enabled by low-cost
electrode materials. Prussian Blue (PB) is used as the cationic electrode
material. PB and its analogues have an open-framework structure with
a general formula of AxPR(CN)6·nH2O, in which R(CN)6 is a hexacyanometallate group forming the cubic structure; P is
a transition metal cation; and A is the interstitial site, which can
be occupied by alkali cations. The open-framework structure allows
fast insertion/extraction of alkali cations into/from the interstitial
sites. Using PB and its analogues as electrode materials, researchers
have achieved >1000 cycles of stable operation in aqueous electrolyte
batteries,40−42 and PB is widely used as a pigment and medicine at
a cost of <$1/kg. For the anionic electrode material, we selected
polypyrrole (PPy). Researchers have explored the use of PPy with p-type
doping as an electrode material in batteries,43,44 chloride ion sensors,45 and deionization
devices,46 at a bulk industrial cost of
<$3/kg. These applications have demonstrated capacity for reversible
redox reactions with Cl– and changes in the PPy
potential that correlate with Cl– concentration.45 By matching potentials of the PPy electrode
with those of the PB electrode, we were able to eliminate energy investment
in the charge step. The result is a charge-free MEB with inexpensive
electrode materials.

Results and Discussion
The MEB recovers
energy through a four-step cycle (Figure 1A). Step 1 is a rapid exchange
of seawater by wastewater effluent. During Step 2, Na+ and
Cl– are released from the electrodes into the solution,
and the current flows from the anionic electrode to the cationic electrode.
Step 3 is a rapid exchange of wastewater effluent by seawater. During
Step 4, Na+ and Cl– are reincorporated
into the electrodes, and the current flow reverses. In all prior studies
of the MEB, the potential of the cationic electrode was greater than
the potential of the anionic electrode, resulting in positive MEB
voltage throughout the cycle. Step 2 was thermodynamically unfavorable
in previous work3,38 and thus required an energy input
because the current flows from the electrode with lower potential
to the one with higher potential. Step 4 was thermodynamically favorable,
allowing energy recovery. Overall, net energy recovery results because
the energy invested in Step 2 is less than the energy recovered in
Step 4.3 However, the upfront energy investment
requires an additional power supply and charge controller and makes
the system more expensive and complex.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic of the
MEB and the four-step energy recovery cycle;
(B) energy recovery cycle of the charge-free MEB equipped with a PB
cationic electrode and a PPy anionic electrode flushed with real seawater
and wastewater effluent.

The energy investment in Step 2 can be avoided by matching
electrode
materials in such a way that the battery voltage is positive during
the seawater flush and becomes negative during the freshwater flush
(Figure 1B). When flushed
with freshwater (Step 1), the voltage becomes negative. In Step 2,
ions are released with no energy investment, and current flows spontaneously
from the anionic electrode to the cationic electrode. In Step 3, seawater
displaces the freshwater, and the voltage becomes positive. In Step
4, ions spontaneously leave the solution phase and enter the electrodes.
Current reverses direction, spontaneously flowing from the cationic
electrode to the anionic electrode (Step 4). Energy is thus recovered
during both the freshwater flush (43.6% of the total energy recovered)
and the seawater flush (56.4% of the total energy recovered), with
no upfront energy investment. The discrepancy between the energy capture
between the freshwater and seawater are a result of a reduced electrolyte
resistance in seawater, leading to lower ohmic resistance and greater
net energy capture. To enable charge-free MEB operation, the potential
of the cationic electrode and anionic electrode should be chosen to
enable reversible discharge to a final voltage of zero.

Cationic Electrode
In this study, we chose PB as the
cationic electrode material, in which R(CN)6 is Fe2+(CN)6, and P is Fe3+ (Figure 2A). PB was synthesized by a
solution-based reaction by mixing a 0.5 M FeCl3 solution
with a 0.5 M Na3Fe(CN)6 solution at pH = 2 (see
the Supporting Information for the detailed
process). This reaction yields PB in its oxidized state (also called
Berlin Green). We chose to synthesize Prussian Blue in its oxidized
state because this state is easier to synthesize in a crystalline
form. The synthesized PB sample was then coated onto a carbon cloth
current collector with a slurry coating method (see the Supporting Information for the detailed process).
Because PB can become unstable and solubilize at neutral pH, a Na+-permeable polyvinyl alcohol/sulfosuccinic acid (PVA/SSA)
coating was also used to prevent particle loss (see the Supporting Information for the coating procedure). Figure 2B shows the SEM image
of a carbon cloth electrode coated with the synthesized PB particles.
The particle size is around 500 nm. Figure 2C shows the cyclic voltammetry of the PB
electrode in a 0.6 M NaCl solution. We observed two redox couple peaks
(Peak 1 at 0.22 V and Peak 2 at 0.9 V on Figure 2C) during both the oxidation sweep and reduction
sweep. Peak 1 indicates the reaction between the more reduced Na2FeII[FeII(CN)6] (to the left
of Peak 1) and NaFeIII[FeII(CN)6]
(to the right of Peak 1). Peak 2 indicates the reaction between NaFeIII[FeII(CN)6] (to the left of Peak 2)
and FeIII[FeIII(CN)6] (to the right
of Peak 2). At higher potentials, the oxidation peak and reduction
peak are not symmetric, indicating irreversible oxidation to FeIII[FeIII(CN)6] and dissolution of PB.
To avoid this irreversible reaction, the PB electrode must be cycled
at a potential less than 0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl.

allowing insertion and extraction of Na+; (B) scanning
electron microscopy image of the PB electrode; (C) cyclic voltammetry
of the PB electrode in a 0.6 M NaCl solution; (D) galvanostatic cycle
of the PB electrode in a 0.6 M NaCl solution; (E) cycling performance
of the PB electrode, showing the coulombic efficiency and discharge
capacity over 50 cycles; (F) PB electrode potential changed with different
NaCl concentrations (0.024, 0.3, 0.6, 1, and 2 M).

Figure 2D illustrates
the reproducible galvanostatic cycle of the PB electrode between 0
and 0.3 V. The fixed slope is evidence of a single-phase reaction. Figure 2E shows the cycling
performance of the PB electrode in a 0.6 M NaCl solution. During this
test, the PB electrode was charged and discharged between 0 and 0.3
V at a constant current of 2 mA for 50 times. The coulombic efficiency
was close to 100% (ranging from 99.9 to 100.6%) with 93% capacity
retention after 50 cycles. We also tested the sensitivity of PB electrode
potential to NaCl concentration change. As shown in Figure 2F, the PB electrode potential
increased from 0.133 to 0.248 V when the NaCl concentration increased
from 0.024 to 2 M, close to the theoretical values calculated from
the Nernst equation (see the Supporting Information for calculation details). The response is quick, with the potential
stabilizing within 10 s or less after the solution exchange at all
NaCl concentrations tested. To prevent attrition of PB with long-term
use, a PVA/SSA coating on the PB electrode showed improved capacity
retention over 150 cycles (approximately 15 days of continuous cycling),
seen in Figure S1. The columbic efficiency
remained at ∼100%, while the capacity retention was 96% for
the initial 50 cycles, 97% from 50th to 150th cycle and 99% from 100th
to 150th cycle. A PVA concentration of at least 10% was required in
the coating, otherwise an adverse effect on coulombic efficiency was
observed (Figure S2).

Anionic Electrode
The PPy electrode was synthesized
by electrochemically polymerizing pyrrole onto a carbon cloth current
collector, using a supporting solution with 0.1 M pyrrole and 1 M
NaCl (see the Supporting Information for
the detailed process). Figure 3A shows the doping/undoping process of PPy by Cl–. Figure 3B shows
the SEM image of the PPy electrode with the polymer coated uniformly
around the carbon cloth fibers. Figure 3C shows the cyclic voltammetry of the PPy electrode.
One peak occurred during oxidation (0.4 V) and two peaks occurred
during reduction (−0.25 and −1.1 V). This is consistent
with the findings of Yongfang et al. that PPy has two doping sites.47 The oxidation peak (0.4 V) and reduction peak
(−0.25 V) indicate the reversible deinsertion and reinsertion
of anions (Cl– in this case) at the traditional
doping site with positively charged conjugated chains. The reduction
peak at lower potential corresponds to doping at the second site with
the protonated pyrrole unit. The second reduction disrupts the conjugated
chain and thus decreased the conductivity of PPy.

Figure 3 (A) Cl– doping and undoping on PPy; (B) scanning
electron microscopy image of a carbon cloth electrode coated with
PPy by electrochemical polymerization; (C) cyclic voltammetry of the
PPy electrode in a 0.6 M NaCl solution; (D) galvanostatic cycle of
the PPy electrode in a 0.6 M NaCl solution; (E) cycling performance
of the PPy electrode: showing the coulombic efficiency and discharge
capacity over 50 cycles; and (F) PPy electrode potential changed with
different NaCl concentrations (0.024, 0.3, 0.6, 1, and 2 M).

As an anionic electrode in a charge-free
MEB, the potential of
the PPy electrode should match that of the PB cationic electrode.
When cycled within the same range (0–0.3 V) as the PB electrode,
doping at the second site is avoided. Figure 3D shows the galvanostatic potential profile
of the PPy electrode in a 0.6 M NaCl solution. In the potential range
between 0 and 0.3 V, the only reaction at the PPy electrode is doping/undoping
of Cl– at the first site, so no change in slope
is observed. The PPy electrode also showed excellent cycling performance
in this potential range with close to 100% coulombic efficiency (ranging
from 95.7 to 97.8%) and 92% capacity retention through 50 cycles (Figure 3E). We also tested
the sensitivity of PPy electrode potential to NaCl concentration:
as the NaCl concentration increased from 0.024 to 2 M, the PPy electrode
potential decreased from 0.294 to 0.211 V (Figure 3F). This change was close to the theoretical
value calculated from the Nernst equation, and the response was quick,
stabilizing within 10 s after the solution exchange.

Full Cell
Both the PB electrode and PPy electrode exhibited
excellent electrochemical properties within an overlapping potential
range. To test the feasibility of the charge-free concept, we constructed
a plate-shaped MEB with the PB electrode as the cationic electrode
and the PPy electrode as the anionic electrode (see Figure S3 for
photographs and the Supporting Information for the detailed process). The battery was connected to a 300 Ω
resistor. A potentiostat (Bio-logic SP-50) was used to monitor energy
production. During MEB operation, we flushed the cell with alternating
hourly exchanges of wastewater effluent and seawater. The freshwater
was treated wastewater effluent from the Palo Alto Regional Water
Quality Control Plant (0.032 M salinity), and the seawater was collected
from the Pacific Ocean at Half Moon Bay, CA (0.6 M salinity). Both
the PB electrode and the PPy electrode were precycled to the same
potential (0.15 V) in seawater as the starting point. A full-cell
energy recovery cycle of the charge-free MEB is shown in Figure 1B. The cycle begins
at Point A where the potentials of the PB electrode and the PPy electrode
are the same in seawater, giving a full-cell voltage close to 0 V.
In Step 1, we replace the electrolyte with wastewater effluent. Because
the salinity decreases, the MEB voltage decreases to −130 mV
(Point B). In Step 2, the MEB discharges in wastewater effluent until
the potentials of the two electrodes become approximately equal (Point
C). In Step 3, we replace the electrolyte with seawater, and the MEB
voltage increases to +130 mV (Point D). In Step 4, the MEB discharges
in seawater until the potentials of the two electrodes again become
approximately equal. For each complete cycle, we recover 107 mJ (calculated
from the integration of voltage–charge plot), corresponding
to 7.4 kJ per mol of intercalated ion. This value is lower than the
16.8 kJ mol–1 reported previously,48 although we utilize a lower concentration of saline water
(0.6 M vs 3.0 M NaCl). Our study also shows 4–5 orders of magnitude
more energy captured per cycle normalized to electrode surface area
(80–100 mJ per cycle with 9 cm2 electrodes in our
study, compared to 0.1–0.7 mJ with 1 cm2 electrodes48). The voltage ratios in our study were 89.5%
in wastewater effluent and 97.6% in seawater, similar to those obtained
previously using a MEB equipped with NMO and Ag/AgCl electrodes.3 For single-cycle experiments, net energy recovery
efficiency varied from 5 to 11% per cycle, depending on cycle duration
(Figure S4). If these cells were connected
in series, as in our previous study3 with
NMO-Ag/AgCl, we would expect a similar maximum energy recovery efficiency
(68%). The PVA/SSA coating did not impact overall energy recovery,
with 72–151 mJ recovered per cycle, depending on the wastewater
salinity (Figure S5).

The maximum
power output of 63 mW/m2 occurs immediately after solution
exchange from freshwater to seawater. The average power output during
the four-step cycle was 16 mW/m2. This power output is
lower than membrane-dependent technologies (PRO and RED), or MEB/membrane
hybrid-technologies,37,39,49 but comparable to other technologies in the CAPMIX family: the maximum
power in a CDLE based device is 18 mW/m2 immediately after
the start of discharge;32 the maximum power
in a CDP based device is 60–200 mW/m2.33,36 The power output was not optimized in this study and could be improved
by taking measures to minimize the internal resistance, such as use
of a more conductive current collector and improved reactor design
or by matching the resistance of the external circuit with the internal
resistance (we used a 300 Ω external resistor, whereas other
studies have used external resistance < 10 Ω). While power
output is still low per electrode area, process footprint and scale-up
are more feasible with the charge-free device because of the simplicity
of the process: energy is produced in both Step 2 and Step 4 with
no requirements for membranes, charge controllers, or a potentiostat.

Finally, we evaluated long-term performance of the charge-free
MEB with PB and PPy electrodes (Figure 4A). Both the PB and PPy electrodes were operated within
the stability window. The MEB was stable for 50 cycles (Figure 4B) with less than 7% decrease
in energy recovery. This capacity loss was mainly due to detachment
of active materials because both PB and PPy were cycled within the
stability potential window. The PVA/SSA coating significantly improved
capacity retention by preventing attrition of active materials; capacity
retention was greater than 97% over 180 cycles with the coating (Figure S6).

Figure 4 Cycling performance of the charge-free
MEB: (A) voltage profile
of the MEB operated for 50 cycles; (B) energy recovery of the MEB
over 50 cycles.

We conclude that a MEB
device is feasible without the requirement
of a charging step, greatly simplifying the process, with better feasibility
of scale-up. PB and PPy are ideal candidates as cationic and anionic
electrode materials for the charge-free MEB. Both have low cost, an
overlapping potential range, sensitivity to NaCl concentration change,
and excellent cycling performance and stability in aqueous solution.
