Reaction of Cu(hfac)2 with
methyl- and bromo-3-pyridyl-substituted
nitronyl nitroxides (LR) leads to assemble
a diverse set of coordination complexes: mononuclear [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me], binuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me], trinuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2], pentanuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2], and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4], cocrystals [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·[Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] and [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·2[Cu(hfac)2H2O], one-dimensional polymers [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n and
[Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n, and cyclic dimers [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, and [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2. The molecular
structures of the obtained complexes are strongly affected by the
substituent type and its location in the pyridine heterocycle. Occupation
of the second position of the pyridine ring increases the steric hindrance
of both imine and nitroxide coordination sites of L2-R, which is favorable for the formation of various conformers
and precipitation of complexes with different molecular structures.
The pentanuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] complexes do not have
prior analogues and are valuable model objects for investigation of
the mechanism of formation of various coordination polymers. The arrangement
of long Cu–ONO bonds in {CuO6} square
bipyramids due to the weakening nitroxide donor site in complexes,
based on L2-Me, L2-Br, and L6-Br ligands, results
in ferromagnetic exchange interactions between spins of Cu2+ ions and nitroxides. Complexes with substituents that do not considerably
affect the coordination ability of ligands (L5-Me, L5-Br, and L6-Me) exhibit strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between
spins of Cu2+ ions and nitroxides.

Introduction
The study of the effect
of ligand structure modification on molecular
and crystal structures of the resulting complexes is an important
aspect of the rational design of materials with desirable structure
and functional properties. Copper(II) complexes with nitroxide radicals
are unique objects for studying the peculiarities of magnetic exchange
pathways between different types of paramagnetic centers.1,2 The magnetic behavior of Cu(II)–nitroxide heterospin systems
strongly correlates with the geometry of the coordination sphere of
Cu2+ Jahn–Teller ions, which is substantially affected
by the molecular structure of the nitroxide ligand. The equatorial
coordination of the nitroxide group (NO group) results in strong antiferromagnetic
Cu2+-radical exchange coupling (J ≪
0), whereas axial binding leads to ferromagnetic exchange interactions
(J > 0).1−3 There are several well-known factors
that may favor one of the geometries.2 Equatorial
coordination is often preferred because of the additional stabilization
in the case of spin pairing. Presence of other strong coordination
sites in the side chain of ligand forces the axial binding of the
NO group. Steric factors and intermolecular interactions between uncoordinated
NO groups can favor both axial and equatorial coordination types,
depending on the molecular structure and crystal packing of the resulting
compounds. In some cases, the energy gap between equatorial and axial
coordination is very weak, which allows the magnetic exchange interactions
to be switched by changing the temperature, pressure, or light irradiation.1−12

However, only a few Cu(II) complexes with nitroxides exhibit
structural-magnetic
anomalies under external stimuli.1−24 Even a minor modification of a ligand leads to significant changes
in the molecular and crystal structures of the resulting Cu(II) complexes.
This strongly affects the parameters of magnetic transitions and can
result in the assembly of phases that cannot exhibit any magnetostructural
anomalies.5,7−13,23,24 Cu(hfac)2 complexes with various derivatives of 3-pyridyl-substituted
nitronyl nitroxide (L) are of particular interest due to the diversity
of molecular species and their magnetic properties (Scheme 1).4,7,12,16−18,25,26 Introduction of a Me group in the 4th position of the pyridine ring
for L4-Me nitronyl nitroxide has led
to the formation of Cu(II) complexes with structure and magnetic properties
completely different from those of the [{Cu(hfac)2}4L2] compound based on the unsubstituted ligand.4,12 Recently described copper(II) and mixed-metal copper(II)-lanthanide
complexes with L5-Br and L6-OMe nitronyl nitroxides have demonstrated various
topological structures and different magnetic behaviors in the absence
of structural and magnetic transitions.16−18,25,26 However, the effect of substituents
at different positions of the pyridine ring on the coordination ability
of 3-pyridyl nitronyl nitroxide ligand, structure, and magnetic behaviors
of the resulting Cu(II) complexes has not been studied systematically.
Therefore, the Me group and Br atom were chosen as substituents for
the 2nd, 5th, or 6th positions of the pyridine heterocycle of LR nitroxide, because both of them have the same
spatial size but different electronic properties (Scheme 1).27 This approach allowed us to trace the general relationship between
the donor ability of nitroxide coordination sites and the molecular
structure of resulting complexes, as well as a substitution effect
on magnetostructural correlations inherent in their nature.

Scheme 1 Structures
of Cu(hfac)2 and Methyl- and Bromo-3-pyridyl-substituted
Nitronyl Nitroxides (LR)
Results and Discussion
Nitronyl nitroxides LR (R = Me, Br) were
synthesized by condensation of the corresponding aldehydes with 2,3-bis(hydroxyamino)-2,3-dimethylbutane
and subsequent oxidation of the resulting adduct with PbO2 according to a well-established approach derived from Ullman’s
work.28−30 The spin-labeled LR (R =
2-Me, 2-Br, 5-Me, 5-Br, 6-Br) were successfully isolated as single
crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figures 1S–3S and Table 1S). It was shown
that the N–•O bond lengths are typical for
nitronyl nitroxides (1.27–1.28 Å).30

Reaction of synthesized Me- and Br-substituted nitronyl
nitroxides
with Cu(hfac)2 resulted in obtaining new heterospin coordination
complexes: mononuclear [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me], binuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me], trinuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2], pentanuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4], cocrystals [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·[Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] and [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·2[Cu(hfac)2H2O], one-dimensional polymers [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n and [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n, and cyclic dimers [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, and [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2. Interestingly,
only one main product was obtained in the reactions of the 5th- and
6th-substituted nitronyl nitroxides, whereas L2-Me and L2-Br radicals generated
several different complexes depending on the synthetic conditions
and reagent ratio. Some of the resulting complexes are kinetic products
and crystallized as admixtures. [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me], [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4], [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·2[Cu(hfac)2H2O], and [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2] complexes were obtained in small amounts and could not be manually
separated because of the small size of crystals and similar appearance
to the main product. This allowed us to study only their crystal structures.

The main reaction product of Cu(hfac)2 and L2-Me in a 1:1 ratio is the mononuclear [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me] complex. The crystal
structure comprises two crystallographically independent Cu(hfac)2L2-Me molecules (Figure 1a) with slightly different
bond lengths and angles. The coordination environment of Cu atoms
in both molecules is square pyramidal, where one of the Ohfac atoms is at the apex, and the base is formed by the other three
Ohfac atoms and the NPy atom (Cu–NPy = 2.003(9) and 2.021(8) Å; Figure 1a and Table 2S). The nearest ONO···ONO distances
between uncoordinated NO groups of neighboring [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me] molecules is 3.659(11) Å.

Figure 1 Structures
of (a) [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me]
(dashed line represents the shortest distances ONO···ONO between the molecules), (b) [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2], (c) [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4], and (d) [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me] (H atoms, geminal
CH3 groups of L2-Me, and
CF3 groups of hfac ligands are omitted for clarity).

The χMT in the
temperature range
15–300 K for [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me] is 0.81 cm3·K·mol–1 (Figure 2a), in good
agreement with the corresponding contribution of weakly correlated
spins S = 1/2 of Cu2+ ion and nitroxide.
The decrease of χMT below 15 K indicates
weak antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between spin sites. According
to the XRD data, JR–R in the pair
of neighboring [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me] molecules could be a channel of exchange interactions. The
experimental χMT(T) dependence is well approximated by an equation including the corresponding
contribution from the {>N–•O···O•–N<} intermolecular exchange clusters of
the pair of [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me] molecules (H = −2JR–RSRASRB) using the PHI program.31 The weakly interacting spins of the Cu2+ ions that coordinate
the donor NPy atoms were introduced in the analysis by
using the Curie law. The obtained optimum parameters of magnetic exchange
interactions gR = 2.00 (fixed), gCu2+ = 2.25, JR–R = −2.49 cm–1, and zJ′ = −0.09 cm–1 are in
good agreement with the hypothetical scheme of the intermolecular
exchange interactions.

red solid thick lines represent the data calculated based on optimized
parameters.

Dark-red crystals of pentanuclear
[{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] complex are reproducibly
obtained when the ratio of reagents Cu(hfac)2/L2-Me increases to 5:2. The molecular structure
of the [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] complex consists of five Cu(hfac)2 fragments connected by two L2-Me (Figure 1b). The vertices
of the square bipyramidal coordination environment of the central
Cucent atom are occupied by the ONO atoms (Cucent–ONO = 2.481(2) Å; Table 2S). The coordination environment of the four terminal
Cuter atoms is a square pyramid, where the donor atom NPy of L2-Me occupies the axial
position in the {CuO4N} coordination units (Cuter–NPy = 2.302(2) Å) and ONO atoms
are in equatorial planes of the {CuO5} square pyramids
(Cuter–ONO = 1.953(2) Å).

At 300 K, the χMT for [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] is 1.22 cm3·K·mol–1 and
does not change significantly when the temperature is lowered to 10
K (Figure 2b). The
experimental dependence of χMT(T) was analyzed using the PHI program31 with the contribution of {Cu2+A-JCuR-RA-J′CuR-Cu2+C-J′CuR-RB-JCuR-Cu2+B} five-spin fragments (H = −2JCuR(SCuASRA + SCuBSRB) – 2J′CuR(SRASCuC + SCuCSRB)). The weakly interacting spins of the Cu2+ ions that coordinate with the donor NPy atoms were introduced
in the analysis by using the Curie law. The optimal values of the
exchange parameters, gR = 2.00 (fixed), gCu2+ = 2.06, JCuR = −842 cm–1, J′CuR = +57 cm–1, and zJ′ = +0.01 cm–1, indicate the
strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the spins of
terminal Cu2+ ions and nitroxides in the {CuO5} coordination units due to direct overlapping of their magnetic
orbitals. The almost-constant χMT value in the temperature range 10–300 K is in good agreement
with the theoretical magnitude 1.30 cm3·K·mol–1 for uncompensated spins of three Cu2+ ions.

In addition, we determined the molecular and crystal structures
of pentanuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] and binuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me] complexes.
The small amounts of these crystals were obtained as admixtures when
synthesized with Cu(hfac)2/L2-Me ratios exceeding 1:1. A pentanuclear molecule of the [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] complex is a linear oligomer, where four bidentate nitroxide ligands
bind five Cu(hfac)2 units via the NPy and ONO atoms of the nitroxide ligands (Figure 1c). The vertices of the elongated octahedra
of the {CuO6} coordination units are occupied by ONO atoms (Cucent–ONO = 2.522(4)
Å; Table 2S). The axial positions
of the {CuO4N2} square bipyramids are occupied
by NPy donor atoms from two different ligands (Cu–NPy = 2.422(4) and 2.665(5) Å). The terminal {CuO5} square pyramids contain ONO atoms in the equatorial
plane (Cuter–ONO = 1.947(2) Å).
The molecular structure of the [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me] complex consists
of two Cu(hfac)2 fragments connected by bridging L2-Me ligand (Figure 1d and Table 2S). The vertices of the {CuO4N} square pyramid are occupied
by the NPy atoms (Cu–NPy = 2.298(3) Å).
The {CuO6} square bipyramid contains ONO atoms
and aqua ligand in the axial positions (Cu–ONO =
2.461(3) Å and Cu–OH2O = 2.344(3)
Å). The shortest ONO···ONO contacts between uncoordinated NO groups of neighboring molecules
for both [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] and [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me] are quite long and
are equal to 3.711(4) and 3.654(5) Å, respectively (Table 2S).

The main product in the {Cu(hfac)2 + L2-Br} synthetic system
is a one-dimensional [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n complex (Figure 3a). Nitroxide molecules carry out the bidentate
bridging function
via the ONO donor atoms of both NO groups in the coordination
sphere of Cu atoms. The resulting polymer chains consist of two types
of alternating [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br] monomers, which slightly differ in bond lengths and angles
(Table 3S). The vertices of {CuO6} bipyramids are occupied by ONO atoms of NO groups (Cu–ONO = 2.554(3) and 2.619(2) Å), whereas the O atoms of
the hfac anions are in the equatorial planes (Cu–Ohfac = 1.92–1.93 Å). The experimental χMT value for the [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n polymer chain
is 0.87 cm3·K·mol–1 at 300
K, which is close to the theoretical value of 0.81 cm3·K·mol–1 for two independent paramagnetic centers with S = 1/2. The χMT value
gradually increases to 2.74 cm3·K·mol–1 upon lowering the temperature to 2 K, indicating weak ferromagnetic
exchange interactions (Figure 4a) that are typical for complexes with axial coordination
of NO groups.1,2,10,13−15,18,24 The experimental dependence of
χMT(T) was approximated
using a high-temperature series expansion for the uniform chain model
(H = −JCuR∑i=1n–1SAiSAi+1)32 on the assumption that the exchange interactions JA and JB are weakly
ferromagnetic in nature and their magnitude should be approximately
the same, i.e., JCuR ≈ JA ≈ JB. The
estimated optimum parameters of magnetic exchange interactions, gR = 2.00 (fixed), gCu2+ = 2.09, JCuR = +6.8 cm–1, are in good agreement with the proposed scheme of
the intrachain exchange interactions.

Figure 3 Structures of (a) [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n, (b) [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·[Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2],
and (c) [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·2[Cu(hfac)2H2O] (H atoms,
geminal CH3 groups of
L2-Br, and CF3 groups of
hfac ligands are omitted for clarity).

dependence of χMT(T) for the [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n complex (■); the red
solid thick line represents the data calculated based on optimized
parameters.

The reaction of Cu(hfac)2 with L2-Br can often give products
containing coordinated water molecules.
Violet needle-shaped crystals of the [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·[Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] complex were obtained from a 1:1 ratio
of Cu(hfac)2 and L2-Br.
XRD revealed that their crystal structure is a cocrystal of [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2] and [Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] complexes (Figure 3b and Table 3S). The vertices of the square bipyramid of the Cu atom in
the [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2] fragment are occupied by two ONO atoms (Cu–ONO = 2.582(3) Å), whereas Ohfac atoms are located
in the equatorial plane (Cu–Ohfac = 1.92–1.93
Å). O atoms of the aqua ligands are located in the axial positions
of a distorted octahedral [Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] fragment (Cu–OH2O = 2.413(2)
Å). The distances between OH2O atoms of
the [Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] molecules and
uncoordinated NO groups and N atom of the pyridine ring from the [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2] complex
fragment are short (2.898(4) and 2.954(5) Å, respectively). This
indicates the presence of weak O–H···ONO and O–H···NPy hydrogen bonds, which
connect these [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2] and [Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] fragments into layers (Figure 3b).

After increasing the ratio of Cu(hfac)2 and L2-Br to 3:2, a small
amount of the [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·2[Cu(hfac)2H2O] compound
was precipitated (Figure 3c). The molecular structure
of [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2] complex is similar to that described above. There are ONO atoms in the axial positions of the {CuO6} units
(Cu–ONO = 2.651(9) Å). OH2O atoms occupy the vertices of {CuO5} square pyramids of
the [Cu(hfac)2H2O] fragments (Cu–OH2O = 2.250(8) Å). Each [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2] fragment is connected
with two [Cu(hfac)2H2O] via hydrogen bonds (OH2O···ONO = 2.841(10)
Å), whereas other hydrogen bonds (OH2O···NPy = 2.897(12) Å) are linked resulting in linear [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·2[Cu(hfac)2H2O] chains forming ribbons (Figure 3c and Table 3S).

The reactions of Cu(hfac)2 with nitroxides bearing
substituents
at the 5th position of the pyridine ring produce the cyclic dimer
complexes [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2 and [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2 with similar molecular structures and crystal
packing. These dimer molecules consist of two Cu(hfac)2 fragments bridged by two nitroxide molecules via NPy and
ONO donor atoms (Figures 5a and 4Sa). The coordination
sphere of both crystallographically identical Cu atoms includes the
ONO and NPy atoms from two paramagnetic ligands
and two hfac anions in cis positions. The vertices
of a square bipyramid are occupied by two Ohfac atoms (Cu–Ohfac = 2.358(3) and 2.368(3) Å). The remaining Ohfac atoms, the ONO atom, and NPy atom are located
in the equatorial plane (Table 4S).

Figure 5 Structures
of (a) [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, (b) [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n, and (c) [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2]
(H atoms, geminal CH3 groups of LR, and CF3 groups of hfac ligands are omitted for clarity).

The temperature dependence of the molar magnetic
susceptibility
shows a similar magnetic behavior for both [Cu(hfac)2L5-R]2 (R = Me, Br) complexes
(Figures 6a and 4Sc). At 300 K, χMT values are equal to 0.04 and 0.06 cm3·K·mol–1 for [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2 and [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, respectively, much smaller than the theoretical
spin value (1.62 cm3·K·mol–1) for four independent paramagnetic centers with spins S = 1/2. By lowering the temperature to 2 K, the χMT decreases to 0.01 cm3·K·mol–1 for both complexes. The strong suppression of paramagnetic
properties correlates well with the short Cu–ONO distances in the molecular structure of [Cu(hfac)2L5-R]2 (R = Me, Br) dimers. The
equatorial coordination of the nitroxide group to the central Cu2+ ion should lead to direct overlapping of their magnetic
orbitals and mutual compensation of the spins in the {Cu–O•–N<} exchange clusters.1,2,14,15,21,24 The χMT(T) dependences are well described
by the dimer model with the Hamiltonian H = −2JCuR(SCuSR) using the PHI program.31 The optimum values of the exchange parameters are as follows: gR = 2.00 (fixed), gCu2+ = 2.15, JCuR= −493 cm–1, zJ′
= −0.10 cm–1 for [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, and gR = 2.00 (fixed), gCu2+ = 2.00, JCuR= -544 cm–1, zJ′ = −0.11
cm–1 for [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2. The residual χMT value is 0.01 cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K for both the dimers, attributed to the free spin defects
being less than 0.6%.

Figure 6 Experimental dependences of χMT(T) for (a) [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2 and (b) [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n; red solid thick lines represent
the data calculated based on optimized parameters.

Dark-red crystals of the [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 dimer complex were isolated
in the synthesis
containing equimolar amounts of Cu(hfac)2 and L6-Me. The [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 complex shows the same molecular structure with
short Cu–NPy and Cu–ONO bond lengths
(Cu–ONO ∼1.97 Å and Cu–NPy ∼2.04 Å; Figure 4Sb and Table 4S) as the above-mentioned Cu(II) compounds with nitroxide
derivatives containing Me and Br substituents in the 5th position
of the pyridine ring. The mutual arrangement of [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 dimer molecules
is different from that in the crystal structure complexes with 5-Me-
and 5-Br-substituted nitroxides. However, the magnetic behavior, mainly
caused by intramolecular magnetic exchange interactions, is similar
to the above-described one for [Cu(hfac)2L5-R]2 (R = Me, Br). The optimum values of the fitted
exchange parameters gR = 2.15 (fixed), gCu2+ = 2.15, JCuR= −460 cm–1, zJ′ = −0.10 cm–1 (H = -2JCuR(SCuSR)) show totally suppressed
paramagnetism due to strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions
between spins in the {Cu–O•–N<}
exchange clusters (Figure 4Sd).

The
molecular structures of the obtained [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 cyclic dimers
and the previously described [Cu(hfac)2L4-Me]212 complex are similar. [Cu(hfac)2L4-Me]2 undergoes
ferromagnetic exchange interactions in the temperature range 2–300
K,12 whereas [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, and [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 exhibit
suppressed paramagnetism that strongly correlates with the axial and
equatorial type of the NO group bonding to the Cu2+ central
ion. As the increasing of intermolecular Cu–ONO distances,
associating with the change-over of spin multiplicity, can be initiated
by increasing the temperature,12 we performed
the differential thermal and thermogravimetric analysis of the obtained
dimer complexes. However, the TG-DTA curves for [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, and [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 (Figure 5S) did not show any specific heat effects
associated with phase transitions up to the samples’ decomposition
temperature. Thus, the strongly coupled state is the most stable one
for the [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, and [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 dimer complexes in the temperature range 2–380
K.

The reaction of Cu(hfac)2 with the 6-Br-substituted
derivative of nitronyl nitroxide yielded the one-dimensional [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n and trinuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2] complexes (Figure 5b,c and Table 4S). The trinuclear molecule of the [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2]
complex is a linear oligomer, where two nitroxide ligands bind with
three Cu(hfac)2 via ONO atoms. The vertices
of the square bipyramid of the central Cucent atom in the
{CuO6} coordination unit are occupied by the ONO atoms (Cucent–ONO = 2.577(2) Å).
The coordination sphere of the Cuter atom of the terminal
{CuO5} square pyramids contains an ONO atom
in the equatorial plane (Cuter–ONO =
1.953(2) Å).

The structure of the [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n polymer chain complex results
from the bridging bidentate coordination of L6-Br (Figure 5b).
Each Cu atom is surrounded either by two ONO atoms or by
two NPy atoms from two different L6-Br, leading to a head-to-head motif of infinite chains. Both
donor atoms of the ligands occupy the axial positions in the alternating
{CuO6} and {CuO4N2} square bipyramids
(Cu–ONO = 2.385(3) Å and Cu–NPy = 2.955(3) Å), whereas the equatorial planes are formed by
the Ohfac atoms of the hfac anions (Table 4S). The shortest distances between ONO atoms
from uncoordinated nitroxide groups of the ligands from neighboring
chains are more than 4 Å.

The χMT for [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n is 0.80 cm3·K·mol–1 at 300
K, in good agreement with the theoretical value (0.81 cm3·K·mol–1) for two independent spins S = 1/2 of Cu2+ ion and nitroxide radical per
formula fragment [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br] (Figure 6b).
χMT gradually increases with decreasing
temperature and reaches 1.68 cm3·K·mol–1 at 2 K, indicating the domination of ferromagnetic exchange interactions,
which are typical for axial coordination of NO groups to central Cu2+ ions.1,2,10,14,24 The experimental
dependence of χMT(T) is well described by the model including the contribution of the
three-spin {RA-JCuR-Cu2+A-JCuR-RB} exchange cluster (H = −2JCuR(SCuASRA + SRBSCuA)) and isolated Cu2+ ion spins from coordination units {CuO4N2}
according to the Curie law, with the best fit parameters as follows: gR = 2.00 (fixed), gCu2+ = 2.10, JCuR = +16 cm–1, and zJ′ = +0.07 cm–1.

General Comparisons
Comparing data of the Cu(hfac)2 complexes with substituted derivatives of 3-pyridyl nitronyl
nitroxides obtained within the scope of the current study and previously
described elsewhere4,12,26 showed that the substituent type and its position in the pyridine
heterocycle considerably affect the structure and magnetic behavior
of the resulting compounds. Initially, we suspected that a substituent
at the 2nd position of the pyridine ring should sterically hinder
the coordination of both imine and nitroxide donor sites. Occupation
of the 4th or 6th positions should mainly weaken the donor properties
of only the nitroxide or the imine, respectively. The location of
the substituent at the 5th position of the pyridine heterocycle should
have a much smaller effect on donor abilities of a ligand. Additionally,
we assumed that Br substituent should considerably weaken the nearest
donor site due to a strong negative inductive effect. However, the
ability of ligand donor sites to allow coordination is only one of
the factors affecting the molecular structures of complexes. The spatial
arrangements of hfac and nitroxide ligands in different types of coordination
units and the number of coordinated donor sites of ligands are strongly
influenced by the reagents ratio, their concentration, the solvent
used, ambient temperature, and humidity.1,2,7,11,23,24 The low solubility of the resulting
solids and the strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between
paramagnetic centers can result in some particular molecular and high-dimensional
species.1,2,23,24

The angle between the planes of the nitronyl
nitroxide O•–N–C=N→O
fragment and the pyridine ring is one of the key indicators of steric
hindrance for 3-pyridyl-substituted nitronyl nitroxides (Scheme 2 and Table 5S). It is 36 and 53° for crystallographically
independent molecules in the crystal structure of L,4 showing a broad range of possible conformations of the
substituted derivatives. The smallest values of the CN2–Py angle (10–19°) were found for nitroxides with
the Me group or Br atom at the 5th position of the pyridine ring.
This angle increases to ∼37° when the Br atom is shifted
to the 6th position of the pyridine heterocycle. The largest values
were found for L2-R and L4-Me 12 derivatives
(47–72°), which are in perfect agreement with the expected
increased steric hindrance.

Scheme 2 Angle between the Planes of the Nitronyl
Nitroxide O•–N–C=N→O
Fragment and the Pyridine Ring
A similar correlation between the CN2–Py interplanar
angle and the arrangement of substituents in LR (R = Me, Br) is found for the molecular structures of the complexes
(Table 6S). However, this relationship
is much more complicated and required consideration of the steric
properties of bulky Cu(hfac)2 fragments in the different
types of coordination units and the variation of a number of coordinated
donor sites of ligands. Notably, the most sterically hindered L2-R and L4-Me 12 radicals produce the largest
number of complexes, whereas the use of ligands bearing substituents
at the 5th and 6th positions of the pyridine heterocycle produces
only one main coordination complex for each paramagnetic ligand. Apparently,
a high steric hindrance for complexes with L2-R and L4-Me derivatives induces
the formation of many conformers with various CN2–Py
angles in a solution, leading to the precipitation of compounds with
different molecular structures.

The comparison of distances
between Cu atoms and imine and nitroxide
donor sites allowed us to clarify the key correlations between the
type and position of the substituent in the pyridine heterocycle and
the coordinating ability of nitroxide ligands (Table 6S). The short Cu–NPy (∼2.00
Å) and Cu–ONO (∼1.97 Å) distances
have been found for dimer complexes containing ligands bearing Me
and Br substituents at the 5th position of the pyridine ring. Similar
cyclic dimers were obtained for Cu(hfac)2 complexes with
L4-Me and L6-Me ligands. Shift of the Me group to the 6th position of the
pyridine ring does not considerably change the donor ability of the
imine site and Cu–NPy distance (∼2.04 Å).
In contrast, the nitroxide donor site for L4-Me is more sterically hindered, which results in lengthening
of the Cu–ONO bond (∼2.43 Å).12

The complexes with L6-Br ligand
are the one-dimensional polymer [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n and the trinuclear molecule
[{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2]. These are completely different from the [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 cyclic dimer
based on a Me-substituted analogue. The replacement of the Me group
by a Br atom at the 6th position of the pyridine heterocycle substantially
weakens the imine donor site due to a strong negative inductive effect,
as indicated by the Cu–NPy bond lengths in the resulting
complexes. Chains with a head-to-head motif of [Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n are similar to the previously described coordination polymers for
complexes based on pyrazolyl-substituted derivatives of nitroxides.9,10,23,24 Alternating octahedral {CuO6} and {CuO4N2} coordination units contain chelate hfac ligands in a coplanar
arrangement. This arrangement should be less spatially crowded compared
with the cis position spacing in {CuO5N} units for the [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 dimer complex. Both NPy and ONO atoms are situated in axial positions of elongated octahedra
(Cu–NPy = 2.954(3) Å and Cu–ONO = 2.385(2) Å). The structure of [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2] is similar
to the previously described [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-OMe)2].26 The weak donor ability of the imine site leads to the absence
of coordination to the central Cu2+ ion in both trinuclear
complexes with L6-Br and L6-OMe. The negative inductive effect inherent
in L6-Br is comparable to the steric
hindrance of L6-OMe. The pentacoordinated
terminal {CuO5} units have reduced spatial bulkiness and
provide shorter Cu–ONO (1.953(2) Å) distances
than those in the central {CuO6} coordination unit (2.577(2)
Å).

The introduction of substituents at the 2nd position
of the pyridine
heterocycle sterically hinders both imine and nitroxide donor sites
of the L2-R ligand. Nevertheless, it
turned out to be favorable for the formation of various conformers
of L2-R and complexes with different
molecular structures. This is similar to some other stereochemically
flexible Cu(II)–nitroxide systems, where a reaction of Cu(hfac)2 with polyfunctional nitroxides yields various solids with
different structures and compositions.1,2,7,9−14,23,24 At the same time, a variety of structural motifs generates the diversity
of magnetic properties.1,2,10,11,23,24 The short Cu–NPy bonds (2.003(9)
and 2.021(8) Å) were observed only for the mononuclear [Cu(hfac)2L2-Me] complex due to the reduced
spatial bulkiness of pentacoordinated {CuO4N} units. For
the [{Cu(hfac)2}2(H2O)L2-Me] complex with two Cu(hfac)2 fragments,
which coordinate the same L2-Me ligand,
the Cu–NPy bond in the {CuO4N} units
becomes longer (2.298(3) Å), whereas the coordination sphere
of the other Cu atom tends to a distorted octahedral environment {CuO6} by including an ONO atom and H2O molecule
in axial positions (Cu–ONO = 2.461(3) Å and
Cu–OH2O = 2.344(3) Å).

The
reproducibly obtained [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] complex is supposedly
the most thermodynamically stable product in the {Cu(hfac)2 + L2-Me} system. In spite of steric
hindrance, both L2-Me ligands can perform
tridentate coordination. As expected, Cu–ONO distances
in central {CuO6} square bipyramids are long (2.481(2)
Å). Long Cu–NPy (2.302(2) Å) and short
Cu–ONO (1.953(2) Å) bonds in pentacoordinated
{CuO4N} and {CuO5} units, respectively, indicate
the higher steric effect on the imine donor site, comparable with
nitroxide. Similar bond lengths for the L2-Me ligand donor sites are found for the linear pentanuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] complex (Cu–NPy = 2.422(4) and 2.665(5) Å,
Cucent–ONO = 2.522(4) Å, and Cuter–ONO = 1.947(2) Å). Linear trinuclear
complexes are often obtained using an excess of Cu(hfac)2 in the reaction mixture.15,24 Recently, another linear
pentanuclear complex with a different arrangement of coordination
units was reported.10 Reducing the spatial
bulkiness of [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] complexes via formation
of terminal pentacoordinated {CuO5} or {CuO4N} units prevents the assembly of high-dimensional species. However,
the precipitation of intermediate oligomers in the form of new pentanuclear
[{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] complexes could clarify
the mechanism for obtaining various polymers with chain, layered,
or framework structures.

Location of the Br atom at the 2nd
position of the pyridine heterocycle
leads to considerable weakening of the imine site of L2-Br because of both the increasing steric hindrance and the negative
inductive effect. Therefore, coordination of an imine atom to a Cu2+ ion is absent for the molecular structure in the [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n, [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·[Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2], and [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2]·2[Cu(hfac)2H2O] complexes.
The chain polymer structure of [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n consists of alternating nitroxide
and Cu(hfac)2 fragments, with long Cu–ONO distances (2.554(2) and 2.619(2) Å) in distorted octahedral
{CuO6} units. Despite the possibility of the existence
of trinuclear oligomers like [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2], the molecular structures
of the other two complexes includes mononuclear [Cu(hfac)2(L2-Br)2] molecules, which
are bound by weak hydrogen bonds with [Cu(hfac)2(H2O)2] or [Cu(hfac)2H2O] fragments
containing coordinated water molecules.

The magnetic properties
of complexes correlate with their structural
characteristics. The character of the magnetic exchange interactions
for cyclic dimers with {CuO4N} coordination units mainly
depends on the steric properties of the ligand. The strong antiferromagnetic
coupling between spins of Cu2+ ions and nitronyl nitroxides
is observed for the [Cu(hfac)2L5-Me]2, [Cu(hfac)2L5-Br]2, and [Cu(hfac)2L6-Me]2 dimers with short Cu–ONO bonds
due to a weak steric effect. Ferromagnetic exchange interactions in
the two-spin-coupled {Cu2+–O•–N<}
exchange clusters for [Cu(hfac)2L4-Me]2 12 results
from lengthening of the Cu–ONO bonds due to steric
hindrance of the nitroxide donor site of L4-Me. The appearance of {CuO5} coordination units with
short Cu–ONO in complexes based on L2-R and L6-Br ligands provides
strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. This leads to full
compensation of spins of Cu2+ ions and coordinated nitronyl
nitroxides already at room temperature, as was found for [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2]. Coordination of a nitroxide group to the axial position of elongated
{CuO6} octahedra is favorable for the formation of exchange
channels with ferromagnetic interactions between spins of Cu2+ ions and nitroxides, as takes place for [Cu(hfac)2L2-Br]n and
[Cu(hfac)2L6-Br]n species.

Conclusions
Tuning
of the donor ability of nitroxide coordination sites is
a powerful tool for the formation of Cu(II) complexes with diverse
molecular and crystal structures and therefore various magnetic behaviors.
Introduction of a methyl group or bromine atom at different positions
of the pyridine heterocycle affects the donor abilities of the nitroxide
ligand due to steric or/and electronic effects of substituents. Complexes
in which substituents do not strongly reduce the coordination ability
of ligands (L5-Me, L5-Br, L6-Me) exhibit strong antiferromagnetic
exchange interactions in two-spin-coupled {Cu2+–O•–N<} clusters when NO groups are equatorially
coordinated in {CuO4N} units. The arrangement of long Cu–ONO bonds in {CuO6} square bipyramids due to the
weakening of the nitroxide donor site in complexes with L2-Me, L2-Br, and
L6-Br leads to ferromagnetic exchange
interactions between spins of Cu2+ ions and nitroxides.
However, the design of complexes with predictable structures and magnetic
behaviors should consider other steric factors, such as the bulkiness
of hfac and nitroxide ligands in different types of coordination units
and the number of coordinated donor sites of ligands. Spontaneously
reducing steric hindrance due to formation of pentacoordinated {CuO5} units with short Cu–ONO distances allows
the assembly of low-dimensional species with strong antiferromagnetic
exchange interactions in two-spin-coupled {Cu2+–O•–N<} clusters.

The high steric hindrance
for L2-R ligands can lead to various
conformers in solution, which provides
additional diversity of molecular structures of the resulting complexes.
This allows pentanuclear [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4]
complexes to be obtained with unique molecular structures. The [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] oligomers are suggested to be intermediate species
in the formation of various chain polymers, as well as layered and
framework complexes. We have plans for further investigations on the
effect of bulky substituents in the pyridine heterocycle of nitroxide
on the structure and magnetic properties of complexes. This will create
additional opportunities in the design of complexes with novel molecular
structures and desired magnetic properties.

crystals of [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)2] and [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] compounds are difficult
to distinguish because they are similar in both color and habit. We
could not collect enough [{Cu(hfac)2}5(L2-Me)4] manually with SC XRD

The crystals of [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2] complex were obtained
as an admixture by quickly decreasing the volume of the reaction mixture
with a flow of nitrogen. Because of the small size of [{Cu(hfac)2}3(L6-Br)2] crystals, we collected only several of them manually for SC XRD
study.

X-ray Crystallography (XRD)
X-ray diffraction intensities
were collected for the selected single crystals individually mounted
on glass fibers using Bruker diffractometers—SMART-APEX II
with a CCD and D8-QUEST with a CMOS area detector (Mo Kα radiation).
Data reduction was performed using SAINT, and intensities were corrected
for absorption by using SADABS.36,37 The structures were
solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares
procedure anisotropically for nonhydrogen atoms. The H atoms were
calculated geometrically and included in the refinement as riding
groups. All calculations were fulfilled with the program package SHELXT
2014/5 and SHELXT-2018/3.38 The crystallographic

were performed using an MPMS-5 SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design)
in the temperature range 2–350 K in a 5 kOe magnetic field.
The molar magnetic susceptibility was calculated using diamagnetic
corrections for the complexes according to the Pascal scheme.39 Analysis and fitting of magnetochemistry data
for heterospin complexes was performed with the PHI program.31
