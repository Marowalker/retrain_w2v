In this article, the trajectories
of S-deoxyephedrine
(SBD) along molecular channels within the complex protein structure
of third dopamine receptor (D3R) are analyzed via molecular
dynamic techniques, including potential mean force calculations of
umbrella samplings from the 4.5 version of the GROMACS program. Changes
in free energy due to the movement of SBD within D3R are
determined, and the molecular dynamic mechanisms of SBD transmitting
along molecular channels are probed. Molecular simulated results show
that the change in free energy is calculated as 171.7 kJ·mol–1 for the transmission of SBD toward the outside of
the cell along the y+ axis functional molecular channel
and is 275.0 kJ·mol–1 for movement toward the
intracellular structure along the y– axis.
Within the internal structure of D3R, the changes in free
energy are determined to be 103.6, 242.1, 459.7, and 127.8 kJ·mol–1 for transmission of SBD along the x+, x–, z+, and z– axes, respectively, toward the cell bilayer membrane, which
indicates that SBD leaves much more easily along the x+ axis through the gap between the TM5 (the fifth transmembrane helix)
and TM6 (the sixth transmembrane helix) from the internal structure
of D3R. The values of free-energy changes indicate that
SBD molecules can clear the protective channel within D3R, which helps dopamine molecules to leave the D3R internal
structure along the x+ axis and to prevent them for
exerting excessive neurotransmitter function. Therefore, our results
suggest that SBD is effective for development as a drug for treating
schizophrenia and its pharmacology is closely related to its dynamics
and mechanisms within the molecular pathway of dopamine receptors.

Introduction
Schizophrenia is a serious mental disease
with a 0.5% incidence
rate of the total population (in world) and is characterized by changes
in basic personality, thinking, emotion, behavior, and disharmony
between mental activity and the environment.1 The disease does not only affect mental health but early death frequently
occurs in diseased patients in 12–15 years compared with the
average person.2 Thus, schizophrenia results
in more loss of lives than that caused by most cancers and physical
illnesses.2 Although the precise societal
burden of schizophrenia is hardly known despite the wide diversity
of accumulated data and employed methods, cost-of-illness data uniformly
point to disquieting human and financial costs.3

At present, there exist three hypotheses (theories)
that physicochemically
explain schizophrenia, namely, the dopaminergic hypothesis, glutamate
hypothesis, and 5-hydroxy tryptamine hypothesis.4 These three kinds of hypotheses ultimately lead to dopamine
hyperfunction, in which dopamine molecules excessively overact with
the neurotransmitter function. Therefore, all current clinical medical
treatments for schizophrenia work by blocking dopamine molecules overly
to play a neurotransmitter function. Dopamine (DA) is an important
neurotransmitter in the brain that aids the regulation of motor functions,
cognitive activity, drug addiction, and other physiological and pathological
processes through the expression of dopamine receptors in the central
nervous system.4,5 There are five subtypes of dopamine
receptor membrane proteins in the central nervous system (CNS), all
of which are G protein coupled receptors and composed of seven transmembrane
(TM) domains (7-GM). Studies on dopamine receptors began in the late
1970s, when the existence of D1, D2, two classes of dopamine subtype
receptors was first confirmed.6 In the
early 1990s, with the development of biological cloning technology,
five subtypes of dopamine receptor molecules were cloned: D2R, D3R, and D4R belonging to the D2-like receptor
group and D1R and D5R to the D1 group.7−11

Considering the diversity of dopamine receptor subtypes, the
specificity
of their distribution within brain regions, and their functional differences
in the synaptic environment, the DA system in the brain is highly
complex. Treatments for schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease
(PD) as well as those for drug addiction are all closely related to
the complex DA system.12−18 Many findings from studies on these mental diseases have been achieved
that have paved the way for more in-depth studies. For example, Arvid
Carlson, Paul Greengard, and Eric Kandel won the 2000 Nobel Prize
in medicine after discovering that dopamine molecules act as a signal
transduction and in the regulation of motor function, cognitive activity,
drug addiction, and other physiological and pathological processes.12 In 2010, the only crystal protein structure
of the dopamine third receptor (D3R) was reported after
problems with membrane protein stability and crystallization had been
overcome.19 In a previous study, we had
obtained the D3R complex protein structure based on the
crystal structure to furthermore study the interaction between D3R and dopamine and analyze how DA affects neurotransmitter
function within the D3R spatial structure, which is considered
to be surrounded by seven transmembrane helices.20,21 On the basis of this complex protein, we had studied the molecular
dynamics of DA moving along several directions within D3R and obtained the trajectory of DA moving within D3R,
as shown in Figure 1.22

Figure 1 Molecular channels for dopamine to transmit
from the space among
cell gaps arriving inside the space region of D3R to play
a function of neurotransmitter and then leaving from the internal
structure to keep a normal physiological balance of dopamine.

In Figure 1, the
transmembrane helix region of the receptor protein can form a functional
space but it also constitutes a molecular pathway for the transport
of dopamine molecules to move within the seven transmembrane helices.
Molecular channels are divided into two categories, namely: (1) a
functional molecular channel for transferring molecules to play an
important role of function as neurotransmitter; and (2) a protective
molecular channel to prevent excess molecular function from molecular
damage and to play a role in body mental protection.4,15,22 Considering the role of these
channels, it is reasonable to concur that all current pharmacological
treatments for schizophrenia work by blocking dopamine receptors by
means of blocking these functional molecular channels.23 Furthermore, schizophrenia may also occur if
the free energy needed by DA to move along a protective channel increases
or as a result of a protective channel blocked by the receptor protein
conformational variation.22 Therefore,
it is essential to maintain the smoothness of the DA protective channel
to avoid dopamine hyperfunction or to prevent DA from excessive function
as a neurotransmitter, which is a plausible new method for controlling
and treating schizophrenia.

Because it is known that S-deoxyephedrine (SBD)
acts on dopamine receptors in the CNS cells, it may also play a functional
role by passing through the functional channel of a dopamine receptor
or may prevent excessive molecular function by transmitting through
the protective channel. In this article, we studied the trajectories
and movement of SBD along the channels within D3R and changes
in free energy along the trajectories to investigate the kinetics
and mechanism of SBD and its CNS pharmacological effects within dopamine
receptors. Our results show SBD to have a very unique character preferably
moving through a protective channel unlike some molecules preferably
moving through the functional channel.24,25 SBD moves
along the functional molecular channel within D3R toward
the outside of the cell, with a free-energy change of 171.7 kJ·mol–1, whereas movement toward intracellular orientation
induces a free-energy change of 275 kJ·mol–1. Furthermore, SBD trajectories along the protective molecular channels
within D3R in the x+, x–, z+, and z– axes
toward spaces in the cellular membrane result in free-energy changes
of 103.6, 242.1, 459.7, and 127.8 kJ·mol–1 respectively.
In this article, the results suggest that SBD is more likely to leave
the internal structure of D3R between TM5 and TM6 along
the protective channels.

Results and Discussion
Research Systems of D3R with SBD
Like some
molecules reported in our previous articles,22,24,25 SBD is not a large molecule because large
molecules are not accessible within dopamine molecular channels. In
addition, SBD is a molecular state because the charged residues along
the molecular channels have a very strong interaction with the ion
state of molecules. If molecules are the ion states, they cannot move
along the channels. On the basis of the D3R–DA complex
protein structure, using dopamine as a pointer molecule, the SBD molecule
is docked into D3R to form the SBD–D3R complex protein, which is performed for 20 ns of molecular dynamics
simulation, whose results are shown in Figure 2 (right). Because the D3R protein
structure originates from the crystal structural data, for modifying
the crystal protein structure, 20 ns of MD simulation may be available.
In 2011,20 we had demonstrated that the
300 ns MD simulation of D3R protein structure is not better
than it for 20 ns of MD simulation to modify the crystal protein structure
of D3R by comparing the binding free energy between the
dopamine molecule and D3R protein. Generally, it is known
that the crystal protein structure without MD modification of simulation
does have structural problems but if the MD simulation modification
time is too long, it will create new problems; at the same time, it
will make the protein structure lose a lot of important protein crystal
data. Therefore, the basic characteristics of the binding free energy
between SBD and D3R protein should be maintained for both the 20 ns
simulated protein and the protein in the nature. SBD is a chiral molecule
with S chiral configuration, whose molecular structure is also shown
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 also
shows
that SBD and ETQ (eticlopride) have similar binding sites within D3R. In a previous study, we determined the active site residues
via quantum chemical calculations.20 In
the D3R structure, the seven residues that act as active
sites for SBD include Asp75, Asp110, Cys114, Trp342, Phe346, Gly372,
and Tyr373. The remaining six residues except Asp75 are located about
6 Å around the ETQ molecule (Table 1), whereas similar various amino acids act
as the active sites for SBD and ETQ. However, the SBD molecule is
located in the inner cavity of D3R. ETQ is an antischizophrenia
drug whose active cavity is located within D3R, as shown
in Figure 2.19 This target of the cavity also should be the
active site of SBD for binding to D3R.

Figure 3 displays
the system structure, which contains a total of 23 484 atoms.
In addition to D3R and SBD, there are 84 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(POPC) phospholipid molecules, 5438 water molecules, and 8 Cl– ions that neutralize the positive charge of the system.

with SBD, including the double-layer phospholipid POPC-H2O membrane; (right panel) the figure of root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) vs 20 ns MD simulation for the total system, D3R
and SBD.

Figure 3 (right
panel) shows the plot of RMSD versus 20 ns MD simulation for the D3R complex system, with SBD within the double-layer POPC-H2O membrane, D3R, and SBD. The values of RMSD demonstrate
that after 2.5 ns of MD simulation, the D3R–SBD
system reached stable equilibrium with background values of ±0.01
nm located at 4.11 nm, ±0.01 nm located at 0.29 nm for D3R, and ±0.01 nm located at 0.14 nm for SBD. On the basis
of the molecular dynamics simulation, these results show that the
system achieved a balanced equilibrium and can be used as the initial
structure to study the trajectories of SBD moving within D3R.

Trajectory and Free-Energy Potential Surface of SBD Moving along
the Functional Molecular Channel within D3R
On
the basis of the D3R–SBD complex optimized structure
obtained by molecular dynamics simulation, we study six trajectories
of SBD moving within D3R (Figure 4). The direction of the y+ axis is defined as the direction of SBD moving from the internal
to external structure of D3R, and the y– axis refers to the movement of SBD from the internal to
intracellular structure of D3R. The directions along the x+, x–, z+, and z– axes are the directions of SBD moving from D3R into the middle of the cell membrane. The most probable
direction of SBD movement into the cellular membrane space can be
determined by taking these four directions into consideration.

Figure 4 (Left below
panel): Six orientations for SBD to move within D3R, and
the tracks to move toward the outside of the cell supposed
to be along the y+ axis and toward the inside of
the cell along the y– axis, along the x+, x–, z+, and z– axes for SBD from the interior of D3R to move into the POPC phospholipid bilayer membrane; up panels:
four pictures of the tracks along the y+ axis for
SBD to move from point o, passing a and b, and arriving at point c; (right below panel): the potential of the mean force (PMF) of the
track along the y+ axis for SBD to move.

In the y+ axis direction, Leu95
is selected as
the reference group because it is near the SBD molecule in the reverse
direction of motion. Because there is a relatively large space for
the movement of water molecules and phospholipids in the system, such
substances are not suitable to be used as the reference group. A maximum
external force is set to 2000 kJ·mol–1, which
forces SBD to move along the y+ axis direction and
permeate out of the cell. However, in the actual process, procedures
are based on a system that will provide a suitable external force
of less than 2000 kJ·mol–1, prompting SBD to
move and generate the trajectories of the coordinates. Figure 4 shows the structural figures
of SBD’s four-point systems on the trajectory, where o point is the starting point system. After the a and b point systems reach the c point trajectory system, the SBD molecule moves out of
D3R through a molecular pathway.

Along the y+ axis direction, from the SBD trajectory
coordinate file, 50 samples are selected to simulate rebalance of
the sample system; these samples are listed in Table 2. In the SBD trajectory file, data of 1001
points are to be preserved in different directions but are not necessary
to use to simulate the umbrella samples. The 1001 trajectory points
of the conformational data correspond to the length of 1000 ps molecular
simulation, in which every 1 ps extracts a point of trajectory conformation
data. Therefore, the sample number corresponds to the length of the
trajectory simulation (ps unit). Using trajectory point system conformation
data, centroid distances between the reference and motion groups can
be calculated in different numbers of samples. According to the center
distance of mass between SBD and the reference system, the selection
of samples increases by about 0.05 nm. In different regions, because
of the change of a given force, SBD displays rotational motion in
addition to translational motion, resulting in a large change in the
distance between the reference and moving groups, even if the centroid
distance variations in adjacent umbrella samples are greater than
0.05 nm. During molecular motion, the reference frame of the system
and centroid position of the moving group both change, restricting
the actual distance in accordance with the 0.05 nm integer times;
or in other words, the sample interval is not fully consistent with
the 0.05 nm interval. For the selected 50 samples, the centroid distance
between the motion and reference groups is respectively fixed; then,
after 800 ps of molecular dynamic simulation, the SBD molecule and
whole system are rebalanced, which are characterized using RMSD values.
The results of this study are similar to those of previous studies,
which also reported that the RMSD values of each sample system were
maintained between ±0.02 and the ground value from 600 to 800
ps to show the achievement of a balanced sample system after 400 000
steps of molecular dynamics simulation (the data is not given in this
article). Although the external force needs to form the trajectory
caused the system to deviate slightly from the equilibrium, this deviation
is not much different from that of the original system, meaning the
system can be quickly rebalanced.

a Umbrella sampling chosen according
to the distance of 0.05 nm between the sampling and reference groups
from the track file recorded for SBD to move along the +y axis, n: the serial number recorded in the track
file; D: the distance between the sampling and reference
groups. The reference group is Leu95.

Although many samples are selected along the two trajectories
and
the molecular dynamics simulation is used to realize the rebalance,
the simulations still belong to the biased results from the limited
samplings. Therefore, the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM)
in Gromacs 4.5 program is adopted to convert the results of biased
sampling into unbiased sampling. Then, the mean force potential (PMF)
is calculated from the results of a series of umbrella samples to
obtain the free-energy change diagram in Figure 4.

The VMD program is used to demonstrate
and analyze the trajectory
of SBD. Using the distance between the sample and reference in the
trajectory listed in Table 2 and considering the free-energy change of SBD on the trajectory
coordinates, the locations of SBD within D3R can be determined.
For the sake of simplicity, in each trajectory, only four key positions
of SBD’s image are given. Along the y+ axis
direction in Figure 4, the SBD trajectory starts at o after a point (1.38 nm) and b point (2.16 nm) to reach c point (3.49 nm) position, where it leaves out of the D3R internal structure. The figure shows that the free energy
of SBD on the trajectory is 171.7 kJ·mol–1.

In Figure 5, Ser156
is selected as the reference system and the 44 samples are listed
in Table 3. Along the y– axis direction, SBD begins at starting point o, after a point (2.47 nm) and b point (3.06 nm) to reach c (3.54 nm)
position, which basically leaves out of the internal structure of
D3R. In Figure 5, data show that the free-energy change required for SBD to
leave out of the internal structure of D3R toward the intracellular
position is 275.0 kJ·mol–1.

a The reference group is Ser156.

One reason for the difference in
free energy between the y+ and y– axes may be derived from
the initial structural conformation of the D3R crystal protein. Because the outer end of the protein is
combined with an antagonist, it creates an open protein structure.
Another reason is that the molecular channel itself is not used to
transport SBD molecules from the external environment into the cell.
SBD itself needs to permeate through the cell membrane for playing
a functional role, unlike dopamine through the synaptic transfer mainly
through the dopamine transporter to complete transport through the
cell membrane back to the inside cell, consistent with the results
observed in some experiments.26−28

Trajectory and Free Energy
Potential Surface of SBD Moving along
the Protective Molecular Channel within D3R
The
trajectory and free-energy potential surface for SBD to move within
D3R along the protective molecular channels are analyzed
through the x+, x–, z+, and z– axes. From any one of
these four directions, SBD molecules are likely to move from the internal
structure of D3R and enter the cell membrane space.

Figure 6 shows that
SBD moves along the x+ axis into the space trajectory
of the bilayer membrane, where the reference group is a Leu15 residue,
and the selected 39 sample systems are listed in Table 4. Combining the main and top
views in Figure 6,
it can be seen that SBD starts from the start point of o along the x+ axis, after a point
(1.88 nm) and b point (2.23 nm) to reach the c point (3.34 nm) position. From the slit of TM5–TM6
between the two transmembrane helices, SBD exits the internal structure
of D3R. Along the x+ axis trajectory,
the free-energy change of SBD movement in this process is determined
to be 103.6 kJ·mol–1.

Table 5 lists 35
samples of SBD selected along the x– axis,
where the reference group is a Val173 residue. Figure 7 displays the trajectory of SBD moving along
the x– axis into the cell membrane. The main
view and top views in Figure 7 both show that SBD starts from the start point of o along the x– axis direction, after a point (2.20 nm) and b point (2.78 nm)
to reach the c point (3.21 nm) position. From the
slit of TM1–TM7 between the two transmembrane helices, SBD
leaves the D3R internal structure. Along the x– axis trajectory, the free-energy change of the process is
determined to be 242.1 kJ·mol–1 for SBD movement.

Figure 8 shows that
SBD moved along the z+ axis and entered the space
trajectory of the bilayer membrane, in which the reference group is
a Val251 residue and the 50 sample systems are listed in Table 6. In the main and
top views in Figure 8, it can be seen that along the z+ axis, SBD started
at the start point of o, after a point (1.14 nm) and b point (1.69 nm), to reach
the c point (3.02 nm) position. From the slit of
TM1–TM2 between the two transmembrane helices, SBD exits the
D3R internal structure. Along the z+ axis
trajectory, the free-energy change of the process is 459.7 kJ·mol–1 for SBD movement.

When SBD moves along the molecular
channels within D3R, there is a certain degree of flexibility.
It is also determined
that within a certain range, the SBD molecules are always moving along
the direction of less energy. When a transmembrane helix is in front
of the SBD trajectory, the direction of SBD changes slightly and moves
from the transmembrane helix to the gap to exit the cell. The trajectories
along the y axis direction are farthest from the
membrane’s helix column gap and move toward the internal structure,
unless subjected to the ring structure. By studying the four directions
through x+, x–, z+, and z– axes, it should be possible to
cover the most likely trajectories of SBD movement into the space
within cell bilayer membrane. Therefore, for SBD movement along the
protective molecular channels within D3R, the most probable
trajectory of SBD is to leave the D3R internal structure
between the TM5 and TM6 gap along the x+ axis, with
a free-energy change of 103.6 kJ·mol–1.

When free dopamine molecules are located at cell synaptic clefts,
they bind with different subtypes of dopamine receptors on the posterior
membranes to initiate signal transmission and play the role of a neurotransmitter
to control functions of movement, cognition, emotion, etc. During
dopamine transport, dopamine molecules are easily combined with dopamine
receptors along the functional molecular channels to act as neurotransmitters.
The protective molecular channel provides a pathway for the dopamine
molecules to remove themselves from the receptors after functioning
as neurotransmitters. If there is no way for dopamine molecules to
leave or if the free energy of the passage for dopamine becomes larger
under certain conditions, dopamine molecules continually combine with
their receptors and maintain as neurotransmitters. To prevent this
from occurring, dopamine molecules need to move along a trajectory
of less free energy. Our previous researches show that in the D3R structure, dopamine molecules are most likely to leave out
of the D3R internal structure between the TM5 and TM6 gaps
along the x+ axis, with a free-energy change of 65.8
kJ·mol–1.22 From
this presented study, our results reveal that 103.6 kJ·mol–1 is the minimum value of free-energy change for SBD
to move along the x+ axis in the molecular channels
and exit the internal structure of D3R from the gap of
TM5–TM6 between two transmembrane helices. Before then, SBD
first permeates into the inner cells and from the inner cells moves
toward the active pocket along the reverse direction of y– axis, which is a spontaneous process with free energy of
−275 kJ·mol–1. In the structure, the
space of the gap between TM5 and TM6 between is much wider than other
gaps, which is viewed from the complex D3R protein with
SBD. It has been demonstrated that it is easier for SBD to leave the
D3R interior from the TM5 and TM6 gap along the protective
molecular channel because the movement of SBD molecules along the
functional channel requires a high free-energy change of 171.7 kJ·mol–1. Considering that the exit path for SBD molecules
out of D3R is the same as that for dopamine out of the
D3R internal structure, SBD can “dredge”
the protective molecular channel to increase the movement of dopamine
out of the internal structure of D3R because SBD as a drug
is of a high concentration relative to dopamine and has a selective
movement along the protective molecular channel. This will also help
to reduce the presence of dopamine within D3R and prevent
dopamine molecules from excessively functioning as neurotransmitters,
which contributes to the severity of schizophrenia symptoms.

Besides D3R, D1R, D2R, D4R, and D5R are all important systems for researches of
schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease. D3R has strong
homology with them and much common characteristics with them. At the
first stage, because D3R is only one crystal protein structure
of dopamine receptors, it is important for D3R used as
a representative of them to study the free-energy changes for SBD
moving along the molecular channels within D3R. In the
crystal structure of D3R protein, for obtaining the stable
protein crystal, the researchers used ETQ, an antagonist that is designed
to stabilize the protein structure and facilitate protein crystallization.
However, ETQ does not change the D3R structure very much;
therefore, in any case, it is significant to study the free-energy
changes for some molecules like dopamine moving along the molecular
channels within D3R. In the next stage, we are studying
the changes of free energy for SBD moving along the channels within
the simulated D1R, D2R, D4R, and
D5R protein structures to investigate the different characteristics
for SBD moving in these channels.

It is noted that our study
idea is different from the traditional
blocking method of representing antipsychotic activity. Our strategy
to study schizophrenia is through dredging rather than blocking dopamine
molecular channels. This result is characterized by SBD moving along the protective
channel in the change of free energy being lower at 68.1 kJ·mol–1 than it is along the functional channel, and animal
experiments have demonstrated its efficacy for the treatment of schizophrenia.
Similarly, we found three molecules preferentially moving through
the functional channel because the free-energy barrier for them moving
along the functional channel is lower at 60 kJ·mol–1 than it is for them moving along the protective channel, and animal
experiments proved them to be effective for the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease.

In addition, the method of umbrella sampling is widely
used to
study changes of free energy for some molecules moving along the molecular
passages, which is a typical method, by which a lot of work has been
published. For the interaction energies between SBD and the active
sites of D3R, we use quantum chemical calculation, an effective
and useful method, by which many articles have also been published.
More details in consistence with some corresponding experiments are
described in the section of Methods and some
references.

Conclusions
The free-energy change
of 103.6 kJ·mol–1 shows that SBD molecules
are more easily accessible along the protective
channels within D3R. The access of SBD molecules is significant
because this can help clear protective channels within the D3R structure and aid removal of dopamine molecules out of the D3R internal structure along the x+ axis, which
prevents excessive neurotransmitter functioning of dopamine. Therefore,
SBD has good potential as a drug for schizophrenia treatment and its
pharmacology is closely related to its transmission dynamics along
molecular channels and mechanism of transmission channels within dopamine
receptors.

Methods
Details of the D3R complex protein
structure used in
this study are based on results of our previous study.20,22 This D3R complex protein with DA was obtained using docking
technology and molecular dynamics based on the crystal structure of
mutated D3R (crystal number: 3PBL),19 in which
the original protein crystal structure for point mutations of amino
acids had been mutated to the human amino acid sequence of D3R. In the crystal structure of the D3R protein, researchers
introduced hydrophilic fragments between the TM3 and 4 to obtain the
stable protein crystal. This fragment, which is not a sequence of
the D3R protein itself, was removed from the structure
because it is far from SBD and has little effect to SBD. The reason
is that there are similar research systems between DA and SBD with
D3R complex proteins; in our previous work, the binding
free energy between DA molecule and D3R protein had been
demonstrated to largely come from the residues within 0.6 nm of the
D3R structure around the DA molecule.19 Furthermore, it will hinder the membrane system construction.
Besides, the original reverse-direction dimer form of D3R was obtained for stabilizing the crystal structure of membrane
protein;20 in fact, it is a single D3R protein structure. The research system of our study is for
SBD moving within the channels of single D3R protein structure,
so that it is a common preferable practice to use a single D3R protein structure.

The external condition of the biomembrane
is important for the
structural stability of membrane proteins. On the basis of our previous
research,20,29 we used the phosphatidyl-choline molecule
(1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC)) to construct
a lipid biological bilayer membrane. At the end of POPC, there is
an unsaturated C=C double bond, which is preferentially used
in the simulation of biological cell membrane over the saturated tail
of phospholipid lipid molecules.30−33 The POPC membrane–water
model constructed using POPC phospholipid molecules has been previously
reported in the literature,30 whereas water
molecules belong to SPC model molecules.34,35

SBD
Molecule Docked with D3R
Considering
the structure of the D3R–DA complex protein, SBD
was docked onto the D3R protein using the Dock6 program.36 The docking step is similar to that reported
in the literature,20 where MP2/6-3lG(d,p)
was used to optimize the molecular structure of SBD,37 whereas the DA molecule in the D3R–DA
complex was used as a pointer molecule to obtain the D3R–SBD complex. The docking energy from the lowest energy conformation
of SBD binding with D3R was determined to be −51.4
kJ·mol–1.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
of D3R–SBD Complex
Protein Structure
Gromacs 4.5 program was utilized to perform
molecular dynamics simulations of the D3R–SBD complex
structure, and the results were analyzed using the VMD program.38−41 SBD molecular force field parameters were written in Gromos96 force
field format, and POPC molecular force field parameters were derived
from previous literature30 and then rewritten
into Gromacs format data. At the beginning stage, energy optimization
was used to eliminate the system’s atomic coordinates from
overlapping by choosing the steepest descent method for maximum 40 000
steps (Fmax < 100 kJ·mol–1·nm–1). Under 1 atm pressure and 310 K, this allowed water molecules to
move following LINCS constraint algorithm using 200 ps-limited stimulation,
whereas Berendsen coupling and temperature pressure coupling algorithms
were used to set respective time constants to 0.1 and 5 ps. Periodic
boundary conditions were applied in the system of 20 ns with each
step of 2 fs for molecular dynamics simulations. For every 2000 steps
(4 ps), a system file was recorded and output studies to calculate
the various energies and analyze structural changes.

Trajectory
and Free Energy Potential Surface of SBD Moving within
D3R
On the basis of the D3R–SBD–POPC–H2O system, after molecular dynamic simulation, the trajectories
for SBD moving within D3R were simulated using the method
of umbrella samples from Gromacs 4.5 package41 to calculate their free-energy potential surfaces. The principle
to calculate the free-energy potential surface is based on the formula G = −RT  ln K, where G is free energy and K is the equilibrium constant obtained via molecular simulation. Because
similar simulations and calculations have been reported in related
articles,25,42−45 we do not introduce the details
of simulation but simply provide important points. In this work, we
used the system file obtained after the molecular dynamics simulation
as the input file of the trajectory dynamics structure system and
the topology file necessary for simulating the dynamics trajectories
of SBD was the same as it in its simulation of the molecular dynamics
structure. SBD was set as the moving group, the harmonic force constant
was set to be 2000 kJ·mol–1·nm–1, and the maximum speed of SBD moving was limited at 10 nm·ns–1. Using the Nose–Hoover temperature coupling
algorithm and Parrinello–Rahman pressure coupling algorithm,
respective time constants were set to 0.2 and 1 ps at 310 K and 1
atm as the reference temperature and pressure, respectively. Along
the positive and negative directions of X, Z, and Y, the simulation of trajectory
dynamics was performed for 500 000 steps, with a step length
of 2 fs. The appropriate residue contrary to the direction of movement
was selected as the reference group.

According to the rule of
0.05 nm similarly reported in the literature,24 the appropriate umbrella samples could be selected from the trajectory
data file. During the formation of trajectory for SBD moving within
D3R, the given force less than 2000 kJ·mol–1 prompted SBD to move and resulted in deformation of SBD molecules,
whereas the total structures of SBD and D3R deviated from
their equilibrium. Therefore, it was necessary to perform simulation
of umbrella samples, i.e., under the condition of limited distance
between the moving and reference groups, so that the SBD molecule
and total system were rebalanced. The input files for simulation of
the umbrella samples included the sample, topological, and pointer
files with the parameter file. The parameters for the simulation of
the umbrella samples were the same as those for the simulation of
trajectories but with a speed set to 0 nm·ns–1, indicating that the SBD molecule does not move along the trajectory;
considering the distance between the two groups, rebalancing of the
molecular dynamics simulations of the samples were determined using
RMSD values, where simulations steps were set to 400 000 (800
ps) with a step length of 2 fs. Finally, from the biased sampling
results of partial sampling into no statistical results and from a
series of umbrella sample simulations, the weighted histogram analysis
method from Gromacs 4.5 was used to extract the potential of mean
force (PMF) with a calculation deviation of 10–6 kJ·mol–1 (convergence calculation standard).46 The PMF surface refers to the free-energy potential
surface from which the free binding energy can be calculated. Another
file output via the calculation of G_wham provides histogram data.
If the overlap of histogram figures is not good, it will produce a
zigzag type potential energy surface of PMF. On the contrary, our
research results repeatedly show no occurrence of a zigzag type PMF
potential energy surface, which means good overlap of the histogram
figures.22,24,25 This good
overlap of the umbrella samples suggests that the WHAM method can
be effectively used to calculate the reliability of ΔG values.43 In addition, although
there is no direct comparison of the experimental data, the reliability
of free energy obtained by molecular dynamics simulations can be proved
by comparing relevant experiments. As reported in the previous literature,
the PMF method can be used to simulate the permeation of water molecules
through the modeled POPC biological membranes, where the free-energy
barrier is 16.8–29.4 kJ·mol–1,47−52 whereas the experimental barrier is 16.8–37.8 kJ·mol–1 for water molecules passing through the cell membrane.53−56 From these previously reported results, it is obvious that the simulation
results are in good agreement with experimental results to demonstrate
the reliability of the method used in this work. In another recent
study, the same PMF method was utilized to calculate Na+–Cl– ion pair, Cl– ion,
and Na+ ion permeating through the POPC biological membrane
and their free energy barriers were determined to be 115.0, 99.1,
and 92.0 kJ·mol–1, respectively,57 whereas the barriers determined via the experiment
were 98.7 ± 11.3 and 87.4 ± 1.7, respectively, for Cl– and Na+ ions permeating through a phosphatidylserine
membrane.58 Considering that the latter-mentioned
molecular simulation results showed good consistency with experimental
results for Cl– and Na+ ions, it is expected
that both results in the similar biomembrane system should also be
consistent in this work.22
