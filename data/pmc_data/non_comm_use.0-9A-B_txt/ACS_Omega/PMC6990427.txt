Significant improvement in mechanical properties and
shape recovery
in polyurethanes can be obtained by cross-linking, usually performed
in a traditional chemical fashion. Here, we report model studies of
enzymatic transamidations of urethane-bond-containing esters to study
the principles of an enzymatic build-up of covalent cross-linked polyurethane
networks via amide bond formation. The Lipase-catalyzed transamidation
reaction of a urethane-bond-containing model ester ethyl 2-(hexylcarbamoyloxy)propanoate
with various amines is discussed. A side product was formed, that
could be successfully identified, and its synthesis reduced to a minimum
(<1%). Furthermore, a noncatalyzed transamidation that is performed
without CalB as the catalyst could be observed. Both observations
are due to the known high reactivity of amines with urethane bonds.

Introduction
Although the use of biobased monomers
or building blocks has become
an established way of sustainable chemistry performance, the processes
for the end-product synthesis are still mainly focused on conventional
chemical routes.1 Such chemical product
syntheses are often performed under harsh conditions such as high
temperature, low pH, and high pressure; also, these syntheses result
in low catalytic efficiency and lack of enantiomeric specificity for
the synthesis of, for example, chiral molecules. Due to the increasing
awareness of sustainable and less hazardous chemistry, researcher
have become more and more interested in generating alternative, biobased
routes for polyurethane (PU) synthesis.2−8

Significant improvement in mechanical properties and shape
recovery
in PUs can be obtained by cross-linking, usually performed in a traditional
chemical fashion. Enzymes in general show several advantages, making
their use in organic and polymer chemistry promising for the synthesis
of various chemical compounds, including monomers9−16 and polymers.17−26 Enzymes are able to catalyze a broad range of reactions such as
redox reactions, hydrolysis reactions, and transesterification and
transamidation reactions with high stereo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity.27 Intensive work in enzyme engineering to overcome
former disadvantages as a limited substrate range and instability
under chemical reaction conditions have now made enzymes competitive
catalysts compared with classical chemical approaches.27

Here, we report the enzymatic transamidation
of urethane-bond-containing
esters. The reported synthetic procedures are model reactions for
a possible enzymatic build-up of covalent cross-linked polyurethane
networks via amide bond formation. This is a novel approach that has
not been studied so far and therefore this initial fundamental study
is needed to show the applicability of enzymes, especially lipases,
to catalyze the amide bond formation between an urethane-bond-containing
model ester and model amides. These simple transamidation reactions
will be able to provide a first insight into the advantages and disadvantages
of lipases as biocatalysts for future polyurethane network synthesis.

The lipase B from the fungi Candida antarctica (CalB) is the most commonly and successfully used biocatalyst in
organic and polymer chemistry and was already reported to catalyze
amide formation in polymer synthesis.28−45 In general, enzymes show an increase in stability performance when
immobilized46 and this is also true for
CalB. In its immobilized form, CalB is highly thermostable and can
be used several thousand hours at 60–80 °C without any
significant loss of activity.47−54 The most common commercially available form of immobilized CalB
is Novozym435 (Novozymes). Here, 10 wt % of CalB are physically absorbed
on 90 wt % of a macroporous DVB-cross-linked methacrylate polymer
resin (Lewatit VP OC 1600 beads).55−57 In this immobilized
form, CalB can then work not only under mild but also under extreme
reaction conditions.58−60

In this report, the Lipase-catalyzed transamidation
reaction of
a urethane-bond-containing model ester ethyl 2-(hexylcarbamoyloxy)propanoate
with various amines is discussed. Ethyl 2-(hexylcarbamoyloxy)propanoate
is a very suitable model compound for this purpose, as its chemical
structure is relatively simple yet resembles those of industrially
valuable urethane compounds.

Results and Discussion
The transamidation of the monofunctional
model ester ethyl 2-(hexylcarbamoyloxy)propanoate
proceeds readily using octylamine as the amine part leading to 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl
hexylcarbamate (Figure 1) as the product. Ethanol is produced as a byproduct due to the substitution
of the ethyl functional group within the monofunctional ester with
octylamine by amide bond formation. It is removed from the reaction
by absorbance via molecular sieves that are applied in every transamidation
reaction.

with octylamine. (B) Experimental setup of transamidation.

The initial transamidation reactions of the monofunctional
ester
with octylamine via the method outlined in Figure 1 revealed two major problems: (a) a side
product is produced with and without CalB and (b) transamidation also
occurred without CalB in a noncatalyzed way. Although the amount of
produced side product is usually quite low (<1%), identification
and an explanation for its synthesis are necessary for the already
mentioned basic understanding of the enzymatically catalyzed transamidation.
The noncatalyzed or to be more precise nonactive catalyzed transamidation
is most likely due to an interaction between the highly reactive octylamine
and the urethane bond within the monofunctional ester.61 This assumption was experimentally proven by
the transamidation of a nonurethane-bond-containing ester, ethyl isobutyrate,
that only showed product formation with CalB as the enzymatic catalyst
and no side product occurrence.

The product and side product
yields were calculated based on the
purified products and side products after transamidation. Due to a
general material loss (40–50%) during purification via column
chromatography, the sum of the yield of purified products and side
product amounts will be usually around 50–60% or lower. For
the identification and structural elucidation of the synthesized side
product during transamidation of the monofunctional ester with octylamine,
the transamidation reaction was performed based on the experimental
setup in Figure 1B.
The side product was separated from the transamidation product via
column chromatography and analyzed by 1H, 13C NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization high-resolution mass
spectrometry (ESI-HRMS).

The obtained results are in accordance
with previously reported
reactions of urethane bonds or specifically of carbamates.62,63 The side product could be clearly identified as 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl
octylcarbamate via 1H and 13C NMR Figure 2.

product 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl octylcarbamate. (A) 1H NMR spectrum of 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl octylcarbamate.
Traces from possible intermediate side products are marked with an
asterisk. (B) 13C NMR spectrum of 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl
octylcarbamate. Identified impurities and nonidentified impurities
are labeled.

Additionally, with the gained information, it was
possible to establish
the synthesis route of this side product with all occurring intermediates:
during the transamidation reaction of the monofunctional ester with
octylamine resulting in the main product 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl
hexylcarbamate and ethanol as the byproduct, the monofunctional ester
is split into its components hexamethylene isocyanate, 2-hydroxypropanoic
acid, and ethanol. From these molecules, two intermediates are formed:
3,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione by the cyclization of two 2-hydroxypropanoic
acid molecules and 3-hexyl-5-methyloxazolidine-2,4-dione by the reaction
of hexamethylene isocyanate and 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The 3-hexyl-5-methyloxazolidine-2,4-dione
is then decyclized, the hexamethylene isocyanate part is released,
and two octylamine molecules are attached by transamidation, leading
the main side product 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl octylcarbamate Figure 3.

Figure 3 Structural side product
and intermediate product elucidation of
the transamidation of the monofunctional ester with octylamine.

In conclusion, the synthesized side product 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl
octylcarbamate, in very low amounts, is nearly the same as the produced
transamidation product 1-(octylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl hexylcarbamate,
with the hexylene carbon chain replaced by a second octylene chain
but produced via a longer intermediate route.

The fact that
the side product could already be identified and
is only synthesized in small amounts (<1%) makes it a more or less
negligible parameter for transamidation. An even higher impact has
the occurrence of noncatalyzed transamidation. As already mentioned,
enzymes, specifically lipases should be used for the catalysis of
amide bond formation due to their advantages of being environmentally
friendly and highly stereo-, regio-, and enantioselective. This autocatalytic
transamidation occurs independently from the applied enzyme or monomer
amount and independent from the chosen monomer ratio. Amines have
in general a more nucleophilic character than alcohols due to the
higher electron negativity of the nitrogen in the amine compared to
the oxygen in the alcohol. The use of the primary aliphatic octylamine
further enhances this effect due to the electron-releasing character
of carbons in the octylamine chain. This inductive (+I) effect explains
the high reactivity of octylamine to self-catalyze the amide bond
formation. Another difference between transamidation and transesterification
of the monofunctional ester is that a complete conversion of the monofunctional
ester is achieved in transamidation, with CalB as a catalyst and without
CalB.

If now transamidations are performed in a nonactive, noncontrolled
way mediated by an interaction of amine and the urethane bond of the
ester,61−63 enzyme-catalyzed amide bond formation for cross-linking
of urethanes is not an option. Therefore, the conditions were varied
to find an experimental setup for transamidation in which no noncatalyzed
transamidation product is formed.

The most obvious first parameter
to change for avoiding the noncatalyzed
transamidation is the applied monomer ratio (1:2) because if the noncatalyzed
transamidation is mediated by octylamine acting itself as a catalyst
and thereby reacting with the monofunctional ester, its amount should
be reduced. Table 1 shows a summary of all changed parameters within the experimental
setup. In every performed transamidation reaction, the product was
also synthesized when CalB was not present; however, with these optimization
approaches, it could be shown that the results gained with the previously
selected experimental setup (Figure 1) with transamidation for 24 h could also be achieved
with a reduced reaction time of 2 h (Figure 4C). Additionally, different amines were tested
to identify one that is not as reactive as octylamine: two different
primary amines (butylamine, dodecylamine) were tested, three primary
heteroatom amines (2-ethoxyethylamine, 2-methoyethylamine, N-methylethylenediamine) and a primary diamine (1,8-diaminooctane).
All of these amines were able to self-catalyze their transamidation
with the monofunctional ester.

setup for transamidation.

In summary, this means that the noncatalyzed amide
bond formation
due to the high reactivity of the amines with the urethane bond of
the used model monofunctional ester is still the major drawback of
the enzymatic transamidation reaction. A solution could be to design
a different model urethane ester in which the urethane bond has more
structural distance to the ester group, thus reducing the chance of
the amine to react with the urethane bond.

Although it was not
possible to find an experimental setup or an
amine where no noncatalyzed transamidation occurred, at least the
generated side product together with its synthesis route was elucidated,
as well as the best experimental setup for transamidation was identified
(Figure 4B). With this
setup, transamidation of the monofunctional ester with octylamine
yields about 30% product with and without CalB and less than 1% side
product (Figure 4C).

The used model monofunctional ester seems not to be the best choice
for a model compound for studying the efficiency of enzyme-catalyzed
amide bond formation. To still be able to test the CalB substrate
preferences for different amines, the already analyzed nonurethane-bond-containing
ester, ethyl isobutyrate, was used. Amines from different amine groups
were tested and are listed with the transamidation results in Table 2. The transamidation
reaction with the aromatic amine aniline and all of the tested primary
amines, except the constitutional isomer 4-heptylamine, showed a product
only with CalB and complete monomer conversion (ethyl isobutyrate
and amine). In addition, the secondary amine N-methylpropylamine
reacted with ethyl isobutyrate only when catalyzed by CalB, but here
both monomers were not completely converted, and a side product was
formed. Complete monomer conversion can most probably be achieved
by increasing the reaction time and temperature. For both the primary
amine constitutional isomer 4-heptylamine and the tested diamine 1,8-diaminooctane,
no product was detected after transamidation with ethyl isobutyrate.
It can be concluded that immobilized CalB is able to accept a large
range of amines together with the tested nonurethane-bond-containing
ester ethyl isobutyrate.

Conclusions
The reported basic research performed on
lipase applicability for
transamidation of a urethane-bond-containing ester with amines gives
a detailed insight into the complex dependency of a successful, highly
efficient product formation on the chosen reaction conditions and
components.

The transamidation of the urethane-containing monofunctional
ester
and octylamine shows two major drawbacks: First, the occurrence of
a side product, which nevertheless could be successfully identified
and its synthesis reduced to a minimum (<1%). Second, the undesirable
noncatalyzed transamidation that occurs without CalB as the catalyst.62,63 Although several attempts have been made to prevent noncatalyzed
transamidation, such as changing the transamidation time and temperature
as well as the amine, transamidation in this current system is a combination
of enzyme-catalyzed and self-catalyzed processes leading to the complete
conversion of the monofunctional ester with a product yield of 30%.

The obtained results can lead to procedures for the enzymatic cross-linking
of polyurethanes via amide bonds, these methods can be promising approaches
for a more sustainable and less hazardous synthesis of polyurethane
networks.

Materials and Methods
All the alcohols, amines, and solvents were purchased with a purity
of 98% or higher. Toluene (CAS number: 108-88-3), anhydrous, for transesterification
and transamidation reactions, C. antarctica lipase B on acrylic resin (CalB, Novozym435, 5000 + U/g; CAS number:
9001-62-1), molecular sieves (4 Å, CAS number: 70955-01-0), and
Chloroform-d (CAS number: 865-49-6) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Ethyl isobutyrate (CAS number: 97-62-1), octylamine (CAS number: 111-86-4),
2-ethoxyethylamine (CAS number: 110-76-9), and 2-methoxyethylamine
(CAS number: 109-85-3) were purchased from TCI Chemicals. Ethyl 2-(hexylcarbamoyloxy)propanoate
was provided by Covestro, Germany. Solvesso100 (CAS number: 64742-95-6)
was purchased from Brenntag Holland. Lewatit beads (Lewatit VP OC
1600) were obtained from Lanxess. Solvents for thin-layer chromatography
(2.1.3) and column chromatography (2.1.4) were of high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade from Macron Fine Chemicals. Silica
gel 60/Kieselguhr F254 thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
plates were purchased from Merck, and SiliaFlash P60 for column chromatography
was purchased from SiliCycle.

General Procedure for CalB-Catalyzed Transamidation
CalB, Lewatit beads, and molecular sieves were predried for 24 h
in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) at room temperature under high vacuum. The monofunctional ester,
the amine, predried CalB, predried Lewatit beads (for the negative
control reaction), predried molecular sieves, and the solvent and/or
cosolvent were added in different amounts into a 10 mL round-bottom
flask. The reaction was magnetically stirred at 150 rpm in an oil
bath. After flushing out remaining air under reduced pressure (350
mmHg), the reaction was performed either at different temperatures
for different times under atmospheric nitrogen environment or under
reduced pressure of 200 mmHg. For each transesterification, a negative
control reaction was performed, here CalB or a different immobilized
lipase was replaced by Lewatit beads.

After the transamidation,
5 mL of chloroform was added into the reaction flask to stop the reaction
and to solve the products. Immobilized lipases or Lewatit beads and
molecular sieves were filtered out by filtration, including washing
the filter two times with 2 mL of chloroform. The chloroform was removed
by evaporation at 40 °C under reduced pressure (356 mmHg).

The transamidation products were verified by thin-layer chromatography,
subsequently purified by column chromatography to calculate the pure
product yield and analyzed by 1H and 13C measurements.

Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC)
Thin-layer chromatography
for the detection of purified and unpurified reaction products was
performed using Silica gel 60/Kieselguhr F254 TLC plates
and an ethyl acetate/n-hexane solvent mixture (ratio
1:3). Ten to twenty milligrams of the sample was diluted in 1:200
ethyl acetate/n-hexane mixture. One microliter of
the diluted sample was applied on the TLC plate. The compounds within
the sample were detected using a potassium permanganate solution (10
g/L KMNO4, 67 g/L K2CO3, 1.7% (v/v)
NaOH solution (5% stock concentration)) and subsequently heating to
150 °C.

Column Chromatography
Column chromatography for reaction
product purification was performed under gravity flow using the silica
gel SiliaFlash P60 and an ethyl acetate/n-hexane
solvent mixture (ratio 1:3).

The size of the used column was
dependent on the reaction product amount to be purified (<1 g:
column diameter 1 cm; 1–2 g: column diameter 2 cm; 2–5
g: column diameter 5 cm; >5 g: column diameter: 8 cm). During chromatography,
1 mL of fractions were taken and analyzed by TLC for product elution.
Fractions containing the corresponding products were pooled and the
remaining ethyl acetate/n-hexane solvent mixture
was removed by evaporation at 40 °C under reduced pressure (ethyl
acetate: 180 mmHg; n-hexane: 270 mm Hg). The purified
products were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR measurements,
and the product yield of the previous reaction was determined by  

1H and 13C NMR Measurements
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian
VXR spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 13C NMR analyses), using CDCl3-d1 as the solvent. For NMR spectra evaluation, the software
MestReNova (Version: 6.0.2-5475) was used. The chemical shifts reported
were referenced to the resonance of CDCl3-d1.

Electrospray Ionization High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (ESI-HRMS)
For the determination of the molecular weight of the transamidation
side product, purified side product with a concentration of 1 mg was
dissolved in dichloromethane and diluted 200-fold in acetonitrile
with 0.1% formic acid to generate Na-adduct ions and if necessary
0.1% NH4OH to generate NH4-adduct ions. The
dissolved and diluted samples were introduced to the mass spectrometry
by a syringe pump with direct infusion at a flow rate of 10 μL/min.
The spectra were acquired with electrospray ionization in a scan range
from 75 to 2500 amu in the positive-ion mode on the maXis plus mass
spectrometer (Bruker).
