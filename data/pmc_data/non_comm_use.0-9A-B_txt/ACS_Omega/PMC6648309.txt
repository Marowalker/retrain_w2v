Highly concentrated water-in-oil
emulsions incorporating multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are prepared. Homogeneous and selective
dispersions of MWCNTs throughout the oil phase of the emulsions are
investigated. The practical insolubility of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
in aqueous and organic media necessitates the disentanglement of CNT
“agglomerates” through the utilization of functionalized
CNTs. The design and synthesis of two tetra-alkylated pyrene derivatives,
namely, 1,3,6,8-tetra(oct-1-yn-1-yl)pyrene (TOPy) and
1,3,6,8-tetra(dodec-1-yn-1-yl)pyrene (TDPy), for the
noncovalent organic modification of MWCNTs are reported. The modifier
molecules are designed in such a manner that they facilitate an improved
dispersion of individualized MWCNTs in the continuous-oil phase of
the highly concentrated emulsion (HCE). Transmission electron microscopic
analyses suggest that the alkylated pyrene molecules are adsorbed
on the MWCNT surface, and their adsorption eventually results in the
debundling of MWCNT agglomerates. Fourier transform infrared, Raman,
and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses confirm the π–π
interaction between the alkylated pyrene molecules and MWCNTs. The
noncovalent modification significantly improves the effective debundling
and selective dispersion of MWCNTs in HCEs.

1 Introduction
Highly
concentrated emulsions (HCEs) possess an internal (dispersed)
phase volume fraction (ϕ) greater than 0.74, the maximum possible
volume fraction of nondeformable monodisperse spheres in hexagonal
close packing. In HCEs, ϕ can be as high as 96–99%, and
the structure consists of a polydisperse–polyhedral droplet
system separated by a thin film of the continuous phase.1−3 HCEs retain their original structure even at extremely high values
of ϕ by virtue of the polydispersity and the deformation of
spherical droplets to polyhedral ones.4,5 Apart from
its extensive use in the food industry, cosmetics, paints, oil recovery,
and commercial explosives, HCEs are also widely used as reaction media
for chemical- and enzyme-catalyzed reactions6−8 as well as templates
for the preparation of low-density materials like poly-high internal
phase emulsion (polyHIPE) foams.9−11 Emulsion explosives that are
widely used for commercial blasting in the mining industry are primarily
highly concentrated water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions.

Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) are being widely used to improve the thermal,
electrical, and mechanical properties of a variety of materials, including
ceramics, metals, and polymers. Several studies were reported on HCEs
incorporating nanoparticles, including multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs), either as Pickering stabilizers or co-stabilizers.12−16 CNTs with various surface functionalities were incorporated into
HCEs to prepare conductive polyHIPE foams with a low electrical percolation
threshold.17−21 A significant level of understanding about the formation of electrically
percolating MWCNT networks in HCEs has been gained from these studies
on polyHIPE composite foams. Kim et al. have reported a percolation
threshold of less than 1 wt % in polyHIPE foams.18

In our previous investigation, nanotube-incorporated
HCEs were
prepared, wherein MWCNTs were added into the continuous phase of w/o
HCEs to achieve a MWCNT “network-like” structure within
the emulsion.16 The oil phase of less than
10 wt % of the total emulsion and hence, the MWCNTs network can be
achieved with a reasonably low amount of MWCNTs, provided MWCNTs are
effectively debundled and selectively dispersed in the oil phase of
the emulsion. It is crucial that the MWCNTs should remain in the continuous
phase of the emulsion and not diffuse to the oil–water interface,
because this may adversely affect the emulsion stability. An efficient
MWCNT network within the emulsion could impart additional characteristics
or modify the thermal and electrical properties of the emulsion. It
is believed that an improvement in the emulsion thermal conductivity
could significantly enhance the performance of emulsion explosives.

However, developing a homogeneous dispersion involving “individualized”
MWCNTs in the oil blend (which forms the continuous phase of the HCE)
remains a difficult task. It was noticed earlier that a fraction of
MWCNTs remained in the agglomerated-state in the emulsion matrix.16 Moreover, the fraction of remaining MWCNT agglomerates
increased with the increase in MWCNT concentration in the HCE. CNTs
aggregate into bundles or ropes with strong van der Waals interactions
during their synthesis, limiting their superior properties.22 Many of the proposed applications of CNTs have
been limited by their poor solubility in aqueous and organic solvents.23 Hence, it is necessary to debundle the CNT agglomerates
to prepare functional CNT-based composites or suspensions.

In
view of this, the present investigation focuses on the effective
debundling along with the selective dispersion of MWCNTs to localize
them in the oil phase of the HCE. Several covalent and noncovalent
functionalization strategies were reported to debundle and to disperse
CNTs in various dispersion media. Although the covalent functionalization
of CNT surfaces can significantly improve the dispersibility of CNTs
in various solvents, it alters the sp2 carbon framework
and adversely affects the intrinsic physical properties of CNTs.23 In contrast, the noncovalent modification of
CNTs preserves their intrinsic properties to a great extent, and it
involves the adsorption of appropriate modifier molecules onto the
CNT surfaces via hydrophobic, van der Waals, and/or electrostatic
interactions.24 Conventional surfactants
are not recommended for dispersing MWCNTs in the oil phase of HCEs,
as they could disturb the structure and the stability of the emulsion.
During the preparation of conductive polyHIPE foams through HCEs,
it was noticed that the utilization of water-soluble surfactants to
disperse CNTs resulted in unstable HCEs.18,25 This is because the surfactant destabilizes the film between the
droplets, which is stabilized by the emulsifier of the HCE.

Pyrene-containing compounds have often been used for the noncovalent
functionalization due to the very high affinity of pyrene toward the
CNT surface.26−37 Pyrene derivatives adsorb on the CNT surface via π–π
interactions, preventing the formation of bundles and enabling its
dispersion in solvents.38,39 Apart from their use
as noncovalent stabilizing units, pyrene derivatives were also used
to anchor various systems to CNTs in diverse applications. Furthermore,
the pyrene ring offers several possibilities of peripheral group modifications,
which can affect the condensed-matter structure.40 It has been reported that the unsubstituted pyrene forms
monoclinic crystals, whereas some of the tetra-substituted pyrene
derivatives exhibit stacking and form liquid crystalline columnar
phases.41,42

Noncovalent functionalization of MWCNTs
with pyrene derivatives
of long hydrocarbon chains may be an efficient way to achieve a stable
and selective dispersion of debundled MWCNTs in HCEs. The pyrene ring
will ensure the adsorption of the modifier molecules on the surface
of the MWCNT through π–π stacking via coupling
of π–π interactions (between the sp2 carbons of the aromatic pyrenyl group and MWCNT), and the hydrocarbon
chains would interact and allow the MWCNTs to be localized in the
oil blend. Two alkylated pyrene derivatives have been chosen for the
surface modification of MWCNTs, namely, 1,3,6,8-tetra(oct-1-yn-1-yl)pyrene
(TOPy) and 1,3,6,8-tetra(dodec-1-yn-1-yl)pyrene (TDPy). The two derivatives differ in the side chains that
are located on the 1,3,6,8-positions of the pyrene core. TOPy consists of an n-octyl chain; on the other hand, TDPy contains an n-dodecyl group. Two alkynes
were chosen to assess the influence of the side chain length on the
solubilizing power of the modifier molecule. Side chains could have
a profound influence on the molecular arrangement as well as on the
interaction with the surrounding environment.

These two pyrene
derivatives have been synthesized, and their effectiveness
as a noncovalent modifier has been investigated in detail. The effect
of the noncovalent modification on MWCNT debundling and the interaction
between the modifier and MWCNTs were assessed. Furthermore, the modified
MWCNTs were incorporated into w/o HCEs, and the influence of noncovalent
modification on the dispersion state of MWCNTs was investigated. A
model w/o emulsion system with ϕ greater than 90 wt %, which
has rheological characteristics identical to those of emulsion explosive
precursors, was chosen for this study.

2 Results
and discussion
2.1 Influence of the Noncovalent
Modification
on the Morphology and the “Agglomerate State” of MWCNTs
The nature of interactions between MWCNTs and the dispersing medium
dictates the “dispersibility” of MWCNTs in a medium.
In the case of the modified MWCNTs, the interaction between MWCNTs
and the modifier molecules is also important. To establish an understanding
of the dispersion state and the extent of the debundling of MWCNTs,
the investigation of the dispersion of MWCNTs was carried out at the
“microscale” and “nanoscale” levels. The
average agglomerate size of MWCNTs was determined by microscale investigations,
such as optical microscopy and sedimentation observations, whereas
the debundling of MWCNT agglomerates was examined on the nanoscale
with the help of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analyses.

Sedimentation behavior of
nanotubes in the presence of the modifier molecule is an important
parameter to estimate the dispersibility of MWCNTs. The unmodified
and modified MWCNTs were dispersed in tetrahydrofuran (THF), and their
sedimentation behavior was examined. The dispersion of the unmodified
MWCNTs was highly unstable, and sedimentation was observed after a
few minutes of ultrasonication. On the other hand, both 1:1 and 1:2
modified MWCNTs were stable for a few days in THF (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Furthermore,
dispersion studies of MWCNTs were carried out in the
oil blend, where the oil blend composition was the same as that of
the continuous phase of the emulsion (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This investigation could provide
crucial insights into the influence of the noncovalent modification
on the dispersion state of MWCNTs in the oil phase of the emulsion.
The size of the MWCNT agglomerates that remained in the oil blend–MWCNT
dispersion was determined using optical microscopic analysis for the
unmodified and modified MWCNTs (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The average agglomerate size for
the unmodified MWCNTs was observed to be ∼218.2 μm2, whereas for 1:1 (w/w) TOPy- and TDPy-modified MWCNTs, it was ∼109.9 and ∼93.4 μm2, respectively (Figure S3 in the
Supporting Information). With the increase in the modifier weight
ratio, the agglomerate size was further reduced to ∼75.6 and
∼73.2 μm2, respectively, for the 1:2 (w/w) TOPy- and TDPy-modified MWCNTs. Thus, the dispersion
with unmodified MWCNTs exhibited a higher average agglomerate size
as compared to all corresponding modified MWCNTs. However, there was
no significant variation in the average agglomerate sizes of modified
MWCNTs, between these two modifiers at a specific modifier concentration.
For the modified MWCNTs, the average size of MWCNT agglomerates reduced
with increasing weight ratio of TOPy and TDPy. Similar observations were reported for MWCNTs that were surface-modified
using 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde and sodium/lithium salt of 6-aminohexanoic
acid.43,44

Pyrene derivatives have been reported
to interact with the nanotube
surface with a high surface coverage because of the very high affinity
of pyrene toward the CNT surface.26,27,30−34 Pyrene derivatives adsorb onto the surface of CNTs through π–π
interactions, preventing the bundle formation and enabling its dispersion
in solvents.38,39 It is also likely that the TOPy and TDPy molecules may form a “layer-like
structure”, while covering the surface of MWCNTs, owing to
better packing offered by the matching aromatic structure. Lerner
et al. demonstrated the stacking of pyrene molecules on a nanotube
surface through an increased thickness of the nanotube, as observed
in AFM studies.38 Furthermore, it was demonstrated
through molecular simulation that the stability of the complex of
pyrene with the nanotube is greater than that between two pyrene molecules.27 Thus, the pyrene molecule and its derivatives
have the tendency to interact with the nanotube surface and form a
complex rather than assembling themselves.

The morphology of
the unmodified and modified MWCNTs, as observed
in TEM and SEM analyses, is shown in Figure 1. The unmodified MWCNTs exhibited a highly
agglomerated state, whereas the TOPy- and TDPy-modified MWCNTs showed a less agglomerated state. TEM micrographs
(Figure 1a–e)
illustrate the debundling of MWCNTs upon modification. As observed
from the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) micrographs, which were imaged
at 300k magnification, the unmodified MWCNTs show a relatively smooth
surface (Figure 1f),
whereas the TEM micrographs of the modified MWCNTs exhibit roughness
on the outer wall, which is expected to have originated from the modifier
molecules that adhered to the surface of the MWCNTs (Figure 1g–j). The SEM micrographs
of unmodified and modified MWCNTs depict an “entangled”
network of MWCNTs. However, it is expected that the “agglomerate-strength”
of the MWCNTs may decrease with the modification due to the effective
debundling.

Figure 1 TEM and SEM micrographs of the unmodified and modified MWCNTs:
(a)–(e) at 50k magnification; (f–j) high-resolution
TEM images of unmodified and modified MWCNTs, at 300k magnification;
(k–o) SEM images at 100k magnification.

Furthermore, the average diameters of the unmodified and
modified
MWCNTs were estimated from the HR-TEM images. The increase in the
average diameter of MWCNTs suggests the adsorption of the modifier
molecules on the MWCNT surface. Average diameters of the unmodified
and modified MWCNTs that were estimated from the TEM micrographs are
shown in Table 1. SEM
and TEM observations suggest that the TOPy and TDPy molecules are adsorbed on the MWCNT surface to a thickness
of ca. 1.5–2 nm, and this subsequently results in debundling
of the MWCNT agglomerates. The TOPy and TDPy molecules interact with the MWCNT surface through π–π
interactions and these adsorbed molecules weaken the intertube attractive
forces resulting in the debundling of MWCNTs.

2.2 Interaction between Alkylated Pyrene Modifier
Molecules and MWCNTs
The performance of CNT-based nanocomposites
and suspensions relies strongly on the interaction of CNTs with their
environment, which is in turn influenced by the chemical structure
and nature of the dispersion medium and the presence of other modifier
molecules. There can be various noncovalent interactions that act
between CNTs and molecular, macromolecular, or ionic species that
constitute the dispersion medium.33 The
highly aromatic nature of the pyrenyl group leads to a strong π–π
interaction with the sidewalls of CNTs.45 Various techniques, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and NMR can be used to probe
the π–π interaction between the pyrene derivative
molecules and CNTs.27 A detailed assessment
of interactions between the modifier molecules and MWCNTs would bring
interesting insights into the understanding of MWCNT dispersions in
the oil phase of emulsions that have been investigated here. FTIR
spectra, Raman spectra, and fluorescence emission spectra of unmodified
and modified MWCNTs were analyzed to assess the interaction between
the modifier molecules and MWCNTs.

2.2.1 FTIR
Spectroscopic Measurements
FTIR spectra of unmodified, 1:1 TOPy-, and 1:1 TDPy-modified MWCNTs in the full
wavelength range is presented
in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. Figure 2a exhibits the FTIR
spectra of TOPy and 1:1 TOPy-modified MWCNTs.
As observed from the FTIR spectrum of TOPy, the peaks
at 721.6 and 830.8 cm–1 are associated with the
C–H wagging vibrations of the pyrenyl group. These two wagging
vibration bands appeared in the TOPy-modified MWCNTs
as well. However, they showed a downshift to 717.8 and 828.3 cm–1. These downshifts of the wagging vibrational peaks
indicate the strong π–π stacking interaction and
the possible hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic rings of TOPy and the MWCNT surface.27,43Figure 2b shows the FTIR spectra of
the unmodified and 1:1 TOPy-modified MWCNTs. Figure 2c illustrates the
downshift of the wagging vibrational bands in TDPy-modified
MWCNTs. The vibrational bands have shown a downshift to 716.3 and
828.5 cm–1, respectively, from 720.6 and 832.5 cm–1 corresponding to TDPy. Figure 2d shows the FTIR spectra of
the unmodified and 1:1 TDPy-modified MWCNTs. Thus, a
shift of the wagging vibrational bands to lower wavenumbers suggests
the strong π–π interaction between the aromatic
rings of the modifier molecules and the MWCNT surface.

MWCNTs; (c) TDPy and 1:1 (w/w) TDPy-modified
MWCNTs; (d) unmodified and 1:1 (w/w) TDPy-modified MWCNTs.

2.2.2 Raman
Spectroscopic Measurements
Figure 3a shows the
Raman spectra of unmodified, TOPy-, and TDPy-modified MWCNTs. The Raman spectrum of the unmodified MWCNTs exhibits
two characteristic peaks: a D-band at ∼1344.2 cm–1 and a G-band centered at ∼1581.6 cm–1.
Raman scattering involves inelastic scattering of light, and the Raman
spectrum depicts the scattered light intensity with respect to the
excitation wavelength. The shape and intensity of the D-band correspond
to the sp3 hybridized carbon atoms,46 which is correlated with the defect concentration or the
measure of disorders in the C–C bonds and the chemical sidewall
functionalization.47 The G-band is attributed
to the tangential C=C bond stretching in an ordered graphitic
structure.48

Figure 3 Raman spectroscopic investigation
of the unmodified and modified
MWCNTs: (a) Raman spectra in the full scan range for unmodified, TOPy-, and TDPy-modified MWCNTs; (b) Raman spectra
in the 1000–2000 cm–1 range, illustrating
the shifts in the D-band and G-band of the modified MWCNTs.

Raman spectra of unmodified and
modified MWCNTs in the range of
1000–2000 cm–1 are shown in Figure 3b to clearly illustrate the
shifts in the characteristic peaks of the modified MWCNTs. The Raman
spectra of the modified MWCNTs exhibit an upward shift in the G-band:
∼1589.5 and ∼1591.4 cm–1 for 1:1 and
1:2 (w/w) TOPy-modified MWCNTs, respectively; ∼1590.5
and ∼1591.7 cm–1 for 1:1 and 1:2 (w/w) TDPy-modified MWCNTs, respectively. Furthermore, the D-band
of the modified MWCNTs also exhibited an upward shift, but relatively
lower when compared to that of the G-band: ∼1346.5 and ∼1348.5
for 1:2 (w/w) TOPy- and TDPy-modified MWCNTs,
respectively.

The D-band and G-band peaks originate due to the
“resonance
phenomenon”, and the peak position could be associated with
the electronic and vibrational densities of state.43 The adsorption of the alkylated pyrene molecules on MWCNTs
may alter the vibrational densities of state and could eventually
affect the vibrational modes of MWCNTs. Furthermore, the tangential
displacement G-mode is also sensitive to the charge that is exchanged
between the CNTs and the adsorbed molecule.49 Hence, the shift in the G-band to a higher wavenumber for the modified
MWCNTs could be due to the π–π interaction between
the adsorbed modifier molecules and MWCNTs. A similar shift to higher
wavelengths in the Raman spectroscopic peaks of pyrene-modified MWCNTs
has been reported earlier.27 Furthermore,
a shift to a higher wavenumber can also arise due to weaker intertube
interactions, suggesting the “de-agglomeration” of MWCNTs
in the presence of the modifier molecules.

The unmodified MWCNTs
exhibit a ID/IG value of ∼1.22, whereas the 1:1 and
1:2 (w/w) TOPy-modified MWCNTs show ∼0.82 and
∼0.98, respectively. For the TDPy-modified MWCNTs,
the ID/IG values
are 0.95 and 0.99, respectively, for 1:1 and 1:2 (w/w) modifications.
An increase in the ID/IG ratio indicates a higher defect fraction in the ordered
graphitic structure.43,50 Furthermore, a reduced ID/IG ratio suggests
an improved debundling of MWCNT agglomerates and an enhanced resonance
process after the exfoliation of MWCNTs.51,52 The persistent decrease in the ID/IG ratio of modified MWCNTs is due to the enhanced
debundling of MWCNTs in the presence of alkylated pyrene molecules.

2.2.3 UV–Visible and Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Measurements
The UV–visible absorption spectra of
unmodified, 1:2 (w/w) TOPy-, and TDPy-modified
MWCNT dispersions in THF along with the absorption spectra of TOPy and TDPy free molecules in THF are shown
in Figure 4. The unmodified
MWCNTs in THF exhibited an absorption maximum at ∼253 nm. The
absorption spectra of both modified MWCNTs were almost identical to
those of the free modifier molecules in THF. This observation implies
that the absorption spectrum is primarily governed by the respective
modifier molecules in the corresponding bulk solution.

Figure 4 UV–visible absorption
spectra of dilute solutions of TOPy and TDPy, and dispersions of unmodified, TOPy-, and TDPy-modified MWCNTs in THF.

Fluorescence spectra of the pyrene monomers in the solution
phase
show significant vibronic bands, and the pyrene derivatives are often
used as fluorescence probes due to their high fluorescence quantum
yield.27,53 The strong fluorescence from the TOPy and TDPy molecules is a marker to demonstrate the interaction
of these molecules with MWCNTs. The fluorescence spectra of TOPy- and TDPy-modified MWCNT dispersions in
THF were recorded using solutions that possessed identical absorbance
at the Soret band maximum (426 nm). Figure 5 exhibits the fluorescence emission spectra
of all materials in THF. Upon excitation, the fluorescence spectra
of the modified MWCNTs show superimposable profiles with respect to
the free TOPy and TDPy molecules in THF.
Although there is no change in the spectroscopic feature for both
modified MWCNTs, a significant quenching in the fluorescence emission
intensity of the modified MWCNTs is observed when compared to the
emission intensity of the modifier molecules alone in THF. However,
there is no significant spectral shifting in the presence of MWCNTs.
Fluorescence quenching by CNTs through energy transfer has been reported
in several publications.27,32,54−59 The fluorescence quenching is attributed to the energy transfer
from the high-energy pyrene singlet which is at the excited state
to the low-energy manifold of CNTs.60 The
residual fluorescence might be derived from the free, nonimmobilized
modifier molecules in the solution.

Figure 5 Fluorescence emission spectra of dilute
solutions of TOPy and TDPy, and dispersions
of unmodified, TOPy-, and TDPy-modified
MWCNTs in THF. All samples, except
for the dispersions of unmodified MWCNTs, possessed a matching absorption
at 426 nm. This is a qualitative trend of the fluorescence emission
intensities and cannot be assumed to be quantitative for comparisons
(λex = 426 nm, excitation and emission slit width
is 2.5 nm).

To further investigate
the interaction between the modifier molecules
and MWCNTs at the molecular level, a set of fluorescence spectroscopy
experiments were run at varied concentrations of MWCNTs in the modifier
solution in THF. Upon excitation, the fluorescence spectra of MWCNTs
again showed superimposable profiles with respect to the free TOPy and TDPy molecules in THF. The addition
of MWCNTs did not give rise to a new spectroscopic feature; however,
there was substantial quenching in the fluorescence emission intensity
in the presence of MWCNTs when compared to the emission intensity
of the modifier molecules alone in THF (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

The fluorescence measurements
strongly suggest a mapping of the
modifier molecules onto the surface of the MWCNTs through π–π
stacking. Thus, the residual fluorescence quenching may presumably
be due to π–π interactions. Since there is no indication
of charge transfer between the modifier molecule and MWCNTs, the fluorescence
quenching could have resulted from an efficient energy transfer from
the pyrene moiety in TOPy and TDPy to the
MWCNTs through vibrational coupling. However, it is also reported
that the observed reduction in the fluorescence intensity cannot be
assumed to be quantitative. Fluorescence quenching could also result
from other factors such as light partitioning between the modifier
molecule and the MWCNTs (hence, a fraction of the photons excites
the CNT scaffold) and scattering of the emitted light due to the presence
of MWCNTs in the dispersion.58,61

Figure 6 illustrates
the schematic of the noncovalent modification of MWCNTs using the
alkylated pyrene derivatives, which leads to the debundling of MWCNT
agglomerates. Details of the interaction between the alkylated pyrene
modifier molecules and MWCNTs at the molecular level are indefinite
at the current stage. However, the spectroscopic results suggest that
the physical adsorption of the modifier molecules on the sidewall
of the MWCNTs can be attributed to π–π interactions
and van der Waals interactions.

derivatives on the surface of MWCNTs leading to the debundling of
MWCNT agglomerates (the dimensions of MWCNTs and modifier molecules
are not in scale).

2.3 Modified
MWCNT-Incorporated HCEs
To facilitate the selective dispersion
and localization, MWCNTs were
originally dispersed in the oil blend through ultrasonication. The
oil blend comprises a mixture of hydrocarbon oils and an emulsifier.
The oil blend–MWCNT dispersion was used as the oil phase for
the preparation of the nanotube-incorporated HCE and gradually incorporated
into the salt solution to prepare the emulsion. First, a stable and
homogeneous dispersion of the individualized MWCNTs in the oil blend
is necessary to effectively incorporate MWCNTs into the emulsion matrix.
Even though the modified MWCNTs could provide a much improved dispersion
of debundled MWCNTs in the oil blend, some amount of MWCNTs still
remained in the agglomerated state. This could be due to the very
high concentration of MWCNTs in the oil blend. The amount of modified
MWCNTs in the dispersion ranged between 2.24 and 17.9 mg/mL and was
considerably higher when compared to the other high-concentration
CNT dispersions reported in any organic solvent (∼2 mg/mL).62 Even an extended ultrasonication also failed
to cause any considerable improvement in the dispersion state of MWCNTs.
The remaining MWCNT agglomerates were more noticeable in dispersions
that had a higher loading of MWCNTs. The MWCNT–oil blend dispersions
of unmodified and modified MWCNTs with varying concentrations of MWCNTs
were used for preparing the nanotube-incorporated HCEs.

2.3.1 Emulsion Microstructure
Laser scanning
confocal microscopy was used to obtain differential interference contrast
(DIC) images and fluorescence images of emulsions. Figure 7 illustrates the fluorescence
images and overlapped DIC-fluorescence images for 0.5NT and 1NT emulsions
incorporated with modified MWCNTs when excited with a laser at 488
nm. Emulsions incorporated with modified MWCNTs exhibit fluorescence,
which arises from the adsorbed alkylated pyrene molecules excited
by the laser (Figure 7a–h). As observed from micrographs, the fluorescence phenomenon
is from the thin layer around the dispersed droplets, which suggests
that a major fraction of the MWCNTs is localized and confined to the
continuous phase of HCEs (Figure 7a–h). It should also be noted that there is
a possibility that some fraction of the adsorbed modifier molecules
from the modified MWCNTs gets dissolved in the oil blend. This might
also contribute to the total fluorescence from the continuous phase.

Figure 7 Laser
scanning confocal micrographs of emulsions incorporated with
modified MWCNTs, which show fluorescence images (right) and overlapped
DIC-fluorescence images (left) for 0.5NT and 1NT emulsions: (a–d)
emulsions incorporated with 1:1 and 1:2 (w/w) TOPy-modified
MWCNTs; (e–h) emulsions incorporated with 1:1 and 1:2 (w/w) TDPy-modified MWCNTs.

The modified MWCNTs allow better dispersion of the individualized
MWCNTs, as well as allow them to be localized in the continuous phase
of the emulsion so that the MWCNT network can be achieved within the
HCE. Laser scanning confocal microscopic analyses qualitatively suggest
that the majority of MWCNTs remain selectively dispersed in the continuous
phase of the emulsion; however, some fraction of MWCNTs remained in
the agglomerated state in the emulsion matrix. Furthermore, it needs
to be investigated whether the amount of MWCNTs dispersed in the HCE
is sufficient to alter any emulsion characteristics by forming an
efficient three-dimensional network within the HCE. On the other hand,
it is not possible to incorporate a very high amount of MWCNTs into
the oil phase as any concentration beyond ∼5 wt % in the oil
phase hardly produces stable emulsions or cannot accommodate the same,
very high, aqueous phase volume fraction, even when some emulsions
are formed.

2.3.2 Dispersion State of the
MWCNTs in the Emulsion:
Microscale and Nanoscale Analyses
2.3.2.1 Average
Agglomerate Size of the MWCNTs
in the Emulsion: Influence of Noncovalent Modification
Microscopic
analyses were carried out to assess the role of the noncovalent modifiers
in effectively debundling the agglomerates of MWCNTs to achieve an
improved dispersion in the emulsion. The size of the MWCNT agglomerates
that remained in the emulsion matrix was determined using confocal
microscopic analysis (Figure 8a–l). It can be seen that the remaining MWCNT agglomerates
are more prominent in emulsions with unmodified MWCNTs (Figure 8a–d), whereas a substantial
improvement is observed in the case of emulsions with modified MWCNTs
(Figure 8e–l).

Figure 8 Laser
scanning confocal micrographs that show the remaining MWCNT
agglomerates in the 0.25NT, 0.5NT, 1NT, and 2NT emulsions incorporated
with unmodified and modified MWCNTs: (a–d) emulsions incorporated
with unmodified MWCNTs; (e–h) emulsions incorporated with 1:2
(w/w) TOPy-modified MWCNTs; and (i–l) emulsions
incorporated with 1:2 (w/w) TDPy-modified MWCNTs.

Around 25–30 micrographs
were analyzed for each emulsion
system, and the data numerically processed to assess the enhancement
of MWCNT dispersion in the corresponding emulsion. Figure 9 demonstrates the variation
in average agglomerate size (Davg) and
the percentage area of agglomerates in the unmodified and 1:2 (w/w)
modified nanotube-incorporated emulsions with different concentrations
of MWCNTs. For the emulsion having 0.25 wt % MWCNTs, Davg is 9.8 μm for the unmodified MWCNTs, whereas
for the TOPy- and TDPy-modified MWCNTs,
it is 6.8 and 6.5 μm, respectively. For the 2 wt % nanotube-incorporated
emulsions, Davg is 12.4 μm for the
unmodified MWCNTs and 10.6 and 10.9 μm, respectively, for the TOPy- and TDPy-modified MWCNTs. Furthermore,
the trend in the calculated area ratios of the agglomerates is consistent
with that of the agglomerate size. For 0.25NT and 2NT emulsions incorporated
with unmodified MWCNTs, the area ratio is 0.55 and 8.8%, respectively.
In contrast, the corresponding area ratios are 0.18 and 5.5% for the
emulsions incorporated with TOPy-modified MWCNTs and
0.21 and 5.1% for the emulsions incorporated with TDPy-modified MWCNTs.

area ratio
of the MWCNT agglomerates that remained in the emulsion matrix for
the emulsions incorporated with unmodified and modified MWCNTs.

The microscale analysis suggests
that the noncovalent surface modification
has effectively improved the dispersion state of the MWCNTs in the
emulsion. This can be envisaged as a result of the effective debundling
of the MWCNTs in the presence of the noncovalent modifier molecules.
Moreover, the rapid re-aggregation of the dispersed MWCNTs might have
been hindered by the adsorbed modifier molecules on the MWCNT surface.
It is also expected that the noncovalent modification facilitates
the localization of the individualized MWCNTs predominantly in the
oil phase mediated via the specific interaction between the alkyl
chain of the organic modifier and the oil phase. At room temperature,
the dispersed aqueous droplets are made of a supersaturated and supercooled
salt solution. Hence, it is crucial that the dispersed MWCNTs stay
in the continuous-oil phase of the emulsion and not migrate to the
oil–water interface, as this may adversely affect the stability
of the emulsion.

2.3.2.2 Dispersion State of
MWCNTs in HCEs: Nanoscale
Microstructural Analysis Using Cryo-FEG-SEM
Cryo-FEG-SEM
analysis was performed to assess the dispersion state of MWCNTs at
the nanoscale level. The dispersion state of various MWCNTs has been
analyzed by considering the 1NT emulsion samples as the representative
emulsions. The emulsion samples were frozen at −190 °C,
and the corresponding SEM images were taken from the fractured surfaces.
The morphologies of the 1NT emulsion incorporated with unmodified
MWCNTs (Figure 10a,b),
the corresponding emulsion incorporated with 1:2 (w/w) TOPy-modified MWCNTs (Figure 10c,d), and the corresponding emulsion incorporated with 1:2
(w/w) TDPy-modified MWCNTs (Figure 10e,f) are shown in the SEM micrographs (Figure 10a–f). The
morphology, as observed from the Cryo-FEG-SEM micrographs, suggests
that it is quite difficult to differentiate between the dispersion
states of different MWCNTs in the corresponding emulsions. The dispersed
MWCNTs in the emulsion matrix can be clearly observed in the micrographs
of fractured surfaces. However, the selective dispersion and localization
of MWCNTs in the oil phase of HCEs cannot be explicitly established
from these micrographs. Hence, the Cryo-FEG-SEM observation of the
fractured surface morphology alone is inadequate to elucidate the
dispersion states of the unmodified and modified MWCNTs in the respective
emulsions.

unmodified
and modified MWCNTs at high and low magnifications: (a, b) 1NT emulsion

with 1:2 (w/w) TOPy-modified MWCNTs; (e, f) 1NT emulsion
incorporated with 1:2 (w/w) TDPy-modified MWCNTs.

3 Conclusions
Two tetra-alkylated pyrene derivatives that can act as effective
noncovalent surface modifiers for MWCNTs were proposed and synthesized.
The tetra-alkylated pyrene molecules were intended to produce a better
dispersion of the individualized MWCNTs, and allow them to be localized
in the continuous-oil phase of the highly concentrated w/o emulsions.
These modifier molecules interact efficiently with the MWCNT surface
through π–π interactions. The adsorption of the
modifier molecules onto the surface of the MWCNTs resulted in the
effective debundling of MWCNT agglomerates due to the weakened force
of attraction between the nanotubes. Both the G-band shift in Raman
spectroscopic analysis and the downshift of wagging vibrational bands
in FTIR analysis, which were exhibited by the modified MWCNTs, along
with the fluorescence quenching of the alkylated pyrene molecules
in the presence of the MWCNTs all confirm the π–π
interaction between the tetra-alkylated pyrene molecules and MWCNTs.

The modified MWCNTs were then incorporated into HCEs, and the influence
of the noncovalent surface modification on the MWCNT dispersion in
emulsions was investigated. The fluorescence localization from the
thin layer around the dispersed droplets, in emulsions incorporated
with modified MWCNTs, suggested that the major fraction of the incorporated
MWCNTs are localized and confined to the continuous-oil phase of HCEs.
However, the selective dispersion and localization of MWCNTs in the
oil phase of HCEs was not unambiguously concluded from the Cryo-FEG-SEM
micrographs. Developing an efficient protocol to investigate the state
of dispersion of MWCNTs in these emulsions is important and extremely
challenging. Moreover, a comparatively minor fraction of MWCNTs remained
in the agglomerated state in the emulsion, even after the noncovalent
modification. However, there was a substantial reduction in the average
size and the area ratio of the MWCNT agglomerates that remained in
the emulsion matrix in these emulsions when compared to the corresponding
emulsions composed of unmodified MWCNTs. However, there was no significant
difference in the average agglomerate sizes of modified MWCNTs between
the two modifiers. The improved dispersion state of MWCNTs in the
emulsion can be envisaged as a result of the effective debundling
in the presence of the noncovalent modifier molecules and the impeded
rapid re-aggregation of the dispersed MWCNTs by the adsorbed modifier
molecules.

(DCM) and petroleum benzine, were procured from Merck Ltd., and anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diisopropylamine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.1.2 Emulsion Preparation
All of the
constituents of the oil phase of the emulsion, such as the methylated
canola oil, Exxol D130 (paraffinic oil), and emulsifier (polyisobutylene
succinic anhydride (PIBSA)–diethanolamine derivative surfactant)
were supplied by Orica Australia Pty. Ltd. The emulsifier is based
on alkanolamine derivatives of PIBSA, which is prepared by reacting
PIBSA and diethanolamine in 1:1 M ratio. Further details of the PIBSA-derivative
emulsifier can be found elsewhere.16 The
constituents of the aqueous phase, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium
chloride, and other trace additives, were procured from Sigma-Aldrich.
Deionized water was used to prepare the aqueous phase, and the trace
additives were added to adjust the pH of the salt solution. MWCNTs
were procured from Nanocyl S.A., Belgium (grade: NC 3100; Davg = 9.5 nm, L = 1.5 μm
and purity greater than 95% as per manufacturer).

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 General Methods
Thin-layer chromatography
was performed using silica gel plates (Merck) that were precoated
with a fluorescent indicator with visualization by ultraviolet light.
Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (60–120 mesh). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker
Avance-400 spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz and 13C:
100 MHz). The chemical shifts are recorded in ppm using the solvent
as an internal standard: chloroform-d at 7.24 and
77.23 ppm for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively.
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded using a Q-TOF analyzer
in the positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mode.

TOPy has previously been synthesized.40,63 The synthesis protocol of TDPy was adapted from that
of TOPy. Tetrabromopyrene was functionalized with 1-octyne
and 1-dodecyne under Sonogashira conditions to obtain TOPy and TDPy, respectively. Synthesis protocols for TOPy and TDPy are detailed below:

1,3,6,8-Tetrabromopyrene
(2 g, 3.86 mmol), CuI (42 mg, 0.22 mmol),
and (Pd(PPh3)2Cl2) (142 mg, 0.202
mmol) were added to a degassed solution of anhydrous THF (40 mL) and
diisopropylamine (40 mL) in a round-bottomed flask under N2. The mixture was again degassed and an excess of 1-octyne (4 mL,
27.11 mmol, 7 equiv) was added. The mixture was degassed once again
and stirred at 80 °C under N2 for 24 h. The reaction
mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature and, subsequently,
filtered over celite and washed with 250 mL of DCM. The solvent was
then removed, and the residue was dried under vacuum. The crude product
was purified by column chromatography with a solvent that comprised
90% of petroleum benzine and 10% of DCM. Furthermore, precipitation
from DCM–diethyl ether yielded a bright yellow powder of TOPy (1.36 g, 55.6% yield) (Scheme 1).

4.3 Surface
Modification of MWCNTs Using Alkylated
Pyrene Molecules
Both TOPy and TDPy demonstrated very high solubility in common organic solvents, such
as hexane, toluene, chloroform, DCM, and THF. MWCNTs were solubilized
in THF, and subsequently, the TOPy- and TDPy-functionalized MWCNTs were prepared. MWCNT/modifier ratios of 1:1
and 1:2 (w/w) were employed for surface modification of MWCNTs. MWCNTs
were initially dispersed in THF by ultrasonication (Ultrasonic Processor
750W, Sonics & Materials Inc.) for 10 min. The modifier solution
in THF was then slowly added to the dispersion of MWCNTs followed
by ultrasonication for another 30 min. Subsequently, the resultant
dispersion of MWCNTs–modifier molecules in THF was continuously
stirred at room temperature to evaporate the solvent and obtain the
dry powder of modified MWCNTs. The resultant mixture of MWCNTs–modifier
molecules was then vacuum-dried in an oven at 40 °C for 24 h
to remove the traces of THF.

4.4 Preparation of MWCNT-Incorporated
HCEs
A highly concentrated w/o emulsion system with ϕ
= 93.5 wt
% was chosen for the current study. The dispersed phase of the emulsion
comprises a supersaturated inorganic salt solution, in which water
constitutes 55 wt % and the remaining materials are ammonium sulfate
and ammonium chloride salts along with some trace additives. The mixture
of a PIBSA-derivative emulsifier in the blend of canola oil and Exxol
D130 oil constitutes the continuous phase. A detailed description
of the emulsion composition can be found elsewhere.16

A high-torque Caframo BDC 1850 mixer along with a
high-shear Jiffy impeller (Jiffy Mixer LM, 32 mm diameter) was used
to prepare the HCE samples. MWCNTs were initially dispersed in the
oil blend, and the resulting oil blend–MWCNT dispersion was
gradually incorporated into the aqueous salt solution to prepare the
nanotube-incorporated HCEs. The concentration of MWCNTs in the oil
blend was varied from 0.25 to 2 wt %, which corresponds to 0.016–0.13
wt % of the total emulsion. The aqueous phase composition and the
aqueous-to-oil phase ratio were kept unaltered for all HCE samples.
The detailed procedure for the preparation of the nanotube-incorporated
HCEs could be found elsewhere.16,64 It is to be noted that
HCEs under study are stabilized by a relatively large amount of emulsifier,
and the MWCNTs dispersed in the oil blend do not show any surfactant-like
behavior. To obtain the emulsions with identical droplet size and
polydispersity, emulsions with varying MWCNT concentrations were subjected
to different mixing times. The targeted average droplet size of 5
μm was reached with 6–15 min of refining, depending on
the level of MWCNT loading. The compositions of different emulsion
samples along with their sample codes are presented in Table 2.

4.5 Characterization
Techniques
4.5.1 UV–Visible Spectroscopic Analysis
UV–visible spectroscopic measurements were performed on
dispersions of pristine and modified MWCNTs in THF using a Shimadzu
Varian Cary 100 Bio UV–vis spectrometer. Around 1 mg of unmodified/modified
MWCNTs was ultrasonicated in 20 mL of THF with a bath-type sonicator
(PCi Analytics, India, frequency 20 kHz) for 20 min.

4.5.2 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescent
spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer.
Measurements were carried out on the solutions of noncovalent modifier
molecules and dispersions of unmodified and modified MWCNTs in THF.
The excitation wavelength was set at 426 nm.

4.5.3 Transmission
Electron Microscopic (TEM)
Analysis
TEM micrographs of the unmodified and modified MWCNTs
were captured using a JEOL JEM-2100 F (Japan) field-emission electron
microscope. To prepare samples for TEM investigation, around 1 mg
of unmodified/modified MWCNTs was ultrasonicated in 20 mL of THF with
a bath-type sonicator (PCi Analytics, 20 Hz) for 20 min. After ultrasonication,
the supernatant was carefully pipetted, and a drop of the dispersion
was placed on the TEM grid and it was dried under vacuum.

4.5.4 Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) Analysis
SEM analyses
on unmodified and modified MWCNTs were performed using
FEG-SEM (JSM-7600F, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. A
MWCNT dispersion in THF was drop-cast on a silicon wafer, after which
the wafer was vacuum-dried. The wafer surface was gold-sputtered prior
to imaging.

4.5.5 Raman Spectroscopic Analysis
Raman
spectroscopic investigations of unmodified and modified MWCNTs were
carried out on a HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon,
France). The Raman spectra were obtained in the scanning range of
1000–3000 cm–1 with an incident laser excitation
wavelength of 532 nm.

4.5.6 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopic
(FTIR) Analysis
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic
(FTIR) analysis of the unmodified and modified MWCNTs was carried
out using a Vertex 80 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The FTIR
spectra were recorded over the scanning range of 400–4000 cm–1 at room temperature.

4.5.7 Laser
Scanning Confocal Microscopic Analysis
Laser scanning confocal
microscopic analyses were carried out on
an Olympus IX 81 confocal laser scanning microscope. Laser scanning
confocal micrographs were captured using a thin layer of the emulsion
that was retained between glass slides. The sample preparation for
the confocal microscopic investigation could be found elsewhere.64 The droplet size and droplet-size distribution
of the emulsion samples were estimated from the confocal micrographs
using the ImageJ software.

4.5.8 Cryo-FEG-SEM Analysis
The dispersion
state of MWCNTs in HCEs was examined using a Cryo-FEG-SEM facility:
JSM-7600F FEG-SEM with a PP3000T cryo-preparation system, Japan. The
Cryo-FEG-SEM micrographs were captured from the fractured surfaces
under 5 kV acceleration voltage. The sample preparation for the Cryo-FEG-SEM
analysis can be found elsewhere.64
