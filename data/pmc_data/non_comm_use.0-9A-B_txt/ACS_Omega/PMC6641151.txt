We present a coarse-grained (CG)
model of a rodlike higher-order
quadruplex with explicit monovalent salts, which was developed from
radial distribution functions of an underlying reference atomistic
molecular dynamics simulation using inverse Monte Carlo technique.
This work improves our previous CG model and extends its applicability
beyond the minimal salt conditions, allowing its use at variable ionic
strengths. The strategies necessary for the model development are
clearly explained and discussed. The effects of the number of stacked
quadruplexes and varied salt concentration on the elasticity of the
rodlike higher-order quadruplex structures are analyzed. The CG model
reproduces the deformations of the terminal parts in agreement with
experimental observations without introducing any special parameters
for terminal beads and reveals slight differences in the rise and
twist of the G-quartet arrangement along the studied biopolymer. The
conclusions of our study can be generalized for other G-quartet-based
structures.

1 Introduction
It
is believed that the most common form of DNA in human cells
is the B-DNA double helix. However, it is also known that DNA can
adopt a variety of alternative conformations. One type of them, commonly
named G-quadruplex, can be found at the human telomeric chromosomal
ends.1−4 This guanine-rich chromosomal part consists of large amounts of
repetitive single TTAGGG sequences, preventing chromosome fusion and
protecting the chromosome from damage.5,6 Throughout
the life-long cell division process, the telomeric ends are progressively
reduced to a length that will induce apoptosis regulated cell death.
Reverse phenomena occur when the enzyme telomerase extends the telomeric
parts and prolongs the lifetime of cells.
The possibility of inhibiting the telomerase enzyme activity by folding
the telomeric sequence into a G-quadruplex was experimentally observed
in vitro in 2002 by Neidle and Parkinson.7 Telomeric structures are already considered as potential targets
in anticancer drug design8,9 because an increase
in the regulation of telomerase is associated with cancer cells.10 Indications for in vivo occurrence of G-quadruplexes
have been given by several groups,11−13 and Biffi et al. have
recently quantitatively visualized them in human cells.14 Apart from the chromosomal terminal part, the
human genome contains a high number of sequences that can potentially
form G-quadruplexes.15,16 All together, the formation of
G-quadruplexes is believed to have a wide range of biological implications,
from cell-cycle regulation,14,17,18 through G4 motifs that are associated with different diseases,19,20 to multifunctional therapeutic applications as an aptamer or sensor.21−24 A recent review of Bochman et al.25 focuses
on the emerging importance related to the characteristics of G-quadruplex
structures and the possible influence on genomic stability and cellular
processes such as transcription or replication.

In this noncanonical
DNA structure, four guanine bases form planar
G-quartets by connecting through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Two or
more of these G-quartets are stacked together by π–π
interactions, while being stabilized by monovalent cations occupying
the cavity between these G-quartets.26−28 Depending on the physical
conditions, different G-quadruplex topologies can be adopted, varying
in the orientation of their backbone chains: the parallel,29 antiparallel,30 or
hybrid31 form. Moreover, they can be formed
within a single sequence of DNA (intramolecular) or by multiple DNA
strands (intermolecular).32,33 In principle, a single
guanine-rich DNA sequence (or sequences) can form higher-order structures
based on multiple G-quadruplex blocks that interact with each other
in a variety of ways. Different experimental methods have already
been used to confirm the formation of compact higher-order quadruplex
structures.34−39 In particular concerning a single continuous DNA sequence, there
are two suggestions for the structure. One of them, the beads-on-a-string
model40−42 assumes interconnected G-quadruplexes of different
topologies that do not interact with each other, whereas the second,
rodlike higher-order, model is a more compact structure made of stacked
quadruplex units.43−46 However, although the monomeric telomeric quadruplexes are well-characterized,
very little is known about the structure and stability of “higher-order
quadruplexes”.

Besides generating an interest for their
biological role, long
G-rich sequences have been attracting considerable attention because
of their diverse applications in nanotechnology.47−51 Indeed, continuous quadruplex-based biopolymers consisting of a
great number of stacked G-quartets, which are often called G-wires,
have various potential applications: they are found potentially useful
in molecular nanoelectronics52,53 or effective separation
and transportation of cations.54 Their
properties such as thermal and mechanical stabilities55 have been experimentally examined. In addition, it is known
that electron transport in G-wires occurs along the stacked G-quartet
when the unperturbed structure is first thermally activated.56 However, a proper model to uncover the dynamics,
elastic properties, or potential effects in physiological conditions
does not exist yet.

Molecular modeling and simulation methods
have been widely used
for a deeper understanding of the properties of the G-quadruplex molecule,57−59 yet many of these methods such as the atomistic molecular dynamics
(MD) cannot be applied to higher-order structures because of their
large system sizes. It is, therefore, necessary to reduce the computationally
expensive details in a model by applying coarse-graining. Development
of coarse-grained (CG) models is a very actively developing area of
research, and in our previous study,60 we
already presented a one-bead-per-nucleotide CG model of the human
telomeric quadruplex. This model, which was developed from radial
distribution functions (RDFs) of the 2HY9 hybrid system31 of the atomistic simulation, could be further
applied on higher-order quadruplexes to simulate a large and complex
system beyond what is currently feasible in using all-atom (AA) simulations.
Because of the relatively low ionic strength in the minimal salt conditions
used in our previous CG study, we were not able to investigate the
structural stability or any other effects due to varied or high salt
concentrations. This work extends and improves our previous model.
Specifically, we have focused on exploring in detail how the stiffness
of the rodlike higher-order quadruplex structure varies both with
the salt concentration and with the number of G-quartets that it contains
and how the elasticity of long rodlike quadruplex compares with that
in a classical duplex DNA.

2 Methods
2.1 Coarse-Graining
through Inverse Monte Carlo
Method
The idea of systematic structure-based coarse-graining
is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom by uniting atoms into
the so-called beads or grains and reconstructing effective pair potentials
for a CG model from the RDFs of a reference system. Therefore, the
approach requires full atomistic simulations of the system that is
supposed to be coarse-grained. A detailed atomistic simulation provides
necessary structural properties: RDFs between CG sites and intramolecular
distributions of the bond lengths, angles, and torsional angles, which
will be consequently used to build a set of CG-level effective potentials
that are able to model the system at longer time and bigger size scales.

Here, we briefly recapitulate the inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) method.61 Let us assume that all interaction potentials
in a CG system are given in a tabulated form, in the same way as the
reference RDFs, so the discretized Hamiltonian (potential energy)
can be presented as 1  where Vα is the value of a pair potential for the fragment
α of the
distance (or angle) grid and Sα(r) is the number of particles within distance inside of
the α fragment. If the number of grid points that counts all
the interactions in the CG system equals M, then
α = 1, ..., M. For intermolecular interactions,
the canonical average ⟨Sα⟩ is proportional to RDF by 2  where for intramolecular interactions, ⟨Sα⟩ is a histogram of the distribution
of the corresponding bond or angle. If Vα is known, the canonical average can be computed from the standard
MD or Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. However, here we have an inverse
problem where the actual CG pair potentials are unknown, and we would
like to generate them from the known distributions (which can be obtained
from AA simulations).

For small changes in canonical averages
⟨Sα⟩ caused by small
changes in the pair potential Vα, one can write 3  The canonical
average of the arbitrary property
from statistical mechanics is expressed as 4  where Z is the partition
function, T is the temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Therefore, the Jacobian ∂⟨Sα⟩/∂Vβ in eq 3, after the substitution of eq 4, is given by61 5  The set of eqs 3 and 5 allows one to solve the
inverse problem iteratively. We start the first iteration i = 0 from a trial potential, which can be the potential
of mean force (PMF) 6  or just zero Vα(0) = 0. Then
we run the MD or MC simulation, which provides canonical averages
⟨Sα⟩(0)and the cross correlation terms ⟨SαSβ⟩(0). The differences
between the computed and reference values Δ⟨Sα⟩(0) = ⟨Sα⟩(0) – ⟨Sα⟩ref are substituted
into the system of linear eq 3 that returns the correction to the potential ΔVα(0). Note that we neglect the second-order term of O(ΔV2) in eq 3. To keep the changes in RDFs and
the computed potential small and keep the linear regime in eq 3, we multiply the change
in RDF and potential ΔVα(i) by the factor λ, where 0 < λ
< 1, thus updating the potential at each iteration according to
the equation 7  In the computation, the factor λ is
chosen empirically, so that, on the one hand, it provides a linear
regime in eq 3, and thus
the convergence of the iterative process, and on the other hand, it
is not too small to make the iterative process fast enough. The whole
procedure is repeated until convergence is reached and the computed
distribution functions become indistinguishable from those of the
reference system after reaching a required threshold value.

The above-described IMC method, known also as the Newton inversion,62 was recently implemented into a software package
MagiC63 and can be used for the coarse-graining
purpose of any desirable system for which the RDFs are computable
or measurable.

2.2 Reference Atomistic MD
Simulation
The full-parallel human telomeric quadruplex crystal
structure, the
22-mer d[AG3(T2AG3)3]
sequence (PDB code 1KF1(29)), was used as the building block to
construct the higher-order quadruplex. This quadruplex contains three
G-quartets in a full-parallel arrangement and three propeller TTA
loops on the side of the guanine core which link together the bottom
and upper G-quartets. The reference molecule consists of six 1KF1 quadruplex units
stacked on each other while directly linked by additional TTA loops,
as schematically shown in Figure 1a,b. The final rodlike higher-order quadruplex consists
of a single DNA strand of the 142-mer d[A(G3T2A)23G3] sequence. Both the rise and twist angles
between two quadruplex blocks were extracted from the original crystal
structure analysis of two consecutive stacked quadruplexes,29 corresponding to 3.4 Å rise and 30°
twist.26 The negative net charge of the
nucleic acid was neutralized with K+ cations, whereas 17
of them were consecutively placed inside of the electronegative channel
along the axis of the G-quartets, in the same manner as the two cations
positioned in the single 1KF1 block. The final higher-order quadruplex system was
initially centered in a cubic periodic box with a side length of 90
Å and filled with 22 292 TIP4Pew water molecules64 under 150 mM KCl salt concentration using the
Joung and Cheatham parameters for the ions.65 The salt concentration used corresponds to the physiological concentration,
and it also provides a proper sampling of the ions. The choice of
the water and ion models is based on our previous study, in which
we compared different combinations of ion and water models.66

mark bends (intramolecular interactions).

The atomistic MD simulation was run using the GROMACS software,67−69 whereas the ParmBSC070 version of the
Amber parm99 force field was used for the higher-order quadruplex.
In the beginning, the system was
equilibrated under NVT conditions at 298 K, using 1 fs integration
time step, through repeated 100 ps MD simulations with fixed DNA and
counter ions followed by another 100 ps where the constraints on the
counter ions were removed; several energy minimizations and a 25 ps
MD simulation with restrained DNA (the restraints were slowly decreased
from 500 kcal to zero); and a 100 ps MD simulation without restraints.
As the last equilibration step, an additional 200 ps under NPT conditions
using isotropic Parrinello–Rahman barostat71,72 under 2 ps period of pressure fluctuations at equilibrium was performed
to achieve the atmospheric pressure. The production simulation was
run for 1 μs under NVT conditions, while collecting atom coordinates
in the trajectory file every 10 ps. The temperature was controlled
using the velocity rescale thermostat with a stochastic term73 under a 0.1 ps rescaling factor. All hydrogen-containing
bonds were constrained by the LINCS algorithm,74 allowing us to use the 2 fs integration time step during
the main MD simulation. The long-range electrostatic interactions
were treated by the particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation method75 with a 13 Å cutoff. The same cutoff was
applied for the short-range Lennard-Jones interactions. During the
analysis stage, torsion angle calculations were performed using simple
in-house software, inspired by the representation from the Do-x3dna
package.76 All structural visualizations
were obtained using the visual molecular dynamics software.77

To verify the suitability of the simulated
reference system for
coarse-graining purpose, further inspection of the obtained trajectory
was carried out. The root mean square deviations (RMSDs) with respect
to the initial structure based on 1KF1 crystal data were calculated either for
the full higher-order quadruplex or for selected portions of the quadruplex
separately, that is, the core guanine residues and loop residues thymine–thymine–adenine
(TTA), respectively (Figure S1). The RMSD
of the whole structure showed high stability, reaching a plateau value
of around 0.4 nm. Specifically, the guanine residues maintained low
deviation values of 0.2 nm with a minor offset in general, whereas
the loop residues on the other side contributed to the RMSD largely,
around 0.6 nm. The corresponding pairwise RMSD reveals two structural
clusters in the MD simulation (Figure S2), and the transition between them was observed at 200 ns. We can
assume that the trajectory after 200 ns, the second cluster, does
not show any significant conformational or structural changes, whereas
the first cluster will be considered as part of the equilibration.
The calculated root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) with respect
to the initial structure over the last 800 ns of the trajectory, corresponding
to the above-mentioned second cluster, are three times lower for the
core residues than those for the loop residues (Figure S3). Although the guanine residues show constant stable
fluctuation along the entire structure, different TTA loop fluctuations
vary from one loop to another.
For instance, in the 5′ → 3′ direction, although
the first quadruplex block has the smallest fluctuation in loop 3,
the second quadruplex block shows the smallest fluctuation in loop
1.

A very recent X-ray study of all available DNA quadruplexes
revealed
an interesting result that the most frequent topology of the human
telomeric TTA loop corresponds to the native arrangement of the 1KF1 quadruplex crystal
structure.78 This topology arrangement
of the crystal TTA loop involves a certain set of torsion angles for
each residue, which can be reliably quantified and directly compared
with those of AA MD simulations. The set of torsion angles for the
guanine residues from the crystal structure can be obtained and quantified
for comparison. We computed the trajectory of each torsion angle for
the loop first thymine (Th1), second thymine (Th2), adenine (Ad),
and guanine (Gu) from the higher-order quadruplex construct during
our MD simulation. The torsion angle values observed from the trajectory
were subsequently clustered with a resolution of 15°, collected
together through the whole structure into four groups and afterward
normalized by the total number of values in the histogram. This provided
us an angle distribution for each group. To allow a comparison between
the experimental and computational data, the torsional angles for
each group are shown in the compact wheel representation in Figure 2, where the color
intensity reflects the percentage of occupation of a given torsion
angle during the MD simulation. As expected, the Gu group kept all
torsion angles at values remarkably close to those in the crystal
structure. This observation is in agreement with our previous RMSD/RMSF
data and clearly points out that a proper sampling of guanine residues
of the higher-order quadruplex core was performed. The crystal α/γ
torsion angle values for Th1 and partially for Th2 were changed during
our MD simulation in agreement with what was already observed in previous
studies by Fardná et al.79 This
is because of the included force field backbone corrections necessary
for the duplex DNA. The rest of the torsional angle values from TTA
loop parts of the higher-order structure, showing increased RMSD/RMSF
during the MD simulation have kept their torsional angle arrangement
comparable with the crystal data surprisingly close for most of the
torsional angle values, as can be seen from Figure 2. Therefore, our trajectory provides us a
proper sampling of the TTA loop conformations which, overall, reflects
the close arrangement in the crystal structure. In summary, the simulated
structure represents an adequate reference system for further structure-based
coarse-graining.

a torsional angle probability to occur during the MD simulation in

the simulated higher-order quadruplex at the atomistic level. The

for the first thymine residues (Th1), second thymine residues (Th2),
adenine residues (Ad), and guanines residues (Gu) in the 5′
→ 3′ direction. The white circle cluster corresponds
to the angle values that never occurred.

2.3 Structure and Topology of the CG Model
The obtained atomistic trajectory has been mapped onto a simpler
CG representation to define the structure to develop a CG model. We
have chosen the one-bead-per-nucleotide representation (see Figure 1), which has been
already used in our previous work60 The
bead positions are calculated as the center of mass of all included
atoms with a total charge of the group of these atoms. As shown in Figure 1, the CG representation
of the higher-order quadruplex structure consists of two bead types,
guanine nucleotide bead (G) and loop bead (L), representing both adenine
and thymine nucleotides. The final CG model includes three additional
bead types, channel potassium bead (KC), bulk potassium bead (K),
and chloride bead (CL), representing the explicit ion model. The reason
to distinguish the channel potassium from the bulk potassium in the
CG model was due to their different behaviors. Although the channel
potassium remains stable between G-quartets, interacting exclusively
with the guanines and contributing to the stabilization of the quadruplex
core, the uniformly diffused bulk potassium can interact with different
sites of DNA through solvent-mediated or direct contacts.80−82 Expectedly, the RDFs of these two potassium bead types show significantly
different profiles. Although the water molecules have been treated
explicitly in AA MD simulations, they are not present in the CG trajectory
because their effect is implicitly included in the solvent-mediated
CG pair potentials.

The creation of the CG representation of
the higher-order structure requires us to define the interaction topology
between different beads, which includes long-range (intermolecular)
and short-range (intramolecular) interactions. The presented CG model
consists of five different bead types [G, L, KC, K, CL], leading to
15 intermolecular combinations. However, because the reference system
contains only one molecule with structural information, some of the
CG intermolecular interactions between the beads of the quadruplex
can be avoided because a proper conformation of this molecule can
be fully provided by intramolecular interactions (stretches and bends).
The final topology of the presented CG system consists of 10 combinations
between different beads, viz., the G–K, G–CL, L–K,
L–CL, KC–K, KC–CL, K–K, K–CL, CL–CL,
and KC–L combinations. In addition to the nine intermolecular
interactions, we have included the L–CL pair into this list
because of the reason discussed in the next section. Furthermore,
five stretches and six bends between beads are introduced to maintain
the structural conformation of the higher-order CG structure. The
similar set of intramolecular interactions has already been used and
tested in our previous work.60 Specifically,
intramolecular bonded interactions include the G–G stretch
between two consecutive G beads on a chain and the stretch of G beads
between two blocks, the G–G stretch of adjacent bases within
each G-quartet, the G–KC stretch of the G bead and the nearest
channel potassium, the KC–KC stretch between the two nearest
channel potassium ions, the G–L stretch of G and L beads on
the DNA chain, and the L–L stretch of the L beads on chain.
And for bends, the interactions include the G–G–G bend
along the chain, the G–G–G bend of the two G-quartets,
and the G–G–L, L–L–G, L–L–L
bends along the DNA chain.
For an overview on the interactions within the CG model, see Figure 1c.

The reference
CG trajectory was used to calculate the distributions
between the beads for the combinations described in the previous paragraph
(10 intermolecular and 11 intramolecular of which 6 are stretching
terms and 5 are bending terms). The intramolecular distributions were
not accounted for into the final intermolecular RDFs; thus, their
contributions were excluded. Note that the specific bead distances
and angle distributions define the CG intramolecular stretching and
bending between the beads, whereas the RDFs yield long-range intermolecular
interactions (cutoff 30 Å). To obtain the best possible reference
set of distributions, we first compared different 200 ns portions
of the mapped atomistic trajectory for every distribution separately
(Figure S4), which would reveal any changes
in a certain distribution profile. The comparison shows that in some
cases, the first portion (0–200 ns) did slightly differ from
the rest of them. Therefore, we excluded the first 200 ns part of
the trajectory, which was already considered as a part of the equilibration
in the section above, from the calculation of the final reference
distribution. The final set of obtained reference RDFs and distributions
is shown in Figure 3 (red curve).

Figure 3 RDFs (10) calculated from the CG reference atomistic trajectory
(800 ns) as well as the distance (6) and angle (5) distributions,
represented by the red curve. Each plot additionally shows the bead
distribution from the very last iteration (black dotted curve) of
the IMC method and developed CG potential (navy blue curve).

2.4 Development
of the Effective Potentials
The IMC procedure was carried
out using the software package MagiC,63 and after 80 iteration steps in total, satisfactory
convergence was achieved for the CG model. We began with zero potential
for intermolecular interactions and the PMF for intramolecular interactions
in the first iteration. For each subsequent iteration, the differences
between the old distributions and the new distributions from the MC
simulation were used to calculate the potential corrections (see eqs 3 and 5). The iteration step represents a conventional MC simulation with
the current set of the potentials Vα(i). A description of the parameters
used can be found in Table S1, and the
total deviation of the reference and the computed distribution functions
of selected iterations throughout the iterative process can be found
in Figure S5, demonstrating the convergence
of the procedure.
The final set of pair potentials for our CG model of the higher-order
quadruplex is shown in Figure 3 (blue curve), which also includes the reference distribution
functions and the distribution functions calculated from the MC simulation.
The final potential set was able to reproduce the original distribution
functions well. A comparison of the reference and obtained distribution
shows a complete agreement for almost every plot, whereas the rest
of them are nearly identical.

We wish to specifically address
the importance of the KC–L interaction potential, which was
not included in the initial set of nonbonded potentials composed only
of intermolecular pairs of CG beads, including all DNA–ion
and ion–ion pairs and resulting in nine interactions. CG simulations
carried out with this set of effective potentials resulted in loops
flipping into the internal G-quartet space, which was observed occasionally,
as shown in Figure S6. To prevent this,
an additional interaction between channel ions (KC) and L-sites of
DNA was introduced, and it was calculated by the IMC method requiring
reproduction of the KC–L RDF obtained in the atomistic simulation.
Other potentials were fixed during the latter fitting, which allowed
us to extend the used set of the CG potentials without repetition
of the whole iterative process from the beginning.

After obtaining
the final set of the effective CG potentials from
the inverse procedure, additional treatment of the potentials was
performed to prepare them for CG MD simulations. More specifically,
the potentials were smoothened, soft harmonic walls were added for
all intramolecular potentials just outside of the region where they
were defined, and all intermolecular potentials were extended by repulsive
quadratic terms at small distances in the core region.

2.5 CG Simulations
All CG simulations
were performed using the GROMACS software.67−69 The stochastic
Langevin dynamics (SD) integrator83 was
used for two separated groups of beads (DNA quadruplex with channel
potassium beads and the group of K with CL beads). We have also tested
a few other thermostats (Nose, Berendsen) but found that only the
thermostat with a stochastic temperature coupling (Langevin dynamics)
was able to maintain a proper temperature coupling between the K or
CL beads and the higher-order quadruplex structure at large scales.
This can be attributed to the local treatment of the particles in
the Langevin thermostat, which becomes crucial in a CG system with
an implicit solvent and large distances between beads. With “global”
thermostats, counting temperature, and velocity scaling applied uniformly
for the whole system, we observed a rapid aggregation of K and CL
beads (clusters) accompanied by increasing acceleration of the DNA
polymer.

In Langevin dynamics, an inverse friction constant of 2 ps was
used in all CG SD simulations, accelerating the simulation time approximately
by a factor of ∼20 and thereby improving the sampling. This
was calculated by the comparison of a diffusion coefficient of ion
beads in the CG SD simulations with the experimental KCl diffusion
coefficient. The CG SD simulations were performed under the NVT conditions
with a stable integration time step of 5 fs (1 μs-long simulations)
while collecting the atom coordinates in the trajectory file every
10 ps. The relative dielectric constant of ε = 80 was chosen
to include the screening effect of water into the CG model. The long-range
electrostatic interactions between the beads were treated using the
PME method75 (order of 5) with a long 90
Å cutoff and grid-spacing of 10 Å. The neighbor list was
updated every five steps.

3 Results
and Discussions
The tabulated CG potentials for the rodlike
higher-order quadruplex
CG model with explicit ions allowed us to construct and simulate a
system much bigger than the one used to obtain the potentials and
to simulate it at varied ionic strengths. In the following subsection 3.1, we explain
our approach to calculating the mechanical and structural properties,
that is, the persistence length of the simulated biopolymer and the
rise and twist between adjacent G-quartets. Then, the impact of increasing
the number of stacked quadruplexes on mechanical and structural properties
is described in the subsection 3.2. And finally, in the subsection 3.3, we show how the rodlike higher-order
quadruplex responds to the changes in ionic environment, while it
is compared with the corresponding elasticity of a duplex DNA and
G-wire structures.

3.1 Persistence Length
The mechanical
stiffness property of a biopolymer, such as DNA, can be quantified
by a parameter called the persistence length (PL). At distances shorter than PL, the polymer behaves like a rigid elastic rod, whereas at much longer
lengths, it can be described as a random coil. The mathematical definition
of PL is the decay length at which correlations
in the direction of the segment normal vectors are lost. For an ideal
wormlike chain model, a time average of the scalar product for the
unit normal vector at an arbitrary position i and
the unit normal vector at another position j of the
polymer (in other words, a time average cosine of the angle that these
two vectors determines) decays exponentially with the distance along
the polymer84 and can be written as 8  where D represents the distance
between positions i and j. Although
in canonical DNA, the segments are defined by successive base pairs,
our noncanonical higher-order quadruplex requires a different approach.
To calculate the persistence length from CG simulations, the individual
segments were defined using G-quartets. Therefore, each segment was
given by the positions of the four guanine beads. The exact definition
of a plane and its normal vector is given by an analytic formula from
three-point coordinates; thus, from a single G-quartet (4G beads),
we are able to extract the four plane normal vectors of all the plane
variations that they form.
Summing up of these four vectors defines after a normalization the
final unit normal vector of the selected G-quartet (segment). The
average angles between the different segments i and j were collected through the whole CG simulation, and at
the end, they were used to calculate PL from the D versus −ln(⟨ni·nj⟩) dependency using the 20-point slope (|i – j| = 20 maximally). To avoid possible
end effects, we excluded three terminal quadruplexes from the segment
correlation statistic by applying the simple condition i, j > 9 (a single quadruplex block consists of
three
G-quartets). PL was calculated additionally
at every 100 ns of the trajectory and was also used to determine the
standard deviation. The first 100 ns of trajectory were excluded from
the standard deviation as well as from the PL calculation and considered as an equilibration. Along the
potassium channel, we defined and collected the rises and twists between
the different G-quartets. The twists were calculated as an orthogonal
projection of one G-quartet plane onto another (determined by the
above-mentioned unit normal vectors) along the potassium channel,
whereas the rises were defined as their distance before the projection.
This provides us the twist and rise distributions of the G-quartets
in the form of a histogram and additionally the twist and rise correlations
through all G-quartets. The sum over the individual rises between
G-quartets along the potassium channel was used to calculate the total
contour length of the simulated higher-order quadruplex systems.

3.2 Polymer Length
Recent experimental
measurements by Donohue and Szalai85 on
higher-order quadruplex structure of varying lengths indicate a variation
in the distance among adjacent G-quartets as the number of G-quartets
is changed. Even if they had analyzed shorter quadruplexes comprising
a maximum of ten G-quartets, thus shorter than those studied in the
present investigation, the trend that they observed varying the length
is possibly of general validity. Therefore, we decided to perform
a series of simulations with a different number of stacked quadruplexes
at bigger scales, at a constant KCl concentration of 10 mM as used
in the above experiment. In Table 1, we report the calculated persistence lengths for
higher-order quadruplexes of different lengths. For the sake of completeness,
we also indicate the box length used in each simulation together with
the number of cations and anions necessary for obtaining the desired
KCl concentration.

a An overview of related system properties
as a function of varied number of stacked quadruplexes (N-1KF1 units).

The box side length for each
system was chosen to provide a minimum
end-to-end distance of 100 Å between the periodic mirror image
of the fully extended polymer. The smallest system contains 10 quadruplexes,
30 G-quartets, whereas the largest is five times longer. The intermediate-length
polymers differ from each other by five quadruplexes. As shown in Figure 4, the calculated
correlations between the G-quartets and the corresponding persistence
lengths indicate that the length of the polymer does not affect its
elastic properties and the persistence length is kept at around 700
Å for all lengths. This is further confirmed by the dependence
of the total contour length on the system length, which is perfectly
linear. This also implies that the average distance between the G-quartets
is kept constant in the SD MD simulations at different numbers of N-1KF1 quadruplexes. We verified the constant G-quartet distances by calculating
the mean rise and twist distribution between the G-quartets. They
remained unchanged and indistinguishable to each other (data not shown).
Therefore, increasing the number of stacked quadruplexes does not
have an effect on the polymer elasticity if a long cutoff is chosen
for the electrostatic interactions.

3.3 Ionic Strength
The CG models are
particularly valuable to study the mechanical properties of long polymers
and how the environment affects them. Duplex DNA CG models developed
using the same bottom–up approach (IMC61), as in the present investigation, were shown to correctly predict
the mechanical properties. Previous CG simulation results concerning
the dependence of the elasticity on the monovalent ion concentration
were in good agreement with the experimental data.86,87 These results indicate that the adopted CG models can properly reproduce
the elastic properties of biopolyelectrolytes. Therefore, we performed
a series of simulations varying the KCl concentration in the system
while keeping the number of G-quartets constant as shown in Table 2. The variation in
the calculated persistence lengths and in several other properties
with respect to the ionic environment revealed interesting features
about the constructed higher-order quadruplex. By decreasing the amount
of ions, we observed a slight prolongation of the contour length along
the potassium channel and a slight increase in the mean twist and
rise of the G-quartets (Table 2). As expected, the elasticity of the system decreased at
a lower KCl concentration (Figure 5). Interestingly, a comparison with the experimental
data for a duplex DNA system or a duplex DNA CG model, as shown in Figure 6b, shows a much slower
response of the quadruplex system to ionic environment. The final
estimate of the persistence length around 700 Å points out how
much stiffer the rodlike higher-order quadruplex can be in comparison
with duplex DNA (∼500 Å) at a higher salt concentration.
On the other hand, the rodlike higher-order quadruplex is still more
flexible in comparison with the experimental persistence length for
the pure G-wire structure (∼1000 Å).88 Another important difference is observed at low salt concentrations
at which the duplex DNA becomes rigid, whereas the studied quadruplex
structure still preserves its elasticity. The estimation of persistence
length at zero salt concentration differs from our previous estimation.60 However, both are within the error of the experimental
reference data, and their difference is probably mainly due to the
different electrostatic cutoff used in these two simulations. The
origin of this discrepancy is currently under investigation.

c The mean twist and rise between
adjacent G-quartets.

In Figure 6c,d are
shown the mean rise and twist between adjacent G-quartet couples along
the quadruplex as a function of ionic environment; G-quartet couples
are marked from 1 to 74 (the simulated system of CG 25-1KF1 quadruplexes contains
75 G-quartets in total). To the best of our knowledge, an investigation
of the rise and twist along the polymer has not been made before and
the present investigation immediately provides a new insight into
G-quartet organization in higher-order structures. Clearly, both the
position of the G-quartet along the polymer and its close surrounding
impact the value of the rise and twist. In the 5′ →
3′ direction, three types of G-quartet couples can be found
in the studied system: the first and second types are those within
every 1KF1 quadruplex
(linked by three TTA loops), whereas the third type of G-quartet couples
exists between two stacked quadruplexes (linked by a single TTA loop).
Each type of these G-quartet couples can be easily connected with
the observed rows, as shown in Figure 6c,d; the first one from bottom adopted a rise of 3.48
Å and a twist of 26.5°, the second one adopted a rise of
3.44 Å and a twist of 26.9°, and the third one adopted a
rise of 3.33 Å and a twist of 27.2°. Certainly we found
differences in the G-quartet organization, preferring a slightly different
rise and twist patterns, which strongly depend on the position in
the polymer. Additionally in Figure 6c,d we can see that the CG model reflects and confirms
the effect on both the terminal ends, as the rise and twist of the
first and last three quadruplexes exhibit a different arrangement
in comparison with the rest of the structure. Specifically for a parallel
quadruplex structure, it was shown experimentally that G-quartets
closer to the terminal ends experienced buckling and deformation.91,92 This deformation, involving the outermost quadruplexes, explains
the experimental data, mentioned in subsection
3.2, indicating a variation in the G-quartet rise when increasing
the number of Gquadruplexes.85 Note that
the total rise and twist distributions among all G-quartets shown
in Figure 6e,f are
smooth Gaussians and overlap each other at various ionic strengths;
thus, any indication in the rise and twist of G-quartet variation
cannot be detected from here.

4 Conclusions
We constructed a CG model of a rodlike higher-order quadruplex
with explicit monovalent salts, based on a reference AA MD simulation
of six 1KF1 quadruplex
units stacked on each other while directly linked by additional TTA
loops. The effective CG pair potential set for this model was developed
from selected RDFs from a reference AA system using the IMC technique.
The developed model was used to analyze the effect of the number of
stacked quadruplexes and variation in the ionic strength on the structural
and dynamical properties of the higher-order quadruplex. The increase
in the number of stacked quadruplexes, and thus in the length of the
polymer, does not significantly affect its elastic properties, with
the persistence length being about 700 Å. The elasticity of the
system is affected by the ionic strength. At a high salt concentration,
the rodlike higher-order quadruplex is characterized by a higher stiffness
in comparison with duplex DNA. Another important difference is observed
at low salt concentrations, at which the duplex DNA becomes rigid,
whereas the studied quadruplex structure still keeps some elasticity.
The CG model is capable of reproducing the deformation of the terminal
parts observed experimentally without introducing any different type
of beads for terminal parts through the development of effective potentials.
The closer exploration of structural properties along the studied
polymer reveals slight differences in the rise and twist of the G-quartet
organization.

The results given in this study could not be achieved
by the standard
AA MD approach owing to a huge number of atoms, small amount of G-quartets,
and low sampling amenable through AA simulations of a system of such
size. In total, more than 30 μs of CG trajectories were generated
and analyzed. The SD CG simulation accelerates the study and provides
a better sampling of the system through the smoother potential energy
landscape. We believe that the general conclusions arrived here can
be generalized for all G-quartet-based structures because their building
motive remains similar through all possible quadruplex variations.
An understanding of the mechanical behavior and the effect of ionic
strength may contribute to the nanostructure and nanomaterial research
because of the known experimental difficulty in controlling the G-wire
structures. Moreover, the observation of the deformation of the terminal
parts may contribute to potential biological implications of quadruplexes
because it increases the attractiveness for the binding of a wide
range of ligands.
