Hexavalent chromium
is a genotoxic and carcinogenic byproduct of
a number of industrial processes, which is discharged into the environment
in excessive and toxic concentrations worldwide. In this paper, the
synthesis of green iron oxide nanoparticles using extracts of four
novel plant species [Pittosporum undulatum, Melia azedarach, Schinus molle, and Syzygium paniculatum (var. australe)] using a “bottom-up
approach” has been implemented for hexavalent chromium remediation.
Nanoparticle characterizations show that different plant extracts
lead to the formation of nanoparticles with different sizes, agglomeration
tendencies, and shapes but similar amorphous nature and elemental
makeup. Hexavalent chromium removal is linked with the particle size
and monodispersity. Nanoparticles with sizes between 5 and 15 nm from M. azedarach and P. undulatum showed enhanced chromium removal capacities (84.1–96.2%,
respectively) when compared to the agglomerated particles of S. molle and S. paniculatum with sizes between 30 and 100 nm (43.7–58.7%, respectively)
in over 9 h. This study has shown that the reduction of iron salts
with plant extracts is unlikely to generate vast quantities of stable
zero valent iron nanoparticles but rather favor the formation of iron
oxide nanoparticles. In addition, plant extracts with higher antioxidant
concentrations may not produce nanoparticles with morphologies optimal
for pollutant remediation.

Introduction
Chromium is a valuable
resource in a number of different industries,
having essential roles in refractories, alloys, electroplating, pigments,
catalyst generation, and leather tanning, to name a few applications.1 It is most commonly found in the environment
as the trivalent (Cr III) cation Cr3+ or the hexavalent
(Cr VI) oxyanion, that is, HCrO4– and
CrO42–.2 Trivalent
chromium is an essential macronutrient, which aids in the regulation
of lipid, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism; however, overabundance
may lead to erythrocyte membrane disturbances and cause skin irritation.3 Hexavalent chromium is considerably more toxic
than its trivalent counterpart.4 Unlike
Cr(III), it can penetrate the skin and kill cells and/or damage DNA
through the generation of reactive oxygen species. It is genotoxic
and recognized as a human carcinogen (group 1) by the World Health
Organization. In addition, Cr(VI) is considerably mobile in soils
and waterways, increasing its potential for human and widespread ecosystem
exposure.5

More than 1760 industrial
facilities have been listed by the USEPA’s
“Toxic Release Inventory-2003” for releasing chromium
into the environment with a total discharge of approximately 52 600
metric tons.6 For example, in India, it
is estimated that greater than 2000 tons of chromium is released into
the environment annually. Wastewater from some of these regions contains
up to 5000 ppm of chromium, far exceeding the discharge limit of 2
ppm.7

As a consequence of the amounts
of Cr being released into the environment
and the potential environmental impact, a number of different techniques
have been implemented for the removal of Cr(VI) species from the environment.
The environmental remediation of chromium is faced with a plethora
of different factors and conditions, which must be considered, that
is, pH, Cr(VI) concentration, temperature, interfering species in
aqueous environments, absence of oxygen in groundwater, likelihood
of contamination to pose a health risk, time-sensitive remediation
occurrences, and so forth. Considering this, different remediation
technologies may be required in different situations. The benefits
and disadvantages of each technology are compared in Table 1.

Recently, the use of nanoparticles
for the remediation of hexavalent
chromium species has been investigated. Zhou et al.10 used Fe/Ni bimetallic particles to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous
solution in an ultrasound-assisted system across pH 3–9; Albadarin
et al.11 used hydrous cerium oxide nanoparticles
for Cr(VI) adsorption at pH 2; and Valle et al.12 showed Cr(VI) physisorption to K2Mn4O9 nanoparticles at pH 2.

Generating iron nanoparticles
through the reduction of iron salt
precursors with various crude plant extracts has been widely demonstrated
and has been hailed for its environmentally friendly nature and relatively
low cost when compared to alternative methods. However, the reproducibility
of results in terms of nanoparticle properties (i.e., size, shape,
reactivity, monodispersity, oxidation potential, crystallinity, etc.)
presents a challenge. Many different bioactive molecules found within
plant cells (e.g., polyphenols, proteins, reducing sugars, and lipids)
are likely to interact with iron precursors to influence nanoparticle
formation and properties. The application of iron and bimetallic nanoparticles
is vast; however, their use in the environmental remediation of organic
and inorganic pollutants has shown encouraging results.

Wang
et al.13 synthesized iron nanoparticles
with green tea and eucalyptus leaves, which were able to remove 59.7
and 41.4% of nitrate, respectively, from an initial concentration
of 20 mg/L. Luo et al.14 showed that grape
leaf-mediated synthesis of Fe/Pd bimetallic nanoparticles removed
81.7% of orange II dye from solution with an initial concentration
of 50 mg/L in over 12 h. Martínez-Cabanas et al.15 used eucalyptus-generated Fe nanoparticles encapsulated
in a chitosan matrix for the removal of As(V) using column flow-through
experiments, reporting that almost 100% of As(V) from a 100 μg/L– solution was captured or transformed in over 30 h
at a flow rate of 2 mL/min–1.

Current studies
utilizing plant extracts for the synthesis of iron
nanoparticles tend to select plant candidates based on high antioxidant
concentrations;15,16 however, this may not be beneficial
for optimal iron nanoparticle morphologies as iron is highly reactive
and is likely to interact with various phytochemicals in plant extracts
in different manners. To test this, plants were selected based on
their differing antioxidant profiles and interesting phytochemical
makeup, all of which have been linked to antimicrobial and/or medical
applications.17−20

The aim of this study was to obtain water-soluble phytochemical
extracts from the leaves of four different plant species found within
Australia [Pittosporum undulatum, Melia azedarach, Schinus molle, and Syzygium paniculatum (var. australe)] and use these extracts to reduce iron
salt precursors into iron nanoparticles. All plant species used in
this study are novel in terms of iron nanoparticle synthesis and have
diverse and varying phytochemical profiles. Furthermore, their use
for antimicrobials and therapeutics indicate that they have interesting
phytochemical compositions, which may lead to novel interactions between
biological and inorganic species.21−24 The differences in nanoparticle
morphologies and physiochemical properties, along with their capacity
to remove Cr(VI) species from solution, were investigated.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Plant Extracts
In the search for
plant species capable of generating “green” nanoparticles
with optimal morphologies/properties, much of the selection process
has focused on species containing high plant antioxidant concentrations.
Although increasing antioxidant concentrations are often trended with
increasing reducing powers, their ability to instill optimum morphological
nanoparticle features has not been ascertained. From our results,
the antioxidant concentrations for P. undulatum, M. azedarach, S.
molle, and S. paniculatum were 12.6, 9.9, 7.2, and 48.1 mM Trolox (equiv)/g, respectively,
with only S. paniculatum showing statistically
higher concentration. Reducing powers of the same plant extracts were
5.6, 6.0, 4.7, and 7.5 mg ascorbic acid (AA) (equiv)/g, respectively,
indicating that the species with the highest and lowest antioxidant
concentrations also possessed the highest and lowest reducing powers
(Table 2). Antioxidative
effects have been linked with the generation of reductones, which
are free radical chain reaction terminators. Therefore, antioxidant
activity has, in some cases, a relationship with the reductive capacity.25 Phenols are known antioxidants, and therefore,
it is no surprise that phenolic content followed the same trend as
antioxidant concentration. P. undulatum, M. azedarach, S.
molle, and S. paniculatum possessed phenolic concentrations of 1.9, 1.9, 2.3, and 4.0 mg gallic
acid (GA) (equiv)/g with only S. paniculatum showing statistically higher concentration (Table 2).

Reducing sugars, as their name suggests
are reducing agents with
the capacity to transform iron salts to nanoparticles.26P. undulatum and S. mollepossessed the lowest reducing sugar concentrations
(42.9 and 64.3 mg glucose (equiv)/g, respectively) and were not significantly
different from one another. M. azedarach possessed significantly higher reducing sugars than P. undulatum but was not statistically different
from S. molle. S. paniculatum possessed considerably higher concentrations of reducing sugars
than all other plant extracts with 158.4 mg glucose (equiv)/g [>1.5
times that of M. azedarach, which contained
90.9 mg glucose (equiv)/g]. It is interesting to note that although S. paniculatum contained higher reducing sugar and
antioxidant concentrations when compared to the other species, its
reducing powers was not significantly greater than those of P. undulatum and M. azedarach (Table 2).

Iron chelation relates to the ability of plant extract constituents
to bind to iron ions and form complex ring structures called chelates.
Low and high pH compromise the stability of the chelating agents.27 Although the formation of nanoparticles resulted
in highly acidic solutions following mixing of precursors, the original
pH of the plant extract may also alter the chelation capacity. The
pH of plant extracts of P. undulatum, M. azedarach, S.
molle, and S. paniculatum were 5.95, 5.11, 6.10, and 3.87, respectively (Table 2). The iron-chelating capacity
for the aforementioned plant extracts was 2.6, 2.1, 5.8, and 0.3 mg
ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA) (equiv)/g, which shows a pH-dependent
trend, with lower pH resulting in lower chelation capacity. Satué-Gracia
et al.28 showed that the anthocyanin antioxidants,
delphinidin and malvidin, were unable to bind to copper ions under
acidic conditions. S. paniculatum contains
the glycosidases of malvidin and delphinidin (i.e., malvidin and delpinidin
3,5-diglucoside),29 and its extract is
also acidic, and this may explain its low metal chelation capacity.
In addition, the type of phytochemicals present within the plant extract
may react differently to pH or other competing influences. Interestingly, S. molle possessed the lowest antioxidant concentration
but more than twice the iron-chelating capacity of any other extract.
Freeze-dried samples of this extract yielded a saplike substance,
which may not possess high antioxidative properties but may still
bind to the particles. S. molle was
the only sample to possess a sap/resin following the lyophilization
process.

Synthesis of Iron Nanoparticles
The introduction of
iron chloride solution to the plant extract resulted in a color change
from a yellow/brown extract to a jet-black nanoparticle solution instantaneously.
This indicated that iron nanoparticles had been formed. The pH of
the nanoparticle solutions dropped to 1.5 in all cases; however, nanoparticles
were separated from their solution with the aid of dialysis centrifuge
tubes [molecular-weight cutoff 30 000 Da] and freeze-dried
prior to being used in Cr(VI) removal studies. The nanoparticles were
not magnetic and did not settle out of solution under atmospheric
conditions.

Current studies on plant extracts for the synthesis
of nanoparticles tend to select plant candidates based on high antioxidant
concentrations;30−32 however, this may not be beneficial for optimal nanoparticle
morphologies. In the current study, antioxidant concentrations along
with phenolic content and reducing power capacity have shown little
to no statistical differences between P. undulatum, S. molle, and M.
azedarach. However, the morphologies of the nanoparticle
are markedly different (Figure 1). P. undulatum showed a mixed
nanoparticle morphology with the majority of particles between 5 and
10 nm in size. However, a few larger particles with size ranges between
20 and 70 nm are infrequently present (Figure 1). In addition, there are flat plates that
fold into rods with nanometer dimensions. The presence of numerous
phytoactive compounds acting on the iron chloride precursor in different
ways may be responsible for the numerous different nanoparticle morphologies
present. M. azaderach possessed particles
between 5 and 15 nm in size with little variation in the nanoparticle
morphology. S. molle formed chainlike
structures with particles often falling outside of the nanoparticle
size range (>100 nm in all particle dimensions). Nanoparticle structures
generated from S. paniculatum were33 also chainlike in appearance. However, particle
sizes were considerably smaller than that of S. molle (sizes ranging between 30 and 60 nm) (Figures 1 and S1).

If the generation of maximum nanoparticle concentration is
the
only parameter of interest, then high antioxidant concentration and
reducing powers may be beneficial. However, if specific nanoparticle
properties are required, high antioxidant concentration may not be
a major contributing factor in achieving this. Optimal nanoparticle
properties for pollution remediation include particles that are small,
monodisperse, possess no particle–particle attraction, and
do not passivate readily under aerobic and aqueous conditions.33 Our findings, along with other studies that
utilize antioxidant rich green tea extracts to generate iron nanoparticles,
have shown that high antioxidant concentrations lead to particles
that agglomerate and form chainlike structures,34−38 thereby reducing the nanoparticle surface area available
for remediative interactions.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS) and Powder X-ray Diffraction
(XRD)
There is a common misconception that the production
of black iron nanoparticles upon reaction of plant extracts with iron
salt precursors confirms the presence of nZVI (Fe0).39 Reactive iron is likely to
interact with active phytochemicals within plant extracts making it
difficult to form repeating lattice structures required for crystallinity.
This is supported by the amorphous nature of nanoparticles generated
in this study and several other studies producing iron nanoparticles
with plant extracts.37,39−41 In addition
to crystallinity, Fe0 nanoparticles are ferromagnetic in
nature42 and show a representative XPS
peak at 706 eV (Figure 2).43,44

XPS analysis of freshly synthesized iron nanoparticles with
plant
extracts and the C 1s, O 1s, and Fe 2p core levels revealed that the
surface of the particles were composed of a mixture of carbon, oxygen,
and iron species (Figure 2). Carbon peaks for the representative sample showed peaks
at 284.6, 285.5, 286.6, and 288.6 eV corresponding to C=C,
C–O, C–OH, and O–C=O bonds, respectively.45−48 These bonds show that plant bioactive compounds are bound to the
surface of the iron oxide nanoparticles. Oxygen was also present on
the surface of the particles, with peaks 532.1, 533.2, and 534.2 relating
to oxygen in oxyhydroxides, O–C=O, and C–OH/O–N,
respectively49−52 (Figure 2). Iron
signature peaks were numerous and , indicating the presence of mixed
iron oxide species. However, no Fe0 was identified. The
peaks identified around 710.4 and 711.9 relate to Fe3+ species
representative of ferric compounds such as Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and FeOOH.53 Peaks at 715.1, 728.5, and 718.7 are representative of Fe2O3;54,55 however the peak at 711.9 together
with OH groups (peaks at 534.2 and 286.6 eV) point toward the presence
of hydrous iron oxides, such as FeOOH and/or Fe(OH)3.56

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
S. paniculatum showed strong representative
carboxylic
acid signature peaks with O–H stretching bonds between 3200
and 3400 cm–1 and C=O bonds located between
1725 and 1710 cm–1. P. undulatum also possessed these peaks, but its representation in the spectra
was weak (Figure 3). S. molle and S. paniculatum also showed the existence of phenolic compounds by the presence
of O–H stretching bonds between 3200 and 3400 cm–1, C–H stretch between 3000 and 2850 cm–1, and C–O stretching bonds between 1000 and 1100 cm–1.57−59 Peaks located above 3000 cm–1 are unsaturated
and are willing to take part in hydrogen bonding.60,61S. molle and S. paniculatum (and to a minor extent P. undulatum) possessed well-defined peaks in this region, and this may be responsible
for the particles’ tendency to agglomerate.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of iron
nanoparticles generated with different plant
extracts.

All nanoparticle species contained
peaks located in the regions
of 1635–1545, 1430–1350, and ∼1000 cm–1 (Figure 3), which
are representative of the stretching of the carboxylate group (COO−),
bending of O–H bonds from carboxylate groups, and C–O
stretching bonds, respectively. Peaks relating to N–H bending
are also found within the region of 1650–1500 cm–1 and may be masked by the presence of the carboxylate signature.62−64

Nanoparticles from P. undulatum and M. azedarach showed an absence
of strong signatures
above 3000 cm–1 and possessed carboxylate groups,
which have repulsive forces with other carboxylate groups.65 This may explain the formation of monodispersed
nanoparticles generated within these samples.

Hexavalent Chromium Reduction
Within this study, an
equal weight of nanoparticles (5 mg/mL Cr6+ solution) was
added to each treatment vessel as opposed to an equal volume of crude
nanoparticle reaction solution. In this way, we were able to assess
the efficiency of the nanoparticles on Cr6+ removal alone
without the unreacted iron salt and unbound plant extracts interfering
with the degradation kinetics. Mystrioti et al.66 showed that pomegranate and clove plant extracts alone
could remove approximately 25% Cr(VI) from solution over a 2-day period.
This study also showed that clove extract possessed a low polyphenol
content, however, it was still efficient at reducing Cr(VI). The authors
mention that the type of polyphenols present within the plant may
be a more important factor to focus on rather than the total polyphenol
content of specific extracts.

In this current study, the plant
extract of P. undulatum was the only
plant extract, which had an impact on hexavalent chromium reduction
with 100 μL of extract resulting in approximately 35% removal
of Cr(VI) in the same concentration and volumes as the nanoparticle
Cr(VI) removal assays (data not shown). However, as capping of the
particles only ranged from 3.3 to 5.4% of the total weight of the
particles (determined by differences in weight following the removal
of organic matter in a blast furnace at 500 °C for 12 h), their
influence is likely to have a negligible contribution to the overall
Cr(VI) degradation within the nanoparticle treatment microcosms.

Although antioxidant concentration may show trends with increased
reducing powers and hence in the formation of more concentrated nanoparticle
solutions, when the ability of the resulting nanoparticles is assessed
for Cr(VI) removal efficiency, they may not be the best performers.

This current study assessed the capacity of iron nanoparticles
generated from plant extracts with different antioxidant profiles
to remove Cr(VI). Plant-generated nanoparticles (100 mg) with residual
precursors removed were added to aqueous Cr(VI) solutions (20 mL of
50 mg/L solutions). Results showed that P. undulatum- and M. azedarach-generated nanoparticles
had significant and high Cr(VI) removal capacities with rates of 96.2
and 84.1%, respectively, in over 9 h (Figure 4). Nanoparticles generated from S. molle, which showed the lowest antioxidant concentration
and reducing power capacity had the lowest Cr(VI) removal efficiency
(43.7%). However, S. paniculatum, which
possessed the highest antioxidant concentration and reducing power
capacity was only able to achieve 58.7% Cr(VI) removal after 9 h.
As all nanoparticles were made up of mixed oxides, Cr(VI) removal
dynamics was expected to be similar. As Cr(VI) removal after the first
15 min was slow and steady, an absorption mechanism is suggested.
This is supported by Jiang et al.67 who
showed that absorption of Cr(VI) to maghemite nanoparticles was spontaneous
and highly favorable.

Figure 4 Plant-derived nanoparticles (100 mg) efficiency for Cr6+ removal from aqueous solution (20 mL of 50 mg/L Cr6+); P. undulatum, M. azedarach, S. molle, S. paniculatum, and control.

Nanoparticle crystallinity, composition,
surface bonds, and concentrations
were similar (or the same), but their Cr(VI) removal capacities were
different. This may be attributed to the size of the particles. It
is widely documented that a decrease in the nanoparticle size greatly
increases its surface area and in turn increases the available surface
available for interactions to occur.68−70 The nanoparticles that
showed the highest Cr(VI) removal capacities had the smallest nanoparticle
sizes, with most particles falling within the 5–15 nm size
range. In addition, these nanoparticles were also quite monodispersed,
further maximizing the particle surface area. Conversely, the two
worst performing nanoparticle types possessed chainlike structures.
Although the individual particles were nanometric in size, the linking
of particles reduces their surface area, and as a result, they behave
like millimetric-sized particles with reduced Cr(VI) removal capacity.
It should also be mentioned that the type of phytochemicals capping
the nanoparticles may also slow down the interactions between the
pollutant and the particle. To enhance the nanoparticle capacity for
removing Cr(VI) from wastewater, functionalization of nanoparticles
may aid in both monodispersity and selective binding to Cr(VI). S. molle and S. paniculatum both showed agglomeration tendencies, and therefore, additions to
the synthesis solution of species, which are able to counteract particle–particle
attractions may be of benefit. Palma et al. in 2015 employed the use
of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid and oleic acid to generate monodispersed
iron nanoparticles via a thermal decomposition route.71 In addition to the particle size, particle binding affinity
may be enhanced by functionalizing nanoparticle-specific ligands.
Elfeky et al. in 2017 modified iron oxide nanoparticles with cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) and showed enhanced Cr(VI) binding selectivity and
removal efficiencies.72 This treatment
required low pH and the use of CTAB, which has been shown to be toxic
to microorganisms.73 However, if nontoxic
ligands can be applied to nanoparticles, this may aid in elevated
remediation rates.

Conclusions
Reduction of iron salt
precursors with different plant extracts
can generate iron nanoparticles with different morphological features.
However, the phytochemical fingerprints examined in this study were
not comprehensive enough to link the compounds to morphology. All
particles were composed of mixed iron oxide species and were amorphous
in nature. Zero valent iron was not identified and is unlikely to
be present in nanoparticles because of the lack of representative
XRD and XPS peaks along with an absence of magnetism. Nanoparticles
possessed C=C, C–O, O–C=O, and C–OH
bonds on their surface, which was confirmed with XPS and FTIR analysis,
indicating that they were capped with plant-based phytochemicals.
Nanoparticles, which possessed strong O–H bonds peaks in the
FTIR analysis above 3000 cm–1, also showed agglomerated
nanoparticles. The antioxidant concentration of plant extracts was
linked with the reducing power capacity but not with optimum nanoparticle
morphologies for chromium degradation. Plant extracts with the lowest
and highest antioxidant concentrations showed the lowest Cr(VI) removal
capacity for all nanoparticles tested. This was attributed to the
nanoparticle-chained structures formed, which reduced the nanoparticle
surface area and interaction with Cr(VI). P. undulatum and M. azedarach possessed the highest
Cr(VI) removal capacity of 96.2 and 84.1%, respectively. Nanoparticles
of these species were between 5 and 15 nm in size and were monodispersed.
This research presents a green, cost-effective, and efficient technology
for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions. Further research
into the fractionation of plant extracts is required to determine
the specific phytochemicals responsible for instilling specific nanoparticle
traits. In addition, modification of nanoparticles using ligands with
a strong affinity for specific pollutants is expected to deliver elevated
remediation capacities. The immobilization of nanoparticles onto a
solid support may be of interest for removing pollutants and nanoparticles
from the environment following remediation.

Materials and Methodology
Dry Weight
Determination
The water content of the plant
leaves was determined by drying 10 g of fresh plant leaf biomass at
40 °C for 5 h or until no further weight change was apparent.
Percentage moisture content was determined by the following equation  

Preparation of Plant Extracts
Dried plant leaves of
interest (10 g) were added to 100 mL of Milli-Q water and were put
into a water bath at 80 °C for 1 h and then removed and allowed
to cool at room temperature. The solution containing water-soluble
phytochemicals was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and stored
at −20 °C until further use.

Phytochemical Analysis
of Extracts
Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC)
Assay
The antioxidant capacity of the extract was determined
using a modified
method of that described by Stratil et al.74 and Re et al.75 ABTS+ cation
stock solution was created by reacting 1:1 (v/v) of 7 mM ABTS (2,2′
azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) stock solution to
4.90 mM potassium persulfate solution (2.45 mM final concentration).
This solution was left to stand for 15 h at 25 ± 2 °C in
the dark to form the radical cation ABTS•+.

To determine the TEAC, the ABTS+ solution was diluted
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to get an absorbance
reading [optical density (OD)] between 1.0 and 1.5 at 734 nm when
200 μL of the sample was measured on a 96-well plate reader
(BMG POLARstarOmega).

A Trolox standard curve was created by
making serial dilutions
of an initial 1.5 mM Trolox solution in PBS. Ten microliters of the
Trolox solutions was added to 19 0 μL of ABTS•+ solution in a 96-well plate (COSTAR). Spectrophotometric measurements
at 734 nm were taken exactly 6 min after initial mixing, and increased
antioxidant concentration was determined by a decrease in the OD values.

The aforementioned procedure was repeated with 10 μL of plant
extract. Dilutions of plant extract (diluted in PBS, pH 7.4) were
made if values fell outside the measurable range, and OD values were
multiplied by the dilution factor. Findings are expressed as Trolox
equivalents/g plant biomass [mM Trolox (equiv)/g]

PBS (pH 7.4)
and Trolox mixed with each corresponding plant extract
in volumes used (without ABTS•+) served as controls
and standards.

Folin–Ciocalteu Assay
The
phenolic content of
plant extracts was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method,
as outlined by Meda et al.76 and Moein
et al.77 Briefly, the plant extract (50
μL) was added to 450 μl of Milli-Q water and filtered
through a Whatman no. 1 filter paper. An aliquot (50 μL) of
this solution was then mixed with 250 μL of 0.2 M Folin–Ciocalteu
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Steinheim, Germany) for 5 min, and
200 μL of 75 g/L sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) (Labosi, Paris, France) was added. After incubation at room temperature
for 2 h, the absorbance of 150 μL from the reaction mixture
was measured at 760 nm against methanol blank in a 96-well plate reader.
Phenolic content is expressed as GA equivalents/g plant biomass [mg
GA (equiv)/g].

The linear region of a standard curve, generated
from the reaction of the above solution with GA (0–0.50 mg/mL),
was used to determine the phenol content of plant extract samples
(GA equivalents).

Reducing Power Assay
The Fe3+ reducing power
(antioxidant capacity assay) of the extract was determined using the
methods outlined by Berker et al.78 with
modifications relating to the incubation method and the volumes of
reagents. Briefly, 100 μL pf Milli-Q H2O, 30 μL
of 0.20 M HCl, 30 μL of ferricyanide solution (1%), 10 μL
of sodium dodecyl sulfate (1%), and 10 μL of FeCl3·6H2O (0.2%) were combined to make a total of 180
μL solution.

The plant extract or the standard to be tested
was made up to 20 μL with ethanol (96%). The volume of the sample
added to ethanol needed to be optimized to fit within measurable parameters,
and this differed between samples tested.

Both the aforementioned
final solutions were mixed together to
make a 200 μL solution, which was incubated at 50 °C within
a thermocycler (Bio-Rad, T-100) for 20 min and then held at room temperature
until further use. An aliquot (150 μL) of the resulting sample
was transferred to a 96-well plate (COSTAR), and the absorbance was
measured at 700 nm (A700) against a reagent
blank within 25 min.

AA solution (0.0–100.0 μg/mL)
was used as the standard.
Increased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated increased reducing
power. Findings are expressed as l-AA equivalents/g plant
biomass [mg AA (equiv)/g]. All measurements were conducted in triplicate
in a 96-well plate reader, BMG Labtech, Germany.

3,5-Dinitrosalicylic
Acid (DNS) Assay
The reducing
sugar content of plant extracts was determined using the DNS method,
as outlined by King et al.79 Briefly, DNS
working solution was prepared by combining 10 g of DNS with 403 g
of KNaC4H4O6·4H2O
and then made up to 1 L in 0.4 M NaOH (heated at 50 °C till dissolved).
The solution was then filtered through a 0.45 μm filter.

Sixty microliters of glucose standard (0.0–3.0 mg/mL) prepared
in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 or filtered plant extract was
added to 120 μL of DNS working solution in PCR tubes. PCR tubes
were then placed into a PCR thermocycler (Bio-Rad, T-100), and the
incubation cycle was set at 95 °C for 5 min, cooling to 48 °C
for 1 min, and holding at 20 °C.

Fifty microliters of the
completed DNS reaction product was then
added to 150 μL of Milli-Q H2O in flat-bottom microplates
(COSTAR), and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Findings are
expressed as glucose equivalents/g plant biomass [mg glucose (equiv)/g].

Ferrous Ion-Chelating Activity
The capacity of plant
extracts to chelate Fe2+ ions was determined using the
protocol described by Decker and Welch80 with some minor modifications. Briefly, to a flat-bottom 96-well
plate (COSTAR), the following were added: 67.5 μL of Milli-Q
water, 50.0 μL of the standard or plant extract, and 2.5 μL
of FeCl2·4H2O (2 mM). The reaction was
initiated by addition and thorough mixing of 5.0 μL of ferrozine
solution (5 mM), and the reaction was allowed to develop in the dark
for 10 min. Absorbance values were measured using a 96-well plate
reader (BMG POLARstarOmega, BMG Labtech, Germany) at 562 nm. The linear
region of a standard curve, generated from the reaction of the above
solution with EDTA (0–250 mg/mL) was used to determine the
metal chelation capacity of the plant extract samples. Results are
expressed as EDTA equivalents/g plant biomass [mg EDTA (equiv)/g]

Iron Nanoparticle Synthesis
Preparation of Iron Nanoparticles
The plant extract
was mixed in a beaker at top speed using a magnetic stirrer, and 0.1
M FeCl3·6H2O solution was slowly introduced
using a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 2 mL/min, ensuring a
2:1 ratio v/v of plant extract to FeCl3·6H2O, respectively. The color of the solution changed to black indicating
the synthesis of nanoparticles. The resulting solution was centrifuged
at 14 000g for 30 min within Amicon Ultra-0.5
Centrifugal Filter Devices with 10 kDa cutoff; the flowthrough was
discarded and the nanoparticles pelleted on the filter were resuspended
in Milli-Q water, frozen to −80 °C, and lyophilized.

Characterization of Plant-Generated Nanoparticles
Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM characterization
was undertaken for nanoparticles prior to the dye degradation reaction.
Plant extract-generated nanoparticle samples were prepared by drop-coating
the samples on a carbon-coated copper grid. The grid was left to dry
overnight in a dust-free environment, and the morphological characteristics
of iron nanoparticles were analyzed with a JEOL1010 TEM operated at
100 kV (Thermoemission cathode).

FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopy spectra of freeze-dried
plant extracts, plant extract-generated iron nanoparticles, and plant-generated
nanoparticles with organic material burnt off at 500 °C for 10
h in a muffle furnace were determined by a Fourier transform infrared
spectroscope (PerkinElmer Frontier). Nanoparticles were freeze-dried,
washed in Milli-Q water, and centrifuged at 14 000g, and the nanoparticles were retained. Nanoparticles were dried at
room temperature before being processed by a spectroscope. An average
of 18 scans was collected for each measurement with a resolution of
0.5 cm–1 in the range of 4000–400 cm–1.

XRD
To determine the crystalline
phases of plant-generated
nanoparticle, XRD analysis was conducted using a Bruker AXS D8 Discover
diffraction instrument equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source
(wavelength 0.1542 nm) operating at 40 kV and 35 mA. All X-ray data
were obtained in the u–2u locked-couple mode over a 2u interval of 10–60.
The identity of the diffraction peaks was assigned through auto-fitting
in the instrument software (Bruker Evaluation).

XPS
Nanoparticle surface compositions were analyzed
by XPS (Thermo K-Alpha XPS). The instrument was equipped with an Al
Kα X-ray radiation source with a photon energy of 1486.6 eV.
All measurements were conducted at room temperature under ultrahigh
vacuum (10–8 Pa). The C 1s, O 1s, and Fe 2p core
level spectra were recorded with an overall resolution of 0.1 eV.
The spectra were handled with Avantage 4.88 Surface Chemical Analysis
Software, Thermo Scientific.

Hexavalent Chromium Removal
Aqueous solutions of Cr6+ (20 mL of 50 mg/L) were prepared
with K2Cr2O7 and buffered to pH 3.5
in acetate buffer. The
diphenylcarbazide (DPC) method was used to determine Cr6+ species in solution81 with some minor
modifications. To each Cr6+ solution, 130 μL of DPC
solution (200 mg of DPC/10 mL of acetone) was added. After 10 min,
time 0 OD(540nm) measurements were taken using a BMG POLARstarOmega
using COSTAR flat-bottom 96-well plates. Following this, 100 mg of
plant-generated nanoparticles was added to vessels and periodic OD(540nm) measurements were taken for over 9 h.

Hexavalent
chromium removal efficiency (%) was calculated as follows  where C0 is the
OD(540nm) of the hexavalent chromium/DPC complex at time
0 and Ct is the OD(540nm) of hexavalent chromium/DPC complex at time t.

Statistical Analysis
The concentrations
of all bioactive
components were compared within plant species and between plant species.
Univariate ANOVA pairwise comparison coupled with Tukey and Duncan’s
multiple comparison post hoc tests were used to identify correlations
at a 0.05 level.
