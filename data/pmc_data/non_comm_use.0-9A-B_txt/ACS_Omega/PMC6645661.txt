Balancing the contradiction
between portability and analytical
performances of a miniaturized mass spectrometer is vital to extend
its on-site applications. In this study, triboelectric nanogenerator
(TENG)-driven ion sources were coupled with our home-built Mini 2000
system and applied to the analyses of different samples. Compared
with the conventional direct current (DC) nanoelectrospray ionization
(nanoESI) source, the ion intensity of the TENG-nanoESI miniature
mass spectrometer was improved by ∼3 times. Moreover, maybe
due to the different pathways of ion formation in comparison with
DC electrospray, TENG electrospray is shown to reduce the salt suppression
effect during ionization. With these figures of merit, the direct
detection of reserpine in saliva was demonstrated using the TENG-Mini
2000 system.

1 Introduction
Owing to its high sensitivity,
molecular specificity, and accurate
quantitative analysis, mass spectrometry (MS) has a wide range of
applications in biomedicine, food science, forensic field, drug discovery,
and other fields.1−5 Commercial in-lab mass spectrometers typically have some disadvantages
such as large size, high power consumption, strict working environmental
conditions and complex operational procedures,6,7 which
limit the use of these MS systems for in-field applications. An ideal
instrument for in situ applications should be small and portable.
Miniature mass spectrometry broadens its application areas to environmental
monitoring, public security, space exploration and personal healthcare.8−12 Besides, a miniature mass spectrometer for in situ detection is
also expected to have adequate analytical performances in terms of
sensitivity and mass resolution, as well as simplified operational
procedures.

Until now, various kinds of miniature mass spectrometers
have been
developed rapidly, which mainly involve miniaturized mass analyzers,13−16 ion transfer devices,17 and compact electronic
and vacuum systems.18−20 A miniaturized ion funnel could increase ion transfer
efficiency.17,21 Mass analyzers have also been
miniaturized, which could help in terms of reducing the requirements
of the electronic system, as well as increasing its tolerance to higher
buffer gas pressures.22−25 Ionization is the first step in mass spectrometry; the voltage applied
is used to convert neutrals into gas-phase ions for mass analysis.26−28 Conventional direct current (DC) high-voltage power creates ion
sources suffering from inherent disadvantages, such as high cost,
limited portability and safety concerns.29−31 The recent
demonstration that charge pulses can trigger an electrospray ionization
(ESI) process provided a new method for developing highly convenient
and robust devices to control the ionization process.32−34 Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are one of the sustainable
power sources that can transform mechanical energy into electricity.35−37 Recently, TENG-driven ion sources for mass spectrometric analysis
have been reported.38 Small organic molecules
and biomolecules were all successfully detected by TENG-ESI MS. TENG
ion sources not only improve the sensitivity of analysis but also
avoid the destructive corona discharge phenomenon while electrospraying
solutions with high surface tension under high voltages.39

In this work, we report a TENG-driven
ion source integrated with
our home-built Mini 2000 system12,17,40 for the analysis of a wide range of chemical compounds, ranging
from small organic molecules to large biomolecules. TENG-ESI showed
enhanced sensitivity and high salt tolerance. Reserpine in saliva
or human serum without pretreatment was successfully detected by TENG-Mini
2000, which is an improvement for the application of practical complex
sample analysis by Mini 2000.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chemical Samples
Peptide Met–Arg–Phe–Ala
(MRFA) (MW 524) and protein cytochrome c were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Reserpine (MW 609) was purchased from Acros Organics
(NJ). High-performance liquid chromatography-grade methanol was purchased
from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ). Purified water was obtained
from Wahaha (Hangzhou, China). Saliva and serum samples were collected
from normal volunteers. The MRFA solution used in experiments were
all dissolved in methanol/H2O (1:1, v/v), and the protein
sample was prepared in 1:1 (v/v) methanol and deionized water with
addition of 1:1000 formic acid.

2.2 Fabrication
and Operation of TENGs
The TENG was prepared by physical
vapor deposition of 1 μm
aluminum on a 50 μm-thick poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) film, forming
two 75 × 60 mm2 rectangular areas separated by a 75
× 1 mm2 uncoated rectangular region (as shown in Figure 2a). And then the
PVC was mounted on the acrylic. The movable TENG part consists of
an Al foil (55 × 65 mm2), a piece of sponge, and an
acrylic board. In the process of operating the TENG, the movable parts
were mounted on a linear motor, and the static part was fixed onto
a stage. These two parts are mounted face to face to ensure an optimal
contact between the PVC surface and the Al foil. High-frequency pulses
were generated by rapidly switching the sliding direction at a defined
sliding speed. The output voltage of the device was very stable throughout
the experiments.

2.3 Mini Mass Spectrometric
Analysis
As shown in Figure 1a, the home-built mini-MS was constructed with a two-stage
vacuum
chamber maintained by a differential pump system. The first vacuum
is realized by a diaphragm pump (50 L/min, SVF-E0-50, Scroll Tech
Inc., China), and a turbo pump (80 L/s, Hipace80, Pfeiffer Inc., Germany)
is installed on the second chamber to further improve the degree of
vacuum. A linear ion trap with hyperbolic electrodes (x0 = y0 = 4 mm, z0 = 40 mm) was placed in the second vacuum stage. The
ion detector consists of a home-built dynode used to generate secondary
electrons and an electron multiplier (model 2500, Detech Inc.) to
amplify the signal. The first vacuum chamber is connected to atmosphere
by a stainless-steel capillary (length of 10 cm and inner diameter
of 0.25 mm), and a pinhole (length of 1 mm and inner diameter of 0.4
mm) was placed between these two vacuum chambers. An external high-voltage
interface can provide DC voltage (0 to ±5000 V), which was used
for the ionization source. A platinum electrode is inserted inside
the tips of the capillaries used as nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI)
sources. The photo of this mini-MS (Mini 2000) is shown in Figure 1b, which has dimensions
of 38 × 23 × 24 cm3 (length × width ×
height). DC-nanoESI/TENG-nanoESI measurements were also conducted
by Mini 2000 using the same electrospray emitter tip.

with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Working
Mechanism and Performance of TENG
Figure 2b shows the working mechanism of the freestanding-mode
TENG; the alternating flow of electrons is generated between the triboelectrification
and electrostatic induction electrodes. When Al contacts PVC, electrons
will be injected from the Al surface to the PVC film, due to the differences
in the ability to attract electrons.35,36 As the movable
part slides forward (from state i to state ii), the tribo-charges
in the interface regions are separated, resulting in a higher potential
in the right electrode than that in the left one; thus the electrons
will be driven, flowing from the left electrode to the right one through
the outer circuit (meaning a current flow in the reverse direction,
as shown in Figure 2b-ii). In this process, electrons keep moving until the movable part
reaches the right edge of the static plate, which is demonstrated
in Figure 2b-iii. At
that instant, the amount of transferred charges between the two electrodes
reaches the maximum value. As the movable part moves back, the electrons
will flow back from the right electrode to the left one (Figure 2b-iv). Therefore,
the entire process results in an alternating-current pulse output.
The output performance is plotted in Figure 2c,d. It is found that the device outputs
a voltage of around 1400 V, and the amount of transferred charges
was about 272 nC.

3.2 Analyses
of MRFA
Operated in a pulsed
fashion, higher ionization efficiency was achieved using the TENG-driven
nanoESI.38 When integrated with our home-built
miniature mass spectrometer (Figure 2b), the analytical performance of the mini-MS was expected
to be improved. First, a 500 ppb MRFA sample was tested using the
standard DC (1 kV) nanoESI method. In comparison, the TENG (∼1.4
kV) nanoESI using the same nanoESI emitter could enhance the ion intensity
by 3–4-fold at the same concentration level (Figure 3b,c).

To evaluate the
sensitivity of the system, we chose the commonly used peptide, MRFA.
In the experiments, different concentrations of MRFA were detected
in both standard DC-nanoESI and TENG-nanoESI modes with the same nanoESI
emitter. Unless otherwise specified, the parameters of the instrument
remain unchanged. The quantitative curves of MRFA are shown in Figure 3a. Limit of detection (LOD) values of 10 and 50 ppb MRFA were
obtained with TENG-nanoESI and DC-nanoESI, respectively. Figure 3d,e plot the corresponding
mass spectra at 10 ppb using TENG-nanoESI and DC-nanoESI, respectively.
To ensure the reliability, at least three repeated tests with different
spray tips were carried out under each condition and a S/N ratio of
5 was maintained in each test.

Figure 3 Linear quantitation curves for MRFA with
a LOD of 50 ppb for DC-nanoESI
and 10 ppb for TENG-nanoESI are shown in (a). TENG-nanoESI (b, d)
are compared to conventional nanoESI spectra (c, e) obtained with
500 ppb MRFA and 10 ppb MRFA, respectively.

To fully demonstrate the feasibility of TENG-nanoESI under
salt
buffer applications, MRFA in methanol/H2O (1:1) with different
concentrations of NaCl solution (1, 10, and 25 mM) was further analyzed.
In this case, the observed peaks were predominantly [M]+ (m/z 524) and [M + Na]+ (m/z 547). As indicated in Figure 4d,e, compared with
DC-nanoESI, a better signal intensity with a 2-fold sensitivity improvement
of MRFA could be achieved by TENG-nanoESI, whereas there is no enhancement
of the [M + Na]+ signal intensity in the high sodium salt
solution (25 mM Na+). Figure 4a compares the intensity of MRFA at different
sodium concentrations with standard and TENG-nanoESI, and the results
show that TENG-nanoESI did not increase the ion intensity of [M +
Na]+, but it could improve the intensity of the [M + H]+ ion very well. TENG-nanoESI showed good reproducibility and
salt tolerance. The phenomenon showed the potential of using the TENG
ionization source for the analysis of samples containing sodium ions
directly with Mini 2000, without sample preparation or cleanup.

electrospray ionization mass spectra of MRFA in methanol/H2O (1:1) obtained from 0, 1, 10, and 25 mM NaCI solution. TENG-nanoESI
spectra (b, d) are compared with conventional nanoESI spectra (c,
e) obtained in MRFA without Na+ and 25 mM Na+ solution, respectively.

3.3 Analyses of Protein
Due to the miniature
electronic systems, the mass range of the Mini mass spectrometer is
lower than the commercial MS instruments in labs. Therefore, it could
be detected by increasing the charges of large biomolecules. However,
the mass spectra are still not satisfactory within the mass range
of Mini 2000. In this experiment, cytochrome c was selected to verify
the performance of the instrument. Upon using the TENG-driven nanoESI
source, well-resolved charge state distributions of cytochrome c primarily
produced from the 11+ to 16+ charge states were observed in Figure 5a. In comparison,
for the same sample using the traditional DC-nanoESI source, charge
state distributions from 12+ and 15+ were detected with lower intensity
(Figure 5b). Results
indicated that the TENG-nanoESI source could improve the performance
of the Mini 2000 instrument in terms of detecting proteins.

miniature mass spectrometers.

3.4 Direct Analyses of Drug in Saliva and Human
Serum
Practical samples, such as saliva and human serum,
have very complex matrices. Surface-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass
spectrometry was developed for testing of illicit drugs in saliva,
urine, and blood.41 However, direct analysis
of drug in saliva or serum by ESI-MS remains a great challenge.42 Conventionally, complicated sample pretreatment
procedures, including chromatography and some microextraction techniques,
are performed before MS analysis.42−44 However, in practical
detection using a miniature mass spectrometer, the sample pretreatment
equipment is very restricted. Therefore, it is very ideal to handle
these complex samples directly with minimum sample pretreatments.

The TENG-nanoESI-coupled Mini 2000 has shown enhanced ion intensity
and low sodium suppression effect. Therefore, the TENG-nanoESI-integrated
Mini-MS was further tested to analyze real samples without any sample
pretreatment. As a demonstration, reserpine was spiked into saliva
and normal human serum. Prior to analysis, the saliva stock solution
was mixed with the same volume of methanol/H2O (1:1 v/v),
whereas human serum was not diluted. Then the untreated saliva and
serum were directly tested by Mini 2000, as shown in Figure 6. Reserpine in saliva (Figure 6a,b) and normal human
serum (Figure 6c,d)
was detected by DC- and TENG-driven nanoESI sources, respectively.
Upon using the DC-driven mode, no reserpine signal was obtained. However,
a satisfactory signal can be observed for reserpine (m/z 609) in saliva and serum at a final concentration
of 5 ppm upon using the TENG-driven mode. Results suggest that the
TENG-nanoESI source coupled with the Mini 2000 could be applied in
applications of complex sample analysis with minimum sample pretreatment.
The underlying mechanism of TENG-nanoESI is similar to that of alternating
current or pulsed voltage-triggered ESI.32,34 The alternatingly induced voltage generates quasi-simultaneous production
of both positive and negative ions. The electric field generated within
the liquid flow would drive ions flowing toward or away from the ESI
tip, which depends on the charge polarity and electric field direction.
This electric field would have stronger effects on smaller ions, such
as salt ions, since they would travel longer distances, and therefore,
setting up a separation and cleaning effect.

in saliva and human serum using the DC-nanoESI

4 Conclusions
In summary, TENG-nanoESI has high salt tolerance, good reproducibility,
and could improve the sensitivity of Mini 2000. As a demonstration,
reserpine in saliva and serum was directly detected using the TENG-nanoESI
and Mini 2000. TENG is a suitable ion source for portable mass spectrometers,
which opens the door for further applications of direct complex sample
analysis.
