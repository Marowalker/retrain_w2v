The
adhesive and mechanical properties of a modular fusion protein
consisting of two different types of binding units linked together
via a flexible resilin-like-polypeptide domain are quantified. The
adhesive domains have been constructed from fungal cellulose-binding
modules (CBMs) and an amphiphilic hydrophobin HFBI. This study is
carried out by single-molecule force spectroscopy, which enables stretching
of single molecules. The fusion proteins are designed to self-assemble
on the cellulose surface, leading into the submonolayer of proteins
having the HFBI pointing away from the surface. A hydrophobic atomic
force microscopy (AFM) tip can be employed for contacting and lifting
the single fusion protein from the HFBI-functionalized terminus by
the hydrophobic interaction between the tip surface and the hydrophobic
patch of the HFBI. The work of rupture, contour length at rupture
and the adhesion forces of the amphiphilic end domains are evaluated
under aqueous environment at different pHs.

Introduction
In
nature, many solutions are hierarchical and based on modular
design that allows the flexibility to serve for multiple purposes.1 To understand how nature works and to be able
to learn from it, engineering of materials and their quantitative
understanding on a molecular level is essential. Genetic engineering
is a powerful tool that can be employed for creating new modular designs
of molecules.

Proteins that are both adhesive and elastic are
attractive as molecular
building blocks because of their ability to create elastic and energy
dissipative interfaces between the components of hybrid materials.
Examples of natural hybrid materials where the adhesive proteins are
present at the interfaces are composite structures such as nacre2 and squid beak.3 In
this study, a modular protein construct built from an elastic domain
(resilin) and two adhesive functionalities (two cellulose-binding
domains, dCBMs, and hydrophobin, HFBI) is investigated on the molecular
level. Cellulose-binding modules (CBMs) are produced by different
organisms and occur for instance in various types of cellulase enzymes.4−6 CBMs have a specific affinity to cellulose surfaces, but for increased
affinity, they can be combined into double CBMs.7 Fusion proteins containing the dCBM have been investigated,
for example, for stabilizing emulsions and as building blocks in biomimetic
nanocomposites.8,9

Hydrophobins are small amphiphilic
surfactant-like molecules produced
by filamentous fungi.10 Class II hydrophobins
have a diameter of 3 nm, and they have the tendency to form monolayer
films at the air/water interface with a remarkably high shear elastic
modulus, about 0.5 N m–1.10,11 Because of their properties, hydrophobins have been used to enhance
the biocompatibility of surfaces for potential applications in biodevices.
For example, HFBI-/collagen-modified poly- dimethylsiloxane surfaces
have been designed to promote cell adhesion and growth.12 Similarly, the growth of neural stem cells was
promoted on layers of serum proteins that are immobilized on hydrophobin-modified
polylactic-co-glycolic acid surfaces: the better
adhesion of serum proteins on the HFBI-modified surfaces and the consequent
enhancement of cell immobilization improved the biocompatibility of
implants after screening.13 HFBI can even
be used to produce lipid-free membranes and vesicles.14

Resilin is an elastomeric protein present in the
specialized regions
of the insect cuticle and plays a key role in insect flight, jumping
mechanism of fleas, and vocalization of cicadas.15 It is a rubberlike protein, according to the criteria of
having high resilience and low stiffness, being able to deform reversibly
without loss of energy.16,17 Furthermore, resilin
is able to be deformed to large elongation under little force.18,19 When it is completely hydrated, resilin behaves close to a perfect
rubber,20−22 has a rather low stiffness, and can be stretched
to more than three times and compressed to one-third of its original
length. Furthermore, when stressed and released again, it goes back
to its initial state without having any residual deformations.20 For resilin in the elastic tendons of dragonflies
and locust ligaments, Young’s moduli of 0.6–0.7 and
0.9 MPa were found, respectively.16 In
the form of resilin-like polypeptide (RLP), resilin has been applied
for tissue engineering and in the medical field.23−25

Single-molecule
force spectroscopy (SMFS) is revealed as a great
technique to study biological systems from cells26 to biomacromolecules.27,28 Concerning
elastomeric proteins, previous studies have been carried out, for
example, on tropoelastin29 and on REC (R
= resilin, E = elastin, and C = collagen like molecules) polypeptides30 but not on resilin.

In this study, the
mechanical and adhesive properties of two modular
fusion proteins (Figure 1) were studied: the first protein was constructed from hydrophobin
HFBI and a double CBM separated by a linker of 24 amino acids (HFBI–dCBM).
For the second, the same building blocks were used but the linker
region was replaced by a RLP (dCBM–RLP–HFBI).

and sizes of the studied modular proteins. (A)

up of an OTS-functionalized tip approaching on a cellulose-coated
surface with the proteins casted on it. The sizes are estimated from
the amino acid sequences (see Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2).

These proteins were used to study how adhesive
proteins act as
building blocks in hybrid nanomaterials. Therefore, the force response
of both fusion proteins under tensile force using SMFS was recorded.
The attachment of the molecule to the chosen surfaces occurred via
self-assembly of the terminal units, dCBM being able to bind to cellulose
and HFBI to a hydrophobic surface, allowing the linker region unbound
and available for stretching. Similar approaches have been previously
taken for studies of modular proteins such as titin-mimicking protein
constructs.31−34 The importance of the single-molecule perspective on the development
of nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical properties is evident because
only by quantifying the smallest scale events, it is possible to progress
toward higher levels of hierarchy.

Results and Discussion
SMFS Experiments
The SMFS experiment was carried out
by approaching the surface-immobilized fusion proteins with a hydrophobic
octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-coated tip and then retracting the
tip, as shown schematically in Figure 2A,B.

Figure 2 (A) Schematic representation of the SMFS experiment: as
the hydrophobic
tip is approaching the surface, the hydrophobins will attach to the
tip. (B) Tip retraction leads to elongation of the attached protein
and eventual detachment of the protein from the tip. Typical force/distance
curves, with fit included, measured for (C) HFBI–dCBM molecule,
(D) dCBM–RLP–HFBI molecule at pH 5, and (E) at pH 11
and for the (F) cellulose surface at pH 5 and (G) at pH 11. On the
right column, a schematic of the molecules/surfaces involved in the
stretching is reported.

The proteins were adhered on a thin cellulose layer via adsorption
through the dCBM. Typical force/distance curves are represented in Figure 2C–G, where
the typical retraction curve had only one peak that most probably
shows the detachment event of a single molecule. More examples of
force/distance curves are reported in Figure S2. For both the fusion proteins and the plain cellulose surface, the
experiments were performed in 10 mM NaAc buffer solution at pH 5.
dCBM–RLP–HFBI and the plain cellulose surface were also
studied at pH 11 in 10 mM phosphate buffer.

The force values
corresponding to the last detachment of the tip
from the surface were collected from the force/distance curves and
are presented as a histogram in Figure 3A.

(C) persistence length, and (D) work of rupture for HFBI–dCBM
at pH 5 (black bars) and dCBM–RLP–HFBI at pH 5 (pink
bars) and at pH 11 (red bars). The graphs (B,D) show the insets respectively
for the contour length of HFBI–dCBM and the work of rupture
of HFBI–dCBM and dCBM–RLP–dCBM at pH 5 to point
out the distribution of the values in the lower range of x-axis.

The distribution of the adhesive
forces follows approximately a
normal distribution. For HFBI–dCBM and dCBM–RLP–HFBI
proteins at pH 5, the values vary between 50 and 200 pN, whereas at
pH 11, the distribution is wider and the values vary between 0 and
800 pN. The contour length, the persistence length, and the work of
rupture were extracted, as explained in the Materials
and Methods section, and are presented in Figure 3B–D. The mean values
and standard deviation of the data are presented in Table 1.

Thickness and
Elasticity of the Cellulose and Proteins
To have a correct
interpretation of the molecular response during
the force spectroscopy experiments, it was important to know the consistence
and the organization of the molecules and the cellulose on the top
of the silicon surface.

The adsorption of the fusion proteins
on the spin-coated cellulose was studied by measuring the adsorbed
mass and the change in the dissipation of the quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM-D) sensor simultaneously (Figure 4).

Figure 4 QCM-D experiment on protein adsorption on the cellulose
surface
and consequent conformational changes. (A) Frequency change at pHs
5 and 11 on a cellulose-coated gold sensor (orange) and after injection
(black arrow) of 0.1 mg mL−1 HFBI−dCBM (red)
and dCBM−RLP−HFBI (black) on the cellulose surface.
(B) Dissipation and (C) thickness change during the same experiment.

The data show a clear decrease
of the frequency, indicating an
adsorption of the proteins in NaAc buffer. Switching the pH to 11,
a further decrease in Δf was observed for the
RLP probably because of a conformational change and only a slight
Δf change for HFBI–dCBM. The dissipation
signal in the NaAc buffer rapidly increased during the adsorption
of dCBM–RLP–HFBI but stabilized after the protein film
was formed in a rather modest value near 10–6. At
pH 11, the dissipation signal drove up to 8 × 10–6 meaning an increase of viscoelasticity because of the swelling.
This swelling effect of the resilin is reflected by a change in the
thickness from 10 nm at pH 5 to 30 nm at pH 11. The increase of the
dissipation during the adsorption of HFBI–dCBM was less pronounced.
A control measurement on cellulose was carried out to investigate
the pH effect on the cellulose layer. Switching from pH 5 to 11, only
modest changes in frequency and dissipation were observed.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of Figure 5 visualize the different
morphologies of
the cellulose surface and the proteins at different environments.
Comparing the images of the pure cellulose layer (Figure 5A,D) reveals that changing
the pH from 5 to 11 leads to an increased roughness, although the
cellulose layer does not swell significantly, as shown by QCM-D graphs.
The pH in fact affects the consistence of the film that appears in
a less ordered structure.

5; (B) HFBI–dCBM
and (C) dCBM–RLP–HFBI drop-casted on the cellulose at
pH 5; (D) cellulose surface at pH 11; and (E) HFBI–dCBM and

11. Insets represent a section analysis of the position indicated
by the red line. The images were recorded on wet conditions under
the respective buffer. Height range z from black
to white is given in each image.

The adsorption of dCBM–RLP–HFBI on the cellulose
at pH 5 increases the surface roughness, and the proteins are visible
as small, randomly organized features having a height of 5–7
nm (Figure 5C). At
pH 11, the protein film was strongly swollen, which was observed as
increased roughness and smeared image of the surface having up to
40 nm height variation (Figure 5F). For HFBI–dCBM, it
was possible to observe a change in the morphological structure at
different conditions, but no swelling could be observed at pH 11.
Additional AFM images at pH 5 are reported in Figure S5.

Extension of the Molecules
For comparing
the experimental
values obtained for the dimensions of the molecules, a theoretical
size of the proteins was estimated based on the amino acid sequence
and the conformation of different regions, assuming alternative random
coils and extended linker regions (Figure S1). Because the binding modules are globular and cross-linked, it
may be assumed that they are stable under the tensile stress applied
in the AFM experiment and thus will not extend in the experiment.
The RLP is an unstructured protein, which in the relaxed form assumes
a random coil conformation stabilized by weak interactions between
the hydrophobic amino acids.35 Thus, it
was assumed that the resilin can have either a random coil or an extended
conformation, especially under the tensile stress, and thus the length
of the folded RLP was estimated by calculating both the radius of
gyration and the extended length. All of the values calculated in
this manner for both proteins are given in Tables S1 and S2.

The estimated dimensions of HFBI–dCBM
match well with the measured contour length. The experimental contour
length of dCBM–RLP–HFBI at pH 5, however, followed a
bimodal distribution having two probable values, a shorter one, 29
nm, indicating a coiled structure and a longer one, 93 nm indicating
a more extended conformation (Figure 6A,B).

Figure 6 Schematic of different conformations of the resilin-like
peptide
at the detachment of the molecule. (A) At pH 5, resilin assumes a
random coil conformation. (B) At pH 11, resilin assumes an extended
conformation. (C,D) Attachment of multiple entangled resilin molecules
at pH 11.

At pH 11, four Gaussian curves
were fitted to the data to obtain
a good overall fit. The mean values of the contour lengths at pH 11
were 64, 133, 149, and 243 nm. When comparing the estimated lengths
(32 nm folded and 136 nm extended) with the measured contour lengths,
it appears that the shorter observed detachment length at pH 5, matches
well with the conformation where RLP is assumed to have the random
coil structure. The second mode of detachment at pH 5 has a contour
length of ca. 90 nm which is between the values of the partially and
fully extended proteins. This indicates that dCBM–RLP–HFBI
is partly stretched before detachment at pH 5. At pH 11, the experimental
contour length had more quantized values, indicating more possible
conformations. The shortest value represents a swollen coil, and the
mid values that represent the majority of the measurements, 133 and
149, are close to the fully extended chain. At elevated pH, the cellulose
also slightly swells to some extent as presented in the discussion
of the AFM images and becomes softer (see section Elasticity of the Protein Layer). This could well explain
the third and fourth contour length that are above the theoretical
extended chain value, possibly because of the stretching of the cellulose
substrate before the detachment of the protein. The control measurements
on the plain cellulose surface showed values of the contour length
of 10–30 nm that may refer to the “loosening of some
cellulose chains”. In Figure S6,
the histograms of the rupture force, the work of rupture, and the
contour and persistence length for plain cellulose are presented.
The values covered a range between 0 and 200 pN of force, 0–600E/kT of energy, and 10–25 nm of
contour length. Entanglement of the proteins at elevated pH may also
lead to the contour lengths exceeding 200 nm (Figure 6D).

For the persistence length of the
proteins, the values were typically
considerably smaller than 0.36 nm, which would be expected for a polypeptide.36 Only HFBI–dCBM had a significant number
of measured values on the typical range, whereas most of the values
of the RLP proteins were much lower than expected. In the literature,
low persistence length values have been reported for situations where
more filaments than only one are stretched simultaneously during the
tip–protein detachment.36 Entanglement
of the resilins and their mutual interactions would explain such behavior
in the system studied here (Figure 6D). To explicit this statement, a closer analysis of
the distributions of the measured data for dCBM–RLP–HFBI
at pH 11 is reported in Figure S7.

The event of stretching a single molecule was observed in almost
2% for HFBI–dCBM and almost 6 and 18% for dCBM–RLP–HFBI
at pH 5 and 11, respectively.

Adhesion of the Molecules
The QCM-D experiment (Figure 4) indicates that
both the fusion proteins adhered to the cellulose surface as a monolayer.
The estimated molecular densities imply a slightly lower density for
the larger RLP-containing fusion protein, which can be explained with
the larger dimensions of this molecule. In the SMFS experiments, a
much lower protein concentration of 0.1 μM was used to obtain
a very low molecular density on the surface and hence to increase
the probability of single-molecule pickup events.

The rupture
forces observed for HFBI–dCBM and dCBM–RLP–HFBI
at pH 5 were in the range between 50 and 200 pN and can be attributed
to the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic side of the
fusion protein and the OTS tip. These values are in accordance with
the previous measurements where a single molecule has been in contact
between the tip and the surface.37−39 Moreover, theoretical
simulations predict that HFBI adsorbs to CH3-SAM preferably
with its hydrophobic patch toward the surface.40 Previous studies have shown for polymers41 and DNA strands42 as well as
for proteins37 and peptides43 binding toward hydrophobic surfaces a range
of force values between 50 and 200 pN. Adhesin proteins expressed
by bacteria showed a similar behavior toward the hydrophobic surfaces.44

The rupture forces obtained for dCBM–RLP–HFBI
at
pH 11, however, are much larger than those commonly recorded for single
molecules. The change in the pH should mainly affect the conformation
of the resilin module. This was proven by previous QCM-D studies that
have shown a conformational change from a globular structure at pH
5 to an extended coiled structure at pH 11 where a stronger protein–water
interaction is observed, forming a relatively soft layer of the extended
coil or brushlike conformations.45 However,
this is not directly related to the measured force, namely, the rupture
force of the hydrophobins. One possibility for higher rupture forces
is the simultaneous attachment of several hydrophobins on the tip
surface (Figure 6C),
possibly because of the entanglement of the RLP linkers. Earlier studies
show similar observations where the higher forces were considered
to be related to the detachment of two or few more molecules on the
tip–surface contact.44 The AFM topography
image of the dCBM–RLP–HFBI layer at pH 11 shows a softer
surface and increased roughness that indicates that the molecules
are protruding in more extended conformation which may lead to entangled
brushlike structures (Figure 5D), which makes it less probable to obtain attachment of the
individual molecule to the AFM tip. The shape of the distribution
of the rupture force values for dCBM–RLP–HFBI at pH
11 (red bars in Figure 3A) also hints at an overlay of at least two or three distributions
(with mean values as approximately on time, two times and
three times the mean rupture force of dCBM–RLP–HFBI
at pH 5). It is also known that the resilin and other structure-forming
proteins go through a precursor conformation as a part of self-assembly,
leading to the formation of filaments or other structures with higher
order.35 The tendency toward such structural
transformation may explain the strong mutual interactions and entanglement.

On the basis of the force curves alone, it is very difficult to
draw a definite conclusion which of the attachments are breaking in
the experiment but there are factors that point toward certain events:
first of all, on the basis of the rupture forces measured, it can
be safely assumed that the polypeptide backbone of the protein does
not break but the molecule detaches from one of the interfaces, either
dCBM/cellulose or HFBI/OTS-Si. Second, the fact that the binding forces
at pH 5 are on a similar level for both the proteins indicates that
the linker region does not play a significant role in the attachment
to the surface. Third, the reason for assuming that the dCBM has stronger
adherence is found in the success of the repeated approach/retraction
cycles. If the dCBM had been detached, this would have led to continuous
picking up of molecules on the tip in each cycle. Moreover, the attachment
of the tip-bound molecule on the cellulose surface may have been sterically
hindered by the other molecules occupying the surface. Because neither
accumulation of the molecules on the probe nor steric hindrance was
observed, but the cycling of single-molecule attachment/detachment
could be repeated, it is very likely that really the detachment of
the HFBI was measured.

The energy needed for the rupture of
the molecules was quantified
as the work of rupture. The differences between the studied fusion
proteins and the resilin conformation are clearly observed in the
work of rupture histograms in Figure 3D. Resilin at pH 11 has a very wide distribution of
the work of rupture that extends to 10 000kT range, whereas at pH 5, the values are in 1000kT range. It is obvious that the resilin linker requires larger work
to be extended because of its larger extension and also the higher
rupture forces compared to the protein where only the simple linker
can be extended in prior detachment. Even though all the data do not
precisely represent stretching of a single molecule, resilin’s
ability to dissipate energy upon tensile stress is obvious. The resilin
exon I is a very elastic domain having repetitive hydrophilic regions
and a few hydrophobic regions. At pH 5, it appears that the uncoiling
force of the resilin was higher than the rupture force of the hydrophobin.
However, at pH 11, the rupture force exceeded the uncoiling force
and the molecule could be extended to its full length. In earlier
work, it has been observed that at elevated pH, the unordered secondary
structure of the resilin goes through a change toward a more ordered
β turn structure, which could explain the strong bundling.46 The bundling of the extended molecules, on the
other hand, can be the reason for simultaneous attachment of several
hydrophobins to the tip, which is observed as the increased rupture
force.

Elasticity of the Protein Layer
By analyzing the force
curve recorded during the approach, the stiffness of the layer formed
from the cellulose and the proteins can be estimated. The approach
curve represents the indentation of the AFM probe to the soft layer
of the molecules, and the slope at the close proximity to the surface
is a measure of the surface elasticity (Figure 7).47−49

Figure 7 (A) Examples of approach curves on the
cellulose surface at pH
5 (light blue dots) and pH 11 (dark blue small dots). (B) Examples
of approach curves on the HFBI–dCBM layer at pH 5 (blue dots),
dCBM–RLP–HFBI layer at pH 5 (violet small dots), and
at pH 11 (light blue line).

When the protein layer is indented, the slope of the measured
force
curve will change according to the sample stiffness; the steeper is
the slope, the stiffer is the layer. Although there is no remarkable
difference in the slope between the two fusion proteins at pH 5, on
the other hand, the resilin fusion protein layer appears stiffer at
pH 5 compared to that at pH 11, which means that the layer becomes
very soft once the resilin in swollen. As a comparison, the approach
curves on the plain cellulose surface are presented in Figure 7A. The stiffness of the spin-coated
cellulose layer was clearly lower at pH 11 compared to pH 5.

Conclusions
By employing SMFS, modular proteins containing adhesive domains
and elastic linker region were characterized. The focus was on the
mechanical properties of the elastic exon I resilin-like peptide by
having it as a linker domain in between the adhesive units, hydrophobin
HFBI, and double CBM, readily able to self-assemble in between a hydrophobic
AFM tip and a cellulose surface. We could quantify the rupture force
of a single hydrophobin, the molecular dimensions of the studied fusion
proteins, and the work of rupture of the molecules and make observations
on the elasticity of the studied molecular layers. The attachment
of the double CBM on a cellulose model surface appeared to be stable
under the applied tensile stress.

The effect of the pH on the
resilin conformation and its consequences
on the mechanical properties of the protein layers were studied. At
pH 5, the resilin-like peptide was in a random coil conformation and
could not be fully extended by pulling the molecule, whereas at pH
11, full extension of the RLP was obtained. The difference in the
elastic moduli of the RLP layer at random and swollen conformations
was qualitatively confirmed by the AFM indentation. On the basis of
the AFM topography imaging and the SMFS data, at pH 11, the entanglement
of the resilin chains appeared to be strong, which indicates the strong
tendency toward networklike structures. By defining the binding and
elastic properties of these fusion proteins, it has been carried out
as a step forward in the design of hybrid materials.

Materials and
Methods
Proteins
HFBI–dCBM is a recombinant chimeric
protein consisting of two CBMs from Trichoderma reesei, whose production, preparation, and purification is described elsewere.7,9,32 The second construct, dCBM–RLP–HFBI,
contains similar domains and hydrophobins (HFBI) connected together
with a RLP.23,35 The sequences of the proteins
are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S8). The proteins were dissolved in sodium acetate and phosphate
buffers (Sigma-Aldrich).

Production, Expression, and Purification
of the dCBM–RLP–HFBI
Fusion Protein
Synthetic genes encoding Drosophila
melanogaster Rec1-resilin (RLP) and the T. reesei HFBI and CBMs were codon-optimized for T. reesei and synthesized. The T.
reesei CBHII (cellobiohydrolase II; Cel6A) and CBHI
(cellobiohydrolase I; Cel7a) CBMs were separated by a linker (Figure S8). A C-terminal Strep-tag (WSHPQFEK)
was added after the HFBI to the protein to enable detection of the
protein and affinity purification. The synthetic gene fragments were
cloned into an expression plasmid containing cbh1 promoter, secretion carrier and terminator, hygromycin selection
marker, and targeting sequence for the cbh1 locus.
dCBM–RLP–HFBI was expressed as a CBHI carrier protein
fusion with a KEX2 protease cleavage site, NVISKR, between the carrier
and the dCBM–RLP–HFBI protein50 (Figure S9). The ligation mixtures were
transformed into Escherichia coli by
electroporation, and colonies were selected on the kanamycin agar
plates.

The final expression construct pMIs124 was digested
with KpnI-XhoI, and the 10 kb integration fragment was isolated and
transformed into protoplasts of T. reesei strain M658 carrying deletions for extracellular proteases.51,52 Transformed colonies were selected based on the hygromycin resistance
(125 μg/mL) and carried out as described previously.53 Replacement of the cbh1 locus
by the transformed expression construct DNA was confirmed by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) (Table S3). The final
strain was designated M1230.

A T. reesei strain M1230 expressing
dCBM–RLP–HFBI was grown in the 24-well plates in TrMM
plus 40 g/L lactose, 20 g/L spent grain extract, 8.6 g/L diammonium
citrate, 5.4 g/L Na2SO4, and 100 mM 1,4-piperazinedipropanesulfonic
acid at pH 4.5, shaking at 28 °C at 800 rpm (Infors AG). TrMM
contains 15.0 g/L KH2PO4, 2.4 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 4.1 mM CaCI2·H2O, 3.7 mg/L CoCI2, 5 mg/L FeSO4·7H2O, 1.4 mg/L ZnSO4·7H2O, and 1.6
mg/L MnSO4·7H2O. The culture was started
by inoculating 1 × 107 spores into a 50 mL growth
medium. The T. reesei fungus secreted
the dCBM–RLP–HFBI fusion protein into the culture medium.
One liter of culture was grown for 5 days in the 24-well plates (4
mL per well in multiple plates). The growth medium was filtered through
a glass microfiber filter to remove the mycelium, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride was added to the clarified culture supernatant for stabilization.

The fusion protein was purified by aqueous two-phase separation
(ATPS).9 Briefly, to the centrifuged supernatant,
a Triton X-114 surfactant (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration
of 4%. After gentle mixing at 22–24 °C, the solution was
allowed to settle in a separation funnel, where the Triton phase was
separated. Acetate buffer (50 mM NaAc and 40 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, pH 5.0) was added to the detergent phase to a final concentration
of 5% and mixed gently first. After this, isobutanol was added to
the detergent phase, 10 times of the detergent phase volume, and again
mixed gently. The samples from ATPS purification were analyzed by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE,
Gel Code Blue Stain, Pierce) and after blotting to nitrocellulose
filters by western blotting. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat
milk in a TBST buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4)
and then probed with a strep-Tactin AP 35 conjugate (1:2000 in TBST,
IBA Gmbh) followed by chromogenic detection with nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate (Promega). The lower phase from isobutanol extraction was
purified further by preparative reversed-phase chromatography using
a Vydac C4 (20 cm) column and a gradient elution from 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) to 100% acetonitrile (ACN) containing 0.1% TFA acid. After
evaporation of ACN and TFA, the peak fractions were pooled and lyophilized.

The samples in the growth medium were collected from the two culture
wells on days 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the mycelium was spun down. The
supernatant was diluted so that 0.7 μL could be loaded in 20
μL volume per well into a 4–20% Criterion SDS-PAGE gel
(Bio-Rad). After separating the proteins in the SDS-PAGE gel, they
were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a turbo blotter
(Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was done with a mouse anti-Strep tag antibody
(IBA #2-1507-001) diluted to 0.5 μg/mL in TBST. The secondary
antibody was goat antimouse IgG 1:30 000 diluted in TBST (IRDye
680RD goat antimouse IgG; Li-cor #926-68070). The protein standards
(human VEGF receptor 2 protein fragment) were loaded into the gel
corresponding to 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25 ng (Abcam #ab182692). The
membranes were scanned with the LI-COR Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging
System at 700 nm.

The dCBM–RLP–HFBI expression
level in the culture
supernatant was determined to be 260 mg/L on day 5 of the culture
(Figure S10A). The culture supernatant
containing the fusion protein was processed and purified via ATPS
and reversed-phase chromatography and was around >97% pure (Figure S10B). From 1 L of culture supernatant,
60 mg of dCBM–RLP–HFBI was recovered after freeze-drying.

Cellulose Functionalization of the Surface
The cellulose
model surfaces were prepared on the silicon oxide surface by converting
trimethylsilylcellulose (TMSC) into cellulose.54,55 In detail, a 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 piece of silicon oxide
surface was spin-coated with 50 μL of 1 mg mL–1 TMSC56 (purity > 98%, friendly gift
by
Prof. Dr. Thomas Heinze, Friedrich Schiller University Jena) dissolved
in hexane at a spinning speed of 5000 rpm for 60 s. After that, the
TMSC-coated surface was carefully placed under 12 M hydrochloric acid
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 min.

Characterization of the Cellulose Films
Finally, to
investigate the presence of the cellulose layer, both the films of
TMSC and cellulose were characterized by contact angle measurements
(SCA 20, Data Physics), ellipsometry (EP3 Imaging Ellipsometer Nanofilm
Technology, Accurion, Germany), AFM (Bruker, BioFastScan), and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA Lab Mk II photoelectronspectrometer,
by Vacuum Generators, England). The values reported in Table S4 and Figure S11A–D are in agreement with the values given in the literature.57 The cellulose layer had a thickness of 5 nm
in comparison with the thickness of 7.8 nm of the TMSC film. The cellulose
contact angle, however, reveals a higher hydrophilicity for the cellulose
rather than the TMSC (see Table S4). To
choose the most suitable cellulose coating for the experiments, the
cellulose surfaces having concentrations of 10, 5, and 1 mg mL–1 have been prepared and characterized. The thinnest
and most homogeneous cellulose surface was the one prepared from the
1 mg mL–1 solution (see Table S4).

The conversion from TMSC to cellulose upon HCl treatment
is also supported by XPS experiments. In Figure S11A, the C 1s spectrum (Al Kα radiation, h̵ω = 1486.6 eV, take-off angle = 45°, Shirley background
correction) of the TMSC sample displays three prominent peaks that
can be assigned to the photoemission from the C 1s orbital with the
main peak at the lowest binding energy representing an overlap of
carbon bond as C–Si and C–C. The two minor peaks at
higher binding energy can be assigned to the C–O–C and
C–O bonds. Despite a small shift of binding energies (probably
caused by a slight charging of the sample), the spectral shape is
very close to that observed.57 After HCl
treatment, the C 1s spectrum in Figure S11B excels by a strong reduction of the C–C- and C–Si-related
peak intensities, giving evidence that the silyl groups have been
eliminated from the TMSC and that a conversion to cellulose has taken
place. This observation is also in accordance with the previous results
reported in the literature.57

Silanization
of the AFM Probes
Probes based on the
silicon nitride cantilevers with mounted tips have been functionalized
via the silanization reaction. Briefly, the AFM probes were plasma-cleaned
for 3 min. Then, OTS (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a solution of bicyclohexyl
(Acros Organics) and CCl4 (Sigma Aldrich) in a molar ratio
of 479:1, and the probes have been left immersed for 15 min. After
that, the probes were rinsed with chloroform and dried in air. All
of the functionalized probes have been used in the week of the preparation.

Protein Attachment
CBMs have a strong binding affinity
to cellulose so that simply by allowing the proteins spontaneously
adsorb on the cellulose-coated silicon surfaces, it was possible to
create a stable protein layer on the sample. HFBI–dCBM was
dissolved in a buffer solution of 10 mM NaAc at pH 5 for a final concentration
of 0.1 μM, and a 50 μL droplet of the solution was placed
on top of the sample. After 10 min, the samples were carefully rinsed
with 10 mM NaAc to remove the protein that was not adsorbed on the
cellulose. The same procedure was adopted for dCBM–RLP–HFBI.
The cantilever was calibrated in liquid by using the thermal tune
technique.58,59

AFM Imaging
Topographical
images have been recorded
by AFM in the tapping mode with a Bruker Dimension FastScan Bio instrument.
For measurement in air, the images were scanned using silicon cantilevers
(Olympus) with a resonance frequency of 300 kHz and a force constant
of 26 N m–1. The scanned image size was 1 ×
1 μm2. For the measurements in liquid environment,
FastScan-D and SNL cantilevers having resonance frequencies of 110
and 65 kHz, and force constants of 0.25 and 0.35 N m–1, respectively, were used.

Atomic Force Microscopy–Single-Molecule
Force Spectroscopy
Briefly, the SMFS technique is based on
measuring the force between
a cantilever of an AFM tip functionalized with the molecule of interest
and a surface to which the studied molecule has an affinity. The interacting
forces between the protein and the surface cause deflection of the
cantilever, which is measured by the position of a laser beam reflected
by the cantilever on a photodiode. This signal will go to a detector
that will convert it to an electrical response, which is analyzed
in terms of a force/distance curve. Experiments were conducted in
two ways: (1) between the silanized AFM tip and the protein-functionalized
cellulose surface, and (2) silanized surface and proteins on the cellulose-functionalized
AFM tip (see Supporting Information, Figure
S3). The experiments were carried out in buffer at room temperature
with a Bruker Dimension FastScan Bio instrument. Each experiment consists
of at least 500–600 single force/distance curves. The force
measurements were carried out using a z-range of
500 nm, a scan rate of 1 Hz, a spring constant of 0.03 N m–1, and a relative force trigger of 0.1 V. The rupture forces were
evaluated with NanoScope software (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) by calculating
the difference between the force at rupture in the last stretching
event and the baseline for every single curve.59 Baseline correction was carried out using MATLAB software.
The histogram values have been extracted from around 200–300
curves for each experiment. The Gaussian curves were fitted to the
data to obtain mean values and their standard error. When applicable,
multiple peaks were included to obtain a representative overall fit.

Data Analysis
The energy related to the detachment
process as well as the contour length and persistence length of the
molecules was evaluated by comparing the force/distance curves with
the wormlike chain model. This model describes the molecules as semiflexible
polymer chains having a contour length L consisting
of rigid parts having a length P (persistence length).
For the tensile force curve, the model yields eq 1, where T is the temperature, F is the adhesion force, l is the persistence
length, L is the contour length, and z is the extension length. The data in Figure 3B–D are obtained from the curves described
by this equation, which were fitted to the measured data. The work
of rupture was then calculated by integrating the fitted model force/distance
curve until the point of rupture. 1  

QCM-D Measurements
Before functionalization, the QCM-D
gold sensors (Q-Sense; Gothenburg, Sweden) were exposed to UV light
and ozone in an ozonator (BioForce Nanosciences Inc., California USA).
By this treatment, the surface was cleaned from the traces of organic
contaminants and rendered hydrophilic.60 After that, the QCM-sensors were functionalized with TMSC as described
elsewhere.54,55 The sensors were spin-coated
twice with toluene (4000 rpm for 15 s) as a cleaning procedure after
which TMSC was spin-coated at 4000 rpm and an acceleration of 2200
rpm s–1 for 45 s. The TMSC spin-coated films were
then converted into cellulose by exposure to 2 M HCl vapor under vacuum
of −0.1 MPa. Before the experiments, the cellulose-coated QCM
sensors were left to stabilize overnight in water.

The QCM-D
measurements were performed in flow mode using a Q-Sense E4 instrument
(Q-Sense, Sweden). AT-cut quartz crystals, with a fundamental frequency
of 5 MHz, were purchased from Q-Sense. The measurements were carried
out at 22 °C using a flow rate of 100 μL min–1. To obtain information about the stability of the cellulose coatings
and the binding of the HFBI–dCBM and dCBM–RLP–HFBI
proteins on them, the frequency and dissipation changes of the cellulose-coated
sensors during exposure to 0.1 mg mL–1 protein solutions
in 10 mM sodium acetate at pH 5 and phosphate buffer at pH 11 were
measured. Also, the response of a cellulose-coated sensor was measured.
