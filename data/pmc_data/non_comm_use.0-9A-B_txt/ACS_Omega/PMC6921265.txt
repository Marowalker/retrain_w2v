Visible-lightdriven C–TiO2 nanocomposites
were
prepared via a simple calcination and acid etching process. The C–TiO2 nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, and high-resolution TEM. The results showed that
TiO2 nanoparticles were combined with a porous carbon layer
through surface C–O groups, which facilitates the strong interface
interaction. The interface combination of nano-TiO2 and
carbon material increases the specific surface area of nano-TiO2, widens the range of light response, and improves the efficiency
of light-induced electron migration. The visible-light photocatalytic
activity of the prepared photocatalyst was evaluated by the decomposition
of tetracycline aqueous solution. Compared with that of pure TiO2, the photocatalytic activity of C–TiO2 nanocomposites
was significantly improved. Furthermore, a possible photocatalytic
mechanism was also tentatively proposed. This work can promote the
development of active photocatalysts under solar light for the photodegradation
of environmental pollutants.

1 Introduction
In recent decades, more
and more attention has been paid to the
widespread use and abuse of antibiotics, which may have adverse effects
on human health, agriculture, and planting. In antibiotics, tetracycline
(TC) is widely used in human medicine, agriculture, aquaculture, and
other fields.1−3 However, 70–90% of TC is discharged from the
body and ultimately exists in surface water, groundwater, and even
drinking water.4,5 To solve these problems effectively,
several techniques have been developed, such as absorption, photocatalysis,
membrane separation, and electrolysis.6−10 Compared with the traditional technology, semiconductor-mediated
photocatalysis has become a hot spot in the research of antibiotic
residue treatment recently because it is a green and efficient technology.11,12 For the moment, multiple semiconductors have been researched, including
TiO2, SnS2, Bi2O3, ZnO,
V2O5, CeO2, and BiPO4.13−19 Among various photocatalysts, TiO2 is regarded as one
of the most promising materials because of its stability, high activity,
nontoxic nature, and biocompatibility.20 However, its photocatalytic application is still limited due to
its wide band gap and high electron–hole recombination rate.
Several tactics have been devoted to solve these problems, such as
doping, deposition of metals, coupling with narrow band gap semiconductors,
or carbonaceous materials as sensitizers.21−27 Especially note that carbonaceous materials with sp2-hybridized
carbon atoms have been vastly studied due to their tremendous applications
in many fields, such as catalyst supports, adsorbents, and electrode
materials.12,28−32 Therefore, introduction of carbon reflects a simple
strategy, which can reduce the band gap of TiO2 and coincide
with the visible-light spectrum, thus enhancing the photoactivity
of the obtained materials.33 Besides, the
introduction of carbon can promote the charge transfer from the bulk
of the TiO2 structure to the surface area of oxidation
reaction and increase the conductivity of TiO2.34−36 In addition, compared with other hybrid materials, carbon can be
prepared from environmentally friendly raw materials and has the advantages
of stability and low cost.37−39 Moreover, organic pollutants
are easily absorbed into carbon, which is a premise of pollutant decomposition.40 Up to now, several carbonaceous materials including
graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots have been introduced into
TiO2-based composite photocatalysts, which greatly improves
their photocatalytic performance.41−43 Therefore, TiO2–C hybrid materials with a high specific surface area and
high conductivity are expected to become photocatalyst with high activity.

In this study, we demonstrated a facile calcination approach and
acid etching method to synthesize porous C–TiO2 nanocomposites
using the mixture of TiO2, γ-Fe2O3, and starch as a precursor. Herein, porous carbon was used
as a support to disperse TiO2 nanoparticles. In principle,
the porous structure can improve the light-harvesting ability and
the adsorption ability of reactants due to its large specific surface
area and multiple scattering effect. TC was chosen as the targeted
pollutant to determine the photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared
porous C–TiO2 composite catalyst. Compared to that
of pure TiO2, porous C–TiO2 hybrid revealed
excellent TC degradation efficiencies. Furthermore, the stability
of the porous C–TiO2 photocatalyst was investigated
and a possible mechanism was proposed.

2 Results and Discussion
The structures
of the pristine TiO2 and C–TiO2-2 samples
were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy,
and the results are shown in Figure 1a. All of the samples have similar pattern. The diffraction
peaks correspond to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204),
and (116) planes of the tetragonal phase of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272), but there are no peaks belonging to rutile phase;
the diffraction peaks of carbon are not observed in the complex, which
may be due to the low carbon content and relatively low diffraction
intensity. The Raman spectra of C–TiO2 nanocomposites
(Figure 1b) present
the characteristic peaks of both anatase-TiO2 and carbon,
among which the peaks at 144 (Eg(1)), 393 (B1g(1)), 512 (A1g + B1g(2)), and 633 cm–1 (Eg(2)) were attributed to the typical modes of anatase-TiO2,5 and the D-band and G-band of
carbon at 1321 and 1583 cm–1 shifted a little to
1334 and 1599 cm–1 in C–TiO2 nanocomposites
due to the interaction between TiO2 and carbon.39,44,45 In addition, the composition
of the C–TiO2-2 and C−γ-Fe2O3/TiO2-2 nanocomposites was studied by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Figures 1c and S1). The
peaks showed that the C–TiO2-2 product was only
composed of Ti, O, and C elements.

pristine TiO2,
carbon, and C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites. EDS (c) spectrum
of C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites.

The morphological structure of the samples was
examined with transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM). As shown in Figure 2a, carbon has a layered structure and is a thin sheet
with irregular morphology. Figure 2b displays the irregular spheres of the TiO2 particles with diameters in the range of 5–10 nm. The size
distribution profile of the TiO2 particles was described
in detail through photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS; Figure S2), and the results confirm that the
average distribution profile of the TiO2 NPs was 6 nm.
For the C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites (Figure 2c), the TiO2 nanoparticles
are found embedded in the carbon lamellar structure. A typical HRTEM
image of C–TiO2-2 (Figure 2d) identified a crystal spacing of 0.35 nm,
which was assigned to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2. In addition, the PCS results in Figure S2 indicate that the average distribution profile of the C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites is also around 6 nm, which can be ascribed
to the fact that the carbon layer can effectively prevent the agglomeration
of TiO2 at high temperature.46

and (c) C–TiO2-2 hybrid. HRTEM image (d) of C–TiO2-2 nanocomposite.

The full survey spectrum of Figure 3a indicates the presence of titanium (Ti
2p), carbon
(C 1s), and oxygen (O 1s) in the C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites.
In Figure 3b, the Ti
2p spectrum fitted to two peaks at 458.9 and 464.6 eV, which correspond
to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of TiO2,47 respectively. C 1s fine XPS spectra of C–TiO2-2 are shown in Figure 3c. The main C 1s peak for C–TiO2-2 was dominated
by elemental carbon at 284.5 eV, attributed mainly to extensively
delocalized alternant hydrocarbon; the two peaks at 286.2 and 288.6
eV were characteristic of C–O and C=O bonds of carbonate-like
species because of oxidized carbon species, respectively.48 No peak of the Ti–C bond is found in
both Ti 2p and C 1s spectra, which indicates that carbon does not
exist as a dopant in TiO2.49 With respect to the XPS spectra of O 1s in Figure 3d, the O 1s signal was well fitted with three
contributions. The four peaks of 530.0, 530.7, and 532.1 eV should
be ascribed to Ti = O, C=O and C–OH, respectively.50 Valence band (VB)-XPS was obtained to further
investigate the property of the band structure, which can probe the
total density of state (DOS) distribution in the valence band. Figure S3 shows the valence band XPSs of TiO2 and C–TiO2-2. The figure indicates that
the VB edge of TiO2 occurs at 2.74 eV and that of C–TiO2-2 shifts toward negative energy compared with TiO2, which is caused by the contribution of C 2p orbitals.51

In Figure 4a, the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the TiO2 sample exhibits a type IV hysteresis loop according to the
IUPAC classifications, which indicates a mesoporous structure of the
sample, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area was determined to be 77.9 m2·g–1. The pore size distribution of TiO2 calculated by the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and centered at
approximately 28.6 nm (inset of Figure 4a) also confirmed such a microporous structure. The
C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites exhibited a transitional
isotherm from type I to type IV (Figure 4b), which means that micropores and mesopores
coexist in the sample.52 In the range of P/P0 = 0.5–1.0, H3 type
hysteresis loop was observed, which indicated that there were mesopores
in the sample. The quantity of N2 adsorbed can be found
in the low-pressure region, which further proves that there are abundant
micropores, which is attributed to the voids between the deposited
TiO2 nanopariticles. The surface area calculated using
the BET method of C–TiO2-2 was 165.5 m2·g–1, which is much higher than that of TiO2 nanoparticles. Figure 4b inset illustrates the pore size distributions of C–TiO2-2 sample, with the pore center at 1–2 nm, and the
micropore size dominating the distribution. This increaseded porosity
is due to the interaction of synergy and combination, including the
effect of sheet morphology and the CO/CO2 physical activation
in situ induced from the carbonization of starch. There are some mesopores
with pore size of 10–30 nm in the carbon skeleton, which may
be related to the removal of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles.
The remaining voids cause these mesopores to have additional porosity.

To reveal the functions of carbon, UV–vis
diffuse reflectance
spectra (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-prepared
samples were studied in detail. Figure 5a shows the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra
of the pristine TiO2, pure carbon, and C–TiO2-2 samples. As presented in Figure 5a, pristine TiO2 shows only the
basic absorption band in the UV region but no more absorption in the
visible region. Compared with pristine TiO2, the C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites have a wide range of light absorption capacity
in the whole UV–vis region. This phenomenon might be attributed
to two factors: (1) the narrow gap of sp2 carbon cluster
embedded in carbon layers possesses excellent light absorption in
the whole wavelength range and (2) the joint electronic system formed
between TiO2 and carbon could give rise to synergistic
properties.53 As depicted in Figure 5b, PL spectra are measured
at room temperature using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm to study
the recombination process of photoexcited electrons and holes. Apparently,
pristine TiO2 exhibited a high electron–hole recombination
intensity, while significant quenching of PL over C–TiO2-2 was also observed. The results indicated that the combination
of TiO2 and carbon can effectively inhibit the recombination
rate of photoinduced electrons and hole pairs, so as to produce more
active photocatalytic species and improve the photocatalytic performance.
In addition, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of TiO2 and C–TiO2-2 hybrid that is presented as
Nyquist plots in Figure S4 attests that
the addition of graphite carbon can significantly improve the conductivity
of the original TiO2, so as to achieve a rapid interface
electron transfer.54

reflectance and (b) photoluminescence
spectra of the as-prepared samples.

Figure 6a shows
the change of the TC concentration with irradiation time in different
samples. Before illumination, TC solution was adsorbed on different
samples in dark. Obviously, the adsorption capacity of C–TiO2 samples is higher than that of pure TiO2, which
might be ascribed to the graphitic carbon layer (sp2 bonding)
and porous structure of C–TiO2 photocatalysts. The
blank experiment demonstrated that the photodegradation of TC could
be neglected without photocatalyst. With pure TiO2 as a
catalyst, TC concentration decreased gradually after irradiation for
160 min at the rate of 30.4%. After coupling with carbon, the photocatalytic
degradation performance of C–TiO2 samples was greatly
improved. Under the same reaction conditions, the degradation rate
of C–TiO2-2 samples reached 90.8% after irradiation
for 160 min. However, with further increase of carbon content in C–TiO2 nanocomposites, the photocatalytic activity of C–TiO2 nanocomposites decreased rapidly, indicating that the appropriate
carbon content is of great significance for the optimization of their
photocatalytic activity. To obtain a deep insight into the photocatalytic
process, the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics was fitted according
to the equation ln(C0/C) = kt (Figure 6b), where C0 is the initial
concentration of the TC solution, C is the concentration
of TC at time t, and the slope k is the apparent reaction rate constant. The values of the reaction
rate constant (k) are estimated to be 0.00221 and
0.01258 min–1 for pristine TiO2 and C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites, respectively. The rate constant of C–TiO2-2 is up to 5.69-fold higher than that of the bare TiO2. The higher photocatalytic activity of C–TiO2-2 was because its two-dimensional porous carbon layer enhanced the
light absorption region, inhibited the recombination rate of photoelectrons
and holes, and enhanced TC adsorption through the π–π
stacking.55−57 On the other hand, compared to pristine TiO2, C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites showed a lowered ζ-potential
value at pH = 4.5 (Figure S5), which means
a better dispersion of C–TiO2-2 hybrid compared
to that of pristine TiO2 nanoparticles.58 Cyclic experiments of TC degradation in the presence of
C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites were carried out to study
the stability and reusability of the photocatalyst. As revealed in Figure 7, after five cycles
of operation, the photodegradation efficiency of TC did not decrease
significantly, which shows that the C–TiO2-2 photocatalyst
has the advantages of high efficiency, reusability, and good stability
and has potential practical application value in wastewater treatment.

Figure 7 Recycling reaction of TC degradation using C–TiO2-2.

To elucidate the photodegradation pathway of TC
in the presence
of C–TiO2-2, the main intermediate products of TC
transformation in the photodegradation process were identified by
high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS).
The mass spectra of TC after reacting for 60 min by C–TiO2-2 are displayed in Figure S6.
As shown in Figure S6 and Table S1, TC
is completely transformed to seven main photoproducts, which are designated
as P1–P7 in the order of retention time. Combining with these
detection results and references,59−61 degradation and removal
process can be divided into three main pathways (Figure 8). The first pathway is the
primary degradation by the addition of hydroxyl locating at C11a–C12 and C2–C3 double-bond of TC with the attack of the •OH radicals
to generate the intermediate with m/z 475.3, which is further fragmented to the product P2 (m/z 396.9) via the deprivation of methyl from the
tertiary amine and amide group. Meanwhile, TC was oxidized at position
11 to the corresponding ketone to form the product P3 (m/z 453.5), and then the amino group at position
1 was bi-demethylated due to the low bond energy of C–N. Subsequently,
the dehydroxylation reaction occurred at position 2 and then product
P4 (m/z 417.2) was produced. In
addition, the deprotonated product P5 with m/z of 383.2 was generated via loss of N-dimethyl group due
to the relatively low bond energy of C–N and the loss of the
hydroxyl group. Subsequently, the protonated product P6 with m/z 340.3 was generated through the detachment
of amide group from intermediate of m/z 383.2. The detachment of water molecule and hydroxyl group involved
in the formation of protonated products P7 with m/z 306.3. Thus, it can be seen that TC is gradually
decomposed to produce the corresponding degradation intermediates,
which can then be converted into CO2, H2O, and
other degradation products.

Figure 8 Removal pathway of TC over C–TiO2-2 sample.

Based on the above results and discussion, Figure 9 schematically proposes
the possible mechanisms
of the high photodegradation activity of C–TiO2-2
nanocomposites, including photogenerated electron–hole separation
process and free radical formation process. First, the introduction
of two-dimensional carbon sheets result in the C–TiO2-2 sample having a larger specific surface area, thus providing a
more active reaction center. When the as-prepared C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites are irradiated with visible light, the photogenerated
electrons were excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction
band (CB) and then migrate into carbon layers due to the tight coupling
of TiO2 nanoparticles, resulting in the effective separation
of electrons and holes. The separated electrons can react with the
adsorbed O2 to form •O2– for the photo-oxidation
of the TC molecules.5 The remaining holes
in TiO2 can also participate in the redox reactions by
forming •OH radicals.62 Therefore, the photogenerated electrons and holes were efficiently
separated, and the lifetime of the excited electrons and holes could
be prolonged in the transfer process. In summary, the significant
improvement of the photocatalytic activity of C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites is caused by the improvement of solar energy utilization,
the enrichment and adsorption of pollutants, and the subsequent effective
separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the C–TiO2 nanocomposites were successfully
fabricated by a facile calcination approach and acid etching method.
The experimental results showed that C–TiO2-2 nanocomposites
exhibited superior visible-light photocatalytic activity for the degradation
of TC, and the degradation rate was about 5.69 times higher than that
of pristine TiO2. The significant improvement of photocatalytic
activity is attributed to the increase of specific surface area, the
enhancement of light harvesting ability, and the effective separation
of photogenerated carriers. In all, the obtained C–TiO2-2 photocatalyst has potential application in solving the
problems of worldwide environmental pollution and energy crisis by
efficiently utilizing solar energy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Chemicals
Titanium dioxide
(TiO2, 5–10 nm), γ-ferric oxide (γ-Fe2O3, 20 nm), and tetracycline (TC) were supplied
by Aladdin (Shanghai, China) and used without further purification.
Starch was obtained from Alibaba.

4.2 Preparation of Photocatalysts
As
shown in Figure 10, porous C–TiO2 composites were fabricated via
a facile calcination approach and acid etching method using starch
as a carbon source; γ-Fe2O3 sphere acts
as a graphitization catalyst precursor and a hard template. Typically,
2.0 g of starch was uniformly mixed with 0.2 g of γ-Fe2O3 and 4.0 g of TiO2 by a co-ground method.
The resulting powder was then heated at a rate of 3 °C min–1 to reach a temperature of 800 °C and then kept
at this temperature for another 2 h in a N2 atmosphere.
The calcined product was washed with hot 3.0 M HCl solution and deionized
water for several times to remove the iron species and other metal
oxides or salts and dried at 60 °C to get the final C–TiO2 nanocomposites. By varying the amounts of starch, the obtained
C–TiO2 samples were denoted as C–TiO2-1, C–TiO2-2, C–TiO2-3,
and C–TiO2-5 with 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 g of starch
added, respectively. For comparison, carbon was obtained directly
from the carbonization of starch at 800 °C for 2 h.

C–TiO2 hybrids.

4.3 Characterization of Photocatalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a SmartLab
XRD spectrometer (Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation. Then, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the elements of the as-prepared
sample. Raman spectra were collected using a DXR Raman microscope
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., λexc = 532 nm). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were
obtained with a JEM-2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement and XPS valance
band (VB) spectra were performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron
spectroscope (Thermo Fisher Co.) equipped with a standard and monochromatic
source (Al Kα). Particle size distribution test and surface
ζ-potential of the prepared samples were carried out on a Malvern
particle size analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90). The nitrogen
adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K on an ASAP
2020 (Micromeritics). The analysis of intermediates was performed
by a HPLC–MS system (Agilent 1290/6460, Triple Quad MS) equipped
with a Zorbax XDB-C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm2, 3.5 μm).
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were
recorded on a UV–vis spectrometer (UV-3650, Shimadzu) with
an integrating sphere attachment. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were carried out on a CHI920 workstation. The PL
spectra were measured at room temperature on a Shimadzu RF-5301 fluorescence
spectrophotometer with a 325 nm excitation wavelength.

4.4 Photocatalytic Activity
The typical
photocatalytic experiment was carried in a Pyrex reactor with reflux
water at room temperature. The photocatalytic activities of the samples
were evaluated by the degradation of TC under visible-light irradiation.
In a typically photocatalytic test, of the photocatalyst (10 mg) was
added to 50 mL of TC aqueous solution (10 mg L–1), and the suspension was magnetically stirred for 0.5 h in the dark
to establish an absorption–desorption equilibrium before switching
on the lamp. Samples were taken at preselected time intervals using
a syringe and filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) syringe filter to remove particles. The quantitative determination
of TC was analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC,
Shimadzu LC-20A). After TC photodegradation, the catalysts were filtrated
and washed with water. Then, they were added to a photoreactor to
be reused in another TC solution to perform the same photodegradation.
