Silk fibroin powder and biodegradable
polybutylene adipate terephthalate
(PBAT)/poly lactide (PLA) blends were melt-mixed together to fabricate
natural and synthetic polymers as possible new sources of biomaterials.
Morphological observations conducted through scanning electron microscopy
indicated poor dispersion of the silk powder agglomerates, which resulted
from strong hydrogen interactions between silk powder chains in the
PBAT/PLA matrix. Although the silk powder agglomerates decreased the
mechanical properties, as silk powder fractions increased, the ternary
blend with 10 wt % silk powder still displayed high impact strength
of 108 J/m and tensile modulus of 1.2 GPa. On the basis of mechanical
analysis, this blend offered potential applications in fields which
required high impact strength. Blends which contained Joncryl experienced
a decrease in storage modulus. Furthermore, rheological studies confirmed
that the viscosity of the PBAT/PLA/Silk powder blends decreased, which
indicated possible weakening of hydrogen bonds between the silk chains,
caused by the reaction between the epoxy groups of Joncryl. This reaction
provides a possible method to improve the processability of this natural
polymer and to improve its distribution in polymer blends.

Introduction
Biodegradable
polymeric materials have shown promising potential
to replace traditional petro-based plastics in various applications
because of environmental and sustainability concerns. Currently, the
most widely used polymers are synthetic polymers because of their
superior performance such as good mechanical properties, thermal stability,
and processability, either for commonplace plastics or biomedical
applications.1 In the past, research has
been done on creating synthetic-based, biodegradable polymers such
as poly(butylene succinate), but with technology advances, research
has begun to bridge the gap between synthetic biodegradable polymers
and biobased biodegradable polymers.

In recent decades, other
important kinds of biodegradable materials
called natural polymers have peaked the interest of researchers. Natural
polymers were used as consumptive materials because they were naturally
sourced, totally biocompatible, and exhibited good mechanical properties
such as high modulus and strength.2 Compared
to synthetic polymers, natural polymers usually possessed poor thermal
stability because of their low decomposition temperature and poor
melting flowability because of the strong intramolecular interactions
(such as hydrogen bonding). Pretreatment is usually performed on natural
polymers, even though it is typically a rather high-cost process.
To solve the problems previously mentioned, there are various methods
being investigated to take advantage of the processability of synthetic
polymers. These methods include solution or melt blending natural
polymers with synthetic biodegradable polymers directly.

The
successful preparation of vinyl-alcohol copolymers/starch blends
and their commercial application known as Mater-Bi are good examples
of blending modifications.3 Besides starch,
other natural polymers such as collagen, chitosan, silk, elastin,
and cellulose have also been developed and researched for different
kinds of applications.2 Silkworm silk has
been used in textile applications for thousands of years, and now,
silk fibroin macromolecules have been used in the form of films,4 hydrogels,5 foams,6 coating materials,7 and powders.8,9 These materials have been extensively
studied as a possible source of biomaterials for nontextile applications,
demonstrating a potential application in the preparation of biocomposites.4 The literature reported that the three-point
bending strength and modulus for the heat compression silk resins
were found to be 80 MPa and 5.0 GPa, respectively, which were much
higher than those of epoxy and polylactide (PLA).10 Therefore, silk fibroin was also blended with other polymers
such as nylon 6,11 polyvinyl alcohol,12 polyurethane,13 and
poly(acrylic acid)14 to study the interactions
between silk and synthesized polymers. It was expected that these
synthetic polymers would possess improved mechanical properties. The
main disadvantage of these blends was that solutions such as LiBr
aqueous were required because common soluble forms of silk are not
easily obtained.2 Compared to solution
blending, melt blending is more environmentally friendly and cost
effective. However, there is very little research carried out in regards
to the use of these new materials and melt blends of silk with other
polymers because of the poor compatibility and difficulty in dispersion
of the natural polymers.15 In this study,
we blended silk powder with synthesized biopolymers by an economic
melt extrusion method and then explored the compatibility and performance
of these two different biodegradable polymers to address the possible
application of these natural biopolymers.

Natural polymers are
studied extensively in the biomedical fields
such as tissue engineering,16 wound healing,17 and drug delivery.18 Because of the good mechanical, chemical, and biological properties
of natural polymers, blending them with synthesized biodegradable
polymers can broaden their applications in customary fields such as
food packaging19 and commercial films.20 Two important biodegradable polymers, PLA and
polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), were chosen as the matrix
material to blend with silk powder. As one of the biodegradable polymers,
PLA has been widely studied as a sustainable alternative to petro-based
products in commodity applications because of its high mechanical
strength and renewable resource polymerization. However, neat PLA
exhibits inherent brittleness with poor impact and tear resistance.21 PBAT, a biodegradable aliphatic–aromatic
copolyester, exhibits super-tough properties and a nonbreak notched
impact behavior but has a very low tensile modulus.22 PBAT can be used for toughening and improving elongation-at-break
of other biopolymers.23 Therefore, PBAT/PLA
blends were chosen in our study to prepare a matrix with balanced
stiffness–toughness properties.

Former research regarding
the properties of newly developed blends
of natural and synthetic polymers showed that the compatibility between
the silk and synthesized polymers was rather poor.15 In the present study, water-soluble superfine silk powder
with mean size of ∼7 μm was originally blended with commercially
available PBAT/PLA to prepare ternary blends by a melt extrusion process.
The objective of this paper was to identify the melt processability
of natural biopolymers made with silk powder and to evaluate the processability
and compatibility when blended with the synthesized biopolymers. Furthermore,
this paper intended to expand the potential applications of these
biopolymers by economic melt blending method to solve the environmental
concerns caused by the petro-based plastics. The compatibility and
mechanical properties were analyzed to address the key problems and
possible modifications in the preparation of these blends to obtain
a high performance. Investigation on the morphology and compatibility
with and without a commercial compatibilizer, Joncryl ADR-4368, was
carried out to evaluate the structure–property relationship
of the natural/synthesized polymer blends, targeted to improve the
processability and dispersion within this natural biopolymer.

Results
and Discussion
Mechanical Properties and Morphology Observation
The
PBAT60/PLA40 binary blends were prepared in our research as a masterbatch
because of their balanced stiffness–toughness properties. The
binary blends show a tensile modulus of ∼1.3 GPa, elongation
at break of ∼190%, and high notched impact strength of ∼480
J/m without any compatibilizer (Table 1).

The influence of the silk powder contents on the mechanical properties
of the blends is demonstrated in Figure 1. Except for the almost unchanged tensile
modulus, both the tensile and flexure strengths decreased greatly
with the increase of silk powder, as shown in Figure 1. The decreased strength is attributed to
the absence of shear yielding during stretching. The elongation at
break also decreased dramatically, from ∼180 to ∼10%
when 30 wt % silk powders were added. According to former research,
compressed silk powder samples showed a high flexural modulus of 4500
MPa,10 where the flexural modulus increased
slightly in the presence of 20 and 30 wt % silk powders. However,
the flexural modulus of 10 wt % silk powder composites was lower compared
to the blending matrix because the enhancing effect of silk powder
was compromised by the poor compatibility between the matrix and silk
powder at lower silk powder content. Although the matrix (PBAT60/PLA40)
shows high notched impact strength of ∼480 J/m, the impact
strength of the blends decreased to ∼100 J/m even in the presence
of only 10 wt % silk powder, as shown in Figure 1c. The decreased impact strength is the result
of poor compatibility between the matrix and silk powder phases. The
existing silk powder agglomerates in the matrix were believed to be
the cause of weakness in the materials because no linkage existed
in the interface. To check the dispersion of the silk powder in the
blends, the silk powder before processing and surfaces of the impact-fractured
processed blends are observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

The red arrow indicates the fibrils, whereas the red circle indicates
the silk powder agglomerates.

It was observed from the SEM images that the large silk powder
agglomerates were dispersed in the PBAT/PLA matrix, as marked by red
circles in Figure 3. The gap between the PBAT/PLA matrix and silk powder was clearly
observed, indicating the poor compatibility between the two different
polymers (synthesized polymer PBAT/PLA and natural polymer silk powder).
As shown in Figure 3, PBAT60/PLA40 formed a cocontinuous structure because of the close
composition ratios.24 Additionally, the
formation of large amounts of fibrils (as indicated by the red arrow
in Figure 3a) resulted
from the fracture of super-tough PBAT under impact. This greatly contributed
to the high impact strength of the masterbatch. The formation of the
fibrils in PBAT/PLA blends was also observed in the research conducted
by Farsetti.25 With the addition of 10
wt % silk powder, the sample still displayed a tough break, although
the amounts of fibrils decreased compared to that of the PBAT/A40
matrix. The notched impact strength of the blends remained ∼100
J/m because the size of the dispersed silk powder particles was much
smaller compared to the other two samples with high silk powder loadings
and the formation of some fibrils enhanced impact strength. The samples
changed from tough to brittle fractures at 20 wt % silk powder, which
can be seen from the SEM photos shown in Figure 3c. Compared to the uniform dispersed pure
silk powder with size of ∼7 μm, shown in Figure 2, the size of the large silk
powder agglomerate was around 100 μm, indicating the serious
agglomeration of the fillers because of the high hydrophilic properties.
The fracture surface was smooth, and the fibrils which resulted from
the break of PBAT also disappear because of the existing large silk
powder particulates (seen from the enlarged photos in Figure 3c,d). The smooth break surface
cannot consume energy during fracture, leading to the poor impact
strength of ∼35 J/m at 20 wt % silk powder, with only 7% of
the PBAT/PLA matrix.

Because the poor compatibility between
the silk powder and PBAT/PLA
matrix suppressed the mechanical properties of the matrix dramatically,
we introduced a commercial chain extender, Joncryl ADR-4368, to research
the compatibilizer effect on PBAT/PLA and silk powder. Joncryl has
proven to be a good compatibilizer for PLA and PBAT in the former
research.26−28 The effect of Joncryl on the mechanical properties
of the PBAT/PLA binary matrix and 90 wt % matrix with 10 wt % silk
powder ternary blends was researched and the resulting mechanical
properties are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Effect of Joncryl on the mechanical properties of the PBAT/PLA/silk
powder blends: (a) tensile modulus and strength; (b) flexural modulus
and strength; and (c) the notched Izod impact strength and tensile
elongation at break.

The mechanical properties tested show that the introduction
of
0.3 phr Joncryl increased the mechanical properties of the PBAT/PLA
matrix, except for the elongation at break. The notched impact strength
increased with the increasing amounts of Joncryl, likely due to the
esterification reaction that occurred between the polyester hydroxyl/carboxyl
functional groups with the epoxy group in Joncryl. This finding has
been confirmed in our group’s former research.28 The newly formed copolymer could have increased the compatibility
between PBAT and PLA, which may have led to the increased impact strength
which required strong interfacial interactions in the blends. Conversely,
the elongation at break decreased with the increase of Joncryl. The
difference is a result of different break modes under impact (rapid)
and stretch (slow) break. Super strong adhesion at the interface was
necessary for the high impact, whereas the high adhesion was not beneficial
for debonding and matrix yielding, which was required for the high
elongation behavior.29 Less debonding and
matrix yielding would also influence the yield strength during stretching,
leading to the lower yield strength at 0.5 phr Joncryl, as shown in Figure 4a.

The resulting
mechanical properties of ternary blends in Figure 4 show that the modulus
and strength (tensile and flexural) reach the highest values at 0.3
phr Joncryl and then decreased at 0.5 phr Joncryl. This was similar
to that of the PBAT/PLA binary matrix. This means that Joncryl mainly
worked on improving the PBAT/PLA interface rather than the silk powder
and PBAT/PLA interface. Our research also indicated that the impact
strength and tensile elongation at break both decreased even when
Joncryl was introduced into the blends, regardless of the amount added.
The interface between the silk powder and PBAT/PLA was improved minimally.
The smooth and large-sized silk powder agglomerates served as the
weaknesses during the break of the material, which led to the lower
impact strength and elongation at break. This is clearly revealed
by the morphology observation in SEM images, shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 SEM observation of the
compatibilized silk powder/polyester blends
with 0.5 phr Joncryl (impact fracture surface): (A) PBAT/A40/J0.3;
(B) PBAT/A40/10Silk/J0.3; (C) PBAT/A40/J0.5; and (D) PBAT/A40/10Silk/J0.5.
The red arrow indicates the fibrils, whereas the red circle indicates
the silk powder agglomerates.

Compared to that of the PBAT/PLA without Joncryl shown in Figure 3, the interface between
PBAT and PLA was greatly improved with the additional of Joncryl.
The gap between PLA and PBAT becomes an issue as the size of the dispersed
PLA decreases. The gap and decreased dispersed size of the PLA benefit
the macroproperties of the materials by increasing stiffness and toughness.
For the ternary blends, although Joncryl could improve the compatibility
of PBAT and PLA, the dispersed state of the silk powder and interfacial
properties between the silk powder and PBAT/PLA matrix have not improved.
As shown in Figure 5, the amounts of fibril formed in the PBAT/PLA matrix are more prevalent
but large and smooth silk powder aggregates still exist in the ternary
blends even when 0.5 phr Joncryl is added.

Crystallization Properties
Because the crystallization
of the polymer matrix could affect the ultimate mechanical properties
of the blends, the original crystallinity of the molded specimens
was calculated from the curve of the first heating cycle (as shown
in Figure 6). PLA in
all of the blends showed a cold crystallization temperature of ∼90
°C and melting temperature at ∼168 °C. Although the
crystallinity increased with the increasing silk powder contents,
the PLA crystallinity in all blends was still lower than pure PLA,
compatibilized or not. The enhanced crystallinity of PBAT/PLA composites
with increasing silk powder may be caused by the anisotropic nucleation
effect of the silk powder in PLA crystallizations, similar to the
research completed on other fillers.30 In
the case of our ternary blends, the highest crystallinity of PLA is
19.2% [80(PBAT/A40)/20Silk] but the actual value is only 6% for the
composites, when taking the PLA weight percentage into consideration.
A very low crystallinity of PLA in the blends hardly accounts for
the remarkable dependence of impact toughness on the ternary blends.
Except for the first heating, the following cooling and second heating
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves are shown in Figure 7. Pure PLA displayed
a broad crystallization peak located at 93 °C, whereas pure PBAT
shows a sharp crystallization peak at ∼46 °C when cooling
at 5 °C/min. When PLA and PBAT were blended together, a sharp
crystallization peak appeared at ∼78 °C. We suggest that
the blend crystallization peak belongs to the formation of crystals
of PLA and PBAT together during the cooling process. The cold crystallization
and melting peaks of PLA in the blends are depicted in the second
heating curves in Figure 7b,d and both are not influenced by PBAT or silk powder. This
means that the crystal structure of PLA is hardly influenced by PBAT
and silk in our studies.

Structure and Rheological
Analysis
The melt rheology
properties are closely related to chain architecture,31 phase morphology,32 and interfacial
actions.33 It is important to study the
microstructure–process relationship to help understand both
the microstructure and thermal process properties of the polymer.
The changes in the elastic modulus G′, loss
modulus G″, and viscosity of the blends without
the compatibilizer are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Effect of silk powder loadings on the rheological properties
of
the blends: (a) storage modulus; (b) loss modulus; and (c) complex
viscosity

Compared to neat PLA, PBAT shows
higher modulus and viscosity because
of greater chain entanglement. Therefore, the storage modulus, loss
modulus, and viscosity of the matrix for PBAT60/PLA40 were located
in the range between that of the pure PBAT and PLA. It was clearly
observed that G′, G″,
and melt viscosity increased with increasing silk powder contents
over the entire frequency range. This was due to the poor thermal
processability of the silk powder. The silk powder possessed a higher
melt flow temperature than its thermal decomposition temperature,
which greatly limited its processability during blending. Therefore,
it behaved like a reinforcing filler in the melt state, resulting
in increased melt modulus and viscosity.

The effect of compatibilizer,
Joncryl, on G′, G″,
and viscosity of the blends is shown in Figure 9. The storage modulus
and viscosity of PBAT/PLA/Joncryl are displayed in Figure 9a,c. The incorporation of Joncryl
led to increased moduli and viscosity for PBAT/PLA blends, especially
with 0.5 phr Joncryl. This could be attributed to the possible formation
of a PLA/PBAT copolymer in the presence of Joncryl by a reaction during
the melt blending process, as indicated in Figure 10. The same behavior was also reported in
the previous research.26,34 However, unlike the PBAT/PLA/Joncryl
blends, our PBAT/PLA/silk powder/Joncryl composites showed entirely
different rheological properties at 180 °C. The effect of Joncryl
on the storage modulus and viscosity of PBAT/PLA/silk ternary blends
is depicted in Figure 9b,c, respectively. It is interesting to find that the storage modulus
and viscosity decreased with the addition of Joncryl. An investigation
on the structure of silk fibroin by Marsh et al.35 demonstrated that the chains were tightly packed together
by lateral hydrogen bonds, which may cause the poor melt processability.
In our case, except for the compatibilizer effect on PLA and PBAT,
Joncryl may have also interacted with silk powder to destroy the hydrogen
bond of the silk chains, leading to the increased flowability of the
silk powder. With 0.3 phr Joncryl, the modulus and viscosity of PBAT/PLA/Joncryl
blends showed no difference to those of blends without Joncryl, meaning
that the compatibilizer effect was limited with low Joncryl content.
With 10 wt % silk powder, the weaker hydrogen bonding resulted from
the presence of Joncryl, which led to the lowest modulus and viscosity.
The modulus and viscosity in the presence of 0.5 phr Joncryl increased
slightly because of the competition between the compatibilization
and weaker hydrogen bonding effect. The weaker hydrogen bonding caused
by Joncryl could benefit the melt processing of this natural polymer,
such as the increased melt flow index (MFI) values of the final blends
(Figure 9d).

ternary blends: (a) storage modulus; (b) loss modulus; (c) complex
viscosity; and (d) MFI values of the representative samples

Conclusions
A natural biopolymer, silk powder, was
introduced into synthesized
polymer blends of PBAT/PLA by a melt blending method to increase the
biocontent of the final material while maintaining the biodegradable
properties. A common compatibilizer used with PLA and PBAT blends
is Joncryl. Joncryl was added into the PBAT/PLA/silk powder blends
to conduct a compatibilization evaluation. The large difference in
the polar properties between the natural silk powder and biomaterials
PBAT/PLA led to the poor dispersion of silk powder in the blends.
The addition of silk powder into PBAT/PLA blends disrupted the integrity
of the matrix and no linkage was established at the interface; consequently,
the mechanical properties of the blends declined greatly with increasing
silk powder content. However, the blends with 10 wt % silk powder
still exhibited high notched impact strength of 108 J/m, which indicated
the possible applications with high impact properties for the ternary
blends. The introduction of the compatibilizer may have increased
the performance of PBAT/PLA blends because of the possible esterification
reaction which took place within the biopolymer. The increased melt
storage modulus and viscosity confirmed the compatibilization effect.
However, it was found that Joncryl weakened the hydrogen bonds between
the silk chains instead of inducing the compatibilization effect.
This is possibly a result of a reaction with the epoxy groups on Joncryl
with the polymer. The resulting decreased complex viscosity of the
ternary blends with the incorporation of Joncryl indicated that this
reaction could be used in the future to improve the processability
and dispersion of this natural polymer.

Experimental Section
Materials
PLA was supplied by NatureWorks Co., Ltd.
with the brand name of Ingeo Biopolymer 3251D with a reported MFI
of 35 g/10 min (190 °C/2.16 kg) and relative viscosity of 2.5.
PBAT (EcoFlex, film grade) used in this study was obtained from BASF
Industry Co., Ltd. This polymer is developed for film extrusion, and
blown films with reported MFI between 2.7 and 4.9 g/10 min (190 °C/2.16
kg). Joncryl (ADR-4368, epoxy functional oligomeric acrylic resins)
were also purchased from BASF and used as a compatibilizer. The structure
of Joncryl was depicted in Figure 10 based on the information provided by the BASF company.36 The water-soluble superfine silk powder with
the size of ∼7 μm was provided by KB Seiren, Ltd. The
morphology of the silk powder was observed by SEM and shown in Figure 2. The mean size of
the silk powder is around 7 μm, similar to the value provided
by the manufacturer. PLA and PBAT pellets as well as silk powder were
dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h before melt blending.

Biocomposite
Fabrication
To prepare the PBAT/PLA/silk
powder blends, a masterbatch of PBAT/A40 was first prepared by twin-screw
extrusion (Micro-27, Manufactured by Leistritz Corporation, US) at
180 °C, 100 rpm, followed by blending the masterbatch with different
amounts of silk powder in a microextrusion/injection molding machine
(manufactured by DSM Research, Netherlands) into ASTM standard specimens
at melt temperature of 190 °C and mold temperature of 30 °C.
The injection processing was conducted at filling pressure of 6 bar,
packing pressure of 8 bar, and holding pressure of 8 bar in total
20 s. The masterbatch samples were also prepared in the DSM in same
way to make sure that all of the samples experience the same thermal
history. The blend formulations and code are shown in Table 2. All test specimens were conditioned
for 2 days at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity prior to testing
and characterization

Characterization Methods
Mechanical
Property Tests
The tensile and flexural
properties of the samples were tested on an Instron mechanical testing
(Instron 3382 equipped with an extensometer, manufactured by Instron,
US) system according to the ASTM standards D638 and D790, respectively.
Izod impact testing of notched samples was carried out as per ASTM
D256 by a Testing Machine Inc. (TMI) instrument (Testing Machine Inc.
US). In all mechanical tests, the reported data are the mean and standard
deviation. At least five specimens are tested for each sample.

Rheology
Tests
The rheological behaviors of the composites
were studied using a rheometer (Anton-Paar MCR-302 Instrument). The
frequency-dependent rheology behavior of all of the samples was monitored
at 180 °C, 1% strain under N2 protection. The testing
samples were injected as a disk (diameter: 25 mm, thickness: 1 mm)
shape at 180 °C using a micro 15 cm3 corotating twin
screw compounder and micro 12 cm3 DSM injection molding
machine (manufactured by DSM Research, Netherlands).

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry
DSC measurements
were performed on a TA Q200 DSC instrument under a N2 atmosphere.
First, the samples were heated to 220 °C with a heating rate
of 10 °C/min and maintained at that temperature for 3 min before
cooling to −70 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. After that
the second heating scans were monitored between −70 and 220
°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min for determining the glass-transition
temperature (Tg), cold crystallization
temperature (Tcc), melting temperature
(Tm), and crystallinity (Xc).

The crystallinity of PLA (XPLA) was calculated based on the melting enthalpy (ΔHPLA) at ∼167 °C, cold crystallization
enthalpy of PLA (ΔHcPLA), and the
weight ratio of PLA (WPLA), as illustrated
in eq 1. 1  where
ΔHm′ and ΔHc are the melting enthalpies and cold crystallization
enthalpies of PLA, respectively, ΔHmo is the melting
assuming 100% crystalline PLA (93.7 J/g),37 and wf′ is the weight fraction of PLA in the blend.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy
The morphology of the
blends was observed by Hitachi S-570 SEM with an accelerating voltage
of 10 KV. The fracture surfaces obtained from the notched Izod impact
test were sputtered with gold and characterized by SEM directly.

MFI Tests
The MFI was tested on MFI-2000A Melt Flow
Indexer according to the ASTM D1238. The test was conducted at 190
°C, 2.16 kg.
