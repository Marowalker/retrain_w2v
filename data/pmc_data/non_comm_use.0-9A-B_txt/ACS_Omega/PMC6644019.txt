Magnetic ellipsoidal particles adsorbed
at a liquid interface provide
exciting opportunities for creating switchable functional materials,
where self-assembly can be switched on and off using an external field
[Davies et al., Adv. Mater., 2014, 26, 6715]. In order to gain a deeper understanding of this
novel system in the presence of an external field, we study the capillary
interaction and self-assembly of tilted ellipsoids using analytical
theory and finite element simulations. We derive an analytical expression
for the dipolar capillary interaction between tilted ellipsoids in
elliptical polar coordinates, which exhibits a 1/r2 power law dependence in the far field (i.e., large particle
separations r) and correctly captures the orientational
dependence of the capillary interactions in the near field. Using
this dipole potential and finite element simulations, we further analyze
the energy landscape of particle clusters consisting of up to eight
tilted ellipsoids in contact. For clusters of two particles, we find
that the side-to-side configuration is stable, whereas the tip-to-tip
configuration is unstable. However, for clusters of more than three
particles, we find that circular loops of side-to-side particles become
globally stable, whereas linear chains of side-to-side particles become
metastable. Furthermore, the energy barrier for the linear-to-loop
transition decreases with increasing particle number. Our results
explain both thermodynamically and kinetically why tilted ellipsoids
assemble side-to-side locally but have a strong tendency to form loops
on larger length scales.

1 Introduction
Particles adsorbed at
liquid interfaces occur in a wide range of
soft matter systems from particle-stabilized emulsions and foams,1 to membrane and interfacial proteins,2 to functional surfaces for nanotechnology.3,4 Most of the research in this area has focused on spherical or nearly
spherical particles. However, with advancements in the synthesis of
colloidal particles, particles with other shapes have received increasing
attention over the last decade, including ellipsoids,5−10 cylinders,11−13 cubes,14−17 and so forth. The behavior of such anisotropic particles
at liquid interfaces is even richer than that of spherical particles
for two reasons. First, anisotropic particles can adopt multiple orientations
at the liquid interface.11,13−17 Second, for non-neutrally wetting particles (i.e., contact angle
θw ≠ 90°), the constant contact angle
requirement at the three-phase contact line leads to significant deformations
of the liquid meniscus around the anisotropic particles and hence
strong capillary interactions between particles, even for particles
on the micron scale where capillary forces due to gravity (i.e., so-called
flotation forces) are negligible.5−7,12,15−19

These capillary interactions lead to a rich
variety of self-assembled
structures, a subject that is attracting growing interest, as evidenced
by the number of recent review articles in this area.20−22 By imposing external fields on particles at liquid interfaces such
as electric,23 magnetic,4,24,25 or interfacial curvature,26,27 it is possible to gain further control over the capillary interaction
between particles and hence the self-assembly of particles at liquid
interfaces, opening up exciting opportunities for creating switchable
functional materials for photonic and sensing applications.28 In this paper, we focus on controlling the self-assembly
of anisotropic particles using magnetic fields. In particular, we
focus on magnetic particles with ellipsoidal shape, arguably the simplest
anisotropic shape one can consider. When such particles are adsorbed
at a liquid interface, in the absence of an external magnetic field,
the equilibrium orientation is the side-on state (i.e., long axis
of the ellipsoids parallel to the liquid interface).7 However, recent studies have shown that when an external
field is applied perpendicular to the interface, it is possible to
stabilize tilted orientations of the ellipsoidal particles, and above
a critical field strength, the particles undergo an irreversible transition
to the end-on state (i.e., long axis of ellipsoids perpendicular to
the liquid interface).8−10

In a seminal study, Davies et al. showed using
Lattice–Boltzmann
(LB) simulations that the dipolar capillary attractions that exist
between ellipsoidal particles in the tilted state can be used to create
a simple switchable system where self-assembly can be turned on and
off using an external field.4 Specifically,
Davies et al. considered an ensemble of micron-sized, neutrally wetting
(θw = 90°) ellipsoidal particles at a liquid
interface, where both monopolar capillary forces due to gravity and
quadrupolar capillary deformations due to contact line undulations
are negligible. In the absence of a magnetic field, the system is
in the isotropic state where the side-on ellipsoids are randomly oriented
within the interface. However, when an external field (below the critical
field) is applied perpendicular to the interface, the dipolar capillary
attractions cause the tilted ellipsoids to assemble side-to-side within
the interface, forming so-called “capillary caterpillars”.
Davies et al. also observed that these capillary caterpillars had
a strong tendency to form closed loops of different sizes, suggesting
that dangling ends of the caterpillars are energetically unfavorable.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the rich self-assembly
behavior of this system, some of us performed a follow-up study of
both the capillary interactions and self-assembly of tilted magnetic
ellipsoids.25 Using finite element simulations
based on Surface Evolver,29 we found that
these capillary interactions conformed to the expected 1/r2 dipolar power law in the far field (i.e., large interparticle
separations r) but deviated significantly from the
dipolar power law in the near field (i.e., small r regime), presumably because of the importance of higher-order multipoles
in this regime. We also found that the capillary attraction in the
near field was stronger for particle pairs in the side-to-side configuration
compared to the tip-to-tip configuration, consistent with the findings
of ref (4) where the
tilted ellipsoids preferred to assemble side-to-side. In addition,
we investigated the self-assembly of between 3 and 12 tilted magnetic
ellipsoids using LB simulations and found that these small clusters
had a strong tendency to form closed loops, in excellent agreement
with the observations of the larger-scale simulations in ref (4). However, the energy landscape
for these small clusters was not mapped out as this information is
not available from LB simulations.

An unexpected result in ref (25) is the fact that when
the energy landscape for two tilted
ellipsoids in contact was analyzed using Surface Evolver, it was found
that while the side-to-side configuration was the global energy minimum,
the tip-to-tip configuration was a locally stable metastable state
with an energy barrier between the two states.25 This result is in contrast to both experimental30 and theoretical18 studies of non-neutrally wetting side-on ellipsoidal particles,
where the tip-to-tip configuration is found to be unstable and any particles approaching each other tip-to-tip tend to roll
into the stable side-to-side configuration.

Clearly, despite
the progress made in ref (25), there remain a number
of important open questions regarding the self-assembly of tilted
magnetic ellipsoids that require further investigation. The aim of
this paper is to address these questions by performing a fuller analysis
of the problem. First, we derive analytical expressions for the dipolar
capillary interaction between tilted ellipsoids in elliptical polar
coordinates. The advantage of using elliptical polar coordinates is
that it allows us to effectively include higher-order circular polar
multipoles in our pair potentials so that the resultant analytical
expressions are accurate down to smaller r values.7 Our analytical expression for the pair potentials
also allows us to distinguish between particle pairs in the side-to-side
compared to the tip-to-tip configuration. Second, we use both our
derived pair potentials and Surface Evolver to map out the energy
landscape of particle clusters containing two or more particles. Performing
accurate Surface Evolver simulations for more than two particles is
a nontrivial task, and as far as we are aware, our study represents
the first time that the energy landscape for interfacial clusters
containing more than two three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic particles
has been mapped out in the literature. For two tilted ellipsoids in
contact, we confirm that the side-to-side configuration is the global
energy minimum. However, we also find that the tip-to-tip configuration
is unstable. Interestingly, for clusters of three
particles in contact, we find that circular loops of three side-to-side
particles become metastable, whereas for four or more particles in
contact, circular loops become globally stable, whereas linear chains
of side-to-side configuration particles become metastable. Our study
thus corrects an error we made in ref (25) about the stability of the tip-to-tip configuration
for two-particle clusters but otherwise does not change the main conclusions
of that paper. More importantly, the current study provides deeper
mechanistic insights into the self-assembly results for tilted ellipsoids
found in refs.4,25

Note that our theoretical approach neglects contact line pinning
and hysteresis, although such phenomena could be present and important
in real experimental systems. For example, recent experiments have
shown that contact line pinning plays a dominant role in the adsorption
of anisotropic particles at liquid interfaces.31,32 However, theories neglecting pinning and contact line hysteresis
have proven to serve as useful guidelines for both capillary interactions
and self-assembly of anisotropic particles at liquid interfaces.5,12,17,18 In addition, we believe that contact line pinning is more important
in adsorption because the forces driving the motion are small (and
become smaller and smaller as we approach the final equilibrium configuration
of the particle), whereas pinning is comparatively less important
in our system because we are applying a large external torque on each
particle.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the
configurational
variables describing the collective behavior of multiple tilted ellipsoids
and results for both the capillary interaction and self-assembly of
clusters of two or more tilted ellipsoids. In Section 3, we summarize our key conclusions. In Section 4, we discuss the
theoretical models used to analyze the behavior of the system, including
details of the Surface Evolver model and the elliptical dipole potential.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Configurational Space and
Thermodynamics of
the System
We consider magnetic ellipsoidal particles with
semimajor axis length L/2, semiminor axis length R, and aspect ratio Λ = L/2R, which are adsorbed at an interface between two immiscible
liquids. For convenience, we refer to the top liquid as “oil”
and the bottom liquid as “water” in what follows. The
particles have magnetic dipoles lying along their semimajor axis.
An external magnetic field B is applied perpendicular
to the oil/water interface, which interacts with these magnetic dipoles
and causes the particles to tilt such that their semimajor axes make
an angle θt with respect to the unperturbed interface
(Figure 1a). The value
of the tilt angle θt depends on the magnetic field
strength B.8−10 In what follows, we parameterize
the magnetic field strength by fixing θt to be at
an appropriate value and B plays no further role
in our discussion. For convenience, in what follows, we work with
length and energy units, where R = 1 and the oil/water
interfacial tension γow = 1.

tilted ellipsoidal particle at an oil/water
interface; (b) top-down view of a two-ellipsoidal particle system
and variables used to describe the general in-plane configuration
of the system; (c) top-down view of a mirror symmetric configuration
of a two-ellipsoidal particle system where the particles are essentially
in contact but with an exclusion zone of thickness Δ/2 around
each particle.

We consider micron-scale
particles where monopolar capillary forces
(i.e., flotation forces) are negligible. As we wish to focus on the
effect of dipolar capillary forces in this paper, we assume that all
ellipsoids are neutrally wetting (i.e., contact angle θw = 90°) so that quadrupolar capillary interactions between
particles are absent in the absence of a magnetic field. It is of
course difficult to achieve perfect neutral wetting conditions in
practice in an experimental system. However, the results in this paper
should still apply to non-neutrally wetting tilted ellipsoids provided
the tilt angle θt is high enough so that the amplitude
of dipolar contact line undulations is greater than the amplitude
of quadrupolar contact line undulations. In addition, as we shall
see later, both dipolar and quadrupolar capillary forces tend to align
the ellipsoidal particles in the same way, that is, into the side-to-side
configuration. This again suggests that our results should apply to
tilted ellipsoids that are not perfectly neutrally wetting.

For clusters of two tilted ellipsoids, translational and rotational
invariance means that we require three variables to describe a general
in-plane configuration of the system. We choose these variables to
be the bond angles of each particle θb1, θb2 and the center-to-center distance between the particles r12 as shown in Figure 1b. However, mapping out the entire energy
landscape (i.e., minimum energy as a function of all the configurational
variables) for even such a small system is already computationally
very expensive. We therefore restrict ourselves to considering mirror
symmetric configurations, that is, where θb1 = 180°
– θb2 = θb (see Figure 1c), because dipolar
capillary interaction energies are minimized for such configurations
in polar coordinates.25,39 In addition, because capillary
interactions are attractive for mirror symmetric configurations, the
energy of the cluster is minimized when the particles are in contact.
We therefore set r12 = rc, where rc is the center-to-center
distance between the particles in the mirror symmetric configuration
when they are in contact. The distance rc depends on both the bond angle θb and tilt angle
θt of the two particles, and an analytical expression
for rc(θt,θb) is given by eq A3 in Appendix A. Finally, to circumvent
the numerical issues caused by simulating particles in contact, we
define a thin exclusion zone of thickness Δ/2 around each particle
so that the minimum center-to-center distance between particles is rc + Δ (Figure 1c). In all our calculations, we use Δ
= 0.1R. By varying Δ and extrapolating to Δ
= 0, we estimate that the energies obtained using Δ = 0.1R agree with the contact values to within 2%. Note that
the two-particle configurations shown in Figure 1c are characterized only by the bond angle
θb, with θb = 0° corresponding
to the tip-to-tip configuration and θb = 90°
corresponding to the side-to-side configuration (see Figure 4).

For clusters of three
tilted ellipsoids, an even larger set of
variables is required to describe the general in-plane configuration
of the system, specifically the in-plane position vectors of particle
centers and the bond angle of each particle (see Figure 2a). We can reduce the number
of degrees of freedom from 9 to 6 by invoking translational and rotational
invariance, but even so, a full exploration of the energy landscape
of this system is computationally prohibitive. Following our discussion
of two-particle clusters, we therefore restrict ourselves to considering
configurations shown in Figure 2b, where nearest neighbors in the cluster have mirror symmetric
configurations with a center-to-center distance of rc + Δ. Once again, such three-particle configurations
are characterized only by the bond angle θb, with
θb = 30° corresponding to a circular loop of
three particles and θb = 90° corresponding to
a linear chain of three side-to-side particles (see Figure 5). Finally, we can generalize
the mirror symmetric configuration shown in Figure 2b to n particles, with the
bond angle θb = 90° – 180°/n corresponding to a circular loop of n particles and θb = 90° corresponding to a
linear chain of n particles (i.e., looped and circular
capillary caterpillars, respectively).

a three-ellipsoidal particle system and variables
used to describe the general in-plane configuration of the system;
(b) top-down view of a mirror symmetric configuration of a three-ellipsoidal
particle system, including an exclusion zone of thickness Δ/2
around each particle.

For a given configuration of tilted ellipsoidal particles
adsorbed
at an oil/water interface, the total energy of the system is given
by 1  where γij and Aij are the surface
tension and area, respectively, of the i/j interface (i, j = o:
oil, w: water, p: particle). Note that the above energy represents
the interfacial energy of the system. We have not included the magnetic
dipole–field interactions in the energy because these interactions
are independent of the in-plane particle configurations and hence
irrelevant to our discussions. We have also not included magnetic
dipole–dipole interactions between particles because the primary
focus of this paper is on the effect of capillary interactions on
self-assembly. Using Young’s equation cos θw = (γpo – γpw)/γow, we can simplify eq 1 (up to a constant) to E = γowAow – γow cos
θwApw. Finally, because
we are only considering neutrally wetting particles in this paper
where the contact angle θw = 90°, the total
energy of the system simplifies to 2  

In what
follows, we calculate the interfacial energy of the oil/water
interface numerically using Surface Evolver (see Subsection 4.1) and analytically by
modeling each tilted ellipsoid as an elliptical dipole (see Subsection 4.2).

2.2 Capillary Interaction
We first check
the accuracy of the elliptical dipole potential given by eq 12. In Figure 3, we compare the capillary
pair potential, that is, ΔE(r12) = E(r12) – E(∞), as a function of the center-to-center
distance r12 between two tilted ellipsoids
with Λ = 2, θt = 5°, calculated from eq 12 (solid curves) and from
Surface Evolver simulations in ref (25) (data points), for the tip-to-tip configuration
(blue) and the side-to-side configuration (red). For reference, we
also show the asymptotic circular dipole potential given by eqs 13 and 14 (black dashed curve). For comparison in Figure 3, we used He as a fitting parameter and adjusted He so that the circular dipole potential (eq 13) matches the simulation data at
large r12. This procedure yields He = 0.101R, in good agreement
with the value of He = 0.087R obtained from our single particle simulations (see Subsection 4.2).

Figure 3 Capillary interaction
energy as a function of the center-to-center
distance r12 between two tilted ellipsoids
with Λ = 2, θt = 5°, calculated from the
elliptical dipole potential (eq 12, solid curves) and from Surface Evolver simulations
in ref (25) (data points),
for the tip-to-tip configuration (blue) and the side-to-side configuration
(red). For reference, we also show the asymptotic circular dipole
potential (eq 13, black
dashed curve). Note the sign of the vertical axis.

In the far field (large r12), we see
that the Surface Evolver data for both the tip-to-tip and side-to-side
configurations approach the 1/r122 power law expected for dipoles. However, in the near field
(small r12), there are significant deviations
of the Surface Evolver data from the circular dipolar potential because
of the importance of higher-order circular polar multipoles.25 Specifically, for all particle separations,
the side-to-side configuration has a lower energy compared to the
1/r122 power law, whereas the
tip-to-tip configuration has a higher energy (note the sign of the
vertical axis in Figure 3).

Comparing now the elliptical dipole potential with the Surface
Evolver results, we see that the elliptical potential (eq 12) correctly reproduces the 1/r122 power law in the far field. The
elliptical potential also captures the correct sign for the near-field
deviations from the circular dipolar potential for both the side-to-side
and tip-to-tip configurations. However, the elliptical potential underestimates
the magnitude of these deviations for both configurations, suggesting
that higher-order elliptical multipoles are needed if we want to obtain
quantitative agreement between analytical theory and numerical simulations.
Nevertheless, the elliptical dipole potential (unlike the circular
dipole potential) can correctly distinguish between the near-field
interaction energies for different particle pair configurations and
is therefore a useful tool for studying the energy landscape for particle
clusters.

2.3 Energy Landscape
We next use both
Surface Evolver and the elliptical dipole potential to analyze the
energy landscape for the two-particle configurations shown in Figure 1c. In Figure 4, we plot the energy of two-particle clusters (relative to
the side-to-side configuration θb = 90°) as
a function of the bond angle θb for Λ = 2,
θt = 5°, calculated from Surface Evolver (data
points) and eq 15 with He = 0.087R (solid line). From
our Surface Evolver results, we find that the side-to-side configuration
is the global energy minimum of the system, in agreement with the
results of Davies et al.25 However, unlike
ref (25), we do not
find a local minimum at θb = 0°, that is, the
tip-to-tip configuration is unstable rather than metastable. Our Surface
Evolver results are corroborated by the elliptical polar results,
which also show that the side-to-side configuration is globally stable,
whereas the tip-to-tip configuration is unstable. The results in Figure 4 are also consistent
with our expectation from simple electrostatics, where two in-plane
electric dipoles in the tip-to-tip configuration with both dipoles
pointing in the same direction (the analogue of the tip-to-tip configuration
for capillary dipoles) are unstable and will ultimately collapse into
an antiparallel side-to-side configuration (the analogue of the side-to-side
configuration for capillary dipoles).

Figure 4 Capillary energy of two-particle clusters
with mirror symmetric
configurations shown in Figure 1c as a function of the bond angle θb for
Λ = 2 and θt = 5°, calculated from Surface
Evolver (data points) and the elliptical dipole potential (solid line).

One possible reason for the error
in ref (25) is that
the relation between
the center-to-center distance corresponding to contact and the bond
and tilt angles is calculated via an iterative scheme in ref (25), while in this paper it
is calculated exactly via an analytical formula (eq A3). From our experience, capillary
forces are extremely sensitive to small variations in the minimum
distance between particle surfaces so that even a small truncation
error in ref (25) could
have resulted in a (spurious) weak minimum in the potential. However,
we emphasize that while Figure 4 corrects the error made in ref (25) about the stability of the tip-to-tip configuration,
it does not change the main conclusion of that paper concerning the
global stability of the side-to-side configuration. In particular,
both our results here and those in ref (25) explain why tilted ellipsoids assemble side-to-side
to form capillary caterpillars.

Interestingly, the energy landscape
shown in Figure 4 is
essentially the same as that for two-particle
clusters of non-neutrally wetting side-on (i.e., nontilted) ellipsoidal
particles, where the tip-to-tip configuration is also found to be
unstable, and any particles approaching each other tip-to-tip tend
to roll into the stable side-to-side configuration.18,30 This suggests that if the tilted ellipsoids are not perfectly neutrally
wetting, any quadrupolar capillary forces that are present in the
system will reinforce the tendency of the dipolar forces to align
the tilted ellipsoids side-to-side. We therefore expect that tilted
ellipsoids that are not neutrally wetting will also form side-to-side
capillary caterpillars.

We note that while the Surface Evolver
and elliptical dipole results
in Figure 4 agree with
each other qualitatively, there are significant quantitative discrepancies
between the two. This discrepancy can be attributed to the simplifying
assumptions we made in our analytical treatment. First, only elliptical
dipolar terms were included in our calculation, whereas Figure 3 suggests that higher-order
multipoles should be included to obtain quantitatively accurate results.
Second, our analytical calculations neglected nonlinear effects, such
as large interfacial deformations and moving particle contact lines
(see Subsection 4.2), which could be important for the small particle separations found
in particle clusters. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the qualitative
agreement between our analytical and numerical results in Figure 4 confirms that the
elliptical dipole potential captures the essential physics required
to explore the energy landscape of ellipsoidal clusters.

We
next use both Surface Evolver and the elliptical dipole potential
to explore the energy landscape for the three-particle configurations
shown in Figure 2b.
In Figure 5, we plot the energy of three-particle clusters (relative
to the side-to-side configuration θb = 90°)
as a function of the bond angle θb for Λ =
2, θt = 5°, calculated from Surface Evolver
(data points) and eq 16 with He = 0.087R (solid
line). Note that for three particles, θb goes from
θb = 30° (circular loop of three side-to-side
particles) to θb = 90° (linear chain of three
side-to-side particles). From our Surface Evolver results, we find
that the linear chain configuration continues to be the global energy
minimum. However, the circular loop configuration is now metastable,
and there is an energy barrier between the linear chain and circular
loop states. These numerical results are corroborated by the elliptical
polar results, which show the same qualitative behavior, that is,
linear chains are globally stable, whereas circular loops are metastable.

Figure 5 Capillary
energy of three-particle clusters with mirror symmetric
configurations shown in Figure 2b as a function of the bond angle θb for
Λ = 2 and θt = 5°, calculated from Surface
Evolver (data points) and the elliptical dipole potential (solid line).

Interestingly, the discrepancy
between the Surface Evolver and
elliptical polar results for three-particle clusters (Figure 5) is significantly greater
compared to that for two-particle clusters (Figure 4). The larger discrepancy may be due to many-body
effects which were neglected in our analytical treatment, where we
assumed that interactions were pairwise additive. However, it is known
from the work of Fournier and Galatola on interfacial spherical clusters
that such many-body effects can be significant for clusters.33 However, the qualitative agreement between the
analytical and numerical results in Figure 5 once again indicates that the elliptical
dipole potential captures the essential physics required to explore
the energy landscape of ellipsoidal clusters, even those containing
more than two particles.

Comparing Figures 4 and 5, we see that
the number of particles
in the cluster n has a significant effect on the
relative stability of the tip-to-tip and side-to-side configurations.
In the final part of our discussion, we therefore extend our analysis
to larger n values. In Figure 6, we show Surface Evolver results for the
energy of mirror symmetric configurations containing n particles (i.e., the n particle analogues of Figure 2b) as a function
of the bond angle θb, for n = 2
→ 8 ellipsoids with Λ = 2, θt = 5°.
In order to directly compare the energy curves for different n, each curve is normalized by (n –
1), the number of nearest-neighbor capillary bonds in each cluster.
Note that θb goes from θb = 90°
– 180°/n (circular loop) to θb = 90° (linear chain).

Figure 6 Capillary energy of n particle clusters with mirror
symmetric configurations as a function of the bond angle θb for Λ = 2 and θt = 5°, calculated
from Surface Evolver for n = 2 → 8. In order
to directly compare energy curves for different n, each energy curve is normalized by (n –
1), the number of nearest-neighbor capillary bonds in each cluster.

Interestingly, we see that for n ≥ 4, circular
loops become the global energy minimum, whereas linear chains become
metastable. Indeed, the energy of circular loops relative to linear
chains, Emin, decreases as we increase n (see Figure 7a). These results suggest that dangling ends of linear chains are
energetically unfavorable, providing a strong thermodynamic driving
force for loop formation. In addition, the energy barrier for the
linear chain to loop transition, Emax,
also decreases with increasing n, tending to zero
for large n (see Figure 7b). Furthermore, the bond angle at which
the energy barrier occurs, θbmax increases with increasing n, tending toward 90° for large n (see Figure 7c). These results
suggest that the kinetic barrier for loop formation decreases for
large clusters. Together, the results in Figures 6 and 7 explain why
the capillary caterpillars observed in refs4,25 have such a strong tendency to
form loops both thermodynamically and kinetically.

Figure 7 Key parameters characterizing
the energy landscape shown in Figure 6 as a function of
the number of particles in the cluster: (a) energy of circular loops
relative to linear chains Emin; (b) energy
barrier for the linear chain to loop transition Emax; and (c) bond angle of energy barrier θbmax.

One of the striking features
in Figure 6 is the
collapse of the different energy
curves onto a universal curve around θb = 90°.
This universal behavior can be understood as follows. The parabolic
shape of the energy curves around θb = 90° suggests
that the energetics in this regime is dominated by the elastic energy
required to bend a linear capillary caterpillar.18 Specifically, the curvature of each energy curve at θb = 90° is related to the flexural rigidity of the capillary
caterpillar, which locally is due to the splaying of the ellipsoids
on either side of a capillary bond.18 Because
the energy required to splay each capillary bond is independent of n, we expect all the energy curves to collapse onto a universal
curve when they are normalized with respect to the number of capillary
bonds.

We can rationalize the key features of the energy landscapes
of
the particle clusters by considering the micromechanics of bending
the capillary caterpillars. Starting from the linear chain state at
θb = 90°, as we decrease the bond angle, the
initial rise in energy is due to the elastic energy associated with
bending the linear chain, as discussed earlier. However, as we decrease
θb further, the chain ends eventually “see”
each other. Because the capillary interactions between the chain ends
are attractive, it is energetically favorable for the chain ends to
be in contact to form the looped state. The energy curves therefore
eventually deviate from the parabolic curve as θb is decreased, leading to an energy barrier between the linear and
looped states. However, because the angular “distance”
90° – θb before chain ends come into
contact (or equivalently the degree to which the linear chains need
to be bent locally) decreases as we increase n, the
energy curves peel off from the parabolic regime at larger θb, leading to a larger θbmax and hence smaller Emax as we increase n.

We can also rationalize why Emin decreases
as we increase n as follows. First, we note that Emin is essentially the bonding energy of chain
ends, that is, the energy of chain ends when they are in contact relative
to when they are not. Next, we see from Figure 4 that Emin depends
on the bond angle θb of the chain ends when they
are in contact. Specifically, because Emin is approximately the energy at θb relative to the
energy at θb = 0° in Figure 4, Emin decreases
as we increase θb. Finally, because the bond angle
of chain ends when they are in contact θb increases
as we increase n, this means that Emin decreases as we increase n.

Finally, we discuss the relevance of our calculations to experiment.
Interestingly, both linear and looped caterpillars have been observed
for nonmagnetic, non-neutrally wetting ellipsoidal particles in the
“side-on” state.18,34 With advancements in
materials science, it is now possible to produce anisotropic particles
with embedded ferromagnetic dipoles35 or
superparamagnetic dipoles.36,37 We therefore expect
that it should be possible to synthesize the required magnetic ellipsoidal
particles and experimentally prepare the self-assembled structures
predicted in this paper and in refs (4 and 25). Note also
that for particles on the microscale, the energy barrier separating
the different (locally or globally) stable states in Figure 6 can be very large (∼several
million kT). We therefore expect that the self-assembled
structures formed by tilted ellipsoids may be easily trapped in metastable
states. Indeed, it is observed experimentally that capillary interactions
between anisotropic microparticles typically lead to kinetically trapped
configurations.19,38 Therefore, in order to prepare
self-assembled tilted ellipsoids which are in the ground state, it
may be necessary to apply external fields such as interfacial shear
or controlled sonication to help equilibrate the system.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we have used both analytical
theory and Surface
Evolver numerical simulations to study the capillary interaction and
self-assembly of magnetic ellipsoids, which are in the tilted state
because of the application of an external field. Using a superposition
approximation in the limit of small slopes, we first derived analytical
expressions for the dipolar capillary interaction between tilted ellipsoids
in elliptical polar coordinates. The derived elliptical dipole potential
exhibits the correct 1/r2 power law dependence
in the far field and correctly captures the orientational dependence
of the capillary interactions in the near field. However, there was
only semiquantitative agreement between the elliptical dipole potential
and the numerical results in the near field, suggesting that higher-order
elliptical multipoles need to be included in order to model the near-field
interactions quantitatively. Nevertheless, the fact that the elliptical
dipole potential can correctly distinguish between the near-field
interaction energies for different particle pair configurations demonstrates
that it is a useful tool for exploring the energy landscape of particle
clusters.

Using the elliptical dipole potential and Surface
Evolver simulations,
we next analyzed the energy landscape of particle clusters consisting
of up to eight tilted ellipsoids. For clusters of two particles, we
found that the side-to-side configuration was stable, whereas the
tip-to-tip configuration was unstable. This corrects an error we made
in an earlier study25 where we found that
the tip-to-tip configuration was metastable for two-particle clusters.
For clusters of three particles, we found that linear chains of three
side-to-side particles continued to be the global energy minimum,
but circular loops of three side-to-side ellipsoids became metastable.
Finally, for clusters of four or more particles, circular loops became
the global minimum, whereas linear chains became metastable. We also
found that the energy barrier for the linear chain to loop transition
decreased with increasing particle number. The key features of the
energy landscape can be understood in terms of a competition between
the elastic energy for bending linear chains and the bonding energy
of chain ends. Our results provide a deeper mechanistic insight into
the self-assembly of interfacial magnetic ellipsoids, which we hope
will stimulate further experimental investigations of this system
and open up exciting opportunities for creating responsive functional
materials.

4 Theoretical Methods
4.1 Surface
Evolver
In Surface Evolver,
the relevant interfaces in the system (in our case the oil/water interface
only, see eq 2) are represented
by a mesh of small triangles, and the resultant vertices are displaced
to minimize the interfacial energy subject to appropriate constraints.29 We define the x–y plane of the lab frame to lie along the unperturbed oil/water
interface and the z-axis to be perpendicular to the
interface. Vertices on the three-phase contact line are required to
satisfy the ellipsoid equation given by eq A1. The constant contact angle constraint is
imposed by requiring the surface energies of the three interfaces
meeting at the contact line to satisfy Young’s equation. Specifically,
we set γpo = γpw = 0 and γow = 1 to achieve θw = 90°. Homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions are imposed at the outer boundary of the
simulation box to ensure a flat interface far from the particle clusters.
In order to compare our results to those in ref (25), we consider ellipsoids
with aspect ratio Λ = 2 and tilt angle θt =
5°. Depending on the number of particles simulated (2–8),
we used simulation box sizes ranging from 10L ×
10L to 13L × 13L. The particle clusters were placed close to the center of the simulation
box to minimize edge effects. For computational convenience and without
loss of generality, the z-coordinate of all particle
centers was fixed at zero, while the height of the oil/water interface
was allowed to freely vary relative to the particles. In order to
achieve good numerical accuracy, we used a mesh that had a higher
level of refinement close to the particle. In the last stages of evolution,
we changed the model type from linear to quadratic, which adds vertices
at the midpoints of each edge, followed by further minimization which
allows us to evaluate the areas and energy with high accuracy. Note
that these additional refinements are critical because of the severe
resolution requirements on the finite element mesh in the contact
region for obtaining accurate and converged solutions in our calculations.

4.2 Capillary Interactions in Elliptical Coordinates
In addition to calculating the interfacial energies numerically
using Surface Evolver, we also calculated these energies analytically
by modeling each tilted ellipsoid as an elliptical dipole. For these
calculations, we adopt a particle-centered elliptical coordinate system
(s,t) which is related to the particle-centered
Cartesian coordinate system (x,y) by the transformation 3  where
the t = 0 line and
the x-axis in eq 3 are assumed to lie along the semimajor axis of the
particle. The coordinates (s,t)
are analogous to the circular polar coordinates (r,θ), with 0 ≤ s ≤ ∞ and
0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. However, the advantage of the
elliptical coordinates is that they take into account the aspect ratio
of the particle. Specifically, the parameter α is a metric length
scale that is adjusted so that the locus s = s0 (an ellipse) coincides with the contact line
of the particle. Using eq 3, it is easy to show that for ellipsoids with aspect ratio Λ12 4   5  

Consider two identical tilted ellipsoids
with bond angles θb1 and θb2 and
center-to-center distance r12 as shown
in Figure 1b. Let us
denote the left and right particles in Figure 1b as particles 1 and 2, respectively, and
introduce two elliptical coordinate systems, (s1,t1) and (s2,t2), centered around each of
the two particle centers. The contact lines for particles 1 and 2
are located at s = s01 and s = s02, respectively.
For tilted ellipsoids not acted upon by external forces, the leading
order deformation of the oil/water interface is a capillary dipole.7,12,39 Assuming the deformation of the
oil/water interface is small, by solving the linearized Young–Laplace
equation, one can show that the vertical displacement of the interface
created by each particle is given in particle elliptical coordinates
by7 6   7  where He is the
amplitude of the contact line deformation around each particle, s01 = s02 = s0, and s0 is given
by eq 5. Using the superposition
approximation,7,12,39,40 the total deformation of the interface due
to both particles is given by 8  

For small deformations, the interfacial energy
of the system is
(up to an unimportant constant)12,39,40 9  where
∇h is the two-dimensional
(2D) gradient of h and the integral is taken over
the domain A0, where the in-plane coordinates
of the interface are external to the contact lines of each particle.
On the other hand, the capillary pair potential, that is, ΔE(r12) = E(r12) – E(∞), is
given by41 10  where ∇h1|2 is the 2D gradient of h1 evaluated at the center of particle 2 and Q2 is the capillary dipole moment vector for particle 2
given by 11  n is the outward pointing normal
to the contact line of particle 2 (i.e., s = s02) and  is the length of a line
element on the
contact line. In Appendix B, we evaluate eq 10 analytically, and the
final result for the elliptical dipole potential is 12  where s0 is given
by eq 5 and (s1,t1) are the elliptical
coordinates of the center of particle 2. The expressions for the functions G(s1,t1), L(s1,t1) and the relationship between s1, t1 and r12, θb1, and θb2 are
given in Appendix B.

For r12 → ∞, the factor
in square brackets on the right-hand side of eq 12 asymptotically approaches  so
that the elliptical dipole potential
asymptotically approaches the circular polar dipole potential25,39,40 13  where Hp is the
effective amplitude of the contact line deformation in circular polars,
that is, assuming the contact line to be at r = R. Comparing eqs 12 and 13, the amplitudes He and Hp are thus related
to each other by 14  

The amplitude He depends on the
tilt
angle θt. Consistent with the superposition approximation,
we approximate He(θt)
as the contact line deformation amplitude for an isolated tilted ellipsoid;
this is an approximation because when two ellipsoids approach each
other, the contact line on each particle may move in order to minimize
the total interfacial energy of the system.7 Using Surface Evolver, we obtain He =
0.087R for a single ellipsoid with aspect ratio Λ
= 2 and tilt angle θt = 5°. In this paper, we
use this value for He in our analytical
calculations unless otherwise stated.

We can use the elliptical
dipole potential given in eq 12 to analyze the energy landscape
of the particle clusters considered in Subsection 2.1 analytically. For the two-particle clusters
considered in Figure 1c, the interfacial energy of the cluster (up to an unimportant constant)
as a function of the bond angle θb is given by 15  where the expression for the contact distance rc is given in eq A3. On the other hand, for the three-particle clusters
considered in Figure 2b, assuming that interactions are pairwise additive and using simple
geometry, the interfacial energy of the cluster as a function of θb is given by 16  where the first term on the right-hand side
represents the contributions from adjacent particle pairs in the cluster,
whereas the second term is the contribution from the nonadjacent particle
pair.

APPENDIX A
Derivation of the Contact
Distance rc
In this section,
we derive an analytic expression for rc(θt,θb),
the center-to-center distance between two contacting ellipsoidal particles
with configuration given by Figure 1c (but with Δ = 0) as a function of the tilt
angle θt and bond angle θb. Let
us define the x–y plane of
the lab frame to lie along the unperturbed oil/water interface and
the z-axis to be perpendicular to the interface.
For definiteness, let us focus on the particle on the left in Figure 1c and define the
positive x-axis to point to the right and the positive y-axis to point vertically upward. The surface of this particle
is described by the ellipsoid equation A1  where x″, y″, z″ are the particle frame
coordinates with the origin at the particle center, x″ aligned along the semimajor axis and y″, z″ along the semiminor axis. Denoting the coordinate
of the particle center in the lab frame as R = (X, Y, Z), the particle
coordinates (x″, y″, z″) are related to the lab coordinates (x, y, z) by the transformation A2  that is, to obtain the particle frame, the
lab frame is first translated by R so that the origin
is at the particle center, rotated about the z-axis
by the bond angle θb, and then rotated about the
resultant y′-axis by the tilt angle θt.

The surface normal vector for the ellipsoid is given
by ∇f, where f(x,y,z) is the function given by eq A1 and ∇ is the
3D grad operator in the lab frame. At the point of contact between
the two particles in Figure 1c, the y and z components
of ∇f are zero, that is, . Together with eq A1, this gives us three
simultaneous equations
which we can solve to find the coordinates of the contact point. The
contact distance rc is then just twice
the x contact coordinate. The final result is A3  

APPENDIX B
Derivation of the Elliptical Dipole Potential
In this
section, we evaluate eq 10 analytically to find the capillary pair potential ΔE as a function of the particle separation r12 and bond angles θb1 and θb2 shown in Figure 1b. To simplify our discussion, we first rewrite the interfacial
deformation due to each particle h1, h2 as B1   B2  

Comparing eqs 6 and 7 with eqs B1 and B2, the amplitudes in both sets of equations are related
to
each other by B3  where s0 is given
by eq 5. In elliptic
coordinates, the normal to the reference contact line (s0,t)in eq 11 is B4  and .

To simplify the calculation of eq 10, we first write the gradient and the dipole
moment
vector in the frames of reference (x1′,y1′) (x2′,y2′) aligned with the major axis of each
particle and then rotate the vectors in a frame aligned with the line
joining the centers of the two particles. The rotated frames (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) have centers
separated by a distance r12. Their axes x1 and x2 are parallel
to each other, so the dot product in eq 10 can be obtained readily. The frame (x1′,y1′) is obtained from (x1,y1) upon a counterclockwise rotation by an angle
θb1, and similarly (x2′,y2′) is obtained from (x2,y2) upon a counterclockwise rotation by an angle θb2.

In the (x1′,y1′)frame,
the components
of the gradient are B5  and B6  where  can be obtained by implicit differentiation
of the mapping between Cartesian and elliptic coordinates given by eq 3, namely, B7   B8  

In the (x1,y1) frame, the components of the gradient are B9  

In the (x2′,y2′) frame, the components
of the dipole vector are B10  and B11  

In the (x2,y2) frame, the corresponding
components are B12  

Carrying out the
dot product, the capillary energy can be written
as B13  where B14  and B15  or, more compactly, as B16  where B17  and B18  Inserting eq B3 and s02 = s0 into eq B16, we obtain eq 12.
Finally, we need to express the elliptic coordinates (s1,t1) of the center of particle
2 as a function of r12, θb1, and θb2. The relationship between these two sets
of coordinates can be obtained by noting that B19   B20  

Using these expressions, it is easy to see that t1 can be first calculated from B21  and then s1 is
calculated from B22  

In eq B21, the minus
sign is for 0 ≤ θb1 ≤ π and the
plus sign is for θb1 < 0 or θb1 > π.
