Exfoliated nanomaterials could spur
great interest as a new paradigm
in materials science. Therefore, we have sought organic solvents to
obtain high-quality two-dimensional nanomaterials and enable their
adoption in large-scale applications. However, recent approaches in
liquid-phase exfoliation are based on empirical trial-and-error strategies.
Here, we show that the dispersibility of stacked silicanes is discussed
on the basis of Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs). Using these parameters,
we demonstrate that silicanes can be efficiently dispersed in bromonaphthalene
and can be exfoliated as individual sheets (1–6 nm in thickness
and up to 2 μm2 in area). During the exfoliation
process, the oxidation state of the obtained sheets is affected by
the nature of the solvents. Furthermore, HSPs of the stacked silicanes
are compared with those of graphene and hydrogen-terminated germanane.

1 Introduction
Although
graphene is ultimately excellent in terms of electron
mobility, it is a zero-band gap semiconductor, which means that graphene
is not suitable for use in switching devices. In contrast, silicene
and germanene (allotropes of three-dimensional (3D) Si and 3D Ge)
have been reported as two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors with finite
band gaps.1 Furthermore, their physical
and chemical compatibilities with Si assure the easy hybridization
of their 2D devices and well-established 3D-Si technology. However,
pristine silicene and germanene (with unsaturated dangling bonds)
are prone to oxidation in the ambient atmosphere, necessitating that
pristine silicene and germanene can be synthesized and treated in
ultrahigh-vacuum conditions.2,3 Therefore, silicene
and germanene have not been used in the fabrication of actual devices.

To improve the oxidation resistance of silicene and germanene in
the ambient atmosphere, researchers have developed organo-modified
silicane and germanane, which have covalent bonds without unsaturated
dangling bonds.4,5 Recently, the scalable synthesis
of stacked silicanes without organic modifications has led to the
development of a method for leaching lithium from Li13Si4 alloy.6 In a previous report,7 we reported the Hansen solubility parameters
(HSPs) for hydrogen-terminated germanane (GeH) where we proposed that
HSPs will be useful in developing a method for the liquid-phase exfoliation
of other 2D materials.

In the present study, we explore suitable
solvents to efficiently
exfoliate stacked silicanes. To accomplish this exploration rationally,
we experimentally determined the HSPs of stacked silicanes via dispersibility
experiments of a porous silicon powder in various probe liquids. Through
this investigation, the appropriate solvents for producing stacked
silicanes are identified, which will contribute to the fabrication
of feasible low-cost, high-speed 2D-silicon switching devices.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Liquid Exfoliation
Figure 1 and Figures S2 and S3 show photographs of stacked silicane dispersions
in the probe liquids after 20 min of sonication and after the subsequent
sedimentation procedures (2 h, 1 day, and 2 days). The raw data of
light intensity transmitted through the stacked silicane dispersions
(just below the air–liquid interfaces) and the background intensity
(measured through the probe liquids before the sonication procedure)
were taken from the image data in Figure 1; the results are summarized in Tables S2–S4. The T values
calculated by eq 1 are
also listed in Tables S2–S4.

Figure 1 Photographs
of stacked silicane dispersions in 55 probe liquids
after exfoliation (20 min sonication) and subsequent 2 h sedimentation.

Applying the criterion to divide
the probe liquids into good/poor
solvents, we plotted the HSPs of the good (blue circles) and poor
(red squares) solvents, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a–c represents the HSP plots based on the data
corresponding to 2 h, 1 day, and 2 days of sedimentation, respectively.
The HSP spheres and HSP center values obtained by the SPHERE method
are drawn with the green wire frame and solid green circle in Figure 2, respectively. The
good solvents inside and outside the HSP spheres were plotted as solid
blue circles and open blue circles, respectively, whereas the poor
solvents outside and inside the HSP spheres were plotted as solid
red squares and open red squares, respectively. The good/poor solvents
outside/inside the HSP sphere are deemed as anomalies, likely resulting
from uncertainties in the official HSPs, limitations of the HSP theory
(e.g., insufficient treatment of acid–base interactions), and/or
unexpected experimental errors. Although a considerable number of
anomalies are observed (19, 16, and 13 for 2 h, 1 day, and 2 days
of sedimentation, respectively), the obtained HSP spheres are still
considered useful, as will be discussed later.

Figure 2 HSP plots of good solvents
(solid blue circles: inside the obtained
HSP sphere and open blue circles: outside the sphere) and poor solvents
(solid red square: outside the sphere and open red circle: inside
the sphere) for dispersion of stacked silicane, which are determined
by transmittance values of the dispersions after exfoliation and sedimentation
experiments conducted for (a) 2 h, (b) 1 day, and (c) 2 days. The
obtained HSP spheres are drawn as green wire-frame spheres with HSP
centers of solid green circles.

The HSP values obtained by the SPHERE method are summarized
in Table 1 and Figure 3. The “stacked
silicane
#1”, “stacked silicane #2”, and “stacked
silicane #3” are based on the data obtained after 2 h, 1 day,
and 2 days of sedimentation, respectively. Although the HSPs (especially
δD and δH) of stacked
silicanes #2 and #3 are slightly greater than those of stacked silicane
#1, they are similar to each other. Because the FIT values9 were 0.34–0.48 (where FIT = 1 represents
a perfect fit with no anomaly) as a result of the considerable number
of anomalies, the accuracy of the HSP values should be considered
poor. However, the tendency of the HSP terms to be high (extremely
high for the δD term) was consistent for all
of the results; therefore, the exfoliated stacked silicanes must have
high cohesive energy (strong intersheet interactions). In addition,
the HSP values of the stacked silicanes were consistent with those
of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
([δD, δP, δH] = [23, 19, 10] [J/cm3]1/2),8 which can effectively diffuse into CaSi2 and CaGe2 source materials to form bilayer silicene10 and bilayer germanene.11

Comparing
the three HSP terms of the stacked silicanes with those
of graphene (as a 2D-material analog)6,12 reveals that
the δD, δP, and δH values of the stacked silicanes are much larger than those
of graphene. In particular, the δD values for
the stacked silicanes (21–26 [J/cm3]1/2) are extraordinarily large compared with those of common chemical
compounds (15–20 [J/cm3]1/2) composed
mainly of hydrocarbons, oxygen, and nitrogen. The δD value is dependent upon the size of the constituent atoms (i.e.,
atoms larger than carbon, such as chlorine, sulfur, and bromine, lead
to larger δD values)9 as well as upon the molecular size and the atomic
bonding state. More precisely, the δD is correlated
with the polarizability of the functional groups of constituents.13 Although the polarizability values of graphene
and stacked silicanes are unknown, the polarizability values for the
ground-state atoms of carbon and silicon have been calculated to be
1.67 × 10–24 and 5.53 × 10–24 cm3,14 respectively; thus,
the extraordinarily large δD value of stacked
silicanes might be attributable to the large polarizability of the
silicon atom.

The δH value of stacked
silicanes (14–18
[J/cm3]1/2) was larger than that of graphene
(∼7 [J/cm3]1/2). However, these δH values are not extraordinarily large; they are comparable
to the moderately large δH values of hydroxyl
compounds such as alcohols and polyols. This moderately large δH value of stacked silicanes implies that the stacked silicane
surface is partially oxidized and/or hydrolyzed; the surface is therefore
partly terminated by hydroxyl groups. In general, because moisture
in the atmosphere and water in organic solvents function as efficient
oxidizers, the treatment of stacked silicanes in dry air and/or in
dehydrated solvents might be beneficial to achieving a dispersion
of high-quality stacked silicanes without degradation via oxidation
and/or hydrolysis.

Comparing the three HSP terms of stacked
silicanes with those of
H-terminated germanane (as another 2D-material analog),7 we observed that the δD and δH values of the stacked silicanes were
approximately the same as those of H-terminated germanane (which is
thought to be partially oxidized and/or hydrolyzed to form hydroxyl
terminal groups), whereas the δP value for the stacked silicanes
(16–19 [J/cm3]1/2) was slightly larger
than that of H-terminated germanane (11–14 [J/cm3]1/2). This comparison suggests that the stacked silicane
surface has mixed oxidation states of Si=O, Si–O–Si,
and Si–OH, which could result in a higher δP value. Because of this slightly higher δP value for silicon nanosheets, good solvents for exfoliation and
dispersion of stacked silicanes are mostly limited to high-boiling-point
(BP) solvents, indicating that the coating process of stacked silicane
dispersions requires a heat treatment step to evaporate the dispersion
solvent. This point can be a weakness of stacked silicanes compared
with H-terminated germanane (which can be dispersed in low-BP solvents
such as 1,3-dioxolane); therefore, the thermal stability of stacked
silicanes should be assessed to achieve feasible stacked silicane-based
devices.

Figure 4 shows the
dependences of the light transmittance T through
the stacked silicane dispersions on the relative energy difference
[RED = Ra (HSP distance between stacked
silicanes and solvent)/R0 (interaction
radius of stacked silicanes)], where RED = 1 indicates the threshold
to divide good/poor solvents. In all of the results corresponding
to sedimentation carried out for 2 h, 1 day, and 2 days, the RED threshold
does not perfectly divide good/poor solvents; however, a correlation
between the dispersibility and the RED value is apparent [i.e., a
smaller RED (better compatibility in terms of HSP) resulted in lower
light transmittance (better dispersibility of stacked silicanes in
the solvent)]. Therefore, we speculate that the HSP framework still
works well in this system. The large dispersion of data points might
be attributable to the experimental error, that is, degradation via
oxidation and/or hydrolysis, likely resulting from the presence of
a water impurity in the probe liquids (residual concentrations of
water impurities in probe liquids were not controlled in this study).

2.2 Characterization of Stacked Silicanes
Figure 5a,b and Figure S4 show the AFM images of the exfoliated
stacked silicanes obtained using ethanol and bromonaphthalene coated
on a SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrate. Although we could not
determine the tendency of the thickness depending on the types of
probes, the sheet thickness is ∼1–6 nm with flat surfaces
and sharp edges. Based on the thicknesses, the exfoliated sheets were
composed of 3–20 silicon layers (the thickness of one structural
silicon monolayer is ∼0.3 nm). A sheet size histogram of 285
arbitrarily selected flakes demonstrated that the number of frequency
of >50% of seats is lesser than 0.4 μm2 (Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 AFM images
(upper) and the corresponding line profile (lower) taken
along the green line in an upper image. The probes are (a) ethanol
and (b) bromonaphthalene.

To assess the oxidation state of the stacked silicanes exfoliated
with ethanol or bromonaphthalene, we recorded partial-fluorescence-yield
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (PFY-XANES) spectra (Figure 6). The XANES spectrum
obtained from the ethanol dispersion has two peaks at 1842 and 1847
eV, which are assigned to Si–Si and Si–O–Si bonds,
respectively, indicating that the sheet exfoliated with ethanol is
partially oxidized. By contrast, the spectrum of the bromonaphthalene
dispersion has a large peak at 1842 eV and a small peak at 1846 eV,
indicating that the sheet is composed almost entirely of Si–Si
networks, together with a small amount of SiOx. Figure S7 shows a comparison of the
Si K-edge spectra obtained using the PFY and the total-electron-yield
(TEY) modes. The PFY mode is known to be bulk sensitive, and the TEY
mode is known to be a surface sensitive method. As shown in Figure S7, the surface of the sheet exfoliated
with bromonaphthalene has one peak at 1847 eV, indicating that the
sheet is completely oxidized, with no Si–Si bonding (1842 eV).

Figure 6 Si K-edge
PFY-XANES spectra of the stacked silicanes exfoliated
using ethanol (dashed line) and bromonaphthalene (solid line).

To characterize the surface oxidation
state of the stacked silicanes
exfoliated with bromonaphthalene, we analyzed the samples using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which is a surface-sensitive measurement.
The XPS spectrum displayed Si 2p and Si 2s peaks with binding energies
of 101.4 and 152.5 eV (Figure S8), respectively,
which suggests (compared with the peak locations for surfaces of bulk
Si (99.0 eV) and SiO2 (104 eV)) that the surface of the
stacked silicane is partially oxidized. These results are consistent
with the TEY-XANES spectra, indicating that the surface of the sheet
is oxidized but the core retains Si–Si bonds. The surface of
the stacked silicanes is easily oxidized during the exfoliation; therefore,
the small amount of contaminant water in the peeling solvent attacks
the surface of the sheets. Considering abovementioned results, we
propose that although all of the sheet morphologies are similar to
each other, more attention should be devoted to sheet oxidation for
use in the same applications.

3 Conclusions
The liquid exfoliation of stacked silicanes was rationally explored
on the basis of the consideration of their HSPs. The HSPs of stacked
silicanes were determined to be quite large, especially the δD term, which well corresponds to that of an ionic liquid
used to form bilayer silicene and bilayer germanene. The extraordinarily
large δD value of stacked silicanes might be
attributable to greater polarizability of silicon than carbon, whereas
the moderately large δH value suggests the
partial oxidation of stacked silicanes during treatment in the air
and/or solvents, and the slightly large δP value
suggests the presence of Si=O, Si–O–Si, and Si–OH
terminations. Differing oxidation of the prepared stacked silicanes
do not lead to very good fitting in HSP derivation compared to that
of graphene. The FIT values show improvement together with the setting
time, indicating that the precision will improve after leaching the
static oxidation state of the sheets in the various probes. This will
form the subject of future work.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of Porous Silicon
In a
typical stacked silicane synthesis procedure, Li13Si4 crystals were used as precursors, consistent with the previously
reported method.6 The alloys were prepared
by RF heating of Li and Si pieces; thereafter, Li13Si4 was reacted with ethyl alcohol cooled at 0 °C to remove
Li to form the amorphous porous silicon. To crystallize the sample,
the as-prepared silicon powder was heated under vacuum at 500 °C
for 1 h (Figure S1).

4.2 Liquid Exfoliation
The porous silicon
powder (5 mg each) was charged into vials with a capacity of 2 mL,
each of which was filled with 55 probe liquids (2 mL each; their HSPs
are known). The probe liquids were rationally chosen to cover a wide
variety of molecular interactions in terms of HSPs. The vials filled
with the stacked silicane source powder and the probe liquids were
sonicated for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath (liquid exfoliation) and
then photographed after subsequently standing for 2 h, 1 day, and
2 days (sedimentation).

4.3 Characterization of the
Stacked Silicane Dispersions
It was reported that the dispersion
concentration of stacked silicanes
is almost proportional to their absorbance, regardless of sheet diameter
and a probe solvent refractive index.8 In
this report, we did not focus on nanoparticles or rods but on the
nanosheets. Therefore, we used transmittance for estimating the HSP
(see Figure S9, Supporting Information).
The intensity of the light (divided into three primary colors of red
(R), green (G), and blue (B)) transmitted through the dispersions
(IRD, IGD,
and IBD, respectively) and the background
light intensity (IRB, IGB, and IBB, respectively)
were extracted from the image data of the dispersions. The light transmittance T of the dispersions was then calculated using the following
equation: 1  

The T can be transformed
to the absorbance per unit length (A/l), which directly correlates to the concentration of stacked silicanes
exfoliated and dispersed in the probe liquids, via the following equation: 2  

In this
investigation, the light-traveling length l corresponds
to the inner diameter of the vials, which was identical
for all of the dispersions in this investigation, ensuring that the
light transmittance T is inversely correlated with
the concentration of the exfoliated stacked silicanes in the dispersions.
Thus, we categorized the probe liquids for the exfoliation and dispersion
of stacked silicanes into good (T < 0.8) and poor
(T ≥ 0.8) solvents on the basis of the dispersibility
of the nanosheets.

4.4 Calculation of HSPs
The HSP is one
of indicators for molecular interactions. It is an effective tool
to predict and/or examine the compatibility (e.g., dispersibility,
solubility, and wettability) of two different materials.9,15−18 The HSP consists of three terms that originate from corresponding
molecular interactions: δD (London dispersion
term), δP (polar term), and δH (hydrogen bonding term). The compatibility of two different
materials (with respective HSPs of [δD1, δP1, δH1] and [δD2, δP2, δH2]) can
be estimated by the HSP distance Ra, which
is defined as9 3  

A small Ra value
indicates better compatibility of the two different materials.
Because the HSPs of typical organic solvents are already known, the
HSPs of the probe liquids employed in this investigation were obtained
from the official HSP database12 and are
listed in Table S1. To determine the HSP
of a new material whose HSP is unknown (i.e., stacked silicanes in
this case), the SPHERE method has typically been applied.9 In the SPHERE method, experimental compatibility
data (such as dispersibility, solubility, or swelling) of the HSP-unknown
material with respect to probe liquids must be acquired. From the
compatibility data, the probe liquids were divided into “good”
or “poor”, and the poor solvents were plotted in the
HSP space (i.e., a Cartesian coordinate system comprising axes of
δD, δP, and δH). From the HSP plots, a fitting procedure determines the
HSP sphere such that it encompasses the good solvents within the sphere
while excluding the poor solvents. The center position of the obtained
HSP sphere is the HSP value of the objective material. In addition,
the radius of the HSP sphere is referred to as the interaction radius R0, which is a tolerance indicator for the objective
material to interact with other materials.

In the present study,
probe liquids with T <
80% for the exfoliation and dispersion of stacked silicanes were deemed
as good solvents; the HSPs of the stacked silicanes, as determined
from the data after 2 h, 1 day, and 2 days of sedimentation, were
determined by the SPHERE method.
