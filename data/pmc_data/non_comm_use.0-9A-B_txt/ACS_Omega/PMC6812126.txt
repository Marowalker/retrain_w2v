A novel
amphiphilic alternating copolymer with thioether side groups
(P(MSPA-a-EG)) was synthesized through an amine-epoxy
click reaction of 3-(methylthio)propylamine (MSPA) and ethylene glycol
diglycidyl ether. P(MSPA-a-EG) was characterized
in detail by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography,
Fourier transformed infrared, differential scanning calorimeter, and
thermogravimetric analysis to confirm the successful synthesis. Due
to its amphiphilic structure, P(MSPA-a-EG) could
self-assemble into spherical micelles with an average diameter of
about 151 nm. As triggered by H2O2, theses micelles
could disassemble because hydrophobic thioether groups are transformed
to hydrophilic sulfoxide groups in MSPA units. The oxidant disassemble
process of micelles was systemically studied by dynamic light scattering,
transmission electron microscopy, and 1H NMR measurements.
The MTT assay against NIH/3T3 cells indicated that P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles exhibited good biocompatibility. Furthermore,
they could be used as smart drug carriers to encapsulate hydrophobic
anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) with 4.90% drug loading content
and 9.81% drug loading efficiency. In vitro evaluation results indicated
that the loaded DOX could be released rapidly, triggered by H2O2. Therefore, such a novel alternating copolymer
was expected to be promising candidates for controlled drug delivery
and release.

Introduction
In the past decades, various stimuli-responsive
polymeric nanocarriers
have been developed to overcome the disadvantages of traditional chemotherapy
agents, including poor bioavailability, nonspecific selectivity, low
accumulation in tumor tissue, adverse side effects, etc.1−3 Up to now, a wide range of stimuli, such as redox,4,5 pH,6−10 oxidation,11−14 overexpressed enzyme,15 ultrasound,16 magnetic field,17 and light,18,19 have been introduced into polymeric
nanocarriers to achieve the controlled drug delivery and release in
targeted cancer cells while minimizing the toxicity to normal cells.
Among these stimuli, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been widely
used to develop various ROS-responsive polymers for target-specific
drug delivery on the basis of the different ROS content between the
pathological sites and their surroundings.20−24 Usually, there are four ROS including hydrogen peroxides
(H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH·), superoxides (O2–), and peroxynitrites (ONOO–). Among
them, H2O2 is the most major ROS factor in biological
microenvironment. Thus, a lot of H2O2-responsive
polymeric materials have been designed and widely applied in drug
delivery systems for cancer therapy in recent years.25−27 However, most H2O2-responsive polymeric materials
were still prepared through the complicated synthetic process.28−30 Therefore, it is still a challenge to develop a facile synthetic
method of H2O2-responsive polymers.

Alternating
copolymers (ACPs) are an important kind of linear copolymers
with two different structure units arranged alternately in their main
chains and widely used as plasticizing agents,31 chemical sensors,32 photoelectricity,33,34 and so on. Recently, Khan et. al. reported a facile method to synthesize
ACPs by the robust, efficient, and orthogonal click chemistry under
mild reaction conditions.35 Our group also
synthesized a serial of amphiphilic ACPs through the click reactions
of amine-epoxy/amine-thiol and the obtained ACPs could self-assemble
into various architectures, such as nanotubes,36 vesicles,37 and sea urchin like
assemblies.38 In addition, some of them
were used as electrode materials.39,40 Thus, we want
to use this facile method of thiol-epoxy/amine-epoxy click reactions
to further design and synthesize ACPs with excellent biocompatibility
and stimulus-responsive properties for biomedical applications.

Herein, we reported a novel H2O2-responsive
amphiphilic ACP P(MSPA-a-EG) with thioether side
groups that was conveniently synthesized by the amine-epoxy click
reaction from 3-(methylthio)propylamine (MSPA) and ethylene glycol
diglycidyl ether (EGDE) at room temperature. The self-assembly of
P(MSPA-a-EG) in water and the corresponding oxidant
disassemble process were studied in detail by dynamic light scattering
(DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. In addition, we also investigated
the potential of this H2O2-responsive alternating
copolymer as a smart carrier for controlled drug release (Scheme 1).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of P(MSPA-a-EG)
As shown in Scheme 2, P(MSPA-a-EG) was synthesized from MSPA and EGDE
by one-step amine-epoxy click polymerization at room temperature without
any catalyst. The resulting ACP was characterized by NMR, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
techniques. The 1H NMR spectra of EGDE, MSPA, and P(MSPA-a-EG) are displayed in Figure 1A. Compared with their 1H NMR
spectra in CDCl3, the peaks at 2.6 ppm (a), 2.79 ppm (a′),
and 3.16 ppm (b) belonging to the epoxy protons of EGDE disappeared
completely, and two new peaks at 2.5 ppm (a) and 3.83 ppm (b) belonging
to methylene protons (−N–CH2–CH(OH)−) and methyne protons (−N–CH2–CH(OH)−), respectively, appeared
in the 1H NMR spectrum of P(MSPA-a-EG).
The peak at 1.47 ppm (5) belonging to the amine protons of MSPA also
disappeared completely in the 1H NMR spectrum of P(MSPA-a-EG). Furthermore, the peak area integral ratio (Sb/Sd/Sc/S2+4+a/S1/S3) of all protons in P(MSPA-a-EG) was approximately equal to its theoretical value of
2:4:4:8:3:2, which also confirmed the chemical structure of the resulting
alternating copolymer. In addition, the 13C NMR spectrum
of P(MSPA-a-EG) in Figure 1B further verified its chemical structure.
The GPC curve, FTIR spectrum, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve,
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve of P(MSPA-a-EG) are shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2A, the number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of P(MSPA-a-EG) were 2110 and 2.66, respectively, which indicated that the amine-epoxy
click polymerization was successful. The FTIR spectrum of P(MSPA-a-EG) is exhibited in Figure 2B. The strong broad peak at 3382 cm–1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of −OH, which
indicated that strong multiple hydrogen bonds would form among these
hydroxyl groups.41 The peaks at 2903 and
2846 cm–1 could be ascribed to the asymmetric and
symmetric stretching vibrations of −CH2–
respectively. The peak at 1447 cm–1 belonged to
the bending vibration of −CH2–. The strong
peak at 1110 cm–1 was assigned to the stretching
vibration of C–O. The thermal properties of P(MSPA-a-EG) were studied by TGA and DSC measurements, and the
results are shown in Figure 2C,D. The thermal stability of P(MSPA-a-EG)
was relatively high, with the initial decomposition temperature of
around 304 °C (Figure 2C). The glass transition temperature of P(MSPA-a-EG) was about −36.8 °C (Figure 2D). All the above experimental results confirmed
that P(MSPA-a-EG) was synthesized successfully.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of P(MSPA-a-EG) through the Amine-Epoxy
Click Copolymerization
Self-Assembly Behavior of P(MSPA-a-EG)
Based on the amphiphilic structure of P(MSPA-a-EG)
with alternating hydrophobic MSPA units and hydrophilic EG units in
the main chain, it could self-assemble spontaneously in water. The
formation of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was confirmed
by fluorescence technique with Nile red as a fluorescent probe. The
fluorescence intensity of Nile red increased dramatically when the
concentration of P(MSPA-a-EG) increased to a certain
value, which verified the formation of micelles and the encapsulation
of Nile red into the hydrophobic core of micelles (Figure 3A). In addition, the maximum
emission wavelength of Nile red in the P(MSPA-a-EG)
solution exhibited about 26 nm blue shift from 659 to 633 nm when
the concentration of P(MSPA-a-EG) was increased from
3.9 × 10–3 to 0.5 mg/mL (Figure 3B). This further confirmed that the Nile
red was transferred from the water into the hydrophobic environment
as a result of the formation of micelles, which was consistent with
previous report.42 Accordingly, the critical
micelle concentration (CMC) of P(MSPA-a-EG) was calculated
to be about 63.4 μg mL–1 (Figure 3C). The size and morphology
of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles were measured by DLS and
TEM measurements, respectively. As shown in Figure 4A, the DLS curve indicated that P(MSPA-a-EG) was able to assemble into nanoparticles with an average
size of about 151 nm and the particle-size distribution index (PDI)
of 0.249. The TEM image in Figure 4B exhibits that P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles
were spherical with an average diameter of approximately 130 nm, which
was slightly smaller than that measured by DLS. This was attributed
to the dry state of micelles in the TEM measurement but the wet state
of micelles in DLS measurement.

emission wavelength of Nile red in different concentrations of P(MSPA-a-EG) solution. (C) Emission intensity of Nile red versus

micelles.

H2O2 Responsiveness of P(MSPA-a-EG) Micelles
Generally, hydrophobic thioether
groups are easy to transform into hydrophilic sulfoxide groups in
an oxidative environment. Here, H2O2 was employed
as the oxidant to study the oxidation responsiveness of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles. The aqueous dispersions of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles were incubated with H2O2 at various concentrations from 0 to 166.6 mM for 12 h, and the final
photographs are shown in Figure 5A. With the increasing concentration of H2O2, the turbid aqueous dispersions of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles were gradually changed into transparent solutions,
which indicated the disassembly of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles
in the oxidative process. The UV–vis spectrophotometer was
used to detect the transmittance of aqueous dispersions of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles, and the results are shown in Figure 5B. When the concentration of
H2O2 was improved to 22.3 mM, the transmittance
was increased to 98.6%, which confirmed that almost all the micelles
dissociated at this concentration of H2O2. Meanwhile,
the diameter changes of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles with
different amounts of H2O2 were measured by DLS
and TEM. Both results exhibited the disassembly of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles after oxidation. In detail, the diameter
of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles decreased from 151 nm to
6 nm by DLS with the increase in concentration of H2O2 from 0 to 166.6 mM (Figure 5C).

Figure 5 (A) Photographs of (B) transmittance and (C) diameter
changes of
P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles solution after treatment with
different concentrations of H2O2. (D) TEM images
of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles after treatment with different
concentrations of H2O2.

Meanwhile, the TEM images in Figure 5D indicate that the size of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles decreased continuously with the increase in concentration
of H2O2. When the concentration of H2O2 was increased to 166.6 mM, lots of tiny fragments of
several nanometers were observed. The disassembly of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was ascribed to the oxidation of hydrophobic
thioether groups into hydrophilic sulfoxide groups or even sulfone
groups, which endowed the change of P(MSPA-a-EG)
from amphiphilic to hydrophilic.

To further verify the oxidation
of thioether groups into sulfoxide
groups or even sulfone groups, all the above samples were freeze-dried
and then characterized by 1H NMR measurement. As shown
in Figure 6A, the proton
signals at 2.06 and 2.42 ppm belonging to methyl (−SCH3) and methylene (−CH2SCH3) adjacent
to the sulfur atom in the thioether group gradually disappeared with
the increase in concentration of H2O2. Meanwhile,
some new proton signals appeared at 2.59, 2.62, and 1.91 ppm, which
could be attributed to methyl (−SOCH3), methylene (−CH2SOCH3), and methylene (−CH2CH2SOCH3). When the concentration of H2O2 increased
to 22.3 mM, the proton signals adjacent to the sulfur atom in the
thioether groups disappeared completely, which indicated that all
thioether groups were oxidized into sulfoxide groups. The oxidation
extent of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was estimated by
the following equation, and the results are shown in Figure 6B.  The oxidation extent of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was calculated as 22 and 85.3% after treatment
with
H2O2 at concentrations of 2.3 and 8.9 mM, respectively.
Furthermore, the oxidation extent of P(MSPA-a-EG)
micelles reached 100% when the concentration of H2O2 was 22.3 mM or higher. This H2O2-concentration-dependent
behavior was consistent with the results of UV–vis and DLS
measurements.

Cell Cytotoxicity Assay
As a nanocarrier
for drug delivery,
the cytotoxicity to normal cells or biocompatibility is a key parameter
for the biomedical applications of P(MSPA-a-EG).
Thus, the in vitro cytotoxicity of P(MSPA-a-EG) was
evaluated by MTT assay against the NIH/3T3 cell line. The NIH/3T3
cells were incubated with aqueous solutions of P(MSPA-a-EG) at different concentrations from 0.005 to 1 mg mL–1 for 24 h and the results are displayed in Figure 7. Obviously, the cell viability even remained
80.0% when the concentration of P(MSPA-a-EG) increased
to 1 mg mL–1. Therefore, P(MSPA-a-EG) had good biocompatibility and could be used as materials for
drug delivery.

cells after 24 h incubation. The data are presented as average ±
standard deviation (n = 6).

DOX-Loaded and in Vitro H2O2-Responsive
Drug Release
Here, anticancer drug DOX was selected as a
model drug to evaluate the potential of H2O2-responsive P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles as a smart drug
delivery system for drug control release. According to the standard
curve of DOX, drug-loading content (DLC) and drug-loading efficiency
(DLE) of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles loaded with DOX were
calculated as 4.9 and 9.81%, respectively. Then, the in vitro drug
release of DOX-loaded P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was investigated
in pure phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and PBS with 5 or 20 mM H2O2. As shown in Figure 8, the cumulative release of drug from DOX-loaded
P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles in PBS was only about 23.4%
for 24 h. When the concentration of H2O2 was
5 mM in PBS, the cumulative release of drug from DOX-loaded P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was just increased to 31.4% within the same
time. This indicated that a small part of hydrophobic thioether in
P(MSPA-a-EG) was oxidized to hydrophilic sulfoxide
at 5 mM H2O2 and resulted in the partial dissociation
of the micelles. When the concentration of H2O2 in PBS was further improved to 20 mM, the cumulative release of
drug from DOX-loaded P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was significantly
increased to 55.6%, which was ascribed to the rapid dissociation of
P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles under the higher concentration
of H2O2. Thus, H2O2-responsive
drug release can be realized through the transition from amphiphilic
to hydrophilic of P(MSPA-a-EG) on the basis of thioether
groups oxidized to sulfoxide groups. Overall, P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles could be used as a potential biomaterial for drug delivery
and controlled release.

Conclusions
Novel amphiphilic ACP P(MSPA-a-EG) was synthesized
successfully by amine-epoxy click copolymerization of MSPA and EGDE.
H2O2-responsive micelles with an average diameter
of about 151 nm were constructed by the self-assembly of P(MSPA-a-EG). Triggered by H2O2, hydrophobic
thioether groups in the micelle cores were oxidized into hydrophilic
sulfoxide groups and resulted in the rapid dissociation of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles. In vitro cell cytotoxicity assay indicated
that P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles exhibited good biocompatibility
against normal cells. Anticancer drug DOX could be loaded into P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles effectively and realize H2O2-triggered rapid drug release. Such H2O2-responsive ACP P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles based on an
amphiphilic-to-hydrophilic transition would be promising candidates
as smart drug carriers for drug delivery and controlled release.

3-(Methylthio)propylamine (MSPA, 98%, TCI),
Nile red (99%, Acros), 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma), triethylamine (TEA, 99%, Adamas),
acetone (99.5%, Adamas), and ethanol (99.5%, Adamas) were used as
received. Ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) was purchased from
Adamas and purified by distillation under reduced pressure.

Measurements
GPC measurement was performed on an HLC-8320GPC
(TOSOH, EcoSEC GPC System) system at 40 °C with dimethylformamide
as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min–1. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained
on a Varian Mercury Plus 400 MHz spectrometer with deuterium chloroform
(CDCl3) as a solvent at 20 °C. Tetramethylsilane was
used as an internal standard. The DSC measurement was carried out
on a Thermal Advantage DSC Q2000 autosampler (TA Instruments) equipped
with a refrigerator cooling system. The polymer (9.1 mg) was placed
in aluminum pans (nonhermetic) (30 μL) scanned at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1 from −80 to 80 °C
under dry nitrogen atmosphere. The data were treated by using Universal
Analysis 2000 V 4.3 A software from TA Instruments. FTIR spectrum
was recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer by KBr
sample holder method. TGA was measured on a PerkinElmer Q5000IR thermobalance
by using nitrogen as the purging gas at a heating rate of 20 °C
min–1. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement
was performed under a 3,000 HS (Malvern Instruments, Ltd.) equipped
with 125 mW laser light operating at λ = 633 nm with a scattering
angle of 90°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies
was observed under a JEOL 2010 instrument operated at 200 kV. One
little drop of the micelle solution (0.2 mg mL–1) was dropped onto a carbon-coated copper grid. Then, the grid was
immersed into liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried in vacuum at −50
°C before measurement. Fluorescent spectra were measured on QC-4-CW
spectrometer, made by Photon Technology International, Int. USA/CAN.
The excitation wavelength was set at 550 nm, and the emission was
monitored from 570 to 750 nm. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption of the sample solutions was measured at room temperature
by using a Thermo Electron-EV300 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The slit-width was set as 1 nm with a scan speed of 480 nm min–1.

Synthesis of P(MSPA-a-EG)
P(MSPA-a-EG) was synthesized from MSPA and EGDE
as monomers by
the amine-epoxy click reaction. Typically, MSPA (2.613 g, 15 mmol)
and EGDE (1.578 g, 15 mmol) were added into a 25 mL round flask. After
stirring for 48 h at room temperature, the polymer was purified by
dialysis against ethanol for 48 h (MWCO = 3500 g mol–1). By rotary evaporation to remove ethanol, the yellowish viscous
liquid P(MSPA-a-EG) was obtained.

Preparation
of P(MSPA-a-EG) Micelles
Briefly, 10.0 mg
P(MSPA-a-EG) was dissolved in 0.5
mL ethanol completely. Then, the solution was added dropwise into
5 mL deionized water under slight stirring for 10 min. Subsequently,
the solution was dialyzed in deionized water for 12 h (MWCO = 1000
g mol–1), during which the deionized water was renewed
every 4 h. Finally, P(MSPA-a-EG) micelle aqueous
solution was obtained.

Critical Micellization Concentration (CMC)
of P(MSPA-a-EG)
To determine the CMC value
of P(MSPA-a-EG), Nile red was used as a fluorescent
probe. Twenty-five
microliters of Nile red acetone solution (1.6 × 10–4 mol L–1) was added into 4 mL of aqueous solution
of P(MSPA-a-EG) with different concentrations (from
0.00753 to 1 mg mL–1), while the final concentration
of Nile red in each solution was kept at 1.6 × 10–6 mol L–1. Then, the samples were exposed to air
overnight to remove acetone completely. The fluorescence emission
spectra of all samples were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer
at the excitation wavelength of 550 nm.

H2O2-Responsiveness of P(MSPA-a-EG) Micelles
The blank P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles (1.5 mL, 10 mg mL–1) were mixed with
0.5 mL H2O2 solutions at different concentrations.
After treatment for 12 h at room temperature, the appearance and transmittance
of these samples were recorded by using a digital camera and a UV–vis
spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 500 nm. In addition, the diameter
changes of P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was monitored by
DLS. Finally, all the samples were lyophilized and characterized by 1H NMR in CDCl3.

Preparation of DOX-Loaded
P(MSPA-a-EG) Micelles
The typical preparation
of DOX-loaded P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles was as follows:
a predetermined amount of DOX·HCl
and one molar equivalent of trimethylamine (TEA) were dissolved in
1 mL of DMSO solution containing 15 mg of P(MSPA-a-EG) completely. Then, the mixture was slowly added into 8 mL of
deionized water under slight stirring at room temperature for 20 min.
Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a dialysis bag (MWCO
= 1000 g mol–1) and dialyzed against deionized water
for 24 h. To determine the loading amount of DOX, 1 mL of DOX-loaded
micelle solution was lyophilized and then redissolved in DMSO. The
total loading amount of DOX was determined by the UV absorbance of
the solution at 500 nm. The drug-loading content (DLC) and drug-loading
efficiency (DLE) were calculated according to the following equations    Here, Wloaded, Wtotal, and Wpolymer representing the weight of the loaded DOX, total DOX, and P(MSPA-a-EG), respectively.

In Vitro H2O2-Triggered Drug Release
Two milliliters of DOX-loaded
P(MSPA-a-EG) micelles
solution (1 mg mL–1) was transferred into a dialysis
bag (MWCO = 1000 g mol–1). Then, the dialysis bag
was immersed in 30 mL PBS, or PBS with 5 mM, or 20 mM H2O2 in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. At predetermined
time intervals, 3 mL of the external buffer solution was withdrawn
and replaced with 3 mL of fresh PBS, or PBS with 5 mM or 20 mM H2O2. The cumulative released amount of DOX was determined
by using the fluorescence measurement by QC-4-CW spectrometer at the
excitation wavelength of 485 nm. All DOX-released experiments were
carried out in triplicate, and the results are shown as the average
data with standard deviations.

Cell Culture
NIH/3T3
normal cells (a mouse embryonic
fibroblast cell line) were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplied with 10% FBS and antibiotics
(50 U mL–1 penicillin and 50 U mL–1 streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2.

MTT Assay
The biocompatibility of
P(MSPA-a-EG) was evaluated by MTT assay. NIH/3T3
cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at 8 × 103 cells per well in 200 μL of
DMEM. After incubation overnight, the DMEM was removed and fresh DMEM
with P(MSPA-a-EG) at different concentrations (0.005
to 1 mg mL–1) added. The cells without the treatment
were used as control. The cells were incubated for another 24 h. Then,
20 μL of 5 mg mL–1 MTT solution in PBS was
added to each well. After the cells were incubated for 4 h, the DMEM
containing unreacted MTT was carefully removed. Then, 200 μL
of DMSO was added into each well to dissolve the blue formazan crystal,
and the absorbance at a wavelength of 490 nm was measured by a BioTek
Synergy H4 hybrid reader. The blank was subtracted to the measured
optical density values, and the cell viability was expressed as percentage
of the values obtained for the untreated control cells.
