Fullerene
cages are known as being able to participate in radical
initiated copolymerization reactions with vinyl monomers for polymer-functionalized
fullerenes. In this work, poly(N-vinylcarbazole)
(PVK) was selected as a representative of electronic polymers in the
functionalization of fullerene C60 by the same copolymerization
reaction to yield the PVK–C60. Similarly found was
that small carbon nanoparticles could also participate in the same
copolymerization reaction for the nanoparticles to be surface-functionalized
and -passivated by the attached PVK polymers, which are structurally
adhering to the general definition on carbon dots (CDots), thus PVK–CDots.
In the comparison between PVK–CDots and PVK–C60, the former was found to be more absorptive and therefore more effective
in photon harvesting across the visible spectral region and also brightly
fluorescent, orders of magnitude more so than the latter. Similar
to the PVK–C60 and C60 cages in general,
the PVK–CDots exhibited significant photoinduced electron accepting
characteristics and, at the same time, also extraordinary electron
donating abilities that are not available to fullerenes. Because fullerene-based
composites with electronic polymers including PVK have found significant
applications in optoelectronic devices and systems, the prospect of
CDots represented by the PVK–CDots for similar purposes is
discussed.

Introduction
The discovery and development of nanoscale
carbon allotropes began
with fullerenes at the zero-dimension,1,2 then one-dimensional
carbon nanotubes,3−5 and more recently graphenes in two-dimension.6−8 For fullerenes, the widely explored have been polymer/fullerene
nanocomposites,9 including polymer-functionalized
fullerenes and those based on fullerene derivatives such as the popular
methano-C60 derivative 1-(3-(methoxycarbonyl)propyl)-1-phenyl[6.6]C61 (PCBM).10 There have been many
studies in which PCBM and similar fullerene derivatives are dispersed
in polythiophenes and related electronic polymer matrices for the
resulting materials to serve as critical components in photovoltaic
devices and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).11−13 However, the
parent C60 and derivatives are weak absorbers over most
of the visible spectral region and also rather poor emitters in general,
as suggested by results from extensive spectroscopic investigations.14−16 Beyond fullerenes, similarly popular have been the functionalization
and composites of carbon nanotubes and graphenes with the same group
of electronic polymers for a broad range of device and other applications.17−19

Small carbon nanoparticles generally without any defined crystalline
structures have recently been exploited for their effective photon-harvesting
because of broad optical absorptions that are comparable to those
of carbon nanotubes and graphenes,20 with
the harvested photon energies driving some significant excited state
and redox processes relevant to the energy conversion applications.20−22 More importantly, with surface passivation of the small carbon nanoparticles,
the resulting quantum dotlike entities, commonly referred to as carbon
dots (CDots, Figure 1),23,24 have exhibited optical properties and photoinduced
redox characteristics that easily rival those of fullerenes.25−28 Among the large and ever increasing number of studies on CDots already
reported in the literature,27−34 most have been on their bright and colorful fluorescence emissions
that compete in performance with those of semiconductor quantum dots,
including especially their uses as high-performance yet benign and
nontoxic fluorescence probes. The photoinduced redox properties and
processes in CDots have been explored for their serving as potent
photocatalysts,21,35 various components in photovoltaic
devices and LEDs,36−39 and other applications.27,28,40 In fact, as suggested by substantial and growing experimental evidence,
CDots should be considered as another nanoscale carbon allotrope at
the zero-dimension, in addition to fullerenes, representing now a
rapidly advancing and expanding research field.27−34 For potential optoelectronic applications in particular, critical
comparisons between CDots and fullerenes in terms of their functionalization
and composites with electronic polymers and on their associated optical
and redox properties will prove highly valuable.

on CDots, which are generally small carbon
nanoparticles with various surface passivation schemes (by attached
PVK polymers in this work).

In the reported study, poly(N-vinylcarbazole)
(PVK) was selected as representative for its well-known hole transport
function in photovoltaic devices and LEDs,38,41 though the same material configuration and the results and conclusions
should be applicable to other electronic polymers. Specifically, PVK-functionalized
CDots and C60, denoted as PVK–CDots and PVK–C60, respectively, were prepared in the copolymerization reaction
of N-vinylcarbazole with preprocessed and selected
small carbon nanoparticles and C60, respectively. The PVK–CDots
and PVK–C60 were compared for their absorption and
fluorescence emission properties and photoinduced redox characteristics.
The results suggest that CDots could indeed rival fullerenes for applications
benefiting from more effective photon-harvesting and excellent electron
donor, as well as acceptor, functions.

Results and Discussion
A commercially acquired carbon nanopowder sample was processed
for the harvesting of smaller carbon nanoparticles, where the processing
included refluxing in nitric acid, dialysis, and centrifugation to
retain the supernatant as an aqueous dispersion of the targeted nanoparticles.42 The nanoparticles (on average around 5 nm in
diameter according to transmission electron microscopy imaging results
and mostly amorphous without any defined diffraction patterns in the
results from X-ray diffraction analyses)43 were recovered from the dispersion for the copolymerization reaction
with N-vinylcarbazole to obtain the PVK–CDots.
In the synthesis, N-vinylcarbazole and the small
carbon nanoparticles were dispersed in a small amount of dimethylformamide
(DMF) to form a homogenous mixture. Upon the removal of solvent, the
solid mixture was treated thermally for in situ polymerization. The
reaction mixture was dispersed in toluene for purification via repeated
precipitation into diethyl ether and washing with diethyl ether. The
cleaned sample was dispersed in DMF, followed by centrifugation to
collect the supernatant as a solution of the PVK–CDots. The
residue was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine
the content of carbon nanoparticles for mass balance, and the result
suggested that a majority of the starting carbon nanoparticles used
in the in situ polymerization ended up in the PVK–CDots sample.
The optical absorption spectrum of the PVK–CDots in DMF is
shown in Figure 2.
As expected, the visible absorptions in the dots are similar to those
of the aqueous dispersed small carbon nanoparticles (Figure 2), which were known to be responsible
for the photon-harvesting by CDots over the visible spectral region.22

Figure 2 Absorption spectra (enlarged for the 600–750 nm
spectral
region in the inset) of the PVK–CDots in DMF solution (—)
and PVK–C60 in dichlorobenzene solution (- - - -),
both in the absorptivity unit reduced to per mole of carbon, and also
the aqueous suspended small carbon nanoparticles (-·-·-).

As a control, N-vinylcarbazole only without any
carbon nanoparticles was thermally treated under the same conditions,
yielding PVK polymers similar to those acquired commercially. The
PVK polymers are colorless, obviously different from the PVK–CDots
in terms of optical absorptions in the visible spectral region (Figure 2). However, there
was a consideration on the possibility of the PVK–CDots being
a simple mixture of PVK polymers and the dispersed small carbon nanoparticles,
but such a possibility was quickly eliminated by the observed fluorescence
emission properties of the PVK–CDots samples.

Fluorescence
spectra of the PVK–CDots in DMF solution are
shown in Figure 3,
which are excitation wavelength dependent in the same pattern as what
has been observed in many other CDots of different surface passivation
schemes and/or prepared from different synthesis methods.28 Also, similar to the other CDots reported in
the literature,42,44−46 the PVK–CDots
are relatively more fluorescent in the green, with observed quantum
yields of more than 30% at 440 nm excitation for emissions around
530 nm (Figure 3).
The results are comparable with those of CDots in which carbon nanoparticles
are chemically functionalized by small amino molecules such as 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine)
(EDA, thus EDA–CDots) and 3-ethoxypropylamine (EPA, thus EPA–CDots)
under amidation reaction conditions (Figure 3).42,45 Fluorescence decays
of the PVK–CDots are generally nonexponential, also similar
to what have been found for other CDots.26,42,45 The decay curves for 440 and 540 nm excitations
are rather similar, as shown in Figure 4, and they could be deconvoluted by using a biexponential
function. The fitting parameters thus obtained (Figure 4) were used to calculate the average fluorescence
lifetimes ⟨τF⟩ based on the equation
⟨τF⟩ = (A1τF12 + A2τF22)/(A1τF1 + A2τF2).47 The ⟨τF⟩ values for 440 and 540 nm excitations are similar (5.5 and
5.7 ns, respectively), as expected, and they are also comparable with
those of CDots with surface passivation by small organic molecules.42,48

Figure 3 Absorption
spectrum of the PVK–CDots in DMF solution (—)
is compared with those of the EDA–CDots (-·-·-)42 and the EPA–CDots (- - - -).45 Also shown are excitation wavelength dependencies
of observed fluorescence quantum yields (○) and fluorescence
spectra (in the inset, from left to right corresponding to excitation
wavelengths of 400, 440, 480, 520, 560, and 600 nm) of the PVK–CDots
in DMF solution.

Figure 4 Fluorescence decays and
their biexponential deconvolution fits
for the PVK–CDots in DMF solution at 540 nm (A) and 440 nm
(B) excitations are compared with those of the PVK–C60 in dichlorobenzene solution at 540 nm (C) and 700 nm (D) excitations.

The absorption and fluorescence
emission properties of the PVK–CDots
from the thermally induced copolymerization reaction obviously resemble
those of other CDots from different syntheses already reported in
the literature, suggesting that the PVK–CDots must be adhering
to the general definition on CDots,28 with
the small carbon nanoparticles surface-passivated by the functionalization
of PVK polymers. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of
the PVK–CDots is shown in Figure 5, which is apparently dominated by PVK polymers
in the dot sample. The spectral features are very close to those of
the blank PVK polymers supplied commercially and also from the thermally
induced polymerization of N-vinylcarbazole in the
control experiment discussed above (Figure 5). The commercial PVK polymer was specified
by the supplier as having an average molecular weight of about 90 000
Da. Thus, the FT-IR results are consistent with the expectation that
the thermally induced polymerization reaction yielded PVK polymers.
The vinyl stretching mode absorption (around 1650 cm–1) found in the spectrum of N-vinylcarbazole is absent
in the spectra of the PVK–CDots and blanks (Figure 5), again consistent with the
expected polymerization.

Figure 5 FT-IR spectra of N-vinylcarbazole
(A), PVK–CDots
(B), PVK–C60 (C), and PVK polymers from the control
experiment (D) and acquired commercially (E). The spectra appear very
similar because they are all dominated by PVK polymers, suggesting
that no other species of significant IR signals formed in the copolymerization
reactions.

The outcomes of the copolymerization
reaction with the mixture
of N-vinylcarbazole and small carbon nanoparticles
suggest that the nanoparticles are capable of the same behavior found
and established for fullerenes with respect to their similar copolymerization
with vinyl monomers.49−54 For example, C60 could be copolymerized with styrene
and methyl methacrylate in radical polymerization reactions (thermally
initiated or with a radical initiator), yielding copolymers with fullerene
cages incorporated in the polymer structure.49,50,53 Here for comparison, C60 was
copolymerized with N-vinylcarbazole in the thermally
initiated polymerization under reaction conditions similar to those
for styrene–C60 copolymers reported in the literature.50 The outcomes on the formation of copolymers
in which C60 cages are incorporated in the PVK polymer
structure (denoted as PVK–C60) were similar to those
for copolymers of C60 with polystyrene and poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA), including optical properties of the copolymers.51,55,56

The optical absorption
spectrum of the PVK–C60 in dichlorobenzene solution
is also shown in Figure 2. The absorption feature around 708 nm is
characteristic of monofunctionalized C60 cages (commonly
referred to as C60 mono-adducts),14 suggesting the presence of such structural elements in the copolymer.
As also known in the literature,57 mono-
or multi-additions to the C60 cage would result in significant
changes in the optical absorption spectral profile, but hardly any
substantial enhancement in absorptivities over most of the visible
spectral region. The comparison between absorptivities of the PVK–CDots
and PVK–C60 on the per carbon basis (namely molar
carbon atoms in the carbon nanoparticles and C60 cages
in the copolymers) similarly suggests that the former is significantly
more effective in the harvesting of visible photons (Figure 2).

Parent and derivatized
C60 cages are generally weak
in fluorescence emissions14,16,57 and ever weaker in multi-adducts including copolymers with incorporated
C60 cages such as those obtained from radical copolymerization
of C60 and styrene.50,55 Similarly, the PVK–C60 was also found to be only weakly emissive, with observed
fluorescence quantum yields generally less than 0.1% for excitation
wavelengths across the visible spectral region. In fact, because the
emissions due to the functionalized C60 cages are so weak,
the observed excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence spectra
of the PVK–C60 (Figure 6) are likely contributed significantly by
some minor presence of CDots-like species in the sample formed under
the thermal processing conditions for the copolymerization reaction.
Again in the observed fluorescence spectra (Figure 6), emission features around 725 nm characteristic
of C60 monoadducts57 are more
distinct, which may be considered as a more reliable signature for
the emissive properties of the PVK–C60.

Figure 6 Absorption
(ABS) and fluorescence (FLSC, from left to right corresponding
to excitations at 400, 420, 440, 460, 480, 500, 520, and 540 nm) spectra
of the PVK–C60 in dichlorobenzene solution.

The optical spectroscopy results
presented above clearly demonstrate
the major advantages of the PVK–CDots over the PVK–C60 in terms of much more effective photon-harvesting across
the visible spectrum and also orders of magnitude brighter fluorescence
emissions. In fact, even for excitation of the PVK–C60 at a wavelength such as 540 nm, the observed fluorescence emissions
are “contaminated” significantly by those due to minor
presence of CDots-like species in the sample. Such an assessment is
supported by the fluorescence decay results (Figure 4) and also by the results of fluorescence
quenching associated with photoinduced electron transfers. The average
fluorescence lifetime of the PVK–C60 at 700 nm excitation
is 2.3 ns (Figure 4), close to those of derivatized C60,57 but much longer at 540 nm excitation, 4.3 ns (Figure 4), likely a result
of contributions in the observed decays and associated average lifetime
calculations by the emission components due to the CDots-like species
in the sample.

On the excited state redox characteristics, C60 and
derivatives are known as excellent electron acceptors,11,58 and CDots are similarly so and also even more potent as electron
donors according to already well-established literature results.25,48,59 With N,N-diethylaniline (DEA) as the electron donor quencher, the
Stern–Volmer plots for the PVK–CDots and PVK–C60 (Figure 7) are both slightly downward curved at higher DEA concentrations
(Figure 7). Nevertheless,
the more linear portions of the plots (Figure 7) correspond to Stern–Volmer constants
(KSV) of 1.8 and 5.6 M–1 for the PVK–CDots and PVK–C60, respectively.
The former is an order of magnitude smaller than the KSV values found in those CDots with small organic molecules
such as EDA for surface passivation,48 and
the latter is also substantially smaller than those generally observed
for derivatized C60 molecules (KSV about 17 M–1 for PCBM, as a representative example).57 Thus, the PVK functionalization apparently has
significant negative effect on the excited state electron accepting
characteristics for both CDots and C60. Also, for both
of them, the fluorescence spectral profiles remain unchanged at different
DEA concentrations, suggesting that the emissions being quenched are
emission wavelength-independent with respect to the quenching, the
same as what have been found in similar fluorescence quenching studies
of other CDots.48

Figure 7 Stern–Volmer quenching
plots for fluorescence intensities
of the PVK–CDots in DMF solution (△, 440 nm excitation)
and the PVK–C60 in dichlorobenzene solution (○,
540 nm excitation) at different DEA concentrations.

As electron donor in the photoexcited states, the
PVK–CDots
are as effective as other CDots (the EDA–CDots, for example),59 in sharp contrast to the PVK–C60 of no electron donating ability at all. With the electron deficient
molecule 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) as the quencher for the fluorescence
of the PVK–CDots, the Stern–Volmer plot (Figure 8) suggests not only an extremely
large KSV value of 65 M–1 for the linear portion of the plot but also static quenching reflected
in the upward deviation at still relatively low quencher concentrations.
The corresponding quenching rate constant kq (KSV/τF°) of 1.2 × 1010 M–1 s–1 is beyond the upper limit of
diffusion control. Such an abnormally efficient redox quenching can
be attributed to a large quenching radius beyond the dot surface boundary,
similarly responsible for the static quenching (Figure 8).48,60 On the other hand,
like the parent and derivatized C60 molecules in general,
the PVK–C60 could not serve as the electron donor,
with the fluorescence emissions around 725 nm remaining unchanged
at different DNT concentrations. Because the observed emissions at
shorter wavelengths (450–680 nm, Figure 6) are likely contributed by the CDots-like
species in the PVK–C60 sample, as discussed above,
their relatively minor quenching by DNT could be attributed to the
same origin.

Figure 8 Stern–Volmer quenching plot for fluorescence intensities
(440 nm excitation) of the PVK–CDots in DMF solution at different
DNT concentrations.

PVK polymers are known
for their hole transport functions in various
optoelectronic devices, often based on composites with fullerene derivatives.
As presented above, in the composite-like PVK–C60 sample, the PVK could apparently dampen the characteristic electron
accepting ability of the fullerene cage, as reflected by the smaller
Stern–Volmer constant for the fluorescence quenching by DEA
(Figure 7). The same
dampening effect was found in the PVK–CDots, which could also
be considered as PVK/PVK−CDots composites, with similarly smaller
Stern–Volmer constant for the electron donor quencher DEA.
Mechanistically, the effect is probably not electronic in nature,
as it would have affected the fluorescence properties of the PVK–CDots
in the absence of any external quenchers, inconsistent with their
observed high fluorescence quantum yields (30% or higher). More likely
might be “steric effect” due to the PVK polymers, which
prevent the external quencher molecules from getting to the photoexcited
fullerene cages or CDots in the composite-like samples. Interestingly,
however, the dampening effect is apparently absent in the fluorescence
quenching of the PVK–CDots by DNT, which is consistent with
the observed substantial static quenching contributions (Figure 8) because of a large
effective quenching radius extending beyond the dot surface.48

As compared in the presentation above,
both C60 cages
and the small carbon nanoparticles can participate in radical polymerization
reactions with vinyl molecules. For the PVK–C60,
the mode of such participation must be the radical addition to the
fullerene cage, the same as what is known in similarly synthesized
styrene–C60 and PMMA–C60 copolymers.49−56 A similar radical reaction on the carbon nanoparticle surface is
likely in the formation of the PVK–CDots, in which there are
probably additional surface passivation effects provided by the noncovalent
interactions with the carbazole moieties (Figure 1). The effectiveness of the carbon nanoparticle
surface passivation in the PVK–CDots is reflected by the high
fluorescence performance of the sample, which serves as an interesting
example of potentially far-reaching implications with respect to alternative
surface passivation schemes that adhere to the general definition
on CDots but different from what have been studied in various preparations
of CDots.23,28

On the PVK–CDots versus PVK–C60 as representatives
for CDots versus C60 in electronic polymers represented
by PVK and the relevance of these polymeric composite-like materials
to optoelectronic and other applications, the results on optical properties
and photoinduced redox characteristics show that CDots are more advantageous
in terms of significantly more effective photon-harvesting across
the visible spectrum and for the harvested photon energies to drive
electron accepting and especially highly potent electron donating
functions. Small carbon nanoparticles are obviously more abundant
and inexpensive in comparison with fullerene C60, and their
copolymerization with N-vinylcarbazole for the PVK–CDots
is efficient with high yields. Therefore, further explorations of
CDots copolymerized with PVK and other electronic polymers for uses
in various optoelectronic devices and systems should prove interesting
and valuable.

Conclusions
Small carbon nanoparticles
are similar to fullerene C60 cages, both zero-dimensional
carbon allotropes, on their participation
in radical initiated copolymerization reactions with vinyl monomers
such as N-vinylcarbazole. The resulting PVK–CDots
are structurally the carbon nanoparticles with surface passivation
by the attached PVK polymers, thus adhering to the general definition
on CDots. The PVK–CDots are comparable with and mostly more
advantageous than the corresponding PVK–C60 in terms
of optical properties (more specifically photon-harvesting over the
visible spectrum and bright fluorescence emissions) and photoinduced
redox characteristics. Because fullerene-based composites with electronic
polymers including PVK have found significant applications in optoelectronic
devices and systems, similar or more valuable uses of the CDots functionalized
by electronic polymers such as PVK may be envisaged. In fact, the
same functionalization strategy illustrated here should be broadly
applicable to the preparation of CDots passivated by other widely
used polymers, such as polythiophenes, though for each of them there
will likely be the need to address a specific set of technical issues.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The carbon nanopowder sample (US1074) was
purchased from US Research Nanomaterials, Inc., and C60 (purity > 98%, carbon content > 99.5%) from BuckyUSA. N-Vinylcarbazole and PVK (molecular weight ∼90 000)
were obtained from Acros Organics, DEA from Avocado, and DNT from
TCI. DMF, o-dichlorobenzene, and toluene were supplied
by Burdick & Jackson, diethyl ether by Mallinckrodt Chemicals,
and nitric acid by Fisher Scientific.

Measurement
UV/vis
absorption spectra were recorded
on a Shimadzu UV2501-PC spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were
acquired on a Jobin-Yvon emission spectrometer equipped with a 450
W xenon source, Gemini-180 excitation and Triax-550 emission monochromators,
and a photon counting detector (Hamamatsu R928P PMT at 950 V). The
spectra were corrected for nonlinear instrument response by using
predetermined correction factors specific to the emission spectrometer.
9,10-Bis(phenylethynyl)-anthracene in hexane was used as a standard
in the determination of fluorescence quantum yields by the relative
method (matching the absorbance at the excitation wavelength between
the sample and standard solutions and comparing their corresponding
integrated total fluorescence intensities). Fluorescence decays were
measured on a HORIBA Ultima Extreme spectrometer based on the time-correlated
single photon counting technique, equipped with a SuperK Extreme supercontinuum
laser source pulsed at 10 MHz, TDM-800 excitation and TDM-1200 emission
monochromators, a R3809-50 MCP-PMT detector operated at 3.0 kV in
a thermoelectrically cooled housing, and FluoroHub A+ timing electronics.
The time resolution as characterized by the instrumental response
function of the setup is 100–200 ps (depending on excitation
wavelength). Experimental decay curves were fitted with Das6 fluorescence
decay analysis software. FT-IR spectra were collected on a Shimadzu
IRAffinity-1S spectrometer equipped with the single reflection ATR
accessory for solid samples. TGA was carried out on a TA Instruments
Q600 system.

PVK–CDots
Small carbon nanoparticles
were harvested
from the commercially acquired carbon nanopowder sample in procedures
similar to those reported previously.42 In a typical experiment, the carbon nanopowders (2 g) were refluxed
in concentrated nitric acid (8 M, 200 mL) for 48 h. The reaction mixture
was cooled back to ambient temperature and centrifuged at 1000g to discard the supernatant. The residue was redispersed
in deionized water, dialyzed in a membrane tubing (molecular weight
cutoff ≈ 500) against fresh water for 48 h, and then centrifuged
at 1000g to retain the supernatant as an aqueous
dispersion of small carbon nanoparticles.

A solution of N-vinylcarbazole in DMF (250 mg/mL, 2 mL) was prepared,
and to the solution was added the small carbon nanoparticles (up to
70 mg). The resulting mixture was mildly sonicated, followed by evaporation
to remove DMF. The mixture in a glass tube was thermally treated at
350 °C in a sealed stainless steel reactor for 90 min. Posttreatment,
the reaction mixture was collected and dispersed in toluene, and the
dispersion was precipitated into diethyl ether and then washed repeatedly
with diethyl ether. The brownish solids thus obtained were redispersed
in DMF, followed by centrifuging at 20 000g for 30 min to collect the supernatant as the PVK–CDots in
a DMF solution.

PVK–C60
A C60 sample (30
mg) was added to a solution of N-vinylcarbazole in
dichlorobenzene (200 mg/mL, 1.5 mL). The resulting mixture was mildly
sonicated, followed by evaporation to remove dichlorobenzene. The
mixture in a glass tube was thermally treated at 150 °C in a
sealed stainless steel reactor for 12 h. Posttreatment, the reaction
mixture was collected and dispersed in toluene, and the dispersion
was precipitated into hexane, washed repeatedly with hexane, and then
redispersed in toluene. The dispersion was precipitated into diethyl
ether and then washed repeatedly with diethyl ether. The PVK–C60 was collected as a reddish brown solid sample soluble in
dichlorobenzene.
