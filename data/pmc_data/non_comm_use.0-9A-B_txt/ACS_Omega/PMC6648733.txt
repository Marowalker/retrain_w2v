grafting of starch (STR) and in situ strategic inclusion
of 2-(3-(acrylamido)propylamido)-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (APMPS)
via solution polymerization of 2-(acrylamido)-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid (AMPS) and acrylamide (AM) have resulted in the synthesis of
smart STR-grafted-AMPS-co-APMPS-co-AM (i.e., STR-g-TerPol) interpenetrating terpolymer
(TerPol) network hydrogels. For fabricating the optimum hydrogel showing
excellent physicochemical properties and recyclability, amounts of
ingredients and temperature of synthesis have been optimized using
multistage response surface methodology. STR-g-TerPol
bearing the maximum swelling ability, along with the retention of
network integrity, has been employed for individual and/or simultaneous
removal(s) of metal ions (i.e., M(III)), such as Bi(III) and Sb(III),
and dyes, such as tris(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methylium chloride
(i.e., crystal violet) and (7-amino-8-phenoxazin-3-ylidene)-diethylazanium
dichlorozinc dichloride (i.e., brilliant cresyl blue). The in situ
strategic protrusion of APMPS, grafting of STR into the TerPol matrix,
variation of crystallinity, thermal stabilities, surface properties,
mechanical properties, swellability, adsorption capacities (ACs),
and ligand-selective superadsorption have been inferred via analyses
of unadsorbed and/or adsorbed STR-g-TerPol using
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 1H/13C NMR,
UV–vis, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry,
X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
X-ray, dynamic light scattering, and rheological analyses and measuring
the lower critical solution temperature, % gel content, pH at point
of zero charge (pHPZC), and network parameters, such as
ρc and Mc. The prevalence
of covalent, ionic (I), and variegated interactions between STR-g-TerPol and M(III) has been understood through FTIR analyses,
fitting of kinetics data to the pseudosecond-order model, and by the
measurement of activation energies of adsorption. The formation of
H-aggregate type dimers and hypochromic and hypsochromic shifts has
been explained via UV–vis analyses during individual and/or
simultaneous removal(s) of cationic dyes. Several isotherm models
were fitted to the equilibrium experimental data, of which Langmuir
and combined Langmuir–Freundlich models have been best fitted
for individual Bi(III)/Sb(III) and simultaneous Sb(III) + Bi(III)
removals, respectively. Thermodynamically spontaneous chemisorption
processes have shown the maximum ACs of 1047.39/282.39 and 932.08/137.85
mg g–1 for Bi(III) and Sb(III), respectively, at
303 K, adsorbent dose = 0.01 g, and initial concentration of M(III)
= 1000/30 ppm. The maximum ACs have been changed to 173.09 and 136.02
mg g–1 for Bi(III) and Sb(III), respectively, for
binary Sb(III) + Bi(III) removals at 303 K, adsorbent dose = 0.01
g, and initial concentration of Bi(III)/Sb(III) at 30/5 and 5/30 ppm.

Introduction
Hydrogels are hydrophilic
polymeric networks formed via chemical
or physical bonds that have the unique ability to withstand large
deformations.1 Alongside, high swellability,
elasticity, flexibility, and permeability allow rapid sequestration
of heavy metals via coordination of metal ions with various functional
groups of hydrogels. Accordingly, hydrogels have been drawing attractive
attention because of the various promising applications, such as adsorptive
removals of dyes and/or metal ions,2,3 tissue engineering,4 drug delivery,5 wound
healing materials, biosensors,6 and manufacturing
contact lenses.7 The conventional hydrogels
composed of only natural polymer lack mechanical strength, whereas
synthetic copolymer-based hydrogels show poor reusability and biodegradability,
which limits extensive practical applications.8 Thus, the optimum amount of natural polymer-to-synthetic monomer(s)
is required to fabricate a heterogeneous hydrogel of desired physicochemical
properties suitable for swelling and removals of contaminants.

Now-a-days, a growing global environmental concern is the water
contamination resulted from inappropriate discharge of heavy metal(s)-laden
wastewater from manufacturing industries into aquatic systems, leading
to portable water scarcity, malnutrition, sickness, mass mortality
of aquatic and terrestrial life, and even extinction of species. In
fact, most of the heavy metals are immensely threatening to the living
population because of their carcinogenic, nondegradable, persistent,
and accumulative nature. Antimony (Sb), a toxic heavy metal enlisted
as the priority pollutant, is usually generated from the effluents
of diversified industries, such as hardening of alloys for lead–acid
batteries, battery grids, small arms bullets, ammunition, flame retardants,
clarification of glass products, mining, and cable sheathing. The
major threat of Sb and Sb-based compounds to human body includes easy
combination with sulfhydryl, which affects enzyme activity and destroys
ion balance in cells, leading to cellular hypoxia. Notably, among
various Sb-based components, Sb(III) is the most hazardous and 10
times more toxic than Sb(V). Moreover, bismuth (Bi) compounds are
extensively used for the treatment of syphilis, gastritis, and ulcer,
leading to increased exposure of living beings to Bi. Alongside, Bi-compounds
pose numerous toxic effects, such as nephropathy, osteoarthropathy,
hepatitis, and neuropathology. Thus, removal of Sb and Bi from wastewater
is an essential task for reducing their harmful effects.

In
recent years, more than 10 000 dissimilar toxic synthetic
dyes/pigments in the effluents of textile, leather, paper, plastics,
printing, electroplating, food, and cosmetics industries impart severe
detrimental effect to the ecosystem and environment because of their
carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, teratogenicity, and mutagenicity. Crystal
violet (CV) causes tissue necrosis, cyanosis, jaundice, shock, and
quadriplegia in humans.9 Alongside, brilliant
cresyl blue (BCB) is mainly used as a supravital stain for counting
reticulocytes. However, the presence of these hazardous dyes, even
in low concentration, can pose serious threats to human health. Thus,
removal of dyes from industrial waste effluents is crucial for the
betterment of the environment/ecosystem.

Accordingly, several
cheap and eco-friendly techniques, such as
precipitation,10 ion exchange,11 adsorption,1−3 membrane filtration,12,13 electrodeposition,14 complexation,15 and reverse osmosis,16 have been employed for water purification and metal recovery operations
from wastewater. Of these, adsorption is the universally accepted,
promising, and widely implemented method for water treatment because
of the ease of operation and maintenance, cost-effectiveness, high
efficiency, flexibility, rapidness, simplicity of design, and availability
of diversified adsorbents.

Starch (STR) is a natural, biodegradable,
renewable, and abundantly
available polysaccharide-based biopolymer obtained primarily from
plants and is the major dietary source of carbohydrates. STR granules
are made of mainly two kinds of α-glucan, that is, amylose and
amylopectin, which are about 98–99% of the total weight. STR-based
hydrogels modified by derivatization, grafting, network formation,
and other polymer analogous reactions have drawn attractive attention
in biomedical and pharmaceutical fields because of the natural abundance,
low cost, biocompatibility/biodegradability, and ease of in vivo application(s).

Response surface methodology (RSM) is an empirical statistical
technique adopted for analyzing the simultaneous relationship between
a set of experimental factors and measuring effects of such factors
on responses through the minimum number of runs. As compared to one-factor-at-a-time
design, the experimental design and RSM can effectively reduce runs
and facilitate the execution of runs required for construction of
the response surface. However, RSM has been used for the evaluation
of relative significance of several parameters in the presence of
complex interactions for attaining the maximum adsorption capacity
(AC).17,18 In the present study, RSM has been employed
for systematic multistage optimization of variables for the synthesis
of optimum hydrogel possessing the maximum equilibrium swelling ratio
(ESR).

Meanwhile, several homo-/co-/terpolymers and interpenetrating
polymer
network (IPN)-based polymers containing carboxylic-/sulfonic acid,
amine, and imino acetate groups and natural polymer-grafted copolymers19−21 have been used for the adsorptive removals of heavy metal ions [M(II/III/VI)]
from aqueous solutions. In the last few years, sodium salt of 2-(acrylamido)-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid (AMPS) has received attractive attention as an ionic comonomer
because of the prevalent ionizable sulfonate group, which completely
dissociates in the entire pH range, and thus, the hydrogels derived
from AMPS exhibit pH-independent swelling and superior ion-conducting
ability. Several natural polymer [STR/pectin/guar gum (GG)/gumghatti
(GGTI)]-grafted hydrogels, such as STR-g-poly(acrylic
acid (AA)),22 STR-g-poly(acrylamide
(AM)),23,24 STR-g-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA)),25 STR-g-poly(methyl methacrylate),26 STR-g-poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate),27 STR-g-polystyrene, GG-g-poly(AA-co-AM),2 STR-g-poly(acrylonitrile-co-AMPS),28 GGTI-g-(NIPA-co-3-(N-isopropylacrylamido) sodium propanoate-co-sodium acrylate),1 and synthetic
hydrogels, such as poly(AMPS-co-itaconic acid),29 poly(AM-co-AMPS),30 poly(AM-co-AMPS-co-4-vinylpyridine),31 poly(acrylamidephenylboronic
acid-co-AM),32 poly(N-dodecylacrylamide-co-AMPS),33 and poly(AMPS-co-3-acrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium
chloride),34 have been reported for drug
delivery and adsorptive exclusion of dyes and M(II/III/VI). In this
context, acrylamido functionality was introduced in the matrix using
several AM derivatives, such as 2-acrylamido glycolic acid,35 AMPS,36,37 and 3-(acrylamido)
phenylboronic acid,38 as external monomers
for synthesizing copolymer hydrogels. The in situ adjunct allocation
of the third monomer, that is, 2-(3-(acrylamido)propylamido)-2-methylpropane
sulfonic acid (APMPS), a novel/new monomer within the network of recyclable
STR-g-TerPol via solution polymerization of AMPS
and AM, using the RSM optimized AMPS/AM ratio, temperature, and other
ingredients, extensive microstructural
analyses of Sb(III)/Bi(III)–, Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol and/or unadsorbed hydrogels for individual and/or
simultaneous decontamination of wastewater is reported for the first
time.

Experimental Section
Materials
NaHCO3, Na2B4O7·10H2O, KCl, CH3COOH, CH3COONa, HCl, NaOH, AMPS, AM, STR, MBA,
sodium bisulfite (SBS), and potassium persulfate (PPS) of analytical
grades were purchased from Merck and used without any further modification.
BCB, CV, SbCl3, and Bi(NO3)3 were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Optimization of Synthesis
Parameters
STR-g-TerPols were prepared using
varied AMPS/AM ratios, STR (wt %), MBA
(wt %), and SBS + PPS (wt %) within 2:1–20:1, 1.0–2.0,
0.2–0.8, and 0.6–1.4, respectively, to measure the effect
of these ingredients on % swelling ratio (SR) (−) and ESR systematically.
However, STR-g-TerPol composed of 20:1 mole ratio
of AMPS/AM, 1.5 wt % STR, 0.4 wt % MBA, and 1.0 wt % SBS + PPS showed
good balance between swelling, gelation time, and network integrity.

Synthesis of STR-g-TerPols
STR-g-TerPols were synthesized (Scheme 1) through free-radical solution polymerization,
in which STR was grafted into the TerPol network and APMPS was allocated
in situ using AMPS and AM as ex situ monomers, SBS and PPS as the
redox initiator, and MBA as the cross-linker in N2 atmosphere.
The exact composition of ingredients and reaction temperature were
optimized by RSM via ensuring the maximum swelling of the synthesized
hydrogels, which were prepared by successive incorporation of varied
dosages of AMPS/AM and MBA at different pHi. Initially,
1.5 g of STR was dissolved in 45 mL double distilled water at 323
K using an ultrasonicator to ensure complete dissolution of STR. In
a three-neck reactor, the as-obtained homogeneously dispersed STR
suspension was taken, followed by the dropwise addition of 0.093 mol
AMPS solution prepared in 25 mL water at pHi = 10.5 and
0.010 mol AM solution prepared in 15 mL water. Thereafter, 0.518 mmol
MBA solution prepared in 5 mL water was added at constant temperature
(i.e., 295 K), and the resultant solution was allowed to homogenize
under N2 atmosphere for 12 h. The polymerization reaction
was initiated via gradual addition of SBS+PPS as redox initiators
prepared in 10 mL water by dissolving 0.482 and 0.961 mmol in 10 mL
water, respectively.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of STR-g-TerPol
The as-prepared STR-g-TerPols were allowed to
swell in 1:3 methanol/water (v/v) solution and washed several times
for the complete removal of unreacted monomers, water-soluble oligomers,
and other ingredients. Finally, STR-g-TerPols were
air-dried for 5 days, followed by drying under vacuum for another
2 days.

Characterization
Unadsorbed and/or adsorbed STR-g-TerPols were characterized by the techniques given in Table 1. In addition, STR-g-TerPol was characterized by measuring network parameters,
such as cross-link density (CD, ρc), average molecular
weight between cross-links (Mc), % gel
content (% GC), % graft ratio (% GR), lower critical solution temperature
(LCST), pHPZC, and ESR at different pHi and
temperatures. Moreover, RSM, all graphic-based analyses, and drawing
of chemical structures were carried out using Design-Expert 7.0.0,
Origin 9.0 software, and ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 software, respectively.

Methodology
Solutions of Bi(NO3)3 and SbCl3 were prepared by dissolving
5000 mg each of
the solid salt into 1000 mL distilled water. Solutions within 5–30
and 200–1000 ppm were prepared by exact dilution of the stock
solutions. Dry STR-g-TerPols (0.01 g) were added
to buffer solutions containing 25 mL Bi(III) and Sb(III) for individual
adsorption, whereas 12.5 mL each of Bi(III) and Sb(III) was added
to obtain 25 mL solution of Sb(III) + Bi(III) for simultaneous adsorption.
Thereafter, 25 mL of buffer solution of pHi = 7.0 was added.
In addition, 30 ppm dye solutions were prepared by the exact dilution
of 1000 ppm stock solution. Dry STR-g-TerPol (0.01
g) was added to 50 mL buffer solutions containing 25 mL CV and BCB
for individual adsorption, whereas 12.5 mL each of CV and BCB was
added to obtain 25 mL solution of CV + BCB for simultaneous adsorption,
followed by the addition of 25 mL of buffer solution of pHi = 9.0 at 300 rpm. After predetermined time intervals, the magnetic
stirrer was stopped and the solution was allowed to settle for a couple
of minutes. The progress of adsorption was monitored by withdrawing
the supernatant solution, followed by measuring the absorbance (At) at the respective λmax values to determine the residual concentration (Ct, mg L–1) of metal ion(s) and dye(s) using an atomic absorption spectrometer
(PerkinElmer A-ANALYST 100) and a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer Lambda 365), respectively. From the precalibrated equation,
M(III)/dye(s) concentration (Ct) was calculated, from which AC (qt) (mg g–1) was determined using eq 1. 1  Here, C0/Ct (ppm), V (mL), and ms (g) are feed M(III)/dye(s)
concentrations at t = 0/t, volume
of adsorbate solutions, and mass of STR-g-TerPol,
respectively. After the attainment of equilibrium, the residual concentration
(Ce, mg L–1) was correlated
with the equilibrium AC (qe, mg g–1) in eq 1.

Experimental Design and Model Development for the Synthesis
of STR-g-TerPol
ESR of STR-g-TerPol was observed to depend on several synthesis parameters, such
as amount of AMPS (wt %, A), SBS + PPS (wt %, B), STR (wt %, C), MBA (wt %, D), and pHi (−, E), individually
or simultaneously. The hydrogel possessing the maximum ESR is anticipated
to impart the highest AC for the removal of M(III) and dyes. However,
investigation of such individual and/or simultaneous effect(s) via
one-factor-at-a-time is unempirical, which does not consider two factor
interaction(s) (2FIs) between variables. Therefore, design of experiment
has been introduced to reduce the number of runs and measure the individual
and/or simultaneous effect(s). At first, a fractional factorial design
(resolution-IV) was executed to screen out the most significant parameters
imparting considerable effect on ESR. Alongside, the simultaneous
effects of such significant parameters on ESR were shown through central
composite design (CCD) analysis.

Results and Discussion

Hydrogel Synthesis
Phase-1: Selection of the Most Significant
Variables
In phase-1, screening of variables was conducted
through 11 experiments
using resolution-IV design (Table S1).
The maximum/minimum levels of A, B, C, D, and E were
96.77/83.33 wt %, 1.40/0.60 wt %, 2.00/1.00 wt %, 0.60/0.20 wt %,
and 10.00/4.00, respectively. As A, B, and E crossed the Bonferroni limit of 4.38 in
the Pareto chart (Figure S1), these three
significant variables were considered for further CCD analysis. However,
the adequacy of this model was evaluated through the following polynomial
equation (eq 2): 2  

Indeed, such
model was highly significant
because of the close resemblance between Adj. and Pred. R2 (i.e., 0.9279/0.8479), very high R2 (i.e., 0.9599), and very low p-value (i.e.,
0.0011) (Table S2).

Phase-2:
CCD Optimization of the Significant Variables
The CCD was
introduced for optimizing the three most significant
process variables of synthesis, that is, A, B, and E, considering the individual and
simultaneous effects on ESR. In fact, the ESR of such analyses was
scrutinized and interlinked with input variables for optimization
using the following empirical second-order polynomial equation (eq 3): 3  Here, Y, β0, βm, βmm, and βmn represent the predicted
response, constant, linear, quadratic, and interaction coefficients,
respectively. The applicability of the predicted model was justified
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Table S3), using A, B, and E within 83.33–96.77 wt %, 0.60–1.40 wt %, and 6–11,
respectively. The process variables and software-generated responses
are listed in Table 2. Additionally, the quadratic model was found to be the best among
linear, 2FI, quadratic, and cubic models because of higher R2, that is, 0.9987, and close proximity between
Adj. and Pred. R2 (i.e., 0.9975/0.9916).
In this context, A, B, C, AB, AE, BE, A2, B2, and E2 were found to be significant with a p-value less than 0.05. The final equation generated by
the model in terms of actual factors was reported using eq 4. 4

The response surface plots (Figure 1a–c) showed the simultaneous effects among AB, AE, and BE. Finally,
in the numerical optimization section, A, B, and E were considered in the range along
with the maximum ESR. A, B, and E were found to be 96.34 wt %, 1.05 wt %, and 8.42, respectively.

Swelling and pH Reversibility Studies of TerPol and STR-g-TerPol
The swelling properties of STR-g-TerPol and TerPol were studied at 30 °C and pHi = 2.0, 4.0, 7.0, 9.0, and 12.0 by immersing accurately weighed
STR-g-TerPol and TerPol in 500 mL buffer solution.
The weights of swollen STR-g-TerPol and TerPol were
measured after withdrawing at preselected time intervals, followed
by wiping out the excess solvent. This process was continued until
the weight of the swollen STR-g-TerPol and TerPol
attained the constant value. % SR of STR-g-TerPol
and TerPol were calculated using eq 5. 5  Here, Wi and Wt (g) are weights of STR-g-TerPol and TerPol
at t = 0 and t (min), respectively.
Alongside, ESR was determined replacing Wt by Wf in eq 5.

AMPS-based stimuli-responsive
smart materials generally freeze out
conformational flexibility via gem dimethyl buttressing effect because
of the presence of the two −CH3 at C-1. The pHi-responsive swelling of STR-g-TerPol and
TerPol varied with several synthesis parameters, such as the amounts
of AMPS/AM, SBS + PPS, MBA, and STR, pHi, and temperature.
Indeed, the swelling of hydrogel varies with intrinsic parameters,
such as available free volume, chain relaxation, and ionizable hydrophilic
functional groups, that is, −SO3H, −CONH2, −CH2OH, −OH, and −NH2, capillary effect, and osmotic pressure created because of
the absorption of water.

Swelling kinetics of TerPol and STR-g-TerPol at
different pHi are presented in Figure 2, in which the ESR increased from pHi = 3.0 to 9.0 and then decreased from pHi = 9.0
to 12.0. At pHi > pHPZC, anion–anion
repulsion between −SO3– and a
relatively higher number of free/mobile counterions in the hydrogel
network caused extended chain relaxation. Thus, macromolecular expansion
resulted in the high swelling via imbibing large quantity of water.
However, at a very high pHi = 12.0, STR-g-TerPol ionized rapidly, causing higher counterion concentration
inside the matrix. These counterions reduced the electrostatic repulsion
between polymeric chains and hence reduced ESR. In contrast, reverse
effects were produced at pHi < pHPZC because
of the extensive protonation of −SO3–, leading to lack in electrostatic repulsion between the polymeric
chains and decreased the extent of hydrogen bonding with water. As
a result, ESR was found to be the maximum and minimum at pHi = 9.0 and 2.0, respectively. In this context, better relative population
of hydrophilic functional groups in STR-g-TerPol
resulted in relatively enhanced ESR as compared to that of TerPol.

Calculation of % GC, %
GR, pHPZC, and Network Parameters
of STR-g-TerPol
The % GC, % GR, and pHPZC of STR-g-TerPol, estimated using methods
reported elsewhere,1−3 were calculated to be 75.10%, 9.17%, and 6.62 (Figure 2), respectively.
In addition, the network theory of Flory and Rehner was employed to
determine the network parameters of STR-g-TerPols2 bearing different amounts of STR, MBA, SBS +
PPS, and AMPS/AM (Table 3). STR-g-TerPols showed opposite variation between
CDs and ESR with the increase in MBA from 0.2 to 0.8 wt %. However,
the gradual increase in MBA resulted in moderate enhancement of ρc from 1.425 × 10–9 to 3.774 ×
10–9 via formation of a closely spaced tighter network
of STR-g-TerPols. In fact, such compact network of
hydrogels showed the decrease in Mc from
1.306 × 1011 to 4.933 × 1010. In contrast,
an enhancement of SBS + PPS from 0.6 to 1.0 wt % reduced Mc from 3.212 × 10–8 to 1.604 ×
10–9, and finally, Mc became 1.246 × 10–8 at 1.4 wt % SBS + PPS.
Indeed, a good balance between ESR and ρc was noted
at 1.0 wt % SBS + PPS. Alongside, Mc of
STR-g-TerPols was noted to increase from 6.694 ×
1010 to 1.161 × 1011 as a result of increase
in STR from 1.0 to 1.5 wt %, whereas any further enhancement restricted
the polymerization reaction because of substantial lowering in solution
fluidity. However, the maximum ESR was noted at 1.5 wt % STR. In fact,
ESR and Mc of hydrogels were found to
increase within 158.85–290.56 g g–1 and 2.299
× 1010–1.778 × 1011, respectively,
via increase in AMPS/AM from 2:1 to 20:1, for which ρc inversely varied from 6.481 × 10–9 to 1.046
× 10–9.

Fourier Transform Infrared Analyses
TerPol and STR-g-TerPol
In STR-g-TerPol, grafting
of STR into a synthetic TerPol network
could be realized from the arrival of new peaks at 1123 and 2855 (sh)
cm–1 for −CH2–O–CH2– and −O–CH2–, respectively,
indicating the formation of new ether linkages via reaction between
−CH2–O• of STR and AMPS/AM.
Indeed, such grafting via −CH2–OH was substantiated
from the disappearance of several −C–OH def. peaks of
STR at 1246, 1417, 1423, and 1428 cm–1 in STR-g-TerPol. Notably, the broad spectrum of STR at the higher-frequency
region, consisting of broad peaks at 3151 and 2928 cm–1, along with a shoulder at 3617 cm–1, could be
related to the simultaneous prevalence of unconventional C–H···O
and conventional O–H···O H-bonds (Table S4).

Because STR is mostly populated
with methine C–H carrying greater H-bond-forming ability than
those of >CH2 and −CH3, methine C–H
of pyranose rings acted as the preferred H-bond donor in C–H···O
H-bond.39 However, such reduced broadening
in STR-g-TerPol and the appearance of considerably
sharp and intense peaks at 2926, 1385, and 2874 cm–1 (sh) (Figure 3a)
were related to the facilitated C–H vibrations of free −CH3 in STR-g-TerPol, via replacement of −CH3···O H-bonds with stronger methine C–H···O
H-bonds, leading to altered mutual C–H/O–H/N–H
H-bonding in STR-g-TerPol. Alongside, in both hydrogels,
broad peaks within 2010–2210 cm–1 could be
assigned to C=NH+ and >NH2+ moieties of AM and AMPS, respectively, which might be ascribed to
protein and phosphate monoesters as impurities in STR (Table S4).

(b) STR-g-TerPol, Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol, Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol, and Sb(III)
+ Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol.

Bi(III)–, Sb(III)–, and Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol
In Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol, preferential coordination of Bi(III) with the oxygen of
sulfonates resulted in the arrival of the Bi–O peak at 580
cm–1 in Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol
and the disruption of strong O–H···O–H
and unconventional C–H···O type H-bond, as realized
from the disappearance of the peak at 2347 cm–1 and
the scarcity of free −CH3 in Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol (Table S5). In comparison
to Bi(III), poor interaction between Sb(III) and STR-g-TerPol also resulted in a relatively smaller decrement in −CH2–O–CH2– specific frequency
from 1123 cm–1 of STR-g-TerPol
to 1115 cm–1 in Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol. Moreover, superficial deposition of antimony oxides onto
both Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol was ascertained from the exclusive arrival of broad
peaks centered at 508 and 506 cm–1 (Table S5). In fact, in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol, a part of both Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol specific
peaks was retained. However, it transpired that the coordination of
Bi(III) with the oxygen donor ligands of STR-g-TerPol
deteriorated in the presence of Sb(III), as the Bi–O specific
peak at 580 cm–1 disappeared in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol (Figure 3b), along with the reappearance of peaks at 2312 cm–1 corresponding to strong O–H···O–H H-bond.
Alongside, the availability of free −CH3 in Sb(III)
+ Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol was noted to register
in between those of Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol and
Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol, realized from the lack
of C–H str. at 2932 and 2980 cm–1, while
retaining the −CH3 doublet peaks at 1371 and 1395
cm–1. Thus, as compared to Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol, partial disappearance of free −CH3 again substantiated the retaining of some C–H···O
H-bond in consequence to the affected coordination of Bi(III) with
the oxygen donor ligands in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol. The average coordinating tendency of oxygen donor ligands
in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol was also
envisaged from the intermediate values of −CH2–O–CH2– peak positioned in between those of Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol.
Besides, in all the metal ion-adsorbed hydrogels, complete disappearance
of broad peaks within 2010–2210 cm–1 could
be because of deprotonation of C=NH+ and >NH2+ during adsorption at the neutral pHi.

1H NMR Analyses
The incorporation of AMPS
within TerPol and STR-g-TerPol was inferred from
the characteristic peaks at 1.45/2.84 and 1.42/2.84 ppm for −CH3/–CH2–SO3H of AMPS in TerPol and STR-g-TerPol, respectively.
Moreover, the −CH2– and >CH– units resulted through free-radical polymerization
of AMPS, AM, and MBA, which were confirmed from the characteristic
peaks within 1.05–1.78/2.16–2.70 and 0.84–1.57/2.07–2.62
ppm (Figure 4a,b) in
TerPol and STR-g-TerPol, respectively. Alongside,
the complete disappearance of vinylic proton-specific peaks within
6.03–6.59, 5.70–6.30, and 5.59–6.13 ppm for AMPS,
AM, and MBA, respectively, supported the formation of a saturated
network via polymerization reaction. In this context, cross-linking
by MBA was ascertained through the appearance of characteristic −CH2– peaks at 4.31 and 4.32 ppm in TerPol
and STR-g-TerPol, respectively. However, the appearance
of new peaks within 3.60–3.70 and 3.49–3.54 ppm in TerPol
and STR-g-TerPol, respectively, inferred the formation
of −CONH–CH2– fragment
via in situ polymerization between AM and AMPS.40,41 In this context, the −CONH– of AMPS,
cross-linked MBA, and newly formed −CONH–CH2– units appeared at 7.30 and 7.90 ppm in TerPol and
at 6.98, 7.09, 7.53, and 7.72 ppm in STR-g-TerPol.

STR is a natural polysaccharide consisting of a large number of
glucopyranose units connected through α-(1 → 4) and α-(1
→ 4)/α-(1 → 6) linkages of amylose and amylopectin,
respectively. The characteristic peaks within 5.39–5.49 and
4.90–5.06 ppm which were related to H-1(1 →
4) and H-1(1 → 6), respectively, inferred the
presence of (1 → 4)- and/or (1 → 6)-linked glucopyranose
unit(s) in STR.42,43 Moreover, the peaks within 3.58–3.60
ppm were assigned to H-2 and H-4 of glucopyranose
(Figure 4c). However,
incorporation of STR within STR-g-TerPol was confirmed
from the arrival of several distinct STR-specific peaks at 5.34, 5.07,
and 3.64 ppm, assigned to H-1(1 → 4), H-1(1 → 6), and ring protons, respectively.

13C NMR Analyses
In 13C NMR,
the incorporation of AMPS within STR-g-TerPol was
inferred from the appearance of characteristic peaks at 30.36, 54.79,
and 63.60 ppm for −CH3, −CONHC(Me)2–, and −CH2–SO3H of AMPS, respectively. Moreover, −CH2– of MBA, −CH2–/>CH– of backbone, and −CONHCH2– of a strategically incorporated APMPS
monomer appeared within 38.98–45.05 ppm. In addition, the in
situ/ex situ allocation of pendant primary and secondary amides in
backbone was inferred through the presence of characteristic −CONH–/–CONH2 specific
peak at 178.28 ppm.

The 13C NMR of STR showed several
characteristics peaks at 100.15, 78.84, 73.31, 72.05, 71.68, and 60.56
ppm (Figure S2) for C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5,
and C-6 of glucopyranose, respectively.44,45 In this context, modification via grafting into the TerPol network
was ascertained from the shifting of several STR-specific peaks (Figure 4d) within 106.75–111.79
and 70.44–82.65 ppm for the anomeric carbon (i.e., C-1) and ring carbons (i.e., C-2–C-6), respectively.

Thermogravimetric Analyses of STR-g-TerPol
and Sb(III)–/Bi(III)–/Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol
Grafting of STR into TerPol (Table S4) enhanced the thermal stability of STR
in STR-g-TerPol, which were envisaged from the almost
similar degradation pattern of both TerPol and STR-g-TerPol above 330 °C (Figure 5a). However, within 30–330 °C, relatively
higher mass loss for STR-g-TerPol as compared to
TerPol was attributed to the higher moisture loss from the STR moieties
of STR-g-TerPol. From 330 to 345 °C, rapid mass
losses of 30 wt % for both TerPol and STR-g-TerPol
were attributed to the degradation of sulfonic groups. Importantly,
delayed mass loss beyond 330 °C and thus, radically elevated
thermal stability of Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol
over STR-g-TerPol could be ascribed to the restricted
degradation of sulfonic groups coordinated with the adsorbed Bi(III).
On contrary, relatively rapid mass loss for both Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol could be attributed to the lack of complexation of sulfonic
groups with the adsorbed Sb(III). Notably, similar nature of plots
for both Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III)
+ Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol and diminished complex-forming
ability of Bi(III) with the sulfonic groups in the presence of Sb(III)
were also envisaged from the disappearance of the Bi–O peak
at 580 cm–1 in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol. In the presence of Sb(III), relatively reduced
adsorption of Bi(III) in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol was realized via similar residue content of 11.78 and 11.15
wt % for Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III)
+ Bi(III)–STR-g-(TerPol), respectively. However,
in the absence of Sb(III), possibly elevated complexation between
Bi(III) and sulfonic groups and associated huge adsorption of Bi(III)
resulted in a substantially higher residue content of 44.08 wt % for
Bi(III)–STR-g-(TerPol). Higher adsorption
of Bi(III) over Sb(III) in STR-g-TerPol was also
substantiated from the fact that the entire residue content of Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol is predominantly constituted of metallic Bi and
carbon, whereas for Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol,
the residue was composed of Sb2O3 and carbon.1 Besides, sharp degradation of both Sb(III) +
Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol beyond 220 °C was associated with the relative
ease of amide to imide conversion. Altogether, as compared to Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol, relatively poor thermal stabilities of Sb(III)
adsorbed hydrogels could be related to the fewer population and weaker
association of Sb(III) within the bulk of STR-g-TerPol,
resulting in superficial deposition of antimony oxide-type particles
onto Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol (Figure S3).

Differential Scanning Calorimetry Analyses
Grafting
of STR into TerPol was substantiated from the relatively restricted
thermal degradation of STR-g-TerPol than STR in the
entire temperature range, as envisaged from the shift of all endothermic
peaks of STR toward higher temperatures in STR-g-TerPol,
along with the significant alteration in intensities. Indeed, slightly
elevated thermal stability of STR-g-TerPol as compared
to TerPol could also be realized from the conversion of a sharp peak
at 340 °C of TerPol to a broad shoulder in STR-g-TerPol, suggesting grafting-assisted change in the nature of degradation
of sulfonic groups (Figure 5c). In Bi(III)−STR-g-TerPol, relatively
delayed thermal degradation was observed from the omission of STR-g-TerPol-specific endothermic peak at 379 °C, resulted
from the possible stabilization of sulfonates via complexation, supported
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). On the contrary, almost similar
plots were resulted for Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol
and Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol. In fact,
almost identical endothermic peaks were originated within 200–205
and 300–307 °C, suggesting a pivotal role of Sb(III) in
controlling the thermal degradation behavior of Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol (Figure 5d). Accordingly, in the presence of Sb(III), relatively poor
adsorption of Bi(III) into STR-g-TerPol was substantiated
from the similarity of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) plots
of both Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III) +
Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol.

LCST Studies of TerPol
and STR-g-TerPol
As compared to TerPol,
the relative lowering of LCST in STR-g-TerPol was
ascribed to the relatively deteriorated low-temperature
stability of the STR-g-TerPol microstructure, facilitating
easier temperature-dependent reversible collapsing through conformational
changes, analogous to coil-to-globule transition (Figure 5b). Indeed, easier coil-to-globule
transition and associated faster denaturation of STR-g-TerPol were assisted by the severe rupture of pre-existing strong
O–H···O–H-bonds in TerPol, as realized
from the disappearance of O–H str. peaks (Figure 3a) in STR-g-TerPol via grafting-assisted structural alteration and associated
changes in H-bonding environment through intermixing of phases (Figure S3). Such low-temperature instability
of STR-g-TerPol than TerPol could also be substantiated
by a relatively greater mass loss from STR-g-TerPol
as compared to TerPol (Figure 5a).

X-ray Diffraction Analyses
Grafting
of STR into TerPol
resulted in severe intermixing of phases via intermingling of macromolecular
moieties, leading to the disappearance of several sharp STR-specific
peaks in STR-g-TerPol (Figure S3a). In this context, relatively amorphous characteristics
of STR-g-TerPol could be exemplified in consequence
to the interpenetration of chains, resulting in the marked deterioration
of the pre-existing short-range order in STR. Notably, crystalline
nature was further deteriorated in the metal ion-adsorbed STR-g-TerPol, especially in Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol (Figure S3b). However, few sharp
peaks in Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol were attributed
to the superficial deposition of crystalline particulate matters based
on antimony oxide (Figure S3b), detected
from the peaks of variable intensities at 15.03, 28.96, 30.14, 38.03,
42.98, 45.92, and 58.82° for (111), (311), (222), (331), (422),
(511), and (533) planes of antimony oxide, respectively. In this regard,
small peaks between 45.92° and 45.95° could be assigned
to the variable Sb–O bond distances of 1.9–2.2 Å.46 In fact, all the characteristic peaks of Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol were almost retained in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol, suggesting superficial attachment tendency of
Sb(III) onto STR-g-TerPol. In fact, such peaks were
unaltered in Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol,
as Bi(III) showed the tendency to penetrate deep inside the bulk of
STR-g-TerPol rather than staying at the surface.

Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Analyses
The photomicrograph of STR-g-TerPol demonstrated characteristic layered structures constituting
of partly indistinct strata (Figure 6). In this regard, multiple phases in STR-g-TerPol were resulted via interpenetration of macromolecular chains,
leading to deterioration of the short-range order existing in STR
(Figure S3).

and (d) Bi(III)–/Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol;
the inset of b–d shows EDX spectra of respective
M(III).

In Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol, the absence of
superficial particulate depositions, along with rough topological
features devoid of phase boundaries, was substantiated from the absence
of peaks in diffractogram because of the intimate interactions among
the bulk/surface of STR-g-TerPol and the adsorbed
Bi(III) (Figure S3b). On the contrary,
both Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol showed depositions of antimony oxides (Figure S3), substantiating the relative abundance
and scarcity of Sb(III) at the surface and bulk, respectively. Such
depositions were responsible for the inferior thermal resistance of
both Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol and Sb(III) + Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol (Figure 5a).

From energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (inset
of Figure 6b–d),
the
appearance of different intense peaks supported variegated interactions
between Sb(III)/Bi(III) and STR-g-TerPol through
ionic/coordinate bonding. Indeed, the presence of such oxides of Bi(III)
was substantiated by the characteristic peaks of Bi(III) and oxygen
in the EDX spectrum, as apprehended earlier in Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra (Figure 3b).

Rheological Analyses
The frequency sweep study of swollen
TerPol and STR-g-TerPol, obtained through grafting
of different amounts of STR into TerPol, was carried out to realize
the relative alterations in rheological and viscoelastic properties.
However, an incorporation of 0.5 wt % STR into TerPol resulted in
the significant enhancement of storage modulus (G′) through the attainment of extra cross-linking and compact
structure of H-bonded STR. Moreover, G′ increased
further with the change in STR from 0.5 to 1.5 wt % (Figure 7). Thereafter, a marginal change
in G′ with further increase in STR above 1.5
wt % was ascribed to the attainment of an entangled complex network.
However, G″ followed the similar kind of variation,
in which G′ was always greater than G″. In fact, the obsolescence of crossover point
within 0–100 rad s–1 indicated that the as-prepared
hydrogels were more elastic than viscous.47

and STR-g-TerPols.

Adsorption Isotherm, Kinetics, and Thermodynamics Studies
Adsorption isotherm studies express the nature of interaction between
the adsorbate and adsorbent. The equilibrium experimental data were
fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) isotherms (eqs 6–8), of which the Langmuir model (Figure 8a–d) fitted
the best (Table 4).
The ligand selectivity of STR-g-TerPol toward M(III)
adsorption was corroborated from the qmax values in the following order: Bi(III) (1046.32 mg g–1) > Sb(III) (932.08 mg g–1). The higher binding
affinity of Bi(III) with N-/O-donor elevated the AC for STR-g-TerPol. In this regard, separation factor (RL) (eq 9)
measuring the feasibility of adsorption, in which RL > 1, 0 < RL < 1, RL = 1, and RL =
0 indicates unfavorable, favorable, linear, and irreversible adsorptions,
respectively, was found to vary within 0–1, indicating spontaneous
adsorption. 6   7   8  Here, kL/kF/k1/k2 and qmax/n/qBET are isotherm constant and isotherm
parameter, respectively. 9

The adsorption mechanism was studied through
fitting of the kinetics
data to pseudofirst-/-second-order kinetics models (Figures S4 and S5). Better fitting of the pseudosecond-order
kinetics equation (eq 11) than the pseudofirst-order equation (eq 10) suggested the prevalence of chemisorption48 (Table 4) through ionic and variegated coordinative interactions between
O-donor of −SO3–/N-donor of >N–/–NH2 in STR-g-TerPol and M(III). The activation
energies (Ea) of adsorption, calculated
using the Arrhenius-type equation (eq 12), were 22.58 and 23.08 kJ mol–1 for
Bi(III) and Sb(III), respectively, indicating the prevalence of chemisorption.49,50 The spontaneity of the chemisorption was inferred from −ΔG0 equation (eq 13) for all M(III). 10   11   12   13  Here,
distribution coefficient (kd) is defined
as the ratio of M(III) concentrations in
solid to liquid phases at equilibrium (eq 14). 14   15  

Again, the exothermic nature of adsorption was understood
from
negative ΔH0 (Table 5), as calculated by van’t Hoff’s
equation (eq 15), whereas
the positive ΔS0 suggested fair
affinity between M(III) and STR-g-TerPol and the
decrease in randomness at the solid–solution interface during
adsorption (Figure S6).

Simultaneous Adsorption of Sb(III) and Bi(III)
by STR-g-TerPol
For binary adsorption, that
is, for simultaneous
removal of Sb(III) + Bi(III), qe and Ce were fitted to nonlinear competitive Langmuir,
noncompetitive Langmuir, and combined Langmuir–Freundlich models
of adsorption expressed by eqs 16–18, respectively, with multiple
regression for surface fitting. 16   17   18  Here, i/j, qei, qmax′, KL,i/KL,j, KL,ii/KL,j, and KLF,i/KLF,j are Bi(III)/Sb(III), equilibrium
AC of i, maximum AC, competitive, noncompetitive
Langmuir, and combined Langmuir–Freundlich model parameters,
respectively.

In simultaneous adsorption of Sb(III) + Bi(III),
restriction toward interaction, imposed during simultaneous adsorption,
was inferred via substantial decrease in qe of both Bi(III) and Sb(III) as compared to the individual qe. In this context, qe of Bi(III) and Sb(III) were 143.11 and 123.91 mg g–1 at 30 ppm that reduced to 141.25 and 115.75 mg g–1, respectively, in simultaneous adsorption of Bi(III)/Sb(III) at
30/5 and 5/30 ppm (Figure 9a–d). However, the noncompetitive Langmuir model fitted
the best as compared to the competitive model, realized through very
high R2/F (i.e., 0.9813/2053.08)
(Table 6). In fact,
FTIR, TGA, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses confirmed
that Bi(III) penetrated deep inside the bulk to bind with O- and N-donor,
whereas Sb(III) deposited onto the surface (Figure 6) and preferentially coordinated with the
O-donor. As a consequence, substantial deposition of Sb(III) onto
the surface of STR-g-TerPol imposed restriction for
the penetration of Bi(III) toward bulk and, resulting in reduced qe (Scheme 2). It is tantamount to note that the combined Langmuir–Freundlich
model fitted the best, reflecting mutual interaction between metal
ions and surface heterogeneity of the adsorbents.

Individual
and/or Simultaneous Adsorption of BCB and CV at pHi = 9.0
The time-dependent UV–vis absorption
spectra of the BCB solution constituted of BCB+ monomer-specific
λmax at 624 nm, accompanied by a dimer-specific shoulder
at 580 nm, suggesting the coexistence of BCB+ monomers
and some H-aggregate type BCB dimers in aqueous solution during the
entire period of absorption (Figure 10a).51 In this regard, the
aqueous solution of BCB+ was devoid of the peak corresponding
to J-aggregate type dimers, as flat aromatic structures of cationic
BCB dyes tend to form the stacking-type face-to-face aggregate in
aqueous medium. Indeed, a time-dependent slow hypochromic effect was
observed in both the peak and shoulder, with complete obsolescence
of shoulder at equilibrium, suggesting breakdown and conversion of
BCB+ dimers into monomers at the relatively higher dilution.
On the contrary, relatively rapid adsorption of CV displayed an initial
λmax at 587 nm and a shoulder at 546 nm, which was
ascribed to the coexistence of a pyramidal and planar CV+ monomer, of which the planar CV+ monomer formed dimers
or aggregates of higher order at lower dilution. Within first 30 min,
the shoulder became increasingly prominent and eventually transformed
into a broad peak shifted to 514 nm (Figure 10b). Such phenomenon was ascribed to the
relatively rapid and preferential attachment of tiny pyramidal CV+ monomers with the STR-g-TerPol, whereas
relatively bulkier dimers or aggregates of planer dimers were considerably
reluctant to get adhered with the adsorbent. Notably, beyond 30 min,
a considerable hypsochromic shift was observed from 546 to 514 nm,
along with the consistent hypochromic effect for the CV+ monomer-specific peak. Such a bathochromic shift could be ascribed
to the breakdown of higher-order aggregates into CV+ dimers
and monomers because of increasing dilution. Accordingly, in the combined
adsorption spectra, preferable CV+ absorption into STR-g-TerPol was noted to supersede the adsorption of BCB+, as the time-dependent combined adsorption spectra showed
the faster hypochromic effect at 587 nm, in addition to the progressively
prominent appearance of a BCB+-specific shoulder at 624
nm. In this regard, strong inter chromophoric interaction was less
likely as the characteristic λmax of both BCB+ and CV+ were deviated marginally (Figure 10c). However, dimer or higher-order
aggregate-specific peaks of both the dyes disappeared, as the initial
concentration of both the individual dye components was reduced from
30 to 15 ppm. Nevertheless, in the presence of BCB+, the
adsorbing tendency of CV+ onto STR-g-TerPol
was retarded because of the common ion effect.

Desorption and Reusability
The recyclability of STR-g-TerPol was studied
by carrying out repetitive adsorption/desorption
studies at pHi = 7.0/2.0 (Figure 10d). The extent of desorption was approximately
90% for Sb(III)–STR-g-TerPol, whereas the
extent of desorption remained within 80–85% for Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol. The excellent reusability of STR-g-TerPol could be explained by measuring very high ACs even after
the completion of five cycles. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique
was employed for determining the particle size of STR-g-TerPol. The sizes of particles in solution were determined using
the following Stokes–Einstein eq 19.52 19  Here, D, k, η, T, and Rh are diffusion coefficient, Boltzmann’s constant, viscosity
coefficient, temperature, and hydrodynamic radius of the particles
in solution, respectively. DLS study was executed for hydrodynamic
radius estimation of both unadsorbed STR-g-TerPol
and desorbed STR-g-TerPol obtained after the attainment
of five complete cycles of the recyclability experiment, in which
the particle size varied within 131.5–121.2 nm without a significant
loss of network (Figure 10e,f). Thus, STR-g-TerPol showed the excellent
reusability.

Comparison of the Results
Several
low-cost natural,
physicochemically modified micro-/nanomaterials, blends, homo-/co-/ter-polymers,
IPNs, and composite hydrogels have been employed for the adsorptive
decontamination of Bi(III) and Sb(III) at varying initial concentrations
(i.e., 0–20 000 ppm), temperatures (i.e., 293–323
K), and pHi (i.e., 2.8–11.0) (Table S6). From Table S6, the ACs
of STR-g-TerPol were found to be excellent as compared
to previously reported macromolecular adsorbents.

Conclusions
The present work reports the unorthodox fabrication of a series
of reusable STR-g-TerPol superadsorbents through
grafting of STR into the TerPol network formed via in situ allocation
of the APMPS monomer by N–H activation. The synthesis of the
TerPol network, via ex situ addition of only two monomers and in situ
adjunct allocation of APMPS, was inferred from the arrival of −CONH–CH2– specific 1H NMR peaks within 3.49–3.54
ppm. The one-pot grafting of STR into the TerPol network resulted
in −CH2–O–CH2– linkage
in STR-g-TerPol, inferred from 1H/13C NMR and FTIR analyses. Alongside, the grafting of STR was
confirmed through −CH2–O–CH2– str. at 1123 cm–1 and several STR-specific
peaks within 106.75–111.79 and 70.44–82.65 ppm for the
anomeric carbon and ring carbons, respectively. As compared to Sb(III),
the preferential interaction of Bi(III) with O-donor resulted in the
arrival of a Bi–O-specific peak at 580 cm–1 in Bi(III)–STR-g-TerPol. Consequently, the
higher adsorption of Bi(III) over Sb(III) resulted in homogeneous
bulk-/surface distribution of Bi(III) rendering higher residue in
TGA thermogram, supported by DSC and SEM analyses. The replacement
of −CH3···O type H-bonds with stronger
nonconventional C–H···O H-bonds donated mostly
by the methine of grafted STR significantly altered the C–H
str. of STR-g-TerPol, producing considerably sharp
and intense peaks at 2926, 1385, and 2874 cm–1.
Such nonconventional H-bonds were affected significantly via adsorption
of Bi(III) instead of Sb(III). In the simultaneous adsorption, the
decrease in AC of Bi(III) was ascribed to the restricted penetration
of Bi(III) deep inside the STR-g-TerPol that resulted
via extensive surface deposition of Sb(III)-components. The introduction
of this new pathway can be adopted for the synthesis of APMPS-based
TerPols, without orthodox ex situ addition of APMPS or equivalent
monomers. The systematic design of STR-g-TerPol bearing
excellent recyclability, performance characteristics, outstanding
superadsorption efficiency, and diversified application prospects
for individual and/or simultaneous removal(s) of M(III) and cationic
dyes has shown the novelty in a kinetically fast and thermodynamically
spontaneous waste remediation process. STR-g-TerPol
showing excellent physicochemical and thermomechanical properties
may also be attempted for drug delivery, tissue engineering, membrane-based
separation, and self-healing materials.
